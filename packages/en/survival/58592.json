My aim has been to make a practically useful\r\nbook. With this view, I have treated of the several breeds of stock, the\r\ndiseases to which they are subject, the established principles of\r\nbreeding, the feeding and management of milch cows, the raising of\r\ncalves intended for the dairy, and the culture of grasses and plants to\r\nbe used as fodder.\r\n\r\nFor the chapter on the diseases of stock, I am largely indebted to Dr.\r\nC. M. Wood, Professor of the Theory and Practice of Veterinary Medicine,\r\nand to Dr. Geo. H. Dadd, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, both of\r\nthe Boston Veterinary Institute. If this chapter contributes anything to\r\npromote a more humane and judicious treatment of cattle when suffering\r\nfrom disease, I shall feel amply repaid for the labor bestowed upon the\r\nwhole work.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the Dutch dairy, which I have translated from the German,\r\nwill be found to be of great practical value, as suggesting much that is\r\napplicable to our American dairies. This chapter has never before, to my\r\nknowledge, appeared in English.\r\n\r\nThe full and complete explanation of Guénon’s method of judging and\r\nselecting milch cows,--a method originally regarded as theoretical, but\r\nnow generally admitted to be very useful in practice,--I have translated\r\nfrom the last edition of the treatise of M. Magne, a very sensible\r\nFrench writer, who has done good service to the agricultural public by\r\nthe clearness and simplicity with which he has freed that system from\r\nits complicated details.\r\n\r\nThe work will be found to contain an account of the most enlightened\r\npractice in this country, in the statements those actually engaged in\r\ndairy farming; the details of the dairy husbandry of Holland, where this\r\nbranch of industry is made a specialty to greater extent, and is\r\nconsequently carried to a higher degree of perfection, than in any other\r\npart of the world; and the most recent and productive modes of\r\nmanagement in English dairy farming, embracing a large amount of\r\npractical and scientific information, not hitherto presented to the\r\nAmerican public in an available form.\r\n\r\nNothing need be said of the usefulness of a treatise on the dairy. The\r\nnumber of milch cows in the country, forming so large a part of our\r\nmaterial wealth, and serving as a basis for the future increase and\r\nimprovement of every class of neat stock, on which the prosperity of our\r\nagriculture mainly depends; the intrinsic value of milk as an article of\r\ninternal commerce, and as a most healthy and nutritious food; the vast\r\nquantity of it made into butter and cheese, and used in every family;\r\nthe endless details of the management, feeding, and treatment, of dairy\r\nstock, and the care and attention requisite to obtain from this branch\r\nof farming the highest profit, all concur to make the want of such a\r\ntreatise, adapted to our climate and circumstances, felt not only by\r\npractical farmers, but by a large class of consumers, who can appreciate\r\nevery improvement which may be made in preparing the products of the\r\ndairy for their use.\r\n\r\nThe writer has had some years of practical experience in the care of a\r\ncheese and butter dairy, to which has been added a wide range of\r\nobservation in some of the best dairy districts of the country; and it\r\nis hoped that the work now submitted to the public will meet that degree\r\nof favor usually accorded to an earnest effort to do something to\r\nadvance the cause of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.--THE VARIOUS RACES OF PURE-BRED CATTLE IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milking qualities of our domestic cows are, to some extent,\r\nartificial, the result of care and breeding. In the natural or wild\r\nstate, the cow yields only enough to nourish her offspring for a few\r\nweeks, and then goes dry for several months, or during the greater part\r\nof the year. There is, therefore, a constant tendency to revert to that\r\ncondition, which is prevented only by judicious treatment, designed to\r\ndevelop and increase the milking qualities so valuable to the human\r\nrace. If this judicious treatment is continued through several\r\ngenerations of the same family or race of animals, the qualities which\r\nit is calculated to develop become more or less fixed, and capable of\r\ntransmission. Instead of being exceptional, or peculiar to an\r\nindividual, they become the permanent characteristics of a breed. Hence\r\nthe origin of a great variety of breeds or races, the characteristics of\r\neach being due to local circumstances such as climate, soil, and the\r\nspecial objects of the breeder, which may be the production of milk,\r\nbutter and cheese, or the raising of beef or working cattle.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the history of different breeds, and especially of the\r\ndairy breeds, is of manifest importance. Though very excellent milkers\r\nwill sometimes be found in all of them, and of a great variety of forms,\r\nthe most desirable dairy qualities will generally be found to have\r\nbecome fixed and permanent characteristics of some to a greater extent\r\nthan of others; but it does not follow that a race whose milking\r\nqualities have not been developed is of less value for other purposes,\r\nand for qualities which have been brought out with greater care. A brief\r\nsketch of the principal breeds of American cattle, as well as of the\r\ngrades or the common stock of the country, will aid the farmer, perhaps,\r\nin making an intelligent selection with reference to the special object\r\nof pursuit, whether it be the dairy, the production of beef, or the\r\nraising of cattle for work.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent chapter on the selections of milch cows, the standard of\r\nperfection will be discussed in detail, and the characteristics of each\r\nof the races will naturally be measured by that. In this connection, and\r\nas preliminary to the following sketches, it may be stated that,\r\nwhatever breed may be selected, a full supply of food and proper shelter\r\nare absolutely essential to the maintenance of any milking stock, the\r\nfood of which goes to supply not only the ordinary waste of the system\r\ncommon to all animals, but also the milk secretions, which are greater\r\nin some than in others. A large animal on a poor pasture has to travel\r\nmuch further to fill itself than a small one. A small or medium-sized\r\ncow would return more milk in proportion to the food consumed, under\r\nsuch circumstances, than a large one.\r\n\r\nIn selecting any breed, therefore, regard should be had to the\r\ncircumstances of the farmer, and the object to be pursued. The cow most\r\nprofitable for the milk-dairy may be very unprofitable in the butter\r\nand cheese dairy, as well as for the production of beef; while for\r\neither of the latter objects the cow which gave the largest quantity of\r\nmilk might prove very unprofitable. It is desirable to secure a union\r\nand harmony of all good qualities, so far as possible; and the farmer\r\nwants a cow that will milk well for some years, and then, when dry,\r\nfatten readily, and sell to the butcher for the highest price. These\r\nqualities, though often supposed to be incompatible, will be found to be\r\nunited in some breeds to a greater extent than in others; while some\r\npeculiarities of form have been found, by observation, to be better\r\nadapted to the production of milk and beef than others. This will appear\r\nin the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Ayrshire Cow, imported and owned by Dr. Geo. B.\r\nLoring, Salem, Mass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AYRSHIRES are justly celebrated throughout Great Britain and this\r\ncountry for their excellent dairy qualities. Though the most recent in\r\ntheir origin, they are pretty distinct from the other Scotch and English\r\nraces. In color, the pure Ayrshires are generally red and white,\r\nspotted or mottled, not roan like many of the short-horns, but often\r\npresenting a bright contrast of colors. They are sometimes, though\r\nrarely, nearly or quite all red, and sometimes black and white; but the\r\nfavorite color is red and white brightly contrasted, and by some,\r\nstrawberry-color is preferred. The head is small, fine, and clean; the\r\nface long, and narrow at the muzzle, with a sprightly yet generally mild\r\nexpression; eye small, smart, and lively; the horns short, fine, and\r\nslightly twisted upwards, set wide apart at the roots; the neck thin;\r\nbody enlarging from fore to hind quarters; the back straight and narrow,\r\nbut broad across the loin; joints rather loose and open; ribs rather\r\nflat; hind quarters rather thin; bone fine; tail long, fine and bushy at\r\nthe end; hair generally thin and soft; udder light color and capacious,\r\nextending well forward under the belly; teats of the cow of medium size,\r\ngenerally set regularly and wide apart; milk-veins prominent and well\r\ndeveloped. The carcass of the pure-bred Ayrshire is light, particularly\r\nthe fore quarters, which is considered by good judges as an index of\r\ngreat milking qualities; but the pelvis is capacious and wide over the\r\nhips.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the Ayrshire is good-looking, but wants some of the\r\nsymmetry and aptitude to fatten which characterize the short-horn, which\r\nis supposed to have contributed to build up this valuable breed on the\r\nbasis of the original stock of the county of Ayr; a county extending\r\nalong the eastern shore of the Frith of Clyde, in the south-western part\r\nof Scotland, and divided into three districts, known as Carrick,\r\nCunningham, and Kyle: the first famous as the lordship of Robert Bruce,\r\nthe last for the production of this, one of the most remarkable dairy\r\nbreeds of cows in the world. The original stock of this county, which\r\nundoubtedly formed the basis of the present Ayrshire breed, are\r\ndescribed by Aiton, in his _Treatise on the Dairy Breed of Cows_, as of\r\na diminutive size, ill fed, ill shaped, and yielding but a scanty return\r\nin milk. They were mostly of a black color, with large stripes of white\r\nalong the chine and ridge of their backs, about the flanks, and on their\r\nfaces. Their horns were high and crooked, having deep ringlets at the\r\nroot,--the plainest proof that the cattle were but scantily fed; the\r\nchine of their backs stood up high and narrow; their sides were lank,\r\nshort, and thin; their hides thick, and adhering to their bones; their\r\npile was coarse and open; and few of them yielded more than six or eight\r\nquarts of milk a day when in their best plight, or weighed when fat more\r\nthan from twelve to sixteen or twenty stones avoirdupois, at eight\r\npounds the stone, sinking offal.\r\n\r\n“It was impossible,” he continues, “that these cattle, fed as they then\r\nwere, could be of great weight, well shaped, or yield much milk. Their\r\nonly food in winter and spring was oat-straw, and what they could pick\r\nup in the fields, to which they were turned out almost every day, with a\r\nmash of weak corn and chaff daily for a few days after calving; and\r\ntheir pasture in summer was of the very worst quality, and eaten so bare\r\nthat the cattle were half starved, and had the aspect of starvelings. A\r\nwonderful change has since been made in the condition, aspect, and\r\nqualities, of the Ayrshire dairy stock. They are not now the meagre,\r\nunshapely animals they were about forty years ago; but have completely\r\nchanged into something as different from what they were then as any two\r\nbreeds in the island can be from each other. They are almost double the\r\nsize, and yield about four times the quantity of milk that the Ayrshire\r\ncows then yielded. They were not of any specific breed, nor uniformity\r\nof shapes or color; neither was there any fixed standard by which they\r\ncould be judged.”\r\n\r\nAiton wrote in 1815, and even then the Ayrshire cattle had been\r\ncompletely changed from what they were in 1770, and had, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, at least, settled down into a breed with fixed\r\ncharacteristics, distinguished especially for an abundant flow and a\r\nrich quality of milk. A large part of the improvement then manifested\r\nwas due to better feeding and care, but much, no doubt, to judicious\r\ncrossing. Strange as it may seem, considering the modern origin of this\r\nbreed, “all that is certainly known is that a century ago there was no\r\nsuch breed as Cunningham or Ayrshire in Scotland. Did the Ayrshire\r\ncattle arise entirely from a careful selection of the best native breed?\r\nIf they did, it is a circumstance unparalleled in the history of\r\nagriculture. The native breed may be ameliorated by careful selection;\r\nits value may be incalculably increased; some good qualities, some of\r\nits best qualities, may be for the first time developed; but yet there\r\nwill be some resemblance to the original stock, and the more we examine\r\nthe animal the more clearly we can trace out the characteristic points\r\nof the ancestor, although every one of them is improved.”\r\n\r\nAiton remembered well the time when some short-horn or Dutch cattle, as\r\nthey were then called, were procured by some gentlemen in Scotland, and\r\nparticularly by one John Dunlop, of Cunningham, who brought some Dutch\r\ncows--doubtless short-horns--to his byres soon after the year 1760. As\r\nthey were then provided with the best of pasture, and the dairy was the\r\nchief object of the neighborhood, these cattle soon excited attention,\r\nand the small farmers began to raise up crosses from them. This was in\r\nCunningham, one of the districts of Ayrshire, and Mr. Dunlop’s were,\r\nwithout doubt, among the first of the stranger breed that reached that\r\nregion. About 1750, a little previous to the above date, the Earl of\r\nMarchmont bought of the Bishop of Durham several cows and a bull of the\r\nTeeswater breed, all of a brown color spotted with white, and kept them\r\nsome time at his seat in Berwickshire. His lordship had extensive\r\nestates in Kyle, another district of Ayrshire, and thither his factor,\r\nBruce Campbell, took some of the Teeswater breed and kept them for some\r\ntime, and their progeny spread over various parts of Ayrshire. A bull,\r\nafter serving many cows of the estates already mentioned, was sold to a\r\nMr. Hamilton, in another quarter of Ayrshire, and raised a numerous\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1767, also, John Orr sent from Glasgow to his estate in\r\nAyrshire some fine milch cows, of a much larger size than any then in\r\nthat region. One of them cost six pounds, which was more than twice the\r\nprice of the best cow in that quarter. These cows were well fed, and of\r\ncourse yielded a large return of milk; and the farmers, for miles\r\naround, were eager to get their calves to raise.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, also, a few other noblemen and gentlemen,\r\nstimulated by example, bought cattle of the same appearance, in color\r\nbrown spotted with white, all of them larger than the native cattle of\r\nthe county, and when well fed yielding much larger quantities of milk,\r\nand their calves were all raised. Bulls of their breed and color were\r\npreferred to all others.\r\n\r\nFrom the description given of these cattle, there is no doubt that they\r\nwere the old Teeswater, or Dutch; the foundation, also, according to the\r\nbest authorities, of the modern improved short-horns. With them and the\r\ncrosses obtained from them the whole county gradually became stocked,\r\nand supplied the neighboring counties, by degrees, till at present the\r\nwhole region, comprising the counties of Ayr, Renfrew, Lanark,\r\nDumbarton, and Stirling, and more than a fourth part of the whole\r\npopulation of Scotland, a large proportion of which is engaged in\r\nmanufactures and commercial or mechanical pursuits, furnishing a ready\r\nmarket for milk and butter, is almost exclusively stocked with\r\nAyrshires.\r\n\r\nThe cross with larger cattle and the natives of Ayrshire produced, for\r\nmany years, an ugly-looking beast, and the farmers were long in finding\r\nout that they had violated one of the plain principles of breeding in\r\ncoupling a large and small breed so indiscriminately together,\r\nespecially in the use of bulls proportionately larger than the cows to\r\nwhich they were put. They did not then understand that no crosses could\r\nbe made in that way to increase the size of a race, without a\r\ncorresponding increase in the feed; and many very ill-shaped animals\r\nwere the consequence of ignorance of a natural law. They made large\r\nbones, but they were never strong and vigorous in proportion to their\r\nsize. Trying to keep large animals on poor pasture produced the same\r\neffect. The results of first crosses were therefore very unsatisfactory;\r\nbut gradually better feeding and a reduction in size came to their aid,\r\nwhile in the course of years more enlightened views of farming led to\r\nhigher cultivation, and consequently to higher and better care and\r\nattention to stock. The effect of crosses with the larger Teeswater or\r\nshort-horn was not so disastrous in Ayrshire as in some of the mountain\r\nbreeds, whose feed was far less, while their exposure on high and short\r\npastures was greater.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Ayrshire is moist and mild, and the soil rich, clayey,\r\nand well adapted to pasturage, but difficult to till. The cattle are\r\nnaturally hardy and active, and capable of enduring severe winters, and\r\nof easily regaining condition with the return of spring and good feed.\r\nThe pasture-land of the county is devoted to dairy stock,--chiefly for\r\nmaking butter and cheese, a small part only being used for fattening\r\ncows when too old to keep for the dairy. The breed has undergone very\r\nmarked improvements since Aiton wrote, in 1815. The local demand for\r\nfresh dairy products has very naturally taxed the skill and judgment of\r\nthe farmers and dairy-men to the utmost, through a long course of years;\r\nand thus the remarkable milking qualities of the Ayrshires have been\r\ndeveloped to such a degree that they may be said to produce a larger\r\nquantity of rich milk and butter in proportion to the food consumed, or\r\nthe cost of production, than any other of the pure-bred races. The\r\nowners of dairies in the county of Ayr and the neighborhood were\r\ngenerally small tenants, who took charge of their stock themselves,\r\nsaving and breeding from the offspring of good milkers, and drying off\r\nand feeding such as were found to be unprofitable for milk, for the\r\nbutcher; and thus the production of milk and butter has for many years\r\nbeen the leading object with the owners of this breed, and symmetry of\r\nform and perfection of points for any other object have been very much\r\ndisregarded, or, if regarded at all, only from this one point of\r\nview--the production of the greatest quantity of rich milk.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this result has been brought about may further be\r\nseen in a remark of Aiton, who says that the Ayrshire farmers prefer\r\ntheir dairy bulls according to the feminine aspect of their heads and\r\nnecks, and wish them not round behind, but broad at the hook-bones and\r\nhips, and full in the flanks. This was more than forty years ago, and\r\nunder such circumstances, and with such care in the selection of bulls\r\nand cows with reference to one specific object, it is not surprising\r\nthat we find a breed now wholly unsurpassed when the quantity and\r\nquality of their produce is considered with reference to their\r\nproportional size and the food they consume. The Ayrshire cow has been\r\nknown to produce over ten imperial gallons of good milk a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Ayrshire Bull “ALBERT,”\r\n\r\nImported and owned by the Mass. Soc. for Promoting Agriculture.]\r\n\r\nA cow-feeder in Glasgow, selling fresh milk, is said to have realized\r\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars in seven months from one good cow; and it\r\nis stated, on high authority, that a dollar a day for six months of the\r\nyear is no uncommon income from good cows under similar circumstances,\r\nand that seventy-five cents a day is below the average. But this implies\r\nhigh and judicious feeding, of course: the average yield, on ordinary\r\nfeed, would be considerably less.\r\n\r\nYouatt estimates the daily yield of an Ayrshire cow, for the first two\r\nor three months after calving, at five gallons a day, on an average; for\r\nthe next three months, at three gallons; and for the next four months,\r\nat one gallon and a half. This would be 850 gallons as the annual\r\naverage of a cow; but allowing for some unproductive cows, he estimates\r\nthe average of a dairy at 600 gallons per annum for each cow. Three\r\ngallons and a half of the Ayrshire cow’s milk will yield one and a half\r\npounds of butter. He therefore reckons 257 pounds of butter, or 514\r\npounds of cheese, at the rate of 24 pounds to 28 gallons of milk, as the\r\nyield of every cow, at a fair and perhaps rather low average, in an\r\nAyrshire dairy, during the year. Aiton sets the yield much higher,\r\nsaying that “thousands of the best Ayrshire dairy-cows, when in prime\r\ncondition and well fed, produce 1000 gallons of milk per annum; that in\r\ngeneral three and three quarters to four gallons of their milk will\r\nyield a pound and a half of butter; and that 27¹⁄₂ gallons of their milk\r\nwill make 21 pounds of full-milk cheese.” Mr. Rankin puts it lower--at\r\nabout 650 to 700 gallons to each cow; on his own farm of inferior soil,\r\nhis dairy produced an average of 550 gallons only.\r\n\r\nOne of the four cows originally imported into this country by John P.\r\nCushing, Esq., of Massachusetts, gave in one year 3864 quarts, beer\r\nmeasure, or about 966 gallons, at ten pounds to the gallon, being an\r\naverage of over ten and a half beer quarts a day for the whole year. It\r\nis asserted, on good authority, that the first Ayrshire cow imported by\r\nthe Massachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, in 1837,\r\nyielded sixteen pounds of butter a week, for several weeks in\r\nsuccession, on grass feed only. These yields are not so large as those\r\nstated by Aiton; but it should, perhaps, be recollected that our climate\r\nis less favorable to the production of milk than that of England and\r\nScotland, and that no cow imported after arriving at maturity could be\r\nexpected to yield as much, under the same circumstances, as one bred on\r\nthe spot where the trial is made, and perfectly acclimated.\r\n\r\nIn a series of experiments on the Earl of Chesterfield’s dairy farm, at\r\nBradley Ball, interesting as giving positive data on which to form a\r\njudgment as to the yield, it was found that, in the height of the\r\nseason, the Holderness cows gave 7 gallons 1 quart per diem; the\r\nlong-horns and Alderneys, 4 gallons 3 quarts; the Devons, 4 gallons 1\r\nquart; and that, when made into butter the above quantities gave,\r\nrespectively, 38¹⁄₂ ounces, 28 ounces, and 25 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshire, a cow far smaller than the Holderness, at 5 gallons of\r\nmilk and 34 ounces of butter per day, gives a fair average as to yield\r\nof milk, and an enormous production of butter, giving within 4¹⁄₂ ounces\r\nas much from her 5 gallons as the Holderness from her 7 gallons 1 quart;\r\nher rate being nearly 7 ounces to the gallon, while that of the\r\nHolderness is considerably under 6 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of a large and practical dairyman is certainly of the\r\nhighest value; and in this connection it may be stated that Mr. Harley,\r\nthe author of the _Harleian Dairy System_, who established the\r\ncelebrated Willowbank Dairy, in Glasgow, and who kept, at times, from\r\ntwo hundred and sixty to three hundred cows, always using the utmost\r\ncare in selection, says that he had cows, by way of experiment, from\r\ndifferent parts of the united kingdom. He purchased ten at one Edinburgh\r\nmarket, of the large short-horned breed, at twenty pounds each, but\r\nthese did not give more milk, nor better in quality, than Ayrshire cows\r\nthat were bought at the same period for thirteen pounds a head; and, on\r\ncomparison, it was found that the latter were much cheaper kept, and\r\nthat they improved much more in beef and fat in proportion to their\r\nsize, than the high-priced cows. A decided preference was therefore\r\ngiven to the improved Ayrshire breed, from seven to ten years old, and\r\nfrom eight to twenty pounds a head. Prime young cows were too\r\nhigh-priced for stall feeding; old cows were generally the most\r\nprofitable in the long run, especially if they were not previously in\r\ngood keeping. The cows were generally bought when near calving, which\r\nprevented the barbarous practice called hafting, or allowing the milk to\r\nremain upon the cow for a considerable time before she is brought to the\r\nmarket. This base and cruel custom is always pernicious to the cow, and\r\nin consequence of it she seldom recovers her milk for the season. The\r\nmiddling and large sizes of cows were preferred, such as weighed from\r\nthirty-five to fifty stone, or from five hundred to eight hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Harley, the most approved shape and marks of a good\r\ndairy cow are as follows: Head small, long, and narrow towards the\r\nmuzzle; horns small, clear, bent, and placed at considerable distance\r\nfrom each other; eyes not large, but brisk and lively; neck slender and\r\nlong, tapering towards the head, with a little loose skin below;\r\nshoulders and fore quarters light and thin; hind quarters large and\r\nbroad; back straight, and joints slack and open; carcass deep in the\r\nrib; tail small and long, reaching to the heels; legs small and short,\r\nwith firm joints; udder square, but a little oblong, stretching forward,\r\nthin-skinned and capacious, but not low hung; teats or paps small,\r\npointing outwards, and at a considerable distance from each other;\r\nmilk-veins capacious and prominent; skin loose, thin, and soft like a\r\nglove; hair short, soft, and woolly; general figure, when in flesh,\r\nhandsome and well proportioned.\r\n\r\nIf this description of the Ayrshire cow be correct, it will be seen that\r\nher head and neck are remarkably clean and fine, the latter swelling\r\ngradually towards the shoulders, both parts being unincumbered with\r\nsuperfluous flesh. The same general form extends backwards, the\r\nforequarters being light, the shoulders thin, and the carcass swelling\r\nout towards the hind quarters, so that standing in front of her it has\r\nthe form of a blunted wedge. Such a structure indicates very fully\r\ndeveloped digestive organs, which exert a powerful influence on the\r\nexercise of all the functions of the body, and especially on the\r\nsecretion of the milky glands, accompanied with milk-veins and udder\r\npartaking of the same character as the stomach and viscera, being large\r\nand capacious, while the external skin and interior walls of the\r\nmilk-glands are thin and elastic, and all parts arranged in a manner\r\nespecially calculated for the production of milk.\r\n\r\nA cow with these marks will generally be of a quiet and docile temper,\r\nwhich greatly enhances her value. A cow that is of a quiet and contented\r\ndisposition feeds at ease, is milked with ease, and yields more than one\r\nof an opposite temperament; while after she is past her usefulness as a\r\nmilker she will easily take on fat, and make fine beef and a good\r\nquantity of tallow, because she feeds freely, and when dry the food\r\nwhich went to make milk is converted into fat and flesh. But there is no\r\nbreed of cows with which gentleness of treatment is so indispensable as\r\nwith the Ayrshire, on account of her naturally nervous temperament. If\r\nshe receives other than kind and gentle treatment, she will often resent\r\nit with angry looks and gestures, and withhold her milk; and if such\r\ntreatment is long continued, will dry up; but she willingly and easily\r\nyields it to the hand that fondles her, and all her looks and movements\r\ntowards her friends are quiet and mild.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the Ayrshires in their native country are generally\r\nbred for the dairy, and no other object; and the cows have obtained a\r\njust and world-wide reputation for this quality. The oxen are, however,\r\nvery fitly as working cattle, though they cannot be said to excel other\r\nbreeds in this respect. The Ayrshire steer may be fed and turned at\r\nthree years old, but for feeding purposes the Ayrshires are greatly\r\nimproved by a cross with the short-horns, provided regard is had to the\r\nsize of the animals. It is the opinion of good breeders that a high-bred\r\nshort-horn bull and a large-sized Ayrshire cow will produce a calf which\r\nwill come to maturity earlier, and attain greater weight, and sell for\r\nmore money, than a pure-bred Ayrshire. This cross, with feeding from the\r\nstart, may be sold fat at two or three years old, the improvement being\r\nespecially seen in the earlier maturity and the size. Even Youatt, who\r\nmaintains that the fattening properties of the Ayrshires have been\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, admits that they will fatten kindly and\r\nprofitably, and that their meat will be good; while he also asserts that\r\nthey unite, perhaps, to a greater degree than any other breed, the\r\nsupposed incompatible qualities of yielding a great deal of milk and\r\nbeef.\r\n\r\nIn the cross with the short-horn, the form becomes ordinarily more\r\nsymmetrical, while there is, perhaps, little risk of lessening the\r\nmilking qualities of the offspring, if sufficient regard is paid to the\r\nselection of the individual animals to breed from. It is thought by some\r\nthat in the breeding of animals it is the male which gives the external\r\nform, or the bony and muscular system of the young, while the female\r\nimparts the respiratory organs, the circulation of the blood, the mucous\r\nmembranes, the organs of secretion, &c.\r\n\r\nIf this principle is true, it follows that the milking qualities come\r\nchiefly from the mother, and that the bull can not materially alter the\r\nconditions which determine the transmission of these qualities,\r\nespecially when they are as strongly marked as they are in the Ayrshire\r\nor the Jersey races. Others, however, maintain that it is more important\r\nto the perfection of their dairy to make a good choice of bulls than of\r\nheifers, because the property of giving much milk is more surely\r\ntransmitted by the male than the female. Others still maintain that both\r\nparents are represented in the offspring, but that it is impossible to\r\nsay beforehand what parts of the derivative system are to be ascribed to\r\nthe one parent and what to the other, and that there is a blending and\r\ninterfusion of the qualities of both which prevent the body of their\r\nprogeny being mapped out into distinct regions, or divided into separate\r\nsets of organs, of which we can say, “This is from the father, that from\r\nthe mother.”\r\n\r\nTill this question is settled, it is safe, in breeding for the dairy, to\r\nadhere to the rule of selecting only animals whose progenitors on both\r\nsides have been distinguished for their milking qualities. But where the\r\nhistory of either is unknown, a resort to a well-known breed, remarkable\r\nfor its dairy qualities, is of no small importance; since, though the\r\nimmediate ancestors of a male may not be known, if he belongs to a dairy\r\nbreed, it is fair to presume that his progenitors were milkers. A study\r\nand comparison of the size and form of the milk mirror, and other\r\npoints, indicated by Guénon, on a subsequent page, are worthy of careful\r\nconsideration in selecting animals to breed from for the dairy, not only\r\namong pure-bred animals, but especially in crossing. In the scale of\r\npoints adopted in England and this country as the standard of perfection\r\nfor an Ayrshire cow, the udder, on which Guénon placed so much reliance,\r\nis valued at twelve times as much as that of the Devon, “because,” as\r\nthe judges affirm, “the Ayrshires have been bred almost exclusively with\r\nreference to their milking properties.”\r\n\r\nWe must conclude, then, that “for purely dairy purposes the Ayrshire cow\r\ndeserves the first place. In consequence of her small, symmetrical, and\r\ncompact body, combined with a well-formed chest and a capacious stomach,\r\nthere is little waste, comparatively speaking, through the respiratory\r\nsystem; while, at the same time, there is very complete assimilation of\r\nthe food, and thus she converts a large proportion of her food into\r\nmilk. So remarkable is this fact, that all dairy farmers who have any\r\nexperience on the point agree in stating _that an Ayrshire cow generally\r\ngives a larger return of milk for the food consumed than a cow of any\r\nother breed_. The absolute quantity may not be so great, but it is\r\nobtained at a less cost; and this is the point upon which the question\r\nof profit depends.”\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus at length upon this race for the reason that it is\r\npreeminently a dairy breed, surpassing all other pure breeds in the\r\nproduction of rich milk and butter on soils of medium fertility, and\r\nadmirably adapted, in my opinion, to raise the character of our stock to\r\na higher standard of excellence. The best milkers I have ever known, in\r\nthe course of my own observations, were grade Ayrshires, larger in size\r\nthan the pure bloods, but still sufficiently high grades to give certain\r\nsigns of their origin. I have owned several such, which were all good\r\ncows. This grade would seem to possess the advantage of combining, to\r\nsome extent, the two qualities of milking and adaptation to beef; and\r\nthis is no small recommendation of the stock to farmers situated as\r\nAmerican farmers are, who wish for milk for some years and then to turn\r\nover to the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JERSEY cattle have now become widely known in this country. Many of\r\nthem have been imported from an island of the same name in the British\r\nChannel, near the coast of France, and they may now be considered, I\r\nthink, as fully acclimated. They were first introduced over thirty years\r\nago, from the channel islands Alderney, Guernsey, and Jersey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Jersey Cow.[1]]\r\n\r\n  [1] See page 30.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of practical men differ widely as to the comparative merits\r\nof this race, and its adaptation to our climate and to the wants of our\r\nfarmers. The most common decision, prevailing among many even of the\r\nbest judges of stock, appears to be, that, however desirable the cows\r\nmay be on the lawn or in a gentleman’s park, they are wholly unsuited to\r\nthe general wants of the practical farmer. This may or may not be the\r\ncase. If the farmer keeps a dairy farm and sells only milk, the quantity\r\nand not the quality of which is his chief care, he can satisfy himself\r\nbetter with some other breed. If otherwise situated,--if he devotes his\r\ntime to the making of butter for the supply of customers who are\r\nwilling to pay for a good article,--he may very properly consider\r\nwhether a few Jerseys, or an infusion of Jersey blood, may not be\r\ndesirable. Haxton calls the Jersey cow the cheese and butter dairyman’s\r\nfriend when her milk is diluted with that of ten or a dozen ordinary\r\ncows, and his enemy if he should attempt to make either cheese or butter\r\nsolely from her produce, as, from the excessive richness of the milk,\r\nneither will keep long; and, finally, an ornament to the rich man’s\r\nlawn, yet in aspect altogether devoid of those rounded outlines which\r\nconstitute the criterion of animal beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Jersey race is supposed to have been derived originally from\r\nNormandy, in the northern part of France. The cows have been long\r\ncelebrated for the production of very rich milk and cream, but till\r\nwithin a quarter of a century they were comparatively coarse, ugly, and\r\nill-shaped. Improvements have been very marked, but the form of the\r\nanimal is still far from satisfying the eye. The head of the pure Jersey\r\nis fine and tapering, the cheek small, the throat clean, the muzzle fine\r\nand encircled with a light stripe, the nostril high and open; the horns\r\nsmooth, crumpled, not very thick at the base, tapering, and tipped with\r\nblack; ears small and thin, deep orange color inside; eyes full and\r\nplacid; neck straight and fine; chest broad and deep; barrel hooped,\r\nbroad and deep, well ribbed up; back straight from the withers to the\r\nhip, and from the top of the hip to the setting on of the tail; tail\r\nfine, at right angles with the back, and hanging down to the hocks; skin\r\nthin, light color and mellow, covered with fine soft hair; fore legs\r\nshort, straight and fine below the knee, arm swelling and full above;\r\nhind quarters long and well filled; hind legs short and straight below\r\nthe hocks, with bones rather fine, squarely placed, and not too close\r\ntogether; hoofs small; udder full in size, in line with the belly,\r\nextending well up behind; teats of medium size, squarely placed and wide\r\napart, and milk-veins very prominent. The color is generally cream, dun,\r\nor yellow, with more or less white, and the fine head and neck give the\r\ncows and heifers a fawn-like appearance, and make them objects of\r\nattraction in the park; but the hind quarters are often too narrow to\r\nlook well, particularly to those who judge animals from the amount of\r\nfat they carry. We should bear in mind, however, that a good race of\r\nanimals is not always the most beautiful, as that term is commonly\r\nunderstood. Beauty in stock has no fixed standard. In the estimation of\r\nsome, it results mainly from fine forms, small bones, and close, compact\r\nframes; while others consider that structure the most perfect, and\r\ntherefore the most beautiful, which is best adapted to the use to which\r\nit is destined. According to the latter, beauty is relative. It is not\r\nthe same in an animal designed for beef and in one designed fer the\r\ndairy or for work. The beauty of a milch cow is the result of her good\r\nqualities. Large milkers are very rarely cows that please the eye of any\r\nbut a skilful judge. They are generally poor, because their food goes\r\nmainly to the production of milk, and because they are selected with\r\nless regard to form than to good milking qualities. We meet with good\r\nmilkers of all forms, from the round, close-built Devon to the\r\ncoarsest-boned scrub; but, with all their varieties of form and\r\nstructure, good cows will usually possess certain points of similarity\r\nand well-known marks by which they are known to the eyes of the judge.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by Colonel Le Couteur, of the island of Jersey, that,\r\ncontrary to the general opinion here, the Jersey cow, when old and no\r\nlonger wanted as a milker, will, when dry and fed, fatten rapidly, and\r\nproduce a good quantity and excellent quality of butcher’s meat. An old\r\ncow, he says, was put up to fatten in October, 1850, weighing 1125\r\npounds, and when killed, the 6th of January, 1851, she weighed 1330\r\npounds; having gained 205 pounds in ninety-eight days, on twenty pounds\r\nof hay, a little wheat-straw, and thirty pounds of roots, consisting of\r\ncarrots, Swedes, and marigold wurzel, a day. The prevailing opinion as\r\nto the beauty of the Jersey is based on the general appearance of the\r\ncow in milk, no experiments in feeding exclusively for beef having been\r\nmade, to my knowledge, and no opportunity to form a correct judgment\r\nfrom actual observation having been furnished; and it must be confessed\r\nthat the general appearance would amply justify the hasty conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Jersey Bull.]\r\n\r\nThe bulls are usually very different in character and disposition from\r\nthe cows, and are much inclined to become restive and cross at the age\r\nof two or three years, unless their treatment is uniformly gentle and\r\nfirm. The accompanying figure very accurately represents one of the best\r\nanimals of the race in the vicinity of Boston, which has been pronounced\r\nby good judges a model of a bull for a dairy breed.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Jersey cow “Flirt,” figured on page 26, received the first\r\nprize at the Fair of the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture in\r\n1857, which brought together the largest and finest collection of Jersey\r\ncattle ever made in this country. She is well-shaped, and a very\r\nsuperior dairy cow. Her dam, Flora, was very remarkable for the richness\r\nof her milk and the quantity of her butter, having made no less than\r\nfive hundred and eleven pounds in one year, without extra feeding.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it is evident that the Jersey is to be regarded\r\nas a dairy breed, and that almost exclusively. It is evident, too, that\r\nit would not be sought for large dairies kept for the supply of milk to\r\ncities; for, though the quality would gratify the customer, the quantity\r\nwould not satisfy the owner. The place of the Jersey cow is rather in\r\nprivate establishments, where the supply of cream and butter is a\r\nsufficient object, or, in limited numbers, to add richness to the milk\r\nof large butter dairies. Even one or two good Jersey cows with a herd of\r\nfifteen or twenty, will make a great difference in the quality of the\r\nmilk and butter of the whole establishment; and they would probably be\r\nprofitable for this, if for no other object.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther breeds are somewhat noted in Great Britain for their excellent\r\ndairy qualities, and among them might be named the Yorkshire and the\r\nKerry; but they have never been introduced into this country to any\r\nextent; or, if they ever were, no traces of them as a distinct breed can\r\nnow be found here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Short-horn Cow]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT-HORNS.--No breed of horned cattle has commanded more universal\r\nadmiration during the last half-century than the improved Short-horns,\r\nwhose origin can be traced back for nearly a hundred years. According to\r\nthe best authorities, the stock which formed the basis of improvement\r\nexisted equally in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland, and counties\r\nadjoining; and the preëminence was accorded to Durham, which gave its\r\nname to the race, from the more correct principles of breeding which\r\nseem to have prevailed there.\r\n\r\nThere is a dispute among the most eminent breeders as to how far it owes\r\nits origin to early importations from Holland, whence many superior\r\nanimals were brought for the purpose of improving the old long-horned\r\nbreed. A large race of cattle had existed for many years on the western\r\nshores of the continent of Europe. At a very early date, as early as\r\n1633, they were imported from Denmark into New England in considerable\r\nnumbers, and thus laid the foundation of a valuable stock in this\r\ncountry. They extended along the coast, it is said, through Holland to\r\nFrance. The dairy formed a prominent branch of farming at a very early\r\ndate in Holland, and experience led to the greatest care in the choice\r\nand breeding of dairy stock. From these cattle many selections were made\r\nto cross over to the counties of York and Durham. The prevailing color\r\nof the large Dutch cattle was black and white, beautifully contrasted.\r\n\r\nThe cattle produced by these crosses a century ago were known under the\r\nname of “Dutch.” The cows selected for crossing with the early imported\r\nDutch bulls were generally long-horned, large-boned, coarse animals, a\r\nfair type of which was found in the old “Holderness” breed of\r\nYorkshire,--slow feeders, strong in the shoulder, defective in the fore\r\nquarter, and not very profitable for the butcher, their meat being\r\n“coarse to the palate and uninviting to the eye.” Their milking\r\nqualities were good, surpassing, probably, those of the improved\r\nshort-horns. Whatever may be the truth with regard to these crosses, and\r\nhowever far they proved effective in creating or laying the foundation\r\nof the modern improved short-horns, the results of the efforts made in\r\nYorkshire and some of the adjoining counties were never so satisfactory\r\nto the best judges as those of the breeders along the Tees, who selected\r\nanimals with greater reference to fineness of bone and symmetry of form,\r\nand the animals they bred soon took the lead, and excited great\r\nemulation in improvement.\r\n\r\nThe famous bull “Hubback,” bred by Mr. Turner, of Hurworth, and\r\nsubsequently owned by Mr. Colling, laid the foundation of the celebrity\r\nof the short-horns, and it is the pride of short-horn breeders to trace\r\nback to him. He was calved in 1777, and his descendants, Foljambe,\r\nBolingbroke, Favorite, and Comet, permanently fixed the characteristics\r\nof the breed. Comet was so highly esteemed among breeders, that he sold\r\nat one thousand guineas, or over five thousand dollars. Hubback is\r\nthought by some to have been a pure short-horn, and by others a grade or\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\nMany breeders had labored long previous to the brothers Charles and\r\nRobert Colling, especially on the old Teeswater short-horns; yet a large\r\nshare of the credit of improving and establishing the reputation of the\r\nimproved short-horns is generally accorded to the Collings. Certain it\r\nis that the spirit and discrimination with which they selected and bred\r\nsoon became known, and a general interest was awakened in the breed at\r\nthe time of the sale of Charles Colling’s herd, October 11, 1810. It was\r\nthen that Mr. Bates, of Kirkleavington, purchased the celebrated heifer\r\nDuchess I., whose family sold, in 1850, after his decease, at an average\r\nof one hundred and sixteen pounds five shillings per head, including\r\nyoung calves. Many representatives of the Duchess family, which laid the\r\nfoundation of Mr. Bates’ success as a breeder, have been brought to this\r\ncountry. They may, perhaps, be regarded as an exception to the modern\r\nimproved short-horns, their milking qualities being generally very\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nThe sale referred to, and those of R. Colling’s herd, in 1818, and that\r\nof Lord Spencer, in 1846, as well as that of the Kirkleavington herd, in\r\n1850, and especially that of the herd of Lord Ducie, two years later,\r\nare marked eras in the history of improved short-horns; and through\r\nthese sales, and the universal enthusiasm awakened by them, the\r\nshort-horns have become more widely spread ever Great Britain, and more\r\ngenerally fashionable, than any other breed. They have also been\r\nlargely introduced into France by the government, for the improvement\r\nof the various French breeds by crossing, and into nearly every quarter\r\nof the civilized world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Short-horn Bull “DOUBLE DUKE,” (1451¹⁄₂ Am. H.\r\nBook,)\r\n\r\nOwned by Harvest Club, Springfield.]\r\n\r\nImportations have been frequent and extensive into the United States\r\nwithin the last few years, and this famous breed is now pretty generally\r\ndiffused over the country.\r\n\r\nThe use of the early-imported short-horn bulls and native cows led to\r\nthe formation of many families of grades, some of them bred back to the\r\nsire, and others crossed high up, which have attained a very\r\nconsiderable local reputation in many sections. As instances of this,\r\nmay be mentioned the Creampot stock, obtained by Col. Jaques from a\r\nshort-horn bull, Cœlebs, and a superior native cow. A family of fine\r\nmilkers still exists in Massachusetts, known by the name of the “Sukey\r\nbreed,” supposed to have been derived from “Denton,” a very superior\r\nanimal imported by Mr. Williams, of Northboro’, some forty years ago.\r\nMany of the best milkers of that section can be traced back to him. The\r\nPatton stock, originally imported into Maryland and Virginia, in 1783,\r\nand thence to Kentucky, may be classed in the same category. A part of\r\nthese were at first known as the “milk breed,” and others as the “beef\r\nbreed:” the first short-horns, at that time good milkers, and the latter\r\nlong-horns, of large size and coarse in the bone. In Kentucky they were\r\nall known as the Patton stock.\r\n\r\nThe high-bred short-horn is easily prepared for a show, and, as fat will\r\ncover faults, the temptation is often too great to be resisted; and\r\nhence it is common to see the finest animals rendered unfit for breeding\r\npurposes by over-feeding. The race is susceptible of breeding for the\r\nproduction of milk, as several families show, and great milkers have\r\noften been known among pure-bred animals; but it is more common to find\r\nit bred mainly for the butcher, and kept accordingly. It is, however, a\r\nwell-known fact that the dairies of London are stocked chiefly with\r\nshort-horns and Yorkshires, or high grades between them, which, after\r\nbeing milked as long as profitable, feed equal, or nearly so, to\r\npure-bred short-horns.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, by very high authority, that “the short-horns improve\r\nevery breed they cross with.”\r\n\r\nThe desirable characteristics of the short-horn bull may be summed up,\r\naccording to the judgment of the best breeders, as follows: He should\r\nhave a short but fine head, very broad across the eyes, tapering to the\r\nnose, with a nostril full and prominent; the nose itself should be of a\r\nrich flesh-color; eyes bright and mild; ears somewhat large and thin;\r\nhorns slightly curved and rather flat, well set on a long, broad,\r\nmuscular neck; chest wide, deep, and projecting; shoulders fine,\r\noblique, well formed into the chine; fore legs short, with upper arm\r\nlarge and powerful; barrel round, deep, well ribbed home; hips wide and\r\nlevel; back straight from the withers to the setting on of the tail, but\r\nshort from hip to chine; skin soft and velvety to the touch; moderately\r\nthick hair, plentiful, soft, and mossy. The cow has the same points in\r\nthe main, but her head is finer, longer, and more tapering, neck thinner\r\nand lighter, and shoulders more narrow across the chine.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing precocity of the short-horns, their remarkable aptitude\r\nto fatten, the perfection of their forms, and the fineness of their bony\r\nstructure, give them an advantage over most other races when the object\r\nof breeding is for the shambles. No animal of any other breed can so\r\nrapidly transform the stock of any section around him as the improved\r\nshort-horn bull.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that the high-bred short-horns are\r\nunexceptionable even for beef. The very exaggeration, so to speak, of\r\nthe qualities which make them so valuable for the improvement of other\r\nand less perfect races, may become a fault when wanted for the table.\r\nThe very rapidity with which they increase in size is thought by some to\r\nprevent their meat from ripening up sufficiently before being hurried\r\noff to the butcher. The disproportion of the fatty to the muscular\r\nflesh, found in this to a greater extent than in races coming slower to\r\nmaturity, makes the meat of the thorough-bred short-horn, in the\r\nestimation of some, both less agreeable to the taste and less profitable\r\nto the consumer, since the nitrogenous compounds, true sources of\r\nnutriment, are found in less quantity than in the meat of animals not so\r\nhighly bred.\r\n\r\nBut the improved short-horn is justly unrivalled for symmetry of form\r\nand beauty. I have never seen a picture or an engraving of an animal\r\nwhich gave an adequate idea of the beauty of many specimens of this\r\nrace, especially of the best bred in Kentucky and Ohio, where many\r\nexcellent breeders, favored by a climate and pastures eminently adapted\r\nto bring the short-horn to perfection, have not only imported\r\nextensively from the best herds in England, but have themselves attained\r\na degree of knowledge and skill equalled only by that of the most\r\ncelebrated breeders in the native country of this improved race.\r\n\r\nIn sections where the climate is moist and the food abundant and rich,\r\nsome families of the short-horns may be valuable for the dairy; but they\r\nare most frequently bred exclusively for beef in this country, and in\r\nsections where they have attained the highest perfection of form and\r\nbeauty so little is thought of their milking qualities that they are\r\noften not milked at all, the calf being allowed to run with the dam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Imported Dutch Cow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUTCH is a short-horned race of cattle, which, in the opinion of\r\nmany, as I have already remarked, contributed largely, about a century\r\nago, to build up the Durham or Teeswater stock. It has been bred with\r\nspecial reference to dairy qualities, and is eminently adapted to supply\r\nthe wants of the dairy farmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Imported Dutch Bull.]\r\n\r\nThe cow, Fig. 7, was bred in North Holland, and imported by Winthrop W.\r\nChenery, Esq., of Watertown, in 1857. The bull, Fig. 8, was also\r\nimported by Mr. Chenery at the same time, from near the Beemster, in the\r\nnortherly part of Purmerend. Both animals are truthfully delineated, and\r\ngive a correct idea of the points of the North Dutch cattle. For a more\r\ndetailed description of this celebrated dairy race, see pages 51 and\r\n301.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Hereford Cow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEREFORDS.--The Hereford cattle derive their name from a county in the\r\nwestern part of England. Their general characteristics are a white face,\r\nsometimes mottled; white throat, the white generally extending back on\r\nthe neck, and sometimes, though rarely, still further along on the back.\r\nThe color of the rest of the body is red, generally dark, but sometimes\r\nlight. Eighty years ago the best Hereford cattle were mottled or roan\r\nall over; and some of the best herds, down to a comparatively recent\r\nperiod, were either all mottled, or had the mottled or speckled face.\r\nThe expression of the face is mild and lively; the forehead open, broad,\r\nand large; the eyes bright and full of vivacity; the horns glossy,\r\nslender, and spreading; the head small, though larger and not quite so\r\nclean as that of the Devons; the lower jaw fine; neck long and slender;\r\nchest deep; breast-bone large, prominent, and very muscular; the\r\nshoulder-blade light; shoulder full and soft; brisket and loins large;\r\nhips well developed, and on a level with the chine; hind quarters long\r\nand well filled in; buttocks on a level with the back, neither falling\r\noff nor raised above the hind quarters; tail slender, well set on; hair\r\nfine and soft; body round and full; carcass deep and well formed, or\r\ncylindrical; bone small; thigh short and well made; legs short and\r\nstraight, and slender below the knee; as handlers very excellent,\r\nespecially mellow to the touch on the back, the shoulder, and along the\r\nsides, the skin being soft, flexible, of medium thickness, rolling on\r\nthe neck and the hips; hair bright; face almost bare, which is\r\ncharacteristic of pure-bred Herefords. They belong to the middle-horned\r\ndivision of the cattle of Great Britain, to which they are indigenous.\r\nThey have been improved within the last century by careful selections,\r\nthe first step to this end having been taken by Benjamin Tomkins, of\r\nHerefordshire, who began about 1766, with two cows possessing a\r\nremarkable tendency to take on fat. One of these was gray, and the other\r\ndark red, with a mottled or spotted face.\r\n\r\nTaking these as a foundation, Mr. Tomkins went on to build up a large\r\nherd, from which he sold to other breeders, from time to time, till at\r\nhis decease, in 1819, the whole herd was disposed of at\r\nauction--fifty-two animals, including twenty-two steers and two heifers,\r\nvarying in age from calves to two-year-olds, bringing an aggregate of\r\nfour thousand six hundred and seventy-three pounds, fourteen shillings,\r\nor four hundred and forty-five dollars, thirty-seven and a half cents, a\r\nhead. A bull was sold to Lord Talbot for five hundred and eighty-eight\r\npounds, while several cows brought from a thousand to twelve hundred\r\ndollars a head.\r\n\r\nHereford oxen are excellent animals, less active but stronger than the\r\nDevons, and very free and docile. The demand for Herefords for beef\r\nprevents their being much used for work in their native county, and the\r\nfarmers there generally use horses instead of oxen. A recent writer in\r\nthe _Farmer’s Magazine_ makes the following remarks on this head: “It is\r\nallowed on all hands, I believe, that the properties in which Herefords\r\nstand preëminent among the middle-sized breeds are in the production of\r\noxen and their superiority of flesh. On these points there is little\r\nchance of their being excelled. It should, however, be borne in mind\r\nthat the best oxen are not produced from the largest cows; nor is a\r\nsuperior quality of flesh, such as is considered very soft to the touch,\r\nwith thin skin. It is the union of these two qualities which often\r\ncharacterizes the short-horns; but the Hereford breeders should endeavor\r\nto maintain a higher standard of excellence,--that for which the best of\r\nthe breed have always been esteemed,--a moderately thick, mellow hide,\r\nwith a well-apportioned combination of softness with elasticity. A\r\nsufficiency of hair is also desirable, and if accompanied with a\r\ndisposition to curl moderately it is more in esteem: but that which has\r\na harsh and wiry feel is objectionable.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Hereford Bull.]\r\n\r\nIn point of symmetry and beauty of form, the well-bred Herefords may be\r\nclassed with the improved short-horns, though they arrive somewhat\r\nslower at maturity, and never attain such weight. Like the improved\r\nshort-horns, they are chiefly bred for beef, and their beef is of the\r\nbest quality in the English markets, commanding the highest price of\r\nany, except, perhaps, the West Highlanders.\r\n\r\nIn an experiment carefully tried in 1828, for the purpose of arriving at\r\nthe comparative economy of the short-horns and Herefords, the latter\r\ngained less by nearly one fourth than the former, which had consumed\r\nmore food. The six animals, three of each breed, were sold after being\r\nfed, in Smithfield market, the Herefords bringing less by only about\r\nfive dollars than the short-horns, while the cost of food consumed by\r\nthe latter was greater, and the original purchase greater than that of\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe short-horn produces more beef at the same age than the Hereford, but\r\nconsumes more food in proportion. “In all the fairs of England,” says\r\nHillyard, “except those of Herefordshire and the adjoining counties,\r\nshort-horn heifers are more sought after and sell at higher prices than\r\nthe Hereford; but it is not so with fat cattle, for, with the exception\r\nof Lincolnshire and some of the northern counties, they much prefer the\r\nHerefords. Then at Smithfield, where the quality of the beef passes its\r\nfinal judgment, the pound of Hereford beef pays better than the pound of\r\nshort-horn beef. Short-horn beeves produce at the same age a greater\r\nweight, it is true, but they also consume more food. I can easily\r\nconceive why, in the magnificent pastures of Lincolnshire, and some of\r\nthe northern counties of England, they may prefer the short-horns; and\r\nthat is, that they may keep a less number on a given quantity of land,\r\nand only the short-horn could, under these conditions, produce a greater\r\nweight of beef per acre. It is very difficult to decide which of the two\r\nraces in England (the two best in the world) is the most profitable for\r\nstock-raisers and for the community.” There are, even in Lincolnshire,\r\nmany good feeders who prefer the Herefords to the short-horns. One of\r\nthese, when visited the past season, had thirty head of cattle feeding\r\nfor the butcher, and only one short-horn. When asked the reason of this,\r\nhe replied, “I am a farmer myself, and have to pay high rent, and I must\r\nfeed the cattle that pay me best. Perhaps you think it would be more in\r\nfashion to cover my fields with short-horns; but I must look to the net\r\nprofit, and I get much better with the Herefords. The short-horns are\r\ntoo full of fat and make too little tallow, and they consequently sell\r\ntoo low in the Smithfield market. Our Herefords are better, and they\r\nsell better.”\r\n\r\nThe Herefords are far less generally spread over England than the\r\nimproved short-horns. They have seldom been bred for milk, as some\r\nfamilies of the short-horns have; and it is not very unusual to find\r\npure-bred cows incapable of supplying milk sufficient to nourish their\r\ncalves. This system was pursued especially by Mr. Price, a skilful\r\nHereford breeder, who sacrified everything to form, disregarding milking\r\nproperties, breeding often from near relations, and thus fixing the\r\nfault incident to his system more or less permanently in the descendants\r\nof his stock.\r\n\r\nThe Herefords have been brought to this country, to some extent, and\r\nseveral fine herds exist in different sections; the earliest\r\nimportations being those of Henry Clay, of Kentucky, in 1817. The\r\nfigures of the two animals of this breed presented in this connection\r\nrepresent a bull and cow bred at the State Farm, in Massachusetts, and\r\nare good specimens of the breed.\r\n\r\nThe want of care and attention to the udder, soon after calving,\r\nespecially if the cow be on luxuriant grass, often injures her milking\r\nproperties exceedingly. The practice in the county of Hereford has\r\ngenerally been to let the calves suckle from four to six months, and\r\nbull-calves often run eight months with the cow. But their dairy\r\nqualities are perhaps as good as those of any cattle whose fattening\r\nproperties have been so carefully developed; and, though it is probable\r\nthat they could be bred for milk by proper care and attention, yet, as\r\nthis change would be at the sacrifice of other qualities equally\r\nvaluable, it would evidently be wiser to resort to other stock for the\r\ndairy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 11. Devon Cow.\r\n\r\nOwned by William Buckminster Esq., Framingham Mass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH DEVONS.--The last of the pure-bred races which it will be\r\nnecessary to describe as prominent among our American cattle is the\r\nDevon, a middle-horned breed, now very generally distributed in some\r\nsections of the country.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful race of cattle dates further back than any\r\nwell-established breed among us. It goes generally under the simple name\r\nof Devon; but the cattle of the southern part of the county, from which\r\nthe race derives its name, differ somewhat from those of the northern,\r\nhaving a larger and coarser frame, and far less tendency to fatten,\r\nthough their dairy qualities are superior.\r\n\r\nThe North Devons are remarkable for hardihood, symmetry, and beauty, and\r\nare generally bred for work and for beef rather than for the dairy. The\r\nhead is fine and well set on; the horns of medium length, generally\r\ncurved; color usually bright blood-red, but sometimes inclining to\r\nyellow; skin thin and orange-yellow; hair of medium length, soft and\r\nsilky, making the animals remarkable as handlers; muzzle of the nose\r\nwhite; eyes full and mild; ears yellowish, or orange color inside, of\r\nmoderate size; neck rather long, with little dewlap; shoulders oblique;\r\nlegs small and straight, and feet in proportion; chest of good width;\r\nribs round and expanded; loins of first-rate quality, long, wide, and\r\nfleshy; hips round, of medium width; rump level; tail full near the\r\nsetting on, tapering to the tip; thighs of the bull and ox muscular and\r\nfull, and high in the flank, though in the cow sometimes thought to be\r\ntoo light; the size medium, generally called small. The proportion of\r\nmeat on the valuable parts is greater, and the offal less, than on most\r\nother breeds, while it is well settled that they consume less food in\r\nits production. The Devons are popular with the Smithfield butchers, and\r\ntheir beef is well marbled or grained.\r\n\r\nAs working oxen, the Devons perhaps excel all other races in quickness,\r\ndocility, and beauty, and the ease with which they are matched. With a\r\nreasonable load, they are said to be equal to horses as walkers on the\r\nroad, and when they are no longer wanted for work they fatten easily and\r\nturn well.\r\n\r\nAs milkers, they do not excel, perhaps they may be said not to equal,\r\nthe other breeds, and they have a reputation of being decidedly below\r\nthe average. In their native country the general average of a dairy is\r\none pound of butter per day during the summer.\r\n\r\nThey are bred for beef and for work, and not for the dairy; and their\r\nyield of milk is small, though of a rich quality. I have, however, had\r\noccasion to examine several animals from the celebrated Patterson herd,\r\nwhich would have been remarkable as milkers even among good milking\r\nstock. They had not, to be sure, the beautiful symmetry of form and\r\nfineness of bone which characterize most of the modern and highly\r\nimproved pure-bred North Devons, and had evidently been bred for many\r\nyears with special reference to the development of the milking\r\nqualities, great care having been taken to use bulls and cows as\r\nbreeders from the best milking stock, rather than of the finest forms.\r\nThe use of bulls distinguished only for symmetry of form, and of a race\r\ndeficient in milk-secreting qualities, will be sure to deteriorate,\r\ninstead of improving, the stock for the dairy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Devon Bull.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, whatever may be our judgment of this breed, the faults of\r\nthe North Devon cow can hardly be overlooked from our present point of\r\nview. The rotundity of form and compactness of frame, though they\r\ncontribute to her remarkable beauty, constitute an objection to her as\r\na dairy cow, since it is generally thought that the peculiarity of form\r\nwhich disposes an animal to take on fat is somewhat incompatible with\r\ngood milking qualities, and hence Youatt says: “For the dairy the North\r\nDevons must be acknowledged to be inferior to several other breeds. The\r\nmilk is good, and yields more than the average proportion of cream and\r\nbutter; but it is deficient in quantity.” He also maintains that its\r\nproperty as a milker could not be improved without probable or certain\r\ndetriment to its grazing qualities.\r\n\r\nBut the fairest test of its fitness for the dairy is to be found in the\r\nestimation in which distinguished Devon breeders themselves have held it\r\nin this respect. A scale of points of excellence in this breed was\r\nestablished, some time ago, by the best judges in England; and it has\r\nsince been adopted, with but slight changes, in this country. These\r\njudges, naturally prejudiced in favor of the breed, if prejudiced at\r\nall, made this scale to embrace one hundred points, no animal to be\r\nregarded as perfect unless it excelled in all of them. Each part of the\r\nbody was assigned its real value in the scale: a faultless head, for\r\ninstance, was estimated at four; a deep, round chest, at fifteen, &c. If\r\nthe animal was defective in any part, the number of points which\r\nrepresented the value of that part in the scale was to be deducted pro\r\nrata from the hundred, in determining its merits. But in this scale the\r\ncow is so lightly esteemed for the dairy, that the udder, the size and\r\nshape of which is of the utmost consequence in determining the capacity\r\nof the milch cow, is set down as worth only _one point_, while, in the\r\nsame scale, the horns and ears are valued at two points each, and the\r\ncolor of the nose, and the expression of the eye, are valued at four\r\npoints each. Supposing, therefore, that each of these points were\r\nvalued at one dollar, and a perfect North Devon cow was valued at one\r\nhundred dollars; then another cow of the same blood, and equal to the\r\nfirst in every respect except in her udder, which is such as to make it\r\ncertain that she can never be capable of giving milk enough to nourish\r\nher calf, must be worth, according to the estimation of the best Devon\r\nbreeders, ninety-nine dollars! It is safe, therefore, to say that an\r\nanimal whose udder and lacteal glands are regarded, by those who best\r\nknow her capacities and her merits, as of only one quarter part as much\r\nconsequence as the color of her nose, or half as much as the shape and\r\nsize of her horns, cannot be recommended for the dairy. The improved\r\nNorth Devon cow may be classed, in this respect, with the Hereford,\r\nneither of which has well-developed milk-vessels--a point of the utmost\r\nconsequence to the practical dairyman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe list of pure-bred races in America may be said to end here; for,\r\nthough other and well-established breeds, like the long-horns, the\r\nGalloways, the Spanish, &c., have, at times, been imported, and have had\r\nsome influence on our American stock, they have not been kept distinct\r\nto such an extent as to have become the prevailing stock of any\r\nparticular section, so far as I am aware, and hence a notice of them\r\nproperly comes in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GRADE OF NATIVE CATTLE.--THE PRINCIPLES OF BREEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt thus far mainly upon the prominent breeds of cattle known\r\namong us, and especially those adapted to the dairy. But a large\r\nproportion--by far the largest proportion, indeed--cannot be included\r\nunder any of the races alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe term breed, properly understood, applies only to animals of the same\r\nspecies, possessing, besides the general characteristics of that\r\nspecies, other characteristics peculiar to themselves, which they owe to\r\nthe influence of soil, climate, nourishment, and habits of life to which\r\nthey are subjected, and which they transmit with certainty to their\r\nprogeny. The characteristics of certain breeds or families are so well\r\nmarked, that if an individual supposed to belong to any one of them were\r\nto produce an offspring not possessing them, or possessing them only in\r\npart, with others not belonging to the breed, it would be just ground\r\nfor suspecting a want of purity of blood.\r\n\r\nIf this definition of the term breed be correct, no grade animals, and\r\nno animals not possessing fixed peculiarities or characteristics which\r\nthey share with all other animals of the class of which they are a type,\r\nand which they are capable of transmitting with certainty to their\r\ndescendants, can be recognized by breeders as belonging to any one\r\ndistinct race, breed, or family.\r\n\r\nThe term “native,” or “scrub,” is applied to a vast majority of our\r\nAmerican cattle, which, though born on the soil, and thus in one sense\r\nnatives, do not constitute a breed, race, or family, as properly\r\nunderstood by breeders. They do not possess characteristics peculiar to\r\nthem all, which they transmit with any certainty to their offspring,\r\neither of form, size, color, milking or working properties. But, though\r\nan animal may be made up of a mixture of blood almost to infinity, it\r\ndoes not follow that for specific purposes, it may not, as an individual\r\nanimal, be one of the best of the species. And for particular purposes\r\nindividual animals might be selected from among those commonly called\r\nnatives in New England, and scrubs at the West and South, equal, and\r\nperhaps superior, to any among the races produced by the most skilful\r\nbreeding. There can be no impropriety in the use of the term “native,”\r\ntherefore, when it is understood as descriptive of no known breed, but\r\nonly as applied to the common stock of the country, which does not\r\nconstitute a breed. But perhaps the whole class of animals commonly\r\ncalled “natives” would be better described as grades, since they are\r\nwell known to have sprung from a great variety of cattle procured in\r\ndifferent places and at different times on the continent of Europe, in\r\nEngland, and in the Spanish West Indies, brought together without any\r\nregard to fixed principles of breeding, but only from individual\r\nconvenience, and by accident.\r\n\r\nThe first importations to this country were doubtless those taken to\r\nVirginia previous to 1609, though the exact date of their arrival is not\r\nknown. Several cows were carried there from the West Indies in 1610, and\r\nthe next year no less than one hundred arrived there from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe earliest cattle imported into the Plymouth colony, and undoubtedly\r\nthe earliest introduced into New England, arrived in 1624. At the\r\ndivision of cattle which took place in 1627, three years after, one or\r\ntwo are distinctly described as black, or black and white, others as\r\nbrindle, showing that there was no uniformity of color. Soon after this,\r\na large number of cattle were brought over from England for the settlers\r\nat Salem. These importations formed the original stock of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1625 the first importation was made into New York from Holland, by\r\nthe Dutch West India Company, and the foundation was then laid for an\r\nexceedingly valuable race of animals, which subsequent importations from\r\nthe same country, as well as from England, have greatly improved.\r\n\r\nDairy farming in some parts of Holland, it may be remarked in passing,\r\nbecame a highly important branch of industry at a very early date, and a\r\nlarge and valuable race of dairy cattle existed there long before the\r\nefforts of modern breeders began in England. The attention of farmers\r\nthere is at the present time devoted especially to the dairy, and the\r\nmanufacture of butter and cheese. They support themselves, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, upon this branch of farming; and hence it is held\r\nin the highest respect, and carried to a greater degree of exactness and\r\nperfection, perhaps, than in any other part of the world. They are\r\nespecially particular in the breeding, keeping, and care of milch cows,\r\nas on them very much of their success depends. The principles on which\r\nthey practise, in selecting a cow to breed from, are as follows: She\r\nshould have, they say, considerable size--not less than four and a half\r\nor five feet girth, with a length of body corresponding; legs\r\nproportionally short; a finely-formed head, with a forehead or face\r\nsomewhat concave; clear, large, mild, and sparkling eyes, yet with no\r\nexpression of wildness; tolerably large and stout ears, standing out\r\nfrom the head; fine, well-curved horns; a rather short than long, thick,\r\nbroad neck, well set against the chest and withers; the front part of\r\nthe breast and the shoulders must be broad and fleshy; the low-hanging\r\ndewlap must be soft to the touch; the back and loins must be properly\r\nprojected, somewhat broad, the bones not too sharp, but well covered\r\nwith flesh; the animal should have long, curved ribs, which form a broad\r\nbreast-bone; the body must be round and deep, but not sunken into a\r\nhanging belly; the rump must not be uneven, the hip-bones should not\r\nstand out too broad and spreading, but all the parts should be level and\r\nwell filled up; a fine tail, set moderately high up and tolerably long,\r\nbut slender, with a thick, bushy tuft of hair at the end, hanging down\r\nbelow the hocks; the legs must be short and low, but strong in the bony\r\nstructure; the knees broad, with flexible joints; the muscles and sinews\r\nmust be firm and sound, the hoofs broad and flat, and the position of\r\nthe legs natural, not too close and crowded; the hide, covered with fine\r\nglossy hair, must be soft and mellow to the touch, and set loose upon\r\nthe body. A large, rather long, white and loose udder, extending well\r\nback, with four long teats, serves also as a characteristic mark of a\r\ngood milch cow. Large and prominent milk-veins must extend from the\r\nnavel back to the udder; the belly of a good milch cow should not be too\r\ndeep and hanging. The color of the North Dutch cattle is mostly\r\nvariegated. Cows with only one color are no favorites. Red or black\r\nvariegated, gray and blue variegated, roan, spotted and white variegated\r\ncows, are especially liked.\r\n\r\nThe annexed cut gives a correct idea of the cow most esteemed in\r\nHolland; the type of the race so noted for the production of milk, and\r\nof the excellent round Dutch cheeses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Dutch Dairy Cow.]\r\n\r\nIn 1627, cattle were brought from Sweden to the settlements on the\r\nDelaware by the Swedish West India Company. In 1631, 1632, and 1633,\r\nseveral importations were made into New Hampshire by Capt. John Mason,\r\nwho, with Gorges, procured the patent of large tracts of land in the\r\nvicinity of Piscataqua River, and immediately formed settlements there.\r\nThe object of Mason was to carry on the manufacture of potash. For this\r\npurpose he employed the Danes; and it was in his voyages to and from\r\nDenmark that he procured many Danish cattle and horses, which were\r\nsubsequently diffused over that whole region, and large numbers of which\r\nwere driven to the vicinity of Boston and sold. These facts are\r\nauthenticated by original documents and depositions now on file in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State of New Hampshire. The Danish cattle are\r\nthere described as large and coarse, of a yellow color; and it is\r\nsupposed that they were procured by Mason as being best capable of\r\nenduring the severity of the climate and the hardships to which they\r\nwere to be subjected. However this may have been, they very soon spread\r\namong the colonists of the Massachusetts Bay, and have undoubtedly left\r\ntheir marks on the stock of New England and the Middle States, which\r\nexist to some extent even to the present day, mixed in with an infinite\r\nmultitude of crosses with the Devons, the Dutch cattle already alluded\r\nto, the black cattle of Spain and Wales, and the long-horn and the\r\nshort-horn, most of which crosses were accidental, or due to local\r\ncircumstances or individual convenience. Many of these cattle, the\r\ndescendants of such crosses, are of a very high order of merit, but to\r\nwhat particular cross it is due it is impossible to say. They make\r\ngenerally hardy, strong, and docile oxen, easily broken to the yoke and\r\nquick to work, with a fair tendency to fatten when well fed; while the\r\ncows, though often ill-shaped, are sometimes remarkably good milkers,\r\nespecially as regards the quantity they give.\r\n\r\nI have very often heard the best judges of stock say that if they\r\ndesired to select a dairy of cows for milk for sale, they would go\r\naround and select cows commonly called native, rather than resort to\r\npure-bred animals of any of the established breeds, and that they\r\nbelieved they should find such a dairy the most profitable.\r\n\r\nIn color, the natives, made up as already indicated, are exceedingly\r\nvarious. The old Denmarks, which to a considerable extent laid the\r\nfoundation of the stock of Maine and New Hampshire, were light yellow.\r\nThe Dutch of New York and the Middle States were black and white; the\r\nSpanish and Welsh were generally black; the Devons, which are supposed\r\nto have laid the foundation of the stock of some of the states, were\r\nred. Crosses of the Denmark with the Spanish and Welsh naturally made a\r\ndark brindle. Crosses of the Denmark and Devon often made a lighter or\r\nyellowish brindle, while the more recent importations of Jerseys and\r\nshort-horns have generally produced a beautiful spotted progeny. The\r\ndeep red has long been a favorite color in New England; but the\r\nprejudice in its favor is fast giving way to more variegated colors.\r\n\r\nBut, though we have already an exceedingly valuable foundation for\r\nimprovement, no one will pretend to deny that our cattle, as a whole,\r\nare susceptible of it in many respects. They possess neither the size,\r\nthe symmetry, nor the early maturity, of the short-horns; they do not,\r\nas a general thing, possess the fineness of bone, the beauty of form and\r\ncolor, nor the activity, of the Devons or the Herefords; they do not\r\npossess that uniform richness of milk, united with generous quantity, of\r\nthe Ayrshires, nor the surpassing richness of milk of the Jerseys; but,\r\nabove all, they do not possess the power of transmitting the many good\r\nqualities which they often have to their offspring, which is a\r\ncharacteristic of all well-established breeds.\r\n\r\nEqually certain is it, in the opinion of many good judges, that the\r\ndairy stock of New England has not been improved in its intrinsic good\r\nqualities during the last thirty or forty years. Cows of the very\r\nhighest order as milkers were as frequently met with, they say, in 1825,\r\nas at the present time. Any increased product of our dairies they\r\nascribe to improved care and feeding, rather than to improvement in the\r\ndairy qualities of the stock.\r\n\r\nThis may not be true of some other sections of the country, where the\r\ndairy has been a more special object of pursuit, and where the custom of\r\nraising the best male calves of the neighborhood, or those that came\r\nfrom the best dairy cows, and then of using only the best-formed bulls,\r\nhas long prevailed. In this way some progress has, doubtless, been made.\r\n\r\nThere is an old adage among the dairy farmers of Ayrshire, that “The cow\r\ngives her milk by the mou’,” which was slightly varied from an old\r\nGerman proverb, that “_The cow milks only through the throat_.” It is\r\nfortunate, indeed, that wiser and more humane ideas prevail with regard\r\nto the care of stock of all kinds; for it is well known that the\r\ntreatment the stock of the country received for the first two centuries\r\nafter its settlement was often barbarous and cruel in the extreme, and\r\nthat thousands perished, in the early history of the colonies, from\r\nexposure and starvation. Even within my own distinct recollection, it\r\nwas thought, for miles around my native place, that cows and young stock\r\nshould remain out of doors exposed to the cold winter days, to\r\n“toughen;” and that, too, by men who styled themselves “practical”\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Colman truly asserted, in 1841, that the general treatment of\r\ncows in New England would not be an inapt subject of presentment by a\r\ngrand jury. There were, at that time, it is true, many honorable\r\nexceptions; but the assertion was strictly correct so far as it applied\r\nto the section of which I then had a personal knowledge. Judging from\r\nthe anxiety manifested by those who enter superior milch cows for the\r\npremiums offered by agricultural societies to show that they have had\r\nnothing, or next to nothing, to eat, it is evident that the false ideas\r\nwith regard to the feeding and treatment of this animal have not yet\r\nwholly disappeared. But, if little improvement has been made in our\r\ndairy stock except that produced by more liberal feeding, it simply\r\nshows that our efforts have not been made in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe raising of cattle has now become a source of profit in many\r\nsections to a greater extent, at least, than formerly, and it becomes a\r\nmatter of great practical importance to our farmers to take the proper\r\nsteps to improve them. Indeed, the questions, what is the best breed,\r\nand what are the best crosses, and how shall I improve my stock, are now\r\nalmost daily asked; and their practical solution would add many thousand\r\ndollars to the aggregate wealth of the farmers of the country, if they\r\nwould all study their own interests. The time is gradually passing away\r\nwhen the intelligent practical farmer will be willing to put his cows to\r\nany mere “runt” of a bull, simply because his service may be had for\r\ntwenty-five cents; for, even if the progeny is to go to the butcher, the\r\ncalf sired by a pure-bred bull, particularly of a race distinguished for\r\nfineness of bone, symmetry of form, and early maturity, will bring a\r\nmuch higher price at the same age than the calf sired by a scrub. Blood\r\nhas a money value, which will, sooner or later, be generally\r\nappreciated. The first and most important object of the farmer is to get\r\nthe greatest money-return for his labor and his produce; and it is for\r\nhis interest to obtain an animal--a calf, for instance--that will yield\r\nthe largest profit on the outlay. If a calf, for which the original\r\noutlay was five dollars, will bring at the same age, and on the same\r\nkeep, more real net profit than another, the original outlay for which\r\nwas but twenty-five cents, it is certainly for the farmer’s interest to\r\npay the larger original outlay, and have the superior animal. Setting\r\nall fancy aside, it is merely a question of dollars and cents; but one\r\nthing is certain, and that is, that the farmer cannot afford to keep\r\npoor stock. It eats as much, and requires nearly the same amount of care\r\nand attention, as stock of the best quality; while it is equally certain\r\nthat stock of ever so good a quality, whether grade, “native,” or\r\nthorough-bred, will be sure to deteriorate and sink to the level of poor\r\nstock, by neglect and want of proper attention.\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to improve our stock? Not, surely, by that\r\nindiscriminate crossing, with a total disregard to all well-established\r\nprinciples, which has thus far marked our efforts generally with foreign\r\nstock, and which is one prominent reason why so little improvement has\r\nbeen made in our dairies; nor by leaving all the results to chance,\r\nwhen, by a careful and judicious selection, they may be within our own\r\ncontrol. Two modes of improvement seem to suggest themselves to the mind\r\nof the breeder, either of which, apparently, promises good results. The\r\nfirst is, to select from among our native cattle the most perfect\r\nanimals not known or suspected to be related to any of the\r\nwell-established breeds, and to use them as breeders. This is a mode of\r\nimprovement simple enough, if adopted and carried on with animals of any\r\nknown breed; and, indeed, it is the only mode of improvement which\r\npreserves the purity of blood; but, to do it successfully, requires\r\ngreat experience, a good and sure eye for stock, a mind free from\r\nprejudice, and indefatigable patience and perseverance. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary, also, to pay special attention to the calves thus produced;\r\nto furnish them at all times, summer and winter, with an abundant supply\r\nof nutritious food, and to regulate it according to their growth. Few\r\nmen are to be found willing to undertake the herculean task of building\r\nup a new breed in this way from grade stock. An objection meets us at\r\nthe very outset, which is that it would require a long series of years\r\nto arrive at any satisfactory results, from the fact that no two\r\nanimals, made up, as our “native” cattle are, of such a variety of\r\nelements and crosses, could be found sufficiently alike to produce their\r\nkind. The principle that like produces like may be perfectly true, and\r\nin the well-known breeds it is not difficult to find two animals that\r\nwill be sure to transmit their own characteristics to their offspring;\r\nbut, with two animals which cannot be classed with any breed, the\r\ndefects of an ill-bred ancestry will be liable to appear through several\r\ngenerations, and thus thwart and disappoint the expectations of the\r\nbreeder. The objection of time, and expense, and disappointment,\r\nattending this method, should have no weight, if there were no more\r\nspeedy method of accomplishing equally desirable results.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is somewhat more feasible; and that is, to select\r\nanimals from races already improved and well-nigh perfected, to cross\r\nwith our cattle, using none but good specimens of pure-bred males, and\r\nselecting, if our object is to improve stock for the dairy, only such as\r\nbelong to a race distinguished for dairy qualities; or, if resort is had\r\nto other breeds less remarkable for such qualities, such only as are\r\ndescended from large and generous milkers. And here it may be remarked\r\nthat these qualities do not belong to any one breed exclusively, though,\r\nas they depend mainly on structure and temperament, which are hereditary\r\nto a considerable extent, they are themselves transmissible. In almost\r\nevery breed we can find individual good milkers which greatly surpass\r\nthe average of the cows of the same race or family, and from such many\r\nsuppose that good crosses may be expected. How often do we see farmers\r\nraising the calves of their best milking-cows simply because they are\r\nthe best cows, without regard to the qualities of the bull, or to the\r\nprogenitors of either parent; and how often are they disappointed, at\r\nthe end of three or four years of labor and expense! Now, though a cow\r\nof a bad milking family, or of a breed not at all distinguished for\r\ndairy qualities, may turn out to be an excellent milker, and all else\r\nthat may be desirable in a cow, yet these qualities in her are\r\naccidental. They are not supposed to be transmissible with anything like\r\nthe certainty which exists where they are the fixed and constant\r\ncharacteristics of the family. She is an exception to the rule of her\r\nrace. A good calf from her, though not, of course, an impossibility,\r\nwould be very much the result of chance. The resort to any but a\r\ndistinguished breed of milkers cannot, therefore, be recommended, nor\r\ncan we expect to improve our dairies by it. A disregard of this\r\nimportant matter has led to endless disappointment, and has done much to\r\nraise up unjust prejudices against the use of all improved stock on our\r\nnative cows. As if we could expect nature to go out of her regular\r\ncourse to give us a good animal, when we have violated her laws!\r\n\r\nThe offspring of these crosses will be grades; but grades are often\r\nbetter for the practical purposes of the farmer than pure-bred animals.\r\nThe skill of the breeder is especially manifest in the selection of\r\nanimals to breed from, since both parents undoubtedly have a great\r\ninfluence in transmitting the milking qualities of the race. But this\r\nmethod of improvement requires less exact and critical knowledge than\r\nthe first, from the fact that it is easier to appreciate the good points\r\nof an animal already perfected, or greatly improved, than to discover\r\nthem in animals which it is our desire to improve, and which are\r\ninferior in form, possessing only the elements of a better stock. It has\r\nalso an immense advantage, since results may be far more rapidly\r\nattained, and improvements effected which, by the first method,--that of\r\ncreating or building up a race from the so-called natives, by judicious\r\nselections,--would be looked for in vain in the ordinary life of man.\r\nAll grades are produced by this second method; but all grades are not\r\nequally good, nor equally well adapted to meet the farmer’s wants. It is\r\ndesirable to know, then, what, on the whole, are the best and most\r\nprofitable to the practical farmer.\r\n\r\nWe want cattle for distinct purposes, as for milk, beef, or labor. In a\r\nlarge majority of cases,--especially in the dairy districts, comprising\r\nthe Middle and Eastern States, at least,--the farmer cares more for the\r\nmilking qualities of his cows, especially for the quantity they give,\r\nthan for their fitness for grazing, or aptness to fatten. These latter\r\npoints become more important in the Western and some of the Southern\r\nStates, where far greater attention is paid to breeding and to feeding,\r\nand where comparatively little attention is given to the productions of\r\nthe dairy. A stock of cattle that might suit one farmer might be wholly\r\nunsuited to another; and in each particular case the breeder should have\r\nsome special object in view, and select his animals with reference to\r\nit. But there are some general principles that apply to breeding\r\neverywhere, and which, in many cases, are not well understood.\r\n\r\nIt would not be desirable, even if it were possible, by crossing, to\r\nbreed out all the general characteristics of many of our native cattle.\r\nThey have many valuable qualities adapted to our climate and soil, and\r\nto the geological structure of the country; and these should be\r\npreserved, while we improve the points in which many of them are\r\ndeficient, such as a want of precocity and aptitude to fatten, where it\r\nis an object to attain this quality, coarseness of bone, and lack of\r\nsymmetry, which is often apparent, especially when the form of the\r\nanimal does not indicate a near relation to some of the established\r\nbreeds.\r\n\r\nIt’s a well-known fact that, in crossing, the produce most frequently\r\ntakes after the male parent, especially, it is thought, in exterior\r\nform, in its organs of locomotion, such as the bones, the muscles, &c.\r\nParticularly is this the case when the male belongs to an old and\r\nwell-established breed, and the female belongs to no known breed, and\r\nhas no strongly-marked and fixed points. Put a Galloway bull, for\r\ninstance, to a native cow, and the calf will, as a general rule, be\r\nhornless. Put a ram without horns to ewes with horns, and most of the\r\nlambs will be destitute of horns; that is, they take the characteristics\r\nof the father rather than the dam; and this rule holds good generally in\r\nbreeding, though, like all other rules, it has, of course, its\r\nexceptions. Hence, if this position be correct, the first principle\r\nwhich the good sense of the farmer would dictate would be to select a\r\nbull from a breed most noted for the qualities he wishes to obtain in\r\ntheir greatest perfection, and especially if the cow is deficient in\r\nthose qualities. A bull, for instance, of fine bone, and other good\r\npoints in perfection, will make up for the deficiency of some of these\r\npoints in the cow.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, say the advocates of this doctrine, in the physiology\r\nof breeding the internal structure of the offspring, the organs of\r\nsecretion, the mucous membranes, the respiratory organs, &c., are\r\nimparted chiefly by the dam. Hence it has sometimes been found that by\r\ntaking a cow remarkable for milking properties, though deficient in many\r\nother points, as in the coarseness of bone and in early maturity, and\r\nputting to her a bull remarkable for symmetry of form and fineness of\r\nbone, the offspring has been superior to the cow in beauty of form and\r\nproportions, and has still retained the milking qualities of the dam.\r\nThis principle, as already intimated, is questioned by some, who say\r\nthat the milking qualities, as well as the external form, &c., are\r\ntransmitted through the male offspring.\r\n\r\nMr. James Dickson, an experienced breeder and drover, who views the\r\nsubject from his own standpoint, says: “A great part of the art of\r\nbreeding lies in the principle of _judicious crossing_; for it is only\r\nby attending properly to this that success is to be attained, and\r\nanimals produced that shall yield the greatest amount of profit for the\r\nfood they consume. All eminent breeders know full well that ill-bred\r\nanimals are unprofitable both to the breeder and feeder. To carry out\r\nthe system of crossing judiciously, certain breeds of cattle, sheep,\r\npigs, &c., must be kept pure of their kind--males especially; indeed, as\r\na general rule, no animal possessing spurious blood, or admixture with\r\nother breeds, should be used. The produce in almost all cases\r\nassimilates to the male parent; and I should say that in crossing the\r\nuse of any males not pure-bred is _injudicious_, and ought to be\r\navoided.”\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, a cross is effected with satisfactory results, it should\r\nbe continued by resorting to pure-bred bulls, and not by the use of any\r\ngrade bulls thus obtained; for, though a grade bull may be a very fine\r\nanimal, it has been found that he does not transmit his good qualities\r\nwith anything like the certainty of a pure-bred one. The more desirable\r\nqualities are united in the bull, the better; but the special reason for\r\nthe use of a pure-bred male in crossing is not so much that the\r\nparticular individual selected has these qualities most perfectly\r\ndeveloped in himself; as that they are _hereditary in the breed_ to\r\nwhich he belongs. The moment the line is crossed, and the pedigree\r\nbroken, uncertainty commences. Although the form of the grade bull may,\r\nin individual cases, be even superior to that of his pure-bred sire, yet\r\nthere is less likelihood of his transmitting the qualities for which\r\nhis breed is most noted; and when it is considered that during his life\r\nhe may scatter his progeny over a considerable section of country, and\r\nthus affect the cattle of his whole neighborhood, attention to this\r\nbecomes a matter of no small public importance.\r\n\r\nThis principle, so far as its application to breeding for the shambles\r\nis concerned, seems to me to be sound, and fully established by long\r\nexperience and practice. Perhaps it is equally so, also, in breeding for\r\nthe dairy. But it may be well to consider whether there are not other\r\nrational modes of judgment in the selection of animals for breeding with\r\nthis specific object in view.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference of opinion with regard to the practical value of\r\nthe system of classification and judgment of milch cows discovered and\r\ndeveloped by Guénon: some being inclined to ridicule it, as absurd;\r\nothers to adopt it implicitly, and follow it out in all its details; and\r\nothers still--and among this class I generally find a very large number\r\nof the most sensible practical judges of stock--to admit that in the\r\nmain it is correct, though they discredit the practicability of carrying\r\nit so far, and so minutely into detail, as its author did.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, at the outset, that the fact that the best of the\r\nsigns of a great and good milker adopted by Guénon are generally found\r\nunited with the best forms and marks almost universally admitted and\r\npractised upon by good judges, gives, at least, some plausibility to the\r\nsystem, while the importance of it, if it be correct, is sufficient to\r\ndemand a careful examination. Every good judge of a milch cow, for\r\ninstance, wants to see in her a small, fine head, with short and\r\nyellowish horns; a soft, delicate, and close coat of hair; a skin soft\r\nand flexible over the rump; broad, well-spread ribs, covered with a\r\nloose skin of medium thickness; a broad chest; a long, slender tail;\r\nstraight hind legs; a large, regularly-formed udder, covered with short,\r\nclose, silky hair; four teats of equal size and length, set wide apart;\r\nlarge, projecting lacteal veins, which run along under the belly from\r\nthe udder towards the fore legs, forming a fork at the end, and finally\r\nlosing themselves in a round cavity; and when these points, or any\r\nconsiderable number of them, are found united in a cow, she would be\r\npronounced a good milker. An animal in which these signs are found would\r\nrarely fail of having a good “milk-mirror,” or _escutcheon_; on which\r\nGuénon, after many years of careful observation and experiment, came to\r\nlay particular stress; and on the basis of which he built up a system or\r\ntheory so complicated as to be of little practical value compared with\r\nwhat it might have been had he seen fit to simplify it so as to bring it\r\nwithin the easy comprehension of the farmer. As one means of forming a\r\njudgment of the milking qualities, however, it must be regarded as very\r\nimportant, since it is unquestionably sustained by facts in a very large\r\nmajority of cases.\r\n\r\nThe milk-mirror, or escutcheon, is formed by the hair above the udder,\r\nextending upwards between the thighs, growing in an opposite direction\r\nfrom that of other parts of the body. In well-formed mirrors, found only\r\nin cows which have the arteries which supply the milky glands large and\r\nfully developed, it ordinarily begins between the four teats in the\r\nmiddle, and ascends to the vulva, and sometimes even higher, the hair\r\ngrowing upwards. The direction of the hair is subordinate to that of the\r\narteries; for the relation existing between the direction of the hair\r\nabove the udder and the activity of the milky glands is apparent on a\r\ncareful examination of all the cases. When the lower part of the mirror\r\nis large and broad, with the hair growing from below upwards, and\r\nextending well out on the thighs, it indicates that the arteries which\r\nsupply the milky glands, and which are situated just behind it, are\r\nlarge and capable of conveying much blood, and of giving great activity\r\nto the functions of secretion.\r\n\r\nNow, in the bull, the arteries which correspond to the mammary or\r\nlacteal arteries of the cow are not so fully developed; and the\r\nescutcheons are smaller, shorter, and narrower. Guénon applied the same\r\nname, milk-mirror, to these marks in the bull; and the natural inference\r\nwas, that there should exist a correspondence or similarity in the\r\nmirror of the bull and the cow which are coupled for the purpose of\r\nproducing an offspring fit for the dairy,--that the mirror in the bull\r\nshould be of the same class, or of a better class than that of the cow.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently asserted by the advocates of Guénon’s method, and with\r\nmuch show of reason, that the very large proportion of cows of bad or\r\nindifferent milking qualities, compared with the good, is owing to the\r\nmistakes in selecting bulls without reference to the proper marks or\r\npoints. As to the transmission of the milk-mirror, it has been found in\r\nmany cases that bulls sprung from cows with good mirrors had smaller and\r\nmore heart-shaped mirrors, spreading out pretty broad upon the thighs.\r\nPabst, a successful German breeder, says that he has used such bulls for\r\nthree years, and that the milk-mirrors were transmitted in the majority\r\nof the male progeny, and in nearly every case very large and beautiful\r\nmirrors were given to the heifer-calves. A son of the bull with which he\r\nbegan was serving at the time of which he speaks, having a mirror more\r\nhighly developed than his sire, and the first calves of his get had\r\nalso very large milk-mirrors. The female offspring of the first bull of\r\ngood milk-mirror promised first rate, though they had not then come in.\r\nHis inference is, that in breeding from cows noted as milkers regard\r\nshould be had to the form of the mirror on the bull, and the chance of\r\nhis transmitting it. If any credit is due to this ingenious method, it\r\nmay be laid down, as a principle in the selection of a bull to get dairy\r\nstock, that the one possessing the largest and best-developed\r\nmilk-mirror is the best for the purpose, and will be most likely to get\r\nmilkers of large quantity and continued flow. This method will be more\r\nfully developed in the chapter on the Selection of Milch Cows.\r\n\r\nBut, however careful we may be to select good milkers, and to breed from\r\nthem with the hope of improvement, it is by no means easy to select such\r\nas are capable of transmitting their qualities to their offspring. This\r\nis rendered still more difficult by the fact that there is no known mark\r\nto indicate it, and we are left to use our own judgment; for, in the\r\ncase of bulls, we are often obliged to give them up before their progeny\r\nhave arrived at an age to show their qualities by actual trial. We are\r\nthrown back, therefore, upon their external marks. But, as M. Magne, a\r\nvery sensible French writer, justly observes in his admirable little\r\nwork (_Choix des Vaches Latières_, p. 86, Paris, 1857), the fixed\r\ncharacteristics which have existed in races for several generations will\r\nbe transmitted with most certainty. Hence the importance, he says, of\r\nselecting milch cows from good breeds and good families, and especially,\r\nin breeding stock, of selecting carefully both male and female. The male\r\ndesigned to get dairy stock ought to possess the structure which, in the\r\ncow, indicates the greatest activity of the mammary glands, as fineness\r\nof form, mellowness of skin, large hind quarters, large and\r\nwell-developed veins and escutcheon.\r\n\r\nA cow of a race or family not noted as milkers may chance to be an\r\nexcellent milker, and this is enough, if we do not desire to breed from\r\nher; but she would not transmit her exceptional qualities like a cow of\r\nwhich these qualities were the fixed characteristics, constant and\r\ntransmissible in the breed. These considerations apply also, as already\r\nsaid, in the choice of a bull. The attention of practical men has been\r\nso much directed to the best points of good cows, of late years, that it\r\nbecomes necessary to study to propagate these, if the breeder desires to\r\nfind buyers for his stock. The buyer judges more from external signs\r\nthan from the intrinsic qualities of the cow, with which he may not be\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nTo explain the variations in the transmission of milking qualities, we\r\nshould bear in mind that these qualities are not found in wild cows, and\r\nthat they are developed only when man can, by a particular course of\r\ntreatment, as by the act of milking, the separation of the sexes, etc.,\r\ncause certain natural powers to act with greater strength than others;\r\nthat they incline to disappear as soon as these powers, the nature of\r\nthe soil, the peculiarities of climate, the properties of plants, and\r\nthe temperament of the cows, are permitted to act according to the\r\noriginal plan of creation; so that the variations which we consider as\r\nsports of nature are incontestible proofs of the uniformity of her\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nIt is only by observing animals carefully, by noting accurately their\r\ngood qualities and their faults, by watching the circumstances in which\r\nindividuals are produced, raised, and kept, that we can account for what\r\nseems to us a sport or caprice of nature. We can then tell, first, how\r\nthe same bull and cow have produced three calves with different\r\nproperties; and, secondly, trace out the rules which we are to follow,\r\nto be almost uniformly successful in obtaining stock of the best\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that the qualities which are transmitted with most\r\ncertainty depend on the most important organs of life; and so, in the\r\nforms of the viscera and the skeleton, variations are rare, not only in\r\nbreeds of the same species, but in different species of the same genera.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in cases where the transmission of properties is so uncertain\r\nas to seem the result of caprice in nature, these properties are formed\r\nby superficial organs,--by the skin, the horns, the state of the hair,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nBut it is in qualities which are, in a measure, artificial, qualities\r\nproduced by domestication, and often more injurious than useful to the\r\nhealth of animals, that variations most commonly occur. These change not\r\nonly with the breed of one species, but with the different individuals\r\nof the same breed, of the same half-breed, and often of the same family.\r\n\r\nBearing these elementary principles of natural history and physiology in\r\nmind, we shall comprehend how cows and bulls well marked in regard to\r\nescutcheons have produced stock which did not resemble them. M. Lefebvre\r\nSainte Marie asserts that the influence of the escutcheons is very\r\nfeeble in the act of reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn this view, the escutcheon is almost nothing in itself. It depends on\r\nthe state of the hair, on one of the most fleeting of peculiarities, on\r\nthat which is least hereditary in animals. It has no value as a mark of\r\ngood getters of stock, unless it is supported by marks superior to it\r\nfrom their stability,--a larger skeleton, double loins, a wide rump,\r\nhighly-developed blood-vessels,--unless it is united with a spacious\r\nchest, round ribs, large lungs, and a strong constitution.\r\n\r\nThe more complete the correspondence between these marks, the more the\r\nmilking quality is connected with the general condition of the animal,\r\nthe greater the chances of transmission; and when, with a view to\r\nbreeding, we shall choose only animals having the two-fold character of\r\ngeneral vigor of constitution and activity of the mammary system, and\r\nplace the progeny under favorable circumstances, the qualities will\r\nrarely prove defective. Thus far the conclusions of Magne.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known fact in natural history is, that the size of animals\r\ndepends very much upon the fertility of the region they inhabit. Where\r\nfood is abundant and nutritious, they increase in size in proportion to\r\nthe quantity and quality; and this size, under the same circumstances,\r\nwill run through generations, unless interrupted by artificial means.\r\nSo, if the food is more difficult to obtain, and the pastures are short,\r\nthe pliancy of the animal organization is such that it naturally becomes\r\nadapted to it, and the animal is of smaller size; and hence Mr. Cline\r\nobserves that “the general mistake in crossing has arisen from an\r\nattempt to increase the size of a native race of animals, being a\r\nfruitless effort to counteract the laws of nature.” Mr. Cline also says,\r\nin his treatise “On the Form of Animals:” “Experience has proved that\r\ncrossing has only succeeded in an eminent degree in those instances in\r\nwhich the females were larger than the usual proportion of females to\r\nmales; and that it has generally failed when the males were\r\ndisproportionally large. When the male is much larger than the female,\r\nthe offspring is generally of an imperfect form; if the female be\r\nproportionally larger than the male, the offspring is generally of an\r\nimproved form. For instance, if a well-formed large ram be put to ewes\r\nproportionally smaller, the lambs will not be so well shaped as their\r\nparents; but, if a small ram be put to larger ewes, the lambs will be of\r\nan improved form.” “The improvement depends on the principle that the\r\npower of the female to supply her offspring with nourishment is in\r\nproportion to her size, and to the power of nourishing herself from the\r\nexcellence of her constitution; as larger animals eat more, the larger\r\nfemale may afford most nourishment to her young.”\r\n\r\nThis should, I am inclined to think, be regarded as another principle of\r\nbreeding,--that, when improvement in form is desired, the size of the\r\nfemale selected should be proportionally larger than the male; though\r\nLord Spencer, a successful breeder, strongly contested it, and Mr.\r\nDickson, an excellent judge of stock, advised the attempt to build up a\r\nnew breed by selecting some Zetland cows, a very diminutive breed of\r\nScotch cattle, of good symmetry, points, and handling, and a high-bred\r\nWest Highland bull to put to them. “The produce would probably be,” says\r\nhe, “a neat, handsome little animal, of a medium size, between the two\r\nbreeds. The shaggy hide, long horns, symmetry, and fine points, of the\r\nWest Highlanders, would be imparted to this cross, which would not only\r\nbe a good feeder and very hardy, but the beef of superior quality. The\r\ngreat point would, of course, be the proper selection of breeding\r\nanimals. The next step towards improving this would be the crossing of\r\nthese crosses with a pure Hereford bull, which would improve the size,\r\nand impart still finer points, more substance, with greater aptitude to\r\nfatten. By combining those favorite breeds, the produce would, in all\r\nprobability, be very superior, not only attaining to good weights, but\r\nfeeding well, and arriving at maturity at an early age. The breeder must\r\nnot be satisfied and rest here, but go a point further, and cross the\r\nheifers of the third cross with a short-horn bull.” These successive\r\nsteps imply the use of a bull of larger breed, though not necessarily,\r\nperhaps, proportionally larger than the cow, in any individual case.\r\n\r\nThis, it will be perceived, is a case of breeding with less reference to\r\nthe milking or dairy qualities than the grazing. Great milkers are found\r\nof all shapes, and the chief object of improving their form is to\r\nimprove their feeding qualities, or, in other words, to unite, as far as\r\npossible, the somewhat incompatible properties of grazing and milking.\r\nGraceful, well-rounded, and compact forms, which constitute beauty in\r\nthe eyes of the grazier, as well as in the estimation of those not\r\naccustomed to consider the intrinsic qualities of an animal, or not\r\ncapable of appreciating them in a milch cow, will very rarely be found\r\nunited, to any considerable extent, with active mammary glands or milk\r\nvessels. The best milkers often look coarse and flabby; for, even if\r\ntheir bony structure is good and symmetrical, they will appear,\r\nespecially when in milk, to have large, raw bones and sharp points,\r\nparticularly if they are largely developed in the hind quarters, which\r\nis most frequently the case, as is strikingly seen in the form of the\r\nOakes cow, a native animal, the most celebrated of her time, in\r\nMassachusetts, and winner of the first premium at the State Fair of\r\n1816.\r\n\r\nShe yielded in that year no less than four hundred and sixty-seven and a\r\nquarter pounds of butter from May 15th to December 20th, at which time\r\nshe was giving over eight quarts of milk, beer measure, a day. The\r\nweight of her milk in the height of the season, in June, was but\r\nforty-four and a half pounds; not so great as that of some cows of the\r\npresent day, on far less feed in proportion to their size. Many cows\r\ncan be named in New England, at the present time, whose yield, under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances, exceeds fifty pounds a day, and some,\r\nwhose yield will be fifty-five pounds, on less feed than the Oakes cow\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Oakes Cow.]\r\n\r\nThe flesh on the hindquarters of most large milkers bears little\r\nproportion to the bone; the hips protrude, the pelvis is broad, the legs\r\nfar apart, giving great space for the receptacle of large milk-vessels;\r\nwhilst great flow of blood to the milky glands, incident to this\r\npeculiar structure, keeps them in more constant and greater activity\r\nthan any other organs, so that the muscles develop less than they\r\notherwise would, remain slender, and leave the buttocks and thighs small\r\nand narrow. Such animals will seldom acquire the reputation of being\r\nbeautiful in form, and if they are not decidedly ugly, the owner may\r\nconsole himself with the adage that “handsome is that handsome does.”\r\n\r\nBut, though it is to the influence of the male that we are chiefly to\r\nlook for improvements in the form, size, muscular development, and\r\ngeneral appearance, of our stock, and for transmitting their milking\r\nqualities, to a considerable extent, the influence of the female is no\r\nless important; and undoubtedly the safest course to pursue, to obtain\r\nimproved animals, is to select the best-formed animals, on both sides,\r\nfrom the greatest milking families.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the particular breeds to select for crossing with our\r\nnatives, opinions will naturally differ widely. Those who are favored\r\nwith luxuriant pastures and abundance of winter feed will have no\r\nobjection to large-sized animals, and will naturally wish to obtain or\r\npossess grade short-horns. There is no breed in the world to which it is\r\nmore desirable to resort, under such circumstances, particularly where\r\nimprovement in form, early maturity, and general symmetry, are sought,\r\nin union with other qualities. It is well known that some families of\r\nshort-horns have been bred for the pail, while most others have been\r\nbred chiefly for beef. If resort is had to this breed, therefore, great\r\ncare and caution should be observed to select bulls from the milking\r\nfamilies only; and, unless this is done we shall run the risk of losing\r\nthe milking qualities of our stock, for which the improvement in form\r\nand early maturity can be little compensation, when breeding for the\r\ndairy.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable and significant fact that the large dairies of London\r\nare nearly filled with the short-horns, or short-horn and Yorkshire\r\ngrades; and the fact that this breed is selected in such circumstances\r\nfor the production of milk to supply the milk-market speaks volumes in\r\nfavor of this cross. It is found that grade short-horns, after yielding\r\nextraordinary quantities of milk, during which they very naturally\r\npresent the most ungainly appearance, will, when dried off and fed,\r\ntake on flesh very rapidly, and yield large weights of beef. This is one\r\nprominent reason for keeping them; and another is, that they occupy less\r\nspace than would be required to produce the same quantity of milk from\r\nsmaller animals, which might give even more milk per cow in proportion\r\nto size and food consumed.\r\n\r\nThe cross of the well-bred short-horn and the native or Dutch cows of\r\nthe dairy districts of New York is very highly esteemed; and six hundred\r\npounds of cheese a year is no uncommon yield for such grades in Herkimer\r\nand adjacent counties.\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshires have been tried in the London dairies, but it was found\r\nthat they were too difficult to obtain in sufficient numbers, and at\r\nsufficiently low prices; and that where quantity was the chief object,\r\nas in a milk-dairy, and space a matter of great importance, they could\r\nnot compete with the short-horn and the Yorkshire cows, and crosses\r\nbetween these races.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, particularly in milk-dairies, that the farmer is so\r\nsituated as not to desire to raise his calves, but disposes of them at\r\nthe highest price to the butcher. He will obtain the greatest weight and\r\nthe highest quality of veal from the use of a pure-bred short-horn or\r\nHereford bull. But, on poorer pastures, where there is too little feed\r\nto bring young stock to their most perfect development, the pure-bred\r\nshort-horns and high grades of the short-horn are thought, by some, to\r\nbe too large, and consequently unprofitable. How far this objection to\r\nthem might be obviated by stall feeding or soiling, and the use of\r\nroots, is for each one to consider who has these facilities at command.\r\nFor most parts of New England they are unquestionably too large to be\r\nwell maintained.\r\n\r\nAs to the Herefords, they cannot be recommended for the dairy, either as\r\npure bloods or grades; but in grazing districts, devoted to raising\r\nbeef or working cattle, they are highly and justly prized.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the North Devons. The pure-bred Devon bull, put\r\nto a good, young native cow, produces a beautiful and valuable cross,\r\neither for the yoke or the shambles; and if the cow is a remarkably good\r\nmilker to begin with, and the bull from a milking family, there would be\r\nno fear of materially lessening the quantity in the offspring, while its\r\nform, and other qualities, would probably be greatly improved.\r\n\r\nGrade Devons are very much sought for working oxen, and high prices are\r\nreadily obtained for them, while as beef cattle they are by some highly\r\nesteemed. But, unfortunately, very few herds are to be found where\r\nattention has been paid to breeding for milk; and great milkers are the\r\nexception, and very rarely met with among the pure breeds. In their\r\nnative country they are bred almost exclusively for beef. The estimation\r\nin which they are held as dairy stock, even by Devon breeders\r\nthemselves, both in England and in this country, has been shown in the\r\nlow value placed upon the development of the udder in the establishment\r\nof the scale of points spoken of on a preceding page; from which it is\r\nevident that, in judging of them, it was not contemplated that their\r\nmilking qualities should be taken into consideration. As cows for the\r\ndairy, therefore, they possess no advantages over our common stock, and\r\nwe should hardly look for improvement from them in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe Jerseys, as already seen, are justly celebrated for the richness of\r\ntheir milk and the butter made from it. In this respect no pure breed\r\ncan excel them. They are, therefore, as a dairy breed, worthy of\r\nattention. On farms where the making of butter is an object of pursuit\r\nand profit, an infusion of Jersey blood will be likely to secure\r\nrichness of milk, and high-flavored, delicious butter. Many good judges\r\nof stock recommend this cross for dairy purposes; and the chief\r\nobjection that can be urged against them is that they are, as a breed,\r\nvery deficient in quantity, which in a milk-dairy would be fatal to\r\nthem, while, at the same time, they have little to recommend them, as\r\nthe Devons have, on the score of beautiful forms and symmetrical\r\nproportions. Put upon a large and roomy native cow, remarkable as a\r\nmilker, the produce would be likely to be a very superior animal.\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshires, as already seen, have been bred with reference both to\r\nquality and quantity of milk, and the grades are usually of a very high\r\norder. The best milkers I have ever known, in proportion to their size\r\nand food, have been grade Ayrshires; and this is also the experience of\r\nmany who keep dairies for the manufacture of butter and cheese, as well\r\nas for the sale of milk. A cross obtained from an Ayrshire bull of good\r\nsize and a pure-bred short-horn cow will produce a stock which it will\r\nbe hard to beat at the pail, especially if the cow belong to any of the\r\nfamilies of short-horns which have been bred with reference to their\r\nmilking qualities, as some of them have. I have taken great pains to\r\ninquire of dairymen as to the breed or grade of their best cows, and\r\nwhat they consider the best cows for milk for their purposes; and the\r\nanswer has almost invariably been the Ayrshire and the native. The\r\nAyrshires have by no means been a failure in this country, although I do\r\nnot think that, as a general thing, we have been so fortunate hitherto\r\nas to import the best specimens of them. If any improvement has been\r\nmade in our dairy stock apart from that effected by a higher and more\r\nliberal course of feeding, it has come, in a great measure, from the\r\nAyrshires; and, had the facilities been offered to cross our common\r\nstock with them to greater extent, there can be little doubt that the\r\nimprovement would have been greater and more perceptible.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be said, that in sections where the feed is\r\nnaturally luxuriant, and adapted to grazing large animals, some families\r\nof the short-horns crossed with our natives have produced an equally\r\ngood stock for cheese and milk dairies.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this part of the subject, it is proper to observe that\r\namong the earlier importations were several varieties of hornless\r\ncattle, and that they have been kept distinct in some sections, or where\r\nthey have been crossed with the common stock there has been a tendency\r\nto produce hornless grades. These are not unfrequently known under the\r\nname of buffalo cattle. They were, in many cases, supposed to have\r\nbelonged to the Galloway breed; or, which is more likely, to the Suffolk\r\ndun, a variety of the Galloway, and a far better milking-stock than the\r\nGalloways, from which it sprung. The polled, or hornless cattle, vary in\r\ncolor and qualities, but they are usually very good milkers when well\r\nkept, and many of them fatten well, and attain good weights.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian cattle have also been imported, to some extent, into\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and have been crossed upon the natives\r\nwith some success. Many other strains of blood from different breeds\r\nhave contributed to build up the common stock of the country of the\r\npresent day; and there can be no question that its appearance and value\r\nhave been largely improved during the last quarter of a century, nor\r\nthat improvements are still in progress which will lead to satisfactory\r\nresults in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF MILCH COWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed the prominent races of cattle found in American\r\ndairy herds, and devoted some space to an examination of the principles\r\nto be followed in the breeding of dairy stock; and this has involved, to\r\nsome extent, the choice of breeds, and the selection of individual\r\nanimals, with special reference, however, to transmitting and improving\r\ntheir milking properties. But the selection of cows for the dairy is of\r\nsuch importance as to demand the most careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThe objects of a dairy are three-fold: the production of milk for sale,\r\nmainly confined to milk-dairies, and to smaller farms in the vicinity of\r\nlarge towns, where a mixed husbandry is followed; the production of\r\nbutter, chiefly confined to farms at a distance from cities and large\r\ntowns, which furnish a ready market for milk; and the fabrication of\r\ncheese, carried on under circumstances somewhat, similar to the\r\nmanufacture of butter, and sometimes united with it as an object of\r\npursuit, on the farm.\r\n\r\nThese different objects should, therefore, be kept in view, in the\r\nselection of cows; for animals which would be most profitable for the\r\nmilk-dairy might be very unprofitable in the butter-dairy--a fact of\r\nalmost daily experience. The productiveness of the cow does not depend\r\non her breed so much as upon her food and management, her temperament\r\nand health, and the activity and energy of the organs of digestion and\r\nsecretion. These latter, it is true, depending upon the structure of\r\nthe chest and other parts, are far better developed, and more\r\npermanently fixed, in some races than in others, and are derived more or\r\nless by descent, and capable of being transmitted. The breed, therefore,\r\ncannot be wholly disregarded, inasmuch as it is an element in forming a\r\njudgment of the merits of a milch cow.\r\n\r\nCows, of whatever breed, having the best developed external marks of\r\ngood milkers, will very rarely disappoint the practised eye or the\r\nskilful hand; while cows of breeds in highest repute for the dairy, and\r\nwhich do not show these marks, will as certainly fail to answer the\r\nexpectations of those who select them simply for the breed. Those who\r\nwould obtain skill in judging of these marks, and by means of them be\r\nable to estimate the value of a cow, need not expect to attain this end\r\nwithout long study and practical observation, for which some men have\r\nfar greater talent than others; being able, while examining a particular\r\nmark or favorite characteristic of a milker, to take in all others at a\r\nglance, and so, while appearing to form their opinion from one or two\r\nimportant points, actually to estimate the whole development of the\r\nanimal, while others must examine in detail each point by itself. Long\r\npractice is required, therefore, to become an adept in the judgment and\r\nselection of milch cows; but still much assistance may, unquestionably,\r\nbe derived by careful attention to the external signs which have been\r\nlong observed to indicate the milking qualities.\r\n\r\nIt is important, in the first place, to be able to judge of the age of\r\nthe cow. Few farmers wish to purchase a cow for the dairy after she has\r\npassed her prime, which will ordinarily be at the age of nine or ten\r\nyears, varying, of course, according to care, feeding, &c., in the\r\nearlier part of her life.\r\n\r\nThe most usual mode of forming an estimate of the age of cattle is by an\r\nexamination of the horn. At three years old, as a general rule, the\r\nhorns are perfectly smooth; after this, a ring appears near the root,\r\nand annually afterward a new one is formed; so that, by adding two years\r\nto the first ring, the age is calculated. This is a very uncertain mode\r\nof judging. The rings are distinct only in the cow; and it is well known\r\nthat, if a heifer goes to bull when she is two years old, or a little\r\nbefore or after that time, a change takes place in the horn, and the\r\nfirst ring appears; so that a real three-year-old would carry the mark\r\nof a four-year-old.\r\n\r\nThe rings on the horns of a bull are either not seen until five, or they\r\ncannot be traced at all; while in the ox they do not appear till he is\r\nfive years old, and then are often very indistinct. In addition to this,\r\nit is by no means an uncommon practice to file the horns, so as to make\r\nthem smooth, and to give the animal the appearance of being much younger\r\nthan it really is. This is, therefore, an exceedingly fallacious guide,\r\nand we cannot rely on it without being subject to imposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Teeth at birth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Second week.]\r\n\r\nThe surest indication of the age is given by the teeth. The calf, at\r\nbirth, will usually have two incisor or front teeth; in some cases just\r\nappearing through the gums; in others, fully set, varying as the cow\r\nfalls short or exceeds her regular time of calving. If she overruns\r\nseveral days, the teeth will have set and attained considerable size, as\r\nappears in Fig. 15. During the second week, a tooth will usually be\r\nadded on each side, and the mouth will generally appear as in Fig. 16;\r\nand, before the end of the third week, the animal will generally have\r\nsix incisor teeth, as shown in Fig. 17; and in a week from that time the\r\nfull number of incisors will have appeared, as seen in Fig. 18.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Third week.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Month.]\r\n\r\nThese teeth are temporary, and are often called milk-teeth. Their edge\r\nis very sharp; and, as the animal begins to live upon more solid food,\r\nthis edge becomes worn, showing the bony part of the tooth beneath, and\r\nindicates, with considerable precision, the length of time they have\r\nbeen used. The centre or oldest teeth show the marks of age first, and\r\noften become somewhat worn before the corner teeth appear. At eight\r\nweeks, the four inner teeth are nearly as sharp as before. They appear\r\nworn not so much on the outer edge or line of the tooth, as inside this\r\nline; but, after this, the edge begins gradually to lose its sharpness,\r\nand to present a more flattened surface; while the next outer teeth wear\r\ndown like the four central ones; and at three months this wearing off is\r\nvery apparent, till at four months all the incisor teeth appear worn,\r\nbut the inner ones the most. Now the teeth begin slowly to diminish in\r\nsize by a kind of contraction, as well as wearing down, and the\r\ndistance apart becomes more and more apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Five to eight months.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Ten months.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Twelve months.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. Fifteen months.]\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth to the eighth month the inner teeth will usually appear\r\nas in Fig. 19; and at ten months this change shows more clearly, as in\r\nFig. 20, and the spaces between them begin to show very plainly, till at\r\na year old they ordinarily present the appearance of Fig. 21; and at the\r\nage of fifteen months that shown in Fig. 22, where the corner teeth are\r\nnot more than half the original size, and the centre ones still smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Eighteen months.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Two years past.]\r\n\r\nThe permanent teeth are now rapidly growing, and preparing to take the\r\nplace of the milk-teeth, which are gradually absorbed till they\r\ndisappear, or are pushed out to give place to the two permanent central\r\nincisors, which, at a year and a half, will generally present the\r\nappearance indicated in Fig. 23, which shows the internal structure of\r\nthe lower jaw at this time, with the cells of the teeth, the two central\r\nones protruding into the mouth, the two next pushing up, but not quite\r\ngrown to the surface, with the third pair just perceptible. These\r\nchanges require time; and at two years past the jaw will usually appear\r\nas in Fig. 24, where four of the permanent central incisors are seen.\r\nAfter this the other milk-teeth decrease rapidly, but are slow to\r\ndisappear; and at three years old the third pair of permanent teeth are\r\nbut formed, as in Fig. 25; and at four years the last pair of incisors\r\nwill be up, as in Fig. 26; but the outside ones are not yet fully grown,\r\nand the beast can hardly be said to be full-mouthed till the age of five\r\nyears. But before this age, or at the age of four years, the two inner\r\npairs of permanent teeth are beginning to wear at the edges, as shown in\r\nFig. 26, while at five years old the whole set becomes somewhat worn\r\ndown at the top, and on the two centre ones a darker line appears in the\r\nmiddle, along a line of harder bone, as appears in Fig. 27.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Three years past.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Four years past.]\r\n\r\nNow will come a year or two, and sometimes three, when the teeth do not\r\nso clearly indicate the exact age, and the judgment must be guided by\r\nthe extent to which the dark middle lines are worn. This will depend\r\nsomewhat upon the exposure and feeding of the animal; but at seven years\r\nthese lines extend over all the teeth. At eight years another change\r\nbegins, which cannot be mistaken. A kind of absorption begins with the\r\ntwo central incisors, slow, at first, but perceptible, and these two\r\nteeth become smaller than the rest, while the dark lines are worn into\r\none in all but the corner teeth, till at ten years four of the central\r\nincisors have become smaller in size, with a smaller and fainter mark,\r\nas seen in Fig. 28. At eleven the six inner teeth are smaller than the\r\ncorner ones; and at twelve all become smaller than they were, while the\r\ndark lines are nearly gone, except in the corner teeth, and the inner\r\nedge is worn to the gum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Five years past.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Ten years past.]\r\n\r\nAfter being satisfied with regard to the age of a cow, we should examine\r\nher with reference to her soundness of constitution. A good constitution\r\nis indicated by large lungs, which are found in a deep, broad, and\r\nprominent chest, broad and well-spread ribs, a respiration somewhat slow\r\nand regular, a good appetite, and if in milk a strong inclination to\r\ndrink, which a large secretion of milk almost invariably stimulates. In\r\nsuch cows the digestive organs are active and energetic, and they make\r\nan abundance of good blood, which in turn stimulates the activity of\r\nthe nervous system, and furnishes the milky glands with the means of\r\nabundant secretion. Such cows, when dry, readily take on fat. When\r\nactivity of the milk-glands is found united with close ribs, small and\r\nfeeble lungs, and a slow appetite, often attended by great thirst, the\r\ncow will generally possess only a weak and feeble constitution; and if\r\nthe milk is plentiful, it will generally be of bad quality, while the\r\nanimal, if she does not die of diseased lungs, will not take on fat\r\nreadily when dry and fed.\r\n\r\nOther external marks of great milkers have already been given in part.\r\nThey should be found united, as far as possible; for, though no one of\r\nthem, however well developed, can be taken as a sure indication of\r\nextraordinary milking powers, several of them united may, as a general\r\nrule, be implicitly relied on.\r\n\r\nIn order to have no superfluous flesh, the cow should have a small,\r\nclean, and rather long head, tapering towards the muzzle. A cow with a\r\nlarge, coarse head will seldom fatten readily, or give a large quantity\r\nof milk. A coarse head increases the proportion of weight of the least\r\nvaluable parts, while it is a sure indication that the whole bony\r\nstructure is too heavy. The mouth should be large and broad; the eye\r\nbright and sparkling, but of a peculiar placidness of expression, with\r\nno indication of wildness, but rather a mild and feminine look. These\r\npoints will indicate gentleness of disposition. Such cows seem to like\r\nto be milked, are fond of being caressed, and often return caresses. The\r\nhorns should be small, short, tapering, yellowish, and glistening. The\r\nneck should be small, thin, and tapering towards the head, but\r\nthickening when it approaches the shoulder; the dewlaps small. The fore\r\nquarters should be rather small when compared with the hind quarters.\r\nThe form of the barrel will be large, and each rib should project\r\nfurther than the preceding one, up to the loins. She should be well\r\nformed across the hips and in the rump.\r\n\r\nThe spine or back-bone should be straight and long, rather loosely hung,\r\nor open along the middle part, the result of the distance between the\r\ndorsal vertebræ, which sometimes causes a slight depression, or sway\r\nback. By some good judges this mark is regarded as of great importance,\r\nespecially when the bones of the hind quarters are also rather loosely\r\nput together, leaving the rump of great width, and the pelvis large, and\r\nthe organs and milk-vessels lodged in the cavities largely developed.\r\nThe skin over the rump should be loose and flexible. This point is of\r\ngreat importance; and as, when the cow is in low condition, or very\r\npoor, it will appear somewhat harder and closer than it otherwise would,\r\nsome practice and close observation are required to judge well of this\r\nmark. The skin, indeed, all over the body, should be soft and mellow to\r\nthe touch, with soft and glossy hair. The tail, if thick at the setting\r\non, should taper and be fine below.\r\n\r\nBut the udder is of special importance. It should be large in proportion\r\nto the size of the animal, and the skin thin, with soft, loose folds\r\nextending well back, capable of great distension when filled, but\r\nshrinking to a small compass when entirely empty. It must be free from\r\nlumps in every part, and provided with four teats set well apart, and of\r\nmedium size. Nor are the milk-veins less important to be carefully\r\nobserved. The principal ones under the belly should be large and\r\nprominent, and extend forward to the navel, losing themselves,\r\napparently, in the very best milkers, in a large cavity in the flesh,\r\ninto which the end of the finger can be inserted; but, when the cow is\r\nnot in full milk, the milk-vein, at other times very prominent, is not\r\nso distinctly traced; and hence, to judge of its size when the cow is\r\ndry, or nearly so, this vein may be pressed near its end, or at its\r\nentrance into the body, when it will immediately fill up to its full\r\nsize. This vein does not carry the milk to the udder, as some suppose,\r\nbut is the channel by which the blood returns; and its contents consist\r\nof the refuse of the secretion, or what has not been taken up in forming\r\nmilk. There are, also, veins in the udder, and the perineum, or the\r\nspace above the udder, and between that and the buttocks, which it is of\r\nspecial importance to observe. These veins should be largely developed,\r\nand irregular or knotted, especially those of the udder. They may be\r\nseen in Figs. 29, 30, 31, &c. They are largest in great milkers.\r\n\r\nThe knotted veins of the perineum, extending from above downwards in a\r\nwinding line, are not readily seen in young heifers, and are very\r\ndifficult to find in poor cows, or cows of only a medium quality. They\r\nare easily found in very good milkers, and, if not at first apparent,\r\nthey are made so by pressing upon them at the base of the perineum, when\r\nthey swell up, and send the blood back towards the vulva. They form a\r\nkind of thick network under the skin of the perineum, raising it up\r\nsomewhat, in some cases near the vulva, in others lower down and nearer\r\nto the udder. It is important to look for these veins, as they often\r\nform a very important guide, and by some they would be considered as\r\nfurnishing the surest indications of the milking qualities of the cow.\r\nTheir full development almost always indicates an abundant secretion of\r\nmilk; but they are far better developed after the cow has had two or\r\nthree calves, when two or three years’ milking has given full activity\r\nto the milky glands, and attracted a large flow of blood. The larger and\r\nmore prominent these veins, the better. It is needless to say that in\r\nobserving them some regard should be had to the condition of the cow,\r\nthe thickness of skin and fat by which they may be surrounded, and the\r\ngeneral activity and food of the animal. Food calculated to stimulate\r\nthe greatest flow of milk will naturally increase these veins, and give\r\nthem more than usual prominence.\r\n\r\nWe come now to an examination of the system of Guénon, whose discovery,\r\nwhatever may be said of it, has proved of immense importance to\r\nagriculture. Guénon was a man of remarkable practical sagacity, a close\r\nobserver of stock, and an excellent judge. This gave him a great\r\nadvantage in securing the respect of those with whom he came in contact,\r\nand assisted him vastly in introducing his ideas to the knowledge of\r\nintelligent men. Born in France, in the vicinity of Bordeaux, in humble\r\ncircumstances, he early had the care of cows, and spent his whole life\r\nwith them. His discovery, for which a gold medal was awarded by the\r\nagricultural society of Bordeaux, on the 4th of July, 1837, consisted in\r\nthe connection between the milking qualities of the cow and certain\r\nexternal marks on the udder, and on the space above it, called the\r\nperineum, extending to the buttocks. To these marks he gave the name of\r\nmilk-mirror, or escutcheon, which consists in certain perceptible spots\r\nrising up from the udder in different directions, forms, and sizes, on\r\nwhich the hair grows upwards, whilst the hair on other parts of the body\r\ngrows downwards. To these spots various names have been given, according\r\nto their size and position, as tufts, fringes, figures or escutcheons,\r\nwhich last, is the most common term used. The reduction of these marks\r\ninto a system, explaining the value of particular forms and sizes of the\r\nmilk-mirror, belongs, so far as I know, exclusively to Guénon, though\r\nthe connection of the milking qualities of the cow and the size of the\r\novals with downward-growing hair on the back part of the udder above\r\nthe teats was observed and known in Massachusetts more than forty years\r\nage, and some of the old farmers of that day were accustomed to say that\r\nwhen these spots were large and well developed the cow would be a good\r\nmilker.\r\n\r\nGuénon divided the milk-mirror into eight classes, and each class into\r\neight orders, making in all no less than sixty-four divisions, which he\r\nafterwards increased by sub-divisions, making the whole system\r\ncomplicated in the extreme, especially as he professed to be able to\r\njudge with accuracy, by means of the milk-mirror, not only of the exact\r\nquantity a cow would give, but also the quality of the milk and the\r\nlength of time it would continue. He tried to prove too much, and the\r\nconsequence was that he was himself frequently at fault, notwithstanding\r\nhis excellent knowledge of other general characteristics of milch cows,\r\nwhile others, of less knowledge, and far more liable to err in judgment,\r\nwere inclined to view the whole system with distrust.\r\n\r\nMy own attention was called to Guénon’s method of judging of cows some\r\neight or ten years ago, and since that time I have examined many\r\nhundreds, with a view to ascertain the correctness of its main features,\r\ninquiring, at the same time, after the views and opinions of the best\r\nbreeders and judges of stock, with regard to their experience and\r\njudgment of it merits; and the result of my observation has been, that\r\ncows with the most perfectly-developed milk-mirrors, or escutcheons,\r\nare, with rare exceptions, the best milkers of their breed, and that\r\ncows with small and slightly-developed mirrors are, in the majority of\r\ncases, bad milkers.\r\n\r\nI say the best milkers _of their breed_; for I do not believe that\r\nprecisely the same sized and formed milk-mirrors on a Hereford or a\r\nDevon, and an Ayrshire or a native, will indicate anything like the\r\nsame or equal milking properties. It will not do, in my opinion, to\r\ndisregard the general and well-known characteristics of the breed, and\r\nrely wholly on the milk-mirror. But I think it may be safely said that,\r\nas a general rule the best-marked Hereford will turn out to be the best\r\nmilker among the Herefords, all of which are poor milkers; the\r\nbest-marked Devon the best among the Devons, and the best-marked\r\nAyrshire the best among the Ayrshires; that is, it will not do to\r\ncompare two animals of entirely distinct breeds, by the milk-mirrors\r\nalone, without regard to the fixed habits and education, so to speak, of\r\nthe breed or family to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThere are cows with very small mirrors, which are, nevertheless, very\r\nfair in the yield of milk; and among these with middling quality of\r\nmirrors instances of rather more than ordinary milkers often occur,\r\nwhile at the same time it is true that now and then cases occur where\r\nthe very best marked and developed mirrors are found on very poor\r\nmilkers. I once owned a cow of most extraordinary marks, the milk-mirror\r\nextending out broadly upon the thighs, and rising broad and very\r\ndistinctly marked to the buttocks, giving every indication, to good\r\njudges, of being as great a milker as ever stood over a pail; and yet,\r\nwhen she calved, the calf was feeble and half nourished, and she\r\nactually gave too little to feed it. But I believe that this exception,\r\nand most others which appear to be direct contradictions, could be\r\nclearly explained by the fact, of which I was not aware at the time,\r\nthat she had been largely over-fed before she came into my possession. I\r\nmention this case simply to show how impossible it is to estimate with\r\nmathematical accuracy either the quantity, the quality, or the duration\r\nof the milk, since it is affected by so many chance circumstances,\r\nwhich cannot always be known or estimated by even the most skilful\r\njudge; as the food, the treatment, the temperament, accidental diseases,\r\ninflammation of the udder, premature calving, the climate and season,\r\nthe manner in which she has been milked, and a thousand other things\r\nwhich interrupt or influence the flow of milk, without, materially\r\nchanging the size or the shape of the milk-mirror. M. Magne, who appears\r\nto me to have simplified and explained the system of Guénon, and to have\r\nfreed it from many of the useless details with which it is encumbered in\r\nthe original work, while he has preserved all that is of practical\r\nvalue, very justly observes that we often see cows, equally well formed,\r\nwith precisely the same milk-mirror, and kept in the same circumstances,\r\nyet giving neither equal quantities nor similar qualities of milk. Nor\r\ncould it be otherwise; for, assuming a particular tuft on two cows to be\r\nof equal value at birth, it could not be the same in the course of\r\nyears, since innumerable circumstances occur to change the activity of\r\nthe milky glands without changing the form or size of the tuft; or, in\r\nother words, the action of the organs depends not merely on their size\r\nand form, but, to a great extent, on the general condition of each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nTe give a more distinct idea of the milk-mirror, it will be necessary to\r\nrefer to the figures, and the explanations of these I translate\r\nliterally from the little work already referred to, the _Choix des\r\nVaches Latières_, or, the Choice of Milch Cows.\r\n\r\nThe different forms of milk-mirrors are represented by the shaded part\r\nof figures 29, 30, 31, etc.; but it is necessary to premise that upon\r\nthe cows themselves they are always partly concealed by the thighs, the\r\nudder, and the folds of the skin, which are not shown, and so they are\r\nnot always so uniform in nature as they appear in the cuts.\r\n\r\nTheir size varies as the skin is more or less folded or stretched, while\r\nwe have supposed in the figures that the skin is uniform or free from\r\nfolds, but not stretched out. In order to understand the differences\r\nwhich the milk-mirrors present in respect to size, according to the\r\nstate of the skin, the milk-mirror is shown in two ways in Figs. 52 and\r\n53. In Fig. 53 the proportions are preserved the same as in the other\r\nmirrors represented, but an effort is made to represent the folds of the\r\nskin; while in Fig. 52 the mirror is just as it would have been had the\r\nfolds of the udder been smoothed out, and the skin between the udder and\r\nthe thighs stretched out; or, in other words, as if the skin, covered\r\nwith up-growing hair, had been fully extended.\r\n\r\nThis mirror, but little developed, just as shown in Fig. 53, was\r\nobserved on a very large Norman cow.\r\n\r\nIt is usually very easy to distinguish the milk-mirrors by the upward\r\ndirection of the hair which forms them. They are sometimes marked by a\r\nline of bristly hair growing in the opposite direction, which surrounds\r\nthem, forming a sort of outline by the upward and downward growing hair.\r\nYet, when the hair is very fine and short, mixed with longer hairs, and\r\nthe skin much folded, and the udder voluminous and pressed by the\r\nthighs, it is necessary, in order to distinguish the part enclosed\r\nbetween the udder and the legs, and examine the full size of the\r\nmirrors, to observe them attentively, and to place the legs wide apart,\r\nand to smooth out the skin, in order to avoid the folds.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors may also be observed by holding the back of the hand against\r\nthe perineum, and drawing it from above downwards, when the nails\r\nrubbing against the up-growing hair, make the parts covered by it very\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nAs the hair of the milk-mirror has not the same direction as the hair\r\nwhich surrounds it, it may often be distinguished by a difference in the\r\nshade reflected by it. It is then sufficient to place it properly to the\r\nlight to see the difference in shade, and to make out the part covered\r\nby the upward-growing hair. Most frequently, however, the hair of the\r\nmilk-mirror is thin and fine, and the color of the skin can easily be\r\nseen. If we trust alone to the eye, we shall often be deceived. Thus, in\r\nFigs. 52 and 53, the shaded part, which extends from the vulva to the\r\nmirror E, represents a strip of hair of a brownish tint, which covered\r\nthe perineum, and which might easily have been taken for a part of the\r\nmilk-mirror.\r\n\r\nIn some countries cattle-dealers shave the back part of the cows. Just\r\nafter this operation the mirrors can neither be seen nor felt; but this\r\ninconvenience ceases in a few days. It may be added that the shaving,\r\ndesigned, as the dealers say, to beautify the cow, is generally intended\r\nsimply to destroy the milk-mirror, and to deprive buyers of one means of\r\njudging of the milking qualities of the cows.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add that the cows most carefully shaven are those\r\nwhich are badly marked, and that it is prudent to take it for granted\r\nthat cows so shorn are bad milkers.\r\n\r\nMilk-mirrors vary in position, extent, and the figure they represent.\r\nThey may be divided, according to their position, into mirrors or\r\nescutcheons, properly so called, or into lower and upper tufts, or\r\nescutcheons. The latter are very small in comparison with the former,\r\nand are situated in close proximity to the vulva, as seen at S in Figs.\r\n38, 39, 40, etc. They are very common on cows of bad milking races, but\r\nare very rarely seen on the best milch cows. They consist of one or two\r\novals, or small bands of up-growing hair, and serve to indicate the\r\ncontinuance of the flow of milk. The period is short in proportion as\r\nthe tufts are large. They must not be confounded with the escutcheon\r\nproper, which is often extended up to the vulva. They are separated from\r\nit by bands of hair, more or less large, as in Figs. 40, 42, &c.\r\n\r\nThe mirrors shown in Figs. 38 to 42, and 29 to 35, &c., exist, more or\r\nless developed, on nearly all cows, and indicate the quantity of milk,\r\nwhich will be in proportion to their size. Sometimes they form only a\r\nsmall plate on the posterior surface of the udder, as in Fig. 49. In\r\nother cases they cover the udder, the inner surface of the legs and the\r\nthighs, the perineum, and a part of the buttocks, as in Figs. 29, 30,\r\n31, &c.\r\n\r\nTwo parts may be distinguished in the lower tufts: one situated on the\r\nudder, the legs, and the thighs, as at M M, Fig. 30; and the other on\r\nthe perineum, extending sometimes more or less out upon the thighs, as\r\nat P P, in the same figure.\r\n\r\nThe first part is represented by itself, in Figs. 37 and 49. We shall\r\ncall the former _mammary_, and the latter _perinean_. The former is\r\nsometimes large, extending over the milky glands, the thighs, and the\r\nlegs, as shown in Figs. 29 to 37; and sometimes circumscribed, or more\r\nor less checked over with tufts of downward-growing hair, as in Figs. 43\r\nto 52. It is sometimes terminated towards the upper part of the udder by\r\na horizontal line, straight, as in Fig. 37, or angular, as in Fig. 49;\r\nbut more frequently it continues without interruption over the perineum,\r\nand constitutes the _perinean_ part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nThis presents a large band, Fig. 30, straight, as in Fig. 43, and\r\nbounded on the sides by two parallel lines, as seen in the same\r\nfigures, or by curved lines, as in Fig. 34. It sometimes rises scarcely\r\na fourth part up the perineum, as in Fig. 38; at others, it reaches or\r\npasses beyond that part, forming a straight band, as in Figs. 35 and 43,\r\nor is folded into squares, as in Figs. 31 and 36, or truncated, Fig. 38,\r\nor terminated by one or several points, Figs. 32, 33, 41, 50. In some\r\ncows this band extends as far as the base of the vulva, Figs. 40 and 48;\r\nin others, it embraces more or less of the lower part of the vulva,\r\nFigs. 29, 30, 39, and 47.\r\n\r\nMilk-mirrors are sometimes symmetrical, as in Figs. 29, 30, 34, 35, 37,\r\nand 38; sometimes without symmetry, as in Figs. 42, 45, and 50. When\r\nthere is a great difference in the extent of the two halves, it almost\r\nalways happens that the teats on the side where the mirror is best\r\ndeveloped give, as we shall see, more milk than those of the opposite\r\nside. We will remark here that the left half of the mirror is almost\r\nalways the largest; and so, when the perinean part is folded into a\r\nsquare, it is on this side of the body that it unfolds, as in Figs. 31,\r\n36, and 42. Of three thousand cows in Denmark, M. Andersen found only a\r\nsingle one whose escutcheon varied even a little from this rule. We have\r\nobserved the contrary only in a single case, and that was on a bull. The\r\nperinean part of the mirror formed a band of an inch to an inch and a\r\nhalf in breadth, irregular, but situated, in great measure, on the right\r\nside of the body. Stretching towards the upper part of the perineum, it\r\nformed a kind of square, with a small projecting point on the right,\r\nFig. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe mirrors having a value in proportion to the space they occupy, it is\r\nof great importance to attend to all the rows of down-growing hairs,\r\nwhich diminish its extent of surface, whether these tufts are in the\r\nmidst of the mirror, Figs. 45, 46, and 47, or form indentations on its\r\nedges, as in Figs. 42, 44, 45, 46, and 48.\r\n\r\nThese indentations, concealed in part by the folds of the skin, are\r\nsometimes seen with difficulty; but it is important to take them into\r\naccount, since in a great many cows they materially lessen the size of\r\nthe mirror. We often find cows whose milk-mirror at first sight appears\r\nvery large, but which are only medium milkers; and it will usually be\r\nfound that lateral indentations greatly diminish the surface of\r\nup-growing hair. Many errors are committed in estimating the value of\r\nsuch cows, from a want of attention to the real extent of the\r\nmilk-mirror.\r\n\r\nAll the interruptions in the surface of the mirror indicate a diminution\r\nof the quantity of milk, with the exception, however, of small oval or\r\nelliptical plates which are found in the mirror, on the back part of the\r\nudders of the best cows, as in Figs. 29, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, and 40.\r\nThese ovals have a peculiar tint, which is occasioned by the downward\r\ndirection of the hair which forms them. In the best cows these ovals\r\nexist with the lower mirrors very well developed, as in Figs. 29, 30,\r\nand 32.\r\n\r\nIn fine, we should state that in order to determine the extent and\r\nsignificance of a mirror it is necessary to consider the state of the\r\nperineum as to fat, and of the fulness of the udder. In a fat cow, with\r\nan inflated udder, the mirror would appear larger than it really is;\r\nwhilst in a lean cow, with a loose and wrinkled udder, it appears\r\nsmaller. Fat will cover faults, a fact to be kept in mind in selecting a\r\ncow.\r\n\r\nIn bulls, Fig. 51, the mirrors present the same peculiarities as in\r\ncows; but they are less varied in their form, and especially much less\r\nin size. This will easily be understood from the explanation of\r\nmirrors given on a preceding page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nIn calves the mirrors show the shapes they are afterwards to have, only\r\nthey are more contracted, because the parts which they cover are but\r\nslightly developed. They are easily seen after birth; but the hair which\r\nthen covers them is long, coarse, and stiff; and when this hair falls\r\noff, the calf’s mirror will resemble that of the cow, but be of less\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nWith calves, however, it should be stated, in addition to what has\r\nalready been said, that the milk-mirrors are more distinctly recognized\r\non those from cows that are well kept, and that they will generally be\r\nfully developed at two years old. Some changes take place in the course\r\nof years, but the outlines of the mirror appear prominent at the time of\r\nadvanced pregnancy, or, in the case of cows giving milk, at the times\r\nwhen the udder is more distended with milk than at others.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted by Magne appears still further to simplify\r\nthe whole method, and to bring it within the easy reach and\r\ncomprehension of every one who will examine the figures and the\r\nexplanations connected with them. He divides cows, according to the\r\nquantity they give, into four classes: First, the very good; second, the\r\ngood; third, the medium; and fourth, the bad.\r\n\r\nIn the first class he places cows both parts of whose milk-mirror, the\r\nmammary and the perinean, are large, continuous, uniform, covering at\r\nleast a great part of the perineum, the udder, the inner surface of the\r\nthighs, and extending more or less out upon the legs, as in Figs. 29 to\r\n33, with no interruptions, or, if any, small ones, oval in form, and\r\nsituated on the posterior face of the udder, Figs. 29, 30, and 32.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nSuch mirrors are found on most very good cows, but may also be found\r\non cows which can scarcely be called good, and which should be ranked in\r\nthe next class. But cows, whether having very well-developed mirrors or\r\nnot, may be reckoned as very good, and as giving as much milk as is to\r\nbe expected from their size, feed, and the hygienic circumstances in\r\nwhich they are kept, if they present the following characteristics:\r\n\r\nVeins of the perineum large, as if swollen, and visible on the exterior,\r\nas in Figs. 29-32, or which can be easily made to appear by pressing\r\nupon the base of the perineum; veins of the udder large and knotted,\r\nmilk-veins large, often double, equal on both sides, and forming\r\nzig-zags under the belly.\r\n\r\nTo the signs furnished by the veins and by the mirror may be added also\r\nthe following marks: A uniform, very large and yielding udder, shrinking\r\nmuch in milking, and covered with soft skin and fine hair; good\r\nconstitution, full chest, regular appetite, and great propensity to\r\ndrink. Cows rather inclining to be poor than fat. Soft, yielding skin,\r\nshort, fine hair, small head, fine horns, bright, sparkling eye, mild\r\nexpression, feminine look, with a fine neck.\r\n\r\nCows of this first class are very rare. They give, even when small in\r\nsize, from ten to fourteen quarts of milk a day, and the largest sized\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-six quarts a day, and even more. Just after\r\ncalving, if arrived at maturity and fed with good, wholesome, moist food\r\nin sufficient quantity and quality, adapted to promote the secretion of\r\nmilk, they can give about a pint of milk for every ten ounces of hay, or\r\nits equivalent, which they eat.\r\n\r\nThey continue in milk for a long period. The best never go dry, and may\r\nbe milked even up to the time of calving, giving from eight to twelve\r\nquarts of milk a day. The Dutch cow, Fig. 54, was giving daily\r\ntwenty-two quarts of milk, a year after calving. But even the best cows\r\noften fall short of the quantity of milk they are able to give, from\r\nbeing fed on food that is too dry, or not sufficiently varied, or not\r\nrich enough in nutritive qualities, or deficient in quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nThe second class is that of _good cows_; and to this belong the best\r\ncommonly found in the market and among the cow-feeders of cities.\r\n\r\nThey have the mammary part of the milk-mirror well developed, but the\r\nperinean part contracted or wholly wanting, as in Figs. 34 and 37; or\r\nboth parts of the mirror are moderately developed, or slightly indented,\r\nas Figs. 35 and 36. Figs. 38, 39, 40, and 41, belong also to this class,\r\nin the lower part; but they denote cows which, as the upper mirrors, S S\r\nS, indicate, dry up sooner when again in calf.\r\n\r\nThese marks, though often seen on many good cows, should be considered\r\nas certain only when the veins of the perineum form, under the skin, a\r\nkind of network, which, without being very apparent, may be felt by a\r\npressure on them; when the milk-veins on the belly are well developed,\r\nthough less knotted and less prominent than in cows of the first class;\r\nin fine, when the udder is well developed, and presents veins which are\r\nsufficiently numerous, though not very large.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, then, as in the preceding class, to have a mistrust of\r\ncows in which the mirror is not accompanied by large veins. This remark\r\napplies especially to cows which have had several calves, and are in\r\nfull milk. They are medium or bad, let the milk-mirror be what it may,\r\nif the veins of the belly are not large, and those of the udder\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics which depend on form and constitution\r\ncombine less than in cows of the preceding class the marks of good\r\nhealth and excellent constitution with those of a gentle and feminine\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. A Good Milch Cow.]\r\n\r\nSmall cows of this class give from seven to ten or eleven quarts of milk\r\na day, and the largest from thirteen to seventeen quarts. They can be\r\nmade to give three fourths of a pint of milk, just after calving, for\r\nevery ten ounces of hay consumed, if well cared for, and fed in a manner\r\nfavorable to the secretion of milk.\r\n\r\nThey hold out long in milk when they have no upper mirrors or tufts. At\r\nseven or eight months in calf, they may give from five to eight quarts a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe third class consists of _middling cows_. When the milk-mirror really\r\npresents only the lower or mammary part slightly developed or indented,\r\nand the perinean part contracted, narrow, and irregular, as in Figs. 42\r\nto 47, the cows are middling. The udder is slightly developed or hard,\r\nand shrinks very little after milking. The veins of the perineum are not\r\napparent, and those which run along the lower sides of the abdomen are\r\nsmall, straight, and sometimes unequal. In this case the mirror is not\r\nsymmetrical, and the cow gives more milk on the side where the vein is\r\nlargest.\r\n\r\nThese cows often have large heads, and a thick and hard skin. Being\r\nordinarily in good condition, and even fat, they are beautiful to look\r\nat, and seem to be well formed. Many of them are nervous and restive,\r\nand not easily approached.\r\n\r\nCows of this class give, according to size, from three or four to ten\r\nquarts of milk. They very rarely give, even in the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, half a pint for every ten ounces of hay which they\r\nconsume.\r\n\r\nThe milk diminishes rapidly, and dries up wholly the fourth or fifth\r\nmonth in calf.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class is composed of _bad cows_. As they are ordinarily in\r\ngood condition, these cows are often the most beautiful of the herd and\r\nin the markets. They have fleshy thighs, thick and hard skin, a large\r\nand coarse neck and head, and horns large at the base.\r\n\r\nThe udder is hard, small, and fleshy, with a skin covered with long,\r\nrough hair. No veins are to be seen either on the perineum or the udder,\r\nwhile those of the belly are very slightly developed, and the mirrors\r\nare ordinarily small, as in Figs. 48, 49, and 50.\r\n\r\nWith these characteristics, cows give only a few quarts of milk a day,\r\nand dry up a short time after calving. Some such can scarcely nourish\r\ntheir calves, even when they are well cared for and well fed.\r\n\r\nSickly habits, chronic affections of the digestive organs, the chest,\r\nthe womb, and the lacteal system, sometimes greatly affect the milk\r\nsecretions, and cause cows troubled with them to fall from the first or\r\nsecond to the third, and sometimes to the fourth class.\r\n\r\nThe above classification is very similar to that of Pabst, a German\r\nfarmer of large experience and observation of stock, who, with a view to\r\nsimplify the method of Guénon, and render it of greater practical value\r\nto the farmer, made five divisions or classes, consisting of, 1st, _Very\r\ngood_ or _extraordinary_; 2d, _Good_ or _good middling_; 3d, _Middling_\r\nand _little below middling_; 4th, _Small_; and, 5th, _Very bad milkers_.\r\n\r\nThese classifications, adopted by Magne, Pabst, and other good breeders\r\nand judges of cows, appear to me to be far more simple and satisfactory\r\nthan the more extended and complicated classification of Guénon himself.\r\nWithout pretending to be able to judge with any accuracy of the\r\nquantity, the quality, or the duration, which any particular size or\r\nform of the mirror will indicate, they give to Guénon the full credit of\r\nhis important discovery of the escutcheon, or milk-mirror, as a new and\r\nvery valuable element in forming our judgment of the milking qualities\r\nof a cow; and simply assert, with respect to the duration or continuance\r\nof the flow of milk, that the mirror that indicates the greatest\r\nquantity will also indicate the longest duration. The mirror forms, in\r\nother words, an important additional mark or point for distinguishing\r\ngood milkers; and it is safe to lay it down as a rule that, in the\r\nselection of milch cows, as well as in the choice of young animals as\r\nbreeders, we should, by all means, examine and consider the milk-mirror,\r\nbut not limit or confine ourselves exclusively to it, and that other and\r\nlong-known marks should be equally regarded.\r\n\r\nBut there are cases where a knowledge and careful examination of the\r\nform and size of the mirror becomes of the greatest importance. It is\r\nwell known that certain signs or marks of great milkers are developed\r\nonly as the capacities of the animal herself are fully and completely\r\ndeveloped by age. The milk-veins, for instance, are never so large and\r\nprominent in heifers and young cows as in old ones, and the same may be\r\nsaid of the udder, and the veins of the udder and perineum; all of which\r\nit is of great importance to observe in the selection of milch cows.\r\nThose signs, then, which in cows arrived at maturity are almost\r\nsufficient in themselves to warrant a conclusion as to their merits as\r\nmilkers, are, to a great extent, wanting in younger animals, and\r\naltogether in calves, of which there is often doubt whether they shall\r\nbe raised; and here a knowledge of the form of the mirror is of immense\r\nadvantage, since it gives, at the outset, and before any expense is\r\nincurred, a somewhat reliable means of judging of the future milking\r\ncapacities of the animal or, if a male, of the probability of his\r\ntransmitting milking qualities to his offspring.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from an examination of the points of a good milch cow,\r\nthat, though the same marks which indicate the greatest milking\r\nqualities may not indicate any great aptitude to fatten, yet that the\r\nsigns which indicate good fattening qualities are included among the\r\nsigns favorable to the production of milk, such as soundness of\r\nconstitution, indicated by good organs of digestion and respiration,\r\nfineness and mellowness of the skin and hair, quietness of disposition,\r\nwhich inclines the animal to rest and lie down in chewing the cud, and\r\nother marks which are relied on by graziers in selecting animals to\r\nfatten.\r\n\r\nIn buying dairy stock the farmer generally finds it for his interest to\r\nselect young heifers. They give the promise of longer usefulness. But it\r\nis often the case that older cows are selected with the design of using\r\nthem for the dairy for a limited period, and then feeding them for the\r\nbutcher. In either case, it is advisable, as a rule, to choose animals\r\nin low or medium condition. The farmer cannot ordinarily afford to buy\r\nfat; it is more properly his business to make it, and to have it to\r\nsell. Good and well-marked cows in poor condition will rapidly gain in\r\nflesh and products when removed to better pastures and higher keeping,\r\nand they cost less in the original purchase.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that regard should be had to the quality of the\r\npasturage and keeping which a cow has previously had, as compared with\r\nthat to which she is to be subjected. The size of the animal should also\r\nbe considered with reference to the fertility of the pastures into which\r\nshe is to be put. Small or medium-sized animals accommodate themselves\r\nto ordinary pastures far better than large ones. Where a very large cow\r\nwill do well, two small ones will usually do better, while the large\r\nanimal might fail entirely where two small ones would do well. It is\r\nbetter to have the whole herd, so far as may be, uniform in size; for,\r\nif they vary greatly, some may get more than they need, and others will\r\nnot have enough. This however, cannot always be brought about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. A Good Dairy Cow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFEEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY COWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo branch of dairy farming can compare in importance with the management\r\nof cows. The highest success will depend very much upon it, whatever\r\nbreed be selected, and whatever amount of care and attention be given to\r\nthe points of the animals; for experience will show that very little\r\nmilk comes out of the bag that is not first put into the throat. It is\r\npoor economy, therefore, to attempt to keep too many cows for the amount\r\nof feed we have; for it will generally be found that one good cow well\r\nbred and well fed will yield as much as two ordinary cows kept in the\r\nordinary way, while a saving is effected both in labor and room\r\nrequired, and in the risks on the capital invested. If the larger number\r\non poorer feed is urged for the sake of the manure, which is the only\r\nground on which it can be put, it is sufficient to remark that it is a\r\nvery expensive way of making manure. It is not too much to say that a\r\nproper regard to profit and economy would require many an American\r\nfarmer to sell off nearly half his cows, and to feed the whole of his\r\nhay and roots hitherto used into the remainder.\r\n\r\nA certain German farmer was visited, one day, by some Swiss from over\r\nthe border, who desired to buy of him all the milk of his cows for the\r\npurpose of making cheese. Not being able to agree upon the terms, he\r\nfinally proposed to let them take the entire charge of his cows, and\r\nagreed to furnish food amply sufficient, the Swiss assuming the whole\r\ncare of feeding it out, and paying a fixed price by measure for all the\r\nmilk. “I found myself, at once,” says he, “under the necessity of\r\nselling almost half my cows, because the Swiss required nearly double\r\nthe quantity of fodder which the cows had previously had, and I was well\r\nsatisfied that all the produce I could raise on my farm would be far\r\nfrom sufficient to feed in that way the number of cows I had kept. I was\r\nin despair at finding them using such a quantity of the best quality of\r\nfeed, though it was according to the strict letter of the contract,\r\nespecially as I knew that I had given my cows rather more than the\r\nquantity of food recommended by men in whom I had perfect confidence.\r\nThus, while Thaër names twenty-three pounds of hay, or its equivalent,\r\nas food sufficient for a good-sized cow, I gave mine full twenty-seven\r\npounds. But, if the change effected in the management of my cows was\r\ngreat, the result was still more striking. The quantity of milk kept\r\nincreasing, and it reached the highest point when the cows attained the\r\ncondition of the fat kine of Pharaoh’s dream. The quantity of milk\r\nbecame double, triple, and even quadruple, what it had been before; so\r\nthat, if I should compare the product with that previously obtained, a\r\nhundred pounds of hay produced three times more milk than it had\r\nproduced with my old mode of feeding. Such results, of course, attracted\r\nmy attention to this branch of my farming. It became a matter of\r\npleasure; and my observations were followed up with great care, and\r\nduring several years I devoted a large part of my time to it. I even\r\nwent so far as to procure scales for weighing the food and the animals,\r\nin order to establish exact data on the most positive basis.”\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to which he arrived were, that an animal, to be fully\r\nfed and satisfied, requires a quantity of food in proportion to its live\r\nweight; that no feed could be complete that did not contain a sufficient\r\namount of nutritive elements; hay, for example, being more nutritive\r\nthan straw, and grains than roots. He found, too, that the food must\r\npossess a bulk sufficient to fill up to a certain degree the organs of\r\ndigestion or the stomach; and that, to receive the full benefit of its\r\nfood, the animal must be wholly satisfied, as, if the stomach is not\r\nsufficiently distended, the food cannot be properly digested, and of\r\ncourse many of the nutritive principles it contains would not be\r\nperfectly assimilated. An animal regularly fed eats till it is\r\nsatisfied, and no more than is requisite. A part of the nutritive\r\nelements in hay and other forage plants is needed to keep an animal on\r\nits feet,--that is, to keep up its condition,--and if the nutrition of\r\nits food is not sufficient for this the weight decreases, and if it is\r\nmore than sufficient the weight increases, or else this excess is\r\nconsumed in the production of milk or in labor. About one sixtieth of\r\ntheir live weight in hay, or its equivalent, will keep horned cattle on\r\ntheir feet; but, in order to be completely nourished, they require about\r\none thirtieth in dry substances, and four thirtieths in water, or other\r\nliquid contained in their food. The excess of nutritive food over and\r\nabove what is required to sustain life will go in milch cows generally\r\nto the production of milk, or to the growth of the fœtus, but not in all\r\ncows to an equal extent; the tendency to the secretion of milk being far\r\nmore developed in some than in others.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the consumption of food in proportion to the live weight\r\nof the animal, however far it may apply as a general principle, it\r\nshould, I think, be taken with some qualifications. The proportion is\r\nprobably not uniform as applied to all breeds indiscriminately, though\r\nit may be more so as applied to animals of the same breed. Bakewell’s\r\nidea was that the quantity of food required depended much on the shape\r\nof the barrel; and it is well known that an animal of a close, compact,\r\nwell-rounded barrel will consume less than one of an opposite make.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the yield of milch cows are caused more by the\r\nvariations in the nutritive elements of their food than by a change of\r\nthe form in which it is given. “A cow, kept through the winter on mere\r\nstraw,” says a practical writer on this subject, “will cease to give\r\nmilk; and, when fed in spring on green forage, will give a fair quantity\r\nof milk. But she owes the cessation and restoration of the secretion to\r\nrespectively the diminution and the increase of her nourishment, and not\r\nat all to the change of form, or of outward substance, in which the\r\nnourishment is administered. Let cows receive through winter nearly as\r\nlarge a proportion of nutritive matter as is contained in the clover,\r\nlucerne, and fresh grasses, which they eat in summer, and, no matter in\r\nwhat precise substance or mixture that matter may be contained, they\r\nwill yield a winter’s produce of milk quite as rich in caseine and\r\nbutyraceous ingredients as the summer’s produce, and far more ample in\r\nquantity than almost any dairyman with old-fashioned notions would\r\nimagine to be possible. The great practical error on this subject\r\nconsists not in giving wrong kinds of food, but in not so proportioning\r\nand preparing it as to render an average ration of it equally rich in\r\nthe elements of nutrition, and especially in nitrogenous elements, as an\r\naverage ration of the green and succulent food of summer.”\r\n\r\nWe keep too much stock for the quantity of good and nutritious food\r\nwhich we have for it; and the consequence is cows are, in nine cases out\r\nof ten, poorly wintered, and come out in the spring weakened, if not,\r\nindeed, positively diseased, and a long time is required to bring them\r\ninto a condition to yield a generous quantity of milk.\r\n\r\nIt is a hard struggle for a cow reduced in flesh and in blood to fill up\r\nthe wasted system with the food which would otherwise have gone to the\r\nsecretion of milk; but, if she is well fed, well housed, well littered,\r\nand well supplied with pure, fresh water, and with roots, or other\r\n_moist_ food, and properly treated to the luxury of a frequent carding,\r\nand constant kindness, she comes out ready to commence the manufacture\r\nof milk under favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Keep the cows constantly in good condition_, ought, therefore, to be\r\nthe motto of every dairy farmer, posted up over the barn-door, and over\r\nthe stalls, and over the milk-room, and repeated to the boys whenever\r\nthere is danger of forgetting it. It is the great secret of success, and\r\nthe difference between success and failure turns upon it. Cows in milk\r\nrequire more food in proportion to their size and weight than either\r\noxen or young cattle.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep cows in milk well and economically, regularity is next\r\nin importance to a full supply of wholesome and nutritious food. The\r\nhealthy animal stomach is a very nice chronometer, and it is of the\r\nutmost importance to observe regular hours in feeding, cleaning, and\r\nmilking. This is a point, also, in which very many farmers are at\r\nfault--feeding whenever it happens to be convenient. The cattle are thus\r\nkept in a restless condition, constantly expecting food when the keeper\r\nenters the barn, while, if regular hours are strictly adhered to, they\r\nknow exactly when they are to be fed, and they rest quietly till the\r\ntime arrives. Go into a well-regulated dairy establishment an hour\r\nbefore the time of feeding, and scarcely an animal will rise to its\r\nfeet; while, if it happens to be the hour of feeding, the whole herd\r\nwill be likely to rise and seize their food with an avidity and relish\r\nnot to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the exact routine to be pursued, no rule could be\r\nprescribed which would apply to all cases; and each individual must be\r\ngoverned much by circumstances, both in respect to the particular kinds\r\nof feed at different seasons of the year, and the system of feeding. I\r\nhave found in my own practice, and in the practice of the most\r\nsuccessful dairymen, that, in order to encourage the largest secretion\r\nof milk in stalled cows, one of the best courses is, to feed in the\r\nmorning, either at the time of milking--which I prefer--or immediately\r\nafter, with cut feed, consisting of hay, oats, millet, or corn-stalks,\r\nmixed with shorts, and Indian, linseed, or cotton-seed meal, thoroughly\r\nmoistened with water. If in winter, hot or warm water is far better than\r\ncold. If given at milking-time, the cows will generally give down the\r\nmilk more readily. The stalls and mangers ought always to be well\r\ncleaned out first.\r\n\r\nRoots and long hay may be given during the day; and at the evening\r\nmilking, or directly after, another generous meal of cut feed, well\r\nmoistened and mixed, as in the morning. No very concentrated food, like\r\ngrains alone or oil-cakes, should, it seems to me, be fed early in the\r\nmorning on an empty stomach, though it is sanctioned by the practice in\r\nthe London milk-dairies. The processes of digestion go on best when the\r\nstomach is sufficiently distended; and for this purpose the bulk of food\r\nis almost as important as the nutritive qualities. The flavor of some\r\nroots, as cabbages and turnips, is more apt to be imparted to the flesh\r\nand milk when fed on an empty stomach than otherwise. After the cows\r\nhave been milked, and have finished their cut feed, they are carded and\r\ncurried down, in well-managed dairies, and then either watered in the\r\nstall, which in very cold or stormy weather is far preferable, or turned\r\nout to water in the yard. When they are out, if they are let out at all,\r\nthe stables are put in order; and, after tying them up, they are fed\r\nwith long hay, and left to themselves till the time of next feeding.\r\nThis may consist of roots, such as cabbages, beets, carrots, or turnips,\r\nsliced, or of potatoes, a peck, or, if the cows are very large, a\r\nhalf-bushel each, and cut feed again at the evening milking, as in the\r\nmorning, after which water in the stall, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe less cows are exposed to the cold of winter, the better. They eat\r\nless, thrive better, and give more milk, when kept housed all the time,\r\nthan when exposed to the cold. Caird mentions a case where a herd of\r\ncows, which had been usually supplied from troughs and pipes in the\r\nstalls, were, on account of an obstruction in the pipes, obliged to be\r\nturned out twice a day to be watered in the yard. The quantity of milk\r\ninstantly decreased, and in three days the falling off became very\r\nconsiderable. After the pipes were mended, and the cows again watered as\r\nbefore, in their stalls, the flow of milk returned. This, however, will\r\nbe governed much by the weather; for in very mild, warm days it may be\r\njudicious not only to let them out, but to allow them to remain out for\r\na short time, to exercise.\r\n\r\nAny one can arrange the hour for the several processes named above, to\r\nsuit himself; but, when once fixed, let it be rigidly and regularly\r\nfollowed. If the regular and full feeding be neglected for even a day,\r\nthe yield of milk will immediately decline, and it will be very\r\ndifficult to restore it. It may safely be asserted, as the result of\r\nmany trials and long practice, that a larger flow of milk follows a\r\ncomplete system of regularity in this respect than from a higher feeding\r\nwhere this system is not adhered to.\r\n\r\nOne prime object which the dairyman should keep constantly in view is,\r\nto maintain the animal in a sound and healthy condition. Without this,\r\nno profit can be expected from a milch cow for any considerable length\r\nof time; and, with a view to this, there should be an occasional change\r\nof food. But, in making changes, great care is required to supply an\r\nequal amount of nourishment, or the cow falls off in flesh, and\r\neventually in milk. We should therefore bear in mind that the food\r\nconsumed goes not alone to the secretion of milk, but also to the growth\r\nand maintenance of the bony structure, the flesh, the blood, the fat,\r\nthe skin, and the hair, and in exhalations from the body. These parts of\r\nthe body consist of different organic constituents. Some are rich in\r\nnitrogen, as the fibrin of the blood, albumen, &c.; others destitute of\r\nit, as fat; some abound in inorganic salts, phosphate of lime, salts of\r\npotash, &c. To explain how the constant waste of these substances may be\r\nsupplied, Dr. Voelcker observes that the albumen, gluten, caseine, and\r\nother nitrogenized principles of food, supply the animal with materials\r\nrequired for the formation of muscle and cartilage; they are, therefore,\r\ncalled flesh-forming principles.\r\n\r\n“Fats, or oily matters of the food,” says he, “are used to lay on fat,\r\nor for the purpose of sustaining respiration.\r\n\r\n“Starch, sugar, gum, and a few other non-nitrogenized substances,\r\nconsisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, supply the carbon given off\r\nin respiration, or they are used for the production of fat.\r\n\r\n“Phosphates of lime and magnesia in food principally furnish the animal\r\nwith the materials of which the bony skeleton of its body consists.\r\n\r\n“Saline substances--chlorides of sodium and potassium, sulphate and\r\nphosphate of potash and soda, and some other mineral matters occurring\r\nin food--supply the blood, juice of flesh, and various animal juices,\r\nwith the necessary mineral constituents.\r\n\r\n“The healthy state of an animal can thus only be preserved by a mixed\r\nfood; that is, food which contains all the proximate principles just\r\nnoticed. Starch or sugar alone cannot sustain the animal body, because\r\nneither of them furnishes the materials to build up the fleshy parts of\r\nthe animal. When fed on substances in which an insufficient quantity of\r\nphosphates occurs, the animal will become weak, because it does not find\r\nany bone-producing principles in its food. Due attention, therefore,\r\nought to be paid by the feeder to the selection of food which contains\r\nall the kinds of matter required, nitrogenized as well as\r\nnon-nitrogenized, and mineral substances; and these should be mixed\r\ntogether in the proportion which experience points out as best for the\r\ndifferent kinds of animals, or the particular purpose for which they are\r\nkept.”\r\n\r\n“On the nutrition of cows for dairy purposes,” Dr. Voelcker still\r\nfurther observes that “milk may be regarded as a material for the\r\nmanufacture of butter or of cheese; and, according to the purpose for\r\nwhich the milk is intended to be employed, whether for the manufacture\r\nof butter or the production of cheese, the cow should be differently\r\nfed.\r\n\r\n“Butter contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and no nitrogen. Cheese,\r\non the contrary, is rich in nitrogen. Food which contains much fatty\r\nmatter, or substances which in the animal system are readily converted\r\ninto fat, will tend to increase the proportion of cream in milk. On the\r\nother hand, the proportion of caseine or cheesy matter in milk is\r\nincreased by the use of highly nitrogenized food. Those, therefore, who\r\ndesire much cream, or who produce milk for the manufacture of butter,\r\nselect food likely to increase the proportion of butter in the milk. On\r\nthe contrary, where the principal object is the production of milk rich\r\nin curd,--that is, where cheese is the object of the farmer,--clover,\r\npeas, and bean-meal, and other plants which abound in legumine,--a\r\nnitrogenized organic compound, almost identical in properties and\r\ncomposition with caseine, or the substance which forms the curd of\r\nmilk,--will be selected.” And so the quality, as well as the quantity,\r\nof butter in the milk, depends on the kind of food consumed, and on the\r\ngeneral health of the animal. Cows fed on turnips in the stall always\r\nproduce butter inferior to that of cows living upon the fresh and\r\naromatic grasses of the pastures.\r\n\r\nSucculent food in which water abounds--the green grass of irrigated\r\nmeadows, green clover, brewers’ refuse, distillers’ refuse,\r\netc.--increases the quantity, rather than the quality, of the milk; and\r\nby feeding these substances the milk-dairyman studies his own interest,\r\nand makes thin milk, without diluting it with water, though, in the\r\nopinion of some, this may be no more legitimate than watering the milk.\r\n\r\nBut, though the yield of milk may be increased by succulent or watery\r\nfood, it should be given so as not to interfere with the health of the\r\ncow.\r\n\r\nFood rich in starch, gum, or sugar, which are the respiratory elements,\r\nan excess of which goes to the production of fatty matters, increases\r\nthe butter in milk. Quietness promotes the secretion of fat in animals\r\nand increases the butter. Cheese will be increased by food rich in\r\nalbumen, such as the leguminous plants.\r\n\r\nThe most natural, and of course the healthiest food for milch cows in\r\nsummer, is the green grass of the pastures; and when those fail from\r\ndrought, or over-stocking, the complement of nourishment may be made up\r\nwith green clover, green oats, barley, millet, or corn-fodder, and\r\ncabbage-leaves, or other succulent vegetables; and if these are wanting,\r\ntheir place may be partly supplied with shorts, Indian-meal, linseed or\r\ncotton-seed meal. Green grass is more nutritious than hay, which always\r\nloses more or less of its nutritive qualities in curing; the amount of\r\nthe loss depending chiefly on the mode of curing, and the length of\r\nexposure to sun and rain. But, apart from this, grass is more easily and\r\ncompletely digested than hay, though the digestion of hay may be greatly\r\naided by cutting and moistening, or steaming; and by this means it is\r\nrendered more readily available, and hence far better adapted to promote\r\na large secretion of milk--a fact too often overlooked by many even\r\nintelligent farmers.\r\n\r\nThat green grass is better adapted than most other kinds of food to\r\npromote a large flow of milk, may be seen from the following table, from\r\nwhich it will appear that greater attention should be given to the\r\nproper constituents of food for milch cows. Two cows were taken in the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+---------+-----------+\r\n  |                             |Milk in |  Butter |Nitrogen in|\r\n  |                             |  five  | in five |  food in  |\r\n  |      Food of two cows.      |  days. |   days. | five days.|\r\n  +-----------------------------+--------+---------+-----------+\r\n  |1.

Towards the middle of autumn,\r\nthe cows fed in the pastures will require to be housed regularly nights,\r\nespecially in the more northern latitudes, and put, in part at least,\r\nupon hay. But every farmer knows that it is not judicious to feed out\r\nthe best part of his hay when his cattle are first put into the barn,\r\nand that he should not feed so well in the early part of winter that he\r\ncannot feed better as it advances.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should always be borne in mind that the change from\r\ngrass to a poor quality of hay or straw, for cows in milk, should not be\r\ntoo sudden. A poor quality of dry hay is far less palatable in the early\r\npart of winter, after the cows are taken from grass, than at a later\r\nperiod; and, if it is resorted to with milch cows, will inevitably lead\r\nto a falling off in the milk, which no good feed can afterwards wholly\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable, therefore, to know what can be used instead of his best\r\nEnglish or upland meadow hay, and yet not suffer any greater loss in the\r\nflow of milk, or condition, than is absolutely necessary. In some\r\nsections of New England, the best quality of swale hay will be used; and\r\nthe composition of that is as variable as possible, depending on the\r\nvarieties of grasses of which it was made, and the manner of curing.\r\nBut, in other sections, many will find it necessary to use straw, and\r\nother substitutes; and it may be desirable to know how much is required\r\nto form an equivalent in nutrition to good meadow or English hay. The\r\nfollowing brief table of nutritive equivalents will be convenient for\r\nreference:\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-----------+-----------------\r\n                    |           |    Percentage\r\n                    |           |   of Nitrogen.\r\n                    | Nutritive +--------+--------\r\n                    |equivalent.| Dried. |Undried.\r\n                    +-----------+--------+--------\r\n  1.

Hay cut and thoroughly\r\nmoistened becomes more succulent and nutritive, and partakes more of the\r\nnature of green grass.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for the oil-cake, hitherto known as an exceedingly\r\nvaluable article for feeding stock, there is probably nothing better\r\nthan cotton-seed meal, now to be had in large quantities in the market.\r\nThis is an article whose economic value has been but recently made\r\nknown, but which, from practical trials already made, has proved\r\neminently successful as food for milch cows. An average specimen of this\r\nwas submitted for analysis to Professor Johnson, who reported that its\r\ncomposition is not inferior to that of the best flax-seed cake, and that\r\nin some respects its agricultural value surpasses that of any other kind\r\nof oil-cake, as is shown in the following table, containing in column\r\nfirst the analysis of cotton-seed meal made by himself; in column\r\nsecond, some of the results obtained by Dr. C. T. Jackson on cake\r\nprepared by himself from hulled cotton-seed; in column third, an\r\nanalysis of cotton-seed cake, made by Dr. Anderson, of Edinburgh; in\r\ncolumn fourth, the average composition of eight samples of American\r\nlinseed-cake; and in column fifth, an analysis of meadow hay, obtained\r\nby Dr. Wolff in Saxony, given as a means of comparison.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                             |  I.  |  II. | III. |  IV. |  V.\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  Water,                     |  6.82|      | 11.19|  9.23| 16.94\r\n  Oil,                       | 16.47|   -  |  9.08| 12.96|   -\r\n  Albuminous bodies,         | 44.41| 48.82| 25.16| 28.28| 10.69\r\n  Mucilaginous and Saccharine|}12.74|}     |      | 34.22| 40.11\r\n   matters,                  |}     |} ... | 48.93|      |\r\n  Fibre,                     | 11.76|}     |      |  9.00| 27.16\r\n  Ash,                       |  7.80|  8.96|  5.64|  6.21|  5.04\r\n                             +------+      +------+------+------\r\n                             |100.00|      |100.00|100.00|100.00\r\n                             |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Nitrogen,                  |  7.05|  7.75|  3.95|  4.47|   -\r\n  Phosphoric acid in ash,    |  2.36|  2.45|   -  |   -  |   -\r\n  Sand,                      |   .94|   -  |  1.32|   -  |   -\r\n  ---------------------------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nJohnson also remarks, in this connection, that the great value of\r\nlinseed-cake, as an adjunct to hay for fat cattle and milch cows, has\r\nlong been recognized; and is undeniably traceable in the main to three\r\ningredients of the seeds of the oil-yielding plants. The value of food\r\ndepends upon the quantity of matters it contains which may be\r\nappropriated by the animal which consumes the food. Now, it is proved\r\nthat the fat of animals is derivable from the _starch_, _gum_, and\r\n_sugar_, and more directly and easily from the _oil_ of the food. These\r\nfour substances are, then, the _fat-formers_. The muscles, nerves, and\r\ntendons of animals, the fibrine of their blood, and the curd of their\r\nmilk, are almost identical in composition, and strongly similar in many\r\nof their properties with matters found in all vegetables, but chiefly in\r\nsuch as form the most concentrated food. These _blood_ (and muscle)\r\n_formers_ are characterized by containing about fifteen and a half per\r\ncent. of nitrogen; and hence are called _nitrogenous substances_. They\r\nare also often designated as the _albuminous bodies_.\r\n\r\nThe bony framework of the animal owes its solidity to _phosphate of\r\nlime_, and this substance must be furnished by the food. A perfect food\r\nmust supply the animal with these three classes of bodies, and in proper\r\nproportions. The addition of a small quantity of a food rich in oil and\r\nalbuminous substances to the ordinary kinds of feed, which contain a\r\nlarge quantity of vegetable fibre or woody matter, more or less\r\nindigestible, but nevertheless indispensable to the herbivorous animals,\r\ntheir digestive organs being adapted to a bulky food, has been found\r\nhighly advantageous in practice. Neither hay alone nor concentrated food\r\nalone gives the best results. A certain combination of the two presents\r\nthe most advantages.\r\n\r\nA Bavarian farmer has recently announced that heifers fed, for three\r\nmonths before calving, with a little linseed-cake, in addition to their\r\nother fodder, acquire a larger development of the milk-vessels, and\r\nyield more milk afterwards, than similar animals fed as usual.\r\nCotton-seed cake must have an equally good effect.\r\n\r\nSome of those who have used cotton-seed cake have found difficulty in\r\ninducing cattle to eat it. By giving it at first in small doses, mixed\r\nwith other palatable food, they soon learn to eat it with relish.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the analyses II. and I. with the average composition of\r\nlinseed-cake IV., it will be seen that the cotton-seed cake is much\r\nricher in oil and albuminous matters than the linseed-cake. A\r\ncorrespondingly less quantity will therefore be required. Three pounds\r\nof this cotton-seed cake are equivalent to four of linseed-cake of\r\naverage quality.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season, as already remarked, a frequent change of food\r\nis especially necessary, both as contributing to the general health of\r\nanimals, and as a means of stimulating the digestive organs, and thus\r\nincreasing the secretion of milk. A mixture used as cut feed, and well\r\nmoistened, is now especially beneficial, since concentrated food, which\r\nwould otherwise be given in small quantities, may be united with larger\r\nquantities of coarser and less nutritive food, and the complete\r\nassimilation of the whole be better secured. On this subject Dr.\r\nVoelcker truly observes that the most nutritious kinds of food produce\r\nlittle or no effect when they are not digested by the stomach, or if the\r\ndigested food is not absorbed by the lymphatic vessels, and not\r\nassimilated by the various parts of the body. Now, the normal functions\r\nof the digestive organs not only depend on the composition of the food,\r\nbut also on its volume. The volume or bulk of the food contributes to\r\nthe healthy activity of the digestive organs, by exercising a\r\nstimulating effect on the nerves which govern them. Thus the whole\r\norganization of ruminating animals necessitates the supply of bulky\r\nfood, to keep the animal in good condition.\r\n\r\nFeed sweet and nutritious food, therefore, regularly, frequently, and in\r\nsmall quantities, and change it often, and the best results may be\r\nconfidently expected. If the cows are not in milk, but are to come in in\r\nthe spring, the difference in feeding should be rather in the quantity\r\nthan the quality, if the highest yield is to be expected from them the\r\ncoming season.\r\n\r\nThe most common feeding is hay alone, and oftentimes very poor hay, at\r\nthat. The main point is to keep the animal in a healthy and thriving\r\ncondition, and not to suffer her to fail in flesh; and with this object\r\nsome change and variety of food is highly important. And here it may be\r\nremarked that cows in calf should not, as a general rule, be milked the\r\nlast month or six weeks before calving, and many prefer to have them run\r\ndry as many as eight or ten weeks. The yield of milk is better the\r\ncoming season, and holds out better, than if they are milked up to the\r\ntime of calving.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions, however, and it is often very difficult to dry off\r\na cow sufficiently to make it judicious to cease milking much, if any,\r\nbefore the time of calving. Some even prefer to milk quite up to this\r\ntime; but the weight of authority among the best practical farmers is so\r\ndecidedly against it, that there can be no question of its bad economy.\r\nTowards the close of winter, a herd of cows will begin to come in, or\r\napproach their time of calving. Care should then be taken not to feed\r\ntoo rich or stimulating food for the last week or two before this event,\r\nas it is often attended with ill consequences. A plenty of hay, a few\r\npotatoes or shorts, and pure water, will be sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs the time of calving approaches, the cow should be removed from the\r\nrest of the herd, to a pen with a level floor, by herself. Nothing is\r\nneeded, usually, but to supply her regularly with food and drink, and\r\nleave her quietly to herself. In most cases the parturition will be\r\nnatural and easy, and the less the cow is disturbed or meddled with, the\r\nbetter. She will do better without help than with; but she should be\r\nwatched, in order to see that no difficulty occurs which may require aid\r\nand attention. In cases of difficult parturition the aid of a skilful\r\nveterinary surgeon may be required. For those who may desire to make\r\nthemselves familiar with the details of such cases so far as to be able\r\nto act for themselves, Skellett’s “Practical Treatise on the Parturition\r\nof the Cow, or the Extraction of the Calf,” an elaborate work, published\r\nin London in 1844, will be an important guide.\r\n\r\nIn spring the best feeding for dairy cows will be much the same as that\r\nfor winter; the roots in store over winter, such as carrots, mangold\r\nwurzel, turnips, and parsnips, furnishing very valuable aid in\r\nincreasing the quantity and improving the quality of milk. Towards the\r\nclose of this season, and before the grass of the pastures is\r\nsufficiently grown to make it judicious to turn out the cows, the best\r\ndairymen provide a supply of green fodder in the shape of winter rye,\r\nwhich, if cut while it is tender and succulent, and before it is half\r\ngrown, will be greatly relished. Unless cut young, however, its stalk\r\nsoon becomes hard and unpalatable.\r\n\r\nHaving stated briefly the general principles of feeding cows for the\r\ndairy, it is proper to give the statements of successful practical\r\ndairymen, both as corroborating what has already been said, and as\r\nshowing the difference in practice in feeding and managing with\r\nreference to the specific objects of dairy farming. And first, a farmer\r\nof Massachusetts, supplying milk for the Boston market, and feeding for\r\nthat object, says: “For thirty cows, cut with a machine thirty bushels\r\nfor one feed; one third common English hay, one third salt hay, and one\r\nthird rye or barley straw; add thirty quarts of wheat bran or shorts,\r\nand ten quarts of oat and corn meal moistened with water. One bushel of\r\nthis mixture is given to each cow in the morning, and the same quantity\r\nat noon and in the evening. In addition to this, a peck of mangold\r\nwurzel is given to each cow per day. This mode of feeding has been found\r\nto produce nearly as much milk as the best grass feed in summer. When no\r\nwheat-bran or any kind of meal is given, the hay is fed without\r\ncutting.”\r\n\r\nAnother excellent farmer, of the western part of the same state,\r\ndevoting his attention to the manufacture of cheese, and the successful\r\ncompetitor for the first prize of the state society for dairies, says of\r\nhis feeding: “My pastures are upland, and yield sweet feed. I fed, in\r\nthe month of June, all the whey from the milk made into cheese, without\r\nany meal. In September, my pastures being very much dried up, I fed all\r\nthe whey, with one quart of meal to each cow, and also ten pounds of\r\ncorn fodder to each cow per day.\r\n\r\n“I commence feeding my cows in the spring, before calving, with three\r\nquarts of meal each per day, until the feed in the pasture is good.\r\n\r\n“I consider the best mixture of grain, ground into meal, for milk, is\r\nequal quantities of rye, buckwheat, and oats. For the last ten years I\r\nhave not made less than five hundred pounds of cheese and twenty pounds\r\nof butter to each cow; and one year I made six hundred and forty pounds\r\nof cheese and twenty pounds of butter to each cow.\r\n\r\n“A cow will give more milk on good fresh grass than any other feed. When\r\nthe grass begins to fail, I make up the deficiency by extra feed of meal\r\nand corn fodder. I feed all my whey to my cows. I let them run dry four\r\nmonths, and during this time I give them no extra feed, always keeping\r\nsalt before them.”\r\n\r\nAnother, with one of the best butter dairies in the same state, explains\r\nhis mode of management of cows in the stall as follows: “In the\r\nmanagement of my stock the utmost gentleness is observed, and exact\r\nregularity in the hours of feeding while confined to the stable, and of\r\nmilking throughout the year.\r\n\r\n“The stock is fed regularly three times a day.\r\n\r\n“In the morning, as soon as the milking is over, each cow (having been\r\npreviously fed, and her bag cleaned by washing, if necessary) is\r\nthoroughly cleaned and groomed, if the expression may be used, with a\r\ncurry-comb, from head to foot, and, when cleaned, turned out to drink.\r\nThe stable is now cleaned out, the mangers swept, and the floors\r\nsprinkled with plaster; and as the cows return, which they do as soon as\r\ninclined, they are tied up and left undisturbed until the next hour of\r\nfeeding, which is at noon.\r\n\r\n“The cattle at this time are again turned out to drink, and, after being\r\ntied up on their return again, fed. Of course the stable is at this time\r\nagain thoroughly cleansed. And so again at night the same course is\r\npursued. At this time a good bedding is spread for each cow, and, after\r\nall are in, they are fed.\r\n\r\n“At six o’clock the milking commences, and at its termination, after\r\nremoving from the floor whatever manure may have been dropped, the\r\nstable is closed for the night. If carrots are fed, which is the only\r\nroot allowed to my cows in milk, they are given at the time of the\r\nevening milking.\r\n\r\n“Whatever material is taken for bedding (as corn-stalks, husks, &c.) is\r\npassed through a cutting-machine, and composes the noon feed, such\r\nportions as are not consumed by the cows being used for bedding. The\r\nadditional labor of cutting up is amply compensated by the reduced\r\namount of labor in working (loading) and ploughing under the manure.\r\n\r\n“While I consider it highly desirable that the cows, during the period\r\nthey are stabled, should be kept warm and dry, I regard it as\r\nindispensable that they should be perfectly clean; and, although the\r\nstock is stabled the whole time, care is taken that there is a\r\nsufficient degree of ventilation.”\r\n\r\nIn Herkimer county, New York, one of the best dairy districts in the\r\ncountry, a dairy farmer who kept twenty-five cows for the manufacture of\r\ncheese, making in one year nearly seven hundred pounds per cow, states\r\nhis mode of feeding as follows: “When the ground is settled, and grass\r\nis grown so that cows can get their fill without too much toil, they are\r\nallowed to graze an hour, only, the first day; the second day a little\r\nlonger, and so on, till they get accustomed to the change of feed before\r\nthey are allowed to have full range of pasture. Shift of pasture is\r\nfrequently made to keep feed fresh and a good bite. About one acre per\r\ncow affords plenty of feed till the first of August. If enough land was\r\nturned to pasture to feed the cows through the season, it would get a\r\nstart of them about this time, and be hard and dry the balance of the\r\nseason. To avoid turning on my meadows in the fall, I take one acre to\r\nevery ten cows, plough and prepare it the fore part of June for sowing;\r\nI commence sowing _corn_ broadcast, about half an acre at a time (for\r\ntwenty-five cows), so that it may grow eighty or ninety days before it\r\nis cut and fed. I have found, by experiment, that it then contains the\r\nmost saccharine juice, and will produce the most milk. If the ground is\r\nstrong, I sow two bushels per acre; more if the ground is not manured.\r\n\r\n“The common yield is from fifteen to twenty tons (of green feed) per\r\nacre. About the first of August, when heat and flies are too oppressive\r\nfor cows to feed quietly in the day-time, I commence feeding them with\r\nwhat corn they will eat in the morning, daily, which is cut up with a\r\ngrass-scythe, and drawn on a sled or wagon to the milk-barn and fed to\r\nthem in the stalls, which is one hour’s work for a man at each feeding.\r\nWhen thus plentifully fed, my cows have their _knitting_-work on hand\r\nfor the day, which they can do up by lying quietly under artificial\r\nshades, erected in such places as need manuring most, and are most airy,\r\nby setting posts and putting poles and bushes on top, the sides being\r\nleft open. These shades may be made and removed annually, to enrich\r\nother portions of soil, if desired, at the small expense of one dollar\r\nfor each ten cows. At evening, my cows are fed whey only, because they\r\ncan feed more quietly, with less rambling, and will give more milk by\r\nfeeding most when the dew is on the grass.\r\n\r\n“The capacity of cows for giving milk is varied much by habit. In fall,\r\nafter the season of feeding is past, I feed four quarts of wheat bran or\r\nshorts made into slop with whey, or a peck of roots to each cow, till\r\nmilking season closes (about the first of December). When confined in\r\nstables and fed hay and milked, they are fed each one pail full of thin\r\nslop at morning before foddering, and also at evening, to render their\r\nfood more succulent, and they will not drink so much cold water when let\r\nout in the middle of the day. In cold weather cows are kept well\r\nattended in warm stables. No foddering is done on the ground. Thus a\r\nsupply of milk is kept up, and the cows get in good flesh, while their\r\nblood and bags are left in a healthy condition when dried off.\r\n\r\n“This flesh they hold till milk season in spring, without other feed\r\nthan good hay. They will not get fleshy bags, but come into milk at\r\nonce. About the first of April they are carded daily, till they are\r\nturned to grass. Wheat-bran in milk or whey, slops, or roots, are daily\r\nfed, as they are found best adapted to the nature of different cows, and\r\nmost likely to establish a regular flow of milk till grass comes.”\r\n\r\nAll practical dairymen concur in saying that a _warm and well-ventilated\r\nbarn_ is indispensable to the promotion of the highest yield of milk in\r\nwinter; and most agree that cows in milk should not be turned out even\r\nto drink in cold weather, all exposure to cold tending to lessen the\r\nyield of milk.\r\n\r\nIn the London dairies, where, of course, the cows are fed so as to\r\nproduce the largest flow of milk, the treatment is as follows: The cows\r\nare kept at night in stalls. About three A. M. each has half a bushel of\r\ngrains. When milking is finished, each receives a bushel of turnips (or\r\nmangolds), and shortly afterwards one tenth of a truss of hay of the\r\nbest quality. This feeding occurs before eight A. M., when the animals\r\nare turned into the yard. Four hours after, they are again tied up in\r\ntheir stalls, and have another feed of grains. When the afternoon\r\nmilking is over (about three P. M.), they are fed with a bushel of\r\nturnips, and after the lapse of an hour, hay is given them as before.\r\nThis mode of feeding usually continues throughout the root season, or\r\nfrom November to March. During the remaining months they are fed with\r\ngrains, tares, and cabbages, and a proportion of rowen or second-cut\r\nhay. They are supplied regularly until they are turned out to grass,\r\nwhen they pass the whole of the night in the field. The yield is about\r\nsix hundred and fifty gallons a year for each cow.\r\n\r\nMr. Harley, whose admirable dairy establishment has been already alluded\r\nto, as erected for the purpose of supplying the city of Glasgow with a\r\ngood quality of milk, and which contributed more than anything else to\r\nimprove the quality of milk furnished to all the cities of Great\r\nBritain, adopted the following system of feeding with the greatest\r\nprofit: In the early part of summer, young grass and green barley, the\r\nfirst cutting especially, mixed with a large proportion of old hay or\r\nstraw, and a good quantity of salt to prevent swelling, were used. As\r\nsummer advanced less hay and straw were given, and as the grass\r\napproached ripeness they were discontinued altogether, but young and wet\r\nclover was never given without an admixture of dry provender. When grass\r\nbecame scarce, young turnips and turnip-leaves were steamed with hay,\r\nand formed a good substitute. As grass decreased the turnips were\r\nincreased, and at length became a complete substitute. As the season\r\nadvanced a large proportion of distillers’ grains and wash was given\r\nwith other food, but these were found to be apt to make the cattle\r\ngrain-sick; and if this feeding were long continued, the health of the\r\ncows became affected. Boiled linseed and short-cut wheat-straw mixed\r\nwith the grains were found to prevent the cows from turning sick. As\r\nspring approached, Swedish turnips, when cheap, were substituted for\r\nyellow turnips. These two roots, steamed with hay and other mixtures,\r\nafforded soft food till grass was again in season. When any of the cows\r\nwere surfeited, the food was withheld till the appetite returned, when a\r\nsmall quantity was given, and increased gradually to the full allowance.\r\n\r\nBut the most elaborate and valuable experiments in the feeding and\r\nmanagement of milch cows are those recently made by Mr. T. Horsfall, of\r\nEngland, and published in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.\r\nHis practice, though adapted, perhaps, more especially to his own\r\nsection, is nevertheless of such general application and importance as\r\nto be worthy of attention. By his course of treatment he found that he\r\ncould produce as much and as rich butter in winter as in summer.\r\n\r\nHis first object was to afford a full supply of the elements of food\r\nadapted to the _maintenance_ and also to the _produce_ of the animal;\r\nand this could not be effected by the ordinary food and methods of\r\nfeeding, since it is impossible to induce a cow to consume a quantity of\r\nhay requisite to supply the waste of the system, and keep up, at the\r\nsame time, a full yield of the best quality of milk. He used, to some\r\nextent, cabbages, kohl rabi, mangolds, shorts, and other substances,\r\nrich in the constituents of cheese and butter. “My food for milch cows,”\r\nsays he, “after having undergone various modifications, has for two\r\nseasons consisted of rape-cake five pounds and bran two pounds, for each\r\ncow, mixed with a sufficient quantity of bean-straw, oat-straw, and\r\nshells of oats, in equal proportions, to supply them three times a day\r\nwith as much as they will eat. The whole of the materials are moistened\r\nand blended together, and, after being well steamed, are given to the\r\nanimals in a warm state. The attendant is allowed one pound to one and a\r\nhalf pounds per cow, according to circumstances, of bean-meal, which he\r\nis charged to give to each cow in proportion to the yield of milk; those\r\nin full milk getting two pounds each per day, others but little. It is\r\ndry, and mixed with the steamed food on its being dealt out separately.\r\nWhen this is eaten up, green food is given, consisting of cabbages from\r\nOctober to December, kohl rabi till February, and mangold till grass\r\ntime. With a view to nicety of flavor, I limit the supply of green food\r\nto thirty or thirty-five pounds per day for each. After each feed, four\r\npounds of meadow hay, or twelve pounds per day, is given to each cow.\r\nThey are allowed water twice a day to the extent they will drink.”\r\n\r\nBean-straw uncooked being found to be hard and unpalatable, it was\r\nsteamed to make it soft and pulpy, when it possessed an agreeable odor,\r\nand imparted its flavor to the whole mess. It was cut for this purpose\r\njust before ripening, but after the bean was fully grown, and in this\r\nstate was found to possess nearly double the amount of albuminous\r\nmatter, so valuable to milch cows, of good meadow or upland hay. Bean or\r\nshorts is also vastly improved by steaming or soaking with hot water,\r\nwhen its nutriment is more readily assimilated. It contains about\r\nfourteen per cent. of albumen, and is rich in phosphoric acid. Rape-cake\r\nwas found to be exceedingly valuable. Linseed and cotton-seed cake may\r\nprobably be substituted for it in this country. Mr. Horsfall is\r\naccustomed to turn his cows in May into a rich pasture, housing them at\r\nnight, and giving them a mess of the steamed mixture and some hay\r\nmorning and night; and from June to October they have cut grass in the\r\nstall, besides what they get in the pasture, and two feeds of the\r\nsteamed mixture a day. After the beginning of October the cows are kept\r\nhoused. With such management, his cows generally yield from twelve to\r\nsixteen quarts of milk (wine measure) a day, for about eight months\r\nafter calving, when they fall off in milk, but gain in flesh, up to\r\ncalving-time. In this course of treatment the manure is far better than\r\nthe average, and his pastures are constantly improved. The average\r\namount of butter from every sixteen quarts of milk is twenty-five\r\nounces, a proportion far larger than the average. His investigations are\r\nvery full and complete.--See Appendix.\r\n\r\nHow widely does this course of practice differ from that of most\r\nfarmers! The object with many seems to be to see with how little food\r\nthey can keep the cow alive. Now, it appears to me that the milch cow\r\nshould be regarded as an instrument of transformation. With so much hay,\r\nso much grain, so many roots, how can the most milk, or butter, or\r\ncheese, be made? The conduct of a manufacturer who owned good machinery,\r\nand an abundance of raw material, and had the labor at hand, would be\r\nconsidered as very absurd, if he hesitated to supply the material, and\r\nkeep the machinery at work at least so long as he could run it with\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nStimulate the appetite, then, and induce the cow to eat, by a frequent\r\nchange of diet, not merely enough to supply the constant waste of her\r\nsystem, but enough and to spare, of a food adapted to the production of\r\nmilk of the quality desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILING.--Of the advantages of soiling milch cows, or feeding\r\nexclusively in the barn, there are still many conflicting opinions. As\r\nto its economy of land and food there is no question, it being generally\r\nadmitted that a given number of animals may be abundantly fed on a less\r\nspace; nor is there much question as to the increased quantity of milk\r\nyielded in stall feeding. Its economy in this country turns rather upon\r\nthe cost of labor and land; and the question asked by the dairyman is\r\nwhether it will pay--whether its advantages are sufficient to balance\r\nthe extra expense of cutting and feeding over and above cropping on the\r\npasture. The importance of this subject has been strongly impressed upon\r\nthe attention of farmers in many sections of the country, by a growing\r\nconviction that something must be done to improve the pastures, or that\r\nthey must be abandoned altogether.\r\n\r\nThousands of acres of neglected pasture-land in the older states are so\r\npoor and worn out that from four to eight acres furnish but a miserable\r\nsubsistence for a good-sized cow. No animal can flourish under such\r\ncircumstances. The labor and exertion of feeding is too great, to say\r\nnothing of the vastly inferior quality of the grasses in such pastures\r\nto those on more recently seeded lands. True economy would dictate that\r\nsuch pastures should either be allowed to run up to wood, or be devoted\r\nto sheep-walks, or ploughed and improved. Cows, to be able to yield\r\nwell, must have plenty of food of a sweet and nutritious quality; and\r\nunless they find it, they wander over a large space, if at liberty, and\r\ndeprive themselves of rest.\r\n\r\nIf a farmer or dairyman is the unfortunate owner of such pastures, there\r\ncan be no question that, as a matter of real economy, he had better\r\nresort to the soiling system for his milch cows, by which means he will\r\nlargely increase his annual supply of good manure, and thus have the\r\nmeans of improving, and bringing his land to a higher state of\r\ncultivation. A very successful instance of this management occurs in the\r\nreport of the visiting committee of an agricultural society in\r\nMassachusetts, in which they say: “We have now in mind a farmer in this\r\ncounty who keeps seven or eight cows in the stable through the summer,\r\nand feeds them on green fodder, chiefly Indian-corn. We asked him the\r\nreasons for it. His answer was: 1. That he gets more milk than he can by\r\nany other method. 2. That he gets more manure, especially liquid manure.\r\n3. That he saves it all, by keeping a supply of mould or mud under the\r\nstable, to be taken out and renewed as often as necessary. 4. That it is\r\nless troublesome than to drive his cows to pasture; that they are less\r\nvexed by flies, and have equally good health. 5. That his mowing-land is\r\nevery year growing more productive, without the expense of artificial\r\nmanure. He estimates that on an acre of good land twenty tons of green\r\nfodder may be raised. That which is dried is cut fine, and mixed with\r\nmeal or shorts, and fed with profit. He believes that a reduced and\r\npartially worn-out farm--supposing the land to be naturally good--could\r\nbe brought into prime order in five years, without extra outlay of money\r\nfor manure, by the use of green fodder in connection with the raising\r\nand keeping of pigs; not fattening them, but selling at the age of four\r\nor five months.” He keeps most of his land in grass, improving its\r\nquality and productiveness by means of top-dressing, and putting money\r\nin his pocket,--which is, after all, the true test both for theory and\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nAnother practical case in hand on this point is that of a gentleman in\r\nthe same state, who had four cows, but not a rod of land to pasture them\r\non. They were, therefore, never out of the barn,--or, at least, not out\r\nof the yard,--and were fed with grass, regularly mown for them; with\r\ngreen Indian-corn fodder, which had been sown broadcast for the purpose;\r\nand with about three pints of meal a day. Their produce in butter was\r\nkept for thirteen weeks. Two of them were but two years old, having\r\ncalved the same spring. All the milk of one of them was taken by her\r\ncalf six weeks out of the thirteen, and some of the milk of the other\r\nwas taken for family use, the quantity of which was not measured. These\r\nheifers could not be estimated, therefore, as more than equal to one cow\r\nin full milk. And yet from these cows no less than three hundred and\r\neighty-nine pounds of butter were made in the thirteen weeks. Another\r\npound would have made an average of thirty pounds a week for the whole\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these, and other similar instances of successful\r\nsoiling, or stall-feeding in summer on green crops cut for the purpose,\r\nthat the largely increased quantity of the yield fully counterbalances\r\nthe slightly deteriorated quality. And not only is the quantity yielded\r\nby each cow increased, but the same extent of land, under good culture,\r\nwill carry double or treble the number of ordinary pastures, and keep\r\nthem in better condition. There is also a saving of manure. But with us\r\nthe economy of soiling is the exception, and not the rule.\r\n\r\nIn adopting this system of feeding, regularity is required as much as in\r\nany other, and a proper variety of food. A succession of green crops\r\nshould be provided, as near as convenient to the stable. The first will\r\nnaturally be winter rye, in the Northern States, as that shoots up with\r\ngreat luxuriance. Winter rape would probably be an exceedingly valuable\r\naddition to the plants usually cultivated for soiling in this country,\r\nin sections where it withstands the severity of the winter. Cabbages\r\nkept in the cellar, or pit, and transplanted early, will also come in\r\nhere to advantage, and clover will very soon follow them; oats, millet,\r\nand green Indian-corn, as the season advances; and, a little later\r\nstill, perhaps, the Chinese sugar-cane, which should not be cut till\r\nheaded out. These plants, in addition to other cultivated grasses, will\r\nfurnish an unfailing succession of succulent and tender fodder; while\r\nthe addition of a little Indian, linseed, or cotton-seed meal will be\r\nfound economical.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of large towns and cities, where the object is too often\r\nto feed for the largest quantity, without reference to quality, an\r\narticle known as distillers’ swill, or still-slop, is extensively used.\r\nThis, if properly fed in limited quantities, in combination with other\r\nand more bulky food, may be a valuable article for the dairyman; but, if\r\ngiven, as it too often is, without the addition of other kinds of food,\r\nit soon affects the health and constitution of the animals fed on it.\r\nThis swill contains a considerable quantity of water, some nitrogenous\r\ncompounds, and some inorganic matter, in the shape of phosphates and\r\nalkaline salts found in the different kinds of grain of which it is made\r\nup, as Indian corn, wheat, barley, rye, &c. Where this forms the\r\nprincipal food of milch cows, the milk is of a very poor quality--blue\r\nin color, and requiring the addition of coloring substances to make it\r\nsalable. It contains, often, less than one per cent. of butter, and\r\nseldom over one and three tenths or one and a half per cent., while\r\ngood, salable milk ought to contain from three to five per cent. It will\r\nnot coagulate, it is said, in less than five or six hours, while good\r\nmilk will invariably coagulate in one hour or less, under the same\r\nconditions. Its effect on the system of young children is therefore very\r\ndestructive, causing diseases of various kinds, and, if continued,\r\ncertain death.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKING.--The manner of milking exerts a more powerful and lasting\r\ninfluence on the productiveness of the cow than most farmers are aware\r\nof. That a slow and careless milker soon dries up the best of cows,\r\nevery practical farmer and dairyman knows; but a careful examination of\r\nthe beautiful structure of the udder will serve further to explain the\r\nproper mode of milking, to obtain and keep up the largest yield. “The\r\nudder of a cow,” says a writer in the Rural Cyclopædia, “is a unique\r\nmass, composed of _two_ symmetrical parts, simply united to each other\r\nby a cellular tissue, lax, and very abundant; and each of these parts\r\ncomprises two divisions or quarters, which consist of many small\r\ngranules, and are connected together by a compact laminous tissue; and\r\nfrom each quarter proceed systems of ducts, which form successive unions\r\nand confluences, somewhat in the manner of the many affluents of a large\r\nriver, until they terminate in one grand excretory canal, which passes\r\ndown through the elongated mammillary body called the teat. Its\r\nlactiferous or milk tubes, however, do not, as might be supposed,\r\nproceed exactly from smaller to larger ducts by a gradual and regular\r\nenlargement, because it would not have been proper that the secretion of\r\nmilk should escape as it was formed; and therefore we find an apparatus\r\nadapted for the purpose of retaining it for a proper time. This\r\napparatus is to be found both in the teat and in the internal\r\nconstruction of the udder. The teat resembles a funnel in shape, and\r\nsomewhat in office; and it is possessed of a considerable degree of\r\nelasticity. It seems formed principally of the cutis, with some muscular\r\nfibres, and it is covered on the outside by cuticle, like every other\r\npart of the body; but the cuticle here not only covers the exterior, but\r\nalso turns upwards, and lines the inside of the extremity of the teat,\r\nas far as it is contracted, and there terminates by a frilled edge, the\r\nrest of the interior of the teats and ducts being lined by mucous\r\nmembrane. But, as the udder in most animals is attached in a pendulous\r\nmanner to the body, and as the weight of the column of fluid would press\r\nwith a force which would, in every case, overcome the resistance of the\r\ncontractions of the extremity, or prove oppressive to the teat, there is\r\nin the internal arrangement of the udder a provision made to obviate\r\nthis difficulty. The various ducts, as they are united, do not become\r\ngradually enlarged so as to admit the ready flow of milk in a continual\r\nstream to the teat, but are so arranged as to take off, in a great\r\nmeasure, the extreme pressure to which the teat would be otherwise\r\nexposed. Each main duct, as it enters into another, has a contraction\r\nproduced, by which a kind of valvular apparatus is formed in such a\r\nmanner as to become pouches or sacks, capable of containing the great\r\nbody of the milk. In consequence of this arrangement, it is necessary\r\nthat a kind of movement upwards, or lift, should be given to the udder\r\nbefore the teat is drawn, to force out the milk; and by this lift the\r\nmilk is displaced from these pouches, and escapes into the teat, and is\r\nthen easily squeezed out; while the contractions, or pouches, at the\r\nsame time resist, in a certain degree, the return or reflux of the\r\ndisplaced milk.”\r\n\r\nThe first requisite of a good milker is, of course, the utmost\r\ncleanliness. Without this, the milk is unendurable. The udder should,\r\ntherefore, be carefully cleaned before the milking commences. The milker\r\nmay begin gradually and gently, but should steadily increase the\r\nrapidity of the operation till the udder is emptied, using a pail\r\nsufficiently large to hold all, without the necessity of changing. Cows\r\nare very sensitive, and the pail cannot be changed, nor can the milker\r\nstop or rise during the process of milking, without leading the cow more\r\nor less to withhold her milk. The utmost care should be taken to strip\r\nto the last drop, and to do it rapidly, and not in a slow and negligent\r\nmanner, which is sure to have its effect on the yield of the cow. If any\r\nmilk is left, it is reabsorbed into the system, or else becomes caked,\r\nand diminishes the tendency to secrete a full quantity afterwards.\r\nMilking as dry as possible is especially necessary with young cows with\r\ntheir first calf, as the mode of milking, and the length of time to\r\nwhich they can be made to hold out, will have very much to do with their\r\nmilking qualities as long as they live.\r\n\r\nAt the age of two or three years the milky glands have not become fully\r\ndeveloped, and their largest development will depend very greatly upon\r\nthe management after the first calf. Cows should have, therefore, the\r\nmost milk-producing food; be treated with constant gentleness; never\r\nstruck, or spoken harshly to, but coaxed and caressed; and in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred they will grow up gentle and quiet.\r\nBut harshness is worse than useless. Nothing does so much to dry a cow\r\nup, especially a young cow.\r\n\r\nThe longer the young cow, with her first, and second calf, can be made\r\nto hold out, the more surely will this habit be fixed upon her. Stop\r\nmilking her four months before the next calf, and it will be difficult\r\nto make her hold out to within four or six weeks of the time of calving\r\nafterwards. Induce her, if possible, by moist and succulent food, and by\r\ncareful milking, to hold out even up to the time of calving, if you\r\ndesire to milk her so long, and this habit will be likely to be fixed\r\nupon her for life. But do not expect to obtain the full yield of a cow\r\nthe first year after calving. Some of the very best cows are slow to\r\ndevelop their best qualities; and no cow reaches her prime till the age\r\nof five or six years.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance of care and attention to these points cannot be\r\nover-estimated. The wild cows grazing on the plains of South America are\r\nsaid to give only about three or four quarts a day at the height of the\r\nflow; and many an owner of large herds in Texas, it is said, has too\r\nlittle milk for family use, and sometimes receives his supply of butter\r\nfrom the New York market. There is, therefore, a constant tendency to\r\ndry up in milch cows; and it must be guarded against with special care,\r\ntill the habit of yielding a large quantity, and yielding it long,\r\nbecomes fixed in the young animal, when, with proper care, it may easily\r\nbe kept up.\r\n\r\nIf gentle and mild treatment is observed and persevered in, the\r\noperation of milking appears to be one of pleasure to the animal, as it\r\nundoubtedly is; but if an opposite course is pursued,--if, at every\r\nrestless movement, caused, perhaps, by pressing a sore teat, the animal\r\nis harshly spoken to,--she will be likely to learn to kick as a habit,\r\nand it will be difficult to overcome it ever afterwards. To induce quiet\r\nand readiness to give down the milk freely, it is better that the cow\r\nshould be fed at milking-time with cut feed, or roots, placed within her\r\neasy reach.\r\n\r\nI have never practised milking more than twice a day, because in spring\r\nand summer other farm-work was too pressing to allow of it; but there is\r\nno doubt that, for some weeks after calving, and in the height, of the\r\nflow, the cows ought, if possible, to be milked regularly three times a\r\nday--at early morning, noon, and night. Every practical dairyman knows\r\nthat cows thus milked give a larger quantity of milk than if milked only\r\ntwice, though it may not be quite so rich; and in young cows, no doubt,\r\nit has a tendency to promote the development of the udder and\r\nmilk-veins. A frequent milking stimulates an increased secretion,\r\ntherefore, and ought never to be neglected in the milk-dairy, either in\r\nthe case of young cows or very large milkers, at the height of the flow,\r\nwhich will ordinarily be for two or three months after calving.\r\n\r\nThe charge of this branch of the dairy should generally be intrusted to\r\nwomen. They are more gentle and winning than men. The same person should\r\nmilk the same cow regularly, and not change from one to another, unless\r\nthere are special reasons for it.\r\n\r\nThere being a wide difference in the quality as well as in the quantity\r\nof milk of different cows, no dairyman should neglect to test the milk\r\nof each new addition to his dairy stock, whether it be an animal of his\r\nown raising or one brought from abroad. A lactometer is a very\r\nconvenient instrument here; but any one can set the milk of each cow\r\nseparately at first, and give it a fair and full trial, when the\r\ndifference will be found to be great. Economy will dictate that the cows\r\nleast adapted to the purpose should be disposed of, and their place\r\nsupplied by better ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARN.--The management of dairy stock requires a warm and\r\nwell-ventilated barn or cow-room, in latitudes where it becomes\r\nnecessary to stall-feed during several months of the year. This should\r\nbe arranged in a manner suitable to keeping hay and other fodder dry and\r\nsweet, and with reference to the comfort and health of animals, and the\r\neconomy of labor and manure. The size and finish will, of course, depend\r\non the wants and means of the farmer or dairyman; but many little\r\nconveniences can be added at trifling cost.\r\n\r\nThe cow-room, Fig. 56a, is given as an illustration merely of a\r\nconvenient arrangement for a medium-sized dairy, and not as adapted to\r\nall circumstances or situations. The barn stands, we will suppose, upon\r\na side hill, or an inclined surface, where it is easy to have a cellar,\r\nif it is desired; and the cow-room, as shown in the figure, is in the\r\nsecond story, or directly over the cellar, the bottom of which should be\r\nsomewhat dished, or lower in the middle than around the outer sides, and\r\ncarefully paved or laid in cement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56a. Cow-room for 34 cows and 3 yoke of oxen.]\r\n\r\nThe cow-room, as shown in the figure, is drawn on a scale of twenty feet\r\nto the inch. On the outside is represented an open shed, _m_, for carts\r\nand wagons to remain under cover, thirty feet by fifteen, while _l l l l\r\nl l_ are bins for vegetables, to be filled through scuttles from the\r\nfloor of the story above, and surrounded by solid walls. The area of\r\nthis whole floor equals one hundred feet by fifty-seven. _k_, open\r\nspace, and nearly on a level with the cow-chamber, through the door _p_.\r\n_s_, stairs to third story and to the cellar. _d d d_, passage next to\r\nthe walls, five feet wide, and nine inches above the dung-pit. _e e e_,\r\ndung-pit, two feet wide, and seven inches below the floor where the\r\ncattle stand. The manure drops from this pit into the cellar below, five\r\nfeet from the walls, and quite round the cellar. _c c c_, plank floor\r\nfor cows, four feet six inches long. _b b b_, stalls for three yoke of\r\noxen, on a platform five feet six inches long. _n n_, calf-pens, which\r\nmay be used also for cows in calving. _r r_, feeding-troughs for calves.\r\nThe feeding-boxes are made in the form of trays, with partitions between\r\nthem. Water comes in by a pipe, to cistern _a_. This cistern is\r\nregulated by a cock and ball, and the water flows by dotted lines, _o o\r\no_, to the boxes, and each box is connected by lead pipes well secured\r\nfrom frost, so that, if desired, each animal can be watered without\r\nleaving the stall, or water can be kept constantly before it. A scuttle\r\nby which sweepings, etc., may be put through into the cellar, is seen\r\nat _f_. _g_ is a bin receiving cut hay from third story, or hay-room. _h\r\nh h h h h_, bins for grain-feed. _i_ is a tunnel to conduct manure or\r\nmuck from the hay-floor to the cellar. _j j_, sliding doors on wheels.\r\nThe cows all face towards the open area in the centre.\r\n\r\nThis cow-room may be furnished with a thermometer, clock, etc., and\r\nshould always be well ventilated by sliding windows, which at the same\r\ntime admit the light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57a.]\r\n\r\nFig. 57a is a transverse section of the cow-room, Fig. 56a, _a_ being a\r\nwalk behind the cows, five feet wide; _b_, dung-pit; _c_, cattle-stand;\r\n_d_, feeding-trough, with a bottom on a level with the platform where\r\nthe cattle stand; _k_, open area, forty-three feet by fifty-six.\r\n\r\nThe story above the cow-room, Fig. 58a, is one hundred feet by\r\nforty-two, the bays for hay, ten on each side, being ten feet front and\r\nfifteen feet deep, and the open space, _p_, for the entrance of wagons,\r\ncarts, etc., twelve feet wide. _b_, hay-scales. _c_, scale-beam. _m m m\r\nm m m_, ladders reaching almost to the roof. _l l l_, &c., scuttle-holes\r\nfor sending vegetables direct to the bins, _l l l_, etc., below. _a a b\r\nb_, rooms on the corners for storage. _d_, scuttles, four of which are\r\nused for straw, one for cut hay, and one for muck for the cellar. _n_\r\nand the other small squares are eighteen-feet posts. _f_, passage to the\r\ntool-house, a room one hundred feet long by fifteen wide. _o_, stairs\r\nleading to the scaffold in the roof of the tool-house. _i i_, benches.\r\n_g_, floor. _h_, boxes for hoes, shovels, spades, picks, iron bars, old\r\niron, etc. _j j j_, bins for fruit. _k_, scuttles to put apples into\r\nwagons, etc., in the shed below. One side of this tool-house may be used\r\nfor ploughs and large implements, hay-rigging, harrows, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58a. Room over the cow-room for hay, &c.]\r\n\r\nProper ventilation of the cellar and the cow-room avoids the objection\r\nthat the hay is liable to injury from noxious gases.\r\n\r\nThe excellent manure-cellar beneath this barn extends only under the\r\ncow-room. It has a drive-way through doors on each side. No barn-cellar\r\nshould be kept shut up tight, even in cold weather. The gases are\r\nconstantly escaping from the manure, unless held by absorbents, and are\r\nliable not only to affect the health of the stock, but to injure the\r\nquality of the hay. To prevent this, and yet secure the important\r\nadvantages of a manure-cellar, the barn may be furnished with good-sized\r\nventilators on the top, for every twenty-five feet of its length, and\r\nwith wooden tubes leading from the cellar to the top.\r\n\r\nThere should also be windows on different sides of the cellar, to admit\r\na free circulation of air. With these precautions, together with the use\r\nof absorbents in the shape of loam and muck, there will be no danger of\r\nrotting the timbers of the barn, or of risking the health of the cattle\r\nor the quality of the hay.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which the cow-room should be kept is somewhere from\r\n50° to 60°, Fahr. The practice and the opinions of successful dairymen\r\ndiffer on this point. Too great heat would affect the health and\r\nappetite of the herd, while too low a temperature is equally\r\nobjectionable, for various reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE RAISING OF CALVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been found in practice that calves properly bred and raised on\r\nthe farm have a far greater intrinsic value for that farm, other things\r\nbeing equal, than any that can be procured elsewhere, while on the\r\nmanner in which they are raised will depend much of their future\r\nusefulness and profit. These considerations should have their proper\r\nweight in the decision as to whether a promising calf from a good cow\r\nand bull shall be kept or sold to the butcher. But, rather than raise a\r\ncalf at hap-hazard, and simply because its dam was celebrated as a\r\nmilker, the judicious farmer will judge of the peculiar characteristics\r\nof the animal itself. This will often save a great and useless outlay\r\nwhich has sometimes been incurred in raising calves for dairy purposes,\r\nthat a more careful examination would have rejected as unpromising.\r\n\r\nThe method of judging stock developed in a former chapter is of\r\npractical use here, and it is safer to rely upon it, to some extent,\r\nparticularly when other appearances concur, than to go on blindly. The\r\nmilk-mirror on the calf is small, but no smaller in proportion to its\r\nsize than that of the cow; while its shape and form can generally be\r\ndistinctly seen, particularly at the end of ten or twelve weeks. The\r\ndevelopment of the udder, and other peculiarities, will give some\r\nindication of the future capacities of the animal, and these should be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nIf we except the manure of young stock, the calf is the first product of\r\nthe cow, and as such demands our attention, whether it is to be raised\r\nor hurried off to the shambles. The practice adopted in raising calves\r\ndiffers widely in different sections of the country, being governed very\r\nmuch by local circumstances, as the vicinity of a milk-market, the value\r\nof milk for the dairy, the object of breeding, whether mainly for beef,\r\nfor work, or for the dairy, etc.; but, in general, it may be said that\r\nwithin the range of thirty or forty miles of good veal-markets, which\r\nlarge towns furnish, comparatively few are raised at all. Most of them\r\nare fatted and sold at ages varying from three to eight or ten weeks;\r\nand in milk-dairies still nearer large towns and cities they are often\r\nhurried off at one or two days, or, at most, a week old. In both of\r\nthese cases, as long as the calf is kept it is generally allowed to\r\nsuckle the cow, and, as the treatment is very simple, there is nothing\r\nwhich particularly calls for remark, unless it be to condemn the\r\npractice entirely, on the ground that there is a more profitable way\r\neven for fattening calves for the butcher, and to say that allowing the\r\ncalf to suck the cow at all is objectionable on the score of economy,\r\nexcept in cases where it is rendered necessary by the hard and swollen\r\ncondition of the udder.\r\n\r\nIf the calf is so soon to be taken away, I should prefer not to suffer\r\nthe cow to become attached to it at all, since she is apt to withhold\r\nher milk when it is removed, and a loss is sustained. The farmer will be\r\ngoverned by the question of profit, whatever course it is proposed to\r\nadopt. In raising blood stock, however, or in raising beef cattle,\r\nwithout any regard to economy of milk, the system of suckling the\r\ncalves, or letting them run with the cow, may and will be adopted,\r\nsince it is usually attended with somewhat less labor.\r\n\r\nThe other course, which is regarded as the best where the calf is to be\r\nraised for the dairy, is to bring it up by hand. This is done almost\r\nuniversally in all countries where the raising of dairy cows is best\r\nunderstood,--in Switzerland, Holland, some parts of Germany, and\r\nEngland. It requires rather more care, on the whole; but it is decidedly\r\npreferable, since the calves cost less, as the food can be easily\r\nmodified, and the growth is not checked, as it is apt to be when the\r\ncalf is finally taken off from the cow. I speak, of course, of sections\r\nwhere the milk of the cow is of some account for the dairy, and where it\r\nis too valuable to be devoted entirely to nourishing the calf. In this\r\ncase, as soon as the calf is dropped the cow is allowed to lick off the\r\nslimy moisture till it is dry, which she will usually do from instinct,\r\nor, if not, a slight sprinkling of salt over the body of the calf will\r\nimmediately tempt her. The calf is left to suck once or twice, which it\r\nwill do as soon as it is able to stand. It should, in all cases, be\r\npermitted to have the first milk that comes from the cow, which is of a\r\nturbid, yellowish color, unfit for any of the purposes of the dairy, but\r\nsomewhat purgative or medicinal, and admirably and wisely designed by\r\nnature to free the bowels and intestines of the new-born animal from the\r\nmucous, excrementitious matter always existing in them after birth. Too\r\nmuch of this new milk may, however, be hurtful even to the new-born\r\ncalf, while it should never be given at all to older calves. The best\r\ncourse, it seems to me,--and I speak from considerable experience, and\r\nmuch observation and inquiry of others,--is to milk the cow dry\r\nimmediately after the calf has sucked once, especially if the udder is\r\npainfully distended, which is often the case, and to leave the calf with\r\nthe cow during one day, and after that to feed it by putting the\r\nfingers into its mouth, and gently bringing its muzzle down to the milk\r\nin a pail or trough, when it will imbibe in sucking the fingers. I have\r\nnever found much difficulty in teaching the calf to drink when taken so\r\nyoung, though some take to it much more readily than others. What the\r\ncalf does not need should be given to the cow. Some, however, prefer to\r\nmilk immediately after calving; and if the udder is overloaded this may\r\nbe the best course, though the better practice seems to be to leave the\r\ncow as quietly to herself as possible for a few hours. The less she is\r\ndisturbed, as a general thing, the better. The after-birth should be\r\ntaken from her immediately after it is dropped. It is customary to give\r\nthe cow, as soon as convenient, after calving, some warm and stimulating\r\ndrink,--a little meal stirred into warm water, with a part of the first\r\nmilk that comes from her, seasoned with a little salt.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the calf is taken from the cow immediately, and before she\r\nhas seen it, to a warm, dry pen out of her sight, and there rubbed till\r\nthoroughly dry; and then, when able to stand, fed with the new milk from\r\nthe cow, which it should have three or four times a day, regularly, for\r\nthe first fortnight, whatever course it is proposed to adopt afterwards.\r\nIt is of the greatest importance to give the young calf a thrifty start.\r\nThe milk, unless coming directly from the cow, should be warmed.\r\n\r\nSome object to removing the calf from the cow in this way, on the ground\r\nof its apparent cruelty. But the objection to letting the calf suckle\r\nthe cow for several days, as they do, or indeed of leaving it with the\r\ncow for any length of time, is, that she invariably becomes attached to\r\nit, and frets and withholds her milk when it is at last taken from her.\r\nShe probably suffers a great deal more, after this attachment is once\r\nformed, at the removal of the object of it, than she does at its being\r\ntaken at once out of her sight. The cow’s memory is far greater than\r\nmany suppose; and the loss and injury sustained by removing the calf\r\nafter it has been allowed to suck her for a longer or shorter period is\r\nnever known exactly, because it is not usually known how much milk the\r\ncalf takes; but it is, without doubt, very considerable. If the udder is\r\nall right, there seems to be no good reason for leaving the calf with\r\nthe cow two or three days, if it is then to be taken away.\r\n\r\nThe practice in Holland is to remove the calf from the mother even\r\nbefore it has been licked, and to take it into one corner of the barn,\r\nor into another building, out of the cow’s sight and hearing, put it\r\nupon soft dry straw, and rub it dry with some hay or straw, when its\r\ntongue and gums are slightly rubbed with salt, and the mucus and saliva\r\nremoved from the nostrils and lips. After this has been done, the calf\r\nis made to drink the milk first taken as it comes from the mother. It is\r\nslightly diluted with water, if taken last from the udder; but, if the\r\nfirst of the milking, it is given just as it is. The calf is taught to\r\ndrink in the same manner as in this country, by putting the fingers in\r\nits mouth and bringing it down to the milk, and it soon gets so as to\r\ndrink alone. It is fed at first from four to six times a day, or even\r\noftener; but soon only three times, at regular intervals. Its food for\r\ntwo or three weeks is clear milk, as it comes warm and fresh from the\r\ncow. This is never omitted, as the milk during the most of that time\r\npossesses certain qualities which are necessary to the calf, and which\r\ncannot be effectually supplied by any other food. In the third or fourth\r\nweek the milk is skimmed, but warmed to the degree of fresh milk;\r\nthough, as the calf grows a little older, the milk is given cold, while\r\nless care is taken to give it the milk of its own mother, that of other\r\ncows now answering equally well. In some places calves are fed on\r\nbutter-milk at the age of two weeks and after; but the change from new\r\nmilk, fresh from the cow, is made gradually, some sweet skim-milk and\r\nwarm water being at first added to it.\r\n\r\nAt three weeks old, or thereabouts, the calf will begin to eat a little\r\nsweet, fine hay, and potatoes cut fine, and it very soon becomes\r\naccustomed to this food. Many now begin to give linseed-meal mixed into\r\nhot water, to which is added some skim-milk or butter-milk; and others\r\nuse a little bran cooked in hay-tea, made by chopping the hay fine, and\r\npouring on boiling hot water, which is allowed to stand a while on it.\r\nAn egg is frequently broken into such a mixture. Others still at this\r\nage take pains to have fresh linseed-cake, broken into pieces of the\r\nsize of a pigeon’s-egg; putting one of these into the mouth after the\r\nmeal of milk has been finished, and when it is eager to suck at anything\r\nin its way. It will very soon learn to eat linseed-meal. A little sweet\r\nclover is put in its way at about the age of three weeks, and it will\r\nsoon eat that also.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the feeding is continued from the fourth to the seventh\r\nweek, the quantity of solid food being gradually increased. In the sixth\r\nor seventh week the milk is by degrees withheld, and water or\r\nbutter-milk used instead; and soon after this, green food may be safely\r\ngiven, increasing it gradually with the hay to the age of ten or twelve\r\nweeks, when it will do to put them upon grass alone, if the season is\r\nfavorable for it. A lot as near the house as possible, where they can be\r\neasily looked after and frequently visited, is best. Calves should be\r\ngradually accustomed to all changes; and even after being turned to\r\npasture they ought to be taken in if the weather is not dry and warm.\r\nThe want of care and attention to these little details will be apparent\r\nsooner or later; while, if the farmer give his own time to these\r\nmatters, he will be fully paid in the rapid growth of his calves. It is\r\nespecially necessary to see that the troughs from which they are fed, if\r\ntroughs are used, are kept clean and sweet.\r\n\r\nBut there are some even among intelligent farmers who make a practice of\r\nturning their calves out to pasture at the tender age of two and three\r\nweeks, and that, too, when they have sucked the cow up to that time, and\r\nallow them nothing in the shape of milk or tender care. I cannot but\r\nthink that this is the poorest possible economy, to say nothing of the\r\ncruelty of such treatment. The growth of the calf is checked, and the\r\nsystem receives a shock from so sudden a change, from which it cannot\r\nsoon recover. The careful Dutch breeders bring the calves either skimmed\r\nmilk or butter-milk to drink several times a day after they are turned\r\nto grass, which is not till the age of ten or twelve weeks; and, if the\r\nweather is chilly, the milk is warmed for them. They put a trough\r\ngenerally under a covering, where the calves may come and drink at\r\nregular times. Thus they are kept tame and docile.\r\n\r\nIn the raising of calves, through all stages of their growth, great care\r\nshould be taken neither to starve nor to over-feed. A calf should never\r\nbe surfeited, and never be fed so highly that it cannot be fed more\r\nhighly as it advances. The most important point is to keep it growing\r\nthriftily without getting too fat, if it is to be raised for the dairy.\r\n\r\nMr. Aiton, in describing the mode of rearing calves in the dairy\r\ndistricts of Scotland, says: “They are fed on milk, with seldom any\r\nadmixture; and they are not permitted to suckle their dams, but are\r\ntaught to drink milk by the hand from a dish. They are generally fed on\r\nmilk only for the first four, five, or six weeks, and are then allowed\r\nfrom two to two and a half quarts of new milk each meal, twice in the\r\ntwenty-four hours. Some never give them any other food when young except\r\nmilk, lessening the quantity when the calf begins to eat grass or other\r\nfood, which it generally does when about five weeks old, if grass can be\r\nhad; and withdrawing it entirely about the seventh or eighth week of the\r\ncalf’s age. But, if the calf is reared in winter, or early in spring,\r\nbefore the grass rises, it must be supplied with at least some milk till\r\nit is eight or nine weeks old; as a calf will not so soon learn to eat\r\nhay or straw, nor fare so well on them alone as it will do on pasture.\r\nSome feed their calves reared for stock partly with meal mixed in the\r\nmilk after the third or fourth week. Others introduce gradually some new\r\nwhey among the milk, first mixed with meal; and, when the calf gets\r\nolder, they withdraw the milk, and feed it on whey and porridge.\r\nHay-tea, juices of peas and beans, or pea or bean straw, linseed beaten\r\ninto powder, treacle, &c., have all been sometimes used to advantage in\r\nfeeding calves; but milk, when it can be spared, is by far their most\r\nnatural food.\r\n\r\n“In Galloway, and other pastoral districts, where the calves are allowed\r\nto suckle, the people are so much wedded to their own customs as to\r\nargue that suckling is much more nutritive to the calves than any other\r\nmode of feeding. That suckling induces a greater secretion of saliva,\r\nwhich, by promoting digestion, accelerates the growth and fattening of\r\nthe young animal, cannot be doubted; but the secretion of that fluid may\r\nlikewise be promoted by placing an artificial teat in the mouth of the\r\ncalf; and giving it the milk slowly, and at the natural temperature. In\r\nthe dairy districts of Scotland, the dairy-maid puts one of her fingers\r\ninto the mouth of the calf, when it is fed, which serves the purpose of\r\na teat, and will have nearly the same effect as the natural teat, in\r\ninducing the secretion of saliva. If that, or an artificial teat of\r\nleather, be used, and the milk given slowly before it is cold, the\r\nsecretion of saliva may be promoted to all the extent that can be\r\nnecessary; besides, that secretion is not confined to the mere period of\r\neating, but, as in the human body, the saliva is formed and part of it\r\nswallowed at all times. As part of the saliva is sometimes seen dropping\r\nfrom the mouths of the calves, it might be advisable to give them not\r\nonly an artificial teat, when fed, but to place, as is frequently done,\r\na lump of chalk before them to lick, thus leading them to swallow the\r\nsaliva. The chalk would so far supply the want of salt, of which cattle\r\nare so improperly deprived, and it would also promote the formation of\r\nsaliva. Indeed, calves are much disposed to lick and suckle everything\r\nthat comes within their reach, which seems to be the way that nature\r\nteaches them to supply their stomachs with saliva.\r\n\r\n“But, though suckling their dams may be most advantageous in that\r\nrespect, yet it has also some disadvantages. The cow is always more\r\ninjured than the calf is benefited, by that mode of feeding. She becomes\r\nso fond of the calf that she does not, for a long time after, yield her\r\nmilk freely to the dairy-maid. The calf does not when young draw off the\r\nmilk completely, and when it is taken off by the hand the cow withholds\r\npart of her milk; and, whenever a cow’s udder is not completely emptied\r\nevery time she is milked, the lactic secretion is thereby diminished.\r\n\r\n“Feeding of calves by the hand is in various other respects\r\nadvantageous. Instead of depending on the uncertain or perhaps\r\nprecarious supply of the dam, which may be more at first than the young\r\nanimal can consume or digest, and at other times too little for its\r\nsupply, its food can, by hand-feeding, be regulated to suit the age,\r\nappetite, and purposes for which the calf is intended; other admixtures\r\nor substitutes can be introduced into the milk, and the quantity\r\ngradually increased or withdrawn at pleasure. This is highly necessary\r\nwhen the calves are reared for stock. The milk is in that case\r\ndiminished, and other food introduced so gradually that the stomach of\r\nthe young animal is not injured as it is when the food is too suddenly\r\nchanged. And, in the case of feeding of calves for the butcher, the\r\nquantity of milk is not limited to that of the dam (for no cow will\r\nallow a stranger calf to suckle her), but it can be increased, or the\r\nrichest or poorest parts of the milk given, at pleasure.”\r\n\r\nIn these districts, where, probably, the feeding and management of\r\ncalves is as well and judiciously conducted as in any other part of\r\nBritain, the farmers’ wives and daughters, or female domestics, have the\r\nprincipal charge of young calves; and they are, no doubt, much better\r\ncalculated for this duty than men, since they are more inclined to be\r\ngentle and patient. The utmost gentleness should always be observed in\r\nthe treatment of all stock; but especially of milch cows, and calves\r\ndesigned for the dairy. Persevering kindness and patience will, almost\r\ninvariably, overcome the most obstinate natures; while rough and\r\nungentle handling will be repaid in a quiet kind of way, perhaps, by\r\nwithholding the milk, which will always have a tendency to dry a cow up;\r\nor, what is nearly as bad, by kicking, and other modes of revenge, which\r\noften contribute to the personal discomfort of the milker. The\r\ndisposition of the cow is greatly modified, if not, indeed, wholly\r\nformed, by her treatment while young; and therefore it is best to handle\r\ncalves as much as possible, and make pets of them, lead them with a\r\nhalter, and caress them in various ways. Calves managed in this way will\r\nalways be docile, and suffer themselves to be approached and handled\r\nboth in the pasture and the barn.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the use of hay-tea, often used in this country, but more\r\ncommon abroad, where greater care and attention is usually given to the\r\ndetails of breeding, Youatt says: “At the end of three or four days, _or\r\nperhaps a week, or even a fortnight_, after a calf has been dropped, and\r\nthe first passages have been cleansed _by allowing it to drink as much\r\nof the cow’s milk as it feels inclined for_, let the quantity usually\r\nallotted for a meal be mixed, consisting, for _the first week_, of three\r\nparts milk and one part hay-tea. _The only nourishing infusion of hay is\r\nthat which is made from the best and sweetest hay, cut by a chaff-cutter\r\ninto pieces about two inches long_, and put into an earthen vessel; over\r\nthis boiling water should be poured, and the whole allowed to stand for\r\ntwo hours, during which time it ought to be kept carefully closed. After\r\nthe first week, the proportions of milk and hay-tea may be equal; then\r\ncomposed of two thirds of hay-tea and one of milk; and at length one\r\nfourth part of milk will be sufficient. This food should be given to the\r\ncalf in a lukewarm state _at least three, if not four times a day, in\r\nquantities averaging three quarts at each meal_, but gradually\r\nincreasing to four quarts _as the calf grows older_. _Towards the end of\r\nthe second month_, beside the usual quantity given at each meal\r\n(composed of three parts of the infusion and one of milk), a small wisp\r\nor bundle of hay is to be laid before the calf, which will gradually\r\ncome to eat it; but, if the weather is favorable, as in the month of\r\nMay, the beast may be turned out to graze in a fine, sweet pasture, well\r\nsheltered from the wind and sun. This diet may be continued until\r\ntowards the latter end of the third month, when, if the calf grazes\r\nheartily, each meal may be reduced to less than a quart of milk, with\r\nhay-water; or skimmed milk or fresh butter-milk may be substituted for\r\nnew milk. At the expiration of the third month the animal will hardly\r\nrequire to be fed by hand, though, if this should still be necessary,\r\none quart of the infusion given daily, and which during the summer need\r\nnot be warmed, will be sufficient.” The hay-tea should be made fresh\r\nevery two days, as it soon loses its nutritious quality.\r\n\r\nThis and other preparations are given not because they are better than\r\nmilk, than which nothing is better adapted to fatten a calf, or promote\r\nits growth, but simply to economize by providing the most suitable and\r\ncheaper substitutes. Experience shows that the first two or three calves\r\nare smaller than those that follow; and hence, unless they are\r\npure-bred, and to be kept for the blood, they are not generally thought\r\nto be so desirable to raise for the dairy as the third or fourth, and\r\nthose that come after, up to the age of nine or ten years. On this point\r\nopinions differ.\r\n\r\nAccording to the comparative experiments of a German agriculturist, cows\r\nwhich as calves had been allowed to suckle their dams from two to four\r\nweeks brought calves which weighed only from thirty-five to forty-eight\r\npounds; while others, which, as calves, had been allowed to suckle from\r\nfive to eight weeks, brought calves weighing from sixty to eighty\r\npounds. It is difficult to see how there can be so great a difference,\r\nif, indeed, there is any; but it may be worthy of careful observation\r\nand experiment, and as such it is stated in this connection. The\r\nincreased size of the calf would be due to the larger size to which the\r\ncow would attain; and if as a calf she were allowed to run with her dam\r\nin the pasture four or five months, taking all the milk she wanted, she\r\nwould doubtless be kept growing on in a thriving condition. But taking a\r\ncalf from the cow at four or even eight weeks must check its growth to\r\nsome extent, and this may be avoided by feeding liberally, and bringing\r\nup by hand.\r\n\r\nAfter the calf is fully weaned, there is nothing very peculiar in the\r\ngeneral management. A young animal will require for the first few\r\nmonths--say up to the age of six months--an average of five or six\r\npounds daily of good hay, or its equivalent. At the age of six months it\r\nwill require from four and a half to five pounds, and at the end of the\r\nyear from three and a half to four pounds of good hay, or its\r\nequivalent, for every one hundred pounds of its live weight; or, in\r\nother words, about three and a half or four per cent. of its live\r\nweight. At two years old it will require three and a half, and some\r\nmonths later three per cent. of its live weight daily in good hay or its\r\nequivalent. Indian-corn fodder, either green or cured, forms an\r\nexcellent and wholesome food at this age.\r\n\r\nThe heifer should not be pampered, nor yet poorly fed or half starved,\r\nso as to receive a check in her growth. An abundant supply of good\r\nhealthy dairy food and drink will do all that is necessary up to the\r\ntime of having her first calf, which should not ordinarily be till the\r\nage of three years, though some choose to allow them to come in at two\r\nor a little over, on the ground that it early stimulates the secretion\r\nof milk, and that this will increase the milking propensity through\r\nlife. This is undoubtedly the case, as a general rule; but I think\r\ngreater injury is done by checking the growth, unless the heifer has\r\nbeen fed up to large size and full development from the start, in which\r\ncase she may perhaps take the bull at fifteen or eighteen months without\r\ninjury. I have had several come in as early as two years, and one at\r\nless than twenty months. This last was not by design, however, and I\r\nwould rather have given a considerable sum than had it happen, as she\r\nwas an exceedingly beautiful pure-bred Jersey, and I was desirous to\r\nhave her attain to good size and growth. Even if a heifer comes in at\r\ntwo years, it is generally thought desirable to let her run farrow for\r\nthe following year, which will promote her growth and more perfect\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe feeding which young stock often get is not such as is calculated to\r\nmake good-sized or valuable cattle of them. They are often fed on the\r\npoorest of hay or straw through the winter, not unfrequently left\r\nexposed to cold, unprotected and unhoused, and thus stinted in their\r\ngrowth. This seems to me to be the very worst economy, or rather no\r\neconomy at all. Properly viewed, it is an extravagant wastefulness which\r\nno farmer can afford. No animal develops its good points under such\r\ntreatment; and if the starving system is to be followed at all, it had\r\nbetter be after the age of two or three years, when the animal’s\r\nconstitution has attained strength and vigor to resist ill treatment.\r\n\r\nTo raise up first-rate milkers, it is absolutely necessary to feed on\r\ndairy food even while young. No matter how fine the breed is, if the\r\ncalf is raised on poor, short feed, it will never be so good a milker as\r\nif raised on better keeping; and hence, in dairy districts, where calves\r\nare raised at all, they ought to be allowed the best pasture during the\r\nsummer, and good sweet and wholesome food during the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCULTURE OF GRASSES AND OTHER PLANTS RECOMMENDED FOR FODDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the grasses in summer, and hay in winter, form the\r\nmost natural and important food for milch cows; and whatever other crops\r\ncome in as additional, these will form the basis of all systems of\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive qualities of the grasses differ widely; and their value as\r\nfeed for cows will depend, to a considerable extent, on the management\r\nof pastures and mowing-lands.\r\n\r\nIf the turf of an old pasture is carefully examined, it will be found to\r\ncontain a large variety of grasses and plants adapted for forage; some\r\nof them valuable for one purpose, and some for another. Some of them,\r\nthough possessing a lower percentage of nutritive constituents than\r\nothers, are particularly esteemed for an early and luxuriant growth,\r\nfurnishing a sweet feed in early spring, before other grasses appear;\r\nsome of them, for starting more rapidly than others, after being eaten\r\noff by cattle, and consequently of great value as pasture grasses. Most\r\ngrasses will be found to be of a social character, and to do best in a\r\nlarge mixture with other varieties.\r\n\r\nIn forming a mixture for pasture grasses, the peculiarities of each\r\nspecies should, therefore, be regarded: as the time of flowering, the\r\nhabits of growth, the soil and location on which it grows best, and\r\nother characteristics. Among the grasses found on cultivated lands, in\r\nthis country, the following are considered as among the most valuable\r\nfor ordinary farm cultivation; some of them adapted to pastures, and\r\nothers almost exclusively to mowing and the hay crop: Timothy (_Phleum\r\npratense_). Meadow Foxtail (_Alopecurus pratensis_). June, or Kentucky\r\nBlue Grass (_Poa pratensis_). Fowl meadow (_Poa serotina_).\r\nRough-stalked Meadow (_Poa trivialis_). Orchard Grass (_Dactylis\r\nglomerata_). Perennial Rye Grass (_Lolium perenne_). Italian Rye Grass\r\n(_Lolium italicum_). Redtop (_Agrostis vulgaris_). English Bent\r\n(_Agrostis alba_). Meadow Fescue (_Festuca pratensis_). Tall Oat Grass\r\n(_Arrhenatherum avenaceum_). Sweet-scented Vernal (_Anthoxanthemum\r\nodoratum_). Hungarian Grass (_Panicum Germanicum_). Red Clover\r\n(_Trifolium pratense_). White or Dutch Clover (_Trifolium repens_), and\r\nsome others.\r\n\r\nOf these, the most valuable, all things considered, is the first, or\r\nTimothy (Fig. 56b). It forms a large proportion of what is commonly\r\ncalled English, or in some sections meadow hay, though it originated and\r\nwas first cultivated in this country. It contains a large percentage of\r\nnutritive matter, in comparison with other agricultural grasses. It\r\nthrives best on moist, peaty, or loamy soils, of medium tenacity, and is\r\nnot well suited to very light, sandy lands. On very moist soils its root\r\nis almost always fibrous; while on dry and loamy ones it is bulbous. On\r\nsoils of the former description, which it especially affects, its growth\r\nis rapid, and its yield of hay large, sometimes amounting to three and\r\nfour tons to the acre, depending much, of course, on cultivation. But,\r\nthough very valuable for hay, it is not adapted to pastures, as it will\r\nneither endure severe grazing, nor is its aftermath to be compared with\r\nmeadow foxtail, and some of the other grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56b. Timothy grass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57b. June grass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE GRASS (Fig. 57b), better known in some sections as Kentucky Blue\r\ngrass, is very common in most sections of the country, especially on\r\nlimestone lands, forming a large part of the turf, wherever it\r\nflourishes, and being universally esteemed as a pasture grass. It starts\r\nearly, but varies much in size and appearance, according to the soil;\r\ngrowing in some places with the utmost luxuriance, and forming the\r\npredominant grass; in others, yielding to the other species. If cut at\r\nthe time of flowering, or a few days after, it makes a good and\r\nnutritive hay, though it is surpassed in nutritive qualities by several\r\nof the other grasses. It starts slowly after being cut, especially if\r\nnot cut very early. But its herbage is fine and uniform, and admirably\r\nadapted to lawns, growing well in almost all soils, though it does not\r\nendure very severe droughts. It withstands, however, the frosts of\r\nwinter better than most other grasses.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, a section where it attains its highest perfection and\r\nluxuriance, ripening its seed about the 10th of June, and in latitudes\r\nsouth of that, it sometimes continues green through the mild winters. It\r\nrequires three or four years to become well set, after sowing, and it\r\ndoes not attain its highest yield as a pasture grass till the sod is\r\neven older than that. It is not, therefore, suited to alternate\r\nhusbandry, where land usually remains in grass but two or three years\r\nbefore being ploughed up. In Kentucky it is sown any time in winter when\r\nthe snow is on the ground three or four quarts of seed being used to the\r\nacre. In spring the seeds germinate, when the sprouts are exceedingly\r\nfine and delicate. Stock is not allowed on it the first year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58b. Meadow Foxtail.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Orchard grass.]\r\n\r\nThe MEADOW FOXTAIL (Fig. 58b) is also an excellent pasture grass. It\r\nsomewhat resembles Timothy, but is earlier, has a softer spike, and\r\nthrives on all soils except the dryest. Its growth is rapid, and it is\r\ngreatly relished by stock of all kinds. Its stalk and leaves are too few\r\nand light for a field crop, and it shrinks too much in curing to be\r\nvaluable for hay. It flourishes best in a rich, moist, and rather strong\r\nsoil, sending up a luxuriant aftermath when cut or grazed off, which is\r\nmuch more valuable, both in quantity and nutritive value, than the first\r\ncrop. In all lands designed for permanent pasture, therefore, it should\r\nform a considerable part of a mixture. It will endure almost any amount\r\nof forcing, by liquid manures, or irrigation. It requires three or four\r\nyears, after sowing, to gain a firm footing in the soil. The seed is\r\ncovered with the soft and woolly husks of the flower, and is\r\nconsequently light; weighing but five pounds to the bushel, and\r\ncontaining seventy-six thousand seeds to the ounce.\r\n\r\nThe ORCHARD GRASS, or ROUGH COCKSFOOT (Fig. 59), for pastures, stands\r\npreëminent. This is a native of this country, and was introduced into\r\nEngland, from Virginia, in 1764, since which time its cultivation has\r\nextended into every country of Europe, where it is universally held in\r\nvery high estimation. The fact of its being very palatable to stock of\r\nall kinds, its rapidity of growth, and the luxuriance of its aftermath,\r\nwith its power of enduring the cropping of cattle, have given it a very\r\nhigh reputation, especially as a pasture grass. It blossoms earlier than\r\nTimothy; when green is equally relished by milch cows; requires to be\r\nfed closer, to prevent its forming tufts and growing up to seed, when it\r\nbecomes hard and wiry, and loses much of its nutritive quality. As it\r\nblossoms about the same time, it forms an admirable mixture with red\r\nclover, either for permanent pasture or mowing. It resists drought, and\r\nis less exhausting to the soil than either rye grass or Timothy. The\r\nseed weighs twelve pounds to the bushel, and when sown alone requires\r\nabout two bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Rough-stalked Meadow grass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Rye grass.]\r\n\r\nThe ROUGH-STALKED MEADOW GRASS (Fig. 60) is somewhat less common than\r\nJune grass, but is considered as equally valuable. It grows best on\r\nmoist, sheltered meadows, where it flowers in June and July. It is\r\neasily distinguished from June grass, by having a rough sheath, while\r\nthe latter has a smooth one, and by having a fibrous root, while the\r\nroot of June grass is creeping. It possesses very considerable nutritive\r\nqualities, and comes to perfection at a desirable time; is exceedingly\r\nrelished by cattle, horses, and sheep. For suitable soils it should form\r\na portion of a mixture of seeds, producing, in mixture with other\r\ngrasses which serve to shelter it, a large yield of hay, far above the\r\naverage of grass usually grown on a similar soil. It should be cut when\r\nthe seed is formed. Seven pounds of seed to the acre will produce a good\r\nsward. The grass loses about seventy per cent. of its weight in drying.\r\nThe nutritive qualities of its aftermath exceed very considerably those\r\nof the crop cut in the flower or in the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWL MEADOW GRASS is another indigenous species, of great value for low\r\nand marshy grounds, where it flourishes best; and, if cut and properly\r\ncured, makes a sweet and nutritious hay, which, from its fineness, is\r\neaten by cows without waste. According to Sinclair, who experimented,\r\nwith the aid of Sir Humphrey Davy, to ascertain its comparative\r\nnutritive properties, it is superior, in this respect, to either meadow\r\nfoxtail, orchard grass, or tall meadow oat grass; but it is probable\r\nthat he somewhat overrates it. If allowed to stand till nearly ripe, it\r\nfalls down, but sends up innumerable flowering stems from the joints, so\r\nthat it continues green and luxuriant till late in the season. It\r\nthrives best in mixture with other grasses, and deserves a prominent\r\nplace in all mixtures for rich, moist pastures, and low mowing-lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE GRASS (Fig. 61) has a far higher reputation abroad than in this\r\ncountry, and probably with reason; for it is better adapted to a wet and\r\nuncertain climate than to a dry and hot one. It varies exceedingly,\r\ndepending much on soil and culture; but, when cut in the blossom to make\r\ninto hay, it possesses very considerable nutritive power. If allowed to\r\nget too ripe, it is hard and wiry, and not relished by cows. The change\r\nfrom a juicy and nutritious plant to woody fibre, possessing but little\r\nsoluble matter, is very rapid. Properly managed, however, it is a\r\ntolerably good grass, though not to be compared to Timothy, or orchard\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN RYE GRASS (Fig. 62) has also been cultivated to considerable\r\nextent in this country, but with less satisfactory results than are\r\nobtained from it in Europe, where it endures all climates, giving better\r\ncrops, both in quantity and quality, than the perennial rye grass. It is\r\none of the greatest gluttons of all the grasses, and luxuriates in\r\nfrequent irrigation with liquid manure, though it is said to stand the\r\ndrought very well. The soils best adapted to it are rich, moist, and\r\nfertile, of medium tenacity; and it is admirably adapted to the purposes\r\nof soiling, as it endures repeated cutting, rapidly sending up luxuriant\r\ncrops. For rich soils near the barn, used for the growth of crops for\r\nsoiling, therefore, it may be confidently used as a profitable addition\r\nto our list of cultivated grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Italian Rye grass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Redtop.]\r\n\r\n\r\nREDTOP (Fig. 63) is a grass familiar to every farmer in the country. It\r\nis the Herd’s grass of Pennsylvania, while in New York and New England\r\nit is known by a great variety of names, and assumes a great variety of\r\nforms, according to the soil in which it grows. It is well adapted to\r\nalmost every soil, though it seems to prefer a moist loam. It makes a\r\nprofitable crop for spending, in the form of hay, though its yield is\r\nless than that of Timothy. It is well suited to our permanent pastures,\r\nwhere it should be fed close, otherwise it becomes wiry and\r\ninnutritious, and cattle refuse it. It stands the climate of the\r\ncountry as well as any other grass, and so forms a valuable part of any\r\nmixture for pastures and permanent mowing-lands; but it is probably\r\nrather overrated by us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. English Bent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Meadow Fescue.]\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH BENT (Fig. 64), known also by a great variety of other names, is\r\nalso largely cultivated in some sections. It closely resembles redtop,\r\nbut may be distinguished from it by the roughness of the sheaths when\r\nthe hand is drawn from above downwards. It possesses much the same\r\nqualities as redtop.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW FESCUE (Fig. 65) is one of the most common of the fescue grasses,\r\nand is said to be the Randall grass of Virginia. It is an excellent\r\npasture grass, forming a very considerable portion of the turf of old\r\npastures and fields; and is more extensively propagated and diffused by\r\nthe fact that it ripens its seeds before most other grasses are cut, and\r\nsheds them to spring up and cover the ground. Its long and tender leaves\r\nare much relished by cattle. It is rarely sown in this country,\r\nnotwithstanding its great and acknowledged value as a pasture grass. If\r\nsown at all, it should be in mixture with other grasses, as orchard\r\ngrass, rye grass, or June grass. It is of much greater value at the time\r\nof flowering than when the seed is ripe.\r\n\r\nThe TALL OAT GRASS (Fig. 66) is the Ray grass of France. It furnishes a\r\nluxuriant supply of foliage, is valuable either for hay or for pasture,\r\nand has been especially recommended for soiling purposes, on account of\r\nits early and luxuriant growth. It is often found on the borders of\r\nfields and hedges, woods and pastures, and is sometimes very plenty in\r\nmowing-lands. After being sown it shoots up a very thick aftermath, and\r\non this account, partly, is regarded as nearly equal for excellence to\r\nthe common foxtail.\r\n\r\nIt grows spontaneously on deep, sandy soils, when once naturalized. It\r\nhas been cultivated to a considerable extent in this country, and is\r\nesteemed by those who know it mainly for its early, rapid, and late\r\ngrowth, making it very well calculated as a permanent pasture grass. It\r\nwill succeed on tenacious clover soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Tall Oat grass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Sweet-scented Vernal.]\r\n\r\nThe SWEET-SCENTED VERNAL GRASS (Fig. 67) is one of the earliest in\r\nspring and one of the latest in autumn; and this habit of growth is one\r\nof its chief excellences, as it is neither a nutritious grass nor very\r\npalatable to stock of any kind, nor does it yield a very good crop. It\r\nis very common all over New England and the Middle States, coming into\r\nold worn-out fields and moist pastures spontaneously, and along every\r\nroadside. It derives its name from its sweetness of smell when partially\r\nwilted, or crushed in the hand, and it is this chiefly that gives the\r\ndelicious fragrance to all new-mown hay. It is almost the only grass\r\nthat possesses a strongly-marked aromatic odor, which is imparted to\r\nother grasses with which it is cured. Its seed weighs eight pounds to\r\nthe bushel. In mixtures for permanent pastures it may be of some value.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARIAN GRASS, or Millet (Fig. 68), is an annual forage plant,\r\nintroduced into France in 1815, and more recently into this country. It\r\ngerminates readily and withstands the drought remarkably, remaining\r\ngreen when other grasses are parched and dried up. It has numerous\r\nsucculent leaves, which furnish an abundance of sweet fodder, greatly\r\nrelished by stock of all kinds. It attains its greatest luxuriance on\r\nsoils of medium consistency and richness, but does very well on light\r\nand dry plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. Red Clover.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Hungarian grass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRED CLOVER (Fig. 69) is an artificial grass of the leguminous family,\r\nand one of the most valuable of cultivated plants for feeding to dairy\r\ncows. It flourishes best on tenacious soils and stiff loams. Its growth\r\nis rapid, and a few months after sowing are sufficient to supply an\r\nabundant sweet and nutritious food. In the climate of New England clover\r\nshould be sown in the spring of the year, while most of the natural\r\ngrasses do far better sown in the fall. It is often sown with perfect\r\nsuccess on the late snows of March or April, and soon finds its way down\r\ninto the soil and takes a vigorous root. It is valuable not only as a\r\nforage plant, but as shading the ground, and thereby increasing its\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of clover among the cultivated plants of the farm has\r\ndone more, perhaps, for modern agriculture than that of any other single\r\nplant. It has now come to be considered indispensable in all good dairy\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. White Clover.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE CLOVER (Fig. 70), often called Honeysuckle, is also widely\r\ndiffused over this country, to which it is undoubtedly indigenous. As a\r\nmixture in all pasture grasses it holds a very high rank, as it is\r\nexceedingly sweet and nutritious, and relished by stock of all kinds. It\r\ngrows most luxuriantly in moist grounds and moist seasons, but easily\r\naccommodates itself to a great variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the mixtures of grass-seeds most profitable for the\r\ndairy farmer, no universal rule can be given, as they depend very much\r\nupon the nature of the soil and the locality. The most important point\r\nto be observed, and one in which we, as a body, are perhaps most\r\ndeficient, is to use a large number of species, with smaller quantities\r\nof each than those most commonly used. This is nature’s rule; for, in\r\nexamining the turf of a rich old pasture, we shall find a large number\r\nof different species growing together, while, if we examine the turf of\r\na field sown with only one or two different species, we find a far less\r\nnumber of plants to the square foot, even after the sod is fairly set.\r\nNo improvement in grass culture is more important, it seems to me. I\r\nhave suggested, in another place, a large number of mixtures adapted to\r\nthe different varieties of soil and circumstance, together with the\r\nreasons for the mixture in many instances. (See _A Practical Treatise on\r\nGrasses and Forage Plants_, comprising their Natural History,\r\nComparative Nutritive Value, Methods of Cultivating, Cutting, and\r\nCuring, and the Management of Grass Lands, &c. 236 pp. 8vo., with\r\nillustrations.) As an instance of what I should consider an improvement\r\non our ordinary mixtures for _permanent pastures_, I would suggest the\r\nfollowing as likely to give satisfactory results, dependent, of course,\r\nto a considerable extent, on the nature and preparation of the soil:\r\n\r\n  Meadow Foxtail, flowering in May and June,                 2  pounds\r\n  Orchard Grass, flowering in May and June,                  6    “\r\n  Sweet-scented Vernal, flowering in April and May,          1    “\r\n  Meadow Fescue, flowering in May and June,                  2    “\r\n  Redtop, flowering in June and July,                        2    “\r\n  June Grass, flowering in May and June,                     4    “\r\n  Italian Rye Grass, flowering in June,                      4    “\r\n  Perennial Rye Grass, flowering in June,                    6    “\r\n  Timothy, flowering in June and July,                       3    “\r\n  Rough-stalked Meadow Grass, flowering in June and July,    2    “\r\n  Perennial Clover, flowering in June,                       3    “\r\n  White Clover, flowering in May to September,            5-40    “\r\n\r\nFor mowing-lands the mixture would, of course, be somewhat changed. The\r\nmeadow foxtail and sweet-scented vernal would be left out entirely, and\r\nsome six or eight pounds added to the Timothy and red clover. The\r\nproper time to lay down lands to grass in the latitude of New England is\r\nAugust or September, and no grain crop should be sown with the seed.\r\n\r\nStiff or clayey pastures should never be over-stocked, but when fed\r\npretty close the grasses are far sweeter and more nutritious than when\r\nthey are allowed to grow up rank and coarse; and if, by a want of\r\nsufficient feeding, they get the start of the stock, and grow into rank\r\ntufts, they should be cut and removed, when a fresh grass will start up,\r\nsimilar to the aftermath of mowing-lands, which will be greedily eaten.\r\nGrasses for curing into hay should be cut either at the time of\r\nflowering or just before, especially if designed for milch cows. They\r\nare then more succulent and juicy, and, if properly cured, form the\r\nsweetest food.\r\n\r\nGrass cut in the blossom will make more milk than if allowed to stand\r\nlater. Cut a little before the blossoming, it will make more than when\r\nin the blossom; and the cows prefer it, which is by no means an\r\nunimportant consideration, since their tastes should always be\r\nconsulted. Grass cut somewhat green, and properly cured, is next to\r\nfresh, green grass in palatable and nutritive qualities. And so a\r\nsensible practical farmer writes me: “The time of cutting grass depends\r\nvery much upon the use you wish to make of it. If for working oxen and\r\nhorses, I would let it stand till a little out of the blossom; but if to\r\nfeed out to new milch cows in the winter, I would prefer to cut it very\r\ngreen. It is then worth for the making of milk in the winter almost\r\ndouble that cut later.” Every farmer knows the milk-producing properties\r\nof rowen, which is generally cut before it blossoms.\r\n\r\nNo operation on the farm is of greater importance to the dairyman than\r\nthe cutting of his grass and the manner of curing hay, and in this\r\nrespect the practice over the country generally is susceptible of very\r\ngreat improvement. The chief object is to preserve the sweetness and\r\nsucculence of grass in its natural state, so far as it is possible; and\r\nthis object cannot be gained by exposing it too long to the scorching\r\nsuns and the drenching rains to which we are liable in this climate. We\r\ngenerally try to make our hay too much.\r\n\r\nAs to the best modes of curing clover, my own experience and observation\r\naccord with that of several practical farmers, who write me as follows:\r\n“My method of curing clover is this: What is mown in the morning I leave\r\nin the swath, to be turned over early in the afternoon. At about four\r\no’clock, or while it is still warm, I put it into small cocks with a\r\nfork, and, if the weather is favorable, it may be housed on the fourth\r\nor fifth day, the cocks being turned over on the morning of the day it\r\nis to be carted. By so doing all the heads and leaves are saved, and\r\nthese are worth more than the stems. This has been my method for the\r\nlast ten years. For new milch cows in the winter I think there is\r\nnothing better. It will make them give as great a flow of milk as any\r\nhay, unless it be good rowen.” Another says: “When the weather bids fair\r\nto be good, I mow it after the dew is off, and cock it up after being\r\nwilted, using the fork instead of rolling with the rake, and let it\r\nremain several days, when it is fit to put into the barn.” And another:\r\n“I mow my clover in the forenoon, and towards night of the same day I\r\ntake forks and pitch it into cocks and let it stand till it cures. The\r\nday I cart it, I turn the cocks over, so as to air the lower part. I\r\nthen put it into the mow with all the leaves and heads on, and it is as\r\nnice and green as green tea. I think it worth for milch cows and sheep\r\nas much per ton as English hay.” And still another: “I have found no\r\nbetter hay for farm stock than good clover, cut in season. For milch\r\ncows it is much better than Timothy. The rowen crop is better than any\r\nother for calves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN makes an exceedingly valuable fodder, both as a means of\r\ncarrying a herd of milch cows through our severe droughts of summer, and\r\nas an article for soiling cows kept in the stall. No dairy farmer will\r\nneglect to sow an extent in proportion to the number of cows he keeps.\r\nThe most common practice is to sow in drills from two and a half to\r\nthree feet apart, on land well tilled and thoroughly manured, making the\r\ndrills from six to ten inches wide with the plough, manuring in the\r\nfurrow, dropping the corn about two inches apart, and covering with the\r\nhoe. In this mode of culture the cultivator may be used between the rows\r\nwhen the corn is from six to twelve inches high, and unless the ground\r\nis very weedy no other after culture is generally needed. The first\r\nsowing usually takes place about the 20th of May, and this is succeeded\r\nby other sowings at intervals of a week or ten days, till July, in order\r\nto have a succession of green fodder. But, if it is designed to cut it\r\nup to cure for winter use, an early sowing is generally preferred, in\r\norder to be able to cure it in warm weather, in August or early in\r\nSeptember. Sown in this way, about three or four bushels of corn are\r\nrequired for an acre, since, if sown thickly, the fodder is better, the\r\nstalks smaller, and the waste less.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in curing corn cultivated for this purpose, and\r\nafter the methods spoken of, arises mainly from the fact that it comes\r\nat a season when the weather is often colder, the days shorter, and the\r\ndews heavier, than when the curing of hay takes place. Nor is the curing\r\nof corn cut up green so easy and simple as that of drying the stalks of\r\nIndian corn cut above the ear, as in our common practice of topping. The\r\nplant is then riper, less juicy, and cures more readily.\r\n\r\nThe method sometimes adopted is to cut and tie into small bundles, after\r\nit is somewhat wilted, and stook upon the ground, where it is allowed to\r\nstand, subject to all the changes of the weather, with only the\r\nprotection of the stook itself. The stooks consist of bunches of stalks\r\nfirst bound in small bundles, and are made sufficiently large to prevent\r\nthe wind from blowing them over. The arms are thrown around the tops to\r\nbring them together as closely as possible, when the tops are broken\r\nover or twisted together, or otherwise fastened, in order to make the\r\nstook “shed the rain” as well as possible. In this condition they stand\r\nout till sufficiently dried to put into the barn. Corn fodder is very\r\nexcellent for young dairy stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON MILLET (_Panicum miliaceum_) is another very valuable crop for\r\nfodder in soiling, or to cure for winter use, but especially to feed out\r\nduring our usual periods of drought. Many varieties of millet are\r\ncultivated in this country, the ground being prepared and treated as for\r\noats. If designed to cut for green fodder, half a bushel of seed to the\r\nacre should be used; if to ripen seed, twelve quarts, sown broad-cast,\r\nabout the last of May or early in June. A moist loam or muck is the best\r\nadapted to millet; but I have seen very great crops grown on dry upland.\r\nIt is very palatable and nutritious for milch cows, both green and when\r\nproperly cured. The curing should be very much like clover, care being\r\ntaken not to over-dry it. For fodder, either green or cured, it is cut\r\nbefore ripening. In this state all cattle eat it as readily as green\r\ncorn, and a less extent will feed them. Millet is worthy of a\r\nwidely-extended cultivation, particularly on dairy farms. Indian millet\r\n(_Sorghum vulgare_) is another cultivated variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nRYE, as a fodder plant, is chiefly valuable for its early growth in\r\nspring. It is usually sown in September or October, from the middle to\r\nthe end of September being, perhaps, the most desirable time, on land\r\npreviously cultivated and in good condition. If designed to ripen only,\r\na bushel of seed is required to the acre, evenly sown; but, if intended\r\nfor early fodder in spring, two or two and a half bushels per acre of\r\nseed should be used. On warm land the rye can be cut green the last of\r\nApril or first of May; and care should be taken to cut early, as, if\r\nallowed to advance too far towards maturity, the stalk becomes hard and\r\nunpalatable to cows.\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS are also sometimes used for soiling, or for feeding green, to eke\r\nout a scanty supply of pasture feed; And for this purpose they are\r\nvaluable. They should be sown on well-tilled and well-manured land,\r\nabout four bushels to the acre, towards the last of April or first of\r\nMay. If the whole crop is to be used as green fodder, five bushels of\r\nseed will not be too much on strong, good soil. They will be\r\nsufficiently grown to cut by the first of July, or in some sections\r\nearlier, depending on location.\r\n\r\nThe CHINESE SUGAR-CANE also may deserve attention as a fodder plant.\r\nExperiments hitherto made seem to show that when properly cultivated,\r\nand cut at the right time, it is a palatable and nutritious plant, while\r\nmany of the failures have been the result of too early cutting. For a\r\nfodder crop the drill culture is preferable, both on account of the\r\nlarger yield obtained and to prevent it from becoming too hard and\r\nstalky.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTATO (_Solanum tuberosum_) is the first of the root crops to be\r\nmentioned. This produces a large quantity of milk, though the quality\r\nis inferior. The market value of this root is, at the present time, too\r\ngreat to allow of feeding extensively with it, even in milk-dairies,\r\nwhere it is most valuable as food for cows; still, there are locations\r\nwhere it may be judicious to cultivate this root for dairy feed, and in\r\nall circumstances there is a certain portion of the crop of unmarketable\r\nsize, which will be of value fed to milch cows or swine. It should be\r\nplanted in April or May, but in many sections in June, on good mellow\r\nsoil, first thoroughly ploughed and harrowed, then furrowed three feet\r\napart, and manured in the furrows with a mixture of ashes, plaster of\r\nParis, and salt. The seed may be dropped in the furrows, one foot apart,\r\nafter the drill system, or in hills, two and a half or three feet apart,\r\nto be covered with the plough by simply turning the furrows back, after\r\nwhich the whole should be rolled with the field roller, where it can be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIf the land is not already in good heart from continued cultivation, a\r\nfew loads of barn-yard manure may be spread, and ploughed under by the\r\nfirst ploughing. Used in this way, it is far less liable to cause the\r\nrot than when put in the hill. If a sufficient quantity of wood-ashes is\r\nnot at hand, sifted coal-ashes will answer the purpose, and are said to\r\nbe valuable as a preventive of the rot. In this way one man, two boys,\r\nand a horse, can plant from three to four acres a day on mellow land. I\r\nhave planted two acres a day on the sod, the manure being first spread\r\non the grass, a furrow made by a yoke of oxen and one man, another\r\nfollowing after and dropping, a foot apart, along the outer edge of the\r\nfurrow on the grass. By quick work, one hand can nearly keep up with the\r\nplough in dropping. When arrived at the end of the piece, a back furrow\r\nis turned up to the potatoes, and a good ploughman will cover nearly\r\nall without difficulty. On the return-furrow the man or boy who dropped\r\nfollows after, covering up any that may be left or displaced, and\r\nsmoothing off the top of the back-furrows where necessary. Potatoes thus\r\nplanted came out as fine as I ever saw any.\r\n\r\nThe cost of cultivation in this mode, it must be evident, is but\r\ntrifling compared with the slower method of hand-planting. The plan will\r\nrequire a skilful ploughman, a quick, active lad, and a good yoke of\r\noxen, and the extent of the work will depend somewhat on the state of\r\nthe turf. The nutritive equivalent in potatoes for one hundred pounds of\r\ngood hay is 3.19 pounds; that is, it will take 319 pounds of potatoes to\r\nafford the same amount of nourishment as one pound of hay. The great\r\nvalue of roots is as a change or condiment, calculated to keep the\r\nanimal in a healthy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARROT (_Daucus carota_) is somewhat extensively fed, and is a\r\nvaluable root for milch cows. This, like the potato, has been cultivated\r\nand improved from a wild plant. Carrots require a deep, warm, mellow\r\nsoil, thoroughly cultivated, but clean and free from weed-seed. The\r\ndifference between a very good profit and a loss on the crop depends\r\nmuch on the use of land and manures perfectly free from foul seeds of\r\nany kind. Ashes, guano, sea-weed, ground bone, and other similar\r\nsubstances, or thoroughly-rotted and fermented compost, will answer the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAfter ploughing deep, and harrowing carefully, the seed should be sown\r\nwith a seed-sower, in drills about eighteen inches apart, at the rate of\r\nfour pounds to the acre, about the middle or twentieth of May. The\r\ndifference between sowing the fifteenth of May and the tenth of June in\r\nNew England is said to be nearly one third in the crop on an average of\r\nyears. In weeding, a little wheel-hoe is invaluable, as with it a large\r\npart of the labor of cultivation is saved. A skilful hand can run this\r\nhoe within half an inch of the young plants without injury, and go over\r\na large space in the course of a day, if the land was properly prepared\r\nin the first place.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer should always plan to economize labor. That is the\r\ngreat item of expense on the farm. I do not mean that he should try to\r\nshirk or avoid work, but that he should make the least amount of work\r\naccomplish the largest and most profitable results. Labor-saving\r\nmachinery on the farm is applied not to reduce the number of hours’\r\nlabor, or to make the owner a man of leisure,--who is, generally, the\r\nunhappiest man in the world,--but to enable him to accomplish the\r\ngreatest results in the same time that he would be compelled to labor to\r\nobtain smaller ones.\r\n\r\nCarrots will continue to grow and increase in size late into the fall.\r\nWhen ready to dig, plough around as near to the outside rows as\r\npossible, turning the furrow away from the row. Then take out the\r\ncarrots, pulling off the tops, and throw the carrots and tops into\r\nseparate heaps on the ploughed furrows. In this way a man and two boys\r\ncan harvest and put into the cellar over a hundred bushels a day.\r\n\r\nThe TURNIP (_Brassica rapa_) and the Swedish turnip or ruta baga\r\n(_Brassica campestris_) are also largely cultivated as a field crop to\r\nfeed to stock; and for this purpose numberless varieties are used,\r\nfurnishing a great amount of succulent and nutritious food, late into\r\nwinter, and, if well kept, late into spring. The chief objection to the\r\nturnip is that it taints the milk. This may be remedied, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, if not wholly, by the use of salt, or salt hay, and\r\nby feeding at the time of milking, or immediately after, or by steaming\r\nbefore feeding, or putting a small quantity of the solution of nitre\r\ninto the pail, and milking upon it.\r\n\r\nTurnips may be sown any time in June, in rich land, well mellowed by\r\ncultivation. Very large crops are often obtained sown as late as the\r\nmiddle of July, or first of August, on an inverted sod. The Michigan or\r\ndouble-mould-board plough leaves the land light, and in admirable\r\ncondition to harrow, and drill in turnips. A successful root-grower last\r\nyear cut two tons of hay to the acre, on the 23d of June, and after it\r\nwas removed from the land spread eight cords of rotten kelp to the acre,\r\nand ploughed in; after which about three cords of fine old compost\r\nmanure were used to the acre, which was sown, with ruta baga seed, in\r\ndrills, three feet apart, plants thinned to eight or ten inches in the\r\ndrill. No after cultivation was required. On the 15th of November he\r\nharvested three hundred and seventy bushels of splendid roots to the\r\nacre, carefully measured off.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive equivalent of Swedish turnips as compared with good meadow\r\nhay is 676, taking hay as a standard at 100; that is, it would require\r\n6.76 lbs. of turnips to furnish the same nutriment as one pound of good\r\nhay; but, fed in connection with other food, as hay, for instance,\r\nperhaps five pounds of turnips would be about equal to one pound of hay.\r\n\r\nThe English or round turnip is usually sown broadcast after some other\r\ncrop, and large and valuable returns are often obtained. The Swede is\r\nsown in drills. Both these varieties are used for the production of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the turnip crop is that it leaves many kinds of\r\nsoil unfit for a succession of some other crops, like Indian corn, for\r\ninstance. In some sections no amount of manuring appears to make corn do\r\nwell after turnips or ruta bagas.\r\n\r\nThe MANGOLD WURZEL, a variety of the _Beta vulgaris_, is often\r\ncultivated with great success in this country, and fed to cows with\r\nadvantage, furnishing a succulent and nutritive food in winter and\r\nspring. The crop is somewhat uncertain. When it does well an enormous\r\nyield is often obtained; but it often proves a failure, and is not, on\r\nthe whole, quite as reliable as the ruta baga, though a more valuable\r\ncrop when the yield is good. It is cultivated like the common beet, in\r\nmoist, rich soils, three pounds of seed to the acre. The leaves may be\r\nstripped off, towards fall, and fed out, without injury to the growth of\r\nthe root. Both mangolds and turnips should be cut with a root-cutter,\r\nbefore being fed out.\r\n\r\nThe PARSNIP (_Pastinaca sativa_) is a very sweet and nutritive article\r\nof fodder, and adds richness and flavor to the milk. It is worthy of\r\nextended culture in all parts of this country where dairy husbandry is\r\npursued. It is a biennial, easily raised on deep, rich, well-cultivated\r\nand well-manured soils, often yielding enormous crops, and possessing\r\nthe advantage of withstanding the severest winters. As an article of\r\nspring feeding, therefore, it is exceedingly valuable. Sown in April or\r\nMay, it attains a large growth before winter. Then, if desirable, a part\r\nof the crop may be harvested for winter use, and the remainder left in\r\nthe ground till the frost is out, in March or April, when they can be\r\ndug as wanted, and are exceedingly relished by milch cows, and stock of\r\nall kinds. They make an admirable feed at the time of milking, and\r\nproduce the richest cream, and the yellowest and finest-flavored butter,\r\nof any root with which I am acquainted. The good dairy farmers on the\r\nisland of Jersey often feed to their cows from thirty to thirty-five\r\npounds of parsnips a day, in addition to hay or grass.\r\n\r\nBoth practical experiment and scientific analysis prove this root to be\r\neminently adapted to dairy stock, where the richness of milk or\r\nfine-flavored butter is any object. For mere milk-dairies, it is not\r\nquite so valuable, probably, as the Swedish turnip. The culture is\r\nsimilar to that of carrots, a rich, mellow, and deep loam being best;\r\nwhile it has a great advantage over the carrot in being more hardy, and\r\nrather less liable to injury from insects, and more nutritive. For\r\nfeeding and fattening stock it is eminently adapted.\r\n\r\nTo be sure of a crop, fresh seed must be had, as it cannot be depended\r\non more than one year. For this reason, the largest and straightest\r\nroots should be allowed to stand for seed, which, as soon as nearly\r\nripe, should be taken off and spread out to dry, and carefully kept for\r\nuse. For field culture the hollow-crowned parsnip is the best and most\r\nprofitable; but on thin, shallow soils the turnip-rooted variety should\r\nbe used. Parsnips may be harvested like carrots, by ploughing along the\r\nrows. Let butter or cheese dairymen give this crop a fair and full\r\ntrial, and watch its effect on the quality of the milk and butter.\r\n\r\nThe KOHL RABI (_Brassica oleracea_, var. _caulorapa_) is also cultivated\r\nto a considerable extent in this country, to feed to stock. It is\r\nsupposed to be a hybrid between the cabbage and the turnip, and is often\r\ncalled the cabbage-turnip, having the root of the former, with a\r\nturnip-like or bulbous stem. The special reason for its more extensive\r\ncultivation among us is its wonderful indifference to droughts, in which\r\nit seems to flourish best, and to bring forth the most luxuriant crops.\r\nIt also withstands the frosts remarkably, being a hardy plant. It yields\r\na somewhat richer quality of milk than the ordinary turnip, and the crop\r\nis generally admitted to be as abundant and profitable. I have seen\r\nvery large crops of it produced by the ordinary turnip or cabbage\r\ncultivation. As in cabbage culture, it is best to sow the seed in March\r\nor April, in a warm and well-enriched seed-bed; from which it is\r\ntransplanted in May, and set out after the manner of cabbages in garden\r\nculture. It bears transplanting better than most other roots. Insects\r\ninjure it less than the turnip, dry weather favors it, and it keeps well\r\nthrough the winter. For these reasons, it must be regarded as a valuable\r\naddition to our list of forage plants adapted to dairy farming. It grows\r\nwell on stronger soils than the turnip.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINSEED MEAL is the ground cake of flax-seed, after the oil is pressed\r\nout. It is very rich in fat-forming principles, and given to milch cows\r\nit increases the quality of butter, and keeps them in condition. Four or\r\nfive pounds a day are sufficient for cows in milk, and this amount will\r\neffect a great saving in the cost of other food, and at the same time\r\nmake a very rich milk. It is extensively manufactured in this country,\r\nand largely exported, but is worthy of more general use here. It must\r\nnot be fed in too large quantities to milch cows, for it would be liable\r\nto give too great a tendency to fat, and thus affect the quantity of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPE-CAKE possesses much the same qualities. It is the residuum after\r\npressing the oil from rape-seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON-SEED MEAL is an article of comparatively recent introduction. It\r\nis obtained by pressing the seed of the cotton-plant, which extracts the\r\noil, when the cake is crushed or ground into meal, which has been found\r\nto be a very valuable article for feeding stock. An analysis has been\r\ngiven on a preceding page, which shows it to be equal or superior to\r\nlinseed meal. Practical experiments are needed to establish it. It is\r\nprepared chiefly in Providence, R. I., and is for sale in the market at\r\na very reasonable price.\r\n\r\nThe MANURES used in this country in the culture of the plants mentioned\r\nabove are mostly such as are made on the farm, consisting chiefly of\r\nbarn-yard composts of various kinds, with often a large admixture of\r\npeat-mud. There are few farms that do not contain substances which, if\r\nproperly husbanded, would add very greatly to the amount of manure\r\nordinarily made. The best of the concentrated manures, which it is\r\nsometimes necessary to use, for want of time and labor to prepare enough\r\non the farm, is, unquestionably, Peruvian guano. The results of this,\r\nwhen properly applied, are well known and reliable, which can hardly be\r\nsaid of any other artificial manure offered for the farmer’s notice. The\r\nchief objection to depending on manures made off the farm is, in the\r\nfirst place, their great expense; and in the second, which is equally\r\nimportant, the fact that, though they may be made valuable, and produce\r\nat one time the best results, a want of care in the manufacture, or\r\ndesigned fraud, may make them almost worthless, with the impossibility\r\nof detecting the imposition, without a chemical analysis, till it\r\nbecomes too late, and the crop is lost.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, safest to rely mainly upon the home manufacture of\r\nmanure. The extra expense of soiling cattle, saving and applying the\r\nliquid manure, and thus bringing the land to a higher state of\r\ncultivation, when it will be capable of keeping more stock, and of\r\nfurnishing more manure, would offer a surer road to success than a\r\nconstant outlay for concentrated fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe various articles used for top-dressing grass lands, and the\r\nmanagement of grass and pasture lands, have been treated of in detail in\r\nthe work already alluded to, on the CULTURE OF GRASSES AND FORAGE\r\nPLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk, as the first and natural food of man, has been used from the\r\nremotest antiquity of the human race. It is produced by the females of\r\nthat class of animals known as the _mammalia_, and was designed by\r\nnature as the nourishment of their young; but the richest and most\r\nabundant secretions in common use are those of the cow, the camel, the\r\nmare, and the goat. The use of camel’s milk is confined chiefly to\r\nAfrica and to China, that of mares to Tartary and Siberia, and that of\r\ngoats to Italy and Spain. The milk of the cow is universally esteemed.\r\n\r\nMilk is an opaque fluid, generally white in color, having a sweet and\r\nagreeable taste, and is composed of a fatty substance, which forms\r\nbutter, a caseous substance, which forms cheese, and a watery residuum,\r\nknown as serum, or whey, in cheese-making. The fatty or butyraceous\r\nmatter in pure milk varies usually from two and a half to six and a half\r\nper cent.; the caseous or cheesy matter, from three to ten per cent.;\r\nand the serous matter, or whey, from eighty to ninety per cent.\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye milk appears to be of the same character and\r\nconsistence throughout; but under the microscope a myriad of little\r\nglobules of varied forms, but mostly round or ovoid, and of very unequal\r\nsizes, appear to float in the watery matter. On more minute\r\nexamination, these butter-globules are seen to be enclosed in a thin\r\nfilm of caseous matter. They are so minute that they filter through the\r\nfinest paper. Milk readily assimilates with water and other sweet and\r\nunfermented liquids, though it weighs four per cent. more than water.\r\nCold condenses, heat liquefies it.\r\n\r\nThe elements of which it is composed, not being similar in character or\r\nspecific gravity, undergo rapid changes when at rest. The oily\r\nparticles, being lighter than the rest, soon begin to separate from\r\nthem, and rise to the surface in the form of a yellowish semi-liquid\r\ncream, while the greater specific gravity of the serous matter, or whey,\r\ncarries it to the bottom.\r\n\r\nA high temperature very soon develops acidity, and hastens the\r\nseparation of the cheesy matter, or curd, from the whey. And so the\r\nthree principal elements are easily distinguished.\r\n\r\nBut the oily or butyraceous matter, in rising to the surface, brings up\r\nalong with it many cheesy particles, which mechanically adhere to it,\r\nand give it more or less of a white instead of a yellow color; and many\r\nwatery or serous particles, which make it thinner, or more liquid, than\r\nit otherwise would be. If it rose up free from the adhesion of the other\r\nelements, it would appear in the form of pure butter, and would not need\r\nto undergo the process of churning to separate it from other substances.\r\nThe time may come when some means will be devised, either mechanical or\r\nchemical, to separate the butter particles from the rest instantaneously\r\nand completely, and thus avoid the often long and tedious process of\r\nchurning.\r\n\r\nThe coagulation, or collecting together of the cheesy particles, by\r\nwhich the curd becomes separated from the whey, sometimes takes place so\r\nrapidly, from the effect of great heat, or sudden changes in the\r\natmosphere, that there is not time for the butter particles to rise to\r\nthe surface, and they remain mixed up with the curd.\r\n\r\nNor does the serous or watery matter remain distinct or free from the\r\nmixture of particles of the cheesy and buttery matters. It also holds in\r\nsuspension some alkaline salts and sugar of milk, to the extent of from\r\nthree to four per cent. of its weight.\r\n\r\nWe have, then,\r\n\r\n                       {Butter.     }\r\n        {Cream.        {Butter-milk.} Water.\r\n  Milk. {                     {Buttery and cheesy residuum.}\r\n        {Skimmed milk. {Curd. {Sugar of milk.              } Pure\r\n                       {Whey. {Salts.                      } water.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated, in other words, that milk is composed chiefly of\r\ncaseine, or curd, which gives it its strength, and from which cheese is\r\nmade; a butyraceous or oily substance, which gives it its richness; a\r\nsugar of milk, to which it owes its sweetness, and a watery substance,\r\nwhich makes it refreshing as a beverage; together with traces of\r\nalkaline salts, from whence are derived its flavor and medicinal\r\nproperties; and that these constituents appear in proportions which vary\r\nin different specimens, according to the breed of the animal, the food,\r\nthe length of time after parturition, etc.\r\n\r\nMilk becomes sour, on standing exposed to a warm atmosphere, by the\r\nchange of its sugar of milk into an acid known as lactic acid; and it is\r\nowing to this sugar, and the chemical changes to which it gives rise,\r\nthat milk is susceptible of undergoing all degrees of fermentation, and\r\nof being made into a fermented and palatable but intoxicating liquor,\r\nwhich, by distillation, produces pure alcohol. This liquor is\r\nextensively used in some countries. The arrack of the Arabs is\r\nsometimes made from camel’s milk.\r\n\r\nThe Tartars make most of their spirituous liquors from milk; and for\r\nthis purpose they prefer mare’s milk, on account of its larger\r\npercentage of sugar, which causes a greater and more active\r\nfermentation. The liquor made from it is termed milk-wine, or khoumese.\r\nIt resembles beer, and has intoxicating qualities. The process of\r\nmanufacture is very simple. The milk, being allowed first to turn sour,\r\nis then heated to the proper temperature, when it begins to ferment; and\r\nin a day in summer, or two or three days in winter, the process is\r\ncompleted, and the liquor may be kept several weeks without losing its\r\ngood qualities.\r\n\r\nThe admirable though complicated organization of the udder and teats of\r\nthe cow has already been explained, in speaking of the manner of\r\nmilking. But it may be said, in general, that the number of stomachs or\r\npowerful digestive organs of the ruminants is wonderfully adapted to\r\npromote the largest secretions of every kind.\r\n\r\nThe udder of the cow, the more immediate and important receptacle of\r\nmilk, and in which other milk-vessels terminate, is divided into two\r\nsections, and each of these sections is subdivided into two others,\r\nmaking four divisions, each constituting in itself, to some extent, an\r\norgan of secretion. But it is well known that, as a general thing, the\r\nlateral section, comprising the two hind teats, usually secretes larger\r\nquantities of milk than the front section, and that its development,\r\nboth external and internal, is usually the greatest.\r\n\r\nMilk is exceedingly sensitive to numerous influences, many of which are\r\nnot well understood. It is probably true that the milk of each of the\r\ndivisions of the udder differs to some extent from that of the others in\r\nthe same animal; and it is well known that the milk of different cows,\r\nfed on the same food, has marked differences in quality and composition.\r\nBut food, no doubt, has a more powerful and immediate effect than\r\nanything else, as we should naturally suppose from the fact that it goes\r\ndirectly to supply all the secretions of the body. Feeding exclusively\r\non dry food, for instance, produces a thicker, more buttery and cheesy\r\nmilk, though less abundant in quantity, than feeding on moist and\r\nsucculent food. The former will be more nutritive than the latter.\r\n\r\nCows in winter will usually give a milk much richer in butter and less\r\ncheesy than in summer, for the same reason; while in summer their milk\r\nis richer in cheese and less buttery than in winter. As already\r\nintimated, the frequency of milking has its effect on the quality.\r\nMilking but once a day would give a more condensed and buttery milk than\r\nmilking twice or three times. The separation of the different\r\nconstituents of milk begins, undoubtedly, before it leaves the udder;\r\nand hence we find that the milk first drawn from the cow at a milking is\r\nfar more watery than that drawn later, the last drawn, commonly called\r\nthe strippings, being the richest of all, and containing from six to\r\ntwelve times as much butter as the first.\r\n\r\nMany other influences affect the milk of cows, both in quantity and\r\nquality, as the length of time after calving, the age and health of the\r\ncow, the season of the year, etc. Milk is whiter in color in winter than\r\nin summer, even when the feeding is precisely the same. At certain\r\nseasons the milk of the same cow is bluer than at others. This is often\r\nobservable in dog-days.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of milk is greater than that of water, that of the\r\nlatter being one thousand, and that of the former one thousand and\r\nthirty-one on an average, though it varies greatly as it comes from\r\ndifferent cows, and even at different times from the same cow. A feeding\r\nof salt given to the cow will, in a few hours, cause the specific\r\ngravity of her milk to vary from one to three per cent.\r\n\r\nMilk will ordinarily produce from ten to fifteen per cent. of its own\r\nvolume in cream; or, on an average, not far from twelve and a half per\r\ncent. Eight quarts of milk will, therefore, make about one quart of\r\ncream. But the milk of cows that are fed so as to produce the richest\r\nmilk and butter will often very far exceed this, sometimes giving over\r\ntwenty per cent. of cream, and in very rare instances twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six per cent. The product of milk in cream is more regular than\r\nthe product of cream in butter. A very rich milk is lighter than milk of\r\na poor quality, for the reason that cream is lighter than skim-milk.\r\n\r\nOf the different constituents of milk, caseine is that which most\r\nresembles animal matter, and hence the intrinsic value of cheese as a\r\nnutritive article of food. Hence, also, the nutritive qualities of\r\nskimmed milk, or milk from which the cream only has been removed, while\r\nthe milk is still sweet. The oily or fatty parts of milk furnish heat to\r\nthe animal system; but this is easily supplied by other substances.\r\n\r\nFrom the peculiar nature of milk, and its extreme sensitiveness to\r\nexternal influences, the importance of the utmost care in its management\r\nmust be apparent; and this care must begin from the moment when it\r\nleaves the udder, especially if it is to be made into butter. In this\r\ncase it would be better, if it were convenient, to keep the different\r\nkinds of milk of the same milking by itself--that which comes first from\r\nthe udder, and that which is drawn last; and if the first third could be\r\nset by itself, and the second and the third parts by themselves, the\r\ntime required to raise the cream of each part would doubtless be\r\nconsiderably less than it is where the different elements of the milk\r\nare so intimately mixed together in the process of milking, after being\r\nonce partially separated, as they are before they leave the udder.\r\n\r\nAfter milking, as little time as possible should elapse before the milk\r\nis brought to rest in the pan. The remarks of Dr. Anderson on the\r\ntreatment of milk are pertinent in this connection. “If milk,” says he,\r\n“be put into a dish and allowed to stand until it throws up cream, the\r\nportion of cream rising first to the surface is richer in quality and\r\nequal in quantity to that which rises in a second equal space of time;\r\nand the cream which rises in a second interval of time is greater in\r\nquantity and richer in quality than that which rises in a third equal\r\nspace of time. That of the third is greater than that of the fourth, and\r\nso of the rest; the cream that rises continuing progressively to\r\ndecrease in quantity and quality, so long as any rises to the surface.\r\n\r\n“Thick milk always throws up a much smaller proportion of the cream\r\nwhich it actually contains than milk that is thinner, but the cream is\r\nof a richer quality; and if water be added to that thick milk, it will\r\nafford a considerably greater quantity of cream, and consequently more\r\nbutter, than it would have done if allowed to remain pure; but its\r\nquality at the same time is greatly deteriorated.\r\n\r\n“Milk which is put into a bucket or other proper vessel, and carried in\r\nit to a considerable distance, so as to be much agitated and in part\r\ncooled before it be put into the milk-pans to settle for cream, never\r\nthrows up so much or so rich a cream as if the same milk had been put\r\ninto the milk-pans, without agitation, directly after it was milked.”\r\n\r\nMilk as it comes from the cow is about blood-heat, or 98° Fah. It should\r\nbe cooled off as little as possible before coming to rest. With this\r\nobject in view, the pails may be rinsed with hot water before milking,\r\nand the distance from the place of milking to the milk-room should be as\r\nshort as possible; but, even with all these precautions, the fall in\r\ntemperature will be considerable.\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said with regard to the manner in which the\r\ncream or oily particles of the milk rise to the surface, and the\r\ndifficulty of rising through a great space, on account of their intimate\r\nentanglement with the cheesy and other matters, the importance of using\r\nshallow pans must be sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate and hasten the rising of the butter or oily particles, the\r\nimportance of keeping the milk-room at a uniform and pretty high\r\ntemperature will be equally obvious. The greatest density of milk is at\r\nor near the temperature of 41° Fah.; and at this point the butter\r\nparticles will, of course, rise with the greatest difficulty and\r\nslowness, and bring up a far greater amount of cheese particles than\r\nunder more favorable circumstances. These caseous and watery matters, as\r\nhas been already stated, cause the cream or the butter to look white,\r\nand to ferment and become rancid. To avoid this, the temperature is\r\ngenerally kept, in the best butter-dairies, as high as from 58° to 62°.\r\nSome recommend keeping the milk at over 70°, and from that to 80°, at\r\nwhich temperature the cream, they say, rises very rapidly, especially if\r\nthe depth through which it has to rise is but slight. But that, in the\r\nopinion of most practical dairymen, is too high.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the greatest amount of cream from a given quantity of milk,\r\nthe depth in the pan should, it seems to me, never exceed two inches. A\r\nhigh temperature and shallow depth, as they liquefy the milk and\r\nfacilitate the rising of the particles, tend to secure a cream free\r\nfrom the cheesy matter, and such cream will make a quality of butter\r\nboth more delicate to the taste, and less likely to become rancid, than\r\nany other.\r\n\r\nIt has already been intimated, in another connection, that neither the\r\nlargest quantity nor the best quality of milk is given by the cow till\r\nafter she has had two or three calves, or has arrived at the age of five\r\nor six years. It may also be said, what cannot fail to have attracted\r\nthe attention of observing dairymen, that in very dry seasons the\r\nquantity of milk yielded will generally be less, though the quality will\r\nbe richer, than in moist and mild seasons.\r\n\r\nHence it may be inferred that moist climates are much more favorable to\r\nthe production of milk than dry ones; and this also has been frequently\r\nobserved and admitted to be a well-known fact. From these facts it may\r\nbe stated that dry and warm weather increases the quantity of butter,\r\nbut it is also true that cooler weather produces a greater amount of\r\ncheese. A state of pregnancy, it is obvious, must reduce the quality of\r\nthe milk, and cause it to yield less cream than before.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of milk the utmost cleanliness is especially requisite.\r\nThe pails, the strainers, the pans, the milk-room, and, in short,\r\neverything connected with the dairy, must be kept neat and clean to an\r\nextent which few but the very best dairy-women can appreciate. The\r\nsmallest portion of old milk left to sour in the strainers or pans will\r\nbe sure to taint them, and impart their bad flavor to the new milk put\r\ninto them. Every one is familiar with the fact that an exceedingly small\r\nquantity of yeast causes an active fermentation. The process is a\r\nchemical one, and another familiar instance of it is in the distillation\r\nof liquors and the brewing of beer, where the malt creates a very active\r\nfermentation. In a similar manner the smallest particle of sour milk\r\nwill taint a large quantity of sweet.\r\n\r\nThe milk-room should be removed from dampness, and all gases which might\r\nbe injurious to the milk by infecting the atmosphere. If the state of\r\nthe atmosphere and the temperature, as has been stated, affect it, all\r\ncontact with foreign substances to which it is liable in careless and\r\nslovenly milking, and all air rendered impure by vegetables and\r\ninnumerable other things kept in a house-cellar, will be much more\r\nliable to taint and injure it. Milk appears to absorb odors from objects\r\nnear it, to such an extent that a piece of catnip lying near the pan has\r\nbeen known to impart its flavor to it.\r\n\r\nMilk, as sold in most large cities, is often adulterated to a great\r\nextent, but most frequently with water. Not unfrequently, too, a part of\r\nthe cream is first taken off, and water afterwards added; in which case\r\nthe use of burnt sugar is very common for coloring the milk, the\r\nblueness of which would otherwise lead to detection. The adulteration of\r\npure milk from the healthy cow by water, though dishonest, and\r\nobjectionable in the highest degree, is far less iniquitous in its\r\nconsequences than the nefarious traffic in “swill-milk,” or milk\r\nproduced from cows fed entirely on “still-slops,” from which they soon\r\nbecome diseased, after which the milk contains a subtle poison, which is\r\nas difficult of detection by any known process of chemistry as the\r\nmiasma of an atmosphere tainted with yellow fever or the cholera. The\r\nsimple fact is sufficiently palpable, that no pure and healthy milk can\r\nbe produced by an unhealthy and diseased animal; and that no animal can\r\nlong remain healthy that is fed on an unnatural food, and treated in the\r\nmanner too common around the distilleries of many large cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the well-known influence which “still-slops” and\r\nother exceedingly succulent food have in increasing the amount of water\r\nin the milk, that adulteration may be effected by means of the food, as\r\nwell as by addition of water to the milk itself. It is evident, too, on\r\na moment’s reflection, that the specific gravity of pure milk must vary\r\nexceedingly, as it comes from different cows, or from the same cow at\r\ndifferent times. This variation reached to the extent of twenty-three\r\ndegrees in the milk of forty-two different cows, or from one thousand\r\nand eight to one thousand and thirty-one; but so great a variation is\r\nvery rare, and not to be expected.\r\n\r\nNo reliable conclusion, as to whether a particular specimen of milk has\r\nbeen adulterated or not, can therefore be drawn from the differences in\r\nspecific gravity alone. A radical difficulty attending this test arises\r\nfrom the fact that the specific gravity both of water and cream is less\r\nthan that of pure milk. If, therefore, the hydrometer sinks deeper into\r\nthe fluid than would be expected in ordinary pure milk, how is it\r\npossible, unless the variation is very large, to tell whether it is due\r\nto the richness of the milk in cream, or to the water? I have, for\r\ninstance, two instruments, each labelled “Lactometer,” but both of which\r\nare simple hydrometers (Fig. 71), or specific gravity testers, one of\r\nwhich is graduated with the water-mark 0 and that of pure milk 20°; the\r\nwater-mark of the other being 0, like the first, and that of pure milk\r\n100°. Both are the same in principle, the only difference being in the\r\ngraduation. On the former, graduated for pure milk at 20°, it is\r\ndifficult to tell with accuracy the small variations in the percentage\r\nof water or cream, the divisions on the scale are so minute, while the\r\nlatter marks them so that they can be read off with greater ease and\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing the difference in the specific gravity in\r\ndifferent specimens of pure milk, taken from the cows in the morning,\r\nand allowed to cool down to about 60°, I used the latter instrument with\r\nthe following results: The first pint drawn from a native cow stood at\r\n101°, the scale being graduated at 100° for pure milk. The last pint of\r\nthe same milking, being the strippings of the same cow, stood at 86°.\r\nThe mixture of the two pints stood at about 93¹⁄₂°. The milk of a\r\npure-bred Jersey stood at 95°, that of an Ayrshire at 100°, that of a\r\nHereford at 106°, that of a Devon at 111°, while a thin cream stood at\r\n66°. All these specimens of milk were pure, and milked at the same time\r\nin the morning, carefully labelled in separate vessels, and set upon the\r\nsame shelf to cool off; and yet the variations of specific gravity\r\namounted to 25°, or, taking the average quality of the native cows’ milk\r\nat 93¹⁄₂°, the variations amounted to 17¹⁄₂°.\r\n\r\nBut, knowing the specific gravity, at the outset, of any specimen of\r\nmilk, the hydrometer would show the amount of water added. This cheap\r\nand simple instrument is therefore of frequent service.\r\n\r\nThe lactometer is a very different instrument, and measures the\r\ncomparative richness of different specimens of milk. It is of very great\r\nservice both in the butter and cheese dairy, for testing the comparative\r\nvalue of different cows for the purposes for which they are kept. This\r\ninstrument is very simple and cheap and the practical dairyman can tell\r\nby it what cows he can best part with without detriment to his\r\nbusiness. No cow should be admitted to a herd kept for butter-making\r\nwithout knowing her qualities in this respect.\r\n\r\nMany would find, on examination, that some of their cows, though giving\r\na good quantity, were comparatively worthless to them. Such was the\r\nexperience of John Holbert, of Chemung, New York, who, in his statement\r\nto the state agricultural society, says: “I find, by churning the milk\r\nof each cow separately, that one of my best cows will make as much\r\nbutter as three of my poorest, _giving the same quantity_ of milk. I\r\nhave kept a dairy for twenty years, but I never until the past season\r\nknew that there was so much difference in cows.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Lactometer.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of the lactometer is a series of graduated glass tubes\r\n(Fig. 72), or vials, of equal diameter; generally a third of an inch\r\ninside, and about eleven inches long. The tubes are filled to an equal\r\nheight, each one with the milk of a different cow, and allowed to stand\r\nfor the cream to rise. The difference in thickness of the column of\r\ncream will be very perceptible, and it will be greater than most people\r\nimagine. The effect of different kinds of food for the production of\r\nbutter may be studied in the same way. This form of the lactometer was\r\ninvented by Sir Joseph Banks.\r\n\r\nVarious means are used for the preservation of milk. One of these is by\r\nconcentrating it by boiling. Where this is followed, as it is by some\r\ndairymen, as a regular business, the milk is poured, as it comes from\r\nthe dairy, into long, shallow, copper pans, and heated to a temperature\r\nof a hundred and ten degrees, Fahrenheit. A little sugar is then mixed\r\nin, and the whole body of milk is kept in motion by stirring for some\r\nthree or four hours. The water is evaporated, leaving the milk about one\r\nfourth of its original bulk. It is now put into tin cans, the covers of\r\nwhich are soldered on, when the cans are lowered into boiling water.\r\nAfter remaining a while, they are taken out and hermetically sealed, in\r\nwhich condition the milk will keep for months. Concentrated milk may\r\nthus be taken to sea or elsewhere. Another form is that of solidified\r\nmilk, in which state it is easily and perfectly soluble in water; and\r\nwhen so dissolved with a proper proportion of water, it assumes its\r\noriginal form of milk, and may be made into butter. A statement by Dr.\r\nDorémus, in the New York _Medical Journal_, explains the process, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“To one hundred and twelve pounds of milk twenty eight pounds of\r\nStuart’s white sugar were added, and a trivial portion of bicarbonate of\r\nsoda,--a teaspoonful,--merely enough to insure the neutralizing of any\r\nacidity, which, in the summer season, is exhibited even a few minutes\r\nafter milking, although inappreciable to the organs of taste. The sweet\r\nmilk was poured into evaporating pans of enamelled iron, imbedded in\r\nwarm water heated by steam. A thermometer was immersed in each of these\r\nwater-baths, that, by frequent inspection, the temperature might not\r\nrise above the point which years of experience have shown advisable. To\r\nfacilitate the evaporation, by means of blowers and other ingenious\r\napparatus a current of air is established between the covers of the pans\r\nand the solidifying milk. Connected with the steam-engine is an\r\narrangement of stirrers, for agitating the milk slightly, while\r\nevaporating, and so gently as not to _churn_ it. In about three hours\r\nthe milk and sugar assumed a pasty consistency, and delighted the\r\npalates of all present. By constant manipulation and warming, it was\r\nreduced to a rich, creamy-looking powder, then exposed to the air to\r\ncool, weighed into parcels of a pound each, and by a press, with the\r\nforce of a ton or two, made to assume the compact form of a tablet (the\r\nsize of a small brick), in which shape, covered with tin-foil, it is\r\npresented to the public.\r\n\r\n“Some of the solidified milk which had been grated and dissolved in\r\nwater the previous evening was found covered with a rich cream; this,\r\nskimmed off, was soon converted into excellent butter. Another solution\r\nwas speedily converted into wine-whey by a treatment precisely similar\r\nto that employed in using ordinary milk. It fully equalled the\r\nexpectations of all; so that solidified milk will hereafter rank among\r\nthe necessary appendages to the sick room. In fine, this article makes\r\npaps, custards, puddings, and cakes, equal to the best milk; and one may\r\nbe sure it is an unadulterated article, obtained from well-pastured\r\ncattle, and not the produce of distillery slops; neither can it be\r\n_watered_. For our steamships, our packets, for those travelling by land\r\nor by sea, for hotel purposes, or use in private families, for young or\r\nold, we recommend it cordially as a substitute for fresh milk.”\r\n\r\nA pound of this solidified milk, it is said, will make five pints when\r\ndissolved in water.\r\n\r\nAnother favorite form in which milk is used is that known as ice-cream,\r\na cheap and healthy luxury during the summer months. It is frozen in a\r\nsimple machine made for the purpose, in the best form of which the time\r\nof the operation is from six to ten minutes. The richest quality of\r\nice-cream is made from cream, in the following manner: To one quart of\r\ncream use the yolks of three eggs. Put the cream over the fire till it\r\nboils, during which time the eggs are beaten up with half a pound of\r\nwhite sugar, powdered fine; and when the cream boils stir it upon the\r\neggs and sugar, then let it stand till quite cold, then add the juice of\r\nthree or four lemons. It is then ready to put into the freezer. The heat\r\nof the cream partially cooks the eggs, and the stirring must be\r\ncontinued to prevent their cooking too much.\r\n\r\nA somewhat simpler receipt, given by the confectioners, is the\r\nfollowing: To half a pound of powdered sugar add the juice of three\r\nlemons. Mix the sugar and lemon together, and then add one quart of\r\ncream. This is less rich and delicate than the preceding, but is quite\r\nrich enough for common use, and some trouble is saved.\r\n\r\nThe following receipt makes a very good ice-cream.\r\n\r\nTwo quarts of good _rich_ milk; four fresh eggs; three quarters of a\r\npound of white sugar; six teaspoons of Bermuda arrow-root. Rub the\r\narrow-root smooth in a little cold milk, beat the eggs and sugar\r\ntogether, bring the milk to the boiling point, then stir in the\r\narrow-root; remove it then from the fire, and immediately add the eggs\r\nand sugar, stirring briskly, to keep the eggs from cooking, then set\r\naside to cool. If flavored with extracts, let it be done _just before_\r\nputting it in the freezer. If the vanilla bean is used, it must be\r\nboiled in the milk. The preparation must be _thoroughly cooled_ before\r\nthe freezing is proceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe ice-cream by this receipt may be produced at a cost not exceeding\r\ntwenty-five cents a quart, calling the milk five cents a quart, and the\r\neggs a cent apiece, and including the cost of labor. It is quite equal\r\nto that commonly furnished by the confectioners at seventy-five cents a\r\nquart. The arrow-root may be dispensed with. The freezer is a cheap and\r\nsimple machine.\r\n\r\nAfter the cream has frozen in the machine, it should stand an hour or\r\ntwo to harden before it is used.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo secure a more uniform flow and a richer quality of milk, cows are\r\nsometimes spayed, or castrated. The milk of spayed cows is pretty\r\nuniform in quantity, and this quantity will be, on an average, a little\r\nmore than before the operation was performed. But few instances have\r\ncome under my observation, and those few have resulted satisfactorily,\r\nthe quality of the milk having been greatly improved, the yield becoming\r\nregular for some years, and varying only by the difference in the\r\nsucculence of the food. The proper time for spaying is about five or six\r\nweeks after calving, or at the time when the largest quantity of milk is\r\ngiven. There seem to be some advantages in spaying for milk and butter\r\ndairies, where the raising of stock is not attended to. The cows are\r\nmore quiet, never being liable to returns of seasons of heat, which\r\nalways more or less affect the milk both in quantity and quality. They\r\ngive milk nearly uniform in these respects, for several years, provided\r\nthe food is uniformly succulent and nutritious. Their milk is influenced\r\nlike that of other cows, though to less extent, by the quality and\r\nquantity of food; so that in winter, unless the animal is properly\r\nattended to, the yield will decrease somewhat, but will rise again as\r\ngood feed returns. This uniformity for the milk-dairy is of immense\r\nadvantage. Besides, the cow, when old, and inclined to dry up, takes on\r\nfat with greater rapidity, and produces a juicy and tender beef,\r\nsuperior, at the same age, to that of the ox. The operation of spaying\r\nis simple, and may be performed by any veterinary surgeon, without much\r\nrisk of injury.\r\n\r\nThe milk of the cow has often been analyzed. It was found by Haidlen to\r\nconsist of\r\n\r\n  Water,                 873.\r\n  Butter,                 30.\r\n  Caseine,                48.2\r\n  Sugar of milk,          43.9\r\n  Phosphate of lime,       2.31\r\n  Magnesia,                 .42\r\n  Iron,                     .47\r\n  Chloride of Potassium,   1.44\r\n  Sodium and Soda,          .66\r\n                        -------\r\n                        1000.\r\n\r\nBut its composition, as already intimated, varies exceedingly with the\r\nfood of the animal, and is influenced by an infinite variety of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSkim-milk is much more watery than whole milk. It was found by one\r\nanalysis to contain about 97 per cent. of water and 3 per cent. of\r\ncaseine.\r\n\r\nSwill-milk, or milk from cows fed on “still-slops,” in New York, was\r\nfound by analysis to contain less than 1.5 per cent. of butter, some\r\nspecimens having even less than one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe colostrum, or milk of the cow just after calving, contains a large\r\nproportion of cheesy matter. Its amount of caseine was found by careful\r\nanalysis to be 15.1 per cent., of butter 2.6, mucous matter 2, and water\r\n80.3, there being only a trace of sugar of milk.\r\n\r\nThe measures for milk in common use in this country are those used for\r\nwine and beer. The wine quart is about one fifth less than the beer\r\nquart, and is that most commonly used in England. It is to be regretted\r\nthat no uniform standard has been adopted throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBUTTER AND THE BUTTER-DAIRY.\r\n\r\n    “Slow rolls the churn--its load of clogging cream\r\n    At once foregoes its quality and name.\r\n    From knotty particles first floating wide,\r\n    Congealing butter’s dashed from side to side.”\r\n\r\n\r\nButter, as we have seen, is the oily or fatty constituent of all good\r\nmilk, mechanically united or held in suspension by the solution of\r\ncaseine or cheesy matter in water. It is already formed in the udder of\r\nthe cow, and the operations required after it leaves the udder, to\r\nproduce it, effect merely the separation, more or less complete, of the\r\nbutter from the cheese and the whey.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it is natural to suppose that butter was known at\r\nan early date. The wandering tribes, accustomed to take on their\r\njourneys a supply of milk in skins, would find it formed by the\r\nagitation of travelling, and thus would be suggested the first rude and\r\nsimple process of churning.\r\n\r\nBut it is not probable that the Jews possessed a knowledge of it; and it\r\nis pretty well settled, at the present time, that the passages in our\r\nEnglish version of the Old Testament in which it is used are erroneously\r\ntranslated, and that wherever the word butter occurs the word milk, or\r\nsour, thick milk, or cream, should be substituted. And so in Isaiah,\r\n“Milk and honey shall he eat,” instead of “butter;” and in Job (29: 6),\r\n“When I washed my feet in milk,” instead of “butter.” And the\r\nexpression in Prov. (30: 33), “Surely the churning of milk bringeth\r\nforth butter,” would be better translated, according to the best\r\ncritics, “the pressing of the milker bringeth forth milk,” or the\r\n“pressing of milk bringeth forth cheese.”\r\n\r\nIn the oldest Greek writers milk and cheese are spoken of, but there is\r\nno evidence that butter was known to them. The Greeks obtained their\r\nknowledge of it from the Scythians or the Thracians, and the Romans\r\nobtained theirs from the Germans.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Christ it was used chiefly as an ointment in the baths,\r\nand as a medicine. In warm latitudes, as in the southern part of Europe,\r\neven at the present day, its use is comparatively limited, the delicious\r\noil of the olive supplying its place.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that all good milk of the cow contained butter\r\nenclosed in little round globules held in suspension, or floating in the\r\nother substances. As soon as the milk comes to rest after leaving the\r\nudder, these round particles, being lighter than the mass of cheesy and\r\nwatery materials by which they are surrounded, begin to rise and work\r\ntheir way to the surface. The largest globules, being comparatively the\r\nlightest, rise first, and form the first layer of cream, which is the\r\nbest, since it is less filled with caseine. The next smaller, rising a\r\nlittle slower, are more entangled with other substances, and bring more\r\nof them to the surface; and the smallest rise the slowest and the last,\r\nand come up loaded with foreign substances, and produce an inferior\r\nquality of cream and butter. The most delicate cream, as well as the\r\nsweetest and most fragrant butter, is that obtained by a first skimming,\r\nonly a few hours after the milk is set. Of three skimmings, at six,\r\ntwelve, and eighteen hours after the milk is strained into the pan, that\r\nfirst obtained will make more and richer butter than the second, and\r\nthat next obtained richer than the third, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe last quart of milk drawn at a milking, for reasons already stated,\r\nwill make a more delicious and savory butter than the first; and if the\r\nlast quart or two of a milking is set by itself, and the first cream\r\nthat rises taken from it after standing only five or six hours, it will\r\nproduce the richest and highest-flavored butter the cow is capable of\r\ngiving, under like circumstances as to season and feed.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the butter particles from the others is slower and\r\nmore difficult in proportion to the thickness and richness of the milk.\r\nHence in winter, on dry feeding, the milk being richer and more buttery,\r\nthe cream or particles of butter are slower and longer in rising. But,\r\nas heat liquefies milk, the difficulty is overcome in part by elevating\r\nthe temperature. The same effect is produced by mixing a little water\r\ninto the milk when it is set. It aids the separation, and consequently\r\nmore cream will rise in the same space of time, from the same amount of\r\nrich milk, with a little water in it, than without. Water slightly warm,\r\nif in cold weather, will produce the most perceptible effect. The\r\nquantity of butter will be greater from milk treated in this way; the\r\nquality, slightly deteriorated.\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent, from what has been said, that butter may be\r\nproduced by agitating the whole body of the milk, and thus breaking up\r\nthe filmy coatings of the globules, as well as by letting it stand for\r\nthe cream to rise. This course is preferred by many practical dairymen,\r\nand is the general practice in some of the countries most celebrated for\r\nsuperior butter.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment of milk and the management of cream have been\r\nalready alluded to in a former chapter. It has been seen that the first\r\nrequisites to successful dairy husbandry are good cows, and abundant\r\nand good feeding, adapted to the special object of the dairy, whether it\r\nbe milk, butter, or cheese; and that, with both these conditions, an\r\nabsolute cleanliness in every process, from the milking of the cow to\r\nbringing the butter upon the table, is indispensably necessary.\r\n\r\nCleanliness may, indeed, with propriety be regarded as the chief\r\nrequisite in the manufacture of good butter; for the least suspicion of\r\na want of it turns the appetite at once, while both milk and cream are\r\nso exceedingly sensitive to the slightest taint in the air, in\r\neverything with which they come in contact, as to impart the\r\nunmistakable evidence of any negligence, in the taste and flavor of the\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say, therefore, that good butter depends more upon the\r\nmanufacture than upon any other one thing, and perhaps than all others\r\nput together. So important is this point, that a judicious writer\r\nremarks that “in every district where good butter is made it is\r\nuniversally attributed to the richness of the pastures, though it is a\r\nwell-known fact that, take a skilful dairymaid from that district into\r\nanother, where good butter is not usually made, and where, of course,\r\nthe pastures are deemed very unfavorable, she will make butter as good\r\nas she used to do. And bring one from this last district into the other,\r\nand she will find that she cannot make better butter there than she did\r\nbefore, unless she takes lessons from the servants, or others whom she\r\nfinds there;” and a French writer very justly observes that “the\r\nparticular nature of Bretagne butter, whose color, flavor, and\r\nconsistence, are so much prized, depends neither on the pasture nor on\r\nthe particular species of cow, but on the mode of making;” and this will\r\nhold, to a considerable extent, in every country where butter is made.\r\n\r\nMany things, indeed, concur to produce the best results, and it would be\r\nuseless to underrate the importance of any; but, with the best of cows\r\nto impart the proper color and consistency to butter, the sweetest feed\r\nand the purest water to secure a delicate flavor, the utmost care must\r\nstill be bestowed by the dairymaid upon every process of manufacture, or\r\nelse the best of milk and cream will be spoiled, or produce an article\r\nwhich will bring only a low price in the market, when, with greater\r\nskill, it might have obtained the highest.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the care requisite to preserve the milk from\r\ntaint, it may be inferred that attention to the milk and dairy room is\r\nof no small importance. In very large butter-dairies, a building is\r\ndevoted exclusively to this department. This should be at a short\r\ndistance from the yard, or place of milking, but no further than is\r\nnecessary to be removed from all impurities in the air arising from it,\r\nand from all low, damp places, subject to disagreeable exhalations. This\r\nis of the utmost importance. It should be well ventilated, and kept\r\nconstantly clean and sweet, by the use of pure water; and especially, if\r\nmilk is spilled, it should be washed up immediately, with fresh water.\r\nNo matter if it is but a single drop; if allowed to soak into the floor\r\nand sour, it cannot easily be removed, and it is sufficient to taint the\r\nair and the milk in the room, though it may not be perceptible to the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nIn smaller dairies, economy dictates the use of a room in the house; and\r\nthis, in warm climates, should be on the north side, and used\r\nexclusively for this purpose. I have known many to use a room in the\r\ncellar as a milk-room; but very few cellars are at all suitable. Most\r\nare filled with a great variety of articles which never fail to infect\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nBut, if a house-cellar is so built as to make it a suitable place to\r\nset the milk, as where a large dry and airy room, sufficiently isolated\r\nfrom the rest, can be used, a greater uniformity of temperature can\r\nusually be secured than on the floor above. The room, in this case,\r\nshould have a gravel or loamy bottom, uncemented, but dry and porous.\r\nThe soil is a powerful absorbent of the noxious gases which are apt to\r\ninfect the atmosphere near the bottom of the cellar.\r\n\r\nMilk should never be set on the bottom of a cellar, if the object is to\r\nraise the cream. The cream will rise in time, but rarely or never so\r\nquickly or so completely as on shelves from five to eight feet from the\r\nbottom, around which a free circulation of pure air can be had from the\r\nlatticed windows. It is, perhaps, safe to say that as great an amount of\r\nbetter cream will rise from the same milk in twelve hours on suitable\r\nshelves, six feet from the bottom, as would be obtained directly on the\r\nbottom of the same cellar in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Milk-stand.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most convenient forms for shelves in a dairy-room designed\r\nfor butter-making is represented in Fig. 73, made of light and seasoned\r\nwood, in an octagonal form, and capable of holding one hundred and\r\nseventy-six pans of the ordinary form and size. It is so simple and\r\neasily constructed, and so economizes space, that it may readily be\r\nadapted to other and smaller rooms for a similar purpose. If the\r\ndairy-house is near a spring of pure and running water, a small stream\r\ncan be led in by one channel and taken out by another, and thus keep a\r\nconstant circulation under the milk-stand, which may be so constructed\r\nas to turn easily on the central post, so as often to save many\r\nfootsteps.\r\n\r\nThe pans designed for milk are generally made of tin. That is found,\r\nafter long experience, to be, on the whole, the best and most\r\neconomical, and subject to fewer objections than most other materials.\r\nGlazed earthen ware is often used, the chief objection to it being its\r\nliability to break, and its weight. It is easily kept clean, however,\r\nand is next in value to tin, if not, indeed, equal to it. A tin skimmer\r\nis commonly used, somewhat in the form of the bowl of a spoon, and\r\npierced with holes, to remove the cream. In some sections of the\r\ncountry, a large white clam-shell is very commonly used instead of a\r\nskimmer made for the purpose, the chief objection to it being that the\r\ncream is not quite so carefully separated from the milk.\r\n\r\nA mode of avoiding the necessity of skimming has long been used to some\r\nextent in England, by which the milk is drawn off through a hole in the\r\nbottom of the pan. This plan is recommended by Unwerth, a German\r\nagriculturist, who proposes a pan represented in Fig. 74, made of block\r\ntin, oblong in shape, and having the inside corners carefully rounded.\r\nThe pan is only two inches in depth, and is made large enough to hold\r\nsix or eight quarts of milk at the depth of one and a half inches. This\r\nshallowness greatly facilitates the rapid separation of the cream,\r\nespecially at a temperature somewhat elevated. A strainer is shown in\r\nFig. 75, pierced with holes, the centre half an inch lower than the rim,\r\nto which hooks are fixed to hold it to the top of the pan. On this a\r\ncoarse linen cloth is laid, the milk being strained through both the\r\ncloth and the strainer, thus serving to separate all foreign substances\r\nin a thorough manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Milk-pan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of the milk-pan, near one end, is an opening, _a_, through\r\nwhich the milk is drawn, after the cream is all risen or separated from\r\nit, by raising a brass pin, _b_. The opening is lined with brass, and is\r\nthree fourths of an inch in diameter. Fig. 76 represents the tin\r\ncylinder magnified. This is pierced, to the height of an inch, with many\r\nsmall holes, diminishing in size towards the top. The cream is all risen\r\nin twenty-four hours. The pin is then drawn from the cylinder, and the\r\nmilk flows out, leaving the thick cream, which is prevented from flowing\r\nout by the smallness of the holes in the cylinder.\r\n\r\nWith the form of pans in most common use in this country, which are\r\ncircular, three or four inches deep, this shallow depth of milk causes a\r\nlittle more trouble in skimming; but, if the principle is correct, the\r\nform and depth of the pan will be easily adapted to it.\r\n\r\nAfter the cream is removed, it is put into stone or earthen jars, and\r\nkept in a cool place till a sufficient quantity is accumulated to make\r\nit convenient to churn. If a sufficient number of cows is kept, it is\r\nfar better to churn every day; but in ordinary circumstances that may be\r\noftener than is practicable. The more frequently the better; and the\r\nadvantages of frequent churning are so great that cream should never be\r\nkept longer than three or four days, where it is possible to churn so\r\noften.\r\n\r\nThe mode of churning in one of the many good dairies in\r\nPennsylvania,--that of Mr. J. Comfort, of Montgomery county,--is as\r\nfollows: He uses a large barrel-shaped churn, of the size of about two\r\nhogsheads, hung on journals supported by a framework in an adjoining\r\nbuilding. It is worked by machinery in a rotatory motion, by a horse\r\ntravelling around in a circle. The churning commences about four o’clock\r\nin the morning in summer, the cream being poured into the churn and the\r\nhorse started. When the butter has come, a part of the butter-milk is\r\nremoved by a vent-hole in the churn. Then, without beating the mass\r\ntogether, as is usual, a portion of the butter and its butter-milk is\r\ntaken out by the spatula and placed in the bottom of a tub covered with\r\nfine salt, and spread out equally to a proper depth; then the surface of\r\nthis butter is covered with salt, and another portion of butter and\r\nbutter-milk taken from the churn and spread over the salted surface in\r\nthe same manner, and salted as before, thus making a succession of\r\nlayers, till the tub is full. The whole is then covered with a white\r\ncloth, and allowed to stand a while. A part of this butter, say eight or\r\nten pounds, is then taken from the tub and laid on a marble table (Fig.\r\n80), grooved around the edges, and slightly inclined, with a place in\r\nthe groove for the buttermilk and whey to escape. It is then worked by a\r\nbutter-worker or brake, turning on a swivel-joint, which perfectly and\r\ncompletely removes the butter-milk, and flattens out the butter into a\r\nthin mass; then the surface is wiped by a cloth laid over it, and the\r\nworking and wiping repeated till the cloth adheres to the butter, which\r\nindicates that the butter is dry enough, when it is separated into pound\r\nlumps, weighed and stamped, ready for market. The rest of the butter in\r\nthe tub is treated in the same way.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this method avoids the ordinary washing with water,\r\nnot a drop of water being used, from beginning to the end. It avoids\r\nalso the working by hand, which in warm weather has a tendency to soften\r\nthe butter. In the space of about an hour a hundred pounds are thus\r\nmade, and its beautiful color and fragrance preserved. If it happens to\r\ncome from the churn soft, it hardens by standing a little longer in the\r\nbrine.\r\n\r\nThe most common form of the churn in small dairies is the upright or\r\ndash-churn, Fig. 77; but many other forms are in extensive use, each\r\npossessing, doubtless, more or less merit peculiar to itself. The\r\ncylinder churn, Fig. 78, is very simply constructed, and capable of\r\nbeing easily cleaned. Some prefer the thermometer churn, Fig. 79, having\r\nan attachment for indicating the temperature of the cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there are two modes of practice with regard to the\r\nprocess of churning, each of which has its advantages. The milk itself\r\nmay be churned, or it may be set in the milk-room for the cream to rise,\r\nwhich is to be churned by itself. The former is the practice of a\r\nsuccessful dairyman of New York, who, in his statement, says: “I take\r\ncare to have my cellar thoroughly cleansed and whitewashed early every\r\nspring. I keep milk in one cellar, and butter in another. Too much care\r\ncannot be taken by dairymen to observe the time of churning. I usually\r\nchurn from one hour to one hour and a half, putting from one to two\r\npails of cold water in each churn. When the butter has come, I take it\r\nout, wash it through one water, set it in the cellar and salt it, then\r\nwork it from three to five times before packing. Butter should not be\r\nmade quite salt enough until the last working. Then add a little salt,\r\nwhich makes a brine that keeps the butter sweet. One ounce of salt to a\r\npound of butter is about the quantity I use. I pack the first day, if\r\nthe weather is cool; if warm, the second. If the milk is too warm when\r\nchurned, the quantity of butter will be less, and the quality and flavor\r\nnot so good as when it is at a a proper temperature, which, for churning\r\nmilk, is from 60° to 65°.”\r\n\r\nBut, whichever course it is thought best to adopt, whether the milk or\r\ncream is churned, it is the concussion, rather than the motion, which\r\nserves to bring the butter. This may be produced in the simple square\r\nbox as well as by the dasher churn; and it is the opinion of a\r\nscientific gentleman with whom I have conversed on the subject, that the\r\nperfect square is the best form of the churn ever invented. The cream or\r\nmilk in this churn has a peculiar compound motion, and the concussion on\r\nthe corners and right-angled sides is very great, and causes the butter\r\nto come as rapidly as it is judicious to have it. This churn consists of\r\na simple square box, which any one who can handle a saw and plane can\r\nmake, hung on axles turned by a crank somewhat like the barrel churn. No\r\ndasher is required. If any one is inclined to doubt the superiority of\r\nthis form over all others, he can easily try it and satisfy himself. It\r\ncosts but little.\r\n\r\nIn some sections the milk is churned soon after milking; in others, the\r\nnight’s and morning’s milk are mixed together, and churned at noon; in\r\nothers, the cream is allowed to rise, when the milk is curdled, and\r\ncream, curd, and whey, are all churned together.\r\n\r\nA successful instance of churning only the cream is found in the\r\nstatement of Mr. Lincoln, who received the first dairy premium of the\r\nMassachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture. He says: “The\r\ncream, as it is skimmed, is poured into stone pots, which in warm\r\nweather are kept in a refrigerator, and during the winter stand in the\r\nmilk-room. The times of churning depend upon the quantity of cream.\r\n\r\n“The time usually occupied in churning is from fifty minutes upwards.\r\nThis is deemed a matter of importance. We consider it much better to\r\nbring the cream to the degree of temperature necessary to the formation\r\nof butter by a steady, moderate agitation, than to use artificial heat\r\nto take it to that point before commencing to churn. By such moderate,\r\nlong-continued agitations, we think the butter has a firmer, more waxy\r\nconsistence than it can have by more rapid churning. The churn used is\r\n‘Galt’s.’ Numerous trials have been made with many of the other kinds of\r\nchurns in comparison with this, and the result has been uniformly\r\nfavorable to this patent.\r\n\r\n“When the butter has _come_, the butter-milk is drawn off, and the\r\nbutter, after being thoroughly worked, is salted with from one half to\r\nthree fourths ounces of salt to the pound. It is now set away for\r\ntwenty-four hours, when it is again worked over thoroughly, and made\r\ninto pound lumps with wooden ‘spatters.’ After standing another\r\ntwenty-four hours, it is sent into market. In ‘working’ butter we use a\r\ntable over which a fluted roller is made to pass (Fig. 80), rolling out\r\nthe butter into a thin sheet, and completely and entirely depriving it\r\nof butter-milk.\r\n\r\n“From many years’ experience, the observation is warranted, that by no\r\nother process of manufacture can the butter-milk be so completely\r\nextracted. I am aware of the truth of the objection made that the\r\nshrinkage occasioned by its use is too great; yet there is, in fact, a\r\ndifference in the worth of the butter made upon it, over that\r\nmanufactured in the ordinary way, quite equal to the loss in weight\r\noccasioned by it.”\r\n\r\nThe high reputation of Philadelphia butter being so well known, I was\r\ndesirous of ascertaining the opinions of practical men as to what this\r\nwas due,--whether to any peculiar richness of the pasturage, or to the\r\ncareful mode of manufacture. In reply to my inquiries, I have received\r\nsatisfactory statements from several sources, and among them the\r\nfollowing communication from one of the most successful of the\r\nbutter-makers who supply that market. “The high reputation of\r\nPhiladelphia butter,” he says, “is owing to the manner of its\r\nmanufacture, though I would not say that the sweet-scented vernal and\r\nother natural grasses do not add to the fine quality of well-made\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n“In proof of what I say, I would refer to the experience of my brother,\r\nwho is the owner of two farms. His tenant, an excellent butter-maker,\r\nlived on one farm, and made a very fine article, which brought the\r\nhighest prices. He moved to the other farm, where the former tenant had\r\nnever made good butter, and had ascribed his want of success to the\r\nspring-house. On this farm he succeeded in establishing a higher\r\nreputation than he ever had before. The tenant who followed him on the\r\nfirst farm never succeeded in gaining a reputation for good butter, his\r\ninability arising from his ignorance of the proper mode of manufacture,\r\nand his unwillingness to improve by the experience of others.\r\n\r\n“Only a part of the information as to the best mode of manufacture can\r\nbe given, so much depends on the _judgment_ and experience of the\r\noperator. The first thing required is to provide a suitable place. This\r\nshould be, for the summer months, a well-ventilated house, over a good\r\nspring of water. The second requisite will be proper vessels to hold the\r\nmilk and cream, and for churning. A table is needed which shall not be\r\nused for any other purpose than for working and printing the butter on.\r\nI have always used a lever in connection with the table (Fig. 80). A\r\nlarge sponge, with a linen cloth to cover it, with which the milk can be\r\nremoved from the butter, is another important article; and then a\r\nskimmer, either of wood or tin, or both, as may be necessary in the\r\ndifferent states of the milk; a thermometer, and a boiler convenient for\r\nheating water for cleansing the vessels. No person can expect to make\r\ngood butter without the greatest attention to the cleanliness of the\r\nvessels used for the milk and cream, and care in exposing them to the\r\nsun and air.\r\n\r\n“After the milk has been brought from the yard or stable, strain it\r\nimmediately into the pans, in which has been put a little sour milk from\r\nwhich the cream has been removed, the quantity varying from a\r\ntablespoonful to half a common teacupful, according to the state of the\r\nweather. In very warm weather the smaller quantity is sufficient. But\r\nthe rule for warm weather will not always hold good; for, from the\r\nelectrical state of the atmosphere, the milk may sour either too slow or\r\ntoo fast.\r\n\r\n“The pans containing the milk should then be set into the water, if the\r\nweather be hot: and here is a point where the operator should exercise\r\nhis or her judgment; for even in warm weather it may be necessary to\r\ndraw off the water from the milk, if the spring be cold. The milk should\r\nremain there, under no circumstances, longer than the fourth meal, or\r\nforty-eight hours; but thirty-six hours is much to be preferred, if the\r\nmilk has become thick, or the cream sufficiently raised, when it should\r\nbe taken off carefully, so as not to take any sour milk with it, and put\r\nin the cream-pot. When the cream-pot is full, sprinkle a small handful\r\nof fine salt over the top of the cream, and let it remain. Our custom\r\nhas been, when making butter but once a week, to pour the cream into a\r\nclean vessel at the end of three days, keeping back any milk that might\r\nhave been taken up with the cream, which is found at the bottom of the\r\njar.\r\n\r\n“I would mention that it is essential, in making a fine article, to keep\r\nthe cream clear of milk. The next operation will he preparatory to\r\nchurning, by straining the cream, and reducing the temperature of the\r\nchurn by the use of the cold spring-water. The operation of churning\r\nshould neither be protracted nor hastened too much. After the butter has\r\nmade its appearance of the size of a small pea, draw off the milk, and\r\nthrow in a small amount of cold water, and gather it. After the butter\r\nhas been taken from the churn, it is placed upon the table, worked over\r\nby the lever, and salted; then worked again with the lever, in\r\nconnection with the sponge and cloth, a pan of cold water being at hand,\r\nwith a piece of ice in it in summer, into which you throw the cloth and\r\nsponge frequently, and wring out dry before again using it. These, as\r\nwell as every other article which will come into contact with the\r\nbutter, must be scalded, and afterward, as well as the hands, placed in\r\ncold water. I would here add that the use of the sponge is one of the\r\nimportant points in making butter to keep well; for by it you can\r\nremove almost every particle of butter-milk, which is the great agent in\r\nthe destruction of its sweetness and solidity. For the winter dairy a\r\nroom in which is placed a stove should be provided, which can be made\r\nwarm, and also well ventilated. I prefer the use of coal, on account of\r\nkeeping the fire through the night. My dairy-room is adjoining the\r\nspring-house, and connects with it, which I consider important. This\r\nroom should be used for no other purpose, as cream and butter are the\r\ngreatest absorbents of effluvia with which I am acquainted. I have known\r\ngood butter to be spoiled by being placed over night in a close closet.\r\n\r\n“The thermometer should always accompany the winter dairy. There is one\r\nthing very important in the winter dairy, which, perhaps, I should have\r\nplaced first, and that is the food of the cows; for, without something\r\nelse than hay, you will not make very fine butter. Mill-feed and\r\ncorn-meal I consider about the best for yield and quality, although\r\nthere are many other articles of food which will be useful, and\r\ncontribute to the appetite and health of the cattle.\r\n\r\n“The process for the winter dairy is similar to that of the summer, with\r\nthe exception of the regulation as to the temperature of room, etc.,\r\nwhich is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Particular care should be taken not to let the milk get cold before\r\nplacing it in the dairy-room; for, should it be completely chilled, the\r\ncream will not rise well. Add about a gill of warm water to the sour\r\nmilk for each pan, before straining into it, which will greatly\r\nfacilitate the rising of the cream. Keep the temperature of the room as\r\nnear fifty-eight degrees, Fahrenheit, as possible, and guard against the\r\nair being dry by having a small vessel of water upon the stove, or else\r\na dry coat will form on the surface of the cream. The cream should be\r\nkept in a colder place than the dairy-room until the night before\r\nchurning, when it might be placed in the warm room, so that its\r\ntemperature shall be about 58°.\r\n\r\n“The churn may be prepared by scalding it, and then reduced to the same\r\ntemperature as the cream by cold water, using the thermometer as a test.\r\n\r\n“This regulation of temperature is of the greatest importance: for,\r\nshould it be too low, you will be a long time churning, and have poor,\r\ntasteless butter; if too high, the butter will be soft and white.”\r\n\r\nWhat is especially noticeable in the above statement is the use of the\r\nsponge, and the thorough and complete removal of all the butter-milk.\r\nHere is probably the secret of success, after all. I have given the\r\nstatement in full, notwithstanding its length, on account of the\r\nwell-known excellence of the butter produced by the process, as well as\r\nfor the suggestions with regard to the dairy-rooms, and not because I\r\ncan recommend all its details for the imitation of others. The use of\r\nsour milk in the pans is based, I suppose, on the idea that the cream\r\ndoes not begin to rise till acidity commences in the milk,--an idea\r\nwhich was once pretty generally entertained; but the process of souring\r\nundoubtedly commences, though imperceptible to the senses, very soon\r\nafter the milk comes to rest in the pan. At any rate, there is no doubt\r\nthat the separation of the butter from the other substances commences at\r\nonce, and without the addition of any foreign substance to the milk.\r\n\r\nNor do I believe there is any necessity for the milk to stand over\r\ntwenty-four hours in any case; for I have no doubt that all the best of\r\nthe cream rises within the first twelve hours, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, and I am inclined to think that whatever is added to the\r\nquantity of cream after twenty-four hours, detracts from the quality of\r\nthe butter to an extent which more than counterbalances the whole of the\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nMany good dairy-women make an exceedingly fine article, in spite of the\r\ndefects of some parts of the process of manufacture. This does not show\r\nthat they would not make still better butter if they remedied these\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nThe more we can retard the development of acidity in the milk, within\r\ncertain limits, the more cream may we expect to get; and hence some use\r\nartificial means for this purpose, mixing in the milk a little\r\ncrystallized soda, dissolved in twice its volume of water, which\r\ncorrects the acidity as soon as it forms. It is a perfectly harmless\r\naddition, and increases the product of the butter, and improves its\r\nquality. But under ordinarily favorable circumstances, from twelve to\r\neighteen hours will be sufficient to raise all the cream in summer, and\r\nfrom twenty to thirty hours in winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Butter-worker.]\r\n\r\nThe butter-worker, Fig. 80, with its marble top, used by the writer of\r\nthe statement above, is an important addition to the implements of the\r\ndairy. It effects the complete removal of the butter-milk, without the\r\nnecessity of bringing the hands in contact with it. Another form of the\r\nlever butter-worker is seen in Fig. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nTo keep the cream properly after it is placed away in pots or jars, it\r\nshould stand in a cool place, and whenever additions of fresh cream are\r\nmade, they should be stirred in. Many keep the cream, as well as the\r\nbutter, in the well, in hot weather. This is the practice of Mr.\r\nHorsfall, whose experiments have been alluded to. Finding his butter\r\ninclined to be soft, he lowered a thermometer twenty-eight feet into the\r\nwell, and found it indicated 43°, the temperature of the surface being\r\n70°. He then let down the butter, and found it somewhat improved; and\r\nsoon after began to lower down the cream, by means of a movable windlass\r\nand a rope, the cream-jar being placed in a basket hung on the rope. The\r\ncream was let down on the evening previous to churning, and drawn up in\r\nthe morning and immediately churned. The time of churning the cream at\r\nthis temperature would be as long as in winter, and the butter was found\r\nto have the same consistency.\r\n\r\nThe same object is effected in this country by the use of ice in many\r\nsections; but, if the butter remains too long on ice, or in an\r\nice-house, it is apt to become bleached, and lose its natural and\r\ndelicate straw-color.\r\n\r\nThe time of churning is by no means an unimportant matter. Various\r\ncontrivances have been made to shorten this operation; but the opinions\r\nof the best and most successful dairymen concur that it cannot be too\r\nmuch hastened without injuring the fine quality and consistency of the\r\nbutter. The time required depends much on the temperature of the cream;\r\nand this can be regulated at convenience, as indicated above.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the dairy-room should be as uniform as possible. The\r\npractice of the best and most successful dairymen differs in respect to\r\nthe degree to which it should be kept; but the range is from 52° to 62°\r\nFahr., and I am inclined to think from 58° to 60° the best. At 60°, with\r\na current of fresh, pure air passing over it, the cream will rise very\r\nrapidly and abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe greatest density of milk is at about 41°, and cream rises with great\r\ndifficulty and slowness as the temperature falls below 50° towards that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nA practical butter dealer of New York gives the following as the best\r\nmode of packing butter, or putting it up for a distant market. The\r\ngreatest care, he says, should be taken to free the butter entirely from\r\nmilk, by working it and washing it after churning at a temperature so\r\nlow as to prevent it from losing its granular character and becoming\r\ngreasy. The character of the product depends in a great measure on the\r\ntemperature of churning and working, which should be between sixty and\r\nseventy degrees Fahr. If free from milk, eight ounces of Ashton salt is\r\nsufficient for ten pounds. Western salt should never be used, as it\r\ninjures the flavor. While packing, the contents of the firkin should be\r\nkept from the air by being covered with saturated brine. No undissolved\r\nsalt should be put in the bottom of the firkin.\r\n\r\nGoshen butter is reputed best, though much is put up in imitation of it,\r\nand sold at the same price. Great care should be taken to have the\r\nfirkins neat and clean. They should be of white oak, with hickory hoops,\r\nand should hold about eighty pounds. Wood excludes air better than\r\nstone, and consequently keeps butter better. Tubs are better than pots.\r\n\r\nWestern butter comes in coarse, ugly packages; even flour and pork\r\nbarrels are sometimes used. Much of it must be worked over and re-packed\r\nhere before it will sell. It generally contains a good deal of milk, and\r\nif not re-worked soon becomes rancid. Improper packing, in kegs too\r\nlarge and soiled on the outside, makes at least three cents a pound\r\ndifference. Whatever the size of the firkin, it must be perfectly tight\r\nand quite full of butter, so that when opened the brine, though present,\r\nwill not be found on the top.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of May, dairymen should pack in quarter firkins or\r\ntubs, with white oak covers, and send directly to market as fresh\r\nbutter. From this time until the fall frost there is but little change\r\nin color and flavor with the same dairy, and it may be packed in whole\r\nfirkins, and kept in a cool place. The fall butter should also be packed\r\nseparately in tubs.\r\n\r\nTo prepare new butter-boxes for use in the shortest time, dissolve\r\ncommon, or bicarbonate of soda in boiling water, as much as the water\r\nwill dissolve, and water enough to fill the boxes; about a pound of soda\r\nwill be required to be put into a thirty-two pound box, and the water\r\nshould be poured upon it. Let it stand over night, and the box may be\r\nsafely used next day. This mode is cheap and expeditious, and, if\r\nadopted, would often save great losses. Potash has a like effect.\r\n\r\nAs already seen, in the statements of practical dairymen, the greatest\r\ncare is required in the salting or seasoning. Over-salted butter is not\r\nonly less palatable to the taste, but less healthy than fresh, sweet\r\nbutter. The same degree of care is needed with respect to the box in\r\nwhich it is packed. I have often seen the best and richest-flavored\r\nbutter spoilt by sending it to the exhibition or to market in new and\r\nimproper boxes. A new pine-wood box should always be avoided.\r\n\r\nButter that has been thoroughly worked, and perfectly freed from\r\nbutter-milk, is of a firm and waxy consistence, so as scarcely to dim\r\nthe polish of the blade of a knife thrust into it, leaving upon it only\r\na slight dew as it is withdrawn. If it is soft in texture, and leaves\r\ngreasy streaks of butter-milk upon the knife that cuts it, or upon the\r\ncut surface after the blade is withdrawn, it shows an imperfect and\r\ndefective process of manufacture, and is of poor quality, and will be\r\nliable to become rancid.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly delicate and fine-flavored butter may be made by wrapping\r\nthe cream in a napkin or clean cloth, and burying it, a foot deep or\r\nmore, in the earth, from twelve to twenty hours. This experiment I have\r\nrepeatedly tried with complete success, and have never tasted butter\r\nsuperior to that produced by this method. It requires to be salted to\r\nthe taste as much as butter made by any other process. A tenacious\r\nsubsoil loam would seem to be best. After putting the cream into a clean\r\ncloth, the whole should be surrounded by a coarse towel. The butter thus\r\nproduced is white instead of yellow or straw-color.\r\n\r\nButter has been analyzed by Prof. Way, with the following result:\r\n\r\n  Pure fat, or oil,          82.70\r\n  Caseine, or curd,           2.45\r\n  Water, with a little salt, 14.85 = 100\r\n\r\nThe fat or oil peculiar to butter is in winter more solid than in\r\nsummer, and known as margarine fat, while that of summer is known as\r\nliquid or oleine fat. The proportions in which these are found in\r\nordinary butter have been stated by Prof. Thomson, as follows:\r\n\r\n                          Summer. Winter.\r\n  Solid or margarine fat,   40      65\r\n  Liquid or oleine fat,     60      35\r\n                           ---     ---\r\n                           100     100\r\n\r\nWinter butter appears to be rich and fine in proportion as the oleine\r\nfat increases. The proportion is undoubtedly dependent on the food.\r\n\r\nA more general attention to the details of butter-making, and to the\r\nbest modes of preserving its good qualities, would add many thousands of\r\ndollars to the aggregate profits of our American dairies.\r\n\r\nIn the management of the dairy, an ice-house and a good quantity of ice\r\nfor summer use are not only very convenient for regulating the\r\ntemperature of the dairy-room, and for keeping butter at the proper\r\nconsistence, and preserving it, but are also profitable in other\r\nrespects. And now, when ice-houses are so easily constructed, and ice is\r\nso readily procured, no well-ordered dairy should be without a liberal\r\nsupply of it. It is housed at a time when other farm-work is not\r\npressing, and ponds are so distributed over the country that it may be\r\ngenerally procured without difficulty; but where ponds or streams are at\r\ntoo great a distance from the dairy-house, an artificial pond can be\r\neasily made, by damming up the outlet of some spring in the\r\nneighborhood. Where this is done, the utmost care should be taken to\r\nkeep the water perfectly clean when the ice is forming. The ice-house\r\nshould be above ground, and in a dry, airy place. The top of a dry knoll\r\nis better than a low, damp shade. The ice may be packed in tan, sawdust,\r\nshavings, or other non-conductors, and when wanted for use it should be\r\ntaken off the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEESE-DAIRY.\r\n\r\n    “Streams of new milk through flowing coolers stray,\r\n    And snow-white curds abound, and wholesome whey.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk, if allowed to become sour, will eventually curdle, when the whey\r\nis easily separated; and this simple mode was probably the universal\r\nmethod of making cheese in ancient times. Cheese, as already explained,\r\nis made from caseine, an ingredient of milk held in solution by means of\r\nan alkali, which it requires the presence of an acid to neutralize.\r\nThis, in modern manufacture, is artificially added to form the curd; but\r\nthe acidity of milk, after standing, acts in the same manner to produce\r\ncoägulation. This is due to the change of the milk-sugar into lactic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nCheese has been made and used as an article of food from a very early\r\ndate. It was well known to the early Jewish patriarchs, and is\r\nfrequently mentioned in the earliest Hebrew records. “Hast thou not\r\npoured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?” says Job; and David\r\nwas sent to “carry ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand in the\r\ncamp.” Most of the ancient nations, indeed, barbarous as well as\r\ncivilized, made it a prominent article of food. But cheese, as made by\r\nthe ancients, was found to be hard and brittle, and not well flavored,\r\nand means were devised to produce the same effect while the milk still\r\nremained sweet. It was observed that acids of various kinds would\r\nanswer, and vinegar was used; and cream of tartar, muriatic acid, and\r\nsour milk, added to sweet, produced a rapid coägulation. In Sweden,\r\nNorway, and other countries, a handful of the plant known as butterwort\r\n(_Pinguicula vulgaris_) is sometimes mixed with the food of the cow, to\r\ncause the milk to coägulate readily. A few hours after milking, the curd\r\nis formed without the addition of an acid. Milk taken into the stomach\r\nof the calf was found to curdle rapidly, even while sweet; and hence the\r\nuse of rennet, which is simply the stomach of the calf, prepared by\r\nwashing, salting, and drying, for preservation. This acts the most\r\nsurely, and, if properly prepared and preserved, is the least\r\nobjectionable, of any article now known; and is, in fact, the natural\r\nmode of curdling the milk as it enters the stomach, preparatory to the\r\nprocess of digestion. Besides this, it is generally the cheapest and\r\nmost available for the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe richness of cheese depends very much upon the amount of butter or\r\noily matter it contains. It may be made entirely of cream, or from whole\r\nor unskimmed milk, to which the cream of other milk is added, or from\r\nmilk from which a part of its cream has been taken, or from ordinary\r\nskim-milk, or from milk that has been skimmed three or four times, so as\r\nto remove nearly every particle of cream, or from butter-milk. The acid\r\nused in curdling milk acts upon the caseine alone, and not upon the\r\nbutter particles, which are imbedded in the curd as it hardens, and thus\r\nincrease its richness and flavor without adding to its consistency,\r\nwhich is due to the caseine.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that cheese made entirely of cream cannot have\r\nthe firmness and consistence of ordinary cheese. It is only made for\r\nimmediate use, and cannot be long kept. It is, in fact, little more\r\nthan thick, dried, sweet cream, from which all the milk has been\r\npressed. On the other hand, skim-milk cheese has the opposite fault of\r\nbeing too hard and tough, and destitute of flavor and richness. The best\r\nquality of cheese is made from full milk, or from milk to which some\r\nextra cream is added, as in the English Stilton renowned for its\r\nrichness and flavor. The Gloucester, Cheshire, Cheddar, Dunlop, and the\r\nDutch Gouda, are made of whole milk, as are the best qualities made in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe process of making cheese is both chemical and mechanical. The\r\nheating of the milk at the time of adding the acid or rennet hastens the\r\nchemical action, and facilitates the separation of the whey; at the same\r\ntime great nicety is required, for, if over-heated, the oily particles\r\nwill run off with the whey. On the complete separation of the whey from\r\nthe curd, and the amount of butter particles retained in the latter, the\r\ntaste or flavor and keeping qualities of the cheese depend. If properly\r\nmade, the taste improves by keeping, but the chemical changes effected\r\nby age are not very well understood.\r\n\r\nThe practical process of manufacture most common in the best dairies of\r\nthis country will appear in the following statements of successful\r\ncompetitors at agricultural exhibitions. The first was made, by request,\r\nto the New York State Agricultural Society, and appeared in its\r\ntransactions, by A. L. Fish, of Herkimer county, one of the finest dairy\r\nregions of that state. The value of his statement is enhanced by the\r\nfact that his cows averaged seven hundred pounds of the first quality of\r\ncheese each in 1844, and seven hundred and seventy-five pounds each in\r\n1845. In his mode of manufacture, the evening’s and morning’s milk is\r\ncommonly used to make one cheese. The evening’s is strained into a tub\r\nor pans, and cooled to prevent souring. The proper mode of cooling is to\r\nstrain the milk into the tin tub set in a wooden vat, described in the\r\ndairy-house, and cool by filling the wooden vat with ice-water from the\r\nice-house, or ice in small lumps, and water from the pump. The little\r\ncream that rises over night is taken off in the morning, and kept till\r\nthe morning and evening milk are put together, and the cream is warmed\r\nto receive the rennet. It is mixed with about twice its quantity of new\r\nmilk, and warm water added to raise its temperature to ninety-eight\r\ndegrees: stir it till perfectly limpid, put in rennet enough to curdle\r\nthe milk in forty minutes, and mix it with the mass of milk by thorough\r\nstirring; the milk having been previously raised to eighty-eight or\r\nninety degrees, by passing steam from the steam generator to the water\r\nin the wooden vat. In case no double vat is to be had, the milk may be\r\nsafely heated to the right temperature, by setting a tin pail of hot\r\nwater into the milk in the tubs. It may be cooled in like manner by\r\nfilling the pail with ice-water, or cold spring-water where ice is not\r\nto be had. It is not safe to heat milk in a kettle exposed directly to\r\nthe fire, as a _slight_ scorching will communicate its _taint_ to the\r\nwhole cheese and spoil it. If milk is curdled below eighty-four degrees,\r\nthe cream is more liable to work off with the whey. An extreme of heat\r\nwill have a like effect.\r\n\r\nThe curdling heat is varied with the temperature of the air, or the\r\nliability of the milk to cool after adding rennet. The thermometer is\r\nthe only safe guide in determining the temperature; for, if the dairyman\r\ndepends upon the sensation of the hand, a great liability to error will\r\nrender the operation uncertain. If, for instance, the hands have\r\npreviously been immersed in cold water, the milk will feel warmer than\r\nit really is; if, on the contrary, they have recently been in warm\r\nwater, the milk will feel colder than it really is. To satisfy the\r\nreader how much this circumstance alone will affect the sensation of the\r\nhand, let him immerse one hand in warm water, and at the same time keep\r\nthe other in a vessel of cold water, for a few moments; then pour the\r\nwater in the two dishes together, and immerse both hands in the mixture.\r\nThe hand that was previously in the warm water will feel _cold_, and the\r\nother quite warm, showing that the sense of feeling is not a test of\r\ntemperature worthy of being relied upon. A fine cloth spread over the\r\ntub while the milk is curdling will prevent the surface from being\r\ncooled by circulation of air. _No jarring of the milk_, by walking upon\r\na springy floor, or otherwise, should be allowed while it is curdling,\r\nas it will prevent a _perfect cohesion_ of the particles.\r\n\r\n“When milk is curdled so as to appear like a solid, it is divided into\r\nsmall particles to aid the separation of the whey from the curd. This is\r\noften _too speedily done_ to facilitate the work, but at a sacrifice of\r\n_quality_ and _quantity_.”\r\n\r\nTo effect the fine division of the curd for the easy separation of the\r\nwhey, Mr. Fish uses a wire network, made to fit into the tub, the meshes\r\nof fine wire being about a half-inch square, and the outer rim of coarse\r\nand stronger material. A cheese-knife is also used, about half as long\r\nas the diameter of the tub, and firmly fastened to the lower end of a\r\nlong screw which passes through one end of the blade as it lies\r\nhorizontally, leaving the blade at right angles with the screw, which\r\nhas a coarse thread, and passes through a piece of wood on the top of\r\nthe tub, held firm by notches at the ends laid on the edges of the tub.\r\nBy turning a crank, the knife passes down through the curd in\r\nrevolutions, cutting it into layers of the thickness of the threads of\r\nthe screw.\r\n\r\nThe following is the statement of Mrs. Williams, of Windsor,\r\nMassachusetts, who received the first premium at the Franklin County\r\nFair, in 1857, for exceedingly rich, fine, and delicately-flavored\r\ncheeses of seventy-five pounds each. Her method, which is the result of\r\nher own experience and observation, corresponds almost exactly, as the\r\ncommittee remark, with the English mode of making the famous Cheddar\r\ncheese, which is much the same as the Cheshire. Mrs. Williams says: “My\r\ncheese is made from one day’s milk of twenty-nine cows. I strain the\r\nnight’s milk into a tub, skim it in the morning, and melt the cream in\r\nthe morning’s milk: I warm the night’s milk, so that with the morning’s\r\nmilk, when mixed together, it will be at the temperature of ninety-six\r\ndegrees; then add rennet sufficient to turn it in thirty minutes. Let it\r\nstand about half or three quarters of an hour; then cross it off and let\r\nit stand about thirty minutes, working upon it very carefully with a\r\nskimmer. When the curd begins to settle, dip off the whey, and heat it\r\nup and pour it on again at the temperature of one hundred and two\r\ndegrees. After draining off and cutting up, add a teacup of salt to\r\nfourteen pounds.\r\n\r\n“The process of making sage cheese is the same as the other, except\r\nadding the juice of the sage in a small quantity of milk.”\r\n\r\nAnother successful competitor in the same state says: “We usually make\r\nbut one curd in a day. The night’s milk is strained into pans till\r\nmorning, when the cream that will have risen is taken off, and the milk\r\nwarmed to blood heat, when the cream is again returned to the milk and\r\nthoroughly mixed. This prevents the melting of the cream that would\r\notherwise run off with the whey. The whole is then immediately laded\r\ninto a tub with the morning’s milk, and set for the cheese, with rennet\r\nsufficient to form the curd in about thirty minutes; and here much care\r\nis thought to be necessary in cutting and crossing the curd, and much\r\nmoderation in dipping and draining the whey from it, that the white whey\r\n(so called) may not exude from it.\r\n\r\n“When sufficiently drained, it is taken and cut with a sharp knife to\r\nabout the size and form of dice, when it is salted with about one pound\r\nof fine salt to twenty-five of curd. It is then subjected to a moderate\r\npressure at first, gradually increasing it for two days, in the mean\r\ntime turning it twice a day, and substituting dry cloths. It is then\r\ntaken from the press and dressed all over with hot melted butter, and\r\ncovered with thin cotton cloth, and this saturated with the melted\r\nbutter. It is then placed upon the shelf, and turned and rubbed daily\r\nwith the dressing until ripe for use.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most important processes in the manufacture of good cheese is\r\nthe preparation of the rennet. This is made of the inner lining or\r\nmucous membrane of the stomach of the young sucking calf, sometimes\r\ncalled the bag or maw; and the use of it was undoubtedly suggested,\r\noriginally, by observing the complete and rapid coägulation or curdling\r\nof milk in the stomach of a calf newly killed. “Coägulation is the first\r\nprocess of digestion in the fourth stomach of the calf. There are\r\nnumerous glands scattered in and about the stomach that secrete a fluid\r\nwhich readily and almost immediately accomplishes this coägulation. They\r\nare always full of it; even after the animal is dead they remain filled\r\nwith it; and if the stomach is preserved from putrefaction, this fluid\r\nretains its coägulating quality for a considerable period; therefore\r\ndairy-women usually take care of the maw or stomach of the calf; and\r\npreserve it by salting it, and then, by steeping it, or portions of it,\r\nin warm water, they prepare what they call a rennet. After the maw has\r\nbeen salted a certain time, it may be taken out and dried, and then it\r\nwill retain the same property for an indefinite period. A small piece of\r\nthe maw thus dried is steeped over night in a few teaspoonfuls of warm\r\nwater, and this water will _turn_ the milk of three or four cows.”\r\n\r\nIt is important that rennet enough should be prepared at once for the\r\nwhole season, in order to secure as great a uniformity in strength as\r\npossible. The object should be to produce a prompt, complete, and firm\r\nor compact coägulation of all the cheesy matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Aiton, in his admirable treatise on the Dairy Husbandry of Scotland,\r\ngives the simple method of preparing the rennet in the dairy districts,\r\nas follows: “When the stomach or bag--usually termed the yirning--is\r\ntaken from the calf’s body, its contents are examined, and if any straw\r\nor other food is found among the curdled milk, such impurity is\r\ncarefully removed; but all the curdled milk found in the bag is\r\ncarefully preserved, and no part of the chyle is washed out. A\r\nconsiderable quantity of salt--at least two handfuls--is put into and\r\noutside the bag, which is then rolled up and hung near a fire to dry. It\r\nis always allowed to hang until it is well dried, and is understood to\r\nbe improved by hanging a year or longer before being infused.\r\n\r\n“When rennet is wanted, the yirning with its contents is cut small, and\r\nput into a jar with a handful or two of salt; and a quantity of soft\r\nwater that has been boiled and cooled to sixty-five degrees, or of new\r\nwhey taken off the curd, is poured into it. The quantity of water or\r\nwhey necessary is more or less, according to the quality of the yirning:\r\nif it is that of a new-dropped calf, a Scotch chop pin, or at most\r\nthree English pints, will be enough; but if the calf has been fed four\r\nor five weeks, two quarts or more may be used; the yirning of a calf\r\nfour weeks old yields more rennet than that of one twice that age. When\r\nthe infusion has remained in the jar from one to three days, the liquid\r\nis drawn off and strained, after which it is bottled for use; and if a\r\ndram-glass of any ardent spirit is put into each bottle, the infusion\r\nmay either be used immediately, or kept as long as may be convenient.”\r\n\r\nThe mode of preparing rennet in the dairy districts of this country is\r\nvarious; but that adopted by Mr. Fish, of Herkimer, New York, already\r\nquoted, is simple and easy of application. He says: “Various opinions\r\nexist as to the best mode of saving rennet, and that is generally\r\nadopted which, it is supposed, will curdle the most milk. I have no\r\nobjection to any mode that will preserve its strength and flavor so that\r\nit will be smelled and _tasted_ with good relish _when put into the\r\nmilk_. Any composition not thus kept I deem unfit for use, as the\r\ncoägulator is an essential agent in cheesing the curd, and sure to\r\nimpart its own flavor.\r\n\r\n“The rennet never should be taken from the calf till the excrement shows\r\nthe animal to be in perfect health. It should be emptied of its\r\ncontents, salted, and dried, without any scraping or rinsing, and kept\r\ndry for one year, when it will be fit for use. It should not be allowed\r\nto gather dampness, or its strength will evaporate. To prepare it for\r\nuse, into ten gallons of water, blood warm, put ten rennets; churn or\r\nrub them often for twenty-four hours; then rub and press them to get the\r\nstrength; stretch, salt, and dry them, as before. They will gain\r\nstrength for a second use. Make the liquor as salt as it can be made,\r\nstrain and settle it, separate it from the sediment, if any, and it is\r\nfit for use. Six lemons, two ounces of cloves, two ounces of cinnamon,\r\nand two ounces of common sage, are sometimes added to the liquor, to\r\npreserve its flavor and quicken its action. If kept cool in a stone jar,\r\nit will keep sweet any length of time desired, and a uniform strength is\r\nsecured while it lasts. Stir it before dipping off. To set milk, take of\r\nit enough to curdle milk firm in forty minutes; squeeze or rub through a\r\nrag annatto enough to make the curd a cream color, and stir it in with\r\nthe rennet.” It will be seen that he adopts the practice of removing the\r\ncontents of the stomach. This, it appears to me, is the best calculated\r\nto promote cleanliness and purity, so important in making a\r\ngood-flavored cheese.\r\n\r\nBut in Cheshire, so celebrated for its superior cheese, the contents of\r\nthe stomach are frequently salted by themselves, and after being a short\r\ntime exposed to the air are fit for use; while the well-known and\r\nhighly-esteemed Limburg cheese is mostly made with rennet prepared as in\r\nAyrshire, the curd being left in the stomach, and both dried together.\r\nThe general opinion is that rennet, as usually prepared, is not fit to\r\nuse till nearly a year old.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the plan of making a liquid rennet from new and fresh stomachs,\r\nand keeping it in bottles corked tight till wanted for use, would tend\r\nstill further to secure this end.\r\n\r\nThe use of annatto to color the cheese artificially is somewhat common\r\nin this country, though probably not so much so as in many other\r\ncountries. Annatto, or annotto, is made from the red pulp of the seeds\r\nof an evergreen tree of the same name, found in the West Indies and in\r\nBrazil, by bruising and obtaining a precipitate. A variety is made in\r\nCayenne, which comes into the market in cakes of two or three pounds. It\r\nis bright yellow, rather soft to the touch, but of considerable\r\nsolidity. The quantity used is rarely more than an ounce to one hundred\r\npounds, and the effect is simply to give the high coloring so common to\r\nthe Gloucester and Cheshire cheeses, and to many made in this country.\r\nThis artificial coloring is continued from an idle prejudice, somewhat\r\ntroublesome to the dairyman, expensive to the consumer, and adding\r\nnothing to the taste or flavor of the article. The annatto itself is so\r\nuniversally and so largely adulterated, often by poisonous substances,\r\nsuch as lead and mercury, that the practice of using it by the\r\ncheese-maker, and of requiring the high coloring by the consumer, might\r\nwell be discontinued. The common mode of application is to dissolve it\r\nin hot milk, and add at the time of putting in the rennet, or to put it\r\nupon the outside, in the manner of paint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Cheese-press.]\r\n\r\nThe cheese-presses in most common use are very different in\r\nconstruction, and each possesses, doubtless, some peculiar merits. The\r\nself-acting press, Fig. 82, is the favorite of some. Another form of\r\nthis is seen in Fig. 83.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Self-acting cheese-press.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most extensive and experienced dealers in cheese, in one of\r\nthe largest dairy districts of New York,--Mr. Harry Burrill, of Little\r\nFalls,--has placed in my hands the following simple directions for\r\ncheese-making.\r\n\r\nThe cheese-tub should be so graduated that it may be correctly known\r\nwhat quantity of milk is used. This is requisite, in order that the\r\nproper proportions, both of coloring matter and rennet, may be used. The\r\ntemperature should be ascertained by the thermometer. Experience proves\r\nthat when the dairy has been at seventy degrees the best temperature at\r\nwhich to run the milk will be eighty-four degrees; but, as the\r\ntemperature of the dairy at different times of the year will be found to\r\nvary above or below seventy degrees, the temperature of the milk must be\r\nproportionally regulated by the simple addition of cold water, to lower\r\nit; but, to increase the temperature, heat the milk in the usual manner,\r\nalthough it is absolutely necessary to avoid heating it beyond one\r\nhundred and twenty degrees.\r\n\r\nAfter having brought the milk to the required temperature, and added the\r\ncoloring, for every quarter hundred weight of cheese mix one pint of new\r\nsour whey with the requisite proportion of rennet; and, having arrived\r\nat the formation of a good curd, which will be the invariable result of\r\na strict adhesion to the foregoing rules, let it be carefully cut up\r\nwith three-bladed knives, as fine as possible; then dip off half the\r\nwhey, and heat a portion of it to the temperature of ninety-five\r\ndegrees, and return it to the whey and curds; then, after stirring it\r\nfor five minutes, allow the curd to sink, and as quickly as possible dip\r\noff the whey. Having done this, press the curd by placing on it a board\r\nweighted with from three to five fifty-pound weights, which will\r\ngradually and effectually press the remainder of the whey out.\r\n\r\nWhen the whey is dipped off, put the curd into white twig basket-vats,\r\nmade the shape and size of a turned vat, which would contain the sixth\r\nof a hundred weight (about three inches deep, and two feet in diameter).\r\nIt will be necessary to have boards about one inch thick, and two feet\r\nfour inches in diameter, to go between each of these twig vats, to\r\nprevent the whey running from one vat into the other. When it has been\r\npressed, return it again into the cheese-tub, cut it into small pieces,\r\nput it into the vats again in dry cloths, press it and return it to the\r\ntub again, cutting it into small pieces, and to every hundred weight of\r\ncurd add one and one quarter pounds of salt; grind it twice, and stir it\r\nso that it shall be properly mixed with the salt; then put it into\r\nwell-perforated turned vats, taking care to press it thoroughly whilst\r\nthe vats are filling, to prevent the accumulation of air, to the\r\npresence of which is to be attributed the honeycomb appearance so often\r\nobserved in cheese when cut.\r\n\r\nWhen the cheese is put into the press let the pressure gradually upon\r\nit. After it has been in press one and a half hours, take it out and\r\nexamine it, and, should there be any curd pressed over, cut it round and\r\nput it into the middle of the cheese, carefully breaking it up in the\r\nmiddle. Wash the ends of the cloths out in a bowl of warm water, squeeze\r\nthem, and cover the cheese up, and, if there should be any not\r\nsufficiently full, it will be necessary either to put a follower upon\r\nit, or to put it into a smaller vat; in the evening let them be dry\r\nclothed. The following morning salt them all over and dry cloth them,\r\nand repeat this three successive mornings; after which, put them in\r\nvats, placed one on the other, and allow them to stand, if possible, a\r\nfortnight, occasionally wiping them. The cheese will get matured much\r\nsooner by these means, and the tendency to cracking and bulging be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe way to get a fine coat upon cheese, after the first coat has been\r\nwashed and scraped off, is to put the cheese on shelves, nail thick\r\nsheeting to the ceiling from one of the shelves to the other, and let it\r\ndrop closely to the floor. If put over the floor, cover them over with\r\nthick sheeting, or rugs.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of cheese are almost infinite in number, and are often\r\ndependent on very minute details of practice. The general principles\r\ninvolved are the same in all; but it would be next to impossible to find\r\nany one variety of cheese possessing uniformity throughout, in point of\r\ntexture, consistency, taste, flavor, and keeping qualities; and it is\r\nrare, with the present guess-work in many of the operations of\r\ncheese-making, to find a lot of cheese made in the same dairy, from the\r\nsame cows, on the same pastures and by the same hands, which can be\r\nconsidered a fair sample of what is generally produced. These great\r\ndifferences are due to feeding and treatment of the cows in part, but\r\nespecially to the temperature of the milk at the time of curding, which\r\nis again in part dependent on the quality and strength of the rennet\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nNothing is more susceptible to external influences, as has been remarked\r\nelsewhere, than milk and cream, both of which are liable to taint from\r\nthe food of the cows, from impurities derived from careless milking,\r\nfrom exposure to foul or impure air in the cellar or milk-room, and from\r\nsudden changes in the atmosphere. The most scrupulous cleanliness is,\r\ntherefore, required to produce a first quality of cheese, even under\r\nfavorable circumstances. And when it is considered that it is necessary\r\nto observe minutely the temperature of the milk, and that slight\r\ndifferences at the time of forming the curd may make the difference of\r\nmellowness or toughness in the ripened cheese, and that the proper\r\ntemperature is affected by the time taken to bring the curd, which\r\ndepends on the strength and quality of the rennet, some of which will\r\nact in fifteen or twenty minutes, while the same quantity of others\r\nrequires even two or three hours to produce the same effect, the\r\ninfinite variety in the qualities of cheese will scarcely be a matter of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nA brief statement of the mode of making some of the more important and\r\nwell-known varieties will be sufficient in this connection. The details\r\nof cheese-making in some of the best of the dairies of New England and\r\nNew York correspond in a remarkable degree with the mode of making\r\nCheddar and Cheshire cheese, both celebrated for their richness and\r\npopularity in the market. Of the latter there are made, it is said, over\r\ntwelve thousand tons annually; Cheshire taking the lead in\r\ncheese-making, and keeping about forty thousand cows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESHIRE CHEESE is remarkable for its uniformity, being, in dairies of\r\nthe best repute, made by fixed rules, and usually by the same persons.\r\nIf the number of cows is sufficient to make a cheese from one meal, that\r\namount is used; if not, two meals are united. The cows are milked at six\r\no’clock, morning and evening; are kept on rich pastures, and never\r\ndriven far, great care being taken that nothing shall interfere with the\r\nregularity with which every operation connected with this chief source\r\nof the wealth and prosperity of the Cheshire farmer is conducted. The\r\nmilk is brought in large wooden pails into the milk-house, which it is\r\ngenerally contrived shall have a cool north aspect, and immediately\r\nstrained into pans, and placed upon the floor of the dairy. Each pan is\r\nabout six inches in depth, and usually made of block-tin. This substance\r\nis objected to by some because it is liable, like every other metal,\r\nalthough, perhaps, in a less degree than either zinc or lead, to be\r\nacted upon by the lactic acid, and so produce compounds of a deleterious\r\ncharacter. At six o’clock in the morning the cheese-ladder is put on the\r\ncheese-tub, the whole of the night’s milk is again passed through the\r\nsieve, and the morning’s milk is then poured upon it, and well agitated\r\nto equalize the temperature; in cold weather a pan of hot water is\r\npreviously put into the tub, to increase the temperature of the previous\r\nnight’s meal.\r\n\r\nThe rennet is next applied, care being taken that the heat of the whole\r\nquantity of the milk is about seventy-four degrees; and, almost\r\nsimultaneously with the rennet, the annatto,--about a quarter of an\r\nounce is sufficient for a cheese of sixty-four pounds,--both of which,\r\nin all well-regulated dairies, are strained through a piece of silk or\r\nfine cloth. The rennet is generally made on the previous evening, by a\r\npiece of the dried skin about the size of a crown-piece being immersed\r\nin hot water, and allowed to stand all night. After the rennet and\r\ncoloring matter have been thoroughly mixed with the milk, it is covered\r\nwith the lid of the cheese-tub, and in cold weather with a cloth in\r\naddition, to preserve the temperature of the mass until the curd has\r\nformed. It is then left undisturbed for about an hour, and frequently\r\nlonger, to allow the coägulation of the milk. After that time a\r\ncurd-breaker is passed up and down it for about five minutes, and again\r\nit is allowed to settle for another half-hour. The whey is then taken\r\nout by means of a dish or bowl, the curd being gathered to one side of\r\nthe tub, and gently pressed by the hand, to allow the whey to separate\r\nfrom it more easily. It is then pressed by a weight of about fifty\r\npounds; afterwards the curd is taken out of the tub and put into a\r\nbasket, the inside of which is covered with a coarse square\r\ncheese-cloth. The four ends of the cloth are then folded over the curd,\r\na tin hoop being put around the upper edge of the cheese, and within the\r\nsides of the vat, upon which a board is placed bearing a weight of about\r\none hundred pounds, varying, of course, with the size of the cheese.\r\nThis process is repeated two or three times, the curd being slightly\r\nbroken at each operation. It is next taken out of the basket for salting\r\nor curing, and either broken down small by hand or in a curd-mill. A\r\ncertain quantity of salt is then carefully and intimately mixed with\r\nthe curd, according to the experience, taste, and custom, of the\r\ndairymaid. It is then put into the cheese-vat in a coarse cloth, pressed\r\nlightly at first for an hour; then taken out and turned, and the\r\npressure increased until the proper degree of consistence is attained.\r\nAfterwards it is turned every twelve hours for three or four days,\r\nremaining in the vat until the curd becomes so dry as not to moisten the\r\ncloth. During this time skewers are passed through holes made in the\r\nsides of the vat into the body of the cheese, the more effectually to\r\naid the expression of the whey, the pressure being still continued. When\r\nthey are withdrawn, the whey flows through these miniature tunnels,\r\nwhich are in a few moments obliterated by the superincumbent weight.\r\n\r\nIt is the practice of some dairymaids in this county to take the cheese\r\nto a cool salting-house, leaving it there for a week or ten days,\r\nturning it daily, and rubbing salt on the upper surface. Others immerse\r\nthe cheese in a brine almost sufficiently strong to float it, with\r\noccasional turning; others, again, after taking the cheese from the\r\npress, place it in a furnace at a moderate heat, and keep it closed\r\ntherein for a night; while some run a hot iron over the whole, or over\r\nthe edges. The binder--a cloth of three or four inches in breadth--is\r\nthen passed tightly round the cheese, and secured by pins, when it is\r\nremoved to the cheese-room, and placed on a kind of grass, which in\r\nCheshire is called sniggle, the newest or latest-made cheese being put\r\nin the warmest situation. Here it remains, being turned over three times\r\na week while it is new, and less often as it becomes matured, care being\r\ntaken to keep each one of the cheeses separate from all the others. The\r\nroom selected for a store is always that which can be best protected\r\nfrom the light, and any sudden changes of temperature. The best Cheshire\r\ncheese is seldom ripe for the market under one or two years.\r\n\r\nThe STILTON CHEESE is by far the richest of the English dairies. This\r\noriginated in a small town of that name, in Leicestershire. It possesses\r\n“a peculiar delicacy of flavor, a delicious mellowness, and a great\r\naptness to acquire a species of artificial decay; without which, to the\r\nsomewhat vitiated taste of lovers of Stilton cheese, as now eaten, it is\r\nnot considered of prime account. To be in good order, according to the\r\npresent standard of taste, it must be decayed, blue, and moist.” To suit\r\nthis taste, an artificial mode is adopted, old and decayed cheese being\r\nintroduced into the new, or port wine or ale added by means of tasters,\r\nor caulking-pins are stuck into them, and left till they rust and\r\nproduce an appearance of decay in the cheese.\r\n\r\n“It is commonly made by putting the night’s cream to the milk of the\r\nfollowing morning with the rennet, great care being taken that the milk\r\nand the cream are thoroughly mixed together, and that they both have the\r\nproper temperature. _The rennet should also be very pure and sweet._ As\r\nsoon as the milk is curdled, the whole of it is taken out, put into a\r\nsieve gradually to drain, and moderately pressed. It is then put into a\r\ncase or box, of the form that it is intended to be; for, on account of\r\nits richness, it would separate and fall to pieces were not this\r\nprecaution adopted. Afterwards it is turned every day on dry boards,\r\ncloth-binders being tied around it, which are gradually tightened as\r\noccasion requires. After it is removed from the box or hoop, the cheese\r\nmust be closely bound with cloths and changed daily, until it becomes\r\nsufficiently compact to support itself. When these cloths are taken\r\naway, each cheese has to be rubbed over with a brush once every day. If\r\nthe weather is moist or damp, this is done twice a day during two or\r\nthree months. It is occasionally powdered with flour, and plunged into\r\nhot water. This hardens the outer coat and favors the internal\r\nfermentation, and thus produces what is called the ripening of the\r\ncheese. Sometimes it is made in a net like a cabbage-net, which gives it\r\nthe form of an acorn.”\r\n\r\nThe maturity of Stilton cheeses is sometimes hastened by putting them in\r\na bucket, and covering them over with horse-dung.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOUCESTER CHEESE is likewise quite celebrated for its richness,\r\npiquancy, and delicacy of flavor, and justly commands a high price in\r\nthe market. The management of the milk up to the time of curding is\r\nsimilar to that of Cheshire; a cheese, often being made of one meal,\r\nrequires no additional heat to raise it to a proper temperature. After\r\nthe curd is cut into small squares, the whey is carefully drained off\r\nthrough a hair strainer. The cutting is repeated every thirty minutes\r\ntill the whey is removed, when it is put into vats and covered with dry\r\ncloths, and placed in the press. After remaining a sufficient length of\r\ntime, it is put into a curd-mill and cut or ground into small pieces,\r\nwhen it is again packed in fine canvas cloth, and put in the cheese-vat.\r\nHot water or whey is poured over the cloth, to harden the rind and\r\nprevent its cracking. “The curd is next turned out of the vat into the\r\ncloth, and, the inside of the vat being washed with whey, the inverted\r\ncurd with the cloth is returned to the vat. The cloth is then folded\r\nover, and the vat put into the press for two hours, when it is taken\r\nout, and dry cloths applied during the course of the day. It is then\r\nreplaced in the press until salted, which operation is generally\r\nperformed about twenty-four hours after it is made. In salting the\r\ncheese, it is rubbed with finely-powdered salt, and this is thought to\r\nmake the cheese more smooth and solid than when the salting process is\r\nperformed upon the curd. The cheese is after this returned to the vat,\r\nand put under the press, in which several are placed, the newest at the\r\nbottom and the oldest on the top. The salting is repeated three times,\r\ntwenty-four hours being allowed to intervene between each; and the\r\ncheese is finally taken from the press to the cheese-room in the course\r\nof five days. In the cheese-room it is turned over every day for a\r\nmonth, when it is cleaned of all scurf, and rubbed over with a woollen\r\ncloth dipped in a paint made of Indian red or Spanish brown and small\r\nbeer. As soon as the paint is dry, the cheese is rubbed once a week with\r\na cloth. The quantity of salt employed is about three and a half pounds;\r\nand one pound of annatto is sufficient to color half a ton of cheese.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEDDAR CHEESE is another variety in high repute for its richness, and\r\ncommands a high price in the market. It is made of new milk only, and\r\ncontains more fat than the egg. It is, indeed, too rich for ordinary\r\nconsumption. The milk is set with rennet while yet warm, and allowed to\r\nstand still about two hours. The whey first taken off is heated and\r\npoured back upon the curd, and, after turning off the remainder, that is\r\nalso heated and poured back in the same manner, where it stands about\r\nhalf an hour. The curd is then put into the press, and treated very much\r\nas the Cheshire up to the time of ripeness.\r\n\r\nThe DUNLOP CHEESE, the most celebrated of Scotland, had its origin in\r\nAyrshire, from which it was sent to the Glasgow market, and from which\r\nthe manufacture soon spread to Lanark, Renfrew, and other adjoining\r\ncounties. It is manufactured, according to Aiton, in the following\r\nmanner: When the cows on a farm are not so numerous as to yield milk\r\nsufficient to make a cheese every time they are milked, the milk is\r\nstored about six or eight inches deep in the coolers, and placed in the\r\nmilk-house until as much is collected as will form a cheese of a proper\r\nsize. When the cheese is to be made, the cream is skimmed from the milk\r\nin the coolers, and, without being heated, is, with the milk that is\r\ndrawn from the cows at the time, passed through the sieve into the\r\ncurd-vat. The cold milk from which the cream has been taken is heated so\r\nas to raise the temperature of the whole mass to near blood heat; and\r\nthe whole is coägulated by the means of rennet carefully mixed with the\r\nmilk. The cream is put into the curd-vat, that its oily parts may not be\r\nmelted, and the skimmed milk is heated sufficient to raise the whole to\r\nnear animal heat.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the utmost care is always taken to keep the milk, in\r\nall stages of the operation, free not only from every admixture or\r\nimpurity, but also from being hurt by foul air arising from acidity in\r\nany milky substance, putrid water, the stench of the barn, dunghill, or\r\nany other substance; and likewise to prevent the milk from becoming\r\nsour, which, when it happens, greatly injures the cheese. Great care is\r\ntaken to prevent any of the butyraceous or oily matter in the cream from\r\nbeing melted in any stage of the process. To cool the milk, and to\r\nfacilitate the separation or rising of the cream, a small quantity of\r\nclean cold water is generally mixed with the milk in each cooler. The\r\ncoägulum is formed in from ten to fifteen minutes, and nobody would use\r\nrennet twice that required more than twenty minutes or half an hour to\r\nform a curd. Whenever the milk is completely coägulated the curd is\r\nbroken, in order to let the serum or whey be separated and taken off.\r\nSome break the curd slightly at first, by making cross-scores with a\r\nknife or a thin piece of wood, at about one or two inches distant, and\r\nintersecting each other at right angles; and these are renewed still\r\nmore closely after some of the whey has been discharged. Others break\r\nthe whole curd more minutely at once with the hand or the skimmer.\r\n\r\nAfter the curd has been broken, the whey ought to be taken off as\r\nspeedily as it can be done, and with as little further breaking or\r\nhandling the curd as possible. It is necessary, however, to turn the\r\ncurd, cut it with a knife, or break it gently with the hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the curd has consolidated a little, it is cut with the\r\ncheese-knife, slightly at first, and more minutely as it hardens, so as\r\nto bring off the whey. When the greater part of the whey has been\r\nextracted, the curd is taken up from the curd-boyn, and, being cut into\r\npieces of about two inches in thickness, it is placed in a sort of vat\r\nor sieve with many holes. A lid is placed upon it, and a slight\r\npressure, say from three to four stone avoirdupois; and the curd is\r\nturned up and cut small every ten or fifteen minutes, and occasionally\r\npressed with the hand so long as it continues to discharge scrum. When\r\nno more whey can be drawn off by these means, the curd is cut as small\r\nas possible with the knife, the proper quantity of salt minutely mixed\r\ninto it in the curd-boyn, and placed in the chessart within a shift of\r\nthin canvas, and put under the press.\r\n\r\nAll these operations ought to be carried on and completed with the least\r\npossible delay, and yet without precipitation. The sooner the whey is\r\nremoved after the coägulation of the milk, so much the better. But, if\r\nthe curd is soft, from being set too cold, it requires more time, and to\r\nbe more gently dealt with, as otherwise much of the curd and of the fat\r\nwould go off with the whey; and when the curd has been formed too hot,\r\nthe same caution is necessary. Precipitation, or handling the curd too\r\nroughly, would add to its toughness, and expel still more of the oily\r\nmatter; and, as has been already mentioned, hot water or whey should be\r\nput on the curd when it is soft and cold, and cold water when the curd\r\nis set too hot.\r\n\r\nUndue delay, however, in any of these operations, from the time the milk\r\nis taken out of the coolers until the curd is under the press in the\r\nshape of a cheese, is most improper, as the curd in all these stages is,\r\nwhen neglected for even a few minutes, very apt to become ill-flavored.\r\nIf it is allowed to remain too long in the curd-vat, or in the dripper\r\nover it, before the whey is completely extracted, the curd becomes too\r\ncold, and acquires a pungent or acrid taste; or, it softens so much that\r\nthe cheese is not sufficiently adhesive, and does not easily part with\r\nthe serum. Whenever the curd is completely set, the whey should be taken\r\noff without delay; and the dairymaid should never leave the curd-boyn\r\nuntil the curd is ready for the dripper or cheese-vat. The salt is mixed\r\ninto the curd.\r\n\r\nAfter the cheese is put into the press, it remains for the first time\r\nabout an hour, or less than two hours, until it is taken out, turned\r\nupside down in the cheese-vat, and a new cloth put around it every four\r\nor six hours until the cheese is completed, which is generally in the\r\ncourse of a day and a half, two, or at most in three days after it was\r\nfirst put under the press.\r\n\r\nSome have shortened the process of pressing by placing the cheese--after\r\nit has been under the press for two hours or so for the first time--into\r\nwater heated to about one hundred or one hundred and ten degrees, and\r\nallowing the cheese to remain in the water about the space of half an\r\nhour, and thereafter drying it with a cloth, and putting it again under\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nWhen taken from the press, generally after two or three days from the\r\ntime they were first placed under it, they are exposed for a week or so\r\nto the warmth and heat of the farmer’s kitchen,--not to excite sweating,\r\nbut merely to dry them a little before they are placed in the store,\r\nwhere a small proportion of heat is admitted. While they remain in the\r\nkitchen they are turned over three or four times every day; and,\r\nwhenever they begin to harden a little on the outside, they are laid up\r\non the shelves of the store, where they are turned over once a day or\r\nonce in two days for a week or so, until they are dry, and twice every\r\nweek afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe store-houses for cheese in Scotland are in proportion to the size of\r\nthe dairy,--generally a small place adjoining the milk-house, or in the\r\nend of the barn or other buildings, where racks are placed, with as many\r\nshelves as can hold the cheeses made in the season. When no particular\r\nplace is prepared, the racks are placed in the barn, which is generally\r\nempty during summer; or some lay the cheeses on the floor of a garret\r\nover some part of their dwelling-house.\r\n\r\nWherever the cheeses are stored, they are not sweated or put into a warm\r\nplace, but kept cool, in a place in a medium state, between damp and\r\ndry, without the sun being allowed to shine on them, or yet a great\r\ncurrent of air admitted. Too much air, or the rays of the sun, would dry\r\nthe cheeses too fast, diminish their weight, and make them crack; and\r\nheat would make them sweat or perspire, which extracts the fat, and\r\ntends to induce hooving. But when they are kept in a temperature nearly\r\nsimilar to that of a barn, the doors of which are not much open, and but\r\na moderate current of air admitted, the cheeses are kept in a proper\r\nshape,--neither so dry as to rend the skin, nor so damp as to render\r\nthem mouldy on the outside; and no partial fermentation is excited, but\r\nthe cheese is preserved sound and good.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCH CHEESE--The most celebrated of the Dutch cheeses is the Edam, of\r\nNorth Holland, and the Gouda. The manufacture of these and other\r\nvarieties will be described in a subsequent chapter, on Dairy Husbandry\r\nin Holland.\r\n\r\nThe PARMESAN is an Italian cheese, made of one meal of milk, allowed to\r\nstand sixteen hours, to which is added another which has stood eight\r\nhours. The cream being taken from both, the skim-milk is heated an hour\r\nover a slow fire, and constantly stirred till it reaches about\r\neighty-two degrees, when the rennet is put in and an hour allowed to\r\nform the curd. The curd is thoroughly broken or cut, after which a part\r\nof the whey is removed, and the curd is then heated nearly up to the\r\nboiling point, when a little saffron is added to color it. It then\r\nstands over the fire about half an hour, when it is taken off, and\r\nnearly all the rest of the whey removed, cold water being added, till\r\nthe curd is cool enough to handle. It is then surrounded with a cloth,\r\nand, after being partially dried, is put into a hoop and remains there\r\ntwo days. It is then sprinkled with salt for thirty days in summer, or\r\nabout forty in winter. One cheese is then laid above another to allow\r\nthem to take the salt; after which they are scraped and cleansed every\r\nday, and rubbed with linseed-oil to preserve them from the attack of\r\ninsects, and they are ready for sale at the age of six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN CHEESE, as it is called in the English markets, whither large\r\nquantities are shipped for sale, is made of almost every conceivable\r\nvariety and quality, from the richest Cheddar or Cheshire to the poorest\r\nskim-milk cheese. The statements of some of the best dairymen have\r\nalready been given. As a further illustration of the mode pursued in\r\nother sections of the country, the statement of C. G. Taylor, a\r\nsuccessful competitor for the premiums offered by the Illinois State\r\nAgricultural Society, may be given as follows:\r\n\r\n“As the milk is drawn from the cows, it is immediately strained into a\r\nvat. This vat is a new patent, and is better than any I have ever seen\r\nfor cheese-making. It is double, a space being left between the two\r\nparts. Into the upper vat the milk is strained, and cold water is\r\napplied between it and the lower one. Thus the animal heat is soon\r\nexpelled, and the milk is prevented from souring before morning. The\r\nmorning milk is added. Under the lower vat a copper boiler is arranged.\r\nThe water in the boiler is in perfect connection with that remaining all\r\naround the upper or milk vat, connected with three copper pipes. With a\r\nlittle wood the water is warmed. Thus the temperature of the milk is\r\nsoon brought to the desired point to receive the rennet, which is about\r\nninety to ninety-five degrees. Sufficient rennet is applied to the milk\r\nto cause it to curdle or coägulate in from thirty to forty minutes. Then\r\nthe curd is carefully cut, each way, into slices of about one inch\r\nsquare. Soon the temperature is slowly increased. In about twenty\r\nminutes the curd is carefully broken up with the hand,--increasing the\r\nheat, and stirring often. When the curd is sufficiently hard, so as to\r\n“_squeal_” when you bite it, it is scalded. By this time the temperature\r\nis up to about one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty.\r\n\r\n“There are hinges placed in the legs of one end of the vat, which is\r\neasily tipped, and through the curd-strainer and whey-gate the whey is\r\nsoon run off. The curd is then dipped into a sink, over which is placed\r\na coarse strainer, and allowed to drain quite dry. It is then broken up\r\nfine, and one teacup of ground solar salt added to curd to make twenty\r\npounds of cheese, and well worked in. After the curd is quite cool, it\r\nis placed in the hoop, and a light pressure is applied. In a few minutes\r\nmore power is needed. After remaining in press about six hours, it is\r\ntaken out of the hoop, wholly covered with strong muslin, finely sewed\r\non, and then reversed and replaced in the hoop and press. It is allowed\r\nto remain until the next day, when it has to give place for another.\r\n\r\n“After pressing thus twenty-four hours, the cheese is placed upon the\r\nshelf, and allowed to stand until the cloth is dry. Then a preparation,\r\nmade from annatto and butter-oil, is applied sufficiently to fill all\r\nthe interstices of the cloth. It must be turned and thoroughly rubbed\r\nthree times a week, until ripe for use.\r\n\r\n“I use the self-acting press. I know of none in use that is better,--the\r\nweight of the cheese being the power.”\r\n\r\nThe statements of skilful and practical dairymen, in different parts of\r\nthe country, are sufficient to show that good cheese can be produced;\r\nbut it is believed that a more general attention to all the details of\r\nthe dairy would add many thousand dollars a year to the wealth of the\r\npeople, and enable us to compete successfully with the best dairy\r\ncountries in the world.\r\n\r\nThe composition of cheese will, of course, differ widely in nutritive\r\nvalue, according to the mode of manufacture, age, etc. A specimen of\r\ngood cheese was found to contain about 31.02 per cent. of flesh-forming\r\nsubstances, 25.30 per cent. of heat-producing substances, 4.90 per cent.\r\nof mineral matter, and 38.78 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nThe analyses of several varieties will serve as a comparison of cheese\r\nwith other kinds of food. The Cheddar was a rich cheese two years old,\r\nthe double Gloucester one year old, the Dunlop one year old, the\r\nskim-milk one year.\r\n\r\n  --------+--------+---------+-------+-----\r\n          |        |   Dbl.  |       |Skim-\r\n          |Cheddar.|Glo’ster.|Dunlop.|milk.\r\n          +--------+---------+-------+-----\r\n  Water,  |  30.04 |  35.81  | 38.46 |43.82\r\n  Caseine,|  28.98 |  37.96  | 25.87 |45.04\r\n  Fat,    |  30.40 |  21.97  | 31.86 | 5.98\r\n  Ash,    |   4.58 |   4.25  |  8.81 | 5.18\r\n  --------+--------+---------+-------+-----\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnston gives a table of comparison of Cheddar and skim-milk\r\ncheese in a dried state, and milk, beef, and eggs, also in a dried\r\nstate, as follows:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+---------+-----+-----\r\n                 |     |Cheddar|Skim-milk|     |\r\n                 |     |cheese,| cheese, |     |\r\n                 |Milk.| dried.|  dried. |Beef.|Eggs.\r\n                 +-----+-------+---------+-----+-----\r\n  Caseine (curd),|  35 |   45  |    80   |  89 |  55\r\n  Fat (butter),  |  24 |   48  |    11   |   7 |  40\r\n  Sugar,         |  37 |    -  |     -   |   - |   -\r\n  Mineral matter,|   4 |    7  |     9   |   4 |   5\r\n                 +-----+-------+---------+-----+-----\r\n                 | 100 |  100  |   100   | 100 | 100\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+---------+-----+-----\r\n\r\nA full-milk cheese differs but little from pure milk, except in the\r\nabsence of sugar, which, as already seen, is held in solution, and goes\r\noff in the whey. The difference becomes greater in proportion as the\r\ncream is removed from the milk before curding, and the nutritive\r\nqualities thereby diminished.\r\n\r\nCheese is used both as a regular article of food, for which the ordinary\r\nkinds of full-milk cheeses are admirably fitted, and as a condiment or\r\ndigester, in connection with other articles of food; and for this\r\npurpose the stronger varieties, such as are partially decayed and\r\nmouldy, are best. “When the curd of milk is exposed to the air in a\r\nmoist state, for a few days, at a moderate temperature, it begins\r\ngradually to decay, to emit a disagreeable odor, and to ferment. When\r\nin this state, it possesses the property, in certain circumstances, of\r\ninducing a species of chemical change and fermentation in other moist\r\nsubstances with which it is mixed, or is brought into contact. It acts\r\nafter the same manner as sour leaven does when mixed with sweet dough.\r\nNow, old and partially decayed cheese acts in a similar way when\r\nintroduced into the stomach. It causes chemical changes gradually to\r\ncommence among the particles of the food which has previously been\r\neaten, and thus facilitates the dissolution which necessarily precedes\r\ndigestion. It is only some kinds of cheese, however, which will effect\r\nthis purpose. Those are generally considered the best in which some kind\r\nof cheese-mould has established itself. Hence, the mere eating of a\r\nmorsel of cheese after dinner does not necessarily promote digestion. If\r\ntoo new, or of improper quality, it will only add to the quantity of\r\nfood with which the stomach is probably already overloaded, and will\r\nhave to await its turn for digestion by the ordinary processes.” This\r\nmouldiness and tendency to decay, with its flavor and digestive quality,\r\nare often communicated to new cheese by inoculation, or insertion of a\r\nsmall portion of the old into the interior of the new by means of the\r\ncheese-taster.\r\n\r\nIn studying attentively the practice of the most successful\r\ncheese-makers, I think it will be observed that they are particularly\r\ncareful about the preparation of the rennet, and equally so about the\r\ndetails of pressing. In my opinion, the point in which many American\r\ncheese-makers fail of success is in hurrying the pressing. I think it\r\nwill be found that the best cheese is pressed two days, at least, and in\r\nmany cases still longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF DAIRY STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairy stock, properly fed and managed, is liable to few diseases in this\r\ncountry, notwithstanding the sudden changes to which our climate is\r\nsubject. If pure air, pure water, a dry barn or pasture, and a frequent\r\nbut gradual change of diet, when kept in the stall, are provided for\r\nmilch cows, nature will generally remedy any derangements of the system\r\nwhich may occur, far better than art. Common sense is especially\r\nrequisite in the treatment of stock, and that will very rarely dictate a\r\nresort to bleeding, boring the horns, cutting off the tail, and a\r\nthousand other equally absurd practices, too common even within the\r\nmemory of men still living.\r\n\r\nThe diseases most to be dreaded are garget, puerperal or milk fever, and\r\nidiopathic or common fever, commonly called “horn ail,” and often “tail\r\nail.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGARGET is an inflammation of the internal substance of the udder. One or\r\nmore of the teats, or whole sections of the udder, become enlarged and\r\nthickened, hot, tender, and painful. The milk coägulates in the bag, and\r\ncauses inflammation where it is deposited, which is accompanied by\r\nfever. It most commonly occurs in young cows after calving, especially\r\nwhen in too high condition. The secretion of milk is very much lessened,\r\nand, in very had cases, stopped altogether. Sometimes the milk is\r\nthick, and mixed with blood. Often, also, in severe cases, the hind\r\nextremities, as the hip-joint, hock, or fetlock, are swollen and\r\ninflamed to such an extent that the animal cannot rise. The simplest\r\nremedy, in mild cases, is to put the calf to its mother several times a\r\nday. This will remove the flow of milk, and often dispel the congestion.\r\n\r\nSometimes the udder is so much swollen that the cow will not permit the\r\ncalf to suck. If the fever increases, the appetite declines, and\r\nrumination ceases. In this stage of the complaint, the advice of a\r\nscientific veterinary practitioner is required. A dose of purging\r\nmedicine and frequent washing of the udder, in _mild_ cases, are usually\r\nsuccessful. The physic should consist of Epsom salts one pound, ginger\r\nhalf an ounce, nitrate of potassa half an ounce; dissolved in a quart of\r\nboiling water; then add a gill of molasses, and give to the cow\r\nlukewarm. Diet moderate; that is, on bran, or if in summer green food.\r\nThere are various medicines for the different forms and stages of\r\ngarget, which, if the above medicine fails, can be properly prescribed\r\nonly by a skilful veterinary practitioner.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the udder should be frequently examined, as matter\r\nmay be forming, which should be immediately released. Various causes are\r\nassigned for this disease, such as exposure to cold and wet, or the want\r\nof proper care or attention in parturition.\r\n\r\nAn able writer, Mr. Youatt, says that hasty drying up a cow often gives\r\nrise to inflammation and indurations of the udder, difficult of removal.\r\nSometimes a cow lies down upon and bruises the udder, and this is\r\nanother cause. But a very frequent source, and one for which there can\r\nbe no excuse, is the failure to milk a cow clean. The calf should be\r\nallowed to suck often, and the cow should be milked at least twice a\r\nday as clean as possible, while suffering from this complaint.\r\n\r\nIf the udder is hot and feverish, a wash may be used, consisting of\r\neight ounces of vinegar and two ounces of camphoretted spirit; the whole\r\nwell and thoroughly mixed, and applied just after milking, to be washed\r\noff in warm water before milking again.\r\n\r\nIn very bad cases, iodine has often been found most effectual. An iodine\r\nointment may be prepared by taking one drachm of hydriodate of potash\r\nand an ounce of lard, and mixing them well together. A small portion of\r\nthe mixture, from the size of a pigeon’s egg, in limited inflammations,\r\nto twice that amount, is to be well rubbed into the swollen part,\r\nmorning and night.\r\n\r\nWhen milk forms in the bag before parturition, so as to cause a swelling\r\nof the udder, it should be milked away; and a neglect of this precaution\r\noften leads to violent attacks of garget.\r\n\r\nPrevention is always better than cure. The reason most commonly given\r\nfor letting the cow run dry for a month or two before calving is that\r\nafter a long period of milking her system requires rest, and that she\r\nwill give more milk and do better the coming season than if milked up to\r\nthe time of calving.\r\n\r\nThis is all true, and a reason sufficient in itself for drying off the\r\ncow some weeks before parturition; but there is another important reason\r\nfor the practice, which is that the mixture of the old milk with the new\r\nsecretion is liable to end in an obstinate case of garget.\r\n\r\nTo prevent any ill effects from calving, the cow should not be suffered\r\nto get too fat, which high feeding after drying off might induce.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation is about two hundred and eighty-four or two\r\nhundred and eighty-five days. But cows sometimes overrun their time, and\r\nhave been known to go three hundred and thirteen days, and even more;\r\nwhile they now and then fall short of it, and have been known to calve\r\nin two hundred and twenty days. If they go much over the average time,\r\nthe calf will generally be a male. But cows are sometimes liable to\r\nslink their calves; and this usually takes place about the middle of\r\ntheir pregnancy. To avoid the evil consequences, so far as possible,\r\nthey should be watched; and, if a cow is found to be uneasy and\r\nfeverish, or wandering about away from the rest of the herd, and\r\napparently longing for something she cannot get, she ought to be taken\r\naway from the others.\r\n\r\nIf a cow slinks her calf while in the pasture with others, they will be\r\nliable to be affected in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, physicking will quiet the cow’s excitement in the\r\ncondition above described, and prove of essential benefit. A dose of one\r\npound of Epsom or Glauber’s salts, and one ounce of ginger, mixed in a\r\npint of thick gruel, should be given first, to be immediately followed\r\nby the salts, in a little thinner gruel.\r\n\r\nWhen a cow once slicks her calf, there is great risk in breeding from\r\nher. She is liable to do the same again. But when the slinking is caused\r\nby sudden fright or over-exertion, or any offensive matter, such as\r\nblood or the dead carcasses of animals, this result is not so much to be\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nBut the cow, when about to calve, ought not to be disturbed by too\r\nconstant watching. The natural presentation of the fœtus is with the\r\nhead lying upon the fore legs. If in this position, nature will\r\ngenerally do all. But, if the presentation is unnatural, and the labor\r\nhas been long and ineffectual, some assistance is required. The hand,\r\nwell greased, may be introduced, and the position of the calf changed;\r\nand, when in a proper position, a cord should be tied round the fore\r\nlegs, just above the hoofs; but no effort should be made to draw out the\r\ncalf till the natural throes are repeated. If the nostril of the calf\r\nhas protruded, and the position is then found to be unnatural, the head\r\ncannot be thrust back without destroying the life of the calf.\r\n\r\nThe false position most usually presented is that of the head first,\r\nwith the legs doubled under the belly. A cord is then fixed around the\r\nlower jaw, when it is pushed back, to give an opportunity to adjust the\r\nfore legs, if possible. The object must now be to save the life of the\r\ncow.\r\n\r\nBut the cases of false presentation, though comparatively rare, are so\r\nvaried that no directions could be given which would be applicable in\r\nall cases.\r\n\r\nAfter calving the cow will require but little care, if she is in the\r\nbarn, and protected from changes of weather. A warm bran mash is usually\r\ngiven, and the state of the udder examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUERPERAL OR MILK FEVER.--Calving is often attended with feverish\r\nexcitement. The change of powerful action from the womb to the udder\r\ncauses much constitutional disturbance and local inflammation. A cow is\r\nsubject to nervousness in such circumstances, which sometimes extends to\r\nthe whole system, and causes puerperal fever. This complaint is called\r\n_dropping_ after calving, because it succeeds that process. The\r\nprominent symptom is a loss of power over the motion of the hind\r\nextremities, and inability to stand; sometimes loss of sensibility in\r\nthese parts, so that a deep puncture with a pin, or other sharp\r\ninstrument, is unfelt.\r\n\r\nThis disease is much to be dreaded by the farmer, on account of the high\r\nstate of excitement and the local inflammation. Either from neglect or\r\nignorance, the malady is not discovered until the manageable symptoms\r\nhave passed, and extreme debility has appeared. The animal is often\r\nfirst seen lying down, unable to rise; prostration of strength and\r\nviolent fever are brought on by inflammation of the womb. But soon a\r\ngeneral inflammatory action succeeds, rapid and violent, with complete\r\nprostration of all the vital forces, bidding defiance to the\r\nbest-selected remedies.\r\n\r\nCows in very high condition, and cattle removed from low keeping to high\r\nfeeding, are the most liable to puerperal fever. It occurs most\r\nfrequently during the hot weather of summer, and then it is most\r\ndangerous. When it occurs in winter, cows sometimes recover. In hot\r\nweather they usually die.\r\n\r\nMilk fever may be induced by the hot drinks often given after calving. A\r\nyoung cow at her first calving is rarely attacked with it. Great milkers\r\nare most commonly subject to it; but all cows have generally more or\r\nless fever at calving. A little addition to it, by improper treatment or\r\nneglect, will prevent the secretion of milk; and thus the milk, being\r\nthrown back into the system, will increase the inflammation.\r\n\r\nThis disease sometimes shows itself in the short space of two or three\r\nhours after calving, but often not under two or three days. If four or\r\nfive days have passed, the cow may generally be considered safe. The\r\nearliest symptoms of this disease are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe animal is restless, frequently shifting her position; occasionally\r\npawing and heaving at the flanks. Muzzle hot and dry, the mouth open,\r\nand tongue out at one side; countenance wild; eyes staring. She moans\r\noften, and soon becomes very irritable. Delirium follows; she grates her\r\nteeth, foams at the mouth, tosses her head about, and frequently injures\r\nherself. From the first, the udder is hot, enlarged, and tender; and if\r\nthis swelling is attended by a suspension of milk, the cause is clear.\r\nAs the case is inflammatory, its treatment must be in accordance; and\r\nit is usually subdued without much difficulty. Mr. Youatt says, “The\r\nanimal should be bled, and the quantity regulated by the impression made\r\nupon the circulation,--from six to ten quarts often before the desired\r\neffect is produced.” He wrote at a time when bleeding was adopted as the\r\nuniversal cure, and before the general reasoning and treatment of\r\ndiseases of the human system was applied to similar diseases of animals.\r\nThe cases are very rare, indeed, where the physician of the present day\r\nfinds it necessary to bleed in diseases of the human subject; and they\r\nare equally rare, I apprehend, where it is really necessary or judicious\r\nto bleed for the diseases of animals. A more humane and equally\r\neffectual course will be the following:\r\n\r\nA pound to one and a half pounds of Epsom or Glauber’s salts, according\r\nto the size and condition of the animal, should be given, dissolved in a\r\nquart of boiling water; and, when dissolved, add pulv. red pepper a\r\nquarter of an ounce, caraway do. do., ginger do. do.; mix, and add a\r\ngill of molasses, and give lukewarm. If this medicine does not act on\r\nthe bowels, the quantity of ginger, capsicum, and caraway, must be\r\ndoubled. The insensible stomach must be roused. When purging in an early\r\nstage is begun, the fever will more readily subside. After the operation\r\nof the medicine, sedatives may be given, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe digestive function first fails, when the secondary or low state of\r\nfever comes on. The food undischarged ferments; the stomach and\r\nintestines are inflated with gas, and swell rapidly. The nervous system\r\nis also attacked, and the poor beast staggers. The hind extremities show\r\nthe weakness; the cow falls, and cannot rise; her head is turned on one\r\nside, where it rests; her limbs are palsied. The treatment in this\r\nstage must depend on the existence and degree of fever. The pulse will\r\nbe the only true guide. If it is weak, wavering, and irregular, we must\r\navoid depleting, purgative agents. The blood flows through the arteries,\r\nimpelled by the action of the heart, and its pulsations can be very\r\ndistinctly felt by pressing the finger upon almost any of these arteries\r\nthat is not too thickly covered by fat or the cellular tissues of the\r\nskin, especially where it can be pressed upon some hard or bony\r\nsubstance beneath it. The most convenient place is directly at the back\r\npart of the lower jaw, where a large artery passes over the edge of the\r\njawbone to ramify on the face. The natural pulse of a full-grown ox will\r\nvary from about forty-eight to fifty-five beats a minute; that of a cow\r\nis rather quicker, especially near the time of calving; and that of a\r\ncalf is quicker than that of a cow. But a very much quicker rate than\r\nthat indicated will show a feverish state, or inflammation; and a much\r\nslower pulsation indicates debility of some kind.\r\n\r\nNext in importance, as we have already stated, is the physic. The bowels\r\nmust be opened, or the animal will fall a victim to the disease. All\r\nmedicines should be of an active character, and in sufficient quantity;\r\nand stimulants should always be added to the purgative medicines, to\r\ninsure their operation. Ginger, gentian, caraway, or red pepper in\r\npowder, may be given with each dose of physic. Some give a powerful\r\npurgative, by means of Epsom salts one pound, flour of sulphur four\r\nounces, powdered ginger a quarter of an ounce, all dissolved in a quart\r\nof cold water, and one half given twice a day till the bowels are\r\nopened. The digestive organs are deranged in most forms of milk fever,\r\nand the third stomach is loaded with hard, indigestible food. When the\r\nmedicine has operated, and the fever is subdued, little is required but\r\ngood nursing to restore the patient.\r\n\r\nNo powerful medicines should be used without discretion; for in the\r\nmilder forms of the disease, as the simple palsy of the hind\r\nextremities, the treatment, though of a similar character, should be\r\nless powerful, and every effort should be made for the comfort of the\r\ncow, by providing a thick bed of straw, and raising the fore quarters to\r\nassist the efforts of nature, while all filth should be promptly and\r\ncarefully removed. She may be covered with a warm cloth, and warm gruel\r\nshould be frequently offered to her, and light mashes. An attempt should\r\nbe made several times a day to bring milk from the teats. The return of\r\nmilk is an indication of speedy recovery.\r\n\r\nMilch cows in too high condition appear to have a constitutional\r\ntendency to this complaint, and one attack of it predisposes them to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE FEVER.--This may be considered as increased arterial action, with\r\nor without any local affection; or it may be the consequence of the\r\nsympathy of the system with the morbid condition of some particular\r\npart. The first is pure or idiopathic fever; the other, symptomatic\r\nfever. Pure fever is of frequent occurrence in cattle. Symptoms as\r\nfollows: muzzle dry; rumination slow or entirely suspended; respiration\r\nslightly accelerated; the horn at the root hot, and its other extremity\r\nfrequently cold; pulse quick; bowels constipated; coat staring, and the\r\ncow is usually seen separated from the rest of the herd. In slight\r\nattacks, a cathartic of salts, sulphur, and ginger, is sufficient. But,\r\nif the common fever is neglected, or improperly treated, it may assume,\r\nafter a time, a local determination, as pleurisy, or inflammation of the\r\nlungs or bowels. In such cases the above remedy would be insufficient,\r\nand a veterinary surgeon, to manage the case, would be necessary.\r\nSymptomatic fever is more dangerous, and is commonly the result of\r\ninjury, the neighboring parts sympathizing with the injured part. Cattle\r\nbecome unwell, are stinted in their feed, have a dose of physic, and in\r\na few days are well; still, a fever may terminate in some local\r\naffection. But in both cases pure fever is the primary disease.\r\n\r\nA more dangerous form of fever is that known as symptomatic. As we have\r\nsaid, cattle are not only subject to fever of common intensity, but to\r\nsymptomatic fever, and thousands die annually from its effects. But the\r\nyoung and the most thriving are its victims. There are few premonitory\r\nsymptoms of symptomatic fever. It often appears without any previous\r\nindications of illness. The animal stands with her neck extended, her\r\neyes protruding and red, muzzle dry, nostrils expanded, breath hot, base\r\nof the horn hot, mouth open, pulse full, breathing quick. She is often\r\nmoaning; rumination and appetite are suspended; she soon becomes more\r\nuneasy; changes her position often. Unless these symptoms are speedily\r\nremoved, she dies in a few hours. The name of the ailment, inflammatory\r\nor symptomatic fever, shows the treatment necessary, which must commence\r\nwith purging. Salts here, as in most inflammatory diseases, are the most\r\nreliable. From a pound to a pound and a half, with ginger and sulphur,\r\nis a dose, dissolved in warm water or thin gruel. If this does not\r\noperate in twelve hours, give half the dose, and repeat once in twelve\r\nhours, until the bowels are freed. After the operation of the medicine\r\nthe animal is relieved. Then sedative medicines may be given. Sal\r\nammoniac one drachm, powdered nitre two drachms, should be administered\r\nin thin gruel, two or three times a day, if required.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever, common in some countries, is little known here among\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER sometimes follows intense inflammatory action, and is\r\nconsidered the second stage of it. This form of fever is usually\r\nattended with diarrhœa. It is a debilitating complaint, and is sometimes\r\nfollowed by diseases known as black tongue, black leg, or quarter evil.\r\nThe cause of typhoid fever is involved in obscurity. It may be proper to\r\nsay that copious drinks of oat-meal gruel, with tincture of red pepper,\r\na diet of bran, warmth to the body, and pure air, are great essentials\r\nin the treatment of this disease.\r\n\r\nThe barbarous practices of boring the horns, cutting the tail, and\r\nothers equally absurd, should at once and forever be discarded by every\r\nfarmer and dairyman. Alternate heat or coldness of the horn is only a\r\nsymptom of this and other fevers, and has nothing to do with their\r\ncause. The horns are not diseased any further than a determination of\r\nblood to the head causes a sympathetic heat, while an unnatural\r\ndistribution of blood, from exposure or other cause, may make them cold.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of this kind, if anything is done, it should be an effort\r\nto assist nature to regulate the animal system, by rousing the digestive\r\norgans to their natural action, by a light food, or, if necessary, a\r\nmild purgative medicine, followed by light stimulants.\r\n\r\nThe principal purgative medicines in use for neat cattle are Epsom\r\nsalts, linseed-oil, and sulphur. A pound of salts will ordinarily be\r\nsufficient to purge a full-grown cow.\r\n\r\nA slight purgative drink is often very useful for cows soon after\r\ncalving, particularly if feverish, and in cases of over-feeding, when\r\nthe animal will often appear dull and feverish; but when the surfeiting\r\nis attended by loss of appetite, it can generally be cured by\r\nwithholding food at first, and then feeding but slightly till the system\r\nis renovated by dieting.\r\n\r\nPurgative drinks will often cure cases of red water, if taken in season.\r\n\r\nA purgative is often necessary for cows after being turned into a fresh\r\nand luxuriant pasture, when they are apt to become bound from\r\nover-feeding; but constipation does not so often follow a change from\r\ndry to green food in spring, as from a poor pasture in summer to one\r\nwhere they obtain much better feed.\r\n\r\nThe HOOVE or HOVEN is brought on by a derangement of the digestive\r\norgans, occasioned by over-feeding on green and luxuriant clover, or\r\nother luxuriant food. It is simply the distension of the first stomach\r\nby carbonic acid gas. In later stages, after fermentation of the\r\ncontents of the stomach has commenced, hydrogen gas is also found. The\r\ngreen food, being gathered very greedily after the animal has been kept\r\non dry and perhaps unpalatable hay, is not sent forward so rapidly as it\r\nis received, and remains to overload and clog the stomach, till this\r\norgan ceases or loses the power to act upon it. Here it becomes moist\r\nand heated, begins to ferment, and produces a gas which distends the\r\npaunch of the animal, which often swells up enormously. The cow is in\r\ngreat pain, breathing with difficulty, as if nearly suffocating. Then\r\nthe body grows cold, and, unless relief is at hand, the cow dies.\r\n\r\nPrevention is both cheaper and safer than cure; but if by neglect, or\r\nwant of proper precaution, the animal is found in this suffering\r\ncondition, relief must be afforded as soon as possible, or the result\r\nwill be fatal.\r\n\r\nA hollow flexible tube, introduced into the gullet, will sometimes\r\nafford a temporary relief till other means can be had, by allowing a\r\npart of the gas to escape; but, the cause is not removed either by this\r\nmeans or by puncturing the paunch, which is often dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the early stage of the disease the gas may be neutralized by ammonia,\r\nwhich is usually near at hand. Two ounces of liquid ammonia, in a quart\r\nof distilled or rain water, given every quarter of an hour, will prove\r\nbeneficial. A little tincture of ginger, essence of anise-seed, or some\r\nother cordial, may be added, without lessening the effect of the\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nIf the case has assumed an alarming character, the flexible tube, or\r\nprobang, may be introduced, and afterwards take three drachms either of\r\nthe chloride of lime or the chloride of soda, dissolve in a pint of\r\nwater, and pour it down the throat. Lime-water, potash, and sulphuric\r\nether, are often used with effect.\r\n\r\nIn desperate cases it may be found necessary to make an incision through\r\nthe paunch; but the chloride of lime will, in most cases, give relief at\r\nonce, by neutralizing the gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOKING is often produced by feeding on roots, particularly round and\r\nuncut roots, like the potato. The animal slavers at the mouth, tries to\r\nraise the obstruction from the throat, often groans, and appears to be\r\nin great pain. Then the belly begins to swell, from the amount of gases\r\nin the paunch.\r\n\r\nThe obstruction, if not too large, can sometimes be thrust forward by\r\nintroducing a flexible rod, or tube, into the throat. This method, if\r\nadopted, should be attended with great care and patience, or the tender\r\nparts will be injured. If the obstruction is low down, and a tube is to\r\nbe inserted, a pint of olive or linseed oil first turned down will so\r\nlubricate the parts as to aid the operation, and the power applied must\r\nbe steady. If the gullet is torn by the carelessness of the operator, or\r\nthe roughness of the instrument, a rupture generally results in serious\r\nconsequences. A hollow tube is best, and if the object is passed on into\r\nthe paunch, the tube should remain a short time, to permit the gas to\r\nescape. In case the animal is very badly swelled, the dose of chloride\r\nof lime, or ammonia, should be given, as for the hoove, after the\r\nobstruction is removed.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken, after the obstruction is removed, to allow no\r\nsolid food for some days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL IN THE FOOT.--Cows and other stock, when fed in low, wet pastures,\r\nwill often suffer from ulcers or sores, generally appearing first\r\nbetween the claws. This is commonly called foul in the foot, and is\r\nanalogous to foot-rot in sheep. It is often very painful, causing severe\r\nlameness and loss of flesh, and discharges a putrid matter, or pus.\r\nSometimes it first appears in the form of a swelling near the top of the\r\nhoof, which breaks and discharges foul matter.\r\n\r\nThe rough and common practice among farmers is to fasten the foot in the\r\nsame manner as the foot of an ox is fastened in shoeing, and draw a\r\nrough rope back and forth over the ulcerated parts, so as to produce a\r\nclean, fresh wound, and then dress it with tar or other similar\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThis is often an unnecessarily cruel operation. The loose matter may\r\neasily be removed by a knife, and then carefully wiped off with a moist\r\nsponge. The animal should then be removed at once to a warm, dry\r\npasture, or kept in the barn.\r\n\r\nIf the case has been neglected till the pasterns become swollen and\r\ntender, the sore may be thoroughly cleansed out, and dressed with an\r\nointment of sulphate of iron one ounce, molasses four ounces, simmered\r\nover a slow fire till well mixed. Apply on a piece of cotton batting,\r\nand secure upon the parts. If any morbid growth or fungus appear, use\r\nequal parts of powdered blood-root and alum sprinkled on the sore, and\r\nthis will usually effect a cure.\r\n\r\nSome also give a dose of flour of sulphur half an ounce, powdered\r\nsassafras-bark one ounce, and burdock two ounces, the whole steeped in a\r\nquart of boiling water, and strained when cool; and, if the matter still\r\ncontinues to flow from the sore, wash it morning and night with chloride\r\nof soda one ounce, or a tablespoonful of common salt dissolved in a pint\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nFoul in the foot causes very serious trouble, if not taken in season.\r\nThe health of cows is injured to a great extent. I have seen, during the\r\npresent season, many instances of foul in the foot in dairy stock\r\narising from the wetness of the pastures. No lameness in cattle should\r\nbe neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED WATER is so called from the high color of the urine. It is rather a\r\nsymptom of some derangement of the digestive organs than a disease of\r\nitself, and the cause is most frequently to be found in the quality of\r\nthe food. It is peculiar to certain localities, and is of very rare\r\noccurrence in New England.\r\n\r\nIn the early stage of the difficulty the bowels are loose, but soon\r\nconstipation ensues, and the appetite is affected, the milk decreases,\r\nand the urine becomes either very red or sometimes black.\r\n\r\nThe case demands treatment, for it is apt to prey upon the health of the\r\ncow. Purgatives are usually employed with most success. Take a pound of\r\nEpsom salts, half an ounce of ginger, and half an ounce of carbonate of\r\nammonia. Pour a quart of boiling water on the salts and ginger, stir\r\nthoroughly, and, when cold, add the ammonia. If this fails to act on the\r\nbowels, repeat a quarter part of it every six or eight hours till it\r\nsucceeds. Then a nutritious diet should be used till the appetite is\r\nfully restored.\r\n\r\nIf a cow is once affected in this way, the difficulty will be liable to\r\nreturn, and she had better be disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOSE is a cold or cough to which stock are subject when exposed to wet\r\nweather and damp pastures.\r\n\r\nThe cold may not be bad at first, or may be so slight as not to attract\r\nattention; but it often leads to worse complaints, and ought, when\r\nobserved, to be attended to at once, by keeping the animal in a dry and\r\nwarm barn a few days, and feeding with mashes, and, if it continues,\r\ntake an ounce of sweet spirits of nitre in a pint of ginger tea; mix,\r\nand give in a quart of thick gruel.\r\n\r\nNo prudent farmer will neglect to observe approaching symptoms of\r\ndisease in his stock. The cheapest way to keep animals healthy is to\r\ntreat them properly in time, and before disease is seated upon them.\r\nHoose often ends in consumption and death.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE GLANDS often occurs in hoose, catarrh, etc., but\r\nthey resume their natural state when these complaints are removed. The\r\nanimal cannot swallow without pain sometimes, and soft feed should be\r\ngiven. Remove the cause, and the inflammation ceases. Some make a\r\nrelaxing poultice of marsh-mallows, or similar substances; and rub the\r\nthroat with a mixture of olive or goose oil one gill, spirit of camphor\r\none ounce, oil of cedar one ounce, and half a gill of vinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.--Common catarrh or hoose sometimes leads to\r\ninflammation of the lungs, which is indicated by dulness and sore cough.\r\nThe ears, the roots of the horns, and legs, are sometimes cold. The\r\nbreath is hot, as well as the mouth; and the animal rarely lies down,\r\nand is reluctant to move, or change its position. Warm water and mashes,\r\nor gruel, may be given, and the animal kept in a dry place. The cause\r\nof the complaint should be removed, and the trouble will generally soon\r\ncease. The treatment is much the same as for fever; but where the\r\nsurface of the body is cold, as is generally the case, give sweet\r\nspirits of nitro two ounces, liquor acetate of ammonia four ounces, in a\r\npint of water, two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHŒA is brought on by too sudden change of food, especially from dry\r\nto green and succulent food; sometimes by poisonous plants or bad water.\r\nIf slight, the farmer may not be anxious to check it. It may show simply\r\nan effort of nature to throw off some injurious substances from the\r\nbody, and so it may exist when the animal is quite healthy. But, if it\r\ncontinues too long, and is likely to debilitate the system, a mild\r\npurgative may be given to assist rather than check the operation of\r\nnature. Half a pound of Epsom salts, with a little ginger and gentian,\r\nwill do for a medium-sized animal in this case; but a purgative may be\r\nfollowed in a day or two by an astringent medicine. Take prepared chalk\r\ntwo ounces, powdered oak-bark one ounce, powdered catechu two drachms,\r\npowdered opium one drachm, and four drachms powdered ginger. Mix these\r\ntogether, and give in a quart of warm gruel. Sometimes a few ounces of\r\npulverized charcoal will arrest the diarrhœa. Common diarrhœa may be\r\ndistinguished from dysentery by a too abundant discharge of dung in too\r\nfluid a form, or in a full, almost liquid stream, sometimes very\r\noffensive to the smell, and now and then bloody. In dysentery, the dung\r\nis often mixed with mucus and blood, and is not unfrequently attended by\r\na hard straining. The quantity of dung is less than in diarrhœa, but\r\nmore offensive.\r\n\r\nDiarrhœa may occur at any season of the year, and sometimes leads to\r\ndysentery, which more frequently appears in the spring and fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY, or scouring rot, is a dangerous and troublesome malady when\r\nit becomes seated.\r\n\r\nThe cow suffers from painful efforts to pass the dung, which is thin,\r\nslimy, olive-colored, and offensive, and after it falls rises up in\r\nlittle bubbles, with a slimy substance upon it. She is restless, lying\r\ndown and soon rising again, and appears to be in great distress. The\r\nhair seems to stand out stiff from the body, and this stage of the\r\nmalady indicates an obstinate and fatal disease.\r\n\r\nIt is often brought on by a simple cold at the time of calving, exposure\r\nto sudden changes, and by poor keeping, which exhausts the system,\r\nespecially in winter. A dry, warm barn, and careful nursing, will do\r\nmuch; and dry, sweet food, as hay, oat-meal, boiled potatoes, gruel, &c.\r\nSome linseed-meal is also very good for cows with this complaint. A\r\nlittle gum-arabic or starch may be mixed with the medicine.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is much the same as for diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nThe MANGE is commonly brought on by half starving in winter, and by\r\nkeeping the cow in a filthy, ill-ventilated place. It is contagious, and\r\nif one cow of a herd has it, the rest will be apt to get it also. Blaine\r\nsays, “Mange has three origins,--filth, debility, and contagion.” It is\r\na disgrace to the farmer to suffer it to enter his herd from either of\r\nthese causes, since it shows a culpable neglect of his stock. I am sorry\r\nto say it is too common in this country, especially in filthy barns.\r\n\r\nThe cow afflicted with the mange is hide-bound; the hair is dry and\r\nstiff, and comes off. She is constantly rubbing, and a kind of white\r\nscurfiness appears on the skin. It is most perceptible towards the\r\nlatter part of winter and in spring, and thus too plainly tells the\r\nstory of the winter’s neglect.\r\n\r\nAn ointment composed chiefly of sulphur has been found most effectual.\r\nSome mercurial ointment may be added, if the cows are kept housed; but,\r\nif let out during the day, the quantity must be very small, else\r\nsalivation is produced by their licking themselves.\r\n\r\nThe ointment may be made of flour of sulphur one pound, strong mercurial\r\nointment two ounces, common turpentine one half-pound, lard one and a\r\nquarter pounds. Melt the turpentine and lard together, and stir in the\r\nsulphur as they begin to cool off; then rub down the mercurial ointment\r\non some hard substance with the other ingredients. Rub the whole in with\r\nthe hand, and take care to leave no places untouched, once a day, for\r\nthree days; and after this, if any places are left uncured, rub it in\r\nover them. There is no danger in this application, if the animal is not\r\nexposed to severe cold. This will be pretty sure to effect a speedy\r\ncure, if aided by cleanliness, pure air, and a nutritious diet.\r\n\r\nAnother wash for mange is the following: Pyroligneous acid four ounces,\r\nwater a pint; mix and apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE show unpardonable neglect of duty wherever they are suffered to\r\nexist. They crawl all over the stable-floor and the stalls, on the\r\npastures, and a touch is sufficient to give them to other animals. They\r\nworry and trouble the poor animal constantly; and no thriftiness can be\r\nexpected where they are found. If the mange ointment does not completely\r\ndestroy them, as it often will, take bees-wax, tallow, and lard, in\r\nequal parts, and rub it into the hide in the most thorough manner, with\r\nthe hand or a brush, two and a half pounds for a small cow, three pounds\r\nfor a large one. The next day it may be washed off in soft soap, and the\r\nlice will have disappeared from the animal, but not always from the\r\nbarn. Some use a wash of powdered lobelia-seeds two ounce; steeped in\r\nboiling water, and applied with a sponge. Others hang up tobacco-leaves\r\nover the stalls. This may do to keep them away; but, after the animal is\r\ncovered with them, they are not so easily scared.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARBLES.--The gad-fly is very troublesome to cattle towards the end of\r\nsummer. The fly alights on the back of the cow, punctures the skin, and\r\nlays her eggs under it. A tumor is now formed, varying in size, which\r\nsoon bursts and leaves a small hole for the grub already hatched to\r\nbreathe through. Here the insect feeds on its surroundings, and grows up\r\nto considerable size. All this time the animal is probably suffering\r\nmore or less pain, and often tries to lick or rub the part affected, if\r\npossible. Farmers often press them out with the finger and thumb. The\r\nbest way is to puncture the skin with a common pen-knife, and then press\r\nout the grub. They injure the hide more than most people are aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF CUD is a consequence of indigestion, and is often brought on by\r\neating too greedily of food which the cow is not used to. Loss of cud\r\nand loss of appetite are synonymous. Gentle purgatives may be given,\r\nwith such as salts, ginger, and sulphur. But when a cow is surfeited, as\r\nalready said, I should prefer to withhold food entirely, or for the most\r\npart, till the system can regulate itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF CALVES.--The colostrum, or first milk of the cow after\r\ncalving, contains medicinal qualities peculiarly adapted to cleanse the\r\nyoung calf, and free its bowels from the matter always existing in them\r\nat birth. This should, therefore, never be denied it. Bleeding at the\r\nnavel, with which calves are sometimes seriously troubled, may generally\r\nand safely be stopped by tying a string around the cord which hangs\r\nsuspended from it.\r\n\r\nBut DIARRHŒA, PURGING, or SCOURS, is the most dangerous complaint with\r\nwhich calves are afflicted. This is caused often by neglect, or exposure\r\nto wet and cold, or insufficiency of food at one time and over-feeding\r\nat another. Stinting the calf in food or attention will often involve\r\nthe loss of considerable profit on the cow for the year. When purging is\r\nonce fully seated from several days’ neglect, it is often difficult to\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nThe acidity on the stomach which always attends it must first be\r\nremoved. A mild purgative medicine may be given. Rhubarb and magnesia is\r\na very convenient article, and may easily be given in ounce doses along\r\nwith the milk. Potash is also to be given in quarter-ounce doses in the\r\nsame way. Two ounces of castor-oil, or two ounces of Epsom salts, might\r\nbe given with the desired effect. After this, mild astringents may be\r\ngiven. Take prepared chalk two drachms, or magnesia one ounce, powdered\r\nopium ten grains, powdered catechu half a drachm, tincture of capsicum\r\ntwo drachms, essence of peppermint five drops. Mix together, and give\r\ntwice a day in the milk or gruel.\r\n\r\nAfter giving the above repeatedly without effect, which will rarely\r\nhappen, take Dover’s powders two scruples, starch or arrow-root powdered\r\none ounce, cinnamon powder one drachm, and powdered kino half a drachm.\r\nBoil the starch or arrow-root in water till it thickens, and when cold\r\nstir in the other ingredients. Give night and morning. This complaint is\r\noften attended by inflammation of the bowels and general fever.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to keep a lump of chalk constantly before calves after\r\nthey are two or three weeks old. It corrects acidity on the stomach, and\r\nis otherwise useful to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION or COSTIVENESS sometimes attacks calves a few days old,\r\nthat have not been judiciously managed. It may be brought on by putting\r\na calf to a cow whose milk is too old, or from feeding a calf from the\r\nmilk of several cows mixed. It results from too heavy a mass of\r\ncoägulated milk in the fourth stomach, which becomes very much swollen\r\nwith hard curd. It is difficult to remedy. The best way is to pour down\r\nsome Epsom salts, two ounces, dissolved in two quarts of warm water, by\r\nmeans of a horn or bottle, and follow this by half the dose every six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nConstipation sometimes appears in calves from two to four months old,\r\nwhen their food is too suddenly changed. The bowels must be opened and\r\nthe hardened mass in the stomach softened very soon, or it will lead to\r\nfatal consequences.\r\n\r\nFarmers are generally very careless about observing these things till it\r\nis too late. As already said, prevention is cheaper than cure; but, if\r\nthe complaint once appears, no time should be lost to administer a purge\r\nof salts in proportion to the size of the animal or the severity of the\r\nattack. Many a valuable animal will be saved by it.\r\n\r\nThe HOOVE often appears among calves after being turned out to pasture.\r\nThe young animal coughs violently, and appears in pain. It should be\r\nremoved at once to a dry place, and physicked. If taken in season, it is\r\neasily cured. If neglected, it will often prove fatal. This complaint\r\nassumes the form of an epidemic at times, and becomes very prevalent and\r\ntroublesome.\r\n\r\nCalves sometimes suffer from CANKER IN THE MOUTH, especially at the time\r\nof teething. The gums swell, and fever sets in. Common alum or borax,\r\ndissolved in water, may be applied, and a mild purgative administered,\r\nin the shape of one or two ounce doses of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\nThe diseases and complaints mentioned above are nearly all that afflict\r\nour dairy stock; and the list at least includes all the common diseases\r\nand their treatment. Some of the diseases and epidemics from which the\r\ncattle of Great Britain and other countries suffer are not known at all\r\nhere, or are of so very rare occurrence as not to have attracted\r\nattention; and among these may be named pleuro-pneumonia, typhus fever,\r\ncow-pox, and various epidemics which have from time to time decimated\r\nthe cattle of all Europe. To accidents of various kinds, to wounds,\r\ntrouble with the eyes, and to lameness from other causes than those\r\nnamed, they are, indeed, more or less subject; but no work could\r\nanticipate or cover the treatment best in every case, and much must be\r\nleft to the judgment of the owner.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make this chapter, which I consider one of the most\r\nimportant of any to the dairy farmer, of practical value to every one\r\nwho owns or has the care of a cow. But, lest a want of familiarity with\r\nsome of the medicines recommended for particular diseases, or the fear\r\nof the expense of procuring and keeping them on hand, should deter some\r\none from providing himself with a good medicine-chest, I wish to remind\r\nthe reader that no small portion of them are always to be found in every\r\nwell-regulated household, and that the others are obtained at so little\r\nexpense that no one need be without them for a single day.\r\n\r\nLet us see, for instance, how many of them are at hand. But few families\r\nare destitute of a supply of ginger, camphor, red pepper, lard,\r\nmolasses, cinnamon, peppermint, starch, turpentine, tallow, bees-wax,\r\nburdock, and caraway-seed. The farmer’s wife or daughter will generally\r\nhave a supply of ammonia or hartshorn.\r\n\r\nNow, I wish to suggest to the farmer or dairyman who happens to live at\r\na distance from the apothecary to provide himself with a convenient\r\nlittle medicine-chest, and put into it say four times the quantities of\r\nthe various medicines which are mentioned in the preceding pages,\r\ncarefully bottled and labelled for use. To aid in this simple plan,\r\nwhich might be the means of saving an animal worth twenty times its\r\ncost, I have obtained, from a _wholesale_ druggist, about the average\r\ncost of the following quantities and kinds of medicines, which include\r\nall, or nearly all, that would be likely to be needed: Five pounds of\r\nEpsom salts, .18; one pint of castor-oil, .25; one pint of sweet spirits\r\nof nitre, .19; one pound of powdered nitrate of potash, .20; one pound\r\ncarbonate of ammonia, .23; one half-pound sal ammoniac, .08; one pint of\r\ntincture of red pepper (hot drops), .31; one ounce of hydriodate of\r\npotash, .30; one pound chloride of lime, .10; one pound sulphate of\r\niron, .10; 2 pounds powdered sulphur, .16; one pint of tincture of\r\nginger, 37; one quart of essence of anise-seed, .50; one half-pound\r\nsulphuric ether, .20; one half-pound powdered sassafras-bark, .20; one\r\nquarter-pound magnesia, .06; one quarter-pound rhubarb, 30 (the common\r\nwill answer instead of prepared); one ounce powdered opium, .43; One\r\nquarter-pound catechu, .06; one ounce Dover’s powders, .25; 2 ounces gum\r\nkino, .05; one half-pound mercurial ointment, .37¹⁄₂; and one pound\r\naloes, .25. Then keep in the chest a good probang, which is a flexible\r\ntube made for the purpose, and is much safer and better for introducing\r\ninto the throat or gullet of an animal than a common whip-stick, which\r\nsome use. This costs about $3.50, and can be procured at almost any\r\nveterinary surgeon’s. This whole chest and contents will cost less than\r\nten dollars.\r\n\r\nLet the farmer also become familiar with the structure and anatomy of\r\nhis animals. It will open a wide field of useful and interesting\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY HUSBANDRY OF HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n  This chapter I translate from an admirable little work in German,\r\n  “_Die Holländische Rindviehzucht und Milchwirthschaft im Königreich\r\n  Holland_,” by Ellerbrock, a distinguished veterinary surgeon,\r\n  professor of cattle pathology and cattle-breeding in the Agricultural\r\n  Institute at Zeyst, in Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKING AND TREATMENT OF MILK.--The cows are turned to pasture early in\r\nspring, and stay there day and night throughout the pasture-season. They\r\nare milked daily in a particular part of the lot called the milk-yard.\r\nThis is kept in some instances permanently in the same place; in others,\r\nit is changed about at pleasure. A shady part of the pasture is\r\ngenerally selected, and it is commonly enclosed with a board fence. The\r\ncows are driven into this yard to be milked, when not already there at\r\nthe usual time. The milking is done by male and female domestics, who\r\ncarry their pails, cans, and dishes, hung on a kind of wooden yoke, Fig.\r\n84, neatly cut out, painted, and set with copper nails. This is swung\r\nover the shoulders, or else the dairy utensils are carried on donkeys,\r\nponies, or hand-carts; or, where there is water communication, in boats,\r\ntwice a day, to the yard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.]\r\n\r\nIn the larger dairies the utensils in common use are small wooden pails,\r\nFig. 85, painted in variegated colors, with bright brazen or iron hoops,\r\nand neatly washed; a strainer, Fig. 86, made of horse-hair; a large\r\nwooden tunnel, Fig. 87, for pouring the milk into the cans and casks;\r\none or more buckets, Fig. 88, usually of brass, lined with tin, large\r\nenough to hold the milk of several cows together, or from twelve to\r\neighteen quarts. In many dairies they have wooden buckets, Fig. 85,\r\npainted green or blue outside, with black stripes, and with iron or\r\nbrass handles, kept very bright. Here the buckets are coated over inside\r\nwith white oil-colors. These are borne by the yoke (Fig. 84), or in some\r\nof the ways indicated above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.]\r\n\r\nIn many places, instead of buckets for keeping the milk together, they\r\nuse copper or brass cans lined inside with tin, and in the form of\r\nantique vases or large beer-jugs, Figs. 90 and 91, which are constantly\r\nkept brightly polished. In other places, they use for holding the milk\r\nsmaller or larger barrels, Fig. 92, with broad hoops also kept\r\nconstantly polished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.]\r\n\r\nInstead of the yoke a soft cushion is also used, which the dairymaids\r\nstrap over their backs, so that they hang down and rest over the hips\r\nand thighs. On this cushion the cans are laid, and fastened with broad\r\nhempen straps, that they may not press too heavily upon the body. This\r\nband is called the milk-strap. Where the milk is carried home on a\r\nhand-cart, neatly-woven baskets are fastened upon little wagons in which\r\nthe cans are placed. If it is to be carried in casks, the same\r\narrangement is fixed upon a hand-cart. Two wooden floats are laid upon\r\nthe milk in the buckets, in order to protect it from slopping over. One\r\nor more large milk-casks or tubs, in which it may cool off properly, are\r\nalso used. The size of these tubs is different, as well as the materials\r\nof which they are made. Where the cooling is not left to the air alone,\r\nbut is sought to be effected by hanging the milk-tub into cold water,\r\nthe vessels are made of metal. The large vase-like jars are also used\r\nfor this purpose. These hold about thirty cans, or twenty-six quarts.\r\nWooden bowls are used, of different sizes and forms, and earthen pans,\r\nrather deeper than broad, Figs. 93 and 94, in which the milk as it cools\r\nis set for the cream to rise. A large pot for collecting the cream\r\nuntil there is enough to churn, and wooden skimmers for taking off the\r\ncream, are also used. The milker sits upon a common four-legged, and\r\nsometimes one-legged milking-stool, and milks either the teats on one\r\nside, or one hind and one front teat, the pail being held between the\r\nknees. The cows are milked regularly at four or five o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and at five or six in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.]\r\n\r\nIn West Friesland, North and South Holland, Utrecht, and other places,\r\nit is customary to tie the tail to the leg of the cow, that she may not\r\nannoy the milker. Most cows do not resist this, being accustomed to it\r\nfrom the beginning. They also pass a cord around the horns and tie her\r\nto a post stuck in the ground during the milking, as in Fig. 95. In many\r\nprovinces only the unruly cows are tied in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.]\r\n\r\nThe milking takes place on the right side of the cow, so that the\r\nmilker sits on this side. In West Friesland and North Holland there is\r\nan exception to this rule. The cows are tied in pairs in the stalls, and\r\none is milked on one side and the other on the other, the milker sitting\r\nwith his back to the board partition, to avoid annoyance from either\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nWhen the milking is ended the milk is poured through the hair strainer\r\ninto the bucket, or through a strainer or tunnel in the cans or casks,\r\nwhichever are used. The milk is taken to the dairy-house, without delay,\r\nin some of the ways already mentioned. When the yoke is used, one bucket\r\nis hung on the right side and another on the left, each with a float on\r\nthe top of the milk to keep it from slopping over. The large metallic\r\nmilk-cans, with wooden stoppers, are borne home on the cushions already\r\ndescribed as being held by shoulder-knots strapped round the waist. The\r\nmode of transportation depends much on the distance from the dairy-house\r\nand the quantity to be carried.\r\n\r\nIn winter, when the cows are in the barn, they are likewise milked twice\r\na day, and the milk is at once strained through the hair strainer into\r\ncasks made for the purpose. These implements differ according to the\r\nobject pursued in the dairy; yet pans and pots are mostly used for\r\nraising the cream to be made into butter, since but few dairymen make\r\ncheese in winter.\r\n\r\nAll utensils necessary for milking, the preservation of milk, and the\r\nmaking of butter and cheese, are kept with the utmost neatness. Where a\r\nstream of running water flows through the yard, the implements are\r\ngenerally washed in that, and flowing water is preferred for the\r\npurpose. But where the farm or dairy-house stands at a distance from a\r\nstream, a shallow fountain, or basin, is dug out in the earth, walled\r\nup, and so arranged that the water can be taken from it and fresh water\r\nsubstituted when it gets impure. In such a basin, or in flowing water,\r\nall new wooden dairy utensils are soaked for a long time before being\r\nused; but those in daily use are washed, rinsed, and scoured out with\r\nashes, with the greatest care. None but cold, clear, fresh fountain or\r\nflowing water is taken for cleansing dairy implements. It is to be\r\nobserved that, in large dairies, the use of water which is covered with\r\nnewly-fallen honey-dew, for washing the dairy utensils, is carefully\r\navoided. When the milk-vessels have been perfectly rinsed out in fresh\r\nwater, they are, in many dairies, put into a large kettle of water over\r\nthe fire, and properly scalded; after which they are again cleanly\r\nwashed with cold water, so that not the least particle of milk or\r\nimpurity is to be seen, nor the least smell of it to be observed. The\r\nmetallic milk-vessels and the metal parts of the wooden ones are\r\ncleansed with equal care and exactness, and kept polished. Dairymaids\r\nfeel a pride in always having the brightest, most polished, and cleanest\r\nutensils, and each strives earnestly to excel the others in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk-vessels are scoured, scalded, and rinsed perfectly clean,\r\nthey are hung on a stand of laths and poles, made for the purpose, to be\r\nproperly dried. The round wooden milk-bowls, being made of one piece,\r\nare very easily broken or split, and must be handled with very great\r\ncare in cleaning. To avoid breaking, a peculiar table is used for\r\nscouring them.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch dairyman knows perfectly well that his dairy can secure him\r\nthe highest profit only when the utmost cleanliness is the basis and\r\ngroundwork of his whole business; and so he keeps, with the most\r\nextraordinary carefulness, and even with anxiety, the greatest possible\r\nneatness in all parts of the dairy establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF THE MILKING QUALITIES OF THE COWS.--The Dutch cattle\r\nare, in general, renowned for their dairy qualities; but especially so\r\nare the cows of North Holland, which not only give a large quantity, but\r\nalso a very good quality, so that a yield of sixteen to twenty-five\r\ncans[2] at every milking is not rare. Next to these come the West\r\nFriesland and South Dutch cows, from which from twenty to twenty-four\r\ncans of milk may be calculated on. Though one could not take a certain\r\nnumber and calculate surely what the yield of each cow would be, yet he\r\ncould come very near the truth if he reckoned that a cow, in three\r\nhundred days, or as long as she is milked, gives, on an average, daily,\r\nfrom six to eight cans of milk, from which the whole annual yield would\r\nbe from one thousand eight hundred to two thousand four hundred cans. Of\r\nthis the cow gives one half in the first four months, one third in the\r\nnext three, and in the remainder one sixth. These superficial results\r\ncannot be taken, however, as the fixed rule.\r\n\r\n  [2] A Dutch can is a little less than our wine quart\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilkins, in his Handbook of Agriculture, gives the following\r\nestimates of the yield of milk: A good West Friesland or Gröningen cow\r\nwill, after calving, give daily fourteen quarts of milk. This will,\r\nafter a while, be reduced to eight quarts. She may be milked three\r\nhundred and twenty-three days in the year, and her product in butter and\r\ncheese will amount to one hundred güldens.\r\n\r\nIn Prof. Kop’s Magazine it is stated that a medium-sized Friesland cow,\r\nwhich had had several calves, was giving daily, on good feed, five and a\r\nhalf to six buckets, or from twenty to twenty-two cans, and over. In\r\nSouth Holland, also, this quantity is considered a good yield of a cow.\r\nOf the cows of Gelderland, Overyssel, and Utrecht, the yield cannot be\r\nreckoned higher than sixteen cans daily, and that only during the first\r\nhalf of their milking season.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MILK FOR BUTTER.--To get good butter it is quite necessary\r\nthat the fresh milk be properly cooled before it is set for cream. In\r\nthe great dairies of North and South Holland, which not only possess the\r\nbest cattle, but may be given as models in dairy husbandry, they manage\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe milk, as it is brought from the pasture, is poured from the buckets,\r\ncans, and casks, through a hair strainer, into one vessel, the\r\nmilk-kettle. These milk-kettles are not everywhere of the same size, or\r\nof similar form, but are always riveted together with strong brass or\r\ncopper bands, and lined with tin inside. The most common milk-kettles\r\nhold sixteen cans; yet they are found so large as to hold three barrels,\r\nor about six hundred quarts. The peculiar kettle form is very rarely\r\nfound, but more frequently the cylindrical, or vase-shaped. They are\r\nheld either by two handles or one. The number required depends on the\r\nnumber of cows and the quantity of milk expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Cool-bath.]\r\n\r\nThe milk-kettles, when filled, are set into a basin with cold water,\r\ncalled the cool-bath, for the purpose of cooling the milk. The cool-bath\r\nis frequently in the kitchen, sometimes in the bauer-house, so called,\r\nor directly before the cow-room, near the spring. The latter is the most\r\ncommon and the most convenient place. The water reservoir is dug in the\r\nground, and an oblong four-cornered form is preferred for it; the sides\r\nof the excavation being walled up with hard-burnt building-stones and\r\ncement, but the bottom is laid in tiles, either red, hard-burnt, or\r\nwhite glazed. Richer dairymen take finely-hewn blue stone or white\r\nmarble for it. The size of the reservoir is governed by the number of\r\nmilk-kettles to be put into it, and so is its depth by their height, so\r\nthat the rim of the kettle is on a level with the top of the cool-bath,\r\nFig. 96. The sides of the cool-bath in the kitchen project some feet\r\nover the floor, yet are not so high that the setting in and taking out\r\nthe milk-kettle will be attended with great inconvenience and trouble.\r\nWhere it is desired to make the work of setting in or raising up the\r\nmilk-kettles from the cool-bath as easy as possible, a beam is fixed\r\nalong the side of the trough, and iron props are firmly fixed, which\r\nextend out a little over the edge of the trough, half-way down from the\r\nbeam. On these the operator can support himself in lowering or raising\r\nheavy vessels. These stays, or props, are sometimes fixed directly into\r\nthe wall, along which the cool-bath stands. Under the bottom of the\r\nreservoir, on the other side from where the water comes in, is an\r\noutlet, stopped with a tap or faucet, to let off the water.\r\n\r\nThe cool-baths in the kitchen are, for the most part, on the floor, and\r\nextend up a convenient height; whilst those in the cow-barns, as a\r\ngeneral rule, are dug down and walled up, and their top is fastened to\r\nthe floor of the barn. They are deep enough to allow the water for\r\ncooling the milk to come up to the rim of the milk-kettle; but, in order\r\nto prevent men and cattle from falling in, it is covered with a strong\r\nwooden lid to shut down, as in Fig. 97.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Cool-bath.]\r\n\r\nSuch a cool-bath is used in the cow-room only in summer, when the heat\r\nis so great that it is difficult to keep the milk cool in the kitchen.\r\nThe cool-bath in the cow-room is considered as only an auxiliary to that\r\nin the kitchen, and to be used only in case of necessity. The\r\nmilk-kettles are hung by their handles, and let down by means of a\r\ncrank. When the platform is not in use it is taken away from the\r\ncool-bath, and the cover is let down and kept closed.\r\n\r\nThe milk is allowed to remain in the cool-bath until the froth has\r\ndisappeared, and there is no difference in temperature between the water\r\nand the milk. The milk of one milking must give place for the next, so\r\nthat it will be changed twice daily, morning and evening. A very great\r\nimportance is, everywhere in the Dutch dairies, attached to this rapid\r\ncooling of the milk, because it is known by experience that it is thus\r\ngreatly protected from turning sour.[3]\r\n\r\n  [3] It will be perceived that the arrangement for cooling the milk\r\n  before setting in the pans, in the Dutch dairies, is very elaborate. I\r\n  have followed the original in translating the above, though the\r\n  practice in Holland differs widely from our own in this respect, and\r\n  from that recommended in the preceding pages. The point may be worthy\r\n  of careful experiment.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\nThe milk, when properly cooled, is brought to the milk-cellar, where it\r\nis immediately poured out of the milk-kettles into vessels designed to\r\nreceive it. Wooden bowls or pans, or high earthen pots, are used for\r\nholding it. The pans and pots are set on the table, and a small ladder,\r\nor hand-barrow, is laid on there, on which is placed the strainer, when\r\nthe milk is poured from the kettles. The wooden milk-pans are of several\r\nforms, generally made of ash or of linden, and oval. They are, on an\r\naverage, three and a half feet long, and half a foot broad, more or\r\nless; but their dimensions vary.\r\n\r\nIt has been found, by experience, that the flatter and shallower the\r\npans, the quicker and better the cream rises. The milk-pots are pretty\r\nlarge, but are rather shallow than deep, glazed inside, of different\r\nforms, and different capacities; but they are always broader on the top\r\nthan at the bottom, though they stand firmly on a round, broad\r\nfoot-piece. Milk pans and pots are rinsed with cold water before the\r\nmilk is poured into them. When properly cleaned and filled, they are\r\nplaced on shelves made for the purpose, in regular rows. These shelves\r\nare only a few feet high above the floor of the cellar, and of suitable\r\nwidth; but, if there is not space enough for the milk, the pans are\r\nplaced on the bottom of the cellar. The pots are also set along the\r\nwalls, on firm board shelves.\r\n\r\nThe milk-cellar, or rather the milk-room, Fig. 98, in the North and\r\nSouth Dutch dairies, is placed on the north side of the house, next to\r\nthe kitchen, but a little lower than the latter, so that there are\r\nusually three steps down. The longer side, facing towards the north, has\r\none window, whilst the gable end, with its two windows, faces towards\r\nthe west. The windows are generally kept shut, and are open only nights\r\nin summer. The cellar is either arched or covered with strongly boarded\r\nrafters, over which the so-called cellar-chamber is situated. The floor\r\nof this room is laid in lime or cement, with red or blue burnt tiles, so\r\nthat nothing can pass down through into the milk-cellar. In the cellar\r\nitself are the above-mentioned shelves and platforms for the\r\nmilk-vessels along the walls, while outside, in front of the cellar,\r\nlinden and juniper trees are planted, to prevent as much as possible the\r\nheat of the sun from striking upon the walls. Cleanliness, the\r\nfundamental principle of Dutch dairy husbandry, is carried to its utmost\r\nextent in the cellar. Barrels of meat, bacon, vegetables of every\r\nkind, and everything which could possibly create a strong odor and\r\ninfect the air, or impart a flavor to the milk, butter, or cheese, are\r\ncarefully excluded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Dutch dairy-room.]\r\n\r\nThe vessels in which the milk is set remain standing undisturbed in\r\ntheir places, that the formation of cream may go on without\r\ninterruption. Twenty-four hours, on an average, are thought to be\r\nnecessary for the milk to stand, during which time the cream is twice\r\ntaken off, once at the end of each twelve hours. The morning’s milk is\r\nskimmed in the evening, and the evening’s on the next morning. But the\r\nmilk always remains quite still till the dairymaid thinks it time to\r\nskim, which she decides by the taste. Long practice enables her to judge\r\nwith great certainty by this mode of trial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.]\r\n\r\nWhen the cream is ripe it is taken off by the dairymaid with a shallow\r\nwooden skimmer, Fig. 99, in the form of a deep plate, and carefully\r\nplaced in a particular vessel--a bucket or cream-pot. The cream-pot is\r\ngenerally washed very clean, the staves very finely polished, striped\r\nwith blue or white outside, and held together by broad brass or copper\r\nhoops, kept very bright. For closing the jar they use an ashen cover,\r\nwhich is either simply laid on by a common handle, or sometimes held on\r\nby brass or copper hinges. Both cream-pot and cover are always scoured\r\nquite white and clean. The cream remains there till enough is got for\r\nchurning, or till it becomes of itself thick enough for butter. It is\r\nknown to be of the proper consistence for butter when a long, slender,\r\nwooden spoon, thrust down into it, will stand erect. When in summer the\r\ncream does not get thick enough in season, they seek to hasten it by\r\nputting in a little butter-milk; but in winter the ripening of the\r\ncream is hastened by warming, either by holding the cream-pot over a\r\ncoal-pan, or on a hearth-plate.\r\n\r\nThe remainder, the skim-milk from the milk bowls or pans, sour milk, or\r\nbutter-milk, is poured into a particular vessel, and made into\r\nspice-cheese.\r\n\r\nBesides the methods here described for keeping milk for butter, milk is\r\nused for other purposes. Sweet milk cheese is made of the unskimmed\r\nmilk; cream is used in the house for coffee. Rennet is also added to\r\nfresh milk, and the product is immediately sold, being greatly relished\r\nby many. From skim-milk and butter-milk put together is made an article\r\ncalled kramery by cooking the mixture, putting it into a linen bag, and\r\nhanging it in a cool part of the milk-cellar, or elsewhere, when the\r\nliquid drops out and leaves a mass of considerable consistence, called\r\nHangebast.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the milk is taken from the vessels, they are taken out of the\r\ncellar and carefully cleansed and dried before being used again.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CHURNING.--Churning is the principal operation in the\r\nmanufacture of butter, for by it the fatty particles are separated from\r\nthe other constituents. There are several methods in Holland of\r\neffecting this separation of the butter globules. The oldest and\r\nsimplest is that of putting the cream into an upright churn, in which\r\nthe cream is agitated by moving a long dasher, pierced with holes, up\r\nand down, till the object is accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.]\r\n\r\nThere are, strictly speaking, only two forms of the churn which are used\r\nin all parts of the country. One is broad at the bottom and narrow at\r\nthe top. This has been known from the earliest times, and is called the\r\nold churn, Fig. 100.\r\n\r\nThis old churn is still used in many dairies, and it has the preference\r\nover the other form, because it is thought to bring the butter quicker\r\nand more completely.\r\n\r\nThe other form is more like a beer or brandy cask on end, being smaller\r\nat each end than in the middle, and is called the barrel-churn. Both\r\nkinds are made of oak-wood, and have wooden or broad metal hoops. In the\r\none case they are painted outside; in the other, they remain of the\r\nnatural color, but are the more frequently scoured, so that the\r\ndark-colored oak-wood gets a whitish color. The metallic hoops are\r\nalways kept polished bright.\r\n\r\nBoth kinds are of different sizes, according as the quantity of cream is\r\ngreater or less, or as they are to be worked by hand or animal power\r\nsimply, or by machinery. In South Holland, where unquestionably the most\r\nbutter is made, the barrel-churn is at each end about two feet and two\r\ninches in diameter, and in the centre is seven inches broader, with\r\ntwo-inch staves. The old churn, on the other hand, is usually fourteen\r\ninches at the top and twenty-five at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn North Holland and West Friesland, also, sizes are found in which one\r\nhundred and fifty to two hundred quarts of cream can be churned. The\r\nchurns have each a strong cover at the top, which fits into their rim\r\nabout the thickness of the hand, with a hole in the middle for the\r\ndasher.\r\n\r\nThe churning is performed either by the hand motion of the dasher, as in\r\nall small dairies, and in the smallest churns, or by man-power with the\r\nhelp of certain mechanical contrivances. The means for effecting this\r\nare different, and so the churns have different names. In many dairies,\r\nfor instance, they have a lever connected with the dasher; in other\r\nplaces they use a flexible pole, fixed into the ceiling above, for\r\nfacilitating the motion of the dasher, or put a lever in motion with the\r\nfeet, which raises and sinks the dasher. There are also complicated\r\nartificial butter-machines and butter-mills, which are named after the\r\ninventor, the manufacturer, or the motive power. The most known and\r\nwidely used are the turning-mills, the wheel-mills, and the clock-work\r\nmills; as the Hand Butter-Mill of Valk, Fürst’s churn, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are also still more elaborate machine-works for moving the dasher,\r\nwhich are used in the larger dairies on account of their convenience and\r\neconomy. Dog-power and horse-power churns are frequently met with.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING IN THE COMMON CHURN.--The use of this is well known. The dasher\r\nis moved up and down by hand, with the churn full of cream, till the\r\nbutter particles are separated and collected together. The operator\r\nkeeps his body in equilibrium, to exercise the power of moving the\r\ndasher regularly for agitating the cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEVER CHURN is very commonly used in South Holland, Fig. 101. The\r\nchurn itself is barrel-form, as already described, and the dasher is put\r\nin motion by a lever. The upper end is pierced with holes, through which\r\nruns an iron pin. In a beam of the ceiling two joists are firmly fixed,\r\nabout a foot and five inches long and four inches square, and several\r\ninches apart. The longer arm of the lever is four feet and seven inches;\r\nthe shorter, three feet and six inches. The churn stands under the short\r\narm of the lever, where the dasher is fixed. By drawing the longer arm\r\nof the lever towards him, the operator presses the dasher down through\r\nthe cream. This mode is far less wearisome than the hand-churn, because\r\nby the lever, with less expense of power, a far greater agitation is\r\nproduced. A weight is sometimes attached to the longer arm, by which the\r\npower required is still further reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING WITH AN ELASTIC ROD.--The old-fashioned churn is set in motion\r\nby the aid of another kind of power, as seen in Fig. 102. A long, tough,\r\nflexible stick is fastened into the cross-beam in the ceiling, so that\r\nits larger end is held firm by two iron clasps. The elasticity of the\r\nrod is such that, when the smaller end is drawn down by hand, which, at\r\nthe same time, moves the dasher, it rebounds, and thus saves\r\nconsiderable expenditure of power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING WITH THE TREADLE LEVER.--In many places the churn is put in\r\nmotion by the feet, as in Fig. 103, where several levers are united to\r\nproduce the upward and downward motion of the dasher. The longer arm of\r\nthe lever is connected with the churn, and the shorter is set in motion\r\nby a foot-board. The foot-board lies on a roller, with its longer part\r\nattached to the lever; and by throwing the weight of the body upon this\r\npart the shorter arm of the lever is drawn down, and the longer,\r\nattached to the churn-dasher, is raised. The mode of operation is so\r\nplainly seen in the cut as to need no explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.]\r\n\r\nAmong the more ingenious contrivances used for churning in Holland\r\nbelongs the churn invented by Fürst. The body is somewhat similar to the\r\nbarrel-churn, but is smaller; and it is of uniform diameter throughout,\r\nas in Fig. 104. It is covered with a wooden lid, furnished with a\r\nconvenient handle, and stands on a low platform, to which it is fixed,\r\nwhen in use, by means of a screw, _k_. The motion is communicated to the\r\ndasher by means of a wheel, or windlass, and an endless cord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.]\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the cylinder is placed a kind of ventilator, Fig.\r\n105. This consists of eight wooden wings, pierced with holes, and motion\r\nis communicated to it by means of the wheel, _b_, connected by the cord\r\nto the larger windlass. The wings of the machine when set in motion,\r\nstrike incessantly in the cream, and so powerfully that the whole mass\r\nis agitated, and in this manner the separation of the butter particles\r\nis soon effected. The motion is so rapid that it is often necessary to\r\nturn the crank very slowly, especially just as the butter is coming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVALK’S HAND BUTTER-MILL, Fig. 106, has many advantages. It is less\r\nfatiguing to work than the old-fashioned churn, and even than Fürst’s,\r\nbecause the motion of the body required is simple and less exacting. And\r\nagain, the churn takes up less room, and is easily transported, which is\r\nan important consideration in churning, on account of the influence of\r\nthe temperature. In summer the heat may delay, or render the operation\r\ndifficult, and in winter the coldness presents obstacles. A\r\ntransportable churn can be moved into a cool place in summer, and a warm\r\none in winter, when it is desirable. The dasher of the churn is also\r\nseen separate in the same figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG-POWER CHURN, Fig. 107, economizes labor, while, at the same\r\ntime, more butter is obtained, on account of the uniformity of the\r\nagitation produced. It is in use in all the Dutch provinces. The form\r\nand size of the churn are comparatively indifferent; but the tread-wheel\r\nand direction of the moving power are the important points. The diameter\r\nof the wheel is from ten to twelve feet, and the rim or outer\r\ncircumference is made of boards two feet wide. The weight of the animal\r\nturns the wheel and moves the dasher by means of cogs, as shown in the\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a sufficient supply of moving power, a churn with two\r\ndashers is sometimes attached, as shown in Fig. 108, in which case one\r\ndasher moves down while the other is raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.]\r\n\r\nA large and strong dog is required, and he is easily taught to keep to\r\nhis work, by beginning with short trials, and gradually lengthening\r\nthem. A steady and uniform step is necessary, and this will soon be\r\nacquired. The dog is sometimes left free, and sometimes tied by a line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING BY HORSE-POWER.--On large farms and in extensive dairies the\r\nchurning is done by horse-power, as shown in Fig. 109. The form of the\r\nchurn itself is optional in this case, also. The size of the wheel\r\nvaries, but it is seldom less than nine or ten feet in diameter,\r\nfurnished with cogs on the upper surface, which are from four to six\r\ninches long, and play into a smaller wheel, the axle of which is\r\nattached to the dasher of the churn. A third and smaller wheel is\r\nsometimes introduced, as in Fig. 110. A quick and regular step is\r\nrequired of the animal, and a quiet and docile horse is always\r\npreferred. A horse adapted to this work commands a good price. Blinders\r\nare always used on the horse while churning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF THE CHURNING.--In whatever way the churning is performed,\r\nthe result is always a separation of the fatty particles from the other\r\nconstituents of the milk. As soon as the churning indicates that the\r\nbutter particles increase in size and collect together, the motion of\r\nthe dasher must be hastened till the butter has come together in a large\r\nmass. Great care should be taken to observe the appearance of this\r\nformation. The Dutch dairymaids acquire great skill, by long practice\r\nand experience, in judging of the proper moment when the separation of\r\nthe particles has completely taken place. Very great importance is with\r\njustice attached to this skill, for it is undoubtedly true that one with\r\nthis knowledge can get far more and better butter from milk of the same\r\nquality, the same quantity, and skimmed at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe cream taken from the milk of thirty-five cows, after standing\r\ntwenty-four hours, is generally churned in summer in less than an hour,\r\nsometimes in three quarters of an hour. In very hot weather the\r\ncream-pot is frequently set into the cool-bath of fresh water for five\r\nor six hours before the churning begins, and it churns the easier for\r\nit. Cold water is never poured into the churn with the cream. In\r\nwinter, as well as in cold weather in spring and fall, warm water is\r\nsometimes poured in with the cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING AND TREATMENT OF BUTTER.--When the churning is finished, the\r\ndairy-woman takes out the butter with a wooden scoop, Fig. 111, and puts\r\nit into a tub for further working. The tub, Fig. 112, is a broad,\r\nshallow vessel, open at the top, and having an opening at the bottom\r\nwhich is stopped by a bung. The scoop is pierced with holes, through\r\nwhich the butter-milk drains. The butter put into the tub is now rinsed,\r\nsalted, and formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.]\r\n\r\nThe tub is put upon a low, firm table, and the butter is worked by the\r\nhands, or by a shallow, rather wide and strong wooden ladle, until the\r\nbutter is united into one firm and entire mass. Many dairy-women are\r\naccustomed to work the butter out from the middle towards all sides\r\nbefore bringing the whole mass together in the tub. Then very clear and\r\npure fresh cold water is poured upon the butter, and worked through it\r\ntill all the milky particles are entirely removed. After this is done in\r\nseveral workings, the bung is removed from the bottom of the tub, and\r\nthe watery matter runs down through a little strainer, as in Fig. 113.\r\nAs a general rule, butter is washed with water and worked over eleven or\r\ntwelve times; yet the operator must judge whether the butter contains\r\nany particles of milk, and must work with water till, as it runs off, it\r\nis no longer whitish, but perfectly clear. Butter sometimes becomes too\r\nsoft from too much working, if it is all done at once; it is then worked\r\nover two or three times, and allowed to stand in cold water after each\r\nworking, which preserves its hardness and texture. This whole operation\r\nis called the washing of the butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.]\r\n\r\nWhen the washing is finished, the butter is cut with a blunt,\r\nsaw-toothed knife, Fig. 114, in every direction, in order to remove all\r\nhairs, or fibres of any kind, which by any possibility have got into it\r\nduring the day. It is then sprinkled over with white, finely-powdered\r\nsalt, the quantity of which is regulated by the taste; and this is\r\nperfectly worked in, so that the whole is uniformly salted. Most\r\ndairy-women determine the quantity of salt by the eye and the taste, and\r\nacquire such facility by continued practice that they always get the\r\nproper quantity; but less experienced ones take the salt by weight. The\r\nsalting is not all done at once, but is continued three or four days,\r\ntwelve hours intervening between each application, until all the salt\r\nhas dissolved, and not a crystal is to be found. If the butter has a\r\nspeckled and variegated appearance, it is a sign that the salt is not\r\ncompletely worked in, and the neglect must be remedied by working it\r\nover still more in the most thorough manner. When the salt is all\r\ndissolved, the butter is brought into single balls and got ready for the\r\nnext market-day, or the whole mass is put into a particular keg, in\r\norder to be taken to market at some subsequent time as firkin-butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORM OF FRESH BUTTER.--The form of the butter is made by taking a\r\nsuitable quantity and pressing it into a mould, and then taking it out\r\nby knocking on the mould. Many different forms of butter-moulds are in\r\nuse in the different sections of Holland, such as are shown in Figs.\r\n115, 116, and others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.]\r\n\r\nThe figures impressed on the butter are given by the mould, where it is\r\ndeeply engraved; or they are made after the butter is taken out of the\r\nmould, and for this purpose a peculiar instrument is used, Fig. 117, a\r\nkind of flat wooden spoon, with a short, convenient handle, and long\r\ngrooves in the broad, flat surface. Each region has its own peculiar\r\nstamp, or special figures, which are given to lump-butter, to which\r\nparticular attention is paid by the purchaser. The butter-dealer knows\r\nexactly that in one section butter is stamped in one way, in another\r\nsection in some other way; and that the butter of one section, with its\r\npeculiar stamp, is worth more than that of another.\r\n\r\nThe butter-moulds are generally made of linden-wood, but must always be\r\nlarge enough to hold at least a certain prescribed weight of butter; for\r\nall lump-butter brought for sale to the weekly market must be of a\r\nprescribed weight. This weight is very different, and almost every city\r\nhas different regulations and market customs; yet, in most places, a\r\npound is the legal weight. Certain market-masters, or inspectors of\r\nbutter, are appointed, and watch that all the butter has its proper\r\nweight. If too light, it is forfeited by the seller, who is also\r\npunished for fraud. The butter brought to market is generally covered\r\nwith very clean white cloths, and several sample lumps are put for\r\ninspection in a large butter-bowl, basket, or shallow box.\r\n\r\nMany dairymen are accustomed in spring, when the first grass butter is\r\nmade, to send their regular customers a few little lumps of fresh May or\r\ngrass butter. These presents generally have a peculiar form, and on the\r\nspecimens most carefully prepared some animal is moulded, as a sheep\r\nlying down, a dog, &c., with a bunch of green grass or buttercups in its\r\nmouth. The dairy-woman herself usually presents this butter in a\r\nbeautiful milk-bowl adorned with grass and flowers, covered with\r\nglittering white cloths.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACKING OF BUTTER IN FIRKINS AND BARRELS.--If the butter packed in\r\nfirkins and barrels is to be kept a long time, experience and knowledge\r\nare required to pack it so that it will not be injured. The form and\r\nsize of these casks are different in different sections and provinces.\r\nWhere butter-making forms a chief branch of dairy business, the\r\nparticular form and size which have been used for a long time are\r\nadhered to, because dairymen know very well that the public recognizes\r\ntheir choice butter by the form and size of the casks, and buys it the\r\nmore readily. The greatest anxiety of the Dutch butter-maker is to keep\r\nup the old, well-earned reputation which Dutch butter has in every\r\nforeign country, both for its intrinsic good qualities, the result of\r\nthe process of manufacture, and for its extraordinary appearance as an\r\narticle of commerce.\r\n\r\nFor the proper preservation of the good qualities of butter, it is of\r\nthe highest importance to have the casks properly made and treated; but\r\nthe mode of salting and packing the butter in them is also of special\r\nimportance, since this is examined at the sale. The old and customary\r\nforms and sizes of butter-casks are, therefore, of great consequence to\r\nthe butter-maker, because every butter-dealer and judge of butter\r\nrecognizes at once, by the external form of the casks, from what section\r\nthe butter comes, and makes up his mind on the money value of the\r\narticle from these appearances.\r\n\r\nIt was not originally known what kinds of wood were best for\r\ntransporting butter long distances in, and preserving its highest\r\nqualities; and butter-casks were made of several kinds of wood, as oak,\r\nbeech, willow, etc. But it was for the interest of the government that\r\nDutch butter should maintain its reputation for extraordinary qualities\r\nabroad, and the most rigid laws were enacted, prescribing from what wood\r\nthe casks should be made, etc.; and now only oak is allowed to be used,\r\nand the casks are all inspected and stamped according to\r\nlaw.  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nBefore the butter is packed the casks are properly cleaned and prepared,\r\nfor which practice and experience are requisite.\r\n\r\nOld butter-casks that have been previously used are cleaned of every\r\nparticle of fat and dirt remaining in them, and scoured and washed out\r\nas carefully as possible, and are placed for several days in running\r\nwater before they are used again. If no running water is at hand, quite\r\nclean pond or spring water is taken, and all impure water is carefully\r\navoided. After they have lain in the water five or six days, they are\r\ncarefully scoured out with good wood-ashes and sand, and again well\r\nrinsed. After several scourings and soakings, they are put into a kettle\r\nover a fire and carefully scalded; and then, when cold, again scoured\r\nand rinsed, for which the most judicious dairymen use milk instead of\r\nwater, and they are then placed to dry in the air. They are fit for use\r\nonly when everything has been done in the most careful manner.\r\n\r\nBut new butter-casks require still more particular and careful treatment\r\nbefore they can be filled with butter without fear of injury. They are\r\ngot ready for packing in several different ways. Some dairymen let them\r\nlie in pure water a whole summer and winter long, and wash them out in\r\nlye, and then treat them just as they do those that have been used.\r\nOthers, however, who give the new casks the preference over the old, but\r\nwho cannot wait for the soaking in lye over summer and winter, treat\r\nthem in the following manner: They prepare a lye of good American\r\npotash, which generally contains the most alkali, in a cask holding some\r\nthree hundred quarts, taking a pound of potash to twenty pounds of\r\nwater. For a cask of the size named fifteen pounds of potash are used,\r\nwhich is prepared by pouring boiling water upon it and stirring\r\nconstantly, adding a little more water as the potash dissolves. With\r\nthis lye, which will be about five degrees strong by Beaumé’s aërometer,\r\nthe butter-barrels are entirely filled. The barrels stand two hours\r\nfilled with lye, and are then emptied and exposed to the air to dry,\r\nwithout being scoured out with water or milk. The lye may be used again\r\nfor other new barrels, even though a part of its strength may be gone.\r\nPotash is added, from time to time, to keep up the specified degree of\r\nstrength. A solution of fifteen pounds of coarsely-powdered alum is\r\nprepared in about three hundred quarts of hot water, in a vessel as\r\nlarge as the lye-cask. The butter-barrels are also filled full of the\r\nsolution of alum, and allowed to stand twenty-four hours. This alum\r\nsolution must also be of five degrees strength by Beaumé’s scale, and\r\nit can be used over and over by adding more alum now and then. After\r\nemptying out the alum and lye, they are dried a day in the sun and air,\r\nand then rinsed out in fresh, pure water, when they can be used for\r\npacking butter without fear. Some add a little sulphate of iron or green\r\ncopperas to the alum, when the solution is more powerful; yet the\r\nmanagement of the butter-barrels is then more troublesome, and requires\r\nmore experience. The effect of the copperas has also the disadvantage\r\nthat it blackens the barrels, which, though it does not injure them, is\r\nnot liked by the purchaser.\r\n\r\nBy this treatment the new butter-barrels are much more quickly and\r\ncheaply cleansed, and got ready for packing and transporting butter,\r\nthan by the course pursued with old barrels. The barrels, treated as\r\nabove, are not only quite water-tight, but the wood is stronger and more\r\ndurable. By means of the potash-lye and the alum solution the tannin is\r\ntaken from the oak-wood used in the barrels, which, if it remained,\r\nwould give a disagreeable taste to the butter. The effect of the potash\r\nand alum upon the wood of the barrels is quite harmless, and does not\r\nimpart the least unhealthy quality to the butter.\r\n\r\nWhen the old or new barrels have been cleansed and prepared, in either\r\nof the ways indicated, suitably for packing the butter, the bottom of\r\nthe barrel is evenly covered with salt. Then a layer of butter which has\r\nbeen thoroughly washed and salted is made, and another layer of salt,\r\nand so alternate layers of salt and butter till the barrel is full, when\r\na little brine of salt and water is poured on top. The butter is now\r\nready to be laid in the cellar, and thence to be sold and exported. When\r\nthe dairy is not sufficiently large to fill a barrel each day, the\r\nbutter of several churnings must be used, and the barrel filled from\r\ntime to time as it stands in the cellar. In that case the upper layer of\r\nbutter is left covered with salt, and the cover of the barrel is closed\r\ndown tight. In most large dairies a barrel is generally filled at one\r\nchurning, which is considered better for the quality of the butter. The\r\nbutter is always packed in so firmly that no space is left unfilled.\r\n\r\nIn doing up butter for sale at home, or at a neighboring market, the\r\nlumps are worked into the form of half a sphere, and put into little\r\nbright-hooped boxes, made to fit into larger casks, which can be nicely\r\ncovered and closed up, as seen in Fig. 119, where the dairy-woman holds\r\na box in her hand. The covered casks are also seen carefully nailed up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.]\r\n\r\nThe buyer who wishes to try the butter uses a long iron or steel borer,\r\nhollow inside, and furnished with a handle, as also seen in the cut.\r\nThis not only enables him to test the quality but the uniformity of the\r\nbutter in the cask.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORING OF BUTTER.--The practice of coloring butter is founded on the\r\nfact that we are accustomed to form our judgment at once of the\r\nqualities of the article from the whiteness or the yellowness of its\r\ncolor. Whiter butter is less attractive generally than yellow summer or\r\ngrass-made butter. The color has come to be important to the seller, and\r\nartificial means are found to regulate it.\r\n\r\nThe coloring is made as follows: About a pound of butter is melted, so\r\nthat the heavier parts sink to the bottom, when the light, clear fat on\r\nthe top is poured into another dish. In this fat thus poured off is put\r\na piece of annatto about the size of a walnut, wrapped up in a linen\r\ncloth, and it is then again put over the fire. The coloring matter of\r\nthe annatto strains through the linen cloth, and turns the butter brown\r\nred, when it is allowed to cool off. When the butter is to be colored,\r\nsome of this brown red is melted, salted, and mixed very carefully into\r\nthe butter after washing. The quantity of coloring matter used depends\r\non the color which the maker wants to impart to his butter, and a little\r\npractice soon enables him to take the right quantity. Others pour the\r\ncoloring matter directly upon the butter to attain the same end.\r\n\r\nIn coloring artificially it is important to get a uniformity of color,\r\nwhich is the result of very thorough working. Colored butter must not be\r\nmarbled.\r\n\r\nThe cream is sometimes colored before churning. The annatto is put into\r\na clean beech-wood lye, and as much of this colored and strained lye is\r\ntaken as is necessary to produce the desired color in the butter. It is\r\nthen churned as usual.\r\n\r\nTurmeric is sometimes used instead of annatto for coloring butter. It\r\nhas no advantage, however, over annatto.\r\n\r\nIn many sections the butter is colored with an extract of saffron in\r\nwater, or of marigold, or with the juice of carrots, which is applied to\r\nthe cream before churning.\r\n\r\nThe coloring adds nothing to the quality or the taste. It is done for\r\nthe sake of the looks; but it gives the butter a deceptive appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE BUTTER-MILK.--The butter-milk in the churn is poured into a\r\ngreat cask, which in large dairies, as a general rule, is painted blue\r\noutside and white inside, with broad black iron hoops. It stands\r\ngenerally in the kitchen covered with a wooden lid. Butter-milk is used\r\neither in cooking, or for calves or swine, or is sold.\r\n\r\nDairymen in the vicinity of large cities have barrels with broad, bright\r\nbrass hoops, in which they carry their butter-milk to market. It is put\r\ninto them through a bung-hole, and when full the wooden bung is wound\r\nwith linen and driven in. In these barrels the butter-milk is carried to\r\nAmsterdam, Rotterdam, etc., sometimes by boats on the canals, sometimes\r\non wagons, and by yokes, and there sold to the grocers at wholesale, to\r\nbe again sold out by them. The butter-milk thus brings an income by no\r\nmeans inconsiderable to well-managed dairies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DUTCH CHEESE.--From time\r\nimmemorial, cheese, as an article of commerce, which has had a large\r\nsale, has brought an extensive income to the cattle-breeders and\r\ndairymen where its manufacture has been largely carried on, as\r\neverywhere in West Friesland, North and South Holland, and along the\r\nborders of the crooked Rhine in Utrecht.\r\n\r\nDairymen are not the only ones who enjoy the advantage which grows out\r\nof the cheese-trade; but a large number of other people derive\r\nconsiderable profit from it, and support themselves entirely by it. Even\r\nthe commonalty of the cities, where the weekly markets for the sale of\r\ncheese are regularly held, derive a considerable revenue from the small\r\ntaxes for carriage and market-dues, to which every seller has to submit.\r\n\r\nThe actual difference between the different kinds of cheese made in\r\nHolland is due in part to the form and size, and in part to the mode of\r\nmaking. Every sort has also a name derived from its peculiarities, or\r\nfrom the provinces or sections where it is made. The varieties of cheese\r\nbest known in the markets in South Holland are the spice cheese, the\r\nsweet milk cheese, known also under the name of Gouda cheese, the\r\nso-called May cheese, the Council’s cheese, the Jews’ cheese, and the\r\nEnglish cheese, made in many places.\r\n\r\nFurther up in North Holland, the North Dutch sweet milk cheese, as it is\r\ncommonly called in the province, known in the foreign markets as Edam\r\ncheese, is almost exclusively made. A kind of sweet milk cheese is made\r\nto a limited extent, called Commissions’ cheese. In West Friesland,\r\nUtrecht, and South Holland, but few except sweet milk cheeses are made.\r\n\r\nIn making cheese, the utmost cleanliness is most carefully observed in\r\nall the operations. Whoever is intrusted with this work is required to\r\ndisplay the utmost neatness in his whole person, as well as in the\r\ndairy-room; and the vats and other utensils are daily scoured, washed\r\nwith lye, and washed out in water and rinsed. The greatest attention is\r\nalso paid to the transport of cheese to the weekly markets in the\r\ncities; and in whatever way his load is carried, whether by wagon or in\r\nlittle boats, the person intrusted with it is always dressed in the\r\nso-called cheese-frock, a large white linen, which is used exclusively\r\nfor this purpose. At the market itself the cheese is laid on a\r\nfour-cornered bench, two feet high, and exposed to view in a glittering\r\nwhite linen cloth. But, in order to keep off all dust and impurities, a\r\nsail-cloth is raised over the whole, called the cheese-sail; or it is\r\ncovered with a sail-cloth covering, or sometimes with clean straw. But\r\nin other places it is customary to carry the cheese on wagons, in a\r\nwhite linen cloth, and covered with a woollen cover, ready packed for\r\nsale at the markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE-MAKING IN SOUTH HOLLAND.--Spice cheese from skim-milk, and sweet\r\nmilk or Gouda cheese, are the only kinds made to any extent in South\r\nHolland. Spice cheese, which derived its name from the addition of\r\nspices, is a firm, flat cheese, of about twenty pounds weight, brought\r\nto market generally colored red. It is three quarters of a foot thick,\r\nand one and a half feet in diameter, and is made as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.]\r\n\r\nThe skim-milk is poured from the milk-pans into large tubs, and allowed\r\nto stand quiet till the cheesy matter has settled to the bottom, which\r\nrequires, perhaps, half a day. Then the thin liquid on top is poured off\r\nvery carefully, without stirring up the rest, through a strainer, into a\r\nlarge brass kettle, till it is full; but the thicker substance at the\r\nbottom is left, and not put into the kettle. Under this kettle a fire is\r\nmade, and the milk heated to a certain degree, regulated by the judgment\r\nof the dairymaid, sufficient to warm other cold milk, but it must not\r\nboil. The fire is made in the kitchen, or in the summer-house, or in\r\nsome other room called the cheese-house. When the milk in the kettle is\r\nproperly heated, it is poured into the tub of milk which has been heated\r\nand allowed to get cold. This tub is an upright vat, open at the top, of\r\nuniform diameter, bound with wooden hoops, and generally left of the\r\nnatural color of the wood; scoured very bright, but sometimes painted\r\nblue and the hoops black. It is seen in Fig. 120.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of milk is large, the dairyman puts in as much rennet\r\nas he thinks necessary to curdle the milk completely; but before and\r\nduring the addition of the curd the whole is thoroughly stirred, and\r\nthis stirring is continued until the stick or wooden ladle used for the\r\npurpose will stand erect in the curd. Then the dairy-woman works the\r\ncurd with her hands till no further effect of the rennet in curding the\r\nmilk is to be seen. It is called the cheese-curd.\r\n\r\nThe rennet is prepared in the following manner: The maw or fourth\r\nstomach of a newly-killed sucking calf is taken from the other stomachs,\r\ncarefully cleaned and cut into strips two inches wide, and then hung up\r\nin the chimney to be smoked and dried; or, in hot weather in summer, it\r\nis hung up in the sun. Well smoked and dried strips will keep a very\r\nlong time. When these are wanted for use, they are very carefully washed\r\nand purified, and then laid in the salt brine from the butter-barrels,\r\nor in lukewarm salt water to soak. The liquid is put into bottles and\r\nlaid in the cellar. For curding milk as much is taken as is thought to\r\nbe necessary, which cannot be determined without considerable practice\r\nand experience. If too little is taken, the cheese is not fat enough; if\r\nmore than the right quantity, it gives a disgusting acid taste. It is\r\ndifficult, almost impossible, to state exactly how much rennet should be\r\nused with a certain quantity of milk, because this must be determined\r\nby its quality and its strength. Something like the following quantity\r\nis, however, taken: In a sixty-quart vat are placed about fifty rennets,\r\nprepared by drying, washing, and cutting, and a clear salt brine or\r\nbutter-pickle of twenty to twenty-five degrees strength is added. In\r\nsmaller quantities the proportion of rennet is about one and a half\r\nquarts to a rennet, or even less. This dried maw can be bought\r\neverywhere in packages of twenty-five pieces each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.]\r\n\r\nOne great point in cheese-making is to have a sufficient quantity of\r\ngood rennet in store; for the older it grows the more powerful and\r\neffective it becomes, and the experienced cheese-makers, studying their\r\nown interests, know very well how difficult, hurtful, and time-wasting,\r\nit is to use fresh or new rennet. The assertion sometimes made that they\r\nuse muriatic acid instead of rennet for curding the milk in Holland\r\nrests on an error, at least so far as the present methods are concerned.\r\nIn earlier times, and for the poorest kinds, as the Jews’ cheese,\r\nmuriatic acid was more or less used. At the present time, the rennet for\r\nthose cheeses is prepared from the stomachs of calves some days old.\r\n\r\nWhen the curd has sufficiently come, and has all been thoroughly broken,\r\nthe dairy-woman puts a four-cornered linen cloth, called the\r\ncheese-cloth, which is used only for this purpose, and is only loosely\r\nwoven, upon a small strong ladder laid over the edges of a low tub, and\r\nputs upon the cloth the proper quantity of curd, then ties up the four\r\ncorners of the cloth, and presses with her whole strength, that the milk\r\nmay drain off. This work is also done by men who can apply great\r\nstrength, Fig. 121. The corners of the cheese-cloth are brought\r\ntogether, and the operator presses as hard as he can, in order to remove\r\nall the milk from the curd. But, as this is not possible with the hands\r\nalone, the whole is placed under a plank-press, and by this means as\r\nmuch of the milk as possible is pressed out. A strong cleat is nailed to\r\na pillar in the wall at a convenient height from the floor,--say two\r\nfeet,--so that the tub, ladder, and cheese-cloth, can be put under the\r\nplank, when the plank is pressed down upon the cloth and curd. At the\r\nother end of the plank the operator sits and presses down with the whole\r\nweight of his body, as seen in Fig. 122. The whey runs into the tub, and\r\nis generally used as food for swine. The pressure is continued till no\r\nmore runs off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.]\r\n\r\nAfter the complete removal of the whey, the curd remaining in the cloth\r\nhas the form of the palms of the hands, and is pressed so firmly that it\r\nholds together when the cloth is removed. But it is again broken up, and\r\nput for this purpose into the breaking-tub, a low but broad, open tub,\r\nwith wooden hoops, and made of strong staves, and is here worked over by\r\nthe bare but cleanly-washed feet of the dairyman, or hired man. This\r\nworking with the feet is continued, just as in kneading dough, till all\r\nis brought to a stiff paste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.]\r\n\r\nWhen it has come to this consistence the forming of the cheese begins.\r\nThe dairyman has for this purpose a cheese-mould standing before him,\r\nand lays on the bottom a layer of cheese without spice, and this is\r\ncalled the blind layer. The cheese tub or mould, Figs. 123 and 124, is\r\nused only for this first moulding. It is a wooden vat, made of staves\r\nfrom one to one and a half inches thick, and is nine and a half to\r\ntwelve and a half inches in diameter, and about ten inches high, bound\r\nat the bottom and top with stout hoops. The bottom of oak-wood, put in\r\nvery carefully, is pierced with holes for letting off any moisture that\r\nmay remain in the cheese. On the top of the tub a cover is exactly\r\nfitted, to sink down upon the cheese when the pressure is applied. This\r\ncover is of oak, one and a half inches thick, and has a cross-piece\r\nthree and a half inches thick, which serves as a handle.\r\n\r\nThe first layer of cheese is quite firmly pressed down or trodden into\r\nthe mould with the hands or feet, and then follows a layer of curd mixed\r\nwith spices. The mixture is made best by putting as much of the pasty\r\ncurd from the vat into a tub as will form one layer in the mould. Over\r\nthis the spice is strewn, caraway and some pounded cloves, and the mass\r\nis then worked over, when it is placed as a new layer into the mould.\r\nUpon the second layer some coarsely-pounded cloves are generally\r\nscattered, or they are stuck whole over the surface. After that the\r\nsecond layer is pressed in like the first, and the third follows, and so\r\non till the mould is full. On the uppermost and firmly pressed layer is\r\nlaid the cover. The mould thus carefully filled is now brought under a\r\npress, which, partly on account of its length, is called the\r\n“long-press,” and sometimes the “first” or “cheese press,” because the\r\ncheese first comes under it. This press is seen in Fig. 125. It stands\r\non four short legs, and consists of upright beams fixed upon a platform,\r\nand a long beam, acting as a lever, with one end fastened by a rivet or\r\nbolt. The other end is loaded with weights to any desirable extent, as\r\nappears in the cut. The power of the press may also be increased or\r\ndiminished by shifting the end of the lever to the lower or upper hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125.]\r\n\r\nWhen the mould is put under the press it is set into a shallow,\r\nfour-cornered wooden box or pan on the foot-board. This pan is furnished\r\nwith grooves at the side, through which the whey can escape. The\r\npressure may still further be increased by putting a block on the lid of\r\nthe mould, as appears in the press. It is this powerful pressure which\r\ngives the cheese the high quality for which it is distinguished above\r\nothers. The whey still remaining in the curd runs off through the holes\r\nin the bottom of the mould, when the strong pressure is applied, into\r\nthe pan, and is caught in another pan which sits under the press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.]\r\n\r\nWhen the cheese has stood two hours under the press, it is taken from\r\nthe mould, surrounded by a clean linen cloth, and again brought under\r\nthe press. The change of cloth is repeated once or twice after two or\r\nthree hours’ pressing, and the cheese is left standing in the press over\r\nnight. The next morning the cheese is brought under another press, under\r\nwhich it is subjected to still more powerful pressure, and receives its\r\npeculiar form. This press is seen in Fig. 126, and consists of a frame\r\nresting on four strong uprights, forming a kind of firm table. On the\r\nplate of the table lie four or six rollers, whose ends at both sides\r\npass through holes in the standard pieces, and serve merely to assist in\r\ntaking out the cheese. The pressure is obtained by heavy weights let\r\ndown and raised by a kind of windlass fixed in two perpendicular\r\nstandards. The cheese as it comes under this press is not in the mould,\r\nbut is simply laid in a pan, as seen in Fig. 127. Before the pressure\r\nbegins, however, the stamp or mark of the manufacturer, a key, a letter,\r\netc., in iron, is laid upon the cheese, and upon that a square board.\r\nThe pan and weight are lowered, so that the pressure begins and the\r\nstamp is impressed on the cheese, which becomes flatter, smoother, and\r\nfirmer than before. The cheese is left under this press till it gets its\r\nfinal form, and the pressure in the pan is increased or diminished,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.]\r\n\r\nWhen the cheese, after being pressed in both machines, has received its\r\nfinal form, it is placed in a long trough, called the salt-trough, which\r\nis generally in the cow-room behind the cow-stands. It has been already\r\nsaid that the cow-stall is used as a cheese-room in summer, when the\r\ncows are out to pasture. In this trough, a space deep and wide enough\r\nfor the diameter of the cheese, from four to six cheeses can be laid. In\r\nthe salt-trough the cheeses are salted as long and as thoroughly as is\r\nnecessary. Observation and experience are needed here to get the right\r\nquantity of salt and the right time, that the cheese may receive a\r\nsuitably firm crust or rind.\r\n\r\nWhen the cheese in the salt-trough is sufficiently salted, it is put\r\nover a large tub, where it is properly washed in cold, fresh water,\r\ntrimmed with a cheese-knife, and colored. For coloring, annatto boiled\r\nin water with some potash is used. After the coloring the cheese is\r\nrubbed with the beistings, or first milk of a cow newly-calved. The\r\nspice cheese gets its red color and firm, smooth rind in the coloring\r\nand washing in the beistings; and this distinguishes it from other\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nThe colored cheeses are now laid upon shelves made for the purpose in\r\nthe cow-stall used as a cheese-room, and turned daily till properly\r\ndried. When dry they are laid for sale in a cheese or store room. This\r\nroom is connected with the house, or separated from the other rooms only\r\nby a thin board partition. This room, as well as the cow-stall, is kept\r\nextraordinarily clean,--scoured and aired, and used for nothing but the\r\nkeeping of cheese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.]\r\n\r\nFig. 128 represents the cow-stall used as a cheese-room, in which the\r\nsalt-trough is seen, and the dairyman and dairy-woman are occupied in\r\nturning and trimming the cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF SWEET MILK CHEESE IN SOUTH HOLLAND.--The best kind of\r\nsweet milk cheese is made in the vicinity of the city of Gouda, and on\r\nthe gray and Dutch Yssel, from which circumstance it is often known by\r\nthe name of Gouda cheese.\r\n\r\nThe making of this cheese is less difficult than that of spice cheese,\r\nbut requires more attention and care, because the rich sweet milk is\r\nused for it. It is as follows: The milk as it comes fresh from the cow\r\nis strained through a hair-strainer into a large wooden vat or tub, or,\r\nin some large dairies, into a copper kettle, which stands on a peculiar\r\ntray or bench. This tray is made of four to five inch posts, and its\r\nsize is governed by the quantity of milk of the tubs to be used; but\r\nthese tubs generally hold from one hundred to one hundred and fifty\r\ncans. The milk is immediately set with the requisite quantity of rennet,\r\nusually one quarter of a can to one hundred cans of milk; and if it does\r\nnot “come” in a quarter of an hour, more rennet is added.\r\n\r\nWhen it has properly curdled, it is stirred in all directions with a\r\nwooden ladle three or four times over, and somewhat broken up, when it\r\nis allowed to stand three or four minutes at rest. It is then gently and\r\nconstantly stirred again, with the ladle or the hands, and broken. By\r\ntoo active stirring one gets more whey than cheese, and very quick\r\nstirring must be avoided. The whey is then allowed to stand some time,\r\nby which the curdled cheese particles collect, and the whey appears on\r\nthe surface, and can be taken off and poured into a tub made for the\r\npurpose. To the mass still remaining in the kettle, which is now almost\r\nall cheesy matter, as much hot water is added as is sufficient to warm\r\nit properly. The addition of hot water must be made with discretion,\r\nhowever, and must not exceed a certain amount, which can be learned only\r\nby practice. The more we add, the drier will the cheese become after a\r\nwhile; and, though it may keep the better, and be better for\r\ntransportation, the taste is unquestionably injured by it. The cold-made\r\ncheese is far more liable to injury from keeping, but is much richer and\r\nmore palatable, on which account the best is generally eaten fresh. The\r\nquantity of hot water to be added for warming the milk must therefore he\r\ndetermined somewhat by the disposition to be made of the cheese.\r\n\r\nWhen the hot water has stood, say half an hour, on the curd, it is taken\r\noff and poured into the whey. The curd is now properly brought together\r\nby the hands or a ladle, and again thoroughly worked and broken. After\r\nstanding at rest a short time, the water and whey are turned off again,\r\nas completely as possible, in the whey-tub. The mass of curd still\r\nremaining in the vat, now called wrongel, is cut up into small pieces,\r\nwhich are very carefully worked over, and then pressed into the wooden\r\ncheese-mould. In order to get a very fine separation of the curd, only a\r\nsmall quantity is taken at once from the vat, which is rubbed in the\r\nhands, and then pressed into the mould till it is quite full. The\r\ncheese-mould is in the form of a bowl, made of willow wood, with its\r\nlower part pierced with holes, so that the whey can run off when the\r\npressure is applied. The cheese now formed is taken out carefully,\r\nrubbed with the hands, and still further worked in the cheese-tub, and\r\nagain very firmly pressed into the mould with the hands.\r\n\r\nTo be able to press it into the mould with greater power, an implement\r\ncalled the presser is used. It consists of a short stick, with a kind of\r\nhandle or cross-piece on the upper end. On the lower end a disc is fixed\r\nwhich fits into the cheese-mould. In using the instrument, the disc is\r\nplaced on the cheese to be pressed into the mould, the handle or\r\ncross-piece is placed against the chest or shoulders, and the operator\r\npresses down at the same time with his hands, thrusting the disc as\r\ndeeply as possible into the cheese-mould. When pressed enough on one\r\nside, it is turned round in the mould, bringing the other side up, and\r\nthe pressure is again applied as strongly as possible. For saving the\r\nwhey in cheese-pressing, the mould is set into a pan only a little\r\nlarger than the mould itself, which catches the whey running out from\r\nthe mould. When the cheese in the mould is properly pressed by hand, the\r\ncover is put upon the mould, which is loaded gradually, in order to\r\nbring down the greatest possible pressure. The weight or pressure is\r\ngreater or less according to the size of the cheese; yet during the\r\npressure the cheese must be frequently turned, that it may get the right\r\nform. The gradual increase of the pressure goes on for twenty-four\r\nhours, when the cheese is taken from the mould to be laid in a tub of\r\nsalt-brine in the cellar; the cellar must be kept cool. The cheese\r\nremains in the brine twenty-four hours, but is turned once in that time.\r\nIt is then taken out and put upon a table, the surface of which is\r\ninclined, the legs of one end being longer than those of the other. On\r\nboth sides of the inclined table run grooves in the direction of the\r\ninclination of the surface, which unite at the lower end, and serve as a\r\nway of escape for the brine or pickle into a tub below. Here the cheese\r\nis rubbed with salt, and a handful of salt, is scattered over the top,\r\nwhen it is left standing for some time “in the salt.” If one side was\r\nrubbed in the morning, it is turned at evening; and the other side is\r\nserved in the same manner as the first. A cheese of from fifteen to\r\nsixteen pounds remains standing thus four or five days, according to the\r\ntemperature. If the heat is great, it must stand the longer in the salt.\r\nWhen sufficiently salted, it is washed off in hot water, and taken to\r\nthe cheese-room, where it is daily turned on dry, clean shelves. If it\r\nis still greasy or dauby on the outside, it is still further washed in\r\nwater, and dried off with a coarse linen towel.\r\n\r\nThe cheese-room is generally kept closed by day to keep out the light\r\nand sun, which are not good for cheese. It is opened in the morning and\r\nevening to let in a little cooling air; yet a strong breeze is avoided\r\nby opening all the doors and windows at the same time, for the cheese\r\nwill crack and break open if exposed to it.\r\n\r\nSweet milk cheese is fit for use at the age of four weeks. Strongly\r\nsalted cheese does not ripen up so quickly as that which is salted less;\r\nbut, if it takes longer, the loss is less, and, on that account, it is\r\npreferred for sending off to less salted cheese, which, on the other\r\nhand, is richer, and has a little better taste. In the daily turning of\r\nthe cheese, great care is taken to observe any little specks in it where\r\nthe mites conceal themselves. As soon as such places are discovered, a\r\nhole is dug out with a knife as deep as they extend into the cheese. The\r\nholes are left open till the next day, when, if no more mites appear,\r\nthey are stopped up with other cheese. But, if they still appear, some\r\npounded pepper is put into the holes, which destroys them. Rotten or\r\nmoist spots on the cheese are treated in the same way, but very deep\r\nholes have to be made into the cheese, and it is best to cover them with\r\nbuckwheat-meal, when they dry up very quickly.\r\n\r\nIn very hot weather it sometimes happens that the cheese swells up and\r\nbegins to ferment. Then it is laid on the cleanly-scoured pavement of\r\nthe cheese-room, where it is cooler; or, as many do, pierced pretty\r\ndeeply with holes with a knitting-needle, which often helps it. With the\r\ndecrease of the great heat of the sun, the swelling also ceases. The\r\ncheese is not injured except in appearance, the taste being improved.\r\nBut, if the swelling is very considerable, it makes the cheese hollow.\r\nIf the milk and cheese dishes are not very cleanly washed and rinsed\r\nout, the cheese gets a wrinkled crust, and begins to ferment.\r\n\r\nSweet milk cheese, three or four months old, is turned and aired only\r\nonce a week in dry weather. Many cheese-makers also sprinkle the cheeses\r\ndaily, for a week or two after they are fourteen days old, with beer and\r\nvinegar, or with vinegar in which saffron has been extracted, by which\r\nit gets not only a beautiful yellow color, but is also protected from\r\nflies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF THE WHEY OF SWEET MILK CHEESE.--On what remains of the milk\r\ndevoted to the making of sweet milk cheese in the manner above\r\ndescribed, or the whey which runs off in the pressing of the cheese,\r\nthere forms, after it has stood a few days, a fine creamy skin, which is\r\ncarefully taken off with a wooden spoon, put in a clean jar, and stirred\r\nfrom time to time. This cream is collected to make butter, and it can be\r\ndone once a week. This butter-whey is healthful and good, to be sure;\r\nbut, on the whole, is not so fine and delicate flavored as good cream\r\nbutter, and on this account is cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe butter-milk which comes from the churning of the cream of whey is a\r\ngood food for swine. They greatly relish it.\r\n\r\nWhey is also sold as a beverage, and is called “sweet whey.” When fresh\r\nand untainted, it is quite an agreeable drink, very cooling, and good\r\nfor the health in spring, purifying the blood, though somewhat purgative\r\nin its effect on the kidneys. Later in summer, when the heat is very\r\ngreat, whey is thought to be rather injurious to the health than\r\notherwise. It is then used exclusively for swine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY CHEESE.--In the early part of summer, when the grass is best, sweet\r\nmilk cheese is made in precisely the same way as that described, yet of\r\nsmaller size and less weight. This is called May cheese, and is designed\r\nfor immediate use or sale when ripe, as it will not keep, and easily\r\nloses its fine flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWS’ CHEESE.--Another kind of sweet milk cheese is the Jews’ cheese. It\r\ndiffers from common sweet milk cheese in its form, which is flatter and\r\nthinner, and partly in being less salted, and of a much looser texture.\r\nIt is but little made; but some dairies are devoted to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL’S CHEESE.--This is made as the common sweet milk cheese, only in\r\nmuch smaller moulds. It has also a peculiar color. It is allowed to get\r\nrather old before it is relished, and is then mostly given away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MILK’S CHEESE.--This is made in winter, when the cows are in the\r\nstall. It is not so good as grass cheese, which is made in summer, when\r\nthe cows are at pasture, and is less relished, and brings a lower price.\r\nWhen the cows are brought to the barn late in the fall, it can be made\r\nof very good quality for a few days; but the longer the cow remains in\r\nthe stall the more the milk loses its good quality for cheese, on which\r\naccount but few of the larger dairies make cheese at all in winter.\r\n\r\nTo make it appear to buyers more like grass-made cheese, and to be able\r\nto sell it, it is colored with the same material, and it is then often\r\nvery difficult to distinguish it, since great pains is taken to give the\r\ntwo kinds the same form, hardness of rind, etc. The dairymen have less\r\nto do with this deception than the dealers. Hay cheese is rather better\r\nin quality for coloring, since it gains in appearance and taste; but it\r\nnever can equal grass-made cheese in fine qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE-MAKING IN NORTH HOLLAND.--In the province of North Holland sweet\r\nmilk cheese is made almost exclusively. From ancient times this\r\nparticular branch of farming has been carried to great extent; but it\r\nhas especially grown in importance since the province gained a firm soil\r\nby artificial draining. At the present time North Holland is the\r\nhead-quarters of the cheese-trade; and it is easily explained in the\r\nfact that no other province has more or better cattle. The manufacture\r\nof cheese is almost the only object of keeping cattle, and the North\r\nDutch dairy farmer applies himself with the greatest possible zeal to\r\nthe most careful modes of cheese-making, in order to keep up the ancient\r\nreputation of his cheeses, both in the domestic and foreign markets, and\r\nto secure to himself all of the advantages springing from it.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of cheese which is weekly sold in the markets of Alkmaar,\r\nHoorn, Edam, Purmerend, Medenblik, Enkhuizen, etc., is enormous. We cite\r\nAlkmaar alone as an example, where on the city scales there were weighed\r\nno less than 23,859,258 Netherlandish pounds (536,834,830 pounds,\r\nAmerican), from 1758 to 1830. Since that time the manufacture has\r\nincreased, so that from three to four million Netherland pounds are\r\nannually brought to the Alkmaar market. But, besides this, a large\r\nquantity of cheese does not come into the market, but is sold at the\r\ndairy without passing through the hands of the traders, and never comes\r\nto the city scales.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 there were sold in the North Dutch cheese-markets 22,385,812\r\npounds, to say nothing of the large quantity sold directly from the\r\ndairy. It is easy to see, therefore, how important and extensive an\r\ninterest the manufacture of cheese has become for this province. Of the\r\ntwenty-two million pounds annually exported, the value may be estimated\r\nas at least three million Dutch guilders. The price and value of the\r\ncheese vary, of course, with the markets.\r\n\r\nThe North Dutch cheese differs somewhat in quality and money value,\r\naccording to the section where it is made; but in general that made in\r\nthe region about Hoorn is considered the best, as is very natural, since\r\nin that vicinity are to be found the finest meadows and pastures in the\r\nprovince. The villages of Oosterblokker, Westerwoude, Hoogecarspel, and\r\nTwisk, are distinguished above all others; and so are the pastures of\r\nBeemster, Purmer, and Schermer, almost equally so.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch cheese-maker reckons twelve Netherland cans of milk to a\r\npound--two and a quarter pounds American--of cheese, according to which\r\na cow in three hundred days would give from eighteen hundred to two\r\nthousand cans of milk, or usually from one hundred and fifty to one\r\nhundred and seventy-five Netherland pounds of cheese, in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UTENSILS USED IN CHEESE-MAKING IN NORTH HOLLAND are nearly the same\r\nas those already described for saving the milk for butter, and those\r\nused in the various processes of cheese-making in South Holland. They\r\nare modified to some extent, to be sure, by the taste, the pride, the\r\nwealth, or the caprice, of each dairyman. Many a them are painted,\r\nwholly or in part, in oil colors, for the sake of durability as well as\r\ncleanliness, on which the North Dutch dairyman lays great stress. They\r\ndo not require much capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF NORTH DUTCH CHEESES, AND THE TRADE IN THEM.--The North Dutch\r\ncheese is called sweet milk cheese, and also, pretty commonly, white\r\ncheese, where it is made; but in Germany it is called Edamer, less\r\nbecause the best is made in the vicinity of this city than because the\r\nlargest trade in it is carried on there.\r\n\r\nAll sweet milk cheese has not the same weight, form, and size. Many\r\nkinds of it come into the market under different names; as, for example,\r\nlarge cheese of 20 to 24 pounds (45 to 54 pounds), Malbollen of 16\r\npounds (36 pounds), medium of 10 to 12 pounds (22 to 27 pounds),\r\nCommission’s of 6 or 7 pounds (14 to 16 pounds), and little ones of 4\r\npounds (9 pounds), to which belong the Jews’ cheese. Besides this, the\r\nmaking of English cheese is carried on. Malbollen is but little made. It\r\nis of about twenty pounds weight. Fifty years ago large quantities of it\r\ncame into market, and were sold mostly in North Brabant and the Rhine\r\nprovinces. Of the medium cheese the manufacture is pretty extensive at\r\nthe present time, and it is sold to go to North Brabant chiefly. The\r\nprice of these sorts is more frequently fluctuating than that of the\r\nsmaller ones; but less so than that of Commission’s cheese, which is not\r\nmuch made. These varieties in former years were very profitable, since\r\nthey were made with little labor, being light and spongy from slight\r\npressing and little salting, and were sold green.\r\n\r\nDairy industry is now chiefly devoted to making the varieties most known\r\nand sought for in Germany, the Edam small sweet milk cheeses, which are\r\nsent in enormous quantities to all parts of the world. There are two\r\nvarieties of Edam cheese in the market, one with a white, the other with\r\na red rind. The latter is firm, more of a yellowish color inside, and\r\ncolored outside. The coloring matter is prepared in France for this\r\nspecial purpose. By this treatment the cheese is better adapted to\r\ntransportation. The early red rind cheese is the finest and best. It is\r\nmade in spring from milk fresh and warm from cows just turned to\r\npasture, and is exported mostly to Italy, Spain, and America. That made\r\nlater in summer is not so good, and goes to France; the red rind, made\r\nstill later in the fall, goes to England and Brabant. Cheese that is\r\ninjured, or does not keep well, is sold mostly in Hamburg and Brabant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING OF EDAM CHEESE.--The Edam is a rich sweet milk cheese, that is\r\nmade from fresh, unskimmed milk. The milk, while still warm from the\r\ncow, is poured into a large tub or a kettle through the strainer. In\r\ncold weather, when it has cooled off in standing in the air, it is\r\nwarmed to a proper degree by adding milk heated by the fire. The rennet\r\nis then added. This is prepared in the following manner: The maw of the\r\nnursing-calf, cut, into long strips, is soaked for twenty-four hours in\r\nsweet whey, when it is made lukewarm over a slow fire, whey and all, and\r\nthree times the quantity of cheese-brine, or solution of the salt of the\r\ncheese, added. The mass is then allowed to stand four days, when it is\r\nfit for use. An exact determination of the quantity of rennet to be used\r\ncannot well be given, since the quantity depends on the quality; but\r\nusually about two hundred cans of milk to one fifth of a can of rennet\r\nis the proportion, taking more or less, according to the strength of the\r\nrennet.\r\n\r\nThe milk in the tub to which the rennet has been added is covered over\r\nand allowed to stand till it is curdled, or become hard, which usually\r\nrequires a quarter of an hour. The curdled milk is then called “glib.”\r\nIt is now slowly but regularly stirred, with a shallow, long-handled\r\ncheese-spoon, in all directions.\r\n\r\nSome cheese-makers treat the milk in the following manner: They stir the\r\nmilk, thrusting an inverted cheese-ladle into the curdling mass every\r\ntwo or three minutes after adding the rennet, by which the curdling is\r\nmuch hastened. Now they move the ladle or cheese-stick three or four\r\ntimes with considerable force through the thickening milk, and lay it,\r\ninverted, on the surface of the milk, covering the vat for ten or twelve\r\nminutes, when the mass is again set in motion, and then again allowed to\r\nstand. By this means the cheese particles settle to the bottom, and the\r\nwhey rises to the top.\r\n\r\nWhen, after these alternate stirrings and rest of the curdling milk, the\r\nsolid particles have settled, and the whey is collected on top, the\r\nlatter is turned off, as carefully as possible, into the whey-tub. In\r\norder the better to settle the cheesy parts, and to cause the whey to\r\ncome up, the cheese-stick is loaded with weights or stones, by which the\r\nwhey is separated in the pressure upon the curd. Some minutes after, the\r\nwhey is again turned off, the whole mass is properly stirred, and the\r\ncurd is collected with the cheese-stick and worked with the hands, and\r\nthe whey is again carefully turned off. The curd, now become thick, is\r\ntaken out of the vat, piece by piece, and broken with the hands as\r\nfinely as possible, in order to fill as much into the cheese-moulds as\r\nwill just make a cheese. The moulds are set into the cheese-vat, and the\r\ncurd is worked and pressed closely in with the hand, to remove the whey\r\nas much as possible. The cheese is then taken out of the mould, and\r\nagain very finely crumbled in the vat, and, after the whey is again\r\nturned off through the strainer, is pressed the second time into the\r\nmould, so that it is as full of cheese as it can possibly be. It is then\r\nturned in the mould so that the upper side goes down, when it is again\r\nfirmly pressed in. The turning is repeated several times.\r\n\r\nIn the making of large and medium cheeses the presser is used, while\r\nspace left empty by the pressure is again filled with curd, so that the\r\nmould is always full, and the cheese gets its requisite size. In the\r\nsmaller or four-pound cheeses, the hands alone are used for this\r\npressing into the mould. The mould, now pressed full, is put into a tub,\r\nproperly washed in whey, and cleansed of all remaining fat. By the\r\nwashing and smoothing the cheese must get a glossy and smooth rind.\r\nAfter this is done, the cheese is again taken out of the mould, wrapped\r\nin a clean linen cloth, put in again, and covered over and brought under\r\nthe press, that it may become harder and firmer, and that the whey may\r\nrun off.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather the cheese is left under the press five hours, from nine\r\nin the morning till two in the afternoon; but, if it is cool, it must\r\nstand longer. There are several different objects in view in deciding\r\nthe continuance of the pressure. Many think two or three hours\r\nsufficient, whilst others press five hours. Cheese designed for export\r\nis pressed longer, or twelve hours.\r\n\r\nIt takes from three to four hours, usually, from the pouring in of the\r\nmilk to the bringing of the cheese under the press; but it can be done\r\nin two or two and a half hours without injuring the cheese.\r\n\r\nAfter the first pressing is finished, the cheese is put into another\r\nmould, rounder than the first, and with only one hole in the bottom, to\r\nlie in the salt. In many places a long trough is used, in which several\r\nsuch moulds are placed to be salted at the same time; and for this\r\neither dry salt or pickle (brine, or salt in solution) is used. The\r\npickle is most commonly used, and is thought best. When one side of the\r\ncheese has laid some hours in the brine, it is turned, and the other\r\nside is also salted. After a while it is salted or turned in the brine\r\nbut once a day. Small four-pound cheeses remain nine days in hot\r\nweather, and in cold ten or twelve days, in the salt; medium ones of ten\r\nto twelve pounds must lie at least three weeks. In very hot weather they\r\nare often salted twice a day. The moulds with the salted cheese are\r\nplaced, several together, into the cheese-vat where the brine is, or on\r\na salting-tray where the brine is collected in a tub beneath. After\r\nbeing finally salted, they are washed perfectly clean with water or warm\r\nwhey. Many put their cheeses from the brine immediately in a kettle of\r\nhot whey for some minutes, and wash them in it. All unevenness or\r\nroughness got in pressing in the mould is now scraped off with a knife.\r\n\r\nAfter the washing, the cheeses are again perfectly dried, and laid on\r\nthe shelves in the cheese-room, where they are daily turned, and remain\r\nfrom two to four, and even five weeks. The cheese is now salable; but\r\nbefore it is packed or delivered it is laid for some hours to soak in\r\npure, cold spring or well water, the smallest for three hours, the\r\nmedium four, and the largest five hours. The cheese is then well cleaned\r\nwith the cheese-brush, laid on the shelf in the store-room, and turned a\r\nweek or more, daily. But, in order to give them a fine yellow color, in\r\ndamp weather, especially, the poorer ones are, by many dairymen, laid a\r\ngood ways apart, and sprinkled or washed daily with new beer. When the\r\ncheese is to be sold, it is properly washed still again in hot whey, and\r\nrubbed with a woolen cloth a day before sending to market, with hot or\r\ncold linseed-oil, by which the outside of the cheese gets a fine glow;\r\nbut it must be rubbed till no fat or oil is to be felt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED COLOR OF EDAM CHEESE.--After the dairyman has sold his cheese to\r\nthe merchant, it is colored by him quite red. It will not be\r\nuninteresting to many readers to know some of the details of this\r\npeculiar color.\r\n\r\nEdam cheese is colored with what is called tournesol, which is extracted\r\nfrom a plant (_Croton tinctorium_). This is an annual, which grows wild\r\nin France, in great abundance, in the vicinity of Montpelier, in\r\nLanguedoc; and around Aix, in Provence, large commons are sown with it.\r\nThe seed is sown in March and April. From a white and straight tap root,\r\nit sends up a stalk something like six inches high, which divides into\r\nmany branches. The leaves have very long stems, of a pale green color.\r\nThe flower-stalks spring up from between the branches, and bear flowers\r\nin fan-shaped clusters. The vegetation of the plant continues four\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the tournesol is as follows: The plants are collected\r\nlate in summer, the roots thrown away, and the other parts taken to a\r\nmill, where they are ground, and the juice pressed out. Into this juice\r\nthe rags of old hempen cloth are dipped till they are soaked full, when\r\nthey are hung up to dry in the sun. When they are dry they are laid on a\r\ntray over a tub filled with urine, in which carbonate of lime has been\r\ndissolved, so that the edges hang over the rim of the tub on which they\r\nrest. The vapor from the solution of lime must penetrate the rags, and\r\nthis gives them a violet color, when they are taken off and dried again,\r\nto be replaced till they are fully colored.\r\n\r\nThe tournesol rags have become an article of commerce, for which France\r\nreceives annually from Holland from 100,000 to 200,000 guilders (from\r\n$38,000 to $76,000).\r\n\r\nTo give the Edam cheeses the red rind, they are rubbed with these\r\ntournesol rags, from which they got the dark violet color; and after\r\nthey are dried they are again rubbed, which gives them a glowing red.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent peculiarity of the tournesol rags that they not only\r\nimpart the color to Edam cheese, to which people abroad are so\r\naccustomed, but that they keep the insects from the cheese, whilst the\r\ncoloring matter does not penetrate inside, but remains on the rind.\r\nSubstitutes for it have been repeatedly sought, but not found; nor have\r\nthe attempts made to grow the plant in Holland proved successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE WHEY OF THE NORTH DUTCH SWEET MILK CHEESE.--The whey obtained\r\nin making cheese in North Holland is collected in large tubs. The sweet,\r\nagreeable taste of the whey is soon lost when it is set to obtain the\r\nfatty particles still remaining in it. The cream which forms on it is\r\ndaily taken off with a skimmer, put into a cream-pot, and when it is\r\ncollected in sufficient quantity it is made into whey butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A DAIRY-WOMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier chapters of this work I have spoken to farmers and\r\ndairymen of the selection, care, and management, of dairy stock. The\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth chapters relate more especially to your\r\ndepartment, and on your application and skill will depend chiefly the\r\nsuccessful result of the dairy establishment. Of what avail are costly\r\nbarns, well-selected cows, and judicious feeding, in the butter and\r\ncheese dairy, if the products are to be depreciated in value by the\r\nimperfect modes of preparing them for the market, where the final\r\njudgment is passed upon them, and where it is expected the price will be\r\naccording to their value?\r\n\r\nYou have, doubtless, had a much greater practical knowledge and\r\nexperience of the details of dairy management than I have. For this\r\npractice and experience I have the utmost respect; but I have not spoken\r\nwithout a knowledge of the subject. I have made many a cheese, and many\r\na pound of butter, while my observations have extended over all the most\r\nimportant dairy districts of the country, and have not been limited to\r\nthe practices of any one section, which, however good in themselves, may\r\nnot be the best. I trust, therefore, you will excuse me for calling your\r\nattention to the more important points to which I have alluded; and, if\r\nmy conclusions happen to differ from your own, in any respect, that you\r\nwill not discard them as worthless, without first bringing them to the\r\ntest of careful experiment, when I trust they will be found correct.\r\n\r\nI have not written to establish any favorite theory, but simply to\r\ninculcate truth, and to aid in developing a most important branch of\r\nAmerican industry, which, either directly or indirectly, involves the\r\ninvestment of a vast amount of capital, the aggregate profits of which\r\ndepend so largely on your judgment and skill.\r\n\r\nI need not remind you that any addition, however small, to the market\r\nvalue of each pound of butter or cheese, will largely increase the\r\nannual income of your establishment. Nor need I remind you that these\r\narticles are generally the last of either the luxuries or the\r\nnecessaries of life in which city customers are willing to economize.\r\nThey must and will have a good article, and are ready to pay for it in\r\nproportion to its goodness; or, if they desire to economize in butter,\r\nit will be in the quantity rather than the quality.\r\n\r\nPoor butter is a drug in the market. Nobody wants it, and the dealer\r\noften finds it difficult to get it off his hands, when a delicate and\r\nfinely-flavored article attracts attention and secures a ready sale.\r\nSome say that poor butter will do for cooking. But a good steak or\r\nmutton-chop is too expensive to allow any one to spoil it by the use of\r\na poor quality of butter; and good pastry-cooks will tell you that cakes\r\nand pies cannot be made without good sweet butter, and plenty of it.\r\nThese dishes relish too well, when properly cooked with nice butter, for\r\nany one to tolerate the use of poor butter in them.\r\n\r\nOn page 220 and elsewhere, I have dwelt on the necessity of extreme\r\ncleanliness in all the operations of the dairy; and this is the basis\r\nand fundamental principle of your business. I would not suppose, for a\r\nmoment, that you are lacking in this respect. The enormous quantities\r\nof disgusting, streaky, and tallow-like butter that are daily thrust\r\nupon the seaboard markets must be due to the carelessness and negligence\r\nof heedless men, to exposure to sun and rain, to bad packing, and to\r\ndelays in transportation. Many of these evils you may not be able to\r\nremove, since you cannot follow the article to the market, and see that\r\nit arrives safely and untainted. But you can take greater pains,\r\nperhaps, in some of the preliminary processes of making, and produce an\r\narticle that will not be so liable to injure from keeping and\r\ntransportation; and then, if fault is to be found, it does not rest with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI will not suggest the possibility that your ideas of cleanliness and\r\nneatness may be at fault; and that what may seem an excess of nicety and\r\nscrubbing to you may appear to be almost slovenliness to some others,\r\nwhose butter receives the highest price in the market, and always finds\r\nthe readiest sale. Permit me, however, to refer you to pages 300, 324,\r\nand 325, where a detailed account is given of the washings in water and\r\nwashings in alkali; of the scrubbings, and the scourings, and the\r\nscaldings, and the rinsings, which the neat and tidy Dutch dairy-women\r\ngive all the utensils of the dairy, from the pails to the firkins and\r\nthe casks, and also to their extreme carefulness that no infectious odor\r\nrises from the surroundings. I think you will see that it is a physical\r\nimpossibility that any taint can affect the atmosphere or the utensils\r\nof such a dairy, and that many of the details of their practice may be\r\nworthy of imitation in our American dairies.\r\n\r\nAnd here allow me to suggest that, though we may not approve of the\r\ngeneral management in any particular section, or any particular dairy,\r\nit is rare that there is not something in the practice of that section\r\nthat is really valuable and worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nOn pages 231 and 234 I have called your attention to the use of the\r\nsponge and clean cloth for absorbing and removing the butter-milk in the\r\nmost thorough manner; this I regard as of great importance.\r\n\r\nI have stated on page 234 that, under ordinarily favorable\r\ncircumstances, from twelve to eighteen hours will be sufficient to raise\r\nthe cream; and that I do not believe it should stand over twenty-four\r\nhours under any circumstances. This, I am aware, is very different from\r\nthe general practice over the country. But, if you will make the\r\nexperiment in the most careful manner, setting the pans in a good, airy\r\nplace, and not upon the cellar bottom, I think you will soon agree with\r\nme that all you get, after twelve or eighteen hours, under the best\r\ncircumstances, or at most after twenty-four hours, will detract from the\r\nquality and injure the fine and delicate aroma and agreeable taste of\r\nthe butter to a greater extent than you are aware of. The cream which\r\nrises from milk set on the cellar bottom acquires an acrid taste, and\r\ncan neither produce butter of so fine a quality or so agreeable to the\r\npalate as that which rises from milk set on shelves from six to eight\r\nfeet high, around which there is a full and free circulation of pure\r\nair. The latter is sweeter, and appears in much larger quantities in the\r\nsame time than the former.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, you devote your attention to the making of butter to sell\r\nfresh in the market, and desire to obtain a reputation which shall aid\r\nand secure the quickest sale and the highest price, you will use cream\r\nthat rises first, and that does not stand too long on the milk. You will\r\nchurn it properly and patiently, and not with too great haste. You will\r\nwork it so thoroughly and completely with the butter-worker, and the\r\nsponge and cloth, as to remove every particle of butter-milk, never\r\nallowing your own or any other hands to touch it. You will keep it at a\r\nproper temperature when making, and after it is made, by the judicious\r\nuse of ice, and avoid exposing it to the bad odors of a musty cellar.\r\nYou will discard the use of artificial coloring or flavoring matter, and\r\ntake the utmost care in every process of making. You will stamp your\r\nbutter tastefully with some mould which can be recognized in the market\r\nas yours; as, for instance, your initials, or some form or figure which\r\nwill most please the eye and the taste of the customer. You will send it\r\nin boxes so perfectly prepared and cleansed as to impart no taste of\r\nwood to the butter. If all these things receive due attention, my word\r\nfor it, the initials or form which you adopt will be inquired after, and\r\nyou will always find a ready and a willing purchaser at the highest\r\nmarket price.\r\n\r\nBut, if you are differently situated, and it becomes necessary to pack\r\nand sell as firkin-butter, let me suggest the necessity of an equal\r\ndegree of nicety and care in preparation, and that you insist, as one of\r\nyour rights, that the article be packed in the best of oak-wood firkins,\r\nthoroughly prepared after the manner of the Dutch, as stated on page\r\n325. A greater attention to these points would make the butter thus\r\npacked worth several cents a pound more when it arrives in the market\r\nthan it ordinarily is. Indeed, the manner in which it not infrequently\r\ncomes to market is a disgrace to those who packed it; and it cannot be\r\nthat such specimens were ever put up by the hands of a dairy-woman. I\r\nhave often seen what was bought for butter open so marbled, streaked,\r\nand rancid, that it was scarcely fit to use on the wheels of a carriage.\r\n\r\nIf you adopt the course which I have recommended in regard to skimming,\r\nyou will have a large quantity of sweet skimmed milk, far better than it\r\nwould be if allowed to stand thirty-six or forty-eight hours, as is the\r\ncustom with many. This is too valuable to waste, and it is my opinion\r\nthat you can use it to far greater profit than to allow it to be fed to\r\nswine. There can be no question, I think, that cheese-making should be\r\ncarried on at the same time with the making of butter, in small and\r\nmedium-sized dairies. You have seen, in Chapter XI., that some of the\r\nbest cheese of Holland is made of sweet skim-milk. The reputation of\r\nParmesan--a skim-milk cheese of Italy, page 266--is world-wide, and it\r\ncommands a high price and ready sale. The mode of making these varieties\r\nhas been described in detail in the ninth and eleventh chapters; and you\r\ncan imitate them, or, perhaps, improve upon them, and thus turn the\r\nskim-milk to a very profitable account, if it is sweet and good. You\r\nwill find, if you adopt this system, that your butter will be improved,\r\nand that, without any great amount of extra labor, you will make a large\r\nquantity of very good cheese, and thus add largely to the profit of your\r\nestablishment, and to the comfort and prosperity of your family.\r\n\r\nBut, if you devote all your attention to the making of cheese, whether\r\nit is to be sold green, or as soon as ripe, or packed for exportation, I\r\nneed not say that the same neatness is required as in the making of\r\nbutter. You will find many suggestions in the preceding pages on the\r\nmode of preparation and packing, which I trust will prove to be valuable\r\nand applicable to your circumstances. There is a general complaint among\r\nthe dealers in cheese that it is difficult to get a superior article.\r\nThis state of things ought not to exist. I hope the time is not far\r\ndistant when a more general attention will be paid to the details of\r\nmanufacture, and let me remind you that those who take the first steps\r\nin improvement will reap the greatest advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PIGGERY AS A PART OF THE DAIRY ESTABLISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe keeping of swine is incidental to the well-managed dairy, and both\r\nthe farmer and the dairyman unite it, to some extent, with other\r\nbranches of farming.\r\n\r\nIn the regular operations of the dairy, however economically conducted,\r\nthere will always be more or less refuse in the shape of whey,\r\nbutter-milk, or skim-milk, which may be consumed with profit by swine,\r\nand which might otherwise be lost. Dairy-fed pork is distinguished for\r\nits fineness and delicacy; and the dairy refuse, in connection with\r\ngrains, potatoes, and scraps, is highly nutritious and fattening.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide difference between the profit to be derived from the\r\ndifferent breeds. Some are far more thrifty than others, and arrive at\r\nmaturity earlier. But the choice of a breed will depend, to considerable\r\nextent, on the locality and the object in view, whether it be to breed\r\nfor sale as stock, or for pork or bacon.\r\n\r\nTo get desirable crosses, some breeds must be kept pure, especially in\r\nthe hands of stock breeders, or those who raise to sell as pure-bred,\r\neven though as pure breeds they may not be most profitable to the\r\npractical farmer and dairyman. Those who confine themselves to the pure\r\nbreeds, therefore, do good service to the community of farmers and\r\ndairymen, who can avail themselves of the results of their experience\r\nand skill.\r\n\r\nI think it will generally be conceded that the size of the male is of\r\nless importance than his form, his tendency to lay on large amounts of\r\nfat in proportion to the food he eats, or his early maturity. Smallness\r\nof bone and compactness of form indicate early maturity; and this is an\r\nessential element in the calculations of the dairy farmer, who generally\r\nraises for pork rather than for bacon, and whose profit will consist in\r\nfattening and turning early, or, at most, as young as from twelve to\r\nfifteen months. A fine and delicate quality of pork is at the present\r\ntime highly prized in the markets, and commands the highest price. For\r\nbacon, a much larger hog is preferred; but there can be little doubt\r\nthat the cross of the pure Suffolk or Berkshire boar and the large,\r\nheavy and coarse sow, not uncommon in the Western States, would produce\r\nan offspring far superior to the class of hogs usually denominated\r\n“subsoilers,” with their long and pointed snouts, and their thin, flabby\r\nsides. The principles of breeding, as stated on pp. 70 and 71, and\r\nelsewhere in the preceding pages, are equally applicable here, and are\r\nabundantly suggestive on many other points. This is the important point,\r\nthe selection of the proper breed and the proper cross: for there is\r\nscarcely any class of stock which varies so much in its net returns as\r\nthis; and there is none which, if properly selected and judiciously\r\nmanaged, returns the investment so quickly.\r\n\r\nThose who feed for the early market, and desire to realize the largest\r\nprofits with the least outlay of time and money, will resort to the\r\nSuffolk, the Berkshire, or the Essex, to obtain crosses with sows of the\r\nlarger breeds, and will breed up more or less closely to these breeds,\r\naccording to the special object they have in view. The Suffolks are\r\nnearly allied to the Chinese, and possess much the same characteristics.\r\nThough generally regarded as too small for profit except to those who\r\nbreed for stock, their extraordinary fattening qualities and their early\r\nmaturity adapt them eminently for crossing with the larger breeds. The\r\nform of the well-built Suffolk, when not too closely inbred, is a model\r\nof compactness, and lightness of bone and offal. Though often too short\r\nin the body, a large-boned female will generally correct this fault, and\r\nproduce an offspring suited to the wants of the dairy farmer.\r\n\r\nThe Berkshire is also mixed in with the Chinese, and owes no small part\r\nof its valuable characteristics to that race. The Berkshires, as a\r\nbreed, often attain considerable size and weight.\r\n\r\nThe improved Essex are the favorites of some, and for early maturity\r\nthey are difficult to surpass. Some think they require greater care and\r\nbetter feeding than the Berkshire.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanted is to unite, so far as possible, the early maturity and\r\nthe facility to take on fat of the Suffolk, the Chinese, or the Essex,\r\nwith a tendency at the same time to make flesh as well as fat; or, in\r\nother words, to attain a good growth and size, and to fatten easily when\r\nthe time comes to put them down. The Chinese or the Suffolk are but ill\r\nadapted for hams and bacon; but, crossed upon the kind of hog already\r\ndescribed, the produce will be likely to be valuable.\r\n\r\nThe most judicious practical farmers are new fully satisfied, I think,\r\nthat the tendency, for the last ten years, in the Eastern States more\r\nespecially, has been to breed too fine; and that the result of this\r\nerror has been to cover our swine with fat at a very early age, and\r\nbefore they have attained a respectable size. In other words, the flesh\r\nand bone have been too far sacrificed to fat. A reäction has already\r\ntaken place in the opinions on this point, and perhaps some caution may\r\nbe necessary, that it does not load too far in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nSome practical dairymen think that with a dairy of twenty or thirty cows\r\nthey can keep from forty to fifty swine, by turning into the orchard or\r\nthe pasture, in early spring, and as pigs, where they will easily\r\nprocure a large part of their food, till the close of fall, when they\r\nare taken in and fed up gradually at first, but afterward more highly,\r\nand fattened as rapidly and turned as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nOthers say there is no profit in working hogs, and that they should be\r\nkept confined and constantly and rapidly growing up to the time of\r\nturning them for pork, growing steadily, but not laying on too much fat\r\ntill fed up to it.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think the farmers of the Eastern States confine their\r\nswine too closely; and that, while still kept as store-pigs, a somewhat\r\ngreater range in the orchard, or the pasture, would prove to be good\r\neconomy, particularly up to the age of eight or nine months.\r\n\r\nThe judicious dairyman will study the taste and demands of the market\r\nwhere his pork is to be sold. If he supplies a city customer, he knows\r\nhe must raise a fine and delicate quality of pork; and to do this he\r\nmust select stock that will early arrive at maturity, and that will bear\r\nforcing ahead and selling young. If he supplies a market where large\r\namounts of pork are salted and packed for shipping, or for bacon, a\r\nlarger and coarser hog, fed to greater age and weight, will turn to\r\nbetter advantage, though I think a strain of finer blood will even then\r\nbe profitable to the feeder. In either case, the refuse of the dairy is\r\nof considerable value, and should be saved with scrupulous care, and\r\njudiciously fed. “Many a little makes a mickle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  The following is Mr. Thomas Horsfall’s statement, referred to on page\r\n  138, with the omission of a few passages, relating to matters not\r\n  immediately connected with the dairy. It is entitled\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE.\r\n\r\nOn entering upon a description of my treatment of cows for dairy\r\npurposes, it seems pertinent that I should give some explanation of the\r\nmotives and considerations which influence my conduct in this branch of\r\nmy farm operations.\r\n\r\nI have found it stated, on authority deserving attention, that store\r\ncattle of a fair size, and without other occupation, maintain their\r\nweight and condition for a length of time, when supplied daily with one\r\nhundred and twenty pounds of Swedish turnips and a small portion of\r\nstraw. The experience of the district of Craven, in Yorkshire, where\r\nmeadow hay is the staple food during winter, shows that such cattle\r\nmaintain their condition on one and a half stone, or twenty-one pounds,\r\nof meadow hay each per day. These respective quantities of turnips and\r\nof hay correspond very closely in their nutritive properties; they\r\ncontain a very similar amount of albuminous matter, starch, sugar, etc.,\r\nand also of phosphoric acid. Of oil--an important element, especially\r\nfor the purpose of which I am treating--the stated supply of meadow hay\r\ncontains more than that of turnips. If we supply cows in milk, of\r\naverage size, with the kind and quantity of food above mentioned, they\r\nwill lose perceptibly in condition. This is easily explained when we\r\nfind their milk rich in substances which serve for their support when in\r\nstore condition, and which are shown to be diverted in the secretion of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of towns where the dairy produce is disposed of in\r\nnew milk, and where the aim of dairymen is to produce the greatest\r\nquantity, too frequently with but little regard to quality, it is their\r\ncommon practice to purchase incalving cows. They pay great attention to\r\nthe condition of the cow; they will tell you, by the high comparative\r\nprice they pay for animals well stored with flesh and fat, that\r\ncondition is as valuable for them as it is for the butcher; they look\r\nupon these stores as materials which serve their purpose; they supply\r\nfood more adapted to induce quantity than quality, and pay but little\r\nregard to the maintenance of the condition of the animal. With such\r\ntreatment, the cow loses in condition during the process of milking, and\r\nwhen no longer profitable is sold to purchasers in farming districts\r\nwhere food is cheaper, to be fattened or otherwise replenished for the\r\nuse of the dairy keeper. We thus find a disposition in the cow to apply\r\nthe aliment of her food to her milk, rather than to lay on flesh or fat;\r\nfor not only are the elements of her food diverted to this purpose, but,\r\nto all appearance, her accumulated stores of flesh and fat are drawn\r\nupon, and converted into components of milk, cheese, or butter.\r\n\r\nAs I am differently circumstanced,--a considerable portion of my dairy\r\nproduce being intended for butter, for which poor milk is not\r\nadapted,--and as I fatten not only my own cows, but purchase others to\r\nfatten in addition, I have endeavored to devise food for my milch cows\r\nadapted to their maintenance and improvement, and with this view I have\r\npaid attention to the composition of milk. From several analyses I have\r\nselected one by Haidler, which I find in publications of repute. Taking\r\na full yield of milk, four gallons per day, which will weigh upwards of\r\nforty pounds, this analysis assigns to it of dry material 5.20, of which\r\nthe proportion, with sufficient accuracy for my purpose, consists of\r\n\r\n  Pure caseine,                2.00 pounds.\r\n  Butter,                      1.25    “\r\n  Sugar,                       1.75    “\r\n  Phosphate of lime,            .09    “\r\n  Chloride of potassium,\r\n  Other mineral ingredients,    .11    “\r\n                               ----\r\n                               5.20    “\r\n\r\nIt appeared an object of importance, and one which called for my\r\nparticular attention, to afford an ample supply of the elements of food\r\nsuited to the maintenance and likewise to the produce of the animal; and\r\nthat, if I omitted to effect this, the result would be imperfect and\r\nunsatisfactory. By the use of ordinary farm produce only, I could not\r\nhope to accomplish my purpose. Turnips are objectionable on account of\r\ntheir flavor; and I seek to avoid them as food for dairy purposes. I use\r\ncabbages, kohl rabi, and mangold wurzel, yet only in moderate\r\nquantities. Of meadow hay it would require, beyond the amount necessary\r\nfor the maintenance of the cow, an addition of fully twenty pounds for\r\nthe supply of caseine in a full yield of milk (sixteen quarts); forty\r\npounds for the supply of oil for the butter, whilst nine pounds seem\r\nadequate for that of the phosphoric acid. You cannot, then, induce a cow\r\nto consume the quantity of hay requisite for her maintenance, and for a\r\nfull yield of milk of the quality instanced. Though it is a subject of\r\ncontroversy whether butter is wholly derived from vegetable oil, yet the\r\npeculiar adaptation of this oil to the purpose will, I think, be\r\nadmitted. I had, therefore, to seek assistance from what are usually\r\ntermed artificial feeding substances, and to select such as are rich in\r\nalbumen, oil, and phosphoric acid; and I was bound also to pay regard to\r\ntheir comparative cost, with a view to profit, which, when farming is\r\nfollowed as a business, is a necessary, and in any circumstances an\r\nagreeable accompaniment.\r\n\r\nI think it will be found that substances peculiarly rich in nitrogenous\r\nor other elements have a higher value for special than for general\r\npurposes, and that the employment of materials characterized by peculiar\r\nproperties for the attainment of special objects has not yet gained the\r\nattention to which it is entitled.\r\n\r\nI have omitted all reference to the beat-supplying elements--starch,\r\nsugar, etc. As the materials commonly used as food for cattle contain\r\nsufficient of these to effect this object, under exposure to some degree\r\nof cold, I have a right to calculate on a less consumption of them as\r\nfuel, and consequently a greater surplus for deposit as sugar, and\r\nprobably also as fat, in consequence of my stalls being kept during\r\nwinter at a temperature of nearly sixty degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe means used to carry out his objects are stated on page 138.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs several of these materials--rape-cake, shorts, bean-straw, etc.--are\r\nnot commonly used as food, I may be allowed some observations on their\r\nproperties. Bean-straw uncooked is dry and unpalatable. By the process\r\nof steaming, it becomes soft and pulpy, emits an agreeable odor, and\r\nimparts flavor and relish to the mess. For my information and guidance I\r\nobtained an analysis of bean-straw of my own growth, on strong and\r\nhigh-conditioned land; it was cut on the short side of ripeness, but\r\nyielding a plump bean. The analysis by Professor Way shows a percentage\r\nof\r\n\r\n  Moisture,             14.47\r\n  Albuminous mater,     16.38\r\n  Oil or fatty matter,   2.23\r\n  Woody fibre,          25.84\r\n  Starch, gum, etc.,    31.63\r\n  Mineral matters,       9.45\r\n                       ------\r\n          Total        100.00\r\n\r\nIn albuminous matter, which is especially valuable for milch cows, it\r\nhas nearly double the proportion contained in meadow hay. Bran also\r\nundergoes a great improvement in its flavor by steaming, and it is\r\nprobably improved in its convertibility as food. It contains about\r\nfourteen per cent. of albumen, and is peculiarly rich in phosphoric\r\nacid, nearly three per cent. of its whole substance being of this\r\nmaterial. The properties of rape-cake are well known: the published\r\nanalyses give it a large proportion (nearly thirty per cent.) of\r\nalbumen; it is rich in phosphates, and also in oil. This is of the\r\nunctuous class of vegetable oils, and it is to this property that I call\r\nparticular attention. Chemistry will assign to this material, which has\r\nhitherto been comparatively neglected for feeding, a first place for the\r\npurpose of which I am treating. If objection should occur on account of\r\nits flavor, I have no difficulty in stating that by the preparation I\r\nhave described I have quite overcome this. I can easily persuade my\r\ncattle (of which sixty to eighty pass through my stalls in a year),\r\nwithout exception, to eat the requisite quantity. Nor is the flavor of\r\nthe cake in the least perceptible in the milk or butter.\r\n\r\nDuring May, my cows are turned out on a rich pasture near the homestead;\r\ntowards evening they are again housed for the night, when they are\r\nsupplied with a mess of the steamed mixture and a little hay each\r\nmorning and evening. During June, when the grasses are better grown,\r\nmown grass is given to them instead of hay, and they are also allowed\r\ntwo feeds of steamed mixture. This treatment is continued till October,\r\nwhen they are again wholly housed.\r\n\r\nThe results which I now proceed to relate are derived from observations\r\nmade with the view of enabling me to understand and regulate my own\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAIN OR LOSS OF CONDITION ASCERTAINED BY WEIGHING CATTLE\r\nPERIODICALLY.--For some years back I have regularly weighed my feeding\r\nstock, a practice from which I am enabled to ascertain their doings with\r\ngreater accuracy than I could previously. In January, 1854, I commenced\r\nweighing my milch cows. It has been shown, by what I have premised, that\r\nno accurate estimate can be formed of the effect of the food on the\r\nproduction of milk, without ascertaining its effect on the condition of\r\nthe cows. I have continued the practice once a month, almost without\r\nomission, up to this date. The weighings take place early in the\r\nmorning, and before the cows are supplied with food. The weights are\r\nregistered, and the length of time (fifteen months) during which I have\r\nobserved this practice enables me to speak with confidence of the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe cows in full milk, yielding twelve to sixteen quarts each per day,\r\nvary but little; some losing, others gaining, slightly; the balance in\r\nthe month’s weighing of this class being rather to gain. It is common\r\nfor a cow to continue a yield from six to eight months before she gives\r\nbelow twelve quarts per day, at which time she has usually, if not\r\ninvariably, gained weight.\r\n\r\nThe cows giving less than twelve quarts and down to five quarts per day\r\nare found, when free from ailment, to gain, without exception. This\r\ngain, with an average yield of nearly eight quarts per day, is at the\r\nrate of seven pounds to eight pounds per week each.\r\n\r\nMy cows in calf I weigh only in the incipient stages; but they gain\r\nperceptibly in condition, and consequently in value. They are milked\r\ntill within four weeks to five weeks previous to calving. I give the\r\nweights of three of these, and also of one heifer, which calved in\r\nMarch, 1855:\r\n\r\n  -+--------------------+-------------------++--------------------------\r\n  N|                    |                   ||\r\n  o|                    |                   ||\r\n  .|                    |       1854.       ||        1855.       |Gain.\r\n  -+--------------------+-----+-------------++------+-------------+-----\r\n   |                    |     |cwt. qr. lbs.||      |cwt. qr. lbs.| lbs.\r\n  1|Bought and weighed, |July.| 10   1   20 ||April.| 11   3   0  | 148\r\n  2|Bought and weighed, |  “  |  8   2   10 ||   “  | 10   2   0  | 214\r\n  3|Bought and weighed, |  “  |  8   2    0 ||   “  | 10   0   0  | 184\r\n  4|Heifer, which calved|     |             ||      |             |\r\n   |also in March, 1855,|     |             ||      |             |\r\n   |weighed             |  “  |  7   0    0 ||   “  |  9   3   0  | 300\r\n  -+--------------------+-----+-------------++------+-------------+-----\r\n\r\nThese observations extend over lengthened periods, on the same animals,\r\nof from thirty to upwards of fifty weeks. A cow, free from calf, and\r\nintended for fattening, continues to give milk from ten months to a year\r\nafter calving, and is then in a forward state of fatness requiring but\r\na few weeks to finish her for sale to the butchers.\r\n\r\nIt will thus appear that my endeavors to provide food adapted to the\r\nmaintenance and improvement of my milch cows have been attended with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nOn examining the composition of the ordinary food which I have\r\ndescribed, straw, roots, and hay, it appears to contain the nutritive\r\nproperties which are found adequate to the maintenance of the animal,\r\nwhereas the yield of milk has to be provided for by a supply of extra\r\nfood; the rape-cake, bran, and bean-meal, which I give, will supply the\r\nalbumen for the caseine; it is somewhat deficient in oil for the butter,\r\nwhilst it will supply in excess the phosphate of lime for a full yield\r\nof milk. If I take the class of cows giving less than twelve quarts per\r\nday, and take also into account a gain of flesh of seven to nine pounds\r\nper week, though I reduce the quantity of extra food by giving less of\r\nthe bean-meal, yet the supply will be more in proportion than with a\r\nfull yield; the surplus of nitrogen and phosphoric acid, or phosphate of\r\nlime, will go to enrich the manure.\r\n\r\nI cannot here omit to remark on the satisfaction I derive from the\r\neffects of this treatment on the fertility of the land in my occupation.\r\nMy rich pastures are not tending to impoverishment, but to increased\r\nfertility; their improvement in condition is apparent. A cow in full\r\nmilk, giving sixteen quarts per day, of the quality analyzed by Haidlen,\r\nrequires, beyond the food necessary for her maintenance, six to eight\r\npounds per day of substances containing thirty or twenty-five per cent.\r\nof protein. A cow giving on the average eight quarts per day, with which\r\nshe gains seven to nine pounds per week, requires four to five pounds\r\nper day of substances rich in protein, beyond the food which is\r\nnecessary for her maintenance. Experience of fattening gives two pounds\r\nper day, or fourteen pounds per week, as what can be attained on an\r\naverage, and for a length of time. If we considered half a pound per day\r\nas fat, which is not more than probable, there will be one and a half\r\npounds for flesh, which, reckoned as dry material, will be about one\r\nthird of a pound, which is assimilated in increase of fibrin, and\r\nrepresents only one and one third to two pounds of substances rich in\r\nprotein, beyond what is required for her maintenance.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the effects on the fertility of the land, my milch cows,\r\nwhen on rich pasture, and averaging a yield of nine quarts per day, and\r\nreckoning one cow to each acre, will carry off in twenty weeks\r\ntwenty-five pounds of nitrogen, equal to thirty of ammonia. The same\r\nquantity of milk will carry off seven pounds of phosphate of lime in\r\ntwenty weeks from each acre.\r\n\r\nA fattening animal, gaining flesh at the rate I have described, will\r\ncarry off about one third of the nitrogen (equal to about ten pounds of\r\nammonia) abstracted by the milch cow, whilst if full grown it will\r\nrestore the whole of the phosphate.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that experience shows that rich pastures, used\r\nfor fattening, fully maintain their fertility through a long series of\r\nyears, whilst those used for dairy cows require periodical dressings to\r\npreserve their fertility.\r\n\r\nIf these computations be at all accurate, they tend to show that too\r\nlittle attention has been given to the supply of substances rich in\r\nnitrogenous compounds in the food of our milch cows, whilst we have laid\r\ntoo much stress on this property in food for fattening cattle. They tend\r\nalso to the inference that in the effects on the fertility of our\r\npastures used for dairy purposes we derive advantage not only from the\r\nphosphate of lime, but also from the gelatine of bones used as manure.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the results from my milch cows fed in summer on rich\r\npasture, and treated at the same time with the extra food I have\r\ndescribed, with the results when on winter food, and whilst wholly\r\nhoused, taking into account both the yield of milk and the gain of\r\nweight, I find those from stall-feeding full equal to those from\r\ndepasture. The cows which I buy as strippers, for fattening, giving\r\nlittle milk, from neighboring farmers who use ordinary food, such as\r\nturnips with straw or hay, when they come under my treatment increase\r\ntheir yield of milk, until after a week or two they give two quarts per\r\nday more than when they came, and that too of a much richer quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHNESS OF MILK AND CREAM.--I sometimes observe, in the weekly\r\npublications which come under my notice, accounts of cows giving large\r\nquantities of butter. These are usually, however, extraordinary\r\ninstances, and not accompanied with other statistical information\r\nrequisite to their being taken as a guide; and it seldom happens that\r\nany allusion is made to the effects of the food on the condition of the\r\nanimals, without which no accurate estimate can be arrived at. On\r\nlooking over several treatises to which I have access, I find the\r\nfollowing statistics on dairy produce: Mr. Morton, in his “Cyclopædia of\r\nAgriculture,” p. 621, gives the results of the practice of a Mr. Young,\r\nan extensive dairy-keeper in Scotland. The yield of milk per cow is\r\nstated at six hundred and eighty gallons per year; he obtains from\r\nsixteen quarts of milk twenty ounces of butter, or for the year two\r\nhundred and twenty-seven pounds per cow; from one gallon of cream three\r\npounds of butter, or twelve ounces per quart (wine measure). Mr. Young\r\nis described as a high feeder; linseed is his chief auxiliary food for\r\nmilch cows. Professor Johnston (“Elements of Agricultural Chemistry”)\r\ngives the proportion of butter from milk at one and a half ounces per\r\nquart, or from sixteen quarts twenty-four ounces, being the produce of\r\nfour cows of different breeds,--Alderney, Devon, and Ayrshire,--on\r\npasture, and in the height of the summer season. On other four cows of\r\nthe Ayrshire breed he gives the proportion of butter from sixteen quarts\r\nas sixteen ounces, being one ounce per quart. These cows were likewise\r\non pasture. The same author states the yield of butter as one fourth of\r\nthe weight of cream, or about ten ounces per quart. Mr. Rowlandson\r\n(“Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society,” vol. xiii., p. 38) gives\r\nthe produce of 20,110 quarts of milk churned by hand as 1109 pounds of\r\nbutter, being at the rate of fully 14 ounces per 16 quarts of milk; and\r\nfrom 23,156 quarts of milk 1525 pounds of butter, being from 16 quarts\r\nnearly 16³⁄₄ ounces of butter. The same author states that the yield of\r\nbutter derived from five churnings, of 15 quarts of cream each, is\r\nsomewhat less than 8 ounces per quart of cream. Dr. Muspratt, in his\r\nwork on the “Chemistry of Arts and Manufactures,” which is in the course\r\nof publication, gives the yield of butter from a cow per year in\r\nHolstein and Lunenburg at 100 pounds, in England at 160 pounds to 180\r\npounds. The average of butter from a cow in England is stated to be\r\neight or nine ounces per day, which, on a yield of eight to nine quarts,\r\nis one ounce per quart, or for sixteen quarts sixteen ounces. The\r\nquantity of butter derived from cream is stated as one fourth, which is\r\nequal to about nine ounces per quart. The richest cream of which I find\r\nany record is that brought to the Royal Society’s meeting during the\r\nmonth of July, for the churns which compete for the prize. On referring\r\nto the proceedings of several meetings, I find that fourteen ounces per\r\nquart of cream is accounted a good yield.\r\n\r\nI have frequently tested the yield of butter from a given quantity of my\r\nmilk. My dairy produce is partly disposed of in new milk, partly in\r\nbutter and old milk, so that it became a matter of business to ascertain\r\nby which mode it gave the best return. I may here remark that my dairy\r\npractice has been throughout on high feeding, though it has undergone\r\nseveral modifications. The mode of ascertaining the average yield of\r\nbutter from milk has been to measure the milk on the churning-day, after\r\nthe cream has been skimmed off, then to measure the cream, and having,\r\nby adding together the two measurements, ascertained the whole quantity\r\nof milk (including the cream), to compare it with that of the butter\r\nobtained. This I consider a more accurate method than measuring the new\r\nmilk, as there is a considerable escape of gas, and consequent\r\nsubsidence, whilst it is cooling. The results have varied from\r\ntwenty-four to twenty-seven and a quarter ounces from sixteen quarts of\r\nmilk. I therefore assume in my calculation sixteen quarts of milk as\r\nyielding a roll (twenty-five ounces) of butter.\r\n\r\nAs I have at times a considerable number of cows bought as strippers,\r\nand fattened as they are milked, which remain sometimes in my stalls\r\neight or nine months, and yield towards the close but five quarts per\r\nday, I am not enabled to state with accuracy and from ascertained data\r\nthe average yield per year of my cows kept for dairy purposes solely.\r\nHowever, from what occurs at grass-time, when the yield is not\r\nincreased, and also from the effects of my treatment on cows which I\r\nbuy, giving a small quantity, I am fully persuaded that my treatment\r\ninduces a good yield of milk.\r\n\r\nAs the yield of butter from a given quantity of cream is not of such\r\nparticular consequence, I have not given equal attention to ascertain\r\ntheir relative proportions. I have a recollection of having tested this\r\non a former occasion, when I found fourteen to sixteen ounces per quart,\r\nbut cannot call to mind under what treatment this took place.\r\n\r\nOn questioning my dairy-woman, in December, 1854, as to the proportion\r\nof cream and butter, she reported nearly one roll of twenty-five ounces\r\nof butter to one quart of cream. I looked upon this as a mistake. On its\r\naccuracy being persisted in, the next churning was carefully observed,\r\nwith a like proportion. My dairy cows averaged then a low range of milk\r\nas to quantity--about eight quarts each per day. Six of them, in a\r\nforward state of fatness, were intended to be dried for finishing off in\r\nJanuary; but, owing to the scarcity and consequent dearness of calving\r\ncows, I kept them on in milk till I could purchase cows to replace them,\r\nand it was not till February that I had an opportunity of doing so. I\r\nthen bought four cows within a few days of calving; they were but in\r\ninferior condition, and yielded largely of milk. Towards the close of\r\nFebruary and March, four of my own dairy cows, in full condition,\r\nlikewise calved. During March, three of the six which had continued from\r\nDecember, and were milked nearly up to the day of sale, were selected by\r\nthe butcher as fit for his purpose. Each churning throughout was\r\ncarefully observed, with a similar result, varying but little from\r\ntwenty-five ounces of butter per quart of cream; on Monday, April 30,\r\nsixteen quarts of cream having yielded sixteen rolls (of twenty-five\r\nounces each) of butter. Though I use artificial means of raising the\r\ntemperature of my dairy, by the application of hot water during cold\r\nweather, yet, my service-pipes being frozen in February, I was unable to\r\nkeep up the temperature, and it fell to forty-five degrees. Still my\r\ncream, though slightly affected, was peculiarly rich, yielding\r\ntwenty-two ounces of butter per quart. Throughout April the produce of\r\nmilk from my fifteen dairy cows averaged full one hundred and sixty\r\nquarts per day.\r\n\r\nMy cows are bought in the neighboring markets with a view to their\r\nusefulness and profitableness. The breeds of this district have a\r\nconsiderable admixture of the short-horn, which is not noted for the\r\nrichness of its milk. It will be remarked that during the time these\r\nobservations have been continued on the proportion of butter from cream,\r\nmore than half of my cows have been changed.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied myself that the peculiar richness of my cream was due\r\nmainly to the treatment of my cows which I have sought to describe, it\r\noccurred to me that I ought not to keep it to myself, inasmuch as these\r\nresults of my dairy practice not only afforded matter of interest to the\r\nfarmer, but were fit subjects for the investigation of the physiologist\r\nand the chemist. Though my pretensions to acquirements in their\r\ninstructions are but slender, they are such as enable me to acknowledge\r\nbenefit in seeking to regulate my proceedings by their rules.\r\n\r\nIn taking off the cream I use an ordinary shallow skimmer of tin\r\nperforated with holes, through which any milk gathered in skimming\r\nescapes. It requires care to clear the cream; and even with this some\r\nstreakiness is observable on the surface of the skimmed milk. The\r\nmilk-bowls are of glazed brown earthen ware, common in this district.\r\nThey stand on a base of six to eight inches, and expand at the surface\r\nto nearly twice that width. Four to five quarts are contained in each\r\nbowl, the depth being four to five inches at the centre. The churn I use\r\nis a small wooden one, worked by hand, on what I believe to be the\r\nAmerican principle. I have forwarded to Professor Way a small sample of\r\nbutter for analysis; fifteen quarts of cream were taken out of the\r\ncream-jar, and churned at three times in equal portions:\r\n\r\n  The first five quarts of cream gave 127    ounces of butter.\r\n  Second five      “     “   “     “  125      “     “   “\r\n  Third five       “     “   “     “  120¹⁄₂   “     “   “\r\n                                      ------\r\n                                      372¹⁄₂\r\n\r\n                 Equal to 24³⁄₄ ounces per quart.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent churning of fourteen quarts of cream,\r\n\r\n  The first seven gave 7 rolls, or    175 ounces of butter.\r\n  Second seven gave 7 rolls 2 oz., or 177   “    “    “\r\n                                      ---\r\n                                      352\r\n\r\n                 Equal to 25¹⁄₇ ounces per quart.\r\n\r\nOn testing the comparative yield of butter and of butter-milk, I find\r\nseventy per cent. of butter to thirty per cent. of butter-milk, thus\r\nreversing the proportions given in the publications to which I have\r\nreferred. An analysis of my butter by Professor Way gives:\r\n\r\n  Pure fat or oil,            82.70\r\n  Caseine or curd,             2.45\r\n  Water, with a little salt,  14.85\r\n                             ------\r\n            Total,           100.00\r\n\r\nThe only analyses of this material which I find in the publications in\r\nmy hand are two by Professor Way, “Journal,” vol. xi., p. 735, “On\r\nbutter by the common and by the Devonshire method;” the result in one\r\nhundred parts being:\r\n\r\n                  Raw.   Scalded.\r\n  Pure butter,   79.72    79.12\r\n  Caseine, &c.,   3.38     3.37\r\n  Water,         16.90    17.51\r\n                ------   ------\r\n         Total, 100.00   100.00\r\n\r\nThe foregoing observation of dairy results was continued up to grass\r\ntime in 1855. In April and May the use of artificial means was\r\ndiscontinued, without diminution in the yield of butter or richness of\r\ncream, the natural temperature being sufficient to maintain that of my\r\ndairy at 54° to 56°.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to describe the appearances since that time. In the summer\r\nseason, whilst my cows were grazing in the open pastures during the day\r\nand housed during the night, being supplied with a limited quantity of\r\nthe steamed food each morning and evening, a marked change occurred in\r\nthe quality of the milk and cream; the quantity of the latter somewhat\r\nincreased, but, instead of twenty-five ounces of butter per quart of\r\ncream, my summer cream yielded only sixteen ounces per quart.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood to attribute this variation in quality to the\r\nchange of food only. It is commonly observed by dairy-keepers that milk,\r\nduring the warm months of summer, is less rich in butter, owing probably\r\nto the greater restlessness of the cows, from being teased by flies,\r\netc. I am by no means sure that, if turning out during the warm months\r\nbe at all advisable, it would not be preferable that this should take\r\nplace during the night instead of during the day time. Towards the close\r\nof September, when the temperature had become much cooler, and the cows\r\nwere supplied with a much larger quantity of the steamed food, results\r\nappeared very similar to those which I had observed and described from\r\nDecember to May, 1855. During the month of November the quality was\r\ntested with the following result:\r\n\r\nFrom two hundred and fifty-two quarts of old milk were taken twenty-one\r\nquarts of cream, of which twenty were churned, and produced four hundred\r\nand sixty-eight ounces of butter, which shows:\r\n\r\n  27.50 ounces of butter from 16 quarts of new milk.\r\n  23.40   “    “    “      “  each quart of cream.\r\n\r\nDuring May, 1856, my cows being on open pasture during the day were\r\nsupplied with two full feeds of the steamed mixture, together with a\r\nsupply of green rape-plant each morning and evening.\r\n\r\nThe result was that from three hundred and twenty-four quarts of old\r\nmilk twenty-three quarts of cream were skimmed, of which twenty-two were\r\nchurned, and produced five hundred and fifteen ounces of butter, which\r\nshows:\r\n\r\n  24    ounces of butter from 16 quarts of new milk.\r\n  22.41   “    “    “      “  each quart of cream.\r\n\r\nThere is, doubtless, some standard of food adapted to the constitution\r\nand purposes of animals, combining with bulk a due proportion of\r\nelements of respiration, such as sugar, starch, &c., together with those\r\nof nutrition, namely, nitrogenous compounds, phosphates, and other\r\nminerals; nor can we omit oil or fat-forming substances; for, however we\r\nmay be disposed to leave to philosophy the discussion as to whether\r\nsugar, starch, &c., are convertible into fat, yet I think I shall not\r\noffend the teacher of agricultural chemistry by stating that the more\r\nclosely the elements of food resemble those in the animal and its\r\nproduct, the more efficacious will such food be for the particular\r\npurpose for which it is used.\r\n\r\nSugar, starch, &c., vary very considerably in form and proportion from\r\nvegetable oils, which closely resemble animal fats.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that plants have a two-fold function to\r\nperform,--namely, to serve as food for animals, and also for the\r\nreproduction of the like plants,--and that, after having undergone the\r\nprocess of digestion, they retain only one half or one third of their\r\nvalue as manure, the importance of affording a due but not excessive\r\nsupply of each element of food essential to the wants and purposes of\r\nthe animal will be evident. If we fall short, the result will be\r\nimperfect; if we supply in excess, it will entail waste and loss.\r\n\r\nLinseed and rape-cake resemble each other very closely in chemical\r\ncomposition; the latter is chiefly used for manure, and its price ranges\r\nusually about half that of linseed-cake. In substances poorer in\r\nnitrogen, and with more of starch, gum, oil, &c., the disparity in value\r\nas food and as manure will be proportionately greater.\r\n\r\nDuring the present season, Mr. Mendelsohn, of Berlin, and Mr. Gausange,\r\nwho is tenant of a large royal domain near Frankfort on the Oder, on\r\nwhich he keeps about one hundred and fifty dairy cows, have been my\r\nvisitors. These gentlemen have collected statistics in dairy countries\r\nthrough which they have travelled. I learned from them that in\r\nMecklenburg, Prussia, Holland, &c., fourteen quarts of milk yield, on\r\nthe average, one pound of butter; in rare instances twelve quarts are\r\nfound to yield one pound. Both attach great importance to the regulation\r\nof the temperature. Mr. Mendelsohn tells me that the milk from cows fed\r\non draff (distillers’ refuse) requires a higher temperature to induce\r\nits yield of butter than that from cows supplied with other food.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry in my own neighborhood, I find it is computed that each quart\r\nat a milking represents one pound of butter per week. Thus, a cow which\r\ngives four quarts at each milking will yield in butter four pounds per\r\nweek, or from fifty-six quarts sixty-four ounces of butter, or from\r\nfourteen quarts of milk one pound of butter. Taking the winter produce\r\nalone, it is lower than this; the cream from my neighbors’ cows, who use\r\ncommon food, hay, straw, and oats, somewhat resembles milk in\r\nconsistence, and requires three to four hours, sometimes more, in\r\nchurning. On one occasion, a neighboring dairy-woman sent to borrow my\r\nchurn, being unable to make butter with her own; I did not inquire the\r\nresult. If she had sent her cow, I could in the course of a week have\r\ninsured her cream which would make butter in half an hour. These dairy\r\npeople usually churn during winter in their kitchen, or other room with\r\na fire. Each of them states that from bean or oat meal used during\r\nwinter as an auxiliary food they derive a greater quantity of butter,\r\nwhilst those who have tried linseed-oil have perceived no benefit from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMy own cream during the winter season is of the consistence of paste,\r\nor thick treacle. When the jar is full, a rod of two feet long will,\r\nwhen dipped into the cream to half its length, stand erect. If I take\r\nout a teacupful in the evening, and let it stand till next morning, a\r\npenny-piece laid on its surface will not sink; on taking it off, I find\r\nthe under side partially spotted with cream. The churnings are performed\r\nin a room without fire, at a temperature in winter of forty-three to\r\nforty-five degrees, and occupy one half to three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nSeveral who have adopted my system have reported similar effects--an\r\nincrease in the quantity with a complete change as to richness of\r\nquality. I select from these Mr. John Simpson, a tenant farmer residing\r\nat Ripley, in Yorkshire, who, at my request, stated to the committee of\r\nthe Wharfdale Agricultural Society that he and a neighbor of his, being\r\ninconvenienced from a deficient yield of milk, had agreed to try my mode\r\nof feeding, and provided themselves with a steaming apparatus. This\r\nchange of treatment took place in February, 1855. I quote his words:\r\n\r\n“In about five days I noticed a great change in my milk; the cows\r\nyielded two quarts each, per day, more; but what surprised me most was\r\nthe change in the quality. Instead of poor winter cream and butter, they\r\nassumed the appearance and character of rich summer produce. It only\r\nrequired twenty minutes for churning, instead of two to three hours;\r\nthere was also a considerable increase in the quantity of butter, of\r\nwhich, however, I did not take any particular notice. My neighbor’s cow\r\ngave three quarts per day in addition, and her milk was so changed in\r\nappearance that the consumers to whom he sold it became quite anxious to\r\nknow the cause.”\r\n\r\nMy dairy is but six feet wide by fifteen long and twelve high. At one\r\nend (to the north) is a trellis window; at the other, an inner door,\r\nwhich opens into the kitchen. There is another door near to this, which\r\nopens into the churning-room, having also a northern aspect; both doors\r\nare near the south end of the dairy. Along each side, and the north\r\nend, two shelves of wood are fixed to the wall, the one fifteen inches\r\nabove the other; two feet higher is another shelf somewhat narrower, but\r\nof like length, which is covered with charcoal, whose properties as a\r\ndeodorizer are sufficiently established. The lower shelves being two\r\nfeet three inches wide, the interval or passage between is only one foot\r\nsix inches. On each tier of shelves is a shallow wooden cistern, lined\r\nwith thin sheet-lead, having a rim at the edges three inches high. These\r\ncisterns incline downwards slightly towards the window, and contain\r\nwater to the depth of three inches. At the end nearest the kitchen each\r\ntier of cisterns is supplied with two taps, one for cold water in\r\nsummer, the other with hot for winter use. At the end next the north\r\nwindow is a plug or hollow tube, with holes perforated at such an\r\nelevation as to take the water before it flows over the cistern.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the door towards the kitchen is closed, and an\r\nadditional door is fixed against it, with an interval between well\r\npacked with straw; a curtain of stout calico hangs before the trellis\r\nwindow, which is dipped in salt water, and kept wet during the whole day\r\nby cold water spirted over it from a gutta-percha tube. On the milk\r\nbeing brought in, it is emptied into bowls. Some time after these bowls\r\n(of which a description is given in a former part of this) have been\r\nplaced on the cistern, the cold-water taps are turned till the water\r\nrises through the perforated tube, and flows through a waste pipe into\r\nthe sewer. The taps are then closed, so as to allow a slight trickling\r\nof water, which continues through the day. By these means I reduce the\r\ntemperature, as compared with that outside the window, by twenty\r\ndegrees. I am thus enabled to allow the milk to stand till the cream has\r\nrisen, and keep the skimmed milk sweet, for which I obtain one penny per\r\nquart.\r\n\r\nHaving heard complaints during very hot weather of skimmed milk, which\r\nhad left my dairy perfectly sweet, being affected so as to curdle in\r\ncooking on being carried into the village, I caused covers of thick\r\ncalico (the best of our fabrics for retaining moisture) to be made;\r\nthese are dipped in salt water, and then drawn over the whole of the tin\r\nmilk-cans. The contrivance is quite successful, and is in great favor\r\nwith the consumers. I have not heard a single complaint since I adopted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFinding my butter rather soft in hot weather, I uncovered a draw-well\r\nwhich I had not used since I introduced water-works for the supply of\r\nthe village and my own premises. On lowering a thermometer down the well\r\nto a depth of twenty-eight feet, I found it indicated a temperature of\r\nforty-three degrees--that on the surface being seventy degrees. I first\r\nlet down the butter, which was somewhat improved, but afterwards the\r\ncream. For this purpose I procured a movable windlass with a rope of the\r\nrequired length; the cream-jar is placed in a basket two feet four\r\ninches deep, suspended on the rope, and let down the evening previous to\r\nchurning. It is drawn up early next morning, and immediately churned. By\r\nthis means the churning occupies about the same time as in winter, and\r\nthe butter is of like consistence.\r\n\r\nThe advantage I derive from this is such that, rather than be without\r\nit, I should prefer sinking a well for the purpose of reaching a like\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nWhen winter approaches, the open trellis window to the north is closed,\r\nan additional shutter being fixed outside, and the interval between this\r\nand an inner shutter closely packed with straw, to prevent the access of\r\nair and cold; the door to the kitchen is at the same time unclosed to\r\nadmit warmth. Before the milk is brought from the cow-house, the\r\ndairymaid washes the bowls well with hot water, the effect of which is\r\nto take off the chill, but not to warm them. The milk is brought in as\r\nmilked, and is passed through a sile into the bowls, which are then\r\nplaced on the cistern. A thermometer, with its bulb immersed in the\r\nmilk, denotes a temperature of about ninety degrees. The hot water is\r\napplied immediately, at a temperature of one hundred degrees or\r\nupwards, and continues to flow for about five minutes, when the supply\r\nis exhausted. The bowls being of thick earthen ware,--a slow\r\nconductor,--this does not heighten the temperature of the milk. The\r\ncooling, however, is thereby retarded, as I find the milk, after\r\nstanding four hours, maintains a temperature of sixty degrees. This\r\napplication of hot water is renewed at each milking to the new milk, but\r\nnot repeated to the same after it has cooled. The temperature of the\r\ndairy is momentarily increased to above 60°, but speedily subsides, the\r\naverage temperature being 52° to 56°.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the churnings in summer and winter occupy half\r\nan hour or upwards. By increasing the temperature of the cream I could\r\neasily churn in half the time, but I should thereby injure the quality\r\nof the butter. When the butter has come and gathered into a mass, it is\r\ntaken, together with the butter-milk, out of the churn, which is rinsed\r\nwith water; the butter is then placed again in the churn with a quantity\r\nof cold spring water, in which salt has been dissolved, at the rate of\r\none ounce per quart of cream; after a few minutes’ churning, the butter\r\nis again taken out; the water in which it has been washed assumes a\r\nwhitish appearance. By this process the salt is equally diffused through\r\nthe butter, which requires little manipulation, and is freed from a\r\nportion of caseous matter. A recent analysis of my butter shows only\r\n1.07 instead of 2.45 per cent. of caseine, as before. That it ranks as\r\nchoice may be inferred when I state that my purchaser willingly gives me\r\na penny per roll more than the highest price in Otley market, and\r\ncomplains that I do not supply him with a greater quantity.\r\n\r\nIn this dairy of the small dimensions I have described, my produce of\r\nbutter reaches at times sixty to seventy pounds per week. Though the\r\nsize may appear inconveniently small, yet I beg to remark on the greater\r\nfacility of regulating the temperature of a small in comparison with a\r\nlarge dairy. This difficulty will be found greater in summer than in\r\nwinter, as it is far easier to heighten than depress the temperature.\r\n\r\nI have cooked or steamed my food for several years. It will be observed\r\nthat I blend bean-straw, bran, and malt-combs, as flavoring materials,\r\nwith oat or other straw and rape-cake; the effect of steaming is to\r\nvolatilize the essential oils, in which the flavor resides, and diffuse\r\nthem through the mess. The odor arising from it resembles that observed\r\nfrom the process of malting; this imparts relish to the mess, and\r\ninduces the cattle to eat it greedily; in addition to which, I am\r\ndisposed to think that it renders the food more easy of digestion and\r\nassimilation. I use this process with advantage for fattening, when I am\r\ndeficient in roots. With the same mixed straw and oat-shells, three to\r\nfour pounds each of rape-cake, and half a pound of linseed-oil, but\r\nwithout roots, I have fattened more than thirty heifers and cows free\r\nfrom milk, from March up to the early part of May; their gain has\r\naveraged fully fourteen pounds each per week,--a result I could not have\r\nlooked for from the same materials, if uncooked. This process seems to\r\nhave the effect of rendering linseed-oil less of a laxative, but cannot\r\ndrive off any portion of the fattening oils, to volatilize which\r\nrequires a very high temperature. My experience of the benefits of\r\nsteaming is such that if I were deprived of it I could not continue to\r\nfeed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI have weighed my fattening cattle for a number of years, and my milch\r\ncows for more than two years. This practice enables me at once to detect\r\nany deficiency in the performance of the animals; it gives also a\r\nstimulus to the feeders, who attend at the weighings, and who are\r\ndesirous that the cattle intrusted to their care should bear a\r\ncomparison with their rivals. Another obvious advantage is in avoiding\r\nall cavils respecting the weight by my purchasers, who, having satisfied\r\nthemselves as to the quality of the animal, now ask and obtain the most\r\nrecent weighing. The usual computation for a well-fed but not over fat\r\nbeast is, live to dead weight, as 21 to 12, or 100 to 59¹⁄₇ with such\r\nmodifications as suggest themselves by appearances.\r\n\r\nThough many discussions have taken place on the fattening of cattle, the\r\nnot less important branch of dairy treatment has hitherto been\r\ncomparatively neglected. I therefore venture to call attention to\r\nconsiderations which have arisen from observations in my own practice\r\naffecting the chemistry and physiology, or, in other words, the science\r\nof feeding. That I am seeking aid from its guidance will be apparent,\r\nand I have no hesitation in admitting that, beyond the satisfaction from\r\nthe better understanding of my business, I have latterly derived more\r\nbenefit or profit from examination of the chemical composition of\r\nmaterials of food than from the treatment or feeding experiments of\r\nothers which have come under my notice. So persuaded am I of the\r\nadvantage of this, that I do not feel satisfied to continue the use of\r\nany material, with the composition of which I am not acquainted, without\r\nresorting to the society’s laboratory for an analysis.\r\n\r\n_To one leading feature of my practice I attach the greatest\r\nimportance--the maintenance of the condition of my cows giving a large\r\nyield of milk._ I am enabled, by the addition of bean-meal in proportion\r\nto the greater yield of milk, to avert the loss of condition in those\r\ngiving sixteen to eighteen quarts per day; whilst on those giving a less\r\nyield, and in health, I invariably effect an improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen we take into consideration the disposition of a cow to apply her\r\nfood rather to her milk than to her maintenance and improvement, it\r\nseems fair to infer that the milk of a cow gaining flesh will not be\r\ndeficient either in caseine or butter.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the efficiency of bean-meal in increasing the\r\nquantity of butter: I learn, also, from observant dairymen who milk\r\ntheir own cows and carry their butter to market, that their baskets are\r\nnever so well filled as when their cows feed on green clover, which, as\r\ndry material, is nearly as rich in albumen as beaus. I am also told, by\r\nthose who have used green rape-plant, that it produces milk rich in\r\nbutter. From this we may infer that albuminous matter is the most\r\nessential element in the food of the milch cow, and that any deficiency\r\nin the supply of this will be attended with loss of condition, and a\r\nconsequent diminution in the quality of her milk.\r\n\r\nI am clearly of opinion that you can increase the proportion of butter\r\nin milk more than that of caseine, or other solid parts. From several,\r\nwho have adopted my treatment, I learn that on substituting rape-cake\r\nfor beans they perceive an increased richness in their milk. Mr. T.\r\nGarnett, of Clitheroe, who has used bean-meal largely as an auxiliary\r\nfood for milch cows during the winter season, tells me that when\r\nrape-cake is substituted, his dairymaid, without being informed,\r\nperceives the change from the increased richness of the milk. Mr.\r\nGarnett has also used linseed-cake in like quantity; still his dairy\r\npeople prefer rape-cake.\r\n\r\nMr. Whelon, of Lancaster, who keeps two milch cows for his own use, to\r\nwhich he gave bean-meal and bran as auxiliaries, has recently\r\nsubstituted rape-cake[4] for bean-meal; he informs me that in a week he\r\nsaw a change in the richness of milk, with an increase of butter.\r\n\r\n  [4] The analysis of cotton-seed cake, in comparison with rape and\r\n  linseed cake, in a former chapter of this work, will show the\r\n  comparative value of that as food for milch cows.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable oils are of two distinct classes: the _drying_ or\r\n_setting_ represented by linseed, the _unctuous_ represented by\r\nrape-oil. They consist of two proximate elements, margarine and oleine;\r\nin all probability they will vary in their proportion of these, but in\r\nwhat degree I have not been able to ascertain. Though the agricultural\r\nchemists make no distinction, as far as I am aware, between these two\r\nclasses of oils, the practitioners in medicine use them for distinct\r\npurposes. Cod-liver oil has been long used for pulmonary complaints;\r\nlatterly, olive, almond, and rape oils are being employed as\r\nsubstitutes. These are all of the unctuous class of oils. Mr. Rhind, the\r\nintelligent medical practitioner of this village, called my attention to\r\nsome experiments by Dr. Leared, published in the _Medical Times_, July\r\n21st, 1855, with oleine alone, freed from margarine, which showed\r\nmarked superiority in the effect; and I now learn from Mr. Rhind that he\r\nis at present using with success the pure oleine, prepared by Messrs.\r\nPrice & Co., from cocoa-nut oil, one of the unctuous class. That linseed\r\nand others of the drying oils are used in medicine for a very different\r\npurpose, it seems unnecessary to state.\r\n\r\nThe oleine of oil is known to be more easy of consumption and more\r\navailable for respiration than margarine--a property to which its use in\r\nmedicine may be attributable. If we examine the animal fats, tallow,\r\nsuet, and other fat, they are almost wholly of the solid class, stearine\r\nor margarine, closely resembling or identical with the margarine in\r\nplants; whilst butter is composed of oleine and margarine, combining\r\nboth the proximate elements found in vegetable oils.\r\n\r\nIt seems worthy of remark that a cow can yield a far greater weight of\r\nbutter than she can store up in solid fat; numerous instances occur\r\nwhere a cow gives off two pounds of butter per day, or fourteen pounds\r\nper week, whilst half that quantity will probably rarely be laid on in\r\nfat. If you allow a cow to gain sixteen pounds per week, and reckon\r\nseven for fat, there will only remain nine pounds for flesh, or,\r\ndeducting the moisture, scarcely three pounds (2.97) per week, equal to\r\n.42, or less than half a pound per day, of dry fibrin.\r\n\r\nThe analyses of butter show a very varying proportion of oleine and\r\nmargarine fats: summer butter usually contains of oleine sixty and\r\nmargarine forty per cent., whilst in winter butter these proportions are\r\nreversed, being forty of oleine to sixty of margarine. By ordinary\r\ntreatment the quantity of butter during winter is markedly inferior. The\r\ncommon materials for dairy cows in winter are straw with turnips or\r\nmangel, hay alone, or hay with mangel. If we examine these materials, we\r\nfind them deficient in oil, or in starch, sugar, etc. If a cow consume\r\ntwo stones or twenty-eight pounds of hay a day, which is probably more\r\nthan she can be induced to eat on an average, it will be equal in dry\r\nmaterial to more than one hundred pounds of young grass, which will\r\nalso satisfy a cow. That one hundred pounds of young grass will yield\r\nmore butter, will scarcely admit of a doubt. The twenty-eight pounds of\r\nhay will be equal in albuminous matter and in oil to the one hundred\r\npounds of grass; but in the element of starch, sugar, etc., there is a\r\nmarked difference. During the growth of the plant, the starch and sugar\r\nare converted into woody fibre, in which form they are scarcely\r\ndigestible or available for respiration. It seems, then, not improbable\r\nthat, when a cow is supplied with hay only, she will consume some\r\nportion of the oleine oil for respiration, and yield a less quantity of\r\nbutter poorer in oleine.\r\n\r\n  If you assume summer butter to contain of oleine,     60 per cent.\r\n  If you assume summer butter to contain of margarine,  40  “    “\r\n                                                       ---\r\n                                                       100  “    “\r\n  If the cow consume of the oleine,                     36  “    “\r\n                                                       ---\r\n  The quantity of butter will be reduced from 100 to    64  “    “\r\n\r\n  And the proportions will then be, of oleine,          40  “    “\r\n  And the proportions will then be, of margarine,       60  “    “\r\n                                                       ---\r\n                                                       100  “    “\r\n\r\nIf you supply turnips or mangel with hay, the cow will consume less of\r\nhay; you thereby substitute a material richer in sugar, etc., and poorer\r\nin oil. Each of these materials, in the quantity a cow can consume, is\r\ndeficient in the supply of albumen necessary to keep up the condition of\r\nan animal giving a full yield of milk. To effect this, recourse must be\r\nhad to artificial or concentrated substances of food, rich in albuminous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be expected, nor is it desirable, that practical farmers\r\nshould apply themselves to the attainment of proficiency in the art of\r\nchemical investigations; this is more properly the occupation of the\r\nprofessor of science. The following simple experiment, however, seems\r\nworth mentioning. On several occasions, during winter, I procured\r\nsamples of butter from my next neighbor. On placing these, with a like\r\nquantity of my own, in juxtaposition before the fire, my butter melted\r\nwith far greater rapidity--by no means an unsafe test of a greater\r\nproportion of oleine.\r\n\r\nThe chemical investigation of our natural and other grasses has hitherto\r\nscarcely had the attention which it deserves. The most valuable\r\ninformation on this subject is in the paper by Professor Way, on the\r\nnutritive and fattening properties of the grasses, in vol. xiv., p. 171,\r\nof the Royal Agricultural Society’s Journal. These grasses were nearly\r\nall analyzed at the flowering time, a stage at which no occupier of\r\ngrass-land would expect so favorable a result in fattening. We much\r\nprefer pastures with young grass not more than a few inches high,\r\nsufficient to afford a good bite. With a view to satisfy myself as to\r\nthe difference of composition of the like grasses at different stages of\r\ngrowth, I sent to Professor Way a specimen of the first crop of hay, cut\r\nin the end of June, when the grass was in the early stage of flowering,\r\nand one of aftermath, cut towards the close of September, from the same\r\nmeadow, the analyses of which I give:\r\n\r\n       HAY, FIRST CROP.        |        AFTERMATH HAY\r\n  Moisture,              12.02 | Moisture,              11.87\r\n  Albuminous matter,      9.24 | Oil and fatty matter,   6.84\r\n  Oil and fatty matter,   2.68 | Albuminous matter,      9.84\r\n  Starch, gum, sugar,    39.75 | Starch, gum, sugar,    42.25\r\n  Woody fibre,           27.41 | Woody fibre,           19.77\r\n  Mineral matter,         8.90 | Mineral matter,         9.43\r\n                       ------- |                      -------\r\n                        100.00 |                       100.00\r\n\r\nA comparison between these will show a much greater percentage of woody\r\nfibre,--27.41 in the first crop to 19.77 in the aftermath. The most\r\nremarkable difference, however, is in the proportion of oil, being 2.68\r\nin the first crop to 6.84 in the aftermath.\r\n\r\nOn inquiry from an observing tenant of a small dairy farm of mine, who\r\nhas frequently used aftermath hay, I learn that, as compared with the\r\nfirst crop, he finds it induces a greater yield of milk, but attended\r\nwith some impoverishment in the condition of the cow, and that he uses\r\nit without addition of turnips or other roots, which he gives when\r\nusing hay of the first crop--an answer quite in accordance with what\r\nmight be expected from its chemical composition.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise to be presumed that the quickness of growth will\r\nmaterially affect the composition of grasses, as well as of other\r\nvegetables. Your gardener will tell you that if radishes are slow in\r\ngrowth they will be tough and woody; that asparagus melts in eating,\r\nlike butter, and salad is crisp when grown quickly. The same effect\r\nwill, I apprehend, be found in grasses of slow growth: they will contain\r\nmore of woody fibre, with less of starch or sugar. The quality of butter\r\ngrown on poor pastures is characterized by greater solidity than on rich\r\nfeeding pastures. The cows, having to travel over more space, require a\r\ngreater supply of the elements of respiration, whilst the grasses grown\r\non these poor pastures contain, in all probability, less of these in a\r\n_digestible form_ available for respiration. The like result seems\r\nprobable as from common winter treatment--a produce of butter less in\r\nquantity, and containing a greater proportion of margarine, and a less\r\nof oleine.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that pastures vary greatly in their butter-producing\r\nproperties; there is, however, as far as I am aware, no satisfactory\r\nexplanation of this. If you watch cows on depasture, you observe them\r\nselect their own food; if you supply cows in stall alike with food, they\r\nwill also select for themselves. I give rape-cake as a mixture to all,\r\nand induce them to eat the requisite quantity; yet some will select the\r\nrape-cake first, and eat it up clean, whilst others rather neglect it\r\ntill towards the close of their meal, and then leave pieces in the\r\ntrough. Two Alderneys,--the only cows of the kind I have as yet\r\nhad,--whose butter-producing qualities are well known, are particularly\r\nfond of rape-cake, and never leave a morsel. May not these animals be\r\nprompted by their instinct to select such food as is best suited to\r\ntheir wants and propensities? If so, it seems of the greatest importance\r\nthat the dairyman should be informed of the properties of food most\r\nsuitable for his purpose, especially whilst in a stall, where they have\r\nlittle opportunity of selecting.\r\n\r\nIt appears worth the attention of our society to make inquiries as to\r\nthe localities which are known as producing milk peculiarly rich in\r\nbutter. When travelling in Germany, I well recollect being treated with\r\npeculiarly rich milk, cream, and butter, on my tour between Dresden and\r\nToplitz, at the station or resting-place on the chaussée or\r\nturnpike-road, before you descend a very steep incline to the valley in\r\nwhich Toplitz is situated. I travelled this way after an interval of\r\nseveral years, when the same treat was again offered. It was given as a\r\nrarity, and can only be accounted for by the peculiar adaptation of the\r\nherbage of the country for the production of butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF FEEDING DAIRY COWS.--Being desirous\r\nof comparing the result of my method of feeding dairy cows with the\r\nsystem usually practised in this locality, it occurred to me that, as my\r\ncows had been accustomed to savory steamed food, a change to ordinary\r\nfood would be attended with less favorable results than if they had been\r\npreviously treated in the common mode; and that, under these\r\ncircumstances, it would be better to institute comparisons with two near\r\nneighbors, Mr. Smith and Mr. Pawson, whose practice and results I had\r\nthe opportunity of inspecting.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith’s cow was of rather small frame, but noted for her usefulness\r\nas a good milker. At the time of calving her third calf; about the 12th\r\nof November, she was in good condition, and gave, soon after, seventeen\r\nquarts of milk per day. Her owner states that in the first three weeks\r\n(up to the time this comparison was begun) her condition sensibly\r\ndiminished--a result which I apprehend will be invariable with cows\r\ngiving this quantity of milk when fed on meadow hay only, with which Mr.\r\nSmith’s cow was supplied _ad libitum_, and of which she consumed\r\ntwenty-eight pounds per day. Mr. Pawson’s was a nice heifer, three years\r\nold at the time of calving her first calf, October 6th, in more than\r\nordinary condition, and gave about sixteen quarts per day. Her owner\r\nstates that on the first of January her condition was much diminished.\r\nThis is corroborated by Mr. Myers, a dealer in the village, who tells me\r\nthat, previous to her calving, he was desirous of purchasing her, and\r\nwould have given from seventeen pounds ten shillings to eighteen pounds,\r\nand describes her as being at that time full of beef. Her weight on the\r\nfirst of January, 7 cwt. 2 qrs., bespeaks her condition as much lowered.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October, and till late in November, she was turned\r\nout in the daytime to graze on aftermath, and housed during the night,\r\nwhere she was supplied with turnips. From the close of November till the\r\nfirst week in February, her food consisted of\r\n\r\n  Meadow hay of inferior quality, 18 lbs. per day.\r\n  Swedish turnips,                45  “    “   “\r\n  Ground oats,                     9  “    “   “\r\n\r\nAfter this the ground oats were discontinued, and meadow hay of good\r\nquality was given _ad libitum_, with forty-five pounds of turnips.\r\n\r\nFor comparison I selected a cow of my own, which calved about the 8th of\r\nOctober, and gave soon after eighteen quarts of milk per day; she was\r\nalso of small size. At the time of calving her condition was somewhat\r\nhigher than that of Mr. Smith’s. When the experiment was begun, on the\r\nfirst of January, no perceivable difference was found in the yield of\r\nmilk of Mr. Smith’s cow and my own, each giving fifteen and a half\r\nquarts per day.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the dates of calving of the three cows,\r\ntogether with their weights and yield of milk at the commencement and\r\ntermination of the experiment:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n                 |        |     January 1.      |      March 6.\r\n                 +--------+--------------+------+--------------+------\r\n                 |Yield at|              |      |              |\r\n                 |calving.|    Weight.   |Yield.|    Weight.   |Yield.\r\n   When calved.  +--------+----+----+----+------+----+----+----+------\r\n                 |Quarts. |Cwt.|qrs.|lbs.| Qts. |Cwt.|qrs.|lbs.| Qts.\r\n  ---------------+--------+----+----+----+------+----+----+----+------\r\n  Mr. Smith’s--  |        |    |    |    |      |    |    |    |\r\n  Nov. 12.       |   17   | 8  | 3  | 0  | 15¹⁄₂|  8 | 0  | 0  | 9¹⁄₂\r\n  Mr. Pawson’s-- |        |    |    |    |      |    |    |    |\r\n  Oct. 6.        |   16   | 7  | 2  | 0  | 12   |  7 | 1  | 0  | 6¹⁄₄\r\n  My own--Oct. 8.|   18   | 9  | 3  | 0  | 15¹⁄₂| 10 | 1  | 0  |12¹⁄₂\r\n  ---------------+--------+----+----+----+------+----+----+----+------\r\n\r\nMr. Smith’s cow lost in weight in nine weeks 84 pounds, being 9¹⁄₃\r\npounds per week, with an average yield of 12¹⁄₂ quarts per day.

This loss, together with the diminished yield\r\nof milk, occurred almost wholly after the oats had been withdrawn; her\r\nweight on the 6th of February being still 7 cwt. 2 qrs., and her yield\r\nof milk 11 quarts per day.\r\n\r\nMy cow has gained in the nine weeks 56 lbs., being 6¹⁄₄ pounds per week,\r\nwith an average yield of 14 quarts, the diminution being regular.\r\nJanuary 1st, 15¹⁄₂; Feb. 4th, 14; March 4th, 12¹⁄₂; making an average\r\nyield of 14 quarts per day.

Towards the close of September green rape\r\nwas substituted for the mown grass, with the same allowance of steamed\r\nmixture; from the 8th of October, when they were wholly housed, they\r\nwere supplied with steamed food _ad libitum_ three times per day. After\r\neach meal ten to twelve pounds of green rape-plant were given, and nine\r\npounds of hay per day till November; from that time steamed food with\r\ncabbages or kohl rabi till the early part or February, when mangold\r\nwurzel was substituted. It will be observed that I give hay and roots in\r\nlimited quantities, and the steamed food _ad libitum_. I prefer this to\r\napportioning the cake and other concentrated food in equal quantities to\r\neach, as this steamed mixture contains more of the elements essential to\r\nmilk, and each cow is thus at liberty to satisfy her requirements with\r\nit. Nos. 2 and 4, which have given the greatest quantity of milk, have\r\neaten more than their share; whilst No. 1, which has given the least\r\nmilk, has scarcely eaten more than half the quantity of steamed mixture\r\nconsumed by 2 or 4. The yield of milk and the live weights on the 4th of\r\nFebruary and the 4th of March scarcely vary. During February thirty-four\r\npounds of mangold were substituted for kohl rabi; with this change the\r\ncows became mere relaxed. My experience in weighing, extending over\r\nseveral years, has shown me that when animals, from change of food,\r\nbecome more relaxed or more costive, their weighings in the former state\r\ndenote less, whilst in the latter they denote more, than their actual\r\ngain in condition. I have known instances in which a month’s weighing,\r\naccompanied by relaxation, has shown no gain, whilst, with restored\r\nconsistency, the gain doubled.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to examine the materials of food, their composition, and\r\nthe probable changes they undergo in the animal economy.\r\n\r\n  _Quantity and description of food supplied to six cows during\r\n  twenty-seven and a

own produce, or such extra\r\nmaterials as I usually purchase, have been made by Professor Way; for\r\nother materials I have had recourse to a very useful compilation by Mr.\r\nHemming (vol. xiii., p. 449, of the Society’s Journal), and to Morton’s\r\n“Cyclopædia of Agriculture.” The analysis of straw is that of oat-straw;\r\nthat of green food is derived from the analysis of rape-plant, cabbages,\r\nand kohl rabi. During February and March I have been using wheat and\r\nbarley straw with marigold, and, as these materials contain less oil, I\r\ngive in the steamed food three ounces of linseed-oil per day to each\r\nanimal. For the composition of milk I adopt that by Haidlen, whose\r\nmethod of analysis is reputed to be the most accurate, the proportion of\r\nbutter in my milk being this season very similar to that given by him.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this is the gross return for twenty-seven and\r\none third weeks from the time of calving, from which will have to be\r\ndeducted expense of attendance, etc.\r\n\r\n                                                          £.  _s._  _d._\r\n  The materials used for food are found to have cost      70    0     9\r\n\r\n  The value of these materials as manure consists of 888\r\n  lbs. nitrogen = 1061 lbs. ammonia, at 6_d._,            26   10     6\r\n  Phosphoric acid and potash,                              9   15     4\r\n                                                         --------------\r\n  Value of food if employed as manure,                   £36    5    10\r\n\r\n  The 16,072 quarts of milk, at 2_d._ per quart for new\r\n  milk, at which price it enters largely into\r\n  consumption as food for man, amount to                £133   18     8\r\n                                        £.  _s._  _d._\r\n  The nitrogen in the milk 316 lbs. =\r\n  ammonia 378 lbs., at 6_d._ per lb.,    9    9     0\r\n  Phosphoric acid in ditto. 45¹⁄₂\r\n  lbs., at 1¹⁄₂_d._ per lb.,             0    5     8\r\n                                        -------------\r\n                                                          £9   14     8\r\n\r\nFrom these statements it will be seen that materials used as _food for\r\ncattle_ represent double the value they would do if used for manure,\r\nwhilst that portion converted into _food fitted for the use of man_\r\nrepresents a value thirteen to fourteen times greater than it would as\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nIt then appears clear that it is for the feeder’s profit to use his\r\nproduce as much as possible as food for cattle, with the view to convert\r\nit with the utmost economy into food for man, and thus _increase rather\r\nthan enrich his manure-heap_.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of caseine in milk is based upon the supposition that my\r\nmilk is equal in its proportion of that element to that analyzed by\r\nHaidlen. Several analyses by other chemists show a less percentage, 4 to\r\n4.50. As my cows are adequately supplied with albuminous matter, I have\r\na right to presume on their milk being rich in caseine.\r\n\r\nThe loss of nitrogen by perspiration, 150.65 lbs., is nearly 17 per\r\ncent. Boussingault found a loss of 13.50 of nitrogen in a cow giving\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n  The abstraction of nitrogen in the milk is computed at  £.  _s._  _d._\r\n  316 lbs., value,                                         9    9     0\r\n  The abstraction of phosphoric acid in the milk is\r\n  computed at 48¹⁄₂ lbs.,                                  0    5     8\r\n\r\nEither the rape-cake or bran alone suffices for the restoration of the\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe amount of phosphoric acid in the manure is 393 pounds, being about\r\nsixteen per cent. of the whole ash or mineral matter. The ash of meadow\r\nhay contains about 14 per cent., that of rape-cake 30 per cent., bran 50\r\nper cent., malt-combs 25 per cent., and turnips, &c., 10 per cent. of\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nThe amount of potash in the excrement is 616 pounds, being about 25 per\r\ncent. of the whole ash or mineral matter. The ash of meadow hay contains\r\nabout 20 per cent.; rape-cake, 21 per cent.; malt-combs, 37 per cent.;\r\nturnips (various), 44 per cent.; from which it may be inferred that the\r\nsample of excrement sent to Professor Way for analysis did not contain\r\nmore than a fair proportion of these ingredients.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the quantity of excrement, the contents of the tanks into\r\nwhich the cows had dropped their solid and liquid excrement during five\r\nweeks were weighed, and found to be 500 cwt. 2 qrs. 0 lbs, from 18 cows,\r\nbeing 88 lbs. per cow per day. The sample for analysis was taken from\r\nthat which the cows had deposited within the preceding 24 hours. This\r\nwas collected in the mud-cart, well blended, and sent off quite fresh.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently proved, by the experience of this district, that 20\r\npounds of meadow hay suffice for the maintenance of a cow of fair size\r\nin store condition; a like result is stated to be obtained from 120\r\npounds of turnips per day. The six cows will have then required, during\r\nthe 27¹⁄₃ weeks, for their maintenance, only\r\n\r\n  ------------------+------+-------+-------------+------+----+------\r\n                    |      |       |             |Albu- |    |\r\n                    |      | Total |             |minous|    |Starch,\r\n          Per day.  |Weeks.|Weight.|             | mat. |Oil.|  &c.\r\n  ------------------+------+-------+-------------+------+----+------\r\n  lbs.|             |      | lbs.  |             | lbs. |lbs.|lbs.\r\n  120 |of hay or for| 27¹⁄₃| 22,960|containing of| 2127 | 616|9130\r\n  150 |of turnips,  |      |       |             |      |    |\r\n      |or for       | 27¹⁄₃|137,760|    “      “ | 2295 | 306|9100\r\n  ----+-------------+------+-------+-------------+------+----+------\r\n\r\nThey will further have required adequate food--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+-------+------\r\n                                       | Albumi-|       |\r\n                                       |  nous  |       |Starch\r\n                                       | matter,|       | and\r\n                                       |fibrin, |  Oil  | sugar\r\n                                       |  and   |  and  |  of\r\n                                       |caseine.|butter.| milk.\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+-------+------\r\n  For the production of                |  2,116 | 1,235 | 1,894\r\n  And for maintenance by turnips,      |  2,295 |   306 | 9,100\r\n                                       +--------+-------+------\r\n                                       |  4,411 | 1,541 |10,994\r\n  The food supplied is computed to have|        |       |\r\n  contained                            |  5,459 | 1,345 |15,664\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+-------+------\r\n\r\nI omit the minerals, which are observed to be in excess of the\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of a fair-sized cow, for one day, in a normal state,\r\nthe following elements seem adequate:\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-----+----+-------+-----+------------\r\n                         |     |    |       |     |  Mineral\r\n                         |     |    |       |     |ingredients.\r\n                         |Albu-|    |Starch,|     | Phosphoric\r\n                         | men.|Oil.|  &c.  |Lime.|   acid.\r\n  -----------------------+-----+----+-------+-----+------------\r\n  In  20 lbs. of hay,    | 1.85|.536|  7.95 | .90 |   1.11\r\n  In 120  “   “  turnips,| 1.98|.26 |  7.82 | .97 |   1.9\r\n  -----------------------+-----+----+-------+-----+------------\r\n\r\nWhen cows are in milk, there occurs a much greater activity of the\r\nfunctions; they eat and drink more, evacuate more excrement, and, in all\r\nprobability, spend considerably more food in respiration. Whilst the\r\n17.60 lbs. per day dry matter in 20 lbs. of hay are found adequate for\r\nthe maintenance of a cow in a store state, the six cows in milk have\r\neaten on the average 21.37 lbs. solid matter per day during the 27¹⁄₃\r\nweeks. When I have fattened cattle together with a number of milch cows\r\nof similar size, which gave on an average eight quarts of milk per day,\r\nthe whole being fed with moist steamed food, and receiving the same\r\nallowance of green food, I have found the fattening cattle refuse water,\r\nwhilst the milch cows on the average drank upwards of 40 pounds per day\r\nof water given separately. The eight quarts of milk contain only about\r\n17.58 lbs. of water; still, in several analyses of excrement, I have\r\nnoticed little difference in the percentage of moisture in that from the\r\nfattening animals as compared with that from cows giving milk.\r\n\r\nThese facts would seem to show that upwards of 20 lbs. more water were\r\ngiven off from the lungs and pores of the skin of a milking than of a\r\nfattening animal.\r\n\r\nThe excrement of the six milch cows, 88 lbs. per day on the average, is\r\nfound to contain of nitrogen 36, equal to that in 2.25 lbs. of albumen;\r\nwhilst 1.85 of albumen in the 20 lbs. of hay is found adequate for\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the supply of the food to the six milch cows with their\r\nrequirements and production, there seems an excess in the albuminous\r\nmatter, a deficiency in the oil for the fat and butter, an excess in the\r\nstarch, &c. Taking, however, the increased activity of the animal\r\nfunctions, and consequent consumption of food by the milch cow, I am not\r\nencouraged to lower my standard of food. That it has sufficed is\r\nabundantly proved, as each of the six cows under observation has gained\r\nin condition during 27¹⁄₃ weeks.\r\n\r\nMy observations on nutrition tend to the conclusion that if you supply\r\nanimals with starch, sugar, &c., to satisfy their requirements for\r\nrespiration, you enable them to convert the oil of their food into\r\nbutter or fat to such extent as their particular organism is fitted for\r\neffecting it.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March I purchased Mr. Smith’s cow (see p. 392) for twelve\r\npounds ten shillings, being more than her market value, for the purpose\r\nof trying her on my food; her yield of milk had then diminished to 8\r\nquarts per day. On the 31st of March, four weeks from the former\r\nweighing, and nineteen days after being treated with my food, her yield\r\nof milk had increased to 9¹⁄₂ quarts per day, and her weight to 8 cwt. 1\r\nqr., being 28 lbs. increase.\r\n\r\nMr. Pawson’s cow, which was continued on the same food, namely, meadow\r\nhay _ad libitum_, and a more limited supply of turnips, reduced her\r\nyield of milk to less than 5 quarts per day, without alteration in her\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nMy cow first placed on trial with those of Mr. Smith and Mr. Pawson gave\r\na yield of milk of 12 quarts per day, and gained 28 lbs. in the four\r\nweeks, her weight on the 31st of March being 10 cwt. 2 qrs.\r\n\r\nThe weight and the yield of milk of the six, on the 31st of March, were:\r\n\r\n  ----------------+-------------+--------+-------------+--------+------\r\n                  |             |Yield of|             |Yield of|Gain\r\n                  |             |  milk  |             |  milk  |in 4\r\n                  |   March 4.  |per day.|  March 31.  |per day.|weeks.\r\n  ----------------+-------------+--------+-------------+--------+------\r\n                  |cwt. qr. lbs.|quarts. |cwt. qr. lbs.| quarts.|lbs.\r\n  Weight of No. 1.| 10   0  26  |   8    | 10   3    0 |   8.9  | 58\r\n    “    “  “   2.| 11   1   0  |  14    | 11   3    0 |  14.9  | 56\r\n    “    “  “   4.| 10   0   0  |  14¹⁄₂ | 10   1    0 |  13    | 28\r\n    “    “  “   6.| 10   3   0  |  14    | 11   2    0 |  12    | 84\r\n    “    “  “   7.| 11   0   0  |  10    | 11   3    0 |  10    | 84\r\n    “    “  “  11.|  9   2   0  |  11    | 10   1    0 |  12    | 84\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn referring to the previous weighing, there was little or no gain from\r\nFeb. 4th to March 4th, the cows being at that time in a somewhat more\r\nrelaxed state. During March they wholly regained their consistency. The\r\ngain shown in the weighing, March 31, by the six cows, appears therefore\r\nunusually great. It should, however, be computed as made during the\r\neight weeks from Feb. 4th to March 31, being with an average yield of\r\nnearly 12 quarts (11.66) per day each, at the rate of 8¹⁄₆ lbs. each per\r\nweek on the average.\r\n\r\nNo. 11, it will be observed, is stated as giving more milk on the 31st\r\nthan on the 4th of March. It occasionally happens that cows drop their\r\nyield of milk for a day or two, and then regain it, especially when in\r\nuse. The whole of these six cows were kept free from calf till February,\r\nwhen Nos. 2 and 4 were sent to bull. I had some hesitation in regard to\r\nNo. 4, from her having suffered from pleuro. Her milk, tested by a\r\nlactometer, denoted a less than average proportion of cream; still, in\r\nquantity, and keeping up its yield for a length of time, being of more\r\nthan ordinary capability; I decided to retain her.\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 7, which are giving respectively 8 and 10 quarts per day, are\r\nin a state of fatness; they will probably be sold in June as prime fat,\r\nwhen their yield of milk will probably be 6 and 8 quarts per day each.\r\nThey may be expected to fetch twenty pounds to twenty-three pounds. No.\r\n6 is also in a state of forwardness. No. 11, which suffered considerably\r\nfrom pleuro, is in comparatively lower condition.\r\n\r\nDuring the season from the close of October to the close of January, I\r\navoid purchasing near-calving cows, which are then unusually dear, my\r\nreplenishments being made with cows giving a low range of milk, and\r\nintended for fattening. I find them more profitable than those which are\r\nquite dry. The present season I had additional grounds for abstaining\r\nfrom buying high-priced cows, from the recent presence of pleuro.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March I had occasion to purchase a calving cow, which was\r\nreported to have calved on the 28th of February. Her weight on the 4th\r\nof March was 9 cwt. 1 qr. I supplied her with 35 lbs. of mangold, and\r\nhay _ad libitum_., of which she ate 22 lbs. per day. The greatest yield\r\nshe attained was somewhat more than 13 quarts per day. On the 31st of\r\nMarch her weight was 9 cwt., being a loss of 28 lbs. in four weeks. Her\r\nyield of milk had diminished to 11¹⁄₄ quarts per day. A week after this\r\nher milk, during six days, was kept apart, and averaged 10 quarts per\r\nday; being at first rather more, at the close rather less, than this.\r\nThe cream produced from these 10 quarts was 9 pints, the butter 63 oz.\r\nThe butter from each quart of cream was 14 oz. The proportion of butter\r\nto milk was 63 oz. from 60 quarts--rather more than 1 oz. per quart.\r\n\r\nAn equal quantity of milk from a cow (calved Oct. 8th) treated with\r\nsteamed food, and set apart for comparison, gave less than 7 pints of\r\ncream, which produced 79 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\nIn quality and agreeableness the butter from steamed food and cake was\r\ndecidedly superior to that from hay and mangold.\r\n\r\nMr. Stansfeld, of Chertsey, has supplied me with the following\r\ninteresting particulars of two Alderney cows which were treated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFrom Dec. 1st to Jan 15th, with Swedes and meadow hay.\r\n\r\nFrom Jan. 15th to Feb. 17th, pulped and fermented Swedes, meadow hay,\r\nand 3 lbs. rape-cake, 2 lbs. bean-meal, 2 lbs. bran, 2 lbs. malt-combs.\r\n\r\nFrom Feb. 17th to May 1st, 5 lbs. rape-cake, 2 lbs. bran, 2 lbs.\r\nmalt-combs.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nDecember 1st to January 15th, yield of butter from each quart of cream,\r\n10³⁄₄ oz.\r\n\r\nJanuary 15th to February 17th, yield of butter from each quart of cream,\r\n14 oz.\r\n\r\nFebruary 17th to May 1st, yield of butter from each quart of cream,\r\n18²⁄₃ oz.\r\n\r\nThe yield of butter in proportion to milk, Dec. 1st to Jan. 15th, is\r\ndescribed as unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe yield of butter in proportion to milk, Feb. 17th to May, as 2 oz.\r\nper quart, which is their maximum proportion.\r\n\r\nSoon after calving the two cows gave 18 quarts of milk per day; on the\r\n15th of May, 15 quarts per day.\r\n\r\nMr. Stansfeld has completely satisfied himself that by the process of\r\nfermentation the turnip loses its disagreeable taste, and that his\r\nbutter is of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nIf I take the supply of turnips, 120 lbs. per day, as requisite for the\r\nmaintenance only of the cow, the nutritive elements will be:\r\n\r\n                                 Albumen.

Her produce had lessened to 10\r\nquarts per day; her production of butter was 10.50 oz. per day, or of\r\npure oil about 9 oz.; for the supply of oil the aftermath hay alone\r\nwould be much more than adequate.\r\n\r\nOn examining the adequacy of the food for the supply of albumen for the\r\ncaseine,\r\n\r\n                                                         lbs.\r\n  I find this to be,                                     3.08\r\n  I assume that in 120 lbs. of turnips, as required for\r\n  maintenance, in a normal state,                        1.98\r\n                                                         ----\r\n                                                         1.10\r\n\r\nWhich, according to Haidlen’s analysis, will be adequate to the supply\r\nof 8.60 quarts per day. The supply of mineral substances is in excess.\r\n\r\nThe cow, under this treatment, gave,\r\n\r\n  Soon after calving, fully            13     quarts per day.\r\n  Five weeks after calving,            11¹⁄₄    “     “   “\r\n  In less than 8 weeks after calving,   9       “     “   “\r\n\r\nAnd with this there occurred also a loss of weight.\r\n\r\nWe find this cow supplied with food amply rich in every element suited\r\nto her wants and purposes, with the exception of the nitrogenous\r\nprinciple only, lowering her condition, and likewise her yield of milk,\r\ntill it approaches a quantity for which her food enables her to supply a\r\ndue proportion of caseine.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th of April, the cow’s yield being reduced to 9 quarts per\r\nday, her food was changed to steamed mixture. Soon after this her yield\r\nincreased to 11 quarts per day. Her weight, April 28th, 9 cwt.; May\r\n16th, 9 cwt. 14 lbs. yield of milk, 11 quarts.\r\n\r\nI now introduce the dairy statistics of Mr. Alcock, of Aireville,\r\nSkipton, who has for some time been practising my method of treatment,\r\nwith such modifications as are suited to his circumstances.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season, Mr. Alcock’s food consisted of mangold, of\r\nwhich he gave 20 lbs. per day to each, uncooked, together with steamed\r\nfood _ad libitum_, consisting of wheat and bean straw, and shells of\r\noats.\r\n\r\n  Carob bean and Indian meal, for each,  3     lbs. per day\r\n  Bran and malt-combs,                   1      “    “   “\r\n  Bean-meal,                             3¹⁄₂   “    “   “\r\n  Rape-cake,[5]                          3      “    “   “\r\n                                        ------\r\n        Of extra food,                  11¹⁄₄\r\n\r\n  [5] The rape-cake used by Mr. Alcock was of foreign manufacture,\r\n  evidently rich in oil, but containing mustard, and on this account\r\n  supplied in less proportion.\r\n\r\nFrom March 19, when his store of mangold was exhausted, he increased his\r\nsupply of Indian meal to 4 lbs. per day, and omitted the carob bean.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of January, Mr. Alcock obtained from 759 quarts of milk\r\n1323 oz. of butter, being from each 16 quarts 26⁵⁄₈ oz.; during February\r\nand March, from 7368 quarts of milk 12,453 oz. of butter, or from each\r\n16 quarts fully 27 oz.: so that rather less than 9¹⁄₂ quarts of milk\r\nhave produced 16 oz. of butter. The average produce from each quart of\r\ncream was 20¹⁄₂ oz.\r\n\r\nMr. Alcock fattens his cows whilst giving milk, and sells them whilst\r\ngiving 4 to 6 quarts per day. He quite agrees with me that it is far\r\nmore profitable to buy far-milked cows for fattening; and obtains, from\r\na change to his food, 2 to 3 quarts per day more than the cow had given\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Alcock’s cream is not so rich as what I have described on pp.\r\n377 and 378, it is more than ordinarily so. His mode of separating his\r\nmilk from his cream differs from my own, his milk being set up in leaden\r\nvessels, from which, on the cream being formed, the old milk is drawn,\r\nby taking a plug from a hollow tube, with perforated holes in the centre\r\nof the vessel. To this difference I am disposed in some degree to\r\nattribute the less richness of Mr. Alcock’s cream. On examining, the\r\ncream with a spoon, after the dairy-keeper had drawn off the milk, I\r\nobserved some portion of milk, which would have escaped through my\r\nperforated skimmer.\r\n\r\nMr. Alcock’s proportion of butter from milk, which is the matter of\r\npractical importance, is greater than what I have shown on a preceding\r\npage, being from each 16 quarts of milk 27 oz. of butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF BUTTER.--In January, 1857, samples of about 56 oz. each, of\r\nbutter of my own, and also of Mr. Alcock’s, were sent to the laboratory\r\nof Messrs. Price & Co.’s candle-works, at Belmont.\r\n\r\nMy butter was found to consist of (taking the pure fat only),\r\n\r\n  Hard fat, mostly margarine, fusible at 950°,  45.9\r\n  Liquid, or oleine,                            54.1\r\n                                               -----\r\n                                               100.0\r\n\r\nMr. Alcock’s,\r\n\r\n  Hard fat, mostly margarine, fusible at 10°,   36.0\r\n  Liquid, or oleine,                            64.0\r\n                                               -----\r\n                                               100.0\r\n\r\nFor these analyses of butter the agricultural public is indebted to the\r\ngood offices of Mr. George Wilson, director of Messrs. Price & Co.’s\r\nmanufactory. It will be observed that Mr. Alcock’s milk is richer in\r\nbutter and that his butter is also richer in proportion of oleine to\r\nmargarine than my own.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thompson (“Elements of Agricultural Chemistry,” 6th edition,\r\np. 317) states that winter butter consists more of solid, and summer\r\nmore of liquid or oleine fat.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of butter made in Vosges gives:\r\n\r\n                             Summer.  Winter.\r\n  Solid or margarine fat,     40       65\r\n  Liquid (or oleine) fat,     60       35\r\n                             ---      ---\r\n                             100      100\r\n\r\nIn Lehmann’s “Physiological Chemistry” (Leipsic edition, vol. ii., p.\r\n329), an analysis of butter by Bromus gives:\r\n\r\n  Margarine,            68\r\n  Oleine,               30\r\n  Special butter-oil,    2\r\n                       ---\r\n                       100\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that my butter may be classed as summer butter, and\r\nthat Mr. Alcock’s is the richest in the proportion of oleine. Both were\r\nproduced in the month of January.\r\n\r\nThese results are important, and completely establish the conclusion I\r\nhad previously formed, that the quantity and quality of butter depend\r\nessentially on the food and treatment; and that by suitable means you\r\ncan produce _as much and as rich butter in winter as in summer_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aiton’s

Inconsistent spelling, hyphenation, formatting and lay-out in the\r\n  source document have been retained, except as mentioned below. The use\r\n  of “ in lieu of the ditto sign „ has been retained as well.\r\n\r\n  p. vii, ... which I have translated from the German: several words\r\n  (including names) are given in their German, not the usual Dutch or\r\n  English, spelling.\r\n\r\n  p.96, as at M M, Fig. 30: there is just a single M visible in the\r\n  illustration.\r\n\r\n  p. 125, second table: presumably the rows correspond to the rows in\r\n  the first table on this page.\r\n\r\n  p. 126: White Silician Beet: possibly an error for White Sicilian or\r\n  White Silesian Beet.\r\n\r\n  p. 192, The nutritive equivalent ... one pound of hay: as printed in\r\n  the source document. The comparison between hay and potatoes is off by\r\n  a factor 100 (see also the table on page 126).\r\n\r\n  p. 216, table: the addition results in 1000.4, not in exactly 1000.\r\n\r\n  p. 217 and p. 241: The poem is from The Farmer’s Boy by Robert\r\n  Bloomfield (1800).\r\n\r\n  p. 329, crooked Rhine: this should read Crooked Rhine, Crooked being\r\n  part of the river’s name (Kromme Rijn).\r\n\r\n  p. 330, Commissions’ cheese: Commission’s cheese would have been a\r\n  more accurate translation.\r\n\r\n  p. 337, ... as appears in the press: probably an error for ... as\r\n  appears in the cut (or similar).\r\n\r\n  p. 347, 536,834,830 pounds: the amount appears to be a factor 10 too\r\n  high.\r\n\r\n  p. 353, tournesol: the colouring agent is more commonly called\r\n  turnsole.\r\n\r\n  p. 401, table on maintenance requirements: the text and the table\r\n  mention different amounts of foodstuffs; the calculation from daily to\r\n  total use of turnips seems to be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made:\r\n\r\n  Footnotes and illustrations have bee moved out of text paragraphs;\r\n  some tables have been re-aranged.\r\n\r\n  Non-English words have not been corrected, unless listed below.\r\n\r\n  Some obvious minor typographical and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected silently.\r\n\r\n  The Table of Contents was not present in the source document, and has\r\n  been created for this e-text.\r\n\r\n  The source document contained two illustrations each numbered Fig. 56,\r\n  Fig. 57 and Fig. 58. The first occurrences of these and the references\r\n  thereto have been renumbered Fig. 56a, Fig. 57a and Fig. 58a, the\r\n  second instances and references thereto Fig. 56b, Fig. 57b and Fig.\r\n  58b.\r\n\r\n  In some places the ditto sign (in this book “) has been replaced by\r\n  the dittoed text.\r\n\r\n  p. 212: “ inserted before To one hundred and twelve pounds ...\r\n\r\n  p. 243: “ removed from before The evening’s and morning’s milk\r\n\r\n  p. 393, table: Parson changed to Pawson\r\n\r\n  p. 401, table on maintenance requirements: header Per day moved to\r\n  include the first column; header lbs. added to last three columns.",
