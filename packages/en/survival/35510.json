This book dealt in a very practical manner with problems with\r\nwhich the industry had to contend. A second edition was subsequently\r\npublished. Both editions are now out of print. The present opportunity was\r\ntherefore taken to revise the original work, with the result that it has\r\nbeen enlarged and practically rewritten. The information given is brought\r\nup-to-date, and covers the whole process of production, commencing with the\r\nplanting of the tree, passing on to the collection, coagulation, and curing\r\nof the rubber, and concluding with the packing for export. In the course of\r\nhis work for the Association, Mr. Morgan carried out a great deal of\r\nindustrial research in rubber production, including lengthy experiments on\r\ntapping, the use of different coagulants and different conditions of\r\ncoagulation, and also on varying modes of rolling, drying, and smoking\r\nrubber. He also went very fully into the types of construction and details\r\nof the machinery and buildings employed on estates.\r\n\r\nMuch of this valuable work has escaped notice, owing to its having been\r\npublished in reports with limited circulation. Also a great deal of\r\ninformation was supplied to planters in a quiet and unobtrusive fashion, in\r\ninterviews, visits to estates, and on other similar occasions. The\r\nknowledge and experience thus accumulated has been embodied in the present\r\nvolume. The subject-matter should interest not only those actually engaged\r\nin rubber planting, but those otherwise directly or indirectly connected\r\nwith the industry, such as importers, brokers, and particularly the rubber\r\nmanufacturers in this country and in America. My experience has been that\r\nmanufacturers as a whole have but a vague idea as to the methods employed\r\nin the preparation of plantation rubber, and this work provides them with\r\nthe opportunity of obtaining an insight into the actual operations on the\r\nestates. It is most desirable that a closer bond should unite the\r\nplantation and manufacturing rubber industries. Such a result is best\r\npromoted by a better understanding of the problems with which each is\r\nconfronted. Perhaps I may go so far as to suggest that some leading\r\nscientific officer in the employment of one of the large manufacturing\r\nconcerns may take in hand a book which will give the planters the\r\nequivalent of information in regard to the manufacturing industry which the\r\nplanters are now offering to the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe photographs in the earlier part of the book will give the layman some\r\nconception of the enormous amount of labour that must be expended in the\r\nopening up, planting, trenching, and weeding the plantations which have\r\nreplaced the virgin jungle. The authors are indebted for most of these\r\nphotographs to Mr. H. Sutcliffe, one of the mycologists of the Rubber\r\nGrowers' Association. The pictures of spotless coagulating tanks and tiled\r\nverandahs regularly hosed down will indicate the cleanliness necessary for\r\nthe preparation of the beautifully clean sheet and crepe rubber which\r\nbecame available with the advent of plantation rubber. These results are\r\nlargely due to the work of Sidney Morgan and his colleagues, on whom the\r\nplanters have relied for technical guidance and advice.\r\n\r\nAs regards my own contribution this is confined to a general outline of the\r\nsubject. I have, therefore, omitted reference to a number of matters which\r\nwould have been dealt with in detail had space permitted. The information\r\ngiven is based on researches on vulcanisation carried out for the Rubber\r\nGrowers' Association by the writer over a period of nine or ten years. It\r\nwas not found practicable to give detailed references in all cases. The\r\nreports on which the conclusions are based will, however, be found among\r\nthe regular quarterly reports made by the writer for the Association up to\r\nJune, 1919. Subsequent reports have been published in the Monthly Bulletin\r\nof the Rubber Growers' Association. We are indebted to the Association for\r\npermission to publish details from these reports, and also for the use made\r\nof numerous earlier reports published both in London and in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I\r\n  _FIELD OPERATIONS_\r\n\r\n                                                                      PAGE\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n  PLANTING\r\n\r\n

Looking at the matter broadly,\r\nhowever, it must be acknowledged that the pioneers, wrong though they may\r\nhave been on some points, did remarkably well, considering that there\r\nexisted no real knowledge on the subject and that the methods employed were\r\nperforce of an empirical nature. Although we know a little more concerning\r\nthe scientific aspects of rubber planting, the sum total of that knowledge\r\ndoes not justify any drastic criticism of the methods employed by our\r\npredecessors. In fact, although we may be of opinion that on general lines\r\nthere is little now to be learned regarding the planting of _Hevea\r\nBrasiliensis_, our present knowledge does not preclude the possibility that\r\nfuture investigations may bring against us charges similar to those\r\nsometimes levelled at the earlier planters.\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the present volume is that of the preparation of rubber\r\nfor the market. Hence it is not proposed to deal in detail with the work\r\nattaching to the opening and development of rubber estates. For this the\r\nreader is referred to the literature dealing specifically with rubber\r\nplanting. Certain points in connection with planting may advantageously be\r\ntreated in a general way according to modern knowledge, and of these it is\r\nproposed to discuss a few in the following pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEEDS, SHOWING VARIABLE SIZE, SHAPE, AND MARKING.]\r\n\r\nSEEDS.--The view is now generally held that many areas were planted from\r\nseed which was not collected in a discriminate manner; and that probably\r\nthe comparatively low yields obtained on areas of some estates may be due\r\nto the employment of seed from a poor strain. To be able to decide whether\r\nsuch explanation fits the case demands a full knowledge of all the possible\r\nfactors governing the question of yields. It may, or may not, be a fact\r\nthat seed from a poor strain is wholly or partially accountable for low\r\nyields; but whatever the degree in which the seed influences the result, it\r\nis an axiom that to obtain the best results in all planting industries a\r\nmost judicious selection of seed should be made. In short, seed obtained\r\nfrom good-yielding specimens by selective treatment will eventually produce\r\nprogeny of good-yielding strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FELLING LIGHT (SECONDARY) JUNGLE.]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of these principles as applied to the planting of _H.\r\nBrasiliensis_ has focussed recent attention upon the desirability of\r\nplanting nurseries with seeds obtained from those trees which are known to\r\nbe good producers of latex of normal consistency. It does not follow that\r\nthe tree of most rapid growth and development is necessarily the best\r\nyielder; such is often not the case. In the matter of selection, therefore,\r\none has to take other standards than that of size; and the issue is\r\nnarrowed chiefly to a consideration of the yields of latex given by\r\nindividual trees. It has been found by various experimenters that there is\r\nno necessity to proceed to such a refinement as the determination of the\r\nactual weight of rubber yielded. The dry rubber content of latices from the\r\nsame trees is found to be so comparatively regular, allowing for climatic\r\nchanges, that it is sufficient for the purposes of selection to measure the\r\nvolumes of latex yielded by individual trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEEDLING, SHOWING ROOT-SYSTEM WITH SEED STILL ATTACHED.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the industry is so young that the question of seed selection\r\nyet awaits study. The task presents certain practical difficulties, and\r\nwould be by no means so easy to control as in the case of seed selection\r\nfrom other plants. It will be obvious that several generations of trees\r\nraised from selected seed would have to be under observation before any\r\nsound deductions could be made from statistics obtained in the course of\r\nthe work. Thus the problem of seed-selection as it concerns the\r\nestablishment of a high-yielding strain would involve many years of\r\nobservation on the part of a trained man. Unfortunately neither the man nor\r\nthe facilities for such experimental work exist at the present moment in\r\nthe Federated Malay States. On the scientific side the industry is\r\nincommensurably staffed, and most of the workers' time is occupied with\r\nroutine work connected with estate practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW CLEARING.\r\n\r\nIn the middle distance, felled trees awaiting burning; in the foreground, a\r\nflat and wet area with main drainage outlined.\r\n\r\n(_By courtesy of the manager of Membakut Estate, British North Borneo._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL YOUNG CLEARING, AGED ABOUT THREE YEARS, PLANTED ON\r\nVIRGIN SOIL. ORIGINAL JUNGLE TIMBER SLOWLY ROTTING.]\r\n\r\nSELECTION.--It is possible, however, that the question of strain\r\nimprovement will be solved in another manner than that of successive\r\nbreeding from the seeds of high-yielding trees. Such investigatory work is\r\nnow occupying the attention of scientific organisations in the East, and\r\ncredit is due to the stations in Java which have begun experimental work in\r\nthis direction. In brief, the scheme may be outlined as follows. Trees\r\nknown to be uniformly good yielders are kept under observation, and the\r\nseeds gathered carefully. These seeds are germinated in a special nursery,\r\nand the best-grown seedlings are selected for further operations. At a\r\ncertain stage a bud is taken from a high-yielding parent tree and grafted\r\nupon the stem of the seedling. When this has \"struck\" the original head of\r\nthe seedling is removed. This ensures that one has in the seedling both the\r\nstem and future branch system of the same strain as the parent\r\nhigh-yielding trees. It is possible to go a step farther, and by certain\r\nprocesses induce a new root system to grow above the existing roots, which\r\nare then removed. One is then able to guarantee that the roots, stem, and\r\nbranches will be of the original high-yielding strain. An objection\r\nsometimes made against the third operation of inducing a new root system is\r\nthat the original tap-root is removed and that the subsequent system\r\nconsists only of laterals. Against this argument may be quoted the observed\r\nfact that in actual development any one of the laterals may under such\r\ncircumstances function eventually as a tap-root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIGHT JUNGLE.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this system of propagation receives the approval of\r\ninvestigators, and removes the objections which may be advanced against the\r\ndevelopment of a scheme entirely founded upon successive breedings from\r\nselected seed. The course of the investigations, also, are thereby\r\nshortened considerably. Care must be exercised in the work of obtaining and\r\ngrafting the buds, but it has now been proved that by exercising reasonable\r\nprecautions which are not beyond the intelligence and ability of\r\nsubordinates, an extremely high percentage of success can be attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DENSE JUNGLE.]\r\n\r\nUntil such time as this process becomes practicable the inception of a\r\nplanted area must follow the lines usually adopted.\r\n\r\nNURSERIES.--The usual practice is to obtain seeds from some estate which\r\nhas a reputation for good yields and for exercising care in the gathering\r\nand shipping of seeds. The seed is planted in specially prepared beds, and\r\nthe percentage of germination noted for future reference. The plants should\r\nbe tended carefully, and close observation made for the detection of\r\ndisease or pests. It is not uncommon to find that owing to lack of care in\r\nthe preparation of the seed-bed, the young plants are attacked by disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEARING READY FOR PLANTING.\r\n\r\nSurface timber removed, but stumps remaining.]\r\n\r\nSTUMPS.--At a stage, varying according to the requirements of the estate,\r\nwhen the plants are from twelve to eighteen months old, they are lifted\r\nfrom the earth. The roots and head are cut off, and the \"stump\" is ready\r\nfor immediate planting in the field. Naturally any appreciable delay in\r\nplanting, or unfavourable weather conditions, will militate against the\r\nchances of successful \"striking\"; and it is not uncommon to find that a\r\ncertain number of \"supplies\" will be necessary.\r\n\r\nSEED AT STAKE.--A method sometimes adopted is to put out seed in the field,\r\nin prepared holes which indicate the exact position of the future trees.\r\nUsually three seeds are placed in each hole, and if two or three germinate,\r\nthe plant having the healthiest appearance is retained, and the others\r\nremoved. The possible objections to this method of planting are obvious to\r\nthose acquainted with field conditions, but in actual practice planting\r\nseed \"at stake\" has often proved highly successful. Naturally the results\r\nobtained must depend upon the selection of good seeds, the care exercised\r\nin the preparation of the \"holes,\" weather conditions, and the\r\ndiscrimination exercised in the selection of the plants to be\r\nretained--apart from such disabilities as the depredations of rats and\r\nother pests.\r\n\r\nBASKET PLANTS.--Yet another and perhaps the most popular method at present\r\nis the germination and growth of seedlings in baskets specially constructed\r\nfor the purpose. These plants are kept under observation until of the\r\nrequired age and growth. They are then conveyed to the field, and the\r\nbaskets are planted in prepared holes. The baskets, being of vegetable\r\nmaterial, are liable to be attacked by various diseases while in the\r\nnursery or after planting. It is considered advisable, therefore, to treat\r\nthem by dipping into some disinfectant such as tar, or a mixture of tar and\r\none of the common proprietary disinfectants. Otherwise a disease may be\r\nconveyed from the basket to the seedling.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR PLANTING.--There can be no other opinion than that ideally\r\nall land required for planting should be perfectly clear of timber of every\r\ndescription. After felling and burning, under ordinary conditions a certain\r\namount of clearing is effected, but in actual practice this amounts to\r\ncomparatively little. Big logs and stumps are left because the cost of\r\nclean clearing is judged to be prohibitive and non-economic. Surface timber\r\nis gradually cleared in the course of development, and usually large stumps\r\nare the last to be tackled. The objection to this procedure is really not\r\nstrong, but unfortunately an important point is generally overlooked.\r\nGranted that most of the dreaded diseases travel beneath the surface of the\r\nground by means of buried timber, it is plain that as far as stumps are\r\nconcerned, the chief source of danger lies in the existence of the roots.\r\nIf these were carefully exposed and removed, the isolated stumps would then\r\nnot be such potential infection points. It follows from this argument that\r\nthe importance of removing buried timber cannot be too strongly insisted\r\nupon. It is not uncommon to find that some years after the opening of an\r\nestate, and after surface timber has been removed, a large number of trees\r\nare affected with _Fomes lignosus_ (formerly known as _Fomes semitostus_).\r\nSuch cases are directly attributable to the existence of buried timber, and\r\nno local treatment will be successful unless the whole of the area is dug\r\nover carefully, and all pieces of timber removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW CLEARING; SLOPES \"HOLED\" FOR PLANTING; FLAT AREA BEING\r\nDRAINED.\r\n\r\n(_By courtesy of manager, Membakut Estate, British North Borneo._)]\r\n\r\nSILT CATCHMENT TRENCHES.--Granted the ultimate necessity of clean clearing,\r\nit becomes necessary to take some precautions to prevent loss of soil by\r\n\"wash\" in young areas planted on sloping land. An argument often used in\r\nextenuation of the practice of allowing large surface timber to remain\r\nuntil it becomes rotten is that it is an aid in preventing loss of soil by\r\nwash. Its removal necessitates the institution of some method of preventing\r\n\"wash.\" The establishment of terraces on steep slopes tends to the\r\nachievement of the desired result, but this method is not extended to more\r\nmoderate slopes where loss by wash is still considerable. It is the opinion\r\nof the writers and others that the general case calls for the institution\r\nof silt catchment trenches, which, as the name denotes, fulfil the duty of\r\ncatching any surface soil and of retaining rainwater. These trenches are\r\nusually laid out on contour, and do not exceed a length of 20 feet. They\r\nare usually from 18 inches to 2 feet wide and deep, and are so arranged on\r\nthe slope that they occupy overlapping positions. The actual number of\r\ntrenches required will depend upon the angle of slope; the steeper the\r\nslope the greater the number required--_i.e._, the shorter will be the\r\nlength of slope between any two trenches. Given a clean area, it is obvious\r\nthat the momentum acquired by running water (and hence the amount of soil\r\nremoved) on any one slope will depend upon the distance travelled. It is\r\nadvisable, therefore, to place a larger proportion of the trenches on the\r\nupper part of the slope than on the lower, so as to guard against the\r\nbreaking down of the trench system under an abnormal downpour of rain.\r\n\r\nOn land thus prepared the writer has seen areas successfully planted,\r\nwhich, under ordinary conditions, were condemned as being too steep for\r\nplanting. It is true that these trenches necessitate continual upkeep until\r\nthe soil becomes well shaded by trees, but the actual amount of work\r\ndemanded in cleaning and maintaining the trenches will depend largely upon\r\nthe thoroughness with which the original work was planned and executed.\r\nWhatever may be the weaknesses exposed as a result of providing an\r\ninsufficient number of trenches of inadequate dimensions, there can be no\r\nquestion that they are a necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_FIELD MAINTENANCE_\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAN WEEDING.--Intimately connected with the growth and development of the\r\nrubber tree one has to consider the conditions under which it is allowed to\r\nmature. The argument has been used that, since the habitat of _Hevea\r\nBrasiliensis_ is in the jungle, we should be proceeding against nature by\r\nintroducing conditions unlike those under which the \"wild\" rubber tree\r\ngrows. It is difficult to treat such an argument seriously, as by quoting\r\nparallel instances in arboriculture it could be shown that growth,\r\ndevelopment, and yields are improved by cultivation of \"wild\" plants.\r\n\r\nIt needs small experience with rubber-tree plantations to be convinced of\r\nthe necessity for dealing with other growths, which would otherwise soon\r\nsurround and overshadow young rubber trees.\r\n\r\nApart from checking and preventing woody undergrowths it is considered\r\nadvisable to keep the ground more or less free from light vegetable\r\ngrowths, which are roughly grouped under the heading of \"weeds.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, if these weeds are allowed to flourish and seed, their eventual\r\neradication may be a matter of extreme difficulty and expense. It is the\r\naim, therefore, of properly conducted estates generally to institute such a\r\nsystem of work that the weeding-gangs cover the whole estate at regular\r\nintervals; and, as a general rule, it may be accepted that the shorter the\r\ninterval between successive visits by the gang to any particular area, the\r\neasier it is to keep weeds in check, and the cheaper the work will\r\neventually be done. This procedure defines roughly what is implied by the\r\nterm \"clean weeding,\" and it is the policy adopted by most estates.\r\n\r\nStrict adherence to this practice in rubber cultivation has been inculcated\r\nby the older school of planters who obtained their experience in the\r\ncultivation of other crops such as tea, coffee, tobacco, etc.\r\n\r\nIn latter years the wisdom of scrupulous clean weeding under all conditions\r\nhas been questioned; and there can be no doubt that under certain special\r\nconditions a continuation of the policy of clean weeding is calculated to\r\nproduce, in course of time, more harm than benefit. As an instance, the\r\ncase might be cited of steep slopes on poor land. Continual clean weeding\r\non such areas will lead eventually to a great loss of the surface soil,\r\nunless some precautions are adopted for catching and retaining the fine\r\nsilt particles. It is to be noted that such a type of soil and slope, when\r\nthe shade is appreciable, often produces no weeds heavier in growth than a\r\nvery light grass. It is urged that the necessity for strict clean weeding\r\non such soils does not exist, and, in fact, that it would be an injurious\r\npolicy. Such arguments appear to be well founded in experience, and the\r\nwriters are in thorough agreement that such special cases deserve special\r\nconsideration. Rigid adherence to a policy of clean weeding, without regard\r\nto special conditions, would be most inadvisable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, such exceptional cases do not detract from the wisdom of\r\nclean weeding in general. Every planter of experience realises how easily\r\nfields become infested with weeds if the regular work is suspended or\r\ndelayed. It is probably quite true that the harm due to the presence of\r\nsome weeds on an occasion is negligible; but apart from this debatable\r\npoint, there is the solid fact that if once an area is allowed to become\r\nweedy it may soon demand a much greater expenditure to bring it back to\r\nnormal condition than if it had been regularly weeded. This is common\r\nexperience, and for that reason alone a general policy of clean weeding is\r\nthoroughly sound; especially if combined with some system of\r\nsilt-retention.\r\n\r\nGRASS SQUARES.--On some estates the practice of clean weeding is undertaken\r\nin combination with a system of silt-retention, which depends upon the\r\ndevelopment and maintenance of ridges. These are built up from the debris\r\nof weeding in the form of hollow squares. Grass is allowed to sprout and\r\ngrow in these ridges, and when it attains a certain height it is trimmed\r\ndown so as to keep it within bounds. The soil within the hollow square is\r\nclean weeded; and it is maintained that loss of soil by wash is avoided.\r\nUnder certain conditions there is a great deal to be said in favour of the\r\nmethod, but in the opinion of the writers it should be regarded only as a\r\nmethod of expediency. It is not to be preferred to the more thorough\r\npractice of soil-retention by means of silt-trenches, although the latter\r\nmethod may be slightly more expensive in the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL YOUNG CLEARING, WITH TIMBER.\r\n\r\nPlanted \"rubber-stump\" in foreground.]\r\n\r\n\"LALLANG\" ERADICATION.--The greatest bugbear of the planter in connection\r\nwith weeding is the incidence of lallang. Many proposals have been put\r\nforward at various times for the complete eradication of this pest; but at\r\npresent, under ordinary circumstances, there would seem to be no better\r\nmethod than by heavy and deep digging, followed by regular attention. The\r\nmethod is acknowledged to be expensive, but any half-hearted measure\r\notherwise taken will eventually prove to be even more costly.\r\n\r\nOne has to differentiate, of course, between the incidence of lallang\r\nattributable to negligence on the estate itself, and the occasional\r\noutbreaks near boundaries, due to seeds having been wind-borne from patches\r\nof lallang outside the boundaries But, in general, it would be safe to\r\nremark that the appearance of lallang could be taken as evidence of a\r\nfailure to cover the area at sufficiently short intervals.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, the usual method of eradication of areas of lallang\r\nis by thorough digging, and the exposure of the strong root system to the\r\nsun. As a matter of interest it may be noted that recently some success has\r\nbeen obtained by another method[1] on areas which one may have in view for\r\nplanting at some future date.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Eradication of Lallang,\" W. P. Handover, _The Planter_, Vol. I., No.\r\n1, August, 1920.\r\n\r\nIt consists in the employment of _Mimosa gigantea_, which eventually\r\nsmothers the growth of lallang.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are sown broadcast, in drills, or in pockets, amongst the\r\nlallang. In the course of about three months it overtops the grass and\r\nproceeds to travel. At this stage the whole mass is pressed down, and the\r\npressing is repeated at regular intervals. Under favourable conditions, in\r\nabout twelve months, an impenetrable mat has been formed, which gradually\r\nforms a good mulch. When it is desired to remove the Mimosa, the mass\r\n(pressed down) is cut and rolled up like a carpet. Cleared in this manner,\r\nthe area then needs regular weeding, in order to check the development of\r\nany stray lallang shoots. In actual practice it was found that the cost of\r\nthis method was approximately two-thirds that of the usual digging method.\r\n\r\nGREEN COVER PLANTS.--Some years ago it was quite common to find green\r\ncover-plants employed on estates with the primary idea of minimising\r\nweeding costs. With most of these it was found later that their value was\r\nnot real, and that they harboured diseases, and pests. Moreover, when they\r\nwere removed, it was often found that an abundant crop of lallang and\r\nweeds resulted.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that certain plants can be employed with\r\nadvantage, not only in the control of weeds, but also by reason of benefit\r\nto the soil in which they are established. These plants are leguminous, and\r\ntheir use is restricted almost entirely to young areas, inasmuch as they\r\nwill not continue to grow when shade becomes marked. Of those best known in\r\nmodern practice might be mentioned _Tephrosia candida_ (Boga bean),\r\n_Centrosema Plumerii_, and _Dolichos Hoseii_ (Sarawak bean).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL YOUNG CLEARING, WITH TIMBER.\r\n\r\nYoung rubber plants in foreground. Two of these are easily distinguishable,\r\nboth with small crowns of leaves.]\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to imagine, however, that the establishment of such leguminous\r\ncover-plants obviates weeding. So far is this from being the case, that in\r\npractice it is found that the weeding \"rounds\" must be conducted at first\r\nwith the same regularity as in ordinary working, but that naturally there\r\nis much less work to be done.\r\n\r\nAs the plants develop, they can be pruned or dug into the soil, as the case\r\nmay be. The addition of the green material to the soil, either by digging\r\nor by burying in open trenches, is calculated to cause improvement in the\r\ncondition of the soil. There may thus be a close connection between\r\nweeding, soil conservation, and soil improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_THINNING OF AREAS_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this subject there is unanimity regarding the necessity for the\r\noperation. Divergence of opinion exists only as to a matter of degree.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand there is the school of planters who would advocate the\r\nadvisability of planting up to, say, 200 trees per acre, with subsequent\r\nthinning out by selection. At the other extreme there is the opinion that\r\nwe should plant only a few more trees per acre than it is intended\r\neventually to maintain, the argument being that by this method the growth\r\nand development of individual trees will be so much greater than in close\r\nplanting that the necessity for drastic thinning out will not arise.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the latter school, a very important point is\r\noverlooked--viz., that size and general development are not criteria of\r\nyielding capacity. It might thus follow that a stand of ninety well-grown\r\ntrees per acre might give very disappointing yields per acre. In a few\r\ninstances this has been noted with 30 by 30 feet planting, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether the factor influencing such results has been appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe apostles of close-planting have this in their favour: that if the trees\r\nto be removed are selected on proper lines, it is possible to have all\r\nremaining trees of comparatively high-yielding strain. This is a very sound\r\nargument, but its practicability is limited very largely by the question of\r\nearly growth and development. It would seem the sane course in any event\r\nnot to plant more trees per acre than may grow normally, and without branch\r\nor root interference up to the fifth year (the normal first year of\r\ntapping).\r\n\r\nBefore this stage has been reached, stunted or deformed trees will have\r\nbeen noted and removed, so that in the first year of tapping thinning\r\nproper can be commenced. In the past this has been effected wholly by\r\nselection of trees according to their general appearance and situation; but\r\nit is now safe to predict that future operations will be based upon sounder\r\nand more scientific lines.\r\n\r\nTrees will be selected for removal according to their individual yields, a\r\nstandard which we have been advocating for years without much practical\r\nsuccess. In Java and Sumatra much good work has been done in this\r\ndirection, and recently a commencement has been made in the F.M.S.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPICAL YOUNG PLANTED AREA.\r\n\r\nHeavy original jungle timber.]\r\n\r\nIt is within the daily observation of all planters that certain trees\r\nregularly give greater yields than others, and that such trees are not to\r\nbe distinguished by size or general development. Moreover, with slight\r\nvariations, it has been found that a good yielding tree is consistently a\r\ngood yielder, and the converse holds true.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, measurements of individual yields are taken at intervals,\r\nand the results recorded during the first year of tapping of an area, an\r\nexcellent guide is obtained for the first round of thinning. It is found\r\nin actual practice that five, or even three, readings during the year are\r\nsufficient to give the indication required. It is not essential that\r\nsimultaneous readings should be taken over a large area; in fact, such a\r\nstep is really impracticable at first. The simplest method is to employ\r\neither--\r\n\r\n(_a_) A small uniform vessel in which the latex is measured by means of a\r\nthin slip of bamboo upon which graduations are marked.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A glass measure graduated regularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A RECENTLY PLANTED AREA.]\r\n\r\nIn both cases it is immaterial what units are represented by the\r\ngraduations--whether cubic centimetres, quarter ounces, half-ounces, or\r\nounces, as long as the unit is not too large. It is preferable to employ a\r\nfairly small unit, so that in taking readings from young trees a wider\r\nrange may be obtained between poor yields and good yields. In the case of\r\nolder trees a larger unit may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the operations is to number all trees in the field to\r\nbe tested, and to prepare a rough register, with three or five vacant\r\ncolumns opposite each tree number.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable to commence the record of yields until the panel of\r\nbark has been under tapping for a month or two. It is found that an\r\nintelligent coolie can be taught the method of measuring and rough\r\nrecording. The latter is accomplished by means of marks made upon the\r\nvirgin bark of the tree above the tapped area. The marks may be made with a\r\ntapping knife, by means of paint, or with a lead pencil. The simplest form\r\nof record consists in putting one mark for each graduation of reading.\r\n\r\nIn practice it is found that, commencing about an hour after the first tree\r\nhas been tapped (in the case of young trees) and following the course taken\r\nby the tapper, the measurer of yields is able to do about 2 full tasks (650\r\nto 750 trees) per diem. Each day progress is made through the field.\r\n\r\nObviously on such a small scale and utilising only one measuring coolie the\r\ncomparison is restricted very much; but in any case this is immaterial as,\r\nowing to the personal equation of the tapper, comparison strictly should be\r\nlimited and internal--_i.e._, it should really be confined to one task only\r\nat a time. In this way the worst trees in any task are indicated.\r\n\r\nThe keeping of the records may be entrusted to a field clerk, but is better\r\nplaced in the hands of a European. The register is taken into the field and\r\nthe rough records found on the trees are noted in the columns against the\r\ntree number.\r\n\r\nMost planters are aware in a general way of the disparity between the\r\nyields of individual trees, but they would probably be surprised if they\r\nundertook the institution of such records.\r\n\r\nThe following figures must not be taken as typical. They represent the\r\naverage results from several tasks in a young field from which all\r\nill-grown and deformed trees had been removed. It is immaterial what the\r\nunits represent, as they are purely arbitrary and were selected for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a fairly wide range.\r\n\r\nAny trees which failed to yield sufficient latex to reach the first mark\r\nwere registered at zero. The following percentages were obtained:\r\n\r\n  Zero                  3 per cent.\r\n  Above mark 1          6    \"\r\n    \"     \"  2         16    \"\r\n    \"     \"  3         42    \"\r\n    \"     \"  4         12    \"\r\n    \"     \"  5         14    \"\r\n    \"     \"  6          6    \"\r\n    \"     \"  7          0    \"\r\n    \"     \"  8          1    \"\r\n    \"     \"  9          0    \"\r\n                      ---\r\n                      100    \"\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that, judging by ordinary standards, it was impossible\r\nto discriminate between good yielders and others, and if thinning were to\r\nbe done on the usual lines it is quite possible that some of the best\r\nyielding trees would be removed.\r\n\r\nTaking the mark No. 5 as the datum line, it will be noted that 79 per cent.\r\nof the trees come below and 21 per cent. above. In the latter proportion\r\nthe majority lie close to the datum line. It will be seen that there are\r\noutstanding yielders even amongst these young trees, and that it would be\r\npossible to mark about 10 per cent. of the stand per acre at once for\r\nremoval in the first round of thinning.\r\n\r\nIn the case of old trees it is possible that one would encounter greater\r\nextremes of yields than those shown in the foregoing table, especially if a\r\ncertain amount of thinning had been done previously on empirical lines.\r\nSufficient has been written to show that the only reasonable basis for\r\nselection of trees in thinning is that of yields; and it is obvious that if\r\nthe method be adopted the future yield per acre of any area is bound to be\r\nin excess of the same area as thinned on rule-of-thumb lines.\r\n\r\nYIELDS PER TREE.--A great feature is made in estate reports of the figure\r\nshowing the average yield per tree per annum. Assuming an area to be\r\nyielding at the average high rate of 540 lbs. per acre per annum, with an\r\naverage stand of ninety trees per acre, the yield per tree per annum\r\naveraged over all trees is 6 lbs. Keeping in mind the test-figures on a\r\nprevious page, it will be obvious that some of these trees may have given\r\nvery much more than 6 lbs. during the year, and some less. In view of\r\npresent information it would not be surprising to find that a few might\r\nhave been yielding upwards of 15 lbs. per annum. Unfortunately this\r\ninformation is only to be obtained by individual tests, and under normal\r\nestate conditions the facts escape notice. Cases are known in which\r\nout-standing individual trees have been known to yield at the rate of 25\r\nlbs. and more per annum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIDELY PLANTED YOUNG AREA, JUST READY TO BE BROUGHT INTO\r\nTAPPING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD OF OLD RUBBER TREES IN WHICH THINNING HAD BEEN DELAYED\r\nTOO LONG.\r\n\r\nNote height and comparative lack of girth.]\r\n\r\nFUTURE YIELDS PER TREE.--It has been shown that by selective methods based\r\non yields, poor trees can be eliminated. Whether by a process of\r\nseed-selection or by means of propagation based on bud-grafting and\r\nmarcotting, it needs no great stretch of imagination to forecast future\r\nconditions under which trees may be bred which will be capable eventually\r\nof giving an average yield of 25 lbs. per annum over any given area.\r\nYields of 1,000 lbs. per acre per annum should be obtained easily.\r\n\r\nTREES PER ACRE.--This brings us to the question as to how many trees one\r\nshould leave to the acre after thinning operations. Figures have been given\r\nby various authorities, but it appears to the writer at the present time to\r\nbe impossible to lay down a general rule. So much depends upon conditions.\r\nIn certain cases where the soil is admittedly poor, the average growth\r\nbelow normal, and thinning has been postponed too long, the writer has been\r\nforced to the conclusion that it would be most inadvisable, and\r\ncommercially unsound, to reduce the stand of trees below 120 per acre. In\r\nsuch instances the average yield per tree equalled only 3 lbs. per annum,\r\nand although the trees were upwards of nine or ten years old the crowns\r\nwere small and sparse. It is doubtful whether such trees will ever exhibit\r\nany further development, and to thin them further would probably lead only\r\nto a diminution in the crop per acre.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions of growth an arbitrary figure of eighty trees per\r\nacre has been selected as a standard by many estates. In these cases it\r\nwould probably be correct to state that thinning was undertaken on almost\r\npurely empirical lines--_i.e._, that trees were not selected by tests of\r\nindividual yields. As far as such a method retained the apparently most\r\nvigorous trees it was successful; but in view of what has been written it\r\nmight explain some of the disappointing results which have followed upon\r\nsuch a system of thinning.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that any decision regarding the number of trees to be\r\nretained must be derived from a study of the detailed results of individual\r\ntests. If the large majority of the trees appear to be fairly uniform in\r\nyields the first thinning must be confined to comparatively few trees.\r\nWhere there is, on the other hand, a good percentage of high-yielding trees\r\nthe final stand per acre may be appreciably less. Unless and until such\r\ninformation is available, one cannot give any definite opinion as to the\r\nrequisite number of trees to be retained per acre.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, intelligence must be displayed in deciding which of several\r\nuniformly-yielding trees should be removed. In the average sense of this\r\nconsideration one must pay no attention to symmetry of spacing, but when\r\ndealing with trees of fairly uniform yields one needs to study the\r\ncharacteristic development of the trees individually, in order to retain\r\nthose which would appear to be most favourably situated with regard to\r\nsurrounding trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_TAPPING SYSTEMS_\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadly there are only two methods employed in obtaining the latex from\r\n_Hevea Brasiliensis_. The first is that employed in South America, where\r\nincisions are made by means of a light axe. The other is the system of\r\nexcision, or paring, of the bark practised on plantations in the East.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the plantation industry, the South American method\r\nseems to have been employed, and the writer has knowledge of trees on one\r\nof our best-known estates in Malaya which still exhibit the outward and\r\nvisible signs of that method. At a comparatively early stage, however, the\r\nmethod of excision was introduced. Curiously enough there appears to be no\r\nrecord of its inception or of the individual who was responsible for the\r\nsubstitution of this method. We have been so accustomed to regard it as one\r\nof the ordinary facts of estate procedure, that this point seems to have\r\nescaped notice and enquiry.\r\n\r\nAs a variant of these two main methods, a slight vogue was for a short\r\nwhile obtained by the operation known as \"pricking.\" This was generally\r\ncombined with excision of bark, and was then known as the \"paring and\r\npricking\" method; but the simple operation of pricking alone had its\r\nadherents, and various forms of instruments were designed to achieve the\r\nobject. As a means for obtaining a flow of latex, pricking may have been\r\neffective, but the general difficulties attaching to the collection of the\r\nlatex was such as to put the method out of favour.\r\n\r\nIn the employment of \"paring and pricking,\" a thin shaving of bark was\r\nexcised on one occasion. At the next tapping no bark was excised, but a\r\npricking instrument was used along the previously cut surface. It was not\r\nproved that any advantage was gained by this method, which was more\r\ncommonly employed in Ceylon than elsewhere, and it would be surprising to\r\nfind it in use at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary way the method of excision is practised in such a manner\r\nthat the \"cut\" gradually descends to the base of the tree.\r\n\r\nPlanters with original views, and of an enquiring nature, often query the\r\ncommon practice; and it has been suggested that \"as the latex descends by\r\nthe force of gravity,\" one's paring should be done in an upward direction,\r\nthus obtaining a greater pressure of latex--and hence a greater flow. It\r\nwill be obvious that it would be no simple matter to collect effectively\r\nthe latex thus obtained from the under edge of a sloping cut, but apart\r\nfrom this the argument would appear to be founded upon what is now accepted\r\nto be a fallacy--viz., that the latex _per se_ is manufactured in the\r\nleaves and gravitates down the tree.\r\n\r\nFORMER SYSTEMS OF TAPPING.--To hark back ten years in the plantation rubber\r\nindustry is equivalent to delving into history, since development has been\r\nso rapid. It was then thought necessary to place upon the trees a number of\r\nsimultaneous cuts which the modern planter would judge to be inconceivably\r\nexcessive. Were it not for evidence in the shape of photographs extant, it\r\nwould be difficult to convince a young planter that such systems were\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIt was not uncommon for trees to have from six to ten cuts, sometimes all\r\nplaced on one half of the tree in a herring-bone fashion, and sometimes\r\ndivided into two portions, each of which tapped the opposite quarter panel\r\nof the tree's circumference. Such superimposed cuts were spaced from 1 foot\r\nto 18 inches apart.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions, a spiral cut was employed, commencing at a height of,\r\nsay, 5 feet, and gradually descending to the cup at the base of the tree.\r\n\r\nLater systems varied from several cuts on a half-circumference, or on a\r\nquarter of the tree, tapped either daily, or on alternate days, to cases in\r\nwhich one-third or one-fifth of the tree was employed. Also popular were\r\nthe systems of the [V] and half-spiral cuts on half the circumference.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to be recognised that with all these systems demanding\r\na number of simultaneous parings from the same panel of bark, the rate of\r\nexcision was so heavy that the period available for the renewal of bark was\r\ninsufficient for continuous tapping.\r\n\r\nAs a result most of the systems specified have fallen into desuetude, and\r\nthe tendency has since been to reduce the number of cuts, or the\r\nperiodicity of tapping, so as to allow for increasing periods of bark\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days, a period of four years was thought to be an extremely\r\ngenerous allowance, whereas six years is now becoming recognised as a\r\nminimum necessity. Eight years is not regarded as extravagant, while with\r\nolder bark on some estates periods of ten and twelve years have to be\r\nallowed for full renewal. Even so no finality has been reached, and no\r\ngeneral rule can be laid down. Local conditions of planting and growth\r\nexercise great influence, and the writers have in mind instances in which a\r\nperiod of eight years has proved to be insufficient even for a first\r\nrenewal after the excision of virgin bark.\r\n\r\nIn the main the most popular systems of tapping are:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) One cut on a quarter of the tree, tapped daily.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) One cut on a third of the tree, tapped daily.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) One cut on half the circumference, tapped on alternate days.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) A [V] cut on half the circumference, tapped on alternate days.\r\n\r\nVariants and extremes are:\r\n\r\n     (1) One cut on a quarter, tapped on alternate days.\r\n\r\n     (2) One cut on a half, tapped daily.\r\n\r\nSuperficially viewed the latter is four times as strenuous as the former,\r\nand the relative position seems to be inexplicable. It may be explained\r\nthat as a rule the former system is practised on old trees with poorly\r\nrenewed bark, in order to allow for adequate bark renewal; and the latter\r\nis employed in opening young trees just brought into tapping, when the rate\r\nof bark renewal is at a maximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO CUTS ON A QUARTER CIRCUMFERENCE, ON AN OLD TREE.]\r\n\r\nA few estates in this country still continue to tap trees by means of two\r\nsuperimposed cuts on a quarter of the tree. This was a very popular system\r\nsome four or five years ago, but it has come to be recognised by practical\r\nexperience that any system employing superimposed cuts leads to a high\r\nconsumption of bark without proportionate increase in yield. For instance,\r\nif one compares the system of two cuts on a quarter tapped daily with a\r\nsimilar system employing only one cut, one finds that the major quantity of\r\nlatex is yielded by the lower cut, and that the single-cut system which\r\nexcises approximately half the amount of bark gives about 80 per cent. of\r\nthe yield obtained by the tapping of two superimposed cuts.\r\n\r\nOf experiments to test the relative values of different systems of tapping\r\nthere have been many. Most of them suffered from the initial handicap that\r\nthey dealt with systems which were then popular. In order to obtain any\r\nvalid result they had to be undertaken over a long period. Meantime there\r\nwas a progressive movement in actual estate practice towards a greater\r\nconservatism in bark removal, and hence the experiments as originally\r\nplanned lost value.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in Malaya it was difficult for experimenters to obtain practical\r\nsupport in the form of areas of trees suitable for experiment. As a result\r\nexperiments were often confined to small blocks of trees, and a small\r\nnumber of blocks, from which any conclusions derived were subject to\r\nconsiderable errors of experiment. Often comparisons were made between only\r\ntwo blocks, and no allowance was made for varying factors, such as initial\r\ndifferences in yielding capacities of the trees, soil conditions, or the\r\npersonal equation of the tappers. As a general rule, therefore, the results\r\nwere vitiated to a very appreciable extent.\r\n\r\nAll these factors were later taken into consideration in an experiment\r\nundertaken on behalf of the Rubber Growers' Association. In this instance\r\nunique facilities were provided by the London Asiatic Rubber Company on\r\ntheir property at Semenyih Estate, and it is only fitting that the company\r\nshould receive the recognition which its enterprise deserves.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a great advantage to have included in that experiment\r\nother features which have since come into prominence, but the original\r\nscope of the experiment had to be confined to the point of comparing yields\r\nobtained in making comparative tests based on one system of tapping with\r\ndifferent frequencies. Such data were required as a check upon a Ceylon\r\ntapping experiment which had attracted much attention. In that experiment\r\ntrees were tapped at intervals ranging from one day to seven days; and it\r\nwas concluded that after a period of three and a half years trees tapped\r\nwith greater intervals gave yields equalling or exceeding those obtained\r\nfrom trees tapped with shorter intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SINGLE CUT ON A QUARTER CIRCUMFERENCE, ON AN OLD TREE\r\nAND ON RENEWED BARK.]\r\n\r\nIn the Semenyih experiment the system chosen was that which had the\r\ngreatest contemporary vogue--viz., two superimposed cuts on a quarter of\r\nthe tree. The various blocks were tapped respectively every day, every\r\nsecond day, and every third day.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the conclusions drawn from the Ceylon experiment were not\r\nconfirmed. After a period of three and a half years' continuous tapping\r\nneither the alternate-day system nor the third-day system gave results in\r\nany way approximating to the yield of the daily system.\r\n\r\nThe actual average yields from these systems over the whole period were in\r\nthe order of--\r\n\r\n    _Daily._          _Two Days._      _Three Days._\r\n  100 per cent.      60 per cent.      45 per cent.;\r\n\r\nand throughout the course of the experiment neither of the other sections\r\nshowed any appreciable improvement in position relative to the daily\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nIn actual yields \"per tapping\" over the whole period the alternate-day and\r\nthe third-day divisions showed advantages of 20 and 35 per cent.\r\nrespectively over the daily portion.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second year of experiment another section of blocks\r\nwas opened with a single cut on a quarter, tapped daily. This enabled\r\ndirect comparison between the values of one cut and two cuts on a quarter\r\nin daily tappings and between a daily single cut and two cuts tapped\r\nalternate daily.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the daily single cut yielded over the period of experiment\r\n80 per cent. of that obtained by tapping two cuts daily; and that in the\r\ncomparison between two cuts tapped alternate-daily and a single cut tapped\r\ndaily the latter had an advantage of about 40 per cent. in yield.\r\n\r\nThis result has been used by advocates of daily tapping generally, but it\r\ndoes not constitute a fair argument, inasmuch as the single cut was tapped\r\ntwice as often, and its position was always relatively low on the hole of\r\nthe tree. It has been shown in the comparison between the daily single cut\r\nand the two cuts daily that the influence on yields of the superimposed cut\r\nis relatively small. A fairer comparison would have been obtained if the\r\ntwo cuts tapped alternate-daily had been either amalgamated to form one\r\nlong cut on half the tree or to form a [V] on half the tree, thus placing\r\nthe cuts in the opposing sections on the same level. With the knowledge\r\nthat the yield obtained from cuts is _always greater per tapping_ by using\r\nthe alternate-daily system, it would appear to be plain that the one long\r\ncut on half the tree would at least equal the yield of the single short cut\r\ntapped daily on a quarter tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE CUT ON HALF CIRCUMFERENCE (HALF SPIRAL).\r\n\r\n_Note._--In this particular instance the cut is changed to the opposite\r\nhalf of the tree every half-year.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no opportunity has been afforded up to the present of\r\ndefinitely proving this point by prolonged experiment under strict\r\nconditions. It is true that the view is held strongly in some quarters as a\r\nresult of the experience of managers, chiefly on their own estates, that\r\nalternate-daily tapping generally gives better yields than daily tapping.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances this view is probably correct, and the writers are\r\nin agreement; but it is necessary to clear away some misconceptions which\r\nconfuse the issue. In the main there are two schools, one of which plumps\r\nfor alternate-daily tapping, while the other adheres strongly to daily\r\nexcision. Great confusion exists, inasmuch as in many instances the\r\ndisciples of these schools are really discussing different matters. In the\r\ncase of managers who argue for alternate-daily tapping their experience is\r\ngained, with very few exceptions, from systems in which the excision covers\r\nhalf the circumference of the tree; whereas in almost all cases daily\r\ntapping is confined to a single cut on a quarter of the girth. Bearing on\r\nsuch a comparison there are, as far as the writers are aware, no reliable\r\npublished experimental results. To compare the results obtained from one\r\nsystem practised on one estate with the results of the other system\r\nestablished on another estate is not strictly permissible, as we know that\r\nconditions generally may vary to an enormous degree.\r\n\r\nThe controversy has raged, however, to such an extent that many who are not\r\ndirectly engaged in estate practice have obtained confused impressions. For\r\ninstance, it appears to be the belief in some quarters that alternate-daily\r\ntapping, when applied to a single cut on a quarter of the tree, will yield\r\nmore than an exactly similar cut tapped daily. In support of such a\r\nstatement there does not appear to be any confirmation under normal\r\nconditions; although such a result might be obtained in the case of old\r\ntrees which have been heavily over-tapped in the past, and on which the\r\nrate of bark renewal has been appreciably retarded. It might also be the\r\ncase eventually when trees with the opposing frequencies have been tapped\r\nfor a period extending into many years; but it is the opinion of the\r\nwriters that under normal conditions such a result would be extremely\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nWhen we come, however, to a comparison of daily tapping on a single cut on\r\na quarter with double the length of that cut on half the circumference, at\r\nthe same height, tapped alternate-daily--whether in the form of one long\r\ncut or in the form of a [V]--we arrive at a contrast which gives a clear\r\nissue. As already stated, facts and figures of reliable experiment are\r\nwanting; but it is the opinion and experience of the writers that the\r\nalternate-daily system at least suffers no disadvantage on the point of\r\nyields, and in other respects, such as conservation of labour and costs, is\r\nsuperior to the daily system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A [V]-CUT ON HALF THE CIRCUMFERENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_TAPPING AND COLLECTING_\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPPING KNIVES.--The choice of a tapping knife is a subject upon which\r\nthere is much divergence of opinion. This must be so because no known knife\r\nhas such apparent outstanding superior features or claims as would enable\r\none to settle the point. Moreover, the personal factor is so large that, as\r\nfar as the knives in common use are concerned, it appears to exert the\r\ngreatest influence. The possibility of obtaining the ideal knife, which\r\nwill go to sufficient depth into barks of varying thickness to yield the\r\nmaximum quantity of latex without wounding, is quite as remote at the\r\npresent time as it was some years ago. Meanwhile the search for that ideal\r\nknife continues, and occasionally one learns of the alleged merits of some\r\nnew instrument which, it is said, fulfils all requirements. It is only to\r\nbe regretted, both for the sake of the inventor and for the expectant\r\nbuyers, that the claims always fail in some one or more particulars.\r\n\r\nIn Malaya probably the number of different types of tapping knives may\r\namount to a half-dozen, but those most commonly in use are:\r\n\r\n     (1) The gouge--straight or bent.\r\n\r\n     (2) The ordinary farrier's knife.\r\n\r\n     (3) Modifications of the farrier's knife, such as the \"Jebong.\"\r\n\r\nArgument on the respective merits of knives is popular, and discussion\r\nseems endless. It is claimed for the bent gouge that it is superior to the\r\nstraight instrument, because, the leverage being downwards on the handle,\r\nthe tendency is to lift the cutting edge upwards and out of the bark,\r\nwhereas with a straight gouge the tendency is to push the knife downwards\r\ninto the bark. It is claimed, therefore, that the average shavings taken\r\noff by the bent gouge should be thinner than those obtained by the use of\r\nthe straight instrument.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons it is asserted that the \"Jebong\" and other\r\nmodifications are superior to the original form of the farrier's knife.\r\nThese points are generally accepted without great argument, but when\r\ncomparisons are made between the gouge and the farrier's knife (with its\r\nmodifications) the opinions of planters are so varied and conflicting as to\r\nbe almost irreconcilable. Two opinions based on experience with both types\r\nof knives are often wholly contradictory.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the likes and dislikes of operative coolies have\r\na considerable influence in determining the measure of success obtained\r\nwith any one knife. Should coolies have been accustomed to the use of a\r\nparticular form of instrument they become quite expert, and any proposed\r\nchange creates in the minds of coolies a prejudice which is considerable in\r\neffect on the quality of the handicraft. Such prejudice may be overcome in\r\ncourse of time, but in the interval not a little damage may have been done\r\nin the shape of tapping wounds. So considerable is this question of\r\npersonal favour that even on estates where a standard pattern of knife is\r\nissued coolies often modify that knife slightly on their own accord. Such\r\nalteration is ignored by the superintendents as long as the quality of the\r\ntapper's work is maintained at a high standard.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is a limit to such leniency, and this limit is soon reached\r\nin the case of knives having adjustable parts controlled by screws, or nuts\r\nand bolts, etc. Some knives of this description really merit a much wider\r\nuse than is afforded them at present; but in view of the potential damage\r\nwhich might be done as a result of adjustments made by the coolies these\r\nknives do not become popular.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed here to enter into a description of even recent\r\ninstruments for which strong claims are being made by their inventors or\r\nvendors. If they possess the merits attributed to them they will soon find\r\nfavour, as managers are always keen on studying the points of any new knife\r\nwhich will lead to a conservation of bark and a reduction in the number of\r\nwounds. On the whole, it may be advanced that the best general results are\r\nobtained by the adoption of a simple non-adjustable knife and the retention\r\nof its use.\r\n\r\nTHE CHOICE OF LATEX CUPS.--It has come to be recognised that the maximum\r\npossible cleanliness is essential in all details of estate work, and the\r\nyounger generation of planters could scarcely be aware that a few years ago\r\nit was deemed sufficient to use coco-nut shells for the reception of latex\r\non individual trees.\r\n\r\nTerne-plate cups ousted the coco-nut shell, and they had the merit of being\r\ncheap. The interior coating of tin did not last long if the cups were\r\nproperly cleaned. The iron being exposed, with a minutely roughened\r\nsurface, each microscopic projection served as a point around which latex\r\ncoagulated. Scrapping the film of interior rubber became more and more\r\ndifficult, and often the cups were burnt in order to get rid of the\r\naccumulation of rubber. The last state of such cups was worse than the\r\npreceding one. On some estates fairly successful attempts were made to keep\r\nthese cups clean by making the coolies bring them into the store each day.\r\nTerne-plate cups are not now in common use.\r\n\r\nAluminium cups have their advocates, but much the same argument applies to\r\nthe difficulty of keeping them clean as was used in the foregoing\r\nparagraph. On many estates, however, they are used with success, the usual\r\nmethod of treatment being to make the coolies bring them into the store and\r\nclean them there. Owing to the comparative lightness of the material such a\r\nscheme is more feasible than was the case with terne-plate cups.\r\n\r\nThe cups now most in general use are either of glass or white-ware, and\r\nprobably those of glass are the most extensively employed. There are many\r\ndetails to be studied in the choice between these two types of\r\ncups--_e.g._, percentage of breakage in transport and in the field, price\r\nwhen breakage is taken into account, etc.; but these apart the glass cups\r\nhave one advantage--namely, the ability of the superintendents to see\r\nwhether the cups have been properly cleaned. In the case of white-ware cups\r\nthis means an inspection and handling of individual cups, whereas in the\r\ncase of glass the point is settled by visual examination at a comparative\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE CUT ON TWO-FIFTHS OF CIRCUMFERENCE.\r\n\r\nThe opening cut covers two-fifths. Subsequent cuts occupy one-fifth of\r\ncircumference.]\r\n\r\nGlass cups are made in two patterns, one having a flat bottom and the other\r\na conical base. The latter is convenient for use when wire supports are\r\nemployed, the cup fitting into a loop placed beneath the spout. Used on the\r\nground its shape is an obvious disadvantage, as, unless a hole is scooped\r\nfor its reception, it has to be propped up with sticks or stones. Often a\r\ntouch is sufficient to upset the balance, and latex is lost.\r\n\r\nThe flat-bottomed cup, on the other hand, may be used with success equally\r\non a wire support or on the ground. It is sometimes said that owing to its\r\nshape the ease of cleaning, as compared with the half-spherical cup, is\r\ndiminished, and that if the cups when not in use are kept inverted upon\r\nsticks placed near the foot of the tree the breakage is apt to be high.\r\nThis latter objection is being rapidly removed as the practice of using\r\nthese sticks is losing vogue for various reasons, and wire cup-holders will\r\nbe in general use as soon as the cost of material becomes normal.\r\n\r\nThere are on the market, and in fairly wide use, cups of Chinese and\r\nJapanese manufacture. These generally consist of brown earthenware with an\r\ninterior glass finish. These are cheap in comparison with glass and\r\nwhite-ware cups, but it is a pity that the glass does not extend over the\r\nwhole of the cup. The outer surface has a tendency to collect rubber and\r\ndirt. On some few estates small china bowls or saucers are still used and\r\nare quite satisfactory, except for the favour with which they are regarded\r\nby natives on the outskirts of the estates.\r\n\r\nCLEANING CUPS.--The question of cup-cleaning would appear to be a very\r\nsimple one; but in practice it is quite a source of worry to managers,\r\nespecially where a mixed labour force is employed. Tamil coolies can be\r\nmade to clean their cups in the day's task and at odd times. Chinese\r\ncoolies, more often than not, either refuse to give the necessary attention\r\nor else demand extra pay for the work.\r\n\r\nThe method of cup-cleaning employed more popularly within recent years was\r\nthat of daily washing. The tapper carried two buckets, one for receiving\r\nthe latex and the other containing water. Pouring the latex in the bucket\r\nthe coolie then added a little water to the cup and added these rinsings to\r\nthe latex collected. The cup was next washed hastily in the bucket of water\r\nand replaced. By the time the coolie has emptied and washed some 200 cups\r\n(about half the task generally) the water has the consistency of dilute\r\nlatex, and the wet cup when replaced becomes coated with a thin film of\r\nrubber. If the latex is always collected in one direction it will be clear\r\nthat, while the cups at one end of the task are comparatively clean, those\r\nat the other end have the chance of being correspondingly dirty.\r\n\r\nControversy has raged respecting this question of cup-washing, and many\r\nestates have abandoned it as a daily practice. Coolies have not to carry an\r\nextra bucket of water. The contents of the cups are poured into the\r\nlatex-bucket, and the bulk of the latex film remaining is also removed by\r\nthe aid of a finger. The cup is then replaced, a thin skin of rubber\r\nforming on the interior surface. As a general rule this is easily removed\r\non the next occasion, except perhaps in dry weather. It is the custom on\r\nmost estates employing this practice to have all cups receive special\r\nattention at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThere are certain economic factors entering into the difference of opinion\r\nregarding the two broad methods employed. In some cases--_e.g._, on old\r\nareas--it would be practically impossible to follow the older method of\r\ndaily cup-washing, as the tappers have to employ two buckets for the\r\ncollection of the latex. The employment of special coolies for cup-washing\r\nwould be necessitated, such as may be seen sometimes on estates working\r\nChinese \"squatter\" labour--where the man taps, a child assists in\r\ncollecting, and another child, or the mother, washes the cups. It may be\r\npointed out that in such instances the helpers are not paid by the estate.\r\nTheir services merely mean a saving in time which is spent in the\r\nsquatter's garden, and perhaps the permission to the tapper to work a\r\nlarger number of trees than would be allotted ordinarily to a task.\r\n\r\nAgain, on some estates, the tappers, while not being required to carry a\r\nbucket of water for cup-washing, are given an increased number of trees to\r\ntap. Furthermore, on hilly areas under tapping, it is often manifestly\r\nunfair to expect the tapper to be able to carry two buckets during\r\ncollection, when the slope is such, as to make the manipulation of even one\r\nbucket a matter of difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that there is no clear issue for argument\r\nconcerning the two methods, and that the point must be decided on the\r\neconomic factors peculiar to each estate or district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTS UPON RENEWED BARK OF PREVIOUS TAPPING.\r\n\r\nNote uneven surface and callosities.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER EXAMPLE SHOWING THE EFFECTS OF PREVIOUS TAPPING.]\r\n\r\nWATER IN CUPS.--Much discussion used to take place regarding the necessity\r\nor otherwise for placing a small quantity of water in the cups when\r\ntapping. It was recognised that the permission to use water (with the idea\r\nof preventing coagulation) led to much abuse, apart from the question as to\r\nthe utility of the method. Dirty water was often used, although clean water\r\nmay have been placed in the buckets when coolies left the muster-ground.\r\nThe small quantity of water often exceeded the actual yield of pure latex\r\nby hundreds per cent., with the result that on arrival at the factory the\r\ndiluted latex was below the standard desirable for the preparation of a\r\ngood sheet-rubber.\r\n\r\nPREMATURE COAGULATION.--Other opinion to the contrary it is now generally\r\nacknowledged that the possibility of premature coagulation in the cup or\r\nbucket is at least not diminished by the addition of even clean water. The\r\nuse of water often obtained from estate drains clearly led to increased\r\ntrouble. The extent to which such premature coagulation takes place varies\r\ngreatly under the influence of many factors--_e.g._:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Cleanliness of cups and spouts (the latter an important item\r\n     often overlooked, and involving the presence of certain organisms\r\n     which effect coagulation).\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Rate and volume of flow of latex.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Size of tappers' tasks (involving the length of interval between\r\n     tapping, and the collection of latex).\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Distance to be traversed between the site of the task and the\r\n     store.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) Care in collecting, to exclude extraneous matter.\r\n\r\n     (_g_) Nature of transport; agitation of the latex to be reduced to a\r\n     minimum.\r\n\r\n     (_h_) Nature of the soil, and situation of the estate.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned factor is of great importance. As a general rule it is\r\nnoted that premature coagulation is less marked on estates situated on\r\ncomparatively hilly land. The greatest effect is remarked on estates\r\nsituated on the flat lands of the coastal area where peaty soils are a\r\nfeature. On many such estates, in spite of the observance of all ordinary\r\nprecautions, it is not possible to receive the latex at the factory without\r\na large percentage of prematurely coagulated rubber being found in the\r\ntransport vessels.\r\n\r\nANTI-COAGULANTS.--For this reason on these (and other) estates, the use of\r\nsmall quantities of anti-coagulants is common. The effect of these is to\r\nkeep the latex liquid and thus render possible the preparation of a higher\r\npercentage of first-grade rubber than would be otherwise obtained.\r\n\r\nAmong the better known agents which have such an effect upon latex,\r\nformalin and sodium sulphite (not bisulphite) are the chief. The latter is\r\nthe more popular as it is slightly cheaper and much more stable. As now\r\nused, it is in the form of an easily soluble powder (anhydrous sodium\r\nsulphite). The ordinary crystalline form of sodium sulphite as used in\r\nphotography is not recommended, on account of its comparative lack of power\r\nand its poor keeping qualities.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that, given two equal quantities of different latices,\r\ndifferent amounts of an anti-coagulant may be required to produce the same\r\neffect. Hence it should be remembered that a formula which suits the needs\r\nof one field or one estate will not necessarily prove suitable in the case\r\nof another field or estate. Unless this point is appreciated trouble may\r\nensue. On some estates it has been the custom to give equal quantities of\r\nsodium sulphite solution to all coolies irrespective of the ages of the\r\ntrees in the fields to be tapped. Thus it happened that the latex from one\r\nfield was found to have insufficient anti-coagulant present, while that\r\nfrom another field could only be coagulated by the addition of an excess of\r\nacid. In this matter the experience of the preliminary trials should have\r\ncaused some discrimination to be exercised as to the quantities of solution\r\nto be issued in each field or division. It has been found sometimes that a\r\nmoist glossiness in the smoked sheet could be attributed to the use of an\r\nexcess of sodium sulphite. Traces of the salt remained in the rubber, and\r\nas the substance is hygroscopic, moisture was being absorbed from the air,\r\nto cause a surface deposit which often returned even after the sheets were\r\nsurface-washed and re-dried.\r\n\r\nIf sodium sulphite is to be used in the field, the following formula, which\r\nis in wide use, may serve as a basis for trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Use of Sodium Sulphite in the Field._\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Dissolve anhydrous sodium sulphite in water at the rate of 1\r\n     pound to 3 gallons.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Of this solution each coolie is given about 3/4 pint. This is\r\n     usually sufficient for a task of 350 trees. The solution is used by\r\n     shaking a few drops into the cup or, diluted with an equal volume of\r\n     water, it is run down the main channel when the latex flows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. SHOWING EFFECT OF \"WINTERING.\"]\r\n\r\nOn some estates it is found either unnecessary or impracticable to use the\r\nsolution in this manner. Instead the anti-coagulant is placed in the bottom\r\nof the bucket prior to the commencement of collection. The solution is made\r\nas in (_a_) above, and roughly half an ordinary latex-cupful is placed in\r\neach bucket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. NEW GROWTH OF YOUNG LEAF ON SAME TREE.]\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING PAILS.--All vessels intended for the transport of latex should\r\nhave a smooth and curved interior, so that cleansing may be easy.\r\nPreferably the interior and exterior surfaces should be glazed, but it is\r\noften found that the enamel chips easily, and that the handles are too\r\nfrail in construction. The shoulder-pieces, to which the handles are\r\njoined, are often too lightly attached to the bucket. Something stouter in\r\nthe shape of enamelled ware is required, without an appreciable increase in\r\nweight. Until such a utensil is available, the heavily galvanised and\r\nbrass-bound milk-pails used on some estates are as good as anything at\r\npresent in vogue, providing they are kept scrupulously clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTS OF DISEASE--\"MOULDY ROT.\"\r\n\r\n(_a_) Note on right hand the panel next in order for tapping; a hopeless\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTS OF DISEASE--\"MOULDY ROT.\"\r\n\r\n(_b_) The present cut badly infected; above there is no renewal of bark.]\r\n\r\nThe collecting pails should be kept under cover, when not in use, either at\r\nthe muster grounds or at the factory. On some estates coolies are allowed\r\nto take them to their quarters, where they are used for various purposes.\r\nCurious effects of this practice have sometimes been noticed. As an\r\nexample might be quoted an instance in which premature coagulation was\r\nfound to take place to a surprising degree. It was discovered eventually\r\nthat the coolies (Javanese in this case) were in the habit of utilising the\r\nbuckets for the preparation of their food. A liquid extract of a popular\r\nfruit was often made. This extract was very markedly acid in character,\r\nand as the buckets were not afterwards thoroughly cleansed, the latex of\r\nthe following day suffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTS OF DISEASE--\"MOULDY ROT.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) As in (_b_); another tree.]\r\n\r\nPreferably all buckets should have a lid of slightly funnel shape. This is\r\ninverted during collection, and thus prevents much dirt falling into the\r\nlatex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EFFECTS OF DISEASE--\"MOULDY ROT.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) At close quarters. Note wounds due, apparently, to bad tapping, but\r\nreally caused by the disease.]\r\n\r\nPAYMENT BY RESULT.--The arguments for and against the institution of this\r\npractice are many. In actual result there can be no question that a higher\r\nyield is obtained by the adoption of a scheme under which the coolie is\r\neither given a bonus based on result or is paid at a definite rate per\r\npound. It is fully recognised, both by advocates and opponents of payment\r\nby result, that the personal equation of the tapper is a very important\r\nfactor. A good skilled tapper will always obtain a higher yield than an\r\nordinary individual from the same task of trees, and without any more\r\ninjury to the trees. It is argued, therefore, that such an operative should\r\nbe given the benefit of his skill. Apart from this, it is claimed that even\r\nthe average tapper does not do his best work if he knows that he will get\r\nhis daily wage, no matter what his yield may be, as long as he does not\r\ninjure the trees by wounding. It is claimed that this sense of security\r\nleads to shallow tapping which, while it has an agreeable appearance, does\r\nnot produce the available amount of rubber.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is advanced in opposition that under a scheme of\r\npayment by result the tappers' only consideration is the matter of\r\nobtaining rubber, and that considerable damage in the form of wounds is\r\ndone by over-deep tapping. That there is a great deal of truth in these\r\nstatements is not to be doubted. Much, of course, depends upon the amount\r\nand quality of the supervision possible, and upon the standard demanded. It\r\nis a notable fact, however, that on estates which first introduced the\r\nsystem some years ago the quality of the tapping compares favourably with\r\nthat of average estates, and in a few instances within the experience of\r\nthe writer the tapping is of a high standard. Possibly these are\r\nexceptional instances, and there can be no doubt that the opposition of\r\nmany managers of considerable experience is founded upon the deterioration\r\nin the standard of tapping which often follows the institution of payment\r\nof tappers by result.\r\n\r\nIt will be recognised by planters that apart from the personal factor in\r\ntapping, the worker might be so unfortunate as to be placed in an area from\r\nwhich the yield is naturally low, either by reason of its youth or from\r\nother natural causes. Obviously such individuals are entitled to special\r\nconsideration in respect of the rate per pound paid for the rubber\r\nobtained. Again, on very hilly land it may be not humanly possible for a\r\nworker to tap the usual number of trees. Hence to place him on a parity\r\nwith other tappers, as far as wage-earning capacity is concerned, a higher\r\nrate than ordinary must be given. It will be plain, therefore, that on any\r\none estate it is generally impossible to set a standard rate per pound for\r\npayment by result; the rate may vary, for example, from, say, 3 cents per\r\npound in old and high-yielding tasks to 12 cents or more per pound on young\r\nareas of the same estate.\r\n\r\nNaturally the actual rates paid will primarily depend upon the average\r\nyield per tree or yield per acre, and the lower the average yield the\r\nhigher the rates to be paid per pound. Thus, on low-yielding properties\r\nwhere the natural conditions render a high yield impossible the rate per\r\npound may reach a figure of 22 cents (approximately 6d.).\r\n\r\nThe methods of arriving at the yield of rubber brought in by individual\r\ntappers vary, but broadly they fall into two classes:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) That in which the volume of latex is ascertained (either by\r\n     measuring or by weighing), a sample is drawn, and the final\r\n     calculation made from the weight of the more or less dry sample.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) That in which, after noting the volume, the calculation is based\r\n     upon a reading of the dry rubber content of the latex, obtained by\r\n     means of an instrument such as the \"Metrolac,\" or any other instrument\r\n     working on the same principle.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of estates which have not adopted the full system of payment\r\nby result yet employed some such method of checking the yields of\r\nindividual coolies, as the observed results act as a great deterrent\r\nagainst various malpractices, such as neglecting to tap trees, adulteration\r\nof the latex, etc.\r\n\r\nTREE-SCRAP.--The thin film of latex which coagulates naturally upon the\r\nsurface of the tapping cut after the latex has ceased to flow is known as\r\n\"tree-scrap.\" Normally it is collected on all estates, but the method of\r\ncollection varies according to the class of labour employed. On most\r\nestates, where the labour is Tamil or Javanese, it is supposed to be\r\nremoved as fully as possible before the tapping cut is reopened. The narrow\r\nstrips are then placed in a bag or basket carried by the tapper. Chinese\r\ntappers usually decline to follow this practice of first peeling off the\r\nscrap, and remove it by the operation of tapping, with the result that the\r\nscrap when brought into the store has adhering to it various shavings of\r\nbark. Unless these can be thoroughly cleaned off the scrap cannot truly be\r\nclassed as \"tree-scrap.\"\r\n\r\nOXIDATION OF TREE-SCRAP.--It is often noted that some scrap is dark in\r\ncolour, and in this condition it is generally spoken of as \"oxidised\"\r\nscrap. The oxidation is probably due to an enzyme, and also to the presence\r\nof chemical substances of a phenolic nature. In the course of laboratory\r\nexperiments with normal latex, it was found possible to reproduce this\r\ndarkening due to oxidation by the addition of very small quantities of\r\nvarious phenols used in general chemical processes, and the rapidity with\r\nwhich the darkening was effected depended upon the quantity of the phenol\r\nadded. If this rapidly oxidising latex be mixed with normal latex, it would\r\nseem that the whole bulk of the latex is affected by this tendency to rapid\r\noxidation. It is observed that this condition under which any tree may\r\nyield rapidly oxidising latex is not a permanent one.\r\n\r\nCARE OF TREE-SCRAP.--As these scraps eventually give a grade of rubber\r\nwhich compares well with other and better-looking grades care should be\r\nexercised in collection and treatment so that its quality is not impaired\r\nin any way.\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT OXIDATION.--As a rule the scraps are picked over, and heavily\r\noxidised pieces are sorted out; otherwise the crepe rubber prepared\r\nexhibits black streaks. The scraps should not be allowed to remain in the\r\nsun (which induces \"tackiness\"), and if they have to be kept over night\r\nthey may be placed in a weak solution (1 per cent.) of sodium bisulphite to\r\narrest oxidation. It should be recognised that such a solution will not\r\n\"bleach\" already darkened scrap-rubber, and the nature of its action is\r\nonly anti-oxidant.\r\n\r\nBARK SHAVINGS.--In the matter of collecting bark-shavings much depends upon\r\nthe organisation and nature of the labour force. Probably, on the majority\r\nof estates bark-shavings are collected systematically, but on quite a\r\nnumber considerable laxity in this respect has been noted. This may arise\r\nfrom lack of adequate supervision or from the peculiar systems of working\r\nwhich seem to pertain to Chinese labour. Granted that the trees are well\r\n\"scrapped,\" and that the percentage of rubber obtained from shavings under\r\nsuch circumstances would be extremely small (say 2 per cent. by weight on\r\nthe total output), it does not need much calculation to see that annually\r\nthe loss of rubber to the estate must be considerable. It would also seem\r\nto follow that, if the adult labour declines to pick up bark-shavings\r\ncarefully, it might pay to employ children for the purpose. Or, as is done\r\nin some places, the adult labour might find it advantageous to collect\r\nbark-shavings at low rates per pound.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that if bark-shavings be allowed to accumulate in a\r\nheap for any but a short period, a fermentative and heating action is set\r\nup. The heat developed in these piles of shavings is so considerable that\r\nit is impossible to keep the hand in a heap for more than a second or two.\r\nShould this be allowed to persist, as would happen in the case of a\r\nbreakdown of engine or machines, it usually results in the final crepe\r\nrubber becoming tacky when approaching dryness.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this heating effect it is necessary to have spare jars or proper\r\ntanks in which the shavings may be soaked in water. In this condition\r\nbark-shavings may be kept for many days.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason (_i.e._, the heating effect and consequent tackiness)\r\nthe custom followed on some estates of allowing coolies to keep\r\nbark-shavings in their \"lines\" until they have accumulated a fair quantity\r\ncannot be commended, quite apart from the possibility of actual loss by\r\ntheft, which is thus rendered easy.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that where the trees are scrapped efficiently before\r\ntapping, the amount of rubber to be obtained from the treatment of pure dry\r\nshavings would be almost nil, and would scarcely repay the cost of\r\ncollection and working. In actual practice, however, it is not possible to\r\nguarantee that the shavings are free from some scrap-rubber. Shavings\r\nbrought in by Tamils and Javanese carry only a small amount of rubber,\r\nwhereas where Chinese tappers are employed the yield of rubber may be as\r\nhigh as 35 to 40 per cent. upon the total weight of the material treated.\r\n\r\nFew estates now are not equipped with \"scrap-washers\"--machines specially\r\ndesigned for removing the bark from the rubber--and if they function\r\nefficiently the resulting crepe should be free from bark-particles.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTION OF EARTH-SCRAP.--This, the lowest grade of rubber, is found at\r\nthe base of the tree. Theoretically, if proper precautions are observed,\r\nthe amount should be comparatively small, but in actual practice it may be\r\nvery appreciable. The usual contributory causes are:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Failure to replace cups beneath the spouts of trees which\r\n     continue to drip latex after collection.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Collection of latex at too early a stage.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Failure on the part of the tapper to ensure the flow of latex,\r\n     by means of the spout, into the cup.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Flowing of latex over the edge of the cut before it reaches the\r\n     vertical channel.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) \"Wash-cuts\" on wet days, when the volume of rainwater down the\r\n     tree is sufficient to wash the latex out of the cup.\r\n\r\nThe amount of earth-scrap collected on any estate will depend, all other\r\nthings being equal, upon the labour expended in its collection. Certainly\r\non well-organised estates, having ample labour, the amounts collected are\r\nhuge in comparison with other estates. The ground at the base of the tree\r\nbelow the latex-spout is systematically turned over with pointed sticks and\r\nlarge clots of rubber are often picked up. Here, again, it is advised that\r\nthe collected earth-scrap should not be allowed to remain in heaps upon the\r\nfloor of the factory. It should be placed in suitable tanks containing\r\nwater, and quite a considerable portion of the cleansing work is thus taken\r\nfrom the machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_TRANSPORT OF LATEX AND COAGULUM_\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF FIRST LATEX AND OTHER GRADES.--One of the problems\r\nconfronting any manager is the question of the percentage of first-grade\r\nrubber calculated upon the whole output. Inquiries are constantly being\r\nreceived for advice as to what the various percentages of each grade of\r\nrubber should be. This is a question to which no definite list of figures\r\ncan apply. There are so many little factors influencing the result. Some\r\nestates are not particularly careful in collecting tree-scrap. Hence quite\r\na quantity of tree-scrap finds its way into the crepe made from\r\nbark-shavings. On the other hand, bark-shavings are not collected\r\nsystematically on some estates, and the total output is thereby diminished.\r\nIn consequence the first-grade rubber shows a higher percentage than it\r\nwould otherwise. Again, if the earth-rubber is not regularly collected the\r\npercentages of the best grades are higher than they should be. In comparing\r\nthe percentages of each grade of rubber from any two estates, therefore,\r\none should have all the information possible as to the various working\r\ndetails of the estates. Without wishing to lay down any definite\r\nproportions which can be applied to all estates it might be said that,\r\ntaking averages over a large number of estates, the percentages to be aimed\r\nat are:\r\n\r\n  First-grade latex   75 per cent. to 80 per cent.\r\n  Other grades        20    \"      \"  25    \"\r\n\r\nFor these figures one promises that all lower grades are collected and\r\naccounted for carefully and regularly. The distribution of the lower grades\r\nwill depend upon the field practices of the particular estate, but the\r\nfollowing list might be given for an estate keeping all lower grades\r\ndistinctly separate:\r\n\r\n  First-grade latex         75 per cent.\r\n  Cup-washings            }\r\n  Coagulated lump, etc.   } 10    \"\r\n  Tree-scrap                 9    \"\r\n  Bark-shavings              4    \"\r\n  Earth rubber               2    \"\r\n                           ---\r\n                           100    \"\r\n\r\nEmphasis is again laid on the statement that these figures must not be\r\naccepted as a standard. Nevertheless, they may prove of some service to\r\nmanagers in giving an idea of what the general line of percentages may be.\r\nThere are special circumstances, such as distance of transport and the\r\nnature of the land, which at present would render the attainment of more\r\nthan 75 per cent. first-grade rubber impossible on some estates. Still the\r\nfact remains that if the percentage is low through distance of transport,\r\netc., some method will have to be discovered by means of which the\r\ndifficulty maybe overcome. On a few estates the percentage of first-grade\r\nrubber obtained sometimes reaches 85, but these results are rather out of\r\nthe ordinary. An estate which collects all lower grades properly is doing\r\nwell if the percentage of first-grade rubber is 75 or over.\r\n\r\nEARLY COLLECTION.--As already noted in the preceding chapter, one of the\r\nfactors influencing premature coagulation is that of the interval elapsing\r\nbetween the commencement of tapping and the collection of latex. It will be\r\nseen that this ordinarily would depend, in turn, upon such considerations\r\nas the size of the tappers' tasks, the spacing of the trees, and the\r\nnatural conformation of the land over which the tappers have to perform\r\ntheir tasks. In general it need only be remarked that every possible\r\nconsideration should be given to this question, and that any delay should\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT.--Wherever possible it is endeavoured to convey latex from field\r\nto factory by man-power. Tamil coolies, as a rule, place the bucket on the\r\nhead; Chinese and Javanese coolies like to use a balanced carrying-pole.\r\nWhere distance renders these methods too costly in time and labour, it is\r\nusual to have field centres where the latex is collected and dispatched to\r\nthe factory generally (_a_) by means of vessels conveyed on light railways;\r\n(_b_) in large cans placed on motor-lorries; (_c_) in cylindrical\r\ngalvanised drums supported on two wheels and drawn by bullocks. There may\r\nbe variants, but these are the chief means of transport in bulk over a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, the best system is that employing a trolley-line, as great\r\nagitation of the latex is avoided, and the time in transit is much reduced.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of transport by bullock power is slow, and as estate roads\r\n(and even Government roads) are often below the standard expected in this\r\ncountry, the jolting undergone by the latex is, to say the least, not\r\ncalculated to afford a high yield of first-grade rubber. The late Mr. F. W.\r\nF. Day advocated the use of a circular perforated wooden grid, to be\r\nfloated on the latex, in order to moderate the wave effect produced by\r\njolting.\r\n\r\nWhatever the means of bulk-transport employed, it should be the care of\r\nthose in charge to see that vessels are not allowed to remain in the sun\r\nlonger than is necessary. Even during the journey they should be shaded in\r\nthe best possible manner.\r\n\r\nThese large transport vessels usually receive what is really only\r\nperfunctory attention in the matter of cleaning. They should receive the\r\nsame care as would be exercised in dealing with milk cans in other\r\ncountries. Ordinary sluicing with water is not sufficient, and if they\r\ncannot be sterilised by means of boiling water, they should be treated,\r\nafter ordinary washing, with a 5 per cent. solution of sodium bisulphite\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nANTI-COAGULANT FOR TRANSPORT.--When anti-coagulants are not used in the\r\ncups or buckets, it is advisable to use them in the bulk-transport vessels.\r\nEither formalin or sodium sulphite is of service, but the great objection\r\nadvanced against the former is its loss due to evaporation while the carts\r\nare going to the fields or waiting at the centres. For this reason sodium\r\nsulphite is now generally employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Use of Sodium Sulphite in Transport._\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Dissolve 1 pound of powder in 3 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Of this solution, place half a gallon in the vessel for every 30\r\n     to 40 gallons of latex.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT BY COOLIE.--As already pointed out, the extent to which man-power\r\ncan be used in transport of latex is generally limited. On small estates it\r\nis an easy matter for coolies to carry the latex to the factory, but on\r\nlarger estates many difficulties may arise, which may also militate against\r\nthe successful use of other means of transport. It is not uncommon to find,\r\ntherefore, that a policy of decentralisation has been adopted.\r\n\r\nCOAGULATION CENTRES.--Divisions of the estate have their own small stations\r\nat which latex is received and coagulated. In this way it is possible to\r\nreceive latex without much delay, and with benefit to the resultant rubber,\r\nespecially if prepared in sheet form. Much controversy has arisen regarding\r\nthese decentralised establishments, but the fact remains that on large\r\nestates, which are efficiently controlled, the scheme has been highly\r\nsuccessful from all points of view. On the other hand, it is alleged that\r\nthis method of working increases costs, and often gives an unsatisfactory\r\nquality of rubber. Concerning the latter point it seems to be reasonable to\r\nexpect that the European in charge of any division should be conversant\r\nwith the method of preparation required, and should be capable of seeing\r\nthat no mistakes are made. Given uniform equipment in all stations, and\r\nuniform rules for treatment of the latex, there does not appear to be any\r\nvalid reason why the product of one station should be inferior to that of\r\nthe others. Neither is it so in the case of several estates which might be\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of costs of working the writer has had to investigate several\r\ncases regarding which there was dissatisfaction. In some instances it was\r\nfound that the stations had not been placed advantageously with respect to\r\na water-supply; and instead of one or two coolies pumping for an hour or\r\ntwo, a larger number had to be employed for hours in the carriage of water\r\nfrom the nearest available source. This meant that, as the coolies were on\r\ndaily wage, the force appeared to be much bigger than that usually\r\nrequired. In other cases there were too many store coolies, when often the\r\nplace of some could have been taken for the necessary period by tappers\r\narriving early from the nearer fields. Sometimes costs were increased by\r\nreason of the use of an excess of chemicals, owing to the lack of uniform\r\nrules throughout the several stations. In spite of all that has been\r\nwritten, and the verbal instructions that have been given, it was not\r\nuncommon to find unstable chemicals such as sodium bisulphite exposed to\r\nthe moist air. In this way not only was there waste of material, but also\r\nthe probability of inferior rubber being made.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT OF COAGULUM.--On the whole if it is a question between the\r\ntransport of latex and the transport of coagulum, the writer would always\r\nfavour the latter, for reasons which have possibly been made clear in the\r\npreceding paragraphs. In effect, it should be recognised that the less\r\nhandling and transport the latex receives the better the general result.\r\n\r\nIf proper precautions are taken, the transport of coagulum intended for the\r\npreparation of crepe should present no difficulty, and should have no\r\ninjurious effect upon the quality of the resultant rubber. It is only too\r\ncommon, nevertheless, to note defects, in the finished crepes, which can\r\nonly be attributed to a failure to observe reasonable care in the transport\r\nof the coagulum. For example, it has been observed that a mass of coagulum\r\nfrom a coagulation station has been conveyed on the floor of a\r\nbullock-cart, or motor-lorry, previously used in the carriage of other\r\nmaterials. Unless the boards have been most scrupulously cleansed, the\r\ncoagulum is found to be contaminated, often to a marked degree. Again,\r\nalthough the cart may be clean, it may have to travel some distance on\r\nroads carrying a fair amount of motor traffic. Even should the cart have a\r\ncanopy, road-dust is often whirled through the open sides of the cart; and\r\nin the districts where red laterite roads are common, the stain of such\r\ndust often persists in the finished crepe. It scarcely need be remarked\r\nthat coagulum should be transported in closed wooden boxes or in galvanised\r\niron drums fitted with lids; and that preferably sufficient water should\r\nbe present in these receptacles to allow the coagulum to float. All such\r\ncontainers should receive the same scrupulous attention as the vessels\r\nemployed in the transport of latex.\r\n\r\nThe successful transport of coagulum for sheet-making is fraught with much\r\ngreater disabilities, and it is usual to note on most estates that the\r\nresulting sheets from out-stations are always inferior, in final result, to\r\nthose coagulated and prepared at the central factory. If the flat pieces of\r\ncoagulum are placed in piles of any height it is common to find, on arrival\r\nat the factory, that much adhesion has been caused. There is great\r\ndifficulty in separating the pieces, and often the successful operation is\r\nimpossible. It is usual to hand-roll the coagulum before transport, but it\r\nis often found that by the time the rubber reaches the factory it has\r\nbecome too hard for subsequent good results.\r\n\r\nOne of the strong arguments in favour of the establishment of divisional\r\nstations is to be found in the preceding paragraph. Sheet-making, as it\r\nnecessitates the employment of only light machines suitable for hand-power,\r\nis a feasible proposition in a field station. There is no reason for sheets\r\nmade thus to be in any way inferior to those made at a central factory; in\r\nfact, they are often better, as the latex has the chance of being treated\r\nwhen comparatively fresh.\r\n\r\nIf it is found necessary to transport sheet-coagulum, every possible\r\nprecaution should be taken against piling the pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter hand-rolling some estates bring the rubber from the field-stations to\r\nthe central factory in drums of water, others in shallow boxes containing\r\nnot more than half a dozen sheets in a pile. A method proposed long ago,\r\nbut not in practice, was to have a number of shallow trays subdivided so\r\nthat each compartment held one sheet only. If these trays were properly\r\nmade and carefully fitted there appeared to be no reason why they should\r\nnot form sliding parts of a large box, in which squeezing and adhesion of\r\nthe pieces of coagulum would be avoided. Naturally any such device would\r\nincrease appreciably the weight to be transported, and on this ground would\r\nnot find popular favour except where motor-power is used for road\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nFACTORY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_PRELIMINARY TREATMENT OF LATEX_\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION OF LATEX AT THE STORE.--Bearing in mind the remarks in Chapter\r\nVI. on the conditions under which latex is transported, it follows that\r\nnothing but the very best and most suitable vessels should be used in the\r\nstore. A point to which adequate attention is not given in many factories\r\nmight be mentioned here. Considering the importance attached to colour in\r\nthe dry rubber by brokers and consumers, and knowing how extremely trivial\r\nare the causes which may mar the colour, it is rather surprising that\r\nbetter provision is not made for the reception and handling of latex in\r\nfactories. Too often the receiving vessels are placed on the floor of the\r\nstore close to the entrance. Coolies bringing in latex cannot avoid\r\nbringing with them quite a considerable amount of dirt. Presuming that a\r\nhose-pipe has been installed, and that the floor is constantly being\r\nsluiced down with water, no great harm will result. But would it not be\r\never so much better if the dirt were kept out? In how many factories is\r\nprovision made for this? Such an arrangement is not difficult to make, and\r\nis already in practice on a few estates. A verandah is built outside the\r\nwall of the factory and all latex is received there. In another place open\r\nchutes are provided which terminate in the straining sieves. The coolie\r\nthus stands on the verandah where he removes coagulated lump and impurities\r\nfrom the latex, which is then poured down the chute, passing through the\r\nsieve into large coagulating jars or tanks.\r\n\r\nToo often it would appear, from the writers' observation, there is a lack\r\nof adequate supervision on the arrival of latex at the store. Much can be\r\nlearned from an inspection of the coolies' buckets, and the cause of small\r\ndefects in the finished rubber can often be thus traced. Leaves, stems,\r\nbark-shavings, and dirt appear in the buckets, and it is a source of\r\nconstant surprise to imagine how even unintelligent coolies can allow such\r\nthings to happen. These objects are removed before or during straining, but\r\nstill they ought not to be there in the first place, and the fact that such\r\na state of things exists is evidence of neglect on the part of the coolies\r\nor lack of supervision. Efforts are made in a large number of cases to cope\r\nwith these troubles, but on some estates things are allowed to proceed in\r\nthe same slipshod way, and too much responsibility is thrown on the\r\nstraining process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISED VERANDAH FOR RECEPTION OF LATEX; LIKEWISE EQUIPPED\r\nWITH FACILITIES FOR CALCULATING INDIVIDUAL DAILY \"YIELD PER COOLIE\" BY\r\nSAMPLING OF LATEX.]\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that it should be the business of a European to supervise\r\nthe reception of latex every day. This is at present quite impossible on\r\nsome estates, but it does not alter the fact that this supervision should\r\nbe provided, and is extremely necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how the point is overlooked in many factories--not that\r\nthey are in a dirty state, but they fall short of being classed as clean\r\nfactories for want of the little that makes the difference. Possibly those\r\nin charge do not believe that all this fuss need be made, but the writers\r\ncan assure them, from a practical knowledge of a very large number of\r\nfactories, that cleanliness does pay.\r\n\r\nIt might not be credited to Tamil coolies, but yet it is probably true,\r\nthat the moral effect of working under the cleanest and best conditions has\r\nan influence upon the store coolies, and that their work is better in\r\nconsequence. Everything which will tend to simplify the cleansing of the\r\nfactory should therefore be installed. Hose-pipes, glazed tiles, clean\r\nfloors, plenty of light and air are not fads or fancies, but considerable\r\nfactors in determining the final quality of the rubber. There is\r\nconsiderable truth in the suggestion that the coagulating room and machine\r\nroom should be as \"spick and span\" as a modern home dairy.\r\n\r\nSTRAINING OF LATEX.--This is a most necessary process, and one which\r\nusually entails much trouble and time which one could wish avoided. It will\r\nbe admitted that the trouble could be reduced greatly if the regulation of\r\nfield processes could be made more stringent. In spite of knowledge that\r\nimpurities must not be allowed to enter the cups, coolies will ignore the\r\nrule that the cup must not be placed in position until the bark shaving has\r\nbeen cut. The result is that pieces of bark fall into the cups, and coolies\r\nare generally too careless or too hurried to remove them.\r\n\r\nAgain, when cups are placed on the ground, it is easy to see that dirt may\r\nadhere to them. In the collection of latex some of this dirt may fall into\r\nthe bucket. Since the introduction of cup-holders on many estates the\r\ntrouble from this source has decreased considerably, but, nevertheless, it\r\nmay be taken for granted that even under the best of conditions all latex\r\nrequires straining.\r\n\r\nThe best type of strainer has yet to be evolved. Usually it consists in\r\nprinciple of a piece of fine brass mesh contained in some form of holder.\r\nTheoretically such a strainer should work well, but in actual practice\r\nnearly all strainers are a source of continual worry. Undiluted latex, as\r\nreceived at the factory, is of a rich consistency, containing very fine\r\nparticles of dirt and often minute particles of prematurely coagulated\r\nrubber. The latter soon clog a fine mesh strainer, while the former may\r\npass through. When the flow through the strainer becomes slow, the coolie\r\nin charge generally rubs the top surface of the sieve with a piece of\r\ncoagulum, thus forcing material through the mesh. He then rubs the\r\nunder-surface, with the result that undesirable matter falls into the\r\nstrained latex. In theory it seems a simple matter to have a number of\r\nsieves ready so that a clean one may be substituted for a clogged one,\r\nwhich should be cleansed at once with water. In practice the factory coolie\r\nwill probably only carry out instructions when the eye of the\r\nsuperintendent is alert. As a result of the rubbing and consequent strain,\r\nthe brass mesh usually breaks away from its support and the fracture may\r\nnot be detected for some time, during which irreparable damage may have\r\nbeen done to the resultant rubber.\r\n\r\nIn view of the presence of the fine particles of dirt, to which allusion\r\nhas been made, fine sieving of the latex appears to be essential,\r\nespecially when sheet-rubber is to be prepared. The fine sieves are\r\ngenerally of the type known as \"60 mesh,\" and they do not usually give\r\nthoroughly satisfactory results even when the gauze is supported and\r\nstrengthened by means of cross-wires placed underneath. The general fault\r\nwith these strainers is that a sufficiently wide \"selvage\" is not allowed\r\nin the clamped edges of the gauze, or that the edges of the support are so\r\nsharp and abrupt that the strands of the gauze are soon severed by the\r\nstrain imposed in vigorous cleaning.\r\n\r\nMany estates use two strainers; the first a more robust one containing \"30\r\nmesh\" gauze, and the second the fine \"60 mesh.\" Even this device does not\r\nbring about the desired immunity from trouble. Relief could be obtained if\r\nthe latex were always in a more freely fluid form. Estates employing\r\nanti-coagulants in the field benefit in this respect. Other estates,\r\nalthough finally using the finest of mesh, experience far less trouble than\r\nmost estates by reason of a difference in method of working. This can be\r\nexplained by an outline of the system adopted on a particular estate:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) On arrival of the rich latex at the store, all visible\r\n     coagulated lumps and other extraneous matter are removed by the\r\n     tapper.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Each tapper's latex is diluted with a quantity of water.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The diluted latex passes through two sieves, one above the\r\n     other. The top sieve is of stout perforated zinc sheet, with 10\r\n     circular holes to the inch. This removes all large particles. The\r\n     lower is of \"30 mesh\" brass gauze, and practically no rubbing is\r\n     required. The latex is now in glazed-tile tanks, in which it is\r\n     further diluted to the required standard by means of a recording\r\n     instrument.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The latex flows by means of a chute into the coagulating tanks,\r\n     passing through a large \"60 mesh\" sieve.\r\n\r\nIt is not guaranteed that this method will furnish a complete absence of\r\nvery fine particles of dirt in sheet rubber, as the human element enters so\r\nlargely into the question; but it can be stated that no complaints have\r\nbeen received on the point of \"specks of dirt\" since this system was\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nOn the same estate fine sieving in the preparation of pale crepe has been\r\nabandoned as an unnecessary refinement. The two coarse sieves mentioned\r\nabove are employed only, and it is to be acknowledged that the results\r\njustify the procedure.\r\n\r\nBULKING OF LATEX.--Not long ago advanced estates used to combine all latex\r\nbefore coagulation, in order to obtain uniformity of product. Previously it\r\nhad been the custom to deal only with comparatively small separate volumes\r\nof latex, with obviously great disadvantage.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of instruments such as the \"Metrolac,\" by means of\r\nwhich any volume and all volumes of latex may be reduced to a common\r\nstandard of dry rubber content, the necessity for \"bulking\" has passed. It\r\nis not now necessary to keep latex standing, perhaps for two hours,\r\nawaiting the arrival of other latex from distant fields.\r\n\r\nSTANDARDISATION OF LATEX.--In modern practice, as already pointed out, it\r\nis possible now to handle any volume of latex with a view to its reduction\r\nto any required standard of dilution for the purpose of obtaining a\r\nuniform product. For the reception and subsequent handling of the latex\r\nvarious schemes have been devised, and they are usually planned in\r\nconnection with coagulating tanks used in the preparation chiefly of sheet\r\nrubber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: END-SECTION SKETCH OF VERANDAH, ETC., SHOWING A GOOD METHOD\r\nFOR RECEIVING LATEX AND FILLING TANK.\r\n\r\nT, Sheet coagulation tank; C, cylinder for reception and dilution of latex;\r\nGG, gutter; PP, raised platform on verandah; SS, steps leading to platform;\r\nW, dwarf wall; EE, expanded metal partition; OO, open.]\r\n\r\nIn the successful working of a tank it is necessary, in order to obtain the\r\nbest results, to standardise all latex. This cannot be effected properly in\r\nthe tank itself, and hence it is the practice to dilute each lot of latex\r\nto standard before it is run into the tank. In the ordinary way this would\r\nentail a great deal of labour in handling the diluted latex. To obviate\r\nthis, the scheme outlined in the accompanying sketch has been suggested on\r\nseveral occasions and in various quarters. Such a scheme or modification of\r\nit has been put into successful practice on several estates. Although the\r\ndrawing was made some considerable time ago when estates were not then\r\nprepared to go so far in this direction, subsequent modifications show only\r\nminor differences which, while leaving the original principle intact,\r\ntestify to a fertility of resource in adapting the idea to existing\r\ncircumstances and buildings. The drawing is _in toto_ almost a replica of\r\nthe original installation now in successful use on the Kinrara Estate of\r\nthe Ledbury Rubber Company. On this company's Ledbury Estate likewise a\r\nsimilar system is employed, except that the reception verandah is part of a\r\nnatural formation and needed no such direct raising. Several other estates\r\nhave now adopted the scheme, which has been proved to be of practical\r\nvalue. The writers make no claim to originality in the idea, which might\r\nhave occurred to many independently on the introduction of coagulating\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISED VERANDAH FOR RECEPTION AND HANDLING OF LATEX.]\r\n\r\nVERANDAH.--In reproducing the drawing it is believed that the sketch will\r\nconvey practically all the information required. It may be explained that\r\nthe coolies are allowed to enter only the outer part of the verandah. The\r\nbuckets are handed across the low wall into the care of factory coolies,\r\nwho strain the latex through gauze sieves into the latex cylinders.\r\n\r\nLATEX RECEPTION VESSELS.--These cylinders may be similar to the tanks\r\ncommonly used for transport of latex from distant fields to the factory. An\r\n80-gallon cylinder is easily mounted by its trunnions on a suitable iron\r\nframework which is superimposed on a skeleton truck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER SET OF DILUTION TANKS ON RAISED VERANDAH.]\r\n\r\nThe latex is diluted down to standard in the cylinders, the truck is moved\r\nopposite the compartment to be filled, and a light movable gutter is placed\r\nbeneath the vent of the outlet pipe. This pipe is fixed in the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, and is provided with a large stop-cock which is operated by a\r\nspanner key. The stop-cock should be of the simplest type, capable of being\r\ntaken apart and assembled in a minute or so. The orifices should be large\r\nenough for a coolie to insert at least two or three fingers so as to\r\nfacilitate cleaning, and the pipe should have no right-angle bends.\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the cylinder a scale of gallons may be painted, so that\r\none may possess a knowledge of the quantities run into, or required for the\r\ncompletion of, any compartment.\r\n\r\nA SCREW PLUG UNSATISFACTORY.--It may be of benefit to managers who\r\ncontemplate such an installation to know that the adoption of a stop-cock\r\nin the vent pipe of the cylinder is the outcome of experience. In one\r\ninstance the vent pipe as designed was fitted with a screw plug at the end.\r\nUnfortunately with this arrangement the flow could not be regulated, and\r\nowing to the \"head\" of the latex it dashed violently down the gutter,\r\nstruck the bottom of the coagulating tank, and thence was scattered over\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nANOTHER INSTALLATION.--In another type of installation, in place of the\r\nvessels travelling upon a raised verandah platform, the standardised latex\r\nis conveyed to the coagulating tanks by means of drums supported by hooks\r\nto a chain-block and pulley which travels on an overhead gantry. This\r\nmethod is practicable, but may be regarded as less satisfactory in general\r\nworking than the verandah method of treatment.\r\n\r\nA MODERN INSTALLATION.--In the most recent scheme for dealing with the\r\nreception of latex, its standardisation, and conveyance to the coagulating\r\ntank, the main principle of the first system outlined is retained; but the\r\nreceptacles are not mobile. Glazed-tile tanks are employed, the capacity of\r\neach being approximately equivalent to that of each unit coagulating tank.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations show the general arrangement and some\r\ndetails of the system of reception tanks employed on the well-known\r\nPataling Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_COAGULATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether it is necessary to employ any coagulant, or whether latex should be\r\nallowed to coagulate naturally, will not be discussed at this stage.\r\nNeither will mention be made of any patent processes of coagulation which\r\nemploy other than acid mediums. These subjects will be treated in a\r\nsubsequent section of the book.\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF COAGULANTS.--It is not proposed here to enter into a discussion\r\nas to the merits of the dozens of known coagulants. Suffice it to state\r\nthat acetic acid, although the oldest general coagulant, still remains the\r\nbest and safest at the present time. There is a deal to be said in favour\r\nof the use of another organic acid, formic acid. It is equally as safe as\r\nacetic acid, and quite efficacious; the only drawback is that, taking all\r\nthings into consideration, it is very slightly more expensive. Acetic acid,\r\ntherefore, will always be implied in this chapter when the word \"acid\" is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nSTRENGTH OF ACID SOLUTION.--In the old days it was the rule rather than the\r\nexception to find pure, undiluted acid used in coagulation. In many cases\r\nno harm resulted, for the simple reason that, owing to the large proportion\r\nof water in the latex, the acid was thereby very much diluted. The estates\r\nhad to thank the over-dilution of the latex for the non-injury of the\r\nresulting rubber.\r\n\r\nSome estates make up a stock solution of 1 part acid to 20 of water, and\r\nuse this with success because of the fair amount of added water present in\r\nthe latex.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that what is being referred to now is not the\r\nabsolute quantity necessary for coagulation, but the proportions--_i.e._,\r\nthe respective volumes of acid and water in the solution of acid made up\r\nevery day. That the strength of the acid solution, as well as the quantity\r\nused, has an effect upon coagulation can be easily demonstrated in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\nTake separate and equal lots of the same latex, and to each add the same\r\nquantity of pure acid, but in each case diluted with varying quantities of\r\nwater. It will be found that coagulation is quickest where pure acid is\r\nemployed, and slowest where the acid is most dilute. It will also be found\r\nthat, providing the quantity of acid employed was sufficient for\r\ncoagulation, the best and most uniform coagulation is obtained from the use\r\nof the most dilute acid, within limits. It will often be found that where\r\npure acid has been employed coagulation is local--_i.e._, we have lumpy\r\ncoagulation, and often a very milky remaining liquor. This is due to the\r\nfact that, as coagulation is immediate upon the spot which is first touched\r\nby the pure acid, a deal of the acid is enclosed within the rubber at that\r\nspot, and hence other portions of the latex are deprived of acid. It is in\r\nsuch cases that most air-bubbles are enclosed.\r\n\r\nAs the dilution of the acid solution is increased the mixing is more\r\nthorough and uniform. Coagulation is slower, and air-bubbles can escape to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MAKING STOCK SOLUTION.--Experiments have been repeatedly made in\r\nthe laboratory with acid solutions of varying dilution, from pure acid down\r\nto 1 part of acid in 500 parts of water. While it has been found that a 1\r\nin 5 solution can be used where the latex is very dilute (say, 1 part of\r\nlatex to 5 parts of water), and a 1 in 20 solution may be used in fairly\r\ndilute latex (for crepe-making), it is undoubtedly a fact that for latex as\r\ngenerally \"standardised\" on estates a much more dilute solution of acid\r\nshould be used--_e.g._, 1 in 100, or even 1 in 200, of water. It must be\r\nborne in mind that the quantity of acid necessary for coagulation is not\r\nchanged, but merely the dilution. Let us take a concrete case to illustrate\r\nthe point:\r\n\r\n     On an estate at present the stock solution is made up by diluting 1\r\n     pint of acid with 20 pints of water, and 1 gallon of this is necessary\r\n     to coagulate 50 gallons of pure latex.\r\n\r\n     It is desired to use a stock solution of 1 pint of acid to 100 pints\r\n     of water. Evidently, therefore, 5 gallons of this stock solution\r\n     contain only the same quantity of pure acid as 1 gallon of the old\r\n     solution contained, and it will be necessary to add 5 gallons for\r\n     every 50 gallons of pure latex. Thus:\r\n\r\n          1 to 20; 1 gallon necessary for 50 gallons pure latex.\r\n          1 to 100; 5 gallons necessary for 50 gallons pure latex.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that the quantities worked out in the foregoing\r\nexamples are not absolutely and mathematically correct, but they are quite\r\nclose enough for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\nIt may be advanced by someone that if a dilute solution of acid, such as 1\r\nin 100, is used the bulk of this stock solution (5 gallons to 50 gallons of\r\nlatex) is very great, and might be injurious to the quality of the\r\nresulting rubber. A moment's consideration will show that, after all, the\r\nvolume of acid solution is only one-tenth that of the volume of latex. This\r\ncan have no effect upon the quality of the rubber. Even dilution of the\r\npure latex with half its bulk of water in the factory will have no effect\r\nupon the quality of the resulting rubber. It is to be remembered that,\r\nexcept in cases where the proportion of added water to latex is absurdly\r\nlarge, the main argument against putting water into the latex-cups is\r\nagainst the possible poor quality of the water rather than against the\r\nactual small quantity theoretically added. It is acknowledged that, where\r\nthe water to be put into the cups can be guaranteed to be of good quality,\r\nno great objection would be raised against placing the smallest possible\r\nquantity of such water in the cups. But how many estates have such good\r\nwater easily available to the coolies, and how many estates can be sure\r\nthat only that smallest possible quantity would be used? It is a notorious\r\nfact that, even on estates where the quantity of water used was supposed to\r\nbe a minimum, the proportion of water to latex in some cups often exceeded\r\neven three or four to one. In any case it may be stated as an elementary\r\ntruism that the absence of water is more to be desired than water of\r\ndoubtful quality.\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF ACID.--As a result of repeated experimental work it has been\r\nfound that, for pure average latex, the quantity of acid necessary for\r\ncomplete coagulation, reckoned in parts of pure acid to parts of latex, is:\r\n\r\n     1 part pure acid; 1,000 parts average latex.\r\n\r\nWhere the latex is rather richer than average (above 30 per cent. dry\r\nrubber) probably a little more acid would be required, and similarly if the\r\ndry rubber content is lower the quantity of acid must be less.\r\n\r\nIt used to be a common belief that the more dilute the latex the greater\r\nthe quantity of acid necessary, but this would only apply to cases of\r\nextreme dilution of latex.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, up to certain limits of added water, the reverse is\r\nactually the case--_i.e._, the more water in the latex the less acid must\r\nbe added, assuming that for pure latex the proportion of pure acid to latex\r\nis taken as 1 part to 1,000 parts. This was found to be the case up to\r\ndilutions of three or four times the volume of latex. To take concrete\r\nexamples which will perhaps make the truth more clear:\r\n\r\n     Assuming we commence by making up our stock solution of acid by adding\r\n     100 parts of water to 1 part of pure acid, this gives us a mixture of\r\n     1 to 100. For 1 gallon of pure latex it would be necessary to add\r\n     one-tenth of its volume of the above mixture--_i.e._, 16 ozs.\r\n\r\n     Suppose we take a gallon of pure latex and add a gallon of water, we\r\n     now have 2 gallons of so-called latex. But we still have only 1 gallon\r\n     of real latex present in the diluted latex, and it is only necessary\r\n     to add sufficient acid to coagulate this gallon--_i.e._, 16 ozs.\r\n\r\n     Further, if 1 gallon of latex be diluted with 2, 3, or even 4 gallons\r\n     of water it is still only necessary to add 16 ozs. of the acid\r\n     mixture.\r\n\r\n     At dilutions beyond this limit, however, it is necessary to add a\r\n     little more acid to obtain complete coagulation.\r\n\r\nIn the process of preparing sheet rubber it is very necessary to see that\r\nthe minimum quantity of acid is used, otherwise visible defects are caused.\r\nBut in coagulating latex intended for preparing crepe, where the rubber\r\nundergoes protracted washing on the machines, the presence of a slight\r\nexcess of acid in coagulation is not calculated to cause any deterioration\r\nin the quality of the rubber. Advantage must not be taken of this statement\r\nto argue that more than a slight excess may be used without injury to the\r\nrubber, as it can be shown that the use of a large excess of acid results\r\nin an inferior rubber.\r\n\r\nQUANTITIES NECESSARY FOR MODERN REQUIREMENTS.--It may be commended to the\r\nnotice of the beginner that any further experimental work as to the\r\nquantity of acetic acid necessary for complete coagulation would only\r\ninvolve a waste of time and energy.\r\n\r\nThe general figure given in a preceding paragraph (1 part pure acid to\r\n1,000 parts of latex) may be accepted as the rough basis for working. In\r\nmodern practice, however, undiluted latex is usually diluted to a standard\r\nwhich may vary on different estates from 1-1/4 lbs. to 1-1/2 lbs. dry\r\nrubber per gallon.\r\n\r\nLatices of these strengths can be coagulated at a ratio of 1 part pure acid\r\nto 1,200 parts of standardised latex; and this quantity need not be\r\nexceeded, except in cases where an appreciable amount of some\r\nanti-coagulant is present in the latex. The proportion may then be raised\r\nto 1 in 1,000.\r\n\r\nIf considered advisable the acid may be used in a 1/2 per cent. solution\r\nfor sheet preparation; but in any case it is advised for the sake of\r\nuniformity that a 1 per cent. solution should be employed in the\r\npreparation of both sheet rubber and crepe rubber. In most modern\r\nfactories, measuring vessels of various capacities are to be found, and it\r\nis always more satisfactory to have the solution made up in approximately\r\ncorrect strength at the rate of 1 oz. of pure acid to 5 pints of water.\r\nOften, however, on some estates European supervision of this work is not\r\npossible, and the preparation of the acid solution has to be left in the\r\nhands of a (more or less) skilled coolie. It is thus necessary to find some\r\nless fine, but still approximately correct, method of procedure. In the\r\nEast the kerosene tin is in universal favour for the carriage of water, and\r\nthere is no reason why it should not be utilised as a standard measure for\r\npreparing the dilute acid solution, _providing it is not allowed to become\r\nrusty_. The capacity of the tin is 4 gallons (640 fluid ozs.), so that a\r\none-hundredth part would be approximately 6-1/2 ozs. It is suggested that\r\nthis quantity should be measured out by means of a glass graduated vessel,\r\nand then that an aluminium cup should be cut down so as to hold the exact\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the making of a solution, sufficiently approximate to 1\r\nper cent. strength for all practical purposes, into a simple operation of\r\nmixing pure acid and water in the ratio of one cupful of acid to 1 kerosene\r\ntin of water.\r\n\r\nThe actual quantity of solution required for the coagulation of any volume\r\nof standardised latex can be calculated easily from the ratio 1:1,200. As\r\nthe strength of solution is 1:100 it will be seen that the quantity to be\r\ntaken is _always one-twelfth_ that of the volume of latex--_e.g._:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) If the latex tank holds 90 gallons of standardised latex, 7-1/2\r\n     gallons of dilute acid solution are required.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) A tank containing 120 gallons of latex would need 10 gallons of\r\n     the 1 per cent. acid solution.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that all estates, not only in the preparation of sheet\r\nrubber, but also in the making of crepe rubber, always employ the system of\r\nstandardising latex in order to obtain uniformity. They are ill-advised if\r\nthey do not follow this practice; but in case average undiluted latex is\r\ntreated in coagulation, the quantity of acetic acid to be used should be\r\ncalculated from the ratio 1:1,000.\r\n\r\nIf the acid solution is to be employed in 1 per cent. strength, _one-tenth_\r\nof the volume of latex to be treated will indicate the required quantity of\r\nsolution necessary for complete coagulation unless anti-coagulants have\r\nbeen used, when the quantity must be increased as experience directs. It\r\nwill be recognised, of course, that undiluted latex may only be used in any\r\ncase for the preparation of crepe rubber; or in some exceptional case, such\r\nas the special preparation of \"slab\" rubber.\r\n\r\nCARE IN MIXING.--It is essential that the mixture of dilute acid and latex\r\nshould be thoroughly intimate. This can only be attained by careful\r\nmanipulation, especially in the case of sheet preparation. Where crepe\r\nrubber is to be made it may be permissible to employ a solution stronger\r\nthan 1 per cent., but it is not advised. The acid should be poured into\r\nthe latex while stirring, and the agitation should continue for such a\r\nperiod as to ensure thorough mixing in all parts.\r\n\r\nIt will be appreciated that in the preparation of sheet rubber this period\r\nmay not be unduly prolonged, otherwise the latex will have begun to\r\ncoagulate before skimming and the placing of the partitions in their\r\nrespective slots can be effected. Furthermore, while in the preliminary\r\ntreatment for crepe rubber, the formation of enclosed bubbles and surface\r\nfroth is immaterial. For sheet preparation it is essential that the\r\nstirring shall be done so carefully as to try to avoid internal bubbles and\r\nto reduce surface froth to a minimum. For crepe-making a perforated board,\r\nwith handle attached at right angles to the face of the board, may be used;\r\nbut in shallow sheet-coagulating tanks, broad paddles (which may or may not\r\nbe perforated) give good results as long as there is a sufficient number\r\nused to cover the area of the tank in reasonable time. Obviously also,\r\nwhere the area of any tank or compartment is of any appreciable size, the\r\ndilute acid solution should be poured in from various points so as to\r\nobtain a good even distribution. In some cases the acid is distributed from\r\na sprinkling can, but this is a refinement which experience shows to be\r\nunnecessary. In actual practice, working on a tank measuring 12 ft. by 4\r\nft., no difficulty is found if coolies pour in acid solution from four\r\npoints. The degree of success depends entirely upon experience and\r\nefficient supervision. This remark applies equally to the use of various\r\ndevices, such as rakes with broad teeth, used as stirring implements. There\r\nis room for display of ingenuity in this direction, and it is found often\r\nthat, while they are used successfully on one estate, they may be condemned\r\non another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO VIEWS OF DILUTION AND MIXING TANKS.\r\n\r\nBelow, on the right, coagulating tanks. At the far end strainers. Each\r\ndilution tank is of equal capacity to the corresponding coagulating tank.]\r\n\r\nUSE OF SODIUM BISULPHITE.--Some few years ago a demand for pale crepe\r\nrubbers sprang up, and this demand has been maintained. The total quantity\r\nof pale rubber put on the market previously could only have amounted to\r\nvery little, and that little was obtained by luck and various tricks in\r\nmanipulation. It must be premised that if coagulation is allowed to take\r\nplace, either naturally or with the aid of acetic acid, the resulting\r\nrubber will almost inevitably oxidise on the surface, except in the cases\r\nof very dilute or young latices. Even supposing that this darkening of the\r\nsurface does not take place in the wet stage, it is often found that a\r\nrubber expected to dry to a pale colour does not fulfil expectations, and a\r\ndull neutral shade results. This darkening of crepe rubber may be\r\nattributed to a slow process of oxidation, which continues until the rubber\r\nis dry. From these remarks it will be seen that the process of oxidation is\r\na natural one, and that any pale rubber formerly shipped was the outcome of\r\ncircumstances outside the control of the estate, except in such cases where\r\nboiling of the coagulum, etc., was resorted to. The fact that one rubber\r\nhappened to be a shade darker than another was absolutely no criterion as\r\nto the value of the rubber, but apparently the market thought, and still\r\nthinks, otherwise, although the actual necessities of manufacturers for a\r\npale crepe to be employed in special processes must be comparatively small.\r\n\r\nThe prevention of this natural oxidation was a problem which exercised the\r\nminds of all responsible for the preparation of pale rubbers, and much time\r\nand thought were expended upon it. Various theories were propounded, and\r\nthe chief conclusion arrived at was that the darkening of rubber was to be\r\nprevented by excluding all the light possible from the drying houses. To\r\nthis end windows were to be kept shut, or else they were provided with\r\nruby-coloured glass, which incidentally kept out the air. In spite of these\r\nprecautions, little success attended the expenditure of so much energy and\r\nthought. It was absolutely necessary that some chemical agent should be\r\ndiscovered which would make the preparation of pale crepe possible for any\r\nestate. This chemical would have to fulfil several requirements before it\r\ncould become popular:\r\n\r\n     1. It must be a simple substance capable of being easily handled.\r\n\r\n     2. It must be very soluble, so that solutions could easily be made up\r\n     by inexpert workers.\r\n\r\n     3. It must be cheap.\r\n\r\n     4. It must be quite innocent of any harmful effect upon the quality of\r\n     the rubber.\r\n\r\nAfter months of investigation into the properties of other chemicals the\r\nwriters decided that the only one which satisfactorily answered all\r\nrequirements was sodium bisulphite. The writers make no pretension to any\r\nclaim of having discovered the properties of this substance, which was a\r\ncommon chemical, and widely known. Even its action on latex was suspected\r\nbefore they engaged upon the work. These matters are only mentioned because\r\nthe credit, if any, should be given to the laboratories of the Rubber\r\nGrowers' Association.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it began to be known on the market that sodium bisulphite was\r\nbeing used in the preparation of pale crepe, a great outcry was made, and\r\nestates were warned that no more rubber prepared in this way would be\r\naccepted. It was said that the chemical would destroy the \"nerve\" of the\r\nrubber,[2] and it was definitely stated that rubber prepared with this\r\nchemical was brittle. It must be remembered that brokers had some\r\nlegitimate excuse in raising objections to the introduction of new and\r\nstrange chemicals for preparing rubber, as they were quite without means of\r\njudging whether the rubber had suffered harm or not. Still, on the other\r\nhand, private tests had been made in conjunction with Messrs. Beadle and\r\nStevens for fully eight months before the name of the chemical was\r\nmentioned in reports, and they had decided from the results of\r\nvulcanisation tests that the chemical was quite innocuous. Then, and only\r\nthen, did we consider it advisable to recommend the use of sodium\r\nbisulphite in general estate practice. Owing to the initial prejudice\r\nagainst rubber prepared with sodium bisulphite, the results of our\r\npreliminary work were published by permission of the Rubber Growers'\r\nAssociation.[3] The original instructions to estates regarding the proper\r\nemployment of this chemical were given in the private reports issued by the\r\nRubber Growers' Association in 1911. At the present time it is probably\r\naccurate to state that it is now used by all estates preparing fine crepes.\r\nRepresentatives of manufacturers have sometimes given us to understand\r\nthat the question of paleness of colour in such rubber is of no such\r\nimportance as is impressed upon us as producers. While we are prepared to\r\nbelieve, we can only plead that from our point of view the supply arises\r\nfrom the demand. Such are the conditions governing the sale of rubber that,\r\nirrespective of the requirements of the ultimate user, we have to market\r\nrubber which is valued almost completely upon its appearance at the time of\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n[2] Williams, International Rubber and Allied Congress, London, 1914.\r\n\r\n[3] \"The Employment of Sodium Bisulphite in the Preparation of Plantation\r\nRubber,\" Beadle, Stevens, and Morgan, _India-rubber Journal_, August 2,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\nAs long as such conditions prevail estates must continue to adopt any\r\ndevice of proved harmlessness, in order to obtain the best possible price\r\nfor their product, and not because we desire to continue a practice which\r\nsome assure us to be unnecessary, and which, moreover, adds somewhat to the\r\ncost of production.\r\n\r\nQUANTITIES OF SODIUM BISULPHITE.--It must be premised that, although sodium\r\nbisulphite is employed on some few estates in the preparation of sheet\r\nrubber, we do not advise the practice. It is unnecessary, and may lead to\r\nsome little trouble and delay in drying. In any case, sodium sulphite gives\r\nthe results desired for sheet rubber (see following). It must be\r\nunderstood, therefore, that we are concerned here, in the case of sodium\r\nbisulphite, with its employment in the preparation of fine pale crepe only.\r\n\r\nAs the dry rubber contents of latices vary with the age of the trees, the\r\ngeneral health of the trees, the seasons and general climatic conditions,\r\nthe relative strain imposed by depletion of reserves through tapping, etc.,\r\nit will be clear that the effect produced by a definite quantity of sodium\r\nbisulphite in any given volume of latex will also vary--_i.e._, the effect\r\ndepends upon the potential amount of rubber present. A dilute latex needs\r\nless sodium bisulphite than a richer latex to produce the same effect in\r\ncolour.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] Incidentally there are certain occasions, as in the opening of areas of\r\nbark rested for long periods, when the latex is of a rich yellow colour.\r\nSodium bisulphite will not \"bleach\" this colour, and it is well to remark\r\nagain at this stage that the action of the chemical is only to avoid or\r\narrest oxidation (darkening).\r\n\r\nHence it follows that if in any factory uniform quantities of the solution\r\nare used for any given volume of undiluted latices from different areas of\r\nthe estate, the effect upon the dry rubbers will vary. This explains why\r\nsome estates obtain different shades of rubber in their fine pale crepes.\r\n\r\nThe remedy obviously is to reduce the variation in latices by diluting them\r\nall to a standard rubber content as is done in sheet preparation. One is\r\nthus assured that the prescribed quantities of sodium bisulphite will meet\r\nrequirements in every case, and that waste will be avoided.\r\n\r\nWorking with a standard of 1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon the following\r\nformula should serve as a _maximum_:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Use of Sodium Bisulphite._\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Dissolve sodium bisulphite in water at the rate of 1 lb. to 10\r\n     gallons.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Of this solution use 1 gallon to every 10 gallons of latex.\r\n\r\nMAKING A SOLUTION.--The making of a solution of the chemical would seem to\r\nbe a simple matter, but to judge by the ill-effects sometimes observed in\r\nthe dry rubber the simplicity of the operation appears to have been\r\noverrated. Great care must be exercised in preparing the solution, and the\r\nwork should not be left to the few minutes preceding its actual\r\nrequirement; such has been found to be the case in several factories, so\r\nthat it is not surprising if the rubber is defective.\r\n\r\nThe powder should be added gradually to water with thorough stirring, which\r\nshould be continued for five minutes at least. Even then there may often be\r\nseen at the bottom undissolved particles, sand, and other impurity. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, in such cases to decant the solution through a piece\r\nof cotton cloth before using. No solid particles should be allowed to enter\r\nthe latex.\r\n\r\nABUSE OF SODIUM BISULPHITE.--It is now generally recognised that the abuse\r\nof sodium bisulphite, in the form of an excess, leads mainly to delay in\r\nthe period of drying and the production of an overpale rubber.[5] It is\r\nprobable that few estates, if any, now experience trouble due to this\r\nnon-observance of the rules and quantities laid down for use.\r\n\r\n[5] \"The Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" Morgan, 1913, p. 74.\r\n\r\nRESIDUAL TRACES OF SODIUM BISULPHITE.--The prolongation of the drying\r\nperiod was attributed to the fact that traces of substances caused by the\r\ndecomposition of sodium bisulphite remained in the rubber if the rubber\r\nwere not sufficiently worked and washed on the rolls. These traces must\r\nhave been very minute, but they were sufficient to retard the progress of\r\ndrying. That much depended on the care exercised in washing is evident from\r\nthe fact that samples prepared with varying quantities of the chemical show\r\nvarying results on extraction. These samples were tested for the presence\r\nof sulphates. Of the series tested that sample prepared with bisulphite in\r\nthe proportion of 1 part to 600 parts latex showed only a trace of sulphate\r\npresent; while the one prepared 1:2,400 gave an equal quantity.\r\nIntermediate samples contained no trace of sulphate. On the whole,\r\ntherefore, the presence of sulphate in crepe rubber is adventitious, and\r\nproperly washed crepe prepared with moderate quantities of bisulphite may\r\nbe taken as free from any residual quantities. Meanwhile there cannot\r\npossibly be any doubt of the advantages gained by the use of sodium\r\nbisulphite, and it would not be very wide of the mark if the statement were\r\nmade that, in the event of this chemical being discarded, most contracts\r\nfor pale crepe could not be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nSODIUM SULPHITE.--It would not be amiss to insist upon the point that while\r\nthe nature of sodium _bisulphite_, as employed in the preparation of\r\nrubber, is anti-oxidant, sodium sulphite is employed chiefly for its\r\nanti-coagulant property. It is not used, therefore, in the making of crepe\r\nrubber, but is of service in the preparation of sheet rubber, where the aim\r\nis to keep the latex in good fluid condition as long as is necessary, and\r\nto retard coagulation slightly so that enclosed bubbles of gas or air may\r\nescape. Formulae have been given for its use in the field when required. On\r\nsome estates this practice is not found necessary, but a quantity of\r\nsolution is always placed in the bottom of the reception vessels prior to\r\nthe straining of latex into them. Only a small quantity is used, and as a\r\nworking basis the following formula may be adopted:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sodium Sulphite: For Use in the Factory._\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Dissolve 2 ozs. of anhydrous sodium sulphite in a gallon of\r\n     water.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The gallon of solution, placed in the bottom of the reception\r\n     jar or tank, is sufficient for the treatment of 40 gallons of\r\n     standardised latex (1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon).\r\n\r\nThe warning previously given regarding the necessity for thoroughness in\r\nthe preparation of solutions is here reiterated. Stirring should be\r\nthorough, say for five minutes, and if there is any sediment or undissolved\r\nmatter the solution should be strained through cloth before using.\r\n\r\nWhere uniform jars or tanks are in use, the majority of which will contain\r\nuniform quantities of latex daily, the practice of using the chemical can\r\nbe made almost fool-proof even in the hands of coolies. A calculation is\r\nmade of the quantity of powder required for each vessel daily. The\r\nnecessary number of lots is weighed out each morning and each placed in an\r\nenvelope. The process is thus simplified by the fact that the contents of\r\nan envelope, neither more nor less, are required for each unit reception\r\nvessel. Even the weighing can be done by a coolie if he is given a\r\ncounterpoise (of lead, for example) equivalent to the required weight.\r\n\r\nIt will not be found necessary to do any vigorous stirring of the solution\r\nwith the latex, as the latter is strained into the solution and the\r\ncontinued addition of successive quantities is sufficient to give a good\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\nUSE OF FORMALIN.--Few estates now use formalin (formaldehyde) as an\r\nanti-coagulant. It must be acknowledged that when not abused there are\r\npoints in favour of its employment in preference to sodium sulphite, but\r\nthese are outbalanced by certain disadvantages. The argument may be stated\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     _Points for_: (1) If made up freshly it is an effective\r\n     anti-coagulant.\r\n\r\n     (2) Formalin being the solution of a gas in water, there is no\r\n     residual substance left in the rubber to delay drying.\r\n\r\n     (3) Its use gives a bright clear rubber.\r\n\r\n     _Points against_: (1) Its cost at all times is greater than that of\r\n     sodium sulphite.\r\n\r\n     (2) If the jar is not sealed there is loss by evaporation, thus\r\n     increasing the cost.\r\n\r\n     (3) Its effect upon the rubber is uncertain. Even in normal quantity\r\n     it is said to cause \"brittleness\" or \"shortness.\"\r\n\r\nCertain few estates, however, have continued its use, and no trouble is\r\nclaimed to ensue. The following formula is stated to give satisfactory\r\nresults in the preparation of sheet rubber, when applied as in the\r\npreceding paragraphs bearing on the employment of sodium sulphite:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for Use of Formalin (Formaldehyde)._\r\n\r\n     (_a_) 1 pint of formalin is diluted with 5 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Of this solution 1 gallon is required for 50 gallons of\r\n     standardised latex.\r\n\r\nIn noting this formula the writer gives no recommendation regarding its\r\nuse. Whatever may be the actual facts regarding the effect of formalin upon\r\nthe vulcanisation of rubber, when used in minimum proportions, there can be\r\nno question concerning its injurious effect if used in excess. Beyond this\r\nthe factors of cost and loss militate against its wider employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_PREPARATION OF SHEET RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nPALE SHEET.--The first form in which plantation rubber was prepared was as\r\n\"biscuits\" or sheets. This form remained in favour for some years. The\r\nfirst biscuits or sheets were rather dark in colour owing to the natural\r\noxidation which followed. Then it was discovered that by diluting the latex\r\nthe degree of oxidation was diminished, and later it was found that if the\r\nsoft coagulum were placed in almost boiling water for a short time the\r\nresulting rubber was pale. Thus there arose gradually a demand for pale\r\nsheet. With our present knowledge we are in a position to state that the\r\npale biscuits were not in any way superior to the darker ones, and they\r\nwere in most cases actually inferior.\r\n\r\nIt was found also as time progressed that sheet rubber, on air-drying,\r\nbecame covered with external surface moulds, and that, more often than not,\r\nthe smell of the drying rubber was the reverse of pleasant. Even when dry\r\nthe sheets had to be continually brushed free from moulds, and by the time\r\nthe rubber reached the market it was again usually mouldy. Such are, even\r\nnow, the handicaps under which those who prepare pale sheets have to\r\nlabour. Few, however, are the estates making pale sheets, and they are\r\nconfined almost entirely to native holdings.\r\n\r\nTo those accustomed only to the preparation of crepe rubber, where\r\ncoagulation can be effected in large batches, the preparation of sheet\r\nrubber always seems to demand much more labour. As a matter of fact,\r\nalthough the preliminary operations certainly do demand more care and\r\nlabour than in crepe-making, there are compensating advantages in the\r\nmachining stage. For the preparation of sheet of the highest quality on any\r\nbut the largest scale, elaborate installations of machinery are quite\r\nsuperfluous, as equal results can be obtained with pairs of rolls worked by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITY OF PRODUCT.--There will be no need to enter again into a\r\ndiscussion of the preliminary operations of receiving and straining latex\r\nfor sheet-making. They have been fully dealt with in Chapter VII. It used\r\nto be the general custom to mix the acid and latex in each individual dish,\r\nand in some small or non-progressive factories that is still the procedure.\r\nQuite apart from the question of labour entailed, the process is quite\r\nunnecessary. Even if comparatively small volumes of latex are handled,\r\nstandardisation by dilution should be the rule, and the acid solution\r\nshould be added to the bulk. It is possible to stir in the acid and to\r\nladle out uniform quantities in each pan or dish from a bulk volume of up\r\nto 40 gallons if the organisation is efficient.\r\n\r\nOn any but a small scale the labour entailed in the handling and cleaning\r\nof pans is excessive, and shallow tanks are now employed on most estates.\r\nThe reception and standardisation of latex by dilution has already been\r\ndiscussed in Chapter VII. The combination of this practice with the\r\nemployment of shallow coagulating tanks has simplified working and reduced\r\nthe cost of labour. It is not intended to enter into any lengthy discussion\r\nrelative to the merits of sheets made in pans as against those made in\r\ntanks. It is granted that it is possible to make a \"pan\" sheet superior in\r\nappearance to the general average of \"tank\" sheets; but from an economic\r\nstandpoint the introduction of the use of tanks into all but the smallest\r\nfactories is only a matter of time, if the demand for this class of rubber\r\npersists.\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL TANK.--Even the most modern installations of sheet-coagulating\r\ntanks must be regarded as merely temporary devices, as, given facilities,\r\nthe room for improvement is so wide.\r\n\r\nThe first tanks made erred in being too large, and as the result of\r\nexperience the size of units has now been reduced to a maximum of 12 feet\r\nby 4 feet by 1 foot deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIT MODERN COAGULATING TANK (TWO VIEWS).\r\n\r\nConstruction of brick and cement with lining of glazed tiles. Note slots\r\nincorporated in side tiles. Partition boards in piles in the background.]\r\n\r\nTanks are at present constructed either of hard timber or of brick and\r\ncement faced with glazed tiles; both types have inherent drawbacks. The\r\nwooden tanks are difficult to keep clean and in \"sweet\" condition. The\r\nglazed tiles, unless extremely well laid, allow the acid serum (from which\r\nthe rubber is removed) to percolate between the interstices. Thus \"pockets\"\r\nof liquid collect beneath the tiles, and in process of the decomposition of\r\ncertain constituents dissolved in the serum evil-smelling gases are set\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER BATTERY OF TANKS, WITH DILUTION TANKS, RAISED, ON\r\nTHE RIGHT.\r\n\r\nNote drainage cocks, chute, and sieve in position.]\r\n\r\nIt should not be a matter of difficulty for manufacturers to make sheets of\r\nthick glass sufficiently large to form the bed-plate and side-pieces\r\nnecessary in the lining of a tank. If such adjuncts could be secured, the\r\ndisabilities indicated above would be perhaps wholly removed. Unless there\r\nis a demand from estates, however, it is idle to expect a supply to be\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\nAn even greater improvement would take the form of unit tanks cast in\r\nglazed white-ware with the necessary slots incorporated in the sides. At\r\npresent no known firm makes such tanks of sufficient size. A unit could\r\nmeasure (internally) 6 feet by 4 feet by 1 foot deep, with slots 1-1/2\r\ninches apart, and 3/8 inch in width. The tanks might be reinforced with\r\niron bars, so that they could either be used alone or embedded in the usual\r\nbrick structure. The junctions of the bed-plate and side-pieces could be\r\nfinely rounded so as to facilitate cleaning, and at one end a draining-hole\r\ncould be made, say, 1 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLOSER VIEW OF FOREGOING.\r\n\r\nNote partitions in position and coagulum being removed.]\r\n\r\nMeantime both the hard-wood tanks and those of glazed tiles find their\r\nparticular applications. The former is generally employed in smaller\r\nfactories, or where future large increases of crop preclude the present\r\ninstallation of a fixed system. The latter find use in large factories, or\r\nwhere no new areas remain to come into bearing.\r\n\r\nMODERN INSTALLATION.--As an example of a modern installation of coagulating\r\ntanks, we can do no better than offer reproductions of the system now in\r\nuse on Pataling Estate.\r\n\r\nA warning must be given against employing all tanks of stone-ware or cement\r\nunless well glazed. Almost without exception, irrespective of the material\r\nused in the construction of coagulating tanks, wooden partitions are\r\nemployed. In the few exceptional cases the partitions are either of glass\r\nor of aluminium. The former would appear to be the ideal substance, were it\r\nnot for initial cost and loss by breakage. These disabilities may possibly\r\nbe overcome in course of time.\r\n\r\nCARE OF TANKS.--The use of aluminium would have been wider had it not been\r\nfor lack of supplies and the question of cost during the War. A novel\r\nmethod of employing aluminium partitions was introduced in the factory of\r\nTremelbye Estate. There were no slots in the sides of the glazed-tile\r\ntanks, but the necessary slots were very ingeniously created by means of\r\naluminium \"distance-pieces,\" the two long edges of which were turned at\r\nright angles to the face of each piece to a depth of about 1/4 inch. The\r\nends of the thin aluminium partition moved in the slot thus formed between\r\ntwo adjacent \"distance-pieces.\" The friction between the surfaces was\r\nsufficient to allow all the partitions, when in position, to be raised well\r\nabove the floor of the tank, so that a uniform level of latex was obtained.\r\nSlight hand-pressure only was then required to push the partitions down.\r\n\r\nNaturally the cleansing of glass or aluminium partitions presents no\r\ndifficulty, but in the case of wood failure to ensure thorough cleanliness\r\nleads to possible defects in the finished dry rubber. Provided the wood\r\ncould be made waterproof, no trouble would ensue, and hence various\r\nmeasures have been tried with that object in view. When new the boards have\r\nbeen surface-waxed or varnished, and the treatment has been repeated on\r\noccasions. But in course of time the surface film of waterproof material\r\nhas disappeared, partially or wholly, and the trouble recurs. When\r\npartitions become sodden with serum, the surfaces are liable to be coated\r\nwith a slime, consisting largely of organic growths which have an effect\r\nupon the latex, causing \"pitting\" on the surface of the coagulum and\r\nenclosed bubbles within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANOTHER BATTERY OF TANKS, WITHOUT DILUTION TANKS OR MEANS OF\r\nGRAVITATING LATEX.]\r\n\r\nIt is recommended, therefore, that wooden tanks, after ordinary cleansing\r\ndaily, should be swabbed out with a 5 per cent. solution of sodium\r\nbisulphite. Wooden partitions should receive the same treatment, and once a\r\nweek at least (or every day if possible) they should be placed in the sun\r\nfor an hour or two, care being taken that both sides of a partition are\r\nexposed in turn. Before being placed in the latex, all wooden partitions\r\nshould be made wet on the surfaces.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the writers had made a partition of vulcanite, which\r\napparently would have proved of great service but for the initial cost. The\r\nadvent of the War put the matter out of the question, but it is possible\r\nnow that such a material would be worthy of extended trial. Except in the\r\nmatter of cost, it would appear to have advantages over any substance yet\r\ntried; and if it were possible for estates to supply their own lower grade\r\nrubbers direct, the cost might be reduced considerably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHEETING TANK CONTAINING COAGULUM FOR CREPE PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nBehind wall in background are the tanks in which latex is standardized.\r\nNote vent, to the left, through which latex flows and wooden \"stopper\" on\r\nedge of tank.]\r\n\r\nSTANDARD LATEX.--Enough has been written (see Chapter VII.) to familiarise\r\nthe reader with the use of this term for the description of latex diluted\r\ndaily to a level of dry rubber content. Whatever may be the practice\r\nelsewhere, it is now fairly general on estates in Malaya to reduce all\r\nlatices to a uniform \"strength\" for the preparation of sheet rubber. It is\r\nclaimed that only in this manner can uniformity of product be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a standard has been the outcome of general experience. It\r\nhas been found that if too high a standard is taken difficulties arise,\r\nsuch as (1) unsatisfactory and uneven coagulation, (2) too thick a coagulum\r\nfor easy working in general, (3) too extended a period of drying and\r\nsmoke-curing, and hence too dark a colour in the finished rubber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A \"BATTERY\" OF SHEETING TANKS (PATALING ESTATE). DILUTION\r\nTANKS, RAISED, ON THE LEFT.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, too low a standard also brings trouble in its train. The\r\ncoagulum is too porous, will not stand handling, and the resultant sheet is\r\ntoo thin unless an abnormal thickness of coagulum is prepared. Furthermore,\r\nover-dilution means an increase in the number of tanks required for any\r\noriginal volume of latex. This involves an increase in floor area, and\r\nperhaps in the size of the building. The soft sheets, when rolled, may\r\nspread to such a width as to cause the edges to be squeezed under the\r\ncheek-blocks of the machines, etc.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes, whether sheets are prepared in pans or in\r\ntanks, it has been found that the optimum results are obtained by the\r\nadoption of a standard approximating and not exceeding 1-1/2 lbs. dry\r\nrubber per gallon. Primarily this standard has a direct connection and\r\ninterdependence with the distance between the partitions (or between the\r\nslots) in coagulating tanks. The distance found most practicable is 1-1/2\r\ninches. This thickness of coagulum, when prepared from latex not exceeding\r\na standard of 1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon, is found to yield a very\r\nsatisfactory sheet in all respects.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that we have two possible main factors of variation:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Distance between partitions, causing visible differences in\r\n     thickness of coagulum.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Dry rubber content of latex, causing differences in the density\r\n     (_e.g._, hardness or softness) of the coagulum.\r\n\r\nThe effect of variation in (_a_) will be clear. Even when latex of a\r\nstandard of 1-1/2 lbs. per gallon is employed the resulting sheet may be\r\neither too thin or too thick.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, as already argued, the use of too low or too high a standard of\r\ndilution (when the factor of distance between partitions is not allowed to\r\nvary) is capable of causing much difficulty. While this is correct,\r\nbroadly, it is found in the experience of some estates that their\r\nrequirements are satisfied by a slightly lower standard than 1-1/2 lbs. per\r\ngallon. Thus it is not uncommon to note the adoption of a standard\r\nequivalent to 1 lb. 4 ozs. or 1 lb. 6 ozs. dry rubber per gallon.\r\nExperience dictates, however, that for the recognised standard measurements\r\nof modern tanks the practical limits of satisfactory density of latex lie\r\nbetween 1-1/4 lbs. and 1-1/2 lbs. per gallon.\r\n\r\nSTANDARDISING INSTRUMENTS.--For standardising latex by dilution all that is\r\nrequired is an instrument which will preserve a perpendicular position\r\nwhile floating in latex, will be sufficiently sensitive to indicate fairly\r\nsmall differences in density of latex, and has one mark on its aerial\r\nportion accurately indicating a density corresponding to the required\r\nstandard. On scientific grounds it can be demonstrated that such an\r\ninstrument as employed in common practice would not be strictly\r\naccurate.[6] It is not proposed, in this section of the book, to discuss\r\nsuch considerations.\r\n\r\n[6] De Vries, \"Archief voor de Rubbercultuur.\"\r\n\r\nInstruments of this nature are represented by the \"Metrolac\" (originating\r\nfrom the Rubber Growers' Association) and other similar recorders. They\r\ngenerally consist of a submersible bulb with a projecting stem which is\r\ngraduated. The \"Metrolac\" differs from others in that the bulb is of\r\ntorpedo form (thus reducing \"skin friction\"), and the graduations on the\r\nstem indicate actual weight of dry rubber per gallon instead of the\r\nordinary specific gravity figures.\r\n\r\nTheoretical considerations to the contrary, it is found in actual practice\r\nin Malaya and Ceylon that, although such instruments are naturally delicate\r\nand require careful manipulation, they are of considerable practical value\r\nand satisfy a definite requirement. Until an instrument of greater accuracy\r\nand equal simplicity can be discovered all estates should regard the\r\npossession of a few \"Metrolacs\" as essential.\r\n\r\nThe nature of their construction and the average conditions under which\r\nthey are used (and abused) make it impossible to rely upon their accuracy\r\nindefinitely or for any long period. It is always recommended, therefore,\r\nthat there should be at least two instruments available, one of which may\r\nbe in daily use, while the other is kept in safe custody and only employed,\r\nsay, once a week for purposes of checking the accuracy or degree of\r\ninaccuracy of the other. This can be done with reasonable approximity by\r\nplacing both instruments in a tall vessel containing well-mixed and diluted\r\nlatex. Instruments showing a marked degree of inaccuracy should not be\r\npreserved; but in cases of necessity \"Metrolacs\" from estates belonging to\r\ncompany members of the Rubber Growers' Association may be sent to the\r\nlaboratories for repair and adjustment.[7]\r\n\r\n[7] This applies to the gilt brass instruments. As the result of experiment\r\nthe Rubber Growers' Association are now introducing glass instruments.\r\nThese are necessarily more fragile, but while unbroken can be relied on to\r\ngive correct readings.\r\n\r\nWhere field coagulating stations have been instituted on estates, it is\r\nstrictly necessary that instruments should be provided in all cases; and it\r\nshould be a rule that these are tested and corrected weekly by a standard\r\ninstrument employed for that purpose only. This need was well recognised by\r\nmany estates when, during the War and the consequent shortage of supply of\r\n\"Metrolacs,\" a demand arose which was met in some degree by crude\r\ninstruments of local manufacture, such as that commonly known as the\r\n\"Castlefield bobber,\" contrived and made by the enterprising manager of the\r\nestate of that name. The demand for the more accurate instruments can now\r\nbe met.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF USING THE INSTRUMENTS.--The \"Metrolac\" was devised and\r\nintroduced by the writers on behalf of the Rubber Growers' Association, and\r\ndirections for its use were given. Tables were prepared by means of which\r\nsimple calculations for the dilution of any given latex could be made.\r\nThese did not find an extended application, inasmuch as in the majority of\r\ncases native workers only were in charge of the processes of rubber\r\npreparation. In point of fact, such calculations are not strictly\r\nnecessary, as the operation of standardising the latex can be done quite\r\nsimply and skilfully by a trained native. Latex as it reaches the store in\r\naverage weather from any particular division or field does not vary greatly\r\nin density. The trained coolie or foreman, basing his practice on\r\nexperience, adds to the latex a quantity of water, and then makes a first\r\ntest with the standardising instrument. Several additions of water (with\r\nthorough stirring) may have to be made before a test indicates that the\r\ncorrect density has been obtained, but it is surprising how quickly a\r\nskilled worker will arrive at the desired standard. Extreme or absolute\r\naccuracy is not insisted upon or desired, as avoidable delay is to be\r\ndeprecated, and the result in any case is sufficiently exact for practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nSKIMMING.--During the gravitation of the latex from the reception vessels\r\n(in which the standardising of the latex is effected) to the coagulating\r\ntanks, much surface froth is usually caused. This is best removed by means\r\nof a thin board of a width slightly less than the breadth of the tank. The\r\nskimmings are sometimes placed in pans and subsequently made into a second\r\ngrade of sheet rubber, or they receive treatment with a small proportion of\r\nsodium bisulphite and eventually appear as fine pale crepe. The practice\r\nvaries usually according to the form in which the general No. 1 grade is\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nOn some estates a great deal of the frothing is avoided by placing in\r\nposition at the receiving end of the tank a perforated partition. This\r\npartition may be made of wood, or of stout zinc (or aluminium) carrying ten\r\ncircular holes to the inch. Through this the latex percolates, while the\r\nfroth is retained on a small area. The froth is removed prior to the\r\naddition of the acid. After stirring in the acid solution most estates\r\nagain skim the surface of the latex; but if the stirring has been performed\r\nproperly there should be little froth. This, when it collapses, in any case\r\nwill appear only on the upper edge of the strip of coagulum, and after\r\nrolling should not be visible. It would appear, therefore, that the second\r\nskimming is not necessary.\r\n\r\nSTYLE OF SHEET.--Within the last few years the custom of making plain\r\nsheet--_i.e._, sheet having a plain surface--has gradually given place to\r\nthe preparation of ribbed sheet--_i.e._, sheet having a pattern marked on\r\nthe surface. It would probably be correct to say that plain (smooth) sheet\r\nis now only prepared by natives or by some estates just come into bearing.\r\nEven in the latter case there is no reason why smooth sheet should be made,\r\nas hand machines are sold which will do all the work required. It will be\r\nevident to anyone acquainted with rubber preparation that in the matter of\r\nactual quality of rubber the question of smoothness or a pattern can have\r\nno bearing on the result. One advantage claimed for ribbed sheet which may\r\nentirely justify the preference exhibited by consumers, relates to the\r\nquestion of packing. When rubber arrives at home it is frequently found to\r\nbe in an almost solid block, due to the pressure of the sheets superimposed\r\nin the case. The smoother the surfaces of the rubber in contact the greater\r\nthe adhesion and the denser will be the mass, and consequently the greater\r\nthe difficulty in separating individual pieces. Under such circumstances it\r\nis plain that the difficulty is diminished if the sheets have a raised\r\npattern on them. It is noted also that the liability to mildew-growth is\r\ngreater the smoother the surfaces of the rubber.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds the \"marking\" of sheet rubber is to be commended. These\r\nreasons apart, it is really astonishing the difference made in the\r\nappearance of the sheets by impressing upon them a ribbed pattern, and it\r\nis highly probable that the market value of the rubber is slightly\r\nincreased. It is not our duty to attempt to reason why this simple\r\noperation should increase the market value of sheet rubber; it is\r\nsufficient to recognise that it is so, and that money may be thrown away by\r\nneglecting to cater for the taste of the market. Of the patterns impressed\r\nupon sheet rubber there is a variety, but the general style is that known\r\nas the \"spirally close-cut ribbing.\"\r\n\r\nSTANDARD SHEET.--Leaving for the present the question of pattern of mark,\r\none cannot do better by way of introduction than to reproduce the\r\ninstructions[8] given generally to estates.\r\n\r\n[8] \"Handbook on Preparation of Rubber,\" Rubber Growers' Association, May,\r\n1917, p. 28.\r\n\r\nROLLING AND MARKING OF SHEET RUBBER.--Working with standard latex it is\r\nfound that strips of coagulum 1-1/2 inches in thickness require little\r\nrolling to produce sheets of desirable thickness.\r\n\r\n     (1) The sheets or strips are first given a preliminary rolling with a\r\n     heavy hand-roller made of hard wood. The roller is passed once in one\r\n     direction, and once in the reverse direction.\r\n\r\n     (2) The coagulum is then passed through smooth machines twice, once\r\n     with the rolls fairly open, and once with a narrower space. It is not\r\n     found advisable to close the smooth rolls so tightly that the rubber\r\n     is made too hard.\r\n\r\n     (3) The sheets or strips are then passed once through a pair of\r\n     marking rollers. Various types of patterns are used, but the one which\r\n     appears to give the most satisfactory results is that known as the\r\n     \"close-cut spiral.\" This produces the semblance of a small diamond\r\n     pattern on the rubber. The surface of the sheet is raised in\r\n     well-defined ridges, which appear to present the maximum drying\r\n     surface exposed to the atmosphere of the smoke-house. Thus, not only\r\n     is the appearance of the sheet rendered attractive, but also the\r\n     period of drying is reduced. Starting with standard latex and\r\n     following the procedure here described for rolling and marking, sheets\r\n     should be ready for packing in ten or eleven days. If the period is\r\n     longer, it is possible that the design or structure of the smoke-house\r\n     is at fault.\r\n\r\nWHEN TO WORK THE COAGULUM.--Before proceeding to discuss other points the\r\nquestion remains to be settled as to how long it may be necessary or\r\nadvisable to allow the coagulum to remain in the serum before rolling it.\r\nFor reasons of practical economy in factory working, it is usual to allow\r\nsheet rubber to remain over night, and the coagulum receives attention\r\nearly next morning. During the interval (averaging about eighteen hours),\r\nthe coagulum consolidates, leaving an almost clear serum if the correct\r\nquantity of acid has been added to the latex. Any but the very slightest\r\ntrace of milkiness in the serum indicates an insufficiency of coagulant. If\r\nthe serum is always definitely clear, there may be grounds for believing\r\nthat an excess is being used. If the quantity of coagulant has been\r\ncalculated to an average nicety, the serum should be just dubiously free\r\nfrom milkiness.\r\n\r\nThe firmness gained by the coagulum on standing in the serum overnight\r\nshould enable it to be handled next morning without any marked stretching,\r\nand in some estates the rubber is put direct through the first pair of\r\nsmooth rolls without a preliminary consolidation by means of hand-rolling.\r\n\r\nSome estates prefer to handle the coagulum while rather softer, as it is\r\nclaimed:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) That the coagulum is easier to work, and sheets of improved\r\n     appearance can be made.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) That there is greater freedom from \"bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n     (_c_) That the incidence of \"rust\" is lessened.\r\n\r\n     These claims are substantiated in practice; but in the case of the\r\n     third, it only holds provided that the rubber can be finished and\r\n     placed in the smoke-house almost as soon as the last sheet has been\r\n     machined.\r\n\r\nIn such cases all latex must reach the store comparatively early in the\r\nday--_e.g._, before noon. Three hours is allowed for coagulation, and the\r\nworking of the rubber is then commenced. As a general rule this means that\r\nthe operations of rolling and marking must be completed, a short interval\r\ngiven for dripping, weighing must be done, and the rubber placed in the\r\nsmoke-house before night falls (as a rule about 6.30 p.m.).\r\n\r\nUnless factories dealing with a large crop are well equipped with\r\nartificial light, such a course is not open to them; in any case it remains\r\ntrue that night work should be avoided if possible. If, however, it can be\r\narranged without increasing the cost of production, there would appear to\r\nbe no objection to the early working of the coagulum as described above.\r\n\r\nHAND-ROLLING.--As already indicated, some few estates do not give the\r\nstrips of coagulum any preliminary hand-rolling, as the rubber is\r\nconsidered to be sufficiently firm to be handled into the first machine.\r\n\r\nOn most estates hand-rolling is found necessary, owing to the tendency of\r\nthe long strips to stretch unduly, giving badly shaped sheets. This\r\nhand-rolling should be done carefully, and is best effected on a specially\r\nconstructed table. This consists essentially of an inch-thick hard-wood\r\nplank about 2 inches wider, and 4 or 5 feet longer, than the strip of\r\ncoagulum. Along the edges of the plank, and at right angles to its upper\r\nflat surface, may be fastened strips of wood about 1/2 inch square in\r\nsection, thus forming a shallow tray open at either end. These strips serve\r\ntwo purposes:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) As the wooden roller is wider than the plank, they prevent the\r\n     coagulum being rolled too thin and too firm.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) They prevent the coagulum being squashed too wide, and tend to\r\n     keep the edges straight.\r\n\r\nTo avoid \"thick ends\" it is sometimes considered advisable to insert, at\r\neither end of the rolling table, shallow wedges about 6 inches long, of the\r\nsame width as the table (between the edge-strips), and with the sharp end\r\nof the wedge pointing in the direction of the length of the table. The ends\r\nof the coagulum are drawn up and finished on these inclined planes.\r\n\r\nThese points may appear to be extreme refinements, but as long as rubber is\r\nvalued on such grounds we must endeavour to meet the system imposed upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH-ROLLING.--It is advised that, after hand-rolling, the coagulum\r\nshould be passed through at least two machines having smooth-rolls. On some\r\nestates three such machines are employed. The purpose of this procedure is\r\nto reduce the thickness of the coagulum gradually. The same could be\r\neffected, of course, on one machine; but obviously the distance between the\r\nrolls would have to be readjusted at each operation and for each piece of\r\ncoagulum. Apart from the time thus wasted, there is the certainty, in view\r\nof the rough adjustment of the machines, that the chances of obtaining\r\nuniformly thick sheets would be slight.\r\n\r\nThe machines should be arranged as a battery, with the marking rolls at one\r\nend, so that the operations are consecutive. It is erroneous to imagine\r\nthat heavy machines (such as those used in crepe preparation) are required.\r\nLight machinery only is necessary for sheet-making; but any available heavy\r\nsmooth-roll machines in a crepeing battery may serve admirably for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMARKING.--Heavy machines are unnecessary for the purpose of putting a\r\npattern on sheet rubber. If the rubber has been properly prepared a light\r\npair of rolls is capable of exerting sufficient pressure to cause a good\r\nupstanding pattern.\r\n\r\nRolls are cut in various designs: some with \"diamond\" grooves on both\r\nrolls; some with grooves of varying width and depth encircling the\r\ncircumference of the rolls, thus creating a \"stripe\" effect on the rubber;\r\nand some with diagonally-cut spiral grooves placed closely together. The\r\nlast has the greatest vogue at present, while the first has almost gone out\r\nof favour. An objection lodged against the second design is that the edges\r\nof the grooves sometimes cut through the rubber, so that the dried sheet\r\ndivides in strips. It would appear in such instances that either the\r\ncoagulum was too thin and soft, or that the grooves had been cut too deeply\r\nand sharply. In any case the choice of a design is an arbitrary matter, and\r\nshould depend upon the effect produced on the rate of drying and the\r\ngeneral appearance.\r\n\r\nThe popular \"close-cut spiral\" roll is machined with varying measurements,\r\nbut the usual design has grooves 1/8 inch wide by 1/8 inch deep and 3/16\r\ninch apart.\r\n\r\nMany estates have a particular \"brand\" cut in the middle of the rolls for\r\npurposes of identification. If this is done it is advised that the main\r\ngrooving of the rolls be carried into the \"branding\" strip; otherwise grip\r\nwill be lacking on this portion, and a certain amount of \"cockling\" of the\r\nsheets will result.\r\n\r\nSheets are often seen in which the potential effect of the grooving is\r\nreduced to a comparatively flat pattern in place of the desired ridges. The\r\nfault is generally attributed to the shortcomings of the marking rolls.\r\nWhile it is true that the grooving often deteriorates by friction-wear when\r\nthe rolls are running \"free,\" experience generally decides that the\r\ndeficiency in the appearance of the rubber should be attributed to faulty\r\nprevious preparation rather than to the marking rolls. Sets of rolls have\r\nbeen changed often without justification or an improved result. It would\r\nalways be well to be certain first that the trouble did not emanate from\r\nthe fact that the coagulum had been previously rolled so thin and hard that\r\nthe rubber could not be squeezed so as to fill the grooves. This has been\r\nfound to be a common fault, and the general effect is to delay drying in\r\nspite of the thinness of the rubber.\r\n\r\nAgain, the trouble may have been due to an incorrect standardisation of the\r\nlatex, generally in the direction of too heavy a density (too rich a latex)\r\nbeing employed. The original thickness of the coagulum would be normal, but\r\nowing to the abnormal rubber-content the effect of passing through the\r\nsmooth rolls would be the production of a strip thicker and firmer than\r\nordinary. If this firmness is appreciable the resistance of the rubber to\r\nthe squeezing action of the marking rolls will result in a flat\r\npattern--_i.e._, the grooves cannot be filled, and the ridges are low.\r\n\r\nIt is advised that all rolls used in the preparation of sheet rubber should\r\nbe at least 18 inches wide, in order to avoid the appearance of thickened\r\nedges which delay drying.\r\n\r\nWorking with the correct standard of dilution of latex, and following the\r\nprocedure indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, the dry sheet should not\r\nexceed an average thickness (over ridges and depressions) of 1/8 inch.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR SMOKE-CURING.--It used to be the custom to allow sheet\r\nrubber to air-dry first for periods varying from one to several days.\r\nNaturally moulds were soon formed, and when the sheets were quite\r\nsmoke-cured a mass of the dead moulds could be seen, if not over the whole\r\nsheet, at least in the corners of each diamond mark. It has been\r\ndemonstrated in practice that there is no advantage in allowing sheets to\r\nair-dry partially before smoking. In fact, to obtain the greatest benefit\r\nfrom smoke-curing, sheet rubber should be placed in the smoke-house as soon\r\nas possible. The same effect of mould-growth may be noted if the wet sheets\r\nare placed in a smoke-house insufficiently heated.\r\n\r\nOther defects may arise which can be traced to faulty treatment of the\r\nmarked coagulum prior to hanging in the smoke-house and subsequent to\r\nrolling. These will be enlarged upon in a subsequent section of the book,\r\nand at present it will suffice to indicate the procedure which experience\r\ndirects as likely to give the best results.\r\n\r\nWhen the lengths of coagulum leave the marking machine they are usually\r\nlaid in piles containing two dozen or more strips. The piles are then cut\r\ninto the required lengths, the exact length generally being determined by\r\nthe available perpendicular distance between the supports in the\r\nsmoke-house. It is necessary to remark that the piles of sheets should not\r\nbe allowed to accumulate, but should be dealt with in subsequent treatment\r\nprogressively. If for some reason this is not possible, then all piles of\r\nsheets should be turned on edge so as to assist the draining away of the\r\nserum or \"mother-liquor,\" which continues to ooze from the rubber for some\r\ntime after the squeezing in the machines.\r\n\r\nWhere hot water is available the freshly cut sheets should be passed into\r\nit as soon as possible, and given a thoroughly good swilling. The caution\r\nmust be given that the hot water should be changed very frequently and, if\r\npossible, after every batch, say, of a hundred sheets.\r\n\r\nThe sheets should then be carried immediately to racks on which they are\r\nhung to drip. Generally these racks are situated under cover, but there is\r\nno reason why they should not be placed in the open air without cover or\r\nshade. From continued experience of this practice over a period of years it\r\nis found advantageous and to be preferred to the usual method of allowing\r\nsheets to drip under cover.\r\n\r\nWhile the sheets are fresh and loaded with internal moisture, the effect of\r\nsun-heat upon the surface, when exposed for, say, two hours, is nil; and\r\nthe safety of the process can be guaranteed, provided the stated limit is\r\nnot exceeded to an appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD METHOD OF \"DRIPPING\" FRESHLY ROLLED SHEETS WITHIN\r\nTHE FACTORY.]\r\n\r\nAfter dripping for an hour or so, the sheets should be placed in the\r\nsmoke-house. If it is a bright sunny day, no extra precautions need be\r\ntaken; but on cool, dull days it would be advisable to light the fires\r\nearlier than usual, consistent with the work required to be done in the\r\nhouse--_e.g._, in the removal of dry rubber. There would appear to be no\r\nreason why the dry sheets should not be first removed, so that on dull or\r\nwet days smoking can be commenced as soon as the wet rubber has been hung.\r\n\r\nOn a few estates where the smoke-houses are worked continuously, except for\r\na few hours in the morning, a portion of the building is separated by a\r\npartition for the reception of the wet rubber. The sheets are taken\r\ndirectly from the marking rolls and placed in the chamber, beneath which a\r\nfire is started. The sheets thus drip in a warm and smoke-laden atmosphere\r\nuntil next morning, when they are weighed and removed to the smoke-house\r\nproper. It is claimed that freedom from \"rust\" is thus obtained.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that in the treatment of the rubber preparatory to smoking\r\nthe whole process should be continuous, and delay should be avoided if the\r\nbest results are to be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEWER METHOD OF HANGING IN THE OPEN AIR.]\r\n\r\nSMOKING OF RUBBER.--The assumption may have been noted above that the sheet\r\nis to be smoked. As far as our knowledge extends, none but small native\r\nestates now prepare sheet rubber of any other type, with the exception of\r\ncertain patent processes. Air-dried sheets are generally made on\r\nsmall-holdings, and are bought in the market chiefly for the purpose of\r\nmacerating and making into blanket crepe. We have no intention, therefore,\r\nof discussing the possibilities or qualities of air-dried sheets, as the\r\noutput of sheet-rubber from our estates is always in smoked form. The\r\ndrying (or, properly, smoking) stage will be discussed in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_PREPARATION OF CREPE RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 1, OR FINE PALE CREPE.--Considering first the preparation of the\r\nhighest grade, fine pale crepe, it must be stated that the difficulties\r\nattached to the process are generally not sufficiently appreciated. In this\r\npale rubber minor blemishes are so plainly apparent that their importance\r\nis highly exaggerated, and what would worthily escape notice in smoked\r\nrubber assumes disproportionate prominence in pale crepes. The very fact\r\nthat such a delicate material as colourless coagulum has to be manipulated\r\nin coarse iron rollers, with the attendant oil and grease worries, should\r\nbe sufficient to deter one from criticising too harshly the occasional\r\nlapses of an estate struggling to give of its best to the market. At the\r\nsame time there can be no doubt that if precautions are taken to attend to\r\nall likely sources of contamination, defects in pale crepe may be avoided\r\nto a wonderful extent; and on some estates the observance of elementary\r\nrules enables the preparation of the finest pale crepe to be made almost\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nSTANDARDISATION OF LATEX.--The question of the standardisation of latex has\r\nbeen dealt with in a general way in Chapter VII., and the reader is now\r\nfamiliar with the trend of the argument in its favour. It will be\r\nrecognised that the necessity for standardisation exists to the same degree\r\nin the correct preparation of pale crepe as in the case of smoked sheet.\r\nUnless the dry rubber content is invariable, and the quantities of\r\nchemicals fixed, the colour of the crepe may vary appreciably.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that it is not _essential_ to adopt the same standard\r\nof dilution as for sheet preparation. Given that latices from all fields or\r\ndivisions are fairly uniform, and of high rubber content, the standard may\r\nbe taken at a figure equivalent, for example, to 2 lbs., or 2-1/2 lbs., or\r\neven 3 lbs. per gallon. It is wise, nevertheless, to take a lower standard\r\nfor several reasons. For instance:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The average dry rubber content varies with climatic conditions,\r\n     position of the cut on the tree, general health of the tree, etc. On a\r\n     rainy day the dry rubber content may be lowered too greatly by\r\n     adventitious circumstances.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Recording instruments often fail to give even approximately\r\n     correct readings in rich latex. Errors may thus be made easily.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) A fairly soft coagulum means easier working on the machines,\r\n     less labour, and proportionately cheaper costs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE GRADES OF CREPE RUBBER.\r\n\r\nLeft to right: fine pale crepe; second quality pale crepe; compound crepe.]\r\n\r\nIt is advised, therefore, that for general purposes the same standard as\r\nthat found suitable for sheet rubber should be taken--viz., 1-1/2 lbs. dry\r\nrubber per gallon. At all events the standard should not exceed 2 lbs. per\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\nCOAGULATION AND COAGULANT.--Coagulation may be undertaken without any\r\nspecial arrangement of tanks, and is usually effected in the ordinary\r\n\"Shanghai\" glazed earthenware jars containing about 45 gallons. Given\r\nreasonable care, and a fairly fool-proof system of calculation for the\r\nquantities of chemicals required, no difficulty need be experienced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WASHING SHED.\r\n\r\nSheets are soaked in hot water in tanks in the background, and then\r\nscrubbed under a spray of cold water.]\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale it is advised that proper reception tanks, in which\r\nstandardisation can be effected, should be installed. Where both sheet\r\nrubber and fine crepe are being prepared, the whole system of\r\nsheet-coagulating tanks may be employed with considerable advantage, even\r\nto the insertion of the partitions.\r\n\r\nIf ordinary jars are used, and the coagulum is left until the following\r\nmorning, the mass of rubber has to be cut up into pieces of a size suitable\r\nfor the machines. The knives or saws are sometimes rusty, and the colour of\r\nthe coagulum is affected. The coolies often feed into the machines lumps\r\nwhich are too large, with the result that portions are thrust under the\r\ncheek-blocks and become stained.\r\n\r\nWhen a sheet-coagulating tank is used all labour of cutting the coagulum is\r\nobviated. The long strips are handled and fed into the rolls easily. It may\r\nbe seen, likewise, that actual work is thus saved in machining.\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF COAGULANT.--For a general discussion on the coagulant and\r\nquantities employed, the reader is referred to Chapter VIII. It is there\r\nrecommended that for latex standardised to a level of 1-1/2 lbs. per\r\ngallon, the proportion of pure acetic acid should be in the ratio of\r\n1:1,200. Directions are there given for the making of the solution, and the\r\ncalculation of the quantity required for any given volume of latex.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out that for average _undiluted_ latex the basis of\r\ncalculation, for quantities of acetic acid required, should be taken on the\r\nratio 1:1,000. Where latex exceeds a dry rubber content of 3 lbs. per\r\ngallon, it may be necessary to increase the quantity of acid to 1:800.\r\n\r\nIf a standard of 2 lbs. per gallon is adopted, the formula given for the\r\n1-1/2 lbs. standard will not give full satisfaction, and the quantity of\r\nacid solution must be increased slightly in order to obtain complete\r\ncoagulation. Assuming that the original solution is prepared in 1 per cent.\r\nstrength, the following difference would be noted:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) One part pure acetic acid to 100 parts water (theoretically 99\r\n     parts).\r\n\r\n     (_b_)  _1-1/2 lbs. per gallon._    |      _2 lbs. per gallon._\r\n                                        |\r\n     Of the above solution use 1 gallon | Of the above solution use 1\r\n     to every 12 gallons of standardised| gallon to every 10 or 11\r\n     latex.                             | gallons of standardised latex.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to lay down an exact figure governing all cases, as so\r\nmuch depends upon the treatment undergone by the latex before it reaches\r\nthe store.\r\n\r\nSome estates continue to use solutions of greater strength, generally 5 per\r\ncent., in crepe preparation. While such solutions may be effectively\r\nstirred in when the latex is dilute, it is advised that for intimate\r\nmixture the solution need not be stronger than 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the quantities of acetic acid required much depends upon the\r\ninterval which is to elapse between the addition of acid and the time of\r\nworking of the coagulum. If the rubber is to remain until next morning, the\r\naverage formulae will be found suitable; but if it is required to work the\r\ncoagulum with an interval of less than three hours, an excess of acid must\r\nbe employed. The excess need be comparatively small, unless the interval is\r\nmuch reduced. For instance, it is the practice on some few estates to begin\r\nthe machining of the coagulum about half an hour after coagulation\r\ncommences; in which case it is usual to add from a quarter to a half of the\r\nnormal quantity in excess. It need scarcely be pointed out that unless this\r\nprocedure is strictly unavoidable it should be discouraged on account of\r\nthe waste of coagulant involved. Incidentally, the use of strong solutions\r\nof acid under such circumstances may lead to increased deterioration of the\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF FINE CREPE.--We are sometimes assured that manufacturers do not\r\npay the attention to the question of colour which sale conditions would\r\nlead one to believe. As far as we are concerned, and as long as there is no\r\ndirect traffic between producer and consumer, it must be recognised that in\r\nthe vast majority of cases we are forced to concern ourselves only with the\r\nstandards set up in the markets. This, in spite of the knowledge that, all\r\nother things being equal, the arbitrary distinctions in colour afford no\r\nindication of the intrinsic value of the rubber. Under present\r\ncircumstances it is plain that if paleness is demanded it has to be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nProbably without exception all estates employ sodium bisulphite as the\r\nagent for the prevention of that darkening (oxidation) which is natural in\r\ndrying rubber.\r\n\r\nSODIUM BISULPHITE.--A formula for use of this chemical is given in Chapter\r\nVIII., and is applicable to latex standardised to 1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per\r\ngallon. If a higher standard is chosen the quantity calculated as in (_b_)\r\nof that formula may be increased slightly, and the exact requirements found\r\nby experience. The caution must again be given that the employment of an\r\nexcess of sodium bisulphite will lead to the production of an over-pale\r\nrubber, and a prolongation of the drying period. If thick crepes are made,\r\nan excess of the chemical is sometimes made visible by a greyish powder\r\ndeposited on the edges of the strips of dry rubber.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised that the formula in Chapter VIII. indicates the\r\n_maximum_ quantities required for use with standard latex. Many estates\r\nwill find it expedient to use less of the chemical; and if it is found that\r\nthe desired result is not obtained from normal proportions, attention\r\nshould be directed to the points discussed in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nEVALUATION AND DETERIORATION OF SODIUM BISULPHITE AND SODIUM\r\nSULPHITE.--Sodium bisulphite and sodium sulphite are both bought for our\r\npurpose in the form of a fine crystalline powder, and on analysis good\r\nspecimens should contain over 90 per cent. pure substance, when packed in\r\nwell-sealed vessels.\r\n\r\nIt has often happened that shippers or local sellers, by inadvertence, have\r\nsupplied the one chemical in place of the other--to the detriment of the\r\nrubber and the discomfiture of managers of estates. The error, as a rule,\r\nhas not been detected for some time, and then perhaps only as a result of\r\ncomplaints or enquiries reaching the laboratories. To the layman, and\r\ncertainly to the native who usually has charge of these substances, it is\r\nnot a simple matter to distinguish between them without special knowledge.\r\nThere are certain elementary tests, however, which can be applied on all\r\nestates serving to make the distinction, but affording no information\r\nregarding the actual quality of the chemicals. They are given in a\r\ncomparative form on page 116. Samples of doubtful specimens may be sent to\r\nthe laboratories for analysis, but the bulk of the chemical should not be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nDuring the War some very poor shipments were received, and much trouble was\r\ncaused. Under normal conditions there can be no question that it is to the\r\ninterests of chemical manufacturers to supply the best article; and it is\r\nanticipated that in future there should be no difficulty in procuring\r\nshipments of a high degree of purity.\r\n\r\n      _Sodium Bisulphite._           |     _Sodium Sulphite._\r\n                                     |\r\n  1.

It is the potential presence of this gas which makes the\r\npowder effective as an anti-oxidant and disinfectant. It is within the\r\nexperience of all accustomed to the handling of this chemical, that in\r\naddition to the loss of gas, the powder cakes into a hard mass on exposure.\r\nIf only the top layer is caked, the remainder may be in fair condition; but\r\nno caked portions should be used, as they cannot be of good quality. They\r\nmay, however, be used for the treatment of scrap rubber, to be discussed\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nCARE OF SODIUM BISULPHITE.--The ready tendency of sodium bisulphite to\r\ndeteriorate on exposure should give sufficient indication regarding its\r\ntreatment in storage. It should be bought only in drums (or other air-tight\r\ncontainers), and should be stored in a dry place. No drum should be opened\r\nuntil required, and the common practice of keeping an open drum on the\r\nfloor of the factory should be avoided.\r\n\r\nDrums are of two sizes, generally containing 1/4 or 1/2 cwt. respectively.\r\nIt will be obvious that, although the prime cost may be cheaper with the\r\nlarger quantity, it would always be preferable to secure the smaller\r\ndrums, as the loss on exposure will be less.\r\n\r\nMost commonly the 56 lb. drum is purchased. It should not be difficult to\r\ncalculate the period during which the contents will be consumed, on the\r\nbasis of a maximum of 1 lb. per 100 gallons of latex. A 56 lb. drum,\r\nassuming no loss or waste, should be sufficient to treat _at least_ 5,600\r\ngallons of latex (say, 8,500 lbs. of rubber)--if the bisulphite is of\r\nfirst-class quality, and the use is applied only to the preparation of fine\r\npale crepe.\r\n\r\nWhere the quantity used per diem is small, it is advised that precautions\r\nshould be taken to preserve the quality of the chemical when a drum is\r\nopened. It might be of advantage to place the contents of the drum in\r\nsmaller sealed tins, or to have made a special container (with a closely\r\nfitting lid) into which the powder can be placed as soon as the drum has\r\nbeen opened.\r\n\r\nMIXING SOLUTION WITH LATEX.--Emphasis has been laid, in Chapter VIII., upon\r\nthe necessity for care in the preparation of the solution. Equal regard\r\nmust be given to the mixture of the solution with the latex.\r\n\r\nOn a few estates it used to be the practice to add the powder to the\r\nsolution of acid, with stirring. Obviously this led at least to a great\r\nloss of efficiency, owing to the rapid escape of the gas which was evolved.\r\n\r\nThe solution of sodium bisulphite should be poured into the latex in as\r\nuniform a distribution as possible. The mixture of solution and latex\r\nshould be thoroughly stirred, and if only natives are in charge a minimum\r\nperiod of five minutes should be prescribed before the addition of the\r\ncoagulant. A thorough stirring should again follow the advent of the acid.\r\n\r\nIf these elementary rules are not observed faithfully, the deficiency will\r\nmost probably be manifested in the dry rubber in the shape of streaks of\r\nvarying shades of colour.\r\n\r\nFinally it may be insisted upon that deteriorated sodium bisulphite should\r\nnot be used. In order to obtain an effect double the quantity may be\r\nrequired, and the residual salts left in the rubber on evaporation of the\r\nmoisture will be responsible for prolonged drying, surface deposits, and\r\npossibly \"spot disease.\"\r\n\r\nFORMER METHODS OF MAKING PALE RUBBER.--Merely as a matter of historic\r\ninterest it may be mentioned that previous to the introduction of sodium\r\nbisulphite pale crepes were made in comparatively small quantity by various\r\ndevices, among which the following might be quoted:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Use of excessive quantities of strong acetic acid.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Extreme dilution of latex in conjunction with excessive\r\n     quantities of acid.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Extreme dilution in conjunction with steaming and excess of\r\n     acid.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Extreme dilution of latex in conjunction with excess of acid and\r\n     subsequent heating of the coagulum in hot water.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) The use of excess of a mineral acid such as sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) The skimmings and very dilute latex, coagulated with excess of\r\n     acid.\r\n\r\nWORKING THE COAGULUM.--Description of the details of necessary machinery\r\nfor crepe-making is relegated to Section III. of this book. Here we shall\r\ntreat only of the matter in general.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of crepe rubber heavy machinery is necessary, and ample\r\nengine-power must be available. The machines should comprise three types:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) With rolls cut in such fashion, and run at such different\r\n     speeds, as to have a macerating effect upon the coagulum. Such\r\n     machines or rolls will be referred to as \"macerators.\"\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Intermediate rolls, grooved in varying designs and geared\r\n     differentially. These reduce the thick rough crepe obtained from the\r\n     macerators into a form suitable for passing to the rolls described in\r\n     (_c_). They are sometimes called \"crepers,\" but as this term may be\r\n     applied equally to the macerating rolls, they will be termed the\r\n     \"intermediate\" rolls.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Smooth rolls usually run at approximately even speeds and, as\r\n     their name denotes, devoid of any grooving. They are called \"smooth\"\r\n     rolls or \"finishers.\"\r\n\r\nWithout such equipment it is not possible to prepare the grade which is\r\nknown as \"fine pale crepe.\" In the common acceptation of this term crepe of\r\nNo. 1 quality generally connotes fineness and paleness with a thin crepe\r\nwhich has a good, smooth, and fairly well-knit texture.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, possible to make a thick pale crepe, using only the\r\nmacerators and intermediates, but the \"finish\" will be that typical of the\r\nparticular grooving of the intermediate rolls. For the preparation of crepe\r\nordinarily, the possession of smooth rolls is a _sine qua non_.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which will be explained more fully in the chapter dealing with\r\nthe defects of crepe rubber, the practice of preparing thick crepes direct\r\nfrom the coagulum is now very uncommon. Thick crepes are generally made by\r\nreworking dry rubber, either in the form of thin crepes or from air-dried\r\nsheets. The market for the latter in Malaya is confined almost entirely to\r\nSingapore, where factories buy native rubber and re-work it into thick\r\ncrepe.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the output of No. 1 crepe from estates is in the form of thin\r\n\"fine pale crepe.\" The artificial standard set up by buyers and brokers\r\nnecessitates this thin crepe being of even texture and fairly free from\r\nsmall holes (\"looseness\"). What difference the small holes are to make in\r\nthe vulcanising properties of the rubber is beyond our knowledge; but such\r\nbeing the standard, it must be attained if the full price is to be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the desired effect the coagulum must be passed\r\nconsecutively through the three types of rolls, and undergoes a varying\r\ndegree of working in each.\r\n\r\nGiven the necessary equipment of machines, it is possible to make a good\r\nspecimen of thin pale crepe if the coagulum passes through all the rolls a\r\ntotal of twelve times (or even less in exceptional cases). There is no\r\nintention of suggesting that this is possible on all estates. Clearly the\r\nnumber of times the rubber passes through the rolls will depend upon the\r\ntotal efficiency of the machines. This in turn involves such factors as\r\n(_a_) the size of the rolls, (_b_) the number of machines of each type,\r\n(_c_) the gearing of the pinions, (_d_) the speed of the drive, etc. Again,\r\nmuch depends upon the nature of the coagulum worked. A fairly soft coagulum\r\nwill offer less resistance, and conversely a dense coagulum will require\r\nmore machining.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by the writers in previous publications that over-working\r\nof the coagulum has an effect on the vulcanisation of the rubber; and this\r\nhas been confirmed by others.[10] Apart from this point, it should be\r\nrecognised that over-working, beyond that necessary to produce a thin crepe\r\nof even texture, is to be deprecated, on the ground of economy, in working.\r\n\r\n[10] Bulletin No. 27, Department of Agriculture F.M.S., April, 1918,\r\n\"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Para Rubber,\" Eaton, Grantham\r\nand Day.\r\n\r\nOwing to the existing differences in equipment and speed of drive, etc.,\r\nthe regular practice of any one estate may be unsuitable for another. It\r\nremains, therefore, a matter of study for each estate to discover the\r\nminimum number of times which rubber should pass through the machines,\r\nconsistent with the factors indicated above. In any case it may be assumed\r\nthat if any factory cannot prepare a good crepe by passing the rubber, say,\r\ntwelve times through the rolls, there is some deficiency in the machines,\r\nor of speed; the coagulum may be too hard, or the rolls may be badly worn.\r\n\r\nLOWER GRADES OF CREPE RUBBER.--Even a few years ago it was plain that the\r\nlower grades of crepe (_i.e._, all grades lower than first latex rubber)\r\nwere not sufficiently appreciated in the market. There was often a marked\r\ndifference in price between a first-grade crepe and crepe made from\r\nnaturally coagulated lump. This arose chiefly from lack of knowledge. It\r\nhas since been recognised in some measure that no reason exists for such a\r\nwide difference in price, and more recently the margin between even the\r\nfirst-grade rubber and the lowest grade of scrap rubber has been a\r\ngradually diminishing one. Providing sufficient care is exercised in the\r\npreparation of the lower grades, one would expect to see but very small\r\ndifference in prices between any two grades. It is true that adequate\r\nattention has been given to the preparation of the scrap grades only in\r\ncomparatively recent years, and it is acknowledged that when high prices\r\nwere ruling for first-grade rubbers sufficient attention was not generally\r\ngiven to the subject of the preparation of the lower grades.\r\n\r\nNATURALLY COAGULATED LUMP RUBBER.--The grade of rubber made from the\r\nnaturally coagulated lump which forms in buckets and carts is usually of a\r\nmixed colour, due to the fact that the lumps oxidise very quickly. When\r\nthey are allowed to remain overnight before being machined, it can be\r\nimagined that the colour of the dry crepe would be very dark, or would\r\ncontain very dark streaks. Such is ordinarily the case, unless special\r\nprecautions are taken.\r\n\r\nProviding that the coagulated lump is free from bark, leaves, and\r\nleaf-stems, and certain other precautions taken, the difference in price\r\nbetween coagulated-lump crepes and first-grade crepes should be very\r\nslight. Too often, however, not sufficient supervision is given to the\r\ncoagulated-lump rubber, and it is common to see it come into the factory\r\ncontaining leaves and bark. These should be picked out before the latex is\r\nstrained, but obviously it would be better to ensure that they did not\r\nenter the buckets in the first place.\r\n\r\nIt would seem reasonable to suppose that if some means could be employed\r\nfor preventing or checking the surface oxidation of naturally-coagulated\r\nlump rubber, there would be a corresponding improvement in the colour of\r\nthe dry crepe. That such a method is practicable has been demonstrated on\r\nmany estates. The lump when lifted out of the latex is allowed to drain for\r\na few minutes, and is then (without squeezing) placed in a dilute solution\r\nof sodium bisulphite. A 1 per cent. solution is sufficiently powerful. It\r\nis not to be thought for a moment that by the use of sodium bisulphite any\r\nprevious oxidation will be counteracted; all that is claimed for the\r\ntreatment is that any further surface oxidation will be checked, and the\r\nrubber may be allowed to remain until the next day, for working, if it is\r\nso desired. It will probably be found that quite a quantity of latex has\r\nbeen expressed from the lumps by contraction, and acid may be added to\r\nobtain the rubber from this. On other estates the lump rubber is worked on\r\nthe machines as it is received, and the resulting crepe is submerged in a\r\nweak solution of sodium bisulphite over-night. It is then rinsed in water\r\nand hung to drip before weighing and placing in the drying house. Under\r\ncertain conditions some of the lump rubber darkens rapidly during transport\r\nto the store, and any such oxidised portions must be rejected if a uniform\r\ncolour is to be expected in the crepe.\r\n\r\nFollowing the procedure indicated above, some estates find it possible to\r\nprepare from naturally coagulated lump rubber a crepe which can be classed\r\nas No. 1 grade.\r\n\r\nSKIMMINGS AND WASHINGS.--The skimmings of tanks, as already shown, may be\r\nprepared sometimes as a second quality of smoked sheet; but generally they\r\nare amalgamated with the rinsings of cups and buckets, treated with sodium\r\nbisulphite and acid, and made into crepe form.\r\n\r\nThe cup-washings, as they arrive at the store, represent a very dilute\r\nlatex, the rubber from which is generally of a greyish colour.\r\n\r\nBucket-washings should yield a good type of pale rubber if they are\r\nobtained properly. To obtain the maximum quantity of good rubber the\r\nbuckets should first be rinsed. A gang should be taken, a small quantity\r\n(say a quart) of water poured into the first bucket, and this dilute latex\r\nused progressively in all the buckets of that gang of tappers. The result\r\nis a fair latex which can be added to the bulk of No. 1 latex, provided it\r\nis free from dirt. Where sheet rubber is being prepared, carefully strained\r\ncup-washings or bucket-washings may be utilised in the dilution of the\r\nlatex to the required standard, thus increasing slightly the percentage of\r\nfirst-grade rubber.\r\n\r\nTREE-SCRAP.--As tree-scrap is a naturally coagulated rubber, it should be\r\nexpected to show up well in quality. This is usually the case; but from\r\nwhat has been said of the effect of sun-heat it will be understood that if\r\ntrees are not regularly \"scrapped,\" there is a danger that the crepes may\r\nbe found to contain tacky streaks due to the inclusion of old scrap which\r\nhas been sun-baked. In hot dry weather, on widely planted areas tapped on\r\nalternate days, it has been noticed that scrap remaining for two days often\r\nexhibits a resinous appearance, and feels sticky to the touch.\r\n\r\nIf tree-scrap is to be made as a separate grade, as used to be the general\r\ncustom, care should be taken to see that it is free from bark and dirt. On\r\nsome estates where scrap-rubber is paid for per pound collected, it is\r\nusually the rule to insist that scrap shall be washed free from dirt and\r\npicked free of bark. This course is to be commended, but might probably\r\nprove impracticable to the majority of estates. Theoretically, of course,\r\nthe operation of machining should rid the scrap of all traces of bark; but\r\nin practice it does not do so.\r\n\r\nSome proportion of the tree-scrap is usually found to be heavily oxidised,\r\nand naturally if a crepe of uniform colour is to be obtained these dark\r\nscraps must be rejected, otherwise dark streaks will be formed. Coolies\r\nshould be instructed to sort out the dark pieces before arriving at the\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nBARK-SHAVINGS.--It has been intimated in a previous section that the method\r\nof obtaining and collecting bark-shavings varies with the type of labour\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nWhere the scrap is removed from the edge of the bark on each occasion\r\nbefore tapping, the amount of rubber to be extracted from the dry shavings\r\nis very small--so small, in fact, that when the price of rubber is low, it\r\nis doubtful whether it pays to collect and work the material.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where trees are not \"scrapped\" before tapping, the\r\nbark-shavings and tree-scrap are collected together, and the amount of\r\nrubber derived from the mixture may be 30 to 40 per cent. upon the gross\r\nweight--depending chiefly upon the quality of the tapping (_i.e._, in this\r\ncase, the thickness of the paring). Another factor influencing this figure\r\nwould be the effect of using an anti-coagulant on the cuts.\r\n\r\nBark-shavings entail such wear upon the ordinary machines during working,\r\nespecially if fairly free from rubber, that unless the factory is equipped\r\nwith a special \"scrap-washer\" it is advised that this material should be\r\nsent for working to a factory having the necessary equipment. Whenever\r\npossible, bark-shavings should receive treatment on the day of collection.\r\n\r\nIt used to be quite common to see heaps of bark-shavings accumulating on\r\nthe floor of a factory, and generating excessive heat. Yet these heaps were\r\nallowed to stand about for a day or days. Is it any wonder then that\r\ntackiness was found to develop when the rubber was dry? It is here\r\ndefinitely laid down that no heaps of bark-shavings should be accumulated\r\neven for half a day. Tanks should be provided in which the shavings should\r\nbe submerged in water.\r\n\r\nEARTH-SCRAP.--Of all grades of crepe this is the one most liable to become\r\ntacky in transit. This tackiness to a large extent cannot be avoided, as\r\nold pieces of earth-scrap may be brought in amongst the bulk. Probably\r\nthese old pieces have been exposed to the sun for days, and have become\r\nquite resinous. It would be practically impossible to go through all\r\nearth-scrap in order to find these odd pieces, but unless this were done\r\none could not guarantee that the earth-rubber would always be free from\r\ntackiness. The difficulty does not appear, however, on estates where\r\nearth-rubber is collected systematically at very frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nFIBROUS MATTER IN LOW-GRADE RUBBERS.--It is sometimes found in this and\r\nother lower grade rubbers that pieces of cloth or cotton-waste are\r\nconcealed. Coolies may have used them for cleaning cups, or the store\r\ncoolies may have been at fault. Earth-scraps especially should be examined,\r\nbefore working, for such extraneous matter.\r\n\r\nSCRAP-WASHERS.--These are heavy machines specially devised for the\r\ntreatment of lower grade rubbers. In these the raw rubber is well\r\nmasticated and freed from impurities, if the machine functions efficiently.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of these machines, all of which are efficient. That\r\nbest known is the \"Universal\" washer, made by Joseph Baker, Sons, and\r\nPerkins, Ltd. (formerly Perkins Engineering Company). Coming into local\r\nfavour during the War, the \"U.E.\" scrap-washer, made by the United\r\nEngineering Company (Singapore), gives very good service. The \"C.C.C.\"\r\nwasher, made by the Colombo Commercial Company, is suitable for the\r\npurposes of an average estate. There are others, less well known. Most of\r\nthese machines are made in varying sizes to meet the requirements of small,\r\nmedium, or large estates; and if funds are available, a scrap-washer should\r\nbe regarded as an essential item in the machinery of any estate employing\r\nengine power.\r\n\r\nThe rate of output of scrap-washers will depend mainly upon the speed at\r\nwhich they are driven, and when ordering the equipment it would be\r\nadvisable to state the ordinary speed of the back-shaft, length of drive,\r\netc. It does not follow that the larger the rate of output, the greater is\r\nthe efficiency of the washer. The point is not as to what quantity of\r\nrubber can be taken out per hour, but what quantity is actually freed from\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable for the superintendent to obtain a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe general construction and principles of the particular scrap-washer\r\nemployed. In the past it was not uncommon to find superintendents innocent\r\nof the fact that a certain type of washer possessed movable parts upon\r\nwhich the efficiency of the cleansing largely depended. It was often found\r\nthat these parts, which were intended to be removed and cleaned at\r\nintervals, had become firmly fixed and could not be removed for inspection.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognised also that the machines are liable to considerable\r\ndamage if extraneous substances are allowed to enter--for example,\r\ntapping-knives, stones, pieces of iron, spouts, etc., which are sometimes\r\npresent in the loose scraps of rubber or shavings, owing to the\r\ncarelessness of coolies. Under the best regulated-system, such accidents\r\noccasionally occur, but a great deal of trouble could be avoided by having\r\nit understood that each charge must be sorted over before entering the\r\nwasher.\r\n\r\nAgain a deal of extra work, and much wear and tear, is caused by the\r\n_abuse_ of the scrap-washer--_e.g._, in the cleansing of earth-scrap. As\r\nthis reaches the factory it often contains a quantity of internal or\r\nadhering earth. Before entering the washer a good proportion of the\r\nexternal soil could be removed if the scraps were thrown into a tank and\r\ngiven a thorough soaking and stirring. In a similar manner dry\r\nbark-shavings, which have been allowed to accumulate, could be softened.\r\n\r\nIn the actual working of scrap-washers instructions are generally given by\r\nthe makers. These sometimes advise the introduction of warm water (or of\r\nsteam into the cold water supply) for an interval during the working of\r\neach charge. Where possible, such instructions should be followed, as by\r\nthis means the individual pieces of rubber are massed together, in the\r\nfinal stage, into a \"sausage\" form which is easy to transport and to\r\nmanipulate in the ordinary crepeing battery.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND CREPES.--The attitude of both buyers and sellers with regard to\r\nthe types of lower grade rubbers appears to be changing. In the past, from\r\nany one estate there might be obtained as many as six grades of crepe below\r\nNo. I. These comprised:\r\n\r\n     (1) A pale rubber (often streaked) obtained from coagulation of cup\r\n     washings and bucket rinsings.\r\n\r\n     (2) A pale rubber (often streaked) obtained by coagulation of the\r\n     skimmings from the surface of the No. 1 latex.\r\n\r\n     (3) A streaked and dull rubber prepared from naturally-coagulated\r\n     clots found in cups, buckets, and latex carts.\r\n\r\n     (4) A streaked rubber prepared from scrap which had coagulated upon\r\n     the face of the cut bark.\r\n\r\n     (5) A brownish and streaked rubber made by maceration of bark-shavings\r\n     to which pieces of tree-scrap adhered.\r\n\r\n     (6) A dark rubber, often tacky, prepared from scrap found in or on the\r\n     ground near the base of the trees. As it is often a matter of weeks\r\n     between any two regular collections, it is easy to understand why the\r\n     dry rubber was more liable to be \"tacky\" than any other grade of\r\n     crepe.\r\n\r\nIt will have been evident to all who have acquaintance with these grades,\r\nas shipped from many different estates, that the diversity in the various\r\nshipments must have been rather bewildering. There appeared to be a\r\nregrettable lack of uniformity, even in the appearance of, say, a bark\r\nscrap rubber from any two estates. When, in addition to these variations,\r\nthe further complication of condition of cleanliness is introduced, one may\r\nrealise the difficulty attaching to the evaluation of these rubbers as they\r\nappeared upon the market.\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing paragraph is written in the past tense, it should be\r\npointed out that within certain limits the trouble continues to exist with\r\nrespect to the output of a great number of estates.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many, it has been realised that the manufacturer does not\r\nwant to buy a large number of \"parcels,\" all differing in some respect. It\r\nis probably correct to state that what a manufacturer requires is a big\r\n\"parcel\" uniform in appearance and treatment, even though the colour may\r\nnot be so light as that of many smaller lots. This statement is modified\r\nwith the proviso that the rubber, no matter what its colour or appearance\r\nmay be, must be free from dirt, grit, and bark.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of making a uniform product from several types of lower\r\ngrade rubbers has been successfully solved on several estates by the\r\npreparation of a \"compound\" crepe composed of a mixture of the best lower\r\ngrades in approximately definite proportions daily. Naturally the shade of\r\ncolour of this compound crepe will depend largely upon the types of rubber\r\nemployed, but as a rule it is somewhat darker than the highest of the types\r\nemployed in the mixture. To the writers this seems immaterial as long as\r\nthe manufacturer is offered a larger and more uniform lot which can be\r\ngiven uniform treatment in vulcanisation processes. Neither would it appear\r\nthat the seller suffers any monetary loss. In point of fact it will be\r\nfound probably that the reverse is the case. For instance, supposing it\r\nwere decided to mix for a compound crepe--\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Naturally coagulated lump rubber.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Tree-scrap.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Bark-shavings scrap.\r\n\r\nThe product would be darker in colour than (_a_) and slightly better than\r\n(_b_). Let it be granted that there might be a monetary loss on (_a_), it\r\nis probable that there would be a slight gain in comparison with the usual\r\nprices obtained for (_b_) and (_c_). Now, as a general rule, the actual\r\npercentage of crop made into (_b_) is appreciably less than that made into\r\n(_c_) and still less than (_b_) and (_c_) together. Apparently, therefore,\r\nthere would be a margin of profit on the whole by making a compound crepe.\r\nIt may be pointed out, on the other hand, that there might be expended on\r\nthe manufacture of this crepe more time and labour, but as against this the\r\nlabour of sorting and grading would be simplified.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this process is not open to estates which do not possess a\r\nscrap-washer. _It is essential that the rubber should be free from grit,\r\nsand, and bark particles._ In the absence of a scrap-washer for the\r\ncleansing of the bark-shavings, it would be futile to attempt to make a\r\ncompound crepe containing that type of rubber, as one would run the risk of\r\nspoiling the whole. It seems certain that in course of time a scrap-washer\r\nwill be considered as necessary a piece of machinery as an ordinary\r\ncrepeing machine in the factories of estates having sufficient means. Until\r\nthat time the preparation of compound crepes must be the privilege only of\r\nwell-equipped estates, unless other estates can send their lower grade\r\nrubbers for treatment in a scrap-washer to their more fortunate neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn previous publications a diminution in the number of grades of crepe\r\nrubber has been advocated, and it is gratifying to find that in many cases\r\nthe amending grades suggested have been improved upon. Many estates now\r\nmake only three grades of crepe--viz.:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) No. 1. From latex coagulated in the store.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) No. 2. Compound.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) No. 3. Earth-rubber.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the compound crepe includes all types between fine\r\npale crepe and earth-rubber. Naturally one could not safely recommend the\r\ninclusion of earth-rubber in any compound crepe, as the risk of possible\r\n\"tackiness\" in the whole would be serious. In the case of the bark-shavings\r\nrubber to be incorporated, it is first cleaned alone in the scrap-washer.\r\nThen all types are mixed together again in the scrap-washer in proportions\r\nruled by the experience of the usual average percentages of each grade of\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nBesides the estates having only three grades, there are others which make\r\nfour--viz.:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) No. 1. From latex coagulated in the store.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) No. 2. Compound, from cup washings, etc., skimmings, and\r\n     naturally coagulated lump.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) No. 3. Compound, from tree-scrap and bark-shavings rubber.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) No. 4. Earth-scrap.\r\n\r\n     Other variations are possible, but their number is limited, and they\r\n     all conduce to simplification of working, and a supply to the market\r\n     of rubber having greater uniformity.\r\n\r\nNEED FOR INCREASED CARE WITH LOWER GRADE RUBBER.--In the ordinary procedure\r\nof estate-working there appears to be an undesirable variety in the style\r\nof lower grade crepes. On some estates an examination of these rubbers\r\nwould appear to suggest that there need be no expenditure of care in the\r\npreparation or the form in which it is made. This is a great mistake. With\r\nthe exception of the lowest grade (earth-rubber), it would not be unfair to\r\nstate that the quality of the rubbers on testing should be very little\r\ninferior to the No. 1 product. Often, as in the case of naturally\r\ncoagulated rubbers, they are superior in some respects to ordinary fine\r\npale crepe. Doubtless manufacturers are aware of these facts, but what\r\ncourse is open to them if they find the rubber spoiled for their purpose by\r\nthe presence of particles of sand, grit, or bark? The possible injury\r\ncaused by these ingredients cannot be insisted upon too strongly, and it\r\nmust be evident that great care should be exercised in the preparation of\r\nthe lower grades of crepe.\r\n\r\nAs to the particular form of the lower grade crepe rubber, one may apply\r\nthe remarks made under the section dealing with the best grades. It is\r\ncommon to find thin crepes, medium crepes, and \"blanket\" crepes. More often\r\nthan otherwise, the medium and thicker crepes are prepared direct in those\r\nforms. It follows that they are liable to attacks of \"spot\" disease, which,\r\nhowever, is not easily visible in the lowest grades, owing to the dark\r\ncolour of the rubber. Furthermore, it is not possible to cleanse the rubber\r\nso thoroughly if thick crepes are made.\r\n\r\nBLOCK RUBBER.--Few estates now prepare block rubber, which is essentially\r\ncrepe rubber pressed into blocks. In the ordinary process the fresh\r\ncoagulum is lightly rolled into thin crepe, which is then vacuum-dried.\r\nThere are slight variations in the subsequent procedure. Sometimes the\r\nrubber as it comes from the vacuum drier is merely allowed to remain on\r\nracks overnight before blocking. In other instances, the sticky rubber from\r\nthe vacuum drier is passed once or twice through wet, smooth rolls and hung\r\nto dry for some days. The dry crepe is then folded into the pressing box or\r\ncut to suit the size of the box. Pressure is applied for some time, and\r\nfinally the rubber is taken out in one homogeneous mass. Naturally the\r\nappearance of the block depends upon the quality of the parent crepe. Some\r\nblock rubber is made up thick; other is made in slabs about 3 inches or 4\r\ninches in thickness. With the latter, it should be possible, when held up\r\nto the light, to see the shape of a hand held between it and the source of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an erroneous idea of the strength of block rubber has\r\nbeen formed. It should only be necessary to point out that essentially\r\nblock rubber is merely pressed crepe rubber. It is inconceivable that the\r\nmere action of pressing layers of crepe together would increase the\r\nphysical quality of the rubber.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which block rubber possesses are the compactness of the\r\noutput, its ease of packing, and a saving in freight; but there is the\r\ndisadvantage, from the consumer's point of view, that extra labour is\r\ninvolved in the preparatory work of cutting up the blocks.\r\n\r\nSMOKED CREPE AND SHEET CLIPPINGS.--There appears to be no certain demand\r\nfor any grade of smoked crepe, and probably all which is put into the\r\nmarket is really comprised of (1) clippings obtained from the ends of\r\nsheets, (2) sheets which have been malformed in machining, or (3) sheets\r\nshowing the presence of many \"bubbles.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the first class it might be explained that through defective rolling,\r\nthick ends or edges may be caused. These show signs of contained moisture\r\nwhen the bulk of the sheet is perfectly dry, and as undue delay would\r\notherwise result these moist strips are trimmed and either returned to the\r\nsmoke-house, or machined to form crepe.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a torn or otherwise badly formed sheet, when brought from the\r\nsmoke-house, may be made into crepe, rather than it should prejudice the\r\nselling price of the bulk under ruling conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, although \"bubbles\" have no influence upon the quality\r\nof the rubber on vulcanisation, sheets thus affected are generally made\r\ninto crepe.\r\n\r\nIt cannot possibly be argued that rubber of this description would be in\r\nany way inferior to the best smoked sheet for manufacturing purposes, but\r\nowing to the prevailing system of evaluation for market purposes, it is\r\nnecessary to resort to the expedients indicated above.\r\n\r\nOn some estates the rubber specified in the three classes mentioned is not\r\nmade into crepe, but cut up into small pieces and shipped as \"sheet\r\nclippings\" or \"sheet trimmings\"--a procedure which would appear to be\r\njustified by a steady demand. In point of fact, the buyers are really\r\nobtaining a first-class article (except in superficial appearance) at a\r\nreduced price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_DRYING OF RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR-DRYING OF CREPE.--It is still the prevailing custom to air-dry crepe\r\nrubbers. A few estates, it is true, have artificial driers installed, and\r\nin some necessary cases others will be erected. But in the majority of\r\ncases where money has been expended in building air-drying sheds, as long\r\nas it is only possible to ship rubber regularly air-drying is likely to\r\nremain in favour.\r\n\r\nThe great drawback to air-drying is that one is so dependent upon the\r\nweather conditions. In favourable weather the rubber dries well, but in a\r\nlong period of wet weather rubber may accumulate at an alarming rate, and\r\nthe accommodation is sometimes severely taxed. Of course, the rate of\r\ndrying under the best conditions is mainly dependent on the thickness of\r\nthe crepe, and every endeavour should be made to maintain a thin style of\r\npreparation. If this precaution is not taken, the rubber is liable to\r\nrecurrent attacks of \"spot\" disease, and one's troubles are very much\r\naugmented. This is a disability to which rubber treated in artificial\r\ndriers is not liable. Still, air-dried rubber can be made equal, if not\r\nsuperior, in appearance to pale rubbers prepared by other processes.\r\n\r\nFor the lowest grades of crepe air-drying is always likely to remain the\r\nonly method, as it would be extremely unsafe to submit them to heat.\r\n\r\nIt is noted in ordinary practice that the rate of drying on different\r\nestates, for the same type of rubber, may vary widely. Naturally the\r\nconstruction of the house has a great effect, and this subject will receive\r\nattention in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the position of the drying-shed exerts an important influence,\r\nand the erection of the building in low-lying surroundings is always\r\ncalculated to prolong the drying period appreciably. Incidentally this\r\nmeans that the building must be larger than a normal rate of drying would\r\notherwise demand.\r\n\r\nThe combination of a poor type of drying-house, a low-lying situation, and\r\na prolonged wet season, might render it advisable to abandon the air-drying\r\nof high grade crepes in favour of artificial drying.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL DRIERS FOR CREPE.--It is more common to find artificial driers\r\nin use in Ceylon than in Malaya, possibly because these driers have been in\r\nuse in Ceylon for other products. Some time ago the question of installing\r\nartificial driers received the serious attention of a number of estates in\r\nthis country, chiefly on account of the incidence of fungoid and bacterial\r\ndiseases in crepe rubber. The simple treatment for the prevention of these\r\ndiseases is to get the rubber dry in the shortest possible space of time.\r\nIn most cases it is found sufficient to roll crepe thin for air-drying in\r\norder to prevent the appearance of coloured spots. It is found, however,\r\nthat some drying-houses are so badly planned and constructed, that quick\r\ndrying under even the best of conditions is a practical impossibility.\r\nCases have been known in which the disease may disappear almost entirely\r\nduring a period of freedom from rain, only to recur as soon as wet weather\r\nsets in again. There can be no doubt that, on the whole, the number of\r\ncases of \"spot\" disease is on the decline; but equally it is certain that a\r\nvery few estates will always be liable to outbreaks as long as drying is\r\nattempted in existing houses. For these reasons it is a poor policy to\r\ntemporise, and the only sound policy in extreme cases would be to give up\r\nordinary air-drying in favour of some method of artificial drying. As\r\nregards the majority of estates preparing pale crepe for various reasons,\r\nit is not expected that any will instal artificial driers. Money has been\r\nexpended in elaborate buildings which certainly do the work for which they\r\nwere designed. As long, therefore, as the accommodation is sufficient, and\r\nregular shipments are the rule, it is expected that ordinary air-drying\r\nwill still remain the general practice.\r\n\r\nOf the better-known artificial driers, there are only three which merit\r\nserious consideration in these pages. They are the vacuum driers, the\r\nColombo Commercial Company's hot-air drier, and the Michie-Golledge\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nVACUUM DRIERS.--The vacuum drier is so well known that only a brief\r\ndescription need be given. It consists of a chamber heated by steam pipes\r\nand capable of having the contained air and moisture withdrawn by a pump.\r\nThis description sounds very simple, and in practice the operation of\r\nvacuum drying is really a simple one, and can well be entrusted to an\r\nintelligent coolie under efficient supervision. Indicators are fitted which\r\nshow the vacuum pressure and the pressure of steam in the heating pipes\r\nwhich travel underneath horizontal slabs upon which trays may be placed.\r\nStill, in spite of the apparent simplicity of the process, there would\r\nappear to be a number of little details which, if overlooked, prove to be\r\nfactors influencing the result to a considerable degree. Thus it is not\r\nuncommon to find complaints that the rubber is not dry when packed. The\r\nwriters have seen rubber taken from a vacuum drier still containing a\r\nvisible quantity of moisture. One would have imagined that continuous\r\nworking of the drier would give the experience necessary to obtain dry\r\nrubber, but, apparently, such is not the case in a number of instances.\r\nElaborate instructions are given by the makers, but often they are more\r\nhonoured in the breach than in the observance. Really, there are only two\r\npoints to bear in mind:\r\n\r\n     (1) That the rubber must be fairly thin.\r\n\r\n     (2) That the temperature be not allowed to rise too high. Some makers\r\n     advise 140 deg. F. as a maximum, but no harm results from a temperature of\r\n     150 deg. to 160 deg. as long as the interval is not prolonged.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] These figures refer to temperatures recorded by thermometers placed in\r\nthe folds of the rubber.\r\n\r\nThese two points presume that the vacuum drier is true to its name, and\r\nthat one can obtain a maximum steady pressure. The machines are so well\r\nmade now that no drier should be taken over from those responsible for its\r\nerection unless it can show a vacuum pressure of 28 inches within fifteen\r\nminutes of starting the pump; and with the pump stopped, there should not\r\nbe a greater fall in pressure than 1 inch within ten minutes after stopping\r\nthe pump.\r\n\r\nOne of the most frequent sources of error is the control of steam pressure\r\nwhich is responsible for the temperature of the drier. It is quite\r\nunnecessary and unwise to maintain any steam pressure once the drying is\r\nwell under way. All that is necessary is to heat the chamber well, with a\r\nsteam pressure of 5 lbs., before inserting the rubber. As soon as the\r\nmaximum vacuum pressure has been obtained, steam should be shut off from\r\nthe heating pipes, and it will be found that the temperature is well\r\nmaintained throughout the operation with a rise of ten to twenty degrees at\r\nthe end. If the drier is working at a vacuum pressure of 28 inches, and if\r\nthe crepe has been prepared thin enough, the rubber should be quite dry\r\nwithin two hours. Should the operation have to be extended to two and a\r\nhalf hours at 28 inches vacuum pressure, it is a sign that the crepe is too\r\nthick. On such occasions it is often noticed that these thicker crepes are\r\nnot thoroughly dry, having moist spots enclosed in them. On re-rolling,\r\nthese moist patches become easily visible, and are a source of great\r\nannoyance, inasmuch as they take quite a long time to dry out.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the crepe for vacuum drying should be thin. There is\r\nno necessity to give it a superfine finish, and the presence of small holes\r\nis quite permissible, as they disappear on subsequent re-rolling. The thin\r\ncrepe may be folded loosely to the length (or breadth) of the tray several\r\ntimes, but in no other way can the drier be expected to perform its work\r\nsatisfactorily. A case was noted in which thin crepe was excellently\r\nprepared, and four or five layers were rolled together for vacuum drying.\r\nNaturally this mode of procedure does not give the drier a fair chance, and\r\nit would be ridiculous to judge vacuum drying on the results. After two and\r\na half hours at a temperature of 145 deg. F. the rubber appeared to be only\r\nabout three parts dry, and the subsequent air-drying extended well into a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nIt is the common practice to screw up the door of the chamber as tightly as\r\npossible. As a rule it is found in course of time that the obtainable\r\nmaximum vacuum pressure decreases. This may be attributed solely to the\r\nforcible screwing up of the door. Around the inside edges of the door are\r\nstrips of rubber compound, the function of which is to form a tight joint.\r\nShould the door be screwed up too tightly, these strips become deformed in\r\ncourse of time, and slight leaks occur. It should be pointed out that it is\r\nonly necessary to screw up the door at the beginning of the operation. When\r\nthe vacuum has been obtained, the screw pressure may be released, as the\r\natmospheric pressure outside the chamber is more than ample to keep the\r\ndoor in a close fitting position. This will be obvious from the fact that\r\nthe difference in pressure between the inside and the outside of the door\r\namounts to, say, 28 inches atmospheric pressure--_i.e._, nearly 14 lbs. per\r\nsquare foot. By slackening the screw handles, therefore, as soon as the\r\nindicator shows the maximum working vacuum pressure, the life of the door\r\njoints may be prolonged, and the drier will remain efficient for a longer\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the question of temperature leads one to the\r\nconclusion that the practice of placing a thermometer through the roof of\r\nthe chamber does not enable one to determine the temperature correctly. In\r\nthe same way a thermometer suspended behind the observation window cannot\r\nindicate the temperature of the rubber, as in both of these positions the\r\nthermometer must be influenced by radiation from the walls of the chamber.\r\nThe only position in which the correct temperature could be indicated is\r\nbetween the folds of crepe. This can be arranged easily so as to enable one\r\nto read the temperature from the observation window.\r\n\r\nCOLOMBO COMMERCIAL COMPANY'S DRIER.--The drier of the Colombo Commercial\r\nCompany consists in principle of a number of small chambers or units in\r\nwhich crepe rubber is placed, and through which hot air is passed. As in\r\nthe case of vacuum drying, a great deal depends upon the preliminary\r\ntreatment of the rubber. If the crepe is not rolled thin enough drying will\r\nbe unduly prolonged, with a possibility that the rubber will become tacky.\r\nThe temperature usually obtained is about 150 deg. F., and if the rubber is\r\nthin the production of an installation of two chambers should be at the\r\nrate of 1 lb. of dry rubber per minute. The usual period of drying is\r\nunder two hours. One advantage which this drier has over the vacuum drier\r\nis that the chamber can be opened at any time for a short period to\r\nwithdraw or insert trays. The thin crepe is folded several times, as in the\r\ncase of vacuum-drying.\r\n\r\nFigures obtained from the actual working of a drier in Ceylon are given\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n         CHAMBER 1.--TEMPERATURE 160 deg.-180 deg.F.       |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------|CHAMBER 2.--TEMPERATURE\r\n  _NO.

This stickiness is only temporary, and is got rid of by\r\npassing the crepe through wet rolls. Opinions differ as to when this\r\nrolling should be given. On some estates the rubber is only allowed to cool\r\na little before passing through the rolls; on others it is given a day or\r\nso before rolling. The methods of rolling also differ. In some factories\r\nthe rubber has been cut to lengths before drying, and these lengths are\r\nmerely rolled together by simple pressure. Other estates prefer to\r\nre-macerate the crepe while still fairly warm and soft. It is probable that\r\nlittle harm, if any, results from this re-maceration while the rubber is\r\nsoft, as it is more easily worked in this condition. The thick rubber is\r\nthen generally hung for a few days to air-dry before packing. As most of\r\nthe moisture taken up by the dry rubber is surface moisture, three or four\r\ndays is usually found ample for air-drying.\r\n\r\nMICHIE-GOLLEDGE SYSTEM.--The Michie-Golledge system comprises a process of\r\npreparation and drying. The latex is diluted with two, three, or four\r\nvolumes of water and coagulated with acid in a vessel which is rotated with\r\na churning motion. In this cylinder there are curved and fixed blades. The\r\nrevolving cylinder and its ribs force the latex against the curved blades\r\nso as to cause an eddy in the middle of the machine. Here the rubber\r\ncoagulates and accumulates, the remaining liquor whirling round outside the\r\nblades. It can be imagined that with such dilute latex, the coagulum is\r\nvery soft and spongy. This soft mass is passed through a machine which cuts\r\nit into \"worms\" about 3/16 inch in section. These are placed upon wire\r\ntrays and dried by means of hot air. The \"worms\" when dry are re-macerated\r\nand built up into medium and thick crepes. The colour of the rubber\r\nprepared by this process is usually very good. When treated in a Colombo\r\ndrier the \"worms\" usually require about two hours to dry, so that crepe\r\nrubber may be packed at latest on the fourth or fifth day, as in the case\r\nof vacuum-dried rubber.\r\n\r\nRATE OF AIR-DRYING OF CREPE RUBBER.--In spite of the facts that some\r\nestates have been making thin pale crepes for years, and that so much has\r\nbeen written concerning the preparation of this grade of rubber, one\r\noccasionally meets with a case in which an estate seems to be unable to\r\nprepare thin pale crepe, or if it does the period of drying is much longer\r\nthan obtains on most estates.\r\n\r\nAgain, when cases of infection by spot disease in fairly thin crepes are\r\nsubmitted, it is usually found that the particular crepes are of that type\r\nwhich, though fairly thin, show whitish spots of moisture when the bulk of\r\nthe rubber is nearly dry. This type of crepe is to be noted for the\r\nexcessive period of drying in comparison with other crepes of equal\r\nthinness. It has been advanced elsewhere[12] that a factor of the most\r\nconsiderable importance in the rate of drying of crepe rubber is the type\r\nof drying-house and its situation. This accounts very largely for observed\r\ndifferences in the rate of drying of thin crepes on different estates. Yet\r\neven where two drying-houses may be of the same type, and the situations\r\nmay be comparable, one still observes that one thin crepe dries more\r\nquickly than another. It has been remarked also that a thin crepe in one\r\nold drying-house dries in a shorter period than a similar crepe in another\r\nmore modern house, although the methods of coagulation and preparation\r\nexhibit no apparent diversity. In all these conflicting cases allowance is\r\nmade for the weather conditions, and the observed differences seem to be\r\ninexplicable. It has always been the opinion of the writers that the actual\r\nrolling of the rubber plays an important part in determining the rate of\r\ndrying of crepe, apart from the question of thinness; and it seemed\r\npossible that this factor would account for the discrepancies noted above,\r\neither partially or wholly.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" Morgan, 1913, chapters xii. and\r\nxiii.\r\n\r\nWith a view to determining to what degree the drying of crepe rubber was\r\nhastened by the extent to which the rubber was rolled, experiments were\r\nmade. It was hoped, also, that some idea would be gained of the particular\r\nstage in crepe rolling which had the greatest effect upon the rate of\r\ndrying. In preparing crepe in the estate in the ordinary way the coagulum\r\nis passed through three sets of rollers, and the stages may be described\r\nas:\r\n\r\n     (1) Rough rolling.\r\n\r\n     (2) Medium rolling.\r\n\r\n     (3) Smooth rolling.\r\n\r\nIn the first the coagulum is broken down by passing through the machines\r\nuntil a thick rough crepe is formed. This passes to the intermediate\r\nrollers, where it is worked down to a medium crepe. The rubber finally goes\r\nto the smooth running at approximately even speeds. Passing through these a\r\nnumber of times it emerges as a thin uniform crepe, free from \"lumpiness\"\r\nand free from holes, which should dry in from ten to twelve days.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment the rubber was passed through the machines with varying\r\nfrequency, the number of times in each machine being progressively\r\nincreased, while the working on the other machines remained constant.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that the rate of drying was affected only by the extent\r\nto which the crepe was worked in the smooth rolls. The less often the\r\nrubber passed through these rolls, the slower the rate of drying. Beyond a\r\nlimit in the other direction, increased rolling did not reduce the period\r\nof drying. It follows, therefore, that crepes which have a good thin finish\r\nshould dry in a minimum period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING GRAPH. PALE CREPE (THIN).]\r\n\r\nWHEN DOES AIR-DRYING TAKE PLACE?--Experiments[13] were conducted with a\r\nview to discovering, if possible, the rate at which crepe rubber dries, and\r\nthe extent of drying during the night under weather conditions such as\r\nprevail ordinarily in Malaya. It is to be remembered that, during the day,\r\nmost drying-houses are fairly open and that the temperature ranges from\r\nabout 88 deg. F. in the lower rooms to over 100 deg. in the upper rooms (near the\r\nroof) when the sun shines. At night, however, there is usually a decided\r\ndrop in the temperature, and unless it is a very clear night the air is\r\ngenerally saturated with moisture. In addition the drying-house is closed\r\nas thoroughly as possible, and we should expect the atmosphere of the house\r\nto be laden with moisture from the wet and drying rubber. It would be a\r\njust inference, therefore, that the rate of drying during the night would\r\nbe much less than the rate of drying during the day, and the results of\r\nexperiments confirm this very fully. One was hardly prepared, however, to\r\nfind that, under certain circumstances and at a certain stage, the amount\r\nof drying is nil; not only so, but it was found under certain conditions\r\nthat the amount of drying which took place was negative--_i.e._, the rubber\r\nweighed slightly more when taken out in the morning than it had weighed the\r\nprevious afternoon.\r\n\r\n[13] Rubber Growers' Association, Malaya Local Report, No. 2, 1914.\r\n\r\nCREPE MAY INCREASE IN WEIGHT.--As an instance of the kind of result\r\nobtained a graph is here given of the rate of drying of a batch of pale\r\ncrepe. This was hung to dry in the top room of a drying-house in which\r\nrubber ordinarily dries quickly. The rubber was hung in a good position,\r\nwith the bulk of output, near a window which was open for some time during\r\nthe day. In order to restrict the day interval of drying to the actual\r\nperiod in which the sun was likely to be in evidence, the day was taken to\r\nbegin at 8 a.m. and end at 4 p.m., the night interval covering the\r\nremaining sixteen hours. Thus the night interval was twice as long as the\r\nperiod of day drying. The lengths of crepe were weighed carefully at 8 a.m.\r\nand 4 a.m., and the average of the several weights was plotted in a graph.\r\n\r\nThe weights are placed vertically and the duration of drying horizontally.\r\nIt will be seen that the rubber was quite dry and fit for packing on the\r\nsixth day, as far as could be judged in the usual way by casual inspection.\r\nPeculiarly enough at this time it weighed slightly more than had been\r\nregistered on the fourth and fifth days, but the difference did not amount\r\nto more than about 0.4 per cent. In examining the graph it should be borne\r\nin mind that the steeper the slope of the curve downwards the quicker the\r\nrate of drying, and that when the curve takes an upward direction there is\r\nan addition of moisture instead of abstraction. It will be noted that when\r\ndrying takes place the slopes more nearly approximating the vertical\r\nrepresent the extent of day drying, and that often the night drying is\r\nrepresented either by a very flat curve or even by an upward curve which\r\nshows the addition of moisture. A striking feature of the experiment is\r\nshown by the rapidity with which drying takes place during the first few\r\ndays and the comparative slowness with which the remaining moisture is got\r\nrid of. Thus, from the graph, it may be calculated that about 80 per cent.\r\nof the total moisture content was lost in the first two days, and over 93\r\nper cent. in two and a half days. Yet three days had to elapse before the\r\nremaining 7 per cent. of total moisture was lost--_i.e._, before the rubber\r\nwas judged to be ready for packing. It will be seen that after this stage\r\nhad been reached the rubber alternately lost and gained in weight, with a\r\ntendency to increase. This increase was attributed to the presence of\r\nsurface moisture after hanging overnight, when the rains had become\r\nfrequent. Some light is thus shed upon a subject which has puzzled both\r\nshippers and receivers of crepe rubber.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES IN WEIGHT.--It will be obvious that if rubber is allowed to\r\nhang after becoming dry, and is taken down, packed, and weighed in the\r\nearly morning, it will weigh more than when it reaches a drier climate. The\r\nloss in weight under such circumstances might amount to even 1 per cent. It\r\nmay seem to some an unnecessary refinement to introduce, but it would\r\nappear from the graph that rubber should be packed for preference in the\r\nafternoon if the weights are to be more nearly correct.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely singular to note how quickly the curve changes its slope\r\nafter the major portion of the moisture has evaporated, and it will be very\r\nplain that in the last stages any decrease in weight during the day would\r\nappear to be counterbalanced, or more than counterbalanced, by the addition\r\nof moisture during the night. It may be pointed out, however, that this\r\nincrease in weight during the later stages of drying of pale crepe is\r\nmainly, if not altogether, due to surface moisture. The chief point of\r\ninterest is the fact that in the case of thin pale crepe, quite 80 per\r\ncent. of the total moisture content is lost during the first two or three\r\ndays, and that, owing to the negative influence of the night atmosphere,\r\nthe final drying is delayed. It will be understood that the foregoing\r\nresults applied to thin pale crepe. Thin lower-grade crepes appeared to dry\r\nat more uniform rates, but the differences between the rates of drying at\r\nnight and during the day were similarly notable.\r\n\r\nAIDS TO NORMAL AIR-DRYING.--These experiments were undertaken in a\r\ndrying-house, favourably situated for rapid drying, in which the average\r\nperiod of drying for thin crepes is nine days. It is easy to imagine that\r\nthe condition of affairs as revealed would be much exaggerated in a\r\ndrying-house situated on low-lying ground and surrounded by trees. In\r\nextreme cases of this nature the use of large fans and heating pipes has\r\nbeen advocated. It is believed that in some cases these installations have\r\ngiven satisfaction, but that in others the degree of improvement obtained\r\nhas not been in economic proportion to the outlay incurred.\r\n\r\nSMOKE-CURING OF SHEET RUBBER.--It will have been evident that one of the\r\ndisadvantages of air-drying sheet is the incidence of moulds. Now it is\r\nfound that moulds should not develop in smoke-curing; and if they do, then\r\nthe smoke-curing has been insufficient or inefficient. The difference in\r\nthe drying period also is a strong argument in favour of smoke-curing, so\r\nthat all-round it is seen that there are many valuable advantages to be\r\ngained by smoke-curing sheet in comparison with air-drying, and no\r\ndisadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe manipulation of the rubber, after it leaves the marking rolls and\r\npreparatory to smoke-curing, has been discussed in Chapter IX. It is\r\nsufficient only to allow adequate time for furnace water to drip from the\r\nsheets before transferring them to the smoke-house. As it is the general\r\nrule to roll sheet rubber in the morning, this arrangement fits in very\r\nwell. The furnaces of the smoke-house are usually extinguished as soon as\r\nthe sun is well risen, and the rest of the day is occupied in sorting dry\r\nsheets, etc. Towards noon the day's wet sheets should have been admitted,\r\nand smoking may be commenced as soon as the sun is well in the west--say,\r\nat half-past four o'clock or earlier.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the custom on a few estates to smoke during the daytime and\r\nto discontinue smoking at night. As the night-air in Malaya is usually\r\nheavily laden with moisture, it will be plain that such a policy was a\r\ntopsy-turvy one. It is vastly more reasonable to smoke-cure at night;\r\nusually the heat of the sun during the day is quite sufficient in itself to\r\npromote the drying of rubber; but there is no reason why smoking should not\r\nbe carried on in the daytime in wet weather, should it be found expedient\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nRECORDING INSTRUMENTS.--During the night the care of the smoke-houses is\r\nusually in the hands of natives, except for occasional surprise visits from\r\na European superintendent. To all acquainted with the ways of the native it\r\nmust be plain that means must be provided for the checking of the\r\ntemperatures attained in the smoke-house. Ordinary thermometers are quite\r\nunsuitable, and even thermometers registering maximum and minimum\r\ntemperatures are of little avail, inasmuch as they record only the degree\r\nof heat attained at a particular moment, and do not indicate any period\r\nduring which a particular temperature was maintained.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that something more informative is required. There are many\r\ntypes of suitable recording instruments or \"pyrometers,\" some of which can\r\nbe electrically connected, so as to cause the ringing of a bell, placed in\r\nthe superintendent's office or house, on the attainment of a certain\r\ntemperature. The type best known in estate practice is that named the\r\n\"Thermograph,\" in which a pen traces a curve or graph on a plotted piece of\r\npaper carried by a rotating cylinder which is actuated by clockwork. Such\r\ninstruments can be purchased through most of the local firms dealing in\r\nestate supplies. From experience it can be asserted that, given intelligent\r\nattention, these instruments yield very satisfactory results. The apparatus\r\nshould not be placed always in one position in the smoke-house, but should\r\nbe moved frequently so as to obtain information regarding the distribution\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF SMOKE-CURING.--In the question of temperature of drying, it\r\nis well to be as strict as possible; not that any great harm will result\r\nfrom a rise of 10 deg. above that recommended, but because the higher the\r\ntemperature recorded the larger the fires must have been, and consequently\r\nthe more real danger there was of the store becoming ignited. It has been\r\nshown[14] that the temperature giving the maximum benefit of drying and\r\nquality was found experimentally to be rather above the temperature usually\r\nprescribed for smoke-houses, but in the experimental work there was no\r\ndanger from fire.\r\n\r\n[14] \"Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" Morgan, 1913, chapter x.\r\n\r\nThe figure given in previous publications as a maximum working temperature\r\nfor smoke-houses was 110 deg. F., but certainly the temperature may be as high\r\nas 130 deg. if it is considered safe to allow fires to be so arranged. One or\r\ntwo estates are known to work at temperatures of 130 deg. F. and over, in spite\r\nof the recommendations of the writers. If those estates care to risk it\r\nthey may do so, with increased rapidity of drying; but no responsibility\r\ncan be taken for whatever may happen in smoke-houses where the temperature\r\nis allowed to remain, as in one case, at 160 deg. F. Naturally the range of\r\ntemperature is strictly limited by the properties of the substance to be\r\ntreated, and with a substance such as rubber it would be far better to err\r\non the side of caution than to risk damage to such a commodity, apart from\r\nthe consideration of the possible destruction of the building.\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF DRYING.--Considerable differences are noted in the periods of\r\ndrying on various estates; but, as there is more than one factor\r\ninfluencing the results, it is not easy at first to find why these\r\ndifferences should exist. Really there are three factors:\r\n\r\n     (1) Relative thickness of rubber.\r\n\r\n     (2) Extent and quality of rolling.\r\n\r\n     (3) Temperature of drying.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that the smoke-houses are identical in type and efficiency,\r\nand that smoking is in force for the same length of time each day. There\r\nneed be no discussion of these points; the effect of each is so obvious.\r\nThe thinner the sheet, the quicker the rate of drying; the better the sheet\r\nhas been rolled, the shorter the period of drying; the higher the\r\ntemperature, the more rapid the drying.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in Chapter IX. that the condition of the sheet after\r\nrolling depends primarily upon the standard of dilution of the latex and\r\nthe original thickness of the coagulum. If these factors are correctly\r\ncontrolled, the rolling should give a sheet which is fairly soft and\r\nporous--_i.e._, it should not have been subjected to such pressure as to\r\nmake it both thin and hard. An average sheet of rubber which has been well\r\nrolled should be smoke-dried at a temperature of 120 deg. F. in about ten days.\r\nIf sheets take appreciably longer to dry, then the three foregoing factors\r\nmust be examined.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is often found that thin sheets made from very dilute\r\nlatex dry so quickly that they are considered to be fully smoke-cured in\r\nfrom five to seven days. It frequently happens in such cases, however, that\r\nthe smoking is insufficient, and by the time the rubber reaches home it has\r\nbegun to show signs of surface moulds. It is evident, therefore, from this\r\ndiscussion that:\r\n\r\n     (1) If smoked sheet develops surface moulds within a short period\r\n     after smoking, the duration of curing has been insufficient, or the\r\n     quality of the smoking is at fault.\r\n\r\n     (2) The actual time taken to smoke-dry rubber may be insufficient to\r\n     smoke-cure it.\r\n\r\n     (3) The rate of drying of smoked sheet depends upon--\r\n\r\n          (_a_) The relative thickness of the rubber.\r\n\r\n          (_b_) The preliminary treatment of rolling.\r\n\r\n          (_c_) The temperature of the smoke-house, and\r\n\r\n          (_d_) The type of smoke-house used. This point will be treated\r\n          in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nFUELS FOR SMOKING.--The general idea formerly held was that the beneficial\r\neffects of smoking were to be attributed to the constituents of the smoke,\r\nand chiefly the creosotic substances. This is not now the opinion of the\r\nwriters, who attribute the effect largely to the temperature of drying and\r\nconstituents of the smoke other than creosotic substances. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the presence of creosotic bodies is responsible largely for the\r\nabsence of moulds and the existence of the typical odour, but it is\r\nbecoming increasingly known that the employment of substances rich in\r\ncreosote is not required or desirable.\r\n\r\nEstates used to be put to considerable expense in the purchase of \"bakau\"\r\n(a mangrove timber rich in creosote and creating much heat), under the idea\r\nthat it was the best material and almost indispensable. Most estates now\r\nrestrict themselves to the consumption of timber obtained from their own\r\nareas. Thinning-out programmes are largely responsible for the supply, but\r\nthe local authorities are much concerned regarding future supplies; and\r\nconsideration has been given in some quarters to the question of the\r\ndevelopment of quick-growing trees on estates with a view to safeguarding\r\nthe future. This seems to be desirable, as it is difficult to imagine that\r\nthe place of timber can be taken by any other material in the smoke-curing\r\nof rubber. Unless some such precautions are taken it is not difficult to\r\npredict that, in course of time, some estates will be able to continue the\r\npreparation of smoked sheets only at considerable expense in obtaining\r\nsuitable fuel from a distance.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that _any kind of timber_ is suitable as a fuel to be used\r\nin a smoke-house. All timbers are suitable, either alone or in mixture with\r\nothers, provided that the wood is not too green.\r\n\r\nNaturally an absolutely dead and crumbling wood will smoulder, but does not\r\ndevelop sufficient smoke. A green timber will give an acrid and moist\r\nsmoke, but demands the consumption of a certain amount of dry timber in\r\naddition if it is to be used.\r\n\r\nRubber-tree prunings and sawn rubber trees obtained by thinning-out may be\r\nused in mixture with dead wood, provided the logs are stacked to dry in the\r\nsun for some weeks before use. If the timber is too green, steam is formed\r\nas well as smoke, and the sheets of rubber may have a moist surface glaze.\r\n\r\nSUN-DRYING SHEET RUBBER.--Among the first curious sights which impress the\r\nvisitor or newcomer to this country is the spectacle of sheet rubber\r\nhanging in the sun on native holdings. From what one has learned of the\r\nextraordinary care which must be exercised in all the processes of rubber\r\npreparation, one fails to understand how such rubber reaches the market\r\nwithout becoming tacky. That some of it does become slightly tacky is\r\ncertain, but on the whole native rubber, though crudely prepared, is\r\nusually sound. The native idea of giving sheet rubber a preliminary drying\r\nin the sun is to hasten the total period of drying. That the period is\r\ncurtailed would seem to be the case, but it is open to doubt, as the effect\r\nof sun-drying, if unduly prolonged, is to create a thin surface film of dry\r\nrubber which retards the drying of the rubber below the surface. Working\r\nwith wet crepe rubber, the writer found that, to all external appearances,\r\nthere was no effect upon the rubber when it was allowed to sun-dry for four\r\nor five hours. With periods of from six to ten hours the crepe becomes\r\nslightly sticky, chiefly on that portion across the support. When removed\r\nto the air-drying house this tackiness developed further, and the rubber,\r\non the line of support, became so weak that it stretched and broke.\r\n\r\nReasoning by analogy, it would appear that no apparent harm would result to\r\nsheet rubber from sun-drying for periods up to four or five hours. From\r\nexperience (see Chapter IX.), not the slightest ill-effect is found to\r\nresult from the short interval of preliminary drying or dripping practised\r\non many estates preparatory to smoke-curing.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL DRIERS FOR SHEET RUBBER.--It is understood that when vacuum\r\ndriers were first applied to the drying of rubber it was thought possible\r\nto dry sheet rubber in this way. The practice was found to be impossible,\r\nas the length of time required and the temperature were responsible for the\r\ndestruction of the form of the rubber; it became tacky and semi-liquid.\r\n\r\nTHE \"CHULA\" DRIER.--Although several suggestions of devices for\r\nartificially drying sheet have been made, only one is known to be in use at\r\nthe present time. In the original form this was used for drying other\r\ntropical products. It consists of a large iron chamber, in which are\r\nseveral compartments divided by means of baffle-plates. At one end there is\r\na small furnace and, by means of a fan, smoke and hot air are drawn\r\nthrough the compartments. Owing to the temperature attained (140 deg. to 160 deg.\r\nF.) sheet rubber cannot be completely dried in the chambers, and is, as a\r\nrule, only treated in this manner for one or two days. Drying is then\r\ncompleted in an ordinary air-drying house. It is claimed that drying is\r\nexpedited, and that the rubber can be packed in ten days.\r\n\r\nIn the more recent modification, the smoke and hot air which leave the\r\nChula drier pass through a large room in which may be hung either sheet or\r\ncrepe rubber. It would seem that all sources of danger have not been\r\neliminated from the process, as on one estate a wooden room containing\r\nrubber was ignited by a spark which passed through the drier.\r\n\r\nYet another form exists in which the furnace is outside the main building,\r\nand in the ordinary course of working only heats a series of open pipes\r\nthrough which air is drawn by a powerful fan. By means of a valve it is\r\npossible to allow smoke from the furnace to pass into the room with the hot\r\nair for the preparation of smoked rubber. The hot air or smoke is\r\ndistributed in the lower room by means of main and branch pipes, and passes\r\nthrough an open floor to the room above. With such an arrangement it is\r\npossible, therefore, to prepare either air-dried or smoke-cured rubber. If\r\nthe method could be successfully applied to the drying of crepe it would be\r\nof great assistance on some estates. There would seem to be a difficulty in\r\nworking it for the drying of sheer rubber and crepe together, as the\r\ntemperature suitable for the one is excessive for the other. Given an\r\nefficient control over the temperature of the hot air, the house should be\r\nsuccessful in the drying of crepe, provided the rubber is not hung in folds\r\nof too great length. For smoke-curing sheet rubber the period is said to be\r\nreduced by several days in comparison with the time occupied in an ordinary\r\nsmoke-house, but it is not clear that such a system would have any\r\nadvantage over a modern smoke-house, in types of which rubber can be fully\r\ncured in periods ranging from five to ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_SORTING, GRADING, AND PACKING_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of standardising the output of our plantations is one which\r\nhas occupied attention for some years, with a not inconsiderable degree of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile opinion is growing in favour of proceeding along the line of\r\nreducing the number of plantation grades to a minimum. At present some\r\nconfusion exists. Some estates make up tree-scrap and bark-shavings\r\ntogether; one estate puts tree-scrap, earth-scrap, and bark-shavings into\r\none uniform crepe; other estates have three or more separate scrap\r\ngrades--_e.g._, lump-rubber and \"washings,\" tree-scrap, earth-scrap, and\r\nbark-shavings scrap. There is a movement on foot at present to try to\r\nrestrict plantation rubber to three grades:\r\n\r\nCREPES--1. _First Quality Latex._--_I.e._, crepe made from the true\r\ncoagulum obtained from the regulated coagulation of strained latex. This is\r\na pale rubber, and may be prepared satisfactorily if the directions given\r\nin preceding chapters are followed. Naturally there must be, in all\r\nfactories, some defective rubber of this grade. For various reasons the\r\ncrepe may be of inferior colour, or is slightly contaminated with dirt or\r\ntraces of oil and grease, etc. This defective rubber should be placed aside\r\nmost rigorously and plainly marked as \"off-quality.\"\r\n\r\nIf a proper scheme of standardisation of latex and chemicals is followed,\r\nthere should not be any such variety in shades of colour, such as was\r\ncommon in No. 1 crepe in the past.\r\n\r\nComparatively few estates in Malaya now prepare thick (or blanket) crepes\r\nin the No. 1 grade, but in such cases the same rules must be applied as\r\ngovern the sorting of thin fine pale crepes.\r\n\r\n2. _Compound Crepe, No. 1._--In this it is proposed to include\r\ncup-coagulated lumps, coagulated lumps from transport vessels, skimmings,\r\nbucket rinsings, cup-washings, and tree-scrap. It has been shown in Chapter\r\nX. that strict care is necessary to eliminate all oxidised (dark) scraps.\r\nThese are relegated to a lower grade. The possession of a \"scrap-washer\" is\r\nnecessary if the best results are to be obtained.\r\n\r\nOn some estates the ingredients of this compound crepe, while fresh, are\r\nplaced in a common jar or tank to which a quantity of sodium bisulphite (1\r\nper cent. solution) and acid are added. The resulting conglomerate mass is\r\ncut up for working.\r\n\r\n3. _Compound Crepe, No. 2._--This grade would include the remaining lower\r\ngrades--viz., bark-shavings, scrap, and earth-rubber scrap.\r\n\r\nREDUCTION CARRIED TOO FAR.--However desirable it may be to diminish the\r\nnumber of grades, it must be pointed out that diminution and simplification\r\nare not necessarily synonymous terms in this matter. It is well known that\r\non estates where the earth-rubber is only brought in at lengthy intervals,\r\nsay of a week, the resulting crepe is sometimes very tacky. This is only\r\nnatural, and is due to the prolonged exposure to the sun's rays. With the\r\nimproved machinery now at our disposal, and with the increasing attention\r\nwhich will be given to the lower grades in the future, it is possible to\r\nprepare from average bark-shavings crepe free from bark, and of quite a\r\ngood colour. Where trees are not \"scrapped\" before tapping, there would\r\nseem to be no objection to amalgamating the rubber obtained from the\r\nbark-shavings with the No. 1 Compound crepe; and it would be a distinct\r\ndanger and possible loss if this good rubber were to be mixed with earth\r\nrubber. The liability of the latter to become tacky is well recognised; and\r\nif possible it should be maintained as a separate grade, in which it would\r\nbe permissible to mix only rubber obtained from actually dry shavings from\r\n\"scrapped\" trees, or heavily-oxidised scraps which have been rejected from\r\nother grades.\r\n\r\nSHEETS.--Broadly there are no fine distinctions to be made at present in\r\nthe grading of smoked-sheet rubber; it is either No. 1, or if any\r\nso-called defect is visible the sheets must be rejected and plainly marked\r\nas \"off-quality.\"\r\n\r\nClippings (trimmings) may either be made into crepe or shipped under their\r\nown description.\r\n\r\nRUBBER GROWERS' ASSOCIATION'S RECOMMENDATIONS.--Taking the foregoing\r\narguments into full consideration, it would seem that, strictly speaking,\r\nthe number of grades cannot be reduced to less than four at present without\r\nproducing some amount of confusion.\r\n\r\nIn its handbook,[15] the Rubber Growers' Association remarks:\r\n\r\n[15] \"Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" 1917.\r\n\r\n     \"The fewer grades the better, and regularity of each grade is most\r\n     important.\r\n\r\n     \"The grading should be as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"(No. 1) Fine crepe (or No. 1 sheet), made from the free or\r\n          liquid latex.\r\n\r\n          \"(No. 2) Clean light brown crepe, made from lumps and skimmings.\r\n\r\n          \"(No. 3) Scrap crepe, made from tree-scrap.\r\n\r\n          \"(No. 4) Dark crepe, made from bark-shavings, earth rubber, and\r\n          the lower quality of scrap.\r\n\r\n          \"Tacky rubber should be packed separately.\r\n\r\n\"_Compound Scrap Crepe._--Estates using scrap-washers should make a\r\ncompound crepe of grades Nos. 2 and 3, which will make one compound free\r\nfrom bark and specks. All rubber intended for No. 4 should be most\r\nthoroughly washed.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning these recommendations the remarks in preceding paragraphs should\r\nbe studied.\r\n\r\nCARE IN SORTING.--Whether dealing with smoked-sheet, pale crepe, or lower\r\ngrades, the strictest care is necessary in sorting and grading. This work\r\nmust of necessity be relegated to coolies, and they should be trained men.\r\nInstructions must be definite, and doubtful specimens of rubber should\r\nalways be placed aside for the decision of the European superintendent. Any\r\npieces showing unmistakable signs of what are regarded as defects should be\r\nstringently rejected. In the case of pale crepe, when the defect is\r\nconfined only to a small area it is permissible to cut out the affected\r\nportion. Similarly there can be no objection, in the case of smoked sheets,\r\nto an occasional sheet being treated in this manner. On the majority of\r\nestates these rules are observed carefully, but some estates yet have to\r\nlearn that defective pieces of rubber may not be concealed in a bulk of\r\notherwise good quality. Samplers have often an uncanny knack of hitting\r\nupon the defective specimens, and it is entirely the fault of the estate's\r\nsorters if these pieces are submitted as being representative of the mass.\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF CASES.--Consumers complain justly of the presence of chips,\r\nsplinters, and wood-dust. It will be evident, therefore, that whatever the\r\ntype of case employed the interior surfaces should be smooth, there should\r\nbe no cracks or gaps in the timber, and the cases should be cleaned out\r\nbefore using. There remains great room for improvement in the means and\r\nmethod of packing, and in spite of suggested alternatives we are at present\r\nrestricted to the use of wooden cases.\r\n\r\nFrom comparisons of actual quality and fulfilment of the requirements\r\nindicated above, there can be no question that cases made of three-ply\r\nwood, such as the \"Venesta,\" are in every respect superior to the ordinary\r\nwooden cases of \"Momi\" type. The consideration of cost and available\r\nsupplies, of course, enters largely into the question, and three-ply cases\r\nare not at present so largely employed as they deserve to be.\r\n\r\nA new type of case was recently exhibited in Singapore. It emanates from\r\nthe U.S.A. and is made of a fibrous material, resembling in appearance a\r\nvery stout cardboard. The complete case when assembled consists really of\r\ntwo boxes, one of which is inverted and slides down over the other. Packing\r\nis completed by means of stout wire, which is strained by a simple ratchet\r\narrangement. It is claimed that from 225 to 250 lbs. of rubber can be\r\ncontained. Other claims made amount to the statement that the case is\r\npractically indestructible under normal conditions of handling and\r\nshipping. A demonstration given certainly appeared to substantiate the\r\nstatement fully. Rubber packed in cases of various and average type was\r\nallowed to fall from a height of about twenty feet. In all instances the\r\nwooden cases of every type were either smashed or badly burst, whereas the\r\nfibre cases were merely dented. These cases are obtained in flat sections,\r\nwhich, in assembling, are folded and clamped by means of copper rivets in\r\na special but simple machine. It was pointed out that objection might be\r\nlodged against the use of copper for this purpose.\r\n\r\nMore recently there is announced a new packing case which is stated to be\r\nmade from low-grade rubbers, but information is rather vague.\r\n\r\nBAGS.--There are in local use stout canvas bags which have the advantage of\r\nbeing used many times, as long as they are waterproof and kept in good dry\r\ncondition. Their employment for the conveyance of smoked-sheets would\r\nappear to be permitted, but crepe rubbers sent in them are often reported\r\nupon as being \"massed\" at the edges, and hence difficult to \"sample.\"\r\n\r\nBALES.--Attempts to bale rubber for the market have been frequent, but no\r\nsuccess seems to have attended the efforts. In some quarters the failure\r\nhas been ascribed to prejudice on the part of buyers, but it is the opinion\r\nof the writers that the objections to baling are, or could be,\r\nwell-founded. Massed rubber often cannot be inspected properly, and hence\r\nis always open to suspicion that internally there may be unsuitable\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nThere have been several schemes put forward for winding crepe rubber on\r\nspindles so as to form a cylindrical package complete in itself. We have\r\nseen the process, and certainly the method had much which appeared\r\ncommendable. Apart from other objections which might be raised, there is\r\nalways the one prominent objection mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nWhile baling of rubber is thus not likely to suit the general market, there\r\nis no reason why, as in one or two instances, it should not be practised by\r\nagreement between producer and consumer. It is believed that \"slab\" rubber\r\nis shipped in bales from Sumatra to the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nQuite recently a proposal has been put forward to revert to a simple form\r\nof baling for ordinary plantation rubber. Under this scheme wooden cases\r\nare discarded, the packing material being composed of scrap-grade crepe\r\nrubber which, it is claimed, could be put to use by the manufacturer. An\r\nobvious drawback would be evident if these bales happened to be exposed to\r\ndirect sunlight or a continuous high temperature. The tackiness which might\r\nsupervene would make the handling of such bales unpleasant, even if it did\r\nnot affect the internal rubber.\r\n\r\nFOLDING FOR PACKING.--In the packing of smoked sheets it would appear to be\r\nadvisable to avoid, if possible, the folding of any pieces, as the\r\nobjection is made that such rubber is difficult to \"sample\" on arrival,\r\nespecially in cold weather. Sheets should be prepared or cut to such length\r\nthat they occupy the full superficial area of the box, either singly or\r\nside by side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHIPMENT OF RUBBER, PACKED AND READY FOR TRANSPORT.]\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to the packing of crepe rubbers, except that here\r\nwe deal with units of folded rubber. Crepes are generally folded by hand,\r\nand coolies usually work to a certain dimension by means of a standard\r\nstick. The work is slow, but often gives employment, at a cheap rate of\r\npay, to women and weak coolies.\r\n\r\nSeveral machines have been invented to replace this labour. The best of\r\nthese yet seen has a simple device by means of which the length of the fold\r\nis adjustable to suit the size of any packing case. It is called the\r\n\"Senang\" folder, and is made by the General Engineering Company (Radcliffe)\r\nLtd., Radcliffe, near Manchester.\r\n\r\nCARE IN ASSEMBLING.--Whatever the type of case employed, great care must be\r\ngiven to the assembling of parts and the final fastening. It is not\r\nuncommon to find in the operation of putting on the \"strapping\" that nails\r\nhave been driven into the rubber. Extra bands of strapping are sometimes\r\nadvised, and where these bands pass over the sides (not edges) of the case\r\nonly specially short nails should be used.\r\n\r\nAll wood should be planed, and in cases other than three-ply should be of\r\nstout wood, not less than 5/8 inch in thickness. All timber used should be\r\nof uniform type and thickness.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF PACKING.--The usual method of packing crepe is to fold the\r\nlengths to some measure of the dimensions of the case. This is done in a\r\nhaphazard fashion on some estates, with the result that either space is\r\nlost or the packing is badly arranged.\r\n\r\nSome ingenuity can be displayed in the packing of sheet rubber in order to\r\navoid folding the sheets, which, besides increasing the difficulty of\r\nsampling, leads to loss of space. Endeavours are being continually made on\r\nestates to prepare sheet of such a size as to obtain the maximum benefit of\r\nspace both in smoke-house accommodation and in packing. A few estates\r\nemploy tanks of such calculated dimensions as will yield uniform sheets\r\nwhich pack flat and fill the superficial area of the case.\r\n\r\nIn view of the contamination which sometimes characterises the employment\r\nof wooden cases it is sometimes advised that the interior should be lined\r\nwith sheets, or pieces of crepe, the ends of which are later folded over\r\nthe top of the mass. In this manner it is stated that contamination is\r\nconfined only to the exterior of the contents of the case.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF CONTENTS.--The dimensions of average cases are 19 inches by 19\r\ninches by 24 inches, giving a capacity of 5 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nIn these it is possible to pack 150 lbs. of crepe rubber and 200 lbs. of\r\nsheet rubber (about 5 per cent. more in cases of three-ply wood). It may\r\nbe noted that boxes arrive in better condition when fully packed. The\r\nforegoing figures are not adhered to strictly. For example, some estates\r\nfind it expedient to ship rubber in actual ton lots, and for this purpose\r\npack only 140 lbs. of crepe per case, giving sixteen cases to the ton.\r\nOther estates, using presses, pack more per case than the quantities noted\r\nabove. At present there does not appear to be any definite regularity in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON ITS ROAD TO THE RAILWAY: BULLOCK-CART TRANSPORT.]\r\n\r\nIn all instances it should be the invariable rule that the rubber should be\r\nweighed before packing, and that all cases should contain uniform nett\r\nquantities of any particular type of rubber. Invoicing, etc., will thus be\r\ngreatly facilitated. If these practices are followed, and the rubber always\r\nweighed on the same scales (assuming it to be perfectly dry when packed)\r\ncomplaints of \"short-weight\" should be infrequent.\r\n\r\n\"SHORT\" WEIGHTS.--In some cases the occurrence of \"short\" weights on\r\narrival at ports would appear to be inexplicable. It often happens that the\r\nconstituent parts of wooden cases have been in stock for a considerable\r\nperiod. If for no other reason than that indicated below, all cases,\r\neither before or after assembling, should be thoroughly dried in the sun.\r\n\"Short\" weight could be accounted for to some degree by a lack of\r\nobservance of this elementary rule, as it is most probable that there would\r\nbe a perceptible difference in weight of the wooden case in a drier\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) If rubber is weighed in the box, and the average tare of the\r\n     case deducted from the gross weight (in order to obtain the nett\r\n     weight), any loss in the weight of the timber would appear as a\r\n     deficiency of rubber at the distant port.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Whether the same effect would be produced eventually in the case\r\n     of rubber which is weighed before packing will depend upon the method\r\n     of weighing at the warehouse. If the rubber is weighed in the box, any\r\n     observed deficiency would be attributed to a loss of weight in the\r\n     rubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nMACHINERY AND BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_MACHINES_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of manufacturers of machines for preparing rubber would seem to\r\nbe on the increase, and there can be little doubt that this competition\r\nwill result in a continued improvement in the design of machines. It cannot\r\nbe denied that there has been room for such improvement, and it is believed\r\nthat manufacturers will display judgment in putting only their best quality\r\ninto the work. While design and finish are very excellent in their way, it\r\nis to be regretted that in a number of cases in the past the material of\r\nrolls has been found to be of inferior quality. Generally, the complaint\r\nseemed to be that the rolls were too soft, and that the \"grinding\" effect\r\nwas far too great. The damage to pale rubber in such cases is considerable,\r\nas it is impossible to keep the rolls free from fine dark powder. The\r\neffect is generally noticed more in the smooth rolls with which a finish is\r\nput upon the crepe.\r\n\r\nCases have occurred frequently in which rolls have been returned, because\r\nof the injury caused to pale rubber, and there can be little doubt that the\r\nlife of quite a large number of rolls is even now far too short in\r\ncomparison with the expense involved.\r\n\r\nIt is a moot point, however, in many instances how far the quality of the\r\nrolls is actually responsible for the damage done to the rubber. In the\r\nexperience of the writers it is certain that complaints regarding the rolls\r\nwere unjustifiable, and that the injury had been caused by carelessness in\r\nthe \"feeding\" of the machine. Especially in the case of smooth finishing\r\nrolls, it is clear that if the rolls are allowed to run idle for more than\r\nthe briefest possible interval grinding must take place.\r\n\r\nThe complaints apply not only to the rolls themselves, but also to the\r\nbrass linings for shaft-bearings. Cases are known in which a brass \"liner\"\r\nwas so worn within a few weeks as to be quite useless. If the matter ended\r\nthere it would not be so bad; but there is always the possibility of\r\nparticles of brass finding their way into trays, and so into the rubber.\r\nThe damage which ensues to the rubber is quite irreparable. This particular\r\ndefect arising from the presence of brass will be dealt with in a later\r\nchapter. But here again it is necessary to point out that such wear on\r\nbrass liners may be caused by the standards (ends) of the rolls being\r\neccentric; and the case may be analogous to the placing of \"new wine in old\r\nbottles.\"\r\n\r\n_En passant_ it may be remarked that in any case brass liners are not\r\nstrictly necessary. White-metal alloys are in use on rubber machines, and\r\ncast-iron bearings have been employed satisfactorily for years.\r\n\r\nIt would be well for managers to remember, therefore, that when machines\r\nhave to be ordered, nothing but the best is good enough, and that the\r\ndifference between good machinery and passable machinery is probably\r\nimmensely greater in effect than any saving in expenditure would warrant.\r\n\r\nADEQUACY OF MACHINES.--In general, the factories which prepare sheet rubber\r\nare usually equipped with adequate machinery. This arises from the fact\r\nthat machines are necessary for preparing all grades below the first, even\r\nif they are not necessary for the making of sheet. Thus all the necessary\r\nmacerators and finishing machines are installed, but the major part of the\r\noutput is in sheet form. For the preparation of sheet, no heavy machinery\r\nis required; all that is necessary are light machines for rolling the\r\nsheets and expressing as much moisture as possible. To obtain a pattern on\r\nthe sheet, another light machine may be used. It may be imagined, then,\r\nthat the work of rolling sheet rubber by power machines is small, and that\r\na large quantity of rubber can be worked off in a comparatively short time.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the preparation of the lower crepe grades can\r\nbe proceeded with at once, and that the whole work of the factory is\r\nexpedited.\r\n\r\nThe case of factories which have to prepare all first-grade rubber in crepe\r\nform is quite different, especially when thin rubber has to be made. The\r\ncare which has to be exercised in preparing pale crepe rubber is very great\r\nin comparison with what is demanded by sheet rubber. The rubber has to go\r\nfirst through the uneven-speed macerators, from there to the intermediate\r\nrollers, thence to the finishing rollers. Considerable ingenuity has to be\r\ndisplayed in the arrangement of the machines, so that one section will not\r\nwork faster or slower than another. More often than not, the attempt to\r\narrive at such a desirable arrangement fails, owing to an insufficiency of\r\nmachines. Such a statement will probably read strangely to the uninitiated;\r\nbut an example will make it plain. A factory may have a battery of six\r\nmachines, one only of which is a finishing machine (smooth rolls). With\r\nfive macerators and intermediate machines working continuously, it will be\r\nmore than the work of one finishing pair of rolls to keep pace, especially\r\nas so much more care has to be exercised in finishing than in rough\r\ncrepe-making. The obvious course to adopt is to substitute a pair of smooth\r\nrolls, with suitable gear ratio, for a pair of macerators or\r\n\"intermediates.\"\r\n\r\nIf, however, the macerators and intermediates are already fully occupied\r\nthe whole of the time, any such change would be of small benefit. What is\r\nreally needed in this case is more machinery.\r\n\r\nIt might be pertinently asked what constitutes an adequate equipment of\r\nmachines for crepe-making. The writers cannot give a number, but have no\r\nhesitation in stating that if a factory cannot complete its whole day's\r\nwork before dark, it is inadequately equipped. No work should be done after\r\ndark, if possible, as it cannot receive the supervision which crepe-making\r\ndemands. To make comparison between the number of machines in any two\r\nfactories and their respective outputs is not sound argument, as the\r\nout-turn of two similar machines will depend upon the speed at which the\r\nrolls travel--_i.e._, the gearing between the machines and the engines.\r\nThus, while one machine will out-turn 40 lbs. of crepe per hour, another\r\nmay only have an output of 30 lbs., although the machines may be identical\r\nin pattern. To make calculations based on a rate per hour for any known\r\nmake of machine, and to apply those calculations to the existing machinery\r\nin any factory, in an attempt to judge whether there is a sufficient number\r\nof machines, would be a mistake, unless one were also supplied with the\r\nrelative speeds at which the rolls work.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the question of adequacy of machines, it must be pointed out\r\nthat an insufficient number of machines must result in a poor product,\r\nsince all rolls have to be used for all grades. Even with the greatest\r\npossible care it happens that pale crepe is sometimes spoiled because it is\r\ncontaminated with foreign matter, resulting from the working of lower\r\ngrades on the same machines. This is one of the great arguments in another\r\ndirection for the installation of a scrap-washer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writers can only give their opinion that one must not\r\ndecide the question of adequacy by the number of existing machines, but by\r\nthe time taken each day in working off the rubber, providing one can be\r\nsatisfied that the best arrangement of the existing machines has been made.\r\n\r\nIDEAL ARRANGEMENT.--As to what this best arrangement may be, guidance can\r\nbe obtained from the results of experience here given. It must be premised\r\nthat the output of any factory preparing fine pale crepe is limited by the\r\noutput of the smooth finishing rolls. Broadly, it will be recognised that\r\nif there is any excess of capacity in a battery it should be found in the\r\nsmooth-roll machines. This sufficiency, or excess of capacity, may\r\nsometimes be attained by an alteration in the gearing of the drive of the\r\nrolls from the back-shaft, or by an addition to the number of machines. In\r\nthe former case, there are practicable limits of speed, beyond which the\r\nsecond alternative measure must be adopted.\r\n\r\nSPEED.--The usual speed at which the back-shaft travels ranges from 60 to\r\n70 revolutions per minute. Taking first the macerating machines, the\r\nintermediate gearing between the shaft and the rolls should give a driving\r\nspeed of about 20 revolutions per minute on the faster-travelling roll.\r\nThis is equivalent, with a 15-inch diameter roll, to a peripheral speed of\r\nabout 60 to 65 feet per minute.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate and smooth rolls can be arranged to travel more quickly,\r\nbut the maximum comfortable speed for proper feeding and control appears to\r\nbe about 25 revolutions per minute on even-speed rolls. In view of the fact\r\nthat the rubber at each successive machine becomes longer and thinner, it\r\nwill be seen that a smooth-roll machine could not cope with the output of a\r\nmacerator in the same period of time. If, therefore, the macerator is fully\r\noccupied for the greater part of the time, an additional smooth-roll\r\nmachine must be installed, even though the existing one has been \"speeded\r\nup\" to practicable limits.\r\n\r\nFor the information of the uninitiated it might be explained that in the\r\nmacerating and intermediate machines the cog-wheels driving the two rolls\r\nare of different sizes (_i.e._, differentially geared), as opposed to the\r\nsmooth rolls on which the cog-wheels are usually of the same size (_i.e._,\r\neven speed). The idea in the one case is to exert a \"working\" influence\r\nupon the rubber while it is being washed by the stream of water coming from\r\nabove; in the smooth rolls a squeezing action only is effected.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the ratio of the speeds of the rolls in each machine in\r\na typical working battery, the following particulars may be noted:\r\n\r\nGEAR RATIOS.--\r\n\r\n               _Machine._            _Differential Ratio._\r\n\r\n  1. Macerator                              32-17\r\n  2. Intermediate (coarse grooved)          32-17\r\n  3.      \"       (fine grooved)            30-19\r\n  4. Smooth (uneven speed)                  30-19\r\n  5.  \"     (finishing)                     25-24\r\n  6.  \"     ( \"  )                          25-24\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the so-called \"even-speed\" smooth rolls run at\r\napproximately the same rate.\r\n\r\nIt is advised that in all cases the gear wheels should be cut helically.\r\nThose who have experience of the noise of some batteries after they are\r\nslightly worn will appreciate such a remark.\r\n\r\nGROOVING OF ROLLS.--Concerning the choice of grooving, there is divergence\r\nof opinion, some managers preferring one type, which others reject in\r\nfavour of another type. Provided any particular type can be shown to be as\r\neffective as required, no necessity for laying down hard-and-fast rules\r\nseems to exist.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars serve to describe a battery well known to the\r\nwriters, and accustomed to produce the finest quality of thin pale crepe\r\nand lower grades:\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-----------------------------------+-------------\r\n                   |                                   |_No. of Times\r\n     _Machine._    |         _Grooving._               |Rubber passes\r\n                   |                                   |  through._\r\n  -----------------+-----------------------------------+-------------\r\n  1.

This is about 180 lbs. per hour, while the output of the\r\nmacerator is approximately double this amount. Thus the macerator only\r\nworks for about half the time. This applies also to the two intermediate\r\nmachines. After a study of the preliminary remarks, it would not be\r\ndifficult to suggest methods for improving the condition of affairs. It\r\nwould appear that, in order to obtain a uniform rate of working in such a\r\nbattery, the relative peripheral speeds of the several machines should\r\nbe--(1), (2), and (3) 100; (4) 150; (5) and (6) 200. The remarks on the\r\npractical limits of speed should be borne in mind. In this case the smooth\r\nrolls travelled at 23 revolutions per minute.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, it is not intended to lay down definitely that, _e.g._,\r\nhorizontal grooving alone should be cut on macerating rolls. Some estates\r\nemploy with satisfaction a deep square-cut spiral 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by\r\n1/4 inch or 1/2 inch spacing; others use a large diamond pattern. Similarly\r\nvarious types of grooving are cut in the intermediate rolls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BATTERY OF MACHINES.\r\n\r\nOn the left, light marking rolls for sheet rubber; on the right, heavy\r\nmachines for crepe preparation. In the middle background, \"scrap-washing\"\r\nmachines outside the main building.]\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked in the chapter dealing with crepe preparation that\r\nmuch depends upon the condition of the coagulum. There is no necessity, or\r\ndesirability, for having a standard higher than 2 lbs. dry rubber per\r\ngallon, and it has been argued that it would be better to select a standard\r\nof 1-1/2 lbs. The tougher the coagulum, the more the power required, and\r\nthe slower the rate of output of the leading machines.\r\n\r\nIn ordering machines for crepe-making, only large rolls should be\r\nconsidered--_e.g._, rolls having a diameter of 12 inches to 18 inches and\r\nfrom 15 inches to 18 inches face.\r\n\r\nROLLS RUNNING HOT OR \"FREE.\"--If the rolls are found to become hot, work on\r\nthat machine should be stopped, and an examination made, otherwise there\r\nis the possibility of the crepe becoming sticky and \"tacky\" when dry.\r\n\r\nAlthough comparatively cold water may be flowing upon the rubber and the\r\nrolls, little alleviation may be noticed, inasmuch as the source of heat\r\nlies generally at the bearing ends of the rolls. This may be tested by\r\nplacing the hand on the top of the \"standard\" of the machine. The\r\ndevelopment of the heat may be due to lack of lubrication, worn bearings,\r\nor sometimes faulty setting-up of the machines.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the necessity for avoiding the running \"free\" of\r\nrolls--_i.e._, in the absence of rubber. The grinding of the rolls, when\r\nworking close together, produces a fine powder, which causes a more or less\r\npronounced deposit on pale crepe. When the rolls have been in action for\r\nsome time and become slightly worn, this deposit may be confined only to\r\nthe edges of the rubber.\r\n\r\nSHEETING MACHINES.--The foregoing paragraphs have dealt entirely with\r\nmachines for crepe preparation. Concerning machines for use in\r\nsheet-making, the ground has been mainly covered in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nWhere both crepe and sheet are made, it is permissible and advantageous to\r\nuse the heavy smooth rolls for the rolling of the sheets, and it is only\r\nnecessary to instal one or two light machines for placing a pattern on the\r\nrubber.\r\n\r\nWhere a heavy battery does not exist, light machines with smooth rolls may\r\nbe employed satisfactorily. Even engine-power is not necessary for the\r\npreparation of excellent sheets, but the output is limited where hand-power\r\nonly is employed. Estates are known on which upwards of 1,000 lbs of sheet\r\nrubber are made daily with hand-power machinery in one station. Beyond this\r\nfigure, it is deemed advisable to instal a small engine, say of 7-9\r\nhorse-power. This is ample to drive a battery of three smooth-roll machines\r\nand two markers, and yet have sufficient reserve to actuate a small pump\r\nfor the water supply.\r\n\r\nLUBRICATION OF MACHINES.--It must always appear to those inexperienced in\r\nengineering matters that existing methods for lubricating rubber machinery\r\nare distinctly crude, when one considers the delicacy of the material to\r\nbe prepared. Many existing machines are still lubricated with oil, which\r\nhas to be administered in generous quantities. Generally, such machines\r\nhave been so designed that the excess of oil may find an easy passage into\r\nthe tray which receives the rubber. If not, it drops just outside the tray\r\nto the floor, and is washed away in great gouts. Even where grease-cap\r\nlubricators are fitted it is common to find that the excess can often be\r\ntransferred from the bearings to the trays and so to the rubber. One would\r\nhave expected from the attention which is being given to machinery for\r\nrubber estates that some improvement in lubrication methods would have been\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, however, that a great deal of the disabilities attaching to\r\npresent methods of lubrication might be obviated if closer attention were\r\ngiven to the actual operation of the lubricators. Coolies should not be\r\nallowed to handle them, and the responsibility should be placed upon a\r\nforeman or the engine-driver.\r\n\r\nTRAYS.--The most unsuitable and damage-causing part of the vast majority of\r\nmachines, without doubt, is the tray. On nearly all machines the tray is\r\nwider than the effective portion of the rolls, so that any excess of\r\nlubricant may drop into it. On others, not only is the tray wider than the\r\nrolls, but its edge either is in contact with the shaft of a roll or just a\r\nsmall distance away. The edge of the tray is thus favourably situated for\r\nacting as a \"wipe,\" and the lubricant is transferred to the inside of the\r\ntray. Considering that the effective portion of rolls is about two-thirds\r\nof their length, it must be unnecessary to have trays wider than the length\r\nof the rolls. For the preparation of fine crepe trays are quite\r\nsuperfluous, and their place can be taken by a narrow piece of board if\r\nrequired. If the bed of the machines has been covered with glazed tiles,\r\neven a piece of board is not necessary. Where trays have been removed from\r\nthe fine-crepe rolls on a number of estates, a marked decrease in the\r\nnumber of spoiled pieces of rubber has resulted.\r\n\r\nIt must be recorded that the foregoing paragraph appeared in our 1913\r\npublication. After a lapse of over seven years, the remarks remain as true\r\nas when originally written. One of us is continually meeting with cases in\r\nwhich the defects are plainly attributable to the cause indicated above,\r\nand the fault often lies with the management of estates. On most machines\r\nthe trays are not fixtures, and could be removed if desired.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF MACHINES.--In considering the future arrangement of\r\nmachines, the first care should be to see that machines and windows are to\r\nbe found together.[16] Of all the factory operations, rolling of rubber\r\nshould be given the maximum light. At the same time it would not be\r\nadvisable always to choose a southern aspect, unless outside shades were\r\nsupplied. The best position for setting up machines, therefore, is along a\r\nwall having a number of windows. This is extremely convenient also from the\r\nview of power transmission, and gives the maximum free floor space to the\r\nfactory. In setting up machines, foresight must be displayed, otherwise one\r\nmay find, when future extensions are made, that the extra machines may\r\nobstruct an entry or exit.\r\n\r\n[16] Windows imply the existence of walls. Such is the conventional design\r\nof factories. It may be pointed out that walls are not necessary. The roof\r\nmay be supported on pillars between which expanded metal of large size may\r\nbe placed. This fulfils all requirements and gives the maximum of light and\r\nair. Many new factories have been erected to such a design.\r\n\r\nFor the actual erection of machines, no labour should be accepted without\r\nEuropean supervision. At present there are machines which are practically\r\nuseless owing to faulty workmanship, and on many machines bearings run hot\r\nfor no apparent or explicable reason. Whether the fault lies with the\r\nturning of the rolls or the setting of the machine cannot be decided; but\r\nat any rate too much care cannot be expended on the supervision of setting\r\nup machines.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why everything in a factory should not be made as easy\r\nto clean as possible. For this desirable condition all machines should have\r\nthe beds faced with tiles. A word of caution should be given against using\r\nmarble slabs under the machines, as they would be eroded in time by the\r\nslight amount of acid washed out of the rubber. There would be no such\r\nobjection against the use of white glazed tiles, if they are well set.\r\n\r\nACCESS TO BACK OF MACHINE.--In a few factories it has been noticed that the\r\ndrainage of water from the machines runs to the front of them. This means\r\nthat the coolies are put to unnecessary inconvenience and discomfort, and\r\nthey often suffer from sore feet. All water should drain to the back of the\r\nmachines. The necessity for seeing that these drains are kept clear might\r\nthen induce those in charge to examine the back of the machines. It is\r\noften the case that, while the front of the rolls and tray are kept clean,\r\nlittle attempt is made to cleanse those parts which are not visible or\r\naccessible from the front. There should be no need to point out that any\r\nlabour expended in such \"front-window\" work is rendered useless by the\r\ncontamination from accumulations of old rubber and grease at the back of\r\nthe machines. In the course of visiting factories one of us has many times\r\nseen great surprise exhibited by the manager or assistants on being shown\r\nthe state of affairs at the back of the machines. There should have been no\r\noccasion for such surprise, for the back of the machines is quite as\r\naccessible to them as to the visitor.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it might be said that the manager needing advice as to the\r\nbest machines cannot go far wrong in purchasing any of the better-known\r\nmakes, such as Shaw's, Bridge's, Robinson's, Bertram's, Walker's, Carter's,\r\nIddon's, etc. This list does not include local manufacturers such as the\r\n\"United Engineers.\" It must not be imagined that their machines are not\r\nrecommended. As a matter of fact, their machines compare well with those\r\nmade at Home. It would be well to judge in the final decision upon--\r\n\r\n     1. Cost.\r\n\r\n     2. The experience of those already using the machines.\r\n\r\n     3. Simplicity of parts.\r\n\r\n     4. Lubrication system.\r\n\r\n     5. Mode of adjusting rolls.\r\n\r\n     6. Fitting of trays.\r\n\r\nENGINES.--It is not intended here to discuss particular makes of engines,\r\nor even to attempt to lay down definite statements with regard to the type\r\nof engine. Without a full knowledge of local circumstances, it is not\r\npossible to recommend whether the engine shall be oil-driven, gas-driven,\r\nor steam-driven.\r\n\r\nAssuming a copious supply of very cheap timber, there could be no objection\r\nto the employment of a steam-engine; but for most estates such a choice is\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\nAgain, in deciding between oil and gas, local economic factors must be\r\nconsidered. Suction-gas plants are now made, in which a wonderful variety\r\nof refuse can be consumed in the production of gas, whereas ordinarily\r\nestates are restricted to the use of either charcoal or anthracite coal.\r\nBoth oil and gas driven engines are eminently suitable for the purpose of a\r\nrubber factory, and the results obtained on different estates with either\r\nare often discussed in favour of one or the other. The selection ultimately\r\nnarrows itself down to one of cost of running, in which availability of\r\nsupplies becomes an essential feature.\r\n\r\nPOWER.--No matter what type is selected, there should be made an ample\r\nallowance for margin of power. The general experience of estates has been\r\nthat when the first portion of the estate comes into bearing, there is a\r\ndesire to avoid great outlay, which should really have been secured in the\r\noriginal capital. The result has been that as later the estate expands, the\r\noriginal power unit is found to be inadequate, and a larger engine has to\r\nbe purchased. In a short while the original engine is found to be\r\nunsuitable even as a \"stand-by,\" inasmuch as it is incapable of doing more\r\nthan a portion of the work required. This means eventually that another\r\nlarge engine is required. Had sufficient margin of power been allowed\r\noriginally, only two engines would have been bought, as against the three\r\nindicated above. Without going into finer details, it is usual to allow a\r\nrate of 10 horse-power per heavy machine used for crepe preparation. In\r\nactual practice, when a battery is working under full load, the power\r\ndemanded is about 6 horse-power per machine. Thus a 50 horse-power engine\r\nrunning six machines and a scrap-washer is really running with only a small\r\nmargin of power, and if large pieces of hard coagulum are placed in the\r\nwasher or the macerator there may be a sudden stoppage. Assuming an average\r\nestate commences with only three machines for crepe-making, on an expanding\r\nprogramme, allowance of power should be made for six machines and a\r\nscrap-washer, if the purchase of larger power units is to be avoided\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_FACTORIES_\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSTRUCTION.--On the question of general construction there is\r\nlittle to be said, except that buildings are now being properly designed in\r\nmore permanent form than were some of the earlier buildings. On the whole\r\nthere is little fault to be found with factories in general, except in so\r\nfar as the output has outgrown the accommodation.\r\n\r\nMost factories are now erected in iron, but there are a few which are built\r\nof bricks. It should be premised that a factory in which rubber is to be\r\nprepared should be as light and airy as possible. In this respect quite a\r\nnumber of the older factories are lacking, and they seem to have been\r\ndesigned to exclude as much air and light as possible. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the building is always dark, there is always an air of\r\ndampness, dirt may accumulate, and there is usually a bad smell. Rubber\r\nprepared under these conditions is always liable to be below the high\r\nstandard which should be attained, and the general tone of the factory is\r\ndepressing.\r\n\r\nPLENTY OF LIGHT.--The old idea that light must be excluded is now known to\r\nbe erroneous; so that in designing a factory, provision should be made for\r\nample light and air. It should not be forgotten that in tropical climates,\r\niron buildings may become uncomfortably hot, as most of our older factories\r\nare. Usually it will be found that the ventilation is imperfect. There is a\r\nlack of window space, and the roof is imperfectly ventilated. The ridge of\r\nthe roof should be opened up by means of a \"jack-roof,\" so that the warm\r\nair rising naturally may escape at the highest point of the building. These\r\nare defects which should be remedied in old buildings.\r\n\r\nAs a rule no rubber remains in the factory at night-time, except in the\r\nform of coagulum, the loss of any of which would be noted with ease. The\r\nconventional idea of enclosing the factory with walls of galvanised\r\nsheeting, wood, or brick, is not strictly necessary. In modern buildings\r\nthese walls are replaced by large-mesh expanded metal, thus making the\r\nmachine-room perfectly light and plentifully ventilated. Under such\r\nconditions, dirt cannot accumulate unseen, and the general tone of the work\r\nis raised.\r\n\r\nTHE FLOOR.--The floor should be of thick concrete, and have a good surface\r\nlayer of cement. Preparations are now advertised for which claims are made\r\nthat their employment renders the surface of such floors waterproof and\r\ndustproof. If these claims can be substantiated when the use is applied to\r\nthe floors of rubber factories, the employment of a preparation of this\r\nnature should result in a considerable saving of expense and trouble.\r\nPreferably the floor should not be flat, but should slope slightly from the\r\nlongitudinal middle of the building to the sides on either hand. If the\r\nfloor is level it usually results in accumulation of water, the cement\r\nbreaks in patches, and the factory always appears to be dirty.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF MACHINES.--All machines should be arranged adjacent to and\r\nparallel with one of the long sides of the building, and should be raised\r\nabout 6 inches above the floor, so that water may escape easily. Tanks for\r\nthe reception of latex, scrap rubber, etc., should be placed along the\r\nopposite wall to the machines, and the intermediate length of the building\r\nshould be entirely free from fixtures. It was not uncommon in older\r\nfactories to find the engine situated in the middle of the floor, so that\r\nwhat with the space occupied by the engine, and the space rendered\r\nunavailable by the belt-drive, the real accommodation of the factory was\r\nsadly diminished. In no modern factory should the engines be brought into\r\nthe main room. They should always be accommodated in a special compartment,\r\nsituated outside the wall, along the inside of which machines are placed.\r\nIn this way considerable floor space is left available, and the machines\r\nmay be worked by direct drive. Not only so; but if a suction-gas plant is\r\nworked, there can then be no excuse for particles of coal or charcoal dust\r\nbeing found in the factory.\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF ENGINES.--It scarcely need be pointed out that if the engines\r\nare placed outside the wall which is opposite the machines, a long\r\nbelt-drive would be necessitated, and that the presence of the belt would\r\nprevent the use of end doors. It is presumed in these arguments that two\r\nengines are to be installed. One can hardly imagine a modern factory in\r\nfull working being equipped with only one engine, which might possibly have\r\nan excess of power necessary to drive all the machines. In the case of\r\nbreakdown, which sometimes happens in the best supervised factories, it\r\nwould be small consolation to know that this excess of power was present\r\ntheoretically.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY STOREYS.--There can be no doubt that, taking all things into\r\nconsideration, the best type of factory is that consisting only of one\r\nfloor. The factory should be quite separate from all other buildings, and\r\nif attempts are made to conserve ground space by putting a drying-room over\r\nthe factory, much trouble will ensue, especially if pale crepes are to be\r\nmade. In the first place, the factory is made very much darker, and hence\r\nmore difficult to keep clean; secondly, the ventilation of the factory is\r\nseriously interfered with; and thirdly, it is manifestly prejudicing the\r\ndrying of rubber to place it directly over a room which is always more or\r\nless awash with water. At night such a building would reek with a\r\nmoisture-laden atmosphere, and little drying could be expected to take\r\nplace in that interval. From actual experience it has been shown that\r\nrubber hung to dry in such a room, situated over a damp factory, is very\r\nliable to attacks of \"spot\" diseases, since the presence of perpetual\r\nmoisture is favourable to the development of these diseases. If a\r\ndouble-storey building has to be worked, it will be readily seen that no\r\nfirst-grade rubber should be allowed to dry in it. The accommodation over\r\nthe factory may be restricted to the purpose of receiving lower grade\r\nrubber which is not so liable to \"spot\" diseases, and possibly does not\r\ntake so long to dry as first-grade rubbers of equal thickness. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the erection of double-storey factories is false\r\neconomy, as separate drying-houses have to be built eventually. This\r\nconclusion does not apply with the same force to factories worked in\r\nconjunction with smoke-houses for preparing sheet rubber, but,\r\nnevertheless, such a factory should not have another floor above the\r\nwork-room.\r\n\r\nVERANDAHS.--One of the worst features in many factories is the necessity\r\nfor coolies to bring latex into the factory. As already mentioned, the\r\nfloors of factories are usually running with water (or should be), and it\r\ncan be imagined that the passage to and fro of scores of coolies must bring\r\nin a great quantity of dirt. Not only so; the very presence of the coolies\r\nis a hindrance to the efficient working of the factory, and considerable\r\nfloor-space and time are wasted.\r\n\r\nThis feature in factory working is all the more annoying because the\r\nnecessity for it could so easily be obviated. All that is necessary is the\r\nerection of a wide, open verandah outside the wall of the factory. Here all\r\nlatex could be received and strained, scrap-rubbers could be received and\r\npassed through an opening into tanks placed in convenient position. Water\r\ncould be laid on in this verandah so that coolies might wash their buckets,\r\nand the whole verandah might be enclosed only with expanded metal so as to\r\navoid interference with the lighting of the factory. In this way it would\r\nbe quite unnecessary for any field coolie to enter the factory proper, and\r\nthis would facilitate cleanliness. Such an arrangement has been discussed\r\nby the writers many times during the last few years, but the number of\r\nestates which have made such provision is still in the minority, and the\r\nsame slipshod and dirt-making procession of coolies continues to walk\r\nthrough the factories, and the same piles of bark-shavings and scrap-rubber\r\ncontinue to accumulate and ferment in a few instances.\r\n\r\nAn indication of types of verandahs is given in Chapters VII. and IX. These\r\nare not intended to be representative of a universal design, but may be\r\nsuggestive in the planning of others according to local conditions.\r\n\r\nSITUATION OF TANKS.--It will be noted that these verandahs are raised from\r\nthe ground-level to a height of about 3 feet in order that latex may be\r\ngravitated, with a slight fall, into the coagulating tanks which are within\r\nthe factory. There exists a real necessity for this practice, inasmuch as\r\notherwise to obtain gravitation of latex (which is quicker and cheaper\r\nthan handling) the coagulating tanks would have to be either placed on the\r\nfloor or sunk beneath the level. The risk of contamination of latex or\r\ncoagulum under such circumstances would be appreciable. Apart from this, it\r\nis advisable to have the coagulating tanks raised to a height of between 2\r\nand 3 feet, to secure the advantage of ease of working in the processes of\r\ncoagulation and the handling of coagulum--a not inconsiderable factor.\r\n\r\nIn some modern designs it is proposed to place the coagulating tanks in a\r\nseparate building. This would seem to be an unnecessary refinement in a new\r\nbuilding, if observance is given to the suggestions made in previous\r\nparagraphs.\r\n\r\nDESIGNS AND \"LAY-OUT.\"--In a previous publication[17] comment was made upon\r\ngrievous errors in designs prepared by those inexperienced in the\r\nrequirements of the tropics. There is little ground now for complaint, and\r\nlocal engineering firms are fully capable of advising upon, and\r\nconstructing, suitable buildings.\r\n\r\n[17] \"Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" Morgan, 1913.\r\n\r\nIn considering the first installation of a factory and equipment one always\r\nhas to weigh the question of prime cost against the probability of future\r\nexpansion of crop. If it should be decided at first merely to cater for\r\ncontemporary requirements, the fullest consideration should be given in\r\ndiscussing design of building and lay-out of machinery to the\r\npracticability of later extension. The site should be large enough for the\r\neventual group of buildings, the building should be easily capable of\r\nextension with the least cost, and the same forethought should govern the\r\nlay-out of the machinery.\r\n\r\nDRAINS.--Lastly, there is the question of drains. Generally speaking, all\r\nfactories are well provided with drains, and the only difficulty is that of\r\ngetting an adequate fall for efficient drainage. But there is a certain\r\namount of laxity exhibited in the matter of providing sieves in drains. To\r\nanyone acquainted with factory working, it must be apparent that quite a\r\nlot of small pieces of rubber are washed into the drains. This rubber\r\nshould be collected at intervals during the day; but in many instances\r\nthat collected is only a fraction of what escapes. Wherever possible the\r\ndrainings of a factory should be carried as far as is practicable from the\r\nbuildings by means of cement drains. Too often these are short, and lead\r\ninto earthen drains. Even if no pieces of rubber are present, the serum\r\nfrom the coagulum is subject to decomposition, the effluvium from which is\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nWATER SUPPLY.--It is essential that a good supply of water should be\r\navailable. This should be distributed by pipes all round the building, so\r\nthat a hose may be used in every part for the thorough cleansing of the\r\nfactory at intervals during the hours of working.\r\n\r\nSumming up, it might be said that a good factory, therefore, should have\r\nthe following features:\r\n\r\n     1. Plenty of windows, or walls of expanded metal.\r\n\r\n     2. A jack-roof in the ridge, and hence a good system of ventilation.\r\n\r\n     3. Engines in compartments outside the walls of the factory.\r\n\r\n     4. Machines close to and parallel with the wall outside of which the\r\n     engines are placed.\r\n\r\n     5. Latex tanks and other fixtures along the wall opposite the\r\n     machines.\r\n\r\n     6. A long middle free space, at either end of which a large double\r\n     door should be placed in the end walls.\r\n\r\n     7. A good concrete and cement floor sloping slightly from the middle\r\n     towards each long wall.\r\n\r\n     8. An abundant water supply, and several lengths of hose.\r\n\r\n     9. The building should be of only one floor, and have ample head room.\r\n\r\n     10. There should be an outside, open verandah upon which latex may be\r\n     received, etc.; preferably outside the wall which is opposite to the\r\n     machines.\r\n\r\n     11. The system of drainage should be thorough, and the drains should\r\n     be adequately screened, so that all particles of rubber may be\r\n     collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_OTHER BUILDINGS_\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYING-HOUSES FOR CREPE.--It has already been shown in the previous chapter\r\nthat one type of drying-houses--viz., that over a factory--stands\r\ncondemned, except for the drying of low-grade rubbers. Generally speaking,\r\na great advance has been made in the design of crepe drying-houses during\r\nrecent years, and it has been possible even to improve older ones so as to\r\nbring them into line with the more modern buildings. Houses for drying\r\ncrepe rubber may be of one floor, two floors, or even three floors.\r\nDoubtless those built with three floors were designed with a view to\r\neconomising the available site for factory buildings, and as long as the\r\nventilation is good there can be no very great objection to them. It might\r\nbe pointed out, however, that even with the best of ventilation the air\r\npassing successively through three layers of rubber must be fairly\r\nsaturated with moisture by the time it leaves the building. The effect of\r\nthis upon the rate of drying in the uppermost chamber will not be so marked\r\nas it will be in the middle floor, as the temperature of the top floor must\r\nbe many degrees higher than that of the other two rooms. It would be\r\nexpected, therefore, that the rate of drying in the middle storey would be\r\nslower than that in either of the other two.\r\n\r\nIn houses of two floors this objection would not have to be met, and\r\ndrying-houses of this type are successful and common.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY STOREYS?--Again nothing could be urged against a building of two\r\nor three storeys in which the ground floor was occupied as a packing-room,\r\nexcept that, by negligence in not allowing wet crepe a preliminary dripping\r\nperiod, water might fall upon the packed rubber below.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of experience, such a house is, taking all into consideration,\r\nthe cheapest and most suitable type for any estate with an increase in\r\noutput. Even at the outset there should be a separate room in which sorting\r\nand packing is undertaken. This is conveniently the lower room of a\r\ndrying-house. The only stipulation to be made for a house with two storeys\r\nis that the floor of the upper room should be of an open pattern, so that\r\nthe air may circulate right through the building. This is usually and very\r\nsuccessfully attained by laying down wide slats of wood, with spaces of an\r\ninch or more between them. It is not advisable to have spaces wider than\r\n1-1/2 inches, otherwise there is a certain amount of danger to the limbs of\r\nindividuals who have to work or supervise in the building. In any case, it\r\nis very convenient to have pathways of planks running the whole length of\r\nthe floor, so that the supervision is made more convenient. If this is\r\ndone, there can be no objection to the custom of suspending the rubber of a\r\nlower chamber from the slats of the floor of the upper room. At present, in\r\nsome drying-houses, this means of suspension is used, but no planks are\r\nlaid down, and it becomes necessary to walk over the drying rubber. This is\r\na detail, but it is one which does not make for the improvement of rubber,\r\nand the expenditure of a small sum would be sufficient to rectify the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view, it would be desirable to have the floor of the\r\npacking-shed (or the packing-room in a combined house) raised from the\r\nground, to a height of, say, 3 feet; or the height of a bullock-cart or\r\nmotor-lorry. Not only is ventilation improved, but there would be a great\r\nsaving in labour. Packed cases could be wheeled directly on a level with\r\nthe cart or lorry.\r\n\r\nA great many estates favour drying-houses of one storey. These are\r\neminently suitable, provided that the site is suitable, and that the\r\nrelative dimensions of the house are favourable to efficient ventilation.\r\nIt is a common mistake to find buildings of which the breadth is out of\r\nproportion to the height. Obviously, if the height is not considerably in\r\nexcess of the breadth, ventilation will be defective. For a single-storey\r\ndrying-house, the maximum height should bear the ratio to the breadth of\r\n3:2, and in a house of this type specially long pieces of crepe can be\r\nutilised. Naturally, in a house of two storeys, this factor is not likely\r\nto be neglected, and if the lower room is used for packing purposes the\r\nrate of drying should be rapid. Again, when a single-storey building is\r\ncontemplated, it is well to make strict examination of local conditions. If\r\nthe site is low-lying and surrounded by trees it will be clear that tall\r\nbuildings are required, and that a house of more than one floor is to be\r\npreferred. Considerations of this nature would have prevented the erection\r\nof some dry-sheds which do not give a satisfactory rate of drying.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION.--No matter how many floors there may be in a drying-house, the\r\ngreatest attention should be given to the question of ventilation. It is an\r\nelementary point in the study of ventilation problems that the best system\r\nof natural ventilation is obtained by admitting cool air near or through\r\nthe floor and providing an exit for the warmer air at the highest point in\r\nthe building. It is not often that such a rule is infringed in the\r\nventilation of rubber drying-houses, but several of the older buildings\r\nerred in this respect. In a good modern house there is a space (about 2\r\nfeet in height) all round the base of the walls merely closed with expanded\r\nmetal; this admits cool air. An exit for warm air is provided in the ridge\r\nof the roof by either ventilation chimneys or by a jack-roof. The latter is\r\npreferable, as it provides for a more free and uniform escape.\r\n\r\nIn some drying-houses, besides the ridge openings, the space along the\r\neaves is left open. This would seem to be undesirable, as it provides for\r\nthe entrance of outer air, which might combat the ascending warm air and so\r\ninterfere with the natural upward currents. Provided that a jack-roof or\r\nother suitable openings have been installed, there is, therefore, no\r\nnecessity for the existence of open spaces at the eaves, and they probably\r\ndo more harm than good.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, on days of sunshine, there must always be an upward current\r\nof air in well-designed houses. Temperatures of 105 deg. F. are easily recorded\r\nin the ridge space of a building, while the temperature in the lower part\r\nof the house may be at least 15 deg. F. lower. On the floor of an upper room a\r\ntemperature of 90 deg. F. is commonly noted, and in buildings with three\r\nstoreys the usual day temperature of the top room is about or over 100 deg. F.\r\nEven, therefore, when there is no trace of a breeze, there must be a\r\ndisplacement of air in an upward direction, though it may not be detected\r\nwithout tests being applied.\r\n\r\nIt is often asked whether a temperature of 100 deg. F., such as is obtained in\r\nthe upper room, is calculated to injure the quality of the rubber. There\r\nneed be no fear on this ground; the experience of many estates goes to show\r\nnot only that no harm results, but also that the drying of the rubber is\r\nexpedited. There would seem to be no reason why crepe rubber should not be\r\ndried at a temperature of 100 deg. F. It must be understood, however, that\r\nhigher temperatures for crepe rubber are not recommended, as it has been\r\nproved that the rubber is affected. The fact becomes obvious with continued\r\ntreatment at temperatures much above 100 deg. F., for the rubber stretches and\r\nbreaks across the support.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS.--Concerning the subject of window space in a drying-house, there\r\nhas been much discussion at various times. Years ago it was common to find\r\nwindows widely open with the sunshine streaming in. Naturally, tackiness\r\ndeveloped in some of the rubber, and care was then taken to keep the\r\nwindows closed. Thus the rooms were darkened and air excluded. There\r\nfollowed a period in which windows were fitted with ruby-coloured glass to\r\nkeep out the actinic rays of the sun, which were responsible for tackiness,\r\nand excess of light, which was supposed to be responsible for the rapid\r\noxidation of rubber. Unless special precautions were observed in the\r\nprocesses of coagulation and preparation, it was not proved that the\r\nexclusion of light prevented or lessened the natural oxidation of crepe\r\nrubber. Since the introduction of sodium bisulphite for the prevention of\r\noxidation, there has been no cause to worry as to the possible effect of\r\nlight, as no perceptible darkening of the rubber takes place. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that no trouble need be taken to exclude light, although the\r\nnecessity for excluding direct sunshine still exists. Windows may be left\r\nopen as long as the sun does not reach them. This can usually be arranged\r\nin a drying-house by manipulating the windows at intervals during the day,\r\nso that those in the shady side of a building are always open, while those\r\non the sunny side are always closed. If it is thought that this\r\nmanipulation cannot be entrusted with success to the store coolies, the\r\ncase may be met by having all windows constructed on the louvre pattern, so\r\nthat, although the windows are closed all day, air and light are not\r\nexcluded. Should it be desired to retain the existing type of windows,\r\nwhich open outwards, and to keep them open all day, a simple arrangement of\r\nruby-coloured cloth on an outstanding wooden frame may be placed within the\r\nwalls of the building, or the shutters of the windows may be hinged at the\r\ntop to open outwards. Unless there is a pronounced breeze, or it is\r\nrequired to examine the rubber closely, there is no necessity to have\r\nwindows open, except in the case of a house in which the bottom floor is\r\nused as a packing-room. The windows of this chamber may remain open during\r\nthe day, to advantage in sorting and packing, and also to the proper\r\nventilation of the building. Thus the direct rays of the sun are rendered\r\nharmless, while air and light are allowed to enter.\r\n\r\nHOT-AIR DRYING-HOUSES.--Mention has already been made of the existence of a\r\nsystem of drying in which hot air is forced into a drying-house by means of\r\na powerful fan. Provided that the temperature of the hot air could be so\r\nregulated as not to exceed 100 deg. F., there would be merit in the system.\r\nSuch matter of regulation could be solved by having a duct in the main air\r\npassage, through which cool air could be admitted in such proportion as to\r\nmodify the temperature of the hot air. As the process is worked at present,\r\nthe temperature attained is often well above 100 deg. F., and there is a danger\r\nof thin crepe placed in this house over-night being found upon the floor in\r\nthe morning. Unless the crepe is prepared thick and cut into fairly short\r\nlengths, it will not bear its own weight at higher temperatures; and if it\r\nis made thick, drying is impracticably prolonged. It is probable that, with\r\na temperature of 100 deg. F., and a steady current of air, average thin crepe\r\nwould dry in such a drying-house within six or seven days. This would be\r\nan improvement upon the usual rate of drying in most factories, although\r\nseveral ordinary drying-houses are known in which thin crepe will dry\r\nnaturally in that period.\r\n\r\nSMOKE-HOUSES.--No discussion of theoretical considerations regarding the\r\nprocess of smoke-curing will be attempted here. We are concerned only with\r\nthe necessity for supplying a demand for smoke-cured sheet rubber. Broadly,\r\nthe process is akin to the smoke-curing of herrings, and the objects are\r\nmuch the same--viz., (1) drying, (2) preservation--except that while\r\nherrings are only dried partially, rubber should be dried perfectly.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale a primitive smoke-house could be built easily and cheaply,\r\nand such a building might be fully as efficacious as the most elaborate and\r\nexpensive installation. In the early days of estates it was not uncommon to\r\nsee temporary smoke-houses constructed of wood, and roofed with \"attaps\"\r\n(palm leaves). Some of the best rubber in the market has come from wooden\r\nbuildings, but naturally the risk of destruction by fire is considerable.\r\n\r\nFor imperative reasons it may be sometimes found necessary to smoke rubber\r\nwhen the only available building is a single-storey one. As a temporary\r\nmeasure, the building may be converted into a smoke-house by placing the\r\nfires in pits sunk deeply into the ground, and effectively screened above\r\nby iron baffle plates. But it is not advisable that smoking be continued in\r\nsuch a single-storey building, as the best effects are not obtained, and\r\nthe risk of fire is far too great.\r\n\r\nUSUAL TYPES.--At first sight it would appear that the best type of\r\nsmoke-house would be one consisting of a tall building, covering a\r\ncomparatively small superficial area, and having a number of superimposed\r\nchambers in which the rubber could be hung to dry. In practice there are\r\nseveral solid objections which limit the height and the number of floors.\r\nChief among these is the question of temperature. If smoke-curing is to be\r\neffective, a certain temperature must be attained and maintained. To obtain\r\nsuch results in a house of excessive height would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, under normal conditions. It would be found that the chamber\r\nimmediately above the furnace-room would be overheated if the temperature\r\nin the upper rooms was within the desired range, etc.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years smoke-houses could be classed as belonging to one of two\r\ntypes:\r\n\r\n     (1) Those having external furnaces.\r\n\r\n     (2) Those having internal furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe number of the former existing at the present time must be very small,\r\nas it has been shown that the arrangement of the furnace outside the house\r\nis unsatisfactory in comparison with the other type of house. In discussing\r\nthe question of smoke-houses, therefore, it will be understood that the\r\nstandard type accepted is that having an internal furnace. In its original\r\nform it was known as a \"Kent\" drier, and consisted of a tall two-storey\r\nwooden building. The walls of the lower chamber had the form of an inverted\r\nand truncated pyramid. By this arrangement it was possible to obtain from a\r\ncomparatively small fire sufficient smoke and heat to cure the product\r\nplaced in the room above. This is the principle upon which many\r\nsmoke-houses in Malaya are designed. On a very large scale it is not\r\nclaimed that the sloping sides of the lower chamber lead to economy in the\r\nnumber of fires, but merely divert the smoke in an upward direction. It is\r\nacknowledged that vertical lower walls are quite effective, and it is an\r\neasier matter to fit in doors.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that the usual type of smoke-house now in general use\r\nconsists of a building of two storeys, in the lower of which are situated\r\nthe furnaces, while rubber is hung on racks in the upper room. Sometimes\r\nthere may be a third storey, also used as a drying (curing) chamber. As a\r\nrule the drying-room is one long unit, as also is the furnace chamber; but\r\nin some cases they are subdivided by vertical partitions into smaller\r\nchambers, for ease of working and better control. This applies with some\r\nforce in the case of very long houses standing in an open space. It is\r\nsometimes found in such cases that at certain seasons the prevailing winds\r\nhave the effect of making drying and curing uneven in parts of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions, the ordinary type of smoke-house functions very\r\nefficiently, and is capable of drying average sheet (from standardised\r\nlatex) in a period ranging from seven to eleven days. Should the building\r\nnot be capable of such performance, in spite of the strict observance of\r\nall rules laid down for the processes of preparation, then there is some\r\ndefect in ventilation or in the distribution of heat.\r\n\r\nGENERAL VENTILATION.--The ordinary rules of ventilation in drying-houses\r\napply equally to a smoke-house. There should be a slow current of air and\r\nsmoke from the lowest point to the highest point in the building.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that has been written on this subject, it is by no means\r\nuncommon to encounter the idea that a smoke-house should be perfectly\r\nclosed in order to get good results. As to what must become of the (say) 25\r\nper cent. of moisture which the rubber contains there is no knowledge. In\r\ndozens of cases, when complaints regarding slowness of drying have been\r\ninvestigated, it has been necessary to point out the need for providing a\r\nrational system of ventilation.\r\n\r\nNaturally only a slow current of air and smoke is required. The creation of\r\nan appreciable draught would have the effect of increasing the fuel\r\nconsumption of the furnaces, raising dust from the ash, and of causing a\r\ntemperature higher than that which is known to be desirable. It will be\r\nclear, therefore, that if there are to be any openings at the base of the\r\nwalls they should be small in area, and should have some device by means of\r\nwhich the current of air can be efficiently regulated. In the usual case\r\nthe construction of the building is not calculated to render it air-tight,\r\nand the necessity for providing special air inlets does not arise.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS.--Windows are not strictly necessary, and are only intended to be\r\nof service during the time in which coolies are at work within the\r\nbuilding. The operations of examining rubber, turning sheets, removing dry\r\nrubber, cleaning racks and floors, and putting wet rubber into position,\r\nusually occupy some hours daily. During this interval the windows should be\r\nwidely opened if the weather is favourable, and should remain so until the\r\nfires have been lighted. It should not be forgotten that during the heat\r\nof the day quite an appreciable degree of drying is possible. Advantage can\r\nbe taken of this; but there is no necessity to extend the interval unduly,\r\nand it is of greater advantage to proceed with smoke-curing when the work\r\nin the drying-chambers has ceased.\r\n\r\nRACKS OF SUPPORTS.--Still referring to the usual type of smoke-house, it\r\nmay be remarked that in the upper room bays of racks run at right angles to\r\na central passage down the length of the building. Narrower passages run\r\nbetween the bays of the racks to facilitate ease in handling and\r\ninspection. The wooden supports may be placed about 3 inches apart\r\nhorizontally, and 15 or 18 inches apart vertically. A full bay of racks\r\nshould contain nine or more lines of support in each of the planes which\r\nare 15 or 18 inches apart vertically. The number of these planes is\r\ngoverned only by the height of the room, measured from the floor to eaves.\r\nThe supports should be of smooth timber, and need not exceed 1-1/2 inches\r\nsquare in section.\r\n\r\nIt is usual and advisable to smooth off the rectangular edges of the\r\nsupports or bars, to avoid the incidence of splinters of wood adhering to\r\nthe rubber. The bars should not be fixtures, but may either be accommodated\r\nin slots, or may rest _between_ two nails, so that it is possible to give\r\nthem a rotary motion by turning the projecting ends. This practice is\r\nfollowed in smoke-houses, the idea being to move the drying sheets slightly\r\neach day, with a view to the prevention of a pronounced mark across the\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to see that the vacant racks are thoroughly cleaned\r\nbefore fresh rubber is placed upon them, otherwise a distinct dirty mark is\r\ncaused across the middle of the sheet. This mark usually cannot be removed,\r\neven by scrubbing with water. Where this mark occurs regularly in all\r\nsheets, attention should be turned to the openings beneath the bays of\r\nracks, if open fire furnaces are employed. It will generally be found that\r\ngauze of too wide mesh has been fitted. This should be removed or covered\r\nwith a finer gauze.\r\n\r\nA more effective way of dealing with the trouble, provided other\r\nprecautions have been taken, is to have plenty of spare wooden bars. It\r\nshould be a rule stringently enforced that, as soon as racks are emptied,\r\nthe bars should be removed to the factory to be cleansed thoroughly. A\r\nspare set should enter the smoke-house with each batch of fresh rubber. The\r\nactual number of spare sets required could be limited to a two days'\r\nsupply, and the extra cost would be recouped easily.\r\n\r\nFLOOR OF DRYING-CHAMBER.--The floor of the chamber is usually of planks,\r\nexcept that the space under each bay of racks should be filled with\r\nexpanded metal. With the use of wood fires there is always a large amount\r\nof light ash formed, which may find its way into the upper chamber. To\r\ncounteract this, screens of fine mesh gauze are laid over the expanded\r\nmetal. This gauze may be fitted into a movable wooden frame, so that when\r\nit becomes necessary to clean it the whole may be removed.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that with furnaces of the \"open-fire\" type the rise of\r\ndust is so great that the gauze screens soon become clogged, especially as\r\nthe slight tarry matter in the smoke condenses on the gauze, causing the\r\ndust to adhere. With the better types of furnaces, the employment of gauze\r\nscreens is not necessary, as there should be very little rise of dust. It\r\nis sufficient to use only expanded metal, to prevent any displaced pieces\r\nof rubber falling into the furnace chamber.\r\n\r\nFURNACES GENERALLY.--The crudest and dirtiest method of fuel consumption in\r\nthe preparation of smoked-sheet rubber is that of making a fire on the\r\nground. This is still a common practice, and should be condemned as being\r\nboth wasteful and harmful. Under prevailing conditions coolies will, in\r\nspite of instructions, heap up a pile of logs in order to save themselves\r\nthe trouble of stoking the fire in small quantity and at regular intervals.\r\nA small supply of water is kept at hand with which to quench the fire\r\nsomewhat if it threatens to cause trouble. Naturally a large quantity of\r\nfine ash is thus thrown up, and the rubber above receives the deposit. If\r\nthe coolie does not happen to be sufficiently awake, of course a house\r\nburns occasionally.\r\n\r\nFrom this primitive type of furnace, others have been evolved. These\r\nusually take the form of more or less shallow trucks, the majority of\r\nwhich are similar in principle to the fire on the ground, except that the\r\ncontainer can be withdrawn from the house for the purpose of removing the\r\nash. Sometimes they are even more objectionable than the ground fire,\r\ninasmuch as, being raised above the ground level, an under-draught through\r\nfire-bars is caused, and consumption of fuel is so much the more rapid.\r\n\r\nPITS.--It is clear that large fires are not desirable, and that combustion\r\nshould be slow, provided that the necessary temperature can be maintained.\r\nThe lines along which the development of furnaces needed to extend are\r\ntherefore plain. The simplest device adopted was the digging of pits in the\r\nground. Sometimes these pits received the addition of an iron truncated\r\ncone which was movable. Naturally the combustion was slow, but sufficient\r\nheat was obtained if the pits were large enough or in sufficient number. An\r\nobjection was that the ash had to be cleared _in situ_, and in the process\r\nthe earthen pits gradually increased in size. In all cases it was necessary\r\nto suspend an iron baffle-plate above the furnaces to distribute smoke and\r\narrest any sparks.\r\n\r\n\"POT\" FURNACES.--The next development was the employment of \"pot-furnaces.\"\r\nThese consist of iron drums, sometimes merely resting on the ground, and\r\nsometimes mounted on trucks for easy withdrawal. These drums radiate\r\nsufficient heat if present in sufficient numbers, and the fuel consumption\r\nis low. They are usually manipulated by starting a fire in the bottom and\r\npacking in logs cut to the necessary length. Some have no lids, while\r\nothers are fitted with perforated caps.\r\n\r\nIt was considered necessary in some instances to punch a few small holes\r\nnear the base of the drum in order to ensure a very slight upward draught.\r\nIn a few cases this perforation has been exaggerated to the form of a\r\nhinged door. Unless this can be closed with ease, and is closed according\r\nto instructions, part of the object of this type of furnace is defeated;\r\nfuel consumption is rapid, and the temperature is too high. In the original\r\nform \"pot-furnaces\" have been found to be effective on many estates, and\r\nare still employed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIRON STOVES.--Working on exactly the same principle, on some estates one\r\nfinds small iron stoves in use. Sometimes broad pipes are attached for the\r\nbetter distribution of the smoke; if this is the case it should be noted\r\nthat the pipes should have a slight downward slope, and that the \"bend\" at\r\nthe end should be turned downwards. In this way condensed moisture and\r\ncreosotic matter falls to the ground, and does not lodge in the pipe. The\r\nlife of the conduit is thus prolonged. Usually such stoves are in use where\r\nthe \"head-room\" of a smoking chamber is insufficient for other types, or\r\nwhere the nature of the site does not permit of sunken furnaces being\r\ninstalled. They are of value likewise on occasions where the fuel supply is\r\nlimited to a rich timber such as mangrove-logs (\"bakau\"), when it is\r\nnecessary to ensure a low combustion with low cost of fuel.\r\n\r\nHORIZONTAL DRUM-FURNACES.--To overcome difficulties inherent to drums or\r\n\"pot-furnaces,\" the next development was that in which the drum was made to\r\nassume a horizontal position, and adapted ingeniously to a simple system of\r\nworking from the outside of the building. Reference to the drawings given\r\nwill explain how this is effected. In the first illustration (No. 2) it\r\nwill be noted that the drum is supported upon brick pillars, with one end\r\nprojecting through the wall of the building. At the other end a short\r\nchimney is mounted, having within it a \"damper\" which is adjustable from\r\nthe outside. Over this chimney is suspended a simple baffle-plate, made\r\nfrom a Chinese iron cooking-pan. The outer end of the drum is furnished\r\nwith a hinged and latched door, in which a small air-regulator is\r\naccommodated.\r\n\r\nIn the second set of drawings (No. 1) the drum is increased in size and\r\nfitted in a special manner for incorporation with a distinct type of\r\nbuilding. Such a scheme was first put into effect by Mr. R. C. Sherar, the\r\nmanager of Third Mile Estate, Seremban, F.M.S., and for ease of reference\r\nthe house and furnace will hereafter be mentioned when necessary as the\r\n\"Third Mile\" type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIRD MILE\" TYPE; HORIZONTAL DRUM.\r\n\r\nThis type of furnace is suitable for adapting to existing buildings with\r\nperpendicular lower walls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIRD MILE\" TYPE OF FURNACE, USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH\r\n\"THIRD MILE\" SMOKE-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the furnace has at the farther end a door for the\r\nremoval of ash. As this, if badly fitting, may result in too great a\r\ndraught, it is well to insist upon good workmanship. Other adjustable\r\nair-inlets are provided, and the drum is enclosed in a brick chamber.\r\n\r\nRATE OF COMBUSTION.--However successful this furnace may have proved in the\r\nhands of trained coolies, one must feel that with such a number of\r\nair-inlets (whether accidental or designed) there would always be present\r\nthe possibility of obtaining too rapid a combustion. In the original forms\r\nof drums or pot-furnaces of various kinds, a very slow rate of combustion\r\nwas attained. Naturally a relatively larger proportion of carbon remained\r\nunconsumed, and there was a small proportion of ash. In these respects the\r\nfurnaces resembled charcoal-burners. In point of fact, some estates used\r\nthis principle for the dual purpose of smoke-curing the rubber, and at the\r\nsame time obtaining a supply of charcoal to provide fuel for their\r\nsuction-gas engines. This is a consideration in times when managers are\r\ndesirous of discovering any devices which tend towards reduction of costs.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that, under ordinary circumstances, the condition of what\r\nremains after the combustion of the fuel gives an indication of the rate at\r\nwhich the wood has burned, and this test should apply to all furnaces. That\r\nin which there is the most ash and the least charcoal is the one least to\r\nbe desired. In direct connection with this consideration, one must\r\nrecognise that a fire which is sunk below the level of the ground exposes\r\nthe least surface from which heat may radiate; and hence, in order to\r\nobtain the maximum benefit of heat from a slow-combustion furnace, it\r\nshould be above ground-level, or should have a superstructure from which\r\nthe heat may be dissipated.\r\n\r\nSimple drum furnaces, with slow combustion, have the further advantages\r\nthat a \"charge\" of fuel will need no attention for possibly eight to ten\r\nhours, and practically no ash is found to be ejected. These advantages have\r\ngreat practical importance. The first minimises any disabilities arising\r\nfrom neglect on the part of coolies, and the second makes for increased\r\ncleanliness in the drying-chamber. While these advantages would appeal to\r\nmost estates, there would appear to be a further advantage to small\r\nestates which have only temporary timber smoke-houses. With a slow rate of\r\ncombustion in a furnace of this type, danger from fire is diminished\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the slow rate of combustion, and hence the comparatively\r\nlow temperature obtained, it will be plain that drum furnaces should be\r\nemployed in larger number than ordinary open-hearth fires; and the drums\r\ncan be so placed as to ensure the best possible uniform distribution of\r\nheat and smoke.\r\n\r\nLarge furnaces are sometimes seen, with flues of brickwork. In view of the\r\nforegoing remarks, it will be obvious that these tend to large fires and a\r\nrapid combustion, and hence must be classed as undesirable.\r\n\r\nBRICK STOVES.--Developing from \"drum\" furnaces, another type comes into\r\nexistence. In principle it consists of an enclosed brick furnace, with\r\nfeeding door, and a low conical dome surmounted by an adjustable cap or\r\nspark-arrester. The rate of combustion can be influenced by a suitable\r\nmovement of the cap, which is operated by a screw. This type of furnace has\r\nbeen installed on several estates by the engineering department of Messrs.\r\nHarrisons and Crosfield, and is understood to give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nPATALING TYPE.--With the exception of the \"Third Mile\" type already\r\nmentioned, all the furnaces described are open to a strong objection, in\r\nthat the coolies have to enter a room, usually filled with hot smoke, in\r\norder to attend to the fires. The mere opening of the door of the building\r\nis sufficient to fan most fires into a blaze and to raise sparks. Apart\r\nfrom these points, it is natural for coolies to avoid entering too often,\r\nwith the result that they generally stoke with the maximum load of timber.\r\nEven should they not sleep the danger is clearly great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE SECTIONAL ELEVATION (PATALING TYPE OF FURNACE).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATALING TYPE OF FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nTo obviate these drawbacks, furnaces which are fed from the outside of the\r\nbuilding were designed. There have been various forms, but as they were\r\nfirst installed on Pataling Estate, in the present form, they may be known\r\nunder the description of the Pataling type of furnace. They are eminently\r\nsatisfactory, and have a low rate of fuel consumption. They are very\r\nsafe, and in fact, if worked with average intelligence in supervision, can\r\nbe regarded as being fool-proof. There is practically no ejection of fine\r\nash, and no fine-mesh screens need be employed. They can be adapted to any\r\nbuilding having either vertical or sloping walls of galvanised iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE SMOKE-HOUSE OF ORDINARY CONSTRUCTION, WITH SHIELDED\r\nVENTILATORS PERMANENTLY OPEN.\r\n\r\nIn foreground, movable folding racks on which sheets \"drip\" in the open\r\nair. This smoke-house is equipped with brick furnaces fed from the outside\r\n(Pataling Estate).]\r\n\r\nIn essential the furnace consists of a shallow pit below ground-level,\r\nlined with brick, and having a square brick superstructure rising 4 feet\r\nabove the floor of the building. On top of the brick walls rests a sheet of\r\nboiler-plate perforated with small holes. The hearth being below\r\nground-level, and with the extra 4 feet of height above the floor, it\r\nfollows that if ash is disturbed it is confined.\r\n\r\nFrom the drawings it may be seen that the pit is prolonged to the side wall\r\nof the building, with steps leading up to the ground-level. The top and\r\nsides of the opening are made with galvanised sheeting, forming a kind of\r\nshort tunnel in which the coolie may stand upright. The outer face of the\r\nbrick furnace forms the inner end of the tunnel, and accommodates the door\r\nof the furnace. The bottom of the pit is filled up with clay and stones\r\nalmost to the level of the bottom of the door. This ensures a very shallow\r\nhearth, and guards against an unduly large fire. Obviously it is not\r\ndesirable or necessary to make the hearth of fire-bars, as was done in one\r\ninstance, with the provision of a door below for removing the ash. This\r\nwould lead only to a strong draught being created, with a high rate of fuel\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRICK AND CEMENT SUPERSTRUCTURE OF FURNACE INSIDE THE\r\nBUILDING, BUT FED FROM OUTSIDE.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the superstructure rests a sheet of perforated boiler-plate.\r\nThe actual fire-pit is below ground-level, and to the left may be seen\r\nparts of the sides and top of the downward approach, from the outside, to\r\nthe door of the fire-pit.]\r\n\r\nThe openings can be screened by a narrow sloping lean-to, which serves to\r\nkeep out rain, and provides shelter for the stock of fuel and the coolie.\r\nThe iron furnace-door should be well made, with an easily worked latch; but\r\nit is not necessary that it should be perfectly fitting. Any slight\r\naperture will serve to provide the necessary air-inlet, but in any case it\r\nshould not be more than slight.\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION OF FUEL.--Regarding this furnace, it may be said in conclusion\r\nthat it is more satisfactory in general working than any other furnaces yet\r\nencountered. Obtaining information from over sixty estates, on the question\r\nof fuel consumption compared with output of rubber, it was found that, as\r\nfar as ordinary smoke-houses were concerned, the Pataling type of furnace\r\nshowed the lowest unit consumption of fuel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF SHELTERS COVERING APPROACHES TO FURNACES.]\r\n\r\nThis was at the rate of slightly less than 1 lb of fuel per 1 lb of\r\nthoroughly cured sheet rubber. The figure on some estates mounted as high\r\nas 4-1/2 lbs. of fuel per lb. of rubber. Naturally this factor may have\r\nbeen affected by failure to utilise the drying space to its fullest\r\ncapacity, but in the main the high rate of consumption could be attributed\r\nsolely to the deficiencies of the furnaces.\r\n\r\nFLOOR OF FURNACE-ROOM.--As a rule no attempt is made to improve the natural\r\nearthen floor. Whether open-hearth fires, truck furnaces, or drums are\r\nemployed, it is usual to find a floor with an inch or two of dust upon it.\r\nWhere all endeavours are directed in other directions towards cleanliness,\r\nit appears strange that this should be overlooked. In contrast, houses\r\nemploying the Pataling type of furnace (or others) have concrete and cement\r\nfloors, which can be kept quite clean. Cleanliness should be as zealously\r\nattempted in the smoke-house as in other departments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR VIEW OF SHELTER.\r\n\r\nSteps lead downwards where the wall of the smoke-house has been removed.]\r\n\r\nROOF.--In any type of smoke-house, the roof should fit tightly at the\r\neaves, and the only vent should be in or near the roof-ridge.\r\n\r\nIn an ordinary smoke-house, the opening should take the form either of a\r\nlow jack-roof or of squat chimneys protected against rain. If a jack-roof\r\nis chosen, it may be so low as to need no scheme of adjustment, or\r\notherwise adjustable swing shutters must be provided. The chimneys may be\r\nmade with such low fitting between the cap and the body that no interior\r\nswinging flaps are required.\r\n\r\nDuring the operation of smoke-curing the smoke vents must remain open to a\r\ndegree which is arrived at by experience. Failure to provide a\r\ncomparatively free egress for smoke and moisture will bring trouble in its\r\ntrain. After a house has been in use for some time, it will be noted that\r\nthe timber becomes covered with a shiny tarry coating deposited by the\r\nsmoke. If the rubber remained in the house for an equal period, it would\r\ntake on the same appearance. During the interval between the entry and the\r\nexit of the rubber some amount of deposit does take place, and it is this\r\nmixture of creosotic substances which plays a part in fitting the rubber to\r\nwithstand growths of mildew which would otherwise form.\r\n\r\nIf proper smoke-vents are not provided, the moisture evaporating from the\r\nsheets is unable to escape quickly enough, with the result that a great\r\ndeal condenses at night-time upon the inner surface of the comparatively\r\ncool roof, and falls back upon the rubber in unsightly black \"drips,\" which\r\nleave a distinct mark on the sheet. Even if vents are open, this may happen\r\nduring seasons of rain. The temperature of the moist smoke in the\r\nroof-ridge may be as high as 130 deg. to 140 deg. F., while the outer atmosphere\r\nmay have been cooled by rain to 70 deg. F. Such a difference on the two\r\nsurfaces of the roof must lead to condensation within the house, with\r\nconsequent \"dripping.\" It used to be the custom to drape sacking material\r\nabove the bays of racks in order to prevent the drops of liquid falling\r\nupon the rubber; but often for want of renewal the last state was worse\r\nthan the first. Modern houses have often an inner lining, a few inches\r\nbelow the roof. This is made of soft wood which receives any product of\r\ncondensation and absorbs it.\r\n\r\nOTHER TYPES OF SMOKE-HOUSE.--So far we have confined the arguments to\r\nsmoke-houses of the usual type. There are others which vary in either\r\ndesign and method of working, or in the material of the structure. Mention\r\nmay be made of the most prominent of these.\r\n\r\nBRICK HOUSES.--Some houses are constructed of brick, and may have one or\r\ntwo storeys above the furnace chamber. The floors are sometimes made of\r\nferro-concrete, and the furnaces may also be of this material. These brick\r\nhouses give satisfaction, but there would seem to be some difficulty in\r\nobtaining and maintaining the desired temperature, although it is not quite\r\nplain why this should be so. The principle of these buildings is the same\r\nas that of the ordinary iron house, and the suggestions made in previous\r\nparagraphs apply with equal force.\r\n\r\n\"THIRD MILE\" TYPE.--Reference has been made to the \"Third Mile\" type of\r\nfurnace. This is an integral part of a smoke-house, which for clearness of\r\ndistinction may be known as the \"Third Mile\" type of smoke-house, the\r\noriginal of which was erected on the Third Mile Estate, Seremban, F.M.S.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIRD MILE\" TYPE OF SMOKE-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nIn essence the design consists of a building, having two storeys for\r\nrubber-drying, and a shallow inverted pyramidal base, ending on the ground\r\nin \"Third Mile\" furnace, already described and illustrated.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the principles of ventilation employed are those\r\nindicated for an ordinary house--viz., air-inlet near the ground (with\r\nlittle draught), and smoke-vent at the roof-ridge. The windows shown in the\r\ndrawing are only for purposes of inspection of the rubber during the day,\r\nand form no part of the scheme of ventilation during the hours of smoking.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that the efficiency of the house is high. Certainly the work\r\nof attending to the furnaces is simplified, and there should be small\r\nground for excuse if negligence is displayed.\r\n\r\nJACKSON HOUSE.--This was brought into notice under the description of the\r\n\"Jackson Cabinet,\" and it was claimed that average sheets could be dried in\r\na few days. It consisted of a small house of one storey, having several\r\ntiers of racks. Smoke and heat were generated in a small stove placed\r\noutside the wall. A smoke vent was provided in the roof. These cabinets had\r\na certain vogue as part of a small unit installation, with a fair degree of\r\nsuccess. It is not clear, however, that such speed in drying is required.\r\n(This point will receive further attention in a subsequent chapter.)\r\n\r\n\"DEVON\" TYPE.--In its full original design this type owes its origin to Mr.\r\nH. E. Nixon, General Manager of the Devon Estates, Malacca, where it forms\r\npart of unit divisional installations worked under a scheme of\r\ndecentralisation.\r\n\r\nThe original units consisted of a building erected with an iron framework\r\ncovered with sheets of asbestos-slate, and a roof of galvanised iron.\r\n\r\nThe novelty in design lies in the utilisation of external platforms upon\r\nwhich the racks of bars supporting the sheets of rubber may be drawn out of\r\nthe smoking chambers, and on which the racks are loaded and unloaded. By\r\nthis device it is possible to remove the contents of any compartment bodily\r\nwithout interfering with the continuity of curing in the other\r\ncompartments. That is to say, smoking in such a house can proceed day and\r\nnight if necessary, and yet the rubber in any part of the house can be\r\nexamined, can be removed, or can be replaced without cessation of smoking.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the illustrations that the house is more or less of\r\nthe same general design as the \"Third Mile\" type, with the addition of\r\nexternal platforms. It has two storeys for the reception of rubber; and a\r\nbasal furnace-room with sloping sides converging downwards into a pit\r\ncontaining a large drum-furnace. This is mounted on a low truck, and\r\ntravels on a short length of railway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF DOUBLE \"DEVON\" TYPE OF SMOKE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe platforms are common to both units. Building of brick with iron roof\r\n(Batu Caves Estate).]\r\n\r\nEach of the curing-rooms is divided into four compartments (making eight\r\ncompartments in all). These are closed by swing doors, each of which is the\r\nfull width of a compartment, and has a slight overlapping edge. Through\r\nthese doors light railways run into the house and out upon the platforms.\r\nOn the rails \"bays\" of racks run, and when fully loaded they are easily\r\nmoved. The racks were designed with a frame of stout hard wood, but light\r\nangle-iron could be utilised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF DOUBLE \"DEVON\" SMOKE-HOUSE AND FACTORY\r\nBUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nTimber in foreground cut to length for stoking. Note water-tower and engine\r\ncooling-tanks adjacent to factory.]\r\n\r\nThe chimney style of smoke-vent has an internal butterfly flap, which is\r\ncontrolled by means of a wire from the outside. In the ordinary course of\r\nsmoke-curing, it is advised that this flap should be permanently open so as\r\nto reduce the possibility of internal condensation of moisture and\r\ncreosotic matter. The exact degree to which it should be open must be found\r\nby experience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF PLATFORM OF \"DEVON\" SMOKE-HOUSE; DOORS OF\r\nCOMPARTMENTS OPEN, AND ONE RACK PARTIALLY WITHDRAWN.\r\n\r\nNote below each rack opening through which smoke rises, covered with wire\r\nnetting.]\r\n\r\nAlthough reference has been made several times to compartments, it should\r\nbe understood that the chambers are not subdivided internally by means of\r\npartitions. There exists only the external effect of compartments in the\r\nform of the eight swinging doors which allow for the withdrawal of, or\r\ninsertion of, any one unit of racks at any time without interference with\r\nthe bulk of the rubber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE \"DEVON\" SMOKE-HOUSE OF BRICK, WITH ROOF OF CHINESE\r\nTILES, SHOWING LOADING PLATFORMS WITH RACKS WITHDRAWN FROM SMOKING\r\nCHAMBERS.\r\n\r\nFederated Engineering Co., Ltd., Kuala Lumpur.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE VIEW OF PRECEDING PHOTOGRAPH, SHOWING EXTERNAL\r\nARRANGEMENT FOR STOKING FURNACES.\r\n\r\nFederated Engineering Co., Ltd., Kuala Lumpur.]\r\n\r\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION.--As enquiries are often received it is permissible to\r\nreproduce the following detailed description of the original house. This\r\nappeared in the Fourth Local Report (Malaya) 1916, issued to subscribers by\r\nthe Rubber Growers' Association.\r\n\r\n     \"The house has a steel frame-work, 22 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 22\r\n     feet high. Of the length, 14 feet is occupied by the platforms, and 8\r\n     feet by the chambers. These measurements can be varied. The whole of\r\n     the width (16 feet) is occupied by compartments of which one series is\r\n     placed above the other.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FRONT VIEW OF DOUBLE \"DEVON\" TYPE OF SMOKE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n     Glenmarie Estate: Batu Tiga Co.]\r\n\r\n     \"_Platforms._--The loading verandahs or platforms are of ordinary\r\n     'seriah' timber.\r\n\r\n     \"_Compartments and Furnace Chamber._--These are enclosed with Bell's\r\n     'Poilite' sheets, each of which measures 8 feet by 4 feet by 3/16\r\n     inch. The sheets are affixed to the steel stanchions, doors, etc., by\r\n     galvanised bolts (1 inch by 1/4 inch) which pass through iron flats\r\n     measuring 8 feet by 2 inches by 3/8 inch (about). These iron flats\r\n     hold the sheets at the edges. The dimensions of the compartments are 8\r\n     feet by 8 feet by 4 feet.\r\n\r\n     \"_Racks._--These are eight in number, and measure just under 8 feet by\r\n     8 feet by 4 feet. The capacity of each is roughly about 450 lbs., of\r\n     dry sheet rubber. The racks are mounted on 6-inch iron wheels, running\r\n     on rails of stock size, 'T' iron (1-3/4 inches by 1-3/4 inches by 1/4\r\n     inch).\r\n\r\n     \"The sheets are hung on split bamboos. To prevent these projecting\r\n     over the edge of the rack and catching in the doors when the rack is\r\n     moved in or out, a thin strip of wood, about 1/2 inch high, is nailed\r\n     along the sides of the rack.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: SIDE VIEW OF DOUBLE \"DEVON\" TYPE OF SMOKE-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n     Building constructed of galvanised iron. Shows door to furnace\r\n     chamber, and ventilator.]\r\n\r\n     \"_Furnace._--This is of the type that aims at slow combustion. It\r\n     consists of a cast-iron cylinder, 3 feet in diameter and 4 feet high,\r\n     carried on a truck made of a sheet of boiler-plate, and mounted on\r\n     small wheels, so that the whole can be moved easily out of, and into,\r\n     the furnace chamber for easy cleaning and stoking.\r\n\r\n     \"The furnace chamber is a pit lined with concrete, just wide enough\r\n     to take the trolley, and about 12 feet long. The top of the furnace,\r\n     which is almost flush with the ground-level, consists of a sheet of\r\n     zinc or galvanised iron with numerous holes about 3 inches in\r\n     diameter. Over these holes are strips of mosquito gauze, as flame and\r\n     dust arresters (see note below). There are no holes in the sides or\r\n     bottom of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n     \"Over the furnace is hung a baffle-plate, measuring 4 feet by 4 feet.\r\n     Above this, on the first floor-level, the bottom of the compartments\r\n     is covered with wire netting, to prevent any rubber dropping\r\n     accidentally into the furnace chamber. The furnace chamber is fitted\r\n     with an iron-frame door, swinging on perpendicular hinges.\r\n\r\n     \"_Method of Stoking._--The timber used is a mixture of jungle wood and\r\n     rubber-tree wood, cut to lengths of about 1-1/2 feet. In the ordinary\r\n     way the furnace is charged at 6 p.m., and at six-hour intervals a\r\n     little more fuel is added, but a new charge is not necessary. During\r\n     the daytime, when the heat of the sun is sufficient to raise the\r\n     temperature appreciably, a smaller fire is maintained.\r\n\r\n     \"_Temperature._--There is no difficulty in maintaining a temperature\r\n     of 120 deg. F. By continuous smoking, average sheets prepared from\r\n     standardised latex can be fully cured in five days. This represents\r\n     110 hours of smoke-curing, which is at least equal to ten days'\r\n     intermittent smoking in an ordinary house.\r\n\r\n     \"_Capacity._--There are eight racks, each accommodating 450 lbs. of\r\n     standardised sheet rubber. The loading capacity of the house,\r\n     therefore, is 3,600 lbs. As each charge is cured in five days, the\r\n     monthly output may be 21,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n     \"The cubic capacity is 2,048 cubic feet. As there are no gangways,\r\n     etc., this is fully utilised. This gives a rate of monthly output\r\n     capacity to over 10-1/4 lbs. dry rubber per cubic foot of drying\r\n     space; an excellent figure much in advance of values obtained in the\r\n     great majority of ordinary smoke-houses.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Since the above was written, it has been found possible to eliminate\r\nthe gauze. A mild steel top has been made, perforated with 2-inch holes.\r\nPractically no dust is ejected from the furnace, and there are no flames.\r\n\r\nOwing to shortage of supplies during the War, similar buildings have been\r\nerected with frames of well-seasoned hard wood, which was protected by\r\nstrips of asbestos-slate or galvanised iron. The latter material was also\r\nsubstituted in the covering walls. Later, houses were erected of brick,\r\nwith other minor modifications. As a natural development, the latest\r\nbuildings consist of two of the original houses face to face, under a\r\ncommon roof, and served by common platforms.\r\n\r\nAs originally designed, the house was intended to meet the needs of a small\r\nestate, or a division of an estate, having a maximum output of about 20,000\r\nlbs. of sheet rubber per month. The possibility of an extension of this\r\nidea has been shown to be great.\r\n\r\nThe furnace has been described as situated in a pit. Situated on a bank or\r\non sloping ground, it was easy to arrange for withdrawal of the furnace. In\r\nsome cases this has not been possible, and various modifications have been\r\neffected. The most satisfactory yet encountered is that in which a shallow\r\nbrick pit is surmounted by an iron cone, about 4 feet in height. This is\r\nfitted with a cap having small perforations. The fire burns in the pit, and\r\nthe heat is radiated by the cone. It would have been more effective to have\r\nallowed greater height in the furnace chamber, and to have employed the\r\ntravelling drum-furnace as in the original design.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid interference in draught by a space between the bottom of\r\nthe doors of the compartments and the platform (due to the presence of\r\nrails), the floor of the platform is laid level with the top of the rails;\r\nor to the bottom of the doors is attached a swinging flap, notched for\r\naccommodating the rails when in position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are in use houses of other designs, which all more or less vary only\r\nin some modifications from the types described. Hence they do not call for\r\nspecial comment. Recently a rather distinct departure has been noted in a\r\nstructure designated the \"Barker\" smoke-house.\r\n\r\nBARKER PATENT.--In essential this consists of a long narrow structure\r\nerected with an appreciable slope from one end to the other. At the lower\r\nend is a small furnace enclosed in a brick compartment. The smoke from this\r\nfurnace travels up the slope to the other end, at which the rubber enters.\r\nThe sheets are hung on bars which are attached to a unit framework. This\r\nframe slides, by its own weight, upon timber side supports. A sufficient\r\nnumber of these units occupies the full effective length of the structure.\r\nThe removal of \"stops\" at the lower end enables the foremost frame to be\r\nremoved, and the succeeding frames slide into a new position. Thus the\r\nfreshly prepared sheets, entering at the higher end, gradually and\r\nautomatically move towards the furnace as the frames of dry rubber are\r\nremoved from the lower end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW \"BARKER\" TYPE OF SMOKE-HOUSE: A SMALL UNIT.\r\n\r\nThe racks slide automatically from top to bottom on withdrawal of the lower\r\nframes through door at front. The furnace is contained in the brick\r\ncompartment at the lower (front) end.]\r\n\r\nThus far only small units have been seen. It is claimed that, properly\r\nprepared, sheet rubber can be smoke-cured in about five or six days, and it\r\nis stated that installations have been in successful working for\r\nsufficiently long periods to prove their efficacy. The device is better\r\nknown in Java and Sumatra than in Malaya. The capacity of a unit building\r\nis stated to be 7,000 lbs. per month, calculating on a six days' cycle of\r\nworking. In a more recent design provision is made at the lower end for a\r\nwater tank, into which all rubber can be discharged in case of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_OTHER BUILDINGS (continued) AND SITUATION OF BUILDINGS_\r\n\r\n\r\nSORTING-ROOM AND PACKING-ROOM.--It is in these departments that most\r\nfactory installations are lacking. More often than one cares to\r\nacknowledge, sorting and packing are done under conditions which place a\r\npremium upon poor work. As a consequence, consignments of rubber are often\r\nmarred by the inclusion of defective specimens. The result is that\r\nshipments may be rejected when tendered against contracts, or that\r\nallowances in price have to be made. In many instances it would not be fair\r\nto lay the blame upon the manager or an assistant, as it is obviously\r\nimpossible for an individual to inspect every piece of rubber. Neither\r\nwould it be strictly fair in some cases to ascribe the fault to pure\r\ncarelessness on the part of the coolies.\r\n\r\nOften the only provision made for this important work is the lower room of\r\na drying-shed, which may also contain hanging rubber. Under these\r\ncircumstances, space is cramped, and the light often poor. Small defects\r\nmay pass unnoticed, and the general surroundings do not conduce to keen\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWhere, for economic reasons, the sorting and packing operations are\r\nconducted in the drying-shed, there should be ample space free from hanging\r\nrubber, and it should not be possible for wet rubber placed in the upper\r\nroom to drip upon the dry rubber below or upon packed cases. There should\r\nbe plenty of light, and for this reason windows should be ample. Usually\r\nthe window-frames are fitted with wooden shutters, which are preferably\r\nhung on horizontal hinges from the top of the frame. By this device it is\r\nnot necessary to close all windows during a shower of rain, and rubber may\r\nbe stacked near a window with reasonable chance that direct sunlight will\r\nnot be allowed to fall upon it.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with smoked sheet, it is advised that the rubber to be examined\r\nshould be placed upon tables facing the windows, so that each piece may be\r\nscrutinised in a strong light.\r\n\r\nCrepe rubber also is best examined in a strong light, but preferably with\r\none's back towards the source of light or at an angle to it. For this work\r\ncoolies usually are most efficient when sitting on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from the foregoing remarks that the best conditions would\r\nbe secured in a separate building especially constructed. A single room\r\nwould be all that is required; at one end sorting could be undertaken,\r\nwhile packing could be done at the other end. No hanging rubber should be\r\nallowed in the room.\r\n\r\nThe floor should be of hard timber, and raised from the ground, to the\r\nheight approximately of a bullock-cart or motor-lorry, as the case may be.\r\nThe boxes of rubber could thus be transported by small hand-trucks on a\r\nlevel with the transport vehicle, reducing labour to the minimum.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of the building should be good, especially if cases of\r\nrubber are to be stored therein; and the entire structure should be\r\nweather-proof.\r\n\r\nSTORE-ROOMS FOR RUBBER AND STORAGE.--The question of storage of rubber in\r\nfactory buildings has always possessed importance, but has demanded\r\nincreased consideration recently.\r\n\r\nFrom experience in this country, it is clear that cement floors for\r\nstore-rooms or packing-sheds are the least suitable. They are often visibly\r\ndamp, especially in the early morning. To allow rubber, packed or unpacked,\r\nto remain upon a cement floor in the tropics, is to court trouble from\r\nmoulds, external or internal. If the employment of a cement floor is\r\nunavoidable, the rubber and boxes should be raised on wooden supports,\r\ngiving a clearance of at least 3 or 4 inches, and there should be clear\r\nventilation space between tiers of boxes.\r\n\r\nExperience indicates that the best type of floor is that already advised\r\nfor sorting and packing rooms--_i.e._, a good hard timber floor raised at\r\nleast 3 feet above ground-level. Apart from the advantage in labour\r\nspecified in the previous paragraphs, this provision of ample ventilation\r\nspace below the floor is a great consideration in the preservation of the\r\ntimber. Raised store-rooms become essential in low-lying districts which\r\nare at all subject to flooding, yet the writer has seen many boxes of\r\nrubber damaged by flood-water entering a packing-room situated on the\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been raised recently as to the length of the period\r\nduring which rubber may be safely stored in this country. The answer can be\r\nonly supplied by experience, of which up to the present we have none\r\npossible of being classed as reliable. Whatever storage may have been done\r\nin the past has been influenced greatly by the unsuitability of the storage\r\naccommodation, and the fact that often the rubber was not prepared with a\r\nview to prolonged storage.\r\n\r\nWhile the market demand was strong, rubber was being shipped and passed\r\ninto circulation, at a rate which did not demand investigation of the\r\nsubject of local storage. In the year 1918 conditions were such as to bring\r\nthe matter into prominence, and we were able to tender advice on the lines\r\ngiven in this chapter. The necessity passed, but has again arisen.\r\n\r\nOur experience goes to prove that if rubber is properly prepared and\r\nthoroughly dried before packing, it will remain in good condition for a\r\nperiod of a year or more in this country. How much beyond a year it may be\r\nkept remains to be determined. The assumption of \"proper preparation\"\r\nleaves great room for reservations.\r\n\r\nIn the case of crepe rubbers, there is no great difficulty, provided that\r\nthe recognised methods and formulae are employed, and that the rubber is\r\npacked only when perfectly dry. Under those conditions, the higher grades\r\nof crepe remain apparently unaffected on storing. Any appreciable\r\ndeterioration may be attributed to defective preparation or external\r\ncauses, such as accidental damage by water.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged storage of lower grade rubbers is attended by more risk,\r\nespecially in the case of the lowest grade (earth-scrap) from estates which\r\nneglect the practice of regular and frequent collection of the raw product.\r\nThe same reservation applies to crepes made from tree-scrap which is not\r\ncollected daily. In these types of crepe rubber \"tackiness\" may be\r\ninitially present only in small degree, but the final damage may be\r\nimmensely greater by close contact of the folded rubber during prolonged\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to discuss the possibility of storage of smoked sheets, the\r\ndifficulties become immensely greater. We have yet no reliable experience\r\nas to the keeping properties of this grade when properly prepared, fully\r\ncured, correctly packed, and stored under the best of local conditions. It\r\nis understood, of course, that in the qualification by the term \"local\"\r\nconditions, we assume it to be more difficult to store rubber generally in\r\nMalaya than in a temperate climate. The average temperature and humidity of\r\nthe atmosphere are here much more favourable to the development of mould\r\ngrowths than would be the case, say, in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this question, as far as it refers to the preservation by\r\nstoring of smoked sheet rubber, it is not fair to draw conclusions as to\r\nthe likely behaviour of packed rubber from data based upon observation of\r\nloose specimens. We have samples of smoked sheets prepared in 1910, and\r\nthese, superficially, appear to have remained unchanged. No mould is\r\npresent and, as far as intermittent observation enables us to judge, moulds\r\nhave never been incident. Whether such rubber would have been preserved in\r\nthis condition had it formed part of a packed case, is a point upon which\r\nwe have no experience; neither can we give any opinion. It seems true,\r\nhowever, that loose specimens \"keep\" better than bulk samples of the same\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be argued that the present good condition of these old specimens\r\nmay be due to correct preparation. In those days methods and formulae were\r\nrather haphazard, especially in view of the fact that the daily variability\r\nof dry rubber content of latices was not then recognised.\r\n\r\nOne would rather submit the factor of adequate smoke-curing as the chief\r\ninfluence in the superficial preservation of smoked sheets. Ten or eleven\r\nyears ago it was considered advisable to allow the rubber to remain in the\r\nsmoke-house for a period extending well beyond that necessary for ordinary\r\ndrying. As a result, very dark rubber was produced, which was thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with the products of wood combustion. There would seem to be\r\nlittle doubt that this procedure was responsible for the prolonged freedom\r\nfrom mould growths.\r\n\r\nMarket standards have varied to some degree since, with a tendency to\r\nprefer a paler product than that in vogue, say, six or seven years ago.\r\nMoreover, standardised methods of preparation have been introduced, with\r\nthe result that sheets of a desirably high standard can be produced in from\r\nten to fourteen days, when smoke-curing is conducted only during night\r\nhours. Some estates are equipped with smoke-houses which, by continuity of\r\nworking day and night, provide smoke-dried rubber in from five to six days;\r\nbut the actual hours of smoke-curing are approximately equal to those of\r\nthe ordinary type of house.\r\n\r\nThis tendency towards the production of sheets paler in colour than the old\r\nstandard is probably largely responsible in the present for the commonly\r\nobserved incidence of surface moulds on stored smoked sheets, and also for\r\nsome complaints of \"under-curing,\" where the term specifically refers to a\r\nfailure to dry and cure the rubber thoroughly. Boxes of smoked sheets,\r\nwhich had been stored for varying periods up to five months, were recently\r\ninspected, and, in the majority of instances, surface moulds were found to\r\nbe plentiful. In all cases it was observed that the trouble was intensified\r\nwhere boxes of rubber were stored in contact with cement floors.\r\n\r\nThis \"under-curing\" is not a question solely of the duration of\r\nsmoke-drying, although probably the modern practice of curtailing the\r\nperiod has exerted a great influence. To make this clear, it may be stated\r\nthat, given two batches of uniformly prepared wet sheets, it would be\r\npossible to smoke-cure them for equal periods in different houses, so as to\r\nproduce one batch very much paler in colour than the other, although the\r\ntotal hours of actual smoke-curing would be identical. In order to produce\r\nsuch effects, all that is necessary is to employ different timbers for fuel\r\nor different types of furnaces. In the one case there would be produced\r\nheat and very little smoke, while in the other the necessary heat would be\r\nobtained plus plenty of smoke. The best results naturally are obtained by\r\nthe employment of the happy medium, and if smoked sheets have to be stored,\r\nthe ordinary period of smoke-curing should be prolonged to an interval\r\nconsistent with the capacity of the smoke-house.\r\n\r\nAll precautions taken in preparation and curing can be nullified, as\r\nalready indicated, by unsuitable storage conditions.\r\n\r\nTOOL-SHEDS AND STORE-ROOMS.--In some factories it is the rule to see lime,\r\ncement, spare rolls, sieves, and a general heterogeneous assortment\r\noccupying part of the rubber-drying rooms. The inconvenience is often\r\ngreat; and it certainly seems that these stores and tools are of sufficient\r\nvalue to be accommodated in suitable buildings.\r\n\r\nSITUATION OF FACTORY BUILDINGS.--There can be no doubt that a great deal of\r\nthe \"spot\" disease trouble, and the general slowness of drying, can be\r\nattributed in many factories to the unsuitability of the site chosen.\r\nProbably the idea which actuated those responsible for the choice of site\r\ngenerally was proximity to a water supply. This would account for the fact\r\nthat a number of factories are situated in valleys or near swamps. More\r\noften than not, also, the actual clear space is very limited, and rubber\r\ntrees grow close up to the walls of the buildings. Under such\r\ncircumstances, it is difficult to see how these buildings can be anything\r\nbut dark and damp, and it is not difficult to understand the slow rate of\r\ndrying. In a few cases the sites chosen proved to be so unsuitable that the\r\nestates were confronted with a very serious problem, the solution to which\r\nwas, either the erection of another complete set of buildings in a more\r\nsuitable spot or the installation of artificial driers.\r\n\r\nIt must be laid down as an axiom that the first essential in a suitable\r\nsite is that water may be brought to it easily, but, as already indicated,\r\nthis does not mean that the buildings need be placed in actual proximity to\r\nthe water-supply. The mistakes made by pioneers in this work are not likely\r\nto be repeated, and it is common now to note well-designed and\r\ncomprehensive schemes in which the water is pumped to a reservoir placed at\r\na suitable elevation, whence the supply is gravitated to bungalows, coolie\r\nlines, and the factory. The importance of securing a plentiful supply of\r\ngood water for factory purposes cannot be exaggerated, and it is a point\r\nwhich is only thoroughly appreciated on estates where smoke-sheet rubber\r\nhas to be prepared.\r\n\r\nThe second essential, but of equal importance, is that there shall be an\r\nample open space on which the sun may shine all day. There must be no trees\r\ntoo near the buildings, and there should be no adjacent swamps. Preferably,\r\nthe site should be on a raised position, so that it will be impossible for\r\nsurrounding trees to cut off sunshine, even when they are fully grown. From\r\nsuch an arrangement it will follow that the factory will be light and airy,\r\nand the drying-houses will receive the maximum of benefit to drying from\r\ndirect sunshine on the roof and walls. There can be little doubt that these\r\nconsiderations play a most important part in determining the rate of drying\r\nof the rubber, and where comparisons are made between the rates of drying\r\nin various drying-houses all these factors enter into the question and\r\ncontribute to the total result. Presuming that the thin crepes made in two\r\nfactories are equal in thickness, it is not uncommon to find that in a\r\ndrying-house, situated in a wide open space, the period of drying may be as\r\nlow as six or seven days; while in another drying-house, situated near a\r\nswamp and surrounded by trees, the period may be as high as eighteen days\r\nto twenty-one days. The figures quoted are not fictitious, but are facts\r\nactually noted in the course of the writers' experience.\r\n\r\nA great deal also depends upon the exact position of buildings. Thus, to\r\nobtain the maximum of light in a factory, it will be obviously beneficial\r\nto erect it with the long sides running east and west, so that the windows\r\nface the north and south, and the large end doors face the east and west\r\nrespectively. At first sight it would appear that the best position for the\r\nmachines would be on the north side of the building where no sun can enter;\r\nbut a moment's consideration shows that the south side would give the best\r\nresults. By the time the sun has come round to the south, it is usually\r\nhigh in the heavens, and the direct sunshine does not fall very far into\r\nthe room. Even should it play upon the machines for an hour or two during\r\nthe day, no harm could result to the rubber which was being worked, as no\r\npiece would remain there a sufficiently long time to be injured in the\r\nslightest degree. Placed in this position, the maximum benefit of light\r\nwould be obtained, whereas if the length of the building ran east and west,\r\nthe machines would have only either the morning or afternoon light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGGESTED ARRANGEMENT OF BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nWhile it is advisable to erect a factory running east and west, the\r\ndrying-houses should run north and south. In this position the maximum wall\r\narea will be exposed to the sun during the day, and it will be possible to\r\nmanipulate the windows of the drying-rooms so that those along one side are\r\nopen, and it will never be necessary to close all the windows at any time\r\nof the day. Thus the windows facing east will be closed, and those facing\r\nwest will be open until after midday; then _vice versa_. With such an\r\narrangement a more uniform temperature may be obtained than by any other\r\narrangement of the buildings. If the building ran east and west, the\r\nwindows on the north side could remain open all day, while those facing\r\nsouth would have to remain closed practically all day. The south side of\r\nthe house would be heated by the sun, while the north side would remain\r\ncool, and the rates of drying would be correspondingly unequal. The total\r\nwall area heated by the sun at any time of the day would be less in this\r\nposition than if the house ran north and south.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to obtain the best drying effect during the daytime in a\r\nsmoke-house the building should run north and south. By this means the\r\ntemperature will be maintained to the maximum possible by sun heat, and the\r\nrate of drying will correspond.\r\n\r\n\r\n_References to Sketch Plan._\r\n\r\nDrying-house No. 2 should be of two storeys, and unless a separate sorting\r\nand packing room is to be built, No. 1 should also have two floors (see\r\nprevious notes on packing-rooms).\r\n\r\nIn the factory--\r\n\r\n     _V_ shows the position of the verandah, which may be quite open and\r\n     only divided from the inner room by\r\n\r\n     _S_, a wall composed of very strong expanded metal, which allows light\r\n     and air to enter the factory.\r\n\r\n     _T,T_ are the glazed tile tanks for the reception of latex, scrap\r\n     rubbers, and bark-shavings.\r\n\r\n     _M_ shows the position of the machines on the south side of the\r\n     factory, with the direction of extensions, and\r\n\r\n     _E,E_ the compartments in which the engines are bedded. In these\r\n     positions it is possible to obtain direct drive to the machines.\r\n\r\n     _D,D_ are large double swing or sliding doors (the latter for\r\n     preference always). These, while suiting transport of rubber, provide\r\n     also for a free draught of air.\r\n\r\nIf possible the scrap-washing machine should be placed outside the wall of\r\nthe factory, and tanks for the reception of scrap rubbers may then be\r\nsituated in convenient proximity.\r\n\r\nEconomy of labour is obtained by grouping all factory buildings as closely\r\nas possible, but it should be borne in mind that smoke-houses should be\r\nregarded as a possible source of danger from fire. This point has a\r\npractical bearing upon rates of insurance, and it is essential that the\r\nsmoke-house should be situated at a minimum of 50 feet from any other\r\nbuilding or group of buildings. In this connection, also, it may be noted,\r\nas being of further practical interest, that, in the insurance of\r\nsmoke-houses, preferential rates are given to those having a good type of\r\nslow-combustion furnace.\r\n\r\nCHOOSING A FACTORY SITE.--Sufficient has been written to make it clear that\r\nthe choice of a site for factory buildings is a matter demanding weighty\r\nconsideration. Much, of course, depends upon the planted area, and the rate\r\nat which it comes into bearing. Under certain circumstances which will be\r\nobvious, it is permissible to instal first a group of buildings of a\r\ntemporary nature only, the future site and permanent buildings to be chosen\r\nlater when the main portion of the estate comes into bearing. Often,\r\nhowever, one finds that, from lack of forethought, the estate has been\r\ncommitted to considerable expense in the establishment of equipment, which\r\nlater is proved to be unfavourably situated with regard to the majority of\r\nthe area in ultimate bearing. In such case, transport of latex is fraught\r\nwith difficulties and may be expensive.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of an estate which will gradually come into bearing, it is\r\nnot easy to decide whether a temporary installation shall first be\r\nprovided, or whether, in anticipation of future demands, a complete\r\nequipment shall be erected. So much depends upon the financial aspect of\r\nthe question, and upon the rate at which areas will come into bearing. As\r\nfar as is possible, the best policy would be that of a compromise under\r\nwhich the site would suit later requirements, and the factory would be so\r\nplanned as to be capable of future easy extensions both of buildings and\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to lay down any definite data as regards requirements\r\nbased on acreage, or to make comparisons between any two estates of similar\r\nacreage. The important factors determining such requirements are:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Area.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Shape of the estate.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Topography of the estate.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Available supplies of water.\r\n\r\nNaturally the ideal site for factory buildings would lie in a central\r\nposition, given other favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nCENTRALISATION OR DECENTRALISATION.--It is the experience of a number of\r\nestates that, all other conditions being favourable, there is a limit\r\nbeyond which the centralisation of factory work leads to an unwieldy\r\nposition. We are not here concerned with the few extremely large estates\r\nrunning into tens of thousands of acres. In those cases the total area\r\nwould be divided into economic sections. The argument there would resolve\r\nitself into a discussion on the size of an economic section. This, in turn,\r\nwould be dependent upon the type of main product, involving the question of\r\ntransport of latex or coagulum, and the possible provision of batteries of\r\nheavy machinery.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation between the transport of latex and coagulum,\r\nrespectively, is a most important one, and has a powerful influence in\r\ndetermination of the maximum of centralisation possible. Whereas properly\r\nprepared coagulum may be safely transported by bullock-cart, light-railway,\r\nor motor vehicle for many miles, latex, on the other hand, demands very\r\ncareful treatment. Anti-coagulants may be employed to preserve fluidity,\r\nbut only within certain limits. Even under these conditions, other factors\r\n(chiefly climatic) exert an influence which renders the transport of latex\r\nfor any distance a matter of anxiety.\r\n\r\nIt will be plain, therefore, that the limits of centralisation of factory\r\nwork are much narrower for the preparation of sheet rubber than is the case\r\nwhen crepe rubber is to be made. In actual experience the preparation of a\r\nhigh standard and a high percentage of smoked sheet is attended with\r\nconsiderable difficulty in those cases where the factory processes have\r\nbeen ultra-centralised. Apart from the difficulties inherent to the\r\ntransport of latex in a state of good preservation, there is the added\r\ndifficulty of dealing quickly with large volumes of latex brought from\r\nvarious quarters. None of these should be allowed to remain standing if the\r\nbest results are to be secured; but obviously there must at times be some\r\ncongestion. Even on a small scale it is often found that the latest batches\r\nof latex are unfit for the preparation of good sheet rubber, and the\r\ntrouble may be easily exaggerated when working on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe centralisation of work on crepe preparation, therefore, is limited only\r\nto a comparatively slight degree by distance of transport, and in the main\r\nonly by the size of the necessary equipment of machinery and drying\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nThe successful preparation of sheet rubber is, on the contrary, governed\r\nchiefly by the factor of transport. With this consideration in view,\r\nseveral large estates, preparing sheet rubber as the chief grade, have\r\nfound it necessary to decentralise the factory work, with very satisfactory\r\nresults. Outlying sections are given uniform and complete equipments of\r\nnecessary buildings on a small scale, and hand-driven light machines.\r\nUniform coagulating tanks are installed, and the methods and quantities of\r\nchemicals employed are carefully standardised. Experience has shown that\r\noften the best sheet rubber coming to the market has been prepared on small\r\nestates; and the same applies to the product of these decentralised\r\nstations on large estates. There is no _a priori_ reason why the product\r\nfrom one station should differ in the smallest particular from that of\r\nanother, apart from minor fluctuations which are due to variable weather\r\nconditions affecting the latex. If the contrary is found to be the case, it\r\nindicates failure on the part of the person responsible to follow the\r\nregular rules and methods.\r\n\r\nIn the natural scheme of development of a large estate, it would be\r\nnecessary, of course, to have a comparatively small centrally situated\r\nfactory, equipped with power and heavy machinery for working scrap rubbers\r\nin the preparation of crepe grades below No. 1 in quality. As the yield per\r\nacre increases, or the area in bearing expands, it would be advisable later\r\nto increase the size of the central factory and buildings so as to permit\r\nof the preparation of a proportion of the crop in the form of No. 1 crepe\r\nrubber, in order to be able to comply with prevailing market demands under\r\nwhich preferential rates fluctuate between pale crepe and smoked sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nTHE FINISHED RUBBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_DEFECTS IN CREPE RUBBERS_\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STYLE OF FINISH.--Broadly, there is no single and definite style of\r\nfinish, but on the whole it may be stated that the greater proportion of\r\ncrepe rubbers are prepared in a thin form and with a close-knit texture or\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nVery little thick or blanket crepe is now made on estates in Malaya, so\r\nthat beyond the mention of that type little need be written. A fair amount\r\nof blanket crepe is sold in the Singapore market, but it should generally\r\nbe regarded as re-made rubber--_i.e._, it may have been prepared from thin\r\ncrepes, or from native pale sheets, in local rubber-washing factories. In\r\nappearance these crepes have a rough finish, and vary in colour according\r\nto the crude material employed.\r\n\r\nThe general preference of the market at present is for a thin,\r\nsmooth-finished crepe, with a close-knitted surface--_i.e._, free from what\r\nis described as \"laciness.\" What effect this looseness of finish can\r\npossibly have upon the quality of the rubber is not understood, but the\r\nstandard type set up by the market must be comparatively free from small\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions governing the sale and purchase of rubber,\r\nvarious \"standards\" are set up. These really have no bearing upon the\r\nintrinsic qualities of the rubber, and are concerned almost entirely with\r\nsuperficial attributes. They are necessary in the absence of any proper\r\nscheme of evaluation for the establishment of certain standards of\r\ncomparison, which imply that the rubber is apparently clean, free from\r\ncertain recognised defects, and has been carefully prepared--as far as can\r\nbe determined by a superficial examination. Thus the question of \"finish\"\r\nhas attained disproportionate importance, but must be respected when\r\npreparing rubber for sale.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions, thin crepe rubber, as it leaves the finishing\r\nmachines, has what may be termed \"deckled\" edges. On many estates, in order\r\nto comply with market conditions, the edges of the wet crepe are trimmed,\r\nand the trimmings re-made into lengths of crepe. This is done under the\r\nimpression that the market price is influenced by the evenness of the edges\r\nof crepe rubbers.\r\n\r\nAgain, it sometimes happens that, owing to \"wear\" of the rolls, the\r\nfinished dry crepe may show a faint but distinct pattern of mark--a diamond\r\nor a horizontal bar. Since these are not accepted under the \"standard\"\r\ncomparisons, rubber exhibiting these characteristics does not obtain the\r\ntop market price. In other words, these innocent and innocuous marks are\r\nregarded as defects and penalised accordingly.\r\n\r\nEnough has been written to show how very important becomes the question of\r\nfinish. It will be acknowledged that the superficial qualities demanded in\r\nthe \"standard\" market type can be reproduced by any estate having adequate\r\nmachinery and ample facilities for drying and handling the rubber.\r\n\r\nMethods of preparation and formulae for the employment of chemicals are so\r\nwell laid down that, up to the stage of machining, no difficulty need be\r\nencountered. But the standard type of finish in the dry crepes cannot be\r\nobtained unless the estate factory is fully equipped with the three types\r\nof rolls necessary--_i.e._, macerators, intermediate crepers, and smooth\r\nfinishing-rolls. This subject has received full discussion in Chapter\r\nXIII., and is here only mentioned with the view of emphasising the point\r\nthat no estate can be blamed for a lack of \"finish\" in crepe rubbers if the\r\nequipment of machinery is inadequate or in poor condition.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the factory has ample machinery for requirements,\r\nand a good finish cannot be obtained on the thin crepe, then it is time the\r\nrolls were attended to and changed, or that the ratios of the driving\r\npinions were altered.\r\n\r\nDIRTY EDGES.--It seems to be almost impossible to keep old machines clean,\r\nand it is equally difficult to keep the edges of crepe free from oil and\r\ndirt. Usually these dark edges are to be found on crepe which is rather\r\nwide, and it will be noticed that where wide crepe is made, unless special\r\nprecautions are taken, the edges of the rubber often pass under the edges\r\nof the hopper and so pick up dirt and oil. On most machines it is a great\r\nmistake to attempt the preparation of wide crepe; nothing but narrow crepe\r\nmust be made. To obtain this it is necessary to decrease the width of the\r\nhopper placed above the rolls. This can easily be effected by blocks of\r\nheavy hard wood, cut to shape and fastened in position.\r\n\r\nSometimes the dark edges of crepe are due to another cause. Rolls may be\r\ngradually worn in the middle, so that to obtain a good finish it becomes\r\nincreasingly necessary to tighten up the screws which regulate the distance\r\nbetween the rolls. It thus happens that just at, and beyond, the edges of\r\nthe rubber the rolls grind upon each other, and fine particles of iron and\r\ngraphite are transferred to the rubber. In such a case it is evident that\r\neither the rolls must be \"turned\" or that a new pair of rolls must be\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nIRON-STAINS.--One of the causes of iron-stain on rubber has been mentioned\r\nin the preceding paragraph. This particular kind of iron-stain must not be\r\nconfounded with rust-stain, and gives a dark dirty colour. It results from\r\nthe grinding together of the rolls, and is usually noticed in the finishing\r\nof fine pale crepe. For this operation it is necessary to screw up the\r\nrolls tightly, and it will be plain that, whenever the rolls are vacant of\r\nrubber, there is a tendency for them to grind upon each other, thus setting\r\nfree fine particles of iron and graphite. In order to avoid this, one must\r\nbe careful to see that between the working of each length of fine crepe the\r\nrolls should be occupied with another piece of rubber, which may be kept\r\nfor the purpose. In some factories this trouble apparently does not exist,\r\nwhile in others the amount of wear on the rolls is surprisingly great, and\r\nthe damage done to the rubber is excessive. The only way in which this\r\ndifference can be accounted for is that there must be a great difference\r\nin the quality of the roll material. Some rolls seem to be excessively\r\nsoft, and from these contamination by iron-stain is great. For this reason\r\nrolls are sometimes rejected, and there would appear to be an objection to\r\nany but chilled steel rolls for the final stage of finishing crepe rubbers.\r\n\r\nRUST-STAINS.--Rust-stains, on the other hand, throw the responsibility\r\nentirely upon the labour and supervision of the factory. Rust is formed\r\nupon the rolls when they are at rest, and any one passing pale rubber\r\nbetween the rolls before they have been thoroughly cleaned is guilty of\r\nculpable negligence. Even when apparently clean, a piece of lower grade\r\nrubber should be passed through the rolls several times so as to remove any\r\nslight trace of rust remaining.\r\n\r\nRust-stains have also been caused in a few cases by the large knives which\r\nare used to cut up lumps of coagulum, or by allowing freshly coagulated\r\nrubber to come into contact with iron vessels in the factory.\r\n\r\nA similar appearance has been traced in a few instances to contamination of\r\nthe coagulum in transit by the dust of the reddish rock (laterite) employed\r\nin localities for road-making.\r\n\r\nOIL-MARKS.--The origin of oil-marks in crepe has already been described in\r\nChapter XIII. The whole question resolves itself into one of cleanliness,\r\nmoderation in lubrication, and supervision. The machines should be\r\ninspected every day, and once a week rolls may be swabbed down with a 10\r\nper cent. solution of caustic soda applied by means of a piece of cloth\r\nfastened round the end of a stick. Immediately after this operation water\r\nshould be turned on and the rolls set in motion, so that all traces of\r\ncaustic soda are thoroughly removed. If possible, lubrication by oil should\r\nbe substituted by grease lubrication through screw caps.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be paid to the back of the machines. None but\r\nthe individual in charge of engines should be allowed to lubricate the\r\nmachines, and he should be held responsible for any excess of lubricant.\r\n\r\nAs a rule oil-marks are restricted to the edges or the proximity of the\r\nedges of crepe, but sometimes the streak is to be found in the middle of\r\nthe length. In such a case it is almost certain that the oil or grease has\r\nbeen picked up by the rubber in the tray. It sometimes happens, if the\r\n\"liners\" of the bearings are eccentrically worn, that a few drops of dirty\r\noil or a particle of grease are squirted out to some distance. These\r\nusually find a resting-place in the tray, and the contamination may then\r\nappear in any part of the rubber.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear, therefore, that all trays beneath machines should be\r\nexamined as the probable source of danger from contamination by oil and\r\ndirt. If the trays are as wide as or wider than the effective portion of\r\nthe rolls, they should be discarded. In their place (except sometimes in\r\nthe case of the macerating machine) all that is necessary is a movable\r\npiece of board, in width not less than from 4 to 6 inches shorter than the\r\nwidth of the rolls. Any oil or grease ejected from the bearings will thus\r\nbe allowed to fall clear of the board; and defects due to oil streaks,\r\netc., will be very much diminished, if not entirely obviated.\r\n\r\nThis point in connection with the damage possible by the existence of wide\r\ntrays is commended to the notice of manufacturers of machines for\r\nplantations, as it is common to find that trays are made which contravene\r\nthe rule prescribed by experience. In fact, trays on some machines have\r\nbeen so designed as to act as \"traps\" for all dirty matter exuding from the\r\nbearings. Not only so; they are sometimes made of such a shape and height\r\nthat oil or grease lodging upon the edges act as a \"wipe\" to the rolls,\r\nthus increasing the possibility of contamination. Until this defect was\r\ninvestigated, it was common to note continued contamination of pale crepes\r\nin spite of all precautions taken in cleaning the rolls at frequent\r\nintervals. The trouble due to this cause is intensified when the same\r\nmachines are employed for the preparation of scrap-rubber crepes and No. 1\r\ncrepe. Small pieces of scrap find their way towards the bearings and lodge\r\non the edges of the trays. Unless a thorough inspection is made before\r\nproceeding with the working of the No. 1 (pale) grade, contamination may be\r\ncontinuous.\r\n\r\nDIRT.--Streaks due to the presence of dirt (as apart from oil or grease\r\ncontamination, or that due to pieces of oxidised scrap) are unusual, and\r\nwhen they do appear their origin seems to be somewhat of a mystery. It\r\ncould scarcely be advanced that the dirt was picked up on the machines, as\r\nit is difficult to imagine where such dirt could come from. In one or two\r\ninstances there has been fairly clear evidence that the dirt was contained\r\nin the coagulum, and the only explanation fitting the case is that it fell\r\ninto the latex after straining and during the course of coagulation. On\r\ncutting open lumps of coagulum brought in from the field division, it has\r\nsometimes been noticed that dirt is included, and the foregoing explanation\r\nis the only reasonable one. How it was possible for dirt to get into the\r\nlatex must be left for explanation to those better acquainted with the\r\nconditions under which the latex was coagulated.\r\n\r\nHOLES.--On some estates it would seem impossible, with the existing\r\nmachines, to make really good crepe. The complaint is that, if thin crepe\r\nis attempted, it is invariably found to be \"full of holes\"; and as,\r\napparently, the presence or absence of small holes in crepe rubber is a\r\nfactor which influences buyers, this defect must be avoided at all costs.\r\nWhy this matter of small holes in thin crepe should weigh so heavily with\r\nbuyers is a matter which the writers are not in a position to explain. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the presence of small holes is most generally an indication\r\nthat the rubber has received the minimum amount of working on the rolls\r\nconsistent with good washing. Further working would only be undertaken with\r\nthe idea of so consolidating the rubber as to get rid of holes in order to\r\nmeet the market scheme of valuation.\r\n\r\nThis is usually achieved by making a very thin crepe and rolling together\r\ntwo lengths when wet. The resulting crepe may be slightly thicker than\r\nordinary, and the method employed may be usually detected by the appearance\r\nof the edges unless these are trimmed.\r\n\r\nGREENISH AND TACKY STREAKS.--Occasionally one meets cases in which pale\r\ncrepe exhibits streaks varying in colour from a decided green to an almost\r\nblack in which the greenish tinge is scarcely perceptible. Experience\r\nindicates that these streaks are much more dangerous than they appear\r\nsuperficially, inasmuch as they contain traces of brass from the \"liners\"\r\nof the bearings. The presence of the copper in brass is responsible for a\r\ngradual disintegration of the rubber, commonly recognised as \"tackiness.\"\r\nIn fact, copper may be said to be a \"poison\" to rubber, and every effort\r\nshould be made to avoid possible sources of contamination. The effect may\r\nbe proved easily and perceptibly by fastening together several pieces of\r\ncrepe rubber by means of a brass \"paper-fastener.\" In course of time a salt\r\nof copper, green in colour, will be formed, and it will be found that the\r\nportions of rubber in contact with the fastener have \"perished\" and become\r\ntacky.\r\n\r\nThis contamination of crepe rubber may take place in two ways:\r\n\r\n     (1) By the ejection of actual particles of brass from the bearings of\r\n     machines, due to eccentric grinding of the \"standards\" of the rolls\r\n     upon the brass \"bushes.\" These particles are carried by exuded oil or\r\n     grease into trays, and thence to the rubber.\r\n\r\n     (2) By the action of an acid lubricant upon the brass, with the\r\n     formation of a metallic soap which has a decided green colour, unless\r\n     obscured by the dark colour of the oil or grease. It is transferred to\r\n     the crepe rubber in the manner indicated above.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable effect, apart from the superficial defect, is incipient\r\ntackiness. The extent to which this may develop will depend upon the amount\r\nof the copper compound present, but it should be remembered that an\r\nexceedingly small trace is capable of causing a disproportionately large\r\namount of damage. This effect is further magnified if the \"tacky\" piece of\r\nrubber is packed in close contact with previously unaffected rubber.\r\n\r\nWhen the defect is discovered, the affected portions should be cut out, and\r\nthe cuttings should be burned. To mix them with the lowest scrap grades, as\r\nmay be done thoughtlessly, is only inviting further trouble.\r\n\r\nBesides the source of danger already indicated, it may be found, but far\r\nless frequently, that contamination may arise from the presence in the\r\nrubber of small pieces of the brass mesh which is generally used for\r\nstraining latex.\r\n\r\nThe view appears to be held in some quarters that these tacky streaks and\r\npatches in crepe rubber may arise from contamination with oil or grease\r\nalone. This does not agree with our experience. An experiment was made to\r\ntest the point using fresh oil and grease drawn from drums in stock,\r\nspecimens of the same lubricants to which traces of a copper salt were\r\nadded, and samples of lubricants taken from the bearings of several\r\nmachines. The treated pieces of rubber were placed in contact with\r\nuntreated pieces of crepe which served as \"blanks.\"\r\n\r\nNotes were made at intervals extending over a period of two years. The\r\nconclusions arrived at were:\r\n\r\n     (1) Although there was surface discoloration, no tackiness had been\r\n     caused by fresh (unadulterated) lubricant; neither were the \"blanks\"\r\n     affected.\r\n\r\n     (2) In the majority of specimens upon which had been smeared a small\r\n     streak of lubricant taken from the bearings of machines, tackiness had\r\n     supervened, and had developed likewise in the contact \"blanks.\"\r\n\r\n     (3) In all cases where a trace of copper salt had been used to\r\n     adulterate the fresh lubricant, tackiness was to be noted in the\r\n     course of a short period (a week upwards) after the rubber was dry.\r\n     Development was slow, but progressive, over the full period of\r\n     experiment, and the \"blanks\" in contact were affected. The degree of\r\n     affection was determined by the proportion of copper salt employed. In\r\n     the worst cases the affected strip of rubber had deteriorated and\r\n     disintegrated to such a degree as to cause a distinct longitudinal\r\n     gap, the edges of which appeared to consist of a moist gummy substance\r\n     of a deep syrup colour. The adjacent blanks in some cases exhibited a\r\n     similar appearance in lesser degree, or were merely affected by a\r\n     characteristic brownish stain.\r\n\r\nThese observations regarding the possibility of damage to crepe rubbers\r\nfrom the existence of brass \"liners\" or \"bushes\" in the bearings of the\r\nmachines lead to the natural query as to whether the use of brass is\r\nnecessary. Experience shows that it is not necessary. Machines in use for\r\nyears have been running with plain bearings of iron or other metallic\r\nsubstances. Satisfaction is obtained without the use of brass.\r\n\r\nCOTTON AND OTHER FIBRE.--One of the most frequent complaints made against\r\nlow grade crepes is the presence of fibre--generally classed in a wholesale\r\nfashion as \"cotton-waste.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that some years ago most of the complaints were genuine in\r\nreferring the cause to cotton-waste. The defect arose chiefly owing to the\r\ncareless use of this material in the factory. Lumps of waste when discarded\r\nwere often thrown to the ground, and became mixed with the heaps of scrap\r\nrubber and bark-shavings awaiting attention. The fault was one of sheer\r\nnegligence, and nothing can be advanced in extenuation. Even when the\r\nsoiled waste was thrown into the external drains, it often returned to the\r\nfactory mixed up with the scraps of rubber recovered by means of the\r\ndrain-screens.\r\n\r\nAs far as the complaint concerns itself with cotton-waste only, the remedy\r\nis plain, and lies in the power of the management by reason of the ability\r\nto restrict the use of \"waste\" only to the engine-drivers and mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases, however, the defect arises from\r\ncircumstances beyond the direct control of the factory, and under\r\nconditions which make it difficult to check the evil. Although against\r\ninstructions, and for the purpose of fulfilling other orders, some coolies\r\npersist in using pieces of cloth for cleaning cups. In course of time,\r\nunless the practice is detected, this cloth becomes coated with rubber.\r\nCareless coolies throw it away, when it may be collected by the individuals\r\nwho gather earth-scrap; or it may be brought into the factory in the\r\ntappers' scrap-bag.\r\n\r\nCases have been known in which the fibrous matter observed in the dry crepe\r\nrubber was of such a nature as to indicate that the source might be\r\nattributed to leaf-stalks which had passed through the scrap-washer. It is\r\nan easy matter to condemn the sorting as being careless, but it is another\r\nmatter to instil into the mind of factory coolies such a respect for easy\r\nand sane precautions that the practice of them will be continued when the\r\neye of the supervisor is not fixed upon the workers.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that contamination by fibrous matter should be limited\r\npractically to the lowest grades of rubber.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of cotton-waste in high-grade crepes must be most unusual,\r\nand the writers have not yet seen a case in a drying-house. That it does\r\noccur, however, seems to be evident from brokers' reports. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to imagine how the waste enters the rubber. One possible\r\nexplanation is that a coolie may have been cleaning the rolls\r\nsurreptitiously with waste, which may have passed later into the rolls\r\ntogether with rubber. Another explanation was offered in one factory by the\r\nobserved fact that coolies engaged in cutting up coagulum, ready for\r\npassing into the machines, kept a wad of waste for the purpose of keeping\r\nthe knife-blade clean. This may have found its way into the rolls. It must\r\nbe recorded that in the course of many years of experience no case has been\r\nseen in any drying-house of contamination of the higher grades of crepe by\r\nfibrous matter.\r\n\r\nBARK AND GRIT.--With ordinary machines and the usual process of working, it\r\nwould seem impossible to wash and macerate some of the scrap rubbers\r\nsufficiently to free them entirely from bark. This applies specially to the\r\ngrade of rubber prepared from bark-shavings. Specimens have been handled in\r\nwhich it was practically impossible to detect bark, but in such instances\r\nthe amount of working necessary would be such as to interfere seriously\r\nwith the regular working of the factory. Even with the employment of\r\nspecial scrap-washing machines, complaints of the presence of bark in dry\r\ncrepe have been received, but it is certain that this mode of operation\r\nreduces the quantity of bark to a minimum. While fully realising that the\r\namount of working it is possible to give in proportion to the existing\r\nmachinery and the output per day is limited, it must be recognised that the\r\nworking of lower grades of rubber is usually insufficient, and that where\r\npossible it is the duty of estates to pay more attention to these lower\r\ngrades. A considerable improvement in this direction has been noticed of\r\nrecent years. It is not uncommon to encounter managers who fail to\r\nappreciate that complaints regarding the presence of bark in the lower\r\ngrades are founded on legitimate grounds, and that they are not frivolous\r\nobjections put forward for the purpose of depressing the price of the\r\narticle. The sooner such an idea is jettisoned the better. There would\r\nappear to be a good future demand for the lower grades, and it is only\r\nnatural that consumers will be willing to pay the best price only for an\r\narticle which is clean.\r\n\r\nThe same arguments apply to the complaints regarding the presence of sand\r\nand grit. The quantity of the latter found in low-grade crepes from some\r\nestates is surprisingly high. Its presence can often be shown by the simple\r\ndevice of spreading a piece of crepe over the upturned and hollowed palm of\r\none hand, while striking the rubber with the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of bark in higher grades of crepe may be due to inadvertence\r\nor to gross negligence. In the former class one might put those occasions\r\non which pieces of bark are embedded in lumps of naturally coagulated\r\nrubber. A piece of bark-shaving may fall unnoticed into latex and be\r\npartially responsible for the coagulation which takes place. This piece of\r\ncoagulated lump may be massed with others, and hence, unless each small\r\npiece is cut up, the bark is not perceived. Or again, by some unknown\r\nmeans, a piece of shaving may drop into a jar of latex, and so become\r\nembedded in the coagulum. Sometimes this becomes evident on cutting up the\r\nrubber, but it is quite as likely to pass unseen. On the whole, the\r\npresence of bark in first-grade rubber is most unusual, and should be seen\r\nbefore the rubber is packed.\r\n\r\nIn the class due to negligence may be included cases in which careless\r\ncoolies place the cup upon the ground before tapping. Pieces of shavings\r\nfall into the cup, and coolies are too lazy to pick them out. More often\r\nthan not coagulation in the cup is caused. As it is impossible for the\r\nEuropean staff to supervise each individual tree tapped, some cases must\r\ncontinue to pass unheeded. Sometimes bark-shavings are brought in with the\r\nlatex, and if a broken sieve is being used, these, with other impurities,\r\npass into the jar, and are embedded in the coagulated rubber. This must be\r\nclassified as negligence, for no manager would willingly allow the use of a\r\nbroken sieve. Again, naturally coagulated lump rubber on arrival at the\r\nfactory sometimes contains evident pieces of bark, leaves, and stems of\r\nleaves. For lack of supervision the average coolie would not think of\r\npicking out these obvious impurities, and would pass the whole mass into\r\nthe machines.\r\n\r\nOXIDATION STREAKS.--Since the introduction of sodium bisulphite defects due\r\nto streaks, caused by portions of the coagulum becoming oxidised, have\r\npractically ceased to exist. In the usual course, and without the use of an\r\nantiseptic agent, the freshly coagulated rubber has a surface darkened by\r\noxidation. Unless this dark surface were carefully cut off, there would\r\nresult a crepe containing dark streaks caused by the mixture of the\r\noxidised surface portion with the bulk of the paler coagulum. The presence\r\nof oxidation streaks in No. 1 crepes, now being made, would imply either\r\nthat no anti-oxidant substance was in use, or that the quantity necessary\r\nto prevent this surface oxidation is exceedingly small. Although the price\r\nobtained would appear to be influenced by the presence of oxidation\r\nstreaks, no evidence can be obtained that the actual quality of the rubber\r\nsuffers to the same degree as does the appearance--_i.e._, there is no\r\nevidence to show that a pale rubber, in which surface oxidation has been\r\ninhibited, is intrinsically superior to one in which slight natural\r\noxidation has been incident.\r\n\r\n\"YELLOW LATEX\" STREAKS.--This appearance of \"yellow-latex\" streaks in not\r\ncommon, and may be accounted for by incomplete mixture of two different\r\nlatices. It is a fact of common observation that, when a new portion of\r\nbark is being tapped for the first time, there is a distinct yellow tinge\r\nin the latex excluded. As tapping progresses, this colour vanishes; usually\r\nit may persist for a period varying from two weeks to more than a month.\r\nShould this latex be poured into ordinary latex without thorough mixing, it\r\nis sometimes found that, when the crepe rubber is dry, there are distinct\r\nyellow streaks. It should be remembered that, as the rubber content of the\r\nlatex from first tappings is high, this latex is lighter than latex which\r\nis more dilute, so that the mixed latices must be well stirred with a broad\r\npaddle to obtain intimate mixture. It would be much better to keep yellow\r\nlatex apart, and coagulate it separately, if at all possible. In such case\r\nthe resultant crepe may be of a distinct canary yellow in tint.\r\n\r\nIn scrap-crepes of the higher grade this distinct yellow colour is often\r\nvisible in streaks which indicate the presence of tree-scrap, etc.,\r\nobtained from recently opened tapping areas.\r\n\r\nBISULPHITE STREAKS.--These, again, arise from defective mixing. In the dry\r\nrubber it is seen that there are streaks of colourless rubber in a general\r\nmass, which may be of varying shades of yellow; or, a length of exceedingly\r\npale rubber is apparently streaked in patches with a darker shade of\r\ncolour. A solution of sodium bisulphite is heavier than latex, and there\r\nwould be a tendency, therefore, for the chemical to sink in the large\r\nmixing jar. Unless stirring is thorough it is possible that portions of the\r\nlatex would not be in contact with sodium bisulphite while others receive\r\nmore than a fair share. Especially would this effect be seen where\r\ncoagulation takes place quickly, and experience bears out the truth of the\r\nsuggestion. Another factor which has some bearing on the point is the\r\nstrength of solution in which sodium bisulphite is used. In the ordinary\r\ncourse of working, the acid coagulant is added immediately after sodium\r\nbisulphite has been stirred in. Should a strong solution of the bisulphite\r\nbe used, and if coagulation takes place quickly, it is easy to see that the\r\npossibilities of obtaining a uniform and intimate mixture are small.\r\nProbably in no factory is the sodium bisulphite now added to latex in\r\npowder form, but it has been found that if care is not taken to see that\r\nall the bisulphite has dissolved before the solution is added to latex\r\nstreaks may result in the dry rubber. The undissolved particles sink to the\r\nbottom of the coagulating jar or tank, and there slowly dissolve, forming\r\nlocal strong solutions. The effect upon the rubber in the vicinity of these\r\nstrong solutions is much more marked than in the bulk of the coagulum, and\r\nhence lighter streaks or patches appear in the dry rubber. In spite of\r\napparently complete mixture by good stirring, it will be seen that it is\r\npossible, therefore, to have failed in this direction if any undissolved\r\npowder remains in the solution of sodium bisulphite.\r\n\r\n\"SPOT\" DISEASE.--Few managers of estates preparing pale crepe rubbers are\r\nunacquainted with this defect. It is manifested by the appearance of small\r\ncoloured spots varying in density (_i.e._, number to a unit area) and\r\ndiffering in hue. The most common colours are black and orange, but \"spots\"\r\nof brick-red, yellow, violet and ruby and green tints have been noted, the\r\nlast named very seldom. Sometimes in place of definite \"spots,\" or\r\ncolonies, the colour is spread over practically the whole surface of the\r\nrubber as a \"flush.\"\r\n\r\nThese coloured spots, or \"flushes,\" indicate infection by minute fungi,\r\nwhich are present in the latex prior to coagulation. The infection of the\r\nlatex takes place in the field by means of spores, which are only visible\r\nwith a microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is not feasible to discuss any method of preventing this infection of\r\nlatex by air-borne spores, as the eventual preventive measures are so\r\nsimple. But it may be believed that under ordinary weather conditions most\r\nlatices are infected before reaching the factory. It is likewise true that\r\neven fine pale crepes shipped in perfect condition may contain\r\npossibilities of trouble in the form of \"dormant\" spores, the development\r\nof which may commence and continue if favourable conditions arise.\r\n\r\nThe subject of \"'Spot' Diseases\" has been treated fully in previous\r\npublications,[19] and it is not proposed here to enter into any lengthy\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n[19] \"Preparation of Plantation Rubber,\" Sidney Morgan, 1913. \"Spotting of\r\nPlantation Rubber,\" Keith Bancroft, 1913; Bulletin No. 16, F.M.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. \"Spotting of Prepared Plantation Rubber,\" A.\r\nSharpies, 1914; Bulletin No. 19, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf any reader is desirous of producing the defect experimentally, all that\r\nis necessary is to prepare a piece of crepe rubber of rather more than\r\nordinary thickness, roll it up while wet, and place aside for some days.\r\n\r\nThis experiment reproduces the conditions favourable for the development of\r\nthe spores, and spots of various colours may result. It will be clear that\r\nthe chief factor influencing the result is the continued presence of plenty\r\nof moisture.\r\n\r\nThis condition may be created inadvertently in the course of factory\r\npractice, if piles of crepe rubber are allowed to remain for any\r\nappreciable period before hanging to dry. For this reason batches of wet\r\ncrepe should always be placed on edge, to allow free drainage of surface\r\nmoisture, if the rubber cannot be taken at once to the drying-sheds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE SPECIMENS OF FINE PALE CREPE SUFFERING FROM \"SPOT\"\r\nDISEASE.]\r\n\r\nThe condition also is provided if the thickness of the crepe is\r\nexcessive. In some factories, having no smooth-roll finishing machines, the\r\ncrepes may have a distinct raised pattern upon them. It is usual to note\r\nthat if \"spot\" disease appears in such crepes, it is incident to much\r\ngreater degree in the thicker portions of the rubber--_i.e._, upon the\r\nraised pattern.\r\n\r\nThe direct connection between the rate of drying and the appearance of\r\ncoloured spots or flushes is thus established, and it only remains to adopt\r\nprecautionary measures which will lead to an avoidance of delay (1) between\r\nmachining and hanging, (2) in drying.\r\n\r\nIt is indicated, therefore, that, if spot disease is to be avoided, the\r\nprime consideration is the preparation of a thin crepe which will dry\r\nquickly under average conditions. It may sometimes happen that even very\r\nthin crepes will sometimes be found affected on some estates. In such\r\ninstances, it will be found that the design or situation of the\r\ndrying-house is at fault, and that specially favourable conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of the fungi have been created by excessively wet weather.\r\nShould the trouble persist in spite of the preparation of the thinnest\r\ncrepe, it would be advisable either to abandon this form of No. 1 product\r\nor to consider the installation of artificial aids to drying.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet encountered any case in which it was found necessary to\r\ntreat the latex with an antiseptic or disinfectant substance for the\r\nprevention of \"spot\" disease. There appears to be an idea held in some\r\nquarters that sodium bisulphite may be so employed as a fungicide. This\r\ndoes not agree with our experience, which is confirmed by Sharpies\r\n(Bulletin No. 19, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture).\r\n\r\nIn 1913 experiments with chinosol were undertaken at the Pataling\r\nLaboratory of the Rubber Growers' Association, and an account of the method\r\nof treatment was given in a printed report issued to subscribers. Dr. P.\r\nArens,[20] of the Malang Experimental Station (Java), has also recommended\r\nthe use of chinosol. The substance is expensive, but is effective in very\r\nsmall quantity. On the whole, given average conditions in factory practice,\r\nsuch aids should not be necessary, and where keen supervision is not\r\navailable may lead to other difficulties.\r\n\r\n[20] \"Guide to the Preparation of Rubber,\" Arens, 1918; Communications from\r\nthe Experimental Station (Malang, Java).\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that it is possible for \"spot\" disease to\r\ndevelop in dry rubber which previously gave no evidence of the presence of\r\nfungi. The condition necessary to such an occurrence is supplied by the\r\npresence of moisture. Thus, to state instances which are by no means\r\nuncommon, if a box of rubber is allowed to remain exposed to rain, or is\r\ndamaged by flood-water, or by sea-water during transit, or (sometimes) if\r\nthe rubber is packed in a damp case, the crepe on arrival at its\r\ndestination may be found to be affected to a degree dependent upon the\r\nextent of wetting and the duration of the wetting period.\r\n\r\nNo means are known by which these coloured spots, due to the growth of\r\nchromogenic organisms, can be removed from the rubber. Naturally, although\r\nthey may be present in the darker lower grades of crepe, they are not so\r\neasily visible as in pale crepe. It follows, therefore, that every possible\r\nprecautionary measure must be taken when pale crepe has to be prepared.\r\n\r\nWe are often asked whether it is possible for an infected piece of rubber\r\nto affect sound rubber hanging in the same building; and whether, in case\r\nof \"spot\" disease appearing, it is necessary to disinfect the drying-house.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, the answer to both queries is in the negative. It has\r\nnot been proved possible to transmit the disease from one piece of crepe to\r\nanother, except by the closest possible contact and in the presence of an\r\nabundance of moisture.\r\n\r\nA dry crepe, even when in close contact with an infected dry specimen, has\r\nnot been found to be affected.\r\n\r\nUnless, therefore, pieces of rubber are pressed together, under favourable\r\nconditions as to moisture, there has been observed no transfer of disease.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it has not been found that the presence of spotted rubber in one\r\npart of the drying-house has been responsible for an outbreak of disease\r\nin another part of the same building. Furthermore, after the removal of\r\ndiseased rubber from the drying-shed, freshly prepared rubber may be hung\r\non the same supports without becoming affected, and without any\r\nintermediate treatment of the wooden bars, providing the crepe is thin and\r\nweather conditions are good. In our experience, no case has been observed\r\nin which the disease has been communicated to freshly prepared rubber by\r\nreason of the previous presence of affected rubber. In our opinion,\r\ntherefore, any scheme for disinfecting the interior of a drying-house, as a\r\npreventive measure against the spread of \"spot\" disease, is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAll other things being equal, it is plain that much will depend, as to the\r\nincidence of coloured spots, upon the design and situation of the\r\ndrying-house. Sufficient has been written in previous chapters to indicate\r\nthe importance of these points as affecting the rate of drying, upon which\r\nhinges the possibility of the appearance of \"spot\" disease.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the chief points in any discussion of this subject may be\r\nsummarised thus:\r\n\r\n     1. No coagulum should be left without working for longer than the\r\n     ordinary period. Otherwise, the prevailing conditions are very\r\n     favourable for the development of the disease.\r\n\r\n     2. Thin crepe only should be made. The quicker the rate of drying the\r\n     less possibility is there of the coloured spots appearing.\r\n\r\n     3. Crepe should never be allowed to remain folded overnight, and\r\n     batches of folded wet crepe should be placed on edge to drain off\r\n     surface moisture. The rubber should be hung to dry as soon as\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n     4. Several species of fungi causing coloured spots have been\r\n     recognised, and it has been proved conclusively that it is possible to\r\n     infect latex and also fresh coagulum.\r\n\r\n     5. As far as our present knowledge goes, it appears that infection\r\n     takes place chiefly, if not entirely, by means of the latex in the\r\n     field-vessels. It may take place during transport also, or even during\r\n     coagulation.\r\n\r\n     6. While it is certain that infection can be caused by contact, it has\r\n     not yet been shown that infection of the finished wet rubber takes\r\n     place in the drying-houses by means of air-borne spores--at least,\r\n     under ordinary drying conditions.\r\n\r\n     7. There is reason to believe that no further infection takes place\r\n     once the rubber is well into the drying stage, and that dry rubber is\r\n     not infected even by contact. From this one might infer that, as long\r\n     as rubber remains dry, infection cannot take place during the voyage\r\n     to the port of consignment.\r\n\r\n     8. Coloured spots do not appear until the rubber is about half dry,\r\n     because that period is necessary for the development of the fungus to\r\n     that stage in its life-history when it excretes colouring matter. The\r\n     fungus in its earlier and colourless stage may have been present from\r\n     the time the latex entered the cup.\r\n\r\n     9. The natural habitat of the fungi would appear to be decaying\r\n     vegetable matter in the field.\r\n\r\n     10. Finally, if it is found impossible to be rid of fungoid-spot\r\n     disease after having exercised all care and observed all known\r\n     precautions, nothing remains but to supersede the ordinary drying\r\n     process by some system of quick drying, such as the vacuum-drying\r\n     process or a hot-air draught system, in which the rubber dries so\r\n     quickly that any possibility of appearance of \"spots\" is entirely\r\n     removed.\r\n\r\nSURFACE MOULDS OR MILDEWS ON CREPE RUBBER.--Defects of this nature are most\r\nuncommon in the higher grades of crepe rubber, but cases of affection in\r\nthe lower grades are not rare.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident from all previous discussions that the incidence of\r\nthese moulds must be due to an extremely slow rate of drying. The necessary\r\nconditions would be supplied by one or more of the following causes:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Making the crepe too thick.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Hanging the crepe in a badly ventilated or badly situated\r\n     building.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Occasionally by abnormally wet weather.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Allowing piles of crepe to remain too long before hanging.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Using excessive quantities of deteriorated sodium bisulphite. In\r\n     short, any factor contributing towards a retarded rate of drying may\r\n     be responsible for the appearance of surface mildews. The last\r\n     mentioned cause is of not infrequent occurrence. Knowing the chemical\r\n     to be of poor quality, relatively more is used to produce the desired\r\n     anti-oxidant effect. Unless the rubber is particularly well washed on\r\n     the rolls, there remains within it a residue of sodium _bisulphate_,\r\n     an oxidation product of the bisulphite. This is hygroscopic to some\r\n     degree--_i.e._, it takes up moisture from the atmosphere. Hence\r\n     drying is delayed, and even should mildews not develop the chemical\r\n     may sometimes be seen on the surface of the rubber as a whitish\r\n     \"bloom.\"\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of the possible causes of mildews on crepe rubber is\r\nsufficient to indicate the necessary precautions to be taken, and the\r\ndiscussion will not be extended further.\r\n\r\nTACKINESS IN RUBBER.--\"Tackiness\" is a term used to denote a deterioration\r\nof rubber which renders it sticky, and, beyond this, implies that some\r\nphysical and chemical change in the nature of the substance has taken\r\nplace. In fact, it is no longer \"rubber,\" but an oxidation product\r\ncontaining much resinous matter. It does not behave as rubber, and hence\r\nits value is much depreciated.\r\n\r\nWith modern ideas of erection of factories to guard against the\r\nintroduction of direct sunlight, it was hoped that this defect had\r\npractically ceased to exist. In one grade of rubber it would be expected\r\nthat tackiness would continue to appear. Earth-rubber, often exposed to\r\ndirect sunlight for a week, would naturally become tacky, and this\r\ntackiness cannot be avoided unless the earth-scrap is to be collected more\r\nfrequently. But in many cases even the higher grades of rubber show signs\r\nof tackiness. Experiments have been carried out at various times and in\r\nvarious places to determine the cause of tackiness. For some time the\r\ntheory of bacterial origin was in favour, but none of the experimental\r\nresults was convincing. Bacteria may be present in tacky rubber; but, on\r\nthe other hand, many cases of bacteria in rubber have been observed in\r\nwhich there was no tackiness. Experiments were made by one of us some years\r\nago with a view to testing the bacterial theory by inoculating latex with\r\nsmall pieces of tacky rubber. In opposition to the results which were\r\nstated to have been obtained, there was no spread of tackiness. Other\r\ninvestigators have obtained similar results. One writer proposed to explain\r\ntackiness as caused by excess of moisture. This perfectly simple\r\nexplanation unfortunately displays only a profound ignorance of the\r\nsubject, and does not take into account the fact that tackiness is incident\r\nin rubber after dryness has been reached. It need not be pointed out to\r\nplanters in Malaya that wet sheets of rubber are often exposed to direct\r\nsunlight by workers of native holdings, with no resulting harm as long as\r\nplenty of moisture is present in the rubber.\r\n\r\nTACKINESS THE RESULT OF A SLOW PROCESS OF CHANGE.--As stated above,\r\ntackiness does not appear until the rubber is dry, and even then it is to\r\nbe noted that it is possible for tackiness to appear in rubber arriving in\r\nLondon, which showed no indications of tackiness when packed for shipment.\r\n\r\nTACKINESS CAUSED BY TRACES OF COPPER SALTS.--Spence, as the result of\r\ninvestigations, has pointed out that none of the various theories put\r\nforward to account for tackiness--viz., the action of bacteria, premature\r\nputrefaction, oxidation, excess of moisture, the action of enzymes,\r\netc.--have any basis in scientific proof, and believes that the cause of\r\ntackiness cannot be directly attributed to bacteria. It has been stated\r\nthat the only known way of causing rubber to become tacky is to expose it\r\nto sunlight or heat. While agreeing that in the ordinary way this statement\r\nis correct as far as one rules out the employment of chemical substances,\r\nit must be pointed out that tackiness of the worst degree may be caused by\r\nthe presence of traces of copper or copper salts. This point has already\r\nbeen touched upon in a preceding paragraph dealing with the defect of\r\n\"green streaks\" in pale crepe rubber.\r\n\r\nIn the course of laboratory experiments tackiness has often been induced by\r\nthe use of traces of copper salts. The rate at which tackiness is induced\r\nappears to be dependent upon the amount of copper salt used, but once it\r\nbegins, the rubber molecule is very rapidly broken down, and resins are\r\nformed. As the formation of resins is accompanied by the inclusion of\r\noxygen in the chemical constitution, it would be expected that dry rubber\r\nbecoming tacky should increase in weight. This is found to be the case, and\r\nto give an idea of how this weight increases with the progress of\r\ntackiness, the results below may be studied.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the maximum quantity of copper sulphate used amounted\r\nto 0.025 per cent, (approx.) upon the weight of latex taken. Now it is\r\nhighly probable that only a fraction of this quantity was retained in the\r\nrubber on coagulation, the remainder being in solution in the serum.\r\nFurthermore, as the rubber was well washed and worked down to thin crepe,\r\n_the total quantity of copper salt remaining in the dry crepe must have\r\nbeen exceedingly small_. Yet the effect is most marked and should impress\r\nupon all managers the necessity for guarding against any possible\r\ncontamination caused by brass or copper.\r\n\r\n  ----------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------\r\n  _Sample._ |                 |             _Weight of Rubber._\r\n     +------+                 +------+--------+--------+--------+----------\r\n     |                        |      | After  |Further |Further | Percent-\r\n     |_Amount of Copper Salt._| When |Interval|Interval|Interval|age in In-\r\n     |                        | Dry. |of Four |of Seven|of Three|crease in\r\n     |                        |      | Weeks. | Weeks. | Weeks. | Weight.\r\n  ---+------------------------+------+--------+--------+--------+----------\r\n     |                        | Grms.| Grms.  | Grms.  |  Grms. |\r\n   1 |0.02 grms. copper       |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |sulphate per 100 c.c.   | 430  |  441   |  482   |  488   |   13.5\r\n     |latex                   |      |        |        |        |\r\n   2 | Ditto                  | 428  |  439   |  481   |  486   |   13.55\r\n   3 |0.01 grms. copper     } |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |sulphate, per 100 c.c.} |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |latex                 } | 962  |  987   | 1035   | 1036   |    7.7\r\n     |0.01 grms. copper     } |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |acetate, per 100 c.c. } |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |latex                 } |      |        |        |        |\r\n   4 |0.025 grms. copper      |      |        |        |        |\r\n     |sulphate, per 100 c.c.  | 502  |  513   |  558   |  560   |   11.5\r\n     |latex                   |      |        |        |        |\r\n  ---+------------------------+------+--------+--------+--------+----------\r\n\r\nIn view of the effect thus produced by the addition of traces to latex of a\r\ncopper salt, and the observed effect on rubber of contact with copper\r\nsalts, one may imagine the result produced some years ago when on an estate\r\nsmoked sheets were washed with a solution of copper sulphate as a remedy\r\nfor surface moulds!\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this chemical action we know of no other means by\r\nwhich tackiness is produced, beyond those of direct sunshine and heat.\r\nCases governed by these two causes are common on estates. They are confined\r\nchiefly to the lowest grades of scrap rubber, when the component raw\r\nmaterials have been exposed to the sun for a period before being brought to\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nIt is now comparatively rare to find cases of tackiness in the higher\r\ngrades of crepe, and when they occur, one may look for evidence of gross\r\ncarelessness in the admission of direct sunshine. Usually this means the\r\nfailure of some individual to regulate window shutters according to the\r\nposition of the sun in the sky. More rarely does it happen that tackiness\r\nmay have been induced by placing thin crepe rubber too near the iron roof\r\nof the drying-shed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question as to whether tackiness may be communicated by\r\ndirect contact, opinion appears to be divided. It has been stated that\r\nsound rubber left in contact with tacky specimens was found to be\r\nunaffected after two years. On the other hand, it is claimed that tackiness\r\nhas been induced in a sound rubber by infecting it with small pieces which\r\nwere tacky. In a preliminary article on the effect of copper and copper\r\nsalts upon pieces of dried and sound crepe[21] it was noted, after one\r\nyear, that tackiness had been communicated from the treated portion to the\r\n\"blank\" in contact. There is sufficient evidence to warrant the injunction\r\nthat tacky rubber should be excluded from contact with sound rubber. If\r\nshipped it should be packed separately.\r\n\r\n[21] Report I., 1916 (Sidney Morgan), Rubber Growers' Association (Malaya).\r\n\r\nCompounds have been put upon the market which assumedly claim to be cures\r\nfor tackiness. These are merely palliatives, consisting of starch, talc, or\r\nchalk powders, which counteract stickiness.\r\n\r\nNO CURE FOR TACKINESS.--At the present stage of our knowledge, there\r\nappears to be no cure for tackiness. Neither do we see the necessity for a\r\ncure when the phenomenon may be avoided by taking simple precautions, which\r\nmay be briefly summarised thus:\r\n\r\n     (1) Any permanent openings through which it is possible for direct\r\n     sunlight to enter, whether large or small, should either be totally\r\n     closed or provided with some substance which cuts off the direct\r\n     effect of the sunlight--_e.g._, ruby glass or ruby glazed cloth.\r\n\r\n     (2) Rubber should under no circumstances be placed near any source of\r\n     heat.\r\n\r\n     (3) No rubber should be hung in a drying-room in such a position\r\n     adjacent to a window or door that it is possible for sunshine to reach\r\n     it, even should coolies neglect to obey rules.\r\n\r\n     (4) Instruments or vessels of copper or brass should not be used where\r\n     acids are employed.\r\n\r\nLACK OF UNIFORMITY IN COLOUR.--The complaint is far less real than it was\r\na few years ago. The introduction by the Rubber Growers' Association of the\r\n\"Metrolac\" led to uniform dilution of latices varying in rubber content.\r\nPreviously the only known method of obtaining uniformity in colour and\r\nappearance was that by which latices from all fields were mixed together in\r\nbulk. Even so the uniformity applied only to the one bulking operation, and\r\nany other day's results might show considerable variation from the first\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nThis does not take into account any observed differences in shade of colour\r\nattributable to natural oxidation which might vary in intensity from day to\r\nday. The introduction of sodium bisulphite as an anti-oxidant exerted a\r\ngreat influence upon the colour of pale crepes generally; but considerable\r\nvariation would still have been notable but for the adoption of the scheme\r\nfor uniform dilution, in addition to the use of small quantities of\r\nanti-oxidant.\r\n\r\nOn most estates it is now possible, with slight exceptions due to abnormal\r\nconditions, so to treat the latex that the pale crepes prepared on any one\r\nday differ in no perceptible degree from the product of any other day.\r\nWhere this is not the case it must be suspected that there has been some\r\ncarelessness in manipulating the latex or the chemicals. Attention has been\r\ndrawn to the fact that there may be exceptional cases, when the determining\r\nfactors lie beyond the control of factory processes--_e.g._, heavy rains\r\ncausing over-dilution of latex, the yielding of \"yellow\" latex from newly\r\nopened areas, etc. But on the whole there is now no reason why the general\r\naverage product from any estate should not be uniform in colour and\r\nappearance. Furthermore, it should be possible for large groups of estates,\r\nby the adoption of uniform methods, to produce similar rubber from all the\r\nplantations. Moreover, apart from some differences caused by factors which\r\nstill need determination, the total product in a general sense should not\r\nonly be uniform in appearance but uniform in physical and chemical\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nBLOCK RUBBER.--This mode of preparation is employed only in comparatively\r\nfew instances. The block is prepared from crepe rubber, which has been\r\ndried either in a hot-air drier or in a vacuum chamber.\r\n\r\nThere is another type of block which is made by placing layers of dry crepe\r\nunder considerable pressure. This is not the true type of block, and the\r\nlayers are quite distinct--_i.e._, they do not amalgamate. Usually this\r\npressed rubber consists of lower grades of crepe, and it should not be\r\npopular, inasmuch as it leaves too wide an opportunity for the inclusion of\r\ndirt, bark particles, and other impurities, which cannot be seen generally\r\non account of the protective colour of the rubber.\r\n\r\nIn the true type of block, the layers are in a plastic condition, due to\r\nheat, when they leave the drying-chamber; and being immediately submitted\r\nto great pressure the result is a homogeneous mass in which the layers\r\ndisappear by amalgamation. Only the best grade of crepe is employed, and\r\ngiven the absence of defects in the layers there should be no complaint\r\nregarding the final block.\r\n\r\nPrepared in slabs which are three or four inches in thickness, the product\r\nis easily handled, and should be sufficiently translucent to make it\r\npossible to distinguish the shape of the hand when held between the block\r\nand the light. This is not possible when blocks are made of greater\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe only complaints which it should be possible to lodge against block\r\nrubbers are:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The inclusion of dirt and other matter.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The use of layers of crepe which have some defect.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The inclusion of air-bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for (_a_) and (_b_) lies in the hands of the factory\r\nsuperintendent. The last ground of complaint is dependent upon the style of\r\npreparation of the original layers of crepe.\r\n\r\nWhen layers of crepe are placed one upon the other, and submitted to great\r\npressure, it is natural to suppose that air would be contained in spaces,\r\nand would be unable to escape. To guard against this, it would seem\r\nnecessary to prepare the crepe thin and with a fairly good surface finish.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious to all acquainted with the processes involved in the\r\npreparation of block rubber, that no possibility exists for the presence\r\nof air-bells actually enclosed _in_ thin crepe. When the vacuum-dried crepe\r\nis folded preparatory to the blocking process it is apparent that between\r\nthe layers there must always be a considerable volume of air, a small\r\nproportion of which is bound to be retained owing to the nature of the\r\nsurface of crepe rubber.\r\n\r\nThat this has always been true of the preparation of block rubber cannot be\r\ndenied. It is possible, of course, for one type of block to show the\r\npresence of air-bells more than another type, the proportion of air\r\nenclosed in blocking depending upon the nature of the crepe of which the\r\nblock is composed. A block built up of layers of smooth, fine crepe would\r\nbe expected to contain less air-bells than a block composed of layers of a\r\nrough crepe.\r\n\r\nBlock rubber has been seen which was free from air-bells, but this was the\r\nthin variety of block prepared for show purposes with far greater care,\r\nprobably, than would be expended in commercial preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_DEFECTS IN SHEET RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to deal with defects in the rubber as it is put upon the\r\nmarket a brief account will be given of faults which may be noted in the\r\npreparatory stages.\r\n\r\nMILKY RESIDUE OR SERUM.--If the serum is not clear after the ordinary\r\nperiod allowed for coagulation, it indicates one of the following possible\r\ncauses:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Failure to obtain complete mixture by thorough stirring.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Insufficiency of acid solution. This may be real or indirectly\r\n     due to the presence of an excess of anti-coagulant such as formalin or\r\n     sodium sulphite.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) In cases where other coagulants than acetic or formic acids have\r\n     been employed the failure may be due to an excess of, or an\r\n     unsuitable, coagulant--_e.g._, hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nCOLOURED SURFACE BLOTCHES AND UNPLEASANT ODOUR.--Sometimes the surface of\r\nthe coagulum exhibits yellowish or bluish streaks and patches. It will be\r\nfound generally that the yellowish colour is possessed by a slimy\r\nsubstance, of offensive odour, which may be scraped from the surface.\r\nEither insufficient acid has been used, or the mixing of latex and\r\ncoagulant has been at fault.\r\n\r\nDARK DISCOLORATION OF THE RUBBER.--This may be stated to be a natural\r\nprocess when fresh rubber is exposed to the atmosphere. It is usually\r\ndescribed as \"oxidation,\" and it will be noted to be absent, or to occur to\r\nless degree, on those portions of the rubber which are protected from the\r\natmosphere by being below the surface of the remaining liquid. This surface\r\nchange may be prevented (see Chapters VIII. and IX.) by the use of small\r\nquantities of sodium sulphite (for preference) or bisulphite.\r\n\r\nSOFT COAGULUM, SPONGY UNDER-SURFACE, TEARING OF COAGULUM.--If the whole\r\nmass of coagulum is too soft, while coagulation appears to be complete,\r\nover-dilution of the latex has occurred. This may apply also to the case in\r\nwhich the under-surface only is spongy and soft. If coagulating-tanks are\r\nemployed, the upper edge may be comparatively hard, while the lower is soft\r\nand weak. Often the spongy portion may adhere to the partitions. This\r\nprevents the natural rise of the coagulum, due to retraction, as the mass\r\n\"sets.\" The pull between the free upper portion and the adhering lower edge\r\ncauses splitting and tearing of the coagulum, with marked porosity (spongy\r\nappearance). The two factors to receive attention are the standard of\r\ndilution and the condition of the surfaces of the partitions. If these have\r\nminute cracks into which latex can penetrate, and in which coagulation\r\ntakes place, the boards should be discarded. Given the conditions indicated\r\nabove, the tearing and splitting of rubber in coagulating tanks is\r\nsometimes augmented by the practice of flooding the tanks when coagulation\r\nis judged to be complete. The surface water finds its way downwards between\r\nstrips of coagulum and the partitions, thus increasing the upward tension\r\nbetween the free and adhering portions. The main idea governing the\r\npractice of flooding the tanks is to prevent \"oxidation\" (darkening) of the\r\nupper edges. If a small quantity of sodium sulphite is employed as an\r\nanti-oxidant and to retard coagulation, it is not necessary to flood tanks.\r\n\r\n\"PITTING\" OF SURFACES.--In pan coagulation this \"pitted\" appearance is\r\nusually limited to the under-surface, while coagulum prepared in tanks may\r\nexhibit the defect on both faces. The existence of these numerous \"pits,\"\r\nor small depressions, points to the presence of bubbles of gas which have\r\nbeen unable to escape freely. As the formation and retention of gas-bubbles\r\nis not a normal occurrence in coagulation, we are led to infer that some\r\nspecial conditions must have arisen. These may be supplied by one or more\r\nof the following contributory causes:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The latex had begun to \"sour\" before arrival at the factory or\r\n     while waiting to be treated. This premature coagulation is usually\r\n     checked or diminished by the employment of anti-coagulants (see\r\n     Chapters VIII. and IX.). It is generally accompanied by the\r\n     appearance of enclosed gas-bubbles in the dry rubber.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) There may have been a slight insufficiency of coagulant, or the\r\n     admixture was not thorough, thus allowing a slow putrefactive change\r\n     to take place in the incompletely coagulated areas.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The wooden partitions may not have been effectively cleansed.\r\n     The existence of a thin slime, of bacterial origin, is sometimes\r\n     noted. This is accountable for putrefactive effects in the surfaces of\r\n     the coagulum, or in the serum, giving rise to the formation of gases.\r\n     If these cannot escape freely, by reason of adhesion between the\r\n     coagulum and the partitions, \"pitting\" occurs.\r\n\r\nTHICKENED ENDS OR EDGES, AFTER ROLLING.--As a rule these defects may be\r\nascribed to the employment of too rich a latex, or faulty manipulation.\r\nEven if the standard of dilution should be correct it sometimes happens\r\nthat, in the preliminary rolling of a long strip of rubber, coolies begin\r\nin the middle, rolling with a forward pressure and tension towards the ends\r\nof the strip. This is generally not so much the fault of the coolie as\r\nbeing due to the lack of proper facilities for preliminary rolling. The\r\ntable should be about 3 feet in height, so that ease of working is obtained\r\nmerely by natural pressure due to the position in which the worker stands.\r\nThe use of a heavy wooden roller would contribute towards this result,\r\ninasmuch as it obviates the use of force, and the pressure is almost\r\nentirely in a vertical direction.\r\n\r\nMIS-SHAPEN SHEETS.--It is sometimes noted that sheets may be wider and\r\nthicker at the ends than in the middle. Manipulation alone, as indicated\r\nabove, is not solely responsible. The primary cause is to be traced to\r\nover-dilution of latex, giving a very soft coagulum which responds too\r\nreadily to tension and pressure. Faulty treatment in rolling exaggerates\r\nthe tendency for the strip of sheet to become narrow and thin in the\r\nmiddle, wider and thicker at the ends.\r\n\r\nTHICKENED PATCHES, TORN SHEETS, \"DOG-EARS,\" CREASES.--These elementary\r\ndefects are all due to careless working. While occasional errors cannot be\r\navoided, there is no real excuse for the continuance of trouble to any\r\ndegree, under average supervision.\r\n\r\nThickened patches are often caused in conjunction with torn sheets, and\r\nthe trouble may be ascribed to faulty practice in allowing too heavy a pile\r\nof wet strips to accumulate before machining. Or a comparatively small pile\r\nmay have been transported some distance. It is difficult to separate the\r\nstrip, and occasionally the separation is only effected at the expense of\r\ntwo sheets, one of which is torn and the other has a portion of the first\r\nstrip adhering to it.\r\n\r\n\"Dog-ears\" due to the folding over of corners of the sheets, and creases\r\ndue to the rumpling of the coagulum, are generally the result of haste and\r\nlack of average care. Machine coolies, more often than not, will not be at\r\nany pains to straighten out folds before passing the coagulum through the\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\nGREASINESS BEFORE SMOKING.--Under ordinary methods of working this should\r\nnever be encountered. It may be taken to show that the machined rubber has\r\nbeen allowed to remain, either hanging or in piles, far too long before\r\nentering the smoke-house. The appearance is most marked if the rubber has\r\nremained in a cool and moist atmosphere--_e.g._, if it has been hanging\r\nover-night in a closed and badly-ventilated factory. In a marked degree\r\nthis is to be observed in the preparation of air-dried sheets, unless they\r\nare exposed, when freshly prepared, to the action of the sun for a period.\r\nThis period, in the case of rubber prepared on native small-holdings,\r\ngenerally extends over several days--until the sheets are more than half\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of smoked sheet, the greasy appearance and the cause\r\noutlined contribute to a defect which is eventually described as\r\n\"stretching rusty.\"\r\n\r\nSURFACE BLEMISHES.--The coagulum, during coagulation and subsequently, can\r\nbe contaminated in various ways. In most cases a little intelligence or\r\nincreased care would prevent the occurrence of these defects.\r\n\r\nWhen the coagulum remains over-night, in the absence of a cover, it is not\r\nuncommon to note the presence of dirt (from the roof above, or blown in\r\nfrom the outside), the droppings of mice and rats, flies and small insects.\r\nIn theory these should be seen and removed by the factory hands. In\r\npractice, except while under immediate supervision, the extraneous matter\r\nis often rolled into the soft coagulum.\r\n\r\nA fairly common cause of this surface contamination is the exhaust from the\r\npower-unit; generally the worst offender is a steam-engine. Grit and smuts\r\ncontinually find their way into the factory, alighting on the tables, in\r\nthe latex, in the water, and on the freshly prepared rubber. They are\r\nrolled into the soft rubber and lead to marked depreciation in the selling\r\nvalue. The radical remedy seems obvious, but is often beset with many\r\ndifficulties not unconnected with financial considerations.\r\n\r\nOther superficial blemishes, such as those due to the presence of rust\r\nmarks, oil or grease patches, etc., are self-explanatory, if a little\r\nthought is brought to bear upon them; and it is not proposed here to\r\ndiscuss such defects more fully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now dealt with certain defects which are visible in wet rubber, we\r\ncome to the discussion of others which are only perceptible either during\r\nor after the drying period. As far as is known no plantations of any size\r\nnow prepare sheets other than in the form of smoke-dried rubber, with the\r\nexception of a few which make a special form of thick and partially\r\nair-dried product known as \"slab\" rubber.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed, therefore, to treat in any detail with air-dried sheet\r\nrubber. Certain obvious defects are common to both air-dried and\r\nsmoke-cured sheets, and these will be first discussed.\r\n\r\nUNEVENNESS OF APPEARANCE.--This lack of uniformity may refer either to size\r\nor colour, or to both. Apart from any other contributory causes, this\r\nvariation is due, in pan sheet, to a neglect to standardise the dilution of\r\nall latices, or to lack of uniformity in the quantity of standardised latex\r\nplaced in each receptacle.\r\n\r\nWhere tanks are employed all sheets from the same tank should be of the\r\nsame size before rolling, and any subsequent disparity in thickness and\r\nlength must be attributed to some alteration in the width of the gap\r\nbetween the rolls of the machines.\r\n\r\nUnless all latices are standardised by means of an instrument, it is of\r\ncourse probable that the content of one tank may be found to differ from\r\nthat of another.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, whether air-dried or smoke-cured sheets are considered,\r\na thin strip will dry more quickly than a thick one, and should be paler in\r\ncolour when viewed by transmitted light--_i.e._, when the rubber is held\r\nbetween the eye and the source of light.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to guard against the possibility of variations\r\nin thickness caused by faulty manipulation. The distance between the\r\nsqueezing rolls (smooth) and between the marking rolls (patterned) should\r\nbe adjusted and should remain set until the conclusion of work. In a\r\nfactory having nothing beyond average requirements in equipment of machines\r\nit should not be necessary to have to interrupt the work of the smooth\r\nrolls or \"markers\" by having to make adjustments. This is, however,\r\ninevitable if there is only one smooth-roll machine, as it is always\r\ndesirable to reduce the thickness of the coagulum by at least two stages\r\nthrough even-speed smooth rolls. In some factories there are three light\r\npower-driven smooth-roll machines, the gaps between pairs of rolls being\r\nset so as to obtain a gradual thinning effect upon the fresh coagulum,\r\nwhich is then passed once between patterned rolls. With such equipment it\r\nis found possible, in some cases, to omit the preliminary hand-rolling, and\r\nthe strips of coagulum from the tank are passed direct through rolls set\r\nwith a wide gap. This work demands much care, as it is necessary to avoid\r\nany distortion of the coagulum which may be caused by its own weight and\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nVARIATION DUE TO OXIDATION.--The subject of oxidation has been mentioned in\r\nthe opening paragraphs of this chapter. It will have been learned that\r\noxidation is a natural process, and that it may be prevented by the\r\nemployment of anti-oxidants such as the sulphite or bisulphite of soda. In\r\nearlier days it was sometimes prevented by steeping the thin rubber in very\r\nhot water.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of an anti-oxidant the degree of oxidation may vary daily\r\nand in different batches of latex on any one day, so that there is always\r\nthe possibility of a lack of uniformity due to oxidation effects. This\r\nwould be more evident in air-dried sheets than in smoke-cured rubber, as in\r\nthe latter case the darkening of the surface would be masked by the colour\r\ninduced by the smoke-drying process.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this variation anti-oxidants are used on most estates, but the\r\naccidental or misinformed abuse of these chemicals may lead to further lack\r\nof uniformity. Hence it is necessary to follow carefully the formulae\r\nprescribed by experience.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF SMOKED SHEETS.--It may be of interest to note that the effect\r\nknown as oxidation is attributed to the presence of micro-organisms called\r\nenzymes (ferments) in the latex. It can also be produced artificially in\r\nvarious ways--_e.g._, by the use of the crude product of wood-distillation\r\n(pyroligneous acid) as a coagulant, or by the addition to the latex of\r\nsmall quantities of a phenol such as carbolic acid. It is thus possible to\r\nprepare in sheet form a rubber which has the appearance of having been\r\nsmoke-cured, although it may never have been in a smoke-house.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear, therefore, that apart from other causes, the colour of\r\nthe cured sheets may be influenced by oxidation of the fresh coagulation,\r\nand by the constituents of the smoke. It follows that the smoke from\r\ntimbers which are richer than others in certain chemical bodies set free by\r\ncombustion will produce a rubber darker in colour.\r\n\r\nThere is thus no real connection between colour and period of cure,\r\nalthough in a general sense the longer the interval the darker the colour.\r\n\r\nSimilarly it is now plain that when anti-oxidants are employed in excess\r\nthe paleness of the rubber is in no degree truly indicative of the period\r\nduring which the rubber has been smoke-cured.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the effect of the hypsical condition of the wet rubber\r\nupon the final colour must be thoroughly grasped. One may take two sheets\r\nof apparently the same thickness, and smoke-cure them in juxtaposition\r\nwithin the same house, only to find that one dries much more rapidly than\r\nthe other. As a consequence, the first, when fully cured, will be of a\r\nmedium golden brown colour; while the other, owing to protracted smoking,\r\nwill be dark. Evidently there must be some distinct difference between the\r\ntwo in physical condition prior to the smoking. Here the factor involved is\r\nthe rubber-content of the latex. Given two pieces of coagulum of identical\r\nthickness, but prepared from latices of different dry rubber content, it\r\nwill be obvious that to reduce them to similar thickness, more pressure\r\nwill be necessary in one case--_i.e._, that piece of coagulum will be much\r\nmore dense (more consolidated)--while the other will be comparatively soft\r\nand porous. Into the latter warm smoke can penetrate much more easily, and\r\nthe internal moisture can escape more rapidly. The full cure may be made,\r\nsay, within twelve days, while the tougher sheet may demand up to twenty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nTo attain uniformity in colour, therefore, the following points must be\r\nstudied and controlled as far as is possible:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Uniform dilution of all latices.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Uniform dimensions of coagulating receptacles.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Uniform volumes of standardised latex.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Uniform quality and quantities of chemicals.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Uniform methods of manipulating the coagulum.\r\n\r\n     (_f_) Uniform conditions of fuel and accommodation during\r\n     smoke-curing.\r\n\r\nSURFACE GLOSS.--In the choice of fuel there is room for control if one has\r\ngood timber available. This point opens up a discussion on the vexed\r\nquestion of \"over-smoking,\" as the term is sometimes applied to a\r\npronounced dry glossy appearance of the surface of sheets.\r\n\r\nThree main factors are involved:\r\n\r\n     (1) The nature of the fuel.\r\n\r\n     (2) The ratio between furnace capacity and the capacity of the\r\n     smoke-house.\r\n\r\n     (3) The rate of combustion.\r\n\r\n     Obviously any fuel which yields an excessive quantity of tarry matter\r\n     or creosotic substance would conduce to the formation of a heavy glaze\r\n     on the rubber. Such fuel, therefore, should at most only be employed\r\n     as the smaller portion in a mixture with \"dead\" timber.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to lay down any general rules for the guidance of estates,\r\nas the timber available varies so widely in nature. Experience must be the\r\nonly guide, and it should not be difficult to obviate the defect. Even so,\r\nthere must be minor differences between the results obtained on estates, so\r\nthat it is not possible to make strict estimations of the smoke-curing\r\nperiod by an examination of the surface appearance of rubber, even under\r\nthe best of conditions. Some estates find that the rubber has a distinct\r\ngloss in ten days, while others may smoke-cure for twice that period\r\nwithout difficulty. Evidently, therefore, the question of available fuel is\r\nof prime importance. It may be remarked that very satisfactory results are\r\nalways obtained from the use of fairly dry timber obtained from thinned\r\nrubber trees, mixed with the \"dead\" timber of old logs and stumps found on\r\nthe estates.\r\n\r\nObviously if a smoke-house has a superabundance of furnaces, producing more\r\nheat and smoke than is required, glazing will result. The point is tested\r\nby the average temperature maintained and the average rate of drying. The\r\nresult of a high temperature would be the possibility of volatile tarry\r\nmatter being driven in excess to the upper chamber. That this effect is\r\neventually produced even at optimal temperatures is evident from an\r\nexamination of the wood-work within the upper room.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, also, that the rate of combustion exerts an influence. In a\r\ngeneral sense a rapid consumption of fuel would augment the quantity of\r\ntarry matter passing into the upper chamber over any given period, and the\r\npossibility of glazing would be increased.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is possible that a surface glaze might be formed if\r\nthe temperature were uniformly too low, especially if the rubber were\r\nrather thick. The rate of drying would be so slow, that if a timber rich in\r\ntarry matter were employed, the rubber might be exceedingly glossy.\r\n\r\nIn order to guard against the appearance of a heavy glaze, then, the\r\nfollowing points must be observed:\r\n\r\n     1. The fuel must be carefully selected by experience.\r\n\r\n     2. The sheets must not be thick. No sheets should be thicker than 1/8\r\n     inch measured in average section across the ribs.\r\n\r\n     3. The temperature must not be too high. An average working\r\n     temperature of 120 deg. to 125 deg. F. should be ample.\r\n\r\n     4. If the sheets are fairly thick, a low average temperature should be\r\n     avoided. No lower average than 110 deg. F. should be allowed.\r\n\r\nDULL, BLACK SURFACE.--This is the opposite of the previous case, and\r\ngenerally is accompanied by a fairly heavy darkening of the surface due to\r\n\"oxidation\" effects. The fuel used is too \"dead,\" and needs the addition of\r\nsome substance containing a fair amount of creosotic matter. The appearance\r\nof the rubber does not justify the assumption that it has been over-smoked.\r\nAs a matter of fact, this type of rubber often becomes affected by mildew\r\nfairly rapidly, thus showing that the smoking has been inefficient.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that an estate is in the habit of using a fuel which gives\r\neven to a thin sheet a heavy glaze in a comparatively brief period. The\r\ngeneral custom is to soak such sheets in cold water, and then to scrub the\r\nsurfaces, sometimes using soap, in order to cleanse the rubber and free it\r\nfrom the glaze. This operation may be done too well, in which case the\r\nrubber will have a dull appearance, and may be rather more liable to\r\ndevelop surface mildew after a time.\r\n\r\nMOIST GLAZE, GREASINESS OF SURFACE.--This describes the condition of sheet\r\nrubber when taken from the smoke-house. Sometimes the greasiness does not\r\ndevelop until the rubber has been out of the smoke-house for a day or two.\r\n\r\nAs far as experience shows at present it may be due to two causes:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The use of an excess of sodium bisulphite or sodium sulphite.\r\n     The use of sodium bisulphite is not recommended generally for\r\n     sheet-making. It may cause the rubber to be too pale in colour, and\r\n     the abuse of it may delay the drying unduly. In the latter case, a\r\n     trace of the salt may remain within the rubber or upon the surface. If\r\n     so, as the substance remaining is fairly hygroscopic, it will take up\r\n     moisture from the atmosphere and may cause the surface of the sheets\r\n     to have a moist and shiny appearance. The moist surface deposit comes\r\n     away upon the hand when the sheets are touched, and is difficult to\r\n     remove entirely. On some estates a very small quantity of the\r\n     bisulphite is employed, as it is found to be of service in the\r\n     prevention of bubbles, but in unskilled hands the method is open to\r\n     abuse, and is, therefore, not recommended for general use.\r\n\r\n     A large number of estates now use sodium sulphite in very small\r\n     quantities as an anti-coagulant and a preservative for latex in the\r\n     field. The abuse of this very useful substance carries its own\r\n     penalty. The substance is hygroscopic; and if an excess is present the\r\n     drying period will be protracted, and the sheets will have a very\r\n     moist surface film.\r\n\r\n     It may be found sometimes that only some of the sheets are affected.\r\n     This indicates that, whereas uniform quantities of a solution of\r\n     sodium sulphite have been served out in all fields, the proportion may\r\n     have been excessive in the case of fields giving a latex of\r\n     comparatively low rubber content. What suits the latex from old trees\r\n     may be excessive probably for the latex of younger trees. This is not\r\n     an infallible rule, as in the case of older fields in which immature\r\n     bark is being tapped, it is to be noted that the dry rubber content of\r\n     latex may be less than that of latex obtained from younger trees.\r\n\r\n     This type of moist glaze is not easy to remove. Ordinary surface\r\n     washing had but a temporary effect, and the trouble recurs. The only\r\n     way of dealing with the difficulty is to soak the sheets for days in\r\n     running water (or in successive changes of water) and to re-smoke\r\n     until dry.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The second type of moist glaze is not so difficult to deal with,\r\n     and may be removed as a rule by washing the sheets when the rubber is\r\n     otherwise apparently dry.\r\n\r\n     It appears to be mainly a matter of unsuitable fuel for smoking and of\r\n     failure to provide adequate ventilation. A large number of estates\r\n     have been \"thinning-out\" or are doing so systematically. The logs thus\r\n     obtained are often used as fuel in the very green stage. The smoke\r\n     thus generated must be moist, and if the building is entirely closed,\r\n     this moisture must be deposited eventually upon the rubber and racks.\r\n     Some estates have surmounted the difficulty by opening up the\r\n     roof-ridge slightly so as to allow the moisture to escape with some of\r\n     the smoke; but if the logs from rubber-trees are to be used, they\r\n     should be stacked in the sun for some time. Even then, preferably,\r\n     they should not be used alone. A judicious admixture of dead and\r\n     rotting jungle-timber appears to give very satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nVIRGIN SPOTS AND PATCHES.--If the description really indicates the defect\r\nit simply means that portions of the sheets are not dry. When cut they\r\nexhibit the typical whitish, opaque appearance described as \"virgin.\" It is\r\ndoubtful whether any rubber put upon the market as No. 1 product nowadays\r\ncan have this complaint levelled at it. In the extreme case it points to\r\ngross negligence on the part of the packer.\r\n\r\nSometimes what are taken to be small spots of \"virgin\" are really patches\r\nof tiny air or gas bubbles. The point can be easily determined by cutting\r\nthrough the patch and examining the cut edges.\r\n\r\nSURFACE MOULDS OR MILDEW.--During the last two years, complaints regarding\r\nthe incidence of \"mouldy rubber\" (_i.e._, relating chiefly to the presence\r\nof mildews on the surface) have become increasingly common.\r\n\r\nTo judge by the comments of producers, who as a rule never again see their\r\nrubber after it leaves the estate, one would infer that the defect is\r\nimaginary, and that the complaints are made solely with a view to\r\nrepudiation of contracts or the general cheapening of an article of\r\ncommerce. They can often point out, with a certain amount of truth, that\r\nthere has been no change in the methods of preparation or curing, and that\r\npreviously there were no complaints.\r\n\r\nIt is forgotten, however, that in former years the smaller output of rubber\r\nwas taken into consumption more rapidly than of recent years. That is to\r\nsay, the interval between smoke-curing and the employment of the rubber in\r\nthe manufacture of goods did not demand such a long period of storage.\r\nHence the effects of smoke-curing are now more likely to vanish.\r\n\r\nGoing still further back in the history of plantation rubber, we can point\r\nto the time when smoked sheets were allowed, or had, to remain in the\r\ncuring-sheds for very extended periods. Loose specimens of rubber prepared\r\nduring that decade still exhibit no signs of mildew growth.\r\n\r\nIn later years a demand arose for sheets paler in colour than the old type,\r\nand in order to meet that demand, a change had to be made in methods. This\r\nled to a system of working whereby it was possible to smoke-dry sheets\r\nthoroughly in from twelve to fourteen days. This interval was further\r\nreduced on many estates, until some were producing rubber which appeared to\r\nsatisfy all requirements after only five or six days' curing. This does not\r\nrefer to the case of estates having smoke-houses of \"continuous-working\"\r\ntype, but to those on which smoking was confined practically to the hours\r\nof night. Under former conditions of rate of production and consumption,\r\nthis short period of smoke-curing would possibly have been ample; but even\r\nthis is very doubtful, as often the rubber would not stand the relatively\r\nshort journey from the estate to Singapore without mildew-growth being\r\nincipient. We have often received specimens of rubber sent from estates for\r\ncriticism, and have noted that within a comparatively brief period mildew\r\nwas to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter resolves itself into a question of thorough efficiency of\r\nsmoking. This is not dependent on duration of smoking alone, but involves\r\nother factors, such as the kind of fuel employed, the rate of combustion of\r\nfuel, the average temperature sustained, the ventilation of the\r\nsmoke-house, and the situation of the building. Other occasional\r\ncontributory factors are contemporary adverse climatic conditions and the\r\npossible abuse of an anti-coagulant such as sodium sulphite.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that after a time, given suitable conditions involving\r\nthe presence of moisture, moulds may appear on sheets which were apparently\r\nfully smoke-cured, and that under the same conditions other and older\r\nsamples were unaffected. It is argued that the latter sheets had evidently\r\nbeen smoked more efficiently than the others. Hence it is fair to assume\r\nthat, except under very special conditions, which do not apply to the\r\nordinary procedure in the shipping, storage, and sale of rubber, moulds\r\nwill not develop upon sheets which have been properly smoked. The term\r\n\"properly smoked\" signifies efficient smoking for all practical purposes\r\nunder ordinary procedure, and implies or includes all the advantageous\r\nfactors which have been discussed or alluded to in preceding paragraphs.\r\n\r\nWithout discussing in wearisome detail conditions which may give rise to\r\nthe incidence of mildew on properly smoked rubber, it may be pointed out\r\nthat the following are favourable to the growth of moulds:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Storing sheets in a damp place before packing.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Packing sheets in wooden cases which are not thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Piling up cases of rubber in a badly ventilated store-room.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Placing the cases on a cement floor.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) Wetting of cases by sea-water or by rain during transport, etc.\r\n\r\nBLACK STREAKS, SPOTS OR PATCHES.--The origin of these is not difficult to\r\ntrace. They are caused by drippings from the roof, and contain condensation\r\nproducts from smoke plus moisture. The ventilation of the roof-ridge should\r\nreceive attention, and if the trouble persists it will be necessary to\r\nplace some absorbent screen below the sloping roof. Sackcloth is sometimes\r\nused, but leads to a worse state of affairs unless changed frequently. In\r\nmost modern smoke-houses having an iron roof there is an inner lining of\r\nsoft timber.\r\n\r\nThere scarcely seems a necessity to discuss the case in which an iron roof\r\nhas become perforated by the action of smoke. The remedy is too obvious to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nWHITISH OR GREY STREAKS.--This is a very uncommon defect, and is generally\r\nto be traced to a building in which fairly new galvanised sheets have been\r\nemployed. The zinc surface becomes oxidised, and the whitish powder which\r\nis formed \"flakes,\" or is carried away by drops of moisture condensing on\r\nthe surface of the iron sheets.\r\n\r\nRUST.--Sometimes if a sheet is stretched forcibly and allowed to retract\r\nquickly, the hitherto clear surface will be seen to be marred by a \"rusty\"\r\ndeposit. The rubber is then described as \"stretching rusty,\" and its value\r\nis depreciated.\r\n\r\nThis defect has caused more trouble during recent years than any other. It\r\nis not proposed here to argue the question as to whether the presence of\r\nthis film, which appears when some rubbers are stretched, is detrimental to\r\nthe physical qualities of the product on vulcanisation. With the mere\r\nstatement of opinion that it could do no apparent harm, we may pass to the\r\naspect of the case as it affects the buyer and consumer. If one were to\r\njudge by the attention drawn to the appearance of smoke sheet-rubber after\r\nit has been stretched and allowed to retract, one would imagine the defect\r\nto be of comparatively sudden and recent incidence. This is not so. The\r\npeculiarity must have existed for years, and perhaps became more marked as\r\nso many estates abandoned the former common practice of allowing varying\r\nquantities of water to be placed in the collecting cups. As the substances\r\nwhich cause the defect to be visible are partially soluble in water, it\r\nwould follow that when working with the very dilute latices which were\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier years of the plantation industry, the\r\nremaining liquid in the pan after coagulation would contain an appreciable\r\nquantity of soluble substances which would otherwise have been retained in\r\nthe coagulum.\r\n\r\nConversely, the richer the latex, the greater the percentage of protein\r\nmatter retained in the coagulum. In the case of very rich latex, it must be\r\nwithin the knowledge of every manager that the quantity of remaining liquid\r\nin the pans would be almost nil. We may assume that the greater part of\r\nthese soluble proteins would be enclosed in the structure of the rubber,\r\nbut as the fresh coagulum must retain a quantity of liquid amounting to\r\nfrom 60 to 70 per cent. by weight (we are now referring to rich latices),\r\nit follows that some of the soluble protein matter must be removed when the\r\ncoagulum is placed under pressure. Even after the pressure is released more\r\nof the contained liquid will exude from the surface of the rubber; and from\r\nexperience it is easy to imagine that this exudation, becoming\r\nprogressively feebler, will continue until the rubber begins to dry. Then,\r\nwith the evaporation of the surface moisture, the protein matter, either in\r\noriginal form or as a degradation product, remains on the surface of the\r\nrubber as a thin, solid film or crust. As drying continues, the interior\r\nmoisture escaping through the pores of the rubber evaporates, leaving\r\nbehind the substances hitherto held in solution. Should, however, the sheet\r\nbe thick and/or the temperature of drying low, the rubber may dry first on\r\nthe outside, forming a thin skin of dry rubber, which delays further drying\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that sheets which have been prepared from rich\r\nlatex or from too deep a layer of comparatively dilute latex will have a\r\nsurface film of dry protein matter. Moreover, these sheets will be slow in\r\ndrying, and in all probability will have a surface gloss and a dark colour.\r\nHence it is not difficult to understand that some brokers regarded the\r\npresence of the so-called \"rust\" as an indication of over-smoking.\r\n\r\nTo show that this is not so, and further that the presence of rust has\r\nnothing whatever to do with smoke-curing, it may be stated that _the\r\npresence of this protein film may be seen on unsmoked sheets_ which have\r\nbeen prepared from rich latex, from too deep a layer of more dilute latex,\r\nor from some thick sheets which have been rolled only very lightly. In\r\nfact, the presence of the protein film was noted on unsmoked sheet in 1910,\r\nwhen it was seen to resemble a thin yellowish glaze which could be scraped\r\noff with a pen-knife. Later, sufficient of this substance was removed from\r\nsome very thick air-dried sheets, or thin slabs, to fill a small test-tube.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheets were bent or twisted, the apparent surface of the rubber\r\n(_i.e._, the protein glaze) cracked in all directions. In the case of\r\nsheets prepared from less rich latex, the surface film naturally is\r\nextremely thin, and no cracking is observed.\r\n\r\nIf the fresh sheets are placed in a smoke-house, the drying film will take\r\nup colour from the constituents of the smoke, and it will be invisible.\r\nSomewhat analogous to the instance of a transparent glass giving a visible\r\nand opaque powder when crushed, so the transparent film on stretching\r\nbreaks up into a visible powder which is lighter in colour than the rubber\r\non which it is superimposed.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that since the introduction of standard methods of\r\npreparation, involving uniform dilution of latex, say, to a content of\r\n1-1/4 or 1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon, complaints as to \"rust\" have\r\ndecreased considerably.\r\n\r\nIt is to be further noted as a peculiar fact that while two estates may be\r\napparently working on identical lines, both as regards manipulation of\r\nlatex and subsequent treatment of the coagulum, the rubber of the one may\r\nalways be free from rust, while that of the other is often, if not always,\r\ncondemned for the alleged defect. Obviously, in such a case, there must be\r\nan initial difference between the two latices as regards the percentage of\r\nproteins present; or there must be some small unrecognised difference at\r\nsome stage of working.\r\n\r\nIt will now be clear that \"rust\" is caused by a film of matter which is\r\nformed on the surface of the pressed coagulum, being there deposited by the\r\nexudations from within the rubber and through the pores. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary to avoid any conditions which will favour the formation of this\r\ndeposit--_e.g._, allowing sheets to remain too long in a moist atmosphere\r\nbefore placing in the smoke-house.\r\n\r\nAt present there would seem to be only two methods which are successful in\r\nthe prevention of a \"rusty\" appearance in the dry rubber. Singularly\r\nenough, the two methods appear to be directly opposed in principle. They\r\nare:\r\n\r\n     A. THE HOT-WATER TREATMENT.--This method has been in constant use on\r\n     estates which have old trees giving rich latices. These latices are\r\n     always diluted to a uniform standard daily. Some estates which\r\n     formerly suffered from the defect now experience no difficulty, and in\r\n     other instances, where no complaint has yet been received, the\r\n     treatment has been followed consistently.\r\n\r\n     (1) After the sheets have been through the marking rolls, it is the\r\n     general custom to allow them to drip for about three hours. This\r\n     interval is really excessive for the mere draining away of the surface\r\n     water, but as a rule it is just sufficient to allow a portion of the\r\n     liquid retained in the rubber to exude. It has been shown that this\r\n     liquid may contain some protein matter in solution. Sometimes in the\r\n     case of thick sheets which have been subjected to pressure so much of\r\n     this matter is exuded as to form a thin surface slime which is\r\n     distinctly evident to the touch. If the sheets are allowed to hang\r\n     overnight, the presence of the exuded matter may be detected also by\r\n     its odour.\r\n\r\n     (2) Obviously, any method which will remove this surface film should\r\n     be of great benefit. It is found that the best results are obtained by\r\n     allowing sheets to drip for about two hours, and then placing them in\r\n     hot water for five or ten minutes. The water should be hot as the hand\r\n     can conveniently bear, and it need hardly be pointed out that the same\r\n     water should not be used for the whole day's output. For preference\r\n     there should be three or four vessels, each capable of holding a fair\r\n     proportion of the total number of sheets, and frequent changes of hot\r\n     water.\r\n\r\n     (3) After remaining in the hot water for the period mentioned, the\r\n     sheets are removed singly, each one being surface washed or swilled as\r\n     it is taken out.\r\n\r\n     (4) _It is important to see that the sheets are now well washed or\r\n     scrubbed under running cold water, or in frequent changes of water._\r\n     The reason for this procedure is plain. If the sheets are merely hung\r\n     again to drip after removing from the hot water, some moisture is\r\n     bound to remain on the surface of the sheet. As this surface moisture\r\n     contains some protein matter in solution, it is evident that, as the\r\n     water evaporates, the solid protein is again deposited on the surface\r\n     of the rubber. This would explain why some estates were unsuccessful\r\n     with the hot-water treatment. It is not essential that the running\r\n     water should be cold; it may be conveniently lukewarm if drawn from\r\n     the cooling tanks of the engines. But it is essential for the best\r\n     results that there should be running water, so that the substance in\r\n     solution is carried away. If the sheets are merely washed in a large\r\n     vessel, which has been filled with clean water, it must be obvious\r\n     that, by the time some scores of sheets have been washed, the protein\r\n     matter in solution on the surface of the sheets has been transferred\r\n     to the washing water, so that the later sheets of the batch are liable\r\n     to show the defect again on drying.\r\n\r\n     B. The second method is much more simple, and entails no extra labour\r\n     such as is demanded by the first method. A successful issue, however,\r\n     is rather more uncertain, and the method appears to give the best\r\n     results with sheet-rubber prepared on young estates or from more\r\n     dilute latex.\r\n\r\n     In this method, the sheets after rolling are allowed to drip for a\r\n     very short interval, so that the surface water is mainly removed. The\r\n     sheets are then placed in the smoke-house, and smoking is commenced at\r\n     once. In some cases where the defect had appeared continuously for a\r\n     long period, it was found to vanish entirely as soon as the method was\r\n     adopted; but when tried on some of the older estates, the results were\r\n     very doubtful, and a return was made to the hot-water treatment.\r\n\r\n     The explanation of the action which takes place is rather obscure, but\r\n     two theories may be advanced.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) It may be assumed that the interval given for dripping is too\r\n     brief to allow for the exudation of the internal moisture containing\r\n     dissolved protein matter.\r\n\r\n     In such case, the rubber is still in a highly porous condition, and it\r\n     might be advanced that the heat of the smoke may help to maintain that\r\n     condition. Thus the contained liquid might evaporate so quickly as to\r\n     leave behind the dissolved substances in the minute cellular structure\r\n     of the rubber. In other words, instead of the internal moisture\r\n     exuding slowly to the surface in liquid form, it may leave the\r\n     rubber, even in the first stages, in an evaporated condition, just as\r\n     it does in the subsequent stages of drying. Thus no dissolved protein\r\n     matter would be brought to the surface of the sheet and be deposited\r\n     there.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The other theory also demands the first assumption propounded in\r\n     the preceding theory, but subsequently perhaps is less feasible as it\r\n     assumes a chemical action of which we have no definite knowledge.\r\n\r\n     The idea is that as the rubber is in a porous condition, and is placed\r\n     quickly in an atmosphere of smoke, the heat may maintain that\r\n     condition to such a degree, that some constituents of the smoke may\r\n     enter the rubber and cause the precipitation _in situ_ of the protein\r\n     matter held in solution by the contained water or other liquid. The\r\n     contained liquid would be water which has in solution possibly a very\r\n     slight trace of the coagulant employed, of sugars, of protein matter,\r\n     and of inorganic salts. Of these the substances which would evaporate\r\n     would be probably the water and the coagulant in most cases. If a salt\r\n     had been used as a coagulant, the dissolved trace would be deposited\r\n     within the rubber in this case, whereas if a rich latex had been\r\n     employed or a thicker sheet made from more dilute latex, some of the\r\n     salt would be brought to the surface and there deposited together with\r\n     the protein matter. This has actually been experienced in practice,\r\n     and it has been possible to remove minute crystals from the edges of\r\n     the rubber so prepared.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that in order for either theory to contain an element of\r\nprobability, the rubber must be soft (porous) when placed in the\r\nsmoke-house, and must also be fairly thin. It is observed in all cases\r\nwhere the method has been successfully employed that both these conditions\r\nare generally fulfilled--at all events the rubber is fairly thin. When\r\nthicker sheets are made, either from rich latex or from a deeper layer of\r\ncomparatively dilute latex, the method is not uniformly successful.\r\n\r\nOTHER VIEWS ON \"RUST\" CAUSATION.--Later experimental work on \"rust\"\r\nformation by Hellendoorn[22] leads to the observation that \"rustiness\" is\r\ncaused, not actually by the deposition of original serum-substances, but by\r\nthe decomposition thereof, under the action of aerobic micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n[22] \"The Cause of Rustiness in Sheet-Rubber,\" H. J. Hellendoorn, Archief\r\nvoor de Rubbercultuur, October, 1919 (Communication from the Central Rubber\r\nStation, Buitenzorg, Java).\r\n\r\nWithout going into a full discussion of the subject, the following points\r\nnoted in the experimental work may be quoted:\r\n\r\n     1. Rustiness could apparently be produced at any time merely by\r\n     keeping freshly rolled sheets for periods varying from twenty-four to\r\n     forty-eight hours in a moist atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     2. Sheets placed immediately in a temperature of, say, 110 deg. to 130 deg. F.\r\n     never showed \"rust\"; but if air-dried at ordinary room temperature,\r\n     \"rust\" might appear.\r\n\r\n     3. \"Rust\" can be prevented by soaking freshly prepared sheets in\r\n     dilute solutions of disinfectants--_e.g._, formalin, sodium\r\n     bisulphite, or chinosol.\r\n\r\n     If subsequently the sheets are hung for any length of time in a moist\r\n     atmosphere, the protective effect of the disinfectant gradually\r\n     vanishes and \"rustiness\" may be produced.\r\n\r\n     The same disinfecting effect may be obtained by the use of steam or\r\n     hot water. It was found that there was less liability to the formation\r\n     of \"rust\" when sheets were immersed in water at a temperature of 95 deg.\r\n     to 120 deg. F., whilst steeping at 140 deg. F. gave complete freedom.\r\n\r\n     4. It was shown that the micro-organisms which cause decomposition of\r\n     the serum-products flourish only in the presence of air--_i.e._, they\r\n     are aerobic in character. It is not uncommon to find, therefore, that\r\n     \"rust\" may be incident only on those parts of a sheet which have been\r\n     exposed for some time to air and moisture before being placed in a\r\n     warm smoke-room.\r\n\r\n     5. The optimal temperature for development of the particular organisms\r\n     appeared to be about 100 deg. F., in a moist atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     6. Soaking the sheets in water (except the short immersion in hot\r\n     water, which we recommend), even for a period extending over a week,\r\n     does not hinder the formation of \"rust.\"\r\n\r\n     7. Rustiness may be prevented by placing the sheets in a sufficiently\r\n     warmed smoke-house as long as there is adequate ventilation and a\r\n     moist atmosphere does not persist.\r\n\r\n     The simplest means of prevention is to soak the sheets first for a\r\n     short period in water, and then to hang them to drip for a few hours\r\n     in a well-ventilated place, outside the factory and under cover.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] We advise and practise hanging sheets in the open, without shade or\r\ncover.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered that, although there may be a slight difference between\r\nour previous views and those advanced by Hellendoorn as to the exact cause\r\nof formation of the \"rusty\" film, the general conclusions are identical\r\nwith those given by us in preceding paragraphs and previously advised in\r\nthe Malayan reports of the Rubber Growers' Association.\r\n\r\nBUBBLES.--The presence of bubbles in sheet-rubber has for years been the\r\nbane of some managers' existence, and the bone of contention between\r\nsellers and buyers. Taking the argument down to bed-rock, producers urge\r\nthat the presence of bubbles has no influence upon the ultimate quality of\r\nthe rubber on vulcanisation. They assert that the alleged defect is merely\r\na peg upon which to hang an unreal grievance, serving the purpose of the\r\nbuyer under the existing conditions of sale. All this may be true, but as\r\nlong as the present system continues, it must be recognised that \"kicking\r\nagainst the pricks\" is a futile recreation.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of the writers is certainly on the side of the producers,\r\ninasmuch as they realise how extremely difficult, and even impossible at\r\ntimes, it is for the most careful individual to prepare sheet-rubber free\r\nfrom this blemish.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written, and many have been the discussions, on this vexed\r\nsubject; and it is recognised that sometimes, in spite of all precautions,\r\nthere may suddenly be an incidence of bubbles in rubber which is ordinarily\r\nfree from them. It must be allowed that climatic conditions and\r\nphysiological variations affecting the metabolic functions of the trees\r\nexert an influence which is difficult at times to combat, and often beyond\r\nhuman control.\r\n\r\nThe contributory causes are many and varied. It should be premised that,\r\nalthough the defect is described as \"air-bubbles,\" it is seldom that the\r\nappellation is strictly correct. Rarely do the bubbles contain air. In the\r\nvast majority of cases they contain gases in minute quantity. These gases\r\nmay be considered to arise, broadly, from some decomposition of substances\r\n(other than rubber), contained either in the coagulum or in the serum. In a\r\ngeneral way, if this decomposition is evidenced by an unpleasant odour, it\r\nis described under the term of \"putrefaction.\" We are not concerned here\r\nwith the question as to how far such decomposition may be ascribed to a\r\npurely chemical action, or to the indirect result of the presence of\r\ncertain bacteria or other micro-organisms. Suffice it to state that, at\r\nleast as far as field operations influence the result, the decomposition is\r\ngenerally to be attributed to the work of micro-organisms. Conditions\r\nfavourable to the incidence and development of these are to be found when\r\nabsolute cleanliness in all details is not aimed at.\r\n\r\nWith this preamble we may proceed to classify possible causes of the\r\nformation of bubbles into two groups:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Those originating in field operations.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Others which may arise after the arrival of the latex at the\r\n     factory.\r\n\r\nIN THE FIELD.--Decomposition may be caused by:\r\n\r\n     (1) Spouts, buckets, and cups being dirty. Regular cleaning is\r\n     necessary. If the buckets are allowed to be taken to the lines by\r\n     tappers, trouble may ensue. Within the writers' experience it has been\r\n     shown that an otherwise baffling case of premature flocculation of\r\n     latex was traced to the presence of acid substances in the buckets,\r\n     which had been used by coolies for preparing their food.\r\n\r\n     (2) Delay in commencing work. This means similar delay in collecting\r\n     the latex which is exposed to greater heat than under ordinary\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     (3) Exposure to the sun's rays. The heating of the latex may provide\r\n     improved conditions favourable to the development and action of\r\n     micro-organisms.\r\n\r\n     (4) Allowing latex to stand too long before collection. This usually\r\n     is the result of giving tappers too great a task.\r\n\r\n     (5) The addition of water to the latex, either purposely or\r\n     accidentally, in the form of rain. The water may be slightly acid in\r\n     character, or it may carry micro-organisms from the bark into the\r\n     latex.\r\n\r\n     (6) Tapping trees at too great a height. The latex generally has an\r\n     abnormal distance to travel before reaching the cup.\r\n\r\n     (7) Sometimes the latex from old trees, or from trees after wintering\r\n     (just prior to full renewal of leaf), contains more than the usual\r\n     proportion of substances (_e.g._, sugars), which are capable of\r\n     effecting flocculation or coagulation.\r\n\r\n     (8) Too great a distance for transport. The trouble arising from this\r\n     cause is likely to be much increased if the journey has to be made\r\n     over bad roads. In such case the physical action augments the effect\r\n     likely to be produced by long standing.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing do not include all possible causes, but serve to indicate the\r\ndirections from which trouble may be mainly anticipated. It will be plain\r\nthat any latex which exhibits symptoms of premature coagulation (or minute\r\nflocculation) should be regarded as a potential source of bubbles in\r\nsheet-rubber.\r\n\r\nIt will be equally obvious that the employment in the field of any harmless\r\nsubstance of an anti-coagulant nature is to be encouraged. This point is\r\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nIN THE FACTORY.--As a general rule it may be understood that the mischief\r\nhas been done before the latex is handled at the factory. Sometimes it is\r\nperceptible from the peculiar appearance of the latex, and in such case the\r\nbatch should not be used for the preparation of sheet-rubber. Often it is\r\nfound that only the last to arrive at the store is visibly affected. This\r\nshould not be mixed with other apparently normal latex, as it is capable of\r\nacting as a \"leaven\" to the bulk.\r\n\r\nContributory factors in the store are:\r\n\r\n     (1) Lack of cleanliness of utensils, particularly of coagulating\r\n     dishes or tanks.\r\n\r\n     The trouble becomes acute sometimes where wooden tanks are employed.\r\n     Unless the tank and the partitions are thoroughly and regularly\r\n     cleansed, the wood may become coated with a bacterial slime, which is\r\n     capable of causing what may be termed \"fermentation\" of the latex\r\n     layers in contact.\r\n\r\n     The tank should be thoroughly cleaned occasionally with a weak (5 per\r\n     cent.) solution of sodium bisulphite. The partitions should be\r\n     scrubbed and placed in the sun twice or three times a week.\r\n\r\n     (2) Allowing latex to stand too long before treatment. This point\r\n     needs no further expansion.\r\n\r\n     (3) The use of a latex of too high a rubber content. Such latices are\r\n     difficult to handle in order to secure uniform mixture with the\r\n     coagulant.\r\n\r\n     (4) The use of too concentrated a solution of coagulant. In\r\n     conjunction with (3) there may be a rapid and irregular coagulation,\r\n     giving rise not only to decomposition in parts (and subsequent\r\n     formation of gas), but also to the formation of true \"air-bubbles\" by\r\n     inclusion of air during stirring.\r\n\r\n     (5) The use of insufficient coagulant. Coagulation is slow and\r\n     incomplete.\r\n\r\n     (6) Defective straining and skimming. Small flocculated particles of\r\n     rubber may pass, or be rubbed through, the strainer. If allowed to\r\n     remain, they act as local points of danger.\r\n\r\n     (7) The proximity of the coagulating latex to some source of heat, or\r\n     exposure to sunlight.\r\n\r\n     (8) Any delay of drying in the preliminary stages, either before or\r\n     after the rubber enters the smoke-house.\r\n\r\nBLISTERS.--This description aptly fits the case in which sheet-rubber in\r\nthe smoke-house exhibits large bubbles of gas which distend the surface of\r\nthe rubber. When subjected to pressure, small \"balloons\" are formed, which\r\nburst with a perceptible report. It was formerly the belief that this\r\ndefect was occasioned solely by an abnormally high temperature. That such\r\nis not the case can be shown by the experience of estates which have had\r\nonly the rubber of a particular day or short period affected under normal\r\nfactory conditions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is not disputed that the heat of the smoke-house exerts\r\nan influence (causing expansion and distension), but it is advanced that\r\nthe gases had begun to form before the rubber entered the house.\r\n\r\nThe view held is that decomposition had supervened or was taking\r\nplace--probably from one or more of the causes enumerated in the preceding\r\nparagraphs. The heat of the smoke-house only serves to exaggerate the\r\neffect. It is acknowledged that the degree of decomposition must be\r\ninitially greater than in the ordinary incidence of \"bubbles.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond this point we are not in a position to put forward any definite\r\nsupposition as to the apparently haphazard occurrence of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, fortunately, that the defect is comparatively rare, and\r\nseldom appears on estates which employ an anti-coagulant in the field.\r\nWhile we have examined persistent cases, one of which led to a temporary\r\ndiscontinuance of the preparation of smoked sheet rubber, we have not yet\r\nbeen able to arrive at any satisfactory idea of the exact conditions\r\ngoverning the incidence of \"blisters.\" Our investigations only lead us to\r\ntwo observations:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) That blisters have appeared on the rubber of some estates after\r\n     wintering, and during the period of new leaf-development.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) That the defect has been noted on other estates during a period\r\n     when there were frequent but not heavy rains, and when there was a\r\n     comparatively low average temperature.\r\n\r\nIn either case, as the factors are beyond human control, it would be\r\nexpected that without any change being made in estate procedure, the\r\ntrouble would vanish as mysteriously as it appeared. This is our\r\nexperience; but as showing the possible intensive effect of a high\r\ntemperature in the smoke-house, it may be remarked that very infrequently,\r\nin a batch of sheets exhibiting ordinary bubbles, a few hanging directly\r\nabove the furnaces show signs of a slight blistering effect.\r\n\r\n\"SPOT\" DISEASE IN SHEET RUBBER.--That \"spot\" disease may appear in\r\nair-dried sheets was evident at the beginning of the outbreak in the spring\r\nof 1911. The first cases noticed took the form of pink and bluish \"blushes\"\r\nspreading over the whole of the sheets. Later, fungoid spots began to\r\nappear. These mainly took the form of red or black blotches, and were very\r\nunsightly. As \"spot\" disease cannot develop in smoked rubber, the obvious\r\nand simple course to adopt was to smoke-cure the sheets. When it is stated\r\nthat \"spots\" do not develop in smoke-cured rubber, it is understood that\r\nthe smoke-curing must be efficient and must commence as soon as the rubber\r\nhas been rolled, and the surface water has drained away. If the sheets are\r\nallowed to air-dry for a few days, the disease may develop, and then\r\nsmoke-curing will not get rid of the coloured patches. The operation of\r\nsmoke-curing will not get rid of the coloured patches. The operation of\r\nsmoke-curing may tone down the colour, but the spots would still remain\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT MARKS.--It frequently occurs that one sees across the middle of\r\nsmoked sheets a wide mark. This is where the wooden support in the\r\nsmoking-chamber has been. As a rule, even in the most careful cases a faint\r\nmark may always be seen, but in many instances this mark is exaggerated to\r\nsuch an extent as to point to lack of care on the part of the store\r\nsupervision. If bays of racks remain empty over-night, they may possibly\r\nbecome covered with a light sprinkling of fine wood-ash and tarry deposit.\r\nWet rubber placed upon these racks will pick up and retain the impurities,\r\nand more often than not they cannot be washed out. It is incumbent upon the\r\nmanager to see that empty racks are thoroughly cleansed before placing wet\r\nrubber upon them. The better plan is to arrange that the bars can be\r\nremoved easily from sockets. There should be in stock sufficient \"spares\"\r\nfor, say, two days' rubber. When the dry rubber is removed, the bars should\r\nlikewise be taken away, to be cleansed and kept in the factory until again\r\nrequired. This will ensure that fresh rubber always rests upon a clean\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nOn some estates, in order to guard against a pronounced \"bar-mark,\" sheets\r\nare moved and turned daily.\r\n\r\nIn other smoke-houses the upper surface of the bar is chiselled in concave\r\nform, so as to admit of the passage of smoke below the surface resting on\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nSTICKINESS.--This is not to be confounded with \"tackiness,\" from which the\r\nrubber does not recover. Stickiness is only temporary, and may be remedied.\r\nAs a general rule, it is due to packing sheets, which have not a good\r\nraised \"ribbing,\" and which may have been coated with light tarry deposits\r\n(see Glaze). This surface film may be removed by washing the sheets, or\r\nscrubbing them, with cold water. Usually a further two days' air-drying\r\nwill make the rubber fit for packing; and if the smoke-curing has been\r\nefficient, there should be no need to anticipate trouble from mildew. Some\r\nestates adopt this practice daily with success, as a form of insurance\r\nagainst complaints of surface deposits.\r\n\r\nRIBBING, SURFACE PATTERN.--While we know that the passing of sheets of\r\nrubber between rolls, causing a particular raised pattern to appear, has no\r\neffect upon the actual quality of the rubber, there is a great deal of\r\npractical advantage gained.\r\n\r\nThe practice ensures an increase of superficial area which is an aid in\r\ndrying, improves the appearance of the rubber for selling purposes, and is\r\nof distinct advantage in enabling the rubber when packed to travel in\r\nbetter condition. Sheets do not become so closely packed; sampling and\r\ngeneral handling are easier on delivery.\r\n\r\nAs long as the plane surfaces are sufficiently and regularly distorted,\r\nthere would seem to be no limits to the type of pattern or \"mark\" which may\r\nbe placed upon the rubber. But in actual practice the variety is small. The\r\nmost popular type of \"ribbing\" is that best described as a small diamond\r\neffect, produced by a pair of rolls cut with closely placed narrow grooves\r\nrunning spirally. The spirals travel in the same direction on both rolls,\r\nproducing close-cut ribbing running in opposite directions on the surfaces\r\nof the sheet. On sheets of standard thickness, the result approaches a\r\ndiamond effect.\r\n\r\nA few other patterns are employed, notably that producing longitudinal\r\nstripes of varying thickness. On the whole, the type of pattern would seem\r\nto be immaterial, if the points already indicated are achieved.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom one encounters a case nowadays in which the \"marking\" is\r\nunsuitable, but a few estates may be using an old type of patterned roll on\r\nwhich the full diamond grooving is cut. As this appears on both sides of\r\nthe sheet of rubber, and as the ribbing does not coincide, a blurred effect\r\nis seen when the sheet is viewed against the light.\r\n\r\nTHICK ENDS, \"SHEET CLIPPINGS.\"--It rarely happens, even with good equipment\r\nand average supervision, that the preparation of smoked sheet is\r\nunaccompanied by slight defects. For instance, in spite of rules and\r\nregulations regarding manipulation of the coagulum, it is not uncommon to\r\nfind that some sheets, after rolling, have slightly thickened ends. In the\r\nordinary course of events these might delay drying considerably. It is the\r\npractice on some estates to cut off these thickened ends while the rubber\r\nis still wet. The pieces are then machined into crepe form, but as no\r\nsodium bisulphite may have been used, the resulting rubber cannot be\r\nclassed as No. 1 Standard Crepe.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative is to trim the ends when the bulk of the rubber is\r\nthoroughly smoke-dried. The moisture containing portions are then returned\r\nto the smoke-house until dry, and are subsequently packed without further\r\ntreatment as \"smoked-sheet clippings.\" It will be plain that, except in the\r\nparticularity of form, these clippings differ in no degree from the\r\noriginal sheets; and, owing to extra smoke-curing, may arrive in even\r\nbetter condition. One must be prepared, however, to find that a slightly\r\nlower price is offered. Whether the price obtained would be comparable with\r\nthat commanded by the crepe made from wet sheet slipping would depend upon\r\ngeneral ruling market conditions, and the degree of care exercised in\r\nguarding against the inclusion of any inferior pieces of rubber. In\r\nordinary factory practice, there could be no room for abuse under the\r\nlatter clause.\r\n\r\nOTHER INFREQUENT DEFECTS.--This chapter will be closed with a reference to\r\nother small defects which, although infrequent, cannot be classed as minor\r\ncomplaints. In point of fact, when they occur, they assume an importance,\r\nin the eyes of the consumer, which is not, perhaps, sufficiently\r\nappreciated by producers.\r\n\r\nDIRT.--Trouble from this source should be absent, but carelessness on the\r\npart of packing coolies may be responsible for occasional complaints. How\r\nthe dirt is incident may remain a mystery, but it has been noted that\r\nsheets have at times been thrown upon a cement floor. A certain amount of\r\nloose dust may thus adhere to the rubber.\r\n\r\nASH.--The source of this surface deposit scarcely needs indication. Where\r\nopen-hearth furnaces are employed, and the wire-mesh floor screens are not\r\nperfectly sound, fine ash may find its way into the upper chamber. If this\r\ntrouble is persistent in spite of precautions, the sheets should be\r\nsurface-washed and air-dried before packing.\r\n\r\nBARK.--Complaints of the presence of particles of bark in sheet rubber used\r\nto be fairly frequent, but are now less common. The trouble may be traced\r\nto the use of defective straining sieves when the latex is being handled.\r\n\r\nSPLINTERS.--The use of packing-cases of unplaned soft timber is responsible\r\nfor complaints of this nature on delivery. Without here discussing the\r\nlarger question of the ideal packing case, it is sufficient to emphasise\r\nthat the interior surfaces of wooden chests should be planed. The cases are\r\noften so damaged in transit, that splinters of wood may be found throughout\r\nthe contents. The device adopted on some estates may go far to prevent\r\nthis. The cases are first lined with loose sheets, and finally other sheets\r\nare arranged to overlap at the top of the case. The bulk is thus enclosed\r\nin a wrapping of sheets, and any splinters or other deleterious substances\r\nare confined to the surface of the mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nGENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_CHOICE OF COAGULANT_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost without exception, the agent employed in the coagulation of\r\nplantation (_Hevea_) rubber is acetic acid, or in some cases formic acid.\r\nUnder ordinary trade conditions supplies are always obtainable at\r\nreasonable prices, but during the recent War the question of possible\r\nsubstitutes was brought greatly to the fore. Fortunately the subject of\r\ncoagulation and coagulants had been previously studied to such effect in\r\nlaboratory practice, that there would have been small difficulty in\r\nprescribing agents other than acetic acid in cases of expediency. As far as\r\nour knowledge extends, all the possible substances which have the power of\r\ncoagulating latex have been tested. They include mineral acids, organic\r\nacids, compounds known chemically under the general term of \"salts,\"\r\nalcohols, sugars, etc.\r\n\r\nThe heading of this chapter must be seen to \"beg the question,\" inasmuch as\r\nit leads to the assumption that a coagulant (in the popular sense) is\r\nnecessary to secure coagulation. In point of fact, methods are sometimes\r\nemployed which depend upon no artificial coagulant to produce the desired\r\neffect. To these methods reference will be made later.\r\n\r\nIn this section it is proposed to describe briefly the more important\r\nagents which are used, or might be used, in effecting coagulation. In the\r\nclass of those which are not in common use some could be used as\r\nexpedients, while others are only of scientific interest.\r\n\r\nACETIC ACID.--There is no need to enter into a discussion of the merits of\r\nthis agent. In practice it remains the cheapest and safest coagulant known\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nFORMIC ACID.--This agent is equally as safe to use as acetic acid, and as\r\neasy to handle. Bulk for bulk its coagulative power is higher than that of\r\nacetic acid. Its pre-war shipping price, when taken in conjunction with its\r\ncoagulative power, was slightly below that of acetic acid, but local prices\r\nput the balance in favour of the latter. If prevailing costs put it on\r\nterms of parity with acetic acid, there would appear to be no reason why\r\nformic acid should not have a widely-extended use on plantations.\r\n\r\nCITRIC ACID, TARTARIC ACID.--The acids of the extracted juices of most\r\ntropical fruits consist, to a large degree, of citric or tartaric acids.\r\nThese can be used in place of acetic acid as satisfactory coagulants in\r\ncase of emergency; but the questions of availability of supplies and of\r\ncosts preclude their more general adoption.\r\n\r\nOXALIC ACID.--This is a satisfactory coagulant as far as observed effect is\r\nconcerned. It produces a rubber paler than ordinary coagulants (without the\r\nuse of sodium bisulphite), as it has the nature of an anti-oxidant.\r\n\r\nIt would not be a safe agent in the hands of coolies, as it is classed as a\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nSULPHURIC ACID.--During the War, in a period of shortage of acetic acid and\r\nof high prices, this agent was used with success on some estates.\r\n\r\nIt scarcely need be remarked that it is a dangerous substance to handle,\r\nand that its employment must be accompanied by close European supervision.\r\n\r\nAt prevailing prices during the War it was very much cheaper than acetic\r\nacid, and even at the present reduced cost of the latter the advantage\r\nstill lies with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt must be emphasised, however, that the abuse of this agent to any but the\r\nslightest degree is harmful to the resultant rubber. Hence its use would be\r\nsanctioned _only in the absence of the commoner, and much safer,\r\ncoagulants_.\r\n\r\nIn view of the possible incidence of such an emergency, the following\r\nnotes are given. It is impressed that strict adherence to the rules must be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHANDLING SULPHURIC ACID.--(_a_) Always use glass or glazed earthenware\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Pour slowly and avoid splashing. Drops finding their way to clothing\r\nor other fibrous material will destroy it locally; and if thrown upon any\r\npart of the body may cause painful burns.\r\n\r\n(_c_) When diluting this agent always remember to pour the acid into the\r\nwater (_i.e._, the lesser into the greater), and never _vice versa_. Pour\r\nthe acid carefully and slowly down the side of the vessel, and stir well.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Should strong acid be spilled, do not throw water upon it. A supply\r\nof sand or dry earth should be kept close at hand. Throw this upon the\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nSTORING SULPHURIC ACID.--(_a_) Jars or cases should be handled as seldom,\r\nand as carefully, as possible. If the acid is contained in a case, the top\r\nshould be plainly indicated.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Stocks should be stored in a detached building which should not be\r\ndamp. Jars or cases should not stand on a wooden floor if possible.\r\n\r\n(_c_) See (_d_) above.\r\n\r\nBUYING SULPHURIC ACID.--(_a_) Commercial acid of specific gravity 1.84 is\r\nthe best of its kind. It contains impurities which are non-injurious to\r\nrubber preparation.\r\n\r\n(_b_) It is always advisable, if possible, to buy the acid in small jars\r\ncontaining not more than 100 lbs. each. Smaller jars, with a content not\r\nexceeding 50 lbs., would be preferable.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If the acid is bought in jars, it should be stipulated that the\r\nstoppers be covered with a plaster head, and that the containing crate or\r\ncase should have prominent labels or marks indicating the top of the case.\r\n\r\nFORMULA FOR USE OF SULPHURIC ACID.--It will be understood that as this\r\nformula has been calculated for working with latex, having a consistency of\r\n1-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon, it applies in a strict degree only to\r\nsuch latex. In other cases, where the dilution of the latex is not known,\r\nthe formula will serve as a basis for experiment until the correct quantity\r\nhas been discovered.\r\n\r\n(Sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1.84.)\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--The directions must be followed carefully, and glass measuring\r\n     vessels should be used if procurable.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Measure out 1 pint of strong acid, and pour it carefully and\r\n     slowly _down the inner surface_ of a jar containing 20 gallons of\r\n     water. Do not pour it directly into the water.\r\n\r\n     The heavy acid will sink to the bottom of the jar, and a good mixture\r\n     must be obtained by stirring well.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Of this solution (which is approximately 1 per cent. by weight),\r\n     use 1 gallon to 20 gallons of latex.\r\n\r\nReaders are doubtless now well aware of the corrosive action of strong\r\nsulphuric acid, and we scarcely need point out that even the dilute acid\r\nshould not be kept in contact with the usual iron vessels found in\r\nfactories. The mixing of solutions should be done in one of the glazed\r\nearthenware jars commonly in use.\r\n\r\nThe formula given above works out at approximately 1 part strong acid to\r\n2,000 parts of latex (of dry rubber content 1-1/2 lbs. per gallon). The\r\nformula for using acetic acid with the same latex works out at about 1:\r\n1,200. It will be apparent, therefore, that relatively sulphuric acid is a\r\nmore powerful coagulant than acetic acid. In terms of dry rubber obtained\r\nfrom latex of the consistency indicated above--\r\n\r\n     1 lb. sulphuric acid will produce 300 lbs. dry rubber. 1 lb. acetic\r\n     acid will produce 180 lbs. dry rubber.\r\n\r\nWith both acids selling at the same rate, sulphuric acid would be more\r\neconomical in use; when its cost is less than that of acetic acid, which is\r\nthe normal condition, the economic advantage in favour of sulphuric acid is\r\naugmented still further.\r\n\r\nIt may be found that the standard formula for sulphuric acid will not\r\nalways give a perfectly clear remaining serum, even though an attempt is\r\nmade daily to work to a uniform consistency for all latices. It is\r\ninevitable that the manipulation of the latices should be slightly in error\r\non occasions, or that a small mistake might occur in preparing the solution\r\nof acid. Hence a clear remaining serum after coagulation may be secured\r\nless often than a slightly turbid serum. This is as it should be. The\r\nminimum quantity of acid may be adjusted so closely as to give such\r\nresults. If a clear serum is obtained always, that should be an indication\r\nof continual excess of coagulant. Naturally, if a milky serum is always\r\nobtained, the reverse is the case.\r\n\r\nAs a last word on the subject, it may again be emphasised that the use of\r\nsulphuric acid is not advised, except in an emergency; and that the\r\ngreatest possible care must be exercised in the observance of the strict\r\nformula for use.\r\n\r\nHYDROCHLORIC ACID, NITRIC ACID.--These mineral acids would prove more\r\nexpensive than sulphuric acid. In addition they are much more uncertain in\r\naction. For example, the use of a certain excess of hydrochloric acid would\r\nnot hasten coagulation, but would prevent it. Above all their effect, in\r\nexcess, is deleterious to the rubber.\r\n\r\nHYDROFLUORIC ACID.--This has a strong corrosive action on porcelain or\r\nglass. Hence it has to be contained in bottles of gutta-percha or lead. It\r\nis mentioned here merely because some years ago it found a use as a\r\ncoagulant, chiefly in Ceylon. It was sold in the form of a 10 per cent.\r\nsolution under the name of \"Purub,\" and was the subject of a patent.\r\n\r\nIt is effective as a coagulant, and has also an anti-oxidant action, which\r\nwas its chief recommendation when cheap and harmless anti-oxidants were not\r\ncommonly known. It is comparatively expensive, and, as indicated above,\r\ndifficult to handle and store. In short, it has nothing to commend it, in\r\ncomparison with acetic or formic acids.\r\n\r\nALUM.--This substance has been used for years by native rubber producers as\r\na coagulant. It fulfils the desired purpose, and its popularity was\r\nmaintained because of the ease with which it could be stored and handled.\r\nUnfortunately, this facility often led to the use of an excess, and native\r\nsheets were often criticised as being brittle. Investigations have shown\r\nthat alum, even in minimum proportions, has an appreciably harmful effect\r\nupon the quality of the rubber prepared by its use as a coagulating agent.\r\nIts employment by native rubber producers has now been largely superseded\r\nby acetic acid in some form.\r\n\r\nPYROLIGNEOUS ACID.--This is otherwise known under the names of \"crude\r\nacetic acid\" and \"crude wood vinegar.\" Owing to the shortage of acetic acid\r\nduring the War, attention was directed towards the possibility of making an\r\neffective coagulant locally by what is termed the \"dry distillation of\r\nwood\"--_i.e._, the wood is not burned but heated in a retort. The enquiries\r\ncould be placed in two classes:\r\n\r\n     1. Those which aimed at making the pure, strong acid of commerce.\r\n\r\n     2. Those which sought information concerning a crude coagulant\r\n     (pyroligneous acid) on estates.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first class, we can do no better than reproduce our remarks\r\npublished in the April local report of the Rubber Growers' Association for\r\n1916--with the reservation that, on account of a threatened shortage of\r\ntimber, a local scheme might not now be feasible:\r\n\r\n     \"Probably the most common enquiry encountered since the rise in the\r\n     price of acetic acid is concerned with the possibility of making\r\n     acetic acid in this country. It may be stated that the proposition is\r\n     a feasible one, even on a fairly large scale. We have the essentials\r\n     necessary for such a scheme in:\r\n\r\n          \"1. A good supply of suitable timbers, the most valuable of\r\n          which, possibly, is mangrove timber, locally known as 'bakau.'\r\n          Other suitable timbers are known, but as far as preliminary\r\n          experiments show mangrove timber gives the best yield. At present\r\n          this timber is in great demand as a fuel for steam plants, but\r\n          with the extension of the local coal industry the timber may\r\n          become cheaper.\r\n\r\n          \"2. There would appear to be less valuable timber which would be\r\n          suitable for heating the retorts. Or, local coal might be used.\r\n\r\n          \"3. Supplies of lime at reasonable rates are available, as the\r\n          limestone formation in the peninsula is quite considerable in\r\n          extent.\r\n\r\n          \"4. Supplies of sulphuric acid are available from Japan,\r\n          Australia, Burma, etc., even at the present time, although\r\n          naturally rates are higher than normal. Under ordinary\r\n          conditions, supplies from England and parts of Europe would be\r\n          much cheaper than at current rates.\r\n\r\n          \"For the benefit of many readers perhaps a brief and nontechnical\r\n          description of the preparation of acetic acid would not be amiss,\r\n          and would explain the necessity for the essentials indicated\r\n          above. In brief, the process is as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"(_a_) A suitable timber is heated in a closed retort. This is\r\n          termed 'dry distillation,' and results eventually in the\r\n          carbonisation of the wood--_i.e._, charcoal is obtained in the\r\n          retort.\r\n\r\n          \"(_b_) Tar, vapours and gases are distilled over during the\r\n          carbonisation of the wood. These liquors and gases pass through\r\n          condensers. The gases pass away, while the condensed liquors\r\n          separate out into (1) wood tar, (2) a watery liquor called\r\n          pyroligneous acid or crude wood vinegar.\r\n\r\n          \"(_c_) The pyroligneous acid is separated from the tar, and again\r\n          distilled to obtain the acetic acid present.\r\n\r\n          \"(_d_) This crude acid is steam-heated with milk of lime, which\r\n          fixes the acid, forming calcium acetate (or acetate of lime).\r\n\r\n          \"(_e_) Eventually the calcium acetate is taken out in the form of\r\n          a thick paste, which is spread to dry. When dry this 'grey\r\n          acetate' is the main source of all glacial acetic acid now made.\r\n\r\n          \"(_f_) The acetic acid is released from the 'acetate of lime' by\r\n          the action of sulphuric acid. It is then distilled several times,\r\n          and under various conditions, in order to increase its strength.\r\n          In the past copper tubes were used for this purpose, but owing to\r\n          the fact that traces of copper were found to be injurious to\r\n          rubber, some works instal tubes of glazed earthenware for the\r\n          distillation.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the process in outline, and it will be seen that no proposal\r\n     to manufacture _glacial acetic acid_ on an estate could be considered\r\n     feasible, although it would not present any great difficulty on a\r\n     large scale and under skilled direction. Furthermore, the cost of the\r\n     plant would be far too great for any estate.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it is clear that pure acetic acid is beyond the scope of an\r\nestate, crude pyroligneous acid has been produced on a varying scale in\r\nthis country and in Ceylon. In the latter country some success was obtained\r\nby the distillation of coconut shells with comparatively inexpensive plant.\r\nIn this country, wood-distillation was practised on a few estates, but\r\nimproved facilities for obtaining pure acetic led to a termination of the\r\nexperiments, although sufficient crude acid could then be made at a\r\nreasonable cost.\r\n\r\nThe pyroligneous acid obtained, is generally clear, after nitration, and of\r\na dark brown colour. It has a peculiar odour reminiscent of smoked\r\nsheet-rubber, or of creosotic substances in general.\r\n\r\nIts acid content depends chiefly upon:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The kind of timber heated in the retort.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The efficiency of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Condition of the timber as to moisture.\r\n\r\n     (_d_) The temperature employed, and rate of working.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) The point at which distillation ceases (_i.e._, the duration of\r\n     interval between commencement of heating and cessation of collection).\r\n\r\nSamples received from estates for testing purposes were found to contain\r\nequivalents varying from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent. of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThey were all suitable coagulants when used in quantity calculated from the\r\ndiscovered acidity, but produced rubber darker than ordinary when\r\nair-dried. This effect was not of much importance in the preparation of\r\nsmoked sheets, but to produce a pale crepe it was necessary to employ\r\nsodium bisulphite as an anti-oxidant.\r\n\r\nThis darkening in colour is to be ascribed to the presence of traces of\r\nphenols,[24] which are stated to exert an effect upon the rubber during and\r\nafter vulcanisation.[25] This subject will be discussed in another section.\r\n\r\n[24] Whitby, _Journal Soc. Chem. Industry_, vol. xxxv., No. 9, 1916.\r\n\r\n[25] See also \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Rubber\" (Eaton,\r\nGrantham, and Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture,\r\nApril, 1918.\r\n\r\nWith this provision the crude pyroligneous acid which can be produced on\r\nestates, could be employed as a coagulant until such time as the price of\r\nglacial acetic acid was so low as to make the production of the crude acid\r\nnon-profitable. This point would be determined from a knowledge of the cost\r\nof production per gallon, and the percentage of acetic acid per unit. For\r\nexample, if the cost of production (including cost of timber for\r\ndistillation, cost of fuel for heating the retort, cost of labour, etc.)\r\nwas 60 cents per gallon of crude acid containing 9 per cent. of acetic\r\nacid, that would be equivalent approximately to buying glacial acetic acid\r\nat $30 per demijohn of 44 lbs.\r\n\r\nSMOKED WATER.--A weak solution of pyroligneous acid may also be obtained\r\nby passing smoke through water. With this object in view, a machine was\r\ndesigned by the Federated Engineering Company of Kuala Lumpur. In this the\r\nprinciple of retorting was not employed. Smoke was produced by ordinary\r\ncombustion in a compartment of the apparatus, and was drawn through water\r\nby the action of a high-speed fan worked by hand. A solution, equivalent in\r\neffect to a 2 per cent. solution of acetic acid, could be obtained at a\r\ncomparatively cheaper cost than crude pyroligneous acid produced by dry\r\ndistillation as it was then being practised. This was chiefly because of\r\nthe wasteful methods of fuel combustion, in the latter process, in the\r\nheating of the retort.\r\n\r\nCHINESE VINEGAR.--This agent was found to be a satisfactory coagulant, and,\r\n_a priori_, there is no reason why it should not be suitable, as it is\r\nessentially a dilute solution of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe qualities sold were generally colourless, and were probably the result\r\nof acetic fermentation of rice.\r\n\r\nSamples tested showed a varying content of acetic acid, ranging roughly\r\nfrom 3 per cent. to 8 per cent.; but on this basis of valuation it was\r\nfound generally that the price bore no relation to the degree of\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nIt was advanced not only that the vinegar was an efficient substitute for\r\nglacial acetic acid, but that it was also cheaper. This latter claim was\r\nproved to have no foundation in fact, even at the high price of acetic acid\r\nprevailing during the period of stress. It is not likely, therefore, that\r\nvinegar can displace acetic acid, except as an expedient.\r\n\r\nSULPHUROUS ACID.--The anti-oxidant effect of sodium bisulphite and sodium\r\nsulphite is due to the liberation of the gas, sulphur dioxide. This gas\r\ndissolves easily in water, forming an acid solution called sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\nThis acid solution is an effective coagulant in fairly small quantity. Not\r\nonly so, but it produces, in addition, the anti-oxidant effect noted in the\r\nemployment of sodium bisulphite. It is thus possible to produce rubber\r\nvarying in shade of paleness by means of a single solution.\r\n\r\nIn the event of sulphurous acid being used, it would be necessary to\r\nimport cylinders of sulphur dioxide from which the solution could be\r\nprepared in factories each day. There would be no insurmountable difficulty\r\nin this, as it is only necessary to pass the gas through a series of closed\r\nvessels containing water. Enough solution could be prepared at one time for\r\nthree or four days, but preferably the solutions should be as fresh as\r\npossible. Altogether there would seem to be possibilities in the use of\r\nsulphurous acid for preparing pale crepe rubbers, providing the cost is\r\nwithin comparable limits with the commoner coagulants at present in use,\r\nand that no adverse effect on the rubber can be shown to result. If the\r\ncost did not exceed the combined cost of acetic acid and sodium bisulphite,\r\nthe employment of sulphurous acid solution might be worthy of\r\nconsideration. There is one drawback to the use of sulphurous acid\r\nsolution, and that lies in the proximity of the limits of the quantities\r\nnecessary for coagulation and that which is in excess, and prevents\r\ncoagulation. Thus, with ordinary field latex having about 20 per cent. dry\r\nrubber content, the minimum necessary for coagulation per 100 c.c. of latex\r\nis about 8 c.c. of a 1 per cent. solution. The maximum quantity possible\r\nfor use is about 15 c.c. of a 1 per cent, solution, so that great care\r\nwould have to be exercised in avoiding an excess of coagulant, otherwise\r\ncoagulation would be effectually prevented.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the preparation of rubber by this method is the subject\r\nof a patent secured by Messrs. Boake, Roberts, and Co., London.\r\n\r\nSUGARS.--Coagulation may be effected by the addition of small quantities of\r\nsugars.[26] These are assumed to be effective by fermentative conversion\r\ninto lactic and acetic acids. The presence of lactic acid is supposed to\r\nhave a twofold effect:\r\n\r\n[26] \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Para Rubber\" (Eaton,\r\nGrantham, and Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture;\r\nGorter and Swart, Bulletin No. 6, West Java Expt. Station.\r\n\r\n     (_a_) As a direct coagulant.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) In its action upon certain organisms which, in the ordinary\r\n     course of events, would delay or prevent coagulation. Although work on\r\n     an experimental scale has been done, as far as we know no practical\r\n     application has been made of the employment of sugars as coagulating\r\n     agents.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS SALTS.--Of experimental interest only it may be recorded that\r\ncoagulation has been effected by means of various chemical \"salts\"--_e.g._,\r\ncalcium chloride, barium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride,\r\naluminium sulphate, magnesium sulphate, sodium sulphate, etc. None of these\r\nhas been found to have any practical application, except, perhaps, calcium\r\nchloride, which is used in small quantity as an accelerating agent in a\r\nspecial process of anaerobic coagulation, which will receive mention in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\nAt one period during the War and the dearth of acetic acid, it was found\r\nthat there were available in England large supplies of the acid sulphate of\r\nsodium (sodium hydrogen sulphate), which proved to be an effective\r\ncoagulant. Experimental work gave satisfactory results, but no practical\r\napplication resulted when supplies of acetic acid were again obtainable.\r\n\r\nVARIOUS PROPRIETARY COMPOUNDS.--We have seen many proprietary coagulants\r\nadvertised and pass into the limbo of forgotten things. They can generally\r\nbe divided into two classes. The first embraces those founded upon a\r\nwoefully incomplete knowledge of requirements. The second covers those\r\nwhich meet requirements, but for which exaggerated claims are made and\r\nexcessive prices charged.\r\n\r\nAs as instance of a substance which fell under both classifications might\r\nbe mentioned the case of \"Coagulatex.\" Pretentious claims were made, and it\r\nwas emphasised that the liquid contained no _vegetable acids_. Acetic and\r\nformic acids might be quoted as examples of vegetable acids, and as these\r\nhave been shown to be the most satisfactory coagulants now employed one\r\nfails to imagine where lay the value of the guarantee given by the\r\nadvertisers of \"Coagulatex.\"\r\n\r\nOn analysis the liquid was found to consist mainly of sulphuric acid,\r\nagainst the indiscriminate use of which warnings have been given. Thus it\r\nwas a dangerous substance for common use.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, comparing the value with its sulphuric acid content, it was\r\nfound that the price required for \"Coagulatex\" was roughly four times the\r\ncontemporary cost of commercial sulphuric acid in the Federated Malay\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThose in charge of estates should realise, therefore, that no proprietary\r\ncoagulants should be adopted until a proper report of tests, and a\r\ncomparative valuation, has been obtained from one of the research\r\nlaboratories.\r\n\r\nCARBONIC ACID GAS, CARBON DIOXIDE.--Now of only scientific interest, it may\r\nbe noted that some years ago great claims were made for the use of carbon\r\ndioxide gas as a coagulant. In actual practice we were unable to effect\r\ncoagulation by passing the dry gas into latex. It was suggested that the\r\noriginal investigators were misled by failure to secure a dry and clean\r\ngas. It would appear that probably the gas was prepared by the action of\r\nhydrochloric acid upon marble or limestone. Unless intervening \"washers\"\r\nand \"driers\" were used, the liberated gas, when passed into latex, would\r\ncarry with it traces of hydrochloric acid, which would effect coagulation.\r\n\r\nALCOHOL.--In the cheap form of methylated spirit, alcohol has been employed\r\nby us as a speedy coagulant for many years. Latex run slowly into alcohol\r\ncoagulates instantaneously. The method has been in common laboratory use.\r\n\r\nThe employment of alcohol has also been made the part-subject of a patent\r\nprocess of coagulation, to which reference will be made in the succeeding\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE EXTRACTS.--At various times experimental work has been directed\r\ntowards the use of liquids of purely vegetable origin, such as the juices\r\nof tropical fruits, and of a waste product of tropical industry--the\r\nso-called \"milk\" (or water) of ripe coconuts.\r\n\r\nIn the former class there is usually a natural acidity, but in coconut\r\nwater the acidity is chiefly the result of fermentation of the carbohydrate\r\n(sugar) constituents.\r\n\r\nThese substances were all found to effect a more or less satisfactory\r\ncoagulation, but it is unlikely that they would be suitable for practical\r\napplication on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAs being more directly related to the subject of coagulation in general\r\nthan to coagulants in particular, a discussion of several special processes\r\nwill be relegated to the ensuing chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_SPECIAL METHODS OF PREPARATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery year appears to bring forth some new ideas in the mode of rubber\r\npreparation. Some of them are based in principle upon the oldest known\r\nmethod--_i.e._, the native Brazilian process of making \"Hard Para.\" Others\r\nstrike a new note, and in a few cases the claims put forward are\r\nsubstantially confirmed by results. In other instances the claims are too\r\npretentious, and discredit may be brought upon schemes which, although\r\nlacking in comparative success, are yet commendable for the ingenuity\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nTo the present not one of these new methods has been able to compete to any\r\nmarked degree in general practice with the established methods of ordinary\r\npreparation. A few continue to find local application, but most have either\r\nbeen abandoned or are gradually falling into desuetude.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to discuss in fine detail all the various claims made on\r\nbehalf of these special processes, or to enter into controversies. The aim\r\nis to present to the reader an outline embodying the main principles and\r\nadvantages claimed.\r\n\r\nDA COSTA PROCESS.--Briefly, this was a method by which coagulation was\r\neffected with smoke. The smoke was generated by the combustion of wood in a\r\nspecial compartment, and was forced into latex by means of a jet of steam.\r\nIt was really only applied to the preparation of coagulum intended for\r\ncrepe form. The exact degree of coagulation effected was uncertain, and the\r\nfinal colour of the rubber precluded it from being classed as a modern No.\r\n1 product.\r\n\r\n\"BYRNE CURING\" PROCESS.--This is a process for treating coagulum obtained\r\nby ordinary methods.\r\n\r\nIt was the subject of a patent obtained by Messrs. E. J. and F. A. Byrne,\r\nand at one time had a considerable vogue on estates. The chief claim\r\nadvanced was that the rubber produced was in all respects equal to Fine\r\nHard Para, and could be shipped while still moist without detriment to the\r\nphysical qualities.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the process was the treatment of coagulum, in either sheet\r\nor thick crepe form, with vapours produced by the volatilisation of two\r\nspecial fluids. This treatment was undertaken in comparatively small wooden\r\nsheds, in which the coagulum was placed. The \"smoke\" was conducted into the\r\ncuring sheds from furnaces outside the building. The sheds were covered\r\nexternally with \"felt\" material to prevent leakage of the vapours, and a\r\nvery dense smoke was obtained.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces were specially designed, and consisted essentially of a\r\n\"hot-plate\" heated by a powerful kerosene blast-flame. On top of the\r\nmachine were two reservoirs controlled by taps. In these were placed the\r\nspecial fluids which were released in definite proportion. The composition\r\nof the fluids was not divulged, but it is assumed that the principal\r\ningredients were (_a_) wood tar products, (_b_) crude pyroligneous or\r\nacetic acid. The mixture of these, dropping on the hot plate at the correct\r\ntemperature, spontaneously volatilised, to form dense whitish fumes, having\r\nan intense and not disagreeable odour of wood combustion. A duct led from\r\nthe back of the machine into the curing-shed, where the vapours were\r\ndistributed through perforations in the pipe.\r\n\r\nThe coagulum usually remained under treatment in the shed for three to four\r\nhours, and then was removed for ordinary air-drying. When taken from the\r\ncuring-shed it had a pinkish colour, which later developed into a dark\r\nbrown by a natural process of oxidation. The exterior of the rubber, on\r\nshipment, resembled the appearance of smoked sheets; while the interior, on\r\ncutting, was seen to be still white. As packed for shipping, the rubber\r\ncontained from 10 to 15 per cent. of original moisture, for the usual sheet\r\nform, and even more when \"slab\" rubber was prepared.\r\n\r\nOriginally either crepe or sheet rubber was made, but later the preparation\r\nof the crepe form was displaced largely by \"slab\" rubber. These \"slabs\"\r\nwere really very thick sheets, which had been subject to only slight\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nStill later the preparation of the \"slab\" form was displaced by \"loaf\"\r\nrubber. This form was built up by winding together ordinary thin sheets\r\nwhich had been subject to the \"cure.\" Only slight tension was needed,\r\nduring the operation of winding, to cause close adhesion of the component\r\nwet layers, and the final result was a \"loaf\" or roll dark in colour, and\r\napparently dry when examined superficially. On being cut, even after an\r\ninterval of months, the middle portion was still so moist as to be quite\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIn course of time it was discovered that all the claims made for the\r\nprocess could not be substantiated, and for various reasons (which need not\r\nbe detailed) most of the estates which had adopted the scheme reverted to\r\nordinary methods of preparation. At the time of writing few, if any,\r\ncontinue to work the process. It appears to be agreed, as the result of\r\ninvestigations, that in no degree does the process yield advantage over\r\nordinary methods.\r\n\r\nFREEZING PROCESS.--A patent was secured a few years ago to cover a process\r\nwhereby coagulation was effected by refrigeration.\r\n\r\nLatex remained for several hours in the refrigerating chambers of an\r\nordinary ice-making plant. The resulting solid mass, on being thawed,\r\nyielded a coagulum appearing in no way to differ from that obtained by\r\nordinary methods of coagulation.\r\n\r\nProvided the process exerted no influence for good or evil upon the quality\r\nof the resulting dry rubber, the value of it would appear to depend upon\r\nthe relative cost of working, plus considerations of capital expenditure\r\nand depreciation on the plant. At the present time it would be difficult to\r\nimagine that the cost of preparation alone would compare favourably with\r\nthat sustained by ordinary coagulative methods.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, beyond the expensive refrigerating plant, the usual machinery\r\nof a factory would still be required if the ordinary market demands are to\r\nbe met.\r\n\r\nFinally, it has not been found[27] that any advantage in the final physical\r\nqualities of the rubber is obtained by the employment of this process.\r\n\r\n[27] \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Rubber\" (Eaton, Grantham,\r\nand Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nWICKHAM PROCESS.--This process, invented by Sir Henry Wickham, aimed at the\r\nproduction of a rubber resembling Fine Hard Para. The principle employed\r\nwas that underlying the preparation of the best rubber in Brazil--viz.,\r\ncoagulation of superimposed thin layers of latex by the action of smoke and\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn essential the machine employed consisted of a rotating drum into which\r\nlatex and smoke entered. The result was the formation of thin \"skins\" of\r\nrubber which, coagulating _in situ_, formed a mass corresponding to \"Fine\r\nHard.\"\r\n\r\nThat the rubber was fully satisfactory as to quality is acknowledged, but\r\neconomically and in practical utility the process was unsuccessful, the\r\nrate of output being so low.\r\n\r\nDERRY PROCESS.--The invention of Mr. R. Derry, late of the Singapore\r\nBotanic Gardens, this in principle resembled the Wickham and other\r\nprocesses. It aimed at a mechanical imitation of the native method of\r\nproducing Fine Hard Para.\r\n\r\nIn place of the rotating drum, an endless belt was used. This travelled\r\nover pulleys, more or less horizontally placed. The upper of these could be\r\nraised to varying height above the level of the other, and likewise could\r\nbe so adjusted as to tighten the belt.\r\n\r\nThe under layer of the belt impinged, in its travel, upon the surface of a\r\nlayer of latex contained in a shallow tray. The belt was operated by\r\nhand-power, and the height of the latex trays was adjustable.\r\n\r\nThe trays of latex were situated at the lower end of the machine which lay\r\noutside the smoking-chamber. It will be understood that the vastly major\r\npart of the total length of belt was always within the chamber.\r\n\r\nSmoke was generated by combustion of wood in an external structure, was\r\nbrought into the chamber by a wide duct, and was then distributed below\r\nthe belt by means of perforated pipes.\r\n\r\nThe thin film of latex picked up by the belt was coagulated partly by the\r\naction of smoke constituents by evaporation due to heat. Assuming (1) that\r\nthe belt was of adequate length, (2) that the rate of travel was not\r\nexcessive, (3) that the latex was not too dilute, (4) that the temperature\r\nof the smoke was sufficiently high, (5) that the smoke was sufficiently\r\ndense and not too damp--then the process should be a continuous one.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that success could only be obtained by a careful\r\nadjustment of all these factors. The latex must, necessarily, be of a\r\nfairly rich consistency (at least 2-1/2 lbs. dry rubber per gallon), but\r\nunfortunately there is considerable difficulty in maintaining such latex in\r\na state of fluidity for the period demanded by this process, without loss\r\nof latex. Naturally, the addition of an anti-coagulant would retard the\r\nrate of output of the machine to a marked degree.\r\n\r\nThe layer of rubber thus formed on the belt was stripped off, and hung for\r\nfurther air-drying, as it still contained a fair percentage of moisture.\r\n\r\nAs a really practicable method for treating plantation latex, the process\r\nfailed by reason of its low rate of output over a given interval. This\r\nalone was sufficient to condemn it, apart from the facts (1) that it was\r\nnot shown to be a cheaper method than coagulation by acetic acid, (2) that\r\nthe resulting rubber was not proved to be of superior intrinsic value to\r\nrubber prepared by ordinary methods.\r\n\r\nSPONTANEOUS COAGULATION.--All readers will be aware of the phenomenon of\r\nthe curdling or souring of milk. The behaviour of _Hevea_ latex, under\r\ncertain conditions, may be taken to be analogous. Difficulty is experienced\r\nin maintaining fluidity--a difficulty which appears to vary in great degree\r\naccording to locality, nature of soil, age of trees, the relative demand\r\nmade upon the trees by the system of tapping employed, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes found, before the latex reaches the store, that it may\r\nexhibit one of various stages of premature (spontaneous) coagulation:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) To all appearances it may be quite fluid, but a close\r\n     examination shows it to consist mainly of a serum containing very\r\n     minute particles of rubber in suspension (microscopic coagulation).\r\n\r\n     (_b_) In a later stage these particles coalesce to form larger\r\n     \"flocks\" (macroscopic coagulation).\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The whole, or practically the whole, of the latex may have\r\n     coagulated, forming one mass of rubber with a milky residual serum.\r\n\r\nPassing from this aspect of the question, it may be noted as peculiar facts\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n     (1) A shallow layer of latex is less likely to coagulate spontaneously\r\n     (_i.e._, without the addition of a coagulant) than a deeper volume.\r\n\r\n     (2) The shallow layer, and also the surface of the deeper volume\r\n     (where exposed to air), on standing will be found to develop a\r\n     superficial film of finely coagulated particles, yellowish in colour,\r\n     and having an offensive odour due to decomposition of protein matter.\r\n\r\n     (3) While this partial coagulation is confined only to the surface of\r\n     a shallow layer of latex, it will be found that below the surface film\r\n     of the deeper volume a much more definite coagulation has taken place.\r\n     The coagulation will be practically complete, and the coagulum, apart\r\n     from a spongy appearance, is normal in character. This coagulum is\r\n     free from the offensive odour noted above.\r\n\r\n     (4) On testing the surface film of both the shallow layer and the\r\n     deeper volume, it will be found to be _alkaline_ in character; whilst\r\n     the lower liquid surrounding the main portion of the coagulum in the\r\n     deeper volume of latex is of an _acid_ nature.\r\n\r\nThese observed facts are sufficient to indicate that there are apparently\r\n_two distinct types of spontaneous coagulation_, and that the latter takes\r\nplace particularly where the latex is more or less out of contact with the\r\natmosphere. We may, therefore, differentiate thus:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) _In contact with air (aerobic)_: incomplete spontaneous\r\n     coagulation, accompanied by yellowish slime, offensive in odour and\r\n     alkaline in character.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) _Out of contact with air (Anaerobic)_: Practically or wholly\r\n     complete. There is no offensive odour under normal conditions and the\r\n     serum is acid in character.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded[28] that there are present in latex, on collection in the\r\nfield, two types of organisms. Those which work in contact with air\r\n(aerobic) show a tendency to _prevent_ coagulation and to form an alkaline\r\nyellow slime on the surface of the latex. The others, which work in the\r\nabsence of air (anaerobic), may, under favourable conditions, cause\r\ncomplete coagulation unaccompanied by any decomposition or offensive odour\r\nwithin a normal period. If air is rigidly excluded, the coagulum obtained\r\nis quite satisfactory for all purposes.\r\n\r\n[28] \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Rubber\" (Eaton, Grantham,\r\nand Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture, 1918; \"De la\r\nCoagulation naturelle du Latex d'Hevea Brasiliensis\" (Denier and Vernet),\r\n_Comptes Rendus l'Academie des Sciences_, No. 3, July, 1917.\r\n\r\nThis type of coagulation, without the employment of a chemical coagulant,\r\nand under anaerobic conditions, was the subject of a patent granted in 1914\r\nto Messrs. Maude, Crosse and others. The process has been in use on Cicely\r\nEstate (Perak) for some years. With subsequent slight modifications the\r\napparatus consisted in essential of a tank with a loose cover. The flanges\r\nof the cover were sufficiently long to dip into a water-seal surrounding\r\nthe tank. Thus the cover may rise and fall without an inrush of air.\r\n\r\nCoagulation, in fact, can be effected thus in any kind of air-tight\r\nreceptacle; and experimentally the reader can obtain a satisfactory result\r\nby filling completely with latex the bottle which has a loose stopper.\r\n\r\nUnder the patent held the coagulum may be prepared either for crepe-making,\r\nor for sheets by a modification of the tank.\r\n\r\nThe crepe when dry does not have the bright appearance of the ordinary\r\n\"Fine Pale\" standard prepared with the aid of the anti-oxidant sodium\r\nbisulphite.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the addition of this substance to the latex in normal\r\nproportions is not possible under anaerobic conditions, as it is found to\r\nprevent coagulation, probably owing to its sterilising effect upon the\r\nanaerobic organisms.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the oxidation of the rubber in actual practice, the freshly\r\nprepared crepe is soaked in a solution of sodium bisulphite before hanging\r\nto dry. The resulting colour of the rubber is quite good.\r\n\r\nIt was shown by Eaton and Grantham that anaerobic coagulation is slightly\r\nuncertain in action. Owing probably to variations in the composition of the\r\nlatices, or to the extent of infection by organisms, coagulation may one\r\nday be complete and on other days less satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThey found further that, by the addition of small quantities of sugars,\r\ncoagulation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was improved. The\r\nconclusion formed was that the addition of sugars created a medium\r\nfavourable to the development of anaerobic organisms and unfavourable to\r\nthose which cause decomposition of the natural nitrogenous constituents of\r\nlatex.\r\n\r\nThis work was confirmed by Gorter and Swart,[29] who attributed the action\r\nto the conversion of sugar to lactic, acetic, and succinic acids by\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n[29] Gorter and Swart, Bulletin No. 6, West Java Station.\r\n\r\nDenier and Vernet, whose work has already been mentioned, studied the\r\npresence of the organisms in latex, and succeeded in isolating one which,\r\nunder anaerobic conditions, effects coagulation within twenty-four hours.\r\nSometimes to produce complete coagulation it was found necessary to employ\r\nsmall quantities of sugars--_e.g._, 1 gramme per litre of latex (1:1,000).\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted also that the addition of small quantities of soluble\r\ncalcium (lime) salts to latex has much the same effect as the employment of\r\nsugars. Recent investigations[30] showed that the addition of 0.5 to 1\r\ngramme of calcium chloride per litre of latex caused complete coagulation\r\nin closed vessels within twenty-four hours, a result agreeing with the\r\nfindings of Barrowcliff.\r\n\r\n[30] \"Archief voor de Rubbercultuur,\" Nederlands Indies, 1920, 4, 273.\r\n\r\nOn page 308 of the same publication, experiments on the effect of sugars\r\nare described, in connection with _aerobic_ coagulation. Observations from\r\na further set of experiments tended to indicate a direct connection between\r\nthe effects of tapping and spontaneous coagulation. It is suggested that\r\nheavy tapping causes a diminution in the latex of those substances which\r\nact in some way as accelerating agents in coagulation--_e.g._, sugars. The\r\nsmaller the proportion of these substances, the slower and less complete is\r\nnatural (spontaneous) coagulation.\r\n\r\nILCKEN-DOWN PROCESS.--This process is the subject of patents granted in\r\n1915 to Messrs. Ilcken and Down. It has been in fair prominence, and has\r\nbeen tried experimentally on several estates and in public demonstration.\r\n\r\nIt is a coagulating process, and, in the original specification, employed\r\nas agents a mixture of alcohol (in the form of methylated spirit) and\r\nbenzene (petrol), or alcohol with petrol and coal-tar naphtha. The mixture\r\nwas injected in the form of a fine spray into the latex, contained in a\r\ntank specially fitted with paddles.\r\n\r\nLater modifications covered the addition of a small quantity of glycerine;\r\nor, failing supplies of that substance, coconut oil.\r\n\r\nMany advantages are claimed for the process, but most of them cannot be\r\nsubstantiated. The two chief claims are:\r\n\r\n     1. The production of a uniform standard of rubber.\r\n\r\n     2. The obtainment from a unit volume of latex of a greater weight of\r\n     rubber than can be obtained from an equal volume of the same latex by\r\n     ordinary coagulation with acetic acid. It is to be inferred that the\r\n     agents employed have the power of adding to the coagulum some of the\r\n     substances which usually remain in solution in the clear serum.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first of these claims, it has been shown[31] that the rubber\r\nis not uniform in its behaviour on vulcanisation, and that its variability\r\nis similar to that of rubber prepared by other processes.\r\n\r\n[31] \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Rubber\" (Eaton, Grantham,\r\nand Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe second claim has been the subject of much controversy. Experiments made\r\non estates under the supervision of, or in the absence of, the patentees\r\nhave given conflicting results. When varying factors have been eliminated,\r\nthe general conclusion was that no increase in weight of rubber was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nPrivate laboratory investigations led to a similar verdict, and Eaton[32]\r\nrecords a confirmatory finding. More recently the claims made for the\r\nprocess were investigated in Java[33] under varying conditions. Three\r\nseries of experiments were made:\r\n\r\n[32] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[33] \"Archief voor de Rubbercultuur\" (De Vries and Spoon), Central Rubber\r\nStation, Java, May, 1921.\r\n\r\n     (1) During the rainy monsoon and at a height of 1,800 feet.\r\n\r\n     (2) During the dry monsoon on a low-country estate.\r\n\r\n     (3) In the experimental gardens at Buitenzorg during bright sunny\r\n     weather and the most favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe agents used were (_a_) a mixture of alcohol and fusel oil, (_b_)\r\nalcohol and petrol (benzene).\r\n\r\nIn these experiments no advantage in weight of rubber was obtained by the\r\nIlcken-Down process, and it would thus appear that the principal claim\r\nfails to be substantiated.\r\n\r\nThe general composition of the rubber was approximately the same as\r\nordinary crepe obtained from undiluted latex. The rubber on vulcanisation\r\nwas found to be normal in behaviour, and was similar to the controls.\r\n\r\nThe coagulum ordinarily is affected by oxidation, and does not produce a\r\nfine pale crepe. To remedy this defect the freshly prepared crepe is soaked\r\nin a solution of sodium bisulphite and sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that in the recent experiments coagulation was effected in\r\nvacuum in a specially designed wooden tank. From a study of the previous\r\nsection on \"Spontaneous Coagulation,\" the reader will perceive that results\r\nequal to those obtained by the Ilcken-Down process can be obtained\r\n_without_ the necessity of using such agents as alcohol, petrol, or fusel\r\noil.\r\n\r\nSLAB RUBBER.--This type of preparation has been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion of recent years. There is nothing really special in the mode of\r\npreparation, and in its original form \"slab\" rubber is only a thick sheet\r\nwhich may be obtained by coagulation with acetic acid or other agents.\r\n\r\nThe coagulum, when removed from the serum, is subjected to comparatively\r\nslight pressure, and the \"slab\" thus made is either placed to air-dry at\r\nonce, or may be subject to treatment in other liquids before drying.\r\n\r\nThe rubber is not allowed to remain until wholly dry, but is shipped while\r\nstill containing an appreciable percentage of enclosed moisture.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed[34] that the production of \"slab\" rubber by standardised\r\nmethods eliminates to a great degree the variability which at present\r\ncharacterises plantation rubber, and that a fast-curing medium is obtained.\r\nThese claims will be discussed in later chapters dealing with the\r\nvulcanisation of rubber, and demand no notice in this section.\r\n\r\n[34] \"Preparation and Vulcanisation of Plantation Rubber\" (Eaton, Grantham,\r\nand Day), Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of Agriculture, 1918.\r\n\r\nFrom the producers' point of view, it may be noted that the preparation of\r\nslab rubber is a simple process, but not altogether as pleasant probably as\r\nmight be desired, when undertaken in crude form.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the partially dry slabs is unattractive, but that does\r\nnot signify if the quality of the vulcanised product satisfies\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nFor the average producer, the difficulty lies in having to meet the demands\r\nof the general market. Even, therefore, if one assumes that the intrinsic\r\nqualities of slab rubber are all that the claims advance, it would be\r\nnecessary for the producer to be assured of definite and regular sales.\r\n\r\nAt present it would probably be fair to state that practically all the\r\n\"slab\" rubber being prepared is produced by those who are also consumers.\r\nThey are thus in the enviable position of being able to satisfy their\r\nrequirements as to the mode of preparation. Until such time, therefore, as\r\nthere exists a regular demand for \"slab\" rubber in the general market, the\r\nvast majority of estates must proceed on ordinary lines of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nVULCANISATION\r\n\r\n(BY DR. H. P. STEVENS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_INTRODUCTORY DEALING WITH TREATMENT AND VULCANISATION_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters the methods of treating latex, coagulating,\r\nrolling and curing, or drying, have been described in great detail. These\r\ndetails will give the reader some idea of the precautions taken, and\r\nprocedure necessary to produce rubber which will be acceptable to the\r\nmarket. The expressions \"inferior rubber,\" \"defective crepe,\" \"poor quality\r\nsheets,\" etc., are frequently met with, but these expressions must not be\r\ntaken to indicate any defect in the rubber for manufacturing purposes, but\r\nmerely that the rubber is defective for selling purposes--that is to say,\r\nbeing unsightly, it will not fetch the full market price.\r\n\r\nRaw rubber, as produced on the plantations, is almost invariably subjected\r\nto the process of vulcanisation in the production of manufactured rubber\r\narticles as we know them. Previous to the advent of plantation rubber, the\r\nraw material was purchased by the manufacturer in a moist and impure\r\ncondition; frequently the rubber was adulterated with sand, dirt, and even\r\nsmall stones. Consequently it was the invariable practice of the rubber\r\nmanufacturer to wash the raw rubber and convert it into crepe, which was\r\nthen hung and air-dried before use. The effect on the rubber, if of high\r\ngrade, was more severe than the washing and crepeing process on the\r\nplantation, because the rubber was not a soft coagulum but generally dried\r\non the surface and semi-hard. The power required was considerable, and the\r\nresulting crepe was consequently softer and more susceptible to heat than\r\nplantation first latex crepe. Much of the \"wild\" rubber was soft and tacky\r\nand inferior to \"earth-scrap.\"\r\n\r\nVulcanising in its simplest aspect consists in mixing the rubber with\r\nsulphur and heating the product under regulated conditions. The effect of\r\nheat on the inferior grades of \"wild\" rubber is very marked. A soft,\r\nsticky, and resinous material is transformed into a relatively tough and\r\nelastic product. The effect of vulcanising on the better grades is less\r\nmarked, but immediately apparent. On the other hand, the effect of\r\nvulcanising is least apparent on first latex plantation grades, because in\r\nthese we have a raw rubber prepared in a manner best suited to retain its\r\nnatural characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe need of vulcanising in the process of manufacturing rubber goods became\r\nan axiom in pre-plantation days, and it is only quite recently that\r\nattempts have been made to utilise raw rubber directly, without\r\nvulcanisation, particularly for shoe soles. For this purpose a thick dense\r\ncrepe has been found satisfactory. Smoked sheet rubber is not generally\r\nsuitable, apparently owing to its microphysical structure. It is possible\r\nthat the process of rolling in the making of dense crepe compacts the\r\nrubber particles, yielding a harder and more resilient product. The rolling\r\nmust not be carried too far, or the \"working\" of the rubber will\r\napproximate to a preliminary mastication, and the product will be weakened.\r\n\r\nThe utilisation of crepe rubber directly has not yet been sufficiently\r\ntested to enable a definite conclusion to be reached as to its future\r\nscope, but it is obvious that for use in a raw state some modification in\r\npreparation may be advantageous. The present method--_e.g._, coagulation\r\nwith acetic acid--does not yield the hardest and toughest rubber.\r\n\r\nHardness and toughness are actual drawbacks in the utilisation of rubber\r\nwhich is required for vulcanising. When the output of plantation rubber\r\nbegan to increase and to displace the inferior wild sorts, manufacturers\r\ncomplained of the increased power consumption of their machines. The power\r\nwas required mainly to \"break down\" or \"mill\" the rubber preliminary to the\r\nmixing with sulphur and other ingredients. It is obvious that a material\r\nsuch as raw rubber cannot be mixed with powders such as sulphur with a\r\npestle and mortar, or in any simple form of mixing machine. This difficulty\r\nwas overcome by the earlier experimenters by immersing the rubber in a bath\r\nof molten sulphur. The latter was gradually absorbed and \"dissolved\" in the\r\nrubber, and the heat of the bath caused the dissolved sulphur to combine\r\nwith the rubber to produce vulcanised rubber. The limitations of such a\r\nprocess are apparent. Thus the vulcanised rubber retains the form in which\r\nit was originally shaped. Moreover, other ingredients, such as mineral\r\nmatters, cannot be dissolved or absorbed by the rubber in this manner. The\r\nmethod eventually adopted consisted in \"breaking down,\" \"milling,\" or\r\n\"masticating\" the rubber by passing it continuously between differentially\r\ngeared steam-heated rollers. By this means a high-grade rubber is converted\r\ninto a soft, plastic mass, which will \"take up\" sulphur, mineral matter,\r\nand other ingredients as desired. The mixing operation may be carried\r\nthrough on the same roller machine as was used for breaking down the\r\nrubber, or separate machines of other designs may be adopted. Details of\r\nthe process will be found in books dealing with rubber manufacturing.[35]\r\nIt will suffice here to explain that when rubber is kneaded between two hot\r\nrollers moving at different speeds the rubber forms a continuous band\r\naround the slower moving roller, and if the distance between the rollers be\r\nadjusted the excess of rubber held back by the nip of the rollers will form\r\na \"bank\" or moving wedge-shaped mass on the top of the nip. This closes the\r\nspace between the rollers, so that sulphur and powder placed on the rubber\r\npass round towards the nip, and are there driven into the rubber. In this\r\nmanner it is easy to mix, say, 10 per cent. of sulphur into the rubber\r\nwithout a single particle falling through. In technical mixes where large\r\nquantities of powders require to be mixed there is always some caking, and\r\npart of the powder falls between the rollers into a tray underneath. This\r\nis swept up with a broom and put back on to the rollers, the process being\r\nrepeated until the whole of the ingredients have been incorporated.\r\n\r\n[35] For instance, \"India-Rubber and its Manufacture,\" by H. L. Terry.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it follows that, preliminary to mixing, it is\r\nnecessary to thoroughly masticate or \"plasticise\" the raw rubber. Much of\r\nthe \"wild\" rubber was of so inferior a quality that it very readily broke\r\ndown, and but little mastication was necessary. It was soft and resinous,\r\nand readily took up the powders which were to be mixed with it. The better\r\ngrades of wild rubber, such as Fine Para, were more difficult to break\r\ndown, but not so difficult as most plantation rubber, because they had\r\nalready received a preliminary \"working\" in the process of washing and\r\ncrepeing, and we have already explained that such treatment takes more\r\npower than the crepeing of the soft moist coagulum on the plantations. The\r\namount of \"working\" or \"plasticising\" produced in the rubber is connected\r\nwith the power expended; the greater the expenditure of power, _caeteris\r\nparibus_, the greater the working effect on the rubber. Although the\r\nmanufacturers possessed a relatively soft rubber in the form of washed Fine\r\nPara, it was customary in most cases to employ this rubber in conjunction\r\nwith washed lower grades to produce a soft plastic material for further\r\ntreatment. Now, however, the manufacturer has little else but plantation to\r\ndeal with, and most of it more difficult to break down than washed Para\r\ncrepe. This is the reason why a hard, tough rubber is no longer a\r\ndesideratum with manufacturers, although originally taken as an indication\r\nof good quality. For the majority of purposes they want something which\r\nwill break down easily. Hence if a rubber could be produced answering to\r\nthese requirements, without loss of vulcanising quality, it would be\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nHaving incorporated sulphur and other ingredients, the plastic mass is\r\nsheeted and run between layers of calico to prevent the superimposed sheets\r\nfrom adhering. From this \"calendered sheet\" the article, whatever it may\r\nbe, is built up. The calender rollers are heated so as to keep the rubber\r\ncompound plastic. There is a limit to the thickness of the sheet which can\r\nbe produced. It is a difficult operation to perform satisfactorily so as\r\nto yield a smooth surface and a sheet free from enclosed air. When cool the\r\nrubber hardens and is readily handled. The object to be manufactured is\r\nthen built up from the calendered sheet. Thus in the manufacture of a motor\r\ntyre the tread is built up on the casing or carcase by laying the sheets on\r\nthe canvas and rolling these with a hand or power operated roller, so that\r\nthey adhere firmly, the first layer to the canvas of the casing and\r\nsubsequent layers to one another. This rough description will suffice to\r\nillustrate how important it is that the rubber when mixed should be plastic\r\nenough to give a smooth sheet, and to allow the sheet to be manipulated in\r\nbuilding up the article in process of manufacture. The testing of rubber in\r\nregard to its plasticity and power to absorb finely divided mineral matter\r\nwill be discussed in a later chapter. We may, however, point out here, that\r\nthe mineral matter is not generally added as an adulterant, but because of\r\ncertain specific properties it confers on the product.\r\n\r\nTo proceed with our outline of vulcanisation, we have now arrived at the\r\nstage at which the goods are built up and ready for vulcanising. For this\r\npurpose they are generally enclosed in some manner, either in metal moulds\r\nbolted together, or tightly wrapped in cloth, as, _e.g._, in the\r\nmanufacture of inner tubes, hose, etc. In the latter case, you can detect\r\nthe cloth mark on the finished product. Sometimes the rubber is\r\nspewed--that is, driven out of a barrel by means of an endless screw\r\nrevolving in it. In this way rubber tubing, perambulator tyres, and such\r\narticles, may be made. More recently even tyre treads and the shaped rubber\r\nfor band tyres (heavy solid tyres) have been extruded in this manner, for\r\nthe process is much cheaper than building up a tyre from calendered sheet,\r\nand then cutting the mass to shape by hand. But for spewing the rubber mass\r\nmust be very soft and plastic; this condition is not obtainable unless the\r\nraw rubber originally used can be made thoroughly plastic without damage.\r\nNor can it be effected with a rubber mass containing much finely divided\r\nmineral matter, as this hardens the mixture.\r\n\r\nFor other purposes the rubber is swollen in a solvent, such as coal-tar\r\nnaphtha, and subsequently masticated; the soft dough is then shaped or\r\nspread on cloth, and vulcanised after allowing the solvent to evaporate.\r\nHere, again, the properties of the raw rubber are of immense importance.\r\nThus, the more plastic the dough, the less solvent required, and the less\r\nthere is to drive off before vulcanising. The plasticity of the dough will\r\ndepend on the plasticity of the raw rubber, and so forth. It is evident\r\nthat the physical properties of the raw rubber are of great importance.\r\nThey directly affect the manufacturing operations up to the vulcanising\r\nstage, and indirectly affect the results obtained on vulcanising.\r\n\r\nThe actual vulcanising consists of heating the mass of mixed rubber for\r\na definite time and at a definite temperature, each \"heat\" being chosen\r\nto suit the particular mixture. These data are arrived at\r\nempirically--that is, by trying a number of \"heats\" and choosing that\r\nwhich appears the most suitable. The suitability will depend on the\r\nnature of the article, the service to which it is to be put, and the\r\ntime it is intended to last. All vulcanised rubber goods, whatever the\r\nprocess, have a limited life or period during which they can be relied\r\non to give useful service. After a time, vulcanised rubber tends to\r\nharden, cracks appear on the surface when the article is bent or\r\nstretched, and eventually the rubber becomes rotten and \"perished.\" This\r\ntendency varies with the quality of the original raw rubber and the\r\nconditions of vulcanising. Before plantation rubber was available, the\r\nmanufacturers were dependent on inferior wild grades for a great part of\r\ntheir output, and, consequently, the goods made from these inferior\r\nrubbers never showed very good mechanical properties and soon\r\ndeteriorated. The severest critics of plantation rubber have admitted\r\nthe advantages to the manufacturers of the replacement of the lower wild\r\ngrades by plantation rubber.[36] But even the best grades give a\r\nvulcanised product which rapidly deteriorates if the vulcanisation is\r\ncarried too far. This results from too long heating, or too high a\r\ntemperature, and the product is termed \"overvulcanised\" or\r\n\"overcured.\"[37] The appearance of the product is deceptive, as the\r\nphysical properties are remarkably good if the overvulcanising is not\r\nmore than 50 to 100 per cent. in excess of the normal cure. Only in the\r\ncase of very much overvulcanised rubber do we obtain a product which is\r\nbrittle from the beginning.\r\n\r\n[36] See Williams, \"The Rubber Industry,\" 1914, p. 284. It must also be\r\nremembered that the inferior wild grades were derived from latices often\r\ncontaining a large proportion of \"resinous\" matter, and which could not\r\nyield a really high grade of vulcanised rubber whatever the care and skill\r\nemployed in preparation.\r\n\r\n[37] The terms \"curing\" and \"vulcanising\" are generally employed as if\r\nsynonymous. Twiss has suggested that the former be applied in regard to a\r\nchange in physical properties, and the latter to the chemical change\r\nwhereby sulphur is combined with the rubber. The term \"curing\" is also\r\napplied to the process of preparation of raw rubber. This must be kept in\r\nmind so as to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nThe degree of vulcanising will vary with the type of article to be\r\nproduced, and where a long life is desired, the tendency will be to\r\n\"undervulcanise\"; but if the best mechanical properties are desired, the\r\ntendency will be towards \"overvulcanising,\" or, more correctly, \"fully\"\r\nvulcanising. These considerations are aptly illustrated by reference to\r\npneumatic tyres. The inner tube need not possess high tensile strength,\r\nprovided that it is easily distensible, for the reason that, during use, it\r\nis protected by the casing of the tyre proper, which confines and supports\r\nit against the air-pressure applied. Inner tubes are therefore cured to\r\ngive a long life without developing the maximal physical properties. On the\r\nother hand, the casing and tread of the tyre are required to withstand\r\nsevere mechanical conditions--particularly the constant flexing of the\r\ncover, and the abrasion of the road surface. Tyres are not stored for any\r\nlong period, and, when put into service, have a limited period of useful\r\nlife. Consequently it is needful to develop maximal mechanical properties,\r\nand vulcanisation is therefore carried further than in the manufacture of\r\ninner tubes.\r\n\r\nThe rate of cure is controlled by a number of factors in addition to the\r\nperiod and temperature of vulcanisation, in particular by the proportion\r\nand nature of the other ingredients, especially sulphur and accelerators,\r\nand also by the rubber itself. The main complaint as regards plantation\r\nrubber is that it varies excessively in this respect. This matter will not\r\nbe discussed here, but is only introduced in order to explain the\r\nimportance of a constant rate of vulcanising to the manufacturer.\r\nPlantation rubber should, therefore, be prepared so as to be as uniform as\r\npossible in this respect, and the earlier part of this book gives full\r\ndetails of the precautions advised, and in many cases adopted on the\r\nplantations. Unfortunately, it is impossible to secure uniformity of\r\nmethods among all producers, even when they are Europeans, to say nothing\r\nof the native producers, who account for perhaps one-third of the output.\r\nHence the importance of branding the rubber whenever possible, so that the\r\nmanufacturer may identify the rubber he purchases. If found satisfactory,\r\nhe can then secure further supplies from the same estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_TESTING OF PLANTATION RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject may be subdivided into (_a_) Tests on the raw rubber; (_b_)\r\ntests on the vulcanised rubber.\r\n\r\nThe tests on the raw rubber may be carried out (1) on the sample of sheet\r\nand crepe as received. For this purpose the rubber is cut into a strip,\r\nwhich is clamped between grips and gradually stretched to breaking-point.\r\nThe ring testing machine can be adapted for this purpose by replacing the\r\nrollers with clamps. As the thickness of the samples to be tested will\r\nvary, it is advisable to cut the strips of such a width that the\r\ncross-sectional area of all test pieces is the same--say, 40 sq. mm. The\r\nmethod is applicable to both sheet and crepe rubber. (2) Tests may be made\r\nas to the behaviour of the rubber during milling or mastication. Small\r\nbatches are milled under uniform conditions, preferably in an enclosed\r\nmasticator such as Baker and Perkins supply. The power taken (as measured\r\nby the current taken to drive the motor actuating the machine) and the time\r\nare recorded. A further test may be applied to the milled or masticated\r\nrubber, to ascertain the amount and the time taken to incorporate a finely\r\ndivided mineral matter, such as carbon black, zinc oxide, or one of the\r\nrefined clays.[38] The results are not very exact, and the difference in\r\nplasticity and dryness noted are usually less than found when working with\r\nfull-sized machines in the factory. (3) The rubber, either raw or\r\nmasticated, may be \"dissolved\" in a \"solvent,\" such as benzene, and the\r\nviscosity of the \"solution\" measured. Generally speaking, the less viscous\r\nthe solution, the more plastic the rubber.\r\n\r\n[38] Bulletin Rubber Growers' Association, January, 1921, p. 43; August,\r\n1921, p. 340.\r\n\r\nThe testing of vulcanised rubber has been treated in such detail in the\r\nrecent works of Whitby[39] and De Vries[40] that a few special points only\r\nwill be dealt with here. The preparation of samples for testing involves\r\nfirst the sheeting of the mixture of rubber, sulphur, and other\r\ningredients, if any. The sheets may be 1 to 2 mm. thick. They are soft and\r\nadherent, and must be kept between layers of calico to prevent adhesion. A\r\nsheet of rubber is then built up by laying three or four sheets evenly upon\r\none another, and pressing together to form a sheet 5 mm. thick. The thick\r\nsheet is then roughly cut to shape and vulcanised in a mould by heating in\r\nsteam under pressure. From the vulcanised sheet so obtained the rings for\r\ntesting are cut (45 mm. internal diameter. 5 mm. face, and 4 mm. thick).\r\nRings obtained in this manner will not vary in diameter or thickness\r\n(reckoned as sections of a tube), as these are controlled by the size of\r\nthe punch, but will vary a little in the face, as this is controlled by the\r\nthickness of the sheet, which depends on the completeness with which the\r\nmould is closed. More recently smaller moulds have been adopted, one mould\r\nfor each ring, and an annular space for moisture to develop a pressure\r\nduring vulcanising and prevent porosity. The moulds are vulcanised in an\r\noil bath, or oven of some description, in which a constant temperature is\r\nmaintained. I have adopted for some years a third method. The principle is\r\nthat used in the factory for making annular-shaped rubber articles, such as\r\nwashers, rings, elastic bands, etc. An aluminium mandrel, 45 mm. external\r\ndiameter, is taken, and the thin rubber sheet is wrapped round this, so as\r\nto build up a tube about 4 mm. thick, the surplus rubber is cut off, and\r\nthe edge bevelled with a wet knife. The manipulation will vary somewhat\r\nwith the type of compound to be treated; thus, in some cases, it is\r\nsufficient to well roll the tube with a hand roller to secure adhesion. In\r\nother cases it is better to wipe the sheet of compound with a rubber\r\nsolvent previous to rolling. In the latter case time must be given for the\r\nsolvent to evaporate before vulcanising. The tube is next tightly wrapped\r\nin wet cloth, and is then ready for the vulcaniser. Or the tube may be\r\nenclosed in moulds which form an outer circular shell and take the place of\r\nthe cloth, but for most purposes, and in particular for the rubber-sulphur\r\nmixing usually employed, it is sufficient to use cloth to obtain even and\r\nregular tubes. The tube, after vulcanising, is slipped on to a wooden\r\nmandrel and cut into rings on a lathe. Of these rings the internal diameter\r\nis constant, for this is formed on the mandrel, also the face, which can be\r\ncut accurately in the lathe, but the external diameter, and consequently\r\nthe thickness, may vary a little.\r\n\r\n[39] \"Plantation Rubber and the Testing of Rubber.\"\r\n\r\n[40] \"Estate Rubber.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that all methods result in rings of approximately\r\nthe correct size, and it is usual to check, and, if necessary, make an\r\nallowance for variation in dimensions. It is not possible to do this, even\r\napproximately, with soft rubbers, as the rubber gives under the pressure of\r\nthe micrometer. No doubt a photographic method would give more accurate\r\nresults, but would take too long. I have found that a very close\r\napproximation is obtainable by weighing the rings as the specific gravity\r\nof the standard rubber mix is known. It is not necessary to weigh each\r\nring, but the whole five or ten taken for testing may be weighed together.\r\n\r\nThe next point that arises is the choice of a formula for the test mix.\r\nPractically all the work to date has been carried out on mixtures of rubber\r\nwith 7 to 10 per cent. of sulphur. For some purposes--_e.g._, detecting\r\nvariation in rate of cure--this mixing is satisfactory, but for other\r\npurposes it is not. Nor is the behaviour of a rubber-sulphur mixing a sure\r\nguide to the behaviour of one containing other ingredients, such as\r\nlitharge. Thus, two samples vulcanised satisfactorily when mixed with\r\nsulphur only, but one of them gave unsatisfactory results in the presence\r\nof litharge. It has long been recognised that mineral ingredients may\r\nmodify the product when vulcanised, but the modification is not necessarily\r\nuniform. Consequently, tests should also be made, when practicable, with\r\nvulcanised rubber containing other ingredients in addition to sulphur.\r\n\r\nAs regards physical tests on the vulcanised products, these usually involve\r\ndetermination of breaking load and elongation at rupture (usually recorded\r\nas final length--that is, including the original length reckoned either as\r\nunity or as 100 units). Simultaneously a load-stretch curve is recorded on\r\nan autographic attachment. The type of curve varies with (1) state of cure,\r\nor degree to which the rubber is vulcanised; (2) proportion of sulphur\r\nand/or other ingredients; (3) specific nature of the rubber used. The last\r\nfactor is almost negligible compared with the two former--at any rate for\r\naverage quality rubber. As (2) is kept constant for any batch of tests, or\r\neven for every test, it follows that the load-stretch curve is mainly\r\ndependent on the state of cure, and the degree of vulcanising may be\r\nmeasured by comparing either the elongation produced at a given load or the\r\nload produced at a given elongation. Either set of figures is readily\r\ndetermined by measuring up the load-stretch diagram.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar type of the curves has long been a subject of comment and\r\nspeculation. Special properties have been attributed to the \"slope\" or\r\ninclination of the upper and approximately straight portion of the curve.\r\nAccording to the writer's investigations, the \"slope\" is largely dependent\r\non the degree of vulcanisation, so that it is difficult to \"place\" as an\r\nindex of the specific nature of a rubber.[41] Moreover, it has recently\r\nbeen shown that the peculiar type of curve given by vulcanised rubber is\r\nthe result of plotting the load against the sectional area of the\r\nunstretched test piece, whereas this area decreases progressively as the\r\ntest piece stretches. If this decrease be allowed for, the curve obtained\r\nis an equilateral hyperbola.[42] Preliminary experiments with rubber\r\ncompounded with large proportions of finely divided mineral matter, such as\r\ncarbon black, show that the load-stretch curves obtained autographically\r\nare likewise reducible to equilateral hyperbolae.\r\n\r\n[41] Bulletin R.G.A., October, 1921, p. 397.\r\n\r\n[42] _Hatschek Journal Soc. Chem. Ind._ 1921; _Trans._, p. 251.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_THE PROPERTIES OF RUBBER_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis section, like the last, is divisible into two subsections. The first\r\ndeals with raw rubber, the second with vulcanised rubber.\r\n\r\nWe have already explained that, until recently, rubber was not used in the\r\nunvulcanised condition, but that the excellent physical properties of\r\nplantation rubber have made this possible. It is interesting to compare the\r\nphysical properties of raw rubber with that vulcanised with sulphur. A\r\ncompact sample of crepe as received from the East will give breaking strain\r\nof over 30 kilos per sq. cm. and over 300 per cent. elongation. When mixed\r\nwith sulphur and vulcanised, a breaking strain of 150 kilos and elongation\r\nof 1,000 per cent. are not unusual. It is possible that crepe rubber would\r\ngive higher figures if it could be prepared in the form of a compact ring,\r\nas used for tests on vulcanised rubber. In any case, the figures for\r\nvulcanised rubber are much in excess of those for raw crepe rubber. It must\r\nalso be remembered that a breaking strain of 150 kilos is not permanent\r\nwith vulcanised rubber, for reasons which will be explained later.[43] To\r\nobtain a reasonably permanent vulcanised product, the vulcanisation would\r\nnot be carried further than to give a figure of 100 kilos. On the other\r\nhand, raw rubber is remarkable on account of its great permanency, although\r\nsubject to some physical changes at ordinary atmospheric temperatures.\r\nTensile tests, although valuable, do not tell us all about the physical\r\nproperties of a sample of rubber. Abrasion tests, or tests designed to\r\nmeasure resistance to wear and tear, would be more valuable, but,\r\nunfortunately, these properties do not lend themselves to simple tests.\r\nThere are grounds for believing that raw rubber is superior in some\r\nrespects to fully vulcanised rubber, if prepared without the addition of\r\nfinely divided mineral substances which exert a toughening effect.\r\n\r\n[43] _Journal Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1916, p. 872.\r\n\r\nSheet rubber gives results in some ways inferior to compact crepe rubber\r\nwhen subjected to physical tests. Tensile strength seldom exceeds 15 kilos,\r\nbut the elongation is usually higher--up to 600 or 700 per cent. That is to\r\nsay, it stretches more, but breaks more easily. If, however, we take into\r\nconsideration the diminution in sectional area of the test piece during\r\nstretching, it will be seen that crepe and sheet rubber have compensating\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nAs this matter of sectional area reduction during stretching is important,\r\nboth for raw and vulcanised rubber, it may be briefly referred to here.\r\nWhen rubber is stretched, the volume does not appreciably alter--at any\r\nrate, as regards uncompounded rubber. Hence the reduction of sectional area\r\non stretching bears a simple relationship to the amount of stretching. If\r\nwe double the length of the test piece, we halve the sectional area; if we\r\ntreble the length, we reduce it to one-third, and so forth. Hence, if we\r\nmultiply the breaking strain by the final length (_i.e._, length at break,\r\ntaking the original length = 1), we obtain a figure, the \"tensile product,\"\r\nwhich embodies both breaking strain and stretching capacity. In effect it\r\ngives us the breaking strain calculated on the sectional area at the\r\n_moment of rupture_ of the test piece. Adopting this formula, we obtain for\r\ncrepe--\r\n\r\n   _Tensile    _Final Length--i.e.,    _Tensile\r\n  Strength._     Elongation + 1._      Product._\r\n     30      x        4            =     120\r\n\r\nand for smoked sheet\r\n\r\n     15      x        8            =     120\r\n\r\nThe difference in properties between crepe and sheet may probably be\r\nattributed to the heavier rolling of the crepe; which compacts the rubber.\r\nBut if the crepe is rolled too much, the tensile strength falls, and there\r\nis no increased elongation to compensate. For the same reason, crepe which\r\nhas been rerolled in this country is inferior to crepe as received direct\r\nfrom the plantation. At the most it is permissible to unite two or three\r\nlayers of thin crepe to a thicker one by a single passage through even\r\nspeed rollers, if the physical properties of the original rubber are to be\r\nconserved.[44]\r\n\r\n[44] Bulletin R.G.A., February, 1922, p. 64.\r\n\r\nAttempts to prepare crepe for use in a raw state, by rerolling uneven or\r\nirregular surfaced crepe in this country, only result in a rubber with\r\ninferior physical properties. Nor can sheet be rerolled to give crepe of\r\ngood physical properties. The power required to break down the sheet and\r\nthe heat developed, even on cold rollers, are an indication of physical\r\nproperties destroyed. For subsequent vulcanisation this is not a matter of\r\nimportance, because the vulcanising process restores to the rubber the\r\nproperties which are lost in the process of rolling and milling or\r\nmastication.\r\n\r\nRaw rubber has been used to some extent for proofing purposes, as for the\r\nmanufacture of material for hoods of motor-cars. In this case no attempt is\r\nmade to preserve the physical properties. The rubber is masticated, mixed,\r\ntaken up with solvent and spread on the cloth exactly as if it were to be\r\nvulcanised.\r\n\r\nVULCANISED RUBBER.--We have already explained that the properties of\r\nvulcanised rubber are dependent, to some extent, on the specific nature of\r\nthe raw rubber, or what De Vries terms the \"inner qualities.\" That is to\r\nsay, differences appear on vulcanising which are not apparent from the\r\ntests made on the raw rubber. Indeed, no investigation or analysis of the\r\nraw rubber can enable one to foresee exactly how the rubber will behave on\r\nvulcanisation. This illustrates the deficiency in our knowledge of\r\nvulcanisation. When dealing with soft, resinous, or decomposed rubbers, it\r\nis safe to anticipate a weak vulcanised product; but when we come to deal\r\nwith a number of samples of \"standard\" crepe or sheet--_i.e._, sheet or\r\ncrepe passing a certain standard of appearance--it is found that\r\ndifferences in vulcanising properties cannot be foreseen. This matter is,\r\nhowever, not so great a drawback as might be imagined, for reasonably well\r\nprepared consignments of standard crepe or sheet differ but little from\r\none another, and the difference is mainly in the ease with which they break\r\ndown, or the rate or speed with which they vulcanise, and not with the\r\nproperties of the vulcanised product. Many of the plantation scrap grades\r\nare equal to or nearly equal to \"standard\"; but some of these, as also the\r\nrubber produced by native holders, show appreciable variation, and are the\r\nsource of most of the complaints which emanate from manufacturers. We shall\r\nconsider in turn the different grades and the effect of the usual surface\r\ndefects, such as mould, spots, etc.\r\n\r\nCREPE RUBBER.--Oil marks and tackiness are the most serious defects from\r\nthe manufacturing standpoint. In the first part of this book we have shown\r\nthat damage caused by the so-called oil marks is not due to the oil, but to\r\ntraces of copper from the bearings of the machines. There are several\r\nmetallic compounds which cause deterioration of rubber both raw and\r\nvulcanised, but copper is the most deadly, and rubber showing signs of\r\ndeterioration is rightly rejected by the manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe only other defect of crepe rubber which has any bearing on its use in\r\nmanufacture is mould. Crepe rubber very seldom shows the ordinary surface\r\nmoulds not uncommon in sheet-rubber. There are, however, microscopic\r\ngrowths which cause the development of coloured spots referred to in detail\r\nin the earlier part of this book. The rubber hydrocarbon itself does not\r\nappear to be affected by the moulds, but some of the serum constituents are\r\naltered, with the result that the rubber vulcanises more slowly than it\r\notherwise would do. For this reason, crepe rubber with coloured spots may\r\ngive rise to trouble in the factory.\r\n\r\nSHEET RUBBER.--The commonest defect is mould.[45] This is usually of a\r\nlight surface type, easily brushed off, and numbers of vulcanising tests\r\nfailed to trace any reduction in rate of vulcanising or other defect due to\r\nthis. In spite, however, of the harmlessness of light surface moulds, they\r\nare looked upon with suspicion by the manufacturer. Occasionally samples of\r\nsmoked sheet are offered contaminated with a \"heavy\" type of mould. The\r\nsheet feels damp and \"heavy\" or flabby, and contains an excess of moisture;\r\nsometimes a moist exudation is noticeable on the surface, and \"virgin\"\r\npatches are present. Such sheet vulcanises more slowly than F.A.Q. samples,\r\nbut does not necessarily show other defects after washing and drying.\r\n\r\n[45] Bulletin R.G.A., February, 1921, p. 97; April, 1921, p. 190; June,\r\n1921, p. 243; November, 1921, p. 472.\r\n\r\n\"Stretching rusty,\" as already explained, is due to a dry film on the\r\nsurface of the sheet, and according to a recent investigation, this film\r\nconsists, not of serum substances, but of a microscopic mould growth, which\r\npresumably grows on the serum substances. A sample of sheet which stretches\r\nrusty gives the rubber a \"dry\" appearance, and for a long time\r\nmanufacturers mistook the surface film for resin. On the assumption that\r\nsuch rubber was \"resinous\" they rejected it, and to this day it is regarded\r\nas a defect, although it has no influence on the vulcanising properties of\r\nthe rubber.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out that defective appearance, such as is\r\ndue to thickened edges, faint markings, bubbles, and so forth, have no\r\neffect on the vulcanising properties of the rubber. They only point to some\r\nirregularity or carelessness in preparation. The only justification for\r\ndistinguishing between rubber of good and bad appearance is that the former\r\nbears the impress of careful preparation, and is therefore more likely to\r\nbe uniform in rate of vulcanising.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations apply to the colour of smoked sheet, which may vary\r\nfrom a pale yellow-brown, through various shades of red-brown to dark\r\nbrown. There are various factors affecting the colour, but the buyer can\r\nsee but one--viz., the \"degree\" of smoking--and the rubber, from his point\r\nof view, may be undersmoked or oversmoked. No doubt the degree of smoking\r\naffects the vulcanising properties, but to a less extent than was at one\r\ntime imagined. In a recent paper[46] it has been shown that the average\r\nbreaking strain and rate of cure of a number of samples of smoked sheets\r\nwere practically the same for light as for dark sheets.\r\n\r\n[46] Bulletin R.G.A., December, 1921, p. 521.\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.--A very large number of tests on\r\nvulcanised specimens of plantation rubber have been carried out. The\r\nrubber was almost invariably mixed with 7 to 10 per cent. of sulphur, and\r\nno other ingredient, and vulcanised to give the maximal breaking load.\r\nUnfortunately, this determination is subject to a very appreciable\r\nexperimental error, so that a large number of determinations are necessary\r\nto give a reliable figure. It is quite impracticable to make a large number\r\nof determinations in routine testing, on account of the labour involved. It\r\nis usual to make five, or possibly ten, determinations, although some\r\ninvestigators have been content with two. It is generally conceded that any\r\nexceptionally low figures should be ignored, as probably caused by some\r\nflaw or irregularity in the test piece. On the other hand, a study of\r\nactual determinations shows an occasional excessively high figure, and it\r\nis questioned whether this also should be left out of account. Others\r\nignore all except the highest figure, and take this to represent the true\r\nbreaking strain. As a consequence, the figures published by different\r\nworkers show considerable variation. De Vries has analysed a large number\r\nof the figures obtained in systematic examination of estate samples, and\r\nhas constructed curves to illustrate the results.[47] It is open to\r\nquestion how far the variations shown are attributable to experimental\r\nerror. The figures show, however, that the variation in breaking strain is\r\nrelatively small, and not very different for crepe and sheet rubber. In our\r\nopinion, undue importance should not be attached to very high or\r\nexceptionally high figures for breaking strain, which are occasionally met\r\nwith. Provided the figure does not fall much below the average, the sample\r\nmay be regarded as satisfactory. It is very seldom that any sample of first\r\nlatex estate rubber does not show satisfactory figures.\r\n\r\n[47] \"Estate Rubber,\" p. 466.\r\n\r\nTHE RATE OF CURE OR RATE OF VULCANISATION is subject to more exact\r\nmeasurement, whether this be based on the physical or the chemical\r\nproperties of the rubber. If the testing machine be provided, as is usual,\r\nwith an autographic attachment, the position of the curves traced on the\r\nrecording paper gives a measurement of the rate of cure. These load-stretch\r\ncurves, to which reference has already been made, take up a definite\r\nposition in accordance with the physical properties; it is only the length\r\nof the curve, or the point where it terminates (which gives the breaking\r\nstrain and elongation at break), which is largely fortuitous.\r\n\r\nAs a measure of rate of cure we may take the actual measurements made on\r\nthe record.[48] It is convenient to measure the elongation produced by a\r\nload of 130 kilos per sq. cm., as all fully vulcanised rings of soft rubber\r\nshould give higher breaking load figures. For less cured or weaker samples\r\na lower figure may be taken, such as 60 kilos. We have found that when\r\nfully vulcanised to give the maximal breaking strain, the elongation at a\r\nload of 130 kilos is in the neighbourhood of 850 per cent. (final length\r\n950 per cent.). This applies to ordinary samples of estate rubber under the\r\nconditions of testing indicated above. If, however, the proportion of\r\nsulphur be considerably reduced, or mineral ingredients in a fine state of\r\ndivision be added to the mixing, or accelerators, whether organic or\r\ninorganic, be employed, the above relationship no longer holds. Nor does it\r\nhold with regard to plantation rubber prepared in an exceptional manner,\r\nas, for instance, matured coagulum or \"slab.\"\r\n\r\n[48] Bulletin R.G.A., June, 1921, p. 246.\r\n\r\nThere is a second method of determining the rate of cure--namely, by\r\nanalysing a vulcanisate produced under standard conditions, and determining\r\nthe amount of sulphur which has entered into chemical combination with the\r\nrubber. For this purpose the weighed sample is cut thin or creped thin, and\r\nexhaustively extracted with acetone to remove any \"free\" sulphur--that is,\r\nsulphur not in combination with the rubber. The sulphur remaining is then\r\ndetermined and calculated as a percentage of the raw rubber contained in\r\nthe sample taken. This gives the so-called coefficient of vulcanisation.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the coefficient with the time of cure at a constant\r\ntemperature for an ordinary sample of plantation rubber, they are found to\r\nbe approximately proportional, so long as the sulphur is in sufficient\r\nexcess. The amount of combined sulphur is, therefore, an index of the time\r\nvulcanisation has been in progress (under standard conditions of\r\ntemperature, etc.), and, therefore, the coefficient is a measure of the\r\nrate of cure.\r\n\r\nThe change in position of the load-stretch curve is not directly\r\nproportional to the time of heating, and it therefore follows that it is\r\nalso not directly proportional to the coefficient. For ordinary samples of\r\ncrepe and sheet the relationship is, however, not very far removed from\r\nproportionality. This applies particularly to sheet rubber. The\r\nrelationship is readily seen on plotting one against the other and tracing\r\nthe curves. For sheet we get an almost straight line; for crepe there is\r\nsome curvature.[49] For ordinary estate samples of sheet and crepe rubber\r\nthe maximal breaking strain is obtained when the coefficient reaches\r\napproximately five units, so that this corresponds to the elongation of 850\r\nper cent. at a load of 130 kilos.\r\n\r\n[49] Bulletin R.G.A., June, 1921, p. 246, October, 1921, p. 398.\r\n\r\nEither physical or chemical methods may, therefore, be used for determining\r\nthe rate of cure of ordinary sheet or crepe rubber, but great care must be\r\ntaken when interpreting the results obtained with rubber prepared in an\r\nunusual manner. The rate of cure may be expressed in terms of the time\r\ntaken to vulcanise the rubber at a constant temperature (in our case 138 deg.\r\nC.), so as to give an elongation of 850 per cent. at a load of 130 kilos,\r\nor to give a coefficient of five units. The higher the figure so obtained,\r\nthe slower curing the rubber. To express the results more directly as rate\r\nof cure, we have adopted the plan of taking an average crepe rubber,\r\ncalling the rate of cure 100 units, and expressing the rate of cure of\r\nother samples in these terms. Thus, a sample which gave a coefficient of\r\nfour only, in the time taken by the standard to give a coefficient of five,\r\nwould have a rate of cure four-fifths of the standard, that is, 80; or if a\r\nsample takes only two hours to give an elongation of 850 per cent., whereas\r\nthe standard takes three hours, the rate of cure of the sample will be 3/2\r\nof standard or 150.[50]\r\n\r\n[50] _Journal Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1918, p. 280.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the coefficient is approximately directly proportional to the\r\ntime of cure; it is also independent of the proportion of sulphur, if in\r\nfair excess, and in the presence of inert ingredients. It is also\r\nindependent of the amount of mastication given to the original raw rubber,\r\nhowever great. On the other hand, the position of the load-stretch curve is\r\nvariously modified by these factors--in some respects, therefore, the\r\ncoefficient is a more reliable index. However, the coefficient is\r\ninfluenced by accelerators, so that here also great care must be exercised\r\nwhen interpreting results. For the purpose of detecting variations in rate\r\nof cure, it is best to choose a mixing which is particularly sensitive. In\r\nthe first place, there must be an ample excess of sulphur; and in the\r\nsecond place, no ingredient should be added which will complicate the\r\nload-stretch curves, and no accelerators should be present which may\r\npossibly tend to obscure the vulcanising properties of the rubber itself.\r\nIt has been found, therefore, that the best mixing to use consists of\r\nrubber with an excess of sulphur--say, in the proportion 9:1 without other\r\ningredients. The rate of cure of a specimen of plantation rubber is\r\nattributed to the presence of certain natural vulcanising catalysts,\r\nbecause it is found that carefully purified raw rubber (that is, with the\r\nresinous and nitrogenous constituents removed) vulcanises very slowly or\r\nhardly at all, but that on replacing the extracted matter the rate of\r\nvulcanising is restored. The natural catalysts contained in the extracted\r\nmatter are influenced to a varying degree by some of the common ingredients\r\nof manufactured rubber articles. This applies particularly to litharge\r\n(oxide of lead), to which reference has already been made. Thus, acetone\r\nextraction of raw rubber to remove resinous matter has but little effect on\r\nthe vulcanising properties of a mixture of rubber and sulphur. But if\r\nlitharge be a constituent, it is found that acetone-extracted rubber will\r\nhardly vulcanise at all. From this, it follows that a rubber giving a low\r\nacetone extract may be found to vulcanise exceptionally slowly in a mixing\r\ncontaining litharge, whereas it shows no such defect when compounded with\r\nsulphur only.[51] Litharge is used to a very large extent, as it has a\r\nbalancing effect in a rubber compound--that is to say, it allows of\r\nappreciable variation in vulcanising conditions, without corresponding\r\nalteration in the state of cure.[52]\r\n\r\n[51] _Journal Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1916, p. 874.\r\n\r\n[52] _Ibid._, 1915, p. 524.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF VARIOUS FACTORS IN RAW RUBBER PREPARATION ON THE \"RATE OF\r\nCURE,\" OR \"RATE OF VULCANISATION.\"--As the capacity of a rubber for\r\nvulcanisation depends on the presence of small quantities of accessory\r\nsubstances in the serum which act as catalysts, the rate of vulcanisation\r\n(or curing) will depend on the nature and quantity of such substances\r\npresent in the rubber. A very small quantity of these substances has a\r\nconsiderable influence on rate of vulcanising, and as the substances are\r\ndifficult to isolate and identify, our knowledge of their formation and\r\nchemical nature is not as definite as is desirable. Substances have been\r\nisolated having the characteristics of \"simpler bases.\" Bodies of this\r\nclass are formed by putrefaction of organic matter, and can be separated in\r\nmuch larger quantity from coagulated latex, which has been allowed to\r\nputrefy before working up than from such which has been worked up without\r\ngiving time for an appreciable amount of putrefaction to take place.\r\nFurther, rubber from putrefied coagulum vulcanised much faster than that\r\nordinarily prepared, so that we are justified in connecting the\r\nputrefaction bases with the rate of vulcanisation. Moreover, it has been\r\nshown that any treatment of the latex or coagulum which inhibits the\r\ndevelopment of putrefactive organisms also prevents the rubber vulcanising\r\nas fast as would otherwise have been the case.[53] Also, the crude bases\r\nisolated from fast vulcanising rubber have the power of increasing the rate\r\nof vulcanisation when added to ordinary slow vulcanising rubber.[54]\r\n\r\n[53] Eaton and Co-workers: See Bulletin No. 27, F.M.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture.\r\n\r\n[54] _Journal Soc. Chem. Ind._, 1917, p. 365.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are one or two facts which are difficult although\r\nnot impossible to fit in with theory. Thus, although the putrefaction bases\r\nare very easily soluble in water and acetone, they cannot be removed by\r\nwashing on the creping rollers, or by acetone extraction. This may be due\r\nto the power of colloidal substances to retain other crystalloidal\r\nsubstances, such as the bases, which, in consequence, cannot be washed out.\r\nA parallel case is the retention of small quantities of water soluble\r\nsubstances in the soil. Also, the theory does not explain why rubber\r\nobtained by evaporation of latex at relatively high temperatures is fast\r\nvulcanising, although the possibility of putrefaction is excluded.\r\n\r\nAs regards practical results, it follows that the rate of vulcanisation (or\r\ncure) of a sample of rubber will depend on the time allowed to elapse\r\nbetween the collection of the latex and treatment till the rubber is dry,\r\nas also on atmospheric conditions. Thus, slow drying will result in an\r\nincreased rate of cure, for it gives an opportunity for putrefactive\r\norganisms to play a part. The results will, however, be influenced by the\r\nextent to which the rubber was washed previous to hanging, and so forth.\r\nSmoking is an antiseptic process and will, therefore, tend to inhibit the\r\naction of micro-organisms and produce a slower vulcanising rubber. On the\r\nother hand, sheet contains more serum than crepe, so that there is more\r\nfood material for growth of micro-organisms. The net result is to give a\r\nrubber (sheet) which usually vulcanises a little faster than crepe.\r\n\r\nAmong other factors controlling the rate of cure, special mention should be\r\nmade of the nature and amount of coagulants. Weak \"organic\" acids, such as\r\nacetic, lactic, tartaric, etc., used in the minimal proportions (1 to 1,200\r\nof standardised latex in the case of acetic acid), give the fastest\r\nvulcanising rubber; \"strong\" mineral acids, such as sulphuric acid, even\r\nwhen used in the minimal proportions (1 to 2,000), yield slower vulcanising\r\nrubber. Acid salts, such as alum, are intermediate in effect. Increased\r\nproportions of coagulant cause a reduction in rate of vulcanising with all\r\ncoagulants, and the effect is least noticeable in crepe rubber,\r\nintermediate in sheet rubber, and most pronounced in \"slab\" rubber\r\n(discussed below).[55]\r\n\r\n[55] Bulletin R.G.A., July, 1919, p. 39; September, 1920, p. 343; November,\r\n1920, p. 433; October, 1921, p. 393; March, 1922, p. 134.\r\n\r\nOTHER TYPES OF PLANTATION RUBBER.--We have up to now confined our attention\r\nto ordinary thin air-dried crepe and smoked sheet, as almost all plantation\r\nrubber is now marketed in one or other of these two forms. There are,\r\nhowever, other types, to which reference has been made. Of these, the most\r\nimportant is the thick blanket crepe, made chiefly in Ceylon by rolling\r\ntogether thin crepe, which has been artificially dried (Colombo drier or\r\nvacuum drier). The heat of the driers causes a surface stickiness, which is\r\ngot rid of by rolling several thin layers together to give one thick one.\r\nThis rubber vulcanises at about the same rate as ordinary thin crepe, for\r\nthe relatively high temperature of drying does not appear to influence the\r\nrate of cure. The rubber is generally softer than air-dried crepe, and is\r\neasily \"let down\" in naphtha; it is, therefore, suitable for some solution\r\nwork. Generally speaking, the properties of blanket crepe do not differ\r\nmaterially from ordinary thin crepe. Another type of rubber seldom met with\r\nis matured slab or crepe, prepared from it. This type of rubber is being\r\nmade in small quantities on one or two estates, who supply direct to the\r\nmanufacturer. The method of preparation has already been described. It is\r\nunsuitable for sale in the open market, as it contains a variable amount of\r\nmoisture, has the various surface defects such as slime, mould, and \"rust,\"\r\nand there is the additional disadvantage that it is not easy to judge of\r\nits cleanliness or freedom from coarse impurities by inspection. If the\r\nslab rubber be creped and air-dried on the spot, the product is of\r\nsatisfactory appearance, except that it is of low colour and may be\r\nstreaked. As the crepe so produced vulcanises almost as fast as the\r\noriginal slab, the crepe embodies all the advantages of a fast curing\r\nrubber with few of the disadvantages of the slab itself. We have made\r\nexperiments from time to time, and found that by a judicious use of sodium\r\nbisulphite it is possible to produce a fast vulcanising crepe rubber\r\nsufficiently even and light in colour to satisfy the Standards Committee.\r\n\r\nA fast curing raw rubber is not necessarily a desirable type for all\r\nmanufacturing purposes. In the vulcanising of large masses of rubber, a\r\nslower rather than a faster vulcanising rubber may be desirable, so as to\r\ngive ample time for the heat to penetrate and spread evenly throughout the\r\nmass. But for many purposes a fast curing rubber enables a larger output to\r\nbe obtained, so that artificial organic accelerators are coming more and\r\nmore into use. The addition of such accelerators might be obviated, if a\r\nsuitable fast curing rubber were available, but it is essential that such\r\nrubber should be uniform. It is just in this respect that slab rubber or\r\ncrepe made therefrom is found to be deficient.[56] The rate of cure depends\r\non the functions of wild bacteria, which are naturally sensitive to changes\r\nof conditions, such as temperature, etc. The coagulated rubber depends on\r\nchance circumstances for infection, and, as a natural result, the activity\r\nof the bacteria and the nature and amounts of active vulcanising agent\r\nproduced will vary and be difficult to control. Consequently, the rate of\r\ncure of slab rubber shows considerably greater variation than ordinary\r\ncrepe or sheet.[57] This, in our opinion, is the main difficulty of\r\nutilising \"slab,\" or crepe prepared from it. Experience in other\r\nindustries, using micro-organisms, has shown that the only method of\r\ncontrol has been to replace the wild growths by cultures of some particular\r\nstrain, as, for instance, in yeasts for brewing. To control the rate of\r\ncure of slab, it might be possible to use a special culture for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[56] Bulletin R.G.A., January, 1920, p. 6; January, 1921, p. 47.\r\n\r\n[57] _Ibid._, January, 1920, p. 68.\r\n\r\nOther less usual methods of preparation, referred to in the earlier part of\r\nthis book, do not call for particular mention, as the properties of the\r\nrubber do not differ much from ordinary sheet or crepe. It is mainly a\r\nmatter of variation in rate of cure.\r\n\r\nThis short account of the vulcanising properties of plantation rubber would\r\nnot be complete without a reference to Fine Hard Para, the premier rubber\r\nof the Amazon. This rubber has come to be regarded as the standard\r\nhigh-grade product with which plantation rubber may be compared, and many\r\nmanufacturers are still of the opinion that it is unsurpassed by any\r\nplantation product. Yet, when subjected to the ordinary vulcanising tests,\r\nwe find that samples of Fine Hard Para give figures very similar to average\r\nplantation rubber; indeed, it is not difficult to find specimens of\r\nplantation rubber which give appreciably higher figures on testing. It is\r\nclaimed, however, that Fine Para is more uniform than plantation rubber,\r\nand can be relied on always to give the same results. Yet tests on a series\r\nof Fine Hard Para specimens gave variations in rate of cure similar to\r\nthose found for plantation. Some figures were published, which tended to\r\nshow that the variation was smaller for Fine Para, but it turned out that\r\neach of the samples taken for examination consisted actually of a number of\r\nslices cut from different balls, so that greater uniformity was not\r\nunexpected.[58] The superiority of Fine Para is, therefore, somewhat of a\r\nmystery. It is probable that some manufacturers prefer to use it because\r\nthey feel safer with it, and know actually how it will behave from long\r\nexperience. In one respect Fine Para is possibly superior to most\r\nplantation rubber--that is, for the preparation of raw rubber solution for\r\nsticking the seams of waterproof garments, and for similar purposes. The\r\nmethod of preparation may well influence the strength of the raw rubber\r\nwhen used for this purpose. Plantation rubber has been prepared in the same\r\nmanner as Brazilian Para, in particular on an estate in Java. The product\r\nresembles Brazilian Para in appearance. Vulcanising tests gave satisfactory\r\nfigures, but, as already stated, this would not serve to show that the\r\nrubber was equal to Brazilian Para from the manufacturer's standpoint.\r\n\r\n[58]
