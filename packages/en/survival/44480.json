The only preface which can be necessary in a publication so\r\ninconsiderable, is to certify its authenticity, by avowing the name and\r\naffixing the responsibility of the author.\r\n\r\nThe following simple history of the narrative will, it is presumed,\r\nbe sufficient to remove all scruples as to its truthfulness and\r\nreality. In the summer of 1844, Captain Adam Yule, of Dundee, committed\r\ninto my hands a large manuscript, containing the substance of the\r\nfollowing pages, with a request that I would use my utmost freedom\r\nwith the materials, and give them to the world in any form that was\r\nmost agreeable to myself. I learned that he had drawn up his account\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, immediately after the occurrences detailed\r\nhad happened, and that he had consigned it on his return to this\r\ncountry, into the hands of a venerable friend, who had retained it\r\nfor two years, without finding the leisure necessary to correct and\r\nprepare it for publication. In the execution of the trust reposed in\r\nme, I considered it proper to reconstruct the narrative out of the\r\nmaterials with which I was furnished; retaining, at the same time,\r\nevery important incident in its place, and in no case suppressing the\r\nutterance of the devout experience of the writer. For the fidelity with\r\nwhich I have adhered to the original facts, I hold myself responsible\r\nalike to Captain Yule and to the Christian public; and I am happy to\r\nacknowledge that I have received, both from himself and from several\r\nof his fellow-survivors in that disastrous voyage, the most pleasing\r\nassurances of the truthfulness of the statements. It is necessary\r\nthat, in such circumstances, I should exonerate Captain Yule from\r\nall responsibility as to the _manner_ in which these facts are now\r\nsubmitted to the public,--as I must be content, undividedly, to bear\r\nwhatever censure criticism may condescend to offer on the _literature_\r\nof this publication.\r\n\r\nThe Editor dismisses his humble labours with satisfaction, that he\r\nhas been permitted to aid in rearing this simple tribute on behalf of\r\na class of men who must always hold a warm place in his interest and\r\naffections; and whose perilous sacrifices of personal comfort and of\r\nreligious opportunities, in their calling, entitle them to the cordial\r\nsympathy of all Christians. He accompanies the brief narrative with his\r\nprayers, that it may be the instrument of spiritual benefit to many\r\nsouls, and may fulfil the only design in its publication, in promoting\r\npiety among sailors, and confirming the promise of God, \"that He is\r\nnigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n                                                       JAMES R.

His life has been prolonged\r\nby divine mercy through almost every scene of sea-faring experience,\r\nand it has been preserved by scarcely less than miracle, amidst perils\r\nto which not many sailors have been exposed. The following story, in\r\nall its facts and experience, is properly his own; and, therefore,\r\nthroughout he is preserved as the speaker. Only in the matter of\r\nconstruction and expression, another party must be held responsible,\r\ninto whose hands the full materials were committed to give them form.\r\nIt was the devout desire of the original party not to forget Jehovah's\r\nbenefits; _having_, like the Psalmist (Psalm lxvi. 12,) \"gone through\r\nfire and through water,\" he felt solicitous to say with the same holy\r\nminstrel, (verse 16,) \"Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will\r\ntell you what he hath done for my soul.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1840, I accepted the command of the Australia,\r\nof Dundee, bound for Sydney, New South Wales. On the 2d October,\r\nour vessel set sail from Leith, having on board a general cargo of\r\nmerchandize. Our ship's company consisted of twenty-eight persons,\r\nbeing thirteen of a crew, and fifteen passengers. My heart was buoyant\r\nwith hope and pleasing anticipations as I bade my family farewell,\r\nand weighed anchor for my destination. Everything gave promise of\r\na propitious voyage. Our vessel was new and well found in every\r\nnecessary, the crew were able, and well selected, and the passengers\r\nwere agreeable, all being full of hope and fearless of evil. Indeed,\r\nif we could have anticipated results, my company were most unlikely\r\nand ill selected for enduring the hardships that awaited us; three of\r\nthe crew being but apprentice lads, and of the passengers, five being\r\nfemales, besides two boys and a girl of very tender years. But who has\r\nnot seen, that while the helpless are sometimes the first to be visited\r\nby the storm, they frequently are found, also, to survive its fury;\r\nwhen the strong, who were the most likely to brave its blast, are\r\nborne down and destroyed before it? \"I returned and saw under the sun,\r\nthat the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong--for\r\nman also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil\r\nnet, so are the sons of men snared, when it falleth suddenly upon them.\"\r\n\r\nThe commencement of our voyage was sufficiently prosperous. We rounded\r\nCape Wrath by an easy progress, and were in the latitude of Madeira in\r\nseven days from Cape Clear. Nothing remarkable occurred till after our\r\ndeparture from Rio de Janeiro, where we touched for a few days in the\r\nbeginning of December. We were then baffled with boisterous weather\r\nand contrary winds, till the 27th of that month, when the wind became\r\nfair, and the weather improved. On the evening of the 29th, December,\r\nwe had all sails set, with a strong fair wind, and a heavy sea. At\r\nthis time, by recent observations, I found that we must have been in\r\nlatitude 35° 51´ south, and longitude 8° 8´ east of Greenwich, or, in\r\nround numbers, about 600 miles from the nearest land, which was the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Our passengers had as usual walked the deck after\r\ntea, until about eight o'clock, when, feeling it cold, they had gone\r\nbelow. In less than half an hour, I followed them to the after-cabin,\r\nhaving given the chief mate his orders for the night. We were all in\r\nexcellent spirits, and speculating how soon, and how safely we should\r\nreach our destination with so good a wind. Alas! how little did we\r\nknow the horrors that awaited us: destruction even then had begun its\r\nfrightful work, and was silently, but too surely consuming our solitary\r\nand sea-girded habitation. Soon after entering the cabin, I was\r\naffected with a sense of something burning; supposing that the ladies\r\nmight have set something in their bed-rooms on fire, I ran forward\r\nin the dark to their cabins, but found everything safe. The sense of\r\nburning, however, became more strong and decided. I therefore snatched\r\na light, and found, to my dismay, that smoke was issuing from the fore\r\nbulk-head on the starboard side of the mainmast. It was but the work\r\nof an instant to clear away the goods with which that untenanted berth\r\nhad been filled, if possible to reach the seat of the fire. My brother\r\nWilliam, and four or five seamen withstood resolutely the suffocating\r\nsmoke that surrounded them in this labour, while others stood arranged\r\nand ready with buckets full of water, to dash upon the first appearance\r\nof fire. But what was our horror to find, on emptying the berth, that\r\nthe evil lay deeper, and was every moment on the increase; in short,\r\nthat the _ship's hold was on fire_! This was too soon apparent, for,\r\non removing a plank from the bulk-head, we saw the whole interior\r\nof the vessel like the womb of a volcano, and the entire cargo of\r\ncoals and combustible goods in a blaze. It was impossible, from the\r\nsuperincumbent and intervening goods, to pour in water in sufficient\r\nquantity to extinguish so extensive a conflagration; this I perceived\r\nat first glance, and therefore at once drove in the board to confine\r\nthe flames, feeling, in the agony of despair, that _the ship was\r\nirrecoverably to be consumed_.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful moment to every one of us. To die on so sudden\r\nsummoning, and to be summoned to _such a death_, were sufficient to\r\nappal the stoutest heart. What were we to do?--beneath us was a burning\r\nbier, and all beyond was a black and angry abyss. We could not abide\r\nwhere we were, and to go forth scarcely promised a better fate, for no\r\nlittle boat could live long in such a sea. I saw in the countenances\r\nof the haggard beings around me, that they were fully alive to either\r\nfate. Some, frantic with terror, sent forth cries, which found no\r\necho from our shoreless and surrounding solitude; others clung around\r\nme, tormenting me with questions which I could not answer; while the\r\nremainder stood silent and trembling, as if the presence of death had\r\nsmitten them dumb. It was easy to discern their emotions in their\r\ndemeanour--but why should I dilate on others' feelings, when I can but\r\nfaintly recall my own? I have a confused recollection of a tumultuous\r\nthrong of momentous interests rushing upon me with an overpowering\r\nrapidity, and of a certain effort of self-possession seeking to stem,\r\nwhile it received the tide. Visions of danger--of self-protection--of\r\ndeath, mingled with thoughts of duty--of home--of a probably widowed\r\nwife and fatherless family--all flashed wildly through my brain. I\r\nfelt that I stood in immediate contact with death, and the solemnities\r\nof a judgment to come rose in array before me. It is not for me to\r\nreveal the secrecies of such a situation; but I can only say as one who\r\nhas been \"in deaths oft,\" and with all the solemnities of that hour\r\nbefore me, that I know but one confidence that has proved unfailing and\r\ninfallible in such a crisis, and that is, _a personal interest in the\r\nLord Jesus Christ, and an implicit reliance on his perfect work_.\r\n\r\nAs I looked around upon the shivering group that had enclosed me,\r\nI became filled with one solemn conviction,--it was my official\r\nresponsibility; and I was fired with one desperate effort--the\r\neffort of rescue. Without a moment's delay, therefore, the plan of\r\narrangements was fixed, and the orders were given. The mate was\r\ninstructed to ease sail, and heave the ship to, in order to draw the\r\nfire forward, and clear the after-part of the ship from smoke, so as to\r\nallow us to labour with efficiency. A hole was then cut in the deck,\r\nabove the strongest seat of the fire, and an uninterrupted stream of\r\nwater poured down through the opening; but the rapid increase of smoke\r\nand flame soon convinced us that all idea of subduing the fire, and\r\nsaving the ship, was impracticable. We then covered the deck with the\r\nloose sails, to smother, as far as possible, the smoke and flame; for\r\nby this time the deck-plank was blistering beneath our feet, and it\r\nwas impossible to breathe amidships. Our next efforts were directed to\r\nlaunching the long-boat, which, as usual, was secured on deck. This\r\nproved to be a work of great difficulty, and occasioned considerable\r\ndelay, not unmixed with danger. The boat had been converted into a\r\nstall for two live bulls, and in attempting to get them over the side,\r\none of them, in the confusion, unfortunately got out of the slings, and\r\nran frantic along the deck. This accident, as may be supposed, greatly\r\nincreased the general consternation, and much invaluable time was lost\r\nere the ferocious animal could be secured and despatched; so that when\r\nthe tackles were hooked on to the boat, it was impossible to breathe in\r\nthat part of the ship. The men could only take a hasty pull and then\r\nrush aft to breathe; and it was only after repeated efforts, and great\r\nperseverance, that we got the bow of the long-boat sufficiently high\r\nfor launching. We then manned the after-tackle, but, unfortunately, it\r\nunhooked aloft, and it required enormous exertions to get it replaced;\r\nhowever, by fastening some guys round the rigging, and through the\r\nblessing of God on our efforts, we at length got the boat launched,\r\nand two good hands into her. To pass her aft, and preserve her from\r\nswamping, were matters of great labour; for the roll of the sea was\r\nso heavy, and the smoke was so dense over the lee-side, that we could\r\nnot see what we were doing. While these things were going on, I had\r\nordered the steward to prepare some bread, and small stores, to put\r\ninto the boat; and I now went down to see what progress he had made\r\nfor our supply, leaving the mate on deck to roll some water casks aft,\r\nand after slinging them well, to drop them over the quarter to the\r\nlong-boat. Every moment, by this time, was invaluable; for the flames\r\nhad now made their appearance up the fore-hatch, and very soon caught\r\nthe rigging and sails. I can never sufficiently commend the energy of\r\nthe mate, and the steadiness and good behaviour of the men during these\r\nexertions. There was no swearing, no inclination to fly to spirits;\r\nevery man was obedient to orders, and anxious to do his utmost. Even\r\nthe passengers revealed the same excellent spirit; I heard no screams\r\nfrom the females, and even the children ceased to cry. All seemed to\r\nfeel that every effort was making for their safety, and they silently\r\nacquiesced in the arrangements.\r\n\r\nOur preparations were soon made. Two small bags of bread, two hams,\r\ntwo cheeses, two or three canisters of preserved meat, and a few\r\nbottles of wine, with a sextant, some charts, an almanac, my Bible and\r\nPsalm-Book, and some flannel shirts and blankets, &c., were all that\r\nwe could secure amid the suffocating smoke. These were immediately\r\ncarried on deck, and secured in the skiff, which still hung in the\r\nstern-davits. The mate, in the meantime, had rolled two casks of\r\nrain-water aft, which was all that he could obtain. To secure their\r\nsafe transmission to the long-boat in such a sea, was no easy matter.\r\nI therefore confided to the mate to lift them into the boat, and he\r\nleft the ship for this purpose. The first cask was well directed, but\r\nin lifting it over the gunwale of the boat, it fell upon the mate and\r\nanother seaman, who were dreadfully bruised; it was a marvel, indeed,\r\nthat they were not killed. In consequence of their being disabled,\r\nthe second cask got out of the slings, and we lost it. This was a very\r\nserious matter, but it was irreparable, as the whole front part of the\r\nship was now on fire, and quite impassable for any purpose. Finding\r\nthat I could make no further provision for the people, I put the ladies\r\nand three children in the skiff, with two seamen, who were ordered to\r\ncut the faulds, so soon as she touched the water, while we lowered\r\nthem from the davits. This was done in safety, which was a special\r\nmercy, as the boat was greatly overloaded; having, besides the stores,\r\nand the above company, two of the passengers, who, unknown to me, had\r\nconcealed themselves under the thafts. There were now left on board\r\nthe ship five or six persons, together with myself. These immediately\r\nlaunched the small boat, which hung on the main-deck, and got safely\r\ninto it, so that, for a little season, I stood the last living thing\r\namid the burning mass. My position was alike novel and awful; two\r\nhorrid deaths were before me--one on either hand--and I stood but upon\r\na point between them. At that moment the flame was playing fearfully\r\nover all the rigging; the topping-lifts had been burnt through, and the\r\ntrysail-boom came swinging down on the taffrail; the trysail itself was\r\non fire as high up as the third reef, and the mainmast every moment was\r\nexpected to fall above me. With a heavy heart I felt that I must quit\r\nfor ever the ship and property, of which I could no longer retain the\r\ncharge. Another and a still more sacred trust was beneath me; and as\r\nI looked down upon the twenty-seven hapless beings, ghastly amid the\r\nglare of the burning ship, and tossed above the billows that soon might\r\nbe our mutual tomb, I felt--oh, how I felt--that the charge of such\r\nbeings was _not mine_. Calmly as my momentary solitude would permit,\r\nI lifted my soul to Him who \"rules the raging of the sea,\" and cast\r\nmyself and company into his everlasting arms. If ever fervent prayer\r\nwas productive of immediate peace, my heart felt it at that moment;\r\nfor the words of God thrilled through me at the instant, as if his\r\nown finger had inscribed them upon my bosom,--\"Call upon me in the\r\nday of trouble, I will deliver thee.\" I was recalled, however, from\r\nmy reverie by the mate imploring me to come into the boat, and as I\r\ncould do no more, I obeyed the summons; so, sliding down the tackles,\r\nI got safely into the boat, among my wretched companions. At that\r\ninstant the mainmast fell with a tremendous crash over the side, and\r\nthe flames shot up with frightful fury from the cabin-skylight, as if\r\nto intimate that the work of destruction was nearly completed, and that\r\nour ill-fated vessel was no longer fit to be a refuge for living beings.\r\n\r\n\"One woe was past;\" and although we knew well that others were awaiting\r\nus, it was still an act of marvellous mercy that so many persons had\r\n\"come out of the midst of the fire\" with \"not a hair of any of our\r\nheads singed.\" It is needless to speculate as to the cause of our\r\ndisaster; but, as it undoubtedly began in the lower hold among the\r\ncoals, it was most probably produced by spontaneous combustion. When\r\nthe last person left the ship, it must have been about eleven o'clock,\r\nso that in less than three hours we had been cast forth from security\r\nand comfort, amidst cold, and nakedness, and watching, to face dangers\r\nand deaths in their most dismal aspect. It was my design to have\r\nremained by the wreck till dawn, in the hope--a hope, alas, that was\r\nnot to be realized--that some friendly ship might be attracted by the\r\nburning to our rescue. But the boats were in danger of being stove, it\r\nbeing impossible at all times to prevent their chafing; and, ere long,\r\nthe rope by which we were made fast to the wreck became burnt through,\r\nso that we were compelled to part even from the desolate companionship\r\nof the burning vessel, and were cast adrift at midnight, upon the black\r\nand boundless solitude of ocean. Still clinging to the hope of rescue,\r\nI sought to keep the boats as close to the wreck as possible, and made\r\nthe best distribution of our company that I could. I took charge of the\r\nlong-boat with other sixteen souls in it; seven were in the skiff, and\r\nfour in the small-boat, and there we drifted till morning came.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe the grandeur and horrors of that\r\nnight. Let fancy paint, if it may, so many hapless beings huddled\r\ntogether unpreparedly, exposed without shelter to the cold night sky,\r\nand expecting every moment to be swallowed up. Ocean was ever fretting,\r\nand curveting, and plunging beneath us, as if it had wrathfully\r\nresolved to cast us from its \"crested mane.\" The sky all above and\r\naround was one scene of blackness, unbroken by one opening in its\r\ncloud, and unblest by the radiance of one solitary star. Behind the\r\nboats--in the region whither we were drifting, every thing was dark\r\nas the grave. Light indeed attended us throughout that lone midnight,\r\nbut it was the glare of destruction, which, as it contended with the\r\nsurrounding darkness, only increased its horror. The flames long played\r\nin magnificent grandeur, kindling the dark sky above, and reflecting\r\ntheir lurid gleam from the ridge of every billow, as if they mocked\r\nour misery by their majestic triumph. And ever and anon came some\r\nterrific explosion--probably of the ship's spirits--which struck like a\r\ndeath-knell upon our hearts, proclaiming that the work of ruin was well\r\nnigh accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of extremity, one only hope remained to us--one last\r\ngrand anchor-hold to preserve us from despair. We remembered Him \"who\r\nmaketh darkness his secret place, his pavilion round about him dark\r\nwaters, and thick clouds of the skies;\" We thought of Him as \"the\r\nconfidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off\r\nupon the sea, who stilleth the noise of the sea, and the noise of their\r\nwaves.\" And there, \"out of the depths we cried unto Him.\" Mingling\r\nwith the voice of the wind and waters, and rising above their murmurs,\r\nthe sound of our praise and supplications ascended on the midnight\r\nair, and was heard before the throne. It was a sacred relief to our\r\nheavy hearts to feel that the eye of God still watched over us in our\r\nmisery, and that his ear was open to our cry: and although we knew not\r\nthe dark path that lay before us, yet we sought it with His words on\r\nour lips,--\"The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted\r\nup their voice; the floods lift up their waves. THE LORD ON HIGH IS\r\nMIGHTIER THAN THE NOISE OF MANY WATERS, YEA THAN THE MIGHTY WAVES OF\r\nTHE SEA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFERINGS IN THE BOATS.\r\n\r\n    \"They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths;\r\n    their soul is melted because of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Joy cometh in the morning;\" but it was not so with our forlorn\r\ncompany. Daylight of the 30th December dawned only to reveal our\r\nmutual wretchedness, and to aggravate our distress. Our hapless vessel\r\nvanished in the distance as daylight appeared, and our hearts fainted\r\nto discover that no friendly sail was visible within the range of the\r\nhorizon, for our rescue. Left alone in that vast solitude of sea and\r\nsky, it only now remained for us to seek our safety by making for\r\nthe nearest land, or to die in the endeavour. We were but \"in the\r\nbeginning of sorrows,\" and our first business was to commit ourselves\r\nto God. Gathering our boats as closely as possible together, we\r\njoined in singing the 38th Psalm, 1-5th verses, and by prayer \"poured\r\nout our complaint before God, and showed before him our trouble.\"\r\nBeing comforted by this exercise, we immediately thereafter commenced\r\nactive preparations for our melancholy voyage. Our first object was\r\nto rig a mast and sail in each boat. We had only oars to form our\r\nmasts, and a top-gallant studding sail and royal fore sails. With some\r\nsmall lines, shrouds and stays were made; and by six o'clock in the\r\nmorning all the three boats were under sail for our destination. I then\r\ncommenced to overhaul our stock of supplies, and found that we had two\r\nsmall cheeses, two hams, only about twenty-four gallons of water, and\r\nseventy or eighty pounds of bread, which was damaged by salt water,\r\nwith a half gallon of rum, a half gallon of brandy, and a few bottles\r\nof wine. This supply was by no means adequate to sustain life among\r\nsuch a company for many days. I therefore called the boats together,\r\nand told the people that we could not expect to make the land in less\r\nthan ten or twelve days, and it might take a day or two more; that\r\nour stock of water and provisions was far short, and that therefore\r\nwe must come at once on short allowance. I am happy to say that all\r\nacquiesced with the proposition, and, indeed, showed throughout the\r\nhappiest spirit of subordination and harmony. Our small allowance was\r\nthen distributed, which gave a little bread, which was repeated in the\r\nevening, and _only three table spoonfuls of water to each per day_. At\r\nnoon I got an observation for the latitude, and found it 35 deg. 37\r\nsec. south, and longitude 9 deg. 15 sec. east of Greenwich. We again\r\nengaged in the worship of God, and sought to keep the boats in close\r\ncompany. But as day declined the weather looked wild; and the men in\r\nthe small boat, being afraid of her capsizing during the night, I\r\nhad to divide her company between the long-boat and skiff, and cast\r\nher adrift. Nine persons were thus in the skiff, and nineteen in the\r\nlongboat, which sank us very deep in the water, and uncomfortably\r\novercrowded us. The long-boat was particularly uncomfortable, being\r\nlumbered with our small stock of provisions; and, having been used as\r\na stall for cattle, we were not only soaked with seawater, but smeared\r\nwith filth. Our distressing situation may easily be supposed, with a\r\npromiscuous company of ladies and children crowded together without the\r\nmeans of separation, and exposed night and day to the action of all\r\nthe rudest elements. We however washed our boat, which served somewhat\r\nto improve our condition. At the close of day we again sang praise to\r\nGod, and implored his protection and blessing. The regular performance\r\nof this duty was a great comfort to us in our misery, and I was well\r\nassisted in its discharge by Mr. Wallace the mate, my brother William,\r\nand nephew John, as well as by some of the passengers, all of whom\r\noccasionally conducted the devotions. We made it our endeavour to unite\r\nboth boats in one exercise of daily praise and prayer, and when this\r\nwas impracticable, service was separately conducted in the skiff by\r\nGeorge Davidson and Thomas Souter, seamen. In no case, to the best of\r\nmy knowledge, was this duty omitted from being performed three times a\r\nday, so that we could say, with the Psalmist, \"Evening, and morning,\r\nand at noon, we pray and cry aloud, and he shall hear our voice.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind blew freshly from the south, and the sea\r\nwas so heavy, that I was obliged to deviate to the north of my course\r\na little, in the hope of regaining my leeway by a future and more\r\nfavourable wind and sea. But although it would have been hard work\r\nto fetch the Cape of Good Hope even with a fairer wind, we could not\r\nhelp ourselves, as our little boats could not breast the billows, and\r\nyet we hauled them as close to the wind as we dared. The moon shone\r\non us during a part of that night, and enabled us to keep the boats\r\ntogether; but when she set, we were greatly distressed by the danger of\r\nseparating. At length day light came to the relief of our sleepless\r\nand anxious watching, but only to the increase of our other sorrows.\r\nThis day the people pleaded with tears for an increase to the allowance\r\nof water, and my soul yearned for the petitioners; but although I felt\r\nthe strength of their craving in my own fevered frame, I dared not\r\naccede to their request. I knew that our distance from land rendered it\r\ncertain destruction for us to increase our expenditure, unless, indeed,\r\nsome friendly bark should cross our path, which we could not certify,\r\nand which certainly never occurred. I therefore earnestly exhorted\r\nthem to make the best use of the small quantity allowed, by dividing\r\nit into three daily distributions. This was done in the long-boat,\r\nand we felt the benefit of it, in the more frequent moistening of our\r\npalate, and the easier mastication of our bread. At noon I obtained\r\nan observation, and found the latitude 34 deg. 49 min. south, and\r\ncalculated our longitude at 11 deg. 40 min. east. A little wine was\r\ndistributed this day along with the usual allowance of water, which\r\nwas greedily swallowed. Towards evening another earnest appeal came\r\nfrom the people in the skiff for an additional allowance of water,\r\nwhich I was compelled to refuse. Contrary to my injunctions, they had\r\nswallowed their allowance at one draught, and were therefore in agony\r\ntill the time for next day's supply. I learned, also, that some of them\r\nhad begun to drink salt water, which I sought in vain to prevent. I\r\ntold them that if they persisted they would become delirious, which,\r\nalas! was soon too painfully realized.\r\n\r\nThe wind lulled a little about midnight, but the darkness greatly\r\ndistressed us, and about four o'clock we lost sight of the skiff.\r\nWe immediately lowered our sail, and with difficulty got a light in\r\nthe lantern, awaiting the result with intense anxiety. For half an\r\nhour this distressing suspense continued, when, to our great relief,\r\nthe boat re-appeared. Night ere long again departed, but with each\r\nreturning day we found the sufferings of our company on the increase;\r\ncold and thirst were making shocking inroads among us. Up to this\r\ntime we had never been able to stretch our stiffened limbs, and we\r\nhad all the while been thoroughly drenched by the constant action of\r\nthe sea. This day, however, being more favourable, we got our clothes\r\npartially dried, and managed to erect a temporary bulwark of blankets\r\non the weather-side, which afforded some additional shelter from\r\nthe elements. This enabled us to perform our worship \"with a little\r\nreviving,\" and we partook of our scanty allowance with increasing\r\nappetite. My observation for this day was latitude 34 deg. 30 min.\r\nsouth, and longitude 12 deg. 49 min. east. Towards evening the wind\r\nand sea increased from the south-west, and as I could not make my\r\ncourse good, I allowed the boats to run, so as to make all the easting\r\npossible. At midnight the moon went down, and as the sea ran very high,\r\nwe had difficulty to preserve the boats in company during the darkness.\r\nOur candles were scanty, so that we could not burn constant light,\r\nand we longed exceedingly for the coming of day. By this time our\r\ndistresses were very grievous; the midnight sea had thoroughly soaked\r\nevery one of us, and several of our people gave decisive symptoms\r\nof insanity, especially two of the passengers in the skiff, who had\r\npersisted in drinking the salt water. In the morning the weather became\r\nmore moderate; at noon we were in latitude 34 deg. 34 min. south, and\r\nlongitude 14 deg. 37 min. east, so that I concluded, if the weather\r\nshould keep favourable, that in three days' sail we might make the\r\nland. The wretched condition of our company towards evening constrained\r\nme to administer a little wine, and an additional half of a wine\r\nglassful of water to each; I exhorted them to use it sparingly, as I\r\ndreaded a stormy night; but the people in the skiff consumed it on the\r\ninstant. Milder weather succeeded in the morning, which enabled us to\r\ndry our clothes. In the afternoon we rigged a temporary jib, with a\r\nsheet for a studding-sail, and the crew of the skiff did the same. I\r\ntried for an observation, and found the latitude 34 deg. 12 min, but\r\nmy chronometer by this time was nearly useless for the calculation of\r\nlongitude, and I guessed it to be 15 deg. 47 min. east. The cry for\r\nwater at this time became heart-rending, especially from the children\r\nin the skiff; their piercing screams went to my inmost soul, and yet\r\nI durst not be subdued by them; therefore, with a feigned sternness,\r\nwhich my heart disallowed, I was compelled to order the skiff to shear\r\noff, so that I might at least be released from listening to their\r\nanguish, which I could neither bear nor brave.\r\n\r\nAgain evening and morning came, and still as our course lengthened\r\nour woes increased. The night and morning were intensely cold, and\r\na hollow sea again had drenched us to the skin. The people seemed\r\nto have reached a state of utter exhaustion, not unmingled with the\r\nindifference of despair. They appeared to have lost all relish for\r\nfood, and water was the only cry; several of them had persisted in\r\ntaking salt water, which it was impossible to prevent, as there were\r\nbut eight or nine inches of free side from the sea, so that they put\r\nout their hand through the night and took it. The consequence was,\r\nthat two in our boat, and the same number in the skiff, were quite\r\ndelirious, while several others in both boats gave symptoms of the same\r\ndistressing state. The ladies throughout behaved with magnanimity, and\r\neven the endurance of the children was admirable. The best arrangements\r\nwere indeed made for them which we could command. We appropriated the\r\nstern sheets to the ladies, as the most comfortable; and for their\r\naccommodation I had to sit upon the gunwale, while steering the boat.\r\nThis post was only filled by the mate and myself, as there was no other\r\nto whom I could confide it; but he, being very unwell, from having been\r\ncrushed by the water-cask, the heaviest share of the duty devolved upon\r\nme. The skiff was managed by Thomas Souter and George Davidson, whose\r\nexcellent seamanship was beyond all praise. The people seemed to be so\r\ndepressed and inclined to sleep, that in the evening I mixed a little\r\nrum with their allowance of water, which partially revived them. The\r\nnight was setting in very gloomily, and as our evening song mingled\r\nwith the rising tempest, I am sure that our hearts sympathized with its\r\nplea. It was Psalm vi.\r\n\r\n    Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;\r\n    Nor in thy hot rage chasten me, &c.\r\n\r\nOur chapter this evening was Acts xxvii., and we prayed that the God\r\nwho stood by Paul, in his perils and shipwreck, would preserve the\r\nlives of all who sailed with us. The night was very dark and stormy,\r\nwith a heavy sea; every wave was broken on the top, and we were nearly\r\nsmothered by the spray. It required all our skill to keep the sea from\r\nbreaking on board of us. I gave orders to the men to stand ready with\r\nour three buckets, in case, amid the darkness, any wave should make\r\na breach on us. At length, about midnight, one frightful billow rose\r\nclose to the boat, and broke right over us. A slight scream rose from\r\nour company at the instant, and I thought our fate was sealed, as the\r\nboat was nearly filled with water, and staggered under the stroke, as\r\nif settling in the trough of the sea. I, however, got her right before\r\nthe wind, and during a short _smooth_ which providentially succeeded,\r\nshe was bailed with all despatch, and righted. The skiff had been in no\r\nbetter condition, and nothing but the most masterly seamanship could\r\nhave preserved her afloat. Frequently we lost sight of each other\r\nduring the darkness, and our matches being wet, we could no longer hold\r\nout a signal-light as formerly. \"By the good hand of our God upon us,\"\r\nhowever, we were mutually preserved, and kept together during that\r\ndismal night.\r\n\r\nA frowning morning succeeded, and found our companions worse than\r\never. I immediately served a small allowance, which revived us all;\r\nindeed I was at this time myself greatly exhausted, having kept the\r\nhelm without stirring for thirty-six hours, on account of the illness\r\nof the mate. My sextant having been spoiled by the loss of its top, I\r\nwas now no longer able to keep our reckoning, except by guess. I was\r\nin hopes that the gale would subside at noon, and permit us to take a\r\nmore southerly course, so as to fetch the Cape, but I was unhappily\r\ndisappointed. The storm only increased in severity, and the sea broke\r\naround us with redoubled fury, driving in the temporary bulwarks, which\r\nwe had re-erected after the night's disaster. I calculated that at this\r\ntime we were about seventy miles from land, but the brackish colour of\r\nthe water led me to suppose that we might be nearer, and, being afraid\r\nto make the coast in the night, I resolved to stand to the north till\r\nmidnight, it being impossible to ride the boats by bridle or otherwise\r\nin such a sea. To this all parties gave consent, and I issued orders\r\naccordingly. I confess that I had almost no hope of seeing morning, and\r\ntherefore told the skiff's crew that if anything happened to us through\r\nthe night, they must stand in for the land, and do the best they could.\r\nMy gloomy forebodings were shared by all, except those--to the number\r\nof six or seven--who were by this time insensible to everything around\r\nthem. After partaking of our allowance with thanksgiving, we committed\r\nourselves to the Lord of life and death, and took leave of each other\r\nwithout the hope of meeting again in this world. In the early part of\r\nthe night our little boats behaved admirably in their conflict with the\r\ntremendous sea, and at eleven o'clock we shifted our small sail, and\r\nstood directly in for the land. The skiff followed, but at midnight\r\nthe wind and waves increased in fury, and a tremendous billow broke\r\nclose astern of us, which seemed to swallow up our dear companions. We\r\nstrained our aching vision to catch the re-appearance of their little\r\nmast, but in vain; with trembling anxiety we then lowered down our\r\nsail, and, after great difficulty, got a light in the lantern, but it\r\nwas soon extinguished, and, after long and anxious waiting, no trace\r\nof the skiff was visible, and we gave them up as lost, believing \"that\r\nthe deep had covered them.\" The sea was breaking so heavily over the\r\nstern, while there was no _way_ on our boat, that we were in danger of\r\nfoundering, so that we were compelled, with deep distress, again to\r\nmake sail, and pursue our course. Life was now faint within me, and I\r\nfelt as if \"the bitterness of death was past.\" A cold shiver had seized\r\nmy frame, and I was inclined to resign all further effort. By the\r\nadministration of a tea-spoonful of wine, however, I rallied a little,\r\nand maintained my post at the helm throughout the night.\r\n\r\nMorning at length broke, but there was no appearance of our companions,\r\nand all hope of their restoration departed. Our morning meal was\r\nconsumed in melancholy silence, and our \"grief was heavier than our\r\ngroaning\" in our morning prayers. Four persons in our boat were\r\nin extreme exhaustion, and one of them--a passenger--named George\r\nPeat, was evidently in a dying state. The weather looked more mild,\r\nand I sought to rally their spirits: with three of them I partially\r\nsucceeded, but Peat took no notice of anything, save to suck greedily\r\nhis allowance of water. In the forenoon the sun broke through the\r\nclouds, and shed an agreeable warmth to which we had long been\r\nstrangers, so that we took off our wet clothes, and hung them up to\r\ndry. The hope of seeing land revived the love of life within us, and,\r\nwith the former exceptions, our company, in spite of the absence of our\r\nother boat, were in better spirits. At eleven o'clock A.M.\r\nthe mate relieved me from the helm, and all were intent in looking out\r\nfor the land. In this we were disappointed; but the mate thought he\r\ndescried something ahead like a mast or a sail. All eyes were turned\r\nin the direction with eagerness, but for a considerable time we could\r\nsee nothing. At last another person saw something on the top of a heavy\r\nwave, and, as we drew nearer, a mast without a sail became distinctly\r\nvisible. Could it be our brethren? was anxiously inquired by every\r\none; and indeed it was. Poor fellows! they had tasted nothing for more\r\nthan twenty-four hours. At the time when they disappeared they were\r\noverwhelmed in the belly of a tremendous broken sea, and their boat\r\nwas nearly filled. Their little mast was carried away, and one of them\r\nwas washed overboard, but catching hold of the boat, they had hauled\r\nhim in again. By extraordinary exertions they then bailed their boat,\r\ngot their mast replaced, and, pursuing our course, in their anxiety to\r\novertake us, had actually passed us before daylight. How we ever met\r\nagain was a mystery to all; but \"it was the Lord's doing, and it was\r\nmarvelous in our eyes.\" I shall not attempt to describe the scene of\r\nour remarkable greeting. It was not joyous, for alas, we had now become\r\nstrangers to every emotion of gladness; but we grasped each other's\r\nhands, and our full hearts found vent in silent tears. Our souls had\r\nbecome knit together in the fellowship of suffering, and in the midst\r\nof deaths, we celebrated their restoration as a deliverance from the\r\ngrave. Of course they received immediate refreshment and a little wine\r\nwas distributed to the whole company on the occasion. Our noontide\r\nworship, which was mutually conducted, arose from overflowing hearts;\r\nand although our common woes were nothing abated, we caught something\r\nof the spirit of our hymn while we sung,\r\n\r\n    Let troubles rise, and terrors frown,\r\n      And days of darkness fall,\r\n    Through Him all dangers we'll defy,\r\n      And more than conquer all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE FORLORN LANDING.\r\n\r\n    \"They are at their wit's end. Then they cry unto the Lord in\r\n    their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He\r\n    maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.\r\n    Then are they glad because they be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo soon as our heartfelt congratulations had blended and been breathed\r\nout in prayer, hope became faintly rekindled in each yet conscious\r\nbosom of our distressed company; and with all our lingering energies\r\nof life, we made for the yet invisible shore. \"The wrath of God lay\r\nhard upon us,\" and, for so many days \"we had been afflicted with all\r\nhis waves,\" that we felt as if all safety consisted only in escape from\r\nocean's \"deeps.\" And yet I was not without apprehension, that\r\nwhat we so fondly anticipated as the occasion of deliverance, might\r\nprove the fatal scene of our doom. The imminent danger of approaching\r\na comparatively unknown coast, especially amid the heavy roll of Cape\r\nseas, and in such small boats as ours, demanded the exercise of every\r\npossible precaution, and suggested forebodings of no very pleasing\r\nissue. By my calculations we had been driven to the north of St. Helena\r\nBay, which, by its bend, gave us forty miles more of sea to traverse\r\nthan if we had been able to keep a more southerly course. On consulting\r\na small fragment of chart--which one of the ladies had preserved for\r\nus, from the action of the sea, in her bosom,--I found, to our great\r\nrelief, that the coast for which we were making was free of any outside\r\nshoals, and appeared favourable for our landing. We therefore made\r\nall speed to reach the shore if possible before nightfall; in this,\r\nhowever, we were disappointed; and a dense fog ahead hid the object\r\nof our solicitude from view, until night descended, and shrouded the\r\nsurrounding landscape in darkness. The weather being moderate I\r\nresolved to prosecute our course throughout the night, and endeavour to\r\neffect our landing at daylight. The evening proved intensely cold, and\r\nwe endured more acute suffering from the wind and spray, during those\r\nhours of darkness, than we had ever done before. This was probably\r\ncaused by our preserving a more southerly course, and keeping the sheet\r\nhauled aft, which exposed us to the action of the sea, and sent the\r\nwind right down on us from the sail. Ere morning came a cold shiver had\r\nconsequently seized every frame, and several persons in both boats were\r\nquite unable to stir.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock the skiff hailed us, and communicated the melancholy\r\ntidings that the lad John Chisholm was dead. This was the first breach\r\nmade among us, and it fell among our wasting company like a forerunner\r\nof our own fate. We were all closely \"round the grave's devouring\r\nmouth,\" and now that it had found its first victim, we felt assured\r\nthat others would follow. George Peat, in our boat, was only in life,\r\nand several persons in both boats were visibly sinking fast into the\r\nsame unconscious state. I felt this visitation bitterly, as I was in\r\nfull hope of reaching land in a few hours, and was sustained--by the\r\nsignal mercy hitherto enjoyed--in the pleasing expectation that \"God\r\nwould have given us the lives of all who sailed with us.\" But \"He who\r\ndoeth according to his will\" had deemed it otherwise, and our hearts\r\nsmote us to think that we had been preserved amid many perils, possibly\r\nonly to perish on the threshold of deliverance.\r\n\r\nVisions of land floated before our aching and anxious gaze throughout\r\nthat weary night, and often we supposed that we could detect the dim\r\noutline of the headlands between the sea and sky. Still we trembled in\r\nuncertainty until morning came; but when the sun arose, it looked down\r\nupon us from behind the African hills, which stood in distinct outline\r\nbefore us at the distance of twelve miles. Then every heart bounded\r\nwith hope, and the fading energies of life revived within us. We\r\ngreeted the glad spectacle with our morning incense, and poured out our\r\nthanksgiving to God our Ebenezer. There was a beautiful propriety in\r\nthe subject of our song, which then rose on the morning air, from the\r\nmargin of that mighty ocean. It was Psalm xlvi.,\r\n\r\n    \"God is our refuge and our strength,\r\n       In straits a present aid;\r\n     Therefore although the earth remove,\r\n       We will not be afraid.\r\n\r\n     Though hills amidst the seas be cast,\r\n       Though waters roaring make\r\n     And troubled be; yea, _though the hill\r\n       By swelling seas do shake_.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had these sublime words passed our lips, ere we felt the awful\r\nimportance and value of the holy sentiment. Our eyes could now detect\r\na long line of frowning and iron-bound coast, fringed only with foam,\r\nand hoary with tremendous breakers. No friendly opening was visible,\r\nalong that fearful barrier, and we looked in vain for some quiet creek\r\namid the strife, where ocean might peacefully surrender the helpless\r\ncharge which longed for escape from its horrors. As if to increase\r\nthe solemnity of our condition, the wind at this time began to rise,\r\nand a heavy ground swell rolled in from the south-west, so that it\r\nneeded no ordinary faith to prepare with calmness for the approaching\r\ncrisis. But our only course was to face the danger, and trust to God\r\nfor deliverance. I sent the small boat ahead, to examine the coast, if\r\npossible to find a creek for convenient landing, it being lighter than\r\nour boat, and having thafts for easy rowing, which we had not. I then\r\nsought to rally the spirits of my crew by a little exertion; getting\r\nout the oars, I exhorted them to try the exercise of rowing a little,\r\nand took a spell myself. With great difficulty I succeeded in inducing\r\nthe most of them to make the attempt, and we felt the benefit of the\r\neffort, in a freer circulation of our blood, which served to relax our\r\nstiffened joints, and relieved us of the cold shivering.\r\n\r\nThe breeze continued strong, and the sea was very heavy, until we\r\napproached within half a mile of the shore; when God--as if in sympathy\r\nwith our situation, and preparing our way--subdued the wind, and made\r\nthe strife of waters partially to subside. This gracious interposition\r\nmade a deep impression upon us all, and we felt animated by it, in our\r\nvery critical circumstances, as a foretaste of deliverance. At this\r\ntime, a small rock which appeared to windward, presented to our eager\r\neyes for a season the likeness of a sail; and we were delighted for the\r\nmoment with the idea, that the coast which we were approaching might\r\nbe inhabited; but a nearer view soon dispelled the illusion, and left\r\nus to a scene only of wild and desert solitude. Our small boat had now\r\ngone close in with the shore, in search of a landing-place, while we\r\nremained at a short distance on the outside, to wait for instructions.\r\nOur companions, in their eagerness to execute their survey, had\r\nunfortunately got themselves embayed, and in attempting to weather a\r\nprojecting point, they failed; so that, in their extremity, one course\r\nonly remained to them--for life or death they had to run for the beach.\r\nWe, seeing this sudden movement, and supposing that our friends had\r\ndiscovered a favourable landing-place, bore up, and followed closely\r\nin their track. By signs and cries they attempted to warn us off;\r\nbut we, mistaking their signals for encouragement, only pursued with\r\nincreasing speed. It was a moment of intense and trembling interest\r\nto us all; death or deliverance hung upon the instant, and our hearts\r\nwere fully alive to the immediate and awful alternative. Every faded\r\nand haggard countenance became flushed with eager excitement; every eye\r\nwas strained to watch on either hand the impending fate; every hand\r\ngrasped the gunwale with convulsive and trembling energy, and we held\r\nour breath in awe, as we dashed among the breakers, and plunged amid\r\nthose fearful rocks and shoals. Surely the eye of heaven was watching\r\nover us in that unchosen and accidental landing-scene; for amidst many\r\nperils, it presented favourable opportunities for us--in a narrow\r\nchannel among a cluster of small rocks, which was crowned with a sand\r\nbeach--that no human foresight could have detected, and that was rare\r\non that coast. Our small boat, indeed, was in extreme jeopardy; for in\r\nthe midst of the breakers it struck upon a sharp rock, and some of the\r\ncrew were thrown overboard by the shock. The sail, however, being still\r\nset, the next wave lifted it over, and the wind and sea being dead in\r\nshore, drove them right up to the beach, where, amid many difficulties,\r\nthey effected a landing, and rescued their comrades in a state of great\r\nexhaustion. We in the larger boat were somewhat more fortunate; for \"by\r\nthe good hand of God upon us,\" we made our way safely through a narrow\r\nchannel, among the small rocks, without touching, until we came within\r\na boat's length of the beach, where we stuck fast upon a rock. There\r\nbeing deep water between us and the shore, we were all plunged overhead\r\nin our attempts to escape; but the ladies and children being assisted\r\nby the mate and seamen, were soon placed in safety; and \"so it came to\r\npass, that we escaped all safe to land.\"\r\n\r\nThis signal deliverance--alike so gracious and remarkable--revealed in\r\nall its course and accomplishment, the direct and immediate agency of\r\nGod, and could be attributed solely to his marked interposition and\r\ncare. No human foresight or management could have availed to preserve\r\nso helpless a company in such extremities. With boats so frail, and\r\nmeans of sustenance so slender, nothing less than Omnipotent kindness\r\ncould have sustained us throughout a voyage so disproportionate to all\r\nour preparations, and so encompassed with exceeding dangers. If our\r\ncourse, indeed, revealed no miracles, it was at least replete with\r\nspecial mercies; for had we been visited by a few days of head winds,\r\nor been overtaken by any of the fearful squalls so common in Cape seas,\r\nor even made our landfall on a bold and unbroken coast, not one of us\r\nwould have survived in such a case to tell the tale of our disasters,\r\nand our last struggles would have been hid in the dark and terrible\r\nsecrets of ocean, which, like the grave, gives no revelations. We\r\nhad been led to look to God in all our way: even the good order and\r\ndiscipline which had been maintained, we felt we owed to his grace;\r\nand while we had used our best endeavours for our preservation, yet\r\nwithout his blessing, we were conscious that every exertion must have\r\nbeen without avail. Therefore, when God had \"been better to us than our\r\nfears,\" and \"redeemed our lives from destruction,\" our utmost gratitude\r\nwas due to him, and we invite men \"to see his hand,\" and \"to praise the\r\nLord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nIf it had been possible, at that solemn hour, to have forgotten\r\nor overlooked the signal kindness of heaven, even the continuous\r\nmanifestations of Divine goodness to us must have, on the instant,\r\nrebuked such base ingratitude. Scarcely had the feet of our forlorn\r\ncompany been permitted to touch the shore, when the storm, which had\r\nlulled previously to our landing, burst forth with redoubled fury,\r\nand raged without intermission during the whole time that we remained\r\nin that place. The sea arose in ungovernable wrath, and as it lashed\r\nthe shore, lifted our little boats upon its billows to a height of\r\nforty or fifty feet upon the beach. The narrow channel through which\r\nwe had reached the shore in safety instantly became one scene of\r\nboiling surge, which would have shattered to pieces the proudest bark,\r\nand engulphed every living thing on board of her. Who could fail to\r\ndiscover the striking proof of a special and gracious Providence in\r\nthis occurrence? If it be said that such sudden storms frequently\r\noccur in these latitudes, still the question arises,--why did that\r\nstorm come at the precise moment when we were immediately out of the\r\nreach of its fury? There can be but one answer to this inquiry,--it\r\nwas the good pleasure of him \"who gave to the sea its decree, that\r\nit cannot pass, and who compasseth its waters with bounds.\" Our\r\ncompany stood awe-stricken at the sight. We looked back upon the\r\nscene of destruction, from which we had so recently escaped, with\r\nmingled feelings of dismay and gratitude. Our deliverance, indeed,\r\nwas not yet complete. Alas! who could tell whether,--\"having escaped\r\nthe sea,--vengeance might yet suffer us to live?\" \"The perils of the\r\nwilderness\" lay before us in all their unknown horrors of toil, and\r\nthirst, and frightful famine. Still we had been delivered from \"the\r\nfloods that affrighted us,\"--our bosoms swelled with the full sense\r\nof our rescue, and while we raised our song of deliverance and poured\r\nout our grateful prayers to God, there were many devout hearts in our\r\ncircle who could appropriate the sentiment of the poet:--\r\n\r\n    Thus far on life's perplexing path,\r\n    Thus far the Lord our steps hath led;\r\n    Safe from the _flame's_ pursuing wrath,\r\n    Unharmed though _floods_ hung o'er our head.\r\n    Here let us pause--look back--adore,\r\n    Like ransom'd Israel from the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MELANCHOLY MARCH THROUGH THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n    \"They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way, they found\r\n    no city to dwell in. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in\r\n    them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he\r\n    delivered them out of their distresses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first view of our solitary landing-place revealed to us a wild and\r\nbarren region. Neither traces of cultivation, nor marks of human abode,\r\nnor even tracks of living creature, met our eye in all the adjacent\r\nlandscape; and my heart misgave me at the prospect, lest we had only\r\nexchanged the scene of our miseries, but not escaped from them. The\r\nidea of delay in obtaining succours was too painful to indulge, for\r\nevery hour only added to the horrors of our situation.\r\n\r\nOur scanty supplies were rapidly wasting away, and the strength of the\r\npeople was already well nigh spent by fatigue and famine. I dared not\r\nto anticipate the consequences of even a short continuance of such a\r\nstate of things, and felt that our utmost efforts must be directed to\r\nurgent measures for immediate deliverance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, every arrangement was made for present exigencies. A small\r\nrefreshment was distributed immediately after landing, and our weary\r\nmen set about the erection of tents, which were soon reared, by lashing\r\na few spars together and overlaying them with sails and blankets.\r\nThis shelter was peculiarly seasonable to persons, who, for nine days\r\nand nights had not known the luxury of lying down, or resting their\r\nexhausted frames; especially as an African sun was blazing in noon-tide\r\nbrilliancy, and with insufferable fierceness over our heads. Our wasted\r\npeople soon betook themselves to repose and I was pleased to find that\r\nthe greater number of them were soon lost in sweet forgetfulness of\r\nall their woes. As for myself, sleep had so long been a stranger to my\r\naching frame, that it refused at first to revisit me, and my mind was\r\ntoo anxiously concerned for the future to court its present approach.\r\nSo soon, therefore, as I found the others asleep, Mr. Wallace the mate,\r\nand I--who had lain down together, and were alike wakeful--rose up\r\nand went forth to consult as to our future course of proceeding. We\r\nwere agreed in thinking that the parched and desolate appearance of\r\nthe place gave little hope of finding water, or of obtaining relief;\r\nand that our whole and instant efforts must be directed to discover\r\nsuccours by sea or land. Two courses only presented themselves: the\r\nfirst, which was to re-enter the boats, and endeavour to reach the\r\nCape colony by sea, was plainly impracticable from the severity of the\r\nweather; the sea at that moment being visible below us in its wildest\r\nmajesty, as it thundered its mountainous billows against the base of\r\nthe rocks, and scattered its angry foam over the cliffs to a hundred\r\nand twenty feet above its bed. Besides, we were conscious that even in\r\ncalmest weather, our company could not possibly survive for twenty-four\r\nhours, under a renewed exposure and crowding in the boats, without a\r\nfresh supply of water and provisions. We were shut up, therefore, to\r\nthe only available alternative of seeking succour by a land journey,\r\nand by keeping a southerly course in the direction of the Cape, we\r\nhoped that we might soon reach some human habitation. I proposed that\r\nwe should remain till the expiry of the following day, in order to\r\nrecruit our people for the journey, and to complete the necessary\r\npreparations for our departure. Meanwhile a search could be made for\r\nwater, and I would endeavour to obtain an observation at noon, in order\r\nto certify our exact latitude, and ascertain our distance from the\r\nCape. This course was afterwards submitted to the whole company, and as\r\nit met their approval, it was adopted.\r\n\r\nWe had carried George Peat ashore from the boat in a dying state. Every\r\nthing was done for his comfort which our circumstances would permit,\r\nbut the poor lad was beyond the reach of relief. He lingered in painful\r\nunconsciousness till the following morning, when he died. The body\r\nof John Chisholm was also brought on shore in the skiff, and covered\r\nwith the Union Jack, until we had leisure to dig a grave. The two\r\nyouths were respectfully buried on the successive afternoons, divine\r\nservice being performed at their interment. They lie side by side on\r\nthat desert shore where they met their fate, and their pilgrimage\r\nceased,--where no footstep of friendship shall ever trace the unknown\r\nscene of their last repose, and only the murmurs of ocean disturb its\r\nsolitary stillness.\r\n\r\nAfter evening service had been conducted in the tent, we kindled a fire\r\nto preserve us from any attacks of wild beasts, and committed ourselves\r\nto rest. I enjoyed a few hours of sweet sleep that evening, for the\r\nfirst time after my long watching, and awoke considerably refreshed\r\nand invigorated. By four o'clock in the morning our whole party were\r\nastir, and went off in detachments at daylight, to search for water;\r\nbut after wandering for two hours, in survey of all the surrounding\r\ncoast, they returned, as we feared, dispirited and unsuccessful. A\r\nvegetable was found in great abundance which was full of sap, but on\r\ntasting it we discovered that it was saturated with salt, and unfit\r\nfor use. The only supply which the region afforded was shell-fish,\r\nwhich for the same reason, with our scanty allowance of water, could\r\nonly be sparingly used. The situation of our tent in the low grounds\r\nwas now found to be insufferable on account of the intense heat, so\r\nthat I proposed to shift it to the rising ground behind, in order to\r\nobtain a freer circulation of air. But our people were so feeble as to\r\nbe unfit for the exertion, and it was only after great labour, and by\r\nbribing them with a tea-spoonful of wine, that this measure of relief\r\nwas accomplished. The ladies meanwhile were employed, in preparations\r\nfor our journey of the following day, by making canvass bags to hold\r\nour provisions; and the precious remainder of water was emptied from\r\nthe cask into bottles and jars, so as to be easy of carriage on the\r\nroad. I could only get an overhead observation for the latitude at\r\nnoon, in consequence of the sun being over the land. My calculation\r\nagreed with my previous conjecture, that we were north of the Oliphant\r\n(or Elephant's) River, about eleven miles; but as Norie's Epitome,\r\nwhich was my only book of reference snatched from the burning ship,\r\ngave me no example for working such an altitude, I could not certify\r\nthe accuracy of the reckoning. However, my repeated trials convinced\r\nme that I could not be more than a mile or two from the truth, and we\r\ndetermined, therefore, to start in that direction on the morrow, in the\r\nhope of finding some settlement on the river's banks.\r\n\r\nOur preparations for departure being completed, we lay down to\r\nsleep, under the same precautions as on the previous night, and were\r\naroused at four o'clock to pursue our journey. Previous to starting,\r\nI distributed among the ladies and cabin passengers, so far as they\r\nwould go, seven of my white shirts to serve as change of linen, they\r\nhaving been discovered in the boat on our landing. We had at this time\r\nsix days' allowance of water, at the rate of three bottles a day to our\r\ntwenty-six persons, or scarcely three table-spoonfuls to each, which,\r\nin our already fevered and maddening thirst, and under a broiling\r\ntropical sun, was not nearly sufficient to sustain life. A small\r\nsurplus, however, was found in the water-cask after all our bottles\r\nwere filled, which was distributed among the company, and served to\r\nrefresh us at departure. We broke some oars for carrying-poles, and\r\ndistributed the stores among the responsible persons in the company,\r\nwith strict injunctions that they should restrict themselves to the\r\ngeneral allowance, as any breach of fidelity might sacrifice the lives\r\nof the whole party. After the celebration of divine worship, in which\r\nwe committed our way to God, we set out on our melancholy journey. Our\r\nroad lay before us through \"a waste howling wilderness,\" and we \"went\r\nout, not knowing whither we went;\" but our trust was in that God, \"who\r\nhad found Israel in a desert land, and kept him as the apple of his\r\neye,\" and we hoped that he would lead us also forth \"by a right way,\r\nthat we might go to a place of habitation.\"\r\n\r\nOur company presented a most wretched appearance in the march, and we\r\nsoon proved ourselves to be indeed miserable travellers. Our limbs\r\nhad swelled to an inordinate size in consequence of our confinement\r\nand exposure in the boats, and they were so stiffened with inactivity\r\nas only to be dragged along with difficulty. The ground over which we\r\ntoiled our way was unfavourable for progress in our faint condition,\r\nbeing, for the most part, loose and sandy, and occasionally tangled\r\nwith small shrubs: and as we went our way, struggling, and staggering\r\nbeneath our light loads, we bore a striking resemblance to the last\r\nremnant of a famished garrison, or the latest fugitive survivors of a\r\nsiege. We accomplished about a mile, when we sat down to rest,\r\nand stripped ourselves of all our upper clothing, on account of the\r\noppressive heat. After a short pause we again resumed our journey,\r\nand with great difficulty reached a similar distance. It was only\r\nafter much persuasion that I induced them again to stir; but there was\r\nno shelter in the place from the fierce rays of the sun; and I was\r\nextremely anxious, in our desperate circumstances, which were every\r\nmoment growing darker, to make all the progress possible. About noon\r\nwe discovered two huts under the cliff, and were of course anxious to\r\nreach them; but they were inaccessible to us, in our weak condition. We\r\nhalloed, however, with all our might, to find if they had any inmates;\r\nbut as \"there was no voice that answered, neither any that regarded,\"\r\nwe justly concluded that they were uninhabited, and could furnish\r\nno relief to us, so that we turned mournfully away, and pursued our\r\njourney. I afterwards learned that these huts belonged to a fishing\r\ncompany, and were deserted; a few casks of water were kept there, for\r\nthe supply of their vessels, but these were kept under ground, so that\r\nwe would have found no relief by visiting the place, and most probably\r\nwould have perished in the attempt. Soon after we likewise descried\r\ntraces of a path which led into the interior, which some of our people\r\nwere inclined to follow; but I dissuaded them from the attempt, as the\r\ncoast was the coolest region, as well as the most likely to lead us to\r\nwater; whereas we might only wander in the wilderness to die the most\r\nhorrid death. We accomplished altogether about six miles by this day's\r\njourney, and halted at last, in utter exhaustion, on a promontory,\r\nwhere we were exposed to the sea breeze.\r\n\r\nOn collecting our party, to overhaul our stock, I found that one of\r\nthe cabin passengers, who had been quite delirious for some days,\r\nhaving fallen behind us on the day's march, on account of weakness, had\r\ncast away his coat, containing two bottles of water, from anxiety to\r\novertake his party. Every search was made for this lost treasure and\r\nvaluable supply, but to no purpose. To add to the misfortune, another\r\ncabin passenger, from whose education I might have expected better\r\nconduct, alone, of all the people, proved himself unworthy of trust.\r\nOf the two bottles committed to his charge, one was found empty. He\r\nhad stolen from his party during the day, under pretence of tracking\r\nthe path into the interior, and the temptation proving too strong for\r\nhim, he had consumed a whole bottle for his own use. This I concealed\r\nfrom our people, for I am certain that, if they had known it, they\r\nwould have taken his life on the spot. But I was deeply grieved to find\r\nthat a whole day's supply of this scarce and vital commodity had been\r\nlost to us through the imbecility and profligacy of our companions. To\r\nprevent the recurrence of such a calamity, which would have endangered\r\nthe lives of all of us, I put the water, henceforth, under the charge\r\nof my confidential seamen; and after our evening's repast and prayers,\r\nwe betook ourselves to sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring night a heavy dew fell, mingled with a few drops of rain, which\r\nroused us from our slumbers, and our people commenced greedily to suck\r\nthe moisture from the blankets; but they having been soaked by sea\r\nwater, and only dried in the sun, were so impregnated with salt that we\r\nsoon desisted from an endeavour which brought us no relief. As morning\r\ndawned our pleasing expectation of rain departed, and with heavy hearts\r\nwe prepared to pursue our course. The condition of our people at this\r\ntime was extremely distressing, their faces had become bloated and\r\ndisfigured, and their lips were rent and chapped, while the painful\r\nswelling in the arms and legs was rapidly on the increase, so that I\r\napprehended some of them would not be able to hold on till night. I\r\nsought to rally their downcast spirits, by feigning a cheerfulness\r\nwhich I did not feel, and pointing to some mountains in the south-east,\r\nI prompted them to proceed, by assuring them, that wherever mountains\r\nappeared, water was always to be found. I was certain, moreover, by the\r\ncalculations which I had made, that we could not be more than five\r\nmiles from Oliphant River, where I felt assured that relief would be\r\nafforded. We made indeed most wretched progress in that morning's\r\njourney; ere three quarters of a mile had been accomplished, we were\r\ncompelled to halt, and after receiving our allowance and singing a\r\nhymn, we proceeded on our way. Scarcely another mile had been overtaken\r\nere we were again forced to rest ourselves, and here I felt alarmed\r\nlest some of the company should never be able to resume the march.\r\nThe old gentleman, who had lost his coat on the previous day, was\r\nespecially overcome; he seemed so thoroughly exhausted in spirit,\r\nand so worn out in frame--being covered over with sores in face and\r\nlimbs--that it seemed impossible to rouse him to any further effort,\r\nand others were inclined, with him, to resign themselves to despair. I\r\nwas greatly perplexed how to act in this extremity. I could not bear\r\nto leave the wretched alone to die; and to detain the others on their\r\naccount, would be certain destruction to us all. In this painful crisis\r\nI secretly sought direction from God, and had resolved to remain\r\nwith the desperate, leaving the others to press on, and send back for\r\nus if they should find succour. This purpose I only communicated to\r\nmy brother William, and urged him to use every exertion to reach a\r\nplace of safety, and in case of my death, to be kind to my dear wife\r\nand family. He, however, sternly refused to accede to my wishes, and\r\ndeclared his resolution, if I persisted, to abide and die with me.\r\nBy his persuasion I was shaken in my purpose, and by dint of great\r\nexertion, we managed to assist our invalids on through another stage.\r\n\r\nOn looking out for our next halting-place, I observed a rising ground\r\na little in advance of us, and urged our people to reach it ere they\r\nrested. This was done, because I thought something like the entrance of\r\na river appeared beyond, and I was resolved to ascertain the fact by\r\ncrowning the hill. We had nearly reached the place, when the mate, who\r\nwas a little in advance, cried out, \"There is the river.\" I ran forward\r\nat the transporting tidings, and by advancing a few paces, a scene\r\nof overpowering interest burst upon my view. Not only was the river\r\ndistinctly visible as it rolled its broad waters through a fertile\r\nvalley, until they mingled with ocean at our feet; but I could also\r\ndistinctly descry a settlement, with its dwelling-houses and offices,\r\non the opposite bank. Never did scene more sweet open upon human\r\nvision, than met my ecstatic gaze in that landscape. I had no eye--no\r\nheart for its natural beauties; but thoughts of life and of rescue\r\narose within me in that glance. It seemed to me an opening paradise:\r\nvisions of home--of happiness--rushed back upon my desolate soul. The\r\ntide of sorrow, in a heart ready to perish, was turned within me, and\r\njoy rose in such sudden revulsion from recent wretchedness, that I was\r\ncompletely overpowered. The same excess of emotion filled every heart\r\nthat now crowded around at the tidings. We grasped each other's hands\r\nin convulsive silence; our hearts were too full for utterance, and, for\r\na considerable time, tears were the only expression that came from\r\nour overcharged bosoms. Rapture was in our glance when we saw human\r\nbeings moving about on the opposite bank, and we became rivetted in\r\ndelighted gaze upon the neat white-washed house, with its clear blue\r\nsmoke curling up into the sky, and all the accompaniments of European\r\ncomfort around it. I was the first to break the interesting silence,\r\nby saying, \"Now, my dear friends, the Lord has led us by a way that\r\nwe knew not, to a land inhabited.\" We then gave thanks to God, who\r\nhad done so great things for us, and we served out a little of our\r\nremaining stock of water. As we were still a mile from the river, I\r\npreserved a small portion, in case the river water should prove salt,\r\nwhich, on reaching it, we found to be the case. We had carried our\r\nEnglish ensign as a signal in case of meeting any vessel, and now, by\r\ntying two broken oars together, we elevated it to attract the notice\r\nof the persons on the opposite bank. They evidently had descried us;\r\nfor we observed a boat push off from the shore, and advance straight\r\ntoward us across the stream. This was to us a gracious token that the\r\nseason of succour was at hand. We immediately thereupon drank off our\r\nlast remaining bottle of water, and prepared to greet our deliverers.\r\nThe moment of our rescue was especially interesting and solemn. While\r\nthe boat approached, we all joined hands and united in singing the 23d\r\nPsalm, and, as the faint concert arose from our famished group, it\r\nseemed, to our overflowing hearts, to ascend to heaven, alike as the\r\ndevout dirge of our departing sorrows, and the joyous anthem of our\r\ncoming deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n    \"When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and\r\n    their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them,\r\n    I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will make the\r\n    wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat, which seemed to our view like a messenger of mercy,\r\napproached within hail, when, with due precaution, it halted, and to\r\nour delightful surprise a voice in the English language demanded to\r\nknow who we were, and what was our business. We immediately declared\r\nour doleful story, when the party landed without farther ceremony,\r\nand told us that we had come among a Christian people. The meeting\r\nwas most affecting on either side; it was with difficulty that our\r\npeople, in the ecstasy of rescue, could refrain from falling down at\r\nthe feet of their deliverers; and the strangers, as they surveyed our\r\nemaciated and wretched company, were quite unable to suppress their\r\ntears. Our first appeal to them was for water, and they communicated\r\nthe joyful intelligence to us, that there was an excellent fountain\r\non the other side, where our wants would be abundantly supplied.\r\nI immediately embarked, in company with the ladies, and by three\r\nsuccessive trips, the whole of our people were safely landed on the\r\nother side, where we were all received with unbounded affection and\r\nhospitality. We instantly repaired, with incontrollable avidity, to the\r\nfountain, where we sought to satiate our maddening thirst by deep and\r\nfrequent draughts, until we had gorged ourselves with the exquisite\r\nsupply, and felt life reflow in cooler currents through our parched\r\nand fevered frames. A princely meal was also provided for us on the\r\ninstant, consisting of a whole sheep, and part of a wild buck, which\r\nhad been shot on the farm in the morning; but our hearts were too full\r\nto possess a keen appetite, and we could only taste of the bounteous\r\nprovision amid many tears, when we contrasted the scantiness and misery\r\nof our morning repast with our present profusion, and the hearts of\r\nmany of us rose in silent gratitude to \"God, who had done so great\r\nthings for us, whereof we were glad.\"\r\n\r\nWe found that the settlement which we had reached belonged to a\r\nwarm-hearted Dutch farmer, named Mynheer Low, of whose unbounded\r\ngenerosity and kindness it is impossible for me to speak in excessive\r\nterms. His family consisted of an amiable wife and daughter, who shared\r\nin all his own benevolence, and loaded us with attentions, which can\r\nnever be forgotten, and it would be impossible to repay.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, who had accompanied our host in the boat which ferried\r\nus over the river, and who acted as our interpreter during our stay,\r\nwas a sailor belonging to a whale and seal fishing company. He had been\r\nleft by his employers, in company with another person, to reside during\r\nthe fishing season, on a neighbouring island, in order to preserve the\r\nfishing grounds, which were rented from the colonial government. He and\r\nhis partner were obliged to visit the settlement very frequently for\r\nsupplies of water, which they required to keep, alike for their own\r\nuse, and in case of their schooner running short during her voyage. I\r\nlearned from this person that the coast to the north of Oliphant River\r\nis entirely destitute of water, and without inhabitants; and I mention\r\nthis in case any persons who peruse this narrative should be driven on\r\nthis coast, that they may know where to obtain succour. Mr. Low's farm\r\nis situated on the south bank of the Oliphant River, about four miles\r\nfrom the sea, and two hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nSoon after our arrival I communicated with Mr. Low as to the necessary\r\nprovision for our future accommodation. It was impossible with his\r\nlimited resources, that he could lodge and sustain twenty-six persons\r\nfor many days; and it was plain from the distressing condition of our\r\npeople, that they would require several days of careful nursing and\r\nrest, before they could bear removal by land journey.\r\n\r\nHaving learned that an English gentleman kept a store at Donkin's\r\nBay, twenty-four miles distant, I immediately despatched a messenger\r\nto solicit his assistance. This person, whose name was Mr. R. Fryer,\r\nproved to us to be indeed \"a brother born for adversity.\" No language\r\ncan adequately express his unremitting kindness and unceasing exertions\r\nfor our welfare, and for which he would never listen to any proposals\r\nof remuneration whatever. He came down on horseback immediately on\r\nreceiving notice of our condition, and despatched a message to the\r\nnearest field cornet, to make provision for our succour. On his arrival\r\nhe proposed to take the ladies at once to his house, they being the\r\nonly parties fit to be removed. It may seem strange that the most\r\ndelicate members of our company should have borne the hardships of our\r\nsituation with greater hardihood than men of robust frame; and yet\r\nit was remarkable throughout the whole of our afflictions, that the\r\nladies and even the children bore the sufferings with the greatest\r\nmagnanimity, and discovered a spirit of patient endurance which might\r\nhave put to shame the hardiest men. It is thus that God sometimes,\r\nas of old, \"out of weakness maketh strong,\" and causeth \"things that\r\nare not to be as though they were, that no flesh should glory in his\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this arrangement, our ladies set off in a waggon\r\nfor Mr. Fryer's house, under charge of our host's daughter, on the\r\nevening after our arrival at Oliphant River; and in twenty-four hours,\r\nthe waggon returned loaded with provisions, luxuries and medicines.\r\nMr. Fryer also sent four sheep on the same day, and gave his shepherd\r\norders to supply us with as many as we wanted; and yet these things\r\nwere but a tithe of the kindness which we received at the hands of this\r\ngood Samaritan.\r\n\r\nWe were at this time also under great obligations to Mr. Francis J.\r\nTroutar, who had come down the river at this time, along with his\r\nmother-in-law and a few servants, to fish. The good old lady took our\r\nthree children to her hut, supplied them with frocks and underclothing,\r\nand treated them with the solicitude and kindness of a mother, so as to\r\nmerit our warmest gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days, the effects of our long fasting and\r\nexposure and fatigues began to appear, and to make shocking havoc on\r\nthe persons of our people, in loathsome bloaches on the face, and\r\nexcessive swelling of the arms and legs. The steward was particularly\r\nin a pitiable condition with his face, and one of the cabin passengers\r\nwas confined to his couch. One of his legs burst, and his hand was\r\nobliged to be laid open by a deep incision of a razor, so that I\r\nwas afraid at one time, that he would not rally. In the course,\r\nhowever, of four or five days, through the unremitting nursing of the\r\nDutchman's family, and by the kind providence of God, we all began to\r\namend. Our recovery soon revealed itself in an incessant craving for\r\nfood; for some days it was almost impossible to satisfy our intense\r\nappetite, and we were in danger of creating a famine in the Dutchman's\r\nsettlement, as a sheep was killed every day for our use, and we\r\nconsumed great quantities of wheat, which we prepared for boiling by\r\npounding it in a mortar, and sometimes made into bread after grinding\r\nit in a hand-mill.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th January I received a letter from Mr. Rennyfield, civil\r\ncommissioner, Clan William, to meet him at Mr. Fryer's on the following\r\nday, in company with Mr. Troutar. We accordingly set off next morning,\r\nat five o'clock, and as I was but an indifferent horseman, I was\r\ngreatly exhausted by the ride. The country in this quarter is chiefly\r\nsandy, and blows with the wind like dust, but it is thickly studded\r\nwith sundry kinds of shrubs and bushes, which are valuable for the\r\nfeeding of cattle and sheep. On reaching my destination, I was most\r\nhospitably received by Mr. Fryer, and his lady, and was happy to find\r\nmy lady passengers in good health and spirits. The civil commissioner\r\nmade full arrangements with me for our journey to Cape Town. I\r\nreceived a letter to produce to each field cornet on the route,\r\ncontaining instructions to provide us with waggons, and to supply us\r\nwith every necessary on the road. Mr. Troutar, who was the field cornet\r\nof the district, was to provide the waggons and to be our conductor\r\nthrough the first stage; and our departure was arranged for the 19th of\r\nJanuary, by which time it was hoped that our invalids would be so far\r\nrecovered as to bear the journey.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed we prepared for our departure amidst much bustle\r\nand confusion. The yoking of fourteen or sixteen oxen in a waggon is\r\nlike getting an East India trader under weigh, and the chattering of\r\nthe Hottentots in the excitement of the occasion was quite amusing.\r\nThe scene of separation with our dear friends and deliverers was\r\nexquisitely affecting. The kind Dutchman's family were weeping aloud;\r\nMr. Troutar's mother-in-law clung to our little orphan family, and\r\nrefused to part with them; even the Hottentots could not refrain their\r\ntears. I confess that I never felt myself so unmanned in my life, and\r\nit was only after an hour had been wasted in ineffectual efforts to\r\nsay farewell, that by a desperate resolution we at last tore ourselves\r\naway. They followed us for a short distance, and then stood, and waved\r\ntheir hands as long as we could see them. Thus we parted from kind\r\nstrangers, who had entwined themselves around our hearts in fondest\r\nendearments; and while memory holds her seat in our bosoms, I trust\r\nthat we shall never cease to pray for richest blessings on the heads of\r\nour benevolent friends of the Oliphant River.\r\n\r\nWe reached Mr. Fryer's at Donkin's Bay about midnight, where our\r\nparty was rejoined by the ladies, and we remained in the enjoyment of\r\nthis excellent family's hospitality until the next afternoon. Another\r\npainful scene of leave-taking had here to be repeated, and it was with\r\ndifficulty that our ladies could command themselves in parting, from\r\none who had proved so lavish in his generosity to all of us in our\r\ndistress. \"May the Lord reward him,\" and \"think upon him for good,\"\r\naccording to all the kindness that he showed unto us.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enter into minute details of our land journey to\r\nthe Cape. It presented all the usual adventures of that tedious mode\r\nof travel;--sometimes ploughing sandy deserts deep to the axles,--and\r\noccasionally land-locked by an interminable maze of tangled brushwood.\r\nFrequently we lost our path in the darkness, the over-laboured brutes\r\nwere many times at a stand-still from exhaustion, and scarcity of\r\nwater; and once or twice, we had nearly suffered a second _shipwreck\r\nin the desert_, to the great alarm of the ladies, and not without the\r\nhazard of broken bones.\r\n\r\nMr. Troutar accompanied us with his waggons and cattle, through several\r\ndreary stages, until we reached Mr. Vanzells' farm. This gentleman\r\nwas uncle to our worthy conductor, and also a field cornet. Here\r\nwe obtained fresh cattle, and started under a new convoy. It was\r\nwith extreme regret that we parted from Mr. Troutar, whose kind and\r\ngentlemanly deportment had endeared him to us all. I was also compelled\r\nto leave Mr. Harris our cabin passenger here, under charge of our\r\nsurgeon, as he was so ill as to be unable to proceed; Mr. Vanzells\r\npromising to forward both gentlemen to Cape Town on horseback, so soon\r\nas Mr. Harris was able to bear the journey. After travelling by uneasy\r\nstages for several days, we crossed the Peak Berg range of mountains,\r\nthe Boers throughout treating us with unvarying kindness, and we\r\nfurnishing much amusement to the inquisitive and simple people, by the\r\nstrangeness of our dress, and speech, and psalmody.\r\n\r\nAt length on the 28th January at midnight, we entered Cape Town,\r\nfatigued with our journeyings in the wilderness, and happy in being\r\nable once more to mingle in the society of our countrymen. The luxury\r\nof a good bed, which for the first time I had here enjoyed, since\r\nleaving the ship, could not induce me to sleep. The whole scene of\r\ndangers and deliverances, through which the Lord had led us, here rose\r\nvividly before my view, and I could not refrain from giving fervent\r\nthanks to Him, \"who had not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded\r\nus according to our iniquities.\" He had indeed \"chastened us sore, but\r\nhe had not given us over to death;\" and we could adopt the language of\r\nthe Psalmist, \"Thou, who hast showed us great and sore troubles, shalt\r\nquicken us again, and bring us again from the depths of the earth.\" \"So\r\nwill we sing praises unto thy name for ever.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, on the morning of the 29th January, I\r\nwaited on Colonel Bell, at that time Deputy-Governor of the Cape,\r\nand represented to him the miserable condition in which my crew and\r\npassengers were. He immediately sent for one of his officers to\r\naccompany me to our lodgings, and to make arrangements for the payment\r\nof our board. Being in miserable plight for want of clothing, I was\r\nat this time greatly indebted to Captain Christie of London, who\r\npresented me with an excellent suit of his own. I had the pleasure,\r\nalso, of meeting an excellent friend in Dr. Brown (belonging originally\r\nto my native town of Peterhead), who took me to his own house, and\r\nentertained me most hospitably during my stay at the Cape. Meanwhile,\r\nthe merchants and gentlemen of the place opened a public subscription\r\non our behalf, which was handsomely headed by Colonel Bell, and soon\r\namounted to the sum of £120. By this money, a sum equal to a month's\r\nwages, was distributed in clothing to each of the crew, and the\r\npassengers received a similar supply, in equitable proportions,--the\r\nthree children being fully furnished with all necessaries for the\r\ncontinuance of their voyage, and the ladies being supplied with\r\nclothing and a little money. I also received £10 of this money, along\r\nwith a letter of commendation, and I am thus minute in detailing the\r\nbenevolence of the people of Cape Colony, as it is deserving, alike of\r\npersonal gratitude and public praise.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was now made to forward the passengers to their\r\ndestinations, and to dispose of the crew by drafting them into\r\ndifferent ships. After a little exertion, this was happily accomplished\r\non behalf of all, with the exception of two steerage passengers, who\r\npreferred to accept of situations in the colony. So soon as I had thus\r\ndischarged my obligations to the people under my care, I began to think\r\nhow to dispose of myself. After various friendly offers of employment,\r\nnone of which exactly suited me, I finally accepted of a passage home\r\nin a London schooner belonging to Mr. Fletcher, and bound to Bristol.\r\nMy kind friends in Cape Town affectionately accompanied me to the ship,\r\nand, after taking grateful leave of them, our vessel set sail for\r\nEngland, and in due season, \"by the good hand of my God upon me,\" I\r\nreturned in peace to the bosom of my wife and family.\r\n\r\nThus terminated a voyage replete with judgment and mercies. In the\r\nreview of its \"affliction and misery--the wormwood and the gall--my\r\nsoul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled within me.\" And\r\n\"may my right hand forget its cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof\r\nof my mouth,\" if I forget that \"God who answered us in the day of our\r\ndistress, and was with us in the way in which we went.\" I trust also\r\nthat the same spirit and resolution may abide upon all the survivors\r\nof that disastrous voyage which appeared in the day of our calamity.\r\nEven the most indifferent in religious things there owned that it was\r\n\"a good thing to call upon God,\" and \"poured out a prayer when his\r\nchastening hand was upon them.\" May it never be said of any of us that\r\n\"we flattered him with our mouth, and lied unto him with our tongues,\"\r\nor that \"we forgat God and remembered not his wonders.\" The solemn\r\nprofessions which we then made are still before his throne, and He will\r\nnever forget, however we may, the extraordinary obligations under which\r\nwe lie, to dedicate our spared lives to His service. O that we may\r\nevery day perform the vows which \"our lips uttered--our mouths spake\r\nwhen trouble was upon us;\" and that our future lives may realize the\r\nholy resolution of the man of God: \"Thou hast delivered my soul from\r\ndeath, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling; therefore I will\r\nwalk before the Lord in the land of the living.\"\r\n\r\nAnd surely this simple tribute to Divine goodness carries with it\r\na solemn message to every reader's heart. How impressively does it\r\ndeclare _uncertainty of life, even in moments of greatest seeming\r\nsecurity_. It was when least expecting it, that the foregoing\r\ncalamities came. And who can tell how soon God may disturb our dreams\r\nof security, by the summons to the judgment seat? \"We stand in jeopardy\r\nevery hour.\" In a world so full of sorrow and evil, we are daily\r\nexposed to the visitation of death. And does it not become us, in such\r\ncircumstances, \"to be always ready--to have our loins girt, and our\r\nlamps burning, and be like men that wait for the coming of the Lord?\"\r\n\"O that we were wise--that we understood this, that we would consider\r\nour latter end.\" Sailors, above most men, ought especially to cultivate\r\nthis spirit of habitual preparedness. Their calling preeminently\r\nexposes them to peril, and they are found \"in deaths oft.\" The breeze\r\nthat fills their sails, and wafts them to their destination, may\r\nswell into tempest, and become \"the breath of the blast of Jehovah's\r\nnostrils\" for their destruction. The ocean that spreads around them\r\na peaceful pathway to distant lands, may heave into huge and hoary\r\nbillows, that yawn only to engulf them in its horrid grave. The very\r\nshore that greets them with gladness after long absence, may be changed\r\ninto a scene of fatal shipwreck, and death find them at the very door\r\nof supposed deliverance. Who does not feel as he treads the deck of\r\nhis gallant vessel, that death is lurking near him in every element\r\nthat lies over, and around, and underneath his feet; and that God is\r\nproclaiming, at every moment, in all the voice of nature, \"As the Lord\r\nliveth, and as thy soul liveth, _there is but a step between thee\r\nand death_.\" And can we be safe, in such circumstances, to live in\r\nunpreparedness for that which may meet us the next moment, and must\r\nmeet us ere long? Or ought we to feel satisfied, in any circumstances,\r\nif we be living in a state of enmity with God? What can the sinner\r\ndo, and whither shall he flee, when judgments overtake him? He cannot\r\nlook up to a neglected and angry God; he dare not look down upon an\r\nundone eternity; nothing remains for him but \"a fearful looking for of\r\njudgment and of fiery indignation to destroy him as an adversary.\" Why,\r\noh why, should we live in such a state of defenceless danger--exposed\r\nat every accident to the destroying vengeance of heaven? Is not a\r\ndivine Saviour now offering us not only his protection, but also his\r\npropitiation? The merit of his sacrifice is able to screen all who\r\nconfide in it, not only from temporal danger, but also from eternal\r\ndestruction. Let us seek our present safety, in acceptance with God,\r\nthrough the blood of Immanuel; and we shall find our security from all\r\nfuture evils in the covert of his covenant. Then, \"though we walk in\r\nthe midst of trouble his right hand will save us,\" and we shall face\r\nevery danger with a fearless confidence, while we can exclaim--\"The\r\nLord of Hosts is on our side, the God of Jacob is our refuge.\" For\r\nImmanuel shall be \"an hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the\r\ntempest, as rivers of waters in a dry place, and as the shadow of a\r\ngreat rock in a weary land.\"\r\n\r\nIf any truth be confirmed by the foregoing narrative, it is the truth\r\nof God's word, that \"the Lord is good--a stronghold in the day of\r\ntrouble, and he knoweth them that trust in him.\" The \"profiting\" of\r\nprayer in such a case must \"be apparent to all.\" It was the smallest\r\npart of its advantages that it preserved order, and prevented\r\nexcess,--that it filled the fainting hearts of the crew and passengers\r\nwith courage, and renewed their strength when they were sinking fast\r\ninto despair. It did more; their eyes turned heavenward in their\r\nhelplessness, and they found a power superior to their own, interpose\r\nfor their deliverance. These poor men cried, and \"_the Lord heard\r\nthem_, and delivered them out of all their distresses.\" If any reader\r\nshould doubt the truth of this conclusion, or deny it, let him go and\r\n\"prove God,\" by the same means; let him \"in everything by prayer and\r\nsupplication make known his request to God;\" and if his prayer be\r\nsincere the gracious answer will be certain; his own experience will\r\nbut accord with the infallible testimony of all ages. \"Ye shall seek\r\nme and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.\" \"FOR\r\nTHIS SHALL EVERY ONE THAT IS GODLY PRAY UNTO THEE IN A TIME WHEN THOU\r\nMAYEST BE FOUND; SURELY IN THE FLOODS OF GREAT WATERS THEY SHALL NOT\r\nCOME NIGH UNTO HIM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been standardised.
