A disastrous business venture made it necessary to\r\ncurtail expenses. Rent being an especially heavy item, the hunt for a\r\ncheaper habitation commenced. Toiling up and down innumerable stuffy\r\nstaircases in tow of slatternly janitors revealed the fact that cheap\r\nflats were either over-crowded barracks redolent of dirty soapsuds\r\nand stale cooking, or overdecorated cubbyholes where children were\r\ntabooed. Evening after evening for two weeks I returned home weary and\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\nThen chance, in the shape of a poultry show, came to my relief.\r\nInstead of a cheap flat and semi-dark rooms, why not a house and\r\ngarden, where we could have chickens, eggs and vegetables of our own?\r\nFriends scoffed; and even my husband, who had always joined me in\r\nplanning the ideal home of our old age, as a place far from the noise\r\nand rush of the city, where we could indulge our love of flowers and\r\nanimals, demurred at first, though he eventually became imbued with my\r\nenthusiasm, and told me to go ahead if I felt equal to shouldering the\r\nresponsibilities which city duties would obviously prevent his sharing.\r\n\r\nHe stipulated also that transportation to and from his business in the\r\ncity, and all other expenses, should come within the newly necessary\r\ncurtailment of expenses, which limited rent to twenty-five dollars a\r\nmonth and the housekeeping allowance to twelve dollars a week; that\r\nnone of our very limited capital should be risked, excepting one\r\nhundred dollars to cover expense of moving, etc., and that even this\r\nsum should be considered as a loan. To satisfy the dear man’s cautious,\r\nmasculine ideas of fairness, I took twenty-four hours to consider the\r\nconditions, and then, with solemn, businesslike gravity, accepted.\r\n\r\nA painstaking advertisement in a Sunday paper, stating plainly that we\r\nwanted a small farm near the city and a railway station, the rent not\r\nto exceed fifteen dollars a month, brought dozens of letters offering\r\nall sorts of places at all sorts of distances and prices, but only six\r\nreal answers. With the writers of these six letters I corresponded;\r\nstudied innumerable railway guides; took several fruitless journeys;\r\nhesitated about two or three places, then just stumbled upon the right\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt is like choosing a new hat or garment. You like that one, but\r\nthis one is more becoming. You suddenly see something else quite\r\ndifferent--hesitancy is over; the unconscious ideal is found.\r\n\r\nThe house was long and low and white, standing at the end of the road,\r\nfacing a somewhat neglected, old-fashioned flower garden, which verged\r\ninto five acres of orchard bounded by a river. The man who was driving\r\nme didn’t know to whom the place belonged. I got out, looked in at the\r\nwindows, made out that there was a wide hall through the centre and two\r\nbig old-fashioned fireplaces and a lot of odd cupboards.\r\n\r\nOutside there was a wood-shed, summer kitchen, small smoke-house, barn,\r\ncow shed, corn-crib and chicken house. My original destination was\r\nforgotten. I was driven back to the station; found out who the owner\r\nwas, and where he lived; drove over there, and ascertained that the\r\nhouse contained four large rooms and one small one, kitchen, pantry and\r\ntwo cellars downstairs, and five rooms and an attic upstairs.\r\n\r\nThere are one hundred and eighty acres of land or more, but the\r\nlandlord would divide it to suit good tenants, which he evidently\r\nthought we would be, for subsequently we arranged to take the house,\r\nbuildings, orchard, twelve acres of farm land and four acres of\r\nwoodland on a three years’ lease, at a rental of fifteen dollars a\r\nmonth, with the privilege of taking the remainder of the land at any\r\ntime during our tenancy for an extra five dollars a month, and an\r\noption of purchase.\r\n\r\nReally, it seemed too good to be true, for it was within the prescribed\r\ndistance from the city and depot, the price of commutation being\r\nonly six dollars a month. The river, the old-fashioned garden with\r\nits two great catalpa trees shading the house, and the beauty of the\r\nsurrounding scenery, made it almost a realization of our ideal home.\r\nThankful joy filled our hearts even before we had experienced the\r\nglorious invigoration of an industrious outdoor life on the farm, where\r\neach day brings some new interest.\r\n\r\nAll our goods and chattels, including two cats and a canary, were\r\npacked in two vans, which took them the entire twenty-eight miles for\r\nthirty dollars. A kitchen stove cost thirty-five dollars; three wash\r\ntubs, four lamps and a few necessary tools absorbed another twenty-five\r\ndollars; and the last ten of the hundred dollars was spent in straw\r\nmatting, which we divided between two bedrooms.\r\n\r\nOf course, I had to start at the very bottom of the ladder, buying only\r\nwith the money that I could save from week to week from my housekeeping\r\nallowance. A few hens, a few ducks, gradually through the poultry\r\nfamily, then an incubator and brooder, to the dignity of a horse and\r\ncow; after whose acquisition, the home became self-supporting, the\r\nthird year showing a surplus profit.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were difficulties and troubles to be overcome,\r\nbut they were all the direct result of my own ignorance. A friend\r\nwell posted in country-home making, from whom I could have acquired\r\nvicarious experience, would have prevented most of them. Hence my\r\ndesire to pass on to practical lessons, learned during the last sixteen\r\nyears, for the benefit of other women.\r\n\r\nOur old-fashioned white house and shady garden might not appeal\r\nto every one, but no matter what individual taste may demand in\r\narchitecture and environment, there are certain points which must be\r\nobserved to insure the health and happiness which we all desire. The\r\nhouse must be on high ground, with good subdrainage. How to be sure of\r\nthe latter point puzzled me, until an old real-estate man, in answer to\r\nmy praise of a place we were passing, said:\r\n\r\n“Handsome? Yes, but it is a death trap. Dig a hole six feet deep\r\nanywhere around the house, and in twelve hours there will be water at\r\nthe bottom of it.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this place was not on his list, but the hint was a\r\ngood one and has been remembered. Wet meadows and spring ponds may give\r\nno anxiety, but stagnant water is dangerous, for it breeds mosquitoes\r\nand malaria. Fortunately, it is generally easily abolished; an\r\nable-bodied man with a shovel can usually dig a gutter to some near-by\r\nfall in the natural grade of the land that will drain it. Mosquitoes\r\nwere one of our troubles for two years; then three hours’ work banished\r\ntheir breeding-ground.\r\n\r\nAs it is a permanent home, and not a summer camp, which is being\r\nselected, shelter from cold winds is important. The woodland on our\r\nplace protected barns, house and orchard. If there is no natural\r\nwind-break, and the place is satisfactory enough otherwise to make\r\nyou contemplate buying it in future, it will be wise to plant out\r\nquick-growing trees, which usually can be bought for little or nothing\r\nin the country, and transplanted when quite a good size. Inexpensive\r\ncountry houses do not have furnaces, and like us, you may not be able\r\nto afford one for a year or two.\r\n\r\nWe found that two large stoves, with the pipes arranged to pass through\r\nthe ceiling and into radiators in the rooms above, and thence into the\r\nchimney, would heat four rooms. The pipe of the kitchen range can be\r\nutilized in the same way. Stoves with cracks and poor fire bricks waste\r\nfuel and warmth, so don’t try to economise on stoves.\r\n\r\nWe have always used an open hearth in the living-room, because it\r\nlooks so cheerily comfortable, and a door at the opposite end of the\r\nroom opens into the dining-room, allowing the air from there to come\r\nin, and so preventing the cold backs which are the usual drawback of a\r\npicturesque open fire.\r\n\r\nOne of the joys of depending on stoves is being able to regulate the\r\nheat in each room to meet all conditions. Our apartment in town was of\r\nthe better class, yet just as surely as an extra cold snap arrived,\r\nso surely did the heating apparatus get out of order. Another horror\r\nwas the “kling-kling” of the pipes in the dark, uncanny hours of the\r\nmorning, when every well-regulated human being ought to be allowed to\r\nsleep in peace.\r\n\r\nHaving plenty of wood, we used what are called “air-tight chunk\r\nstoves” instead of coal, excepting in the kitchen. And truly we have\r\nnever experienced any trouble in keeping the entire house _hot_ in\r\nthe bitterest weather. But we took precautions, such as keeping the\r\nputty around the window panes in good order. We used sandbags on the\r\nledges, mats at the doors, and red building paper (which has no odor)\r\nor several thicknesses of newspaper under the floor covering. Then we\r\nopened most of the windows for a few minutes every morning, and let in\r\nfresh air.\r\n\r\nPeople rave about the pleasures of the country in summer, but I think\r\ncity folks more thoroughly realise the joys of a country home in\r\nwinter. We found something delightfully restful about the crackling log\r\nfire on the open hearth, around which the whole family could gather.\r\nThere is a “hominess” about it that can’t be found by the side of a\r\nsteam radiator. And could any specialist prescribe a better panacea for\r\na business man’s overwrought nerves? There, I am letting my enthusiasm\r\nfor country pleasure interfere with the practical help I set out to\r\ngive. And even now the joys of skating, sleighing and tobogganing have\r\nnot been cited.\r\n\r\nMaking the home comfortable in hot weather is a very simple matter.\r\nA house has four sides--one for each point of the compass--so open\r\nwindows and doors, and catch whatever breeze there is. Wire screens are\r\ncheap; besides, care in not allowing garbage and water to stand around\r\nthe premises will mitigate flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nIf fate or your fancy has settled you in a new place minus old trees to\r\nshade the lawn and porch, wire netting and wild cucumber vines, which\r\ngrow very rapidly, will furnish a substitute. For keeping provisions\r\nI found a well-ventilated cellar better than the best refrigerator. We\r\ntake out the windows and replace them with two thicknesses of flannel,\r\nwhich are thoroughly saturated with water. At noon time on a hot day\r\nevaporation lowers the temperature several degrees, yet the current of\r\nfresh air is not obstructed, as it would be with closed windows.\r\n\r\nWell or spring water is usually refreshingly cool, so an ice house is\r\nreally not imperative, though I recommend building a small one if the\r\nfarm provides good ice, for it is an inexpensive building to construct,\r\nrough boards, sawdust and the ordinary handy man’s labor being the only\r\nrequirements. We did not have one for several years, but then we had a\r\nspring-house with a stone floor and shelves, and a wide gutter running\r\nall around, through which the water from the spring was conducted,\r\nkeeping the place almost icy.\r\n\r\nModern improvements are never to be found in inexpensive country\r\nhouses, so we found that a bathroom or some means of taking an all-over\r\nscrub would have to be constructed immediately. We bought a full-sized\r\ntin bath tub with a wooden bottom for about seven dollars, and placed\r\nit in the little room off the kitchen. A piece of rubber hose was bound\r\ntightly to the escape pipe of the bath tub, and carried through the\r\nwall out into a box drain, thence to a barrel ten feet from the house,\r\nwhich had no bottom, and was sunk into the ground. From there, of\r\ncourse, the water seeped into the subsoil and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe thought it was very fine indeed at first, but later, when our ideas\r\nand finances broadened, we replaced it with a porcelain enameled tub\r\nand wash bowl, with properly soldered waste pipes into a tile-drain\r\nsink three feet deep, to prevent freezing.\r\n\r\nA pump over the kitchen sink had been the only water supply, but as\r\nthat was drawn from a splendid spring several feet above the level of\r\nthe house, we determined, when investing in a new bathroom outfit,\r\nto stretch the purse strings a little further, and put in hot and\r\ncold water. A waterback was attached to the kitchen stove, and a\r\nsixty-three-gallon boiler attached. It cost twenty-two dollars and\r\nseventy-five cents. The bath and basin cost thirty-eight dollars. Fifty\r\nfeet of one-and-one-half-inch pipe, seven dollars and fifty cents. One\r\nhundred feet of half-inch pipe, six dollars. Waste pipe, two dollars.\r\nLabor, twenty-two dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen a spring is not conveniently situated, an automatic ram and a\r\ncistern will have to be used, and I am told that they would cost about\r\nseventy dollars more. Even with the new arrangement of the bathroom,\r\nwe retain the earth closet, which had been bought some time before, at\r\na cost of twenty-five dollars. It stands with its back to the outer\r\nwall, through which a trap-door was cut, to permit the removal and\r\nreplacing of pans and earth. This is undoubtedly the most inexpensive\r\nand sanitary contrivance with which a country house can be furnished.\r\n\r\nThe next comfort was a telephone, which cost only eighteen dollars a\r\nyear, including local calls, long-distance calls, of course, being\r\nextra charges. That, with the rural delivery and daily paper, brings\r\nus stay-at-homes in touch with the great doings of the world and the\r\nlittle interests of our friends.\r\n\r\nWe deserted the city in March, but experience has taught me that the\r\nfall is the best time of the year in which to migrate. There are not so\r\nmany people looking for country places; the days are bright and cool,\r\nthe roads in good condition, and there is much that can be done in\r\nthe garden and orchard to facilitate next spring’s work. By starting\r\npoultry in the fall, one can have broilers ready to catch the early\r\nspring prices. Moreover, it is the early chick that will make a good\r\nlayer the following winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter we will carry the housekeeping into the\r\npoultry yard, for that is the best starting point for a self-supporting\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs poultry was the stepping stone which enabled me to reach the haven\r\nof a self-supporting home, I naturally consider it the best foundation\r\non which a city woman can build her expectations of rural prosperity.\r\nI suppose--and I certainly hope--that every woman won’t have to begin\r\nwith just two or three birds, as I did; but those who may have to,\r\nshould find my first six months’ experience comforting.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one mongrel hens were bought in three detachments, costing\r\nfifty to seventy-five cents each. They were nearly all old ladies\r\nwith strongly developed maternal instincts, who delighted in sitting\r\non eggs and brooding chickens, so we managed to rear one hundred and\r\nforty-eight chickens. We had from three to four eggs a day for the\r\ntable, because we desired to keep only White Wyandotte hens in the\r\nfuture, and eggs for hatching were bought from a near-by farm, and cost\r\naltogether six dollars, feed for six months cost four dollars, making\r\na total outlay of twenty dollars and fifty cents. Ninety chickens were\r\nsold as broilers, realising twenty-two dollars, so the actual cash\r\nprofit was only two dollars.\r\n\r\nBut there was an increase in stock to fifty-eight pullets, all worth\r\nat least one dollar and fifty cents by the end of the sixth month.\r\nBy November 22d they were all laying, the average number of eggs\r\nbeing twenty-five a day, when strictly new-laid eggs were bringing\r\nfrom thirty-five to fifty cents a dozen, a record which I think truly\r\njustifies me in recommending Biddy as the pioneer factor in economical\r\nhome making. Even well-bred, industrious hens must have good conditions\r\nand care to be profitable.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable breeds and varieties of breeds, the most popular\r\nat present being Plymouth Rocks, Barred, Buff, and White Wyandottes,\r\nSilver-Laced, White, Buff, Golden, Partridge, and Black; Rhode Island\r\nReds, which have a plumage somewhat similar to the old-fashioned game\r\nbird, and vary only in having both rose and single combs; Minorcas,\r\nBlack and White; Andalusians, about the shade of a Maltese cat, single\r\ncombs; Leghorns, Black, Brown, Buff, Duck-Winged, Silver, and White.\r\n\r\nPlymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds are very good birds and probably\r\nthe latter would be my selection, if anything could persuade me to\r\ndesert White Wyandottes. The chicks of the three foregoing are all\r\nstrong and easily reared, but the Wyandottes make plump broilers at a\r\nslightly earlier age, maturing perhaps a week or two earlier than the\r\nothers, which are equally good roasters. I do not know that there is\r\nany material difference in their egg-producing capacities.\r\n\r\nLeghorns, Minorcas and Andalusians are much smaller birds and are\r\nconsidered to be the egg machines of the hen family; but observation\r\nhas convinced me that they fall far behind the three heavier breeds\r\nquoted during severely cold weather, when eggs are most valuable. Hence\r\nI always recommend Wyandottes, Rhode Island Reds or Plymouth Rocks for\r\ngeneral utility in the vicinity of New York or further north, and the\r\nLeghorns, Minorcas and Andalusians for the Southern states, especially\r\nwhen eggs are the only consideration, and the birds can have free\r\nrange. One of the great drawbacks to the latter birds is their ability\r\nto fly or climb over fences of almost any height, while the ’Dottes,\r\nRocks and Reds are easily controlled in yards that are not over four\r\nfeet in height.\r\n\r\nWhichever individual fancy or environment decide you in keeping, be\r\nadvised by one who has bought her experience: Don’t attempt more than\r\none breed at a time, and shun a mixed flock of nondescripts, for it\r\nwould tax the perspicacity of a Solomon to feed correctly a tribe of\r\nmongrels.\r\n\r\nOf course, by pure-bred birds I don’t necessarily mean expensive prize\r\nwinners. That would be foolish extravagance. But all large poultry\r\nplants have what are termed “market stock” for sale in the fall--the\r\nprogeny of aristocrats, but lacking some necessary point for show-room\r\nhonours. Such birds can be bought for about a dollar and a quarter\r\neach, and will answer every practical purpose.\r\n\r\nMale birds need not be bought until about three weeks before the\r\neggs are wanted for incubation. Then, if your choice should have been\r\nWyandottes, Plymouth Rocks or Rhode Island Reds, each flock of seven\r\nhens should be headed by a cockerel. Leghorns, Minorcas and Andalusians\r\ncan run fifteen hens to a flock. The male bird should be as good as you\r\ncan afford, for by such means you can gradually improve your stock,\r\nuntil it reaches perfection. It is safer to buy the cockerels from\r\nbreeders far distant from the original home of the hens, to avoid any\r\ndanger of relationship.\r\n\r\nWhenever new birds are bought, segregate them for a few days in some\r\nsmall house and yard, to assure yourself that they are healthy and fit\r\nassociates for your birds. Catch the birds, one by one, each night,\r\nwhile in quarantine. Hold by the feet, the head down, and saturate the\r\nfeathers with some good insect powder from an ordinary flour dredger.\r\n\r\nThe poultry house should be whitewashed about every six weeks in hot\r\nweather, and as late and early in the fall and spring as the weather\r\nwill permit. Scatter dry earth or sand on the platform; clean and\r\nrenew every day. Once a week paint the corners of nests, roosts and\r\nany other fixtures or roughly spliced joints in the building with\r\nkerosene oil and crude carbolic acid, mixed in the proportion of one\r\npint of oil to half an ounce of carbolic. Leaves or whatever scratching\r\nmaterial may be used on the floor should be raked out once a week in\r\nhot weather. All cleanings should be put into a heap under shelter, or\r\ninto barrels, for poultry droppings are invaluable fertilizer for the\r\nvegetable garden.\r\n\r\nDry, cold weather doesn’t hurt the hens at all, but after winter rains\r\nor heavy snow they should be confined to the house, and unless the\r\nweather is exceptionally inclement, all the windows thrown open between\r\n9 A.M. and 2:30 P.M. Very stormy days we keep them open only while the\r\nhens are busy scratching for the noon supply of corn.\r\n\r\nIt is the industrious, busy hen that produces the most eggs, so the\r\nfirst consideration is to keep the flock busy. We promote exercise by\r\nhaving the small yards at the back of the houses repeatedly dug up\r\nduring the spring and summer. In the autumn the dry, falling leaves are\r\ncollected, and used on the floors of the houses during bad weather.\r\nFresh, cold water is kept constantly before them in stone vessels in\r\nsummer, and in a padded-box arrangement in winter.\r\n\r\nBoxes of clean, dry soil are placed in sunny spots in the house, to\r\nencourage the birds to take the dust baths in which they delight. Hens,\r\nhaving no teeth with which to chew their food, are dependent on grit to\r\nperform the office of mastication after the food has passed into the\r\nbird’s gizzard, where a sort of grinding process takes place, which\r\nreduces hard corn to a digestible compound. Being near a stone crusher,\r\nwe buy the fine gravel by the load. Those not so fortunately situated\r\nwill find a specially prepared mixture at any poultry-supply store,\r\nor the small flock can be supplied by smashing broken crockery and\r\nglass into pieces about the size of hemp seed. Oyster shell is a very\r\npoor substitute for grit, its value being the lime it supplies for the\r\nformation of shell.\r\n\r\nFowls are better off kept in yards; in fact, they must be so restrained\r\nif the highest egg records are to be reached. In way back times, it\r\nwas considered a great detriment to yard fowls, but for some years\r\npast professional poultry-keepers have yarded their fowls, because\r\nthey found it was the only way to reach the top notch. Even now the\r\ngeneral farmers still adhere to the free range idea, and I am convinced\r\nthat it is not purely because they think it necessary, but it saves\r\nfeed and other bother. It has been estimated that a flock of common\r\ndunghill hens, such as are seen in the average farm, lay in a year\r\nless than a hundred eggs each. The figures are eighty to ninety.\r\nFarmers who have become breeders, and who thus give the hen decidedly\r\nmore consideration, and still adhere to the free range system, have\r\nincreased this yield to one hundred and fifty and better. Breeders who\r\nhave followed the strictly up-to-date methods, and have yarded their\r\nlayers, have obtained an average of one hundred and seventy-five eggs,\r\nand some have even reached the two hundred mark.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I say fowls or hens, and I do not mean this to include\r\ngrowing chicks. The line must be distinctly drawn between the two. The\r\nrange cannot be too extended for growing stock. What we strive for in\r\ngrowing chicks is frame, on which later we intend to put flesh. This\r\nframe can only be built by food, and plenty of it, converted into\r\nbone and muscle by exercise. After the chick has made the frame, we\r\ncan safely yard her and put on the flesh, and thus convert her into a\r\nmoney-earning machine.\r\n\r\nThe advantages gained by yarding stock are manifold. First of all,\r\nby confining stock to a certain space, we are sure they eat the food\r\nprovided and in the quantity we mean them to have. Feeding layers to\r\nproduce eggs is becoming every year a more delicate operation. Formula\r\nafter formula is tried by different breeders, as an experiment, with\r\nthe hope of increasing the egg yield. If we can force each hen to lay\r\nten a year more, it means a considerable increase of the total of the\r\nflock, and a better return in dollars and cents to the breeder. Yarding\r\nstock is a means toward this end. The food fed is converted, as we\r\nmean it to be, into eggs, and not into muscle. It is decidedly more\r\ntroublesome to care for stock in this way, and necessitates additional\r\nlabour and expense, but we are looking for the increase all the time,\r\nand are thus continually hoping to be compensated for the extra trouble.\r\n\r\nFowls in yards must be supplied with everything they require, which\r\nmeans, all they would naturally seek if running at large. This\r\nincludes, besides the grain we feed by formula, green food, meat,\r\na scratching place and dusting spot, and grit and water. Of all\r\nthese I consider green food the most necessary, and the one thing to\r\nbe impressed upon the mind, because it is the one thing too often\r\nforgotten. Green food of any variety is acceptable. The ideal yarding\r\nof fowls is what is known as double yarding--a house in the middle\r\nand a yard on each side. These yards can be sown with rye or oats,\r\nand alternated so that the fowls will have a constant green run as\r\nlong as the rye or oats will grow, which is until frost. Failing the\r\ndouble yard system, green food may be supplied by lawn clippings, whole\r\ncabbage, clover hay or sprouted oats, fed in a variety of ways. Turning\r\nup the ground of the yards with a cultivator or by shallow ploughing,\r\nwill bring the worms and bugs within reach, or sheep heads cut open and\r\nfed raw can be thrown in, and this is an ideal meat food. Ground beef\r\nscraps may be mixed in mash--and last, and probably the best, cut green\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nYarded fowls need exercise. It must not be understood that because they\r\nare confined they do not get exercise, or as much as if let run at\r\nlarge. The yards should be at least one hundred and fifty feet long,\r\nif they are the width of the average coop, which is ten to twelve\r\nfeet. Some breeds are decidedly more active by nature than others; for\r\ninstance, the Leghorns as compared to the Cochins or Brahmas. This\r\ndoes not affect the health of the fowls particularly. A Leghorn is no\r\nhealthier because of her activity than a Cochin is. It is simply the\r\ndifference in their natures, but because of this excess of activity of\r\none breed over another, the one must have more room than the other. The\r\nLeghorn stands the confinement of a coop ten by twelve feet in winter,\r\nprovided she can be kept actively hunting for her food; but the same\r\nbird would mope and become out of condition if confined too long in an\r\nexhibition coop in a show room. On the other hand, a Cochin, being of\r\na lazier nature, forages slowly, and wanders quietly over her yard,\r\ntakes things easy in the winter coop, and stands the confinement of the\r\nexhibition coop excellently.\r\n\r\nThe foraging nature of any breed can be killed by excessive feeding.\r\nEven birds with free range, if overfed at special meal hours, will\r\ntake but limited exercise, exactly as those treated the same way and\r\nyarded. Exercise is induced by short feeding. In other words, no laying\r\nstrain should be fed all they can eat except at night. Hunger induces\r\nexercise, whether a fowl be let run or yarded. Therefore, fowls fed\r\nshort and induced to hunt for more, will lay eggs, while those overfed,\r\nin the morning especially, will sit around moping in the sun, and\r\nconvert the food into flesh instead of eggs.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of yarded fowls is the certainty of finding all the\r\neggs laid every day, and then being able to guarantee them as strictly\r\nfresh. This is a point of great importance, and constitutes the\r\ndifference between eggs produced by an up-to-date breeder with yarded\r\nfowls, and those sold by the “honest” farmer who collects them wherever\r\nfound, and cannot swear that they were laid to-day, not two weeks ago.\r\n\r\nThe wise poultry keeper will not delay getting things in order for the\r\nbreeding season. New blood is necessary to keep up the vigour of the\r\nflock. Buy the best male bird you can afford. The rooster is more than\r\nhalf the flock. A good bird will grade up young stock next spring.\r\nRemember even if you have pretty good birds of your own rearing, there\r\nis danger in inbreeding for more than one season.\r\n\r\nSelect only the largest, brightest hens for the breeding pens.\r\nReject any which have shown signs of illness at any time of their\r\nlives. The eggs are the main point; only the best layers should be\r\nselected. From seven to twelve birds are enough for one flock. If you\r\nhaven’t the coops, or a long house divided into compartments with\r\naccompanying yards, and can’t divide your birds into small flocks,\r\nadopt the alternating plan. Keep several male birds in a house and yard\r\nseparated from the hens, and let only one run with the hens at a time,\r\nalternating them every day or every week, according to the number of\r\nhens. For example, if I were compelled to keep fifty hens in one flock,\r\nI would keep seven male birds, and let each one in turn run one day\r\nwith the flock, rather than allow three or four birds to remain with\r\nthe flock all the time.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to overhaul things. There is no opportunity when spring\r\ncomes, for then there is always a rush, and you will bring trouble\r\non yourself by using coops which haven’t been properly cleaned, or\r\nwhich have no fastenings, or have broken hinges or leaks in the roof.\r\nThe boys want something to amuse them during the winter evenings;\r\nget them interested in showing off their mechanical skill by making\r\nfeed-hoppers and drinking-fountains. Self-feeding hoppers save a great\r\ndeal of food, especially round brood coops. They prevent the grain\r\nbeing spilled or trampled into the ground or spoiled by thunder showers.\r\n\r\nThe brand of tea which we use in the house comes in square pound tins,\r\nand these we convert into self-feeders by cutting out two inches of\r\nthe front an inch from the bottom, and fitting a sloping false bottom\r\ninside. Any handy boy can look at the picture of a self-feeder in\r\na catalogue, and make one that will be just as serviceable. Pound\r\nbaking powder cans can have a hole the size of a pea cut about an inch\r\nfrom the top, and when filled with water and turned upside down in\r\na two-inch tin pan make capital little drinking-fountains for brood\r\ncoops, and cost only five cents for the dish, so there is no excuse for\r\nnot having plenty of them, and they save chicks getting drowned or the\r\nwater getting defiled, which is usually the case when open dishes are\r\nused. Having all the little things ready and in order counts for a lot\r\nin the spring, when everyone has more work than he can comfortably do.\r\n\r\nAt least two-thirds of the letters I receive are about “mysterious”\r\ncases, nearly all of which are due to the presence of vermin in the\r\nhouses. Most of the women who write seem to be horrified when they find\r\ntheir hens infested by such pests, but my experience has been that it\r\nis the nicely-kept, presumably clean, house and flock which is apt to\r\nbe the worst. Why, is a puzzle, unless it is that women are apt to\r\nkeep their fowls’ home so tidily clean that one never thinks of hidden\r\ntroubles, and for that reason the house and flock are never drastically\r\nattacked, as they should be, with eradicators and preventives. And,\r\nnaturally, the hidden pests multiply undisturbed, and infest the whole\r\nplace before their presence is suspected.\r\n\r\nFew people know that there are any number and variety of pests which\r\nare difficult to discover because of other secretive habits. For\r\ninstance, there is the depluming scab mite, which is a very minute,\r\nvicious pest, that often causes hens to be accused of feather-pulling,\r\nwhen in reality the poor things are only trying to rid themselves of\r\nintruders who cause them positive torture. When a bird is noticed to\r\nhave bare places on neck or back or body it is well to catch it and\r\npull out one of its feathers near the bare spot. Ten to one you will\r\nfind a scaly collection near a quill. Rub it off on to a sheet of\r\npaper, and examine it under a magnifying glass, and you will discover\r\nthat every grain that looked like dandruff is a living mite. Another\r\ntiny atom, which buries itself under the skin of fowls’ legs, causes\r\nitself to be known as “scaly legs.” Many of the mysterious deaths can\r\nbe traced to another variety of the same family which attacks the\r\nair-passages of the bird’s throat, and occasionally reaches the lungs.\r\nThe affected bird gets drowsy, mopes about for a few days, and at last\r\ndies from suffocation, and people wonder what has been the trouble.\r\nThen there are three varieties of fleas, so dark in colour that they\r\nlook almost black, which live in the soil, or in cracks and crevices\r\nof the poultry houses, and sally forth when hungry to feed on the poor\r\ndefenceless hen. One species of these crawls, instead of hopping like\r\nthe ordinary flea, so people frequently make the mistake of thinking\r\nthat it is a plant insect which will not molest poultry. It is all\r\nthese unsuspected visitors which attack poultry at night, rob them of\r\ntheir vitality, and the poultryman of much of his profits.\r\n\r\nLong ago, when I first started my poultry plant, I found a recipe for\r\nliquid louse exterminator and a worm powder published in some magazine\r\nrecommended by Dr. P. T. L. Woods, the great poultry expert. The\r\nliquid is easily made, and very cheap. Dissolve crude naphtha flakes\r\nin kerosene oil. Mothaline and naphtha camphor are two preparations\r\nput up in packages, which can be bought at any drug store, and would\r\ndo as well as the flakes, if you have any difficulty in getting them.\r\nA Boston firm puts up a preparation with aromatic naphthalens and\r\ncamphor, in packages which cost twenty-five cents, and is very good.\r\nOne package dissolved in two gallons of kerosene makes a good mixture\r\nto spray house, nests and roosts. For the birds themselves, paint the\r\ninside of a box with the liquid, and keep a bird in it for from fifteen\r\nto twenty minutes. I had a box made with a compartment one foot square,\r\nso that we could treat six birds at one time. Near the top of each\r\ncompartment there is a hole large enough for the bird to put his head\r\nthrough, and outside we put a trough which is slightly raised from\r\nthe ground, so that the birds can just reach the contents. Fill it\r\nwith small grain, and they keep busy most of the time, which insures\r\ntheir not being smothered, and their necks passing through the hole\r\nprevents the fume of the wash escaping too rapidly. Of course, someone\r\nmust remain and watch the birds all the time; otherwise there is the\r\ndanger of the bird pulling its head in and being suffocated. To be sure\r\nthat the bird is perfectly clean, fumigation should be repeated three\r\ntimes, with an interval of three days after each. If houses are kept\r\nclean and all new birds are thoroughly fumigated before they are turned\r\ninto the flock, it will not be necessary to attack the whole flock more\r\nthan once or twice a year. Nests for setting hens are always swabbed\r\nout with the mixture, and brood coops get a dose once a week. As soon\r\nas any hen shows signs of getting broody, she is dredged with powder,\r\nwhich is well rubbed down into the “fluff” of the feathers; then on the\r\ntenth and nineteenth days she is again well powdered, and from the time\r\nthe chicks are a week old she receives a dose of powder once a week as\r\nlong as she broods them. The recipe for the insect powder is as follows:\r\n\r\nTo one peck of freshly slaked lime add half an ounce of carbolic\r\nacid. Mix very thoroughly, and add same quantity, in bulk, of tobacco\r\ndust. Another powder recommended by Dr. Woods in the same article,\r\nand which I have used very frequently, is made by mixing equal parts\r\nof finely-sifted coal ashes and tobacco dust, then moisten the whole\r\nwith the liquid louse exterminator. Allow it to dry and it is ready for\r\nuse. When purchasing carbolic acid, ask for ninety per cent. strength,\r\notherwise they are very likely to give you a much weaker preparation,\r\nfit only for medical use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITTING HEN AND THE INCUBATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back over the memories of my farm initiation, it seems as if I\r\nhad not fully realised the possibilities of my new undertaking until\r\nthe first incubator was inaugurated. As I have already told you, I\r\ndid all the first year’s hatch under hens, and still set every hen\r\nthat evinces any desire to assume the cares of motherhood, because it\r\nseems Nature’s plan to keep the egg machine in good working order.\r\nIf a broody hen is not allowed to sit, it takes several days of\r\nincarceration to break up her desire, then several days more after she\r\nis freed before she commences to lay, and invariably the sitting fever\r\nwill attack her again within a few weeks. Now, incubation takes only\r\nthree weeks; brooding of chicks, another four or six weeks, and Mrs.\r\nBiddy has had a complete rest, followed by vigorous exercise while\r\nscratching for her babies. So when she is returned to the yard she is\r\nin perfect condition to produce eggs. Let Biddy sit whenever she wants\r\nto, but don’t wait her pleasure in the early spring, for you might have\r\nno young chickens to sell when they bring good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION OF THE INCUBATOR\r\n\r\nThere are a great many incubators on the market, some heated by hot\r\nair, others by hot water. If you select any one of the standard makes\r\nadvertised you will get a good, practical hatcher. Printed instructions\r\nfor setting up and running are sent out with every machine, but they\r\ndon’t emphasise all the important points quite strongly enough for\r\namateurs. Lots of people can’t drive a screw home accurately, and fail\r\nto realise that if the head is slightly to the right or left it throws\r\nthe fixture which is being attached to the machine out of plumb, and\r\na hair’s breadth makes a difference when such delicate appliances as\r\nthermostatic rods (the power which controls the heat), are concerned.\r\nA blunder supplies much knowledge. I should never have realised the\r\nnecessity for absolute exactness if one of the screws used in attaching\r\nthe lamp support to our second incubator had not gone slightly awry. It\r\ncaused the chimney almost to touch one side of the socket into which it\r\nfits. That, in turn, drew the flame to one side, and caused it to smoke\r\nat night when turned up for extra heat. It was a very little blunder,\r\napparently, but it almost spoiled the incubator, and quite spoiled the\r\nhatch.\r\n\r\nTo be sure that the incubator fixtures are plumb, use a spirit level,\r\nthe only safe guide. After starting the machine, practise running it\r\nfor a few days before putting in the eggs. When the heat reaches one\r\nhundred and two and one-half degrees, with the escape dial hanging the\r\nwidth of a match from the opening, put in the trays, which, being cold,\r\nwill lower the heat, and should close the dial until the trays become\r\nwarm, and the thermometer in the machine again registers one hundred\r\nand two and one-half, when the dial should once more be dangling the\r\nmatch width above the opening. Should the closing and opening not take\r\nplace as the heat varies, the machine is not properly adjusted, and you\r\nmust practise until it will bear the test before putting in the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe thermometers are supposed to have been tested before they are\r\nshipped, but it is well to buy an extra one and compare them; or get\r\nyour doctor, who is sure to have an accurate thermometer, to do it for\r\nyou. The egg tester comes with the incubator. It is a tin, funnel-like\r\nchimney that fits over the lamp, and has a projecting opening, bordered\r\nwith black, before which to hold the eggs. The first test should be\r\nmade on the seventh day; the second on the fifteenth day. Hold the egg,\r\nlarge end uppermost, in front of the opening. If it looks perfectly\r\nclear it is infertile and can be used to feed young chicks. If it\r\nshows a dark-red spot with spidery legs it is fertile, and must be\r\nreturned to the incubator. Dead germs are rarely discernible at the\r\nfirst testing, except to the expert eye. By the fifteenth, the veriest\r\namateur will be able to detect them.\r\n\r\nSuccessful incubation depends principally on being able to maintain\r\nthe amount of heat and moisture necessary at the different stages of\r\ndevelopment. A thermometer is furnished with most incubators, but as\r\nyet hygrometers are not, so it is advisable to buy one. For as they\r\nonly cost $1.50 each, it would be pennywise and pound-foolish to do\r\nwithout one. Having these two little instruments to tell exactly the\r\namount of heat and moisture present in the machine, simplifies the\r\nwork wonderfully.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like to have the thermometer register 102 degrees, and\r\nthe hygrometer 75, when I first put the eggs in the incubator. The\r\nsecond week, the heat is increased to 102½, and the moisture lowered to\r\n70 degrees. The third week, heat from 102½ to 103; moisture not over 45\r\nuntil the nineteenth day, when the moisture is again increased to 55 or\r\n60 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe reason for such fluctuation in the moisture may need some\r\nexplanation. During the first stages of incubation it is necessary to\r\nprevent the escape of the water which is part of the egg, as it is\r\nneeded to keep the albumen in the right condition for the development\r\nof the germ. After the tenth day, when the embryo is formed, the water\r\nshould be gradually allowed to evaporate, so that the amount of air\r\ninside the shell increases, as it is needed to aid the circulation of\r\nthe blood and permit the growth of the chick. Increasing the moisture\r\nagain on the nineteenth day is simply done to soften the inside skin of\r\nthe egg and make it easy for the chick to break through.\r\n\r\nWhen extra moisture is to be supplied, place a pan of wet sand or a\r\ndamp sponge in the bottom of the incubator. If the machine is standing\r\nin a very damp cellar, the difficulty is often to keep down the\r\nmoisture rather than to increase it.\r\n\r\nIn this case, keep the trays out of the machine for a greater length\r\nof time when you turn the eggs each day, and open the ventilators.\r\nProbably the safest and simplest way to learn how to gauge this\r\nimportant point of moisture, is to set a hen at the same time that you\r\nstart the incubator, and then compare the development of the air-cell\r\nin the egg every few days. If the development is too slow, open the\r\nventilators at the side of the incubator wider, and air the eggs a\r\nlittle longer each day when you have the trays out to turn the eggs.\r\nReverse affairs if the development is too quick. It is better to run\r\nthe machine a degree or two above the given temperature than below it,\r\nespecially during the last few days.\r\n\r\nAfter the morning of the twentieth day don’t open the incubator until\r\nthe hatch is over, or until late on the twenty-second day, and don’t\r\nget nervous if the temperature runs to one hundred and four or even to\r\none hundred and five; it is caused by the animal heat of the chicks,\r\nand will do them no harm. Turning down the lamp slightly will of course\r\nreduce the heat; but be very careful not to let it run below one\r\nhundred and three during the last twenty-four hours. Low temperature\r\nprolongs the hatch, weakens the chickens and makes them susceptible to\r\nall sorts of ailments.\r\n\r\nIndividual outdoor brooders I think are the best, for in very cold\r\nweather they can stand in a light outhouse. I used to monopolise the\r\nsummer kitchen from February to April, and then have them placed out\r\nin the orchard. Placing an outdoor brooder under cover is really only\r\nfor the convenience of the attendant, for they are storm proof. If you\r\ncommence with an incubator that holds one hundred and twenty to one\r\nhundred and sixty eggs you will require two brooders, and if in a\r\ncold or Northern locality, some small house which can be warmed during\r\nvery cold weather, if you propose commencing to incubate in January.\r\nA brooder supposed to hold one hundred chickens will accommodate that\r\nnumber comfortably for about nine days, after which not more than\r\nfifty should be kept in it. Hence the necessity for two brooders.\r\nWhen the chicks are six weeks old in cold weather, and four weeks\r\nold in moderate weather, they can be removed to the small house (the\r\ntemperature of which should be kept at sixty degrees during the night).\r\nRemember, incubation takes only twenty-one days, so you must allow at\r\nleast three weeks to elapse before starting the incubator a second time.\r\n\r\nGive the brooder a good coat of whitewash inside before using it. Cover\r\nthe drum which furnishes the heat under the hover with two or three\r\nthicknesses of flannel, to make it soft for the little bodies to cuddle\r\nup against. Cover the floor of the hover compartment with a piece of\r\nold carpet or felt, and the outside compartment with sweepings from\r\nthe haymow. Have the heat running steadily at ninety-five degrees for\r\nseveral hours before the chicks are to be put into it, and keep it at\r\nthat heat the first seven or eight days. Then gradually let it fall to\r\nseventy-five degrees. Of course, I mean the heat under the hover. The\r\nrest of the brooder will be--and should be--several degrees lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF THE CHICKS IN THE BROODER\r\n\r\nKeep fresh water in vessels into which the chicks can get only their\r\nbills in the outer compartment. Never neglect seeing that they are all\r\nsafely cuddled up to the heat at dusk.\r\n\r\nDuring the bright, sunny hours in the middle of the day let the chicks\r\nhave plenty of fresh air in the playroom; at feeding time, when they\r\nare all busy, give the hover compartment a thorough airing.\r\n\r\nWhen Biddy is doing the brooding, remember she is pretty sure to need\r\ndusting with some good insect powder. The nest box she sat in should\r\nhave been cleaned, and a handful of camphor balls scattered under the\r\nhay of the nest. Moreover, each hen should be dusted before setting,\r\ntwice during the twenty-one days, three days after the hatch is out,\r\nand each week so long as she broods the chicks.\r\n\r\nFresh air, warmth and good food prevent many troubles almost impossible\r\nto cure if once contracted; so look to the little things.\r\n\r\nThirty hours must be allowed for the proper digestion and assimilation\r\nof the yolk, which is absorbed into the abdomen immediately before the\r\nchick breaks through the shell. When Biddy has done the hatching do not\r\nmove her to the brood coop for twenty-four hours, unless she is flighty\r\nand keeps getting off the nest, in which case it is better to keep the\r\nchicks in a covered box by the kitchen stove until some more motherly\r\nhen can be persuaded to adopt them. Always try to set two or three\r\nhens at the same time. Good hens that are well fed and have not been\r\nbothered with vermin seldom give any trouble about the last twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DIVERSIFY THE DAILY RATION\r\n\r\nNow about the all-important question of feeding: For the first two or\r\nthree days get ten pounds of rape and millet seed, pin-head oatmeal and\r\ncracked corn, charcoal, and fine, sharp grit. Mix all together. If you\r\ncannot get pin-head oatmeal, buy hulled oats and break them up fine.\r\nThe grain must also be cracked quite fine; in fact, it is safer to put\r\nthe mixture through a sieve which will allow nothing larger than millet\r\nto go through. Then there is no danger of chicks being choked. Feed the\r\nmixture by scattering among the sweepings, to encourage the chicks to\r\nscratch and take exercise.\r\n\r\nMorning and evening make a mash by chopping a hard-boiled egg, shell\r\nand all, green onion tops or sprouts. Mix with stale bread crumbs, and\r\nfeed on a flat pie plate or strip of wood. After the chicks are two\r\nweeks old the oats and corn need not be quite so fine--more the size of\r\nhemp seed, which can be added to the mixture; so can cracked wheat or\r\nbarley, and the mash can be made of ground corn and oats, with onions\r\nand scalded liver, chopped, three times a week (about a small cupful to\r\na quart of mash).\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by scalded liver is liver dropped into a kettle of boiling\r\nwater and let boil up once. Leave to cool in the water. Quite raw it\r\nis too strong for little chicks. For a change I mix the grain with\r\nscalding milk two or three times a week. Never make more at a time than\r\nwill be fed within the next few hours, as it sours.\r\n\r\nPot cheese is a favourite dish with all poultry, and very wholesome. If\r\nthere is any tendency to bowel trouble, give them rice water in place\r\nof the drinking water.\r\n\r\nKeep brooders and brood coops clean and dry. The grass around the coops\r\nshould be kept cut loose, so that the chicks can run about easily.\r\nSee that every coop is closed at night, and do not let the chicks out\r\nwhile the grass is dewy. Don’t give the hens too many chicks to brood\r\nin winter, for if she cannot keep them close to her they will die of\r\nchill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING EARLY BROILERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA distinct branch of the poultry business, and one that is extremely\r\nprofitable for those who can run it successfully, is raising young\r\nchicks in the winter for early broilers. To commence on a large scale\r\nrequires as large capital, but there are hundreds of men and women who\r\nhave accommodations on their premises that would enable them to start\r\nin a small way, and by investing the profits from the first year they\r\ncould obtain a really good equipment for the business.\r\n\r\nOf course, the real starting-point should be a good flock of healthy\r\nhens, all of one breed, preferably Wyandottes or Rocks, for really\r\nthe hen who lays the egg has as much to do with the success in\r\nbroiler-making as the care one may bestow on the business.\r\n\r\nNext in importance is a well-constructed new incubator. Don’t be\r\ntempted to buy a second-hand machine, which has usually been allowed to\r\nstand in a damp cellar or in some outside shed while not in use, for\r\nit will in all probability warp or go to pieces when put in commission\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBrooders come third on the list, but are quite as important as the\r\ntwo foregoing, for there is no use hatching a chick unless it can be\r\nreared, and the heat and ventilation of the artificial mother is more\r\nthan half the battle.\r\n\r\nThe up-to-date broiler plant consists of an incubator-cellar,\r\na nursery, or brooder-house, as it is usually called, and a\r\nbroiler-house. Both the latter are divided into small pens, about two\r\nfeet wide and five feet long. In the nursery-house, the top ends of the\r\npens are inclosed like boxes to the depth of about a foot and a half,\r\nand have hot-water pipes running through them to furnish heat for the\r\nchicks to brood under. A flannel curtain cut into strips falls from the\r\ntop of the inclosed part to divide it from the rest of the pen, which\r\nruns down to the outer wall of the house, where a large window lets\r\nin light and sun. The pens should have board floors slightly elevated\r\nabove the main floor, to avoid dampness, and the divisions are made\r\nwith a foot board about nine inches high, and one inch netting two feet\r\nhigh above that. The brooder-house is divided in the same way, but the\r\nhot-water pipes only run around the walls of the house, as the birds\r\ndon’t need the immediate heat to brood under, after they leave the\r\nnursery, when they are five or six weeks old.\r\n\r\nBut, until you can afford the proper equipment, one or two incubators\r\ncan be run in the cellar of the house or an unused room where there is\r\nno other heat. Individual brooders can be used in place of the nursery\r\nand brooder-house, if you have any light outbuilding to stand them in.\r\nIn fact, I like the individual brooders better for the nursery period\r\nthan the pipe-house system, because it is only necessary to heat as\r\nmany as are needed, and with the pipe system the entire house has to be\r\nheated, even if you are only going to use one section.\r\n\r\nMost of the different makes of brooders on the market are made with\r\ntwo compartments: A chamber with a round hover, which is heated with a\r\nlamp, and an outer compartment for exercise and feeding. The average\r\nprice is nine dollars, and the machines are supposed to hold one\r\nhundred chickens, but seventy-five are quite enough; and even that\r\nnumber should be decreased to fifty the second week, and twenty-five\r\nthe fourth week--that is, if the chicks are to be confined entirely\r\nto the brooder. But if it stands in a warm room, where a small outer\r\ninclosure can be made on the floor of the house for a playroom, fifty\r\nchicks can be carried through to the squab-broiler age in one brooder.\r\n\r\nChicks hatched specially for the broiler trade have to be steadily\r\npushed along; plump, juicy meat being the main object. The first\r\nrequisite is warmth. Have the compartment in which the hover is\r\nsituated heated up to ninety-eight degrees before the chicks are put in\r\nand keep it so for the first three days and nights. Keep the door in\r\nthe outer compartment shut for the same length of time. On the fourth\r\nday it can be opened and the chicks allowed to run into it, but the\r\nroom in which the brooder stands should be warm, and the little ones\r\nshould be watched toward bedtime, for they are apt to remain in the\r\nouter compartment and become chilled.\r\n\r\nBeing chilled even for a short time is fatal to young chicks, for if it\r\ndoes not kill outright, it causes bowel trouble and gives them a bad\r\nsetback which will surely delay the day of marketing, if nothing worse.\r\nAfter they are three weeks old, the door in the outer compartment can\r\nbe opened, so that they can run out on to the floor of the room. Let\r\nthem have plenty of scratching material. If the weather is fine and\r\nmild, it will do them good to let them have an outside run for an hour\r\nor two in the middle of the day, but don’t be in a hurry to harden them\r\nbefore they are five weeks old, for it is a risky experiment.\r\n\r\nWyandotte chickens when hatched will weigh two ounces. If all goes well\r\nthey should gain two ounces during the first ten days; four ounces for\r\nthe third week; another two ounces in the fourth week, and at the end\r\nof the eighth week they should weigh two pounds.\r\n\r\nThe entire life of a chicken intended for a broiler is so artificial\r\nthat few if any of the rules for raising ordinary chicks can be applied\r\nto them. The great aim is to develop them as quickly as possible, for,\r\nto get the best price, a broiler must grow quickly and be plump.\r\n\r\nLike all newly-hatched birds, they must have nothing to eat for the\r\nfirst thirty-six hours. After that commercial chick-feed (which is a\r\nmixture of all sorts of small seeds and cracked grains) should be\r\ntheir sole diet for ten days.\r\n\r\nWhen there are only small quantities of chicks to feed, and cash is\r\nof more value than time, it will be cheaper to mix the feed at home.\r\nTake one quart each of finely-cracked corn, bran and hulled oats; mix\r\nwith the same quantity of golden millet, rape, Kafir-corn and very\r\nsharp, fine gravel, crushed charcoal and finely-chopped clover-hay.\r\nMix thoroughly, then pass through a fine sieve, to insure there being\r\nno large pieces of the corn or oats for the babies to choke themselves\r\nwith. For the three days they are confined to the hover department,\r\nput a small pan filled with the mixture in each corner and, instead of\r\nwater, fill a small drinking-fountain with milk which has been scalded\r\nand allowed to cool. Leave it with them for ten or fifteen minutes, at\r\nmorning, noon and again at about 3:00 P. M. It must not be allowed to\r\nremain all the time, because the heat from the hover will turn it sour.\r\n\r\nAfter they are allowed access to the outer compartment, mixed grain\r\nshould be scattered on the cut hay (or whatever is used to cover the\r\nfloor) so that the chicks will have to scratch which compels them to\r\ntake enough exercise for healthy growth. The plan is to feed little and\r\noften. The milk can be allowed to stand in the outer compartment, but\r\nthe fountain must be thoroughly cleansed and scalded every day.\r\n\r\nAfter the tenth day, the door of the outer compartment can be opened\r\nand the chicks given further liberty, if there is a stove in the\r\nbuilding to warm the atmosphere; but if there is not, don’t let them\r\nout of the brooder until they are four weeks old. In either case\r\ntheir diet must be slightly changed after the tenth day. Steam some\r\nof the chopped clover-hay--about a quart--and add one pint of coarse\r\ncorn-meal, one pint of ground oats and half a small cupful of chopped\r\nliver which has been boiled for five minutes (raw liver is too strong\r\nfor such young birds, but it should not be boiled more than the five\r\nminutes). Feed once a day at noon. Put the mash into two or three\r\ndishes, so they can all get a chance to eat at once. Remove any that\r\nis left at the end of ten minutes. If it is not possible to get fresh\r\nliver, use one teaspoonful of beef-meal or any of the commercial meat\r\npreparations which are ground fine. Continue to scatter the dry grains\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\nWhen they are four weeks old, give mash twice a day about 9:00 A. M.\r\nand 2:00 P. M., increasing the allowance of meat slightly; and if you\r\nhave plenty of skim-milk, make cottage cheese and give it to them as an\r\nextra once or twice a week. From the fourth week keep a pan containing\r\ngrit and charcoal always before them. After they are six weeks old\r\nincrease the quantity of corn-meal in the mash, and correspondingly\r\ndecrease the ground oats, until all corn-meal and no oats are being\r\nused. Also, stop steaming the clover and mix it dry with the other\r\ningredients; then moisten the mash in scalded milk in which suet has\r\nbeen boiled (one pound of chopped suet to four quarts of milk). Boil\r\nfor fifteen minutes. Feed it three times a day--9:00 A. M., 12:00 M.\r\nand 3:00 P. M. The last two weeks before killing, omit all the dry\r\ngrain; feed nothing but mash, made as before, only as soft as possible\r\nwithout being sloppy. Feed four times a day all they will eat in ten\r\nminutes, but on no account leave food before them longer than that,\r\nor they will become satiated. Birds pushed along should be in fine\r\ncondition for market when from ten to twelve weeks old.\r\n\r\nOur broilers are never given water to drink, but always scalded milk.\r\nScalded milk invariably checks any tendency toward bowel trouble and is\r\nalso a strong factor in making the flesh tender and juicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POULTRY-YARD IN MID-SEASON\r\n\r\n\r\nBaby chicks are so pretty, and appeal so strongly to the sentimental\r\nfeeling most people have for infant things, that they are invariably\r\nwell cared for until they are deposed by new arrivals, or reach the\r\nhalf-fledged, long-legged period of gawky ugliness. Then they are\r\nalmost surely neglected, especially by the amateur, who does not\r\nrealise that the intermediate stages are of paramount importance. It is\r\na waste of time and money to hatch chicks and feed hens heavily in the\r\nwinter, if they are allowed to reach a standstill period during growth.\r\n\r\nWhen chicks are eight weeks old, they should be separated from their\r\nmothers, and the families divided; the young pullets being relegated\r\nto colony coops, in an orchard or partly shaded meadow, where they\r\nwill have extensive free range; the cockerels being placed in the\r\nsemi-confinement of yards, as their ultimate fate is the frying-pan,\r\nwhich necessitates plump bodies, while free range would only develop\r\nframe and muscle.\r\n\r\nOur colony houses are six feet long, three feet wide, thirty-six\r\ninches high in front, and twenty-four inches at the back. They are\r\nmade of light scantling; the ends, back and roof being covered with\r\nroofing-paper, and the front, to within eight inches of the ground,\r\nwith unbleached muslin, which insures perfect ventilation and prevents\r\nrain beating in upon the birds when they are on the roosts, which are\r\nfixed a foot from the bottom and nine inches from the back of the coop.\r\nTwo holes are made, nine inches apart, in the middle of each end of the\r\ncoop, and a heavy rope knotted through them, to form handles.\r\n\r\nThe coops having no flooring, and the whole construction being light,\r\nthey are easily moved to fresh ground each week, and so kept clean with\r\nlittle trouble, an important item when there is a large quantity being\r\nused. Having a large orchard, we placed the coops in rows thirty feet\r\napart, as two sides of the orchard adjoin woodland, through which a\r\nnever-failing spring-stream runs, so the birds have a splendid range.\r\n\r\nTwenty birds are placed in each coop. The first week a portable\r\nyard, five feet long, is placed in front of each coop so that the\r\nyoung chicks cannot wander off and get lost, as they surely would\r\nin strange quarters. During that time a self-feeding hopper and a\r\ndrinking-fountain are placed inside of the coop. When the yard is\r\nremoved, the individual vessels are dispensed with, large drinking-tubs\r\nand feed-hoppers being stationed midway between every four coops, to\r\nreduce time and labour in caring for the birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POULTRY YARD]\r\n\r\nThe large hoppers are nothing more than boxes, five feet long, two feet\r\nwide and six inches deep, over which is placed an A-shaped cover, made\r\nof slats, one inch apart, to prevent the birds getting into the box\r\nand scratching the grain onto the ground, where it will be wasted. For\r\nwater, five-gallon kegs are used, with an automatic escape, which keeps\r\na small pan continually full. Both feed and water are placed under a\r\nrough shelter, to protect them from sun and rain. Using such large\r\nreceptacles, it is only necessary to fill them every other day.\r\n\r\nFeed consists of a dry mash, composed of ten pounds of wheat bran,\r\nten pounds of ground oats, one pound of white middlings, one pound of\r\nold-process oil-meal and ten pounds of beef scraps, all well mixed. In\r\naddition to that, they receive at night a feed of wheat and cracked\r\ncorn--two parts of the former to one of the latter. About half a pint\r\nis scattered in front of each coop, at about four P. M.\r\n\r\nGrit is supplied in large quantities. Being near a stone-crusher,\r\nwe buy the screenings by the cart-load and dump it in heaps on the\r\noutskirts of the orchard, where it does not show, but is quite\r\naccessible to the chicks.\r\n\r\nOn these rations, without any variation, the pullets are kept until\r\nSeptember, when they are transferred to their winter quarters--houses\r\ntwelve feet wide, ten feet high in front, sloping to eight feet at\r\nthe back. Each house is divided by wire netting into twelve-foot\r\ncompartments, in each of which forty birds are kept.\r\n\r\nWinter feeding commences as soon as the birds are settled in their\r\nhouses, and consists of the same mash as when on range, except that\r\nten pounds of corn-meal is added, and, instead of the ten pounds of\r\ncommercial beef scraps, sixteen pounds of freshly cracked green bone is\r\nused, and, in place of being before them all the time, it is fed once a\r\nday, just what they will eat up clean in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nUntil three years ago, we used to moisten the mash and feed at eight\r\no’clock in the morning. Now we feed it dry, at 2 P. M.; at night,\r\nwheat, cracked and whole corn, scattered over cut straw, which covers\r\nthe floor of the house. The proportions are three pounds of whole\r\ncorn, one pound of wheat and two pounds of cracked corn. The birds are\r\nalways eager for the whole corn, and, as they run about to pick it up,\r\nthe cracked corn and wheat get shaken down into the litter, so they\r\nrarely get any but the whole corn at night, which fills up their crops\r\nand keeps them warm until morning, when the fine grain induces them\r\nto scratch--vigorous exercise, which sets their blood circulating and\r\nkeeps them busy until 8 A. M., when the drinking-fountains are filled\r\nup with hot water.\r\n\r\nFor green food we use Swiss chard, cabbage and rape until frost\r\ndestroys the supply, after which we resort to clover hay, chopped\r\nand steamed. It is fed at about 11 A. M., a large panful to each\r\ncompartment, and at the same time a pint of wheat and cracked oats is\r\nscattered on the floor. Sharp grit and oyster-shells are always before\r\nthem, and in very cold weather the drinking-fountains are filled up\r\nagain with hot water at eleven and three o’clock.\r\n\r\nIf you have no orchard, or other partly shady place for coops, it\r\nwill be necessary to erect some sort of shelters for the birds to rest\r\nunder during the heat of the day. Any sort of material or shape will\r\ndo, so long as protection from the sun is afforded. If free range is\r\nquite impossible (as it often is for suburban poultry-keepers), the\r\nbirds must be given as large yards as possible and supplied with lots\r\nof scratching material, over which small grain must be scattered two\r\nor three times a day. Fresh green bone will be better than the beef\r\nscraps. Vegetable food is most imperative under such circumstances. Sow\r\na large patch of Swiss chard; it is a true cut-and-come-again crop.\r\nOats and rape are also useful crops for poultry-keepers who can give\r\ntheir birds free range through the summer.\r\n\r\nA word of warning: If you are reduced to cutting grass, or use\r\nlawn-clippings, be careful to have them cut into short lengths of not\r\nmore than an inch, otherwise the birds may become crop-bound.\r\n\r\nThe cockerels which go into the market-pen are fattened and sold as\r\nquickly as possible, except the few we keep for stock, and these are\r\ngiven large yards and fed in the same manner as pullets on range.\r\n\r\nFor fattening birds, use ground corn and oats in equal parts, add half\r\na part of charcoal and moisten with skim-milk. Give plenty of green\r\nfood and sharp grit. Feed little and often. All expedition must be used\r\nin the matter of marketing, for every day’s delay after they reach the\r\ndesired weight is a dead loss.\r\n\r\nConstant culling and marketing is one of the great secrets of success.\r\nCulling must be observed just as rigidly when selecting winter stock.\r\nDiscard any faulty birds. There are always some in every flock, even\r\nif the parent birds have been blue-ribbon specimens: Crooked tails\r\nor feet, ear-lobes which are red instead of white, or white instead\r\nof red, according to the variety you may be keeping. Wyandottes,\r\nOrpingtons, Plymouth Rocks, Brahmas or Cochins should all have\r\nbright-red ear-lobes. Leghorns, Minorcas and Andalusians should be pure\r\nwhite. It is a bright, energetic-looking pullet which makes the best\r\nlayer, and it is not profitable to keep any but the best layers, so put\r\nthem into small pens and fatten. The young roosters bring good prices\r\nin the fall, and their absence from the farm reduces feed-bills and\r\nprevents crowding in the house, which is always disastrous.\r\n\r\nDo not delay, after September first, in getting the pullets into their\r\nwinter quarters, for it is most important that they become accustomed\r\nto their new surroundings and reconciled to the change from free range\r\nto semi-inactivity. It often takes five or six weeks for them to become\r\naccustomed to the new conditions, and, unless they have time to adjust\r\nthemselves, they won’t start laying until cold weather sets in, which\r\nmeans that the egg-crop is likely to be unprofitably delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY IN THE POULTRY-YARD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange that few people except the real poultry-farmers realise\r\nthat July is one of the most important months in the year. The desire\r\nto have eggs in zero weather invariably compels good attention to the\r\nhens during the winter. Baby chicks arouse interest in the spring, but\r\nas the weather gets warmer, eggs are plentiful, and the pretty, fluffy\r\nbabies developed into long, lanky creatures, who seem nothing but a\r\nnuisance specially ordained to destroy the garden, so the poor things\r\nare shut up in small quarters and woefully neglected. During the fall\r\nand winter I am repeatedly asked how to make pullets and hens lay, but\r\nI can rarely suggest a remedy, because nine times out of ten it is the\r\nresult of blunders made during the preceding summer.\r\n\r\nI don’t believe in sacrificing the garden to the chickens, but I do\r\nthink they should be properly controlled. A roll of two-inch-mesh\r\nwire netting five feet high costs only about four dollars. At the\r\nprice of eggs nowadays a few dozen will pay for it. Posts can be cut\r\nin the wood-lot on most farms, so a yard for a good-sized flock can\r\neasily be made for less than five dollars. The best plan is to run a\r\ndivision fence down the centre, so the birds can be confined in one\r\nhalf alternately, for by such means a supply of green food can be kept\r\ngrowing until frost. The ground should be ploughed, and seeded to rye\r\nor oats, before the wire is put up. If poultry is to be profitable,\r\nthe old and young stock must be kept apart, because it is impossible\r\nto feed correctly when they are all together. Young birds need plenty\r\nof nutritious food to push them along quickly, and laying hens must\r\nbe put on special rations to bring about early molting, which is the\r\nfoundation of a good winter supply of eggs.\r\n\r\nAbout July 5th commence to cut down the feed gradually, until at the\r\nend of two weeks forty hens are having only a pint of oats and a pint\r\nof wheat mixed, night and morning. Scatter it amongst cut straw or\r\nsome litter, so they will have to scratch for every grain. The first\r\nof August commence to increase the rations, and keep it up for a week,\r\nso that by the fifteenth they are getting two quarts of mash in the\r\nmorning, a quart of meat scraps and a pint of cracked corn at noon and\r\nwheat and oats or barley at night. Give them just about all they will\r\neat up clean in fifteen minutes. The morning mash should be composed of\r\ntwo parts ground feed (corn and oats), one part white middlings and one\r\npart oil-meal, mixed with scalding milk or water. The semi-starvation\r\nfollowed by the heavy feed forces the moulting season and allows plenty\r\nof time to feather out and get into condition before October, when\r\ntheir rations should be made up of the essentials for egg-production,\r\nwhich are clover hay, bran, wheat, corn and animal food.\r\n\r\nYou see, it takes about three months for hens to get rid of their old\r\nfeathers and put on a new coat, and if the process is not forced in\r\nsome way, they will not commence before August, which would make it\r\nOctober before they finished. Of course that would be time enough if\r\nit happened to be a warm, late fall, but if cold winter weather sets\r\nin, as it often does in November, hens would not lay before spring, as\r\nmoulting leaves them in a more or less debilitated condition.\r\n\r\nLots of people make the mistake of selling off hens as soon as they\r\ncease laying at this season, which means that they are usually parting\r\nwith the birds that would make the real winter layers. Hens that lay\r\nthrough the summer, and do not cease until the fall, will be idle and\r\nunprofitable in the winter. It is the general disregard of the moulting\r\nperiod which causes so many failures in the winter supply of eggs. The\r\nrule should be to sell off all the hens that have been laying steadily\r\nthrough the summer and commenced to shed feathers in September. Growing\r\nfeathers is a trying ordeal, and the consequence is that when the hen\r\nbegins to moult she ceases to lay, for she cannot produce eggs and\r\nfeathers at the same time.\r\n\r\nFeathers are composed largely of nitrogen and mineral matter. That is\r\nwhy the food at moulting time has to be so very nutritious. To feed\r\nnothing but corn at such a time is simply waste, as the hen cannot\r\nproduce new feathers from such a diet. If she is on free range she\r\nwould have a better chance of gathering the necessary material,\r\nbut even then, if the feathering process is delayed too long, the\r\nhen becomes exhausted, and is susceptible to cold and all sorts of\r\ndiseases. This is the real reason why roup and swelled head are so\r\nprevalent in the fall.\r\n\r\nYoung birds hatched out in April or thereabouts usually commence to lay\r\nin November, because they have not been subject to the drain upon the\r\nconstitution caused by moulting. But chickens that have been hatched in\r\nFebruary or early March are very liable to moult late in the fall, just\r\nwhen they should be commencing to lay. For this reason it is as well to\r\nmarket all the first-hatched chickens, and hold over those hatched late\r\nin March or through April, to increase the laying flock.\r\n\r\nCull all young stock down closely. Don’t keep a lot of young cockerels\r\nto eat up the profits during the winter. Even pullets which are at all\r\nbackward should be marketed, for they won’t develop after cold weather\r\nsets in, and it does not pay to keep them through for summer layers.\r\nMost of the failures made in the poultry business are due to people not\r\nhaving the courage to clean out non-productive birds. Just calculate\r\nhow many quarts of feed ten growing birds will eat in seven months, and\r\nI think you will be convinced that it is unfair to expect the flock to\r\nsupport them and still show a profit. The trouble is that people don’t\r\nrealise that young stock stand still as soon as cold weather starts,\r\nremaining almost stationary until spring. Another evil of keeping\r\nundeveloped stock is that they occupy house-room and crowd the older\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to wage war on vermin, while the bright days last; turn\r\nthe hens out and have a good housecleaning. Use plenty of hot limewash\r\nto which kerosene and crude carbolic acid have been added. If you have\r\ntwo houses, crowd all the birds into one for a few days, and when the\r\nempty house has been thoroughly cleaned, commence to catch the birds\r\nat night, and powder thoroughly. Use Dalmatian or the home made powder\r\nin an ordinary tin flour-dredger, and after shaking a good supply into\r\nthe feathers, use your hands to rub it well into the fluffy parts near\r\nthe skin. It is well to repeat the dose about three days after. In thus\r\ndoing house and birds at the same time, you may be reasonably sure of\r\nhaving exterminated the pests for a few months, at least. Remember to\r\nrake up all the falling leaves, to be used for scratching material. A\r\nbagful scattered on the floor of the chicken-house once or twice a week\r\nwill increase the egg-yield and keep the birds healthy during enforced\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nBefore I forget it, let me remind you not to feed new corn to the\r\nfowls. Every year, about this season, I get quantities of letters\r\ntelling of good, fat hens, the picture of health, which have been\r\nfound dead. Acute indigestion, brought on by eating unseasoned corn,\r\nis the cause. So be careful. If your last year’s supply has run out,\r\nit is better to buy a few bags than lose hens on whom you depend for\r\nwinter eggs. Store all the cabbage or other green vegetables you can\r\nbefore it is too late. Look the house over and stop up all cracks and\r\ncrevices. A draft from a small hole may give one bird a cold which may\r\ndevelop into roup and infect the whole flock, though an open-front\r\nhouse with only muslin screens may be healthy.\r\n\r\nAbout open-front houses, I don’t believe in them for laying stock. If\r\nI were going to carry a lot of young birds or hens which will not lay\r\nuntil April, I might adopt the open-front house as a matter of economy,\r\nbut not otherwise. I can’t see what is gained by them--that is, in\r\ncold latitudes. In the South they are probably all right. We all know\r\nthat the great percentage of food supplied during cold weather goes\r\nto keep up bodily warmth, and that if we expect eggs in zero weather\r\nwe must supply the hens with sufficient provisions to nourish the\r\nbody, generate heat and allow a surplus to be converted into eggs.\r\nBy providing tight, warm sleeping-quarters, we save some of the food\r\nwhich would be used for warmth in a cold house. Plenty of fresh air I\r\ndo believe in, but everything likes to be warm during the still, dark\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nI have often seen the argument used that wild birds, which have no\r\nhouses at all, are always healthy. But how often do we hear about\r\nnumbers of birds being found dead after a severe storm. What is more,\r\nwild birds only lay during the spring of the year. When man upsets\r\nNature’s laws to supply human wants, he should stop quoting Nature’s\r\nways. Our present-day hen, which lays, or is expected to lay, one\r\nhundred and eighty to two hundred eggs a year, is a very different\r\ncreature from the wild hen, and she must be provided with better food,\r\nhousing and care.\r\n\r\nAs of course you know, different food materials contain different\r\nqualities. Some give us the fat necessary for warmth; others,\r\nnitrogenous qualities, which form flesh; still others, minerals, such\r\nas lime, soda, etc., etc., needed for bone and muscle. All kinds of\r\nanimals, birds, and even human beings, require some quantity of these\r\ningredients, otherwise one part of the body or nervous system will be\r\nstarved, while another will be overfed. With the hen it is of great\r\nimportance that she have all these different ingredients well blended\r\nin her food, as she requires them not only to sustain her in health,\r\nbut also for the formation of eggs.\r\n\r\nWe will start with the foods that give the greatest quantity of lime,\r\nbecause it is needed for shell, and some fractional part in the white\r\nand yolk, most essential, for it is turned during incubation into\r\nbone, the very foundation of the chicken. Clover hay, linseed-meal\r\nand wheat bran contain about six pounds of lime in every hundred, and\r\nturnip-tops, carrots and all grasses have a goodly percentage. Flesh\r\ncomes from nitrogenous or albumenal foods, first of which are beef,\r\nlinseed-meal, middlings, bran, clover hay, wheat and skimmed milk.\r\nFat and heat we get from carbonaceous provenders, among which corn\r\nand buckwheat lead, closely followed by oats, wheat, rye, clover hay,\r\nlinseed-meal and unskimmed milk.\r\n\r\nMineral matter--lime, soda, potash, magnesia and sulphur--is\r\nprincipally formed by the action of digestion reducing the matter\r\ncontaining these ingredients to ash. The usual troubles assailing\r\npoultry on most farms come from the feeding of only one of these\r\nelements. Poor Biddy has all flesh and no warmth, or all fat and no\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nKill a bird that has been fed on corn only, and it will be heavy with\r\nlayers of internal fat, but showing a very poor depth of breast-meat.\r\nBalancing rations, trying to equalise flesh, fat (warmth) and mineral,\r\nis not a very hard proposition when the values of even a few grains and\r\nplants are realised.\r\n\r\nHaving read so far, you will now realise that clover hay, linseed-meal,\r\nbran, wheat, oats, beef scraps and unskimmed milk contain practically\r\nall the equivalents of summer foods; the addition, therefore, of corn,\r\nbuckwheat or rye in cold weather is safe and simple if given only as\r\nwarmth-makers. Never allow the proportion to exceed what is needed for\r\nthat purpose, or fat will be made and stored, neutralising all your\r\ncare. In other words, the hen fed on corn only, in order to accumulate\r\nthe ten parts of flesh and twenty parts of fat needed for the egg, will\r\nbe compelled to acquire fifty parts more fat than she requires.\r\n\r\nGreen bone and water now alone remain for consideration. The former is\r\nbeyond doubt the best of egg foods, qualifying as it does in nearly\r\nall the needed elements. Many farmers scoff at the idea of having to\r\npay for a mill to cut up bone for chickens, yet the same men will not\r\ngrudge a hay-cutter for the horse and cow. Green bone means fresh bone\r\nfrom the butcher, which can be bought for about two cents a pound. The\r\nmill to grind it ranges from eight to fifteen dollars.\r\n\r\nGreen bone contains the natural meat, juices, blood, gristle, oil\r\nand mineral matter in soluble condition, which renders it easy of\r\ndigestion, especially for birds--almost all the components for eggs\r\n(white, yolk and shell), in the most concentrated form possible. So,\r\nif eggs are to become profitable, the bone-mill must be kept going.\r\nWhen it is impossible to obtain the green or fresh bone, the ground\r\nbone sold especially for poultry can be used, though it is not half so\r\nsatisfactory, because the drying process it has to submit to before\r\ngrinding leaves little but the phosphate of lime and earthy matter,\r\nwhich clover and bran furnish in better form. At least half the egg\r\nis composed of water, surely a sufficient reason for impressing the\r\nimportance of a generous supply accessible at all times, in clean\r\ndishes, of a proper temperature, cool in summer and the chill off in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FLOCK OF TURKEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are six varieties of turkeys: Bronze, White Holland, Bourbon\r\nReds, black, buff, slate and Narragansett. But the three first are the\r\nones most worth raising specially for market, as they are large birds\r\nand the most popular varieties. So it is easy to get good stock, to\r\nstart with, which is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nA trio of any one of the three varieties will cost from fifteen to\r\ntwenty dollars, and if only twenty birds are reared the first year for\r\nmarket, they will bring at least sixty dollars. That is placing the\r\naverage weight at twelve pounds and price twenty-five cents a pound.\r\nThis is, however, absurd, when you consider that young toms weigh\r\ntwenty pounds and pullets fifteen, feed could not possibly cost more\r\nthan ten dollars, which would leave thirty dollars’ profit the first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA successful turkey-raiser told me he had kept his birds in yards for\r\ntwelve years, so I felt safe in adopting the plan. I suppose I ought\r\nto have said inclosures, for they covered about half an acre each.\r\nThe land was shaly, with a rocky background, but there were plenty of\r\nclumps of scrub brush and ferns, from the rocks to the top of the two\r\nacres they used. The ground sloped to the south; a spot of no earthly\r\ngood for any other purpose, but perfectly ideal for turkeys.\r\n\r\nHowever, as our farm had no such place, I utilised a strip of poor\r\nbrush land which had good natural drainage and made three inclosures,\r\neach one hundred feet wide and three hundred feet long. An open-front\r\nshed twelve feet long and ten feet wide was built in each. They were\r\njust rough shelters built out of slabs and the only fittings were\r\nperches made out of sassafras poles, none of them less than nine inches\r\nin circumference. This is one of the important items in fixing a place\r\nfor turkeys. Being heavy, large-footed birds, they are uncomfortable\r\nand positively suffer if condemned to balance themselves on slight\r\nperches such as chickens use.\r\n\r\nIt took four loads of slabs to make the three sheds, and they cost\r\nseventy-five cents a load at the sawmill. Wire netting cost forty-eight\r\ndollars, perches and posts were cut in our own woods, and the home help\r\ndid the work.\r\n\r\nI got ten female birds from the Massachusetts farm for fifty dollars\r\nand two toms from Long Island for twenty dollars. We sent for the birds\r\nearly in December so that they should have time to get thoroughly\r\nat home in their new quarters before the laying season. Before they\r\narrived, the front of the sheds was covered with wire netting, so that\r\nwe could keep them shut up at first, but after two or three weeks it\r\nwas removed and they were allowed the range of the yards. The wire\r\naround the inclosure was only four feet high and one wing of each bird\r\nwas cut to prevent them flying over it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLOCK OF TURKEYS]\r\n\r\nEarly in March a half-barrel was secreted among the brush, in both\r\nthe occupied yards, so that the hens would be accustomed to their\r\nappearance and, we hoped, consider safe hiding-places for their\r\neggs. The plan answered splendidly. About the middle of the month we\r\ncommenced to keep a lookout for eggs in the half-barrel and for stolen\r\nnests. When an egg was found, it was purloined, and a china one put in\r\nits place; ditto when the second egg was taken, but after that, no more\r\nchina eggs were dropped, for two always seemed to satisfy Mrs. Turkey.\r\n\r\nUnlike common hens, turkeys are not attracted to a nest by an egg. In\r\nfact, they retain so much of the wild bird that they will not adopt\r\na nest that has been used by any other bird, so never distribute\r\nnest-eggs as decoys, but only as substitutes for those abstracted.\r\n\r\nThe matter of feeding the old birds is of great importance and is the\r\nrock most farmers founder on. Too often the birds are left to forage\r\nfor themselves or, at the best, are given uncertain quantities of\r\ncorn, which means that they are miserably thin and dilapidated or\r\noutrageously fat. In either case they lack the components which the egg\r\nfor hatching should possess. Result, weak youngsters which are doomed\r\nto die, no matter how much care is lavished on them.\r\n\r\nI once heard an old poultryman say that the care of the chick must\r\ncommence when its mother is hatched. This may seem ambiguous to the\r\namateur, but it is literally a fact and one which my Massachusetts\r\nfriend had made me understand was most potent when applied to turkeys.\r\nSo our turkeys are fed with special reference to supplying the\r\ningredients to be converted into bone and vigour in the birds to be.\r\nBreakfast: Chopped clover-hay, steamed overnight, two quarts; corn and\r\noats ground together, one quart; beef-scraps, half a pint. At noon, one\r\nquart of oats, Kafir-corn or barley scattered broadcast in the yards.\r\nAt night, whole corn when the weather is very cold, but as it moderates\r\nin the spring the amount is decreased and wheat is used in its place.\r\n\r\nThese are their regular rations from December to April, when the\r\nbeef-scraps and corn are entirely omitted. Water and grit is before\r\nthem all the time. We buy screenings from the stone-crusher and, as it\r\nis cheap, dump a lot into each yard twice a year.\r\n\r\nI generally steal the first ten eggs from each nest and set them under\r\nthe hens. However many a turkey lays after that, she is allowed to keep\r\nand hatch them. It takes them twenty-nine days to hatch, and large,\r\nmotherly old hens should be chosen from the chicken-house to do the\r\nincubating. It is not safe to put more than five such eggs under an\r\nordinary hen.\r\n\r\nWhen the hatch is over, put the hen into a brood-coop and, in front of\r\nit, put a box about nine inches deep and large enough to form a yard\r\nfor the babies to exercise in. It is, of course, necessary to remove\r\npart or the whole of the end of the box which joins the front of the\r\ncoop, so that the little ones can run in and out. Cover the bottom\r\nof the box with coarse sand and put a small drinking-fountain in one\r\ncorner. Thus the babies will have a safe place to play in the first\r\nfew days of infancy, when they must be kept dry. After that the box\r\ncan be removed and the coop moved a few feet every day for the sake of\r\ncleanliness.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Turkey’s brood hatches, we treat them in the same way, only\r\nthe brood-coop is specially made and is much larger than the ordinary\r\nhen-coop. The first feed the babies have is stale home-made bread\r\nsoaked in scalded milk, which is squeezed out of it before it is fed.\r\nLike little chicks, they must have nothing for twenty-four hours, then\r\nlittle and often must be the rule.\r\n\r\nNever leave food in front of little turkeys, for they are very apt\r\nto overeat. After two weeks they need only be fed four times a day;\r\nafter the fourth week three times a day. After the first two days add\r\na little hard-boiled egg which has been chopped fine, without removing\r\nthe shell, and a few days later, pin-head oatmeal and ground charcoal;\r\nabout a teaspoonful of the latter to a cupful of bread and oatmeal.\r\n\r\nBy the end of two weeks gradually reduce the bread and increase the\r\noatmeal, which should be cooked about half an hour and allowed to dry\r\nout, so it is easily crumbled when cool.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth week, ordinary ground oats, just moistened with\r\nscalding milk, may be used. Half-boiled liver, chopped fine, is the\r\nbest animal food to give. When that is not practicable, use the best\r\nbrand of commercial ground beef, one teaspoonful to a quart of meal,\r\nbecause it is very strong and liable to produce diarrhea, a disease\r\nwhich attacks young turkeys almost sooner than any other young bird.\r\nWatch carefully and at the first evidence of any looseness of the\r\nbowels give boiled rice to eat and rice-water or cold tea to drink.\r\n\r\nWatch newly-hatched babies for a few days at feed-time, for there\r\nis often one or more that needs to be taught how to eat. This is\r\nespecially so when they are with common hens. But a little patience\r\nin crumbling close in front of them and coaxing them to pick it up\r\nwill overcome the difficulty. After they are eight weeks old we take\r\nthem from the hens and put them into the third yard, which is kept\r\nexclusively for young stock.\r\n\r\nAt night they are driven into the shed, the front of which is always\r\nkept covered with wire netting, so that they can be closed in until\r\nthey get accustomed to roosting. Of course, the perches in this shed\r\nare put nearer the ground and are much smaller than those intended for\r\ngrown birds. About October 1st they are allowed the free range of the\r\nfarm and are fed on corn at night and given all the milk they will\r\ndrink, to get them into good killing condition before Thanksgiving,\r\nwhen they are all sold off, except perhaps a few extra good ones, which\r\nwe may keep for stock. The old birds are also allowed free range from\r\nOctober until February, but they are fed in the yards at night and are\r\nshut in so that they don’t form any bad wandering habits.\r\n\r\nIn buying stock, be generous and get the very best, from some\r\nwell-known turkey-raiser. Ordinary farm stock is so apt to be inbred\r\nthat, although the birds may look all right, it is not safe to buy them\r\nfor breeding purposes, as a want of stamina will surely show in the\r\nyoungsters.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason it is best to get the hen-birds from one place and\r\nthe toms from another. If you are going to keep Bourbon Reds or bronze,\r\nit is advisable to buy half-wild toms. These are the result of crossing\r\nwild gobblers with domestic hens, which is done by large breeders to\r\ninfuse new blood and keep up the vigour of their stock. Personally, I\r\nlike the White Holland turkey best, as they are domesticated and bear\r\nconfinement well.\r\n\r\nIf you are only going to keep a few birds, say a trio or five hens and\r\na gobbler, large yards are not necessary, but a shed over which netting\r\ncan be put, should always be set apart for their use, so that they can\r\nbe fed and shut up at night. Never, under any circumstances, keep any\r\nof the pullets you raise, unless you change your gobbler. Don’t let two\r\ngobblers run with the flock at the same time. If you want to increase\r\nyour number of birds, you must either put up inclosures or alternate\r\nthe gobblers every two days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCKS AND GEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nDucks are so profitable that I cannot understand why so few keep them,\r\nunless it is the mistaken idea that they must have a stream or pond in\r\nwhich to swim. It is true that the old-fashioned puddle duck did seem\r\na miserable creature out of water, but the improved strains are almost\r\nas much land birds as chickens are. My stock started with two ducks\r\nand a drake which had cost me seven dollars. The first season I raised\r\nfifty-eight, sold forty-six, and kept twelve to stock. They were ready\r\nfor market when eleven weeks old, and the lowest price was eighteen\r\ncents a pound.\r\n\r\nDucks must have dry, comfortable quarters, but a splendid house for\r\ntwenty ducks can be made on any farm for a dollar, or even less. One\r\nman who keeps large flocks makes duck houses with hurdles of green\r\nboughs for walls and roof, the outside padded with leaves, straw, corn\r\nstalks or cedar boughs. Each house is six feet by four feet and two and\r\none half feet high, and accommodates seven ducks and a drake.\r\n\r\nDry-goods boxes, costing ten cents at any village store, can be made\r\ncomfortable for a small flock. The main point is to keep them dry,\r\nwhich depends almost more on the care given to the covering of the\r\nfloor than the wall of the house. Good, dry bedding, changed at least\r\ntwice a week, will keep them warm and happy through the coldest weather.\r\n\r\nDucks’ eggs bring good prices during February and March. You can easily\r\nget them to laying by then, as it depends principally on feeding.\r\nDucks, like geese or cattle, must have a good percentage of bulk\r\nmaterial and green stuff, as well as concentrated grain feed. Clover\r\nhay, or even mixed hay, chopped and steamed, about half a pailful with\r\na pint of coarsely ground corn-meal and the same of bran mixed through\r\nit, is about right. If hay is short, chop corn stalks small, and steam.\r\nChopped vegetables of all kinds are good, but pumpkins, potatoes and\r\nbeets are fattening; so, unless the weather is very cold, omit the corn\r\nwhen they are fed, using more bran or screenings in its place.\r\n\r\nIn the summer have the children gather plantain, dock, groundsel or any\r\nother non-poisonous weeds. Have sugar barrels ready, and pack in the\r\nweeds while fresh. Get a heavy, solid board rounded off to fit inside\r\nthe barrel, put on top of the green stuff, and weight down with heavy\r\nstones. Pad up tight with paper, sawdust, straw or any loose material,\r\nand replace the head of the barrel. When snow covers the ground, such\r\nfood will increase the eggs from both ducks and chickens.\r\n\r\nOak leaves, acorns and pig hickories do not take long to gather in the\r\nfall, and will tone up the appetites of pigs, chickens and ducks late\r\nin January, when they are getting tired of grain feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUCKS AND GEESE]\r\n\r\nImperial Pekin, Rouen and Indian Runners have been the best market\r\nbreeds of ducks for some years past, and are still splendid fellows,\r\nboth for eggs and table, and their new rivals, the Buff Orpington\r\nducks, quite equal them as utility birds.\r\n\r\nDucks make such bad mothers that it is better to hatch their eggs under\r\nhens or in incubators. The first few eggs a duck lays each season are\r\nseldom fertile. Eleven are a full sitting, and it requires twenty-eight\r\ndays for their hatching. Examine the nest every two or three days after\r\nsetting the hen, for bad eggs. A weak germ that dies causes the egg to\r\ndecompose, and the odour once smelled can never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nExamine the nest when the hen comes off to feed, and take away the\r\neggs that are dark and mottled. If you fancy an egg looks wrong, pick\r\nit up and smell it; that and its sticky touch assure you, for the egg\r\nis porous. If you have been using an incubator to hatch chicks you can\r\ntest with a proper tester, and this must be done all the time from the\r\nfourth to the fifteenth day.\r\n\r\nWhen the hatch is over at the end of the twenty-eighth day, have ready\r\na box about a foot deep and three feet long, the top out and one end\r\ntaken off. Place the open end against the coop door, so making a little\r\nrun, with a board floor covered with an inch of dry sand or earth. Baby\r\nducks need even more protection from damp than chicks; therefore, if\r\nthe weather is bad, keep the coop and run under cover, and if fine,\r\nthe shade of a tree is necessary, for the little fellows can’t stand\r\nthe full sun. After a week the hen can be removed, but keep them within\r\nbounds on short grass, not letting them out until the dew is gone.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-four hours feed nothing. First week: Half a pint of rolled\r\noats, some cracker or stale bread crumbs, two hard-boiled eggs chopped\r\nfine, half a cupful of coarse sand just moistened with milk. Feed four\r\ntimes a day just what they will eat in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nSecond and third weeks: Half a pound of ground oats, the same of wheat\r\nbran, one-fourth of a pint of corn-meal, the same of coarse sand, two\r\ntablespoonfuls of beef meal, a pint of finely cut green clover, rye or\r\ncabbage moistened with scalded milk. They must be fed four times a day.\r\n\r\nFourth to sixth week: Boil a quart of hulled oats for an hour, add a\r\npint of corn-meal, wheat bran, half a pint of fine grit, the same of\r\nbeef scraps and a quart of clover or any kind of green food. Feed four\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nSixth to tenth week: One quart of corn-meal, a pint of wheat bran, a\r\npint of boiled oats, a pint of beef scraps, half a pint of grit, a\r\ntablespoonful of charcoal and a pint of clover. Feed three times a day.\r\n\r\nThey should be ready to kill the eleventh week.\r\n\r\nDo not let the ducks, young or old, get frightened if you can possibly\r\nhelp it. They are nervous things. No matter what you feed, if they are\r\nfrightened or made to run daily, they will not fatten. If you go about\r\nthem gently they are the easiest things to drive any distance, for\r\nwhere one goes, all follow; hurry them and they will scatter, and it is\r\ngood-bye to them for hours.\r\n\r\nThe feed for those to be kept for stock is the same up to three weeks\r\nold, but from that on one quart of ground feed, one quart of bran,\r\nhalf a pint of grit and half a pint of beef scraps. Mix moist with\r\nmilk, water, sour milk or buttermilk, and feed night and morning. If\r\non a free range this is all they want. If not, you must add clover or\r\nvegetables, and feed three times a day. Remember always to have fresh,\r\nclean water before them.\r\n\r\nWhen ducks are ten or eleven weeks old they should be in condition for\r\nmarket. Early green ducks should weigh not more than four and one-half\r\npounds, while later ducks cannot be too heavy. As a rule early ducks\r\nmature very unevenly, making it necessary to sort them over often.\r\n\r\nDucks are fit to dress for only a short time. They “go back,” as it is\r\ntermed, for they shed and grow a new lot of feathers, which takes all\r\nthe fat and all your profit. Hence the importance of turning them into\r\nmoney as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn dressing it is most desirable to dry pick. Although some still\r\nscald, dry-picked stock sells better than scalded, especially when the\r\nmarket is dull, for it can be frozen, while scalded stock cannot. For\r\ndry picking have a box for the feathers. It may be of any size you wish\r\non the ground, and should be of such depth that the top edge is one\r\nor two inches lower than your knee when in a sitting position. To use\r\nfor cooling the ducks, saw a coal-oil barrel in two; use one-half for\r\ncooling, the other half for clear water to put them in after washing.\r\n\r\nTo kill, catch the feet in the left hand, and the neck near the breast\r\nwith the right hand, then with a swinging motion (the same as in using\r\nan axe), strike the back of the head against a post with sufficient\r\nforce to start the blood from the ears. Now with a quick motion place\r\nthe body under your left arm, catching the back of the head and the top\r\nof the bill in the left hand. Using a knife with a five-inch blade,\r\nmake a cut crosswise at the base of the brain, then turn the edge to\r\nthe roof of the mouth, and slash outward, being careful not to split\r\nthe bill. Let the blood run for two seconds.\r\n\r\nSit down. Place your knees against the neck just tight enough to keep\r\nit in place. If too much pressure is put on, it will stop the flow of\r\nblood and give the flesh a red appearance. Hold the feet and wings in\r\nthe left hand. Commence picking at the vent, then the breast and neck.\r\nThe feathers are left on half the neck, and on the wings from the first\r\njoint out. Pick clean as you go, for once the duck gets cold, it will\r\nbe hard to pick. Experts use a shoemaker’s knife ground thin, and strop\r\nit the same as a razor, to shave the pin and small feathers off.\r\n\r\nAfter picking, put them into ice water or cold spring water until the\r\nanimal heat is gone; then wash the feet, and wash all clots of blood\r\nfrom the mouth and throat; then put into another vessel of water, which\r\ntakes all the stains off and gives a nice clean appearance. After they\r\nare clean you can put them into a barrel or box with crushed ice, and\r\nif left for twelve to twenty-four hours in this condition they can be\r\nshipped a long distance with but little ice. To make dressed ducks show\r\nup good it is necessary to take them out of clean water at the finish.\r\nThe second vessel should have clean water put in as soon as it gets\r\ncloudy.\r\n\r\nWhen packing for shipment, use flour or sugar barrels. Pack with back\r\ndown, putting the head under the wing. Pack close, and leave a space on\r\ntop for ice. Raise the top hoop, place burlap on top, drive the hoop on\r\nagain, with the burlap under, and nail firmly. Before using, the barrel\r\nshould be thoroughly washed. Bore two three-fourths-inch holes in the\r\nbottom, to drain.\r\n\r\nA goose will lay from ten to twenty eggs and then want to sit; but if\r\nyou coop her in sight of her companions, four or five days will suffice\r\nto break her up. If she lays a third clutch of eggs, let her keep them\r\nand sit.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is mild, set five eggs under a hen; or, if she is\r\nvery large, seven might be risked. It takes from twenty-eight to\r\nthirty days for goose eggs to hatch. As the skin is very tough, it is\r\nwell to sprinkle a little water around the nest, and even on the eggs\r\nthemselves, during the last two weeks, especially if the weather is\r\ndry and hens are doing the incubating.\r\n\r\nThe youngsters need nothing for the first thirty-six hours. Then feed\r\nscalded corn-meal--the coarsest kind--and wheat bran, chopped green\r\nclover or young green oats cut fine, tops of green onions, lettuce\r\nleaves or any tender young greens.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is fine, put the coop containing Biddy and her family\r\nout on the grass, making a small yard in front for the first few days,\r\nto prevent their wandering too far away. Move the coop and yard to a\r\nnew place as they eat the grass. Like young ducks, their drinking water\r\nmust be in a vessel that permits them to put the whole beak into the\r\nwater, or they are apt to get the air passages clogged up with soft\r\nfood, causing the gosling to smother; but on no account must they be\r\npermitted to get their bodies into the water, as they chill and cramp\r\nso easily.\r\n\r\nIt is much better to buy two- or three-year-old birds from a reliable\r\ndealer for stock than obtain eggs for setting and wait for them to\r\ndevelop. After the breeding season is over, geese and goslings need\r\nlittle grain if on grass land. Late in the fall geese do well if turned\r\ninto the corn stubble or the orchard, where they will clean up all the\r\nwindfalls--which does much to stamp out grubs and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGEONS AND SQUABS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen pigeons are kept for squab-raising it is one of the most\r\nprofitable ventures in which suburbanites or real country folks can\r\nembark. The young are ready for market when four weeks old; the average\r\nwholesale price is three dollars a dozen. Private customers will pay\r\nforty cents a pair all through the winter months, and a good pair of\r\nmature birds will raise two squabs every four weeks for nine months in\r\nthe year, which means that each old pair of birds should provide one\r\nand one-half dozen squabs, which will market for four dollars and fifty\r\ncents. The cost of keep is supposed to be fifty cents a year, but ever\r\nallowing one dollar a year, there should be three dollars and fifty\r\ncents clear profit.\r\n\r\nThese estimates are made on good homer pigeons, well housed and cared\r\nfor, not common nondescript birds, leading a half-wild existence, with\r\nonly old-fashioned shelter behind a row of holes high up in the barn,\r\nwhere the nests are exposed to every storm; besides which, the young\r\nof mongrel pigeons only weigh five or six ounces when four weeks old,\r\nand are so scrawny and unappetising that they are difficult to market\r\nat any price, whilst homers at the same age weigh from twelve to twenty\r\nounces, and are white-skinned and plump. The mature homers will cost\r\nabout two dollars a pair from any of the recognised lofts, but it is\r\nno use buying elsewhere, for unless birds are mated pairs, you may\r\nhave another season wasted. Pigeons are faithful creatures and remain\r\nin pairs for years, and if an accident happens to one of them will\r\nfrequently refuse to mate a second time the same season. Young birds\r\nwhich are only paired at the time of sale are likely to object to the\r\nmates chosen for them, and proceed to exercise personal choice when\r\nliberated amid a flock of strange birds. So be wise and buy only from\r\nreliable experienced breeders.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient house for squab-raising is built like a\r\nchicken-coop, about twelve feet wide, eight feet high in front, sloping\r\nto six feet at the back, and any length, according to the number of\r\nbirds kept. Have plenty of windows in front of the house, and openings\r\nsix inches square, three feet apart, all along the back of the house\r\nabout a foot from the roof. Run a nine-inch board the entire length\r\nof the house as a platform for the birds to alight on as they go in\r\nand out, and it is just as well to have a similar board just under the\r\nholes on the inside of the house. Put up three or four perches near the\r\nfront windows, so that the birds can fly from side to side of the house\r\non wet days for exercise.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds which can be kept in each house can be easiest\r\nestimated by the nests. Each pair of brooders must be provided with\r\nnest-boxes divided into two compartments twelve inches square. They\r\ncan be arranged in tiers all along the side, back and front walls, and\r\nfrom floor to ceiling. Put the first tier about eighteen inches above\r\nthe floor, as the birds don’t seem to like the lower nests. Fasten\r\nsmall perches about a foot long to the partition on each box, for the\r\nconvenience of the birds as they fly back and forth, and when feeding\r\ntheir young.\r\n\r\nBefore the house is occupied, it should be thoroughly whitewashed, the\r\nfloor covered with sand or ground plaster, and earthenware dishes known\r\nas “nappies,” which cost one dollar a dozen, must be put in, one into\r\neach compartment. Suspend a bundle of cut hay in one corner of the\r\nhouse, as some birds like to make their own nests, though others seem\r\nto think that a handful of tobacco-stems, which it is well to place in\r\neach nappy as a check to vermin, is quite nest enough.\r\n\r\nDrinking-fountains and feeding-boxes into which the birds can only get\r\ntheir beaks are imperative for pigeons, for they are most particular\r\nand will not take defiled food or drink unless positively starved into\r\nit. Yet if they have open feed and water boxes, they will scatter the\r\ncontents all over the floor. There is a galvanised-iron feeding-box\r\ncosting one dollar on the market which has seven openings, so that many\r\nbirds can feed at the same time. Water-fountains of the same material\r\nare virtually indestructible, and cost only fifty cents.\r\n\r\nThe yard and fly must of course be entirely closed for pigeons, and\r\nshould be four feet higher than the front of the house, so that the\r\nbirds can use the roof for a sun-parlour. We use four-by-four joists,\r\ncut into twelve-foot lengths, for the front of the house, as they can\r\nbe nailed to the house and need not be sunk into the ground, as those\r\nat the side and far end must be. The joists for the sides and end are\r\ncut into thirteen-and-one-half-foot lengths, which allows a foot and\r\na half to go into the ground. These measurements allow the use of\r\nfour-foot netting without any waste. For a house twelve feet long, I\r\nthink the yard should be at least fifty feet. Erect several perches\r\nat the far end of the yard, a platform about two feet wide and four\r\nfeet long on legs three feet high in the centre of the yard for the\r\nbath-tubs to stand on. Pigeons must have a bath, for cleanliness is a\r\nnecessity; a pan about two feet square and four inches deep is the best\r\nsize, and they can be bought in galvanised iron for one dollar each.\r\n\r\nRed-wheat, Kafir-corn, cracked corn, Canadian field-peas, German\r\nmillet and hemp-seed are all appropriate for pigeons. They should be\r\nalternated, or one or two mixed together. Of course, sometimes one\r\ngrain is cheaper than another, or easier to get in certain districts,\r\nbut don’t use any one grain exclusively. Pigeons must have variety.\r\n\r\nWe follow the rations recommended by W. E. Rice, a very experienced\r\npigeon-raiser. Morning: Equal parts of cracked corn, Kafir-corn and\r\nwheat. Evening: Cracked corn and Canadian peas. These regular meals are\r\nput into the feed-boxes in quantity sufficient to insure the birds\r\nhaving a constant supply. Treats which we feed at odd times, such as\r\nmillet, hemp and rice, are thrown on the ground, for, as they are only\r\nfed in comparatively small quantities, they are eaten up at once, and\r\nso there is no danger of their being soiled. Remember always to buy\r\nred, not white, wheat, for the latter is very apt to cause diarrhea.\r\n\r\nOnce a week we give them a meal of stale bread which has been\r\nsteeped in skim-milk and squeezed almost dry again, for we have lots\r\nof skim-milk, and the bread we get from a baker in the town for\r\ntwenty-five cents a barrel. Freight costs another twenty-five cents,\r\nbut even at fifty cents a barrel we find it an economical feed when\r\nthere are a lot of squabs to be fattened for the market.\r\n\r\nThe parent birds take all the trouble and responsibility of feeding and\r\nraising the young right up to the time they are ready for market. The\r\nhen-bird lays two eggs, with one day intervening, which take eighteen\r\ndays to incubate. After the eggs are hatched, both birds devote their\r\nentire energies to feeding the youngsters for about two weeks, for\r\nboth have the power to secrete the predigested substance often called\r\npigeon’s milk, on which nestlings are exclusively fed for the first few\r\ndays. At the end of two weeks the hen has usually laid two more eggs in\r\nthe second nest, so that by the time the squabs in the first nest are\r\nready for market, the second eggs are ready to hatch. It is this double\r\nfamily which necessitates two nests for each pair of birds.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is even more imperative in the pigeon-house than in the\r\nhen-house. Never neglect to scald out the earthenware nest, and\r\nwhitewash the compartment it stands in, every time squabs are removed\r\nfor market, for it is only by such rigid system that the place can\r\nbe kept in a sanitary condition. Pigeons must have shell, salt\r\nand charcoal to be healthy, so there should be a self-feeder with\r\nthree compartments in each house. When ordering, specify that the\r\noyster-shell is for pigeons, as it is to be broken up smaller than for\r\nthe hens. The rock salt and charcoal should be ground to about the\r\nsize of rice. During the heavy breeding season we crush most of the\r\ngrain, and always peas, for when the parent birds are rushed for time\r\nbetween their two nests they are very liable to pick up whole grain and\r\nfeed to the young birds before they are able to digest it. Until we\r\ndiscovered this carelessness, we often had a dead squab in the nest.\r\nThe feed-boxes can be kept filled up, as pigeons never overeat, and\r\nmust have access to food at all times when they have young ones to feed.\r\n\r\nIf you start with a few pairs of birds, the best way to increase the\r\nnumber is to sell the squabs, and use the money to buy mature birds,\r\nfor it takes pigeons six months to reach maturity, and it is necessary\r\nto have two extra houses in which to keep the growing birds, as they\r\nshould not be allowed to remain in the regular brood-pen. If, however,\r\nyou have specially-mated birds and desire to raise their progeny, you\r\nmust watch the nests, and as soon as the young ones get out on the\r\nfloor (the old ones generally push them out when the eggs in the second\r\nnest hatch), they can fend for themselves, and should be removed to a\r\nnursery-house, where all feed must be cracked to the size of rice for\r\nseveral weeks. When one desires to build up size and good points, it is\r\nnecessary to have two nursery-houses, and so be in a position to select\r\nthe best birds from different parentage to mate.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: The nestlings from one side of the house should go\r\ninto Nursery No. 1, nestlings from the other side into Nursery No. 2.\r\nOur nurseries are only seven by ten feet, so we never have more than\r\ntwenty birds in each, and they can be taken within a few days of each\r\nother, in this way making very little difference in age when it comes\r\nto mating-time. When the younger ones in the nurseries are between six\r\nand seven months old, we take a bird from each and put them into a\r\nmating-cage, which is really a coop, four feet long, two and one-half\r\nfeet deep and two feet high, which is fastened up in a corner of the\r\nfeed-house. The coop is divided into two compartments by a wire-netting\r\ndoor. A bird is put into each compartment. If they are male and female,\r\nthey will commence within a week or two to coo and talk to each other\r\nthrough the wire, at which time the compartment is fastened up to\r\nthe top of the cage, and they are allowed to have the run of the\r\ncoop for three or four days, after which they are put into a regular\r\nbreeding-house, where they will soon take possession of the nest. If,\r\nhowever, the birds chosen simply ignore each other after they are\r\nput into the mating-cage, one of them is removed to another cage, and\r\ntwo more birds are taken from the nursery-house and put into the two\r\ncompartments. In this way we go through the nests until we have them\r\nall paired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY AILMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly in rare instances does poultry require doctoring, yet it is well\r\nto be prepared with sufficient knowledge to recognise the symptoms of\r\napproaching trouble. A few small coops should be kept in some dry,\r\nsheltered outhouse, to be used as quarantine quarters. Empty dry-goods\r\nboxes turned on their sides, with half the front boarded across and\r\na door of wire netting to close the other half, make good coops for\r\nindividual patients. They should be covered all around, sides and top\r\nand bottom, with roofing-paper, to insure freedom from draft. The\r\nboxes may be any size, but I like them about eighteen inches wide and\r\nhigh, and about two and a half feet long. To avoid dampness, and for\r\nconvenience in attending to the birds, it is well to elevate them on\r\nlegs or stand them on a shelf or bench. Before using, or whenever they\r\nare vacated, they should be disinfected and the inside thoroughly\r\npainted with whitewash. The enamelled cups without handles can be\r\nattached to the side of the coop by wire loops.\r\n\r\nThe most dreaded visitor on a poultry-farm is roup, for it not\r\nonly affects the bird during the period of immediate illness, but\r\nit leaves behind it all sorts of constitutional weaknesses to the\r\nbird’s progeny. Every poultry-keeper should cultivate the habit of\r\nscrutinising his or her flock at feed-times. A suspicious-looking bird\r\nshould be caught and removed to quarantine quarters immediately. The\r\nsymptoms of cold, influenza, canker, diphtheria and roup are in the\r\nearlier stages almost identical--watery eyes, sneezing, discharge from\r\nthe nostrils or the nostrils being stuffed up (the nostrils are the\r\ntwo small holes at the base of the bill). When the bird is noticed to\r\nhave any one of these symptoms, open the bill and look down the throat.\r\nShould there be no signs of trouble, you may be sure that there is\r\nnothing but an ordinary cold to fight, which a few days in hospital\r\nwill cure.\r\n\r\nGive light and easily digested food, such as stale bread soaked in\r\nscalded milk and squeezed almost dry or corn-meal which has been well\r\nsteamed. Put ten drops of spirits of camphor on a lump of sugar, then\r\ndissolve the sugar in a half-pint of water and use in the drinking-cup.\r\nIf, however, examination reveals yellow spots on the mouth or in the\r\nthroat, or a thick slimy discharge from the eyes and nostrils, it is a\r\nserious case of catarrh or roupy cold, which may, if neglected, develop\r\ninto malignant roup. Throughout the entire range of cold and roupy\r\ndiseases there is no special odour until malignant roup is positively\r\ndeveloped. Then there is a most offensive and unmistakable odour.\r\n\r\nTreat all diseases which overstep a common cold as roup, and you will\r\nerr on the side of safety. In the last and most malignant stages of\r\nroup, the face and eyes or head are very likely to be severely swollen,\r\nand if things have progressed to such a condition, before the bird\r\nhas been removed from the flock, it is well to take the precaution of\r\ndisinfecting the drinking and feeding dishes and generally clean up the\r\npoultry-house, and add a disinfectant to the drinking-water for a few\r\ndays. Permanganate of potassium is what I generally use, because it is\r\ncheap and most effective as a germ-killer. Dissolve one teaspoonful\r\nin a quart of warm water, and you will have such a strong solution\r\nthat for all ordinary uses can be diluted again at the rate of one\r\nteaspoonful to five of water.\r\n\r\nTreatment for roup: First wash off any discharge which may have\r\naccumulated around the eyes and bill with warm water and permanganate;\r\nthen fill an atomiser with diluted permanganate solution and thoroughly\r\nspray the throat and nostrils. Repeat night and morning, as long as\r\nthere seems any necessity. Keep the light diet as recommended for\r\ncommon cold.\r\n\r\nIndigestion and intermediate stages up to acute gastritis and liver\r\ncomplaint, all spring from the same causes, and will succumb to the\r\nsame remedies, so we will consider them connectedly. They are caused\r\nby indiscreet or excessive feeding; mash which has been allowed to\r\nbecome sour; an excess of bread, potatoes or fat in table-scraps\r\nfed to the birds; lack of corn, vegetables or sharp grit; condition\r\npowders, egg-foods, and such condiments, if given frequently, will\r\naffect the digestive organs and bring on indigestion. At first the\r\nsufferer looks mopey and stupid; the comb is pale. At this stage a\r\nfew days in hospital and a dose of magnesia and reformation in diet\r\nwill work a cure. Put about a third of a teaspoonful of sulphate of\r\nmagnesia in a cup of drinking-water. Feed a mash composed of three\r\nparts finely-cut clover-hay, which has been thoroughly steamed, and one\r\npart each of coarsely-ground corn and oats. If you haven’t clover-hay,\r\nuse wheat-bran instead; chopped apple, lettuce or any greens should\r\nbe the mid-day meal. Put a small pan of sharp grit into the coop.\r\nAdvance symptoms are watery, yellowish droppings and thirst, and the\r\ncomb becoming fiery red, which may gradually darken to crimson as the\r\nbird’s condition becomes worse. Administer a teaspoonful of castor-oil;\r\nfeed sparingly on mash, which at this stage should consist of boiled\r\nrice, scalded bread and milk or cottage-cheese. If the dysentery is\r\nvery severe, fill up a drinking-vessel with the water in which the\r\nrice was boiled. After eight hours of such diet, add twenty-five drops\r\nof tincture of nux vomica to half a pint of rice-water. Continue with\r\nlight, nourishing food for about a week.\r\n\r\nIn the fall fowls are frequently given free range, before the corn\r\nand other crops are harvested, and with the result that they gorge\r\nthemselves with new corn, which is very liable to heat and swell.\r\nIn the summer people are very likely to cut grass and throw it in\r\nto yarded hens, who will eat it greedily, but it invariably causes\r\ntrouble, being in long lengths. Lawn-clippings, which are not over\r\nan inch in length, are quite safe and, of course, supply the required\r\ngreen food which they specially crave in hot weather. When the bird is\r\nseen to have an unusually large crop and shows signs of distress, catch\r\nit and hold by the feet, head downward, then gently work the crop so as\r\nto push a little of the contents into the throat and out through the\r\nbeak. Even if only a few grains can be ejected in this way, it will\r\nhelp the strained condition of the crop and ease the bird’s sufferings.\r\nAdminister a dose of castor or sweet oil.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an obstinate case can’t be helped by simple means, and\r\nthen surgery has to be resorted to. Tie the feet together and the wings\r\nclose to the body with a broad strip of muslin, place the bird on its\r\nside on the table, calling in assistance to hold it still, and with a\r\nsharp pocket-knife make a small slit, first in the outer skin, pulling\r\none side slightly outward, then making an insertion in the crop itself.\r\nCarefully remove the contents. You need not be at all nervous about the\r\noperation, which is quite painless. After the crop is emptied, take\r\na moderately fine needle threaded with a fine sewing-silk. Take two\r\nor three stitches in the crop and cut off the thread, pull the edges\r\nof the outer skin together and fasten with two or three stitches. Of\r\ncourse, under no circumstances must the crop and the outer skin be\r\nfastened together in stitching. Keep the bird on very meagre rations\r\nfor a week or ten days.\r\n\r\nThe most common ailment of infant chickenhood is bowel trouble, and\r\none should be on the watch for the the first signs, all through the\r\nhatching season, as a few hours means much to frail baby life. A\r\nchill, dampness, improper food or dirty drinking-water are the usual\r\ncauses. Should any laxity be noticed in the droppings, remove the\r\ndrinking-water and substitute either milk which has been scalded and\r\nallowed to cool or rice-water, according to the symptoms. Feed boiled\r\nrice at least once a day. If the chicks are in a brooder, set the\r\ntemperature a little higher than under ordinary circumstances. If they\r\nare with a hen, keep her confined to the brood-coop, to insure the\r\nchicks being able to nestle to her.\r\n\r\nGapes is the second scourge of chick-life. Gapes is not truly a\r\ndisease, but the effect of a parasite worm, which is supposed only to\r\nmaterialise on ground in which poultry-droppings have been deposited\r\nfor several seasons. A gapeworm is only about five sixteenths of an\r\ninch in length and no thicker than a fine thread. Once introduced into\r\nthe bird’s throat it fastens there and sucks the blood of its victim,\r\nand, of course, a little chick has not the strength to eject it, no\r\nmatter how much it may cough or gape. They multiply very quickly. Some\r\nof the remedies are as follows: Dip the end of a small wing feather\r\nin turpentine, push it down the bird’s throat, turn two or three\r\ntimes quickly and pull out. The worm may come with it. Another is to\r\nmix salt and water or steep tobacco in water for ten minutes; pour a\r\ntablespoonful down the bird’s throat, keeping the head up, and the two\r\nholes at the base of the bill covered with your thumb and forefinger\r\nwhilst you count five. Release and suddenly turn the bird upside down,\r\nholding by the feet. It will gasp, splutter and usually eject the worm.\r\nTo exterminate the pests, have the ground, on which the birds have\r\nbeen cooped and yarded, sprinkled with quicklime (keeping the birds\r\nsafely cooped, so that they cannot get into or eat the lime). Let it\r\nlie overnight and then plough under. If such treatment is impossible,\r\nremove all the young stock to some other part of the farm. Mature birds\r\nhave the strength to eject the worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETABLE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to plan the garden on paper and make out seed lists\r\nearly in the spring, to save time later. Every family will, of\r\ncourse, have specially preferred vegetables to take precedence over\r\nothers, so individual taste alone can determine the allotted space\r\nfor each variety. Our selection and plan was made with due regard for\r\ntable pickles and preserves, all of which were bountifully supplied.\r\nTherefore, if your discrimination on such subjects is too undeveloped\r\nas yet to be trusted, accept our experience this year, and then you\r\nwill know how to reconstruct it for your personal needs. When planning\r\nout on paper, the second crop should be considered as well as the\r\nspring sowings.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of sending for seeds early is that you are sure\r\nto get the varieties selected, whereas later in the season “the best”\r\nis frequently sold out.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing a site, remember that a slight slope to the south\r\nor southeast is desirable. Size must depend very much on whether\r\nyou intend having a separate berry patch or not. A hundred feet by\r\nseventy-five feet will supply an average small family with vegetables\r\nfor the table, excepting winter potatoes, which should be a field crop.\r\n\r\nProtection from the northeast storms should be provided. Cedar or\r\nprivet is the ideal hedge for such purposes, but it takes money and\r\ntime; so, while it is developing, resort to the serviceable hurdle\r\nfence made of brush.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is fine, the last two weeks of March should see the\r\npatch of ground intended for the vegetable garden ploughed and harrowed.\r\n\r\nHave well-rotted stable manure scattered over the surface before\r\nploughing, which should be deep at first. After two or three days’\r\nairing, plough again, running the furrows crosswise; then harrow\r\nand roll and harrow again, until every clod is broken up. Thorough\r\npreparation of the soil should never be shirked, for it is more than\r\nhalf the battle. Let me caution you not to have the ploughing done\r\nif the ground be wet. Much of the disappointment which city people\r\nexperience arises from the natural desire of the amateur to get to\r\nwork. Earth ploughed, dug or hoed when wet or soggy will bake and\r\ncrust all summer. The right consistency can be ascertained by picking\r\nup a handful and squeezing it. If it remains a solid lump it is too\r\nwet, but when it presses together easily, and as readily falls apart\r\nwhen released, it is in just the right condition to work, will turn\r\na clean furrow and will readily crumble under the harrow. Sod ground\r\nis desirable for potatoes, so if there is a strip of grass land which\r\nneeds renewal, have it well ploughed, harrowed, and marked off in rows\r\neighteen inches apart, for the winter crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORNER OF THE VEGETABLE GARDEN]\r\n\r\nAlmost every old farmer has a theory about the way and size to cut\r\npotatoes for planting. After listening to and trying several methods,\r\nwe have come to the conclusion that cutting large tubers in four,\r\nand small ones through the centre lengthwise, is much better than\r\ndissecting carefully to separate every eye, and then using two pieces\r\nwhen planting, especially as the innumerable experiments made at the\r\nagricultural stations have revealed the fact that eyes gather nutriment\r\nfor sustenance and growth from the potato itself, until the sprouts\r\ndevelop stems that form joints, at which point rootlets start, proving\r\nbeyond doubt that, unless the piece of potato planted is large enough\r\nadequately to feed the eye or eyes it may contain, the root growth,\r\nwhich is required to furnish the subsequent tubers with food, must be\r\nweakened. We plant one quarter potato to every foot in the row, and\r\ncover from four to five inches deep, selecting ground which has been\r\nheavily manured the year before, and scattering wood ashes on the\r\nsurface after the seeds have been covered.\r\n\r\nFailing this source, commercial fertiliser specially prepared for\r\npotatoes must be bought. Thorough cultivation is necessary to insure a\r\ngood crop. Soon--say seven or eight days after planting--run the harrow\r\nover the field, to kill the embryo weeds and level the surface. As soon\r\nas the plants show, cultivate again, but of course only between the\r\nrows, and with an ordinary cultivator. Repeat at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that it takes fifteen bushels of potatoes after they\r\nhave been cut into quarters, to plant an acre, which should return\r\none hundred and thirty bushels of salable potatoes, by which is meant\r\nlarge and medium sized potatoes, small ones not entering into the\r\ncalculation. There will be in all probability about thirty bushels of\r\nthese dwarfs, which are excellent fattening food for poultry and pigs\r\nwhen cooked and mashed up.\r\n\r\nThe space intended for carrots requires extremely good cultivation, for\r\nthe soil must be thoroughly pulverised. Tie the seeds in a piece of\r\ncheese cloth, steep in water for twelve hours, then hang up in a warm\r\nroom to drip and dry sufficiently to prevent their sticking together\r\nwhen being planted. Another aid we furnish these delicate seedlings is\r\nto drop a radish seed every six inches, because they germinate quickly\r\nand throw a strong seed leaf, which breaks the crust over the row and\r\nallows the fragile carrot sprout free access.\r\n\r\nAllow two feet from the last row of potatoes, stretch the line, and\r\nwith a pointed stick draw a shallow drill in which to scatter the\r\ncarrot seed. Covering must not be more than a fourth of an inch; press\r\ndown firmly. Between each two rows of carrots allow one foot. Steep and\r\nuse only half the seed at first, planting the remainder twenty days\r\nlater. With good ground and cultivation you should have carrots late in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nA thirty-inch space must divide the carrots from the beets. Prepare the\r\nground as before, but make the drill a full inch deep, dropping the\r\nseed half an inch apart, the rows two feet apart. These should be ready\r\nfor use the first week in June. Keep half the seed for late planting.\r\n\r\nEarly turnips can start another two feet along. Drill half an inch\r\ndeep, the rows one foot apart.\r\n\r\n“First of All” peas are semi-dwarf, but yield much better if given some\r\nsupport. We plant every two rows seven inches apart, in a drill one\r\ninch deep, and when the peas are two inches high we stick brush between\r\nthe rows, so making a hedge of vine when developed. Twin rows should be\r\ntwo feet apart.\r\n\r\nFor onion sets, make drills an inch and a half deep, placing the sets\r\nupright and from four to six inches apart. Firm the earth all around,\r\nand the fourth of an inch over them. These will furnish early onions\r\nfor cooking. For onion seed the soil cannot be too carefully prepared,\r\nfor, like carrots, they are long in germinating and extremely fragile.\r\nA few radish seeds can again be used as pioneers. Instead of commercial\r\nfertiliser, the poultry droppings are used for onions, being reduced\r\nto a powder by grinding in an old chopping machine. Sprinkle freely,\r\nwithin one inch of the centre of the row, and from three to four inches\r\neach side of it. Unless rain falls within a few days, water very\r\nthoroughly with a sprinkler. Hen droppings seem especially desirable\r\nfor all bulbs and tubers.\r\n\r\nLettuce seed requires well-enriched soil; drill one-fourth of an inch\r\ndeep, the rows one foot apart.\r\n\r\nFrom the time seeds are put into the ground, cultivation must be\r\ncontinual, raking between rows being frequent enough to destroy embryo\r\nweeds. Ten minutes’ light work with a rake before weeds develop will\r\nsave hours of hard labour with a hoe. Cultivation is required, not only\r\nto destroy weeds, but to supply air, and encourage all the moisture\r\nfrom the subsoil to travel upward, so nourishing the plant roots as\r\nthey develop, and preventing the soil from baking. Not cultivating the\r\nground around plants is as injurious to their health as shutting a\r\nchild in an unventilated room.\r\n\r\nLettuce, cabbage and cauliflower plants should now be planted out.\r\nPrepare the rows as for seed, and with the pointed stick used for\r\nmarking the rows, make holes directly under the line--nine inches\r\napart for lettuce, one foot for cabbage and cauliflower. Put a little\r\nwater into the hole, pack the earth around the root and stem, water\r\ncopiously, then draw dry earth up over the wet surface, to prevent the\r\nmoisture from evaporating or a crust forming. To promote root growth,\r\ncut off half the length of the outer leaves with a pair of sharp\r\nscissors. If possible, provide some protection until the plants are\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nTomatoes, peppers and eggplants should be bedded out about the\r\ntwentieth of May. Tomatoes and eggplants stand two and one-half feet\r\napart, each one in ground very heavily enriched to a depth of three\r\nfeet and a circumference of two feet. Pursue the same method of\r\nplanting as for cabbage, except that instead of cutting the leaves\r\nacross, nip out the two heart leaves of each plant. Checking top growth\r\nmakes the plant branch and form a stocky bush instead of a spindly top\r\ngrowth that will break under the weight of fruit when it forms.\r\n\r\nIf the “home” is to be an ideal haven of rest it must be pretty.\r\nEconomy may prohibit buying plants for the flower garden, but the\r\nexercise of a little fore-thought will enable you to have a lovely\r\ndisplay of flowers all through the summer at a nominal cost. Procure\r\nsome shallow boxes from your grocer. They should not be more than three\r\ninches deep, and about eighteen inches long and one foot wide. If it is\r\nnot possible to get what you want, saw a six or seven inch box in half,\r\nusing the lid as a bottom for the second box.\r\n\r\nHave the mould thoroughly pulverised before sowing, and prepare an\r\nextra quantity to use for covering the seeds. This I do by half filling\r\na rather fine colander and shaking it over the box until there is an\r\neven layer over the seeds. The average small flower seed should not\r\nhave more than the fourth of an inch over it. A board that will fit\r\ninside the box should be pressed down hard, to insure the seeds being\r\nfirmly embedded in the mould. Otherwise the air gets around them and\r\ndries up and kills the first frail germs of life. After planting and\r\npatting down, sprinkle lightly, and stand the boxes in a south or\r\nsouthwest window in a living room where the temperature averages sixty\r\ndegrees. The boxes must be watched for what is called “damping off.”\r\nIt can easily be detected by the sickly appearance of the seedlings,\r\nfollowed by a shrivelling or burning of the stem close to the earth.\r\nThe moment the danger signal is noticed, prick out into fresh boxes\r\nof corresponding size or a trifle deeper. The seedlings need not be\r\nplanted more than half an inch apart. Prepare the mould in the boxes\r\nthe same as you did for the seeds, pat down, and with a toothpick\r\nmake the holes in which the baby plants are to be put, firming the\r\nearth around them gently with the forefinger of each hand. Should no\r\nsuggestion of debility appear among the seedlings, still prick out into\r\nfresh boxes when the second leaves unfold.\r\n\r\n  “Bovee” potatoes, for early garden crop       1 peck,  $0.75\r\n  Carrots, “Oxheart”                           1 ounce,    .10\r\n  Cauliflower, “Early Snowball”               1 packet,    .25\r\n  Celery                                      1 packet,    .10\r\n  Beets                                       2 ounces,    .20\r\n  Brussels sprouts                            1 packet,    .10\r\n  Cabbage, “Jersey Wakefield”                 1 packet,    .15\r\n  Cabbage, “Autumn King”                      1 packet,    .15\r\n  Kale, “Dwarf Green”                          1 ounce,    .10\r\n  Lettuce, “Boston Market”                     1 ounce,    .15\r\n  Peas, “First of All”                          1 pint,    .15\r\n  Peas, “Petit Paris”                         ½ pint,    .10\r\n  Peas, “Champion of England”                  1 quart,    .30\r\n  Turnips, “Early Flat Dutch”                 1 packet,    .05\r\n  Turnips, “Purple Top Aberdeen”              1 packet,    .05\r\n  Turnips, “Rutabaga”                         1 packet,    .10\r\n  White onion sets                             1 quart,    .25\r\n  Red onion sets                               1 quart,    .25\r\n  Onion seed, “Prizetaker”                     1 ounce,    .20\r\n  Cucumber, “White Spine”                     1 packet,    .10\r\n  Eggplant, “New York Spineless”              1 packet,    .10\r\n  Tomato, “Crimson Cushion”                   1 packet,    .10\r\n  Pepper, “Ruby King”                         1 packet,    .10\r\n  Muskmelon, “Delmonico”                      1 packet,    .10\r\n  Squash, “Long Island” (summer)              1 packet,    .10\r\n  Squash, “Gregory” (winter)                  1 packet,    .10\r\n  Green bush bean, “The Longfellow”           1 packet,    .10\r\n  Pole lima bean, “Leviathan”                 1 packet,    .10\r\n  Okra, “Long Green”                          1 packet,    .05\r\n  Radish, “Scarlet Turnip”                     1 ounce,    .10\r\n  Corn, “Country Gentleman”                   1 packet,    .15\r\n  Herbs--parsley, sage, summer savory, thyme, marjoram,\r\n    aniseed, wormwood, saffron, tansy    1 packet each,    .40\r\n                                                         -----\r\n        Total cost                                       $4.95\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOTBED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outer shells of hotbed and cold-frame are identical, and can be\r\nmade by any handy man. As all sashes are made in one size--namely, six\r\nby three--the boxes must correspond; to insure water running off and\r\nall the power of the sun being utilised, they must slope lengthways,\r\nthe top end of a box being three or four inches higher than the bottom.\r\nThe ordinary box or bed frame is made six feet long, three feet wide\r\nand fifteen inches high at the top end, sloping to twelve at the foot,\r\nand stands on the surface of the ground, but the plan we have adopted\r\nafter several years’ experience is to dig a pit three feet deep, six\r\nfeet two inches long and three feet two inches wide, and build the box\r\ntwenty inches high at the top end, sloping to seventeen inches at the\r\nfoot, and of course six feet long and three feet wide, which allows it\r\nto stand inside the dugout and five inches below the surface of the\r\nsurrounding ground, so effectually preventing any cold air creeping in\r\naround the bottom. We use sound boards two inches thick for sides and\r\nends and two-by-two studding for corner stays.\r\n\r\nVery well-made boxes and sashes, which fit exactly, are sold by\r\nseveral of the greenhouse builders for about eight dollars. They are\r\nshipped knock-down to save express charges, but they are ready to bolt\r\ntogether. They come in the ordinary six-by-three size, for single beds,\r\nor in groups of from three to five, with light partitions for the\r\nsashes to rest upon. The five-section bed costs about twelve dollars,\r\nbut will need five sashes, amounting to fifteen dollars, and the\r\npartitions, which I think are about one dollar a piece.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in bad weather, it is well to have the beds near the\r\nhouse, and, when possible, sheltered from the north and facing the\r\nsouth. Fresh horse manure constitutes the heating power in a hotbed. We\r\nuse solid droppings and dry leaves, about half and half. It is ripened\r\nin the manure-shed by being made into a heap about three feet high and\r\nthree feet wide, thoroughly sprinkled with liquid manure. It is allowed\r\nto stand some weeks after mixing, then twice forked over, two weeks\r\nintervening. All the droppings should be well broken up and mixed with\r\nthe leaves, and the entire mass repiled between each forking.\r\n\r\nAfter the ripening process has been accomplished, it must be packed\r\ninto the bottom of the hotbed to the depth of two and a half feet. It\r\nshould be smoothly laid and well tramped into place. Put in the sash,\r\nand within a few days the heat will rise to a hundred degrees or over.\r\nLift the sash slightly at one end, and wait until the temperature falls\r\nto about eighty-five degrees, then place about six inches of rich,\r\nfibrous soil over the top. We manufacture our potting-mould several\r\nmonths before it is required, by taking the old heating material from\r\nspent beds and mixing it with an equal amount of soil from sod land\r\nand about one-third the quantity of clean, sharp sand. After thorough\r\nmixing, it is piled in a large heap and left exposed to the weather\r\nuntil required, or until late in the fall, when it is put into a shed\r\nand kept dry to prevent freezing, as potting-mould and covering for\r\nfresh hotbeds is often needed in the early spring. Just before using,\r\nit is passed through a sieve to remove all lumps.\r\n\r\nThe first year, when there is no old bed to empty, good top-dressing or\r\npotting-mould can be made by cutting deep sods, shaking the earth from\r\nthe roots and mixing it with an equal amount of old, well-rotted cow\r\nmanure and about one quarter the amount of clean sand. It is imperative\r\nto prepare all such things in the fall. The outside of a hotbed should\r\nbe banked up with rough stable manure and the sash covered at night\r\nwith mats and shutters in extreme cold weather. Old carpet or bags\r\nmade of burlap and filled with cut hay will cost nothing except time\r\nand answer quite well. We use pads, for which all sorts of old clothes\r\nare utilised. Then unbleached sheets large enough to cover the sash,\r\nside and ends, and reach well onto the ground, are used. The sheets are\r\ngiven two coats of oil, and so are impervious to rain or snow, and we\r\nthink better than wooden shutters.\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to make your first venture with winter salads, the\r\nfirst gathering for Thanksgiving, and from then on until spring. Start\r\none bed the first week in October, sow three rows of lettuce seed five\r\ninches apart, sowing three different varieties, Tennis-Ball, Boston\r\nMarket and Big Boston; two rows of curly cress (peppergrass) the same\r\ndistance apart, and five days later, two rows of white mustard. Eight\r\nor ten days later, prepare a second bed, so that the heat may have\r\nrisen and decreased to about seventy-five by the time lettuce is large\r\nenough to transplant--about three weeks from the sowing of the seed.\r\nSet out the seedlings eight inches apart each way in the new bed, and\r\nsow radish seed between the rows.\r\n\r\nIf you have enough frames, plant the three different varieties of\r\nlettuce in different beds. They will mature in the rotation named.\r\nBetween the rows of the Boston Market and the Big Boston, onion\r\nseeds may be sown. When selecting lettuce to transplant, choose the\r\nstrong seedlings and from different parts of the rows, so that when\r\nthe surplus plants are thinned out, the rest will be left to grow\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe mustard and cress will be ready to cut in from seven to ten days\r\nafter the mustard is sown. Cut the cress with a pair of scissors a\r\nlittle above the soil and it will spring again and again. Mustard\r\nmust be sowed after each gathering, but as it only takes half the\r\ntime to develop, it will be ready when the second crop of cress is.\r\nMustard should be allowed to grow more than an inch and a half above\r\nthe ground. One important thing to remember in running a succession\r\nof hotbed crops, is that the heating power of manure only lasts about\r\nseven weeks. Beans, beets and Swiss chard, and such hardy things,\r\nwhich require two months or more to mature, do not suffer through\r\nthe decrease of heat, in fact, will do just as well, or better, in a\r\nspent hotbed or cold-frame, which is just a hotbed without any heating\r\nmaterial. But if very cold weather sets in, bank up heavily around the\r\nsides and ends with fresh manure, to keep the cold from penetrating the\r\nbed-box, and using extra heavy mats over the sash at night.\r\n\r\nEggplant, tomatoes and peppers should be started the last week in\r\nFebruary, and celery, cabbage, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts about\r\nthe first of March. One bed should be devoted to onion seed (sown at\r\nthe end of February), and seedlings can be pricked out into another bed\r\nor cold-frame when about two inches high, and will be strong bulbs to\r\nplant out in the garden in April. Cucumbers, muskmelons and squash can\r\nall be started on sods in a hotbed, early in April, and will be sturdy\r\nplants by May 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GROW ASPARAGUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy every garden has not an asparagus-bed is an unfathomable mystery to\r\nme. It is universally liked; even epicures consider it a delicacy. It\r\nis ready for table use in very early spring, when everyone craves fresh\r\nvegetables, and it is as easy to grow as any other vegetable after it\r\nis once established.\r\n\r\nProbably the last word explains the mystery. It takes three years to\r\nestablish, or, rather, to bring it to the profitable stage. A light\r\ncrop can be gathered the second season, so the home table profits\r\nalmost as quickly as in the case of artichokes or strawberries.\r\nWhatever the cause, the fact remains that an asparagus-bed is rarely\r\nfound on a farm. Yet the pecuniary advantages to be reaped from\r\nasparagus-growing are sufficient to satisfy the most ambitious gardener.\r\n\r\nThree years after our first bed from seed was started we sold three\r\nhundred and fifty-four bunches at an average of forty cents a bunch.\r\nEarly in the season we got fifty cents, toward the end of the season\r\nsome were sold for thirty-five cents. Since then the annual returns\r\nhave never dropped below two hundred and eighty-six dollars. Manuring\r\nand cultivating cost approximately twelve dollars a year. The bed\r\noccupied about a quarter of an acre of ground. Having a number of egg\r\ncustomers, we sell direct and so get the full price, but even wholesale\r\nprices range from fifteen to twelve cents.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of starting beds, sowing seed or setting out plants.\r\nOne-year-old plants will cost from sixty cents to a dollar a hundred.\r\nPlanted in April and well cared for, they will provide several dishes\r\nfor the home table the following spring and nearly a full crop the\r\nsecond spring. Seed sowed at the same time will take a year longer,\r\nbut after that will give a larger yield than the transplanted plants\r\nand, as asparagus-beds are productive for fifteen or twenty years,\r\nthe one-year loss in the beginning is an economy. But it is well to\r\nset out a few plants, simply because in the country one cannot get\r\nSouthern vegetables, which come into the city early in the spring, and,\r\ntherefore, should try to have a home supply as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn selecting ground for an asparagus-bed, it must be remembered\r\nthat it is a permanent crop, and cannot be transplanted after it is\r\nestablished. It will grow on any ordinary garden soil which is well\r\ndrained, but, when possible, heavy subsoil with light sand or loam\r\nabove it should be selected, as it will invariably produce an earlier\r\ncrop each year than heavy ground. The soil should slope to the south or\r\nsouthwest, and a shelter from the northeast is also desirable. For our\r\nlarge market bed we used land that had been under cultivation for two\r\nyears. The preceding crops had been corn, oats and potatoes, so it had\r\nbeen thoroughly worked.\r\n\r\nAfter the potatoes were harvested in the fall, the field was ploughed,\r\nand barn-yard manure scattered broadcast over it. Early the following\r\nspring the ground was again ploughed, to turn in the manure, and\r\nharrowed each way to thoroughly break up and pulverise the soil. Should\r\nyou be compelled to use ground that has not been worked previously, and\r\nis of a heavy, damp character, it would be well to plough as early as\r\npossible in summer, if necessary, using a subsoil plough, to break the\r\nground to a depth of fifteen or sixteen inches.\r\n\r\nHarrow to smooth the surface, and repeat the harrowing about every\r\nthree weeks until October, when it should be ploughed again to the\r\ndepth of six or seven inches, manured and left until spring. After\r\nthe spring harrowing the rows must be marked out five feet apart and\r\nrunning from north to south. Use the plough back and forth in the same\r\nfurrow to make a wide trench, which should be six or seven inches deep\r\nand about a foot wide. If much of the soil falls back into the trench,\r\nremove it with a spade or broad hoe, then plant seed about three inches\r\napart. Keep the rows free from weeds all through the season and the\r\nground loose around the plants.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to utilise the space between the rows, as it insures\r\nthe ground being well cultivated. Each space will accommodate two rows\r\nof carrots, onions or lettuce, or one row of cabbage. In the fall,\r\nwhen the tops of the asparagus begin to die, they must be cut off and\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nThe following spring the ground between the rows should be manured and\r\nploughed, or spaded if the place is an inclosed garden and a plough\r\ncannot be used. Strong roots may throw very good-sized sprouts, but\r\ndon’t be tempted to gather them, for their removal will stimulate the\r\nplant to throw up more stalks than its age warrants, and the result\r\nwill be either death or a weakly, unprofitable existence for several\r\nseasons. Not more than one row of carrots or onions should be grown\r\nbetween the rows the second season, and, unless space is of great\r\nvalue, it is as well not to use it at all.\r\n\r\nCultivation must be kept up all through the growing season, to destroy\r\nweeds and keep the ground in condition. Many amateurs have an idea\r\nthat hoeing or cultivating of any sort is solely to destroy weeds,\r\nwhich is a great mistake. Stirring the surface soil breaks the crust,\r\nand the powdered earth forms a mulch which keeps the lower soil moist,\r\na condition which liberates the mineral qualities which constitute\r\nplant-food.\r\n\r\nThe second spring after sowing seed a light crop of stalks may be\r\ngathered, say two or three from each hill, but not more. Then allow the\r\nstalks to grow and feather out until they assume their full fern-like\r\nform. In June apply a moderate quantity of barn-yard manure between\r\nthe rows if the ground is not being used. If it is occupied by a crop,\r\nuse commercial fertiliser composed of equal parts of nitrate of soda,\r\nsulphate of potash and wood-ashes. Scatter each side of whatever\r\nvegetable occupies the space between the rows and work the fertiliser\r\nwell into the soil.\r\n\r\nIn August, when the crop is harvested, apply a moderately heavy\r\ndressing of well-rotted barn-yard manure. Late in October cut down\r\nstalks and burn, as the year before; then plough or spade between the\r\nrows. The third spring will bring the bed to a profitable state, though\r\nit will not reach its full yearly capacity for another year. Use the\r\none-horse cultivator or hoe between the rows as early as the ground can\r\nbe worked. Draw the earth slightly from the roots at first, to permit\r\nthe sun to warm the ground around the roots and awaken the plant to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nA week or so later, if white asparagus is desired, the soil must be\r\nagain drawn up over the plants and each row hilled up so as to bleach\r\nthe sprouts. The operation will need repeating about once a week all\r\nthrough the cutting season, which should not last more than three weeks\r\non so young a bed, though in future years it may be kept up six or even\r\neight weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the cutting season throw down the ridges made by the hilling-up\r\nand apply either barn-yard manure or commercial fertiliser, repeating\r\nthe application about July 1st. If green asparagus is desired, the only\r\ndifference in treatment consists in omitting the hilling-up.\r\n\r\nAfter the third year care of the bed consists of manuring and\r\ncultivating. We have found it best to use barn-yard manure and\r\ncommercial fertiliser alternately. Sowing the seed in trenches or deep\r\nfurrows is done to insure the crowns being three or four inches below\r\nthe surface when they have developed considerable growth, which would\r\nnot be the case if they were sown on the level ground to commence with.\r\nLike its cousin, the lily of the valley, asparagus sends out roots and\r\nstalks from a heart or crown, which must be underground where it is\r\nmoist and dark.\r\n\r\nAsparagus may be canned like any other vegetable for winter use; pack,\r\ncut ends down, in glass jars, fill jars with cold water, put the lids\r\non loosely, stand in hot water, boil three hours, fill the jars to the\r\nbrim with boiling water and screw lids down tight.\r\n\r\nIf you consider that raising from seed is beyond your patience,\r\nbuy plants from a reliable grower. Most nurserymen’s catalogues\r\nquote one and two year plants, but the experienced are unanimous in\r\npreferring strong one-year-old plants, affirming that they stand being\r\ntransplanted better than the older ones. The ground must be prepared\r\nas for seed. When the plants arrive, put them into water for twelve or\r\ntwenty-four hours to soften. Set the plants two feet apart in trenches,\r\nbeing careful to have the crowns right side up. If you hold up a plant\r\nin your hand you will notice that the thick fleshy roots all proceed\r\nfrom the heart, or crown, as it is called, and droop downward, and\r\nthat on the other side of the crown there are what look like small\r\nrootlets. These are really the dry stalks from the preceding season and\r\nbuds of the coming season, and are often mistaken for roots and placed\r\ndownward in the trenches instead of upward, which of course they should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe proper way to plant is to make a small mound at the bottom of the\r\ntrench--about two handfuls of soil--and spread out the roots, and place\r\nthe crown on the mound of earth in such a way that the roots envelope\r\nit. Press them firmly into place, and cover until the crown is about\r\ntwo inches below the soil. If it happens to be a dry season, water\r\nregularly until growth is well established.\r\n\r\nAsparagus must be cut very carefully, otherwise the embryo shoot may\r\nbe destroyed or the crown itself killed. When only small quantities\r\nare being removed each day, the best plan is to pass the thumb and\r\nforefinger down the spur an inch or two into the ground, then bend\r\noutward, and it will snap below the surface of the earth without\r\ninjuring the plant in any way. When large beds are being cut for\r\nmarket, a knife will have to be used, as it does the work so much more\r\nquickly. Asparagus-knives are of special shape. There are several\r\non the market, and they will be found advertised in all seedmen’s\r\ncatalogues. The average price is fifty cents.\r\n\r\nRust, a fungus disease, has become very prevalent during the last few\r\nyears, attacking both young and old beds. As the name implies, it looks\r\nlike rust on the stalks and spoils the appearance for market, besides\r\ninjuring the plant and materially affecting the crop.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by many who have studied the subject that rust\r\noriginates on decaying stalks. For that reason it is advisable to burn\r\nthe dead stalks as soon as they are cut away in the fall, instead of\r\nallowing them to decay on a compost-heap, as one does with other garden\r\ntrimmings. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture after the cutting season each\r\nyear has been recommended as a preventive. Once established, there\r\nseems no remedy. We have a neighbour whose beds were seriously affected\r\nseven or eight years ago. He tried a number of ordinary washes and\r\npowders, but they seemed useless. Six years ago he started new beds and\r\nadopted our plan of alternating commercial fertiliser with barn-yard\r\nmanure as we had never had any sign of rust, and he attributed it to\r\nthe ashes in the mixture we used, thinking that they purified the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnother enemy is the asparagus-beetle--an attractive-looking insect,\r\njet black, with red, yellow and blue markings. It remains hidden in\r\nbrush or rubbish through the winter and comes out in the first warm\r\ndays of spring to lay its eggs, always choosing the young, tender\r\nsprouts for their resting-place. In a few days the young grubs hatch\r\nand feed on the asparagus, boring small holes, entirely ruining the\r\nappearance of the stalks, and occasionally descend to the crown of\r\nthe plant itself. It only takes the grubs a month to pass through the\r\nseveral stages which bring them to maturity, so that if only one or\r\ntwo beetles survive the winter, there may be an army by the time the\r\nbeds are bearing fully. Allowing poultry to run on the beds in the fall\r\nand winter is about the safest and easiest way of scotching the pests,\r\nthough dusting with air-slaked lime in the early spring is recommended,\r\nand some authorities suggest the cutting of the beds as soon as shoots\r\ndevelop in the early spring, hoping in that way to destroy the eggs.\r\nThis is rather an expensive remedy, as it means burning up the early\r\nmarket crop, which brings the best prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GROW MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who has a good cellar where an even temperature can be\r\nmaintained can grow mushrooms for home use, but if they are to be\r\nraised in large quantities for market, an appropriate building must be\r\ngiven over to their exclusive use. We have been successful for several\r\nseasons in growing mushrooms in an amateurish way, but it was not until\r\na large root-cellar was left vacant that we thought of the feasibility\r\nof adding them to our market products.\r\n\r\nThe farm we were lucky enough to acquire was one of the old-fashioned,\r\npractical places, with a full equipment of buildings. Under the\r\ncow-barn there was a stone basement, used for the winter storing of\r\nroot crops. After our dairy herd developed, it seemed wise to use\r\nensilage instead of roots during the winter. So we built a silo, and\r\nthis left the store-house vacant. It was eighty feet long and fifteen\r\nfeet wide, so, after we conceived the mushroom idea, we partitioned off\r\nthirty feet to retain as a storing-place for household vegetables and\r\nfitted up the other fifty feet with mushroom-beds.\r\n\r\nWe put in a brooder-house stove and pipe system, which cost one hundred\r\nand twenty dollars. The lumber for the beds cost an additional thirty\r\ndollars, extra manure twenty-two dollars and spawn fifty dollars--two\r\nhundred and twenty-two dollars in all. Four months later we had\r\nreceived four hundred and forty-five dollars. Since then the returns\r\nhave fluctuated between four and five hundred dollars, and we estimate\r\nthat it costs one hundred and twenty-five dollars per season to produce\r\nthe crop. So I think that mushrooms can be considered profitable when\r\nrun in connection with poultry or general farming, especially as they\r\ncome in at a season of the year when there is very little else to\r\nbe attended to, and, what is more, the only heavy work is preparing\r\nmanure and compost for the beds, and that any ordinary farm man can\r\naccomplish. The rest is all so light and easy that a young girl or a\r\ndelicate woman can attend to it without fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to have an expensive stone or brick building. We\r\nhave a neighbour who uses part of an old cow-stable, and a man in the\r\nsuburbs of New York, who grows a quantity each season, has simply\r\na dugout with rough board walls, two feet above the ground, and an\r\nA-shaped roof--all covered with tar-paper, a place that could not\r\nhave cost more than seventy-five dollars at the very most. A shed or\r\noutbuilding of any kind will answer if it is weather-proof and can be\r\nkept at a temperature of fifty-five or sixty in zero weather without\r\nmuch expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSHROOMS]\r\n\r\nDon’t be tempted to start on any elaborate scale in the house-cellar,\r\nfor the odour from the beds whilst the manure is heating prior to\r\nplanting-time will permeate the entire house and cling to carpets and\r\ndraperies in a most horrible way. Of course, this does not obtain\r\nwhen only a few are to be raised for the home table, because shallow\r\nboxes can be used and need not be carried into the cellar until the\r\nobjectionable period is past.\r\n\r\nWhen a special house is used, the beds may be made on the floor, a\r\ngreat depth of manure used and artificial heat dispensed with. But it\r\nis not a good or economical plan, for the necessary amount of stable\r\nmanure would cost as much as fuel, necessitate close watching and the\r\nresult would not be as satisfactory, so we will only consider the\r\napproved method of benches and artificial heat, which is generally\r\nadopted by the modern market grower.\r\n\r\nThe benches in our house run on each side, leaving walks three feet\r\nwide through the centre of the house, two feet along the side walls.\r\nHaving the three walks enables us to gather from each side of the beds,\r\nwhich is almost a necessity when the beds are four feet wide. With a\r\nnarrower house and beds, a centre path would be sufficient, but it\r\nshould not be less than three feet wide for convenience when filling\r\nand emptying beds.\r\n\r\nThe benches are made of two-by-two studding and rough hemlock boards,\r\nthe studding being used for the upright supports which go from floor\r\nto ceiling, every five feet of the entire length and on each side of\r\nthe house. Supports are run diagonally between each four uprights on\r\neach side of the house, to make a foundation for the floor of the beds,\r\nas well as to strengthen the entire structure. The hemlock boards are\r\nused for the sides and bottoms of the beds, which are two feet above\r\nthe ground. Beds should be sixteen inches deep, but we used one row of\r\nboards nine inches wide and another row six inches wide, as the boards\r\nhappened to be cut in those sizes.\r\n\r\nThe second tier of beds, which were added a year later, were a foot and\r\na half above the top of the first tier and only twelve inches deep, but\r\nhave proved quite as satisfactory in every way, and as the shallow beds\r\ntake less manure, I think it is safe to advise beginners to adopt the\r\nlatter depth for beds in a house where artificial heat is used.\r\n\r\nThe bottoms and sides of the beds should be fixed so that they can be\r\neasily removed, as it facilitates the work of emptying beds, which has\r\nto be done every spring. Any heating apparatus which can be easily\r\narranged and depended upon can, of course, be used, but I think the\r\nstove and pipes which are specially made for poultry plants are the\r\nmost convenient, as their construction is so simple that any handy man\r\ncan fix them without the aid of a plumber--a great consideration on the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nNarrow cellar windows were inserted in the sides of the house, to\r\nfurnish light and air in the spring and fall, when the heavy work was\r\nbeing done, and also while gathering each day during the season. It is\r\nso much pleasanter to work by daylight, and it does not injure the\r\ncrop in any way, if shutters are used to keep out the cold.\r\n\r\nThe main factor in mushroom-growing is beds. First, the material\r\nof which they are composed; secondly, the way they are made. Fresh\r\nmanure, with a fair percentage of short bedding (straw or leaves\r\npreferably), must be collected each day when the stables are cleaned.\r\nWe use two parts horse and one part cow manure, sometimes substituting\r\nsheep-droppings for horse. The daily collection must be stored in a\r\nshed and made into a pile about three feet high and two and a half feet\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nAs soon as sufficient manure is collected to fill the beds, the curing\r\nprocess should be commenced. This consists of packing manure closely\r\ntogether, and if at all dry, slightly moistening it with water or\r\ndrainage from the stables to start fermentation. Within a few hours the\r\nheat will commence to create steam and it must be forked over and made\r\ninto a fresh pile.\r\n\r\nTo check the heat, which would, if left to run its course, quickly\r\nburn out the value of the manure and render it worthless, forking and\r\nrepiling will probably have to be repeated three or four times, with\r\nfrom two to three days intervening, according to the strength of the\r\nmanure and the temperature. It usually takes from two to three weeks\r\nto cure manure properly. When it shows a temperature of one hundred\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit after being undisturbed for thirty-six hours, it may\r\nbe considered all right.\r\n\r\nWe half fill beds with the rough material, then mix soil from\r\nsod ground with the remainder to fill up the top of the beds. The\r\nproportion is about one-third soil to two-thirds prepared manure. When\r\nfilling the beds, the manure, and also the mixture of soil and manure,\r\nshould be strewed in thin layers, say about two inches at a time, and\r\nstamped down thoroughly before the next layer is added. When the beds\r\nare filled, cover the surface with straw or mats to prevent the beds\r\nbecoming dry.\r\n\r\nThe manure will heat considerably after being packed in the beds, so\r\nthermometers should be inserted every few feet, as planting must not\r\nbe done until the temperature falls to ninety degrees Fahrenheit, at\r\nwhich stage the straw or mat can be removed and the spawn inserted.\r\nThe propagation of mushrooms is entirely different from that of any\r\nother vegetable, neither seed, bulb, nor cutting holding any place in\r\nthe process. From the gill-like lining of a full-grown mushroom fall\r\ninnumerable spores, so minute that if caught on a sheet of paper they\r\nwould look like dust. If the spores fall upon earth that is in just the\r\nright condition, mould-like filaments develop, spread and become what\r\nwe call spawn.\r\n\r\nSpawn culture is a complicated process, which concerns the grower of\r\nmushrooms not at all, as he buys spawn as he would any other seed,\r\nexcept that it is sold in compressed brick-like cakes, which weigh\r\nabout a pound apiece, or in rough shreds; the latter variety being\r\nknown as flake or French spawn.\r\n\r\nBricks, known as English spawn, seem to give the best results in this\r\ncountry and are what we have always used. They should be broken into\r\npieces about the size of a walnut, planted in rows a foot apart, the\r\npieces being six inches apart in the rows. The spawn should be inserted\r\nabout three inches. The best plan is to lift a small part of the manure\r\nwith a hand fork, press down the spawn, replace the manure and press\r\nfirmly in place. The close packing is one of the principal points of\r\nsuccess, so it is well to go over the entire bed with the back of a\r\nwooden shovel or a small mallet.\r\n\r\nAfter planting replace the straw or mats if the temperature of the\r\nhouse is at all dry. Eight days later remove the mats and cover the\r\nbeds with a layer two inches thick of good garden soil.\r\n\r\nUntil the mushrooms begin to appear the temperature of the house may be\r\nsixty-five to sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit, but from the moment they\r\ncommence to appear keep it as nearly fifty-five as possible. Moisture\r\nmust be carefully watched. If the beds appear at all dry, even after\r\nthe soil has been placed over them, cover with mats for a few days or\r\neven sprinkle the beds very lightly, but they must not be made at all\r\nwet. Perhaps the safest plain for the inexperienced is to sprinkle the\r\nwalks, as then there can be no danger of an overdose.\r\n\r\nIt takes about five weeks for spawn to spread through the beds and\r\nabout another two weeks before the crop makes its appearance. Well-made\r\nbeds, in a house kept at fifty-five degrees, will yield for ten or\r\ntwelve weeks, but during the last two or three weeks the quantity will\r\ndecrease rapidly.\r\n\r\nGathering must be done every day, and in the height of the yield it is\r\nwise to go through the beds twice a day to avoid the loss which occurs\r\nwithin a few hours from overripening. When the mushroom first breaks\r\nthrough the ground, it is apparently a solid, white ball, balanced on\r\na miniature column. A few hours, and the under part of the ball breaks\r\nfrom the stock and the mushroom gradually spreads like an umbrella\r\nbeing opened and shows a line of pale pink, or flesh-coloured, gills,\r\nwhich become darker every hour until almost black, at which stage the\r\nmushroom becomes thin and rapidly decays.\r\n\r\nIf mushrooms are gathered just after the veil (as the skin which\r\nattaches the edge of the cap to the stock is technically termed)\r\nbreaks, they can be held over for twenty-four hours without\r\ndeteriorating, if kept in a cool place away from the air. If, by\r\nchance, some open ones escape the picker’s notice, remove them as soon\r\nas seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX GOOD VEGETABLES TO GROW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange that many of the most useful vegetables are neglected\r\nin the majority of home gardens. Okra, Swiss chard, leeks, Brussels\r\nsprouts and Scotch kale are really little known, yet they are all\r\nappetizing health additions to the table, and require no special\r\nconditions or culture.\r\n\r\nOkra, or gumbo, as it is invariably called in the South, figures very\r\nlargely in Creole cooking, but here in the East is only just appearing\r\nin the markets. The demand is sure to grow rapidly, because it is one\r\nof those insidious articles which seem indispensable when once used.\r\nSoups, stews, gravies and innumerable made dishes are all improved by a\r\nlittle okra, and it is the basis of many special dishes. My household\r\nis fond of gumbo soup, so for that alone okra had to have a place in\r\nthe garden, and now we use it in a dozen different ways. Cut into\r\nslices and spread alternately with rice and tomatoes in a casserole,\r\nwith butter, in which curry-powder and salt has been mixed, dotted all\r\nover the top and baked for three hours, it is a deliciously savoury\r\nluncheon dish.\r\n\r\nBut it is the growing, not the cooking, of this neglected vegetable\r\nthat I have to do with just now. The ground for okra should be\r\nthoroughly enriched and well cultivated. Make a furrow about an inch\r\ndeep, and if only a home supply is wanted, about thirty feet long. Sow\r\nthe seeds two inches apart in rows and cover. Thin to eighteen inches\r\napart when the seedlings are about two inches high. If more than one\r\nrow is to be grown, make them two and a half feet apart.\r\n\r\nOkra is a semi-tropical plant, so is better not sown until the second\r\nweek in May. Once started, it grows very rapidly, yields and continues\r\na supply of pods throughout the season. The flowers are large and\r\nrather pretty, but only last a few hours; after they fall it takes\r\nabout twelve hours for a pod to develop sufficiently for gathering. To\r\nbe in perfect condition for cooking they should not be much more than\r\nan inch long. Any surplus quantity can be dried or canned for winter\r\nuse. Sliced, they are a splendid addition to mixed pickles.\r\n\r\nSwiss chard is such a true cut-and-come-again that for home or market\r\nit is invaluable, and a poultry-keeper can find no better or cheaper\r\ngreen food for fowls that are yarded. The leaves and stalks are the\r\nedible part, and can be boiled like spinach or the stalks alone used.\r\nThey are white and run the full length of the leaf. Cut them out and\r\ntie loosely; cook and serve just as you would asparagus. The new\r\nvariety called “Lucullus” is, I think, the best. Make the ground very\r\nrich; sow in rows three feet apart, about the end of April or the first\r\nweek in May. Thin the plants when they are about two inches high to\r\nstand eighteen inches apart. When used as spinach cut the leaves when\r\nthey are ten inches high, but when the stalks are to simulate asparagus\r\ngathering should be delayed until they are about fourteen inches high.\r\nThen cut off the green part of the leaf, which can still be used as\r\ngreens. No matter how the leaves are to be used or at what height the\r\ncrop is cut, be very careful never to injure the heart of the plant,\r\nfor if you do successive crops will be spoiled.\r\n\r\nBrussels sprouts have been gaining favour in the market during the last\r\nfew years and should certainly be in every garden, for they possess\r\nall the healthful qualities of cabbage, and the flavour is much more\r\ndelicate.\r\n\r\nWhen small, the plants look exactly like cabbage, but instead of firm,\r\nsolid heads, the stalks run up to twelve or fourteen inches in height,\r\nand baby cabbages spring out all around the stalk for the entire\r\nlength. One plant often yields thirty-five or forty of these diminutive\r\ncabbages.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of Brussels sprouts is that the seed need not be\r\nsown until June and the plants are not ready for transplanting until\r\nJuly, so can succeed early peas in the same ground. Like all members\r\nof the cabbage family, Brussels sprouts are gluttons and positively\r\nmust have heavy and rich ground. Sow seed in shallow drills; transplant\r\nwhen seedlings are about three inches high, two feet apart in rows\r\nthree feet apart. For early spring harvest, sow seeds in hotbed during\r\nFebruary or March. Mature plants are quite hardy, but must be dug up\r\nbefore severe frost. The best way to keep the home supply is to hang\r\nthe whole plant up by the roots in a frost-proof cellar.\r\n\r\nLeeks and winter onions are members of the onion family which are\r\nusually overlooked, and it is a great pity, because they are both\r\nmost desirable. Leeks should be sown on very fine, rich soil. A heavy\r\ndressing of poultry manure, applied the fall before planting, is an\r\nideal fertiliser. Scatter the seed thick in rows two feet apart and\r\nthin out the plants so that they stand nine inches apart. Cultivate the\r\nground constantly and hill up as the plants grow. This is a part of\r\nthe work which must not be neglected, as it encourages the growth and\r\nbleaches the stalks. A slight frost won’t hurt them, but they must be\r\nheavily banked up and covered with litter if they are to stay out in\r\nthe ground until spring.\r\n\r\nThe winter supply of these vegetables should be dug in December and\r\nstored in the house for convenience. Pack them, standing up as they\r\ngrow, in boxes; scatter earth between them, and keep them in a dark\r\ncellar. For soups they are much superior to ordinary onions. Boiled and\r\nserved with white sauce, they are a most enjoyable vegetable.\r\n\r\nWinter bunch onions, as they are termed, are really the earliest of all\r\nspring onions. Sow the seed in shallow drills, a foot apart, in May\r\nor June. Cultivate until fall, then cover with litter. Early in the\r\nfollowing spring rake off and cultivate lightly between the rows, and\r\nyou will have delicious green onions for table or market when other\r\npeople are thinking about sowing the seed.\r\n\r\nKale should be considered indispensable in every garden, for it comes\r\ninto season late in the fall, when frost has demolished all other\r\ngreens. Even in the vicinity of New York it can be relied upon to\r\nfurnish early spring greens almost before the snow is off the ground.\r\nIn fact, I have gathered it from under deep snow in midwinter and found\r\nit in good condition. Seeds should be sown about the middle of June,\r\nand the seedlings transplanted into rows two feet and a half apart.\r\nThe leaves are curly and of a dark green, and should not be used until\r\nthere has been some frost, for until frozen they are as tough as they\r\nare tender after Jack Frost has visited them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather becomes colder, bank straw or leaves on each\r\nside of the rows up to the top of the kale and then put cedar branches\r\nor brush of some sort along each side to keep the covering in place.\r\n\r\nKohlrabi is another valuable vegetable, which comes in when other\r\nthings have faded. It really belongs to the cabbage family, but it\r\nis more like the turnip. The edible part is the bulb which develops\r\nabove ground. When cooked it looks and tastes like a most delicately\r\nflavoured turnip. As they must be cooked while young and tender, it is\r\nbest to make several sowings; one in the hotbed in February, and two\r\nothers in the open ground; the first in May, the second in August.\r\nThey can stand quite a heavy frost and so are usable until December or\r\nJanuary, according to the season.\r\n\r\nSow in rows placed about two feet apart, and after the young plants\r\nhave attained sufficient strength to withstand attacks from beetles and\r\nsuch insects, thin them to two feet apart.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is as well to add a few hints about the general cultivation\r\nof these vegetables--hints which will be useful for all gardening.\r\nCultivation must be constant and thorough, especially when the soil is\r\nlight and sandy. Of course, no good gardener will permit weeds to get\r\na foothold in his territory, but the constant use of the rake is much\r\nmore important, for it keeps up the supply of moisture in the soil\r\naround the roots of the plants, and so insures their being well fed and\r\nmaking rapid growth.\r\n\r\nThis is a point which always seems to puzzle inexperienced gardeners,\r\nso it needs explanation. Stirring the surface soil with a fine rake as\r\nsoon as it is partly dry after a rain, furnishes a mulch of dust which\r\nprevents the moisture in the lower earth escaping, because it checks\r\nthe capillary process by which moisture travels to the surface and is\r\ncarried into the air. The soil may be rich in the mineral and animal\r\ncomponents which constitute plant-food, but unless moisture is present\r\nin sufficient quantities these are not available as sustenance for\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PLANT AND CULTIVATE STRAWBERRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nJust why growing one’s own strawberries should create a sense\r\nof superiority is difficult to say, but it does. City friends,\r\nwho accept really difficult agricultural accomplishments with\r\nmatter-of-fact indifference, tender a sort of wondering respect to\r\nthe strawberry-grower, and what is more extraordinary, the grower\r\ninvariably accepts the laudation with the condescending pride of a\r\nvictor. At least, I must own to some such feeling, even though I\r\nknow how absurd it is, for the small wild berry is indigenous to\r\nthis country and was adopted by the thrifty colonial housewives as a\r\ngarden-plant long before the horticulturists dreamed of taking it under\r\ntheir scientific management.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated strawberries are somewhat like exotics, having been\r\ncreated in Europe from the native wild berry and a somewhat similar\r\nwild plant brought from Chili in 1750. Varieties resulting from that\r\ncross were subsequently brought to this country and furnished the stock\r\nfrom which has gradually been developed the large, luscious fruit of\r\nto-day. But it still likes American soil and so will thrive in a wider\r\nrange of latitude than any other cultivated plant.\r\n\r\nThere are several strawberry farms in our vicinity and, according to\r\nthe owners, they bear most profitable crops. One grower tells me that\r\nhe averages six thousand quarts to the acre, and gets an average price\r\nof eight cents a quart. Another neighbour says he calculates to clear\r\nthree hundred dollars an acre from his berries. Personally, I can’t\r\nquote figures, because we have never gone in for market berries. Being\r\nvery fond of them, and wanting the very best we could possibly grow,\r\nwe have always confined our efforts to garden culture, just for home\r\nconsumption, and the reward has been such epicurean feasts that we have\r\nbeen satisfied.\r\n\r\nLike asparagus, strawberry beds should be established as soon as the\r\nfamily has settled in a country home, because it takes a year to get a\r\nfull crop. There are a great many varieties to choose from, but I think\r\nit is best to restrict selection to the old established kinds. The\r\nMarshall for first early, the Glen Mary for mid-season and the Gandy\r\nfor late gathering. And truly I don’t believe there can be a better\r\nselection for the home garden in the vicinity of New York.\r\n\r\nBut, as some varieties do better than others in a certain locality,\r\nit is advisable to consult old residents in the neighbourhood and the\r\nnurserymen from whom plants are ordered.\r\n\r\nLight sandy soil, sloping slightly to the south, will produce the\r\nearliest berries, but we are convinced from experience that slightly\r\nheavier soil and a more northerly exposure produces a better fruit in\r\nmid-season. Our beds all slope to the south, but the late varieties\r\nare so situated that they are slightly shaded by a row of young pear\r\ntrees, which protects them from the direct rays of the sun. The soil\r\nis--or rather was--of ordinary quality, neither very sandy nor very\r\nheavy, so for several seasons we scattered fine coal ashes between the\r\nrows of the early plants, which materially lightened the soil, and for\r\nseveral years we have had berries from five to ten days earlier than\r\nour neighbours.\r\n\r\nNew beds may be started in the fall or spring, whichever is the most\r\nconvenient. If the plants are set out in the early fall, they will bear\r\nthe following season, but if planting is delayed until spring, it will\r\nbe a full year before any fruit can be expected. So I recommend August\r\nplanting of all plants to the beginner, and spring planting when there\r\nare established beds to take other plants from.\r\n\r\nTo explain: Strawberries are propagated from the runners, which, under\r\nnatural conditions, shoot out from the parent plants and, taking root,\r\ndevelop individual crowns. But the up-to-date nurseryman has of late\r\nyears taken to sinking small pots filled with rich earth in the beds,\r\nthen by lifting the ends of the runners on to the pots the roots of the\r\nyoung plants develop within the pot instead of on the ground and can\r\nlater in the season be removed without any check to growth, which, of\r\ncourse, greatly facilitates the growth of the crown after it is set out\r\nin its permanent position.\r\n\r\nPot plants, as they are called, are slightly more expensive than layer\r\nplants, but they are well worth it when time is an object.\r\n\r\nBefore the plants arrive the ground should be thoroughly prepared\r\nby digging and raking until it is in a fine fibrous condition. Mark\r\noff rows four feet apart. When the plants are received, unpack and\r\nwater copiously, and leave in a shady place for twenty-four hours\r\nbefore setting out, at which time make a hole with a trowel a little\r\nlarger than the pot in which the plant has been growing, fill it about\r\nhalf-full of water, and if the plants have been delivered in the pots,\r\nremove carefully by loosening the soil, which is done by pushing a\r\nsmall stick through the drain-hole and turning the pot upside down.\r\nThen slip out the ball of earth, and put it into the hole which you\r\nmade with the trowel. Fill in with the loose earth and the process of\r\nplanting will be complete.\r\n\r\nPlants should be set two feet apart in the rows. If they are strong\r\nand healthy specimens, growth will start almost immediately, so you\r\nmust go carefully through the rows in about two weeks’ time, when the\r\nplants will have commenced to throw out runners. We never allow more\r\nthan four for each plant, and those are trained to root as nearly as\r\npossible before and behind and on each side of the parent plant, which\r\nmakes a solid row about twenty-seven inches wide at the end of the\r\ngrowing season. The best way of insuring runners rooting is to press\r\nthem close to the soil, holding them in place either with a small stone\r\nor a handful of earth.\r\n\r\nAfter growth stops in the fall, the space between the rows should\r\nreceive a dressing of commercial fertiliser and be well spaded over.\r\nAbout December 1st a mulch of straw or leaves should be spread over\r\nthe plants to protect them from the frost. Early the following spring\r\nthe same work is repeated, and about May 1st the mulch is removed from\r\nimmediately around the plants, but left on the ground to keep the\r\nberries from coming in contact with the earth, and also to keep the\r\nsoil moist about the roots. The beds must be kept free from weeds at\r\nall times.\r\n\r\nAfter the crop has been gathered, a few runners are allowed to\r\ndevelop and are rooted in pots, as explained above, to be used in\r\nestablishing new growth later in August, as we always put out six new\r\nrows each season and demolish six old ones, as young plants yield more\r\nand better fruit than old ones. For market the culture cannot be so\r\ncareful, because the size of the beds will necessitate the use of horse\r\ncultivation. What is more, pot plants cost too much.\r\n\r\nThe successful market grower, to whom I have referred previously,\r\npractises the following method: The ground from which early potatoes\r\nhave been harvested is sown with oats and rye, and when that crop is\r\nremoved the following summer the ground is ploughed, harrowed and\r\nmarked off in rows four feet apart, and the plants are taken from the\r\nfield set out the year before.\r\n\r\nWhen the field is planted in June, a man goes through the rows about\r\nAugust and covers the tips of the runners with a little soil, to hold\r\nthem down to the ground. This work is usually done by a man’s foot and\r\na hoe; then, after growth stops in the fall or before it starts the\r\nfollowing spring, the young plants formed from the runners are severed\r\nfrom the parent plant and taken up. This is accomplished by running\r\na one-horse plough along the outside of the rows to cut the runners\r\nand throw out the plants, so making it easy for a man to go along and\r\npick up the strongest plants, which are carried to a trench in some\r\nconvenient location and left until the following June.\r\n\r\nThe trenches are made about six inches deep and the plants are set\r\nabout one inch apart, and the trench refilled. Again a man’s foot\r\nand the hoe do the work. The idea is that severing plants while in a\r\ndormant condition and storing them closely in a trench prevents their\r\nfeeling the shock of removal from the parent stem and retards growth\r\nuntil time to bed. Of course, when they are removed to permanent rows,\r\nthey are planted one foot apart and fields are kept free from weeds by\r\nthe use of a one-horse cultivator between the rows.\r\n\r\nEven in field culture the runners have to be attended to as soon as\r\nthey commence to form. Allowing several to develop from each plant will\r\nmake the row a comparatively solid mass of from fifteen to eighteen\r\ninches wide at the end of the season. A field set out in June or\r\nearly July will give a full crop the following year and be nearly as\r\nproductive the second year if early cultivated and fertilised, but\r\nafter that should be ploughed up and the ground used for potatoes,\r\ncabbage or some other crops before it is again used for strawberries.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which strawberries are to be grown should have been well\r\nenriched with barn-yard manure for previous crops, but commercial\r\nfertiliser should be used while berries hold possession of the\r\nground, for barn-yard manure is apt to contain the spores of fungus\r\ndiseases which attack strawberries. Any sign of these diseases should\r\nbe instantly checked by spraying with Bordeaux mixture. One thing\r\nmore. When purchasing plants, remember that there are what are called\r\nperfect and imperfect plants. The latter are just as good for all\r\npractical purposes if planted side by side with perfect plants, but not\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO GROW SMALL FRUITS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf gathered when ripe, and served at once, berries--in fact, all the\r\nsmall fruits--are undoubtedly luxuries. So the country home should\r\nalways devote some space to them, no matter how small the garden may\r\nbe; and when the home is a farm, expected to become self-supporting,\r\nthe berry orchard should be established immediately after taking\r\npossession, for the outlay is little, returns quick, and necessary\r\nknowledge is very easily acquired. Therefore, small fruits are a\r\npermanent branch of husbandry to be recommended to the amateur of small\r\nmeans, who needs a marketable commodity to keep the pot boiling.\r\n\r\nLike most old farms, our place had a few neglected currant bushes, a\r\npatch of half-wild black and red raspberries, and a strawberry bed in a\r\nmost demoralised condition. But even these poor degenerates convinced\r\nus of the economy of growing small fruits for our own use, and the\r\nprofit to be derived by supplying other people’s tables. Besides\r\nthe luxury of having freshly-gathered fruit, there are preserves,\r\njellies and cordials for winter use. At the end of the first year we\r\nthoroughly pruned and cultivated the old brambles, and planted half\r\nan acre with brambles and black and red currants. Afterward the space\r\nwas enlarged, until we had a good-sized berry orchard, which has\r\nalways shown a profit even in the worst seasons. Brambles will grow\r\nin almost any ground, but if well fed and given a congenial home they\r\nyield much better. The fruit is larger, better coloured and finer\r\nflavoured. So, when possible, select ground that is somewhat sandy in\r\ncharacter, with a heavy subsoil. Ground that has been under cultivation\r\nfor two or three seasons is best, because it will have been well\r\nworked, and so will be comparatively free from weeds. Commence with a\r\nsmall patch, say half an acre, divided equally between black and red\r\nraspberries, blackberries and black and red currants. Strawberries\r\ncannot be included in a general small-fruit orchard, because the beds\r\nare profitable for only three years, and it is better to take them into\r\nregular crop rotation, using ground that has previously been occupied\r\nby potatoes or corn. As space is somewhat limited, we will devote this\r\nchapter to brambles and currants.\r\n\r\nThere are new plants for favour each year in nursery catalogues, but\r\nwe will cover only a few of the old stand-bys, such as the following\r\nlist: Raspberries (red), Columbian and Cuthbert; (black) Gregg and\r\nCumberland; blackberries, Wilson and Taylor; currants, Red Cherry and\r\nFay’s Prolific; gooseberries, Industry and Pearl. The best plan is to\r\npurchase a few dozen plants of each variety from some good nursery for\r\nparent stock, and when they are once well set, do your own propagating\r\nfrom them. Raspberries should be set three feet apart, in rows five\r\nfeet apart. Have the ground well dressed with stable manure, and mark\r\noff in rows. It is best to use a plough for the marking, as you then\r\nhave a furrow about the right depth in which to plant. If the plants\r\nhave travelled far, stand them in a shallow pan or half barrel, and\r\ncover the roots with water for ten or twelve hours before planting.\r\nBrambles that are kept well trimmed need no staking out, but when\r\nplanting young stock it is well to have some stakes cut about four\r\nfeet long and pointed at one end. Drive one every three feet along the\r\nrows, and then set the plant close up to it. Spread out the roots in\r\nthe natural form, and firm the earth well around them, then tie the\r\ncanes loosely to the stake, to prevent the wind from blowing them from\r\nside to side. Unless stakes are used at this time, brambles or small\r\nbushes sway from side to side in every light breeze, and the roots are\r\nloosened, thus preventing them from gaining any hold on the ground.\r\nCultivation should be as thorough and constant as for corn until\r\nAugust, as it is required to keep down weeds and permit growth. After\r\nAugust, cultivation should stop, to check the growth and allow the\r\nsummer wood time to ripen before frost.\r\n\r\nTo those who are new to gardening, the above may need some explanation.\r\nCultivation--by which is meant stirring the surface soil with the\r\ncultivator or garden rake--prevents the moisture from escaping from\r\nthe ground. Moisture releases and brings into consumable form the\r\ndifferent properties of the soil which constitute plant-food. A\r\nbountiful supply of nourishment naturally promotes growth. Stop\r\ncultivation, and food decreases, growth stops, and the tender twigs at\r\nthe extremity of branches have time to harden sufficiently to resist\r\nfrost that would kill new growth.\r\n\r\nPlanting and general care are virtually the same with blackberries.\r\nRaspberries are of a weedy or spreading nature, and throw up new shoots\r\nfrom root beds, which must be kept down between rows, or the patch will\r\nbecome a tangled wilderness within a few years. Even during the first\r\nsummer after setting out it is advisable to top-prune as fresh growth\r\nis made. Don’t allow the canes to grow to a length of more than twenty\r\ninches. The pinching off of the ends forces them to throw out side\r\nbranches and more canes from the main root, a very desirable thing, as\r\nfruit is borne only on the extremity of branches grown the preceding\r\nyear. After the first year all the old canes which have borne fruit\r\nmust be cut out. In winter, when sap has returned to the roots, is the\r\nbest time for this work; but as the amateur may find some difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing the old canes from the new ones, it is safer to do the\r\ndemolishing soon after the fruit has been gathered, when there can be\r\nno mistake. Each fall throw well-rotted stable manure around the roots\r\nof each plant, and fork it into the ground as early in the spring as\r\nthe weather permits. At the same time run the plough between the rows,\r\nto destroy the undesirable root shoots. Blackberries do not form root\r\nbeds that send up new shoots, so the ploughing need not be practised\r\nbetween the rows; otherwise, clearing and pruning are virtually the\r\nsame as for raspberries.\r\n\r\nWhen more plants are required of the raspberry family, allow some of\r\nthe root shoots to develop during the summer, and early the following\r\nspring take them up with a sharp spade, which will sever the connection\r\nbetween the new and the old plant without injury to either. As\r\nblackberries do not throw up new plants in the same way, they must be\r\ncreated from seeds or layers. Allow one or two canes of old plants to\r\ngrow long enough to fall over and reach the ground, and in August peg\r\nthe tops to the ground with a forked stick, and draw up a little mould\r\naround each. They will soon throw out roots and top growth, and early\r\nthe following spring can be cut from the parent branch about eight\r\ninches above the rooted end. Dig up a new plant, and set in rows the\r\nsame as raspberries. All the brambles are very vigorous growers and\r\nremarkably free from disease, but it is advisable to keep a lookout for\r\nthe anthracnose, which is a greyish-looking spot with a purple centre.\r\nThey are most likely to make their appearance in summer on young canes,\r\nand if not checked, multiply and eventually kill the plants. Cut out\r\nany affected canes immediately after discovery, and burn. Spray the\r\nadjacent plants with Bordeaux mixture two or three times, allowing\r\ntwelve or fifteen days between the applications. If old plants are\r\naffected, they don’t need any consideration--take shoots from them.\r\nOrange-rust is the yellowish-looking spot on the under side of the\r\nleaves. The only remedy is to dig up, and cremate, but I truly think,\r\ninstead of talking about cause and cure of occasional diseases, it is\r\nbetter to set out new plants every five or six years, for fresh-grown\r\nyouthful vigour invariably militates disease more than any amount of\r\ndoctoring.\r\n\r\nCurrants, both black and red, should be in every small-fruit orchard;\r\nor if there is no special orchard, a few bushes should be planted in\r\nthe vegetable garden. Bushes should stand five feet apart, in a partly\r\nshady position if possible, and in rich, moist soil. Currant bushes\r\nbear for many years if properly cared for, and in their case pruning\r\nneed not be an annual occurrence, as the same branches will bear for\r\nseveral years; it is advisable, however, to cut out a few of the older\r\nbranches every two or three years, and encourage new growth. Early in\r\nthe spring spray well, and again after the fruit has formed, and yet\r\nagain late in the summer, for borers. This is the worst and commonest\r\nenemy the currant has. It originates from a dark-blue moth with yellow\r\nbands across the body, which lays its eggs on the buds of the outer\r\nbranches. The eggs hatch into small white caterpillars with dark heads.\r\nAfter destroying the appearance of the bush they bore to the centre\r\nof the stems, and remain there until the following year. Much disease\r\nand many insect pests will be averted if all dead leaves are raked up\r\nfrom under the bushes in the late fall, and burned. Mulch around the\r\nbushes in the early winter with stable manure, and fork into the ground\r\nthe following spring. Stock can be increased either by dividing large\r\nbushes, which is really the quickest way, or by taking cuttings. If the\r\nlatter method is followed--and when there are only young bushes on the\r\npremises, it will have to be--take about eight inches off the end of\r\nwell-developed branches of the same season’s growth. Plant them so that\r\nall but the top leaf-bud is under ground. They need not be set more\r\nthan three inches apart, and must be transplanted the following year.\r\nAugust is the best season to take the cuttings, as it gives them time\r\nto form roots before frost. In November protect them slightly with a\r\nmulch of straw or leaves. They should remain in the nursery bed for a\r\nyear before being transplanted again to their permanent position.\r\n\r\nGooseberries are usually picked green and used for pies, but when the\r\nlarge-fruiting varieties are grown they are delicious raw when ripe.\r\nThe soil should be rich, heavy loam well drained. Little pruning is\r\nneeded for the first two or three years beyond the clipping back of the\r\nshoots to develop fruit spurs along the cane, but of course weak or\r\nbroken branches must be removed.\r\n\r\nPropagation is done by suckers and mound layers, though the American\r\nvarieties grow easily from cuttings. To procure strong mound layers,\r\ncut the old bushes back in the late fall or early spring to encourage\r\nnew shoots to spring up from the roots, and when they are from one to\r\ntwo feet high press them outward from the parent plant, covering the\r\nbase of the shoot up to about four inches above the root with earth,\r\npacking it well down. Then in the fall or following spring sever the\r\nshoot from the parent plant and transplant to the permanent home. Let\r\nthem stand about four feet apart each way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO RAISE PERENNIAL PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revival of the old-time hardy garden has become such a craze\r\namong fashionable folk that the country woman who desires to add to\r\nher income will find growing perennial plants for sale a profitable\r\noccupation, provided, remember, that there is a well-to-do community\r\nnear at hand where she may find a ready market.\r\n\r\nLike all occupations which have to do with Nature, it is folly to\r\nattempt it unless you have an innate love of the work, for it requires\r\nthe comprehensive sympathy of a real affinity, as well as technical\r\nknowledge, to rear either plants or animals successfully.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage in raising bedding plants is the small space and\r\ncapital required. A hundred square feet, and two or three dollars\r\nfor seeds, will enable anyone to make a beginning, which can easily\r\nbe worked up into a large business. The correct month for starting\r\nperennials from seed is June, but as that necessitates waiting about\r\nnine months for any returns, I am sure the beginner will agree with me\r\nin thinking it is best to start some in the house or hotbed, for then\r\nthe varieties which flower the first season can be sold in May or June,\r\nand those which don’t flower until the second season will be large,\r\nstrong plants in October, when many people set out hardy plants.\r\n\r\nThe sashes for hotbeds, glazed and painted ready for use, cost only\r\nthree dollars and fifty cents each, and the walls of the beds can\r\nbe made out of any old boards, so they do not add very much to the\r\nexpense of starting, but if you do not care to undertake anything so\r\nprofessional as this at first, it is quite possible to manage with\r\nshallow boxes, if you have a south or southeast window in a room which\r\naverages from sixty to sixty-five degrees.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is getting good potting mould for the seed-beds\r\nor boxes. It must be light and fibrous, a condition best arrived at by\r\nshaving off the under side of grass sods, and mixing with about twice\r\nthe amount of ordinary garden soil and a little fine sand. But as you\r\nare not likely to have a store of sods, and the frozen condition of\r\nthe ground will make it difficult to get them, you must substitute\r\nwell-rotted cow manure. Have ordinary garden soil carried into some\r\nplace warm enough to dissipate all frost, then mix thoroughly with the\r\npulverised manure and sand. Pass through a fine sieve, and it will be\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nEven when the hotbed is used, it is better to have small boxes for the\r\ndifferent varieties of seeds, and stand them in the hotbed, instead of\r\nsowing the seed directly in the bed itself, for some varieties take\r\nlonger than others to germinate, and it is a difficult problem to\r\nventilate and water a bed containing a miscellaneous assortment, but\r\nwhen the seeds are in boxes, they can be removed from the bed during\r\nthe warm part of the day, and the difficulty is militated. Boxes should\r\nbe about two and a half inches deep, and have a few cracks or holes\r\nin the bottom for drainage. Cover the bottom with a layer of coal\r\nashes, then fill to within a quarter of an inch of the top with the\r\npotting-mould. Smooth it off evenly, water and stand in a warm place.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days there will be a crop of weed seedlings. Demolish\r\nthem, rewater and allow a few days to elapse on the chance of a second\r\ncrop appearing, after which it will be safe to do the planting. It is\r\na good scheme to use a flour or powdered-sugar shaker for very small\r\nseeds, instead of trying to sow them by hand. When seeds are large\r\nenough to handle individually, like hollyhocks, push them into the soil\r\nwith the point of a pencil or a wooden-skewer, half an inch apart in\r\nrows one inch apart.\r\n\r\nAfter the seeds have been placed, scatter mould over them. The amount\r\nhas to be determined by the size of the seeds. The general rule is,\r\ntwice their own depth; but with the very minute varieties it is better\r\nto put no covering at all.\r\n\r\nNo matter what the depth of covering, the soil must be pressed firmly\r\ndown with a smooth piece of board, cut to fit inside the box. A\r\ndesk-blotter or roller is very convenient, and does the work very\r\nevenly. Do not be afraid to press down firmly. The seeds must be\r\nclosely imbedded in the soil, otherwise the air will dry up the first\r\nfrail sprouts and kill them. After the rolling and pressing, sprinkle\r\nwith water, then cover with a piece of glass or paper, and stand in the\r\nhotbed or window.\r\n\r\nCovering the boxes with glass or paper is done to retard evaporation.\r\nSeeds must never be allowed to dry out during the time of germination;\r\nwatering is so likely to disturb the soil around them that it is to be\r\navoided if possible, but if it has to be done, use a very fine rose on\r\nthe sprinkler, warm water and be very careful.\r\n\r\nAfter the seedlings appear, remove the covering, and when the second\r\nleaves have developed, transplant into fresh boxes if you are depending\r\non window culture. If you have a hotbed, they can be set in rows from\r\none to two inches apart, according to the size of the plants.\r\n\r\nDuring the bright warm days the sash of the hotbed should be raised or\r\nentirely removed, but be very watchful of the weather. Spring is such a\r\ntreacherous time of year that the warm mornings may develop into frosty\r\nafternoons. Always replace the sash over the hotbed by three o’clock\r\nin the afternoon, and cover with mats before dusk. As soon as the\r\nground is in condition for the outside nursery beds, dig and thoroughly\r\ncultivate, for the plants which are to be held over for fall sales must\r\nbe bedded out as soon as all fear of frost is past, and seeds sown for\r\nthe next year’s stock.\r\n\r\nThe seed-beds in the open ground must be well prepared and made\r\nvery fine and fibrous. Sow the seeds in rows and transplant as with\r\nthe house seedlings. Beds must all be kept free from weeds and under\r\ngood cultivation during the growing season. When severe weather comes\r\nin the fall, cover lightly with leaves or soil, and the plants will\r\nwinter safely and be ready for spring sales the following year. The\r\nhouse-raised seedlings which are to be sold for this year’s bedding can\r\ngo into garden beds, but it is really better to put them into small\r\nindividual pots, which should be partly submerged in soil or sand.\r\nCustomers will usually pay a few cents extra for pot-plants.\r\n\r\nThere is such an endless variety of perennial plants that it is\r\nimpossible to grow them all; in fact, it would be very foolish to\r\ntry to do so. Select the best-known and most popular kinds, and have\r\nsome of different sizes, so that you can make up selections for beds.\r\nHollyhocks, foxgloves, golden glow, monk’s-hood all range from three\r\nand a half to five feet in height. After them come phlox, larkspur,\r\nfalse dragon’s-head, Canterbury bells and bergamot. A step lower are\r\nbleeding-heart, columbine, leopard’s-bane, asters, sweet-williams and\r\nwallflowers. Still lower are Iceland poppies, Japanese primroses,\r\nwake-robin and pansies.\r\n\r\nThe first year it would add to your profit to grow a few of the\r\nannual varieties in the hotbed collection: Hollyhocks, sweet sultans,\r\nsweet tobacco, asters, wallflowers, mignonette and salvia. Among the\r\nperennials which will flower the first season if seed is sown in boxes\r\nor hotbeds, are monk’s-hood (which is one of the most charming of the\r\ntall blue flowers and comes also in white, and blue-white mixed);\r\nlarkspur; Chinese bellflower (large bell-shaped flowers of steel blue,\r\nwhite and violet); heliotrope and marshmallows (pink, rose colour,\r\nwhite with crimson spots, and golden yellow with maroon centres)--these\r\nare amongst the most valuable of the first-year bloomers, for they\r\nflower all through the summer. Three of the most fragrant annuals are\r\nsweet tobacco, sweet sultan and mignonette.\r\n\r\nSweet-williams are such old favourites, and are so multicoloured that\r\nI have always been thankful that they flowered the first season.\r\nMeadow-sweet--or goat’s-beard, as it is often called--is white and\r\nfragrant. Blanket-flower grows about two feet high, and has most\r\ngorgeous flowers, dark velvety brown marked with blotches of crimson.\r\nOf course, all the varieties suggested for early house-culture should\r\nalso be sown in the open ground in June to produce a plentiful supply\r\nof strong plants for the following year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNE ROSES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE ROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first luxury we allowed ourselves on the farm was a collection of\r\nroses. We had put aside a sum of money for some necessary repairs,\r\nand when they were completed there were six dollars left, which we\r\nagreed to spend on the garden. One dollar went for perennial seeds,\r\nanother for wistaria root. The remaining four were devoted to roses.\r\nWe sent for an advertised collection of hardy roses, consisting of\r\nsix two-year-old plants for one dollar and twenty cents, two Crimson\r\nRamblers at fifty cents each and two Dorothy Perkins at fifty cents\r\napiece, a collection for winter forcing, which were only little\r\nseedlings, and cost forty cents. Lastly, a two-year-old moss rose\r\nwas added, which also cost forty cents. Since that time, several\r\ntwo-year-olds of specially desired varieties have been bought, but the\r\npurchases made with that four dollars really constituted the stock from\r\nwhich we have populated our own and many other gardens.\r\n\r\nThe first year the Dorothy Perkins covered about twelve square feet\r\nof sidewall, and all but the winter collection and one of the others\r\nflowered the first season. One hundred slips were taken, and eighty-two\r\nlived. Twenty were sold the following season at ten cents each. The\r\nsecond year one hundred were sold at five cents each to a local store,\r\nand three dozen at ten cents to odd customers. The winter collection\r\nwas not allowed to flower until the second winter; then they were put\r\ninto the violet-house, where they did quite well, but as we had neither\r\ntime nor desire to undertake any more hothouse work, we never made any\r\nattempt to increase the stock or make any sales. However, rose-growing\r\nfor the winter market is carried on quite extensively in our vicinity,\r\nso I have had ample proof of the profit to be derived from the work\r\nwhen undertaken as a business. But truly, I think growing garden plants\r\nis almost as profitable, and most certainly it is a much easier and\r\nhealthier branch of the work. Moreover, it does not require capital,\r\nnor the knowledge required for hothouse culture.\r\n\r\nThe best soil for roses is that which is rich in vegetable matter, such\r\nas sod, roots and fallen leaves which have been exposed to the action\r\nof the elements long enough to disintegrate and melt into the soil. It\r\nis the condition found in the ground cover of woods and forests, and it\r\ncan be simulated at home by means of a compost heap. Old sods, leaves\r\nand all waste vegetable matter are piled up with alternate layers of\r\ngarden soil, allowed to remain for several months, then thoroughly\r\nforked and repiled. When it is wanted for use, pass through a coarse\r\nsieve, and mix with one-half its own bulk of cow manure.\r\n\r\nIf your garden soil is not very good, dig large holes two feet square\r\nand deep. Then fill up with the home-made compost, or soil from the\r\nwoods, and old cow manure. When the young plants come from the nursery,\r\nunpack and stand the roots in water. If the ground should not be\r\nready, or any other cause compels delay in planting, add rich soil\r\nto the water in which the plants are standing, until it is about the\r\nconsistency of mud, and keep in that condition until the plants can be\r\nset in their permanent positions out of doors.\r\n\r\nMake a hole in the middle of the filled-in space large enough to permit\r\nof the roots being spread out to their full capacity. Never squeeze\r\nplants into a small hole, which necessitates the doubling under of\r\nroots. This applies to all plants as well as roses. After the roots\r\nhave been spread out evenly in the hole, scatter soil over them to the\r\ndepth of two inches; then water copiously, and after the water has been\r\nabsorbed by the soil, fill up with dry earth and firm down thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWatering in the middle of the filling-in operation washes the soil\r\ninto all the crevices around the rootlets, and insures a supply of\r\nmoisture around the plants. Putting in the dry earth above it prevents\r\nevaporation, so that the roots have valuable food while they are\r\nrecovering their hold on Mother Earth.\r\n\r\nAnother point to remember in setting out roots is that an eastern or\r\nnorthern exposure is to be preferred to a southern exposure, as the\r\nmorning sun is better for them than the strong noon-day glare. Keep\r\nthe ground as clean and well-cultivated as around tender annuals.\r\n\r\nNow we come to the question of food for this gluttonous beauty. Get a\r\nstrong barrel and stand it on blocks to raise it to about the height\r\nof a pail above the ground, then tack the mouth of an ordinary burlap\r\nbag securely around the top of the barrel, so that the bottom of the\r\nbag falls to within one inch of the bottom of the barrel. Insert a\r\ncommon tap just above the lowest hoop, then empty two pailfuls of fresh\r\ncow-droppings into the bag, and pour water over it until the barrel is\r\nfull. Let it stand two or three days before using. Dose: Three quarts\r\nof the liquid for each plant every two weeks, from the time they show\r\nlife in the spring until September.\r\n\r\nHybrid teas are the variety best adapted to garden culture. They\r\nembrace some of our most beautiful roses, are perfectly hardy and\r\nflower throughout the summer. To this class belong all the Killarney\r\nand Lyon family; La France, Viscountess Folkestone, Mrs. Aaron Ward,\r\nHarry Kirk and about one hundred others. In order to insure free\r\nflowering none must be allowed to fade on the bush. Keep a close watch,\r\nand cut the moment the petals show any sign of withering. Allow long\r\nstalks, as it is the most natural way of pruning these plants and\r\ninsures a supply lasting until frost.\r\n\r\nCrimson Ramblers I have discarded entirely, for their blossoming period\r\nis short, and their foliage is not attractive. Dorothy Perkins and\r\nHiawatha both grow rapidly and are better in every respect.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I bought one plant of the new German climber, Thousand\r\nBeauties, which is rightly named, for it is a mass of blossom, and it\r\nis like having twenty plants in one, as it bears flowers of all shades,\r\nfrom white to deep crimson. It was a constant wonder and delight the\r\nwhole of last summer and made quite as much growth as any of the other\r\nclimbers, so I really think it is worth a place in any collection.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, all bushes are given a conservative pruning, by which\r\nI mean that only some of the old wood is removed--not all--and that\r\nthe rampant young growth is cut back to about half its length. After\r\nthe ground is frozen, a heavy covering of cow manure is put around\r\nthe plants at a distance of two or three feet, according to the size\r\nof the bush, and at Christmas-time, before the really severe weather\r\ncomes, fallen leaves are spread over that, and a few cedar branches, to\r\nprevent their being blown away. In the spring, as soon as the ground\r\ncan be worked, the manure and leaves are worked into the soil, and any\r\nbranches which have been winter-killed are cut off.\r\n\r\nOur collection has been enlarged entirely through cuttings. I cut\r\noff about six inches from the end of branches, close to a bud. These\r\ncuttings are allowed to stand in water for two or three days, then\r\nplanted in shallow boxes filled with moist, rich soil, and kept in\r\na light, warm cellar, where the temperature averages about fifty\r\ndegrees. The following year they are planted out into nursery beds\r\nuntil August, when they are set out in their permanent homes. Last\r\nsummer I transplanted ten straight from the cellar into a garden bed,\r\nand by July they were two and a half feet high, and bore from four to\r\nseven blossoms each from August to September 15th, when we had a hard,\r\nfrosty night, which checked all development.\r\n\r\nIf cuttings are intended for winter forcing, proceed as before until\r\nthe second spring, then transplant into pots, which should be plunged\r\nto the rim in the ground.\r\n\r\nAbout once a week turn the pots around, to prevent any roots which may\r\nforce their way through the bottom of the pot from getting a hold on\r\nthe ground. At the same time nip off any flower buds which may appear.\r\nFeed well, to promote growth, and about July have the benches in the\r\nhothouse filled up with rich soil, to which has been added a goodly\r\npercentage of silver sand. Remove the plants from the pots, and set out\r\nabout fifteen inches apart. Of course, the fire must not be started in\r\nthe heating apparatus, and all windows and doors must be kept open, so\r\nthat the plants have plenty of air, and during the hot, close days,\r\nthey should be lightly sprayed three or four times a day. After the\r\nfirst of September there is danger of frost, so it is best to close\r\nthe windows at night, but the principal desire is to keep the plants\r\ncool to permit their growth until the fires are lighted and forcing\r\nreally begins, which should be about October. When the fires are first\r\nlighted, keep the temperature down to about fifty-five degrees,\r\nincrease slowly to sixty-five, then to seventy.\r\n\r\nWatering is a great problem, and nothing but practice can really teach\r\nyou the exact proportions. The only general instruction is: The plant\r\nmust never be allowed to dry out, nor must it ever be too wet. A spray\r\nfor green fly and other insects should be used in the evening, once or\r\ntwice a week, from the time the plants are taken from the garden into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER AND HERBS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere should be an herb bed in every garden, for their usefulness is\r\nmanifold. Ye dames of olden times knew and estimated their value,\r\nbut when housewifery was metamorphosed into domestic science, the\r\ntraditional law of our grandmothers sank into derision, and many\r\nfactors of homey comfort might forever have been buried in oblivion had\r\nnot some wise person started a craze for old furniture. That aroused a\r\ngeneral interest in the old-time housewifery, and resulted in a revival\r\nof half-forgotten arts, the hardy garden and herb bed being among them.\r\n\r\nI spent most of my schoolday holidays at my grandmother’s place in\r\nYorkshire, England, where many of the customs of Queen Anne’s time\r\nremain unchanged. So to me lavender and herbs seemed indispensable\r\nin a self-respecting household, and as soon as I owned a garden they\r\nwere installed. Perhaps you never experienced the delight of sleeping\r\nbetween sheets redolent of sweet herbs, so don’t know what you are\r\nmissing. At grandmother’s, sheer muslin bags were filled with lavender,\r\nthyme and rosemary, and kept in every cupboard, bureau drawer and\r\nchest. Large jars filled with rose-leaves and mignonette, all the herbs\r\nand many spices were stowed in the sitting-rooms and halls, and the\r\nlids were removed for about half an hour after sweeping and dusting\r\nwere completed, so a faint, indescribable perfume permeated the whole\r\nhouse, and was most delightful. Punk sticks and pastils have such a\r\npositive odour that after a time one becomes very tired of them, but\r\nherbal odours, being delicate and indescribable, merely suggest the\r\nfreshness of meadow lands in June, and invigorate the senses instead of\r\nwearying.\r\n\r\nThe herb then is invaluable for all sorts of complexion and hair\r\nwashes. Even Helen of Troy’s beauty was attributed to their use. As\r\ndisinfectants--well, the plague was supposed to be banished from Athens\r\nby the air being purified with aromatic herbs, and during the great\r\nplague in England in Elizabeth’s time, little balls of perfume paste\r\nencased in silver, gold or ivory, open-worked lockets or pomades were\r\nworn suspended round the neck or carried in the pockets, and during an\r\noutbreak of smallpox, grandmamma brought forth several such inherited\r\ntreasures and filled them with a compound made of beeswax, herbs and\r\nspices, and we all wore them in the old way. What influence they\r\nexercised over the dreaded disease I do not pretend to gauge, but we\r\nall escaped. Separate or mingled fate and superstition has made me use\r\nsuch compounds whenever travelling or knowingly exposed to infection.\r\nEven medical men don’t deny the benefit of sweet odours, or their value\r\nas disinfectants, so why should not we enjoy the undoubted pleasure\r\nwhen it only means a few packages of seeds and a little trouble.\r\n\r\nLavender is hardy when it is once firmly established, but it is not\r\nthe easiest perennial to start in this country. At first I bought\r\nnursery stock, but out of two dozen plants which I got from four\r\ndifferent sources during two years, only one lived, and that was\r\nalways a semi-invalid, so I resorted to the slower method of sowing\r\nseed. In March, a shallow box was filled with potting mould thoroughly\r\nsoaked with water, then covered with about one-fourth of an inch of\r\nsoil, patted down firmly, the box covered with glass, and placed in\r\na west window. As soon as seedlings appeared the glass was removed,\r\nbut they were shaded from the direct sun and slightly sprinkled every\r\nmorning. When two inches high they were transplanted to a deeper box\r\nand set two inches apart. About two months later they were transplanted\r\nto a partly-shaded seed-bed in the garden, and the last two leaves\r\nwere nipped off each plant to insure a bushy growth. Cultivation was\r\nconstant all through the summer until August, when they were again\r\ntransplanted--this time into a bed which was to be their permanent\r\nhome--a border partly shaded by shrubs. It happened to be a very dry\r\nsummer, so they were sprinkled every evening. When cool weather set in,\r\nleaves were scattered between the plants, and the quantity increased as\r\nthe weather became more severe. In the spring the mulch was removed,\r\nand a little bone meal raked into the ground around the plants. The\r\nground must be covered every winter, and it is well to have a dressing\r\nof well-rotted cow manure dug into the bed during the early fall.\r\n\r\nIn June or July we always have huge quantities of flowers. We have\r\nnever marketed any of them, but they have formed the basis of many\r\nChristmas and birthday presents. Ten pounds of lavender flowers, and\r\none pound each of musk, thyme, rosemary and mint leaves, all dried, and\r\nmixed with one ounce of ground cloves, was grandmamma’s formula for\r\nmoth-bags which preserved our furs and woollens just as effectually as\r\ncamphor balls or tar mixtures.\r\n\r\nSage is needed for pork, duck and goose dressings, and is one of the\r\nvery best tonics for the hair: the broad leaf variety is the best to\r\ngrow. It will save time to buy the plants; they only cost ten cents\r\neach, are very easy to establish, and quite hardy. Three plants will\r\nbe sufficient for a home supply. Set out three feet apart in a partly\r\nshaded situation. There are two varieties of thyme; both should find\r\na place in the garden, the broad leaf English in the herb-bed for\r\nflavoring stews and soups; the almond-scented in the flower garden,\r\nfor it is a pretty variegated plant which remains green all through\r\nthe year, and is used only for sachets and potpourri. Both varieties\r\nare perennials, but if sown early in the spring will mature the first\r\nseason. The seed should be sown in rows nine inches apart, on rich soil\r\nwhich has been worked into a fine, loose condition, with a fine garden\r\nrake, and later smoothed off with a board or the back of a spade. Mark\r\nthe rows by pressing the edge of a board on to the ground. Don’t make\r\na furrow, as the seed is very small. Next, sprinkle thoroughly, using\r\na fine rose on the water-can. Keep the can moving back and forth until\r\nthe ground is thoroughly saturated to the depth of an inch. Wait for an\r\nhour, then scatter the seed thinly on the marked lines, and cover about\r\nthe sixteenth of an inch with dry, fine soil. It is a good plan to fill\r\nthe flour-dredger with soil, and shake it over the rows, for then you\r\nare sure of its being evenly distributed. After the seed is covered,\r\nput a board over the row, and press gently, to insure the seeds being\r\nfirmed into the ground.\r\n\r\nThyme, marjoram--in fact, all small seeds--do better if they are\r\npartly shaded. I make long, narrow frames of slats, and cover them\r\nwith unbleached muslin, then drive a few sticks into each side of the\r\nrow, and lay the frames over them. For safety against wind-storms, it\r\nis well to put a few nails through the frames into the sticks. About\r\neleven o’clock it is advisable to sprinkle the muslin over the frames\r\nwith water, as the evaporation prevents the seedlings becoming too dry.\r\nIf time won’t permit making the frames, spread two or three thicknesses\r\nover the rows, using stones to hold them in place, or mulch with lawn\r\nclippings. I like the former the best, because they are easy to remove,\r\nand are not so untidy as a grass mulch, which dries and blows about.\r\n\r\nWhen the seedlings are well established--which is when they have got\r\ntheir second pair of leaves and are an inch high--the mulch will have\r\nto be removed, but if the frames are used, they can remain for another\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nRosemary is another perennial, and the plants can easily be got from\r\nany nursery, but if you want to raise some seed, proceed exactly as for\r\nthyme. After you have one well-grown plant, it is better to propagate\r\nby cutting than to raise from seed. They require rich soil, and a\r\nsunny position, and need some light protection during the winter. The\r\nwhole plant is aromatic, but the flowers are the strongest. It is\r\nthe essential oil which is distilled from them that is the principal\r\ningredient of eau de cologne. A cupful each of lavender, thyme,\r\nrosemary and mint, steeped in two quarts of hot water for two hours,\r\nstrained and added to a warm bath, banishes fatigue in a miraculous\r\nway, and in cases of long convalescence, a cupful of the mixture in the\r\nsponge bath is most gratifying and refreshing to the invalid.\r\n\r\nSummer savory is an annual. It must be sown in shallow drills nine\r\ninches apart, in early summer. Sweet marjoram is a perennial, and\r\nshould receive the same culture as lavender. Both are used for\r\nflavouring, stuffings and soups. Bane, saffron and wormwood belong to\r\nthe poultry department principally. The first are annuals, the last\r\nperennial. Borage is an annual which gives just the piquant fillip to\r\nsalads and summer drinks which epicures delight in, and bees simply\r\nadore it. Plant in dry, sandy soil. Dill and tarragon must not be\r\nleft out of the herb collection, for they improve the pickles, and\r\nare necessary for many sauces. They are both annuals of easy culture,\r\nand will grow in any garden. Sow in rows ten inches apart, and thin\r\nwhen plants get second leaves. To make tarragon vinegar, gather a pint\r\nof the young sprigs, wash, and pour two quarts of malt vinegar over\r\nthem. Let it stand two or three weeks, strain, and if not quite strong\r\nenough, add fresh sprigs. Strain after two weeks, and bottle for use.\r\n\r\nSpearmint requires moist soil. We grow it in large quantities, as we\r\nhave a good market for it at five cents a bunch during the spring\r\nand summer. It is positively no trouble after it is introduced into\r\ncongenial soil, for it spreads rapidly, and needs no cultivation beyond\r\nthe cutting what is necessary for market.\r\n\r\nDon’t make the mistake of transplanting the common wild mint, for\r\nusually the flavour is more like peppermint than spearmint, which is\r\nthe variety demanded for sauces. We bought three plants originally,\r\nwhich cost fifteen cents each, and now it covers about fifty feet of\r\none side of the back garden, where the ground is moist and shaded by\r\nsome old quince trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWING WATERCRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWatercress is in constant demand the year round in the markets of all\r\nlarge cities, so it is a salable crop which should especially appeal\r\nto the commuter class of farmers, as it must be freshly gathered to be\r\nat its best, and naturally cannot be shipped long distances to market,\r\nwhich is perhaps the principal reason for its being such a profitable\r\ncrop. In France and England, watercress farms are quite numerous,\r\nespecially in the vicinity of Paris and London; but in this country\r\nit is only just beginning to be cultivated to any great extent, the\r\nprincipal market supply being furnished by Italians who take short\r\njourneys into the country and gather it from the ponds and streams\r\nwhere it grows wild. Under such circumstances it is not surprising that\r\nthe leaves of poisonous water plants are often found in bunches offered\r\nfor sale in the public markets. We have supplied our egg customers\r\nand one hotel with cress for four years, and never received less than\r\nfive cents a bunch--usually ten cents--and from November to March from\r\ntwelve to fifteen cents for a good-sized bunch.\r\n\r\nLike a good many of the side lines which have brought grist to our\r\nmill, it developed from an apparent accident. There was a large wild\r\nbed in the stream which ran through the lower meadows, from which we\r\ngathered cress during the spring and summer. Chancing down a wagon-road\r\none day in January, we were astonished to see lots of fresh green\r\nsprigs growing under the meagre shelter of a low log bridge which\r\ncrossed the brook. We accepted the hint, and determined to protect\r\nenough of the brook the following year to supply us with fresh salad\r\nthrough the winter. Some time in October, brush was piled up for a\r\ndistance of about six feet on each side of the stream. In November,\r\nwhen the nights commenced to be really cold, we made some frames out of\r\nthin cedar poles, interlaced them with strong cedar branches, and then\r\nplaced them over the stream, with the ends resting on the brush, which\r\nelevated them about nine inches above the cress. Though primitive, the\r\narrangement proved beyond doubt that forcing watercress was practicable.\r\n\r\nDuring that winter we often put a little cress around the poultry which\r\nwas being shipped to private customers, and so many requests came for\r\na regular supply that we concluded it would pay to increase the beds.\r\nBut as the stream was some distance from the house, and accessible to\r\nthe cows when they were in the lower pasture, we resolved to utilize\r\nthe escape from the spring-house, which was never failing. It had up\r\nto that time been carried off by a tile-drain under the side lawn.\r\nOperations were commenced by digging a ditch three feet wide, one foot\r\ndeep. At first it was only made fifty feet long; subsequently it was\r\nincreased to one hundred feet. As the ground was heavy clay, we carted\r\nclean sand from a bank at the other end of the farm, and covered the\r\nbottom of the ditch to the depth of three inches to form a seed-bed,\r\nand also to militate the usual creepy-crawly brook creatures.\r\n\r\nAt every five feet of the ditch, sluices were inserted--just box-like\r\narrangements, made out of rough boards, one of which could be raised\r\nand lowered at will, so that the amount of water in each five-foot\r\nsection would be under control. When the ditch and sluices were\r\ncompleted, a trap divided through the middle was put in front of the\r\nescape from the spring-house to divide the flow of water, and one\r\nlength of the tile at each end of the trap carried it to the opposite\r\nsides of the ditch to insure even distribution.\r\n\r\nIt is a special stone building, twelve feet square, used for milk and\r\nbutter. The floor is about three feet below the ground, and a gutter,\r\nfourteen inches wide and twelve inches deep, runs all round the four\r\nsides, and is kept continually full of cold running water from a spring\r\nsituated about three feet to the right of the house. The water is\r\ndivided by a stone as it enters the house, and goes to the right or\r\nleft in the gutter until it reaches the escape at the opposite side\r\nof the house. The floor and gutter are made of stone, so the place is\r\nbeautifully clean and very like an old-country dairy.\r\n\r\nAfter the beds had been thoroughly saturated with water, all but the\r\nmerest dribble was shut off. Roots from the meadow brook were taken up,\r\nwashed carefully in fresh water to remove the before-mentioned creepy\r\ncreatures, and then set out in the sand at the bottom of the ditch.\r\nField stones were placed on the roots of each plant to prevent their\r\nbeing dislodged by the action of the water before they had had time to\r\nestablish an anchorage. After two weeks the whole supply of water was\r\nallowed to run into the ditch, and it covered the bottom to a depth of\r\nfive inches.\r\n\r\nFully one-half the plants died and had to be replanted, but the\r\nfollowing year the entire ditch was a solid mass of cress. The leaves\r\nwere much larger, and the flavour much better, than the cress had ever\r\nbeen in its wild state. Of course, if the best price was to be obtained\r\nin the winter, our desire was to force the crop at that season. We\r\nbuilt sides fifteen inches deep to the ditch, using rough slabs, which\r\nonly cost us fifty cents a load from the sawmill in the woods. Then we\r\nused the ordinary cold-frame sash over the top.\r\n\r\nAfter the beds are once established, their cultivation consists in\r\ncutting, and nothing else; and, as the cutting is necessary for\r\nthe market supply, it is really truer to call it harvesting than\r\ncultivating; though neglecting to cut the beds regularly as soon as\r\nthey are four inches high will ruin a bed very rapidly, as the plants\r\ngrow thick-stemmed and sprawly.\r\n\r\nWe find that old beds as a rule are not as profitable as young ones,\r\nso we make a practice of renewing three or four sections every year.\r\nThe method is to withhold water in July until the plants die, then pull\r\nthem up, after which the bottom of the ditch is dug over to let in the\r\nair and sweeten the ground. After a lapse of two or three days, it\r\nis raked down level again, and a few loads of fresh sand spread over\r\nthe bottom, saturated with water as before, though, instead of old\r\nroots, we now use slips three inches long, taken from the ends of old\r\nbranching plants. They root very quickly, and make better plants than\r\nthe old roots.\r\n\r\nTwice we have started an entirely new stock from the seed, and think\r\nthe result quite worthy of the extra trouble. The seed is very light\r\nand small, so it is best to start it in shallow pans filled with sand,\r\nwhich must, of course, be kept saturated with water, but not submerged.\r\n\r\nMay or June is the best season for this planting, for then plants\r\nare large enough to transplant into beds in July, and will be well\r\nestablished before the forcing season.\r\n\r\nFor a small home supply through the winter, half-barrels or wash-tubs\r\nmay be used. Half fill them with sandy soil and stand in a light, warm\r\ncellar. Set slips four inches apart in August, and keep perpetually\r\nmoist. If you have no means of getting slips, buy seed from any good\r\nseedsman. Start in shallow pans in June.\r\n\r\nI saw an item in a paper, not long ago, which estimated that an acre\r\nof watercress, at its present market prices, would bring from four to\r\nfive hundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\nWatercress should be carefully prepared for market. Gather and bunch\r\nat once, to prevent unnecessary handling. Cut the stalks evenly after\r\nthe bunches are tied up, and pack in light crates lined with hay or\r\nmoss. Place bunches closely together in rows, with hay or moss between\r\nlayers. Ship on late trains if they have to go by express, to avoid\r\nexposure to the heat of the sun during transit. When small quantities\r\nare going to private customers, pack in strawberry or grape boxes, as\r\nthere is less likelihood of the cress heating and spoiling when packed\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned hive was so inconvenient and wasteful that many\r\npeople who date their knowledge of bee-keeping from the old homestead\r\nwill find it difficult to believe that apiculture has developed into a\r\npractical, money-making industry during the last twenty years, until\r\nnow the average amount of honey put on the market each year is upward\r\nof a hundred million pounds, representing a money value of from eight\r\nto ten million dollars.\r\n\r\nIn a favourable locality one hive, with its average colony of\r\nthirty-five thousand workers and a queen, will turn out from thirty to\r\nforty pounds, besides the fifteen or twenty necessary to feed the hive\r\nthrough the winter.\r\n\r\nThe vicious temper of the old-time black bee has much to do with the\r\nneglect of this profitable industry. The Italian bees are, however, so\r\nmuch better as honey-gatherers that they are almost universally kept\r\nnow, and are so gentle in disposition that even a nervous person can\r\neasily learn to manipulate them without fear of stings.\r\n\r\nThe principal honey-producing plants in our Eastern states are fruit\r\nbloom of all kinds, locust, white clover, crimson clover, basswood,\r\nsumac, goldenrod, buckwheat, sunflowers, grapes and asters. Of these,\r\nclover, basswood and buckwheat provide the bulk of our honey crop\r\nin most localities, although large yields are often obtained from\r\nothers. Fruit bloom, though yielding much honey, comes so early in\r\nthe season that it is mostly consumed by the bees in brood-rearing.\r\nClover commences the last of May, lasts several weeks, and yields a\r\nlight-coloured honey of fine flavour. Basswood blooms the first part of\r\nJuly, lasts about ten days, and produces a very white honey. Buckwheat\r\nblooms in August and the first part of September. It gives a dark-red\r\nhoney with a strong flavour.\r\n\r\nMy apiary started with three hives, bought for two dollars at a farm\r\nauction. I knew nothing about bees or hives at the time; the owner was\r\nnot there to be questioned, so it was a truly risky proceeding, not\r\nto be recommended. But if chance makes it possible to pick up one or\r\ntwo good hives of the box, movable-frame style, and bees of any sort\r\nfor a few dollars, take them and improve the stock by introducing good\r\nItalian queens, which can be bought for two dollars and fifty cents\r\neach from any bee-supply house. They can be shipped through the mail in\r\nsmall cages.\r\n\r\nWhen an Italian queen is introduced into a hive of common bees in\r\nMay or June there will be no sign of the original occupants in the\r\nfall. For the working bees are such indefatigable toilers that during\r\nblossom-time they usually wear themselves out in about six weeks, and\r\nmost certainly never survive more than twelve. The drones are driven\r\nfrom the hive to die whenever any of the different blossom crops\r\nwhich supply honey are on the decline. Queens live for years, but as\r\nperpetuators of their race are only to be relied upon for three years.\r\n\r\nIf your immediate neighbourhood cannot furnish stock to start with, the\r\nbest plan is to send for frames of nuclei and a queen. One frame would\r\ncost three dollars, and hardly contains sufficient bees to build up a\r\nstrong colony, therefore it is better to send for three frames, which\r\nwill make a splendid start, and only cost an additional one dollar and\r\nfifty cents. If purchased in June or July they will have multiplied\r\nso considerably by the time buckwheat is in blossom that you will be\r\nable to build up a second colony. Of course, a hive filled with a full\r\ncomplement of bees can be bought, but would cost at least ten dollars.\r\nExpress charges would be very expensive, as bees come under the head of\r\nlive creatures, and double rates must be paid. The frames of nuclei are\r\npacked in light cases which cost less than half.\r\n\r\nA hive must be ready to receive the little travellers on their arrival,\r\nand here again it is advisable to consider express charges. One hive\r\nready for use will cost two dollars and sixty cents, and almost as much\r\nexpressage as five hives “in the flat,” as dealers call it, and the\r\nfive hives can be had for nine dollars and twenty-five cents. Nails\r\nof the correct size and full instructions are sent with the hive, so\r\neven a feminine amateur will find it quite easy to put them together.\r\nI use two-story, dovetailed hives, which consist of a cover, bottom,\r\nbrood-chamber and two supers. Bees are best kept in a quiet corner of\r\nthe garden, or under the trees in the orchard, where they are protected\r\nfrom the noon-day sun and east winds. When we had only two or three\r\nhives they stood on a shelf in an open-fronted shelter, which was made\r\nfrom a large packing-case bought from the general store for twenty\r\ncents. In the winter we packed straw or leaves around the hives, and\r\nset up boards in front, which leaned against the top of the case,\r\nand sloped out a few inches at the ground. This was to keep out the\r\nsnow and rain and yet allow plenty of ventilation. Now that hives are\r\nscattered through the orchard, we simply slip each into a case a little\r\nlarger than itself, and set up a board in front. Further south no\r\nprotection will be required, but in the North it would be advisable to\r\ncarry the hives into a dry, well-ventilated cellar for the winter. The\r\nonly drawback to the latter plan is that the bees may become restless\r\nquite early in the spring, so the condition of hives should be watched.\r\n\r\nA small hand-mirror held at the opening of the hive, and a light held\r\nin the other hand so that it will shine into the hive, will enable you\r\nto see what is going on inside. If the bees appear restless, it is a\r\nsure sign that they need more air. Opening the cellar windows after\r\ndark on a moderate night will usually supply all the ventilation that\r\nis necessary, until the middle or end of March, when it is best to let\r\nthe bees have a cleansing flight if they still appear restless. It is\r\nnot very much trouble, when only a few hives are kept, to carry them\r\nout on a warm day and place them where they stood last fall. It should\r\nbe done early in the morning and as carefully as possible, so as not\r\nto disturb the inmates, who will gradually arouse as the sun gains\r\nstrength, and take flight. This will relieve the intestines of the\r\nwaste matter which has caused their restlessness. After the sun has\r\ngone down in the evening, carry the hives back into the cellar, and the\r\nbees will be quiet until spring is sufficiently advanced to warrant\r\nputting them out for the season, which is usually when soft maples and\r\nwillows commence to furnish pollen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the days are warm in spring we go through the hives and give\r\nthem a general clean-up. If a hive appears to be short of honey, a comb\r\nfrom a hive that is well supplied is removed and given to it, and as\r\nsome bees are sure to have died during the winter, some colonies will\r\nbe stronger than others, so things must be evened up. When a hive has\r\nmore than five frames filled with brood, one or two are taken out and\r\nplaced in hives having less than five frames filled with brood. A great\r\nadvantage of the modern frame-hive is this being able to take out and\r\nput in brood, and later add supers and empty sections as the original\r\nones are filled with honey.\r\n\r\nA bee’s life is apparently a most accurately prearranged existence,\r\nfilled with allotted duties, which are intuitively understood and\r\nunerringly performed. There is only one queen allowed in each colony,\r\nand she lays all the eggs, the workers being imperfectly-developed\r\nfemales. Drones are the masculine members of the population, lazy\r\nfellows, whom the workers have to feed, hence the reason for their\r\nbeing expelled from the hive whenever food is scarce.\r\n\r\nThe queen is truly a royal personage, who only leaves the hive to take\r\nwhat is called the nuptial flight, when she meets some drone in midair,\r\nand returns to become the sole mother of the hive. She is always\r\nguarded by a small retinue of attendants, who feed and care for her as\r\nshe wanders from cell to cell, depositing an egg in each with untiring\r\nzeal. The egg develops into a tiny grub-like worm, which is fed for\r\nseven days by young workers; then the cell is capped over by another\r\nset of workers, the grub being left undisturbed for eleven or twelve\r\ndays, by which time it has developed into a full-fledged bee, which\r\ngnaws its way out of the cell, and at once takes up the duties of life.\r\nFor six or seven days its time is devoted to feeding the newly-hatched\r\neggs, then, for about the same length of time, building combs and\r\ncleaning the hives, after which it is evidently considered strong\r\nenough to leave the hive and commence the arduous task of gathering\r\nhoney. The queen is exempt from all work.\r\n\r\nWithin a week or two after a virgin queen has taken her nuptial flight,\r\nthe hive should be opened and the frames removed, one by one, and\r\nexamined until the queen is found. She can be distinguished from the\r\nothers by the length of her body and the way the other bees cluster\r\naround her. Pick her up very gently by the back, being careful not to\r\nsqueeze her abdomen, and with a pair of sharp scissors clip both wings\r\non one side of her body. This insures a short flight at swarming-time.\r\nWhen she again issues from the hive, usually the excited condition of\r\nthe bees will indicate when this is going to take place, and as the\r\nqueen cannot fly with her cut wings, you will have little trouble, for\r\nshe will be found on the ground near the hive, with a group of bees\r\naround her, and the full swarm not far away. Approach very quietly, and\r\nplace a small wire trap over the queen. The traps are sold by all the\r\nbee-supply firms, and cost twenty-five cents. Place the trap in the\r\nopening of the hive you desire the swarm to occupy, cautiously approach\r\nthe full swarm, and with a soft broom sweep the bees into the hive if\r\nthe position they occupy makes it possible; if not, use a box or pan,\r\nand carry them to the hive and empty them in front. They will soon\r\ncommence to occupy the new home. The slide of the queen trap can be\r\nopened, and the bees inside will settle down to business.\r\n\r\nAfter the first swarm, early in the season, it is advisable to take\r\nevery possible means to prevent after-swarms. Want of room is the main\r\ncause for old bees leaving a hive, so a great deal may be accomplished\r\nby careful manipulation of the frames. The lower part of the hive is\r\ndevoted to brood-rearing; the other part is composed of the frames\r\nwhich hold the section-boxes. Section-boxes are the small square cases\r\nin which comb-honey is marketed.\r\n\r\nAmong the modern inventions in apiculture is the comb foundation, or\r\nstarter, as it is sometimes called. In the old days bees had to supply\r\nall the wax to build the combs. Now it is bought with the cells ready\r\nstarted, and the bees have only to draw them out and finish off the\r\nwork, which of course saves the little workers much time, and enables\r\nthem to store more honey. What is termed medium foundation is used in\r\nthe brood-frames, and thin or extra thin in the section-boxes. Bees\r\nwill sometimes ignore extra space when added above the frames where\r\nthey have been working, so it is advisable to raise the top super, and\r\ninsert another one below it. This supplying empty sections materially\r\nmitigates swarming, but does not always prevent it. It is the\r\nafter-swarms that it is so important to check, as they are of little\r\nuse, seldom being able to gather sufficient stores to keep them through\r\nthe winter. In September all hives should be examined, and if any have\r\nless than twenty-five pounds of honey, artificial feeding must be\r\nresorted to. Make a syrup of equal quantities of sugar and water; heat\r\nslowly, stirring all the time, being very careful not to let it scorch,\r\nfor burnt syrup means destruction to the bees. Allow it to cool, and\r\nthen fill what is known as a Miller feeder, which costs thirty-five\r\ncents, and fits into any of the movable-frame hives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CELLAR STORE ROOM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING FRUIT AND VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least one-half of the profit to be derived from living in the\r\ncountry materialises in winter when fruit and vegetables can be struck\r\nfrom the family living expenses, so the keeping and storing of the\r\ngarden and orchard products are of great importance to the housewife\r\nwho wants to make the home furnish current expenses. To keep well,\r\nthings must be gathered at the moment between full development and\r\ncomplete ripeness, for, if development is not complete, fruit and\r\nvegetables shrink and wither; if completely ripe, they decay rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe house cellar, attic, or a root-cellar or pit in the garden are all\r\navailable on a country place, and all suitable for different things.\r\nThe cellar is best for storing fruits and vegetables. Long ago we had\r\nracks made of two-by-two scantling--some six feet long, others three\r\nfeet, and both two feet wide--to put under barrels and boxes to lift\r\nthem from the ground and allow a free current of air to circulate\r\nunderneath them as a protection against damp and mildew. To economise\r\nspace, we had boxes, ten feet long and ten inches deep, fixed in tiers\r\nof three, with one foot of space between. The frames which supported\r\nthem were also made of two-by-two scantling, and reached from the\r\nrafters of the ceiling to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe keeping of early fruits, like currants, strawberries, and\r\nraspberries, depends principally upon the cook’s skill, for they have\r\nto be canned and made into preserves and jellies. Get into the habit\r\nof doing such work in small quantities--from a quart to six quarts, or\r\neven a pint, as the day’s gathering may provide. The habit of waiting\r\nfor the height of the season, when a big gathering is possible, is\r\nfrequently the cause of home-canned goods spoiling, because some of the\r\nfruit is almost sure to be overripe, and that means that fermentation\r\nor mould will set in, in a short time, and ruin the entire boiling.\r\n\r\nAfter wiping and labelling the jars, they must be kept in a cool, dark\r\nplace. We have a big cupboard at the back of the outside section of the\r\ncellar, where all such goods are kept. Begin with asparagus, which is\r\nbest packed into jars filled with salt and water, and cooked in a steam\r\nboiler for an hour and a half. Peas are shelled, and about two quarts\r\nof the hulls and a sprig of mint are boiled in four quarts of water for\r\nthirty minutes, then strained, the water brought to the boiling-point,\r\nsalted to taste, and the peas boiled slowly in it for thirty minutes.\r\nFill the jars to overflowing, and screw down the tops at once. Beans\r\nmust be strung and sliced and boiled in salted water, as for table,\r\nor packed in two-inch layers, with a sprinkling of salt between, in a\r\nstone crock. Put a plate or a stone on top of the beans to keep them\r\nunder the brine, and cover closely. When wanted for use, soak in fresh\r\ncold water overnight and cook in the usual way.\r\n\r\nGathering and packing is of the greatest importance in keeping fruit.\r\nThe most favourable time is when the fruit has attained its full growth\r\nand colour, which is several days before it is quite ripe. All fruit\r\nshould be handled with the greatest care; the slightest bruise or\r\nscratch starts a condition which will develop rot. A high extension\r\nladder, a high step-ladder, and an agile boy are the requisites for\r\npicking. When possible, choose a bright, cool day, have the boxes and\r\nbarrels ready, and press all help into service. Before allowing anyone\r\nto pick apples, teach him how. Take the apple lightly, turn it slowly,\r\nand press upward, so that the stem is severed from the branch, not from\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nWhoever does the climbing should discard shoes, for they are apt to\r\ninjure the bark of the tree, which always causes later troubles.\r\nA shallow bag, slung across the body sling-fashion, is the best\r\nreceptacle for the picker to use, because it leaves both hands free.\r\nThe work is greatly facilitated if two people can pick, two pack,\r\nand a fifth take the fruit from the pickers to the packers. Have two\r\nbag-slings for each person picking, so that the collector can take the\r\nfull one and hand up an empty one, which saves emptying the fruit into\r\na basket.\r\n\r\nThe packers and the barrels, or boxes, should stand side by side, with\r\na box of convenient height and size turned upside down to act as a\r\ntable on which to place the sling-bags when full. The best apples\r\nare packed in small boxes, with paper between the layers. The second\r\nquality are put into barrels. Put a layer of hay in the bottom of the\r\nbarrel, fill it with the fruit, and end with a layer of hay. The small\r\nones may be used for cider and for feeding stock.\r\n\r\nOnions are ready to harvest when the tops fall down and dry. Choose a\r\ndry day to dig them up. Leave the bulbs lying on the ground for several\r\ndays, then carry into a shed, where they can be spread out for two or\r\nthree days more, while the work of cutting off the roots and tops is\r\nbeing completed. We have a room over the woodshed which we use for\r\nonions, as they are apt to sprout in a cellar that is moist enough to\r\nkeep other root-crops in good condition. We had tiers of shelves, made\r\nof slats, put up all round the walls, on which the onions are spread\r\nout, and, as a precaution against frost, they are covered with bags or\r\ndry autumn leaves as severe weather approaches. Bore holes about nine\r\ninches apart in the sides of the barrels; fill with the onions, leaving\r\nthe head of the barrel off, and stand in any unused room.\r\n\r\nPotatoes should be dug as soon as the tops die down. Choose a dry,\r\nbright day and cart at once into a dark place to dry. Don’t leave them\r\nin the light on the field, but spread out for a few days, then pack\r\nthem in the cellar in barrels which have a few holes bored in them, or\r\nin bins which have a bottom made of slats.\r\n\r\nCarrots, turnips and beets should be packed in boxes or on tiers of box\r\nshelves. In either case, they should be well covered with sand or soil\r\nto prevent the roots shrivelling. Put a few boards in a sunny place,\r\nand stand the squash and pumpkins on them. They should stay there\r\nabout a week or ten days, and be covered at night with bags or an old\r\nblanket, after which put them in some dry, cool place.\r\n\r\nCauliflowers are pulled up with as much soil as may be attached to the\r\nroots, and hung head down from ceiling of the cellar; Brussels sprouts,\r\nthe same. Cabbage is pulled up in the same way and packed in rows of\r\ntwo or three abreast on the cellar floor. These are for use in very\r\nbad weather. The main quantity is stacked in a pit in the garden and\r\ncovered with earth, straw and brush.\r\n\r\nCelery is partly protected by being earthed up for bleaching, so it can\r\nbe left in the garden until the first of October, or even the fifteenth\r\nif mild, but it must be brought in before heavy frost. About nine\r\ninches of soil is spread on the floor all along one side of the cellar.\r\nThe celery is dug and brought in with what earth adheres to the roots,\r\nand then set in the soil just as if the plants were expected to grow,\r\nonly they are put very close together and about three abreast. When the\r\nrow is completed, boards are set upon end, the full length of the row,\r\nand another set of heads is packed in the same way, each additional row\r\nbeing divided by boards. This is done to prevent the celery heating,\r\nand rot setting in, as would be the case if the entire mass was\r\nallowed to touch. After the setting-up is all done, earth is scattered\r\nheavily between the heads.\r\n\r\nThere is usually a large quantity of green tomatoes still on the vines\r\nin the fall, and the full-sized ones can be packed in shallow boxes,\r\nwith paper between the layers, and kept in a cool, dark place. Later in\r\nthe season bring out a few at a time to ripen in the window of a warm\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nGrapes must be carefully cut, the bunches examined and any faulty\r\ngrapes removed with a pair of scissors. Put slats across a box about\r\ntwo inches from the top, tying the bunches of grapes to the slats\r\nand letting them hang down into the box, leaving a space between the\r\nbunches. Fill the box up with finely-cut tissue-paper and keep on the\r\nshelf in the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe cellar for storing fruit must be well ventilated and free from\r\ndamp, though a cement cellar is apt to be too dry, which causes the\r\nfruit to shrivel. In such a case, stand a tub or a couple of pails\r\nof water in the cellar, and do not fail to change it once or twice\r\na month. A dry cellar with an earthen floor is usually about right,\r\nthough, if rapid thaws occur during the early spring, such a floor is\r\nlikely to become very damp; as a remedy, put one or two wide, shallow\r\nboxes, filled with unslaked lime, into the cellar, which will absorb\r\nthe moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCING RHUBARB AND ASPARAGUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had little more than settled on the farm when I read an article in\r\nsome farm paper about forcing rhubarb in a dark cellar. There was a\r\nlot of rhubarb in the garden, and a lot of room in the cellar. Several\r\nroots were dug up and packed in one corner of the section we kept for\r\nvegetables, but as the article had not mentioned that any heat was\r\nnecessary, and that it was necessary to expel all light, the venture\r\nwas not a success, for there was a window in the wall near the chosen\r\ncorner, which allowed the light to shine right on the roots, and the\r\ntemperature was much too cold. There were dozens of spindly little\r\nstalks, with large green leaves at their ends, but nothing worthy the\r\nname of pie-plant.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the following winter I had secured technical knowledge\r\nand vicarious experience, to start on. The window was boarded up, and\r\ntwo lanterns were kept burning near the roots. We had rhubarb charlotte\r\nand rhubarb pies, and stewed rhubarb for breakfast, just as often as we\r\nliked, from December until March, and what is more to the purpose, we\r\nsold eighty-two dollars’ worth.\r\n\r\nAfter we built the mushroom-cellar, a section was partitioned off\r\nfor rhubarb and asparagus, and both became profitable adjuncts to our\r\nwinter income. One great advantage about both of these crops for home\r\nuse is that there is no necessity to use manure or any great amount of\r\nmoisture, and for that reason there is no objectionable odour to sift\r\nthrough into the living-rooms.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when large quantities are to be raised for market, it\r\nis better to have a special room for work, but even that does not\r\nnecessitate any serious outlay. A neighbour built a house twenty-eight\r\nfeet long on the dugout plan, on a side-hill at the back of his house;\r\njust boarded up the front and ends with rough slabs, which cost him two\r\ndollars and fifty cents. Three rolls of tar-paper, at one dollar and\r\nten cents each, were used to exclude light and draft. Stove-pipe cost\r\nanother two dollars. He had an old stove, but even if he had had to buy\r\none, it would only have meant another eight or ten dollars, and the\r\nfirst crop brought him in one hundred and thirty dollars.\r\n\r\nThere is often some old building around a farm which can be utilised\r\nfor this work, but if there is no hillside or building available, it\r\nis better to excavate to a depth of three feet, making the house about\r\nnine feet wide and as long as you like. This will allow a two-foot path\r\nthrough the middle, and a little more than three feet on each side,\r\nin which to store the roots. Side-walls need be only a foot above the\r\nground, but it is best to have a peaked roof, the centre of which is\r\nthree and a half feet above ground, so that there will be plenty of\r\nheadroom in the centre of the house.\r\n\r\nPlace a door at one end, with an extension shed and storm door beyond\r\nit, unless the house can be built adjoining some shed or outbuilding\r\ninto which the door may open. Cover the ends and roof with tar-paper,\r\nand bank the sides up with earth. Then in the centre of the house make\r\na pit, about two feet below the floor and large enough for a stove to\r\nstand in, and run the pipe from a double elbow to each end of the house.\r\n\r\nThe reason for making the pit for the stove to stand in is to get the\r\npipe as near the ground as possible. It is possible to do without the\r\nstove if the floor of the house is covered with manure and a goodly\r\nsupply is packed around the sides of the house, but as that would be\r\nmore expensive and much more laborious, I advise you to adopt the\r\nstove plan, especially as it involves none of the harrowing niceties\r\nusually attached to running hothouse heating apparatus, there being no\r\nwater-pipes to freeze or injury to crops if the fire happens to run\r\ndown or even go out altogether. My neighbour, who built the house on\r\nthe side hill, tells me that he had no coal-stove at first, and used\r\nthe kerosene cooking-stove from his summer kitchen.\r\n\r\nHaving decided where and what quantity is to be raised next winter,\r\nthe preliminary work must be begun at once. If you have a lot of old\r\nroots in the garden, dig up the greater number just as soon as it\r\nis possible to put a spade in the ground, and cut the roots into\r\ngood-sized chunks, being careful to leave from two to four eyes (embryo\r\nbuds, which are unmistakable) in each clump.\r\n\r\nIf you have a strip of ground on which corn or potatoes were grown last\r\nyear, scatter barn-yard manure over it. If it is heavy loam, plough\r\ndeeply, but if light sandy soil, the furrows need not be more than six\r\ninches deep, and in addition to the barn-yard fertiliser it will be\r\nwell to use a heavy dressing of wood ashes. We spread the barn-yard\r\nmanure about three inches deep all over the surface of the ground\r\nbefore ploughing, then broadcast ashes, harrowing up and down, leave\r\nfor about two weeks, and then harrow from side to side.\r\n\r\nWhen in good condition, the ground must be marked off into rows about\r\nfour feet apart. Run the plough twice in the same furrow, and the\r\ntrench will be deep enough to admit of a little more manure being\r\nscattered, then covered lightly with soil before the plants are put in.\r\nSet them three feet apart. Cultivate well through the summer to keep\r\nclean and promote growth.\r\n\r\nCut out any flower-stalks which may appear, for one flower-stalk takes\r\nmore strength from the root than twenty fruit-stalks, so they should\r\nnever be allowed to mature, even in the ordinary garden-beds.\r\n\r\nThe clumps left undisturbed for the summer supply should have a good\r\ndressing of manure worked into the ground around them now and again\r\nafter the gathering season is over, so that they will be in good\r\ncondition to go into the cellar in December.\r\n\r\nWhen old clumps have been divided and set out in April, they will be\r\nlarge and strong enough to use for forcing the following December,\r\nbut if young nursery plants have to be bought, it is better to defer\r\nforcing until the second winter.\r\n\r\nAbout November 15th we dig up the roots and leave them to be frozen;\r\nthen about December 1st, or even a little earlier if the nights have\r\nbeen frosty, one-half the roots are piled up in a shed, and the other\r\nhalf packed on the earth floor of the forcing-house. A little earth is\r\nscattered between them, and then they are sprinkled with water in which\r\nnitrate of soda has been dissolved, one ounce of the latter to one\r\ngallon of water.\r\n\r\nThe stove is started, a wash-boiler of water put on, and then the work\r\nsimply consists of shaking down the stove, putting on half a scuttle of\r\ncoal and filling up the boiler night and morning.\r\n\r\nIn from three to four weeks the first gathering is made. Stalks should\r\nbe from twelve to fourteen inches high, and four usually go to a bunch.\r\nThe roots will yield good crops for from three to four weeks, but\r\ngathering should cease when the crop shows any sign of declining.\r\n\r\nWhen you decide that the roots shall stop bearing, let the fire go\r\nout. Three or four days later the roots can be removed and piled in a\r\nshed, and those that have been held dormant brought in and spread on\r\nthe cellar floor. Proceed as with the first lot, and at the end of\r\nthe season simply let out the fire again and wait until the weather\r\nwill permit outside planting. Then divide the roots into two or three\r\npieces, according to size, and plant in rows as before. They will be\r\nready for forcing again the second winter, so that, once started, the\r\nsupply is always on the increase.\r\n\r\nAsparagus can also be forced in the same manner as rhubarb, the only\r\ndifference being that asparagus roots don’t divide well, so seed has\r\nto be sown each year to keep up a stock for forcing. Plants cannot be\r\nused until the third season, and they are not supposed to be worth\r\nreplanting for forcing.\r\n\r\nAsparagus can also be forced by placing hotbed frames and sashes over\r\nthe plants, and banking up all around the frames with stable manure,\r\nto generate heat. This method only slightly hastens the crop. There\r\nis nothing quite as satisfactory or profitable as the dark house\r\nor cellar, because growing roots from seed is comparatively little\r\ntrouble, and the supply once started, it is an easy matter to keep up a\r\nsuccession of three-year-old roots. Time can be saved the first year by\r\nbuying one- or two-year-old plants from a nursery, planting them in the\r\ngarden, and the following year use for forcing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nA country home large enough to maintain a cow should certainly keep a\r\npig, if things are to be run on a profitable basis, for the skim-milk,\r\nbuttermilk and waste vegetables cannot be satisfactorily disposed of,\r\nunless there is a pig to consume them. Build the sty first. Ours is\r\nbuilt on the English plan, a sleeping-compartment six feet square, five\r\nfeet high in front, three feet at back. Outer compartment of same size,\r\nwith walls three feet high, floor slanting slightly to the front. There\r\nis a trough in each corner of the open compartment. The floor of the\r\nsleeping-room is six inches higher than the outer compartment, and the\r\nwhole building, except the roof, is made of concrete, so can be easily\r\nand thoroughly cleansed.\r\n\r\nIf several sows are to be kept, each must have a sty, and there should\r\nbe one or two large ones for young stock. The piggery should be as far\r\nfrom the house and water-supply as possible.\r\n\r\nIf funds have to be very carefully dispensed, start with a pair of\r\nyoung ones, which usually can be bought in any farming district in\r\nthe spring for about six dollars a pair when six weeks old. They will\r\nneed a little extra care at first, a warm bed of common hay or dry\r\nleaves over straw. It is advisable to watch them at feeding-time to\r\nsee that they eat. The first week boil a quart of wheat-bran, pounded\r\noatmeal (hulled oats very coarsely ground), coarse corn-meal and white\r\nmiddlings, and twelve quarts of water for half an hour. Let stand until\r\ncold, then add skim-milk sufficient to make it like rather thick gruel.\r\nGive four quarts three times a day for two pigs. Gradually accustom\r\nthem to vegetables. Outside leaves of cabbage, lettuce and other\r\ngreens, potato-peelings and peapods can all be utilised. Boil until\r\ntender, mix a little bran or round oats with them, and feed once a day.\r\nAfter a week or ten days gradually reduce the gruel and substitute\r\nregular feed, bearing in mind always that frame must be built before\r\nfattening is attempted.\r\n\r\nIf there is plenty of cash in the exchequer, time can be saved by\r\npurchasing a mature sow due to farrow in April. When making your\r\nselection, choose a placid-looking animal with a reputation for being\r\na good mother. A vicious, bad-tempered pig is a menace on a home farm.\r\nMoreover, the vicious sow is generally a bad mother. Probably no animal\r\nis more easily affected by the treatment it receives when young than\r\na pig. Treated kindly, they become tractable, gentle creatures; if\r\nabused, surly and dangerous. For this reason it is perhaps better for\r\nthe amateur to commence with a pair of little ones, or one old sow.\r\nSuppose you have bought a sow after breeding; you may expect little\r\nones in sixteen weeks. Her litter may consist of any number from six\r\nto fourteen. Let her have plenty of exercise until a few days before\r\nshe is due, then restrict her range to her own sty.\r\n\r\nFor safety, it is well to make a fender-like frame that will stand\r\nabout six inches above the floor and the same from the side-walls. Then\r\nif Mrs. Mother is careless enough to roll over, any baby that happens\r\nto be in danger of being crushed can escape under the fender. We used\r\nsome old oak fence-rails, cutting them to fit snugly across from wall\r\nto wall, and bored large auger-holes seven inches from each end. Strong\r\nbolts and nuts were put through the corners, and blocks of wood six\r\ninches square are placed for it to rest on; being bolted together, they\r\nare easily taken apart and in and out of the pens, as they are not\r\nwanted after the little ones are a few days old.\r\n\r\nHave the sleeping-compartment thoroughly cleaned out and bedded with\r\nstraw and the fender put in place four or five days before the litter\r\nis expected, and don’t disturb it after that until they are four\r\nor five days old. Put a small quantity of clean straw in the outer\r\ncompartment during the last week. About a month before farrowing-time\r\nlet bran and ground oats predominate in the sow’s rations, and add\r\na little linseed-meal. She should be kept in full vigour, but not\r\nallowed to get fat, for which reason corn is best eliminated from her\r\nfood. After the litter has arrived give nothing heavier than a little\r\nbran-gruel for twenty-four hours. Feed lightly for two or three days,\r\nthen increase, giving her about all she wants; at the end of ten days\r\ncommence to add corn-meal in limited quantities and green food of some\r\nsort, unless the weather is such that the family can go out to pasture.\r\nThere should be a little opening in the outer compartment large enough\r\nfor the youngsters to creep through, and outside a fenced-in yard, in\r\nwhich there is no trough. When the babies are two weeks old give them\r\na little grain. They will soon learn to help themselves, and so reduce\r\nthe trouble at weaning-time. We take the mother away when they are\r\nsix or seven weeks old and let her run with the herd until again near\r\nfarrowing-time. If a boar is kept, he should have his own sty and a\r\nseparate yard. His food should be good, but not too fattening. The best\r\nage is between one and five years.\r\n\r\nTo keep pigs successfully on the home farm, you must disabuse your mind\r\nof the idea that they are naturally dirty creatures, for they really\r\nare not. Given clean quarters, a stream to bathe in, and wholesome\r\nfeed, they are as self-respecting as any animal on the farm. If there\r\nis no brook nor spring-place near the pasture, a large patch of sod\r\nshould be removed, and the hollow filled with water. After a few weeks\r\nlet it dry up, and make a new bath.\r\n\r\nSee that no horrible half-mouldy swill-barrels are kept around. Table\r\nscraps, excepting meat, vegetable peelings, small potatoes, apples,\r\nin fact all unmarketable vegetables, are boiled in the food-cooker\r\nwith about the same amount of salt that we should use in cooking for\r\nthe table. When everything is soft, bran, crushed oats, shorts or\r\nmiddlings are stirred in to make it into a thick porridge, the whole\r\nbeing closely covered and allowed to stand until cold. Sometimes\r\ncornstalks are chopped and boiled in the same way. When a feed-cooker\r\nis used, preparing the food is very little trouble, and most certainly\r\nit goes further than uncooked. Each animal has a pailful night and\r\nmorning. Skim-milk and buttermilk, when there is any to spare, and\r\na forkful of ensilage in the winter when there is no pasture. Water\r\nstands before them all the time in one of the cement troughs, into\r\nwhich twice a week a pailful of coal-ashes is put to aid digestion,\r\nand once a week an ounce of sulphur and charcoal is added to the feed.\r\nWhen pigs weigh about one hundred pounds, corn can commence to take the\r\nplace of their grain, for from then on fattening is the one end and\r\naim of management. The fleshy, small or medium pig, which weighs from\r\ntwo hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds brings a better price\r\nin the Eastern markets nowadays than the large greasy pig, so that\r\nreturns are realised more quickly, and it pays to force them with the\r\nbest of food. If by any chance a sow should farrow late in November,\r\nit is more profitable to market the little ones as sucking pigs than\r\nto try to keep them through the cold of January and February. Ham and\r\nbacon is necessarily a staple in country households, and a real luxury\r\nwhen home-cured. As soon as the meat is cool, it must be cured, for\r\nshould it become frozen, it is impossible to turn it into good ham and\r\nbacon. Sugar and Wiltshire are the two preferred methods. There is\r\na small hand-machine on the market, specially made for injecting the\r\nliquid for the Wiltshire method. The positive price I don’t know, but\r\nI believe it is about ten dollars. However, I have used a white metal\r\nsyringe, which holds thirty-six ounces and answered very well for the\r\nsmall quantity undertaken. The process given in an old English receipt\r\nis as follows: Add to five gallons of water, twelve pounds of salt,\r\none pound of saltpetre, one ounce of salt prunella, two pounds of\r\nbrown sugar. Bring slowly to the boiling point, let simmer for fifteen\r\nminutes, skim; when cool it is ready to use in the injecting machine or\r\nsyringe. Insert the syringe in the flesh, and inject the pickle. This\r\nis to be done every few inches over the entire surface of the meat, to\r\ninsure the full piece being permeated with the liquid. Lay the meat on\r\nthe slab, powder with saltpetre, lay the rind side downwards and cover\r\nthe cut side with a thick coating of salt. The work should be done on\r\na stone slab, or hardwood bench with raised edges. Let the meat remain\r\nfifteen days, and recover with fresh salt. After seven days more, wash\r\nthe meat with clean cloths, and hang up to dry for several days before\r\nsmoking. The dry sugar-cured method, is, I think, to be preferred in\r\nthis country, because it is more generally liked. Place the hams and\r\nsides on a slab, and proceed as follows: Mix five pounds of salt with\r\nthree pounds of brown sugar and two ounces of saltpetre. Thoroughly rub\r\nall parts of the meat, every third day for three weeks, after which,\r\nwash and wipe and dry for smoking. Of course, you know that nothing\r\nbut hard wood must be used for the fire. Green hickory is the best.\r\nSausages should be composed of one-third bread--stale bread grated.\r\nNever use new or moistened bread. Casings only cost five cents a pound,\r\nso it is better to buy them already prepared. A good mixture is five\r\nparts lean pork, one part fat, two parts veal or mutton. Pass through\r\nthe chopping machine, then to every eight pounds add one teaspoonful of\r\ndried and finely powdered sage, thyme, and marjoram, two teaspoonfuls\r\neach of mustard, pepper and salt. Add the bread-crumbs last, thoroughly\r\nmix, and fill the casings. Make short, fat links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARING FOR HOUSE PETS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all probability no creature on earth suffers so desperately from\r\nhuman ignorance as the house pet. People who keep horses, cattle or\r\neven poultry consider it necessary to know something about their wants\r\nand requirements, but the poor pet animal is the recipient of much\r\naffection and many cruelties, for it is cruel to ruin the health by\r\ninjudicious feeding, and vitality and happiness by want of exercise. A\r\nwholesome, happy dog or cat is the best playfellow children can have;\r\nan entertaining companion for any member of the human race, but an\r\nailing, unhealthy animal is a positive menace to the family.\r\n\r\nThe young dog just taken from its mother requires special care and\r\npatient training, or it will not develop into an intelligent companion.\r\nEven an older dog who comes from kennels of repute will require careful\r\nguiding. Of course, I refer to the general house-dog; hunting-dogs are\r\nusually broken to their special duties before being sold. But the house\r\nor pet dog must understand a multitude of things, all of which vary\r\naccording to the idiosyncrasies of the family who adopt it, so it has\r\nto readjust its habits to new owners and environment.\r\n\r\nHave a kennel ready before the dog arrives. A dry-goods case covered\r\nwith roofing-paper will do if it has two heavy pieces of scantling\r\nnailed across the bottom, to lift it three or four inches above the\r\nground, so that the air can circulate under it and prevent moisture\r\nfrom the ground making the floor damp. Place it in a sheltered\r\nposition, out of winter winds or the glare of a summer sun. A good\r\nstraw bed every week in cold weather and a good scrubbing in warm\r\nweather are sanitary precautions which should be observed. Have a\r\nstrong screw-eye at one side of the kennel and a chain with a swivel\r\nsnap at each end to prevent the chain getting twisted up to half its\r\nlength, and for convenience when handling a strange dog.\r\n\r\nIf the dog has been crated and expressed, remember that in all\r\nprobability the poor beast will be frightened, tired and cross. Talk to\r\nit for a while, and manage, if possible, to get a collar on and a chain\r\nattached before opening the crate. Then let Mr. Dog get out by himself,\r\nat his own time. Walk him about for some time and let him inspect the\r\npremises in the neighbourhood of the house. Naturally cleanly dogs\r\nwill need the exercise, so don’t curtail it. If there are any signs of\r\nconstipation, a dish of sour milk will usually correct the trouble. If,\r\nhowever, the journey has the reverse effect, which is very likely to be\r\nthe case in summer, scald milk, pour over some stale bread which has\r\nbeen toasted and feed when quite cool.\r\n\r\nWhen the dog has finished his inspection of the premises, fasten him to\r\nthe kennel and be sure to provide a solid, heavy water-pan that cannot\r\neasily be knocked over. Leave him to become accustomed to his new home\r\nand to sleep off the nervous strain of the journey. Should he whine or\r\nbark, don’t go near him. He is too excited and upset to be disciplined,\r\nand sympathy and petting at this point would mean a prolonged fight\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nFeed him yourself and take him for a run on chain in the evening, early\r\nin the morning and at noon. Decide which will be the most convenient\r\nhours and try not to change them. Two or three days are usually\r\nsufficient to make the average dog accept a new master and claim the\r\nkennel as his castle, so after that time he can be allowed freedom.\r\n\r\nIf the dog is young and is to sleep out of doors, he should be chained\r\nat night, otherwise he will be apt to form the habit of wandering off\r\nin the early morning hours or moonlight nights, but no dog, young or\r\nold, should be kept perpetually chained. Young dogs, especially of the\r\nterrier class, are benefited by being chained in a cool, shady spot\r\nduring the middle of the day, as they are apt to rush about and be\r\novercome by the heat, which often causes fits and terrifies the family\r\ninto believing that it is a case of hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nIf the new dog is under nine months of age, feed him three times a\r\nday. Bread and milk, oatmeal, hominy, or any such food which has been\r\nwell boiled, allowed to cool and covered with milk, makes a suitable\r\nbreakfast. Lunch may be half a puppy-cake or a slice of brown bread.\r\nThe main meal should consist of boiled meat, onions and rice, mixed\r\nwith some cooked green vegetable.\r\n\r\nAfter the ninth month two meals a day are sufficient. Be as careful\r\nnot to overfeed as not to underfeed. A dog should be ready for each\r\nmeal, but never ravenously hungry. Don’t give milk which has not been\r\nscalded or potatoes in any form, if you wish to keep the puppy free\r\nfrom worms. Sour milk once or twice a week is beneficial, but must not\r\nbe given oftener. Twice a week a bone with some meat on it is needed.\r\nSome people think that raw meat is bad for dogs, but a limited quantity\r\nof fresh lean meat is really necessary for growing dogs, and being on\r\nthe bone necessitates a lot of gnawing, which is good for the teeth and\r\nencourages the flow of saliva which aids digestion.\r\n\r\nIf you should have a mother-dog with puppies, give her a large sleeping\r\nplace; dry and comfortably warm in winter, dry and cool in summer.\r\nPuppies should be taught to drink as soon as possible after they are\r\nsix weeks old. Condensed milk saves the trouble of scalding cow’s milk.\r\nWhichever is used should be given warm; never hot or cold. The puppies\r\nwill learn to eat more quickly if the mother is taken away for about an\r\nhour before offering food. Gradually increase the length of her absence\r\nuntil she spends only the nights with her babies, and weaning will be\r\naccomplished without any trouble.\r\n\r\nTo prevent worms, the one great trouble which attacks all dogs, give\r\nthe mother a dose of worm medicine three or four weeks before the\r\nbabies are expected, and give the babies very small doses when they are\r\nthree weeks old, six weeks old and nine weeks old. After that time I\r\ndepend on sour milk, and an occasional dose of castor-oil.\r\n\r\nHouse-breaking should be attended to as soon as the puppies commence\r\nto run about. Never leave a puppy alone in a room, for one mistake\r\nprompts others. Be watchful, and the moment a puppy begins to fidget or\r\nto run about, put it outside or in a box containing sawdust. Patience\r\nand perseverance are necessary at first, but in two or three weeks the\r\nlesson will be perfectly learned, especially if the hours of taking the\r\ndogs out are strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\nOld dogs, whose education in this respect has been neglected, can be\r\ntaught tidy habits if fed at regular hours, the last meal not later\r\nthan three o’clock in the afternoon, the evening exercise being\r\npostponed till about eight, after which they should be fastened to the\r\nbox or basket which acts as their bed by a chain not more than two feet\r\nlong. Release early in the morning and take out at once. They will soon\r\nunderstand the discipline of enforced hours, for the close proximity of\r\ntheir bed calls natural instinct to their assistance. The habit once\r\nformed, it will prevail when allowed to sleep in any part of the house.\r\n\r\nBathing dogs of any kind or size I don’t believe in very much, for\r\nit robs the skin of the natural oil which is required to feed the\r\nhair and keep it in condition. Brushing, however, is quite necessary,\r\nespecially in the summer, when fleas may be about, and it is well to\r\nbegin early in the season to rub some good insect-powder into the hair,\r\nthen after about half an hour brush it out thoroughly.\r\n\r\nDelicate small dogs with long hair can have a mixture of cocoanut and\r\nsweet almond-oil rubbed into the hair once a week and brushed out again.\r\n\r\nIf any accident makes washing unavoidable, stand the dog in a small\r\ntub half filled with warm water, rub white soap on a flesh-brush, and\r\nbrush from the center of the back with straight strokes to the end of\r\nthe hair on each side. Take the front paws in your left hand, letting\r\nthe dog stand on his hind legs, and brush from the neck down to clean\r\nthe under part of the body. The head should come last. Wash the ears\r\nfirst, being careful not to let water run into them. Hold the nose up\r\nand wash the top of the head and sides of the face, so that the water\r\nruns backward and not into the eyes. Last of all wash the muzzle, being\r\nvery careful about soap. Rinse in two clear waters, then wrap the body\r\nin a warm towel while you wipe the face and the inside of the ears.\r\n\r\nWhen about half dry let him down for a shake, but be careful he does\r\nnot escape under a piece of furniture and roll, as he will probably try\r\nto do. Brush until quite dry, rubbing a little oil onto the bristles,\r\nat the end of the dressing.\r\n\r\nTreat your dog at all ages with kindly consideration. Be patiently and\r\nconsiderately firm, remembering that you must rule through affection\r\nand respect. Don’t hector or worry all the time. Be your dog’s\r\nplayfellow as well as master, and he will soon become an intelligent\r\nand faithful protector.\r\n\r\nCats can be kept in a city home with less trouble than dogs, because\r\nthey haven’t got to be taken out to exercise, a duty which can’t be\r\nshirked with Mr. Dog. Cats are needed in suburban or country houses\r\nat least as much as dogs. The master of the house can usually guard\r\nagainst the rarely met burglar, but no human vigilance is adroit enough\r\nto fight four-legged pantry thieves, and a farm must have a good-sized\r\ntribe of felines to prevent loss in the barn, poultry house and\r\ncorn-crib.\r\n\r\nWell-bred cats are just as good hunters as common ones, so it is wise\r\nfor the self-supporting home to keep aristocratic cats for the house,\r\nas there is no occasion to do violence to your feelings when kittens\r\narrive, because they can always be sold at fairly good prices.\r\n\r\nIn the outbuilding we keep Maltese and very large blacks. We have\r\nso many requests for the Maltese and blacks that even the plebeian\r\nmothers are allowed to keep one or two kits of every litter, for\r\nhaving children to provide for is a great spur to Mrs. Cat’s hunting\r\nproclivities.\r\n\r\nConsidering the service cats perform for humanity by keeping in check\r\nthe numerous varieties of rodents which abound in cities no less than\r\nin country places, they should be the most highly prized and cared-for\r\nsmall animals we have instead of the most abused.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a prevailing but erroneous idea that cats are neither\r\naffectionate nor companionable. Treat a cat as you would an intelligent\r\ndog and she will compare so favorably that Mr. Dog will have to be\r\nextremely gifted to retain his superiority.\r\n\r\nThe outside cats should have plenty of fresh milk night and morning\r\nwhen the cows are milked, not only as food, but to counteract the\r\ninjurious effect of the number of mice they eat. New milk is rich in\r\ncream fats, and acts as an antidote to the poison contained in the gall\r\nof the mice. Twice a week we give them a feed of raw meat, on the bone\r\nif we can get enough bones, for even the rat-catchers must be well fed,\r\nor they lack the vitality to hunt.\r\n\r\nHaving plenty of exercise, and being able to find grass and herbs for\r\nthemselves, barn-cats are usually normal, healthy creatures, and need\r\nlittle dieting or doctoring from their owners, but they should always\r\nhave a good, warm place to sleep in.\r\n\r\nThe city house-cat leads such a semi-artificial life that she needs\r\nmore care. Milk which has stood several hours and been skimmed is not\r\nan especially good food. It should be scalded and allowed to cool\r\nbefore it is given to kittens.\r\n\r\nPeople rarely think to provide water for cats, yet they really prefer\r\nit to milk, and drink a surprising quantity when a dish of it is kept\r\nin one regular place. Potatoes should be as rigidly tabooed in the\r\nkittens’ diet as in the puppies’. Accustom a cat to eat cereal or bread\r\nand milk in the morning.\r\n\r\nOur house-cats always have a little strip of fat bacon when it has been\r\ncut for breakfast, and I am sure that the fat and salt are useful worm\r\npreventives. At noon they have liver or beef which has been stewed with\r\nonions and any green vegetable which we may have; for supper a saucer\r\nof milk.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to teach a kitten to be cleanly if you exercise\r\nvigilance at first and provide a shallow box or pan half filled with\r\nashes or sawdust. One thing which must be understood by the city\r\nhousekeeper whose pet has to depend entirely upon the box is that it\r\nmust be emptied regularly, at least once a day, and, if necessary,\r\ntwice. Neglect it and the animal’s instinct of cleanliness is offended,\r\nand it will select some place for itself, thereby falling into untidy\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING CANARIES FOR MARKET\r\n\r\n\r\nCanaries are dear, fascinating little creatures to keep, and no special\r\nconditions for raising which cannot be successfully accomplished in a\r\nlimited space. The most fastidious woman cannot object to caring for a\r\nfew families. One male and two females will start a profitable flock.\r\nThe male bird should be selected for his voice, regardless of his color\r\nor shape. The two other birds, on the contrary, should be selected\r\nfor those very qualifications. The male should be darker and deeper\r\nin colour than the female. In fact, male birds, with green on their\r\nwings and heads, mated with pale females, produce the best-coloured\r\nyoung ones. Never allow two top-knot birds to pair, for, oddly enough,\r\nthe progeny will usually have bald or deformed heads. A breeding cage\r\nwith separate compartments costs at least $4, but a very good one can\r\nbe made at home out of empty dry goods or grocery boxes. Of course,\r\nit must be a well-made, smooth one, otherwise it might hurt the\r\nbirds. Painting is not advisable, but it is well to rub off any rough\r\nsurfaces with coarse sandpaper. Remove the lid and one side of the\r\nbox. Leave the bottom, one side and ends intact. Turn the box so that\r\nthe remaining side becomes the bottom of the cage. Next get a piece\r\nof sheet zinc, nick the corners, and turn them up all around, to form\r\na tray an inch deep. This is to fit inside the cage. Square-meshed,\r\ngalvanised cloth is the best for the front and top. Fasten it to the\r\nback, ends and front with matting tacks, leaving a space at the bottom\r\nin front for the tray to slip in under. Put a partition through the\r\nmiddle of the cage, with a small door in it. A door is also necessary\r\nin each compartment. The ordinary seed and water dishes can’t be\r\nimproved on by home contrivances, so add them to the purchased list.\r\n\r\nTwo half cocoanut shells, or small boxes, must be hung up on the end or\r\nback of each compartment as foundations for the nest. Cover the bottom\r\nof the tray with a thick layer of bird-gravel, and hang up materials\r\nfor nest-building in each compartment. Dried moss, bits of raw cotton,\r\nor short fine hay, are all suitable. The material for a cage three feet\r\nlong, eighteen inches high and deep, will only cost a dollar, so the\r\nhomemade cage, in addition to being an economy, has the advantage of\r\nsize, which means a great deal in a breeding cage, as it allows the\r\nbirds so much more exercise.\r\n\r\nPut a female in each compartment, so that they may become accustomed to\r\neach other. In about a week, the door in the partition can be opened,\r\nand both birds allowed the freedom of both compartments. During this\r\ntime, the male bird must be kept in his own cage, and in another room.\r\nDuring these preliminary stages, which should run from three to four\r\nweeks, the three birds must have, in addition to their regular food, a\r\nsmall dish of mash every morning, made of hard-boiled egg chopped very\r\nfine, stale bread-crumbs, and hulled oats ground (not oatmeal or rolled\r\noats), equal parts of each, just moistened with scalded milk, and, of\r\ncourse, allowed to cool before being fed to the birds.\r\n\r\nAfter the two females are on friendly terms, bring the male bird’s\r\ncage into the room, and hang it before the breeding-cage, and out of\r\nsight, if possible. Curiosity will be aroused, and the birds will\r\nspend most of their time talking to each other, and endeavouring to\r\nsee each other. A week later, close the door in the partition, leaving\r\na female in each compartment. Put the two cages on a level; two or\r\nthree days later, open the door of one compartment, and the door of the\r\nmale bird’s cage, placing them close together. He will soon commence\r\ngoing in and out of the breeding-cage, and in a day or so his cage\r\nmay be removed. After the hen-bird commences to sit, open the door in\r\nthe partition, and let the male into the second compartment. When the\r\nsecond hen commences to sit, the door in the compartment can be left\r\npermanently open, as there is little fear of the birds’ fighting, and\r\nthe male will divide his attention between the two families, helping to\r\nfeed and care for the nestlings.\r\n\r\nSpecial care is necessary during the incubating period, for the eggs\r\nof these little songsters are exceedingly fragile, and a loud noise\r\nto which they are unaccustomed, even the slamming of a door, will\r\nsometimes addle them. Too bright a light is also annoying, so a piece\r\nof green baize pinned around the corner of the cage will give a sense\r\nof seclusion which will keep the bird tranquil and happy. Allow nothing\r\nto worry or trouble them while sitting.\r\n\r\nFourteen days after the first egg is laid, the young appear. The tiny\r\ncreatures are a great disappointment to those who see them for the\r\nfirst time. Chicks and ducklings are lovely from the time they first\r\nemerge from the shell; but a young canary is featherless, blind, and\r\nhas the longest neck imaginable. In a short time, however, it becomes\r\na golden ball of down, and its early unattractiveness is forgotten in\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nContinue the mash food, but after the little ones are hatched, feed\r\nnight and morning. Add rape seed which has been boiled a few minutes,\r\nand then rinsed through cold water. The nestlings’ eyes open about the\r\nsixth day. After the thirteenth day they will begin feeding themselves\r\nin the most independent manner. When the brood is a month old, remove\r\nthem to another cage. They will then begin to lose their first crop of\r\nfeathers, and must be carefully protected from draughts, lest they take\r\ncold. At the end of this first moulting period, you can tell how the\r\nyoung will develop, both for shape and song.\r\n\r\nThe mother bird will usually begin to build a second nest when the\r\nbabies in the first are about fourteen days old, sometimes keeping up\r\nthis double family from February till June; so that with good birds\r\nyou can count on having eight broods from the two females, with an\r\naverage of sixteen male birds. If the trainer--that is to say, the\r\nbird who teaches the young ones to sing--is a good songster, the males\r\nshould bring two dollars apiece when sixteen weeks old.\r\n\r\nThe young females can, with a little patience, be trained and taught\r\ntricks, which will make them worth as much or more than their brothers,\r\nwho have only voice to recommend them; but if the female’s education is\r\nignored, they are not worth more than fifty cents apiece, unless kept\r\nto breeding age. Cages must be kept scrupulously clean, with plenty of\r\nsand on the floor. Accustom the birds to having a bath dish put in for\r\na time every morning. Should the feet look soiled, or the nails be too\r\nlong, take the bird firmly, but gently, in your hand, and hold the feet\r\nin warm soap and water, to remove all dirt and soften the nails, the\r\nextreme points of which can be cut with a pair of sharp, fine scissors.\r\nTake care not to go above or too near the end--the end of the nerve\r\nthat can be seen running through the upper part of the nail; for if you\r\ndo, it will be painful to the bird, as cutting into the quick of your\r\nfinger-nail would be. If you are a real bird-lover, and have time and\r\npatience, you can accustom a flock to your presence until they will let\r\nyou go among them in a flying-room and handle them at your pleasure;\r\nfor they are naturally most affectionate, gentle little creatures, as\r\nfull of playfulness as a kitten. A solitary songster will feel neglect\r\nand loneliness to a pitiable degree, but will respond to petting as\r\nreadily as a child. A canary from the general stock of a bird-store is\r\ntimid and reserved at first, but will soon establish friendly relations\r\nbetween himself and his owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSINESS SIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the home profitable, there must be some system of bookkeeping\r\ninstituted, no matter how simple, also there must be some ingenuity\r\nexercised about marketing. Take advantage of the long evenings to\r\nstart books and lay plans for the disposal of surplus products to the\r\nbest advantage. Unless you know what each animal costs to keep, and\r\nwhat returns you are receiving from it, you can’t be sure what your\r\nprofits really are. I know how most amateurs hate to be bound down to\r\nthe actualities of a balance-sheet with its cold facts on what it costs\r\nto produce this, that or the other thing. But experience has taught me\r\nthat it is the crucial point and must be ascertained. Your accounts\r\nneed not be elaborate but they must be clear and accurate. Establish\r\nsome simple system of bookkeeping and after you have once overcome\r\nprejudice and made the plunge, it is really gratifying to know, for a\r\npositive fact whether things are really paying or not.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward general order is keeping records of individual\r\nanimals or flocks, as the case may be, and also of the farm and garden\r\ncrops. Bestow a name or number upon each animal, and if you are going\r\nin for husbandry in an extensive way, have a book for each variety. If\r\nonly two or three animals are to be kept, a general stock-book will do.\r\nEach field and meadow should be named or numbered, and a book devoted\r\nto work done on each.\r\n\r\nPoultry also needs a special book; so do expenses.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to head a page in the cattle register with the animal’s name\r\nor number; date of birth or purchase, with price; followed by when\r\nbred, to whom, when due, actual date of event, sex of offspring and\r\nname or number bestowed upon it. On the opposite page, if the animal is\r\na cow, the amount of milk she gives, a week after calving, and at one\r\nmeasuring every month until we cease milking her. Milk is tested for\r\nbutter-fats once in every three months and the result recorded.\r\n\r\nThe record of pigs and sheep is not so elaborate, because, of course,\r\nthere is only breeding and arrival of offspring to be noted. For\r\npoultry, the number of pens heads the page, followed by the number of\r\nbirds it contains, and the individual numbers, and on the opposite page\r\nthe number of eggs gathered each week.\r\n\r\nThe feed-book contains the amount of grain, etc., used for each variety\r\nof stock.\r\n\r\nThe farm-book is kept in a like manner, the field number heading the\r\npage; then, when ploughed; how and to what extent fertilised; with what\r\nvariety of seeds sown; number of times cultivated, when harvested and\r\nthe amount of the crop.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite page, in pencil, are suggestions for catch crops and\r\nrotation for main planting for a period of five years. Small note-pads\r\nwith pencils attached are fastened up in every stall or pen of each\r\noutbuilding, and events are jotted down as they occur, so that there\r\nis no chance of forgetting or getting things mixed. Every Saturday the\r\nsheets are torn from the pads and brought to the house, for the items\r\nto be transferred to the different books. It does not take half an hour\r\neach week to do the clerical work, and it saves innumerable mistakes\r\nand accidents, besides furnishing proof of the relative value of each\r\nanimal and piece of land.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the expense book all money spent is entered; on the\r\nother, all moneys received. A balance is struck every month and\r\ntransferred to a general ledger, which, in turn, is balanced once a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that must be understood is that all profits must not be\r\nconsidered as a bonus to be used for personal pleasure. Some part of\r\nall moneys received should be set aside as working capital, otherwise\r\nimprovement and extension are simply impossible.\r\n\r\nMarketing home products advantageously is of paramount importance, and\r\nseems to be the point on which many beginners fail. Commission men\r\nand wholesale markets should not be resorted to, because home-grown\r\nproducts of all descriptions excel in quality and not in quantity;\r\ntherefore, appeal to high-class private custom, who desire the very\r\nbest, regardless of price.\r\n\r\nI have never sold through any of the ordinary market channels, yet\r\nhave always had more orders than I could fill and received a little\r\nmore than the ordinary prices. Naturally the location of the home and\r\nthe quality of the wares must influence the returns to some extent,\r\nbut not half so much as the method of packing and shipping. Nicety in\r\nthese respects captures the favor of customers and they take pride in\r\nexhibiting things to their friends--which is the very best sort of\r\nadvertising a home business can have.\r\n\r\nWhen I had reached the point where I knew that I could depend on a\r\ncertain number of eggs regularly, I wrote to a doctor friend in the\r\ncity and told him that I could promise to deliver six dozen strictly\r\nfresh-laid eggs twice a week for the whole year, at a uniform price\r\nof forty-five cents a dozen; customers to pay the express charges,\r\nwhich would be twenty-five cents on each six dozen. (Express companies\r\nreturn empty packages free of charge.) Within a month he had found four\r\ncustomers for me, who would take two dozen a week each, the box to be\r\ndelivered at his house, where the other three customers were to call\r\nevery Saturday and Wednesday.\r\n\r\nAll poultry-supply houses have wooden boxes for sale with divided\r\ntrays, made to hold three, six or twelve dozen eggs, for about two\r\ndollars apiece. Before the year was out each of the three other\r\ncustomers had interested one or two friends, with the result that three\r\nsix-dozen boxes were shipped three times a week, and the following\r\nwinter I had orders from the same people for butter and table poultry.\r\n\r\nIn this way my market grew, as did my stock, and I never had any\r\nsurplus to worry about. Of course, I realise that there was an element\r\nof good luck in having a doctor for a friend, but when there is no good\r\nSamaritan to start a clientele for you, energy will surely accomplish\r\nit; for every housekeeper longs to get good, fresh-delivered table\r\ndelicacies which have not passed through a dozen hands.\r\n\r\nI know one woman who got her first customer by writing personal notes\r\nto women of social prominence in a near-by town, whose addresses she\r\ngot from a directory. From twenty letters she received two replies, but\r\nthey both became regular customers, and recommended friends.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of personal effort took the form of calls upon doctors\r\nand clergymen. Still another woman interested the fashionable milliner\r\nof her town to canvass orders among her customers, and paid for the\r\nfavour with eggs and butter.\r\n\r\nA more impersonal way of gaining customers would be to arrange with one\r\nor two well-located drug or stationery stores for the display of large\r\ncards bearing notices of the things for sale and your address; but,\r\nof course, there are dozens of ways to find customers. Advertising in\r\nnewspapers will do as a last resource, but strictly personal methods\r\nare the best.\r\n\r\nNow about packing. Eggs should never be more than two days old and\r\nmust be sorted into lots of uniform color and size. If the eggs should\r\nbecome soiled in muddy weather, wipe them with a damp cloth as soon as\r\ngathered, so that the shell does not become permanently stained.\r\n\r\nFor private customers, table birds should be especially fattened and\r\ndry picked, which means that the feathers are removed as soon as the\r\nbird has been killed, without its being dipped into scalding water. As\r\nthe scalding spoils the flavour, birds so dressed are only accepted by\r\nthird-class market.\r\n\r\nAfter the feathers and pin-feathers have all been removed, the bird\r\nshould be drawn, washed in cold water, wiped quite dry, a piece of\r\ncharcoal or peeled onion put inside the body and then trussed, for they\r\nlook so much more attractive than when shipped in a sprawling condition.\r\n\r\nDrawing and dressing for market is not the custom for general marketing\r\nin this country, but it is universal in Europe, and private customers\r\nalways appreciate the improvement such rigid cleanliness necessarily\r\nmakes in flavour. Wrap each bird in a square of new cheese-cloth. Place\r\na few sprigs of parsley, thyme and summer savoury at one side, for the\r\nconvenience of the cook; then put on an outer wrapping of white paper\r\nand tie with clean, fresh string. Things going from a home should look\r\ndainty.\r\n\r\nDon’t try sending butter by express unless you have orders enough to\r\nmake it worth while to buy one of the refrigerator hampers which are\r\nnow used for automobiles. A hamper which costs about four dollars will\r\nhold five or six pounds of butter, so it is not a very great outlay\r\nwhen you can get forty-five cents a pound for your butter. In making\r\nup hampers of fruit and vegetables, use small grape-baskets to divide\r\nthe different varieties. Line them with green leaves. Pack everything\r\nwith dainty care and reject everything which is not in perfect\r\ncondition. Don’t let anything interfere with the arranged schedule for\r\nshipping. Gain a reputation for uniform excellence and punctuality, and\r\nsuccess is sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors corrected silently.\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Making Home Profitable, by Kate V.
