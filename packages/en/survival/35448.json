The desire to obtain as large a representation\r\nof stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as\r\nwidely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the\r\nvarious classes of stock to hold open their books, and the delays\r\nincident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a\r\nlong correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from\r\nfurnishing the copy to the Publication Committee in season to have the\r\nwork finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records\r\nperfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed\r\nthis has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here\r\nrecorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.\r\n\r\n                              H. A.

It must be\r\nadmitted that the Short Horns present themselves to notice under\r\ncircumstances of peculiar interest; possessing in themselves a\r\ncombination of desirable qualities, and rendered attractive to the eye\r\nby their splendid frames, and beautiful varied colors, it is not\r\nsurprising they have become objects of public interest. Great temptation\r\nis laid before a class of men to manufacture _pure bloods_ to suit their\r\npurposes, being able to afford them at a much less price than a genuine\r\narticle. Great facilities are within the reach of all at the present\r\nday, who desire to become acquainted with their history and their great\r\nperformance at the shambles, and for the dairy, and general usefulness\r\nas farm stock.\r\n\r\nThe beef producers, and beef dealers uniformly acknowledge their great\r\nsuperiority over common stock. In the month of November, 1817, the\r\nimproved Durham Short Horn Bull, Young Denton, (963) then sixteen months\r\nold, arrived in Boston, sent out from England by Samuel Williams, of\r\nLondon, a present to his brother Stephen Williams, of Northboro',\r\nWorcester Co., Mass.; he remained there until 1827 or 1828, when he was\r\ntaken to the State of Maine, where he died, April 16, 1830. His Sire was\r\nDenton, (198); his G. Sire Comet, (155); was sold for 1000 guineas in\r\n1810. In 1822, Mr. Williams received the Short Horn Cow, Arabella, from\r\nthe same source; her Sire was North Star, (460); Dam, Aurora by Comet,\r\n(155). Both of these animals were bred by that eminent breeder, John\r\nWetherel, who was one of the four spirited purchasers of Comet (155) in\r\n1810, at the price before mentioned. It has been claimed by those who\r\nhave gone before us, that Young Denton (963) was the first improved\r\nDurham Short Horn Bull, imported into the United States. From these two\r\nimported animals sprang a very numerous progeny, and their descendants\r\nare scattered through all of the Northern States. In 1823 the Bull\r\nAdmiral, (1608) and Cow Arabella, were sent out from the same herd as a\r\npresent from Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, to the Massachusetts Agricultural\r\nSociety, who placed them under the charge of E. Hersey Derby, Esq., of\r\nSalem, Mass., who bred from them successfully a few years, when the\r\nstock on hand was sold and removed to Hartford Co., Conn. Many animals\r\nof the present day, trace back to this importation. About the same\r\nperiod, Israel Monson, Esq., of Boston, a large landholder, brought out\r\nthe Cow, Tube Rose, also from the herd of Mr. Wetherel. She produced but\r\none Heifer in this country, (Rose by Young Denton), which, with her\r\nMother and Daughter, (Nellie by Admiral, (1608)) died about the year\r\n1830.\r\n\r\nIn 1823. Mr. John S. Skinner, then editor of the American Farmer,\r\nBaltimore, imported two Heifers, Conquest and Pansey, and a Bull,\r\nWashington, (1566) for Gen. Stephen Van Renselaer, of Albany, N. Y., all\r\nfrom the herd of Mr. Champion, Blythe, England. Many of their\r\ndescendants are recorded in this book, and are scattered through all the\r\nNorthern States. All of the above mentioned animals possessed a very\r\nhigh order of excellence for milking capacity, both quality and\r\nquantity, and their descendants maintain that character in a very high\r\ndegree at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, Mr. Benjamin Rodman, of New Bedford, Mass., imported three\r\nHeifers, Adaliza, Dulcibella, and Galatea, and a Bull, Devonshire,\r\n(966) bred by Mr. Whitaker, of Burley, Yorkshire,--these were selected\r\nby Mr. Francis Rotch, then in England. One of them, Dulcibella was in\r\ncalf when purchased, and produced Dew Drop, by Charles, (878) from which\r\nhas sprung a numerous family of Cows, celebrated for their superior\r\ndairy qualities.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Mr. Enoch Silsby, of Boston, Mass., sent to England and brought\r\nout the Cow, Boston, by Sir Charles, (1440) and Bull, Boston, (1735)\r\nboth bred by Mr. Curry, of Brandon. These animals left a numerous\r\nprogeny, justly celebrated for strong constitutions as well as rich\r\nhandling and dairy qualities; many of their descendants are also\r\nrecorded in this book.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed the instances of Short Horn excellence herein cited\r\nare superior to many others; they are those that have been noted and the\r\nfacts made public.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beef Qualities._\r\n\r\nIn 1843 a thorough bred Heifer, Regina, three years and a half old,\r\nhaving nursed her calf through the summer, was in thin flesh in the\r\nfall. Her bag having been deformed by accident, and she not being in\r\ncalf, was put into a distillery stall in November, fed on slops and\r\nstraw, and slaughtered in April following, and her dressed weight, beef,\r\nhide and tallow, 1005 pounds; beef of the finest quality.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Lucy, a thorough bred Heifer, was turned to pasture with\r\nreference to making beef of her, she having proved barren, being then\r\nnearly four years old. She was put into the stable in November, fed on\r\ngood hay and a very small quantity of meal, it being the design to feed\r\nher a long time. On the fourth day of January following she was sold to\r\na butcher for ten dollars per cwt., estimated at 1,000 pounds. She was\r\nslaughtered at Hartford, Conn., being four years and five months old,\r\nhaving eaten less than _two bushels_ of meal in her life. Her beef was\r\nsold, all the prime pieces at twenty-five cents per pound; was a very\r\nbeautiful animal, with handling properties of the very highest order of\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1862, Pocahontas, a thorough bred Heifer, was\r\nsold and slaughtered, then five years and one month old. Her dressed\r\nweight was as follows: hide, ninety pounds; tallow, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven pounds; quarters, eleven hundred and eighteen pounds; total\r\ndressed weight, thirteen hundred and thirty-five pounds; was sold for\r\neight cents per pound, making $106.80. Her feed, other than hay and\r\ngrass, being twenty and one-half bushels of meal in all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dairy Qualities._\r\n\r\nLucilla, a thorough bred Heifer, at four years old, gave in June\r\nfifty-five pounds of milk on an average for one month; her greatest\r\nyield in one day was fifty-nine pounds and eight ounces, and during this\r\nmonth yielded fourteen pounds and eight ounces of butter in one week;\r\nher feed, grass, with three quarts of meal daily. At five years old the\r\nfirst week in June, her milk yielded fifteen pounds three ounces of\r\nbutter, on grass only.\r\n\r\nDorothy, a thorough bred Cow, gave thirty-nine pounds eight ounces of\r\nmilk per day, three months after calving, on grass only; and in seven\r\ndays made fifteen pounds one ounce of butter, in October.\r\n\r\nNymph 5th, in the month of June, 1860, gave twenty-four quarts of milk\r\ndaily for two weeks in succession, and made butter at the rate of two\r\npounds four ounces per day, or fifteen pounds three ounces per week, on\r\ngrass only.\r\n\r\nRose 2d, a thorough bred Cow, produced seventeen pounds four ounces of\r\nbutter from one week's milk in June, on grass only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Longevity._\r\n\r\nPrincess, a thorough bred Cow, bred regularly up to eighteen years old;\r\nwas then dried off and turned to grass for beef, and slaughtered in the\r\nfall without stall-feeding, and made merchantable beef.\r\n\r\nArabella, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to seventeen years old,\r\nand died in 1861, at eighteen years old.\r\n\r\nLilac 4th, a thorough-bred Cow, bred regularly up to nineteen years old,\r\nand died in 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scale of Points for Short Horn Bulls._\r\n\r\n                                                                   Points.\r\n\r\n  ART. 1.--Purity of breed on male and female side; sire and dam\r\n  reputed for docility of disposition, early maturity, and aptitude\r\n  to fatten.

The desire to obtain as large a representation\r\nof stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as\r\nwidely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the\r\nvarious classes of stock to hold open their books and the delays\r\nincident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a\r\nlong correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from\r\nfurnishing the copy to the Publication Committee, in season to have the\r\nwork finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records\r\nperfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed\r\nthis has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here\r\nrecorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.\r\n\r\n                                   H. A.

In a few\r\ninstances this latter has been impossible, and we have been obliged to\r\nbe content with tracing the pedigrees to the herds of well known\r\nbreeders, having their assurances that the animals in question were\r\nthorough-bred Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nMany breeders, who have taken the utmost pains, and have been at great\r\nexpense to keep their herds pure, have not been careful to keep accurate\r\nrecords of the pedigrees of their stock, feeling that as long as they\r\nthemselves were satisfied, their assurances would be sufficient to\r\nconvince purchasers. This course answered when there were but few cattle\r\nof this breed in the country, and the necessity of an organized effort\r\nto preserve the purity of the blood had not been recognized; but\r\nhereafter it is hoped that every one liberal enough to breed\r\nthorough-bred stock, will see the advantages and the necessity of a\r\nrecord of pedigrees, and assist in swelling the next edition of the\r\nwork, to a size more nearly commensurate with the importance of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe Committee thought best to have a short history of the Ayrshires,\r\ntogether with the points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural\r\nAssociation, printed as an introduction to the work, and applied to\r\nSanford Howard, Esq., of Boston, who kindly consented to write such an\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard's opportunities of studying this breed, both in Scotland and\r\nin this country have been such, that he is eminently fitted to write\r\nwith authority on the subject. The Committee did not follow his\r\nsuggestion and give in the Herd Book the lists of premiums taken by the\r\nanimals at the various Agricultural Fairs, knowing that many of the\r\npremiums in this country have been awarded for want of competition, and\r\nby judges not acquainted with the excellencies or the peculiarities of\r\nthe breed. Should this Society ever hold exhibitions, a record of the\r\npremiums taken at them would be of great value to breeders in selecting\r\nanimals for stock purposes.\r\n\r\n                    HENRY H.

BIRNIE, Springfield, Mass.,      }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE breed of cattle now know as the Ayrshire, undoubtedly originated in\r\nthe county of that name, in Scotland; but by what special means it was\r\nformed cannot be particularly told. Youatt (1835) says, \"A century ago\r\nthere was no such breed in Ayrshire or in Scotland;\" and he asks, \"Did\r\nthe [present] Ayrshire cattle arise entirely from a careful selection of\r\nthe native breed?\" adding, \"If they did it is a circumstance\r\nunparalleled in the history of agriculture. The native breed may be\r\nameliorated by careful selection; its value may be incalculably\r\nincreased; some good qualities may for the first time be developed; but\r\nyet there will be some resemblance to the original stock.\" A comparison\r\nof the modern breed with the description given by Aiton of the cattle\r\nwhich he says occupied Ayrshire fifty years before the time when he\r\nwrote (1806), will show that the difference is great. He says, \"The cows\r\nkept in the districts of Kyle and Cunningham [districts of Ayrshire],\r\nwere of a diminutive size, ill-fed, ill-shaped, and they yielded but a\r\nscanty return in milk; they were mostly of a black color, with stripes\r\nof white along the chine or ridge of their backs, about their flanks and\r\non their faces. Their horns were high and crooked, * * * their pile\r\n[hair] was coarse and open; and few of them yielded more than three or\r\nfour Scotch pints [six to eight wine quarts] of milk a day.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the Ayrshire cattle of to-day, will\r\nreadily admit that they present a wide contrast with the old stock,\r\naccording to the above description of the latter; and the suggestion of\r\nYouatt, that the present breed could not have arisen entirely by\r\nselection from the old, seems reasonable. It follows, then, that the\r\nAyrshire, like the modern or \"improved\" Short Horn breed, originated in\r\ncrossing. The question as to the breeds from which it was derived, will\r\nbe briefly considered, although the attempt will not be made to give\r\nprecise details on this point.\r\n\r\nVarious accounts represent that the Earl of Marchmont, some time between\r\n1724 and 1740, introduced to his estates, in Berwickshire, some cattle,\r\nconjectured (their history was not positively known) to be of the\r\nHolderness or Teeswater breed, and that, not long afterwards, some of\r\nthe stock was carried to estates belonging to the same nobleman, in that\r\npart of Ayrshire called Kyle. But, perhaps, the main nucleus of the\r\nimproved breed was the \"Dunlop stock,\" so called, which appears to have\r\nbeen possessed by a distinguished family by the name of Dunlop, in the\r\nCunningham District of Ayrshire, as early as 1780. This stock, it is\r\nsaid, was derived, at least in part, from animals imported from Holland.\r\nThe Dunlop cows soon became noted. Rawlin (as quoted by Youatt), who\r\nwrote in 1794, speaking of the cattle of Ayrshire, says, \"They have\r\nanother breed, called the Dunlop, which are allowed to be the best race\r\nfor yielding milk in Great Britain, or Ireland, not only for large\r\nquantities, but also for richness and quality.\" This, though extravagant\r\npraise, perhaps, shows that the stock possessed remarkable qualities at\r\nthat early day. It was, indeed, held in great esteem still earlier. In\r\nYouatt's Treatise, it is mentioned, when speaking of the cattle of\r\nDumfrieshire, that the poet Burns, when he occupied a farm near the city\r\nof Dumfries, \"not content with the Galloway breed, introduced some of\r\nthe West-Country cows, which he thought would produce more milk.\" In\r\nthe poet's published correspondence, allusion is made, in a letter dated\r\nNovember 13th, 1788, to a heifer which had been presented to him by the\r\nproprietor of Dunlop House, as \"the finest quey in Ayrshire.\" Mrs.\r\nDunlop, it will be remembered, was a special friend and correspondent of\r\nthe poet.[A]\r\n\r\nCol. Le Couteur, in a paper on the Jersey or Alderney cow, published in\r\nthe Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, refers to a statement by\r\nQuayle, that the Ayrshire was a cross of the Short Horn and Alderney;\r\nand adds himself that \"there is a considerable affinity between the two\r\nbreeds.\" Rawlin also says, in reference to the Ayrshire breed, \"It is\r\nsaid to be a mixture by bulls brought from the island of Alderney, with\r\ntheir own or the old race of cows.\" Martin says, \"At some period or\r\nother there has evidently been a cross with the Durham or Holderness,\r\nand, perhaps, also with the Alderney.\" Professor Low, in his\r\n\"Illustrations of British Quadrupeds,\" says, \"From all the evidence\r\nwhich, in the absence of authentic documents, the case admits of, the\r\ndairy breed of Ayrshire cows, owes the characters which distinguish it\r\nfrom the older race, to a mixture of the blood of the races of the\r\ncontinent and of the dairy breed of Alderney.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, the authorities quoted have, doubtless, given the main facts in\r\nregard to the originals of the present Ayrshire cattle. But there is\r\nevidence that the present leading type of the breed was formed, in part,\r\nby an infusion of the blood of the Kyloe, or West-Highland breed. This\r\nappeared in the first instance, probably, in what has been called the\r\nSwinley variety. The facts, which the writer has obtained in Scotland in\r\nregard to it, are substantially as follows: Theophilus Parton, of\r\nSwinley Farm, near Dairy, Ayrshire, about forty to forty-five years ago,\r\ntook great pains to establish a herd of what were deemed the _best_\r\nAyrshire cattle, into which he infused a strain of the West-Highland\r\nblood, the particular degree of which is not publicly or generally\r\nknown. The Swinley stock differs from the older Ayrshire in having a\r\nshorter head, with more breadth across the eyes, more upright and\r\nspreading horns, more hair, and generally better constitutions. They are\r\nalso somewhat smaller boned than the old stock, though from their\r\nsuperior symmetry, and greater tendency to fatten, they are fully equal\r\nto the former in weight of carcass when slaughtered.\r\n\r\nThe following points given by the Ayrshire Agricultural Association,\r\n1853, \"as indicating superior quality,\" will give an idea of the\r\nstandard for Ayrshire cattle, as recognized by the leading breeders:\r\n\r\nHead short, forehead wide, nose fine between the muzzle and the eyes;\r\nmuzzle moderately large, eyes full and lively, horns widely set on,\r\ninclining upwards and curving slightly inwards.\r\n\r\nNeck long and straight from the head to the top of the shoulders, free\r\nfrom loose skin on the underside, fine at its junction with the head,\r\nand the muscles symmetrically enlarging towards the shoulders.\r\n\r\nShoulders thin at the top, brisket light, the whole fore-quarter thin in\r\nfront and gradually increasing in depth and width backwards.\r\n\r\nBack short and straight, spine well defined, especially at the\r\nshoulders, short ribs arched, the body deep at the flanks, and the\r\nmilk-veins well developed.\r\n\r\nPelvis long, broad and straight, hook [or hip] bones wide apart, and not\r\nmuch overlaid with fat, thighs deep and broad, tail long and slender,\r\nand set on a level with the back.\r\n\r\nMilk-vessel [udder] capacious and extending well forward, hinder-part\r\nbroad and firmly attached to the body, the sole or under surface nearly\r\nlevel. The teats from two to two and a half inches in length, equal in\r\nthickness, and hanging perpendicularly; their distance apart at the\r\nsides should be equal to about one-third the length of the vessel, and\r\nacross to about one-half the breadth.\r\n\r\nLegs short, the bones fine and the joints firm.\r\n\r\nSkin soft and elastic, and covered with soft, close and woolly hair.\r\n\r\nThe colors preferred are brown, or brown and white, the colors being\r\ndistinctly defined. Weight of the animal, when fattened, about forty\r\nimperial stones, sinking the offal [that is 560 pounds], the quarters or\r\nmeat only.\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, it will be understood, that the dairy\r\nis the leading object with the breeders of Ayrshires. At the same time\r\nthe fact has not been overlooked, that to breed and perpetuate a\r\nprofitable dairy stock, regard must be had to hardiness and strength of\r\nconstitution, and also to such fattening tendencies as will insure a\r\nprofitable return from calves fattened for veal, from steers reared for\r\nbeef, and for cows, which having served their turn in the dairy, are at\r\nlast dried of their milk and prepared for the shambles. The importance\r\nof these properties is not sufficiently regarded by keepers of dairy\r\nstock in this country. The remark has not unfrequently been heard that\r\nthe \"_looks_ of a cow are nothing.\" People who hold this absurd notion\r\nwill never be distinguished for breeding profitable dairy stock. Even if\r\nmilk were the sole object, it would be impossible to preserve a breed\r\npossessing superior qualities, in this respect, without giving attention\r\nto those points of form which denote strength of constitution. It has\r\nbeen well observed by Magne, that in the breeding of dairy stock, we\r\nshould \"make choice only of animals possessing the _two-fold character\r\nof general vigor, and activity of the mammary system_.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading breeders of Ayrshire, in Scotland, have followed these\r\nprinciples to some extent, if not to the full degree to which they\r\nshould be observed. Hence, they claim a high rank for the breed in\r\nreference to general usefulness. Aiton, speaking of what the Ayrshire\r\ncow would do, says, \"She yields much milk, and that of an oily or\r\nbutyraceous, or caseous nature, and after she has yielded very large\r\nquantities of milk for several years, she shall be as valuable for beef\r\nas any other breed of cows known; her fat shall be much more mixed\r\nthrough the whole flesh, and she shall fatten faster than any other.\"\r\nWhatever may be said in regard to the extent of these claims, it will be\r\nadmitted that they indicate the confidence which was long ago placed in\r\nthe breed in regard to the properties mentioned. Youatt, who wrote\r\ntwenty-five years after Aiton, says, \"The breed has been much improved\r\nsince Mr. Aiton described it.\" It is thirty years since Mr. Youatt made\r\nthis remark, and in this time the breed has been still further improved\r\nin reference to general usefulness. I have been assured by some of the\r\nmost experienced breeders in Scotland, that while nothing has been lost\r\non the score of dairy properties, considerable has been gained in\r\nhardiness and thrift, and in the faculty of giving a greater return,\r\nboth in milk and flesh, for the food consumed. Of course it is the\r\nreturn obtained in proportion to the food eaten, that constitutes the\r\ntrue criterion of value in all animals.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the calves of the Ayrshire breed, that are not wanted for\r\nkeeping up the breeding or dairy stock, are either fattened for veal, or\r\nturned for beef at an early age. The larger portion, perhaps, of the\r\nmales are killed for veal. In fact, in some districts, veal is an\r\narticle of considerable importance, and the ability of Ayrshire cows to\r\nmake fat calves is considered one of the excellencies of the breed. Thus\r\nHaxton observes, \"For all medium soils and climates throughout the\r\nUnited Kingdom, there is no breed equal to the Ayrshire, for profit,\r\nwhether the produce is converted into cheese, butter, or _veal_.\" A\r\nportion of the males are castrated and fattened when about three to\r\nthree and half years old. Scotch farmers, who are in the practice of\r\nfattening stock of various breeds, assured me that Ayrshire steers of\r\nthis age fattened to as much profit as any, reaching the weight of 700\r\nto 800 pounds the four quarters, and afforded beef excelled in quality\r\nonly by the Galloways and the West-Highlanders.\r\n\r\nAt present the Ayrshire cattle have not been tried in America to a great\r\nextent. There have been various importations, mostly made within the\r\nlast twenty years, and so far as there have been such trials as would\r\njustify a conclusion in regard to their merits, they have answered all\r\nreasonable expectations. The leading object in keeping them here is the\r\nsame as it is in Scotland--the dairy--but their ability to fatten\r\nreadily and make beef of good quality, should be taken into\r\nconsideration in estimating their value. In regard to the latter\r\nproperty, but few trials have as yet been made here. Most of the males\r\nhave been kept for bulls, and the females have seldom been fattened till\r\ntoo far advanced in years to breed. It may be worthy of consideration,\r\nwhether it would not be an object to give some good steers of the breed\r\na fair chance to show what they could make in beef at three to four\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nIt is also desirable to ascertain what are the capabilities of the breed\r\nin regard to the performance of labor. On this point we are without any\r\nevidence from abroad, as oxen are not worked in Scotland. The results of\r\nthe few trials that have been made with full-bloods, have been highly\r\nfavorable in reference to the qualities of the breed for this purpose.\r\nJudging by their points, there is no reason why Ayrshire oxen should not\r\nbe equal to any others, of their size, for any kind of labor. They have\r\nclean, firm legs, well-placed muscles, and are remarkably quick walkers.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a Registry, or Herd Book, for this breed of cattle,\r\nare too obvious to require argument. For the Short Horns, Herefords, and\r\nDevons, registers have been prepared, and the benefits which have been\r\nderived therefrom are such as will insure their continuance. An accurate\r\nrecord of the pedigrees of animals, together with a record of such\r\npremiums as they may have taken, cannot fail to afford a guide, to some\r\nextent, in breeding with reference to special objects--the principle,\r\nthat \"Like begets Like,\" being admitted as a general law. The subject of\r\npublishing a Herd Book for Ayrshires, in Scotland, has been agitated on\r\nseveral occasions, but, down to the present time, no direct action has\r\nbeen taken on it. The enterprise of the American breeders of this\r\nvariety of cattle, in taking the lead in this matter, is highly\r\ncreditable, and, if properly followed up, will be sure to bring a just\r\nrecompense of reward.\r\n\r\n                                                    S.

Thus his efforts to procure the\r\nAyrshire cow, shows that they had, even at that time, a high reputation\r\nfor this object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERD RECORD ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nBREEDERS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHOROUGH-BRED NEAT STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAYRSHIRES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1 Albert,=\r\n\r\nBrownish red and white; calved Autumn of 1856; bred by JAMES HENDRIE,\r\nDrummock, Scotland; imported by the Trustees of the Massachusetts\r\nSociety for the Promotion of Agriculture, 1859; owned at the STATE\r\nREFORM SCHOOL, Westboro', Mass.: Sire, Jock, bred by Mr. Borrie, of\r\nRiccarton, 2d Sire, Geordie, bred by Mr. Hendrie, Dam, Kirstie, by\r\nGeordie, 2d Dam, Nancy, by Kilburnie.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2 Alfred,=\r\n\r\nBrownish red; calved November 18th, 1859; bred by the Trustees of the\r\nMassachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture; owned by T.

The desire to obtain as large a representation\r\nof stock as possible, and to extend the advantages of the Association as\r\nwidely among breeders as they could, has induced the committees on the\r\nvarious classes of stock to hold open their books and the delays\r\nincident upon tracing doubtful pedigrees, through in many instances a\r\nlong correspondence with owners and breeders, have prevented them from\r\nfurnishing the copy to the Publication Committee, in season to have the\r\nwork finished sooner. Every care has been taken to have the records\r\nperfect, and to admit no pedigrees of doubtful character. It is believed\r\nthis has been successfully accomplished, and that the animals here\r\nrecorded may be relied upon as of undoubted purity of blood.\r\n\r\nH. A. DYER, } _Committee_ S. I.

That the Devons are an ancient race of\r\ncattle, there can be no doubt. There is no race in England that can\r\nclaim such undisputed antiquity. They bear all the characteristic marks\r\nof resemblance of the ancient races of the south of England and Wales;\r\neven the color, red, is traced in the Devon, Sussex and Hereford.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between a \"breed\" and \"race,\" Goodale defines as\r\nfollows: \"By breeds are understood such varieties as were originally\r\nproduced by a cross or mixture, and subsequently established by\r\nselecting for breeding purposes only the best specimens, and rejecting\r\nall others. In process of time deviations become less frequent, and\r\ngreater uniformity is secured, and this is in proportion to the time\r\nwhich elapses and the skill employed in selecting. Races are varieties\r\nmoulded to their peculiar type by _natural_ causes, with no interference\r\nof man, and no intermixture of other varieties; that have continued\r\nsubstantially the same, for a period beyond which the memory and\r\nknowledge of man does not reach. Such are the North Devon Cattle.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been three distinct races of these ancient cattle:\r\nthe Long Horns, the Middle Horns, and Hornless, or Polled Cattle. The\r\nMiddle Horns represented the cattle of the region of Devonshire. These\r\nraces of cattle were bred by the Ancient Celtic inhabitants, and\r\nconstituted their chief subsistence. Youatt says: \"the native\r\ninhabitants were proud of their country, and prouder of their cattle,\r\ntheir choicest possession.\" When their country was invaded by their\r\nenemies, they fled to the mountains for safety and protection, and took\r\nwith them their cattle upon which to subsist, and thus were preserved\r\nboth themselves and their cattle, so that the races of cattle in these\r\ndistricts have been the same from time immemorial. In a few instances\r\nthe wild forest cattle have been kept distinct, in a wild state, to this\r\nday; as in the parks of Chillingham and Chartley; and are said to be\r\nsimilar to those that existed in the tenth century; and also bear a\r\nstrong resemblance to the present domestic breeds of that region. The\r\ncattle in these parks are white, with red ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color._\r\n\r\nBlack or white were the principal colors, though where these were found\r\nthe memory of the red prevails. \"It seems the people had a superstitious\r\nreverence attached to it, (in Scotland and Wales), in the tradition of\r\nthe country; the milk of the red cow was considered a remedy for every\r\ndisease, and a preservative from every evil.\" The breeders of the\r\nimproved Devons adhere scrupulously to the deep red color of the hair,\r\nand reject individuals that have a tendency to produce white. And it\r\nseems that in this way, if no other, the color of the Devons has been\r\nestablished and perpetuated. The deep red color of the pure bred Devon\r\nis implanted so strongly, that there is no race in which an admixture of\r\nforeign blood is so easily traced; nor is there a race that has remained\r\nso free from foreign intermixture. Their color is generally stamped on\r\nthe progeny, in a cross with any other breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_English Improved Devons._\r\n\r\nThe improvement of these ancient races of cattle, which has resulted in\r\nthe present perfected breed, was commenced about one hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago. John Tanner Davy, of Rose Ash, England, the Editor of the\r\nEnglish Devon Herd Book, inherited the herd of his father, who had\r\ncarefully bred the Devons for fifty years. Mr. Francis Quartly, whose\r\nengraving adorns the first volume of Davy's Devon Herd Book, endeavored\r\nby a long course of selection, and by an intimate knowledge of the\r\nprinciples of breeding, to combine the various elements in the different\r\nherds, so as to attain the great object of the Devon breeder, the\r\nlessening of the parts of the animal frame least useful to man, as the\r\nbone and offal, and at the same time the increase of such other parts,\r\nas fat and flesh, that furnish food, and to do this at the earliest\r\npossible age, and with the least consumption of food. That Mr. Quartly\r\nsucceeded in fully establishing these characteristics of the breed, we\r\nneed no better evidence than that nine-tenths of the pedigrees of the\r\npresent herds in Davy's Herd Book, go directly back to the old Quartly\r\nstock; twenty-seven out of twenty-nine of the prize bulls mentioned in\r\nthat work are descendants from the bull Forester, (46): and twenty-nine\r\nout of thirty-four prize cows mentioned there, descended from the cow\r\nCurly, (92). Hundred Guinea (56), another noted ancestor of the Quartly\r\ntribe, stands in the pedigrees of this breed, as Hubback among the short\r\nhorns. Among others who have done much to improve their herds, and bring\r\nthe breed to its present state of perfection, may be mentioned, the Earl\r\nof Leicester, James Davy, Mr. Richard Merson, James and John Quartly who\r\nalso inherited the herds of their fathers, and continued their well\r\nbegun improvement. Mr. George Turner, of Barton, whose herd was made up\r\nfrom the other breeders, Mr. Samuel Farthing, of Somerset, Mr. John\r\nHalse, of Moland, Mr. Wm. Hole, of Somerset, Mr. T. B. Morle, of\r\nCummington, Mr. George Shapland, of Oakford, and Mr. John Ayre Thomas,\r\nof Rose Ash, Devon, with many others have caught the spirit of\r\nimprovement, and continued to progress towards perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Qualities._\r\n\r\nMr. Bloomfield, the manager of the late Earl of Leicester's estate, at\r\nHolkam Hall, Norfolk, England, has, by careful attention, greatly\r\nimproved the size and quality of the Devons, and increased their milking\r\nproperties, so that he obtained a prize for having produced an average\r\nannual yield of 200 pounds of butter per cow, in a dairy of twenty cows,\r\nor equal to four pounds per week the year round; and he offered to milk\r\nforty pure Devons from his own herd against an equal number of cows in\r\nany one herd of any breed found in England, without finding a\r\ncompetitor. At the Smithfield show of fat cattle, held at the London\r\nmarket place, in 1858, the gold medal for the best ox or steer of any\r\nbreed in the show yard was awarded to a Devon, bred and owned by the\r\nEarl of Leicester. They are highly esteemed in the Smithfield market,\r\nnot only for the excellence of the meat, but because its size is more\r\nagreeable on most tables than the huge joints of some other breeds. In\r\nweight they are much excelled, but the opinion of the Devon breeder is,\r\nthat more meat can be made from them, with a given amount of food, than\r\nfrom any other breed. The quality of the Devon beef is unsurpassed, even\r\nrivalling the little black West Highland ox, in the estimation of the\r\nLondon west-end butcher, whose fastidious customers oblige him to kill\r\nnone but beef of the finest quality and flavor. In the New York market\r\nthe \"red oxen of Connecticut\" most generally bring the highest price,\r\nthey being Devon Grades. The Devons have the preference of all other\r\nbreeds for the yoke, being strong, active, and of great endurance; and\r\nare remarkable for docility and good temper.\r\n\r\nThe cattle in many sections of New England resemble the Devons in many\r\nrespects, and the fact that most of the early settlers were from the\r\nsouth of England, renders it quite probable that they selected their\r\ncattle from that region. The first account that we have of the\r\nimportation of cattle into New England was in the ship Charity, in the\r\nspring of 1623, in the care of Mr Winslow, then agent of the colony of\r\nPlymouth. Their descendants show by their color that they were Devons,\r\nor Devon grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n_American Improved Devons._\r\n\r\nThe first importation of improved North Devons into this country was in\r\n1817. Mr. Coke, then Earl of Leicester, presented to Mr. Robert\r\nPatterson, of Baltimore, Md., six heifers and one bull, Taurus (320).\r\nTaurus was bred by Mr. Denny, a tenant of Mr. Coke, then Earl of\r\nLeicester, who paid fifty guineas for him. His dam, in 1820, made\r\nthirteen pounds of butter per week. Three of these heifers Mr. Patterson\r\ngave to his father-in-law, Mr. Richard Caton, the other three he gave to\r\nhis father, Mr. William Patterson; they were all bred to Taurus. In\r\n1835, Mr. George Patterson came in possession of the herd of his father,\r\nMr. William Patterson, and, in 1836, imported the bull Anchises (140),\r\nfor a cross, from one of the best dairies in Devonshire; he afterward\r\nimported Eclipse (191); in 1846, Herod (214), and in 1852, Norfolk\r\n(266). By comparing the records the fact is apparent, that the pedigree\r\nof animals dates further back in this country than in England. Thus the\r\nbull Taurus (320), was calved in 1816, and imported in 1817, when a\r\nyearling, by Mr. Robert Patterson, of Md.; Holkham (215), calved 1819;\r\nthe cow Fancy (709), calved 1818, and Strawberry 1st (1062), calved\r\n1819. While the oldest record of English pedigrees is the bull Forester\r\n(46), calved in 1827, and Hundred Guineas (56), calved in 1837; the cows\r\nFlower (187), calved in 1820, Countess (77), in 1828, Curly (92), and\r\nPretty Maid (364), were calved in 1830. Messrs. S. & L. Hurlbut, of\r\nWinchester, Conn., commenced their herd in 1819, from a pair procured of\r\nMr. Patterson, Holkham (115), and Fancy (709), with additions from the\r\nsame source every few years. In 1850 they imported Albert (2), whose\r\nprogeny has stood high in the country, and received more premiums than\r\nthe progeny of any other bull lately imported. Beauty (523), bred by Mr.\r\nHurlbut, in 1836, from Fancy (709), and Exchange (197), produced sixteen\r\npounds of butter per week, in June, 1850. Mr. Coleman, says, in his\r\nEuropean Agriculture, \"the most productive cow in butter, which I have\r\nfound, was a North Devon, which, for several weeks in succession,\r\nwithout extra feed, produced twenty-one pounds of butter per week. The\r\ncharacter of the owner places the fact beyond a doubt.\"\r\n\r\nMr. L. F. Allen, of Black Rock, N. Y., commenced breeding in 1835, from\r\nstock obtained from the Hon. James L. King, of New York, whose father\r\nimported them about the year 1819, from the herd of the Earl of\r\nLeicester; in 1842 he added to his herd from Mr. Patterson's stock. In\r\n1844 the Massachusetts Society for the Promotion of Agriculture imported\r\nfour cows and one bull, Bloomfield (372), from the Earl of Leicester.\r\nThey were boarded and bred for the Society on the farm of Elias Phiney,\r\nof Lexington, till his death, the object being to present a pair to each\r\nof the County Societies in the State. In 1848, Mr. C. S. Wainwright, of\r\nRhinebeck, N. Y., commenced importing and breeding his herd; his first\r\nimportation was the bull Megunticook (251), and the cows Nonpareil\r\n(924), and Helena (774); Helena gave as high as twenty-two quarts of\r\nmilk per day, and made fifteen pounds of butter per week. In 1851 he\r\nimported May Boy (71), whose granddam, Old May Flower, made over\r\nseventeen pounds of butter per week. In 1853, Mr. George Vail, of Troy,\r\nN. Y., imported one bull and two heifers from the herds of Mr. Davy and\r\nthe Earl of Leicester. In 1850 and '52, Col. L. G. Morris, of New York,\r\nimported animals from the herds of the Earl of Leicester, the Messrs.\r\nQuartly and John Ayer Thomas. Abijah Catlin, of Conn., imported in 1851,\r\nRubens (116), and two heifers. Many others have imported animals equally\r\nmeritorious, among whom may be mentioned, Ambrose Stevens, of Batavia,\r\nN. Y., E. G. Faile, West Farms, N. Y., R. Linsley, West Meriden, Conn.,\r\nR. W. Sanford, Orwell, Vt., E. P. Beck, Sheldon, N. Y., and R. H. Van\r\nRensselaer, of Morris, N. Y. Importations have occurred almost annually\r\nup to the present year. These importations, with many others not\r\nmentioned, are sufficient to form the basis of a superior race of Devons\r\nin America, not excelled by those in any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Devon Herd Book._\r\n\r\nThe _First Herd Book_ of the Devons was published in 1851, by John\r\nTanner Davy, of Rose Ash, near Southmolton, Devon, England. The\r\npedigrees of 132 bulls and 483 cows, in all 615 animals, were recorded;\r\nall bred in England, and contributed by thirty-seven different breeders.\r\n\r\nThe _second volume_, published in 1854, contained the pedigrees of 221\r\nbulls and 657 cows, 837 animals in all; and was edited by Mr. Davy, in\r\nEngland, and Sanford Howard, in America, comprising animals bred and\r\nowned in both countries, sixty breeders contributing in England, and\r\neighteen in America.\r\n\r\nThe _third volume_ was published in 1859, on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nby Messrs. Davy and Howard, independent of each other, Mr. Davy's third\r\nvolume recorded 204 bulls and 609 cows, in all 810 pedigrees, from\r\nforty-one different herds in England, and eight in America. Mr. Howard's\r\nrecorded 258 bulls and 399 cows, in all 657 pedigrees, from eighty-four\r\ndifferent herds, and all from America.\r\n\r\nThe whole number recorded to the end of Howard's third volume is 2150\r\nanimals, comprising 611 bulls, and 1539 cows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_American Devon Herd Book._\r\n\r\nThe present work, the first volume of the American Devon Herd Book,\r\npublished in March, 1863, under the direction of the Association of\r\nBreeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock, was commenced about two years\r\nsince. It has progressed amid many discouraging circumstances, to say\r\nnothing of the jealousy occasioned by the locality of its origin; and\r\nhas gradually won upon public confidence till the present time. It has\r\nbeen the design of the Committee on Devon pedigrees to perfect a Devon\r\nHerd Book that would meet the wants of all American Breeders of Devon\r\ncattle. To accomplish this they have been untiring in their labors,\r\nsparing no pains to thoroughly investigate each pedigree; and have\r\ndecided upon each, according to the facts received from the testimony\r\ngiven. While some have been rejected, others have been deferred till\r\nmore light can be given to prove their purity of blood, which may be\r\ndone in season for the second volume. How far the Committee have\r\naccomplished their designs the present volume will show for itself. It\r\nis a relief, however, to the Committee to know, that the errors which\r\nmay occur, can be corrected in future volumes, or the present volume can\r\nbe perfected and republished. It was also designed to make _this_ the\r\nfirst of a series of volumes, to be published once in four years, or as\r\noften as the wants of the Devon breeders demand; and that would be\r\nworthy of the title of the American Devon Herd Book, and receive the\r\nuniversal patronage of all the Breeders of Devon Stock in America.\r\n\r\nConsidering the state of the country, and that the attention and time of\r\nthe great mass of the people are engaged in the all-absorbing and\r\ndreadful reality, civil war, and that many of our breeders and importers\r\nof Devon stock are personally engaged in their country's service, and\r\nthat all the Southern States of our Union have withdrawn themselves from\r\nall connection with the Northern; considering all this, the breeders of\r\nThorough-Bred Devon Stock have contributed for the work far beyond our\r\nmost sanguine hopes. _Fifteen states_ are represented in this work by\r\n_fifty-three_ different breeders, with the pedigrees of 151 bulls and\r\n350 cows, making in all 501 animals which are recorded in this volume,\r\nand all owned in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF EXCELLENCE\r\n\r\nIN A\r\n\r\n=NORTH DEVON BULL.=\r\n\r\n\r\nPurity of blood indispensable;

The very dark red being less thrifty, and\r\n  generally hard handlers; while the very light red, with a thin\r\n  papery skin are less hardy in a cold climate.                        1\r\n\r\n  ART. 20.--_Hair_, should be soft, thick and fine, and not much\r\n  curly.                                                               2\r\n\r\n  ART. 21.--_Carriage_, this is an important quality in the Devon,\r\n  as he is destined for the yoke, as well as for the butcher.

If the handling be good, some deficiency in minor\r\n  qualities may be excused; but if it be hard and stiff, nothing\r\n  can compensate for so unpromising a feature. In raising the skin\r\n  from the body between the thumb and finger, it should present a\r\n  soft, flexible and substantial feel, and pressed by the out\r\n  spread hand it should move easily with and under it, as if\r\n  resting on a soft, elastic, cellular substance, which becomes\r\n  firmer as the animal ripens.                                        15\r\n                                                                     ---\r\n  Perfection.                                                        100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF EXCELLENCE\r\n\r\nIN A\r\n\r\nDEVON COW.\r\n\r\nPurity of blood indispensable.\r\n\r\n                                                                   Points.\r\n\r\n  ART. 1.--_Head_, should be lean and bony; forehead wide and\r\n  somewhat dishing between the eyes; face straight but not long.       2\r\n\r\n  ART. 2.--_Nose_, of a light orange color; a black or mottled nose\r\n  should be rejected.                                                  3\r\n\r\n  ART. 3.--_Eye_, should be bright, prominent and clear, surrounded\r\n  by a bright orange colored ring.                                     3\r\n\r\n  ART. 4.--_Ear_, thin, rather below medium size, orange color\r\n  within, with a quick movement, expressive of attention.              2\r\n\r\n  ART. 5.--_Horns_, light, tapering, of a waxy color, somewhat long\r\n  and spreading gaily towards the tips.                                2\r\n\r\n  ART. 6.--_Neck_, clean in the throat, fine at the junction with\r\n  the head, and full at the shoulder.                                  2\r\n\r\n  ART. 7.--_Chest_, deep and round, carrying its fulness well back\r\n  of the elbows, thus affording abundant internal room for the\r\n  action of the heart and lungs.                                       6\r\n\r\n  ART. 8.--_Brisket_, full and round, spreading the fore legs well\r\n  at the junction with the body; not projecting, but forming a\r\n  regular slant, without dewlap, to the throat.                        4\r\n\r\n  ART. 9.--_Shoulder_, in this breed is a beautiful and important\r\n  point, and should in a degree approximate to that of the horse;\r\n  with points less prominent and in a more sloping position than in\r\n  most other breeds, indicative of activity and good traveling\r\n  quality.                                                             5\r\n\r\n  ART. 10.--_Crops_, full and even, forming a line with the\r\n  shoulder and back, extending well down the shoulder blade so as\r\n  to prevent a cavity between the shoulder and the barrel.             5\r\n\r\n  ART. 11.--_Back_, full, loin broad, with the short bones\r\n  extending full to the hoop ribs; hip bones wide and on a level\r\n  with the sacrum, and setting on of the tail.                         8\r\n\r\n  ART. 12.--_Rumps_, broad, full, and well covered.                    3\r\n\r\n  ART. 13.--_Escutcheon_, this should be broad, maintaining an even\r\n  breadth from the udder to the sacrum.                                8\r\n\r\n  ART. 14.--_Quarters_, long, and well filled between the hip bones\r\n  and the rumps, with a good muscular development at a regular\r\n  slant to the hocks.                                                  6\r\n\r\n  A pork ham objectionable.\r\n\r\n  ART. 15.--_Flanks_, moderately deep, full and mellow in\r\n  proportion to condition.                                             4\r\n\r\n  ART. 16.--_Legs_, fore legs of medium length, spread wide at the\r\n  brisket, straight, with well developed, round, muscular arm,\r\n  firmly knit at the knee, fine shank bone with large sinews,\r\n  drawing nearer together as they approach the feet; hind legs with\r\n  a gradual taper from the patella to the gambrel joint, which\r\n  should be wide, leg below, fine and flat, with large sinews,\r\n  forming an angle of thirty-three degrees, and moving in a\r\n  straight line with the fore legs.                                    5\r\n\r\n  Crooked knees or gambrels, causing an outward projection of the\r\n  feet, deduct 3.\r\n\r\n  ART. 17.--_Tail_, set on full and round, at a level with the\r\n  back, small in the cord, and finishing with a tassel of white\r\n  hair.                                                                2\r\n\r\n  ART. 18.--_Carcass_ or _Barrel_, round and straight, its\r\n  posterior ribs springing nearly horizontal from the vertebra,\r\n  with less curve as they approach the posterior plates, with full\r\n  and well developed anterior plates covering deep the springing\r\n  rib.                                                                 4\r\n\r\n  ART. 19.--_Color_, always red, but of different shades. A medium\r\n  red should be preferred; the very dark red coming slower to\r\n  maturity, their beef of poorer quality, of less weight, and\r\n  inferior milking qualities; the light red less hardy, but claim\r\n  earlier maturity and superior beef qualities. Some white about\r\n  the udder is common to all the various shades, but confined to\r\n  that part alone. In all cases the color grows lighter about the\r\n  muzzle, while a color, verging almost to a black and growing yet\r\n  darker about the head, always was a very objectionable color for\r\n  the true North Devon, and when accompanied with a dark nose\r\n  should be rejected.                                                  2\r\n\r\n  ART. 20.--_--Hair_, should be short, thick, and fine; even\r\n  throughout the body, and short about the head; a long, coarse\r\n  foretop, accompanied by harsh, wiry hair elsewhere,\r\n  objectionable.                                                       2\r\n\r\n  ART. 21.--_Udder_, should be wide and well spread, projecting\r\n  well forward and back, wide between the teats but not hanging;\r\n  with milk veins large and extending well forward. 9\r\n\r\n  ART. 22.--_Carriage_, the Devons having, from their excellence in\r\n  the yoke, another destiny besides that of the butcher's block, it\r\n  is important that the animal's carriage should indicate as much;\r\n  to obtain this, something of the heavy, inert, squarely moulded\r\n  frame of the merely beefing animal must be relinquished for a\r\n  lighter and more active frame.                                       3\r\n\r\n  ART. 23.--_Quality_, to combine this with the other highly\r\n  important and characteristic properties of the Devon, requires no\r\n  small skill, observation, and care in the breeder. For without\r\n  this, in the eye of the experienced grazier and butcher, the\r\n  animal is considered nearly worthless. No beauty of form can\r\n  compensate for a hard, stiff feature, unyielding to the touch.\r\n  The skin should have, when pressed between the thumb and finger,\r\n  a mellow, yet substantial feel, and when beneath the outspread\r\n  hand it should move easily with it, back and forth, as though\r\n  resting on a soft, elastic, cellular substance, which becomes\r\n  firmer as the animal ripens, forming a beautiful marbled beef,\r\n  which is highly esteemed in the London market.                      10\r\n  A thin papery skin is objectionable in a cold climate.             ---\r\n  Perfection.                                                        100\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Scale of Points of Devon Cattle which the Association has\r\nadopted, is mainly that published by the New York State Agricultural\r\nSociety, with such alterations and additions as the Committee deemed\r\nproper. The numbers affixed to the points described form the _maximum_\r\nthat is allowed for each; and in proportion as the animal under\r\nexamination is deficient in any point, so must the number be decreased,\r\neven should nothing be allowed for that point. Points which are\r\ncharacteristic, and therefore _common to the breed_, though very\r\nvaluable in themselves, are marked comparatively low, because they are\r\neasily obtained, and demand but little attention on the part of the\r\nbreeder; nevertheless an animal _not_ possessing the characteristics of\r\n_the breed_, must of necessity be almost worthless.

This was retained. Some of the names were probably misprints such\r\nas the occurrence of both Phatasie and Phantassie, but, as each only\r\noccurred once and you may name a cow whatever you like, these were\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nFirst section:\r\n\r\nPage 6, \"Rotch, F.
