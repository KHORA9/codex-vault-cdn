GANT, General Manager, Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville,\r\nTennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen: It is a distinct pleasure to\r\nwelcome you to Norris and to the Tennessee Valley. You have had very\r\nfine weather here, and we hope that you will enjoy the climate and the\r\nscenery and the fishing and the pleasures of this part of the country\r\nduring your short stay.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers Association is a much older organization than I\r\nhad thought, and it is much older than the Tennessee Valley Authority,\r\nbut a review of some of the things, you have done and some of the\r\ninterests you have expressed from time to time indicate that we have\r\nmany interests in common, your organization and the TVA.\r\n\r\nYou are concerned with experimentation of new and better ways of growing\r\ntree crops. You are concerned with the environment in which tree crops\r\nmust find a place in our economy and in our culture, because, as I\r\nunderstand it, your interest goes beyond mere economics to the full use\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\nNow, the Tennessee Valley Authority is likewise concerned with\r\nexperimentation. As a matter of fact, it is an experiment, a new and\r\ndifferent way of achieving a better use of natural resources.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new in what the TVA does. There are no activities\r\nconducted by TVA that have not been or are not being conducted by other\r\nagencies all over the country and which have been conducted by Federal\r\nagencies for many, many years. The TVA has no new regulatory or coercive\r\nfunctions. As a matter of fact, the TVA has no coercive functions. It\r\nhas no new or unique or different governmental functions. There is only\r\none thing that is different about TVA, and that is the way in which it\r\napproaches the job of resource use on an overall basis.\r\n\r\nNow, I might illustrate that by referring to the construction of dams\r\nand reservoirs. In the Tennessee Valley the TVA builds dams and\r\nreservoirs to prevent floods, to produce a navigable channel, to produce\r\npower, and in its reservoirs it also has the responsibility of\r\nachieving the best uses of reservoirs and reservoir lands in the\r\ninterests of fish and wild life, in the interests of recreation, and in\r\nthe interests of malaria control.\r\n\r\nNow, the unique fact here is not that these things are going on or being\r\ndone, at least in part, through a Federal agency, but that one Federal\r\nagency is responsible for achieving a balance between all of these\r\nactivities and with the administrative responsibility for doing that. In\r\nother efforts the situation is different, with as many as eight agencies\r\nhaving something to do with the development of some one of these\r\nactivities in a way which might or might not be integrated.\r\n\r\nNow, the second illustration, I think, is that unity can be accomplished\r\nonly if all of the agencies which are concerned with the use of\r\nresources have an environment in which they can work effectively. The\r\nFederal Government is not and should not in the Tennessee Valley be\r\ndeveloping all of these resources itself. It feels that the unified\r\ndevelopment of the resources depends upon the participation of the\r\npeople of the Tennessee Valley and their institutions, the local and the\r\nstate agencies. There can't be unity any more if local agencies are\r\nconducting one program and a Federal agency conducting another program,\r\nthan there can be if several Federal agencies are conducting several\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Tennessee Valley Authority, except for the operation\r\nof these huge new facilities which have been added to the resources of\r\nthe Tennessee Valley, conducts its activities in collaboration with\r\nlocal and state agencies. That not only avoids the expense of\r\nduplication, but it achieves the collaboration, the participation, the\r\nactive interest of the people in getting a full job done.\r\n\r\nThat is true in the field of forestry. Forestry has a particular role in\r\nthe Tennessee Valley. First of all, the TVA is concerned with the\r\neffective use and control of water, not only in the river channel\r\nitself, but on the land. Forestry, together with engineering and\r\nagriculture, must come together, not only come together within the\r\nadministrative framework of TVA, but within the framework of what our\r\ncolleges and state departments are doing and with what the land owners\r\nare doing in these watersheds.\r\n\r\nFurther than that, the TVA is fully aware that watershed protection\r\ncannot be achieved except within the economy of the region. That means\r\nthat the best use of forest lands from the economic point of view, from\r\nthe productive point of view, as well as from the conservation point of\r\nview, must be taken into account.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the TVA is concerned not only with multiple-purpose\r\ndams, but with multiple-purpose land use. These activities are not\r\nconducted directly by TVA, but in cooperation with the land grant\r\ncolleges and with the appropriate state departments.\r\n\r\nI think and I hope that as you review the several activities which are\r\ngoing on in the Tennessee Valley area that you will keep these\r\ncharacteristics of TVA in mind. We are very happy to have you here. I\r\nhope that many of you will be able to extend your visit or to come back\r\nand see us another time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident John Davidson: I am personally very glad to have heard this\r\ntalk. I know quite a bit more about the fundamental principles of the\r\nwork underlying TVA than I did before.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels, will you say a word on behalf of the Association?\r\n\r\n\r\n+Response+\r\n\r\nDr. L. H. MacDaniels: Mr. President and members of the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association, I am sure that I voice the sentiment of all of the\r\nAssociation to you, Mr. Gant, and all of the Tennessee Valley Authority\r\nour very great appreciation of your allowing us to come and meet with\r\nyou and use the very fine facilities which are available here in Upper\r\nNorris Park.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, and probably I am in the same situation as\r\nmost of you in the North; we have heard a lot about the Tennessee Valley\r\nAuthority, but mostly it is bandied around in the newspapers and usually\r\nconnected with some sort of a political argument of one kind or another.\r\nAnd I think that to come here and to see the place and to live in the\r\ncabins and drive through the forests, to swim in the lake, as some of us\r\ndid yesterday afternoon, went far away around the bend, and went in\r\nswimming--I think you might improve the mud bottom in some places, which\r\nis not too good, but it reminds us of our youth, at least--and to fish\r\nin the lakes, although not too successfully. After we have done that we\r\ncertainly know much more about what sort of a development the Tennessee\r\nValley Authority is.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, as a member of the Northern Nut Growers Association and\r\nas you are members, I think we all appreciate what the Tennessee Valley\r\nAuthority has done for the Northern Nut Growers Association. The\r\nTennessee Valley Authority has been the first, you might say, large\r\nagency which has taken northern nut growing seriously and has used the\r\nknowledge which has been developed by this Association in an extensive\r\nway in the planting and developing of new varieties, developing of new\r\ntechniques in the use of the plants, the nut trees and the persimmons,\r\nand what not, with which the Northern Nut Growers Association has been\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAs we drive up the valley here and we see these thousands of walnut\r\nseedlings which are still to be used and see the plantings which you\r\nwill see more intimately later, we can realize just how extensively the\r\nTennessee Valley Authority has been concerned with the development of\r\nour forest resources and particularly these plants which are of economic\r\nvalue, inasmuch as they are nut trees, and their relationship to\r\nwildlife and a project of this kind in which forest resources and tree\r\nresources are to be made use of.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that you did mention fishing as one of the things that\r\nhas been developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. I also am reminded\r\nof the fact that some of us, including our president, tried to go out\r\nand exercise some of these fish, without much success, and I have been\r\ntrying to think of the reason. I know, as far as we are concerned, we\r\nused all the plugs and spinners and floating baits and sinking baits,\r\nand I went completely through my tackle box and pulled out the one that\r\nwe call the \"Christmas tree,\" a big bunch of spoons with a place to put\r\na minnow on the end, and we dragged that around, almost swamped the\r\nmotor, but did get around; didn't catch anything.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of an incident there at Cornell. We have a director, who\r\nwas head of the Pomology Department at that time. He had a dog that\r\nwasn't disciplined very well, he wouldn't come when he was called, and\r\nso on. The foreman out at the orchard had a dog that was very well\r\ndisciplined. He'd say, \"Go get my hat,\" and he'd get the hat, and \"Go\r\nquickly,\" and he'd go quickly. And this head of the department asked the\r\nforeman, \"Well, how was it that you trained this dog, and how do you\r\ntrain a dog, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"first of all, you have got to know more than the dog.\"\r\nPerhaps that's the case with some of us and the fish. Anyway, we didn't\r\ncatch any fish.\r\n\r\nI don't care to say any more, except, Mr. Gant, to express our\r\nappreciation to you for the excellent facilities which you have\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Dr. MacDaniels.\r\n\r\nI believe the next order is the little talk by myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident's Address\r\n\r\nJOHN DAVIDSON, Xenia, Ohio\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was notified that this Association, in session at Guelph, had\r\nnamed me as its president, I was surprised and deeply honored. I suppose\r\nthere is not a single member of this body who does not have the feeling\r\nthat the Northern Nut Growers Association is \"different,\" unique, and,\r\nvery special: Here are all kinds: scientists and rule-of-thumb planters,\r\nexperienced professionals and inexperienced amateurs, conservationists\r\nand hobbyists, all bent on one objective--to enlighten Americans and\r\nthemselves on the values and opportunities that lie in the study and\r\npractice of planting forest trees which bear crops--specifically, nuts.\r\n\r\nBut the interest of most of our members is rather broader than our name\r\nwould indicate. Forest _crops_, not merely nuts, are the logical\r\noutgrowth in interest that such an organization as ours stimulates. Dr.\r\nZimmerman's work with papaws is a case in point. Mr. Wilkinson's work\r\nwith the Lamb curly walnut is another. The persimmon, the papaw, the\r\nmulberry, the haws, the juneberries--you are likely to find them all,\r\nsooner or later, among the nut trees of our members. You will hear\r\npresently about a wood from one of our nut trees that is so valuable,\r\n_and so possible to grow_, that we may presently be planting for\r\nextraordinarily beautiful and valuable _timber_.\r\n\r\nPatience is what it takes, and faith. Trees are an example to us. If we\r\ncould only look at the procession of the centuries with the eyes of the\r\nsequoias, we should see creation moving on marvelously with magnificent\r\nfruitfulness, and we should take courage.\r\n\r\nHas the process of evolution been more successful with plants than with\r\nthe human race? Should benevolent creation _fail at its highest point_?\r\nCertainly it should not. Nevertheless it certainly will fail there so\r\nlong as so large a body of the race is undernourished, ill-born,\r\nhopelessly submerged--dragging downward rather than lifting upward.\r\n\r\nWho knows the total answer? Education, of course, is a part of it--in\r\nindustry, in eugenics, in moral responsibility. But you can't preach\r\neducation effectively to a starving or half-starved man or child. The\r\nmultiplication of population, the better distribution of goods\r\nthroughout the world (which means in the end the avoidance of extremes\r\nof over and under-production)--these are the world's next greatest\r\nproblems. I personally have the feeling that we are on the verge of an\r\nalmost unthinkable increase in food productiveness through chemurgy's\r\nbetter and more complete use of plant life. We shall yet learn to gauge\r\npopulation to food supplies and food to population. Both are essential.\r\n\r\nWe need more plant breeders and more organic chemists at work on food\r\nsupply all over the world. We need more people of good will and long\r\nvision, fewer political and social parasites; more producers.\r\n\r\nSingularly, at the very moment of writing these words, a letter from a\r\nwell known plant breeder is dropped upon my desk. In it he turns down\r\nthe idea of an hypothetical executive position which most people would\r\nregard as promotion. The importance and interest of his work is so great\r\n_in its own right_ that he would not think of changing.\r\n\r\nThat is what I mean. We need more of his kind in the world. It is hoped\r\nthat in this Association such men may find the kindredship and\r\ncomradeship they so richly earn.\r\n\r\nThis was the spirit with which our Association was organized by Dr.\r\nRobert Morris, Dr. Deming, and a few far-sighted men in the early days\r\nof this century and carried on by them, by Mr. Reed, Dr. Zimmerman,\r\nProfessor Neilson and their kind since. We salute them all. Their works\r\nfollow and honor them by their multiplied fruits.\r\n\r\nI shall not take the time in this full program to review the events of\r\nthe past year. Some of our speakers will do this far better than I. But\r\nI wish to greet our visitors and the new members who may not have been\r\nwith us before. We hope you will feel very much at home in our family of\r\nkindred minds.\r\n\r\nAlso, these remarks would not be complete without recognition of the\r\nefforts of those who unselfishly and unstintingly have given of their\r\ntime and strength to this important work: our Secretary, Joe McDaniel!\r\nYou all know him by his exceptional service to us all. (Let's rise and\r\ngive him a hand.) And while we are on our feet--one of the best\r\ntreasurers any organization ever had, efficient, kindly, but a veritable\r\nwatch-dog of the Treasury, Mr. Snyder! Also a hand to the members of our\r\nimportant committees, Mr. Chase, Dr. MacDaniels, Mr. Slate, Mr. Stoke--I\r\ncan't name or praise them all as they deserve. The NNGA could not\r\npossibly be what it is without them.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us get on to the business before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary's Report\r\n\r\nJ. C. McDANIEL, Nashville, Tennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nThe membership of the Association seems to be increasing fairly\r\nsteadily. When I checked the mailing list early last October, it had 667\r\nnames, as compared with 691 listed in the 37th Annual Report. When I\r\nleft Nashville last week, the number had increased to 742, according to\r\nmy stenographer's latest count. There have been some discontinued\r\nmemberships, as will happen almost every year in any organization, but\r\nthe new members have more than compensated for them, in numbers.\r\n\r\nWe did not add up a total on all the mail sent out in response to\r\ninquiries, but it has been voluminous. Close to 800 requests for our nut\r\nnursery list have been received solely as a result of Mr. Stoke's\r\n_Southern Agriculturist_ chestnut article in last February's issue, and\r\nthey are still trickling in. Some new memberships have resulted from\r\nthese contacts, but more have come as a result of our column in the\r\n_American Fruit Grower_, and a Chinese chestnut article in _The Flower\r\nGrower_ early last spring, which gave our Association a boost.\r\n\r\nSome members have said they did not find their _American Fruit Grower_\r\nsubscriptions of much value to them, particularly since the inauguration\r\nof _The Nutshell_, our news bulletin which has been issued four times\r\nsince the last annual meeting. I will take some of the blame for this,\r\nsince as editor of _The Nutshell_, I am somewhat in the position of\r\ncompeting with myself as columnist for the _Fruit Grower_. Space is\r\nlimited in the latter publication, too, and sometimes publication of the\r\n\"Nut Growers News\" column is deferred a month or two, and again, I have\r\nbeen known to miss a deadline. Most of the columns, as in the previous\r\nyears, are digests of material previously given in our Annual Reports.\r\nThis practice seems to be justified as a matter of keeping nut news\r\nbefore the orcharding public and as a means of attracting some new\r\nmemberships for the Association. I do not know of a better conditioned\r\nlist of prospects than the more than 150,000 _American Fruit Grower_\r\nsubscribers all over the continent, who are at least interested in some\r\nkind of fruiting trees or plants. In that many, by the law of averages,\r\nare many with some interest in nuts. Several hundred will write to the\r\nsecretary or other N.N.G.A. members who are mentioned during the year,\r\nand at least a few score normally will join us.\r\n\r\nThis does not minimize the desirability of having other publicity\r\noutlets. More of you who have a knack at writing should try your own\r\ncontributions to national, regional or even community-wide publications.\r\nEven short letters to the editor, in such cases, may be read by \"kindred\r\nspirits,\" and you will be read by men and women whose interest in nut\r\ntrees (even though it may have been a dormant interest) will be\r\nstimulated to the extent of becoming N.N.G.A. members. Then it is up to\r\nour officers, the program committee members, and our contributors to\r\nkeep them interested enough to renew their memberships another year!\r\n\r\nYour comments on _The Nutshell_ have been quite flattering to its\r\neditor. You _all_ can help make it a better publication by contributing\r\nshort original observations or clippings of good items on hardy nut\r\ntrees from other sources.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuing shortage apparent in the supply of good named\r\nvarieties of hardy nut trees in nearly all areas. This seems\r\nparticularly the case with Chinese chestnuts. Few propagators at present\r\nhave them in even enough quantity to catalogue, and the demand which has\r\nbeen built up by the good publicity on chestnuts exhausts most\r\nnurseries' supplies each spring before all orders can be filled. Our\r\nnursery list in the Winter issue of _The Nutshell_ has gone to some\r\n2,000 people and has helped the nurserymen to sell out their trees\r\nquickly. We hope this will lead to a sound expansion in the commercial\r\npropagation of _good_ nut trees.\r\n\r\nI should again call attention to our affiliation with the American\r\nHorticultural Society. This enables our members in good standing to\r\nreceive their good quarterly publication, _The National Horticultural\r\nMagazine_, for only $3.50 a year. You may obtain your affiliate\r\nmembership through our Treasurer, or directly from the American\r\nHorticultural Society, Room 821, Washington Loan and Trust Building,\r\nWashington 4, D. C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: You have heard the Secretary's report. Has anyone\r\nany revisions or modifications of this report to suggest?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I move acceptance with thanks.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded, a vote taken, and the motion carried\r\nunanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: If the Secretary will also read the Treasurer's\r\nreport, we will proceed with it.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Mr. Snyder wrote recently, regretting that he would miss\r\nthis meeting (for reasons of health). He says he can not accept the\r\nposition of Treasurer another year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasurer's Report for Year September 1, 1947 to September 1, 1948\r\n\r\nD. C.

Any remarks?\r\nIt is a very good report. It shows that the organization is creeping up\r\nfinancially and in very good condition due to the continuous care that\r\nthe Secretary and the Treasurer both have used in keeping up with our\r\nmembership, keeping dues paid up, and so on. I will entertain a motion\r\nto accept our Treasurer's Report.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I so move.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded.)\r\n\r\nMr. O'Rourke: It should be accepted for audit.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I will accept the amendment.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: It is moved now, then, that the report be accepted\r\nfor audit. Are there any remarks?\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The next order of business is the regular business\r\nmeeting of the Association. I think perhaps the first thing we should do\r\nmight be to proceed with the election of a Nominating Committee and the\r\nAuditing Committee. I believe both, if I am not misinformed, are\r\nelective and not appointive. The chair will entertain nominations for\r\nthe Nominating Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nominating Committee Elected+\r\n\r\n(The following were nominated for the Nominating Committee: Dr. H. L.\r\nCrane, Harry R. Weber, Dr. Wm. L. Rohrbacher, J. F. Wilkinson, George L.\r\nSlate. Upon motion that the Secretary cast a unanimous ballot for those\r\nnominated, vote was taken and motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Am I correct in saying that the Auditing Committee\r\nis elective, rather than appointive by the Executive Committee?\r\n\r\nMr. Silvis: I understood it was three members and just appointed.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Yes, under Article I of the by-laws, it is appointed.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: In that case we will do nothing about that now.\r\n\r\nI think perhaps we might proceed with a few resolutions or motions\r\nbefore going to the further order of business. The chair will entertain\r\na motion that the Association give its thanks to Mrs. Baker and her\r\ncommittee of the ladies for their entertainment of last evening and for\r\nfuture entertainment.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: I so move, Mr. President.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded, a vote called for, and the motion carried\r\nunanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Also the chair will entertain a motion that the\r\nSecretary be instructed to send Dr. Deming our usual affectionate\r\ngreetings and assure him that his beloved association is still carrying\r\non in the spirit of the founders.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: By the way, I have a letter from Dr. Deming. Should I read\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That would be fine if you would, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n+A Letter from Dr. Deming+\r\n\r\n_(Secretary's note: We substitute a more recent letter, dated May 9,\r\n1949)._\r\n\r\n\"... You are giving me much consolation for all _my_ broken promises to\r\nget out the annual report at an early date. I suggest that you have a\r\nlawyer draw up a contract for the printer to get out the report at a\r\ngiven date or forfeit so much per day for all delay. If you don't do\r\nthat the printer will put you off for something that will give him a\r\nlittle more profit. I don't know that we ever got out a report in plenty\r\nof time for the members to get their orders in early or get other\r\nbenefits from the report if it arrived before planting time.\r\n\r\n\"I note in the announcement of our Connecticut state medical society\r\nthat it scheduled a recess of 15 minutes or so at intervals for members\r\nto 'view the exhibits.' It looks to me like a good idea....\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations on the fast work of Joe, Jr. The idea is to get plenty\r\nof limbs before letting him bear. Have you tried the sweet buckeye on\r\nhim? [See page 181.]\r\n\r\n\"We have Spring here, too, as well as you in Nashville, and it is good.\r\n\r\n\"I get awfully tired after very little exertion. I'll be 87 on September\r\n1. Too old to undertake any obligations.\r\n\r\n\"Best luck.\r\n\r\n   \"Yours,\r\n\r\n   s/W. C. DEMING\"\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That is expressed beautifully, as usual. May I have\r\nthat motion?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: It has been moved and seconded that the Secretary be\r\ninstructed to send Dr. Deming our affectionate greetings and assure him\r\nthat his beloved association is still carrying on in the spirit of the\r\nfounders.\r\n\r\n(A vote on the motion was taken, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Another, that the Association accept with deep\r\nregrets the resignation of D. C. Snyder, and that the Secretary be\r\ninstructed to send him our affectionate greetings and thanks for his\r\nlong, efficient and outstanding services as Treasurer of this body. Are\r\nyou in favor of such a motion?\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Take out the accepting the resignation part, and the rest\r\nwill be O.K.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That is right. As amended then, with the omission of\r\nthat \"accepting the resignation.\"\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+Clarence A. Reed Elected Honorary Member+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: One more. The chair will entertain a motion that the\r\nSecretary be instructed to send C. A. Reed our greetings and as a small\r\nmeasure of the esteem we have for him and in recognition of his long and\r\nextraordinary services to this Association, we elect him a life member\r\nthere-of.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think it should be an \"honorary member\" rather than a\r\n\"life member.\" A life member contributes $75.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I believe that is correct, an honorary member. With\r\nthat amendment, then.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I would so move, Mr. President.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Second the motion.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Mr. President, I would like at this time, if I may, to say a\r\nfew remarks in regard to Mr. Reed. I saw him last Friday afternoon, and\r\nhe asked me to convey to the Association his very deep regrets that he\r\nwas unable to attend. He had planned to attend, but his doctor said\r\nabsolutely no. So he has learned from experience that he has got to pay\r\nmore attention to his doctor's orders than he has in the past.\r\n\r\nHe wanted me to tell the members of the Association that although he\r\nwasn't here in body he was in spirit and in mind.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That's fine. I think perhaps we should proceed first\r\nwith the reports of committees.\r\n\r\nThe Finance Committee. Mr. Weshcke is not here. Mr. Weber is next in\r\norder on that committee. I presume there would be nothing special to\r\nreport at this time.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Nothing.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Press and Publication. Mr. Stoke is chairman of that\r\ncommittee. Mr. Stoke is not present at this time. Dr. MacDaniels, would\r\nyou have anything to say in the matter of Press and Publications\r\nCommittee? Have you any recommendations or reports to make?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Mr. Chairman, I hadn't planned to make any report. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I had very little to do with the work of the\r\nPublications Committee this year. I have been rather happy that it has\r\nbeen handled otherwise, and I think our thanks are due to our Secretary,\r\nwho has carried the brunt, in fact, almost the entire burden of the\r\npublication of the proceedings. Also of _The Nutshell_. That occurred\r\nthrough a series of circumstances which I don't wish to outline here. I\r\nthink probably the chief determining factor was that the contract for\r\nprinting was awarded to a firm in Nashville, which almost automatically\r\nmade it at least convenient and expedient to have the matter handled in\r\nNashville. I believe you will concur in that general opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. MacDaniel: Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: So that our Secretary has had an unusually heavy burden\r\nwhich we should not expect him to carry again.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Dr. MacDaniels.\r\n\r\nThe chair will entertain a motion to accept Dr. MacDaniels' report on\r\nbehalf of the Press and Publication Committee.\r\n\r\n(It was so moved and seconded, a vote taken and motion carried\r\nunanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: On Varieties and Contests. Mr. Zarger is not going\r\nto be with us, I am afraid, and if there is any other member of that\r\ncommittee present who has something to say on the matter of variety and\r\ncontests, we would be very glad to hear from him. I don't hear anything,\r\nso we will proceed to the next one.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Survey Committee. Mr. Silvis is chairman of that\r\ncommittee, and I will say on his behalf that he was raring to go and\r\nwould have gone if it had been the feeling on the part of some of the\r\nother members that a survey was timely at that time. It happened that\r\nthat was not the feeling, it was not a good year to make a survey, and\r\non that account I wrote to Mr. Silvis that possibly it would be well to\r\nput off any important survey for the year 1947.\r\n\r\nDo you have anything to say, Mr. Silvis, in addition to this?\r\n\r\nMr. Silvis: Well, on the cuff, no, and off the cuff I would like to make\r\nthis remark, that I just had one question I was going to require every\r\nmember to answer to me for, and that was what kind of a nut tree should\r\nI plant, and thereby try to establish a zone between frost-free dates\r\nfor various locations or states or territories. It didn't develop.\r\n\r\nI received as late as last week John Bregger's note explaining why it\r\nwas his reply came late. But I do want to make this remark, and for our\r\nable Secretary's first issue of _The Nutshell_ I know this to be a fact,\r\nthat with it, it's the nuts, and without it, it's hell.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: What shall we do with Mr. Silvis's report? We have\r\nsome action to take presently on the matter of survey in addition to\r\nthis report. Could I have a motion to accept the report of the Survey\r\nCommittee?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: So move.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Second.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Mr. Chase disappeared again. He is chairman of the\r\nProgram Committee. We all have evidence of what he has been doing.\r\nPerhaps his program is sufficient to report.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. H. Graham is chairman of the Membership Committee. I think Mrs.\r\nGraham is not here, so perhaps we can pass on.\r\n\r\nReport of the Necrology Committee fortunately is blank.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: There is one that I know of. Mr. Schuster of Oregon passed\r\naway last winter.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I think that points out a little weakness in our\r\norganization. The death of Mr. Schuster should have been reported and\r\nsome notice of it taken, perhaps.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke, you are here as chairman of the Exhibits Committee. Would you\r\nlike to say something?\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: I don't know that I have anything to say. The exhibits speak\r\nfor themselves back there. I wish to thank those who made contributions\r\nto that exhibit, and some still came in this morning that you haven't\r\nseen. I think it's been fine cooperation.\r\n\r\nI feel an apology is due for not getting out more publicity on behalf of\r\nthe committee. I had hoped that another copy of _The Nutshell_ would be\r\nout before this meeting so I could make another call for exhibits, but\r\nit wasn't, and I didn't get my material in to our Secretary in time for\r\nthe earlier one.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: I believe we did have a notice in the summer issue.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Yes, there was a notice. At any rate, we have had exhibits\r\nhere all the way from Georgia to New York. I am not sure whether they\r\nhave any from Canada or not. I think it makes a very nice display, and I\r\ncertainly appreciate your cooperation.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: In connection with these exhibits, we were driving along\r\ntalking to Mr. Slate about the desirability of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation sending an exhibit to the Harvest Show of the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society. That was done about ten years ago, and the\r\nSociety gave us a silver medal at that time. I know from talking with\r\nMr. Nehrling that they would be pleased to have such an exhibit put on,\r\nand I think that if we could take much of the material from our exhibits\r\nhere and send it there that that would make an acceptable exhibit, and\r\nwe almost assuredly would get not only considerable publicity out of\r\nthat, because it would be an exhibit of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation, but we might also get either a cash award or a medal. I\r\nthink if we work behind the scenes, if we preferred the cash we could\r\nget that, which would be of some value to the Association.\r\n\r\nNow, I speak of this merely to bring it to your attention and to point\r\nout that any of the personally furnished exhibits that you wish to turn\r\nover for that purpose, you may arrange with Mr. Stoke for that.\r\n\r\n(Further discussion on the details of sending in the above-mentioned\r\nexhibits.)\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I would move this Association favored sending an exhibit\r\nto the Massachusetts Horticultural Society Harvest show, provided\r\nmaterial is available.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Second the motion.\r\n\r\nDr. Silvis: May I make this remark and also be in the form of a motion,\r\nthat those exhibitors report immediately at the adjournment of this\r\nsession to Mr. Stoke and make known to him whether yes or no, whether\r\ntheir exhibits can be sent up.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Do you make that motion in the form of an amendment?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I will include that in the motion.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I accept it.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion as amended, and it was carried\r\nunanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Place of Meeting Committee. I judge that that\r\ncommittee is not ready to report, is it, Mr. Slate, for this following\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: The chairman didn't realize until just before we were ready\r\nto leave that he was a member of that committee. I have given the matter\r\nsome thought on the way down, and in the previous years I have usually\r\ngone fishing for invitations some time before the meeting. I did drop a\r\nline overboard a few days ago, but I didn't catch anything more than I\r\ncaught in this big lake up here.\r\n\r\nNow, from previous experience I don't believe we can consider going to\r\nthe Middle West. Mr. Snyder, Mr. Becker in Michigan, and Dr. Colby at\r\nIllinois, have not thought that they had enough material to make it\r\nworth while to go out there. That throws it back to the East, and we\r\nhave been to some of the better places in recent years; Ronoake,\r\nVirginia, Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Boston.\r\n\r\nI think there are two places that we should consider. I think we should\r\nconsider Beltsville and the New York City region. We all know that there\r\nis plenty of material at Beltsville. We have not been there for some\r\ntime. And in the New York City region we have the plantings of Gilbert\r\nSmith, who is probably 85 or 90 miles above New York. He is not far from\r\nPoughkeepsie where I am sure there are ample facilities for handling the\r\ncrowd. Then there may be possibly some of Dr. Graves' plantings that\r\nwould be worth seeing on a field trip.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the committee will be very glad to receive invitations\r\nfrom anyone here and consider them, and we will make the final report at\r\nthe final business session at the time of the banquet, I believe. But\r\nbetween now and then I want you to consider the matter rather seriously\r\nand let me know what you are thinking about.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I think it would be desirable, if it were possible,\r\nfor Mr. Slate to wire the proper authorities at Beltsville or\r\nPoughkeepsie.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Mr. President, one of our members is Mr. Bernath, who has\r\nbeen quite faithful in attending nearly all our meetings, and he has, I\r\nimagine, much of interest to show to the members, and he is located near\r\nPoughkeepsie. I am just throwing that out for the members to think over\r\nas to what they would think about Poughkeepsie as a possible meeting\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That's worth listening to.\r\n\r\nWould it be advisable, do you think, for Mr. Slate at the expense of the\r\nAssociation to wire to Poughkeepsie or to Beltsville to see whether an\r\ninvitation is available or not?\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: Those places are well represented now.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: I imagine Mr. Bernath can speak for himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernath: I don't know, I think if we could delay it another year,\r\nMr. Smith is going to retire from the State School, and he will have\r\nplenty of time. I am very busy, and he will have loads of time on his\r\nhands, and then he can give it his attention. I think that would be all\r\nright next year.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: That's up to the Association to decide.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernath: We would like to have you come at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: Beltsville is very well represented in Dr. Crane.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Mr, Chairman, in view of what Mr. Bernath says, I'd accept\r\nMr. Bernath's suggestion and have Poughkeepsie on the list for the year\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernath: That's right.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Dr. Crane may have something.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Mr. President and members of the Association, we'd like to\r\nhave the Association meeting at Beltsville again. However, we have had\r\nfour years of May freezes in Beltsville Station, and I am going to tell\r\nyou all is not in any too good condition. A lot of it has been pulled,\r\nand we have had to replant an awful lot of the stuff that is now just\r\nplanted this year. We lost a lot of the plantings that were made last\r\nyear because of injury. As you folks probably know that have been there\r\nbefore, we labored under very great difficulties on soil conditions in\r\nthat we have mostly sands and gravel.\r\n\r\nSo we are kind of in a mess there right now. We'd be glad to have the\r\nAssociation meet at Beltsville, and we have right good facilities there\r\nfor meetings, but as far as any plantings in the area, a lot of the work\r\nwe are doing, we are kind of going through a period of change right now\r\nand getting re-established, and I want you to know the situation.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Well, we have been forewarned. It's a case, I judge,\r\nof not being unwilling to see us, but you are not so anxious, for us to\r\nsee you, is that it?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I wouldn't want you to come there under false hopes that you\r\nwould see a lot.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I would like to say we have done quite a lot of work in\r\nbreeding chestnuts and also work with forest types, crossing American\r\nchestnuts and Chinese. But I agree quite with Dr. Crane, that we haven't\r\nso much to show you there. Of course, it's a dog-gone good thing to get\r\nfamiliar with these diseases and see what you are up against, because\r\nall through the history of nut culture, and so forth, one of the basic\r\ndefects has been the failure to appreciate the importance of insect and\r\ndisease factors. And we are very much in need of more basic research\r\nalong those lines, but I agree with Dr. Crane that at present we have a\r\nlimited amount to show you there.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is the Plant Industry Station there with a lot of\r\nexperimental work, greenhouse work and all sorts of basic research work,\r\nfertilization work, and so forth, going on there. A lot of people like\r\nto come to Washington. Our plantings are pretty much the same condition\r\nas Dr. Crane's and not a display proposition such as you have here at\r\nTVA.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Suppose we regard this report, then, as temporary\r\nand hear more from you later.\r\n\r\nI think that concludes the reports.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors, unless there is some other order of business to\r\nbe taken up, have some recommendations to make to the Association. One\r\nis the recommendation that the Association place the annual membership\r\nfee at $3, the supporting membership fee at $10 and the life membership\r\nfee at $75. They didn't wish to take the responsibility of doing\r\nanything more than referring that matter to this Association.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: That could be handled in the by-laws under the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: We still also have another rather important matter\r\nthat's been referred to the Association, and that is the matter of a\r\nsufficient amount of remuneration to permit our Secretary to hire a\r\nstenographer to do the extra amount of work that is gradually\r\naccumulating in that office. The resolution that is referred to you\r\ncalls for a payment of 50 cents per member to the Secretary for this\r\npurpose.... We have no right to be set up so that the work of the\r\nAssociation would encroach upon a person's job as it is set up at the\r\npresent time. That recommendation was that it was contingent, of course,\r\nupon raising the dues to $3.00 and take 50 cents of that to offset the\r\nstenographic help and try to re-organize our affairs between the\r\nSecretary and Treasurer so that as much as possible of the routine\r\nmailing, and routine stenographic work would be carried in this way.\r\n\r\n(Discussion on the above recommendation.)\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: I move that the additional remuneration be granted, 50 cents\r\nper member, to the Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: I will second the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher: I'd like to make an amendment to that, that the dues be\r\nraised to $3.00 in order to make this possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: I will accept the amendment.\r\n\r\nMr Smith: And I will second the motion contingent, of course, to the\r\nraising of the dues.\r\n\r\n(Vote taken, motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: We will appoint a Resolutions Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Resolutions Committee+\r\n\r\nSterling Smith, H. L. Crane, Raymond E. Silvis, H. F. Stoke.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I think so far as I know that's everything except\r\nthe report of the Committee on the Constitution. Unless I hear otherwise\r\nwe will proceed with that report.\r\n\r\n(Discussion on Constitution.)\r\n\r\n(Constitution and by-laws approved as set out in another part of this\r\nreport, the Constitution having first been read at 1947 meeting)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: As I understand it, then, this constitution, unless\r\nwe make some other provision, is in effect as of now.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Now with these by-laws in effect there will have to be a\r\nfresh nominating committee elected for the next year.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: Mr. President, I make a motion, if it's in order, that the\r\nNominating Committee as elected previously for this meeting also\r\ncontinue and serve for next year.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke: Second the motion.\r\n\r\n(Vote taken, motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: There is one other matter that was brought up at the\r\ndirectors' meeting, and inasmuch as the directors did not have a quorum,\r\nit should be voted through here, I think, and that is that a motion is\r\nin order to pay Mrs. Gibbs $25 for her services as stenographer at our\r\nmeeting. That was done, I believe, at Guelph, and it involves a lot of\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\nMr. Korn: I second the motion.\r\n\r\n(Vote taken, motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Shall we adjourn, with a continuance of the business\r\nmeeting at the banquet?\r\n\r\n(Recess taken until 1:00 o'clock p. m.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+Monday Afternoon Session+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Shall we come to order?\r\n\r\nWe now come to the interesting part of our program, and we will listen\r\nfirst to Mr. Quick of West Virginia, who will take the place of Mr.\r\nSayers, the State Forester at Charleston, West Virginia. Mr. Quick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Development and Propagation of Blight Resistant Chestnut in West\r\nVirginia\r\n\r\nRALPH H. QUICK, Conservation Commission, Charleston, West Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Quick: Ladies and gentlemen of the Association, your guests and\r\nfriends: In substituting for the State Forester of West Virginia I\r\nrealize that I am undertaking a big job. A few of you know Mr. Wilson\r\nSayers, who is the State Forester, and those of you who do may assure\r\nthe rest of the group what a big job I am undertaking, because I feel\r\nthat I am in pretty good-sized shoes.\r\n\r\nThe subject that has been assigned is The Development and Propagation of\r\nBlight Resistant Chestnut in West Virginia. Now, being a forester, I am\r\nperhaps interested in blight resistant chestnut from a little different\r\nstandpoint than the majority of this group. As representing the\r\nConservation Commission of that state I might say that we are interested\r\nprimarily from the game-food viewpoint. Now, that's a little bit\r\ndifferent, I expect, than most of you have been thinking about, or some\r\nof you, at least. But that is the standpoint from which we are\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to go along with you this afternoon and discuss some of\r\nthe things that we have done and some of the things that we are\r\nlearning--there are a few yet--that lead us along that line to believe\r\nthat we can do something with blight-resistant chestnuts in West\r\nVirginia as a game food. We are just at the beginning, so to speak--that\r\nis, the Conservation Commission of that state is just at the beginning\r\nof our study. We have been fooling with it a little off and on since\r\nback in the middle '30's, but interest has lagged and then has picked up\r\nagain two or three times.\r\n\r\nI am sure that as far as the production of good strains of\r\nblight-resistant chestnut, better strains of Chinese, and so on, that\r\nthere are people in West Virginia who are more capable of telling you\r\nwhat has been done from a private viewpoint than anyone with the\r\nConservation Commission, but we are interested in learning about it and\r\nproducing it in large numbers for a game food, and, of course, if we are\r\ninterested in distributing from our nursery over the state for that\r\npurpose, we are interested in producing better strains of\r\nblight-resisting chestnut as we go.\r\n\r\nAlong back in the 1920's a few plantations, or a few trees were planted\r\nin the state by what was then the old Fish and Game Commission, and the\r\nrecords have been lost, as has been true in many other states. But then,\r\napparently, the beginning was made. In going over some of those early\r\nplantings I will only have time to hit the high spots and the ones in\r\nwhich we are particularly interested in our line, but the first ones\r\nwere back there somewhere in the '20's.\r\n\r\nOne of the best plantations, the one that we are particularly interested\r\nin at the present time, is in Jackson County, West Virginia, and it is\r\nof the University of Nanking strain, and there were 34 trees planted\r\nthere back in 1926, and we are told that they were planted from 2-0[1]\r\nstock, from nuts that came from China in 1924. Twenty-six of those trees\r\nsurvived, and we think they are pretty good nuts. You may be interested\r\nto know that that plantation now averages 22 feet in height and has an\r\naverage diameter at breast height of 8 inches. The spacing in that\r\nplantation was 26 by 26 feet.\r\n\r\nNow, we can't take credit, nor do we want to take credit, for that\r\nplantation. The state agency had nothing to do with it. It was put in\r\nthere through the cooperation of the gentlemen from Beltsville, but we\r\nare very much interested in that plantation; so interested that we have\r\ngone to the owner, along with the permission of the fellows from\r\nBeltsville, and sewed the thing up for a five year period, during which\r\ntime we hope to get the seed and to improve our own strains and\r\nestablish blocks of our own on state-owned land under different\r\nconditions and on different sites where we expect in the future to be\r\nable to secure seed for our use and production at the nursery.\r\n\r\nIn the first few years that this plantation that we are speaking of in\r\nJackson County produced, not many people paid much attention to it or\r\nattached much significance to it. The man who had charge of it gave the\r\nnuts away for experimental purposes or for any reason that anybody\r\nhappened to ask for them, and shipped a lot of them free. But along in\r\nthe early 1940's he began to find out what he had, and he started\r\nselling seed and made a pretty good thing out of it.\r\n\r\nLast year was the first year that we had gotten seed from that\r\nplantation. We got 75 pounds of good nuts taken in the fall of 1947.\r\n\r\nWe have another orchard, another plantation that led us to become\r\ninterested, I guess, in producing blight-resistant chestnut as a game\r\nfood and along forestry lines, and that is the orchard that we have on\r\nnursery property. It was one of the early ones, and I expect one of the\r\nearliest in the state, but it was planted along back in 1936, fifty-one\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWhen we started in this we didn't know anything about it at all, so we\r\nhave built up our small knowledge in the last few years. But it didn't\r\ntake us long to realize that our orchard on our nursery property was of\r\nbadly crossed material, and it had some very undesirable trees. If we\r\nsucceeded in doing anything with them as a game food we would have to\r\neliminate, and only last year did we get around to the place where we\r\ncould secure authority to eliminate the undesirable species. We have\r\nabout half of the stand left now, but we are pretty sure that the trees\r\nthat we do have are of good strain.\r\n\r\nIt might be interesting for you to note--maybe some of you can top\r\nit--we were interested when this orchard was planted, in what would\r\nhappen if the trees were planted and allowed to grow as a forest stand.\r\nSo they were planted in six-by-six spacing. Of course, we got a lot of\r\nself-pruning and a lot of competition, as we would in forests by the\r\ntrees growing up and competing with each other and reaching for height\r\nand light. Some of them died and some were so badly suppressed that they\r\nfailed to make any growth at all. But there is one tree that we still\r\nhave in that orchard that we are proud of, not from the standpoint of\r\nnut production, nor does it produce a very good nut as far as the human\r\ntaste is concerned. But it has made a single stick that far surpasses\r\nany other tree we have in the orchard. It looks like a forest tree. In\r\n1945--it might be hard for you to believe--it grew nine feet. That isn't\r\nan exaggeration. It was measured. We thought that was a lot better than\r\nfair growth. Of course, it hasn't made any growth like that since, and I\r\ndon't think it ever did before, but it just had the push to go and went\r\nnine feet in one growing season.\r\n\r\nLeaving that orchard for a few minutes, there were 38 plantings of from\r\n10 to 50 trees each made by the Soil Conservation Service and the\r\nDivision of Forest Pathology of the Bureau of Plant Industry in the\r\nspring of 1939. These were examined by Dr. Diller of that Bureau in the\r\nspring of 1940 and in 1947. He has told us that he graded those\r\nplantings as he found them, 10 being good, and he said the next 15 were\r\nonly fair and he put 13 down as total failures.\r\n\r\nOf those 13 that failed--from the forestry standpoint now, remember--he\r\nsaid that 7 of the failures were due to poor site selection, three were\r\nsuppressed by surrounding hardwoods and other competing growth, and\r\nthree had been destroyed by cattle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Meaning, two years old, not transplanted in the\r\nnursery.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+A Commercial Chestnut Nurseryman+\r\n\r\nI don't know whether any of you know of--I expect you do--the Gold\r\nChestnut Nursery in West Virginia near Cowen, and it is owned and\r\noperated by Mr. Arthur A. Gold. He has been interested in\r\nblight-resistant chestnuts from a commercial standpoint, selling from\r\nhis nursery for a good many years. He has worked with us some in the\r\nConservation Commission and has given us the benefit of his experience.\r\nAnd if any of you have the opportunity I think you would be interested\r\nin seeing Mr. Gold's nursery. He was an old-time nurseryman that handled\r\nmost of the conifers found in a commercial nursery, but in the last few\r\nyears he has gone into chestnut production almost entirely, and if you\r\nhave an opportunity, I am sure Mr. Gold would welcome you to his nursery\r\nin Webster County.\r\n\r\nThe Game Division of the Conservation Commission of West Virginia\r\nestablished three or four small plantings on the state forests in 1938\r\nand 1939, but they had low survival. Dr. Diller in going around with\r\nsome of us and checking on those has found that we were back there where\r\nall of us were trying to find something and trying to learn something\r\nand that we made many mistakes and that we picked poor stock, for one\r\nthing, and poor sites for another thing, but the great disadvantage and\r\nthe biggest limiting factor was our poor selection of sites there in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nIn handling chestnuts that you people handle maybe in small or large\r\nquantities where all of your time can be devoted to that particular\r\nthing, you probably have a lot of things that you do that we don't have\r\ntime to do because at the nursery in West Virginia we are interested\r\nprimarily in producing conifers and other forest trees for the\r\nreforestation of abandoned land. So in handling this Chinese chestnut as\r\na game food we are working on a sideline. We have to pick it up as fast\r\nas we can do the job and do as much as we can and learn about as much as\r\nwe can. And, of course, we learn slower than people who have the time to\r\nspend and perhaps the money to spend at it. But we are limited in those\r\ntwo respects.\r\n\r\nBut seed collections are made, and we find it necessary in collecting\r\nfrom two of the orchards that we are now using for seed to collect twice\r\na day in the season that the nuts are ripening, because both of those\r\norchards which we prize are close to forest lands and squirrel country,\r\nand they really give us a race for it. The fact of the matter is the\r\norchard at the nursery has attracted the squirrels on that particular\r\nside of the mountain. I have hunted on opening day and killed my limit\r\nof squirrels without going outside of the residence and been back at\r\nwork time at eight o'clock. It really attracts them on that side of the\r\nhill. We are going to compete with the squirrels, but as you will see,\r\nwe have just about given up that orchard as a seed source.\r\n\r\nWe find it necessary to treat the seed, of course, before we plant it.\r\nMany of you people, of course, go into the spraying end of it before the\r\nnut ever develops. We haven't the time or the money right now to go into\r\nit that way, so we try to take care of the nut after we collect it and\r\nbring it in.\r\n\r\nI expect it is not necessary for me to go into any of the details on any\r\nof the methods that may be used to get rid of the weevil, because you\r\nare all familiar with that. Maybe it suffices to say that we at the\r\nnursery now are using the hot water treatment. The little weevil is\r\nfound in there and not always apparent. In fact, most of the time it\r\nisn't apparent that the nut is infested, but they are, and if we take\r\nmeasures to kill the weevil we haven't any germination of the weevil. We\r\nused gas once, but we are limited in that at present. It is a lot more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the first few years that we tried to produce chestnuts at\r\nthe nursery, stratified them. We got along pretty well with that in damp\r\nsand, we got along fairly well in sawdust, and we got along especially\r\nwell with damp sphagnum moss. But in the end we determined that we are\r\ngetting better results if we plant the nuts as they are collected. In\r\nother words, the seed was taken from the orchard, treated to kill the\r\nweevil and put in the ground in the fall.\r\n\r\nNow, you can't get away with that everywhere. Our orchard is far enough\r\naway from the nursery that we don't have any rodent damage. We have had\r\nsome trouble from skunks, and they finally find out that the nuts are in\r\nthere in a row where we have planted them, and they go right down and\r\nget them. But we have no trouble from mice or rats. We are far away from\r\nwoodland and buildings.\r\n\r\nWe find that some people have trouble with wind or water erosion. We\r\ndon't have that. So we can get by and do a better job and produce better\r\ntrees by sowing nuts in the fall, and we sow them in the fall, just as\r\nif we were sowing black walnuts for production and distribution over the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBy the next fall when we are ready to distribute those seedlings as 1-0\r\nstock we find that we have produced seedlings of about 14 inches in\r\nheight as 1-0 stock. From what I have seen that isn't a bad size to\r\nproduce as 1-0 stock, though it is better in some places. We find, too,\r\nin the spring before germination, that in our particular section of the\r\nstate along the Ohio River valley we sometimes get a dry spring and find\r\nit necessary to irrigate that land where we planted the chestnuts, just\r\nas the seed beds where we planted pine, in order to keep the ground\r\nmoist and keep it in a condition where seeds will germinate freely.\r\n\r\nWe weed our chestnuts just as we do every row planted in the nursery,\r\ncultivate with the tractor about three times in a season, which is all\r\nthe time we have to give to it, and hand weed it once. Perhaps it ought\r\nto have a little more than that. Some seasons I am sure it should, but\r\nthat's about the time we are allowed or the time that we can allot to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nI hope, Mr. Davidson, you will check me here on this time. I don't want\r\nto get too far out and upset the schedule.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: All right, if necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Quick: In distributing, the seedlings or blight-resistant chestnut\r\nseed in West Virginia we began back in 1943 putting them out in\r\nquantity. We had to limit them, the only thing in the nursery we had to\r\nlimit the amount as to seed. That was because everybody in the state\r\nbecame very much interested, and the Conservation Commission makes those\r\navailable to any land owner in the state free of charge if he will plant\r\nthem as a game food but not under other circumstances. He can't use them\r\nfor ornamentals, and he can't use them for shade purposes in his yard.\r\nBut he can receive a limited number if he is willing to use them for\r\ngame. So in scattering them over the state, so many people wanted so\r\nmany of them that if we didn't watch we'd have all of our chestnuts\r\nplanted in three or four, or half a dozen spots in the state, and we are\r\ninterested in learning as much as we can by having them put out at\r\ndifferent elevations, different sites and under different conditions, so\r\nwe had to limit it to ten to an individual in 1943. We have gradually\r\nupped that as our production has gone up, from 15 to 20, then 40, and\r\nthis year we are offering 50 to any land owner in the State of West\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nNow you can see why we are interested in trying to improve the nut. If\r\nwe are going to distribute them all over the state, let's distribute a\r\ngood nut, a nut that is not only a heavy bearer for the game, but a nut,\r\ntoo, that is fit for human consumption.\r\n\r\nIn our site recommendations we have been trying to follow pretty well\r\nthe ideas of the boys from Beltsville, and we found out that what they\r\nhave been telling us is just about right. In other words, we are setting\r\nour chestnuts in the cove types, moist with gentle slope, preferably on\r\nthe north, and we are getting better growth there. It doesn't mean as\r\nfar as we are concerned that it doesn't grow well on drier land and on\r\nrich hill-tops but the growth is so much greater when it's put in good\r\nground and under those conditions. In other words, it needs a tulip\r\npoplar site; where tulip poplar is growing or has recently grown might\r\nbe one way to select a site for our chestnuts.\r\n\r\nIn these five year now that we have been distributing these chestnuts we\r\nhave distributed something like 200,000. Now, we know that all of those\r\nseedlings haven't been good strains, but they have been the best we\r\ncould do at that time as we were going along. We hope to learn from you\r\npeople, and we hope you can give us help in improving our strains so\r\nthat we can distribute better chestnuts over the state.\r\n\r\nWe haven't had a good system of checking up, until the present time, on\r\nplantings that have been made in the past, but we are initiating a\r\nsystem just now wherein all plantations that have been made from forest\r\nstock will have regular examination all over the state of West Virginia,\r\nand we are including chestnuts in that. We have made some checks in the\r\nstate on certain selected sites and have found out, strange enough, that\r\nthese little plantations that are spotted around on the farms, if they\r\nwere put in correctly and handled properly according to our\r\ninstructions, have given us a survival of about 80 to 85 per cent, which\r\nis, as you will remember, about the percentage in the Nanking strain\r\nplanting in Jackson County, 26 out of the 34 original trees. That seems\r\nstrange, but it has proved true all over the state in the few checks\r\nthat we have made. But we are going into it and checking these\r\nplantations and by so doing I believe we can eliminate a good many of\r\nour own troubles, along with your help.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Quick for a very interesting paper.\r\n\r\nIs Professor Moore, present? Our next talk will be on The Present Status\r\nof the Chestnut in Virginia, by Professor R. C. Moore of the Virginia\r\nPolytechnic Institute of Blacksburg, Virginia. Professor Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Present Status of the Chestnut in Virginia\r\n\r\nR.C. MOORE, Department of Horticulture Virginia Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly reviewing the past, Virginia has been in the same position as\r\nmany other states in regard to the large number of native American\r\nchestnuts that once grew wild before the blight epidemic occurred. Most\r\nof the chestnuts were found on loose, open type soils rather than on\r\nheavy limestone soil. In mountainous parts of the state, considerable\r\nincome was obtained from the sale of wild chestnuts. Men, women, and\r\nchildren gathered these nuts and traded them at the stores for\r\nmerchandise. One small country store, in Floyd County, southwest\r\nVirginia, assembled and shipped between sixty and eighty thousand pounds\r\nannually. A small town, Stuart, in Patrick County, shipped three\r\ncarloads daily during the peak of the season. These nuts found their way\r\nto city markets, where chestnut roasters were as commonly seen as\r\npopcorn poppers. Since many of these native chestnut trees grew in\r\nforests or on wasteland, there was little expense involved except in the\r\ntime required to gather them. The demand was good but frequently the\r\nsale price was rather low, especially during years when the crop was\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nAfter blight destroyed the wild trees, a considerable amount of timber\r\nwas cut from the dead trees. At present this wood has largely decayed\r\nbeyond usefulness except for firewood, although in some areas it is\r\nbeing gathered for pulpwood. Sprouts have arisen from the bases of the\r\ntrunks and have borne nuts, but blight sooner or later destroys those\r\nsprouts.\r\n\r\nChinkapins are found in many counties of Virginia, especially on shale\r\nor sandy loam soils. Blight affects chinkapins to a considerable extent;\r\nbut because of their bushy type of growth, new shoots arise to replace\r\nblighted shoots, thus perpetuating the plants so that they have not died\r\nout. Chinkapins are gathered by children for eating and for sale along\r\nthe roadside, but at present they have little total economic value.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Asiatic Chestnuts+\r\n\r\nSince the native American chestnuts passed out of existence, there has\r\nbeen a gradually accumulating interest in the Asiatic species,\r\nespecially Chinese chestnuts, which appear superior, in blight\r\nresistance and nut quality to the Japanese species. The growing of these\r\nChinese chestnuts is such a new enterprise that its problems are not\r\nfully solved nor its opportunities fully explored.\r\n\r\nThe earlier plantings of seedling Chinese chestnut trees were made by\r\ncooperating growers and nurserymen. They were interested in a forest\r\ntype chestnut that might replace the dead native trees. A few of these\r\nplantings were made under semi-forest conditions, on cut-over timber\r\nland or on dry ridges. The first lesson that was learned was that the\r\nChinese chestnut is an orchard type tree requiring rather fertile soil\r\nand ample moisture. It would not compete favorably with most native\r\nforest trees, but rather was a slow growing, shallow rooted type of\r\ntree. Under these unfavorable growing conditions the trees tended to be\r\nsmall and to sprout from the bases of the trunks. The weakest seedlings\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the trees were planted in yards, back lots, along the\r\nsides of ravines, or in other locations where the soil was fertile and\r\nmoist. Under these favorable conditions most seedlings have grown and\r\nproduced crops of nuts, especially when the trees were pruned and\r\ncompeting weeds and brush were mowed. Very few of these first seedlings\r\nof the Chinese chestnuts showed much promise although a few of them were\r\nfairly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSeveral old Japanese chestnut trees have been observed. One of these is\r\nestimated to be 50 years of age with a trunk diameter of 18 inches and a\r\nheight of about 50 feet. It is growing in a very fertile spot and heavy\r\ncrops in the past have broken its limbs. Chinkapins growing nearby\r\nappeared to have supplied pollen. Recently the nearest chinkapins were\r\ncleared away and hence at present the nuts fail to fill well. Another\r\nlarge tree in eastern Virginia produces many burs but the nuts fail to\r\ndevelop, indicating self-sterility. The nuts of both trees are rather\r\ncoarse and of poor quality.\r\n\r\nMore recent plantings have been rather widely scattered over the state,\r\nalthough the total number of trees is not large and no one person has\r\nplanted many trees. One large general nursery, serving this area,\r\nreported sales last spring of 196 Chinese seedling trees to thirty-five\r\ndifferent customers. The largest single sale was for fifty trees.\r\nSeveral customers purchased only one tree each.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Problems Encountered+\r\n\r\nIn visiting and corresponding with individuals who are growing Chinese\r\nchestnuts, I have made a few observations, as to problems that have\r\narisen.\r\n\r\n+1. Site and Soil.+ The most successful trees from the standpoint of\r\ngrowth and production were those growing on fertile, well drained soil\r\nin which moisture was plentiful. The Chinese chestnut tree appears to be\r\nshallow rooted and to require good growing conditions. Dry ridges were\r\nunfavorable for growth, and in bottom land the trees frequently were\r\nsubjected to late spring freezing of tender shoots.\r\n\r\n2. Blight injury to the trees and weevil damage to the nuts seemed to be\r\nthe most serious enemies of chestnuts. Seedlings varied considerably in\r\ntheir resistance to blight. Some of them showed no indications of\r\nblight; others were damaged but outgrew the injury; and a few trees were\r\nweakened and died.\r\n\r\nWeevils appeared to be quite prevalent. One grower reported almost 100%\r\nwormy nuts. It is my understanding that a spray program has been\r\ndeveloped for control of the weevil. Mr. H. F. Stoke of Roanoke believes\r\nthat the Illinois No. 31-4 chestnut (a hybrid) is resistant to weevil,\r\nprobably because of its thick burs and closely set spines.\r\n\r\n+3. Cultural Care.+ Chinese chestnuts benefited from pruning; it being\r\nespecially important to cut away the sprouts at the bases of the trunks.\r\nMowing weeds and brush around the trees seemed helpful. Applications of\r\nnitrate of soda stimulated more rapid growth of young trees, and in\r\nlimited amounts benefited the older trees. It appears, however, that\r\nthere may be a danger of overstimulation which increases the hazard of\r\nlimb breakage by snow and ice, especially in the case of younger trees.\r\nThe largest crops of nuts, however, were frequently produced on trees of\r\nonly moderate vigor.\r\n\r\n+4. Freezing damage to the bark of the trunks and large limbs.+ This\r\noccurred in the VPI Horticultural Department planting in 1945, when a\r\ntemperature of about 17 deg.F. occurred after the trees had started growth\r\nin the spring. This injury appeared as a darkening of the outer bark and\r\ncambium. Trees that were severely damaged became weakened and tended to\r\nsprout vigorously from the bases of their trunks. Other trees overcame a\r\nslight injury with little apparent ill-effect.\r\n\r\n+5. Seedlings or Varieties.+ The question is whether to grow seedlings or\r\ngrafted varieties. Seedlings are more easily propagated, the nursery\r\nplants less expensive, and the trees longer lived on the average; but\r\nseedling trees and nuts are quite variable. Named varieties are\r\ndifficult to propagate, the nursery plants expensive, and stock-scion\r\nincompatability may occur; but the trees and nuts are uniform. Seedlings\r\nserve a useful purpose in developing new varieties; but with more\r\nplanting of superior varieties and a fuller understanding of propagation\r\nmethods, and of cultural care, chestnut growing on a commercial scale\r\nmay be more likely to become a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Future Prospects+\r\n\r\nFor the present, at least, it appears that growing Chinese chestnuts may\r\nbe limited to small specialty plantings rather than any large commercial\r\nenterprise. The trees seem well adapted to yard and back lot planting\r\nas ornamentals and to furnish the family with nuts. Also hobbyists and\r\nspecialists find them to be interesting plants with which to work.\r\n\r\nThe industry is new and involves uncertainties and risks, which a\r\ncommercial grower should not be expected to assume. Further study is\r\nneeded to clear up the uncertainties, especially as to production costs,\r\nmarkets, and profits to be expected. As additional trees come into\r\nbearing over a wider area, a better understanding may be had of the\r\neconomic value of these chestnuts in the various sections of the state.\r\nThere is a market for high quality chestnuts, but it remains to be seen\r\nwhether there will be sufficient profit with the risks involved to\r\nattract commercial growers.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Summary+\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the following points are to be stressed in regard to\r\ngrowing chestnuts in Virginia:\r\n\r\n(1) Chinese chestnuts are adapted for home planting or for planting by\r\nhobbyists and specialists; but their commercial prospects as yet are\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n(2) The trees require fertile soil with ample moisture but should not be\r\nplanted in frost pockets.\r\n\r\n(3) Weevils and blight have been the most serious pests.\r\n\r\n(4) Seedlings serve a useful purpose in developing new varieties; but\r\ngreater progress should be expected from growing superior named\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n(5) Additional study is needed to determine the profit prospects, to\r\nevaluate varieties, and to work out details of cultural practices,\r\nharvesting, and storage of nuts on a variety basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chestnut blight has destroyed the native _Castanea dentata_\r\ntrees, it is hoped that breeding programs may produce a blight\r\nresistant, hardy tree, of a size that will lend itself to orchard\r\nplanting and cultural practices, and which will be regularly productive\r\nof high quality nuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\nThe next thing on the program is the talk by Mr. G. S. Jones of Phenix\r\nCity, Alabama, on Growing Chestnuts in Lee County, Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing Chinese Chestnuts in Lee County, Alabama\r\n\r\nG. S. JONES, R.F.D. 1, Phenix City, Alabama\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since childhood, chestnuts have held a fascination for me. How well\r\nI remember the delightful Sunday afternoon trips we used to make in the\r\nfall up on Earkett's Hill to gather a few small nuts from some native\r\ntrees which often had been burned by woods fires. I occasionally revisit\r\nthis area to see these trees, which are in better condition now than\r\nthen. Native chestnuts were never, to my knowledge, very abundant in our\r\narea and are now indeed scarce, but I still hear of a few living trees,\r\nsome of which grow as far south as North Florida.\r\n\r\nI first became interested in Chinese chestnuts from an article I read in\r\nthe early '30's in a Department of Agriculture yearbook which I think\r\nhad been written by Mr. Gravatt. This article told about these trees\r\nbeing introduced into this country because of their high resistance to\r\nblight. Until this time I had heard little about chestnut blight. In\r\norder to find out more about these trees I wrote Mr. Gravatt, who in\r\nreply said seedling trees were available for distribution on an\r\nexperimental basis. I applied for some of these, more, I must admit, to\r\nget them to grow on our place just to have some chestnuts than with any\r\nthought of disease resistance. When these trees came in the spring of\r\n1934 I even had some trouble in getting permission to set them in an\r\nopen field near the house, for chestnuts were considered as a tree of\r\nminor importance, to be grown in some out of the way place.\r\n\r\nThese trees were set in sandy loam soil with a porous yellow subsoil in\r\na field of medium elevation which has excellent air drainage so I have\r\nhad little damage from cold injury. The soil is of fair fertility for\r\nthe Upper Costal Plain area. Of the trees sent me, fourteen of the ML\r\nselection, originating, I am informed by Mr. Gravatt, from seed obtained\r\nin Anhwei Province of China, and 10 MO selection originating in Chekiang\r\nProvince were set in my orchard. Only two of these failed to survive,\r\nleaving a total of twenty-two. These were cultivated with the field\r\ncrops, mostly cotton and corn, and I must admit didn't have much\r\nindividual attention for several years. I even left the side branches to\r\nminimize injury from the mule and plow used in cultivation. Some leaves\r\nand trash were put around them at times and they received some benefit\r\nfrom the fertilizer of the row crops. I mention this to show that my\r\nchestnuts grew quite well though only moderately fertilized, but\r\nreceiving good cultivation while young. I might mention that I set two\r\ntrees in stiff Piedmont clay soil a few miles above here, to try them\r\nunder woodland conditions. These have never done well, although one had\r\nburs but I found no nuts. Other trees which I observe have not been\r\ngiven cultivation grow very slowly, although I have not seen any tried\r\non what I would consider _good_ woodland areas.\r\n\r\nMy trees, spaced about 40 x 40 ft., have grown quite rapidly so that now\r\nsome of the limbs are almost touching. Tree ML No. 2, which is about\r\naverage size, measured last fall in diameter 12-1/2 inches, in height 24\r\nfeet, with a limb spread of 30 feet. By 1943 the trees were getting so\r\nlarge that cultivation was discontinued. An attempt is made to keep all\r\nlitter possible in the orchard, which, with the shade of the trees, has\r\ncaused much of the soil to become loose and mellow. Since our sandy soil\r\nis very low in calcium I applied limestone one time at the rate of about\r\n1500 lbs. per acre. This I hoped would improve the texture of the soil\r\nand make better conditions for growing bur clover between the trees.\r\nBasic slag which contains about 10% phosphate was applied at the rate of\r\nabout 600 lbs. per acre in the early '40's. For the last four or five\r\nyears I applied about 200 lbs. of guano (4-10-7 usually) and 200 lbs of\r\nbasic slag annually. Since 1944 I have been adding about 50 lbs. of\r\nminor mineral elements to the above mixture. Whether it is a coincidence\r\nor not I cannot say, but the next year after applying these elements my\r\nyields increased from 430 lbs. the previous year to 961 lbs. and have\r\nremained high ever since. Minor mineral elements show beneficial results\r\non our garden crops, and I am inclined to believe they are needed, since\r\nour soil is so sandy and porous, and especially the soil that has been\r\ncultivated so long. Since my trees have produced so well with this\r\nmoderate fertilization, I have made no check against higher rates of\r\napplication. In fact I am against the use of large amounts of mineral\r\nguanos since I know certain tender shrubs and plants are injured by\r\ntheir use and some soil bacteria and animal life are also harmfully\r\naffected, according to reports I have read.\r\n\r\nThree of my trees bore a few nuts at four years. No record of yields was\r\nkept until the seventh year or 1942, in which I gathered about 328 lbs.\r\nof nuts. After that my records show for 1943, 554 lbs., 1944--430 lbs;\r\n1945--961 lbs; 1946--1722 lbs; 1947--1554 lbs. No individual tree\r\nrecords were kept except in a few cases. I kept a rough record by\r\nlooking at the burs at the end of the season, and classed trees as\r\nexcellent, good, or poor producers, along with other characteristics of\r\nthe trees. However, I know several of my trees produced over 100 lbs.\r\neach in 1946 and one tree, ML No. 2, of which I kept a record by weight,\r\nin 1947 produced a little over 150 lbs. of nuts.\r\n\r\n[A note from Mr. Jones early in 1949 reports a crop of 1,836 pounds of\r\nchestnuts harvested from his 21 trees in 1948, the largest yield to\r\ndate. His ML No. 2 tree produced 165 pounds.]\r\n\r\nNuts on a few of my trees begin ripening the latter part of August, but\r\nSeptember is the heavy month, with some extending to the middle of\r\nOctober. Their early ripening period while the weather is usually hot\r\nand dry, I think tends to cause damage to nuts from the effects of the\r\nhot sun and rapid drying. Damage to the nuts and consequent spoilage can\r\nbe kept at a minimum if they are gathered promptly, which should be\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Preparing Chestnuts for Market+\r\n\r\nHere is how I generally handle my crop. As soon as the nuts are gathered\r\nI put them in a container with water and remove the nuts that float.\r\nThis eliminates practically all spoiled nuts and those beginning to\r\nspoil. Those that sink are then placed in coarse mesh burlap bags (about\r\n25 lbs. to the bag) which are tied near the top. These bags are laid on\r\na slatted platform under a shade tree and pressed out flat, so nuts will\r\nnot be thicker than 2 or 3 inches. These bags are thoroughly wet with\r\nwater once or twice daily, depending on the weather, until I can carry\r\nthem to cold storage and store at 30 deg.F., or they are marketed fresh,\r\nadvising buyer of the perishable nature of these nuts. Last year my nuts\r\nkept excellently in cold storage, and after remaining there about six\r\nweeks had dried sufficiently to keep much better after taking out than\r\nwhen they were fresh.\r\n\r\nNuts for planting purposes can be kept in excellent condition for\r\nseveral weeks by spreading them thinly between layers of damp sphagnum\r\nmoss and storing in a cool place. This cannot be allowed to get very wet\r\nor sprouting will begin. While holding the nuts out of cold storage I\r\nattempt to keep sufficient moisture available so the nuts are not\r\nallowed to dry much, and yet have plenty of ventilation to keep them\r\nfrom heating or souring. Until I began using this method, a large\r\npercentage of my nuts began spoiling soon after gathering, which caused\r\nme much discouragement, as I did not want to offer such a product for\r\nsale. Since then my losses still run around 12%, but this could be\r\nreduced still further by more prompt gathering and by the elimination of\r\nseveral trees which retain nuts in the burs to a large extent.\r\n\r\nI have been able to dispose of my nuts quite easily in near-by Columbus,\r\nGa. and for the last few years have had quite a demand for nuts to use\r\nin planting.\r\n\r\nMy orchard as a whole has been very healthy, showing no blight signs\r\nthat I can detect, although there is little chance of exposure to blight\r\nin my section. One tree is slowly dying, which may be due to cold\r\ninjury, as it comes into leaf early and also ripens very early. So far I\r\nhave noticed no damage from chestnut weevils. As my trees are seedlings,\r\nthere is quite a bit of variation in size of nuts and production of\r\nindividual trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Undesirable Traits in Seedling Trees+\r\n\r\nI might mention some undesirable traits which I notice in my trees.\r\nFirst, I would place retention of nuts in the burs as the worst trouble.\r\nThis is quite bad in five or six of my trees. Next, nuts too dry and\r\nloose in the hull at time of falling, which is present in four or five\r\ntrees, some of which retain nuts in the burs and some which do not. The\r\ndry textured nuts seem to spoil more easily than plump well filled ones.\r\nSome trees produce too small nuts but the trees which produce extra\r\nlarge nuts do not usually yield nearly so heavily as those producing\r\nsmall to medium size nuts. I consider too early ripening as undesirable,\r\nfor those that ripen later are usually better keepers, but this does not\r\nalways hold true as some of the later ripening ones are also poor\r\nkeepers.\r\n\r\nThis year my trees have an excellent crop of burs and show promise of a\r\ngood average yield on each tree. Considering all things, I am highly\r\npleased with my Chinese chestnuts and believe they have a good future in\r\nour section if no greater troubles arise than I now know of although\r\nthere is much room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Other Tree Crops+\r\n\r\nAlthough Chinese chestnuts are my largest producing tree crop, I am\r\nworking with a number of other trees and shrubs for both nut and fruit\r\nproduction, as well as other purposes. I have several Thomas black\r\nwalnuts which I set about 1938. Three of these have grown quite rapidly\r\nand are beginning to produce nice crops of nuts, although the kernels\r\nhave a tendency to be spongy at times.\r\n\r\nOf course, I have a small orchard of budded pecans, which do so well in\r\nour section. These trees, which are young, are just coming into\r\nproduction. Some other nut trees which I am trying in field plantings\r\ninclude native chestnuts, chinkapins, hazel nuts, native black walnuts,\r\nand scaly bark hickory (_Carya ovata_). Since most of these are young\r\nand grow so slowly, I cannot say much about their production yet. I have\r\nalso planted quite a large number of white oaks from a high production\r\ntree in hopes of producing acorns for hogs and wild life, also some cork\r\noaks on an experimental basis.\r\n\r\nAmong non-nut producers I am trying honeylocust, persimmons, and\r\nmulberries. I also grow catalpa and black locust for fence posts. This\r\nmakes no mention of the great variety of native timber trees such as\r\npines, tulip poplar, and others which I try to protect from fires so as\r\nto get as great a variety of trees as possible to use for various\r\npurposes. I also encourage the growth of ornamental trees and shrubs\r\nsuch as dogwood, redbud, and holly to add beauty to the landscape in\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Russell Smith's book, \"Tree Crops\" has been a great inspiration\r\nto me along these lines, and I am attempting to study and use as many\r\ntrees, shrubs, and plants here on my place as possible because I\r\nbelieve we can live easier and better and make better use of the land\r\nboth for ourselves and nature when we learn how to use our various\r\nnative plants to the best advantage along with many of the exotic ones.\r\n\r\nI might end by saying that I would much rather work in the shade of\r\ntrees than in the open sun and benefit by their long life and varied\r\nuses than to depend so heavily on short lived crops which often require\r\nsuch intensive care.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Jones. A very interesting paper with\r\ndetails that are worth listening to.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. C. Moore of the Department of Horticulture, Alabama\r\nPolytechnic Institute, will give us a talk on Processed Chestnuts on the\r\nMarket throughout the Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcessed Chestnuts on the Market throughout the Year\r\n\r\nJ. C. MOORE, Alabama Polytechnic Institute, Auburn, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Moore: Mr. President, members of the Association: I have a few\r\npackages here that I just wanted to pass around after we get through\r\nwith a short discourse on processed chestnuts. It might be somewhat of\r\nan inspiration to look while I talk a few minutes about it.\r\n\r\nThese nuts, of course, have been put up from the 1947 crop, but I have\r\nnuts put up in 1945 that are still in fair shape. The quality on the\r\n1945 product is not too good. The quality on the 1947 product is\r\nexcellent when the nut is hot. For instance, a toasted chestnut, I\r\nthink, has a quality that no other nut has. When the nut sits in a bag\r\nsealed for several weeks and gets cold it still is good, but it doesn't\r\nhave quite the crispness that it has when it is really fresh and hot.\r\n\r\nWe were very much disappointed with Chinese chestnuts when they first\r\nbegan to bear at Auburn. We got some plants from Mr. Gravatt and the\r\nBureau of Plant Industry in Beltsville in 1938. They were planted; some\r\nof them started bearing in 1941. The nuts were large in size; the trees\r\nseemed to be perfectly healthy. The early bearing habit gave us a great\r\ndeal of encouragement. Then we sampled these nuts, and the quality was\r\nnot good. While the nuts were green and in storage the nuts decomposed\r\nin just a few days' time.\r\n\r\nThe first nuts that we harvested in 1941 were picked, placed in paper\r\nbags, set in the office, and we forgot about them, because they were not\r\ngood when we put them in the bags, and we just put them back for our\r\nrecord purposes. A few days afterwards they were moldy and ruined. In\r\n1942 we had a little better crop, but again the nuts rotted. In 1943 we\r\nhad a still larger crop, and the nuts rotted again. We did not know how\r\nto take care of those nuts at the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1944 Mr. L. S. Holden was with the Soil Conservation Service. He was\r\ntransferred to Auburn at the time I was transferred down into Haiti to\r\ndo some work on rubber production, and he took my place at Auburn on the\r\nhillculture project. In the fall of 1944 Mr. Holden had an idea that he\r\ncould can those chestnuts and preserve them. So he took the nuts,\r\ncracked the hull off of the nut, ground it with a little food chopper,\r\nand placed the nuts in cans, pints and quarts, put them in a pressure\r\ncooker at 15 pounds pressure and cooked them for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1944, or after the crop was produced, Mr. Holden left\r\nAuburn, and he told me when he left that he had sent some of the samples\r\nto different parts of the United States and had gotten favorable replies\r\nfrom the samples that he had sent out. That gave me a renewed courage,\r\nand along with that in 1945 we sold quite a few raw nuts on the market\r\nat Auburn. Those nuts sold just like hot cakes for 40 cents a pound.\r\nThere were quite a few comments came back to us about those nuts. They\r\nwere the most beautiful nuts the people had ever seen, and several\r\ndifferent ones made comments that the nuts toasted had excellent quality\r\nand the nuts boiled had excellent quality, and raw nuts after they were\r\ncured had an excellent quality.\r\n\r\nThose few different peoples comment on the material and Mr. Holden's\r\nwork that he had done on canning gave me an idea that maybe he had\r\nsomething, and I have worked since that time trying to perfect a product\r\nthat would be edible from the hand from a cellophane-bag standpoint. At\r\nthe present time we have a plan worked out whereby we can produce large\r\nquantities of Chinese chestnuts in Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe thing that is going to confront us in the near future is the\r\nmarketing possibility. We have to handle Chinese chestnuts rapidly if we\r\nput them on the market raw. This processed method that we have has been\r\nworked out to perfection, we think, for cold storage purposes.\r\n\r\nNow, you can put Chinese chestnuts raw in cellophane bags and seal them\r\nwith a hot iron. These bags are not sealed. It is a non-sealable\r\ncellophane. I didn't get hold of the type of cellophane that you can\r\nseal. They are unsealed. They have been in this package about a week,\r\nand the nuts are in good shape. On cold storage I have held those nuts\r\nfor 40 days. Last year was the first time that I tried them in sealed\r\ncellophane, but sealed in cellophane bags in cold storage last year they\r\nremained perfectly good for 40 days. At that time the cold storage plant\r\nwent bad, and, of course, the nuts molded.\r\n\r\nWe think that on the cold storage proposition, and if you have followed\r\nfood processing and cold storage possibilities on strawberry shortcake,\r\nstrawberry pies, apple pies and other types of cold storage products, I\r\nthink when you go to the locker and pick out a little bag of lima beans\r\nin a cold storage locker or any other kind of cold packed foods, if you\r\nsee a pack that looks attractive, chestnuts, after you get accustomed to\r\ntheir flavor especially, it will be a difficult thing for you to fail to\r\npick up a bag of chestnuts and walk out with them among your other\r\ngrocery purchases. That type of marketing has possibilities throughout\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nWith that possibility from last year this crop came in. We had an\r\nexcellent crop. I contacted Mr. Harris, who is one of the professors\r\nworking with food processing at Auburn, and we went over the work quite\r\ncarefully together, what I had done and the possibilities for the work\r\nin the future, and with some suggestions from him and with his help we\r\nthink we have just about fixed a product that will be a permanent thing\r\non the grocery shelves throughout the year.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time all of the nuts that were canned in cans with the\r\nshells on developed throughout the year somewhat of a soured condition.\r\nWhen you opened the can and smelled, the odor was foul. When you cracked\r\nthe shell and tasted the nut, the flesh had just the least bit of a foul\r\nodor. Mr. Harris suggested that probably that was a flat sour. We\r\nweren't sure that it was flat sour, but we haven't had the bacteria\r\ncheck to find out whether it was caused by one of the thermophilic\r\nbacteria or not, but we are pretty confident that it was a flat sour\r\nthat caused the foul odor. With careful heating and careful drying we\r\nhave developed some products here that I think have a possibility, and\r\nthese products will maintain their quality throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nuts Cured Before Canning+\r\n\r\nI have canned chestnuts that have been canned for three years, and the\r\nquality is just as good as it was a month after they were canned. The\r\nproduct, however, when it is canned green does not have the quality that\r\nit does when it is canned after curing. The way we handle these, to\r\nbegin with, is to take the nuts from the field, put them on a woven wire\r\nand elevate the wire so that air can go under and over, cure at room\r\ntemperature for about three days. If you cure longer than three days you\r\nwill lose quite a few of your nuts. That is a rapid cure. We have not\r\ntried curing under cooler conditions to see if we can eliminate part of\r\nthe damage that is caused by deterioration, but curing the nuts rapidly\r\nyou get a deterioration on quite a few of the nuts after the third or\r\nfourth day. If you take the raw nuts three days cured rapidly where the\r\nair can circulate over and under, the quality is excellent raw, and I\r\nhave those nuts cured for three days in cellophane bags on cold storage\r\nthat can be sold throughout the year. Those nuts must be heated enough\r\nto stop the deterioration, whatever it is. It may be a physiological\r\ncondition, I am not sure, it may be a vitamin reaction, I am not sure,\r\nbut when the nut dries too fast it turns white on the inside, gets hard,\r\nloses its flavor, and it is no good.\r\n\r\nThis nut (indicating) canned in cans, I will give you the treatment for\r\nit. I told you we cured them on those drying racks for three days. Then\r\nwe put them in a pressure cooker and run the temperature up to about 10\r\npounds pressure for 30 minutes, take them out of the pressure cooker and\r\nhull them, and at that stage they hull quite easily. The hull itself\r\nwill turn loose from the nut quite easily if you heat it a little while\r\nbefore you try to hull. A machine which can thresh the hulls off very\r\neasily will be simple to develop. After the shell is taken off, then\r\nthey are put in an oven (a drying oven that has an automatic control at\r\n270 degrees), for about 10 minutes in order to evaporate the excess\r\nmoisture that you get in the steaming process. Then they are put in the\r\ncans hot, set back into the oven and heated for just a few moments to\r\nget your temperature up again and you put lids on at a boiling\r\ntemperature. You get quite a vacuum created by sealing them hot. We have\r\nhad as high as fourteen and a half pounds of vacuum on those cans the\r\nthird day after they were canned, and if you can get a vacuum like that\r\nby sealing the nuts hot, you can preserve their quality for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nI don't care if you open any bag that's here and taste these products.\r\nYou will find that the ones with the shells off are much better than the\r\nones with the shells on. I believe you will find that. However, the\r\nquality of the nut with the shell on is excellent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Hardy and some chestnuts prepared for storage\r\n(Courtesy Southern Agriculturist)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChestnut Growing in the Southeast\r\n\r\nMax B. Hardy,[2] Leeland Farms, Leesburg, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Introduction+\r\n\r\nJust about forty years ago the first blight resistant chestnuts were\r\nintroduced into the Southeast. This event was to have more far-reaching\r\neffects than could be foreseen at that time, as is illustrated by the\r\npresent extensive interest in the growing of these chestnuts as an\r\norchard crop.\r\n\r\nChestnut blight, a fungus disease of the native American chestnut\r\n(_Castanea dentata_ (Marsh) Borkh), first appeared on Long Island in\r\n1904 and destroyed this magnificent nut and timber tree. A Phytophthora\r\nroot disease added its toll so that a bearing tree of this species is a\r\nrarity in the East at the present time. The U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture began making introductions of two species of chestnut from\r\nthe Orient in 1906, both of which were resistant to the blight which was\r\nthen destroying the native American chestnut. Of the two species, the\r\nJapanese chestnut (_C. crenata_ Sieb. and Zuce.) and the Chinese\r\nchestnut (_C. mollissima_ Bl.), only the latter proved to have much\r\nmerit other than blight resistance and chestnut growing in the eastern\r\nUnited States in recent years has been confined almost entirely to the\r\nChinese chestnut.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five years ago, after the first introduction from the\r\nOrient of seed nuts of blight resistant chestnut species, the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture distributed a few seedling trees to various\r\ninterested growers in the Southeast. Some of these trees are still\r\ngrowing and bearing good crops of nuts and have reached rather large\r\nsize. The distribution of trees produced from nuts imported at\r\nsubsequent intervals was continued by the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture until rather widely scattered planting of several species\r\nunder varied soil, climatic, and cultural conditions was attained. As\r\ntime passed it became clear that only the Chinese chestnut had promise\r\nas a commercial crop for the production of nuts. As a timber tree none\r\nof the introduced species has as yet shown outstanding merit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Formerly Associate Pomologist, U. S. Pecan Field Station,\r\nU. S. Department of Agriculture, Albany, Georgia.]\r\n\r\n+General Observations+\r\n\r\nThe Chinese chestnut grows well throughout the southern part of the\r\nnatural range of the American chestnut and southward to the Gulf Coast,\r\nand possibly even into central Florida. Farther north it apparently\r\ngrows and produces better crops along the Atlantic Coast than inland,\r\nthus indicating the need of this species for a long growing season and\r\nfreedom from late spring and early fall frosts. In the plantings in\r\nGeorgia, from Atlanta to the southward, no loss of crop from late spring\r\nfrosts has ever been noted. In the Gulf States and northward along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard the Chinese chestnut tree is vigorous, healthy, and\r\nproductive, coming into bearing at a fairly early age and thereafter\r\nproducing regular crops. The trees grow to be rather large in size,\r\ndeveloping a somewhat rounded form with a spread of branches about equal\r\nto the height. Without pruning when young many sprouts usually develop\r\nnear the ground so that the mature tree has numerous trunks of about\r\nequal size, with the lower lateral branches resting on the ground.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the Chinese chestnut trees being grown at the present time\r\nare seedlings and exhibit a wide range of tree and nut characteristics.\r\nA few trees develop a somewhat more upright type of growth than that\r\ncommonly seen, but this type is generally less productive than trees of\r\nmore spreading habit, and the nuts are smaller and less desirable. Some\r\ntrees showing the most upright type of growth originated from nuts\r\nimported from the more northern provinces of China and may represent a\r\ndistinct strain or form of _Castanea mollissima_. The degree of\r\nincompatibility exhibited when southern China strains are grafted on\r\nnorthern China strains would indicate the same conclusion.\r\nUnfortunately, several different species or strains have been included\r\nin the plantings of most cooperators with the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture so that seedlings resulting from cross-pollination of these\r\ntypes may exhibit an even wider range of characteristics and performance\r\nfrom the standpoint of commercial production than is commonly seen at\r\npresent. A few of these hybrids may be superior to pure _C. mollissima\r\nseedlings_ in certain important respects because of hybrid vigor, but\r\ntaken as a whole the best types of _C. mollissima_ seedlings are\r\nsuperior to the other blight resistant species for purposes of nut\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe earliest introductions of blight resistant chestnuts from the Orient\r\nare represented by very few trees in the Southeast, but a small number\r\nof plantings of trees distributed in 1926 have been observed. These are\r\nproducing good nuts and the trees are quite healthy, regardless of\r\nconditions of planting except when they have been given no attention of\r\nany kind. In one planting the trees were planted about 10 feet apart on\r\nthe square with the result that they are tall and spindly with nut\r\nproduction only in the tops and very light on a per tree basis, which\r\nindicates the need of adequate spacing if the trees are to be vigorous\r\nand productive. Incidentally, this close spacing has not resulted in a\r\ndesirable timber type of growth.\r\n\r\nIn two other plantings the trees are planted in cleared areas in\r\ncut-over timber and then given no further attention. In both locations a\r\nfew trees are still living but are of no value either for timber or nut\r\nproduction. In still another planting on a bench about halfway up a\r\nmountain, where infrequent cultivation or mowing is practiced, the trees\r\nare growing and producing moderately well but the nuts are small. A few\r\nother scattered plantings of a few trees each are doing well around\r\nhomes though receiving only moderately good care.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of trees by the U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1935\r\nand 1937 has resulted in a few plantings that have done moderately well.\r\nIn one planting the trees are growing fairly well without care but are\r\nproducing few nuts. In another planting the trees are planted on rather\r\nheavy soil that is terraced; they are given applications of commercial\r\nfertilizers and infrequent cultivations and have been producing fairly\r\ngood crops of nuts in recent years. Still another planting of a\r\nconsiderable number of trees has been entirely removed through lack of\r\ninterest of the new owner. The plantings described have all been on\r\nprivate property.\r\n\r\nPlantings at various experiment stations have received somewhat more\r\nattention in general than those on private property; but because of lack\r\nof keeping quality of the nuts have not for the most part been accepted\r\nas a promising crop and have been the subject of very little study.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations it is evident that the Chinese chestnut\r\ncannot withstand the effects of crowding either in a solid planting or\r\nin competition with native growth. The trees have performed moderately\r\nwell with a minimum of care, but respond to good care by increased\r\nproduction and nut size. The rotting of the nuts soon after harvest as a\r\nresult of improper methods of handling and storage has prevented an\r\nearlier acceptance of the crop as of potential economic importance in\r\nthe Southeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Experimental Studies at the U. S. Pecan Field Station, Albany, Georgia+\r\n\r\nIn 1926, twenty-eight seedling trees of _Castanea mollissima_ were\r\nplanted in the Champion experimental block at Philema, near Albany,\r\nGeorgia. These trees grew well and began producing nuts in 1932. In\r\n1935, an additional 16 trees were planted in the same block. The trees\r\nin both plantings have shown good vegetative vigor and have been fairly\r\nproductive. All the variations common to any group of Chinese chestnut\r\nseedling trees have been in evidence. One or two trees have lacked\r\nvegetative vigor but have produced heavy crops of nuts for their size.\r\nType of bur opening has varied from free dropping of nuts to those burs\r\nfrom which the nuts are removed with difficulty; nut size has varied\r\nfrom about 35 to about 90 nuts per pound; the date of earliest and\r\nlatest ripening of the nuts varies by about three weeks; nut color has\r\nranged from light browns to dark mahogany and dark chocolate brown; and\r\nkeeping quality and eating quality have ranged from good to poor.\r\nHowever, nut production, as shown by the data presented in Table I has\r\nbeen good and nut quality has been acceptable, so that with increasing\r\nknowledge of the storage requirements of the nuts the trees have paid a\r\ngood profit in recent years. One of the older trees has consistently\r\nproduced close to 150 pounds of nuts each year for the past few years.\r\n\r\nSome of the trees in this planting have been topworked to selections\r\nfrom other plantings, including the variety Carr which showed up very\r\npoorly in comparison with most of the seedlings. Some of the trees have\r\nbeen culled out because of poor yield or nut size; and some have died as\r\na result of poor drainage.\r\n\r\nAn additional planting at Philema in the Brown tract was made in 1938.\r\nThe trees were planted in a portion of a five-acre block at some\r\ndistance from the original plantings, with a spacing of 25 feet apart on\r\nthe square in soil of rather light and sandy texture with fair subsoil\r\ndrainage. The fertility was low but has been improved through the use of\r\nwinter leguminous green manure crops and commercial fertilizers. Some of\r\nthe trees planted consisted of trees grown from carefully selected\r\n_Castanea mollissima_ nuts imported from south China and designated by\r\nthe initials MBA, MAY, MAZ, and MAX. Others carried the designating\r\nletters of \"FP.\" The nuts from which these trees were grown were\r\nimported by the Division of Forest Pathology of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture which also grew and distributed the trees. Still others were\r\nselections of _C. crenata_, the Japanese chestnut; and _C. mollissima_\r\nselections from an experimental planting in California were also\r\nincluded. In 1940 the remainder of the five-acre block was planted with\r\ntrees grown from seed produced by the original Philema planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable I.

Many of the trees\r\nhave produced nuts of outstanding size, attractiveness, eating quality,\r\nand keeping quality. There has been the usual degree of variation common\r\nto any collection of seedlings, but the best trees in this planting have\r\nbeen superior to any previously seen. Nut size has varied from 23 to\r\nmore than 100 to the pound; the color of the nuts has varied from light\r\ntan to deep mahogany, and a few are nearly black. All have been of good\r\neating quality. The keeping quality has varied materially, some keeping\r\nvery well and others quite poorly.\r\n\r\nBur opening, has likewise varied so that at one extreme the nuts drop\r\nentirely free from the burs on some trees and at the other extreme the\r\nburs drop with the nuts in them and considerable work is required to\r\nremove the nuts. It is out of this group of trees that the three\r\nseedlings have been selected that the U. S. Department of Agriculture is\r\nconsidering worthy of variety status. These have not yet been officially\r\nreleased and no official description is yet available. The yield data\r\nfor these three selected Seedlings are given in Table II.\r\n\r\n Table II.

Chiang\r\nKai-shek.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees of the \"FP\" designation and, of other species were grown to\r\nfruiting, but have since been removed or topworked in entirety because\r\nof their lack of desirable characteristics and because they produced\r\npollen for cross-pollination which would result in undesirable progeny\r\nwhen the _Castanea mollissima_ nuts were used for seed. Furthermore, a\r\nnumber of trees of the three-letter designations have been removed or\r\ntopworked because they produced very small nuts, or showed poor keeping\r\nquality, or because of some other undesirable characteristic. Therefore,\r\nthe nuts now being produced in this experimental orchard are of pure _C.\r\nmollissima_ inheritance of the best type, and, as such, represent some\r\nof the best and purest seed nuts available in this country today. This\r\nprocedure is being continued so as to maintain the quality of the nuts\r\nfor seed purposes at its present standard.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many of the nuts offered in the general trade for seed\r\npurposes at the present time are coming from orchards composed of a\r\nmixture of species or types comparable to the 1938 Philema planting\r\nbefore culling. This is very undesirable because of the great\r\nvariability in the nuts produced by trees with such an origin. When\r\ngrafted or budded trees of the newer and improved varieties are\r\navailable to orchardists chestnut growing for nut production may be\r\nbased on the same sound practices as the other fruit industries.\r\n\r\nIn the topworking of \"FP\" trees at Philema with scions from other\r\nstrains of _Castanea mollissima_ the degree of incompatibility has been\r\nso great, that the scion tops will have either blown out or died at the\r\nend of four or five years from grafting. At the present time this\r\nfailure can only be attributed to the fact that the stocks were of mixed\r\nancestry. On the other hand, scions of pure _C. mollissima_ placed on\r\nthe same stock strains have made good unions and are entirely normal\r\nafter as long as 13 years from grafting. This problem of incompatibility\r\nbetween stock and scion is one that yet remains to be completely solved.\r\n\r\nThe topworking of trees in the five-acre block at Philema has been\r\ngenerally successful where incompatibility is not a problem.\r\nBearing-size trees topworked one spring will generally produce a few\r\nnuts in the second subsequent growing-season. Growth the first year\r\nafter grafting will frequently be as much as 12 feet long and very\r\nstocky. Both cleft grafting and inlay bark grafting have been practiced,\r\nthe latter method proving to be the more satisfactory from all\r\nstandpoints. In this method of grafting scaffold limbs from 1 to 6\r\ninches in diameter are cut off square across. Scions 6 to 8 inches long\r\nare prepared by making a slanting cut 2 to 3 inches long and ending\r\nabout three-fourths through the scion at its basal end. A strip of bark\r\njust wide and long enough to receive the scion, with about one-half of\r\nthe upper end of the bevel showing above the cut surface of the stub, is\r\nthen removed from the stub. The scion is then nailed into place with\r\n5/8-inch nails and painted over with melted grafting wax. Two or three\r\nscions are required for most stubs. This work is done just as growth is\r\nstarting in the spring and the bark is slipping well. The scions may\r\ngenerally be cut directly from the trees, but sometimes they may need to\r\nbe cut several days earlier and stored in damp material in a\r\nrefrigerator to keep them dormant.\r\n\r\nIn south Georgia the Chinese chestnut normally begins growth soon after\r\nMarch 1, but in some years it has started as much as a month after this\r\ndate. Between south and north Georgia there is a differential in the\r\ntime growth starts in the spring of one to two weeks. This differential\r\nalso carries over into the date of blossoming and the date the harvest\r\nperiod begins. In south Georgia pollination generally occurs during the\r\nlatter part of April and early part of May, and the harvest period\r\nbegins about 100 days later. The peak of harvest averages 185 days after\r\nthe initiation of growth in the spring. Dormancy comes only after the\r\nfirst frost sufficiently heavy to kill the leaves, usually about two\r\nmonths after nut harvest is completed. This period between harvest and\r\nleaf fall is undoubtedly an important factor in the annual bearing habit\r\nof the chestnut in the Southeast since it permits the food reserves in\r\nthe tree to be replenished after the crop is mature. This is true under\r\nfavorable conditions but does not hold under conditions of crowding, low\r\nsoil fertility, or premature defoliation. For best growth and production\r\nthe tree should be in foliage approximately nine months out of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+ORCHARD MANAGEMENT+\r\n\r\nThe planting of chestnut trees in the Southeast should be done as soon\r\nas possible after the trees become dormant in the nursery. They should\r\nbe planted on fertile soil which is well drained but not subject to\r\nserious drought injury. The Chinese chestnut cannot withstand a high\r\nwater table, or free standing water, but appears to be somewhat\r\nresistant to drought injury when once well established. The chestnut\r\ntrees have not yet reached an age at which their largest potential size\r\nhas been attained, but trees of 50-foot spread have been observed. It\r\nappears likely, then, that orchards should be planted at 50 to 60-foot\r\ndistances on the square, unless closer planting and subsequent thinning\r\nis resorted to in order to build up high nut production per acre at an\r\nearlier age of the orchard. Planting distances of 25 x 25 feet, 30 x 30\r\nfeet, 25 x 50 feet, and 30 x 60 feet are recommended for this reason,\r\nbut only if the orchardist will plan to thin the stand at 10 to 15 years\r\nof orchard age and at later intervals as required. In no case should the\r\nbranches of adjacent trees be allowed to touch as under such conditions\r\ncompetition between trees will reduce the yield per tree and nut size,\r\nand induce alternate-year bearing.\r\n\r\nIn planting the young tree it is usually advisable to fill the hole in\r\nwhich the tree is to be set with top soil, packing it firmly around the\r\nroots as the hole is being filled. Usually no fertilizer is used at the\r\ntime of planting, although mixing about a handful of bone meal with the\r\nsoil around the roots has given a higher percentage of living trees and\r\nhas increased growth the first year. A shallow basin around the tree to\r\nfacilitate watering when necessary during the first growing season, or\r\nthe application of a mulch around the tree, or both, will be helpful in\r\nobtaining a high percentage of living trees and good growth. Adding\r\nwater at the time of planting is good insurance that the soil will be\r\nwell settled around the roots. A wrap of newspaper tied loosely around\r\nthe trunk of the young tree will aid in preventing winter injury and\r\nsun-scald.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of little or no care the seedling chestnut tree will\r\ngenerally develop several trunks as a result of the forcing of multiple\r\nsprouts from near the ground line. The tree should be trained to one\r\ntrunk, as such a form seems to be less susceptible to winter injury\r\nwhile young and makes a much more desirable orchard tree when older.\r\nPruning of the young trees subsequent to the development of the head at\r\na 4 to 5-foot height should be confined to the removal of crossing\r\nbranches and those so near to the ground as to interfere with the\r\nnecessary cultivation and harvesting work under the tree.\r\n\r\nMost soils in the Southeast are somewhat low in fertility and must\r\nreceive good care if chestnuts are to grow well. The annual application\r\nof commercial fertilizers is generally required as is the growing of a\r\nwinter green manure crop, preferably a legume. One of the most\r\nsatisfactory systems is to plant hairy vetch, Austrian winter peas, or\r\nblue lupine[6] in late October or early November, applying broadcast at\r\nthe time of planting from 400 to 600 pounds per acre of a 0-14-10 or\r\n0-14-7 fertilizer mixture. This green manure crop should then be disced\r\nin by April 15 of the following spring, with subsequent shallow\r\ncultivations at about six-week intervals through the growing season. The\r\nground should be clean by the middle of August to facilitate harvesting\r\nthe nuts. If such a system of culture is not feasible, as on too steep\r\nslopes or around buildings, mowing or mulching can be used to advantage,\r\nbut the trees must be given annual applications of a complete fertilizer\r\nmixture, such as 4-8-6, 6-8-8, or 5-7-5. These should be made each year\r\nabout a month before growth starts at a rate of 2 to 3 pounds for each\r\nyear of tree age. This should be broadcast under and slightly beyond the\r\nspread of the branches.\r\n\r\nIt has not yet been found necessary to spray the trees for the control\r\nof any disease or insect. This does not indicate that control measures\r\nmay not be required at some time in the future, for it is the history of\r\nhorticultural crops when planted in any concentration that diseases and\r\ninsects increase in number and degree of injury. As yet, the chestnut\r\nweevil has not been found at the lower elevations in the Southeast.\r\n\r\nIn a few plantings a condition causing some premature defoliation has\r\nbeen observed at infrequent intervals. The condition begins as a leaf\r\nscorch which may or may not develop to the point where the leaf drops.\r\nIt is thought to be caused by some mineral deficiency or unbalance\r\nassociated with erratic weather conditions, but the exact cause is yet\r\nunknown. A leaf spot disease has been observed but has caused no\r\nappreciable defoliation and no control measures have been thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Blue lupine is winter-hardy only in the warmer coastal\r\nareas, not adapted north of Columbus, Georgia, Meridian, Mississippi, or\r\nShreveport, Louisiana. Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Harvesting and Nut Storage+\r\n\r\nHarvesting of Chinese chestnuts has proved to have definite requirements\r\nif the nuts are to be obtained in the best possible condition. The nuts\r\nare quite susceptible to rots of several kinds and must be properly\r\nhandled to keep losses at a minimum. They are also very easily and\r\nquickly injured by exposure to the sun, with the consequent, high\r\ntemperatures and drying. If the nuts are to be stored for any length of\r\ntime, as is necessary when they are to be used for seed purposes and as\r\nwill be necessary when they are to be marketed for eating purposes\r\nduring the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons, it is paramount\r\nthat they be picked up from the orchard at not more than two-day\r\nintervals. Cleaning up all dropped nuts at daily intervals is most\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each day the harvested nuts must be placed in cold storage\r\nat temperatures between 32 deg.F. and 45 deg.F. It has been found that a nearly\r\nair-tight container is required in order to maintain a relative humidity\r\nof 100% and prevent too much drying of the nuts. A 50-pound tin lard can\r\nwith one 20d nail hole in the side near the lid has proven to be a good\r\ncontainer for large quantities and these same cans also make good\r\nshipping containers merely by wiring on the lids. One-gallon friction\r\ntop syrup cans with a single nail hole in the side make a good container\r\nfor smaller quantities. In air-tight containers the nuts do not decay\r\nbut germination capacity is quickly destroyed and bitter flavors develop\r\nquite rapidly. Nuts to be used for eating purposes shortly after harvest\r\nmay be stored at lower relative humidities but should be placed in cold\r\nstorage. A loss of about 15% in weight from the fresh weight of nuts is\r\nnecessary to reach proper eating quality. Nuts dried to this extent are\r\nsweet and palatable but cannot be stored for any length of time and fail\r\nto germinate well when planted.\r\n\r\nThe experimental study of chestnut storage problems is being continued\r\nwith the hope of working out still better methods. The manner of\r\nmarketing chestnuts so that they will reach the consumer in a desirable\r\ncondition also is still to be worked out, but it appears possible that\r\nretail cold storage and packaging in moisture-proof bags which are\r\npervious to CO_{2} and O_{2} give promise at present. Probably the most\r\npromising aid to an increased storage life of chestnuts will come\r\nthrough the selection of trees for propagation and planting that produce\r\nnuts of superior resistance to storage rots. There is rather great\r\nvariation among seedlings in this respect, some being-quite superior,\r\nalthough no completely resistant seedlings have yet been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Discussion and Conclusions+\r\n\r\nThe perishable nature of the nuts of the Chinese chestnut has probably\r\nbeen the greatest drawback to an earlier acceptance of this crop as an\r\nadjunct to the horticulture of the Southeast. It has been only in the\r\npast few years that enough has been learned about the harvesting and\r\nstorage requirements to permit the storing of these chestnuts so that\r\nthey can be marketed in an orderly manner either for eating or for seed\r\npurposes. Storage losses through periods up to six months have been held\r\nto less than 10% for a mixture of nuts from all the trees at Philema.\r\nStorage tests of nuts from individual trees have shown a range in\r\nkeeping quality from no loss after six months' storage to nearly 100%\r\nloss. By culling out the trees producing nuts with a high rate of\r\nspoilage under the best storage conditions it should be possible to\r\nreduce storage losses to a minimum. Every grower of seedling trees\r\nshould follow this same process of culling out or topworking trees\r\nproducing nuts of poor keeping quality if the industry is to grow and\r\nprosper, since otherwise the offering of spoiled nuts for sale to the\r\nconsumer will soon destroy the demand for the nuts.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that the Chinese chestnut tree is very well\r\nadapted to the Southeast. It has proven to be healthy, vigorous, and\r\nproductive. Yield records at Philema show actual yields of more than\r\n1,000 pounds per acre and potential average annual yields of 1,500 or\r\nmore pounds per acre are not out of reason. In 1947, in the Brown tract\r\nat Philema, if all the trees that bore nuts had been collected into a\r\nsolid block the yield per acre would have been nearly 2,500 pounds.\r\nCrowding of the trees in the Brown tract is becoming serious at 11 years\r\nof age with a 25 x 25 foot spacing. Alternate-year bearing is becoming\r\napparent and the stand of trees must be thinned immediately. Because of\r\nsuch potential yields and because rather extended storage of nuts of\r\nvaried keeping quality is now economically possible the future of the\r\nchestnut industry in the Southeast is very promising.\r\n\r\nThe selection and propagation of selected seedlings is desirable as a\r\nmeans of advancing the industry at a more rapid rate. The propagation of\r\nselected seedlings offers a problem because of lack of compatibility\r\nbetween some stocks and scions. Since the chestnut is almost completely\r\ncross-pollinated it may be necessary to develop special plantings of two\r\nor three selections as a source of seed nuts for the production of\r\nstocks. Such plantings might possibly produce seedlings of quite uniform\r\nand desirable characteristics, but this prospect, is not very promising.\r\nCertainly, the evidence points to the conclusion that scion selections\r\nmust be worked on stocks of the same strains if incompatibility is to be\r\nheld at a minimum.\r\n\r\nThere is a further problem in the propagation of varieties on seedling\r\nrootstocks in the nursery. Only one propagator appears to be having much\r\nsuccess in this art but others must learn it. Topworking of older trees\r\nby the inlay bark graft is generally successful and older seedling\r\norchards can be worked over to improved selections without difficulty so\r\nlong as the stocks are of compatible strains. Time will be required to\r\nwork out the details of the solution for this problem but they will be\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of improved seedlings for propagation the strictest\r\nattention should be paid to the important characteristics of tree\r\nvigor, precocity, productiveness, nut size, attractiveness, and keeping\r\nand eating quality, and type of bur opening. These characteristics have\r\nbeen previously discussed but it is well to emphasise their importance.\r\nThe tree that comes into bearing at an early age seems likely to be more\r\nproductive in later years. The nuts should be no smaller than 45 nuts to\r\nthe pound and be attractive to the eye of the buyer. Most individuals\r\nprefer nuts with a bright and shining surface free of fuzz and with a\r\nfairly rich mahogany or chocolate color. Keeping quality is, of course,\r\nof great importance and should be carefully determined. Eating quality\r\nis generally good but distinctly superior selections may be found in the\r\nfuture. For the most part eating quality is dependent on the proper\r\ncuring of the nuts. The type of bur opening is more important than\r\nusually considered, as it materially affects the satisfactory harvesting\r\nof the nuts. From the commercial standpoint it appears that the most\r\ndesirable bur should drop from the tree with the nuts still in it but be\r\nwell split so that the nuts can be readily removed. Such a bur type\r\nprevents exposure of the enclosed nuts to the hot sun while on the tree\r\nand reduces injurious drying to a minimum yet permits rapid gathering of\r\nthe nuts in the burs for later mechanical separation. Nuts that drop\r\nfree from the burs are more subject to injury by drying and require more\r\nhand work in gathering. Burs that do not split readily would be more\r\ndifficult to separate mechanically; and mechanical aids will be\r\nnecessary for the economical daily gathering of the nuts in commercial\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nIf is encouraging to note that many of the present new plantings in the\r\nSoutheast are being made by orchardists rather than hobbyists. Many home\r\nowners are planting a few trees but the acceptance of the Chinese\r\nchestnut for commercial production by men already growing other orchard\r\ncrops portends the future success of the industry. The hobbyist has been\r\nof great service and should be given full credit for his far-sighted\r\ninterest in a crop that now has commercial promise, especially in the\r\nSoutheast. Much experimental work is still needed by both State and\r\nFederal agencies and by individuals. This work needs be concerned now\r\nmore with details of refinement rather than with basic possibilities of\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Mr. Carroll D. Bush, of whom I am sure you have\r\noften heard and whom very few of you, including myself, have met, of\r\nGrapeview, Washington, will now tell us something about the Marketing of\r\nChestnuts on the Pacific Coast. Mr. Bush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing Chestnuts on the Pacific Coast\r\n\r\nCARROLL D. BUSH, Grapeview, Washington\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bush: Friends of the Association: There are so many here that I have\r\nknown through correspondence that I have welcomed this opportunity to\r\nsay something to you today. I don't think that I will add very much to\r\nanything that has been said. I hope perhaps we will have some ideas from\r\nwhat we have been doing on the Coast.\r\n\r\nWe were in the nursery business near Portland, and during the war we\r\nwent out of it, but we are working back in trees again[7], and all this\r\ntime we have been preaching the gospel of nut trees, and we find that we\r\ncan't preach a gospel unless there is some reward. There is no market\r\nfor chestnuts in our section of the country, and yet we had quite a few\r\nof them around Portland. We could not talk about chestnut trees when\r\nthere was no market. Buyers there had been offering as low as three\r\ncents a pound or not buying them at all, and we, ourselves, had quite a\r\nfew nuts to sell. So I took a trip up to Seattle and found a commission\r\nman there that would take our nuts and arranged with him, and we have\r\nsent nuts to Seattle ever since that year and got a very good price.\r\nThen a neighbor had me send some of his, and we are still sending nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Introduced on Mid-West Markets+\r\n\r\nThe next year through Carl Weschcke of St. Paul I got in touch with a\r\nreliable Minneapolis firm. They evidently had been burned and they were\r\nsomewhat skeptical. They said if we would send a sample there they would\r\nlook them over. So I went out and picked up a mixed sample and shipped\r\nto Minneapolis, and they said if we could send nuts as good as the\r\nsample they could use some.\r\n\r\nWe began to send them. When we shipped them we made sure we sent nuts\r\nthat were considerably better than the sample, and the rewards for\r\nshipping there were also very good. Then we went on to Chicago, and we\r\nhave been shipping to Chicago over since. At this time I am out here to\r\nfind a little more market for some of the nuts that we have in Oregon.\r\n\r\nAt first we put the nuts in cold storage at about 32 degrees, expecting\r\nto get a better price on the Thanksgiving market. We found out that we\r\nwere making a mistake and that the earliest nuts on the market brought\r\nus our best price. So now we are shipping just as early as we can ship.\r\n\r\nWe first adopted the western cranberry box as being open enough to allow\r\na little drying off and tight enough so that it wouldn't allow too much\r\nand yet we didn't get any mold. We were very much afraid of that,\r\nbecause a good many of the California chestnuts had molded on the way to\r\nmarket. Later we turned to the splint bushel basket, and lately we have\r\nbeen in favor of the half-bushel basket. There seem to be buyers who\r\ndon't like to stock up more than a half bushel at a time, chestnuts\r\nbeing of a rather high price. They dry out too fast.\r\n\r\nWe found that cold storage above 32 degrees keeps chestnuts in good\r\ncondition with little dry-out. One dealer in Oregon we know of wraps his\r\ncold storage nuts in waterproof paper, keeps them that way clear on into\r\nJanuary. A very little mold will develop on chestnuts kept in storage\r\nfrom 32 to 35 degrees, but not enough so we take any precaution. We have\r\nhad a few batches that people have stood in sacks on damp nights, and\r\nthey started to mold, especially on the open end, and we find we can\r\nkill the mold with Clorox. We have just used a little Clorox in water.\r\nWe think this would prevent mold from developing on all nuts if they\r\nwere put through a chlorine bath. We haven't taken the trouble to do\r\nthat. I might say our walnuts, and filberts have been put through a\r\nchlorine solution, and, of course, after a chlorine solution is used you\r\nhave to put the nuts through water again and wash that off.\r\n\r\nWe have on our place a nice washer. We have graded the European\r\nvarieties, which we handle mostly, into three grades: standard, fancy,\r\nand extra fancy, by size. All our grading has been done by hand, except\r\nwe expect to have a simple grader this year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Mr. Bush informed the secretary by letter, early in 1949,\r\nthat he did not then have any nursery stock ready for sale at his Eagle\r\nCreek, Oregon, nursery. From that location about 10 years ago he\r\nintroduced, under numbers, three selections of Chinese chestnuts grown\r\nfrom seed imported in the early 30's. Two of these, in 1941, were named\r\nAbundance and Honan. The Abundance is now considered one of the most\r\ndesirable varieties from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania, while Honan is\r\nslightly less desirable.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+\"Sweet\" Nuts Sell Faster+\r\n\r\nWe have a few \"sweets.\" All of those on our farms are Riehl varieties,\r\nhybrids, I think. All of our European chestnuts have an astringent\r\npellicle, heavy with tannic acid. We classify as sweets any of those\r\nthat have a pellicle that is sweet enough to be eaten. We label these\r\nthe sweets and mark them as they go into the market. And while, I say,\r\nwe don't seem to get a better price for the sweets than for the\r\nEuropean, they do sell faster. There are some people in the eastern\r\ncities that are grabbing these in preference to the large ones. While\r\nthe large nuts sell very well, I suppose they go to the Italians and\r\nEuropeans who are used to cooking them, and out on the West Coast\r\nnothing but the large nut goes; the larger the better. In the Seattle\r\nmarket we try to send in large nuts.\r\n\r\nWe also grade out all \"cracks\" by hand. They mold easily, and we have a\r\nlot of cracked nuts in our climate there, but we have been able to\r\ndispose of all of these through the Seattle market where they move off\r\nvery fast and are lower priced.\r\n\r\n\r\n+California Supplies Distant Markets+\r\n\r\nLast winter we went to California and looked into the chestnut market\r\nthere. We found them in the Sierras and found them growing in the Coast\r\nRange without irrigation, but the largest growers were in the San\r\nJoaquin Valley near Stockton. The largest grove was 30 acres at Linden\r\nowned by Caesar De Martini. He gave us our best insight into California\r\nchestnut growing. He used to grade and package his own, and he still has\r\nhis cylinder grader. It has three different size holes, one inch, one\r\nand a quarter and one and a half. Anything that goes through the\r\none-inch hole is discarded as a cull. That leaves three sizes, the size\r\nthat goes through the one and a quarter, the one and a half, and the\r\nsize that goes out the end, which is, of course, a class of jumbos.\r\n\r\nAll the chestnuts in California, I think, now go to buyers to do the\r\ngrading and packing much as De Martini worked out. All of the California\r\nnuts have to be soaked in water just as Mr. Jones does, as they come to\r\nthe packer dried out. The largest buyer that we found in California\r\nshipped about seven carloads, and he shipped them all over the world,\r\nthe Philippines, Honolulu, Alaska, and other places where the chestnut\r\nhasn't been growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Early Autumn Best Marketing Season+\r\n\r\nNow, I am going to sum up what our experience has been and what we\r\nrecommend as general from our experience. Your experience may be\r\ndifferent. We clean the nuts, wash them, if necessary, grade them; large\r\nand small nuts do not sell well together. We would pack in baskets, half\r\nbushel for sweets. We are trying to make that half bushel basket the\r\nmark of the sweet nut in the markets where we sell, so that when a buyer\r\ncomes in there and sees a half bushel basket he knows that's sweets.\r\nThen we ship as wet as possible, and they dry out on the way. And just\r\nas fast as we can get those nuts off the ground we pack them and ship\r\nthem. Our greatest trouble now is, of course, the imported chestnut.\r\nThey are beginning to come in in great quantities, and they hit the\r\nmarket in Chicago last year at about the 20th of October, and we tried\r\nto beat that line if we possibly can with our nuts, because just the\r\nminute the carloads of chestnuts come in on the East Coast the market\r\ndrops right down.\r\n\r\nWithout question we could use some of the preparations that we use on\r\nfilberts to put a gloss on the chestnut, run them through, I think it is\r\na paraffin mixture, put a gloss on the shell and give us a better\r\nchestnut in the market, make it look nicer and, of course, make it sell\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n+\"Stick-tight\" Burs Preferred for Pacific Coast+\r\n\r\nI disagree, I think, with two of the former speakers in regard to the\r\nchestnut that falls free from the bur. I would prefer a chestnut that\r\nsticks tight to the bur. We have threshers out there that thresh them\r\nout. We can pick up those nuts in the bur with a shovel or fork, throw\r\nthem into the wagon, take them in the wagon, thresh them out. You have a\r\ncleaner nut, you don't have to pick around on the ground with rubber\r\ngloves that we use, which is easy enough, but it certainly adds a great\r\ndeal of work as compared to threshing them out easily after they are\r\nonce picked up.\r\n\r\nI thank you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Bush. We are glad to have that\r\nwestern angle. It is going to be very useful to us.\r\n\r\nNext on the program is a paper on the Control of the Chestnut Weevil,\r\nthe author of which is absent, but I believe Mr. Gravatt is going to\r\nread that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChestnut Weevils and Their Control with DDT\r\n\r\nE. R. VAN LEEUWEN\r\n\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research\r\nAdministration, Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, Division of\r\nFruit Insect Investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure of the American chestnut to resist the chestnut blight has\r\nresulted in the planting of a few blight-resistant species obtained from\r\nforeign lands. These foreign chestnuts would now be planted more\r\nextensively in certain districts, were it not for the fact that the nuts\r\nare injured by two species of weevils, for which heretofore there has\r\nbeen no practical control.\r\n\r\nThe 1947 season marks the fourth year of the experimental use of DDT for\r\ncontrol of the chestnut weevils. During these years our knowledge of the\r\nspray and how best to use it has been advanced by conducting laboratory\r\nand field tests. Unfortunately, few chestnut orchards now exist in the\r\nEastern States, and the scattered plantings consist mostly of a large\r\nnumber of Asiatic seedlings, some of which had to be top-worked to other\r\nAsiatic species and varieties. Many of these trees are grown for\r\nornamental, shade, or timber purposes rather than for nut production.\r\nOwing to these conditions and to a series of spring frosts since 1945,\r\nit has been impossible to conduct insecticide experiments on an adequate\r\nbasis of replicated plats.\r\n\r\nAlthough much is to be learned regarding time of application of the\r\nsprays and the proper dosage, the use of DDT can be recommended as a\r\nstandard practice, because it has proved highly valuable in protecting\r\nchestnut trees from heavy losses due to the chestnut weevil. It is the\r\npurpose of this paper to discuss some of the experiments that have been\r\nmade with DDT and the observations made on the time of egg deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nature and Extent of Injury+\r\n\r\nThe worms attacking chestnuts are the larvae of two very similar species\r\nof weevils, one larger than the other. The adults are medium-sized\r\nbeetles having extremely long, slender beaks. With these they drill\r\nthrough the husk of the nuts, making openings through which they insert\r\ntheir eggs into the nuts. From these eggs the familiar worms develop.\r\nWeevil injury varies greatly in different chestnut-growing localities.\r\nIt is not unusual for 50 to 75 percent of the nuts to be wormy, and\r\noften infestation reaches 90 to 100 per cent. The small weevil does the\r\nmost damage, but there are indications that this may not always be true.\r\nBecause the mouth parts of the adult are situated at the end of an\r\nextremely long and slender beak, it can obtain most of its food from\r\nbeneath the surface of the host plant. For this reason, stomach poisons\r\napplied to trees have not been eaten by these weevils, and hence have\r\nbeen of no practical value. As DDT kills by contact, it is necessary\r\nonly for the body of the insect to come in contact with DDT.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Life Histories of the Weevils+\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Beltsville, Md., the adults of the large chestnut\r\nweevil[8] leave the soil about August 15. The date will vary, of course,\r\nwith season and locality. Both males and females soon begin to feed by\r\npiercing the burs with their long beaks. Mating begins soon after the\r\nweevils collect on the trees, and egg laying follows shortly. The eggs\r\nhatch within a few days and the worms develop within the nut. A few of\r\nthe worms will complete their growth and leave before the nuts fall, but\r\nmost of them emerge from the nuts after they have fallen. The worms then\r\nenter the soil, where they build cells and remain until they change to\r\npupae the following summer. This weevil has a one-year cycle, or one\r\ngeneration a year.\r\n\r\nThe life history of the small chestnut weevil[9] is somewhat similar,\r\nexcept that in the vicinity of Beltsville the weevils leave the soil\r\nlate in May or early in June, when the trees are in bloom. Several weeks\r\nlater the females deposit eggs in the nuts. At Beltsville, egg laying\r\nbegins late in August and continues for several weeks. After the nuts\r\nhave fallen from the tree, the full-grown larvae leave them and enter\r\nthe soil. Earthen cells are constructed at a depth of 4 to 12 inches,\r\nwhere some of the larvae remain for two winters.\r\n\r\nThe small chestnut weevil completes its life cycle in two years, and a\r\nsmall percentage requires three years, whereas the large chestnut weevil\r\ncompletes its transformation from egg to adult in one year. The large\r\nweevils pass the winter as larvae, whereas the small weevils pass one\r\nwinter as larvae and the second winter as adults. With the few\r\nindividuals of the small weevil which require three years for\r\ntransformation, the first two winters are passed in the ground as larvae\r\nand the third in the same location as adults. This habit of the small\r\nweevil complicates control measures, as one season's spraying with DDT\r\ndoes not reduce the entire infestation of weevils.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: +Curculio proboscideus+ Fab.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Proper Time for Spray Applications+\r\n\r\nApplication of DDT sprays at the proper time is very important. An\r\nexamination in 1944 of many unopened chestnut burs disclosed the fact\r\nthat eggs of the small chestnut weevil were being deposited many weeks\r\nbefore the burs would open. It was also noted that great numbers of the\r\nlarvae were leaving the nuts soon after the burs cracked open. Evidently\r\nthese full-grown larvae had hatched from eggs deposited several weeks\r\nbefore the burs split.\r\n\r\nIn 1945, 1946, and 1947, cloth bags were tied over developing burs at\r\nvarious intervals during the season to prevent further egg laying in the\r\nnuts. At harvest time, the bags were removed and the nuts examined.\r\nOccasionally adults were hidden among the spines of the burs and were\r\ninadvertently enclosed in the bags; therefore, all nuts in bags\r\ncontaining female adults that might have continued ovipositing were\r\ndiscarded. The data in Table 1 show the approximate time prior to which\r\nthe nuts were infested.\r\n\r\nBecause of difficulty in obtaining sufficient burs for bagging, and\r\nother orchard conditions, the results of these studies were far from\r\nconclusive. They indicated, however, that many eggs had been deposited\r\nin the nuts before the burs had reached maturity. They also suggested\r\nthat the seasonal histories of the two species are closely parallel. At\r\nGlenn Dale, Md., and Fairfax, Va., the small weevils predominated,\r\nconstituting about 69 to 90 per cent of the total numbers taken. At\r\nElkton, Md., only 42 per cent of the weevils were of the small species.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Curculio auriger Casey.]\r\n\r\n   Table 1.

Five trees were sprayed with from 1 to 5 pounds of\r\ntechnical DDT plus 1/2 pound of sodium lauryl sulfate to 100 gallons of\r\nwater, and the sixth tree was left untreated as a check. A thorough\r\napplication of a coarse, drenching spray at a pressure of 400 pounds per\r\nsquare inch was used in an attempt to force the DDT between the many\r\nspines of the burs. The DDT used was very coarse, and difficulty was\r\nexperienced in getting a proper suspension. This formula was used,\r\nhowever, in preference to one which contained other ingredients that\r\nmight have formed a protective coating over the particles of DDT. Heavy\r\nrains prevented later spray applications.\r\n\r\nAdult weevils obtained by jarring untreated trees were then confined in\r\nscreen cages placed over the lower branches of the trees. At the end of\r\neach cage was a cloth sleeve which was tied to the limb to hold the cage\r\nin place. The treatments used and the results are given in Table 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2.

The results indicate\r\ndefinitely that DDT is toxic to the adults of both species of weevils.\r\nNo consistent differences between species were noted.\r\n\r\nAs the matured nuts dropped from the treated trees, daily collections\r\nwere made, and one-third of each collection was used as a sample in\r\ndetermining the percentage of wormy nuts. At the time the nuts drop, the\r\nholes in the shell through which the eggs were inserted are very\r\ndifficult to detect. The nuts were therefore held in wire baskets to\r\npermit most of the larvae to emerge before the final examination. All\r\nnuts not showing exit holes were cut open to find out whether they were\r\nwormy. The marked increase in clean nuts after all treatments indicates\r\nthat DDT is a promising insecticide for use against the weevils. The\r\ntreatment and infestation records for the sprayed trees and the check\r\ntree are given in Table 3, which also includes the results obtained in\r\nlater years.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Spray Experiments 1945 to 1947+\r\n\r\nSpring frosts in 1945 destroyed 95 per cent of the crop of chestnuts in\r\nthe Eastern States. Only six trees of different species and ages in the\r\nGovernment orchard at Glenn Dale, had sufficient nuts for experimental\r\npurposes. Applications of a 50 per cent DDT wettable powder in the\r\nproportions of 4 and 6 pounds plus 1/2 gallon of summer oil as a sticker\r\nto 100 gallons of water were made on August 20 and September 9.\r\n\r\nSpring frosts again damaged the orchards in 1946, destroying about 80\r\nper cent of the possible chestnut crop, and leaving only eight trees in\r\nthe Government orchard that were suitable for experimental purposes. The\r\nremaining trees having a small scattered crop were disregarded. A\r\nmixture consisting of equal parts by weight of DDT and kaolin 41 was\r\nused in the strength of 2 pounds of DDT to 100 gallons of water. The\r\ntime and number of applications were varied.\r\n\r\nTable 3.

Spring frosts injured 50 per cent of the chestnut crop at\r\nGlenn Dale and 70 per cent at Elkton, and as a result only a few trees\r\nsuitable for tests were available. The remaining trees were not\r\nsprayed. Four pounds of the standard mixture of equal parts of DDT and\r\nkaolin were used to 100 gallons of water in all applications.\r\n\r\nIn Table 3 will be found information on the quantities of DDT used, the\r\nschedules followed, and the results obtained during the period 1944\r\nthrough 1947.\r\n\r\nThese results indicate clearly the effectiveness of DDT in chestnut\r\nweevil control, in spite of numerous discrepancies brought about by the\r\nsmall number and variability of the trees available for the tests. As\r\nmight be expected, programs of three applications were more effective\r\nthan those of only one or two. Of the single applications, those put on\r\nduring the latter half of August were much more effective than those\r\nmade during the first half of September, presumably because most of the\r\neggs had been laid by the early part of September.\r\n\r\nThese experiments gave fairly exact information on the relative\r\nabundance of the two species of weevils. At Glenn Dale the small\r\nchestnut weevil constituted 92 to 98 per cent of the population; at\r\nElkton, 61 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe matured nuts that fell from count trees were collected daily, and\r\none-third of each lot collected was used as a sample for determining the\r\npercentage of wormy nuts. It was possible, therefore, to obtain a rough\r\nestimate of the numbers of larvae produced on each tree. In 1946, from\r\n1,863 nuts on a tree sprayed three times, 429 larvae emerged; and from a\r\ncomparable unsprayed tree having 2,610 nuts 16,494 larvae emerged. In\r\n1947, 1,350 larvae were produced on 9 trees with an average crop of\r\n1,361 nuts sprayed three times, compared with 14,505 larvae from 2,922\r\nnuts on an unsprayed tree. These figures indicate that DDT sprays bring\r\nabout large decreases in the numbers of weevils and that the proper use\r\nof DDT sprays on all host trees over a period of a few years would\r\ndoubtless reduce the infestation to a point where fewer applications\r\nwould be necessary for effective control of the chestnut weevils.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tentative Recommendations+\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who wish to try DDT for chestnut weevil\r\ncontrol, the following tentative recommendation is made:\r\n\r\nThoroughly apply +to all parts of the tree+ 2 pounds of DDT in 100 gallons\r\nof water. For example, use 4 pounds of a wettable powder that contains\r\n50 per cent of DDT, or 8 pounds of one that contains 25 per cent of DDT.\r\nMake three applications, the first about 30 days before the first nut is\r\ndue to drop, and the second and third after intervals of 12 days. Unless\r\nthe entire bur, especially that portion near the stem end where most of\r\nthe feeding punctures are made, +is thoroughly covered+ with a film of\r\nDDT, the weevils may feed without being affected by the insecticide. In\r\nhandling DDT, one should use the same care as with such well-known\r\npoisons as lead arsenate, Paris green, calcium arsenate, and nicotine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I might say that Mr. Van Leeuwen has used only a small\r\nsection of our experimental orchard, and right near-by would be large\r\nsections not used. The weevils are not killed quickly by the DDT, they\r\nare somewhat resistant, and so we think quite a number of weevils come\r\nover and deposit eggs before they are killed by this DDT, because they\r\ndon't lose any time getting to work on the nuts. He hopes to have much\r\nbetter results where the entire orchard is sprayed. This year we\r\nsprayed our entire orchard twice, and it is a real pleasure to go out\r\nthere now and gather up nuts and not be eating weevils when we do eat\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Well, Mr. Gravatt will now give us a talk on\r\nDiseases Affecting the Success of Tree Crop Plantings, and I am sure we\r\nall are on our toes to hear about that. Mr. Gravatt.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I only ask a few minutes to show a few slides.\r\n\r\n(Slides shown.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases Affecting the Success of Tree Crop Plantings\r\n\r\nG. F. GRAVATT and DONALD C. STOUT\r\n\r\nDivision of Forest Pathology, Plant Industry Station, Beltsville,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMass plantings of many trees of the same kind frequently result in an\r\nincrease in the severity of insect pests and diseases. Leaf diseases,\r\nfor instance, spread quickly through such plantings when weather\r\nconditions favor growth of the causal organisms. Plants on sites\r\nunfavorable to a specific tree species also are responsible for disease\r\nincreases. Chinese chestnuts grown on a site where they are subject to\r\nearly-fall and late-spring frosts will fail. Not only will crops be\r\nreduced by the killing of buds or blooms, but the twigs, or even whole\r\ntrees, may be killed by freezing. The blight fungus develops rapidly on\r\nsuch injured trees and may mislead people into thinking that the blight\r\nfungus is the primary cause of the killing.\r\n\r\nStill another factor that determines the damage by diseases, and thus\r\nthe success or failure of nut tree plantings, is the ignoring of soil\r\nand fertilizer requirements. Trees weakened by drought, because they are\r\non a site having a soil too shallow for good root growth, are much more\r\nsubject to attack even by weakly parasitic fungi than those growing on a\r\nsite with deeper soil. Innumerable dying twigs and branches with fungi\r\ngrowing on them are sent to the U. S. Department of Agriculture or State\r\nexperiment stations with requests that the disease be identified, when\r\nthe real trouble is lack of water for the roots. Weak trees are much\r\nmore subject to winter injury than vigorous ones.\r\n\r\nTrees require a good supply of plant food materials and water to produce\r\nprofitable crops. Tho heaviest bearing chestnut trees we have observed\r\nwere grown in an irrigated orchard in California and in a poultry yard\r\nin the East where chicken droppings actually formed a mulch under the\r\ntrees. However, if you wish to kill a young chestnut tree quickly, just\r\napply a very heavy application of chicken manure; the point is that\r\ntrees must become adjusted to chicken manure by gradual applications.\r\n\r\nAnother way to damage a tree is to keep it growing late in the fall by\r\ncultivation and fertilizers so that it does not harden off properly.\r\nMany plantings, representing heavy investments, fail because of lack of\r\norganic matter in the soil. This is related to water-holding and\r\nwater-supplying capacity of the soil, and lack of proper fertilizer. Dr.\r\nHarley L. Crane and his assistants, in their work with tung and pecan\r\ntrees, have shown the vital need for certain elements on some soils.\r\nTrees weakened by the lack of these elements are early prey for some\r\ndiseases. The element most frequently deficient is nitrogen, but\r\nsometimes boron, copper, or iron is lacking; or the elements are not in\r\nbalance, because of the excess of some, or the lack of others.\r\n\r\nBy adjusting the various soil, water, and site factors necessary for a\r\ncontinuous, vigorous growth of trees, many so-called disease conditions\r\nare eliminated. Many fungi and viruses, however, will attack trees in\r\nthe pink of condition; a few of the more important of these are treated\r\nin the following sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chestnut Blight+\r\n\r\nThe destruction by blight of the native stands of the American chestnut,\r\nand of the small eastern orchard industry based on European and American\r\nchestnuts and their hybrids is almost complete. Blight has been found in\r\nthe planted European chestnut orchards of the Pacific Coast from time to\r\ntime, but it has been kept under control by eradication. Chestnut trees\r\nor nuts from the eastern States, where blight is common, should not be\r\nshipped into the Rocky Mountain or Pacific Coast States.\r\n\r\nFinding the Asiatic chestnuts resistant to the blight, the Division of\r\nForest Pathology sent R. Kent Beattie to Asia to make selections of\r\nchestnuts for introduction into this country. Later Peter Liu, a Chinese\r\ncollector who worked with Mr. Beattie, continued to select Chinese\r\nchestnuts for introduction. These introductions, together with the\r\nearlier ones made by the Division of Plant Exploration and Introduction,\r\nwere grown at Chico, Calif., Savannah, Ga., and Bell, or Glenn Dale, Md.\r\nAltogether some 300,000 chestnut trees, of pure species and hybrids,\r\nwere distributed to cooperators for forest and orchard plantings. (Fig.\r\n1.) These constituted a fine lot of material from many parts of Asia as\r\na basis for selecting the best ones for our use. Private nurseries and\r\nState game and forestry departments are now growing these chestnuts and\r\nthe Division of Forest Pathology has discontinued general distribution\r\nof trees to cooperators.\r\n\r\nChinese chestnuts have proved to be the most valuable for forest,\r\norchard and ornamental use. The Japanese chestnut is being discriminated\r\nagainst because of the poor quality of its nuts. Orchardists having\r\nmixed plantings containing Japanese chestnuts are advised to top work\r\nthe trees or remove them, if the seed is to be used for plantings. In\r\nfact, for orchard plantings, nuts should be used only from the best\r\nindividual trees of the Chinese chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese chestnut should be planted on sites with good air drainage\r\nas it is very susceptible to injury from early-fall or late-spring\r\nfreezes. Many persons think their trees have been killed by the blight\r\nwhen the primary cause of the trouble was injury to the trunk by\r\nfreezing followed by growth of the blight organism over the injured\r\nparts. This fungus may grow for many years in the outer layers of the\r\nbark without doing any material damage to the tree. An important factor\r\nin resistance of the Chinese chestnuts to the blight is to keep the\r\ntrees growing vigorously. Avoid late growth in the fall as this favors\r\nfall freezing damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--F1 hybrids between the Chinese chestnut and\r\nthe American chestnut.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nut Spoilage+\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States one of the most serious problems with some\r\nselections of the Chinese chestnut is the spoilage of the nuts. Marvin\r\nE. Fowler made a study of this trouble at Savannah, Ga., and found that\r\nmost of the trouble in that restricted area was caused by a\r\nGleoesporium-like fungus that infects the nuts at the tip.[10] Because\r\nspraying experiments did not give control, the more susceptible trees\r\nhave been removed. In most parts of the South, however, this fungus is\r\nnot the primary cause of nut spoilage and the limited work so far\r\ncarried out has not revealed the cause. Part of the trouble may be due\r\nto physiological break-down. As individual trees vary greatly in\r\nsusceptibility to this deterioration of the nuts, orchardists are\r\nadvised to top work or eliminate the more susceptible trees. Some people\r\nhave believed that exposure of the nuts to the hot sun while in the bur\r\nor on the ground may cause damage. The market for Chinese chestnuts can\r\nbe ruined by shipping nuts that are partly spoiled by the time they\r\nreach the consumer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Gravatt, G. F., and Marvin E. Fowler. Diseases of chestnut\r\ntrees and nuts. Northern Nut Growers Assoc. Rept. (1940) 31: 110-113.\r\n1941.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Phytophthora Root Disease of Chestnut+\r\n\r\nPhytophthora root disease, caused by _Phytophthora cinnamomi_, is\r\ntreated briefly here, and interested nut growers can consult the\r\ndetailed earlier article.[11] Briefly, this fungus is considered as\r\nintroduced into this country over a hundred years ago. It killed the\r\nchestnut and chinkapin growth over large areas in the southern States.\r\nAsiatic chestnuts are highly resistant to this disease, and when grown\r\non well-drained soils have not been damaged. Our test plantings of\r\nChinese chestnuts growing in the same soils where susceptible trees of\r\nAmerican and European chestnuts were killed, continue to make a vigorous\r\ngrowth. The European and American chestnuts and their hybrids growing in\r\nthe western States are in danger from this fungus as it has now been\r\nreported in the West. This same fungus sometimes kills thousands of\r\nyoung nursery trees of the black walnut, but these epidemics are usually\r\nbrought on by unusual weather conditions. Poor soil aeration, induced by\r\nexcessive rainfall and poor drainage, makes ideal conditions for damage\r\nto the walnut and other hosts by _Phytophthora_. Even the very resistant\r\nChinese chestnut roots are invaded by the fungus when the soil remains\r\nwaterlogged for extended periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Brooming Disease of Walnut+\r\n\r\nA systemic brooming disease, observed on planted walnuts as early as\r\n1917, has been the subject of considerable discussion during recent\r\nyears, because it has now spread widely into the native black walnut\r\ngrowth. In 1932 Waite published that he had been observing the disease\r\nfor some 15 years but that \"it was unknown on the black walnut in the\r\nwild in this country or on planted trees away from the Japanese walnut.\"\r\nThe disease has continued to increase in prevalence in recent years and\r\nis now widely distributed in native black walnut growth in Tennessee,\r\nVirginia, District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. This\r\nextensive spread into the native growth during the last 15 or 20 years\r\nand the fact that reports indicate that all of the early cases of the\r\ndisease were found near nursery-grown trees offer some evidence that the\r\ndisease is an importation from another area or continent into the\r\neastern black walnut zone. From the literature and oral reports, it\r\nseems that the disease is now present also in North Carolina, West\r\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and Michigan. Surveys probably\r\nwould uncover the disease among native wild and planted walnuts in other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Crandall, B. S., G. F. Gravatt, and M. M. Ryan. Root\r\ndiseases of Castanea species and some coniferous and broadleaf nursery\r\nstocks, caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Phytopathology 35: 162-180.\r\nIllus. 1945.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Economic Importance and Hosts+\r\n\r\nThe black walnut is a valuable native forest tree, widely but not\r\nabundantly distributed in the eastern United States. It is extensively\r\nplanted as a forest tree. The numerous plantings and natural stands\r\naround farm homes, along fences, and in pastures are also very valuable.\r\nMore and more grafted ornamentals, and orchards of black walnut are\r\nbeing planted. For these the per-tree investment is high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--The brooming disease of walnut. Severe\r\nbrooming on Japanese walnut.]\r\n\r\nThe ultimate effect of the brooming disease on the black walnut is not\r\nknown. Dr. Waite stated, \"Trees even moderately attacked soon become\r\nworthless for nut production.\" Some affected black walnut trees,\r\nhowever, continue to produce small crops of nuts. Visible symptoms have\r\nbeen known to disappear. In addition, some seedlings, and probably large\r\ntrees also, are infected without showing symptoms. Such observations\r\nindicate the complex nature of the disease. Detailed studies are needed,\r\nbut at present this Division is not in position to do more than limited,\r\npart-time work on the disease.\r\n\r\nThe butternut, a widely distributed forest tree of minor importance, is\r\nseriously injured or killed by this disease. The disease severely\r\ndamages or kills the Japanese walnut, which has been planted to a\r\nlimited extent but is of little importance. According to Dr. Waite's\r\nreport, the Persian, or English, walnut is attacked, but very few trees\r\nof this species are planted in the eastern States. Precautions should be\r\ntaken to prevent the introduction of this disease into areas where it is\r\nnot now present, particularly the western states.\r\n\r\nSymptoms expressed by infected trees are viruslike, and Hutchins and\r\nWester[12] were able to produce the brooming symptoms on a small number\r\nof trees by means of bark patch grafts, indicating that the brooming\r\ndisease probably is caused by a virus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Brooming disease on black walnut. Ascending\r\ntype, upright, sucker growth is typical of this species.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Description of Symptoms+\r\n\r\nThe entire range of symptoms of the brooming disease has not been\r\ndetermined. Symptoms are recognizable during mid-July but they are most\r\npronounced during September and October. Curling and cupping of\r\nleaflets, chlorosis, narrowing and basal tapering of leaflets appear to\r\nbe associated with early stages of the disease. On severely affected\r\ntrees there are distinct broomlike growths at branch terminals, along\r\nprimary or secondary branches, or on the main stem to the ground line\r\n(Fig. 2). The broomlike growths are formed by the continuing abnormal\r\ndevelopment of normally located buds into short, succulent branches.\r\nUpright, suckerlike branches appear on primary and secondary branches\r\nand on the main stem of the affected tree. (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThe broomed parts usually die back during the dormant period following\r\ntheir appearance. The dead brooms on trees that appear to be healthy\r\nduring the early months of the growing-season indicate that the trees\r\nare infected. Usually the diseased trees, even those severely affected,\r\nexhibit normal growth during the early summer months.\r\n\r\nEvidence that walnut trees may be infected for a considerable time prior\r\nto appearance of recognizable symptoms was obtained when 37 per cent of\r\na total of 300 severely pruned trees exhibited brooming disease\r\nsymptoms. These trees had looked healthy until they were pruned.\r\nUnpruned control trees showed a 4 per cent increase in disease during\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Hutchins, Lee M., and Horace V. Wester.\r\nGraft-transmissible brooming disease of walnut. Phytopathology. 37 (1):\r\n11. (Abstract) 1947.]\r\n\r\n+Summary+\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence that a virus disease is active among certain\r\nspecies of walnut in central and eastern United States. The disease\r\nexhibits distinctive symptoms and appears to damage infected trees,\r\nsometimes severely, over several growing seasons. Present data indicate\r\nthat recognizable symptoms of the disease may not appear for some time\r\nafter infection, unless the host is subjected to severe shock. Thus,\r\nnursery stock may be one means of spreading the disease into new areas.\r\nIt is recommended, without experimental work to back up the\r\nrecommendation, that walnut nurserymen remove infected trees in the\r\nvicinity of their nursery sites.\r\n\r\nInvestigation of this disease to the present time has been limited.\r\nGeneral observations indicate that severely broomed trees produce poor\r\nnut crops. Mortality caused by the disease appears to be quite low among\r\nblack walnut trees. Butternut and Japanese walnut trees are, in general,\r\nmore severely affected by the disease than the black walnut and many\r\nseem to be killed by it, although the killing process is slow. As a\r\nresult of experience with other virus diseases, orchardists who have\r\nonly a few infected trees among their black walnuts are advised to\r\nremove them. Whether the disease can be kept under control by repeated\r\nroguing is uncertain. If an owner has just a few trees of value as\r\nornamentals as well as nut producers, one hesitates to advise him to\r\nremove a lightly infected tree until more information is obtained\r\nconcerning the disease.\r\n\r\nThis Division will welcome information from persons having experience\r\nwith the brooming disease of walnut, as it is in a position to do only a\r\nlimited amount of work on the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Persimmon Wilt+\r\n\r\nPersimmon wilt is very destructive to the native persimmon (Fig. 4). It\r\nis caused by the fungus _Cephalosporium diospyri_, which was described\r\nin 1945 by Bowen S. Crandall[13]. The fungus grows in the wood of the\r\ntrees, producing discolored streaks. Most trees are rapidly killed,\r\nwith yellow, wilted leaves making quite a contrast to the normal green\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThis disease was found in spots from central Tennessee south to the\r\nGulf, east into Florida, and up the coast into North Carolina. The\r\nAmerican persimmon seemed to be in danger, as this quickly killing\r\ndisease appeared to be spreading. The limited work on this disease was\r\ndiscontinued because of the war and the transfer of Mr. Crandall to\r\nPeru. However, this summer Mr. Crandall and the senior writer spent two\r\nweeks surveying some of the old infections and nearby territory, and\r\nwere pleased to note that the disease had made very little progress into\r\nnew territory. On several small areas where the disease was present some\r\nsix years ago practically all of the larger trees had been killed, but\r\nsome new small trees were coming up. At Chattanooga National Park, where\r\nthe wilt was rampant about six years ago, it is continuing to kill\r\ntrees, but many new ones are coming up. No northward extension of the\r\ndisease in Tennessee or North Carolina was noted in the limited time\r\nspent in inspection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Small persimmon trees killed by the wilt.]\r\n\r\nWhat does the disease mean to the grower of grafted persimmons, both\r\nnative and Oriental? The Japanese or Chinese persimmons do not grow as\r\nwell on their own roots, although they are quite safe that way as these\r\ntwo species are very resistant to the wilt. In the East, most of the\r\nOriental persimmons are grafted on American root stocks, and trees in\r\none case were killed by the wilt fungus getting in on the susceptible\r\nroot stock. No attempts to control the wilt have been made, and these\r\nrecommendations are based on procedure with other diseases and on\r\nknowledge of the spore production of this fungus. An owner of a valuable\r\nplanting of grafted trees in a region where the disease is present\r\nshould watch his trees for the first indication of trouble. The planting\r\nwill be safer, if there are no nearby native trees; and if native trees\r\nare growing nearby and cannot be removed, they should be given a general\r\ninspection. Prompt removal and burning of any infected trees found is\r\nadvisable. The fact that usually fungus spore production does not take\r\nplace until after the tree has been dead for a while makes the prospect\r\nfor control better than with most diseases. Care should be taken not to\r\nbring in scions or trees from infected areas.\r\n\r\nMost members of the Northern Nut Growers Association have only a few\r\ngrafted persimmon trees, usually located outside of the infected zone\r\nand therefore in little danger. Persimmon scions and trees should not be\r\nshipped from infected to healthy regions. The disease has not been\r\nreported in nurseries, but it could occur there because it attacks small\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Crandall, Bowen S. A new species of +Cephalosporium+ causing\r\npersimmon wilt. Mycologia 37 (4): 495-498. 1945.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Thyronectria Disease of Honeylocust+\r\n\r\nHoneylocust is widely distributed both in native stands and in\r\nplantations. Some farmers plant this species or leave native trees in\r\ntheir pastures for the pods, which have a high sugar content, up to 38\r\nper cent. J. C. Moore, of the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nreported preliminary tests indicating a per-acre yield of livestock feed\r\nequal to that of oats.\r\n\r\nIn many areas the growth of honeylocust is seriously affected by a\r\ncanker and twig fungus, _Thyronectria austro-americana_. The disease\r\noften kills many twigs and branches and sometimes results in death of\r\nthe tree. In most areas it causes only slight injury. Bowen S. Crandall\r\nand Jesse D. Diller have made a few observations on the prevalence and\r\ndamage by this disease, which is present from New England south into the\r\nGulf States and west into the Great Plains States.\r\n\r\nThe fungus causing this disease is morphologically somewhat similar to\r\nthe chestnut blight fungus, having two spore stages produced in\r\nreddish-brown pinhead-size fruiting bodies on the bark. Cankers are\r\nproduced on the smaller branches, but they usually are not noted until\r\nsome of the affected ones wilt and die. In the exposed outer wood of a\r\nbranch cut above or below the canker there are reddish-brown streaks\r\nseveral inches long, indicating that the fungus has grown in the\r\nvascular system.\r\n\r\nAs no control experiments are known, recommendations are based on\r\ngeneral knowledge of sanitation. If an owner has only a few valuable\r\nplanted trees, he should cut off the diseased parts a foot or more back\r\nfrom the lower edge of the affected bark and burn or bury them in the\r\nsoil. If he has many trees scattered over extensive pasture areas, it is\r\nquestionable whether any action other than elimination of the more\r\nsusceptible trees is justified. We will be interested in the results\r\nobtained from control work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Now I will turn over the chairmanship of the meeting\r\nto Mr. Chase, who will have charge of the Round Table Discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRound Table Discussion on Chestnut Problems\r\n\r\nSPENCER B. CHASE, Presiding\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panel of Experts_: Max E. Hardy, Carroll D. Bush, H. F. Stoke, G. F.\r\nGravatt, J. C. McDaniel.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Gentlemen, in the last hour and a half we have heard perhaps\r\nmore about chestnuts from qualified specialists than we will ever hear\r\nin any meeting of ours, and we requested each one to withhold questions\r\nuntil this point. So now we will have some questions from the floor,\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: What is the present status of breeding chestnut species for\r\ntimber purposes?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: The prospects are coming along. We have one cross between a\r\nnone-too-promising Chinese chestnut and an American chestnut, with a\r\ngood bunch of hybrids and they are different from other hybrids. It\r\nlooks like they will stand up against blight. They will have blight\r\ncanker growth from 10 feet down to the ground but it doesn't go into the\r\ncambium region. It is too early to evaluate the hybrids, but they do\r\nhave the upright form and rapid growth of the American chestnut.\r\n\r\nNow when we take these first-generation hybrids, cross them back with\r\nthe Chinese and get more resistance, as we have done so many times in\r\nthe past, we lose that rapid and more upright growth habit of the\r\nAmerican chestnut. But we have a lot more work to do before we are ready\r\nto say anything final on this question.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur H. Graves, formerly at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is now\r\nconsulting pathologist at the New Haven, (Conn.) Experiment Station. We\r\nhave been working with him and partially supporting his chestnut\r\nbreeding for a good many years. He has a lot of hybrids up there. We\r\nexpect to have something later, but have nothing to release yet.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do you have any sprays to control diseases and insect pests in\r\nthe tree that when they go into the soil won't destroy our ground\r\nfriends?\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Gravatt?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I don't know what insects you are after, in the first\r\nplace. We have a lot of trouble with Japanese beetles. Around\r\nWashington, Dr. Crane's and my plantings there would be defoliated if\r\nthey weren't sprayed for Japanese beetle control, and it is the same way\r\nwith filberts.\r\n\r\nA Member: The same sprays have a tendency to work against most of the\r\npests, do they not? Of course, DDT will take one, the arsenate of lead\r\ntakes another, Black Leaf 40 another, but if we had a spray that we can\r\nuse around on--well, not limited to the chestnut--that would be\r\nneutralized in the earth. Now, we have a good deal of friendly bacteria\r\nand insects in the soil that we want to keep.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I would say that I am a pathologist, and insect work is out\r\nof my line.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Does anyone else have a comment on that? Dr. Cross, did you\r\nhear the question?\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: I didn't get his question.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Would you stand and repeat your question?\r\n\r\nA Member: Is there a spray that we can use for combating the insect\r\npests of our trees that when it is washed off and goes into the soil\r\ndoesn't kill our soil friends. We have the friendly bacteria in the\r\nsoil, as well as insect and worm life. Do we have a spray that will be\r\nneutralized as it hits the soil so we can spray the tree and not kill\r\nour lower friends?\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: Sorry, Mr. Chase, that's beyond me.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: You are thinking of arsenate of lead poisoning the soil\r\nwhere you keep on spraying with it?\r\n\r\nA Member: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: I think DDT may build up a little in the soil, but it is\r\nbroken down, isn't it, Dr. Crane?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Yes, DDT is broken down and it is not a fungicide and it is\r\nnot a bactericide. It is an insecticide that kills insects through\r\naffecting the nervous system, according to my understanding of it. I am\r\nnot an entomologist, but that's what the entomologists say. So far we\r\nhaven't any evidence to my knowledge of any build-up of DDT in soils\r\nthat has been detrimental. I don't know what the situation would be if\r\nDDT was used to the same extent as arsenate of lead. It was not uncommon\r\nfor some growers to put on anywhere from 6 to 15 lead sprays in a season\r\nin order to control codling moth, as they used to do in certain apple\r\norchards, particularly in the West.\r\n\r\nI was talking to Dr. Van Leeuwen just a day or two before I had to leave\r\nfor the meeting, and he is not ready yet to say anything about it, but\r\nhe has already tested some very promising insecticides as far as the\r\ncontrol of weevil is concerned. This DDT and some of the other new\r\ninsecticides are very easily decomposed, and, of course, that's one of\r\nthe disadvantages of them. Under certain climatic conditions they would\r\nneed to be less readily decomposed to give control over a longer period.\r\nI know that we have not had enough experience to know all about those\r\nnew spray materials.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: There has been one instance reported where DDT _in the\r\nsoil_ was injurious to fruit plant growth. That was Goldsworthy's and\r\nDunegan's work on strawberries. Where they used large amounts of\r\ntechnical DDT in the soil, they found that it inhibited the growth of\r\nthe strawberry plant. I believe that's the only instance I've heard of,\r\nwhere soil application of DDT hurt growth of fruit plants. Benzene\r\nhexachloride, and some other chlorinated hydrocarbons, and parathion\r\nactually appeared to have a stimulating effect on the berry plants.[14]\r\n\r\nMr. Frye: Why would there be any more danger of affecting the soil in a\r\nchestnut orchard than there would in the apple and peach orchard by\r\nspraying seven, eight and ten times? That's the only question that\r\narises with me.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Let's get back to chestnuts specifically, now, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Kays (Oklahoma A. & M. College): Since I don't come from a chestnut\r\narea, my impression of the nut samples supplied by Mr. Moore of Auburn,\r\nwas: \"I'd like them if they had salted them.\" I am wondering if it\r\nwouldn't have affected their rancidity if they had been treated--salting\r\nmaterial added, prior to or in the process somewhere along the line.\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Moore: I'd just like to say I have tried putting salt in the\r\nwater, to boil the nuts with salt, and then I have tried shelling them\r\nand sprinkling salt, and I find that salt does not add anything to the\r\nflavor. Tasting the nuts raw, I, too, get the impression salt is what I\r\nwant, but I haven't been able to add it satisfactorily. I don't say that\r\nit cannot be done.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Mr. Chairman, in view of the whole situation of chestnut\r\nincompatibility of stock with scion, what would be the position that we\r\nin the Northern Nut Growers Association can take in advising people what\r\nkind of chestnuts they should plant? Should they be encouraged to try to\r\nget grafted trees? What should be our position?\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Stoke, would you care to comment on that?\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: You are asking me to stick out my neck, and it seems as if I\r\nhave always done that. The Chinese chestnut is in the Johnny Appleseed\r\nstage, in my opinion, and we are investigating to find out the best\r\nvarieties, that is, the best specimen, best performance, best quality,\r\nbest in blight resistance, growth, and other qualities and when we\r\nwinnow out all we have and arrive at the best, we are going to\r\nfind--now, this is just my personal opinion--I will say that for myself\r\nI'd rather have one acre of the best selections we have budded or\r\ngrafted--asexually propagated, than five acres of seedling trees as a\r\nfinancial good bet, because I say that one acre of our very best produce\r\nvirtually as many nuts as five acres of seedlings. I have trees from\r\nseed I imported through the Yokahama Nursery Company, and I think it\r\ncame from Korea. The nuts run very small, and compared with those I am\r\nsure the others will pay much better, and I think it would be profitable\r\nto pay three or four or five times as much for your trees if you get\r\ngood trees of good, known varieties and grafted or budded.\r\n\r\nDon't misunderstand me. We shouldn't ask the American public to wait\r\nuntil those can be furnished, because they won't wait, and they\r\nshouldn't. But I say as a commercial proposition, to plant trees\r\ncommercially, I would exercise caution and I would encourage my\r\ncustomers to exercise caution unless they are willing to follow up and\r\ndo their own top working later on, and a Chinese chestnut doesn't top\r\nwork as readily as a black walnut.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I don't believe that's quite the answer he wanted. The\r\ncomment that I think Dr. MacDaniels is after is what position should the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association take in regard to planting seedlings or\r\nplanting grafted stock. Is that the point?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Yes, it seems to be seedlings against grafted stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: May I answer? I don't think the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation should take _any_ position. They should present the facts\r\nand let the buyer decide. I don't think we need to go on record, and I\r\ndon't think we should. There is too much diversity of opinion.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Between ourselves--and this is not an academic\r\nquestion--we get continual inquiries regarding the Chinese chestnuts and\r\nwhat should they plant and where can they get the trees, and so forth.\r\nIt isn't good enough in most of these cases to write several pages\r\nexplaining what the whole situation is, the _if's_, _and's_, and\r\n_but's_. But I just wonder what the opinion is of the people who know\r\nbest in this regard. Who has a good orchard of 20-year-old grafted\r\nChinese chestnuts? Where are they? I don't know: I am asking for\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Dr. Drain, are those trees you have grafted trees or seedling\r\ntrees?\r\n\r\nDr. Drain (University of Tennessee): They are seedling trees. They have\r\nproduced a rather nice quality nut, and we have enjoyed propagating\r\nseedlings from them. That's really all we know. We haven't grafted any.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mac, would you care to comment on this?\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: I am ashamed to say that at present we have no grafted\r\nchestnut trees on my own north Alabama farms. We have about 50 trees\r\nthat are 8-year-old seedlings from imported (Chinese) nuts, growing next\r\nto a commercial peach block, and find the production quite variable on\r\nthe different trees. I am aiming at top-working most of these with the\r\nnamed varieties, beginning this year. At present I can't answer the\r\nquestion of seedlings vs grafted trees. I have been advising people who\r\nare interested in trying them in Tennessee that _for their first\r\nplanting_ (to test the adaptability of their locations) they can get the\r\nseedlings generally quite a bit cheaper than the grafted trees. With the\r\nexperience we have had over the State and the high mortality of trees,\r\nboth grafted and seedling--killing of the tops and in some cases the\r\nwhole tree--the seedling might be best economically _to begin their_\r\nexperimenting with. I am _not recommending_ that anyone plant seedlings\r\ncommercially, but just in a small way for trial. They are well worth a\r\ntrial anywhere peaches are doing well. When we find a _suitable site_,\r\nthen is the time to think about using the more expensive grafted trees.\r\n\r\nPres. Davidson: I just want to give a little bit of my experience along\r\nthat line. Way back in 1934 I planted a few seeds that I got from Amelia\r\nRiehl. They were nuts of the Riehl hybrids. [Ed. note: Mostly\r\nAmerican--European crosses.] She named one Dan Patch and another\r\nGibbons. They are now about 13 years old. Each of them is bearing burs\r\nthis year. They have borne burs, a few of them, in the past, but no\r\nnuts. So far in 1948, the burs that have fallen to the ground, of\r\ncourse, have no nuts, but whether the burs that are still on the trees\r\nhave nuts I don't know. I want to know whether those trees are\r\nnormal---whether a hybrid of that kind is likely to be sterile or not.\r\nThat's another matter that might be discussed. Anyhow, you are taking a\r\nchance, no question about that, when you plant seedlings.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Mr. Chairman, if you will pardon me for saying one more word,\r\nhere is a suggestion I will make. Now you can check for yourself. The\r\nwhole thing hinges on whether we can get _permanent_ grafts on the tree\r\nand get the characteristics in the grafted tree that the parent has--in\r\nthe good selected tree. Now you take the reports sent us by Mr. Hemming;\r\nyou take the reports of the station at Albany--of individual trees in\r\nthose plots. You take the worst trees and you will find they are nothing\r\nbut boarders. You take the best and you will find they are very\r\nprofitable. You take the average and it will fall somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nNow, why keep a lot of boarders that don't pay--free boarders--or why\r\nuse run-of-mine seedlings, _if_ we can graft successfully--and some\r\npeople like to dispute that--and produce nothing but the best? And you\r\ncan check it on any of those tables. [Mr. Hardy's paper.] We have a few\r\ntables in our former Reports. You can check it and figure it out for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: To clear up this situation I wanted to ask Mr. Hardy a\r\nquestion, and then I wanted to make a statement. In this report from the\r\n1938 and 1940 planting at Albany, Georgia, in the Brown tract in 1947\r\nthere were 188 trees that bore crops, but that planting consisted of\r\n274 trees planted in 1938 and 60 trees planted in 1940. Why weren't\r\nthose 274 trees plus those 60 trees represented in the 100 with the\r\nyield records of 1947?\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: Dr. Crane knows the answer, so I will let him ask the\r\nquestion and answer it, too.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: In 1936 we planted 1,000 trees of the same Peter Liu\r\nselections on the Station farm at Beltsville, Maryland. They were of the\r\nsame number and letter designations as others that were distributed to\r\ncooperators. Out of the thousand trees that we planted on the Station\r\nfarm some of them came into bearing at four and five years after\r\nplanting. But the nuts were small in size and were not much good. With\r\none or two exceptions, out of that planting there were none bearing\r\nsatisfactorily to suit us after ten years. In 1945 we applied the ax,\r\nbecause a Chinese chestnut tree, from an orchard standpoint, if it's not\r\nin bearing in ten years after planting is not worth keeping. We haven't\r\ngot time to wait. So out they came. And in addition to that we have had\r\nother trees that have done the same thing.\r\n\r\nNow, out of this 274 plus the 60 at Albany, Georgia, we have three trees\r\nthat we now figure are good enough to be raised to a variety status,\r\nplus possibly two or three more. Now, you can figure your percentage of\r\ngood trees when you plant seeds.\r\n\r\nDr. Overholser: Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question, whether these three\r\nseedlings to which they propose to give variety status have been\r\npropagated in sufficient number that they are able to give distribution\r\nin other areas.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: Dr. Overholser, they are not available yet in quantity. That\r\nsame answer is part of the answer I wanted to make to Dr. MacDaniels.\r\nThe present situation in the chestnut industry is that there are very\r\nfew nurserymen who know how to propagate nursery grafted trees\r\nsuccessfully. There is going to have to be quite a bit of work done on\r\nthat. If some of you here know how to do it, I would like to know,\r\nmyself. There are a lot of nurserymen who would like to know, according\r\nto the reports I have, how to graft or bud a nursery chestnut tree.\r\n\r\nAs long as the situation is that way I would say to recommend seedling\r\ntrees because of their low price, but--and every grower who has trees\r\ncan fall in line with this--the seeds should be from properly culled-out\r\norchards of the highest type, leaving nothing in there producing nuts or\r\npollen but what is the highest type. I think all of you who have more\r\nthan one type of chestnut in your plantings should cull them all down to\r\nthe pure _Castanea mollissima_. I don't mean by cutting out the whole\r\ntree, but go ahead and top-work them. If they won't take the top, _then_\r\ncut them out. But if you can top-work them and the grafting is good, you\r\ncan increase your planting of good trees in that manner.\r\n\r\nThe improved quality of the seed will improve the quality of seedlings\r\ngoing to the buyer, and the chances of a higher percentage of good\r\nseedlings showing up will be greater. I think it will improve the\r\nindustry through a period of years.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think I agree with his position. In fact, that's\r\nexactly what we are telling the inquiries that come in: At the present\r\nstate of our knowledge, better try seedling trees.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't hear anybody get up and say they had an orchard of\r\n20-year-old grafted chestnut trees. I have tried to get them, I have\r\ngrafted successfully, I suppose, 7 or 8 different varieties on many\r\ndifferent Chinese stocks that I have bought, or had given to me, and\r\nnumbers of grafted trees. I have nothing left. They grow fine, 7 or 8\r\nfeet the first year, 3 or 4 feet the next year, then they go along for a\r\nwhile and then they die. In other words, there is an unsolved problem\r\nthere, so that it seems to me at the present state of our knowledge we\r\nhad better admit it and say, \"If you are an amateur, you better get the\r\nbest seedling trees that you can and wait awhile.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. C. Moore: I just want to give some data on some of the class work\r\nat Auburn with Chinese chestnuts. We were studying Chinese seedlings,\r\nand we attempted to bud those Chinese chestnut seedlings, and on some of\r\nthe larger seedlings we top-worked. We had some 3-year-old seedlings,\r\nand we top-worked the limbs. We put in patch buds, and we put in T-buds\r\nor shield buds, and in practically every case on some of the trees the\r\nbuds stuck beautifully.\r\n\r\nIn June and again in August, with another class, we had the same\r\nresults, either with T-bud or shield bud or patch bud. Some of the\r\nseedlings wouldn't take the buds at all. I can't think why one seedling\r\nwould take 100 per cent of the buds and another seedling growing right\r\nby it wouldn't take any buds.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: The oldsters here will remember Colonel C. K. Sober, one of\r\nour former members who propagated what he later named the Sober's\r\nParagon chestnut. It was a grafted tree and apparently it was grafted\r\nsuccessfully on native stocks, and it grew until the blight got it.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I am not talking about European or American, I am\r\ntalking about Chinese chestnuts.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Rourke: It may affect the nursery industry. The nurserymen are\r\nlooking to the Northern Nut Growers Association, Federal bureaus and\r\nState experiment stations to guide them in the propagation of desirable\r\ntrees. We know now that the Chinese chestnut is becoming quite\r\nprominent, is becoming quite popular in many sections of the country,\r\nand many nurserymen are now getting requests to supply the public in\r\ntheir states with Chinese chestnuts. They, in turn, would like to know\r\nwhat they should do. If they sell Chinese chestnut trees which have been\r\npropagated vegetatively and they only grow five, eight, 10 or 15 years\r\nand then die, it's going to come back on the nurserymen. They should\r\nlike to know whether they should do that or whether they should rely\r\nupon seedlings which they can develop into pure lines as best they may.\r\n\r\nNow, that really is a serious question. I am wondering from what Mr.\r\nHardy has told us today if it may not be an understock problem, and if\r\nit is an understock problem--if there are certain strains of understock\r\nwhich are compatible with certain scions, possibly we should ask for\r\nsome investigations, some more research to be done in this direction.\r\n\r\nThen possibly, on the other hand, we should also ask that certain\r\ninvestigations be carried out so that we will have some idea of the\r\ninheritable characters that may be \"fixed\" through seed selection. I\r\nreally think that this seed selection should be very seriously\r\nconsidered, and that nurserymen in particular and the public in general\r\nwould benefit greatly by such consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: Mr. Chase, may I make this suggestion: I think it is\r\nsomething that a number of individuals could try, perhaps they should be\r\nbacked up by agricultural institutions, either Federal or State. We are\r\nall interested and concerned with stocks, and I think a large part of\r\nour trouble with grafting chestnuts is a stock-scion relationship.\r\n\r\nWe have some top-worked trees 13 years old that are just as healthy,\r\njust as normal as they can be. We have some top-worked trees of various\r\nages below that. The graft-union is good; they are just as healthy and\r\ncontinue to be as productive and vigorous as the parent tree. Where\r\nthere is incompatibility we run into difficulties very shortly. To a\r\nlarge extent I think we are involved with two problems in the trouble\r\nwith incompatibility, or perhaps I should say the dying, of grafted\r\ntrees. One is a stock-scion relationship, the other a mechanical\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nI think there are these two types of incompatibilities. Now, as to the\r\nmechanical part--that can be improved through developing the art of\r\ngrafting or budding, whichever works out best. The other will require\r\nquite a lot of study, perhaps the development of certain strains of the\r\nroot stocks for certain scion varieties.\r\n\r\nI have made this suggestion to two or three. I have started the work\r\nmyself by putting out with friends two or three or four trees. After\r\nthey get up to a size where I can top-work them, I will top-work with\r\ntwo varieties. Perhaps I will put Nanking and Kuling on two trees at one\r\nparticular place. Two or three miles away I will put Kuling and Meiling\r\non two others. At another place I will put Nanking and Meiling. I will\r\nget reciprocal pollination, because the chestnut is necessarily\r\ncross-pollinating.[15] I can then plant seedlings from both parents,\r\neach pollinated by the other. Then by grafting those varieties onto\r\nthose seedlings stocks I can find out whether there is any reason to go\r\ninto the work of developing seed orchards of two varieties whereby\r\nMeiling pollinated by Kuling may produce the best, most vigorous, most\r\nuniform seedlings on which Kuling can be propagated. And by propagating\r\nKuling on such seedlings--the seedlings of such inheritance--we may get\r\n100 per cent of good grafts.\r\n\r\nThe industry needs a lot of help, and I think it is a matter of time\r\nuntil those things are worked out, but it is going to take time and\r\nmoney and plenty of good effort to work out that problem. I think it\r\nprobably should be worked out.\r\n\r\nMr. Bush: I don't like the word \"incompatibility\", and I hardly believe\r\nin it, and I presume most of you know that. I have Chinese on European\r\nstock, and it has been there for 20 years or more, _grafted high_. I\r\nhave Chinese on Japanese grafted _under the ground_. I think a good deal\r\nof our damage is done from wind, from cold, and from sun on the graft\r\n_just above the ground_. I suspect that grafting at that point is what\r\nis the matter with many trees in the TVA plantings and others that had\r\nlow survival. Of late years when I did the grafting (in the last five or\r\nsix years) I cut the stock underneath the ground and stuck the graft\r\nunder the ground and seemingly I got far better results. Some of those\r\ngraft failures showed up. I laid that largely to mechanical damage, and\r\nagain with the Japanese, particularly, I laid it on the time when the\r\nsap comes up. Call it what you will, but the timing of the growth of the\r\ntwo trees is different and we had trouble there. I have grafted some\r\nvery widely different kinds of chestnuts on the tops of other chestnuts,\r\nand am getting them to grow. When we see the break start, we take a twig\r\nfrom below and break and put it above, cut through the cambium and nail\r\nit on and they will heal over and the defect disappears. So, again, it\r\nseems to be mechanical.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: I believe from observations on a number of trees,\r\nparticularly Dr. Richards' in West Tennessee, that a large part of our\r\nso-called incompatibility in this State is due to winter injury _to the\r\nstock_. So what Dr. Richards meant, evidently, was that he was rather\r\nsuccessful in getting a \"take\" from last summer's propagation but the\r\nstock then failed below the union this spring. I saw his trees, and they\r\nhad the typical discoloration of bark and the dying of various bark\r\nareas--these girdling the whole tree in a number of instances. [See\r\nRichards' paper in this report.] I would agree in general with what Mr.\r\nBush has just said, but there are certain other instances in which we\r\nthink the only word for what we see is \"incompatibility.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: What are the prospects of planting those low-grafted trees\r\nrather deep?\r\n\r\nMr. Bush: I think that if the roots started to die the grafted tree\r\nwould start a root above the graft. The sap is going up from the root.\r\nIt will go down and the root will start above the graft and go out above\r\nthe graft, thus getting the tree on its own root.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Since we got onto grafting, do you mind if I say a word? Here\r\nis a four-branch, top-worked specimen that I chopped off and brought\r\nwith me. This first tree limb was still alive and had nuts on it, the\r\nsecond was dying and a third dead. This fourth union was still alive,\r\nbut it was badly damaged, too. That's Illinois 31 -4 on Japanese. Here\r\nis another graft of Illinois 31 -4 on Japanese in a small tree, and if\r\nthat's poor union, I am no grafter!\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: Mr. Stoke, may I ask you this: Is this [small graft] on the\r\nsame tree as this? [Indicating larger tree first referred to.]\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: No. Those four grafts, you see, all went bad. This one is in\r\nperfect condition. But I am having a hard time keeping that Illinois 31\r\n-4 alive. I had a union on _mollissima_ three inches in diameter and as\r\nperfect as this, two years ago. Last year it began to bulge at the point\r\nof union. The top wasn't feeding back to the root, and this year it is\r\nin bad condition,--foliage very small and it put on a very full crop of\r\nburs which will never mature, and it's going to pass out. It is about\r\nfour inches in diameter now.\r\n\r\nLast year to try to beat this thing I cut out the crown of a small\r\n_mollissima_ at the below-ground level and put in several grafts of this\r\nsame Illinois 31 -4, and I got a nice growth, at least four feet high.\r\nWhen I dug it up to transplant it--it was right in my garden--I found I\r\nhad a large callus more than an inch and a half in diameter at the union\r\nbut no roots. I reset it, and I haven't ventured to see whether it was\r\nall right or not. This spring I tried again.\r\n\r\nI have four little trees, one as high as my head, the others smaller. I\r\ngrafted each one on branch roots just as they lay in the ground. Didn't\r\ndig them up and they grew nicely, and along in July I went around and\r\nspaded them deeply and thought perhaps that would produce roots. About a\r\nweek ago I examined one. I have a magnificent callus but no roots yet\r\nabove the union. What the ultimate results will be I don't know.\r\n\r\nWith that particular hybrid I want to try one more thing. I want to grow\r\nseedlings of the European chestnut, cut them below the ground, graft\r\nIllinois 31 -4 on the root and it may make a union that will not fail,\r\nbecause the European is a very robust grower, and by being grafted under\r\nthe ground the stock will be away from blight organisms.\r\n\r\n[Editor's Note: Mr. C. A. Reed is naming this variety (Ill. 31-4)\r\n\"Colby\" in honor of the originator, Dr. Arthur S. Colby.]\r\n\r\nMr. Hirschi: I would like to say I put on hybrids similar to that\r\nIllinois 31 -4 and they grew the first year, and just made a bulky knot\r\nright at the point of union and died the second year.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: What was that combination?\r\n\r\nMr. Hirschi: That was _mollissima_ stock.\r\n\r\nNow, speaking about the varieties--this is in Oklahoma--I have tried\r\npractically all the older varieties and I have tried some Abundance\r\ngrafts this last year. I have some Abundance grafts that are two years\r\nold that are producing. They have the most vigorous growth of anything,\r\nand in our climate we have to have vigor.\r\n\r\nI grafted a lot of the Abundance scions on Hobson seedlings. I started\r\nout to grow an orchard from Hobson seedlings, and I found out that out\r\nof 50 splice grafts of Abundance that I put in Hobson seedlings in 1948,\r\nforty-eight grew, and they were put on rather late, in April. That's a\r\nlittle late for us. I have the idea--I don't know whether I am right or\r\nnot--that if the Abundance proves out as our best variety, we can grow\r\nseed for stock of the Abundance and then graft the Abundance back on the\r\nseedling from Abundance. If there is so much to this incompatibility, I\r\nshould overcome it by doing that very thing.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it is a crime that thousands of trees--almost\r\nmillions--are being put out by nurserymen as seedling trees, and if you\r\nwill note in their price lists they have \"6 to 12 inches\" and \"12 to 18\r\ninches\", \"2 to 3 feet\" and \"3 to 4 feet.\" I venture to say that those\r\nare probably all the same age. How would you like to plant some of those\r\n12-inch trees? Somebody is going to get hurt!\r\n\r\nMr. Bush: I'd like to say that you can propagate the Chinese chestnut by\r\nlayering if you want to, and that will put it on its own. Put a wedge on\r\nit or girdle it and keep it damp through the summer.\r\n\r\nPres. Davidson: I think Dr. MacDaniels' question is still not answered.\r\nI do think that if a nurseryman sells a seedling he ought to definitely\r\n_say that it is a seedling_ and not merely that it is a\r\n\"blight-resistant chestnut,\" or something of that sort. He should\r\nactually tell the public what he is selling.\r\n\r\nNow, then, there seem to be reasons why in some instances a man is\r\njustified in planting seedlings when it comes to Chinese chestnuts, but\r\nwhen it comes to the black walnut or filbert or some of these other\r\nthings, they are still selling seedlings without labelling them as such.\r\nI think we should be on record against that practice, because it takes\r\nus five or six years, or ten years sometimes, to find out that we have\r\nbeen gypped, and it is so easy to gyp the public when you can't find out\r\nabout it any sooner than that.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Rourke: I quite agree with Mr. Davidson that the nurserymen should\r\nstate that a seedling is a seedling when it is a seedling. And I am sure\r\nMr. Hirschi will corroborate that the American Association of Nurserymen\r\nis exerting all the influence they can to that end. Is that right, Mr.\r\nHirschi?\r\n\r\nMr. Hirschi: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Bregger: I would like to ask, if planters for some years yet will\r\nhave to rely on seedlings, is there a chance that from certain parents\r\nor certain varieties we can get a larger percentage of good seedlings\r\nthan from others? How much has it been studied and is there a known\r\nresult from the parent trees in the percent of what their seedlings can\r\ndo?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I wish I could answer that one. It is a matter of time, to\r\nfind out the seedling characteristics reproduced by a certain\r\ndescendant. But we know that there is a difference in _uniformity_ of\r\ntrees in the way they grow, but as far as bearing is concerned, and the\r\ntype of nut produced, we haven't had enough time yet.\r\n\r\nIt's just like this: We have made selections for rootstocks in which we\r\nhave selected trees that were good, strong and vigorous--the most\r\nvigorously growing trees that we have known about, and yet at the same\r\ntime produced a small nut or medium-sized nut that we could use for the\r\nproduction of rootstocks. And we have made progress on that, and we have\r\ndemonstrated that there is a very marked difference between the\r\ngraftability or budability of seedlings from certain parent trees. We\r\nhave demonstrated that some varieties are much easier to propagate than\r\nare others. But as for the proper combinations of stock and scion, we\r\nstill haven't got enough data to recommend any. We know that there are\r\ndifferences, but it is going to take quite a long while, at least four\r\nor five years or more, before we know.\r\n\r\nNow, there is just one other thing that comes up on propagation. We have\r\nfound that if you bench-graft and make the graft into the transition\r\nzone between root and top just like the old method that the apple\r\npropagator used when he piece-root grafted and then plant deep, you can\r\nget a hundred per cent of the grafts to grow. In such cases the scion\r\nmay root and the top will be on its own roots.\r\n\r\nWell, there are a lot of these tricks to learn as time goes on. I don't\r\nthink that we should worry too much about this graft union problem. We\r\nknow that this Carr variety is a bear-cat. It is the one that gave us so\r\nmuch trouble. When we tried to propagate that one we had a real, nasty\r\ncat by the tail. But on the other hand, in answer to Dr. MacDaniels'\r\nquestion if we go out to Dr. J. Russell Smith's plantings up at Round\r\nHill (Virginia), we can see a lot of the oldest grafted trees that I\r\nknow of anywhere in the country, and the unions are just as smooth and\r\njust as slick as anyone would want to see. They are not 20 years old; I\r\ndon't think there was ever a _mollissima_ chestnut grafted 20 years ago.\r\nThe first grafting that I know of was about 15 years ago, maybe 18.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: In 1932.\r\n\r\nMr. R. C. Moore: Thomas Jefferson grafted European chestnuts.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: No, I am talking about Chinese chestnuts. We didn't get in\r\nany Chinese chestnuts until 1906. We have this problem of\r\nincompatibility or graft union trouble, in apples, but do you hear\r\nanybody hollering about it? We have it in peaches, plums and cherries.\r\nOne of the most important diseases they have out in the Pacific\r\nNorthwest and California on Persian walnuts, is what is called \"black\r\nline disease.\" We mustn't get excited about graft union failure. That\r\nhas been used, in my opinion, by a lot of people, to discourage the\r\npropagating of grafted chestnuts. There are thousands of people in the\r\nUnited States who are spending good money for seedling trees, and some\r\nof them are going to get stung. We in the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation are going to have this thing backfire on us, just as true as\r\nI tell you. I know there are some nurserymen today that are planting\r\nunknown chestnut seeds, and they are selling the trees as Chinese\r\nchestnut. They are planting seed out of mixed orchards, too, that have\r\n_C. seguinii_ and _C. henryi_ and _C. crenata_ trees in them. The _C.\r\ncrenata_ Japanese has been introduced in the United States for over 70\r\nyears and it has never made the grade.\r\n\r\nYou know, there has been many a thing that has been promoted in the\r\nUnited States--big for a few days and then she backfired, and then it\r\ntook the industry 50 or a hundred years to recover. You can sell people\r\ngold bricks once, but you can't sell them gold bricks _all_ the time!\r\n\r\nMr. McCollum: Last year after Mr. Hemming's speech--you know, he is the\r\nnurseryman who sells seedlings over on the Eastern Shore--I asked him if\r\nhe had been selling those long enough to have heard from customers.\r\n\"Yes,\" he said he had, \"all satisfied.\" Now, I don't know anything about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nDr. Moss: I am not an expert. They say an expert is someone who, the\r\nmore he studies, knows less about practically nothing at all. That's a\r\ngood deal my shape. I planted before the war Chinese seed in Kentucky\r\nand a good many of those put on burs in the nursery row. I gave them\r\naway in the community. Out of the whole bunch, some of them 20 feet\r\ntall, I know of one outstanding nut in that bunch and it's off by\r\nitself, apparently a self-pollinizer[16], and puts out a crop of good\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: I should like to ask Dr. Crane if it would not be possible to\r\ninvestigate the situation in China rather than wait to work this out.\r\nCertainly, the Chinese have sufficient knowledge of grafting and\r\npropagation to have been working on this long ago, and since these came\r\nfrom there, let's look into that phase of it.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I did investigate the situation in China when I was there.\r\nUnfortunately in China, although it is one of our oldest countries and\r\nlongest civilizations, they don't do much grafting. They grow their\r\ntrees from seed, but they have certain seed trees that they select their\r\nseed from, and within a community, within a valley, you will have a\r\ncertain type of chestnut. They call them varieties. They are not\r\nvarieties. That's the situation. Most all of them are different, but\r\nthey have accomplished the fixing of certain characteristics.\r\n\r\nNow, in South China the nuts are larger in size, they are stronger\r\ngrowing trees than they are in the North. I think that we will find that\r\nthat's the situation in this country. The Chinese chestnut is one that\r\ndoes have a high heat requirement, just like pecan, and grown under\r\nconditions where they have high heat they are bigger in size and make\r\nmore growth and probably they come into bearing sooner.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't see anything grafted in China, and I was all over the\r\ncountry from the most northern parts to the most southern parts where\r\nchestnuts are produced. I could make a lot of observations myself, but I\r\nhad to talk through interpreters, and sometimes you couldn't tell what\r\nthe interpreter meant. But as near as I could tell, they were all\r\nseedlings. When he would tell me there was such-and-such a variety, I\r\nwould ask him what it meant in English. He didn't know. When I found\r\nhow they were propagated I found they planted the seed. When I found\r\nwhere they got the seed it was from a certain seed tree.\r\n\r\nSo we have within the valleys what they call varieties, but they are not\r\nvarieties, only seedlings grown from certain seed trees.\r\n\r\nNow, with the Japanese, on the other hand, the situation is different,\r\nbecause they propagated by budding and by grafting. I got a number of\r\nthe Japanese publications of propagation methods and their stocks, and\r\nso forth, translated into English, and their problems are just the same\r\nas we are going through right here now. They propagate true varieties by\r\nasexual methods, but the Chinese do not to any extent at all.\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: Have the Russians got any?\r\n\r\nA Member: That's the question I ask. Do we have any seed trees in this\r\ncountry that are better than other seed trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Porter: Could the gentleman tell us whether the Chinese graft _any_\r\nchestnuts.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Yes, they do so, I was told.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter: Well, the industry spends a lot of money, so do other\r\npeople, and so on, in a proper way to investigate that. Why don't you\r\nfind out where in that country they have been doing it?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I didn't see any grafted chestnut trees over there.\r\n\r\nA Member: You said they grafted, and then you say, \"I didn't see any.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: That's quite right, and I talked to their best horticultural\r\nauthorities that they have. Practically all of it is produced by seed\r\nand not by budding or grafting. It is just exactly as I said with the\r\nPersian walnut. China has no varieties of Persian walnuts, although\r\nsometimes you will find some farmer that will bud or graft his trees.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter: They graft up on the limb?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Yes, sir. Once in a while you will find one. They have a few\r\nreal horticulturists. I met one man over there that would compare very\r\nfavorably with Liberty Hyde Bailey.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Dr. MacDaniels asked for concrete evidence. He wanted to know\r\nwhere there was an orchard with 20-year-old grafted Chinese chestnut\r\ntrees. They haven't been planted that long, but I would like to give him\r\nconcrete evidence in my own experience.\r\n\r\nIn 1932 I got scions from the Department, got what ultimately became\r\nknown as the Hobson, from Jasper, Georgia. I grafted a tree in my front\r\nyard which is still bearing nicely, and in fact I have got two grafts on\r\nthat tree about four feet from the ground, and it is very nice with\r\nperfect union. At the same time I grafted a Carr right at the side of my\r\nhouse that also has a perfect union about the same height from the\r\nground. I grafted a scion sent me by Dr. Morris as Morris' best (which\r\nwas pretty poor), and it is still living. At the present time I have\r\nperhaps five Carr trees that will average six inches or more in\r\ndiameter. The oldest is the one by the side, of the house. The rest of\r\nthem were grafted about 1935. One out of those five, when it got to be\r\nabout six inches in diameter, in fact, about three years ago, it went\r\nbad. It is girdled and dead. It was grafted about as high as this table\r\nfrom the ground. The others are sound, and you'd find it very difficult\r\nto find where they were grafted.\r\n\r\nI have Hobson, perhaps a dozen trees anywhere from six to 16 years old,\r\nand I have not had a failure on a Hobson that really was once healed\r\nover properly and got to bearing, not one. That's concrete evidence,\r\nDoctor, and that's all I wish to say.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor (Alpine, Tenn.): Mr. Gravatt was about to answer a question\r\nabout our seed trees, wasn't he?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: Would you repeat that question?\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: Are some seed trees better than others in the high per cent\r\nof good seedlings they produce?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: Well, McKay has done some work and published it to show\r\nthat on seedlings of certain trees you get higher percentage of bud\r\ntakes than on others.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I think the question is a little confused. I think what you\r\nare after is, are there parent seed trees from which seed can be planted\r\nthat would produce a good quality of seedlings.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: Yes, of good productive seedlings. No grafting to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I think that was answered. Apparently there are.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: Apparently there are in China, as Dr. Crane brought up.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: He further brought up that those things are in the process of\r\nbeing tested here now, and he hopes for some information in--what was\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: We had Professor Beattie over in Japan, China, and Korea\r\nfor two or three years, and he found in Japan that there were certain\r\nselections there, certain grafted varieties that they used for seed\r\nstock. We imported those into this country. We were getting ready to go\r\nahead with the Japs. We also brought in a hundred varieties of Japanese\r\nchestnuts. But the Japanese varieties didn't do well here. What would\r\nproduce well over in Japan didn't produce well here. But a number of\r\nthose scions that we grafted in 1932 and 1933 are still living. We have\r\nhad very good success with top-working chestnuts in our orchards. We\r\nhave some grafts there of pure Chinese chestnuts top-worked on some\r\nworthless Japanese. Some of those have been there for 12 and 14 years,\r\nwith perfect unions. But we do receive a number of reports of trees\r\ndying from blight and various other and sundry other causes and when we\r\nexamine them quite frequently these have died back to where the trees\r\nhad been grafted.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: I could enlarge on that question just a little bit to tie\r\nin with what Mr. O'Rourke said. If the nurserymen are going to propagate\r\nseedling trees for the trade for some time yet, where should they be\r\nadvised to obtain their seed to get the best possible seedling trees?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: In a lot of our regional distributions we sent out\r\nmixtures. In other places we would send out related seedlings, as \"MY,\"\r\n\"MZ,\" or \"MAX,\" to different individuals. We have advised all\r\nnurseryman, all of our cooperators, to eliminate the Japanese; eliminate\r\nthe hybrids. It gets down to pure Chinese. We have also advised again\r\nand again to take out the more worthless trees and propagate seed from\r\nthe beat. But there are a lot of hybrid seeds with mixed parentage going\r\ninto nursery trees.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: How many people are going to take out trees now when they\r\ncan sell the seeds for at least 50 cents or maybe even $2.00 a pound?\r\n\r\nMr. Gravatt: That's it. However, you take any of those Chinese trees\r\nover there at the Eastern Shore Nurseries, for example--nuts from all 19\r\nof them have been sent over here, and they are all good eating. I have\r\nbeen over a lot of the seedlings of Hemming's trees. Mr. Hemming has\r\nseveral hundred at his own place. I have been over other orchard\r\nplantings. There is lot of variability among those seedlings. They are\r\nnot as uniform as the parent tree, for some reason. Why, I don't know.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Howell, as a nurseryman, has propagated the Chinese\r\nchestnut tree. Would you care to make a few comments? Mr. Howell has\r\nHowell's Nursery in Knoxville and at Sweetwater, Tennessee, and I\r\nbelieve has some of Mr. Gravatt's early seedling trees and has produced\r\na great quantity of seedlings.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruce Howell: A good many years ago we got from the Department five\r\ntrees, and they grew and have all borne good nuts, and all chestnuts we\r\nhave propagated since have been grown from seed from those five trees,\r\nand most of them are pretty good. One is a small nut, and among more\r\nrecent seedlings we have got two of them that don't bear at all, or\r\nhaven't so far. Now, we have got a bunch of them where they were set\r\nseveral years ago in nursery rows. At each end of each row the trees\r\nthere bear very nice nuts, and when you get out through that row, the\r\ncrowded trees don't bear at all.\r\n\r\nI think those seedlings and those trees practically all make fairly good\r\nnuts and some of them excellent. I have got some samples. About six\r\nyears ago I got a pound of imported Japanese I planted. The third year\r\nthey bore and they have done very well, and all of them are about the\r\nsame size chestnuts. They are as good as any _after_ they are roasted or\r\nboiled. That's about all. A good many years ago, I guess 30 years ago, I\r\ngrafted Paragon chestnuts, and they did well until the blight.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: Does anybody else have this trouble? In North Central\r\nTennessee we usually have a warm spell about the Middle of February,\r\nplowing time. We expect it every year. And then these Chinese chestnuts\r\nare the quickest trees to let the buds swell, and the bark softens up\r\nall the way to the ground on the young ones. Then we nearly always have\r\na pretty hard freeze, afterward. So, for several years after our\r\nexperimental planting was set out there they would get killed clear to\r\nthe ground next year. Is that something others have the same experience\r\nwith? How do you go at correcting that?\r\n\r\nAfter our trees got to be three or four or five inches in diameter they\r\ndidn't kill back that way. The bark seemed to be tougher.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: That's very common experience in Tennessee and, I might\r\nsay, in north Alabama.\r\n\r\nRev. Taylor: Nothing you can do about it?\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: On some sites it is not nearly so bad as it is in other\r\nlocations. A northern or eastern slope with good elevation seems to be\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nMr. Frye: I have had some trouble and maybe, had a good education about\r\nfrost pockets. If you get them in high elevations you escape that. I had\r\nthat trouble two years ago. I got some Chinese trees from Dr. Smith, set\r\nthem out. They were his best seedlings, three of them, and they started\r\nbeautifully. I transplanted them. Just about that time they got nipped\r\noff. Did that three times and failed to come out the third time.\r\n\r\nPres. Davidson: One other remedy for that that I remember reading about,\r\nI am not quite sure in which of our Reports--maybe Mr. Becker was the\r\nauthor, and that is this: He said that he cultivates until August after\r\nwhich he plants cover crops, and he sows cover crops that grow and they\r\nhold back this vegetative growth in the late part of the year, and it is\r\nreally the late vegetative growth that causes the destruction. After he\r\nadopted that plan he had very much less winter killing in his\r\nplantation. That might be one way of helping the situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: We have had some killing. Usually in the second year or the\r\nfirst year after we get killing down to the ground, if we will keep the\r\nstock pruned back to one shoot that one will make sufficient growth,\r\nbecome hardy enough to withstand any cold, or perhaps sun scald. Also\r\nwrapping the trunks of the trees with newspaper helps to prevent the\r\nvariations in temperature, which in our section is what causes the cold\r\ninjury. We don't have sufficient cold to cause absolute low-temperature\r\ninjury, but we do have sudden drops just as you do in Tennessee,\r\napparently, and wrapping with paper does help iron out those changes.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Wouldn't you suggest the paper wrap in the summer as well\r\nas the winter and spring?\r\n\r\nMr. Hardy: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: It is not only the planter of the trees that has sorrows\r\nalong that line, but the nurseryman does also. I had some nursery\r\nseedlings growing on flat land, and they looked all right, passed the\r\nwinter. When I went out to graft them I found that on these small stocks\r\nanywhere from the size of a lead pencil to the size of a finger, the\r\ncambium was discolored. It wasn't black nut brown. Any attempts I made\r\nto graft those failed, and yet many of those same trees grew on. They\r\nwere stunted somewhat for a year or two, and they left a brown ring at\r\nthat annual growth.\r\n\r\nI would say that the best guarantee against that kind of thing is to\r\nplant your chestnut orchards--and the nurseries--to plant on land that\r\nis well air drained. _Select the same site as you would for peaches._\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I will say that we should have allowed more time for\r\ndiscussion. However, we have used up our alloted time for this period.\r\nSupper is at six o'clock, and we are due back here at 7:30. I don't know\r\nhow you folks feel about this little session, but I certainly did enjoy\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: --Goldsworthy and his associates published several items\r\nalong this line in 1948 issues of +Plant Disease Reporter+. His October\r\n15, 1948 item reported a similar result of 25% technical DDT (with 75%\r\nclay) inhibiting growth of seedling peach roots on 1-year budded Elberta\r\ntrees. As low as 25 pound per acre application affected growth in quartz\r\nsand cultures, whereas with certain soils, no significant difference was\r\nnoted until an 800 lb. per acre level of the DDT was reached. It was\r\nsurmised that possibly some unknown constituent in the technical DDT was\r\nresponsible for the suppression of new root growth, and consequent\r\nslowing down of top growth. In the case of Blakemore strawberries, and\r\nalso with peaches, this effect has persisted for at least two crop\r\nyears. Goldsworthy and Dunegan say, \"How many other economic crop plants\r\nmay be injured is unknown, but it appears certain that some caution is\r\nnecessary in the promiscuous use of the chemical on ... plants, either\r\nas ... sprays or as soil additions....\" In these experiments, of course,\r\nthe DDT-containing material was in direct contact with all the roots.\r\nSpray residues ordinarily would be present only in the surface layer of\r\nthe soil, and should have much less effect on tree roots in that\r\ncase.--J. C. McDaniel.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: --Dr. McKay of the U. S. D. A. found one tree only about\r\n2.5% fruitful to its own pollen.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: --There is a possibility of pollination from American\r\nchestnut sprouts in his vicinity.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's adjourn.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 5:30 p. m. the meeting was adjourned, to reconvene at\r\n7:30 o'clock p. m. of the same day.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+Evening Session+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The meeting will come to order, please. We first\r\nhave the pleasure of hearing from Dr. C. A. Moss of Williamsburg,\r\nKentucky, on Greetings from a Kentucky Nut. Dr. Moss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings from a Kentucky Nut\r\n\r\nDR. C. A. MOSS, Williamsburg, Kentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nI am glad to see all of these beautiful ladies here this evening. We\r\njust had dinner, and I presume I should make an after-dinner speech. I\r\nhave always wanted to attend a Northern Nut Growers Association\r\nconvention. I am more or less of what you might call a convention addict\r\nand speak on any occasion on slight provocation. I attended a convention\r\nat Quebec earlier this year, and after that I went on to Rio de Janiero\r\nin South America and attended another convention, but this privilege of\r\nbeing able to attend the Northern Nut Growers Association tops all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of the tale of the man who rushed into the sheriff's\r\noffice in Texas, and his gun was smoking, and he says, \"I have killed a\r\nman.\" The sheriff said, \"Who did you kill?\" \"Oh,\" he says, \"I don't know\r\nhis name. He is one of these after-dinner speakers.\" \"You are in the\r\nwrong room,\" the sheriff said. \"Go back in the hallway three doors to\r\nthe right to the bounty room. They pay $5 a head for those.\"\r\n\r\nMy family fortunes, if there be any, were founded on nuts. My father\r\nwhen he was 16 years old was raised on Straight Creek near Pineville,\r\nKentucky, some hundred miles away from Lexington, and they gathered up a\r\nwagonload of the old chestnuts, he and a hired man on my grandfather's\r\nplace, and they took an ox team and took them to Lexington to peddle\r\nthem out. It took them three weeks to make the return trip.\r\n\r\nI come from Whitney County, Kentucky. It was named after old Colonel\r\nWhitney, the man who built the first brick house in Kentucky. It was in\r\nthe fall of the year, and the mortar was freezing, and they mixed\r\nwhiskey with their mortar to keep it from freezing.\r\n\r\nWhen I get away from home they ask me if I am a Kentucky Colonel. That's\r\none of the first things I hear, and I tell them that I am. And they want\r\nto know why they put that honor upon a small fellow like me, and I tell\r\nthem it was on account of scientific research that I had done, that I\r\nhad developed a new way of making egg-nog. I feed the chickens the\r\nwhiskey mash and they lay bourbon-flavored eggs, and all you have to do\r\nis drop one in a glass of milk.\r\n\r\nThey always ask about the Kentucky Derby, and I tell them that the last\r\nI heard Mint Julep was coming in on the home stretch strong.\r\n\r\nI am not qualified with all of these experts to get up here and talk\r\nabout nuts. They say an expert is a fellow that learns more and more\r\nabout less and less until he knows practically everything about nothing\r\nat all; and that's kind of my shape, sir.\r\n\r\nNow, seriously, I have had this hobby of trying to grow nuts for a\r\nnumber of years. I grafted a golf club on a croquet post, and I got some\r\nwonderful golf balls. Before the war I ordered some Chinese chestnuts. I\r\ngot in touch with Sakata and Company in Yokahama, and they finally came\r\nin. I didn't have any experience, and about all I had was some\r\nimagination, and I planted them out in the fall of the year like I\r\nplanted any other nuts. I went out in the spring and investigated. There\r\nwasn't a darn one come up. The rats had beat me to them and eaten them\r\nall up.\r\n\r\nI was a persistent cuss and ordered some the next year, and I put them\r\nup in fruit jars and figured I would plant them in the spring, and when\r\nthe spring came they all had the dry rot.\r\n\r\nSo I ordered them the third year, and I made sacks out of fly screen\r\nwire and put those nuts outside, and in the spring they came up and I\r\nhad a lot of nice sprouts about this high and put them in a seed bed\r\nwith a board all the way around. My father is blind in one eye, couldn't\r\ntell a chestnut from a weed, and he pulled up the weeds and he pulled\r\nall the chestnuts up except one.\r\n\r\nThe fourth year I had better success, and I raised that year\r\n400-and-some-odd chestnut seedlings, and I did more or less the Johnny\r\nAppleseed stuff with those. I gave those away in the community. I am,\r\namong other things, a banker, and I figured those would be as good as\r\ncalendars, and I have not been able to follow the history of them.\r\nHowever, there is one of them I think is exceptional. It's a\r\nself-pollinator and is bearing heavy crops, and I intend to follow that\r\nparticular tree up.\r\n\r\nA genius, he is no better than any of the rest of us. All a genius is is\r\na fellow that's got good digestion so he can eat enough to work long\r\nhours and good eyesight so he don't get tired.\r\n\r\nSo I was reading in a magazine about the Crath English walnut. They sent\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Crath over to Poland before the war, and I got four\r\npounds of those nuts he collected, and planted them. And every spring a\r\ncold spell would come along and get them before I could cut any grafts\r\noff of them. And I planted a Nebraska pecan and got some grafts from it,\r\nand my wife said that tree never did have a chance because I kept\r\ncutting the prunes off so they couldn't grow. I got several to growing,\r\nand then they didn't fill out the nuts.\r\n\r\nI was talking to a good doctor here from Baltimore last night. We ate\r\ndinner, at the same table here, and I told him I didn't see but one\r\nthing wrong with this Northern Nut Growers Association: It needed a lot\r\nof young people in it, because if it didn't they were going to have to\r\nhold a reunion over at the cemetery.\r\n\r\nI have done a lot of grafting, and I am not going into the details of\r\nthat. I am going to say that I am glad to be here, I give you greetings\r\nfrom Kentucky, and I hope that I will meet you all again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That certainly was refreshing, Dr. Moss. We enjoyed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNext on the program is Dr. Aubrey Richards, Whiteville, Tennessee, who\r\nis not here. Nuts for West Tennessee is the subject of that paper, and\r\nSecretary MacDaniel will read it for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Trees for West Tennessee\r\n\r\nAUBREY RICHARDS, M.D., Whiteville, Tennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time I am attempting to grow 14 grafted varieties of\r\nChinese and Japanese chestnuts, plus numerous hybrids and seedlings,\r\neight varieties of black walnut, 5 named Persian and 18 unnamed\r\nCarpathians, 5 heartnuts, 5 hickory and hickory hybrids, 12 pecans, and\r\n7 hazels and filberts. The total number of trees, including all\r\nvarieties, is well over three hundred. A few of the trees have been\r\nunder my observation for 11 years on down to some that I have just\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nI shall not bore you with a list of unsatisfactory varieties nor with\r\nthe ones that have not had sufficient observation in this section, but\r\nshall confine my remarks to less than two dozen varieties.\r\n\r\nPecans I shall touch only lightly, as they are a highly specialized crop\r\nonly a little farther south. Stuart and Success are favorites here.\r\nSchley and Mahan are good if scab can be controlled. Sun scald on newly\r\nplanted trees is our greatest problem, which I control by a paper wrap\r\nmade by cutting two inch sections from a 36 inch roll of cheap felt-base\r\nwall paper. It gradually weathers away during the second summer. I wrap\r\nfrom the top down in a spiral, and when I reach the bottom, I place a\r\nhand full of earth on the end of the paper. No tying is required. In\r\nthis way I have reduced the mortality rate of young nut trees greatly.\r\nI am also a strong believer in cover crops and mulching, for Tennessee\r\nweather is very temperamental.\r\n\r\nAlthough we get ample rainfall per annum, it is often not well\r\ndistributed, especially during mid-summer. During the winter we have\r\nseveral days of balmy spring weather with a drop to possibly below zero\r\noccuring overnight.\r\n\r\nThomas black walnut grows well here, but tends to over-bear, with many\r\npoorly filled nuts on alternate years. I counted an average of 8 nuts\r\nper lineal foot of bearing wood on one tree this season.\r\n\r\nSnyder and Stambaugh are excellent nuts, setting about all they can\r\nmature.\r\n\r\nElmer Myers is a beautiful thin shelled nut, but so far a little shy in\r\nbearing. I believe this can be corrected if I can find another walnut\r\nthat will shed pollen late enough to catch the Myers pistils. Homeland\r\nmay be the one to do it. I have set some grafts of it with the Myers to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nCarpathian D, and a variety of unknown origin from Haywood County are\r\nthe only Persian walnuts I have fruited. This tree of unknown origin\r\ngrows alone, is at least 50 years old, is three feet in diameter, has a\r\nspread of 40 feet, and is about the same in height. Some years it\r\nproduces a heavy crop, others, nothing. To my knowledge, it has received\r\nno care in the past 20 years.\r\n\r\nMy 18 Carpathians are all growing with varying vigor and resistance to\r\nleaf spot. None has shown winter injury.\r\n\r\nOf all the heartnuts, Rhodes is my favorite. The nut does not appear to\r\nbe as large as some, but the kernel is just as heavy, due to its compact\r\nshape which causes it to fall out when the nut is cracked. It is\r\nself-pollenizing and also a good pollenizer for all my other varieties,\r\nshedding pollen over a long period of time, although it is the latest of\r\nall in producing its pistils. It grows vigorously on black walnut stock.\r\n\r\nRush seems to be the best filbert for this section. Its catkins are\r\nusually hardy here.\r\n\r\nChestnut trees, like gray ghosts, still reach their naked arms high on\r\nmany West Tennessee hillsides, and occasionally one finds a farmer\r\nsplitting posts from their remains, for chestnut is an enduring wood. A\r\nfew of these tenacious individuals are still sending up sprouts that may\r\nreach considerable size before they are again struck down.\r\n\r\nI have had no serious trouble with blight in any of the named chestnut\r\nvarieties, either Chinese or Japanese. I have lost some trees by its\r\nentrance into the seedling stock, but not many. My greatest headache has\r\nbeen sun-scald and winter killing, or to be more exact, \"early spring\"\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nOne of the juvenile characteristics of oriental chestnuts is the\r\nretention of their leaves all winter. They also grow in a rather\r\nsprangling way. This is a protective mechanism, and when we prune them\r\nto an upright form, or graft, this wood having lost its juvenile\r\ncharacteristics, we are inviting trouble unless we protect the trunk in\r\nsome other way. I prefer to use a paper wrap as described under Pecans,\r\nas it is quickly done and is inexpensive. This also gives protection to\r\nimmature callus cells at bud or graft union.\r\n\r\nOf the older Chinese chestnut varieties in my hands, Hobson has\r\nexcelled, with large chestnuts (34 to the pound in 1948.) Zimmerman also\r\nproduces a good nut. Colossal (Hybrid) is very productive and produces\r\nthe largest nuts of any chestnut that I have seen grown in Tennessee,\r\nbut the quality of the raw nut is not equal to Hobson. It refuses to\r\ngrow on Chinese stock, but thrives on Japanese. It is pollen sterile. I\r\nhave several newer varieties under observation and although they are\r\ngrowing vigorously I have not had time to form an opinion on them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The Reverend Bernard Taylor of Alpine, Tennessee,\r\nwill next read a paper on The Marketing of Black Walnuts as a Community\r\nProject. Mr. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing Black Walnuts as a Community Project\r\n\r\nTHE REV. BERNARD TAYLOR, Alpine, Tennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Taylor: I suppose that every community where black walnuts\r\ngrow wild has a marketing of some kind, some kind of a plan of\r\nmarketing, maybe just what every boy or every man who has some spare\r\ntime or some of the womenfolks may do to make something out of the\r\nwalnuts that are lying around.\r\n\r\nIn the community of Alpine, which is in Overton County, people used to\r\ngo out on the ridge with wagons and bring home wagonloads of walnuts,\r\nand they would sell them either in the shell or they would crack them\r\nand sell them in pretty poor condition, however they could sell them.\r\nWhen we first began selling walnut kernels in Alpine we got 19 cents a\r\npound for the kernels, and that was more than they were worth, I\r\nbelieve, because they were dirty, greasy, and they had mildew gobs in\r\nthe bunches of kernels. So I don't know how the rolling stores that came\r\naround that way could make anything out of them trading them in at that\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThen we began to study the Government bulletins on how to produce good\r\nwalnut kernels, and there is a good bulletin on that; all of you are\r\nacquainted with it, probably. When we began to harvest those nuts and\r\nhull them as quickly as we could and wash them and dry them out\r\nthoroughly and then crack them before they got too dry, we organized\r\nwhat was called the Walnut Club. This Walnut Club mostly was composed of\r\nsome of the women of the community who lived up in one little cove where\r\nthe limestone outcroppings seem to favor the walnut and the air drainage\r\nor whatever it was seemed to favor the crop yields rather regularly. We\r\ndon't have an every-year good walnut crop.\r\n\r\nWell, these women got finally so that they could get 35 cents a pound\r\nfor their walnut kernels, then 45 cents a pound. Then we found a good\r\nfriend in Pennsylvania who would take those kernels, all we could send\r\nher, and put them up in little pound packages and sell them for whatever\r\nshe could get and send us all the money. That's altogether contrary to\r\nHoyle I guess.\r\n\r\nYou merchants, if there are some of you here, who are dealers in walnut\r\nkernels know that our people were just getting spoiled. Anytime now that\r\na merchant says, \"I will give you such-and-such a price for the walnuts\r\nand then I will sell them for such-and-such a price,\" he looks to them\r\nlike a robber. They want to sell them for what the people pay who eat\r\nthem. That isn't quite fair, maybe, but we got $1.39 a pound last year\r\nfor all the kernels we could produce, and the year before it was $1.40,\r\nI believe, and it stays about that price.\r\n\r\nThat is about the story of the community project. It is a direct contact\r\nby way of a benevolent friend between people in the mountains in\r\nTennessee and people in Pennsylvania who say that these kernels taste\r\nbetter than black walnut kernels in Pennsylvania taste. I don't know\r\nwhether any Pennsylvanians here agree with that or not. I think they are\r\nwonderfully mild-flavored, a good many of them very light-colored\r\nkernels. Though Mr. Chase has made some beautiful exhibits of how the\r\ncolor changes depending on how long a time you leave them in the hull,\r\nwe still have some that stay lighter than others. Some of them have\r\nrather gray-colored kernels.\r\n\r\nThere is one of those trees that Mrs. Ledbetter has, on her husband's\r\nfarm. He was about to sell that tree for a log and a stump. They come\r\nalong and grub the stumps out and sell the stumps and all for\r\nveneerwood. But she wouldn't let him sell it, and over the course of the\r\nlast few years they sold enough kernels more than to pay for that walnut\r\ntree and it is still going to yield a good many years, probably better\r\nand better as time goes on.\r\n\r\nI think that possibly the community angle of this is a little bit\r\nmisrepresenting. It's not the entire community, but it is a little group\r\nof the community who are interested in the wild black walnut.\r\n\r\nLast spring we were very fortunate in having some help in grafting some\r\nof the seedlings. This Mrs. Ledbetter's husband got interested in\r\nwalnuts, and he planted a whole pasture with walnuts spaced every so\r\noften, and this spring we went there with the help of God and were able\r\nto graft those to Thomas black walnuts. They were just little seedlings,\r\nso we hope to go into the named black walnuts as time goes on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: May I ask, Mr. Taylor, the people, of course, now\r\ncomply with the Government regulations on pasteurization and so on?\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor: Never heard of it. You will have to tell me about that after\r\na while, if you will, please.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Mr. Shadow, the County Agent of Decatur, Meigs\r\nCounty, Tennessee, will tell his experiences with tree crops in that\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiences with Tree Crops in Meigs County, Tennessee\r\n\r\nW. A. SHADOW, Meigs County Agent, Decatur, Tennessee\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Shadow: Mr. Chairman and members of the Nut Growers Association: As\r\nPresident Davidson announced, I am an agricultural agent. About twelve\r\nyears ago I thought it would be good to have a hobby, and since I was\r\nborn and reared in the nursery world propagating fruit trees and\r\nornamentals, and due to the fact that John Hershey came by one day and\r\ntalked to me about the tree crops in the Tennessee Valley, it struck me\r\njust right, and I have made that my hobby.\r\n\r\nYou know, every man who has a job gets fed up on his job and needs to\r\nget out and play with himself, or something else, to forget his\r\ntroubles. So I find in propagating nut trees, top-working them, if you\r\nwill, top-working trees where I find them to named varieties, is very\r\ninteresting to me.\r\n\r\nJohn Hershey taught me the technique of grafting nut trees. I had\r\ngrafted and budded in all kinds of ornamentals and fruits, but I needed\r\ntraining in nut trees. So in the spring of 1935, I guess, I grafted\r\nabout a hundred Thomas black walnut on trees where I found them in the\r\nwoodland. At the same time I grafted maybe a hundred Japanese persimmon\r\nof possibly a dozen varieties on the common native persimmon. I\r\npurchased three, four, maybe five Japanese persimmons and planted these\r\ntrees in the spring of 1935. All these persimmons, maybe 60 or 70 of\r\nthem, grew nicely. The Thomas grew very well, and the winter of 1939 or\r\n1940, I don't recall just which, was rather severe. We had below-zero\r\nweather, and all of my persimmons were killed--I thought. The next year\r\nI found a persimmon tree up in the woods with maybe a peck of great big\r\nnice persimmons and later I found that that was a Fuyugaki persimmon.\r\nAll the rest of mine were winter killed. Those that I purchased were\r\nwinter killed the first year. I don't know why. I grafted the persimmon\r\nabout 5 feet high. Those that were grafted at the ground I noticed\r\nwinter killed the first year, and these that are grafted up about\r\nshoulder high seemed to live three or four years before they winter\r\nkilled, and the one variety that survived as Mr. Kline and Mr. Chase, or\r\nsomeone, has told, is Fuyugaki, I believe. I have a Tamopan persimmon, a\r\ngreat big, nice persimmon about so big, but bitter as the dickens, and\r\nabout the only thing I think it is good for is to look at. It is pretty.\r\nBut the Fuyugaki is never bitter. It is very tasty even partially green,\r\nand as it ripens my lady thinks it is very good, and I think it is good,\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI have about two or three varieties of mulberries. I got them from Glen\r\nSt. Mary Nurseries in Florida. They make awfully good pig feed and bird\r\nfeed, and I don't mind eating them myself.\r\n\r\nThere are some honeylocust, Millwood and Calhoun. I purchased several\r\nseedlings of thornless honeylocust from some northwestern nursery and\r\ngrafted them to Millwood and Calhoun. I also have four trees that are\r\nten years old and they have never borne. Last year there was one tree of\r\nthat hundred that bore heavily, and the rest of them are barren. It must\r\nbe lack of pollenization, or something. I am not getting fruit from my\r\nhoneylocust.\r\n\r\nSomeone asked me what I am going to do with all this stuff, and I said,\r\n\"Well, the squirrels and I will have lots of fun anyhow, and the cows\r\nwill eat the honeylocust if they ever bear.\"\r\n\r\nI have two pecan trees that are bearing nicely. One is a Posey and the\r\nother is a Greenriver, bearing very nicely. They are about ten years\r\nold. I have some Schley and Delmas and Mahan, and they are not bearing.\r\nI don't know why. We are out of the realm of the southern pecan and too\r\nfar south for the northern pecan, I am afraid.\r\n\r\nMy Persian walnut, heartnut and Japanese walnut think it is spring too\r\nquick, and every year they burst out and grow about so long, and then\r\nthey fall down and die from freezing, and then they grow out, and this\r\ntime of the year you look at them and you say, \"That's a beautiful\r\ntree,\" But they freeze just enough to get the fruit each year.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel came by last spring a year ago and left with me a little\r\nscion of a Carpathian walnut, the Bayer selection. I wasn't present,\r\nbut he left it with my lady and suggested to my lady that I would know\r\nwhat to do with it. I put it on a common black walnut grafted about so\r\nhigh, and it is ten feet high now growing nicely, but this spring I\r\nnoticed that it, too, thought the spring was here before it was here. I\r\ndon't know how it is going to bear. I may have to take it out on top of\r\nthe hill and re-graft it on a high place where it has more air drainage.\r\n\r\nOf the Chinese chestnut, I planted about a hundred, but I planted them\r\nin a cut-over woodland that was full of native chestnut sprouts. You\r\nknow how the chestnut sprouts will do. They grow up and blight out and\r\ndie down, and another sprout comes from the stump. They have been doing\r\nthat for 30 years over in my part of the country. I planted these\r\nchestnuts purposely in that grove where there was lots of blight. Out of\r\nthat hundred I have eight trees that are alive. The rest of them have\r\ndied from blight. They are bearing very nicely, but I haven't learned\r\nhow to care for those fruits so that they are good a long period of\r\ntime. Someone just told me that you had someone on the program this\r\nmorning who would tell us that. It is a very interesting subject for me.\r\n\r\nAnd the Thomas walnut is a nice black walnut. The trees are a little bit\r\npeculiar about their bearing; sometimes they bear heavily and again they\r\nforget to bear. The Stabler doesn't bear at all for me. I just know they\r\nare Stablers because someone told me so. I have them labeled. I have\r\nCreitz black walnut. I got five from TVA four or five years ago, and\r\nthey just literally bear themselves to death. They're about so high and\r\nbear every year, very nice nuts. I will have to pull the walnuts off\r\nlong enough to make them grow up and make real trees. I think they are\r\ngoing to be all right.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I am not an expert. I use my hobby to keep from bothering\r\nabout the troubles that I have with other things, and when I get mad at\r\na neighbor I go to playing on my trees, and it gets me well. I recommend\r\nit as a very soothing hobby.\r\n\r\nNow, some day we will make a business out of tree crops when we in\r\nTennessee get the bugs out of it and get them so we will have the right\r\nvarieties to produce. I am not satisfied with the Thomas. Someone\r\nsuggested it was a wonderful nut. I am not satisfied with it. We need a\r\nbetter walnut than the Thomas. But it's the best I have.\r\n\r\nThere is a native walnut I found in the valley near Watts Bar Dam. I\r\nnamed it Pineland. It is just a seedling. It is a most wonderful nut if\r\nit wasn't for its hard shell. It's hard as the dickens. It is a\r\nwonderful bearer, has borne every year for nine years. It happens to be\r\nin unusually good soil. But I have grafted a few up away from the river,\r\nand the grafted trees are bearing nicely. The trouble is it is hard, but\r\nit is a wonderful good kernel and it is a big nut.\r\n\r\nGroups like this working with tree crops and nuts over a period of time\r\nwill develop the right varieties, and if we can get some youngsters\r\ninterested--and I am in my county getting some youngsters interested in\r\ngrafting--and tell them not to expect too much but get a whole lot of\r\nsatisfaction out of the fun of producing something, I think this will be\r\nthe beginning. Or rather, you have been going a long time. This is a\r\nmeans of progress in tree crops that I am well pleased to take a part\r\nin. Mr. Chairman, I think that's about all that I have.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I know we all wish we had more county agents like\r\nthat, interested in trees and interested in young folks. Those two\r\nthings should go together. I wish you would just sort of propagate that\r\nidea when you meet other county agents, won't you, Mr. Shadow?\r\n\r\nNow, then, Mr. Frye of Pleasant Dale, West Virginia, will tell us\r\nsomething about Nut Hobbying in Eastern West Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Hobbying in Eastern West Virginia\r\n\r\nWILBERT M. FRYE, Pleasant Dale, West Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Frye: After hearing such wonderful speeches as we have had, with\r\nyour reading, Mr. McDaniel, I wish I could be all of us, but as it is, I\r\nam just myself. I don't know how many know where Pleasant Dale is, but\r\nanyhow, you know where Washington, D. C. is; I live just along U. S. 50\r\nand my section is 103 miles west of Washington, D. C. That will locate\r\nwhere we are.\r\n\r\nThis section of the country is composed of a lot of long ridges with\r\nsteep hills, narrow valleys, some of them very fertile. These valleys\r\nform bases where you will get the draft off these hills down into the\r\nvalleys. You must keep all the fruit and most of the nut trees out of\r\nthose places, or you have these frost spots that I have been telling\r\nsome of you about.\r\n\r\nAs far back as people can remember that country has been covered with\r\nall kinds of nuts except the European (Persian or \"English\") walnuts,\r\nand the early people coming in there used these nuts for food, and the\r\nchestnut was their main one. Whenever a person clearing the land found a\r\nnice tree he would save it. Then he would show much pride in having a\r\ngood tree, and it kept on going until there became a rivalry as to who\r\nhad the best chestnut tree. Some had an orchard of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the blight hit the country I had an orchard of chestnut trees. When\r\nI saw the first blight in the top of a tree I didn't like the looks. I\r\nkept noticing that. It kept on coming down the tree, and it killed the\r\nbase. The total result was everybody lost their hobby trees, and then\r\nsoon they changed to something else.\r\n\r\nNow, when the blight took the chestnut out of the country the people\r\nbegan to pride themselves on the walnut, who had the best walnut, who\r\nhad the best shagbark in the country.\r\n\r\nSome distance from where I am is a two-acre grove, a wonderful grove of\r\nour larger nuts. Some places it is called kingnut and some places they\r\ncall it under the name of this big one in the show room, shellbark.\r\nAnyhow, there were two acres there and real moist meadows, and every\r\nonce in a while the frost would kill those nuts, and the next year they\r\nwould have a wonderful crop. So the climate determines whether we have\r\nan annual crop or an intermittent crop on these trees.\r\n\r\nThen I always liked to mess around with hobbies with nature. I became\r\ninterested, got to wondering who did have the best of the best. Then I\r\nbegan to go out and visit all of these farms and ask them for a certain\r\nnumber of the best, and I began to send them around to Mr. Reed and Mr.\r\nZarger and other people to take their word on it. And, of course, I have\r\nlocated some that cracked very well. But every once in a while somebody\r\ntells me they have got a better one yet, and the other day I ran across\r\na fellow a hundred miles away--he happened to hear about me, and I have\r\na neighbor who knows him--who has a black walnut that looks like a\r\nPersian walnut. So you see, I have a trip of a hundred miles to make to\r\nsee what he's got. I wrote to him just before I left. I wrote to him to\r\nsend me at least 20 of those nuts, and just as soon as this fellow sends\r\nme the nuts I would come up and see him and later on would try to get\r\nsome grafting wood and send down to Mr. Zarger of the TVA group.\r\n\r\nMy job is not to keep them to myself but to put out the best. So we have\r\nthose different nuts, and now it is time to consolidate the best in what\r\nwe have and get them in the hands of the nut growers groups and those\r\nwho will put them out and really make use of them. But first we want to\r\nsee these best trees all over the country. Some of them are not as good\r\nfor timber as the others, but I like to incorporate the timber with the\r\nnut production.\r\n\r\nWe talked about the black walnut earlier today. The speaker was not\r\nsaying much about flavor. That's one thing we want to do in all of our\r\nnut work, get as good a flavor as we can. So why not get the best and go\r\nputting it out to give it to everybody. Why keep anything within\r\nourselves? That's the main thing we can do.\r\n\r\nA brother was talking a while ago about this nut job, a community nut\r\njob. Now, two years ago--I will have to use my dad, who is 82 years old,\r\nas a little reference--my dad cracked 83 pounds of black walnuts from\r\njust the best of them, you might say. Sold them at a price of $1.49 a\r\npound. So that wasn't bad, was it? I thought that was right good.\r\n\r\nLast year we didn't have a nut in there because we had a freeze on the\r\n31st of May of around 26 deg. to 28 deg., depending on where you were and the\r\nlocation. But then in the fall on the 23rd of September we had another\r\ndrop just when everything was in full growth, due to a dry spell and\r\nthen a rain. But in the fall on the 23rd of September we had a drop down\r\nto 20, so that was what happened to all the remaining nuts in that\r\ncountry. They were just frozen like black mummies.\r\n\r\nI had what they call the Texas Thinshell black walnut. I have one tree\r\nthat is about eight or nine feet high, maybe ten feet high, had 45 nuts\r\non it, nice big ones, and they just looked like mummies, and it made me\r\nheartsick, of course. I went out there and looked at the things, and\r\nthey fell off the tree. I thought, \"Well, I might just as well\r\nexperiment. I will dig me a little trench here along the garden, I will\r\nput these in and see what happens.\" To my surprise 20 of them came up\r\nafter being frozen. So that might be a question: Will things sprout or\r\ngerminate without reaching maturity?[17] I don't know how much maturity\r\nthey had. They certainly weren't in full growth when they were frozen.\r\nThat's one thing we want to see.\r\n\r\nMy main aim is just to grow things, for hobby purposes and see just what\r\nwill grow. Last year we had such a hectic year from that late spring\r\nfreeze and early fall freeze it discouraged me here where I am, in this\r\nfrost pocket at an elevation of 1,050 feet. And I said, \"Now, on the\r\nhill about 4 miles away and 300 feet higher they have a wonderful place\r\nfor peaches.\" I have a friend who lives up there, and he has so many\r\npeach trees missing in his old orchard. I said, \"How about setting out\r\nsome nut trees in your peach orchard?\" Ho said, \"Go to it.\" I set out a\r\nnut tree wherever there is a peach tree out. So that gave me a chance to\r\nsee what they would do. Last spring I started that too late, but I set\r\nout 45 or 50 trees, filberts, Persian walnuts, pecans, chestnuts and\r\npersimmons, and I will just see what they will do.\r\n\r\nAnd today my kind friend who gave a talk on the nut trees from down in\r\nAlabama gave me seed to plant. I expect to put a row of those out and\r\nsee what they will do. The land I am planting them on at one time was\r\njust a great mass of chestnuts, and this friend there on one of those\r\nsections, of about three acres, had cut 35,000 feet of this dead timber\r\nafter the chestnut blight killed them.\r\n\r\nThat blight was a terrible shock to us. One thing I did note when it\r\ncame on, prior to the chestnut blight in that country there were these\r\nlittle chipmunks, which, everybody knows, eat chestnuts. You couldn't\r\nhear yourself think for the little chipmunks chipping all over the\r\ncountry. You know, they carried off all the nuts. You had to be smart to\r\nbeat them to them. When the chestnuts disappeared, the chipmunks\r\ndisappeared, and there were eight or ten years when you were lucky if\r\nyou got to hear one. In the meantime those little fellows have changed.\r\nThey died, a lot of them, but now they have learned to eat something\r\nelse, and now they are coming back.\r\n\r\nThat little chipmunk always amused me, because I loved to go out and\r\nplay with the squirrels and things like that. Anyhow, it's just pure\r\nhobby work, and as Mr. Shadow says you can get over a mad spell and get\r\nout close to nature, because in this nut work you can't get any closer\r\nto God's work than to get out and get something better. I think that's\r\nall I have to say.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Some other members have reported similar behavior of\r\nfrost-bitten and poorly filled black walnuts.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Those of you who know Mr. Frye know that he works as\r\nwell as he talks, and that's pretty good.\r\n\r\nIs Mr. Tatum here? (No response.) In that case I am told that Dr.\r\nRohrbacher will read a paper by Mr. Tatum of Lebanon, Kentucky on \"A\r\nLook, Backward and Forward, Into Nut Growing in Kentucky.\" Dr\r\nRohrbacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Look \"Backward and Forward\" into Nut Growing in Kentucky\r\n\r\nW. G. TATUM, Route 4, Lebanon, Kentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lumberman's ax, the chestnut blight, forest fires, and the \"new\r\nground\" hill farmer, together, have destroyed many thousands of our\r\nbeautiful Kentucky forest acres. Much of this one time \"nature lover's\r\nparadise\" is now ugly, barren, and eroded, and too poor to give a living\r\nto either man or beast. Wanton destruction of God-given treasure and\r\nbeauty is a sin and a shame. Thanks to the men of vision and foresight\r\nof the U.S.D.A., state agricultural colleges, and our own fraternity of\r\nnut tree lovers, this slaughter is coming to a halt at last. Our fellow\r\ncitizens are being awakened to the real value of their woodlands. Much\r\nreforestation of these steep barren wastes is already under way.\r\n\r\nWe, of THE NORTHERN NUT GROWERS ASSOCIATION, INC., can look back to many\r\nmistakes we have made in the selection of varieties for our respective\r\nclimates and soils. Our dates and methods of grafting, budding, and\r\ntransplanting have not always been right. We have gotten hold of\r\nscionwood that we were most sure would not grow when we used it, but we\r\ndid use it, hoping, and most of it did fail, as we expected.\r\n\r\nIn our Association, we have a large group of wise experimenters on\r\nvarieties and methods, well placed all over the U. S. and I have every\r\nconfidence that, in time, many commercially profitable varieties, and\r\nbetter methods will reward their research. But in the meantime, we\r\nshould all keep ever on the alert for a new and better idea, or variety.\r\n\r\nHere in Central Kentucky, of the many black walnuts I have under test,\r\nonly Thomas, Victoria, and Eureka have the tendency toward young and\r\nheavy bearing. These three do show great promise in my section as young\r\nand heavy croppers. And they are all top-bracket nuts, according to\r\ntests made by expert testers. There may be newer ones better than these,\r\nand we hope there will be yet better ones turn up continually in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThere are at least a few Persian walnuts that show promise in my\r\nlocation. Of varieties I have of bearing age, only four are worthy of\r\nmention. These are Broadview, Elmore, \"Crath-Dunstan No. I\" and\r\n\"Crath-Edmunds No. 3.\" All of the above have borne well on two year old\r\ngrafts on large black walnut stocks. Their nuts are in my opinion\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nWright and Walters heartnuts seem well adapted here, and are doing\r\nequally well for me on Japanese, butternut, and black rootstocks. These\r\nare the only two I have old enough to bear, and they are bearing their\r\nfirst few nuts each this season. I would like to add here, that the wild\r\nnut crop in general in my section, is very light, and these nut trees\r\nthat I mention as bearing this season, are the more to be noticed for\r\ntheir crops in this year of bad nut crops. I am trying \"buartnuts\" and\r\nbutternuts, which are growing satisfactorily, but not large enough for a\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThis is wonderful natural chestnut territory. All of the many Chinese\r\nseedlings I have, and the few grafted ones, are growing nicely, and\r\nquite a number have burs on them when only about belt high to an average\r\nman. I am anxious to get graftwood of superior individuals as they come\r\nout, for propagation here in my own planting. I believe this to be a\r\ngood home for any good chestnut. No blight is showing to date in either\r\nmy seedlings or grafted ones.\r\n\r\nI live on rather deep, fertile upland, and am quite hopeful of good\r\nresults from many of the Northern pecan varieties that I am trying. The\r\noldest trees I have are only five years old, on small seedling stocks\r\nand hardly old enough to yield a crop for at least another five years.\r\nMajor, Greenriver, Busseron, and Fisher are my oldest, and are making\r\nrapid growth. Stuart, of the Southern group, is bearing quite well for\r\nmy friend, Lewis Edmunds, a few miles southwest of me, and he says it\r\nmatures its nuts well before frost, but insects cause a goodly part of\r\nthe crop to fall prematurely.\r\n\r\nI have quite a collection of the better known grafted shagbarks on my\r\nwoodland. These are mostly on wild shagbark stocks. They are all growing\r\nwell, but I have had no nuts from them as yet. Grainger is the fastest\r\ngrower of the lot.\r\n\r\nTo make my nut tree project complete, I have quite a long row of\r\nfilberts and hazels, set hedge row fashion, which include quite a list\r\nof varieties. Those that bear quite regular and heavy crops include four\r\n\"Jones Hybrids,\" Winkler hazel, two un-named hazels, and Barcelona\r\nfilbert.\r\n\r\nI have persimmons, too, both American and Chinese named varieties. My\r\nChinese are young and not bearing yet, but doing well. Kansas and\r\nJosephine are my choice of the natives.\r\n\r\nI am trying Millwood and Shessler honeylocusts for the first time this\r\nyear. They are beautiful grafts, and I am looking forward to the\r\npleasure and profit of adding them to my hill cow pasture in a year or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, very much, Dr. Rohrbacher. We have 15\r\nminutes before the next order comes on the program. Suppose you take a\r\nrecess right now.\r\n\r\n(A recess was taken.)\r\n\r\n(Mr. William J. Wilson from Georgia showed moving pictures of his pecan\r\norchard.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The next order of business, we will now hear a\r\nreport of the Committee on Black Walnut Standards and Judging by Dr. L.\r\nH. MacDaniels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRound Table Discussion on Judging Schedule for Black Walnuts\r\n\r\nDR. L. H. MacDANIELS, Chairman\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: During the year your committee has worked on the problem\r\nof setting up a judging schedule for black walnuts, mainly through\r\ncorrespondence. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to get together\r\nfor discussion. Had we done so, I'm sure we could have achieved close\r\nagreement upon essentials. As it is, there are several phases of the\r\nproblem upon which we would like the judgment of the association\r\nmembers. As far as this group here is concerned, I am quite sure that we\r\ncan't profitably go into a discussion of the various details and\r\nramifications of a judging schedule. I do think, however, that we might\r\ndiscuss the problem of whether our point of view in developing such a\r\nschedule should be that of the value of a variety for the commercial\r\nbuyer or for home use. As far as the committee is concerned, Mr. Chase\r\nfavors the home use angle. Clarence Reed and Mr. Stoke have not\r\nexpressed themselves definitely one way or the other. Mr. Stoke is here,\r\nand I expect that he will say something about it.\r\n\r\nI would like to open discussion on this question at this time, unless\r\nyou want to go back to the consideration of whether it is desirable or\r\npossible, to have any such schedule, at all. May we assume that this is\r\ndesirable?\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Could we have a double standard, one for the commercial\r\ngrower and one for the home grower?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: In my judgment it would be better to try one at a time.\r\n\r\nAnother schedule can be developed later.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Have you any particular preference, Dr. MacDaniels?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I personally feel that the new and improved varieties\r\nwill find their best use as a home proposition rather than in the\r\ncommercial orchard, because apparently with a modern cracker the common\r\nwild nuts can be cracked in pieces that are satisfactory for the\r\ncommercial trade, and crackability is of little moment.\r\n\r\nHave you any comments as to which point of view the committee should\r\ntake?\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I would like to inquire as to the purpose for which this\r\nnumerical score or method of evaluating these nuts is to be used. Is it\r\nto be used for show purposes, or is it for determining the value of a\r\nvariety of nut to grow?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: The purpose of setting up a schedule is to provide a\r\nstandard by which we can determine differences between samples in\r\ncontests, and to give a basis for comparison in determining the value of\r\na variety for growing in various climatic zones and of different\r\nvarieties grown in the same place. For instance, the variety, Thomas, in\r\none zone would be a very good nut and have a score of, say, 89. In\r\nanother it might have a score of only 45, and in another a score of 55.\r\nThe score would be directly related to the adaptability of this variety\r\nto a climatic zone or to a system of cultivation or to variation in any\r\nother environmental condition.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: How do the other members of the committee feel about it? What\r\nis their preference? It seems to me that if you are unanimous, all we\r\nhave to do is approve your report and leave out the discussion.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: We are not unanimous. Mr. Reed, who I regret is not\r\nhere, rather doubts that any kind of schedule is either possible or\r\ndesirable. Would you think that is a fair statement, Mr. Stoke?\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Yes.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Mr. Chase believes that a schedule is both possible and\r\ndesirable and that we should work along the general ideas advanced in\r\nthe paper on judging schedules published in the last volume of the\r\nreport. As I understand Mr. Stoke's position, he would go along with\r\nthat in general with possibly the addition of the factors of taste and\r\ncolor. Is that right?\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Yes, taste and color for domestic use.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I have already stated my position. I feel that unless we\r\nconfine the schedule to characteristics that can be weighed or measured\r\nsuccessfully its value and usefulness will be little.\r\n\r\nA Member: Dr. MacDaniels, if a man has a $20,000 machine for cracking\r\nwalnuts and he has a choice between the Thomas walnut and a good wild\r\none, he will pay a little bit more for Thomas walnuts, will he not?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: The question raised is that if a cracking plant which\r\ncracks thousands of pounds can get more kernels out of a hundred pounds\r\nof Thomas nuts or any other grafted variety, would the operators pay\r\nsomething more for them? I think undoubtedly they would, but would they\r\npay enough of a differential over the wild nuts to make it worthwhile to\r\nthe grower? I don't know.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: If you take pecans which are our best example, 95 per cent of\r\nall nuts produced in the United States are marketed as shelled kernels,\r\nand there is a very substantial price differential between seedlings and\r\nbudded pecans, and the crackers will pay the difference based on the\r\nyield of kernels. That is their only interest. The thickness of shell,\r\nhow well it cracks, or any other factor is of no importance. If the\r\nkernels are there, they will get them out.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: That is the crux of this whole matter. Are we interested\r\nin developing varieties for cracking in which we care little about the\r\nsize of the pieces recovered or about the ease of extraction, or do we\r\nwant nuts for home use that will give a high yield of large pieces?\r\nThese machines, as I understand it, will crack the walnuts and get the\r\nkernels out in small pieces regardless of how they crack in a Hershey\r\ncracker.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: As I understood Mr. Mullins, he favored having a lot of\r\nThomas if he could get them.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Would he pay the difference? I don't know. Dr. Crane\r\nsays he would.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: When I talked to him--we passed through there and\r\nsaw the plant--he said he thinks well enough of the better nuts to come\r\nhere for the purpose of learning where and how to manage a plantation of\r\nhis own of Thomas and the other budded varieties for his own cracking\r\nplant. In his own cracking plant the yield for the amount of labor\r\nexpended is so much better on the improved varieties that he wants to\r\nmake a planting of his own. He will pay more, but just how much more, I\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\nThat brings up another matter. As I have said before, our state\r\nauthorities should be urged again and again and again to buy _good_ seed\r\nnuts for distribution to the public so that we can get these better\r\nquality nuts into the woods. Some of them are agreeing to that. Some of\r\nthem are doing it. But so far not very much has been done.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think that before your committee goes ahead we must\r\nget a decision on this point, for the approaches are quite different. If\r\nyou are developing a schedule for home use, the size of the nuts is of\r\nimportance. In general, the bigger the nut the easier it is to handle,\r\nthe easier it is to shuck and crack. The percentage of kernel is\r\nrelatively less important than it is in the commercial cracking. The\r\nsize of the particles recovered is more important for home use. If they\r\ncome out easily and in large pieces, they are much more desirable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in commercial cracking the percentage of kernel is\r\nimportant. The commercial buyer wants to know how many pounds of kernels\r\ncan be expected from a hundred pounds of nuts. He is not much interested\r\nin the size of the nuts or the size of pieces that are recovered. This\r\nis an entirely different approach to the problem. We have got to decide\r\nbetween the two before the committee goes further.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: There is another angle to the problem. A lot of the black\r\nwalnuts today are used in the bakery trade and in the ice cream trade.\r\nBut I visualize a market for black walnut kernels to be eaten out of\r\nhand. There are many people in the United States that like the flavor of\r\nblack walnut kernels to eat in this way. I know I am one of them, and I\r\ndon't want to eat crumbs. I don't want to eat small pieces. I like to\r\nhave at least quarters.\r\n\r\nI think that if we were to gather from the status of our other native\r\nnut industry that there is going to be a premium paid for the larger\r\npieces, then cracking quality _would_ enter into the matter. Our pecans\r\nare sold on count of whole kernels per pound or per ounce. Almonds are\r\nsold the same way. Walnuts the same way--that is, Persian or English\r\nwalnuts. The number of kernels or pieces per pound is an important\r\nmatter, notwithstanding the situation as it exists in the black walnuts\r\ntoday. So I do think that we can't take the present status of the\r\nindustry as one which will prevail generally and in the future.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Would the majority report favor the side of the home consumer\r\nrather than the commercial buyer?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think it depends on what Mr. Stoke would think about\r\nthe majority. We didn't get a chance to get together, because Mr. Stoke\r\nwas so busy with exhibits.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: We might end by moving the adoption of the majority report\r\nand let it get at that.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: I know I brought up that matter of whether we should judge by\r\nstandards acceptable to the commercial buyer or to the ultimate\r\nconsumer. The confectioner doesn't care about the size or color at all.\r\nWhen they are put up in candy or in chocolate cookies, color doesn't\r\nmean anything. It's a black walnut, and it doesn't have to depend on\r\nanything else. So I think those two points of view are pertinent.\r\n\r\nI never expressed any preference, and I don't know that I have any. I\r\nthink it might be just as well to leave that up to this body. But the\r\nproducer, or those anticipating producing must be considered. Mr.\r\nHirschi can give us the word on marketing kernels.\r\n\r\nMr. Hirschi: I do not market kernels. I just crack the nuts and sell\r\nthem by the pound cracked.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Shell and all?\r\n\r\nMr. Hirschi: Shells and all. I sold about a ton and a half each winter\r\nfor the last four or five winters. They are Thomas walnuts. I get 35\r\ncents a pound with the horse shoe nail in the package.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: That man wants good color, good flavor, kernels easy to pick\r\nout, and of good size. That goes with the retail buyer. If the\r\ncommercial buyer gets 30 per cent kernels from good nuts compared with\r\n15 per cent from run-of-mine nuts, he doubtless will be willing to pay a\r\nconsiderable premium for the better nuts if he can get them. But unless\r\nthe good nuts are in considerable quantity they go right in with the\r\nothers and no more will be paid for them. That's my point of view. I\r\ndon't want to express my particular opinion, because I have no\r\nparticular opinion. But you might consider both, the commercial nut, and\r\nthe home nut.\r\n\r\nI think we might vote and determine what action, to take tonight as to\r\nsetting up a standard, or if you want to set up a double standard.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Mr. Mullins does get a better price for a larger kernel. He\r\nseparates them and treats them differently than the general run of small\r\npieces. It's been my observation that the cracking machines do a\r\nremarkably good job with the ordinary run of seedling nuts. Kenneth Dick\r\ngets the kernels out in rather large pieces, and from what we saw up at\r\nMullins' place he gets the same thing. He sifts out the larger pieces\r\nand gets a better price for them. So the preference is for the larger\r\npieces. It's like buying hamburger; you prefer your hamburger ground up\r\nout of larger pieces rather than odds and ends that the butcher has\r\naround the shop and grinds it up and hands it to you.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: But isn't it true that he sells the kernels in two separate\r\nclasses?\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: But the preference still seems to be, after we see them, for\r\nthe larger pieces. They have better kernels; otherwise, they would break\r\nup in small pieces.\r\n\r\nMr. Korn: I believe that as long as there are very few commercial\r\norchards, we should approach it from the angle of the people who have\r\njust a few pet nut trees around their yards, because I don't think the\r\ncommercial orchards of the improved grafted black walnuts are going to\r\nbe large enough to color the picture very much for a few years to come.\r\nAs long as they haven't been too profitable, I think it is going to be\r\nsome time before we have to worry much about commercial orchards.\r\nTherefore, we are interested in getting a superior product in kernel; it\r\nhas to be large, has to be of good color and good flavor. It seems to me\r\nthat would be one of the first things to consider. Then, if orchards get\r\nmore plentiful and profitable, we can take up the other angle.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a few remarks on this business\r\nof commercial cracking and large pieces that I hear mentioned by my good\r\nfriend, Mr. Weber. I had hoped to have the two largest shellers in the\r\ncountry present at these meetings, but was unable to get them here. In\r\nthis area the commercial walnut cracking industry is related directly to\r\nthe type of machinery necessary to recover the kernels. For example, the\r\ntwo or three cracking plants in Nashville handle an estimated ten\r\nmillion pounds of nuts each year and turn out roughly 1.2 million pounds\r\nof kernels. These kernels go directly to confectionary syrup and ice\r\ncream plants. Therefore, they are not interested in size of pieces. In\r\nfact, if they are too large, the commercial users have to chop them up.\r\nSo what we are doing here, ladies and gentlemen, is confusing what we\r\nwant to do in the way of judging nuts, it appears to me. There is little\r\nreason to assume that the Thomas, if they could get 10 million pounds of\r\nThomas, would be more valuable to the commercial crackers. But that\r\ndoesn't necessarily interfere with our judging system that we are trying\r\nto design to tell which nut is the best to grow.\r\n\r\nI specifically asked these buyers of millions of pounds of nuts: \"If I\r\ncame in with some Thomas nuts would I get some more money for them?\"\r\nTheir reply was, \"No, sir. We pay a flat rate per hundred pounds of\r\nnuts. We know that some of them are going to be excellent; we know some\r\nof them are going to be poor, but we intend to get from 12 to 15 per\r\ncent kernel recovery out of them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1940 we brought quantities of improved varieties to the cracking\r\nplant in Knoxville and ran them through Mr. Smalley's machine. He was\r\namazed. He didn't believe it; didn't believe his eyes. They came out in\r\nlarge pieces. But under present conditions they'd be chopped up. None of\r\nthese kernels moving out of Nashville vicinity go to retail trade,\r\nexcept a few that go to confectionary stores in 25-pound boxes and are\r\nsold a pound at a time for cooking purposes, not for eating out of the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nPeople like Mr. Korn and Mr. Hirschi, who are interested in selling\r\nkernels at a much higher price than the commercial crackers, have to\r\nhave large pieces, attractive kernels, properly cared for, properly\r\ncolored, and of mild flavor. Is it this group we are trying to assist by\r\nthis judging system or the commercial cracker?\r\n\r\nThe number of acres planted with Thomas sufficient to yield enough nuts\r\nto operate one of these machines would be tremendous. There are several\r\nexamples of where the machine has been purchased to be used on Thomas\r\nbut hasn't been used. It has been stored away. They prefer to crack the\r\nThomas nuts by hand.\r\n\r\nSo my point is this: It appears to me that we are interested in the\r\ngrower of several trees around the farmstead. At least, in this section\r\nwe are. Everyone here gathers and cracks walnuts. Our idea of\r\nacquainting them with the Thomas variety is to make their job easier in\r\ncracking and picking them out. It seems to me that's also the problem\r\nthat we have as a group elsewhere, and I believe that in order for us to\r\nmake headway on this judging schedule, which I think is necessary and\r\ndesirable, we must view it from the home viewpoint at this time. That\r\ndoes not shut out the commercial viewpoint for later years. But now we\r\nare primarily interested in the home raising of nuts, unless I am in the\r\nwrong group. Thank you.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Mr. Chairman, I agree heartily with what Mr. Chase has to\r\nsay, or otherwise we might as well quit now and raise seedling nuts to\r\nthe best of our ability and sell them to the commercial crackers and let\r\nit go at that. But, if we do that, what's the use of searching out\r\nbetter varieties?\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: Mr. Chairman: I believe that if a nut acceptable to the home\r\nconsumer, one which extracts easily and is attractive and palatable and\r\nis productive--if that type of nut is scored and comes to the attention\r\nof a sufficient number of growers, then I think the commercial people\r\n_will_ utilize it. So I don't believe there is anything to this\r\nargument. I believe if you go ahead on the basis of the home consumer\r\nand develop a nut that will be desirable for his purpose, and if in\r\naddition to these factors that have been discussed it is adaptable and\r\nproductive, then it is going to be eventually the nut that the\r\ncommercial man will utilize, because, after all, what we are growing\r\nnuts for is the kernel.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: To bring it to a head, I move that we adopt that part of the\r\nreport that favors the home consumer as against the commercial consumer,\r\nor we will be here all night talking about it.\r\n\r\nDr. Rohrbacher: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: You have heard the motion, which was seconded. Any\r\nremarks?\r\n\r\n(Vote taken on the motion, carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: That will be the basis on which the committee will work.\r\n\r\nThere are several other points to be considered. I would suggest the\r\ncommittee be asked to make further tests with the schedule as proposed\r\nin order to get additional data to determine if it is a usable schedule\r\nand can be used by different people with reasonably similar results, and\r\nif it does differentiate the things that we want to have a schedule\r\ndifferentiate in a test.\r\n\r\nThis last year we had hoped to do this, but there weren't enough samples\r\nof nuts available to be worth testing. I spent about $10 personally\r\nbuying nuts from this source and that, and there wasn't a good sample in\r\nthe lot, except one, which Sterling Smith gave me.\r\n\r\nI think that if we have another season to work the schedule that has\r\nbeen proposed, we at least can demonstrate whether or not it is\r\ndifferentiating between varieties in a manner which is satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI believe a motion is in order to bring this matter to a decision and\r\nend this discussion. Have you any further comment, Mr. Chase?\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: If it is not out of order, I move that we adopt for further\r\ntrial, the scoring schedule proposed in the paper by Dr. Atwood and Dr.\r\nMacDaniels in the 1947 Report of the Northern Nut Growers Association.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I second the motion.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: May I make one remark? Does not that schedule ignore the\r\nfactors of color and taste?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: It does, as not being objective characters.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: In other words, this motion approves something from the\r\ncommercial slant rather than from the personal use slant.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I wouldn't say that; it simply limits the judging\r\nschedule to those characteristics which can be objectively handled and\r\nare not a matter of opinion or judgment. That's the point here, I think.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Stoke and I don't quite agree--I don't think we are the\r\nonly two--on flavor and color. However, in our exchange of\r\ncorrespondence we fully appreciate the advantage of light-colored,\r\nmild-flavored kernels. But I don't see any method by which we can place\r\na numerical value on the color and flavor. Can we not describe the color\r\nand flavor along with the rating that describes the kernel and still\r\nhave you on our side?\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Personally, I think we are splitting hairs. When we can't\r\nagree as to which color class a sample belongs, it must be somewhere\r\nnear the border-line. Ordinarily the average human being will agree\r\npretty well as to a blonde or a brunette or one that's neutral. And I\r\nthink in the judging of walnuts, there can be no exact value based on\r\nthe color. If you consider color and make a scientific test, your test\r\nwouldn't be the same as my test. But if it is a dark kernel, you can\r\nrecognize it, and so can I, if we have any common sense.\r\n\r\nAlso in the matter of flavor, you and I can tell what we like and what\r\nwe don't like. And I think there are those two limitations. We can't do\r\nthis scientifically, because the human factor is here. But after all,\r\nit's humans that eat them and produce them for eating! And I rather, in\r\nthe schedules last year, brought up objections to it. I didn't say I\r\nobjected, and, of course, I don't now.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I'd like to just say this, and I am going to call on my good\r\nfriend, J. C. McDaniel here, for agreement. A long time ago we prepared,\r\ndid we not, various judging systems?\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: We found that--you can correct me if this is wrong--by\r\nmanipulating five points for flavor and five points given for color we\r\ncould change the position of a variety of a list a great deal, and we\r\nalso found that the points given for color were not related to\r\ninherently bad color but simply the result of poor handling, which also\r\naffects flavor. This is my reason for eliminating color and flavor from\r\nthe schedule: it is _not_ to get away from the mild-flavored,\r\npretty-colored kernels.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Mr. Chairman, I must say that I am inclined to agree\r\nwith Mr. Stoke, for this reason: Even though color and flavor are very\r\nfrequently the result of poor handling, we all know that we will say\r\nthat the Stabler has the characteristic that is distinctive of quickly\r\ncoloring up and quickly becoming rancid as distinguished from the\r\nThomas, which does not. Now, those things are inherent in the two\r\nvarieties, I think, and I don't think this committee should ignore\r\naltogether the matter of color and flavor, although I do think, perhaps,\r\nnot so much weight might be given to those two qualities as had been\r\ngiven to them in the past. But they certainly decidedly influence the\r\nmarketability for kernels from the point of view of home consumption. I\r\nthink there is no question about that. I should be inclined to agree\r\nwith Mr. Stoke, that those two qualities should not be ignored by the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think the point would be to ignore them in their\r\nsimply not being objective; you can't weigh or measure them. There is a\r\nmotion properly seconded before the house. Are there further remarks?\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Wouldn't there be just a certain amount of trial and error\r\nconnected with it, and as you go along you will either add to or take\r\noff, and then you will get a correct system of judging? You have to\r\nstart out with one system and if it is wrong, change it.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I think it's a matter of doing something rather than\r\nnothing, for a schedule is always subject to improvement.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: I wish to point out we have made some tests together, and\r\nyour personal tests and my personal tests ran very close together.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: That is right.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: And one member of the committee is always very conservative\r\nand his tests never run as high on any series as the others. I make a\r\ntest and he makes a test, and his are always lower. Maybe, he doesn't\r\nrecover as much; perhaps he isn't as expert a cracker. (Vote taken on\r\nthe motion; carried.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Let us adjourn until 8:30 tomorrow morning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+A Picture from Our Most \"Northern\" Member+\r\n\r\nJohn Davidson wrote in our 1943 report: \"If any man deserves a bright\r\nNNGA medal, it is A. L. Young, of Brooks, Alberta.\" By planting his\r\ntrees near enough to irrigation ditches in his \"desert, cactus country,\"\r\nand protecting them from livestock, Mr. Young is able to get nuts on the\r\nhardier trees, but he reported that the nuts, \"while of fair size, do\r\nnot have fleshy kernels ... Butternuts are very sweet with fair size\r\nkernels ... Giant hickory from Ontario seems hardy but particular about\r\nthe kind of soil ... Carpathian walnuts killed back quite a lot, so did\r\nmost of my hybrid walnuts ... Some Manchurian walnuts ... got a setback\r\nwith spring frosts ... Heartnuts got a rough deal last winter\r\n[1942-43.]\" Mr. Young wrote to Dr. J. Russell Smith in 1948: \"I have\r\nbeen using pollen of Broadview and Carpathian [Persian walnuts] on my\r\nblacks and while there are a lot of hybrid seedlings, none have fruited\r\nyet. On Peace River hazel [far Northern] I have been using Barcelona, Du\r\nChilly and Gellatly pollen. Some of these hybrids look good, hardy, and\r\nproduce good nuts ... A few varieties of oak are promising and\r\nfruiting.\"\r\n\r\nAt his location, Mr. Young expects winter temperature of -45 deg., and the\r\nlowest known [before 1940] was -62 deg.F. Summer temperatures go above\r\n100 deg.F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fruiting black walnut grown at Brooks, Alberta, Canada,\r\nby member A. L. Young. The seed came from Ontario.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tuesday Morning Session+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The only way to get started is to start. We are\r\ngoing to be given a look at the honeylocust situation in the South by\r\nProfessor Moore of the Department of Horticulture of the Alabama\r\nPolytechnic Institute of Auburn. Mr. Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Present Outlook for Honeylocust in the South\r\n\r\nJ. C. MOORE, Department of Horticulture, Alabama Polytechnic Institute,\r\nAuburn, Alabama\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Before I start this\r\ndiscussion, just in case some of you are not familiar with honeylocust,\r\nits habit of growth, the size of the pods and the possibility of its\r\nyield, I'd like to take time out just to show a few slides, then I will\r\ngo ahead with the discussion and give you some data on that honeylocust\r\nproduction. I believe if you would look at these slides before we start\r\nthe discussion it would give you a good idea what the tree looks like,\r\nhow it grows, the age at which it starts bearing and something about its\r\ngeneral habits; it will help you a lot to understand what I have to say\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n(Slides shown.)\r\n\r\nThis is the Millwood honeylocust. The pods will vary in size from about\r\n12 inches to 14 inches in length, from one and a half to one and\r\nthree-quarters inches in width, and the back part of the pod, something\r\nthat I can't show on this particular type of picture, is very thick, and\r\nthis back part of the pod, the thick part of it, is very rich in\r\ncarbohydrates. We have the Calhoun and Millwood selections that have run\r\nas high, the Millwood a little over 36 per cent sugar and the Calhoun a\r\nlittle over 38 per cent sugar. The Millwood is a much higher yielding\r\ntree than the Calhoun. I will bring that out in a few minutes' time.\r\n\r\nThis is a borrowed slide and I don't know the history of these trees,\r\nbut I judge that the tree is about three years old. We have had good\r\nyields on three-year-old trees at Auburn.\r\n\r\nHere is a group of trees growing with a ground cover, and again I am not\r\nfamiliar with the ground cover, but just judging from the general\r\nappearance it looks like a picture that came from our files. If that is\r\ntrue then I know the story. The tree in the background is a Calhoun tree\r\nand the tree in the foreground is a Millwood growing in _Lespedeza\r\nsericea_ and I will bring out some points in a few minutes in the\r\ngeneral discussion on the value of these two plants growing together as\r\na combination.\r\n\r\nI believe this is another tree that grew on my farm, and the year this\r\npicture was made this particular tree, eight years of age, bore 250\r\npounds of those luscious pods.\r\n\r\nA close-up again, giving you the general size of the pod, how they are\r\nproduced in masses, and you get quite a bit of weight in some of those\r\nthick-backed pods that you don't get from the thin pods that grow\r\nnormally on seedling trees. The TVA has done quite a bit of work in\r\nselecting and developing the honeylocust, and I believe we give that\r\nparticular organization credit for the development of both the Millwood\r\nand the Calhoun.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be very valuable to give you just a glimpse of the\r\nhabit of growth of those trees before I start with my general discussion\r\nso that you would understand something about what I am talking about.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Are these thornless?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: These are thornless honeylocusts. The original parent trees\r\nof the Millwood and Calhoun had thorns. By vegetative propagation--they\r\nwent out and cut scionwood on the limbs above the thorns and propagated\r\nthe thornless twigs on thornless root stock--we now have a thornless\r\nhoneylocust.\r\n\r\nThere has been quite a bit of disturbance in Alabama, especially in the\r\nnorthern part of the state, caused by native honeylocust. We have two or\r\nthree characteristics that I think ought to be brought out about\r\nhoneylocust. Some of out trees in the northern part of the state of\r\nAlabama have triple thorns. It is known as _G. triacanthos_ and the\r\n\"tri-\" part of that particular word, of course, gives us an idea of\r\nthree thorns, and I have seen thorns at least 12 inches long that you\r\ncould catch in your hand and use for a dagger, and it would be very\r\ndangerous. Now, some of those trees growing in the northern part of the\r\nstate are very serious pests in pastures. Cows and horses and hogs are\r\nvery fond of those lucious pods, and they will go around the trees and\r\npick up every pod that falls, and occasionally a horse or cow will get\r\nclose enough to the trunk of the tree and get speared with those thorns,\r\nand when the thorn pierces the skin there is a little tip on the end\r\nthat breaks off and is left inside. When the usual infection that it\r\ncarries get started from the part of the thorn that is left in the\r\nflesh, you get pus and, of course, later on the amputation of the leg,\r\nif it happens to be in the leg, of the horse. With the thornless type\r\nthat is completely eliminated.\r\n\r\nThen this other thing that I think ought to be brought out, the\r\nthornless or near-thornless type as a general rule has a better quality\r\nof pods than the ones with the long thorns. Now, it is true that the\r\nparent seedling trees of the Calhoun and the Millwood both had a small\r\nquantity of thorns when they were growing wild. After they were\r\npropagated vegetatively the thorns, of course, were eliminated by taking\r\nscion wood from above the thorns. But in general in our state, the\r\nthornless trees--and we do have a lot of thornless trees growing\r\nwild--have a higher sugar content in the pods than do the trees with\r\nthorns.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to give you a general idea of what we have done with\r\nhoneylocust in Alabama. In 1938 the TVA sent down some Millwood and\r\nCalhoun for test planting. We put those trees in two different types of\r\nplanting. We had an integrated planting where we were trying to select\r\nat that time some good pasture plants, and, of course, we had something\r\nlike a hundred different species in the one planting. The trees were\r\nplanted relatively thick, but the larger trees were planted longer\r\ndistances apart, and the intermediate trees intermediate distances\r\napart, and then we had shrubs coming in under those. It was supposed to\r\nhave been a three-story type of planting, black walnut in the upper\r\nstory, honeylocust as an intermediate and shrubs for the ground. We were\r\nusing different types of plums for the understory; then on the ground we\r\nhad _Lespedeza sericea_. But from that we did get several different\r\nplant materials that did look promising, and we put the Calhoun\r\nhoneylocust and the Millwood honeylocust in with that planting for\r\ntrial, and they did so well that we expanded the honeylocust into\r\nanother planting. I am very sorry that this latter planting had to be\r\ntaken out.\r\n\r\nHillculture research went under in June of 1947, and the Horticulture\r\nDepartment took this work over, and they thought they could not support\r\nthe honeylocust pasture program in Horticulture, and the plot, of\r\ncourse, was pulled out and planted in peaches.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we do have some information I'd like to give you. The Dairy\r\nDepartment of the Alabama Experiment Station carried out quite an\r\nextensive feeding test over a two-year period to find out the value of\r\nthese pods in the dairy ration. They substituted the honeylocust pods\r\nground. Professor Eaton of the Dairy Department assures me that none of\r\nthe seeds in those pods were cracked. They ground the pods with corn in\r\norder to take up some of the excess honey that is in the back of these\r\npods so that they'd grind well, and they ground them in a hammermill,\r\nand the burrs were running far enough apart so that he assures me that\r\nvery few of the seeds, if any, were ever cracked.\r\n\r\nThat has been somewhat of a discussion, among feed producers especially,\r\nrecently, as to whether or not it would be profitable to grind those\r\nseeds in order to get the protein and fats that the seed has. There\r\nisn't a very high percentage of food in the seed itself, but you do get\r\na little more protein and a little more fat if you grind the seed\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWe have found in storage that weevils get in these seeds, but the weevil\r\ndoesn't destroy the carbohydrates, and the weevil will only pierce the\r\nseed and make a hole in it. Then the intestinal juices of a cow will go\r\nin through this hole and they can digest the seed. That is something\r\nthat comes along with storage.\r\n\r\nI'd like to give you just something briefly on what the Dairy Department\r\nof Alabama Polytechnic found out about the general value of these pods.\r\nThey found that honeylocust pods could be substituted in a dairy ration\r\nfor oats, pound for pound. Now, that means that if you can get a high\r\nyield of honeylocust pods and substitute it in a dairy ration for oats\r\nthat you just about have half of the grain problem solved.\r\n\r\nI'd like then to follow that up to give you the average yields. Before I\r\ngive you these average yields I'd also like to bring out this fact about\r\nthe Calhoun and the Millwood honeylocust. Those trees are very peculiar\r\nin their habits of bearing. One year they will bear a heavy crop. The\r\nnext year they will bear scarcely anything. They are definitely\r\nalternate bearing, and I think that alternate bearing has a\r\nphysiological background behind it. How We can eliminate that\r\nphysiological reaction is something else. But the years that the trees\r\nare heavily loaded with the fruit the amount of carbohydrates that it\r\ndraws from the tree is so great that the tree doesn't have enough\r\ncarbohydrates left to produce fruit the next year. I think it is the\r\ncarbon-nitrogen ratio from the physiological standpoint, and, of course,\r\nif that is the case, then there is a possibility that you could\r\neliminate or correct that carbon-nitrogen ratio by thinning during the\r\nblooming period. But when you see these results I think that you will\r\nagree that honeylocust has a place, even if they do bear only every\r\nother year.\r\n\r\nIn our planting we have some trees that will bear this year. Next year\r\nthey won't bear, but their sister trees will bear. So we have pods every\r\nyear from some of the trees. Over a period of five years, during which\r\nthese trees were planted (the oldest trees that we have in 1938, and in\r\n1942) the average production of the Millwood was 58.3 pounds per tree.\r\nIn 1943 there were no pods produced on the Millwood variety. We had a\r\ncold spell in the spring that completely eradicated all of the fruit in\r\nthat year. In 1944 the average yield--and that is taking the average\r\nyield of 10 trees of the oldest ones that were put in--the average yield\r\nwas 146 pounds of pods per tree.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: That's for both varieties?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: That's just for Millwood. I will give you the Calhoun in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nThen in 1945 the average yield was 39.5 pounds per tree. In 1946 we had\r\nan average of 180 pounds per tree. In 1947 we had an average of 12\r\npounds. Now, note the break there in averages from year to year: 58,\r\nnone, 146, 39, 180, 12. You get from that that we have almost definitely\r\nalternate bearing in those trees.\r\n\r\nNow, this other thing is interesting. If you take the five-year average\r\nfrom 1942 through 1946 inclusive, and convert that to 35 trees--this is\r\n10 trees--but when you convert that to an average of 35 trees per acre\r\nyou get the equivalent of 92 bushels of oats per acre. Now, understand,\r\nwith this yield of pods we were cutting two and a half tons of hay from\r\nthe _Lespedeza sericea_ each year. So we were getting our hay crop and\r\nour grain crop from the same source.\r\n\r\nNow, to give you just briefly what the Calhoun variety did during those\r\nyears, in 1942 the Calhoun trees--the same age planted under the same\r\nconditions on the same soil--averaged 26.4 pounds of pods per tree. In\r\n1943 the Calhoun followed closely with the Millwood; on account of a\r\nfreeze they didn't produce anything. In 1944 they produced 32.4 pounds\r\nof pods per tree. In 1945 they produced 63.8 pounds of pods per tree. In\r\n1946 they produced 22 pounds of pods per tree, and in 1947 they produced\r\n46 pounds of pods per tree.\r\n\r\nNow, if you will take the average of those, contrast it with the average\r\nfor the Millwood, you will find that the Millwood tree over a period of\r\nfive years produced almost three times as many pods as the Calhoun. The\r\nCalhoun variety has a little more carbohydrates, and it always averages\r\na little more sugar per pound than the Millwood, but the additional\r\nyield of the Millwood variety makes it very worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI have done quite a bit of work on the blooming habits or the fruiting\r\nhabits of the honeylocust over a number of years, and I find that there\r\nis quite a variation there in the individual trees. Some trees are\r\ntypically males. They never bear anything, but they have staminate\r\ncatkins. Others are typically females, never bearing anything but the\r\npistillate flowers. Then we have an integration there of perfect trees.\r\nI know of one tree in Blount County, Alabama that for nine years never\r\nmissed a crop. It had perfect flowers, or rather, both pistillate and\r\nstaminate flowers on the same tree. However, the flowers were borne on\r\nseparate catkins, the pistillate flowers, catkins, coming out on the\r\nsame node with the male and producing the pod. So you do have a large\r\nvariation in the fruiting habits, and we have found those variations on\r\nMillwood selections and on Calhoun selections, even though they were\r\nvegetatively propagated.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we can take a bud off a female Millwood and put it onto a\r\nroot stock and get a male tree I can't figure out, but they seem to act\r\nthat way in that respect. I have had a Millwood tree that never bore\r\nanything but male flowers.[18] That is something for someone else to\r\nfigure out. I can't explain it.\r\n\r\nJust briefly I'd like to give you the observational work that we have\r\ndone with honeylocust. For mules in a feeding test we fed a team of\r\nmules for 30 days nothing but honeylocust and hay, and these mules were\r\nin fine shape when they came out at the end of the feeding test. You say\r\nthat's an awfully short feeding test. It is, but we had very few pods.\r\nThen for cows I have gone into it more extensively. I have a cow myself,\r\nand I have fed that cow honeylocust pods and that was all the grain she\r\nhad through the winter months, and got excellent milk production. You\r\nget excellent milk flavor from these pods and an increase in milk\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nA very interesting thing happened. I went out in the community to gather\r\npods from the wild trees for a feeding test, and there was a lady who\r\nowned a farm pretty close to our project. I went over and talked with\r\nher about getting the pods from her trees to feed to my cows for feeding\r\ntests, and it was O. K. But when I left she got to thinking the thing\r\nover, and she decided that if honeylocust pods were good for my cow they\r\nwould be good for her cow! So I went back in a few days' time--the pods\r\nweren't mature when I went the first time. I went back in a few days and\r\nI didn't ask the lady if I could get the pods, I just stopped on the\r\nside of the road and we put a darky up in the tree to shake the pods\r\noff. And we saw a little darky coming across the field, just a streak.\r\nHe said, \"Missus says come over to the house.\" I went over there, and\r\nshe was just a little bit embarrassed, but she said, \"Mr. Moore, I have\r\ndecided if honeylocust was good for the goose it was good for the\r\ngander, so I have been feeding honeylocust to my cows.\" And she went on\r\nwith that story and said that she had been selling milk to a fraternity\r\nover in town, and the boys at the fraternity, after she had fed the cows\r\nhoneylocust for a week or two, asked her what had happened to her milk,\r\nand she told them--she said honestly she was afraid she was going to\r\nlose the trade, she thought something bad was wrong with it. She told\r\nthem, that so far as she knew there wasn't anything. They said, \"Have\r\nyou done anything to it?\" \"No, we haven't.\" They said, \"Well, it's the\r\nbest milk we have ever had, and we can tell the difference in the\r\ntaste.\" And then she told them what she had done. She wouldn't tell them\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nNow, we have had story after story coming to us to corroborate that.\r\nNow, I have never seen with my cow any difference in milk flavor, either\r\ngood or bad, but my wife can definitely tell, and she is very particular\r\nabout her butter, because she likes to sell that. I can quit feeding\r\nhoneylocust a few days, and my wife will say, \"How come you quit feeding\r\nhoneylocust to the cow?\" It is that definite.\r\n\r\nThere are two things I want to mention: The value of a combination of a\r\nperennial ground cover with your honeylocust tree, and then I want to\r\nmention the fact that honeylocust _planted_ in a pasture will give no\r\nbenefit whatsoever. You are going to have to grow your honeylocust on\r\nthe outside, harvest the pods and feed them just like you would corn, or\r\nyou are going to have to plant your honeylocust on a barren hillside\r\nsomeplace that doesn't grow anything else--and I think honeylocust will\r\ngrow with a little fertilizer on about the poorest soil you have, the\r\nmost eroded soil you have, with a little care--then pasture it after\r\nyour trees are large enough so that the cow won't eat the limbs. There\r\nis something about the tree itself that a cow loves. They will chew the\r\nbark and chew the limbs right down to the main trunk.\r\n\r\nWe have tried planting those trees at four years of age, even, in\r\npastures, and we just can't get them to survive. In fact, the cows and\r\nthe mules in our pasture ate the trees down to the stumps in the\r\nwintertime before they ever started putting out leaves in the spring. So\r\nit has been a problem. (See Dr. Diller's pasture tree-guard paper in\r\nthis report.--Ed.)\r\n\r\nThis value that you can get from growing honeylocust and _Lespedeza\r\nsericea_ on the same soil is the same as with honeylocust and alfalfa if\r\nyou are in the alfalfa belt, or something like that with other perennial\r\nlegumes. These are the benefits that I think you can get from a\r\ncombination: In the first place, the soil is completely protected. In\r\nthe second place, a concentrate and hay can be grown on the same\r\nacreage. Third, a good grazing and feeding out program can be\r\nmaintained. If you plant your honeylocust on a hillside someplace and\r\nlet the trees get large enough so that the cows won't eat them up, have\r\nyour ground cover established, by the time that you are ready to pasture\r\nit you can put your cattle in. We had this combination, and I think it\r\nwould have worked out very well if it had not been destroyed. We had our\r\n_Lespedeza sericea_ for our summer grazing crop; then we had winter\r\nannuals planted in the _Lespedeza sericea_ for our winter grazing, and\r\nthe honeylocust was the fattening crop or finishing-off crop.\r\n\r\nWhat we had planned to do was turn the cattle in on this last plot about\r\nJanuary 1st, let them graze crimson clover, or bur clover, or any other\r\nwinter ground cover that grows in your section until the _Lespedeza\r\nsericea_ came on in the early summer. Then they'd graze the _Lespedeza\r\nsericea_ till the honeylocust pods started falling in the fall, and\r\nthey'd fatten off on the honeylocust, and you'd put them on the market\r\njust before the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nThen fourth, the management cost is very low. Fifth, the weed problems\r\nin your pasture are controlled. Sixth, you get maximum production from\r\nthe soil. You get your grain and your hay from the same piece of land.\r\n\r\nNow, that's all that I plan to give on this subject. There may be some\r\nquestions come up that we can discuss later.\r\n\r\nA Member: What is the sugar content?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: The sugar content of the Calhoun pods is around 38 per cent,\r\nin the Millwood about 36 per cent.\r\n\r\nA Member: Is it different in the two varieties?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Not very much, only about 2 per cent different.\r\n\r\nA Member: What spacing do you use in planting?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: 35 by 35 feet is about the correct spacing.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher: What is your labor problem? You say this is equal to oats.\r\nCan you run a combine over the field and harvest in one operation?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: This one you don't harvest at all. The cow picks them up off\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nA Member: If you had a few hundred trees, would these pods all come on\r\nat one time, or you mentioned having somebody shake them off. Can you\r\npick them all up at one time?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Yes, you can shake them all off at one time, rake them all up\r\nwith the rake, take a pitchfork rake, carry them to the barn and throw\r\nthem in storage in a dry place. You don't have to worry about weevils.\r\n\r\nA Member: Store them like hay?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: Hay or corn. I have some that have been stored for three\r\nyears, and the weevil gets into the seed, but it doesn't seem to affect\r\nit. My cattle like three-year-old pods as well as the new ones--well,\r\nthey like them better.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Do the pods heat up?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: They won't heat up, if they aren't green.\r\n\r\nA Member: What about the protein content?\r\n\r\nMr. Moore: I will give you the analysis for that, the complete analysis\r\nof ground honeylocust pods. That might be interesting. Moisture content,\r\n12.47. Ash, 3.14. Crude protein, 8.58. Now, the crude protein has run as\r\nhigh as 14 per cent. I want to bring that out. This was pods collected\r\nin the wild, and this was a sample that the State Chemist ran for us on\r\nthat. Fats 2.12. Fiber, 17.73. Carbohydrates total 55.96.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I am afraid we will have to close this if we are to\r\nget on at all. That's the most authoritative information we have ever\r\nhad, I think, in this Association about honeylocust. I am sure we have\r\nbeen enjoying it and have been benefited by it immensely.\r\n\r\nOn the possibilities of filbert growing in Virginia, Dr. Overholser will\r\nnow give you a talk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: According to botanical authorities, the honey locust is\r\npolygamo-dioecious; that is, it generally has most of its male flowers\r\non one tree and most of the female flowers on another tree, but the\r\ntrees are not 100 per cent pure in this sex division. In my personal\r\nobservations of flowers on grafted trees, including Millwood and Calhoun\r\nand scores of seedlings, both \"male\" and \"female,\" I never found any\r\npollen produced in flowers of the \"female\" trees, but nearly all \"male\"\r\ntrees in the Tennessee Valley will have occasional catkins with one or\r\nmore perfect flowers near their terminal ends (the basal flowers being\r\nstaminate on the same catkin.) The functionally perfect flowers on such\r\n\"male\" trees have been observed to set from one to many pods in certain\r\nyears, but such pods are generally small as compared with those borne on\r\n\"female\" trees in the same locality, and I have never observed a heavy\r\npod crop on any \"male\" tree. Grafted trees of Millwood and Calhoun\r\nselections in Tennessee were observed to set pistillate flowers, but no\r\npods (or very few) matured on them unless there was a \"male\" tree in\r\nflower within insect-flight distance from them. (At Auburn, Alabama,\r\nthere were wild honeylocusts, including \"male\" trees, within a half-mile\r\nof the Hillculture planting of grafted honeylocusts when I saw it in\r\n1943.)\r\n\r\nI do not argue that no pollen is ever produced by Millwood or Calhoun\r\nflowers some probably is (though its demonstration might require almost\r\nmicroscopic examination, in contrast with the easy finding of pods on\r\n\"male\" trees.) But, in the practical culture of fruiting honeylocusts,\r\nand in our present scope of knowledge of their pollination requirements,\r\nour plantings should include a handful of seedling (thornless) trees or\r\nelse some grafted trees of a thornless \"male\" selection such as the\r\nSmith, in a ratio of about 1 Smith to 10, say, of Millwood.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the presumed male mutants of the fruiting\r\nvarieties, reported above by Mr. Moore, were destroyed when the\r\nHillculture plots at Auburn were discontinued. Perhaps similar ones will\r\nshow up elsewhere, and they will be worth looking for. Meanwhile, the\r\nSmith variety (originally propagated through a mixup in scionwood\r\ncollection), has been demonstrated to be a satisfactory pollinator for\r\nMillwood and Calhoun, and it, as grafted, is also a thornless tree.\r\nPerhaps any thornless male seedling honeylocust tree, if its flowering\r\nperiod coincides with that of the fruiting variety, might serve equally\r\nwell.--Note by J. C. McDaniel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibilities of Filbert Growing in Virginia\r\n\r\nE. L. OVERHOLSER, Head, Department of Horticulture, V. P. I.,\r\nBlacksburg, Virginia\r\n\r\nMore than four-fifths of the United States filberts are grown in Oregon\r\nand nearly all the rest are produced in the State of Washington. Prior\r\nto 1933, total filbert production in these two states did not exceed 500\r\ntons, but production has since increased steadily and in 1945 it\r\namounted to 5,320 tons. The value of filbert production in the U. S. in\r\n1945 was about 3 million dollars.[1]\r\n\r\nAs a wild hazel is native of Virginia and as filberts have been\r\nprofitably grown, especially in Oregon and Washington the question is\r\noften raised as to whether hazelnuts or filberts could not be grown\r\ncommercially in Virginia. It has been suggested that if varieties now\r\navailable are not successfull in Virginia, perhaps new varieties may be\r\noriginated by crossing, including inter-specific crosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n+American Species+\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HAZEL. As mentioned, one species, _Corylus americana_ Walt., is\r\nnative to much of Virginia. Its distribution is from the northeastern\r\nstates and Canada to Saskatchewan and the Dakotas and south to Florida\r\nand the Gulf of Mexico. Its adaptation is much wider than that of the\r\nbeaked hazels (_C. cornuta_ Marsh or _C. roxtrata_ Ait. and the far\r\nwestern _C. californica_) the two other Corylus species native to the\r\nUnited States and Canada. This native _americana_, species appears at\r\nleast to have value from the point of view of soil conservation, as food\r\nfor wild life, and for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\nThe American hazel is a large thicket-forming shrub, which sprouts very\r\nfreely after cutting, and the foliage is generally dense. It is found\r\ngrowing on dry, well-drained sites, in both sun and shade. It, however,\r\nseldom bears fruit in the shade. The shrub is relatively hardy,\r\nwithstanding mid-winter temperatures of -40 deg. to -30 deg.F. and is easily\r\ntransplanted.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are available in the wild from July through September and\r\noccasionally persistent on the plant until December or even February.\r\nThe nuts average about 250 per pound, with a germination of about 80\r\npercent, producing about 60 usable plants per pound of seed.\r\n\r\nThree of the best known varieties of _C. americana_ are the Rush from\r\nPennsylvania, the Littlepage from Indiana, and the Winkler (most hardy)\r\nfrom Iowa. [See footnote following.--Ed.][19]\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Thomas Jefferson in his list of plants native to Virginia,\r\nas published in his _Notes on the State of Virginia_, which was written\r\nin 1781, and published in 1782, in 1784-1785, and in 1787, lists among\r\nother plants the \"Hazelnut (_Corylus Avellana_)\", which apparently\r\nshould have been called _Corylus americana_ Walters.\r\n\r\n_Breeding Filberts in the East._ This brings up the question of filbert\r\nbreeding in the East. Crane and Wood (1937) have fully reviewed the\r\nbreeding program with filberts, and the breeding of filberts, for the\r\nEast may be briefly referred to here. Tho pollen from _C. californica_\r\nand _C. americana_ apparently does not function on the pistillate\r\nflowers of European varieties, (_Corylus avellana_ L. and _C. maxima_).\r\nSince however, _C. americana_ is useful as a pistillate parent, it is\r\npossible that _C. californica_ may be similarly used.\r\n\r\nThe workers of the United States Bureau of Plant Industry are primarily\r\ntesting first-generation hybrids resulting from crosses with the\r\npistillate parents Rush,[20] Littlepage, and Winkler of _C. americana_\r\nand pollen from varieties of _C. avellana_ native of Europe, northern\r\nAfrica, and western Asia, and of _C. maxima_, the filbert of\r\nsoutheastern Europe and western Asia. Other pollen parents were _C.\r\ncolurna_, (Turkish hazel, native of southeastern Europe and western\r\nAsia) and _C. heterophylla_ Fisch., (various leaved hazel from eastern\r\nAsia.)\r\n\r\nCrane and Wood (1937) suggest that varieties of high merit should be\r\ndeveloped for home plantings over much of the region from lower New\r\nEngland and Great Lakes on the north, and to the Potomac and Arkansas\r\nRivers on the south, and that much of Wisconsin, southern Minnesota,\r\nSouth Dakota, and Nebraska might also be included.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane writes, by letter dated July 27, 1948, that he has as a result\r\nof breeding work, which was started many years ago, two new varieties\r\nthat have been placed in the hands of nurserymen for multiplication.\r\nThese varieties are at the present time carried under the numbers of\r\n1667 and 2336, These are hybrids between the European filbert (_Corylus\r\navellana_ L.) and the native American hazelnut (_C. americana._) At the\r\nPlant Industry Station at Beltsville, Maryland, these two varieties have\r\nbeen outstanding in their yielding ability, hardiness, and quality of\r\nnuts produced. Dr. Crane does not think, however, that these varieties\r\nmay very materially change the situation as regards commercial filbert\r\ngrowing in the East and in the South.\r\n\r\nBecause of the conditions prevailing during the last war, nurserymen\r\nhave not made as much progress, in propagating these new varieties as\r\nhad been originally hoped. Dr. Crane plans to release these varieties\r\nfor extensive plantings just as soon as there are sufficient plants in\r\nthe hands of the nurserymen to warrant their being called to the\r\nattention of the general public.\r\n\r\nHILLCULTURE PROJECT. The Department of Horticulture of V.P.I, has what\r\nis called a Hillculture project, with Professor R. C. Moore in charge.\r\nAmong the materials planted in connection with these studies are filbert\r\nvarieties to determine their possible value on hill farms in the\r\nmountainous regions of Southwest Virginia as a source of additional food\r\nand supplemental income for such families. The Forestry Division of TVA\r\nhas co-operated in supplying not only propagated plants of filberts, but\r\nalso of walnuts and seedlings of chestnuts.\r\n\r\nAmong the filberts now being grown are six German-named varieties from\r\nthe Hillculture Division of the Soil Conservation Service, Glenn Dale,\r\nMaryland, planted as rooted cuttings in 1941. The German varieties, are\r\nas follows: (1) Barr's Spanische; (2) Neue Riesennuss; (3) Fruhe von\r\nFruendorff; (4) Schliesserin; (5) Eckige Barelloner; and (6) Vollkugel.\r\n\r\nIn addition five varieties, including two of the Jones numbered\r\nseedlings from crosses between the American hazel and the European\r\nfilbert, purchased from the J. F. Jones Nursery[21] of Lancaster, Pa.,\r\nwere planted in 1947. These are the following: (1) Jones 185; (2) Bixby\r\n(a Jones hybrid), (3) Cosford, (4) Italian Red; (5) Large Globe and (6)\r\nMedium Long.\r\n\r\nSeedlings of the American hazel have also been planted. Dr. Crane may be\r\nable to send the V. P. I. Department of Horticulture a few plants of his\r\nseedlings 1667 and 2336 to include among the variety plantings.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Some Limitations of Filbert Growing in Virginia+\r\n\r\nDISEASES. Possibly the present most serious limitation to commercial\r\nproduction of filberts in Virginia is the Filbert Blight or Black Knot\r\n(_Cryptosporella anomala._ (PK) Sacc.). While this fungus results in\r\nlittle damage to native species (_C. americana_) it does spread rapidly\r\nand with serious results to European varieties in the State. Possibly\r\nthe seriousness of the disease has been lessened by the eradication of\r\nnative hazel plants on roadsides, fence rows, and in the wild nearby,\r\nwhich serve as hosts for the disease.\r\n\r\nIt is present on the American hazel, but does little damage to the\r\nplant. The disease, however, as mentioned, is a serious menace to either\r\nEuropean varieties or to the present hybrids resulting from _C.\r\namericana_ x _C. avellana_. The control to date is to prune off and burn\r\naffected parts. Mr. George Slate has mentioned that Mr. S. H. Graham of\r\nIthaca, New York, has a number of hybrids between _C. americana_ and _C.\r\navellana_ that have been subjected to severe attacks of Filbert Blight\r\nand a few of these have to date escaped, although the others have been\r\ndestroyed by blight.\r\n\r\nThe bacterial blight present on the Pacific Coast apparently does not\r\noccur in the East.\r\n\r\nINSECTS. A second limitation is the problem of the attacks of insects.\r\nDodge and Rickett (1948) report that _Corylus_ may be affected by a\r\nleaf-damage from the feeding of leaf-hoppers (_Phepsins ishida_; _P.\r\ntinctorius_), which may involve less than half the leaf or may extend to\r\nthe entire leaf. The first leaves to be infested are those next to the\r\nground, which are affected early in July. Most of the damage ceases by\r\nthe first week of August. Control is by spraying with nicotine sulphate\r\nand soap on the undersides of the leaves in late June or early July,\r\nrepeating at the end of a week.\r\n\r\nCertain nut weevils (_Balaninus spp._) attack the native hazels, but\r\nSlate (1930) reports they do not attack the European filbert (_C.\r\navellana_). Mr. Slate reports that in Geneva where nuts are carefully\r\npicked up they do not have much of a problem with weevils.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane reports that the Japanese beetle severely damages the filbert.\r\nWhile the Japanese beetle has not yet become widely established in\r\nVirginia, it undoubtedly will eventually become a problem throughout\r\nthis state. The Japanese beetle can be destroyed by using four pounds of\r\n50% wettable DDT or two pounds of actual DDT per 100 gallons. Such\r\nsprays should be applied as the Japanese beetles begin to cause injury,\r\nand usually two applications may be sufficient.\r\n\r\nMr. G. F. Gravatt has reported that his filbert plantings, surrounded on\r\nthree sides by woods, are badly attacked by stink bugs that sting the\r\nnuts. DDT as suggested for Japanese beetles may also be used for stink\r\nbugs.\r\n\r\nAnother serious insect pest on hazelnut is the curculio. Clean\r\ncultivation has been reported as a supplementary measure for curculio\r\ncontrol, as they depend, upon unbroken soil in the fall for their\r\nmetamorphosis. Some hybrids are reported as being relatively immune to\r\nthe attacks of curculio (Weschcke, 1946). Benezene hexachloride has\r\nshown promise with other plants in curculio control and may have\r\npossibilities on the filbert.\r\n\r\nLACK OF HARDINESS. A third limitation has been lack of hardiness in the\r\ncase of European varieties. With the European varieties the staminate or\r\nthe pistillate flowers or both are likely to be killed by winter\r\ntemperatures. In fact, occasional unduly low winter temperatures may\r\nkill the tree tops or even the tree trunks to the ground. The Winkler\r\nvariety (_C. americana_) has been reported as more hardy in New York\r\nState than the Barcelona (_C. avellana_) or the Jones hybrids (_C.\r\namericana_ x. _C. avellana_) (Ross Pier Wright, 1944).\r\n\r\nUnder western New York conditions, Slate (1930) reported that the\r\nblooming period starts about March 20 to 25 at Geneva, and lasts about a\r\nmonth. In central Virginia this may well be several weeks earlier. Slate\r\n(1930) also reports that the flowers in bloom will withstand\r\nconsiderable frost, and that even with temperatures of 16 deg.F. during the\r\nblooming season, neither female nor male flowers, may be injured.\r\nNevertheless, with filberts coming into bloom in late February to early\r\nMarch, they would be subjected to temperatures that might result in\r\ninjury especially to the catkins.\r\n\r\nSome of the more hardy varieties as reported by Slate (1930) include the\r\nfollowing: (a) White Lambert (not of value) (_C. maxima_); (b) Red\r\nLambert (_C. maxima_); (c) Cosford; (d) Purple Aveline (_C. avellana_);\r\nand (e) Early Globe (of little value).\r\n\r\nSome of the varieties upon which both the staminate and pistillate\r\nflowers tend to bloom relatively late are (a) Althaldensleber, (b)\r\nKentish Cob, (c) Red Aveline, (d) Purple Aveline, and (e) Bolwiller.\r\nLate blooming, however, does not necessarily insure escaping injury from\r\nlow spring temperatures. The Cosford, Italian Red, and Medium Long are\r\nconsidered by Slate as good for New York. The Bixby and Buchanan are the\r\nresult of crossing _C. americana_ x _C. avellana_, and appear to be of\r\npromise for home plantings in the East. Mr. H. F. Stoke is growing the\r\nItalian Red and Du Chilly (Kentish Cob) with Daviana for pollination\r\npurposes in the Roanoke area.\r\n\r\nCROSS-POLLINATION. A fourth limitation is the fact that varieties are\r\nnearly entirely if not fully dependent upon cross-pollinization by other\r\ninter-fertile varieties that bloom at about the same time in order to\r\ninsure a set of nuts. This limitation may be overcome by the proper\r\nplanning of hardy varieties are inter-fertile. Colby (1944) has reported\r\nthat the Winkler variety is self-fertile.\r\n\r\nSUCKERS. A sixth limitation is the tendency of the _C. avellana_ or _C.\r\nmaxima_ to sprout about the base and the labor and expense of keeping\r\nthese sprouts pruned out. It is possible that this factor may be\r\novercome by using Turkish hazel (_C. colurna_ L.) as an understock and\r\ngrafting or budding thereon the varieties that sprout when on their own\r\nroots. The Turkish hazel does not sprout as badly as the two other\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nNote by Editor: An Oregon nursery, which formerly propagated European\r\nfilberts on the Turkish understock, now has abandoned its use. The\r\ngrafted filbert tops did not seem to survive and bear as consistently as\r\nthose on their own roots, after a period of several years in orchards.\r\n\r\nPLANTING IN VIRGINIA. In a letter dated May 17, 1948, addressed to R.\r\nC. Moore, Assistant Horticulturist, V.P.I., H. J. Pettit, Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Planters Peanut Company, Suffolk, Virginia, reported\r\nthat some years ago they planted several thousand trees of filberts,\r\nwhich they obtained from the states of New York and Oregon. From their\r\nexperience it appears that late spring frosts destroyed the flower\r\nparts, which developed early, with the result that the yields were too\r\nlow to be profitable. Hence, the filberts were removed and the land\r\notherwise utilized. Mr. H. F. Stoke, however, in the Roanoke area has\r\nnot found lack of hardiness as serious as the problems of diseases and\r\ninsects of filberts.\r\n\r\nAn important nursery in Maryland has provided information to the effect\r\nthat during this past 1947-48 season it sold for planting in Virginia a\r\ntotal of 34 filbert plants in lots of from one to ten. Its 1947-48\r\ncatalogue lists varieties of filberts for sale as follows: Barcelona,\r\nDaviana, Du Chilly, and American hazel.\r\n\r\nDr. H. L. Crane, Principal Horticulturist of the USDA, writes in a\r\nletter dated July 27, 1948, that he knows of no substantial plantings\r\nbeing made anywhere in Virginia. He has observed a few bushes or trees\r\nscattered about the homesteads, particularly in the northern or more\r\nmountainous part of the state. In most cases the performance of these\r\nfilberts has not been entirely satisfactory because of leaf scorch\r\nduring the summer, due apparently to high temperatures or unfavorable\r\nmoisture conditions or to the winter killing of the catkins, or in some\r\ncases winter injury of the shoots. The largest plantings in Virginia\r\nthat have yet come to the attention of the V.P.I. Department of\r\nHorticulture are those of Mr. Stoke in the Roanoke area.\r\n\r\nDr. Crane has observed the planting of a few bushes of the American\r\nhazelnut in Virginia. Their performance has been somewhat better than\r\nhas been that of the European filbert, especially as to hardiness, and\r\nthese American hazelnuts have borne more satisfactory crops of nuts than\r\nhave the European filberts. The nuts produced by the native varieties,\r\nhowever, are small in size, thick shelled, and the kernels are small and\r\nlack quality. Observations by Dr. Crane, which have been made in the\r\nState of Virginia, lead him to believe that with the material that is at\r\npresent available from nurserymen, there is not much hope of successful\r\ncommercial filbert culture in the State of Virginia. When, however,\r\nseedlings 1667 and 2336 may become available, two varieties that are\r\nhardy and productive of fairly high quality nuts may provide material\r\nfor home plantings or for local markets.\r\n\r\n_Ornamental Value._ The filbert, however, also has possible value for\r\nornamental plantings with its attractive foliage, or as a hedge, as well\r\nas for nut production, providing the home owner will control insects and\r\ndiseases and maintain favorable growing conditions for our best known\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n_Future Outlook in Virginia._ With a further breeding program to combine\r\nthe hardiness of the American hazel and its tolerance to Filbert Blight\r\nwith some of the better qualities of the European and other species to\r\nobtain self-fertile varieties better adapted to Virginia conditions and\r\nwith the better insecticides and fungicides now becoming available for\r\ninsect and disease control, it may be that filbert growing in Virginia\r\nhas a brighter future outlook than now appears to be true.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Tree Nuts, Acreage, Production, Farm Disposition, Value,\r\nand Utilization of Sales, 1909-45.

We have a paper from Mr.\r\nElliott. Mr. Elliott is not here, but we are already behind our program,\r\nso I am afraid you are going to have to have that in printed form later\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFilberts for Food and Looks in Kentucky\r\n\r\n   N. R. ELLIOTT, Extension Landscape Specialist,\r\n   Department of Horticulture,\r\n   University of Kentucky\r\n\r\nThose of us interested in the landscape phase are always thinking of as\r\nmany different kinds of plants as possible that may be used to create\r\npleasing effects. Perhaps we might be criticized for overlooking several\r\nplants that would not only assist in creating pleasing effects but at\r\nthe same time produce edible fruits of good quality. In my own\r\nexperience I have often recommended the use of grape vines on a trellis\r\nto create a screen and at the same time produce fruit. Also in border\r\nplantings, like the shrub border, the gooseberries and currants make\r\nattractive shrubs and in addition supply fruits. In making these\r\nsuggestions for plantings one needs to depart somewhat from the usual\r\nrun of plants and in most instances the homeowner has never thought of\r\nusing plants for effects as well as fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Filberts Good Dual Purpose Plants+\r\n\r\nFilberts are certainly outstanding dual purpose plants, and I feel that\r\nthey have not been used nearly as much as they should be. If we think of\r\nlandscape from the broad point of view, we realize that screen or border\r\nplantings make up one of the most important parts of the set-up,\r\nespecially in rural parts. Practically every farm home has some\r\nunattractive view near by that needs to be screened out, either\r\npartially or entirely. This view may be caused by a lot where farm\r\nanimals are kept, an old, unattractive barn, or even a gullied field.\r\nLots where animals are kept and the barn are necessary parts of the farm\r\noperations, and the gullied field may result from neglect, but\r\nregardless of the cause for the undesirable view it can and should be\r\nscreened from view from the home.\r\n\r\nIn making a screen planting, two plans are possible--one, the shrub\r\nborder, and the other the hedge row, and filberts are excellent to use\r\nin either planting. Where space is at a premium, the hedge offers the\r\nbest form of screen. Filberts planted two and a half feet apart and\r\npruned in such a way as to make them have a shrub appearance will make\r\nan ideal hedge and produce lots of nuts of good quality. This hedge can\r\nbe counted on to be effective up to twelve feet in height.\r\n\r\nIn the shrub border filberts are allowed to produce many stems and to\r\ngrow into small trees. This is done by pruning and by using groups of\r\ntwo or three plants in a place, planted some five or six feet apart.\r\nDifferent varieties may be used for different groups, thereby producing\r\na variation of foliage. The filberts will take their places with the\r\nwell known small trees like the dogwood and the redbud, when used in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nStill another use for filberts in landscape work is to use them for\r\nsmall trees as lawn specimen plants. They have a size, shape, and\r\nfoliage that makes them attractive when used in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cross Pollination Necessary+\r\n\r\nOur experience has been that there is need for cross pollination to get\r\nmaximum yields of fruit; therefore, we suggest that different varieties\r\nbe used in a planting. Barcelona, DuChilly, and the Jones Hybrids seem\r\nto us well suited for this. Of course, there are others, but our\r\nexperience with varieties is limited.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the soil for filberts, we find that a fairly rich soil\r\nthat has plenty of moisture is the best. Of course, the soil must drain\r\nwell because the roots of filberts seem to be very susceptible to poorly\r\ndrained soil conditions. If there is a lot of sand in the soil, give the\r\nfilberts more moisture and food because they are rapid growers.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have not had many complaints about filberts suffering from\r\nwinter injury. This may be due to the fact that so far Kentucky is not\r\nusing great quantities of these plants, or it may be due to the fact\r\nthat the varieties used have been reasonably hardy. The little winter\r\ninjury seen so far has been in the terminal twig growth, and removal of\r\nthese twigs in the spring has not meant altering the normal shape of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether there is any significance to it but the filberts\r\nthat have been fed by using well rotted manure applied in the fall and\r\nspaded into the top four inches of soil next spring have made the best\r\ngrowth and produced the most fruit.\r\n\r\nSo far the filberts that we have had experience with have been free from\r\ninsects and diseases. One never knows how long that condition will last.\r\n\r\nNow, when it comes to discussing filberts as a food, all that I want to\r\nsay is that at Christmas time when you buy mixed nuts you usually get a\r\nfew of the filberts in the mixture. These nuts are good eating, and when\r\nthe plants are grown on the home grounds everyone who has them says they\r\nare much enjoyed by all members of the family. Our experience has been\r\nthat filberts yield annually and, if given reasonable care, in good\r\namounts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we would like to say we feel there is not only a place for\r\nfilberts in landscape work, but there is an absolute need for greater\r\nuse of these plants especially in rural plantings. At present, the\r\nprofessional landscape artists are not inclined to recommend them as\r\noften as they could, simply because they have not been trained to think\r\nof dual purpose plants. Greater publicity as to the value of these\r\nplants would undoubtedly mean greater use of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: We also have a paper from Mr. Reed, which is of\r\nquite a good deal of importance historically on the work of Mr. Jones. I\r\nwish you could have that. Probably you will have to read that, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. F. Jones, Introducer of Many Nut Varieties\r\n\r\nCLARENCE A. REED, Collaborator[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of J. F. Jones was once one of the best known and most highly\r\nrespected in eastern nut culture. It was from Mountain Grove, Wright\r\nCounty, Mo., that he was first heard from in 1900, when he discovered\r\nand introduced the Rockville hican, which he named after the nearest\r\ntown. It never proved of value, but that fact did not detract from the\r\nimportance of being first, a habit which remained with him till his\r\ndeath. In 1902 he moved to Monticello, Jefferson County, Florida; five\r\nyears later he moved to Jeanerette, Iberia Parish, Louisiana; and in\r\n1912, he moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he died in January,\r\n1928.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1903, while at Monticello, he successfully graft-propagated the Rush\r\nPersian (English) walnut and the Weiker hickory, an intermediate form\r\nbetween shagbark and shellbark. Both were from Lancaster County, and he\r\nused scions sent him by J. G. Rush, of West Willow, south of Lancaster.\r\nMr. Rush is credited with introducing the walnut bearing his name, while\r\ncredit went to Mr. Jones for the Weiker hickory. Some years later, on\r\ntwo occasions, Mr. Jones took a visitor to the Weiker parent tree when\r\nthe branches were laden with nuts so that they hung down in a manner\r\nsuggestive of plums. For some reason, never explained, no other tree of\r\nthe variety, so far as is known, ever bore as much as a quart of nuts,\r\nalthough the trees frequently flowered profusely. The variety was,\r\nhowever, markedly dichogamous. The parent tree, which stood in the yard\r\nof Mr. Christ LeFever of Lampeter, about two miles east of the Jones\r\nhome, was blown over in a heavy gale many years ago.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones graft-propagated a considerable number of Hales shagbark while\r\nat Monticello, with scions that came from the original tree near\r\nRidgewood, New Jersey. However, this variety was first propagated by\r\nHenry Hales of Ridgewood, in 1879. He also had Kirtland from Yalesville,\r\nConnecticut, but like many others since that time, both it and Hales\r\nproved to be light bearers. Other hickories may have been propagated by\r\nMr. Jones while at Monticello but these are the only ones of which there\r\nis record. The Kirtland was first propagated in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: U.S.D.A. Bureau of Plant Industry, Soils and Agricultural\r\nEngineering, Plant Industry Station, Beltsville, Md.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+First Carload of Grafted Pecan Trees+\r\n\r\nWhen he went to Florida, there were few pecan trees of bearing age in\r\neither that State or Georgia and none to speak of in the Carolinas. The\r\n\"fast\" trains went no more than 30 or 35 miles an hour, and a minimum of\r\nthree days was required to see even an occasional planting or a single\r\ntree. Within the next few years, nurserymen everywhere propagated their\r\nown varieties and listed them in their catalogs. Mr. Jones was\r\ndiscriminating and propagated only varieties that then had the best\r\nreputation, such as Schley and Stuart, and some others that have not\r\nstood the test of time. In one way, he was distinctively first; he\r\nshipped the first carload of pecan trees ever to go to one address. This\r\nwas in January of 1906, when 10,000 trees were shipped to Professor H.\r\nE. Van Deman who was then establishing a 900-acre orchard near Ferriday,\r\nLa. A picture of the car appeared in the American Nut Journal, published\r\nby W. N. Roper, Petersburg, Va., Vol. III, No. 50, March 1906, (Van\r\nDeman had been the first Pomologist in the Department of Agriculture,\r\n1886 to 1892).\r\n\r\nMr. Ray Simpson of Vincennes, Ind., went to Mr. Jones to learn how to\r\ngraft pecan trees. He offered to work without pay if Mr. Jones would\r\nteach him the art. He had graduated at Cornell in 1905, and had been\r\ninspired by John Craig, Professor of Horticulture there. Craig himself\r\nlater invested somewhat heavily in pecan orchards both near Monticello\r\nand at Albany, Georgia. Mr. Simpson was taken on and proved as good a\r\npropagator as the best hand and received the same pay.\r\n\r\nWhile at Monticello Mr. Jones began to feel that the region might not be\r\nthe best place for pecans. Perhaps he had made a mistake. It was 300\r\nmiles to middle western Alabama, where there were the nearest native\r\ntrees. A disease was appearing among many of the trees planted in the\r\nEast, which was then poorly understood (rosette). Pecan wood for budding\r\nand grafting was scarce and Mr. Jones would trust no one to cut it for\r\nhim. He went to the trees himself.\r\n\r\nOne man who then had an abundance of wood and who could be relied upon\r\nwas B. M. Young of Morgan City, La., and Mr. Jones went to him for wood\r\nseveral times. Once he became confused as to the trees from which he had\r\ncut a couple of bundles, so both were thrown in the river and he went\r\nback for more. Mr. Young was greatly impressed, so much so that he\r\nremembered the incident, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Move to Louisiana+\r\n\r\nBack in Florida Ray Simpson wished to buy and Mr. Jones wished to sell,\r\nso a deal was soon made. Mr. Jones went to Louisiana where the pecan is\r\nnative and there were many large trees, probably as many as could be\r\nfound in any one place in the entire South. Mr. Young knew of a group\r\nfrom St. Paul, Minnesota, who were about to buy and plant a thousand\r\nacres near Jeanerette and who were looking for an experienced man to\r\ntake charge. Mr. Jones was recommended and was soon at work. For another\r\nfive years, he worked harder than almost any other white man in the\r\nState. Great odds were against him. Being from the North, he did not\r\nassociate exclusively with whites, and presently the southern white\r\npeople left him severely alone. That was not all; he could not raise as\r\ngood nursery trees as he had in Florida. The trees grew slowly in the\r\ncold, heavy soil of Louisiana, and the fibrous root system failed to\r\nmaterialize. The excellent reputation he and his trees had enjoyed in\r\nMonticello began to deteriorate. He worked harder than ever and waited\r\nfor a break. When it came, he did not hesitate.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Jones Shifts to Pennsylvania+\r\n\r\nThe St. Paul crowd fell into a squabble and divided into two factions,\r\neach wishing control. A man went south to see if Mr. Jones would sell\r\nhis stock. Would he? He knew when to keep his mouth shut and he meekly\r\nmade a deal. He was probably never more glad over anything in his life.\r\nHe came north, lock, stock, and barrel. But he was far from being\r\nwithout a place to land. Since his Monticello days, he and Mr. Rush had\r\nbeen good friends. Mr. Rush knew a farm of 20 acres with buildings,\r\nwhich could be had for $8,000. It was four miles south of Lancaster, and\r\nat a point where two main highways leading into the city came together.\r\nIt sloped eastward enough so that it did not get the full force of west\r\nwinds. It was two miles from Mr. Rush's home, with the town of Willow\r\nStreet between.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones then began eight or 10 years of lean hard work. He modernized\r\nbuildings, planted an orchard of nut varieties most of which were\r\npurchased from W. C. Reed of Vincennes, Ind., and W. N. Roper of\r\nPetersburg, Va. From Roper he bought both seedling and grafted trees.\r\nSome of the \"seedlings\" had been budded and then not cut back to force\r\nthe buds. The latter were still dormant and when the trees were properly\r\ncut back, the buds pushed forth. T. P. Littlepage, of Washington, and\r\nProf. W. N. Hutt, of Raleigh, N. C., had a good laugh at Roper, but as\r\nthe trees bore no labels, they were no more valuable than seedlings and\r\nwere treated as such. All three men are now deceased.\r\n\r\nThomas black walnut trees came from E. A. Riehl, Godfrey, Illinois. The\r\nvariety had originated in eastern Pennsylvania and was first grafted in\r\n1881 by J. W. Thomas and Son, at King of Prussia, Pa. The parent tree\r\nhad been destroyed some time before by the Pennsylvania Railroad, in\r\nextending its lines. The Thomas is today the most widely planted\r\nvariety, although it has rarely borne well. Mr. Jones selected and\r\ngrafted the Ohio walnut, but the owner of the seed-parent tree was given\r\ncredit for its introduction, although she probably knows nothing of the\r\nincident, to this day. She was a Miss Clark, McCutcheonville, Ohio, and\r\nit was felt that it would help more to give her name as originator if\r\none were ever to locate the tree.\r\n\r\n   [See Ohio black walnut original tree photos, NNGA Rept., 1946.--Ed.]\r\n\r\nThe Stabler eastern black walnut, introduced in 1916 by Mr. T. P.\r\nLittlepage by means of a paragraph inserted in the _Country Gentleman_,\r\nwas also propagated by Mr. Jones, but he early found it disappointing in\r\nits habits of bearing. He also found that about 80 percent of the nuts\r\nfrom the parent tree had single kernels, while with young trees 80\r\npercent had double kernels. Most planters have long since discontinued\r\nusing this variety. However, Mrs. Jane Baum, Douglassville, Pa., reports\r\nthat her customers like the Stabler best. Others she has are Thomas,\r\nOhio, and Ten Eyck.\r\n\r\nOther varieties were tested by Mr. Jones, but he pushed none of them,\r\nrightly thinking that 4 leaders were as many as a nursery could afford\r\nto carry. He insisted that a new variety would have to prove its\r\nsuperiority before he would insert it in his catalog. Among other\r\nvarieties was the Peanut from southern Ohio, the nut of which had single\r\nlobes; but apparently there was some mistake along the line, as nuts\r\nfrom grafted trees were indifferent and had 2 half kernels. He also had\r\nCreitz from Indiana, which Mr. H. F. Stoke, 1436 Watts Avenue, Roanoke,\r\nVa., thinks well of at this time. It was a prize winner in the 1926\r\ncontest of the NNGA. Neither Creitz nor Peanut was a Jones introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n+His Work with Hickories+\r\n\r\nAmong the hickories, there was the Stanley from Indiana in 1916, which\r\nwas quite a favorite with Mr. Jones for some time. But did any one ever\r\nsee a shellbark that bore well and filled the nuts? Shellbark trees are\r\nbeautiful to look at, have enormous leaves, seven to nine leaflets, but\r\nthey leaf out early in spring and the flowers are frequently killed back\r\nby spring frosts. Part of its flowers are killed outright with too great\r\nfrequency for it to be worth growing for the nuts. These are very large,\r\nthe hulls split entirely to the base, and what kernel there is, is of\r\nsugar-like sweetness. The shells are mostly thick and the kernels seldom\r\nwell-filled.\r\n\r\nThe Glover shagbark hickory, from Connecticut, which was introduced by\r\nMr. Jones in 1918, is undoubtedly one of the best shagbarks yet\r\npropagated. The nuts are of medium size and shell thickness. The flavor\r\nis very good. Most shagbarks have five leaflets; this one has seven\r\nquite as often, and the leaf is about a foot long.\r\n\r\nThere were other hybrids, or what are supposed to be hybrids. The Pleas\r\nhickory, introduced in 1916, was perhaps first successfully grafted by\r\nMr. Jones, but credit for introduction went to the owner of the parent\r\ntree, Dr. E. Pleas, Collinsville, Oklahoma. It was a beautiful tree,\r\nshapely, with an air of considerable refinement, making it a graceful\r\nlawn tree. It bore fairly well, although not heavily. The nuts were\r\nthin-shelled and also had thin hulls that split entirely to the base. So\r\nfar as most laymen are concerned, the Pleas may be but an edible, or\r\nsemi-edible bitternut. On the grounds of the Plant Industry Station, at\r\nBeltsville, Md., there were once two trees of Pleas, but they were given\r\nto the Wild Life Service for planting 10 miles away, although there are\r\nmany native bitternut trees just over the line fence in neighboring\r\nwoods. We fancied that we could detect bitternut flavor in good\r\nshagbarks about the plantings, due to xenia influence, as in the case of\r\nchestnuts.\r\n\r\nBurlington was another hican first propagated by Mr. Jones, in 1915. It\r\ncame from eastern Iowa, and for a time was confused with Marquardt,\r\nwhich never was propagated, or apparently not. Burlington makes a fine\r\nappearing tree and serves well for ornamental purposes. It bears fairly\r\nwell while young, but soon develops faulty nuts, few being well-filled\r\nand the majority weevil infested. It is also subject to shuck-worm and\r\ntwig girdler injury.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones once wrote that he had given up with the hickories \"in\r\ndisgust.\" So far as is known, he never used any stock for hickories\r\nother than pecan, which grew well, made good unions and generally\r\noutgrew the scions. John Hershey, however, says this is not a good\r\ncombination, but there are too many trees of Jones' propagation about\r\nthe country, to accept Hershey's verdict altogether. Carl Weschcke[23],\r\nof St. Paul, uses bitternut largely or entirely; if it is a mistake, it\r\nwill be expensive. Hickories are slow to grow and one gets too few nuts\r\nat best. It takes a lifetime to get even small crops, and for our part,\r\nwe want no bitternuts on the place. Too often shagbarks fail to unite\r\nwith bitternut and frequently they are short-lived.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 Mr. Jones propagated and introduced the Beaver hickory, from\r\ncentral Pennsylvania, a supposed bitternut-shagbark cross. It proved of\r\nlittle value and soon disappeared. The Fairbanks from northeast Iowa, a\r\nsimilar cross, was introduced the same year. It was one of the prettiest\r\nof all hybrids and stood up about the longest, but it had too much\r\nbitterness in the pellicle encasing the kernel and was much subject to\r\nweevil injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Efforts with Persian Walnuts+\r\n\r\nMany varieties of Persian (English) walnut were propagated and brought\r\ninto bearing. Mr. Jones included a majority of the varieties brought\r\ninto the country from France by Felix Gillet, of Nevada City, Calif., as\r\nearly as 1870. There were Franquette, Mayette, Meylan, Parisienne, and a\r\ncutleaf variety which appears to have had no other name. A California\r\nvariety of which he thought well for a number of years was Eureka, a\r\nwestern introduction of 1908. He propagated a number of eastern\r\nvarieties such as Lancaster (Alpine) in 1913, although credit went to\r\nMr. Rush; Boston, from Massachusetts, also in 1913; Ontario, from\r\nCanada, in 1914; and probably others. He obtained Chinese walnuts, from\r\nP. Wang, Kinsan Arboretum, Shanghai, and sold seedlings at wholesale.\r\nThese were an Asiatic form of _Juglans regia_. He limed the soil, and\r\nthought the effects were beneficial. In this he was warmly supported by\r\nT. P. Littlepage and more recently by growers in Northern Ohio; but\r\nlately liming has not been found beneficial in Italy. All in all,\r\nhowever, the Persian walnut was not particularly dependable, and during\r\nthe last few years the nursery which he left discontinued selling\r\nPersian walnut trees. In the East, the trees of older varieties usually\r\nwere little more than interesting novelties.\r\n\r\n\r\n+He Tried the Chinese Chestnut+\r\n\r\nThe Chinese chestnut was tried for a few years; but as so often happens\r\nwith this species, nursery trees died badly in winter and Mr. Jones\r\nthought it due to blight, a disease which was then sweeping his part of\r\nthe country, taking its mortal toll of both American and European\r\nspecies. However, blight does not seriously attack young trees and it is\r\nmore likely that death was caused by a combination of summer drouth and\r\nwinter cold; but no matter, the trees perished and the result was the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n+First Heartnut Grafts+\r\n\r\nMr. Jones tried the butternut and there is still one tree in the\r\nexperimental planting east of the residence. It is Aiken, from New\r\nEngland, and was first propagated by him in 1918. It proved\r\ndisappointing. He grafted the first heartnut ever grafted of any kind\r\ninsofar as is known, the Lancaster, in 1918. The only other heartnut for\r\nwhich he received full credit for first propagation was Faust, obtained\r\nfrom a dentist, Dr. 0. D. Faust, Bamberg, S. C., in 1918. Others that he\r\nwas doubtless first to propagate, but for which credit went to the\r\nowners of the parent trees, were Bates and Stranger in 1919, both from\r\nR. Bates, Jackson, Aiken County, S. C., and Ritchie, a Virginia variety\r\nfound by John W. Ritchie of Flemington, N. J., in 1918.\r\n\r\nHowever, heartnuts are seldom heavy bearers and the trees do not grow\r\nlarge or live long. In Japan the wood is sometimes used for gunstocks\r\nbut only because better material is unavailable. Heartnuts have\r\npractically no market where other kinds of nuts can be had and the trees\r\nare much subject to \"bunch\" disease. To an enormous extent the trees\r\nhave been sold to unsuspecting people of the South and East as \"English\"\r\nwalnuts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: See Weschcke's paper, elsewhere in this report.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Filbert+\r\n\r\nMr. Jones had a tree or two of the Turkish filbert, a species sometimes\r\nreaching a height of 60 feet and attaining a trunk diameter of three\r\nfeet or more. Bixby found the species hardy in central New Hampshire.\r\nMr. Jones obtained his seed from three trees in Highland Park,\r\nRochester, New York, which are believed to be the oldest in the country.\r\nIn some years, the Rochester trees bear freely, while in others there is\r\nnot a nut. This is a valuable ornamental species, as it is green from\r\nearly spring till the last thing in fall; specimens must be selected for\r\nsuch use, as often the trees are unshapely. Like all filberts, they are\r\nsubject to Japanese beetle attack and must be sprayed or otherwise\r\nprotected in beetle infested zones. Filbert foliage may be destroyed by\r\nthese insects as many as three times in a summer and the trees die down\r\nto the ground. The nuts are too small to be of value; but the wood is\r\nwhite, very hard, and makes good turned articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n+His Greatest Contribution+\r\n\r\nIt was with the filbert that Mr. Jones made his greatest contribution to\r\nnut culture. In 1917 he tried crossing European varieties with pollen of\r\nthe native Rush. There were no results, and he tried again in 1918 with\r\nno better luck. In 1919 he reversed the order of crossing and nearly\r\nevery nut set. He had discovered that native pollen was not effective on\r\nEuropean stigmas, but that the reciprocal cross worked. By 1924 he had a\r\nfine lot of fruiting plants. The great majority were of no value, but\r\nhis No. 200 apparently was well worth while. It was named Bixby in 1937,\r\nfour years after another seedling, No. 91, had been named Buchanan. The\r\nexplanation of this belated selection is that the soil about the Bixby\r\ntree had so eroded that the tree was starved for a time; but with a\r\ncouple of years of heavy application of stable manure, it came back, so\r\nmuch so that it is now considered the better of the two. Both are rather\r\nsmall as compared with the large filberts of the Pacific Northwest; but\r\nwhen fully mature, they are sweet and agreeable.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Jones was gone, the place was managed by his daughter, Miss\r\nMildred Jones. She kept plants of her father's filbert varieties and the\r\nbest of the crosses. The latter are now called the Mildred filberts, a\r\nname applied in _Standardized Plant Names_ to the entire group of\r\ncrosses between Rush American and any European filbert. Mr. Jones hoped\r\nto have these called after himself but there was an old variety of Jones\r\n\"hazel\" and so his own name could not be used. He once sent specimens to\r\nDr. C. S. Sargent of Arnold Arboretum and somehow gained the impression\r\nthat the name Jones was given to the cross. Later, however, Sargent's\r\nsuccessor, Mr. Alfred Rehder wrote that Sargent had not used the name in\r\neither correspondence or on specimens placed in the herbarium.\r\n\r\nThe example of Mr. Jones in breeding filberts has since been followed by\r\nothers, as the Department of Agriculture, the New York State\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station at Geneva, and. Mr. Carl Weschcke of St.\r\nPaul, Minnesota. The last has copyrighted his crosses under the\r\ndesignation \"hazilbert,\" which is a good name; but with the issue of\r\n_Standardized Plant Names_ in 1942, the name \"hazel\" was dropped for all\r\nmembers of the family. For a time, an effort was made to distinguish\r\nbetween the two by calling small-fruited ones \"hazels\" and those with\r\nlarge fruits \"filberts,\" but there is not exact dividing line and so now\r\nall are called filberts.\r\n\r\nBuchanan and Bixby are the only varieties of Mildred filberts thus far\r\nfully released by anyone and although neither variety is entirely hardy\r\nin the northernmost parts of the country, they do well as far south as\r\neastern Tennessee. The nuts of both are too small to compete in the\r\nmarket with the large filberts of Oregon and Washington, but that is not\r\nthe purpose for which they have been bred. It is for home planting, a\r\nuse for which they are admirably adapted. Neither variety should be\r\njudged until after they have cured fully, at least a month or more. Then\r\nthe flavor is excellent.\r\n\r\nOf the various introductions made by Mr. Jones, the ones most likely to\r\nendure are the Ohio black walnut, the Glover shagbark hickory, and the\r\nMildred filberts. The first has already lasted 32 years; the second 30\r\nyears; and the Mildred filberts are only nicely started.[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Except for the last two paragraphs, this paper was read\r\nand approved by Miss Mildred Jones in Pavilion, N. Y., on September 2,\r\n1948. The following day, or September 3, she became Mrs. Wesley Langdoc,\r\nof P. O. Box 126, Erie, Illinois.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mr. Reed Comments on Seedling Trees+\r\n\r\n+Editor's Note:+ The next two paragraphs should be read in connection with\r\nthe \"Round Table\" on chestnut problems, elsewhere in this volume.\r\n\r\nIn a broad sense, it must be remembered that every variety of seedling\r\ntree, of any species and every hybrid form that has ever been planted,\r\nor grafted on another tree, has been worth something. This is still a\r\nfree country and every man has the inalienable right to plant whatever\r\nhe pleases. Even the hybrids of various forms, hickory, walnut, and\r\nchestnut, are all worth something. All are trees and it is better to\r\nplant a poor kind of tree than not to plant anything, particularly if it\r\nis a nut tree. Whatever prompts a man to plant a tree is worth while.\r\n\r\nHybrid chestnuts bred by crossing Chinese chestnuts of unknown\r\nperformance record as to habit of bearing, size or flavor of nut, shape\r\nof tree, resistance to blight, or spring freezes, and other\r\ncharacteristics which combine to make good nuts, with the inferior and\r\nlargely inedible Japanese chestnuts, are unlikely to do the damage to\r\nthe industry that is sometimes predicted. They are now so mixed up that\r\nfew will be planted by themselves, and there is considerable evidence\r\nthat the xenia influence of good Chinese chestnuts with which the trees\r\nare being planted will render nuts from these hybrid trees fit to market\r\nand eat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILDRED AND WESLEY LANGDOC]\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The value of nut trees in Tennessee, then, will be\r\ndiscussed by Mr. F. S. Chance of the Tennessee Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation in Knoxville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Value of Nut Trees in Tennessee\r\n\r\nF. S. CHANCE, Vice-Director, Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nKnoxville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chance: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: As a representative of\r\nthe Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Tennessee I\r\nwant to say it is a great honor to have this distinguished group meet\r\nhere in Tennessee, especially on the banks of beautiful Norris Lake,\r\nwhich is one of the tributaries to the dammedest river in the country.\r\nWe are something like 600 miles from the Gilbertsville Dam, or Kentucky\r\nDam near Paducah, Kentucky, and this area here is the beginning of a\r\nchain of lakes that run just about that far.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are from a distance, you may know that in making a\r\nchain of lakes out of this great Tennessee Valley that we covered up\r\nlots of good land. We have developed lots of good power. Now, I am not\r\njust sure why I was put on this program, because, really I am not a nut\r\ntree specialist, as I see most of you people are. I will admit that I\r\nhave been associating with experimentation for the last eight or ten\r\nyears and have become slightly nutty, but really my big interest is\r\ntimber. I am still a blockhead. So in discussing and talking with you\r\nthis morning for a few minutes about the value of nut trees in Tennessee\r\nI want you to just keep in the back of your minds that the thing in the\r\ntimber world that I think is the prettiest when it comes to furniture is\r\nblack walnut.\r\n\r\nSo in some plantings that we made several years ago with the help of\r\nSpencer Chase at our various substations and at the parent station at\r\nKnoxville, when we began to prune those trees I wanted to go to pruning\r\nfor timber and he wanted to go to pruning for nuts. He won. So as we\r\ndeveloped these plantings we are sure that we are going to have some\r\nvery excellent nut trees.\r\n\r\nTennessee ranging in altitude from something over a mile high down to\r\nsome 300 or 350 feet at Memphis on the Mississippi gives us a very, very\r\nwide range of climate. This wide range of climate gives us the\r\npossibility of growing a very wide range of timber trees. A great part\r\nof that area is soil from a limestone formation. Nearly all parts of\r\nTennessee are well adapted to the production of the black walnut. The\r\ntree as a nut tree has not in the past been looked at with such great\r\ninterest. However, there are farms in Tennessee that have been purchased\r\nwith walnut kernels. Over the period of years, why, thrifty families,\r\nespecially in Eastern Tennessee sections, have gathered up the walnuts\r\nin the neighborhood round about, cracked them and sold the kernels and\r\nfrom year to year made certain accumulations of that kind, funds, and\r\nsaved them with enough in the bank or in the sock to buy a farm. I knew\r\none particular person who bought a nice farm in just that way.\r\n\r\nNow, a great many of the people in the same neighborhood did not save\r\ntheir walnuts. These walnuts were gathered from everybody's trees\r\nwithout any objection on the part of anyone. But it was a means of those\r\npeople getting ahead with their savings from their other farming\r\noperations, and this wintertime work that they could put in, why, that\r\nkind of thrift is the kind that gets people ahead who want to get ahead\r\nand have vision.\r\n\r\nI might say a few words about pecans in Tennessee. We have throughout\r\nthe state quite a few scattered native pecans that are used, especially\r\nin all except the more western sections of the state. As a whole they\r\nare for home use. Now, in the extreme western section of the state we\r\nhave a certain amount of seedling pecans, mostly, that produce a\r\nconsiderable income to a limited number of people. In the 1945 census\r\nsomething over 4,000 farms reported some income from pecans--this was\r\nmostly in the western section of the state--the value of which was\r\nsomething over $32,000, which at the present time would be a\r\nconsiderable under-valuation.\r\n\r\nThis tree is found, I might say, throughout the state. I recall a few\r\nyears ago coming off of the Cumberland Plateau down in Warren County\r\ninto the cove there around Viola and seeing a beautiful grove of pecans\r\nalong a stream. I hadn't been through that country before, but I had\r\nknown a family that lived there, and I stopped at a house to see just\r\nwhat those pecans meant. And there was an old lady on the porch who\r\nowned the property, and I asked her some questions about it, and she\r\ntold me how they got there and knew when they were not there. She had\r\nbeen raised on that place but she said, \"I want to show you something.\"\r\nSo I went with her around the side yard into the back yard, and she had\r\na couple of pecan trees there that were loaded with pecans until the\r\nlimbs were hanging over just like pear tree limbs, heavily loaded pear\r\ntree limbs. I said, \"My, what a crop of pecans you have here. That's\r\nreally wonderful.\" Those were the budded pecans, the type that is grown\r\nfarther south of us. She said, \"Just wait a minute, now. I don't know\r\nwhether I have any pecans or not.\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" She said,\r\n\"If the frost is two weeks later than usual we will have a wonderful\r\npecan crop, if we have a late frost. If we have an early frost we don't\r\nhave any pecans.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite interesting to me to see that wonderful crop hanging on the\r\ntree and yet she wasn't at all assured that anything of value would come\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nWe have on some of our holdings at the University experimental Stations\r\nsome wonderful Chinese chestnut trees. I can't get overly excited over\r\nthem, remembering the chestnut as we had it once in Tennessee with the\r\nlong, slender body, wonderful telephone poles and wonderful timber of\r\nother kinds, and to see that a tremendous economic loss has come to this\r\ncountry through disease that was and probably is not controllable. But\r\nfrom the nut standpoint we have at the present time some trees that look\r\nas though they are going to be the equal of our own native chestnut that\r\ncovered Tennessee from the mountain top to the river bank. So we are\r\nvery much in hope that again Tennessee will have a supply of chestnuts\r\nwhich will be equivalent, probably, to the harvest of chestnuts we once\r\nhad. However, that's going to be many, many years off.\r\n\r\nFrom the experimental standpoint I have been very much interested in the\r\ntimber type of tree, hoping that our native chestnut trees, at least one\r\nout of the billions, maybe would prove to be resistant. However,\r\nwatching these growths come up from time to time and attain an age\r\nsufficient to produce nuts and then have my hopes blighted by going back\r\nthe next year and finding that the tree was blighted has become rather\r\ndiscouraging. I hope that some of you people will find just such a tree,\r\none that will bear an excellent nut and at the same time produce\r\nexcellent timber.\r\n\r\nNow I am coming to our big asset in the way of nut trees in Tennessee,\r\nas I see it. I was rather interested here in Professor Moore's\r\ndiscussion of the honeylocust, that detestable tree which was such a\r\nthorn in my flesh as a child, and having heard someone championing it\r\nwith such a story as he had, I have heard everything now. Everybody,\r\nthough, has a champion. Even my mother loved me, regardless.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut is, as I said in the beginning, native to all sections of\r\nthe state, and I think that through the collection of the better\r\nyielding or better cracking nuts by the Tennessee Valley Authority we\r\nare going to find in this crop a very potent asset to the state of\r\nTennessee through the income from sale of nuts. We have in the state\r\nabout four cracking plants. One of them is located in Morristown. Down\r\nin the basin part of the state where walnuts do particularly well, three\r\nothers are in the city of Nashville. There were something like 10\r\nmillion pounds of walnuts in the shell delivered in Nashville this last\r\nyear, yielding about 1,200,000 pounds of kernels. Now, this is no mean\r\nreturn from a crop which was really just gathered up with very, very\r\nlittle attention given to the planting. It is just one of these free\r\ncrops, so to speak.\r\n\r\nIf we were to add to that income the great income which we have been\r\nreceiving through the years from the sale of timber trees, we would run\r\nthe value of the black walnut into considerable proportions, with income\r\nfrom the sale of black walnuts in the kernel and in timber.\r\n\r\nI see no particular reason why that crop cannot be increased ten, twenty\r\nor a hundred fold by just a stimulation of interest in the black walnut.\r\nI recall back just previous to World War I, or about that time, there\r\nwas a tremendous demand, as usual, for black walnut for gun stocks. I\r\nhappened to be free for a month or so at that time so I could give some\r\nattention to the purchasing and delivery of both veneer stock and walnut\r\nfor gun stocks. It was quite interesting to me as I went over a couple\r\nof counties in which I made some purchases, to see that someone in the\r\n40, 50 or 60 years back had had a vision of what the walnut tree would\r\nbe worth to them on their tracts of land and how we were at that time\r\nreaping the harvest of the person who had a vision of the value of the\r\nwalnut tree. A great many of those trees were trees that had been set or\r\nwalnuts that had been planted years before by some far-seeing person,\r\nand it had gone on without any interruption, probably without the\r\nslightest bit of protection, until the time that it was needed and\r\ndesperately needed for economic purposes.\r\n\r\nWe have some work going on also in connection with the planting of\r\nwalnuts in pasture fields. The returns _from the pasture_ in the\r\nplanting of walnut trees have been just practically the same, maybe a\r\nlittle bit better in favor of the walnuts than where we did not have\r\nwalnuts in the pasture. This work is being conducted down at the Middle\r\nTennessee Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Tennessee\r\nat Columbia. We are using the walnut tree and also the black locust in\r\nthis experiment. We don't know what the future of it is going to be, but\r\nthose walnut trees have grown large enough so that they have had to be\r\nthinned to keep them from putting too much shade over the ground.\r\n\r\nI made a statement several years ago in the presence of quite a\r\ndistinguished agronomist or horticulturist that I had never seen a\r\nwalnut tree growing in the open, whether it was in the blue grass region\r\nor outside of a blue grass region that did not have blue grass growing\r\nunder it. He looked at me askance, and I said, \"Do you believe it?\"\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" he answered.\r\n\r\nSo we happened to be coming out of Quincy, Florida, up through southern\r\nGeorgia outside of the blue grass region, and we were both sitting in\r\nthe back seat of the car. Our driver drove up to a filling station, and\r\nI saw this fellow looked up at a walnut tree over in the yard not very\r\nfar away, in fact, the next yard to the filling station. I somehow or\r\nother sensed what he was thinking. He pushed his door open, got out. I\r\npushed my door open, went around the car and followed him. He walked up\r\nto that walnut tree, turned around and said, \"Well, it's there.\" He\r\nturned around and walked back.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, a condition may prevail in dense shade, where that does\r\nnot happen in young walnut trees, but I just happened to be right. There\r\nis a symbiotic relationship between plants--I don't want to get into\r\nthat subject--but this one thing I am thinking, and that is that the\r\nreason why they were able to get this good grazing from under these\r\nwalnut trees is that there is a relationship there between those two\r\nplants that makes it ideal for the production of pasture grass, and blue\r\ngrass over a great many of our states is our leading grass.\r\n\r\nI might say to the gentleman from Virginia that I had a letter from up\r\nthere a few days ago. I don't know why they wanted to write to me,\r\nwanting to know if the walnut tree was _a legume_. So I presume that\r\nthat was the reason, that the grass grew very nicely under those trees.\r\n\r\nI have taken too much of your valuable time. It certainly has been a\r\npleasure and an honor to be here and talk to you these few minutes.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Chance. We will take a short recess.\r\n\r\n(Recess taken.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The meeting will now come to order, please. The\r\nembryo development of the black walnut will be illustrated and discussed\r\nby Dr. L. H. MacDaniels of Cornell University.\r\n\r\n(Paper to appear in next volume.)\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: I was very glad Dr. MacDaniels' paper preceded mine, because\r\nit does give you a very much better picture of the development of all of\r\nour oily nuts, excepting the filbert and, of course, the almond to some\r\nextent. But we take in pecans and the hickories and for the walnuts the\r\nsituation is quite general.\r\n\r\nNow, this paper that I am going to read is one that our staff in nut\r\ninvestigations has been working on for the past twenty or more years,\r\nand we feel we know a lot about the growing and the development and\r\nfilling of nuts. And there is a lot in this paper that I think will be\r\nof value to all nut growers regardless of the kind of nuts that we are\r\ntrying to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Development and Filling of Nuts\r\n\r\nH. L. CRANE, Principal Horticulturist, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, Agricultural Research Administration, Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry, Soils, and Agricultural Engineering, Division of Fruit and\r\nVegetable Crops and Diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll nut growers are confronted with the problems involved in the\r\nproduction of nuts of large size with well filled kernels that are\r\n\"bright\" or light colored. Unsatisfactory development and filling of the\r\nkernels is more often a cause of complaint by growers than any other\r\nsingle factor affecting nut production. This is because all of our\r\ncommercial nuts now sold in the shell are priced on a basis of size and\r\nthe degree to which they are filled. The size and degree of filling of\r\nthe nuts varies not only from year to year, but from district to\r\ndistrict, orchard to orchard, and even in the same orchard, because nuts\r\nof one variety may fill well and those of another poorly. This is true\r\neven though the kind and variety of nut being produced is grown in a\r\nlocality usually having suitable climatic conditions for normal nut\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Climatic Conditions+\r\n\r\nPrevailing climatic conditions in any locality determine how well a\r\nparticular kind of nut will fill. For example, the pecan is native to\r\nthe southern part of the United States and a small area in northern\r\nMexico. In its native habitat the summers are long and the day and night\r\ntemperatures are uniformly high, with little difference between maximum\r\nand minimum daily temperatures. When the pecan is grown under conditions\r\nof shorter summers, or where there is a marked difference between night\r\nand day temperatures, the nuts do not grow to proper size and the\r\nkernels fill poorly, if at all. Although pecan trees are quite hardy and\r\nmay be grown successfully well north of their native limits, the normal\r\ndevelopment of the nuts and the filling of them cannot be expected\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nGood examples of the climactic effects can be cited. At Davis,\r\nCalifornia, the pecan tree grows, flowers, and sets fruit\r\nsatisfactorily, but the nuts fail to grow to proper size, fill poorly,\r\nand may not mature before frost. At Davis there is an average length of\r\ngrowing season of 242 days; the day temperatures are high, but the night\r\ntemperatures are comparatively low. Pecan trees are hardy even in\r\nConnecticut, but the trees fail to bear because of the short growing\r\nseason and the great difference between day and night temperatures. The\r\npecan is truly a hot weather crop and is not suited for culture under\r\nmountainous conditions. On the other hand it cannot be grown under\r\nsubtropical conditions because of insufficient cold during the winter to\r\nmeet the chilling requirement of the trees. Under such conditions, tree\r\ngrowth starts very late in the spring, and, although the trees may\r\nflower, few nuts may set and those that stick may be very poorly filled\r\nat harvest if they mature.\r\n\r\nThe pecan is probably more exacting in regard to its climactic\r\nrequirements than are our other kinds of nuts, but the filbert or\r\nhazlenut is probably a close second in this respect. The filbert,\r\nhowever, represents the opposite extreme in that it does best under\r\nconditions of mild winter and moderate summer temperatures. These\r\ndifferences are pointed out for the reason that many amateur nut\r\ngrowers want to grow certain nuts outside of their native range in\r\nplaces where unsuitable climatic conditions prevail, and they cannot\r\nunderstand why success is not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Growth and Fruiting Habit of Nut Trees+\r\n\r\nSince the growth and fruiting habits of our different kinds of nut trees\r\nare closely related, it is desirable to point out some of these\r\nrelationships. All of our different species of walnuts, the pecan and\r\nall hickory nuts, as well as hazelnuts and filberts, are borne\r\nterminally on shoots of the current season. In other words all walnut\r\nspecies, pecan, and all hickory species bear the pistillate flowers that\r\ndevelop into nuts at the terminal end of the shoots produced the same\r\nyear that the nuts mature. The staminate or pollen-producing flowers of\r\nall these species arise from lateral buds on shoots that grew the\r\nprevious year. In the case of hazelnut and filbert the pistillate\r\nflowers are borne in lateral buds on shoots of the previous season, as\r\nare also the staminate flowers or catkins. In this case, however, the\r\npistillate flowers are formed and pollinated before the current year's\r\nshoot growth is made. Almonds are borne laterally on shoots produced the\r\nprevious season. All chestnuts are borne laterally on shoots produced\r\nthe same season as the nuts.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut bears most of the staminate flowers separately in staminate\r\ncatkins whereas the pistillate flowers are in mixed catkins, but all are\r\nformed laterally on shoots of the current season. The almond, which has\r\nperfect flowers, produces these in lateral buds on shoots of the\r\nprevious year. Both the hazelnut and the almond flower before any\r\ncurrent-season growth is made, whereas all of the other kinds of nut\r\ntrees mentioned produce almost all normal shoot growth before flowering\r\noccurs. These differences in growth, flowering, and fruiting habits\r\nprovide a basis for the explanation of why growth of almond trees, for\r\nexample, is harder to maintain than is that of walnut or pecan.\r\nFlowering and early development of the fruit before shoot growth is made\r\ntend to check such growth, so that flowering and fruiting trees will not\r\nmake as much new growth as they would have made had flowering and\r\nfruiting been prevented.\r\n\r\nIn general, it can be stated that, in the case of bearing trees, the\r\nlonger the shoot growth and the greater its diameter in proportion to\r\nlength, the greater is the number of pistillate flowers that may be\r\nformed at its terminal. Furthermore, the set of nuts and the size that\r\nthey attain are in proportion to the length and diameter of the shoots\r\nbearing them. In other words, the number of flowers formed, the nuts\r\nset, and the size that they attain are directly correlated with the\r\nvigor and growth of the trees. As trees attain age, fewer long, strong\r\nshoots and more short, weak shoots are formed. Hence the average size of\r\nthe nuts produced decreases because of the reduction in average shoot\r\ngrowth. Furthermore, under normal conditions, the degree to which the\r\nnuts are filled is related to the vigor as it is measured by the length\r\nand diameter of the shoots bearing them. Strong, vigorous shoots usually\r\nproduce the best filled and earliest maturing nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n+What Is a Nut and of What Does It Consist?+\r\n\r\nWebster gives a general definition of a nut as \"a fruit consisting of a\r\nkernel or seed enclosed in a hard woody or leathery shell that does not\r\nopen when ripe, as in the hazel, beech, oak, chestnut.\" Technically\r\nspeaking, it is a hard, indehiscent, one-seeded dry fruit resulting from\r\na compound ovary. In horticultural language the fruit consists of the\r\nhard or leathery nut containing a kernel, together with the husk, hull,\r\nor bur that surrounds the nut shell. This kernel consists of the embryo\r\nplus the endosperm or its remains. In all of our important nuts, such as\r\nwalnuts, pecans, hickory nuts, almonds, and filberts, the kernel is\r\nessentially the embryo with its thickened cotyledons or seed leaves, as\r\nthe endosperm has been absorbed except for a thin membrane.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of its development, growth of the embryo is slow, and\r\nin very early stages it is merely a rounded mass of cells. Later, the\r\nmeristems of the epicotyl (stem or top) and root axis develop, but the\r\nwhole embryo is still microscopic in size. Still later the cotyledons\r\n(seed leaves) start development from the apical meristem and their\r\ngrowth in length is rapid, but they are very thin and follow the\r\ncontours of the seed coat. Growth in length of the cotyledons may be\r\narrested by unfavorable nutritional conditions during the time of\r\nelongation. In such case, the lobes of the cotyledons may not attain the\r\nfull length of the seed coat, or pellicle, which surrounds them. After\r\nthe cotyledons have attained full length, growth in thickness begins in\r\nthe area nearest the epicotyl and proceeds toward the margins. This\r\ngrowth in thickness results from cambium-like meristem with the\r\nformation of new cells. The formation of well developed or solid kernels\r\nthat completely fill the cavity within the shell is dependent upon\r\nmeristematic activity continuing almost to maturity. The weather\r\nconditions, the nutrition of the tree, or other factors that affect the\r\nsynthesis and translocation of elaborated food materials from the leaves\r\nand shoots to the kernels at this time determine the degree to which the\r\ncotyledons are thickened, or in other words how well the nuts are\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Periods of Development+\r\n\r\nIn the development of the nuts there are three periods or stages: (1)\r\nThe period of growth in size; (2) the period of nut filling or\r\ndevelopment of the kernel; (3) the period of maturing.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place during these periods of development determines the size\r\nthe nuts attain, the degree to which they are filled, and finally the\r\nquality at harvest. These three developmental stages are interdependent,\r\nbecause the size of the nuts may affect the degree of filling, and that,\r\nin turn, the time and nature of their maturity. They are not entirely\r\nseparate and distinct but overlap in that there is more or less\r\ndevelopment of the kernel, varying with the species, while the nuts are\r\ngrowing in size. In general, however, there is not appreciable kernel\r\ndevelopment until after the nuts have attained approximately full size,\r\nexcept in the chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding example of this situation is the pecan. There is\r\npractically no growth of the kernel until after the shell of the nut has\r\nstarted to become hard. At that time growth of the embryo, which\r\nconstitutes the kernel, become rapid. The major portion of the kernel is\r\nformed during a period of approximately one month, starting at\r\nBeltsville, Maryland about the middle of September. The final stages of\r\nfilling occur just before the nuts mature, and the first nuts to fall\r\nusually have the best filled kernels. Later maturing nuts are generally\r\npoorly filled; their shells and kernels are often discolored, and the\r\nshucks fail to open properly, if at all.\r\n\r\nThe development of walnuts, hickory nuts, and filberts, so far as is\r\nknown, is in all essentials the same as that described for the pecan nut\r\nexcept that the kernel or embryo begins to grow somewhat earlier in the\r\nseason. However, the major portion of the filling, which consists in the\r\nthickening of the cotyledons, takes place late in the season, and only a\r\nmonth or a little more before the nuts mature.\r\n\r\nThe period of the maturing of the nuts generally closely follows the\r\ncompletion of the filling of the kernels. During this period in the\r\npecan, certain other species of hickory, the Persian walnut, chestnut,\r\nand others, food reserves are transferred from shucks, hulls, or burs to\r\nthe nuts. Abscission layers are formed and shucks, hulls, or burs split\r\nopen on drying out, thus partially or wholly releasing the nuts. There\r\nis a very direct relationship between the degree to which the nuts are\r\nfilled and their time of and normality of maturing; well filled nuts\r\nmature early and normally, whereas poorly filled nuts mature late, if at\r\nall, and shucks, hulls, or burs fail to open properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Growth in Size+\r\n\r\nThe size of the nuts produced by a tree is determined by a number of\r\nfactors, one or all of which may operate during the course of the\r\nseason. These are: (1) Age of tree; (2) position of the nuts on the\r\ntree; (3) fertility of the soil and moisture supply, or the nutritional\r\nstatus of the tree; (4) size of the crop borne.\r\n\r\nIn general, old trees bear smaller nuts than do younger trees. Hence\r\nsize of nut for a particular variety is only relative. The first few\r\ncrops produced by a tree usually consist of nuts large in size for the\r\nvariety; and then, as the tree attains age, nuts become smaller in size.\r\nYoung trees make longer and thicker shoot growth than do older trees.\r\nThere is, then, under normal conditions, a direct relationship between\r\nthe growth made by a tree and the size that the nuts attain. The more\r\nvigorous trees not only produce larger nuts than those produced by less\r\nvigorous trees, but the hulls and shells of such nuts are thicker and\r\nconstitute a higher total percentage of the total weight of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe position of the nuts on a tree has an important effect on the size\r\nthat they ultimately attain. In general, the nuts in the top are larger\r\nthan those nearer the ground; and those on the strongest and most\r\nvigorous shoots of the top or lateral branches will attain a larger size\r\nunder normal conditions than those located on weaker and shorter shoots\r\nor on the inside of the tree. Here again there is a direct relationship\r\nbetween growth of the tree and growth in size of nuts. All normal trees\r\nmake longer and stronger shoot growth in the top than they do on the\r\nterminals of lateral branches, and the shortest and weaker shoots as\r\nwell as the smallest nuts are generally on the lateral branches inside\r\nof the tree top.\r\n\r\nFertility of soil and moisture supply determine in large measure both\r\nthe growth made by the tree and the size of nuts. The nuts borne on\r\ntrees growing on fertile soils adequately supplied with moisture are\r\ngenerally much larger in size than those borne by trees on infertile\r\nsoil or soil poorly supplied with soil moisture. Deficiency of either\r\nnitrogen, or moisture, or both is particularly effective in limiting the\r\nsize of nuts produced. Pecans grown under soil conditions in which both\r\nnitrogen and moisture were deficient have been known to attain only\r\nabout one-fourth the size of nuts of the same varieties grown in the\r\nsame orchard but under conditions of clean cultivation and supplementary\r\nnitrogen applications. A prolonged drought during the time that the nuts\r\nare increasing in size very frequently causes them to be much smaller\r\nthan they would have been had the moisture supply been adequate.\r\n\r\nThe size of the crop borne by a tree determines in a very large measure\r\nthe size that the nuts attain at maturity. There is generally an inverse\r\nrelationship also between the number of nuts borne in a cluster on a\r\nshoot and the size they attain. In this respect nut crops are little\r\ndifferent from apples and peaches, which, too, are sold on the basis of\r\nsize. In order to produce fruits of large size having a high market\r\nvalue, the crops are thinned in years of a heavy set of fruit. In the\r\ncase of pecans, for example, thinning the crop at the time the nuts are\r\ngrowing in size on heavily producing trees is a very effective method of\r\nincreasing the average size of the nuts allowed to remain on the trees.\r\nThe earlier the thinning is done the more effective it is; however, it\r\nwill increase the size of the nuts even when done as late as when the\r\nshells have started to become hard. No practical and economical method\r\nof thinning the crop of nuts has as yet been found; nevertheless it is\r\nwell to bear in mind that a large crop borne by a tree generally means\r\nreduced average size of the nuts at harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Filling or Development of the Kernels+\r\n\r\nIn general, the fruits (nuts) of a nut-bearing tree are what might be\r\ntermed storage organs. In them are stored mineral elements and such\r\nelaborated food materials as carbohydrates (sugars and starch), oil,\r\namino acids, and proteins that have been removed from the leaves and\r\nwood of the tree. These materials are stored for future use of the\r\nembryo in the nut to sustain respiration, to permit germination, and to\r\nmaintain the seedling until it has produced enough leaf area to become\r\nself-sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked, why is it so important that nuts be well\r\nfilled? The answer is very simple, because the quality of the oily nuts\r\nis determined by how well the kernels are filled. All but one of our\r\nmost important nuts--almonds, filberts, hickory nuts, pecans, and\r\nwalnuts--are oily nuts; and well filled kernels contain from 50 to 75\r\npercent or more of oil, depending upon the species. Chestnuts are\r\nstarchy nuts and contain less than one percent of oil. The relationship\r\nbetween the degree of filling and the composition of the kernel in oily\r\nnuts is outstanding, in that the better filled nuts have a higher\r\ncontent of oil and a lower content of protein, carbohydrates, water, and\r\nundetermined constituents than do poorly filled nuts. Highest quality of\r\nthe kernels is directly associated with highest oil content and highest\r\ndegree of filling. Nut kernels that are poorly filled are often hollow,\r\nshrunken, shriveled, and chaffy. When eaten they may taste sweet, but\r\nare lacking in the oily flavor characteristic of the particular species\r\nof nut eaten. It is only in the best filled nuts that highest quality,\r\nflavor, and oil content are found.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which nuts are filled or how well the kernels are\r\ndeveloped at harvest is determined by a rather large number of\r\ninterrelated factors: (1) Size of crop, or ratio of number of leaves per\r\nnut; (2) average size of nuts; (3) condition of leaves; (4) amount of\r\nsecond growth of the trees; (5) size of preceding crop and how well the\r\nnuts produced were filled; (6) disease and insect injury to the nuts;\r\n(7) weather conditions; (8) heterosis or effect of cross-pollination on\r\nembryo size.\r\n\r\n+Size of crop:+ Nut growers want their trees to bear large annual crops of\r\nnuts. It is very seldom that one hears a nut grower express the opinion\r\nthat a certain tree is carrying too many nuts for the crop to attain\r\nproper size and fill well, yet this is very often the case. Furthermore,\r\nthe production of a large crop of poorly filled nuts one year is almost\r\ncertain to result in a light crop or none at all the following year.\r\nThere is a very close inverse relation between the size of the crop\r\nproduced and the degree to which the nuts are filled at harvest, namely,\r\nthe larger the crop the less the nuts will be filled. It has been\r\npointed out above that nuts are storage organs, and the food materials\r\nrequired to grow and fill them must be made in the leaves. When too many\r\nnuts are set and carried through to the filling period, in proportion to\r\nthe number of leaves or the leaf area of the tree, it is not possible\r\nfor the leaves to synthesize the large amount of food materials required\r\nto fill the nuts. In pecans, for example, it has been shown that six to\r\neight leaves are required normally to fill a nut properly and 10 or more\r\nleaves per nut if the tree is to flower and set a crop the following\r\nyear. Other ratios for number of leaves or leaf area exist with other\r\nkinds of nuts. It is general experience that large crops of nuts remove\r\nsuch large amounts of food materials and minerals from the trees that a\r\nlight crop or no crop at all is produced the following year. This is\r\nespecially true if the nuts are not especially well filled in the \"on\r\ncrop year.\"\r\n\r\n+Size of nuts:+ Almost everyone prefers large nuts to small ones, and that\r\nis one reason, why the larger sizes command a higher price on the\r\nmarkets. Many remember how popular the McCallister hican was a number of\r\nyears ago because of its extremely large size. Such varieties of the\r\npecan as Nelson and Mahan were very popular because the nuts produced\r\nwere generally much larger than those of other varieties. These\r\nvarieties remained popular until experience in growing them showed that\r\nthey were very often poorly filled at harvest. As a general rule, large\r\nnuts are more difficult to fill properly than small nuts. This is\r\nobvious, because much more food material must be made by the leaves and\r\ntransported to fill the kernels of large nuts than is required to fill\r\nan equal number of nuts of smaller size. In seasons with conditions\r\nfavorable for both tree growth and growth in size of the nuts, it is\r\noften the experience that the nuts are poorly filled at harvest. On the\r\nother hand, if the weather is dry during the period in which the nuts\r\nare growing in size, they are much more likely to be well filled at\r\nmaturity. In fact, the writer has seen several instances in which,\r\nbecause of severe drought in the spring, pecans were undersized, yet the\r\nkernels developed and filled so well that the shells of the nuts cracked\r\nat maturity.\r\n\r\n+Condition of leaves:+ To produce well filled nuts, nut trees must bear a\r\nlarge leaf area and the leaves must be in good health and vigor. If they\r\nare to produce annual crops, the trees must carry their leaves until\r\ncold weather in the late fall, undamaged by insects or diseases. The\r\nimportance of a large leaf area free from injury or abnormal condition\r\nis so great that it can hardly be overemphasized in connection with nut\r\nproduction. It can be definitely stated that under normal conditions the\r\nsize of the crop produced and the degree to which the nuts are filled is\r\ndirectly related to the leaf area and the length of time it is carried\r\nby the tree.\r\n\r\nIf the leaf area is to be large, the trees must make good, strong,\r\nvigorous shoot growth, and this means that proper attention must be\r\ngiven to fertilization to insure that the trees have adequate amounts\r\nof nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, zinc, and boron, as well as all other\r\nessential elements. The elements mentioned have been found most likely\r\nto be deficient in the soils of eastern and southern United States. In\r\nthose regions their lack may be expected most frequently to limit tree\r\ngrowth or the filling of the nuts because of their effects on the leaves\r\nand the consequent inability of the leaves to make food materials.\r\nDeficiency of one or more of these elements results in leaves that are\r\nnot able to make food materials in anywhere near such amounts as do\r\nnormal leaves well supplied with all essential elements. In severe\r\ncases, deficiency of one or more of these elements results in chlorosis\r\nof the leaves, still later in leaf scorch, and finally in premature leaf\r\nfall. Trees having leaves in such condition cannot be expected to fill\r\nthe nuts borne by them.\r\n\r\nMost nut trees grown about home or farmstead are deficient in nitrogen,\r\nas the trees must compete with grass, weeds, shrubbery, or other trees.\r\nFrequently there is not enough plant food for all. A deficiency of\r\nnitrogen limits the growth and the leaf area carried by a tree. A\r\ndeficiency of potassium or magnesium very greatly limits the amount of\r\nfood material made by the leaves and hence greatly decreases the filling\r\nand the oil content of the kernels. Zinc or boron deficiency has a\r\nsimilar effect.\r\n\r\nHence, to insure the production of well filled nuts, one must be certain\r\nthat the trees are well fertilized and that the fertilizer elements\r\napplied are in proper balance one with the others.\r\n\r\nInjury to the leaves resulting from attacks by diseases and insects is\r\none of the most common and important causes of poorly filled nuts. Every\r\nspecies and variety of tree nut suffers from at least one disease or\r\ninsect pest that damages the leaves and hence limits or curtails the\r\namount of elaborated food materials they can make. In most cases the\r\nfungi or bacteria causing foliage diseases infect the leaves in early\r\nspring at the time they are unfolding and growing in size, although the\r\ninfection may not be noticeable until later. These infected areas, even\r\nthough they are small and not numerous enough to cause the leaf to fall,\r\nseriously impair the functioning of the leaf out of all proportion to\r\nthe area directly affected. Should the infection be so severe as to\r\ncause premature defoliation, the damage will be great even though only a\r\nsmall percentage of the leaves falls. The disease of eastern Mack walnut\r\nknown as leaf spot, or anthracnose, is one of these defoliating diseases\r\nthat causes untold damage from poorly filled nuts in the current crop\r\nyear, and results in a small crop or none at all the following year. The\r\ndevelopment and spread of these diseases is gradual, and unsuspecting\r\ngrowers do not realize the damage they cause.\r\n\r\nOn other hand, the injuries caused by such insects as the webworm, the\r\nwalnut caterpillar, the pecan leaf case-bearer, the Japanese beetle, and\r\nothers are somewhat spectacular in that the leaves may be partly or\r\ncompletely consumed on portions of the trees. The injury caused by the\r\nwalnut aphis, the walnut lace bug, the pecan black aphis, and others, on\r\nthe other hand, is less conspicuous; but the end result is far more\r\nserious than it usually is with the leaf eating insects, because the\r\ndamage caused is more widespread, almost all of the leaves on a tree\r\nbeing affected. These sucking insects are small in size and may be\r\noverlooked until premature defoliation takes place. If nut trees are to\r\nbear satisfactory crops of well filled nuts, the diseases and insects\r\nthat attack and cause injury to the leaves must be controlled. Under\r\nnormal conditions the size of the crop produced, the regularity of\r\nbearing, and the quality of the nuts harvested is proportional to the\r\nleaf area of normal leaves carried by the tree from early spring until\r\nfreezing-weather in the fall.\r\n\r\n+Second growth of the trees:+ Certain of our nut trees, such as pecan and\r\nwalnuts, under some conditions have two or perhaps more periods of shoot\r\ngrowth during the same growing season. The first, or main period of\r\ngrowth, starts at the time of foliation in the spring and ends soon\r\nafter the shoots flower. The second period of growth, if it occurs, may\r\nbegin any time after the nuts are set, and may end any time later. This\r\nsecond growth seriously affects the filling of the nuts, in that food\r\nmaterials are consumed in producing this second growth rather than in\r\nthe growth and filling of the nuts. Generally this second growth is not\r\nmade until late in the season, and it usually follows a period of dry\r\nweather, when conditions again become favorable for growth. Usually this\r\nis at the time the kernels should be developing, and hence the degree of\r\nfilling is affected. The seriousness of the effect on the filling of the\r\nnuts is largely proportional to the amount and duration of this second\r\ngrowth. A third period of growth may occur later if weather conditions\r\nare suitable.\r\n\r\n+Preceding crop:+ It has already been pointed out that nuts are storage\r\norgans and in their growth and development large amounts of food\r\nmaterials and minerals are removed from the tree. Under conditions of\r\nheavy crop production, the reserves of these materials left in the tree\r\nat the time of harvest are likely to be very low; and unless the trees\r\nare growing on a fertile soil and carry their leaves until frost, these\r\nreserves of minerals and elaborated food materials are not likely to be\r\nrestored. Under such conditions, in the following spring the reserves\r\nare low and although there may be enough to initiate flowering and the\r\nset of nuts, they are not sufficiently high to produce well filled nuts.\r\nIt is for this reason that the nuts produced in an \"off crop year,\" even\r\nthough the crop may be much lighter, may be less well filled than those\r\nproduced in an \"on crop year.\"\r\n\r\nSuch nuts as pecans, hickory nuts, and walnuts transfer large amounts of\r\npotassium from the tree itself into the shucks or hulls. The kernels of\r\nsuch nuts are high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and magnesium as well as in\r\noil, which is one of the most concentrated food materials and has the\r\nhighest calorie value. Nitrogen reserves in the trees are readily and\r\nrather quickly replaced if adequate amounts are applied, as this element\r\nis not fixed by the soil. This is not true of phosphorus and potassium,\r\nas they are apparently taken up by the trees much more slowly than is\r\nnitrogen. Furthermore, certain soils have a high fixing power for these\r\nelements and hence they are slowly, if at all, available.\r\n\r\n+Insect and disease damage to the nuts:+ Certain insects and diseases\r\nattack the nuts, causing them to be poorly filled at harvest. Although\r\nthese pests may destroy, or cause a certain percentage of the crop to\r\ndrop before harvest, and hence serve as a thinning measure, the affected\r\nnuts remaining on the tree may not be well filled at maturity. Examples\r\nof such insects are the pecan or hickory shuck worm, the walnut husk\r\nmaggot, and the codling moth. Infestations by these insects occurring\r\nbefore the shells of the nuts have become hard cause the nuts to drop.\r\nHowever, infestations taking place after the nut shells have become hard\r\ndo not cause the nuts to drop. These late-infested nuts may be poorly\r\nfilled because the insect larvae mine the hulls or shucks, severing the\r\nconducting tissues that transport food materials from the fruit stem or\r\npeduncle through the shuck to the kernel. The damage caused not only\r\nresults in poorly filled nuts but also interferes with the natural\r\nseparation of the shucks or hulls from the shells.\r\n\r\nExamples of diseases that attack the nuts and cause them to be poorly\r\nfilled at harvest are pecan scab and walnut bacteriosis. Pecan scab may\r\nalso attack other species of hickory. It is the most destructive pecan\r\ndisease, causing a high percentage of the nuts on highly susceptible\r\nvarieties to drop prematurely and those that stick to the tree to be\r\npoorly filled at harvest. Walnut bacteriosis or blight is the most\r\nimportant walnut disease in the West and unless controlled causes severe\r\nlosses from premature drop or from nuts both poorly filled and having\r\ndiscolored kernels at harvest. It is obvious that if large crops of well\r\nfilled nuts are to be produced, these insects and diseases must be\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n+Weather conditions:+ Many growers are inclined to blame the weather for\r\nall small crops and poor nut quality because they realize it can have\r\nsuch important effects. In reality its direct effects are generally much\r\nless than they are thought to be, and its indirect effects are usually\r\nmuch greater than is usually realized. Weather conditions have a very\r\ngreat effect on the development of insects and diseases and on the\r\ndamage caused by them, so that most often these are of major importance.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that a prolonged drought may adversely\r\naffect the size of nuts when it occurs while they are growing in size.\r\nSimilarly, the degree to which nuts are filled at harvest is affected by\r\nthe moisture supply during the filling period. A moisture deficiency\r\nwithin the tree probably affects the translocation of food materials to\r\nthe nuts to a greater extent than it affects leaf functioning, for under\r\nsuch conditions the leaves will withdraw so much water from the\r\ndeveloping nuts that the shucks and hulls become wilted. Under\r\nconditions of prolonged drought the kernels do not fill properly,\r\nmaturity of the nuts is delayed, and the shucks or hulls do not open\r\nnormally.\r\n\r\nUnder drought conditions the temperatures of the air and of surfaces\r\nexposed to the sun are often very high, and this sometimes results in\r\nsun-scald or burning of the hulls or shucks. In severe cases the injury\r\nextends through the hull or shuck to the shell and kernels. The\r\npellicle, or skin of the kernel, turns brown or amber color, as does the\r\nportion of the kernel that has developed at the time of injury. Further\r\ndevelopment of the affected portion of the kernel is arrested; and on\r\ndrying it becomes shriveled because of lack of filling. The greatest\r\namount of damage from sunburn occurs on the south and southwest sides of\r\nthe trees. Little can be done to prevent this type of injury other than\r\nto grow good, strong, vigorous trees that bear a heavy dense foliage\r\nthat shades the nuts.\r\n\r\n+Heterosis or hybrid vigor:+ The pistillate flowers of certain nut\r\nspecies, such as the almond, chestnuts, and filberts, must be\r\ncross-pollinated with pollen from another variety if satisfactorily\r\ncrops of well filled nuts are to be produced. These species are\r\nself-sterile or self-unfruitful. On the other hand all walnut, pecan,\r\nand hickory species are self-fertile and cross-fertile, but may be\r\nself-unfruitful because of dichogamy, because they may shed their pollen\r\neither before or after the stigmas of the pistillate flowers are\r\nreceptive to it. In all nut species cross-pollination is generally\r\nrecommended so as to assure a set of nuts. With cross-pollination a\r\nbetter set of nuts is to be expected than with self-pollination, as well\r\nas better filling of the kernels. It has recently been found that when\r\nthe pistillate flowers of a certain variety are cross-pollinated with a\r\npollen from another definite variety the embryo or nut kernel is larger\r\nand better filled. This is a manifestation of hybrid vigor, or\r\nheterosis. Heterosis has been found in the chestnut and in the pecan. It\r\nlikely will be found in other nut species. Some day the principles of\r\nselected and controlled parentage underlying hybrid vigor may be\r\nutilized in producing superior nuts, as these principals are now so\r\nwidely used in producing hybrid seed corn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That paper was so extremely important that I\r\nhesitated very much to stop it, but we are already at the point where we\r\nshould have adjourned. Now, unfortunately, we have some very important\r\nthings, I think, yet before us, but if the speakers can give their talks\r\nfrom now on in the form of, shall we say, syntheses of the whole thing\r\nand give us the conclusions rather than the details, it will be\r\nappreciated by us all. Mr. Wilkinson is going to give us a very\r\nimportant talk on what he has done with the propagation of the Lamb\r\ncurly walnut. Mr. Wilkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grafted Curly Walnut as a Timber Tree\r\n\r\nJ. FORD WILKINSON, Rockport, Indiana\r\n\r\n\r\nOur native trees are and have always been one of the most valuable\r\nresources of this country, and one of the greatest heritages ever to\r\nfall to a nation.\r\n\r\nWood has been used by our people since the landing of the Pilgrims, for\r\nalmost every comfort and purpose in life, from the making of cradles to\r\ncaskets.\r\n\r\nWood is still one of the principal materials in building homes and\r\nfurniture, and is used for railroad ties, for paper, and in so many\r\nother ways that we could scarcely get along without wood.\r\n\r\nThe United States is the native home of many species of trees, of which\r\na number are superior in some certain ways for some special purposes.\r\nThe hickory has no equal for ax handles. As a building-timber where\r\nstrength and durability are needed the oak ranks among the first. Other\r\nspecies are equally as important for some other uses.\r\n\r\nNot to be overlooked are nut trees. They serve the twofold purpose of\r\nproducing both food for man and wild life, and valuable timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Black Walnut Has Great Value+\r\n\r\nOf the nut tree group, the black walnut is one of the most important. It\r\nranks among the first for lumber, furniture, cabinets, and finishing\r\nmaterial. It has no rival in use for gun stocks and airplane propellers;\r\nas walnut wood is light, strong, will not get rough, but wears smoother\r\nwith use. Neither will it splinter when pierced by a bullet. Walnut wood\r\nhas been largely responsible, at times, for keeping us a nation of free\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut tree is an aristocrat of forest and field. It can\r\njustly be proud, for no other tree can fill its place. As the late\r\nauthor A. H. Marks said, \"Who has not noticed the look of contended\r\nusefulness which a nut-bearing tree wears? It is of use to the world and\r\nknows it.\"\r\n\r\nWalnuts, like other species of trees, are not all alike, either as to\r\nnut production or in the grain of the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Lamb Black Walnut+\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago an unusually highly figured, and very valuable,\r\nblack walnut tree was discovered by Mr. George N. Lamb, then\r\nSecretary-Treasurer of the American Walnut Manufacturers Association of\r\nChicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\nWhen the logs from this tree came into the mill, and their value was\r\nrealized, Mr. Lamb went to the place where the tree had grown. He\r\nsecured some twigs from the branches of this top and sent these, as I\r\nhave been informed, to Dr. Robert T. Morris and Mr. Willard G. Bixby,\r\nknowing of their interest in propagating better varieties of nut trees.\r\n\r\nThis wood had been taken from the top many days after the tree was\r\nfelled, and so was dry and nearly dead. I believe Dr. Morris succeeded\r\nin getting only one graft to grow, and Mr. Bixby two. This variety was\r\nthen named in honor of Mr. Lamb.\r\n\r\nSeveral years later Mr. Bixby sent me a very small stick of graft wood\r\nfrom one of his trees, from which I made two grafts. One of them grew,\r\ngiving me a start of this variety. I have annually propagated a few\r\ntrees of it ever since, though with little encouragement, and even much\r\ndiscouragement from others, including State and U. S. Government\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I thought I practically had an order for a quantity of\r\nthese Lamb walnut trees for a reforestation project. However, the\r\nprospective purchaser, before placing his final order, wrote to\r\ngovernment authorities, then wrote me as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\" ... Sept. 30, 1940 ...\r\n\r\n\"Following some investigation in connection with the so-called curly\r\nwalnut varieties, we have been advised by government authorities that\r\nthese trees do not form, or grow into, a curly walnut tree at any time\r\nduring the growing stage.\r\n\r\n\"We took it for granted that the wood formation would be of a curly\r\nnature, and for that reason we were interested in that particular\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\"In view of this information which we have concerning these trees, we\r\nwould not be interested in growing them as we have plenty of native\r\nblack walnut here....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis and other discouragements, from both government authorities and\r\nindividuals, had about as much effect on me as King George's advice to\r\nthe American people not to use tobacco; they smoked calmly on, and I\r\ncontinued to propagate Lamb curly black walnut trees.\r\n\r\nI have been propagating nut trees since 1910, and have never yet known\r\none of my propagated nut trees to fail to carry the characteristics of\r\nthe parent tree, as to habits of growth, bark, bud formation, foliage,\r\ntexture of wood, or quality of nuts. The Deming Purple walnut tree, when\r\nasexually propagated, reproduces the purple wood, so I reasoned the Lamb\r\nvariety would reproduce figured wood. Nature seldom blunders.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Value of Original Lamb Walnut Tree+\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a few years ago, doing some tree\r\nwork for the late William J. Wallace, he took me a few miles to the\r\nlocation of the original Lamb tree. It was near a small river in a\r\ngravel loam soil near Ada, Kent County, Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract of a letter received from Mr. Lamb as to the\r\noriginal tree:\r\n\r\n\"November 27, 1929\r\n\r\n   Lamb Figured Walnut--\r\n   Cut into veneers @ 6 to 18c per sq. ft. (1/28\")\r\n   Use: Furniture\r\n   Amount of veneers 60627' [Value: $8,637.62 to $10,918.86 (Prewar!)--Ed.]\r\n   Logs produced:\r\n    8' x 21\"--144 Log Ft.\r\n    6' x 18\"-- 73  \"   \"\r\n   10' x 36\"--640  \"   \"\r\n   14' x 30\"--591  \"   \"\r\n   10' x 32\"--490  \"   \"\r\n   Stump    --500  \"   \"\r\n            _____\r\n\r\n             2438\r\n\r\n   Location of tree--Ada, Kent County, Michigan.\r\n   Location--River flat 20 rods from river.\r\n   Soil-Gravel loam.\r\n   Type of tree--Open grown.\r\n   Shape---Double stump.\r\n   Height--40 ft.\r\n   Figure--Throughout the tree.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lamb further states in his letter: \"Unquestionably it was one of the\r\nmost thoroughly figured trees ever discovered, and if figured wood will\r\npropagate itself this stock should, certainly should, do so.\"\r\n\r\nHe further states, \"The figure in this tree was quite apparent, even in\r\nthe small branches, while the Forest Products Laboratory found evidence\r\nof a developing figure in the twigs not over five years old.\"\r\n\r\nThe wood specimens I now have on exhibit here were taken from one of my\r\n12-year-old grafted trees that I cut, and in them you will find figure\r\nvisible to the naked eye, or easily noticeable by touching with a\r\nfinger, in wood from branches not over 7 years old.\r\n\r\nComparing age at which figure shows in the wood of the two trees, this\r\nyoung tree seems to be developing figure at an early age, as in the\r\nparent tree.\r\n\r\nMy confidence in this outcome had never been shaken by the doubts of\r\nothers. Few seemed to share this belief with me, and for this reason I\r\nhave never pushed the sale of Lamb trees. Now I do not hesitate to state\r\nthat curly figure will reproduce in any propagated Lamb trees, as the\r\nevidence before you here is stronger than any argument.\r\n\r\nOne purpose of the Northern Nut Growers Association is to encourage the\r\nperpetuation by propagation of the better varieties of nut trees. I\r\nconsider the Lamb variety one of the best walnut trees known from a\r\ntimber point of view, and until a better variety is found I shall\r\ncontinue to propagate Lamb black walnut trees.\r\n\r\n+Ed. note:+ The nuts on Lamb trees, as seen at Norris, Tennessee, during\r\nthis meeting, appear to be of at least average size and have better\r\nthan average shell structure. They probably would be well adapted to\r\nmachine-cracking. Thus the Lamb would not be a bad variety to grow for\r\nits nuts. Or we could double-work the trees, to have each tree with a\r\ngood trunk of the Lamb wood growing beneath a fruiting top of any\r\ndesired walnut variety. One or two of our members already have made a\r\nstart on this latter scheme of propagation.\r\n\r\n+Author's Note:+ The Lamb variety is a rapid and upright grower and should\r\nbe well adapted as a stock for the purpose suggested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I don't think one can minimize the importance of\r\nwhat Mr. Wilkinson has done with the Lamb curly walnut. There are\r\npossibilities here that are of immense value to those who are interested\r\nin timber. Now, I am very, very sorry to put off the rest of this\r\nprogram until this afternoon. Possibly we can work a part of it then.\r\nMeantime, we had better adjourn.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase says that he has arranged for a group picture to be taken at\r\nthe Community Building at one o'clock. Let's everyone be there at one\r\no'clock. That means, of course, that you are going to cut the sandwich\r\nand coffee pretty short.\r\n\r\nAll right, let's adjourn.\r\n\r\n(Luncheon recess was taken.)\r\n\r\n\r\n+Tuesday Afternoon Session+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Come to order, please. The first speaker on the\r\nafternoon program is Mr. Shivery. I think I will get Mr. Chase to say a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Our next speaker is Mr. George Shivery, Extension Forester\r\nfor the University of Tennessee, and I know that the interest of this\r\nAssociation is in the planting of improved black walnuts, and I simply\r\ncan say this man arranged for the planting of more Thomas walnut trees\r\nthan any other man in the world. George Shivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Black Walnut Situation in Tennessee\r\n\r\nGEORGE B. SHIVERY, Extension Forester, University of Tennessee,\r\nKnoxville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Shivery: Mr. Chairman and members of the Association: I certainly\r\nappreciate that compliment made by Mr. Chase, and I want to assure all\r\nof you that we certainly are interested in the black walnut in\r\nTennessee. In the past we have had to depend pretty much on the wild\r\nblack walnut, and we will for years in the future. But we have done\r\neverything possible to get distribution on this Thomas improved black\r\nwalnut which has been propagated here through the efforts of Mr. Chase,\r\nMr. Zarger and other members in his division.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that this black walnut kernel industry is sort of a\r\ntradition, particularly in East Tennessee. If you have lived in this\r\nstate as long as I have, you have become curious about its history.\r\nWell, in the early days there were no railroads in this state, and\r\ncommerce moved pretty much by means of wagon team, and the supply center\r\nseemed to be Baltimore, Maryland. Now, I can visualize very well that\r\non outbound trips they doubtless carried black walnut kernels, and on\r\nthe way in, of course, they'd bring clothing and other materials that\r\nwere not produced here at home.\r\n\r\nIn the early days they produced tremendous amounts of maple sugar and\r\nmaple syrup. Doubtless this was consumed at home and nowadays we don't\r\nhave any evidence of that, because the climatic conditions in New York\r\nState and other northern states and New England are much better suited\r\nto the flow of the sap. The weather, I believe, is not so changeable up\r\nthere. Our weather is changeable. We may have a very severe cold week,\r\nand then in ten days it will be balmy and pretty weather. We haven't\r\nmade any effort to bring back the sugar maple industry. We don't\r\nconsider it economic in this state, because cane sugar in the past has\r\nbeen cheap in price, and then we have another product that some of you\r\nmay not be familiar with, sorghum molasses. That serves as dessert lots\r\nof times in many meals, hot biscuits and sorghum to finish up the meal.\r\n\r\nNow, I might mention something about the size of the black walnut\r\nindustry in this state. We estimate that there are eight million pounds\r\nof uncracked whole walnuts produced on the average in a normal crop year\r\nin Tennessee, and there is another five million pounds that is never\r\ngathered, never hulled, never enters the market, never used, and the\r\nvalue of this crop in a normal year would be around $750,000. That is\r\nfor the nuts, the fruit, the kernels. If you speak of timber it will\r\namount to $960,000. That is in the form of lumber and veneers, and if\r\nyou figure that in the form of a log at the shipping point, we'd reduce\r\nthat figure and say it would be $480,000.\r\n\r\nI think to understand this state you have to give some consideration to\r\nphysiographic regions, and if you will bear with me I'd like to sketch\r\nthrough these regions of the state, because they have a bearing on\r\nproduction of black walnut. Here in the east we have the East Tennessee\r\nMountains, and proceeding westward we have the Great Valley of East\r\nTennessee. It goes all the way down to Chattanooga, up through Bristol,\r\non up through Virginia to Hagerstown, Maryland, all the way up to\r\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWe have fine soil, and we also have different kinds of shale in that\r\nvalley. Then we proceed westward. We come to the Cumberland Plateau, and\r\nthe elevation of this plateau is around 2,000 feet. It is higher than\r\nthis valley. Then we cross that and we reach this area (indicating on\r\nmap). That is what we call the Highland Rim. That is made up of\r\nlimestone soil of a different character, usually, than that in this East\r\nTennessee valley. That is what we term the Eastern Highland Rim, and\r\nthis around here (indicating) we term the Western Highland Rim. And this\r\nred portion would be the Central Basin in which Nashville is situated.\r\nThen you would travel through this central elevation, come up on the\r\nWestern Highland Rim, and then you come up here and you cross the\r\nTennessee River flowing north. Then you get into West Tennessee.\r\n\r\nNow, that is coastal plain soil, and as you approach the Mississippi\r\nRiver here you have a covering of what the Germans call loess, fine,\r\nwind-blown material, silt loam. So that very sketchily gives you some\r\nidea of the physiographic regions in this state.\r\n\r\nNow you want to know where these black walnuts are grown. Well, up about\r\nhere (indicating the northeast) we have the towns of Greeneville and\r\nRogersville and Morristown and Jonesboro, the counties of Washington\r\nCounty, Greene County, Hawkins County, say, ten counties; radiating\r\naround those ten counties you have in the past had great quantities of\r\nwalnut kernels produced and sold. Now, go on down this valley past\r\nKnoxville, and McMinn County (southeast) has some years produced heavy\r\ncrops of walnuts. So you have heavy production all through the valley.\r\n\r\nThere's another center, we might term it, of about six counties in this\r\ncentral basin. But I don't want you to get the wrong impression, because\r\nwalnuts grow in almost any county in this state, but I am mentioning\r\nthese greater producing areas. And this County of Williamson south of\r\nNashville in years past has sent plenty of walnuts to market. So that's\r\na walnut producing area. And up here in this Highland Rim we have some\r\ncounties by the name of Pickett and Overton and Clay County. Well, they\r\nproduce walnuts, and the people up there have in the past cracked out a\r\nlot of walnuts. And in Montgomery County they produce walnuts. So the\r\nnormal trade centers where these walnuts move is really to a great\r\ndegree here at this town of Morristown in East Tennessee, and Nashville\r\nin Middle Tennessee, and this Middle Tennessee center draws from\r\nKentucky. In fact, these four or five large shelling concerns know about\r\nthe walnuts pretty much all over the entire walnut producing territory.\r\n\r\nThrough the years the Agricultural Extension Service, University of\r\nTennessee, with which I am connected, has been keenly interested in\r\nassisting in any way we can to get additional income out of walnut\r\nkernels, and in recent years the whole uncracked walnut. And even though\r\nI am a forester I can see the possibilities of this, and we like to\r\ncarry it along. In fact, I consider walnut as kind of a dual-purpose\r\ntree, fine for timber production, also for production of nuts, walnut\r\nmeats or kernels. You might term it a triple-purpose tree. I don't think\r\nthere is any better tree than that for a shade tree in pastures, in the\r\nfield, and around the home, because for one reason it makes what we term\r\nin this state a \"cold shade,\" and it is not a hot shade like you get\r\nunder a sugar maple. The maple has a dense foliage. And as Mr. Chance\r\nindicated this morning, walnut is usually associated with blue grass.\r\nBlue grass will grow under it.\r\n\r\nI guess some of you here remember the years of the depression, and I\r\nremember in 1932, for example, we had a heavy crop of black walnuts in\r\nthe state. Then I believe the price for kernels of 15 cents a pound\r\nwould have been a good price during that year, and some of them probably\r\nsold for less. So if we had the time we would follow through all the\r\nyears, beginning with 1927, but just to make it as brief as possible, I\r\nwill leave those out, but I would like to mention the year 1941. It sort\r\nof disrupted things in the kernel industry, because at that time the\r\nPure Food and Drug people came in here and set up regulations, and it\r\ninterfered with the merchandising of these kernels, because the producer\r\nhad to satisfy certain sanitary regulations, and it really sounded worse\r\nthan it was. Anyway, it confused our people, and probably that is about\r\nthe year in which we had this big shift from the production of walnut\r\nkernels cracked out at home to a sale of uncracked walnuts to these\r\nshelling plants.\r\n\r\nThen another year that I think of (we always think of these as walnut\r\ncrop years) was 1945, and that year we got better prices, probably, than\r\never before or since, and a lot of our country people were able to sell\r\nhulled uncracked walnuts as high as $6 per hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to be interested in this industry, but, of course,\r\nnowadays the wage scale is higher and money is not worth as much as it\r\nwas in the past, so it really seems to me that in order to get out this\r\ncrop we just have to try to make the price a little more attractive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: \"We are now going to hear from Mr. Shessler of Ohio,\r\non his method of grafting, and I wish to assure you that he knows what\r\nhe is talking about. He has done a lot of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Walnuts in Ohio\r\n\r\nSYLVESTER SHESSLER, Genoa, Ohio\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1934 the Ohio Nut Growers Association conducted a black walnut nut\r\ncontest. I read about it in the _Ohio Farmer_. As soon as the names of\r\nthe winners appeared in that publication, each owner was contacted for\r\nsome nuts from the prize winning trees. Answers were received from nine\r\nof the 10 winners. I did not receive nuts from the Hoover tree. The\r\nBrown nuts I planted came up in 1935 and the trees are now 22 feet high,\r\nwith spread of 22 feet, and are 27 Inches in circumference. The Tritten\r\nprize nuts were planted in a fence row. These did not come up the first\r\nyear. The next year I plowed and disked the patch of ground and planted\r\npotatoes. To my surprise the Tritten seedlings came up with the\r\npotatoes. I let them grow and I now have five trees from these nuts. All\r\nof these trees produce nuts which resemble the original Tritten nut and\r\nhave good cracking quality. One in particular fills out nicely, has a\r\nvery thin hull, and is a little larger than the original Tritten. I have\r\nnamed it the Shessler. The Brown seedling trees also produce good nuts.\r\nThe seedling trees from the Cowle nuts produce nuts with rough shells.\r\n\r\nFollowing my nut planting project I began to collect scions from all of\r\nthe original trees. Mr. Homer Jacobs, of Kent, Ohio, supplied me with\r\nscions from the Tritten tree. The next year Mr. Jacobs asked me to send\r\nhim scions from the Brown tree as he intended to bench-graft some. I\r\nhave planted nuts along a road 80 rods long, so that I could have many\r\nstocks to top-work. I began to graft in 1935, using the seedling trees\r\nas stock. I now have 200 seedling black walnut trees, 100 grafted black\r\nwalnut trees, 25 grafted Persian walnuts, 20 chestnut trees, two\r\n\"buartnuts,\" 15 heartnuts, six pecans, one butternut, 20 grafted hickory\r\ntrees and five persimmons. Some of these trees are planted in orchard\r\nform, others are scattered along fence rows.\r\n\r\nFor grafting, I cut scions so that there is about four inches of\r\ntwo-year-old wood at the base and some one-year-old wood with small\r\nmatured buds. These small buds will grow, as a rule. The scions are kept\r\nin damp sawdust until used. I like the stock to be a half to one inch in\r\ndiameter. I wait until the trees are in full leaf before I graft. After\r\nleafing out the stock does not bleed. If I find that the stock is\r\nbleeding hard when I cut back, I wait a few days before grafting. It is\r\na waste of time to graft when the stock is bleeding. I have grafted very\r\nearly when the bark would not bleed at all. I just dug down into the\r\ncambium layer and put in the scion. I tried one Persian and three black\r\nwalnuts like this and all grew. I use the slot bark method of grafting,\r\nas described in Mr. Reed's bulletin [U.S.D.A. Farmers Bull. 1501]. The\r\nstock is cut straight across and I put the lower bud just above the\r\nbark on the outside. I roughen the bark of the scion that fits just\r\nbehind the bark of the stock. A small nail is pushed through the bark\r\nand scion with the handle of my knife. I generally tie with cord but\r\nsometimes when the bark is heavy I do not use cord. A two-pound paper\r\nsack with a hole on the earth side is placed over the graft and the sack\r\nis tied at the bottom. This serves as a \"hot house\" and protects the\r\nscion from rain. As soon as leaves appear on the scion, the sack is\r\nremoved and all the new sprouts are broken off below the graft. I put\r\nonly one scion on each graft. I use Beck's cold wax. It is easy to thin\r\nwith water and I just flatten a stick for my brush. I never wax the bud\r\nbut wax scion well on top.\r\n\r\nI cannot give an accurate count of my grafting success but estimate that\r\n75 percent of my grafts live. Rather than keep records I use that time\r\nto graft more trees. I am not an experimenter--I simply like to have\r\ngrafted nut trees. My own trees are scattered over a two-mile area. I\r\nhave grafted trees in Toledo and Grand Rapids. Every Sunday I attend\r\nchurch, then in the afternoon I graft trees. My aim is to try all the\r\npromising trees and select the best and weed out the poor ones. I am\r\nsaving only the trees that bear nuts every year.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, I grafted the Ohio 1946 prize winning black walnuts. I achieved\r\nsurvival on all except Nos. 5 and 8. The scionwood of these two was in\r\npoor condition and I did not think they would live. I also have No. 54\r\nwhich looks promising to me. I am looking forward to other contests in\r\nOhio and elsewhere so that we can uncover some more superior black\r\nwalnuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Shessler.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate, will you say a word to us on grafting? That's right along the\r\nsame line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting Walnuts in the Greenhouse\r\n\r\nGEORGE L. SLATE, State Experiment Station, Geneva, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts have been grafted in pots in the greenhouse at the Experiment\r\nStation at Geneva, N. Y. for a dozen years or more and the practice is\r\nsuccessful and very useful. This method was adopted for two reasons.\r\nFirst: Under field conditions results are often uncertain, owing to the\r\nvagaries of the weather or neglect at a critical time. The inexpertness\r\nof the operator made it desirable that the work be done under as\r\nfavorable conditions as possible, with the hope that a favorable\r\nenvironment might overcome in part the lack of skill. Second: The work\r\ncan be done in March before the field work begins, whereas field\r\ngrafting in May would often not get done owing to the pressure of other\r\nwork at that time. This method is not original with the writer, but is\r\nsimilar to the method used at the East Malling Research Station in\r\nEngland and described by Witt in 1928 [1].\r\n\r\nThe rootstocks, two year old black walnut seedlings raised from nuts\r\nplanted in the nursery, are dug in the fall, stored in the nursery\r\ncellar until late February or early March, at which time they are potted\r\nin six or eight inch pots, depending upon the size of the rootstocks.\r\nThe roots are cut back so that the plant will fit in the pot. At this\r\ntime the tops are cut off, leaving the stem about 8 inches high. The\r\npots are placed in a warm house, watered as needed, and in about 10 days\r\nthe buds begin to break.\r\n\r\nThe Jones modified cleft graft is used. The stub is cut off at grafting\r\ntime and the cleft is made by cutting, not splitting, the stock with a\r\nlarge grafting knife. The scion is tied in place with nursery tape,\r\nhalf-inch size, with a short wick leading out of the cleft. The scion is\r\npainted with grafting wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Care of the Grafted Plant+\r\n\r\nThe pot is set in a propagating frame about 18 inches deep, with bottom\r\nheat, and covered with glass, plus lath or cloth shade. An inch of peat\r\nin the bottom of the frame is desirable, to hold moisture and maintain\r\nhigh humidity. The temperature of the frame is kept in the eighties, but\r\nis not allowed to go above 90 deg.F. Under these conditions of warmth and\r\nhigh humidity, growth activity is rapid and in about two weeks the buds\r\nbreak, although, some may not start for a month. This spring\r\nadventitious buds developed on several scions. Many suckers arise from\r\nbelow the graft, and these are rubbed off two or three times a week. As\r\nsoon as the shoots from the scion are two or three inches long the\r\nplants may be removed to a cooler house, where there is less danger of\r\noverheating on hot spring days. Later, they go to the cold frame for\r\nhardening off, and when danger of frost is over after May 21st, they are\r\nset in the nursery for two years. First year growth is not over eight or\r\nten inches, but the second year the plants grow to three or four feet or\r\neven more in a favorable season.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of grafts starting depends largely on the scion wood.\r\nWood cut from vigorous young trees which is grafted the same day will\r\ngive a 90 percent stand or better, but wood from other sources varies\r\naccording, to the age and vigor of the tree from which it is cut and the\r\npercentage of success may be much less.\r\n\r\nThis method is useful for small scale operations where a greenhouse is\r\navailable and it is desirable to do the grafting before outside work\r\ninterferes with it. For one not skilled in nut tree grafting success is\r\nprobably more certain than with nursery grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Literature Cited+\r\n\r\n1 Witt, A. W. The vegetative propagation of walnuts. Ann.

It is certainly\r\nworth trying and would come at a pleasant time of the year, would be\r\neasy to do, and any of us could try it out.\r\n\r\nWe now should like to hear from Mr. Clarke on Nut Investigations at\r\nPennsylvania State College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Investigations at the Pennsylvania State College\r\n\r\nWILLIAM S. CLARKE, JR., State College, Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n\r\nOur present work in nut growing at the Pennsylvania State College was\r\nbegun in 1946. Some work had been started many years ago, and a small\r\nnumber of trees were planted, mostly black walnut; but a site was\r\nselected which proved to be very cold and frosty, and most of the trees\r\nsoon died. Further work had been planned at a later date, but the\r\ndepression and lack of labor and land prevented us from getting under\r\nway then.\r\n\r\nWhen the present project in nut growing was approved, the country was\r\njust beginning to recover from the recent war, and materials of most\r\nkinds, including nut trees, were very difficult to obtain. Therefore, in\r\norder to learn as much as possible about nut trees, we started at the\r\nbeginning, with the seed. About two bushels of hulled black walnuts were\r\ncollected from fence-row trees; some were planted out in the ground that\r\nautumn, and some were placed in soil in a box and kept over winter on\r\nthe outdoor porch of the packing house. Some hickory and pecan nuts were\r\nbought and also stored in a similar box. The only nuts which grew were\r\nthose planted out in the ground. They gave us a good germination, while\r\nnot a single nut stored in the boxes grew.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we have about 200 black walnut seedlings in the\r\nnursery. When they are a year or two older, they will be grafted to\r\nseveral of the named varieties of black walnuts, and those that take\r\nwill be planted out in a nut orchard. These seedling trees were\r\ntransplanted after one year's growth. About four or five times as much\r\nof the walnut plant was underground in the root as grew above ground\r\nwhere we could see it.\r\n\r\nSince the first year's work we have made a few purchases, and planted a\r\nfew more nut seeds. At the present time we have planted five pairs of\r\nnamed varieties of filberts, four Chinese chestnuts, of which three\r\nsurvive, four Persian walnuts, three of which survive, and two Japanese\r\nwalnuts. We also have a few seedlings of Turkish tree hazel obtained\r\nfrom nuts sent to us by one of our friends in the state of Washington\r\nand a few butternut seedlings grown from nuts of a tree on the college\r\ncampus.\r\n\r\nFuture plans include an orchard with many of the named varieties of\r\nblack walnuts and also, we hope, some of the new hardy strains and\r\nselections of the Persian walnut being introduced by the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. Representative specimens of a wide range of\r\nnut species will be collected. Some further work on chestnuts and\r\nfilberts may be attempted if they prove to be hardy here. Plans for the\r\nmore distant future include studies in soil fertilization and in\r\nspraying for disease and insect control.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cold Injury in 1947-48+\r\n\r\nThis past winter has been very hard on nut trees, and on some other\r\ntrees as well. In the first place, the cold weather of the autumn began\r\nvery suddenly after six weeks of uninterrupted warm weather without any\r\ncool nights to harden the wood. In late September a few days of cool\r\nweather came, and then three nights in five with temperatures near 20 deg..\r\nThe walnut foliage and some of the youngest wood turned black. Next came\r\na winter with extremely low temperatures, with the minima ranging from\r\n18 to 23 degrees below zero over our orchard land. Our four Persian\r\nwalnut trees were killed back to the ground; three of them have sprouted\r\nthis summer from the roots. Considerable leaf bud killing occurred on\r\nChinese chestnut. One Japanese walnut died back to the ground and has\r\nsprouted from the roots. The other tree lost most of its younger wood,\r\nbut some buds near the base of last season's growth have sprouted out to\r\nmake a new top. Several specimens of the golden chinkapin\r\n(_Castanopsis_) of the Pacific Coast, which had made one year's growth\r\nhere, were killed outright.\r\n\r\nMost of the terminal buds and youngest wood of our nursery trees of\r\nblack walnut were killed, but the trees have grown well this year from\r\nthe lateral buds. In the woods some black walnuts which had been cut\r\ndown about four or five years ago, and which had made sprout growth now\r\nabout fifteen feet high, were killed back from two to four feet by the\r\nwinter. A twenty-year-old Stabler black walnut on our lawn lost many of\r\nits top limbs, though the lower limbs survived the winter all right.\r\nSome other types of trees were also badly damaged: some locust trees\r\nwere killed to the ground, and many others were killed to very old wood.\r\nA ginkgo tree on our lawn was killed back to the main trunk. This was\r\none of the few times that I have ever seen injury on this species.\r\n\r\nOne of the five named varieties of filberts, Pal, escaped winter injury.\r\nDuChilly and Italian Red each have one good tree and one that was killed\r\nback to the ground, but is now sprouting from the roots. Of Medium Long,\r\nboth trees have been killed way back. One tree of Cosford was killed\r\ncompletely, and the other tree has been badly damaged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Clarke. Our family stopped on the way\r\nat a shelling plant where they were handling nuts by the ton, not the\r\nbushel, just the ton. I am not exaggerating. You have all heard the\r\nhill-billy program from Renfro Valley, no doubt, and we have with us\r\ntoday the man who is running that cracking plant and also this\r\nhill-billy chorus, Tom Mullins, who will tell us about what he is doing\r\ndown at Renfro Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack Walnuts: A New Specialty at Renfro Valley\r\n\r\nTOM MULLINS, Renfro Valley, Kentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: As Mr. Davidson said, I come from a little hill-billy\r\nsection up in Kentucky known as Renfro Valley. Up until about a year ago\r\nthe main commodity there was hill-billy music and a lot of noise on\r\nSaturday night. About last August our boss there kind of got interested\r\nin black walnuts. There were a lot of them going to waste all over the\r\ncounty due to the fact that most of our locals up there are kind of\r\nlazy. They don't like to get up there and stomp them out.\r\n\r\nHis original idea was to set up a hulling plant and hull the nuts and\r\nthen buy the walnuts from the locals after they were dried. One thing\r\nled to another, and we talked to Mr. McCauley there, and Dad bought a\r\nbig walnut plant to process black walnuts all the way through. He was\r\nnew to it and so was I. He said, \"Let's buy a million pounds of black\r\nwalnuts.\" I didn't any more know what a million pounds of black walnuts\r\nwas than I know how many grains of sand is in three or four buckets. It\r\ndidn't take me very long, I think it was 31 days, and I bought 1,030,000\r\npounds. That's a whole lot of walnuts in anybody's language.\r\n\r\nOne of the local boys on our radio program came up with the bright idea\r\nthat before in Renfro Valley we used to be just half nuts; now we are\r\nwalnuts.\r\n\r\nWe started cracking these things along about the 15th of October, and\r\nlast Saturday we cracked our last 10,000 pounds. Our machine is capable\r\nof cracking approximately 10,000 pounds in an 8-hour shift, and we carry\r\nthe walnut all the way through to remove any of the field litter that it\r\nmay have when it is picked up, and through cleaning air blasts and into\r\na cracking machine that does darn near all the work. The only thing we\r\nhaven't been able to figure out yet is how to get this machine to tell a\r\nbad kernel from a good one. We have to leave that to some of the girls\r\nwho do the work on the picking belts.\r\n\r\nOur future plan for this fall is to buy a million and a half pounds this\r\nyear and process them. I believe one of these gentlemen a while ago\r\nmentioned something about the pure food laws. They are pretty rough on\r\nus. We have to pasteurize our walnuts. The state law of Kentucky\r\nrequires 190 degrees of heat for an hour and a half. That's a lot of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWe package our nuts in two-ounce packages and in 35 and 50-pound cartons\r\nfor the wholesale trade.\r\n\r\nThat has created quite a little industry there in our county. We have\r\none county there, Clark County--Winchester, Kentucky, is the county seat\r\nof it--and out of that one county last year alone I bought 800,000\r\npounds of walnuts. That was, walnuts in the hull that the farmer had\r\npicked up and brought to us in trucks.\r\n\r\nOur success was not too great in this method of hulling green walnuts to\r\nget our supply. We weren't adequately fixed up to dry the walnuts and\r\ntake care of them in storage. We lost a few of them that way, but I\r\nthink this year we have a little better sense and will let the farmer\r\nstomp them out.\r\n\r\nWe are working now on an educational program, both newspaper and radio,\r\nto persuade the farmers in our locality to let their walnut trees grow.\r\nWe tell them nearly all the walnut trees will produce enough kernels or\r\nshelled walnuts to bring in as much money as they would if cut down and\r\ntaken to the mill and used for saw logs. That is our main problem now,\r\nto try to keep the black walnut industry working there in our community.\r\nAnd our future plans call for plantings of black walnut seedlings and\r\nconvincing the farmer and the 4-H Club members and all the boys in the\r\nFuture Farmers of America and organizations like that to protect and\r\ncultivate their black walnut trees.\r\n\r\nI am kind of on the fence this year. I stuck my neck away out the other\r\nday and bought a farm. After checking the farm I found I had about 600\r\nwalnut trees. Now, then, I am hollering on one hand for an increase in\r\nprices of raw material, and as a sheller I am hollering on the other\r\nhand to get the prices down. But I believe as a producer for next year I\r\nam going to try to forget about the shelling and let the prices go to\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Would you mind telling us what you had to pay for the\r\nwalnuts in the shell?\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: Our average last year was $4.33. We went as high as $4.80.\r\nSome of those we bought hurriedly--\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: In the hull?\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: No, that's dry shell. Our walnuts in the hull we paid a\r\ndollar and a quarter a hundred for, and if we had had good success we'd\r\nhave made some money on it at that angle.\r\n\r\nThere is one question I'd like to put before you gentlemen. Maybe some\r\nof you know a little something about it. I was reading an article not\r\nlong ago in Popular Mechanics Magazine about some plant on the West\r\nCoast that is developing the Vitamin C content of the walnut hull\r\nitself. It is very high, the Vitamin C content in the walnut hull.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we did last year. After we hulled all of these walnuts we\r\nhad a mess of hulls on hand, and our farmers were a little reluctant to\r\ncome and get them. We tried to talk them into using them for fertilizer.\r\nThey are kind of like some of the boys, they have got to be shown. They\r\nhave to see somebody else do it before they tackle it.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity I laid my garden off and divided it in half, and on one\r\nhalf I put a top dressing of these dried-out, pulverized walnut hulls,\r\nand I firmly believe that the side that had the walnut hulls on it\r\nproduced twice as much. And some of the boys in the neighborhood kind of\r\nnoticed what kind of garden I had, and we don't have any hull problem\r\nanymore. They carried them all off.\r\n\r\nSame way with the shells. We tried to get them to haul the shells off to\r\nuse them on the fields for tobacco land and to grow blue grass, and they\r\nfound out that was pretty good, so they are bothering us now about our\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nWe have another by-product. It is too small a granule kernel to go\r\nthrough, and we can't remove the shell from it. We have tried that out\r\non chickens and hogs and some other farm animals, turkeys, ducks and\r\ngeese. One boy that works for me there in the cracking plant had 28\r\nhens. He had them in a pen, and he was getting six and eight eggs a day.\r\nSo I talked him into taking some of these granules home and feeding them\r\nto his chickens, and in two weeks his 28 hens were producing 20 to 24\r\neggs a day. That kind of settled that problem, too. Some of the boys\r\nkind of got an idea they'd like to have some of that.\r\n\r\nA lot of you folks are here from the North, and you possibly would be\r\ngoing back along Highway 25 going home, and I'd like to extend an\r\ninvitation now to stop off tomorrow or the next day and look over our\r\nplant. It's quite interesting, quite a complicated piece of machinery.\r\nMr. McCauley at Chicago is the gentleman who designed the machine, and\r\nhe will have something to say about it.\r\n\r\nOne of the local farmers came in to see that machine one day, and it was\r\noperating, just batting the kernels out right and left. He looked up at\r\nit, gandered it all over, and I asked him what he thought it was. He\r\nsaid, \"It's a damn lie. That thing can't do it.\"\r\n\r\nSo come see us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Next, Marketing Black Walnut\r\nKernels. This fits in with what Mr. Mullins has said. Mr. McCauley from\r\nChicago will tell us about it. Mr. McCauley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing Black Walnut Kernels\r\n\r\nF. J. McCAULEY, McCauley Company, Chicago, Illinois\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Tom has got me on the spot here. I\r\ncame here to speak to you about the marketing of black walnuts.\r\nMachinery is a hobby of mine, and that thing there was just one of those\r\noff-shoots of an infertile brain. But Tom is having a lot of trouble,\r\nand a lot of fun with it, so if you people would like to see that\r\nmachine, that particular machine, I am glad that he invited you up\r\nthere. It may give you a little different idea of what the sheller is up\r\nagainst in the salvaging of black walnut kernels.\r\n\r\nYou are interested in growing the black walnuts and other nuts in the\r\nshell, but they do have to be prepared for the public, and Tom's job,\r\nand other people's that are in the shelling business, is getting them\r\nout. The machines are made at Knoxville, Tennessee, and you can get a\r\nfairly decent idea about the shelling of black walnuts from the machine\r\nSmalley has. Tom's is a much larger size.\r\n\r\nNow we will get down to this thing I came here to talk to you about, the\r\nmarketing of black walnuts. My speech is divided into three parts; the\r\nfirst is about nuts, the second is about nuts and the third is about\r\nnuts, and I am nuts. Yes, that's more true than you think. My nickname\r\nthroughout the United States is \"Nuts\" McCauley, and I am proud of it.\r\nIt is a good nickname to have for a man that's in the nut business. And\r\nI most certainly am in the nut business, machinery on one hand and the\r\nselling of various types of nut kernels on the other.\r\n\r\nYou people probably don't know it, but you have the best advertised nut\r\nin the United States that you are working with, black walnuts. There are\r\nvery few people in the United States that don't know what a black walnut\r\nkernel is, or a black walnut. In fact, I would say that 75 per cent of\r\nthem at some time or other have gathered black walnuts, have hulled\r\nthem. You know those pretty stained hands you have, and I can remember\r\nback in those days when I was a kid when I used to get those hands of\r\nmine just so brown and black from the hulling of black walnuts that my\r\nmother would almost want to turn me over her knee and spank me. But when\r\nwintertime came I always had a bunch of black walnuts that we could sit\r\ndown and crack and put in those cookies or in that fudge.\r\n\r\nI have talked to a good many of you people here, and I have a prepared\r\nspeech, but I am going to ramble a little bit and I am going to ask you\r\nto ask me questions, because I found out that I don't know so many\r\nthings, or the speech that I was going to make to you might not be as\r\ninteresting as your asking me questions. I do want to say a few things,\r\nand I will go through quickly.\r\n\r\nThe first is the marketing of black walnuts in the shell. We find in the\r\nmarketing of any product that there is a tremendous amount of waste due\r\nto poor sacking, due to a little dishonesty on the part of the people\r\nwho are selling merchandise. You know, if there is a brick in a bag, the\r\nbrick weighs a pound, that costs the man who buys the black walnuts\r\nmoney. In other words, out of that pound of brick he intended to get a\r\nsmall quantity of meats to sell, so his cost immediately goes up. You'd\r\nbe surprised at how many bricks and how much iron there is in black\r\nwalnuts and pecans! It's universal throughout the United States. There\r\nis a lot of chiseling that goes on. Your bags should be good. Black\r\nwalnuts must be held for some time before they are processed, and one\r\nblack walnut bag used one year can't be used another. If you can get by\r\nwith one year's use of a bag to hold a hundred pounds, or whatever is\r\nput in it, of black walnuts, you are very fortunate. Usually they break\r\nout before the year is over, and that causes waste. So start out with a\r\ndecent bag.\r\n\r\nI made a little note here to talk to you about California black walnuts.\r\nThe standard throughout the United States to people who actually buy\r\nblack walnut kernels is what we call in the brokerage field Eastern\r\nblack walnuts. That means Kentucky and Tennessee. Those are Eastern\r\nblacks, they are the blacks with the flavor, the blacks that stand up.\r\nFrom my home state they have Missouri blacks, but the quality isn't\r\nthere. The flavor doesn't hold up. But you people down here grow the\r\nfinest blacks in the world. California, yes, California grows and shells\r\na lot of black walnuts, but they don't have a black walnut flavor. The\r\nflavor is gone. Where it went, I don't know. But there isn't any black\r\nwalnut flavor in California blacks. [A different species, _Juglans\r\nhindsi_--Ed.]\r\n\r\nSo some unscrupulous people buy California blacks and mix them with\r\nEastern black walnuts. Then they can't call them Eastern blacks. They\r\nare just black walnut kernels. But black walnut kernels that are 100 per\r\ncent Eastern black walnut kernels should be the standard of black\r\nwalnuts through the country.\r\n\r\nNow, Tom has told you something about the process of shelling. I am just\r\ngoing on to say that the average sheller gets about 10 to 11.7 pounds of\r\nblack walnut kernels to the hundred pounds. So you can realize there\r\nagain what a problem he has.\r\n\r\nWell, the marketing of black walnuts is the selling of black walnuts in\r\nthe shell or shelled. We have very little demand in the Chicago markets\r\nfor in-the-shell black walnuts. I probably sell, oh, maybe 5,000 pounds\r\na year on South Water Market, and they go out to the various stores, and\r\nthey, in turn, sell them to the homes that like to crack black walnuts\r\ninstead of buying the kernels.\r\n\r\nThe American public buy with their eyes. Consequently, the packaging of\r\nblack walnut kernels or the packaging of any merchandise is very\r\nimportant. I made a statement this morning that has always been\r\ninteresting to me. You know, Chicago is the biggest candy center in the\r\nworld, and we do a lot of experimenting with candy. Now, your industry\r\nis tied very closely to candy, because a lot of the black walnuts,\r\nhickory nuts, and the like, go into the making of candy. But to prove my\r\npoint, a number of times friends of mine who are interested in the sale\r\nof merchandise have taken quality candy and packed it in a common box,\r\nand they have taken an inferior quality of candy and packed it in a\r\nfancy box and set it on the floor and put the same price on both\r\nproducts. The American public, remember, buys with their eyes. So they\r\nbuy something that is well dressed and they buy that inferior product,\r\ntwice or three times as fast as they would that quality product in the\r\ncommon box.\r\n\r\nI am bringing this out to illustrate a point. _Well packaged\r\nmerchandise, sightly merchandise, always pays._ Quality to you people\r\nwho actually crack black walnuts in your homes is something that will\r\npay dividends. Separate your big kernels. Offer them to the public and\r\nthey will pay for them.\r\n\r\nI was talking to Dr. Jones of Pennsylvania about the sale of black\r\nwalnut halves. He says that he gets a good many of them. Well, there\r\nare throughout these United States of ours a good many very fancy\r\nstores that will buy merchandise of this type. But the quantity that\r\nanyone gets is very small, so the suggestion that I made to Dr. Jones is\r\nthat he take his quarters and mix them with his halves. That's not\r\ncheating or anything like it. It is making a product that is superior.\r\nAnd you know they say if a man makes a better mousetrap the world will\r\ncome to his door. And that is generally true. Sometimes it takes a long\r\ntime to bring it to the American public or to your buyers, to make them\r\nrealize that you have a superior product, but that's the thing that it\r\ntakes.\r\n\r\nNow, there are a number of ways they sell blacks in this country. They\r\nsell them in two-ounce cellophane bags, they sell them in six-ounce\r\ncellophane, they sell them in eight-ounce cellophane, but the greater\r\nquantity of the blacks are sold in bulk, as Tom told you, in 35- and\r\n50-pound cases, and they go to the candy manufacturer, they go to the\r\nice cream manufacturer, and chiefly throughout the southern part of the\r\nUnited States for ice cream, believe it or not. The Southern States buy\r\nmore black walnut ice cream than any other division of the United\r\nStates. In the Central West, too, black walnuts are quite popular for\r\nuse in ice cream.\r\n\r\nNow, if there is anyone that has any questions, I'd like for you to ask\r\nthem, and I will try to answer them, I won't promise that I can, about\r\nthe marketing of black walnuts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Member: What's the retail sale on those cellophane bags?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: What would be the retail sale price?\r\n\r\nA Member: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Well, the cellophaning of walnuts is quite an expensive\r\nproposition. We will say right now the kernels are worth 70 cents a\r\npound. The cellophaner has to add a dime a pound to that price, so he\r\nfigures his cost at 80 cents and the cost of cellophane, and he sells\r\nthat merchandise so that he makes a 15 per cent profit. Let me see if I\r\ncan tell you, a two-ounce bag--\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: It sells for from 18 cents to 25 cents.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Yes, 18 cents in the chain stores. An 8-ounce package at A\r\n& P in Chicago will sell for 59 or 69 cents. I have forgotten now just\r\nwhat it is. I can't keep these prices in my mind, although I will tell\r\nyou this now. If any of you ever come to Chicago, I have an experimental\r\nplant in Chicago. If you could remember McCauley, it's \"McCauley\r\nCompany,\" or \"McCauley Machinery Company,\" and in that plant I also have\r\na new machine for bagging nuts, cellophane bagging. It makes the bag,\r\nfills it and seals it in one operation, and we have operated that\r\nmachine at the rate of 100 bags per minute, 2-ounce or 6-ounce, it\r\ndoesn't make any difference. The only trouble is the people couldn't\r\nhandle the bags that fast, so we had to cut it down to 58 a minute. It's\r\nquite an operation, and at this time it is an experimental operation.\r\nBut I would be more than pleased to have any of you drop in on me in\r\nChicago. If I am not there someone in my organization will be glad to\r\nshow you, if you tell them what you came for.\r\n\r\nI have a \"California\" walnut, or Persian, as you call it. I was much\r\nsurprised to see all these samples of walnuts down here. I have a walnut\r\nshelling plant in Chicago, I do at this time. Maybe when you get there\r\nit will be a pecan shelling plant, or maybe it will be a _Macadamia_ nut\r\nplant. How many of you people have ever heard of _Macadamia_ nuts?\r\n(Several hands raised.) More than I thought for. Well, we are working on\r\na plant to shell _Macadamias_ now. Of course, that is a tropical nut,\r\ngrown chiefly in Hawaii and Australia. The Australian nut is not nearly\r\nas good as the Hawaiian nut. But to those of you who are not familiar\r\nwith the nut, I have given it to any number of people and asked for\r\ntheir reaction, and some said it tasted like a filbert, others said it\r\ntasted like cocoanut, and the third one named was Brazil nut. So it's a\r\nvery pleasant nut to eat, but very, very expensive.\r\n\r\nDr. Moss: I live in Williamsburg in Whitley County not far from you, and\r\nwe have no market there for black walnuts at all and got quite a lot of\r\nthem there. I wonder if it would be practical to have a collection\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: It certainly would. In the southeastern part of Texas we\r\nhave one.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: A question, Mr. McCauley. You said that you are able to\r\nrecover about 11 per cent in the cracking plant on the average, I think\r\nyou said 10 to 11.7 for ordinary run quality. Now, if you had walnuts\r\nthat would run 25 to 28 per cent kernel, how much would your processing\r\nplants recover out of that, I am just-wondering?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Well, I would like to say two per cent less than the\r\nhand-cracked weight. In other words, if you had a total, hand-cracking\r\ntotal kernel content of 25 per cent, I would like to say 23, but I think\r\nthat is just a little bit strong. In Tom's early processing of black\r\nwalnut kernels at Renfro Valley his first average was 16 per cent on\r\nwild nuts. I don't know where he got those nuts. They must have been\r\nThomas variety. But as he told me today, he is down to 10.7.\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: Those nuts I talked about, Mac, that ran up that high\r\npercentage were from over in Clark County around Winchester. And I have\r\nquite a few of them that I pick-up that are even larger in size than\r\nsome of these Thomas nuts that are lying in here, out of that particular\r\nlocality. They are very big.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: You will find that that is true. Your percentage varies\r\nover the country. I like to think that the wild seedling black walnut\r\nhas a possibility of about 18 pounds in a hundred. I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Is that loss in the cracking procedure; I mean, that the\r\nthings don't crack out?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley:. The loss is in the cracking, but on an 18 pounds\r\npossibility we would probably get between 14 and 15 per cent with this\r\nnew method of cracking and processing.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Now, if you had a nut that would run hand-cracked 24 per\r\ncent, you lose 2 in your cracking procedure, and you recover 22. Would\r\nyou pay twice as much for nuts of that quality as you would for common\r\ngrade?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Yes, I think that I would. If I had assurance that I was\r\ngoing to get 22 per cent kernels I would be very pleased to pay double.\r\nIt would pay me, if I were shelling, to pay twice as much for that\r\nvariety for the simple reason that I only have one cost of picking. Now,\r\nthe average cost of picking black walnuts kernels is about 11-1/2 cents\r\na pound. At least, that's the best I have ever been able to do with\r\nthem. And if you sold me a walnut that would give me twice as many\r\nkernels with one cracking and one picking, I'd make money and I could\r\npay you twice as much money for that nut.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: What volume would a cracker have to have to make it\r\ninteresting? What quantity would have to be produced and offered to a\r\ncracker to make it interesting? That is, say I have 50 bushels of\r\nThomas. That isn't any good to you, because your cracking plant--\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Why wouldn't it? If I had 50 bushels, that is 2500 pounds,\r\nright? All right, Tom could run his plant for two hours and a half, we\r\nwill say, on 2500 pounds, and in that two hours and a half he would be\r\ngetting as much kernels as he would otherwise in five hours. That's good\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I'd just like to comment on that 18 per cent kernel you\r\nmentioned as the average you'd like to think of. Mr. Zarger has run a\r\nstudy on the sample trees in the Tennessee Valley to measure the kernel\r\ncontent in some 130 trees for about seven years running, and it pans out\r\nto about 18 per cent. I thought you'd just like to know.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: I didn't want to make a definite statement and then have\r\nsomebody throw something back in my face. That's why I said I'd like to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher: Since this question has come up and a cracker is here, and\r\nthat is the question, whether the commercial cracker would be willing to\r\npay a premium price for premium nuts, I wonder if Tom will answer the\r\nquestion, would he pay twice as much?\r\n\r\nMr. Mullins: Certainly.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Mr. Acker is another sheller who operates in Morristown,\r\nTennessee, and Broadway, Virginia, who just dropped in on us. I'd like\r\nto ask him that same question.\r\n\r\nMr. Acker: What is the question again?\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: Would a considerable quantity of walnuts such as Thomas be\r\nworth more to you?\r\n\r\nMr. Acker: We'd be inclined to buy them according to the value we get\r\nout of them.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: What would you do, run sort of a pilot test on them?\r\n\r\nMr. Acker: If I can buy something for a dollar and make money on it, I\r\nam willing to try.\r\n\r\nMr. Chase: I made a little unscheduled talk last night in which I said\r\nfrom my information from shellers in Nashville, particularly, that they\r\nat this time would not be able to pay any premium price for higher\r\nquality nuts simply because they do not have time to examine each\r\nbushel, each hundred pounds that comes in and see whether they would pay\r\na special price for better walnuts. Is that the general situation?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: Yes, I think generally that is. They take everything at\r\nthe price of seedling variety. However, you gentlemen who are growing\r\ncultivated nuts shouldn't be too disturbed, because of the fact that\r\nthere is going to be a time in the not-too-distant future where you can\r\ndispose of those nuts according to the kernel content within the nut.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I think that's the answer. Eventually it will come.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: It's good business. Stop and consider. We go right back to\r\nthat point where we are going to get twice the amount of merchandise out\r\nof a hull which must be broken, which must be picked, which must be\r\ncleaned, which is one operation. In a two and a half hour period, which\r\nis what it would take, we will say, to run 2500 pounds, you would get\r\nthe net content on a Thomas variety that you would ordinarily receive in\r\nfive hours of actual operation. You are saving two and a half hours\r\nlabor, you are saving two and a half hours machine time, and you are\r\ngetting just twice as much.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: You'd have twice as many girls on the sorting belt,\r\nwouldn't you, to examine that volume?\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: No, not necessarily. When it gets to that point it isn't\r\nnecessary. Sometimes the machine gets too far ahead of them, but the\r\nmachinery is fast getting to a point where it is going to be more or\r\nless mechanical. It's an inspection proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor: May I ask you this question? In other branches of farming\r\nyou have what you call seed certification, as with certified potatoes,\r\nand people who certify those potatoes. Wouldn't it be possible for the\r\nsame Government agency to certify growers of walnuts so that when you\r\nbought from certain members of this association they would be certified\r\nso you would know what you were getting? Would that be possible?\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Certification has to do with planting stock.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor: I mean a different type of certification.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: What you have in mind probably is U. S. Grades on fruit.\r\nFor instance, if it is stamped \"U.S. 1\" it should be considerably better\r\nthan orchard run, and I don't know why it shouldn't be possible for nuts\r\nin the shell. It is used in California.\r\n\r\nMr. McCauley: It is in peanuts. All peanuts are Government graded, and\r\nthat's in the shell. But this black walnut situation is going to take a\r\nlittle longer than that. But I am sure that there are people in the\r\nshelling business who would buy Thomas variety or the other varieties if\r\nyou just go ahead and tell them that's what you have. People are always\r\nlooking for something better, and I am sure that your cultivated\r\nvarieties are going to be better, but you are going to have to keep\r\ntalking them up all the time and getting them to the people who will buy\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Right. We'd all like to go on with this, but we must\r\nreally go on with the program, too. We will next hear something about\r\npasteurization. The Production of Bacteria-Free Walnut Kernels will be\r\ndiscussed by Mr. Pease of West Virginia University. Mr. Pease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduction of Bacteria-Free Walnut Kernels\r\n\r\nROGER W. PEASE, Assistant Hillculturist, West Virginia University,\r\nMorgantown, West Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: Before I go into any detail about the construction of the\r\npasteurizer, I am going to review the bacillus that causes the trouble\r\nvery briefly. Most of you will know more about it than I do, but some of\r\nyou may know less.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmer takes the hulls from the black walnuts he generally\r\nspreads his hulled crop to dry almost anywhere. Rats will go over them,\r\nand these rats or mice infect the hulled walnuts with an organism called\r\n_Bacillus coli_ that is on the outside of the shell. They go from there\r\nto the cracking plant, go through the cracker which thoroughly mixes up\r\nthe infected nuts with the clean ones. They go from there to the\r\nseparator, which does a better job at spreading the bacteria. Then they\r\ngo on the market. If they are shipped from one state to another they are\r\nsubject to inspection by Federal authorities. If they find this\r\norganism in the kernels, they may at their discretion heave the whole\r\nshipment into the river. They don't always do it. They haven't worked\r\nout yet a definite scheme to follow. In other words, they will not tell\r\nus, \"If your kernels have a certain number of these _B. coli_ in them we\r\nwill let them by.\" As it reads, there should be not one organism there,\r\nand I can assure you that's almost impossible to get if a rat has\r\ncrawled over those things.\r\n\r\nNow, to get rid of poison ivy the best way is not to get it, and it's\r\njust the same with this organism. The place to get rid of it would be\r\nfor the farmer to store the nuts to dry where the rats and mice cannot\r\nget to them and for the cracking plants to do the same. Unfortunately,\r\nthis isn't done and sometimes isn't practicable. The next place to hit\r\nthem would be before they are tumbled, that is, before the black powder\r\non the outside of the shells is shaken off in a tumbler, or immediately\r\nafter that to disinfect the shell without hurting the kernel.\r\n\r\nThat is where we should have started at West Virginia, but we didn't. We\r\nbegan at the other end after the thing was through and began studying\r\npasteurization. The Government had recommended, I believe, temperatures\r\nof up to 300 deg.F. for pasteurization. We found out right away--that is, I\r\ndidn't, Dr. Colmer and Harvey Erickson, who are now--one of them--in\r\nBaton Rouge and the other one in Seattle, and they would know about it.\r\nThey found out that after temperatures of over 300 deg. the nuts tasted\r\ntoasted and they would not keep nearly so well or so long as an\r\nunpasteurized nut.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting what pasteurizers they could get access to they\r\nconcluded some work was necessary, so they spent 12 months and found\r\nthat at a temperature of 160 and humidity of 80 per cent a more\r\nefficient job of pasteurization was done, and at the same time the\r\nkernel was not hurt at all. The taste was identical with an\r\nunpasteurized nut, and it would keep just as long. At that point one of\r\nthem, as I say, went to Louisiana and the other went to Washington, and\r\nthe research fell on my shoulders, that didn't know much about it.\r\n\r\nWe started to construct the machine. Meanwhile, Mr. Erickson told me he\r\nhad developed a new strain of bacteria which was much more hardy and 160\r\ndegrees at 80% humidity would not kill the thing. So we constructed our\r\nmachine to run a temperature of 180 at 70% humidity for 30 minutes, and\r\nthat will kill them.\r\n\r\nNow, in 15 minutes I can't give you anywhere near all the details of\r\nconstruction of that machine. I can give you a few of the principles. On\r\nthe outside, of course, is a well insulated box. The nuts are fed\r\nthrough the top with a revolving drum with fins on it. They comes down\r\nto a belt that travels this way for six feet, drops to another, travels\r\nback, a series of five belts. It takes them just half an hour to go\r\nthrough. The layer of nuts is perhaps three-eighths of an inch thick.\r\nThe temperature is kept up with electric coils. It is regulated with a\r\nthermostat.\r\n\r\nWe had some difficulty with the humidity. Try it and see. As we raised\r\nour temperature it was hard to keep our humidity up. Finally we went\r\nback to the simplest thing, which usually works. We just took a pan of\r\nwater, with a solenoid valve and float such as you have in the modern\r\nhot air furnaces and put a magnetic switch on it. As the water boiled it\r\nhelped raise the temperature, and it gave off vapors. The automatic\r\nswitch and the wet and dry bulb from the thermometer and thermostat will\r\nshut the water off and shut the heat off automatically when you get the\r\nrequired temperature and the required humidity. In that machine our\r\nnuts start at the top, take 30 minutes to travel through. From the time\r\nthey start at the top until the time they get to the bottom they have a\r\nstandard temperature of 180 deg. plus the 70% humidity.\r\n\r\nThen the second problem, if you want to make one, is to get that\r\ntemperature standard in all places. I know one man who made one of these\r\nmachines and put four fans in at different places, and when he closed it\r\nup and got it to working, the center of his machine was still cold,\r\nbecause your hot air acts differently from free air. We put at the\r\nbottom a shelf with a tube in it and a big fan in the middle. The air is\r\ndrawn down from the top here, driven through there, hits some baffles\r\nand comes across each belt. In that way it works.\r\n\r\nNow, if you want, any of you, to get the details of the pasteurizer you\r\ncould write to Mr. Erickson, College of Forestry, University of\r\nWashington, Seattle 5, and he who designed it would be very glad, I\r\nbelieve, to help with your problems, or you could write up to our\r\nAgricultural Engineering department, and they would do the same.\r\n\r\nI will tell you this, that after we drew up the plans, I took the plans\r\nto several manufacturers, and the cheapest bid I got was $5,000 to make\r\nit. We made it ourselves for a little less than $1,200 not counting\r\nlabor. Not that they would have made that much profit, but I tell you\r\nthat to show you it's a rather inexpensive machine. On the other hand,\r\nyou can save considerable money by getting it made up yourselves.\r\n\r\nI am going to stop with the thing there. If there are a few questions\r\nthat you wish to ask, I will try to answer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Member: What is the name of the bacteria you are killing?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: _Bacillus coli_, that's the chief bacteria, and the others\r\nthat cause the damage are similar to that, and they are always spread by\r\nthe rats or the mice.\r\n\r\nA Member: Do the kernels properly pasteurized show any brownness of\r\nkernel?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: No, they are identical with an unpasteurized kernel at that\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nMr. Korn: I buy kernels at the plant in Nashville, and some of them have\r\nbeen toasted.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: They have 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. Kays: You mentioned you should have started on the other end a while\r\nago. Could you treat those nuts before they are cracked and do the same\r\nthing for less money?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: I believe you could.\r\n\r\nMr. Kays: The other question I have is how about using ultra-violet\r\nlight?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: I have written to a good many authorities, and some of them\r\nsay yes and some say no.\r\n\r\nMr. Kays: In pecans that is one of the practices.\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: I believe you could use it in our present machine.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Isn't this heat to remove contamination? After the nuts are\r\ncracked is there any examination of the nuts?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: No, there is not.\r\n\r\nMr. Stoke: Could there be any possible value in sterilizing the nut\r\nbefore it is cracked?\r\n\r\nMr. Pease: Yes. You see, the bacteria is on the shell, on the outside.\r\nThen when you crack it, it gets on the nut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you very much, Mr. Pease. I do hate to cut\r\nthese discussions short. You get as much out of them or more, sometimes,\r\nthan we do otherwise. There is just one thing I'd like to say before we\r\ntake a five-minute recess. Mr. Acker is here. He is another man that you\r\nmight talk to in addition to talking to Mr. Mullins during the recess.\r\n\r\n(Recess taken.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The meeting will come to order. The first thing on\r\nthe program is a talk by Dr. Cross, Head of the Department of\r\nHorticulture, Oklahoma A. & M., Stillwater, Oklahoma, on Pecan Selection\r\nin Oklahoma. Dr. Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan Selection in Oklahoma\r\n\r\nDR. FRANK B. CROSS, Head, Department of Horticulture, Oklahoma A & M\r\nCollege, Stillwater, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Cross: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: The present status of the\r\npecan industry in Oklahoma is the result of close cooperation between\r\nthe growers and the experiment station combined with a resource which we\r\nhave in that state consisting of thousands of native pecan trees which\r\nmay be quickly and economically changed into producing trees instead of\r\njust wild forest trees.\r\n\r\nI am going to utilize my time this afternoon to discuss, first, briefly\r\nthe present situation as we find it with reference to pecans in\r\nOklahoma, because there is the important phase of nut growing which we\r\nfollow in that state. We do grow some walnuts and we have a great many\r\nmen interested in walnuts, but far and away our major interest is in\r\npecans.\r\n\r\nWe might divide the work and interest in the state into two phases.\r\nFirst, but of least importance, is that connected with the planting and\r\nproduction of varieties. We have a great many men in the state who wish\r\nto plant land to pecans, and, of course, in cases like that the\r\nvarieties which are available are always selected for planting, and\r\nnursery trees, of course, are utilized. The latest phase of that type of\r\ndevelopment is the planting of apple trees for filler trees with the\r\nexpectation that the apple trees will be removed after 15 or 20 years,\r\nthus leaving the pecan trees at a large size to fully occupy the ground,\r\nand in the meantime the apple trees, of course, have produced a\r\nprofitable crop.\r\n\r\nOur growers, however, and the industry in the state are far more\r\nconcerned with the utilization of the native trees. To talk about these\r\nnative trees is almost--well, we might borrow a Texas expression--these\r\ntrees grow both in Oklahoma and Texas--and the Texans say whenever a\r\nTexan tries to tell the truth everybody knows he is lying. That's the\r\nway everybody knows about some of these native trees. When we think of a\r\nhuge, tall tree 20 or so feet in circumference over a hundred years of\r\nage and realize that the white man has occupied that particular\r\nterritory for only a little over 50 years, we wonder about the history\r\nof that tree for the first 50 years of its life when wild Indians were\r\nroaming the territory and buffalo were grazing under these trees which\r\nwere getting started.\r\n\r\nThese trees occur along the streams, very seldom out away from the\r\nstreams for any considerable distance, as one of the native forest trees\r\nand in sufficient number so that when all other trees are removed the\r\nstand of pecan trees remaining is in many cases more than adequate to\r\nmake a complete stand of pecans for commercial production. So that after\r\nhaving removed the oaks and elms and cottonwoods and willows and the\r\nother native trees, we have the opportunity of making a considerable\r\nselection of desirable native or seedling trees by observing the type of\r\nnut which each tree produces.\r\n\r\nWe are not, in making this selection, concerned so much with the size of\r\nthe nut produced as we are with the kernel percentage which will be\r\nyielded by the nut upon cracking and extracting the kernels and by the\r\nease of separation. Within comparatively recent years many cracking and\r\nshelling plants have been established throughout the state, and the\r\nhistory of the industry I think will record that the establishment of\r\nthese cracking plants in the territory where the pecans are produced\r\nwill be a great stimulus to the production of that kind of nuts.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I have made the picture clear or not. Throughout\r\nthe eastern part of the state, that part which you in your old\r\ngeographies knew under the name of Indian Territory, and particularly\r\nconcentrated in the middle of the state there are native trees which if\r\nproperly handled, that is, cultivated and sprayed and thinned so that\r\neach tree stands out individually by itself, will produce in paying\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nOn the experiment station we have a half mile of such territory lying\r\nbetween cultivated fields on both sides of a creek which had eroded a\r\nconsiderable basin. The area was unsatisfactory for cultivation, and so\r\nit was fenced out. Back some years ago the area was cleared of grape\r\nvines and other trees, and we have since that time pastured sheep in\r\nthis tract of land. It Is narrow, not over three or four hundred feet\r\nwide at any place and, of course, varying in width from one end to the\r\nother, and the creek meanders along. There really is more than a half\r\nmile of total length.\r\n\r\nThe potential production of that half mile is now, in terms of dollars\r\nand cents, about $2,500 to $3,000, and before wheat and cattle attained\r\ntheir present prices that was no mean income for a quarter section of\r\nland. Naturally, with that opportunity prevalent over a great part of\r\nthe state, we in Oklahoma are interested in the production of native or\r\nseedling pecans to be sold to the cracker. We feel that the future of\r\nthe pecan industry is undoubtedly headed toward the utilization of\r\npecans as kernels and not nuts in the shell. Such being the case, we are\r\nnot interested particularly in large size. We are interested in kernel\r\nyield and in the potential production of each individual tree.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many problems connected with the industry, and we have\r\nmore or less taken those into consideration and classified them under\r\ninsects and diseases and marketing and harvesting and varieties. I will\r\nnot have time to touch upon very many of these. Our harvesting situation\r\nis completely chaotic. Within the last two ot three years shaking\r\nmachines have been developed, and we are indebted to the West Coast\r\ngrowers for these inventions, which are very helpful. Previous to that\r\na, long bamboo pole was used to knock the pecans from the trees, and\r\nthen they were picked up off the ground. There are two machines now\r\nwaiting for the present crop to be harvested which are supposed to pick\r\nup the nuts by vacuum picking.\r\n\r\nIf the industry can be mechanized in that manner, getting away from\r\nharvesting pecans as we have been harvesting them, it is just like\r\ncradling wheat as compared to the present-day 12-foot, self-propelled\r\ncombine that cuts the wheat so rapidly. If this mechanization can be put\r\ninto effect, then the native seedling territory in Texas and Oklahoma\r\nwill be able to produce pecans at a price which the market will accept.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether you know it or not, but the pecan market situation\r\nhas apparently reached a condition of saturation. It was very difficult\r\nto sell pecans last fall, not because there is over-production, no, but\r\nbecause there is under-consumption.\r\n\r\nThere are two things which will remedy the situation. The pecan is\r\nunquestionably the finest nut that is produced in the United States. If\r\nthe people of the North can be acquainted with the pecan, there is no\r\nquestion in my mind but that it will be possible to vastly increase\r\nconsumption. The Oklahoma growers and buyers hope to put before the\r\nlegislature a proposition to assess a tax of a quarter of a cent or\r\nsomething like that per pound, which will be used in an advertising\r\ncampaign to advertise pecans outside of the state, so maybe you folks in\r\nNew York and elsewhere, if the campaign is successful, will hear more\r\nabout Oklahoma pecans in the future.\r\n\r\nWell, these seedling trees--I must get on with my story--are cultivated\r\nand sprayed. We are sometimes accused of producing wild nuts at no cost.\r\nThis is not the situation distinctly. It costs just as much to produce\r\nthese native seedling nuts as it does to produce the varieties, the\r\nadvantage being that we start with a large tree which is capable of\r\nproducing from 50 to 200 or 300 or even 400 pounds of nuts within four\r\nor five years after the operation is started instead of waiting 20 or 25\r\nyears to get good commercial production.\r\n\r\nAs I said, a selection is made of the trees at the beginning. The\r\nselection is continued with each succeeding year as the trees grow\r\nlarger and additional trees are thinned out so that they stand\r\neventually a hundred or 150 feet apart, giving to each tree adequate\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThroughout the state we have a great deal of interest in propagation by\r\ntopworking of varieties of pecans. The experiment station made the\r\nserious error for 15 or 20 years in the early development of the\r\ninterest in the work in centering on the idea of changing these natives\r\nover to varieties. We now are swinging back to a proper evaluation of\r\nthe native nuts, and nobody is satisfied with the present varieties, our\r\ninterest of developing and the exploration and discovery of new\r\nvarieties being such that the Northeast Oklahoma Pecan Growers\r\nAssociation arranged two years ago to finance a contest for the\r\ndiscovery of seedling nuts which could be utilized in that territory and\r\nbe more profitable than any variety that we now have.\r\n\r\nWe don't like the Stuart because of its low quality. We don't like the\r\nStuart because it doesn't come into production until it reaches a\r\nconsiderable age. We just simply will not have the Mahan, because it\r\ndoesn't fill. We do not like the Success because it has a tendency to\r\nover-bear every other year and does not fill. We cannot use the\r\nSquirrel's Delight which for ten years or so we had at the top of our\r\nlist, because a special strain of scab fungus came in and completely\r\nwiped them out, and so on throughout the list of varieties that we have.\r\n\r\nWell, these growers decided to take the matter into their hands and in\r\ncooperation with the experiment station have been, during the past two\r\nyears, attempting to find some nuts which would be more desirable, and I\r\nthought those of you who are in the walnut exploration work would be\r\ninterested in learning how this is worked out.\r\n\r\nI don't suppose you can see this. It Is an entry blank for the grower.\r\nAnnual prizes of $50, $25, $15 and $10 are awarded. Ten awards are made\r\neach year, and the ten winning growers this year will have their\r\nparticular nut automatically entered in a grand prize contest hoping\r\nthat some of those nuts will be worth naming, and if any should be worth\r\nnaming, after further study, naming and introducing, the grower will be\r\nawarded a prize of $1,000.\r\n\r\nFour of the Tulsa, Oklahoma, crackers are financing this work by putting\r\nin $75 each annually. The college is cooperating in this respect, and\r\nwhen I say the college, I also mean the Extension Division. The\r\nExtension Director is pushing the matter and tells the county agents to\r\npay attention to these entry blanks when they come, and get as many\r\ngrowers in each county to send in samples as possible.\r\n\r\nThe contest closes on November 25th. Those samples are sent to the\r\ncollege, and in three or four days--and those of you in colleges will\r\nrecognize the Thanksgiving holiday--in three or four days' time those\r\nnuts are cracked and evaluated and placed. Last year, the second year of\r\nthe contest, there were over 200 entries, and it was no small job to\r\nfinish in time to get them on display at the annual meeting and show of\r\nthe Oklahoma Pecan Growers Association in early December.\r\n\r\nWe are not content with the evaluation of the nut. It is just one phase\r\nof successful production to have a nut which is satisfactory for\r\ncracking and consumption; unless those trees are free from disease and\r\nproductive and otherwise satisfactory we could never think of\r\nintroducing a variety. And so the staff at the college, as soon, as the\r\nshow is over, goes out and locates each of these trees individually and\r\nputs a tag on it. We visit each of those trees a sufficient number of\r\ntimes during the year to properly evaluate the tree.\r\n\r\nThe things that we are looking for, of course, are productiveness,\r\nfreedom from disease and other characteristics of that type. If, after\r\nfive years of observation, the tree characteristics are satisfactory,\r\nthen the nut will be certified as worthy of propagation.\r\n\r\nWe are getting some place with this program, as evidenced by the data on\r\nlast year's cracking contest. Normal seedling pecans yield about 33 per\r\ncent kernel to the packing plant. In last year's contest, as I say,\r\nthere were over 200 entries, and I was just looking to see what the low\r\nwas. I really haven't paid enough attention. The lowest entry apparently\r\nwas about 33 per cent, and the highest entry was 59 per cent kernel.\r\nOver 30 of these seedling nuts yielded better than 50 per cent kernel,\r\nand that is better than most popular varieties.\r\n\r\nThese nuts are relatively small. The cracker doesn't care how small they\r\nare, he wants a nut that handles well in the cracker, a nut that is the\r\nshape of a football. A miniature football is an ideal cracking type of\r\nnut. The cracking docks come together from the ends. We cannot use a\r\nround nut. About two-thirds of these good nuts which yielded over 50 per\r\ncent kernel were so round that the machinery in cracking would not place\r\nthe docks on the ends, but they were apt to hit anyplace. So they had to\r\nbe discounted.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a job to evaluate these nuts. We have been arbitrary about\r\nit. We haven't developed any scoring system, because there are so many\r\nvariable factors that it seems to be almost impossible to do so. In our\r\ngeneral plan of operation in the state we expect this native grove\r\nimprovement program that I described to continue, and as the trees get\r\nlarger the growers will topwork sprouts which develop from the trees\r\nwhich have been removed so that the thing goes on and on with a constant\r\nimprovement in the quality of the nut.\r\n\r\nWe also have many, many acres of nuts being propagated by topworking to\r\nvarieties rather than by letting the seedling continue to produce. That\r\nis the reason why we are so much interested in getting a better type of\r\npecan.\r\n\r\nOne man who makes it a commercial practice puts on thousands of scions\r\nevery year. We in Oklahoma can't understand why you all seem to have so\r\nmuch trouble propagating nut trees. It is just as easy to propagate\r\npecans and walnuts--not quite as easy--as apples, but then it isn't too\r\ndifficult. I think it is the attitude and frame of mind in which you go\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThank you very much, I appreciate the time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Thank you. Now, then, Mr. Magill of the University\r\nof Kentucky, will give us \"A Planned Program for Improving the Pecan\r\nIndustry in Southwestern Kentucky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Pecan Improvement Program for Southwestern Kentucky\r\n\r\nW. W. MAGILL, Extension Horticulturist, University of Kentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nThe production and marketing of seedling pecans in extreme southwestern\r\nKentucky has been of major importance for many years.\r\n\r\nThis industry naturally extends into northwestern Tennessee and parts of\r\nMissouri directly across the state line in the Mississippi River bottom.\r\nIt might be said that this industry was developed by nature, because in\r\nthe Mississippi River bottoms we find seedling pecan trees which\r\nundoubtedly are more than 100 years old. Some native seedling pecan\r\ntrees in this area are five feet or more in diameter; some have a spread\r\nof branches covering a radius of 60 feet, and are more than 100 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nThis industry took on considerable momentum about seven years ago when a\r\ngroup of local business men at Hickman, the county seat of Fulton\r\nCounty, developed a cracking plant known as the Roper Pecan Company.\r\nThey now have thirty modern cracking machines, with sorting belts,\r\ngrading machines, and other complete equipment, so that they are in a\r\nposition to receive and process a large tonnage of native seedling\r\npecans, merchandise the kernels and other by-products and, therefore,\r\nare able to purchase a large quantity of seedling nuts and operate their\r\nplant for eight months each year. Not having sufficient local nuts\r\n(\"Kentucky Kernels\") to take care of their business, they also buy not\r\nonly Kentucky nuts but also from Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, and\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Young Native Trees Top-Grafted+\r\n\r\nRealizing that this industry is here to stay and that many farmers of\r\nthat district have many young seedling pecans growing on their farms,\r\nthe Kentucky Agricultural Extension Service, cooperating with some of\r\nthe leading farmers of the district, has launched a program of\r\ntop-working these native seedling pecans with some of the known,\r\nimproved varieties that have a reputation for producing good yields of\r\nhigh quality nuts. The beginning of this top-grafting program was in\r\nlate April of 1948, when some 200 trees were top-worked mostly on the\r\nfarm of the late Roscoe Stone, a farmer in this area who had\r\nconsiderable land holdings. It is highly pleasing to our Extension\r\nworkers to observe what we think is an outstanding success in this first\r\nyear of development, for we find that over 90% of the five to ten year\r\nold trees that were top-grafted have developed a new growth from the\r\nspring grafting, to the extent of from two to eight feet of new growth.\r\nJohn Watts, County Farm Agent of Fulton County, who pioneered this pecan\r\nimprovement development, tells me that we already have requests for\r\ntop-working over 500 other trees in this area for the spring of 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Northern Varieties Preferred+\r\n\r\nThe best information available was sought from such pecan authorities as\r\nFord Wilkinson of Rockport, Indiana, Dr. A. S. Colby, chief in nut\r\nculture, Horticulture Department of the University of Illinois, Bob\r\nEndicott of Villa Ridge, Illinois, and others. They are of the opinion\r\nthat this southwestern Kentucky area approaches the northern limit of\r\nsuccessful production of known southern varieties of pecans, and that\r\nour success in our pecan grafting program can best be assured by\r\ntop-working to the hardy northern varieties of pecans such as the Major,\r\nGreenriver, Niblack, Giles, Goforth, and others.\r\n\r\nThanks to our pioneers of this generation who located some outstanding\r\nseedling pecans in the Ohio Valley, such trees as the original Major,\r\nGreenriver, and others have proved their worth as hardy northern pecans\r\nand they have been used for propagating purposes rather than being\r\ndestroyed by farm hands who burned piles of debris left by high water\r\naround many of these early trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Some Superior Local Nuts+\r\n\r\nWe are of the opinion that other seedling varieties are now growing in\r\nthis Reelfoot Lake area, maybe in Kentucky, maybe in Tennessee, or\r\nacross the line in Missouri, that are equally as good pecans, and, we\r\nhope, better, than the already named seedlings which have been mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nDuring early August it was my pleasure to spend a day in the Hickman\r\nbottoms with County Agent Watts and Mr. Ernest Fields, manager of the\r\nlocal nut cracking factory, together with Mr. C. B. Toombs, of Hickman,\r\nat which time we inspected a number of recognized successful native\r\npecan groves. Mr. Toombs knows that whole area and is familiar with the\r\npecan trees of outstanding quality and yield history, just as you and I\r\nknew where every tree stood in the old home apple orchard or that of\r\ngrandfather, where as boys we made frequent trips to get a pocketful of\r\nthose outstanding local variety apples.\r\n\r\nMr. Toombs pointed out to me a tree on his own farm that he said bears a\r\ncrop every year of from 300 to 400 pounds of nuts. In his own language\r\nhe described the tree in detail but the thing which impressed me was the\r\nfact that he had developed standing orders for private sales to\r\nindividuals from the crops of this one tree each year because they are\r\nof outstanding value. He showed us another tree on a neighbor's farm,\r\none which produced 700 pounds of nuts one year; another tree on which\r\nthe nuts were ready to harvest a month ahead of the nuts from other\r\npecan trees in that region. (Mr. Wilkinson, it strikes me that\r\npropagation from this early maturing tree might well find a place\r\nseveral miles north of the Mason-Dixon Line where normal fall frosts\r\noften injure the crops.)\r\n\r\nWe are of the opinion that with organized effort we can locate these\r\noutstanding individual trees, get enough scion wood from them and put it\r\nin the hands of a good pecan grower, and in a few years develop\r\nsufficient grafting wood so that we can top-work thousands of these\r\nyoung native trees in the district, thereby increasing not only the\r\nnumber of pounds produced per tree, but have a volume of production of\r\nthe very best quality of nuts. They tell me that one of the trees I\r\nobserved has a cracking percentage of above 60 as compared to many of\r\nthe native seedlings which have a cracking percentage of only 20-30 of\r\nnut kernels.\r\n\r\n\r\n+First Annual Nut Show in 1948+\r\n\r\nIn an effort to locate these outstanding seedling trees in an organized\r\nway, our Kentucky Extension Service, cooperating with the Fulton County\r\nFarm Bureau, local civic organizations, the local nut cracking plant,\r\nand the Northern Nut Growers Association, through its secretary, Mr. J.\r\nC. McDaniel, has made plans for a nut show to be held at the county\r\ncourt house in Hickman, Kentucky, in early December of 1948. The feature\r\nof the show with be the cash prizes offered for the best seedling\r\npecans. We request that the owners give us a history of the trees, the\r\nage, regularity in bearing, etc., with the nut show management reserving\r\nthe right to cut a few sticks of grafting wood from the winning trees.\r\nPrizes will also be offered for hickory and walnut seedling trees. An\r\neducational program is also planned in connection with the day's show,\r\nand it will include a visit to the farm of the late Roscoe Stone, where\r\na top-working program was started last spring, as well as a visit to the\r\nlocal nut cracking firm. This nut show is set up to become an annual\r\naffair, and we feel that the sky is the limit for the good that can come\r\nout of such an organized program as it affects the pecan industry in\r\nthat area.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of acres of excellent pecan land in this\r\nsouthwestern Kentucky area, that can be profitably developed into pecan\r\ngroves. The land is deep, very fertile, and is already well supplied\r\nwith moisture. We cannot question its being a natural home for pecan\r\nproduction, for nature proved this point to the public two generations\r\nago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT DAVIDSON: Pecan Culture in South Carolina by Mr. A. M. Musser,\r\nHead of the Department of Horticulture at Clemson Agricultural College\r\nis next. Mr. Senn will read the paper because Mr. Musser is not able to\r\nbe here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPecan Production in South Carolina\r\n\r\nT. L. SENN, Assistant Professor of Horticulture, Clemson, South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the southern colonies on the Atlantic coast, the pecan was first\r\ndescribed by Thomas Walter in his publication \"_Flora Caroliniana_\" in\r\n1787. He was an Englishman who had a plantation in St. John's Parish on\r\nthe Santee River, South Carolina, where he made an extensive collection\r\nof southern plants. After describing the tree, evidently a nursery\r\nspecimen, he ended with the words, \"The fruit I have never seen.\" It is\r\nknown now that the native range of pecan did not extend to the present\r\nstate of South Carolina. One of the first large pecan plantings in the\r\nstate dates back to 1890; This was a seedling planting of 1000 trees\r\nmade by John S. Horlbock at Charleston. Some of these trees are still\r\nproducing. The planting never proved profitable and has changed\r\nownership several times.\r\n\r\nThere are several small plantings of black walnuts, Chinese chestnuts,\r\nand Persian walnuts in various parts of the state. Persian walnuts do\r\nwell in the Piedmont soil region and in 1947 the trees there had a good\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Commercial Pecan Plantings+\r\n\r\nThe pecan, is one of the most popular tree nuts and is the only one\r\ngrown on a commercial scale in South Carolina. Pecans are grown in every\r\ncounty, although there is a comparatively small number of trees in most\r\nof the Piedmont and Mountain counties, and several counties in the lower\r\nCoastal Plain. Orangeburg County, with the largest number, had 27,528.\r\nPickens County, with the fewest trees, had 801. The total for the state\r\nwas reported as 227,027 trees.\r\n\r\nPecans are an important money crop of the state. During the last five\r\nyears the production of pecans has averaged three million pounds, which\r\nbrought farmers a yearly average of $500,000. The average yield per tree\r\nof bearing age in 1947 was only about 7 pounds, or 100 pounds per acre.\r\nEighteen cents was the average price received for improved varieties,\r\nand twelve cents for seedlings, during the ten-year period 1935-1944.\r\nWith these prices and yields per bearing tree, it is easily seen that\r\nthere is plenty of room for improvement, for the production of pecans in\r\nSouth Carolina by the average grower has not been very profitable during\r\nthe past nine or ten years. South Carolina has ranked fifth or sixth in\r\nthe production of pecans of improved varieties during the past several\r\nyears. While production from year to year has been up and down, the\r\ngeneral trend is up.\r\n\r\nThere are two general classes of pecan trees grown in South Carolina:\r\nseedlings and named or improved varieties. The average crop figures over\r\nthe ten-year period 1933 to 1942, show that six times as many nuts of\r\nimproved varieties were produced as of seedlings. South Carolina\r\nproduces about 6% of the pecan nuts of improved varieties in the United\r\nStates and less than 1% of the seedlings. The seedling trees are for the\r\nmost part given very little attention, receiving neither fertilizers nor\r\nsprays. They produce nuts of miscellaneous size, shape, and quality, and\r\nare usually smaller than the improved varieties. The cost of production\r\nof seedling pecans is small for they are usually grown in back yards, in\r\nchicken ranges, and in pastures.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of pecan varieties that are adapted to and grown in\r\nSouth Carolina. The most popular varieties are Schley, Stuart, Success\r\nand Moneymaker. A number of other varieties, including Teche, Frotscher,\r\nMahan, Pabst, Delmas, Van Deman, and Moore are grown in some sections.\r\n\r\nSchley is very susceptible to scab and should not be planted if a spray\r\nprogram is not carried out. Moneymaker, Stuart, and Success are not so\r\nvery susceptible to scab and are satisfactory where a complete spray\r\nprogram is not used. Some years ago several growers in one county\r\nordered Stuart trees and these trees, now bearing, turned out to be\r\nTeche, so there is some uncertainty as to the variety names in some\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nThe planting distance varies considerably, depending somewhat upon\r\nfertility of soil and length of growing season. Most of the plantings\r\nare too close, having as many as 20 or more trees per acre. Because of\r\nthe longer growing season in the lower half of the state, trees grown\r\nthere will be larger at a given age than those grown in the Piedmont\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Cultivation Methods+\r\n\r\nIntercrops or cover crops are usually grown to increase the income of\r\nthe farm. Cultivation programs vary according to the intercrop grown.\r\nPecan trees are grown on various types of soil, which also vary greatly\r\nin their fertility. Different fertilizers are recommended for these\r\nvarying conditions. Fertilizer is usually applied late in February or\r\nearly in March, several weeks prior to the swelling of the buds. The\r\nexact time of application varies according to the area in the state in\r\nwhich the trees are grown. Many of the soils of the state are probably\r\ntoo acid for best growth of pecans and the necessary winter cover crops\r\nthat should be grown in the plantings. In some soils that have been\r\nlimed, or where the soil pH is 7.0 or approximately so, the application\r\nof zinc, to the soil has not eliminated rosette. Few such conditions\r\nexist in South Carolina, but where these conditions do prevail, zinc\r\ntreatment is being tried in the form of sprays, using commercial spray\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable weather at blooming time often prevents pollination.\r\nInstances of cross-incompatability occurring between the varieties grown\r\nin this state are practically unknown. Late spring frosts sometimes kill\r\nthe male or female flowers or both.\r\n\r\nThe pecan in South Carolina is subject to attack by numerous insects and\r\ndiseases, just as it is in other places. Scab is the worst offender.\r\nSeveral species of borers are found attacking the trunks, the twig\r\ngirdler severing the tips of twigs, the shuck worm and case-bearer\r\naffecting the husk, and the pecan weevil affecting the nuts. Many of the\r\ntrees growing in South Carolina are not planted in sufficiently large\r\ngroves to justify the expenditure necessary for spray equipment.\r\nContract spraying has been done to some extent and has possibilities in\r\nSouth Carolina. Where the number of trees is small this will be the only\r\nway in which growers can afford to obtain the use of high pressure\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Marketing Conditions+\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Circular 301 gives the following account of the pecan\r\nmarketing situation in South Carolina. \"Most of the pecans in this state\r\nare sold in small lots. The assembling at a number of locations of\r\nthese small lots into lots large enough to make handling economical has\r\nbeen a great problem. It is believed that three auction markets properly\r\nlocated in the state would be the most satisfactory marketing\r\narrangement. If each of these markets would have one sales day per week\r\nso that buyers could attend sales at each place, the cost of marketing\r\ncould be greatly reduced.\" There are nine companies in five counties\r\nthat handle pecans.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather brief discussion relating facts about the pecan\r\nindustry in South Carolina, and most of the figures given are average\r\nfigures. Those plantings receiving good cultural practices give more\r\nsatisfactory returns. The pecans enterprise can be made a profitable one\r\nif the grower will carry out a complete program to overcome the problems\r\nof fertilization and control of diseases and insects and not just leave\r\nthe trees to fight the battle alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n+References+\r\n\r\nRawl, E.

I don't know how you feel, but I think it is a wonderful program.\r\n\r\nThe Storage of Shelled Pecans will be told to us by Professor Harris of\r\nthe Department of Horticulture of Alabama Polytechnic Institute of\r\nAuburn, Alabama. Professor Harris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreservation of Shelled Pecans by Drying and Hermetically Sealing\r\n\r\nHUBERT HARRIS, Associate Horticulturist, Alabama Agricultural\r\nExperiment, Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout some special treatment, storage life of pecans at ordinary\r\ntemperatures is rather short. Nuts held in common storage from fall\r\nharvest show noticeable flavor losses by spring. Staleness and rancidity\r\nare likely to follow as summer weather approaches.\r\n\r\nThese facts emphasize the need of a better method that might be used\r\nboth commercially and in the home for preserving the pecan over a long\r\nperiod at common storage temperatures. A satisfactory method might be\r\nused not only for preserving nuts for year-round use, but for carrying\r\nthem over from heavy crop years to light crop years.\r\n\r\nThis report presents the results of experiments conducted at the Alabama\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station on methods of preserving pecans.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Storage Troubles+\r\n\r\nSome of the common pecan storage troubles are staleness, rancidity,\r\ncolor changes, molding, and insect injury. Molding occurs only when the\r\nproduct is stored in a moist atmosphere at ordinary temperatures. Insect\r\ninfestation usually results when the shelled kernels are held in\r\nunsealed containers under ordinary storage conditions. Rancidity\r\ndevelops during the summer months when the product is stored by common,\r\nmethods at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nRancidity is probably the most common of pecan storage troubles; it has\r\nbeen considered the most difficult to control. Rancidity is usually\r\npreceded by general loss of flavor followed by staleness of kernels.\r\nColor gradually becomes darker as the typical rancid condition develops.\r\nThese changes are associated with and caused by certain chemical\r\nreactions that progress at a slow rate. The oils and fats are slowly\r\noxidized to aldehydes, ketones, and other chemical compounds (10), which\r\ncause the undesirable aromas and flavors characteristic of the rancid\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Review of Previous Work+\r\n\r\nThe period during which pecans will remain free of rancidity and other\r\nforms of spoilage varies considerably with storage conditions and other\r\nfactors. Common storage periods ranging from 3 to 12 months have been\r\nreported. Wright (10) placed the common storage life at 3 to 5 months.\r\nBlackmon (1) suggested 6 months as the maximum period. Medlock (11) was\r\nable to keep them in edible condition for periods up to 12 months. The\r\nwide ranges of time as observed by the different investigators are due,\r\nno doubt, to storage conditions, variety, quality of the nuts, and\r\nseasonal variations.\r\n\r\nCold storage was effective in preserving pecans for periods up to 2-1/2\r\nyears. Wright (10) reported effective periods of 13 to 30 months, and\r\nMedlock (11) was able to keep them for more than 2 years. Shelled pecans\r\ndid not keep as long either in common or cold storage as the unshelled\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Methods and Procedures+\r\n\r\nResults of preliminary tests made at the Alabama Station in 1937\r\nindicated that pecans kernels might be kept at common temperatures by\r\ndrying them in an oven and storing in sealed containers, which prevents\r\nabsorption of moisture from the air. Since storage tests reported by\r\nother workers did not include studies of the relationship of moisture\r\ncontent of kernels to their storage life, it was felt that this phase of\r\nthe problem should be investigated.\r\n\r\nPreliminary tests were made to determine suitable temperatures and\r\nperiods for the drying process. Temperatures of 200 to 225 deg.F proved to\r\nbe most satisfactory. These temperatures dried the kernels quite rapidly\r\nwithout appreciable scorching or discoloration. The drying period was\r\nvaried to give desired moisture contents for the various treatments.\r\n\r\nFour methods of sealing the jars were used in the experiments. They were\r\nthe \"cold seal,\" \"steam seal,\" \"hot seal,\" and \"vacuum seal.\"\r\n\r\nThe cold seal was accomplished by placing cool kernels in cool jars and\r\nsealing without special treatment.\r\n\r\nBy the steam seal, air was exhausted from the jars with a small blast of\r\nsteam and the jars sealed immediately. Condensation of the steam\r\nresulted in a partial vacuum in the jars and a slight increase in\r\nmoisture content of the kernels.\r\n\r\nBy the hot seal, hot kernels were transferred directly from the oven\r\npans to clean, dry, hot jars, and sealed immediately. Contraction of the\r\nair as the jars cooled resulted in a partial vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum seals were made in clamp-top fruit jars by means of a home\r\npressure cooker. Filled jars, with covers partially clamped, were placed\r\nin the cooker. The cooker cover was lubricated at the sealing surface\r\nand screwed down tightly. The pressure gauge in the top of the cooker\r\nwas replaced with a vacuum gauge. The needle valve was removed. An\r\naspirator was attached to the water faucet and connected to the needle\r\nvalve opening by means of a vacuum hose. After the desired vacuum had\r\nbeen pulled on the cooker, the vacuum hose was removed from the needle\r\nvalve fitting thus permitting air to rush back into the cooker. The\r\nsudden change in pressure automatically sealed the jars.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Presentation of Data+\r\n\r\nPreliminary studies were made to determine the effect of temperature and\r\ntime of drying on moisture content, color, and toasting of kernels.\r\nResults of these studies are given in Table I.\r\n\r\n   TABLE I.--Effect of Temperature and Time of Drying on Moisture Content,\r\n   Color, and Toasting of Pecan Kernels.\r\n   =================================================\r\n      Oven     Time in  Moisture  Change\r\n   temperature   oven      in       in    Degree of\r\n                         kernels  color[25]  toasting\r\n               Minutes  Per cent\r\n\r\n                  0       3.7      0.0          0\r\n                 20       2.6      0.5          0\r\n                 30       1.4      1            1\r\n                 37       1.2      2            2\r\n     225 deg.F       44       1.0      3            4\r\n                 51       0.5      6            8\r\n                 58       0.3      8           10\r\n                 65       0.2      8           10\r\n                 72       0.1      9           10\r\n   -------------------------------------------------\r\n                 10       3.2\r\n                 20       3.1\r\n     203 deg.F       30       2.9\r\n                 41       2.4\r\n                 50       2.2\r\n                 60       1.9\r\n   =================================================\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The numbers 0 to 10 indicate varying amounts of change in\r\ncolor or degree of toasting: 0 represents normal color and/or no\r\ntoasting. 10 represents considerable intensification of color and/or\r\ndevelopment of typical flavor of toasted kernels.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first series of the processing and storage tests was started in\r\nDecember, 1939. The treatments together with results are given in Table\r\nII. The different samples were dried in an electric oven at 225 deg.F to\r\nmoisture contents ranging from 0.1 to 3.4 per cent. They were sealed in\r\nglass jars, both with and without vacuum, and stored in a dark room at\r\nordinary temperatures. Those dried to 2.9 per cent moisture or less were\r\nstill good after 2 years in storage, whereas those with higher moisture\r\ncontent were rancid after one year in storage. Samples dried to\r\napproximately 2 per cent moisture were still good September 1, 1948,\r\nwhich was almost 9 years after processing and storing. The color was\r\npreserved somewhat better by vacuum sealing. However, the quality of\r\nair-sealed samples was practically as good as those that were vacuum\r\nsealed. These tests did not show how long kernels might have been kept\r\nby drying and storing in unsealed containers.\r\n\r\nTable II.--The Effect of Different Amounts of Drying and Different\r\nMethods of Sealing on the Storage Qualities of Pecan Kernels (Tests made\r\nat Auburn, beginning December, 1939.)\r\n\r\n =========================================\r\n\r\n                                  Per cent\r\n                        No. min.  moisture\r\n Methods of     Sample  in oven    in dry\r\n sealing [28]     No.     225 deg.F    kernels\r\n\r\n Cold-seal (a)    1        0        8.4\r\n Hot seal (b)     2       20        2.9\r\n                  3       30        1.6\r\n                  4       44        1.0\r\n                  5       51        0.7\r\n Steam-seal (c)   6        0        3.4\r\n                  7       50        0.2\r\n                  8       60        0.16\r\n                  9       65        0.10\r\n Vacuum-seal (d) 10        0        3.4\r\n                 11       20        2.7\r\n                 12       30        1.0\r\n\r\n =========================================\r\n\r\n =====================================================================\r\n\r\n                        When canned      After 12 mo.

Samples with moisture contents above\r\n 4.43 were treated in steam to obtain the desired amount of moisture.]\r\n\r\n [Footnote 30: Excessive increase in moisture content resulted in heavy\r\n molding of product.]\r\n\r\n A second series of processing and storage tests was started in December,\r\n 1940. These studies included tests of effect of moisture content, type\r\n of container, and sealing on storage qualities of Schley pecan kernels.\r\n Table III shows a portion of these tests together with the results\r\n obtained. It is pointed out that unsealed samples regained moisture and\r\n became rancid within 8 months in storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Summary+\r\n\r\nResults from the foregoing experiments show that pecan kernels can be\r\nkept for nine years by drying them to about 2 per cent moisture and\r\nstoring them in sealed containers. The best results were obtained by\r\ndrying the kernels in an oven for about 50 minutes at 200 deg.F. The exact\r\nlength of the drying period may vary somewhat with the moisture content\r\nof the undried kernels and the quantity of kernels dried at one time.\r\nThe temperature of the oven could probably be reduced without affecting\r\nthe drying time by using a fan for circulating the air in the oven.\r\n\r\nThis method will preserve the fresh qualities of pecans for a much\r\nlonger time and equally as well as such common methods as freezing and\r\ncanning preserve fresh qualities of other foods. It is felt that the\r\nprocess offers a practical and effective method that might well be used\r\nin the home as well as in commercial plants for preserving shelled\r\npecans for year-round use and/or for carrying over surpluses from a\r\nheavy crop year to supplement the light crops that usually follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Literature Cited+\r\n\r\n1.

Would your methods\r\nwith the pecan be adaptable to other nuts or kernels?\r\n\r\nProf. Harris: I have not tried other nuts, but I have thought quite a\r\nbit about the black walnut, and I would like to run some experiments. It\r\nseems to me that it would be adaptable to other nuts which have\r\nconstituents similar to the pecan such as black walnut, and perhaps\r\npeanuts. We intend to work some on the peanuts down there. Now, of\r\ncourse, in the case of the chestnut we more or less checked it out on\r\nthat, because when you dry the chestnut down to low moisture content you\r\nhave a hard product that is not palatable and is quite undesirable.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Now comes the follow-up studies on the 1946 Ohio\r\nblack walnut prize winners. Mr. L. Walter Sherman has prepared something\r\non that matter but Mr. Sterling Smith, I believe, is going to read that\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow-Up Studies on the 1946 Ohio Black Walnut Prize Winners\r\n\r\nL. WALTER SHERMAN, Mahoning County Experiment Farm, Canfield, Ohio\r\n\r\nIn 1946 a black walnut contest was conducted in Ohio that brought out\r\nroughly 800 samples of nuts from all sections of the state. Judging on\r\nthe characters of the nuts only, there were ten selected as prize\r\nwinners.\r\n\r\nNotice that I say on nut characters only. In 1950 a grand prize is to be\r\ngiven to the tree selected from these ten trees that has been the\r\noutstanding performer for the five year period. We want to know more\r\nabout these trees. Do they produce regularly? Do the nuts fill well each\r\nyear? Are the trees young or old? On what kind of soil are they located?\r\nJust what are the factors that cause them to produce such superior nuts?\r\n\r\nIn order to try to answer some of this type of questions each of the ten\r\ntrees was visited in 1947 and a careful survey of each was made. This\r\nwas done in August, at which time the crop prospects for 1947 could be\r\nnoted. Mimeographed blanks such as the following were used to record the\r\ndesired data.\r\n\r\n Tree Name\r\n\r\n                                      Latitude ____________\r\n\r\n Name of Owner ______________________ Address _____________\r\n\r\n County _______________ State __________ State Route ______\r\n\r\n Telephone ___________________\r\n\r\n TREE    Isolated [] ; moderately crowded [] ; dense woods []\r\n\r\n LOCATION   Types of trees in vicinity _____________________\r\n            Air drainage ___________________________________\r\n\r\n            Level [] ;  Slope [] ; Direction of slope ______\r\n\r\n TREE SIZE  Circumference 4-1/2 feet from ground ___________\r\n\r\n AND SHAPE  Probable age ____ ; limb spread [] ; tall [] ; short [] ;\r\n\r\n            open-branched [] ; symmetrical [] ; irregular [] ;\r\n\r\n SOIL    Sod [] ; plowland [] ; bottom [] ; upland [] ; hillside [] ;\r\n\r\n CONDITIONS clay [] ; alluvial [] ; loam [] ; sandy [] ; pH []  ;\r\n\r\n            Distance to subsoil ______ ; kind of subsoil ________\r\n\r\n            Humus [] ; lack of humus [] .\r\n\r\n DRAINAGE   Nearness to spring [] ;  tile drain [] ;  well [] ;\r\n\r\n            lake [] ; stream [] .\r\n\r\n FERTILITY  Fertilized [] ; manure [] ; commercial fertilizer [] ;\r\n\r\n            lime [] ; not fertilized [] .\r\n\r\n                    PERFORMANCE CHART\r\n\r\n Resistance to disease and insects:\r\n\r\n Blight______; Witches' Broom______; Caterpillars______;\r\n\r\n 1947        1948        1949        1950\r\n\r\n 1947        1948        1949        1950\r\n\r\n Bearing:  G F S F\r\n\r\n Good; Fair; Scattering; Failure.\r\n\r\n                               1947     1948     1949     1950\r\n\r\n Season:  Date of leafing out\r\n\r\n Male:    Date of blossoming\r\n\r\n Female:  Date of blossoming\r\n\r\n          Date of ripening\r\n\r\n          Date of killing frost\r\n\r\n          Last in spring;\r\n            first in fall\r\n          Rate of growth\r\n\r\n          Moisture; Rainy,\r\n              dry, average\r\n\r\n Clusters:  Size                    1947     1948     1949     1950\r\n            Range in number of nuts\r\n                per cluster\r\n\r\n Production: Size of crop in proportion to size of tree\r\n\r\n                                     1947     1948     1949     1950\r\n\r\n\r\n Percentage of unfilled nuts:\r\n                                      1947     1948     1949     1950\r\n           R*H\r\n --------------------crop\r\n           pounds\r\n\r\n * R = 1/2 limb spread.\r\n * H = height; lowest branch to top.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these data, photographs, both in black and white, and in\r\ncolor, were taken of the trees and often of the surroundings, and a map\r\nmade so that the trees can be located in the future by any one wishing\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nFor examination by any one wishing to do so, there are on the\r\nsecretary's desk copies of the case histories, as written up, of the\r\nfirst and second prize winners, the Duke and the Burson.\r\n\r\nA careful study of these ten trees has not revealed any single factor\r\nthat can be pointed to as essential to the production of a superior\r\nwalnut variety. They were found on good and on poor soils, on good and\r\npoor sites, in soils of a wide range of pH values from very acid to\r\nalkaline in reaction. Most of the trees were located in the southern\r\npart of the state at 39 deg. to 40 deg. North Latitude, but it is hard to\r\nimagine that the latitude has any specific effect on the superior\r\nqualities of the nuts.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where the trees were now standing in impoverished soils,\r\nlow in humus, fertility, and in pH value, it was quite evident that the\r\nsoil was probably in far better condition when the trees got their start\r\nfifty to a hundred or more years ago.\r\n\r\n+Winter Killing 1947-1948+\r\n\r\nIn 1947 scions of six of these prize winning trees were successfully\r\ngrafted into established ten year old black walnut seedling trees at the\r\nMahoning County Experiment Farm at Canfield, Ohio, location 41 deg. north\r\nlatitude. The scions grew nicely in 1947 but all were winter killed\r\nduring the winter of 1947-1948 with the exception of one scion of Kuhn\r\nand one of Davidson. Two scions of Duke, two of Kuhn, one of Athens, one\r\nof Orth, seven of Jackson perished during the first winter after\r\ngrafting. This severe killing of 1947-48 apparently indicates that\r\nwinter injury to these varieties may be expected some years when they\r\nare planted under conditions similar to those at the Mahoning County\r\nExperiment Farm. The one scion of the Davidson variety came through in\r\nfine shape, so this would be the exception.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1947-48 was unusual in the severity of the winter injury\r\nto the black walnut trees at the Mahoning County Experiment Farm. Two\r\nten year old Stabler trees and a ten year old Jansen tree killed back to\r\nthe ground level, and one year old growth of Cowle, Havice, Jansen,\r\nMurphy, Mohican, Ohio, Stambaugh, Twin Lakes, and Lisbon was badly\r\ndamaged although not always completely killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Winter Killing of Bench Grafts+\r\n\r\nBench grafts that were still in the hot bed and were not transplanted to\r\nnursery rows until spring of 1948 fared much better than the grafts\r\ngrowing in the established trees. As they had no winter protection but\r\nthe side walls of the hot bed it is a little hard to see why they fared\r\nso much better.\r\n\r\nOne bench graft of the Duke, two of Burson, four of Kuhn, two of\r\nDavidson, three of Orth, two of Williamson, two of Penn, and six of\r\nJackson all came through in good shape.\r\n\r\nIndications certainly point to the conclusion that the prize winning\r\nvarieties of the Ohio 1946 contest are adapted to the southern part of\r\nthe state rather than to the northern part. The Davidson is a possible\r\nexception to this.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith: I asked Mr. Silvis why Mr. Sherman wasn't here, and he said\r\nhe wasn't able to come because he was doing the same type of work this\r\nyear, and it is very evidently the reason why he wasn't at the last\r\nmeeting because he was preparing this work. Instead of coming and\r\nenjoying the convention, he stays home and does work that helps the\r\nAssociation, so I think the Association is very much indebted to him.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I think that is true.\r\n\r\nThat makes it possible for us to close in good time. I think this\r\nprogram is tops. I think it is by far the best program I remember.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Let's give Mr. Chase, the Program Chairman, a big hand.\r\n\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: We will now adjourn.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, at 4:30 o'clock, p. m. the meeting was adjourned to\r\nreconvene for business session after the banquet.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+Tuesday Evening Business Session+\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: There is a little business that remains to be done.\r\nIn order to let Mr. Slate get away, we'd like to have a report of the\r\nCommittee on Place of Meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: The committee consisting of Royal Oakes, myself and two\r\nothers, conferred with each other. We have considered the matter of a\r\nmeeting place for next year, and we think, and those we have talked with\r\nthink, that perhaps Beltsville would be the best place. It does not seem\r\nfeasible to have a meeting in the Middle West. The New York City region\r\nwill probably be better for us a year later. The other good places we\r\nhave visited rather recently. So we are recommending that the place of\r\nmeeting be Beltsville.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to consider the time of meeting now, or will we vote on the\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Let's act on that now. First, may I have a motion?\r\n\r\nA Member: I will move we hold our next convention at Beltsville,\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded, vote taken and motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Now, time of meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: It has been customary for us to have our meeting early in\r\nSeptember, about Labor Day. Next Labor Day is the 5th of September. Now,\r\nwe are not making any recommendations as to time, but if we follow our\r\npast custom we will probably meet about the 6th, 7th and 8th. Some of\r\nyou might like to come later to avoid the Labor Day traffic, but that\r\ninterferes with some of those who have teaching duties, registration,\r\nand so forth, at that time of the year. Personally, I do not think that\r\nthe Labor Day traffic is insurmountable. It is rather unpleasant in\r\ncertain areas, but we can make it all right, and we have made it.\r\nPerhaps I should recommend the dates the 6th, 7th and 8th, which are\r\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: You have heard the report. What shall you do with\r\nit?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: I move its adoption.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded, vote taken and motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Next, I should say, we would like to have a report\r\nof the nominating committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: The Nominating Committee reports for the consideration of the\r\nmembers the following list of candidates:\r\n\r\nFor president, H. F. Stoke from Virginia. Vice-president, L. H.\r\nMacDaniels from New York. For secretary, J. C. McDaniel from Tennessee,\r\nand treasurer, Sterling A. Smith from Ohio.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: You have heard the report of this committee. I\r\nshould say that in this case nominations from the floor would be in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nA Member: Mr. President, I move that nominations be closed.\r\n\r\n(The motion was seconded, vote taken, and motion carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: That was on the motion that nominations be closed.\r\nWhat is your pleasure, shall we vote by ballot or shall we vote by--\r\n\r\nA Member: Mr. President, I move that the secretary be instructed to cast\r\na unanimous ballot for those nominated by the Nominating Committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Fisher: Second.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: This gavel I should have called to your attention\r\nbefore. It is called to your attention at the end of our program, and so\r\nyou know its story. The other one that has been used in our past\r\nmeetings was sent to me by Mr. Reed. It is \"An Historical Gavel,\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association.\" I understand from Mr. Reed that this\r\nwas a piece of wood sent to Mr. Littlepage and turned by him and made\r\ninto a gavel, and this little metallic name plate sunk in by Mr.\r\nLittlepage, who is one of the very early members of our association. So\r\nwe have two historic gavels. Rather interesting, I think.\r\n\r\nOne other matter. The question has come up in view of the fact that the\r\nnext annual report will be larger than normal and also in view of the\r\nfact that the membership dues have been raised to $3.00, whether it\r\nshould not be wise and fitting to charge $3.00 for the coming 1948\r\nreport instead of the old price of $2.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: $2.00 is the current price for the last two issues of the\r\nreport to non-members. If that is allowed to continue the man who\r\npurchases a report without becoming a member will get it for one-third\r\nless than the members do.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: What is your wish?\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: Mr. President, I say that they should not be given any more\r\npreference than the members, so let them pay $3.00 like the rest of us.\r\nI make it in the form of a motion.\r\n\r\nA Member: Second.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Moved and seconded that the charge for the\r\nforth-coming report of this Association be made $3.00 to non-members. Of\r\ncourse, that report goes to all members, as you know. Are there any\r\nremarks on this motion?\r\n\r\nMr. Slate: Mr. President, what about the matter of supplying reports to\r\nlibraries? In the past we supplied libraries at $1.00 a copy. I don't\r\nknow whether Mr. McDaniel has had any special requests.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: I haven't had any orders from libraries during the past\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Shall we make a difference for libraries? What is\r\nyour feeling?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Mr. Chairman, if we have had a differential before I\r\nthink that might be continued. I will propose a motion that libraries be\r\nallowed to purchase the proceedings for $2.00.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: Do you make that in the form of an amendment?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Yes.\r\n\r\nMr. Weber: I accept that amendment.\r\n\r\nA Member: It meets the second's approval.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: The motion is then that a charge for the\r\nforth-coming report shall be $3.00 to non-members, except that the\r\ncharge shall be $2.00 to libraries and similar organizations, if that is\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the motion, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: I have a report to read, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n+Report of the Auditing Committee+\r\n\r\nThe Auditing Committee has examined the records of our treasurer, D. C.\r\nSnyder, for the fiscal year just closed and has found them correct as\r\nreported and commends him for his excellent service to our Association.\r\n[Signed] R. P. Allaman, Royal Oakes, _Auditing Committee_.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: You have heard the report. What will you do with it?\r\n\r\nA Member: I move that the report be accepted.\r\n\r\nA Member: Second.\r\n\r\n(A vote on the motion was taken, and it was carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nDr. Crane: Mr. President, members of the Association: Most of the\r\nthunder that the Resolutions Committee had has been taken care of either\r\ntonight or at various meetings that we have had. These resolutions have\r\nbeen rather spontaneous at these meetings. However, the Resolutions\r\nCommittee, for a matter of record, does make the following report:\r\n\r\n\r\n+Report of the Resolutions Committee+\r\n\r\nThe Northern Nut Growers Association in its annual meeting assembled at\r\nNorris, Tennessee, September 13th to 15th, 1948, adopts the following\r\nresolutions:\r\n\r\nThat, our sincere thanks be extended to Mr. George F. Gant, General\r\nManager of Tennessee Valley Authority, the members of his staff,\r\nespecially to Mr. Willis G. Baker, Director of the Division of Forest\r\nRelations, Mr. Spencer Chase, Mr. Thomas G. Zarger, and others, for the\r\ncourtesies extended and for making-the necessary arrangements for\r\nholding the meetings and caring for the needs of those in attendance.\r\n\r\nThat we extend thanks and appreciation to Mrs. Willis G. Baker and the\r\nother ladies of her committee who provided and served the refreshments\r\non Sunday evening and assisted in arrangements for the banquet.\r\n\r\nThat we extend thanks to Mr. Spencer Chase and the other members of the\r\ncommittee for the very interesting and instructive program.\r\n\r\nMay we extend our thanks to those who presented papers and otherwise\r\ntook part in the program.\r\n\r\nWe greatly appreciate the very fine work being done by our Secretary, J.\r\nC. McDaniel. _Resolutions Committee_, Stoke, Silvis, Sterling Smith, and\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: You have heard this report, and I think it is well\r\nthat we have had it in the form so that it could be a part of our\r\nrecord. What will you do with it?\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels: Move the acceptance of the report.\r\n\r\nMr. McDaniel: Second.\r\n\r\n(Vote taken on motion, carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\nPresident Davidson: I have here a telegram that I should like to read to\r\nyou, and this is the way it is worded: \"Your generously worded telegram\r\nis greatly appreciated. I am grateful beyond all words. My greetings to\r\neveryone present tonight. C. A. Reed.\" We are glad to have the word from\r\nMr. Reed.\r\n\r\nOur business meeting is now adjourned.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, the program and business sessions of the Thirty-ninth Annual\r\nMeeting of the Northern Nut Growers Association were closed.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n(On September 15, the members were conducted on a tour of the nursery,\r\narboretum, and experimental nut plantings of the Tennessee Valley\r\nAuthority near Norris.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOdds and Ends\r\n\r\nDR. W. C. DEMING, West Hartford, Connecticut\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest, especially to the younger members of the\r\nassociation, three horticultural projects that I believe promise to be\r\nof importance, and on which nobody that I know of is doing any work.\r\nOnly one of these projects has to do with a nut.\r\n\r\n1. Utterly neglected and wasted, the fruit of the horsechestnut or\r\nbuckeye, \"said, to have been formerly used as food or medicine for\r\nhorses,\" still might become an abundant food for animals, and perhaps\r\nfor man, if a way could be found to deprive it of its disagreeable\r\nbitter taste and reputed, probably exaggerated, poisonous quality.[31]\r\n\r\nThere is one late flowering horsechestnut, _Aesculus parviflora_, a\r\ndwarf species from the Southeast, and commonly seen in Connecticut as an\r\nornamental on lawns, which bears a nut entirely free from bitterness,\r\nand is sometimes known as the edible horsechestnut. The possibilities in\r\ncrossing this with the bitter horsechestnut tree species are evident and\r\nfascinating. [Several hybrid horsechestnuts are cultivated, but none of\r\nthese apparently involves any _A. parviflora_ parentage.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n2. In temperate zones there are, so far as I have learned, no\r\n_perennial_ legumes the seeds of which are used as food. All our\r\nimmensely valuable edible leguminous seed crops are annually planted.\r\nThe only exception I think of is the honeylocust, the pods of which,\r\nunder favorable conditions, are sometimes used as fodder for horses and\r\ncattle. But there are thousands of leguminous plants and trees, many of\r\nthem hardy. I mention the herbaceous _Baptisia australis_, several hardy\r\nperennial peas, such as _Lathyrus sylvestria_, _L. maritimus_ etc.,\r\n_Caragrana_ the pea tree, and species of _Robinia_, _Cercis_;\r\n_Cymocladus_ and _Wistaria_. A collection of these, with as many more as\r\none might wish, would be a fascinating group in which to spend hours\r\nwith brush and forceps.\r\n\r\n3. All over America thousands of \"tired business men,\" and school boys\r\nwho ought to be tending to their baseball, have to spend weekends and\r\nholidays pushing lawn-mowers. If an acceptable ground cover could be\r\nfound that would have to be mowed only half as often, or one quarter as\r\noften, or maybe only once a year, or even (glory be) not at all, what a\r\nsaving of time it would be for good healthy sport and non-depressing\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nThere are many promising plants. _Pachysandra_ and _Vinca_, don't quite\r\nfill the bill but have their good points, such as growing in the shade.\r\nThere is a little round-leafed plant common in Florida and, apparently,\r\nfound in the north. There are many plants that could be grown\r\nexperimentally in patches a yard square. Why have we so tamely limited\r\nourselves to grasses and clover? What a chance for a man to immortalize\r\nhimself by discovering variants for grasses and clover for lawns and\r\nthus become a benefactor to millions of lawn-mower slaves!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: (_See letter from the American Medical Association on next\r\npage.--Ed._)]\r\n\r\n   COUNCIL ON PHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n   of the\r\n\r\n   AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\r\n   Office of the Secretary,\r\n   535 N. Dearborn Street, Chicago 10, Illinois\r\n\r\n   January 5, 1949\r\n\r\n   Doctor W. C. Deming\r\n   31 South Highland Street\r\n   West Hartford, Connecticut\r\n\r\n   Dear Doctor Deming:\r\n\r\nThis is in reply to your inquiry of December 28, 1948, regarding the\r\ntoxicity of horse chestnuts.\r\n\r\nAll six of the species of Aesculus which are native to the United States\r\nhave been reported as poisonous, but specific references in the\r\nliterature are infrequent. The species Aesculus hippocastanum has been\r\nstudied and has been found to contain saponin, tannin, and the\r\nglycoside, esculin. Esculin is used in patent remedies in the form of\r\nointments and pastes to protect the skin from sunburn. The saponin seems\r\nto be the toxic component.\r\n\r\nFruit of the horse chestnut is rich in starch and oil and is a _valuable\r\nfood for livestock_. The bitter taste of the nut is removed by alcohol\r\nextraction which removes the saponin, thus rendering the nut harmless.\r\nCertain domestic animals, however, seem to be able to eat the untreated\r\nnut without suffering ill effects. [_Italics are by Dr. Deming.--Ed._]\r\n\r\nMost of the saponins are markedly irritant to the mucous membranes. They\r\nhave an acrid taste and provoke a flow of saliva, nausea, vomiting and\r\ndiarrhea. If injected directly into the circulation they produce\r\nhemolysis, diuresis and direct actions on the central nervous system\r\nwhich may be rapidly fatal. Absorption after oral administration is so\r\npoor that saponins produce only local effects. The toxicity of various\r\nsaponins is ten to a thousand times higher by vein than by mouth and is\r\ngenerally proportional to the hemolytic action. Some saponins have a\r\ndifferent toxicity for different species.\r\n\r\nIn experiments with rats Hindemith found that the saponin from Aesculus\r\nhippocastanum is not toxic in daily oral doses of 87.5 mg. per kg.\r\nNonhemolytic doses injected intravenously in cats have no effect on\r\nrespiration or blood pressure; hemolytic doses produce a sudden drop in\r\npressure owing to liberation of potassium from the _erythrocytes_. The\r\nsaponin increases the activity of the isolated frog heart, then stops it\r\nin systole. In frog nerve muscle preparations of this saponin reversibly\r\ninterrupt stimulus transmission; recovery occurs upon washing.\r\n\r\nFor a general review of the literature you are referred to Bull. Sc.\r\nPharmacol. 47:290 (November-December) 1940, which is available at the\r\nNew York Academy of Medicine Library, 2 East 103rd Street, New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n   Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   [Signed]\r\n   BERNARD E. CONLEY, R. Ph.\r\n   Administrative Assistant.\r\n\r\n   BEC:nr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Birth of a New Walnut Cracker\r\n\r\nB. H. THOMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home of the Thompson walnut cracker is the home of the maker, on the\r\nfarm, five and a half miles northwest of Harrisonburg, in the Shenandoah\r\nValley of Virginia. I live in the upland area, 1,500 to 1,700 feet up in\r\nthe hills.\r\n\r\nA man once said he killed two birds with one stone. I went him one\r\nbetter in one instance. I went to the back end of the farm and picked up\r\nall the walnuts and placed them on a pile, not too far from the house.\r\nThen the squirrels came to help themselves. I got all the squirrels I\r\nwanted to eat and those that got away retreated so fast they dropped\r\ntheir walnut. Then I cracked what walnuts were left for cakes and candy,\r\nwhich we all enjoy so much.\r\n\r\nIt was while cracking these nuts with a hammer that the thought came to\r\nme: Why should there not be a faster and better way to crack nuts? Later\r\nI happened to see a walnut cracker made by a blacksmith which did a very\r\ngood job of cracking, but was entirely too slow for me.\r\n\r\nBeing mechanically inclined, I have always entertained a desire to\r\ninvent something worth while. I set out to perfect a cracker that would\r\nbe fool-proof, easy to work, fast, simple, and strong enough to last a\r\nlifetime. This I accomplished in the Model 6. Before reaching this\r\npoint, I had designed and tested five different models, made five\r\ndifferent ways, to see which would be best. They all worked, some good,\r\nsome I did not like so well. It was discouraging at times but something\r\nseemed to tell me I had the right principle.\r\n\r\nThis No. 6 walnut cracker is a success, now in its 11th season and going\r\nstronger all the time. You will find it in 37 states, from Florida to\r\nWashington State, from New Hampshire to California, from Minnesota to\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nMost of the crackers are sent by mail, and some of the customers mention\r\nthe fact that they are members of the N.N.G.A. Others do not have trees\r\non their premises, but collect walnuts by the roadside. One I know of\r\nhas 2,000 walnut trees on his 1,200 acre farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarketing of Black Walnuts in Arkansas\r\n\r\nT. A. WINKLEMAN, Rogers, Arkansas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Benton County Produce Company has been in the walnut business for 38\r\nyears. For the first few years we dealt only in hulled nuts, shipping\r\ncarloads of them to Omaha, Chicago, several points in Nebraska, and the\r\nWest Coast. About twenty years ago, as I recall, there was a large\r\ncracking plant at Kansas City and we shipped several carloads there.\r\n\r\nEventually we began to receive small orders for kernels. We filled them\r\nand the number of orders increased. This led us finally to the decision\r\nthat we should get out of the hulled nut business and sell only kernels,\r\nand with few exceptions, that's what we have been doing for the past 25\r\nyears. During this time the production of kernels throughout the walnut\r\nregion has gone up tremendously. As you know, many plants using\r\nmechanical cracking machines have become established. We have stuck to\r\nhand-operated crackers; but even so, we were able one year to turn out\r\n13,000 pounds of kernels. At present we ship kernels to practically\r\nevery state in the Union.\r\n\r\nMillions of pounds of walnuts are available from Arkansas, Missouri and\r\nTennessee. Here the walnut tree seems to make its best growth. It has\r\nbeen our experience that the better nuts come from upland trees. Those\r\nproduced in the bottomlands along the larger streams lack the rich\r\nflavor typical of those coming from higher elevations. This means we get\r\nour best nuts from the Ozarks in northern Arkansas and southern\r\nMissouri. So far, few walnut trees are grown commercially. Practically\r\nall of the nuts come from wild trees. But recently there seems to be a\r\ntrend toward planting grafted walnut trees and grafting native seedlings\r\nto improved varieties. The nurseries in this area now have walnut\r\nseedlings for sale and some landowners are setting out considerable\r\nacreages. It seems like a good investment. The trees grow fast, bear\r\nnuts at an early age, and eventually yield additional income in the form\r\nof logs. We believe walnut offers better prospects for commercial\r\nproduction than pecan, owing mainly to the value of the walnut wood for\r\ncabinet uses.\r\n\r\nNot much has been done here with improved varieties. There are some\r\nThomas trees in the region and they yield very well. You get about 20\r\npounds of kernels from 100 pounds of hulled Thomas nuts as against an\r\naverage of 12 pounds from our wild native nuts. We anticipate that\r\nwithin three or four years the Thomas will attain commercial importance\r\nhere. In my opinion, however, _Thomas kernels do not have the flavor\r\nthat the wild nuts have_; the percentage of oil seems to be less. I have\r\nalso been told that wood from the Thomas trees has little value in the\r\nfurniture trade. Why this should be true, or whether it is true, I don't\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nShells are a problem with us as they are with most concerns in the\r\nwalnut cracking business. We sent some samples to Iowa State College for\r\ntesting and got a pretty favorable report. If available in sufficient\r\nquantity, the shells apparently can be used for gas production, oils and\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\nWalnut in this region has few enemies; but one, the walnut _Datana_\r\ncaterpillar, does considerable damage. We need federal or state aid in\r\ncontrolling this dangerous pest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Notes on Nut Tree Guards for Pasture Plantings\r\n\r\nOLIVER D. DILLER, project Supervisor, Hillculture Research, Soil\r\nConservation Service, Wooster, Ohio\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an article entitled, \"Nut Trees for Ohio Pastures,\" which appeared in\r\nthe 37th annual report of the Northern Nut Growers Association[32], the\r\nwriter called attention to the advantages of nut trees planted in fence\r\nrows and in the interior of permanent pastures and the need for a more\r\nsatisfactory cattle guard to protect the trees during their period of\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nut Easy Tree to Guard Install]\r\n\r\nThe writer has for several years studied various types of cattle guards\r\nand in 1946 suggested the possible use of an electric guard along\r\npermanent fence lines. This set-up worked fairly well during the first\r\ngrowing season, but it was found that a considerable amount of\r\nmaintenance is necessary and therefore electric guards may not be\r\npracticable over a period of years.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1947 a prominent wire fence manufacturing company\r\nwas contacted concerning the availability of a welded wire fabric which\r\nmight be used as a substantial yet economical tree guard. The company\r\nmade available for test purposes two 150-foot rolls 72 inches high. One\r\nroll was galvanized, 11 gauge wire, with 2 x 4 inch staves, while the\r\nother was ungalvanized 10 gauge, with 4 x 4 inch spacing between the\r\nstaves. These rolls were cut into lengths of 13.7 feet, resulting in a\r\ncircular guard 4.36 feet in diameter (shown in picture). The guards were\r\ninstalled along a permanent fence on the pasture research farm of the\r\nOhio Agricultural Experiment Station at Wooster during the summer of\r\n1947. Observations made during July, 1948, indicate that these guards\r\nhave not been damaged in any way by the dairy cattle on this farm during\r\nthe current season, and that the trees are being adequately protected.\r\nNo guards have as yet been installed in the interior of the pasture, but\r\nit would seem that only one standard fence post would be required to\r\nsupport such a guard.\r\n\r\nThe wire company was not able to give the exact cost of this material to\r\nthe farmer, but suggested a quotation of $3.90 per hundred square feet\r\nfor the galvanized wire, 2 x 4 inch spacing, 11 gauge, as compared to\r\n$3.00 per hundred square feet for the ungalvanized wire, 4 x 4 inch\r\nspacing, 10 gauge.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the ungalvanized wire would serve the purpose for a\r\nperiod of ten years, the cost would be approximately $2.50 per guard if\r\nit were attached to a line fence; If placed in the interior of a field,\r\nthe cost of a standard fence post would have to be added. While this\r\ncost may appear to be rather high, it is believed that it will compare\r\nfavorably with another type guard which will provide equal service. The\r\nchief advantages of this guard seem to be its apparent sturdiness and\r\nease of installation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Diller, O. D. \"Nut Trees for Ohio Pastures,\" Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association, Inc., 37th Annual Report. 1946, pp. 62-64.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Pecan Orchard in Gloucester County, Virginia\r\n\r\nMRS. SELINA L. HOPKINS, River's Edge Flower Farm, Nuttall, Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Reed has asked me to tell you of our experience with pecans in\r\nGloucester County, very near Chesapeake Bay, on North River, a tidewater\r\nestuary of Mobjack Bay. Our house is about 20 feet from the shore, so we\r\ncall it \"River's Edge,\" which describes it very well. The pecan trees\r\nare on the lawn, in the barnyard, and in an adjoining field.\r\n\r\nThe orchard was planted by my late husband about 1915. The trees came\r\nfrom at least two nurseries as there are two distinct sets of varieties.\r\nThere are eight varieties from the North and eight from the South. Of\r\nthe northern sorts there are Busseron, Butterick, Indiana, Kentucky,\r\nMajor, Niblack, Posey, and Warrick. These came from the nursery of R. L.\r\nMcCoy, Lake, Spencer County, Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe southern varieties are Delmas, Frotscher, Georgia (Georgia Giant),\r\nHale, Schley, Stuart, Teche, and Van Deman. Hale trees have been the\r\nslowest to come into bearing, and there are several which appear to be\r\nHale which are not yet in fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Nut Crops Scanty+\r\n\r\nThe trees near the house, both on the lawn and in the barnyard are set\r\nirregularly but those in the orchard are in rows, 65 feet each way. They\r\nare beautiful in appearance, being from 40 to 55 feet tall, and are very\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, they do not bear well. We had a pretty good crop in 1943, about\r\n500 pounds, which we sold for 30 and 35 cents per pound. Since then we\r\nhave had very few nuts, as the flowers have evidently been killed each\r\nyear by frost.\r\n\r\nMost of the nuts we have had have come from trees near the river, where\r\nthe air is tempered by salt air coming in at high tide. At this writing,\r\nearly August, there seems to be more nuts than at any time since 1943.\r\nThere was no frost that I could detect after the trees flowered, but\r\nthere are few nuts on the trees farthest from the river.\r\n\r\nThe fruit trees back in the county, on what we call \"the highlands,\"\r\nhave no fruit this year. Apparently our northern varieties of pecan do\r\nnot stand the cold any better than the southern sorts. In the last few\r\nyears, there have been more nuts of the southern varieties. I suppose\r\nthe flowers of the northern varieties came out at a time when they were\r\nmore easily frozen.\r\n\r\nWe have several trees that are evidently seedlings, as they grew up from\r\nthe ground after the tops died, They usually bear well, producing sweet\r\nnuts, well-flavored but small.\r\n\r\nWe have six Persian walnuts that have had only about ten nuts in all\r\nthese years. One tree has a black walnut coming up from the root on\r\nwhich it was grafted. It is of the same size as the Persian top. Two\r\nyears ago, this tree had about 30 nuts on the Persian side and 50 on the\r\nblack. It is not easily accessible and I have not been to it this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Behavior of Pecans+\r\n\r\nThe Posey trees are in an east-west row about one-third the distance\r\nfrom the north end of the orchard. Most of the Major and Busseron trees\r\nare farther south, some as much as 200 yards. A few trees of both\r\nvarieties are directly south, within 100 yards, while others are the\r\nsame distance away off and some farther southwest. It is stated in a\r\nrecent bulletin of the Virginia Agricultural Extension Service that\r\nPosey is needed to pollinate Busseron and Major.\r\n\r\nSince reading the bulletin, I have been thinking of our crops in the\r\npast. I remember that trees of these two varieties farthest from the\r\nPosey, do not bear as well. Until now, I have attributed this to the\r\nfact that the soil was less fertile and the trees are smaller and less\r\nvigorous. Also the trees are farther from the frost-tempering river. I\r\nam not sure yet that this is not the reason.\r\n\r\nWe are not alone in our experience of an uncertain crop, as other pecan\r\ngrowers in the county tell the same tale. There are a number of large\r\nold trees in this general section of Virginia, as well as a good many\r\nseedlings. In addition, there are native, bitter, large-growing water\r\nhickory (_Carya aquatica_), which is not uncommon in lowlands. (These\r\nhybridize freely with true pecans, producing beautiful trees but\r\nastringent nuts. Ed.)\r\n\r\nOne of the largest orchards was set out a few years before ours, by the\r\nlate Dr. Wm. C. Stubbs, on a farm that had been in his family for many\r\ngenerations. It is on York River, about 15 miles from our place. It was\r\nhe who encouraged my husband to set out our orchard. Dr. Stubbs was for\r\nmany years Director of the Louisiana Experiment Station near New\r\nOrleans. He spent his summers at his old home. His trees were probably\r\nthe best started and cared for during his life, as he knew how to do it.\r\nI drove to see the farm recently, and talked with the present owner, who\r\nbought it in 1942. The next year, when I also had my good crop, he\r\nnearly paid for the place with proceeds from the nuts.\r\n\r\nHowever, like ourselves, he has had practically no nuts since, and is so\r\nmuch discouraged that he plans to take out some of the trees. The\r\nvarieties there are mostly Moneymaker, Schley and Success. The same\r\nvarieties are also in a small orchard of another neighbor, who reports\r\nthat Success does best. The trees owned at one time by Dr. Stubbs seem\r\nnot to be cultivated at all, but are grazed and mowed, and the orchard\r\nis now rather a tangle of briers and weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n+We Grow Bulbs with Pecans+\r\n\r\nAs this is primarily a daffodil farm, and the trees have the best land,\r\nit is also used for bulb growing. The daffodils are a much surer crop\r\nwith us than pecans. We sell both flowers and bulbs. The season for\r\ndaffodils is in March and April which is well ahead of the pecans. The\r\npecans do not leaf out early enough to shade the daffodils, and I can't\r\nsee that they injure them in any way except in very dry years. Bulbs\r\nnear the trees do just as well as those in the open field and sometimes\r\nbloom earlier.\r\n\r\nAll cultivation and fertilization that the trees get is what is accorded\r\nthe bulbs. As soon as the season is ended for bulbs, we begin\r\ncultivating. We go over the bulbs about three times before the tops die\r\nback to the ground, in late May. In late July, we mow the weeds, which\r\nare high by that time. We frequently mow again later in the fall. We\r\ntake up the bulbs every two or three years in June, cure them in trays\r\nin airy buildings, grade them, sell some, and replant what we need to\r\nkeep up our supply. When a plot is dug, we plant it with soybeans, turn\r\nthem under in late summer and replant with a winter cover crop, rye or\r\nclover usually. That crop is turned under the following late April when\r\nthe rye is usually waist high. We replant again with beans which are\r\nturned under in July.\r\n\r\nIf we think the soil needs more humus, we repeat the process another\r\nyear. During this rotation we apply 0-14-7 at least twice, usually with\r\nthe first two plantings. The land is limed only at long intervals, as\r\ndaffodils like a soil rather on the acid side. Of course, during this\r\ncultivation and planting, we plow rather close to the trees, within\r\nabout four feet, and sometimes cut the roots. You may well think that\r\nthis accounts for their not bearing well, but in this neighborhood there\r\nis the same story with trees that are not plowed around. I have wondered\r\nat times if they are not too near salt water, and maybe the roots go\r\ndown to water, yet the trees nearest the river bear best. We have a\r\nTeche tree only about 20 feet from high tide line, and it is our surest\r\nbearer, having never missed a crop.\r\n\r\nOur only varieties that scab to any extent are the one Georgia and the\r\ntwo trees of Delmas, but the man on Dr. Stubbs' place says that both\r\nvarieties scab although I forgot to ask which variety was worst. (Delmas\r\nis one of worst scabbing varieties in the South.--Ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndiana Nut Shows Have Educational Value\r\n\r\nW. B. WARD, Extension Horticulturist, Purdue University, Lafayette, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago I had a letter from Professor George L. Slate, of the\r\nGeneva station, requesting that I send you some information concerning\r\nour recent nut shows and a couple of pictures to be used in the current\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nI am enclosing two pictures--one showing a display of hicans, shellbark,\r\nshagbark, bitternut, mockernut hickories and in the background a few of\r\nthe miscellaneous sorts, while the other picture shows mostly the black\r\nwalnuts. (Latter picture printed on next page.--Ed.)\r\n\r\nIf you will note in the pictures, we have used a saw and cut the nuts in\r\ntwo for display purposes. This has been one means of classifying the\r\nseedlings to find out whether or not they were worthy of further\r\npropagation, although this alone was not the final classification. It\r\nwas rather surprising to the number of visitors we have had at our shows\r\nto see the difference in the interior of the nut and believe me it has\r\ndone a lot toward the education of the people when it comes to locating\r\nsome of the better seedlings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the nut program in the state of Indiana was for the\r\nbetterment of native nuts and we were in hopes that we could find some\r\nvery promising seedlings that would be worthy of further work. With the\r\ncooperation of the Indiana Horticultural Society and the Student\r\nHorticultural Show here at the University, we have had this nut show for\r\nthe past six or eight years. Sometimes it has been in competition, other\r\ntimes it has been mostly for display. The show served the purpose which\r\nwe had in mind for thus we have located some very nice walnuts, hickory\r\nnuts and a few good seedling pecans. After the show had been visited by\r\nsome six to eight thousand annually for the past several years, we have\r\nfurther made displays at the annual meeting of the Indiana Horticultural\r\nSociety in Indianapolis, at the A.P.S. meeting at St. Louis last winter\r\nand at the Indiana State Fair in 1948, with a display going to some of\r\nthe other institutions--particularly to Oklahoma and Texas--for display\r\nat their state shows. A new collection was gathered by the students and\r\nthe writer this year which, in part, will be displayed at the Indiana\r\nHorticultural Society meeting on January 19, 20 and 21 and another\r\ncollection is being shown at Oklahoma A. & M. at this time. The nuts\r\nwill be returned and placed in cold storage to be exhibited at the State\r\nFair next fall and we have sufficient quantities on hand for individual\r\ndisplays as well as for collections.\r\n\r\nEach plate contains from 35 to 40 nuts of seedlings or named varieties\r\nand at our recent show we had 66 plates of hickory nuts and allied\r\nspecies. We had 41 plates of walnuts including some very fine Persian\r\nwalnuts, 16 samples of filbert seedlings, 20 plates of miscellaneous and\r\nall told 141 different plates at our show which was held on November 5,\r\n6 and 7, 1948.\r\n\r\nSome of our best contributors have been such as Ferd Bolten, Linton,\r\nIndiana, who sent five good Persian walnuts and one excellent black\r\nwalnut. Edward Smith, of Rochester, Indiana, and Henry Buit, of\r\nLafayette, also have found some wonderful walnut seedlings. Donald Sly,\r\nRockport, Indiana, has produced the best seedling filberts, about eight\r\nin number, and contributed a wonderful display of the McCallister hican.\r\nMr. J. F. Wilkinson, Proprietor of the Indiana Nut Nursery, has\r\ncontributed largely to the collection of seedling and named varieties of\r\nhardy northern pecan while W. A. Owen, Poseyville, and Clem Seib,\r\nOwensville, have been consistent winners in the large shellbark\r\nhickories. O. W. Thompson, Owensville, and William Seng, of Jasper,\r\ncontributed some large size thin-shelled shagbark hickories to our show.\r\nJames Stall, of Brownstown, is a consistent winner in butternuts.\r\n\r\nEach year more interest is being shown in the planting of native nuts\r\nand some of our Persian walnuts are rather outstanding. Nolan Fateley,\r\nFranklin, Indiana, has a very fine seedling Persian walnut of large size\r\nwhich we are hoping to propagate. (A large Carpathian tree.--Ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Stock and Scion Relationship in Hickory and Walnut\r\n\r\nCARL WESCHCKE, St. Paul, Minnesota\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years of practical study and living with the hickories ought\r\nto suffice to make a success in growing these trees for their delicious\r\nproduct. However, it is only in the twenty-eighth year of such work that\r\nI have made an important discovery about the particular hickory with\r\nwhich I have had the most success; I refer to the variety known as the\r\nWeschcke shagbark hickory.\r\n\r\nI began to graft such varieties as Beaver and Fairbanks\r\n(bitternut--shagbark hybrid) hickory on Wisconsin native bitternut\r\nhickory (_Carya cordiformis_) in 1920, and some grafts are doing very\r\nwell at this time, 1948, but they are practically barren of fruit.\r\nSince then I have accumulated more varieties to test from many different\r\nsources, to continue the work down to the present day. During that time\r\nI noticed, but did not appreciate, the significance of the relationship\r\nof growth between scion and root system. True, I have been very\r\ncognizant of the so-called compatibility between stock and scion in the\r\nhickory family, and have written about this matter for publication\r\nseveral times, but I was then more concerned with the stock and scion\r\nliving together in a harmonious state of existence and health without\r\nrealizing that there was something else necessary to this relationship\r\nin order to promote heavy bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Experiments in Grafting Black Walnuts+\r\n\r\nParallel to these early experiments, I was grafting in the same family\r\nas the hickories, known as the walnut, or _Juglandaceae_ family, using\r\nwild native butternut (_Juglans cinerea_) as a stock for grafting to\r\nsuch varieties as the Thomas, Ohio, Stabler and Ten Eyck black walnut\r\n(_J. nigra_). Some of these trees, so grafted, exist today, being more\r\nthan 25 years old, and they have never borne more than a hatful of\r\nwalnuts to a tree, even when they became large trees. Most of them are\r\nentirely barren year after year. I often remarked to persons who were\r\ninterested in this phase of my work, that the black walnut was\r\nnon-productive on the butternut root system, but it was very evident\r\nthat there was not completecompatibility because the walnut scion\r\ngreatly outgrew the butternut stock causing a marked difference in their\r\ntrunk diameters just below and above the union. This great difference,\r\nthe butternut being so much smaller, was no doubt the cause of a\r\nshortage of food supply elaborated through the bark circumference which\r\nlimited the top to a mere growth of leaves, not leaving sufficient\r\nadditional supply for the growth of fruit.\r\n\r\nMy observation among the hickories, with which I did far more\r\nexperimental work than with the walnuts, was beclouded by the fact that\r\nmany successful, apparently compatible varieties, grew and throve on the\r\nnative bitternut stock without bearing fruit, except for just a few nuts\r\noccasionally; and yet there was no apparent difference between the scion\r\ndiameter and the trunk diameter, nothing like the overgrowth of the\r\nblack walnut when grafted on butternut. So it took many years and a\r\ndifferent growth phenomenon to open my eyes as to what was the trouble\r\nin getting hickories to bear on foreign root systems.\r\n\r\nThe final solution of the problem was determined by my observation this\r\nyear of grafted hickories of several sizes and ages were Weschcke\r\nshagbark (_C. ovata_)[33] scions and other hickory scions, such as\r\nSiers, Bridgewater, Deveaux, Beaver, and Fairbanks have been grafted on\r\nthe same tree to act as pollinators for the Weschcke, which is devoid of\r\npollen.[33] This year particularly, the difference in rate of growth\r\nbetween two varieties grafted on the same stock was very apparent; in\r\nevery case all other varieties greatly exceeded the growth of the\r\nWeschcke hickory, but in many cases, only the Weschcke hickory had any\r\nnuts growing on the graft, and if there were any nuts on another graft,\r\nthere were but a few. In practically all cases, the diameters of the\r\nscions of varieties of hickory other than the Weschcke were at least\r\ntwice the diameters of the Weschcke grafts, and the growth of all\r\nvarieties so grafted was healthy and vigorous and thoroughly compatible\r\nwith the native bitternut hickory root system.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I had to trim some of these other varieties back in\r\norder to allow the Weschcke graft to get more growth because it was so\r\nbackward in development that it looked as though it might be crowded out\r\nof existence. It never occurred to me in those years that it was the\r\ndifference in rate of growth between the two varieties which was really\r\nresponsible for the difference in the diameter of the scion growth, and\r\nnot some accident of propagation. Now it is very apparent, from the many\r\nexamples that I have about me, that the Weschcke hickory is about\r\none-half as fast a grower as such varieties as Bridgewater, Deveaux,\r\nLaney, Siers, and many others. This, then, accounts for the heavy\r\nbearing of the Weschcke when it starts to bear on the bitternut roots,\r\nand it also explains the lack of bearing in such varieties as Beaver,\r\nFairbanks, Laney, Siers, Pleas, Deveaux, Rockville, Green Bay, Hope\r\npecan, Stanley shellbark, Platman, Kirtland, Glover, Barnes, and many\r\nothers which are hardy and get along well with the native bitternut root\r\nsystem, some of them having lived more than fifteen years grafted in\r\nsuch combination. The Bridgewater is the only variety which bears a fair\r\ncrop of nuts as compared to the prolific Weschcke, and is the pollinator\r\nfor the Weschcke when used in orchard planting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: See author's added remarks following.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Are Pecan Stocks Desirable for Hickory Scions?+\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that it is necessary for stocks to be at\r\nleast as vigorous as the variety to which they are grafted, and to\r\ninsure this it would seem to me that the northern pecan seeds, such as\r\ngrow around Des Moines, Iowa, would be the proper seedling stock for\r\nalmost any variety of hickory, as they outgrow bitternuts and shagbarks\r\nby quite a margin. I have only one Weschcke grafted on a pecan of this\r\nsort, and it makes much greater growth each year than does this variety\r\ngrafted on the native bitternut stocks. However, it has not started to\r\nbear yet and the reason is that it is still very young, and is\r\nover-topped by plum brush and apple trees.\r\n\r\nSince it requires about ten years here for a native bitternut to acquire\r\nthe proper size of one-half inch to three-quarter inch diameter, which\r\nis about the size necessary for grafting, you have some idea of how\r\nslowly this native species grows. The forest trees, of which there seem\r\nto be thousands on my property, very seldom exceed a diameter of six\r\ninches, yet they appear to be very old trees. Occasionally we find one\r\nthat reaches the diameter of a foot or more, and generally it is one\r\nthat is located where it has plenty of space to grow, as in open\r\npasture. The tree is rather easy to graft to many varieties of\r\nhickories. No doubt if it were grown in large numbers, in the proper\r\nsoil, the time for producing seedling stock ready for nursery\r\npropagation could be cut down. But it appears more likely that some\r\nnorthern pecan seed can be found which will produce a hardy understock\r\nto furnish a seedling of sufficient vigor and size for propagating\r\npurposes in five years or less.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Records of Bearing+\r\n\r\nOur first successful grafting of Weschcke hickory on bitternut hickory\r\n(_Carya cordiformis_) was in 1927, but these grafts did not bear for\r\nabout ten years. We know now that this was because there was a lack of\r\npollen of the shagbark species to pollinate its blossoms. Now these\r\ntrees are bearing profusely.\r\n\r\nThe second batch of grafts from the original Weschcke hickory, which\r\ngrew near Fayette, Iowa, was made in 1934. One mature nut from grafts\r\nmade that spring was gathered from the ground in the same year, about\r\nOctober 1, 1934, but it had been partly consumed by a squirrel. From\r\nthat year to the present, these grafted trees produced each year and\r\nnever failed to mature some edible nuts up to and including this year,\r\nwhen there is a very large crop (6-1/2 bushels). This, then, is the 15th\r\nconsecutive crop of nuts of which I have a record. During two years we\r\nhad such early fall frosts that the nuts were a little shriveled and not\r\nfully mature, but still edible. In other years there were some light\r\ncrops, but there never has been a crop failure in all this time. The\r\nvariation in bearing is also due in part to several late frosts which in\r\nthe spring in some years killed back all the foliage and newly expanding\r\nbuds. Yet new dormant buds opened, some of which had flowers, and so\r\ncarried on the unbroken bearing record.\r\n\r\nLast winter (1947-48) produced the most severe damage to exotic species\r\nof fruit and nut trees as well as ornamentals, including evergreens,\r\never recorded in this area; yet the grafted Weschcke hickory trees were\r\nso loaded down with nuts that I had to support the load by tying up\r\nbranches to keep them off the ground. This tough winter caused almost\r\nevery variety of apple tree to be barren, such as Wealthy, Northwestern\r\nGreening, Whitney Crab, Haralson and Malinda. Only two varieties,\r\nLowland Raspberry and Hibernal, bore fair crops. Last winter killed\r\noutright (to the ground) most of my Thomas black walnuts, some of which\r\nwere more than 25 years old, and damaged severely such other varieties\r\nas Ohio, Vandersloot, and Ten Eyck. The winter was responsible also for\r\nthe killing of several seedling Chinese chestnuts which had survived ten\r\nyears of our winters and yet others of these Chinese chestnuts are\r\ngrowing again from sprouts near the ground surface. The mulberries\r\nsuffered greatly also, but in general the hickories of many varieties\r\ncame through this winter, with very little damage, and most of them are\r\nbearing a few nuts. Even the wild hazels suffered differing amounts of\r\ndamage and have only partial crops of nuts because of the effects of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, keep in mind that these experiments and tests have been\r\nconducted in severe climatic conditions in the 45th parallel at River\r\nFalls, Wisconsin, 35 miles east of St. Paul, Minnesota, and that out of\r\nmore than fifty varieties of hickories and pecans and their hybrids\r\ntested, only these two, Bridgewater and Weschcke hickory, (both\r\nthin-shelled easy-cracking varieties), have succeeded to a point which\r\ncan be classed as commercial; the writer can now recommend these two\r\nvarieties for propagation by nursery firms capable of undertaking the\r\npropagation of hickory nut trees, the sale of which to the public is a\r\nforegone conclusion.\r\n\r\n_By request of the secretary, Mr. Weschcke sent the following additional\r\ninformation on the Weschcke hickory:_\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago I noticed that there was no pollen coming from this\r\ntree and yet from the very beginning, even when there was no other\r\npollen available except the wild hickory pollen from the _Carya\r\ncordiformis_, the Weschcke hickory produced nuts. Thinking that it was\r\ndue to parthenogenesis I bagged clusters of pistillate blossoms, and\r\nalthough setting nuts they all dropped off which is typical of\r\nnon-pollenization. I then bagged groups of pistillate blossoms which I\r\npollinized with different available pollens of the _Carya ovata_ and\r\nthese set nuts which started to grow, upon which I removed the bags.\r\nFrom this experiment I found that the Bridgewater did a very good job\r\nof pollenization and it became the tree that I considered as a\r\ncompatible mate. Other trees that pollinate well are Kirkland, Deveaux\r\nand Glover; Beaver is not a good pollenizer and I have not experimented\r\nwith Fairbanks to know whether it is satisfactory. The catkins grow\r\nvigorously on the Weschcke up to the time that the pollen sacs seem\r\nready to open, then the catkin drops off. No pollen has ever matured\r\nthat I know of. When dried from this state, they yield no pollen.\r\n\r\nI told Dr. J. W. McKay about this nearly seven years ago, and he asked\r\nfor fresh samples of the catkins at different periods which I mailed to\r\nhim in receptacles that he furnished. He wrote me a very nice treatise\r\non this subject for inclusion in my book which I expected to be\r\npublished at that time. The book was never published, however, since\r\nOrange Judd turned it down during the war for lack of paper as the\r\nexcuse. I did not try any further to get it published, and since that\r\ntime many new things should be added to the hazel hybrid chapter. Dr.\r\nMcKay said that he is familiar with this action on the part of nut\r\ntrees. I have felt that it was phenomenal since I have had no other such\r\nexperience among all the nut trees with which I have experimented.\r\nHowever, this loss of pollen saves vitality apparently for the\r\nproduction of several times the pistillate bloom that I have seen on any\r\nother hickory with which I have worked and this apparently accounts for\r\nthe prolificacy of the Weschcke when grafted on the native Wisconsin\r\nhickory. (Male-sterility occurs with chestnut and apple.--Ed.)\r\n\r\nAt first I considered the Weschcke somewhat of a hybrid nut; later I\r\nchanged my mind about it and considered it a pure shagbark. I have\r\nreversed my opinion again and consider the possibility of its being\r\nslightly hybrid with bitternut blood. The parent tree at Fayette, Iowa\r\nstood close to big bitternuts. The shell, being the thinnest of all\r\nhickories (known to me) leads me to suspect the hybridity with the\r\nbitternut. It is quite smooth and the ridges are less prominent than in\r\nalmost any other hickory except such known hybrids as the Beaver. Its\r\nshape is oval to long and it is flat so that whenever you throw a\r\nhandful down to a smooth surface they all assume the same position, and\r\nbecause of this they would no doubt lend themselves to commercial\r\ncracking as they would feed through the mechanism of a cracking machine\r\nexactly in the same order.\r\n\r\nI have not always had such a high opinion of this nut. Dr. Deming has\r\nletters from me which have a disparaging note, and although Dr. Deming\r\nconsidered it a valuable nut, he has letters from me in which I\r\nindicated that I was sorry that it was not productive and that it had\r\nsuch a small nut. Both these conditions changed with time and within\r\ntwenty years this nut sometimes becomes one of the largest hickories of\r\nthe cultivated varieties and its proficacy then probably depended on\r\ncorrect pollination which I was not aware of in the beginning.\r\n\r\nI hope you will pardon me for dwelling so on this hickory, but after\r\nworking with hickories for nearly thirty years it certainly seems\r\nremarkable to me that we have such a productive variety that is hardy\r\nthis far north and west, that is perfectly at home on the native hickory\r\nroots, and that matures its nuts from September 15 to October 1, is\r\nself-hulling, that has escaped the attack of all sorts of weevils that\r\ninfest our native nuts. (I have never found one wormy Weschcke hickory\r\nnut although sometimes you find empty nuts.) This variety also escapes\r\nthe spring frosts so that there have been fourteen consecutive years of\r\nbearing without interruption. The foliage is vigorous, has no diseases\r\nso far; the young branches are sometimes cut off by oak tree pruners or\r\ngirdlers. This happens to many kinds of trees, including all the oaks,\r\nbutternut, black walnut, all the hickories and even the chestnuts. When\r\nyou take into consideration the fact, that no other hickory has such a\r\nfine record it makes me very enthusiastic over this variety in spite of\r\nthe fact that it bears my name. Were you to classify this hickory from\r\ncasual observation, you would think it is a pure shagbark, and it is\r\nonly the extreme thinness of shell and the outside appearance pf the nut\r\nshell which indicates some slight hybridity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress with Nuts at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire\r\n\r\nMATTHEW LAHTI\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I do not expect to be able to attend the thirty-ninth annual\r\nmeeting, I thought I would report to you on the progress of my nut trees\r\nsince my letter of a year ago.\r\n\r\nLast winter was a severe one in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire (43 deg. 36' north\r\nlatitude.) We had more than the usual amount of snow, and although the\r\ntemperature did not get down much lower than 25 deg. below zero at my place,\r\nit remained cold for many days at a time without relief. This, and the\r\nfact that last fall was one of the driest seasons on record, plus the\r\nfact that this spring it rained almost continuously for more than a\r\nmonth, resulted in considerable damage to my nut trees.\r\n\r\nMy Broadview Persian walnut graft suffered severe damage, with branches\r\nup to two inches in diameter being killed. Whether this was from frost\r\nor lack of moisture in the fall I do not know, but two Crath Persian\r\nwalnuts, one of which is situated within fifty feet of the Broadview,\r\nsuffered no apparent winter injury at all. Neither Broadview nor Crath\r\nbore any nuts this year, whereas last year the Broadview produced\r\neighteen nuts.\r\n\r\nMy Gellatly heartnut also suffered severe winter injury similar to the\r\nBroadview Persian walnut, and after it leafed out it looked as if a fire\r\nhad gone through it because of the dead wood. However, it is bearing\r\nthirteen nuts this year.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the black walnut trees did not suffer any winter injury\r\n(the Thomas, set out in the spring of 1939, having been injured in each\r\nprevious winter), except that the Tasterite is barren of nuts this year\r\nagainst a pretty good crop last year. However, the Thomas is bearing a\r\nfair crop, but the nuts are smaller than usual.\r\n\r\nWhile my hickory trees appeared to suffer no winter injury, out of\r\npossibly two dozen that I have planted since 1939 I expect to have only\r\nthree left. The number had dwindled to nine last year, and six of those\r\nI am afraid will be dead by the end of next year. These six had done\r\nwell for six or seven years. The cause appears to be poor circulation\r\nthrough the graft union. This is unfortunate as I believe hickory trees\r\nwill live and bear fruit in our climate.\r\n\r\nI had the usual experience with filberts and hazelnuts, namely that the\r\ncatkins were, for the most part, Winter killed. There, are no nuts on\r\nRush, Barcelona, Medium Long, or Red Lambert, and the Winkler bushes\r\n[self-fertile--Ed.] which bore heavily last year (although the nuts did\r\nnot fully ripen), are bearing only a few nuts this year.\r\n\r\nNative butternut trees last year bore a heavy crop of nuts. This year,\r\nthe crop is very light.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, I planted three Chinese chestnuts this spring:\r\nAbundance, Nanking, and a \"straight line\" seedling. Although I haven't\r\nmuch hope that they will survive many winters, I thought I would try\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\nSeveral people have inquired about nut growing in New Hampshire, and I\r\nhave sent them a resume of my experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreeding Chestnuts in the New York City Area\r\n\r\nALFRED SZEGO, Jackson Heights, New York City\r\n\r\n[Part of a letter to the Secretary, October 27, 1948.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am one of those members who have not been able to attend annual\r\nmeetings. In the two or three years that I have been a member, I have\r\nderived great enjoyment from reading the annual reports and receiving\r\ninformation through your news bulletin.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when I received your improved bulletin, \"The Nutshell,\" I\r\nfelt that I and others like me should write and tell you how wonderful\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nThere is much that I just want to \"get off my chest.\" My past criticism\r\nwas that the organization was a bit lethargic. But nut trees are _slow_\r\nin showing results, despite the nurserymen's attractive visions of\r\nquick, big harvests of nuts and even timber!!! This slow patience of the\r\nblack walnut has determined the tempo of much of the membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Chestnut Breeding Efforts+\r\n\r\nMy main work is to attempt to breed two types of chestnuts: (1) One that\r\nis very productive with a low head and will bear nuts like the old\r\nAmerican chestnut. (2) Another that will make a good timber stick. It is\r\nmy theory that present chestnut breeders are crossing inferior material,\r\nusing any specimens that happen to be in flower at the right time as\r\nlong as they represent the species to be crossed.\r\n\r\nSuppose they intend to cross _C. crenata_ x _C. dentata_. An average\r\nJapanese chestnut is usually pollinated with flowers from a poor\r\nstruggling sprout on the edge of the woods that has only one thing to\r\nrecommend it. That is an early bearing characteristic which is inherent,\r\nbut which, according to experiments and observations I have tediously\r\ncarried out, _is not totally due to ringing by the blight_.\r\n\r\nThe experiment takes place and a few hybrid nuts are produced. They are\r\ntermed (_C. crenata_ x _C. dentata_). It is expected that the\r\ncharacteristics of the offspring will be somewhere between those of the\r\ntwo parents in blight resistance and nut size and quality. But what of\r\nthe grandparents, the many ancestors of the American chestnut sprout\r\nthat have not even the slight resistance of the sprout? Can they not\r\nexpress their characteristics and hand them, down to their\r\ngrandchildren? And some individuals of _C. crenata_ are not reputed to\r\nbe so highly blight resistant.\r\n\r\nOf course the scientists engaged in this work are men of the highest\r\ncalibre and no doubt are aware of this, but it is extremely difficult to\r\nobtain, propagate, and care for named varieties of the finest\r\nindividuals of each chestnut species.\r\n\r\nApple, cherry, and other fruit breeders would not dream of crossing\r\ncommon scrub cull fruit trees and expect any degree of success.\r\n\r\nMy first task when I began, three years ago, on my coppice growth 35 to\r\n40 year old hardwood forest, was to clear a little land and to begin\r\nplanting different world species of _Castanea_.\r\n\r\nYou would be astonished to find that it was impossible for me to obtain\r\nseed or trees, at the time, of _C. crenata_, _C. seguinii_, _C. pumila_,\r\n_C. henryi_ and _C. alnifolia_. I obtained some 24 seeds of _C.\r\nmollisima_ from Dr. A. H. Graves, for which I was grateful. At the time\r\nhe didn't have a good crop, I think. Institutions and government\r\nagencies would not or did not like to release their newly developed\r\nhybrids for fear that I was a nurseryman or perhaps would sell them for\r\n\"blight resistant\" chestnuts, although they were not yet proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Experiment at Pine Plains+\r\n\r\nBy diligent search I managed to get a few trees and hybrids of _C.\r\ncrenata_ and a variety (seedling of) called \"Colossal.\" These thrived\r\nand survived about 30 deg. below zero under deep snow at Pine Plains, New\r\nYork. I also set out 2 bushes (_C. pumila_) obtained from Harlan P.\r\nKelsey, East Boxford, Massachusetts. Dr. Graves' seed gave fair\r\ngermination, and I now have seven nice young _mollisimas_ from 8\" to 30\"\r\nhigh. Of two three year old trees I obtained from a local nursery, one\r\ndied (my fault) from not reducing the top, and the other died back to\r\nthe ground from winterkill, but came back again as sprouts. I easily\r\nobtained seed of _C. sativa_, but the severe winter mowed the seedlings\r\ndown and there are only two survivors. One is smaller this year than\r\nlast but the other is about 14\" high and making slow, straight growth.\r\nThe _chinkapins_ are perfectly hardy and this year one of them made _3\r\nfeet of growth_.\r\n\r\nI estimate that I have some 3,000 to 4,000 American chestnut sprouts\r\nthat range anything from 1 to 18 feet in height. But more promising--I\r\nhave a cluster of fine young seedlings that I have been caring for. All\r\nthe woods were cleared away from them to give them plenty of light. They\r\nare watered by the old hand bucket method in dry spells. I report on\r\nthem occasionally to Mr. G. F. Gravatt and Mr. Russell B. Clapper of the\r\nU.S.D.A. They are a faint ray of hope.\r\n\r\nFour of them are about from 18 to 20 feet tall. One is about 9 feet\r\nhigh. One blighted and died two years ago and was removed. Another\r\nblighted at the base and I cut the canker out, but I fear it's going.\r\nOne branch is dead and was removed. The others developed strong blight\r\nresistance. Small cankers formed on the lower branches but did not make\r\nheadway. I cut some of these out and the trees healed nicely. As the\r\ntrees become older, their resistance diminishes and the proof lies\r\nahead. One tree that I labeled No. 1 has about two dozen, well healed\r\n_Endothia_ scars already. The trees have not bloomed for me yet but I\r\nmay have some results soon. I intend to cross this clonal group with the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. With _C. seguinii_ for greater blight resistance and productivity.\r\n\r\n2. With _C. mollisima_ (var. Abundance) for blight resistance, fine nuts\r\nof medium size, and a good timber stick with good vigor.\r\n\r\n3. With large Japanese like Austin, and their hybrids like \"Colossal,\"\r\nfor a medium size nut of fair quality and highly prolific for the\r\ngeneral market for a cooking or roasting chestnut.\r\n\r\nThough many people dislike the Japanese chestnuts, they are at least\r\nproductive and hardy (at my place). Their chief attribute is their\r\npossibility as food for stock and wildlife. Some of the same people who\r\ndislike them (among nurserymen) recommend planting oaks which certainly\r\ndo not compare with _C. crenata_. When a very \"sweet\" acorn is found it\r\nis proclaimed to be \"as good as Japanese chestnut.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese chestnut has its faults here. It is not very thrifty in\r\ngrowth here and as a rule doesn't bear until late. It is not very\r\nproductive and the nuts spoil easily. I have since planted much seed\r\nfrom the south and it often doesn't even get here in a viable condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Assistance from Beltsville+\r\n\r\nMy work has lately been facilitated by Mr. Gravatt and Mr. Clapper. I\r\nvisited them at Beltsville and Mr. Clapper personally toured the orchard\r\nwith me at Glenn Dale, showing me the kind of helpful courtesy that one\r\nnever forgets and that is a tribute to these men.\r\n\r\nSome promising material was given to me which will greatly facilitate my\r\nwork. Mr. Gravatt suggested the use of \"Ammate\" as an experiment to\r\npoison trees that interfere with any American chestnut growth I wish to\r\nsave. The experiment is intended to eliminate the resulting sprouts that\r\naccompany girdling. Incidentally, part of the experiment is to attempt\r\nto give light and cultivation and fertilizer to 100 native chestnut\r\nsprouts in a four acre area.\r\n\r\nI have some information on American chestnut sprouts that may be of\r\ninterest to the membership. In an endeavor to locate the best American\r\nmaterial, I have been combing the woods and thickets on Long Island, in\r\nNew Jersey, Connecticut, and parts of Dutchess County, New York (the\r\nlatter not extensively). Many thousands of sprouts were examined to\r\ndiscover the following:\r\n\r\n_Their present status._\r\n\r\n1. Sprouts occur almost always in woodlands.\r\n\r\n2. They reach their greatest height and are most luxuriant at the edge\r\nof woodlands or in clearings therein.\r\n\r\n3. They rarely exceed 15 feet in height and reach a diameter of about\r\nthree inches.\r\n\r\n4. One in many hundreds, and only where there is light in abundance,\r\nwill bear flowers.\r\n\r\n5. One in many thousands bears female or pistillate flowers which\r\nsometimes produce \"blind\" or empty nuts. [Unpollinated--ED.]\r\n\r\n6. Rarely, indeed very rarely, are two flowering trees close enough to\r\nproduce viable seed.\r\n\r\n7. There are a few seedlings that are single stem upright trees (no old\r\nstump in evidence) that reach up to 20 and rarely 25 or 30 feet in\r\nheight with a diameter of 6\" or so.\r\n\r\n(Mr. R. B. Clapper thinks it is probably due to the absence of an old,\r\ninfected stump that this greater height is reached.)\r\n\r\n8. Ringing by the blight does not necessarily force the flowers and\r\nnuts. The woodlands abound with chestnut sprouts in all stages of\r\ngirdling without pollen or fruit.\r\n\r\nWhen I have my trees in bearing, I will be glad to furnish pollen and\r\nnuts from them to anyone that pursues the important work of trying to\r\nimprove what I consider the most promising nut tree we yet know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Injury to Nut Trees at Ithaca, New York, in the Fall and Winter\r\nof 1947-48\r\n\r\nL. H. MacDANIELS and DAMON BOYNTON, Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1947-48 caused more damage to nut trees at Ithaca, New\r\nYork, than any since 1933-34. It was a combination of a series of early\r\nfreezes followed by sub-zero temperature in mid-winter. Apparently the\r\nmost injury was done by the fall freezes. These occurred on September\r\n25, 26, and 27. On each successive night the temperature dropped lower\r\nthan the preceding, and on September 27 was around 20 deg.F. There was\r\nconsiderable variation in temperature related to exposure, air drainage\r\nconditions, and other factors.\r\n\r\nOn West Hill in Ithaca the minimum temperature recorded on September 27\r\nwas 23 deg.F. Injury to leaves and nuts was severe. Within a few days the\r\nleaves had shrivelled and dried on the trees. It was apparent that this\r\nearly freeze came before the abscission layers were formed in the leaf\r\nbases or growth matured. Ordinarily, a hard freeze late in the season\r\nwill cause the trees to drop the leaves the next day. The nuts on the\r\ntrees were frozen solid and mostly turned black within a few days and\r\nbegan to shrivel. Development was stopped, with the result that the nuts\r\non all varieties were very poorly filled. The cavities appeared on first\r\ncracking to be full of kernel, but on drying these shrunk so that they\r\nwere practically valueless. Some of the nuts were planted in a nursery\r\nrow in the fall and germinated fairly early, showing viable embryos in\r\nspite of arrested development.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the temperature fell to -25 deg.F, a temperature which\r\nordinarily would not damage black walnuts seriously. It is impossible to\r\nseparate the effect of the low winter temperatures from that of the\r\nearly freeze in September. In this location the net result of the early\r\nfreeze and the severe winter was to kill vigorously growing grafts on\r\nthe walnut trees. Also the cambium in the main crotches of a Stambaugh\r\ntree with a trunk about 14 inches in diameter was killed. This tree was\r\ndestroyed in a windstorm in August, 1948, but it is not clear that the\r\nbreakage was related to the winter killing in 1947-48. None of the trees\r\nnow has a good crop, which may be or may not be related to the frost in\r\nthe fall. It is entirely possible that failure to form blossom buds is\r\ncaused either by killing of bud primordia or more likely by depletion of\r\ncarbohydrate reserves due to the loss of leaves in early fall.\r\n\r\nOne seedling of Carpathian walnut was not damaged seriously except for\r\nsome slight terminal twig killing. Another tree, however, had most of\r\nthe smaller branches killed. Hickories and chestnuts were apparently\r\nnot seriously damaged but some seedlings of the Japanese walnut were\r\nkilled to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Walnut and Hickory Plantings+\r\n\r\nAt the orchard of the Department of Pomology of Cornell University there\r\nis a large collection of walnut and hickory varieties and other nut\r\ntrees. It is not known exactly what the temperatures were in this\r\nlocation but an exposed location half a mile distant had a minimum\r\nSeptember temperature recorded of 24 deg.F. and minimum winter temperature\r\nof -20 deg.F. The planting in question is on two levels and on a hillside.\r\nThe damage on the hillside and the upper level was relatively less than\r\non the lowlands where apparently the air drainage was poor. Probably the\r\ntemperature in the lowlands may have reached 20 deg.F. in September and\r\n-25 deg.F. in the winter. At any rate, the damage to the trees was much more\r\nsevere than in the West Hill location where the temperature reached\r\n23 deg.F. in September.\r\n\r\nInjury to the black walnut on the higher land and on the hillside was\r\nmostly the killing back of the twigs and smaller branches. On some\r\ntrees, the petioles of last year's leaves were still attached to the\r\ndead twigs late the following summer, showing that the freeze occurred\r\nbefore the abscission layers had formed. The dozen or more varieties of\r\nblack walnut on the higher land showed little difference between them\r\nexcept that the Elmer Myers showed somewhat greater injury. On the low\r\nground, many varieties including Murphy, Edmunds, Benton, Ohio, Todd,\r\nand Stambaugh were killed to the ground or back to the main branches of\r\nthe trunk. Of three Thomas trees, about 20 years old, one was killed\r\noutright, one severely injured, and the other injured only in the twigs.\r\nApparently the difference in these three trees was related to the size\r\nof the crop on the trees, although no definite data are available on\r\nthis point. Walnuts showing little or no injury were: Mintle and\r\nTasterite. Neither of these had had a crop in 1947.\r\n\r\nMany of the varieties of hickory were injured as was the native\r\nbitternut, _Carya cordiformis_. This injury consisted mostly of the\r\nkilling back of the lower limbs and twigs with some varieties being\r\nkilled outright. Killing of the lower limbs as compared with the tops of\r\nthe trees is probably related to lower temperatures near the ground due\r\nto temperature inversion and possibly to the fact that the lower\r\nbranches were somewhat weaker in their growth. This sort of injury is\r\ncommon with fruit trees.\r\n\r\nOn the higher ground the Chinese chestnut trees planted some 20 years\r\nago showed considerable injury. About 50% of them were killed and others\r\nwere damaged in the lower branches. Chestnut trees in this planting had\r\nall survived the cold winter of 1933-34, with winter temperatures below\r\n-30 deg.F., so that it is probable that the early freeze of September 27 was\r\nresponsible for their death.\r\n\r\nJapanese walnut seedlings again showed great difference in hardiness,\r\nthe more tender seedlings killing to the ground and others showing\r\nlittle damage.\r\n\r\nNorthern pecans on higher ground showed severe damage, the killing\r\nextending to the trunk and larger limbs. The variety Burlington, which\r\nis a hybrid, pecan x shagbark, showed little injury.\r\n\r\nIn a planting of several hundred seedling black walnut trees in another\r\nlocation the temperature on September 27 was probably around 18-20 deg.F.\r\nAbout 20% of the trees were killed to the ground. These trees were\r\ngrowing under a sod mulch, were not overly vigorous, and for the most\r\npart had not come into fruiting.\r\n\r\nIn the 1947-48 winter about half of the sweet cherries in the Pomology\r\norchard were killed and peaches were severely injured. No injury was\r\napparent on apple trees.\r\n\r\nWeather conditions such as occurred in 1947-48, though unusual, are to\r\nbe expected occasionally in the latitude of Ithaca, and in fact\r\nthroughout the northern states. Apparently the fall freeze was\r\nwidespread as it was almost impossible to obtain any black walnuts that\r\nwere of any value. Some of the specimens received from other sources\r\nobviously had been frozen. The possibility of such damage might well be\r\na deterrent on planting black walnuts in any considerable acreage as a\r\ncommercial venture in the north. The experience of the past year\r\ncertainly emphasizes the fact that as yet our knowledge of varieties is\r\nincomplete and also that the Northern Nut Growers Association has much\r\nwork to do in either locating or developing varieties of greater\r\nhardiness or with growth characteristics which provide early maturity\r\nand thus immunity from early frost damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Came Through the Hard Winter in Ontario\r\n\r\nGEORGE HEBDEN CORSAN, Islington, Ontario\r\n\r\n\r\nFor winter killing of trees I refer you to the winter of 1947-48. I had\r\na huge elm and a very tall white ash killed. A lot of black walnuts and\r\nheartnuts and some Persian (English) walnuts were killed back the length\r\nof last year's growth. Some Persian walnuts were killed to the ground\r\nwhile others were not even nipped off of a bud. Very strange to say, my\r\nbest Persian walnut---whose shell is very thin, whose meats are very\r\nsweet and fat, the tree itself a fast grower, prolific and\r\nself-pollenizing--not only did not show a sign of trouble but actually\r\nhad a crop of most excellent nuts. _These trees only_ will I distribute\r\nin future, as well as my two types of \"Rumanian Giants.\" The Rumanian\r\nGiants did show a little winter killing of two or three inches of the\r\ntips and showed up poorly on the crop size.\r\n\r\nI find that all my Russian walnuts [_J. regia_, probably\r\n\"Carpathian\"--Ed.] run true to seed--no bitter nuts as from north China.\r\nThey evidently planted the sweet nuts only, thus eliminating the bitter\r\ntypes; they knew and practiced no budding or grafting in [that part of]\r\nRussia. Astounding to say, filberts came through last winter in\r\nexcellent shape, but the terrible, cold, late spring, froze all male\r\nblossoms but those of the \"Jones Hybrid\" types, which I have from seeds\r\nI sowed. These latter yielded a good crop of nuts as did Brixnut\r\nseedlings.\r\n\r\nNot a butternut on a tree nor a beechnut! Some black walnuts were loaded\r\nwhile others were quite empty.\r\n\r\nAnd so I predicted--last September--a mild, open winter with some cold\r\ndays. [His prediction was good for his locality.--Ed.]\r\n\r\nMy \"Senator Pepper\" hybrid (butternut x heartnut cross) had a crop but\r\nmy \"David Fairchild\" had some empty and some full. My \"Mitchell hybrid\"\r\nhad a good crop and, believe me, this nut is far away ahead of the\r\nMitchell heartnut and up against the world for cracking out clean. It\r\nwill equal an almond, and as for taste, it is so far ahead of a Brazil\r\nnut that the Brazil nut would rank D 3 beside it.\r\n\r\nI still believe in seed planting, even for speed of eventual growth.\r\nLast October I climbed up a black walnut tree I planted in mid-World War\r\nI. From the top of it I looked away down to the tops of electric power\r\npoles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFilberts Grow in Vermont\r\n\r\nJOSEPH N. COLLINS, R.F.D. No. 3, Putney, Vermont\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen years ago I set out a few hundred nut trees and bushes. The\r\nChinese chestnuts are not doing very well, as they needed more attention\r\nthan I could give them. Honeylocusts, in this climate, require more\r\ntime. At present I can report only on seedling filberts. The seeds for\r\nthese plants were collected from the four corners of the world. Some of\r\nthe seedlings perished, lots of them were discarded as unworthy. At\r\npresent I am setting out two acres of the ones that stood up well under\r\nthe test.\r\n\r\nThe filbert (_Corylus avellana_) is a bush 15 to 20 feet tall and the\r\nbushes should be planted 20 to 25 feet apart. It doesn't mind partial\r\nshade, requires no spraying and very little pruning. Like the red\r\nraspberry, it is easily propagated by suckers. Most of my bushes started\r\nproducing when they were four years old and now in their fourteenth\r\nyear, drop about 15 pounds of large fine nuts each September. They stand\r\nup well under the rigorous Vermont climate, at an elevation of 1,000\r\nfeet. Knowing as much about their growing habits as I do, I believe that\r\na steady winter with plenty of snow on the ground and a late spring that\r\nisn't fickle, is well suited for filbert growing in the Northeast. The\r\nneed for wind protection and good air and water drainage cannot be\r\nover-emphasized.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons why I should advise against growing filberts in\r\ntree fashion--with a single trunk, as they are mostly grown on the West\r\nCoast. The catkins of the filbert develop during the summer, lie dormant\r\nthrough the winter, and shed their pollen very early in the spring.\r\nShould the temperature fall as low as -35 deg.F, the catkins winterkill. To\r\novercome this shortcoming, I bend down and peg to the ground, in the\r\nlate fall, a few slim shoots with dormant catkins, so that the snow, or\r\nsome other mulching material supplied when there is insufficient snow,\r\nwill cover and protect the catkins from winterkilling.\r\n\r\nBy the end of March, after a stretch of fair weather, two tiny red\r\ntongues appear at the tips of some of the leaf buds. These are the\r\npollen catching parts of the pistillate flowers. If the winter was kind,\r\nthe filbert bushes will be a riot of golden catkins, shedding their\r\npollen. If the catkins remain dormant when the pistillate flowers bloom,\r\nthey have been winterkilled, and the bent down reserves have to be\r\ncalled up. These being protected during the winter, on being bent back\r\nto their original position, will come into bloom in a few days,\r\npollenizing the waiting pistillate flowers. Bees eagerly seek this, one\r\nof the earliest pollens. The now fertilized flowers, which always stayed\r\ninside the buds, go back to sleep for about two months; they are safe\r\nfrom the \"North Easter,\" from late freezes, or from snow. When filberts\r\nare grown naturally, that is with many shoots from the ground, it is\r\neasy to harvest them by shaking the slender shoots. I hand hoed my\r\nbushes for the first three years, and gave them a permanent mulch over\r\nthe whole area, adding some material each year.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that part of my success with filberts is due to\r\nmulching. In the middle of summer, I apply a 4\" cover of low grade hay,\r\nand in the fall I again cover the ground with fallen leaves. Due to the\r\nideal conditions thus created (optimum temperature and moisture) for\r\nsoil bacteria and earthworms, this material is entirely digested. The\r\nmulching material almost disappears by the middle of the next summer,\r\nindicating vigorous biological activity. By this time a new layer of\r\nmulch is spread, completing the cycle. Late in the fall a load of manure\r\nis heaped in the middle of the plantation as an earthworm refuge. This\r\nheap is scattered early in the spring. Light applications of wood ashes\r\nand super-phosphate are given yearly, late in the fall.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that selected varieties of filbert nuts\r\ncan be grown in the Northeast. Hybrids between the American and European\r\nfilbert are good growers and producers, although I find that the flavor\r\nof the nut isn't as good as that of the pure _avellana_. I would advise\r\nthe planting of a dozen bushes by each of a great number of persons\r\nfurther to prove the possibilities of growing this specific nut in the\r\nNew England area, also to promote the idea of growing both feed and food\r\non trees and bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of Necrology Committee\r\n\r\nC. E. SCHUSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl E. Schuster, horticulturist with the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture stationed on the Oregon State College campus and generally\r\nrecognized as the nation's foremost authority on filbert production,\r\ndied February 6, 1948, in Corvallis as a result of a heart attack. At\r\nthe time of his death, he was 58.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the Northwest's growing nut industry for more than 30\r\nyears, he was recognized for his outstanding contributions to filbert\r\nand walnut production. One of his first and most outstanding\r\ndevelopments was related to the pollination requirements of filbert\r\ntrees. After research proved the common commercial filbert variety, the\r\nBarcelona, was self-sterile, he recommended to filbert growers that they\r\nplant DuChilly, Daviana and White Aveline filbert trees with their\r\nBarcelona to insure complete pollination. Full crops resulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Organized Summer Tours+\r\n\r\nFor approximately 20 years prior to 1941, he served as\r\nsecretary-treasurer of the Western Nut Growers Association. In this\r\ncapacity he assisted in starting the summer tours which have been\r\ncarried on continuously since. He helped guide the Association through\r\nits early years to a position of importance among the commodity groups\r\nof the state. In 1941, he was forced to relinquish his office as a\r\nresult of the enactment of a federal regulation. At this time, he was\r\ngiven an honorary life membership in the Association.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, he devoted major attention to orchard management with\r\nemphasis on fertilization and general nutrition needs of nut trees. In\r\nthis work he co-operated with Dr. R. E. Stephenson at Oregon State\r\nCollege. Their outstanding development was in the field Of boron\r\ndeficiency in walnuts.\r\n\r\nWalnut production of many orchards, they discovered, could be increased\r\ntwo and three fold by the addition of borax fertilizer. The presence of\r\n\"snake heads\" or sprouts in summer walnut growth and \"die-back\" or\r\nwinter kill noticeable in some walnut trees during the winter months are\r\nnow generally recognized as signs of boron deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Wrote Many Nut Articles+\r\n\r\nOther work in walnuts proved that fertilizer applications can and do\r\npay. Prior to this work with resulting fertilizer recommendations, many\r\nwalnut growers had not made heavy enough applications on certain soil\r\ntypes and felt that fertilizers were not worthwhile in walnut\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nMr. Schuster was the author of many articles pertaining to nut culture.\r\n\r\nIn the 10 years he was on the staff of the college horticulture\r\ndepartment before entering federal service, he made an outstanding\r\nrecord in teaching and research. With other scientists he worked in\r\ndeveloping a successful pollination program for cherries. This work was\r\ncarried on after it was determined that the three leading cherry\r\nvarieties, Royal Ann, Bing, and Lambert, were all self-sterile and\r\nintersterile.\r\n\r\nA native of Ohio, he came to Oregon in 1912 to attend Oregon State\r\nCollege after having completed two years at Ohio Wesleyan. He received a\r\nB.S. degree in agriculture in 1914 and two years later, 1916, received\r\nhis master's degree.\r\n\r\nHe joined the college staff three years later and remained until 1929,\r\nwhen he took the federal position he held until his death. He was a\r\nveteran of World War I, having served as an infantry second lieutenant.\r\nHe was a member of Alpha Zeta Sigma Xi, and Gamma Sigma Delta honor\r\nsocieties and was a life-long member of the Evangelical church, which\r\nhas since merged with the United Brethren church.\r\n\r\nHe is survived by Mrs. Schuster and four children, Charles, Robert and\r\nMargaret--all Oregon State College students, and Flora, a high school\r\nstudent. A brother, Dr. Earl J, Schuster, lives at Tillamook.--Reprinted\r\nfrom _Better Fruit_ magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. LAURA SELDEN ELLWANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Laura Selden Ellwanger, member of one of Rochester's pioneer\r\nfamilies, died at her home, 510 East Avenue, Rochester, New York on\r\nSeptember 1, 1948, after a short illness.\r\n\r\nShe was the widow of William D. Ellwanger, whose father, George\r\nEllwanger, was a co-founder of the Ellwanger & Barry Nursery Company.\r\n\r\nHer brother, George B. Selden, was inventor of the gasoline automobile,\r\nand her father, Henry R. Selden, was a New York State Court of Appeals\r\njudge and one-time lieutenant governor of the state.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellwanger was the last survivor of 12 children in the Selden\r\nfamily. Her maternal grandfather, Dr. Abel Baldwin, settled in Clarkson\r\nin 1811, just a year before Rochester was founded. She was born in a\r\nhouse on the land now occupied by the Highland Hospital. One of her\r\nsisters, Louise, was the wife of Maj. Gen. Elwell C. Otis, former\r\ngovernor of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellwanger spent many summers at her home, Brookwood, in Ontario,\r\nWayne County.\r\n\r\nShe was honorary president of the Rochester Female Charitable Society,\r\none of the city's oldest organizations, and a member of the Rochester\r\nHistorical Society, The Rochester Garden Club, Genesee Valley Club, and\r\nthe Rochester Rose Society.\r\n\r\nShe is survived by a daughter, Mrs. Kenneth H. Field, of Rochester; two\r\ngranddaughters, Mrs. John F. Weis, Jr., of New York City, and Mrs. Edwin\r\nII, Atwood, Jr., Rochester, and four great-grandchildren.\r\n\r\n(The above, is from a Rochester newspaper clipping.--Ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. M.

The prospective tree planter is advised to place more reliance on\r\nthe local recommendations (where available) than on those from distant\r\nstates where the soils, the climate, and the adapted varieties may be\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\nThe NNGA list of some nurseries which sell hardy, named varieties of nut\r\ntrees is revised each winter. The secretary, will send copies of the\r\nnext revision free on request.--J. C. McDaniel, _Sec'y._, Nashville 3,\r\nTenn.",
