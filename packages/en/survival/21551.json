In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books, many of which are\r\namong the very best of English literature, and some of which are still\r\nin print.\r\n\r\nMarryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his\r\nstories.  He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day's work, he\r\nnever knew what he was going to write.  He certainly was a literary\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n\"The Little Savage\" was published in 1848, the twenty-sixth book to flow\r\nfrom Marryat's pen.  It was completed after his death by a member of his\r\nfamily.  It is intended for children, and its religious overtones are in\r\ncontrast to Marryat's other works.  He was far from irreligious, but\r\nthis book is definitely in a different style.\r\n\r\nThis e-book was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson, and was reformatted\r\nin 2003, and again in 2005.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE SAVAGE, BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nI am about to write a very curious history, as the reader will agree\r\nwith me when he has read this book.  We have more than one narrative of\r\npeople being cast away upon desolate islands, and being left to their\r\nown resources, and no works are perhaps read with more interest; but I\r\nbelieve I am the first instance of a boy being left alone upon an\r\nuninhabited island.  Such was, however, the case; and now I shall tell\r\nmy own story.\r\n\r\nMy first recollections are, that I was in company with a man upon this\r\nisland, and that we walked often along the sea-shore.  It was rocky and\r\ndifficult to climb in many parts, and the man used to drag or pull me\r\nover the dangerous places.  He was very unkind to me, which may appear\r\nstrange, as I was the only companion that he had; but he was of a morose\r\nand gloomy disposition.  He would sit down squatted in the corner of our\r\ncabin, and sometimes not speak for hours,--or he would remain the whole\r\nday looking out at the sea, as if watching for something, but what I\r\nnever could tell; for if I spoke, he would not reply; and if near to\r\nhim, I was sure to receive a cuff or a heavy blow.  I should imagine\r\nthat I was about five years old at the time that I first recollect\r\nclearly what passed.  I may have been younger.  I may as well here state\r\nwhat I gathered from him at different times, relative to our being left\r\nupon this desolate spot.  It was with difficulty that I did so; for,\r\ngenerally speaking, he would throw a stone at me if I asked questions,\r\nthat is, if I repeatedly asked them after he had refused to answer.  It\r\nwas on one occasion, when he was lying sick, that I gained the\r\ninformation, and that only by refusing to attend him or bring him food\r\nand water.  He would be very angry, and say, that when he got well\r\nagain, he would make me smart for it; but I cared not, for I was then\r\ngetting strong, whilst he was getting weaker every day, and I had no\r\nlove for him, for he had never shown any to me, but always treated me\r\nwith great severity.\r\n\r\nHe told me, that about twelve years before (not that I knew what he\r\nmeant by a year, for I had never heard the term used by him), an English\r\nship (I did not know what a ship was) had been swamped near the island\r\nin a heavy gale, and that seven men and one woman had been saved, and\r\nall the other people lost.  That the ship had been broken into pieces,\r\nand that they had saved nothing--that they had picked up among the rocks\r\npieces of the wood with which it had been made, and had built the cabin\r\nin which we lived.  That one had died after another, and had been buried\r\n(what death or burial meant, I had no idea at the time); and that I had\r\nbeen born on the island--(how was I born? thought I); that most of them\r\nhad died before I was two years old; and that then, he and my mother\r\nwere the only two left besides me.  My mother had died a few months\r\nafterwards.  I was obliged to ask him many questions to understand all\r\nthis; indeed, I did not understand it till long afterwards, although I\r\nhad an idea of what he would say.  Had I been left with any other\r\nperson, I should, of course, by conversation, have learned much; but he\r\nnever would converse, still less explain.  He called me, Boy, and I\r\ncalled him, Master.  His inveterate silence was the occasion of my\r\nlanguage being composed of very few words; for, except to order me to do\r\nthis or that, to procure what was required, he never would converse.  He\r\ndid, however, mutter to himself, and talk in his sleep, and I used to\r\nlie awake and listen, that I might gain information; not at first, but\r\nwhen I grew older.  He used to cry out in his sleep constantly: \"A\r\njudgment, a judgment on me for my sins, my heavy sins!  God be\r\nmerciful!\"  But what judgement, or what sin was, or what was God, I did\r\nnot then know, although I mused on words repeated so often.\r\n\r\nI will now describe the island, and the way in which we lived.  The\r\nisland was very small, perhaps not three miles round; it was of rock,\r\nand there was no beach nor landing-place, the sea washing its sides with\r\ndeep water.  It was, as I afterwards discovered, one of the group of\r\nislands, to which the Peruvians despatch vessels every year to collect\r\nthe guano, or refuse of the sea-birds which resort to the islands; but\r\nthe one on which we were was small, and detached some distance from the\r\nothers, on which the guano was found in great profusion; so that\r\nhitherto it had been neglected, and no vessel had ever come near it.\r\nIndeed, the other islands were not to be seen from it except on a very\r\nclear day, when they appeared like a cloud or mist on the horizon.  The\r\nshores of the island were, moreover, so precipitous, that there was no\r\nlanding-place, and the eternal wash of the ocean would have made it\r\nalmost impossible for a vessel to have taken off a cargo.  Such was the\r\nisland upon which I found myself in company with this man.  Our cabin\r\nwas built of ship-plank and timber, under the shelter of a cliff, about\r\nfifty yards from the water; there was a flat of about thirty yards\r\nsquare in front of it, and from the cliff there trickled down a rill of\r\nwater, which fell into a hole dug out to collect it, and then found its\r\nway over the flat to the rocks beneath.  The cabin itself was large, and\r\ncapable of holding many more people than had ever lived in it; but it\r\nwas not too large, as we had to secure in it our provisions for many\r\nmonths.  There were several bed-places level with the floor, which were\r\nrendered soft enough to lie on, by being filled with the feathers of\r\nbirds.  Furniture there was none, except two or three old axes, blunted\r\nwith long use, a tin pannikin, a mess kid, and some rude vessels to hold\r\nwater, cut out of wood.  On the summit of the island, there was a forest\r\nof underwood, and the bushes extended some distance down the ravines\r\nwhich led from the summit to the shore.  One of my most arduous tasks\r\nwas to climb these ravines and collect wood, but fortunately a fire was\r\nnot often required.  The climate was warm all the year round, and there\r\nseldom was a fall of rain; when it did fall, it was generally expended\r\non the summit of the island, and did not reach us.  At a certain period\r\nof the year, the birds came to the island in numberless quantities to\r\nbreed, and their chief resort was some tolerably level ground--indeed,\r\nin many places, it was quite level with the accumulation of guano--which\r\nground was divided from the spot where our cabin was built by a deep\r\nravine.  On this spot, which might perhaps contain about twenty acres or\r\nmore, the sea-birds would sit upon their eggs, not four inches apart\r\nfrom each other, and the whole surface of this twenty acres would be\r\ncompletely covered with them.  There they would remain, from the time of\r\nthe laying of the eggs, until the young ones were able to leave the\r\nnests and fly away with them.  At the season when the birds were on the\r\nisland, all was gaiety, bustle; and noise, but after their departure it\r\nwas quiet and solitude.  I used to long for their arrival, and was\r\ndelighted with the animation which gladdened the island, the male birds\r\ndiving in every direction after fish, wheeling and soaring in the air,\r\nand uttering loud cries, which were responded to by their mates on the\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nBut it was also our harvest time; we seldom touched the old birds, as\r\nthey were not in flesh, but as soon as the young ones were within a few\r\ndays of leaving the nests, we were then busy enough.  In spite of the\r\nscreaming and the flapping of their wings in our faces, and the darting\r\ntheir beaks at our eyes, of the old birds, as we robbed them of their\r\nprogeny, we collected hundreds every day, and bore as heavy a load as we\r\ncould carry across the ravine to the platform in front of our cabin,\r\nwhere we busied ourselves in skinning them, splitting them, and hanging\r\nthem out to dry in the sun.  The air of the island was so pure that no\r\nputrefaction ever took place, and during the last fortnight of the birds\r\ncoming on the island, we had collected a sufficiency for our support\r\nuntil their return on the following year.  As soon as they were quite\r\ndry they were packed up in a corner of the cabin for use.\r\n\r\nThese birds were, it may be said, the only produce of the island, with\r\nthe exception of fish, and the eggs taken at the time of their first\r\nmaking their nests.  Fish were to be taken in large quantities.  It was\r\nsufficient to put a line over the rocks, and it had hardly time to go\r\ndown a fathom before anything at the end of it was seized.  Indeed, our\r\nmeans of taking them were as simple as their voracity was great.  Our\r\nlines were composed of the sinews of the legs of the man-of-war birds,\r\nas I afterwards heard them named; and, as these were only about a foot\r\nlong, it required a great many of them knotted together to make a line.\r\nAt the end of the line was a bait fixed over a strong fish-bone, which\r\nwas fastened to the line by the middle; a half-hitch of the line round\r\none end kept the bone on a parallel with the line until the bait was\r\nseized, when the line being tautened, the half-hitch slipped off and the\r\nbone remained crossways in the gullet of the fish, which was drawn up by\r\nit.  Simple as this contrivance was, it answered as well as the best\r\nhook, of which I had never seen one at that time.  The fish were so\r\nstrong and large, that, when I was young, the man would not allow me to\r\nattempt to catch them, lest they should pull me into the water; but, as\r\nI grew bigger I could master them.  Such was our food from one year's\r\nend to the other; we had no variety, except when occasionally we broiled\r\nthe dried birds or the fish upon the embers, instead of eating them\r\ndried by the sun.  Our raiment, such as it was, we were also indebted to\r\nthe feathered tribe for.  The birds were skinned with the feathers on,\r\nand their skins sewn together with sinews, and a fish-bone by way of a\r\nneedle.  These garments were not very durable, but the climate was so\r\nfine that we did not suffer from the cold at any season of the year.  I\r\nused to make myself a new dress every year when the birds came; but by\r\nthe time that they returned, I had little left of my last year's suit,\r\nthe fragments of which might be found among the rocky and steep parts of\r\nthe ravine where we used to collect firing.\r\n\r\nLiving such a life, with so few wants, and those periodically and easily\r\nsupplied, hardly varied from one year's end to another, it may easily be\r\nimagined that I had but few ideas.  I might have had more, if my\r\ncompanion had not been of such a taciturn and morose habit; as it was, I\r\nlooked at the wide ocean, and the sky, and the sun, moon, and stars,\r\nwondering, puzzled, afraid to ask questions, and ending all by sleeping\r\naway a large portion of my existence.  We had no tools except the old\r\nones, which were useless--no employment of any kind.  There was a book,\r\nand I asked what it was for and what it was, but I got no answer.  It\r\nremained upon the shelf, for if I looked at it I was ordered away, and\r\nat last I regarded it with a sort of fear, as if it were a kind of\r\nincomprehensible animal.  The day was passed in idleness and almost\r\nsilence; perhaps not a dozen sentences were exchanged in the twenty-four\r\nhours; my companion always the same, brooding over something which\r\nappeared ever to occupy his thoughts, and angry if roused up from his\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nThe reader must understand that the foregoing remarks are to be\r\nconsidered as referring to my position and amount of knowledge when I\r\nwas seven or eight years old.  My master, as I called him, was a short\r\nsquare-built man, about sixty years of age, as I afterwards estimated\r\nfrom recollection and comparison.  His hair fell down his back in thick\r\nclusters and was still of a dark colour, and his beard was full two feet\r\nlong and very bushy; indeed, he was covered with hair, wherever his\r\nperson was exposed.  He was, I should say, very powerful had he had\r\noccasion to exert his strength, but with the exception of the time at\r\nwhich we collected the birds, and occasionally going up the ravine to\r\nbring down faggots of wood, he seldom moved out of the cabin, unless it\r\nwas to bathe.  There was a pool of salt-water of about twenty yards\r\nsquare, near the sea, but separated from it by a low ridge of rocks,\r\nover which the waves only beat when the sea was rough and the wind on\r\nthat side of the island.  Every morning almost we went down to bathe in\r\nthat pool, as it was secure from the sharks, which were very numerous.\r\nI could swim like a fish as early as I can recollect, but whether I was\r\ntaught, or learned myself, I cannot tell.  Thus was my life passed away;\r\nmy duties were trifling; I had little or nothing to employ myself about,\r\nfor I had no means of employment.  I seldom heard the human voice, and\r\nbecame as taciturn as my companion.  My amusements were equally\r\nconfined--looking down into the depths of the ocean, as I lay over the\r\nrocky wall which girted the major portion of the island, and watching\r\nthe motions of the finny tribes below, wondering at the stars, during\r\nthe night season, eating, and sleeping.  Thus did I pass away an\r\nexistence without pleasure and without pain.  As for what my thoughts\r\nwere I can hardly say, my knowledge and my ideas were too confined for\r\nme to have any food for thought.  I was little better than a beast of\r\nthe field, who lies down on the pasture after he is filled.  There was\r\none great source of interest, however, which was to listen to the\r\nsleeping talk of my companion, and I always looked forward to the time\r\nwhen the night fell and we repaired to our beds.  I would lie awake for\r\nhours, listening to his ejaculations and murmured speech, trying in vain\r\nto find out some meaning in what he would say--but I gained little; he\r\ntalked of \"that woman\"--appearing to be constantly with other men, and\r\nmuttering about something he had hidden away.  One night, when the moon\r\nwas shining bright, he sat up in his bed, which, as I have before said,\r\nwas on the floor of the cabin, and throwing aside the feathers upon\r\nwhich he had been lying, scratched the mould away below them and lifted\r\nup a piece of board.  After a minute he replaced everything, and lay\r\ndown again.  He evidently was sleeping during the whole time.  Here, at\r\nlast, was something to feed my thoughts with.  I had heard him say in\r\nhis sleep that he had hidden something--this must be the hiding-place.\r\nWhat was it?  Perhaps I ought here to observe that my feelings towards\r\nthis man were those of positive dislike, if not hatred; I never had\r\nreceived one kind word or deed from him, that I could recollect.  Harsh\r\nand unfeeling towards me, evidently looking upon me with ill-will, and\r\nonly suffering me because I saved him some trouble, and perhaps because\r\nhe wished to have a living thing for his companion, his feelings towards\r\nme were reciprocated by mine towards him.  What age I was at the time my\r\nmother died, I know not, but I had some faint recollection of one who\r\ntreated me with kindness and caresses, and these recollections became\r\nmore forcible in my dreams, when I saw a figure very different from that\r\nof my companion (a female figure) hanging over me or leading me by the\r\nhand.  How I used to try to continue those dreams, by closing my eyes\r\nagain after I had woke up!  And yet I knew not that they had been\r\nbrought about by the dim recollection of my infancy; I knew not that the\r\nfigure that appeared to me was the shadow of my mother; but I loved the\r\ndreams because I was treated kindly in them.\r\n\r\nBut a change took place by the hand of Providence.  One day, after we\r\nhad just laid in our yearly provision of sea-birds, I was busy arranging\r\nthe skins of the old birds, on the flat rock, for my annual garment,\r\nwhich was joined together something like a sack, with holes for the head\r\nand arms to pass through; when, as I looked to seaward, I saw a large\r\nwhite object on the water.\r\n\r\n\"Look, master,\" said I, pointing towards it.\r\n\r\n\"A ship, a ship!\" cried my companion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" thought I, \"that is a ship; I recollect that he said they came\r\nhere in a ship.\"  I kept my eyes on her, and she rounded to.\r\n\r\n\"Is she alive?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fool,\" said the man; \"come and help me to pile up this wood,\r\nthat we may make a signal to her.  Go and fetch some water and throw on\r\nit, that there may be plenty of smoke.  Thank God, I may leave this\r\ncursed hole at last!\"\r\n\r\nI hardly understood him, but I went for the water and brought it in the\r\nmess kid.\r\n\r\n\"I want more wood yet,\" said he.  \"Her head is this way, and she will\r\ncome nearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she is alive,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Away, fool!\" said he, giving me a cuff on the head; \"get some more\r\nwater and throw on the wood.\"\r\n\r\nHe then went into the cabin to strike a light, which he obtained by a\r\npiece of iron and flint, with some fine dry moss for tinder.  While he\r\nwas so employed, my eyes were fixed on the vessel, wondering what it\r\ncould be.  It moved through the water, turned this way and that.  \"It\r\nmust be alive,\" thought I; \"is it a fish or a bird?\"  As I watched the\r\nvessel, the sun was going down, and there was not more than an hour's\r\ndaylight.  The wind was very light and variable, which accounted for the\r\nvessel so often altering her course.  My companion came out with his\r\nhands full of smoking tinder, and putting it under the wood, was busy\r\nblowing it into a flame.  The wood was soon set fire to, and the smoke\r\nascended several feet into the air.\r\n\r\n\"They'll see that,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What then, it has eyes?  It must be alive.  Does it mind the wind?\"\r\ninquired I, having no answer to my first remark, \"for look there, the\r\nlittle clouds are coming up fast,\" and I pointed to the horizon, where\r\nsome small clouds were rising up, and which were, as I knew from\r\nexperience and constantly watching the sky, a sign of a short but\r\nviolent gale, or tornado, of which we usually had one, if not two, at\r\nthis season of the year.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; confound it,\" replied my companion, grinding his teeth, \"it will\r\nblow her off!  That's my luck.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the smoke ascended in the air and the vessel approached\r\nnearer and nearer, until she was within, I suppose, two miles of the\r\nisland, and then it fell quite calm.  My companion threw more water on\r\nto increase the smoke, and the vessel now hauling up her courses, I\r\nperceived that there were people on board, and while I was arranging my\r\nideas as to what the vessel might be, my companion cried out--\"They see\r\nus, they see us!  There's hope now.  Confound it, I've been here long\r\nenough.  Hurrah for old England!\" and he commenced dancing and capering\r\nabout like a madman.  At last he said:\r\n\r\n\"Look out, and see if she sends a boat, while I go into the cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a boat?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Out, you fool!  Tell me if you see anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do see something,\" replied I.  \"Look at the squall coming along\r\nthe water, it will be here very soon; and see how thick the clouds are\r\ngetting up: we shall have as much wind and rain as we had the time\r\nbefore last, when the birds came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound it,\" replied he, \"I wish they'd lower a boat, at all events;\"\r\nand so saying, he went into the cabin, and I perceived that he was busy\r\nat his bed-place.\r\n\r\nMy eyes were still fixed upon the squall, as I watched it advancing at a\r\nfurious speed on the surface of the water; at first it was a deep black\r\nline on the horizon, but as it approached the vessel, changed to white;\r\nthe surface of the water was still smooth.  The clouds were not more\r\nthan ten degrees above the horizon, although they were thick and opaque\r\nbut at this season of the year, these tornados, as I may call them,\r\nvisited us; sometimes we had one, sometimes more, and it was only when\r\nthese gusts came on that we had any rain below.  On board of the\r\nvessel--I speak now from my after knowledge--they did not appear to be\r\naware of the danger the sails were all set and flapping against the\r\nmasts.  At last, I perceived a small object close to the vessel; this I\r\npresumed was the boat which my companion looked for.  It was like a\r\nyoung vessel close to the old one, but I said nothing, as I was watching\r\nand wondering what effect the rising wind would have upon her; for the\r\nobservations of my companion had made me feel that it was important.\r\nAfter a time, I perceived that the white sails were disappearing, and\r\nthat the forms of men were very busy, and moving on board, and the boat\r\nwent back to the side of the vessel.  The fact is, they had not\r\nperceived the squall until it was too late, for in another moment\r\nalmost, I saw that the vessel bowed down to the fury of the gale, and\r\nafter that, the mist was so great that I couldn't see her any more.\r\n\r\n\"Is she sending a boat, boy?\" cried my companion.\r\n\r\n\"I can't see her,\" replied I; \"for she is hidden by the wind.\"\r\n\r\nAs I said this, the tornado reached to where we stood, and threw me off\r\nmy legs to the entrance of the cabin; and with the wind came down a\r\ntorrent of rain, which drenched us, and the clouds covered the whole of\r\nthe firmament, which became dark; the lightning darted in every\r\ndirection, with peals of thunder which were deafening.  I crawled into\r\nthe cabin, into which the rain beat in great fury and flowed out again\r\nin a small river.\r\n\r\nMy companion sat near me, lowering and silent.  For two hours, the\r\ntornado lasted without interruption; the sun had set, and the darkness\r\nwas opaque.  It was impossible to move against the force of the wind and\r\nthe deluge of water which descended.  Speak we did not, but shut our\r\neyes against the lightning, and held our fingers to our ears to deaden\r\nthe noise of the thunder, which burst upon us in the most awful manner.\r\nMy companion groaned at intervals, whether from fear, I know not; I had\r\nno fear, for I did not know the danger, or that there was a God to judge\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nGradually the fury of the gale abated, the rain was only heavy at\r\nintervals, and we could now hear the beating of the waves, as they\r\ndashed against the rocks beneath us.  The sky also cleared up a little,\r\nand we could dimly discern the white foam of the breakers.  I crawled\r\nout of the cabin, and stood upon the platform in front, straining my\r\neyes to see the vessel: A flash of lightning for a second revealed her\r\nto me; she was dismasted, rolling in the awful breakers, which bore her\r\ndown upon the high rocks not a quarter of a mile from her.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" exclaimed I, as the disappearance of the lightning left\r\nme in darkness, more opaque than ever.\r\n\r\n\"She's done for,\" growled my companion, who, I was not till then aware,\r\nstood by my side.  \"No hopes this time, confound it!\"  Then he continued\r\nfor some time to curse and swear awfully, as I afterwards discovered,\r\nfor I did not then know what was cursing and swearing.\r\n\r\n\"There she is again,\" said I, as another flash of lightning revealed the\r\nposition of the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and she won't be there long; in five minutes she'll be dashed to\r\natoms and every soul perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are souls?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\nMy companion gave me no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I will go down to the rocks,\" said I, \"and see what goes on.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" said he, \"and share their fate?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nI left him, and commenced a careful descent of the precipices by which\r\nwe were surrounded, but, before I had gone fifty paces, another flash of\r\nlightning was followed up by a loud shriek, which arrested my steps.\r\nWhere the noise came from I could not tell, but I heard my companion\r\ncalling to me to come back.  I obeyed him, and found him standing where\r\nI had left him.\r\n\r\n\"You called me, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did; take my hand and lead me to the cabin.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed him, wondering why he asked me so to do.  He gained his\r\nbed-place, and threw himself down on it.\r\n\r\n\"Bring the kid full of water,\" said he--\"quick!\"\r\n\r\nI brought it, and he bathed his head and face.  After a time, he threw\r\nhimself back upon the bed-place, and groaned heavily.\r\n\r\n\"O God!  It's all over with me,\" said he at last.  \"I shall live and die\r\nin this cursed hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, master?\" said I.\r\n\r\nHe gave me no answer, but lay groaning and occasionally cursing.  After\r\na time, he was still, and then I went out again.  The tornado was now\r\nover, and the stars were to be seen here and there, but still the wind\r\nwas strong and the wild clouds flew fast.  The shores of the island were\r\none mass of foam, which was dashed high in the air and fell upon the\r\nblack rocks.  I looked for the vessel, and could see nothing--the day\r\nwas evidently dawning, and I sat down and waited its coming.  My\r\ncompanion was apparently asleep, for he lay without motion or noise.\r\nThat some misfortune had happened, I was convinced, but what I knew not,\r\nand I passed a long time in conjecture, dividing my thoughts between him\r\nand the vessel.  At last the daylight appeared--the weather was\r\nmoderating fast, although the waves still beat furiously against the\r\nrocky shore.  I could see nothing of the vessel, and I descended the\r\npath, now slippery and insecure from the heavy fall of rain, and went as\r\nnear to the edge of the rocks as the breaking billows would permit.  I\r\nwalked along, occasionally drenched by the spray, until I arrived where\r\nI had last seen the vessel.  The waves were dashing and tossing about,\r\nas if in sport, fragments of timber, casks, and spars; but that was all\r\nI could see, except a mast and rigging, which lay alongside of the\r\nrocks, sometimes appearing above them on the summit of the waves, then\r\ndescending far out of my sight, for I dared not venture near enough to\r\nthe edge to look over.  \"Then the vessel is dashed to pieces, as my\r\ncompanion said,\" thought I.  \"I wonder how she was made.\"  I remained\r\nabout an hour on the rocks, and then turned back to the cabin.  I found\r\nmy companion awake, and groaning heavily.\r\n\r\n\"There is no ship,\" said I, \"nothing but pieces of wood floating about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" replied he; \"but what do I care now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought by your making a smoke, that you did care.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did then, but now I am blind, I shall never see a ship or\r\nanything else again.  God help me!  I shall die and rot on this cursed\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blind, what is blind?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\n\"The lightning has burned out my eyes, and I can see nothing--I cannot\r\nhelp myself--I cannot walk about--cannot do anything, and I suppose you\r\nwill leave me here to die like a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, all is dark, dark as night, and will be as long as I live.\"  And he\r\nturned on his bed-place and groaned.  \"I had hope, I lived in hope--it\r\nhas kept me alive for many weary years, but now hope is gone, and I care\r\nnot if I die to-morrow.\"  And then he started up and turned his face\r\ntowards me, and I saw that there was no light in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Bring me some more water, do you hear?\" said he angrily.  \"Be quick, or\r\nI'll make you.\"\r\n\r\nBut I now fully comprehended his condition and how powerless he was.  My\r\nfeelings, as I have before said, were anything but cordial towards him,\r\nand this renewed violence and threatening manner had its effect.  I was\r\nnow, I suppose, about twelve or thirteen years old--strong and active.\r\nI had more than once felt inclined to rebel, and measure my strength\r\nagainst his.  Irritated, therefore, at his angry language, I replied--\r\n\r\n\"Go for the water yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed he, after a pause of some seconds, \"that I might have\r\nexpected.  But let me once get you into my hands, I'll make you remember\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care not if I were in your hands,\" replied I; \"I am as strong as\r\nyou.\"  For I had thought so many a day, and meant to prove it.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!  Well, come here, and let us try.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied I, \"I'm not such a fool as you say I am--not that I'm\r\nafraid of you; for I shall have an axe in my hand always ready, and you\r\nwill not find another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I had tossed you over the cliffs when you were a child,\"\r\nsaid he, bitterly, \"instead of nursing you and bringing you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why have you not been kind to me?  As far back as I can remember\r\nyou have always treated me ill; you have made me work for you; and yet\r\nnever even spoken kindly to me.  I have wanted to know things, and you\r\nhave never answered my questions, but called me a fool, and told me to\r\nhold my tongue.  You have made me hate you; and you have often told me\r\nhow you hated me--you know you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's true, quite true,\" replied he, as if talking to himself.  \"I have\r\ndone all that he says, and I have hated him.  But I have had cause.\r\nCome here, boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No;\" replied I, \"do you come here.  You have been master, and I have\r\nbeen boy, long enough.  Now I am master and you are boy, and you shall\r\nfind it so.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I walked out of the cabin and left him.  He cried out,\r\n\"Don't leave me;\" but I heeded him not, and sat down at the edge of the\r\nflat ledge of the rock before the cabin.  Looking at the white dancing\r\nwaves, and deep in my own thoughts, I considered a long while how I\r\nshould behave towards him.  I did not wish him to die, as I knew he must\r\nif I left him.  He could not obtain water from the rill without a great\r\nchance of falling over the cliff.  In fact, I was now fully aware of his\r\nhelpless state; to prove it to myself, I rose and shut my own eyes;\r\ntried if I could venture to move on such dangerous ground, and I felt\r\nsure that I could not.  He was then in my power; he could do nothing; he\r\nmust trust to me for almost everything.  I had said, let what would\r\nfollow, I would be master and he boy; but that could not be, as I must\r\nstill attend upon him, or he would die.  At last the thought came\r\nsuddenly upon me--I will be master, nevertheless, for now he shall\r\nanswer me all my questions, tell me all he knows, or he shall starve.\r\nHe is in my power.  He shall now do what I have ever tried to make him\r\ndo, and he has ever refused.  Having thus arranged my plans, I returned\r\nto the cabin, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Hear what I say--I will be kind to you, and not leave you to starve, if\r\nyou will do what I ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\" replied he.\r\n\r\n\"For a long while I have asked you many questions, and you have refused\r\nto answer them.  Instead of telling me what I would know, you have\r\nbeaten me or thrown stones at me, called me names, and threatened me.  I\r\nnow give you your choice--either you shall promise to answer every\r\nquestion that I put to you, or you may live how you can, for I shall\r\nleave you to help yourself.  If you do as I wish, I will do all I can to\r\nhelp you, but if you will not, thank yourself for what may happen.\r\nRecollect, I am master now; so take your choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied he, slowly, \"it's a judgment upon me, and I must agree\r\nto it.  I will do what you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to begin,\" said I, \"I have often asked you what your name\r\nwas, and what was mine.  I must call you something, and Master I will\r\nnot, for I am master now.  What is your name?\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned, ground his teeth, and then said, \"Edward Jackson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward Jackson!  Very well; and my name?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot bear the name.  I cannot say it,\" replied he angrily.\r\n\r\n\"It it so,\" replied I.  \"Then I leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you bring me some water for my eyes?  They burn,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not, nor anything else, unless you tell me my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank Henniker--and curses on it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank Henniker.  Well, now you shall have the water.\"\r\n\r\nI went out, filled a kid, and put it by his side.\r\n\r\n\"There is the water, Jackson; if you want anything, call me.  I shall be\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have gained the mastery,\" thought I,--\"it will be my turn now.  He\r\ndon't like to answer, but he shall, or he shall starve.  Why does he\r\nfeel so angry at my name?  Henniker!  What is the meaning of Henniker, I\r\nwonder?  I will make him tell me.  Yes, he shall tell me everything.\"  I\r\nmay here observe, that as for pity and compassion, I did not know such\r\nfeelings.  I had been so ill-treated, that I only felt that might was\r\nright; and this right I determined upon exercising to the utmost.  I\r\nfelt an inconceivable pleasure at the idea of my being the master, and\r\nhe the boy.  I felt the love of power, the pride of superiority.  I then\r\nrevolved in my mind the daily task which I would set him before he\r\nshould receive his daily sustenance.  He should talk now as much as I\r\npleased, for I was the master.  I had been treated as a slave, and I was\r\nnow fully prepared to play the tyrant.  Mercy and compassion I knew not.\r\nI had never seen them called forth, and I felt them not.  I sat down on\r\nthe flat rock for some time, and then it occurred to me that I would\r\nturn the course of the water which fell into the hole at the edge of the\r\ncliff; so that if he crawled there, he would not be able to obtain any.\r\nI did so, and emptied the hole.  The water was now only to be obtained\r\nby climbing up, and it was out of his power to obtain a drop.  Food, of\r\ncourse, he could obtain, as the dried birds were all piled up at the\r\nfarther end of the cabin, and I could not well remove them; but what was\r\nfood without water?  I was turning in my mind what should be the first\r\nquestion put to him; and I had decided that I would have a full and\r\nparticular account of how the vessel had been wrecked on the island, and\r\nwho were my father and mother, and why I was named Henniker--when I was\r\nroused by hearing Jackson (as I shall in future call him) crying out,\r\n\"Boy, boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, indeed,\" thought I--\"no longer boy,\" and I gave no reply.\r\n\r\nAgain he called, and at last he cried out \"Henniker,\" but I had been\r\nruffled by his calling me boy, and I would not answer him.  At last he\r\nfairly screamed my name, and then was silent.  After a moment, I\r\nperceived that he crawled out of his bed-place, and feeling by the sides\r\nof the cabin, contrived on his hands and knees to crawl in the direction\r\nof the hole into which the water had previously been received; and I\r\nsmiled at what I knew would be his disappointment when he arrived there.\r\nHe did so at last: put his hand to feel the edge of the hole, and then\r\ndown into it to feel for the water; and when he found that there was\r\nnone, he cursed bitterly, and I laughed at his vexation.  He then felt\r\nall the way down where the water had fallen, and found that the course\r\nof it had been stopped, and he dared not attempt anything further.  He\r\ndashed his clenched hand against the rock.  \"Oh!  That I had him in this\r\ngrasp--if it were but for one moment.  I would not care if I died the\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt you,\" replied I to him, above; \"but you have not got me\r\nin your hands, and you will not.  Go in to bed directly--quick,\" cried\r\nI, throwing a piece of rock at him, which hit him on the head.  \"Crawl\r\nback as fast as you can, you fool, or I'll send another at your head\r\ndirectly.  I'll tame you, as you used to say to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe blow on the head appeared to have confused him; but after a time he\r\ncrawled back to his bed-place, and threw himself down with a heavy\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nI then went down to the water's edge to see if I could find anything\r\nfrom the wreck, for the water was smooth, and no longer washed over the\r\nrocks of the island.  Except fragments of wood, I perceived nothing\r\nuntil I arrived at the pool where we were accustomed to bathe; and I\r\nfound that the sea had thrown into it two articles of large dimensions--\r\none was a cask of the size of a puncheon, which lay in about a foot of\r\nwater farthest from the seaward; and the other was a seaman's chest.\r\nWhat these things were I did not then know, and I wish the reader to\r\nrecollect that a great portion of this narrative is compiled from after\r\nknowledge.  The cask was firm in the sand, and I could not move it.  The\r\nchest was floating; I hauled it on the rocks without difficulty, and\r\nthen proceeded to open it.  It was some time before I could discover\r\nhow, for I had never seen a lock or a hinge in my life; but at last,\r\nfinding that the lid was the only portion of the chest which yielded, I\r\ncontrived, with a piece of rock, to break it open.  I found in it a\r\nquantity of seamen's clothes, upon which I put no value; but some of the\r\narticles I immediately comprehended the use of, and they filled me with\r\ndelight.  There were two new tin pannikins, and those would hold water.\r\nThere were three empty wine-bottles, a hammer, a chisel, gimlet, and\r\nsome other tools, also three or four fishing-lines many fathoms long.\r\nBut what pleased me most were two knives, one shutting up, with a\r\nlanyard sheath to wear round the waist; and the other an American long\r\nknife, in a sheath, which is usually worn by them in the belt.  Now,\r\nthree or four years back, Jackson had the remains of a clasp knife--that\r\nis, there was about an inch of the blade remaining--and this, as may be\r\nsupposed, he valued very much; indeed, miserable as the article was, in\r\nour destitute state it was invaluable.\r\n\r\nThis knife he had laid on the rock when fishing, and it had been dragged\r\ninto the sea as his line ran out; and he was for many days inconsolable\r\nfor its loss.  We had used it for cutting open the birds when we skinned\r\nthem, and, indeed, this remains of a knife had been always in request.\r\nSince the loss of it, we had had hard work to get the skins off the\r\nbirds; I therefore well knew the value of these knives, which I\r\nimmediately secured.  The remainder of the articles in the chest, which\r\nwas quite full, I laid upon the rocks, with the clothes, to dry; of most\r\nof them I did not know the use, and consequently did not prize them at\r\nthe time.  It was not until afterwards, when I had taken them to my\r\ncompanion, that I learned their value.  I may as well here observe, that\r\namongst these articles were two books, and from the positive commands of\r\nmy companion, not to touch the book in the cabin, I looked upon them\r\nwith a degree of awe, and hesitated upon taking them in my hand; but, at\r\nlast, I put them out to dry on the rocks, with the rest of the contents\r\nof the chest.\r\n\r\nI felt the knives, the blades were sharp; I put the lanyard of the clasp\r\nknife round my neck; the sheath knife, which was a formidable weapon, I\r\nmade fast round my waist, with a piece of the fishing-lines, which I cut\r\noff; and I then turned my steps towards the cabin, as night was coming\r\non, though the moon was high in the heavens, and shining brightly.  On\r\nmy return, I found Jackson in his bed-place; he heard me come in, and\r\nasked me in a quiet tone, whether I would bring him some water.  I\r\nanswered--\r\n\r\n\"No, that I would not, for what he had said about me, and what he would\r\ndo if he got me into his power.  I'll tame you,\" cried I.  \"I'm master\r\nnow, as you shall find.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be,\" replied he, quickly, \"but still that is no reason why you\r\nshould not let me have some water.  Did I ever prevent you from having\r\nwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"You never had to fetch it for me,\" I rejoined, \"or you would not have\r\ntaken the trouble.  What trouble would you take for me, if I were blind\r\nnow and not you?  I should become of no use to you, and you would leave\r\nme to die.  You only let me live that you might make me work for you,\r\nand beat me cruelly.  It's my turn now--you're the boy, and I'm the\r\nmaster.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader must remember that I did not know the meaning of the word\r\n\"boy;\" my idea of it was, that it was in opposition to \"master,\" and\r\nboy, with me, had the same idea as the word \"slave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" replied he, calmly.  \"I shall not want water long.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a quietness about Jackson which made me suspect him, and the\r\nconsequence was, that, although I turned into my bed-place, which was on\r\nthe ground at the side of the cabin opposite to his, I did not feel\r\ninclined to go to sleep, but remained awake, thinking of what had\r\npassed.  It was towards morning when I heard him move; my face being\r\nturned that way, I had no occasion to stir to watch his motions.  He\r\ncrept very softly out of his bed-place towards me, listening, and\r\nadvancing on his knees, not more than a foot every ten seconds.  \"You\r\nwant me in your grasp,\" thought I; \"come along,\" and I drew my American\r\nknife from its sheath, without noise, and awaited his approach, smiling\r\nat the surprise he would meet with.  I allowed him to come right up to\r\nme; he felt the side of my bed, and then passed his right hand over to\r\nseize me.  I caught his right hand with my left, and passing the knife\r\nacross his wrist, more than half divided it from his arm.  He gave a\r\nshriek of surprise and pain, and fell back.\r\n\r\n\"He has a knife,\" exclaimed he, with surprise, holding his severed wrist\r\nwith the other hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has a knife, and more than one,\" replied I; \"and you see that\r\nhe knows how to use it.  Will you come again?  Or will you believe that\r\nI am master?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have any charity or mercy, kill me at once,\" said he, as he sat\r\nup in the moonlight, in the centre of the floor of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Charity and mercy,\" said I, \"what are they?  I never heard of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!  No,\" replied he, \"I have showed none--it's a judgment on me--a\r\njudgment on me for my many sins; Lord, forgive me!  First my eyes, now\r\nmy right hand useless.  What next, O Lord of Heaven?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, your other hand next,\" replied I, \"if you try it again.\"\r\n\r\nJackson made no reply.  He attempted to crawl back to his bed, but,\r\nfaint with loss of blood, he dropped senseless on the floor of the\r\ncabin.  I looked at him, and, satisfied that he would make no more\r\nattempts upon me, I turned away, and fell fast asleep.  In about two\r\nhours I awoke, and looking round, perceived him lying on the floor,\r\nwhere he had fallen the night before.  I went to him and examined him--\r\nwas he asleep; or was he dead?  He lay in a pool of blood.  I felt him,\r\nand he was quite warm.  It was a ghastly cut on his wrist, and I\r\nthought, if he is dead, he will never tell me what I want to know.  I\r\nknew that he bound up cuts to stop the blood.  I took some feathers from\r\nthe bed, and put a handful on the wound.  After I had done it, I bound\r\nhis wrist up with a piece of fishing-line I had taken to secure the\r\nsheath knife round my waist, and then I went for some water.  I poured\r\nsome down his throat; this revived him, and he opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" said he, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?--why, in the cabin,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Give me some more water.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, for I did not wish to kill him.  I wanted him to live, and to\r\nbe in my power.  After drinking the water, he roused himself, and\r\ncrawled back to his bed-place.  I left him then, and went down to bathe.\r\n\r\nThe reader may exclaim--What a horrid tyrant this boy is--why, he is as\r\nbad as his companion.  Exactly--I was so; but let the reader reflect\r\nthat I was made so by education.  From the time that I could first\r\nremember, I had been tyrannised over; cuffed, kicked, abused, and\r\nill-treated.  I had never known kindness.  Most truly was the question\r\nput by me, \"Charity and mercy--what are they?\"  I never heard of them.\r\nAn American Indian has kind feelings--he is hospitable and generous--\r\nyet, educated to inflict, and receive, the severest tortures to, and\r\nfrom, his enemies, he does the first with the most savage and vindictive\r\nfeelings, and submits to the latter with indifference and stoicism.  He\r\nhas, indeed, the kindlier feelings of his nature exercised; still, this\r\nchanges him not.  He has been from earliest infancy brought up to\r\ncruelty, and he cannot feel that it is wrong.  Now, my position was\r\nworse.  I had never seen the softer feelings of our nature called into\r\nplay; I knew nothing but tyranny and oppression, hatred and vengeance.\r\nIt was therefore, not surprising that when my turn came, I did to others\r\nas I had been done by.  Jackson had no excuse for his treatment of me,\r\nwhereas I had every excuse for retaliation.  He did know better, I did\r\nnot.  I followed the ways of the world in the petty microcosm in which I\r\nhad been placed.  I knew not of mercy, of forgiveness, charity, or\r\ngood-will.  I knew not that there was a God; I only knew that might was\r\nright, and the most pleasurable sensation which I felt was that of\r\nanxiety for vengeance, combined with the consciousness of power.\r\n\r\nAfter I had bathed, I again examined the chest and its contents.  I\r\nlooked at the books without touching them.  \"I must know what these\r\nmean,\" thought I, \"and I will know.\"  My thirst for knowledge was\r\ncertainly most remarkable, in a boy of my age; I presume for the simple\r\nreason, that we want most what we cannot obtain; and Jackson having\r\ninvariably refused to enlighten me on any subject, I became most anxious\r\nand impatient to satisfy the longing which increased with my growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nFor three days did Jackson lie on his bed; I supplied him with water,\r\nbut he did not eat anything.  He groaned heavily at times, and talked\r\nmuch to himself, and I heard him ask forgiveness of God, and pardon for\r\nhis sins.  I noted this down for an explanation.  On the third day, he\r\nsaid to me:\r\n\r\n\"Henniker, I am very ill.  I have a fever coming on, from the wound you\r\nhave given me.  I do not say that I did not deserve it, for I did, and I\r\nknow that I have treated you ill; and that you must hate me; but the\r\nquestion is, do you wish me to die?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied I, \"I want you to live, and answer all my questions, and\r\nyou shall do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so,\" replied he.  \"I have done wrong, and I will make amends.\r\nDo you understand me?  I mean to say, that I have been very cruel to\r\nyou, and now I will do all you wish, and answer every question you may\r\nput to me, as well as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I want,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"I know it is, but my wound is festering, and must be washed and\r\ndressed.  The feathers make it worse.  Will you do this for me?\"\r\n\r\nI thought a little, and recollected that he was still in my power, as he\r\ncould not obtain water.  I replied, \"Yes, I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cord hurts it, you must take it off.\"\r\n\r\nI fetched the kid of water, and untied the cord, and took away the\r\nfeathers, which had matted together with the flow of blood, and then I\r\nwashed the wound carefully.  Looking into the wound, my desire of\r\ninformation induced me to say, \"What are these little white cords which\r\nare cut through?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the sinews and tendons,\" replied he, \"by which we are enabled\r\nto move our hands and fingers; now these are cut through, I shall not\r\nhave the use of my hand again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment,\" said I, rising up, \"I have just thought of something.\"\r\nI ran down to the point where the chest lay, took a shirt from the rock,\r\nand brought it back with me, and tearing it into strips, I bandaged the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get that linen?\" said Jackson.  I told him.\r\n\r\n\"And you got the knife there, too,\" said he, with a sigh.  I replied in\r\nthe affirmative.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had finished, he told me he was much easier, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is, I thank you?\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"It means that I am grateful for what you have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is grateful?\" inquired I again.  \"You never said those words\r\nto me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no,\" replied he, \"it had been better if I had.  I mean that I\r\nfeel kindly towards you, for having bound up my wound, and would do any\r\nthing for you if I had the power.  It means, that if I had my eyesight,\r\nas I had a week ago, and was master, as I then was, that I would not\r\nkick nor beat you, but be kind to you.  Do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I, \"I think I do; and if you tell me all I want to know,\r\nI shall believe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will as soon as I am well enough; but now I am too ill--you must\r\nwait a day or two, till the fever has left me.\"\r\n\r\nSatisfied with Jackson's promise, I tended him carefully, and washed and\r\ndressed his wound for the two following days.  He said that he felt\r\nhimself much better, and his language to me was so kind and\r\nconciliatory, that I hardly knew what to make of it; but this is\r\ncertain, that it had a good effect upon me, and gradually the hatred and\r\nill-will that I bore to him wore off, and I found myself handling him\r\ntenderly, and anxious not to give him more pain than was necessary, yet\r\nwithout being aware that I was prompted by better feelings.  It was on\r\nthe third morning that he said--\r\n\r\n\"I can talk to you now; what do you want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know the whole story of how we came to this island, who my\r\nfather and mother were, and why you said that you hated me and my name?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Jackson, after a silence of a few minutes, \"will take some\r\ntime.  I could soon tell it you, if it were not for the last question,--\r\nwhy I hated your name?  But the history of your father is so mixed up\r\nwith mine, that I cannot well tell one without the other.  I may as well\r\nbegin with my own history, and that will be telling you both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell it me,\" replied I, \"and do not tell me what is not true.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I will tell you exactly what it was,\" replied Jackson; \"you may as\r\nwell know it as not.--Your father and I were both born in England, which\r\nyou know is your country by birth, and you also know that the language\r\nwe talk is English.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know it.  Tell me something about England before you say any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nI will not trouble the reader with Jackson's description of England, or\r\nthe many questions which I put to him.  It was night-fall before he had\r\nfinished answering, and before I was satisfied with the information\r\nimparted.  I believe that he was very glad to hold his tongue, for he\r\ncomplained of being tired, and I dressed his wound and wetted the\r\nbandage with cold water for him before he went to sleep.\r\n\r\nI can hardly describe to the reader the effect which this uninterrupted\r\nflow of language had upon me; I was excited in a very strange way, and\r\nfor many nights after could not sleep for hours.  I may say here, I did\r\nnot understand a great proportion of the meaning of the words used by\r\nJackson; but I gathered it from the context, as I could not always be\r\ninterrupting him.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how fast ideas breed ideas, and how a word, the\r\nmeaning of which I did not understand when it was first used, became by\r\nrepetition clear and intelligible; not that I always put the right\r\nconstruction on it; but if I did not find it answer when used at another\r\ntime to my former interpretation of it, I would then ask and obtain an\r\nexplanation.  This did not, however, occur very often.  As for this\r\nfirst night, I was positively almost drunk with words, and remained\r\nnearly the whole of it arranging and fixing the new ideas that I had\r\nacquired.  My feelings towards Jackson also were changed--that is, I no\r\nlonger felt hatred or ill-will against him.  These were swallowed up in\r\nthe pleasure which he had afforded me, and I looked upon him as a\r\ntreasure beyond all price,--not but that many old feelings towards him\r\nreturned at intervals, for they were not so easily disposed of; but\r\nstill I would not for the world have lost him until I had obtained from\r\nhim all possible knowledge; and if his wound did not look well when I\r\nremoved the bandage, I was much more distressed than he was.  Indeed,\r\nthere was every prospect of our ultimately being friends, from our\r\nmutual dependence on each other.  It was useless on his part, in his\r\npresent destitute condition, to nourish feelings of animosity against\r\none on whose good offices he was now so wholly dependent, or on my part,\r\nagainst one who was creating for me, I may say, new worlds for\r\nimagination and thought to dwell on.  On the following morning.  Jackson\r\nnarrated in substance (as near as I can recollect) as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I was not intended for a sailor.  I was taught at a good school, and\r\nwhen I was ten years old, I was put into a house of business as a clerk,\r\nwhere I remained at the desk all day long, copying into ledgers and\r\nday-books, in fact, writing what was required of me.  This house was\r\nconnected with the South American trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is South America?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"You had better let me tell my story,\" replied Jackson, \"and after I\r\nhave done, you can ask any questions you like; but if you stop me, it\r\nwill take a week to finish it; yesterday we lost the whole day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very true,\" replied I, \"then I will do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were two other clerks in the counting-house--the head clerk,\r\nwhose name was Manvers, and your father, who was in the counting-house\r\nbut a few months before me.  Our master, whose name was Evelyn, was very\r\nparticular with both your father and myself, scanning our work daily,\r\nand finding fault when we deserved it.  This occasioned a rivalry\r\nbetween us, which made us both very active, and I received praise quite\r\nas often as he did.  On Sunday, Mr Evelyn used to ask your father and\r\nme to spend the day.  We went to church in the forenoon and dined with\r\nhim.  He had a daughter a little younger than we were.  She was your\r\nmother.  Both of us, as we grew up, were very attentive to her, and\r\nanxious to be in her good graces.  I cannot say which was preferred at\r\nfirst, but I rather think that if anything, I was the favourite during\r\nthe first two years of our being acquainted with her.  I was more lively\r\nand a better companion than your father, who was inclined to be grave\r\nand thoughtful.  We had been about four years in the counting-house,\r\nwhen my mother died--my father had been dead some time before I went\r\ninto it--and at her death I found my share of her property to amount to\r\nabout 2,500 pounds.  But I was not yet twenty-one years of age.  I could\r\nnot receive it for another year.  Mr Evelyn, who had till then every\r\nreason to be satisfied with my conduct, used to joke with me, and say\r\nthat as soon as I was of age, he would allow me, if I chose it, to put\r\nthe money in the business, and thus obtain a small share in it--and such\r\nwas my intention, and I looked forward to bright prospects and the hope\r\nof one day being married to your mother; and I have no doubt but such\r\nwould have been the case, had I still conducted myself properly.  But,\r\nbefore I was of age, I made some very bad acquaintances, and soon ran\r\ninto expenses which I could not afford, and the worst was, that I\r\ncontracted a habit of sitting up late at night, and drinking to excess,\r\nwhich I never have since got over, which proved my ruin then, and has\r\nproved my ruin through life.  This little fortune of mine not only gave\r\nme consequence, but was the cause of my thinking very highly of myself.\r\nI now was more particular in my attentions to Miss Evelyn, and was\r\ngraciously received by her father; neither had I any reason to complain\r\nof my treatment from the young lady.  As for your father, he was quite\r\nthrown into the back-ground.  He had no property nor hope of any, except\r\nwhat he might hereafter secure by his diligence and good conduct; and\r\nthe attention I received from Mr Evelyn, and also the head clerk, who\r\nhad an idea that I was to be a partner and consequently would become his\r\nsuperior, made him very melancholy and unhappy, for I believe that then\r\nhe was quite as much in love with Miss Evelyn as I was myself; and I\r\nmust tell you, that my love for her was unbounded, and she well deserved\r\nit.  But all these happy prospects were overthrown by my own folly.  As\r\nsoon as it was known that I had property left to me, I was surrounded by\r\nmany others who requested to be introduced to me, and my evenings were\r\npassed in what I considered very good company, but which proved the very\r\nreverse.  By degrees I took to gambling, and after a time, lost more\r\nmoney than I could afford to pay.  This caused me to have recourse to a\r\nJew, who advanced me loans at a large interest to be repaid at my coming\r\nof age.  Trying to win back my money, I at last found myself indebted to\r\nthe Jew for the sum of nearly 1,000 pounds.  The more that I became\r\ninvolved, the more reckless I became.  Mr Evelyn perceived that I kept\r\nlate hours, and looked haggard, as I well might; indeed, my position had\r\nnow become very awkward.  Mr Evelyn knew well the sum that had been\r\nleft me, and how was I to account to him for the deficiency, if he\r\nproposed that I should put it into the business?  I should be ruined in\r\nhis opinion, and he never, I was convinced, would intrust the happiness\r\nof his daughter to a young man who had been guilty of such\r\nirregularities.  At the same time, my love for her nearly amounted to\r\nadoration.  Never was there a more miserable being than I was for the\r\nlast six months previous to my coming of age; and to drown my misery I\r\nplunged into every excess, and seldom, if ever, went to bed but in a\r\nstate of intoxication.  Scheme after scheme did I propose to enable me\r\nto conceal my fault; but I could hit upon nothing.  The time approached;\r\nI was within a few days of coming of age, when Mr Evelyn sent for me\r\nand then spoke to me seriously, saying, that out of regard to the memory\r\nof my father, with whom he had been very intimate, he was willing to\r\nallow me to embark my little capital in the business, and that he hoped\r\nthat by my good conduct and application I might soon become a useful\r\npartner.  I stammered some reply, which surprised him; and he asked me\r\nto be more explicit.  I stated that I considered my capital too small to\r\nbe of much use in such a business as his, and that I preferred trying\r\nsome quick method of doubling it; that as soon as I had so done I would\r\naccept his offer with gratitude.  `As you please,' replied he coolly;\r\n`but take care, that in risking all, you do not lose all.  Of course,\r\nyou are your own master,' and so saying, he left me, apparently much\r\ndispleased and mortified.  But circumstances occurred, which exposed the\r\nwhole affair.  When in company with my evening companions, I stated my\r\nintentions of trying my fortune in the East Indies, not seriously, but\r\ntalking at random.  This came to the ears of the Jew of whom I had\r\nborrowed the money; he thought that I intended to leave the kingdom,\r\nwithout taking up my bonds, and immediately repaired to Mr Evelyn's\r\ncounting-house, to communicate with the head clerk, and ascertain if the\r\nreport was correct, stating also the sums I was indebted to him.  The\r\nhead clerk informed Mr Evelyn, and on the day upon which I became\r\ntwenty-one years of age, he sent for me into his private room, and,\r\nafter some remonstrances, to which I replied very haughtily, it ended in\r\nmy being dismissed.  The fact was, that Mr Evelyn had, since his last\r\ninterview with me, made inquiries, and finding out I had been living a\r\nvery riotous life, he had determined upon my leaving his service.  As\r\nsoon as my first burst of indignation was over, I felt what I had lost;\r\nmy attachment to Miss Evelyn was stronger than ever, and I bitterly\r\ndeplored my folly; but after a time, as usual, I had recourse to the\r\nbottle, and to drowning my cares in intemperance.  I tried very hard to\r\nobtain an interview with Miss Evelyn previous to my quitting the house,\r\nbut this Mr Evelyn would not permit, and a few days after, sent his\r\ndaughter away, to reside, for a time, with a relation in the country.  I\r\nembarked my capital in the wine-trade, and, could I have restrained\r\nmyself from drinking, should have been successful, and in a short time\r\nmight have doubled my property, as I stated to Mr Evelyn; but now I had\r\nbecome an irreclaimable drunkard; and when that is the case, all hope is\r\nover.  My affairs soon became deranged, and, at the request of my\r\npartner, they were wound up, and I found myself with my capital of 1,500\r\npounds reduced to 1,000 pounds.  With this I resolved to try my fortune\r\nin shipping; I procured a share in a brig, and sailed in her myself.\r\nAfter a time, I was sufficiently expert to take the command of her, and\r\nmight have succeeded, had not my habit of drinking been so confirmed.\r\nWhen at Ceylon, I fell sick, and was left behind.  The brig was lost,\r\nand as I had forgotten to insure my portion of her, I was ruined.  I\r\nstruggled long, but in vain--intemperance was my curse, my bane, the\r\nmillstone at my neck, which dragged me down: I had education, talents,\r\nand energy, and at one time, capital; but all were useless; and thus did\r\nI sink down, from captain of a vessel to mate, from mate to second mate,\r\nuntil I at last found myself a drunken sailor before the mast.  Such is\r\nmy general history; to-morrow I will let you know how, and in what way,\r\nyour father and I met again, and what occurred, up to this present\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was too much bewildered and confused with what he had told me, to\r\nallow him to proceed, as he proposed.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied I.  \"I now recollect all you have said, although I do\r\nnot understand.  You must first answer my questions, as to the meaning\r\nof words I never heard of before.  I cannot understand what money is,\r\nwhat gaming is, and a great many more things you have talked about, but\r\nI recollect, and can repeat every word that you have said.  To-morrow, I\r\nwill recall it all over, and you shall tell me what I cannot make out;\r\nafter that you can go on again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied he, \"I don't care how long it takes me to answer\r\nyour questions, for I am not very anxious to tell all about your father\r\nand myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nI can hardly describe to the reader the effect which these conversations\r\nwith Jackson had upon me at first.  If a prisoner were removed from a\r\ndark cell, and all at once introduced into a garden full of fruit and\r\nflowers, which he never before had an idea were in existence, he could\r\nnot have been more filled with wonder, surprise, and pleasure.  All was\r\nnovelty and excitement, but at the same time, to a great degree, above\r\nmy comprehension.  I had neither language nor ideas to meet it, and yet\r\nI did, to a certain degree, comprehend.  I saw not clearly, but\r\nsometimes as through a mist, at others through a dark fog, and I could\r\ndiscern little.  Every day, however, my increased knowledge of language\r\nand terms gave me an increased knowledge of ideas.  I gained more by\r\ncontext than I did by any other means, and as I was by degrees\r\nenlightened, so my thirst for information and knowledge became every day\r\nmore insatiable.\r\n\r\nThat much that I considered I understood was erroneous, is certain, for\r\nmine was a knowledge, as yet, of theory only.  I could imagine to\r\nmyself, as far as the explanation I received, what such an object might\r\nbe, and, having made up my ideas on the matter, I was content; further\r\nknowledge would, however, incline me to think, and occasionally to\r\ndecide, that the idea I had formed was incorrect, and I would alter it.\r\nThus did I flounder about in a sea of uncertainty, but still of exciting\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIf any one who has been educated, and has used his eyes in a civilised\r\ncountry, reads an account of people and things hitherto unknown to him,\r\nhe can, from the description and from his own general knowledge, form a\r\nvery correct idea of what the country contains.  But then he has used\r\nhis eyes--he has seen those objects between which the parallel or the\r\ndifference has been pointed out.  Now I had not that advantage.  I had\r\nseen nothing but the sea, rocks, and sea-birds, and had but one\r\ncompanion.  Here was my great difficulty, which, I may say, was never\r\nsurmounted, until I had visited and mixed with civilisation and men.\r\nThe difficulty, however, only increased my ardour.  I was naturally of\r\nan ingenious mind, I had a remarkable memory, and every increase of\r\nknowledge was to me a source of delight.  In fact, I had now something\r\nto live for--before I had not; and I verily believe, that if Jackson had\r\nbeen by any chance removed from me at this particular time, I should\r\nsoon have become a lunatic, from the sudden drying up of the well which\r\nsupplied my inordinate thirst for knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome days passed before I asked Jackson to continue his narrative,\r\nduring which we lived in great harmony.  Whether it was that he was\r\ndeceiving me, and commanding his temper till he had an opportunity of\r\nrevenge, or whether it was that his forlorn and helpless condition had\r\nsoftened him down, I could not say; but he appeared gradually to be\r\nforming an attachment to me; I was, however, on my guard at all times.\r\nHis wounded wrist had now healed up, but his hand was quite useless, as\r\nall the tendons had been severed.  I had therefore less to fear from him\r\nthan before.  At my request that he would continue his history, Jackson\r\nrelated as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"After sailing in vessel after vessel, and generally dismissed after the\r\nvoyage for my failing of intemperance, I embarked on board a ship bound\r\nto Chili, and after having been on the coast for nearly a year, we were\r\nabout to proceed home with a cargo, when we anchored at Valdivia,\r\nprevious to our homeward voyage, as we had some few articles to ship at\r\nthat port.  We were again ready for sea, when we heard, from the\r\ncaptain, that he had agreed to take two passengers, a gentleman and his\r\nwife, who wished to proceed to England.  The cabin was cleared out, and\r\nevery preparation made to receive them on board, and in the evening the\r\nboat was sent on shore for the luggage.  I went in the boat, as I\r\nthought it likely that the gentleman would give the boat's crew\r\nsomething to drink; nor was I wrong--he gave us four dollars, which we\r\nspent immediately in one of the ventas, and were all more or less\r\nintoxicated.  It had been arranged that the luggage should first be\r\ncarried on board, and after that, we were to return for the passengers,\r\nas we were to sail early in the morning.  We pulled off with the\r\nluggage, but on our arrival on board, I was so drunk, that the captain\r\nwould not allow me to return in the boat, and I knew nothing of what had\r\npassed until I was roused up the next morning to assist in getting the\r\nship under weigh.  We had been under weigh two or three hours, and were\r\nclearing the land fast, when the gentleman passenger came on deck; I was\r\nthen coiling down a rope on the quarter-deck, and as he passed by me, I\r\nlooked at him, and I recognised him immediately as your father.  Years\r\nhad passed--from a stripling he had grown a man; but his face was not to\r\nbe mistaken.  There he was, apparently a gentleman of property and\r\nconsideration; and I, what was I?  A drunken sailor.  All I hoped was,\r\nthat he would not recognise me.  Shortly afterwards he went down again,\r\nand returned escorting his wife on deck.  Again I took a furtive curious\r\nglance, and perceived at once that she was that Miss Evelyn, whom I had\r\nonce so loved, and by my folly had lost.  This was madness.  As they\r\nstood on the deck, enjoying the cool sea breeze, for the weather was\r\ndelightfully fine, the captain came up and joined them.  I was so\r\nconfused at my discovery, that I knew not what I was about, and I\r\npresume was doing something very awkwardly; for the captain said to\r\nme--`Jackson, what are you about, you drunken hound?  I suppose you are\r\nnot sober yet.'  At the mention of my name, your father and mother\r\nlooked at me, and as I lifted up my head to reply to the captain, they\r\neyed me earnestly, and then spoke to each other in a low tone; after\r\nwhich they interrogated the captain.  I could not hear what they said,\r\nbut I was certain they were talking about me, and that they had\r\nsuspected, if they had not recognised me.  I was ready to sink to the\r\ndeck, and, at the same time, I felt a hatred of your father enter my\r\nheart, of which, during his life, I never could divest myself.  It was\r\nas I supposed; your father had recognised me, and the following morning\r\nhe came up to me as I was leaning over the gunwale amid ships, and\r\naddressed me,--`Jackson,' said he, `I am sorry to find you in this\r\nsituation.  You must have been very unfortunate to have become so\r\nreduced.  If you will confide your history to me, perhaps I may, when we\r\narrive in England, be able to assist you, and it really will give me\r\ngreat pleasure.'  I cannot say that I replied very cordially.  `Mr\r\nHenniker,' said I, `you have been fortunate, by all appearances, and can\r\ntherefore afford compassion to those who have not been so; but, sir, in\r\nour positions, I feel as if pity was in reality a sort of triumph, and\r\nan offer of assistance an insult.  I am content with my present\r\nposition, and will at all events not change it by your interference.  I\r\nearn my bread honestly.  You can do no more.  Times may change yet.\r\nIt's a long road that has no turning to it.  I wish you a good morning.'\r\nSo saying, I turned from him, and walked away forward, with my heart\r\nfull of bitterness and anger.  From that hour he never spoke to me or\r\nnoticed me again; but the captain was more severe upon me, and I\r\nascribed his severity most unjustly to your father.  We were about to go\r\nround Cape Horn, when the gale from the S.E. came on, which ended in the\r\nloss of the vessel.  For several days we strove up against it, but at\r\nlast the vessel, which was old, leaked so much from straining, that we\r\nwere obliged to bear up and run before it, which we did for several\r\ndays, the wind and sea continuing without intermission.  At last we\r\nfound ourselves among these islands, and were compelled occasionally to\r\nhaul to the wind to clear them.  This made her leak more and more, until\r\nat last she became water logged, and we were forced to abandon her in\r\nhaste, during the night, having no time to take anything with us; we\r\nleft three men on board, who were down below.  By the mercy of Heaven we\r\nran the boat into the opening below, which was the only spot where we\r\ncould have landed.  I think I had better stop now, as I have a good deal\r\nto tell you yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do then,\" replied I; \"and now I think of it, I will bring up the chest\r\nand all the things which were in it, and you shall tell me what they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\nI went down and returned with the clothes and linen.  There were eight\r\npair of trousers, nine shirts, besides the one I had torn up to bandage\r\nhis wounds with, two pair of blue trousers, and two jackets, four white\r\nduck frocks, some shoes, and stockings.  Jackson felt them one by one\r\nwith his hands, and told me what they were, and how worn.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you wear some of them?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\n\"If you will give me leave, I will,\" replied he.  \"Let me have a duck\r\nfrock and a pair of trousers.\"\r\n\r\nI handed the articles to him, and then went back for the rest, which I\r\nhad left on the rocks.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, with my arms full, I found that he had put them on, and\r\nhis other clothes were beside him.  \"I feel more like a Christian now,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\n\"A Christian,\" said I, \"what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you by-and-bye.  It is what I have not been for a long,\r\nlong while,\" replied he.  \"Now, what have you brought this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said I, \"what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a roll of duck, to make into frocks and trousers,\" replied he.\r\n\"That is bees'-wax.\"  He then explained to me all the tools,\r\nsailing-needles, fish-hooks, and fishing-lines, some sheets of\r\nwriting-paper, and two pens, I had brought up with me.  \"All these are\r\nvery valuable,\" said he, after a pause, \"and would have added much to\r\nour comfort, if I had not been blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are more things yet,\" said I; \"I will go and fetch them.\"\r\n\r\nThis time I replaced the remaining articles, and brought up the chest.\r\nIt was a heavy load to carry up the rocks, and I was out of breath when\r\nI arrived and set it down on the cabin floor.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have the whole of them,\" said I.  \"Now, what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a spy-glass--but, alas!  I am blind--but I will show you how to\r\nuse it, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are two books,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Give them to me,\" said he, \"and let me feel them.  This one is a Bible,\r\nI am quite sure by its shape, and the other is, I think, a Prayer-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a Bible, and what is a Prayer-book?\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"The Bible is the word of God, and the Prayer-book teaches us how to\r\npray to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is God?  I have often heard you say, `O God!' and `God damn'--\r\nbut who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you to-night, before we go to sleep,\" replied Jackson,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I shall remind you.  I have found a little box inside the\r\nchest, and it is full of all manner of little things--strings and\r\nsinews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me feel them.\"\r\n\r\nI put a bundle into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"These are needles and thread for making and mending clothes--they will\r\nbe useful by-and-bye.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the whole contents of the chest were overhauled and explained.\r\nI could not well comprehend the glass bottles, or how they were made,\r\nbut I put them, with the pannikins, and everything else, very carefully\r\ninto the chest again, and hauled the chest to the further end of the\r\ncabin, out of the way.  Before we went to bed that night, Jackson had to\r\nexplain to me who God was, but as it was only the commencement of\r\nseveral conversations on the subject, I shall not at present trouble the\r\nreader with what passed between us.  Jackson appeared to be very\r\nmelancholy after the conversation we had had on religious matters, and\r\nwas frequently agitated and muttering to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nI did not on the following day ask him to resume his narrative relative\r\nto my father and mother, as I perceived that he avoided it, and I\r\nalready had so far changed, as to have consideration for his feelings.\r\nAnother point had now taken possession of my mind, which was, whether it\r\nwere possible to learn to read those books which I had found in the\r\nchest, and this was the first question that I put to Jackson when we\r\narose on that morning.\r\n\r\n\"How is it possible?\" replied he.  \"Am I not blind--how can I teach\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no way?\" replied I, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Let me think.--Yes, perhaps there is a way--at all events we will try.\r\nYou know which book I told you was the Prayer-book?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!  The small, thin one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--fetch it here.  Now,\" said he, when I put it into his hand, \"tell\r\nme; is there a straight line down the middle of the page of the book, so\r\nthat the words and letters are on both sides of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is,\" replied I; \"in every page, as you call it, there is a\r\nblack line down the middle, and words and letters (I suppose they are)\r\non both sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"And among the letters there are some larger than others, especially at\r\nthe side nearest to the margin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what margin is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean here,\" replied he, pointing to the margin of the page.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I will open the book as near as I can guess at the Morning\r\nService, and you tell me if you can find any part of the writing which\r\nappears to begin with a large round letter, like--what shall I say?--the\r\nbottom of a pannikin.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one on this leaf, quite round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well--now get me a small piece of stick, and make a point to it.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and Jackson swept away a small place on the floor of the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"there are many other prayers which begin with a round\r\nO, as the letter is called; so I must first ascertain if this one is the\r\none I require.  If it is, I know it by heart, and by that shall be able\r\nto teach you all the letters of the alphabet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's an alphabet?\"\r\n\r\n\"The alphabet is the number of letters invented to enable us to read and\r\nwrite.  There are twenty-six of them.  Now look, Frank; is the next\r\nletter to O the shape of this?\" and he drew with the pointed stick the\r\nletter U on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"And the next is like this,\" continued he, drawing the letter R, after\r\nhe had smoothed the ground and effaced the U.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, to make sure, I had better go on, OUR is one word, and then\r\nthere is a little space between; and next you come to an F.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I, looking at what he had drawn, and comparing it with\r\nthe letter in the book.\r\n\r\n\"Then I believe that we are all right, but to make sure, we will go on\r\nfor a little longer.\"\r\n\r\nJackson then completed the word \"Father,\" and \"which art,\" that followed\r\nit, and then he was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"out of that prayer I can teach you all the letters, and\r\nif you pay attention, you will learn to read.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole morning was passed in my telling him the different letters,\r\nand I very soon knew them all.  During the day, the Lord's Prayer was\r\ngone through, and as I learnt the words as well as the letters, I could\r\nrepeat it before night; I read it over to him twenty or thirty times,\r\nspelling every word, letter by letter, until I was perfect.  This was my\r\nfirst lesson.\r\n\r\n\"Why is it called the Lord's Prayer?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Because, when our Lord Jesus Christ was asked by his followers in what\r\nway they ought to address God, he gave them this prayer to repeat, as\r\nbeing the most proper that they could use.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who was Jesus Christ?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was the Son of God, as I told you yesterday, and at the same time\r\nequal with God.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he be equal with God, if, as you said yesterday, God sent him\r\ndown to be killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was with his own consent that he suffered death: but all this is a\r\nmystery which you cannot understand at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a mystery?\"\r\n\r\n\"That which you cannot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not; I only know that such is the fact; but it is above not\r\nonly mine, but all men's comprehension.  But I tell you honestly, that\r\non these points, I am but a bad teacher; I have paid little attention to\r\nthem during my life, and as far as religion is concerned, I can only\r\ngive you the outlines, for I know no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you said that people were to be punished or rewarded when\r\nthey died, according as they had lived a bad or good life; and that to\r\nlive a good life, people must be religious, and obey God's commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did tell you so, and I told you the truth; but I did not tell you\r\nthat I had led a bad life, as I have done, and that I have neglected to\r\npay obedience to God's word and command.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will be punished when you die, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!  I fear so, child,\" replied Jackson, putting his hands up to his\r\nforehead and hiding his face.  \"But there is still time,\" continued he,\r\nafter a pause; and \"O God of mercy!\" exclaimed he, \"how shall I escape?\"\r\n\r\nI was about to continue the conversation, but Jackson requested that I\r\nwould leave him alone for a time.  I went out and sat on the rock,\r\nwatching the stars.\r\n\r\n\"And those,\" he says, \"were all made by God.\"\r\n\r\n\"And God made everything,\" thought I, \"and God lives up beyond those\r\nstars.\"  I thought for a long while, and was much perplexed.  I had\r\nnever heard anything of God till the night before, and what Jackson had\r\ntold me was just enough to make me more anxious and curious; but he\r\nevidently did not like to talk on the subject.  I tried, after a time,\r\nif I could repeat the Lord's Prayer, and I found that I could, so I\r\nknelt down on the rock, and looking up to a bright star, as if I would\r\nimagine it was God, I repeated the Lord's Prayer to it, and then I rose\r\nup and went to bed.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that I had ever prayed.\r\n\r\nI had learnt so much from Jackson, latterly, that I could hardly retain\r\nwhat I had learnt; at all events, I had a very confused recollection in\r\nmy brain, and my thoughts turned from one subject to another, till there\r\nwas, for a time, a perfect chaos; by degrees things unravelled\r\nthemselves, and my ideas became more clear; but still I laboured under\r\nthat half-comprehension of things which, in my position, was\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nBut now my mind was occupied with one leading object and wish, which was\r\nto learn to read.  I thought no more of Jackson's history and the\r\naccount he might give me of my father and mother, and was as willing as\r\nhe was that it should be deferred for a time.  What I required now was\r\nto be able to read the books, and to this object my whole mind and\r\nattention were given.  Three or four hours in the earlier portion of the\r\nday, and the same time in the latter, were dedicated to this pursuit,\r\nand my attention never tired or flagged.  In the course of, I think,\r\nabout six weeks, I could read, without hesitation, almost any portion of\r\nthe Bible or Prayer-book.  I required no more teaching from Jackson, who\r\nnow became an attentive hearer, as I read to him every morning and\r\nevening a portion of the Gospel or Liturgy.  But I cannot say that I\r\nunderstood many portions which I read, and the questions which I put to\r\nJackson puzzled him not a little, and very often he acknowledged that he\r\ncould not answer them.  As I afterwards discovered, this arose from his\r\nown imperfect knowledge of the nature of the Christian religion, which,\r\naccording to his statement to me, might be considered to have been\r\ncomprised in the following sentence: \"If you do good on earth, you will\r\ngo to heaven and be happy; if you do ill, you will go to hell and be\r\ntormented.  Christ came down from heaven to teach us what to do, and how\r\nto follow his example; and all that we read in the Bible we must\r\nbelieve.\"  This may be considered as the creed imparted to me at that\r\ntime.  I believe that Jackson, like many others, knew no better, and\r\ncandidly told me what he himself had been taught to believe.\r\n\r\nBut the season for the return of the birds arrived, and our stock of\r\nprovender was getting low.  I was therefore soon obliged to leave my\r\nbooks, and work hard for Jackson and myself.  As soon as the young birds\r\nwere old enough, I set to my task.  And now I found how valuable were\r\nthe knives which I had obtained from the seaman's chest; indeed, in many\r\npoints I could work much faster.  By tying the neck and sleeves of a\r\nduck frock, I made a bag, which enabled me to carry the birds more\r\nconveniently, and in greater quantities at a time; and with the knives I\r\ncould skin and prepare a bird in one quarter of the time.  With my\r\nfishing-lines also, I could hang up more to dry at one time, so that,\r\nthough without assistance, I had more birds cured in the same time than\r\nwhen Jackson and I were both employed in the labour.  The whole affair,\r\nhowever, occupied me from morning to evening for more than three weeks,\r\nby which time the major portion of my provender was piled up at the back\r\nof the cabin.  I did not, however, lose what I had gained in reading, as\r\nJackson would not let me go away in the morning, or retire to my bed in\r\nthe evening, without my reading to him a portion of the Bible: indeed he\r\nappeared to be quite uncomfortable if I did not do so.\r\n\r\nAt last, the work was ended, and then I felt a strong desire return to\r\nhear that portion of Jackson's history connected with my father and\r\nmother, and I told him so.  He did not appear to be, pleased with my\r\ncommunication, or at all willing to proceed; but as I pressed him hard\r\nand showed some symptoms of resolution and rebellion, he reluctantly\r\nresumed his narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to understand,\" said he, \"that my unwillingness to go on\r\nwith my history proceeds from my being obliged to make known to you the\r\nhatred that subsisted between your father and me; but if you will\r\nrecollect, that we both had, in our early days, been striving to gain\r\nthe same object--I mean your mother--and also that he had taken, as it\r\nwere, what I considered to have been my place, in other points--that he\r\nhad been successful in life, and I had been unfortunate, you must not\r\nthen be surprised at my hating him as I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand nothing about your feelings,\" replied I; \"and why he\r\ninjured you by marrying my mother, I cannot see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I loved her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose you did, I don't know what love is, and therefore cannot\r\nunderstand it, so tell me the story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, when I left off, I told you that we had ventured to land\r\nupon this island, by running the boat into the bathing-pond; but in so\r\ndoing, the boat was beaten to pieces, and was of no use afterwards.  We\r\nlanded, eight persons in all; that is, the captain, your father, the\r\ncarpenter, mate, and three seamen, besides your mother.  We had\r\nliterally nothing in the boat except three axes, two kids, and the two\r\npannikins, which we have indeed now; but as for provisions, or even\r\nwater, we had none of either.  Our first object, therefore, was to\r\nsearch the island to obtain water, and this we soon found at the rill\r\nwhich now runs down by the side of the cabin.  It was very fortunate for\r\nus that we arrived exactly at the time that the birds had come on the\r\nisland and had just laid their eggs; if not, we must have perished with\r\nhunger, for we had not a fish hook with us, or even a fathom of line.\r\n\r\n\"We collected a quantity of eggs, and made a good meal, although we\r\ndevoured them raw.  While we were running about, or rather climbing\r\nabout, over the rocks; to find out what chance of subsistence we might\r\nhave on the island, the captain and your father remained with your\r\nmother, who sat down in a sheltered spot near to the bathing-pool.  On\r\nour return in the evening, the captain called us all together, that he\r\nmight speak to us; and he said, that if we would do well, we must all\r\nact in concert; that it also would be necessary that one should have the\r\ncommand and control of the others; that without such was the case,\r\nnothing would go on well;--and he asked us if we did not consider that\r\nwhat he said was true.  We all agreed, although I, for one, felt little\r\ninclination to do so; but as all the rest said so, I raised no\r\nobjections.  The captain then told us that, as we were all of one\r\nopinion, the next point was to decide as to who should have the command;\r\nhe said, that if it had been on ship-board, he of course would have\r\ntaken it himself, but now we were on shore, he thought that Mr Henniker\r\nwas a much more competent person than he was, and he therefore proposed\r\nthat the command should be given to him, and he, for one, would\r\nwillingly be under his orders.  To this proposal, the carpenter and mate\r\nimmediately agreed, and at last two of the seamen.  I was left alone,\r\nbut I resisted, saying, that I was not going to be ordered about by a\r\nlandsman, and that if I were to obey orders, it must be from a\r\nthorough-bred seaman.  The other two sailors were of my way of thinking,\r\nI was sure, although they had given their consent, and I hoped that they\r\nwould join me, which they appeared very much inclined to do.  Your\r\nfather spoke very coolly, modestly, and prudently.  He pointed out that\r\nhe had no wish to take the command, and that he would cheerfully serve\r\nunder the captain of the vessel, if it would be more satisfactory to all\r\nparties that such should be the case.  But the captain and the others\r\nwere positive, saying that they would not have their choice disputed by\r\nsuch a drunken vagabond as I was, and that if I did not like to remain\r\nwith them, I might go to any part of the island that I chose.  This\r\nconference ended by my getting in a passion, and saying that I would not\r\nbe under your father's orders; and I was seizing one of the axes to go\r\noff with it, when the captain caught my arm and wrested it from me,\r\nstating that the axe was his property, and then telling me that I was\r\nwelcome to go where I pleased.\r\n\r\n\"I left them, therefore, and went away by myself to where the birds were\r\nhatching, as I wished to secure a supply of eggs.  When the night closed\r\nin, I lay down upon the guano, and felt no cold; for the gale was now\r\nover, and the weather was very mild.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning, when I awoke, I found that the sun had been up some\r\ntime.  I looked for the rest of my companions whom I had quitted, and\r\nperceived that they were all busily at work.  The sea was quite calm;\r\nand, when the vessel went down after we left, many articles had floated,\r\nand had been washed to the island.  Some of the men were busy collecting\r\nspars and planks, which were near the rocks, and pushing them along with\r\nthe boat-hooks to the direction of the bathing-pond, where they hauled\r\nthem over the ridge, and secured them.  Your father and mother, with the\r\ncarpenter, were on this ledge where we now are, having selected it as a\r\nproper place for building a shelter, and were apparently very busy.  The\r\ncaptain and one of the seamen were carrying up what spars and timber\r\ncould be collected to where your father was standing with the carpenter.\r\nAll appeared to be active, and working into each other's hands; and I\r\nconfess that, as I looked on, I envied them, and wished that I had been\r\nalong with them; but I could not bear the idea of obeying any orders\r\ngiven by your father; and this alone prevented my joining them, and\r\nmaking my excuses for what I had done and said the previous night.  I\r\ntherefore swallowed some more bird's eggs raw, and sat down in the sun,\r\nlooking at them as they worked.\r\n\r\n\"I soon perceived that the carpenter had commenced operations.  The\r\nframe of this cabin was, with the assistance of your father, before it\r\nwas noon, quite complete and put up; and then they all went down to the\r\nbathing-place, where the boat was lying with her bottom beaten out.\r\nThey commenced taking her to pieces and saving all the nails; the other\r\nmen carried up the portions of the boat as they were ripped off, to\r\nwhere the frame of the cabin had been raised.  I saw your mother go up\r\nwith a load in her hand, which I believed to be the nails taken from the\r\nboat.  In a couple of hours the boat was in pieces and carried up, and\r\nthen your father and most of the men went up to assist the carpenter.  I\r\nhardly need tell what they did, as you have the cabin before you.  The\r\nroof, you see, is mostly built out of the timbers of the boat; and the\r\nlower part out of heavier wood; and a very good job they made of it.\r\nBefore the morning closed in, one of the sides of the cabin was\r\nfinished; and I saw them light a fire with the chips that had been cut\r\noff with the axes, and they then dressed the eggs and birds which they\r\nhad collected the first day.\r\n\r\n\"There was one thing which I had quite forgotten when I mutinied and\r\nleft my companions, which was, the necessity of water to drink; and I\r\nnow perceived that they had taken possession of the spot where the only\r\nwater had as yet been found.  I was suffering very much from thirst\r\ntowards the close of the day, and I set off up the ravine to ascertain\r\nif there was none to be found in that direction.  Before night I\r\nsucceeded in finding some, as you know, for you have often drunk from\r\nthe spring when you have gone up for firewood.  This gave me great\r\nencouragement, for I was afraid that the want of water would have driven\r\nme to submission.  By way of bravado, I tore off; and cut with my knife,\r\nas many boughs of the underwood on the ravine as I well could carry, and\r\nthe next morning I built a sort of wigwam for myself on the guano, to\r\nshow them that I had a house over my head as well as they had; but I\r\nbuilt it further up to the edge of the cliff, above the guano plain, so\r\nthat I need not have any communication with those who I knew would come\r\nfor eggs and birds for their daily sustenance.\r\n\r\n\"Before the night of the following day set in, the cabin was quite\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\"The weather became warmer every day, and I found it very fatiguing to\r\nhave to climb the ravine two or three times a day to procure a drink of\r\nwater, for I had nothing to hold water in, and I thought that it would\r\nbe better that I should take up my quarters in the ravine, and build\r\nmyself a wigwam among the brushwood close to the water, instead of\r\nhaving to make so many journeys for so necessary an article.  I knew\r\nthat I could carry eggs in my hat and pocket-handkerchief sufficient for\r\ntwo or three days at one trip; so I determined that I would do so; and\r\nthe next morning I went up the ravine, loaded with eggs, to take up my\r\nresidence there.  In a day or two I had built my hut of boughs, and made\r\nit very comfortable.  I returned for a fresh supply of eggs on the third\r\nday, with a basket I had constructed out of young boughs, and which\r\nenabled me to carry a whole week's sustenance.  Then I felt quite\r\nsatisfied, and made up my mind that I would live as a hermit during my\r\nsojourn on the island, however long it might be; for I preferred\r\nanything to obeying the orders of one whom I detested as I did your\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"It soon was evident, however, how well they had done in selecting your\r\nfather as their leader.  They had fancied that the birds would remain on\r\nthe island, and that thus they would always be able to procure a supply.\r\nYour father, who had lived so long in Chili, knew better, and that in a\r\nfew weeks they would quit their nesting-place.  He pointed this out to\r\nthem, showing them what a mercy it was that they had been cast away just\r\nat this time, and how necessary it was to make a provision for the year.\r\nBut this they could not imagine that it was possible to do without salt\r\nto cure the birds with; but he knew how beef was preserved without salt\r\non the continent, and showed them how to dry the birds in the sun.\r\nWhile therefore I was up in the ravine, they were busy collecting and\r\ndrying them in large quantities, and before the time of the birds\r\nleaving they had laid up a sufficient supply.  It was he also that\r\ninvented the fishing-lines out of the sinews of the legs of the birds,\r\nand your mother who knotted them together.  At first, they caught fish\r\nwith some hooks made of nails, but your father showed them the way to\r\ntake them without a hook, as you have learnt from me, and which he had\r\nbeen shown by some of the Indians on the continent.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to your father, they were well prepared when the birds flew away\r\nwith their young ones, while I was destitute.  Previous to the flight, I\r\nhad fared but badly, for the eggs contained the young birds half formed,\r\nand latterly so completely formed that I could not eat them; and as I\r\nhad no fire, and did not understand drying them, I had no alternative\r\nbut eating the young birds raw, which was anything but pleasant.  I\r\nconsoled myself, however, with the idea that your father and mother and\r\nthe rest were faring just as badly as myself, and I looked forward to\r\nthe time when the birds would begin to lay eggs again, when I resolved\r\nto hoard up a much larger supply while they were fresh.  But my schemes\r\nwere all put an end to, for in two days, after a great deal of noise and\r\nflying about in circles, all the birds, young and old, took wing, and\r\nleft me without any means of future subsistence.\r\n\r\n\"This was a horrid discovery, and I was put to my wits' ends.  I\r\nwandered over the guano place, and, after the third day of their\r\ndeparture, was glad to pick up even a dead bird with which to appease my\r\nhunger.  At the same time, I wondered how my former companions got on,\r\nfor I considered that they must be as badly off as I was.  I watched\r\nthem from behind the rocks, but I could perceive no signs of uneasiness.\r\nThere was your mother sitting quietly on the level by the cabin, and\r\nyour father or the captain talking with her.  I perceived, however, that\r\ntwo of the party were employed fishing off the rocks, and I wondered\r\nwhere they got their fishing-lines; and at last I concluded that it was\r\nby catching fish that they supported themselves.  This, however, did not\r\nhelp me--I was starving, and starvation will bring down the pride of any\r\nman.  On the fifth day, I walked down to the rocks, to where one of the\r\nseamen was fishing, and having greeted him, I told him that I was\r\nstarving, and asked for something to eat.\r\n\r\n\"`I cannot help you,' replied he; `I have no power to give anything\r\naway; it is more than I dare do.  You must apply to Mr Henniker, who is\r\nthe governor now.  What a foolish fellow you were to mutiny, as you did;\r\nsee what it has brought you to.'\r\n\r\n\"`Why,' replied I, `if it were not for fishing, you would not be better\r\noff than I am.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh yes we should be; but we have to thank him for that--without him, I\r\ngrant, we should not have been.  We have plenty of provisions, although\r\nwe fish to help them out.'\r\n\r\n\"This puzzled me amazingly, but there was no help for it.  I could\r\nstarve no longer, so up I went to the level where your father was\r\nstanding with the captain, and in a swaggering sort of tone, said that I\r\nhad come back, and wanted to join my comrades.  The captain looked at me\r\nand referred me to your father, who said that he would consult with the\r\nrest when they came to dinner, as without their permission he could do\r\nnothing; and then they both turned away.  In the meantime I was ravenous\r\nwith hunger, and was made more so by perceiving that two large fish were\r\nslowly baking on the embers of the fire, and that your mother was\r\nwatching them.  However, there was no help for it, and I sat down at\r\nsome little distance, anxiously waiting for the return of the rest of\r\nthe party, when my fate would be decided.  My pride was now brought down\r\nso low, that I could have submitted to any terms which might have been\r\ndictated.  In about two hours they were all assembled to dinner, and I\r\nremained envying every morsel that they ate, until the repast was\r\nfinished; when, after some consultation, I was ordered to approach--\r\nwhich I did--and your father addressed me: `Jackson, you deserted us,\r\nwhen you might have been very useful, and when our labour was severe;\r\nnow that we have worked hard, and made ourselves tolerably comfortable,\r\nyou request to join us, and partake with us of the fruits of our labour\r\nand foresight.  You have provided nothing, we have--the consequence is,\r\nthat we are in comparative plenty, while you are starving.  Now I have\r\ntaken the opinion of my companions, and they are all agreed, that as you\r\nhave not assisted when you were wanted, should we now allow you to join\r\nus, you will have to work more than the others to make up an equivalent.\r\nIt is therefore proposed that you shall join us on one condition, which\r\nis, that during the year, till the birds again visit the island, it will\r\nbe your task to go up to the ravine every day, and procure the firewood\r\nwhich is required.  If you choose to accept these terms, you are\r\npermitted to join, always supposing that to all the other rules and\r\nregulations which we have laid down for our guidance, you will be\r\nsubject as well as we are.  These are our terms, and you may decide as\r\nyou think proper.'  I hardly need say, that I gladly accepted them, and\r\nwas still more glad when the remnants of the dinner were placed before\r\nme: I was nearly choked, I devoured with such haste until my appetite\r\nwas appeased.\r\n\r\n\"When this was done, I thought over the conditions which I had accepted,\r\nand my blood boiled at the idea that I was to be in a manner the slave\r\nto the rest, as I should have to work hard every day.  I forgot that it\r\nwas but justice, and that I was only earning my share of the year's\r\nprovisions, which I had not assisted to collect.  My heart was still\r\nmore bitter against your father, and I vowed vengeance if ever I had an\r\nopportunity; but there was no help for it.  Every day I went up with a\r\npiece of cord and an axe, cut a large fagot of wood, and brought it down\r\nto the cabin.  It was hard work, and occupied me from breakfast to\r\ndinner-time, and I had no time to lose if I wanted to be back for\r\ndinner.  The captain always examined the fagot, and ascertained that I\r\nhad brought down a sufficient supply for the day's consumption.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\n\"A year passed away, during which I was thus employed.  At last, the\r\nbirds made their appearance, and after we had laid up our annual\r\nprovision, I was freed from my task, and had only to share the labour\r\nwith others.  It was now a great source of speculation how long we were\r\nlikely to remain on the island; every day did we anxiously look out for\r\na vessel, but we could see none, or if seen, they were too far off from\r\nthe island to permit us to make signals to them.  At last we began to\r\ngive up all hope, and, as hope was abandoned, a settled gloom was\r\nperceptible on most of our faces.  I believe that others would have now\r\nmutinied as well as myself, if they had known what to mutiny about.\r\nYour father and mother were the life and soul of the party, inventing\r\namusements, or narrating a touching story in the evenings, so as to\r\nbeguile the weary time.  Great respect was paid to your mother, which\r\nshe certainly deserved; I seldom approached her; she had taken a decided\r\ndislike to me, arising, I presume, from my behaviour towards her\r\nhusband; for now that I was again on a footing with the others, I was as\r\ninsolent to him as I dared to be, without incurring the penalty attached\r\nto insubordination, and I opposed him as much as I could in every\r\nproposal that he brought forward--but your father kept his temper,\r\nalthough I lost mine but too often.  The first incident which occurred\r\nof any consequence, was the loss of two of the men, who had, with your\r\nfather's permission, taken a week's provisions, with the intention of\r\nmaking a tour round the island, and ascertaining whether any valuable\r\ninformation could be brought back: they were the carpenter and one of\r\nthe seamen.  It appears, that during their return, as they were crossing\r\nthe highest ridge, they, feeling very thirsty, and not finding water,\r\nattempted to refresh themselves by eating some berries which they found\r\non a plant.  These berries proved to be strong poison, and they returned\r\nvery ill.  After languishing a few days, they both died.\r\n\r\n\"This was an event which roused us up, and broke the monotony of our\r\nlife; but it was one which was not very agreeable to dwell upon, and\r\nyet, at the same time, I felt rather pleasure than annoyance at it--I\r\nfelt that I was of more consequence, and many other thoughts entered my\r\nmind which I shall not now dwell upon.  We buried them in the guano,\r\nunder the first high rock, where, indeed, the others were all\r\nsubsequently buried.  Three more months passed away, when the other\r\nseaman was missing.  After a search, his trousers were found at the edge\r\nof the rock.  He had evidently been bathing in the sea, for the day on\r\nwhich he was missed, the water was as smooth as glass.  Whether he had\r\nseen something floating, which he wished to bring to land, or whether he\r\nhad ventured for his own amusement, for he was an excellent swimmer,\r\ncould never be ascertained--any more than whether he had sunk with the\r\ncramp,--or had been taken down by a shark.  He never appeared again, and\r\nhis real fate is a mystery to this day, and must ever remain so.  Thus\r\nwere we reduced to four men--your father, the captain, the mate, and me.\r\nBut you must be tired--I will stop now, and tell you the remainder some\r\nother time.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I was not tired, yet, as Jackson appeared to be so, I made no\r\nobjections to his proposal, and we both went to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile I had read the Bible to Jackson, I had often been puzzled by\r\nnumbers being mentioned, and never could understand what was meant; that\r\nis, I could form no idea of the quantity represented by seventy or\r\nsixty, or whatever it might be.  Jackson's answer was, \"Oh!  It means a\r\ngreat many; I'll explain to you by-and-bye, but we have nothing to count\r\nwith, and as I am blind, I must have something in my hand to teach you.\"\r\nI recollected that at the bathing-pool there were a great many small\r\nshells on the rocks, about the size of a pea; there were live fish in\r\nthem, and they appeared to crawl on the rocks.  I collected a great\r\nquantity of these, and brought them up to the cabin, and requested\r\nJackson would teach me to count.  This he did, until he came to a\r\nthousand, which he said was sufficient.  For many days I continued to\r\ncount up to a hundred, until I was quite perfect, and then Jackson\r\ntaught me addition and subtraction to a certain degree, by making me add\r\nand take away from the shells, and count the accumulation, or the\r\nremainder.  At last, I could remember what I had gained by manipulation,\r\nif I may use the term; but further I could not go, although addition\r\nhad, to a degree, made me master of multiplication, and subtraction gave\r\nme a good idea of division.\r\n\r\nThis was a new delight to me, and occupied me for three or four weeks.\r\nAt last I had, as I thought, learned all that he could teach me in his\r\nblind state, and I threw away the shells, and sighed for something more.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden it occurred to me, that I had never looked into the book\r\nwhich still lay upon the shelf in the cabin, and I saw no reason now\r\nthat I should not; so I mentioned it to Jackson, and asked him why I\r\nmight not have that book?\r\n\r\n\"To be sure you may,\" replied he; \"but you never asked for it, and I\r\nquite forgot it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when I asked you before, you were so particular that I should not\r\nopen it.  What was your reason then?\"\r\n\r\nJackson replied--\"I had no reason except that I then disliked you, and I\r\nthought that looking into the book would give you pleasure.  It belonged\r\nto that poor fellow that was drowned; he had left it in the stern-sheets\r\nof the boat when we were at Valdivia, and had forgotten it, and we found\r\nit there when we landed on the island.  Take it down, it will amuse\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI took down the book, and opened it.  It was, if I recollect right,\r\ncalled \"Mayor's Natural History.\"  At all events, it was a Natural\r\nHistory of Beasts and Birds, with a plate representing each, and a\r\ndescription annexed.  It would be impossible for me to convey to the\r\nreader my astonishment and delight.  I had never seen a picture or\r\ndrawing in my life.  I did not know that such things existed.  I was in\r\nan ecstasy of delight as I turned over the pages, hardly taking\r\nsufficient time to see one object before I hastened on to another.  For\r\ntwo or three hours did I thus turn over leaves, without settling upon\r\nany one animal; at last my pulse beat more regularly, and I commenced\r\nwith the Lion.  But now what a source of amusement, and what a multitude\r\nof questions had to be answered by my companion.  He had to tell me all\r\nabout the countries in which the animals were found; and the description\r\nof the animals, with the anecdotes, were a source of much conversation;\r\nand, what was more, the fore-grounds and back-grounds of the landscapes\r\nwith which the animals were surrounded produced new ideas.  There was a\r\npalm-tree, which I explained to Jackson, and inquired about it.  This\r\nled to more inquiries.  The lion himself occupied him and me for a whole\r\nafternoon, and it was getting dark when I lay down, with my new treasure\r\nby my side.  I had read of the lion in the Scriptures, and now I\r\nrecalled all the passages; and before I slept I thought of the bear\r\nwhich destroyed the children who had mocked Elisha the prophet, and I\r\ndetermined that the first animal I would read about the next morning\r\nshould be the bear.\r\n\r\nI think that this book lasted me nearly two months, during which time,\r\nexcept reading a portion every night and morning to Jackson, the Bible\r\nand Prayer-book were neglected.  Some times I thought that the book\r\ncould not be true; but when I came to the birds, I found those which\r\nfrequented the island so correctly described, that I had no longer any\r\ndoubt on the subject.  Perhaps what interested me most were the plates\r\nin which the barn-door fowls and the peacock were described, as in the\r\nback-ground of the first were a cottage and figures, representing the\r\nrural scenery of England, my own country; and in the second there was a\r\nsplendid mansion, and a carriage and four horses driving up to the door.\r\nIn short, it is impossible to convey to the reader the new ideas which\r\nI received from these slight efforts of the draftsman to give effect to\r\nhis drawing.  The engraving was also a matter of much wonder, and\r\nrequired a great deal of explanation from Jackson.  This book became my\r\ntreasure, and it was not till I had read it through and through, so as\r\nalmost to know it by heart, that at length I returned to my Bible.  All\r\nthis time I had never asked Jackson to go on with his narrative; but now\r\nthat my curiosity was appeased, I made the request.  He appeared, as\r\nbefore, very unwilling; but I was pertinacious, and he was worried into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"There were but four of us left and your mother, and the mate was in a\r\nvery bad state of health; he fretted very much, poor fellow, for he had\r\nleft a young wife in England, and what he appeared to fear most was,\r\nthat she would be married again before he could get home.  It ended in a\r\nconfirmed liver complaint, which carried him off nine months afterwards;\r\nand thus was one more of our companions disposed of.  He died very\r\nquietly, and gave me his sleeve-buttons and watch to deliver to his\r\nwife, if ever I should escape from the island.  I fear there is little\r\nchance of her ever receiving them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" said I, recollecting how I had seen him lift up the\r\nboard under his bed-place.\r\n\r\n\"I have them safe,\" replied Jackson, \"and it necessary, will tell you\r\nwhere to find them.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply satisfied me, and I allowed him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"We buried him in the guano, by the side of the two others, and now we\r\nwere but three.  It was at this time that your mother was confined and\r\nyou were born; that is, about three months after the death of the mate.\r\nWe had just finished laying in our stock of birds for the year when she\r\nwas taken ill, sooner than was expected, and it was supposed that was\r\noccasioned by over-exertion at the time.  However, she got up very well\r\nwithout any medical assistance, and your father was much pleased at\r\nhaving a son, for he had been married five years without any prospect of\r\na family.  I ought to observe, that the loss of our companions, one\r\nafter another, had had the effect of bringing those that remained much\r\ncloser together; I was treated with more kindness by both your father\r\nand mother, and the captain, and I returned it as well as my feelings\r\nwould permit me, for I could not altogether get rid of my animosity to\r\nyour father.  However, we became much more confidential, that is\r\ncertain, and I was now treated as an equal.\r\n\r\n\"Six months passed away and you had become a thriving child, when a\r\nmelancholy occurrence--\" here Jackson covered up his face with his hands\r\nand remained for some time silent.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said I, \"Jackson; I know that they all died somehow or\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" replied he, recovering himself.  \"Well, your father\r\ndisappeared.  He had gone to the rocks to fish, and when I was sent to\r\nbring him home to dinner, he was nowhere to be found.  It was supposed\r\nthat a larger fish than usual had been fast to his line, and that he had\r\nbeen jerked off the rocks into the water, and the sharks had taken him.\r\nIt was a dreadful affair,\" continued Jackson, again covering his face.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied I, \"that any man in his senses would have allowed the\r\nfish to have taken the line rather than have been dragged into the\r\nwater.  I don't think that the supposed manner of his death is at all\r\nsatisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied Jackson; \"his foot may have slipped, who knows?\r\nWe only could guess; the line was gone as well as he, which made us\r\nthink what I said.  Still we searched everywhere, but without hope; and\r\nour search--that is, the captain's and mine, for your poor mother\r\nremained with you in her arms distracted--was the cause of another\r\ndisaster--no less than the death of the captain.  They say misfortunes\r\nnever come single, and surely this was an instance of the truth of the\r\nproverb.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did he die?\" replied I, gravely; for somehow or other I felt doubts\r\nas to the truth of what he was saying.  Jackson did not reply till after\r\na pause, when he said--\r\n\r\n\"He was out with me up the ravine collecting firewood, and he fell over\r\nthe high cliff.  He was so injured that he died in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did I do--what could I do but go back and break the news to your\r\nmother, who was distracted when she heard it; for the captain was her\r\nfriend, and she could not bear me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on, pray,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I did all that I could to make your mother comfortable, as there how\r\nwere but her, you; and I, left on the island.  You were then about three\r\nyears old; but your mother always hated me, and appeared now to hate me\r\nmore and more.  She never recovered the loss of your father, to whom she\r\nwas devotedly attached; she pined away, and after six months she died,\r\nleaving you and me only on the island.  Now you know the whole history,\r\nand pray do not ask me any more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nJackson threw himself back in his bed-place and was silent.  So was I,\r\nfor I was recalling all that he had told me, and my doubts were raised\r\nas to the truth of it.  I did not like his hurrying over the latter\r\nportion of his narrative in the way which he had done.  What he had said\r\nabout my mother was not satisfactory.  I had for some time been\r\ngradually drawing towards him, not only showing, but feeling, for him a\r\ngreat increase of good-will; but suspicion had entered my mind, and I\r\nnow began to feel my former animosity towards him renewed.  A night's\r\nsleep, however, and more reflection, induced me to think that possibly I\r\nwas judging him too harshly, and as I could not afford to quarrel with\r\nhim, our intercourse remained as amicable as before, particularly as he\r\nbecome more and more amiable towards me, and did everything in his power\r\nto interest and amuse me.\r\n\r\nI was one day reading to him the account of a monkey, given in the book\r\nof Natural History, in which it is said that that animal is fond of\r\nspirits and will intoxicate itself, and Jackson was telling me many\r\nanecdotes of monkeys on board of the vessel he had sailed in, when it\r\noccurred to me that I had never thought of mentioning to him, or of\r\nascertaining the contents of the cask which had been thrown into the\r\nbathing-pool with the seaman's chest, and I did so then to Jackson,\r\nwondering at its contents and how they were to be got at.\r\n\r\nJackson entered into the question warmly, explaining to me how and where\r\nto bore holes with a gimlet, and making two spiles for me to stop the\r\nholes with.  As soon as he had done so, curiosity induced me to go down\r\nto the pool where the cask had been lying so long in about a foot and\r\nhalf water.  By Jackson's directions I took a pannikin with me, that I\r\nmight bring him a specimen of the contents of the cask, if they should\r\nprove not to be water.  I soon bored the hole above and below, following\r\nJackson's directions, and the liquor, which poured out in a small stream\r\ninto the pannikin, was of a brown colour and very strong in odour, so\r\nstrong, indeed, as to make me reel as I walked back to the rocks with\r\nthe pannikin full of it.  I then sat down, and after a time tasted it.\r\nI thought I had swallowed fire, for I had taken a good mouthful of it.\r\n\"This cannot be what Jackson called spirits,\" said I.  \"No one can drink\r\nthis--what can it be?\"  Although I had not swallowed more than a\r\ntable-spoonful of it, yet, combined with the fumes of the liquor which I\r\nhad inhaled when drawing it off into the pannikin, the effect was to\r\nmake my head swim, and I lay down on the rock and shut my eyes to\r\nrecover myself.  It ended in my falling asleep for many hours, for it\r\nwas not much after noon when I went to the cask, and it was near sunset\r\nwhen I awoke, with an intense pain, in my head.  It was some time before\r\nI could recollect where I was, or what had passed, but the pannikin full\r\nof liquor by my side first reminded me; and then perceiving how late it\r\nwas, and how long I must have slept, I rose up, and taking the pannikin\r\nin my hand, I hastened to return to the cabin.\r\n\r\nAs I approached, I heard the voice of Jackson, whose hearing, since his\r\nblindness, I had observed, had become peculiarly acute.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"And what has kept you so long?--how you have frightened me.  God\r\nforgive me, but I thought that I was to be left and abandoned to\r\nstarvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you have thought that?\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Because I thought that some way or another you must have been killed,\r\nand then I must have died, of course.  I never was so frightened in my\r\nlife, the idea of dying here all alone--it was terrible.\"\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me at the time, that the alarm was all for himself, for\r\nhe did not say a word about how sorry he should have been at any\r\naccident happening to me, but I made no remark, simply stating what had\r\noccurred, and my conviction that the contents of the cask were not\r\ndrinkable.\r\n\r\n\"Have you brought any with you?\" inquired he, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here it is,\" said I, giving him the pannikin.  He smelt it, and\r\nraised it to his lips--took about a wine-glass full of it, and then draw\r\nhis breath.\r\n\r\n\"This is delightful,\" said he; \"the best of old rum, I never tasted so\r\ngood.  How big did you say that the cask was?\"\r\n\r\nI described it as well as I could.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, then it must be a whole puncheon--that will last a long while.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you mean to say that you really like to drink that stuff?\"\r\ninquired I.\r\n\r\n\"Do I like to drink it?  Yes, it is good for men, but it's death to\r\nlittle boys.  It will kill you.  Don't you get fond of it.  Now promise\r\nme that you will never drink a drop of it.  You must not get fond of it,\r\nor some sad accident will happen to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you need fear my drinking it,\" replied I.  \"I have had\r\none taste, as I told you, and it nearly burnt my mouth.  I shan't touch\r\nit again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" replied Jackson, taking another quantity into his mouth.\r\n\"You are not old enough for it; by-and-bye, when you are as old as I\r\nam, you may drink it, then it will do you good.  Now, I'll go to bed,\r\nit's time for bed.  Bring the pannikin after me and put it by my side.\r\nTake care you don't spill any of it.\"\r\n\r\nJackson crawled to his bed and I followed him with the pannikin, and put\r\nit by his side, as he requested, and I returned to my own resting-place,\r\nwithout, however, having the least inclination to sleep, having slept so\r\nlong during the day.\r\n\r\nAt first Jackson was quiet, but I heard him occasionally applying to the\r\npannikin, which held, I should say, about three half-pints of liquor.\r\nAt last he commenced singing a sea-song; I was much surprised, as I had\r\nnever heard him sing before; but I was also much pleased, as it was the\r\nfirst time that I had ever heard anything like melody, for he had a good\r\nvoice and sang in good tune.  As soon as he had finished, I begged him\r\nto go on.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" replied he, with a gay tone I had never heard from him before.\r\n\"You like songs, do you?  My little chap?  Well, I'll give you plenty of\r\nthem.  'Tis a long while since I have sung, but it's a `poor heart that\r\nnever rejoiceth.'  The time was when no one in company could sing a song\r\nas I could, and so I can again, now that I have something to cheer my\r\nheart.  Yes, here's another for you.  I shall rouse them all out\r\nby-and-bye, as I get the grog in--no fear of that--you find the stuff,\r\nand I'll find songs.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised at first at this unusual mirth; but recollecting what\r\nJackson had told me about his intemperance, I presumed that this mirth\r\nwhich it produced was the cause why he indulged so much in it; and I\r\nfelt less inclined to blame him.  At all events, I was much pleased with\r\nthe songs that he sang to me one after another for three or four hours,\r\nwhen his voice became thick, and, after some muttering and swearing, he\r\nwas quite silent, and soon afterwards snored loudly.  I remained awake\r\nsome time longer, and then I also sank into forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the next morning, I found Jackson still fast asleep.  I\r\nwaited for him for our morning meal; but, as he did not wake, I took\r\nmine by myself, and then I walked out to the rock, where I usually sat,\r\nand looked round the horizon to see if there was anything in sight.  The\r\nspy-glass, from having been in sea-water, was of no use, and I did not\r\nknow what to do with it; nor could Jackson instruct me.  After I had\r\nbeen out about an hour I returned, and found Jackson still snoring, and\r\nI determined to wake him up.  I pushed him for some time without\r\nsuccess; but, at last, he opened his eyes, and said:\r\n\r\n\"My watch already?\"\r\n\r\n\"No;\" said I; \"but you have slept so long, that I have waked you up.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, as if he did not know my voice, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"But I can't see anything; how's this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you know that you're blind, Jackson?\" replied I, with\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I recollect now.  Is there anything in the pannikin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a drop,\" replied I; \"why, you must have drunk it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I recollect now.  Get me some water my good boy; for I am dying\r\nwith thirst.\"\r\n\r\nI went for the water; he drank the whole pannikin, and asked for more.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you have something to eat?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Eat?  Oh no; I can't eat anything.  Give me drink;\" and he held out his\r\nhand for the pannikin.  I perceived how it trembled and shook, and I\r\nobserved it to him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes;\" replied he, \"that's always the case after a carouse, and I had a\r\ngood one last night--the first for many a year.  But there's plenty more\r\nof it.  I wish you would get me a little more now, Frank, just to steady\r\nme; just about two or three mouthfuls, no more; that is, no more till\r\nnight time.  Did I make much noise last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"You sang several songs,\" replied I, \"with which I was much amused.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad that you liked them.  I used to be considered a good singer in\r\nmy day; indeed, if I had not been such good company, as they term it, I\r\nhad not become so fond of drinking.  Just go and fetch me about half an\r\ninch high of the pannikin, my good fellow, that's all I want now.\"\r\n\r\nI went down to the cask, drew off the quantity that he requested, and\r\nbrought it to him.  He drank it off; and, in a few moments, appeared to\r\nbe quite himself again.  He then asked for some thing to eat, and\r\ncommenced telling me a variety of stories relative to what he termed\r\njolly parties in his former days; so that the day passed very agreeably.\r\nAs the night closed in, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank, I know you want to hear some more songs; so go down and\r\nbring me up a full pannikin, and I will sing you plenty.\"\r\n\r\nI complied with his request, for I was anxious to be again amused as I\r\nwas the night before.  The consequence was, that this night was, in the\r\nearly portion of it, but a repetition of the previous one.  Jackson took\r\nthe precaution to get into his bed-place before he commenced drinking;\r\nand, as soon as he had taken his second dose, he asked me what sort of\r\nsongs I liked.  My reply naturally was, that I had never heard any one\r\nsing but him, and therefore could not say.\r\n\r\n\"What did I sing to you last night?\" said he.\r\n\r\nI replied as well as I could.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"they were all sea-songs; but now I will give you\r\nsomething better.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a little thought, he commenced singing a very beautiful and\r\nplaintive one, and certainly much better than he had sung the night\r\nbefore; for he now was sober.  The consequence was, that I was still\r\nmore delighted; and, at my request, he sang several others; but at last\r\nhis speech became rapid and thick, and he would not sing any more, using\r\nsome very coarse expressions to me when I asked him.  For a time he was\r\nsilent, and I thought that he was going to sleep, and I was reflecting\r\nupon the various effects which the liquor appeared to have upon him,\r\nwhen I heard him talking and muttering, and I listened.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind how I got them,\" said he; \"quite as honestly as other\r\npeople, Old Moshes.  There they are, do you choose to buy them?\"  Then\r\nthere was a pause, after which he commenced: \"They're as pure diamonds\r\nas ever came out of a mine.  I know that, so none of your lies, you old\r\nJew.  Where did I come by them?  That's no concern of yours.  The\r\nquestion is, will you give me the price, or will you not?  Well, then,\r\nI'm off.  No, I won't come back, you old thief.\"  Here he swore\r\nterribly, and then was silent.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he recommenced--\r\n\r\n\"Who can ever prove that they were Henniker's diamonds?\"\r\n\r\nI started up at the mention of my father's name; I rested with my hands\r\non the floor of the cabin, breathless as to what would come next.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" continued Jackson, \"he's dead, and food for fishes--dead men\r\ntell no tales--and she's dead, and the captain's dead, all dead--yes,\r\nall;\" and he gave a bitter groan and was silent.\r\n\r\nThe day was breaking, and I could just see him as he lay; but he said no\r\nmore, and appeared to breathe heavily.  As the sun rose, I got out of my\r\nbed-place; and, now that it was broad day light, I looked at Jackson.\r\nHe was lying on his back; his brow was covered with large drops of\r\nperspiration, and his hands were clenched together.  Although asleep, he\r\nappeared, by the convulsive twitching of the muscles of his face, to be\r\nsuffering and in great agony.  Occasionally he groaned deeply, and his\r\nlips appeared to move, but no sound proceeded from them.  I perceived\r\nthat the pannikin of liquor was not finished, one third at least having\r\nbeen left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nI then went out of the cabin and took my usual seat, and began to\r\nreflect upon what I had heard.  He had talked about diamonds; now I knew\r\nwhat diamonds were, so far as they were of great value, for I had read\r\nof them in the Bible, and Jackson had explained the value of precious\r\nstones to me, and had told me of diamonds of very great value indeed.\r\nThen he said that they were Henniker's diamonds--he must have meant my\r\nfather, that was positive.  And that no one could prove they were his--\r\nthis implied that Jackson had no right to them; indeed how could he\r\nhave?  And then I recalled to mind his having a secret hiding-place\r\nunder his bed, where I presumed the diamonds were deposited.  I then\r\nturned over in my mind what he had told me relative to the death of my\r\nfather, the captain, and my mother, how confused he was, and how glad he\r\nwas to get rid of the subject, and how unsatisfactory I thought his\r\naccount was at the time.  After much cogitation, I made up my mind that\r\nJackson had not told me the truth, and that there was a mystery yet to\r\nbe explained but how was I to get at it?  There was but one way.  The\r\nliquor made him talk.  I would supply him with liquor, and by degrees, I\r\nwould get the truth out of him.  At the same time I would not allow him\r\nto suppose that he had said anything to commit himself, or that I had\r\nany suspicions.\r\n\r\nHow naturally do we fall into treachery and deceit, from the evil in our\r\nown hearts, without any assistance or example from the world.  How could\r\nI have learnt deceit?  Isolated as I had been, must it not have been\r\ninnate?\r\n\r\nI returned to the cabin, and woke Jackson without much difficulty, since\r\nhe had not drunk so much as on the previous night.\r\n\r\n\"How are you this morning?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Not very well, I have had some bad dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you sang me some beautiful songs,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I recollect,\" said he; \"but I fell asleep at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you refused to sing any more, and went off in a loud snore.\"\r\n\r\nJackson got out of his bed-place, and I gave him his meal.  We talked\r\nduring the whole day about singing, and I hummed the air which had\r\npleased me most.\r\n\r\n\"You have got the air pretty correct,\" said he; \"you must have an ear\r\nfor music.  Have you ever tried to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never; you know I have not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have tried when I was not with you.  Try now.  I will sing a\r\ntune, and then do you repeat it after me.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so, and I repeated it.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said he.  \"Let's try the compass of your voice.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran up the gamut, and I followed him.\r\n\r\n\"I think you can go higher than I can,\" said he; \"however, you go quite\r\nhigh enough, so now I'll give you a singing lesson.\"\r\n\r\nThus were we occupied at intervals during the whole day, for Jackson\r\nwould not allow me to try my voice too much at first.  As the evening\r\nfell, he again asked me to fetch some liquor, and as I had three quart\r\nwine-bottles, as I before mentioned, which I had found in the chest, I\r\ntook them down to fill, as it would save me many trips, and be more\r\nconvenient in every respect.\r\n\r\nI brought them up full, and Jackson stopped them up with some of the\r\nrags which I had torn to bind round his wrist, and put them all three in\r\nhis bed-place.\r\n\r\n\"That will be a much better arrangement,\" said he, \"as now I can pour\r\nout the liquor into the pannikin as I want it; besides, I mean to take a\r\nlittle water with it in future.  It's not quite so good with water, but\r\nit lasts longer, and one don't go to sleep so soon.  Well, I little\r\nthought that I should have such a comfort sent me after all my\r\nsufferings.  I don't so much care now about staying here.  Go and fetch\r\nsome water in the pannikin.\"\r\n\r\nThat night was a repetition of the first.  Jackson sang till he was\r\nintoxicated, and then fell fast asleep, not talking or saying a word,\r\nand I was disappointed, for I remained awake to catch anything he might\r\nsay.  It would be tedious to repeat what took place for about a month;--\r\nsuffice it to say, it was very rarely, during that time, that Jackson\r\nsaid anything in his sleep, or drunken state, and what he did say, I\r\ncould make nothing of.  He continued in the `daytime' to give me lessons\r\nin singing, and I could now sing several songs very correctly.  At night\r\nhe returned to his usual habit, and was more or less intoxicated before\r\nthe night was over.  I perceived, however, that this excess had a great\r\neffect upon his constitution, and that he had become very pale and\r\nhaggard.  Impatient as I felt to find out the truth, I concealed my\r\nfeelings towards him (which had certainly very much changed again since\r\nthe discovery I had made and the suspicions I had formed), and I\r\nremained on the best of terms with him, resolving to wait patiently.  He\r\nhad spoken once, and therefore I argued that he would speak again; nor\r\nwas I wrong in my calculations.\r\n\r\nOne night, after he had finished his usual allowance of liquor, and had\r\ncomposed himself for sleep, I observed that he was unusually restless,\r\nchanging his position in his bed-place every few minutes, and, at last,\r\nhe muttered, \"Captain James.  Well, what of Captain James, eh?\"\r\n\r\nA thought struck me that he might reply to a question.\r\n\r\n\"How did he die?\" said I, in a low clear voice.\r\n\r\n\"Die?\" replied Jackson, \"he fell down the cliff.  Yes, he did.  You\r\ncan't say I killed him.  No--never put my finger on him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that he was silent for some time, and then he recommenced.\r\n\r\n\"She always said that I destroyed them both, but I did not--only one--\r\nyes, one, I grant--but I hated him--no, not for his diamonds--no, no--if\r\nyou said his wife indeed--love and hate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you killed him for love of his wife, and hate of himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.  Who are you that have guessed that?  Who are you?  I'll\r\nhave your life.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he started up in his bed-place, awakened by his dream,\r\nand probably by my voice, which he had replied to.\r\n\r\n\"Who spoke?\" said he.  \"Frank Henniker, did you speak?\"\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but pretended to be sound asleep, as he still sat up,\r\nas if watching me.  I feigned a snore.\r\n\r\n\"It could not have been him,\" muttered Jackson, \"he's quite fast.\r\nMercy, what a dream!\"\r\n\r\nHe then sank down in his bed-place, and I heard the gurgling noise which\r\ntold me that he had put the bottle of liquor to his mouth, and was\r\ndrinking out of it.  From the time that the gurgling lasted, he must\r\nhave taken a great deal.  At last, all was quiet again.\r\n\r\n\"So I have discovered it at last,\" said I, as my blood boiled at what I\r\nhad heard.  \"He did murder my father.  Shall I kill him while he\r\nsleeps?\" was the first thought that came into my troubled mind.  \"No, I\r\nwon't do that.  What then, shall I tax him with it when he is awake, and\r\nthen kill him?\" but I thought, that, as he was blind, and unable to\r\ndefend himself, it would be cowardly, and I could not do that.  What\r\nthen was I to do?  And as I cooled down, I thought of the words of the\r\nBible, that we were to return good for evil; for Jackson, of whom, when\r\nI read it, I asked why we were told to do so, had explained it to me,\r\nand afterwards when I came to the part which said, \"Vengeance is mine,\r\nsaith the Lord,\" he had told me that there was punishment for the wicked\r\nhereafter, and that was the reason why we were not to obey the Jewish\r\nlaw of \"an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\" which I had\r\nreferred to.  This portion of the Bible he had well explained, and\r\ncertain it is that it prevented my raising my hand against him that\r\nnight.  Still, I remained in a state of great excitement; I felt that it\r\nwould be impossible for me to be any longer on good terms with him, and\r\nI revolved the question in my mind, till, at last, worn out by\r\nexcitement, I fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nA short time before daylight, I started up at what I thought was a faint\r\ncry, but I listened, and hearing nothing more, I again fell asleep, and\r\nit was broad daylight when I arose; my first thoughts were naturally of\r\nJackson, and I looked at where he lay, but he was no longer there--his\r\nbed-place was empty.  I was astonished, and after a moment's thought, I\r\nrecollected the cry I had heard in the night, and I ran out of the cabin\r\nand looked around me; but I could see nothing of him.  I then went to\r\nthe edge of the flat rock upon which the cabin was built and looked over\r\nit; it was about thirty feet from this rock to the one below, and nearly\r\nperpendicular.  I thought that he must have gone out in the night, when\r\nintoxicated with liquor, and have fallen down the precipice; but I did\r\nnot see him as I peered over.  \"He must have gone for water,\" thought I,\r\nand I ran to the corner of the rock, where the precipice was much\r\ndeeper, and looking over, I perceived him lying down below without\r\nmotion or apparent life.  I had, then, judged rightly.  I sat down by\r\nthe side of the pool of water quite overpowered; last night I had been\r\nplanning how I should destroy him, and now he lay dead before me without\r\nmy being guilty of the crime.  \"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,\" were\r\nthe words that first escaped my lips; and I remained many minutes in\r\ndeep thought.  At last it occurred to me that he might not yet be dead;\r\nI ran down the cliff, and, clambering over the rocks, arrived breathless\r\nat the spot where Jackson lay.  He groaned heavily as I stood by him.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson,\" said I, kneeling down by him, \"are you much hurt?\" for all my\r\nfeelings of animosity had vanished when I perceived his unhappy\r\ncondition.  His lips moved, but he did not utter any sound.  At last he\r\nsaid, in a low voice, \"Water.\"  I hastened back as fast as I could to\r\nthe cabin, got a pannikin half full of water, and poured a little rum in\r\nit out of the bottle.  This journey and my return to him occupied some\r\nten minutes.  I put it to his lips, and he seemed to revive.  He was a\r\ndreadful object to look at.  The blood from a cut on his head had poured\r\nover his face and beard, which were clotted with gore.  How to remove\r\nhim to the cabin I knew not.  It would be hardly possible for me to\r\ncarry him over the broken rocks which I had climbed to arrive at where\r\nhe lay; and there was no other way but what was longer, and just as\r\ndifficult.  By degrees he appeared to recover; I gave him more of the\r\ncontents of the pannikin, and at last he could speak, although with\r\ngreat pain and difficulty.  As he did so he put his hand to his side.\r\nHe was indeed a ghastly object, with his sightless eyeballs, his livid\r\nlips, and his face and beard matted with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could get to the cabin, if I helped you?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never get there--let me die where I am,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But the cut on your head is not very deep,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't feel it;--but--my side--I bleed inwardly--I am--broken to\r\npieces,\" said he, pausing and gasping between each word.\r\n\r\nI looked at his side, and perceived that it was already black and much\r\nswollen.  I offered him more drink, which he took eagerly, and I then\r\nreturned for a further supply.  I filled two of the wine-bottles with\r\nwater and a small drop of spirits as before, and went back to where he\r\nlay.  I found him more recovered, and I had hopes that he might still do\r\nwell, and I told him so.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied he; \"I have but a few hours to live--I feel that.  Let\r\nme die here, and die in peace.\"\r\n\r\nHe then sank into a sort of stupor, occasioned, I presume, by what I had\r\ngiven him to drink, and remained quite quiet, and breathing heavily.  I\r\nsat by him waiting till he should rouse up again; for more than an hour\r\nI was in a very confused state of mind, as may well be imagined, after\r\nwhat had passed in the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nWhat I most thought of was obtaining from him, now that he was dying,\r\nthe full truth as to the deaths of my father and mother.\r\n\r\nJackson remained so long in this state of stupor, I feared that he would\r\ndie before I could interrogate him; but this, as it proved, was not to\r\nbe the case.  I waited another hour, very impatiently I must\r\nacknowledge, and then I went to him and asked him how he felt.  He\r\nreplied immediately, and without that difficulty which he appeared\r\nbefore to have experienced.\r\n\r\n\"I am better now--the inward bleeding has stopped; but still I cannot\r\nlive--my side is broken in, I do not think there is a rib that is not\r\nfractured into pieces, and my spine is injured, for I cannot move or\r\nfeel my legs; but I may live many hours yet, and I thank God for his\r\nmercy in allowing me so much time--short indeed to make reparation for\r\nso bad a life; but still nothing is impossible with God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" replied I, \"if you can speak, I wish you would tell me the\r\ntruth relative to my father's death, and also about the death of\r\nothers--as for my father, I know that you murdered him--for you said so\r\nlast night in your sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Jackson replied--\"I am glad that I did, and that you have\r\ntold me so--I wished to make a full confession even to you; for\r\nconfession is a proof of repentance.  I know that you must hate me, and\r\nwill hate my memory, and I cannot be surprised at it; but look at me\r\nnow, Frank, and ask your own heart whether I am not more an object of\r\npity than of hatred.  `Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!' and has not\r\nhis vengeance fallen upon me even in this world?  Look at me; here I am,\r\nseparated from the world that I loved so much, with no chance of ever\r\njoining it--possessed of wealth which would but a few months ago have\r\nmade me happy--now blind, crushed to pieces by an avenging God, in whose\r\npresence I must shortly appear to answer for all my wickedness--all my\r\nexpectations overthrown, all my hopes destroyed, and all my accumulated\r\nsins procuring me nothing, but, it may be, eternal condemnation.  I ask\r\nyou again, am I not an object of pity and commiseration?\"\r\n\r\nI could but assent to this, and he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I will now tell you the truth.  I did tell the truth up to the time of\r\nyour father and mother's embarkation on board of the brig, up to when\r\nthe gale of wind came on which occasioned eventually the loss of the\r\nship.  Now give me a little drink.\r\n\r\n\"The vessel was so tossed by the storm, and the waves broke over her so\r\ncontinually, that the between-decks were full of water, and as the\r\nhatches were kept down, the heat was most oppressive.  When it was not\r\nmy watch, I remained below, and looked out for another berth to sleep\r\nin.  Before the cabin bulkheads on the starboard side, the captain had\r\nfitted up a sort of sail-room to contain the spare sails in case we\r\nshould require them.  It was about eight feet square, and the sails were\r\npiled up in it, so as to reach within two feet of the deck overhead;\r\nthough the lower ones were wetted with the water, above they were dry,\r\nand I took this berth on the top of the sails as my sleeping-place.  Now\r\nthe state-room in which your father and mother slept was on the other\r\nside of the cabin bulkhead, and the straining and rolling of the vessel\r\nhad opened the chinks between the planks, so that I could see a great\r\ndeal of what was done in the state-room, and could hear every word\r\nalmost that was spoken by them.  I was not aware of this when I selected\r\nthis place as my berth, but I found it out on the first night, the light\r\nof the candle shining through the chinks into the darkness by which I\r\nwas surrounded outside.  Of course, it is when a man is alone with his\r\nwife that he talks on confidential subjects; that I knew well, and hoped\r\nby listening to be able to make some discovery;--what, I had no idea of;\r\nbut, with the bad feelings which stimulated me, I determined not to lose\r\nan opportunity.  It was not till about a week after I had selected this\r\nberth, that I made any discovery.  I had had the watch from six to eight\r\no'clock, and had gone to bed early.  About nine o'clock your father came\r\ninto the state-room.  Your mother was already in bed.  As your father\r\nundressed, your mother said, `Does not that belt worry you a great deal,\r\nmy dear?'\r\n\r\n\"`No,' replied your father, `I am used to it now; it did when I first\r\nput it on, but now I have had it on four days, I do not feel it.  I\r\nshall keep it on as long as this weather lasts; there is no saying what\r\nmay happen, and it will not do to be looking for the belt at a moment's\r\nwarning.'\r\n\r\n\"`Do you think then that we are in danger?'\r\n\r\n\"`No, not particularly so, but the storm is very fierce, and the vessel\r\nis old and weak.  We may have fine weather in a day or two, or we may\r\nnot; at all events, when property of value is at stake, and that\r\nproperty not my own, I should feel myself very culpable, if I did not\r\ntake every precaution.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well--I wish we were safe home again, my dear, and that my father had\r\nhis diamonds, but we are in the hands of God.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, I must trust to Him,' replied your father.\r\n\r\n\"This circumstance induced me to look through one of the chinks of the\r\nbulkhead, so that I could see your father, and I perceived that he was\r\nunbuckling a belt which was round his body, and which no doubt contained\r\nthe diamonds referred to.  It was of soft leather, and about eight\r\ninches wide, sewed lengthways and breadthways in small squares, in\r\nwhich, I presumed the diamonds were deposited.  After a time your mother\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\"`I really think, Henniker, that I ought to wear the belt.'\r\n\r\n\"`Why so, my dear?'\r\n\r\n\"`Because it might be the means of my preservation in case of accident.\r\nSuppose, now, we were obliged to abandon the vessel and take to the\r\nboats; a husband, in his hurry, might forget his wife, but he would not\r\nforget his diamonds.  If I wore the belt, you would be certain to put me\r\nin the boat.'\r\n\r\n\"`That observation of yours would have force with some husbands, and\r\nsome wives,' retorted your father; `but as I have a firm belief in the\r\nScriptures, it does not affect me.  What do the Proverbs say?  \"The\r\nprice of a virtuous woman is far above rubies;\" and a good ruby is worth\r\neven more in the market than a diamond of the same size.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, I must comfort myself with that idea,' replied your mother,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"`Supposing we be thrown upon some out-of-the-way place,' said your\r\nfather, `I shall then commit the belt to your charge.  It might soon be\r\ndiscovered on my person, whereas, on yours, it would stand every chance\r\nof being long concealed.  I say this because, even in a desert, it would\r\nbe dangerous to have it known by unscrupulous and unprincipled men that\r\nany one had so much wealth about him.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well,' replied your mother, `that is also comfortable for me to hear,\r\nfor you will not leave me behind, because I shall be necessary to\r\nconceal your treasure.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' replied your father, laughing, `there is another chance for you,\r\nyou see.'\r\n\r\n\"Your father then extinguished the light, and the conversation was not\r\nrenewed; but I had heard enough.  Your father carried a great treasure\r\nabout his person--wealth, I took it for granted, that if I once could\r\nobtain, and return to England, would save me from my present position.\r\nMy avarice was hereby excited, and thus another passion equally\r\npowerful, and equally inciting to evil deeds, was added to the hate\r\nwhich I already had imbibed for your father.  But I must leave off now.\"\r\n\r\nJackson drank a little more, and then remained quiet, and as I had no\r\nfood that day, I took the opportunity of returning to the cabin, with\r\nthe promise that I would be back very soon.  In half an hour I returned,\r\nbringing with me the Bible and Prayer-book, as I thought that he would\r\nask me to read to him after he had made his confession.  I found him\r\nbreathing heavily, and apparently asleep, so I did not wake him.  As I\r\nlooked at him, and recalled to mind his words, \"Am not I an object of\r\npity?\"  I confessed that he was, and then I asked myself the question,\r\nCan you forgive him who was the murderer of your father?  After some\r\nreflection, I thought that I could.  Was he not already punished?  Had\r\nnot the murder been already avenged?  It was not possible to retain\r\nanimosity against one so stricken, so broken to pieces, and my heart\r\nsmote me when I looked at his disabled hand, and felt that I, boy as I\r\nwas, had had a share in his marring.  At last, he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Are you there, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a little sleep,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Do you feel easier?\" inquired I, kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I feel my side more numbed, and so it will remain, till\r\nmortification takes place.  But let me finish my confession, I wish to\r\nrelieve my mind; not that I shall die to-night, or perhaps to-morrow,\r\nbut still, I wish it over.  Come nearer to me, that I may speak in a\r\nlower voice, and then I shall be able to speak longer.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"You know how we were cast upon this island, and how I behaved at first.\r\nWhen I afterwards took my place with the others, my evil thoughts\r\ngradually quitted me, and I gave, up all idea of any injury to your\r\nfather.  But this did not last long.  The deaths of so many, and at last\r\nthe captain, your father, and your mother being the only ones left on\r\nthe island besides myself, once more excited my cupidity.  I thought\r\nagain of the belt of diamonds, and by what means I should gain\r\npossession of it; and the devil suggested to me the murders of the\r\ncaptain and of your father.  I had ascertained that your father no\r\nlonger carried the belt on his person when we all used to bathe at the\r\nbathing-pool; it was, therefore, as your father had proposed, in your\r\nmother's keeping.  Having once made up my mind, I watched every\r\nopportunity to put my intentions into execution.  It was the custom for\r\none of us to fish every morning, as your mother would not eat the dried\r\nbirds, if fish could be procured, and I considered that the only chance\r\nI had of executing my horrible wish was when your father went to fish\r\noff the rocks.  We usually did so off the ledge of rocks which divide\r\nthe bathing-pool from the sea, but I found out another place, where more\r\nfish, and of a better quality, were to be taken, which is off the high\r\nwall of rocks just below.  You know where I mean, I have often sent you\r\nto fish there, but I never could go myself since your father's death.\r\nYour father took his lines there, and was hauling in a large fish, when\r\nI, who had concealed myself close to where he stood, watched the\r\nopportunity as he looked over the rock to see if the fish was clear of\r\nthe water, to come behind him and throw him off into the sea.  He could\r\nnot swim, I knew, and after waiting a minute or two, I looked over and\r\nsaw his body, just as it sank, after his last struggles.  I then\r\nhastened away, and my guilty conscience induced me to ascend the ravine,\r\nand collect a faggot of firewood to bring home, that no suspicions might\r\nbe entertained; but my so doing was the very cause of suspicion, as you\r\nwill afterwards perceive.  I returned with the wood, and the captain\r\nobserved, when I came up to the cabin:--\r\n\r\n\"`Why, it's something new for you to collect wood out of your turn,\r\nJackson.  Wonders will never cease.'\r\n\r\n\"`The fact is, that I am becoming very amiable,' replied I, hardly\r\nknowing what to say, and afraid to look either of them in the face, for\r\nyour mother, with you on her lap, was standing close by.\r\n\r\n\"`Has my husband caught any fish, do you know, Jackson?' said your\r\nmother, `for it is high time that he came home.'\r\n\r\n\"`How can I tell?' replied I.  `I have been up the ravine for wood.'\r\n\r\n\"`But you were down on the rock two hours ago,' replied your mother,\r\n`for Captain James saw you coming away.'\r\n\r\n\"`That I certainly did,' replied the captain.  `Had he caught any fish\r\nwhen you were with him?'\r\n\r\n\"They must have perceived my confusion when I said, `Yes, I was on the\r\nrocks, but I never went near Henniker, that I'll swear.'\r\n\r\n\"`You must have been near him, even when I saw you,' replied the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"`I never looked at him, if I was,' replied I.\r\n\r\n\"`Well then, one of us had better go down and see what he is about,'\r\nsaid the captain.  `Shall I leave Jackson with you?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, yes,' replied your mother, much agitated, `for I have my\r\nforebodings; better leave him here.'\r\n\r\n\"The captain hastened down to the rocks, and in a quarter of an hour\r\nreturned very much heated, saying, `He is not there!'\r\n\r\n\"`Not there?' replied I, getting up, for I had seated myself in silence\r\non the rock during the captain's absence: `that's very odd.'\r\n\r\n\"`It is,' replied the captain.  `Jackson, go and try if you see anything\r\nof him, while I attend to Mrs Henniker.'\r\n\r\n\"Your mother, on the captain's return, had bowed her head down to her\r\nknees, and covered her face with her hands.  I was glad of an excuse to\r\nbe away, for my heart smote me as I witnessed her condition.\r\n\r\n\"I remained away half an hour, and then returned, saying, that I could\r\nsee nothing of your father.\r\n\r\n\"Your mother was in the cabin, and the captain went in to her, while I\r\nremained outside with all the feelings of Cain upon my brow.\r\n\r\n\"That was a dreadful day for all parties--no food was taken.  Your\r\nmother and the captain remained in the cabin, and I dared not, as usual,\r\ngo into my own bed-place.  I lay all night upon the rocks--sleep I could\r\nnot; every moment I saw your father's body sinking, as I had seen it in\r\nthe morning.  The next morning, the captain came out to me.  He was very\r\ngrave and stern, but he could not accuse me, whatever his suspicions\r\nmight have been.  It was a week before I saw your mother again, for I\r\ndared not intrude into her presence; but, finding there was no\r\naccusation against me, I recovered my spirits, and returned to the\r\ncabin, and things went on as before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\n\"One thing, however, was evident, that your mother had an aversion--I\r\nmay say a horror--of me, which she could not conceal.  She said nothing,\r\nbut she never could look at me; and to any question I put, would seldom\r\nmake reply.  Strange to say, this treatment of hers produced quite a\r\ndifferent effect from what might have been anticipated, and I felt my\r\nformer love for her revive.  Her shrinking from me made me more familiar\r\ntowards her, and increased her disgust.  I assumed a jocose air with\r\nher, and at times Captain James considered it his duty to interfere and\r\ncheck me.  He was a very powerful man, and in a contest would have\r\nproved my master; this I knew, and this knowledge compelled me to be\r\nmore respectful to your mother in his presence, but when his back was\r\nturned I became so disgustingly familiar, that at last your mother\r\nrequested that whether fishing or collecting wood, instead of going out\r\nby turns we should both go, and leave her alone.  This I could not well\r\nrefuse, as Captain James would in all probability have used force if I\r\nhad not consented, but my hatred to him was in consequence most\r\nunbounded.  However, an event took place which relieved me from the\r\nsubjection which I was under, and left me alone with you and your\r\nmother.  Now I must rest a little.  Wait another hour, and you shall\r\nknow the rest.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the evening, but there was a bright moon which shone\r\noverhead, and the broad light and shadow made the rocks around us appear\r\npeculiarly wild and rugged.  They towered up one above the other till\r\nthey met the dark blue of the sky, in which the stars twinkled but\r\nfaintly, while the moon sailed through the ether, without a cloud to\r\nobscure her radiance.  And in this majestic scenery were found but two\r\nliving beings--a poor boy and a mangled wretch--a murderer--soon to\r\nbreathe his last, and be summoned before an offended God.  As I remained\r\nmotionless by his side, I felt, as I looked up, a sensation of awe, but\r\nnot of fear; I thought to myself--\"And God made all this and all the\r\nworld besides, and me and him.  The Bible said so;\" and my speculation\r\nthen was as to what God must be, for although I had read the Bible, I\r\nhad but a confused idea, and had it been asked me, as it was to the man\r\nin the chariot by Philip, \"Understandest thou what thou readest?\"  I\r\nmost certainly should have answered, No.  I remained for nearly two\r\nhours in this reverie, and at last fell asleep with my back against the\r\nrock.  I was, however, wakened up by Jackson's voice, when he asked in a\r\nlow tone for water.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" said I, handing it to him.  \"Have you called long?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied he, \"I asked but once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been asleep,\" said I.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had drunk, he said--\"I will finish now; my side begins to\r\nburn.\"  He then proceeded--\"It was about four months after your father's\r\ndeath, that Captain James and I went together to the ravine to collect\r\nfirewood.  We passed under the wall of rock, which you know so well, and\r\nwent through the gap, as we call it, when Captain James left the\r\nwater-course and walked along the edge of the wall.  I followed him: we\r\nboth of us had our pieces of rope in our hands with which we tied the\r\nfaggots.  Of a sudden his foot slipped, and he rolled down to the edge\r\nof the rock, but catching hold of a small bush which had fixed its roots\r\nin the rocks, he saved himself when his body was hanging half over the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\n\"`Give me the end of your rope,' said he to me, perfectly collected,\r\nalthough in such danger.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' replied I, and I intended so to do, as I perceived that, if I\r\nrefused, he could still have saved himself by the bush to which he\r\nclung.\r\n\r\n\"But the bush began to loosen and give way, and Captain James perceiving\r\nit cried out--\r\n\r\n\"`Quick, quick, the bush is giving way!'\r\n\r\n\"This assertion of his determined me not to give him the rope.  I\r\npretended to be in a great hurry to do so, but entangled it about my\r\nlegs, and then appeared occupied in clearing it, when he cried again--\r\n\r\n\"`Quick!'--and hardly had he said the word when the root of the bush\r\nsnapped, and down he fell below.\r\n\r\n\"I heard the crash as he came to the rock beneath.  See the judgment of\r\nGod--am I not now precisely in his position, lying battered and crushed\r\nas he was?  After a time I went down to where he lay, and found him\r\nexpiring.  He had just strength to say `God forgive you,' and then he\r\ndied.  It was murder, for I could have saved him and would not, and yet\r\nhe prayed to God to forgive me.  How much happier should I have felt if\r\nhe had not said that.  His `God forgive you' rang in my ears for months\r\nafterwards.  I returned to the cabin, and with a bold air stated to your\r\nmother what had happened, for I felt I could say, this time, I did not\r\ndo the deed.  She burst out into frantic exclamations, accusing me of\r\nbeing not only his murderer but the murderer of her husband.  I tried\r\nall I could do to appease her, but in vain.  For many weeks she was in a\r\nstate of melancholy and despondency, that made me fear for her life; but\r\nshe had you still to bestow her affections upon, and for your sake she\r\nlived.  I soon made this discovery.  She was now wholly in my power, but\r\nI was awed by her looks even, for a time.  At last I became bolder, and\r\nspoke to her of our becoming man and wife; she turned from me with\r\nabhorrence.  I then resorted to other means.  I prevented her from\r\nobtaining food; she would have starved with pleasure, but she could not\r\nbear to see you suffer.  I will not detail my cruelty and barbarity\r\ntowards her; suffice to say it was such that she pined away, and about\r\nsix months after the death of the captain she died, exhorting me not to\r\ninjure you, but if ever I had an opportunity, to take you to your\r\ngrandfather.  I could not refuse this demand, made by a woman whom I as\r\ncertainly killed by slow means as I had your father by a more sudden\r\ndeath.  I buried her in the guano, by the side of the others.  After her\r\ndeath my life was a torture to me for a long while.  I dared not kill\r\nyou, but I hated you.  I had only one consolation, one hope, which\r\noccasionally gave me satisfaction; the consolation, if so it could be\r\ncalled, was, that I had possession of the diamonds; the hope--that I\r\nshould one day see England again.  You see me now--are they not all\r\navenged?\"\r\n\r\nI could not but feel the truth of Jackson's last sentence.  They were\r\nindeed avenged.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause, he said to me--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank, I feel that the mortification in my side is making great\r\nprogress, and, in a short time, I shall be in too great pain to talk to\r\nyou.  I have made a full confession of my crimes; it is all the\r\nreparation I can make to you.  Now, can you forgive me?  For I shall die\r\nvery miserable if you do not.  Just look at me.  Can you feel resentment\r\nagainst one in my wretched state?  Recollect that you pray to be\r\nforgiven as you forgive others.  Give me your answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--yes, I feel that I can forgive you, Jackson,\" replied I.  \"I\r\nshall soon be left alone on this island, and I am sure I should be much\r\nmore miserable than I shall be, if I do not forgive you.  I do forgive\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks; you are a good boy, and may God bless you.  Is it not nearly\r\ndaylight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is.  I shall soon be able to read the Bible or Prayer-book to\r\nyou.  I have them both here.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pain is too severe, and becomes worse every minute.  I shall not be\r\nable to listen to you now; but I shall have some moments of quiet before\r\nI die; and then--\"\r\n\r\nJackson groaned heavily, and ceased speaking.\r\n\r\nFor many hours he appeared to suffer much agony, which he vented in low\r\ngroans; the perspiration hung on his forehead in large beads, and his\r\nbreathing became laborious.  The sun rose and had nearly set again\r\nbefore Jackson spoke; at last he asked for some drink.\r\n\r\n\"It is over now,\" said he, faintly.  \"The pain is subsiding, and death\r\nis near at hand.  You may read to me now; but, first, while I think of\r\nit, let me tell you where you will find your father's property.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" replied I; \"in your bed-place under the board.  I saw you\r\nremove it when you did not see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"True.  I have no more to say; it will all be over soon.  Read the\r\nburial service over me after I am dead; and now, while still above, read\r\nme what you think I shall like best; for I cannot collect myself\r\nsufficiently to tell you what is most proper.  Indeed I hardly know.\r\nBut I can pray at times.  Read on.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and came upon the parable of the prodigal son.\r\n\r\n\"That suits me,\" said Jackson.  \"Now let me pray.  Pray for me, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how,\" replied I; \"you never taught me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, no!\"\r\n\r\nJackson was then silent.  I saw his pale lips move for some time.  I\r\nturned away for a few moments; when I came back to him, he was no more!\r\nHis jaw had fallen; and this being the first time that I had ever faced\r\ndeath, I looked upon the corpse with horror and dismay.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes I left the body, and sat down on a rock at some\r\ndistance from it, for I was somewhat afraid to be near to it.  On this\r\nrock I remained till the sun was sinking below the horizon; when,\r\nalarmed at the idea of being there when it was dark, I took up my books\r\nand hastened back to the cabin.  I was giddy from excitement, and not\r\nhaving tasted food for many hours.  As soon as I had eaten, I lay down\r\nin my bed-place, intending to reflect upon what I was to do, now that I\r\nwas alone; but I was in a few moments fast asleep, and did not wake\r\nuntil the sun was high.  I arose much refreshed, and, seeing my Bible\r\nand Prayer-book close to my bed-place, I recollected my promise to\r\nJackson that I would read the burial service over his body.  I found the\r\nplace in the Prayer-book, for I had read it more than once before; and,\r\nhaving just looked over it, I went with my book to where the body lay.\r\nIt presented a yet more hideous spectacle than it had the night before.\r\nI read the service and closed the book.  \"What can I do?\" thought I.  \"I\r\ncannot bury him in the guano.  It will be impossible to carry the body\r\nover these rocks.\"  Indeed, if it had been possible, I do not think I\r\ncould have touched it.  I was afraid of it.  At last I determined that I\r\nwould cover it up with the fragments of rocks which lay about in all\r\ndirections, and I did so.  This occupied me about two hours, and then,\r\ncarrying the bottles with me, I gladly hastened away from the spot, with\r\na resolution never to revisit it.  I felt quite a relief when I was once\r\nmore in the cabin.  I was alone, it was true, but I was no longer in\r\ncontact with the dead.  I could not collect my thoughts or analyse my\r\nfeelings during the remainder of the day.  I sat with my head resting on\r\nmy hand, in the attitude of one thinking; but at the same time my mind\r\nwas vacant.  I once more lay down to sleep, and the following morning I\r\nfound myself invigorated, and capable of acting as well as thinking.  I\r\nhad a weight upon my spirits which I could not at first account for; but\r\nit arose from the feeling that I was now alone, without a soul to speak\r\nto or communicate with; my lips must now be closed till I again fell in\r\nwith some of my fellow-creatures--and was that likely?  We had seen some\r\nof them perish not far from us, and that was all, during a period of\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nI was now, by Jackson's account, nearly fourteen years old.  During\r\nfourteen years but one vessel had been seen by us.  It might be fourteen\r\nmore, or double that time might elapse, before I should again fall in\r\nwith any of my fellow-creatures.  As these thoughts saddened me, I felt\r\nhow much I would have sacrificed if Jackson had remained alive, were it\r\nonly for his company; I would have forgiven him anything.  I even then\r\nfelt as if, in the murderer of my father, I had lost a friend.\r\n\r\nThat day I was so unsettled I could not do anything; I tried to read,\r\nbut I could not; I tried to eat, but my appetite was gone.  I sat\r\nlooking at the ocean as it rolled wave after wave, sometimes wondering\r\nwhether it would ever bring a fellow-creature to join me; at others I\r\nsat, and for hours, in perfect vacuity of thought.  The evening closed\r\nin, it was dark, and I still remained seated where I was.  At last I\r\nreturned to my bed, almost broken-hearted; but fortunately I was soon\r\nasleep, and my sorrows were forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnother morning was gladdened with a brilliant sun, the dark blue ocean\r\nwas scarcely ruffled by the breeze that swept over it, and I felt my\r\nspirits much revived, and my appetite returned.  After taking a meal, I\r\nremembered what Jackson had told me about the belt with the diamonds,\r\nand I went up to his bed-place, and turning out the birds' skins and\r\nfeathers, I raked up the gravel, which was not more than two inches\r\ndeep, and came to the board.  I lifted it up, and found underneath a\r\nhole, about a foot deep, full of various articles.  There were the watch\r\nand sleeve-buttons of the mate, some dollars wrapped in old rags, a\r\ntobacco-box, an old pipe, a brooch with hair forming initials, some\r\nletters which were signed J. Evelyn, and which I perceived were from my\r\ngrandfather, and probably taken by Jackson after my mother's death.  I\r\nsay letters, because they were such, as I afterwards found out, but I\r\nhad not then ever seen a letter, and my first attempt to decipher\r\nwritten hand was useless, although I did manage to make out the\r\nsignature.  There was in the tobacco-box a plain gold wedding-ring,\r\nprobably my mother's; and there was also a lock of long dark hair, which\r\nI presumed was hers also.  There were three or four specimens of what I\r\nafterwards found out to be gold and silver ores, a silver pencil-case,\r\nand a pair of small gold ear-rings.  At the bottom of the hole was the\r\nbelt; it was of soft leather, and I could feel a hard substance in it\r\nsewed in every square, which of course I presumed were the diamonds, but\r\nI did not cut one of the divisions open to see what was in them.  It had\r\non the upper part of it, in very plain writing, \"The property of Mr J.\r\nEvelyn, 33, Minories, London.\"  I examined all these articles one after\r\nanother, and having satisfied my curiosity, I replaced them in the hole\r\nfor a future survey.  I covered the hole with the board, and put back\r\nthe gravel and the feathers into the bed-place.  This occupied me about\r\ntwo hours, and then I again took my former position on the rocks, and\r\nremained in a state of listless inactivity of body and mind the\r\nremainder of that day.\r\n\r\nThis state of prostration lasted for many days--I may say for weeks,\r\nbefore it was altogether removed.  I could find no pleasure in my books,\r\nwhich were taken up, and after a few moments laid aside.  It was now\r\nwithin a month of the time that the birds should come to the island.  I\r\nwas in no want of them for sustenance; there were plenty left, but I\r\nalmost loathed the sight of food.  The reader may inquire how it was\r\nthat I knew the exact time of the arrival of the birds?  I reply that\r\nthe only reckoning ever kept by Jackson and me was the arrival of the\r\nfull moons, and we also made a mark on the rock every time that the moon\r\nwas at the full.  Thirteen moons were the quantity which we reckoned\r\nfrom the time of the birds appearing on the island one year, until their\r\nre-appearance the next; and twelve moons had now passed.  At length,\r\ntired with everything, tired of myself; and I may say, almost tired of\r\nlife, I one day took it into my head that I would take some provisions\r\nwith me and a bottle to hold water, and go up the ravine, and cut\r\nfirewood which should last me a long while; and that I would remain up\r\nthere for several days, for I hated the sight of the cabin and of all\r\nthat was near to it.  The next day I acted upon this resolution, and\r\nslinging my dry provisions on my shoulder, I set off for the ravine.  In\r\nan hour I had gained it; but not being in a hurry to cut wood, I\r\nresolved upon climbing higher up, to see if I could reach the opposite\r\nside of the island; that is, at least, get over the brow of the hill, to\r\nhave a good view of it.  I continued to climb until I had gained a\r\nsmooth grassy spot, which was clear of brushwood; and as I sat down to\r\nrest myself, I observed some blue flowers which I had never seen before;\r\nindeed I did not know that there was a flower on the island.  As I\r\nafterwards discovered, they were one of the varieties of Gentianellas.\r\nI looked at them, admired them, and felt quite an affection for them;\r\nthey were very pretty, and they were, as well as myself, alone.\r\nJackson, when I was pointing out the English cottages in the landscapes\r\nof Mayor's Natural History, had told me a great deal about gardening in\r\nEngland, and how wild flowers and trees were transplanted and improved\r\nby culture; how roses and other plants were nailed up the walls as I had\r\nobserved in the engraving, and how they were watered and kept; and as I\r\nsat down looking at the flower, the thought occurred to me, Why should I\r\nnot take it with me, and keep it for myself?  I can water it and take\r\ncare of it.  I resolved that I would do so, for I already looked upon\r\nthe plant as a treasure.  I took it up carefully with my American knife,\r\nleaving sufficient mould about the roots, and then I proceeded to ascend\r\nthe hill; but before I had gone another hundred yards, I found at least\r\na dozen more of these plants in flower, all finer than the one I had dug\r\nup, and three or four others very different from these, which were also\r\nquite new to me.  I was puzzled what to do; I put down the plants I had\r\ndug up and continued my ascent, not having made up my mind.  After half\r\nan hour's climbing, I gained the summit, and could perceive the ocean on\r\nthe other side, and the other half of the island lying beneath me.  It\r\nwas very grand from the height I stood on, but I observed little\r\ndifference between one side of the island and the other; all was rugged\r\nbarren rock as on my side, with the exception of the portion close to\r\nme; this had brushwood in the ravine, which appeared to be a sort of\r\ncleft through the island.  All was silent and solitary; not a bird was\r\nto be seen, and nothing that had life could I discover.  I was about to\r\nreturn, when I thought I might as well go down the ravine facing me for\r\na little way, and see what there was in it.  I did so, and discovered\r\nsome other plants that I had not seen on my side of the island.  There\r\nwere also some fern trees, and some twining plants running up them, and\r\nI thought to myself, Why, these plants are what I saw in the picture of\r\nthe English cottages, or very like them.  I wonder if they would run up\r\nmy cabin?  And then all at once the idea came to me that I would plant\r\nsome of them round the cabin, and that I would make a garden of flowers,\r\nand have plants of my own.  The reader can hardly imagine the pleasure\r\nthat this idea gave me; I sat down to ruminate upon it, and felt quite\r\nhappy for the time.  I now recollected, however, that the cabin was\r\nbuilt on the rock, and that plants would only grow in the earth.  At\r\nfirst this idea chilled me, as it seemed to destroy all my schemes, but\r\nI resolved that I would bring some earth to the rock, and make my garden\r\nin that way.  I at first thought of the guano, but Jackson had told me\r\nthat it was only used in small proportions to enrich the soil, and would\r\nkill plants if used by itself.  After an hour's consideration, during\r\nwhich I called to mind all that Jackson had told me on the subject, I\r\nmade up my mind I would return to the cabin, and on my return ascertain\r\nhow low down the ravine I could obtain earth for my garden; I would then\r\ncarry the earth to the cabin, make a soil ready for the plants and\r\nflowers, and then, when all was ready, I would go up the ravine, collect\r\nwhat I could, and make my garden.  I did so.  I found that I could get\r\nsoil about one-third of the way up the ravine, a quarter of a mile below\r\nwhere the brushwood grew; and having ascertained that, I returned to the\r\ncabin, threw down my provisions which were to have lasted me a week, and\r\nas it was late, I decided that I would not commence operations until the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nI took out of the chest a duck frock, and tying up the sleeves and\r\ncollar, so as to form a bag of the body of the frock, I set off the next\r\nmorning to begin my task.  That day I contrived to carry to the cabin\r\nten or twelve bags of mould, which I put round it in a border about four\r\nfeet wide and about a foot deep.  It occupied me a whole week to obtain\r\nthe quantity of earth necessary to make the bed on each side of the\r\ncabin; it was hard work, but it made me cheerful and happy to what I had\r\nbeen before.  I found that the best cure for melancholy and solitude was\r\nemployment, so I thus obtained valuable knowledge as well as the making\r\nof my garden.  When I had finished carrying the mould, I started off for\r\nthe ravine with two bags to hold the plants which I might collect, and\r\nafter a day's toil, I returned with my bags full of small shrubs,\r\nbesides a bundle of creepers to plant against the sides of the cabin.\r\nThe following day was occupied in planting everything I had procured.  I\r\nwas sorry to see that the leaves and flowers hung down, but I watered\r\nthem all before I went to bed.  The next morning I was delighted to\r\nperceive that they had all recovered and were looking quite fresh.  But\r\nmy garden was not full enough to please me, and I once more went up the\r\nravine, selecting other plants which had no flowers on them, and one or\r\ntwo other shrubs, which I had not before observed.  When these were\r\nplanted and watered, my garden looked very gay and full of plants, and\r\nthen I discovered the mould came down for want of support at the edges;\r\nI therefore went and picked up pieces of rock of sufficient size to make\r\na border and hold up the mould, and now all was complete, and I had\r\nnothing to do but to go on watering them daily.  This I did, and\r\nrecollecting what Jackson had said about the guano, I got a bag of it,\r\nand put some to each plant.  The good effect of this was soon\r\nobservable, and before the birds came, my garden was in a very\r\nflourishing condition.\r\n\r\nI cannot express to the reader the pleasure I derived from this little\r\ngarden.  I knew every plant and every shrub, talked to them as if they\r\nwere companions, while I watered and tended them, which I did every\r\nnight and morning, and their rapid growth was my delight.  I no longer\r\nfelt my solitude so irksome as I had done.  I had something to look\r\nafter, to interest me, and to love; they were alive as well as I was;\r\nthey grew, and threw out leaves and flowers; they were grateful for the\r\ncare I bestowed upon them, and became my companions and friends.\r\n\r\nI before mentioned that during the latter portion of the time I was with\r\nJackson, he had taught me to sing several songs.  Feeling tired, in my\r\nsolitude, of not hearing the human voice, I found myself at first\r\nhumming over, and afterwards singing aloud, the various airs I had\r\ncollected from him.  This afforded me much pleasure, and I used to sing\r\nhalf the day.  I had no one to listen to me, it is true; but as my\r\nfondness for my garden increased, I used to sit down and sing to the\r\nflowers and shrubs, and fancy that they listened to me.  But my stock of\r\nsongs was not very large, and at last I had repeated them so often that\r\nI became tired of the words.  It occurred to me that the Prayer-book had\r\nthe Psalms of David at the end of it, set to music.  I got the book, and\r\nas far as the airs that I knew would suit, I sang them all; never were\r\nPsalms, probably, sung to such tunes before, but it amused me, and there\r\nwas no want of variety of language.\r\n\r\nEvery three or four days I would go up the ravine, and search carefully\r\nfor any new flower or shrub which I had not yet planted in my garden,\r\nand when I found one, as I often did, it was a source of great delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nAt last the birds came, and I procured some of their eggs, which were a\r\nvery agreeable change, after living so long upon dried meat.  My want of\r\noccupation occasioned me also to employ some of my time in fishing,\r\nwhich I seldom had done while Jackson was alive; and this created a\r\nvariety in my food, to which, for a long while, I had been a stranger.\r\nJackson did not care for fish, as to cook it we were obliged to go up\r\nthe ravine for wood, and he did not like the trouble.  When the birds\r\ncame, I had recourse to my book on Natural History, to read over again\r\nthe accounts of the Man-of-War birds, Gannets, and other birds mentioned\r\nin it; and there was a vignette of a Chinaman with tame cormorants on a\r\npole, and in the letter-press an account of how they were trained and\r\nemployed to catch fish for their masters.  This gave me the idea that I\r\nwould have some birds tame, as companions, and, if possible, teach them\r\nto catch fish for me; but I knew that I must wait till the young birds\r\nwere fit to be taken from the nest.\r\n\r\nI now resolved that during the time the birds were mating, I would go to\r\nthe ravine and remain there several days, to collect bundles of\r\nfirewood.  The firewood was chiefly cut from a sort of low bush, like\r\nthe sallow or willow, fit for making baskets, indeed fit for anything\r\nbetter than firewood; however, there were some bushes which were of a\r\nharder texture, and which burnt well.  It was Jackson who told me that\r\nthe former were called Willow and used for making baskets, and he also\r\nshowed me how to tie the faggots up by twisting the sallows together.\r\nThey were not, however, what Jackson said they were--from after\r\nknowledge, I should say that they were a species of Oleander, or\r\nsomething of the kind.\r\n\r\nHaving roasted several dozen of eggs quite hard, by way of provision, I\r\nset off one morning, and went to the ravine.  As Jackson had said\r\nbefore, you had to walk under a wall of rock thirty feet high, and then\r\npass through a water-course to get up to the ravine, which increased the\r\ndistance to where the shrubs grew, at least half a mile.  It was over\r\nthis wall that the captain fell and was killed, because Jackson would\r\nnot assist him.  I gained the thicket where the bushes grew, and for\r\nthree days I worked very hard, and had cut down and tied about fifty\r\nlarge faggots, when I thought that I had collected enough to last me for\r\na long while; but I had still to carry them down, and this was a heavy\r\ntask, as I could not carry more than one at a time.  It occurred to me\r\nthat if I threw my faggots over the wall opposite to where they had been\r\ncut down, I should save myself nearly a mile of carriage, as otherwise I\r\nhad to walk all the way to the water-course which divided the wall of\r\nrock, and then walk back again.  Indeed, where I cut down the wood was\r\nnot more than a quarter of a mile from the bathing-pool, and all down\r\nhill.  I was delighted at this idea, which I wondered had never occurred\r\nto Jackson, and I commenced putting it into execution.  The top of the\r\nwall of rock was slippery from the constant trickling of the water over\r\nthe surface, but this was only in some places.  I carried my faggots\r\ndown one by one, and threw them over, being careful not to lose my\r\nfooting in so doing.  I had carried all but three or four, and had\r\nbecome careless, when, on heaving one over, my heels were thrown up, and\r\nbefore I could recover myself I slid down the remainder of the ledge and\r\nwas precipitated down below, a distance of more than thirty feet.  I\r\nmust have remained there many hours insensible, but at last I recovered\r\nand found myself lying on the faggots which I had thrown down.  It was\r\nmy falling on the faggots, instead of the hard rock, which had saved my\r\nlife.  I rose as soon as I could collect my scattered senses.  I felt\r\nvery sore and very much shaken, and the blood was running out of my\r\nmouth, but there were no bones broken.  I was, however, too ill to\r\nattempt anything more that day.  I walked home at a very slow pace and\r\nwent to bed.  A sound sleep restored me, and in a day or two I was quite\r\nrecovered.  I watered my plants, which I found drooping, as if they had\r\ngrieved at my being so long away from them, and then I returned to where\r\nmy faggots had been left; and to lighten my labour I resolved to carry\r\nthem down to the bathing-pool and stack them up there on the rocks near\r\nto it.  I mention this for reasons that the reader will comprehend\r\nby-and-bye.  This occupied me two days, for I was not inclined, after my\r\nfall, to work hard; and very glad was I when the labour was over.\r\n\r\nThe young birds were now hatched, but I had to wait four or five weeks\r\nbefore they were fit to be taken.  I began again to find solitude\r\ntedious.  The flowers in my garden had all bloomed and withered, and\r\nthere was not so much to interest me.  I recommenced reading the Bible,\r\nand the narratives in the Old and New Testaments again afforded me\r\npleasure.  I hardly need say to the reader that I read the Bible as I\r\nwould have read any other book--for amusement, and not for instruction.\r\nI had learnt little from Jackson--indeed, as regards the true nature of\r\nthe Christian religion, I may say, nothing at all.  I do not believe\r\nthat he knew anything about it himself.  It is true that the precepts in\r\nthe New Testament struck me, and that I was more interested about Our\r\nSaviour than anybody else; but I could not comprehend him, or his\r\nmission.  In short, I read in darkness; and I may say that I almost knew\r\nthe Bible by heart without understanding it.--How could I?  How many\r\nthousands are there who do the same, without having an excuse to offer\r\nfor their blindness!\r\n\r\nAt last the time for taking the birds arrived, and I had then sufficient\r\nemployment to keep me from being melancholy.  I collected quite as many\r\nas we had done when Jackson and I had to be provided for; and with my\r\nnew knives my labour was comparatively easy.  As soon as I had completed\r\nmy provision, I went back to take the young birds which already I had\r\nselected and left for that purpose.  It was high time, for I found that\r\nwhen I went to take them they were ready to fly.  However, after a good\r\nbattle with the old birds (for I had taken six young ones--two from each\r\nnest, which arrayed a force of six old ones against me, who fought very\r\nvaliantly in defence of their offspring), I succeeded in carrying them\r\noff, but followed by the old birds, who now screamed and darted close to\r\nme as they came pursuing me to the cabin.  As soon as I got safe back, I\r\ntook the young birds into the cabin, tying each of them by the leg with\r\na piece of fishing-line, and the other end of the line I fastened to\r\nsome pieces of rock which I had collected ready on the platform outside\r\nof the cabin.  The old birds continued to persecute me till it was dark,\r\nand then they went away, and I, tired with my day's labour, was not\r\nsorry to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I found the old birds on the platform,\r\nin company with the young ones, I presume trying to persuade them to fly\r\naway with them; but the lines on their legs prevented that.  They did\r\nnot leave at my approach for some little while; at last they all took\r\nwing, and went off to sea; but in the course of a few minutes they\r\nreturned with some small fish in their mouths, with which they fed their\r\nyoung ones.  They continued to do this for the two following days, when\r\nthere was a general break up, announcing the departure of the main body,\r\nwhich, after much soaring and wheeling in the air, flew off in a\r\nnortherly direction.  The six parent birds, who were with their young\r\nones at the cabin, appeared for some time very uneasy, flying round and\r\nround and screaming wildly; at last they soared in the air with loud\r\nshrieks, and flew away after the main body, which was still in sight--\r\ntheir love for their young overpowered by their instinctive habits.  I\r\nwas not sorry when they were gone, as I wanted to have my new family all\r\nto myself.  I went down to the rocks and caught a fish, which was large\r\nenough to supply them for three or four days.  I fed them with the\r\ninside of the fish, and they ate it very heartily.  For several days\r\nthey appeared very uneasy; but gradually they settled, and not only\r\nappeared to know me, but to welcome my coming, which was to me a source\r\nof great pleasure.\r\n\r\nI now neglected my flowers for the birds, which were the more animated\r\nof the two; and I sat down for hours on the platform with my six\r\ncompanions, who I must own were not over-lively and intelligent, but\r\nthey were alive, and had eyes.  They seldom roused up, unless I brought\r\nthem fish, of which they had a supply four times a day, and then they\r\nwould stand on their legs and open their beaks far apart, each waiting\r\nfor its share.  They were a great happiness to me, and I watched their\r\ngradual increase of plumage and of size, which was very rapid.  I gave\r\nthem all names out of my natural history book.  One was Lion, then\r\nTiger, Panther, Bear, Horse, and Jackass (at the time that I named them,\r\nthe last would have been very appropriate to them all); and as I always\r\ncalled them by their names as I fed them, I soon found, to my great joy,\r\nthat they knew them well enough.  This delighted me.  I read my books to\r\nthem by way of amusement; I sang my songs to them; I talked to them; I\r\nwould even narrate the various histories out of the Bible to them, such\r\nas that of Joseph and his brethren, etcetera; and the stolid air with\r\nwhich the communications were received made me almost imagine they were\r\nlistened to.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, I took the line off the legs of two of them, with the\r\nprecaution of first cutting their wings, and these two became much more\r\nlively, following me into the cabin, and generally staying there during\r\nthe night.  As I found that no attempt was made to escape, I let them\r\nall loose, after having cut their wings, and they all behaved equally\r\nwell with the two first to which I had given their liberty.\r\n\r\nThe perfect obedience and good behaviour of my new companions again gave\r\nme leisure that was not altogether desirable, as it left a vacuum to\r\nfill up.  But I returned to my garden.  I could do no more at present\r\nbut water my plants and look at the increased daily growth of the\r\nclimbers, as they now boldly ascended the sides of the cabin; but I\r\nthought it was high time to go up into the ravine and about the island,\r\nto see if I could not add to my collection.\r\n\r\nOne morning I set off up the ravine.  I was not successful, so I\r\ncontented myself with carrying, by the long road, those faggots which I\r\nhad left behind me on the day when I fell over the precipice.  This\r\nlabour I finished, and then returned to the cabin, where I was met by my\r\nbirds with half-extended wings and open mouths, as if they were very\r\nglad to see me, and very hungry into the bargain.  I ought to observe\r\nthat my birds appeared now to separate into pairs, male and female, as\r\ntheir difference of plumage denoted.  Lion and Horse were always side by\r\nside, as were Jackass and Bear, and Tiger and Panther.  I now fed them\r\none by one, calling them by name, to which they immediately responded,\r\nand if any one came who was not called, it was switched for its trouble.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I set off on another voyage of discovery after plants,\r\nand this time I resolved upon trying what I could find among the\r\ncrevices of the rocks, for I had seen at a distance what appeared to me\r\nto be a very pretty flower on the ledge of one of the clefts.  I did not\r\ngo up the ravine this time, but commenced climbing the rocks behind\r\nwhere the cabin was built.  It was hard work, but I was not easily\r\ndiscouraged, and after a couple of hours, I arrived at a level which I\r\nhad in view when I commenced my labour, and here I was amply rewarded;\r\nfor I found several plants quite new to me, and a variety of ferns,\r\nwhich I thought very beautiful, although they had no flowers.  The\r\nscene, from where I stood, was awful and beautiful.  I looked down upon\r\nthe rocks below, and the cabin, which appeared very small, and I thought\r\nthat I could see my birds like dots upon the platform.  It was a bright\r\nday and smooth water, and I could clearly distinguish the other islands\r\nin the distance, and I thought that I saw something like a white speck\r\nclose to them--perhaps it was a vessel.  This made me melancholy, and I\r\ncould not help asking myself whether I was to remain all my life upon\r\nthe island, alone, or if there were any chance of my ever being taken\r\noff it.  As I looked down upon the cabin, I was surprised at the\r\nsteepness of the rocks which I had climbed, and felt alarmed, as if I\r\nnever should be able to get back again.  But these thoughts were soon\r\nchased away.  I turned from the seaward, and looked inland.  I found\r\nthat on one side of me there was a chasm between the rocks, the bottom\r\nof which was so far down that I could not see it; and on the other side\r\nthe rock rose up as straight as a wall.  My attention was soon diverted\r\nby discovering another plant, and I now commenced my task of digging\r\nthem all up.  I obtained, with the ferns, about twenty new varieties,\r\nwhich I made up in a bundle ready for carrying down slung round my neck;\r\nfor I knew that I should require both hands to descend with.  Then I sat\r\ndown to rest myself a little before I commenced my return, and after I\r\nhad been seated a few minutes, I thought I would sing a song by way of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nI have before said that, tired of repeating the words of the songs which\r\nJackson had taught me, I had taken those of Psalms in metre, at the end\r\nof the Prayer-book, by way of variety; and, as far as metre went, they\r\nanswered very well, although people would have been surprised to have\r\nheard Psalms sung to such quick and varied measure.  The Psalm I chose\r\nthis time was the first--\"How blest is he who ne'er consents;\" and I\r\nbegan accordingly; but when I came to the end of the line, to my\r\nastonishment I heard a plaintive voice, at a distance, repeat after me\r\n\"con-sents.\"  I looked round.  I thought I must have been deceived, so I\r\ncontinued--\"By ill advice to walk.\"  This time I could not be\r\nmistaken--\"to walk,\" was repeated by the same voice as plainly as\r\npossible.  I stopped singing, lost in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"There must be somebody on the island as well as myself,\" thought I; for\r\nI never had heard an echo before, except when it thundered, and such\r\nechoes I had put down as a portion of the thunder.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" cried I.\r\n\r\n\"Who's there?\" replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\"It's me!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's me!\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nI did not know what to make of it.  I cried out again and again, and\r\nagain and again I heard what I said repeated, but no answer to my\r\nquestions.  I thought I was insulted by somebody, and yet, when I\r\nlistened, the voice that spoke came from the face of the rock on the\r\nother side of the chasm, and no one could be there without my seeing\r\nthem.  This made me think that I was mistaken, and that there could not\r\nbe anybody, but still I could not solve the mystery.  At last I became\r\nfrightened, and as the sun was now setting, I determined to get back to\r\nthe cabin.  I did so, and went down much faster than I had gone up, for\r\nas it grew dark I became the more alarmed.  The only thing that\r\nreassured me was the softness and plaintiveness of the voice--not like\r\nJackson's, but as of some one who would not think of injuring me.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was, generally speaking, quiet and content with my isolated\r\nposition, yet it was only when I was employed or amused with my\r\nfavourites.  At times, I could not find anything to do, and was overcome\r\nby weariness.  I would then throw away my books, and remain for hours\r\nthinking upon the probability of my ever again seeing a fellow-creature;\r\nand a fit of melancholy would come over me, which would last many days.\r\nI was in one of these moods, when it occurred to me, that although I had\r\nseen the other side of the island from the summit, I had not gone down\r\nto the beach to explore it; and I resolved that I would do so, making a\r\ntrip of three or four days.  When my knives had become blunt, Jackson\r\nhad told me how to sharpen them by rubbing the blades upon a hard flat\r\npiece of rock wetted with water.  This I had found to answer very well,\r\nand I now determined I would try and sharpen one of the old axes in the\r\nsame way, so as to make it serviceable, for I was very much afraid of\r\nbreaking my knives in cutting down the brushwood, and I knew how much\r\nmore rapidly it could be done with an axe.  I picked out a large stone,\r\nsuitable for the purpose, and with a kid of water at hand, I set-to to\r\nsharpen the axe.  It was a long job, but in a day or two I had succeeded\r\nadmirably, and the axe was in good order.  I then thought how I could\r\nleave my birds for so many days, as they would require food.  At last I\r\nconsidered that if I caught two large fish and cut them up, they would\r\nbe sufficient for their sustenance.  I did so, and, provided with a\r\npacket of dried birds for food, tied up in a duck frock, with my Natural\r\nHistory book for amusement, a pannikin to get water in, my axe on my\r\nshoulder, and my knives by my side--I first kissed all the birds, and\r\ntold them to remain quiet and good till I came back--I set off on a\r\nbright clear morning on my tour of examination.\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours I had gained the summit of the island, and prepared\r\nfor my descent, by sitting down and eating my dinner.  I observed that,\r\nas before, the water on the other side of the island was quite smooth,\r\ncompared to what it was on the side where I resided.  It was, in fact,\r\nfrom the prevailing winds during the year, the lee side of the island.\r\nHaving rested myself sufficiently, I commenced my descent, which I\r\naccomplished in little less time than it took me to ascend from the\r\nother side.  As I neared the rocks by the shore, I thought I perceived\r\nsomething occasionally moving about on them.  I was not mistaken, for as\r\nI came closer, I found that there were several large animals lying on\r\nthe rocks, and occasionally dropping into the sea close to them.\r\n\r\nThe sight of anything living was to me of great interest.  I determined\r\nto get nearer, and ascertain what animals they were.  At last, by\r\ncreeping along from rock to rock, I arrived to within forty yards of\r\nthem.  I recollected some animals of the same shape in my book of\r\nNatural History, which, fortunately, I had with me in the duck frock,\r\nand sitting down behind the rock, I pulled it out, and turned over the\r\npages until I came to a print which exactly answered to their\r\nappearance.  It was the Seal.  Having satisfied myself on that point, I\r\nread the history of the animal, and found that it was easily tamed, and\r\nvery affectionate when taken young, and also might be easily killed by a\r\nblow on the nose.  These, at least, were for me the two most important\r\npieces of information.  It occurred to me that it would be very pleasant\r\nto have a young seal for a playmate (for the gannets, after all, were\r\nnot very intelligent), and I resolved to obtain one if I could.  I put\r\ndown my duck frock with my provisions behind the rock, and taking my axe\r\nin my hand, I cautiously advanced to where the animals lay.  There were\r\nabout twenty of them all together on one rock, but they were all large,\r\nand seemed to be about five or six feet long.  I could not see a small\r\none anywhere, so I walked in behind the rocks further to the right,\r\ntowards another rock, where I saw another batch of them lying.  As I\r\nneared them, I saw by herself, a seal with a young one by her side, not\r\nmore than two feet long.  This was what I wanted.  They lay at some\r\ndistance from the water, upon a low rock.  I watched them for some time,\r\nand was much amused at the prattling which passed between the old and\r\nthe young one.  I thought that to obtain the young one, I must of course\r\nkill the old one, for I perceived that it had large teeth.  I considered\r\nit advisable to get between them and the water, that they might not\r\nescape me, and I contrived so to do, before I made my appearance.  As\r\nsoon as the old one perceived me running to them, it gave a shrill cry,\r\nand then floundered towards the water; as we came close together, it\r\nshowed its teeth, and rose upon its flappers to defend itself and its\r\nyoung one, which kept close to its side; but a blow on its nose with the\r\naxe rendered it motionless, and apparently dead.  Delighted with my\r\nsuccess, I seized hold of the young one and took it in my arms, and was\r\ncarrying it away, when I found myself confronted with the male seal,\r\nwhich, alarmed by the cry of the female, had come to her assistance.  It\r\nwas much larger than the female, with more shaggy hair about the neck\r\nand shoulders, and apparently very fierce.  I could not pass it, as it\r\nwas in-shore of me, and I had just time to drop the young seal, and leap\r\nbehind a rock on one side, with my axe all ready.  The animal reared\r\nitself on the rock to pass over to me, when I saluted it with a blow on\r\nthe head, which staggered it.  I had lost my presence of mind by the\r\ncreature coming upon me so unexpectedly, and my blow was not well aimed;\r\nbut before it could recover the first blow, another on its nose tumbled\r\nit over, to all appearance lifeless.  I then hastened to gain the other\r\nside of the rock, where I had left the young seal, and found that it had\r\ncrept to its mother's body, and was fondling it.  I took it in my arms,\r\nand retreated to where I had left my duck frock, and throwing everything\r\nelse out, I put the animal in, and tied up the end, so that it could not\r\nescape.  I then sat down to recover myself from the excitement\r\noccasioned by this first engagement I had ever been in, quite delighted\r\nwith my newly-acquired treasure.\r\n\r\nI then thought what I should do.  It was now within an hour of dark, and\r\nwas too late to return to the other side of the island, or I would have\r\ndone so, as I was anxious to get my seal home.  At last I decided that I\r\nwould go farther from the beach, and take up my quarters for the night.\r\nI collected my provision, and with my seal under my arm, I walked away\r\nabout one hundred yards from the water's edge, and took up a position\r\nunder a large rock; here I ate my supper, and then untied the line which\r\nclosed up the frock, and had a parting look at my little friend before I\r\nwent to sleep.  He had struggled a good deal at first, but was now\r\nquiet, although he occasionally made attempts to bite me.  I coaxed him\r\nand fondled him a good deal, and then put him into his bag again, and\r\nmade him secure, which appeared to annoy him very much, as he was not\r\nhalf as quiet in a bag as he was when I held him in my lap.  I then took\r\nmy book to read over again the history of the seal, and I found that\r\ntheir skins were valuable, and also that they gave a great deal of oil;\r\nbut I had no use for oil, though I thought that their skins might be\r\nvery comfortable in my bed-place.  I shut my book and lay down to sleep,\r\nbut I could not obtain any till near daylight, I had been so excited,\r\nand was so anxious about my treasure.  The sun shining in my eyes woke\r\nme up; I found my seal was lying very quiet, I touched him to see that\r\nhe was not dead; and the cry that he gave assured me to the contrary.  I\r\nthen walked back to where I had left the bodies of the parents.  I found\r\non examination that they were both dead, and also that their furs were\r\nvery beautiful, and I resolved that I would have their skins.  But here\r\nwas a difficulty.  If I took off the skins, I could not carry them with\r\nme, and I was anxious to get the young one home, lest it should die of\r\nhunger; so I decided that I would first take home the young one, give it\r\nfood and warm it, and then return and skin the old ones.\r\n\r\nI therefore made my breakfast, and leaving the remainder of my provision\r\nin a cleft in the rock, that I might not have the trouble of bringing it\r\nagain, I set off on my return, and used such diligence that I was back\r\nat the cabin by noon.  I found my birds all well, and apparently quite\r\nsatisfied with the provision that I had left them, for they were most of\r\nthem asleep, and those that were awake did not notice my arrival.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" thought I, \"you only like me for what I give you; next time I go\r\naway I will leave you hungry, and then, when you see me come back, you\r\nwill all flutter your wings with gladness.\"\r\n\r\nI was puzzled where to put my seal so as to keep him safe: at last I\r\ndecided upon opening the seaman's chest and putting him in that.  I did\r\nso, and gave him a piece of fish which the birds had not eaten.  The\r\nlittle creature devoured it eagerly, and I took my lines and went down\r\nto catch some fish for a further supply.  In half an hour I returned\r\nwith two large fish, and I then took the seal out of the chest and fed\r\nhim again.  He ate very heartily; and I was glad to perceive that he\r\nappeared much tamer already.  I threw some of the insides of the fish to\r\nthe birds, who were now become of very inferior interest to me.  Having\r\nfed my animals, I then thought of myself, and, as I took my meal, I\r\narranged that the next morning I would go over to the other side of the\r\nisland, skin the two seals, and spread out the skins on the rocks to\r\ndry, and would leave them there till I had a better opportunity of\r\nbringing them to the cabin; at present I could not be away from my new\r\nacquaintance, which I wished to make tame and fond of me.  Having fed\r\nhim again in the morning, I put down the lid of the chest, and then\r\nstarted for the lee side of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nI arrived early, skinned both the seals, and dragged the skins up from\r\nthe water side, though with difficulty, especially that of the large\r\none, to the rock where I had taken up my quarters the night before.\r\nHere I spread them out to dry, putting large pieces of rock upon the\r\nedges, that they might not be blown away.  It was nearly dusk when I had\r\nfinished, but I set off, and an hour after dark arrived at the cabin;\r\nfor now that I knew my way so well, I got over the ground twice as fast\r\nas I did before.  I crawled into my bed-place in the dark, and slept\r\nsoundly after my fatigue.  I awoke the next morning with the plaintive\r\ncry of my seal in the chest, and I hastened to get some fish to feed him\r\nwith.  I took him out and fed him; and was astonished how tame the\r\nlittle animal had become already.  He remained very quietly with me\r\nafter he had been fed, nestling close to my side, as if I had been his\r\nmother, and even making a half attempt to follow me when I left him.\r\n\r\nMy birds appeared very dull and stupid, and I observed also that they\r\nwere very dirty, and always rushed to the kid when it was full of water,\r\ntrying to get into it.  This made me think that they required bathing in\r\nsalt-water, and I took one down to the bathing-pool, with a long line to\r\nits leg, and put it in.  The manner in which the poor creature\r\nfloundered, and dipped and washed itself, for several minutes, proved my\r\nsupposition correct; so, after allowing it half an hour for its\r\nrecreation, I took it back, and went down with the others until they had\r\nall indulged in the luxury of a bath; and from that time, as I took them\r\ndown almost every day, it was astonishing how much brighter and sleeker\r\ntheir plumage became.\r\n\r\nI remained a week in the cabin, taming my seal, who now was quite fond\r\nof me; and one night, as I was going to bed, he crawled into my\r\nbed-place, and from that time he was my bedfellow.  At the end of a week\r\nI went over to the other side of the island, and contrived to carry up\r\nthe two skins to the summit.  It was a hard day's work.  The day\r\nafterwards I conveyed them to the cabin, and, as they were quite dry, I\r\nput them into my bed-place to lie down upon, as I did not like the smell\r\nof the bird's feathers, although I had so long been accustomed to them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what with my seal, my birds, and my garden, and the occupation\r\nthey gave me, the time passed quickly away, until, by my reckoning, it\r\nwas nearly the period for the birds to come again.  I observed, as the\r\ntime drew near, that my birds were uneasy.  They had paired, as I\r\nmentioned before, and when their plumage was complete, it was evident\r\nthat they had paired male and female, as I had supposed.  They had not\r\nbeen tethered for a long while, and appeared to me now very much\r\ninclined to fly, especially the male birds.  At first I thought that I\r\nwould cut all their wings, as I was fearful that they would join the\r\nother birds on their arrival, but observing that they were so fond of\r\ntheir mates, I resolved to cut the wing of the females only, as I did\r\nnot think that the male birds would leave them.  I did so, and took my\r\nchance; for, since I had the seal for a companion, I did not care so\r\nmuch for the birds as before.  At last the birds came, and took\r\npossession of the guano-ground as usual, and I went for fresh eggs; at\r\nthe same time I found that my females were scratching, as if they would\r\nmake their nests, and a few days afterwards they began to lay.  I then\r\nthought that as soon as they had young ones they would wish to go away,\r\nso I took the eggs that were laid, to prevent them; but I found that as\r\nfast as I took away the eggs they laid more, and this they did for\r\nnearly two months, supplying me with fresh eggs long after the wild\r\nbirds had hatched, and left the island.  The male birds, at the time\r\nthat the females first laid their eggs, tried their wings in short\r\nflights in circles; and then flew away out to sea.  I thought that they\r\nwere gone; but I was deceived, for they returned in about a quarter of\r\nan hour, each with a fish in its beak, which they laid down before their\r\nmates.  I was much pleased at this, and I resolved that in future they\r\nshould supply their own food, which they did; and not their own food\r\nonly, but enough for the seal and me also, when the weather was fine;\r\nbut when it was rough, they could not obtain any, and then I was obliged\r\nto feed them.  The way I obtained from them the extra supply of fish\r\nwas, that when they first went out, I seized, on their return the fish\r\nwhich they brought; and as often as I did this, they would go for more,\r\nuntil the females were fed.\r\n\r\nBut I had one difficulty to contend with, which was, that at the time\r\nthe birds could not obtain fish, which was when the weather was rough, I\r\ncould not neither, as they would not take the bait.  After some\r\ncogitation, I decided that I would divide a portion of the bathing-pool\r\nfarthest from the shore, by a wall of loose rock which the water could\r\nflow through, but which the fish could not get out of, and that I would\r\ncatch fish in the fine weather to feed the seal and the birds when the\r\nweather was rough and bad.  As soon as I had finished curing my stock of\r\nprovisions and got it safely housed in the cabin, I set to work to make\r\nthis wall, which did not take me a very long while, as the water was not\r\nmore than two feet deep, and the pool about ten yards across.  As soon\r\nas it was finished, I went out every day, when it was fine, and caught\r\nas many fish as I thought I might require, and put them into this\r\nportion of the bathing-pool.  I found the plan answer well, as the fish\r\nlived; but I had great difficulty in getting them out when I wanted\r\nthem; for they would not take the bait.\r\n\r\nAs my birds were no longer a trouble to me, but rather, on the contrary,\r\na profit, I devoted my whole time to my seal.  I required a name for\r\nhim, and reading in the book of Natural History that a certain lion was\r\ncalled Nero, I thought it a very good name for a seal, and bestowed it\r\non him accordingly, although what Nero meant I had no idea of.  The\r\nanimal was now so tame that he would cry if ever I left him, and would\r\nfollow me as far as he could down the rocks; but there was one part of\r\nthe path leading to the bathing-pool, which was too difficult for him,\r\nand there he would remain crying till I came back.  I had more than once\r\ntaken him down to the bathing-pool to wash him, and he was much pleased\r\nwhen I did.  I now resolved that I would clear the path of the rocks,\r\nthat he might be able to follow me down the whole way, for he had grown\r\nso much that I found him too heavy to carry.  It occupied me a week\r\nbefore I could roll away and remove the smaller rocks, and knock off\r\nothers with the axe; but I finished it at last, and was pleased to find\r\nthat the animal followed me right down and plunged into the water.  He\r\nhad not been down since I had made the wall of rock to keep the fish in,\r\nand as soon as he was in, he dived and came out with one of the fish,\r\nwhich he brought to land.  \"So now,\" thought I, \"I shall know how to get\r\nthe fish when I want them--I shall bring you down, Nero.\"  I may as well\r\nhere observe that Nero very soon obeyed orders as faithfully as a dog.\r\nI had a little switch, and when he did wrong, I would give him a slight\r\ntap on the nose.  He would shake his head, show his teeth, and growl,\r\nand then come fondly to me.  As he used to follow me every day down to\r\nthe pool, I had to break him of going after the fish when I did not want\r\nthem taken, and this I accomplished.  No one who had not witnessed it,\r\ncould imagine the affection and docility of this animal, and the love I\r\nhad for him.  He was my companion and playmate during the day, and my\r\nbedfellow at night.  We were inseparable.\r\n\r\nIt was at the latter portion of the second year of my solitude that a\r\ncircumstance occurred, that I must now relate.  Nero had gone down to\r\nthe pool with me, and I was standing fishing off the rocks, when he came\r\nout of the pool and plunged into the sea, playing all sorts of gambols,\r\nand whistling with delight.  I did not think anything about it.  He\r\nplunged and disappeared for a few minutes, and then would come up again\r\nclose to where my line was; but he disturbed the fish, and I could not\r\ncatch any.  To drive him further off, I pelted him with pieces of rock,\r\none of which hit him very hard, and he dived down.  After a time I\r\npulled up my line, and whistling to him to return, although I did not\r\nsee him, I went away to the cabin, fully expecting that he would soon\r\nfollow me, for now he could walk (after his fashion) from the cabin to\r\nthe pool as he pleased.  This was early in the morning, and I busied\r\nmyself with my garden, which was now in great luxuriance, for I had\r\ndressed it with guano; but observing about noon that he had not\r\nreturned, I became uneasy, and went down to the pool to look for him.\r\nHe was not there, and I looked on the sea, but could not perceive him\r\nanywhere.  I called and whistled, but it was of no use, and I grew very\r\nmuch alarmed at the idea that my treasure had deserted me.  \"It could\r\nnot be because I threw the pieces of rock at him,\" thought I; \"he would\r\nnot leave me for that.\"  I remained for two or three hours, watching for\r\nhim, but it was all in vain; there was no seal--no Nero.  My heart sank\r\nat the idea of the animal having deserted me, and for the first time in\r\nmy life, as far as I can recollect, I burst into a flood of tears.  For\r\nthe first time in my life, I may say, I felt truly miserable--my whole\r\nheart and affections were set upon this animal, the companion and friend\r\nof my solitude, and I felt as if existence were a burden without him.\r\nAfter a while, I retraced my steps to the cabin; but I was miserable,\r\nmore so than I can express.  I could not rest quiet.  Two hours before\r\nsunset, I went down again to the rocks, and called till I was hoarse.\r\nIt was all in vain; night closed in, and again I returned to the cabin,\r\nand threw myself down in my bed-place in utter despair.\r\n\r\n\"I thought he loved me,\" said I to myself, \"loved me as I loved him; I\r\nwould not have left him in that way.\"  And my tears burst out anew at\r\nthe idea that I never should see my poor Nero again.\r\n\r\nThe reader may think that my grief was inordinate and unwarrantable; but\r\nlet him put himself in my position--a lad of sixteen, alone on a\r\ndesolate island, with only one companion--true, he was an animal, and\r\ncould not speak, but he was affectionate; he replied to all my caresses;\r\nhe was my only companion and friend, the only object--that I loved or\r\ncared about.  He was intelligent, and I thought loved me as much as I\r\nloved him; and now he had deserted me, and I had nothing else that I\r\ncared about or that cared for me.  My tears flowed for more than an\r\nhour, till at last I was wearied and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the morning, and yet dark, when I felt something touch\r\nme.  I started up--a low cry of pleasure told me at once it was Nero,\r\nwho was by my side.  Yes, it was Nero, who had come back, having climbed\r\nup again the steep path to the cabin, to return to his master.  Need I\r\nsay that I was overjoyed, that I hugged him as if he had been a human\r\nbeing, that I wept over him, and that in a few minutes afterwards we\r\nwere asleep together in the same bed-place?  Such was the fact, and\r\nnever was there in my after-life so great a transition from grief to\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  Now, if you had left me,\"--said I to him, the next morning, when I\r\ngot up; \"you naughty seal, to frighten me and make me so unhappy as you\r\ndid!\"  Nero appeared quite as happy as I was at our re-union, and was\r\nmore affectionate than ever.\r\n\r\nI must now pass over many months in very few words; just stating to the\r\nreader what my position was at the end of three years, during which I\r\nwas alone upon the island.  I had now arrived at the age of near\r\nseventeen, and was tall and strong for my years.  I had left off wearing\r\nmy dress of the skins of birds, having substituted one of the seaman's\r\nshirts, which I had found in the chest.  This, however, was the whole of\r\nmy costume, and although, had it been longer it would have been more\r\ncorrect, still, as I had no other companion but Nero, it was not\r\nnecessary to be so very particular, as if I had been in society.  During\r\nthese three years, I think I had read the Bible and Prayer-book, and my\r\nNatural History book, at least five or six times quite through, and\r\npossessing a retentive memory, could almost repeat them by heart; but\r\nstill I read the Bible as a sealed book, for I did not understand it,\r\nhaving had no one to instruct me, nor any grace bestowed upon me.  I\r\nread for amusement, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nMy garden was now in a most flourishing condition, the climbing plants\r\nhad overrun the cabin, so as to completely cover the whole of the roof\r\nand every portion of it, and they hung in festoons on each side of the\r\ndoorway.  Many of the plants which I had taken up small, when I moved\r\nthem, had proved to be trees, and were now waving to the breeze, high\r\nabove the cabin roof; and everything that I had planted, from continual\r\nwatering and guano, had grown most luxuriantly.  In fact, my cabin was\r\nso covered and sheltered, that its original form had totally\r\ndisappeared; it now looked like an arbour in a clump of trees, and from\r\nthe rocks by the bathing-pool it had a very picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nI had, of course, several times gone up the ravine, and now that my axe\r\nhad become useful, I had gradually accumulated a large stock of wood\r\ndown by the bathing-pool, more than I could use for a long while, as I\r\nseldom lighted a fire; but the cutting it was employment, and employment\r\nwas to me a great source of happiness.  I had been several times to the\r\nother side of the island, and had had more encounters with the seals, of\r\nwhich I killed many, for I found their skins very comfortable and useful\r\nin the cabin.  I had collected about three dozen of the finest skins,\r\nwhich were more than I required, but I had taken them for the same\r\nreason that I had collected the firewood, for the sake of employment;\r\nand in this instance, I may add, for the sake of the excitement which\r\nthe combats with the seals afforded me.\r\n\r\nI have not narrated any of these conflicts, as I thought that they might\r\nweary the reader; I must, however, state what occurred on one occasion,\r\nas although ludicrous, it nearly cost me my life.  I had attacked a\r\nlarge male seal, with a splendid fur, for I always looked out for the\r\nbest-skinned animals.  He was lying on a rock close to the water, and I\r\nhad gone into the water to cut him off and prevent his escape by\r\nplunging in as he would otherwise have done; but as I aimed the usual\r\nblow at his nose, my foot slipped on the wet rock, and I missed the\r\nanimal, and at the same time fell down on the rock with the axe in my\r\nhand.  The animal, which was a male of the largest size, seized hold of\r\nmy shirt (which I then wore) with his teeth, and plunging with me into\r\nthe sea, dived down into the deep water.  It was fortunate that he had\r\nseized my shirt instead of my body, and also that I could swim well.  He\r\ncarried me along with him--the shirt, for a few seconds, drawn over my\r\nhead, when, disembarrassing myself of the garment, by slipping my head\r\nand arms out, I left it in his possession, and regained the surface of\r\nthe water, almost suffocated.  It was fortunate that I did not wear\r\nsleeve-buttons; had I had them, I could not have disengaged myself, and\r\nmust have perished.  I climbed the rock again, and turning round, I\r\nperceived the seal on the surface, shaking the shirt in great wrath.\r\nThis was a sad discomfiture, as I lost not only my shirt but my axe,\r\nwhich I dropped when I was dragged into the water; nothing was saved\r\nexcept my knife, which I carried by a lanyard round my neck.  Why I\r\nmention this circumstance particularly, is, that having felt great\r\ninconvenience for want of sleeve-buttons to hold the wristbands of my\r\nshirt together, I had thought of making use of those of the mate, which\r\nthe reader may recollect had been given with his watch into Jackson's\r\ncare, to take home to his wife; but on second consideration I thought it\r\nvery possible I might lose them, and decided that the property was in\r\ntrust, and that I had no right to risk it.  This correct feeling on my\r\npart, therefore, was probably the saving of my life.\r\n\r\nI have only now to mention my birds, and of them I can merely say that\r\nthey went on as before; they bathed constantly, at the right season they\r\nlaid eggs, the male birds caught fish and brought them to the cabin, and\r\nthey were just as stupid and uninteresting as they were at first;\r\nhowever, they never left me, nor indeed showed any intention to leave\r\nme, after the first season of the birds returning to the island.  They\r\nwere useful but not very ornamental, and not at all interesting to one\r\nwho had such an intelligent companion as Nero.\r\n\r\nHaving new brought up my history, in a few words, until the time\r\nreferred to, I come to the narrative of what occurred to produce a\r\nchange in my condition.  I have said that in the chest there was a\r\nspy-glass, but it had been wetted with salt-water, and was useless.\r\nJackson had tried to show me how to use it, and had shown me correctly,\r\nbut the glasses were dimmed by the wet and subsequent evaporation from\r\nheat.  I had taken out all the glasses and cleaned them, except the\r\nfield-glass, as it is called; but that being composed of two glasses,\r\nthe water had penetrated between them, and it still remained so dull\r\nthat nothing could be distinguished through it, at the time that Jackson\r\nwas showing me how to use the instrument; it was therefore put on one\r\nside as useless.  A year afterwards I took it out, from curiosity, and\r\nthen I discovered that the moisture between the two glasses had been\r\nquite dried up, and that I could see very clearly through it, and after\r\na little practice I could use it as well as anybody else.  Still I\r\nseldom did use it, as my eyesight was particularly keen, and I did not\r\nrequire it; and as for any vessel coming off the island, I had gradually\r\ngiven up all thoughts of it.  It was one evening when the weather was\r\nvery rough and the sea much agitated, that I thought I saw something\r\nunusual on the water, about four miles distant.  I supposed at first it\r\nmight be a spermaceti whale, for numbers used to play round the island\r\nat certain seasons, and I used to watch their blowing and their gambols,\r\nif I may use the term, and Jackson, often told me long stories about the\r\nwhale-fisheries; but a ray of the setting sun made the object appear\r\nwhite, and I ran for the glass, and made out that it was a boat or a\r\nvery small vessel, with a sail out, and running before the gale right\r\ndown to the island.  I watched it till it was dark with much interest,\r\nand with thoughts of various kinds chasing each other; and then I began\r\nto consider what was best to do.  I knew that in an hour the moon would\r\nrise, and as the sky was not cloudy, although the wind and sea were\r\nhigh, I should probably be able to see it again.  \"But they never can\r\nget on shore on this side of the island,\" thought I, \"with so much sea.\r\nYes they might, if they ran for the bathing-pool.\"  After thinking\r\nawhile, I decided that I would go down to the bathing-pool, and place\r\nlighted fagots on the rocks on each side of the entrance, as this would\r\nshow them where to run for, and how to get in.  I waited a little\r\nlonger, and then taking my spy-glass and some tinder with me, I went\r\ndown to the pool, carried two fagots to the rocks on each side, and\r\nhaving set them on fire and taken up others to replace them as soon as\r\nthey were burnt out, I sat down with my spy-glass to see if I could make\r\nout where the boat might be.\r\n\r\nAs the moon rose, I descried her now within a mile of the island, and\r\nher head directed towards the beacon lights made by the burning fagots.\r\nI threw another fagot on each, and went down for a further supply.  The\r\ngale had increased, and the spray now dashed over the rocks to where the\r\nfagots were burning, and threatened to extinguish them, but I put on\r\nmore wood and kept up a fierce blaze.  In a quarter of an hour I could\r\ndistinguish the boat; it was now close to the island, perhaps three\r\nhundred yards distant, steering not directly for the lights, but more\r\nalong shore.  The fact was that they had hauled up, not knowing how they\r\ncould land until they had observed the two lights clear of each other,\r\nand then they understood why they had been made; and a moment afterwards\r\nthey bore up right for the entrance to the bathing-pool, and came\r\nrushing on before the rolling seas.  I still trembled for them, as I\r\nknew that if the sea receded at the time that they came to the ledge of\r\nrocks at the entrance, the boat would be dashed to pieces, although\r\ntheir lives might be saved; but fortunately for them, it was not so--on\r\nthe contrary, they came in borne upon a huge wave which carried them\r\nclear over the ledge, right up to the wall of rock which I had made\r\nacross the pool, and then the boat grounded.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!  Well done, that,\" said a voice from the boat.  \"Lower away the\r\nsail, my lads; all's right.\"\r\n\r\nThe sail was lowered down, and then, by the light of the fire, I\r\ndiscovered that there were several people in the boat.  I had been too\r\nmuch excited to say anything, indeed, I did not know what to say.  I\r\nonly felt that I was no more alone, and the reader may imagine my joy\r\nand delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sail was lowered, the men leaped over the sides of the\r\nboat into the water, and waded to the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" said one of the men, addressing me, \"and how many of you\r\nare there here?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no one on the island but myself,\" replied I; \"but I'm so glad\r\nthat you have come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you?  Then perhaps you'll tell us how to get something to eat, my\r\nhearty?\" replied he.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, wait a little, and I'll bring you plenty,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, look smart, that's a beauty, for we are hungry enough to\r\neat you, if you can find us nothing better.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to go up to the cabin for some birds, when another man\r\ncalled out:--\r\n\r\n\"I say--can you get us any water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, plenty,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I say, Jim, hand us the pail out of the boat.\"\r\n\r\nThe one addressed did so, and the man put it into my hands, saying,\r\n\"Bring us that pail, boy, will you?\"  I hastened up to the cabin, filled\r\nthe pail full of water, and then went for a quantity of dried birds,\r\nwith which I hastened down again to the bathing-pool.  I found the men\r\nhad not been idle; they had taken some fagots off the stack and made a\r\nlarge fire under the rocks, and were then busy making a sort of tent\r\nwith the boat's sails.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the water, and here's some birds,\" said I, as I came up to them.\r\n\r\n\"Birds!  What birds?\" said the man who had first spoken to me, and\r\nappeared to have control over the rest.  He took one up and examined it\r\nby the light of the fire, exclaiming, \"Queer eating, I expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you didn't expect a regular hotel when you landed, did you, mate?\"\r\nsaid one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"No, if I had, I would have called for a glass of grog,\" replied he.  \"I\r\nsuspect I might call a long while before I get any one to bring me one\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nAs I knew that Jackson called the rum by the name of grog, I said,\r\n\"There's plenty of grog, if you want any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there, my hearty,--where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in that cask that's in the water on the other side of your little\r\nship,\" replied I.  \"I can draw you some directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!  In that cask?  Grog floating about in salt-water, that's too\r\nbad.  Come here all of you.  You're in earnest, boy--no joking I hope,\r\nor you may repent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not joking,\" said I--\"there it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe man, followed by all the rest excepting one of the party, waded into\r\nthe water, and went to the cask of rum.\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" said I, \"the spiles are in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I see--never fear, my hearty--come now all of us.\"  So saying, the\r\nwhole of them laid hold of the cask by the chains, and lifting it up,\r\nthey carried it clean out of the water, and placed it on the rocks by\r\nthe side of the pool.\r\n\r\n\"Hand us the little kid out of the boat, Jim,\" said the man; \"we'll soon\r\nsee if it's the right stuff.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out the spiles, drew off some of the liquor, and tasting it,\r\nswore it was excellent.  It was then handed round, and all the men took\r\nsome.\r\n\r\n\"We're in luck to-night; we're fallen upon our legs,\" said the first\r\nman.  \"I say, Jim, put them dried chickens into the pitch-kettle along\r\nwith some taters out of the bag--they'll make a good mess; and then with\r\nthis cask of grog to go to, we shan't do badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, old fellow,\" said he, turning to me, \"you're a regular trump.\r\nWho left you on shore to get all ready for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born here,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Born here!  Well, we'll hear all about that to-morrow--just now, we'll\r\nmake up for lost time, for we've had nothing to eat or drink since\r\nWednesday morning.  Look alive, my lads!  Get up the hurricane-house.\r\nJim, put the pail of water into the kettle, and send the islander here\r\nfor another pailful, for grog.\"\r\n\r\nThe pail was handed to me, and I soon returned with it full; and, as I\r\ndid not see that they had a pannikin, I brought one down and gave it to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fine boy,\" said the mate (as I afterwards found out that he\r\nwas).  \"And now, I say, where do you hold out?  Have you a hut or a cave\r\nto live in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"I have a cabin, but it is not large enough for all of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!  We don't want to go there--we are very well where we are,\r\nalongside of the cask of rum; but you see, my lad, we have a woman\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman!\" said I; \"I never saw a woman.  Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"There she is, sitting by the fire.\"\r\n\r\nI looked round, and perceived that there was one of the party wrapped up\r\nin a blanket, and with a wide straw hat on the head, which completely\r\nconcealed the form from me.  The fact is, that the woman looked like a\r\nbundle, and remained by the fire quite as inanimate.  At my saying that\r\nI never saw a woman, the man burst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Why, did you not say that you were born on this island, boy?\" said the\r\nmate at last.  \"Were you born without a mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot recollect my mother--she died when I was very young; and\r\ntherefore I said that I had never seen a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's explained; but you see, my lad--this is not only a woman,\r\nbut a very particular sort of a woman; and it will not do for her to\r\nremain here after we have had our supper--for after supper, the men may\r\ntake a drop too much, and not behave themselves; so I asked you about\r\nyour cabin, that you might take her there to sleep.  Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"I will take her there if she wishes to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right then; she'll be better there than here, at all events.\r\nI say, boy, where did you leave your trousers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never wear any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, if you have any, I advise you to put them on, for you are\r\nquite old enough to be breeched.\"\r\n\r\nI remained with them while the supper was cooking, asking all manner of\r\nquestions, which caused great mirth.  The pitch-kettle, which was a\r\nlarge iron pot on three short legs, surprised me a good deal; I had\r\nnever seen such a thing before, or anything put on the fire.  I asked\r\nwhat it was, and what it was made of.  The potatoes also astonished me,\r\nas I had never yet seen an edible root.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where have you been all your life?\" said one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"On this island,\" replied I, very naively.\r\n\r\nI waded into the water to examine the boat as well as I could by the\r\nlight of the fire, but I could see little, and was obliged to defer my\r\nexamination till the next day.  Before the supper was cooked and eaten,\r\nI did, however, gain the following information.\r\n\r\nThat they were a portion of the crew of a whaler, which had struck on a\r\nreef of rocks about seventy miles off, and that they had been obliged to\r\nleave her immediately, as she fell on her broadside a few minutes\r\nafterwards; that they had left in two boats, but did not know what had\r\nbecome of the other boat, which parted company during the night.  The\r\ncaptain and six men were in the other boat, and the mate with six men in\r\nthe one which had just landed--besides the lady.\r\n\r\n\"What's a lady?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I mean the woman who sits there; her husband was killed by some of the\r\npeople of the Sandwich Isles, and she was going home to England.  We\r\nhave a consort, another whaler, who was to have taken our cargo of oil\r\non board, and to have gone to England with that and her own cargo, and\r\nthe missionary's wife was to have been sent home in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's a missionary?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't exactly know; but he is a preacher who goes out to teach\r\nthe savages.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the supper was cooked, and the odour from the pitch-kettle\r\nwas more savoury than anything that I had ever yet smelt.  The kettle\r\nwas lifted off the fire, the contents of it poured into a kid, and after\r\nthey had given a portion in the small kid to the woman, who still\r\nremained huddled up in the blanket by the fire, they all sat round the\r\nlarge kid, and commenced their supper.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boy, and join us,\" said the mate, \"you can't have had your\r\nsupper; and as you've found one for us, it's hard but you should share\r\nit with us.\"\r\n\r\nI was not sorry to do as he told me, and I must say that I never enjoyed\r\na repast so much in my life.\r\n\r\n\"I say, boy, have you a good stock of them dried chickens of yours?\"\r\nsaid the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have a great many, but not enough to last long for so many\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but we can get more, can't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied I, \"not until the birds come again, and that will not be\r\nfor these next five moons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five moons!  What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, five full moons must come, one after another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I understand; why then we must not remain on the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied I, \"we must all go, or we shall starve; I am so glad that\r\nyou are come, and the sooner you go the better.  Will you take Nero with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Nero?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nero--my seal--he's very tame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll see about it; at all events,\" said he, turning to the other\r\nmen, \"we must decide upon something, and that quickly, for we shall\r\nstarve if we remain here any time.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared, that they had left the whaler in such a hurry, that they\r\nhad only had time to throw into the boat two breakers of water, four\r\nempty breakers to fill with salt-water for ballast to the boat, and the\r\niron pitch-kettle, with a large sack of potatoes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as supper was finished, they went to the cask for the rum, and\r\nthen the mate said to me:--\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll go and speak to the woman, and you shall take her to sleep in\r\nyour cabin.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time, the woman, as the mate called her, had\r\nnever spoken a word.  She had taken her supper, and eaten it in silence,\r\nstill remaining by the fire, huddled up in the blanket.  On the mate\r\nspeaking to her, she rose up, and I then perceived that she was much\r\ntaller than I thought she could have been; but her Panama hat still\r\nconcealed her face altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, my lad,\" said the mate, \"show the lady where she is to sleep,\r\nand then you can join us again if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you come with me?\" said I, walking away.\r\n\r\nThe woman followed me up the path.  When we arrived at the platform\r\nopposite the cabin, I recollected Nero, whom I had ordered to stay there\r\ntill my return.\r\n\r\n\"You won't be afraid of the seal,\" said I, \"will you?  He is very\r\ngood-natured.  Nero, come here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was rather dark as Nero came shuffling up, and I went forward to coax\r\nhim, for he snarled a little at seeing a stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no light at hand?\" said my companion, speaking for the first\r\ntime, in a very soft yet clear voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not, but I will get some tinder, and make a fire with one of\r\nthe fagots, and then you will be able to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, then, my good lad,\" replied she.\r\n\r\nI thought her voice very pleasing.\r\n\r\nI soon lighted the fagot and enabled her to see Nero (who was now quite\r\nquiet), and also the interior of the cabin.\r\n\r\nShe examined the cabin and the bed-places, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"Where do you sleep?\"\r\n\r\nI replied by showing her my bed-place.  \"And this,\" said I, pointing to\r\nthe one opposite, \"was Jackson's, and you can sleep in that.  Nero\r\nsleeps with me.  Here are plenty of seal-skins to keep you warm, if you\r\nare cold.  Are your clothes wet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are quite dry now,\" replied she; \"if you will get me some\r\nseal-skins, I will lie down on them, for I am very tired.\"\r\n\r\nI spread five or six skins one on the other, in Jackson's bed-place, and\r\nthen I went out and threw another fagot on the fire, that we might have\r\nmore light.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want anything else?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, I thank you.  Are you going to bed now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was meaning to go down again to the men, but now I think of it, I do\r\nnot like to leave you alone with Nero, as he might bite you.  Are you\r\nafraid of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not much afraid, but still I have no wish to be bitten, and I\r\nam not used to sleep with such animals, as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I'll tell you how we'll manage it.  I will take some skins\r\noutside, and sleep there.  Nero will not leave me, and then you won't be\r\nafraid.  The weather is clearing up fast, and there's very little wind\r\nto what there was besides, it will be daylight in three or four hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I took some seal-skins out on the platform, and spreading\r\nthem, I lay down upon them, wishing her good night, and Nero soon joined\r\nme, and we were both fast asleep in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nNero, who was an early riser, woke me up at daybreak, or I should have\r\nslept much longer; for I had been tired out with the fatigue and\r\nexcitement of the night before.  As soon as I was up, I looked into the\r\ncabin, and found the woman was fast asleep; her straw hat was off, but\r\nshe had lain down in her clothes.  Her black hair was hanging about her\r\nshoulders.  Having only seen Jackson with his bushy beard, I had been\r\nsomewhat surprised when I first saw the men on their landing so\r\ncomparatively clear of hair on their face; my astonishment at the clear\r\nwhite skin of a woman--and in this instance, it was peculiarly white and\r\npallid--was very great.  I also perceived how much more delicate her\r\nfeatures were than those of the men; her teeth, too, were very white,\r\nand Jackson's were discoloured and bad; I longed to see her eyes, but\r\nthey were closed.  Any other difference I could not perceive, as she had\r\ndrawn the blanket close up to her chin.\r\n\r\n\"This is then a woman;\" said I to myself: \"yes, and it's very like what\r\nI used to see in my dreams.\"  I looked a little longer, and then,\r\nhearing Nero coming into the cabin behind me, and afraid that she would\r\nawake, I made a hasty retreat.\r\n\r\nI remained at this part of the cabin considering what I should do.  I\r\nthought I would light a fire, and go down for a fish to broil on the\r\nembers for her breakfast, so I called Nero to come down with me.  On\r\narriving at the pool, I found all the seamen fast asleep under the tent\r\nthey had made with the boat's sails; and they appeared to be much the\r\nsame as Jackson used to be after he had got drunk the night before; I\r\npresumed, therefore, that such was their state, and was not far wrong.\r\nNero went into the pool and brought out a fish, as I ordered him, and I\r\nthen walked to the boat to examine it.  This took me half an hour, and I\r\nwas sorry that none of the men were awake, that so I might ask any\r\nquestions I wished.  I examined the pitch-kettle, and the boat's sails,\r\nand the breakers.  Breakers are small casks, holding about six to seven\r\ngallons of water, and are very handy for boats.  I remained about an\r\nhour, and then went back to the cabin, carrying a fagot on my shoulder,\r\nNero following with the fish in his mouth.  We were met by the woman,\r\nwho came out of the cabin; she no longer had the blanket round her, for\r\nit was a beautiful bright morning, and very warm.\r\n\r\n\"Nero is bringing you your breakfast,\" said I, \"so you ought to like\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say I shall, if we are to be companions in future,\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want anything?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a little water, if you can get me some.\"\r\n\r\nI filled the kid from the spring, put it down by her, and then took out\r\nthe inside of the fish, and fed the birds, who were crowding round me.\r\n\r\nThe woman washed her face and hands, braided up her hair, and then sat\r\ndown on the rock.  In the mean time, I had lighted my fagot, cleaned the\r\nfish, and waited till the wood was burnt to ashes before I put the fish\r\non the fire.  Having then nothing to do, I thought that reading would\r\namuse the woman, and I went in for the Bible.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I read to you?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied she with some astonishment in her looks.\r\n\r\nI read to her the history of Joseph and his brethren, which was my\r\nfavourite story in the Bible.\r\n\r\n\"Who taught you to read?\" said she, as I shut the book, and put the fish\r\non the embers.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"He was a good man, was he not?\" replied she.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.  \"No, not very good,\" said I, at last.  \"If you knew\r\nall about him, you would say the same; but he taught me to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been on this island?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I was born on it, but my father and mother are both dead, and Jackson\r\ndied three years ago--since that I have been quite alone, only Nero with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nShe then asked me a great many more questions, and I gave her a short\r\nnarration of what had passed, and what Jackson had told me; I also\r\ninformed her how it was I procured food, and how we must soon leave the\r\nisland, now that we were so many, or the food would not last out till\r\nthe birds came again.\r\n\r\nBy this time the fish was cooked, and I took it off the fire and put it\r\ninto the kid, and we sat down to breakfast; in an hour or so we had\r\nbecome very sociable.\r\n\r\nI must, however, now stop a little to describe her.  What the men had\r\ntold me was quite true.  She had lost her husband, and was intending to\r\nproceed to England.  Her name was Reichardt, for her husband was a\r\nGerman, or of German family.  She was, as I have since ascertained,\r\nabout thirty-seven years old, and very tall and elegant; she must have\r\nbeen very handsome when she was younger, but she had suffered much\r\nhardship in following her husband as she had done, through all the\r\nvicissitudes of his travels.\r\n\r\nHer face was oval; eyes black and large; and her hair black as the\r\nraven's wing; her features were small and regular; her teeth white and\r\ngood; but her complexion was very pallid, and not a vestige of colour on\r\nher cheeks.  As I have since thought, it was more like a marble statue\r\nthan anything I can compare her to.  There was a degree of severity in\r\nher countenance when she did not smile, and it was seldom that she did.\r\nI certainly looked upon her with more awe than regard, for some time\r\nafter I became acquainted with her; and yet her voice was soft and\r\npleasant, and her manners very amiable; but it must be remembered I had\r\nnever before seen a woman.  After breakfast was over, I proposed going\r\ndown to where the seamen lay, to see if they were awake; but I told her\r\nI thought that they would not be.\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you, as I left a basket with some things of mine in the\r\nboat, and it will be as well to bring them up at once.\"\r\n\r\nWe therefore set off together, I having ordered Nero to stay in the\r\ncabin.  On our arrival at the pool, we found the men still fast asleep;\r\nand by her directions I went into the water to the boat, and brought out\r\na basket and a small bundle which she pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I wake them?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied she; \"so long as they sleep, they will be doing no\r\nharm.  But,\" said she, \"we may as well take some potatoes up with us;\r\nfill both these handkerchiefs,\" continued she, taking two out of the\r\nbundle.  I did so, and she took one and I the other, and we returned to\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Are these all the birds that you have for food?\" said she, looking at\r\nthe pile in the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.  \"But what are we to do with the potatoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can roast them by the fire if we like,\" said she; \"but at present we\r\nhad better take them into the cabin.  Did you plant all these flowers\r\nand creepers which grow over the cabin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.  \"I was alone and had nothing to do, so I thought I\r\nwould make a garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very pretty.  Now that I am back, you can go down to the men\r\nif you please, and tell them, when they wake up, that I wish to have the\r\nsmallest of the boat's sails, to make a screen of.  Tell the mate--he is\r\nthe most civil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said I.  \"Is there anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, bring up a few more potatoes; they will let you take them if you\r\nsay that I told you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I take Nero with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do not want his company, for I am a little afraid of him.\"\r\n\r\nI called Nero, who came after me, and went down to the pool, when I\r\nfound that the men had all woke up, and were very busy, some lighting a\r\nfire, some washing potatoes, and some trying to catch the fish in the\r\npool.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, here he is.  Come, boy, what have you got for our breakfast?  We've\r\nbeen trying to catch some of these fish, but they're as quick as eels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nero will soon catch you what you want,\" replied I.  \"Here, Nero, in.\"\r\n\r\nNero plunged in, and soon brought out a fish, and I then sent him in for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, lad,\" said the mate, \"that will be enough for our breakfast.\r\nThat seal of yours is a handy fellow, and well trained.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the other men were getting breakfast, one of them went up to Nero,\r\nI believe with the intention of making friends with him, but Nero\r\nrejected his advances, and showed his sharp teeth, snapping at him\r\nseveral times.  The man became angry, and caught up a piece of rock to\r\nthrow at the seal.  He aimed at the animal's nose, and narrowly missed\r\nhitting it.  Had he done so, he would probably have killed it.  This\r\nmade me very angry, and I told the man not to do so again; upon this, he\r\ncaught up another, and was about to throw it, when I seized him by the\r\ncollar with my left hand, and with my right drawing my American knife, I\r\nthreatened to stab him with it, if he attacked the beast.  The man\r\nstarted back, and in so doing, fell over a piece of rock, on his back.\r\nThis quarrel brought the mate to us, along with two or three of the men.\r\nMy knife was still lifted up, when the mate said:\r\n\r\n\"Come, my hearty, no knives, we don't allow them.  That's not English.\r\nPut it up; no one shall hurt the beast, I promise you.  Bob, you fool,\r\nwhy couldn't you leave the animal alone?  You forget you are among\r\nsavages here.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the other men burst out into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" observed one; \"I can swear, when I get back, that the natives of\r\nthis island are savages, who eat raw flesh, have seals for playmates,\r\nand don't wear clothes enough for common decency?\"\r\n\r\nThis made them laugh more, and the man who had attacked Nero, and who\r\nhad got upon his legs again, joined with the others; so all was again\r\ngood humour.  The men sat down to their breakfast, while I examined the\r\nboat again, and afterwards asked many questions, with which they were\r\nmuch amused, every now and then observing, \"Well, he is a savage!\"\r\n\r\nAfter they had breakfasted, I made Nero catch another fish, and sent him\r\nup to the cabin with it, as I was afraid that the man might do him an\r\ninjury, and then told the mate that the woman had desired me to bring up\r\nsome potatoes.\r\n\r\n\"Take them,\" said he; \"but you have nothing to carry them up with.\r\nHere, fill the pail, and I will go to the cabin with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me that I was to ask you for a small boat's sail, to hang up\r\nas a screen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, she shall have the boat's mizen.  We don't want it.  I'll carry\r\nit up.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate threw the sail and yard over his shoulder, and followed me up\r\nto the cabin.  On our arrival, we found the missionary's wife sitting on\r\nthe platform, Nero lying not far from her, with the fish beside him.\r\nThe mate took off his hat, and saluted my new companion, saying, that he\r\nhoped she was comfortable last night.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied she, \"as much so as I could expect; but I turned this\r\ngood lad out of his cabin, which I do not wish to do again, and\r\ntherefore I requested the sail for a screen.  Now, John Gough, what do\r\nyou intend to do?\" continued she.\r\n\r\nThe mate replied, \"I came up here to see what quantity of provision the\r\nlad might have.  By his account, it will not last more than a month, and\r\nit will take some time before we can reach where we are likely to fall\r\nin with any vessel.  Stay here we cannot, for we shall only eat the\r\nprovision and lose time; therefore the sooner we are off the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you take all the provision, of course you will take the lad with\r\nyou?\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my chest, and my seal?\" inquired I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your chest, certainly; but as for your seal, I do not know what to\r\nsay to that--he will be starved in the boat, and if you give him his\r\nliberty, he will do well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say is very true,\" replied the woman.  \"I am afraid, boy, that\r\nyou will have to part with your friend.  It will be better for both of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI made no reply; for it cut me to the heart to think of parting with\r\nNero; but still I had sense enough to perceive that what they said was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe mate then went into the cabin, and examined the heap of dried birds\r\nwhich I had collected, and having made his calculation, said that there\r\nwere sufficient for three weeks, but not more.\r\n\r\n\"And when do you think of leaving this island?\" inquired the woman.\r\n\r\n\"The day after to-morrow, if I can persuade the men, madam,\" replied he;\r\n\"but you know they are not very easy to manage, and very thoughtless,\r\nespecially now that they have so unexpectedly fallen in with liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I admit,\" replied she; \"but as they will probably take the liquor\r\nin the boat, that will not make so great a difference.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go down and speak to them, now they're all sober,\" replied the\r\nmate, \"and will let you know in the evening; or to-morrow morning\r\nperhaps, will be better.\"  The mate then saluted her, by touching his\r\nhat, and left us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing which had made a great impression on me in the\r\nconversation with the men in the morning.  They called me a savage, and\r\nsaid that I had not sufficient clothes on; and as I observed that they\r\nwere all dressed in jackets and trousers, which covered them from head\r\nto foot, I took it for granted that my shirt, which was all that I wore,\r\nwas not a sufficient clothing.  This had never occurred to me before,\r\nnor can the reader be surprised at it.  I had been like our first\r\nparents in Eden--naked but not ashamed; but now that I had suddenly come\r\nin contact with my fellow-men, I felt as if something were amiss.  The\r\nconsequence was, that I went to the chest and got out a pair of white\r\ntrousers, and put them on.  I thought them very uncomfortable and very\r\nunnecessary articles; but others--wore them, and I felt that I must do\r\nso also.  They were rather long for me, but I rolled up the bottoms of\r\nthe legs, as I observed that the seamen did, and then came out on the\r\nplatform, where the missionary's wife was still seated, looking out upon\r\nthe waves as they lashed the rocks.  She immediately observed the\r\naddition that I had made to my dress, and said--\r\n\r\n\"That is a great improvement.  Now you look like other people.  What is\r\nyour name?  You have not told me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had answered the question, I said to her--\r\n\r\n\"I have brought up more of the potatoes, as you call them; what am I to\r\ndo with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"First tell me, have you any spot that you know about the island where\r\nthere is mould--that is, earth, like you have in your garden--where we\r\ncan plant them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I, \"there is some up there;\" and I pointed to one-third\r\nup the ravine.  \"I brought all this earth from there, and there is\r\nplenty of it; but what is the good of planting them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said she, \"one of the potatoes planted will, in a very short\r\ntime, grow, and then it will produce perhaps thirty or forty potatoes at\r\nits roots as large as these; they are excellent things for food, and\r\nwhere there is nothing else to be had, may be the means of preserving\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that may be,\" replied I, \"and if we were going to remain on the\r\nisland, it would be well to plant them; but as we are going away the day\r\nafter to-morrow, what's the use of it?  I know that they are very nice,\r\nfor I had some for supper last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are we only to think of ourselves in this world, and not of\r\nothers?\" replied she, \"Suppose, two or three years hence, another boat\r\nwere to be cast away on this island, and not find, as we have, you here,\r\nwith provisions ready for them, they would starve miserably; whereas, if\r\nwe plant these potatoes, they may find plenty of food and be saved.\r\nOnly think how glad your father and mother would have been to have found\r\npotatoes on the island when they were thrown on it.  We must not live\r\nonly for ourselves, but we must think and try to do good to others--that\r\nis the duty of a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are very right,\" replied I, \"and a very kind person too.\r\nIf you wish it, I will go and plant the potatoes this day.  How am I to\r\nplant them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a shovel in the boat,\" said she, \"for I saw them throwing the\r\nwater out with it.  Go down and get it, and then I will go with you and\r\nshow you.\"\r\n\r\nI went down and the mate gave me the shovel, which I carried up to her.\r\nI found her cutting the potatoes into pieces, and she showed me how she\r\ncut them, leaving an eye in each piece, and explained the reason for it.\r\nI was soon very busy cutting away alongside of her, and before long the\r\npail of potatoes was all ready to be planted.\r\n\r\nWe then walked to the ravine, and she showed me how to use the shovel,\r\nand I made the holes.  Before noon we had planted all that we had cut,\r\nbut we had still the two handkerchiefs full that we had at first brought\r\nup with us.  We returned to the cabin, and I prepared the fish for\r\ndinner.  After it was on the embers, she wished to have the screen put\r\nup beside her bed-place.\r\n\r\n\"Go down to the mate,\" said she, \"and ask him for the hammer and three\r\nor four nails.  I know they have them in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may as well take them down some birds for their dinner,\" replied I,\r\n\"for, they will want them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do so; and then come back to me as soon as you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate gave me the hammer, an article I had never seen before, and\r\nfive or six nails, with which I returned to the cabin, and nailed up the\r\nsail as a screen.\r\n\r\n\"Now you will be able to sleep in your own bed-place to-night,\" said\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nI made no reply; but I could not imagine why I could not have done so\r\nthe night before, for I had only gone out of the cabin that she might\r\nnot be frightened by Nero being so close to her.\r\n\r\nAfter we had eaten our dinner, she said to me--\r\n\r\n\"How could you contrive to live on this island, if you had no dried\r\nbirds?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" replied I; \"why very badly.  I might catch fish; but there are\r\ntimes in the year when you can catch no fish, they won't take bait,\r\nneither will they when the weather is rough.  Besides, I have only two\r\nlines, and I might lose them both--then what would become of me?  I\r\nshould starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you see under all circumstances, it was just as well to\r\nplant the potatoes, for other people may come here and be in your\r\nposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is true, but we shall not be here long now, and you don't\r\nknow how glad I am to go.  I want to see all the things that I have read\r\nabout in my books.  I want to go to England and look for somebody; but\r\nyou don't know all that I know; some day I will tell you all--\r\neverything.  I am so tired of living here by myself--nothing to say--no\r\none to talk to--no one to care for, except Nero, and he can't speak.  I\r\ncan't bear the idea of parting with him, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you rather stay on the island with Nero, than go away without\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied I; \"go I must, but still I do not like to part with him.\r\nHe is the only friend that I ever had, that I can remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you have lived longer, and mixed more with the world, my poor boy,\r\nyou will then find how many sacrifices you will be obliged to make, much\r\nmore serious than parting with an animal that you are attached to.  I\r\nsuppose you expect to be very happy if ever you get back to England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do; why should I not be?\" replied I; \"I shall be always\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nThe missionary's wife shook her head.  \"I fear not.  Indeed, I think if\r\nyou live long enough, you will acknowledge that the happiest of your\r\ndays were passed on this barren rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jackson said otherwise,\" replied I.  \"He was always grieving at being\r\non the island, and not able to get back to England; and he told me so\r\nmany stories about England, and what is done there and what a beautiful\r\nplace it is, that I'm sure I shall like it better than being here, even\r\nif I had somebody with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are in the hands of God, and you must put your trust in him.\r\nHe will do with you as he thinks best for you--that you know, as you\r\nread your Bible.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't know that,\" replied I.  \"God lives beyond the stars, a\r\nlong way off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you have gained by reading your Bible?\" inquired she,\r\nlooking me in the face.\r\n\r\n\"No, not all,\" replied I; \"but I do not understand a great deal that I\r\nread; I want some one to tell me.  I am so glad you came with the men in\r\nthe boat, for I never saw a woman before.  I used to see somebody in my\r\ndreams, and now I know it was a woman.  It was my mother; but I have not\r\nseen her for a long while now, and I have nobody but Nero.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor boy, you have a father in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"I know he is in heaven, and so is my mother; for\r\nJackson said that they were both very good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean your Heavenly Father, God.  Do you not say in the Lord's Prayer,\r\n`Our Father which art in heaven?'  You must love him.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to reply, when John Gough, the mate, came up, and told my\r\ncompanion, that he had been speaking to the men, and they had agreed\r\nthat the day after the next they would, if the weather permitted, leave\r\nthe island; that they had examined the boat, and found it required very\r\nlittle repair, and that all would be ready the next day.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that they will not overload the boat,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that they will, but I must do all I can to prevent it.  The cask\r\nof rum was rather an unfortunate discovery, and we had been better\r\nwithout it.  Leave it they will not, so we must put out of the boat all\r\nthat we can possibly do without, for we shall be nine of us, and that\r\nwill be plenty of weight with the addition of the cask.\"\r\n\r\n\"You promised to take my chest, you remember,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will do so if I possibly can; but recollect, I may not be able\r\nto keep my promise; for now that they have the liquor, the men do not\r\nobey me as they did before, ma'am,\" said the mate.  \"Perhaps he had\r\nbetter take the best of his clothes in a bundle, in case they should\r\nrefuse to take in the chest; and I must say, that, loaded as the boat\r\nwill be, they will be much to blame if they do not refuse, for the boat\r\nis but small for stowage, and there's all the provisions to put in her,\r\nwhich will take up a deal of room.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true,\" replied the woman.  \"It will be better to leave the\r\nchest here, for I do not think that the boat will hold it.  You must not\r\nmind your chest, my good boy, it is of no great value.\"\r\n\r\n\"They take my rum and all my birds, and they ought to take both me and\r\nmy chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if it takes up too much room,\" replied the woman.  \"You cannot\r\nexpect it.  The wishes of one person must give way to the wishes of\r\nmany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they would have starved if it had not been for me,\" replied I,\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\"That's very true, boy,\" replied the mate; \"but you have to learn yet,\r\nthat might is right; and recollect that what you did this morning has\r\nnot made you any great favourite with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\" inquired my companion.\r\n\r\n\"Only that he nearly drove his knife through one of the men, that's\r\nall,\" replied the mate; \"English sailors ar'n't fond of knives.\"\r\n\r\nHe then touched his hat, and went down again to the pool, desiring me to\r\nfollow him with a kid for our share of the supper.  I did so, and on my\r\nreturn she asked me why I had drawn my knife upon the seaman, and I\r\nnarrated how it occurred.  She pointed out to me the impropriety of what\r\nI had done, asking me whether the Bible did not tell us we were to\r\nforgive injuries.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"but is it not injuries to ourselves?  I did forgive\r\nJackson; but this was to prevent his hurting another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another!  Why you talk of Nero as if the animal was a rational being,\r\nand his life of as much consequence as that of a fellow-creature.  I do\r\nnot mean to say but that the man was very wrong, and that you must have\r\nfelt angry if an animal you were so fond of had been killed; but there\r\nis a great difference between the life of an animal and that of a\r\nfellow-creature.  The animal dies, and there is an end of it; but a man\r\nhas an immortal soul, which never perishes, and nothing can excuse your\r\ntaking the life of a man, except in self-defence.  Does not the\r\ncommandment say, `Thou shalt not kill?'\"\r\n\r\nShe then talked to me a long while upon the subject, and fully made me\r\nunderstand that I had been very wrong, and I confessed that I had been\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nI now resolved to speak to her relative to the belt which contained the\r\ndiamonds; and I was first obliged to narrate to her in a few words what\r\nJackson had told me.  She heard me with great interest, now and then\r\nasking a question.  When I had told her all, I said--\r\n\r\n\"Now, as they talk of not taking my chest, what shall I do?  Shall I\r\nwear the belt myself, or shall I put it in the bundle?  Or will you wear\r\nit for me, as my mother would have done, if she had been alive?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply for some time, at last she said, as if talking to\r\nherself, and not to me--\r\n\r\n\"How unsearchable are thy ways, O God!\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, although I did not feel it at the time, I have afterwards\r\nthought, and she told me herself, how great her surprise was at finding\r\nin the unshorn little savage, thus living alone upon a desolate rock, a\r\nlad of good birth, and although he did not know it, with a fortune in\r\nhis charge, which would, in all probability, be ultimately his own.\r\nThis is certain, that the interest she felt towards me increased every\r\nhour, as by degrees I disclosed my history.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied she, \"if you will trust me, I will take charge of your\r\nbelt.  To-morrow we will select out of the chest what will be best to\r\ntake with you, and then we will arrange as you wish.\"\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour's more conversation, she went into the cabin, and\r\nretired behind the screen which had been fixed up, telling me that she\r\ndid not mind Nero, and that I might go to bed when I pleased.  As I was\r\nnot much inclined to go down to the seamen, I followed her advice and\r\nwent to bed; but I could not sleep for a long time from the noise which\r\nthe men made, who were carousing at the bathing-pool.  The idea of\r\nparting with Nero also lay heavy upon my heart, though the woman had\r\nalmost satisfied me that as soon as I was gone, the animal would resume\r\nits natural habits, and care nothing for me.\r\n\r\nI was up the next morning early, and went down with Nero to obtain the\r\nfish which we required.  I left some on the rocks for the seamen's\r\nbreakfast (for they were all sound asleep), and then returned to the\r\ncabin, and prepared for our own.  Mrs Reichardt, as I shall now call\r\nher, soon came out to me, and when breakfast was over, proposed that we\r\nshould plant the remainder of the potatoes, before we packed up the\r\nthings in the chest.  As soon as they were all cut, we set off to the\r\nravine, and had finished our task before noon, at which time there were\r\nbut few of the seamen stirring, they had remained up so long the night\r\nbefore, drinking.  The mate was one of those who were on their legs, and\r\nhe asked me if I thought we should have smooth water to launch the boat\r\non the following day.  I replied in the affirmative, and went with Mrs\r\nReichardt to the cabin, and putting down the shovel, I hauled my chest\r\nout on the platform to select what articles I should take.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus employed, and talking at times, the men came up for\r\nthe dried birds to take down ready for putting them in the boat on the\r\nfollowing day, and in two trips they had cleared out the whole of them.\r\n\r\n\"Have you used all the potatoes you brought up?\" said one of the men;\r\n\"for we shall be short of provisions.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt replied that we had none left.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said the man, \"the mate says you had better bring down that\r\nbrute of yours to catch the rest of the fish in the pond, that we may\r\ncook them before we start, as they will make two days' meals at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied I; \"I will come down directly.\"  I did so, and\r\nNero, in a quarter of an hour, had landed all the fish, and I then\r\nreturned with him to the cabin.  Mrs R had selected the best of the\r\nclothes, and made them up in a tight bundle, which she sewed up with\r\nstrong thread.  My books she had left out, as well as the spy-glass, and\r\nthe tools I had, as they might be useful.  I asked her whether I should\r\ncarry them down to the bathing-pool, but she replied that on the morning\r\nwhen we embarked would be quite time enough.  I then went to the hole\r\nunder Jackson's bed-place, and brought out the belt and the few articles\r\nthat were with it.  Mrs R, after having examined them, said that she\r\nwould take care of them all; the watch and other trinkets she put in her\r\nbasket; the belt she took to the bed-place, and secreted it.\r\n\r\nShe appeared very silent and thoughtful, and on my asking her whether I\r\nshould not take down the shovel, and the pail, and hammer, she replied,\r\n\"No, leave all till we are ready to go to the boat.  It will be time\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, the mate brought us up some of the fish which they\r\nhad cooked for supper, and when we had eaten it we went to bed.\r\n\r\n\"This is the last night we shall sleep together, Nero,\" said I, kissing\r\nmy favourite, and the thought brought tears into my eyes.  \"But it can't\r\nbe helped.\"  I was, however, soon fast asleep, with my arm round the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nWhen I went out the next morning, I found that the weather was\r\nbeautifully fine, the water smooth, and only rippled by a light breeze.\r\nAs Mrs R had not yet made her appearance, I went down to the\r\nbathing-pool, where I found all the men up and in full activity.  The\r\nboat had been emptied out, the oars, masts, and sails, were on the\r\nrocks; and the men were turning the bows to the seaward in readiness for\r\nlaunching her over the ledge of rocks.  The dried birds lay in a heap by\r\nthe side of the cask of rum, and the fish which had been baked were in\r\nthe large kid.  The six breakers were also piled up together, and the\r\nmate and some of the men were disputing as to how many of them should be\r\nfilled with water.  The mate wanted them all filled; the men said that\r\nthree would be sufficient, as the boat would be so loaded.  At last the\r\nmate gained his point, and the men each took a breaker, and went up to\r\nthe cabin for the water.  I went with them to fill the breakers, and\r\nalso to see that they did no mischief, for they appeared very unruly and\r\nout of temper; and I was afraid that they would hurt Nero, who was at\r\nthe cabin, if I was not there to prevent them; but with the exception of\r\nexamining the cabin, and forcing themselves in upon Mrs Reichardt, they\r\ndid nothing.  When the breakers were full, which took at least half an\r\nhour, they did indeed try to catch the birds, and would have wrung their\r\nnecks, but the males flew away, and the females I put into the bed-place\r\nthat was screened off in the cabin, and near which Mrs Reichardt was\r\nsitting.  They all appeared to have a great awe and respect for this\r\nwoman, and a look from her was more effectual than were any words of the\r\nmate.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want you,\" said one of the men, as they went down to the\r\nbathing-pool with the breakers on their shoulders.  \"Why don't you keep\r\nup with the lady?  You're quite a lady's man, now you've white trousers\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nThe others who followed him laughed at this latter remark.\r\n\r\n\"I'm of no use up there, at present,\" said I; \"and I may be down below.\"\r\n\r\nThe men set down the breakers on the rocks by the pool, and then, under\r\nthe directions of the mate, prepared to launch the boat over the ledge.\r\nThe masts of the boat were placed athwartships, under her keel, for her\r\nto run upon, and being now quite empty, she was very light.  She was\r\nwhat they call a whale-boat, fitted for the whale-fishery, pointed at\r\nboth ends, and steered by an oar; she was not very large, but held seven\r\npeople comfortably, and she was remarkably well fitted with sails and\r\nmasts, having two lugs and a mizen.  As soon as they were all ready, the\r\nmen went to the side of the boat, and in a minute she was launched into\r\nthe sea without injury.  The mate said to me, as they brought her\r\nbroadside to the ledge:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my lad, we don't want you any more; you may go up to the cabin\r\ntill we are ready, and then we will send for you and the lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  But I can be of use here,\" replied I; \"and I am of none up there.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate did not reply, and the men then went to the rum-cask, and\r\nrolled it towards the boat; and when they had it on the ledge, they\r\nparbuckled it, as they term it, into the boat with a whale-line that\r\nthey happened to have, and which was of great length.  After the cask of\r\nrum was got in amidships (and it took up a great deal of space, reaching\r\nfrom one gunwale to the other, and standing high above the thwarts),\r\nthey went for the breakers of water, which they put in, three before and\r\nthree behind the cask, upon the floor of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"She will be too heavy,\" said one of the men, \"with so much water.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can easily get rid of it,\" replied the mate.  \"If you had said she\r\nwould be too heavy with so much liquor on board, you had better\r\nexplained the matter; however, you must have your own ways, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nThe next articles that they brought to stow away were the provisions.\r\nThe kid of fish was put amidships on the breakers, and the dried bird;\r\nwhich they carried down in their arms, were packed up neatly in the\r\nstern-sheets.  They were soon up to the gunwale, and the mate said:\r\n\r\n\"You had better stow away forward now--there will be little room for the\r\nlady as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, stow them all aft,\" replied one of the men, in a surly tone;\r\n\"the lady must sit where she can.  She's no better than we.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall this go in?\" said I, pointing to the coil of whale-line, and\r\naddressing the mate.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; we must leave that,\" replied one of the men in the boat; \"we\r\nshall be wedged enough as it is; and I say, Jim, throw that old saw and\r\nthe bag of nails out of the boat--we can have no use for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe masts were then stepped, and the rigging set up to the gunnel of the\r\nboat, the yards and sails handed in, and hooked on the halyards ready\r\nfor hoisting.  In fact the boat was now all ready for starting; they had\r\nonly the iron kettle and two or three other articles to put in.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we have the mizen?\" inquired one of the men, pointing to the\r\nmast, which lay on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"No, she steers quite as well without it,\" replied the mate.  \"We'll\r\nleave it.  And now, lad; hand the oars in.\"\r\n\r\nThey were brought to the boat, but owing to the puncheon of rum in the\r\ncentre, they could not lie flat, and after a good deal of arguing and\r\ndisputing, four oars and a boat-hook were lashed to the gunnel outside,\r\nand the rest were left on the rocks.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was some consultation between the mate and some of\r\nthe men--the mate being evidently opposed by the others.  I could not\r\nhear what it was about, but the mate appeared very angry and very much\r\nannoyed.  At last he dashed his hat down on the rocks in a great\r\npassion, saying:\r\n\r\n\"No good will come of it.  Mark my words.  No good ever did or ever\r\nwill.  Be it so, you are too many for me; but I tell you again, no good\r\nwill come of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe mate then sat down on the rocks by himself, and put his head down on\r\nhis knees, covering it with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe man with whom he had been disputing went to the others in the boat,\r\nand spoke to them in a low tone, looking round at me, to ascertain if I\r\nwas within hearing.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two they all separated, and then one of them said to\r\nme--\"Now, my lad, we're all ready.  Go up to the cabin and bring down\r\nyour bundle and her basket, and tell the lady we are waiting for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the shovel,\" said I, \"and the boat's sail--must I bring them\r\ndown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, bring them down, and also two or three seal-skins for the lady\r\nto sit upon.\"\r\n\r\nOff I went on my errand, for I was delighted with the idea of leaving\r\nthe island, and my patience had been almost exhausted at the time they\r\nhad taken in the stowage of the boat.  As I hastened up the path, I\r\nheard loud contention, and the mate's voice speaking very angrily, and I\r\nstopped for a short time to listen, but the noise ceased, and I went on\r\nagain.  I found Nero on the platform, and I stopped a minute to caress\r\nhim.  \"Good-bye, my poor Nero, we shall never see one another again,\"\r\nsaid I.  \"You must go back to the sea, and catch fish for yourself;\" and\r\nthe tears started in my eyes as I gave the animal a farewell kiss.\r\n\r\nI then went into the cabin, where I found Mrs Reichardt sitting very\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"They are all ready,\" said I, \"and have sent me up for you; but I am to\r\nbring down the boat's sail and some seal-skins for you to sit upon.  I\r\ncan carry both if you can carry my bundle.  Have you put the belt on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied she, \"I am quite ready.  I will carry the bundle, and the\r\nbooks and spy-glass, as well as my basket; but we must pack them close,\"\r\nadded she, \"and roll the sail up round the yard, or you will not be able\r\nto carry it.\"\r\n\r\nWe took the sail down, and got it ready for carrying, and I rolled up\r\nthe two best seal-skins, and tied them with a piece of fishing-line, and\r\nthen we were all ready.  I shouldered my burden, and Mrs Reichardt took\r\nthe other articles, as proposed, and we left the cabin to go down the\r\npath to the bathing-pool.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Nero--good-bye, birds--good-bye, cabin--and good-bye,\r\ngarden,\" said I, as I went along the platform; and having so done, and\r\nordered Nero back with a tremulous voice, I turned my head in the\r\ndirection of the bathing-pool.  I stared and then screamed, dropping my\r\nburden, as I lifted up my hands in amazement--\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" cried I to my companion.  \"Look!\" repeated I, breathless.\r\n\r\nShe did look, and saw as I did--the boat under all sail, half a mile\r\nfrom the pool, staggering under a fresh breeze, which carried her away\r\nat the rate of seven or eight miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThey had left us--they had deserted us.  I cried out, like a madman,\r\n\"Stop!  Stop!  Stop!\" and then, seeing how useless it was, I dashed\r\nmyself on the rock, and for a minute or two was insensible.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" groaned I, at last, as I came to my senses.\r\n\r\n\"Frank Henniker,\" said a sweet firm voice.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes, and saw Mrs Reichardt standing by me.\r\n\r\n\"It is the will of Heaven, and you must submit to it patiently,\"\r\ncontinued she.\r\n\r\n\"But so cruel, so treacherous!\" replied I, looking at the fast-receding\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\"I grant, most cruel, and most treacherous; but we must leave them to\r\nthe judgment of God.  What can they expect from Him in the way of mercy\r\nwhen they have shown none?  I tell you candidly, that I think we are\r\nbetter in our present forlorn state upon this rock, than if in that\r\nboat.  They have taken with them the seeds of discord, of recklessness,\r\nand intemperance, in an attempt which requires the greatest prudence,\r\ncalmness, and unanimity, and I fear there is little chance of their ever\r\nbeing rescued from their dangerous position.  It is my opinion, and I\r\nthought so when I first knew they had found the cask, that liquor would\r\nprove their ruin, and I say again, that boat will never arrive at its\r\ndestination, and they will all perish miserably.  It has pleased God\r\nthat they should leave us here, and depend upon it, it has been so\r\ndecided for the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" replied I, looking again at the boat, \"I was tired of being\r\nhere--I was so anxious to get off--and now to be left!  And they have\r\ntaken all our provisions, everything, even the fish in the pool.  We\r\nshall starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" replied she, \"and I think not; but we must exert\r\nourselves, and trust to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nBut I could not heed her--my heart was bursting.  I sobbed, as I sat\r\nwith my hands covering up my face.\r\n\r\n\"All gone;\" cried I.  \"No one left but you and I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied she, \"one more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" cried I, looking up.\r\n\r\n\"God!--who is with us always.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nI heard what she said, but my head was too confused to weigh the words.\r\nI remained silent, where I was.  A few seconds elapsed, and she spoke\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\"Frank Henniker, rise, and listen to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall starve,\" muttered I.\r\n\r\nAs I said this, one of the male birds returned from the sea with a large\r\nfish, of which Mrs Reichardt took possession, as she had seen me do,\r\nand the gannet flew away again to obtain more.  Immediately afterwards,\r\nthe other two birds returned with fish, which were in the like way\r\nsecured by my companion.\r\n\r\n\"See how unjust and ungrateful you are,\" observed she.  \"Here are the\r\nbirds feeding us, as the ravens did Elijah in the wilderness, at the\r\nvery time that you are doubting the goodness and mercy of God.  There is\r\na meal for us provided already.\"\r\n\r\n\"My head!  My head!\" exclaimed I, \"it is bursting, and there is a heavy\r\nweight rolling in it--I cannot see anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd such was the fact: the excitement had brought on a determination of\r\nblood to the head, and my senses were rapidly departing.  Mrs Reichardt\r\nknelt by my side, and perceiving that what I had said was the case, went\r\ninto the cabin and brought out a cloth, which she wetted with water from\r\nthe spring, and laid across my forehead and temples.  I remained\r\nmotionless and nearly senseless for half an hour, during which, she\r\ncontinued to apply fresh cold water to the cloth, and by degrees I\r\nrecovered from my stupor.  In the mean time, the weather being so fine\r\nand the water smooth, the gannets continued to return with the fish they\r\ncaught, almost all of which were taken from them by my companion, until\r\nshe had collected more than a dozen fish, from half a pound to a pound\r\nweight, which she put away, so that the birds and seal might not devour\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI was still in a half-dozing state, when the breathing and cold nose of\r\nNero touched my cheek, and the murmurings of my favourite roused me up,\r\nand I opened my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I am better now,\" said I, to Mrs Reichardt.  \"How kind you have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are better; but still, you must remain quiet.  Do you think\r\nthat you could walk to your bed-place?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" replied I, and with her assistance I rose up; but, when I\r\nafterwards gained my feet, I should have fallen if she had not supported\r\nme; but, assisted by her, I gained my bed and sank down again.\r\n\r\nShe raised my head higher, and then applied the linen cloth and cold\r\nwater as before.\r\n\r\n\"Try now,\" said she, \"if you cannot go to sleep.  When you awake again,\r\nI will have some dinner ready for you.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked her and shut my eyes.  Nero crawled to my bed-place, and with\r\nmy hand upon his head, I fell asleep, and remained so till near sunset,\r\nwhen I awoke with very little pain in my head, and much refreshed.  I\r\nfound Mrs Reichardt by my side.\r\n\r\n\"You are better now,\" said she.  \"Can you eat any dinner?  I must make\r\nfriends with Nero, for he has been disputing my right to come near your\r\nbedside, and his teeth are rather formidable.  However, I gave him the\r\ninside of the fish when I cleaned them, and we are better friends\r\nalready.  There is your dinner.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt placed before me some of the fish, broiled on the embers,\r\nand I ate very heartily.\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you,\" said I, \"to be working for me, when I ought to\r\nbe working for you--but you must not do it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only my share of the work when you are well,\" replied she; \"but my\r\nshare I always shall do.  I cannot be idle, and I am strong enough to do\r\na great deal; but we will talk about that to-morrow morning.  You will\r\nbe quite well by that time, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I feel well now,\" replied I, \"only I am very weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must put your trust in God, my poor boy.  Do you ever pray to Him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I try a little sometimes--but I don't know how.  Jackson never\r\ntaught me that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will.  Shall I pray now for both of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will God hear you?  What was it that you said just before I forgot\r\neverything this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you that there was another here besides ourselves, a good and\r\ngracious God, who is always with us and always ready to come to our\r\nassistance if we call upon Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me God lived beyond the stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor boy, as if He were a God who was afar off and did not attend to\r\nour prayers!  Such is not the case.  He is with us always in spirit,\r\nlistening to all our prayers, and reading every secret thought of our\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\nI was silent for some time, thinking upon what she had told me; at last\r\nI said--\"Then pray to Him.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt knelt down and prayed in a clear and fervent voice,\r\nwithout hesitation or stop.  She prayed for protection and support in\r\nour desolate condition, that we might be supplied with all things\r\nneedful for our sustenance, and have a happy deliverance from our\r\npresent position.  She prayed that we might be contented and resigned\r\nuntil it should please Him to rescue us--that we might put our whole\r\ntrust and confidence in Him, and submit without murmuring to whatever\r\nmight be His will.  She prayed for health and strength, for an increase\r\nof faith and gratitude towards Him for all His mercies.  She thanked him\r\nfor our having been preserved by being left on the desolate rock,\r\ninstead of having left it in the boat with the seamen.  (This surprised\r\nme.)  And then she prayed for me, entreating that she might be the\r\nhumble instrument of leading me to my Heavenly Father, and that He would\r\nbe pleased to pour down upon me His Holy Spirit, so that I might by\r\nfaith in Christ, be accepted, and become a child of God and an inheritor\r\nof eternal bliss.\r\n\r\nThere was something so novel to me and so beautiful in her fervency of\r\nprayer, that the tears came into my eyes, and about a minute after she\r\nhad finished, I said--\r\n\r\n\"I now recollect, at least, I think I do--for the memory of it is very\r\nconfused--that my mother used to kneel down by me and pray just as you\r\nhave done.  Oh, how I wish I had a mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" replied she, \"promise me that you will be a good and\r\nobedient son, and I will be a mother to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you?  Oh!  How kind of you.  Yes, I will be all you wish; I will\r\nwork for you day and night if it is necessary.  I will do everything, if\r\nyou will but be my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my duty to you as a mother most strictly,\" replied she; \"so\r\nthat is agreed upon.  Now, you had better go to sleep, if you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must first ask you a question.  Why did you thank God for the\r\nseamen having left us here, instead of taking us with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the boat was overloaded as it was; because the men, having\r\nliquor, would become careless and desperate, and submit to no control;\r\nand therefore I think there is little or no chance of their ever\r\narriving anywhere safe, but that they will perish miserably in some way\r\nor another.  This, I consider, is the probability, unless the Almighty\r\nin His mercy, should be pleased to come to their assistance, and allow\r\nthem to fall in with some vessel soon after their departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, then, that God prevented our going with them on purpose\r\nthat we might not share their fate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do!  God regulates everything.  Had it been better for us that we\r\nshould have gone, He would have permitted it; but He willed it\r\notherwise, and we must bow to His will with a full faith, that He orders\r\neverything for the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say that God will give us all that we ask for in our prayers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if we pray fervently and in faith, and ask it in the name of Jesus\r\nChrist; that is, He will grant all we pray for that is good for us, but\r\nnot what is not good for us; but when we ask anything, we do not know\r\nthat we are asking what is proper or not--but He does.  We may ask what\r\nwould be hurtful to us, and then, in His love for us, He denies it.  For\r\ninstance, suppose you had been accustomed to pray, you must have prayed\r\nGod that He would permit you to leave this island in the boat, as you\r\nare so anxious to go away; but supposing that boat is lost, as I imagine\r\nit will be, surely it would have been a kindness in God, who knew that\r\nit would be lost, not to grant your prayer.  Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see now, thank you; now I will go to sleep--good night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nI awoke the next morning quite recovered from my illness of the day\r\nbefore, and was out of the cabin before Mrs Reichardt, who still\r\nremained behind the screen which she had put up after I had gone to\r\nsleep.  It was a beautiful morning, the water was smooth, and merely\r\nrippled with a light breeze, and the sun shone bright.  I felt well and\r\nhappy.  I lighted a fire to broil the fish for breakfast, as there was a\r\nsufficiency left, and then got my fishing-lines ready to catch some\r\nlarger fish to re-inhabit my pond at the bathing-pool.  Mrs Reichardt\r\ncame out of the cabin and found me playing with Nero.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, dear mother,\" said I, for I felt most kindly towards her.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my dear boy,\" replied she.  \"Are you quite well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well; and I have got my lines all ready; for I have been thinking\r\nthat until the birds come, we must live on fish altogether, and we can\r\nonly take them in fine weather like this; so we must not lose such a\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.  As soon as we have breakfasted, we will go down and\r\nfish.  I can fish very well, I am used to it.  We must both work now;\r\nbut first go for your Bible, that we may read a little.\"\r\n\r\nI did so, and after she had read a chapter, she prayed, and I knelt by\r\nher side; then we breakfasted, and as soon as we had breakfasted, we set\r\noff to the bathing-pool.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know if they left anything behind them, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I, \"they left some oars, I believe, and a long line, and\r\nwe have the shovel and the hammer, and the boat's small sail, up at the\r\ncabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall see very soon,\" replied she, as we went down the path.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the bathing-pool, the first thing that met my eyes\r\nmade me leap with joy.  \"Oh!  Mother!  Mother!  They've left the iron\r\npot; I did so long for it; and as I lay awake this morning, I thought\r\nthat if I prayed for anything, it would be for the iron pot.  I was\r\ntired of dried birds, and they ate so different when they were boiled up\r\nin the pot with potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am equally glad, Frank, for I do not like victuals uncooked; but now\r\nlet us first see what else they have thrown out of the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they have put on shore three of the little casks of water,\" said\r\nI; \"they took them all on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have so, I suppose, because the boat was too heavy, and they would\r\nnot part with the liquor.  Foolish men, they will now not have more than\r\nsix days' water, and will suffer dreadfully.\"\r\n\r\nWe then looked round the rocks and found that they had left the iron\r\nkettle, three breakers, five oars, and a harpoon and staffs; a\r\ngang-board, a whale-line of 200 fathoms, an old saw, a bag of\r\nbroad-headed nails, and two large pieces of sheet-iron.\r\n\r\n\"That saw may be very useful to us,\" said Mrs Reichardt, \"especially as\r\nyou have files in your chests.  Indeed, if we want them, we may convert\r\none half of the saw into knives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Into knives!  How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will show you; and these pieces of sheet-iron I could use again.  You\r\nsee the sheet-iron was put on to repair any hole which might be made in\r\nthe boat, and they have thrown it out, as well as the hammer and nails.\r\nI wonder at John Gough permitting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard them quarrelling with him as I came out yesterday to fetch you\r\ndown; they would not mind what he said.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, or we should not have been left here,\" replied she; \"John Gough was\r\ntoo good a man to have allowed it, if he could have prevented it.  That\r\nsheet-iron will be very useful.  Do you know what for?  To broil fish\r\non, or anything else.  We must turn up the corners with the hammer.  But\r\nnow we must lose no more time, but fish all day long, and not think of\r\neating till supper-time.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly we threw out our lines, and the fish taking the bait freely,\r\nwe soon hauled in more than a dozen large fish, which I put into the\r\nbathing-pool.\r\n\r\n\"What use can we make of that long line which they have left?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good many; but the best use we can make of it, is to turn it into\r\nfishing-lines, when we require new ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we do that, it is so thick and heavy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I will show you how to unlay it, and then make it up again.\r\nRecollect, Frank, that I have been the wife of a Missionary, and have\r\nfollowed my husband wherever he went; sometimes we have been well off,\r\nsometimes as badly off as you and I are now--for a Missionary has to go\r\nthrough great dangers, and great hardships, as you would acknowledge if\r\nyou ever heard my life, or rather that of my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you tell it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, perhaps I will, some day or another; but what I wish to point out\r\nto you now is, that being his wife, and sharing his danger and\r\nprivation, I have been often obliged to work hard and to obtain my\r\nliving as I could.  In England, women do little except in the house, but\r\na Missionary's wife is obliged to work with the men, and as a man very\r\noften, and therefore learns to do many things of which women in general\r\nare ignorant.  You understand now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes.  I have thought already that you appear to know more than\r\nJackson did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think not; but Jackson was not fond of work I expect, and I\r\nam.  And now, Frank, you little thought that when you so tardily went to\r\nwork the other day to plant potatoes for the benefit of any one that\r\nmight hereafter come to the island, that you were planting for yourself,\r\nand would reap the benefit of your own kind act; for if you had not\r\nassisted, of course I could not have done it by myself: so true it is,\r\nthat even in this world you are very often rewarded for a good action.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are not you always?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my child, you must not expect that; but if not rewarded in this\r\nworld, you will be rewarded in the next.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that you hardly can, but I will explain all that to you, if\r\nGod spare my life; but it must be at a more seasonable time.\"\r\n\r\nWe continued fishing till late in the afternoon, by which time had taken\r\ntwenty-eight large fish, about seven to nine pounds weight; Mrs\r\nReichardt then proposed that we should leave off, as we had already\r\nprovision for a fortnight.\r\n\r\nI hauled out one more fish, which she took with her to cook for our\r\nsupper, and having coiled up my lines, I then commenced, as she had told\r\nme to do, carrying up the articles left by the boat's crew at the\r\nbathing-pool.  The first thing I seized upon was the coveted iron\r\nkettle; I was quite overjoyed at the possession of this article, and I\r\nhad good reason to be.  In my other hand I carried the saw and the bag\r\nof nails.  As soon as I had deposited them at the cabin, I went down\r\nagain, and before supper was ready I had brought up everything except\r\nthe three breakers of water, which I left where they were, as we did not\r\nwant them for present use, whatever we might hereafter.  We were both\r\nrather tired, and were glad to go to bed after we had taken our supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nWhen we met the following morning, my mother, as I shall in future call\r\nher, said to me, \"This will be a busy day, Frank, for we have a great\r\nmany arrangements to make in the cabin, so that we may be comfortable.\r\nIn future the cabin must be kept much more clean and tidy than it is;\r\nbut that is my business more than yours.  Let us get our breakfasts, and\r\nthen we will begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you want me to do,\" replied I; \"but I will do it if I\r\ncan, as soon as you tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, a woman requires a portion of the cabin to herself, as it\r\nis not the custom for women to live altogether with men.  Now, what I\r\nwish is, that the hinder part of the cabin, where you used to stow away\r\nyour dried birds, should be made over to me.  We have oars with which we\r\ncan make a division, and then nail up seal-skins, so that I may have\r\nthat part of the cabin to myself.  Now, do you understand what I want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the oars are longer than the cabin is wide,\" observed I.  \"How\r\nshall we manage it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have the old saw, and that will do well enough to cut them off,\r\nwithout its being sharpened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never saw one used,\" replied I, \"and I don't understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will soon show you.  First, we must measure the width of the cabin.\r\nI shall not take away more than one-third of it.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother went into the cabin, and I followed her.  With a piece of\r\nfishing-line, she took the width of the cabin, and then the height up to\r\nthe rafters for the door-posts.  We then went out, and with the saw,\r\nwhich she showed me how to use, and which astonished me very much, when\r\nI perceived its effects, the oars were cut up to the proper length.\r\nGimlets I had already from the sea-chest, and nails and hammer we had\r\njust obtained from the boat; so that before the forenoon was over, the\r\nframework was all ready for nailing on the seal-skins.  The bag of\r\nbroad-headed short nails, which had been thrown on the rocks, were\r\nexcellent for this purpose, and as I had plenty of skins, the cabin was\r\nsoon divided off, with a skin between the door-jambs hanging down loose,\r\nso that any one might enter.  I went inside after it was complete.\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"you have no light to see what you are about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, but I soon will have,\" replied my mother.  \"Bring the saw\r\nhere, Frank.  Observe, you must cut through the side of the cabin here,\r\na square hole of this size; three of the planks cut through will be\r\nsufficient.  Begin here.\"\r\n\r\nI did as she directed me, and in the course of half an hour, I had cut\r\nout of the south side of the cabin a window about two feet square, which\r\nadmitted plenty of light.\r\n\r\n\"But won't it make it cold at night?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"We will prevent that,\" replied she, and she took out a piece of white\r\nlinen, and with some broad-headed nails, she nailed it up, so as to\r\nprevent the air from coming in, although there was still plenty of\r\nlight.  \"There,\" said she, \"that is but a coarse job, which I will mend\r\nby-and-bye; but it will do for the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is very nice and comfortable now,\" said I, looking round it.\r\n\"Now what shall I bring in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for the bed but seal-skins,\" said she.  \"I do not like the\r\nfeathers.  The seal-skins are stiff at present, but I think we may be\r\nable to soften them by-and-bye.  Now, Frank, your chest had better come\r\nin here, as it is of no use where it is, and we will make a storeroom of\r\nit, to hold all our valuables.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the diamonds?\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, we have articles to put into the chest, which, in our\r\npresent position, are more valuable to us than all the diamonds in the\r\nworld.  Tell me now, yourself, what do you prefer and set most value\r\nupon, your belt of diamonds, or the iron kettle?\"\r\n\r\n\"The iron kettle, to be sure,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so; and there are many things in our possession as valuable as\r\nthe iron kettle, as you will hereafter acknowledge.  Now do you go and\r\nget ready some fire for us, and I will finish here by myself Nero keep\r\nout, sir--you are never to come into this cabin.\"\r\n\r\nI went with Nero for a fish, and when I returned.  I determined that I\r\nwould use the iron kettle.  I put it on with water and boiled the fish,\r\nand I thought that it ate better than broiled on the embers, which made\r\nit too dry.\r\n\r\nAs we sat at our meal, I said, \"Dear mother, what are we to do next?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning we will put the cabin into better order, and put away\r\nall our things, instead of leaving them about the platform in this way.\r\nThen I will carefully look over all that we have got, and put them away\r\nin the chest.  I have not yet seen the contents of the chest.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day it was very cloudy and rough weather, blowing fresh.  After\r\nbreakfast we set to work.  We cleared out the floor of the cabin, which\r\nwas strewed with all manner of things, for Jackson and I had not been\r\nvery particular.  The whale-line was coiled up and put into one corner\r\nand everything else was brought in and a place round for it.\r\n\r\n\"We must contrive some shelves,\" said my mother, \"that we may put things\r\non them, or else we never can be tidy; and we have not one except that\r\nwhich holds the books.  I think we can manage it.  We have, two oars\r\nleft besides the boat's yard; we will nail them along the side of the\r\ncabin, about a foot or more from it, and then we will cut some of the\r\nboat's sail, and nail the canvass from the side of the cabin to the\r\noars, and that will make a sort of shelf which will hold our things.\"\r\n\r\nI brought in the oars; they were measured and cut off and nailed up.\r\nThe canvass was then stretched from the side of the cabin to the oar,\r\nand nailed with the broad-headed nails, and made two capital shelves on\r\neach side of the cabin, running from one end to the other.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said my mother, \"that is a good job.  Now we will examine the\r\nchest and put everything away and in its place.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother took out all the clothes, and folded them up.  When she found\r\nthe roll of duck which was at the bottom, she said--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to find this, as I can make a dress for myself much better\r\nfor this island than this black stuff dress which I now wear, and which\r\nI will put by to wear, in case we should be taken off the island some of\r\nthese days; for I must dress like other people when I am again among\r\nthem.  The clothes are sufficient to last you for a long while; but I\r\nshall only alter two shirts and two pair of trousers to your present\r\nsize, as you will grow very fast.  How old do you think you are now?\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"About sixteen years old, or perhaps more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think that was about your age.\"\r\n\r\nHaving examined and folded up every article of clothing in the chest,\r\nthe tools, spy-glass, etcetera, were put by me on the shelves, and then\r\nwe examined the box containing the thread, needles, fish-hooks, and\r\nother articles, such as buttons, etcetera.\r\n\r\n\"These are valuable,\" said she; \"I have some of my own to put along with\r\nthem.  Go and fetch my basket; I have not yet had time to look into it\r\nsince I left the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except brushes and combs, I can hardly say.  When I travelled about, I\r\nalways carried my basket, containing those things most requisite for\r\ndaily use, and in the basket I put everything that I wished to preserve,\r\ntill I had an opportunity to put it away.  When I embarked on board of\r\nthe whaler, I brought my basket on my arm as usual; but except opening\r\nit for my brushes and combs or scissors, I have not examined it for\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are brushes and combs and scissors?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will show you,\" replied she, opening the lid of the basket.\r\n\"These are the brushes and combs for cleaning the hair, and these are\r\nscissors.  Now we will take everything out.\"\r\n\r\nThe basket did indeed appear to contain a wonderful quantity of things,\r\nalmost all new to me.  There were two brushes, twelve combs, three pair\r\nof scissors, a penknife, a little bottle of ink, some pens, a woman's\r\nthimble, a piece of wax, a case of needles, thread and silk, a piece of\r\nIndia ink, and a camel's hair brush, sealing-wax, sticking plaster, a\r\nbox of pills, some tape and bobbin, paper of pins, a magnifying-glass,\r\nsilver pencil-case, some money in a purse, black shoe-ribbon, and many\r\nother articles which I have forgotten.  All I know is, that I never was\r\nso much interested ever after at any show as I was with the contents of\r\nthis basket, all of which were explained to me by my mother, as to their\r\nuses, and how they were made.  There were several little papers at the\r\nbottom of the basket, which she said were seeds of plants, which she had\r\ncollected to take to England with her, and that we would plant them\r\nhere.  As she shook the dust out of the basket after it was empty, two\r\nor three white things tumbled out, which she asked me to pick up and\r\ngive to her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how they came here,\" said she, \"but three of them are\r\norange-pips, which we will sow to-morrow, and the other is a pea, but of\r\nwhat kind I know not; we will sow that also--but I fear it will not come\r\nup, as it appears to me to be one of the peas served out to the sailors\r\non board ship, and will be too old to grow.  We can but try.  Now we\r\nwill put into the chest, with the other things that you have, what we do\r\nnot want for present use, and then I can drive a nail into the side of\r\nmy bedroom and hang my basket on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"this round glass--what is that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it on one side,\" replied she, \"and to-morrow, if it is fine, I will\r\nshow you the use of it; but there are some things we have forgotten,\r\nwhich are your belt and the other articles you gave me to take for you\r\nwhen you thought we were to leave the island.  They are in the bed-place\r\nopposite to yours.\"\r\n\r\nI brought them, and she put away the mate's watch and sleeve-buttons,\r\nand the other trinkets, etcetera, saying that she would examine the\r\nletters and papers at another time.  The belt was examined, counting how\r\nmany of the squares had stones in them, and then, with her scissors, she\r\ncut open one of the squares, and took out a white glittering thing like\r\nglass, as it appeared to me, and looked at it carefully.\r\n\r\n\"I am no great judge of these things,\" said she, \"but still I have\r\npicked up some little knowledge.  This belt, if it contain all stones\r\nlike this, must be of considerable value; now I must get out my needle\r\nand thread and sew it up again.\"  She did, and put the belt away with\r\nthe other articles in the chest.  \"And now,\" said she, \"we have done a\r\ngood day's work, and it is time to have something to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nI must say that I was much better pleased with the appearance of the\r\ncabin, it was so neat and clean to what it had been, and everything was\r\nout of the way.  The next day was a calm and clear day, and we went down\r\nto fish.  We were fortunate, and procured almost as many as we had done\r\nat the previous fishing--they were all put in the bathing-pool as\r\nbefore.  When we went up to the cabin, as soon as the fish was put on\r\nthe fire, under the direction of my mother, I turned up the sides of one\r\nof the pieces of sheet-iron, so as to make a sort of dish.  The other\r\npiece I did the same to, only not so high at the sides, as one piece was\r\nkept for baking the fish on and the other as a dish to put our dinner\r\nupon when cooked.  That day we had been too busy with fishing to think\r\nof anything else, but on the following I recollected the\r\nmagnifying-glass, and brought it to her.  She first showed me the power\r\nit had to magnify, with which I was much amused for a time, and she\r\nexplained as well as she could to me the cause of its having that power:\r\nbut I could not well understand her: I was more pleased with the effect\r\nthan cognisant of the cause.  Afterwards she sent me to the cabin for\r\nsome of the dried moss which I used for tinder, and placing the glass so\r\nas to concentrate the rays of the sun, to my astonishment I saw the\r\ntinder caught fire.  It was amazement more than astonishment, and I\r\nlooked up to see where the fire came from.  My mother explained to me,\r\nand I, to a certain degree, comprehended; but I was too anxious to have\r\nthe glass in my own hands and try experiments.  I lighted the tinder\r\nagain--then I burnt my hand--then I singed one of the gannet's heads,\r\nand lastly, perceiving that Nero was fast asleep in the sun, I obtained\r\nthe focus on his cold nose.  He started up with a growl, which made me\r\nretreat, and I was perfectly satisfied with the result of my\r\nexperiments.  From that time, the fire was, when the sun shone,\r\ninvariably lighted by the burning-glass, and very useful did I find it.\r\nAs it was so portable, I always carried it with me, and when I had\r\nnothing to do, I magnified, or set fire, according to the humour of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not mentioned it, not a morning rose, but before\r\nbreakfast, I read the Scriptures to my mother.\r\n\r\n\"There's so much in that book which I cannot understand,\" said I, one\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"I suspect that, living as you have, alone on this island, and having\r\nseen nothing of the world,\" replied my mother, \"that there are not many\r\nbooks that you would understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I understand all that is said in the Beast and Bird Book,\" replied\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you may, or think you do; but, Frank, you must not class the\r\nBible with other books.  The other books are the works of man; but the\r\nBible is the word of God.  There are many portions of that book which\r\nthe cleverest men, who have devoted their lives to its study, cannot\r\nunderstand, and which never will be understood as long as this world\r\nendures.  In many parts the Bible is a sealed book.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will it never be understood then by anybody?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is quite as much of the Bible as is necessary for men to follow\r\nits precepts, and this is so clear that anybody may understand it--it\r\ncontains all that is necessary for salvation; but there are passages,\r\nthe true meaning of which we cannot explain, and which God, for His own\r\npurposes, will not permit us to do.  But if we do not know them now, we\r\nshall probably hereafter, when we have left this world, and our\r\nintellects more nearly approach God's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't understand why we should not understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" replied she, \"look at that flower just in bloom.  Do you\r\nunderstand how it is that that plant keeps alive--grows every year--\r\nevery year throws out a large blue flower?  Why should it do so?  Why\r\nshould the flower always be blue?  And whence comes that beautiful\r\ncolour?  Can you tell me?  You see, you know that it does do so.  But\r\ncan you tell me what makes it do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at that bird.  You know it is hatched from an egg.  How is it that\r\nthe inside of an egg is changed into bird?  How is that the bird is\r\ncovered with feathers, and has the power to fly?  Can you explain to me\r\nyourself?  You can walk about just as you please--you have the power of\r\nreasoning, and thinking, and of acting; but by what means is it that you\r\npossess that power?  Can you tell?  You know that is so, but you know no\r\nmore.  You can't tell why, or how, or what causes produce these\r\neffects--can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, if you are surrounded by all manner of things, living and\r\ndead, and see every day things which you cannot explain, or understand,\r\nwhy should you be surprised that, as God has not let you know by what\r\nmeans these effects are produced, that in His written word He should\r\nalso keep from you that which for good purposes you are not permitted to\r\nknow.  Everything here is by God's will, and that must be sufficient for\r\nus.  Now do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see now what you mean, but I never thought about these things\r\nbefore.  Tell me some more about the Bible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now.  Some day I will give you a history of the Bible, and then you\r\nwill understand the nature of the book, and why it was written; but not\r\nat present.  Suppose, as we have nothing particular to do, you tell me\r\nall you know about yourself from Jackson, and all that happened while\r\nyou lived with him.  I have heard only part, and I should like to know\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied I.  \"I will tell you everything, but it will take a\r\nlong while.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have plenty of time to spare, my dear boy, I fear, before we\r\nleave this place; so never mind time--tell me everything.\"\r\n\r\nI commenced my narrative, but I was interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never been able to call your own mother to your memory?\" said\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can now, since I have seen you; but I could not before.  I\r\nnow can recollect a person dressed like you, kneeling down and praying\r\nby my side; and I said before, the figure has appeared in my dreams, and\r\nmuch oftener since you have been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not the slightest remembrance of him, or anybody else except my\r\nmother.\"  I then proceeded, and continued my narrative until it was time\r\nto go to bed; but as I was very circumstantial, and was often\r\ninterrupted by questions, I had not told a quarter of what I had to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt had promised to give me a history of the Bible; and one\r\nday, when the weather kept us both at home, she thus commenced her\r\nnarrative:--\r\n\r\n\"The Bible is a history of God's doings for the salvation of man.  It\r\ncommences with the fall of man by disobedience, and ends with the\r\nsacrifice made for his reinstatement.  As by one man, Adam, sin came\r\ninto the world, so by one man, Jesus Christ, was sin and death overcome.\r\nIf you will refer to the third chapter of Genesis, at the very\r\ncommencement of the Bible, you will find that at the same time that Adam\r\nreceives his punishment, a promise is made by the Lord, that the head of\r\nthe serpent shall hereafter be bruised.  The whole of the Bible, from\r\nthe very commencement, is an announcement of the coming of Christ; so\r\nthat as soon as the fault had been committed, the Almighty, in His\r\nmercy, had provided a remedy.  Nothing is unknown or unforeseen by God.\r\n\r\n\"Recollect, Frank, that the Bible contains the history of God's doings,\r\nbut it does not often tell is why such things were done.  It must be\r\nsufficient for us to know that such was the will of God; when He thinks\r\nproper, He allows us to understand His ways; but to our limited\r\ncapacities, most of His doings are inscrutable.  But are we to suppose\r\nthat, because we, in our foolishness, cannot comprehend His reasons,\r\nthat therefore they must be cavilled at?  Do you understand me, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"I do pretty well.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I pointed out to you the other day, you see the blade of grass grow,\r\nand you see it flower, but how it does so you know not.  If then you are\r\nsurrounded all your life with innumerable things which you see but\r\ncannot comprehend--when all nature is a mystery to you--even yourself--\r\nhow can you expect to understand the dealings of God in other things?\r\nWhen, therefore, you read the Bible, you must read it with faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is faith?  I don't quite understand, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank, I have often told you of many things that are in England, where\r\nyou one day hope to go.  Now, if, when you arrive in England, you find\r\nthat everything that I have told you is quite true, you will be\r\nsatisfied that I am worthy of belief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose some one were to tell you something relative to any other\r\ncountry, which you could not understand, and you came to me and asked me\r\nif such were the case, would you, having found that I told you truth\r\nwith regard to England, believe that what you had been told of this\r\nother country was true, if I positively asserted that it was so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I should, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Frank, that would be faith; a belief in things not only not\r\nseen, but which you cannot understand.  But, to go on, I mention this\r\nbecause some people are so presumptuous as to ask the why and the\r\nwherefore of God's doings, and attempt to argue upon their justice,\r\nforgetting that the little reason they have is the gift of God, and that\r\nthey must be endowed with intellect equal to the Almighty, to enable\r\nthem to know and perceive that which He decides upon.  But if God has\r\nnot permitted us to understand all his ways, still, wherever we can\r\ntrace the finger of God, we can always perceive that everything is\r\ndirected by an all-wise and beneficent hand; and that, although the\r\ncauses appear simple, the effects produced are extraordinary and\r\nwonderful.  We shall observe this as we talk over the history of the\r\nJews, in the Bible.  But, I repeat, that we must study the whole of the\r\nBible with faith, and not be continually asking ourselves, `Why was this\r\ndone?'  If you will turn to the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the\r\nRomans, you will see what the Apostle Paul says on the subject: `Nay\r\nbut, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?'  Shall the thing\r\nformed say to him that formed it, `Why hast thou made me thus?'  Do you\r\nnow understand in what spirit the Bible should be read?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do.  We must read it as the Word of God, and believe all that we\r\nread in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  Now we will proceed.  After Adam's fall, the earth became so\r\nwicked that God destroyed it, leaving but Noah and his family to\r\nre-people it; and as soon as this was done, the Almighty prepared for\r\nhis original intention for the future salvation of men.  He selected\r\nAbraham, who was a good man, and who had faith, to be the father of a\r\nnation chosen for His own people--that was the Jewish nation.  He told\r\nhim that his seed should multiply as the stars in the heavens, and that\r\nall the nations of the earth should be blessed in him; that is, that\r\nfrom his descendants should Christ be born, who should be the salvation\r\nof men.  Abraham's great grandchildren were brought into Egypt, to live\r\napart in the land of Goshen.  You have read the history of Joseph and\r\nhis brethren?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; I know that well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Almighty wished the Jews should be a nation apart from\r\nothers, and for that purpose he brought them into Egypt.  But observe,\r\nFrank, by what simple and natural causes this was effected.  It was by a\r\ndream of Joseph's, which, when he told them of it, irritated his\r\nbrothers against him; they sold him as a slave, and he was sent into\r\nEgypt.  There, having explained the dream of Pharaoh, he was made a\r\nruler over Egypt, and saved that country from the famine which was in\r\nevery other land.  His brothers come down to buy corn, and he recognises\r\nthem.  He sends for his father and all the family, and establishes them\r\nin the land of Goshen, as shepherds, apart from the Egyptians.  Here\r\nthey multiplied fast; but after Joseph's elevation they were cruelly\r\ntreated by the Egyptians, who became afraid of their rapid increase, and\r\neventually the kings of Egypt gave orders that all the male children of\r\nthe Jews should be destroyed.  It was at this time, when they were so\r\noppressed and cruelly treated by the Egyptians, that God interfered and\r\nsent for Moses.  Moses, like all the rest of the Jews, knew nothing of\r\nthe true God, and was difficult to persuade; and it was only by miracles\r\nthat he was convinced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did God keep the Jews apart from the Egyptians, and have them\r\nthrown in bondage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he wished to prepare them to become his own peculiar people.\r\nBy their being descended from Abraham, and having never intermarried\r\nwith other nations, they had become a pure race; by being in bondage and\r\nseverely treated, they had suffered and become united as a people.  They\r\nknew no gods, but those worshipped by the Egyptians, and these gods it\r\nwas now the intention of the Almighty to confound, and prove to the Jews\r\nas worthless.  At the same time he worked with his own nation in\r\nmystery, for when Moses asked him what God he was to tell his people\r\nthat He was, the Almighty only replied by these words--`I am:' having no\r\nname like all the false gods worshipped by the Egyptians.  He was now\r\nabout to prove, by his wonderful miracles, the difference between\r\nhimself and the false gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are miracles?\"\r\n\r\n\"A miracle is doing that which man has no power of doing, proving that\r\nthe party who does it is superior to man; for instance--to restore a\r\ndead man to life is a miracle, as none but God, or those empowered by\r\nGod, could do so.  Miracles were necessary, therefore, to prove to the\r\nJews that the Almighty was the true God, and were resorted to by Him in\r\nthis instance, as well as in the coming of Our Saviour, when it was also\r\nnecessary to prove that he was the Son of God.  When the Almighty sent\r\nMoses to Pharaoh to demand that the Israelites should have permission to\r\nsacrifice in the desert, He purposely hardened the heart of Pharaoh that\r\nhe might refuse the request.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why did he so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he wanted to prove to the Israelites that He was the only true\r\nGod; and had Pharaoh consented to their going away, there would have\r\nbeen no opportunity of performing those miracles by which the Israelites\r\nwere to be delivered, and by which they were to acknowledge Him as their\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt often renewed this conversation, till I became acquainted\r\nwith Scriptural History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, I went with Nero to take a couple of fish out of\r\nthe pool.  As soon as Nero had caught them, he went into the other part\r\nof the bathing-pool to amuse himself, while I cleaned the fish, which I\r\ngenerally did before I went up to the cabin, giving him the heads and\r\ninsides for his share, if I did not require any portion for the birds.\r\nNero was full of play that morning, and when I threw the heads to him,\r\nas he frolicked in the water, he brought them out to the rocks; but\r\ninstead of eating them, as usual, he laid them at my feet.  I threw them\r\nin several times, and he continued to bring them out, and my mother,\r\ncoming down to me, was watching him.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said she, \"you must teach Nero to fetch and carry like a\r\ndog--try.  Instead of the heads, throw in this piece of wood;\" which she\r\nnow broke off the boat-hook staff.\r\n\r\nI did so, and Nero brought it out, as he had done the heads of the fish.\r\nI patted and coaxed the animal, and tried him again several times with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said my mother, \"you must accustom him to certain words when you\r\nsend him for anything.  Always say, `Fetch it, Nero!' and point with\r\nyour finger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why am I to do that, mother?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because the object to be gained is, not that the animal should fetch\r\nout what you throw in, but what you send it to bring out which you have\r\nnot thrown in.  Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I.  \"You mean, if there were anything floating near on\r\nthe sea, I should send him for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  Then Nero would be of some use.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will soon teach him,\" replied I; \"to-morrow I will send him into the\r\nsea after the piece of spar.  I've no fear that he will go away now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking last night, Frank, whether they had taken the pail with\r\nthem in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pail,\" said I; \"I know where it is, but I quite forgot it.  We left\r\nit up the ravine the last day we planted the potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did so, now I recollect.  I will go for it while you get the\r\nbreakfast ready.\"\r\n\r\nWe had now been for many weeks on a fish diet and I must confess that I\r\nwas tired of it, which was not the case when I lived upon the dried\r\nbirds during the whole of the year.  Why so I cannot tell; but I was\r\nsoon to learn to relish fish, if I could obtain them.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that the wind blew direct on the shore, but coming from\r\nthe northward and eastward, it was in a slanting direction; but\r\noccasionally, and chiefly about the time of the equinoxes, the gales\r\ncame on very heavy from the eastward, and then the wash of the seas upon\r\nthe rocky coast was tremendous.  Such was the case about this time.  A\r\nfierce gale of wind from the eastward raised a sea which threw the surf\r\nand spray high over the loftiest of the rocks, and the violence of the\r\nwind bore the spray far inland.  The gale had come on in the evening,\r\nand my mother and I, when we rose in the morning, were standing on the\r\nplatform before the cabin, admiring the grandeur of the scene, but\r\nwithout the least idea that it was to be productive of so much misery to\r\nourselves.  My mother pointed out to me some passages in the Psalms and\r\nOld Testament bearing strongly upon the scene before us; after a time I\r\ncalled Nero, and went down with him to take fish out of the pool for our\r\nday's consumption.  At that time we had a large supply in the pool--more\r\nthan ever, I should say.  When I arrived at the pool, I found the waves\r\nseveral feet in height rolling in over the ledges, and the pool one mass\r\nof foam, the water in it being at least two or three feet higher than\r\nusual; still it never occurred to me that there was any mischief done,\r\nuntil I had sent Nero in for the fish, and found that, after floundering\r\nand diving for some time, he did not bring out one.  My mind misgave me;\r\nand I ordered him in again.  He remained some time and then returned\r\nwithout a fish, and I was then satisfied that from the rolling in of the\r\nwaves, and the unusual quantity of the water in the pool, the whole of\r\nthe fish had escaped, and that we were now without any provisions or\r\nmeans of subsistence, until the weather should settle, and enable us to\r\ncatch some more.\r\n\r\nAghast at the discovery, I ran up to the cabin, and called to my mother,\r\nwho was in her bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother, all the fish have got out of the pool, and we have nothing\r\nto eat.  I told you we should be starved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take time, Frank, and take breath,\" replied she, \"and then tell me what\r\nhas happened to cause this alarm and dismay, that you appear to be in.\"\r\n\r\nI explained to her what had happened, and that Nero could not find one\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that what you say must be correct,\" replied she; \"but we must\r\nput our trust in God.  It is His will, and whatever He wills must be\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot say I was Christian enough at the time to acknowledge the truth\r\nof her reply, and I answered, \"If God is as good and as gracious as you\r\nsay, will He allow us to starve?  Does he know that we are starving?\"\r\ncontinued I.\r\n\r\n\"Does He know, Frank?\" replied my mother.  \"What does the Bible say--\r\nthat not a sparrow falls to the ground without His knowledge; and of how\r\nmuch more worth are you than many sparrows?  Shame upon you, Frank!\"  I\r\nwas abashed, but not satisfied; I therefore replied quietly, \"We have\r\nnothing to eat, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted that we have lost all our fish, Frank, still we are not yet\r\nstarving; the weather may moderate to-morrow, and we may catch some\r\nmore, or even if it should not till the day afterwards, we can bear to\r\nbe two days without food.  Let us hope for the best and put our trust in\r\nGod--let us pray to Him and ask him for his assistance.  He can rebuke\r\nthese stormy waters--He can always find means of helping those who put\r\nconfidence in Him, and will send us aid when all hope appears gone.\r\nPray, Frank, as I will do fervently, and believing that your prayer is\r\nheard--pray with faith, and your prayer will be answered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not always so,\" replied I; \"you have told me of many people who\r\nhave died of starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I grant it, and for all-wise purposes they were permitted so to do; but\r\nthe Almighty had reasons for permitting it, unknown to us, but which you\r\nmay depend upon it, were good.  We cannot fathom His decrees.  He may\r\neven now decide that such is to be our fate; but if so, depend upon it,\r\nFrank, all is right, and what appears to you now as cruel and neglectful\r\nof you, would, if the future could be looked into by us, prove to have\r\nbeen an act of mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, then, that we shall starve?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not--I have too much faith in God's mercy, and I do not think that\r\nHe would have preserved our lives by preventing the men from taking us\r\ninto the boat if we were now to starve.  God is not inconsistent; and I\r\nfeel assured that, forlorn as our present position appears to be, and\r\ntried as our faith in Him may be, we shall still be preserved, and live\r\nto be monuments of his gracious love and kindness.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of my mother and the implicit confidence which she appeared\r\nto have, much revived me.  \"Well,\" said I, \"I hope you are right, my\r\ndear mother; and now I think of it,\" continued I, brightening up at the\r\nidea, \"if the worst come to the worst, we can eat the birds; I don't\r\ncare much for them now, and if I did, you should not starve, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you would not hesitate to sacrifice the birds, Frank; but a\r\ngreater sacrifice may be demanded of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" inquired I; and then after a little thought I said, \"You don't\r\nmean Nero, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, I did mean Nero, Frank; for the birds will not be a\r\nsupport for more than a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never could kill Nero, mother,\" replied I, gloomily; and walking away\r\ninto the cabin, I sat down very melancholy at the idea of my favourite\r\nbeing sacrificed; to me it appeared quite horrible, and my mother having\r\nreferred to it, made her fall very much in my good opinion.  Alas!  I\r\nwas indeed young and foolish, and little thought what a change would\r\ntake place in my feelings.  As for the birds, as I really did not care\r\nfor them, I resolved to kill two of them for our day's meal, and\r\nreturning to the platform I had laid hold of the two that were there and\r\nhad seized both by the neck, when my mother asked me what I was going to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"Kill them, and put them in the pot for our dinner,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Frank!  You are too hasty.  Let us make some little sacrifice,\r\neven for the poor birds.  We surely can fast one day without very great\r\nsuffering.  To-morrow will be time enough.\"\r\n\r\nI dropped the birds from my hand, tacitly consenting to her proposal.\r\nIt was not, however, for the sake of the birds that I did so, but\r\nbecause one day's respite for the birds would be a day's respite for\r\nNero.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said my mother, \"let us go into the cabin and get some work.  I\r\nwill alter some of the clothes for you.  What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied I, \"but I will do whatever you tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I perceive that the two fishing-lines are much worn, and\r\nthey may break very soon, and then we shall be without the means of\r\ntaking fish, even if the weather is fine; so now we will cut off some of\r\nthe whale-line, and when it is unravelled, I will show you how to lay it\r\nup again into fishing-line; and, perhaps, instead of altering the\r\nclothes, I had better help you, as fishing-lines are now of more\r\nconsequence to us than anything else.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an arrangement which I gladly consented to.  In a short time\r\nthe whale-line was unravelled, and my mother showed me how to lay it up\r\nin three yarns, so as to make a stout fishing-line.  She assisted, and\r\nthe time passed away more rapidly than I had expected it would.\r\n\r\n\"You are very clever, mother,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No, my child, I am not, but I certainly do know many things which women\r\nin general are not acquainted with; but the reason of this is, I have\r\nlived a life of wandering, and occasional hardships.  Often left to our\r\nown resources, when my husband and I were among strangers, we found the\r\nnecessity of learning to do many things for ourselves, which those who\r\nhave money usually employ others to do for them; but I have been in\r\nsituations where even money was of no use, and had to trust entirely to\r\nmyself.  I have, therefore, always made it a rule to learn everything\r\nthat I could; and as I have passed much of my life in sailing over the\r\ndeep waters, I obtained much useful knowledge from the seamen, and this\r\nof laying up fishing-lines is one of the arts which they communicated to\r\nme.  Now, you see, I reap the advantage of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied I; \"and so do I.  How lucky it was that you came to this\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for me, do you mean, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother!  I mean how lucky for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust that I have been sent here to be useful, Frank, and with that\r\nfeeling I cheerfully submit to the will of God.  He has sent me that I\r\nmay be useful to you, I do not doubt; and if by my means you are drawn\r\ntowards Him, and, eventually, become one of His children, I shall have\r\nfulfilled my mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you quite, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you cannot as yet; but everything in season,\" replied she, slowly\r\nmusing.  \"`First the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn in the\r\near.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said I, \"I should like to hear the whole story of your life.\r\nYou know I have told you all that I know about myself.  Now, suppose you\r\ntell me your history, and that of your husband.  You did say that\r\nperhaps one day you would.  Do you recollect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do recollect that I did make a sort of promise, Frank, and I\r\npromise you now that some day I will fulfil it; but I am not sure that\r\nyou will understand or profit by the history now, so much as you may\r\nby-and-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but mother, you can tell me the story twice, and I shall be glad\r\nto hear it again; so tell it to me now, to amuse me, and by-and-bye,\r\nthat I may profit by it.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother smiled, which she very seldom did, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank, as I know you would at any time give up your dinner to\r\nlisten to a story, and as you will have no dinner to-day, I think it is\r\nbut fair that I should consent to your wish.  Who shall I begin with--\r\nwith my husband or with myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray begin with your own history,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\n\"I am the daughter of a parish clerk in a small market-town near the\r\nsouthern coast of England, within a few miles of a large seaport.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a parish clerk?\"  I asked, interrupting my mother at the\r\ncommencement of her promised narrative.\r\n\r\n\"A parish clerk,\" she replied, \"is a man who is employed in the parish\r\nor place to which he belongs, to fulfil certain humble duties in\r\nconnection with the church or place of worship where the people meet\r\ntogether to worship God.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he do there?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"He gives out the psalms that are to be sung, leads the congregation in\r\nmaking their responses to the minister appointed to perform the services\r\nof the church; has the custody of the registry of births, deaths, and\r\nburials of the inhabitants, and the care of the church monuments, and of\r\nother property belonging to the building.  In some places he also\r\nfulfils the duties of bell-ringer and grave-digger; that is to say, by\r\nringing a large bell at the top of the church, he summons the people to\r\ntheir devotions, during their lives, and digs a hole in consecrated\r\nground, surrounding the sacred building, to receive their bodies when\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nI mused on this strange combination of offices, and entertained a notion\r\nof the importance of such a functionary, which I afterwards found was\r\ncompletely at variance with the real state of the case.\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" she resumed, \"not only fulfilled all these duties, but\r\ncontrived to perform the functions of schoolmaster to the parish\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are parish children?\"  I asked eagerly.  \"I know what children\r\nare, as Jackson represented to me that I was the child of my father and\r\nmother--but what makes children parish children?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the children of the poor,\" Mrs Reichardt replied, \"who, not\r\nbeing able to afford them instruction, willingly allow them to be taught\r\nat the expense of the people of the parish generally.\"\r\n\r\nI thought this a praiseworthy arrangement.  I knew nothing of\r\npoor's-rates, and the system of giving relief to the poor of the parish,\r\nso long used in England, afterwards explained to me; but the kindness\r\nand wisdom of this plan of instruction became evident to my\r\nunderstanding.  I was proceeding to ask other questions, when my mother\r\nstopped them by saying, that if I expected her to get through her story,\r\nI must let her proceed without further interruption; for many things\r\nwould be mentioned by her, which demanded explanation, for one so\r\ncompletely unaware of their existence as myself, and that it would be\r\nimpossible to make me thoroughly acquainted with such things within any\r\nreasonable time; the proper explanations she promised should follow.\r\nShe then proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"My father, it may be thought, had enough on his hands; but in an\r\nobscure country town, it is not unusual for one man to unite the\r\noccupations of several, and this was particularly the case with my\r\nfather, who, in addition to the offices I have enumerated, was the best\r\ncattle-doctor and bone-setter within ten miles, and often earned his\r\nbread at different kinds of farmer's work; such as thatching, hedging,\r\nditching, and the like.  Nevertheless, he found time to read his Bible,\r\nand bring up his only daughter religiously.  This daughter was myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had become of your mother?\"  I asked, as I thought it strange Mrs\r\nReichardt should only mention one parent.\r\n\r\n\"She had died very soon after my birth,\" she answered, \"and I was left\r\nat first to the care of a poor woman, who nursed me; as soon, however,\r\nas I could run about, and had exhibited some signs of intelligence, my\r\nfather began to get so partial to me, that he very reluctantly allowed\r\nme to go out of his sight.  He took great pains in teaching me what he\r\nknew; and though the extent of his acquirements was by no means great,\r\nit was sufficient to lay a good foundation, and establish a desire for\r\nmore comprehensive information, which I sought every available means to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\n\"I remember that at a very early age, I exhibited an extraordinary\r\ncuriosity for a child, constantly asking questions, not only of my\r\nfather, but of all his friends and visitors; and, as they seemed to\r\nconsider me a quick and lively child, they took pleasure in satisfying\r\nmy inquisitive spirit.  In this way I gained a great deal of knowledge,\r\nand, by observation of what passed around me, a great deal more.\r\n\r\n\"It soon became a source of pride and gratification with my father, to\r\nask me to read the Bible to him.  This naturally led to a good many\r\ninquiries on my part, and numerous explanations on his.  In course of\r\ntime, I became familiar with all the sacred writings, and knew their\r\nspirit and meaning much better than many persons who were more than\r\ndouble my age.\r\n\r\n\"My fondness for such studies, and consequent reputation, attracted the\r\nattention of Dr Brightwell, the clergyman of our parish, who had the\r\nkindness to let me share the instructions of his children, and still\r\nfurther advanced my education, and still more increased my natural\r\npredilection for religious information.  By the time I was thirteen, I\r\nbecame quite a prodigy in Christian learning, and was often sent for to\r\nthe parsonage, to astonish the great people of the neighbourhood, by the\r\nfacility with which I answered the most puzzling questions that were put\r\nto me, respecting the great mysteries of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\n\"It was about this time that I first became acquainted with an orphan\r\nboy, an inmate of the workhouse, who had been left to the care of the\r\nparish, by the sudden death of his parents, a German clockmaker and his\r\nwife, from a malignant fever which had visited the neighbourhood, and\r\ntaken off a considerable portion of the labouring population.  I had\r\nbeen sent on errands from my father to the master of the workhouse, a\r\nsevere, sullen man, of whom I had a great dread, and I noticed this\r\nchild, in consequence of his pale and melancholy countenance, and\r\napparently miserable condition.  I observed that no one took any notice\r\nof him; and that he was allowed to wander about the great straggling\r\nworkhouse, among the insane, the idiotic, and the imbecile, without the\r\nslightest attention being paid to his going and coming; in short, he\r\nlived the wretched life of a workhouse boy.\r\n\r\n\"I see that you are eager to ask what is a workhouse boy,\" said my\r\nmother, \"so I will anticipate your question.  There is, in the various\r\nparishes of the country to which we both belong, a building expressly\r\nset apart for the accommodation and support of the destitute and\r\ndisabled poor.  It usually contains inmates of all ages, from the infant\r\njust born to the very aged, whose infirmities show them to be on the\r\nverge of the grave.  They are all known to be in a state of helpless\r\npoverty, and quite unable to earn a subsistence for themselves.  In this\r\nbuilding they are clothed and fed; the younger provided with instruction\r\nnecessary to put them in the way of earning a livelihood; the elders of\r\nthe community enjoying the consolations of religion, accorded to them by\r\nthe regular visits of the chaplain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" I here observed, \"that the people who lived there were\r\ndeeply impressed with their good fortune in finding such an asylum?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I could ever ascertain,\" Mrs Reichardt replied, \"it was\r\nexactly the reverse.  It was always thought so degrading to enter a\r\nworkhouse, that the industrious labourer would endure any and every\r\nprivation rather than live there.  An honest hard-working man must be\r\nsorely driven indeed, to seek such a shelter in his distress.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems strange,\" I observed.  \"Why should he object to receive what\r\nhe so much stands in need of?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he thus comes upon the funds of the parish,\" answered my mother,\r\n\"he becomes what is called a pauper, and among the English peasantry of\r\nthe better sort, there is the greatest possible aversion to be ranked\r\nwith this degraded class.  Consequently, the inmates of the workhouses\r\nare either those whose infirmities prevent their earning a subsistence,\r\nor the idle and the dissolute, who feel none of the honest prejudices of\r\nself-dependence, and care only to live from day to day on the coarse and\r\nmeagre fare afforded them by the charity of their wealthier and more\r\nindustrious fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n\"The case of this poor boy I thought very pitiable.  I found out that\r\nhis name was Heinrich Reichardt.  He could speak no language but his own\r\nand therefore his wants remained unknown, and his feelings unregarded.\r\nHe had been brought up with a certain sense of comfort and decency,\r\nwhich was cruelly outraged by the position in which he found himself\r\nplaced by the sudden death of his parents.  I observed that he was often\r\nin tears; and his fair features and light hair contrasted remarkably\r\nwith the squalid faces and matted locks of his companions.  His\r\nwretchedness never failed to make a deep impression on me.\r\n\r\n\"I brought him little presents, and strove to express my sympathy for\r\nhis sufferings.  He seemed, at first, more surprised than grateful; but\r\nI shortly discovered that my attentions gave him unusual pleasure, and\r\nhe looked upon my visits as his only solace and gratification.\r\n\r\n\"Even at this period, I exercised considerable influence over my father,\r\nand I managed to interest him in the case of the poor foreign boy to\r\nsuch an extent, that he was induced to take him out of the workhouse,\r\nand find him a home under his own roof.  He was at first reluctant to\r\nburthen himself with the bringing up of a child, who, from his foreign\r\nlanguage and habits, could be of little use to him in his avocations;\r\nbut I promised to teach him English, and all other learning of which he\r\nstood most in need, and assured my father, that in a prodigious short\r\ntime I would make him a much abler assistant than he was likely to find\r\namong the boys of the town.\r\n\r\n\"My father's desire to please me, rather than any faith he reposed in my\r\nassertions, led him to allow me to do as I pleased in this affair.  I\r\nlost no time, therefore, in beginning my course of instruction, and in a\r\nfew weeks ascertained that I had an apt pupil, who was determined to\r\nproceed with his education as fast as circumstances would admit.  We\r\nwere soon able to express our ideas to each other, and in a few months\r\nread together the book out of which I had received so many invaluable\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time I became not less proud of, than partial to, my pupil.\r\nI took him through the same studies which I had pursued under the\r\nauspices of our clergyman, and was secretly pleased to find, not only\r\nthat he was singularly quick in imbibing my instructions, but displayed\r\na strong natural taste for those investigations towards which I had\r\nshown so marked a bias.\r\n\r\n\"Day after day have we sat together discoursing of the great events\r\nrecorded in Holy Writ: going over every chapter of its marvellous\r\nrecords, page by page, till the whole were so firmly fixed upon our\r\nminds, that we had no necessity during our conversations for referring\r\nto the Sacred Book.  We found examples we held up to ourselves for\r\nimitation;--we found incidents we regarded as promises of Divine\r\nProtection; we found consolation and comfort, as well as exhortation and\r\nadvice; and, moreover, we found a sort of instruction that led us to\r\nselect for ourselves duties that apparently tended to bring us nearer to\r\nthe Great Being, whose goodness we had so diligently studied.\r\n\r\n\"My father seemed as much pleased with my successful teaching, as he had\r\nbeen with my successful learning; and when young Reichardt turned out a\r\nremarkably handy and intelligent lad, to whose assistance in some of his\r\navocations he could have recourse with perfect confidence in his\r\ncleverness and discretion, he grew extremely partial to him.  Dr\r\nBrightwell also proved his friend, and in a few years, the condition of\r\nthe friendless workhouse boy was so changed, he could not have been\r\ntaken for the same person.\r\n\r\n\"He was a boy of a very grateful spirit, and always regarded me with the\r\ndevotion of a most thankful heart.  Often would he contrast the\r\nwretchedness of his previous condition with the happiness he now\r\nenjoyed, and express in the warmest terms his obligations to me for the\r\nimportant service I had rendered him in rescuing him from the abject\r\nmisery of the workhouse.  Under these circumstances, it is not\r\nextraordinary that we should learn to regard each other with the\r\nliveliest feelings of affection, and while we were still children,--\r\nendured all the transports and torments which make up the existence of\r\nmore experienced lovers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not like interrupting you,\" I here observed, \"but I certainly\r\nshould like to know what is meant by the word lovers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely explain it to you satisfactorily at present,\" said Mrs\r\nReichardt, with a smile; \"but I have no doubt, before many years have\r\npassed over your head--always provided that you escape from this\r\nisland--you will understand it without requiring any explanation.  But I\r\nmust now leave my story, as many things of much consequence to our\r\nfuture welfare now demand my careful attention.\"\r\n\r\nI could not then ascertain from her what was meant by the word whose\r\nmeaning I had asked.  It had very much excited my curiosity; but she\r\nleft me to attend to her domestic duties, of which she was extremely\r\nregardful, and I had no opportunity at that time of eliciting from her\r\nthe explanation I desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to overrate the value of Mrs Reichardt's\r\nassistance.  Indeed had it not been for her, circumstanced as I was at\r\nthis particular period, I should in all probability have perished.  Her\r\nexhortations saved me from despair, when our position seemed to have\r\ngrown quite desperate.  But example did more, even, than precept.  Her\r\ningenuity in devising expedients; her activity in putting them in force;\r\nher unfailing cheerfulness under disappointment, and Christian\r\nresignation under privation, produced the best results.  I was enabled\r\nto bear up against the ill effects of our crippled resources, consequent\r\nupon the ill conduct of the sailors of the whaler, and the failure of\r\nour fish-pond.\r\n\r\nShe manufactured strong lines for deep-sea fishing, and having\r\ndiscovered a shelf of rock, little more than two feet above the sea, to\r\nwhich with a good deal of difficulty I could descend, I took my stand\r\none day on the rock with my lines baited with a piece of one of my\r\nfeathered favourites, whom dire necessity had at last forced me to\r\ndestroy.  I waited with all the patience of a veteran angler.  I knew\r\nthe water to be very deep, and it lay in a sheltered nook or corner of\r\nthe rocks about ten feet across; I allowed the line to drop some three\r\nor four yards, and not having any float, could only tell I had a bite by\r\nfeeling a pull at the line, which was wound round my arm.\r\n\r\nAfter some time having been passed in this way, my attention was\r\nwithdrawn from the line, and given to the narrative I had so lately\r\nheard; that is to say, though my eyes were still fixed upon the line, I\r\nhad completely given up my thoughts to the story of the poor German boy,\r\nwho had been snatched from poverty by the interference of the parish\r\nclerk's daughter; and I contrived to speculate on what I should have\r\ndone under such circumstances, imagining all sorts of extravagances in\r\nwhich I should have indulged, to testify my gratitude to so amiable and\r\nbenevolent a friend.\r\n\r\nA singular course of ideal scenes followed each other in quick\r\nsuccession in my mind--as I fancied myself the hero of a similar\r\nadventure.  I regarded my imaginary benefactress with feelings of such\r\nintensity as I had never before experienced; and it seemed that I was to\r\nher the exciting object of sentiments of a like nature, the knowledge of\r\nwhich awoke in our hearts the most agreeable sensations.\r\n\r\nI was rudely disturbed out of this day-dream by finding myself suddenly\r\nplunged into the deep water beneath me.  The shock was so startling,\r\nthat some seconds elapsed before I could comprehend my situation; and\r\nthen it became clear that I must have hooked a fish, that had not only\r\nsucceeded in pulling me off my balance, but the line by which he was\r\nheld being round my arm, cutting painfully into the flesh, threatened\r\ndrowning by keeping me under water.  With great difficulty I managed to\r\nrise to the surface, and loosened the windings of the line from my limb;\r\nthen, anxious to retain possession of what from its force must have been\r\na fish well worth some trouble in catching, I held on with both hands,\r\nand pulled with all my strength.\r\n\r\nAt first, by main force I was drawn through the water; then, when I\r\nfound the strain slacken, I drew in the line.  This manoeuvre was\r\nrepeated several times, till I succeeded in obtaining a view of what I\r\nhad caught; or, more properly speaking, of what had caught me.  It was\r\nmerely a glimpse; for the fish, which was a very large one, getting a\r\nsight of me within a few yards of him, made some desperate plunges, and\r\nagain darted off, dragging me along with him, sometimes under the water,\r\nand sometimes on the surface.\r\n\r\nHis body was nearly round, and about seven or eight feet long--rather a\r\nformidable antagonist for close quarters; nevertheless, I was most eager\r\nto get at him, the more so, when I ascertained that his resistance was\r\nevidently decreasing.  I continued to approach, and at last got near\r\nenough to plunge my knife up to the haft in his head, which at once put\r\nan end to the struggle.\r\n\r\nBut now another difficulty presented itself.  In the ardour of the chase\r\nI had been drawn nearly a mile from the island, and I found it\r\nimpossible to carry back the produce of my sport, exhausted as I was by\r\nthe efforts I had made in capturing him.  I knew I could not swim with\r\nsuch a burthen for the most inconsiderable portion of the distance.  My\r\nfish therefore must be abandoned.  Here was a bountiful supply of food,\r\nas soon as placed within reach, rendered totally unavailable.\r\n\r\nI thought of Mrs Reichardt.  I thought how gratified she would have\r\nbeen, could I have brought to her such an excellent addition to our\r\nscanty stock of food.  Then I thought of her steadfast reliance upon\r\nProvidence, and what valuable lessons of piety and wisdom she would read\r\nme, if she found me depressed by my disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could disconnect my tackle from the dead fish, I turned my\r\nface homewards, and struck out manfully for the shore; luckily I did not\r\nobserve any sharks.  I landed safely without further adventure, and\r\nimmediately sought my kind friend and companion, whom I found, as usual,\r\nindustriously employed in endeavouring to secure me additional comforts.\r\nIf she were not engaged in ordinary woman's work,--making, mending,\r\ncleaning, or improving, in our habitation, she was sure to be found\r\ndoing something in the immediate neighbourhood, which, though less\r\nfeminine, showed no less forethought, prudence, and sagacity.\r\n\r\nOur garden had prospered wonderfully under her hands.  The ground seemed\r\nnow stocked with various kinds of vegetation, of which I neither knew\r\nthe value nor the proper mode of cultivation; and we seemed about to be\r\nsurrounded with shrubs and plants--many of very pleasing appearance--\r\nthat must in a short time entirely change the aspect of the place.\r\n\r\nShe heard my adventure with a good deal of interest, only remonstrating\r\nwith me upon my want of caution, and dwelling upon the fatal\r\nconsequences that must have ensued to herself, had I been drowned or\r\ndisabled by falling from the rock, or devoured by the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"You may consider yourself, my dear son,\" she observed, with serious\r\nearnestness, \"to have been under the Divine care.  Nothing can be\r\nclearer than that a wise and kind Providence is continually watching\r\nover His creatures when placed in unusual or perilous circumstances.  He\r\noccasionally affords them manifestations of His favour, to encourage\r\nthem when engaged in good works.  This shows the comprehensive eye of\r\nthe master of many workmen, who overlooks the labours of his more\r\nindustrious servants, and indicates to them his regard for their welfare\r\nand appreciation of their labours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" I interposed, \"if I had been under the superintendence of\r\nthe Providence of which you speak, I should not have been obliged to\r\nabandon so capital a fish, when I had endured such trouble to capture\r\nit, and when its possession was so necessary to our comfort, nay, even\r\nto our existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very abandonment of so unwieldy a creature,\" she replied, \"is\r\nunanswerable evidence of a Divine interposition in your favour; for had\r\nyou persisted in your intention of carrying it to the shore, there is\r\nbut little doubt that its weight would have overpowered you, and that\r\nyou would have been drowned; and then what would have become of me?  A\r\nwoman left in this desolate spot to her own resources, must soon be\r\nforced to give up the struggle for existence, from want of physical\r\nstrength.  Nevertheless, there are numerous instances on record, of\r\nwomen having surmounted hardships which few men could endure.  Supported\r\nby our Heavenly Father, who is so powerful a protector of the weak, and\r\nfriend of the helpless, the weakest of our weak sex may triumph over the\r\nmost intolerable sufferings.  I, however, am not over confident of being\r\nso supported, and therefore, I think it would be but showing a proper\r\nconsideration for your fellow exile, to act in every emergency with as\r\nmuch circumspection and prudence as possible.\"\r\n\r\nI promised that for the future I would run no such risks, and added many\r\nprofessions of regard for her safety.  They had the desired effect; I\r\npretended to think no more of my disappointment, nevertheless, I found\r\nmyself constantly dwelling on the size of my lost fish, and lamenting my\r\nbeing obliged to abandon him to his more voracious brethren of the deep.\r\nThese thoughts so filled my mind, that at night I continued to dream\r\nover again the whole incident, beginning with my patient angling from\r\nthe rock, and concluding with my disconsolate swim to shore--and pursued\r\nmy scaly antagonist quite as determinedly in my sleep as I had done in\r\nthe deep waters.\r\n\r\nI rose early, after having passed so disturbed a night, and soon made my\r\nway to the usual haunt of Nero, whom I discovered in the sea near the\r\nrocks making all sorts of strange tumblings and divings, apparently\r\nafter some dark object that was floating in the water.  I called him\r\naway, to examine what it was that had so attracted his attention, and my\r\nsurprise may be imagined when I made out the huge form of my enemy of\r\nthe preceding day.  My shouts and exclamations of joy soon brought Mrs\r\nReichardt to the scene, and when she discovered the shape of this\r\nprodigious fish, her surprise seemed scarcely less than my own.\r\n\r\nHow to land him was our first consideration; and after some debate on\r\nthe ways and means, I got a rope and leaped into the water with it,\r\nfastened a noose round his gills, and then swimming back and climbing\r\nthe rock, we jointly tried to pull him up on to the shore.  We hauled\r\nand tugged with all our force for a considerable time, but to very\r\nlittle effect; he was too heavy to pull up perpendicularly.  At last we\r\nmanaged to drag him to a low piece of rock, and there I divided him into\r\nseveral pieces, which Mrs Reichardt carried away to dry and preserve in\r\nsome way that she said would make the fish capital eating all the year\r\nround.\r\n\r\nIt was very palatable when dressed by her, and as she changed the manner\r\nof cooking several times, I never got tired of it.  By its flavour, as\r\nfar as I could judge from subsequent knowledge, the creature was\r\nsomething of the sturgeon kind of fish; but its proper name I never\r\ncould learn; nor was I ever able to catch another, therefore, I must\r\npresume that it was a stranger in those seas.  Nevertheless, he proved\r\nmost acceptable to us both, for we should have fared but ill for some\r\ntime, had it not been for his providential capture.\r\n\r\nIt was one afternoon, when we had been enjoying a capital meal at the\r\nexpense of our great friend, that I led the subject to Mrs Reichardt's\r\nadventures, subsequently to where she broke off in the story of herself\r\nand the poor German boy; and though not without considerable reluctance,\r\nI induced her to proceed with her narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\n\"Our good minister Dr Brightwell,\" she commenced, \"was a man of\r\nconsiderable scholastic attainments, and he delighted in making a\r\ndisplay of them.  At one time he had been master of an extensive grammar\r\nschool, and now he employed a good deal of his leisure in teaching those\r\nboys and girls of the town, who indicated the possession of anything\r\nlike talent.  The overseers used to talk jestingly to my father, of the\r\nDoctor teaching ploughboys Greek and Latin; and wenches, whose chief\r\nemployment was stone-picking in the fields, geography and the use of the\r\nglobes.  Even the churchwardens shook their heads, and privately thought\r\nthe Rector a little out of his seven senses, for wasting his learning\r\nupon such unprofitable scholars.  Nevertheless, he continued his\r\nself-imposed task, without meeting any reward beyond the satisfaction of\r\nhis own conscience.  It was not till he added to his pupils myself and\r\nyoung Reichardt, he felt he was doing his duty with some prospect of\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of emulation roused both of us to make extraordinary efforts\r\nto second our worthy master's endeavours: and this did not, as is\r\nusually the case, proceed from rivalry--it arose entirely from a desire\r\nof the one to stand well in the estimation of the other.  In this way we\r\nlearned the French and Latin languages, geography, and the usual\r\nbranches of a superior education: but our bias was more particularly for\r\nreligions knowledge, and our preceptor encouraged this, till we were\r\nalmost as good theologians as himself.\r\n\r\n\"While this information was being carefully arranged and digested, there\r\nsprung up in our hearts so deep a devotion for each other, that we were\r\nmiserable when absent, and enjoyed no gratification so much as being in\r\neach other's society.  We knew not then the full power and meaning of\r\nthis preference, but as we changed from boy and girlhood to adult life,\r\nour feelings developed themselves into that attachment between the\r\nsexes, which from time immemorial has received the name of love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know what that means, now,\" said I, as my day-dream, which\r\nwas so rudely disturbed by my fall into the sea, occurred to me.\r\n\r\n\"It would be strange if you did,\" she replied, \"considering that it is\r\nquite impossible you should have become acquainted with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am certain I understand it very well,\" I rejoined, more\r\nconfidently, and then added, not without some embarrassment, \"If I were\r\nplaced in the position of Heinrich Reichardt, I am quite sure I should\r\nfeel towards any young female who was so kind to me, the deepest regard\r\nand affection.  I should like to be constantly near her, and should\r\nalways desire that she should like me better than any one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite as good an explanation of the matter, as I could expect\r\nfrom you,\" she observed, smiling.  \"But to return to my story.  Our\r\nmutual attachment attracted general attention, and was the subject of\r\nmuch observation.  But we had no enemies: and when we were met strolling\r\ntogether in the shady lanes, gathering wild flowers, or wandering\r\nthrough the woods in search of wild strawberries, no one thought it\r\nnecessary to make any remark if we had our arms round each other's\r\nwaist.  My father, if he heard anything about it, did not interfere.\r\nYoung Reichardt had made himself so useful to him, and showed himself so\r\nremarkably clever in everything he undertook, that the old man loved him\r\nas his own son.\r\n\r\n\"It was a settled thing between us, that we were to become man and wife,\r\nas soon as we should be permitted.  And many were our plans and schemes\r\nfor the future.  Heinrich considered himself to be in the position of\r\nJacob, who served such a long and patient apprenticeship for Rachel; and\r\nthough he confessed he should not like to wait so long for his wife as\r\nthe patriarch had been made to do, he acknowledged he would rather serve\r\nmy father to the full period, than give up all hope of possessing me.\r\n\r\n\"This happy state of things was, however, suddenly put an end to, by Dr\r\nBrightwell one day sending for my father.  It was a long time before he\r\ncame back, and when he did, he looked unusually grave and reserved.  In\r\nan hour or so, he communicated to me the result of his long interview\r\nwith the Rector.  The Doctor had resolved to send young Reichardt to a\r\ndistant place, where many learned men lived together in colleges, for\r\nthe purpose of farther advancing his education, and fitting him for a\r\nreligious teacher, to which vocation he had long expressed a desire to\r\ndevote himself.  The idea of separation seemed very terrible, but I at\r\nlast got reconciled to it, in the belief that it would be greatly for\r\nHeinrich's advantage, and we parted at last with many tears, many\r\nprotestations, some fears, but a great many more hopes.\r\n\r\n\"For some days after he had left me, everything seemed so strange, every\r\none seemed so dull, every place seemed so desolate, that I felt as if I\r\nhad been transported into some dismal scene, where I knew no one, and\r\nwhere there was no one likely to care about me in the slightest degree.\r\nMy father went about his avocations in a different spirit to what he had\r\nso long been used to exhibit; it was evident he missed Heinrich as much\r\nas I did, and the villagers stared whenever I passed them, as though my\r\never going about without Heinrich was something which they had never\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n\"In course of time, however, to all appearance, everything and every one\r\nwent on in their daily course, as though no Heinrich had ever been heard\r\nof.  My father would sometimes, when overpressed by business, refer to\r\nthe able assistant he had lost, and now and then I heard a conjecture\r\nhazarded by some one or other of his most confidential friends, as to\r\nwhat young Reichardt was doing with himself.  My conjectures, and my\r\nreferences to him, were far from being so occasional; there was scarce\r\nan hour of the day I did not think of him; but, believing that I should\r\nplease him most by endeavouring to improve as much as possible during\r\nhis absence, I did not give myself up to idle reflections respecting the\r\npast, or anticipations, equally idle, respecting the future.\r\n\r\n\"My great delight was in hearing from him.  At first, his letters\r\nexpressed only his feelings for me; then he dwelt more largely on his\r\nown exertions for preparing himself for the profession he desired to\r\nadopt; and after a time, his correspondence was almost entirely composed\r\nof expositions of his views of a religious life, and dissertations on\r\nvarious points of doctrine.  He evidently was growing more enthusiastic\r\nin religion, and less regardful of our attachment.\r\n\r\n\"Yet I entertained no apprehensions or misgivings.  I did not think it\r\nnecessary to consider myself slighted because the thoughts of my future\r\nhusband were evidently raised more and more above me; the knowledge of\r\nthis only made me more anxious to raise myself more and more towards the\r\nelevation to which his thoughts were so intently directed.\r\n\r\n\"Things went on in this way for two or three years.  I never saw him all\r\nthis time; I heard from him but seldom.  He excused his limited\r\ncorrespondence on the plea that his studies left him no time for\r\nwriting.  I never blamed him for this apparent neglect--indeed I rather\r\nencouraged it, for my exhortations were always that he should address\r\nhis time and energies towards the attainment of the object I knew him to\r\nhave so much at heart--his becoming a minister of our Lord's Gospel.\r\n\r\n\"One day my father came home from the rectory with a troubled\r\ncountenance.  Dr Brightwell was very indignant because Heinrich had\r\njoined a religious community that dissented from the Articles of the\r\nChurch of England.  The Doctor had offered to get him employment in the\r\nChurch, if he would give up his new connections: but the more earnest\r\ncharacter of his new faith exerted so much influence over his\r\nenthusiastic nature, that he willingly abandoned his bright prospects to\r\nbecome a more humble labourer in a less productive vineyard.\r\n\r\n\"My father, as the clerk of the parish, seemed to think himself bound to\r\nshare in the indignation of his pastor for this desertion, and Heinrich\r\nwas severely condemned by him for displaying such ingratitude to his\r\nbenefactor: I was commanded to think no more of him.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, was not so easy a matter, although our correspondence\r\nappeared to have entirely ceased.  I knew not where to address a letter\r\nto him, and was quite unaware of what his future career was now to be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\n\"Time passed on.  With all, except myself, Heinrich Reichardt appeared\r\nto be forgotten; in the opinion of all, except myself, he had forgotten\r\nour house, and all the friends he had once made there.  Our good rector\r\nhad been removed by death from the post he had so ably filled; and my\r\nfather being incapacitated by age and infirmity from attending his\r\nduties in the church, had his place filled by another.  He had saved\r\nsufficient to live upon, and had built himself a small cottage at the\r\nend of the village, where we lived together in perfect peace, if not in\r\nperfect happiness.\r\n\r\n\"I had long grown up to womanhood, and having some abilities, had been\r\nemployed as one of the teachers of the girls' school, of which I had\r\nraised myself to be mistress.  I conducted myself so as to win the\r\nrespect of the chief parochial officers, from more than one of whom I\r\nreceived proposals of marriage: but I never could reconcile myself to\r\nthe idea of becoming the wife of any man but the long-absent Heinrich,\r\nand the new clerk and the overseer were fain to be content with my\r\ngrateful rejection of their proposals.\r\n\r\n\"I determined to wait patiently till I could learn from Heinrich's own\r\nlips that he had abandoned his early friend.  I could never get myself\r\nto believe in the possibility of his unfaithfulness; and the\r\nremembrances of our mutual studies in the Book of Truth seemed always to\r\nsuggest the impossibility of his acting so completely at variance with\r\nthe impressions he had thence received.\r\n\r\n\"I was aware that if I had mentioned my hopes of his one day coming to\r\nclaim me, I should be laughed at by every one who knew anything of our\r\nstory--so I said nothing, but continued the more devotedly in my heart\r\nto cherish that faith which had so long afforded me support against the\r\noverwhelming evidence of prolonged silence and neglect.\r\n\r\n\"There was a congregation of Dissenters in the town, and I had been once\r\nor twice prevailed on to join their devotions.  One day I heard that\r\nproceedings of extraordinary interest would take place at the\r\nmeeting-house.  A minister of great reputation had accepted the\r\nsituation of Missionary to preach the Gospel to the heathen, and he was\r\nvisiting the different congregations that lay in his route to the\r\nseaport whence he was to embark to the Sandwich Islands.  He was\r\nexpected to address a discourse to the Dissenters of our parish, and I\r\nwas induced to go and hear him.\r\n\r\n\"The meeting-house was very much crowded, but I contrived to get a seat\r\nwithin a short distance of the speakers, and waited with much interest\r\nto behold the man, who, like some of the first preachers, had chosen the\r\nperilous task of endeavouring to convert a nation of savage idolaters to\r\nthe faith of the true Christ.\r\n\r\n\"After a short delay he appeared on a raised platform, and was\r\nintroduced to this congregation by their minister.  I heard nothing of\r\nthis introduction, though it seemed a long one; I saw nothing of the\r\nspeaker, though his was a figure which always attracted an attentive\r\naudience.  I saw only the stranger.  In those pale, grave, and serious\r\nfeatures then presented to me, I recognised Heinrich Reichardt.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had come back to you at last,\" I exclaimed; \"I thought he would.\r\nAfter all you had done for the poor German boy, it was impossible that\r\nhe should grow up to manhood and forget you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear,\" she replied.  \"For some time my heart beat wildly, and\r\nI thought I should be obliged to leave the place, my sensations became\r\nso overpowering; but the fear of disturbing the congregation, and of\r\nattracting attention towards myself, had such influence over me, that I\r\nmanaged to retain sufficient control over my feelings to remain quiet.\r\nNevertheless my eyes were upon Heinrich, and my whole heart and soul\r\nwere exclusively engrossed by him while he continued before me.\r\n\r\n\"Presently he began to speak.  As I have just said, I paid no attention\r\nto the preliminary proceedings.  I know nothing of the manner in which\r\nhe was introduced to his audience; but when he became the speaker, every\r\nword fell upon my ear with a distinctness that seemed quite marvellous\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"And how could it be otherwise?  His tall figure, his melancholy yet\r\nexpressive features, his earnest manner, and clear and sonorous voice,\r\ninvested him with all the power and dignity of an Apostle, and when with\r\nthese attributes were joined those associations of the past with which\r\nhe was so intimately connected, it is impossible to exaggerate the\r\ninfluence he exercised over me.\r\n\r\n\"He began with a fervent blessing on all who had sought the sanctity of\r\nthat roof, and his hearers, impressed with the thrilling earnestness of\r\nhis delivery, became at once hushed into a kind of awe-struck attention.\r\nThey knelt down, and bowed their heads in prayer.\r\n\r\n\"I appeared to have no power to follow the general example, but remained\r\nthe only sitter in the entire congregation, with my eyes, nay, all my\r\nsenses, fixed, riveted upon the preacher.  This, of course, attracted\r\nhis attention.  I saw him look towards me with surprise, then he\r\nstarted, his voice hesitated for a moment, but he almost immediately\r\ncontinued his benediction, and, as it seemed to me, with a voice\r\ntremulous with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Then followed a discourse on the object of the preacher in presenting\r\nhimself there.  He described the wonderful goodness of the Creator in\r\ncontinually raising up the most humble instruments of His will to\r\nperform the most important offices; in illustration of which he referred\r\nto the numerous instances in the Old and New Testaments, where God's\r\npreference in this way is so clearly manifested.\r\n\r\n\"He then stated that a case had arisen for Divine interposition, equal\r\nin necessity to any which had occurred since the first commencement of\r\nChristianity.  He explained that there were nations still existing in a\r\ndistant portion of the globe in a state of the wildest barbarism.\r\nIgnorant savages were they, with many cruel and idolatrous customs, who\r\nwere cannibals and murderers, and given up to the worst vices of the\r\nheathen.  Their abject and pitiable state, he told us, the Lord God had\r\nwitnessed with Divine commiseration, and had determined that the light\r\nof Christian love should shine upon their darkness, and that Almighty\r\nwisdom should dissipate their besotted ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"`But who,' he asked, `was to be the ambassador from so stupendous a\r\nPower to these barbarous states?  Who would venture to be a messenger of\r\npeace and comfort to a cruel and savage nation?  Was there no man,' he\r\nagain asked, `great enough and bold enough to undertake a mission of\r\nsuch vast importance, attended by such terrible risks?\r\n\r\n\"`The Almighty Ruler seeks not for his ministers among the great and\r\nbold,' he added, `as it is written, \"He hath put down the mighty from\r\ntheir seats, and hath exalted the humble and meek.\"  And it will be\r\npeculiarly so on this occasion, for the exaltation is from the humblest\r\norigin; so humble it is scarcely possible to imagine so miserable a\r\nbeginning, in the end attaining distinction so honourable.\r\n\r\n\"`Imagine, if you can, my brethren,' he said, `in the building set apart\r\nin your town for the reception of your destitute poor, a child\r\nparentless, friendless, and moneyless, condemned, as it seemed, to\r\nperpetual raggedness and intolerable suffering.  A ministering angel,\r\nunder the direction of the Supreme Goodness, took that child by the hand\r\nand led it out of the pauper walls that inclosed it, and under its\r\nauspices the child grew and flourished, and learned all that was\r\nexcellent in faith and admirable in practice.\r\n\r\n\"`It was ordained that he should lose sight of his angelic teacher.  A\r\ndire necessity compelled him to withdraw from that pure and gracious\r\ninfluence.  He had to learn in a different school, and prepare himself\r\nfor heavier tasks.  Manhood, with all its severe responsibilities, came\r\nupon him.  He sought first to render himself competent for some holy\r\nundertaking, before he could consider himself worthy again to claim that\r\nnotice which had made him what he was.  Earnestly he strove for the\r\nDivine assistance and encouragement; and as his qualifications\r\nincreased, his estimate of the worthiness necessary for the object he\r\nhad in view, became more and more exalted.\r\n\r\n\"`At last,' he continued, `it became known to him that a Missionary was\r\nrequired to explain to the savage people to whom I have already alluded,\r\nthe principles of Christianity.  He was appointed to this sacred trust;\r\nand he then determined, before he left this country for the distant one\r\nof his ministry, to present himself before that beneficent being who had\r\npoured out before him so abundant a measure of Christian virtue; that\r\nthey might be joined together in the same great vocation, and support\r\neach other in the same important trust.'\r\n\r\n\"I heard enough,\" continued Mrs Reichardt.  \"All was explained, and I\r\nwas fully satisfied.  The discourse proceeded to identify the speaker\r\nwith the poor boy who had been preserved for such onerous duties.  Then\r\ncame an appeal to the congregation for their prayers, and such\r\nassistance as they could afford, to advance so holy a work as the\r\nconversion of the heathen.\r\n\r\n\"I was in such a tumult of pleasant feelings, that I retained but a\r\nconfused recollection of the subsequent events.  I only remember that as\r\nI was walking home from the meeting, I heard footsteps quickly\r\nfollowing; in a few minutes more the voice that had so lately filled my\r\nheart to overflowing with happiness, again addressed me.  I was too much\r\nexcited to remain unconcerned on suddenly discovering that Heinrich was\r\nso near, and I fell fainting into his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I was carried into a neighbouring cottage, but in a short time was\r\nenabled to proceed home.  In a week afterwards we were married: a few\r\ndays more sufficed for the preparations that were required for my\r\ndestination, and then we proceeded to the port, and embarked on board\r\nthe ship that was to take us over many thousand miles of sea, to the\r\nwild, unknown country that was to be the scene of our mission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt was obliged to break off her narrative, where it\r\nconcluded at the end of the last chapter.  As I have said, her household\r\nduties being very numerous, and requiring a great deal of attention,\r\ntook up nearly the whole of her time.\r\n\r\nThe garden now presented a most agreeable appearance, possessing several\r\ndifferent kinds of vegetables, and various plants that had been raised\r\nfrom seed.  We had succeeded in raising several young orange-trees from\r\nthe pips she had brought in her basket: and they promised to supply us\r\nwith plenty of their luscious fruit.  Even the peas we thought so dry\r\nand useless had germinated, and provided us with a welcome addition to\r\nour table.  I shall never forget the first day she added to our scanty\r\nmeal of dried fish a dish of smoking potatoes fresh out of the moist\r\nearth.  After enjoying sufficiently my wonder at their appearance, and\r\ndelight at their agreeable taste, she informed me of their first\r\nintroduction into Europe, and their gradual diffusion over the more\r\ncivilised portions of the globe.\r\n\r\nI speak of Europe now, because I had learned from my companion, not only\r\na good deal of geography, but had obtained some insight into several\r\nother branches of knowledge.  In particular, she had told me much\r\ninteresting information about England, much more than I had learnt from\r\nJackson; dwelling upon its leading features, and the most remarkable\r\nportions of its history; and I must acknowledge that I felt a secret\r\npride in belonging to so great a country.\r\n\r\nI considered that I belonged to it, for my father and mother were\r\nEnglish, and though I might be called The Little Savage, and be fixed to\r\nan obscure island in the great ocean, I felt that my real home was in\r\nthis great country my mother talked about so glowingly, and that my\r\nchief object ought to be to return into the hands of my grandfather, the\r\nbelt that had in so singular a manner come into my possession.\r\n\r\nI often thought of this great England whose glory had been so widely\r\nspread and so durably established, and longed for some means of leaving\r\nour present abode, and going in search of its time-honoured shores.  But\r\nI asked myself how was this desirable object to be effected?  We had no\r\nmeans of transporting ourselves from the prison into which we had been\r\naccidentally cast.  We had nothing resembling a boat on the island, and\r\nwe had no tools for making one; and even had we been put in possession\r\nof such a treasure, we had no means of launching it.  The rocky\r\ncharacter of the coast made the placing of a boat on the water almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe expectation of a vessel appearing off the island appeared quite as\r\nunreasonable.  We had seen no ships for a long time, and those we had\r\nobserved, were a great deal too far off to heed our signals.\r\n\r\nWe had no help for it, but to trust to Providence and bear our present\r\nevil patiently.  Nevertheless, I took my glass and swept the sea far and\r\nwide in search of a ship, but failed to discover anything but a\r\nspermaceti whale blowing in the distance, or a shoal of porpoises\r\ntumbling over each other nearer the shore, or a colony of seals basking\r\nin the sun on the rocks nearest the sea.  My disappointment was shared\r\nby Nero, who seemed to regard my vexation with a sympathising glance,\r\nand even the gannets turned their dull stupid gaze upon me, with an\r\nexpression as if they deeply commiserated my distress.\r\n\r\nI had for a long time employed myself in making a shelving descent to\r\nthe sea, on the most secure part of the rock, intending that it should\r\nbe a landing-place for a boat, in case any ship should come near enough\r\nto send one to our rescue.  It was a work of great labour, and hatchet\r\nand spade equally suffered in my endeavours to effect my object; but at\r\nlast I contrived to take advantage of a natural fracture in the rock,\r\nand a subsequent fall of the cliff, to make a rude kind of inclined\r\nplane, rather too steep and too rough for bad climbers, but extremely\r\nconvenient for my mother and me, whenever we should be prepared to\r\nembark for our distant home.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts were now often directed to the possibility of making on the\r\nisland some kind of boat that would hold ourselves and sufficient\r\nprovisions for a voyage to the nearest of the larger islands.  I spoke\r\nto Mrs Reichardt on the subject, but she dwelt upon the impossibility,\r\nwithout either proper tools, or the slightest knowledge of\r\nboat-building, of producing a vessel to which we could trust ourselves\r\nwith any confidence, neither of us knowing anything about its management\r\nin the open sea; and then she spoke of the dangers a small boat would\r\nmeet with, if the water should be rough, or if we should not be able to\r\nmake the island in any reasonable time.\r\n\r\nYet I was not daunted by difficulties, nor dissuaded by discouraging\r\nrepresentations.  I thought at first of fastening all the loose timber\r\ntogether that had drifted against the rocks, as much in the shape of a\r\nboat as I could get it; but on looking over my stock of nails, I found\r\nthey fell very far short of the proper quantity; consequently that mode\r\nof effecting my purpose was abandoned.\r\n\r\nI then thought of felling a tree and hollowing it out by charring the\r\ntimber.  As yet I had discovered nothing on the island but shrubs.  I\r\nwas quite certain that no tree grew near enough to the sea to be\r\navailable, and if I should succeed in cutting down a large one and\r\nfashioning it as I desired, I had no means of transport.\r\n\r\nI might possibly make a boat capable of carrying all I wanted to put\r\ninto it, but as I could neither move the water up to the boat, nor the\r\nboat down to the water, for all the service I wanted of it, even if the\r\nisland contained a tree large enough, I might just as well leave it\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nStill I would not altogether abandon my favourite project.  I thought of\r\nthe willows that grew on the island, and fancied I could make a\r\nframework by twisting them strongly together, and stretching seal-skins\r\nover them.  I laboured at this for several weeks, exercising all my\r\ningenuity and no slight stock of patience, to create an object with\r\nwhich I was but imperfectly acquainted.\r\n\r\nI did succeed at last in putting together something in a remote degree\r\nresembling the boat that brought part of the whaler's crew to the island\r\nand had taken them away, but it was not a quarter the size and was so\r\nlight that I could carry it without much difficulty to the landing I had\r\nconstructed on the cliff.  When I came to try its capabilities, I found\r\nit terribly lopsided--it soon began to leak, and in fact it exhibited so\r\nmany faults, that I was forced to drag it again on shore, and take it to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nI called in Mrs Reichardt to my assistance, and though at first she\r\nseemed averse to the experiment, she gave me a great deal of information\r\nrespecting the structure of small boats, and the method of waterproofing\r\nleather and other fabrics.  I attended carefully to all she said, and\r\ncommenced rebuilding with more pretensions to art.\r\n\r\nI now made a strong framework, tolerably sharp at each end, and as\r\nnearly as possible resembling a keel at the bottom.  I covered this on\r\nboth sides with pieces of strong cloth saturated with grease from the\r\ncarcases of birds, and then covered the whole with well-dried\r\nseal-skins, which I had made impervious to wet.  The inside of the boat\r\nnearest the water I neatly covered with pieces of dry bark, over which I\r\nfixed some boards, which had floated to the island from wrecked ships.\r\nFinally I put in some benches to sit on, and then fancied I had done\r\neverything that was necessary.\r\n\r\nI soon got her into the fishing-pool, and was delighted to find that she\r\nfloated capitally--but I still had a great deal to do.  I had made\r\nneither oars to propel her through the water, nor sail to carry her\r\nthrough the waves, when rowing was impossible.  I remembered the\r\nwhaler's spare oars and mizen, but they were too large; nevertheless,\r\nthey served me as models to work upon, and in time I made a rough pair\r\nof paddles or oars, which, though rudely fashioned, I hoped would answer\r\nthe purpose pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty was how to use the oars, and I made many awkward\r\nattempts before I ascertained the proper method of proceeding.  Again my\r\ncompanion, on whom nothing which had once passed before her eyes had\r\npassed in vain, showed me how the boat should be managed.\r\n\r\nIn a short time I could row about the pool with sufficient dexterity to\r\nturn the boat in any direction I required, and I then took Nero as a\r\npassenger, and he seemed to enjoy the new gratification with a\r\npraiseworthy decorum; till, when I was trying to turn the boat round,\r\nthe movement caused him to attempt to shift his quarters, which he did\r\nwith so little attention to the build of our vessel, that in one moment\r\nshe was capsized, and in the next we were swimming about in the pool\r\nwith our vessel bottom upwards.\r\n\r\nAs she was so light, I soon righted her, and found that she had received\r\nno injury, and appeared to be perfectly water-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nI could not prevail upon Mrs Reichardt to embark in my craft, the fate\r\nof my first passenger, which she had witnessed from the shore, had\r\ndeterred her from attempting a voyage under such unpromising\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had dried my clothes, I was for making another experiment,\r\nand one too of a more hazardous nature.  I would not be parted from\r\nNero, but I made him lie at the bottom of the boat, where I could have\r\nhim under strict control.  With him I also took my little flock of\r\ngannets, who perched themselves round me, gazing about them with an air\r\nof such singular stupidity as they were being propelled through the\r\nwater, that I could not help bursting out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Mrs Reichardt, \"such a boat's crew and such a boat had\r\nnever been seen in those seas before.  A young Savage as captain, a tame\r\nseal as boatswain, and a flock of gannets as sailors, certainly made up\r\nas curious a set of adventurers as ever floated upon the wide ocean.\"\r\n\r\nI was not the least remarkable of the strange group, for I had nothing\r\non but a pair of duck trousers, patched in several places; and my hair,\r\nwhich had grown very long, hung in black wavy masses to my shoulders.\r\nMy skin was tanned by the sun to a light brown, very different from the\r\ncomplexion of Mrs Reichardt, which had ever been remarkable for its\r\npaleness.  Indeed she told me I should find some difficulty in\r\nestablishing my claim to the title of European, but none at all to that\r\nof Little Savage, which she often playfully called me.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in this trim, and with these companions, I passed out of\r\nthe fishing-pool into the sea, with the intention of rowing round the\r\nisland.  Mrs Reichardt waved her hand as I departed on my voyage,\r\nhaving exhorted me to be very careful, as long as I was in hearing; she\r\nthen turned away, as I thought, to return to the hut.\r\n\r\nThe day was remarkably fine.  There was not so much as a cloud on the\r\nhorizon, and scarcely a ripple on the water: therefore, everything\r\nseemed to favour my project, for if there had been anything of a breeze,\r\nthe beating of the waves against the rock would have been a great\r\nobstacle to my pursuing my voyage with either comfort or safety.  The\r\nwater too was so clear, that although it was of great depth, I could\r\ndistinguish the shells that lay on the sand, and observe various kinds\r\nof fish, some of most curious shape, that rushed rapidly beneath the\r\nboat as it was urged along.\r\n\r\nI was delighted with the motion, and with the agreeable appearance of\r\nthe different novelties that met my gaze.  The light boat glided almost\r\nimperceptibly through the water at every stroke of the oar.  Nero lay as\r\nstill as if his former lesson had taught him the necessity of remaining\r\nmotionless; and the gannets now and then expressed their satisfaction by\r\na shrill cry or a rapid fluttering of their wings.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we passed on without any adventure, till I found it\r\nnecessary for me to row some distance out to sea, to round a projecting\r\nrock that stood like a mighty wall before me.  I pulled accordingly, and\r\nthen had a better opportunity of seeing the island than I had ever\r\nobtained.  I recognised all the favourite places--the ravine, the wood,\r\nthe hut covered with beautiful creepers, and the garden, full of\r\nflowers, looked very agreeable to the eye: but every part seemed to look\r\npleasant, except the great savage rocks which inclosed the island on\r\nevery side: but even these I thought had an air of grandeur that gave\r\nadditional effect to the scene.\r\n\r\nMuch to my surprise, I recognised Mrs Reichardt walking rapidly towards\r\na part of the shore, near which I should be obliged to pass.  From this\r\nI saw that she was intent on watching me from point to point, to know\r\nthe worst, if any accident should befall me, and be at hand should there\r\nbe a necessity for rendering assistance.  I shouted to her, and she\r\nwaved her hand in reply.\r\n\r\nOn rounding the headland, my astonishment was extreme on finding my\r\nlittle bark in the midst of a shoal of enormous sharks.  If I came in\r\ncontact with one of them, I was lost, for the frail boat would certainly\r\nbe upset, and as Jackson had assured me, if ever I allowed these\r\nmonsters to come near enough, one snap of their jaws, and there would be\r\nan end of the Little Savage.  I thought of the warning of Mrs\r\nReichardt, and was inclined to think I had better have taken her advice,\r\nand remained in the fishing-pool; nevertheless, I went on as quietly and\r\ndeliberately as possible, exercising all my skill to keep clear of my\r\nunexpected enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was not till I had got into the middle of the shoal, that the sharks\r\nseemed to be aware there was anything unusual in their neighbourhood;\r\nbut as soon as they were fully aware of the presence of an intruder,\r\nthey exhibited the most extraordinary excitement, rushing together in\r\ngroups, with such rapid motion, that the water became so agitated, I was\r\nobliged to exercise all my skill to keep the boat steady on her course.\r\n\r\nThey dived, and rushed to and fro, and jostled each other, as I thought,\r\nin anything but an amicable spirit; still, however, keeping at a\r\nrespectful distance from the boat, for which I was extremely thankful.\r\nI urged her on with all my strength, for the purpose of getting away\r\nfrom such unpleasant neighbours; but they were not to be so easily\r\ndisposed of.  They came swimming after the boat, then when within a few\r\nyards dived, and in a moment they were before it, as if to bar any\r\nfurther progress.\r\n\r\nI however pushed on, and they disappeared, but immediately afterwards\r\nrose on all sides of me.  They were evidently getting more confidence; a\r\nfact I ascertained with no slight apprehension, for they began to\r\napproach nearer, and their gambols threatened every minute to overwhelm\r\nmy poor craft, that, light as a cork, bounced up and down the agitated\r\nwaves, as if quite as much alarmed for our safety as ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe captain was not the only one who began to fear evil; the gannets\r\nwere very restless, and it was only by strong admonitions I could\r\nprevail on Nero to retain his recumbent attitude at my feet; their\r\ninstinct warned them of approaching danger, and I felt the comfortable\r\nassurance that my own rashness had brought me into my present critical\r\nposition, and that if the menaced destruction did arrive, there was no\r\nsort of assistance at hand on which I could rely.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the sharks became more violent in their demonstrations, and\r\nmore bold in their approaches, and I could scarcely keep the boat going,\r\nor prevent the water rushing over her sides.  The gannets having shown\r\nthemselves for some minutes uneasy, had at last flown away to the\r\nneighbouring rock, and Nero began to growl and snap, as though\r\nmeditating a forcible release from his prostrate position, to see what\r\nmischief was brewing.\r\n\r\nAs I was coaxing him to be quiet, I felt a tremendous blow given to the\r\nboat, evidently from beneath, and she rose into the air several yards,\r\nscattering Nero and myself, and the oars, in different directions.\r\n\r\nThe noise we made in falling, appeared for the instant to have scattered\r\nthe creatures, for I had struck out for the rock and nearly reached it\r\nbefore a shark made its appearance.\r\n\r\nJust then I saw a large monster rushing towards me.  I thought all was\r\nover.  He turned to open his great jaws, and in another instant I should\r\nhave been devoured.\r\n\r\nAt that critical period I saw a second object dart in between me and the\r\nshark, and attack the latter fiercely.  It was Nero, and it was the last\r\nI ever saw of my faithful friend.  His timely interposition enabled me\r\nto reach a ledge in the cliff, where I was in perfect safety, hanging by\r\nsome strong seaweed, although my feet nearly touched the water, and I\r\ncould retain my position only with the greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe whole shoal were presently around me.  They at first paid their\r\nattentions to the boat and the oars, which they buffeted about till they\r\nwere driven close to the rock, at a little distance from the place where\r\nI had found temporary safety.  They left these things unharmed as soon\r\nas they caught sight of me, and then their eagerness and violence\r\nreturned with tenfold fury.  They darted towards me in a body, and I was\r\nobliged to lift my legs, or I should have had them snapped off by one or\r\nother of the twenty gaping jaws that were thrust over each other, in\r\ntheir eagerness to make a mouthful of my limbs.\r\n\r\nThis game was carried on for some minutes of horrible anxiety to me.  I\r\nfancied that my struggles had loosened the seaweed, and that in a few\r\nminutes it must give way, and I should then be fought for and torn to\r\npieces by the ravenous crew beneath.  I shouted with all the strength of\r\nmy lungs to scare them away; but as if they were as well aware that I\r\ncould not escape them as I was myself, they merely left off their\r\nviolent efforts to reach my projecting legs, and forming a semicircle\r\nround me, watched with upturned eyes, that seemed to possess a fiendish\r\nexpression that fascinated and bewildered me, the snapping of the frail\r\nhold that supported me upon the rock.\r\n\r\nIn my despair I prayed heartily, but it was rather to commend my soul to\r\nmy Maker, than with any prospect of being rescued from so imminent and\r\nhorrible a peril.  The eyes of the ravenous monsters below seemed to\r\nmock my devotion.  I felt the roots of the seaweed giving way: the\r\nslightest struggle on my part would, I knew, only hasten my dissolution,\r\nand I resigned myself to my fate.\r\n\r\nIn this awful moment I heard a voice calling out my name.  It was Mrs\r\nReichardt on the cliff high above me.  I answered with all the eagerness\r\nof despair.  Then there came a heavy splash into the water, and I heard\r\nher implore me to endeavour to make for a small shrub that grew in a\r\nhollow of the rock, at a very short distance from the tuft of seaweed\r\nthat had become so serviceable.\r\n\r\nI looked down.  The sharks had all disappeared; I knew, however, that\r\nthey would shortly return, and lost not a moment in making an effort to\r\nbetter my position in the manner I had been directed.  Mrs Reichardt\r\nhad thrown a heavy stone into the water among the sharks, the loud\r\nsplash of which had driven them away.  Before they again made their\r\nappearance, I had caught a firm hold of the twig, and flung myself up\r\ninto a position of perfect safety.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God he's safe!\"  I heard Mrs Reichardt exclaim.\r\n\r\nThe sharks did return; but when they found their anticipated prey had\r\nescaped, they swam lazily out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"Are you much hurt, Frank Henniker?\" she presently cried out to me.\r\n\r\n\"I have not a scratch,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then thank God for your deliverance,\" she added.\r\n\r\nI did thank God, and Mrs Reichardt joined with me in prayer, and a more\r\nfervent thanksgiving than was ours, it is scarcely possible to imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nI had several times pressed Mrs Reichardt for the conclusion of her\r\nstory, but she had always seemed reluctant to resume the subject.  It\r\nwas evidently full of painful incidents, and she shrunk from dwelling\r\nupon them.  At last, one evening we were sitting together, she working\r\nwith her needle and I employed upon a net she had taught me how to\r\nmanufacture, and I again led the conversation to the narrative my\r\ncompanion had left unfinished.  She sighed heavily and looked\r\ndistressed.\r\n\r\n\"It is but natural you should expect this of me, my son,\" she said; \"but\r\nyou little know the suffering caused by my recalling the melancholy\r\nevents that I have to detail.  However, I have led you to expect the\r\nentire relation, and, therefore, I will endeavour to realise your\r\nanticipations.\"\r\n\r\nI assured her I was ready to wait, whenever it might be agreeable for\r\nher to narrate the termination of her interesting history.\r\n\r\n\"It will never be agreeable to me,\" she replied mournfully; \"indeed I\r\nwould forget it if I could; but that is impossible.  The struggle may as\r\nwell be made now, as at any time.  I will therefore commence by\r\ninforming you, that during our long voyage to the Sandwich Islands, I\r\nfound ample opportunity for studying the disposition of my husband.  He\r\nwas much changed since he first left me, but his was still the same\r\ngrateful nature, full of truth and purity, that had won me towards him\r\nwhen a child.  A holy enthusiasm seemed now to exalt him above ordinary\r\nhumanity.  I could scarcely ever get him to talk upon any but religious\r\nsubjects, and those he treated in so earnest and exalted a manner, that\r\nit was impossible to avoid being carried away with his eloquence.\r\n\r\n\"He seemed to feel the greatness of his destination, as though it had\r\nraised him to an equality with the adventurous saints, who established\r\nthe banner of Christ among the Pagan nations of Europe.  He was fond of\r\ndilating upon the importance of his mission, and of dwelling on the\r\nfavour that had been vouchsafed him, in causing him to be selected for\r\nso high and responsible a duty.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that he would rather have been sent to associate with\r\nthe barbarous people whom he expected to make his converts, than have\r\nbeen raised to the richest bishopric in England.  And yet, with this\r\nexultation, there was a spirit of deep melancholy pervading his\r\ncountenance, as well as his discourses, that seemed to imply a sense of\r\ndanger.  The nimbus of the saint in his eyes, was associated with the\r\ncrown of martyrdom.  He seemed to look forward to a fatal termination of\r\nhis ministry, as the most natural and proper conclusion of his labours.\r\n\r\n\"His conversation often filled me with dread.  His intimations of danger\r\nseemed at first very shocking, but, at last, I got more familiar with\r\nthese terrible suggestions, and regarded them as the distempered fancies\r\nof an over-worked mind.\r\n\r\n\"In this way our long voyage passed, and we arrived at last at our place\r\nof destination.  When we had disembarked, the scene that presented\r\nitself to me was so strange, that I could almost believe I had passed\r\ninto a new world.  The most luxurious vegetation, of a character I had\r\nnever seen before--the curious buildings--the singular forms of the\r\nnatives, and their peculiar costume--excited my wonder to an intense\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n\"My husband applied himself diligently to learn the language of the\r\npeople, whilst I as intently studied their habits and customs.  We both\r\nmade rapid progress.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I could make myself understood, I endeavoured to make\r\nfriends with the women, particularly with the wives of the great men,\r\nand although I was at first the object of more curiosity than regard, I\r\npersisted in my endeavours, and succeeded in establishing with many a\r\ngood understanding.\r\n\r\n\"I found them ignorant of everything that in civilised countries is\r\nconsidered knowledge--their minds being enveloped in the most deplorable\r\ndarkness--the only semblance of religion in use amongst them being a\r\nbrutal and absurd idolatry.\r\n\r\n\"I often tried to lead them to the consideration of more humanising\r\ntruths, for the purpose of preparing the way for the inculcation of the\r\ngreat mysteries of our holy religion; but the greater portion of my\r\nhearers were incompetent to understand what I seemed so desirous of\r\nteaching, and my making them comprehend the principles of Christianity,\r\nappeared to be a hopeless task.\r\n\r\n\"Yet I continued my pious labours, without allowing my exertions to\r\nflag--making myself useful to them and their families in every way I\r\ncould--attending them when sick--giving them presents when well--and\r\nshowing them every kindness likely to make a favourable impression on\r\ntheir savage natures.  In this way I proceeded doing good, till I found\r\nan opportunity of being of service to a young girl, about twelve years\r\nof age, who was a younger sister of one of the wives of a great chief.\r\nShe had sprained her ankle, and was in great pain, when I applied the\r\nproper remedies and gave her speedy relief.  Hooloo, for that was her\r\nname, from that moment became warmly attached to me; and finding her of\r\nan affectionate and ingenuous disposition, I became extremely desirous\r\nof improving upon the good impression I had made.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time my husband sought, by his knowledge of the mechanical\r\narts, and some acquaintance with medicine, to recommend himself to the\r\nmen.  He also met with much difficulty at first, in making his\r\ninformation properly appreciated.  He sought to increase their\r\ncomforts--to introduce agricultural implements of a more useful\r\ndescription, and to lead then generally towards the conveniences and\r\ndecencies of civilisation.  He built himself a house and planted a\r\ngarden, and cultivated some land, in which he showed the superior\r\nadvantages of what he knew, to what they practised.  They seemed to\r\nmarvel much, but continued to go on in their own way.\r\n\r\n\"He also went amongst them as a physician, and having acquired\r\nconsiderable knowledge of medicine and simple surgery, he was enabled to\r\nwork some cures in fevers and spear-wounds, that in course of time made\r\nfor him so great a reputation, that many of the leading chiefs sent for\r\nhim, when anything ailed then or their families, and they were so well\r\nsatisfied with what he did for them, that he began to be looked upon as\r\none who was to be treated with particular respect and honour by all\r\nclasses of the natives, from the highest to the lowest.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion the king required his services.  He was suffering from\r\na sort of colic, for which the native doctors could give him no relief.\r\nMy husband administered some medicines, and stayed with his majesty\r\nuntil they had the desired effect, and the result being a complete\r\nrecovery, seemed so astonishing to all the members of his Sandwich\r\nmajesty's court, that the doctor was required to administer the same\r\nmedicine to every one, from the queen to the humblest of her attendants,\r\nthough all were apparently in good health.  He managed to satisfy then\r\nwith a small portion only of the mixture, which he was quite certain\r\ncould do them no harm: and they professed to be wonderfully the better\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"His reputation had now grown so great, that whatever he required was\r\nreadily granted.  He first desired to have some children sent him, to\r\nlearn those things which had enabled him to do so much good, and this\r\nhaving been readily sanctioned, we opened a school for girls and boys,\r\nin which we taught the first elements of a civilised education.\r\n\r\n\"Finding we made fair progress in this way, we commenced developing our\r\nreal object,--the inculcation of Christian sentiments.  This meeting\r\nwith no opposition, and Reichardt having established a powerful\r\ninfluence over the entire community, he next proceeded with the parents,\r\nand earnestly strove to induce them to embrace the profession of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n\"His labours were not entirely unproductive.  There began to prevail\r\namongst the islanders, a disposition to hear the wondrous discourses of\r\nthis stranger, and he was employed, day after day, in explaining to\r\nlarge and attentive audiences, the history of the Christian world, and\r\nthe observances and doctrine of that faith which had been cemented by\r\nthe blood of the Redeemer.  The new and startling subjects of his\r\ndiscourse, as well as the impressive character of his eloquence,\r\nfrequently deeply moved his hearers; and at his revelations they would\r\noften burst forth into piercing shouts and loud expressions of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\"In truth it was a moving scene.  The noble figure of the missionary,\r\nwith his fine features lighted up with the fire of holy enthusiasm,\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of dusky savages, armed with spears and war-clubs,\r\nand partly clothed with feathers, in their features showing traces of\r\nunusual excitement, and every now and then joining in a wild chorus,\r\nexpressive of their wonder, could not have been witnessed by any\r\nChristian, without emotion.\r\n\r\n\"But when the ceremony of Baptism was first performed before them, their\r\namazement was increased a thousand-fold.  The first member of our flock\r\nwas Hooloo, whom I had instructed so far in the principles of our faith,\r\nand I had acquired such an influence over her mind, that she readily\r\nconsented to abandon her idolatrous customs and become a Christian.\r\n\r\n\"After a suitable address to the natives, who had assembled in some\r\nthousands to witness the spectacle, in which he explained to them the\r\nmotive and object of baptism, my husband assisted the girl down a\r\nsloping green bank which led to a beautiful stream, and walked with her\r\ninto the water till he was up to his waist, then, after offering up a\r\nlong and fervent prayer that this first victory over the false worship\r\nof the Devil might be the forerunner of the entire extirpation of\r\nidolatry from the land, he, plunging her into the water, baptised her in\r\nthe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n\"All the people were awed to silence while the ceremony proceeded; but\r\nwhen it was over, they burst forth into a loud cry, and came down to\r\nmeet the new Christian and my husband as they came out of the water, and\r\nwaved over them boughs of trees, and danced and shouted as though in an\r\necstasy.\r\n\r\n\"We however had not proceeded to this extent without exciting\r\nconsiderable opposition; our disrespect towards their idols had given\r\ngreat offence to those who were identified with the superstitions of the\r\npeople, and flourished according as these were supported.  Complaints\r\nwere made too of our teaching a new religion, in opposition to the gods\r\nthey and their fathers had worshipped, and a powerful party was got\r\ntogether for the purpose of pursuing us to destruction.\r\n\r\n\"My husband was summoned before a council of the great chiefs, to hear\r\nthe accusations that had been brought against him: and the old idolaters\r\ngot up and abused him, and threatened him with the punishment of their\r\nmonstrous gods, for telling lies to the people, and deceiving them with\r\nforged tales and strange customs.\r\n\r\n\"They sought all they could, to move the judges against him, by painting\r\nthe terrible fate that would befall them if they failed to kill the\r\nwhite stranger, who had insulted their gods; and they predicted hosts of\r\ncalamities that were to happen, in consequence of their having allowed\r\nthe teller of lies to work so much mischief against them.\r\n\r\n\"My husband then being called upon for his defence, first declared to\r\nthe judges the attributes of the Deity he worshipped: that He created\r\nthe vast heavens, the stars, the mountains, the rivers, and the sea; His\r\nvoice spoke in the thunder, and His eye flashed in the lightning.  He\r\nthen dwelt on His goodness to man, especially to the Sandwich Islanders,\r\nwhom He had created for the purpose of enjoying the fine country around\r\nthem and of beholding the beauty of the heavens where He dwelt.  Then he\r\nreferred to the gods they had worshipped, and asked how they were made,\r\nand what such senseless things could do for them; commenting on their\r\ninability to serve them in any way, or do them any harm; and went on to\r\nspeak of the benefits he had been able to confer upon them, through the\r\ninfluence of the all-powerful God he worshipped; and asked them if he\r\nhad ever done them anything but good.  Lastly, he promised them\r\ninnumerable benefits, if they would leave their useless gods, and turn\r\nto the only God who had the power to serve them.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for me to do justice to the animated manner in which\r\nhe delivered this discourse.  It produced great effect upon the majority\r\nof his hearers; but there was a powerful minority it still more strongly\r\ninfluenced against him; and they continued to interrupt him with\r\nterrible outcries.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the leading chiefs were against his suffering any harm.  They\r\nbore in mind the advantages he had conferred, by his skill in medicine,\r\nand superior wisdom in various other things, which the people would lose\r\nwere he put to death.  They also remembered the hope he held out of\r\nfuture benefits, which of course they could not expect, if they offered\r\nhim any violence.\r\n\r\n\"The result was, that my husband was suffered to go harmless from the\r\nmeeting, to the great disappointment of his enemies, who could scarcely\r\nbe kept from laying violent hands upon him.  The danger he had escaped,\r\nunfortunately, did not render him more prudent.  Far from it.  He\r\nbelieved that he was a chosen instrument of the Most High, to win these\r\nsavages from the depths of idolatry and paganism; and continued, on\r\nevery occasion that presented itself, to endeavour to win souls to God.\r\n\r\n\"The school increased, several of the parents suffered themselves to be\r\nbaptised, and there was a regular observance of the Lord's Day amongst\r\nthose who belonged to our little flock.  Even many of the islanders,\r\nalthough they did not become Christians, attended our religious\r\nservices, and spoke well of us.\r\n\r\n\"We brought up the young people to be able to teach their brethren and\r\nsisters; and hoped to be able to establish missions in other parts of\r\nthe island, to which we sometimes made excursions; preaching the\r\ninestimable blessings of the Gospel to the islanders, and exhorting them\r\nto abandon their dark customs and heathen follies.  I was not far behind\r\nmy husband in this good work, and acquired as much influence among the\r\nwomen, as he exercised over the men: indeed we were generally looked\r\nupon as holy people, who deserved to be treated with veneration and\r\nrespect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\n\"Things went on in this flourishing way for several years; my husband,\r\ndeeply impressed with the responsibility of his position, as a chosen\r\nservant of God, devoted himself so entirely to the great work he had\r\nundertaken, that he often seemed to overlook the claims upon his\r\nattention of her he had chosen as his partner in his struggle against\r\nthe powers of darkness.  Sometimes I did not see him for several days;\r\nand often when we were together he was so abstracted he did not seem\r\naware I was present.  Whenever I could get him to speak of himself, he\r\nwould dilate on the unspeakable felicity that he felt in drawing nearer\r\nto the end of his work.  I affected not to know to what he alluded; but\r\nI always felt that he was referring to the impression he entertained of\r\nhis own speedy dissolution, which he had taken up when he first embraced\r\nthis mission.\r\n\r\n\"I tried to get rid of my misgivings, by recalling the dangers and\r\ndifficulties we had triumphantly passed, and referring to the\r\nencouraging state of things that existed at the present time;\r\nnevertheless, I could not prevent a sinking of the heart whenever I\r\nheard him venture upon the subject; and when he was absent from me, I\r\noften experienced an agony of anxiety till his return.  I saw, however,\r\nno real cause of apprehension, and endeavoured to persuade myself none\r\nexisted; and very probably I should have succeeded, had not my husband\r\nso frequently indulged in references to our separation.\r\n\r\n\"Alas,\" she exclaimed, mournfully, \"he was better informed than I was of\r\nthe proximity of that Celestial Home, for which he had been so long and\r\nzealously preparing himself.  He, doubtless, had his intimation from on\r\nhigh, that his translation to the realms of bliss was no remote\r\nconsequence of his undertaking the mission he had accepted; and he had\r\nfamiliarised his mind to it as a daily duty, and by his constant\r\nreferences had sought to prepare me for the catastrophe he knew to be\r\ninevitable.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Reichardt became so sensibly affected, that it was some time\r\nbefore she could proceed with her narrative.  She, however, did so at\r\nlast; yet I could see by the tears that traced each other down her wan\r\ncheeks, how much her soul was moved by the terrible details into which\r\nshe was obliged to enter.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of our success,\" she presently resumed, \"when we had\r\nestablished a congregation, had baptised hundreds of men, women, and\r\nchildren; had completed a regular place of worship and an extensive\r\nschool-house, both of which were fully and regularly attended, some\r\nEuropean vessel paid us a short visit, soon after which, that dreadful\r\nscourge the small-pox broke out amongst the people.  Both children and\r\nadults were seized and as soon as one died, a dozen were attacked.\r\n\r\n\"Soon the greatest alarm pervaded the natives my husband was implored to\r\nstop the pestilence, which power they felt convinced he had in his\r\nhands.  He did all that was possible for him to do, but that\r\nunfortunately was very little.  His recommendation of remedial measures\r\nwas rarely attended with the desired results.  Death was very busy.  The\r\npeople died in scores, and the survivors, excited by the vindictive men\r\nwho had formerly sought his death for disparaging their gods began not\r\nonly to fall off rapidly in their regard and reverence for my husband;\r\nbut murmurs first, and execrations afterwards, and violent menaces\r\nsubsequently, attended him whenever he appeared.\r\n\r\n\"He preached to them resignation to the Divine will; but resignation was\r\nnot a savage virtue.  He was indefatigable in his attentions to the\r\nsick; but those of whom he was most careful seemed the speediest to die.\r\nThe popular feeling against him increased every hour; he appeared,\r\nhowever, to defy his fate--walking unconcernedly amongst crowds of\r\ninfuriated savages brandishing heavy clubs, and threatening him with the\r\npoints of their sharp spears; but his eye never blinked, and his cheek\r\nnever blanched, and he walked on his way inwardly praising God, careless\r\nof the evil passions that raged around him.\r\n\r\n\"It was on a Sabbath morn--our service had far advanced; we could boast\r\nof but a limited congregation, for many had died, some had fled from the\r\npestilence into the interior; others had avoided the place in\r\nconsequence of the threats of their countrymen.  A few children, and two\r\nor three women, were all their teacher had to address.\r\n\r\n\"We were engaged in singing a psalm, when a furious crowd, mad with\r\nrage, as it seemed, screaming and yelling in the most frightful manner,\r\nand brandishing their weapons as though about to attack an enemy, burst\r\ninto our little chapel, and seized my husband in the midst of his\r\ndevotions.\r\n\r\n\"I rushed forward to protect him from the numerous weapons that were\r\naimed at his life, but was dragged back by the hair of my head, and with\r\ninfuriate cries and gestures, that made them look like demons broke\r\nloose from hell, they fell upon him with their clubs and spears.\r\n\r\n\"Reichardt made no resistance, he merely clasped his hands the more\r\nfirmly, and looked up to heaven the more devoutly, as he continued the\r\nPsalm he had commenced before they entered.  This did not delay his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n\"They beat out his brains so close to me, that I was covered with his\r\nblood; and I believe I should have shared the same fate, had I not\r\nfainted with terror at the horrible scene of which I was a forced\r\nspectator.\r\n\r\n\"I learned afterwards that some powerful chief interfered, and I was\r\ncarried away more dead than alive; in which state I long remained.  As\r\nsoon as I became sufficiently strong to be moved, I took advantage of a\r\nwhaler calling at the island, homeward bound, to beg a passage.  The\r\ncaptain heard my lamentable story, took me on board as soon as he could,\r\nand showed a seaman's sympathy for my sufferings.\r\n\r\n\"I was to have returned to England with him, but off this place we\r\nencountered a terrible storm, in which we were obliged to take to the\r\nboats, as the only chance of saving our lives.  What became of him I\r\nknow not, as the two boats parted company soon after leaving the wreck.\r\nI trust he managed to reach the land in safety, and is now in his own\r\ncountry, enjoying all the comforts that can make life covetable.\r\n\r\n\"What became of that part of the crew that brought me here in the other\r\nboat, led by the fires you had lighted, I am in doubt.  But I think on\r\nquitting the island, crowded as their boat was, and in the state of its\r\ncrew, it was scarcely possible for them to have made the distant island\r\nfor which they steered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt's story made a sensible impression on me.  I no longer\r\nwondered at the pallor of her countenance, or the air of melancholy that\r\nat first seemed so remarkable; she had suffered most severely, and her\r\nsufferings were too recent not to have left their effects upon her\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nI thought a good deal about her narrative, and wondered much that men\r\ncould be got to leave their comfortable homes, and travel thousands and\r\nthousands of miles across the fathomless seas, with the hope of\r\nconverting a nation of treacherous savages, by whom they were sure to be\r\nslaughtered at the first outbreak of ill-feeling.\r\n\r\nI could not but admire the character of Reichardt--in all his actions he\r\nhad exhibited a marked nobility of nature.  He would not present himself\r\nbefore the woman who had the strongest claims upon his gratitude, till\r\nhe had obtained a position and a reputation that should, in his opinion,\r\nmake him worthy of her; and though he had a presentiment of the fate\r\nthat would overtake him, he fulfilled his duties as a missionary with a\r\nholy enthusiasm that made him regard his approaching martyrdom as the\r\ngreatest of all earthly distinctions.  I felt regret that I had not\r\nknown such a man.  I knew how much I had lost in having missed such an\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nMy having heard this story, led me into much private communing with\r\nmyself respecting religion.  I could consider myself little better than\r\na savage, like the brutal Sandwich Islanders; my conduct to Jackson had\r\nbeen only in a degree less inhuman than that these idolaters had shown\r\nto their teacher when he was in their power.  I fancied at the time that\r\nI served him right, for his villainous conduct to my father, and brutal\r\nconduct to me: but God having punished him for his misdeeds, I felt\r\nsatisfied I had no business to put him to greater torment as\r\nsatisfaction for my own private injuries.  I fancied God might have been\r\nangry with me, and had kept me on the island as a punishment for my\r\noffences; and I had some conversation with Mrs Reichardt on this point.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" she observed, \"can excuse your ill-feeling towards Jackson;\r\nhe was a bad man, without a doubt, and he deserved condign punishment\r\nfor his usage of your parents; but the Divine founder of our religion\r\nhas urged us to return good for evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered readily, \"but I should have suffered as bad as my\r\nfather and mother, had I not prevented his doing me mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know that you were to suffer,\" she replied.  \"Jackson,\r\nwithout such terrible punishment as he brought upon himself, might\r\neventually have become contrite, and have restored you to your friends\r\nas well as enabled you to obtain your grandfather's property.  God\r\nfrequently performs marvellous things with such humble instruments; for\r\nhe hath said, `there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that\r\nrepenteth, than over ninety-nine just men.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, this is raising the wicked man over the good,\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" she replied.  \"The repentant is one gained from the ranks\r\nof the great enemy--it is as one that was lost and is found again--it is\r\na soul added to the blessed.  Therefore the joy in heaven is abundant at\r\nsuch a conversion.  The just are the natural heirs of heaven--their\r\nrights are acknowledged without dispute--their claim is at once\r\nrecognised and allowed, and they receive their portion of eternal joy as\r\na matter of course, without there being any necessity for exciting those\r\ndemonstrations of satisfaction which hail the advent of a sinner saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think such a villain as Jackson would ever go to heaven,\" I\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"`Judge not, lest ye be judged,'\" she answered; \"that is a text that\r\ncannot be too often impressed upon persons anxious to condemn to eternal\r\ntorment all those they believe to be worse than themselves.  It is great\r\npresumption in us poor creatures of clay, to anticipate the proceedings\r\nof the Infinite Wisdom.  Let us leave the high prerogative of judgment\r\nto the Almighty Power, by whom only it is exercised, and in our opinions\r\nof even the worst of our fellow-creatures, let us exercise a\r\ncomprehensive charity, mingled with a prayer that even at the eleventh\r\nhour, they may have turned from the evil of their ways, and embraced the\r\nprospect of salvation, which the mercy of their Creator has held out to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nIn this and similar conversations, Mrs Reichardt would endeavour to\r\nplant in my mind the soundest views of religion; and she spoke so well,\r\nand so convincingly, that I had little trouble in understanding her\r\nmeaning, or in retaining it after it had been uttered.\r\n\r\nIt was not, as I have before stated, to religion only that she led my\r\nthoughts, although that certainly was the most frequent subject of our\r\nconversation.  She sought to instruct me in the various branches of\r\nknowledge into which she had acquired some insight, and in this way I\r\npicked up as much information respecting grammar, geography, astronomy,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, history, and morals, as I should have gained had I\r\nbeen at a school, instead of being forced to remain on a desolate\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I still desired to leave it.  I had long been tired\r\nof the place, notwithstanding that, from our united exertions, we\r\nenjoyed many comforts which we could not have hoped for.  Our hut we had\r\nmetamorphosed into something Mrs Reichardt styled a rustic cottage,\r\nwhich, covered as it was with flowers and creepers, really looked very\r\npretty; and the garden added greatly to its pleasant appearance: for\r\nnear the house we had transplanted everything that bore a flower that\r\ncould be found in the island, and had planted some shrubs, that, having\r\nbeen carefully nurtured, made rapid growth, and screened the hut from\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nI had built a sort of outhouse for storing potatoes and firewood, and a\r\nfowl-house for the gannets, which were now a numerous flock; and had\r\nplanted a fence round the garden, so that, as Mrs Reichardt said, we\r\nlooked as if we had selected a dwelling in our own beloved England, in\r\nthe heart of a rural district, instead of our being circumscribed in a\r\nlittle island thousands of miles across the wide seas, from the home of\r\nwhich we were so fond of talking.\r\n\r\nAlthough my companion always spoke warmly of the land of her birth, and\r\nevidently would have been glad to return to it, she never grieved over\r\nher hard fate in being, as it were, a prisoner on a rock, out of reach\r\nof friends and kindred; indeed, she used to chide me for being impatient\r\nof my detention, and insensible of the blessings I enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"What temptations are we not free from here?\" she would say.  \"We see\r\nnothing of the world; we cannot be contaminated with its vices, or\r\nsuffer from its follies.  The hideous wars--the terrible revolutions--\r\nthe dreadful visitations of famine and pestilence--are completely\r\nunknown to us.  Robbery, and murder, and fraud, and the thousand other\r\nphases of human wickedness, we altogether escape.  There was a time,\r\nwhen men, for the purpose of leading holy lives, abandoned the fair\r\ncities in which they had lived in the enjoyment of every luxury, and\r\nsought a cave in some distant desert, where, in the lair of some wild\r\nbeast, with a stone for a pillow, a handful of herbs for a meal, and a\r\ncup of water for beverage, they lived out the remnant of their days in a\r\nconstant succession of mortifications, prayers, and penitence.\r\n\r\n\"How different,\" she added, \"is our own state.  We are as far removed\r\nfrom the sinfulness of the world, as any hermit of the desert, whilst we\r\nhave the enjoyment of comforts to which they were strangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But probably,\" I observed, \"these men were penitents, and went into the\r\ndesert as much to punish their bodies for the transgressions of the\r\nflesh, as to acquire by solitary communion, a better knowledge of the\r\nspirit than they were likely to obtain in their old haunts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some were penitents, no doubt,\" she answered, \"but they, having\r\nobtained by their sanctity an extraordinary reputation, induced others,\r\nwhose lives had been blameless, to follow their example, and in time the\r\ndesert became colonised with recluses, who rivalled each other in the\r\nintensity of their devotions and the extent of their privations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not have been more commendable,\" I asked, \"if these men had\r\nremained in the community to which they belonged, withstanding\r\ntemptation, and employed in labour that was creditable to themselves,\r\nand useful to their country?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it would,\"--she replied; \"but religion has unfortunately, too\r\noften been the result of impulse rather than conviction; and at the\r\nperiod to which we are referring, it was thought that sinful human\r\nnature could only gain the attributes of saintship by neglecting its\r\nsocial duties, and punishing its humanity in the severest manner.  Even\r\nin more recent times, and at the present day, in Catholic countries, it\r\nis customary for individuals of both sexes, to abandon the world of\r\nwhich they might render themselves ornaments, and shut themselves up in\r\nbuildings constructed expressly to receive them, where they continue to\r\ngo through a course of devotions and privations till death puts an end\r\nto their voluntary imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"In this modified instance of seclusion,\" she added, \"there are features\r\nvery different from our own case.  We are not forced to impoverish our\r\nblood with insufficient diet, or mortify our flesh with various forms of\r\npunishment.  We do not neglect the worship of God.  We offer up daily\r\nthanks for His loving care of us, and sing His praises in continual\r\nhymns; and instead of wasting the hours of the day in unmeaning\r\npenances, we fill up our time in employments that add to our health,\r\ncomfort, and happiness; and that enable us the better to appreciate the\r\ngoodness of that Power who is so mindful of our welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no wish, then, to leave this island?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I should gladly avail myself of the first opportunity that presented\r\nitself, for getting safely to England,\" she replied.  \"But I would wait\r\npatiently the proper time.  It is not only useless repining at our\r\nprolonged stay here, but it looks like an ungrateful doubting of the\r\npower of God to remove us.  Be assured that He has not preserved us so\r\nlong, and through so many dangers, to abandon us when we most require\r\nHis interposition in our favour.\"\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to gather consolation from such representations: but\r\nperhaps young people are not so easily reconciled to what they do not\r\nlike, as are their elders; for I cannot say I succeeded in becoming\r\nsatisfied with my position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nThe perils of my first voyage had deterred me from making a similar\r\nexperiment; but I recovered my boat, and having further strengthened it,\r\nfitted it with what could either be turned into a well or locker: I used\r\nto row out a little distance when the sea was free from sharks and fish.\r\n\r\nBut my grand effort in this direction, was the completion of a net,\r\nwhich, assisted by Mrs Reichardt, I managed to manufacture.  By this\r\ntime, she had gained sufficient confidence to accompany me in my fishing\r\nexcursions; she would even take the oars whilst I threw out the net, and\r\nassisted me in dragging it into the boat.\r\n\r\nThe first time we got such a haul, that I was afraid of the safety of\r\nour little craft.  The locker was full, and numbers of great fish, as I\r\nflung them out of the net, were flapping and leaping about the bottom of\r\nthe boat.  It began to sink lower in the water than was agreeable to\r\neither of us, and I found it absolutely necessary to throw back into the\r\nsea the greater portion of our catch.  We then rowed carefully to land,\r\nrejoicing that we had at our command the means of obtaining an abundant\r\nsupply of food whenever we desired it.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt was with me also in our land excursions.  Together we had\r\nexplored every part of the island; our chief object was plants for\r\nenriching our garden; and, often as we had been in search of novelties,\r\nwe invariably brought home additions to our collection; and my companion\r\nhaving acquired some knowledge of botany, would explain to me the names,\r\ncharacters, and qualities of the different species; which made our\r\njourneys peculiarly interesting.\r\n\r\nOur appearance often caused considerable amusement to each other; for\r\nour respective costumes must have been extremely curious in the eyes of\r\na stranger.  Neither wore shoes or stockings--these things we did not\r\npossess, and could not procure; we wore leggings and sandals of\r\nseal-skin to protect us from the thorns and plants of the cacti tribe,\r\namong which we were obliged to force our way.  My companion wore a\r\nconical cap of seal-skin, and protected her complexion from the sun by a\r\nrude attempt at an umbrella I had made for her.\r\n\r\nShe had on, on these occasions, a pair of coarse cloth trousers, as her\r\nown dress would have been torn to pieces before she had got half a mile\r\nthrough the bush; these were surmounted by a tight spencer she had\r\nherself manufactured out of a man's waistcoat, and a dimity petticoat,\r\nwhich buttoned up to her throat, and was fastened in the same way at the\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\nMy head was covered with a broad-brimmed hat, made of dry grass, which I\r\nhad myself plaited.  I wore a sailor's jacket, much the worse for wear,\r\npatched with seal-skin, over a pair of duck trousers, similarly\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nAlthough our expeditions were perfectly harmless, we did not go without\r\nweapons.  At the instigation of my companion, I had made myself a good\r\nstout bow and plenty of arrows, and had exercised myself so frequently\r\nat aiming at a mark, as to have acquired very considerable skill in the\r\nuse of them.  I had now several arrows of hard wood tipped with sharp\r\nfish-bones, and some with iron nails, in a kind of pouch behind me; in\r\nits sheath before me was my American knife, which I used for taking the\r\nplants from the ground.  I had a basket made of the long grass of the\r\nisland, slung around me, which served to contain our treasures; and I\r\ncarried my bow in my hand.\r\n\r\nMy companion, in addition to her umbrella, bore only a long staff, and a\r\nsmall basket tied round her waist, that usually contained a little\r\nrefreshment; for she would say there was no knowing what might occur to\r\ndelay our return, and therefore it was better to take our meal with us.\r\nAnd not the least agreeable portion of the day's labour was our repast;\r\nfor we would seat ourselves in some quiet corner, surrounded by flowers,\r\nand shaded by the brushwood from the sun, and there eat our dried fish\r\nor pick our birds, and roast our potatoes by means of a fire of dried\r\nsticks, and wash down our simple dinner with a flask of pure water--the\r\nmost refreshing portion of our banquet.\r\n\r\nI had, as I have just stated, attained a singular degree of skill in the\r\nuse of the bow and arrow, which, as we had no firearms, was often of\r\nimportant service in procuring food on land.\r\n\r\nI had made another use of my skill--an application of it which afforded\r\nme a vast deal of satisfaction.  My old enemies the sharks used still to\r\nfrequent a certain portion of the coast, in great numbers, and as soon\r\nas I became master of my weapon, I would stand as near to the edge of\r\nthe rock as was safe, and singling out my victim, aim at his upper fin,\r\nwhich I often found had the effect of ridding the place of that fellow.\r\n\r\nI bore such an intense hatred to these creatures for the fright they had\r\nput me into during my memorable voyage of discovery, and for the\r\nslaughter of my beloved Nero, that I determined to wage incessant war\r\nagainst them, as long as I could manufacture an arrow, or a single shark\r\nremained on the coast.\r\n\r\nAs we had so often traversed the island without accident, we dreamt not\r\nof danger.  We had never met with any kind of animals, except our old\r\nfriends the seals, who kept near the sea.  Of birds, the gannets were\r\ngenerally the sole frequenters of the island; but we had seen, at rare\r\nintervals, birds of a totally different character, some of which I had\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nIndeed, during our excursions, I was always on the look-out for any\r\nstranger of the feathered race, that I might exercise my skill upon him.\r\nIf he proved eatable, he was sure to be very welcome; and even if he\r\ncould not be cooked, he afforded me some entertainment, in hearing from\r\nMrs Reichardt his name and habits.\r\n\r\nWe had discovered a natural hollow which lay so low that it was quite\r\nhid till we came close to it, when we had to descend a steep declivity\r\ncovered with shrubs.  At the bottom was a soil evidently very\r\nproductive, for we found trees growing there to a considerable height,\r\nthat were in marked contrast to the shrubby plants that grew in other\r\nparts of the island.  We called this spot the Happy Valley, and it\r\nbecame a favourite resting-place.\r\n\r\nI remember on one of these occasions, we had made our dinner after\r\nhaving been several hours employed in seeking for plants, of which we\r\nhad procured a good supply, and the remains of our meal lay under a\r\ngreat tree, beneath the spreading branches of which we had been resting\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIt was quite on the other side of the island, within about a quarter of\r\na mile of the sea.  Abundance of curious plants grew about the place,\r\nand Mrs Reichardt had wandered to a little distance to examine all\r\nwithin view.\r\n\r\nI was peering into the trees and shrubs around to discover a newcomer.\r\nI had wandered in an opposite direction to that taken by my companion,\r\nand was creeping round a clump of shrubs about twenty yards off, in\r\nwhich I detected a chirping noise, when I heard a loud scream.\r\n\r\nI turned sharply round and beheld Mrs Reichardt, evidently in an agony\r\nof terror, running towards me with prodigious swiftness.  She had\r\ndropped her umbrella and her staff, her cap had fallen from her head,\r\nand her long hair, disarranged by her sudden flight, streamed behind her\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nAt first I did not see anything which could have caused this terrible\r\nalarm; but in a few seconds I heard a crushing among a thicket of shrubs\r\nfrom which she was running, as if some heavy weight was being forced\r\nthrough them; and presently there issued a most extraordinary monster.\r\nIt came forward at a quick pace, its head erect above ten feet, its jaws\r\nwide open, from the midst of which there issued a forked tongue which\r\ndarted in and out with inconceivable rapidity.  Its body was very long,\r\nand thick as an ordinary tree; it was covered over with bright shining\r\nscales that seemed to have different colours, and was propelled along\r\nthe ground in folds of various sizes, with a length of tail of several\r\nyards behind.  Its eyes were very bright and fierce.  Its appearance\r\ncertainly accounted for my companion's alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Fly!\" she cried in accents of intense terror, as she rushed towards me,\r\n\"fly, or you are lost!\"\r\n\r\nShe then gave a hurried glance behind her, and seeing the formidable\r\nmonster in full chase, she just had power to reach the spot to which I\r\nhad advanced, and sunk, overpowered with terror, fainting at my feet.\r\n\r\nMy first movement was to step across her body for the purpose of\r\ndisputing the passage of the monster; and in an erect posture, with my\r\nbow drawn tight as I could pull it, I waited a few seconds till I could\r\nsecure a good aim, for I knew everything depended on my steadiness and\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nOn came my prodigious antagonist, making a terrible hissing as he\r\napproached, his eyes flashing, his jaws expanded as if he intended to\r\nswallow me at a mouthful, and the enormous folds of his huge body\r\npassing like wheels over the ground,--crushing the thick plants that\r\ncame in their way like grass.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge that in my heart I felt a strange sinking sensation,\r\nbut I remembered that our only chance of escape lay in giving the\r\nmonster a mortal wound, and the imminence of the danger seemed to afford\r\nme the resolution I required.\r\n\r\nHe was close behind, and in a direct line with the tree under which we\r\nhad dined, and I was about twenty yards from it.  Directly his head\r\ndarted round and in front of the tree, making a good mark, I let fly the\r\narrow direct, as I thought, for his eye, hoping, by penetrating his\r\nbrain, to settle him at once.  But as he moved his head at that moment,\r\nthe arrow went into his open jaws, one of which it penetrated, and going\r\ndeep into the tree behind, pinned his head close to the bark.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the huge creature found himself hurt, he wound his enormous\r\nbody round the trunk, and with his desperate exertions, swayed the great\r\ntree backwards and forwards, as I would have done one of its smallest\r\nbranches.  Fearful that he would liberate himself before I could save my\r\nsenseless companion, as quick as possible I discharged all my arrows\r\ninto his body, which took effect in various places.  His exertions then\r\nbecame so terrible, that I hastily snatched up Mrs Reichardt in my\r\narms, and with a fright that seemed to give me supernatural strength, I\r\nran as fast as I could the shortest way to our hut.  Fortunately, before\r\nI had gone half a mile, my companion came to her senses, and was able to\r\ncontinue her flight.\r\n\r\nWe got home at last, half dead with fatigue and fright; nevertheless the\r\nfirst thing we did was to barricade all the entrances.  We left\r\nloop-holes to reconnoitre; and there we sat for hours after our arrival,\r\nwaiting the monster's approach in fear and trembling.\r\n\r\nWe did not go to sleep that night.  We did not, either of us, go out the\r\nnext day.  The next night one watched while the other slept.  The second\r\nday my courage had so far returned, I wanted to go and look after the\r\nconstant subject of our conversation.  But Mrs Reichardt dissuaded me.\r\n\r\nShe told me it was an enormous python, or serpent of the boa species,\r\nthat are common in the northern coast of America.  Probably it had been\r\nbrought to the island on a drifted tree, and being so prodigious a\r\nreptile, the wounds it had received were not likely to do it much harm,\r\nand it would be no doubt lurking about, ready to pounce upon either of\r\nus directly we appeared.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, nothing having occurred to increase our alarm, I\r\ndetermined to know the worst; so I got by stealth out of the house, and,\r\narmed with a fresh bow, a good supply of arrows, a hatchet slung at my\r\nside, and my American knife--with my mind made up for another conflict\r\nif necessary--I crept stealthily along, with my eyes awake to the\r\nslightest motion, and my ears open to the slightest sound, till I\r\napproached the scene of my late unequal struggle.\r\n\r\nI must own I began to draw my breath rather rapidly, and my heart beat\r\nmore quickly, as I came near the place where I had left my terrible\r\nenemy.  To my extreme surprise the python had disappeared.  There was\r\nthe tree still standing, though its foliage and branches strewed the\r\nground, and a great portion of its bark was ground to powder.  At the\r\nbase of the trunk was a pool of blood, mingled with fragments of bark,\r\nbroken arrows, leaves, and mould.  The reptile had escaped.  But where\r\nwas he?  Not altogether without anxiety I began to look for traces of\r\nhis retreat; and they were easily found.  With my arrow ready for\r\nimmediate flight, I followed a stream of blood that was still visible on\r\nthe grass, and led from the tree, accompanied by unmistakeable marks of\r\nthe great serpent's progress, in a direct line to the sea.  There it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen I discovered this, I breathed again.  There was no doubt if the\r\nmonster survived the conflict, he was hundreds of miles away, and was\r\nnot likely to return to a place where he had received so rough a\r\nwelcome.  It may readily be believed I lost no time in taking the\r\nagreeable news to my companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nI had become tired of looking out for a ship.  Though day after day, and\r\nweek after week, I made the most careful scrutiny with my glass, as I\r\nhave said, it brought no result.  I sometimes fancied I saw a vessel\r\nappearing in the line of the horizon, and I would pile up fagots and\r\nlight them, and throw on water to make them smoke, as Jackson had done;\r\nbut all without avail.  Either my vision had deceived me, or my signals\r\nhad not been observed, or the ship's course did not lay in the direction\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nWe had had storms, too, on several occasions, but no wreck had been left\r\non our coast.  I began to think we were doomed to live out our lives on\r\nthis rock, and frequently found myself striving very manfully to be\r\nresigned to my fate, and for a few days I would cheerfully endeavour to\r\nmake the best of it.  But the increasing desire I felt to get to\r\nEngland, that I might seek out my grandfather, and put him in possession\r\nof his diamonds, always prevented this state of things enduring very\r\nlong.  I had obtained from Mrs Reichardt an idea of the value of these\r\nstones, and of the importance of their restoration to my relative, and I\r\nhad often thought of the satisfaction I should enjoy in presenting\r\nmyself before him, as the restorer of such valuable property, which, no\r\ndoubt, had long since been given up as lost.\r\n\r\nBut latterly, I thought less of these things; the chance of leaving the\r\nisland seemed so remote, and the prospect of ever seeing my grandfather\r\nso very distant, that I had ceased to take any interest in the contents\r\nof the belt.  The diamonds seemed to become as valueless as they were\r\nuseless; a handful of wheat would have been much more desirable.  It was\r\nnow some time since I had seen the belt, or inquired about it.\r\n\r\nThus we lived without any incident occurring worth relating--when one\r\nday the appearance of the atmosphere indicated a storm, and a very\r\nviolent hurricane, attended with peals of thunder and lurid flashes of\r\nlightning, lasted during the whole of the day and evening.  The wind\r\ntore up the trees by the roots, blew down our outhouses, made terrible\r\nhavoc in our garden, and threatened to tumble our hut over our heads.\r\n\r\nWe could not think of going to our beds whilst such a tempest was raging\r\naround us, so we sat up, listening to the creaking of the boards, and\r\nanticipating every moment that the whole fabric would be blown to\r\npieces.  Fortunately, the bark with which I had covered the roof, in a\r\ngreat measure protected us from the rain, which came down in torrents;\r\nbut every part was not equally impervious, and our discomfort was\r\nincreased by seeing the water drip through, and form pools on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe thunder still continued at intervals, and was sometimes so loud as\r\nto have a most startling effect upon us.  My companion knelt down and\r\nsaid her prayers with great fervour, and I joined in them with scarcely\r\nless devotion.  Indeed it was an awful night, and our position, though\r\nunder shelter, was not without danger.  The incessant flashes of\r\nlightning seemed to play round our edifice, as if determined to set it\r\nin a blaze; and the dreadful peals of thunder that followed, rolled over\r\nour heads, as if about to burst upon the creaking boards that shut us\r\nfrom its fury.\r\n\r\nI fancied once or twice that I heard during the storm, bursts of sound\r\nquite different in character from the peals of thunder.  They were not\r\nso loud, and did not reverberate so much; they seemed to come nearer,\r\nand then the difference in sound became very perceptible.\r\n\r\n\"Great God!\" exclaimed Mrs Reichardt, starting up from her kneeling\r\nposture, \"that is a gun from some ship.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind seemed less boisterous for a few seconds, and the thunder\r\nceased.  We listened breathlessly for the loud boom we had just heard,\r\nbut it was not repeated.  In a moment afterwards our ears were startled\r\nby the most terrifying combination of screams, shrieks, cries, and\r\nwailings, I had ever heard.  My blood seemed chilled in my veins.\r\n\r\n\"A ship has just struck,\" whispered my companion, scarcely above her\r\nbreath.  \"The Lord have mercy on the crew!\"\r\n\r\nShe sunk on her knees again in prayer, as if for the poor souls who were\r\nstruggling in the jaws of death.  The wind still howled, and the thunder\r\nstill roared; but in the fiercest war of the elements, I fancied I could\r\nevery now and then hear the piercing shrieks sent up to heaven for\r\nassistance.  I thought once or twice of venturing out, but I remembered\r\nthe safety of my companion was so completely bound up with my own, that\r\nI could not reconcile myself to leaving her; and I was also well aware,\r\nthat till the terrible fury of the tempest abated, it was impossible for\r\nme to be of the slightest service to the people of the wrecked ship,\r\neven could I remain unharmed exposed to the violence of the weather.\r\n\r\nI, however, awaited with much impatience and intense anxiety till the\r\nstorm had in some measure spent itself; but this did not occur till\r\nsunrise the next morning.  The wind fell, the thunder and lightning\r\nceased, the rain was evidently diminishing, and the brightness of the\r\ncoming day began to burst through the darkest night that had ever\r\nvisited the island.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt would not be left behind; it was possible she might be\r\nuseful, and taking with her a small basket of such things as she\r\nimagined might be required, she accompanied me to the rocks nearest the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nOn arriving there, the most extraordinary scene presented itself.  The\r\nsea was strewed with spars, masts, chests, boats stove in or otherwise\r\ninjured, casks, empty hencoops, and innumerable pieces of floating\r\nwreck, that were continually dashed against the rocks, or were washed\r\nashore, wherever an opening for the sea presented itself.  At a little\r\ndistance lay the remains of a fine ship, her masts gone by the board,\r\nher decks open, in fact a complete wreck, over which the sea had but\r\nlately been making a clean sweep, carrying overboard everything that\r\ncould not resist its fury.\r\n\r\nI could see nothing resembling a human being, though both myself and my\r\ncompanion looked carefully round, in the hope of discovering some poor\r\ncreature that might need assistance.  It appeared, however, as if the\r\npeople of the ship had taken to their boats, which had been swamped, and\r\nmost probably all who had ventured into them had been devoured by the\r\nsharks.\r\n\r\nHad the crew remained on board, they would in all probability have been\r\nsaved; as the vessel had been thrown almost high and dry.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had satisfied ourselves that no sharks were in the\r\nneighbourhood, I launched my little boat, and each taking an oar, we\r\npulled in the direction of the wreck, which we reached in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nShe had heeled over after striking, and the water was quite smooth under\r\nher lee.  I contrived to climb into the main chains, and from thence on\r\nboard, and was soon afterwards diligently exploring the ship.  I\r\npenetrated every place into which I could effect an entrance, marvelling\r\nmuch at the variety of things.  I beheld.  There seemed such an\r\nabundance of everything, and of things, too, quite new to me, that I was\r\nbewildered by their novelty and variety.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered a coil of new rope, I hauled it on deck, and soon made\r\nfast my little boat to the ship.  Then I made a hasty rope ladder, which\r\nI threw over, and Mrs Reichardt was in a very few minutes standing by\r\nmy side.  Her knowledge was necessary to inform me of the uses of the\r\nseveral strange things I saw, and to select for our own use what was\r\nmost desirable.  She being well acquainted with the interior of a ship,\r\nand having explained to me its numerous conveniences, I could not but\r\nadmire the ingenuity of man, in creating such stupendous machines.\r\n\r\nThe ship having much water in the hold, I was forced to dive into the\r\narmoury.  It was the first time I had seen such things, and I handled\r\nthe muskets and pistols with a vast deal of curiosity; as my companion\r\nexplained to me how they were loaded and fired, I at once saw their\r\nadvantage over the bow and arrow, and was selecting two or three to\r\ncarry away, when I hesitated on being assured they would be perfectly\r\nuseless without ammunition.  I might have remained content with my own\r\nsavage weapons, that had already served me so well, had not Mrs\r\nReichardt, in the course of our survey, discovered several tin canisters\r\nof powder perfectly uninjured, with abundance of shot and bullets, of\r\nwhich I quickly took possession.\r\n\r\nFrom other parts of the vessel we selected bags of grain, barrels of\r\nflour, and provisions of various kinds; wearing apparel, boxes of tools,\r\nwith numerous bottles and jars, of the contents of which I was perfectly\r\nunacquainted, though their discovery gave great gratification to my\r\ncompanion.  What most excited my wonder, were various kinds of\r\nagricultural implements that we found in the hold, and in a short time I\r\nwas made aware of the proper employment of spades, harrows, ploughs,\r\nthrashing-machines, and many other things, of the existence of which I\r\nhad never before dreamt.\r\n\r\nWe found also quantities of various kinds of seeds and roots, and some\r\nsort of twigs growing in pots, which Mrs Reichardt particularly begged\r\nme not to leave behind, as they would be of the greatest use to us; and,\r\nshe added, that from various signs, she believed that the ship had been\r\nan emigrant vessel going out with settlers, but to what place she could\r\nnot say.\r\n\r\nWe made no ceremony in breaking open lockers and chests, and everywhere\r\ndiscovered a variety of things, which, could we transfer to our island,\r\nwould add greatly to our comfort; but how they were to be got ashore,\r\nwas a puzzle which neither of us seemed capable of solving.  Our little\r\nboat would only contain a few of the lighter articles; and as many of\r\nthese as we could conveniently put together were shortly stowed in her.\r\n\r\nWith this cargo we were about returning, when my companion called my\r\nattention to a noise that seemed to come from a distant corner of the\r\nvessel, and she laughed and exhibited so much satisfaction, that I\r\nbelieved we were close upon some discovery far more important than any\r\nwe had yet hit upon.\r\n\r\nWe continued to make our way to what seemed to me a very out of the way\r\npart of the vessel, led in a great measure by the noises that proceeded\r\nfrom thence.  It was so dark here, that we were obliged to get a light,\r\nand my companion having procured a ship's lantern, and lighted it by\r\nmeans of a tinder-box, led me to a place where I could discern several\r\nanimals, most of which were evidently dead.  She, however, ascertained\r\nthat there were two young calves, three or four sheep, and as many young\r\npigs, still giving very noisy evidence of their existence.  She searched\r\nabout and found some food for them, which they ate with great avidity.\r\nThe larger animals she told me were cows and horses; but they had fallen\r\ndown, and gave no signs of life.\r\n\r\nMy companion and myself then entered into a long debate as to how we\r\nwere to remove the living animals from the dead; and she dwelt very\r\neloquently upon the great advantages that would accrue to us, if we\r\ncould succeed in transporting to the island the survivors.\r\n\r\nAfter giving them a good feed, seeing we could not remove them at\r\npresent, we descended safely to our boat and gained the shore without\r\nany accident.  Then having housed our treasures, we were for putting\r\ntogether a raft of the various planks and barrels that were knocking\r\nagainst the rocks; but as I knew this would take a good deal of time, I\r\nthought I would inspect the ship's boats, which, bottom upwards, were\r\ndrifting about within a few yards of us.\r\n\r\nTo our great satisfaction, one I ascertained to be but little injured,\r\nand having forced her ashore, with our united exertions we turned her\r\nover.  In an hour we had made her water-tight, had picked up her oars,\r\nand were pulling merrily for the wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nHad the cows or horses been alive, they must have been left behind, for\r\nwe could not have removed them; but the smaller animals were with\r\ncomparatively little difficulty got on deck, and they descended with me\r\ninto the boat.  We added a few things that lay handy, and in a few\r\nminutes were laughingly driving our four-footed treasures on shore, to\r\nthe extreme astonishment of the gannets, which seemed as though they\r\nwould never cease to flap their wings, as their new associates were\r\ndriven by them.\r\n\r\nIn the same way we removed the most portable of the agricultural\r\nimplements, bed and bedding, cots and hammocks, furniture, the framework\r\nof a house, preserved provisions of all kinds, a medicine-chest, boxes\r\nof books, crates of china and glass, all sorts of useful tools, and\r\ndomestic utensils; in short, in the course of the next two or three\r\nweeks, by repeated journeys, we filled every available place we could\r\nfind with what we had managed to rescue.\r\n\r\nThen came another terrible storm that lasted two days, after which the\r\nwreck having been broken up, was scattered in every direction.  I\r\nhowever managed to secure the driftwood, tubs, spars, and chests, which\r\nwere all got on shore, and proved of the greatest service to me some\r\ntime afterwards.\r\n\r\nNumerous as our acquisitions had been in this way, both of us had been\r\ninfinitely better pleased had we been able to rescue some of the\r\nill-fated crew, to whom they had once belonged.  But not one of them\r\ncould have escaped, and only one body was cast on shore, which was that\r\nof a young woman, who lay with her face to the ground, and her wet\r\nclothes clinging round her.  We turned her carefully over, and I beheld\r\na face that seemed to me wonderfully fair and beautiful.  She had\r\nescaped the sharks, and had been dead several hours--most probably she\r\nhad been cast on shore by the waves, soon after the ship struck, for she\r\nhad escaped also the rocks, which, had she been dashed against, would\r\nhave left fearful signs of their contact on her delicate frame.\r\n\r\nThe sight of her corpse gave me many melancholy thoughts.  I thought of\r\nthe delight she might have caused both of us, had she been saved.  What\r\na pleasant companion she might have proved.  Indeed, as I looked on her\r\npale cold features, I fancied that she might have reconciled me to\r\nending my existence on the island--ay, even to the abandonment of my\r\nfavourite scheme of seeking my grandfather to give him back his\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nWe took her up with as much pity and affection as if she were our\r\nnearest and dearest relative, and carried her home, and placed her on\r\nMrs Reichardt's bed; and then I laid some planks together, in the shape\r\nof what Mrs Reichardt called a coffin--and I dug her a deep grave in\r\nthe guano.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while I found myself crying as I had never cried before, and\r\nmy heart seemed weary and faint.  In solemn silence we carried her to\r\nher grave, and read over her the funeral service out of the Prayer-book,\r\nkneeling and praying for this nameless creature, whom we had never seen\r\nalive, as though she had been our companion for many years; both of us\r\nshedding tears, for her hapless fate, as if we had lost a beloved\r\nsister.  And when we had filled up her grave and departed, we went home,\r\nand passed the most miserable day we had ever had to endure since we had\r\nfirst been cast upon the island.\r\n\r\nI had now numerous occupations that kept me actively employed.  Still I\r\ncould not for a long time help recalling to mind that pale face that\r\nlooked so piteously upon me when I first beheld it; and then I would\r\nleave off my work, and give myself up to my melancholy thoughts till my\r\nattention was called off by some appeal from my companion.  I made a\r\nkind of monument over the place where she was buried, and planted there\r\nthe finest flowers we had; and I never passed the spot without a prayer,\r\nas if I were approaching holy ground.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to add, that a few days after the wreck, we were\r\nagreeably surprised by visitors that, though unexpected, were extremely\r\nwelcome.  I had noticed strange birds wandering about in various parts\r\nof the island.  On their coming under the notice of my companion, they\r\nwere immediately recognised as fowls and ducks, that had no doubt\r\nescaped from the ship.\r\n\r\nWe might now, therefore, constitute ourselves a little colony, of which\r\nMrs Reichardt and myself were the immediate governors, the settlers\r\nbeing a mingled community of calves, sheep, pigs, and poultry, that\r\nlived on excellent terms with each other; the quadrupeds having\r\npermission to roam where they pleased, and the bipeds being kept within\r\na certain distance of the government house.\r\n\r\nThe old hut had suffered so much from the storm that I determined on\r\nbuilding another in a better position, and had recourse to the framework\r\nof the house I had taken from the wreck.  I had some difficulty in\r\nputting the several parts together, but at last succeeded, and a small,\r\nbut most commodious dwelling was the result.  Near it I laid out a new\r\ngarden, wherein I planted all the orange-trees we had reared, as well as\r\nmany of the seeds and roots we had brought from the wreck.  A little\r\nbeyond I inclosed a paddock, wherein I planted the twigs we had found in\r\npots, which proved to be fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done this, I thought of my agricultural implements, and very\r\nmuch desired to make use of a handy plough that was amongst them, when I\r\nlearned the advantages that might arise from it.  At first I yoked\r\nmyself to the plough, and Mrs Reichardt held it: this proved such hard\r\nand awkward work, that I kept projecting all sorts of plans for\r\nlessening the labour--the best was that of yoking our calves, and making\r\nthem pull instead of myself.  This was more easily thought of than done.\r\nThe animals did not prove very apt pupils, but in course of time, with\r\na good deal of patience, and some manoeuvring, I succeeded in making\r\nthem perform the work they were expected to do.\r\n\r\nThus, in building, gardening, planting, and farming, the time flew by\r\nquickly, and in the course of the next year the aspect of the place had\r\nbecome quite changed.  The guano that enriched the soil made every kind\r\nof vegetation thrive with an almost marvellous rapidity and luxuriance.\r\nWe had a comfortable house, up which a vine was creeping in one place,\r\nand a young pear-tree in another.  We were supplied with the choicest\r\noranges, and had apples of several kinds.  We had abundance of\r\nfurniture, and an inexhaustible stock of provisions.  We had a most\r\ngorgeous show of flowers, of many different species; our new\r\nkitchen-garden was full of useful vegetables--young fruit-trees were\r\nyielding their produce wherever they had been planted--the poultry had\r\nmore than doubled their number--the calves were taking upon themselves\r\nthe full dignity of the state of cow and bull--the ewes had numerous\r\nlambs--and the pigs had not only grown into excellent pork, but had\r\nalready produced more than one litter, that would be found equally\r\ndesirable when provisions ran scarce.  We had two growing crops, of\r\ndifferent kinds of grain, and a large pasture-field fenced round.\r\n\r\nThe Little Savage, at seventeen, had been transformed into a farmer, and\r\nthe cultivation of the farm and the care of the live stock soon left him\r\nno time for indulging in vain longings to leave the island, or useless\r\nregrets for the fair creature who, even in death, I had regarded as its\r\ngreatest ornament.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, still greater improvements, and still greater additions\r\nbecame visible.  We were establishing a dairy farm on a small scale, and\r\nas our herds and flocks, as well as the pigs and poultry, increased\r\nrapidly, we promised in a few years to be the most thriving farmers that\r\nhad ever lived in that part of the world by the cultivation of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nAlthough my first experimental voyage had proved so hazardous, now that\r\nI was better provided for meeting its perils, I became anxious to make\r\nanother attempt to circumnavigate the island.  The boat that had\r\nbelonged to the wrecked ship, from the frequent trips I had made in her\r\nto and from the shore, I could manage as well as if I had been rowing\r\nboats all my life.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Mrs Reichardt, who pulled an oar almost as well\r\nas myself, we could get her along in very good style, even when heavily\r\nladen, and our labours together had taken from her all that timidity\r\nwhich had deterred her from trusting herself with me, when I first\r\nventured from the island.\r\n\r\nI was, however, very differently circumstanced now, to what I was then.\r\nInstead of a frail cockle-shell, that threatened to be capsized by every\r\nbillow that approached it, and that would scarcely hold two persons\r\ncomfortably, I was master of a well-built ship's boat, that would hold\r\nhalf a dozen with ease, and except in very rough weather, was as safe as\r\nany place ashore.\r\n\r\nI had repaired the slight damage its timbers had received, and had made\r\nan awning to protect us when rowing, from the heat of the sun; I had\r\nalso raised a sail, which would relieve us of a good deal of labour.\r\nWhen everything was prepared, I urged Mrs Reichardt to accompany me in\r\na voyage round the island; an excursion I hoped would turn out equally\r\npleasant and profitable.\r\n\r\nI found her very averse to trusting herself farther from shore than was\r\nabsolutely necessary.  She raised all kinds of objections--prominent\r\namong which were my want of seamanship for managing a boat in the open\r\nsea; the danger that might arise from a sudden squall coming on; her\r\nfear of our getting amongst a shoal of sharks, and the risk we ran of\r\ndriving against a projecting rock; but I overruled them all.\r\n\r\nI showed her, by taking little trips out to sea, that I could manage the\r\nboat either with the sail or the oars, and assured her that by keeping\r\nclose to the island, we could run ashore before danger could reach us;\r\nand that nothing could be easier than our keeping out of the reach of\r\nboth rocks and sharks.\r\n\r\nI do not think I quite convinced her that her fears were groundless; but\r\nmy repeated entreaties, the fineness of the weather, and her dislike to\r\nbe again left on the island, whilst I was risking my life at sea,\r\nprevailed, and she promised to join me in this second experiment.\r\n\r\nHer forethought, however, was here as fully demonstrated as on other\r\noccasions, for she did not suffer the boat to leave the shore till she\r\nhad provided for any accident that might prevent our return the\r\nanticipated time.\r\n\r\nA finer day for such a voyage we could not have selected.  The sky was\r\nwithout a cloud, and there was just wind enough for the purpose I\r\nwanted, without any apprehensions of this being increased.  I got up the\r\nawning, and spread the sail, and handing Mrs Reichardt to her appointed\r\nseat, we bid farewell to our four-footed and two-footed friends ashore,\r\nthat were gazing at us as if they knew they were parting from their only\r\nprotectors.  I then pushed the boat off, the wind caught the sail, and\r\nshe glided rapidly through the deep water.\r\n\r\nI let her proceed in this way about a quarter of mile from the island,\r\nand then tacked; the boat, obedient to the position of the sail, altered\r\nher course, and we proceeded at about the same rate, for a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt, notwithstanding her previous fears, could not help\r\nfeeling the exhilarating effect of this adventurous voyage.  We were\r\nfloating, safely and gracefully, upon the billows, with nothing but sea\r\nand sky in every direction but one, where the rugged shores of our\r\nisland home gave a bold, yet menacing feature to the view.\r\n\r\nMy heart seemed to expand with the majestic prospect before me.  Never\r\nhad mariner, when discovering some prodigious continent, felt a greater\r\ndegree of exultation than I experienced when directing my little vessel\r\nover the immense wilderness of waters that spread out before me, till it\r\njoined the line of the horizon.\r\n\r\nI sat down by the side of Mrs Reichardt, and allowed the boat to\r\nproceed on its course, either as if it required no directing hand, or\r\nthat its present direction was so agreeable, I felt no inclination to\r\nalter it.\r\n\r\n\"I can easily imagine,\" said I, \"the enthusiasm of such men as Columbus,\r\nwhose discovery of America you were relating to me the other day.  The\r\nvocation of these early navigators was a glorious one, and, when they\r\nhad tracked their way over so many thousand miles of pathless water, and\r\nfound themselves in strange seas, expecting the appearance of land,\r\nhitherto unknown to the civilised world, they must have felt the\r\nimportance of their mission as discoverers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, Frank,\" she replied; \"and probably, it was this that\r\nsupported the great man you have just named, in the severe trials he was\r\nobliged to endure, on the very eve of the discovery that was to render\r\nhis name famous to all generations.  He had endured intolerable\r\nhardships, the ship had been so long without sight of land, that no one\r\nthought it worth while to look out for it, and he expected that his crew\r\nwould mutiny, and insist on returning.  At this critical period of his\r\nexistence, first one indication of land, and then another, made itself\r\nmanifest; the curiosity of the disheartened sailors became excited; hope\r\nrevived in the breast of their immortal captain; a man was now induced\r\nto ascend the main-top, and his joyful cry of land woke up the\r\nslumbering spirit of the crew.  In this way, a new world was first\r\npresented to the attention of the inhabitants of the old.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me very unjust,\" I observed, \"that so important a\r\ndiscovery should have become known to us, not by the name of its\r\noriginal discoverer, but by that of a subsequent visitor to its shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mrs Reichardt, \"it is apparently unfair that\r\nAmericus Vespucius should obtain an honour which Christopher Columbus\r\nalone had deserved.  But of the fame which is the natural right of him\r\nwhose courage and enterprise procured this unrivalled acquisition, no\r\none can deprive him.  His gigantic discovery may always be known as\r\nAmerica, but the world acknowledges its obligation to Columbus, and\r\nknows little beyond the name of his rival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the immediate results of so large an addition to geographical\r\nknowledge, as beneficial to the entire human race as they ought to have\r\nbeen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think they were.  The vast continent then thrown open to the\r\nadvance of civilisation, may be divided into two portions,--the south\r\nand the north.  The former was inhabited by a harmless effeminate race,\r\nwho enjoyed many of the refinements of civilisation; their knowledge of\r\nthe arts, for instance, as shown to us in the ruins of their cities, was\r\nconsiderable; they possessed extensive buildings in a bold and ornate\r\nstyle of architecture; they made a lavish use of the precious metals, of\r\nwhich the land was extremely rich, and they wore dresses which showed a\r\ncertain perfection in the manufacture of textile fabrics, and no slight\r\ndegree of taste and art in their formation.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards, who were led to this part of the continent by a desire\r\nto enrich themselves with the gold which the earliest discoverers had\r\nfound in the new country in considerable quantities, invaded the\r\nterritories of this peaceful people, and, by their superior knowledge of\r\nwarlike weapons, and the ignorance of the intentions of their invaders\r\nthat prevailed amongst the natives of all ranks, by a series of\r\nmassacres, they were enabled, though comparatively but a small force, to\r\nobtain possession of the vast empire that had been established there\r\nfrom time immemorial, and turn it into a Spanish colony.\r\n\r\n\"The blood of this harmless race flowed like water; their great Incas or\r\nEmperors were deposed and murdered, their splendid temples plundered of\r\ntheir riches, their nobles and priests tortured to make them change\r\ntheir faith, and the great mass of the people became slaves to their\r\nmore warlike conquerors.  It was in this way the gold of Mexico and Peru\r\nenriched the treasury of Spain; but every ingot had the curse of blood\r\nupon it, and from that time the Spanish power, then at its height, began\r\nto decline in Europe, till it sunk in the scale of nations among the\r\nleast important.  The colonies revolted from the mother country, and\r\nbecame independent states; but the curse that followed the infamous\r\nappropriation of the country, seems to cling to the descendants of the\r\nfirst criminals, and neither government nor people prospers; and it is\r\nevident that all these independent states must in time be absorbed by a\r\ngreat republic, that has sprung up by peaceable means, as it were at\r\ntheir side, whilst they were content to be colonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what republic do you allude?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may remember that I told you that the entire continent was divided\r\ninto south and north.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The history of the southern portion I have rapidly sketched for you,\r\nthat of the northern you will find of a totally different character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray let me hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When North America was first discovered, it was found to be inhabited\r\nby a race of savages, divided into several tribes.  They had no\r\nmanufactures; they had no knowledge of art or science; they lived in the\r\nimpenetrable woods in huts, having no pretension to architecture; they\r\nwent almost entirely naked, were extremely warlike, and fond of hunting,\r\nand were known to devour the enemies they killed in battle.\r\n\r\n\"To this barbarous race came a few adventurous men across the stormy\r\nAtlantic, from the distant island of England--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, England!\"  I exclaimed, \"that is the country of my parents--that is\r\nthe home of my grandfather; let me hear anything you have to say about\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt smiled at my animation, but proceeded without making any\r\ncomment upon what I had said.\r\n\r\n\"England possessed at this period many adventurous spirits, who were\r\nready to dare every danger to obtain for their country a share in the\r\nhonours which other lands had assumed through the enterprise of their\r\nnavigators.  By such men different portions of the northern continent of\r\nAmerica were discovered; the fame of these new lands, their wonderful\r\nproductiveness and admirable climate, soon spread amongst their\r\ncountrymen, and from time to time various ships left the English ports\r\nwith small bands of adventurers, who made what were termed settlements\r\nin the country of these savages--not by mercilessly massacring them as\r\nthe Spaniards had done in the south, and then plundering them of all\r\nthey possessed, but by purchasing certain districts or pieces of land\r\nfrom the original occupants, which they peacefully cultivated; as their\r\nnumbers increased, they multiplied their habitations, and obtained by\r\nbarter of the savages fresh accessions of territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"The English showed themselves a much more humane people than the\r\nSpaniards,\" I observed.  \"But did they never come into collision with\r\nthe wild natives of the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently,\" Mrs Reichardt replied; \"but in some measure this was\r\nunavoidable.  As new settlers from England landed in the country, they\r\nrequired more land; but the savages were now not inclined to barter;\r\nthey had become jealous of the strangers, and were desirous of driving\r\nthem back to their ships before they became too numerous.  Acts of\r\nhostility were committed by the savages upon the settlers, which were\r\noften marked by great brutality: this exasperated the latter, who joined\r\nin a warlike association, and notwithstanding their numbers and daring,\r\ndrove them further and further from their neighbourhood, till either by\r\nconquest, treaties, or purchase, the Englishmen or their descendants\r\nobtained the greater portion of North America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they still hold possession of it?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Up to a recent date, the whole of this vast acquisition was a colony in\r\nobedience to the government of England; but a dispute having arisen\r\nbetween the mother country and the colony, a struggle took place, which\r\nended in the hatter throwing off all subjection to the laws of England.\r\nThe extensive provinces joined together in a union of equal privileges\r\nand powers, which has since gone by the name of the Government of the\r\nUnited States of North America.  This is the great republic to which I\r\njust now alluded, that is gradually absorbing the minor Southern States\r\ninto its union, and threatens at no very distant date to spread the\r\nEnglish language and the English race over the whole continent of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has England then completely lost the country she colonised?\"  I\r\ninquired, feeling more and more interested in the subject.\r\n\r\n\"No, a great portion still remains in her possession,\" she replied.\r\n\"The people preserved their allegiance when their neighbours thought\r\nproper to rise in revolt, and are now in a state of great prosperity,\r\ngoverned by the laws of England, and supported by her power.  The\r\nEnglish possessions in North America form an extensive district.  It is,\r\nhowever, but an inconsiderable fraction of the vast countries still\r\nremaining under the dominion of England.  Her territories lie in every\r\nquarter of the globe; indeed the sun never sets upon this immense\r\nempire--an empire with which the conquests of Alexander, and of Caesar,\r\nor the most formidable state that existed in ancient times, cannot for a\r\nmoment be compared; and when we bear in mind that in all these various\r\nclimates, and in all these far-distant shores, the flag of our country\r\naffords the same protection to the colonist as he would enjoy in his own\r\nland, we may entertain some idea of the vast power that government\r\npossesses which can make itself respected at so many opposite points\r\nfrom the source whence it emanates.\"\r\n\r\nI was so much interested in this description, that I had neglected to\r\nnotice the rate at which the boat was driving through the water.  I now\r\nrose with great alacrity to shift the sail, as we had got several miles\r\nfrom the island, and if I did not take care we might be blown out of\r\nsight of land.  I lost no time in putting her on another tack, but we\r\nhad not proceeded far in this direction when I found the wind lull, and\r\npresently the sail drooped to the mast, and there was a dead calm.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary now to take to our oars, and we were presently\r\npulling with all our strength in the direction of land.  This went on\r\nfor some time till we were both tired, and I was surprised at the little\r\nprogress we had made.  We lay on our oars and took some refreshment, and\r\nthen pulled with additional vigour; but I began to suspect that we were\r\nreceding from the land instead of approaching it, and called Mrs\r\nReichardt's attention to the fact of the island diminishing in size,\r\nnotwithstanding the length of time we had been pulling towards it.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Frank,\" she said, in a melancholy tone of voice, \"I have for some\r\ntime entertained suspicions that all our strength was being expended in\r\nvain.  It is very clear that we have got into a current that is every\r\nmoment taking us further out to sea, and if a breeze does not soon\r\nspring up, we shall lose sight of the island, and then heaven only knows\r\nwhat will become of us.\"\r\n\r\nI shook out the sail, in hopes of its catching sufficient wind to lead\r\nus out of the current, but not a breath of air was stirring.  We did not\r\npossess such a thing as a compass; our provisions were only calculated\r\nfor a pleasure trip--we had only one small jar of water, and a flask of\r\nspirit, a few biscuits, two large cakes, a chicken, and some dried fish.\r\nThe land was rapidly receding; I could only mark its position with\r\nrespect to the sun, that now was pouring its burning rays upon our\r\nlittle bark.  If it had not been for the awning, we could not have\r\nendured it; the heat was so oppressive.  We had been obliged to give\r\nover rowing, as much from the fatigue it occasioned as from the\r\nhopelessness of our labour.\r\n\r\nWe now sat with sinking hearts watching the fast-retreating land.  It\r\nhad become a point--it diminished to a speck, and as it disappeared from\r\nour anxious sight, the sun set in all his glory, and we were drifting at\r\nthe mercy of the current we knew not where, with nothing but sky and sea\r\nall around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nVainly I stretched my eyes around the illimitable field of ocean, in\r\nhope of discerning some indication of that power whose ships I had been\r\ntold traversed every sea; but nothing like a vessel was in sight--the\r\nmighty waters stretched out like an endless desert on every side.  There\r\nwas no sign of man in all this vast space, except our little boat; and\r\nin comparison with this space, how insignificant were the two helpless\r\nhuman beings who sat silent and motionless in that boat awaiting their\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nThe stars came out with marvellous brilliancy.  I fancied that I had\r\nnever seen them appear so bright; but probably the gloominess of my\r\nthoughts made them look brighter by contrast.  I seemed the centre of a\r\nglorious system of worlds revolving above me with a calm and tranquil\r\nbeauty, that appeared to reproach me for giving way to despair in a\r\nscene so lovely.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of water, scarcely moved by a ripple, now appeared lit up\r\nwith countless fires, and a purplish haze, like a low flame, was visible\r\nin every direction.  I directed the attention of my companion to this\r\nstrange appearance.  Notwithstanding the intensity of her anxiety, she\r\nimmediately entered into an explanation of the phenomenon, and\r\nattributed it to a peculiarly phosphoric state of the sea, caused by\r\nmyriads of creatures which possess the quality of the glowworm, and\r\nrising to the surface of the water, made the latter seem as though\r\nenveloped in flame.\r\n\r\nI sat a long time watching the singular appearances that presented\r\nthemselves whenever I dashed down the oar.  It looked as though I was\r\nbeating fire instead of water, and flame seemed to come from the oar\r\nwith the drops that fell from it into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn this way hours passed by: we were still floating with the current;\r\nthe moon and stars were now coldly shining over our heads; the ocean\r\naround us was still gleaming with phosphoric fires, when Mrs Reichardt\r\nadvised me to take some nourishment, and then endeavour to go to sleep,\r\nsaying she would keep watch and apprise me if anything happened of which\r\nit might be advantageous to avail ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I desired was the appearance of a vessel, or the setting\r\nin of a breeze, of which at present not a sign existed.  I felt\r\ndisinclined either to eat or to drink: but I proposed that my companion\r\nshould make a meal and then go to sleep, as it was much more proper that\r\nI should keep watch than herself.  The fact was, we were both anxious\r\nthat the other should be the first to diminish our little stock of food;\r\nbut as neither would be induced to do this, it was decided that our\r\nprovisions should be divided into certain portions, which were only to\r\nbe taken at sunrise and sunset, and that we should during the night\r\nrelieve each other every three hours in keeping watch, that if we saw\r\nland, or a ship, or the wind should spring up, we might consult\r\nimmediately as to our course.\r\n\r\nI only succeeded in inducing her to lie down at the bottom of the boat,\r\nto obtain a little sleep, previously to her taking my place, that I\r\nmight so rest myself.  She first said her usual prayers for the evening,\r\nin which I joined, and in a few minutes I was glad to hear by her\r\nregular breathing, that she was obtaining that repose of which I was\r\ncertain she stood greatly in need.\r\n\r\nI was now the sole observer of the stupendous spectacle that spread out\r\naround and above me; the most sublime feature in this imposing scene\r\nappeared to be the silence which reigned supreme over all.  The heavens\r\nwere as mute as the sea.  It looked as if the earth had been engulfed by\r\na second deluge, and all living nature had perished utterly from the\r\nface of it.\r\n\r\nI felt a deep feeling of melancholy stealing over me, and could not\r\nforbear reproaching myself for embarking in this hazardous enterprise,\r\nand risking a life that I was bound to preserve.  What could become of\r\nus both I knew not; but I was sensible that if we were not speedily\r\npicked up, or made some friendly shore, there existed but little hopes\r\nof our surviving many days.\r\n\r\nI made up my mind, that the island we should never see again; and though\r\nI had been so anxious for so many years to quit it, now that fate had\r\nseparated us for ever, I could not console myself for the loss of a home\r\nendeared to me by so many recollections.  But my great grief was the\r\nloss of my grandfather's diamonds.  He had now no chance of having them\r\nrestored to him.  If they were found, they would become the property of\r\nthe discoverer; and he would never know how his daughter perished on a\r\nrock, and how his grandson was swallowed up by the waters of the great\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nAnd then I thought of that glorious England I had so long hoped to see,\r\nand my heart sunk within me as I gazed out upon the boundless prospect.\r\nThere was not a voice to murmur consolation, not a hand to offer me\r\nassistance.  Was I never to see those white cliffs which had been so\r\noften described to me, that I could call them to mind as clearly as if\r\nthey stood in all their pride and beauty before my eyes?\r\n\r\nHow often had I dreamed of approaching the hallowed shores of England--\r\nhow often had I heard the cheerful voices of her people welcoming the\r\nLittle Savage to his natural home--how often had I been embraced by my\r\naged grandfather, and received into the happy circle of his friends,\r\nwith the respect and affection due to his heir.  I had dreamed happy\r\ndreams, and seen blissful visions; and the result was starvation in an\r\nopen boat on the illimitable ocean.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt still slept, and I would not wake her.  As long as she\r\nwas insensible to the dangers of her position, she must exist in\r\ncomparative happiness; to disturb her was to bring her back to a sense\r\nof danger and misery, and the recollection that my folly had brought her\r\nto this hopeless state.\r\n\r\nI noticed that a small cloud was making its appearance in the horizon,\r\nand almost at the same instant I observed it, I felt a breeze that was\r\njust sufficient to flap the sail against the mast.  In a few minutes the\r\ncloud had greatly increased, and the wind filled the sail.  I fancied it\r\nblew in a direction contrary to the current; but in the belief that it\r\ndid so, I soon got the boat round, and to my great joy she was presently\r\nscudding before the wind at a rate that was sensibly increasing.\r\n\r\nBut the cloud presently began to envelop the heavens, and a thick\r\ndarkness spread itself like a veil in every direction.  The wind blew\r\nvery fresh, and strained the mast to which the sail had been fixed; and\r\nnow I began to entertain a new fear: some sudden gust might take the\r\nsail and capsize us, or tear it from its fastenings.  I would gladly\r\nhave taken in the sail, but I considered it as rather a hazardous\r\nexperiment.  Mrs Reichardt lay in a position that prevented my getting\r\nat it without disturbing her, or running the risk of tipping the boat\r\nover, when it would be sure to fill immediately, and sink with us both.\r\nThough we could both swim, I felt assured that if we were once in the\r\nwater, there would remain very little chance of our protracting our\r\nlives beyond a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe boat, therefore, continued to run before the wind at a rapid rate,\r\nthe slight mast creaking, and the sail stretching so tight, I expected\r\nevery minute that we should be upset.  At this moment Mrs Reichardt\r\nawoke, and her quick eye immediately took in the full extent of our\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be lost,\" she said, hurriedly, \"if we do not take in that\r\nsail!\"\r\n\r\nI was fully aware of this, but she had seen more of a sailor's perils\r\nthan I had, and knew better how to meet them.  She offered to assist me\r\nin taking in the sail, and directing me to be very careful, we\r\nproceeded, with the assistance of the awning, to the mast, and after a\r\ngood deal of labour, and at some risk of being blown into the sea, we\r\nsucceeded in furling the sail, and unshipping the mast.\r\n\r\nWe were now in quite as much danger from another cause--the surface of\r\nthe sea, which had been so smooth during the calm, was now so violently\r\nagitated by the wind, that the boat kept ascending one great billow only\r\nto descend into the trough of another.  We often went down almost\r\nperpendicularly, and the height seemed every moment increasing; and\r\nevery time we went thus plunging headlong into the boiling waters, I\r\nthought we should be engulfed never to rise; nevertheless, the next\r\nminute, up we ascended on the crest of some more fearful wave than any\r\nwe had hitherto encountered, and down again we plunged in the dark\r\nunfathomable abyss that, walled in by foaming mountains of water,\r\nappeared yawning to close over us for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was almost entirely dark; we could see only the white foam of the\r\nwave over which we were about to pass: save this, it was black below and\r\nblack above, and impenetrable darkness all around.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt sat close to me with her hand in mine--she uttered no\r\nexclamations of feminine terror--she was more awe-struck than\r\nfrightened.  I believe that she was fully satisfied her last hour had\r\ncome, for I could hear her murmuring a prayer in which she commended her\r\nsoul to her Creator.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I was in any great degree alarmed--the rapid\r\nup-and-down motion of the boat gave me a sensation of pleasure I had\r\nnever before experienced.  To say the truth, I should have greatly\r\nenjoyed being thus at the mercy of the winds and waves, in the midst of\r\na black and stormy night on the trackless ocean, had it not been for my\r\nconstant thoughts of my companion, and my bitter self-reproaches for\r\nhaving led her into so terrible a danger.\r\n\r\nI was now, however, called from these reflections, by the necessity of\r\nactive employment.  The boat I found shipped water at every plunge, and\r\nif speedy means were not taken to keep the water under, there was little\r\ndoubt that she would soon fill and go down.  I therefore seized the iron\r\nkettle we had brought with us to cook our dinner, and began rapidly\r\nbaling out the water, which was already over our ankles.  We continued\r\nto ship water, sometimes more and sometimes less; and Mrs Reichardt,\r\nactuated no doubt by the same motives as myself, with a tin pan now\r\nassisted me in getting rid of the treacherous element.\r\n\r\nBy our united exertions we kept the water under, and hoped to be able to\r\nget rid of the whole of it.  About this time it began to rain very\r\nheavily, and although the awning protected our heads, so much fell into\r\nthe boat, that notwithstanding our labours, we continued to sit in a\r\npool.\r\n\r\nWe were, however, glad to find that as the rain fell, the wind abated\r\nand as the latter subsided, the sea became less violent, and we shipped\r\nless water.  I was now able by my own exertions to keep the boat\r\ntolerably dry, and Mrs Reichardt, ever provident, spread out all the\r\nempty vessels she had brought with her to catch the rain; for as she\r\nsaid, we did not know how valuable that water might become in a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe rain continued to pour down in a perfect torrent for several hours;\r\nat the end of which the sky gradually cleared.  The sea, though still\r\nrough, presented none of those mountainous waves that a short time\r\nbefore had threatened to annihilate us at every descent, and there was\r\njust sufficient breeze to waft us along at a brisk rate with the\r\nassistance of our sail.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt helped me in putting up the mast, and directly we began\r\nto feel the breeze, she insisted on my taking some refreshment.  It was\r\nvitally necessary to both, for our labours had been heavy for several\r\nhours.  We therefore ate sparingly of our provisions, and washed down\r\nour meal with a pannikin of water mingled with a little spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SIX.\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned upon a boundless expanse of sea.  The first object\r\nthat presented itself to my sight was an enormous whale spouting water,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile distant from me; then I observed another, then\r\na third, and subsequently, several more: they presented a singular and\r\npicturesque appearance, as one or other of these vast animals was\r\ncontinually throwing up a column of water that caught the rays of the\r\nsun, and looked very beautiful in the distance.\r\n\r\nI looked in vain for land; I looked equally in vain for a ship; there\r\nwas nothing visible but this shoal of whales, and Mrs Reichardt\r\nendeavoured to cheer me by describing the importance of the\r\nwhale-fishery to England, and the perils which the men meet with who\r\npursue the fish for the purpose of wounding them with an iron instrument\r\ncalled a harpoon.\r\n\r\nI felt much interest in these details; and my companion went into the\r\nwhole history of a whaling expedition, describing the first discovery of\r\nthe huge fish from the ship; the pursuit in the boats, and the\r\nharpooning of the whale; its struggles after having been wounded; its\r\nbeing towed to the ship's side; the subsequent manufacture of oil from\r\nthe blubber of the animal, and the preparation of whalebone.\r\n\r\nIn attending to this discourse, I completely, forgot that I was being\r\ntossed about in the open sea, I knew not where; and where I might be in\r\na short time it would be proved I was equally ignorant: perhaps I should\r\nbe a corpse floating on the surface of the ocean, waiting for a tomb\r\ntill a shark came that way; perhaps I should be suffering the torments\r\nof hunger and thirst; perhaps cast lifeless upon a rock, where my\r\nbleached bones would remain the only monument which would then declare\r\nthat there once existed in these latitudes, such a being as the Little\r\nSavage.\r\n\r\nWhere now could be the island I, though long so anxious to quit, now was\r\na thousand times more desirous of beholding?  I felt that nothing could\r\nbe more agreeable to me than a glimpse of that wild rocky coast that had\r\nso often appeared to me the walls of an intolerable prison.\r\n\r\nI strained my eyes in vain in every direction; the line of the horizon\r\nstretched out uninterrupted by a single break of any kind all around.\r\nWhere could we be?  I often asked myself; but except that we were on the\r\nwide ocean, neither myself nor my companion had the slightest idea of\r\nour geographical position.  We must have been blown a considerable\r\ndistance during the storm: much further than the current had taken us\r\nfrom the island.\r\n\r\nI calculated that we must have passed it by many a mile, if we had\r\ncontinued the same course; but the wind had shifted several times, and\r\nit might be that we were not so very long a sail from it, could we gain\r\nthe slightest knowledge of the direction in which it was to be found.\r\nBut this was hopeless.  I felt assured that we must abandon all idea of\r\nseeing it again.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these painful reflections, my companion directed my\r\nattention to an object at a very considerable distance, and intimated\r\nher impression that it was a ship.  Luckily, I had brought my glass with\r\nme, and soon was anxiously directing it to the required point.  It was a\r\nship: but at so great a distance that it was impossible, as Mrs\r\nReichardt said, for any person on board to distinguish our boat.  I\r\nwould have sailed in that direction, but the wind was contrary: I had,\r\ntherefore, no alternative but to wait till the ship should approach near\r\nenough to make us out; and I passed several hours of the deepest anxiety\r\nin watching the course of the distant vessel.\r\n\r\nShe increased in size, so that I could observe that she was a large ship\r\nby the unassisted eye; but as we were running before the wind in a\r\ntotally different direction, there seemed very little chance of our\r\ncommunicating, unless she altered her course.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt mentioned that signals were made by vessels at a distance\r\nto attract each other's attention, and described the various ways in\r\nwhich they communicated the wishes of their respective captains.  The\r\nonly signal I had been in the habit of making was burning quantities of\r\nwood on the shore and pouring water on it to make it smoke--this was\r\nimpossible in our boat.\r\n\r\nMy companion at last suggested that I should tie a tablecloth to the\r\nmast; its peculiar whiteness might attract attention.  The sail was\r\npresently taken in, and the tablecloth spread in its place; but,\r\nunfortunately, it soon afterwards came on a dead calm--the breeze died\r\naway, and the cloth hung in long folds against the mast.\r\n\r\nNo notice whatever was taken of us.  We now took to our oars and pulled\r\nin the direction of the ship; but after several hours' hard rowing, our\r\nstrength had so suffered from our previous fatigues, that we seemed to\r\nhave made very little distance.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the sun set, and we watched the object of all our hopes\r\nwith most anxious eyes, till night set in and hid her from our sight.\r\nShortly afterwards a light breeze again sprung up; with renewed hope we\r\ngave our sail to the wind, but it bore us in a contrary direction, and\r\nwhen morning dawned we saw no more of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe wind had now again shifted, and bore us briskly along.  But where?\r\nI had fallen asleep during the preceding night, wearied out with labour\r\nand anxiety, and I did not wake till long after daybreak.  Mrs\r\nReichardt would not disturb me.  In sleep I was insensible to the\r\nmiseries and dangers of my position.  She could not bring herself to\r\ndisturb a repose that was at once so necessary to mind and body; and I\r\nfell into a sweet dream of a new home in that dear England I had prayed\r\nso often to see; and bright faces smiled upon me, and voices welcomed\r\nme, full of tenderness and affection.\r\n\r\nI fancied that in one of those faces I recognised my mother, of whose\r\nlove I had so early been deprived, and that it was paler than all the\r\nothers, but infinitely more tender and affectionate: then the\r\ncountenance seemed to grow paler and paler, till it took upon itself the\r\nlikeness of the fair creature I had buried in the guano, and I thought\r\nshe embraced me, and her arms were cold as stone, and she pressed her\r\nlips to mine, and they gave a chill to my blood that made me shake as\r\nwith an ague.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I beheld Jackson with his sightless orbs groping towards me\r\nwith a knife in his hand, muttering imprecations, and he caught hold of\r\nme, and we had a desperate struggle, and he plunged a long knife into my\r\nchest, with a loud laugh of derision and malice; and as I felt the blade\r\nenter my flesh, I gave a start and jumped up, and alarmed Mrs Reichardt\r\nby the wild cry with which I awoke.\r\n\r\nHow strongly was that dream impressed upon my mind; and the features of\r\nthe different persons who figured in it--how distinctly they were\r\nbrought before me!  My poor mother was as fresh in my recollection as\r\nthough I had seen her but yesterday, and the sweetness of her looks as\r\nshe approached me--how I now tried to recall them, and feasted on their\r\nmemory as though it were a lost blessing.\r\n\r\nThen the nameless corpse that had been washed from the wreck, how\r\nstrange it seemed, that after this lapse of time she should appear to me\r\nin a dream, as though we had been long attached to each other, and her\r\naffections had been through life entirely my own.  Poor girl!  Perhaps\r\neven now some devoted lover mourns her loss; or hopes at no distant date\r\nto be able to join her in the new colony, to attain which a cruel\r\ndestiny had forced her from his arms.  Little does he dream of her\r\nnameless grave under the guano.  Little does he dream that the only\r\ncolony in which he is likely to join her, is that settlement in the\r\ngreat desert of oblivion, over which Death has remained governor from\r\nthe birth of the world.\r\n\r\nBut the most unpleasant part of the vision was the appearance of\r\nJackson; and it was a long time before I could bring myself to believe\r\nthat I had not beheld his well-known features--that I had not been\r\nstabbed by him, and that I was not suffering from the mortal wound he\r\nhad inflicted.  I however at last shook off the delusion, and to Mrs\r\nReichardt's anxious inquiries replied only that I had had a disagreeable\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nIn a short time I began to doubt whether the waking was more pleasant\r\nthan the dreaming--the vast ocean still spread itself before me like a\r\nmighty winding-sheet, the fair sky, beautiful as it appeared in the rays\r\nof the morning sun, I could only regard as a pall--and our little bark\r\nwas the coffin in which two helpless human beings, though still\r\nexisting, were waiting interment.\r\n\r\n\"Has God abandoned us?\"  I asked my companion; \"or has He forgotten that\r\ntwo of His creatures are in the deepest peril of their lives, from which\r\nHe alone can save them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!  Frank Henniker,\" exclaimed Mrs Reichardt, solemnly; \"this is\r\nimpious.  God never abandons those who are worthy of His protection.  He\r\nwill either save them at His own appointed time--or if He think it more\r\ndesirable, will snatch them from a scene where so many dangers surround\r\nthem, and place them where there prevails eternal tranquillity and\r\neverlasting bliss.\r\n\r\n\"We should rather rejoice,\" she added, with increasing seriousness,\r\n\"that we are thought worthy of being so early taken from a world in\r\nwhich we have met with so many troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to die in this way,\" I observed gloomily; \"to be left to linger out\r\ndays of terrible torture, without a hope of relief--I cannot reconcile\r\nmyself to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must die sooner or later,\" she said, \"and there are many diseases\r\nwhich are fatal after protracted suffering of the most agonising\r\ndescription.  These we have been spared.  The wretch who lingers in\r\ntorment, visited by some loathsome disorder, would envy us, could he see\r\nthe comparatively easy manner in which we are suffered to leave\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not myself see the hopelessness of our case,\" she added.  \"It\r\nis not yet impossible that we may be picked up by a ship, or discover\r\nsome friendly shore whence we might obtain a passage for England.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no prospect of this,\" said I; \"we are apparently out of the track\r\nof ships, and if it should be our chance to discover one, the people on\r\nboard are not likely to observe us.  I wish I had never left the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt never reproached me--never so much as reminded me that it\r\nwas my own fault.  She merely added, \"It was the will of God.\"\r\n\r\nWe ate and drank our small rations--my companion always blessing the\r\nmeal, and offering a thanksgiving for being permitted to enjoy it.  I\r\nnoticed what was left.  We had been extremely economical, yet there was\r\nbarely enough for another day.  We determined still further to reduce\r\nthe trifling portion we allowed ourselves that we might increase our\r\nchance of escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nFive days and nights had we been drifting at the mercy of the winds and\r\nwaves; all our small stock of food had been devoured--though we had\r\nhoarded every crumb, as the miser hoards his gold.  Even the rain-water,\r\nas well as the water we had brought with us, we had drained to the last\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\nThe weather continually alternated from a dead calm to a light breeze:\r\nthe wind frequently shifted, but I had no strength left to attend to the\r\nsail--the boat was abandoned to its own guidance, or rather to that of\r\nthe wind.  When becalmed, we lay still; when the breeze sprung up, we\r\npursued our course till the sail no longer felt its influence.\r\n\r\nFive long days and nights--days of intolerable suffering, nights of\r\ninexpressible horror.  From sunrise to sunset I strained my eyes along\r\nthe line of the horizon, but nothing but sky and wave ever met my gaze.\r\nWhen it became dark, excited by the deep anxiety I had endured\r\nthroughout the day, I could not sleep.  I fancied I beheld through the\r\ndarkness monstrous forms mocking and gibbering, and high above them all\r\nwas reared the head of the enormous python I had combated in the Happy\r\nValley.  And he opened his tremendous jaws, as though to swallow me, and\r\ndisplayed fold upon fold of his immense form, as if to involve and crush\r\nthe boat in its mighty involutions.\r\n\r\nI was always glad when the day dawned, or if the night happened to be\r\nfair and starlight; for the spectres vanished when the sun shone, and\r\nthe tranquil beauty of the stars calmed my soul.\r\n\r\nI was famishing for want of food--but I suffered most from want of\r\nwater, for the heat during the day was tremendous, and I became so\r\nfrantic from thirst, that nothing but the exhortations of Mrs Reichardt\r\nwould have prevented me from dashing myself into the sea, and drinking\r\nmy fill of the salt-water that looked so tempting and refreshing.\r\n\r\nMy companion sought to encourage me to hope, long after all hope had\r\nvanished--then she preached resignation to the Divine will, and in her\r\nown nature gave a practical commentary on her text.\r\n\r\nI perceived that her voice was getting more and more faint--and that she\r\nwas becoming hourly more feeble.  She was not able to move from her\r\nseat, and at last asked me to assist her to lie down at the bottom of\r\nthe boat.  Then I noticed that she prayed fervently, and I could often\r\ndistinguish my name in these petitions to the throne of Grace.\r\n\r\nI felt a strange sensation in my head, and my tongue became in my mouth\r\nas a dry stick--from this I was relieved by chewing the sleeve of my\r\nshirt; but my head grew worse.  My eyes too were affected in a strange\r\nmanner.  I continually fancied that I saw ships sailing about at a\r\nlittle distance from me, and I strove to attract their attention by\r\ncalling to them.  My voice was weak, and I could create only a kind of\r\nhalf-stifled cry.  Then I thought I beheld land: fair forests and green\r\npastures spread before me--bright flowers and refreshing fruits grew all\r\naround--and I called to my companion to make haste, for we were running\r\nashore and should presently be pulling the clustering grapes and should\r\nlay ourselves down among the odorous flowers.\r\n\r\nMrs Reichardt opened her eyes and gazed at me with a more painful\r\ninterest.  She knew I was haunted by the chimeras created by famine and\r\nthirst; but she seemed to have lost all power of speech.  She motioned\r\nme to join her in prayer; I, however, was too much occupied with the\r\nprospect of landing, and paid no attention to her signs.\r\n\r\nPresently the bright landscape faded away, and I beheld nothing but the\r\nwide expanse of water, the circle of which appeared to expand and spread\r\ninto the sky, and the sky seemed lost and broken up in the water, and\r\nfor a few minutes they were mixed together in the wildest and strangest\r\nconfusion.  Subsequently to this I must have dropped asleep, for after a\r\nwhile I found myself huddled up in a corner of the boat, and must have\r\nfallen there from my seat.  I stared about me for some time unconscious\r\nwhere I was.  The bright sun still shone over my head; the everlasting\r\nsea still rolled beneath my feet.\r\n\r\nI looked to the bottom of the boat, and met the upturned gaze of my\r\nfellow voyager.  The pale face had grown paler, and the expression of\r\nthe painful eye had become less intelligent.  I thought she was as I had\r\nseen her in my dream when she changed from her own likeness to that of\r\nthe poor drowned girl we buried in the guano.\r\n\r\nI turned away my gaze--the sight was too painful to look upon.  I felt\r\nassured that she was dying, and that in a very short space of time, that\r\nfaithful and affectionate nature I must part from for ever.\r\n\r\nI thought I would make a last effort--though faint and trembling,\r\nburning with fever, and feeling deadly sick, I managed by the support of\r\nthe awning to crawl to the mast, and embracing it with one arm, I raised\r\nthe glass with the other hand, and looked carefully about.  My hand was\r\nvery unsteady and my eyes seemed dim.  I could discern nothing but\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nI should have sunk in despair to the bottom of the boat, had I not been\r\nattracted at the moment by a singular appearance in the sky.  A cloud\r\nwas approaching, of a shape and appearance I had never observed before.\r\nI raised the glass again, and after observing this cloud for some time\r\nwith great attention, I felt assured that what I considered to be long\r\nlines of vapour was an immense flock of birds.\r\n\r\nThis discovery interested me--I forgot the intensity of my sufferings in\r\nobserving the motions of this apparently endless flock.  As the first\r\nfile approached, I looked again, to see if I could make out what they\r\nwere.  God of Heaven!  They were gannets.\r\n\r\nI crawled back to my companion as rapidly as my feeble limbs would\r\nallow, to inform her of the discovery I had made.  Alas!  I found that I\r\nwas unheeded.  I could not believe that her fine spirit had fled: no,\r\nshe moved her hand; but the dull spiritless gaze seemed to warn me that\r\nher dissolution was fast approaching.  I looked for the spirit-flask,\r\nand found a few drops were still left there; I poured these into her\r\nmouth, and watched the result with the deepest anxiety I had ever known\r\nsince the day of my birth.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes I found that she breathed more regularly and\r\ndistinctly--presently her eyes lost that fixedness which had made them\r\nso painful to look upon.  Then she recognised me, and took hold of my\r\nhand, regarding me with the sweet smile with which I was so familiar.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I found that consciousness had returned, I told her of the\r\ngreat flock of gannets that were evidently wending their way to their\r\ncustomary resting-place, and the hope I entertained that if they could\r\nbe kept in sight, and the wind remained in the same quarter, the boat\r\nmight be led by them to the place where they laid their eggs.\r\n\r\nShe listened to me with attention, and evidently understood what I said.\r\nHer lips moved, and I thought she was returning thanks to God--\r\naccepting the flight of the birds as a manifest proof that he was still\r\nwatching over us.  In a few minutes she seemed so much better that she\r\ncould sit up.  I noticed her for some time watching the gannets that now\r\napproached in one vast cloud that threatened to shut us out from the\r\nsky--she then turned her gaze in an opposite direction, and with a smile\r\nof exultation that lit up her wan face as with a glory, stretched her\r\narm out, pointing her hand to a distant portion of the sea.  My gaze\r\nquickly followed hers, and I fancied I discovered a break in the line of\r\nthe horizon; but it did not look like a ship.  I pointed the glass in\r\nthat direction, and felt the joyful assurance that we were within sight\r\nof land.\r\n\r\nThis additional discovery gave me increased strength or rather hope now\r\ndawning upon us, gave me an impulse I had not felt before.  I in my turn\r\nbecame the consoler.  I encouraged Mrs Reichardt, with all the\r\narguments of which I was master, to think that we should soon be in\r\nsafety.  She smiled, and something like animation again appeared in her\r\npale features.\r\n\r\nIf I could save her, I felt I should be blessed beyond measure.  Such an\r\nobject was worth striving for; and I did strive.  I know not how it was\r\nthat I gained strength to do what I did on that day; but I felt that I\r\nwas supported from on High, and as the speck of land that she had first\r\ndiscovered gradually enlarged itself as we approached it, my exertions\r\nto secure a speedy rescue for my companion from the jaws of death,\r\ncontinued to increase.\r\n\r\nThe breeze remained fair, and we scudded along at a spanking rate, the\r\ngannets keeping us company all the way--evidently bound to the same\r\nshore.  I kept talking to Mrs Reichardt, and endeavouring to raise her\r\nspirits with the most cheering description of what we should do when we\r\ngot ashore; for God would be sure to direct us to some place where we\r\nmight without difficulty recover our strength.\r\n\r\nHitherto she had not spoken; but as soon as we began to distinguish the\r\nfeatures of the shore we were approaching, she unclosed her lips, and\r\nagain the same triumphant smile played around them.\r\n\r\n\"Frank Henniker, do you know that rock?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!--yes!--can it be possible?  O what a gracious Providence has been\r\nwatching over us!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a rock of a remarkable shape that stood a short distance from the\r\nfishing-pool.  It could not be otherwise, the gannets had led us to\r\ntheir old haunts.  We were approaching our island.  I looked at my\r\ncompanion--she was praying.  I immediately joined with her in\r\nthanksgiving for the signal mercy that had been vouchsafed to us, and in\r\nlittle more than an hour had the priceless satisfaction of carrying her\r\nfrom the shore to the cottage, and then we carefully nursed ourselves\r\ntill we recovered the effects of this dreadful cruise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nMy numerous pursuits, as I stated in a preceding chapter, obliging me to\r\nconstant occupation, kept me from useless repining about my destiny, in\r\nbeing obliged to live so many years on this far-distant corner of the\r\nearth.  I had long ceased to look for passing ships--I scarcely ever\r\nthought about them, and had given up all speculations about my\r\ngrandfather's reception of me.  I rarely went out to sea, except to\r\nfish, and never cared to trouble myself about anything beyond the\r\nlimited space which had become my inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe reader, then, may judge of my surprise when, one sultry day, I had\r\nbeen busily engaged for several hours cutting down a field of wheat,\r\nMrs Reichardt came running to me with the astounding news that there\r\nwas a ship off the island, and a boat full of people had just left her\r\nand were rowing towards the rocks.  I hastily took the glass she had\r\nbrought with her, and as soon as I could get to a convenient position,\r\nthrew myself on the ground on the rock, and reconnoitred through the\r\nglass the appearance of the newcomers.\r\n\r\nI soon noticed that a part were well armed, which was not the case with\r\nthe rest, for they were pinioned in such a manner that they could\r\nscarcely move hand or foot.  We concealed ourselves by lying our lengths\r\non the grass.  As the boat approached, I could discern that the unarmed\r\nparty belonged to a superior class of men, while many of the others had\r\ncountenances that did not prepossess me at all in their favour.\r\n\r\nWe lay hid in the long grass, from which we could command a view of our\r\napproaching visitors.\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand this,\" whispered Mrs Reichardt.  \"There is\r\nmischief here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I not better run home and get arms?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, \"you had better not.  If we are able to do any good,\r\nwe must do it by stratagem.  Let us watch their movements, and act with\r\ngreat caution.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion's advice was, I saw, the wisest that could be pursued; and\r\ntherefore we remained in our hiding-places, narrowly observing our\r\nvisitors as they approached.  They entered the fishing-pool, and I could\r\nthen distinctly not only see, but hear them.  To my extreme surprise,\r\none of the first men who jumped out of the boat was John Gough, who had\r\nbrought Mrs Reichardt to the island.  He looked older, but I recognised\r\nhim in a moment, and so did my companion.  Her admonitory \"Hush!\" kept\r\nme from betraying the place of our concealment--so great was my\r\nastonishment, having long believed him and all his lawless associates to\r\nhave been lost at sea.\r\n\r\nHe was well armed, and evidently possessed some authority; nevertheless,\r\nI thought I could detect an air of concern in his features, as he\r\noffered to help one of the captives out of the boat.  The latter,\r\nhowever, regarded him with an air of disdain, and, though his hands were\r\ntied behind him, leaped ashore without assistance.  He was a man of\r\ncommanding stature, with a well-bronzed face, and a look of great energy\r\nof character.  He wore a band of gold lace round his cap, and had on\r\nduck trousers, and a blue jacket and waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Captain!\" exclaimed John Gough, \"I bear you no malice.  Though\r\nyou have been rather hard upon us, we won't leave you to starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a deuced deal better off than he desarves to be,\" cried a man from\r\nthe boat, whom I at once recognised as the fellow on whom I had drawn my\r\nknife for hurting Nero.  \"If we had made him walk the plank, as I\r\nproposed, I'm blowed if it wouldn't have been much more to the purpose\r\nthan putting him on this here island, with lots o' prog, and everything\r\ncalkilated to make him and his domineering officers comfortable for the\r\nrest of their days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, you mutineering rascal,\" exclaimed the Captain,\r\nangrily; \"a rope's end at the yard-arm will be your deserts before\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank ye kindly, Captain,\" replied the fellow, touching his hat in\r\nmockery.  \"But you must be pleased to remember I ain't caught yet; and\r\nwe means to have many a jolly cruise in your ship, and get no end o'\r\ntreasure, before I shall think o' my latter end; and then I means to die\r\nlike a Christian, and repent o' my sins, and make a much more edifying\r\nexample than I should exhibit dangling at the end of a rope.\"\r\n\r\nThe men laughed, the Captain muttered something about \"pirates and\r\nmutineers,\" but the rest of the officers wisely held their tongues.\r\n\r\nI now noticed an elderly man of very respectable appearance, who was not\r\npinioned like the rest.  His hair was quite white, his complexion very\r\npale, and he looked like one oppressed with deep sorrow and anxiety.  He\r\nrose from his seat in the boat, and was assisted out by John Gough.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry that we are obliged to leave you here, Mr Evelyn,\" said\r\nGough, \"but you see sir, we have no alternative.  We couldn't keep you\r\nwith us, for many reasons; and therefore we have been obliged to make\r\nyou a sharer in the fate of our officers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And werry painful this is to our feelings, sir, you may believe,\" said\r\nanother of the mutineers, mockingly.  \"I'm quite moloncholy as I thinks\r\non it.\"\r\n\r\nThe men again laughed; but the person so addressed walked to the side of\r\nthe Captain without making any observation.  The other captives also\r\nleft the boat in silence.  They were eight in all, but four of them were\r\nevidently common seamen by their dress--the others were officers.  All\r\nwere well-made strong men.\r\n\r\n\"What a precious pretty colony you'll make, my hearties!\" exclaimed one\r\nof the mutineers, jeeringly, as he helped to land a cask, and some other\r\npackages, that they had brought with them.  \"It's a thousand pities you\r\nain't got no female associates, that you might marry, and settle, and\r\nbring up respectable families.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking of women,\" cried the one who had first spoken, \"I wonder what\r\nbecame of the one we left here so cleverly when we was wrecked at this\r\nhere place six years ago.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gough looked uneasy at this inquiry, as if the recollection was not\r\nagreeable to him.\r\n\r\n\"And the Little Savage,\" continued the fellow, \"what was a-going to send\r\nhis knife into my ribs for summat or other--I forget what.  They must\r\nhave died long ago, I ain't no doubt, as we unfortnitely left 'em\r\nnothin' to live upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt they died hand in hand, like the Babes in the Wood,\" said\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nI still observed John Gough; he seemed distressed at the turn the\r\nconversation had taken.\r\n\r\n\"Now, mates,\" he said, hurriedly, \"let us return to the ship.  We have\r\ndone what we came to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I votes as we shall go and see arter the missionary's woman and the\r\nLittle Savage,\" cried the fourth.  \"I should like, somehow, to see\r\nwhether they be living or not, and a stroll ashore won't do any on us\r\nany harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall remain here till you return,\" said John Gough; and he threw\r\nhimself on the grass with his back towards me, and only a few yards from\r\nthe place in which we were concealed.  The rest, after making fast the\r\nboat, started off on an exploring expedition, in the direction of the\r\nold hut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY NINE.\r\n\r\nThe captives were grouped together, some sitting, and some standing.\r\nNot one of them looked dejected at his fate; though I could see by their\r\nmovements that they were impatient of the bonds that tied them.  My\r\nattention was most frequently directed to the old gentleman who had been\r\naddressed as Mr Evelyn.  Notwithstanding the grief expressed in his\r\ncountenance, it possessed an air of benevolence and kindness of heart\r\nthat even his settled melancholy did not conceal.  I could not\r\nunderstand why, but I felt a deeper interest for this person than for\r\nany of the others--a sort of yearning towards him, mingled with a desire\r\nto protect him from the malice of his enemies.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as they were gone, John Gough beckoned to Mr Evelyn to\r\nsit down by his side.  Possibly this was done to prevent his assisting\r\nhis companions to regain their liberty, as he, not being pinioned like\r\nthe rest, might easily have done, and they might have overpowered their\r\nguard before his companions could come to his assistance.  But Gough was\r\nwell armed, and the rest being without weapons of any kind, it was\r\nscarcely probable that they would have risked their lives on so\r\ndesperate an attempt.\r\n\r\nMr Evelyn came and quietly sat himself down in the place indicated.  I\r\nobserved him with increasing interest, and, singular to relate, the more\r\nI gazed on his venerable face, the more strongly I felt assured that I\r\nhad seen it before.  This of course was impossible; nevertheless, the\r\nfancy took possession of me, and I experienced a strange sensation of\r\npleasure as I watched the changes his features underwent.\r\n\r\n\"John Gough, I am sorry to see you mixed up in this miserable business,\"\r\nsaid he, mildly addressing his companion.  The other did not answer, and\r\nas his back was turned towards me, I could not observe the effect the\r\nobservation had upon him.\r\n\r\n\"The men who have left us, I know to be bad men,\" continued the speaker;\r\n\"I expect nothing but wickedness from them.  But you, I am aware, have\r\nbeen better brought up.  Your responsibility therefore becomes the\r\ngreater in assisting them in their villainy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better not let them hear you, Mr Evelyn,\" replied Gough, at\r\nlast, in something like a surly tone; \"I would not answer for the\r\nconsequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those I do not fear,\" the other answered.  \"The results of this\r\ntransaction can make very little difference to a man on the verge of the\r\ngrave, who has outlived all his relatives, and has nothing left to fall\r\nback upon but the memory of his misfortunes: but to one in the prime of\r\nlife like yourself, who can boast of friends and relatives who feel an\r\ninterest in your good name, these results must be serious indeed.  What\r\nmust be the feelings of your respectable father when he learns that you\r\nhave joined a gang of pirates; how intense must be the grief of your\r\namiable mother when she hears that you have paid the penalty that must\r\nsooner or later overtake you for embracing so lawless a life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Mr Evelyn,\" exclaimed Gough, though with a tremulousness in his\r\nvoice that betrayed the state of his feelings, \"you have no right to\r\npreach to me.  I have done as much as I could for you all.  The men\r\nwould have made short work with you if I had not interposed, and pointed\r\nout to them this uninhabited island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where it seems you left a poor woman to be starved to death,\" continued\r\nMr Evelyn.\r\n\r\n\"It was no fault of mine,\" replied the man; \"I did all I could to\r\nprevent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been more manly if you had remained with her on this\r\nrock, and left your cowardly associates to take their selfish course.\r\nBut you are weak and irresolute, John Gough; too easily persuaded into\r\nevil, too slow to follow the impulses of good.  The murder of that poor\r\nwoman is as much your deed as if you had blown her brains out before you\r\nabandoned her.  Indeed I do not know but what the latter would have been\r\nthe less criminal.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gough made no answer.  I do not think, however, his mind was quite\r\neasy under this accusation, for he seemed restless, and kept playing\r\nwith his pistols, with his eyes cast down.\r\n\r\n\"Your complicity in this mutiny, too, John Gough, is equally\r\ninexcusable,\" continued Mr Evelyn.  \"It was your duty to have stood by\r\nCaptain Manvers and his officers; by which you would have earned their\r\neternal gratitude, and a handsome provision from the owners of the\r\nvessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use talking of these things now, Mr Evelyn,\" said Gough,\r\nhurriedly.  \"I have taken my course.  It is too late to turn back.\r\nWould to God,\" he added, dashing his hand violently against his brow, \"I\r\nhad had nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is never too late, John Gough, to do good,\" here cried out Mrs\r\nReichardt, as she rose from her place of concealment, as much to my\r\nsurprise as that of all who could observe her.  But nothing could equal\r\nthe astonishment of Gough when he first caught sight of her features--he\r\nsprang to his feet, leaving his pistols on the ground, and clasping his\r\nhands together, exclaimed, \"Thank God, she is safe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, approaching him and taking his hand kindly.  \"By an\r\ninterposition of Providence you are saved from the guilt of one murder.\r\nIn the name of that God who has so signally preserved you against\r\nyourself, I command you to abandon your present wicked designs.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated, but it seemed as if he could not take his gaze from\r\nher face, and it was evident that her presence exerted an extraordinary\r\ninfluence over him.  In the mean time I had made my appearance on the\r\nscene, not less to the astonishment of the lookers-on; and my first act\r\nwas to take possession of the pair of pistols that Gough had left on the\r\nground; my next to hurry to the group of captives, who had been\r\nregarding us, in a state as it were of perfect bewilderment, and with my\r\nAmerican knife to cut their bonds.\r\n\r\n\"I will do whatever you think proper,\" said John Gough.  \"Believe me, I\r\nhave been reluctantly led into this, and joined the mutiny knowing that\r\nI should have been murdered if I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must endeavour to make what amends are in your power,\" continued\r\nMrs Reichardt, \"by assisting your officers in recovering possession of\r\nthe ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will gladly assist in whatever they may think feasible,\" said the\r\nman.  \"But we must first secure the desperate fellows who have just left\r\nus; and as we are but poorly provided with weapons, that of itself will\r\nbe a service of no slight danger.  To get possession of the ship I am\r\nafraid will be still more hazardous; but you shall find me in the front\r\nof every danger.\"  Here Captain Manvers and the others came up to where\r\nJohn Gough and Mrs Reichardt were conversing; he heard Gough's last\r\nspeech, and he was going to say something, when I interposed by stating\r\nthat there was no time now for explanations, for in a few minutes the\r\nfellows who had gone to the hut would return, and the only way to\r\nprepare for them was for the whole party to go to our house, to which\r\nMrs Reichardt would lead them, where they would find plenty of arms and\r\nammunition.  In the meantime I would keep watch, and observe their\r\nmotions, and by firing one of the pistols would signal to them if I was\r\nin any danger.  Lastly, I recommended that the oars should be removed\r\nfrom the boat, to prevent the mutineers making their escape to the ship.\r\n\r\nMy appearance and discourse attracted general attention.  I particularly\r\nnoticed that Mr Evelyn started as soon as he caught sight of me, and\r\nappeared to observe me with singular carefulness; but that, no doubt,\r\narose from my unexpected address, and the strange way in which I had\r\npresented myself before him.\r\n\r\nThe Captain approving of my proposal, the whole party, after taking away\r\nthe boat's oars, moved off rapidly in the direction of the house.  I\r\nagain concealed myself in the grass, and waited the return of the\r\nmutineers.  They did not remain away long.  I could hear them\r\napproaching, for they laughed and shouted as they went along, loud\r\nenough to be heard at a considerable distance.  When they began to\r\ndescend the rocks, they passed so close to me, that I could hear every\r\nword that was spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Well, flesh is grass, as the parson says,\" said Jack, \"they must have\r\ndied sooner or later, if we hadn't parted company with so little\r\nceremony.  But, hallo!  My eyes and limbs!  Where's John Gough?  Where's\r\nthe Captain?  Where's all on 'em?\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express the astonishment of the men on reaching the\r\nspot where they had so lately left their prisoners, and discovering that\r\nnot a trace of them was to be seen.  At first they imagined that they\r\nhad escaped in the boat, but as soon as they saw that the boat was safe,\r\nthey gave up that idea.  Then they fancied John Gough had taken the\r\nprisoners to stroll a little distance inland, and they began to shout as\r\nloud as their lungs would permit them.  Receiving no response, they\r\nuttered many strange ejaculations, which I could not then understand,\r\nbut which I have since learned were profane oaths; and seemed at a loss\r\nwhat to do, whether to wander about the island in search of them, or\r\nreturn to their ship.\r\n\r\nOnly one chanced to be for the former, and the others overruled him, not\r\nthinking it was worth their while to take so much trouble as to go\r\nrambling about in a strange place.  They seemed bent on taking to the\r\nboat, when one of them suggested they might get into a scrape if they\r\nreturned without their companion.  They finally resolved on sitting down\r\nand waiting his return.\r\n\r\nPresently, one complained he was very sleepy, as he had been too busy\r\nmutineering to turn into his hammock the previous night, and the others\r\nacknowledged they also felt an equal want of rest from the same cause.\r\nEach began to yawn.  They laid themselves at their full length along the\r\ngrass, and in a short time I could hear by their snoring, as Jackson\r\nused to do, that they were asleep.\r\n\r\nI now crept stealthily towards them on my hands and knees, and they were\r\nin such a profound sleep, that I had no difficulty whatever in removing\r\nthe pistols from their belts.  I had just succeeded in this, when I\r\nbeheld the Captain, and John Gough, and Mr Evelyn, and all the rest of\r\nthem, well armed with guns and pistols, approaching the place where we\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes afterwards the mutineers were made prisoners, without\r\ntheir having an opportunity of making the slightest resistance.  I was\r\nmuch complimented by the Captain for the dexterity with which I had\r\ndisarmed them; but while I was in conversation with him, it is\r\nimpossible to express the surprise I felt, on seeing Mr Evelyn suddenly\r\nrush towards me from the side of Mrs Reichardt, with whom he had been\r\ntalking, and embracing me with the most moving demonstrations of\r\naffection, claim me as his grandson.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was soon explained.  Mr Evelyn had met so many losses in\r\nbusiness as a merchant, that he took the opportunity of a son of his old\r\nclerk--who had become a captain of a fine ship, employed in the South\r\nAmerican trade--being about to proceed on a trading voyage to that part\r\nof the world, to sail in his vessel with a consignment of goods for the\r\nSouth American market.  He had also another object, which was to inquire\r\nafter the fate of his long-lost daughter and son-in-law, of whom he had\r\nreceived no certain intelligence, since the latter took ship with the\r\ndiamonds he had purchased to return home.  The vessel in which they\r\nsailed had never been heard of since; and Mr Evelyn had long given up\r\nall hopes of seeing either of them again, or the valuable property with\r\nwhich they had been intrusted.\r\n\r\nOn their going to the house, he had asked Mrs Reichardt my name,\r\nstating that I so strongly resembled a very dear friend of his he\r\nbelieved had perished many years ago, that he felt quite an interest in\r\nme.  The answer he received led to a series of the most earnest\r\ninquiries, and Mrs Reichardt satisfied him on every point, showed him\r\nall the property that had formerly been in the possession of Mrs\r\nHenniker and her husband; related Jackson's story, and convinced him,\r\nthat though he had lost the daughter for whom he had mourned so long,\r\nher representative existed in the Little Savage, who was saving him from\r\nthe fate for which he had been preserved by the mutineers.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that I had the happiness of restoring to my\r\ngrandfather the diamonds I had obtained from Jackson, which were no\r\ndoubt very welcome to him, for they not only restored him to affluence,\r\nbut made him one of the richest merchants upon Change.\r\n\r\nI was also instrumental in obtaining for the Captain the command of his\r\nship, and of restoring discipline amongst the crew.  The ringleaders of\r\nthe mutiny were thrown into irons, and taken home for trial; this\r\nresulted in one or two of them being hanged by way of example, and these\r\nhappened to be the men who so barbarously deserted Mrs Reichardt.  She\r\naccompanied me to England in Captain Manvers' vessel; for when he heard\r\nof the obligations I owed her, my grandfather decided that she should\r\nremain with us as long as she lived.  We however did not leave the\r\nisland, until we had shown my grandfather, the captain, and his\r\nofficers, what we had effected during our stay, and every one was\r\nsurprised that we could have produced a flourishing farm upon a barren\r\nrock.  I did not fail to show the places where I had had my fight with\r\nthe python, and where I had been pursued by the sharks, and my narrative\r\nof both incidents seemed to astonish my hearers exceedingly.\r\n\r\nI must not forget to add, that the day before our departure, John Gough\r\ncame to me privately, and requested my good offices with the Captain,\r\nthat he might be left on the island.  He had become a very different\r\ncharacter to what he had previously been; and as there could be no\r\nquestion that the repentance he assumed was sincere, I said all I could\r\nfor him.  My recommendation was successful, and I transferred to John\r\nGough all my farm, farming stock, and agricultural implements; moreover,\r\npromised to send him whatever he might further require to make his\r\nposition comfortable.  He expressed great gratitude, but desired\r\nnothing; only that his family might know that he was well off, and was\r\nnot likely to return.\r\n\r\nPerhaps John Gough did not like the risk he ran of being tried for\r\nmutiny, or was averse to sailing with his former comrades: but whatever\r\nwas the cause of his resolution, it is certain that he remained behind\r\nwhen the ship left the island, and may be there to this hour for all I\r\nknow to the contrary.\r\n\r\nWe made a quick voyage to England, and as my readers will be no doubt\r\nglad to hear, the Little Savage landed safely at Plymouth, and was soon\r\ncordially welcomed to his grandfather's house in London.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Little Savage, by Captain Frederick Marryat",
