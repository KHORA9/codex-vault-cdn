Weeks,\r\nin the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Vermont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nIt appears to the writer of the following pages, that a work of this\r\ndescription is much needed in our country.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the bee (Apis Mellifica) has been too long neglected in\r\nmost parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis general neglect has unquestionably originated from the fact, that the\r\nEuropean enemy to the bees, called the moth, has found its way into this\r\ncountry, and has located and naturalized itself here; and has made so much\r\nhavoc among the bees, that many districts have entirely abandoned their\r\ncultivation. Many Apiarians, and men of the highest literary attainments,\r\nas well as experience, have nearly exhausted their patience, in examining\r\nthe peculiar nature and habits of this insect; and have tried various\r\nexperiments to devise some means of preventing its depredations. But,\r\nafter all that has been done, the spoiler moves onward with little\r\nmolestation, and very few of our citizens are willing to engage in the\r\nenterprize of cultivating this most useful and profitable of all insects,\r\nthe honey-bee.\r\n\r\nThe following work is comprised in a set of plain, concise rules, by\r\nwhich, if strictly adhered to and practised, any person, properly\r\nsituated, may cultivate bees, and avail himself of all the benefits of\r\ntheir labors.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian manages strictly in accordance with the following rules,\r\nthe author feels confident that no colony will ever materially suffer by\r\nthe moth, or will ever be destroyed by them.\r\n\r\nThe author is aware of the numerous treatises published on this subject;\r\nbut they appear to him, for the most part, to be the result not so much of\r\nexperience as of vague and conjectural speculation, and not sufficiently\r\nembodying what is practical and useful.\r\n\r\nThis work is intended as an accompaniment to the Vermont hive, and will be\r\nfound to be the result of observation and experience, and it is thought\r\ncomprises all that is necessary to make a skilful Apiarian.\r\n\r\n                                                             THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER\r\n\r\n   Rule I.

The substance they use for this purpose is\r\nneither honey nor wax, but a kind of glue or cement of their own\r\nmanufacturing, and is used by the bees to fill up all imperfect joints and\r\nexclude all light and air. This cement or glue is very congenial to the\r\ngrowth of the moth in the first stages of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe moth miller enters the hive, generally, in the night--makes an\r\nincision into the glue or cement with her sting, and leaves her eggs\r\ndeposited in the glue, where it remains secure from the bees; it being\r\nguarded by the timber on its sides. Thus, while a maggot, (larva) the moth\r\nuses the cement for food until it arrives so far towards a state of\r\nmaturity as to be able to spin a web, which is more fully explained in\r\nremarks on Rule 10.\r\n\r\nThe size of a hive should be in accordance with the strictest rules of\r\neconomy, and adapted to the peculiar nature and economy of the honey-bee,\r\nin order to make them profitable to their owner.\r\n\r\nThe lower apartment of the hive, where they store their food, raise their\r\nyoung bees, and perform their ordinary labors, should hold as much as a\r\nbox thirteen inches and one half or fourteen inches square in the clear.\r\n\r\nIf the hive is much larger than the one described above, with the chamber\r\nin proportion, which should hold about two-thirds as much as the lower\r\napartment, the bees will not be likely to swarm during the season.\r\n\r\nBees in large hives never swarm; and those in hives much less than the one\r\nalready described, do but little else than raise young bees and lay up a\r\nsufficient quantity of food to supply them through the coming winter, and\r\nare more liable to be robbed.\r\n\r\nAll hives of bees that swarm are liable to swarm too much, and reduce\r\ntheir colonies so low in numbers as to materially injure them, and is\r\nfrequently the cause of their destruction by the moth, which is more\r\nparticularly explained in remarks on Rule 2.\r\n\r\nThe changer of the hive should be made perfectly tight, so as to exclude\r\nall light from the drawers.\r\n\r\nDrawers should be small like No. 2, for all purposes except such as are\r\nused for multiplying colonies and transferring, which should always be\r\nlarge like No. 1.\r\n\r\nHives should have elects on their sides, so as to suspend them in the air\r\nsome distance from the floor of the apiary, the better to secure the bees\r\nfrom destruction by mice, reptiles, and other vermin.\r\n\r\nThe back side or rear of the lower apartment of the hive should slant\r\nforward, so as to render the same smallest at the bottom, the better to\r\nsecure the combs from falling when cracked by frost or nearly melted in\r\nhot weather.\r\n\r\nNo timbers or boards should be placed very near the lower edge of the\r\nhive, because it facilitates the entrance of depredators. That the back\r\nside should slant forward, is obvious from the fact, that bees generally\r\nrest one edge of their combs on that side, and build towards the front in\r\nsuch a manner as to enter upon the same sheet where they intend to deposit\r\ntheir stores, when they first enter the hive, without being compelled to\r\ntake any unnecessary steps.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the hive should slant downward from rear to front, so as to\r\nafford the greatest facility to the bees to clear their tenement of all\r\noffensive substances, and let the water, which is occasioned by the breath\r\nand vapor of the bees, run off in cold water. It also aids the bees very\r\nmuch in preventing the entrance of robbers.\r\n\r\nThe bottom board should be suspended by staples and hooks near each corner\r\nof the hive, in such a manner as to afford a free entrance and egress to\r\nthe bees on all its sides, which will better enable them to keep their\r\ntenement clear of the moths.\r\n\r\nThere should be a button attached to the lower edge of the rear of the\r\nhive, so as to enable the apiarian to govern the bottom board in such a\r\nmanner as to give all the air they need, or close the hive at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe hive should have two sticks placed at equal distances, extending from\r\nfront to rear, resting on the rear, with a screw driven through the front\r\ninto the end of the stick, which holds it fast in its place, and a\r\nventilator hear the top of the lower apartment of the hive, to let off the\r\nvapor which frequently causes the death of the bees in the winter by\r\nfreezing.\r\n\r\nThe door to the chamber should be made to fit in the rabitings of the same\r\nagainst the jambs, in such a manner as to exclude the light from the\r\nwindows of the drawers, and also to prevent the entrance of the little\r\nants. It should also be hung by butts, or fastened by a bar, running\r\nvertically across the centre of the door, and confined by staples at each\r\nend. There should be three sheet-iron slides, one of which should be\r\nnearly as wide as the chamber, and one or two inches longer than the\r\nlength of the chamber. The other two should be the same length of the\r\nfirst, and half its width only.\r\n\r\nAll hives and all their appendages should be made exactly of a size and\r\nshape in the same apiary. The trouble of equalizing colonies is far less\r\nthan it is to accommodate hives to swarms. Much perplexity and sometimes\r\nserious difficulties occur, where the apiarian uses different sized hives\r\nand drawers. But this part of the subject will be more fully discussed\r\nunder its proper rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE II.\r\n\r\nON SWARMING AND HIVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apiarian, or bee-owner, should have his hives in readiness, and in\r\ntheir places in the apiary, with the drawers in their chambers bottom up,\r\nso as to prevent entrance.\r\n\r\nWhen a swarm comes forth and has alighted, cut off the limb if\r\nconvenient--shake it gently, so as to disengage the bees, and let them\r\nfall gently on to the table, board, or ground, (as the case may be,) place\r\nthe hive over them before many rise into the air, taking care at the same\r\ntime to lay one or more sticks in such a manner as to raise the hive so as\r\nto give the bees rapid ingress and egress. If the bees act reluctantly in\r\ntaking possession of their new habitation, disturb them by brushing them\r\nwith a goose-quill or some other instrument, not harsh, and they will soon\r\nenter. In case it is found necessary to invert the hive to receive the\r\nbees, (which is frequent, from the manner of their alighting,) then, first\r\nsecure the drawers down to the floor by inserting a handkerchief or\r\nsomething above them; now invert the hive and shake or brush the bees into\r\nit; now turn it gently right end up on the table, or other place,\r\nobserving the rule aforesaid.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nBees swarm from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon on a fair day, differing in the season according to the climate.\r\nIn Vermont they generally swarm from the middle of May to the fifteenth of\r\nJuly; in late seasons some later. I have known them to swarm as early as\r\nseven in the morning and as late as four in the afternoon. I have also\r\nknown them to come forth when it rained so hard as nearly to defeat them\r\nby beating down many to the ground which were probably lost from their\r\ncolony; and I once had a swarm come forth on the sixteenth day of August.\r\n\r\nExperience and observation have taught that the Queen leaves the old stock\r\nfirst, and her colony rapidly follow. They fly about a few minutes,\r\napparently in the greatest confusion, until the swarm is principally out\r\nof the hive. They then alight, generally on the limb of some tree, shrub,\r\nor bush, or some other place convenient for them to cluster in a bunch not\r\nfar from the old stock, and make their arrangements for a journey to a new\r\nhabitation. Perhaps not one swarm in a thousand knows where they are going\r\nuntil after they have left the old stock, alighted, and formed into a\r\ncompact body or cluster; and not then until they have sent off an embassy\r\nto search out a place for their future residence. Now if the bees are\r\nhived immediately after they have alighted, before they send off their\r\nembassy to seek a new tenement, they will never fly away, admitting they\r\nhave sufficient room, (for it is want of room that makes them swarm in the\r\nfirst place,) and their hive is clear of every thing that is offensive to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe old custom of washing hives with salt and water and other substances,\r\nto give them a pleasant effluvia, should be speedily abolished. Nothing\r\nbut bees should ever be put into a hive.\r\n\r\nWhen bees die, the hive should be cleared of its contents, and scraped out\r\nclean, and the chamber rubbed with cloth wet in clean water; then set it\r\nin its place in the apiary, and there let it stand until wanted for use.\r\nAn old hive, thus prepared, is as good as a new one for the reception of a\r\nswarm. The apiarian should examine before using to see that the hive is\r\nfree from spiders and cobwebs.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are not hived immediately after they have clustered in a body,\r\nthey should be removed to the apiary, or several rods from the place where\r\nthey alighted, as soon as they can be hived, to prevent their being found\r\non the return of the embassy. Since I have thus practised, I have never\r\nlost a swarm by flight.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught that it is best to remove the new swarm to the place\r\nwhere it is intended to stand during the season, immediately after hiving.\r\nFewer bees are lost by a speedy removal, than when permitted to stand\r\nuntil evening, because they are creatures of habit, and are every moment\r\nestablishing themselves in their location. It also prevents their being\r\nfound by the embassy when they return. The longer bees stand in the place\r\nwhere they are hived, the greater will be the number lost when removed.\r\nBut more of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are collected in drawers for the purpose of equalizing colonies,\r\nby doubling, &c., they should be permitted to stand until evening before\r\nthey are united, it being a more favorable time for them to become\r\nacquainted with each other by degrees; and the scent of the bees in the\r\nlower apartment will enter through the apertures during the night so much\r\nthat there is a greater degree of sameness in the peculiar smell of the\r\ntwo colonies, which takes off their animosity, if they chance to have\r\nany.\r\n\r\nNo confusion or noise which is uncommon to the bees should ever be made\r\nduring their swarming or hiving. The only effect of noise, ringing of\r\nbells, &tc., that I could ever discover, was, to render them more hostile\r\nand unmanageable.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are treated in accordance with their true nature, they are\r\nsometimes hostile, which originates from two causes: First, some of them\r\nlie out of the hive before swarming and some of them, in consequence of\r\ntheir confusion in swarming, are not apprised of the intention of the\r\nQueen to leave the old stock and seek a new habitations and they sally\r\nforth with the swarm without filling their sacks with stores, which always\r\nmakes them more irritable than when their stomachs are rilled with food.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont hive possesses advantages in this respect, as well as others,\r\nfar superior to the old box. Instead of lying out before swarming, as in\r\nthe old box, they go up into the drawers, and are constantly employed in\r\ndepositing the delicious fruits of their labors; and being in the hive,\r\nwhere they can hear and observe all the movements of the Queen, they go\r\nforth well stored with provisions suited to the peculiar exigency of the\r\ncase; which ordinarily prevents all feelings of hostility.\r\n\r\nThe second reason why bees are sometimes irritable, and are disposed to\r\nsting when they swarm, is, the air is forbidding to them, by being cold or\r\notherwise, so as to impede them in their determined emigration. In all\r\nsuch cases, the apiarian should be furnished with a veil, made of\r\nmillinet, or some light covering which may be worn over his hat, and let\r\ndown so low as to cover his face and bosom, and fixed in such a manner as\r\nto prevent their stinging. He should also put on a pair of thick woolen\r\ngloves or stockings over his hands, thus managing them without the least\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nA clean hive is all that is needed for a swarm of bees, with careful and\r\nhumane treatment.\r\n\r\nA cluster of bees should never be shook or jarred any more than merely to\r\ndisengage them from the limb or place where they are collected, nor should\r\nthey fall any great distance, because their sacks are full when they\r\nswarm, which renders them both clumsy and harmless, and harsh treatment\r\nmakes them irritable and unmanageable.\r\n\r\nI know of no rule by which the exact day of their first swarming can be\r\nknown with certainty. The apiarian will estimate near the time by the\r\nnumber of bees in and about the hive, as it will become very much\r\ncrowded.\r\n\r\nThe day of second swarming, and all after that during the same season, may\r\nbe most certainly predicted as follows: Listen near the entrance of the\r\nhive in the evening. If a swarm is coming forth the next day, the Queen\r\nwill be heard giving an alarm at short intervals. The same alarm may be\r\nheard the next morning. The observer will generally hear two Queens at a\r\ntime in the same hive, the one much louder than the other. The one making\r\nthe least noise is yet in her cell, and in her minority. The sound emitted\r\nby the Queens is peculiar, differing materially from that of any other\r\nbee. It consists of a number of monotonous notes in rapid succession,\r\nsimilar to those emitted by the mud-wasp when working her mortar and\r\njoining it to her cells, to raise miss-wasps. If, after all, the weather\r\nis unfavorable to their swarming two or three days while in this peculiar\r\nstage, they will not be likely to swarm again the same season.\r\n\r\nTwo reasons, and two only, can be assigned why bees ever swarm. The first\r\nis, want of room, and the second, to avoid the battle of the Queens. It is\r\nindeed true that there are exceptions. Perhaps one in a hundred swarms may\r\ncome forth before their hive is filled with comb; but from nearly forty\r\nyears experience in their cultivation, I never saw an instance of it,\r\nwhere the hive was not full of bees at their first swarming. When bees go\r\nfrom the old stock to the tree without alighting, it is when they lie out\r\nof the hive before swarming, and the embassy are sent forth before the\r\nswarm leaves the old stock. When the first swarm comes forth, eggs, young\r\nbrood, or both, are left in the combs, but no Queen; for the old Queen\r\nalways goes forth with the swarm, and leaves the old stock entirely\r\ndestitute. Not a single Queen, in any stage of minority, is left in the\r\nhive. The bees very soon find themselves destitute of the means of\r\npropagating their species, (for the Queen is the only female in the hive,)\r\nand immediately set themselves to work in constructing several royal\r\ncells, (probably to be more sure of success,) take a grub (larva) from the\r\ncell of a common worker, place it in the new-made royal cell, feed it on\r\nroyal jelly, and in a few days they a Queen. Now as the eggs are laid in\r\nabout three litters per week, the bees, to be still more sure of\r\nsucceeding in their enterprize, take maggots, differing in age, so that if\r\nmore than one Queen is hatched, one will be older than the others. This\r\nfact accounts for hearing more than one Queen at the same time, because\r\none comes out a perfect fly, while the other is a nymph, or little\r\nyounger, and has not yet made her escape from the cell where she was\r\nraised; and yet both answer the alarm of the other, the youngest more\r\nfeebly than the elder.\r\n\r\nBees will never swarm but once the same season unless they make more than\r\none Queen, immediately after the departure of the first swarm; and not\r\nthen, if the bees permit the oldest Queen to come in contact with the cell\r\nwhere the young ones are growing. Queens entertain the most deadly\r\nanimosity towards each other, and will commence an attack upon each other\r\nthe first moment opportunity offers. The old Queen will even tear all the\r\ncradles or cells to pieces where young ones are growing, and destroy all\r\nthe chrysalis Queens in the hive.\r\n\r\nIf the weather becomes unfavorable to swarming, the next day after the\r\nalarm of the Queen is heard, and continues so for several days, the oldest\r\nQueen may come in contact with the others, or gain access to their cells;\r\nin either case the life of one of them is destroyed by the other, and the\r\ncolony will not be likely to send forth another swarm the same season. If\r\nthe old Queen succeeds in taking the life of the younger, or _vice versa_,\r\nthe remaining nymphs will be likely to share the same fate of their\r\nmartyred sisters, by the hand of the reigning Queen, who considers all\r\nothers in the same hive as her competitors.\r\n\r\nSecond swarms would be as large and numerous as any others, if it was not\r\nthe fact that they come forth to avoid the battle of the Queens. Bees are\r\nvery tenacious to preserve the lives of their sovereigns, particularly\r\nthose of their own raising; and when they find they have more than one in\r\nthe hive, they will guard each so strong as to prevent, if possible, their\r\ncoming within reach of each other. They being thus strongly guarded to\r\nprevent the fight, is unquestionably the cause of their giving the alarm,\r\nas described in the foregoing article. The knowledge of the existence of\r\nanother Queen in the same hive inspires them with the greatest uneasiness\r\nand rage; and when the oldest one finds herself defeated in gaining access\r\nto her competitor, she sallies forth with as many as see fit to follow\r\nher, and seeks a new habitation.\r\n\r\nBees will not swarm but once in a season, if the second one does not come\r\nforth within seventeen days from the departure of the first, unless they\r\nswarm for want of room, in which case no Queen will be heard before\r\nswarming.\r\n\r\nThe drawers should be turned over, so as to let the bees into them as soon\r\nas they have built their combs nearly to the bottom of the hive. If the\r\nswarm is so large that the lower apartment will not hold all of them, they\r\nshould be let into one or both of the drawers, at the time of hiving;\r\notherwise they may go off for want of room. Bees should be let into the\r\ndrawers in the spring as soon as blossoms are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE III.\r\n\r\nON VENTILATING THE HIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate the bottom board and ventilator at pleasure, by means of the\r\nbutton or otherwise, so as to give them more or less air, as the\r\ncircumstances may require.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nBees require more air in order to enable them to endure the heat of summer\r\nand the severity of winter, than at any other time. If they are kept out\r\nin the cold, they need as much air in the winter as in the heat of summer.\r\nIt is in a mild temperature only, that it is safe to keep them from the\r\npure air. If placed below frost in a dry sand-bank, they seem to need\r\nscarcely more than is contained in their hive at the time they are buried,\r\nduring the whole winter. If kept in a clean, dry cellar, the mouth so\r\ncontracted as to keep out mice, gives them enough. But if they are kept in\r\nthe apiary, there should be a slow current of air constantly pressing in\r\nat the bottom and off at the top thro' the ventilator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE IV.\r\n\r\nON PREVENTING ROBBERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment it is observed, that robbers are within, or about the hive,\r\nraise the bottom board so near the edge of the hive as to prevent the\r\ningress or egress of the bees, and stop the mouth or common entrance and\r\nventilator. At the same time take care that a small space on all sides of\r\nthe hive be left open, so as to afford them all the air they need. Open\r\nthe mouth only at evening, and close early in the morning, before the\r\nrobbers renew their attack.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nBees have a peculiar propensity to rob each other, and every precaution\r\nnecessary to prevent it, should be exercised by the cultivator. Families\r\nin the same apiary are more likely to engage in this unlawful enterprize\r\nthan any others, probably because they are located so near each other, and\r\nare more likely to learn their comparative strength. I never could\r\ndiscover any intimacy between colonies of the same apiary, except when\r\nthey stood on the same bench; and then, all the social intercourse seems\r\nto subsist between the nearest neighbors only.\r\n\r\nBees are not likely to engage in warfare and rob each other, except in the\r\nspring and fall, and at other times in the season, when food is not easily\r\nobtained from blossoms.\r\n\r\nBees do not often engage in robbery in the spring, unless it is in such\r\nhives as have had their combs broken by frost or otherwise, so as to cause\r\nthe honey to drip down upon the bottom board. Much care should be\r\nexercised by the apiarian to see that all such hives are properly\r\nventilated, and at the same time closed in such a manner as to prevent the\r\nentrance of robbers in the day-time, until they have mended the breach, so\r\nas to stop the honey from running.\r\n\r\nClear water should be given them every day, so long as they are kept in\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nI have known many good stocks to be lost in the spring, by being robbed;\r\nand all for want of care. Bees rob each other when they can find but\r\nlittle else to do; they will rob at any time when frost has destroyed the\r\nflowers, or the weather is so cold as to prevent their collecting honey\r\nfrom them. Cold, chilly weather prevents the flowers from yielding honey\r\nwithout frost, as was the case in the summer of 1835, in many places.\r\n\r\nBees need but little air at any time when they rob, and yet more is\r\nnecessary for them when confined by compulsory means, than otherwise. When\r\ndeprived of their liberty, they soon become restless, and use their best\r\nefforts to make their way out of the hive--hence the importance of leaving\r\na small space all around the bottom, to admit air and to prevent their\r\nmelting down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE V.\r\n\r\nON EQUALIZING COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHive one swarm in the lower apartment of the hive; collect another swarm\r\nin a drawer, and insert the same in the chamber of the hive containing the\r\nfirst. Then, if the swarms are small, collect another small swarm in\r\nanother drawer, and insert the same in the chamber of the hive containing\r\nthe first, by the side of the second. In case all the bees from either of\r\nthe drawers, amalgamate and go below with the first swarm, and leave the\r\ndrawer empty, then it may be removed, and another small swarm added in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nIt is of prime importance to every bee cultivator, that all his colonies\r\nbe made as nearly equal in numbers and strength, as possible. Every\r\nexperienced bee-master must be aware that small swarms are of but little\r\nprofit to their owner. Generally, in a few days after they are hived, they\r\nare gone;--no one can trace their steps: some suppose they have fled to\r\nthe woods--others, that they were robbed: but after all, no one is able to\r\ngive any satisfactory account of them. Some pieces of comb only are left,\r\nand perhaps myriads of worms and millers finish off the whole. Then the\r\nmoth is supposed to be their destroyer, but the true history of the case\r\nis generally this: The bees become discouraged, or disheartened, for want\r\nof numbers to constitute their colony, abandon their tenement, and join\r\nwith their nearest neighbors, leaving their combs to the merciless\r\ndepredations of the moth. They are sometimes robbed by their adjoining\r\nhives, and then the moths finish or destroy what is left.\r\n\r\nSecond swarms are generally about half as large as the first, and third\r\nswarms half as large as second ones.\r\n\r\nNow if second swarms are doubled, so as to make them equal in number with\r\nthe first, the owner avails himself of the advantage of a strong colony,\r\nwhich will not be likely to become disheartened for want of numbers, nor\r\novercome by robbers from stronger colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is far less trouble, and less expense, for the bee-owner lo equalize\r\nhis colonies, than to prepare hives and drawers of different sizes to fit\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nWhen colonies and hives are made as near alike as possible, many evils are\r\navoided, and many advantages realized: every hive will fit a place in the\r\napiary--every drawer a hive, and every bottom board and slide may in any\r\ncase be used without mistakes.\r\n\r\nSwarms may be doubled at any time before they become so located as to\r\nresume their former hostility, which will not be discovered in less than\r\nthree or four days. Bees are provided with a reservoir, or sack, to carry\r\ntheir provision in; and when they swarm, they go loaded with provision\r\nsuited to their emergency, which takes off all their hostility towards\r\neach other; and until these sacks are emptied, they are not easily vexed,\r\nand as they are compelled to build combs before they can empty them, their\r\ncontents are retained several days. I have doubled, at a fortnight's\r\ninterval in swarming, with entire success. The operation should be\r\nperformed within two or three days--at the farthest four days. The sooner\r\nit is done, the less hazardous is the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, second swarms only should be doubled. Third and fourth\r\nswarms should always have their Queen taken from them, and the bees\r\nreturned to the parent stock, according to Rule 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VI.\r\n\r\nON REMOVING HONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsert a slide under the drawer, so far as to cut off all communication\r\nbetween the lower apartment and the drawer. Insert another slide between\r\nthe first slide and the drawer. Now draw out the box containing the honey,\r\nwith the slide that is next to it. Set the drawer on its window end, a\r\nlittle distance from the apiary, and remove the slide. Now supply the\r\nplace of the drawer, thus removed, with an empty one, and draw the first\r\ninserted slide.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nCare must be exercised in performing this operation. The apertures through\r\nthe floor into the chamber must be kept closed by the slides during the\r\nprocess, so as to keep the bees from rushing up into the chamber when the\r\nbox is drawn out. The operator must likewise see that the entrances into\r\nthe drawer are kept covered with the slide, in such a manner as to prevent\r\nthe escape of any of the bees, unless he is willing to be stung by them.\r\n\r\nIf the bees are permitted to enter the chamber in very warm weather, they\r\nwill be likely to hold the occupancy of it, and build comb there, which\r\nwill change the hive into one no better than an old-fashioned box.\r\n\r\nI have succeeded best in removing honey by the following method, to\r\nwit:--Shut the window-blinds so as to darken one of the rooms in the\r\ndwelling-house--raise up one casement of a window--then carry the drawer\r\nand place the same on a table, or stand, by the window, on its light or\r\nglass end, with the apertures towards the light. Now remove the slide, and\r\nstep immediately back into the dark part of the room. The bees will soon\r\nlearn their true condition, and will gradually leave the drawer, and\r\nreturn home to the parent stock; thus leaving the drawer and its contents\r\nfor their owner; not however until they have sucked every drop of running\r\nhoney, if there should chance to be any, which is not often the case, if\r\ntheir work is finished.\r\n\r\nThere are two cases in which the bees manifest some reluctance in leaving\r\nthe drawer. The first is, when the combs are in an unfinished state--some\r\nof the cells not sealed over. The bees manifest a great desire to remain\r\nthere, probably to make their stores more secure from robbers, by affixing\r\ncaps to the uncovered cells, to prevent the effluvia of running honey,\r\nwhich is always the greatest temptation to robbers.\r\n\r\nBees manifest the greatest reluctance in leaving the drawer, when young\r\nbrood are removed in it, which never occurs, except in such drawers as\r\nhave been used for feeding in the winter or early in the spring. When the\r\nQueen has deposited eggs in all the empty cells below, she sometimes\r\nenters the drawers; and if empty cells are found, she deposits eggs there\r\nalso. In either case, it is better to return the drawer, which will be\r\nmade perfect by them in a few days.\r\n\r\nSpecial care is necessary in storing drawers of honey, when removed from\r\nthe care and protection of the bees, in order to preserve the honey from\r\ninsects, which are great lovers of it, particularly the ant. A chest, made\r\nperfectly tight, is a good store-house.\r\n\r\nIf the honey in the drawers is to be preserved for winter use, it should\r\nbe kept in a room so warm as not to freeze. Frost cracks the combs, and\r\nthe honey will drip as soon as warm weather commences. Drawers should be\r\npacked with their apertures up, for keeping or carrying to market. All\r\napiarians who would make the most profit from their bees, should remove\r\nthe honey as soon as the drawers are rilled, and supply their places with\r\nempty ones. The bees will commence their labors in an empty box that has\r\nbeen filled, sooner than any others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VII.\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD OF COMPELLING SWARMS TO MAKE AND KEEP EXTRA QUEENS, FOR\r\nTHEIR APIARIAN, OR OWNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a drawer containing bees and brood comb, and place the same in the\r\nchamber of an empty hive; taking care to stop the entrance of the hive,\r\nand give them clean water, daily, three or four days. Then unstop the\r\nmouth of the hive, and give them liberty. The operator must observe Rule 6\r\nin using the slides.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of every colony depends entirely on the condition of the\r\nQueen, when the season is favorable to them.\r\n\r\nEvery bee-master should understand their nature in this respect, so as to\r\nenable him to be in readiness to supply them with another Queen when they\r\nchance to become destitute.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the fact, that bees have power to change the nature of\r\nthe grub (larva) of a worker to that of a Queen, is attributed to Bonner.\r\nBut neither Bonner nor the indefatigable Huber, nor any other writer, to\r\nmy knowledge, has gone so far in the illustration of this discovery as to\r\nrender it practicable and easy for common people to avail themselves of\r\nits benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont hive is the only one, to my knowledge, in which bees can be\r\ncompelled to make and keep extra Queens for the use of their owner,\r\nwithout extreme difficulty, as well as danger, by stings, in attempting\r\nthe experiment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of raising her royal highness, and elevating and establishing her\r\nupon the throne of a colony, may, by some, be deemed altogether visionary\r\nand futile; but I will assure the reader, that it is easier done than can\r\nbe described. I have both raised them, and supplied destitute swarms\r\nrepeatedly.\r\n\r\nWhen the drawer containing bees and brood comb is removed, the bees soon\r\nfind themselves destitute of a female, and immediately set themselves to\r\nwork in constructing one or more royal cells. When completed, which is\r\ncommonly within forty-eight hours, they remove a grub (larva) from the\r\nworker's cell, place the same in the new-made Queen's cell, feed it on\r\nthat kind of food which is designed only for Queens, and in from eight to\r\nsixteen days they have a perfect Queen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bees have safely deposited the grub in the new-made royal\r\ncell, the bees may have their liberty. Their attachment to their young\r\nbrood, and their fidelity to their Queen, in any stage of its minority, is\r\nsuch, that they will never leave nor forsake them, and will continue all\r\ntheir ordinary labors, with as much regularity as if they had a perfect\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nIn making Queens in small boxes or drawers, the owner will not be troubled\r\nby their swarming the same season they are made. There are so few bees in\r\nthe drawer, they are unable to guard the nymph Queens, if there are any,\r\nfrom being destroyed by the oldest, or the one which escapes from her cell\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIn examining the drawer, in which I raised an extra Queen, I found not\r\nonly the Queen, but two royal cells, one of which was in perfect shape;\r\nthe other was mutilated, probably by the Queen which came out first. Now\r\nwhen there are so few bees to guard the nymphs, it would not be very\r\ndifficult for the oldest Queen to gain access to the cells, and destroy\r\nall the minor Queens in the drawer.\r\n\r\nWhen a drawer is removed to an empty hive, for the purpose of obtaining an\r\nextra Queen, it should be placed some distance from the apiary, the better\r\nto prevent its being robbed by other swarms. When it is some distance from\r\nother colonies, they are not so likely to learn its comparative strength.\r\nThere is but little danger however, of its being robbed, until after the\r\nbees are out of danger of losing their Queen, which generally occurs in\r\nthe swarming season.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sometimes lost, in consequence of the young brood being too\r\nfar advanced at the time of the departure of the old Queen with her swarm.\r\nIf the grubs had advanced very near the dormant or chrysalis state, before\r\nthe bees learnt their necessity for a Queen, and the old Queen neglected\r\nto leave eggs, which is sometimes the case, then it would be impossible\r\nfor the bees to change their nature, and the colony would be lost, unless\r\nsupplied with another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE VIII.\r\n\r\nON SUPPLYING SWARMS, DESTITUTE OF A QUEEN, WITH ANOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake the drawer from the hive, which was placed there according to Rule 7,\r\nand insert the same into the chamber of the hive to be supplied; observing\r\nRule 6 in the use of the slides.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nColonies destitute of a Queen may be supplied with another the moment it\r\nis found they have none; which is known only by their actions.\r\n\r\nBees, when deprived of their female sovereign, cease their labors; no\r\npollen or beebread is seen on their legs; no ambition seems to actuate\r\ntheir movements; no dead bees are drawn out; no deformed bees, in the\r\nvarious stages of their minority, are extracted, and dragged out of their\r\ncells, and dropped down about the hive, as is usual among all healthy and\r\nprosperous colonies.\r\n\r\nColonies that have lost their Queen, when standing on the bench by the\r\nside of other swarms, will run into the adjoining hive without the least\r\nresistance. They will commence their emigration by running in confused\r\nplatoons of hundreds, from their habitation to the next adjoining hive.\r\nThey immediately wheel about and run home again, and thus continue,\r\nsometimes for several days, in the greatest confusion, constantly\r\nreplenishing their neighbor's hive, by enlarging her colony, and, at the\r\nsame time, reducing their own, until there is not a single occupant left;\r\nand remarkable as it is, they leave every particle of their stores for\r\ntheir owner or the depredations of the moth.\r\n\r\nColonies lose their Queens more frequently during the swarming season than\r\nany other.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830, I lost three good stocks of bees in consequence of\r\ntheir losing their Queens, one of which was lost soon after the first\r\nswarming--the two others not many days after the second swarming--all of\r\nwhich manifested similar actions, and ended in the same results, which\r\nwill be more particularly explained in remarks on Rule 10.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is sometimes lost, when she goes forth with a swarm, in\r\nconsequence of being too feeble to fly with her young colony; in which\r\ncase the bees return to their parent stock in a few minutes. In fact all\r\noccurrences of this kind originate in the inability of the Queen. If she\r\nreturns to the old stock, the swarm will come out again the next day, if\r\nthe weather is favorable. If the Queen is too feeble to return, and the\r\napiarian neglects to look her up, and restore her to her colony again,\r\n(which he ought to do,) the bees will not swarm again until they have made\r\nanother, or are supplied, which may be done immediately by giving them any\r\nspare Queen, I have done it with entire success, and never failed in the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, when lost in swarming, is easily found, unless the wind is so\r\nstrong as to have blown her a considerable distance. A few bees are always\r\nfound with her, which probably serve as her aids, and greatly assist the\r\napiarian in spying her out. She is frequently found near the ground, on a\r\nspire of grass, the fence, or any place most convenient for her to alight,\r\nwhen her strength fails her. I once had quite a search for her majesty,\r\nwithout much apparent success. At the same time there were flying about me\r\na dozen or more common workers. At last her royal highness was discovered,\r\nconcealed from my observation in a fold of my shirt sleeve. I then\r\nreturned her to her colony, which had already found their way home to the\r\nparent stock.\r\n\r\nThe Queen may be taken in the hand without danger, for she never stings by\r\ndesign, except when conflicting with another Queen; and yet she has a\r\nstinger at least one third longer, but more feeble than a worker.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is known by her peculiar shape, size, and movements. She differs\r\nbut little in color from a worker, and has the same number of legs and\r\nwings. She is much larger than any of the bees. Her abdomen is very large\r\nand perfectly round, and is shaped more like the sugar-loaf, which makes\r\nher known to the observer the moment she is seen. Her wings and proboscis\r\nare short. Her movements are stately and majestic. She is much less in\r\nsize after the season for breeding is over. She is easily selected from\r\namong a swarm, at any season of the year, by any one who has often seen\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE IX.\r\n\r\nON MULTIPLYING COLONIES TO ANY DESIRABLE EXTENT, WITHOUT THEIR SWARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis large drawer, No. 1, should always be used for this purpose. Insert\r\nslides, as in Rule 6, and remove the drawer containing bees and\r\nbrood-comb; place the same in the chamber of an empty hive; stop the\r\nentrances of both the new and old hives, taking care to give them air, as\r\nin Rule 4. Give clean water daily, three or four days. Now let the bees,\r\nin both hives, have their liberty.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThis operation is both practicable and easy, and is of prime importance to\r\nall cultivators, who wish to avoid the necessity of hiving them when they\r\nswarm; and yet it will not prevent swarming, except in that part of the\r\ndivided colony which contains the Queen at the time of their separation.\r\nThe other part being compelled to make another Queen, (and they generally\r\nmake two or more) will be likely to swarm to avoid their battle, as\r\nexplained in remarks on Rule 2. The hive containing the old Queen may\r\nswarm for want of room; but, at any rate, in performing the operation, it\r\nhas saved the trouble of hiving one swarm, and prevented all danger of\r\ntheir flight to the woods.\r\n\r\nMultiplying colonies by this rule is a perfectly safe method of managing\r\nthem, admitting they are not allowed to swarm themselves so low as to\r\nleave unoccupied combs, which will be explained in remarks on Rule 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE X.\r\n\r\nON PREVENTING THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE MOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll such stocks as are infested with the moth, will manifest it as soon as\r\nwarm weather commences in the spring, by dropping some of the worms upon\r\nthe bottom board. Let the apiarian clean off the bottom board every other\r\nmorning; at the same time strew on a spoonful or two of fresh, pulverized\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nImmediately after a second swarm has come forth from a hive, the same\r\nseason, the old stock should be examined; and if swarming has reduced\r\ntheir numbers so low as to leave unoccupied combs, the apiarian should\r\ntake the Queen from the swarm, and let them return to the old stock. In\r\ncase they remain in a cluster, hive them in a drawer, and return them\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThird and fourth swarms should always have their Queens taken from them\r\nand the bees returned to the parent stock.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\n\"This insect (the moth) is a native of Europe; but has found its way into\r\nthis country, and naturalized itself here.\"--THATCHER.\r\n\r\nThis unwelcome visitor has interested the attention and called forth all\r\nthe energies of the most experienced apiarians of our country, and of many\r\nof the greatest naturalists in the world. Their movements have been\r\nobserved and scrutinized by the most learned--their nature has been\r\nstudied; various experiments have been tried to prevent their\r\ndepredations; but after all, the monster in gaudy hue marches onward,\r\ncommitting the greatest havoc and devastation, with but little\r\nmolestation. I have lost my whole stock at least four times since 1808, as\r\nI supposed by the moth. I tried all the experiments recommended in this\r\nand other countries, that came to my knowledge; but after all, I could not\r\nprevent their ravages.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, I constructed a hive (which has since been patented) which I\r\nsupposed would afford all the facilities for managing bees in every manner\r\nthat their nature would admit of, and at the same time render their\r\ncultivation most profitable to their owner. By constructing windows of\r\nglass, on every side of the hive, nearly the size of its sides, and\r\ndarkening them by closing doors on the outside of the windows, which may\r\nbe opened at pleasure, I have been able to discover many important facts,\r\nboth in relation to the nature and economy of the bee, and its enemy the\r\nmoth; but, probably, much yet remains to be learned concerning both.\r\n\r\nThe moth, when first discovered by the common observer, is a white worm or\r\nmaggot, with a reddish crusted head, and varies in size according to its\r\nliving. Those which have full and unmolested access to the contents of a\r\nhive, will frequently grow as large as a turkey-quill, and an inch and a\r\nhalf in length. Others are scarcely an inch in length when full grown.\r\nThey have sixteen short legs, and taper each way from the centre of their\r\nbodies to their head and exterior or abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe worms, like the silk-worm, wind themselves into a cocoon, and pass the\r\ndormant (chrysalis) state of their existence, and in a few days come out\r\nof their silken cases perfect winged insects or millers, and are soon\r\nready to deposit their eggs, from which another crop will be raised.\r\n\r\nThe miller, or perfect moth, is of a grayish color, from three-fourths of\r\nan inch to an inch in length. They usually lie perfectly still in the day\r\ntime, with their head downwards, lurking in and about the apiary. They\r\nenter the hive in the night, and deposit their eggs in such places as are\r\nuncovered, of course unguarded by the bees. These eggs hatch in a short\r\ntime, varying according to circumstances, probably from two or three days\r\nto four or five months. At an early stage of their existence, while yet a\r\nsmall worm, they spin a web, and construct a silken shroud, or fortress,\r\nin which they envelope themselves, and form a sort of path, or gallery, as\r\nthey pass onward in their march; at the same time being perfectly secure\r\nfrom the bees, in their silken case, which they widen as they grow larger,\r\nwith an opening in their front only, near their head, they commit the\r\ngreatest havoc and devastation on the eggs, young bees and all, that come\r\nin their way as they pass.\r\n\r\nWhen the moth has arrived to his full state of maturity, he makes\r\npreparation to change to a miller, by winding into a cocoon, as has been\r\nalready explained. The miller is surprisingly quick in all its movements,\r\nexceeding by far the agility of the quickest bee, either in flight or on\r\nits legs. Hence the enemy becomes so formidable that the bees are easily\r\novercome and soon fall a sure prey to him.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to remedy the evils of the moths, and prevent their ravages,\r\nand at the same time aid the bees in their prosperity, and make them\r\nprofitable to their owner, I found it necessary to use a hive differing\r\nmaterially from the old box, and commenced operations in the one already\r\nreferred to, (called the Vermont hive,) in a course of experiments which\r\nhave produced results perfectly satisfactory. From six years experience in\r\nits use, I have not the least doubt that bees may be managed to the best\r\nadvantage, and without ever being materially injured by the moths.\r\n\r\nA bee-hive should be made in a perfect workmanlike manner, so as to have\r\nno open joints; the boards should be free from shakes and cracks, because\r\nthe bees will make their tenement perfectly tight, so as to exclude light\r\nand air, by plastering up all such places as are left open by the workman,\r\nwith a kind of mortar, or glue, of their own make, which is neither honey\r\nnor wax, but is very congenial to the growth of worms in the first stages\r\nof their larva state, and being secured from the bees by the timber, in a\r\nshort time they are able to defend themselves by a silken shroud.\r\n\r\nNow the miller enters the hive and makes an incision into the bee-glue, or\r\ncement, with her sting, and leaves her eggs. These eggs hatch there, and\r\nthe brood subsist on the glue until they have arrived so far toward\r\nmaturity as to enable them to encase themselves in a silken shroud; and\r\nthen they move onward.\r\n\r\nNow unless the bees chance to catch him by the collar, or nape of his\r\nneck, while feeding, and drag him out of his place of concealment, they\r\nwill be compelled to cut away the combs all around his silken path, or\r\ngallery, and drag out the worm and his fortress all together. At the same\r\ntime, the bees are compelled to cut away the combs so far as to destroy\r\nmany of their young brood in making room to remove the annoyance. I have\r\nknown them to cut away their combs from four to eight or ten inches to re\r\nmove this silken shroud, and have known them to cut and drag out their\r\nonly remaining Queen before she was transformed to the perfect fly, which\r\noccasioned the entire loss of the whole colony.\r\n\r\nRepeated experiments have demonstrated the fact, that placing bees on the\r\nground, or high in the air, is no security against the moths. I have lost\r\nsome of my best stocks by placing them on the ground, when those on the\r\nbench were not injured by them. I have made a groove in the bottom board,\r\nmuch wider than the thickness of the boards to the hive, and filled the\r\nsame with loam: I then placed the hive on the same, in such a manner as to\r\nprevent any crack or vacancy for the worms; and yet in raising the hive\r\nfour weeks afterwards, I found them apparently full grown all around the\r\nhive in the dirt. I have found them very plenty in a tree ninety feet from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe best method, in common practice, to prevent the depredations of the\r\nmoth, is, to suspend the bottom board so far below the lower edge of the\r\nhive as to give the bees free entrance and egress all around the same\r\nduring the moth season, or to raise the common hive, by placing under it\r\nlittle blocks at each corner, which produces nearly the same effect. But I\r\nknow of but one rule, which is an infallible one, to prevent their\r\ndepredations, and that is this: keep the combs well guarded by bees. See\r\nRule 10.\r\n\r\nLarge hives, that never swarm, are never destroyed by the moth, unless\r\nthey lose their Queen, melt down, or meet with some casualty, out of the\r\nordinary course of managing them. They are not often in the least annoyed\r\nby them, unless there are bad joints, cracks, or shakes, so as to afford\r\nsome lurking places for the worms. The reason for their prosperous\r\ncondition is obvious. The stock of bees are so numerous that their combs\r\nare all kept well guarded during the moth season, so that no miller can\r\nenter and deposit her eggs.\r\n\r\nHives made so small as to swarm, are liable to reduce their colonies so\r\nsmall as to leave combs unguarded, especially when they swarm three or\r\nfour times the same season. All swarms, after the first, sally forth to\r\navoid the battle of the Queens; constantly making a greater draft, in\r\nproportion to the number left, until the combs are partly exposed, which\r\ngives the miller free access to their edges.--The seeds of rapine and\r\nplunder are thus quickly sown, and soon vegetate, and fortify themselves\r\nby their silken fortress, before the bees are aware that their frontiers\r\nare invaded. While the moths are thus engaged in establishing their posts\r\non the frontiers of the bees, the latter are constantly and indefatigably\r\nengaged in providing themselves with another Queen, to supply the place of\r\nthe old one, which has departed with a swarm, and raising young bees to\r\nreplenish their reduced colony. Now as the moths have got possession of\r\nthe ground on their frontiers, it requires a tremendous effort on the part\r\nof the bees to save their little colony from a complete overthrow.\r\n\r\nIf late, or second and third swarms are always returned immediately,\r\naccording to the rule, the combs are kept so guarded that the moths are\r\ncompelled to keep their distance, or be stung to death before they can\r\naccomplish their purposes.\r\n\r\nHives made so large as not to swarm may lose their Queen, and then they\r\nwill abandon their habitation and emigrate into the adjoining hive,\r\nleaving all their stores to their owner, which, unless immediately taken\r\ncare of, the moths will not fail to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe moths are often complained of when they are not guilty. Hives are\r\nfrequently abandoned by their occupants, in consequence of the loss of\r\ntheir Queen, unnoticed by any observer, and before any thing is known of\r\ntheir fate, the hive is destitute of bees, and filled with moths.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1834, one of my neighbors had a very large hive that\r\nnever swarmed, which lost their Queen; and in the course of a few days the\r\nbees entirely vacated their tenement, and emigrated into an adjoining\r\nhive, leaving the whole of their stores, which amounted to 215 lbs. of\r\nhoney in the comb.\r\n\r\nNo young bees or moths were discovered in the hive. Instances of this kind\r\nfrequently occur, and the true cause is unknown, from inattention.\r\n\r\nThe Queen may be superannuated, or may become diseased in the breeding\r\nseason, so as to render her unfruitful; or she may die of old age. In\r\neither case, the colony will be lost, unless supplied with another Queen,\r\nas explained in remarks on Rule 8; for when the Queen becomes unfruitful\r\nby either of the foregoing causes, the bees are not apprized of the loss\r\nwhich will in future be sustained by them, until after the means of\r\nrepairing the same are gone beyond their reach. All the grubs may have\r\npassed the various stages of their transformation, or at least advanced so\r\nfar towards the perfect insect, that their nature cannot be changed to a\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is much more tenacious of life than any other bee, and may live\r\nto a great age. But one Queen exists in the same hive any great length of\r\ntime. When there are more than one, the peculiar sound of each, as\r\nexplained in remarks on Rule 2, is heard by the other, which always\r\nresults in a battle between them, or the issue of a swarm in the course of\r\na day or two.\r\n\r\nBees, when placed in a dark room in the upper part of the house, or some\r\nout-house, are easily cultivated a short time with little trouble, and are\r\nsometimes made profitable to their owner; but as they are liable to some\r\nof the same casualties as those kept in swarming hives, they cannot be as\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nLarge colonies never increase their stock in proportion to the swarming\r\ncolonies. There is but one female in a large colony, and they can do but\r\nlittle more in raising young bees than to keep their stock good by\r\nreplenishing them as fast as they die off or are destroyed by the birds,\r\nreptiles and insects, which are great admirers of them, and sometimes\r\nswallow them by dozens. Now if it requires five swarming colonies to be\r\nequal in number to the one first described, it is not difficult to imagine\r\nthat five times as many bees may be raised by the swarming colonies: for\r\none Queen will probably lay as many eggs as another.\r\n\r\nThe swarming hives are no more liable to be destroyed by the moth during\r\nthe swarming season, than others, if the hives are kept well replenished\r\nwith bees according to Rule 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE XI.\r\n\r\nON FEEDING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is found that a swarm need feeding, hitch on the feeder, well stored\r\nwith good honey, while the weather is warm in October.\r\n\r\nThe apiarian should use the same precaution in feeding, as directed in\r\nRule 4, to prevent robberies.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe best time to feed is in the fall, before cold weather commences. All\r\nhives should be weighed, and the weight marked on the hive before bees are\r\nhived in them. Then, by weighing a stock as soon as frost has killed the\r\nblossoms in the fall, the apiarian will be able to form a just estimate of\r\ntheir necessities.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are fed in the fall, they will carry up and deposit their food\r\nin such a manner as will be convenient for them in the winter. If feeding\r\nis neglected until cold weather the bees must be removed to a warm room,\r\nor dry cellar, and then they will carry up their food, generally, no\r\nfaster than they consume it.\r\n\r\nA feeder should be made like a box with five sides closed, leaving a part\r\nof the sixth side open, to admit the bees from their common entrance with\r\nits floor level, when hitched on the front of the hive. It should be of\r\nsufficient depth to lay in broad comb, filled with honey. If strained\r\nhoney without combs is used for feeding, a float, perforated with many\r\nholes, should be laid over the whole of the honey in the box, or feeder,\r\nso as to prevent any of the bees from drowning; and at the same time, this\r\nfloat should be so thin as to enable them to reach the honey. It should be\r\nmade so small that it will settle down as fast as the honey is removed by\r\nthe bees. As soon as warm weather commences in the spring, the feeder may\r\nbe used. Small drawers cannot be depended on as feeders, except in the\r\nspring and summer, unless they are kept so warm that the vapor of the bees\r\nwill not freeze in them. It would be extremely hazardous for the bees to\r\nenter a frosty drawer. They will sooner starve than attempt the\r\nexperiment. Drawers may be used without danger from robbers, but when the\r\nfeeder is used, robbers must be guarded against as directed in Rule 4.\r\n\r\nCare should be exercised, in fall-feeding, to supply them with good honey,\r\notherwise the colony may be lost before spring by disease. Poor honey may\r\nbe given them in the spring, at the time when they can obtain and provide\r\nthemselves with medicine, which they only best understand.\r\n\r\nSugar dissolved, or molasses, may be used in the spring to some advantage,\r\nbut ought not to be substituted for honey, when it can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBees sometimes die of starvation, with plenty of honey in the hive at the\r\nsame time. In cold weather they crowd together in a small compass in order\r\nto keep warm; and then their breath and vapor collect in frost, in all\r\nparts of the hive, except in the region they occupy. Now, unless the\r\nweather moderates, so as to thaw the ice, the bees will be compelled to\r\nremain where they are located until their stores are all consumed that are\r\nwithin their reach. One winter we had cold weather ninety-four days in\r\nsuccession, during which time the bees could not move from one part of the\r\nhive to another. I examined all my hives on the eighty-third day, and on\r\nthe ninetieth day I found four swarms dead. I immediately examined for the\r\ncause, which was as already stated. I then carried all my hives into a\r\nwarm room and thawed them, so that the bees could move. Some hives that I\r\nsupposed were dead, revived; some few swarms I found nearly destitute of\r\nstores, which I carried into the cellar, turned them bottom up, cut out a\r\nfew of the combs, so as to make room to lay in combs filled with honey,\r\nwhich served as good feeders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE XII.\r\n\r\nON WINTERING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the near approach of winter, as soon as the bees have receded from the\r\ndrawers and gone below, insert a slide, take out the drawers, and supply\r\ntheir places with empty ones, bottom up. Suspend the bottom board at least\r\none eighth of an inch below the lower edge of the hive, and open the\r\nventilator.--Clean off the bottom board as often as the weather changes\r\nfrom cold to warm. Close no doors upon them, unless they are kept in a\r\nspacious room, and in such a place that the breath and steam of the bees\r\nwill not freeze.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been practised by different individuals. Some have\r\nburied them in the ground, others kept them in the cellar, chamber, &c.\r\nOne course only will be observed in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE XIII.\r\n\r\nON TRANSFERRING SWARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis operation should never be effected by compulsion.\r\n\r\nFIRST METHOD. Insert drawer No. 1 into the chamber of the hive, to be\r\ntransferred as early as the first of May. If the bees fill the drawer,\r\nthey will recede from the lower apartment and winter in the drawer. As\r\nearly in the spring as the bees carry in bread plentifully on their legs,\r\nremove the drawer, which will contain the principal part of the bees, to\r\nan empty hive. Now remove the old hive a few feet in front, and place the\r\nnew one containing the drawer where the old one stood. Now turn the old\r\nhive bottom up. If there are any bees left in the old hive, they will soon\r\nreturn and take possession of their new habitation.\r\n\r\nSECOND METHOD. Take drawer No. 1, well filled by any hive the same season,\r\ninsert the same into the chamber of the hive, to be transferred in\r\nSeptember, (August would be better.) If the bees need transferring, they\r\nwill repair to the drawer and make the same their winter quarters. Then\r\nproceed in the spring as directed in the first method.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThis management should excite a deep interest in every cultivator, both in\r\na temporal and moral point of view. Temporal, because the lives of all the\r\nbees are preserved; moral, because we are accountable to God for all our\r\nacts. We are not to be justified in taking the lives of animals or\r\ninsects, which are but lent blessings, unless some benefit to the owner\r\ncan be derived from their death, which will outweigh the evils resulting\r\nfrom such a sacrifice. Duty compels me to protest in the strongest terms\r\nand feelings, against the inhuman practice of taking the lives of the most\r\nindustrious and comforting insects to the wants of the human family by\r\nfire and brimstone.\r\n\r\nWhen bees have occupied one tenement for several years, the combs become\r\nthick and filthy, by being filled up with old bread and cocoons, made by\r\nthe young bees when transformed from a larva to the perfect fly.\r\n\r\nBees always wind themselves in their cells, in a silken cocoon, or shroud,\r\nto pass their torpid and defenceless (chrysalis) state.--These cocoons are\r\nvery thin, and are never removed by the bees. They are always cleaned\r\nimmediately after the escape of the young bees, and others are raised in\r\nthe same cells. Thus a number of bees are raised, which leaves an\r\nadditional cocoon as often as the transformation of one succeeds that of\r\nanother, which often occurs in the course of the season. Now in the course\r\nof a few years the cells become so contracted, in consequence of being\r\nthus filled up, that the bees come forth but mere dwarfs and sometimes\r\ncease to swarm. Combs are rendered useless by being filled up with old\r\nbread, which is never used except for feeding young bees. A greater\r\nquantity of this bread is stored up yearly than is used by them, and in a\r\nfew years they have but little room to perform their ordinary\r\nlabors.--Hence the necessity of transferring them, or the inhuman sentence\r\nof death must be passed upon them, not by being hung by the neck until\r\nthey are dead, but by being tortured to death by fire and brimstone.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to every cultivator that old stocks should be transferred. I\r\nhave repeatedly transferred them in the most approved manner, by means of\r\nan apparatus constructed for that purpose; but the operation always\r\nresulted in the loss of the colony afterwards, or a swarm which would have\r\ncome from them. When it is necessary to transfer a swarm, insert drawer\r\nNo. 1 into their chamber in the spring, say the first of May. If they till\r\nthe drawer, let it remain there; if they need to be changed to a new hive,\r\nthey will recede from the lower apartment and make the drawer their winter\r\nquarters, which should remain until warm weather has so far advanced as to\r\nafford them bread. Then they may be removed to an empty hive, as directed\r\nin the Rule. Now the drawer contains no bread, and should remain in the\r\nold stock until the bees can provide themselves with a sufficient quantity\r\nof that article to feed their young bees with; for bread is not collected\r\nearly enough and in sufficient quantities to feed their young as much as\r\nnature requires. If the bees fail in filling the drawer, one should be\r\nused that is filled by another swarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader might have expected many things demonstrated in this work,\r\nwhich are omitted by design.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the worker is too well understood by every owner of bees\r\nto need a particular description. So also of the drone; and the Queen has\r\nalready been sufficiently described to enable any one to select her out\r\nfrom among her subjects. If any further description is desired, the\r\nobserver can easily satisfy himself by the use of a microscope.--Every\r\nswarm of bees is composed of three classes or sorts, to wit: one Queen or\r\nfemale, drones or males, and neuters or workers. The Queen is the only\r\nfemale in the hive, and lays all the eggs from which all the young bees\r\nare raised to replenish their colony. She possesses no authority over\r\nthem, other than that of influence, which is derived from the fact that\r\nshe is the mother of all the bees; and they, being endowed with knowledge\r\nof the fact that they are wholly dependent on her to propagate their\r\nspecies, treat her with the greatest kindness, tenderness and reverence,\r\nand manifest at all times the most sincere attachment to her by feeding\r\nand guarding her from all danger.\r\n\r\nThe government of a hive is nearer republican than any other, because it\r\nis administered in exact accordance with their nature. It is their\r\npeculiar natural instinct, which prompts them in all their actions. The\r\nQueen has no more to do with the government of the hive than the other\r\nbees, unless influence may be called government. If she finds empty cells\r\nin the hive, during the breeding season, she will deposit eggs there,\r\nbecause it is her nature to do so; and the nature of the workers prompts\r\nthem so take care and nurse all the young larvae, labor and collect food\r\nfor their sustenance, guard and protect their habitations, and do and\r\nperform all things, in due obedience, not to the commands of the Queen,\r\nbut to their own peculiar instinct.\r\n\r\nThe drone is probably the male bee, notwithstanding the sexual union has\r\nnever been witnessed by any man; yet so many experiments have been tried,\r\nand observations made, that but little doubt can be entertained of its\r\ntruth. That the sexual intercourse takes place high in the air, is highly\r\nprobable from the fact, that other insects of the fly tribe do copulate in\r\nthe air, when on the wing, as I have repeatedly seen. That the drone is\r\nthe male bee, is probable from the fact that the drones are not all killed\r\nat once; but at least one in each hive is permitted to live several months\r\nafter the general massacre.\r\n\r\nI examined four swarms, whose colonies were strong and numerous, three\r\nmonths after the general massacre of the drones, and in three hives I\r\nfound one drone each; the other was probably overlooked, as the bees were\r\nthrown into the fire as fast as they were examined. But there are many\r\nmysterious things concerning them, and much might be written to little\r\npurpose; and as it is designed to go no further in illustrations than is\r\nnecessary to aid the apiarian in good management, many little speculations\r\nhave been entirely omitted in the work, and the reader is referred to the\r\nwritings of Thatcher, Bonner, and Huber, who are the most voluminous and\r\nextensive writers on bees within my knowledge.\r\n\r\nBees are creatures of habit, and the exercise of caution in managing them\r\nis required. A stock of bees should be placed where they are to stand\r\nthrough the season before they form habits of location, which will take\r\nplace soon after they commence their labors in the spring. They learn\r\ntheir home by the objects surrounding them in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe hive. Moving them, (unless they are carried beyond their knowledge,)\r\nis often fatal to them. The old bees forget their new location, and on\r\ntheir return, when collecting stores, they haze about where they formerly\r\nstood, sad perish. I have known some fine stocks ruined by moving them six\r\nfeet and from that to a mile and a half. It is better to move them before\r\nswarming than afterwards. The old bees only will be lost. As the young\r\nones are constantly hatching, their habits will be formed at the new\r\nstand, and the combs will not be as likely to become vacated, so as to\r\nafford opportunity to the moths to occupy any part of their ground.\r\n\r\nSwarms, when first hived, may be moved at pleasure without loss of bees,\r\nadmitting they are all in the hive; their habits will be formed in exact\r\nproportion to their labors.--The first bee that empties his sack and goes\r\nforth in search of food, is the one whose habits are first established. I\r\nhave observed many bees to cluster near the place where the hive stood,\r\nbut a few hours after hiving, and perish. Now if the swarm had been placed\r\nin the apiary, immediately after they were hived, the number of bees found\r\nthere would have been less.\r\n\r\nBees may be moved at pleasure at any season of the year, if they are\r\ncarried several miles, so as to be beyond their knowledge of country. They\r\nmay be carried long journeys by travelling nights only, and affording them\r\nopportunity to labor and collect food in the day time.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this part of bee-management is the only apology I can\r\nmake for dwelling so long on this point. I have known many to suffer\r\nserious losses in consequence of moving their bees after they were well\r\nsettled in their labors.\r\n\r\nBees should never be irritated, under any pretence whatever. They should\r\nbe treated with attention and kindness. They should be kept undisturbed by\r\ncattle and all other annoyances, so that they may be approached at any\r\ntime with safety.\r\n\r\nAn apiary should be so situated, that swarming may be observed, and at the\r\nsame time where the bees can obtain food easily, and in the greatest\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nIt has been a general practice to front bee-houses either to the east or\r\nsouth. This doctrine should be exploded with all other whims. Apiaries\r\nshould be so situated as to be convenient to their owner, as much as any\r\nother buildings.\r\n\r\nI have them front towards all the cardinal points, but can distinguish no\r\ndifference in their prosperity.\r\n\r\nYoung swarms should be scattered as much as convenient during the summer\r\nseason, at least eight feet apart. They should be set in a frame and so\r\ncovered as to exclude the sun and weather from the hive.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this branch of rural economy, in consequence of\r\nthe depredations of the moth, is so much neglected.--Notwithstanding, in\r\nsome parts of our country, the business of managing bees has been entirely\r\nabandoned for years, I am confident they may be cultivated in such a\r\nmanner as to render them more profitable to their owners, than any branch\r\nof agriculture, in proportion to the capital necessary to be invested in\r\ntheir stock. They are not taxable property, neither does it require a\r\nlarge land investment, nor fences; neither does it require the owner to\r\nlabor through the summer to support them through the winter.--Care is,\r\nindeed, necessary, but a child, or a superannuated person can perform most\r\nof the duties of an apiarian. The cobwebs must be kept away from the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the hive, and all other annoyances removed.\r\n\r\nThe management of bees is a delightful employment, and may be pursued with\r\nthe best success in cities and villages, as well as towns and country. It\r\nis a source of great amusement, as well as comfort and profit. They\r\ncollect honey and bread from most kinds of forest trees, as well as garden\r\nflowers, orchards, forests, and fields; all contribute to their wants, and\r\ntheir owner is gratified with a taste of the whole. Sweet mignonette\r\ncannot be too highly recommended.--This plant is easily cultivated by\r\ndrills in the garden, and is one of the finest and richest flowers in the\r\nworld from which the honey-bee can extract its food.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont hive is the only one I can use to much advantage or profit,\r\nand yet there are some other improvements, which are far superior to the\r\nold box. In the summer of 1834, I received in swarms and extra honey from\r\nmy best stock, thirty dollars; and from my poorest, fifteen dollars. My\r\nearly swarms afforded extra honey which was sold, amounting to from five\r\nto ten dollars each hive; and all ray late swarms which were doubled,\r\nstored a sufficient quantity of food to supply them through the following\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe rules in the foregoing work, perhaps, may be deemed, in some\r\ninstances, too particular; yet, in all cases, they will be found to be\r\nsafe and unfailing in their application, though liable to exceptions, such\r\nas are incident to all specific rules.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nON RULE FIRST.--The underside of the chamber floor should be planed\r\nsmooth; then scratched with a sharp scratch, so as to enable the bees to\r\nhold fast; otherwise they may fall suddenly upon the bottom board, which\r\nmay induce them to leave the hive and flee to the woods. That the inside\r\nof the hive should be made smooth, is evident from the fact, that comb\r\nadheres much more firmly to a smooth board than it doss to the small\r\nfibres or splinters which are left by the saw, and is less likely to drop.\r\nThese remarks were omitted in the work by mistake.\r\n\r\nRULE SECOND--ON SWARMING AND HIVING,--The Drawers should be turned, so as\r\nto let the bees into them at the time of hiving; unless the swarm is so\r\nsmall that they can locate in a drawer.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.--Bees commence making comb, where the whole colony have room to\r\nwork. Now if the bees can all get into the drawer, they will begin there;\r\nof course they will raise young bees and deposit bread in the drawer. If\r\nthe swarm is so large as to be unable to work in the drawer, there is no\r\ndanger of letting them in. At the same time there may be danger if they\r\nare prevented from entering, because they sometimes go off for want of\r\nroom in the lower apartment. I therefore, recommend letting the bees into\r\nthe drawers at the time of hiving them, in all cases, except when the\r\nswarms are small, then the rule should be strictly adhered to.\r\nNotwithstanding I have hived hundreds of swarms in eight years last past,\r\nand have not lost a single swarm by flight to the woods, yet I frequently\r\nhear of losses of this kind, which appears to render these remarks\r\nnecessary. My practice in hiving, is to get the bees into the hive as quick\r\nas possible, hang on the bottom board, fasten the same forward by means of\r\nthe button so as to prevent the escape of any of the bees, except through\r\nthe mouth of the hive; place the hive immediately where I intend it shall\r\nstand through the season. Let the bottom board down 3/8ths of an inch, on\r\nthe third day after swarming.\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON RULE 10.--Small swarms should have the Queens taken from them\r\nand the bees returned to the parent stock, so as to keep the old hive well\r\nreplenished with bees during the moth season; likewise to avoid the loss\r\nof the old stock by freezing in the winter. Too much swarming frequently\r\noccasions the loss of the old stock the winter following, because their\r\nnumbers are so reduced that the necessary animal heat cannot be kept up to\r\nprevent them from perishing by cold. There may be more than one queen in\r\nall swarms after the first[1], as in all cases when bees make one queen\r\nthey make a plurality of them, and if more than one is hatched at the time\r\nof swarming, in the confusion which takes place in the hive, during\r\nswarming, all the queens which are hatched will sally forth with the\r\nswarm; hence, in taking away queens, the bee master should look for them\r\nuntil the bees begin to return to the parent stock. Cut off a limb and\r\nshake the bees on a table to find the queens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [1] Large colonies sometimes loose their queen and have been\r\n      known to make more, in which case, in order to avoid the\r\n      conflict of the queens, they have been known to swarm out\r\n      several bushels of Bees.",
