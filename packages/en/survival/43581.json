presented\r\nto the public in 1906.\r\n\r\nSince that time, however, I have deemed it advisable, for various\r\nreasons, to incorporate all my data in one volume.\r\n\r\nI desire to acknowledge my indebtedness for help in my researches, to\r\nvarious works on Horticulture, and to many of my personal friends who\r\nhave given me valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nI trust that this work will prove of some interest, as I believe that it\r\ncontains a fairly comprehensive list of both the indigenous and\r\nnaturalized Fruits of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\n  GERRIT PARMILE WILDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE I\r\n\r\n  _Persea gratissima._\r\n\r\n  AVOCADO, PALTA OR ALLIGATOR PEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrown in the garden of Gerrit Wilder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--_Avocado._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE II\r\n\r\n  _Persea gratissima._\r\n\r\n  AVOCADO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis spreading evergreen tree is a native of Tropical America. In the\r\nHawaiian Islands, the first trees of its kind were said to have been\r\nplanted in Pauoa Valley, Oahu, by Don Marin. It attains a height of from\r\n10 to 40 feet, and is adverse to drought. Its leaves are\r\nelliptico-oblong, from 4 to 7 inches in length. The flowers are\r\ngreenish-yellow and downy. The fruit, which ripens from June until\r\nNovember, is a round or pear-shaped drupe, covered with a thin, rather\r\ntough skin, which is either green or purple in color. The flesh is\r\nyellow, firm and marrow-like, and has a delicious nutty flavor. The\r\nseed-cavity is generally large, containing one round or oblong seed,\r\ncovered by a thin, brown, parchment-like skin. The quality of the pear\r\nis judged, not only by its flavor, but by the presence or absence of\r\nstrings or fibre in the meat, and also by the quantity of flesh as\r\ncompared to the size of the seed. Innumerable variations as to size,\r\nshape, and quality have been produced from seedlings--some of which may\r\nbe seen in the accompanying illustration. The Avocado is easily\r\nreproduced by budding and grafting, and the best varieties may be\r\nobtained in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--_Avocado._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE III\r\n\r\n  _Persea gratissima._\r\n\r\n  GUATAMALA AVOCADO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis variety is a native of Mexico, and although known as the Guatamala\r\nAvocado, it is more commonly to be found in the markets of the City of\r\nMexico. Its leaves are purplish-green. The flowers, which appear in May\r\nand June, are like those of the preceding variety; and the drupe, which\r\nmatures in the early part of the year, has a long stem. This fruit is\r\nround, from 3 to 5 inches in diameter, has a thick, tough, rough rind,\r\nwhich when ripe is a deep claret color, and the meat, which is a\r\ngolden-yellow, is tinged with purple next to the rind, and is free from\r\nstrings or fibres. There are but two trees of this variety bearing fruit\r\nin Honolulu. They were propagated from seeds brought here in 1890 by\r\nAdmiral Beardsley. These two trees are growing in private gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.--_Guatamala Avocado._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE IV\r\n\r\n  _Punica Granatum._\r\n\r\n  POMEGRANATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name was derived from the word punicus, of Carthage, near which city\r\nit is said to have been discovered; hence malumpunicum, Apple of\r\nCarthage, which was the early name of the Pomegranate. It is a native of\r\nNorthern Africa, and of Southwestern Asia, and is grown in the Himalayas\r\nup to an elevation of 6000 feet. It is a deciduous shrub, which by\r\ncareful training can be made to grow into a tree from 10 to 15 feet\r\nhigh. Many shoots spring from the base of the tree, and should be cut\r\naway, as they draw the sap which should go to the fruit-bearing stems.\r\nThe branches are slender, twiggy, nearly cylindrical, and somewhat\r\nthorny. The bark contains about 32 per cent. tannin, and is used for\r\ndying the yellow Morocco leather. The peel of the fruit serves also as a\r\ndye. There are several varieties of Pomegranate growing in Hawaii: the\r\ndouble-flowering variety is popular as an ornamental plant. All of the\r\nvarieties are of easy culture, and are readily propagated by means of\r\ncuttings of the ripe wood. The leaves are lanceolate, glabrous, and a\r\nglossy-green with red veins. The flowers are axillary, solitary or in\r\nsmall clusters, and in color are a very showy rich orange-red. The fruit\r\nis about the size of an ordinary orange, has a persistent calyx, and is\r\nmade up of many small compartments arranged in two series, one above the\r\nother. The crisp, sweet, watery pink pulp enveloping each seed is the\r\nedible portion of the Pomegranate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--_Pomegranate._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE V\r\n\r\n  _Ficus Carica_ (common variety).\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fig is the most ancient, as well as one of the most valuable of all\r\nfruit trees. Its name is nearly the same in all European languages. The\r\ntree is supposed to be a native of Caria in Asia Minor. The intelligent\r\ncultivators of Anatolia, by whom the Smyrna Figs are produced, adhere to\r\nthe caprification process, used from time immemorial. In California,\r\nefforts have been made to test this process. In the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nthe Portuguese seem to be the most successful cultivators of the Fig,\r\nand several varieties are to be found throughout the group. This common\r\nvariety grows to a height of from 10 to 20 feet, is hardy, and can\r\neasily be propagated from cuttings. Its leaves are alternate, 3 to 5\r\ndeeply lobed, and are shed during the fall months, at which season\r\ncareful pruning will increase the following year's yield. The fruit is\r\nsingle, appearing from the axils of the leaves, on the new wood. It is a\r\nhollow, pear-shaped receptacle, containing many minute seeds, scattered\r\nthroughout a soft, pinkish-white pulp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--_Fig._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

In the Hawaiian Islands it confines\r\nitself almost entirely to the moist, shady valleys, and thrives well, up\r\nto an elevation of 1800 feet. It is generally gregarious, and on the\r\nnorth side of East Maui it forms a forest belt. It attains a height of\r\nfrom 25 to 50 feet. Its dark, shiny, glabrous leaves are opposite,\r\nelliptico-oblong, and from 6 to 7 inches long, and from 2½ to 3 inches\r\nbroad. The flowers are crimson, fluffy balls, appearing in March and\r\nApril, on the naked branches and upper trunk of the tree. The fruit,\r\nwhich ripens from July until December, generally contains one seed, is\r\nobovate, about 3 inches in diameter. The skin is so thin as to be barely\r\nperceptible, and the fruit is very easily bruised. In color, it is a\r\ndeep, rich crimson, shading into pink and white; the pulp is firm,\r\nwhite, and juicy, with a very agreeable flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.--_Mountain Apple._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The foliage is symmetrical,\r\nand its opposite, shiny leaves are broad, lanceolate, and\r\nobtusely-acuminate. The pure white flowers, which bloom from March until\r\nJune, are about ½-inch in diameter, and are produced in bunches on the\r\nnaked branches. The fruit, which is also produced in bunches, ripens in\r\nOctober. It is transversely oval in shape, about 1 to 1½ inches in\r\ndiameter at its largest end. It contains from 1 to 3 seeds. Even when\r\nquite ripe, the fruit remains pure white in color, and has a tart,\r\ninsipid flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.--_Water Apple._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The flowers are small, deep crimson, and appear on the\r\nbranches either singly or in bunches. The contrast between these\r\nbrilliant flowers and the fresh green leaves makes a very beautiful\r\nsight when the tree is in full bloom. The fruit, which ripens in July,\r\nappears in clusters; it is the same shape as that of the preceding\r\nvariety, but in color it is a bright scarlet. It contains from 1 to 3\r\nseeds, which are somewhat difficult to germinate. The fruit is crisp,\r\nwatery, and has a sub-acid flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.--_Water Apple._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It grows well in Hawaii,\r\nand is found at an elevation of 2000 feet. It is propagated from seed,\r\nas well as from cuttings of the ripe wood. The leaves are lanceolate,\r\nacuminate, thick and shiny. The large, fluffy flowers which appear from\r\nJanuary until April, are produced freely, and are a beautiful\r\ncreamy-white. The fruit is a somewhat compressed, globular shell,\r\nvarying in size from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and with a large cavity,\r\ncontaining generally one seed. This shell, which is the edible portion\r\nof the fruit, is a light creamy-yellow, with a tinge of pale-pink on one\r\nside; it requires from 2 to 2½ months to mature. It is firm, crisp, and\r\nhas a delicious flavor, somewhat resembling an apricot, and with a rose\r\nodor. The season for the fruit varies according to the elevation, but\r\ngenerally ends about August or September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.--_Rose Apple._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The\r\nblossoming season varies according to the location; however, the tree\r\ngenerally has flowers and fruit from July until December. The fruit is\r\nthe size of a cherry, is deep purple in color, and the persistent calyx\r\nis very prominent. The sweet pulp has a very agreeable flavor.\r\n\r\nProbably the first plants of this variety were brought here by Don\r\nMarin, about a century ago. Some fine trees may be found in Pauoa and\r\nMakiki valleys, and also in Nuuanu, in the garden which formerly\r\nbelonged to Dr. Hillebrand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.--_Brazilian Plum, or Spanish Cherry._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

In Polynesia it\r\ngrows well, up to an elevation of 5000 feet. It is a very common tree in\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands. Its leaves, which are from 4 to 6 inches long, and\r\nfrom 2 to 3 inches broad, are opposite, obtuse or shortly-acuminate. The\r\nflowers, which bloom in June, July and August, are white and quite\r\nfragrant, and are especially attractive to the honey-bee. The oblong\r\nfruit grows in large clusters, ripens from September until November, and\r\nvaries in size from a cherry to a pigeon's egg. It is purplish-black in\r\ncolor, and is edible only when thoroughly ripe. It contains one large,\r\noblong seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.--_Java Plum._\r\n\r\nOne half size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It bears but one crop a year,\r\nwill grow in any soil, and withstands dry weather. The foliage is\r\nsmaller than that of the preceding variety; its leaves are narrower, and\r\na lighter green in color. It blooms at about the same time of year, but\r\nits flowers are not as large, and appear in thick bunches. The purplish\r\nfruit ripens from September until December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.--_Java Plum._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It is evergreen, with dense foliage, and grows to a height of\r\nfrom 15 to 20 feet. It is easily propagated from seeds, and fruits in\r\nabout three years. In Hawaii it bears one crop annually, the flowers\r\nappearing in July and the fruit in November and December. The leaves are\r\nalternate, odd-pinnate. The flowers, which are borne in clusters on the\r\nnaked stems and branches, are minute, fragrant, and in color shading\r\nfrom a pale pink to a deep purplish-red. The fruit, varying in size from\r\na hen's egg to an orange, is ovate, and has five acutely-angled\r\nlongitudinal ribs. The fragrant, light-yellow skin is very thin, and the\r\npulp is watery; it contains a number of flat, brown seeds. This fruit is\r\nof two varieties: the sweet, which may be eaten raw, and the acid which\r\nis delicious when preserved. A very appetizing pickle may be made from\r\nthe half-ripe fruit of the acid variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.--_Averrhoa Carambola._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The bark\r\npossesses tonic properties, and from the juice chewing-gum is made. Its\r\nfoliage is dense, and the shiny leaves are thick, lance-oblong, entire,\r\nand clustered at the ends of the branches. The flowers, which are small,\r\nwhitish, and perfect, are borne on the rusty pubescent growths of the\r\nseason. The fruit, of which there are two varieties, the round and the\r\noblong, is about the size of a hen's egg. It has a rough skin, the color\r\nof a russet apple, beneath which is a firm, somewhat stringy, sweet\r\npulp, having the flavor of an apricot. This pulp is divided into 10 to\r\n12 compartments, and contains from 4 to 6 large, flat, smooth, black\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.--_Sapodilla, or Naseberry._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The first tree of its kind in Hawaii was\r\nplanted in 1884, at the Government Nursery, Honolulu. The seed came from\r\nSanta Barbara, California, where there grows today, a tree more than\r\neighty years old, and which still bears its fruit. It is a tall\r\nevergreen with irregular branches; its digitate leaves are dark and\r\nglossy. The trunk is ashen-grey, with warty excrescences. The fruit,\r\nwhich matures in April and May, is large, 1 to 4 inches in diameter; it\r\nis depressed-globular and somewhat ribbed, like a tomato; in color it is\r\na light-green, turning to a dull yellow when ripe, and it has a very\r\nthin skin. The pulp is yellow, resembling that of an over-ripe, and has\r\na melting, peach-like flavor. It contains from 1 to 3 large, oblong\r\nseeds, which are said to be deleterious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.--_White Sapota._\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It is a hardy\r\ntree, and has been known to bear fruit precociously even in the second\r\nyear after planting. If allowed to do so, the Peach will grow to a\r\nheight of about 15 feet; but it should be pruned annually, in order to\r\nsecure a good crop. Its leaves are lanceolate and coarsely serrate. The\r\nflowers are solitary, pink in color, and appear before the leaves. The\r\nfruit is soft and pubescent at maturity. The stone is deeply pitted and\r\nvery hard. There are two well-marked varieties, the cling-stone and the\r\nfree-stone.\r\n\r\nUlupalakua and Makawao, Maui, once had the reputation of growing\r\nfinely-flavored seedling peaches; however, many of these trees have been\r\ninjured by cattle, and others have been destroyed by root-fungus and\r\ninsect pests. In several localities in Hawaii good peaches have been\r\ngrown from imported varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.--_Peach._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It has\r\nlarge irregular spreading branches, grows to a height of from 10 to 25\r\nfeet, and has rather thick foliage. Propagation is ordinarily effected\r\nby seeds, which germinate readily, when fresh. It can also be grown from\r\ncuttings of the ripe wood. The tree derives its name from the words\r\n\"chrysos,\" gold, and \"phyllon,\" a leaf; referring to the golden-russet\r\ncolor of the underside of the beautiful, glossy green leaves. The small\r\nflowers, which appear from June until October, are solitary at the nodes\r\nor in fascicles. The fruit, which ripens in April, is round, about 3\r\ninches in diameter, has a smooth, tough rind, about 1-16th inch thick,\r\nwhich is a deep purple in color. A cross-section of the fruit shows the\r\nedible pulp with its numerous black seeds, and the star-shaped core,\r\nfrom which the fruit derives its common name of Star Apple. Unless the\r\nfruit is thoroughly ripe, its milky juice is remarkably astringent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.--_Star Apple._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

In Jamaica it is called the \"Damson\r\nPlum.\" Its small, single, white flowers are highly perfumed. The fruit,\r\nwhich matures from August until December, is small, ovoid-oblong, and\r\nwhen ripe is purplish-black; when bruised it emits a white, sticky\r\njuice. It contains one large seed. Specimens of this tree are to be\r\nfound growing in the grounds of the Queen's Hospital and at the\r\nGovernment Nursery, Honolulu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.--_Chrysophyllum monopyrenum._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is a large, spreading\r\nand graceful tree, reaching a height of from 30 to 50 feet. Its pinnate\r\nleaves are green and glossy; the leaflets are oval-oblong and opposite.\r\nThe foliage is shed from December until April. The flowers are\r\npaniculate, small, and greenish-white. The fruit, which ripens from\r\nNovember until April, is a fleshy drupe, oval in shape, from 1 to 3\r\ninches in diameter; it has a thin, smooth, golden-yellow skin, which has\r\na rather sour disagreeable odor. The fleshy pulp is light yellow, is\r\nmellow when quite ripe, and has a sub-acid delicious flavor, compared by\r\nsome to the pineapple. Within this pulp is embedded a 1 to 5 loculed,\r\nbony endocarp, which contains generally one seed. This endocarp is\r\ncovered with fibres which penetrate the pulp. The first Wi tree in\r\nHawaii was planted at the residence of Mr. John S.

In Jamaica it grows well, up to an elevation of 4000 feet. It is\r\na large, graceful tree, about 50 feet high, with spreading branches, and\r\nit is particularly beautiful when in fruit. The pinnate leaves are a\r\nclear green, the leaflets are ovate-lanceolate, and the golden-yellow\r\nfruit hangs in clusters. It ripens in September and October. The fruit\r\nis ovoid, about 1 inch long; it has a smooth skin, having a disagreeable\r\nodor. There is one large seed, which resembles the husk of a ground-nut.\r\nThis fruit is cooling and aromatic. To my knowledge there are but two\r\ntrees of this kind in bearing in the Hawaiian Islands, and these are\r\ngrowing in private grounds in Honolulu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII.--_Hog Plum._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

In Jamaica\r\nit thrives well, up to an elevation of 3000 feet. The tree attains a\r\nheight of from 30 to 40 feet, and the wood, which is beautifully\r\ngrained, is durable and well adapted to building purposes. Its leaves\r\nare rigid and leathery. The round seeds, varying in number from 1 to 4,\r\ngerminate freely, and the young plants are easily raised. The fruit is\r\nfrom 3 to 6 inches in diameter, is brown or russet color, and has a\r\nyellow pulp, which is sweet and aromatic. The outer rind, as well as the\r\npulp immediately surrounding the seeds, is very bitter. The fruit may be\r\neaten raw, and is very delicious when preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII.--_Mammee Apple._\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It is a native of the Indies, Egypt and\r\nArabia. The tree is never leafless, and the foliage is graceful,\r\npinnated and acacia like. It bears one crop a year, the season varying\r\nsomewhat according to the location and elevation. It yields a handsome,\r\nhard and close-grained furniture wood, which is yellowish-white, with\r\noccasional red streaks in it; the heart-wood is dark brownish-purple.\r\nThe pods are thick, linear, dark brown in color, and from 3 to 6 inches\r\nlong. The seeds vary in number. The pulp surrounding the seeds has a\r\npleasant acid flavor, and when made into syrup, forms the basis of a\r\ndelicious, cooling beverage. This pulp is called the fruit, while the\r\npod is spoken of as the shell. The Tamarind is propagated from both\r\nseeds and cuttings, and is undoubtedly one of the noblest of our\r\ntropical trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX.--_Tamarind._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The leaves, which are a light, glossy green on\r\nthe upper surface, are alternate, entire, elliptical and acute. The\r\nyellowish-white flowers are large. The fruit, which is either globular\r\nor oval, sometimes measures 10 inches in length. It has a hard rind,\r\ncovered with thorny warts or spines, and externally looks not unlike a\r\nbreadfruit. When ripe, it is brownish-yellow, and, when opened at its\r\nlower end, shows five longitudinal sections or cells, each containing\r\nfrom 1 to 4 seeds about the size of a pigeon's egg. The edible pulp\r\nsurrounding the seeds is firm and cream-colored. The Durion is\r\nremarkable for its combination of an absolutely delicious flavor and an\r\nabominably offensive odor.

The\r\nuse of coffee was known in Arabia long before it was introduced to\r\nEuropeans in the sixteenth century. The Dutch were the first to\r\nintroduce the plant to Europe. The Arabian Coffee-tree is low-growing,\r\nand bears one crop annually; its leaves are elliptico-oblong, acuminate,\r\ngenerally from 3 to 6 inches long, and are thin and shiny. The white\r\nflowers appear in clusters, and are very fragrant. The berries are\r\novoid, fleshy, and bright red. In this berry are found the two seeds,\r\nwhich constitute the coffee of commerce. The Coffee-tree was introduced\r\ninto Hawaii about 1823, by a Frenchman, who established a small\r\nplantation in Manoa Valley, Oahu. The tree is now well naturalized in\r\nthe woods of Kona, Hawaii, and elsewhere in the Islands, and flourishes\r\nup to an elevation of from 1000 to 2000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI.--_Arabian Coffee._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XXXII\r\n\r\n  _Coffea liberica._\r\n\r\n  LIBERIAN COFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species is a tall grower, is highly ornamental in foliage, and is a\r\nrich bearer. Its leaves are from 6 to 12 inches long. The white flowers\r\ncome in dense clusters, and are more robust and productive than are\r\nthose of the Arabica. The berries are nearly spherical, and in color are\r\na dull crimson. The pulp is large in proportion to the size of the\r\nseeds. Although this variety has not become popular in Hawaii, it is\r\nclaimed that it will grow at a much lower elevation than will the\r\nArabica, and the flavor is said to be very fine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII.--_Liberian Coffee._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XXXIII\r\n\r\n  _Clausena Wampi._\r\n\r\n  WAMPI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis odorous tree is a native of China. It is a symmetrical evergreen\r\nwith dense foliage. The light, mossy-green leaves are imparipinnate, the\r\nleaflets ovate-repand, and they are rough on the under surface. The\r\nflowers, which are borne in clusters, on the new wood, are small,\r\nyellow, and very fragrant. The fruit ripens from June until October; it\r\nis about the size of a gooseberry; the skin is yellowish-brown, shaded\r\nwith green. The pulp is sub-acid with a balsamic fragrance. It contains\r\none large seed about the size of a kernel of corn. There are two\r\nvarieties, the sweet and the sour; both may be eaten raw, and are very\r\nhighly prized by the Chinese. I know of but two trees of this kind in\r\nthe Hawaiian Islands; they are of the sour variety, and are growing in\r\nprivate gardens in Honolulu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIII.--_Wampi._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It stands partially erect, reaching a height of from 1½\r\nto 3 feet. Its pointed leaves, heart-shaped at the base, are very fuzzy.\r\nThe open, bell-shaped flowers are yellow in color. The fruit, which is\r\nabout the size of a cherry, is enclosed in a thin, yellow, paper-like\r\nhusk, which is quite hairy. When ripe, the fruit is yellow, and has a\r\ndelicious sub-acid pulp, filled with minute seeds. The Poha may be eaten\r\nraw, but is much more acceptable when made into jam or jelly. The dried\r\nfruit is said to be a substitute for yeast. In Hawaii, the Poha thrives\r\nbest in the cool elevations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIV.--_Cape Gooseberry._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XXXV\r\n\r\n  _Carica Papaya._\r\n\r\n  PAPAYA (fruit, female tree).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Papaya is a native of South America; it is found in Florida, and in\r\nmany parts of tropical America; it was early introduced into Hawaii,\r\ngrows and bears well in almost any locality. It is a small tree, with a\r\nhollow, branchless trunk; it is short-lived, and is suitable only to\r\nregions free from frost, and requires perfect drainage. There are two\r\nforms, the tall and the dwarf, but there are numerous variations as to\r\nshape and quality of the fruit. The soft green leaves, often measuring\r\ntwo feet across, are variously palmated, and have simple, long, hollow\r\nstems. The Papaya is usually dioceous; the fruit-bearing tree is called\r\nthe female; it is claimed that trees of both sexes should be planted\r\nnear each other, in order to ensure a good yield. The female flowers,\r\nwhich appear from the axils of the leaves, are yellowish-white, single,\r\nor two or three together.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Papaya ripens successively. It is either round or\r\noblong, and sometimes weighs eight pounds. The skin is thin, and is\r\nbright yellow when ripe. The firm, yellow pulp has a delicious flavor,\r\nand the milky juice contains a digestive principle similar to pepsin.\r\nThe seed cavity is large, and is filled with many small seeds which are\r\nenveloped in a loose, mucous coat, with a brittle, pitted testa. When\r\nfresh these seeds germinate readily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXV.--_Papaya_ (_fruit, female tree_).\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

Its flowers appear on long stems, are\r\nfunnel-shape, and have five lobes. The male tree sometimes produces\r\nfruit, and it is of large size and fine quality. A good example may be\r\nseen in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\nI know of no method whereby one can, by any selection of seeds, produce\r\nwith any degree of certainty, plants of either male or female variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVI.--_Papaya_ (_fruit, male tree_).\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It has\r\na soft, hollow trunk, and low, spreading branches. The leaves are deeply\r\nlobed, of a light green color on the upper side, and whitish-green\r\nunderneath. Flowers dioecious, yellowish-green, having five petals.\r\nFruit the size of a large olive, green, and ribbed with five white\r\nstripes, changing to yellow when ripe. The yellow pulp, containing\r\nnumerous seeds, has a strong pesin flavor that is quite agreeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVII.--_Carica quercifolia._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is well named\r\nHazara (meaning thousand of fruit), as it is one of the most prolific of\r\nthe citrus family, and both green and ripe fruit in great quantities may\r\nbe found on the same tree at almost any season of the year. The tree is\r\nof medium size, and the small, shiny leaves have short petioles. It is\r\ngenerally thornless. The flowers are white and fragrant. The round fruit\r\nis a deep yellow, and its smooth skin is very loosely attached. The pulp\r\nis also a deep yellow and contains many seeds, and the sour juice is\r\nvery plentiful. The tree is hardy and free from disease and scale.\r\nPropagation is by seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXVIII.--_Chinese Orange._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XXXIX\r\n\r\n  _Citrus Japonica._\r\n\r\n  KUMQUAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kumquat is a native of Cochin-China, and is also cultivated in\r\nJapan, Florida, and California. It is a low-growing bush or shrub,\r\nhaving smooth, angular branches, and in both the round and oval\r\nvarieties the dark foliage is dense and beautiful. It is a very prolific\r\nbearer. Its leaves are small, lanceolate, slightly serrate, pointed or\r\nblunt and wedge-shaped at the base. The small, white flowers come\r\nsolitary or in clusters, the fruit varies in size from a large\r\ngooseberry to that of a pigeon's egg, and is either ovate, oblong, or\r\nspherical. It is 5 to 6 celled, has very little pulp, and contains many\r\nseeds. The pulp is somewhat sour, especially in the round varieties; and\r\nthe smooth, thick, yellow rind is aromatic and sweet; the Kumquat is\r\ngenerally preserved whole, and those prepared by the Chinese are very\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\nThis ornamental citrus tree is not often seen in our gardens, for it is\r\nsubject to scale, and to the mealy bug, which destroy the flowers and\r\nstunt the fruit. The Kumquat comes true to seed, and may also be\r\npropagated by grafting and budding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXIX.--_Kumquat._\r\n\r\nTwo thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XL\r\n\r\n  _Citrus Nobilis._\r\n\r\n  MANDARIN ORANGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small tree or thornless shrub with its dense foliage is a native of\r\nCochin-China, and fine specimens of this tree, with its golden fruit in\r\nseason, can be found in many gardens about Honolulu, especially those of\r\nthe Chinese. Its leaves are lanceolate, its petioles short. Flowers are\r\nwhite and fragrant. The fruit is compressed-spherical, apex depressed, a\r\nridge about the stem. The thin peel is greenish-yellow, baggy, and\r\nseparates readily from the sections. Pulp generally dry, sweet, juice\r\nscant, fruit containing many seeds. The characteristic odor of the\r\nleaves, twigs and fruit of all varieties of the Mandarin orange is\r\neasily recognizable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XL.--_Mandarin Orange._\r\n\r\nTwo thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE XLI\r\n\r\n  _Citrus medica limetta._\r\n\r\n  LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small tree or bush thrives in Hawaii, and yields good crops. It\r\nrequires a sandy, rocky soil, and does well in the shaded valleys.\r\nHowever, it is attacked by scale pests and root fungus, and many\r\nvaluable trees are destroyed in this way. The dark green, shiny leaves\r\nare oval or elliptical, and emit an agreeable odor when bruised. The\r\nfragrant flowers are small, white, with an occasional tinge of pink. The\r\nfruit is small, varying in shape from round to elliptical. The light\r\nyellow skin is oily and very bitter, and the pulp is juicy and sour. The\r\npicture representing this fruit shows several varieties, forms and\r\nshapes: those on the left being the Mexican type, those on the upper\r\nright the Kusai lime, the latter much resembling a mandarin orange in\r\nshape, and has a loose skin, but the pulp is very juicy and exceedingly\r\nsour. This lime has become very popular in Hawaii, grows readily from\r\nseed, and produces true. To Mr. Henry Swinton is due the credit of\r\nintroducing this variety in 1885 from Kusai, or Strong's Island,\r\nMicronesia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLI.--_Lime._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The flowers are small and white. The medium-sized fruit\r\nis egg-shaped, ending in a nipple-like point. The thin, smooth skin is\r\naromatic. The juicy pulp is rich in citric acid. Many choice varieties\r\nof lemons have been introduced to Hawaii, but they have not thrived\r\nparticularly well, because of the scale and insect pests which so\r\ngreedily attack them; eternal vigilance is necessary in order to get the\r\nfruit matured; some very fine specimens, however, have been grown in\r\nKona, at an elevation of 1500 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII.--_Lemon._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

Being a strong, vigorous grower, it forms an\r\nexcellent stock upon which to graft the citrus varieties. The flower is\r\nwhite, with a reddish tint outside. The fruit is generally oval, and\r\ncontains many seeds. The pale yellow skin is rough and warty. The pulp\r\nis coarse-grained and very juicy. It comes true to seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIII.--_Rough-skin Lemon._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

Its young branches are pale\r\ngreen, angular and glabrous. The leaves are oblong, ovate and pointed,\r\nand the petioles are narrowly winged. Its flowers are white and very\r\nfragrant. This variety of orange, locally known as the Waialua orange,\r\nhas a bright yellow fruit, generally round, with a coarse, thick skin,\r\nvery juicy pulp, and numerous seeds; and was introduced by Vancouver and\r\nplanted in Hanalei valley, Kauai. It is now widely disseminated\r\nthroughout the group, and in Kona, Hawaii, grows exceptionally well.\r\nThis orange is said to produce true to seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIV.--_Waialua Orange._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is cultivated\r\nextensively in California, in which State the first trees of its kind\r\nwere planted; for this reason it is often called the Riverside Navel.\r\nThe fruit is large, solid, and heavy. It is seedless, and has a\r\nprominent navel mark at the apex. The brilliant orange color of the skin\r\nis one of its characteristics. Grafted and budded trees of this variety\r\nof orange may be found growing in many localities in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, but the fruit is not as fine as it should be, as, with few\r\nexceptions, it has a tendency to become very dry and woody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLV.--_Bahia, or Washington Navel Orange._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is extensively cultivated in India, and widely\r\ndistributed over the Malayan and Polynesian Islands. It was early\r\nintroduced to the Hawaiian Islands, presumably by the Chinese, who seem\r\nto be especially fond of the fruit, as it is always an important feature\r\nof their New Year's decorations. The leaves are large, oval or\r\novate-oblong, obtuse, and frequently emarginate, and the petiole is\r\nbroadly winged. The flowers are large and white. This pyriform variety,\r\nwhich is from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, often weighs 4 to 8 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe pale-yellow rind is smooth, thick and very bitter, but can be made\r\ninto a preserve. The pulp varies in color from pale yellow to red, and\r\nhas a sub-acid, slightly bitter, flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVI.--_Pomelo or Shaddock_ (_pear-shaped var._)\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

There they were\r\nplanted and thrived. At the present day this variety of the breadfruit,\r\nnow called the Hawaiian variety, is to be found growing wild throughout\r\nthe Islands. There are many varieties of this handsome tree, which grows\r\nto a height of from 15 to 40 feet. It thrives best in hot, moist places,\r\nand requires a great deal of water.\r\n\r\nIts large ovate leaves are rough and deeply lobed. The male flower is a\r\nlarge yellow catkin. The fruit is formed from the female flowers, and is\r\nattached to the branches by large stems. In shape it is either round or\r\noblong, varying in size from 5 to 8 inches in diameter. The thick, tough\r\nrind is, in some varieties muricated, and in others it is reticulated.\r\nIn color it is green, changing to brownish when the fruit is ripe. The\r\npulp is firm, mealy, and somewhat fibrous, and as an article of diet is\r\nmuch esteemed. Propagation is by suckers, or by layers from the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVIII.--_Breadfruit_ (_Hawaiian var._)--\"_Ulu._\"\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

Its\r\nlarge, oval leaves are leathery and rough, and less deeply lobed than\r\nare those of the Hawaiian variety. The round fruit has a characteristic\r\nraised ring where it is attached to the long stem. The yellowish-green\r\nrind is reticulated, and the orange-colored pulp is somewhat sticky when\r\ncooked, and is very sweet. This variety occasionally produces seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIX.--_Breadfruit_ (_Samoan var._)\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

The Jack fruit is a large,\r\nhandsome tree, with leaves from 4 to 6 inches in length, which on the\r\nold growth are obovate-oblong and on the young branches are narrow. The\r\noblong, irregular fruit, which varies in weight from 20 to 60 pounds, is\r\nborne on the trunk, as well as on the old branches. The green rind is\r\ncovered with small hexagonal knobs. The pulp when ripe has all\r\noverpowering odor and is seldom eaten; but the oily seeds when roasted\r\nare edible, and are said to resemble chestnuts. On Tantalus, Oahu, the\r\nJack fruit thrives well, and has produced fair sized fruits. It is a\r\ntree that needs a great deal of moisture, and consequently is seldom\r\ngrown on the low lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LII.--_Jack Fruit._\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

Its dark\r\ngreen, glabrous leaves are pointed, elliptical, and are shiny on the\r\nupper surface, but rusty beneath. The greenish-yellow flowers are\r\nusually solitary, and have a peculiar odor. The fruit is large, varying\r\nin weight from 1 to 15 pounds. In shape, it is either oblong or conical\r\nand blunt. The rough, dark green, shiny skin, which is irregular in\r\nthickness, is studded with fleshy spines. The soft, white, cotton-like\r\npulp is divided into sections, each containing a shiny, black seed,\r\nabout half an inch long. These are very readily propagated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LIII.--_Sour Sop._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

It is naturalized in Central America, is hardy in the\r\nmildest coast regions of Spain, and in Jamaica is cultivated up to an\r\nelevation of nearly 5000 feet. It thrives on the Florida Keys, and is\r\nalso grown to a limited extent in Southern California. The tree grows to\r\na height of from 10 to 20 feet; its branches are spreading, and the\r\ndark, shiny leaves are either ovate or oblong, and are sparsely hairy\r\nabove and velvety beneath.\r\n\r\nThe single petaled, velvety-green flowers are very fragrant. The fruit,\r\nwhich is about the size of a large orange, is heart-shaped and slightly\r\nflattened at the stem end. When ripe, the skin is a greyish-green, and\r\nis covered with slightly-raised semicircular markings. The white pulp,\r\nwhich is soft and rich, is divided into cells, each containing a black\r\nseed about the size of an ordinary bean. The Cherimoyer comes true to\r\nseed and bears in about three years. It is one of the most delicious\r\nfruits, and its delicate, slightly-acid flavor is very characteristic.\r\nThe Cherimoyer was one of the earliest fruits introduced to these\r\nIslands, and the best specimens of its kind are grown in Kona and Kau,\r\nHawaii, where it continues to propagate itself naturally from seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LIV.--_Cherimoyer._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is a native of the Antilles, and\r\nis a very popular tree in the West Indies. It thrives in Southern\r\nCalifornia. Its leaves, which are either lanceolate or oblong and\r\npointed, are glabrous above and rough beneath. In color they are light\r\ngreen and rather brittle, when bruised they emit a very unpleasant odor.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are three-petaled and are greenish or yellowish, with purple\r\nspots at the base. Artificial pollination will induce the flowers to set\r\nand produce better crops. The heart-shaped fruit is from 3 to 5 inches\r\nin diameter. The skin is smooth, with small depressions; when ripe, it\r\nis a pinkish-yellow and shading to a russet. Next to the skin the pulp\r\nis soft and creamy-yellow, while toward the center it is quite white.\r\nThe flavor is sweet and delicious. There are numerous smooth, black\r\nseeds. This fruit, like its cousin the Cherimoyer grows true to seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LV.--_Custard Apple._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

In Hawaii it has become thoroughly naturalized, and is one of\r\nthe most common trees; growing from the sea level up to about 1,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA hot, rather dry, climate, with well-drained soil suits it best. It is\r\nan evergreen, shady tree of quick growing habit, sometimes reaching a\r\nheight of 70 feet, and having a round, dense top. All parts of the mango\r\ntree have a resinous fragrance, that suggests turpentine. Its thick,\r\nshiny leaves are from 6 to 10 inches in length. The greenish, scented\r\nflowers are borne in large terminal panicles; and these are followed\r\nthree or four months later by the fruit, which is large and\r\nkidney-shaped, having a smooth, rather soft, pale-green skin, with tints\r\nof yellow and red. The large seed is nearly as long as the fruit, its\r\nshell is rough and fibrous, and the kernel is shaped like a bean. In the\r\ninferior varieties of mangoes the pulp is full of fibre and tastes\r\nstrongly of turpentine. There are numerous varieties of the mango\r\ncultivated in Hawaii; the fruit of which varies much in point of flavor,\r\njuiciness, as well as in the size and shape of the seed.\r\n\r\nWithin the past ten years improved varieties have been imported; notably\r\nthe Alphonse, Cambodiana, Pirie, and many others. These have thrived\r\nwell and have borne delicious fruit; from them many grafts have been\r\nmade and the finer grades of mangoes have been disseminated. Propagation\r\nis effected by seed, by grafting or inarching, and by budding. The mango\r\nas a rule does not come true to seed; also seedlings take much longer to\r\nfruit than do the grafted trees.\r\n\r\nThe illustration on the opposite page is that of the so-called common\r\nmango, which was brought to Hawaii from Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXIV.--_Mango._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The first and original tree, which was planted at\r\nthe Government Nursery, Honolulu, was brought from Jamaica by Joseph\r\nMarsden, Esq. This tree is a prolific bearer, and its seeds have been\r\nwidely distributed throughout these Islands.

It is a large herbaceous,\r\nslightly shrubby, plant of very easy growth, having immense,\r\ngracefully-arching, undivided leaves. There are numerous varieties, the\r\nfruit of which differs in shape, color and flavor.\r\n\r\nAs decorative plants in landscape gardening, few subjects equal the\r\nchoice species of the banana; and on account of its utility, combined\r\nwith its beauty, it is considered one of the most valuable of tropical\r\nproducts. Propagation is by off-shoots or suckers. When a stalk is cut,\r\nthe fruit of which has ripened, sprouts are put forth which in time bear\r\nfruit. The enormous flower stalk issues from the center of the crown of\r\nleaves, and curves over with its own weight.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are arranged in a dense terminal panicle; they alternate\r\nwith large, reddish scales, which drop off as the fruit stalk develops,\r\nand the finger-like fruits are in clusters. The Hawaiians seem to have\r\npossessed the banana from the earliest times, and about fifty varieties\r\nwere known to the older natives. However, since the year 1855, the\r\nso-called Chinese banana (_Musa Cavendishii_), which was at that time\r\nintroduced from Tahiti, has crowded out the native varieties, many of\r\nwhich are now extinct.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut shows a few of the different forms and sizes of the\r\nbanana grown in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXVII.--_Banana_--\"_Maia._\"\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.\r\n\r\n  Moa          Largo\r\n  Popoulu      Red Cuban\r\n  Lele         Chinese]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It is a low evergreen tree with thick\r\nfoliage, and in congenial climates is a profuse bearer. Its leaves are\r\nthick, oblong, and remotely toothed and grow near the ends of the\r\nbranches. The white flowers grow in clusters, are very fragrant, and the\r\nfruit, which also ripens in clusters, about Christmas time, is\r\npear-shaped, and has an agreeable acid flavor. The seeds are large, and\r\ngerminate readily. Fine grafted and budded varieties have been\r\nintroduced by local horticulturalists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXXV.--_Loquat._\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

The\r\nfirst tree of this variety was brought to Hawaii by Mr. Afong, and\r\nplanted at his residence in Nuuanu avenue, Honolulu, in the year 1870.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are alternate, and abruptly pinnate; the oblong leaflets are\r\nnot quite opposite. Flowers pale green, small and regular, producing\r\nbunches of reddish-colored fruits, each about the size of a small\r\nwalnut. They are covered with a parchment-like skin having many soft\r\nspines. The interior consists of a large seed covered with a whitish\r\npulp of a sweetish acid flavor; this pulp when dried in the shell\r\nbecomes somewhat shriveled, brownish in color, and very sweet.\r\n\r\nThe fruiting season is in July, and as there are but few trees here that\r\nbear, high prices are obtained for this rare fruit, which is much prized\r\nby the Chinese. Fresh seeds will germinate, but it requires so many\r\nyears for these seedlings to bear that grafted and budded plants are\r\nimported from China.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXXVI.--\"_Lichee._\"\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It produces its\r\nflowers and fruits at about the same time of year as does the Litchi,\r\nwhich it somewhat resembles, although its fruits are somewhat smaller\r\nand less palatable. The tree grows to a height of about 20 feet. It has\r\nlarge, alternate, pinnate leaves, and the oblong leaflets are not quite\r\nopposite; they are glossy on the upper surface, and a dusty-brown on the\r\nunderside. The small flowers come in terminal panicles; and the fruit,\r\nwhich is borne in clusters, has a thin, brittle, somewhat rough shell.\r\nThere is one large, smooth, hard seed; around which is a thin layer of\r\nsweetish, aromatic pulp.

It is of medium size, the stem rising to a height of about\r\n20 feet; and its branches coming out in regular order give the head of\r\nthe tree the form of a parabola. The leaves are about 8 inches long and\r\n4 inches broad at the middle; they are a beautiful green on the upper\r\nside and a delicate olive on the under side. The flowers resemble a\r\nsingle rose with dark-red petals. The fruit is round, about the size of\r\na small orange, and has a characteristic persistent calyx. The shell is\r\nat first green, and when ripe changes to purplish-brown marked with\r\nyellow spots. The Mangosteen is called the queen of fruits, and the tree\r\nupon which it is produced is most graceful and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThose who have tasted this fruit in its perfection declare it to be\r\nindescribably delicious. The Mangosteen must have a hot, moist, and\r\nfairly equable climate throughout the year.\r\n\r\nMany Mangosteen trees have been brought to Hawaii, and have received\r\nintelligent care, but they have not thrived well; and have eventually\r\ndied. Only two have ever produced fruit; one in the garden of Mr.\r\nFrancis Gay of Kauai, which bears its fruit annually, and the other tree\r\nat Lahaina, Maui, in the garden formerly the property of Mr. Harry\r\nTurton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXXIX.--_Mangosteen._\r\n\r\nTwo thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It has long, narrow, leathery leaves of a\r\nbright, glossy green. The flowers, which have four petals, appear at the\r\naxil of the leaves, and the fruit, which is about the size of a small\r\nquince, has a smooth, thin skin, which is yellow when ripe. The firm\r\npulp is golden yellow, very juicy, and sour, and the seeds are large.\r\nThis variety is common in the Islands, and has often been mistaken for\r\nthe Mangosteen. It ripens its fruit in October and November. This\r\nvariety has been used to inarch the garcina mangostana upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XC.--_Garcinia Xanthochymus._\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

Its fruits are\r\nedible, but not especially palatable. It is a small tree having terete\r\nbranches, and its opposite leaves are oblong-elliptical, dark-green\r\nabove and a lighter, somewhat glossy-green beneath. The petioles are\r\nshort. The axillary inflorescence comes in long, slender cymes, and the\r\nfive-petaled flowers are yellow. When ripe, the obovate fruit is a\r\npurplish-yellow, having usually two seeds, and but one seed when\r\nabortive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XCI.--_Bunchosia sp._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The bright red fruit\r\nis about the size of a cherry, and has a thin skin, and its acid pulp is\r\nused for jam and preserves. The seeds or stones are large, four-angled,\r\nand germinate readily; plants are also produced by cuttings. Though not\r\ncommon in these Islands, there are, however, a few specimens of this\r\nplant to be found in several of the private gardens of Honolulu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XCII.--_Barbados Cherry._\r\n\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

It\r\nhas large, pointed leaves, and the new growth is wine-colored. The\r\nflowers appear on the trunk and mature branches, and the fruit which\r\nfollows is about 8 to 12 inches long, and is called the pod; inside of\r\nthis pod are beans or seeds, from which the commercial product called\r\ncocoa is made, through a process of drying and curing. Chocolate is the\r\nterm used for the sweetened preparations of the roasted and ground\r\nbeans, with a large proportion of the original fat retained. Cocoa\r\npreparations are the same material in fine powder, sweetened and\r\nunsweetened, with a greater part of the fat extracted.\r\n\r\nCacao cultivation has never been successfully attempted in Hawaii.\r\nHowever, a few isolated trees can be found at Ahuimanu Ranch, Oahu,\r\nwhere they were planted by the Catholic brothers as an experiment some\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XCIII.--_Chocolate, Cocoa._\r\n\r\nOne fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G.

The stems are reddish, and the pale yellow flowers solitary. The\r\nleaves are palmate and of a light-green color. It is widely cultivated\r\nin the tropics, in Florida, and in Southern California; and also thrives\r\nin Hawaii.

It climbs to a\r\nheight of 12 or more feet, and its leaf stalks are often 3 feet long. It\r\nobtains nourishment from the tree upon which it attaches itself. Its\r\nleaves are huge and perforated. As the plant climbs, the stems emit\r\naerial roots, many of which never reach the ground. The fruit which has\r\nthe appearance of an elongated pine-cone, grows to a length of from 6 to\r\n12 inches, and is about 2½ inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe rind is composed of plates which may be detached when the fruit is\r\nquite ripe. It is green in color until it ripens, when there appears a\r\nslight tinge of yellow. The creamy-white pulp has a most delicious\r\nflavor, somewhat resembling the banana, and also like the pineapple. It\r\nrequires 18 months to mature the fruit.

The first tree\r\nof its kind was planted by Mr. Henry Davis in his grounds at Punahou.\r\nThe tree grows to a height of from 15 to 20 feet. The light-green,\r\nleathery leaves are oval and rough, its pink flowers have a peculiar,\r\nstrong fragrance. The fruit consists of two distinct parts; the\r\nheart-shaped nut or seed and the fleshy, pear-shaped receptacle to which\r\nit is attached. This receptacle is from 2 to 4 inches long, is either\r\nred or yellow, and is very juicy and astringent. The nut or seed is\r\nedible when roasted. It is much appreciated in the West Indies.

Its\r\nflowers grow on separate branches below the foliage. The fleshy, green\r\nfruit, which is borne in long clusters, is acid and astringent, but when\r\nmade into preserves or pickles is palatable. The root and seeds have\r\nmedicinal qualities.

Although\r\nnot cultivated to any extent, the Olive has been growing in Hawaii for\r\nmany years. However, it has fruited only in a few favorable localities,\r\nand nothing has ever been done to test its value commercially.\r\n\r\nThe tree thrives best in a warm, dry atmosphere, where the soil is rich\r\nand well drained. Long-continued droughts so detrimental to most plants\r\nwill affect the Olive but slightly. The tree requires judicious pruning\r\nimmediately after the fruit is gathered, when the sap is comparatively\r\nat rest. The small, thick leaves are lanceolate, opposite, and usually\r\nentire; they are dull green above and silvery beneath. The small white\r\nflowers, which come in panicles, are usually imperfect. The fruit is a\r\nsmall, ellipsoid drupe, which is bluish-black when ripe. Its oil is an\r\nimportant product. The Olive may be propagated from seeds, cuttings,\r\nlayers, suckers and pieces of the old stumps. The seeds require some\r\ntime to germinate, and the growth of the young plant is slow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE C.--_Olive._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W.

The neighborhood of the sea is considered\r\nunfavorable to their production, although they will luxuriate in saltish\r\nsoil and bear well when brackish water is used.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of dates exist, the fruit differing in shape, size and\r\ncolor. They will grow from seeds, although the superior varieties can be\r\ncontinued only from off-shoots of the root. These will commence to bear\r\nin five years. In Asia, the growers of the commercial date find it\r\nnecessary to pollinate artificially by hanging sprays of the male\r\nflowers in the branches of the fruit-bearing trees. There are no\r\nimported trees bearing in Hawaii, and although there are many date trees\r\nin Honolulu, artificial pollination would doubtless greatly increase the\r\nyield and the quality of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CX.--_The Date Palm._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXI\r\n\r\n  _Phoenix dactylifera._\r\n\r\n  DATE (red and yellow variety).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut shows fruit from two of the best date trees in\r\nHonolulu, and it is curious to note that both of them were grown from\r\nseeds taken from packages of dried dates purchased from a local grocer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXI.--_Date_ (_red and yellow var._)\r\n\r\nOne third natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXII\r\n\r\n  _Acrocomia sp._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis interesting palm is seldom seen in Hawaii; there being but two\r\nspecimens of its kind that have produced fruit in Honolulu. Its stem is\r\ncapitately thickened at the persistent bases of the armed petioles. The\r\nglaucous leaves are pari-pinnate with narrow, lanceolate, accuminate\r\nsegments, having a prominent mid-rib.\r\n\r\nThe inflorescence is simple and branching. The fruit is arranged similar\r\nto that of Cocos, each about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,\r\nsub-globose with a pointed apex. When ripe, it is a bright yellow, and\r\nits juicy, edible pulp has the flavor of apricots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXII.--_Acrocomia sp._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXIII\r\n\r\n  _Cocos nucifera._\r\n\r\n  COCOANUT PALM.\r\n\r\n  \"NIU.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original home of this widely-diffused tree is not positively known.\r\nSome writers say it is indigenous to the islands of the Indian Ocean;\r\nothers show that in all probability it is of American origin. On account\r\nof its buoyant husk and impervious shell, it was enabled to drift across\r\nthe oceans without losing its germinating power, and in this manner was\r\nwidely dispersed. It is strictly a tropical plant, and grows naturally\r\non the seashore, or in its immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nIt has pinnate leaves about 12 to 18 feet long, and the inflorescence\r\nfirst appears in a cylindrical sheath, which splits length-wise,\r\nexposing long sprays of male flowers, and near the base generally one\r\nfemale flower, which is much larger, and eventually develops into a\r\nfruit. The picture shows both forms of flowers, as well as a young nut,\r\nand also a mature cocoanut. Propagation is by means of the nut alone,\r\nwhich must be thoroughly ripe before planting. The outer husk must be\r\nleft on, germination taking place at the largest eye; sometimes two eyes\r\nmay sprout, and twin trees grow from these. Many varieties have been\r\nimported from islands of the Pacific, Ceylon, West Indies, and Central\r\nAmerica. The cocoanut is not raised in Hawaii for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXIII.--_Cocoanut Palm_--\"_Niu._\"\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXIV\r\n\r\n  _Cordia collococca._\r\n\r\n  CLAMMY CHERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis low tree, with its spreading branches, is a native of the West\r\nIndies, and is rarely met with in these Islands; there being but two\r\ntrees of its kind known to me, one growing at the Old Plantation,\r\nHonolulu, the other at Honouliuli Ranch, Oahu. The whitish branches are\r\nvery brittle. The leaves are obovate, oblong, glabrous above and shiny\r\nbeneath. The subsessile flowers are whiteish-purple. The fruit, which is\r\nhalf inch in diameter, is bluntly pointed and smooth. The fleshy pulp is\r\nsticky, and adheres to the single seed. This plant may be grown from\r\nseeds and from cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXIV.--_Clammy Cherry._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXV\r\n\r\n  _Flacourtia cataphracta._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tree, which is a native of the Malay Islands and China, was\r\nintroduced to Hawaii by Mr. Albert Jaeger. There is but one tree which\r\nhas borne fruit; this is growing at the Old Plantation, Honolulu, Oahu.\r\nThe tree, which is about 25 feet high, has dense foliage; the leaves are\r\nsmall, oblong, lanceolate, glabrous, having short petioles. Flowers very\r\nsmall, dioceous; the fruit about the size of a common grape, is purple\r\nwhen ripe, and has a pleasant sub-acid flavor. It contains a few flatish\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXV.--_Flacourtia cataphracta._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXVI\r\n\r\n  _Atalantia buxifolia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small tree of dwarfish habit is from tropical Asia. It is closely\r\nrelated to the orange, and has large thorns. Its simple leaves are\r\nalternate, coriaceous, emarginate, and from 1 to 1½ inches in length.\r\nThe petioles are short. The small, solitary flowers have five petals.\r\nThe berry is globose and three-quarters of an inch in diameter. When\r\nripe, it is a shiny black, and has a thick skin. The pulp has somewhat\r\nthe flavor of a lime, and the seeds are generally 1 to 5 in number. The\r\nonly specimens of this tree in Hawaii are growing in the garden of Mrs.\r\nFoster; they, presumably, were introduced by Dr. Hillebrand, as these\r\ngardens formerly belonged to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXVI.--_Atalantia buxifolia._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXVII\r\n\r\n  _Bumelia sp._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis large shrub is a native of India. Its alternate, entire, obovate\r\nleaves have short petioles; they are glabrous and are about 4 to 8\r\ninches in length. The small flowers are light pink. The small, globose\r\nfruits grow in bunches; these are purple when ripe, but are not edible.\r\nThe only tree of its kind in Honolulu is growing in the grounds of the\r\nQueen's Hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXVII.--_Bumelia sp._\r\n\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXVIII\r\n\r\n  _Ochrosia elliptica._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in the Pacific Islands, Malay Peninsula, Ceylon, and\r\nAustralia; and on account of its handsome scarlet fruit is cultivated as\r\nan ornament, as the fruit is not edible. The tree is a small evergreen,\r\nhaving alternate, glabrous, coriaceous leaves which are crowded at the\r\nends of the stout branches. The small, white flowers have five petals.\r\nThe fruit consists usually of two, rarely one, spreading scarlet drupes,\r\neach containing a large seed. The first specimen of its kind in Hawaii\r\nwas planted at the Government Nursery, Honolulu, where it is still\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXVIII.--_Ochrosia elliptica._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXIX\r\n\r\n  _Ananas sativus._\r\n\r\n  PINEAPPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis variety of the pineapple plant was grown at an early date in these\r\nIslands, and until the new and spineless forms were introduced was the\r\nonly quality offered in the fruit markets. It is now cultivated but\r\nlittle, and is often found growing wild. The rosette at the head of the\r\nfleshy fruit has numerous thorny leaves. The fruit is much smaller than\r\nthose of the thornless varieties, but it has a very sweet flavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXIX.--_Pineapple._\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXX\r\n\r\n  _Opuntia Tuna._\r\n\r\n  PRICKLY PEAR--\"PANINI.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis erect, wide-spreading plant was early introduced to these Islands\r\nfrom Mexico. It thrives well in arid lands, and in times of drought its\r\nsucculent, fleshy leaves and juicy fruit are eaten by cattle. The\r\nplants, when old, become hard and woody, having many stout spines. The\r\nlarge flowers are reddish-yellow, and the obovate, truncate fruit is a\r\npurplish-red, having a thick fibrous skin, which is covered with fine\r\nbristles. The edible pulp is reddish-purple and contains numerous\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXX.--_Prickly Pear_--\"_Panini._\"\r\n\r\nOne half natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _G. P. W. Collection._      PLATE CXXI\r\n\r\n  _Prosopis juliflora._\r\n\r\n  ALGAROBA--\"KIAWE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kiawe deserves a special mention in this book, as it is, in my\r\nopinion, one of the most valuable and beautiful trees that grows in the\r\nHawaiian Islands. Perhaps on account of its very general dissemination,\r\nand because of the ease with which it spreads spontaneously, even in the\r\ndriest districts, it has received less consideration than has been\r\naccorded to other plants more difficult of propagation.\r\n\r\nThe Kiawe is the foundation of all the beauty of our lowlands, and\r\nprovides a delicate background for other plants. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances, it reaches to a height of 50 feet. It has wide-spreading\r\nbranches and delicate-green foliage. The flowers yield a delicious\r\nhoney, and the seed-pods furnish a valuable fodder, and, finally, when\r\nthe tree is cut down, its wood makes the very best of fuel. The Algaroba\r\nis a native of Central and South America. Ordinarily it is a\r\nmoderate-sized tree of quick and easy growth. Its branches in most cases\r\nare covered with stout, cylindrical, axillary spines, and in other cases\r\nthey are unarmed.\r\n\r\nThe abruptly bi-pinnate leaves have from 6 to 30 pairs of linear\r\nleaflets about one-fourth to one inch in length. The small, pale-yellow\r\nflowers come in cylindrical spikes. The straight or sickle-shaped\r\nseed-pod is sweet, and is eaten by stock. Propagation is by seed.\r\n\r\nThe first Algaroba tree of Hawaii was brought to Honolulu in 1828 by\r\nFather Bachelot, founder of the Roman Catholic Mission in the Islands.\r\nIt was planted in the Mission garden, where the venerable tree is\r\nstanding today.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE CXXI.--_Algaroba_--\"_Kiawe._\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed Transcriber's Notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes.\r\n\r\nThe relative size of items noted in the captions of the Plates relates\r\nto the original book, not to this document. Scaling of the images in\r\npreparation of this e-book and the size and resolution of the media on\r\nwhich the e-book is read make general statements about the relative\r\nsize of the pictured items impossible.\r\n\r\nThe \"Index\" was completely reworked so that it reflects the titles\r\nand captions within the body of the book. The original style was\r\nmaintained. Details of changes to the \"Index\" are omitted. The page\r\nnumber indicates the Plate, not the text preceding it.\r\n\r\nThe text of the book varies from the original in that obvious\r\nmisprints have been fixed. Where the intent of the misprint was not\r\nobvious, it has been left in place and noted below. Use of archaic and\r\nunusual words, spelling and styling has been maintained. Inconsistent\r\nhyphenation has been retained. Capitalization of botanical names is\r\nmaintained as in the original. Details of the changes follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetails of the Changes.\r\n\r\nFrequently used archaic spelling and styling which have been maintained:\r\nanona (annona), cocoanut (coconut), Guatamala (Guatemala) and Nuuanu\r\navenue (Nuuanu Avenue). Others occur less frequently.\r\n\r\nBoth the spellings preceding and preceeding were used throughout the\r\nbook. They have been standardized to preceding, as noted below.\r\n\r\nIn the caption of Plate III, to match the text title--changed to:\r\nGuatamala Avocado (in original book: Avocado).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate IV, changed to: elevation (in original book:\r\nelevtaion); and inserted period after the fruit-bearing stems.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate V, changed to: successful (in original book:\r\nssuccessful).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XI, changed to: preceding (in original book:\r\npreceeding).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XVII, changed to: soil (in original book: sosil);\r\nand to: preceding (in original book: preceeding).\r\n\r\nIn the text title with Plate XX, changed to: edulis (in original book:\r\neduiis).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XXII, for clarity, changed to: 1-16th (in\r\noriginal book: 1-16); and changed to: underside (in original book:\r\nunder-side) for consistency with elsewhere in the book.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XXIV, changed to: small (in original book:\r\nsamll).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XXXI, changed to: leaves (in original book:\r\nlaves) and changed to: who (in original book: whos).\r\n\r\nIn the text and captions associated with Plates XXXV through XXXVII, the\r\nspellings papaya and papaia were both used. They have been standardized\r\nto papaya.\r\n\r\nIn the caption of Plate XXXVI, moved the period (\".\") outside the\r\nparentheses, to match chapter heading.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XXXVII, the word pesin is probably a printing\r\nerror, however it is unclear whether the intended word was resin or\r\npepsin. The error has been left as in the original.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XXXVIII, changed to: generally (in original book:\r\ngeneraly).\r\n\r\nIn the caption of Plate XXXVIII, italicized Chinese Orange for\r\nconsistency with other caption formatting.\r\n\r\nIn the text title and caption of Plate XLI, changed to: lime (in\r\noriginal book: limes) for consistency with rest of the book.\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate XLV, changed to: WASHINGTON NAVEL\r\nORANGE (in original book: WASHINGTON NAVEL).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LVI, changed to: protuberance (in original book:\r\nportuberance).\r\n\r\nIn the text title and caption of Plate LVIII, changed to: Sweet Red\r\nGuava (in original book: Sweet red).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LVIII, changed to: preceding (in original book:\r\npreceeding).\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate LXIV, changed to: LXIV (in original\r\nbook: LXVI).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LXIV, changed to: followed (in original book:\r\nfolowed); and changed to: so-called (in original book: socalled) for\r\nconsistency with elsewhere in the book.\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate LXVII, changed to: varieties (in\r\noriginal book: varities); and in the text, changed to: center (in\r\noriginal book: centre) for consistency with the elsewhere in the book.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LXX, I suspect that 100 to 40 should have been\r\n10 to 40.\r\n\r\nIn the text and caption of Plate LXXII, changed to: candlenut (in\r\noriginal book: candle nut, candle-nut and candlenut) for consistency\r\nwithin this page.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LXXIX, changed to: preceding (in original book:\r\npreceeding).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LXXXVI, changed to: consists (in original book:\r\nconsistss).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate LXXXIX, changed to: parabola (in original book:\r\nparobola).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XCI, changed to: yellow (in original book:\r\nyelow).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate XCV, changed to: delicious (in original book:\r\ndeclicious).\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate XCIX, changed to: Phyllanthus (in\r\noriginal book: Phllanthus).\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate CII, changed to: Sinensis (in\r\noriginal book: Sinense).\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate CIII and in the caption:\r\nGranadilla Vine (in original book: Grenadilla).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate CIII, changed to: climber (in original book:\r\nclimer); and changed to: succulent (in original book: suculent).\r\n\r\nIn the caption of Plate CVIII, changed to: Night-blooming (in original\r\nbook: Night-Blooming) for consistency in caption formatting.\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate CX, changed to: considered (in original book:\r\nconsidereed); and changed to the archaic word: saltish (in original\r\nbook: satlish).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate CXIII, changed to: American (in original book:\r\nAmeriican).\r\n\r\nIn the title of the text with Plate CXIV, changed to: collococca (in\r\noriginal book: colloccoca).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate CXVII, changed to: Honolulu (in original book:\r\nHonolulue).\r\n\r\nIn the text with Plate CXVIII, changed to: where it is (in original\r\nbook: where is is).\r\n\r\nIn the caption of Plate CXIX, for consistency changed to: Pineapple (in\r\noriginal book: Pine apple).",
