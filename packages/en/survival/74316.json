A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this work it has been the purpose of the authors\r\nto present an outline of the salient features of geology, as now\r\ndeveloped, encumbered as little as possible by technicalities and\r\ndetails whose bearings on the general theme are unimportant. In common\r\nwith most writers of text-books on geology, the authors believe that\r\nthe subject is best approached by a study of the forces and processes\r\nnow in operation, and of the results which these forces and processes\r\nare now bringing about. Such study necessarily involves a consideration\r\nof the principles which govern the activities of geologic agencies.\r\nThese topics are presented in Volume I, and prepare the way for the\r\nstudy of the history of past ages, which is outlined in Volume II.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the work has been determined by the experience of\r\nthe authors as instructors. Little emphasis is laid on the commonly\r\nrecognized subdivisions of the science, such as _dynamic geology_,\r\n_stratigraphic geology_, _physiographic geology_, etc. The treatment\r\nproceeds rather from the point of view that the science is a unit, that\r\nits one theme is _the history of the earth_, and that the discussions\r\nof dynamic geology, physiographic geology, etc., apart from their\r\nhistorical bearing, lose much of their significance and interest.\r\nThe effort has, therefore, been to emphasize the historical element,\r\neven in the discussion of special themes, such as the work of rivers,\r\nthe work of snow and ice, and the origin and descent of rocks. This\r\ndoes not mean that phases of geology other than historical have\r\nbeen neglected, but it means that an effort has been made to give a\r\nhistorical cast to all phases of the subject, so far as the topics\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nThroughout the work the central purpose has been not merely to set\r\nforth the present status of knowledge, but to present it in such a way\r\nthat the student will be introduced to the methods and spirit of the\r\nscience, led to a sympathetic interest in its progress, and prepared to\r\nreceive intelligently, and to welcome cordially, its future advances.\r\nWhere practicable, the text has been so shaped that the student may\r\nfollow the steps which have led to present conclusions. To this end\r\nthe working methods of the practical geologist have been implied as\r\nfrequently as practicable. To this end also there has been frankness of\r\nstatement relative to the limitations of knowledge and the uncertainty\r\nof many tentative conclusions. In these and in other respects, the\r\npurpose has been to take the student into the fraternity of geologists,\r\nand to reveal to him the true state of the development of the science,\r\ngiving an accurate and proportionate view of the positive knowledge\r\nattained, of the problems yet unsolved, or but partially solved, and of\r\nsolutions still to be attained.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical and interpretative elements which enter into the\r\ngeneral conceptions of geology have been freely used, because they\r\nare regarded as an essential part of the evolution of the science,\r\nbecause they often help to clear and complete conceptions, and\r\nbecause they stimulate thought. The aim has been, however, to\r\ncharacterize hypothetical elements as such, and to avoid confusing the\r\ninterpretations based on hypothesis, with the statements of fact and\r\nestablished doctrines. Especial care has been taken to recognize the\r\nuncertain nature of prevalent interpretations when they are dependent\r\non unverified hypotheses, especially if this dependence is likely to be\r\noverlooked. If this shall seem to give prominence to the hypothetical\r\nelement, it should also be regarded as giving so much the more emphasis\r\nto that which is really trustworthy, in that it sets forth more frankly\r\nthat which is doubtful. Hypothetical and unsolved problems have been\r\ntreated, so far as practicable, on the multiple basis; that is,\r\nalternative hypotheses and alternative interpretations are frequently\r\npresented where knowledge does not warrant positive conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the topics discussed will be found to be presented in\r\nways differing widely from those which have become familiar. In some\r\ncases, fundamentally new conceptions of familiar subjects are involved;\r\nin others, topics not usually discussed in text-books are stated with\r\nsome fullness; and in still others, the emphasis is laid on points\r\nwhich have not commonly been brought into prominence. Whether the\r\nauthors have been wise in departing to this extent from beaten paths,\r\nthe users of the volumes must decide.\r\n\r\nThe work is intended primarily for mature students, and is designed to\r\nfurnish the basis for a year’s work in the later part of the college\r\ncourse. By judicious selection of material to be presented and omitted,\r\nthe volumes will be found useful for briefer courses, and by the use of\r\nthe numerous references to the fuller discussions of special treatises,\r\nthey may be made the basis for more extended courses than are commonly\r\ngiven in undergraduate work. The attempt has also been made to make the\r\nvolumes readable, in the belief that many persons not in colleges or\r\nuniversities will be interested in following a connected account of the\r\nearth’s history, and of the means by which that history is recorded and\r\nread. Antecedent elementary courses in geology will not be necessary to\r\nthe use of these volumes, though such courses may be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of themes adopted is such as to bring to the fore\r\nprocesses with which all students are immediately in contact, and\r\nwhich are available for study at all seats of learning. The commoner\r\ngeologic agents, such as the atmosphere and running water, have been\r\nelaborated somewhat more fully than is customary, and the common\r\nrather than the exceptional phases of the work of these agents have\r\nbeen emphasized, both because of their greater importance and their\r\nuniversal availability. The text has been so shaped as to suggest field\r\nwork in connection with these topics especially, since work of this\r\nsort is everywhere possible.\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary outline, which is intended to give some idea of\r\nthe scope of the science, and of its salient features, and to show the\r\nrelations of the special subjects which follow, the order of treatment\r\nis such as to pass from the commoner and more readily apprehended\r\nportions of the subject to those which are less readily accessible and\r\nmore obscure. Following the same general conception, the treatment of\r\nthe topics is somewhat graded, the earlier chapters being developed\r\nwith greater simplicity and fullness, while the later are somewhat more\r\ncondensed.\r\n\r\nMany acknowledgments are made in the text and foot-notes, but it\r\nis impossible to adequately acknowledge all the sources which have\r\nbeen drawn upon, since the whole body of literature has been laid\r\nunder contribution. The authors especially acknowledge the generous\r\nassistance of Professor J. P. Iddings in connection with the chapter on\r\nThe Origin and Descent of Rocks; of Dr. F. R. Moulton, Professor C. S.\r\nSlichter, Professor L. M. Hoskins, Mr. A. C. Lunn, and Mr. W. H. Emmons\r\nin connection with mathematical problems; of Professor C. R. Barnes in\r\nconnection with the geologic functions of life; and of Professor Julius\r\nStieglitz in connection with chemical subjects.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations have been selected from numerous sources, which are\r\nusually acknowledged in the text. Especial acknowledgment is due to the\r\nU. S. Geological Survey for the use of numerous photographs and maps,\r\nand to Mr. G. A. Johnson, who has made many of the drawings reproduced\r\nin Volume I. The authors are under even larger obligations for\r\nassistance in the preparation of Volume II, for which acknowledgment\r\nwill be made in the proper place.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Chicago, January, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                               VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                         PRELIMINARY OUTLINE.\r\n\r\n      Subdivisions, 1.

It also embraces the earlier expressions of mental\r\ndevelopment and of life-relationships, chiefly as found in the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n=Subdivisions.=—Naturally so broad a science has many special aspects\r\nwhich constitute subdivisions, in a sense, though they are rather\r\ndominant phases than independent sections. That phase which treats\r\nof the outer relations of the earth is _Cosmic_ or _Astronomic\r\ngeology_; that which treats of the constituent parts of the earth\r\nand its material is _Geognosy_, of which the most important branch\r\nis _Petrology_, the science of rocks. That branch which investigates\r\nthe structural arrangement of the material, or “the architecture of\r\nthe earth,” is _Geotectonic_, or _Structural geology_; while that\r\nwhich deals with the surface changes and topographic forms, that is,\r\nwith the face of the earth, is _Physiographic geology_. The study of\r\nthe fossils that have been preserved in the rocks, and of the faunas\r\nand floras that these imply, constitutes _Paleontologic geology_,\r\nor _Paleontology_. The treatment of the succession of events forms\r\n_Historical geology_. This is chiefly worked out by the succession\r\nof beds laid down in the progress of the ages, which constitutes\r\n_Stratigraphic geology_. The treatment of causes, agencies, and\r\nprocesses is the function of _Dynamic_ or _Philosophic geology_.\r\n\r\nBesides these there are special applications which give occasion\r\nfor other terms, as _Economic geology_, which is concerned with the\r\nindustrial applications of geologic knowledge; _Mining geology_, which\r\nis a sub-section of economic geology, relating to the application\r\nof geologic facts and principles to mining operations; _Atmospheric\r\ngeology_, _Glacial geology_, and others that define themselves, and are\r\nfor the greater part but limited aspects of the broad science.\r\n\r\n=Dominant processes.=—Three sets of processes, now in operation\r\non the surface of the lithosphere, have given rise to most of the\r\ndetails of its configuration, and even many of its larger features.\r\nThese processes have been designated _diastrophism_, _vulcanism_, and\r\n_gradation_. _Diastrophism_ includes all crustal movements, whether\r\nslow or rapid, gentle or violent, slight or extensive. Many parts of\r\nthe land, especially along coasts, are known to be slowly sinking\r\nrelative to the sea-level, while other parts are known to be rising.\r\nThe fact that rocks originally formed beneath the sea now exist at\r\ngreat elevations, and the further fact that areas which were once land\r\nare now beneath the sea, are sufficient evidence that similar changes\r\nhave taken place in the past. _Vulcanism_ includes all processes\r\nconnected with the extrusion of lava and other volcanic products,\r\nand with the rise of lava from lower to higher levels, even if not\r\nextruded. Vulcanism and diastrophism may be closely associated, for\r\nlocal movements at least are often associated with volcanic eruptions,\r\nand more considerable movements may be connected with the movements\r\nof subsurface lavas, even when the connection is not demonstrable.\r\n_Gradation_ includes all those processes which tend to bring the\r\nsurface of the lithosphere to a common level. Gradational processes\r\nbelong to two categories—those which level down, _degradation_, and\r\nthose which level up, _aggradation_. The transportation of material\r\nfrom the land, whether by rain, rivers, glaciers, waves, or winds,\r\nis _degradation_ and the deposition of material, whether on the land\r\nor in the sea, is _aggradation_. Degradation affects primarily the\r\nprotuberances of the lithosphere, while aggradation affects primarily\r\nits depressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         +Astronomic Geology.+\r\n\r\n=The earth as a planet.=—Though supremely important to us, the earth is\r\nbut one of the minor planets attendant upon the sun, and is in no very\r\nspecial way distinguished as a planetary body. Of the eight planets,\r\nfour, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are much larger than the\r\nearth, while three, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, are smaller. There are a\r\nhost of asteroids, but all together they do not equal the mass of the\r\nsmallest planet. The average mass of the eight planets is more than\r\nfifty times that of the earth, while the largest, Jupiter, is more than\r\nthree hundred times as massive as the earth. The earth’s position in\r\nthe group is in no sense distinguished. It is neither the outer nor the\r\ninner, nor even the middle planet. Even in the minor group to which it\r\nbelongs, it is neither the outermost nor the innermost member, though\r\nin this group it is the largest. Its average distance from the sun is\r\nabout 92.9 million miles, and this fixes its revolution at 365¼ days,\r\nfor its period of revolution is directly dependent on its distance from\r\nthe sun, and is necessarily longer than the revolutions of the inner\r\nplanets and shorter than those of the outer planets. Its rotation in\r\ntwenty-four hours is not far different from that of its neighbor Mars,\r\nbut is much slower than the more distant and larger planets, Jupiter\r\nand Saturn, which rotate in about ten hours. Comparison cannot be made\r\nwith the innermost and outermost planets, because their rotations are\r\nnot yet satisfactorily determined. The plane of the earth’s revolution\r\nlies near the common plane of the whole system, but this is not\r\npeculiar, as all of the planets revolve in nearly the same plane.\r\nOnly a few of the small asteroids depart notably from this common\r\nplane. This has an important bearing on theories of the origin of\r\nthe system, since this close coincidence of the planes of the orbits\r\nis not consistent with any haphazard aggregation of the material. Of\r\nsimilar importance is the fact that all of the planets revolve in\r\nthe same direction and in ellipses that do not depart widely from\r\ncircles. The eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is only about ¹⁄₆₀. This\r\neccentricity varies somewhat, due to the disturbing influences of the\r\nother planets, and this variation has been regarded by some geologists\r\nas an influential cause of climatic changes, but its adequacy to\r\nproduce great effects has been doubted by others. The inclination of\r\nthe earth’s axis, now about 23½°, holds an intermediate position, some\r\nof the planets having axes more inclined, as Saturn, 26⅚°, and others\r\nless inclined, as Jupiter, 3°. The inclination of the axis is subject\r\nto trivial variations at present, and in the long periods of the past\r\nhas possibly changed more notably. This possible change has also been\r\nthought to be a cause of climatic variation, but its efficiency has not\r\nbeen demonstrated.\r\n\r\n=Its satellite.=—The earth is peculiar in having one unusually large\r\nsatellite, which has a mass ¹⁄₈₁ of its own. The great planets have\r\nseveral satellites whose combined mass exceeds that of the moon, and\r\nperhaps in some few cases the individual satellites may be larger than\r\nthe moon, but they do not sustain so large a ratio to their planets,\r\nfor Titan, probably the largest, is only ¹⁄₄₆₀₀ of the mass of Saturn.\r\nThere is little doubt that the moon has played an important part in\r\nthe history of the earth. It is the chief agency in developing oceanic\r\ntides, and it possibly also develops a body tide in the earth itself.\r\nThese tides act as a brake on the rotation of the earth and tend to\r\nreduce its rate, and thereby to lengthen the day. While this may have\r\nbeen counteracted in some measure by the shrinkage of the earth, which\r\ntends to increase its rate of rotation, it has been held by eminent\r\nphysicists and geologists that the rotation of the earth has been\r\ngreatly lessened during its history, and that a long train of important\r\nconsequences has resulted. If the contraction of the earth has been\r\nsufficient to offset this lessening, the tidal brake must be credited\r\nwith the prevention of the excessive speed of rotation which would\r\notherwise have been developed. The tides are efficient agencies in the\r\nshore wear of the oceans, and in the distribution of marine sediments,\r\nand these, it will be seen later, are important elements in the\r\nformation of strata.\r\n\r\n=Dependence on the sun.=—By far the most important external relation\r\nof the earth, however, is its dependence on the sun. The earth is a\r\nmere satellite of the sun, less than ¹⁄₃₀₀₀₀₀ of its mass, and hence\r\nunder its full gravitative control. The earth is dependent on the sun\r\nfor nearly all its heat and light, and, through these, for nearly all\r\nof the activities that have given character to its history. It is\r\ntoo much to say that all activities on the surface of the earth are\r\nsolely dependent on those of the sun, for a certain measure of heat and\r\nlight and other energy is derived from other bodies, and a certain not\r\ninconsiderable source of energy is found in the interior of the earth\r\nitself; yet all of these are so far subordinate to that great flood of\r\nenergy which comes from the sun that they are quite inconsequential.\r\nThe history of the earth in the past has been intimately dependent upon\r\nthat of the sun, and its future is locked up with the destiny of that\r\ngreat luminary. Geology in its broadest phases can therefore scarcely\r\nbe separated from the study of the sun, but this falls within the\r\nfunction of the astronomer rather than the geologist.\r\n\r\n=Meteorites.=—There are a multitude of small bodies passing through\r\nspace in varying directions and with varying velocities and\r\noccasionally encountering the earth, to which they add their substance.\r\nSome of these meteorites revolve about the sun much as if they were\r\nminute planets, but some of them come from such directions and with\r\nsuch velocities as to show that they do not belong to the solar family.\r\nSome consist almost wholly of metal, chiefly iron alloyed with a\r\nsmall percent. of nickel (holosiderites); some consist of metal and\r\nrock intimately mixed (syssiderites and sporadosiderites); and some\r\nconsist wholly of rock (asiderites). The rock is usually composed of\r\nthe heavier basic minerals, though some meteorites consist largely\r\nof carbonaceous material. Besides meteorites, there is little doubt\r\nthat wandering gaseous particles strike the earth, but this is beyond\r\nthe reach of present demonstration. The amount of substance added to\r\nthe earth by these meteorites and gases in recent times is relatively\r\nslight compared with the whole body of the earth. What contribution may\r\nhave come to the earth in earlier times from such sources is a matter\r\nof hypothesis which will be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              +Geognosy.+\r\n\r\n=The constitution of the earth.=—Turning from its external relations to\r\nthe earth itself, a natural threefold division is presented: (1) the\r\natmosphere, (2) the hydrosphere, and (3) the lithosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _I. The Atmosphere._\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is an intimate mixture of (1) all those substances\r\nthat cannot take a liquid or solid state at the temperatures and\r\npressures which prevail at the earth’s surface, together with (2) such\r\ntransient vapors as the various substances of the earth throw off. The\r\nfirst class form the permanent gases of the atmosphere, and consist\r\nof nitrogen about 79 parts, oxygen about 21 parts, carbon dioxide\r\nabout .03 part, together with small quantities of argon, neon, xenon,\r\nkrypton, helium, and other rare constituents. The second class are\r\nthe transient and fluctuating constituents of the atmosphere, chief\r\namong which is aqueous vapor, which varies greatly in amount according\r\nto temperature, pressure, and other conditions. To this are to be\r\nadded volcanic emanations and a great variety of volatile organic\r\nsubstances. Theoretically, every substance, however solid, discharges\r\nparticles which may transiently become constituents of the atmosphere.\r\nPractically, only a few of these exist in such quantity as to be\r\nappreciable. Dust and other suspended matter are usually regarded as\r\nimpurities rather than constituents of the atmosphere, but they play a\r\nnot unimportant part by affecting its temperature and luminosity, and\r\nby facilitating the condensation of moisture.\r\n\r\n=Mass and extent.=—The total mass of the atmosphere is estimated at\r\nfive quadrillion tons, or ¹⁄₁₂₀₀₀₀₀ of the mass of the earth. It is\r\nrelatively dense at the surface of the earth and decreases in density\r\noutwards in a manner difficult of absolute determination, so that the\r\nactual height of the appreciable atmosphere is not positively known.\r\nThe true conception of the atmosphere is perhaps that of a tenuous\r\nenvelope exerting a pressure of about fifteen pounds per square inch\r\nat the sea-level, and thinning gradually upwards until it reaches a\r\ntenuity which is inappreciable, but perhaps not ceasing absolutely\r\nuntil the sphere of gravitative control of the earth is passed, about\r\n620,000 miles from the lithosphere. In the lower portion, according to\r\nthe kinetic theory of gases, the molecules fly to and fro, colliding\r\nwith each other with almost inconceivable frequency, and with very\r\nshort paths between successive collisions, but in the upper rare\r\nportion some of the molecules bound outwards, and do not strike other\r\nmolecules, and hence pursue long elliptical paths until the gravity of\r\nthe earth overcomes their momentum, when they return, perhaps to bound\r\noff again or to force other molecules to do so. This fountain-like\r\nnature of the outer part of the atmosphere makes any sharp definition\r\nof its limit impracticable. Some molecules are believed to be shot away\r\nat such speed that they do not return. Beyond about 620,000 miles from\r\nthe surface of the lithosphere, the differential attraction of the sun\r\nis greater than that of the earth, and if the attraction of the earth\r\ndoes not turn the molecules back before reaching this distance, they\r\nare almost certain to be lost to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of heights by the aneroid barometer, which is much used\r\nin practical geology, is dependent on the lessening of pressure as the\r\ninstrument is carried upward.\r\n\r\n=Geologic activity.=—The atmosphere is the most mobile and active\r\nof the three great subdivisions of the earth, and when its indirect\r\neffects through the agency of water, as well as its direct effects,\r\nare considered, it is to be regarded as one of the most effective\r\nagencies of change. It acts chemically upon the rock substance of the\r\nearth, causing induration in some instances, but more often inducing\r\ndisintegration and change of composition by means of which rock is\r\nreduced to soil, or soil-like material, and rendered susceptible of\r\neasy removal by winds and waters. When in motion the atmosphere acts\r\nmechanically on the surface of the earth, transporting dust and sand,\r\nand by the friction of these it abrades the surface. It is chiefly\r\neffective, however, in furnishing the conditions for water action.\r\nPartly by its mechanical aid, but chiefly by securing the right\r\ntemperature, it is a necessary factor in the action of rains, streams,\r\nglaciers, and the various forms of moving water upon land. So also,\r\non the ocean, wave action is essentially dependent on the winds. In\r\nthe absence of atmospheric propulsion, wave action would be chiefly\r\nconfined to the tides and to occasional earthquake impulses, and would\r\nlose nearly all its efficiency. Stream action and wave action, which\r\nare the most declared of the geological agencies, are therefore to be\r\ncredited as much to the atmosphere as to the hydrosphere, since the\r\naction is a joint one to which both envelopes are essential.\r\n\r\n=A thermal blanket.=—A function of the atmosphere of supreme importance\r\nis the thermal blanketing of the earth. In its absence the heat of\r\nthe sun would reach the surface with full intensity, and would be\r\nradiated back from the surface almost as rapidly as received, and only\r\na transient heating would result. During the night an intensity of cold\r\nwould intervene scarcely less severe than the temperature of space. In\r\npenetrating the atmosphere certain portions of the radiant energy of\r\nthe sun are absorbed. Of the remainder which reaches the surface of the\r\nearth, a part is transformed into vibrations of lower intensity, which\r\nare then more effectively retained by the atmosphere. The air thus\r\ndistributes and equalizes the temperature. The two constituents of the\r\natmosphere which are most efficient in this work are aqueous vapor and\r\ncarbon dioxide, and the climate of the earth is believed to have been\r\nvery greatly affected by the varying amounts of these constituents in\r\nthe atmosphere, as well as by the total mass of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe function of the atmosphere in sustaining life and promoting all\r\nthat depends on life is too obvious to need comment.\r\n\r\nThe special geological action of the atmosphere will be discussed in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _II. The Hydrosphere._\r\n\r\nAbout 1300 quadrillion tons of water lie upon the surface of the solid\r\nearth. This equals about ¹⁄₄₅₄₀ part of the earth’s mass. Were the\r\nsurface of the solid earth perfectly spheroidal, this would constitute\r\na universal ocean somewhat less than two miles deep. Owing to the\r\ninequalities of the rock surface, the water is chiefly gathered into a\r\nseries of great basins or troughs occupying about three-fourths (72%)\r\nof the earth’s surface. These basins are all connected with each other\r\nand act as a unit, so that anything which changes the level of the\r\nwater in one changes the level of all. This helps to make a common\r\nrecord of all great movements of the earth’s body, for the level of\r\nthe ocean determines where the detritus from the land shall lodge, and\r\nhence where the edge of the marine beds shall be formed. This will\r\nappear more clearly when the formation of marine strata is discussed.\r\n\r\n=Oceanic dimensions.=—The surface area of the ocean is estimated\r\nby Murray at 143,259,300 square miles. Of this, somewhat more than\r\n10,000,000 square miles lie on the continental shelf, i.e., lap up on\r\nthe borders of the continental platforms. This shows that the great\r\nbasins are somewhat more than full. If about 600 feet of the upper\r\npart of the ocean were removed, the true ocean basins would be just\r\nfull, and the surfaces of the true continental platforms would be dry\r\nland. The area of the true oceanic basins is about 133,000,000 square\r\nmiles, and that of the true continental platforms about 64,000,000\r\nsquare miles. Under about 20% of the ocean area, the bottom sinks to\r\ndepths between 6000 and 12,000 feet; under about 53% it sinks to depths\r\nbetween 12,000 and 18,000 feet; and under the remaining 4% it ranges\r\nfrom 18,000 feet down to about 30,000. The last includes those singular\r\nsunken areas known as “deeps,” and sometimes called _anti-plateaus_, as\r\nthey extend downward from the general ocean bottom much as the plateaus\r\nprotrude upwards from the general land surface.\r\n\r\nBesides the ocean, the hydrosphere includes all the water which\r\nconstitutes the surface streams and lakes, together with that which\r\npermeates the pores and fissures of the outer part of the solid earth;\r\nbut altogether these are small in amount compared with the great ocean\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n=Geologic activity.=—Of all geological agencies water is the most\r\nobvious and apparently the greatest, though its efficiency is\r\nconditioned upon the presence of the atmosphere, upon the relief of\r\nthe land, and upon the radiant energy of the sun. Through the agency\r\nof rainfall, of surface streams, of underground waters, and of wave\r\naction, the hydrosphere is constantly modifying the surface of the\r\nlithosphere, while at the same time it is bearing into the various\r\nbasins the wash of the land and depositing it in stratified beds. It\r\nthereby becomes the great agency for the degradation of the land and\r\nthe building up of the basin bottoms. It works upon the land partly\r\nby dissolving soluble portions of the rock substance, and partly by\r\nmechanical action. The solution of the soluble part usually loosens\r\nthe insoluble, and renders it an easy prey of the surface waters.\r\nThese transport the loosened material to the valleys and at length to\r\nthe great basins, meanwhile rolling and grinding it and thus reducing\r\nit to rounder forms and a finer state, until at length it reaches the\r\nstill waters or the low gradients of the basins and comes to rest.\r\nThe hydrosphere is therefore both destructive and constructive in its\r\naction. As the beds of sediment which it lays down follow one another\r\nin orderly succession, each later one lying above each earlier one,\r\nthey form a time record. And as relics of the life of each age become\r\nmore or less imbedded in these sediments, they furnish the means of\r\nfollowing the history of life from age to age. The historical record\r\nof geology is therefore very largely dependent upon the fact that the\r\nwaters have thus buried in systematic order the successive life of the\r\nages. Aside from this, the means of determining the order of events of\r\nthe earth’s history are limited and more or less uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe special processes of the hydrosphere in its various phases will\r\nbe the subject of discussion hereafter (Chaps. III, IV, VI). Suffice\r\nit here to recognize its great function in the constant degradation\r\nof the land, and in the deposition of the derived material in orderly\r\nsuccession in the basins.\r\n\r\n=Chief horizons of activity.=—The great horizons of geological activity\r\nare (1) the contact zone between the atmosphere and the hydrosphere,\r\nchiefly the surface of the ocean, (2) the contact zone between the\r\nhydrosphere and the lithosphere, chiefly the shore belts, and (3) the\r\ncontact zone of the atmosphere and surface waters, with the face of the\r\ncontinents. It is in these three zones that the greatest external work\r\nis being done and has been done in all the known ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _III. The Lithosphere._\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere and hydrosphere are rather envelopes or shells than true\r\nspheres, though in some degree both penetrate the lithosphere. The\r\nlithosphere, on the other hand, is a nearly perfect oblate spheroid\r\nwith a polar diameter of 7899.7 miles, and an equatorial diameter of\r\nabout 26.8 miles more. Its equatorial circumference is 24,902 miles,\r\nits meridional circumference 24,860 miles, its surface area 196,940,700\r\nsquare miles, its volume 260,000,000,000 cubic miles, and its average\r\nspecific gravity about 5.57. The oblateness of the spheroid is an\r\naccommodation to the rotation of the earth, the centrifugal force\r\nat the equator being sufficient to cause the specified amount of\r\nbulging there. Computations seem to indicate that the accommodation\r\nis very nearly what would take place if the earth were in a liquid\r\ncondition, from which the inference has been drawn that it must have\r\nbeen in that condition when it assumed this form, and must have\r\ncontinued essentially liquid until it attained its present rate of\r\nrotation, since, if the earth once rotated at a much higher speed, the\r\nflattening at the poles and the bulging at the equator must have been\r\ncorrespondingly greater. It is thought by others, however, that the\r\nplasticity of the earth is such that it would at all times assume a\r\nclose degree of approximation to the demands of rotation, even if the\r\ninterior were in a solid condition. By still others it is thought that\r\nthe contraction of the earth has tended to accelerate the rotation\r\nabout as much as the tides have tended to retard it, and that it has\r\nundergone little change of form.\r\n\r\n=Irregularities.=—It is only in a general view, however, that there is\r\na close approximation to a perfect spheroidal surface. In detail there\r\nare very notable variations from it. Geodetic surveys seem to have\r\nshown that the equatorial diameters are not all equal, even when the\r\nmeasurements are reduced to sea-level, but research along this line has\r\nnot reached a sufficient stage of completeness to permit satisfactory\r\ndiscussion. It is, however, highly probable that the ocean surface\r\nas well as the average land surface is warped out of the perfect\r\nspheroidal form to some notable degree. This is very likely due to\r\ninequalities in the density of the earth’s interior. The fact that the\r\nlarger portion of the water is gathered on one side of the globe, while\r\nthe land chiefly protrudes on the opposite side, is very possibly due\r\nto unequal specific gravity in the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious departure from a spheroidal form is found in the\r\nprotrusion of the continents and in the sinking away of the earth\r\nsurface under the oceans. As these inequalities present themselves\r\nto-day, they are known as continental platforms and ocean basins. These\r\ndo not correspond accurately with the present land and water surfaces.\r\nAbout the continental lands there is a submerged border extending some\r\ndistance out from the shore, and constituting a sea-shelf beyond which\r\nthe surface descends rapidly to the great depths of the ocean. This\r\nslightly submerged portion, known as the continental shelf, belongs\r\nas properly to the continent as the adjacent low lands which are not\r\nsubmerged. The submergence of the edge of this shelf at present is\r\nusually about 100 fathoms, so that if the upper 600 feet of the\r\nocean were removed, the outlines of the land would correspond quite\r\nclosely with the border of the true continental platform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =BATHYMETRICAL CHART OF THE OCEANS=\r\n\r\n  SHOWING THE “DEEPS” ACCORDING TO SIR JOHN MURRAY]\r\n\r\nIt is customary to look upon the protrusions of the continents as the\r\ngreat features of the earth’s surface, but in reality the oceanic\r\ndepressions are the master phenomena. In breadth, depth, and capacity\r\nthey much exceed the continental protrusions, and if the earth be\r\nregarded as a shrunken body, the settling of the ocean bottoms has\r\ndoubtless constituted its greatest surface movement. From the estimates\r\nof Murray, Gilbert has derived the following tables, showing the\r\nrelative areas of the lithosphere above, below, and between certain\r\nlevels.[1]\r\n\r\nFrom these estimates it appears that if the surface were graded to a\r\ncommon level by cutting away the continental platforms and dumping the\r\nmatter in the abysmal basins, the average plane would lie somewhere\r\nnear 9000 feet below the sea-level. The continental platform may\r\nbe conceived as rising from this common plane rather than from the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+----------------+--------------\r\n                                       |  Percent. of   |  Percent. of\r\n                 Contours.             |  Surface       |  Surface\r\n                                       |  above.        |  below.\r\n  -------------------------------------+----------------+--------------\r\n  Contour 24,000 feet above sea-level  |    0.004       |    99.996\r\n     „    18,000   „    „      „       |    0.09        |    99.91\r\n     „    12,000   „    „      „       |    0.7         |    99.3\r\n     „     6,000   „    „      „       |    2.3         |    97.7\r\n  Sea level                            |   27.7         |    72.3\r\n  Contour  6,000 feet below sea-level  |   42.5         |    57.5\r\n     „    12,000   „    „      „       |   57.3         |    42.7\r\n     „    18,000   „    „      „       |   96.8         |     3.2\r\n     „    24,000   „    „      „       |   99.93        |     0.07\r\n  -------------------------------------+----------------+--------------\r\n\r\n                                                            Percent.\r\n      More than 6000 feet above sea-level                      2.3\r\n      Between sea-level and 6000 feet above                   25.5\r\n      Between sea-level and 6000 feet below                   14.8\r\n      Between 6000 and 12,000 feet below sea-level            14.8\r\n      Between 12,000 and 18,000 feet below sea-level          39.4\r\n      Between 18,000 feet and 24,000 feet                      3.1\r\n\r\n=Epicontinental seas.=—Those shallow portions of the sea which lie\r\nupon the continental shelf, and those portions which extend into the\r\ninterior of the continent with like shallow depths, such as the Baltic\r\nSea and the Hudson Bay, may be called epicontinental seas, for they\r\nreally lie _upon_ the continent, or at least upon the continental\r\nplatform; while those other detached bodies of water which occupy deep\r\ndepressions in the surface are to be regarded as true abysmal seas,\r\nas, for example, the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas and the Gulf of\r\nMexico, whose bottoms are as profound as many parts of the true ocean\r\nbasin itself.\r\n\r\n=Diversities of surface.=—The bottoms of the oceanic basins are\r\ndiversified by broad undulations which range through many thousands\r\nof feet, but they are not carved into the diversified forms that give\r\nvariety to land surfaces. The ocean bottoms are also diversified by\r\nvolcanic peaks, many of which rise to the surface and constitute\r\nisolated islands. Some of them have notable platforms at or near the\r\nsurface, cut by the waves or built up by the accumulation of sediment\r\nand of coralline and other growths about them. Aside from these\r\nencircling platforms, the solid surface usually shelves rapidly down to\r\nabysmal depths, so that the islands constitute peaks whose heights and\r\nslopes would seem extraordinary if the ocean were removed.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the land is diversified in a similar way by broad\r\nundulations and volcanic peaks, and also by narrower wrinklings and\r\nfoldings of the crust; but all of these irregularities have been carved\r\ninto diversified and picturesque forms by subaërial erosion. In this\r\nrespect the surface of the land differs radically from the bed of the\r\nsea. The agencies which have produced the continental platforms and\r\nabysmal basins, and the great undulations and foldings, as well as the\r\nvolcanic extrusions that mark them, are yet subjects of debate. Here\r\nlie some of the most difficult problems of geology, but these cannot be\r\nstated with sufficient brevity to find a place here.\r\n\r\n=The surface mantle of the lithosphere.=—The surface of the lithosphere\r\nis very generally mantled by a layer of loose material composed of\r\nsoil, clay, sand, gravel, and broken rock. This loose material is\r\nsometimes known as _mantle rock_, and sometimes as _rock waste_. On\r\nthe land, mantle rock is often composed of the disintegrated products\r\nof underlying rock formations. It represents the results of the recent\r\naction of the atmosphere, of water, of changes of temperature, and of\r\nother physical agencies acting on the outer part of the rock sphere.\r\nThe surface of this mantle is being constantly removed by wind and\r\nwater, but as constantly renewed by continued decomposition of the rock\r\nbelow. In some areas, especially in the northern part of North America\r\nand the northwestern part of Europe, the soil graduates down into an\r\nirregular sheet of mixed clay, sand, gravel, and bowlders, known as\r\n_drift_. From this and other evidence it is inferred that at a time\r\nnot greatly antedating our own, ice, chiefly in the form of glaciers,\r\nspread extensively over the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\r\nIn some parts of the earth the surface is still covered by fields of\r\nsnow and ice, comparable to those which formed the drift. In still\r\nother places, especially along the flood plains of streams, the mantle\r\nrock consists of deposits made by streams which were unable to carry\r\ntheir loads of sediment to the sea.\r\n\r\n=The crust of the lithosphere.=—Much of the detritus washed down\r\nfrom the land finds its way to bodies of standing water, and beneath\r\nlakes and seas the mantle of loose material is made up largely of the\r\ngravel, sand, and mud derived from the land. Before deposition these\r\nmaterials are more or less assorted and arranged in layers by waves\r\nand currents. When consolidated they constitute rock. The weathering\r\nof the rocks of the land, the wearing away of the resulting detritus,\r\nand its deposition beneath standing water, are among the most important\r\nprocesses of geologic change.\r\n\r\nOn the land, the mantle of loose material is sometimes absent, and\r\nin such places the surface of solid rock of the crust appears. Bare\r\nsurfaces of rock are most commonly seen where the topography is rough,\r\nespecially on the slopes of steep-sided valleys and mountains, and on\r\nthe slopes of cliffs which face seas or lakes. Solid rock, without\r\ncovering of soil or loose material of any sort, is also frequently seen\r\nin the channels of streams, especially where there are falls or rapids.\r\n\r\nWe have but to note the effects of a vigorous shower on a steep slope,\r\nor of a swift stream on its channel, or of waves on the cliffs which\r\nface lakes and seas, to understand at least one of the reasons why\r\nloose materials are frequently absent from steep slopes. The very\r\ngeneral exposure of solid rock where conditions favor surface erosion\r\nsuggests that rock is everywhere present beneath the soil or subsoil.\r\nFortunately there is an easy way of testing the universality of the\r\ncrust beneath the mantle. In all lands inhabited by civilized peoples\r\nthere are numerous wells and other excavations ranging from a few feet\r\nto several hundred feet in depth, and occasional wells and mine-shafts\r\nreach depths of several thousand feet. Even in shallow excavations\r\nrock is often encountered, and in most regions excavations as much as\r\ntwo or three hundred feet deep usually reach rock, and no really deep\r\nboring has ever failed to find it. It may, therefore, be accepted as a\r\nfact that the upper surface of the solid rock is nowhere far below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nConcerning the thickness of the crust, if there be any true crust\r\nat all, little is known by direct observation. The deepest valleys,\r\nsuch as the canyon of the Colorado, and the shafts and borings of\r\nthe deepest mines and wells, give knowledge of nothing but rock. The\r\ndeepest excavations extend rarely more than a mile below the surface.\r\nIt is certain that rock of known kinds extends to far greater depths.\r\n\r\n=The interior.=—Concerning the great interior of the earth, little\r\nis known except by inference. From the weight of the earth,[2] it is\r\ninferred that its interior is much more dense than its surface. From\r\nits behavior under the attraction of other bodies, it is believed to\r\nbe at least as rigid as steel, and its interior cannot, therefore,\r\nbe liquid, in the usual sense of that term. From the phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes, and from observations on temperature in deep borings, it is\r\ninferred that its interior is very hot. Further inferences concerning\r\nits character are less simply stated, and will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nThe solid part of the earth is therefore composed of (1) a thin layer\r\nof unconsolidated or earthy material, a few feet to a few hundred feet\r\nin thickness, covering (2) a layer or zone many thousands of feet, and\r\nprobably many miles, thick, composed of solid rock comparable to that\r\nexposed at numerous points on the surface, and (3) a central mass, to\r\nwhich the preceding layers are but a shell, composed of hot, dense, and\r\nrigid rock, the real nature of which is not known by observation.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of rock in crust.=—If the mantle of soil, subsoil, and\r\nglacial rubbish were stripped from the land, the surface beneath would\r\nbe found to be made up of a great variety of rocks, all of which may be\r\ngrouped into two great classes. About four-fifths of the land surface\r\nwould be of rock arranged in layers, and the other fifth would be of\r\ncrystalline rock, generally without distinct stratification, and often\r\nbearing evidence of the effects of high temperature.\r\n\r\n=Stratified rocks.=—The composition of most stratified rocks\r\ncorresponds somewhat closely with the composition of sediments now\r\nbeing carried from the land and being deposited in the sea. Their\r\narrangement in layers is the same, and the markings on the surfaces\r\nof the layers, such as ripple-marks, rill-marks, wave-marks, etc.,\r\nare identical. Furthermore, the stratified rocks of the land, like\r\nthe recent sediments of the sea, frequently contain the shells and\r\nskeletons of animals, and sometimes the impressions of plants. Most of\r\nthe relics of life found in the stratified rocks belonged to animals\r\nor plants which lived in salt water. Because of their structure, their\r\ncomposition, their distinctive markings, and the remains of life which\r\nthey contain, it is confidently inferred that most of the stratified\r\nrocks which lie beneath the mantle rock of the land were originally\r\nlaid down in beds beneath the sea, and that the familiar processes of\r\nthe present time furnish the key to their history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 1.—Beds of (Cambrian) sandstone, _a_, are\r\n  conformable with one another, but unconformable on beds of (Huronian)\r\n  quartzite, _b_, Near Ableman, Wis.]\r\n\r\n=Conformability.=—When the stratified rocks exposed by the removal of\r\nthe mantle rock are examined, the successive beds are sometimes found\r\nto lie on one another in regular succession, showing that they were\r\nlaid down one after another, without change in the attitude of the\r\nsurface on which they were deposited. Such rocks are _conformable_\r\n(the beds of series _a_, Fig. 1). In other cases it would be seen that\r\ncertain beds overlie the worn surfaces of lower beds, the layers of\r\nwhich may have a different angle of inclination (series _a_, Fig. 1,\r\nis unconformable on series _b_). Such relations show that the lower\r\nseries of beds was disturbed and eroded before the overlying beds were\r\ndeposited on them. Such series of rocks are _unconformable_.\r\n\r\n=Relative ages.=—The structure and relations of rocks lead to\r\ninferences as to their relative ages. In the case of stratified\r\nrocks it is obvious that overlying beds were deposited later than\r\nthose below, and where there is unconformity it is evident that an\r\ninterval of time elapsed between the deposition of the unconformable\r\nseries. Another and in some respects more important means of telling\r\ntheir order of formation is found in the remains of life entrapped\r\nin the water-laid sediments. Whatever life existed in the waters\r\nin which the sediments were deposited was liable to burial, and if\r\nit was possessed of hard parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, hard\r\ninteguments, etc., these parts, or at least their impressions, were\r\nlikely to be preserved in the sediments. Even tracks and imprints of\r\nperishable parts are sometimes preserved. All these relics, which we\r\ncall _fossils_, give indications of the kinds of life which existed\r\nwhen the beds were formed. The fossils of the youngest beds show that\r\nthe life which existed when they were deposited was quite like that\r\nof the present time. The fossils of the next older and lower beds\r\nshow greater departure from present types. This series of changes\r\ncontinues downward as lower and lower beds are studied, until beds at\r\nconsiderable depths contain no relics of existing species but, in lieu\r\nthereof, forms of more primitive types. Some of these earlier types are\r\nclearly the ancestors of more modern forms, while others seem to have\r\nno living descendants. Going still deeper, the fossils indicate life of\r\nmore and more primitive types, until they depart very widely from the\r\nliving forms, and seem to be but remotely ancestral. So the beds may be\r\nfollowed downward until the lowest, which contain distinct evidences of\r\nlife, are reached.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that it is not possible to proceed directly\r\ndownward through the whole succession of bedded rocks, but that the\r\nedges of the various beds may be found here and there where they have\r\nbeen brought to the surface by warpings or tiltings, or exposed by\r\nthe wearing away of the beds which once overlay them. The full series\r\nof strata is made out only by putting together the data gathered\r\nthroughout all lands, and even when this is done an absolutely complete\r\nseries cannot yet be made out or, at least, has not been.\r\n\r\n=The crystalline rocks.=—The crystalline rocks which would appear\r\nif the mantle rock were removed are of two types, _igneous_ and\r\n_metamorphic_. Igneous rocks may be loosely defined as hardened lavas.\r\nMetamorphic rocks are those which are greatly changed from their\r\noriginal condition. Either stratified or igneous rocks may become\r\nmetamorphic.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks sustain various relations to the stratified rocks, as\r\nillustrated by Fig. 2. From these relations it is possible to tell\r\nsomething of the order of their formation. Where the stratified rocks\r\nare broken through by lavas, it is obvious that the stratified rocks\r\nwere formed first, and the lavas intruded later. Lava sheets intruded\r\nbetween beds of stratified rock can be told from those which flowed out\r\non the surface and were subsequently buried, for in the former case the\r\nsedimentary rocks, both above and below the igneous rock, were affected\r\nby the heat, while in the latter case only those below were so affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 2.—Diagrammatic representation of the relations\r\n  of igneous rock to stratified rock. The igneous rocks, represented in\r\n  black, have been forced up from beneath.]\r\n\r\nMore commonly than otherwise the metamorphic rocks (Fig. 3) lie beneath\r\nthe sedimentary beds and are often broken through by the igneous rocks.\r\nFrom their position in many places their great age may be inferred, but\r\nlocally, especially where dynamic action has been severe, relatively\r\nyoung rocks are metamorphic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 3. The figure represents a section of the\r\n  earth about 1000 miles long. The unequally thick black line at the\r\n  top represents on something like its proper scale the depth of the\r\n  stratified rock. The area below represents crystalline rock, largely\r\n  metamorphic.]\r\n\r\n=Four great sedimentary eras.=—The water-laid series represents four\r\ngreat eras in the history of the earth, as shown by the relics of life\r\nimbedded in them. Beginning with the latest, these are the _Cenozoic_\r\n(recent life), during which the life took on its modern aspect; the\r\n_Mesozoic_ (middle life), during which the life bore a mediæval aspect;\r\nthe _Paleozoic_ (ancient life), during which the life belonged to\r\nolder types; and the _Proterozoic_ (earlier life), during which it is\r\ninferred that much life prevailed, though its record is very imperfect.\r\nIt may safely be assumed to have been more primitive than that of the\r\nPaleozoic, as it was earlier. Each of these great divisions embraced\r\nseveral lesser periods or epochs, and these again are subdivided more\r\nand more closely according to the degrees of refinement to which\r\nstudies are carried. The chief of these subdivisions are given in the\r\ntable on page 19, and others will come under consideration in the\r\nhistorical chapters.\r\n\r\nIn these four great series of sedimentary rocks there are, here and\r\nthere, intrusions of igneous rocks, and in some places the sedimentary\r\nbeds have been metamorphosed into crystalline rocks by heat and\r\npressure. This is particularly true in the lowest of these series, the\r\nProterozoic, where a large part of the sediment is metamorphosed, and\r\nwhere there is much igneous rock, but it is still clear that the main\r\nportion of this series was originally water-laid sediment, and so it\r\nbelongs to the sedimentary series rather than the Archean, in which the\r\nsediments are the minor rather than the main factor. It has, however,\r\nusually been classed with the Archean, and it is certainly not always\r\neasy to draw the dividing line. In a sense it may be regarded as a\r\ntransition series.\r\n\r\n=The Archean complex.=—Beneath the dominantly sedimentary but partly\r\nmetamorphic and igneous series there is a very complex group of rocks\r\nlargely of metamorphosed igneous origin, though containing some\r\nmetamorphosed sediments. These extend downwards to unknown depths.\r\nWhile all the great formations are occasionally bent and broken, these\r\nlowest ones are almost everywhere warped, folded, and contorted, often\r\nin the most intricate way. They have been very generally mashed and\r\nsheared by enormous pressure, so that they have become foliated, and\r\ntheir original character is much masked. They therefore form a series\r\nof great obscurity and complexity. As they are at the bottom of the\r\nknown series, they have been called the “Fundamental gneiss” and the\r\n“Basement complex,” but as the part which we see is not the true base\r\nnor the true foundation, it is safer to call them simply the Archean\r\n(very ancient) complex. As life appears to have been present during\r\na part at least of the period of its formation is referred to the\r\nArcheozoic era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 4.—Diagram to illustrate the relations of the\r\n  five great groups of formations. _AR_ = Archean, _Pr_ = Proterozoic,\r\n  _P_ = Paleozoic, _M_ = Mesozoic, _C_ = Cenozoic.]\r\n\r\nBeyond and below this series, the structure of the earth is a matter\r\nof inference. Vast as are the preceding series, they together form\r\nrelatively but a thin shell on the outer surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing series are diagrammatically expressed in Fig. 4, and\r\nsystematically presented to the eye in the following table.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 GENERAL TABLE OF GEOLOGIC DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\n                  { Present.\r\n                  { Pleistocene.\r\n                  { Pliocene.\r\n  +Cenozoic+      { Miocene.\r\n                  { Oligocene.\r\n                  { Eocene.\r\n                  : Transition (Arapahoe  and Denver).\r\n                  { Upper Cretaceous.\r\n  +Mesozoic+      { Lower Cretaceous (Comanche or Shastan).\r\n                  { Jurassic.\r\n                  { Triassic.\r\n\r\n                  { Permian.\r\n                  { Coal Measures or Pennsylvanian.\r\n                  { Subcarboniferous, or Mississippian.\r\n  +Paleozoic+     { Devonian.\r\n                  { Silurian.\r\n                  { Ordovician.\r\n                  { Cambrian.\r\n\r\n                    Great interval.\r\n\r\n                  { Keweenawan.\r\n                  { Interval.\r\n  +Proterozoic+   { Animikean or Penokean.\r\n                  {   (Upper Huronian of some authors).\r\n                  { Interval.\r\n                  { Huronian.\r\n\r\n                    Great interval.\r\n\r\n                  {                  { Great Granitoid Series.\r\n                  {                  {   (Intrusive in the main,\r\n                  {                  {   Laurentian.)\r\n  +Archeozoic+    { Archean Complex. { Great Schist Series.\r\n                  {                  {   (Mona, Kitchi, Lower\r\n                  {                  {   Keewatin, Coutchiching,\r\n                  {                  {   Lower Huronian of some\r\n                  {                  {   authors.)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this general survey is to bring the salient features\r\nof the earth’s structure into view preparatory to entering in more\r\ndetail into the study of particular processes and special formations\r\nand to lay a foundation for the fuller apprehension of the successive\r\nstages of the history of the earth, which constitutes the chief purpose\r\nof geological study. It is now advisable to turn to the detailed\r\nconsideration of individual processes and specific structures. The\r\ncomplexity of the actions involved in the history of the earth is so\r\ngreat that such separate consideration at the outset is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                 THE ATMOSPHERE AS A GEOLOGICAL AGENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is convenient to regard the lithosphere as the earth proper,\r\nand the atmosphere as its envelope, the latter is as truly a part of\r\nthe planet as the former, and its activities and its history are as\r\ntruly subjects of geological study as the formation of the rocks. This\r\nview is in no way vitiated by the fact that the special study of the\r\natmosphere is set apart under the name _Meteorology_, for in the same\r\nway the special study of rocks is set apart under the name _Petrology_,\r\nthat of ancient life under the name _Paleontology_, and that of other\r\nphases of the subject under other names. The atmosphere is one of the\r\nthree great formations of the earth, and as a geological factor takes\r\nits place beside the hydrosphere and the lithosphere. It has played\r\na part in the history of the earth comparable to that of the water,\r\nthough its mass is less and its record more elusive. Unsubstantial as\r\nthe atmosphere seems when contrasted with the liquid and solid portions\r\nof the earth, its extreme mobility and its chemical activity compensate\r\nfor its lightness and tenuity, and give it a function of the first\r\norder of importance.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere plays a direct part as (1) a mechanical and (2) a\r\nchemical agent, and at the same time serves an indirect function\r\nin furnishing favorable conditions under which (3) solar radiation\r\nproduces temperature effects, and (4) evaporation gives origin\r\nto precipitation and stream effects, and furnishes the necessary\r\nconditions for land plants and animals, and the important influences\r\nthat spring from them.\r\n\r\nThis chapter is devoted to the work of the atmosphere in these and some\r\nless notable phases. The consideration of the origin and history of the\r\natmosphere will receive attention later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 A. THE ATMOSPHERE AS A DIRECT AGENCY.\r\n\r\n                         _I. Mechanical Work._\r\n\r\nThe mechanical work of the atmosphere is accomplished chiefly through\r\nits movement. A feeble breeze is competent to move particles of dust,\r\nand winds of moderate velocity to shift sand. Exceptionally strong\r\nwinds sometimes move small pebbles, but winds of sufficient force to\r\nmove larger pieces of rock are rare. It follows, therefore, that the\r\nimpact of the wind has little direct effect except on surfaces covered\r\nwith dust and dry sand.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of material by the wind is limited by the size\r\nof the particles to which it has access. Dust particles expose more\r\nsurface to the wind relative to their mass than sand grains. Winds\r\nwhich are unable to carry sand may still carry dust, and winds which\r\nare able to shift sand no more than a trivial distance may blow dust\r\ngreat distances.\r\n\r\nThe common conception of wind as a horizontal movement of some part\r\nof the atmosphere is not altogether accurate. Every obstacle against\r\nwhich wind blows causes deflections of its currents, and some of these\r\ndeflections are upward. Furthermore, there are exceptional winds,\r\nin which the vertical element predominates. Particles of dust are\r\noften involved in these upward currents, and by them carried to great\r\nheights, and in the upper air are transported great distances.\r\n\r\n=Transportation and deposition of dust.=[3]—The universality of the\r\ntransportation of dust by the wind is well known. No house, no room,\r\nand scarcely a drawer can be so tightly closed but that dust enters it,\r\nand the movements of dust in the open must be much more considerable.\r\nThe visible dustiness of the atmosphere in dry regions during\r\nwind-storms is adequate and familiar proof of the efficiency of the\r\nwind as a transporter of dust.\r\n\r\nUnder special circumstances, opportunity is afforded for rough\r\ndeterminations of the distance and height to which wind-blown dust is\r\ntransported. Snow taken from snow-fields in high mountain regions is\r\nfound to contain a small amount of earthy matter. Its particles are\r\noften found to be in part volcanic, even when the place whence the snow\r\nwas taken is scores or even hundreds of miles from the nearest volcano.\r\nThere is probably no snow-field so high, or so far from volcanoes, but\r\nthat volcanic dust reaches it. If this be true of all snow-fields,\r\nit is probably true of all land surfaces. In the great Krakatoa[4]\r\neruptions of 1883 large quantities of volcanic ash (pulverized lava)\r\nwere projected to great heights into the atmosphere. The coarser\r\nparticles soon settled; but, caught by the currents of the upper\r\natmosphere, many of the finer particles were transported incredible\r\ndistances. Through all their long journey, the particles of dust were\r\ngradually settling from the atmosphere, but not until the dust had\r\ntraveled repeatedly round the earth did its amount become so small as\r\nto cease to make its influence felt in the historic red sunsets which\r\nit occasioned.[5] Some of this dust completed the circuit of the earth\r\nin 15 days.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of Kansas and Nebraska[6] there are very considerable\r\nbeds of volcanic dust, locally as much as 30 feet thick, which must\r\nhave been transported from volcanic vents by the wind, though there\r\nare no known centers of volcanic action, past or present, within some\r\nhundreds of miles of some of the localities where the dust occurs.\r\nThese beds of volcanic dust, so far from its source, may serve as an\r\nillustration of the importance of atmospheric movements as a geological\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nVolcanic dust is shot into the atmosphere rather than picked up by\r\nit. Dust picked up by the wind is perhaps transported not less widely\r\nthan volcanic dust, but, after settling, its point of origin is less\r\nreadily determined. It would perhaps be an exaggeration to say that\r\nevery square mile of land surface contains particles of dust brought to\r\nit by the wind from every other square mile, but such a statement would\r\nprobably involve much less exaggeration than might at first be supposed.\r\n\r\nExamples of extensive deposits of dust other than volcanic are also\r\nknown. In China there is an extensive earthy formation, _the loess_,\r\nsometimes reaching 1,000 feet in thickness, which von Richtofen\r\nbelieves to have been deposited by the wind.[7] This conclusion has,\r\nhowever, not passed unchallenged.[8] The loess of some other regions\r\nhas been referred to the same origin, and some of it is quite certainly\r\neolian.[9]\r\n\r\nThe transportation of dust is important wherever strong winds blow over\r\ndry surfaces, free or nearly free of vegetation, and composed of earthy\r\nmatter. Its effects may be seen in such regions as the sage-brush\r\nplains of western North America. The roots of the sage-brush hold the\r\nsoil immediately about them, but between the clumps of brush, where\r\nthere is little other vegetation, the wind has often blown away the\r\nsoil to such an extent that each clump of brush stands up several\r\ninches, or even a foot or two, above its surroundings (Fig. 5). Such\r\nmounds are often partly due to the lodgment of dust about the bushes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 5.—This figure shows the effect of sage-brush or\r\n  other similar vegetation in holding sand or earth, or in causing its\r\n  lodgment, in dry regions.]\r\n\r\nWhere the earthy matter is moist, the cohesion of the particles is\r\ngreat, and the wind cannot pick them up. Furthermore, if the surface\r\nis generally moist, it is likely to be covered with vegetation which\r\nprotects it against the wind. But even where vegetation is prevalent\r\nthe wind finds many a vulnerable point. Thus on the edges of plains\r\nor plateaus facing abrupt valleys, the wind attacks the soil from\r\nthe side, and in such situations all earthy matter may be stripped\r\nfrom the underlying rock for considerable distances from the edge of\r\nthe cliff (Fig. 6). This may be seen at numerous points on the lava\r\nplateaus of Washington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 6.—Diagram to illustrate the way in which\r\n  the wind sometimes strips the soil from the edge of a bluff. This\r\n  phenomenon is not rare in the basin of the Columbia River in\r\n  Washington.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of dust in the upper atmosphere during a rain-storm is\r\nsometimes the occasion of phenomena which are often misinterpreted. If\r\nthere be abundant dust in the atmosphere through which rain-drops or\r\nsnowflakes fall, much of it is gathered up by them, and the water is\r\nthereby rendered turbid and the snow discolored. Here is to be found\r\nthe explanation of “mud-rain,” “blood-rain” (red dust), etc.\r\n\r\nSince dust is carried to a considerable extent in the upper atmosphere,\r\nits movements and its deposition are little affected by obstacles on\r\nthe surface of the land. A building or a hedge can only affect the\r\nlodgment of that part of the atmospheric dust which comes in contact\r\nwith it or is swept into its lee. Since most obstacles on the surface\r\nof the solid part of the earth reach up but slight distances into the\r\natmosphere, the dust of the greater part of the air settles without\r\nespecial reference to them, and is spread more or less uniformly over\r\nthe surface on which it falls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 7.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of an\r\n  obstacle on the transportation and deposition of sand. The direction of\r\n  the wind is indicated by the upper arrow. The lower arrows represent\r\n  the direction of eddies in the air occasioned by the obstacle. If the\r\n  surface in which the obstacle was set was originally flat (dotted\r\n  line), the sand would tend to be piled up on either side at a little\r\n  distance from the obstacle, but more to leeward. At the same time,\r\n  depressions would be hollowed out near the obstacle itself (see full\r\n  line). (After Cornish.)]\r\n\r\nMuch of the dust transported by the wind is carried out over seas or\r\nlakes and falls into them. By this means, sedimentation is doubtless\r\ngoing on at the bottom of the whole ocean, and at the bottoms of all\r\nlakes. While means of determining the amount of dust blown into the\r\nsea are not at hand, it is safe to say that, were such determinations\r\npossible, the result, if stated in terms of weight, would be surprising.\r\n\r\n=Transportation and deposition of sand.=—In its transportation by\r\nthe wind, sand is not commonly lifted far above the surface of the\r\nland, and its movement is therefore more generally interfered with by\r\nsurface obstacles than is the movement of dust. A shrub, a tree, a\r\nfence, a building, or even a stone may occasion the lodgment of sand\r\nin considerable quantity, though it has little effect on the lodgment\r\nof dust. The effect of obstacles is illustrated by Fig. 7 (see also\r\nFig. 5). If the obstacle which occasions the lodgment of sand presents\r\na surface which the wind cannot penetrate, such as a wall, sand is\r\ndropped abundantly on its windward side as well as on the leeward;\r\nbut if it be penetrable, like an open fence, the lodgment takes place\r\nchiefly on its leeward side. In cultivated regions cases are known\r\nwhere, in a few weeks of dry weather, sand has been drifted into lanes\r\nin the lee of hedges to the depth of two or three feet, making them\r\nnearly impassable to vehicles.\r\n\r\n=Formation of dunes.=—In contrast with dust deposited from the\r\natmosphere, wind-blown sand is commonly aggregated into mounds and\r\nridges in the process of lodgment. These mounds and ridges are dunes.\r\nOnce a dune is started, it occasions the further lodgment of sand, and\r\nis a cause of its own growth. Dunes sometimes reach heights of 200 or\r\n300 feet, but they are much more commonly no more than 10 or 20 feet in\r\nheight. On plane surfaces, there is a limit in height above which they\r\ndo not rise, though the limit is different under different conditions.\r\nThe velocity of wind at the bottom of the air is not so great as that\r\nhigher up, and as a dune is built up, a level is presently reached\r\nwhere the stronger upper winds sweep away as much sand as is brought to\r\nthe top. The very even crests of many dune ridges are probably to be\r\naccounted for in this way. Wind-blown or eolian sand, not piled up in\r\nheaps or ridges, is somewhat widespread, but does not constitute dunes.\r\n\r\n=Shapes of dunes.=[10]—Dunes may assume the form of ridges or of\r\nhillocks. The ridges may be transverse to the direction of the\r\nprevailing wind or parallel with it. Where dunes assume the form of\r\nhillocks rather than ridges, a group of them may be elongate in a\r\ndirection parallel to the dominant wind, or at right angles thereto.\r\nThe shape assumed by a dune or a group of dunes depends on the\r\nabundance of the sand, the strength and direction of the wind, and the\r\nshape of the obstacle which occasions the lodgment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 8.—Dune ridges parallel to the direction of\r\n  the wind. Southwest part of India. Scale about 3 miles to the inch.\r\n  (Cornish.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 9.—Dune ridges transverse to the direction of the\r\n  wind. Scale about 3 miles to the inch. (Cornish.)]\r\n\r\nThe incipient stages of dune formation are readily seen in many dry,\r\nsandy regions. The dune is likely to start in the lee of some obstacle,\r\nand to be elongate in the direction of the wind, especially if the wind\r\nbe strong relative to the supply of sand. This shape is permanently\r\npreserved if the proper relations between the supply of sand and\r\nstrength and direction of wind are preserved. In the dune region of the\r\nIndian desert[11] the prevailing winds are alternately the southwest\r\nand northeast monsoons, the former being the stronger. The supply\r\nof sand comes from the southwest. Near the southwest coast the dune\r\nridges are parallel to the direction of the wind (Fig. 8); in the\r\ninterior, where the winds are less strong, the dunes are transverse to\r\nit (Fig. 9); while between the districts where these two types prevail\r\nintermediate forms occur. The transverse dune ridges (Fig. 9) are said\r\nto be the result of the lateral growth and erosion of longitudinal\r\ndunes.[12] In regions of changeable winds the shape of the dunes\r\nis subject to great variation. Dunes are sometimes crescentic, the\r\nconvexity facing the wind (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 10.—Crescentic dunes in ground-plan, the\r\n  convexities facing the wind. (Bokhara.) (Walther.)]\r\n\r\nAlong coasts, dune ridges are often transverse to the wind, and groups\r\nof dune hillocks are frequently elongate in the same direction. Here\r\nthe source of supply of the sand is itself an elongate belt, often\r\ntransverse to the dominant wind, and the resulting dunes often have\r\ngreat length transverse to the wind. Where the wind has strong mastery\r\nover the sand, the longitudinal tendency is seen, even along coasts.[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 11.—Section of a dune showing, by the dotted\r\n  line, the steep leeward (_bc_) and gentler windward (_ab_) slope. By\r\n  reversal of the wind the cross-section may be altered to the form shown\r\n  by the line _adc_. (Cornish.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 12.—Cross-section of a dune showing the profiles\r\n  developed by scour of the wind on both flanks. (Cornish.)]\r\n\r\nThe shapes of dunes in section, like the shapes in ground-plan, depend\r\non the relative strength and constancy of the winds and the supply of\r\nsand. With constant winds and abundant drifting sand, dunes are steep\r\non the lee side (_bc_, Fig. 11), where the angle of slope is the angle\r\nof rest for the sand. It rarely exceeds 23° or 24°.[14] Under the same\r\nconditions the windward slope is relatively gentle (_ab_, Fig. 11).\r\nIf the winds be variable so that the windward slope of one period\r\nbecomes the leeward slope of another, and vice versa, this form is not\r\npreserved. Thus, by reversal of the wind, the section _abc_, Fig. 11,\r\nmay be changed to _adc_. If the winds and the supply of sand be equal,\r\non the average, from opposite directions, the slopes should, on the\r\naverage, be equal, though perhaps unequal after any particular storm.\r\nThe steep slopes of new-made dunes are lost after the sand has ceased\r\nto be blown. At some points where the winds erode (scour) more than\r\nthey deposit, new profiles are developed (Figs. 12 and 13). The erosion\r\nprofiles may be very irregular if the dunes are partially covered with\r\nvegetation. The effect of vegetation in restraining wind erosion is\r\nshown in Fig. 14, where plants have preserved a remnant of a dune.\r\n\r\n  =The topographic map.=—Since dunes as well as other topographic\r\n  features are conveniently represented on contour maps, and since\r\n  such maps will be used frequently in the following pages, a general\r\n  explanation of them is here introduced.\r\n\r\n  “The features represented on the topographic map are of three\r\n  distinct kinds: (1) inequalities of surface, called _relief_, as\r\n  plains, plateaus, valleys, hills, and mountains; (2) distribution\r\n  of water, called _drainage_, as streams, lakes, and swamps; (3) the\r\n  works of man, called _culture_, as roads, railroads, boundaries,\r\n  villages, and cities.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: +Fig.+ 13.—Diagram showing the outline of dunes in\r\n    process of destruction. Seven Mile Beach, N. J. (N. J. Geol.\r\n    Surv.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: +Fig.+ 14.—Illustrates the protective effect of\r\n    vegetation against wind erosion. Dune Park, Ind. (Cowles)]\r\n\r\n  =Relief.=—All elevations are measured from mean sea-level. The\r\n  heights of many points are accurately determined, and those\r\n  which are most important are given on the map in figures. It is\r\n  desirable, however, to give the elevation of all parts of the area\r\n  mapped, to delineate the horizontal outline, or contour, of all\r\n  slopes, and to indicate their grade or degree of steepness. This\r\n  is done by lines connecting points of equal elevation above mean\r\n  sea-level, the lines being drawn at regular vertical intervals.\r\n  These lines are called _contours_, and the uniform vertical space\r\n  between each two contours is called the _contour interval_. On\r\n  the maps of the United States Geological Survey the contours and\r\n  elevations are printed in brown (see Plate II).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: +Fig.+ 15.—Sketch and map of the same area to\r\n    illustrate the representation of topography by means of contour\r\n    lines (U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n  The manner in which contours express elevation, form, and grade is\r\n  shown in the following sketch and corresponding contour map, Fig.\r\n  15.\r\n\r\n  The sketch represents a river valley between two hills. In the\r\n  foreground is the sea, with a bay which is partly closed by a\r\n  hooked sand bar. On each side of the valley is a terrace. From\r\n  the terrace on the right a hill rises gradually, while from that\r\n  on the left the ground ascends steeply in a precipice. Contrasted\r\n  with this precipice is the gentle descent of the slope at the left.\r\n  In the map each of these features is indicated, directly beneath\r\n  its position in the sketch, by contours. The following explanation\r\n  may make clearer the manner in which contours delineate elevation,\r\n  form, and grade:\r\n\r\n  1. A contour indicates approximately a certain height above\r\n  sea-level. In this illustration the contour interval is 50 feet;\r\n  therefore the contours are drawn at 50, 100, 150, 200 feet, and\r\n  so on, above sea-level. Along the contour at 250 feet lie all\r\n  points of the surface 250 feet above sea; and similarly with any\r\n  other contour. In the space between any two contours are found\r\n  all elevations above the lower and below the higher contour. Thus\r\n  the contour at 150 feet falls just below the edge of the terrace,\r\n  while that at 200 feet lies above the terrace; therefore all points\r\n  on the terrace are shown to be more than 150 but less than 200\r\n  feet above sea. The summit of the higher hill is stated to be 670\r\n  feet above sea; accordingly the contour at 650 feet surrounds it.\r\n  In this illustration nearly all the contours are numbered. Where\r\n  this is not possible, certain contours—say every fifth one—are\r\n  accentuated and numbered; the heights of others may then be\r\n  ascertained by counting up or down from a numbered contour.\r\n\r\n  2. Contours define the forms of slopes. Since contours are\r\n  continuous horizontal lines conforming to the surface of the\r\n  ground, they wind smoothly about smooth surfaces, recede into\r\n  all reëntrant angles of ravines, and project in passing about\r\n  prominences. The relations of contour curves and angles to forms of\r\n  the landscape can be traced in the map and sketch.\r\n\r\n  3. Contours show the approximate grade of any slope. The vertical\r\n  space between two contours is the same, whether they lie along a\r\n  cliff or on a gentle slope; but to rise a given height on a gentle\r\n  slope one must go farther than on a steep slope, and therefore\r\n  contours are far apart on gentle slopes and near together on steep\r\n  ones.\r\n\r\n  For a flat or gently undulating country a small contour interval\r\n  is used; for a steep or mountainous country a large interval is\r\n  necessary. The smallest interval used on the atlas sheets of the\r\n  Geological Survey is 5 feet. This is used for regions like the\r\n  Mississippi delta and the Dismal Swamp. In mapping great mountain\r\n  masses, like those in Colorado, the interval may be 250 feet. For\r\n  intermediate relief contour intervals of 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100\r\n  feet are used.\r\n\r\n  =Drainage.=—Watercourses are indicated by blue lines. If the\r\n  streams flow the year round the line is drawn unbroken, but if the\r\n  channel is dry a part of the year the line is broken or dotted.\r\n  Where a stream sinks and reappears at the surface, the supposed\r\n  underground course is shown by a broken blue line. Lakes, marshes,\r\n  and other bodies of water are also shown in blue, by appropriate\r\n  conventional signs.\r\n\r\n  =Culture.=—The works of man, such as road, railroads, and towns,\r\n  together with boundaries of townships, counties and states, and\r\n  artificial details, are printed in black.”[15]\r\n\r\n=Topography of dune areas.=—From what has been said, it is clear that\r\nthe topography of dune regions may vary widely, but it is always\r\ndistinctive. Where the dunes take the form of ridges (Fig. 1, Pl.\r\nII), the ridges are often of essentially uniform height and width for\r\nconsiderable distances. If there are parallel ridges, they are often\r\nseparated by trough-like depressions. Where dunes assume the form of\r\nhillocks (Figs. 2 and 3, Pl. II), rather than ridges, the topography\r\nis even more distinctive. In some regions, depressions (basins) are\r\nassociated with the dune hillocks. Occasionally they are hardly less\r\nnotable than the dunes themselves. A somewhat similar association of\r\nhillocks and basins is locally developed by other means, but dunes are\r\nmade up of sand and usually of sand only, while the composition of\r\nsimilarly shaped hillocks and depressions shaped by other agencies is\r\nnotably different.\r\n\r\n  In Fig. 1, Plate II (Five Mile Beach, 8 miles northeast of Cape\r\n  May, N. J.), the contour interval is 10 feet. There is here but one\r\n  contour line (the 10-foot contour), though this appears in several\r\n  places. Since this line connects places 10 feet above sea-level,\r\n  all places between it and the sea (or marsh) are less than 10\r\n  feet above the water, while all places within the lines have an\r\n  elevation of more than 10 feet. None of them reaches an elevation\r\n  of 20 feet, since a 20-foot contour does not appear. It will be\r\n  seen that some of the elevations in Fig. 1 are elongate, while\r\n  others have the form of mounds.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2 (Pl. II) shows dune topography along the Arkansas River in\r\n  Kansas (near Larned); Fig. 4, dune topography in Nebraska (Lat.\r\n  42°, Long. 103°), not in immediate association with a valley or\r\n  shore; and Fig. 3 shows irregular ridge-like dunes at the head of\r\n  Lake Michigan. In Fig. 2 the contour interval is 20 feet. All the\r\n  small hillocks southeast of the river are dunes. Some of them are\r\n  represented by one contour and some by two. The altitude of the\r\n  region is considerable, the heavy contour representing an elevation\r\n  of 2100 feet; but the dunes themselves are rarely more than 20 feet\r\n  above their surroundings. In Fig. 4, where the contour interval is\r\n  also 20 feet, there are, besides the numerous hillocks, several\r\n  depressions (basins). These are represented by hachures inside the\r\n  contour lines. In some cases there are intermittent lakes (blue) in\r\n  the depressions. The heavy contour at Spring Lakes in this figure\r\n  is the contour of 4300 feet. There are two depression contours\r\n  (4280 and 4260) below it. The bottom of the depression is therefore\r\n  lower than 4260, but not so low as 4240. In Fig. 3 the contour\r\n  interval is 10 feet, and the dune ridges north of Miller are more\r\n  than 50 feet high. The dune ridges here have helped to determine\r\n  the position of this branch of the Calumet River, and have blocked\r\n  its former outlet. The present drainage is to the westward.\r\n\r\n=Migration of dunes.=—By the continual transfer of sand from its\r\nwindward to its leeward side, a dune may be moved from one place to\r\nanother, though continuing to be made up, in large part, of the same\r\nsand. In their migration dunes sometimes invade fertile lands, causing\r\nso great loss that means are devised for stopping them. The simplest\r\nmethod (employed in France and Holland) is to help vegetation to get\r\na foothold in the sand. The effect of the vegetation is to pin the\r\nsand down. As a dune ridge along a coast travels inland, another may be\r\nformed behind it. Successions of dune ridges are thus sometimes formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 16.—Diagram illustrating the migration of dunes\r\n  on the Kurische Nehrung. (Credner.)]\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the migration of a sand dune is recorded\r\non the Kurische Nehrung on the north coast of Germany. The Nehrung\r\nconsists of a long narrow neck of land composed of sand, lying\r\noff the main coast. At the beginning of this century there was a\r\nnotable dune ridge on one side. Since that time it has migrated a\r\nconsiderable distance, and in its migration it has been brought into\r\nthe relationships illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (Fig. 16).\r\nIn 1800 the dune ridge was on one side of a church, which was then in\r\nuse. In 1839 the ridge had been so far shifted to the leeward as to\r\ncompletely bury the church, and in 1869, its migration had progressed\r\nso far as to again discover the building.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 17.—Migration of dunes into a timbered region.\r\n  Dune Park, Ind. Head of Lake Michigan. (Meyers.)]\r\n\r\nWhen dunes migrate into a timbered region they bury and kill the trees\r\n(Fig. 17). In one instance on the coast of Prussia a tall pine forest,\r\ncovering hundreds of acres, was destroyed during the brief period\r\nbetween 1804 and 1827.[17] At some points in New Jersey orchards have\r\nbeen so far buried within the lifetime of their owners that only the\r\ntops of the highest trees are exposed. Trees and other objects once\r\nburied may be again discovered by farther migration of the sand (Figs.\r\n18 and 19).[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 18.—A resurrected forest. The dune sand after\r\n  burying and killing the timber has been shifted beyond it. Dune Park.\r\n  Ind. (Meyers.)]\r\n\r\nEolian sand, not aggregated into distinct dunes, is often destructive.\r\nEven valleys and cities are sometimes buried by it. Drifting sands had\r\nso completely buried Nineveh two centuries after its destruction that\r\nits site was unknown.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of dunes.=—Dunes are likely to be developed wherever dry\r\nsand is exposed to the wind. Their favorite situations are the dry and\r\nsandy shores of lakes and seas, sandy valleys, and arid sandy plains.\r\n\r\nAlong coasts, dunes are likely to be extensively developed only where\r\nthe prevailing winds are on shore. Thus about Lake Michigan, where the\r\nprevailing winds are from the west, dunes are abundant and large on the\r\neast shore, and but few and small on the west. In shallow water, shore\r\ncurrents and storm waves often build up a reef of sand a little above\r\nthe normal level of the water. When the waves subside, the sand dries\r\nand the wind heaps it up into dunes. This sequence of events is in\r\nprogress at many points on the Atlantic Coast. Sandy Hook, New Jersey,\r\nand the “beaches” farther south started as barrier ridges. When the\r\nwaves had built them above normal water-level, the wind re-worked the\r\nsand, piling it up into mounds and hillocks (Fig. 1, Pl. II). Such dune\r\nbelts a little off shore are sometimes turned to good account. They are\r\nusually separated from the mainland by a shallow lagoon. Where land\r\nis valuable, the lagoon is sometimes filled in, making new land, thus\r\nanticipating the result which nature would achieve more slowly. This\r\nhas been done at some points on the western coast of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 19.—Migration of dune sand exposing bones in a\r\n  cemetery. Hatteras Island, N. C. (Collier Cobb.)]\r\n\r\nDunes are likely to occur along stream valleys (Fig. 2, Pl. II), if\r\ntheir bottoms or slopes are of sand, and not covered by vegetation.\r\nDunes along valleys are usually on the side toward which the\r\nprevailing winds blow. Thus they are more common on the east side of\r\nthe Mississippi than on the west. Dunes may be formed in the valley\r\nbottoms, but the sand is often blown up out of the valley and lodged on\r\nthe bluffs above.\r\n\r\nApart from these special classes of situations, any sandy region the\r\nsurface of which is dry is likely to have its surface material shifted\r\nby the wind and piled up into dune ridges or hillocks (Fig. 4, Pl.\r\nII). Dunes probably reach their greatest development in the Sahara,\r\nwhere some of them take the form of hillocks, and some the form of\r\nridges. Travelers in that region report that dune ridges are sometimes\r\nencountered the faces of which are so high and steep as to be difficult\r\nof ascent, and that parties have been obliged to travel miles along\r\ntheir bases before finding a break where crossing was practicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 20.—Wind-ripples. (Cross, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Wind-ripples.=—The surface of the dry sand over which the wind has\r\nblown for a few hours is likely to be marked with ripples (Fig.\r\n20) similar to those made on a sandy bottom beneath shallow water,\r\nunder the influence of waves. Like ripple marks made by the water,\r\nwind-ripples have one side (the lee) steeper than the other. While the\r\nripples are, as a rule, but a fraction of an inch high, they throw\r\nmuch light on the origin of the great dune ridges. If the ripples\r\nbe watched closely during the progress of a wind-storm, they are\r\nfound gradually to shift their position. Sand is blown up the gentler\r\nwindward slope to the crest of the ridge and falls down on the other\r\nside. The moment it falls below the crest of the ridge to leeward, it\r\nis protected against the wind, and is likely to lodge. Wear on the\r\nwindward side is about equal to deposition on the leeward, and the\r\nresult is the orderly progression of the ripples in the direction in\r\nwhich the wind is blowing, just as in the case of dune ridges.\r\n\r\n=Abrasion by the wind.=—While the effect of the wind on sandy and dusty\r\nsurfaces may be considerable, its effect on solid rock is relatively\r\nslight and accomplished, not by its own impact, but by that of the\r\nmaterial it carries. The effect of blown sand on rock surfaces over and\r\nagainst which it is driven is perhaps best understood by recalling the\r\neffects of artificial sand-blasts, by means of which glass is etched.\r\nIn a region where sand is blowing, exposed surfaces of rock suffer\r\nfrom a multitude of blows struck by the sand grains in transit. The\r\nresult is that such rock surfaces are worn, and worn in a way peculiar\r\nto the agency accomplishing the work. If the rock be made up of laminæ\r\nwhich are of unequal hardness, the blown sand digs out the softer ones,\r\nleaving the harder projecting as ridges between them. Adjacent masses\r\nof harder and softer rock of whatever thickness are similarly affected.\r\nThe sculpturing thus effected on projecting masses of rock is often\r\npicturesque and striking (Figs. 21 and 22), and is most common in arid\r\nregions. Details of wind-carving are shown in Fig. 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 21.—Wind-carved rock. (Green.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. KANSAS.\r\n\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. INDIANA.\r\n\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4. NEBRASKA.\r\n\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\nSand drifted over loose stones lying on the surface often develops\r\nflat or flattish faces or facets on them. These facets are likely to\r\nbe three in number, and the exposed portion of the stone is likely to\r\ndevelop a sort of pyramidal shape, the three flattish surfaces being\r\nmutually limited by tolerably well-defined lines (Fig. 24). Thus arise\r\nthe three-faceted stones (_Dreikanter_ of the Germans) commonly seen\r\nwhere sands have been long in movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 22.—Wind-carved hillock of cross-bedded\r\n  sandstone. Missouri River, Montana. (Calhoun, U. S. G. S.)]\r\n\r\nNot only does the drifting sand wear the surface over which it passes\r\nand against which it strikes, but the grains themselves are worn in the\r\nprocess. They are liable to be broken as they strike rock surfaces, and\r\nthey are likely to strike one another in the atmosphere. In both cases\r\nthey are subject to wear, and so to reduction to a finer and finer\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe erosion accomplished by the wind is therefore of various sorts. The\r\nimpact of the wind itself picks up the fine materials which are already\r\nloosened, thus wearing down the surface from which they are removed;\r\nthe materials picked up wear the rock surfaces against which they are\r\nblown, and the transported materials themselves suffer reduction in\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\n=Effects of wind on plants.=—Another effect of wind work is seen in the\r\nuprooting of trees (Fig. 25). The uprooting disturbs the surface in\r\nsuch a way as to make loose earth more readily accessible to wind and\r\nwater. The uprooting of trees on steep slopes often causes the descent\r\nof considerable quantities of loose rock and soil. Again, organisms\r\nof various sorts (certain types of seeds, germs, etc.), as well as\r\ndust and sand, are extensively transported by the wind. While this is\r\nimportant biologically its geological effects are remote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 23.—Figure showing details of wind-carving on\r\n  rock surface (rhyolite). Mono Valley, California.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 24.—Wind-worn stones (_Dreikanter_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 25.—Shows the disturbance of surface earth and\r\n  rocks by upturning of trees. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Indirect effects of the wind.=—Other dynamic processes are called into\r\nbeing or stimulated by the atmosphere. Winds generate both waves and\r\ncurrents, and both are effective agents in geological work. The results\r\nof their activities are discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _II. The Chemical Work of the Atmosphere._\r\n\r\nThe chemical work of the atmosphere (including solution and\r\nprecipitation from solution) is principally accomplished in connection\r\nwith water, a dry atmosphere having relatively little direct chemical\r\neffect on rock or soils.\r\n\r\n=Precipitation from solution.=—The water in the soil is constantly\r\nevaporating. Such substances as it contains in solution are deposited\r\nwhere the water evaporates, and where evaporation is long continued\r\nwithout re-solution of the substances deposited, the surface becomes\r\ncoated with an efflorescence of mineral matter. Conspicuous examples\r\nare found in the alkali plains of certain areas in the western part of\r\nthe United States. Since the alkaline efflorescence is the result of\r\nevaporation it is connected with the atmosphere, but the material of\r\nthe efflorescence was brought to its present position by water. The\r\nprinciple involved is illustrated by the white efflorescence which\r\nfrequently appears on brick walls during the dry days which follow a\r\ndrenching rain. The water penetrates the brick and mortar and dissolves\r\nsomething of their substance, and when it is evaporated from the\r\nsurface the material in solution is left behind.\r\n\r\nIn arid regions the deposition of substances other than alkali is\r\ncommon. The percolating waters dissolve whatever is soluble, and when\r\nthey evaporate their mineral content is left. The pebbles and stones of\r\nthe arid plains have in many places become heavily coated with mineral\r\nmatter deposited in this way, and not infrequently cemented into\r\nconglomerate. One of the commonest mineral substances found in such\r\nsituations is lime carbonate. In some cases it was doubtless derived\r\nby solution from limestone beds beneath the surface, but this is not\r\nalways the case. It often encrusts the bits of lava on lava plains\r\nwhere it can hardly have been derived from limestone. The faces of\r\ncliffs of granite or gneiss, hundreds and even thousands of feet above\r\nall other sorts of rock,[19] are sometimes spotted with patches of lime\r\ncarbonate. In the first case the lime carbonate was derived by chemical\r\nchange from the lava, and in the second, from the granite or gneiss\r\n(see _Carbonation_ below), but its present position is the result of\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n=Oxidation.=—In the presence of moisture the oxygen of the air enters\r\ninto combination with various elements of the soil and rocks. This is\r\n_oxidation_. No other common mineral substance shows the results of\r\noxidation so quickly and so distinctly as iron. The oxidized portion\r\nis loose and friable, and a mass of iron exposed to a moist atmosphere\r\nwill ultimately crumble away. This change is comparable to other less\r\nobvious changes taking place in many minerals at and below the surface.\r\nOxidation generally involves the disintegration of the rock concerned.\r\nIts effects in this direction will be referred to in other connections.\r\n\r\n=Carbonation.=—The production of lime carbonate from rock containing\r\ncalcium compounds, but not in the form of carbonates, is known as\r\n_carbonation_, and is one of the important chemical changes effected\r\nby the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere in coöperation with water. In\r\nthe process of carbonation the original minerals of complex composition\r\nare decomposed and simpler ones usually formed. Volumetric changes are\r\ninvolved, which often lead to the disruption of the rock (see _Ground\r\nwater_). Furthermore, carbonates are among the more soluble minerals,\r\nand their production therefore brings some of the rock materials into\r\na soluble condition, and their extraction through solution tends still\r\nfurther to disintegrate the rock. The carbonation of crystalline rocks\r\nis therefore a disintegrating process, and will be considered further\r\nin its many concrete applications.\r\n\r\n=Other chemical changes.=—A third chemical process which often\r\naccompanies oxidation and carbonation is _hydration_. This is effected\r\nby water rather than by air, and will be considered in that connection.\r\nIn general it leads to the disintegration of the minerals and rocks\r\naffected. The chemical effects of nitric acid, etc., developed through\r\nthe agency of atmospheric electricity, and the corresponding effects\r\nof the gases and vapors which issue from volcanoes, many of them\r\nchemically active, are to be mentioned in this connection.\r\n\r\n=Conditions favorable for chemical changes.=—Conditions are not\r\neverywhere equally favorable for the chemical work of the atmosphere.\r\nIn general, high temperatures facilitate chemical action, and, other\r\nthings being equal, rocks are more readily decomposed by atmospheric\r\naction in warm than in cold regions. Chemical activity is probably\r\ngreater where the climate is continuously warm than where there are\r\ngreat changes of temperature. Changes of temperature, on the other\r\nhand, tend to disrupt rock, and thus increase the amount of surface\r\nexposed to chemical change. Since nearly all the chemical changes\r\nworked by the atmosphere on the rocks are increased by the presence of\r\nmoisture, the chemical activity of the atmosphere is greater in moist\r\nthan in dry regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n              B. THE ATMOSPHERE AS A CONDITIONING AGENCY.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious mechanical work of the atmosphere is effected by the\r\nwind, but mechanical results of great importance, conditioned by the\r\natmosphere, are also effected when the air is still.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _I. Temperature Effects._\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shines on bare rock its surface is heated and expanded,\r\nand the expanded particles crowd one another with great force. Since\r\nrock is a poor conductor of heat its surface is heated and expanded\r\nnotably more than parts beneath the surface. It follows that strains\r\nare set up between the expanded outer portion and the cooler and less\r\nexpanded parts within. In the cooling of the same rock mass it is the\r\noutermost portion which cools first and fastest, and, contracting as\r\nit cools, strains are again set up between the outer part, which is\r\ncooled more, and the inner part, which is cooled less. The result may\r\nbe illustrated by the effect of cold water on hot glass, or of hot\r\nwater on cold glass. In either case the fracture is the result of the\r\nsudden and considerable differential expansion or contraction. Since\r\nthe heating and cooling of rock are much slower than the heating and\r\ncooling of glass under the conditions mentioned, the rupturing effects\r\nare less conspicuous, but none the less real. The actual effects\r\nof temperature changes are illustrated by familiar phenomena. The\r\nsurface portions of bowlders exposed to the sun are frequently seen\r\nto be shelling off (Fig. 26). The loosened concentric shells may be a\r\nfraction of an inch, or sometimes even several inches in thickness.\r\nThis process of _exfoliation_ affects not only bowlders, but bare\r\nrock surfaces wherever exposed to the sun (Figs. 27, 28). It is often\r\nconspicuous on the faces of cliffs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 26.—Exfoliation. A bowlder of weathering, the\r\n  rock being granite. Wichita Mountains, Oklahoma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 27.—A weathered summit of granite in the Wichita\r\n  Mountains. Oklahoma. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nSeveral conditions, some of which are connected with the atmosphere and\r\nsome with the rock, determine the efficiency of this process. Since\r\nthe breaking of the rock results from the expansion and contraction\r\ndue to its changes of temperature, it follows that, other things being\r\nequal, the greater the change, the greater the breaking; but the\r\nsuddenness of the temperature change is even more important than its\r\namount. It follows that great daily, rather than great annual, changes\r\nof temperature[20] favor rock-breaking, though with changes of a given\r\nfrequency their effectiveness is greater the greater their range. A\r\npartial exception to this generalization should be noted. If abundant\r\nmoisture is present in the pores and cracks of the rock a change of\r\ntemperature from 45° to 35° (Fahr.) might be far less effective in\r\nbreaking the rock than a change from 35° to 25° in the same time, for\r\nin the latter case the sudden and very considerable expansion (about\r\none-tenth) which water undergoes on freezing is brought into play. This\r\nmay be called the _wedge-work of ice_. The daily range of temperature\r\nis influenced especially by latitude, altitude, and humidity. Other\r\nthings being equal, the greatest daily ranges of temperature occur\r\nin high-temperate latitudes, though to this general statement there\r\nare local exceptions, depending on other conditions. High altitudes\r\nfavor great daily ranges of temperature, so far as the rock surface\r\nis concerned (see Figs. 29, 30), for though the rock becomes heated\r\nduring the sunny day, the thinness and dryness of the atmosphere allow\r\nits heat to radiate rapidly at night. Here, too, the daily range of\r\ntemperature is likely to bring the wedge-work of ice into play. Since\r\nthe south side of a mountain (in the northern hemisphere) is heated\r\nmore than the north, it is subject to the greater daily range of\r\ntemperature, and the rock on this side suffers the greater disruption.\r\nSimilarly, rock surfaces on which the sun shines daily are subject to\r\ngreater disruption than those much shielded by clouds. Isolated peaks,\r\nbecause of their greater exposure, are subject to rather greater daily\r\nranges of temperature than plateaus of the same elevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 28.—Exfoliation on a mountain slope. Mt.\r\n  Starr-King (Cal.) from the north.]\r\n\r\nThe daily range of temperature is also influenced by humidity. Because\r\nof the effect of water vapor in the atmosphere on insolation and\r\nradiation, a rock surface becomes hotter in the day and cooler at night\r\nbeneath a dry atmosphere than beneath a moist one. Aridity therefore\r\nfavors the disruption of rock by changing temperatures.\r\n\r\nTurning from the conditions of the atmosphere which affect the\r\ndisruption of rock to the conditions of the rock which influence the\r\nsame process, several points are to be noted. In the first place, the\r\ndisrupting effects of changes of temperature are slight or nil where\r\nthe solid rock is protected by soil, clay, sand, gravel, snow, or other\r\nincoherent material. If the constituent parts of the loose material are\r\ncoarse, like bowlders, their surfaces are affected like those of larger\r\nbodies of rock. The color of rock, its texture and its composition,\r\nalso influence its range of daily temperature by influencing absorption\r\nand conduction. Dark-colored rocks absorb more heat than light-colored\r\nones, and compact rocks are better conductors than porous ones. Great\r\nabsorption and slow conduction favor disruption. A given range of\r\ntemperature is unequally effective on rocks of different mineral\r\ncomposition. In general crystalline rocks (igneous and metamorphic) are\r\nmore subject to disruption by this means than sedimentary rocks, partly\r\nbecause they are more compact, but especially because they are made up\r\nof aggregates of crystals of different minerals which, under changes of\r\ntemperature, expand and contract at different rates, while the common\r\nsedimentary rocks are made up largely of numerous particles of one\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 29.—Top of Notch Peak, Bighorn Mountains, Wyo.\r\n  Shows the thoroughly broken character of the rock on the summit, the\r\n  absence of soil, vegetation, etc. (Kümmel.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 30.—A detail from Fig. 29 showing the size of the\r\n  rock blocks. (Kümmel.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 31.—Peak north of Kearsarge Pass, the Sierras.\r\n  Shows the way in which serrate peaks break up into angular blocks.]\r\n\r\nThe freezing of water in the pores of rock is effective in disrupting\r\nthem only when the pores are essentially full at the time of freezing.\r\nOtherwise there is room for the expansion attending the freezing. If\r\nthe pores of the rock are large, the expansion on freezing may force\r\nout sufficient water to balance the increase of volume, even though the\r\nrock was completely saturated. If the pores be very small the water\r\npasses out less readily, and if the rock is saturated, freezing is more\r\nlikely to be attended with disruption.[21]\r\n\r\nIn view of these considerations the breaking of rock by changes\r\nof temperature should be greatest on the bare slopes of isolated\r\nelevations of crystalline rock, where the temperature conditions of\r\ntemperate latitudes prevail, and where the atmosphere is relatively\r\nfree from moisture. All these conditions are not often found in one\r\nplace, but the disrupting effects of changing temperatures are best\r\nseen where several of them are associated (Figs. 29, 30, and 31).\r\n\r\nThe importance of this method of rock-breaking has rarely been\r\nappreciated except by those who have worked in high and dry regions.\r\nClimbers of high mountains know that almost every high peak is covered\r\nwith broken rock to such an extent as to make its ascent dangerous to\r\nthe uninitiated. High serrate peaks, especially of crystalline rock,\r\nare, as a rule, literally crumbling to pieces (Fig. 31). The piles\r\nof talus which lie at the bases of steep mountain slopes are often\r\nhundreds of feet in height, and their materials are often in large part\r\nthe result of the process here under discussion. In mountain regions\r\nwhere atmospheric conditions favor sudden changes of temperature, the\r\nsharp reports of the disruption of rock masses are often heard. Masses\r\nof rock, scores and even hundreds of pounds in weight, are frequently\r\nthus detached and started on their downward course.[22] Small pieces\r\nof rock are of course much more commonly broken off than large ones.\r\nThe disruption of rock by changes of temperature is not usually the\r\nresult of a single change of temperature, but rather of many successive\r\nexpansions and contractions.\r\n\r\nThe sharp needle-like peaks which mark the summits of most high\r\nmountain ranges (Fig. 32) are largely developed by the process here\r\noutlined. The altitude at which the serrate topography appears varies\r\nwith the latitude, being, as a rule, higher in low latitudes and lower\r\nin high. But even in the same latitude it varies notably with the\r\nisolation of the mountains and with the aridity of the climate. Thus\r\nwithin the United States the sharply serrate summits appear in some\r\nplaces, as in Washington and Oregon, at altitudes of 6000 to 10,000\r\nfeet, while in the isolated Wichita range of Oklahoma, much farther\r\nsouth, but in a much drier climate, the same sort of topography is\r\ndeveloped at altitudes of 2500 to 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nEven in low latitudes and moist climates the effects of temperature\r\nchanges are often seen. Thin beds of limestone at the bottom of\r\nquarries are sometimes so expanded by the heat of the sun as to arch up\r\nand break.[23] In desert and arid regions,[24] whatever the altitude,\r\nthe effects of temperature changes are often striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 32.—Serrate peaks of granitic rock in Black\r\n  Hills. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe disruption of rock by changes of temperature is one phase of\r\nweathering. It tends to the formation of a mantle of rock waste, which,\r\nwere it not removed, would soon completely cover the solid rock beneath\r\nand protect it from further disruption by heating and cooling; but the\r\nloose material thus produced becomes an easy prey to running water,\r\nso that the work of the atmosphere prepares the way for that of other\r\neroding agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _II. Evaporation and Precipitation._\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important work of the atmosphere as a dynamic\r\nagent lies in its function as the medium for the circulation and\r\ndistribution of water. Atmospheric temperature is the primary\r\nfactor governing evaporation, an important factor in the circulation\r\nof the vapor after it is formed, and controls its condensation and\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nThe average amount of annual precipitation on the land is variously\r\nestimated at from forty to sixty inches, the lesser figure being\r\nprobably more nearly correct. Since much of this water falls at high\r\naltitudes, the work which it accomplishes in getting back to the sea\r\nis great. The water which falls on the land, if withdrawn wholly from\r\nthe ocean, would exhaust that body of water in 10,000 to 15,000 years\r\nif none of it returned. The work of evaporation is of course not done\r\nby the atmosphere, though the atmosphere determines the effect of the\r\nsolar energy which does the work.[25]\r\n\r\nThe precipitation is distributed with great inequality, and this\r\ninequality affects both the rain and the snow. Some regions have heavy\r\nprecipitation and some light; some regions have much rain and little\r\nsnow; others have much snow and little rain; others have rain and no\r\nsnow, and still others have snow and little or no rain. The amount and\r\ndistribution of rain and snow determine the size and distribution of\r\nstreams and glaciers, and streams and glaciers are the most important\r\nagencies modifying the surface of the land.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to separate sharply the geologic work of the water of\r\nthe atmosphere from that of other waters; but so long as moisture is in\r\nthe atmosphere (including the time of its precipitation) its effects\r\nare best considered in connection with the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n=The mechanical work of the rain.=—In falling the rain washes the\r\natmosphere, taking from it much of the dust, spores, etc., which the\r\nwinds have lifted from the surface of the dry land. Not only this,\r\nbut in passing through the atmosphere the water dissolves some of its\r\ngases, and perhaps particles of soluble solid matter. When therefore\r\nthe falling water reaches the surface of the land it is no longer pure,\r\nand some of the gases it has taken up in its descent enable it to\r\ndissolve various mineral matters on which pure water has little effect.\r\n\r\nAs it falls on the surface of the land the rain produces various\r\neffects of a mechanical nature. In the first place, it leaves on the\r\nsurface the solid matter taken from the air. The amount of material,\r\nthus added to any given region in any particular shower is trivial,\r\nbut in the course of long periods of time the total amount of material\r\nwashed out of the air must be very great.\r\n\r\nEvery rain-drop strikes a blow. If the drops fall on vegetation,\r\nthey have little effect, but if they fall on sand or unprotected\r\nearthy matter they cause movements of the particles on one another,\r\nand this movement involves friction and wear. While the results thus\r\neffected are inconsiderable in any brief period of time, they are not\r\nso insignificant when the long periods of the earth’s history are\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nClayey soils contract and often crack on drying. Falling on such a soil\r\nwhen it is dry the rain causes it to expand, and the cracks are healed\r\nby lateral swelling. The same soils are baked under the influence of\r\nthe sun, and when in this condition are softened and made more mobile\r\nby the falling of rain. Under the influence of the expansion and\r\ncontraction occasioned by wetting and drying, the soils and earths on\r\nslopes creep slowly downward. When rain falls on dry sand or dust the\r\ncohesion is at once increased, and shifting by the wind is temporarily\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nAfter the water has fallen on the land its further work cannot be\r\nlooked upon as a part of the work of the atmosphere; but any conception\r\nof the geological work of the atmosphere which did not recognize the\r\nfact that the waters of the land have come through the atmosphere would\r\nbe inadequate. The work of the water after it has been precipitated\r\nfrom the atmosphere must be considered in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _III. Effects of Electricity._\r\n\r\nAnother dynamic effect conditioned by the atmosphere is that produced\r\nby lightning. In the aggregate this result is inconsequential; yet\r\ninstances are known where large bodies of rock have been fractured by\r\na stroke of lightning, and masses many tons in weight have sometimes\r\nbeen moved appreciable distances. Incipient fusion in very limited\r\nspots is also known to have been induced by lightning. Where it strikes\r\nsand it often fuses the sand for a short distance, and, on cooling,\r\nthe partially fused material is consolidated, forming a little tube or\r\nirregular rod (a _fulgurite_) of partially glassy matter. Fulgurites\r\nare usually only a few inches in length, and more commonly than\r\notherwise a fraction of an inch in diameter. Strictly speaking these\r\nresults are the effect of the electricity of the atmosphere rather\r\nthan of the atmosphere itself, but they are best mentioned in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to the chemical changes in the\r\natmosphere occasioned by electric discharges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 33.—Stratified jointed rock in process of\r\n  weathering. (Cross, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 34.—Represents a later stage of the processes\r\n  illustrated by Fig. 33. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SUMMARY.\r\n\r\n=Weathering.=—The result of all atmospheric processes, whether physical\r\nor chemical, by which surface rock is disrupted, decomposed or in any\r\nway loosened, is _weathering_. This convenient term also includes\r\nsimilar results effected by ground water, plants, etc. The tendency\r\nof weathering is to produce a mantle of residuary earth over solid\r\nrock. Weathering by mechanical means tends to produce material which,\r\nthough in a finer state of division, is still like the original rock\r\nin chemical composition. Weathering by chemical means tends to produce\r\na mantle made up chiefly of the less soluble parts of the rock from\r\nwhich it was derived. All processes of weathering prepare material for\r\ntransportation by wind and water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig 35.+—Details of a weathered rock surface, due\r\n  partly to wind work and partly to solution. The particular phase\r\n  of weathering illustrated by this figure is known as “honeycomb”\r\n  weathering. (Gilbert, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nMany considerations determine the thickness which the mantle of\r\nweathered rock (mantle rock) attains. Some of these considerations have\r\nto do with the atmosphere, and some with drainage. Since the latter\r\nare, on the whole, more important, this matter will be discussed in\r\nconnection with the work of water (Chapters III and IV).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                      THE WORK OF RUNNING WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamiliar phenomena, both of land and sea, reveal the constant activity\r\nand importance of water as a geologic agent. Even when there is no\r\nprecipitation the moisture in the air influences its activity in\r\ncertain ways. Just as iron “rusts” more readily in moist air than\r\nin dry, so changes in other mineral substances are influenced by\r\natmospheric humidity. Where precipitation takes place the results are\r\nmore obvious. The passing shower works changes in the surface of the\r\nland, striking in proportion to the rate and amount of precipitation.\r\nThe rains feed the streams, and every stream is modifying its bed, and\r\nwith increasing rapidity as its current is swollen. Even the moisture\r\nwhich is precipitated as snow works its appropriate results. Before it\r\nmelts it protects the surface against other agents of change; but if\r\nit accumulates in sufficient quantity in appropriate situations, it\r\nmay give rise to avalanches and glaciers, which, like running water,\r\ndegrade the surface over which they pass.\r\n\r\nA part of the water which falls as rain, and a part of that which\r\nresults from the melting of snow and ice, sinks into the soil and into\r\nthe rock below, becoming _ground water_. It is this ground water which\r\nespecially justifies the name _hydrosphere_, often applied to the\r\nwaters of the earth, for it literally forms a spherical layer in the\r\nouter portion of the solid part of the earth. During the stay of the\r\nwater beneath the surface it effects changes in the rocks through which\r\nit passes, dissolving mineral matter here and depositing it there,\r\nsubstituting one substance for another in this place, and effecting new\r\nchemical combinations in that. Slow as these processes are, they have\r\nworked wondrous changes in the course of the earth’s history.\r\n\r\nWhen the waters are gathered together in ponds, lakes, and oceans, they\r\nare still active, and the results of their activity are seen along the\r\nshores, where winds and waves produce their chiefest effects. Even the\r\nocean currents, far from land, and the processes of the deep sea, are\r\nnot without their effect on the course of geological history.\r\n\r\nThe work of the _surface waters_, _ground_ (_underground_) _waters_,\r\n_standing waters_, and _ice_ will be considered in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RAIN AND RIVER EROSION.\r\n\r\nRain and river erosion began when the first rains fell on land\r\nsurfaces. Neither the location nor the nature of the first land surface\r\nis known. There is little reason to believe that the ocean was ever\r\nuniversal, but there is reason to believe that most land areas have at\r\nsome time or other been covered by the sea. The prevalent conception\r\nthat land areas which were once submerged came into existence by being\r\nelevated above sea-level, should be supplemented by the alternative\r\nconception that submerged areas may have become land by the depression\r\nof the ocean basins, thus drawing off the water from the areas where it\r\nwas shallow. Thus in Fig. 36 the sinking of the sea-bottom from _a_ to\r\n_b_ would lower the surface of the water from _cc′_, to _dd′_, and draw\r\noff the water from the surfaces _cd_ and _c′d′_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 36.—Diagram to illustrate the origin of lands by\r\n  the lowering of the sea-level due to depression of the sea bottom. If\r\n  the bottom is depressed from _a_ to _b_ the surface will be drawn\r\n  down from _cc′_ to _dd′_, and the surfaces _cd_ and _c′d′_ will become\r\n  land.]\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to picture the character of the original land our\r\nstudy of subaërial erosion may begin with an area which has just been\r\nchanged from sea bottom to land. What is the nature of such a land\r\nsurface? Of what material is it composed, and what is the character of\r\nits topography? Concerning its constitution something may be inferred\r\nfrom the nature of the deposits now found at the bottom of the sea.\r\nNear the shore and in shallow water they often consist of gravel and\r\nsand, though other materials are not wanting. Far from shore and in\r\ndeep water they consist for the most part of fine sediments, some of\r\nwhich were washed or blown from the land, some of which came from the\r\nshells and other secretions of marine animals, some from volcanoes, and\r\nsome from various other sources. The topography of the newly emerged\r\nland may have had some likeness to the topography of the sea bottom.\r\nThe numerous soundings which have been made over large areas of the\r\nsea have shown that its bottom is, as a rule, free from the numerous\r\nsmall irregularities which affect the surface of the land. They seem\r\nto show that a large part of the ocean bottom is so nearly flat that,\r\nif the water were removed, the eye would hardly detect irregularities\r\nin the surface. This statement does not lose sight of the fact that\r\nthe ocean bottom is, in certain places, markedly irregular. Volcanic\r\npeaks and striking irregularities of other sorts abound in some places.\r\nNevertheless if the bottom of the sea could be seen as the land is, its\r\nmost striking feature, taken as a whole, would be its apparent flatness.\r\n\r\nWith the topography of the sea bottom the topography of the land is,\r\nin its details, in sharp contrast. In order to get at the history of\r\nthe latter, we may study the sequence of events which would follow the\r\nemergence of a portion of the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Subaërial Erosion without Valleys._\r\n\r\nFor the sake of emphasizing the fundamental principles involved in\r\nthe work of running water, a hypothetical case will first be studied\r\nin some detail, even at the risk of elaborating processes already\r\nunderstood. The principles themselves will find application later in\r\nrelations which are much less simple.\r\n\r\nLet it be assumed that the area of newly emerged land is a circular\r\ndome-shaped island. The simplest possible condition is represented by\r\nassuming its slope to be the same in all directions from the center,\r\nand its materials to be absolutely homogeneous. Such an island would\r\nbe subject to all the forces ordinarily operating on land surfaces.\r\nThe chief agency tending to modify land surfaces is atmospheric\r\nprecipitation. It will be assumed that the rain falls on the surface\r\nof the island with absolute equality at all points, and that all other\r\nforces which affect it operate equally everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe rain falling on a land area disappears in various ways; part of it\r\nevaporates, part of it sinks, and part of it runs off over the surface.\r\nIf the island be composed of fine and unconsolidated materials, such\r\nas clay, the water which runs off over the surface will carry sediment\r\ndown to the sea. If the island be composed of solid rock instead,\r\nexposure to the air will cause it to decay, and the products of decay,\r\nsuch as sand and mud, will suffer a like fate.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of a clear understanding of the processes involved, two\r\ncases may be postulated; one in which the waters of the sea remove the\r\nsediment washed down from the hypothetical island as fast as it reaches\r\nthe shore, and one in which they allow it to accumulate without let or\r\nhindrance. In both cases the wear of the waves will be neglected.\r\n\r\n1. In the first case the water flowing off over the surface (the\r\n_run-off_) will descend equally in all directions. It will constitute a\r\ncontinuous sheet of surface-water, and both its volume and its velocity\r\nwill be the same at all points equally distant from the summit. Erosion\r\naccomplished by sheets of running water, as distinct from streams, is\r\n_sheet_ (or _sheet-flood_) _erosion_.[26] Since the material of the\r\nsurface is homogeneous, the wear effected by the water will be equal\r\nat all points where its velocity and volume are equal. For obvious\r\nreasons the depth of the run-off will increase from summit to base.\r\nThe gradient (slope) also increases in the same direction, and the\r\nincrease of volume and of gradient conspire to augment the velocity\r\nof the water, and therefore of the wear effected by it. If the thin\r\nsheet of water starting from the top of the island with relatively\r\nlow velocity be able to wash off even a little fine material from the\r\nsurface, the thicker sheet farther down the slope, moving with greater\r\nvelocity, will be able to carry away more of the same sort of material,\r\nand the increase will be progressive from summit to base. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that the surface will be worn equally at points equally\r\ndistant from the summit, but unequally at points unequally distant\r\nfrom it. The first shower which falls on the island may be conceived\r\nto wash off from its surface a very thin sheet of material, but a\r\nsheet which increases in thickness from top to bottom. The run-off\r\nwill not be stopped immediately on reaching the sea, but will displace\r\nthe sea-water to some slight depth, and wear the surface some trivial\r\ndistance below the normal level of the sea. The result of successive\r\nshowers working in the same way through a long period of time will\r\nbe to diminish the area of the island and to steepen its slopes. The\r\nresults of a considerable period of erosion under these conditions\r\nare shown diagrammatically in Fig. 37, which illustrates both the\r\ndiminution in area which the island has suffered, and the increase in\r\nthe angle of its slopes. Immediately about it, at the stage represented\r\nby _aa_, Fig. 37, there is a narrow marginal platform, or submerged\r\nterrace, in place of the land area which has been worn away at or just\r\nbelow the level of the sea. Long successions of rains working in the\r\nsame way will give the island steeper slopes, a smaller area, and a\r\nwider marginal terrace. Successive stages are shown by the lines _bb_\r\nand _cc_, Fig. 37.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 37.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of rain\r\n  erosion on an island where there is no deposition or wave erosion\r\n  about its borders. The uppermost curve represents the original\r\n  surface, while _aa_, _bb_, and _cc_ represent successive surfaces\r\n  developed by sheet erosion, on the supposition that no material is\r\n  deposited along the shores.]\r\n\r\nIf rain falls on such an island until it completes the work which\r\nit is possible for running water to do, the island will be reduced\r\nessentially to the level of the sea, and in its place there will be a\r\nplain, the area of which will be equal to that of the original island.\r\nIts central point will be at the level of the sea, and its borders a\r\ntrifling distance below it (Fig. 38). The island is gone, and in its\r\nplace there is a plain as low as running water can wear it. Other\r\nagencies might come in to defeat the result just outlined, but if the\r\nisland did not rise or sink after its formation, rain falling upon\r\nit would, _under the conditions specified_, finally bring about the\r\nresult which has been sketched. The plain (Fig. 38) which succeeds the\r\nisland is a _base-level of erosion_, though this term is also used in\r\nother ways. Under these conditions the slope of the land would remain\r\nconvex at all stages, but the convex erosion profile of the land\r\nwould meet a nearly straight line just below sea-level. The relative\r\nlengths of these two elements of the profile, the curve above and the\r\nstraight line below, vary as erosion progresses, the convex portion\r\nbecoming shorter and the other longer, The two parts of the profile\r\ntaken together are concave upward at the lower end all the time, and\r\nfor a greater distance from its lower end in all the advanced stages of\r\nerosion (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 38.—Diagram to illustrate the final effect of\r\n  rain erosion under the conditions specified in the text. The diagram\r\n  expresses the final result of the processes suggested by Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\nIn the destruction of the land under these conditions _neither valleys\r\nnor hills would be developed_, nor would the topography of the land be\r\nfashioned to correspond with the surfaces with which we are familiar.\r\n\r\nIt is to be distinctly borne in mind that the foregoing is a\r\nhypothetical case; it is not probable that such an island ever existed,\r\nor ever will; but that does not diminish the value of the illustration,\r\nsince the principles involved are operating on every land mass, though\r\nin less simple relations.\r\n\r\n2. The second case differs from the first in that the sediment washed\r\ndown from the land is deposited about its borders. This results in\r\nthe building up of a marginal platform, as shown in Figs. 39–41. As\r\nerosion goes on more sediment is washed down and deposited, partly on\r\nthe narrow marginal shelf which has already been developed, and partly\r\non its outer slope, as shown in the figures. The marginal flat is thus\r\nextended beyond the original shores of the island on the one hand, and\r\ntoward its center on the other. As it develops, its inner portion,\r\nand indeed all except its outer edge (_ab_, Figs. 40 and 41), will be\r\ngradually built up above the level of the water. This marginal lowland\r\nis developed at a level as low as running water, _under the conditions\r\nthen and there present_, can reduce the land. Such a surface may be\r\nsaid to be at _grade_, since running water neither wears it down nor\r\nbuilds it up. Its angle of slope is a function of (1) the volume of the\r\nwater running over it, and (2) of the load which the water carries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 39–41.—Diagrams to illustrate the effect of\r\n  rain erosion on an island when all the eroded material is deposited\r\n  about the shore. The black portions represent deposition. The dotted\r\n  lines represent the original surface. The several diagrams represent\r\n  successive stages in the process.]\r\n\r\nSince the marginal plain of the above illustration extends beyond the\r\noriginal shore of the island, the area of land is increased, though\r\nboth its average elevation and its mass (above water) are reduced. In\r\ncase destructive processes did not operate on the marginal graded\r\nplain the spreading and lowering suggested by Figs. 39 and 40 would go\r\non until the central mass of the island was brought down to a gradient\r\nin harmony with that of the gently sloping border, as shown in Fig.\r\n41. When this had been accomplished there would be a relatively large\r\nland area with low slopes (Fig. 41) in place of the smaller area with\r\nsteeper ones (compare Figs. 39 and 40). The basal part of the larger\r\nisland from the center to the original margin would be made up of the\r\noriginal material in its original position (unshaded part of Fig. 41).\r\nIts surface would be covered, least deeply near its center and most\r\ndeeply near the original margin, with débris gradually shifted from\r\nhigher levels, as shown in Fig. 41.\r\n\r\nWere such an island as that shown in Fig. 41 once formed, the rain\r\nfalling on it, and flowing off over its surface, would carry off its\r\nsurface soil and spread it about the shores. Though the surface of the\r\nmarginal flat of Fig. 40 was as low as running water could bring it at\r\nthe time it was developed, the conditions of erosion have changed by\r\nthe time the land reaches the conditions shown in Fig. 41, and the same\r\namount of rainfall may now be effective in erosion. In the first case\r\n(Fig. 40) the water descending from the higher part of the land brought\r\ndown sediment and started across the flat with a load. Its energy was\r\nconsumed in transporting what it had, not in getting new material. In\r\nthe second case (Fig. 41) the water flowing over the gently sloping\r\nsurface has no initial load, and its energy is therefore available for\r\nerosion. Under continued rainfall, the area of the land shown in Fig.\r\n41 would be increased as before by successive marginal deposits (see\r\nFig. 42), and at the same time its average height would be reduced. The\r\nlowering and enlarging of the island would continue until the whole\r\nsurface was brought so nearly to the level of the sea that water would\r\ncease to run over it with sufficient velocity to carry away even the\r\nfine material of its surface. Such a surface, brought down as low as\r\nrunning water can degrade it, is also (see p. 57) a _base-level_. It\r\nwill be seen from the foregoing illustrations that a _graded surface_\r\nmay pass into a _base-level_, with no sharper line of demarkation than\r\nthat which separates a mature man from an old one. In this case, as in\r\nthe preceding, the island has been base-leveled, but still without the\r\nformation of valleys or hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 42.—Diagram to illustrate the result of the\r\n  continuation of the processes shown in Figs. 39–41.]\r\n\r\nBoth the preceding hypothetical cases make it clear that, from the\r\npoint of view of erosion, every drop of water which runs off over\r\nthe surface of the land has for its mission the getting of the land\r\ninto the sea. Under ordinary conditions surface drainage must fail to\r\nbring a land area altogether to sea-level, the absolute base-level of\r\nsubaërial forces; but it is not simply the water which runs off over\r\nthe surface which degrades the land. That which sinks beneath the\r\nsurface contributes to the same end by slowly dissolving mineral matter\r\nbelow the surface, and finally carrying it to the sea. In this way the\r\nreduction of land areas to sea-level may be completed.\r\n\r\nThe rain-water which evaporates from the surface without sinking\r\nbeneath it does not effect much wear; but the water thus evaporated is\r\nsubject to reprecipitation, so that, in the long run, it may assist\r\nin the work which has been sketched. Thus it is not simply the waters\r\nwhich run off over the surface of the land, but all which fall upon it,\r\nwhich unite to compass its destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Development of Valleys._\r\n\r\n=By the growth of gullies.=—Had the slopes of the hypothetical island\r\nnot been absolutely uniform the processes of erosion would have been\r\ndifferent. Let the departure from uniformity be supposed to consist\r\nof a single slight meridional depression near the base of the island\r\n(Fig. 43). As the rain falls it will no longer run off equally in all\r\ndirections. A greater volume will flow through the depression than over\r\nother parts of the surface having the same altitude, and the greater\r\nvolume of water along this line will give greater velocity, greater\r\nvelocity will occasion greater erosion, and greater erosion will deepen\r\nthe depression. The immediate result is a _gully_ or _wash_ (Fig. 44).\r\nSo soon as the gully is started it tends still further to concentrate\r\ndrainage in itself, and is thereby enlarged. The water which enters it\r\nfrom the sides widens it; that which enters at its head lengthens it\r\nby causing its upper end to recede; and all which flows through it, so\r\nlong as its bottom is above base-level, deepens it. The enlarged gully\r\nwill gather more water to itself, and, as before, increased volume\r\nmeans increased velocity, and increased velocity increased erosion. As\r\nthe gully grows, therefore, its increased size becomes the occasion of\r\nstill further enlargement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig 43.+—Diagram showing a slight meridional depression\r\n  in the surface of an otherwise even-sloped island.]\r\n\r\nContinued growth transforms the gully into a ravine, though between a\r\ngully and a ravine there is no distinct line of demarkation. But growth\r\ndoes not stop with ravine-hood. Water from every shower gathers in\r\nthe ravine, and, flowing through it, increases its length, width, and\r\ndepth, until it reaches such proportions that the term _ravine_ is laid\r\naside, as childhood names are, and the depression becomes a valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 44.—Diagram illustrating the development of a\r\n  gully, starting from the condition shown in Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nIt was assumed in the preceding paragraphs that the single depression\r\nin the slope was meridional and low on the slope, but almost any sort\r\nof depression in almost any position would bring about a similar\r\nresult, since it would lead to concentration of the run-off. Had the\r\noriginal surface been interrupted by ridges instead of depressions,\r\nthe effect on valley development would have been much the same, for\r\na ridge, like a depression, would, in almost any position, occasion\r\nthe concentration of the run-off, and so the development of valleys.\r\nUnder the conditions represented in Fig. 44 the lengthening of the\r\ndrainage depression is effected chiefly at its upper end, the head of\r\nthe valley working its way farther and farther back into the land. This\r\nmethod of elongation is known as _head erosion_. But the lengthening\r\nof the valley is not always wholly by head erosion. The gully normally\r\nbegins where concentration of run-off begins, and if this were not at\r\nsea-level, the gully might be lengthening at both ends at the same\r\ntime. This would have been the case, for example, had the original\r\ndepression of Fig. 43 been half-way up the slope of the island.\r\n\r\nIf while the slopes of the island were absolutely uniform its surface\r\nmaterial failed of homogeneity, the result would be much the same as\r\nif the slopes were unequal. If the material lying along a certain\r\nmeridian of the island be slightly softer than that over the rest of\r\nthe surface, the run-off, which would at the outset be equal on all\r\nsides, would effect more erosion along the line of the less resistant\r\nmaterial than elsewhere. The result would be a depression along this\r\nline, and, once started, the depression would be a cause of its own\r\ngrowth. If the soft material were disposed in any way other than\r\nthat indicated, the final result would be much the same, for it\r\nwould quickly give origin to a depression which would lead to the\r\nconcentration of the surface-waters, and this is the condition for the\r\ndevelopment of a gully, a ravine, and finally a valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 45.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of sheet and\r\n  stream erosion on the outline of an island when no deposition takes\r\n  place about its borders. The dotted line represents the original\r\n  outline of the island, the full line its border at a later time. The\r\n  stream develops a reëntrant (bay) in the outline.]\r\n\r\nIn the presence of sufficient rainfall, either heterogeneity of slope\r\nor of material will therefore occasion the development of valleys. If\r\nthe lack of uniformity appears at but a single point there will be but\r\na single valley. If it appears at many points the number of valleys\r\nwill be large. Since it is incredible that a land mass of perfectly\r\nhomogeneous material and of absolutely uniform slopes ever existed,\r\nit is believed that every land mass, affected for any considerable\r\nlength of time by rain, has had valleys developed in it. The degree of\r\nheterogeneity of material and slope is usually so great as to lead to\r\nthe development of many valleys, even on areas which are not large;\r\nbut for the sake of emphasizing the simpler elements of the complex\r\nprocesses of stream work, the hypothetical case of an island with but\r\na single valley, and that without tributaries, may first be studied.\r\nUnder these conditions two cases may be considered, the one where there\r\nis no deposition about the island, and the other where deposition takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n1. If all the material eroded from the surface of such an island, both\r\nin and out of the valley, were carried well beyond the borders of the\r\nland before being deposited, the edge of the island would recede from\r\nits original position toward the center, as illustrated by Figs. 37 and\r\n45; but the recession would be most rapid where the valley joins the\r\nsea (Fig. 45). At this point therefore a reëntrant would be developed\r\n(_a_, Fig. 45), and the island would lose its circular outline.\r\nContinued erosion would cause the shore-line to retreat on all sides,\r\nbut fastest at the lower end of the valley, and the final result would\r\nbe a base-level differing from that developed under the conditions\r\nspecified on p. 60, in that the last part to be brought low would not\r\nbe the center of the original island.\r\n\r\nUnder the foregoing conditions the profile of that part of the valley\r\nwhich is above sea-level (_cb_) would be convex, following the analogy\r\nof sheet erosion on a hypothetical island of uniform slopes and\r\nhomogeneous material with no marginal deposition. Its side slopes,\r\nlikewise developed under the influence of running water augmented in\r\nvolume from top to bottom, would also be convex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 46.—Diagram showing the outline of an island\r\n  as modified by sheet and stream erosion where eroded material is\r\n  deposited at the shore. The dotted line represents the original\r\n  outline; the full line, a later one. The excess of deposition at the\r\n  end of the valley causes a projection of land into the sea.]\r\n\r\n2. If the sediment washed down from the land is deposited about its\r\nborders, both the outline of the island and the profile of the valley\r\nwill be altered. Deposition at the debouchure of the valley follows\r\nthe same principles as deposition elsewhere; but if all the sediment\r\nbrought to the sea be deposited at the shore, the seaward extension of\r\nthe land by deposition would be more rapid opposite the valley than\r\nelsewhere, and the island would lose its circular outline, and develop\r\nsome such form as is shown in Fig. 46. In this case the profile of the\r\nupper end of the valley, and the upper parts of its side slopes, as\r\nwell as the upper parts of the extra-valley slopes of the island, are\r\nconvex (compare Figs. 39 and 40); but the convexity above is exchanged\r\nfor concavity below, the change beginning at the point where downward\r\nerosion of the descending waters is checked. As a valley lengthens, the\r\nlarger part of its profile becomes concave (compare the profiles of\r\nFigs. 39 to 41), but the extreme upper end still remains convex. Since\r\nthe side slopes of a valley are much shorter than its lengthwise slope,\r\na larger proportion remains convex. Under the conditions here discussed\r\nthe change from convexity above to concavity below would begin at about\r\nthe point where deposition begins.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 47.—Diagram representing several meridional\r\n  valleys developing in a circular island. The valleys are all young\r\n  and narrow. All are making deposits at their debouchures.]\r\n\r\nThe deposition at the debouchure of the valley, and later above the\r\ndebouchure, will follow the same course as about the island under the\r\nconditions already discussed (pp. 61, 62).\r\n\r\n=Limits of growth.=—In all cases there are limits in depth, length,\r\nand width, beyond which a valley may not grow. In depth it may reach\r\nbase-level. At the coast, base-level is sea-level,[28] but inland it\r\nrises by a gentle gradient. In length, the valley will grow as long as\r\nits head continues to work inland. In the case represented by Figs.\r\n45 and 46 the head of the valley would not cease to advance when the\r\ncenter of the island was reached, though beyond that point head erosion\r\nwould not be more rapid than lateral erosion on either side. If but\r\na single valley affected a land area the limit toward which it would\r\ntend, and beyond which it could never pass, would be the length of the\r\nland area in the direction of the valley’s axis. In width, a valley is\r\nincreased by the side cutting of the stream, by the wash of the rain\r\nwhich falls on its slopes, and by the action of gravity which tends to\r\ncarry down to the bottom of the slope the material which is loosened\r\nabove by any process whatsoever. If there be but one valley in a land\r\narea its limiting width is scarcely less than the width of the land\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 48.—Same as Fig. 47, with the valleys more\r\n  developed. The dotted line represents the original outline of the\r\n  island. Its area is being extended by deposition everywhere, but most\r\n  at the debouchures of the streams.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 49.—A later stage of the island shown in Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 50.—Diagram to illustrate the lowering of a\r\n  divide without shifting it. The crest of the divide is at _a_, _b_,\r\n  and _c_ successively. If erosion were unequal on the two sides, the\r\n  divide would be shifted.]\r\n\r\nHad there been several initial meridional depressions instead of one\r\nin the island, or had there been several meridional belts where the\r\nmaterial of the surface was less resistant than elsewhere, several\r\nvalleys would have been developed, converging toward the center (Fig.\r\n47). If the conditions were such as to allow of the equal development\r\nof valleys on all sides of the island, each would be lengthened by head\r\nerosion until it reached the center of the island, where the permanent\r\ndivide between their heads would be established. Each would be widened\r\nby all the processes which widen valleys, and their widening would\r\nnarrow the intervening areas (Figs. 48 and 49). Under conditions of\r\nequal erosion the limits of width for each valley would be the centers\r\nof the ridges on either side, and here the divides between them would\r\nbe permanently established. Though erosion would continue even after\r\nthe crest of the ridge had been narrowed to a line, the permanence of\r\nthe divide would follow from the fact that erosion would be equal on\r\nboth sides of this line, and its effect would be to lower the divide,\r\nbut not to shift it horizontally (Fig. 50). The limits in length and\r\nwidth are therefore not the same where there are several valleys as\r\nwhere there is but one. The limit in depth, however, remains the same,\r\nand the final result of erosion, proceeding along these lines, would\r\nbe the base-leveling of the land, leaving a plain but slightly above\r\nsea-level. The plain would not be absolutely flat, though its relief\r\nwould be very slight, and the higher parts would be along the lines of\r\nthe divides between the streams (Fig. 51. Compare also Fig. 42). Many\r\nvalleys would occasion more rapid degradation than few, and the period\r\nof base-leveling would be correspondingly shortened.\r\n\r\nHad the initial depressions which gave origin to the valleys had\r\npositions other than meridional, the valleys would have had other\r\nand less regularly radial courses, but the final result of their\r\ndevelopment would have been the same.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that the method of valley development which\r\nhas been sketched is the only one. The processes of valley development\r\nare complex, and the history of some valleys has run a different\r\ncourse; yet the processes outlined above are in operation in all cases,\r\nand they were probably the most important ones in the development of\r\nthe first drainage system on any land surface. As will be seen in the\r\nsequel the history of valleys is subject to serious accidents, and they\r\nare often of such a nature as to mask the simplicity of the more normal\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 51.—Diagram illustrating the further development\r\n  of Fig. 49. The land here has been reduced greatly, though not yet to\r\n  base-level.]\r\n\r\n_The permanent stream._—From the foregoing discussion, it is seen that\r\na valley may be developed by the run-off of successive showers. If\r\nsupplied only from this source surface streams would cease to flow soon\r\nafter the rain ceased to fall, and a valley might attain considerable\r\nsize without possessing a permanent stream. How does the valley\r\ndeveloped by the run-off of successive showers come to have a permanent\r\nstream? The answer to this question involves a brief consideration of\r\nthat part of the rainfall which sinks beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nIf wells be sunk in a flat region of uniform structure and composition\r\nthe water in them is generally found to stand at a nearly common level.\r\nThe meaning of this fact is not far to seek. If a hole 60 feet deep\r\nfills with water up to a point 20 feet from the surface, it is because\r\nthe material in which the well is sunk is full of water up to that\r\nlevel. When the well is dug the water leaks into it, filling the hole\r\nup to the level to which the rock (or subsoil) is itself full. This\r\nlevel, below which the rock and subsoil (down to unknown depths) are\r\nfull of water, is known as the _ground-water level_, _ground-water\r\nsurface_, or _water-table_.\r\n\r\nThe ground-water level fluctuates. In a wet season it rises, because\r\nmore water has fallen and sunk beneath the soil; but several processes\r\nat once conspire to bring it down again. Where there is growing\r\nvegetation its roots draw up water from beneath, and evaporation also\r\ngoes on independently of vegetation. The water is drawn out through\r\nwells and runs out through openings. It may also flow underground from\r\none region to another where the ground-water surface is lower. All\r\nthese processes depress the ground-water surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 52.—Diagram illustrating the fluctuation of a\r\n  ground-water surface. _a_ = wet-weather ground-water level; _b_ =\r\n  ground-water level during drought. Well No. 1 will contain water\r\n  during the wet season, but will go dry in times of drought. Well No.\r\n  2 will be permanent.]\r\n\r\nA well sunk to such a level as to be supplied with abundant water\r\nin a wet season may go dry during a period of drought because the\r\nground-water level is depressed below its bottom. Thus either well\r\nshown in Fig. 52 will have water during a wet season when the\r\nwater-level is at _a_; but well No. 1 will go dry when the water\r\nsurface is depressed to _b_.\r\n\r\nThe principles applicable to wells are applicable to valleys. When\r\na valley has been deepened until its bottom reaches below the\r\nground-water level, water seeps or flows into it from the sides. The\r\nvalley is then no longer dependent on the run-off of showers for a\r\nstream. It will be readily seen that at some stage in its development,\r\nthe bottom of a valley may be below the ground-water level of a\r\nwet season without being below that of a dry one. Thus the valley\r\nrepresented in cross-section by the line 2–2, in Fig. 53, will have a\r\nstream when the ground-water level is at _aa_, but none when this level\r\nis depressed to _bb_. If the rainfall of the year were concentrated in\r\na single wet season, the intermittent stream would flow not only during\r\nthat season, but for so long a time afterward as the ground-water\r\nlevel remained well above the valley bottom. In regions subject to\r\nfrequent and short periods of heavy precipitation, alternating with\r\ndroughts, the periods of intermittent flow may be many and short.\r\nSince the precipitation of many regions varies greatly from year to\r\nyear, it follows that a stream may flow continuously one year and be\r\nintermittent the next. Many valleys in various parts of the earth are\r\nnow in the stage of development where their streams are intermittent.\r\n\r\nAs a valley containing an intermittent stream becomes deeper, the\r\nperiods when it is dry become shorter, and when it has been sunk below\r\nthe lowest ground-water level, it will have a permanent stream (3, Fig.\r\n53). Since a valley normally develops headward, its lower and older\r\nportion is likely to acquire a permanent stream, while its upper and\r\nyounger part has only an intermittent one (Fig. 47 and Fig. 1, Pl. III,\r\nnear Anthony, Kan. The intermittent part of the stream is indicated\r\nby the dotted blue line). For the same reason the head of a stream is\r\nlikely to be farther up the valley in wet weather than in dry. So soon\r\nas a valley gets a permanent stream, the process of enlargement goes\r\non without the interruption to which it was subject when the supply of\r\nwater was intermittent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.—Diagram to illustrate the intermittency of\r\n  streams due to fluctuations of the ground-water level. The water\r\n  level _aa_ would be depressed next the valley 2–2 by the flow of the\r\n  water into the valley. The profile of the ground-water surface would\r\n  therefore be _aca_ rather than _aa_.]\r\n\r\nIn general a permanent stream at one point in a valley means a\r\ncontinuous stream from that point to the sea or lake which the valley\r\njoins; but to this rule there are many exceptions. They are likely to\r\narise where a stream heads in a region of abundant precipitation, and\r\nflows thence through an arid tract where the ground-water level is low,\r\nand evaporation great. In such cases, evaporation and absorption may\r\ndissipate the water gathered above, and the stream disappears (Fig. 2,\r\nPl. III, near Paradise, Nev.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. KANSAS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. NEVADA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. ILLINOIS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. NORTH DAKOTA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n=Other modes of valley development.=—If as a new area of land emerges\r\nfrom the sea its surface has a depression without an outlet, and\r\nsuch an assumption is by no means improbable, the depression would\r\nbe filled with sea-water. The inflowing water from the surrounding\r\nland might fill the basin to overflowing, and the outflow, finding\r\nexit at the lowest point in the rim of the basin, would flow thence\r\ntoward the sea. Such a stream would develop a valley, the history of\r\nwhich would be somewhat different from that which has been sketched.\r\nInstead of developing headward from the sea, the valley would be in\r\nprocess of excavation all the way from the initial basin to the sea at\r\nthe same time (Fig. 54). The upper end of the valley might ultimately\r\nbe cut to the level of the bottom of the basin, when the lake would\r\ndisappear. The head of the valley might then work back across the\r\nformer site of the lake into the territory beyond. Valleys might have\r\ndeveloped above the lake before it was drained, and after this event,\r\nsuch valleys would make connections with the valley below (Fig. 55). A\r\nvalley developed in this manner is not simply a gully grown big by head\r\nerosion, and the valley would not precede the stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 54.—Diagram to show how a valley may be\r\n  developing all the way from a water-filled basin (lake) to the sea at\r\n  the same time. Small valleys leading to the lake are also developing.\r\n  The black area = the sea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 55.—The stream leading out from the lake (Fig.\r\n  54) has drained the lake, and the valleys above and below the site of\r\n  the former lake have united.]\r\n\r\nIf a surface of land were notably irregular before valleys were\r\ndeveloped in it, there might be many lakes, and the flow from a higher\r\nlake might pass to a lower. If the lakes were ultimately drained, the\r\nseveral sections of the valley would be joined to one another without\r\nintervening basins. In certain regions, especially those which have\r\nbeen affected by continental ice-sheets, this has been a common method\r\nof valley development in _post-glacial_ time. In this case also the\r\nstream precedes its valley, and not the valley its stream. Many\r\npost-glacial valleys, on the other hand, antedated their permanent\r\nstreams, as in the cases first described.\r\n\r\nIf the gradient of a slope on which valleys are to develop is notably\r\nunequal, though without basins, the development of valleys may follow\r\nsomewhat different lines. If on emergence the seaward part of a new\r\nland area assumes the form of a plain, bordered landward by a steeper\r\nslope (Fig. 56), the most notable early growth of the valleys would be\r\non the latter. The run-off would develop gullies on the steep slope,\r\nbut on reaching the plain below the velocity of the water would be\r\nchecked, and it would drop much of the detritus washed down from above.\r\nThis deposition would build up (aggrade) the surface, and much or\r\neven all the water might sink into and seep through the débris thus\r\ndeposited, and disappear altogether from the surface, as at _b_, Fig.\r\n56. This would be most likely to occur where the débris is abundant and\r\ncoarse, and the precipitation slight. If the water disappears at the\r\nbase of the mountain (see Fig. 2, Pl. III), the early growth of the\r\nvalley may be confined to the steep slope remote from the sea (_ab_,\r\nFig. 56); but on the slope where the valley is growing there will be\r\nheadward lengthening, as in the general case already considered. If the\r\nsurface drainage does not disappear at the base of the steep slope, the\r\nrun-off will find its way over the plain along the lowest accessible\r\nroute to the sea (_de_, Fig. 56). In this case the valley may be\r\ngrowing throughout its length at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 56.—Diagram showing the phases of valley\r\n  development described in the text.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 57.—Diagram representing the further development\r\n  of the valleys _fg_ and _hi_ in Fig. 56. The head of the latter (Fig.\r\n  56) has worked back until it has reached the lower end of the former.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions represented by _ab_, Fig. 56, may be no more than\r\ntemporary. Sooner or later a valley developing headward across the\r\nplain (_hi_, Fig. 56) may provide a channel for the water descending\r\nfrom the higher land beyond. In this case the valley develops in\r\nsections, the one on the slope above, the other on the plain below, and\r\ntheir union (compare _fghi_, Fig. 56, with Fig. 57) results from their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe principles here sketched have been in operation wherever land\r\nareas were so elevated as to give rise to unequal slopes, and this has\r\nperhaps been the rule rather than the exception. The results effected\r\nby the operation of these principles would of course be dependent on\r\nthe varieties of slope, on the abruptness with which a slope of one\r\ngradient gave place to another, on the texture of the rock, the amount\r\nand distribution of precipitation, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paragraphs the lengthening of a valley at its upper\r\nend by head erosion has been repeatedly referred to. If all valleys\r\nbegan their development at the sea and lengthened headward, it might\r\nseem that their seaward ends should be their oldest parts; but since\r\nthe development of valleys is begun somewhat promptly after the land\r\nappears above the sea, and since the emergence is generally gradual,\r\nthat part of a valley which is at the seashore at one time may be far\r\ninland a little later, because the land has been extended seaward.\r\nOn an emerging land area therefore the normal growth of a valley\r\ninvolves its lengthening at its lower end as well as at its upper. The\r\nlengthening of a valley, or at least the lengthening of a stream, also\r\ntakes place at its lower end if the land in which it lies is being\r\nextended seaward by deposition.\r\n\r\n=Structural valleys.=—In mountain regions valleys are sometimes formed\r\nby the uplift of parallel mountain folds, leaving a depression between\r\n(Fig. 58). Drainage will appropriate such a valley so that it becomes\r\nin some sense a river valley. But it is not a river valley in the sense\r\nin which the term has been used in the preceding pages. It is rather\r\na _structural valley_. In its bottom a river valley may be developed\r\n(_a_, Fig. 58).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 58.—Structural valley with a river valley\r\n  developing its bottom.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustrations by no means exhaust the list of conditions\r\nunder which valleys develop, but they suffice for the present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 59. +Fig.+ 60.\r\n\r\n  Figures to show why the head of a gully (and therefore a valley)\r\n  departs from a direct course.]\r\n\r\n=The courses of valleys.=—River valleys are rarely straight. To\r\nunderstand why they are crooked it is only necessary to understand the\r\nmethods by which they grow. In so far as a river valley is a gully\r\ngrown big, that is, in so far as its length is the result of head\r\nerosion, its course was determined by the course of the antecedent\r\ngully. If in the case shown in Fig. 59 the slope of the surface above\r\nthe head of the gully is uniform, its material homogeneous, and the\r\nrainfall everywhere equal, more water will come into the gully from\r\nthe direction _a_ than from any other. In this case there would be\r\nmore wear in the direct line of its extension than elsewhere, and the\r\nhead would advance in a straight line. But if there be inequalities of\r\nslope about the head of a gully at any stage of its development more\r\nwater may come in from some direction other than that in the direct\r\nline of its extension. In Fig. 59, for example, more water may enter\r\nfrom the direction of _b_ than from that of _a_. Since most wear is\r\nlikely to be affected along the line of greatest inflow, the head of\r\nthe gully will be turned in that direction (Fig. 60). Started in this\r\ncourse it will continue in the new direction so long as erosion in this\r\nline is greater than that elsewhere; but whenever the configuration\r\nof the surface causes more water to enter the head of the gully from\r\nsome direction other than that in which it is headed, the line of\r\naxial growth is again changed, as toward _c_, Fig. 60. Since new land\r\nsurfaces are probably more or less undulatory, crookedness should be\r\nthe rule among valleys developed from gullies by head erosion. Streams\r\nand valleys the courses of which are determined by the original slope\r\nof the land are said to be _consequent_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 61.—Diagram illustrating the development of two\r\n  equal gullies from the head of one.]\r\n\r\nInequalities of material, leading to unequal rates of erosion, effect\r\nthe same result, in the absence of inequalities of slope. If at any\r\nstage of a valley’s development erosion were equal in two directions\r\nat its head, and at the same time greater than at points between, two\r\ngullies would result (Fig. 61) diverging from the point in question.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a valley developed by overflow from a lake its course is\r\ndetermined by the lowest line of flow to which the water has access. If\r\nthis line be straight the valley will be straight; if it is crooked, as\r\nit generally is, the valley is crooked also.\r\n\r\n=The development of tributaries.=—Thus far valleys leading\r\nimmediately to the sea have been considered, and no account taken\r\nof tributaries. As a matter of fact most considerable valleys have\r\nnumerous tributaries. It is now in order to inquire into their mode of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSo soon as a gully is started, the water flowing into it from either\r\nside wears back the slopes. The least inequality of slope, or the least\r\nvariation in the character of the material, is sufficient to make the\r\nlateral erosion unequal at different points, and unequal erosion in\r\nthe slopes results in the development of tributary gullies. The oldest\r\ntributaries may be nearly as old as the main which they join, and from\r\nwhich they developed, for the possibilities of unequal side erosion\r\nexist as soon as a gully is opened. While the main gully is developing\r\ninto a ravine, and the ravine into a valley, the tributary gullies\r\nare likewise developing into maturer stages. Tributary to a young\r\nvalley, therefore, there may be gullies near its head, ravines in its\r\nmiddle course, and small valleys along its oldest portion. It is not\r\nto be understood, however, that the oldest tributaries are necessarily\r\nthe largest, for because of more favorable conditions for growth the\r\nyounger tributaries often outstrip the older.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 62.—Diagram to illustrate the oblique position\r\n  of a tributary gully at its inception, and its later normal change of\r\n  direction.]\r\n\r\nThe position of tributaries with reference to their mains is worthy\r\nof note. The water flowing down a slope follows the line of steepest\r\ndescent. A gully is usually wider at its lower end, and narrower at its\r\nupper. Wherever this is true the line of steepest descent down its side\r\nis not a line perpendicular to its axis, but a line slightly oblique\r\nto it (_ef_, Fig. 62), and oblique in such a direction that it meets\r\nthe axis with an obtuse angle below and an acute angle above. It is in\r\nthe direction corresponding to this line that tributary gullies tend\r\nto develop. Thus at the inception of its history a tributary gully is\r\nlikely to join its main with an angle slightly acute on the up-stream\r\nside. If the tributary did not begin until after its main was farther\r\nadvanced this tendency would be less and less pronounced. Inequalities\r\nof material or slope would often counteract this tendency, which, at\r\nbest, would cause the courses of tributaries to depart but little from\r\nperpendicularity to their mains.\r\n\r\nAfter the head of a tributary has worked back from the immediate slope\r\nof its main every condition which determines the course of a gully\r\nis likely to affect it, and it is by no means certain that it will\r\ncontinue to lengthen in the direction in which it started. Since the\r\ngeneral slope of the surface into which the tributary works is likely\r\nto be seaward, more water is likely to enter from the landward than\r\nfrom the seaward side of its head, so that, except where there are\r\nnotable irregularities of slope, its tendency will be to turn more and\r\nmore toward the direction of its main (_efg_, Fig. 62).\r\n\r\nIn depth the tributary is always limited by its main. The principles\r\nwhich determine the length and width of a main valley determine also\r\nthe length and width of a tributary (see p. 67 et seq.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A CYCLE OF EROSION. ITS STAGES.\r\n\r\nFrom what has preceded it is clear that the topography of a region\r\nundergoing erosion will change greatly from time to time. The first\r\neffect of erosion is to roughen the surface by cutting out valleys,\r\nleaving ridges and hills. The final effect is to make it smooth again\r\nby cutting the ridges and hills down to the level of the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe base-level of erosion has already been defined; but the mode of\r\nits development may now be illustrated in the light of the preceding\r\ndiscussion. Suppose a land surface affected by a series of parallel\r\nyoung valleys without tributaries (Fig. 63). Between them there is\r\na series of upland plateaus. The profile of the surface between two\r\nadjacent valleys is represented in section by the uppermost line in\r\nFig. 64. As the valleys are widened from 1–1 and 1,′-1′, to 2–2 and\r\n2′-2′, the intervening plateau is correspondingly narrowed. When\r\nthe valleys have attained the form represented by 3–3 and 3′-3′,\r\nthe intervening upland has been narrowed to a ridge, _a_, and the\r\nvalley flats have become wide. With continued erosion the ridge\r\nwill be lowered (to _b_ and below), and in time the surface will\r\napproach a plain. In this condition it is known as a _peneplain_ (an\r\n“almost-plain”). Finally, when running water has done its utmost,\r\nthe ridges will be essentially obliterated and a base-leveled plain\r\n(_e_, _e′_, _e″_) results. The figure expresses the fact that the\r\nbase-level develops laterally from the axis of the valley. It also\r\ndevelops headward from the seaward end of the valley. Similarly, taking\r\ninto account all the valleys which affect it, the seaward margin of a\r\nbase-leveled plain is developed first, and thence it extends itself\r\ninland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 63.—Diagram showing three parallel valleys in a\r\n  land surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 64.—Diagram to illustrate the lowering of the\r\n  surface by valley erosion. The successive cross profiles of the\r\n  valleys are represented by the lines 1–1, 1–1′, 2–2, 2–2′, etc.]\r\n\r\nTributaries are tolerably sure to develop along each main valley. The\r\nheads of the tributaries work back across the uplands between the main\r\nvalleys, dissecting them into secondary ridges (Fig. 65). Tributaries\r\nwill develop on the tributaries, and these tertiary valleys dissect\r\nthe secondary ridges into those of a lower order. This process of\r\ntributary development goes on until drainage lines of the fourth,\r\nfifth, sixth, and higher orders are formed (Fig. 66). Since the process\r\nof valley development under such circumstances is also the process\r\nof ridge dissection, a stage is presently reached where the ridges\r\nare cut into such short sections that they cease to be ridges, and\r\nbecome hills instead. Even then the processes of erosion do not stop,\r\nfor the rain-water falling on the hills washes the loose material\r\nfrom their surfaces, and starts it on its seaward journey. Thus the\r\n“everlasting hills” themselves are lowered, and, given time enough,\r\nwill be carried to the sea. Under these conditions, as under those\r\nalready discussed, the final result of stream erosion is the reduction\r\nof the land to base-level. The base-leveled surface, as before, would\r\nnot be absolutely flat. The area reduced by each stream will have a\r\nslight gradient down-stream, and from each lateral divide toward the\r\naxis of the valley. The crests of the scarcely perceptible elevations\r\nwhich remain will be in the position of the former divides, and these\r\nwill be highest where most distant from the sea by the course which\r\nthis part of the drainage took. Even the insensible divides between\r\nstreams flowing in a common direction may disappear, for when valleys\r\nhave reached their limits in depth, their streams do not cease to cut\r\nlaterally. Meandering in their flat-bottomed valleys, they often reach\r\nand undercut the divides (Pl. VII), whether they be high or low. By\r\n_lateral planation_, therefore, the divides between streams may be\r\nentirely eaten away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 65.—Diagram showing the dissection of the upland\r\n  shown in Fig. 64 by tributary valleys.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 66.—Diagram showing tributaries of several orders\r\n  developed from the conditions sketched in the text.]\r\n\r\nIt has now been seen that by whatever method erosion by running water\r\nproceeds, whether there be many valleys, or few or none, the final\r\nresult of subaërial erosion must be the production of a base-level. It\r\nhas also been seen that the base-level is first developed at the lower\r\nends of the main streams, and that it extends itself systematically\r\nup the main valleys and up all tributaries. The time involved in the\r\nreduction of a land area to base-level is a _cycle of erosion_.\r\n\r\nIt will have been evident from the preceding pages that the terms\r\n“grade,” “graded plain,” and “base-level” and “base-leveled plain,”\r\nare somewhat variously, and therefore somewhat confusingly, used.\r\n“Grade is a condition of essential balance between corrasion and\r\ndeposition.”[29] A graded valley is one in which deposition and\r\ncorrasion are, in the vertical sense, balanced. Its angle of slope is\r\nmost variable, and is dependent on the capacity of the stream for work,\r\nand on the work it has to do. A weak river must have a higher gradient\r\nthan a strong one; a stream with much sediment must have a higher\r\ngradient than one with little, and a stream with a load of coarse\r\nmaterial must have a higher gradient than one with a load of fine.\r\nThus the graded valley of the lower Mississippi has an inappreciable\r\nangle of slope, but the graded valleys of many of its tributaries have\r\nslopes of hundreds of feet per mile. Since both the size of the stream\r\nand the amount and coarseness of its load at a given place vary from\r\ntime to time, it is clear that the inclination of a graded valley\r\nmust vary also, and further, that it must be in process of continual\r\nreadjustment. With the changing conditions of advancing years the slope\r\nof a graded valley normally decreases. The same principles apply to\r\ngraded surfaces outside of valleys.\r\n\r\nIn the continual readjustment of grades incident to a river’s normal\r\nhistory the land is brought nearer and nearer to sea-level without\r\nceasing to be at grade. When the inclination of a graded surface\r\nbecomes so low that it is sensibly flat, the surface may be said to be\r\nat _base-level_, although this does not mean that the surface can never\r\nbe degraded further. If the term be used in this way, it is clear that\r\nthere is no sharp line of distinction between a graded surface and a\r\nbase-leveled surface, and as the terms are now commonly applied no such\r\ndistinction exists.\r\n\r\nIf the term base-level were made synonymous with sea-level, as has\r\nbeen proposed,[30] the term might as well be discarded, for sea-level\r\ncould always be used in its stead. Furthermore, streams often erode\r\nbelow sea-level. The bottom of the channel of the Mississippi is below\r\nsea-level for some 400 miles above its debouchure, and locally (Fort\r\nJackson) it is nearly 250 feet below. This deep channel is the result\r\nof the erosive activity of the stream, not of subsidence. Again, the\r\nsea-level is itself inconstant. The extent of its changes cannot now be\r\nmeasured, but they have probably been more considerable in the course\r\nof geological history than has been commonly recognized. It is true\r\nthat they take place slowly, as far as known, but it is also true that\r\nthe duration of an erosion cycle is sufficiently long for even very\r\nslow changes to reach great magnitude. The sea-level, therefore, can\r\nhardly be accepted as the absolute base-level, unless (1) the absolute\r\nbase-level is a variable, and unless (2) the absolute base-level be a\r\nsurface below which rivers may cut to the extent of at least 250 feet.\r\n\r\nThe ocean may be looked upon as a barrier which in a general way limits\r\nthe down-cutting of running water; for only very large streams cut much\r\nbelow its level. Other barriers, such as lakes, and the outcrops of\r\nhard rock in a stream’s bed, have a comparable, though more temporary,\r\neffect on the development of valley plains above. Plains thus developed\r\nhave been called _temporary base-levels_. They differ from other graded\r\nplains in being controlled primarily by a barrier below, rather than by\r\nconditions which exist above.\r\n\r\nSince river valleys have a beginning and pass through various stages\r\nof development before the country they drain is base-leveled, it\r\nis important to recognize their various stages of advancement. Nor\r\nis this difficult. An old valley and a young one have different\r\ncharacteristics, and the one would no more be mistaken for the other by\r\nthose who have learned to interpret them, than the face of an aged man\r\nwould be mistaken for that of a child.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 67.—A gully developed by a single shower.\r\n  (Blackwelder.)]\r\n\r\nThe cycle begins with the beginning of valley development, and at that\r\nstage drainage is in its _infancy_. The type of the infant valley is\r\nthe gully or ravine (Figs. 67 and 68). It has steep slopes and a\r\nnarrow bottom. Fig. 1 of Plate IV represents similar, or rather older,\r\nravines in contour (shore of Lake Michigan, just north of Chicago).\r\nWith age, the valley widens, lengthens, and deepens, and passes from\r\ninfancy to _youth_. In this stage also the valleys are relatively\r\nnarrow, and the divides between them broad. They may be deep or\r\nshallow, according to the height of the land in which they are cut, and\r\nthe fall of the water flowing through them; but in any case the streams\r\nflowing through them have done but a small part of the work they are\r\nto do before the country they drain is base-leveled. Figs. 69 and 70,\r\nrespectively, represent youthful valleys in regions of moderate and\r\ngreat relief. Fig. 2, Plate IV, shows a youthful valley in a region of\r\nslight relief (near Casselton, N. D., lat. 46° 40′, long. 97° 25′). The\r\nuppermost line in Fig. 64 likewise represents topographic youth, as\r\nshown in cross-profile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 68.—A gully somewhat older than that shown in\r\n  Fig. 67. (Alden.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 69.—A young valley in a region of slight relief.]\r\n\r\nNot only are narrow valleys said to be young, but the territory\r\naffected by them is said to be in its topographic youth, since but\r\na small part of the time necessary to reduce it to base-level has\r\nelapsed. An area is in its topographic youth when considerable portions\r\nof it are still unaffected by valleys. Thus the areas (as a whole), as\r\nwell as the valleys, represented on Plate IV, are in their topographic\r\nyouth. It is often convenient to recognize various sub-stages, such\r\nas early, middle, and late, within the youthful stage of valleys or\r\ntopographies. The different parts of the areas shown on Plate IV, for\r\nexample, represent different stages of youth.\r\n\r\nYouthful streams, as well as youthful topographies, have their\r\ndistinctive characteristics. They are usually swift; their cutting is\r\nmainly at the bottom rather than at the sides, and their courses are\r\noften marked by rapids and falls.\r\n\r\nAs valleys approach base-level they develop flats. As the valleys and\r\ntheir flats widen, and as their tributaries increase in numbers and\r\nsize, a stage of erosion is presently reached where but little of the\r\noriginal upland surface remains. The country is largely reduced to\r\nslopes. In this condition the drainage and the topography which it\r\nhas determined are said to be _mature_. Mature topography is shown in\r\ncontours in the figures of Plate V, and in the northern part of Plate\r\nVI, where slopes, rather than upland or valley flats, predominate.\r\nFig. 1 of Plate V represents an area in southeastern Kentucky (lat.\r\n37° 12′, long. 83° 10′); Fig. 2, an area in western Virginia. Plate\r\nVI represents an area in southern California, somewhat west of San\r\nBernardino. The three areas are alike in representing mature drainage,\r\nthough not of equal stages of advancement. The striking differences\r\nof topography of the three areas are the result of differences in\r\nrock structure and altitude, and will be considered later. Mature\r\ntopography is also shown in Fig. 71, where the relief is moderate,\r\nand in Figs. 72 and 73, where it is great. Figs. 72 and 73 illustrate\r\nclearly the universal tendency of rivers in regions of notable relief\r\nto develop new flats well below the old surface of the region. At the\r\nsame time that these low-lying flats are developing, tributary drainage\r\nis dissecting and roughening the upper surfaces. This process is well\r\nshown in Fig. 73. In both Figs. 72 and 73 the summits of the mountains\r\non either side of the valleys appear to have had about the same\r\nelevation. The new flat is therefore developed at the expense of the\r\nold flat. As will be seen in the sequel, the first flat which a stream\r\ndevelops along its course is usually somewhat above base-level. It is a\r\n_graded_ flat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. KENTUCKY.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. VIRGINIA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n  PARTS OF LOS ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES, CALIFORNIA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 70.—The valley (canyon) of the Yellowstone. A\r\n  young valley in an elevated region.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 71.—Mature erosion topography in a region of\r\n  slight relief, Iowa. (Calvin.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 72.—Mature erosion in a mountain region. From\r\n  mouth of Gray Copper Gulch, Silverton, Colo., quadrangle. (Cross,\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe same processes which have made young valleys mature will in time\r\nwork further changes. When the gradients of the valleys have become low\r\nand their bottoms wide, and when the intervening ridges and hills have\r\nbecome narrow and small, the drainage and the drainage topography have\r\nreached _old age_, and the streams are in a condition of senility. This\r\nis illustrated by Fig. 1, Plate VII (central Kansas), and in section\r\nby the third and lower lines in Fig. 64. Topographic old age sometimes\r\nhas a different expression; this is shown in Fig. 74, where most of\r\nthe surface has been brought low. The elevations which rise above the\r\ngeneral plain are small in area, but have abrupt slopes. This phase\r\nof old-age topography is usually the result of the unequal resistance\r\nof the rock degraded. The effects of unequal rock-resistance will be\r\nconsidered later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 73.—Mature erosion in a mountain region.\r\n  Silverton, Colo. (Cross, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe marks of old streams are as characteristic as those of young\r\nones. They have low gradients and are sluggish. Instead of lowering\r\ntheir channels steadily they cut them down in flood, and fill them up\r\nwhen their currents are not swollen. They meander widely in their\r\nflat-bottomed valleys (Fig. 1, Pl. VII, Central Kansas) and their\r\nerosion, except in time of flood, is largely lateral.\r\n\r\nIf the processes of degradation were to continue until the land\r\nsurface was brought to sea-level, and this might be done by solution\r\nthough not by mechanical erosion of running water, the rivers would no\r\nlonger flow, and the drainage system would have reached the end of its\r\nhistory—_death_.\r\n\r\nNot only do valleys normally pass from birth to youth, from youth to\r\nmaturity, and from maturity to old age, but a single river system\r\nmay show these various stages of development in its various parts.\r\nThus in the area shown in Fig. 2, Plate VII (north central Kansas),\r\nthere is a tract (extreme southwest) where the erosion history is\r\nscarcely begun. The zone of land a little farther northeast, and just\r\nreached by the heads of the valleys (same figure), is in its youth.\r\nThe well-drained and uneven tract southwest of the flat of the Solomon\r\nRiver is in maturity, while the flat of the main valley has the general\r\ncharacteristics of old age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 74.—A peneplained surface where the elevations\r\n  are small but steep-sided. Near Camp Douglas, Wis. (Atwood.)]\r\n\r\nThe age of valleys in terms of erosion is also expressed more or\r\nless perfectly by their cross-sections. The line 1–1 (and 1′-1′) of\r\nFig. 64 represents in cross-section a narrow V-shaped valley. Such a\r\nsection is always indicative of youth. The stream which developed it\r\ncut chiefly at its bottom, not at its sides. It was therefore rapid,\r\nand rapid streams are young. The line 2–2, (2′-2′) (Fig. 64) shows\r\nthe same valley at a later and maturer stage when downward cutting\r\nhas nearly ceased. The widening of the valley by slope wash has\r\nbecome relatively more important than before, and the stream has so far\r\nlost velocity as the result of diminished gradient as to be unable to\r\ncarry away all the detritus washed down from the sides. As a result of\r\ndeposition at the bases of the side slopes, a concave curve has been\r\ndeveloped. Up the valley from the point where such a section as is\r\nrepresented by 2–2 occurs, the valley may still have a section similar\r\nto that represented by 1–1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. KANSAS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. KANSAS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n  ABOUT 15 MILES SOUTHWEST OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\nStill later stages of development are represented by the cross-sections\r\n3–3 and 4–4. Not only has the valley become larger, but the stream\r\nhas deposited detritus (not shown in the figure) in the bottom of its\r\nvalley, developing an alluvial flat. On this flat the stream meanders,\r\nand the valley may be widened by the undercutting of the bluffs\r\nwherever the stream in its wanderings reaches them (Pl. VIII, near\r\nSt. Louis). A valley might possess the characteristics shown by the\r\ncross-sections 3–3, 2–2, and 1–1, Fig. 64, in its lower, middle, and\r\nupper courses, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe preceding discussion, and the illustrations which accompany it,\r\ngive some idea of the topography which characterizes an area in various\r\nstages of its erosion history. Whether the valleys are deep or shallow,\r\nand the intervening ridges high or low, depends on the original height\r\nof the land and its distance from the sea. The higher the land, and the\r\nnearer it is to the sea, the greater the relief developed by erosion. A\r\nplateau near the sea may become mountainous in the mature stage of its\r\nerosion history, while a plain in the same situation would only become\r\nhilly. A plateau in the heart of a continent would have less relief\r\nin its maturity than one of equal elevation near the sea, since the\r\ngrade-plain in the former position is higher than in the latter. Plates\r\nIV and IX show youthful topography where the relief is relatively\r\nslight, and Plate X shows youthful topography where the relief is\r\ngreat. Similarly, Plates V and VI show mature topography where the\r\nrelief is great, and Fig. 1, Plate III, shows mature topography where\r\nthe relief is relatively slight.\r\n\r\nTopographic youth, topographic maturity, and topographic old age\r\nare also indicated in other ways, and especially by the presence of\r\nfeatures which rivers tend to destroy. If, for example, the surface\r\nof the land, well above the valley bottoms, is marked by numerous\r\nponds and marshes, it is clear that drainage has not yet progressed\r\nbeyond its early stages, for, unless the lakes be very deep, valleys\r\nworking back into the land will find and drain them before topographic\r\nmaturity has been reached. Their presence is evidence that the region\r\nwhere they occur has not yet been thoroughly dissected by erosion\r\nlines, and therefore has not reached maturity. Still other marks of\r\ntopographic youth, such as rapids, falls, etc., as well as marks of\r\ntopographic maturity and old age, will be mentioned in the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TOPOGRAPHIES DEVELOPED BY RIVER EROSION.\r\n\r\nWith the characteristics of river valleys and the methods by which\r\nthey grow clearly in mind it is easy to say whether rivers have been\r\nthe chief agents in the development of a given topography. River\r\nvalleys are distinguished from other depressions on land surfaces by\r\ntheir linear form and, leaving out of consideration the relatively\r\ninsignificant inequalities in a stream’s channel, by the fact that any\r\npoint in the bottom of a river valley is lower than any other point\r\nfarther up the stream in the same valley, and higher than any point\r\nfarther down the stream. The second point might be otherwise stated\r\nby saying that every valley excavated by erosion leads to a lower\r\nvalley, or to the sea, or an inland basin. Streams which dry up, or\r\notherwise disappear as they flow, constitute partial exceptions. If,\r\ntherefore, the depressions on a land surface are linear, lead to other\r\nand deeper valleys, and finally to an inland basin, or the sea, and\r\nif the elevations between these valleys are such as might have been\r\nleft by the excavation of the valleys, it is generally clear that\r\nrain and rivers have been the chief factors in the development of\r\nthe topography. If, on the other hand, a surface is characterized by\r\ntopographic features which streams cannot develop, such as enclosed\r\ndepressions, or hills and ridges whose arrangement is independent of\r\ndrainage lines, other agents besides rain and surface streams have been\r\nconcerned in its development.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPECIAL FEATURES RESULTING FROM SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF EROSION.\r\n\r\nMany striking topographic and scenic features result from rain and\r\nriver erosion. Some of them depend primarily on the conditions of\r\nerosion, such as climate, altitude, etc., while others depend largely\r\non the structure and resistance of the rock. Between these two classes\r\nthere is no sharp line of demarkation. Illustrations of two types,\r\ndependent largely but by no means wholly on conditions independent of\r\nthe rock, are cited at this point. Others will be mentioned in other\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\n=Bad-land topography.=—To a type of topography developed in early\r\nmaturity in certain high regions where the rock is but slightly, though\r\nunequally, resistant, a special name is sometimes given. Such regions\r\nare termed _bad lands_. Some idea of bad-land topography is gained from\r\nFigs. 75 to 78. Bad-land topography is found in various localities\r\nin the West, but especially in western Nebraska and Wyoming, and the\r\nwestern parts of the Dakotas. The formations here are often beds of\r\nsandstone or shale, alternating with unindurated beds of clay. Climatic\r\nfactors are also concerned in the development of bad-land topography. A\r\nsemi-arid climate, where the precipitation is much concentrated, seems\r\nto be most favorable for its development. The bad-land topography is\r\nmost striking in early maturity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 75.—Bad-land topography. North of Scott’s Bluff,\r\n  Neb. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 76.—Toadstool Park, Sioux Co., Neb. The peculiar\r\n  topography is the result of erosion working on jointed rocks of\r\n  unequal hardness in an arid region of considerable elevation where\r\n  rainfall is unequally distributed. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Special forms of valleys; canyons.=—Various conditions influence the\r\nsize and shape of valleys, especially in the early stage of their\r\ndevelopment. If the altitude of the land be great, the gradient of\r\nthe streams at this stage will be high. A high gradient means a\r\nswift stream, and a swift stream erodes chiefly at its bottom. High\r\naltitudes therefore favor the development of deep valleys. Such valleys\r\nwill be narrow if the conditions which determine widening are absent\r\nor unfavorable. Since slope wash is one of the main factors in the\r\nwidening of valleys, an arid climate favors the development of narrow\r\nvalleys, if there be sufficient water to maintain a vigorous stream.\r\nNarrowness and steepness of slopes will also be favored if the valley\r\nis cut in rock which is capable of standing with steep faces. Thus\r\na stream may develop a narrow valley in indurated rock where it\r\nwould not do so in loose gravel, and, other things being equal, it\r\nwill develop a narrower valley in rock which is horizontally bedded\r\nthan in rock the beds of which are inclined. Aridity, high altitude,\r\nand the proper sort of rock structure therefore favor the development\r\nof canyons, and many of the young valleys in the western part of the\r\nUnited States where these conditions prevail, belong to this class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 77.—Detail of bad-land topography.

(Peabody.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 81.—Diagram showing the relations of depth and\r\n  width of a valley, the width of which is eight times the depth.]\r\n\r\nWhile all canyons are valleys, most valleys are not canyons. The\r\ndistinction between a canyon and a valley which is not a canyon is not\r\nsharp. The canyon depends for its distinctive character on the relation\r\nof depth, width, and angle of slope to one another; but any definition\r\nof the depth, width, and angle of slope necessary to constitute a\r\nvalley a canyon is arbitrary.[31] In popular usage the rule seems to\r\nbe that if a valley is sufficiently deep, narrow, and steep-sided to\r\nbe distinctly striking, it is called a canyon in regions where that\r\nterm is in use. Whether a valley is deep, narrow, and steep-sided\r\nenough to be striking clearly depends on the observer. The Colorado\r\nCanyon (Figs. 79 and 80) is the greatest canyon known, but it is rarely\r\nmore than a mile deep, and where its depth approaches this figure it\r\nis often eight, ten, or even twelve miles wide from rim to rim. Its\r\nwidth at bottom is little more than the width of the stream; that is,\r\na few hundred feet. Its cross-profile throughout much of its course\r\nis therefore not in keeping with the conventional idea of a canyon.\r\nWith a depth of one mile and a width of eight, the slope, if uniform,\r\nwould have an angle of less than 15°. Such a valley is represented in\r\nFig. 81. As a matter of fact the slopes of a canyon are not commonly\r\nuniform. The slopes represented in Fig. 82 correspond more nearly than\r\nthose of Fig. 81, to the actual slopes of the Colorado Canyon. The\r\ninequalities of slope are occasioned by the inequalities of hardness.\r\nIt is perhaps needless to say that to an observer on the rim of the\r\ncanyon the slopes seem several times as steep as those shown in the\r\ndiagrams.\r\n\r\nLike all valleys which are narrow relative to their depth, the Colorado\r\nCanyon, great as it is, is a young valley; for it represents but a\r\nsmall part of the work which the stream must do to bring its drainage\r\nbasin to base-level.\r\n\r\nWhile aridity and altitude are conditions which favor the development\r\nof canyons, as shown by the fact that most canyons are high and dry\r\nregions, they are not indispensable. Niagara River has a canyon below\r\nits falls (Pl. IX), and the surrounding region is neither high nor\r\narid. The narrow part of the valley has been developed by the recession\r\nof the falls, and is so young that side erosion has not yet widened the\r\nvalley or lowered its angle of slope to such an extent as to destroy\r\nits canyon character. This canyon is often called a _gorge_, a term\r\nfrequently applied to small valleys of the canyon type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 82.—Cross-section of the Colorado Canyon. (After\r\n  Gilbert and Brigham.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 83.—Detail of erosion in the Grand Canyon.\r\n  The inequalities of slope are the result of unequal hardness. The\r\n  vertical planes which give the architectural effect are the result of\r\n  joints. (Holmes.)]\r\n\r\nPlate X shows portions of the canyons of the Yellowstone and the\r\nColorado rivers respectively. In the first the contour interval is 100\r\nfeet, and in the second, 250 feet. The horizontal scale is ¹⁄₁₂₅₀₀₀\r\n(about 2 miles to the inch) in the first, and ¹⁄₂₅₀₀₀₀ in the second.\r\nThese scales should be borne in mind in interpreting the map.\r\n\r\nFalls, rapids, narrows, and other peculiar features, due primarily to\r\ninequalities in the hardness of the rock affected by erosion, will be\r\nconsidered later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 84.—A surface illustrating the struggle for\r\n  existence among gullies.

Surv.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AMONG VALLEYS AND STREAMS.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that every gully becomes a valley, nor that\r\nevery small valley becomes a large one. Among valleys, as among living\r\nthings, there is a struggle for existence, and fitness determines\r\ngrowth and survival. At an early stage of its erosion history the\r\nnumber of small valleys in a given area is often great, while at a\r\nlater stage the number is less and the size of the survivors greater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n  NIAGARA FALLS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. YELLOWSTONE PARK.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. ARIZONA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 85.—Diagram illustrating the absorption of one\r\n  gully by another by lateral erosion. The successive lines represent\r\n  successive cross-sections.]\r\n\r\nOne phase of the struggle for existence is often well illustrated\r\non a freshly exposed slope of clay. The number of miniature gullies\r\nwhich develop on such a slope, even in a single shower, may be very\r\nlarge (Fig. 84); but the history of many of them is ephemeral. If two\r\nadjacent ones are of unequal depth the widening of the deeper narrows\r\nand finally eliminates the divide between them, and the two become one\r\n(Fig. 85).\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the struggle for existence is shown in other\r\nsituations. Examination of a good map of the north shore of Lake\r\nSuperior or the west shore of Lake Michigan shows a large number of\r\nsmall streams and gullies (Fig. 1, Pl. IV). The valleys are short and\r\nnarrow, and between and beyond them are considerable areas untouched by\r\nerosion. The drainage near the lake is therefore young, and each of the\r\nsmall valleys is growing. This condition of things is perhaps typical\r\nof that which has been, is, or will be along the average coast at a\r\ncertain stage in its erosion history. No equal stretch of coast-line\r\nwhere erosion is far advanced can boast of a number of large rivers\r\ncomparable to that of the many small ones along the coasts mentioned.\r\nIt therefore seems evident that of these many small streams a few only\r\nwill attain considerable size.\r\n\r\nSome of the methods by which the growth of the many is arrested\r\nare easily understood. Some of the young valleys on a given coast\r\nwill work their heads back into the land faster than others because\r\nof inequalities of slope and material. This will be true of the\r\ntributaries no less than of their mains. If valleys develop in ways\r\nother than by head erosion (see p. 73) the chances are also against\r\ntheir equality of growth. If two streams, such as _a_ and _c_, Fig.\r\n86, develop faster than the intermediate stream _b_, it is clear that\r\ntheir tributaries may work back into the territory which at the outset\r\ndrained into _b_, so as to cut off the supply of water from the latter\r\nstream (compare _a′b′c′_, Fig. 87). As a result, the growth of _b_\r\nwill be checked, and ultimately stopped. Similarly other valleys,\r\nsuch as _f_, will get the better of their neighbors, and many of the\r\ncompetitors, as _b_, _d_, _e_, and _g_ will soon drop out of the\r\nrace. Between the stronger streams competition still goes on. If _a′_\r\nand _f′_ develop faster than _c′_ its prospective drainage territory\r\nwill be preëmpted by its rivals (compare Figs. 87 and 88). Thus as\r\nthe result of the unequal rate at which valleys are lengthened, the\r\nlarger number of those which come into existence are arrested in their\r\ndevelopment. As a result of growth in the manner indicated, the basins\r\nof even the large streams remain narrow at their lower ends while\r\nthey expand above. This is the usual form of a drainage basin the\r\ndevelopment of which has been normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 86–88.—Diagrams to illustrate successive stages\r\n  in the struggle for existence and dominion among streams.]\r\n\r\nDid valleys grow in length only, competition would not destroy the\r\nsmall ones; it would simply limit them. But valleys widen as well as\r\nlengthen, and by widening, adjacent valleys may eliminate the divide\r\nbetween them and become one. The elimination of the intervening ridge\r\nmay be by lateral planation (p. 82), or, if the valleys be of unequal\r\ndepth, by slope wash (see Fig. 85). By these and other processes many\r\nyoung valleys are dwarfed, and many others are destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Piracy.=—Streams do not always hold the courses which they establish\r\nfor themselves at the outset. If the valley occupied by the stream _a_,\r\nFig. 89, is deepened more rapidly than the valley occupied by _b_, a\r\ntributary from the former, _c_, may work back across the inter-stream\r\narea to e and steal the head waters of that stream (Fig. 90). The\r\ntributary which does the stealing is known as a _pirate_. Stream _f_\r\n(Fig. 90) is said to be _beheaded_, and its upper portion, _de_,\r\ndiverted. The beheaded stream is diminished in volume; or if its total\r\nsupply of water came in above the point of tapping it would disappear\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 89 and 90.—Diagrams to illustrate piracy.]\r\n\r\nThe process may not end even here. If after the diversion of _de_ the\r\npoint in the channel to the left is lowered faster than the channel of\r\nthe beheaded stream _f_, the divide between _dg_ and the head of _f_\r\n(Fig. 90) will be shifted down the valley of the latter, as shown in\r\nFig. 91. The shifting will go on until the divide reaches a position of\r\nstability, that is, until erosion on its opposite sides is equal.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing case may be called _foreign piracy_ because the valleys\r\nof different systems are concerned. _Domestic piracy_ may also take\r\nplace, as illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (Figs. 92 and 93).\r\nHere a tributary to a crooked river may develop, working back until\r\nit taps the main at a higher point, thus straightening the course of\r\nthe stream. The change takes place only when the highest point in the\r\ntributary valley is brought below the surface of the water in the main\r\nstream at the point where the tapping takes place. This would be likely\r\nto occur only after the main stream had attained a low gradient, for so\r\nlong as it is deepening its channel notably, the small amount of water\r\nflowing through the tributary valley would not be likely to bring it\r\ndown to the level of the main. In any case the flow of water from the\r\nmain stream through the new valley would be likely to be started during\r\nflood, and at such time the erosion in the new channel would be great.\r\nThe complete and final diversion of the stream through the new channel\r\nmight be a slow process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 91.—Diagram showing the shifting of a divide\r\n  after piracy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 92 and 93.—Domestic piracy. The tributary, _a_\r\n  of Fig. 92, develops headward until it taps the main stream at _b_,\r\n  giving the result shown in Fig. 93.]\r\n\r\nPiracy may occur where the material in which the valleys are cut is\r\nhomogeneous; but, as will be seen later, heterogeneity of material,\r\nby determining unequal rates of erosion, stimulates the piratical\r\nproclivities of streams.\r\n\r\nAn actual case of piracy is shown on Plate XI. North and South Lakes\r\nformerly drained westward to the Schoharie Creek, the present head\r\nof which is in the extreme northwest corner of the map. The head of\r\nKaaterskill Creek, which had a much higher gradient, worked back\r\nand captured the head of the westward-flowing stream, diverting the\r\ndrainage from North and South Lakes to itself. Schoharie Creek was thus\r\nbeheaded.\r\n\r\nPlaatekill Creek, near the south limit of the map, appears to have\r\nbeheaded the creek flowing west and northwest, similarly diverting its\r\nhead waters. The Dells, Wis., quadrangle (U. S. Geol. Surv.) affords an\r\nillustration of domestic piracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RATE OF DEGRADATION.\r\n\r\nThe amount of mechanical sediment which the Mississippi River carries\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico is estimated to represent a rate of degradation\r\nfor the Mississippi basin of about one foot in 5000 years. But the\r\nmechanical sediment carried to the Gulf does not really represent the\r\ntotal degradation of the basin, for the water which sinks beneath the\r\nsurface is dissolving more or less rock substance, especially lime\r\ncarbonate. This material is carried to the sea in solution, and does\r\nnot appear in the sediment on which the above estimate is based. Taking\r\ninto account the matter dissolved by the water and carried to the sea\r\nin solution, the average rate of degradation for the Mississippi basin\r\nis estimated at one foot in 3000 to 4000 years.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that this rate is uniform, or even that\r\nerosion at any rate whatsoever is taking place in all parts of the\r\nbasin. Such is not the fact. On the whole the rate of erosion is\r\ndoubtless greatest toward the margins of the basins where the land\r\nis in its topographic youth or early maturity. It is notably less in\r\nthe middle courses of the valleys, and erosion is locally exceeded by\r\ndeposition along the lower courses of the Mississippi and some of its\r\nmain tributaries.\r\n\r\nThe average elevation of North America is not accurately known, but it\r\nis probably not far from 2000 feet. If the present rate of degradation,\r\nsay one foot in 3500 years, were to continue, it would take something\r\nlike 7,000,000 years to bring the continent to sea-level. But this rate\r\nof degradation could not continue to the end, for as the continent\r\nbecame lower streams would become sluggish and erosion less rapid.\r\nLong before the continent reached base-level the rate of degradation,\r\nso far as dependent on mechanical erosion, would become so slow that\r\nthe time necessary to bring the continent to sea-level would be almost\r\ninconceivably prolonged. Furthermore, it is quite possible that\r\nthe land is suffering, or is liable to suffer, uplift, relative or\r\nabsolute. If the rate of rise were equal to the rate of degradation the\r\naverage height of the continent would of course not be affected.\r\n\r\n  The amount of sediment carried by streams in suspension varies\r\n  notably according to the stage of the water. During a year when\r\n  the stream was under careful study the Mississippi at Carrollton\r\n  (Miss.) was found to carry ¹⁄₆₈₁ of its weight of sediment during\r\n  the high-water stage of June, and ¹⁄₆₃₈₃ during the low-water of\r\n  October, the average for the year being ¹⁄₁₈₀₈. The average of a\r\n  greater number of records gives about ¹⁄₁₅₀₀ as the average ratio\r\n  between the weight of the sediment and the weight of the water.\r\n  This corresponds to about ¹⁄₂₉₀₀ by volume, the average specific\r\n  gravity being about 1.9. The amount of material carried in the\r\n  upper part of the water was notably less than that carried at\r\n  greater depths, but that carried midway between top and bottom was\r\n  about the same as that carried at the bottom.[32]\r\n\r\n  The discharge of the Mississippi River is about 19,500,000,000,000\r\n  cubic feet of water per year, and the sediment it carries in\r\n  suspension is estimated to weigh about 812,500,000,000 pounds. This\r\n  is equivalent to about 6,714,694,400 cubic feet. It is estimated\r\n  that about 750,000,000 cubic feet of sediment is rolled along the\r\n  bottom, giving a total of 7,468,694,400 cubic feet as the aggregate\r\n  annual load carried to the Gulf by the river. This would be\r\n  adequate to cover an area one square mile in extent to the depth of\r\n  268 feet per year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n  PART OF THE CATSKILLS, NEW YORK.\r\n  U. S.

The average amount of mineral matter in solution in 48\r\n  European streams cited by Bischoff[40] is .2127 part in a thousand,\r\n  of which CaCO₃ is rather more than half. The average mineral matter\r\n  in solution in 36 rivers cited by Roth[41] (including some of those\r\n  tabulated by Bischoff) is .2033 part in a thousand, of which CaCO₃\r\n  is slightly less than one-half.\r\n\r\n  An average for American and European rivers, so far as determinable\r\n  from data at hand, is about .1888 part in a thousand in solution,\r\n  of which CaCO₃ is slightly less than one-half. These last figures\r\n  are probably not very far from an average for river water in\r\n  general.\r\n\r\n  The following table shows the total amount of solids carried in\r\n  solution by the rivers indicated:[42]\r\n\r\n  Rhine           5,816,805 tons per year.\r\n  Rhone           8,290,464   „   „   „\r\n  Danube         22,521,434   „   „   „\r\n  Thames            613,930   „   „   „\r\n  Nile           16,950,000   „   „   „\r\n  Croton             66,795   „   „   „\r\n  Hudson            438,000   „   „   „\r\n  Mississippi   112,832,171   „   „   „\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\nCertain considerations of human interest in connection with river\r\nerosion are worthy of note. When a drainage system has reached its\r\nmature stage its basin has the roughest topography which it will have\r\nat any time during that cycle of erosion. At that stage, therefore,\r\nroad construction is relatively difficult. If the relief be great,\r\nroads must follow the valleys, or the crests of the ridges between\r\nthem, if they would avoid heavy grades. In such regions roads are\r\nusually few and crooked.\r\n\r\nThe stage of development of valleys has an influence on the\r\nnavigability of their streams. Streams well advanced in life are much\r\nmore readily navigable than young ones, because their grades are lower\r\nand their volumes of water greater. Old streams, on the other hand, are\r\nsometimes depositing sand or silt along their lower courses to such an\r\nextent as to interfere with navigation.\r\n\r\nAt certain stages of their development the power of streams is more\r\neasily utilized than at others. Young streams, depending as they do for\r\ntheir supply on the rainfall of a limited area, are likely to be fitful\r\nin their flow, and therefore unreliable as a source of power. This is\r\nespecially true where the precipitation is unequally distributed, and\r\nwhere the slopes are steep and free from forests. Because of their\r\ngreat volume, old and large streams, though sluggish, have great power,\r\nbut it is less easily controlled. Where streams are large enough to be\r\nnavigable industrial considerations often prevent the utilization of\r\ntheir power, the streams being more serviceable as highways than as\r\nsources of power. Other things being equal, it follows that streams are\r\nmost available for water-power when they are large enough to have a\r\nmoderately steady flow, and not so large as to be beyond ready control,\r\nor to be valuable for purposes of navigation.\r\n\r\nStreams are subject to more disastrous floods in some stages of their\r\ndevelopment than in others. Floods resulting from heavy rains are\r\nlikely to be greatest where the slopes above the drainage lines are on\r\nthe whole greatest, for this is the condition under which the water is\r\nmost quickly gathered into the drainage channels. The most disastrous\r\nfloods, humanly speaking, are those which affect wide-bottomed valleys,\r\nwhere the flats are settled. In such cases a relatively slight rise\r\nmay flood very extensive areas. In such valleys the most disastrous\r\nfloods are generally in the spring, when the waters from the melting\r\nsnows of the preceding winter are being discharged.[43] Many other\r\nconsiderations enter into the problem of floods. The presence of\r\nforests and other forms of vegetation on the slopes retards the flow of\r\nwater into the valleys, and so tends to prevent floods, or at any rate\r\nto make them less severe. Porous soil and subsoil, or in their absence\r\nporous rock, absorb the rainfall, and prevent its prompt descent into\r\nthe valleys and so tends to prevent or diminish floods.\r\n\r\nThe acreage of arable land within a given area stands in some relation\r\nto its drainage development. At an early stage in its erosion history,\r\nbefore an upland has been dissected by valleys, nearly all of it may\r\nbe arable. Later, when drainage is at its maturity, and when hillsides\r\nand ridge slopes constitute a large part of the area, there is probably\r\nthe least acreage of arable land. This is especially true if the slopes\r\nare so steep as to allow the soil to be readily washed away. At a still\r\nlater stage, when the valley bottoms have become wide and the slopes\r\nof the ridges and hills so reduced as to be available, the area of\r\ncultivable land is again increased.\r\n\r\nMarshes, ponds, and lakes have some bearing on the resources and\r\nindustries of a region, and they stand in a more or less definite\r\nrelation to the stage of erosion in which a region finds itself. In its\r\nyouth ponds and lakes may occupy much of the surface; in its maturity\r\nthey will have been largely drained.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are sufficient to show that the topography of a\r\nregion, even in so far as shaped by erosion, touches human interests at\r\nmany points.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ANALYSIS OF EROSION.[44]\r\n\r\nErosion is the term applied to all the processes by which earthy matter\r\nor rock is loosened and removed from one place to another. It consists\r\nof three sub-processes, namely, _weathering_, _transportation_, and\r\n_corrasion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Weathering._\r\n\r\nThe term weathering is applied to nearly all those natural processes\r\nwhich tend to loosen or change the exposed surfaces of rock. The\r\nlettering of inscriptions on exposed marble becomes fainter and fainter\r\nas time goes by, and finally disappears, because the rock in which\r\nthe letters were cut has weathered away. Some of it has crumbled off\r\nas the result of the expansion and contraction induced by changes of\r\ntemperature, and some of it has been dissolved by the rain which has\r\nfallen upon it. In this case the weathering is effected partly by the\r\natmosphere and partly by water. These are the chief, but not the only\r\nagents concerned in the general processes of weathering. Those phases\r\nof weathering which are the result of the activities of the atmosphere,\r\nwhether physical or chemical, have been discussed in connection with\r\nthe atmosphere (pp. 42 and 54).\r\n\r\nThe rain which falls upon the surface of exposed rock, and that which\r\nsinks through the soil to the solid rock below, dissolves, even if\r\nslowly, some of the rock constituents. Each constituent of a rock\r\ncomposed of several minerals may be looked upon as a binding material\r\nfor the others. When one is dissolved the rock crumbles, much as mortar\r\ndoes when the lime which cements the sand is dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe solution of mineral matter by ground water, as well as the\r\nother chemical changes it effects, is greatly augmented by the\r\nimpurities, especially carbonic and other organic gases, dissolved by\r\nthe water from the atmosphere and the soil. The commonest chemical\r\nchanges effected by the joint action of water and air, oxidation\r\nand carbonation, have been referred to in Chapter II. Hydration is\r\nmore exclusively the work of water, and is one of the commonest\r\nprocesses of rock change, and often of rock disintegration. Numerous\r\nother less simple chemical changes resulting from the activities\r\nof ground water are constantly in progress, and in so far as they\r\nlead to the disintegration of rock are processes of weathering. Many\r\nchemical changes involve notable changes in volume of the mineral\r\nmatter concerned. Merrill has calculated that in the conversion of\r\nthe granitic rock of the vicinity of Washington, D. C., into soil,\r\nits volume has been increased 88 percent., largely as the result\r\nof hydration.[45] Even when the chemical changes do not themselves\r\ndirectly involve the disintegration of the rock, the accompanying\r\nincrease of volume is sometimes sufficient to cause its physical\r\ndisruption. This also may be regarded as a phase of weathering.\r\n\r\nThe weathering accomplished by water, or under its influence, proceeds\r\nat rates which vary with the composition of the rock, the amount and\r\ncomposition of the water, the temperature, and certain other factors\r\nless susceptible of brief statement. The weathering effected by ground\r\nwater has a wider range both in area and depth than that due to\r\nchanges of temperature, for while the latter is effective only where\r\ntemperature changes are considerable, and where coherent material lies\r\nat the surface (p. 45), the former is operative to all depths to which\r\nwater sinks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 94.—Talus accumulation at the base of a steep\r\n  bluff. Weber Canyon, Uinta Mountains, Utah. The talus has accumulated\r\n  since the last glaciation of the valley and is therefore of very\r\n  recent origin. (Church.)]\r\n\r\nThere are other processes of weathering not due directly either to\r\nthe atmosphere or to water. The roots of trees and smaller plants\r\nfrequently grow into cracks of rocks, and, increasing in size, act much\r\nlike freezing water (p. 45) in similar situations. This wedge-work of\r\nroots is a phase of weathering.\r\n\r\nFrom the faces of steep cliffs masses of rock frequently fall. However\r\ndislodged, their descent is effected by gravity. The quantities of\r\ndébris at the bases of many cliffs, forming slopes of _talus_ (Fig.\r\n94), testify to the importance of the action of gravity in getting\r\nmaterial from higher to lower levels. Another phase of gravity-work is\r\nshown in Fig. 95. Here, under the influence of gravity and expansion\r\nand contraction, due to freezing and thawing and wetting and drying,\r\nthe surface material is creeping down slope. In the process the rock\r\nis being broken. The process illustrated by the figure involves\r\nweathering as well as other factors.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are among the commoner processes of weathering, although\r\nthey do not exhaust the list. The more active and tangible processes\r\nby which surface rocks are broken up, such as wave wear, river wear\r\nand glacier wear, are processes of corrasion. The mechanical wear\r\neffected by wind-driven sand might be considered either as corrasion\r\nor as weathering. It is more likely to be regarded as corrasion if the\r\namount of wear is considerable enough to be obvious. Rock is sometimes\r\ndecomposed by the chemical action of hot vapors, gases, and waters\r\nrising to the surface from considerable depths. This is often seen in\r\nvolcanic regions. A conspicuous illustration is seen in the canyon of\r\nthe Yellowstone in the National Park. Decay of this sort is perhaps not\r\nproperly weathering, but is not always readily distinguished from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 95.—Shows the downward creep of soil and slaty\r\n  rock under the influence of gravity.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of weathering in the general processes of erosion is\r\nshown in many ways. In regions where the mantle rock is the product\r\nof the decay of the solid rock beneath, and such regions constitute a\r\nlarge portion of the earth’s surface, the soil and subsoil represent\r\nthe excess of weathering over transportation. Since most of the earth’s\r\nsurface is covered with soil to a greater or less depth, it is clear\r\nthat, on the whole, weathering keeps ahead of transportation. Again,\r\nit is clear that the loosening of rock by weathering greatly increases\r\nthe erosion which a given amount of moving water can accomplish.\r\nNot only this, but weathering plays a much more important rôle in\r\nthe development of valleys than is commonly realized. This is best\r\nillustrated by the valleys of young swift streams. The valley which\r\nis not at its top ten times as wide as its stream is rare. The stream\r\nwhich has such a canyon has been cutting chiefly at its bottom.\r\nIgnoring its lateral corrasion, which is slight, the valley which it\r\nwould cut would have a width equal to its own. This is illustrated by\r\nFig. 96. Weathering in its broadest sense is largely responsible for\r\nthe width of such a valley, in so far as it exceeds the width of the\r\nstream. The work of weathering, slope wash, etc., has been to get the\r\nmaterial which originally lay between _a_, _b_, and _c_ down to the\r\nstream. The stream has then carried it away. The above illustration\r\nwould not apply to old and sluggish streams, for they, by their\r\nmeandering, widen their valleys independently of weathering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 96.—Diagram of a valley the top of which is ten\r\n  times the width of the stream.]\r\n\r\nWeathering is a part of erosion, but only a part. In so far as it is\r\neffected by solution the process involves the transportation of that\r\nwhich is dissolved to some other point. Transportation is also involved\r\nto some extent in the other processes of weathering, but the central\r\nidea of the processes embraced under this term is the loosening and\r\ndisrupting of rock by which it is prepared for transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Transportation._\r\n\r\nThe second element of erosion is transportation. The transportation\r\nof mechanical sediment is to be distinguished from the transportation\r\nof materials in solution. In so far as mineral matter is dissolved\r\nit becomes, so far as flowage is concerned, a part of the stream. If\r\nthe quantity dissolved were large it might influence the mobility of\r\nthe water, but the amount is usually too slight to influence the flow\r\nsensibly.\r\n\r\nThe sediment transported by a stream is either rolled along its bottom\r\nor carried in suspension at some higher level. The coarser materials\r\n(gravel and sand) are carried chiefly in the former position, and the\r\nfiner (silt and mud) largely in the latter.\r\n\r\n=Transporting power and velocity.=—The transporting power of running\r\nwater depends on its velocity. The formula expressing the relations\r\nbetween them is as follows: Transporting power, _t_, varies as the\r\nsixth power of velocity, _v_, (_tαv⁶_); that is, doubling the velocity\r\nof the stream increases its transporting power 64-fold. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this means that if a stream of given velocity is just able\r\nto move a stone of a given size, a stream with double that velocity\r\nwill be just able to move a stone of the same shape 64 times as large\r\nas the first. This may be graphically illustrated as follows: Let a\r\ncurrent be supposed just able to move the cube _a_ (Fig. 97). If the\r\ncurrent be doubled, twice as much water will strike the same surface\r\nwith twice the force in the same time; that is, the force exerted on\r\nthe cube _a_ will be quadrupled. It will, therefore, be able not only\r\nto move the one cube, but it will be able to move three other cubes\r\n(_b_, _c_, and _d_) besides (Fig. 98). The same current against any\r\nother equal surface would also be able to move four small cubes, and\r\nthere are sixteen such surfaces on the face of the large cube (Fig.\r\n99). It follows that the dimension of the cube which the stream with\r\nthe doubled velocity can move is four times as great as that of the\r\ncube which the original current could move, and the cubical contents\r\nof such a cube is 64 times as great as that of the first (64 = 2⁶)\r\n(Fig. 99). Swift streams, therefore, have enormously greater power of\r\ntransportation than sluggish ones. It does not necessarily follow that\r\ntransportation keeps pace with transporting power; that depends on the\r\naccessibility of materials suitable for transportation. A stream of\r\ngreat transporting power, like the Niagara at its rapids, may carry\r\nlittle sediment, because there is little to be had.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of a stream depends chiefly on three elements—its\r\ngradient, its volume, and its load, (i.e., the sediment it is moving).\r\nThe higher the gradient the greater the volume, and the less the load\r\nthe greater the velocity. The relation between gradient and velocity\r\nis evident; that between volume and velocity is illustrated by every\r\nstream in time of flood, when its rate of flow is greatly increased.\r\nThe relation between velocity and load is less obvious, but none the\r\nless definite. Every particle of sediment carried by a stream makes\r\na draught on its energy, and energy expended in this way reduces the\r\nvelocity. The draught on a stream’s energy of a particle carried in\r\nsuspension is measured by its mass into the distance it would fall in a\r\nunit of time in still water. It follows that a large particle makes a\r\nstronger draught on a stream’s energy than the same amount of material\r\nin smaller pieces. It follows also that the comminution of sediment\r\nfacilitates transportation in much more than a simple ratio, for not\r\nonly can a given amount of energy carry more fine material than coarse,\r\nbut a larger proportion of a stream’s energy can be utilized in the\r\ntransportation of the fine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 97–99.—Diagrammatic representation of the effect\r\n  of increased velocity on transporting power.]\r\n\r\n=How sediment is carried.=—Coarse materials, such as gravel stones,\r\nare rolled along the bottoms of the swift streams which carry them.\r\nTheir movement is effected by the impact of water. The same is true to\r\na large extent of sand grains, especially if they be coarse. So far as\r\nconcerns the material rolled along the bottom it is to be noted that a\r\nstream’s transporting power is dependent on the velocity of the water\r\nat its bottom. This is much less than the surface, or even the average\r\nvelocity. The particles of fine sediments, such as silt and mud, are\r\nfrequently carried by streams quite above their bottoms, as shown by\r\nthe roiliness of many streams. A particle of mud is usually a small\r\nbit of mineral matter, the specific gravity of which is two or three\r\ntimes that of water. Why does it not sink through the water and come\r\nto rest at the bottom of the stream, or suffer transportation as the\r\ngravel does?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 100.—Diagram to illustrate the relative strength\r\n  of the two forces acting on a particle in suspension. The arrows\r\n  represent the relative strength of the two forces when the stream’s\r\n  velocity is 5 miles per hour. No account is taken in the diagram of\r\n  the viscosity of the water, or of the acceleration of velocity of\r\n  fall.]\r\n\r\nA particle of sediment in running water is obviously subject to two\r\nforces, that of the current which tends to move it nearly horizontally\r\ndown-stream, and that of gravity which tends to carry it to the\r\nbed of the stream. In Fig. 100, the arrows _ab_ and _ac_ represent\r\nrespectively the relative force of gravity and a current of 5 miles\r\nper hour. As a result of these two forces the particle would tend to\r\ndescend in the general direction of _ad_, a line which represents\r\nthe resultant of these forces, though not the exact path which a\r\nparticle acted on by them would take in water. If a river were the\r\nsimple straightforward current which it is popularly thought to be,\r\na particle in suspension would reach its bottom in the time it would\r\ntake to sink through an equal depth of still water, for the descent\r\nwould be none the less certain and none the less prompt because of the\r\nforward movement of the water. The current would simply be a factor in\r\ndetermining the position of the particle when it reached the bottom,\r\nnot the time of reaching it. Very fine particles, like those of clay,\r\nthough having the same specific gravity as grains of sand, would sink\r\nless readily than coarser ones, because they expose larger surfaces,\r\nrelative to their mass, to the water through which they sink. But even\r\nsuch particles, unless of extraordinary fineness, would presently reach\r\nthe bottom if acted on only by a horizontal current and gravity. Since\r\neven sediment which is not of exceeding fineness is kept in suspension\r\nit is clear that some other factor is involved. This is found, in part\r\nat least, in the subordinate upward currents in a stream.\r\n\r\nWhere a bowlder occurs in the bed of a stream (Fig. 101) the water\r\nwhich strikes it is in part forced up over it. If there be many\r\nbowlders the process is frequently repeated, and the number of upward\r\ncurrents is great. Any roughness will serve the same purpose, and\r\nevery stream’s bed is rough to a greater or less extent. Where there\r\nare roughnesses at the sides of a channel, currents are started which\r\nflow from them toward the center. The varying velocities of the\r\ndifferent parts of a stream serve a similar purpose. The curves in a\r\nriver tend to give the water a rotatory movement. A river is therefore\r\nto be looked upon not as a single straightforward current, but as a\r\nmultitude of currents, some rising from the bottom toward the top, some\r\ndescending from top to bottom, some diverging from the center toward\r\nthe sides, and some converging from the sides toward the center. The\r\nexistence of these subordinate currents is often evident from the\r\nboiling and eddying readily seen in many streams. It is, of course,\r\ntrue that the sum of the upward currents is always less than the sum of\r\nthe downward, so that the aggregate motion of the water is down slope;\r\nbut it is also true that minor upward currents are common. Sediment\r\nin suspension is held up chiefly by such currents, which, locally\r\nand temporarily, overcome the effect of gravity. The particles in\r\nsuspension are constantly tending to fall, and frequently falling; but\r\nbefore they reach the bottom many of them are seized and carried upward\r\nby the subordinate currents, only to sink and be carried up again. Even\r\nif they reach the bottom, as they frequently do, they may be picked\r\nup again. It is probable that every particle of sediment of such size\r\nthat it would sink readily in still water is dropped and picked up many\r\ntimes in the course of any long river journey, and its periods of rest\r\noften exceed its periods of movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 101.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of\r\n  bowlders, _a_ and _b_, in a stream’s bed on the currents of water\r\n  impinging against them.]\r\n\r\nIndependently of the subordinate currents, the different velocities of\r\nthe different parts of a stream tend to keep materials in suspension\r\nby exerting different pressures on the different sides of suspended\r\nparticles.[46]\r\n\r\nRiver ice sometimes facilitates the transportation of débris which the\r\nwater alone could not carry. The ice freezes to bowlders in the banks\r\nof the streams, to those which are partially submerged, and sometimes\r\nto those altogether submerged beneath slight depths of water. When the\r\nice breaks up in the spring such bowlders, buoyed up by the ice, may be\r\nfloated far down the stream. The influence of ice in this connection\r\nis most considerable in high latitudes, but it is of consequence as\r\nfar south as Virginia, where the river deposits sometimes contain\r\nbowlders which the unaided streams could not have carried. _Ground ice_\r\nsometimes forms about bowlders in the bottoms of streams, especially\r\nin the quiet pools of turbulent rivers, and floats them to the surface\r\nbefore the surface itself is frozen.[47] In the floods of spring rivers\r\noften spread their ice widely over their flood-plains. It is sometimes\r\nmassed in constricted portions of valleys so as to form great dams, the\r\nbreaking of which is attended with great destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Corrasion._\r\n\r\n=Abrasion.=—The wear effected by running water is _corrasion_. So\r\nlong as the materials to be carried away are incoherent it is easy\r\nto see how running water picks them up and carries them forward. The\r\nwater which gathers in the depressions on the slope of a cultivated\r\nfield gathers earthy matter from the surface over which it passes,\r\neven before it is concentrated into rills, and the rills continue the\r\nprocess. Thus the loose materials of the surface are gathered at the\r\nvery sources of the streams, and the amount of sediment in the water\r\nafter a heavy shower, even at the head of the stream, may be great.\r\nThe run-off from the slopes of any valley in any part of its course\r\nlikewise brings sediment to the stream, which gathers more from its bed\r\nwhereever it flows with sufficient velocity over incoherent material.\r\nStreams also undercut their banks, and receive new load from the fall\r\nof the overhanging material.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger part of the sediment acquired by a normal stream is\r\nmade up of material loosened in advance by the processes of weathering.\r\nThe stream, or the waters which get together to make the stream,\r\nfind them ready-made; but rivers frequently wear rock which is not\r\nweathered, for the principal valleys of the earth’s surface are cut in\r\nsolid rock, and many of them in rock of exceeding hardness. How does\r\nthe stream wear the solid rock?\r\n\r\nWhen a stream flows over a rock bed, the wear which it accomplishes\r\ndepends chiefly on the character of the rock, the velocity of the\r\nstream, and the load it carries. If the rock be stratified and in thin\r\nlayers, and if these thin layers be broken by numerous joints at high\r\nangles to the stratification planes, the impact of the water of a clear\r\nstream of even moderate strength may be effective in dislodging bits of\r\nthe rock. This condition of things is often seen where streams run on\r\nbeds of shale or slate. If the rock be hard and without bedding-planes\r\nand joints, or if its layers be thick and its joints few, clear water\r\nwill be much less effective. If the surface of the rock be rough, the\r\nmechanical action of a swift stream of clear water might still produce\r\nsome effect on it; but if massive hard rock presents a smooth surface\r\nto a clear stream, the mechanical effect of even a swift current is\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nThis general principle is illustrated by the Niagara River. Just above\r\nthe falls the current is swift. When the river is essentially free from\r\nsediment, the surface of the limestone near the bank beneath it is\r\nsometimes distinctly green from the presence of the one-celled plants\r\n(fresh-water algæ) which grow upon it. The whole force of the mighty\r\ntorrent is not able to sweep them from their moorings. Were the stream\r\nsupplied with a tithe of the sand which it is capable of carrying, it\r\nwould not take many hours, and perhaps not many minutes, to remove the\r\nlast trace of vegetation. This illustration furnishes a clue to the\r\nmethod by which the erosion of solid rock in a stream’s bed is effected.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the ingathering waters which make a stream often\r\nhave abundant sediment before they reach well-defined stream channels,\r\nand that the streams continue to gather sediment whereever their beds\r\nare composed of material which is readily detached. The sediments which\r\nthe stream carries are the tools with which it works. Without them\r\nit is relatively impotent, so far as the abrasion of solid rock is\r\nconcerned; with them, it may wear any rock over which it passes (Fig.\r\n102).\r\n\r\nWe have next to inquire the methods by which running water uses its\r\ntools in the excavation of valleys. When gravel is rolled along in\r\nthe channel of a stream there is friction between it and the bed over\r\nwhich it moves. If the pebbles be as hard as the bed over which they\r\nare rolled their movement must result in its wear, and even if they be\r\nsofter more or less wear takes place. As the moving stones wear the\r\nrock of the stream’s bed they are themselves worn by impact with it and\r\nwith one another. In all cases the softer material suffers the more\r\nrapid wear. The first effect of wear on materials in transportation is\r\nthe reduction of their rugosities of surface. The projecting points\r\nand sharp angles are worn off, and the stones are reduced to rounded\r\n_water-worn_ forms. The particles broken off make grains of sand, or,\r\nif very fine, particles of silt or mud. Even after a stone has been\r\nrounded it is subject to further wear and reduction, and in the course\r\nof time may be literally worn out.\r\n\r\nThe sediment carried in suspension, as well as that rolled along\r\nthe bottom, may wear the rock bed of a stream. When a grain of sand\r\nin suspension escapes from an upward moving current it may not sink\r\nquietly. If it be caught by a downward current it may be made to strike\r\na blow on the bed of the stream, and the effect of the blow is to wear\r\nthe surface which receives it. The larger the grain and the stronger\r\nthe current the greater the wear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 102.—Some of the tools with which a stream works.\r\n  The cobbles and bowlders have been shifted by the stream in its flow.\r\n  Other stones and bowlders now in transit cause the ripples in the\r\n  stream. The Chelan River, Wash., just above its junction with the\r\n  Columbia. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless repetition of the blows struck by the material in\r\nsuspension, or rolled on its bottom, hour after hour, day after day,\r\nand year after year, will accomplish sensible results. In the long\r\ncourse of the ages this process has excavated deep valleys. Concomitant\r\nprocesses are largely concerned in making valleys wide, but the depth\r\nof valleys cut in solid rock is chiefly the result of the impact and\r\nfriction of the sediment in transportation.\r\n\r\nThe wear effected in this way is not proportional to the number of\r\nblows struck. Since every pebble and every grain of sand carried\r\ndiminishes the velocity of a stream, and since with diminished velocity\r\nthe force of the blows struck is diminished, it follows that the blows\r\nmay become so weak, as the result of their multiplication, as to be\r\nineffective. The larger the load, therefore, which the stream carries,\r\nthe more the tools with which it has to work, but the less effectively\r\ncan it use them; and the load may be so far increased as to destroy its\r\ncorrasive power altogether. On the other hand, the smaller the load\r\nof the stream the greater its velocity and the more effectively will\r\nits tools be used; but their number may be so far reduced that their\r\naggregate effect is slight. To accomplish the greatest results on a bed\r\nof solid rock a stream must have tools to work with, but must not be so\r\nheavily burdened as to interfere with its effective use of them.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause of their unequal velocities swift and slow streams\r\ncorrade their valleys differently. The erosion of a swift stream is\r\nchiefly at the bottom of its channel. The sluggish stream lowers\r\nits channel less rapidly, while lateral erosion is relatively more\r\nimportant. The result is that slow streams increase the width of their\r\nvalleys more than the depth, while swift streams increase the depth\r\nmore than the width. It follows that slow streams develop flats, while\r\nswift ones do not. Not only is a slow stream more likely to have a\r\nflat, and therefore a better chance to meander, but it is more likely\r\nto take advantage of opportunities in this line, for a slow stream gets\r\nout of the way for such obstacles as it may encounter, while a swift\r\nstream is much more likely to get obstacles out of its way.\r\n\r\nSpecial phases of corrasion are introduced where waterfalls and other\r\npeculiarities dependent on inequalities of rock resistance occur.\r\n\r\n=Solution.=—In most cases the solution effected by a stream is\r\nmuch less important than its mechanical work. Only when conditions\r\nare unfavorable to the latter, is solution the chief factor in the\r\nexcavation of a valley. This may be the case where a stream’s bed is\r\nover soluble rock, such as limestone, and where the stream is clear,\r\nor its gradient so low that its current is sluggish. The solvent power\r\nof water is not influenced by the presence of sediment, though the\r\npresence of sediment offers the water a greater surface on which to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE RATE OF EROSION.\r\n\r\nIn considering the rate of erosion, both the work of the stream in\r\nits valley and that of the general run-off are to be considered. The\r\nconditions which favor the most rapid erosion in a stream’s channel are\r\nnot necessarily those which determine most rapid degradation in the\r\nbasin outside of the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Influence of Declivity._\r\n\r\nIn general the greater the declivity the more rapid the rate of\r\nerosion, whether in the stream’s channel or on the slopes above it. The\r\ntruth of this conclusion is illustrated by the great erosive power of\r\nswift streams as compared with slow ones.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that high declivity favors each element\r\nof erosion. The effect of declivity on weathering is far from simple.\r\nFor example, great declivity, by allowing more of the rainfall to flow\r\noff over the surface, and by causing it to flow off more promptly,\r\nrestricts the work of solution, and therefore of decomposition, both\r\nat the surface and beneath it. High declivity is also unfavorable to\r\nthe growth of vegetation, and so to the wedge-work of roots. On the\r\nother hand, a given amount of wedge-work of roots and ice is more\r\neffective where the slope is steep than where it is gentle, for such\r\nmaterials as are loosened descend the slopes more readily. The prompt\r\nremoval of weathered materials, by exposing fresh surfaces of rock,\r\naccelerates weathering. The total amount of weathering may therefore\r\nnot be diminished by the increase of slope, even though certain of its\r\nprocesses are hindered.\r\n\r\nThe effect of high declivity on transportation, the second element of\r\nerosion, is too patent to need explanation.\r\n\r\nCorrasion likewise is favored by high declivity, for the abrasive power\r\nof a stream increases as the square of its velocity. With corrasive\r\npower increased, corrasion will also be increased if the water has\r\ntools to work with. Since high declivity greatly increases both the\r\ntransporting and the corrasive power of running water, and favors\r\ncertain elements of weathering, it is clear that the aggregate effect\r\nof high declivity is to favor erosion, whether in the channel of the\r\nstream or on the general surface of its drainage basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Influence of Rock._\r\n\r\nThe physical constitution, the chemical composition, and the\r\nstratigraphy of a rock formation, influence the rate at which it may\r\nbe broken up and carried away. Clastic or fragmental rocks are usually\r\nstratified and made up of cemented pebbles (conglomerate), sand grains\r\n(sandstone), or particles of mud (shale). Igneous rocks, such as\r\ngranite, are massive instead of stratified, and are usually made up of\r\ngreat numbers of interlocking crystals which bind one another together.\r\nSome crystalline rocks, such as schists, though not stratified, possess\r\ncleavage, which has much the effect of stratification, so far as\r\nerosion is concerned. All rocks are affected by systems of more or less\r\nnearly vertical cracks called _joints_. All these structures have their\r\ninfluence upon the rate of degradation.\r\n\r\n=Physical constitution.=—Clastic rocks may be firmly cemented, or their\r\nconstituents may be loosely bound together. The less the coherence the\r\nmore ready the disintegration, and the finer the particles the more\r\neasily are they carried away. When the particles in transportation\r\nare angular they effect more wear on the bed over which they move,\r\nand on one another, than when they are round. The difference is great\r\nwhere the particles are large, and little where they are very small.\r\nIf the materials carried be harder than the bed over which they pass,\r\ncorrasion of the latter is favored.\r\n\r\n=Chemical composition.=—Something also depends on the chemical\r\ncomposition of the rock, since this affects its solubility, and\r\ntherefore its rate of decomposition. The more soluble the rock the\r\nlarger the proportion of it which will be taken away in solution; but\r\nit does not follow that the most soluble rock will be most rapidly\r\neroded, since the rate of erosion depends on abrasion as well as\r\nsolution, and a rock which is readily soluble, as rocks go, may be less\r\neasily abraded than a rock which is made of discrete and insoluble\r\nparticles bound together by a soluble cement. In such rocks, for\r\nexample a sandstone in which the grains are cemented together by\r\nlime carbonate, the solution of the cement sets free a considerable\r\nquantity of sand, so that a small amount of solution prepares a large\r\namount of sediment for removal. A stream might cut its valley much\r\nmore rapidly in such a sandstone than in a compact limestone, though\r\nthe latter is, as a whole, the more soluble. The constituent minerals\r\nof crystalline rocks resist solution and decay unequally, and when any\r\none is dissolved or decomposed the rock crumbles and the less soluble\r\nconstituents are ready for removal by mechanical means. So long as the\r\nmaterial loosened by disintegration is removed, chemical heterogeneity\r\nfavors erosion; but if the loosened débris is not removed erosion is\r\nnot favored by chemical heterogeneity. In such a case erosion would be\r\nmost rapid where the rock was most soluble.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The structure of the rock has much to do with the rate of\r\nits erosion. Other things being equal, stratified rock is more readily\r\neroded than massive rock, since stratification-planes are planes of\r\ncleavage, and therefore of weakness. Taking advantage of these planes\r\nthe water has less breaking to perform to reduce the material to a\r\ntransportable condition. For the same reason a thin-bedded formation is\r\nmore easily eroded than a thick-bedded one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 103 and 104.—Diagrams to illustrate the fact\r\n  that a stream crosses many more cleavage-planes when the beds of rock\r\n  are inclined than when they are horizontal.]\r\n\r\nThe beds of stratified rock may be horizontal, vertical, or inclined,\r\nand inclined strata may stand at any angle between horizontality and\r\nverticality. In indurated formations the rate of erosion is influenced\r\nboth by the position of the strata and by the relation of the direction\r\nof the flowing water to their dip and strike. On the whole the strata\r\nwhich are horizontal, or but slightly inclined, are probably less\r\nfavorable for rapid erosion than those which are vertical or inclined\r\nat considerable angles. This is at least true where the layers are of\r\nuniform hardness and the joints infrequent.\r\n\r\nHorizontal strata expose fewer cleavage planes to the water flowing\r\nover them than strata in any other position. In Fig. 103 the stream\r\nwhich has the profile ad crosses bedding-planes at _b_ and _c_. In\r\nFig. 104, where the beds dip up-stream, many more division-planes\r\nare crossed in the same distance. Since bedding-planes are planes of\r\nweakness, it follows that horizontal and nearly horizontal strata are\r\nnot, under ordinary conditions of erosion, in a position favorable for\r\nmost rapid wear. When strata are horizontal, it makes no difference\r\nwhich way the stream runs, for the current sustains the same relation\r\nto the cleavage-planes whatever its course.\r\n\r\nIn the case of incoherent material the position of the beds, or even\r\ntheir existence, has little influence on the rate of erosion. Such\r\nformations are weak in all directions, not simply along bedding-planes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 105.—Diagram to illustrate the various relations\r\n  a stream may sustain to the outcrop of vertical layers of rock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 106.—Diagram to illustrate the various relations\r\n  a stream may sustain to the outcrops of inclined layers of rock.]\r\n\r\nWhen the strata are vertical, three distinct cases may arise (Fig.\r\n105). The stream may flow (1) with the strike (_aa_); (2) at right\r\nangles to the strike (_bb_); or (3) oblique to it (_cc_) at any angle\r\nwhatsoever. It is perhaps not possible to say which of these positions\r\nis most favorable for erosion, for the character of the rock, the\r\nthickness of its layers, its ability to stand with steep slopes, and\r\nthe strength of the currents concerned, would influence the result. A\r\nstream which flows at right angles to the strike (_bb_, Fig. 105) would\r\ncross more cleavage-planes in a given distance than a stream flowing in\r\nany other direction, and would strike the outcropping edges of layers\r\nat the angle of greatest advantage. A stream flowing along the strike\r\n(_aa_), on the other hand, has better opportunity to sink its channel\r\non cleavage-planes, and the current oblique to the strike (_cc_), has\r\nsome of the advantages of each of the others.\r\n\r\nWhen the strata are inclined five cases may arise. (1) The stream\r\nmay be parallel to the strike (_aa_, Fig. 106), when it makes no\r\ndifference which way the current flows; it may be at right angles to\r\nthe strike (_bb′_), and (2) flowing with the dip (toward _b′_), or\r\n(3) against it (toward _b_); it may be oblique to the strike, and\r\nflowing (4) in the general direction of dip (toward _c′_); or (5) in\r\nthe opposite direction (toward _c_). As before, the stream flowing at\r\nright angles to the strike would cross the largest number of layers\r\nin a given distance, and so have an opportunity to take advantage of\r\nmore cleavage-planes than a stream in any other position. But in the\r\ncase of inclined strata a new element enters into the problem. When the\r\nstream flows parallel to the strike, the valley which is in process of\r\ndeepening is not sunk vertically, but is shifted more or less in the\r\ndirection of the dip (Fig. 107). This is called _monoclinal shifting_.\r\nThe result is that there is a constant tendency to undermine (sap) the\r\nvalley bluff on the down-dip side, and this process of sapping will,\r\naccording to its rate, accelerate the growth of the valley, especially\r\nin width. Monoclinal shifting is favored by the presence of a hard\r\nlayer (_H_), as shown in Fig. 107, if this stratum is the bed of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.—Diagram to illustrate monoclinal shifting. The\r\n  valley _abc_, as seen in cross-section, becomes _deb_, as the stream\r\n  lowers its channel.]\r\n\r\nIn the second and third cases mentioned above, the only difference is\r\nin the angle at which the current strikes the outcropping edges of\r\nlayers and laminæ. The mechanical advantage is with the stream which\r\nflows with the dip. In the fourth and fifth cases something will\r\ndepend on the angle which the stream’s course makes with the strike.\r\nIn all these cases, as in those where the strata are vertical, much\r\nwill depend on the thickness and resistance of the layers and on the\r\nstrength of the currents concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The Influence of Climate._\r\n\r\nClimate has both a direct and an indirect effect on erosion. Its\r\ndirect influence is through precipitation, evaporation, changes of\r\ntemperature, and wind; its indirect, through vegetation. Like declivity\r\nand rock structure, climate does not affect all elements of erosion\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nThe chief elements of climate are temperature, moisture, and\r\natmospheric movements; the principal factors which influence it are\r\nlatitude, altitude, distance from the sea, direction of prevailing\r\nwinds, and topographic relations.\r\n\r\nThe effects of variations in temperature on rock weathering have\r\nalready been discussed (p. 43). They are chiefly mechanical, and are\r\nseen at their best where the daily range is great.\r\n\r\nHigh temperature favors chemical action, and the weathering of rock\r\nby decomposition is at its best in the presence of abundant moisture\r\nin regions where the temperature is uniformly high. Furthermore, a\r\nwarm moist climate favors the growth of vegetation, the decay of which\r\nsupplies the water with organic acids which greatly increase its\r\nsolvent power. The climatic conditions favoring mechanical weathering\r\nare therefore different from those favoring chemical weathering. High\r\ntemperature and abundant moisture and vegetation are found in many\r\ntropical regions, and here the rock is often decomposed to greater\r\ndepths, on the whole, than in high latitudes. How far this is the\r\nresult of rapid weathering, and how far of slow removal, due in part\r\nto the protective influence of the plants, cannot be affirmed. If the\r\nweathered material is not removed, it will presently become a mantle\r\nthick enough to retard the processes which brought it into existence.\r\n\r\nSo long as the water of the surface and that in the soil remains\r\nunfrozen, temperature affects neither corrasion nor transportation.\r\nBut in middle and high latitudes the surface is frozen for some part\r\nof each year. During this time corrasion is at a minimum, for although\r\nthe streams continue to flow there is relatively little water running\r\nover the surface outside the drainage channels, and that little is\r\nrelatively ineffective. Under some conditions, therefore, temperature\r\naffects both corrasion and transportation.\r\n\r\nThe humidity of the atmosphere has an influence even more important\r\nthan that of temperature on the rate of erosion, and its influence\r\nis exerted on each of the elements of that complex process. A moist\r\natmosphere favors oxidation, carbonation, hydration, and the growth of\r\nvegetation, all of which promote certain phases of rock weathering.\r\nOn the other hand, humidity tends to prevent sudden and considerable\r\nvariations in temperature, thus checking the weathering effected\r\nby this means. Precipitation, the most important single factor in\r\ndetermining the rate of erosion, is dependent on atmospheric humidity.\r\nIts amount, its kind (rain or snow), and its distribution in time, are\r\nthe elements which determine its effectiveness in any given place.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal the greater the amount of precipitation\r\nthe more rapid the corrasion and transportation. Much, however,\r\ndepends on its distribution in time. A given amount of rainfall may\r\nbe distributed equally through the year, or it may fall during a\r\nwet season only. The maximum inequality of distribution would occur\r\nif all the rainfall of a given period were concentrated in a single\r\nshower. With such concentration the volume of water flowing off over\r\nthe surface immediately after the down-pour would be greater than\r\nunder any other conditions of precipitation, and since velocity is\r\nincreased with volume, and erosive power with velocity, it follows\r\nthat the erosive power of a given amount of water would be greater\r\nunder these circumstances than under any other. Furthermore, a larger\r\nproportion of the precipitation would run off over the surface under\r\nthese circumstances than under any other, for less of it would sink\r\nbeneath the surface and less would be evaporated. If erosive power\r\nand rate of erosion were equal terms, this would therefore be the\r\ncondition for greatest erosion; but erosive power and rate of erosion\r\ndo not always correspond. If the water falling in this way could\r\nget hold of all the material it could carry, extreme concentration\r\nof precipitation would be the condition favorable for most rapid\r\nerosion. But if the amount of available material for transportation\r\nis slight, a large part of the force of the water could not be\r\nutilized in erosion. It follows that if there were a large amount of\r\ndisintegrated material on the surface, erosion would be greater the\r\ngreater the concentration of precipitation. If, on the other hand,\r\nthere were but little disintegrated material on the surface, frequent\r\nshowers, with intervening periods when conditions were favorable for\r\nweathering, that is, for preparing material for transportation, might\r\nbe more favorable for rapid erosion. While the total energy of running\r\nwater available for erosion under these conditions would be less than\r\nbefore, there might in the long run be more material for transport;\r\nfor weathering in the presence of moisture, and all that goes with\r\nit, might be more effective in preparing material for transportation,\r\nthan weathering during the long periods of drought which would occur\r\nif the precipitation were concentrated to its maximum. Temperature\r\nfavoring, the uniform distribution of moisture through the year would\r\nallow the growth of vegetation, which, although favoring some processes\r\nof weathering, retards erosion in general. While therefore it is not\r\npossible to say what distribution of rainfall favors most rapid erosion\r\nwithout knowing the nature of the surface on which it is to fall,\r\nenough has been said to show that the problem is by no means a simple\r\none. Some of the most striking phases of topography developed by\r\nerosion, such as those of the Bad Lands (Figs. 75 to 78, and 108), are\r\ndeveloped where the rainfall is unequally distributed in time, and too\r\nslight or too infrequent to support abundant vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 108.—Bad-land topography developed under\r\n  conditions of aridity and unequal distribution of rainfall. Slope of\r\n  Pinal Mountains, Ariz. (Ransome, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nDuring its fall, and immediately after, rain is more effective than\r\nan equal amount of snow; but the snow may be accumulated through\r\na considerable period of the year, and then melted rapidly, when\r\nit has an effect comparable to that which would be produced by the\r\nconcentration of the rainfall into a limited period of the year. If\r\nthe ground beneath be frozen when the snow melts (and this is often\r\nthe case) the erosion accomplished by the resulting water will be\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nExcept in dry regions, where wind-work sometimes exceeds water-work,\r\nthe movements of the atmosphere are of less importance directly\r\nthan precipitation in determining the rate of erosion. But even in\r\nregions which are not arid the winds have much to do with the rate of\r\nevaporation and the distribution of rainfall, so that their indirect\r\neffect is great. Even their direct effects in moist climates are not to\r\nbe lost sight of, for even here the surface is sometimes dry enough to\r\nyield dust and sand, and the uprooting of trees so disturbs the surface\r\nas to make earthy débris more accessible to wind and water. Where trees\r\ngain precarious footholds on steep slopes, as they often do, they are\r\nlikely to be overturned as soon as they are large enough to offer\r\nconsiderable resistance to the wind, and in the overturning, large\r\nquantities of rock are sometimes loosened and carried down the slope\r\nby gravity. This phase of destructive work is seen at its best on the\r\nwalls of gorges, where trees often flourish until their tops project\r\nabove the rim of the valley.\r\n\r\nThrough vegetation, climate influences erosion in ways which are\r\neasily defined qualitatively, but not quantitatively. Both by its\r\ngrowth (wedge-work of roots) and by its decay (supplying CO₂, etc.,\r\nto descending waters) it favors certain phases of weathering; but, on\r\nthe other hand, it retards corrasion and transportation both by wind\r\nand water. This is well shown along the banks of streams and on the\r\nfaces of cliffs, in clay, sand, etc. Its aggregate effect is probably\r\nunfavorable to erosion by mechanical means, and favorable to that by\r\nchemical processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 109.—Characteristic cliffs of high arid regions.\r\n  Right wall of Snake River canyon, nearly opposite the mouth of Salmon\r\n  River, Id. Two spring-formed coves, with “Castle Rock” between.\r\n  (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nErosion in high arid regions differs from that in regions of abundant\r\nrainfall in several ways. It is obvious that the valleys will develop\r\nmore slowly in the former, that they will remain young longer, that the\r\nperiod necessary for the dissection of the surface is greater, that\r\nthe watercourses will be less numerous, and that fewer of them will\r\nhave permanent streams. There are certain other differences which are\r\nless obvious. If the arid region be high and composed of heterogeneous\r\nstrata, the topography which erosion develops is more angular (Fig.\r\n83) than that of the humid region. This is because there is less\r\nrock decay, and less vegetation to hold the products of decay. The\r\nmore resistant beds of rock therefore come into greater prominence,\r\nespecially on slopes, where they develop cliffs (Figs. 109 and 110).\r\nThese general principles find abundant illustration in the plateaus of\r\nthe western part of the United States,[48] where the cliffs are by no\r\nmeans confined to the immediate valleys of the streams (Fig. 1, Pl.\r\nXII).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 110.—A Butte. A characteristic feature of the\r\n  arid plateau region of the West. (Dutton, Mono. II, U. S. Geol.\r\n  Surv.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EFFECTS OF UNEQUAL HARDNESS.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages incidental reference has been made to the\r\nresults of inequalities of rock resistance. This topic will now be\r\nconsidered more fully.\r\n\r\n=Rapids and falls.=—Returning for a moment to the hypothetical island\r\nwith which our study of erosion began, let a horizontal layer of hard\r\nrock be assumed to run through it (H, Fig. 111). As the rain falls\r\non the land and runs off over it, wear will be less rapid where the\r\nhard layer comes to the surface than at the higher or lower levels. As\r\na result, the slope will become steeper at and below the outcrop of\r\nthe hard layer, and less steep immediately above it, as shown by _ab_\r\nin Fig. 111. Under these conditions the water passing over the hard\r\nledge constitutes _rapids_. The increased erosion which accompanies\r\nthe increased velocity makes the rapids more rapid. The process may\r\ncontinue until the water _falls_, rather than _flows_ over the hard\r\nlayer (_cd_, Fig. 111). With continued rainfall the edges of the hard\r\nlayer, together with the slopes above and below, would continue to\r\nrecede toward the center of the island. Under conditions of absolute\r\nhomogeneity of material, save for the hard layer specified, no valley\r\nwould be developed, and therefore no stream.\r\n\r\nIf the surface was so changed as to allow of the development of a\r\nvalley (p. 63) the same principles would be applicable. As an active\r\nstream passes from a hard layer to one less resistant, the greater\r\nwear on the latter gives origin to rapids. At first the rapids would\r\nbe slight (_a_, Fig. 112), but would become more considerable (_b_) as\r\ntime and erosion go on. When the bed of the rapids becomes sufficiently\r\nsteep, the rapids become _falls_[49] (_cd_). When the water falls\r\nrather than flows over the rock surface below the hard layer, erosion\r\nassumes a new phase. The hard layer is then undermined, and the\r\nundermining causes the falls to recede. This phase of erosion is\r\nsometimes called _sapping_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 111.—Diagram representing a horizontal layer of\r\n  hard rock in an island, and its effects on erosion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 112.—Diagram illustrating the development of a\r\n  fall where the hard layer dips gently up-stream.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 113.—Diagram illustrating the conditions which\r\n  exist at Niagara Falls. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\nIf the hard layer which occasions a fall dips up-stream (Fig. 112), its\r\noutcrop in the stream’s bed becomes lower as the fall recedes (_e_).\r\nWhen it has become so low that the water passing over it no longer\r\nreacts effectively against the less resistant material beneath (_f_),\r\nsapping ceases, and the point of greatest erosion may be shifted from\r\nthe soft material beneath the fall to the hard layer itself. The actual\r\nrate of erosion at this point may be no greater than before, though\r\nthe relative rate is. Under these circumstances the vertical edge of\r\nthe hard layer will presently be converted into an incline (_f_), and\r\nas this takes place the fall becomes rapids. The conversion of the\r\nfalls into the rapids begins about the time the lower edge of the hard\r\nstratum in the channel reaches grade. By continuation of the process\r\nwhich transformed the falls into rapids, the rapids become less rapid,\r\nand when the upper edge of the hard layer has been brought to grade,\r\nthe rapids disappear (_h_, Fig. 112). The history of rapids which\r\nsucceed falls is the reverse of that which preceded. The later rapids\r\nare steepest at the beginning of their history, the earlier at their\r\nend. Stated in other terms, rapids are steepest when nearest falls\r\nin time. Slight differences in hardness in successive layers often\r\noccasion successive falls or rapids (Fig. 114).\r\n\r\nIf the hard layer which occasions the falls be horizontal, instead of\r\ndipping up-stream, the general result would be the same; but, other\r\nthings being equal, the duration of the falls developed under these\r\nconditions would be greater, since they must recede farther before\r\nbecoming rapids.\r\n\r\nIf the layers of unequal hardness in a stream’s bed be vertical and the\r\ncourse of the stream at right angles to the strike, rapids, and perhaps\r\nfalls, will develop (Fig. 115). The chances for falls are greater,\r\nthe greater the difference in hardness. Falls developed under these\r\nconditions, as well as the rapids preceding and following, would remain\r\nconstant in position until the resistant layer was brought to grade,\r\nbut they would ultimately disappear as in the preceding cases. Falls\r\nare not likely to develop where the strata of the stream’s bed dip\r\ndown-stream, though they may develop even under these conditions if the\r\ngradient of the stream is greater than the dip of the strata (Fig. 116).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 114.—Falls in Utica shale, Canajoharie, N. Y.\r\n  (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe inequality of resistance in the rock which occasions a fall may\r\nbe original or secondary. In the case of Niagara Falls[50] (Fig.\r\n113) relatively resistant limestone overlies relatively weak shale.\r\nAt the Falls of St. Anthony (Minneapolis) limestone overlies friable\r\nsandstone. The falls of the Yellowstone and the Shoshone Falls of\r\nthe Snake River (Idaho), are in igneous rock. In the former case the\r\nunequal resistance is occasioned by unequal decay of the rock, due\r\nperhaps to the rise of hot vapors which have decomposed the rock along\r\nthe lines of their ascent; in the latter, a more resistant sort of\r\nigneous rock overlies a less resistant.\r\n\r\nStructural features, such as jointing, sometimes give rise to falls,\r\nor determine their distinctive features (Fig. 117), even where the\r\nformations involved are of uniform hardness. A joint plane has the\r\neffect of a weak vertical or highly inclined bed. If an open joint\r\nis discovered in a stream’s bed, the water enters it. If it finds an\r\noutlet below, a channel is worn along the new line of flow, with rapids\r\nor falls where the water descends. Rock originally homogeneous may be\r\nmuch fractured in some parts, while it remains unbroken in others.\r\nWhere a stream passes from the solid to the broken portion rapids, or\r\neven falls, may develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 115.—Diagram illustrating the development of\r\n  falls over a vertical hard layer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 116.—Diagram illustrating the possibility of\r\n  falls where the beds dip down-stream.]\r\n\r\nFalls may originate in still other ways. If for any reason a stream is\r\nforced out of its valley, it may in its flow find entrance to another\r\nvalley, or to another part of its own valley, over a steep slope. If\r\nthe structure of the slope favors, a fall may speedily develop. The\r\nFalls of St. Anthony are an example, the Mississippi having been turned\r\nout of its earlier course by deposits of glacial drift. Again, if an\r\nobstruction of any sort, such as a flow of lava, dams a stream, rapids\r\nor falls are developed where the water overflows the dam. When a main\r\nvalley is notably deepened by glaciation the drainage from tributary\r\nvalleys may fall into it, if the tributaries were not equally deepened.\r\nFalls which originated in this way are common in the western mountains\r\nof the United States, as well as in most mountain regions recently\r\naffected by local glaciers (Fig. 118).\r\n\r\nOne waterfall often breeds others. Thus where a fall recedes beyond\r\nthe mouth of a tributary stream, the tributary falls. The Falls of\r\nMinnehaha, on a small tributary to the Mississippi, near Minneapolis,\r\nmay serve as an illustration. In such cases the falls may not develop\r\nfrom rapids. Once in existence, the fall of a tributary follows the\r\nsame history as that of a main stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 117.—Kepler’s Cascade, in the Yellowstone Park.\r\n  The jointed and fractured character of the igneous rocks occasions a\r\n  series of falls and rapids. (Iddings, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nStreams which have falls are relatively clear.[51] If a stream\r\nfavorably situated for the development of a fall carried a heavy\r\nload, deposition would take place below the rapids, and the tendency\r\nwould be to aggrade the channel at that point and so to prevent\r\nthe development of the fall. Falls occur only on streams which have\r\nrelatively high gradients. This means that the streams which have falls\r\nare well above base-level, and streams well above base-level are young.\r\nFalls therefore are a mark of topographic youth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 118.—The Upper Yosemite Falls.]\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Niagara[52] (Pl. IX) is one of the most remarkable\r\nknown, both because of its large volume of water and its great descent,\r\nbetween 160 and 170 feet. The rate at which the fall is receding is a\r\nmatter of interest not only in itself, but because, once determined,\r\nit may be made to serve as a unit of measurement for certain important\r\nevents in geological history. It was formerly conjectured that this\r\nfall was receding at the rate of one to three feet per century, but\r\nit was not until recent years that its actual rate of recession was\r\napproximately fixed. By surveys executed in 1842 and 1890 it has been\r\ndetermined that its average rate of recession between those dates was\r\nsomething like 4½ feet per year, or about 150 times as great as the\r\nhighest estimate stated above. It is to be noted that this is the\r\n_average_ rate of recession, for all parts of the ledge over which\r\nthe water falls are not receding at the same rate. The point of the\r\n“Horseshoe” has, during the same time, gone back at more than twice\r\nthis rate.[53]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 119.—A group of pot-holes. (Turner, U. S. Geol.\r\n  Surv.)]\r\n\r\nRapids and falls sometimes occasion the development of _pot-holes_\r\n(Fig. 119), a peculiar rather than important erosion feature. The holes\r\nare excavated in part by the falling and eddying of silt-charged water,\r\nbut chiefly by stones which the eddies move. Pot-holes which are not\r\nnow in immediate association with rapids or falls often point to the\r\nformer existence of rapids or falls.\r\n\r\n=Rock terraces.=—The tendency to sapping shown in many waterfalls is\r\nalso shown in the weathering and erosion of the sides of a valley where\r\na hard layer outcrops above the bottom, and the profile of the side\r\nslopes of the valley simulates that of the stream; that is, the slope\r\nbecomes gentle just above the hard layer, and steep, or even vertical,\r\nat and below its outcrop. This is illustrated by Fig. 120, where the\r\nhard layer through which the stream has sunk its valley stands out as\r\na rock terrace on either side of the valley. Such terraces are not\r\nrare and are popularly believed to be old “water-lines”; that is,\r\nto represent the height at which the water once stood. In one sense\r\nthis interpretation is correct, since a river has stood at all levels\r\nbetween that of the surface in which its valley started, and its\r\npresent channel, but the shelf of hard rock does not mean that the\r\nriver, after attaining its present channel, was ever so large as to\r\nfill the valley to the level of the terrace. Rock terraces may also\r\nresult from changes of level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 120.—Diagram to illustrate the development of\r\n  rock terraces.]\r\n\r\n=Narrows.=—Inequalities in hardness occasion another peculiarity common\r\nto valleys. If a stream crosses vertical or highly inclined strata of\r\nunequal hardness, its valley is usually constricted at the crossing\r\nof the harder layers. If such a constriction be notable it is called\r\na _narrows_, or sometimes a _water-gap_ (Figs. 121, 159, and Fig. 2,\r\nPl. XII). The Appalachian Mountains afford numerous examples. The\r\nconstriction arises because the processes which widen the valley are\r\nless effective on the hard layer than on the less resistant ones on\r\neither hand. Though most narrows are due to the superior resistance\r\nof the rock where they occur, they are sometimes the result of other\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 121.—Lower narrows of the Baraboo River, Wis. The\r\n  even-crested ridge is Huronian quartzite. The surroundings are of\r\n  Cambrian sandstone. (Atwood.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 122.—A hog-back, Jura-Trias. Colorado City, Colo.\r\n  (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nNarrows are much more conspicuous in certain stages of erosion than\r\nin others. While a valley is still so young as to be narrow at all\r\npoints, no narrows will be conspicuous; but at a later stage in\r\nits history, when the valley is otherwise wide, narrows are more\r\npronounced. At a still later stage, when the hard strata themselves\r\napproach base-level, the narrows again become inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nFrom what has preceded it is clear that rapids or falls are likely to\r\noccur at narrows, especially in the early part of their history.\r\n\r\n=Other effects on topography.=—Inequalities in the hardness of rock\r\ndevelop certain peculiarities of topography other than those of\r\nvalleys. The less resistant portions of a land area more or less\r\ndistant from streams are worn down more readily than those which are\r\nmore resistant. If great areas of high land be capped with hard rock\r\nthey are likely to remain as plateaus after surrounding areas of\r\nless resistance are brought low. If the hard capping affects a small\r\narea instead of a large one, the elevation is a butte, a hill, or a\r\nmountain, instead of a plateau (Fig. 110). Many buttes and small mesas\r\nare but remnants of former plateaus (Mesa Lauriano, N. M., Fig. 1, Pl.\r\nXII). A feature of buttes and mesas capped by hard rock is the steep\r\nslope or cliff corresponding to the edge of the hard bed (Figs. 78 and\r\n109).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 123.—A ridge due to the outcropping edge of hard\r\n  Jurassic rock. Wyoming.]\r\n\r\nIf the rock of a region be stratified and the layers tilted, the\r\nremoval of the softer beds leaves the harder ones projecting above\r\nthe general level in the form of ridges or “hog-backs” (Figs. 122\r\nand 123). Dikes of igneous rock, harder than the beds which they\r\nintersect, likewise become ridges after the degradation of their\r\nsurroundings. The plugs of old volcanic vents and other igneous\r\nintrusions of limited area often constitute conspicuous hills or\r\nmountains after erosion has removed their less resistant surroundings\r\n(Fig. 124). Inequalities of hardness are therefore responsible for many\r\nhills and ridges. In the isolation of the hills and ridges picturesque\r\ncoves are developed, where the attitude and distribution of the weak\r\nand strong rocks are propitious. The bottoms of the coves are located\r\non the weak rocks, and above them rise the precipitous slopes of\r\nthe resistant ones. Round valley (Fig. 1, Pl. XVII, High Bridge, N.\r\nJ., quadrangle, U.

Co.)]\r\n\r\nRidges and hills resulting from the unequal degradation of unequally\r\nresistant terranes are not equally prominent at all stages in an\r\nerosion cycle. In early youth the material surrounding the hard bodies\r\nof rock has not been removed; in early maturity considerable portions\r\nof their surroundings still remain about them; but in late maturity\r\nor early old age the outcropping masses of hard rock have been more\r\nperfectly isolated and are most conspicuous. Most of the even-crested\r\nridges of the Appalachian system, as well as many others which might be\r\nmentioned, became ridges in this way. In the final stages of an erosion\r\ncycle the ridges of hard rock are themselves brought low. Isolated\r\nremnants of hard rock which remain distinctly above their surroundings\r\nin the late stages of an erosion cycle (Fig. 124) are known as\r\n_Monadnocks_, the name being derived from Mount Monadnock, N. H., an\r\nelevation of this sort developed in a cycle antedating the present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 125–27.—Diagrams illustrating piracy, where the\r\n  stream which does not flow over rock of superior hardness captures\r\n  those which do. Fig. 126 represents a further development of the\r\n  drainage shown in Fig. 125, and Fig. 127 represents a still later\r\n  stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 128–30.—Diagrams to illustrate piracy, where\r\n  the competing streams all cross a hard layer. The diagrams represent\r\n  successive stages of development.]\r\n\r\n=Adjustment of streams to rock structures.=—Valleys (gullies) locate\r\nthemselves at the outset without immediate regard to the hardness and\r\nsoftness of their beds. It is primarily the slope about the head of a\r\ngully which determines its line of growth, though relative hardness\r\noften determines the details of slope, even in the early stages of an\r\nerosion cycle. Once established, streams tend to hold their courses,\r\neven if this involves the crossing of resistant layers.\r\n\r\nWhile a region where more and less resistant layers of rock come to the\r\nsurface is in a youthful stage of erosion, some of the valleys (and\r\ntherefore the streams) are likely to be located on the less resistant\r\nrock, some on the more resistant, and some partly on the one and partly\r\non the other. The streams on the weaker rock will deepen their valleys\r\nmore rapidly than the others, and those which flow across stronger\r\nand weaker rocks alternately will deepen their valleys more rapidly\r\nthan those which run on hard rock all the time. The former conclusion\r\nis self-evident. The latter appears from the fact that rapids will be\r\nlikely to develop at the crossing of each hard layer, thus accelerating\r\nerosion at those points. Such a stream therefore not only has less hard\r\nrock to erode than one which flows on resistant rock all the time, but\r\nit erodes that which it does cross much faster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 131, 132.—The capture of the head of Beaverdam\r\n  Creek by the Shenandoah Va.-W. Va. (After Willis.)]\r\n\r\nStreams which do not cross hard layers therefore have an advantage\r\nover those which do, and the tributaries to such streams, since they\r\njoin deeper mains, have an advantage over the tributaries to the\r\nothers. The valleys of the former may lengthen until their heads reach\r\nthe latter, and capture their streams. This sequence of events is\r\nillustrated in the accompanying diagrams (Figs. 125–27). Even where\r\nseveral streams cross the same resistant bed, piracy is likely to take\r\nplace among them, for some are sure to deepen their valleys faster than\r\nothers, because of inequalities of volume, load, or hardness. This is\r\nillustrated by Figs. 128–30. An actual case is shown in Figs. 131,\r\n132. Though piracy may take place when streams do not flow over rock\r\nof unequal hardness (p. 103), it is much more common where unequal\r\nresistance of the rock puts one stream at a disadvantage as compared\r\nwith another.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the courses of streams, by means of which they come to\r\nsustain definite and stable relations to the rock structure beneath,\r\nare known as processes of _adjustment_.[54] Since streams and valleys\r\nadjust themselves to other conditions as well, this phase of adjustment\r\nmay be called _structural adjustment_. Structural adjustment is not\r\nuncommon among rivers flowing over strata which are vertical or highly\r\ninclined, since in these positions the hard and soft strata are most\r\nlikely to come to the surface in frequent alternation. The smaller\r\nstreams suffer capture and adjustment first, since, as a rule, they\r\nhave shallower valleys. It often happens that main streams, because of\r\ntheir deeper valleys, hold courses not in adjustment with structure\r\n(the Delaware, the Susquehanna, etc.), while tributary streams are\r\ncaptured, diverted, and adjusted. The capture of a tributary, however,\r\nleads both to the diminution of its main and to the increase of its\r\ncaptor, and the weakened stream may ultimately fall a prey to the one\r\nwhich is strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe processes of adjustment go on until the streams flow as much as\r\npossible on the weaker beds, and as little as possible on the stronger,\r\nwhen adjustment is complete. This amounts to the same thing as saying\r\nthat the outcrops of the hard layers tend to become divides. In many\r\ncases an area is so situated that there is no escape for its drainage\r\nexcept across resistant rock. In this case its drainage is completely\r\nadjusted when as few streams as possible cross the resistant rock, and\r\nthese by the shortest routes.\r\n\r\nAdjustment has been carried to a high degree of perfection in most\r\nparts of the Appalachian system. Here, as in all other mountains of\r\nsimilar structure, strata of unequal hardness were folded into ridges.\r\nIn this case, the folds have been truncated by erosion, exposing\r\nthe more and the less resistant beds (_H_ and _S_ respectively) in\r\nalternate belts along the flanks of the truncated folds (_ab_ and\r\n_cd_, Fig. 133). The streams, especially the lesser ones, now flow\r\nalong the strike of the softer beds much more commonly than elsewhere,\r\nand where they cross the hard layers it is usually at right angles to\r\nthe strike. This is shown in Fig. 134, where the arrows indicate the\r\ndirection of strike. In the history of these rivers, however, a factor\r\nis involved which has not yet been considered, and these streams will\r\nbe referred to later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 133.—Diagram showing the outcrops of hard layers\r\n  on the flanks of a truncated fold. _cd_ represents the present\r\n  surface; dotted lines above, earlier surfaces.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 134.—Example of adjusted drainage in a region of\r\n  folded rocks, Va.-W. Va.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 135.—Diagram to illustrate readjustment of\r\n  drainage, as base-level is approached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 136.—Diagram to illustrate superimposition. The\r\n  consequent stream on the upper formation is superimposed on the\r\n  underlying structures when the upper bed has been cut through.]\r\n\r\nAs base-level is approached, the outcrops of hard rock are brought\r\nlow. When they have been reduced to the level of their surroundings,\r\nthe streams may flow without regard to the resistance of the rock\r\nbeneath, for downward cutting has ceased. As this stage of erosion is\r\napproached, a readjustment of the drainage may take place, and the\r\nwaters which had taken long and circuitous courses to avoid hard rock,\r\nmay change their courses to more direct ones (compare Figs. 130 and\r\n135). Adjustment is, therefore, a relative term, and streams which\r\nare adjusted at one stage of erosion, are not necessarily adjusted at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that rocks of unequal resistance are covered\r\nby beds of uniform hardness. A consequent stream developed on the\r\nlatter may find itself out of structural adjustment when it has cut\r\nits channel down to the level of the heterogeneous beds below. Such\r\na stream is said to be _superimposed_ (Fig. 136) on the underlying\r\nstructure. Structural adjustment is likely to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INFLUENCE OF JOINTS AND FOLDS.\r\n\r\n=Joints.=—Various structural features of rock other than hardness\r\ninfluence its erosion. Apart from the stratification planes, most rock\r\nformations are affected by joints or fissures. The joints are often,\r\nbut not always, nearly vertical. Two sets are generally present, and\r\nsometimes more. If but two, they usually meet at a large angle; if more\r\nthan two, two are likely to be nearly perpendicular to each other,\r\nwhile the third and fourth sets have such directions as to cut the\r\nothers at large angles. These joints allow the ingress of water, roots,\r\netc., which help to weather and disrupt rocks. Occasionally there is\r\nnotable sag of the beds of rock along joint planes, but this effect\r\nis usually superficial only (Fig. 137). Where the jointage planes are\r\nfrequent and open, the columns bounded by them sometimes topple over on\r\ncliff faces, either by undercutting, or by the wedge-work of roots or\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe effect of joints on erosion may often be seen along a stream\r\nwhich flows in a rock gorge. In such situations, the outlines of the\r\nbanks are sometimes angular, and sometimes crenate (Fig. 138), the\r\nreëntrants being located at the joints. By working into and widening\r\njoints, running water sometimes isolates masses of rock as islands\r\n(Fig. 139). In a region free from mantle rock, or where the mantle rock\r\nis meagre, joints often determine the courses of valleys by directing\r\nthe course of surface drainage. This is shown in many parts of the\r\narid west. In regions where the rocks are notably faulted, the courses\r\nof the streams are sometimes controlled by the courses of the fault\r\nplanes. This is the case, for example, in central Washington.[55]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 137.—Shows the sagging of beds along joints. The\r\n  disturbance does not extend far below the surface. Cook’s quarry\r\n  (Niagara limestone) near La Salle, Niagara Co., N. Y. (Gilbert, U. S.\r\n  Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe jointing of rocks often shows itself distinctly in the weathered\r\nfaces of cliffs (Figs. 140 and 141), especially in arid and semi-arid\r\nregions, or where the slope is too steep for the accumulation of soil\r\nand rock-waste on its surface.\r\n\r\nIf a stream flowing over jointed rock has falls, the conditions are\r\nsometimes afforded for the development of an exceptional and striking\r\nscenic feature. If above Niagara Falls, for example, there were an\r\nopen joint in the bed of the stream (as at _b_, Fig. 142), some portion\r\nof the water would descend through it. After reaching a lower level\r\nit might find or make a passage through the rock to the river below\r\nthe falls. If even a little water took such a course, the flow would\r\nenlarge its channel, making a passageway between the joint through\r\nwhich the water descended and the valley below the falls (_bcde_, Fig.\r\n142). This passageway might become large enough to accommodate all the\r\nwater of the river. In this case, the entire fall would be transferred\r\nfrom the position which it previously occupied (_f_) to the position of\r\nthe enlarged joint (_b_). The fall would then recede. The underground\r\nchannel between the old falls and the new would be bridged by rock\r\n(_bf″_ and _f‴_, Fig. 143), making a _natural bridge_. The natural\r\nbridge near Lexington, Va. (Fig. 144), almost 200 feet above the stream\r\nwhich flows beneath it, is believed to have been developed in this\r\nway. A similar bridge is now in process of development in Two Medicine\r\nRiver in northwestern Montana (Fig. 145). Once in existence, a natural\r\nbridge will slowly weather away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 138.—Figure showing crenate river bank, the\r\n  reëntrants being determined by joints.

Surv.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood that all natural bridges have had this\r\nhistory. They are sometimes developed from underground caves when parts\r\nof their roofs are destroyed, as well as in various other ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 141.—Effect of columnar structure on weathering.\r\n  Big Bad Lands, S. D. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Folds.=—The erosion of folded strata (anticlines and synclines) leads\r\nto the development of distinctive topographic features. So soon as a\r\nfold begins to be lifted, it is, by reason of its position, subject\r\nto more rapid erosion than its surroundings. For the same reason the\r\ncrest of the fold is likely to be degraded more rapidly than its lower\r\nslopes, and must suffer more degradation before it is brought to\r\nbase-level. Folds are usually composed of beds of unequal resistance,\r\nand as the degradation of a fold proceeds, successive layers are worn\r\nfrom the top, and the alternating hard and soft layers composing it are\r\nexposed. So soon as this is accomplished, adjustment of the streams\r\nis likely to begin, and the watercourses, and later the valley plains,\r\ncome to be located on the outcrops of the less resistant layers, while\r\nthe outcrops of the harder beds become ridges.\r\n\r\nIf the axis of an eroded anticline were horizontal, a given hard layer,\r\nthe arch of which has been cut off, would, after erosion, outcrop on\r\nboth sides of the axis. When the topography was mature these outcrops\r\nwould constitute parallel ridges, or parallel lines of hills; when the\r\nregion had been base-leveled, the outcrops would be in parallel belts,\r\nthough no longer ridges or hills. The lower the plane of truncation,\r\nthe farther apart would the outcrops be in the anticline, and the\r\nnearer together in the syncline (compare _ab_ and _cd_, Fig. 133).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 142.—A natural bridge in process of development;\r\n  longitudinal section at the left; transverse section, looking toward\r\n  _e_, at the right.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the axis of the anticline or syncline to be\r\neroded was not horizontal, that is, if it _plunged_, the topographic\r\nresult would be somewhat different. Suppose a plunging anticline to\r\nbe truncated at base-level. If either end of the fold plunged below\r\nthe plane of truncation, the outcrops of a given layer on opposite\r\nsides of the axis would converge in the direction of plunge, and come\r\ntogether at the end. At a stage of erosion antedating planation (say\r\nlate maturity) there would have been a ridge, or a succession of hills,\r\nin the position corresponding to the outcrop of a hard layer, with a\r\ncanoe-shaped valley within. If two hard layers were involved, instead\r\nof one, there would be two encircling ridges, with a curved valley\r\nbetween them, and a canoe-shaped valley within the innermost (Fig.\r\n146). If the anticline plunged both ways, the valley enclosed by\r\nthe hard-layer ridge would be canoe-shaped at both ends (Fig. 147).\r\nIn such a case there would be likely to be a low gap (water-gap) in\r\nthe rim of the valley through which the drainage which degraded the\r\nsurface escaped, but there would be likely to be but one, for if\r\ntwo or more streams had drained the area of the valley at an early\r\nstage of erosion, one would be likely to have captured the others\r\n(see p. 138) before late maturity. A succession of doubly-plunging\r\nanticlines and synclines might give rise to a very complex series of\r\nridges and valleys. Illustrations of the above phenomena are found at\r\nvarious points in the Appalachian Mountains, especially in eastern\r\nPennsylvania.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 143.—The same as Fig. 142 at a later stage of\r\n  development.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 144.—The Natural Bridge of Virginia, from the\r\n  southeast (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 145.—A natural bridge in development. Two\r\n  Medicine River, Mont. Corresponds to the stage represented by Fig.\r\n  142, and the view corresponds to that shown diagrammatically at the\r\n  right-hand end of the figure. (Whitney.)]\r\n\r\nIn the structural adjustment which goes with the erosion of\r\nfolds, it often happens that the valleys come to be located on the\r\nanticlines, while the outcrops of the hard layers on the flanks of the\r\nanticlines, or even in the original synclines, become the mountains.\r\nThe adjustments by which valleys come to be located on anticlines\r\nare somewhat as follows:[57] Fig. 148 represents two doubly-plunging\r\nanticlines with a syncline between, the relative elevations being shown\r\nby contour lines. At the outset, the drainage of such a region must\r\nhave followed the structural valley, and its initial course, consequent\r\non the slope, must have been down the axial trough. Drainage from the\r\nanticlines into the synclines would have promptly developed valleys,\r\nand the valleys would soon have acquired streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 146.—A canoe-shaped valley bordered by a ridge\r\n  formed by the outcrop of a hard layer in a plunging syncline. The\r\n  ridge bounding the canoe-valley is separated from an outer ridge by a\r\n  curved valley underlain by relatively weak rock. (After Willis.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 147.—A diagram to illustrate the effects of\r\n  erosion on a doubly-plunging anticline made up of beds of unequal\r\n  hardness.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 148–51.—Diagrams to illustrate the shifting of\r\n  rivers from a synclinal to an anticlinal position. (After Davis.)]\r\n\r\nThe anticlines and synclines under consideration are assumed to have a\r\nthick hard layer at the surface, and softer beds below. This is shown\r\nin the cross-section introduced in the figure, the upper hard stratum\r\n(_m_) being indicated by the dots, while the softer one (_n_) is white.\r\nThe line _oo_ represents base-level, which is below the hard layer both\r\nin the syncline and anticline, but much farther below in the latter\r\nposition than in the former. Because of their higher gradients, and\r\nbecause of the greater fracturing to which the region they drain was\r\npresumably subject at the time of folding, the tributary streams might\r\ncut through the hard layer sooner than the main stream which they join.\r\nThis done, they would enlarge their valleys rapidly in the softer rock\r\nbeneath, and secondary tributaries would be developed (Fig. 149). When\r\nthe condition of things represented in Fig. 149 is reached, the streams\r\n_c_ and _d_, tributary to the synclinal stream, come into competition.\r\nThe former has the advantage over the latter, because it joins the\r\nmain stream at a lower level. Stream _c_ will therefore be likely to\r\ncapture _d_. The incipient stages of the capture are stealthy, and the\r\nlater bold. At first the divide between their head waters is shifted\r\nnorthward inch by inch, because the gradient toward _g_ is higher than\r\nthat toward _e_. The capture of the head waters of _e_ is as slow as\r\nthe migration of the divide, until the divide reaches the point where\r\n_e_ joins _f_. The stream _f_ is then diverted promptly into the valley\r\nof _g_, and is at once led away to _c_ (see Fig. 150). Strengthened\r\nby its increased volume, the stream _c_ (Fig. 150) lowers its valley\r\nacross the hard layer more rapidly than before, and so holds the\r\nadvantage it has gained. Not only this, but the beheaded stream _d_\r\n(Fig. 150), because of its diminished volume, sinks its valley into the\r\nhard layer less rapidly than before, and its decrease in power also\r\nworks to the advantage of the stream leading to _c_. The result is that\r\nthe divide between _fg_ and _d_ does not remain constant, but is driven\r\nback step by step toward _a_.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a tributary to the main stream at _b_ (Fig. 150), may by\r\nmeans of its tributary _h_, capture the waters of _fg_, and lead them\r\nto the synclinal valley at _b_ (compare Figs. 150 and 151). Deprived\r\nof its main source of supply (at _c_) the synclinal stream is greatly\r\ndiminished above _b_, and cuts more and more slowly, while the stream\r\n_fgh_ (Fig. 151), having greater volume and working mainly in softer\r\nrock, sinks its channel faster than the stream in the synclinal axis.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the stream at _f_ may cut its valley below\r\nthe valley in the synclinal axis _a_ (Fig. 150). In this event, the\r\ndivide between _f_ and _a_ (Fig. 150) may be pushed back until the\r\nsynclinal stream is beheaded at _a_ and carried out of the syncline and\r\nover into the anticlinal valley (Fig. 151). Thus, the old anticlinal\r\naxis comes to be the course of the main stream. Similarly the stream\r\nentering the syncline at _b_ (Fig. 151) might later be captured by _i_,\r\nthus lengthening its anticlinal course.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood that this sequence of events will take\r\nplace in the degradation of every anticline, but the principles here\r\nset forth will always be operative. The result specified will be\r\naccomplished wherever hard and soft layers have the relations indicated\r\nin the diagrams; that is, where the stream in the syncline finds itself\r\non a resistant layer as it approaches base-level, while at the same\r\ntime the (original) tributary streams are working in softer beds. It is\r\nnot to be understood, therefore, that streams migrate from synclines to\r\nanticlines for the sake of getting out of the former positions into the\r\nlatter. If they shift their courses it is to find easier ones.\r\n\r\nThat these changes are not fanciful is shown by the fact that the\r\nadjustment described corresponds with that shown in many parts of the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, and in other mountains of similar structure.\r\n\r\nIf in a later stage of its history, the new main stream, _fh_, were\r\nto cut its bed down to a lower hard layer, while the original stream,\r\n_ab_, reached a softer bed beneath the hard one above, the latter would\r\nagain have an advantage, and a new series of adjustments would be\r\ninaugurated which might result in re-establishing the main stream in\r\nits original synclinal position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EFFECT OF CHANGES OF LEVEL.\r\n\r\n=Rise.=—If after being base-leveled, or notably reduced by erosion, a\r\nregion is uplifted so as to increase the gradients and therefore the\r\nvelocities of the streams which drain it, the streams are said to be\r\n_rejuvenated_, and a new cycle of erosion is begun. If the rise of the\r\narea were equal everywhere, while the coast line remained constant\r\nin position, there would be an immediate increase in velocity only\r\nat the debouchures of the streams flowing directly into the sea.\r\nAt the debouchures of such streams there would be rapids or falls.\r\nEach rapids or falls would promptly recede, and with the recession,\r\nthe acceleration of velocity resulting from the uplift would be felt\r\nfarther and farther up-stream, and ultimately to its source. The\r\nrejuvenated streams would cut new valleys in the bottoms of their\r\nold ones (Figs. 152 and 153). The new valleys would begin where the\r\nincrease in velocity was first felt, and they would be lengthened by\r\nhead erosion just as valleys of the first cycle were lengthened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 152.—Cross-section of a wide valley, _ab_, in the\r\n  bottom of which a younger valley, _cd_, has been excavated as the\r\n  result of uplift.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 153.—Diagram to illustrate in ground plan an\r\n  ideal case of rejuvenation as the result of uplift.]\r\n\r\nWhen the head of the new part of a valley of a rejuvenated stream\r\nrecedes past the mouth of a tributary adjusted[58] to the gradient of\r\nthe main stream before rejuvenation, the velocity of the tributary\r\nis accelerated at its debouchure, and it begins to excavate a new\r\nvalley in the bottom of its old one. The new valley commences at the\r\nlower end of the old one, and develops headward (_a_ and _b_, Fig.\r\n153). Good illustrations are furnished by the streams in the west\r\ncentral part of New Jersey. The Delaware has here a sharply defined\r\nvalley, and its tributaries are essentially as deep as their main at\r\nthe point of junction. Above this point they have high gradients for a\r\nshort distance (three to six miles), beyond which they wind sluggishly\r\nin wide valleys with low gradients across a relatively high plateau.\r\nTheir profiles are illustrated by Fig. 154. The flat, though high,\r\nsurface in which their upper courses lie, appears to have been nearly\r\nbase-leveled in an earlier cycle, and then to have been elevated.\r\nThe date of the elevation is fixed, in terms of erosion, by the time\r\nnecessary for the excavation of the Delaware gorge, and the narrow\r\ngorges along the lower courses of its tributaries. It was so recent\r\nthat the effects of rejuvenation, proceeding from the debouchures of\r\nthe tributaries toward their heads, have not yet advanced far from the\r\nDelaware. Similar relations are found elsewhere (Fig. 1, Pl. XIII,\r\ns. c. Col.). Another peculiarity of rejuvenated drainage is shown in\r\nFig. 2, Plate XIII (s. Kan.). Here Elm Creek flows at a level 200 feet\r\nbelow that of Sand Creek, 4 miles distant. The valley of the former\r\nappears to have entered upon a new cycle as the result of uplift,\r\nwhile that of the latter, _in the area shown on the map_, is still\r\nunrejuvenated. Farther down-stream, the valley of Sand Creek shows\r\nsigns of rejuvenation. It may be noted that a tributary of Amber Creek\r\nhas good opportunity to capture Sand Creek, for the latter flows about\r\n25 miles before reaching the level of Amber Creek at its junction with\r\nElm Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.

J.) to the head of Mud Run.]\r\n\r\nShould the lower end of a tributary valley fail to be degraded as fast\r\nas the valley of the main at the point of junction, the tributary is\r\nout of _topographic adjustment_ with its main. Falls or rapids may\r\nresult. When the lower end of a tributary valley is distinctly above\r\nthe level of its main, the former is called a _hanging valley_. Hanging\r\nvalleys developed by stream erosion alone are not common except just\r\nafter the recession of a falls past the mouth of a tributary. Hanging\r\nvalleys, as well as the characters and relations illustrated by Figs.\r\n152–154 are criteria of rejuvenation, but they must be applied with\r\ndiscretion. Such profiles, for example, as that shown in Fig. 154 may\r\nbe developed when the rock of a stream’s bed is unequally resistant,\r\nand hanging valleys are generally a result of glaciation (see Chapter\r\nV).\r\n\r\nRejuvenated streams sometimes inherit certain peculiarities from their\r\naged ancestors. Thus a rejuvenated stream may intrench the meanders\r\npossessed by the old stream which preceded (see Fig. 1, Pl. XIV, near\r\nHarrisburg, Pa.), and intrenched meanders are one of the marks of\r\nrejuvenated streams. They are not uncommon in the Appalachian Mountain\r\nregions, and are known in other parts of the world. The Seine and the\r\nMoselle furnish further illustrations.[59]\r\n\r\nThe history of the new cycle of erosion inaugurated by the uplift would\r\ndiffer from that of the preceding cycle in that the new one would begin\r\nwith a drainage system already developed. Other things being equal,\r\ntherefore, the reduction of the land would proceed more rapidly in a\r\nsubsequent cycle than in the first.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of different cycles of erosion, separated by uplifts,\r\nis often easy. The principles involved are illustrated by Fig. 155\r\nwhich represents an ideal profile of considerable length (say 50\r\nmiles). The points _a_, _a′_, and _a″_ reach a common level. Below\r\nthem there are areas _b_, _b′_, and _b″_ which have a nearly common\r\nelevation, below which are the sharp valleys _d_, _d′_, and _d″_. The\r\npoints _a_, _a′_, and _a″_ represent the cross-sections of ridges\r\nformed by the outcrops of layers of hard rock. If the crests of the\r\nridges are level, the points _a_, _a′_, and _a″_ must represent\r\nremnants of an old base-level, _since at no time after a ridge of hard\r\nrock becomes deeply notched does it acquire an even crest, until it is\r\nbase-leveled_.[60] At all earlier stages its crest is uneven. After the\r\ncycle represented by the remnants _a_, _a′_, and _a″_ was completed,\r\nthe region suffered uplift. A new cycle represented by the plain _b_,\r\n_b′_, and _b″_ was well advanced, though not completed, when the region\r\nwas again elevated, and the rejuvenated streams began to cut their\r\nvalleys _d_, _d′_, and _d″_ in the plain of the previous incomplete\r\ncycle. The elevations, _c_ and _c′_ (intermediate in elevation between\r\n_a_, _a′_, and _a″_, and _b_, _b′_, and _b″_) may represent either\r\nremnants of the first base-level plain which were lowered, but not\r\nobliterated, while the plane _b, b′, b″_ was developing; or they may\r\nrepresent a cycle intermediate between that during which _a, a′, a″_\r\nand _b, b′, b″_ were developed. If the intermediate elevations (_c,\r\nc′_) have a common height and level crests, the presumption would be in\r\nfavor of the latter interpretation. If they be numerous and of varying\r\nheights, as is possible, they may in the field obscure the planes (_a,\r\na′, a″_ and _b, b′, b″_) developed in the different cycles, which, in\r\nthe figure, are distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 155.—Diagram to illustrate cycles of erosion\r\n  where the beds are tilted.]\r\n\r\nIf the strata involved be horizontal the determination of cycles is\r\nsometimes less easy. Thus in Fig. 156, it is not possible to say\r\nwhether _a_ and _a′_ represent remnants of an old base-level, or\r\nwhether they represent the original surface from which degradation\r\nstarted. So, too, the various benches below _a_, such as _b_, _b′_, and\r\n_b″_ may readily be the result of the superior hardness of the beds at\r\nthis level. For the determination of successive uplifts in the field it\r\nis necessary to consider areas of considerable size, and to eliminate\r\nthe topographic effects of inequalities of hardness, and of certain\r\nother factors to be mentioned presently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 156.—Diagram to illustrate cycles of erosion\r\n  where the beds are horizontal.]\r\n\r\nThe inequalities in the depths of the young valleys in Figs. 155 and\r\n156 may be explained on the supposition that the deeper ones belong to\r\nmain streams, and the shallower ones to tributaries. Such a valley as\r\nthat shown at _e_, Fig. 155, suggests rejuvenation at this point; but\r\nfarther up the stream which occupies this valley, rejuvenation might\r\nnot be apparent. In this case, the main streams might be flowing in new\r\nvalleys, _d, d′_, etc., while the heads of their tributaries are still\r\nflowing in the older valleys of the preceding cycle (compare Fig. 154\r\nand Fig. 1, Pl. XIII).\r\n\r\nIt is by the application of the preceding principles that it is known\r\nthat the Appalachian Mountains, after being folded, were reduced to\r\na peneplain (p. 76), throughout their whole extent from the Hudson\r\nRiver to Alabama. The peneplain level is indicated by the level\r\ncrests of the Appalachian ridges, shown in cross profile by the high\r\npoints of Fig. 157. The system was then uplifted, and in the cycle\r\nof erosion which followed, broad plains were developed at a new and\r\nlower level, corresponding in a general way to the plains _b_, _b′_,\r\nand _b″_ of Fig. 155. The plains were located, for the most part,\r\nwhere the less resistant strata come to the surface. Above them rose\r\neven-crested ridges, the outcrops of the resistant layers, which\r\nhad been isolated by the degradation of the softer beds between.\r\nThey constitute the present mountain ridges (the high points of Fig.\r\n157). The evenness of their crests, testifying to the completeness\r\nof the first peneplanation, is shown in Fig. 158, which represents,\r\ndiagrammatically, a longitudinal profile of an Appalachian Mountain\r\nridge. The evenness of the crest is interrupted by (1) notches (_b,\r\nc_, etc., Fig. 158) cut by the streams in later cycles, and (2) by\r\noccasional elevations above the common level (monadnocks, _a, a′_, Fig.\r\n158). The monadnocks are generally rather inconspicuous, but there is a\r\nnotable group of them in North Carolina and Tennessee. Mount Mitchell\r\nand Roane Mountain are examples. When long distances are considered,\r\nthe ridge crests depart somewhat from horizontality. This is believed\r\nto be due, in part at least, to deformations of the old peneplain\r\nduring the uplift which inaugurated the second cycle of erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 157.—Cross-section of a portion of the\r\n  Appalachian Mountains to illustrate the phenomena of erosion cycles.\r\n  (After Rogers.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 158.—A diagrammatic longitudinal profile of an\r\n  Appalachian Mountain ridge.]\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the second cycle of erosion recorded in the\r\npresent topography had proceeded before its interruption by uplift,\r\nis indicated by the extent of the valley plains (Fig. 157) below the\r\nmountain ridges. While these plains were being developed on the weak\r\nrocks, narrow valleys only (Fig. 158) were cut in the resistant rocks\r\nwhich now stood out as ridges. In Fig. 158 some of these valleys are\r\nshallow (_c, c′, c″_, etc.), and but one of them deep. The former may\r\nbe either (1) the valleys of streams which crossed the hard layer\r\nat the beginning of the cycle, and which were diverted before their\r\nvalleys became deep; or (2) they may represent the heads of valleys\r\nnow working back into the ridges. The deep valley (_b_) represents the\r\nwork of a stream which has held its course across the hard layer while\r\nthe latter was being isolated as a mountain ridge (compare Figs. 131\r\nand 132). Deep narrows of this sort are often called _water-gaps_.\r\nSimilar valleys, whether shallow or deep, from which drainage has\r\nbeen diverted, are sometimes called _wind-gaps_. The second cycle of\r\nerosion, while still far from complete, was interrupted by uplift\r\n(relative or absolute), and a new cycle inaugurated. This event was so\r\nrecent that the new (third) cycle has not yet advanced far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 159.—The Kittatinny Mountains and Delaware\r\n  Water-Gap from Manunka Chunk. (N. J. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nRecently it has been urged that another cycle, intermediate between the\r\nfirst and second, is to be recognized.[61]\r\n\r\nSome of the features just described are illustrated by Fig. 159. The\r\neven mountain crest in the background is the Kittatinny Mountain of\r\nNew Jersey and its continuation in Pennsylvania. In common with other\r\ncorresponding crests it represents the oldest recorded base-level (or\r\npeneplain) of the region. The great gap in the mountain is the Delaware\r\nWater-Gap. Below the mountain crest there is another plain, developed\r\nin a subsequent cycle of erosion, while the valley plain in the\r\nforeground represents the work of a still later cycle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 160.—Showing certain peculiarities of Appalachian\r\n  drainage. 1 = the Susquehanna; 2 = the Potomac; 3 = the James; 4 =\r\n  the Roanoke; 5= the Coosa; 6 = the Tennessee; 7 = the Kanawha; 8 =\r\n  head of New River; 9 = head of the French Broad.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest erosion plain of the Appalachian Mountains, the results of\r\nwhich are seen in the even-crested ridges so characteristic of the\r\nsystem, is sometimes called the _Kittatinny base-level_.[1] It was\r\ncompleted early in the Cretaceous period, and hence is sometimes known\r\nas the _Cretaceous base-level_. The next lower plain, imperfectly\r\ndeveloped, has been called the Shenandoah Plain,[62] from the\r\nShenandoah Valley where it is well seen (Fig. 132 and Fig. 2, Pl. XII).\r\nIt is to be noted that the terms _base-level_ and _peneplain_ have\r\nboth been used in connection with these old plains. _Graded plain_ is\r\nequally applicable. The truth is that the topographic types represented\r\nby these three terms grade into one another. It may be questioned\r\nwhether definitions should be insisted on which differentiate these\r\ntypes more sharply than Nature has.\r\n\r\nMany of the peculiarities of the drainage of the Appalachian Mountain\r\nsystem are intimately connected with the history just outlined. Thus\r\nthree great rivers, the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac,\r\nhave their sources west of the Appalachians proper, cross the system\r\nin apparent disregard of the structure, and flow into the Atlantic.\r\nThe James and Roanoke head far to the west, although not beyond the\r\nmountain system, and flow eastward, while the New River (leading to\r\nthe Kanawha) farther south, heads east of the mountain-folds, and\r\nflows northwestward across the alternating hard and soft beds of the\r\nwhole Appalachian system, to the Ohio (Fig. 160). The French Broad,\r\na tributary to the Tennessee, has a similar course. Such streams are\r\nclearly not in structural adjustment, and afford good opportunities\r\nfor piracy. Their courses were apparently assumed during the time of\r\nthe Kittatinny base-level, when the streams had so low a gradient as\r\nnot to be affected by the structure (p. 150). Elevation rejuvenated\r\nthem, and they have held their courses in succeeding cycles across beds\r\nof unequal resistance, though smaller streams have become somewhat\r\nthoroughly adjusted. Crustal deformations have also helped them to hold\r\ntheir courses, for the Cretaceous peneplain seems to have been tilted\r\nto the southeast at its northern end, and to the southwest at its\r\nsouthern, when the succeeding cycle began.\r\n\r\nStreams which hold their early courses in spite of changes which\r\nhave taken place since their courses were assumed are said to\r\nbe _antecedent_. They antedate the crustal movements which, but\r\nfor pre-existent streams, would have given origin to a different\r\narrangement of river courses. As a result of crustal movements,\r\ntherefore, a consequent stream may become antecedent. Master streams\r\nare more likely to hold their courses, and therefore to become\r\nantecedent, than subordinate ones.\r\n\r\nThe uplift of base-leveled beds, especially if the beds are tilted so\r\nas to bring layers of unequal resistance to the surface at frequent\r\nintervals, affords conditions favorable for extensive adjustment. The\r\nnumerous wind-gaps in the mountain ridges, representing the abandoned\r\ncourses of minor streams, and the less numerous water-gaps, which\r\nindicate the resistance of large streams to structural adjustment, are\r\ninstructive witnesses of the extent to which adjustment has gone. So\r\nextensive has been the adjustment among the streams of the Appalachian\r\nMountains that there is probably no considerable stream in the whole\r\nsystem which has not gained or lost through its own or its neighbors’\r\npiracy. The history of the rivers of the Appalachian Mountains has been\r\nfurther complicated by a considerable amount of warping during the\r\nperiods of uplift.[63]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 161, 162.—Diagrams to illustrate the effect of\r\n  crustal warping on stream erosion. The dotted lines represent the\r\n  profiles of the streams before deformation; the full lines, after.\r\n  Erosion will be stimulated between _a_ and _b_ in each case, and\r\n  between _c_ and _d_ in Fig. 162. Below _b_, Fig. 161, the stream\r\n  will be drowned, and erosion therefore stopped. Erosion will also be\r\n  stopped or retarded above _a_, between _b_ and _c_, and below _d_ in\r\n  Fig. 162.]\r\n\r\n=Sinking.=—The land on which a river system is developed may be\r\ndepressed relative to sea-level. In this case the sea would occupy\r\nthe lower ends of valleys, converting them into bays and estuaries. A\r\nstream in this condition is said to be _drowned_. Of drowned rivers\r\nthere are many examples along the Atlantic coast. Thus the St.\r\nLawrence River is drowned up to Montreal, and the Hudson up to Albany.\r\nIf the drowned portion of the latter valley were not so narrow, it\r\nwould be a bay. Delaware and Chesapeake Bays, as well as many smaller\r\nones, both north and south, are likewise the drowned ends of river\r\nvalleys (see figures, Chapter VI). If all parts of a drainage basin\r\nsank equally, the velocities of the streams above the limit of drowning\r\nwould not be changed, for the gradients would remain the same as\r\nbefore. The fact that a river’s channel is below sea-level is not to\r\nbe taken as proof that the valley is drowned. Thus the bottom of the\r\nchannel of the Mississippi is as much as 100 feet below the level of\r\nthe Gulf, some 20 miles above New Orleans.[64]\r\n\r\n=Differential movement. Warping.=—Where a land surface on which a river\r\nsystem is established suffers warping, some parts going up and others\r\ndown, the opposite movements being either absolute or relative, various\r\nphenomena would result. This may be illustrated by the accompanying\r\ndiagrams (Figs. 161 and 162), where the profiles of the streams are\r\nrepresented as warped from the positions represented by the dotted\r\nlines, to the positions shown by the full lines. The velocity will be\r\naccelerated below the points of differential elevation (between _a_ and\r\n_b_, Fig. 161, and between _a_ and _b_, and _c_ and _d_, Fig. 162), but\r\nchecked above (above _a_, and between _b_ and _c_, Fig. 162). Above an\r\nelevation which notably checks its flow, a stream is _ponded_. If the\r\nponding is slight, a marsh may develop above the obstruction; if more\r\nconsiderable, a lake is formed. Lakes of this class are likely to be\r\nshort-lived, since the ponded waters are likely to soon overflow and\r\nlower their outlet so as to drain the lake. The elevation which ponds\r\nthe stream may be great enough and rapid enough so that the resulting\r\nlake finds an outlet by some course other than that originally followed\r\nby the stream. Where a stream holds its course across an uplift athwart\r\nits valley, either with or without ponding, it becomes an antecedent\r\nstream (see p. 169), since it has a course assumed before the latest\r\ndeformation of the crust and in apparent disregard of present surface\r\nconfiguration. Thus the Columbia River holds its antecedent course\r\nacross areas which have been uplifted (differentially) hundreds and\r\neven thousands of feet.[65] Some of the striking scenic features of\r\nthis noble valley are the result of these changes in the country\r\nthrough which it flows. A lesser stream would have been diverted, as\r\nmany of its tributaries have been. Even its course across the Cascade\r\nranges is believed to be antecedent.[66]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 163, 164.—Piracy stimulated by warping. Uplift\r\n  along axis 1–2.]\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of valleys and streams resulting from changes of\r\nlevel is illustrated in Fig. 2, Pl. XIV (southern California). The\r\nmain valleys of this part of the coast were developed when the land\r\nstood considerably higher than now. Later the subsidence of the coast\r\nconverted the lower ends of the valleys into bays or fiords. The bays\r\nwere then transformed into lagoons by deposition. Subsequent rise of\r\nthe land or depression of the sea allowed the drainage from the old\r\nlagoons to cut across the deposits which had converted the bays into\r\nlagoons. The result is an old, wide valley above, suggested by a young\r\none below.\r\n\r\nIf the warpings were considerable, much more decisive changes in\r\ndrainage would result. Suppose the drainage of a given region to be\r\nrepresented by the streams in Fig. 163. If there is uplift along the\r\naxis 1–2, that part of _ac_ above the axis of uplift would be ponded,\r\nor at least have its velocity checked, while the flow of some of the\r\ntributaries of _d_ would be accelerated, and might work back and\r\ncapture the other stream (Fig. 164).\r\n\r\nCrustal warping was one of the conditions under which the Tennessee\r\nachieved its present anomalous course, and its history[67] is\r\nillustrative of the complex changes which drainage suffers when warping\r\naffects the area where the rock structures are of unequal resistance.\r\nAt the close of the Cretaceous cycle of erosion, when the Appalachian\r\nMountains had been reduced to a peneplain, the waters falling in\r\nthe area now drained by the upper course of the Tennessee flowed\r\nsouth-south-west to the Gulf in a stream (the Appalachian River, _a_,\r\nFig. 165) the lower part of which had the general position of the Coosa\r\nand the Alabama.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Appalachian River, shorter streams flowed west\r\nand southwest into the Mississippi embayment (Fig. 165) by courses\r\nwhich are not now definitely known. The succeeding cycle of erosion\r\nwas inaugurated by uplift and deformation of the peneplain. The axis\r\nof greatest elevation (_AB_, Fig. 166) was nearly parallel to the\r\nAppalachian River, and the effect of the differential uplift was to\r\nimpose a greater task on this river (_a_, Fig. 166), which flowed\r\nalong the axis of uplift, than upon the rivers which flowed westward\r\nand southwestward to the Mississippi embayment. The result was that\r\nthe strongest of the southwesterly flowing streams worked its head\r\nback into the drainage basin of the Appalachian River, and captured,\r\none by one, the head-waters of its westerly tributaries, establishing\r\nsome such drainage relations as are shown in Fig. 166. Still later,\r\nafter the land area of the region had been considerably extended by\r\nthe withdrawal of the sea, the Appalachian River itself was reached by\r\nthe invading stream, and its waters carried away to the Mississippi Bay\r\nby a course the lower part of which is thought to have corresponded\r\napproximately with the course of the present Black River (_b_, Fig.\r\n167).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 165.—Shows the general position of the main\r\n  drainage lines in the southern Appalachians at the close of the\r\n  Cretaceous cycle of erosion. The lower part of stream _b_ is made to\r\n  follow the course of a portion of the present Tennessee.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 166.—Shows the general position of the main\r\n  drainage lines in the southern Appalachians, after the capture of the\r\n  westerly tributaries of the Appalachian River by stream _b_. Compare\r\n  Fig. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 167.—A stage later than that shown in Fig. 166.\r\n  The sea is represented as having withdrawn from a considerable area\r\n  which was submerged at earlier stages (Figs. 165, 166).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 168.—Shows the final change which resulted in the\r\n  present course of the Tennessee. The land is represented as somewhat\r\n  higher than now.[68]]\r\n\r\nStill later there was further deformation which caused additional\r\nchanges in the drainage. The whole region was uplifted, relatively if\r\nnot absolutely, but the uplift was differential, being greatest along\r\nthe axis represented by _AB_, Fig. 167. The effect of the deformation\r\nwas to stimulate the tributaries of the Ohio flowing north from this\r\naxis. Their growth was further accelerated by the weakness of the\r\nstrata over which they ran. At the same time, the uplift to the south\r\nled the southwesterly flowing stream (_b_, Fig. 167) to discover\r\nrelatively hard beds of rock in its lower course, and these beds\r\nretarded its down-cutting. The result was that a tributary of the Ohio\r\n(_a_, Fig. 167) finally tapped the main stream flowing to the southwest\r\n(_b_, Fig. 167) and carried its upper part over to the Ohio (Fig. 168).\r\nThis was the beginning of the present Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE AGGRADATIONAL WORK OF RUNNING WATER.\r\n\r\n=Principles involved.=—Since deposition results from the failure\r\nof transportation, the factors which control transportation also\r\ninfluence deposition. Transportation by streams is determined largely\r\nby velocity, and the most important factors influencing velocity are\r\nslope, volume, and load (p. 115). Of these the first two are usually of\r\ngreater importance than the third.\r\n\r\nA stream is said to be loaded when it has all the sediment it can\r\ncarry; it is loaded with fine material when it has all the fine\r\nmaterial it can carry, and with coarse material when it has all the\r\ncoarse it can transport. A stream loaded with coarse material flows\r\nmore swiftly than one loaded with fine, for a larger percentage of a\r\nstream’s energy can be utilized in carrying fine material than coarse,\r\nand hence a larger percentage of the energy of a stream which carries a\r\nload of the latter will express itself in velocity.\r\n\r\nDeposition takes place whenever a stream finds itself with more load\r\nthan it can carry, and is an expression of the stream’s refusal to\r\nremain overloaded. A stream may become overloaded in various ways.\r\nIt might at first seem unnecessary to inquire whether a stream may\r\nbe overloaded at its source, but the question is not necessarily to\r\nbe answered in the negative. The source of a stream is not always a\r\ndefinite point. In a general way it may be said that the source of the\r\nnormal stream is at that point in its valley where the bottom is as low\r\nas the ground-water level of the region. But since the ground-water\r\nlevel is not constant (p. 71) the source of a stream is likely to be\r\nfarther up its valley in a wet season than in a dry one (p. 72). After\r\na heavy shower, the run-off descends to the axis of the valley from the\r\nslopes on all sides, and temporarily the stream begins above the point\r\nwhich marks even its wet-season source. If under such circumstances\r\nthe slopes about the head of the valley are notably steeper than the\r\nslope of the valley itself, as they frequently are, the water flowing\r\ndown them may gather an amount of material which it cannot carry after\r\nit reaches the bottom of the valley. This may be the case at, or even\r\nabove, the point which marks the source of the permanent stream. It is,\r\ntherefore, possible for a stream to be overloaded at its source, if we\r\ntake the source to be the point whence the water permanently flows.\r\nDeposition may, therefore, be taking place in a valley at the head of\r\nits permanent stream, or temporarily even in the valley above it.\r\n\r\nStreams issuing from glaciers sometimes have more load than they can\r\ncarry after they escape from the ice. If the stream be regarded as\r\nbeginning at the point where it issues from beneath the ice it may be\r\noverloaded at its source.[69]\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances, a stream may overload itself. Thus if a\r\nstream loaded with coarse detritus reaches a portion of its valley\r\nwhere fine material is accessible in abundance, some of the velocity\r\nwhich is helping to carry the coarse may be used in picking up and\r\ncarrying the fine. This reduces the velocity, and since the stream\r\nalready had all the coarse material it could carry, reduction of\r\nvelocity must result in deposition. It follows that when a stream fully\r\nloaded with coarse material picks up fine, it becomes overloaded, _so\r\nfar as the coarse material is concerned_.\r\n\r\nAgain, tributaries may overload their mains. While tributaries\r\nare usually smaller than their mains, they frequently have higher\r\ngradients, and the smaller stream of higher gradient may bring to the\r\nlarger stream of lower gradient more material than the latter can\r\ncarry away. Thus deposition may take place at the point of junction of\r\ntributaries with their mains. This may go so far as to pond the latter\r\nenough to cause its expansion into a river-lake. Lake Pepin, in the\r\nMississippi River at the mouth of the Chippewa (in Wis.), is an example.\r\n\r\nStreams may become overloaded by losing velocity or volume, or both.\r\nDecrease in velocity is brought about either by decrease in declivity\r\nor in volume. In general, streams have lower gradients and greater\r\nvolumes in their lower courses than in their upper, and these two\r\nelements affect velocity in different ways. If the increase in volume\r\nbe not enough to counterbalance the decrease in declivity, as is often\r\nthe case, a stream which is loaded in its upper course will deposit\r\nin its lower. The decrease of velocity at the debouchure of a stream\r\nalmost always leads to deposition.\r\n\r\nDecrease in velocity as the result of decrease in volume is less\r\ncommon. When decrease in volume occurs, it may be the result of (1)\r\nevaporation, (2) the absorption of water into the bed of the stream,\r\nor (3) branching—the giving off of _distributaries_. While evaporation\r\nis going on everywhere, the diminution of a stream by this means is\r\nusually more than balanced by the increase from tributaries, rainfall,\r\nand springs; but in arid regions a very different condition of things\r\nsometimes exists. If mountains in an arid region be capped with\r\nsnow, its melting supplies the streams during the melting season. As\r\nthe streams flow out from the mountains through dry regions, they\r\nreceive little or no increment from rainfall, tributaries, or springs,\r\nand evaporation reduces the volume of water, or even dissipates it\r\naltogether. Absorption of water into the bed of the stream often\r\naccompanies evaporation. Reduction of volume by evaporation and by\r\nabsorption is especially common in arid regions. Wherever loaded\r\nstreams are reduced in volume, whether by evaporation or absorption,\r\ndeposition takes place.\r\n\r\nThe third way by which velocity is decreased as the result of\r\ndecreasing volume is illustrated at the debouchures of many streams.\r\nNear the Gulf, for example, the Mississippi branches repeatedly (see\r\nFig. 190). The same phenomena are often seen where one stream joins\r\nanother (Fig. 169). Individually the distributaries are much smaller\r\nthan the main stream before they separated from it, and because they\r\nare smaller their combined surfaces are greater, and the amount of\r\nenergy consumed in the friction of flow is increased. The velocity of\r\nthe water and its carrying power are, therefore, reduced. Thus the\r\nbranching of streams gives rise to deposition, and where deposition\r\ntakes place the gradient of the stream is reduced, and this occasions\r\nstill further deposition. The sediment which fills up the channel and\r\nchecks the flow finally compels the stream, or some part of it, to\r\ntransgress its banks. Deposition, therefore, favors the development of\r\ndistributaries, and the development of distributaries in turn favors\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 169.—Delta of the Chelan River at its junction\r\nwith the Columbia. Shows the tendency of streams to distribute where\r\nactive deposition is in progress. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements make it clear that a stream may be eroding\r\nin one part of its valley while it is depositing in another, and that\r\nerosion may alternate with deposition in the same place, on account of\r\nfluctuations in volume, and, therefore, in velocity of the stream. It\r\nwill be seen in the sequel that erosion and deposition may be taking\r\nplace at the same time in the same part of the valley. The activities\r\nof a river are so nicely balanced that slight disturbance at one point\r\ncauses disturbance at all points below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _The deposits._\r\n\r\n=Types.=—Turning from the principles which underlie river deposition to\r\nthe deposits themselves, they are found to occur in various situations.\r\nRunning water usually descends from steeper slopes above to gentler\r\nslopes below, and ends at the sea, or in a lake or inland basin.\r\nWherever there is a sudden decrease in its gradient, as at the base of\r\na hill, ridge, or mountain, running water is likely to leave a large\r\npart of its load, building an _alluvial fan_ or _cone_ (Figs. 67, 68,\r\nand Pl. VI). Even where there is no sudden decrease in the gradient\r\nof a stream, there is likely to be a gradual one, and in spite of the\r\nfact that the increased volume of a stream in its lower course tends to\r\novercome the effect of diminished gradient on velocity, deposition is\r\nlikely to take place as the gradient is reduced. Deposits occasioned by\r\nthe gradual reduction of a stream’s velocity often have great extent\r\nin the direction of a stream’s flow. They cover the flood plains of\r\nstreams, making them _alluvial plains_ (Fig. 73). When a stream reaches\r\nthe sea or a lake its current is destroyed and its load dropped, unless\r\ntaken in charge by the waves and currents of the standing water.\r\nSediment accumulated in quantity at the debouchures of streams gives\r\nrise to _deltas_ (Figs. 169, 187). Alluvial cones and fans, alluvial\r\nplains, and deltas, are the principal types of river deposits. Apart\r\nfrom these well-defined types there are _bars_ in the channels of\r\ndepositing streams, and much ill-defined alluvium which does not allow\r\nof ready classification.\r\n\r\n=Alluvial fans and cones.=—The only distinction between the alluvial\r\nfan and the alluvial cone is one of slope, the cones (they are but\r\nhalf-cones at best) being steeper than the fans. Alluvial fans and\r\ncones have their most striking development where temporary torrents,\r\noccasioned by showers or the rapid melting of snow, issue from mountain\r\nravines. Such streams usually carry heavy loads of detritus, the\r\ncoarser part of which is likely to be deposited at the base of the\r\nmountain slope. Cones and fans built by such streams have a periodic\r\nrather than a steady growth.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of its development the material of the alluvial cone\r\nis deposited much as in a talus cone (compare Fig. 170 with Figs. 67\r\nand 68). Its deposition chokes the channel of the stream, and some of\r\nthe water then seeks new courses to right and left of the apex of the\r\ndeposit. This expands the area of deposition to right and left, while\r\nthe water which flows over it lengthens it in the direction of flow.\r\n\r\nThe course and behavior of the water after reaching an alluvial cone is\r\ninstructive. As its velocity is checked, deposition often takes place\r\nin the channel, diminishing its capacity. As the channel is filled up,\r\nthe water tends to overflow on either side. The overflowing water,\r\nbeing shallow, has so little velocity that much of its load is dropped\r\non either margin of the channel, building up levees. The water ever and\r\nanon breaks through the levees, giving rise to distributary streams,\r\neach of which aggrades its channel and builds its own miniature\r\nlevees (Fig. 171). Not rarely this process of channel-filling and\r\nlevee-building goes on until the channels of the little rivulets are\r\nabove the general level of the cone on which they rest. The rivulet\r\nthen runs in a groove on the crest of a little ridge. The channels on\r\nthe surfaces of fans and cones are fewest and deepest at their heads,\r\nand more numerous and shallower below. In some cases the surface-water\r\ndisappears altogether before the outer border of the fan is reached, by\r\nsinking into the débris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 170.—A talus cone. North Greenland Coast. The\r\n  talus cone reaches the sea-level. Drawn from photograph.]\r\n\r\nAlluvial fans and cones have various forms, and often attain\r\nconsiderable dimensions. Their angles of slope depend on the amount\r\nof reduction of velocity which the depositing water suffers, and the\r\namount and kind of load which it carries. The maximum slope of the\r\ncone is the angle at which the loose material involved will lie. The\r\nminimum slope of the fan, on the other hand, approaches horizontality.\r\nIf many alluvial fans develop in proximity to one another, as at the\r\nbase of a mountain range, they may expand laterally until they merge.\r\nA long succession of them may thus give rise to an extensive _alluvial\r\npiedmont plain_, or a _compound alluvial fan_. The lower edge of such a\r\nfan is often somewhat lobate. Such plains exist along the bases of many\r\nmountain ranges (Pl. VI), and may be seen in miniature even along low\r\nridges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 171.—Miniature levees on an alluvial cone. Slope\r\n  of Gray Peak, Colo. (R. T. Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\nA permanent stream, as well as a temporary one, may develop an alluvial\r\nfan at the base of a mountain slope; but since the mountain course of\r\nthe former is likely to be less steep than that of the latter, its\r\nwaters suffer a correspondingly less reduction of velocity at any\r\none point. The fan of the permanent stream is therefore likely to be\r\nrelatively flat, and to stretch far down the valley. Such fans grade\r\ninto valley plains. From the general principles already discussed, it\r\nis clear that well-developed fans go with relatively youthful stages of\r\nerosion, and belong normally to the upper parts of drainage lines.\r\n\r\n=Ill-defined alluvium.=—There is a widespread mantle of alluvial\r\nmaterial deposited by running water which was not organized into\r\ndistinct streams. The water which runs down smooth slopes in sheets\r\nduring showers carries fine earthy matter, as well as some that\r\nis coarser. These materials are largely deposited at the bases of\r\nthe slopes, forming basal accumulations of greater or less extent,\r\ncomparable in origin to alluvial fans. A relatively small amount of the\r\nslope wash is carried far out from the base of the declivities. It is\r\nnot easy to realize the extent to which this process is taking place.\r\nThere is hardly a slope without loose material, and there is hardly an\r\nacre of low land below a slope on which running water has not deposited\r\nsediment washed down from above. When it is remembered that this is\r\nas true of gentle slopes and their surroundings as of steep slopes,\r\nthough perhaps not to the same extent, and that a very large part of\r\nthe earth’s surface is made up of sensible slopes, or of flats at their\r\nbases, some idea of the aggregate effect may be gained.\r\n\r\nThere is another way of looking at the same question. Earthy matter\r\nis being continually transferred from land to sea, and chiefly from\r\nhigh land. Rarely does it start from any point distant from the shore\r\nand move uninterruptedly to it. It is transported a short distance and\r\nlodged, to be again picked up, carried forward another step in its\r\njourney, and lodged again. For a very large part of the earth’s surface\r\nit would be true to say that its mantle rock is material in transit\r\nfrom higher land to the sea.\r\n\r\n=Alluvial plains.=—Most streams, whether heading in mountains or not,\r\nhave gentler gradients in their lower courses than in their upper, and\r\nin spite of increasing volume are usually unable to carry to their\r\ndebouchures all the material gathered above. The excess of load is\r\ndropped chiefly on the flood-plains of the streams and constitutes them\r\n_alluvial plains_.\r\n\r\nThe making of an alluvial plain usually involves both erosion and\r\ndeposition. When a stream has cut its channel to grade, downward\r\nerosion ceases, or more exactly, downward cutting is, on the average,\r\ncounterbalanced by deposition. So long as a stream is cutting downward\r\nrapidly, it carries away whatever débris descends the side slopes.\r\nWhen it approaches grade, the débris which descends the side slopes\r\ntends to accumulate at their bases, and the V-shaped cross-section of\r\nthe valley becomes U-shaped (see Fig. 172). At about the same time the\r\nstream begins to meander, for, having lost something of its former\r\nvelocity, it is more easily turned from side to side. As it begins to\r\nmeander, it widens the bottom of its valley. This is the initial stage\r\nin the development of the valley flat (2 and 3, Fig. 172). In its\r\nmeandering the stream encroaches on the talus accumulations at the\r\nbases of its valley’s slopes. The side-cutting may remove all the loose\r\ndébris and even undercut the bluff as at _a_, Fig. 173. The stream’s\r\nmeanders shift their positions from time to time so that the valley\r\nflat is successively widened at different points. By lateral planation,\r\ntherefore, a stream tends to develop a flat as soon as it reaches\r\ngrade. This is the initial part of erosion in the making of a river\r\nflat, but a flat developed by erosion alone is not an alluvial plain.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the flat developed by a stream exceeds the width of its\r\nchannel, the water (except in times of flood) does not cover it all at\r\nthe same time. On any part which it temporarily abandons, some débris\r\n(alluvium) is likely to be left. This deposit of alluvium constitutes\r\nthe valley flat an alluvial plain (Fig. 174). It will be seen that the\r\nvalley flat is commonly an alluvial plain from the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 172.—Diagram illustrating the transformation of a\r\n  V-shaped valley into a U-shaped valley.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 173.—Diagram to illustrate the widening of a\r\n  valley flat by erosion. Compare 3, Fig. 172.]\r\n\r\nOnce the valley flat and alluvial plain are begun, their further\r\ndevelopment is easily followed. The stream in flood overflows the banks\r\nof its channel. The velocity of the overflowing water is reduced,\r\nand if it has much load a part of it will be dropped and the plain\r\naggraded. Meantime meandering and lateral planation continue. Thus the\r\nflood-plain is widened by erosion, and aggraded by alluviation, the two\r\nprocesses going on simultaneously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 174.—An alluvial plain. The diagram suggests\r\n  the relative importance of lateral planation and alluviation in the\r\n  development of the flat.]\r\n\r\nFlood-plains, chiefly the result of planation, but partly of\r\naggradation, are a normal feature of river valleys, after a certain\r\nstage of development has been reached. This stage is that at which\r\ndownward erosion becomes slight in comparison with lateral erosion. It\r\nfollows that an alluvial plain normally begins its development where\r\nthe valley is first brought to grade, that is, in its lower course.\r\nAs the development of the valley goes on, the head of the flood-plain\r\nadvances up-stream, and at the same time its older parts become wider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 175.—Diagrammatic representation of a flood plain\r\n  developed by alluviation only.]\r\n\r\n=Flood-plains due to alluviation only.=—Exceptionally, an alluvial\r\nplain is developed by deposition only. Thus if a stream becomes\r\noverloaded while its valley is still narrow, as sometimes happens,\r\ndeposition follows, and, as aggradation proceeds, the narrow valley\r\nacquires a progressively wider bottom (Fig. 175). Wide valley plains\r\nare sometimes developed in this way. Flood plains developed wholly by\r\nalluviation are sometimes formed under conditions which are independent\r\nof the stage of a valley’s development. Thus if a stream suddenly\r\nacquires an exceptional supply of detritus in its upper course, the\r\ndevelopment of an alluvial plain begins immediately below the point of\r\noverloading.\r\n\r\nThe overload might be acquired in various ways. (1) If a stream taps\r\nanother (piracy) which carries a large quantity of sediment, carrying\r\noff both water and sediment to a channel with a lower gradient,\r\ndeposition may take place where, under the earlier conditions, there\r\nwas none. (2) Again, when a stream cuts through a barrier near its\r\nhead waters, its velocity, and, therefore, its eroding power, may be\r\nso increased in its upper course that sediment enough is acquired\r\nto occasion deposition below, where none took place before. (3) In\r\nworking back through formations of varying degrees of resistance, a\r\nstream’s head may presently reach a formation or a region which yields\r\nabundant sediment, even though there was no especial barrier below.\r\n(4) If an advancing glacier should reach the head waters of a stream,\r\nits discharge to the stream would greatly increase the load of the\r\nlatter, and, although its volume would be augmented at the same time,\r\ndeposition might result. As a matter of fact, streams carrying glacial\r\ndrainage are usually aggrading streams. In general, anything which\r\ngreatly increases the load of a stream near its head is likely to cause\r\ndeposition, and so the development of a flood plain, at some point\r\nfarther down the valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 176.—Anastomosing of a depositing stream. Yahtse\r\n  River, Alaska. (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nStreams which are actively aggrading their valleys are likely to\r\nanastomose (Figs. 176, 177). This results from the filling of the\r\nchannels until they are too small to accommodate all the water. The\r\nlatter then breaks out of the channel at few or many points. The new\r\nchannels thus established suffer the same fate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 177.—Anastomosing of the Platte River, Dawson\r\n  Co., Neb. (U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Flood-plains due to obstructions.=—Again, any obstacle in a stream’s\r\ncourse is likely to cause deposition above. Thus dams built across\r\nrivers entail the deposition of sediment above. Where a stream flows\r\nover the outcropping edges of strata of different strength, the more\r\nresistant serve, in some sense, as dams. Above them the stream cuts its\r\nbed to a low gradient, and, becoming sluggish, drops more or less of\r\nthe detritus brought down from above. Obstacles of any sort across a\r\nstream’s channel, therefore, favor the development of alluvial plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 178.—The levees of the Mississippi in\r\n  cross-section, 4 miles north of Donaldsonville, La. Vertical scale\r\n  ×50. The horizontal line in the diagram represents sea-level. The\r\n  bottom of the channel at this point is far below sea-level.]\r\n\r\n=Levees.=—As the stream in flood escapes its channel and overspreads\r\nits plain, its immediate banks are the site of active deposition, for\r\nit is here that the velocity of the overflowing water is first notably\r\nchecked. On the banks of the channel, therefore, low alluvial ridges,\r\ncalled _natural levees_, are built up (Fig. 178, and Pl. XV). They may\r\nbe narrow, or hundreds of feet in width, and are often several feet\r\nabove the plains behind them, giving the latter a slope away from the\r\nchannel of the stream. They are sometimes high enough to control the\r\ncourses of tributary streams, as shown by numerous tributaries to the\r\nMississippi below the Ohio. The Yazoo, for example, flows some 200\r\nmiles on the flood-plain of the Mississippi before it joins that river\r\nnear Vicksburg. The levees even become divides, directing drainage away\r\nfrom the streams they guard (Pl. XV). Streams sometimes build levees\r\nfaster than their tributaries aggrade their channels. The latter are\r\nthen ponded, giving rise to lakes. The lakes on the lower courses of\r\nthe tributaries to the Red River of Louisiana are examples.[70] They\r\nare sometimes built up above their natural level and kept in repair by\r\nhuman agency so as to confine the streams in time of flood. This is a\r\nsource of danger unless they be steadily maintained, for the breaking\r\nof such levees often occasions great destruction. A case in point is\r\nthe breaking of the levees of the Mississippi near New Orleans in 1890.\r\nThe water broke through the levees at the Nita and Martinez crevasses\r\n(Fig. 187) and flowed eastward (from the former) with a current of 15\r\nmiles per hour, spreading destruction in its path. The water flowed\r\neastward through Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, and entered Mobile Bay\r\nwith such volume, velocity, and load of mud, as to destroy for a time\r\nthe oyster and fish industries of that locality.[71]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\n  NEAR HAHNVILLE, LOUISIANA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. MISSOURI.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. MISSOURI.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. MISSOURI.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 179.—Flood-plain of the Mississippi River south\r\n  of the mouth of the Ohio. (From charts of the Miss. Riv.\r\n  Commission.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 180.—Diagram illustrating an early stage in the\r\n  development of meanders. The shaded part represents the area over\r\n  which the stream has worked.]\r\n\r\n=Flood-plain meanders. Cut-and-fill.=—A stream with an alluvial plain\r\nis likely to meander widely (Pl. XVI). In general terms this may be\r\nsaid to be the result of low velocity, which allows it to be easily\r\nturned aside. Were the course of such a stream made straight, it would\r\nsoon become crooked again. The manner of change is illustrated by Figs.\r\n180 and 181. If the banks be less resistant at some points than at\r\nothers, as is always the case, the stream will cut in at those points.\r\nIf the configuration of the channel is such as to direct a current\r\nagainst a given point, _a_ (Fig. 180), the result is the same, even\r\nwithout inequality of material. Once a curve in the bank is started,\r\nit is increased by the current which is directed into it. Furthermore,\r\nas the current issues from the curve, it impinges against the opposite\r\nbank and develops a curve at that point. The water issuing from this\r\ncurve develops another, and so on.\r\n\r\nOnce started, the curves or meanders tend to become more and more\r\npronounced (compare Figs. 180 and 181). In the case represented by Fig.\r\n1, Plate XVI (Missouri River near Brunswick, Mo.) the narrow neck of\r\nland between curves is almost cut through. When this is accomplished,\r\nthe stream will abandon its wide curve. A later stage in the process is\r\nshown in Fig. 2, Plate XVI (the Osage River near Schell, Mo.).\r\n\r\nThe straightening of the channel is often accomplished in another way.\r\nEven before the meanders reach the stage represented by Fig. 1, Plate\r\nXVI, the position of the channel becomes unstable. In time of flood,\r\nthe whole flat is covered with flowing water. The greater depth of\r\nwater in the channel tends to give it a velocity greater than that of\r\nthe water on the flat outside. But the distance from _a_ to _c via b_\r\n(Fig. 181) is much greater than that in a direct line. It follows that\r\nthe slope from _a_ to _c_ direct is greater than that by way of _b_. If\r\nthe current between _a_ and _c_ in time of flood be strong enough to\r\nerode, it may deepen its bed, and thereby increase the volume of water\r\nfollowing this course. The increased volume gives increased velocity,\r\nand the result may be the opening of a channel between _a_ and _c_\r\ndirect. The channel may be worn so deep that when the flood subsides,\r\nthe stream will follow it. So long as the abandoned channel-curve\r\nremains unfilled with sediment, it is often called a _cut-off_. If\r\nit contains standing water and has the proper form, it is called an\r\n_ox-bow lake_ (Fig. 182), or sometimes a _bayou_. The water-filled\r\nportions are not always bows (Fig. 183, Osage River, near Butler, Mo.).\r\nCut-offs, with or without standing water, are of common occurrence\r\nalong most rivers with wide plains. Meandering is not confined to\r\nstreams which are near sea-level. Even small creeks at high altitudes\r\nmay meander, if so situated as to have slight velocity. Trout Creek in\r\nthe Yellowstone Park (Fig. 184) is an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 181.—Diagram illustrating later stages in the\r\n  development of meanders.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 182.—Meanders and cut-offs (ox-bow lakes) in\r\n  the Mississippi Valley a little below Vicksburg. The figure also\r\n  shows the migration of meanders down-stream, and their tendency to\r\n  increase themselves. (From charts Nos. 18 and 19, Mississippi River\r\n  Commission.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 183.—Bayou Lakes, Osage River, near Butler, Mo.]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some relation between the width of the belt within\r\nwhich a stream meanders, and the width of the stream itself. Recently\r\nit has been estimated that the ratio between them is 18 : 1.[72]\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the meanders it is to be noted that lateral\r\nplanation on the one side of a stream is accompanied by deposition on\r\nthe other. This is _cut-and-fill_. The sediment eroded from the curve\r\nwhich is concave toward the stream is shifted down-stream, while that\r\ndeposited in the curve which is convex toward the stream is brought\r\ndown from above. Thus even in the development of meanders, the material\r\nwhich is dislodged is shifted down-stream. Since the current directed\r\nagainst the down-stream side of a growing meander is on the average\r\nstronger than that directed against the opposite side, the meander\r\nitself has a tendency to migrate down-stream (Fig. 182).\r\n\r\nIn their evolution, the curves of a stream’s channel often reach and\r\nundermine the valley bluff (Pl. VII). Since the meanders are, on the\r\naverage, shifted down-stream individually, and since meanders are\r\nfrequently developed in new places, it follows that a meandering stream\r\ntends to widen its valley throughout. Widening is also effected in\r\nother ways, for a stream with a flood-plain sometimes abandons its\r\nchannel altogether for miles at a stretch, and the new course chosen\r\nmay be against one of the bluffs of the valley. Such changes are most\r\nlikely to take place where deposition along channel and levees has\r\nbrought the part of the flood-plain (though not necessarily the bottom\r\nof the channel) adjacent to the stream above the level of that farther\r\nfrom it (Fig. 178). The change is likely to be effected in time of\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nFlood-plains often attain great size. That of the Mississippi below the\r\nOhio (Fig. 179) has a width ranging from rather more than 20 miles at\r\nHelena (Ark.), to something like 80 miles in the latitude of Greenville\r\n(Miss.).[73] Below the Ohio its area is something like 30,000 square\r\nmiles, and its entire area has been estimated at about 50,000 square\r\nmiles.[74]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the rotation of the earth should affect the erosion\r\nof streams, increasing it on the one bank (the right in the northern\r\nhemisphere and the left in the southern) and decreasing it on the\r\nother.[75] The streams doubtless accommodate themselves to the rotation\r\nof the earth in the original development of their gradation-plains\r\nand flood-plains, and the later effects of rotation are usually\r\ninconspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 184.—Meanders of Trout Creek, Yellowstone Park.\r\n  (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Scour-and-fill.=—It has already been shown that aggrading streams cut\r\nlaterally at the same time that they build up their plains. It is now\r\nto be added that they periodically deepen their channels to a notable\r\nextent, and that the deepening of the channel takes place at the very\r\ntime when the flood-plain is being aggraded. In other words, the stream\r\nin flood aggrades its plain, and degrades its channel. This follows\r\nfrom the fact that the current is sluggish in the former position,\r\nwhere the water is shallow, and rapid in the latter, where it is deep.\r\nWhen the flood subsides, the channel, deepened while the current was\r\ntorrential, is filled again by the feebler current which follows. This\r\nalternate deepening and filling is known as scour-and-fill. It is well\r\nillustrated by the Missouri River. At Nebraska City, scour is believed\r\nto occasionally reach depths of 70 to 90 feet.[76] At Blair, about 25\r\nmiles above Omaha, the same river is believed to cut to bed-rock (about\r\n40 feet below the bottom of the channel in low water) twice a year,\r\nthat is, during floods.[77] Fig. 185 shows the changes recorded in the\r\nchannel of the river at this point during the year 1883. It shows that\r\nthe scour-and-fill during this year amounted to almost 40 feet. All\r\nstreams similarly situated do a like work. The material thus eroded\r\nis shifted down-stream, some of it for short distances only, and some\r\nof it to the sea. Even an aggrading stream therefore is not without\r\nerosive activity; it is a stream whose fill exceeds its scour, not one\r\nwhich has ceased to erode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 185.—Diagram illustrating scour and fill in the\r\n  Missouri River. A record of soundings at Blair Bridge (near Omaha),\r\n  1883. Shows also the cross-sections of the river at various rates.\r\n  (Todd, Bull. 158, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Materials of the flood-plain.=—As a result of its varying velocities\r\nin flood and low water, a stream may deposit coarse material at one\r\ntime and fine at another. A similar sequence of deposits takes place\r\nin the flood-plain of a meandering stream, irrespective of floods.\r\nFlood-plain deposits are often therefore very heterogeneous, as shown\r\nin Fig. 186, which represents the constitution of the alluvium of the\r\nMissouri River at Omaha. The deposits of the streams range from the\r\nfinest clay, through sand to gravel, and even bowlders. In general they\r\nbecome finer down-stream. In a given plain, they are usually coarser\r\nbelow and finer above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 186.—Diagram to show the heterogeneous character\r\n  of alluvial deposits. (Todd, Bull. 158, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Topography of the flood-plain.=—The flood-plain is nearly, but not\r\naltogether, flat. It has a gentle slope down-stream, and often for a\r\ndistance from the sides toward the center (Fig. 174). This latter slope\r\nis the result of deposition by waters descending to the plain from the\r\nsides. It is destroyed wherever a meandering stream reaches its bluffs.\r\nWhen levees are well developed, there is a slope from them toward the\r\nsides of the valley (Fig. 178), but it rarely continues to the limiting\r\nbluffs. Since a stream with a well-developed flat frequently shifts\r\nits course, old levees and abandoned channels lend variety to the\r\ntopography of the flood-plain.\r\n\r\n=The topographic adjustment of tributaries.=[78]—The meandering and\r\nshifting of a main stream affects its tributaries. If a main stream\r\nswings against the bluff through which a tributary enters, the latter\r\nbrings its channel into topographic adjustment by lowering its end to\r\nthe level of the main. If now the main stream opposite the tributary\r\nswings to the other side of its valley, the tributary must make its\r\nway across the flat with a very low gradient. Not only this, but the\r\nflat of the main valley through which the tributary must flow is likely\r\nto be aggraded by the main in time of flood. The result is that the\r\ntributary stream becomes an aggrading stream at its debouchure, and\r\ntopographic adjustment is not established until it has filled up the\r\nlower end of its valley to some notable extent. The filling of the\r\nlower end of the tributary likewise affects the lower ends of its lower\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 187.—A general view of the Mississippi delta.]\r\n\r\nIf the main stream again swings over to the point where the tributary\r\nissues from its valley, the tributary stream and all its affected\r\ntributaries again become eroding streams. Thus scour-and-fill are not\r\nconfined to the valley of the main stream.\r\n\r\n=River-lakes.=—While rivers are in general hostile to lakes, they\r\nsometimes give origin to them. Oxbow lakes (Fig. 182 and Pl. XVI),\r\ndue to the cut-offs of meandering streams, have already been referred\r\nto. Lakes formed in the same way have other forms (Pl. XVI and Fig.\r\n183). Rivers also give rise to lakes through the deposits they make.\r\nIf a main stream obstructs its tributaries by deposition at their\r\ndebouchures, their lower courses are ponded and converted into lakes.\r\nThe lakes along the tributaries to the Red River of Louisiana have\r\nalready been cited as examples. If a tributary brings more load to its\r\nmain than the latter can carry away, the detritus constitutes a partial\r\ndam, ponding the river and causing it to expand into a lake above. Such\r\nis the origin of Lake Pepin already referred to. In mountain regions,\r\nthe alluvial cones of tributary valleys sometimes pond their mains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 188.—Longitudinal section of an incipient delta\r\n  made of coarse material.]\r\n\r\nRivers may be dammed in other ways, as by lava flows, by landslides, by\r\nglacial drift, etc. In all such cases, lakes may come into existence,\r\nbut they are not due primarily to the activity of the river itself.\r\n\r\n=Deltas.=[79]—Where a stream enters standing water, or a slower stream,\r\na special form of plain, _the delta_, is sometimes built up (Figs. 169,\r\n187, and 188). Deltas and alluvial fans have much in common, and their\r\nonly notable differences are those imposed by the differences in the\r\nconditions of deposition. The current of the stream is checked, but not\r\naltogether stopped, at its immediate debouchure. If it carries abundant\r\nsediment, much of it will be promptly dropped where the decrease in\r\nvelocity is first felt. Such flow as there is beyond the debouchure is\r\nnot confined to a definite channel, and the deposits made are therefore\r\nspread more or less on either side of the line which represents the\r\ncontinuation of the stream’s course.\r\n\r\nAs the depth of the water into which the stream flows increases, the\r\ncurrent diminishes. Out to the point where the depth of the standing\r\nwater is less than the depth of the current, the latter affects the\r\nbottom, and the surface of the deposits made slopes gently seaward; but\r\nwhere the depth of the standing water is such that the projected stream\r\ncurrent is ineffective at the bottom, all the load rolled along the\r\nbottom is dropped, and a depositional slope is established (Fig. 188),\r\nits upper edge being below sea-level by an amount corresponding roughly\r\nto the depth of the current which brings the detritus. The outer slope\r\nis relatively steep and well-defined where the detritus is coarse, and\r\nrelatively gentle and ill-defined where it is fine. Thus the stream\r\ntends to construct a sort of platform in the water just beyond its\r\ndebouchure. The successive deposits on the outer abrupt slope will dip\r\nconformably with its surface (Fig. 189). The finest sediment will be\r\ncarried beyond the steep slope, and conform to the topography of the\r\nbottom beyond (_c_, Fig. 189).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the top of the delta platform is at the level of the\r\nbottom of the stream’s channel at the point of debouchure, but it is\r\ngradually aggraded as water continues to flow over it. Its landward\r\nmargin is presently built up to sea-level and then above it, and as the\r\ndelta grows the delta-land is extended seaward (compare Figs. 188 and\r\n189). At the same time the channel of the stream above the original\r\nhead of the delta is aggraded, for the current there is checked by the\r\naggradation of the delta. Thus alluvial deposits continuous with the\r\ndelta are extended landward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 189.—Longitudinal section of the delta at a later\r\n  stage of development.]\r\n\r\nThe projection of the direction of the lower end of the stream may be\r\nsaid to be the axis of the extra-debouchure current. From this axis,\r\nwhere the flow is strongest, the movement diverges more or less to\r\nright and left. Since the velocity of the diverging water is reduced\r\nmore rapidly than that of the water which follows the axis of flow,\r\ndeposition is likely to take place faster on either side of the axis\r\nthan along the axis itself. The result is that the extra-debouchure\r\ncurrent tends to build up levee-like ridges on either side, making a\r\nsort of sluice-way for itself. This sluice-way is gradually extended\r\nseaward, and at the same time gradually filled. As its capacity is\r\nreduced, more and more of the water flows over its sides. Presently\r\nthe escape of the water over the little side-levees will develop a\r\nbreak at some point, and a line of distinct flow then diverges from the\r\nmain current. This distributary repeats the history of its main. Thus\r\nthe processes of levee-building, channel-filling, and levee-breaking\r\nfollow one another, until some such system of currents as shown in\r\nFig. 190 is developed. The result is that a delta’s growth is not\r\nsimply in the line of extension of the main stream, but in a more or\r\nless semicircular area, the center of the circle being a point slightly\r\nbelow the position of the debouchure of the stream when the delta\r\nbegan. At any stage in its development the margin of the delta is more\r\nor less crenate (Fig. 191), or characterized by delta fingers (Fig.\r\n190), the projections corresponding to the positions of the debouchures\r\nof the latest streams flowing across it. The extreme ends of the\r\ndelta lobes (Fig. 190), and of groups of the delta fingers, often\r\nhave something of the shape of the Greek letter from which the name\r\noriginated, but the resemblance in form between a well-developed delta\r\nand the Greek letter is not striking. Deltas are sometimes built in\r\nbays, and in such cases their forms are predetermined on all sides but\r\none. The head of a delta is sometimes arbitrarily located at the point\r\nwhere the first distributaries are given off. Since this point shifts\r\nwidely with time, the definition can hardly be accepted. On this basis\r\nthe head of the Mississippi delta is about 200 miles above its lower\r\nend. In reality it is much farther north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 190.—The terminus of the delta of the\r\n  Mississippi. (C. and G. Survey.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 191.—A miniature delta.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of a delta, shown in Fig. 189, shows its history. At any\r\nstage in its growth the river discharges its sediment across that part\r\nof the platform already built. The sediment rolled at the bottom of\r\nthe current is dumped on reaching the steep slope, and constitutes\r\nthe inclined _fore-set_ beds shown in Fig. 189. The material in\r\nsuspension is carried farther, settles more gradually, and constitutes\r\nthe _bottom-set_ beds (_c_, Fig. 189). In time the bottom-set beds,\r\noriginally deposited some distance beyond the debouchure, may come to\r\nbe overlain by the fore-set beds, deposited at a later time. While the\r\nfore-set beds are being deposited on the steep slopes of the delta, and\r\nthe bottom-set beds beyond, deposition is also taking place on the top\r\nof the delta. These _top-set_ beds are laid down in a nearly horizontal\r\nposition, and their seaward margin is gradually extended. Thus the\r\ndelta comes to have the threefold structure shown in Fig. 189.\r\n\r\nThat part of the delta which is above the abrupt slope of its front\r\ncorresponds in all essentials to an alluvial fan; but the delta as a\r\nwhole differs from the fan in its abrupt and crenate or digitate margin.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the delta is not wholly the product of a\r\nstream’s activity. The stream supplies the material, but the lake\r\nor sea renders at least passive assistance in its disposition. Not\r\nall rivers opening into the sea build deltas, and their failure is\r\noften the result of waves or shore currents which carry off the river\r\nsediment. Deltas are, however, sometimes formed in tidal seas, as at\r\nthe debouchures of the Yukon; the Mackenzie, where the tidal range is\r\nthree feet; the Niger, where the range is four feet; the Hoang-Ho,\r\nwhere the range is eight feet; and the Brahmaputra and Ganges, where\r\nthe range is sixteen feet.[80] Since lakes, bays, gulfs, and inland\r\nseas have weaker waves and currents than the open sea, they are more\r\nfavorable than the latter for the growth of deltas. Hence occur such\r\ndeltas as those of the Mississippi, the Nile, the Po, and the Danube.\r\n\r\nDeltas are likely to be absent, or confined to the heads of bays, on\r\ncoasts which have recently sunk. Their general absence on the Atlantic\r\ncoast of the United States is a case in point.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give some idea of the extent of deltas, and of\r\ntheir importance in land building. The Mississippi delta is advancing\r\ninto the Gulf at the rate of about 100 yards per year, or a mile in\r\n16 or 17 years. Its length is more than 200 miles, its area more than\r\n12,000 square miles, and its depth at New Orleans has been estimated\r\nat 700[81] to 1000[82] feet. This great depth is believed to be the\r\nresult of subsidence, and so of the superposition of one delta on\r\nanother.[83] The delta of the Yukon has a sea margin of 70 miles, and\r\nextends more than 100 miles inland. The delta of the Rhône has also\r\nhad a remarkable growth, considering the size and the history of the\r\nstream. Arles, near the debouchure of the stream, was 14 to 16 miles\r\ninland in the fourth century +B.C.+, and is now 30 miles inland.[84]\r\nThe Rhône has also built a great delta in Lake Geneva, and its lower\r\ndelta is built of sediment gathered below the lake. The Po has built\r\na delta 14 miles beyond Adria, the port which gave its name to the\r\nAdriatic Sea. The extension of this delta has been at the average rate\r\nof about 50 feet per year, but recently, on account of artificial\r\nembankments, the rate has been much more rapid.[85] The Ganges and\r\nBrahmaputra together have made a delta of great size. Its area is\r\nsometimes estimated to be as high as 50,000 or 60,000 square miles,\r\nand its head is more than 200 miles from the sea.[86] The head of the\r\nNile delta is 90 miles from the sea, and it has a coastal border of\r\n180 miles. The head of the delta of the Hoang-Ho is about 300 miles\r\nfrom the coast, and its seaward border has a length of about 400 miles,\r\nthough with some highland interruptions.[87]\r\n\r\nAfter a delta has been built into a lake, the lake may disappear,\r\nleaving the delta out of water. Such “fossil” deltas, if so recently\r\nexposed that erosion has not destroyed their distinctive features,\r\nare readily recognized by their flat tops, their abrupt and lobate\r\nfronts, and their characteristic structure. They are often a means\r\nof determining the former existence of extinct lakes,[88] or the\r\nformer higher levels of lakes which still exist.[89] Elevated deltas\r\non seashores show either a rise of the land or a depression of the\r\nsea-level.\r\n\r\nThe material which is carried along the coasts or shores from the\r\nmouths of rivers may take on various and peculiar forms, according\r\nto the strength, direction, and relations of waves and currents. The\r\nconsideration of these forms belongs more properly to the work of the\r\nsea than to that of rivers, since rivers are not concerned in their\r\nconstruction except in supplying material.\r\n\r\n=Delta lakes.=—Delta-building streams sometimes help to form lakes by\r\nthrowing their deposits around an area which fails to be aggraded to\r\nsea-level. Lake Pontchartrain, and other lakes in the delta of the\r\nMississippi are examples (Fig. 187).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 192.—Terraces of the Frazier River at Lillooet,\r\n  B. C. (Calvin.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STREAM TERRACES.\r\n\r\nStream terraces[90] are bench-like flats or narrow plains along the\r\nsides of valleys (Fig. 192). They are usually narrow, but sometimes\r\nhave great length in the direction of the axis of the valley. They\r\noriginate in various ways.\r\n\r\n=Due to inequalities of hardness.=—Reference has already been made\r\n(p. 140) to the effect of hard horizontal layers in the development\r\nof terraces and terraciform projections on the sides of valleys (Fig.\r\n120). Such terraces are the result of differential degradation, and\r\nthe upper surface of the hard layer marks the lower limit of the\r\nterrace, which commonly has a distinct slope toward the stream. Except\r\nwhere interrupted by tributary valleys, such terraces are likely to\r\nbe continuous in a valley so long as the structure remains the same\r\nand the stream sustains the same relation to it. Such terraces would\r\nfirst show themselves in the older part of the valley. The effect of\r\ninclination of the hard stratum on the development of such terraces\r\nwill be readily inferred. Terraces and benches of this sort are not\r\nequally distinct at all stages of a valley’s history. For great\r\ndistinctness, the hard layer should have been exposed long enough to\r\nallow the general processes of erosion to have effected considerable\r\ndifferential wear, but not long enough to allow the topographic effects\r\nof unequal resistance to be obliterated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 193.—Diagram illustrating a distinct terrace and\r\n  a “second bottom (_b_),” which may be regarded as a low terrace.]\r\n\r\n=Normal flood-plain terraces.=—It has been seen that deposition in\r\na river valley stands in more or less definite relationship to the\r\nstage of its development, and that the deposition which leads to\r\nthe development of an alluvial plain is likely to take place where\r\nthe higher gradient of the upper course gives place to the gentler\r\ngradient of the lower. It has also been seen that as a stream’s history\r\nadvances, the stretch where the gradient is high recedes up-stream,\r\nand that the point which marks the head of active deposition follows.\r\nIt follows that a river flat or flood-plain normally begins in the\r\nlower part of a valley, and works progressively headward, its upper end\r\nfollowing, at some considerable distance, the head of the valley itself.\r\n\r\nThe commoner river terraces are remnants of former flood-plains,\r\nbelow which the streams which made them have cut their channels. It\r\nhas already been pointed out (p. 184) that processes of erosion and\r\ndeposition work together in the development of flood-plains, and that\r\nsome flood-plains have but little alluvium (Fig. 174), while others\r\nowe their origin wholly to stream deposits (Fig. 175). It follows that\r\nterraces developed from flood-plains may be of rock, of alluvium, or of\r\nrock covered with alluvium.\r\n\r\nThe amount which a river channel must be deepened in order to change\r\nthe remnants of its flood-plain to terraces cannot be definitely\r\nstated. When a channel is so deep that the remnants of a former\r\nflood-plain are no longer flooded, they would be called terraces,\r\nespecially if a lower flood-plain has been developed. Even though not\r\nabove the reach of floods, they are often called terraces if they are\r\nnotably above the channel and separated from it by a lower plain. Thus\r\nthe flat at _b_, Fig. 193, would be called a terrace, even though\r\ncovered by water in exceptional floods; but the flat at _c_, but\r\nslightly above the channel, would hardly be called a terrace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 194.—Diagram illustrating the beginning of the\r\n  development of a terrace from a flood-plain.]\r\n\r\nThe question now arises why a stream, having once developed a\r\nflood-plain, should sink its channel to a lower level, leaving parts\r\nof the old flood-plain as terraces. This may be brought about by the\r\noperation of various causes.\r\n\r\n(1) In the first place, the head of the valley-plain where the first\r\nnotable deposition takes place normally advances up-stream. After the\r\nadvance has been considerable, the descending stream may, on reaching\r\nthe head of its valley-plain, lose so much of its load as to be able\r\nto sink its channel into the flood-plain farther down the valley (Fig.\r\n194).\r\n\r\n(2) Ordinarily a stream does not drop all its load at the head of its\r\nplain, but only its excess; but it will always drop coarse sediment\r\nto take fine, if fine be available. For a relatively small amount of\r\ncoarse material dropped, a relatively large amount of fine may be\r\ntaken up (p. 179). Other things being equal, it follows that when a\r\nstream drops coarse material to take fine, its channel is degraded\r\nunless there is at the same time a great reduction in the stream’s\r\nenergy. Such reduction is likely to go with the decreasing declivity\r\ndown-stream; but this is partly, or sometimes wholly, counterbalanced\r\nby the increasing volume of water. By the exchange of load, therefore,\r\na stream may ultimately sink its channel below the flood-plain which\r\nthe earlier and perhaps smaller stream had developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 195.—Diagram to illustrate the development of\r\n  river terraces by the widening of a channel or meander belt. The\r\n  valley flat above might not be called a terrace; but the same plain\r\n  below, where the meander belt has some width, would be called a\r\n  terrace.]\r\n\r\n(3) Again, so long as a stream is actively eroding at its head, there\r\nis likely to be some aggradation below. At a later stage in the\r\nstream’s history, when active erosion at the head has ceased because\r\nof the reduction of the surface, less material will be carried from\r\nthe upper part of the valley, and the stream on the flood-plain below,\r\nformerly loaded with material from up the valley, is now free to take\r\nup and carry away material temporarily left on the flood-plain. The\r\nresult is a deepening of the channel.\r\n\r\n(4) Any stream which has reached the flood-plain stage is likely to\r\nmeander. After the flood-plain has become wide, the width of the belt\r\nwithin which the stream meanders is less than the width of its plain.\r\nIn the Lower Mississippi, for example, the meander belt is often no\r\nmore than a third to a tenth of the width of the flood-plain. It has\r\nalready been pointed out that the meanders migrate down the valley. In\r\nso doing they depress the meander belt, the tendency being to reduce\r\nit to the level of the channel, and, therefore, below the level of\r\nthe flood-plain. As the meander belt widens, the depression which it\r\ndevelops becomes more and more capacious. Presently it may attain such\r\ndimensions as to hold the water of ordinary floods. At this stage,\r\nor even before, such parts of the earlier flood-plain as remain, are\r\nterraces.\r\n\r\nThese several tendencies conspire to partially destroy river\r\nflood-plains, and to transform such parts as remain into terraces _in\r\nthe normal course of a river’s history_. They appear first in the\r\nlower part of the valley, and migrate headward, following the course\r\nof nearly every other phase of activity in a stream’s history. The\r\nheads of the terraces follow, at a respectful distance, the head of the\r\nflood-plain, just as the head of the flood-plain follows at a distance\r\nthe head of the valley. The second and subsequent flood-plains and the\r\nterraces to which they give origin follow the same course.\r\n\r\nTerraces developed by the normal activities of a stream are always low,\r\nand it is improbable that they would ordinarily be conspicuous. The\r\nvertical distance between the first (highest) and second is greater\r\nthan that between the second and third. The principles developed on\r\npage 65 et seq., in connection with the erosion of the hypothetical\r\nisland, are applicable here.\r\n\r\n=Flood-plain terraces due to other causes.=—Certain other causes,\r\naccidental rather than normal to a stream, result in the development of\r\nterraces from flood-plains. (1) If there be uplift in a region where\r\nthe rivers have flats, the streams are rejuvenated, and the remnants\r\nof their former flood-plains become terraces. (2) If an alluvial\r\nflood-plain has been built as the result of an excessive supply of\r\nsediment (p. 186), the exhaustion or withdrawal of the excessive supply\r\nwould leave the stream again relatively clear, and free to erode where\r\nit had been depositing. It would forthwith set to work to carry away\r\nthe material which it had temporarily unloaded on the plain. The plains\r\nbuilt up in many valleys in the northern part of our continent during\r\nthe glacial period, when the drainage from the ice coursed through\r\nthem, have subsequently been partially destroyed by erosion, and their\r\nremnants have become terraces. A notable reduction in the amount of\r\navailable sediment, even when the earlier supply was not excessive,\r\nproduces a similar result. (3) A notable increase in the volume of a\r\nstream, without corresponding increase in load, as when one stream\r\ncaptures another, may occasion the development of terraces by allowing\r\nthe stream to deepen its channel. (4) Above any barrier which dams a\r\nstream, a flood-plain is likely to be developed. When the barrier is\r\nremoved the stream will cut more or less deeply into the plain above,\r\nleaving terraces. (5) The recession of a falls through a flood-plain\r\nconverts such parts of it as remain, into terraces.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that many river terraces, mostly\r\nvery low, are normal features of valley development, coming into\r\nexistence at definite stages in a valley’s history. They are generally\r\ncomposed, in large part, of river alluvium. Others result from more\r\nor less accidental causes, working singly or in conjunction, and to\r\nthis class belong all of the more conspicuous terraces developed from\r\nflood-plains. The structure of a terrace often affords some clue to its\r\norigin (Fig. 196).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 196.—Terraces partly of rock and partly of\r\n  alluvium. Such terraces indicate successive uplifts, or some other\r\n  change which had a similar effect on the stream which made the\r\n  valley.]\r\n\r\n=Discontinuity of terraces.=—When a stream sinks its channel into\r\nits flood-plain, it does not follow that a terrace remains on each\r\nside. Where the stream’s deepened channel is in the middle of its\r\nflood-plain, there is, temporarily, a terrace on either side; but\r\nwherever the deepened channel is at one margin of its flood-plain,\r\na terrace remains on the other side only. Even where continuous at\r\nthe outset, terraces soon become discontinuous, for all processes of\r\nsubaërial erosion conspire to destroy them. A stream is likely to\r\nmeander on its second and later flood-plains, as on its first and\r\nhighest one. Wherever the meanders on its second flood-plain reach the\r\nborders of the first flood-plain, the terrace at that point disappears,\r\nand since the meanders are continually migrating, terraces are\r\ncontinually disappearing. The same would be true of the second terrace,\r\nif a second were developed. The removal of portions of a terrace by\r\nthe sweep of meanders is likely to leave the remnants cuspate toward\r\nthe stream.[91] Again, tributary streams, in bringing their channels\r\ninto topographic adjustment with their mains, cut through the terraces\r\nof the latter. New gullies develop on the faces of the terraces and\r\ntheir heads work back across them, dissecting them still further. At\r\nthe same time, sheet erosion and other phases of slope wash tend to\r\ndrive the scarps of the terraces back toward the bluff beyond. By the\r\ntime a second series of terraces is well developed, no more than meagre\r\nremnants of the first may remain.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing considerations it is clear that the extent to which\r\nriver terraces once developed, now remain, is dependent in part on the\r\nlength of time which has elapsed since the river sank its channel below\r\nthem. Other things being equal, the greater their age the more meagre\r\ntheir remnants.\r\n\r\nTerraces developed from river plains formed chiefly by alluviation\r\nstand a better chance of long life than most other alluvial terraces.\r\nThis is because of the configuration of the original valley, the\r\naggradation of which gave origin to the plain. The principle involved\r\nis illustrated by Fig. 197. In developing the second flood-plain the\r\nriver encounters the rock wall of the valley. This greatly retards\r\nlateral erosion, and the terrace above, _defended_[92] by the rock, is\r\nlikely to be long-lived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 197.—Diagram to show why certain terraces are\r\n  longer lived than others.]\r\n\r\nAlluvial terraces, like rock shelves, are popularly thought to mark\r\n“old levels of the river.” In one sense this is true, but not in the\r\nsense in which the expression is commonly used. Every level, from the\r\ncrest of the bounding bluffs to the bottom of a valley, is a level at\r\nwhich water ran for a longer or shorter time; but the terrace does not\r\nmean that the river was once so much larger than now as to fill the\r\nvalley from its present channel to the level of the terraces.\r\n\r\n=Termini of terraces.=—From the mode of development of terraces it will\r\nbe seen that, traced up-stream, each terrace should theoretically grade\r\ninto a flood-plain at its upper end (Fig. 194), and that the upper end\r\nof the second (from the top) terrace, where there are two, would not\r\nbe so far up-stream as the upper end of the first (highest). This is\r\nrepresented diagrammatically in Fig. 198.\r\n\r\nThe down-stream termini of terraces are rarely distinct. This is partly\r\nbecause the notable meandering of the streams in their lower courses\r\nis antagonistic to the preservation of terraces. If all terraces\r\nonce developed remained, and if delta-building proceeded without\r\ninterruption from waves, the relations should be somewhat as follows:\r\nTraced down-stream, the cliff between the oldest (highest) terrace and\r\nthe next younger becomes gradually lower until it finally disappears,\r\nand the continuation of the two is found in a common plain. The cliff\r\nbetween the second and third terraces should disappear in the same way,\r\nand below its disappearance the plain representing their continuation\r\nis continuous with that representing the continuation of the first and\r\nsecond. The cliff between the second and third terraces may or may not\r\ncontinue farther down-stream than that between the first and second.\r\nThe plains below the terraces finally become continuous with the lowest\r\nflood-plain and with the delta. These relations can rarely be seen\r\nbecause of the destruction of the older terraces, and because of the\r\nerosion by waves along shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 198.—Diagram looking up the valley, showing two\r\n  terraces below, one in the middle, and none above. The relations are\r\n  purely diagrammatic.]\r\n\r\nThe topography of terraces is similar to that of flood-plains, except\r\nin so far as modified by erosion. While flat in general, the terrace\r\nmay slope either toward or from the valley bluff, and its surface\r\nmay be marked by all the minor irregularities which characterize a\r\nflood-plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n               THE WORK OF GROUND- (UNDERGROUND) WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany familiar facts demonstrate the general presence of abundant water\r\nbeneath the surface of the land. The thousands of wells in regions\r\npeopled by civilized races, and the countless springs which issue from\r\nthe sides of mountains and valleys are a sufficient proof both of the\r\nwide distribution of ground-water and of its great abundance.\r\n\r\nCertain well-known facts make it clear that ground-water is intimately\r\nconnected with rainfall. In a dry season the level of the water in\r\nwells commonly sinks, and after a heavy rain it rises (p. 71); and\r\nthe amount of sinking is greater when the drought is long, and the\r\nrise is most notable when the rainfall is heavy. Many springs which\r\ndischarge large quantities of water during a wet season flow with\r\nreduced volume, or cease to flow altogether in periods of drought.\r\nFurthermore, the water of springs and wells has the properties which\r\nrain-water would possess after sinking beneath the surface and\r\ndissolving mineral substances. Rain-water is seen to sink beneath the\r\nsurface with every shower, and since this source seems altogether\r\nadequate for ground-water, and since no other source is known whence\r\nany considerable amount of ground-water might come, it is concluded\r\nthat atmospheric precipitation is its chief source.\r\n\r\nWater gets beneath the surface by processes which are readily seen.\r\nWherever the soil is porous some of the rain which falls upon it is\r\nabsorbed. Sinking through the soil to the solid rock it finds cracks\r\nand pores through which it descends to great depths. Nowhere are the\r\nrocks beneath the mantle rock so compact and so free from cracks, when\r\nany considerable area is considered, as to prevent the percolation of\r\nwater through them.\r\n\r\n=Conditions influencing descent of rain-water.=—There are several\r\nconditions which influence not only the amount of water which sinks\r\nbeneath the surface in a given area, but the proportion of the\r\nprecipitation which follows this course. These are as follows: (1)\r\n_Amount of precipitation._—In a general way it is true that the\r\ngreater the amount of precipitation the greater the amount of water\r\nwhich will sink beneath the surface. Other things being equal, a region\r\nof heavy precipitation is a region where wells are easily obtained\r\nand springs common. (2) _Rate of precipitation._—A given amount of\r\nprecipitation may be concentrated in a short interval, or distributed\r\nthrough a considerable period of time. In the latter case more of the\r\nwater sinks beneath the surface; in the former, a larger proportion\r\nruns off over the surface. The reason is readily seen. Water passes\r\nthrough small spaces, such as those of soil, slowly, and its rate of\r\npassage decreases rapidly with decreasing size of the passageways.\r\nWhen rain falls rapidly on a surface of even moderately close texture,\r\nthe uppermost layer of soil is promptly filled with water, and since\r\nthe water passes downward slowly, the uppermost saturated part of the\r\nsoil becomes virtually impervious. While in this condition, the water\r\nwhich falls on it will run off if there be slope, and stand if there be\r\nnone. In the latter case it will sink slowly as the water in the soil\r\npasses down to lower levels. If precipitation takes place no faster\r\nthan the water can sink through the soil, all the water may become\r\nground-water. (3) _The topography of the surface_ has much to do with\r\ndetermining the proportion of rainfall which becomes ground-water. If\r\nthe surface be flat, more will sink in; if it be sloping, more of it\r\nwill run off before it has time to sink. Other things being equal, the\r\nsteeper the slope the larger the proportion of the rainfall which will\r\nrun off over it. (4) _The texture of the soil_, or other material on\r\nwhich the rain falls, helps to determine what proportion of it sinks\r\nbeneath the surface. If the surface materials be porous, the water\r\nsinks readily; if of close texture, it finds less ready ingress. Other\r\nthings being equal, the closer the texture of the soil the less the\r\nproportion of the rainfall which will enter it. (5) _The texture and\r\nstructure of the rock_ beneath the surface have some influence on the\r\namount of ground-water. The rock may be stratified or massive; it may\r\nbe abundantly or sparsely jointed; it may be porous or compact. On the\r\nwhole, stratified rock is more favorable for the entrance of water\r\nthan unstratified, partly because of its greater average porosity,\r\nand partly because the planes of division between beds often allow\r\nthe passage of water. If the beds of stratified rock are vertical or\r\ninclined, water finds its way into them more readily than if they are\r\nhorizontal, in so far as it descends along stratification planes.\r\nHorizontally bedded rock, or rock which is not bedded at all, may be so\r\nmuch jointed, and the joints so open, as to allow the water to enter\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nThe conditions favorable to the sinking of abundant water below the\r\nsurface are therefore heavy precipitation, falling slowly on a surface\r\nwith little relief, a soil of open texture underlain by rock which is\r\nporous, or affected by vertical or highly inclined planes of cleavage.\r\nThe annual discharge of water by rivers is estimated to be about 22\r\npercent. of the rainfall on the land.[93]\r\n\r\n=Supply of ground-water not altogether dependent on local\r\nrainfall.=—The amount of ground-water in a given region is not always\r\nentirely dependent on the local rainfall. Ground-water is in constant\r\nmovement, and entering the soil or rock at one point it may, after\r\na long subterranean journey, reach a point far from that at which\r\nit entered. Thus beneath the Great Plains of the West there is much\r\nsubterranean water which fell on the eastern slopes of the mountains to\r\nthe west. It has flowed beneath the surface to the Plains, where some\r\nof it is now withdrawn for the purposes of irrigation in regions where\r\nrainfall is deficient. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 199) illustrates\r\nthe flow here described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 199.—Diagram illustrating the general point that\r\n  ground-water is not dependent entirely upon local supply.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 200.—Diagram illustrating the position of the\r\n  ground-water surface (the dotted line) in a region of undulatory\r\n  topography.]\r\n\r\n=The ground-water surface. Water table.=—The water table has already\r\nbeen defined (p. 71) as the upper surface of the ground-water. In\r\na flat region of uniform structure the ground-water surface is\r\nessentially level, but rises and falls with the rainfall. Where the\r\ntopography of a region is not flat, the ground-water surface is not\r\nlevel. As a rule it is higher, though farther below the surface, under\r\nan elevation than under surrounding lowlands, as illustrated by Fig.\r\n200. The explanation is not far to seek. If a hill of sand be exposed\r\nto rainfall, most of the water falling on its porous surface will sink\r\ninto it. If the precipitation continues long enough, as in a protracted\r\nrain, the hill of sand will be filled with water, the water occupying\r\nthe interstices between the grains. If the sand of the hill could be\r\nremoved, leaving the water which it contains on the same area, it would\r\nconstitute a mound perhaps a third or a fourth as high as the hill\r\nitself. If unsupported, this mound of water would spread promptly in\r\nall directions until its surface was level. While the sand remains,\r\nthe water in it constitutes a mound, and has a tendency to spread. It\r\ndoes in fact spread, but since the process involves great friction the\r\nspreading is slow. With the spreading the surface of the water in the\r\nsand sinks, and sinks fastest at the center where it is highest (_b_,\r\nFig. 201). If the process were not interrupted the surface of the\r\nwater in the hill would, in time, sink approximately to the level of\r\nthe water in the surrounding land (_d_, Fig. 201); but at every stage\r\npreceding the last, the surface of the water would be higher beneath\r\nthe summit of the hill than elsewhere, though farther from the surface.\r\nIn regions of even moderate precipitation the water surface beneath\r\nthe hills rarely sinks to the level of that in the lowlands adjacent,\r\nbefore being raised by further rains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 201.—Diagram to illustrate the relations of\r\n  ground-water to the surface.]\r\n\r\nThe water-level beneath the lowlands also sinks. Some of it finds its\r\nway into valleys, some of it sinks to greater depths, and some of it\r\nevaporates; but since the water surface beneath the elevation sinks\r\nmore rapidly than that beneath the lowland, the two approach a common\r\nlevel. Their difference will be least at the end of a drought, and\r\ngreatest just after heavy rains.\r\n\r\n=Depth to which ground-water sinks.=—The depth to which ground-water\r\npenetrates has not been determined empirically. No borings or\r\nexcavations of any sort have been made to such depths as to indicate\r\nthat its limit was being approached, though some of them are a mile\r\nor more deep. There is a popular belief that water sinks until it\r\nreaches a temperature sufficient to convert it into steam, but except\r\nfor special localities where hot lava lies near the surface, this\r\nbelief is not well founded. In the first place, it is not known at what\r\ntemperature water below the surface would be converted into steam.\r\nWhile water boils at sea-level at a temperature of 212° (Fahr.) a\r\nhigher temperature would be necessary below that level.\r\n\r\nAssuming the temperature of water sinking beneath the surface to\r\nbe 50° Fahr., its temperature must be raised 162° to bring it to\r\nthe temperature at which it would boil at sea-level. On the above\r\nassumption of initial temperature, the following table shows the depths\r\nat which water would reach a temperature of 212° Fahr. under various\r\nassumptions as to the rate of increase of temperature. It shows also\r\nthe pressure in atmospheres which would exist at these several depths\r\nif the overlying rock were full of water.\r\n\r\n                      Depth at which      Equivalent\r\n  Rate of Increase  Temperature of 212°   Pressure in\r\n   of Temperature.   would be reached.

A\r\npressure of about 200 atmospheres is the critical pressure for water;\r\nthat is, the pressure which, if increased, will prevent boiling\r\naltogether. The depth at which a pressure of 200 atmospheres would\r\nbe reached, supposing the upper rock to be full of water, is about\r\n6800 feet. The temperature of the water at this depth, under various\r\nassumptions as to initial temperature and rate of increase of heat, is\r\nshown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                       Rate of Increase    Temperature at a\r\n  Initial Temperature.  of Temperature.   Depth of 6,800 Feet.\r\n         50°             1° for 50 feet      186° Fahr.\r\n         50°             1° for 60  „        163°  „\r\n         50°             1° for 70  „        147°  „\r\n         80°             1° for 50  „        216°  „\r\n         80°             1° for 60  „        193°  „\r\n         80°             1° for 70  „        177°  „\r\n\r\nOnly one of these temperatures reaches the boiling-point of water _at\r\nsea-level_. It is therefore clear that at this depth water has not\r\neven closely approached the boiling temperature _for this depth_, and\r\nsince this is the depth of the critical pressure, it is clear that it\r\ncannot boil at any greater depth. The descent of water is therefore\r\nnot stopped, under normal conditions of crustal temperature, because\r\nit reaches its boiling-point. Locally, as in the vicinity of active or\r\nrecently extinct volcanoes, the case may be different.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that water may descend until it reaches its critical\r\ntemperature (somewhere between 610° and 635° Fahr.). The depth at which\r\nthe critical temperature would be reached, under various assumptions,\r\nis shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                        Rate of Increase   Depth of Critical\r\n  Initial Temperature.   of Temperature.

The greater depths of the table above are\r\ntherefore believed to more nearly represent the truth than the lesser\r\nones. (See discussion of underground temperature in Chapter XI.)\r\n\r\nIf descending water attained its critical temperature, the extent to\r\nwhich the resulting _water-gas_ might be absorbed is not known. _So far\r\nas limited by temperature_, therefore, it is not possible to assign\r\na limit to the descent of water under average conditions of crustal\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nOther considerations seem to place a limit to the descent of water.\r\nRock, solid and unyielding as it seems, is yet plastic when under\r\nsufficiently great pressure. The cracks and cavities affecting it\r\nare believed to descend a distance which is but slight in comparison\r\nwith the radius of the earth. Even if openings were once formed at\r\ngreater depths, they could not persist, for the adjacent rock, under\r\nthe pressure which there exists, would “flow” in, in effect (though\r\nperhaps not in principle) much as stiff liquid might, and close them.\r\nThe outer zone of the earth where cavities may exist is known as the\r\n_zone of fracture_.[94] The depth of the zone of fracture differs for\r\ndifferent rocks, but is not believed to extend below some such depth as\r\nfive or six miles, even for the most resistant.[95] It is to be noted\r\nthat these depths are less than those at which the critical temperature\r\nof water would be reached under most of the conditions, including all\r\nthe more probable ones, specified in the above table.\r\n\r\nLet it be assumed that water descends through openings in the rock\r\nto a depth of six miles. At this depth it would, under the various\r\nassumptions specified in the first and second columns of the following\r\ntable, have the temperature indicated in the third column:\r\n\r\n    Initial       Rate of Increase     Temperature at\r\n  Temperature.      of Temperature.  Depth of Six Miles.\r\n      50°           1° for 50 feet       683° Fahr.\r\n      50°           1° for 60  „         578° „\r\n      50°           1° for 70  „         502° „\r\n      80°           1° for 50  „         713° „\r\n      80°           1° for 60  „         608° „\r\n      80°           1° for 70  „         532° „\r\n\r\nIn two of these cases, namely, those in which the assumed rate of\r\nincrease of temperature is highest, the temperature of the water at\r\nthe assumed lower limit of the zone of fracture is above the critical\r\ntemperature of water. If the assumptions involved in these two cases be\r\ncorrect, water might descend to the point where it would be converted\r\ninto water-gas, and in this condition it might be occluded by the hot\r\nrock. In the other cases, involving the more probable assumptions, the\r\ncritical temperature is not reached at a depth of six miles. If pores\r\nand cracks do not extend to greater depths, liquid water could not; and\r\nsince the water at this depth has probably not reached its critical\r\ntemperature, it cannot exist as water-gas. If it does not exist in the\r\nform of water-gas, its occlusion by the hot rock substance would not\r\nbe probable. It would seem, therefore, that the descent of water under\r\nordinary conditions is much more likely to be limited by the _zone of\r\nfracture_, than by temperature.\r\n\r\n=Movement of ground-water.=[96]—Ground-water is in more or less\r\ncontinual movement. If all the water be pumped out of a well it soon\r\nfills up again to its normal level by inflow from all sides. Springs\r\nand flowing wells also demonstrate the movement of ground-water. Near\r\nthe surface the movement of ground-water is primarily downward if the\r\nmedium through which it passes is equally permeable in all directions;\r\nbut so soon as the descending water reaches the water surface, its\r\ndescent is checked and its movement is partly lateral.\r\n\r\nThe commonest sort of movement of ground-water is that exemplified\r\nas the water sinks beneath the surface, namely, slow percolation\r\nthrough the pores and cracks of the soil and rock. Ground-water is\r\nnot generally organized into definite streams, though underground\r\nstreams, mostly small, are sometimes seen in caves and crevices, and\r\nsometimes issue as springs. Most underground streams which issue as\r\nsprings probably have definite channels for short distances only\r\nbefore they issue. It is probable that ground-water frequently flows\r\nin considerable quantity along somewhat definite planes, without\r\nhaving open channels. Thus every porous bed of rock is likely to\r\nserve as the pathway along which subterranean drainage passes. This\r\nis especially true where the porous bed is underlain by an impervious\r\none. The “reservoirs” from which artesian wells draw their supply are\r\nnot usually streams or lakes, but porous beds of rock through which\r\nabundant water passes. As the supply is drawn off at one point, it is\r\nrenewed by water entering elsewhere. Since the freedom of movement of\r\nground-water is notably influenced by the porosity of the rock, and\r\nsince the rock is, on the average, most porous and the pores largest\r\nnear the surface, the movement of ground-water is, on the average,\r\ngreatest near the surface, and least at its lower limit. In general the\r\ndecrease of movement is much more rapid than the decrease in the size\r\nof the pores. It follows that while the upper part of the ground-water,\r\nespecially that above ground-water level, moves somewhat freely, the\r\nlower part moves much more slowly. It is probable, indeed, that the\r\nmovement in the lower part of the subterranean hydrosphere is extremely\r\nslight.\r\n\r\n=The amount of ground-water.=—The porosity of surface rocks varies\r\nwidely, and the porosity of but few has been determined.[97] Such\r\ndeterminations as have been made are chiefly on building stones, in\r\nwhich the range of porosity varies from a fraction of one percent.,\r\nin the case of granite, to nearly 30 percent. in the case of some\r\nsandstones. Building stone is perhaps more dense than the average\r\nsurface rock. Furthermore, such tests as have been made do not take\r\naccount of the larger cracks and openings of rock, for these would\r\nnot appear in the specimens tested; nor of the mantle rock, which\r\ngenerally contains a large amount of water. From such determinations\r\nas have been made it is estimated that the average porosity of the\r\nouter part of the lithosphere is somewhere between 5 and 10 percent.\r\nIf the porosity diminishes regularly to a depth of six miles, where\r\nit becomes zero, the average porosity to this depth would be half\r\nthe surface porosity.[98] An average porosity of two and one-half\r\npercent. would mean that the rock contains enough water to form a\r\nlayer nearly 800 feet deep. With an average porosity of 5 percent.,\r\nthis figure would be doubled.[99] While these figures are not to be\r\nregarded as measurements, they perhaps give some idea of the amount of\r\nground-water. It is this sphere of ground-water which justifies the\r\nterm _hydrosphere_, as applied to the waters of the earth.\r\n\r\n=Fate of ground-water.=—Most of the water which sinks into the earth\r\nreaches the surface again after a longer or shorter journey. Some of\r\nit is evaporated from the surface directly; some of it is taken up by\r\nplants and is passed by them into the atmosphere; some of it issues\r\nin the form of springs; some of it seeps out; some of it is drawn out\r\nthrough wells; and much of the remainder finds its way underground\r\nto the sea or to lakes, issuing as springs beneath them. A small\r\nportion of the descending waters enters into permanent combination\r\nwith mineral matter. Many minerals are known to take up water, being\r\nchanged thereby from an anhydrous to a hydrous condition. It does not\r\nnecessarily follow, however, that the total supply of water is thereby\r\ndecreasing. Minerals once hydrated may be dehydrated subsequently,\r\nthe water being set free. Furthermore, considerable quantities of\r\nwater in the form of vapor issue from volcanoes, and volcanic vents\r\noften continue to steam long after volcanic action proper has ceased.\r\nIt is probable that some, and perhaps much of the water issuing from\r\nthese vents has never been at the surface before, and it is not now\r\npossible to affirm that the supply from this source does not offset, or\r\neven surpass, the depletion of the hydrosphere resulting from mineral\r\nhydration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE WORK OF GROUND-WATER.\r\n\r\nGround-water effects very considerable results in the course of its\r\nhistory. These results are partly chemical and partly mechanical, the\r\nformer being far more important than the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Chemical Work._\r\n\r\nThe results of the chemical and chemico-physical action of water may be\r\ngrouped in several more or less distinct categories.\r\n\r\n1. The simplest effect is the _subtraction_ of soluble mineral\r\nmatter. Pure water is in itself a solvent of certain minerals; but\r\nthe carbonic-acid gas extracted from the atmosphere, and the products\r\nof organic decay extracted from the soil make ground-water a much\r\nmore efficient solvent. Something of the results which it achieves\r\nis shown by its composition. All ground-water, whether issuing as\r\nsprings or drawn out through wells, contains much more mineral matter\r\nthan the water which falls as rain, and the excess is acquired in its\r\nunderground course.\r\n\r\nThe subtraction of soluble matter from rock renders it porous. The\r\namount of material dissolved from a given place may be trivial or\r\nconsiderable, according to the character of the rock, the readiness\r\nwith which water has access to it, and the character of the water.\r\nLocally, the subtraction of mineral matter may be the chief, or even\r\nthe only appreciable, effect of the ground-water.\r\n\r\n2. It sometimes happens that ground-water with certain mineral\r\nsubstances in solution exchanges them for other substances extracted\r\nfrom the rock. Thus the process of _substitution_ is effected. By this\r\nprocess the lime carbonate of a shell imbedded in rock may be removed,\r\nmolecule by molecule, and some other substance, such as silica, left\r\nin its place. When the process is complete, the substance of the shell\r\nhas been completely removed, though its form and structure are still\r\npreserved in the new material which has taken the place of the old.\r\nBuried logs are sometimes converted into stone by the substitution\r\nof mineral matter for the vegetable tissue. This is _petrification_.\r\nPetrification is altogether distinct from _incrustation_, which simply\r\nmeans the coating of an object with mineral matter. A bird’s nest may\r\nbe incrusted with lime carbonate, but it is not thereby petrified.\r\nSolution is a necessary antecedent of substitution.\r\n\r\n3. The materials which are subtracted from the rock at one point may be\r\nadded to other rock elsewhere. Thus a third type of change, _addition_,\r\nis effected. Rock may at one time and place be rendered porous by the\r\nsubtraction of some of its substance, and the openings thus formed may\r\nsubsequently become the receptacles of deposits from solution. This is\r\nexemplified in the stalactitic deposits of many caves. Not uncommonly\r\ncracks and fissures are filled with mineral matter deposited by the\r\nwaters which pass through them. Thus arise _veins_ which, for the most\r\npart, are nothing more than cracks and crevices filled by mineral\r\nmatter brought to them in solution, and precipitated on their walls.\r\nMost veins of metallic ores have originated in this way.\r\n\r\n4. A further series of changes is effected by ground-water when it,\r\nor the mineral matter it contains, enters into combination with the\r\nmineral matter through which it passes. One of the commonest processes\r\nof this sort, hydration, has already been referred to (pp. 43 and 428);\r\nbut in the development of many of the commoner hydrous minerals changes\r\nother than hydration are involved. These changes result in _new mineral\r\ncombinations_, the new minerals being developed out of the old, usually\r\nwith some additions or subtractions. In the long course of time changes\r\nof this sort may be very great, so great indeed that large bodies of\r\nrock are radically changed, both chemically and physically. Much of the\r\nold substance may remain, but it has entered into new and more stable\r\ncombinations with the materials which the water has brought to it.\r\n\r\n=Quantitative importance of solution.=—In general, solution is probably\r\nmost effective at a relatively slight distance below the surface.\r\nIn the outermost zone of mantle rock the materials are usually less\r\nsoluble than below, for they often represent the residuum after\r\nthe soluble parts of the formation from which they originated were\r\ndissolved out. Below this zone the rock contains more soluble matter,\r\nand the water, charged with organic matter in its descent through the\r\nsoil, is in condition to dissolve it. At greater depths the water has\r\nbecome saturated to some extent, and, so far forth, less active. Here,\r\ntoo, the movement is less free. The increased pressure at considerable\r\ndepths, on the other hand, facilitates solution, which must be\r\nunderstood to take place under proper circumstances in any zone reached\r\nby the water.\r\n\r\nCalculations have been made which illustrate the quantitative\r\nimportance of the solution effected by ground-water. The springs of\r\nLeuk (Switzerland) bring to the surface annually more than 2000 tons of\r\ncalcium sulphate (gypsum) in solution, and in the same time the springs\r\nof Bath (England) bring up an amount of mineral matter in solution\r\nsufficient to make a column 9 feet in diameter, and 140 feet high.[100]\r\n\r\nThe amount of mineral matter in solution in streams is also\r\nsignificant, for while stream-water is not all derived from\r\nground-water, much of it had such an origin. In the case of several\r\nstreams, among them the Thames and the Elbe, careful estimates of the\r\namount of dissolved mineral matter have been made. Though the Thames\r\ndrains an area only about one-tenth as large as the State of New York,\r\nit is estimated to carry about 1500 tons of mineral matter in solution\r\nto the sea daily.[101]\r\n\r\nFrom the uppermost 20,000 square miles of its drainage basin the Elbe\r\nis estimated to carry yearly about 1,370,000 tons of mineral matter in\r\nsolution. Estimates of the amounts of material carried to the sea in\r\nsolution by several rivers are given on pp. 102 and 103. Much of this\r\nmatter was brought to the rivers by waters which had been underground\r\nbefore reaching the streams.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it is clear that we have to reckon here with a very\r\nconsiderable factor in the lowering of land surfaces. From the amount\r\nof lime carbonate carried by the Thames it has been estimated that\r\nthe average amount of this material dissolved from the limestone area\r\ndrained by this stream is 143[102] tons per square mile per year. It is\r\nestimated that, on the average, something like one-third as much matter\r\nis carried to the sea in solution as in the form of sediment, and that\r\nby this process alone land areas would be lowered something like one\r\nfoot in 13,000 years.[103]\r\n\r\n=Deposition of mineral matter from solution.=—The deposition of\r\nmaterial from solution is effected in several ways. (1) It is sometimes\r\ndeposited by evaporation. This is well shown where water seeps out on\r\narid lands. The same process is illustrated when water is boiled. (2)\r\nReduction of temperature often occasions deposition. In general, hot\r\nwater is a better solvent of mineral matter than cold,[104] and if it\r\nissues with abundant mineral matter in solution the precipitation of\r\nsome of it is likely to take place. (3) Plants sometimes cause the\r\nprecipitation of mineral matter from solution. About some hot springs,\r\neven where the temperature of the water is very high small plants of\r\nlow type (algæ) grow in profusion. In ways which are not perfectly\r\nunderstood these algæ extract the mineral matter from the hot water.\r\nThey are now thought to be a chief factor in the deposits about the\r\nhot springs of the Yellowstone Park.[105] The influence of organisms\r\non precipitation from solution is not confined to the waters of hot\r\nsprings. (4) A fourth factor involved in the deposition of mineral\r\nmatter from solution is pressure. Pressure increases the solvent power\r\nof water with respect to minerals directly; it produces the same effect\r\nindirectly by its effect on the solution of gases. As water charged\r\nwith gas comes to the surface, the pressure is relieved and some of the\r\ngas escapes. Such mineral matter as was held in solution by the help\r\nof the gas which escapes is then precipitated. (5) Precipitation is\r\nalso sometimes effected by the mingling of waters containing different\r\nmineral substances in solution. Such mingling of solutions would be\r\nmost common along lines of ready subterranean flow, and while each\r\nportion of the water entering a crevice or porous bed may be able to\r\nkeep its own mineral matter in solution, their mingling may involve\r\nchemical changes resulting in the formation of insoluble compounds,\r\nand therefore in deposition. This principle has probably been involved\r\nin the filling of many fissures and crevices, converting them into\r\nveins. (6) The escape of gases from water, whether from increase of\r\ntemperature or by the disturbance of water, sometimes causes the\r\ndeposition of mineral matter held in solution.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of material held in solution is most notable at two\r\nzones, one below that of most active solution, and the other at the\r\nsurface, where evaporation is active. Under proper conditions, however,\r\ndeposition may take place at any level reached by water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Mechanical Work._\r\n\r\nThe mechanical work of ground-water is relatively unimportant. Wherever\r\nit is organized into definite streams, the channels through which it\r\nflows are likely to be increased by mechanical erosion as well as by\r\nsolution. Either beneath the surface, or after the streams issue, the\r\nmechanical sediment carried will be deposited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 202.—Diagram to illustrate the general form\r\n  and relations of caves developed by solution. The black portions\r\n  represent the cavern spaces. Some limestone sinks are represented on\r\n  the surface above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 RESULTS OF THE WORK OF GROUND-WATER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 203.—Ground-plan of Wyandotte Cave. The unshaded\r\n  areas represent the passageways. (21st Ann. Rept., Ind. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Weathering.=—Where the solution effected by ground-water in any\r\nlocality is slight and equally distributed, the result is to make\r\nthe rock porous. If, for example, some of the cement of sandstone is\r\ndissolved, the texture of the rock becomes more open; but if all the\r\ncement be removed the rock is changed from sandstone to sand. If a\r\ncomplex crystalline rock contains among its many minerals some one\r\nwhich is more soluble than the others, that one may be dissolved. This\r\nhas the effect of breaking up the rock, since each mineral acts as a\r\nbinder for the rest. It might happen that no one of the minerals is\r\ndissolved completely, but that some one of them is decomposed by water,\r\nand certain of its constituents removed. Such change would be likely\r\nto cause the mineral so affected to crumble, and with its crumbling,\r\nif it be an important constituent of the rock, the integrity of the\r\nrock is destroyed. Where considerable chemical changes, especially\r\nsubtractions, are going on, the rock is likely to crumble. The increase\r\nin volume attendant on hydration, etc., sometimes leads to the\r\ndisruption of rock. These are phases of weathering. (For other phases\r\nof weathering see pp. 54 and 110.)\r\n\r\n=Caverns.=[106]—Where local solution is very great results of another\r\nsort may be effected. In formations like limestone, which are\r\nrelatively soluble, considerable quantities of material are frequently\r\ndissolved from a given place. Instead of making the rock porous, in\r\nthe usual sense of the term, large caverns may be developed (Fig.\r\n202). In their production, solution may be abetted by the mechanical\r\naction of the water passing through the openings which solution has\r\ndeveloped. Considerable caves are found chiefly in limestone. They were\r\nprobably developed when the surface relief was slight, and surface\r\ndrainage therefore poor. Regions where caves were developed under these\r\nconditions may subsequently acquire relief, so that caves are not now\r\nconfined to flat regions.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known regions of caves is in the basin of the Ohio in\r\nKentucky and southern Indiana, where the number of caves is large,\r\nand the size of some of them, such as Mammoth and Wyandotte, very\r\ngreat. A ground-plan of Wyandotte (Ind.) Cave is shown in Fig. 203. The\r\naggregate length of the passageways is about 23½ miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 204.—Deposits in Wyandotte (Ind.) Cave. (Hains.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 205.—Deposits in Wyandotte Cave. (Hains.)]\r\n\r\nDeposition often takes place in caves after they are formed (Figs. 204\r\nand 205). It may even go on at the same time that the cave is being\r\nexcavated. Here are formed the well-known stalactites and stalagmites.\r\nA stalactite may start from a drop of water leaking through the roof\r\nof the cave. Evaporation, or the escape of some of the carbonic gas in\r\nsolution, results in the deposition of some of the lime carbonate about\r\nthe margin of the drop, in the form of a ring. Successive drops make\r\nsuccessive deposits on the lower edge of the ring, which grows downward\r\ninto a hollow tube through which descending water passes, making its\r\nchief deposits at the end. Deposition in the tube may ultimately close\r\nit, while deposition on the outside, due to water trickling down in\r\nthat position, may greatly enlarge it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 206.—A limestone sink-hole, east-northeast of\r\n  Cambria, Wyo., exceptional for its steep sides. Minnekahta limestone.\r\n  (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nUnderground caves sometimes give rise to topographic features which\r\nare of local importance. When the solution of material in a cavern\r\nhas gone so far that its roof becomes thin and weak, it may collapse,\r\ngiving rise to a sink or depression in the surface over the site of\r\nthe original cave. This is so common that regions of limestone caves\r\nare often affected by frequent sinks formed in this way. They are a\r\nconspicuous feature of the landscape in the cave region of Kentucky,\r\nand are well known in many other limestone districts. They are known as\r\n_limestone sinks_. (Fig. 206 and Fig. 2, Pl. XVII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 207.—A fresh landslide near Medicine Lake, Mont.\r\n  The bare space shows the position from which the slide started.\r\n  (Whitney.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 208.—Landslide topography. The protruding mass on\r\n  the right has slumped down from the mountain to the left. South face\r\n  of Landslip Mountain, Colo., seen from the west; Rico quadrangle.\r\n  (Cross, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nUnder certain circumstances caves may give rise to striking features\r\nof another sort. If for any reason the roof is destroyed at the two\r\nends of a cave, remaining intact over the middle, the latter part\r\nconstitutes a _natural bridge_. Natural bridges also originate in other\r\nways (pp. 151, 153).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 209.—Landslide topography on Badger Mountain,\r\n  Washington. The slumping material in this case is basalt.]\r\n\r\n=Creep, slumps, and landslides.=—When the soil and subsoil on a slope\r\nbecome charged with water they tend to move downward. When the movement\r\nis too slow to be sensible it is called _creep_. The common downward\r\ninclination of trees growing in such situations, the result of the more\r\nrapid creep of the surface as compared with the deeper part of the\r\nsoil, is both an expression of the movement and of its slowness. Other\r\nfactors besides ground-water are involved in creep (see p. 112).\r\n\r\nWhen the movement is rapid enough to be sensible the material is\r\nsaid to _slump_ or _slide_. This may happen when the slope on which\r\nwater-charged mantle rock lies is steep (Fig. 207). Great landslides of\r\nthis sort have been recorded, and some of them have done great damage.\r\nWhere a stream’s banks are high, and of unindurated material, such as\r\nclay, considerable masses sometimes slump from the bank or bluff into\r\nthe river, or settle away slowly from their former positions. This is\r\na common phenomenon along streams which have cut valleys in drift,\r\nand along shores on which waves are encroaching. The same phenomenon\r\nis common on a larger scale on the slopes of steep mountains.[107]\r\nConsiderable terraces are sometimes developed on their slopes in this\r\nway, but they are usually irregular and discontinuous (Figs. 208, and\r\n209). The loose débris on steep slopes sometimes assumes a sort of\r\nflowing motion and descends the slope with some such form and at some\r\nsuch rate as a glacier. Such bodies of débris are sometimes called\r\n“talus glaciers” (Fig. 210). In many such cases, snow and ice have had\r\nsome part in their development.\r\n\r\nIn creep and in landslides gravity is the force involved, and the\r\nground-water only a condition which makes gravity effective. Gravity\r\nalone accomplishes similar results, as illustrated by Fig. 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Summary._\r\n\r\nAll in all, ground-water is to be looked upon as a most important\r\ngeological agent. When it is remembered that a very large part of all\r\nthe water which falls on the surface of the earth, either in the form\r\nof rain or snow, sinks beneath the surface; that much of it sinks to\r\na great depth; that much of it has a long underground course before\r\nit reappears at the surface; that it is everywhere and always active,\r\neither in subtracting from the rock through which it passes, in adding\r\nto it, in effecting the substitution of one mineral substance for\r\nanother, or in bringing about new chemical combinations; and when it\r\nis remembered that this process has been going on for untold millions\r\nof years, it will be seen that the total result accomplished must be\r\nstupendous. The rock formations of the earth to the depths to which\r\nground-water penetrates are to be looked upon as a sort of chemical\r\nlaboratory through which waters are circulating in all directions,\r\ncharged with all sorts of mineral substances. Some of the substances\r\nin solution are deposited beneath the surface, and some are brought to\r\nthe surface where the waters issue. Much of the material brought to\r\nthe surface in solution is carried to the sea and utilized by marine\r\norganisms in the making of shells. Without the mineral matter brought\r\nto the sea by springs and rivers, many shell-bearing animals of great\r\nimportance, geologically, would perish. Biologically, therefore, as\r\nwell as geologically, ground-water is of great importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. HUNTERDON COUNTY, NEW JERSEY.\r\n  U. S. Geol.

(Atwood.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SPRINGS AND FLOWING WELLS.\r\n\r\nThe term _spring_ is applied to any water which issues from beneath\r\nthe surface with sufficient volume to cause a distinct current. If the\r\nwater issues so slowly as to merely keep the surface moist, it is not\r\ncalled a spring, but seepage. The spring from which water issues with a\r\nstrong current, especially if it be upward, is comparable to a flowing\r\nwell, while the spring from which water issues with little force, and\r\nwithout upward movement, is comparable to the flow of water into a\r\ncommon well.\r\n\r\nSprings often issue from the sides of valleys (Fig. 212), the bottoms\r\nof which are below ground-water level. They are especially likely to\r\nissue at the surface of relatively impervious layers, and where the\r\nvalley slopes cut joints, porous beds, or other structures which allow\r\nfree flow of ground-water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 212.—Diagram illustrating positions, _a_ and _b_,\r\n  favorable for springs.]\r\n\r\nSprings are classified in various ways, and these several\r\nclassifications suggest characteristics worthy of note. They are\r\nsometimes said to be _deep_ and _shallow_. The “deep” spring, as the\r\nterm is ordinarily used, is one which issues with great force, and\r\nwith something of upward movement, and the “shallow” spring, one which\r\nissues with little force, and without upward movement; but the spring\r\nwhich issues with force is not necessarily deep, nor is the one which\r\nissues with little force necessarily shallow. The idea involved in\r\nthis grouping would be better expressed by _strong_ and _feeble_.\r\nSprings are also classified as _cold_ and _thermal_, the latter term\r\nmeaning simply that the temperature is such as to make the springs\r\nseem warm or hot. The temperature of thermal springs ranges up to the\r\nboiling-point of water. Between deep springs and shallow ones, and\r\nbetween cold springs and thermal, respectively, there is no sharp line\r\nof demarkation. Again, some springs are continuous in their flow, while\r\nothers are _intermittent_. Most intermittent springs flow after periods\r\nof precipitation, but dry up during droughts (see p. 202). Springs are\r\nalso classified as _mineral_ and _common_. Mineral springs, in the\r\npopular sense of the term, are of two types: (1) Those which contain\r\nan unusual amount of mineral matter, and (2) those which contain some\r\nunusual mineral. Springs are especially likely to be called mineral\r\nif the substances which they contain, have, or are supposed to have,\r\nsome medicinal property. All springs which are not “mineral” are\r\n“common.” This classification is not altogether rational, for all\r\nsprings contain more or less mineral matter, and many springs which\r\nare “common,” contain more mineral matter than some springs that are\r\n“mineral.” Mineral springs are themselves classified according to the\r\nkind and amount of mineral matter they contain. Thus _saline_ springs\r\ncontain salt; _sulphur_ springs contain compounds (especially gaseous)\r\nof sulphur; _chalybeate_ springs contain iron compounds, especially\r\nthe sulphate; _calcareous_ springs contain abundant lime carbonate,\r\netc. These various mineral substances are extracted from the rock,\r\nsometimes by simple solution, and sometimes by solution resulting from\r\nother chemical change. The salt of saline springs is usually extracted\r\nfrom beds of salt beneath the surface. Lime carbonate, one of the\r\ncommonest substances in solution in ground-water, is dissolved from\r\nlimestone, or derived by chemical change from rocks containing other\r\ncalcium compounds. Thus lime feldspars, by carbonation, give rise to\r\nlime carbonate. The chalybeate waters often arise from the oxidation\r\nof iron sulphide, a mineral which is common in many sedimentary rocks.\r\nThe iron sulphate is itself subject to change in the presence of the\r\nubiquitous lime carbonate. From this change iron carbonate results, and\r\nthis is usually quickly altered to iron oxide, which, being relatively\r\ninsoluble, is precipitated. About chalybeate springs, therefore, iron\r\noxide is frequently being deposited. _Medicinal_ springs are those\r\nwhich contain some substance or substances which have, or are supposed\r\nto have, curative properties.\r\n\r\n=Mineral matter in solution.=—The number and variety of mineral\r\nsubstances in spring water is very great, and the amount of solid\r\nmatter in solution varies widely. Some of the hot springs of the\r\nYellowstone Park contain nearly three grams (2.8733) of mineral matter\r\nper kilogram.[108]\r\n\r\nThe composition of various spring and well waters is shown in the\r\naccompanying table, which gives some idea of the range of mineral\r\nsubstances commonly in solution in ground-water.\r\n\r\n=Geysers.=—Geysers are intermittently eruptive hot springs. They occur\r\nonly in volcanic regions (past or present) and in but few of them.\r\nActive geysers are virtually confined to the Yellowstone Park and\r\nIceland, though they formerly existed at other places. Those of New\r\nZealand have but recently become extinct. The great geyser region of\r\nthe world is the Yellowstone Park, where there are said to be more than\r\nsixty active geysers.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the eruption is steam. The surface-water sinks down until,\r\nat some unknown depth, it comes into contact with rock sufficiently hot\r\nto boil it. The source of the heat is not open to inspection, but it is\r\nbelieved to be the uncooled part of an extrusive lava flow, or of an\r\nintrusive lava mass. From what was said on pp. 216 and 217 it is clear\r\nthat geysers do not have their origin in water which sinks down to the\r\nzone of great heat, where the increment of heat is normal.\r\n\r\nThe water of a geyser issues through a tube of unknown length. Whether\r\nthe tube is open down to the source of the heat is not determinable,\r\nbut water from such a source finds its way to the tube. Water may enter\r\nthe tube from all sides and at various levels from top to bottom. The\r\nheating may precede or follow its entrance into the tube, or both. So\r\nfar as the water is heated after it enters the tube, the point of most\r\nrapid heating may be at the bottom of the tube or at some point above.\r\nIf the temperature of the source of heat were high enough to convert\r\nthe descending water into steam as fast as it enters the tube, the\r\nsteam would escape continuously, though there would be no geyser; but\r\nif the rock is only hot enough to bring the water to the boiling-point\r\nafter some lapse of time, and after some water has accumulated, an\r\neruption is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ANALYSES OF AMERICAN SPRING-WATERS.[109]\r\n         [+Reduced to Parts per 1000 by Dr H.

+Fig.+ 213.—“Old Faithful” in eruption.]\r\n\r\nThe exact sequence of events which leads up to an eruption is not\r\nknown, but a definite conception of the principles involved may\r\nperhaps be secured by a definite case. Suppose a geyser-tube filled\r\nwith water, and heated at its lower end. As the water is heated below,\r\nconvection tends to distribute the heat throughout the column of\r\nwater above. If convection were free, and the tube short, the result\r\nwould be a boiling spring; but if the tube is long, and especially\r\nif convection is impeded, the water at some level below the surface\r\nmay be brought to the boiling-point earlier than that at the top.\r\nUnder these circumstances if even a little water in the lower part of\r\nthe tube is converted into steam, the steam will raise the column of\r\nwater above, and it will overflow. The overflow relieves the pressure\r\non all parts of the column of water below the surface. If before the\r\noverflow there was any considerable volume of water essentially ready\r\nto boil, the relief of pressure following the overflow might allow it\r\nto be converted into steam suddenly, and the sudden conversion of any\r\nconsiderable quantity of water into steam would cause the eruption of\r\nall the water above it (Figs. 213 and 214). The height to which the\r\nwater would be thrown would depend upon the amount of steam, the size\r\nand straightness of the tube, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that everything which impedes convection in the geyser\r\ntube will hasten the period of eruption, since impeded circulation\r\nwill have the effect of holding the heat down, and so of bringing the\r\nwater at some level below the top more quickly to the boiling-point.\r\nIt follows that anything which chokes up the tube, or which increases\r\nthe viscosity of the water, or its surface tension, would hasten an\r\neruption.[119]\r\n\r\nGeysers often build up crater-like basins or cones (Figs. 214 to 217)\r\nabout themselves, the cone being of material deposited from solution.\r\nIn the Yellowstone Park the precipitation of the matter in solution\r\n(chiefly silica) is partly due to cooling and partly to the algæ which\r\nabound even in the boiling water, and the brilliant colors of the\r\ndeposits about the springs are attributable to these plants. When the\r\nwater from any geyser or hot spring ceases to flow the plants die and\r\nthe colors disappear. The details of the surface of the deposits about\r\ngeysers and hot springs are often complicated, and frequently very\r\nbeautiful (Fig. 218).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 214.—“Giant” Geyser, Yellowstone Park, in\r\n  eruption. Shows also the cone. (Wineman.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 215.—Cone (or crater) of Castle Geyser,\r\n  Yellowstone Park. (Detroit Photo. Co.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 216.—Cone (or crater) of Grotto Geyser,\r\n  Yellowstone Park. (Detroit Photo. Co.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 217.—Cone of Giant Geyser, Yellowstone Park.\r\n  (Wineman.)]\r\n\r\nThe heating of geyser and hot-spring water must cool the lava or\r\nother source of heat below. As this takes place, the time between\r\neruptions becomes longer and longer. In the course of time, therefore,\r\nthe geyser must cease to be eruptive, and when this change is brought\r\nabout the geyser becomes a hot spring. Within historic times several\r\ngeysers have ceased to erupt and new ones have been developed. In the\r\nYellowstone Park, where there are said to be something like 3000 vents\r\nof all sorts, hot springs which are not eruptive greatly outnumber the\r\ngeysers. From many of the vents but little steam issues, and from some,\r\nlittle else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 218.—Hot springs deposits. Terraces of Mammoth\r\n  Hot Springs, Yellowstone Park.]\r\n\r\nA few geysers have somewhat definite periods of eruption. Of such “Old\r\nFaithful” is the type; but even this geyser, which formerly erupted at\r\nregular intervals of about an hour, is losing the reputation on which\r\nits name is based. Not only is its period of eruption lengthening,\r\nbut it is becoming irregular, and the irregularity appears to be\r\nincreasing. In the short time during which this geyser has been under\r\nobservation its period has changed from a regular one of sixty minutes,\r\nor a little less, to an irregular one of seventy to ninety minutes.\r\nIn the case of some geysers years elapse between eruptions, and in\r\nsome the date of the last eruption is so distant that it is uncertain\r\nwhether the vent should be looked upon as a geyser or merely a hot\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIn the Yellowstone Park[120] the geysers are mainly in the bottoms\r\nof valleys (Fig. 219), but the deposits characteristic of geysers\r\nare found in not a few places well above the present bottoms. These\r\ndeposits record the fact that in earlier times the geysers were at\r\nhigher levels than now. It is probable that they have been, at all\r\nstages in their history, near the bottoms of the valleys, and that, as\r\nthe valleys have been deepened the ground-water has found lower and\r\nlower points of issue. In this respect the geysers have probably had\r\nthe same history as other springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 219.—Hot springs and geysers. Norris Geyser\r\n  basin, Yellowstone Park.]\r\n\r\nUnless new intrusions of lava occur, or unless heat is otherwise\r\nrenewed at the proper points, it is probable that all existing geysers\r\nwill become extinct within a time which is, geologically, short. New\r\ngeyser regions may, however, develop as old ones disappear.\r\n\r\n=Artesian wells.=—Originally the terms _artesian_ wells and _flowing_\r\nwells were synonymous; but at the present time any notably deep well\r\nis called _artesian_, especially if it descends to considerable depths\r\nbelow the mantle rock. The artesian well which does not flow, does not\r\ndiffer from common wells in principle; but being deeper, the water\r\nwhich it affords is often more thoroughly filtered and frequently more\r\nhighly mineralized than that of other wells. The flowing well is really\r\na gushing spring, the opening of which was made by man.\r\n\r\nFlowing wells[121] depend upon certain relations of rock structure,\r\nwater supply, and elevation. Generally speaking a flowing well is\r\npossible in any place underlain by any considerable bed of porous rock,\r\nif such rock outcrops at a sufficiently higher level in a region of\r\nadequate rainfall, and is covered by a layer or bed of impervious, or\r\nrelatively impervious rock. This statement involves four conditions,\r\nall of which are illustrated by Fig. 199, where _a_ is the bed\r\nof porous rock. It is not necessary that the beds of rock form a\r\nstructural basin, nor is it usually necessary to take account of the\r\ncharacter of the rock beneath the porous bed which contains the water.\r\n\r\nThe bed of porous rock is the “reservoir” of the flowing well.\r\nFormations of sand or sandstone, and of gravel or conglomerate, most\r\ncommonly serve as the reservoirs. In order that it may contain abundant\r\nwater it must have some thickness, and its outcropping edge must be so\r\nsituated that the water may enter freely and be replenished, chiefly by\r\nrain, as the water flows out at the well.\r\n\r\nA relatively impervious layer of rock above the reservoir (_b_, Fig.\r\n199) is most important; otherwise the water in the reservoir will\r\nleak out, and there will be little or no “head” at the well site.\r\nThus if the rock overlying stratum _a_ (Fig. 199) were badly broken,\r\nthe fractures extending up to the surface, the conditions would be\r\nunfavorable for flowing wells. Under such conditions, wells in the\r\npositions of those shown in Fig. 199 might get abundant water, but they\r\nwould not be likely to flow. If the stratum next below the reservoir\r\nis not impervious, some lower one probably is. No layer of rock is more\r\nimpervious than one which is full of water, and the substructure of any\r\nbed which might serve as a reservoir is usually full of water, even if\r\nthe rock be porous.\r\n\r\nIf the outcrop of the reservoir be notably above the site of the well,\r\nand if it be kept full by frequent rains, the “head” will be strong,\r\nthough the water at the well will not rise to the level of the outcrop\r\nof the reservoir. Experience has shown that an allowance of about one\r\nfoot per mile of subterranean flow should be made. Thus if the site of\r\nthe well be 100 miles from the outcrop of the water-bearing stratum,\r\nand 200 feet below it, the water will rise something like 100 feet\r\nabove the surface at the well. This rule is, however, not applicable\r\neverywhere. The failure of the water to rise to the level of its head\r\nis due to the adhesion and the friction of flow through the rock. The\r\nmore porous the rock the less the reduction of head by friction. The\r\nheight of the flow is also influenced by the number of wells drawing on\r\nthe same reservoir, on the degree of imperviousness of the confining\r\nbed above, etc.\r\n\r\nFlowing wells, often relatively shallow, are frequently obtained from\r\nunconsolidated drift. Some such relations as suggested by Fig. 220\r\nwould afford the conditions for flowing wells in such a formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 220.—Figure illustrating the principle of\r\n  artesian wells in drift.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                       THE WORK OF SNOW AND ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA part of the atmospheric precipitation falls as snow, and this, like\r\nthe rain, does its appropriate work in degrading the land. Over the\r\nlarger part of the land surface the snow of the winter does not endure\r\nthrough the succeeding summer, and when it melts it follows the same\r\ncourse as the precipitation which falls as rain; but in cold regions\r\nwhere the fall of snow is heavy some of it remains unmelted and\r\nconstitutes perennial snow-fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SNOW- AND ICE-FIELDS.\r\n\r\n=Snow-fields.=—Mountain heights and polar lands are the most common\r\nhabitats of snow-fields, though they are not confined to these\r\nsituations. In North America there are numerous small snow-fields in\r\nthe western mountains, from Mexico on the south to Alaska on the north,\r\ntheir number and size increasing in the latter direction. In the United\r\nStates there are few snow-fields south of the parallel of 36° 30′, and\r\nmost of the many hundreds north of that latitude (excluding Alaska) are\r\nsmall (Pl. XVIII, Fig. 1, Washington, lat. 48° 5′, long. 121° 5′; Fig.\r\n2, lat. 41° 25′, long. 122° 12′. From Glacier Peak and Shasta Special\r\nQuadrangles, U. S. Geol. Surv.). Farther north, especially in Alaska,\r\nthe snow-fields of the western mountains attain much greater size. In\r\nEurope snow-fields comparable to those of the northwestern part of\r\nthe United States and British Columbia occur in the Alps (Fig. 221),\r\nthe Pyrenees, the Caucasus, and the Scandinavian mountains. In Asia\r\nsnow-fields occur in the Himalayas and in many of the high mountains\r\nfarther north, from Turkestan on the southwest nearly to the coast on\r\nthe northeast. In South America there are snow-fields of small size\r\neven in equatorial latitudes, and farther south in the Chilean Andes\r\nthere are some of considerable size. Small snow-fields occur on the\r\nhighest peaks of tropical Africa, and in the mountains of New Zealand.\r\nFor reasons which will appear later, much of every considerable\r\nsnow-field is really ice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these limited fields of snow in mountain regions, there\r\nare fields of much greater extent covering wide expanses of plain\r\nand plateau in the polar regions. The greater part of the island of\r\nGreenland is covered with a single field of ice and snow, the size of\r\nwhich is variously estimated at 300,000 to 400,000 square miles (Fig.\r\n222)—an area 400 to 600 times as large as the snow-and-ice-covered\r\narea of Switzerland. Numerous islands to the west of North Greenland\r\nare also partly covered with snow, the areas of the snow-fields far\r\nexceeding those of most mountain regions. In Antarctica there is\r\nbelieved to be a still larger field, the largest of the earth. Its area\r\nis not even approximately known, but such data as are at hand indicate\r\nthat it may have an extent of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 square miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 221.—An alpine snow-field.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 222.—Map of Greenland. The borders only are free\r\n  from ice. (Stieler.)]\r\n\r\nThe only condition necessary for a snow-field is an excess of snowfall\r\nover snow waste. The lower edge of a snow-field, the _snow-line_, is\r\ndependent chiefly on temperature and snowfall. In general it does not\r\ndepart much from the summer isotherm of 32°, though it may be well\r\nabove this isotherm where the snowfall is light. That the snow-line\r\nis not a function of temperature only is shown by its position in\r\nvarious places. In the equatorial portion of the Andes, for example,\r\nthe snow-line has an altitude of about 16,000 feet on the east side of\r\nthe mountains, where the precipitation is heavier, and of about 18,500\r\nfeet on the west side, where it is lighter. For the same reason the\r\nsnow-line in the Himalayas is 3000 or 4000 feet lower on the _south_\r\nside than on the north.\r\n\r\nWhile in equatorial regions the snow-line has an altitude of 15,000 to\r\n18,000 feet, it approaches or even reaches sea-level in the latitude\r\nof Antarctica and North Greenland. In intermediate latitudes it has an\r\nintermediate position.\r\n\r\nWhile temperature and snowfall are the most important factors\r\ncontrolling the position of the snow-line, both humidity and the\r\nmovements of the air are of some importance, since both affect the rate\r\nof evaporation of snow and ice.\r\n\r\n=The passage of snow into névé and ice.=—The snow does not lie on the\r\nsurface long before it undergoes obvious change. The light flakes\r\nsoon begin to be transformed into granules, and the snow becomes\r\n“coarse-grained.” The granular character, so pronounced in the snow of\r\nthe last banks which remain in the spring in temperate latitudes, is\r\neven more distinct in perennial snow-fields, either at the surface or\r\njust beneath it. This granular snow is called _névé_, or _firn_. Still\r\ndeeper beneath the surface, where the thickness of the snow is great,\r\nthe névé becomes more compact and finally coherent, and grades into\r\nporous ice. This gradation is accomplished at no great depth, though\r\nthe thicknesses of snow and névé are by no means constant.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the ice.=—Ice formed beneath a snow-field is in some\r\nsense stratified. It is made up of successive falls of snow which\r\ntend to retain the form of layers. This follows from two or three\r\nconditions. The snow of one season, or of one period of precipitation,\r\nmay have been considerably changed before the succeeding fall of snow.\r\nSo also the surface of the snow-field at the end of the melting season\r\nis often covered with a visible amount of earthy matter, some of which\r\nwas blown up and dropped on the surface during the melting season, and\r\nsome of which was concentrated in that position by the melting of the\r\nsnow in which it was originally imbedded. The amount of earthy matter\r\nis often sufficient to define snows of successive years, or perhaps of\r\nminor periods of precipitation, and makes distinct the stratification\r\nwhich would otherwise remain obscure. The snowfall of successive years\r\nhas been estimated by this means[122] where the snow is exposed in\r\ncrevices in the snow-field.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its rude stratification, the ice of the deeper portions\r\noften acquires a stratiform structure which may perhaps best be called\r\n_foliation_ to distinguish it from the _stratification_ which arises\r\nfrom deposition. The foliation appears to result mainly from the\r\nshearing of one part over another in the course of the movements to\r\nwhich the ice is subjected, as will be illustrated presently.\r\n\r\n=Texture.=—The ice derived from the snow is formed of interlocking\r\ncrystalline grains. The crystalline character is present from the\r\nbeginning, for it is assumed by the snowflakes when they form, and\r\nthe subsequent changes seem only to modify the original crystals\r\nby building up some and destroying others. By the time the snow is\r\nconverted into névé, the granules have become coarse, and wherever the\r\nice derived from the névé has been examined, the granular crystalline\r\ntexture is present. The individual crystals in the ice are usually\r\nlarger than those of the névé, and more closely grown together. In the\r\nfresh unexposed ice the crystals are so intimately interlocked that\r\nthey are not readily seen except under a polarizing microscope, but\r\nwhen the ice has been honeycombed by partial melting, the granules\r\nbecome partially separated and may be easily seen. Fig. 223 shows\r\nquantities of them which have been washed down from the surface,\r\nand disposed as cones at its base. While a given mass of snow in a\r\ngreat snow- and ice-field cannot be followed consecutively through\r\nits whole history, yet since (1) the granular texture is pronounced\r\nin the névé stage where the granules show evidences of growth, and\r\nsince (2) the same texture is also pronounced in the last stages of\r\nthe ice when it is undergoing dissolution, as well as at all observed\r\nintermediate stages, and since (3) the crystals are, on the average,\r\nlarger in proportion to the lateness of the stage of their history,\r\nwhile (4) experiment has shown that granules grow under the conditions\r\nwhich exist in snow-fields, and (5) that they persist under very\r\nconsiderable pressure, it is legitimate to assume that a granular\r\ncrystalline condition persists throughout all stages, and is a feature\r\nof progressive growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 223.—Figure showing cones of granules of ice\r\n  which have been washed down the front of the glacier by streamlets,\r\n  and accumulated after the manner of talus or alluvial cones. North\r\n  Greenland.]\r\n\r\n=Inauguration of movement.=—Eventually the increase in depth of\r\nsnow and ice in a snow-field gives rise to motion. The exact nature\r\nof the motion has not yet been demonstrated to the satisfaction of\r\nall investigators. Brittle and resistant as ice seems, it exhibits,\r\nunder proper conditions, some of the outward characteristics of a\r\nplastic substance. Thus it may be made to change its form, and may\r\neven be moulded into almost any desired shape if carefully subjected\r\nto sufficient pressure, steadily applied through long intervals\r\nof time.[123] These changes may be brought about without visible\r\nfracture, and have been thought to point to a viscous condition of the\r\nice. There is much reason, however, as will be seen later, to question\r\nthis interpretation of the ultimate nature of the movement. Whatever\r\nthis may be, the _mass result_ of the movement in a field of ice is\r\ncomparable, in a superficial way at least, to that which would be\r\nbrought about if the ice were capable of moving like a viscous liquid,\r\nthe motion taking place with extreme slowness. This slow motion of ice\r\nin an ice-field is _glacier motion_, and ice thus moving is _glacier\r\nice_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 224.—Ice-caps of small size. The figure also\r\n  shows some valley glaciers extending out from the main ice-sheet and\r\n  from the local ice-caps. A portion of the North Greenland coast,\r\n  north of Inglefield Gulf. Lat. about 78°. (Peary.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 225.—Small ice-caps in the northwestern part of\r\n  Iceland. (Thoraddsen’s geological map of Iceland.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 226.—A glacial lobe, midway between an ice-cap\r\n  and a valley glacier. A protrusion from a local ice-cap east of Cape\r\n  York, Greenland.]\r\n\r\nIf both the surface on which the ice-sheet develops and its\r\nsurroundings be essentially plane, as may happen in high latitudes,\r\nand if the snow- and ice-field be symmetrical in shape, the outward\r\nmovement will be approximately equal in all directions, and the area\r\ncovered by the spreading ice-field will remain more or less circular.\r\nIf the ice-field rests on a steeply inclined surface, like a mountain\r\nslope, the movement becomes one-sided in conformity to the slope. If\r\nthe surface, otherwise plane, be affected by valleys parallel to the\r\ndirection of movement, the ice in the valleys will be deeper than\r\nthat on the divides between them, and its movement stronger. In the\r\nvalleys, therefore, the ice will advance farther than elsewhere before\r\nbeing melted, and the outline of the ice will become lobate, the lobes\r\noccupying the depressions. These general relations are shown in Figs.\r\n224 and 225. If the depressions be wide and shallow, the lobes will be\r\nbroad and short (Fig. 226); if the depressions be narrow and deep, the\r\nlobes will be relatively narrow and long. If the snow and ice rest on\r\na surface consisting chiefly of steep valleys and sharp ridges, as is\r\ncommon on mountain slopes, the snow and ice are chiefly gathered in the\r\nvalleys, and take a linear form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TYPES OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThese different forms give rise to different terms. The ice which\r\nspreads with some approach to equality in all directions from a center\r\nis a glacier, is indeed the type of the greatest glaciers, but is\r\ncommonly called an _ice-cap_. The same name is applied to any glacier\r\nin which there is movement in all directions from the center, even\r\nthough its shape departs widely from a circle. The glacier covering\r\nthe larger part of Greenland (Fig. 222) is a good example of a large\r\nice-cap, and the glaciers on some of the flat-topped peninsular\r\npromontories of the same island are good examples of small ones (Fig.\r\n224). If ice-caps cover a large part of a continent, as some of those\r\nof the past have done, they are often called _continental glaciers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 227.—Characteristic end of a North Greenland\r\n  (Bryant) glacier.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 228.—The Rhône glacier. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 229.—Characteristic end of a North Greenland\r\n  glacier. North side of Herbert Island, Inglefield Gulf.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 230.—The end of an alpine (Forno, Switzerland)\r\n  glacier. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 231.—Deploying end of a North Greenland glacier.]\r\n\r\nWhere ice-caps are developed on plateaus whose borders are trenched\r\nby valleys, ice-tongues from the edge of the ice-cap often extend\r\ndown into the valleys and give rise to one type of _valley glacier_\r\n(Figs. 224 and 227). A second and more familiar type of valley glacier\r\noccupies mountain valleys, and is the offspring of mountain snow-fields\r\n(Fig. 228). The former are confined chiefly to high latitudes, and are\r\ndistinguished as _polar_ or _high-latitude_ glaciers (Figs. 227 and\r\n229); the latter are known as _alpine_ glaciers (Figs. 228 and 230).\r\nThe end and side slopes of polar glaciers are, as a rule, much steeper\r\nthan those of alpine glaciers. When a valley glacier descends through\r\nits valley to the plain beyond, its end deploys, forming a fan (Fig.\r\n231). The deploying ends of adjacent glaciers sometimes merge, and the\r\nresulting body of ice constitutes a _piedmont glacier_ (Fig. 232). At\r\nthe present time, piedmont glaciers are confined to high latitudes. In\r\nsome cases the snow-field that gives rise to a glacier is restricted\r\nto a relatively small depression in the side of a mountain, or in the\r\nescarpment of a plateau. In such cases the snow-field and glacier are\r\nhardly distinguishable, and the latter descends but little below\r\nthe snow-line. In many cases it does not even enter the narrow valley\r\nwhich leads out from the depression occupied by the snow-field. Such\r\na glacier is nestled in the face of a cliff, and may therefore be\r\ncalled a _cliff glacier_[124] (Figs. 233 and 234). The snow-field of a\r\ncliff glacier is sometimes no more than a great snowdrift, accumulated\r\nthrough successive years. Cliff glaciers are often as wide as long,\r\nand are always small, and between them and valley glaciers there are\r\nall gradations (Fig. 235). Occasionally the end of a valley glacier,\r\nor the edge of an ice-sheet reaches a precipitous cliff, and the end\r\nor edge of the ice breaks off and accumulates like talus below. The\r\nice fragments may then again become a coherent mass by regelation, and\r\nthe whole may resume motion. Such a glacier is called a _reconstructed\r\nglacier_. The precipitous cliffs of the Greenland coast furnish\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 232.—The Malaspina glacier, Alaska; the best\r\n  known example of a piedmont glacier. (Russell.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 233.—A cliff glacier. North Greenland type. North\r\n  side of Herbert Island, Inglefield Gulf. The lower half of the white\r\n  area is snow, and snow talus. So also are the white patches to the\r\n  right. The height of the cliff is perhaps 2000 feet. The water in the\r\n  foreground is the sea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 234.—Chancy glacier; a cliff glacier of the\r\n  Montana type. (Shepard.)]\r\n\r\nOf the foregoing types of glaciers, the ice-caps far exceed all others\r\nboth in size and importance, while the valley glaciers out-rank, in the\r\nsame respects, the other types; but since the valley glaciers are the\r\nmost familiar type, the general phenomena of glaciers will be discussed\r\nwith primary reference to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE GENERAL PHENOMENA OF GLACIERS.[125]\r\n\r\n=Dimensions.=—Glaciers which occupy valleys leading down from\r\nsnow-fields sometimes reach the upper parts of the valleys only,\r\nsometimes extend through them, and sometimes push out on the plain\r\nbeyond. In length they range from a fraction of a mile to many\r\nmiles, and though their width is usually much less than their length,\r\nthe reverse is sometimes the case (Figs. 233, 234, and 235). Their\r\nthickness is usually measured by hundreds of feet rather than by\r\ndenominations of other orders, but the variation is great, and exact\r\nmeasurements are almost wholly wanting. The minimum thickness is that\r\nnecessary to cause movement, and this varies with the slope, the\r\ntemperature, and other conditions. There is also much variation in the\r\nthickness in different parts of a glacier. As a rule, it is thinnest in\r\nits terminal portion, and thickest at some point intermediate between\r\nthis and its source, but nearer the latter than the former. Cliff and\r\nreconstructed glaciers are comparable in size to the smaller valley\r\nglaciers. Piedmont glaciers may attain greater size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 235.—A glacier in the Cascades near Cascade Pass,\r\n  Wash. A glacier intermediate between a cliff glacier and a valley\r\n  glacier. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nAn ice-cap is theoretically thickest at its center and thins away to\r\nits borders, but its actual dimensions are influenced by the topography\r\non which it is developed. The Greenland ice-cap is known to rise about\r\n9000 feet above the sea, and it probably reaches considerably higher\r\nthan this in the unexplored center of its broad dome. The height of the\r\nland surface beneath is unknown, but it is unlikely that it averages\r\nhalf this amount, and hence the ice is probably 5000 feet or more thick\r\nin the center. There is reason to think that it is much thicker in\r\nAntarctica.\r\n\r\n=Limits.=—The ice of a glacier is always moving forward (neglecting\r\ntemporary halts), but the _end_ of a glacier may be retreating,\r\nadvancing or remaining stationary, according as the rate of wastage is\r\ngreater, less, or just equal to the forward movement of the ice. The\r\nposition of the lower end of the glacier is therefore determined by the\r\nratio of movement to wastage. Its upper end is generally ill-defined.\r\nIn a superficial sense, it is the point where the ice emerges from the\r\nsnow-field; but the lower limit of the snow-field is often ill-defined,\r\nand in any case is not the true upper limit of the glacier, since there\r\nmust be movement from the granular mass of ice beneath the snow to\r\nmake up for the waste below, and the moving ice beneath the snow-field\r\nwhich feeds the tongue of ice in the valley is just as really a part\r\nof the glacier as the more consolidated portion in the valley below.\r\nIf a definite upper limit for an alpine glacier is to be named, it\r\nshould probably be the _Bergschrund_, a gaping crevasse, or series of\r\ncrevasses which sometimes open near the precipitous slope of the peak\r\nor cliff where the snow-field lies. The _Bergschrund_ is formed by the\r\nmoving of the lower part of the snow-field away from the portion above.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of a glacier is usually free from snow and névé in\r\nsummer, but, traced toward its source, it first becomes covered with\r\nnévé, then with snow, and finally merges into the snow-field without\r\nhaving ceased to be a glacier. The term glacier is, however, commonly\r\nused to mean merely the more solid portion outside (below) the névé.\r\n\r\n=Movement.=—The fact of glacier movement is established in various\r\nways, the most obvious being by the advance of its lower end. Such\r\nadvance is too slow to be seen from day to day, and is only detected\r\nwhen the lower end of the glacier overrides or overturns objects in\r\nfront of it, or moves out over ground previously unoccupied. But even\r\nwhen the end of a glacier is not advancing, the movement of the ice may\r\nbe established by means of stakes or other marks set on the surface.\r\nIf the positions of these marks relative to fixed points on the sides\r\nof the valley be determined, they are found after a time to have moved\r\ndown the valley. Rows of stakes or lines of stones set across a glacier\r\nin the upper, middle and lower portions have revealed many facts\r\nconcerning the movement of the ice.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the middle of a valley glacier moves more rapidly\r\nthan its sides (Fig. 236), but in some cases, especially in large\r\nglaciers, there are found to be two or more main lines of movement,\r\nwith belts of lesser movement between. The top of a glacier moves, on\r\nthe whole, more rapidly than the bottom, though the observations made\r\ndo not show that the rate of movement diminishes regularly downward,\r\nand it probably does not so diminish in many cases. In Switzerland,\r\nwhere the glaciers have been studied more carefully than elsewhere,\r\nthe determined rates of movement range from one or two inches to four\r\nfeet or more per day. Some of the larger glaciers in other regions\r\nmove more rapidly, but it does not follow that large glaciers always\r\nmove faster than small ones. The Muir glacier of Alaska has been found\r\nto move seven feet or more per day,[126] and some of the glaciers of\r\nGreenland have been found to move, in the summer time, 50, 60, or even\r\nmore feet per day. A single estimate as high as 100 feet per day has\r\nbeen made; but these high rates have been observed only where the ice\r\nof a large inland area crowds down into a comparatively narrow fjord,\r\nand debouches into the sea, and then only in the summer. In the case of\r\nthe glacier with the highest recorded rate of summer movement, 100 feet\r\nper day, the advance was only 34 feet at about the same place in April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 236.—Diagram to show the rate of movement of the\r\nRhone Glacier at various points in its course at centre and sides. It\r\nalso shows the fluctuations in the positions of the end of the glacier\r\nbetween 1874 and 1882, and the profile of the ice. (Heim.)]\r\n\r\nThe _average_ movement of the border of the inland ice of Greenland is\r\nvery small. Rink says that “between 62° and 68° 30′, the edge of the\r\ninland ice is almost stationary for a remarkably long distance.”[127]\r\nThe observations of the authors between 77° and 78° were of like\r\nimport. Probably the average movement of the border of the Greenland\r\nice-cap is less than one foot a week.\r\n\r\n=Conditions affecting rate of movement.=—The rate of glacier movement\r\nappears to depend on (1) the depth of the moving ice; (2) the slope of\r\nthe surface over which it moves; (3) the slope of the upper surface\r\nof the ice; (4) the topography of the bed over which it passes; (5)\r\nthe temperature; and (6) the amount of water which falls upon it or\r\nis carried to it by the drainage of its surroundings, in addition to\r\nthat produced by the melting of the glacier itself. Great thickness,\r\na steep slope, much water, smoothness of bed, and a high (for ice)\r\ntemperature favor rapid movement. Since some of these conditions,\r\nnotably temperature and amount of water, vary with the season, the rate\r\nof movement for any given glacier is not constant throughout the year.\r\nOther conditions, especially the first of those mentioned above, vary\r\nthrough longer periods of time, and occasion periodic variations in the\r\nrate of movement.\r\n\r\nSince the volume of ice concerned influences the rate of movement,\r\nanything which changes the volume affects the rate. An excess of\r\nsnowfall with favorable conditions for its preservation for a period\r\nof years, increases the volume of ice, and tends to accelerate its\r\nmovement. A deficiency in snowfall, or in its preservation, as from\r\nhigh average temperature or from aridity, diminishes the quantity of\r\nice, and so retards the movement. An acceleration of velocity causes\r\nthe ice to move down the valley farther before being melted, that\r\nis, causes the end of the glacier to advance, while a decrease of\r\nvelocity produces the opposite effect. As a matter of fact, the lower\r\nends of glaciers advance for a period of years and then retreat, to\r\nadvance again at a later time.[128] Observation has shown that the\r\nperiods of advance follow a succession of years when the snowfall\r\nhas been heavy and the temperature low, while the periods of retreat\r\nfollow a succession of years when the snowfall has been light and the\r\ntemperature above the average. The periods of advance and retreat lag\r\nbehind the periods of heavy and light snowfall respectively, by some\r\nyears, and a long glacier responds less promptly than a short one.\r\nPresent knowledge seems to point to a period of 35 to 40 years as the\r\ntime within which a cycle of fluctuation, that is, an advance and a\r\nretreat, takes place.\r\n\r\nA declining upper surface is essential to glacier motion. There are\r\nshort stretches where this is not the case, and indeed there are\r\nparticular places where the upper surface slopes backward.[129] This\r\nmay occur where the ice is pushed up over a swell in its bed, or is\r\ncrowded up against any considerable obstacle; but such cases are no\r\nmore than local exceptions, and do not militate against the truth of\r\nthe general statement that the upper surface of a glacier declines in\r\nthe direction of motion. A declining _lower_ surface is less necessary.\r\nIn the case of valley glaciers, the bed does, as a rule, decline in\r\nthe direction of motion, but that there are local exceptions is shown\r\nby the deep basins in rock which such glaciers often leave behind them\r\nwhen they retreat. In the great continental glaciers of recent geologic\r\ntimes, the ice frequently moved up slopes for scores, and even hundreds\r\nof miles; but in all such cases, the upper surface must have declined\r\nin the direction of movement. With a given thickness of ice, the\r\ngreater the decline of its lower surface in the direction of motion,\r\nthe more rapid its progress. A rough bed, or a crooked course retards\r\nthe motion of a glacier, while a smooth bottom and a straight course\r\nfacilitate it.\r\n\r\nSlope, roughness of bed, and volume affect the movement of glaciers\r\nsomewhat as they affect the movement of rivers. The temperature of\r\nthe water, on the other hand, has little effect on the flow of a\r\nriver so long as it remains unfrozen; but the effect of temperature\r\non the motion of ice is most important. In many cases, indeed, the\r\ntemperature, together with the water that is incidental to it, seems\r\nto be the chief factor in determining the rate of movement. The way in\r\nwhich its effects are felt will be discussed later.\r\n\r\n=Likenesses and unlikenesses of glaciers and rivers.=—Many of the\r\ncharacteristics of a valley glacier may be understood from the study of\r\nthe accompanying figure (Fig. 237) of the White (Alaska) glacier. From\r\nthis figure it will be seen that the glacier is an elongate river-like\r\nbody, following the curves of the valley in stream-like fashion. It\r\nhas its origin in the snows collected on the mountain heights seen\r\nin the distance, and it works its way down the valley in a manner\r\nwhich, in the aggregate, is similar to the movement of a stiff liquid.\r\nThe likeness to a river extends to many details. Not only does the\r\ncenter move faster than the sides, and the upper part faster than the\r\nbottom, as in the case of streams, but the movement is more rapid in\r\nconstricted portions of the valley and slower in the broader parts.\r\nThese and other likenesses, some of which are apparent rather than\r\nreal, have given origin to the view that glacier ice moves like a stiff\r\nviscous liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 237.—White glacier (central background) joining a\r\n  larger glacier (foreground), Alaska. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\nBut while the points of likeness between glaciers and rivers are\r\nseveral, their differences are at least equally numerous and\r\nsignificant. The trains of débris on the surface (the dark bands in the\r\nillustration), like the central currents of streams, pass nearer the\r\nprojecting points of the valley walls and farther from the receding\r\nbends; but beyond this point the analogy fails, for the trains of\r\ndébris on the ice do not conform in detail to the courses of the\r\ncurrents of a winding stream, nor is there evidence of the rotatory\r\nmotion that characterizes river water. Furthermore, the glacier is\r\nreadily fractured, as the numerous gaping crevices on many glaciers\r\nshow. The crevasses are sometimes longitudinal, sometimes transverse,\r\nand sometimes oblique. In the case of Arctic glaciers, longitudinal\r\ncrevassing is especially conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 238.—Cracking of glacier due to change in grade\r\n  of bed. A North Greenland glacier overriding a mound of\r\n  moraine-stuff.]\r\n\r\n_Crevasses_ appear to be developed wherever there is appreciable\r\ntension, and the causes of this tension are many. An obvious cause is\r\nan abrupt increase of gradient in the bed (Fig. 238). If the change\r\nof gradient be considerable, an ice-fall or cascade results, and the\r\nice may be greatly riven (Fig. 228). Below the cascade, the surface\r\nmay bristle with wedges and pinnacles of ice (séracs, Fig. 239).\r\nTransverse crevices at the margin sometimes appear to be the result\r\nof the tension developed on a curve. Oblique crevices on the surface\r\nnear the sides are commonly ascribed to the tension between the\r\nfaster-moving center and the slower-moving margins, and in like manner\r\ncrevasses that rise obliquely from the bottoms are attributed to the\r\ntension between the faster-moving portions above and the slower-moving\r\nportions below. All these crevasses indicate strains to which a liquid,\r\nwhose pressures are equal in all directions, does not offer a close\r\nanalogy. Longitudinal crevasses may affect both the river-like part\r\nof a glacier and its deploying end, and are the result of tension\r\ndeveloped by movement within the ice itself, to which, again, rivers\r\noffer no analogy. Somewhat similar cracks develop in the outer crust\r\nof asphalt, when a mass of it is allowed to stand and spread; but in\r\nthis case there is evaporation of the volatile ingredients, giving to\r\nthe outer part relative rigidity and brittleness, while the inner part\r\nremains more fluent. The analogy is therefore not perfect and probably\r\nnot really illustrative. The crevices may be narrow or wide, and both\r\nnarrow and wide may be found in the same glacier. The narrow crevices\r\nthat never open much are the most significant, as they show that very\r\nlittle stretching is needed to satisfy the tension. The opening of a\r\ngaping crevice is sometimes the work of weeks, and, in the slow-moving\r\nglaciers of high latitudes, sometimes the work of successive seasons.\r\nAll this shows that the glacier is a very brittle body, incapable of\r\nresisting even very moderate strains brought to bear upon it very\r\nslowly. Had the ice even moderate ductility, it would adapt itself to\r\ntension brought to bear upon it so slowly as are many of the tensions\r\nwhich produce crevassing. In its behavior under tension therefore a\r\nglacier is notably unlike a river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 239.—Séracs of glacier. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SURFACE FEATURES.\r\n\r\n=Topography.=—Many of the minor irregularities of the surface of a\r\nglacier are the result of crevassing. After the ice is crevassed,\r\nthe sun’s rays and the air which has been warmed by them penetrate\r\nthe openings and melt the ice. The melting is most rapid at the\r\ntop, and decreases downward. The result is that the sections of ice\r\nbetween adjacent crevasses are narrowed into wedges. If there be\r\ncross-crevassing, as is common, points instead of wedges result. As the\r\nsort of surface shown in Fig. 239 develops, any débris which was on the\r\nice slides into the crevices, and the upper surface becomes clean.\r\n\r\nWhere ice is crevassed transversely, and where melting is not rapid,\r\nthe crevasses may close as the ice moves forward, and the regelation\r\nof adjoining faces heals the rents in the surface. Even in this case,\r\nhowever, the surface is likely to be more or less undulating because of\r\nthe waste on the sides of the crevices before they are closed. After\r\nregelation, surface ablation tends to obliterate the protuberances.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the surface of the ice is affected by other\r\nconditions. All parts of the surface of the ice are not equally\r\ncompact, and the least compact portions melt most rapidly, giving rise\r\nto depressions, while the more solid parts occasion protuberances.\r\nBoth depressions and protuberances may be regular or irregular in form\r\n(Figs. 240 and 241). Undulations of the bed often show themselves\r\nin the surface of the ice as suggested by Fig. 242. In such cases,\r\nponds or lakelets sometimes accumulate on the surface of the ice. The\r\ntopography of the ice in such cases seems to show that the ice is\r\nforced up slope.\r\n\r\n=Surface moraines.=—The surface of a glacier is often affected by\r\ndébris of one sort or another, and this also influences its topography.\r\nThe débris is sometimes disposed in the form of belts or _moraines_\r\n(Figs. 237, 243). The surface moraines may be _lateral_, _medial_,\r\nor _terminal_. A _lateral moraine_ is any considerable accumulation\r\nof débris in a belt on the side of a glacier. A _medial moraine_ is\r\na similar accumulation at some distance from the margins, but not\r\nnecessarily in or near the middle. There may be several medial\r\nmoraines on one glacier, in which case some of them may be far from\r\nthe center. In alpine glaciers, the _surface terminal_ moraine is less\r\nwell-defined; in polar glaciers it often connects two lateral moraines,\r\nmaking a loop roughly concentric with the terminus of the glacier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 240.—End of Mount Dana glacier, Cal. Shows\r\n  irregularities of surface due to crevassing farther up the glacier,\r\n  and to unequal melting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 241.—Shows irregularities due to unequal melting\r\n  of veined ice. End of small glacier south of Forno hut, Engadine,\r\n  Switzerland. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the surface moraines, which represent belted aggregations of\r\ndébris, there may be scattered bowlders and bits of rock of various\r\nsizes on the ice, and, in addition to the coarse material, there is\r\noften some dust which has been blown upon the ice.\r\n\r\n=Relief due to surface débris.=—The débris on the ice affects its\r\ntopography by influencing the melting of the subjacent and adjacent\r\nice. The rock débris absorbs heat more readily than the ice. A small\r\nand thin piece of stone lying on the ice is warmed through by the\r\nsun’s rays, and, melting the ice beneath, sinks, just as a piece of\r\nblack cloth on snow will sink because of the increased melting beneath\r\nit. Though a good absorber of heat, rock is a poor conductor, and so\r\nthe lower surface of a large mass of stone is not notably warmed. The\r\nice beneath it is protected from the direct rays of the sun, and is\r\ntherefore melted more slowly than that around it. The result is that\r\nthe bowlder presently stands on a protuberance of ice (Fig. 244). When\r\nits pedestal becomes high, the oblique rays of the sun and the warm air\r\nsurrounding it cause it to waste away, and the capping bowlder falls.\r\nIn high latitudes, the great obliquity of the rays sometimes allows\r\nthem to strike under isolated bowlders. In this case, they are warmed\r\nfrom below, and thus aid rather than hinder the melting of the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 242.—Irregular surface due to uneven bottom.\r\nBowdoin glacier, Inglefield Gulf, North Greenland. The dark patches\r\nnear the left margin of the glacier are lakelets in basins produced by\r\nthe upward bending of the ice as it overrides an elevation in its bed.\r\nThe figure also shows a depressed medial moraine.]\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to the moraines. A thin bowlder moraine in\r\nhigh latitudes is sometimes sunk below the surface (Fig. 242). Usually,\r\nhowever, a medial moraine protects the ice beneath from melting, and\r\noccasions the development of a ridge of ice beneath itself. As the ice\r\non either side is then lowered by ablation, the moraine matter of the\r\nmedial belt tends to slide down on either hand. The same is true of the\r\nlateral moraines. So far does this spreading go, that in some cases the\r\nlower end of a glacier is completely covered with the débris which has\r\nspread from the medial and lateral moraines. Examples of this may be\r\nseen in almost any region of abundant, long, alpine glaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 243.—A Swiss glacier, showing surface moraines,\r\n  characteristic profile, etc.]\r\n\r\n=Dust-wells.=—The wind-blown dust sometimes gives rise to peculiar\r\ntopographic features of small size. The dust is not distributed by the\r\nwind with absolute equality, and the surface drainage of the ice tends\r\nto aggregate it. Every dust particle acts like a small stone, and where\r\naggregations of dust occur, they melt their way down into the ice,\r\ndeveloping holes or “dust-wells” (Fig. 245). These wells rarely reach a\r\ndepth of more than a few inches, but they may be so numerous that the\r\npedestrian is obliged to watch his steps. This is especially true near\r\nthe edge of the large ice-caps. It is evident that the depth of these\r\ndust wells must be slight, for so soon as they are deep enough to cut\r\noff the sun’s rays from the dust at the bottom, the deepening ceases.\r\nOther things being equal, they are deeper in low latitudes than in high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 244.—Bowlder on ice pinnacle.

Southeast side of McCormick Bay, North\r\n  Greenland.]\r\n\r\n=Débris below the surface.=—The lower part of a glacier, as well as\r\nthe upper, carries rock débris. This débris is sometimes so abundant,\r\nespecially near the ends and edges of the ice, that it is difficult to\r\nlocate the bottom of the glacier; for between the moving ice which is\r\nfull of débris, and the stationary débris which is full of ice, there\r\nseems to be a nearly complete gradation. The débris in the lower part\r\nof arctic glaciers, and to some extent of others, is often disposed in\r\nthin sheets sandwiched in between layers of clean ice. These débris\r\nsheets are often numerous and usually discontinuous, though groups\r\nof such sheets often persist for considerable distances. Débris also\r\noccurs to some extent in the ice well above its base. It is sometimes\r\nin belts, as seen in section, and sometimes in bunches. These various\r\nrelations are illustrated by Figs. 227, 229, and 246–249.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the basal débris-laden part of some glaciers\r\nis the _foliation of the ice_ (Figs. 248, 249, etc.). This is\r\nespecially well shown in the arctic glaciers, the ends and sides of\r\nwhich have steep or vertical faces. The foliation is best developed\r\nin the débris zone, though often shown above. The foliation is\r\nsometimes minute, consisting of layers of clean ice, an inch or less\r\nin thickness, separated by mere films of earthy matter. In extreme\r\ncases there are a score or more of laminæ within a foot. Locally, and\r\nespecially where débris is abundant, the laminæ are much contorted.\r\nThis is seen both in section (Figs. 248 and 249) and on the surface\r\n(Fig. 250).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   TEMPERATURE, WASTE, AND DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of glacier ice may range downward from the freezing\r\npoint of water much as other solid portions of the earth’s surface,\r\nbut it has a fixed upper limit at 32° Fahr. (0° C.) because all the\r\nheat it receives tending to raise its temperature above that point, is\r\nconverted into the latent form by the melting of the ice. The range of\r\ntemperature is greatest at the surface, where it varies from 32° in the\r\nsummer, to the coldest temperature of the region where the ice occurs.\r\nBeneath the surface the range of temperature is more restricted, and\r\nincreasingly so with increasing depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 248.—Side view of end of glacier. Southeast side\r\n  of McCormick Bay, North Greenland. Shows structure of ice as well as\r\n  position of débris.]\r\n\r\nThe variation of temperature at the surface is due primarily to the\r\nvarying temperature of the air. During the cold season, a wave of low\r\ntemperature (the _winter_ wave), starting at the surface, penetrates\r\nthe ice, and during the warm season a wave of higher temperature (the\r\n_summer_ wave) takes the same course. The day and night waves and other\r\nminor variables are, for present purposes, negligible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 249.—Side view of a North Greenland glacier (East\r\n  glacier), showing position of débris and structure of the ice.]\r\n\r\n=The winter wave.=—There are but few observations on the internal\r\ntemperatures of glaciers during the winter season, but it seems certain\r\nthat the winter wave diminishes rapidly downward and dies out below,\r\nmuch as does the winter wave which affects land surfaces not covered\r\nwith ice. Conduction alone considered, the temperature of the ice where\r\nthe cold wave dies out, should correspond, approximately, to the mean\r\nannual temperature of the region, provided that temperature is below\r\nthe melting point of ice.\r\n\r\nAssuming that in the high altitudes and high latitudes where glaciers\r\nabound, the temperature of the surface may average about -12° Fahr.\r\n(about -25° C.) for the winter half of the year, which is about the\r\ncase for north Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Franz Josef Land, and that\r\nthe conductivity of the ice in the C. G. S.[130] system is .005,\r\nthe temperature would be lowered appreciably only about 40 feet\r\nbelow the surface at the close of the winter period, conduction only\r\nbeing considered. How far the internal temperature may be influenced\r\nby air forced through the ice by winds and by variations of the\r\nbarometer is not known and cannot well be estimated. The wave of low\r\ntemperature descending from the surface in winter would probably become\r\ninappreciable before reaching a depth of 60 feet. At this depth the\r\ntemperature should be about 15° Fahr.—the mean annual temperature of\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 250.—Contorted lamination shown at the surface. A\r\n  small glacier south of Forno hut, Engadine, Switzerland. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n=The summer wave.=—The warm wave follows the analogy of the summer wave\r\nof ice-free land surfaces much less closely. This is because of the\r\nlow melting temperature of ice as compared with other forms of solid\r\nearth-matter. On this account the summer wave is bi-fold. The one part\r\ntravels downward by conduction, the other by the descent of water; the\r\none has to do primarily with the temperature before the melting-point\r\nof ice is reached; the other, with the temperature after that point\r\nis reached; the first conforms measurably to the warm wave affecting\r\nother solid earth-matter, while the second is governed by special\r\nlaws. After the surface portion of the ice is brought to the melting\r\ntemperature, the additional heat which it receives melts the ice and\r\nis transformed from _sensible_ into _potential_ heat. Ice charged with\r\nwater is _potentially_, but not _sensibly_, warmer than ice which has\r\njust reached the melting temperature.\r\n\r\nThe warm wave of conduction dies out below like the cold wave. The\r\nwarm wave descending by the flow of water stops where the freezing\r\ntemperature of water is reached. In regions where the average\r\ntemperature is below freezing, the water-wave does not descend so far\r\nas the wave of conduction, since the latter descends below the zone\r\nwhere the melting temperature is found.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations warrant the generalization that glaciers\r\nnormally consist of two zones (1) an outer or upper zone of fluctuating\r\ntemperature, and (2) an under zone of nearly constant temperature. The\r\nunder zone obviously does not exist where the thickness of the ice is\r\nless than the thickness of the zone of fluctuating temperature. This\r\nmay be the case in very thin glaciers in very cold regions, and in the\r\nthin ends and edges of all glaciers.\r\n\r\n=The temperature of the bottom.=—The internal heat of the earth is\r\nslowly conducted to the base of a glacier where it melts the ice at\r\nthe estimated average rate of about one-fourth of an inch per year.\r\nThe temperature of melting is a little below 32° Fahr. since pressure\r\nlowers the melting-point at the rate of .0133° Fahr. (.0075° C.) for\r\none atmosphere of pressure. At the bottom of a mile of ice therefore\r\nthe melting temperature is about 30.2° Fahr. (-1° C.) It is probable\r\nthat in all thick glaciers the temperature of the bottom is constantly\r\nmaintained at the melting-point. This may be indicated by the streams\r\nwhich issue from beneath glaciers during the winter, though this\r\ncriterion is hardly decisive since the issuing waters may be derived\r\npartly or wholly from the rock beneath. In glaciers or in parts of\r\nglaciers so thin as to lie wholly within the zone of fluctuating\r\ntemperature, the temperature of the bottom is obviously not constant.\r\n\r\n=Temperature of the interior of the ice.=—The variation of temperature\r\nof the surface of a glacier has already been shown to lie between a\r\nmaximum of 32° Fahr. and the minimum temperature of the region where\r\nthe glacier occurs. Lower, in the zone of fluctuating temperature, the\r\nvariation is less, and where the zone of fluctuating temperature passes\r\ninto the zone of constant temperature, variation ceases. The thickness\r\nof the zone of fluctuating temperature varies with the temperature of\r\nthe region where the glacier occurs, being greatest where the winters\r\nare coldest. In the case of all glaciers except thin ones in very cold\r\nregions, the temperatures within the zone of constant temperature range\r\nfrom the mean annual temperature of the region at the top of the zone\r\n(provided this is not above the melting-point of ice at this depth) to\r\nthe melting temperature of the ice at the bottom. Within these limits\r\nthe range may be great or slight.\r\n\r\nIf we consider only the effects of the external seasonal temperatures\r\nand the internal heat of the earth, it appears that all the ice in\r\nthe zone of constant temperature in the lower end of a typical alpine\r\nglacier should have a constant melting temperature, for the average\r\ntemperature of regions where the ends of such glaciers occur is usually\r\nabove 32° Fahr., and this determines a temperature of 32° Fahr. (or a\r\nlittle less) at the top of the zone, while a melting temperature is\r\nmaintained at the bottom by the earth’s interior heat. In thin glaciers\r\nof very cold regions, where the zone of constant temperature has\r\nrelatively slight thickness, the low temperature descending from the\r\nsurface may so far overcome the effect of internal heat as to keep the\r\nbottom of the ice at a freezing temperature. In all other cases, the\r\nice at the bottom of the under zone has a melting temperature, while\r\nthat above is probably colder.\r\n\r\nIn the higher altitudes and in the polar latitudes where glaciers\r\nare chiefly generated, the mean annual temperature of the surface is\r\nusually below the melting-point of ice. Here the temperature of the\r\nice between the top and bottom of the zone of constant temperature\r\nmust, on the average, be below the melting-point, unless heat enough\r\nis generated in the interior of the ice to offset the effect of the\r\ntemperature above. For example, where the mean annual temperature is\r\n20° Fahr. or lower, as in middle Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Franz\r\nJosef Land, and at certain high altitudes in more southerly latitudes,\r\nthe mean temperature in the zone of constant temperature should range\r\nfrom 20° Fahr. at the top to 32° Fahr. (or a little less) below;\r\ni.e., it should average about 6° below the melting-point. Under these\r\nconditions, all the ice in the zone of constant temperature, except\r\nthat at its bottom, must be permanently below the melting-point, but it\r\nis perhaps worthy of especial note that much of it is but little below.\r\nIn alpine glaciers the part of the ice affected by this constant low\r\ntemperature (below freezing) is presumed to be chiefly that which lies\r\nbeneath the snow-fields. In polar glaciers the low temperature probably\r\nprevails beneath the surface, not only throughout the great ice-caps,\r\nbut also in the marginal glaciers which descend from them.\r\n\r\nFrom these theoretical considerations we may deduce the generalization\r\nthat in the zone of constant temperature _within the area of glacial\r\ngrowth_, the temperature of the ice is generally _below_ the\r\nmelting-point, while _within the area of wastage_, the temperature of\r\nthe corresponding zone is generally _at_ the melting-point.\r\n\r\n=Compression and friction as causes of heat.=—The foregoing conclusions\r\nare somewhat modified by dynamic sources of heat. The compression\r\narising from gravity, and the friction developed where there is motion,\r\nare causes of heat. Since friction occurs only when motion takes place,\r\nthe heat which it generates is secondary and may, for present purposes,\r\nbe neglected. Compression not only lowers the melting-point slightly,\r\nbut it _produces heat at the point of compression_. Where the ice is\r\ngranular, the compression, due to weight, takes place at the contacts\r\nof the grains. At intermediate points the pressure tends to cause\r\nthem to bulge, and this has the effect of lowering the temperature\r\nof the bulging points. If therefore the compression be considerable,\r\nthe granules may be warmed to the melting-point where they press each\r\nother, while at other points their temperature may be lower. In this\r\ncase melting will take place at the points of compression, and the\r\nmoisture so produced will be transferred to the adjacent parts of the\r\ngranule and immediately refrozen. Melting at the points of compression\r\nwould result in some yielding of the mass, and in some shifting of\r\nthe pressure to new points where compression and melting would again\r\ntake place. Thus the melting, the refreezing, and the attendant\r\nmovement might go on until the limits of the power of gravity in this\r\ndirection were reached. From considerations already adduced, it appears\r\nthat the temperature in some parts of every considerable body of ice\r\nmust be such as to permit these changes. The heat due to depression\r\nand friction may modify the theoretical deductions drawn above from\r\natmospheric and internal influences.\r\n\r\n=Summary.=—If the foregoing generalizations be correct, (1) the\r\nsurface of a glacier is likely to be melted during the summer, (2) its\r\nimmediate bottom is slowly melting all the time (unless the thickness\r\nof the ice be less than the thickness of the zone of annual variation\r\nor of permanent freezing temperature); (3) its subsurface portion _in\r\nthe zone of waste_ is generally melting, owing to descending water,\r\ncompression, and friction; while (4) its subsurface portion _in the\r\nzone of growth_ is probably below the melting-point except as locally\r\nbrought to that temperature by compression, friction, and descending\r\nwater, and at the bottom by conduction from the rock beneath.\r\n\r\n=Movement under low temperature.=—Glacier motion will not be discussed\r\nat this point, but one of the bearings of the preceding conclusions\r\non glacier motion may be pointed out. Since there must be motion\r\nin the area of growth to supply the loss in the area of waste, the\r\n_fundamental_ cause of motion must be operative in bodies of ice the\r\nmean temperature of which is below the melting-point, _unless the\r\ndynamic sources of heat are considerable_. This fundamental cause does\r\nnot exclude the _coöperation_ of causes that work only (1) at the\r\nmelting temperature, or (2) where the ice is bathed with water, or (3)\r\nin the plane of contact between wet ice above and dry ice below. These\r\nmay be _auxiliary_ causes which abet the fundamental one in producing\r\nthe more rapid movement of warm seasons, or in bringing about the\r\nespecially rapid movement in situations where there is abundant water,\r\nor in inducing the shearing which is such a remarkable feature of\r\narctic glaciers.\r\n\r\n=Evaporation.=—The ice wastes by evaporation as well as by melting, and\r\nwhile the former process is far less important than the latter, its\r\nresults are probably larger than is commonly apprehended. One of the\r\nmost remarkable features of some of the deposits of ancient glaciers is\r\nthe slight evidence they afford of escaping waters. The most plausible\r\nexplanation seems to lie in the supposition that the ice was largely\r\nwasted by evaporation. This conclusion finds support in many places\r\nin the presence of a mantle of fine silt over the drift, the silt\r\nbeing apparently composed of dust blown upon the ice. It is supposed\r\nto imply aridity in the region about the ice. If a sufficient mantle\r\nof dust were spread over the border zone of the ice, and if the air\r\nwere very dry, nearly all the water melted on the surface of the ice\r\nmight be held back by the dust-wells until the water was evaporated or\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 251.—Spouting stream. Glacier south side of\r\n  Olriks Bay, North Greenland.]\r\n\r\n=Drainage.=—Some of the water produced by surface melting forms little\r\nstreams on the ice. Sooner or later they plunge into crevasses or over\r\nthe sides and ends of the glacier. In the former case, they may melt\r\nor wear out well-like passages (moulins) in the ice, and even in the\r\nrock beneath. Much of the surface water sinks into the ice. Its ready\r\npenetration is aided by the “dust-wells” which mark the surface of\r\nmany glaciers. In north Greenland wells which contain six or eight\r\ninches of water at the end of a warm day are often dry in the morning.\r\nThe water has leaked out and passed to lower levels. From these and\r\nother harmonious observations it is inferred that the superficial\r\npart of a glacier at least is readily penetrated by water. The depth\r\nto which surface water penetrates is undetermined, but it doubtless\r\nvaries greatly, not only in different glaciers, but in different parts\r\nof the same glacier, and in the same part at different times. Above\r\nthe line of perennial snow there is little water either from melting\r\nor from rain, and hence relatively slight penetration. Below the line\r\nof perennial snow there is much melting and much rain, and here it is\r\nprobable that the water sometimes, perhaps usually, penetrates to the\r\nbottom of the ice during the melting season, even independently of\r\ncrevasses.\r\n\r\nOnce within the glacier, the course of the water is variable.\r\nExceptionally it follows definite englacial channels, as shown by\r\nsprings or streams issuing from the ice at some point above its bottom\r\n(Fig. 251). Oftener it descends or moves forward through the irregular\r\nopenings which the accidents of motion have developed. If it reaches a\r\nlevel where the temperature is below its freezing-point, it congeals.\r\nOtherwise it remains in cavities or descends to the bottom. The water\r\nproduced by melting within the glacier probably follows a similar\r\ncourse. So far as these waters descend to the bottom, they join those\r\nproduced by basal melting and issue from the glacier with them. In\r\nalpine glaciers the waters beneath the ice often unite in a common\r\nstream in the axis of the valley, and hollow out a tunnel. Thus the\r\nRhone is already a considerable stream where it issues from beneath the\r\nRhone glacier. In the glaciers of high latitudes, subglacial tunnels\r\nare less common and the drainage is in streams along the sides of the\r\nglaciers or through the débris beneath and about them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the glacier, all waters, whether they have been\r\nsuperglacial, englacial or subglacial, unite to bear away the silt,\r\nsand, gravel, and even small bowlders set free from the ice, and\r\nto spread them in belts along the border of the ice or in trains\r\nstretching down the valleys below. These are the most common of the\r\nglacio-fluvial deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE WORK OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n                     _Erosion and transportation._\r\n\r\nThe work accomplished by glaciers is distinctive, for while like\r\nrivers, they abrade the valleys through which they pass, carry forward\r\nthe material which they remove from the surface, and wear, grind, and\r\nultimately deposit it, and while their work therefore includes erosion,\r\ntransportation, and deposition, their method is peculiar.\r\n\r\n=Getting load.=—If the surface on which the snow-field which is to\r\nbecome a glacier accumulates be rough and covered with abundant rock\r\ndébris, as such surfaces usually are, the glacier already has a basal\r\nload when its movement begins, for the snow covers, surrounds, and\r\nincludes such loose blocks of rock as project above the general surface\r\nand envelops all projecting points of rock within its field. When the\r\nsnow becomes ice and the ice begins to move, it carries forward the\r\nloose rock already imbedded in it, and tears off the weak points of\r\nthe enveloped rock-projections. It may perhaps also move some of the\r\nsoil and mantle rock of the original surface to which it is frozen. In\r\naddition to the _subglacial_ load which the glacier thus has at the\r\noutset, there may be a surface load which has fallen on the snow or ice\r\nfrom cliffs above. This is especially true of mountain-valley glaciers.\r\nIf this has been buried by snow and ice it is _englacial_; if it lies\r\non the surface it is _superglacial_.\r\n\r\nOnce in movement, the ice carries away the débris to which it was\r\noriginally attached, and at the same time gathers new load from the\r\nsame area. The new load is acquired partly by the rasping effect of the\r\nrock-shod ice on its bed, and partly by its rending power which, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, may quarry out considerable blocks of rock.\r\nThis “plucking” process is at its best where the ice passes over cliffs\r\nof jointed rock or steep-sloped hills.\r\n\r\nAs the ice advances into new territory it acquires additional basal\r\nload, partly by rasping, partly by plucking, partly by freezing to\r\nit, and partly in other ways. One of these ways may be illustrated by\r\nthe sequence of events when the end of a glacier advances on a very\r\nlarge bowlder. As the ice approaches it, the reflection of heat from\r\nit melts the adjacent edge of the ice, making a slight reëntrant. With\r\nfarther advance, the ice closes in against and around the bowlder, and\r\nfinally carries it along in the bottom of the moving mass. In some\r\ncases, especially when its advance is rapid, the ice may push débris in\r\nfront of itself. Even where this is the case, the amount of material\r\npushed forward is generally slight, partly because the extreme edge of\r\nthe ice often fails to rest on the land in summer, when the movement\r\nis greatest, being melted from below by the heat of the surface over\r\nwhich it is spreading (see Fig. 252), and partly because the earth in\r\nfront of the glacier is frozen during a large part of the year. In this\r\ncondition, the earthy matter has greater resistance than the ice,\r\nand the latter rides over it. Superglacial material may be acquired\r\nduring movement by the fall of débris from cliffs, or by the descent of\r\navalanches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 252.—Diagram showing lack of contact of the edge\r\n  of the ice with its bed.]\r\n\r\n=Conditions influencing rate of erosion.=—An obstructive attitude\r\nof the surface toward the movement of the ice is as necessary for\r\neffective erosion as the movement of the ice itself. Advancing over a\r\nflat surface, ice ordinarily inflicts but little wear, since there is\r\nlittle for it to get hold of. So slight is the abrasive power of ice\r\nunder these conditions that it frequently overrides and buries the soil\r\nwith more or less of its herbaceous vegetation. But while a certain\r\nmeasure of roughness of surface is favorable for glacial erosion, the\r\ntopography may be so uneven as to seriously impede the ice. Erosion\r\nis probably at its maximum, so far as influenced by topography, when\r\nthe roughness of the surface is such as to offer notable catchment for\r\nthe basal ice, but not such as to impede its motion very seriously.\r\nThe amount of relief favorable for the greatest erosion increases with\r\nincreasing thickness of the ice.\r\n\r\nOther conditions which influence erosion by ice are (1) the amount of\r\nloose or slightly attached débris on the surface, (2) the resistance of\r\nthe rock, (3) the slope of the surface, (4) the thickness of the ice,\r\n(5) the rate of movement, and (6) the abundance and character of the\r\ndébris which the ice has to work with. The effect of the first five of\r\nthese conditions is evident. The effect of the last is less simple.\r\nClean ice passing over a smooth surface of solid rock has little effect\r\nupon it; but a rock-shod glacier will abrade the same surface notably.\r\nThe effect of this abrasion is shown in the grooves and scratches\r\n(_striæ_) which the stones in the bottom of the ice inflict on the\r\nsurface of the rock over which they pass (Figs. 253, 255, and 256).\r\nAt the same time the stones in the ice are themselves worn both by\r\nabrasion with the bottom, and with one another (Fig. 254). It does not\r\nfollow, however, that the more material in the bottom of the ice the\r\ngreater the erosion it effects; for with increase of débris there may\r\nbe decrease of motion[131] and, beyond a certain point, the decrease\r\nof motion seriously interferes with the efficiency of erosion. When any\r\nconsiderable thickness of ice at the bottom of the glacier is full of\r\ndébris, this loaded basal portion may approach stagnancy, and the lower\r\nlimit of considerable movement may lie between the loaded ice below\r\nand the relatively clean ice above. A moderate, but not an excessive\r\nload of débris is, therefore, favorable for great erosion. Something\r\ndepends, too, on the character of the load. Coarse, hard, and angular\r\ndébris is a more effective instrument of erosion than fine, soft, or\r\nrounded material. The adverse influence of the overloading of the ice\r\non its motion has been likened to the stiffening of a viscous liquid by\r\nthe addition of foreign matter, but it may better perhaps be referred\r\nto the destruction of the granular-crystalline continuity on which\r\nglacier motion probably depends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 253.—Glacial striæ and bruises.

Surv.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding statement, it is evident that erosion is not equally\r\neffective at all points beneath a glacier. So far as concerns the ice\r\nitself, erosion is not most effective at the end of a valley glacier,\r\nor at the edge of an ice sheet, for here the strength of movement is\r\ntoo slight and the load too great; nor is the most effective erosion\r\nat the source or near it, for though the ice may here be thick, the\r\nmovement is slow and the load likely to be slight. Ice conditions only\r\nbeing considered, erosion is most effective somewhere between the\r\nsource and the terminus, and probably much nearer the latter than the\r\nformer. The conditions of the surface over which the ice passes may\r\nbe such as to vary the place of greatest erosion widely. Thus in an\r\nAlpine glacier, erosion may be most effective at the _Bergschrund_\r\nbecause the slope here favors “plucking.” Here, notable amphitheatres\r\n(_cirques_) are sometimes excavated. After the glacier disappears,\r\nthe bottom of the cirque is often seen to contain rock basins (Fig.\r\n257). Glacial cirques abound in mountains where glaciers once existed,\r\nbut from which they have now disappeared. The cirques of the Bighorn\r\nmountains of Wyoming (Pl. XIX) are examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 256.—Striæ, grooves, etc., in a canyon tributary\r\n  to Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Mountains. (Church.)]\r\n\r\n=Summary.=—In summary it may be said that rapidly moving ice of\r\nsufficient thickness to be working under goodly pressure, shod with\r\na sufficient but not excessive quantity of hard-rock material,\r\npassing over incoherent or soft formations possessing a topography\r\nof sufficient relief to offer some resistance, and yet too little to\r\nretard seriously the progress of the ice, will erode most effectively.\r\n\r\n=Varied nature of glacial débris.=—From its mode of erosion it will\r\nreadily be seen that the bottom of a glacier may be charged with\r\nvarious sorts of material. There may be (1) bowlders which the ice has\r\npicked up from the surface, or which it has broken off from projecting\r\npoints of rock over which it has passed; (2) smaller pieces of rock\r\nof the size of cobbles, pebbles, etc., either picked up by the ice\r\nfrom its bed or broken off from larger masses; (3) the fine products\r\n(rock-flour) produced by the grinding of the débris in the ice on the\r\nrock-bed over which it passes, and similar products resulting from the\r\nrubbing of stones in the ice against one another; and (4) sand, clay,\r\nsoil, vegetation, etc., derived from the surface overridden. Thus\r\nthe materials which the ice carries (_drift_) are of all grades of\r\ncoarseness and fineness, from large bowlders to fine clay. The coarser\r\nmaterial may be angular or round at the outset, and its form may be\r\nchanged and its surface striated as it is moved forward. Whether one\r\nsort of material or another predominates, depends primarily on the\r\nnature of the surface overridden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\n  PART OF THE BIGHORN MOUNTAIN RANGE, WYOMING.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\n  A SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 257.—A glacial cirque. The lake occupies a rock\r\n  basin, produced by glacier erosion. Head of Little Timber Creek,\r\n  Montana.]\r\n\r\n=The topographic effects of glacial erosion.=—In passing through its\r\nvalley, an alpine glacier deepens and widens its bottom and smooths\r\nits slopes up to the upper limit of the ice. It tends to change a\r\nV-shaped valley (Fig. 258) into a U-shaped one (Fig. 259). The change\r\nin topography at the upper limit of glaciation is often marked (Figs.\r\n260 and 261).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 258.—The Valley of the American Fork. A V-shaped\r\n  non-glaciated valley in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. Compare Fig.\r\n  259. (Church.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 259.—U-shaped valley resulting from glaciation.\r\n  Little Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Mountains. (Church.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 260.—Contrast between glaciated topography below\r\n  and non-glaciated topography above.

Needles Mountains, from slope\r\n  west of Hidden Lake. (Cross, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe deepening of a valley by glacial erosion may throw its tributaries\r\nout of topographic adjustment. Thus if a main valley is lowered 100\r\nfeet by glacial erosion while its tributary is not deepened, the\r\nlower end of the latter will be 100 feet above the former when the\r\nice disappears. Such a valley is called a _hanging valley_ (Figs. 262\r\nand 263). Such valleys are of common occurrence in regions recently\r\nglaciated, but now ice-free. Examples are common in the western\r\nmountains of North America and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIce-caps which overspread the surface irrespective of valleys and\r\nhills, tend to reduce the angularities of the surface. Hills and ridges\r\nare cut down and smoothed (Figs. 264 and 265); but since valleys\r\nparallel to the direction of movement are deepened at the same time,\r\nit is doubtful if the relief of the surface is commonly reduced by the\r\nerosion of an ice-cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 262.—A hanging valley. East side of Lake\r\n  Kootenai, B. C. All except the highest summits glaciated. (Atwood.)]\r\n\r\n=Fiords.=—A glacier descending into the head of a narrow bay may gouge\r\nout the bay to a very considerable depth, causing its head to recede.\r\nWhen the ice finally melts, the bay may be a fiord. Thus have arisen\r\nthe glacial features of many of the fiords of high-latitude coasts, and\r\nmany of the glaciers of those coasts are now making fiords (Fig. 266).\r\nFiords also arise in other ways. Coasts indented by fiords are likely\r\nto be bordered by islands.\r\n\r\n=The positions in which débris is carried.=—As a result of the methods\r\nby which a glacier becomes loaded, there are three positions in which\r\nthe débris is carried: (1) the basal or subglacial, (2) the englacial,\r\nand (3) the superglacial. The material picked up or rubbed off from\r\nthe surface over which the ice moves is normally carried forward in\r\nthe base of the ice; while that which falls on the surface is usually\r\ncarried in the form of surface moraines. In the former position the\r\ndrift is basal; in the latter, superglacial. It is doubtful if much\r\ndébris is moved along beneath (that is, strictly below the bottom of)\r\nthe ice, though the movement of the latter would have a tendency to\r\ndrag or urge along with it the loose material of its bed. If drift were\r\ncarried forward in such positions, it would be strictly _subglacial_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 263.—A hanging valley. The water falls (Bridal\r\n  Veil) from a hanging valley. (Wineman.)]\r\n\r\nThe basal load of a glacier is constantly being mixed with new\r\naccessions derived from ground over which the ice is passing, and\r\nthis admixture tells the story of the work done by the bottom of the\r\nice. The englacial and superglacial material, on the other hand, is\r\nnormally borne from the place of origin to the place of deposition\r\nwithout such intermixture. It is a case of “local” versus “through”\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n=Transfers of load.=—While the origin of the load usually determines\r\nits position, exceptions and complications arise from the transfer\r\nof load from one position to another, and from the gradation of one\r\nhorizon into another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 264.—A non-glaciated hill. Dalrymple Island.\r\n  North Greenland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 265.—A glaciated hill. Southeastern Carey Island.\r\n  About 30 miles west-northwest of Dalrymple Island.]\r\n\r\nMost of the débris gathered by ice is acquired at its bottom. While\r\nsuch material is basal _at the outset_, some of it may find itself\r\nabove the bottom a little later. Thus when ice passes over a hill (Fig.\r\n267) the bottom of the ice rends débris from the top of the hill. When\r\nit descends from one level to another there is a similar result (Fig.\r\n268). To the lee of the hill the ice from either side may close in\r\nunder that which came over the top, in which case the débris derived\r\nfrom the top of the hill by the bottom of the overriding ice will be\r\nwell up in the ice. It has passed from an initial basal to a subsequent\r\nenglacial position. The change does not usually involve an actual rise\r\nof the material, but rather a decline. If carried upward at all, the\r\nupward movement is temporary only, and incident to the passage of the\r\nice over the hill, or to other local causes. The englacial débris may\r\nbe little or much above the basal zone according to the height of the\r\nelevation overridden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 266.—Alaskan fiords. The shaded areas represent\r\n  land. (From charts of the C. & G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 267.—Diagram to illustrate the taking of débris\r\n  from a hill-top. It also illustrates how englacial débris may become\r\n  superglacial as the result of surface ablation.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 268.—Taking débris from a protuberance of the\r\n  bed.]\r\n\r\nSuperglacial débris may obviously become englacial by falling into\r\ncrevasses or by being carried down by descending waters. Either\r\nsuperglacial or englacial débris may become basal by the same means.\r\n\r\nFrom their form and position, there is less ice-free land in immediate\r\nassociation with ice-caps than with valley glaciers. Furthermore, the\r\nice-free land about the borders of an ice-cap is less likely to be in\r\nthe form of cliffs above it. As a result, the surfaces of ice-caps are\r\ncomparatively clean, except at their edges where the ice is thin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 269.—Side view of end of a glacier on the south\r\n  side of Olriks Bay, North Greenland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 270.—Closer view of a part of the ice shown in\r\n  Fig. 269.]\r\n\r\nEnglacial material may become superglacial by surface ablation. In this\r\ncase the drift does not rise, but melting brings the surface of the ice\r\ndown to its level. This occurs chiefly at the end or edge of the ice,\r\nwhere the surface melting is greatest. Englacial débris, especially\r\nthat near the bottom, may also become basal by the melting of the\r\nbottom of the ice.\r\n\r\nEnglacial material plucked or rasped from an elevation over which the\r\nice has passed is liable to be disposed in a longitudinal belt in\r\nthe ice in the lee of the elevation itself. By surface ablation this\r\nmaterial may reach the surface at some point below its source, and\r\nbe disposed as a medial moraine. Such a moraine has an origin very\r\ndifferent from that of a medial moraine formed by the junction of two\r\nlateral moraines of superglacial origin.\r\n\r\nMuch less in the natural order of things is the transfer of material\r\nfrom a basal to an englacial and from an englacial to a superglacial\r\nposition by upward movement of the débris itself. Such transfer is\r\nremarkable because the specific gravity of rock is from two and a half\r\nto three times as great as that of ice, so that its normal tendency is\r\nto sink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 271.—Surface terminal moraines due to upturning.\r\n  Edge of the ice-sheet, North Greenland.]\r\n\r\nIn arctic glaciers, and probably in others, some material which has\r\nbeen basal becomes englacial by being sheared forward over ice in front\r\nof it. So far as observed this takes place chiefly where the ice in\r\nfront of the plane of shearing lies at a lower level than that behind,\r\nas where the surface of an upland falls off into a valley, or where\r\na boss of rock shelters the ice in its lee from the thrust of the\r\noverriding ice (Fig. 268).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 272.—Diagram illustrating the upturning of the\r\nlayers of ice at the end of an arctic glacier as seen in end-section.\r\nThe bottom line represents sea level.]\r\n\r\nAt the borders of arctic glaciers the lower layers are not infrequently\r\nupturned, as shown in Figs. 269 to 272. Where the layers turn up at\r\nthe end of a glacier (Figs. 269 and 270), basal and englacial débris\r\nis carried to the surface by actual upward movement, and a terminal\r\nmoraine or a series of terminal moraines sometimes aggregated _where\r\nthe upturned layers of ice outcrop at the surface_ (Fig. 271). That\r\nthe material of these moraines was originally basal is abundantly\r\ndemonstrated by the bruised and scratched condition of the bowlders\r\nand pebbles, and sometimes by the nature of the material itself. For\r\nexample, in two cases in North Greenland where glaciers descend into\r\nthe heads of shallow bays and move forward on their bottoms, moraines\r\nformed by the upturning of the layers were seen to contain _abundant\r\nmolluscan shells derived from the bottom of the bay_. The upturning\r\nsometimes affects the side-edges of ice-tongues (Fig. 272) as well as\r\ntheir ends, and the material thus brought to the surface gives origin\r\nto lateral moraines altogether different in origin from the lateral\r\nmoraines formed by the falling of débris upon the glaciers. Sometimes\r\nalso there is an upturning of the ice along a longitudinal zone well\r\nback from the lateral margins (Fig. 273), and the material so borne\r\nto the surface in such a zone gives rise to a moraine resembling the\r\nmedial moraine formed by the union of lateral moraines, but of wholly\r\ndifferent origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 273.—Diagram illustrating the same point as 272,\r\n  where the structure is more complex. The bottom line of the figure\r\n  represents sea level.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of upturning here referred to has been observed only at\r\nor near the terminus of the ice, and is perhaps due in most part to the\r\nresistance of frozen morainic or other material beneath and in front of\r\nthe edge. To this should probably be added the effect of the increased\r\nrigidity of the ice at its borders, due to the low external temperature\r\nduring the larger part of the year, while the interior, with its\r\nhigher temperature, remains more fluent. But even this probably leaves\r\nthe explanation inadequate. In not a few instances the upturning is\r\nassociated with a notable _thickening_ of the layers toward their\r\nedges (Fig. 274). This suggests that perhaps there is an exceptional\r\ngrowth of the granular crystals of the ice near the edge of the\r\nlayers, owing to the penetration of the surface-waters which are much\r\nmore abundant at the borders than elsewhere, and which in the arctic\r\nglaciers probably do not penetrate deeply before they reach a freezing\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n=Wear of drift in transit.=—Drift carried at the bottom of the ice is\r\nsubject to notable wear. The materials in transportation abrade one\r\nanother and are abraded by the bed over which they pass. Englacial\r\ndrift is subject to less wear because it is commonly more scattered.\r\nSuperglacial drift is worn little or none while it lies on the surface\r\nof the ice; but in so far as superglacial or englacial drift is derived\r\nfrom the basal load, it may show the same evidences of wear as the\r\nbasal drift itself. Superglacial drift often reveals its history in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 274.—Thickening of the upturned layers of ice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Deposition of the Drift._\r\n\r\n1. =Beneath the body of the ice.=—During the advance of a glacier,\r\ndeposition may take place both beneath the body of the ice and beneath\r\nits end and edges. Deposition beneath the body of the ice is liable to\r\ntake place wherever the topography favors lodgment, or wherever the ice\r\nis overloaded. The topography favoring deposition is much the same as\r\nthat favoring erosion, but the two processes are not favored at the\r\nsame point. Erosion is greatest on the “stoss” side of an obstruction\r\n(the side against which the ice advances), and deposition on the lee\r\nside. The ice is likely to be overloaded (1) just beyond a place where\r\nconditions have favored the gathering of a heavy load, and (2) where\r\nthe ice is rapidly thinning. On the whole, however, the deposition of\r\nmaterial beneath the main body of a glacier is much more than balanced\r\nby erosion in the same position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 275.—Glacier building an embankment. Southeast\r\n  side of McCormick Bay, North Greenland.]\r\n\r\n2. =At ends and edges of glaciers.=—At and near the end of a glacier\r\nthe conditions of deposition are somewhat different. Here deposition\r\nbeneath the ice goes on faster than elsewhere, chiefly because of the\r\nmore rapid melting and the more rapid thinning and weakening of the\r\nice. If the end of the glacier be stationary in position, drift is\r\nbeing continually brought to it and left there, for though the _end_ is\r\nstationary, the _ice_ continues to move. If the glacier moves forward\r\n500 feet per year, and if its end is melted at the same rate, all the\r\ndébris in the 500 feet of ice which has been melted has been deposited,\r\nand all except that which has been washed away has been deposited\r\nat and beneath the end of the glacier. If the end of the glacier\r\nis retreating, the retreat means that the waste at the end exceeds\r\nthe forward movement. If the ice advances 300 feet per year, and is\r\nmelted back 500 feet in the same time, all the débris carried by the\r\n500 feet which has been melted has been deposited, and largely in the\r\nnarrow zone (200 feet) from which the ice has receded. Even in this\r\ncase, therefore, there is a notable tendency to marginal accumulation.\r\nIf the end of the glacier is advancing 500 feet per year while it is\r\nbeing melted but 300 feet, all the drift in the 300 feet melted has\r\nbeen deposited, and chiefly at or beneath the immediate margin of the\r\nice. To the marginal and sub-marginal accumulations made in this way,\r\nthe material carried on the ice is added whenever the ice is melted\r\nfrom beneath it. This addition is sometimes considerable and sometimes\r\nmeagre. If the edge of the ice is without much fluctuation in position,\r\nthe material dumped over its end may take the form of a narrow ridge or\r\nbowlder-wall (_Geschiebe-wall_). If a glacier pushes material in front\r\nof it, this, too, becomes a part of the general terminal aggregation of\r\ndrift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 276.—Embankment completed. Near the last.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TYPES OF MORAINES.\r\n\r\n=The terminal moraine.=—The thick accumulation of drift made at the\r\nend of a glacier or at the edge of an ice sheet, especially where its\r\nend or edge is stationary, or nearly stationary, for a considerable\r\ntime, is the _terminal moraine_. That part of the aggregation deposited\r\nbeneath the ice is sometimes called the _lodge_ moraine (Figs. 275 and\r\n276; see also Fig. 235); that carried on the ice and dropped at its\r\nedge, the _dump_ moraine; and that pushed before the ice, the _push_\r\nmoraine. Many moraines marginal to the ice appear to be push moraines,\r\nwhen they are really lodge moraines from which the ice has withdrawn\r\n(Fig. 277). The push moraine can rarely be distinguished, and the dump\r\nmoraine by no means always, after the disappearance of the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 277.—End of a glacier a few miles west of\r\nKaslo on Lake Kootenai, B. C. A lodge moraine from which the ice has\r\nwithdrawn, giving it the appearance of a push moraine. It is possible\r\nthat the lodge moraine material has been pushed up a little by\r\nre-advance of the ice. (Atwood.)]\r\n\r\n=The ground moraine.=—When a glacier disappears by melting, all its\r\ndébris is deposited. All the drift deposited beneath the advancing\r\nice and all deposited from the base of the ice during its dissolution\r\nconstitutes the _ground moraine_. The thickness of the ground moraine\r\nis notably unequal. In general, it is thicker toward the terminus of\r\nthe glacier and thinner toward its source, but considerable portions of\r\na glacier’s bed are often left without débris when the ice melts. In\r\ngeneral, the terminal moraine is not only thicker, but more irregularly\r\ndisposed than the ground moraine.\r\n\r\n=The lateral moraines.=—The surface lateral moraines of valley glaciers\r\nare let down on the surface beneath when the ice melts out from under\r\nthem; but the lateral moraines in a valley from which the ice has\r\nmelted are not merely the lateral moraines which were on the glacier\r\nat a given time. They are often far more massive than any which ever\r\nexisted on the ice itself at any one time (Fig. 278). As a glacier\r\nretreats, its lateral moraine material is more or less bunched. Thus if\r\nthe ice advances 200 feet while its end is being melted back 300 feet,\r\nthe lateral moraines on the 300 feet melted are concentrated into 100\r\nfeet, as they are delivered on to the land by the melting of the ice\r\nfrom beneath. If the retreat of the end of a glacier be very slow, the\r\nbunching may be great. But even this cannot explain the massiveness of\r\nsome lateral moraines. Furthermore, the materials of which many lateral\r\nmoraines are composed are nearly as well worn as those of the ground\r\nmoraine. The massive lateral moraines of which this is true are often\r\nmade up chiefly of the drift accumulated beneath the lateral margins\r\nof the glaciers. This accumulation is the result of the lateral motion\r\nof the ice from center to side. Such sublateral accumulations are akin\r\nto terminal moraines. Some of the lateral moraines of ancient valley\r\nglaciers, such as those of the Uinta, Wasatch, and Bighorn mountains\r\nare several hundred feet high, and in one case about 1000 feet. In\r\nnorthern Italy lateral moraines are said to be 1500 to 2000 feet\r\nhigh.[132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 278.—A lateral moraine from which the ice has\r\n  retreated. Bighorn Mountains, Wyo. (Blackwelder.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 279.—Glacial drift, coarse and fine together.\r\n  (Geol. Surv. of N. J.)]\r\n\r\nMost of the material which was englacial during the transportation\r\nbecomes either subglacial or superglacial before deposition, for it\r\nordinarily reaches the bottom or the top of the ice before being\r\ndeposited. Where the ends or edges of a glacier are vertical or nearly\r\nso, as in the high arctic regions, deposition may take place from the\r\nenglacial position directly.\r\n\r\n=Distinctive nature of glacial deposits.=—The deposits made by\r\nglaciers are distinctive. In the first place the ice does not assort\r\nits material, and bowlders, cobbles, pebbles, sand, and clay are\r\nconfusedly commingled (Fig. 279). In this respect, the deposits of ice\r\ndiffer notably from those of water. Furthermore, many stones of the\r\ndrift show the peculiar type of wear which glaciers inflict. They are\r\nnot rounded as the stones carried by rivers, though they are notably\r\nworn. Many of them have subangular forms with planed and beveled\r\nfaces, the planes being striated and bruised (Fig. 254). The absence\r\nof stratification, the physical heterogeneity, and the striation\r\nof at least a part of the stones are among the most distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of glacial drift. A not less real though less obvious\r\ncharacteristic is the constitution of the fine material, for it is in\r\ngeneral not the product of rock decay, but of rock grinding. The fine\r\nmaterial handled by streams (except glacial streams) on the other hand,\r\nis usually the product of rock decay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 280.—Roche moutonnée, Victoria Harbor, B. C.]\r\n\r\n=Glaciated rock surfaces.=—Another distinctive mark which a glacier\r\nleaves behind it is the character of the surface of the rock on which\r\nthe drift rests. This is generally smoothed by the severe abrasion to\r\nwhich it has been subjected, and the smoothed surfaces are marked by\r\ngrooves and striæ, similar to those on the stones of the drift (Figs.\r\n255 and 256). Other distinctive features of a glaciated area are the\r\nrounded bosses of rock (_roches moutonnées_, Fig. 280; see also surface\r\nabout the lakes, Fig. 261), the rock basins, the lakes (Fig. 261),\r\nponds, and marshes, and the peculiar topographies resulting from the\r\nunequal erosion, and the still more unequal deposition of the drift.\r\nSurface bowlders, often unlike the underlying formations of rock, and\r\nsometimes in peculiar and apparently unstable positions, are still\r\nanother mark of a glaciated area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GLACIO-FLUVIAL WORK.\r\n\r\nThe constant but unequal waste of glaciers has already been referred\r\nto. The streams to which this gives rise are usually laden with\r\ngravel, sand and silt derived from the ice. Since the mud is often\r\nlight-colored, the streams are sometimes described as “milky.” Where\r\nthe amount of material carried is great, much of it is dropped at\r\na slight distance from the ice, the coarsest being dropped first.\r\nGlacial streams are, as a rule, aggrading streams, and therefore\r\ndevelop alluvial plains, called _valley trains_ (Fig. 281 and 282),\r\nor where they enter lakes (Fig. 283), bays, or other streams, deltas.\r\nIn its transportation, the river-borne drift is assorted; after its\r\ndeposition, it is stratified. True glacial deposits in the upper\r\npart of a mountain valley are, therefore, often continued below by\r\nglacio-fluvial deposits derived from the same source.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 281.—Alluviation by glacial stream: Nicolai\r\n  Creek, Alaska. (Schrader, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe most common form of such deposit is a _valley train_ (Fig. 281) of\r\nglacial wash stretching indefinitely down the valley. The silt, sand,\r\nand gravel of such trains can usually be distinguished from valley\r\ndeposits of non-glacial origin by the character of the material, as\r\nmuch of it is the product of grinding, crushing, and fracture, rather\r\nthan of ordinary surface decay. Its materials are, therefore, fresh\r\nand often include rock material which, if long exposed at the surface,\r\nwould be decomposed or dissolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 282.—Alluviation by glacial stream below Hidden\r\n  glacier, Alaska. (Gilbert, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nWhere an ice sheet ends in a broad face, as did the ancient continental\r\nglaciers, numerous streams flow from it and spread their débris in\r\nfront of the terminal moraine, forming a broad fringing sheet or\r\n“apron” (_outwash plain_) along it. Where streams of considerable size\r\nform tunnels under or in the ice, these may become more or less filled\r\nwith wash, and when the ice melts the aggraded channels appear as long\r\nridges of gravel and sand known as _eskers_ (_osars_ and _serpentine\r\nkames_ and _kames_ of authors. See chapter on glacial period). It has\r\nbeen thought that similar ridges are sometimes formed in valleys cut\r\nin the ice from top to bottom, and even that they arise from gravel\r\nand sand lodged in superglacial channels. The latter at least is\r\nprobably rare, as the surface streams usually have high gradients,\r\nswift currents, and smooth bottoms, and hence give little opportunity\r\nfor lodgment. In the case of ice-sheets, too, in connection with which\r\neskers are chiefly developed, there is usually no surface material\r\nexcept at the immediate edge, where the ice is thin and its layers\r\nupturned.\r\n\r\nAt the mouths of ice-tunnels or ice-channels, especially where they\r\nend against terminal moraines, sands and gravels are liable to be\r\nbunched in quantity, giving rise, after the adjacent ice has melted,\r\nto peculiar hills and hollows of the knob-and-basin type. The hills\r\nand short ridges are known as _kames_ (see glacial period). Subglacial\r\nstreams may leave washed and assorted material in their tracks under\r\nthe ice, and this is sometimes buried under deposits made by the ice\r\nitself, so that glacio-fluvial and glacial deposits are interbedded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 283.—Delta at Isola, Lake of Sils, Engadine,\r\n  Switzerland. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ICEBERGS.\r\n\r\nWhen glaciers advance into water, the depth of which approaches their\r\nthickness, their ends are broken off (Fig. 284), and the detached\r\nmasses float away as icebergs (Fig. 285). Many of the bergs are\r\noverturned, or at least tilted, as they set sail. If this does not\r\nhappen at the outset, it is likely to occur later as the result of the\r\nmelting and wave-cutting which disturb their equilibrium. The great\r\nmajority of bergs do not travel far before losing all trace of stony\r\nand earthy débris, but the finding of glacial material in dredgings far\r\nsouth of all glaciers shows that they occasionally carry stones far\r\nfrom land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 284.—End of Muir glacier, Alaska. (Reid.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE INTIMATE STRUCTURE AND THE MOVEMENT OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nWith the preceding account of glaciers in mind, we may return to a\r\ncloser study of their origin, their intimate structure, and their mode\r\nof motion. The key to this study is the thesis that a glacier is a mass\r\nof crystalline rock—the purest and simplest type of crystalline rock\r\nknown—since it is made up of a single mineral of simple composition\r\nand rare purity, which never appears in a solid state except in the\r\ncrystalline form.\r\n\r\n=The growth and constitution of a glacier.=—The origin and history\r\nof a glacier is little more than the origin and aggregate history of\r\nthe crystals that compose it. The fundamental conception of a glacier\r\nis therefore best obtained by tracing the growth of its constituent\r\ncrystals. A basal fact ever to be kept in mind is that water in\r\nthe solid form is always controlled by crystalline forces. When it\r\nsolidifies from the vapor of the atmosphere it takes the form of\r\nseparate crystals (Figs. 286–291). Perfect forms are developed only\r\nwhen the flakes fall quietly through a saturated atmosphere which\r\nallows them to grow as they descend. Under other conditions, the\r\ncrystals are imperfect in growth and are mutilated by impact. But\r\nhowever modified, they are always crystals. The molecules are arranged\r\non the hexagonal plan, and, as the expansive power of freezing water\r\nshows, the arrangement is controlled by a strong force. Once the\r\ndefinite crystalline arrangement is established, the molecules can be\r\ndisplaced only by relatively great force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 285.—An iceberg, west coast of Greenland.]\r\n\r\nSnow crystals often continue to grow so long as they are in the\r\natmosphere; but if they pass through an under-saturated stratum of\r\nair or a stratum whose temperature is above 32° Fahr., they suffer\r\nfrom evaporation or melting. When they reach the ground, the processes\r\nof growth and decadence continue, and the crystals grow or diminish\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nA glacier is a colossal aggregation of crystals grown from snowflakes\r\nto granules of much greater sizes. The microscopic study of new-fallen\r\nsnow reveals the mode of change from flakes to granules. The slender\r\npoints and angles of the former yield to melting and evaporation more\r\nthan the more massive central portions, and this change probably\r\nillustrates a law of vital importance. It may often be seen that the\r\nwater melted from the periphery of a flake gathers about its center,\r\nand if the temperature be right, it freezes there. This is a first\r\nstep toward the pronounced granulation of snow which has lain for some\r\ntime on the ground. If measured systematically from day to day, the\r\nlarger granules taken from beneath the surface of this coarse-grained\r\nsnow are found to be growing. In a series of experiments[133] to\r\ndetermine the law of growth it was found that when the temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere was above the melting-point the growth was appreciably\r\nmore rapid than when the air was colder, but there was, on the average,\r\n_an increase under all conditions of temperature_. A portion of this\r\naverage increase of the larger granules appears to come from the\r\ndiminution and destruction of the smaller ones, for the total number\r\nof granules steadily diminishes. A portion of the growth doubtless\r\ncomes from the moisture of the atmosphere which penetrates the snow\r\nand another portion from the moisture derived from surface melting;\r\nbut beneath the surface of a large body of snow the growth of the\r\nlarge granules is probably chiefly at the expense of the small ones.\r\nTo follow the process it should be noted that the free surface of\r\nevery granule is constantly throwing off particles of water-vapor\r\n(evaporation); that the rate at which the particles are thrown off is\r\ndependent, among other things, on the curvature of the surface, being\r\ngreater the sharper the curve; that the surfaces of the granules are\r\nat the same time liable to receive and retain molecules thrown from\r\nother granules, and that, other things being equal, the retention\r\nof particles also depends on the curvature of the surface, the less\r\ncurved surface retaining more than the sharply curved one. Under these\r\nlaws, it is obvious that the larger granules of smaller curvature will\r\nlose less and gain more, on the average, than the smaller granules of\r\ngreater curvature. It follows that the larger granules will grow at the\r\nexpense of the smaller. It is also to be noted that, other things being\r\nequal, small granules melt more readily than large ones, and that where\r\nthe temperature is nicely adjusted between melting and freezing, the\r\nsmaller may lose while the larger gain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 286–91.—Snowflakes. (Photographed by W. A.\r\n  Bentley.)]\r\n\r\nAnother factor that enters into the process is that of pressure and\r\ntension. The granules are compressed at the points of contact and put\r\nunder tension at points not in contact, and the pressure and tension\r\nare, on the average, likely to be relatively greatest for the smallest\r\ngranules. Tension increases the tendency to evaporation and adds its\r\neffects to curvature, and the capillary spaces adjoining the points\r\nof contact probably favor condensation. Ice expands in crystallizing\r\nand pressure reduces the melting-point, while tension raises it. The\r\neffect of this is slight (p. 276), and it probably plays little part in\r\nglacial action, but it is to be correlated with the much more important\r\nfact that _compression produces heat_ which may raise the temperature\r\nof the ice to the melting-point, while tension may reduce the\r\ntemperature to or below freezing. There is therefore a tendency for the\r\nice to melt at the points of contact and compression, and for the water\r\nso produced to refreeze at adjacent points where the surface is under\r\ntension. This process becomes effective beneath a considerable body of\r\nsnow, and here the granules gradually lose the spheroidal form assumed\r\nin the early stages of granulation and become irregular polyhedrons\r\ninterlocked into a more or less solid mass.\r\n\r\nA third factor is also to be recognized, though its effectiveness is\r\nunknown. Under severe wind pressure, air penetrates porous bodies\r\nwith appreciable facility. The “breathing” of soils and the curious\r\nphenomena of “blowing-wells” and “blowing-caves” teach us of the\r\neffective penetration and extrusion of the air under variations of\r\nbarometric pressure. In the snow-fields, and in the more granular\r\nportions of glaciers near their heads, the porosity is doubtless\r\nsufficient to allow of the appreciable penetration of the atmosphere.\r\nDuring a part of the time, the probable effect is the condensation\r\nwithin the ice of moisture from the air, and during another part,\r\nevaporation from the ice. These alternating processes are attended by\r\noscillations of temperature. While the balance between loss and gain\r\nof substance may be immaterial, the oscillating nature of the process\r\nand the fluctuations of temperature are probably favorable to granular\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nWhether these processes furnish an adequate explanation of the changes\r\nor not, the observed fact is that there are all gradations from\r\nsnowflakes and pellets into granular névé, and thence into glacier\r\ngranules (_Gletscherkörner_), varying in size up to that of filberts\r\nand walnuts, and even beyond. In coherence, these aggregations may\r\nvary from the early slightly coherent granular stage, where the grains\r\nare small and spheroidal, to the ice stage, where the cohesion has\r\nbecome strong through the interlocking growths of the large granules.\r\nEven when the mass has become seemingly solid ice, sufficient space is\r\nusually left between the granules to give the dispersive reflection to\r\nlight which imparts to glacier ice its distinctive whitish color.\r\n\r\n=The arrangement of the crystal axes.=—The most radical difference\r\nbetween glacier ice and ice formed directly from water is in the\r\narrangement (orientation) of the crystals. In the ice formed on\r\nundisturbed water, the bases of the crystals are at the surface and\r\ntheir principal axes are vertical, as shown by Mügge.[134] As they\r\ngrow, the crystal prisms extend downwards. This gives a columnar or\r\nprismatic structure to the ice, well seen when it is “honeycombed”\r\nby partial melting. In the glacier, on the other hand, the crystals,\r\nstarting from snowflakes, have their axes turned in various directions\r\naccording to the accidents of their fall; and as the snow develops\r\ninto ice, the principal axes of the crystals continue to lie in all\r\ndirections. Hence glacier ice, unlike pond ice, cannot usually be split\r\nalong definite planes, except where cleavage planes are subsequently\r\ndeveloped by extraneous agencies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 291_a_. +Fig.+ 291_b_. +Fig.+ 291_c_.\r\n\r\n  Figures to illustrate the method of deformation of ice crystals.]\r\n\r\nWhile the crystals of a glacier usually have their principal axes in\r\nvarious directions, there appears to be a tendency for them to approach\r\nparallelism in certain positions, especially in the basal parts of a\r\nglacier near its terminus. Observations on this point are not so full\r\nand critical as could be desired, but it is probable that the parallel\r\norientation is partly general, and due to the vertical pressure of the\r\nice, and partly special and local, and connected with the shearing\r\nplanes and foliation.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this partial parallelism of the crystals on shearing and\r\nfoliation is supposed to reside in the fact that a crystal of ice is\r\nmade up of a series of plates arranged at right angles to the principal\r\naxis of the crystal. These plates may be likened to a pile of cards,\r\nthe principal axis being represented by a line vertical to them. If\r\na cube be cut from a large crystal of ice, it will behave much like\r\na cube cut from the pile of cards. If the cube be so placed that its\r\nplates are horizontal (Fig. 291_a_), and if it be rested on supports at\r\ntwo edges and heavily weighted in the middle, it will sag, the plates\r\nsliding slightly over one another so as to give oblique ends, but in\r\nthis case the cube offers considerable resistance to deformation. If\r\nthe cube be so placed that the plates stand on edge, each reaching from\r\nsupport to support (Fig. 291_b_), it will offer very great resistance\r\nto deformation; but if the plates be vertical and transverse to the\r\nline joining the supports, as in Fig. 291_c_, the middle portion will\r\nsag under very moderate weighting by the sliding of the plates on one\r\nanother, and in a comparatively short time the middle portion may be\r\npushed entirely out, dividing the cube. These properties have been\r\ndemonstrated by McConnel[135] and Mügge, and they appear to throw light\r\non certain phases of the action of glaciers that are most pronounced in\r\ntheir basal parts, and are best illustrated in arctic glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _The Probable Fundamental Element in Glacial Motion._\r\n\r\n=Melting and freezing.=—It has already been shown (p. 279) that the\r\ninitial or fundamental cause of glacial motion must be operative at the\r\nheads of glaciers where the temperature is lowest and the material\r\nmost loosely granular. In this condition, there is reason to believe\r\nthat motion takes place between the grains, rather than by their\r\ndistortion through the displacement of their laminæ. The fact that the\r\ngranular structure is not destroyed, as it would be by the indefinite\r\nsliding of the crystal plates over each other, sustains this view. The\r\ninference is that the gliding planes play a notable rôle in glacial\r\nmovement only in the basal parts of the lower ends of glaciers, where\r\nthe greatest thrusts are developed, and where the granules have become\r\nlargest and most completely interlocked. At the heads of glaciers,\r\nwhere motion is initiated, there may be great downward pressure, but\r\nnot vigorous thrusts from behind, and probably only moderate thrusts\r\ndeveloped within the body itself. There seems therefore no escape from\r\nthe conclusion that the primal cause of glacial motion is one which\r\nmay operate even under the relatively low temperatures, the relatively\r\ndry conditions, and the relatively granular textures which affect the\r\nheads of glaciers. These considerations lead to the view that movement\r\ntakes place by the minute individual movements of the grains upon one\r\nanother. While they are in the spheroidal form, as in the névé, this\r\nwould not seem to be at all difficult. They may rotate and slide over\r\neach other as the weight of the snow increases; but as they become\r\ninterlocked by growth, both rotation and sliding must apparently\r\nencounter more resistance. The amount of rotary motion required of an\r\nindividual granule is, however, surprisingly small, and the meltings\r\nand refreezings incident to shifting pressures and tensions, and to\r\nthe growth of the granules, seem adequate to meet the requirements.\r\nIn order to account for a movement of three feet per day in a glacier\r\nsix miles long, the mean motion of the average granule relative to its\r\nneighbor would be, roundly, ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀ of its own diameter per day, or one\r\ndiameter in 10,000 days; in other words, it would _change its relations\r\nto its neighbors_ to the extent of its diameter in about thirty\r\nyears. A change of so great slowness under the conditions of granular\r\nalteration can scarcely be thought incredible, or even improbable, in\r\nspite of the interlocking which the granules may develop. The movement\r\nis supposed to be permitted chiefly by the temporary passage of minute\r\nportions of the granules into the fluid form at the points of greatest\r\ncompression, the transfer of the moisture to adjoining points, and its\r\nresolidification. The points of greatest compression are obviously\r\njust those whose yielding most promotes motion, and a successive\r\nyielding of the points that come in succession to oppose motion most\r\n(and thus to receive the greatest stresses) permits continuous motion.\r\nIt is merely necessary to assume that the gravity of the accumulated\r\nmass is sufficient to produce the minute temporary liquefaction at the\r\npoints of greatest stress, the result being accomplished not so much\r\nby the lowering of the melting-point as by the development of heat by\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 292.—Portion of the east face of Bowdoin glacier,\r\n  North Greenland, showing oblique upward thrust, with shear.]\r\n\r\nThis conception of glacial “flowage” involves only the _momentary\r\nliquefaction of minute portions of the mass_, while the ice as a whole\r\nremains rigid, as its crystalline nature requires. Instead of assigning\r\na slow viscous fluidity like that of asphalt to the _whole_ mass, which\r\nseems inconsistent with its crystalline character, it assigns a free\r\nfluidity to a succession of particles that form only a minute fraction\r\nof the whole at any instant.\r\n\r\nThis conception is consistent with the retention of the granular\r\ncondition of the ice, with the heterogeneous (in the main) orientation\r\nof the crystals, with the rigidity and brittleness of the ice, and with\r\nits strictly crystalline character, a character which a viscous liquid\r\ndoes not possess however much its high viscosity may make it resemble a\r\nrigid body.\r\n\r\n=Accumulated motion in the terminal part of a glacier.=—However slight\r\nthe relative motion of one granule on its neighbor, the granules in any\r\npart of a glacier partake in the accumulated motion of all parts nearer\r\nthe source, and hence all are thrust forward. Herein appears to lie the\r\ndistinctive nature of glacial movement. Each part of a stream of water\r\nfeels the hydrostatic pressure of neighboring parts (theoretically\r\nequal in _all_ directions) and the momentum of motion, but not the\r\nrigid thrust of the mass behind. Lava streams are good types of viscous\r\nfluids flowing in masses comparable to those of glaciers and on similar\r\nslopes, and, in their last stages, at similar rates, but their special\r\nmodes of flow and their effects on the sides and bottoms of their paths\r\nare radically different from those of glaciers. Forceful abrasion, and\r\nparticularly the rigid holding of imbedded stones while they score and\r\ngroove the rock beneath, is unknown in lava streams and is scarcely\r\nconceivable. There is, so far as we know, no experimental or natural\r\nevidence that any typical viscous body in flowing over a rugose bottom\r\ndetaches and picks up fragments and holds them as graving tools in its\r\nbase so fixedly as to cut deep, long, straight grooves in the hard\r\nbottom over which it flows. It would seem that competency to do this\r\npeculiar class of work, which is distinctive of glaciers, should be\r\ndemonstrated before the viscous theory of glacial movement is accepted\r\nas even a good working hypothesis. Somewhat in contrast with viscous\r\nmovement, it is conceived that a glacier is thrust forward rigidly by\r\ninternal elongation, shears forcibly over its sides and bottoms, and\r\nleaves its distinctive marks upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 293.—Shearing plane well defined. A Spitsbergen\r\n  glacier. (Hamberg.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Auxiliary Elements._\r\n\r\n=Shearing.=—In the lower portion of a glacier where normally the\r\nthrusts are greatest, the granules fewest, and their interlocking\r\nmost intimate, shearing takes place within the ice itself. This is\r\nillustrated by the accompanying Figs., 292–295. The shearing results\r\nin the foliation of the ice and in the forcing of débris between the\r\nsheared layers. Thus the ice becomes loaded in a special englacial or\r\nbaso-englacial fashion, as previously mentioned and illustrated in Fig.\r\n268.\r\n\r\nWithin the zone of shearing, it is probable that the gliding planes\r\nof the crystals come into effective function. It is thought that the\r\ncombined effect of the vertical pressure, the forward thrust, and the\r\nbasal drag of the ice, may be to increase the number of granules whose\r\ngliding planes are parallel to the glacier’s bottom. At any rate,\r\nDrygalski reports[136] that there is a tendency to such an arrangement\r\nin the basal portion of the Greenland glaciers at their borders. It\r\nis conceived that where strong thrusts are brought to bear upon such\r\na mass of granules, those whose gliding planes are parallel to the\r\ndirection of thrust are strained with sufficient intensity to cause the\r\nplates to slide over each other, while those which are not parallel\r\nto the direction of thrust are either rotated into parallelism—when\r\nthey also yield—or are pressed aside out of the plane of shear. As\r\npreviously noted, shearing is observed to occur chiefly where the ice\r\nbelow the plane of shearing is protected more or less from the force\r\nof the thrust. It perhaps also occurs where the basal ice becomes so\r\noverloaded with débris that it is incapable of ready movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 294.—Portion of the lateral margin of a North\r\n  Greenland glacier. Shows upturning of the layers at the base, the\r\n  cleanness of the ice above the bottom, and, possibly, shearing.]\r\n\r\nIt is also probable that sharp differential strain and shearing are\r\ndeveloped at the level where the surface-water of the warm season,\r\ndescending into the ice, reaches the zone of freezing. The expanding of\r\nthe freezing water at the upper limit of the cold zone may cause the\r\nlayer expanded by it to shear over that below. As the level of freezing\r\nis lowered with the advance of the warm season, the zone of shearing\r\nalso sinks. This may be regarded as an auxiliary agency of shearing, of\r\napplication to a special horizon.\r\n\r\n=High temperature and water.=—In the zone of waste, a higher\r\ntemperature and more water lend their aid to the fundamental\r\nagencies of movement, and there is need for these aids to promote a\r\nproportionate movement, for here the granules are more intimately\r\ninterlocked and the ice more compact and inherently more solid and\r\nrigid. The average temperature is, however, near the melting-point (p.\r\n276), and during the warm season the ice is bathed in water so that\r\nthe necessary changes in the crystals are facilitated, and movement\r\napparently takes place even more readily than in the more open granular\r\nportion of lower temperature and dryer state. The extraordinary\r\nmovements of certain tongues of ice in some of the great fiords of\r\nGreenland are probably due to the convergence of very thick slow-moving\r\nice from the interior into basins leading down to the fiords. Into the\r\nsame basins a large amount of surface-water is concentrated at the same\r\ntime, with the result that the thick ice, bathed with water and having\r\na high gradient, develops unusual velocity during the warm season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 295.—Lateral margin of a North Greenland glacier,\r\n  Inglefield Gulf region. The overhanging edges of the successive\r\n  layers are not altogether the result of shear. They are due in part\r\n  at least to differential melting along the lines where débris comes\r\n  to the surface. The débris planes may be shear planes.]\r\n\r\n=Applications.=—By a studious consideration of the coöperation of the\r\nauxiliary agencies with the fundamental ones, the peculiarities of\r\nglacial movement may apparently be explained. In regions of intense\r\ncold, where a dry state and low temperature prevail, as in the heart\r\nof Greenland, the snow-ice mass may accumulate to extraordinary\r\nthicknesses, for the burden of movement seems to be thrown almost\r\nwholly upon compression, with the slight aid of molecular changes due\r\nto internal evaporation and allied inefficient processes. Since the\r\ntemperature in the upper part of the ice is very adverse (see p. 277),\r\nthe compression must be great before it becomes effective in melting\r\nthe ice, and hence the great thickness of the mass antecedent to much\r\nmotion. Similar conditions more or less affect the heads of alpine\r\nglaciers, though here the high gradients favor motion with lesser\r\nthicknesses of ice; but in the lower reaches of alpine glaciers, where\r\nthe temperatures are near the melting-point, and the ice is bathed in\r\nwater, movement may take place in ice which is thin and compact.\r\n\r\nIf the views here presented are correct, there is also, near the end\r\nor edge of a glacier, the coöperation of rigid thrust from behind with\r\nthe tendency of the mass to move on its own account. The latter is\r\ncontrolled by gravity, and conforms in its results to laws of liquid\r\nflow. The former is a derived factor, and is a mechanical thrust. This\r\nthrust is different from the pressure of the upper part of a liquid\r\nstream on the lower part, because it is transmitted through a body\r\nwhose rigidity is effective, while the latter is transmitted on the\r\nhydrostatic principle of equal pressure in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Corroborative Phenomena._\r\n\r\nThe conception of the glacier and its movement here presented explains\r\nsome of the anomalies that otherwise seem paradoxical. While a glacier\r\nin a sense flows over a surface, it often cuts long, deep furrows in\r\nfirm rock. It is difficult to explain this if the ice be so yielding\r\nas to flow under its own weight on a surface which is almost flat. If\r\nthe mass is really viscous, its hold on its imbedded débris should\r\nalso be viscous, and a bowlder in the bottom should be rotated in the\r\nyielding mass when its lower point catches on the rock beneath, instead\r\nof being firmly held while a deep groove is cut. This is more to the\r\npoint since viscous fluids flow by a partially rotary movement. If,\r\non the other hand, the ice is always a rigid body which yields only\r\nas its interlocking granules change their form by loss and gain, a\r\nrigid hold on the imbedded rock at some times, and a yielding hold at\r\nothers, is intelligible, for on this view the nature of its hold is\r\ndependent on the temperature and dryness of the ice. Stones in the base\r\nof a glacier may be held with very great rigidity when the ice is dry,\r\nscoring the bottom with much force, while they may be rotated with\r\nrelative ease when the ice is wet. In short, the relation of the ice to\r\nthe bowlders in its bottom varies radically according to its dryness\r\nand temperature. _A dry glacier is a rigid glacier. A dry glacier is\r\nnecessarily cold, and a cold glacier is necessarily dry._\r\n\r\nOn the view here presented, a glacier should be more rigid in winter\r\nthan in summer, and the whole thickness of the glacier should\r\nexperience this rigidity chiefly at the ends and edges, where the\r\nrelative thinness of the ice permits the low temperature to reach its\r\nbottom. The motion in these parts during the winter is, therefore, very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nIn this view may also be found an explanation of the movement of\r\nglaciers for considerable distances on upward slopes, even when the\r\n_surface_ as well as the base is inclined backwards. So far does\r\nthis go that superglacial streams sometimes run for some distance\r\n_backwards_, i.e. toward the heads of the glaciers, while in other\r\nplaces surface-waters are collected into ponds and lakelets. Such a\r\nslope of the surface of ice is not difficult to understand if the\r\nmovement be due to thrust from behind, or if it be occasioned by\r\ninternal crystalline changes acting upon a rigid body; but it must be\r\nregarded as very remarkable if the movement be that of a fluid body,\r\nno matter how viscous, for the length of the acclivity is sometimes\r\nseveral times the thickness of the ice. Crevassing and other evidences\r\nof brittleness and rigidity find a ready elucidation under the view\r\nthat the ice is a really solid body at all times, and that its apparent\r\nfluency is due to the momentary fluidity of small portions of the mass\r\nassumed in succession as compression demands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the considerations already adduced, it may be urged that\r\na glacier does not flow as a stiff liquid because its granules are not\r\nhabitually drawn out into elongated forms, as are cavities in lavas and\r\nplastic lumps in viscous bodies. Flowage lines comparable to those in\r\nlavas are unknown in glaciers.\r\n\r\nAll this is strictly consistent with our primary thesis, that a glacier\r\nis a crystalline rock of the purest and simplest type, and that it\r\nnever has other than the crystalline state. This strictly crystalline\r\ncharacter is incompatible with viscous liquidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Other Views of Glacier Motion._[137]\r\n\r\nWhile these views of glacial motion seem to us to best accord with the\r\nknown facts, they are not to be regarded as established in scientific\r\nopinion, or as the views most commonly held. The mode of glacial\r\nmotion has long been a mooted question, and is still so regarded. The\r\nmain alternative interpretations that have been entertained are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) In the early days of glacial studies De Saussure thought that\r\nglaciers slid bodily on their beds;\r\n\r\n(2) Charpentier and Agassiz referred the movement to the expansion of\r\ndescending water freezing within the glacier;\r\n\r\n(3) Rendu and Forbes, followed by many, perhaps most, modern writers,\r\nbelieved ice to be viscous, and that in sufficiently large masses it\r\nflows under the influence of its own weight, like pitch or asphalt;\r\n\r\n(4) Others, realizing the fundamental difference between crystalline\r\nice and a true viscous body, have fallen back on a vague notion of\r\nplasticity which scarcely amounts to a definite hypothesis at all;\r\n\r\n(5) Tyndall urged that the movement was accomplished by minute repeated\r\nfracturing and regelation, appealing to the fact that broken pieces of\r\nice slightly pressed together at melting temperatures freeze together,\r\nbut neglecting the fact that this would destroy the integrity of the\r\ncrystals;\r\n\r\n(6) Moseley assigned the movement to a bodily expansion and\r\ncontraction of the glacier, analogous to the creeping of a mass of\r\nlead on a roof;\r\n\r\n(7) James Thompson demonstrated that pressure lowers the melting-point,\r\nand while this effect is so small as probably to be ineffectual, it\r\nis correlated with the very important fact that compression may cause\r\nmelting, which is not the case in most other rocks. He recognized that\r\nunder pressure partial liquefaction took place, that the water so\r\nliberated might be refrozen as it escaped from pressure, and appears to\r\nhave regarded this as a vital factor;\r\n\r\n(8) Croll held that the movement was due to a consecutive series of\r\nmolecular changes somewhat like the chain of chemical combinations in\r\nelectrolysis;\r\n\r\n(9) Hugi, Eli de Beaumont, Bertin, Forel, and others thought that the\r\ngrowth of the granules was the leading factor in the ice movement;\r\n\r\n(10) McConnel and Mügge have made the gliding planes of the ice\r\ncrystals serve an important function in glacial movement.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the principle of partial liquefaction for which\r\nThompson laid the basis, the crystallization of descending water, urged\r\nby Charpentier and Agassiz, and the granular growth on which Hugi,\r\nBeaumont, Forel, and others founded their hypotheses, are incorporated\r\nin the view already presented. Probably the agencies on which some of\r\nthe other views are based may also be participants in producing glacial\r\nmotion, sometimes as incidental factors, and sometimes perhaps as\r\nimportant ones, for under different conditions, different agencies may\r\nplay rôles of varying importance. For example, in going over the brinks\r\nof precipices of sufficient height, glaciers break into fragments\r\nwhich are re-cemented below, and the “reconstructed” glacier moves on\r\nas before. Here fracture and regelation are evident. The movement of\r\nthe gliding planes of the ice crystals over each other, which has been\r\nlooked upon as a special kind of viscoid movement, probably plays a\r\nlarge part in the shearing movements in certain cases. But neither of\r\nthese is probably a large factor in ordinary glacial movement, and it\r\nseems highly improbable that any of them are essential factors in the\r\nprimary movements in the snow-fields where glacial action begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                        THE WORK OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general facts concerning the depth of the ocean and the\r\ndistribution of its water have been given on a preceding page (p. 8),\r\nand the origin of the ocean and the ocean basins is discussed in the\r\nsecond volume. This chapter has to do primarily with the processes\r\nnow going on in the sea and its borders, in so far as they are of\r\nimportance in the interpretation of geologic history. The study of\r\nthese processes is prefaced by a few words concerning the amount and\r\ncomposition of the sea-water, the life of the ocean, and the topography\r\nof its bed.[138]\r\n\r\n=Volume and composition.=—Every 1000 parts of sea-water contain about\r\n34.40 parts by weight of mineral matter in solution. The principal\r\nsolids, acids, and bases, combined according to the principles laid\r\ndown by Dittmar, are shown in the following table:[2]\r\n\r\n  Chloride of sodium                                    77.758\r\n  Chloride of magnesium                                 10.878\r\n  Sulphate of magnesium                                  4.737\r\n  Sulphate of calcium                                    3.600\r\n  Sulphate of potassium                                  2.465\r\n  Bromide of magnesium                                   0.217\r\n  Carbonate of calcium                                   0.345\r\n                                                       -------\r\n       Total salts                                     100.000\r\n\r\nExpressed in terms of tons per cubic mile of sea-water, the composition\r\nis as follows:[139]\r\n\r\n                                              Tons per Cubic Mile.\r\n  Chloride of sodium (NaCl)                        117,434,000\r\n  Chloride of magnesium (MgCl₂)                     16,428,000\r\n  Sulphate of magnesium (MgSO₄)                      7,154,000\r\n  Sulphate of calcium (CaSO₄)                        5,437,000\r\n  Sulphate of potassium (K₂SO₄)                      3,723,000\r\n  Bromide of magnesium (MgBr₂)                         328,000\r\n  Carbonate of calcium (CaCO₃)                         521,000\r\n                                                   -----------\r\n       For sea-water, total dissolved matter       151,025,000\r\n\r\nAside from the ingredients shown in the above tables, the presence of\r\nthe following has been proved: iodine, fluorine, phosphorus, silicon,\r\nboron, silver, lead, copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese,\r\naluminum, barium, strontium, arsenic, lithium, cæsium, rubidium, and\r\ngold. Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid gas are also present in\r\nquantity. The amount of carbonic acid is estimated to be 18 times as\r\ngreat as in the atmosphere.[140]\r\n\r\nThe amount of sea-water is estimated by Murray at 323,722,150 cubic\r\nmiles,[141] or about 15 times the volume of the land above sea-level.\r\nThe volume and composition of the sea-water being known, the amount of\r\nmineral matter which it contains may be readily calculated. Assuming\r\nthe average specific gravity of the mineral matter in solution to be\r\n2.5, the 3.5% by weight becomes 1.4% by volume, and 1.4% of 323,722,150\r\ncubic miles is 4,532,110 cubic miles. This then represents the\r\naggregate volume of mineral matter in the sea if it were precipitated\r\nand compacted so as to have an average specific gravity of 2.5.\r\nAssuming the average depth of the sea to be 2076 fathoms (12,456 feet),\r\nas given by Murray, the mineral matter in solution, if precipitated,\r\nwould cover the ocean bottom to a depth of about 175 feet. Assuming the\r\narea of the land to be to that of the sea as 28 to 72, this amount of\r\nmineral matter would make a layer about 450 feet deep over the land.\r\nIts amount is equal to about 20% of that of all lands above sea-level,\r\nand it falls but little short of that in all lands below 600 feet in\r\naltitude. If it were precipitated and concentrated in the shallow\r\nwaters about the borders of the lands, it would fill the sea out to\r\nthe depth of about 4000 feet, and would diminish its area by some\r\n19,000,000 to 20,000,000 square miles, an area which is more than ⅓\r\nof the present land surface. In other words, if the mineral matter in\r\nthe sea-water were precipitated and concentrated in the shallow waters\r\nabout the lands, it would restore the continental shelves to the land\r\nareas, and add an almost equal area beyond.\r\n\r\nThese comparisons may perhaps help to give some idea of the amount of\r\nmineral matter in solution in the sea, but they give no more than a\r\nhint of the importance of the solvent power of water in the general\r\nprocesses of rock decay, for most of the substances carried to the sea\r\nin solution by rivers are extracted from the water about as rapidly\r\nas they are supplied. Thus calcium carbonate is about twenty times as\r\nabundant as sodium chloride in river-water,[142] but is only ¹⁄₁₂₅ as\r\nabundant in sea-water.\r\n\r\nThe total river discharge into the sea is estimated at 6524 cubic miles\r\nof water per year.[143] This water is estimated to carry to the sea\r\nannually about half a cubic mile of mineral matter in solution. At this\r\nrate it would take about 9,000,000 years for the streams to bring to\r\nthe sea an amount of mineral matter equal to that it now contains, but\r\nthe proportions of the ingredients would be very different.\r\n\r\nThe sodium chloride makes up about 2.4% of the mineral matter in\r\nriver-water and nearly 78% of the mineral matter of the sea. At this\r\nrate it would take nearly 300,000,000 years for the salt of the sea\r\nto have been contributed by the rivers. It is not to be understood,\r\nhowever, that this figure indicates the age of the ocean. The salt is\r\nnot all brought in by the rivers; the rivers have probably not always\r\ncontributed at the present rate; and much salt once in the sea has been\r\nprecipitated. Nevertheless the above figure gives some suggestion as to\r\nthe order of magnitude of the figures which represent the age of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the salt, the amount of calcium carbonate in the sea\r\nis so small that at their present rate of contribution, it would be\r\nbrought to the sea by rivers in about 62,000 years.\r\n\r\n=Topography of bed.=—The general relations of ocean basins to\r\ncontinents are suggested by Fig. 296. The borders of the continental\r\nplatforms are covered by the _epicontinental sea_, while the _abysmal\r\nsea_ occupies the ocean basins proper. From the figure it is seen that\r\nan ocean basin is pronouncedly convex upward, and so departs as widely\r\nas may be from the current notion of the homely utensil from which\r\nit is named. Only when it is remembered that a level surface (on the\r\nearth) is one which has the mean curvature of the earth, and that the\r\ndeeper parts of the ocean basin are well below the mean sphere level,\r\ndoes the current name seem justified.[144] The figure also shows that\r\nthe depth of an ocean basin is slight compared with the radius of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the ocean, like the face of the land, is affected by\r\nelevations and depressions, and its deepest points are about as far\r\nbelow its surface as the highest mountains are above it. There are\r\nareas of the sea bottom which, as a whole, may be compared to the\r\nplains of the land, and others which may be likened to plateaus, and\r\nthe lines of gradation between them are as indistinct as they often\r\nare on the land. There are mountain peaks, chiefly of volcanic origin,\r\nand depressions comparable to the great basins on the land. But apart\r\nfrom these general features, there is little in common between the\r\ntopography of the sea bottom and that of the land. Mountain systems\r\nare, for the most part, absent, though certain islands, like Cuba and\r\nsome of its associates, may be regarded as the crests of systems which\r\nare chiefly submerged. If the water were drawn off from the ocean’s\r\nbed so that it could be seen as the land is, its most impressive\r\nfeature would be its monotony. The familiar hills and valleys which,\r\nin all their multitudinous forms, give the land surface its most\r\ncharacteristic features are essentially absent. A large part of its\r\nsurface would be found to be so nearly flat that the eye would not\r\ndetect its departure from planeness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 296.—General relations of ocean basins to the\r\n  lithosphere. Lat. 20° S. Depth of the water (black) and height of\r\n  land exaggerated ten times. (Data from Murray, Scot. Geogr. Mag.,\r\n  Vol. XV, 1899.)]\r\n\r\nThe reason for this profound difference is readily found. On the land,\r\nthe dominant processes which shape the details of the surface are\r\ndegradational, and though the final result of degradation is flatness\r\n(base-level), the immediate result is relief, and, most commonly,\r\nrelief of the hill-and-valley type. In the sea, the dominant processes\r\nare aggradational, and tend to monotonous planeness.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of marine life.=—Marine life has been of such importance\r\nin the history of the earth that the elementary facts concerning its\r\ndistribution and the principles which control it are here recalled.\r\nThe distribution of marine life is influenced by many factors, chief\r\namong which are _temperature_ and _depth of water_. Not only is life\r\nmore abundant in the warmer parts of the ocean than in the colder, but\r\nthe species inhabiting cold waters are different from those in warm,\r\nand few species range through great variations. Many forms of life\r\nare restricted to shallow water. Many more, especially those which do\r\nnot live on the bottom, swim about freely without reference to the\r\ndepth of the water beneath them, while relatively few are restricted\r\nto great depths. Many species are also influenced by the _salinity of\r\nthe water_, which varies notably along coasts where the fresh waters\r\nfrom the land are discharged; by the _character of the sediment_ at the\r\nbottom, some species preferring mud, others sand, and others gravel;\r\nby the _movement of the waters_, some species preferring still waters\r\nand others rough; and some species by the _abundance and nature of the\r\nfood-supply_, and by _rival and hostile species_.\r\n\r\nSubject to the exceptions determined by temperature, etc., plant life\r\nabounds in shallow water out to depths of 100 fathoms or so, and is\r\nfound in abundance at the surface where the depth is much greater.\r\nAnimal life abounds in shallow water, both at the bottom and above it,\r\nout to depths of 200 or 300 fathoms, and occurs in great profusion in\r\nthe surface-waters of temperate and tropical regions without regard to\r\nthe depth. The great body of the ocean water lying below a depth of\r\nsome few hundred fathoms is nearly tenantless, though life reappears\r\nsparingly at the bottom, even where the depth is great. For further\r\ndiscussion of this topic, see Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PROCESSES IN OPERATION IN THE SEA.\r\n\r\nWithin the area of the sea, as on the area of the land, three sets of\r\nprocesses are at work—_diastrophism_, _vulcanism_, and _gradation_.\r\n\r\n=Diastrophism= (p. 2) affects the sea-bottom as the land, but the\r\nresults are notably different in certain respects. So far as the\r\nlithosphere is concerned, the sea-level may be said to be the critical\r\nlevel. At and above it, many processes are in operation which do not\r\nappear below, and below it, many which do not take place above. Changes\r\nof level which do not involve the submergence of areas which were\r\nland, or the emergence of areas which were under water, are relatively\r\nunimportant, compared with those which effect such changes. The rise\r\nof the bottom of the sea from a depth of 500 fathoms to a depth of 200\r\nfathoms would not lead to important consequences, so far as the area\r\nitself is concerned, while an equal rise of the bottom beneath 200\r\nfathoms of water, or an equal subsidence of land 500 feet high, would\r\nbe attended by more striking consequences. It follows that the changes\r\neffected by diastrophism are much more obvious along coasts than in the\r\ndeep seas. Emergence or submergence shifts the zones of aggradation\r\nand degradation, shifts the zone of contact of ocean and land, and\r\nchanges the region concerned from one appropriate for sea life to one\r\nappropriate for terrestrial forms, or _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nOver the continental shelves the water is shallow and the bottom\r\nrelatively smooth. If a coastal region be elevated evenly, or if the\r\nsea-level be drawn down, the new shore-line on the smooth surface of\r\nthe former submerged shelf will be relatively regular, even though the\r\ncoast was notably irregular before the change. Thus in Fig. 297 the\r\ncoast-line is notably irregular. A sea-withdrawal or a land-uplift of\r\n120 feet would change the coast-line to the position of the 20-fathom\r\nline, when it would be notably less irregular than now. If it were\r\nshifted to the 100-fathom line, few irregularities would remain. In so\r\nfar as new coast-lines formed by the lowering of the sea (or rise of\r\nthe crust) depart from straightness, it is usually by broad, smooth\r\ncurves. Local uplifts of coastal lands, and especially uplifts along\r\naxes normal to the trend of the coast, would give rise to projections\r\nof land, and so to coastal irregularities; but such uplifts are rarely\r\nso localized as to give origin to minor projections. It follows that\r\nrising coasts, and those which have recently risen, or more likely,\r\ncoasts along which the sea-level is sinking or has recently sunk,\r\nare likely to be regular so far as details of outline are concerned.\r\nSubsidence of a coast-line (or rise of the sea-level) tends to the\r\nopposite results, for in this case the sea advances on a surface which\r\nhas more or less relief, and the water takes possession of every\r\ndepression brought to its level. The lower parts of the valleys are\r\nconverted into bays, the length and width of which depend on the slope\r\nand width of the valleys drowned. The numerous bays at the debouchures\r\nof the streams along the Atlantic coast of the United States, from Long\r\nIsland Sound to Carolina, such as the Delaware, Chesapeake, (Fig. 297)\r\nand numerous smaller bays, are the results of recent sinking, which\r\nhas allowed the sea to invade the lower ends of river valleys. The\r\nragged coast of Maine is another example, though glaciation as well as\r\nsubsidence has been operative here. From the present configuration of\r\ncoast-lines, it has been inferred that the present is, on the whole, an\r\nera of continental depression.[145] River valleys, the lower ends of\r\nwhich are embayed, are sometimes found to be continuous with submerged\r\nvalleys beyond the coast-line (Fig. 298). Submerged river valleys show\r\nthat the surface in which they lie was once land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 297.—Sketch of the eastern coast of the United\r\n  States from Cape May to Cape Henry, showing coastal irregularities.\r\n  The figures represent the depths of water in fathoms. (From charts of\r\n  C. and G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 298.—Sketch of Carmel Bay, Cal. The contours\r\n  below sea-level show a deep submerged channel. (From charts of C. and\r\n  G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nBays may be developed by local subsidence as well as by the submerging\r\nof valleys, though decisive examples are not readily cited. Bays may\r\nalso be produced by uplift of the surface on either side of an area\r\nwhich does not change its level. For example, uplift on either side of\r\nthe Gulf of California has probably been one element, though probably\r\nnot the only one, in the development of this indentation. The general\r\noutline of a great bay produced by coastal warping might be regular,\r\nthough it would be likely to be marked by small irregularities where\r\nthe streams enter. It is not to be understood that all, or even most,\r\nbays are due to local diastrophism.\r\n\r\nDiastrophism, then, as it affects the ocean-bottoms and the\r\nocean-borders, may make the water of any ocean shallower or deeper; it\r\nmay cause the emergence or submergence of land; it may make coast-lines\r\nregular or irregular; it may shift the habitat of life, and through\r\nthese changes may greatly influence the processes of gradation, which\r\nare especially active along the contact of sea and land.\r\n\r\n=Vulcanism= affects the sea-bottom much as it affects the land. At the\r\nvolcanic centers, where the great body of extruded matter accumulates,\r\nmounds and mountains are built up. Most of the mountain peaks of the\r\nsea-bottom, whether their crests are islands, or whether they are\r\nwholly submerged, have had a volcanic origin. The rock material ejected\r\nfrom submarine vents is probably less widely distributed than that\r\nfrom vents on land, and so far forth, the volcanic cones in the oceans\r\nare steeper than those on land. Where volcanic cones are built up near\r\nthe surface of the sea, they often furnish a home for shallow-water\r\nlife, such as polyps. Wherever built up so as to be within the reach of\r\nwaves, gradational processes are stimulated.\r\n\r\nThe processes of vulcanism do not commonly influence coasts of\r\ncontinents directly, for few volcanoes lie immediately on coasts.\r\nIn places, however, as at various points in and about Italy, the\r\nconfiguration of the coast is influenced by the building of volcanoes.\r\nIndirectly, vulcanism influences the shape of coast-lines, for the\r\nresistance of igneous rock is often different from that of the rock\r\nwith which it is associated, and under the influences of the forces of\r\ngradation it may come to form projecting points or reëntrants, as the\r\ncase may be.\r\n\r\nThe number of active volcanoes on islands is about 200, or about\r\ntwo-thirds of all now known. Since the area of the sea is about three\r\ntimes that of the land, the known active volcanoes in the sea are\r\nrather less numerous per unit area than those on the land. The number\r\nof active vents beneath the sea is altogether unknown. A few submarine\r\neruptions have been observed, and those observed are probably but a\r\nsmall percentage of those which have taken place in historic time.\r\nSlight eruptions in deep water might not manifest themselves at the\r\nsurface in an unequivocal way, even were observers stationed near them.\r\nVolcanic cones which fail to reach the surface are known, and the forms\r\nof many sea-bottom mountain peaks are such as to make it probable that\r\nthey are volcanic. These phenomena, as well as the numerous volcanic\r\nislands, give some indication of the importance of submarine eruptions\r\nin past time.\r\n\r\nOcean volcanoes, and especially submarine volcanoes, affect both the\r\ntemperature and the composition of the sea-water. Both the increase of\r\ntemperature and the solution of volcanic gases increase the capacity of\r\nthe water for mineral matter, and both the change in temperature and\r\ncomposition affect the life of the adjacent waters. The destruction\r\nof life during eruptions occasions the generation of the products of\r\norganic decomposition, and these stimulate further chemical changes.\r\nThe diffusion of affected waters occasions chemical changes wherever\r\nthey go. The effects of oceanic volcanoes on the sea-water are,\r\ntherefore, appreciable, when long periods of time are considered. The\r\ndeposition of the finer parts of volcanic discharges will be considered\r\nin connection with the deposits of the deep sea.\r\n\r\n=Gradation.=—The gradational processes of the land and the sea are\r\nin striking contrast. On the land, degradation predominates, and\r\naggradation is subordinate. In the sea, aggradation predominates, and\r\ndegradation is subordinate. On the land, degradation is, on the whole,\r\ngreatest where the land is highest, while aggradation is of consequence\r\nonly where the land is low, or where steep slopes give place to gentle\r\nones. In the sea, degradation is virtually confined to shallow water,\r\nor to what might be called the highlands of the sea, while aggradation\r\nis nearly universal, but most considerable in shallow water, or\r\nwhere shallow water gives place to deep. Both the degradational and\r\naggradational work of the sea are greatest near its shores. Opposed as\r\nthe gradational work of the land and sea are, they yet tend to a common\r\nend—the leveling of the surface of the lithosphere.\r\n\r\nThe gradational processes which affect the sea-bottom may be divided\r\ninto three categories: (1) Those effected by mechanical means, (2)\r\nthose effected by chemical means, and (3) those effected by organic\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical work of gradation in the sea is effected chiefly by the\r\nmovements of the water, and, very subordinately, by the movements of\r\nthe ice which the water carries. The results of these movements may be\r\ndegradational wherever the water is sufficiently shallow for the motion\r\nto affect the bottom. Elsewhere it is aggradational.\r\n\r\nThe direct gradational work effected by chemical means is likewise\r\npartly degradational and partly aggradational. If at any time or\r\nplace the water becomes supersaturated with any mineral substance,\r\nprecipitation takes place, and the precipitate accumulates as sediment\r\non the bottom. This sometimes happens in lagoons and other small\r\ninclosures, and perhaps in open water. On the other hand, wherever\r\nsolution is effected, degradation is the result. Solution is most\r\nimportant where the bottom consists of relatively soluble rock, such as\r\nlime carbonate.\r\n\r\nOrganic agencies are, on the whole, aggradational. Accumulations of\r\ncoral, coral débris, shells, etc., help to build up the sea-bottom,\r\nand most rapidly in shallow water where the proper forms of life are\r\nmost abundant. Here also should be mentioned the accumulations of\r\ncarbonaceous matter, especially in the form of plant bodies. In the\r\naggradation effected directly by organic agencies, the sea is passive.\r\nIts only part is to support the life which gives rise to the solid\r\nmatter, and incidentally to float a part of it in its currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MOVEMENTS OF THE SEA-WATER.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the sea-water fall into several categories. There is\r\n(1) a general circulation of sea-water, determined chiefly by three\r\nfactors: differences in density in the sea-water, differences of level,\r\nand the general movements of the atmosphere; (2) periodic movements\r\nwhich are not primarily circulatory, brought about by the attraction\r\nof the sun and moon; and (3) aperiodic movements, due to occasional\r\ncauses, such as earthquakes, volcanic explosions, landslides, etc.,\r\nwhich determine local and temporary movements, often of exceptional\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n=Differences in density and their results.=—Differences in density\r\nresult from differences in temperature and salinity. Temperature alone\r\nconsidered, water would be densest where it is coldest, namely in\r\nthe polar regions. Differences in salinity result from differences\r\nin evaporation and from inequalities in the supply of fresh water.\r\nEvaporation alone considered, the sea-water should be densest where\r\nevaporation is greatest; but the equatorial region, where evaporation\r\nis greatest, is also a region where precipitation is heavy, and\r\nprecipitation, by freshening the water, opposes the effect of great\r\nevaporation. The greatest differences in density due to the unequal\r\nsupply of fresh water are to be found near the borders of continents,\r\nwhere the precipitation on the land is discharged into the sea. In\r\nthe polar regions, the great supply of fresh water, especially during\r\nthe season when the ice is melting, opposes the effect of the low\r\ntemperature, so far as the density of the water is concerned. The\r\nresult of the operation of these factors affecting the density of the\r\nsea-water is to insure a general circulation, directed to the end\r\nof equalizing the densities; and since the disturbing factors are\r\nconstantly in operation, equilibrium is never established, and the\r\nmovements of the water are perpetual.\r\n\r\nThe pressure gradients resulting from differences of density are so\r\nslight that the resulting movements are scarcely more than a creep of\r\nthe waters. In general they are far too slow to be of importance in\r\ngradational work; but the earth’s rotation deflects the creeping waters\r\nand tends to concentrate the equator-ward movement into currents on\r\nthe east sides of the continents, and the pole-ward movement on the\r\nwest sides. In favorable situations these currents may be competent to\r\nproduce sensible mechanical results. Even where this is not the case\r\nthe circulation helps to equalize the temperatures of the sea, and so\r\nof the air above and of the land about. Indirectly, therefore, the\r\ncirculation of the ocean-waters affects every geological process which\r\nis sensitive to climate.\r\n\r\n=Differences in level and their results.=—While the surface of the\r\nocean is the common datum plane to which elevations and depressions\r\nare referred, it is to be remembered that the sea has “a very\r\ncomplicated undulating surface in consequence of the attraction which\r\nthe heterogeneous and elevated portions of the lithosphere exercise on\r\nthe liquid hydrosphere. In the opinion of geodesists, the geoid may in\r\nsome places depart from the figure of the spheroid by 1000 feet.”[146]\r\nThese variations in level would, however, not occasion circulation. The\r\ndifferences in level which determine circulation are much more trivial.\r\nEvery stream which pours fresh water into the sea tends to raise the\r\nlevel of the water where it enters. The waters brought to the ocean by\r\nthe Amazon, the Mississippi, and other great rivers would appreciably\r\nchange the level of the sea at their debouchures, if the excess did\r\nnot promptly flow away. The ready mobility of the water, however,\r\nprevents its accumulation, and the discharge of every stream generates\r\nwidespread movement. This movement is strongest at the debouchure, and\r\nweakens with increasing distance from it, though in the case of great\r\nstreams, such as the Amazon, the movement is traceable, by means of the\r\nsediment which the water carries, hundreds of miles out to sea.\r\n\r\nChanges of level are also brought about by the winds, which pile up\r\nwater along the shore against which they blow. The level of the water\r\nis said to have risen 24 feet at Calcutta on October 5, 1864, as the\r\nresult of a severe storm. While this is exceptional, a rise of 2\r\nfeet is not rare. This piling up of the waters along shore insures a\r\ncompensating movement (undertow, littoral currents, etc.) in some other\r\ndirection. Unequal evaporation and precipitation likewise disturb the\r\nlevel of the sea and occasion movement. In the open sea the movements\r\ngenerated by differences of level, like those generated by differences\r\nof density, are chiefly slow, creeping movements, but movements which\r\nnever cease. In bays and gulfs, on the other hand, the surface of the\r\nwater may be so raised, either as the result of wind, river discharge,\r\nor heavy precipitation, as to give rise to strong outward currents.\r\nThere is little doubt at the present time that the Gulf Stream owes its\r\norigin primarily to the difference of level between the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand the Atlantic.[147]\r\n\r\n=Movements generated by winds.=—The circulation resulting from the\r\ntendency of the winds to change the level of the sea-water has already\r\nbeen mentioned, but the wind also works in other ways. Where the winds\r\nhave a somewhat constant direction and are at the same time strong,\r\nthey determine a general movement of the surface-waters in their own\r\ndirection, the surface-water being dragged along at a rate somewhat\r\nless than that of the wind itself. The constant trades appear to be\r\nthe chief generators of the equatorial ocean-currents. Once generated,\r\nthese currents may be concentrated and their courses modified. The\r\ncurrents generated by trades are turned north and south when directed\r\nagainst a continent; they are modified by the configuration of the\r\nbottom if the water be shallow, and always and everywhere, except, at\r\nthe equator, they are deflected by the rotation of the earth, in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere to the right, and in the southern to the left. The\r\npole-ward currents generated in the equatorial region by the trades,\r\nand directed by the winds, the lands, the configuration of the bottom,\r\nand the rotation of the earth, determine compensating currents from\r\nhigh latitudes to low, and the same influences which control the course\r\nof the former direct the latter as well.\r\n\r\nSince the atmospheric movements are so far constant that there is a\r\nprevailing direction of winds in all latitudes, the winds, as well\r\nas differences of density and differences of level, insure a general\r\nand continual circulation of sea-water. The geological effects of\r\nthis circulation are direct and indirect; direct, by gradation of the\r\nbottom over which they flow, and indirect, by the modifications of\r\nclimate they produce. Since rotation deflects the pole-ward currents\r\nto the east sides of the oceans (west sides of the continents) and the\r\nequator-ward movements to the west sides of the oceans (east sides of\r\nthe continents), the east shores of the oceans are warmer than the west\r\nin corresponding latitudes, and the west sides of the continents are\r\nboth warmer and moister[148] than the east sides.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious disturbance of sea-water resulting from the winds is\r\nthe generation of _waves_. Waves are not primarily parts of the general\r\noceanic circulation. Since they are generated in other ways than by\r\nwinds, and since the gradational effects of waves are independent\r\nof their origin, the effects of wind-waves will not be considered\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n=Movements generated by attraction.=—One of the movements of the\r\nsea-water which is not primarily circulatory results from the\r\nattraction of the moon and sun. The tide is really the result of the\r\n_inequalities_ of the attraction of these bodies on different parts\r\nof the earth. The lunar tide is more important than the solar, not\r\nbecause the attraction of the moon is greater, for it is not, but\r\nbecause its differential attraction, the result of its lesser distance,\r\nis greater.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the moon from the earth is about 240,000 miles. If\r\nthis be taken as the distance from the center of the moon to the\r\ncenter of the earth, 236,000 and 244,000 miles respectively are the\r\ndistances from the center of the moon to the nearest and most distant\r\npoints on the earth. The distance of the sun from the earth is about\r\n93,000,000 miles. If this be taken as the distance between the centers\r\nof these bodies, then the distances from the center of the sun to the\r\nnearest and most distant points on the earth’s surface are 92,996,000\r\nand 93,004,000 miles respectively. The ratio of 4000 to 236,000 or to\r\n244,000 is much greater than the ratio of 4000 to 92,996,000 or to\r\n93,004,000. Hence the tide-producing force of the moon is greater than\r\nthat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe tides show themselves along shores in the form of waves which, in\r\nshallow water, become translatory. They differ from the wind-waves in\r\ntheir periodicity, and locally in their greater height. The effects of\r\nthe tidal waves on the shores of the sea, and on the bottom in shallow\r\nwater, are the same as the effect of wind-waves of equal strength, and\r\nneed not be separately considered in connection with the gradation of\r\nthe sea-bottom. In passing through narrow straits or narrow passes of\r\nany sort, the tidal movement becomes a current which, under favorable\r\nconditions, abrades or “scours” the bottom effectively. The tidal\r\ncurrents in the narrow passes about New York harbor may serve as an\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n=Aperiodic movements.=—In addition to the wind-waves which are\r\nessentially constant and universal, and to the tidal waves, which are\r\nperiodic, there are accidental waves which are locally and temporarily\r\nof importance. Such are earthquake-waves, which are sometimes extremely\r\ndestructive. Thus an earthquake-wave on the coast of Peru in 1746 swept\r\na frigate several miles inland and deluged Lima, seven miles from the\r\nshore. The havoc of most earthquakes affecting coasts, such as that\r\nof Lisbon in 1755, is greatly aggravated by accompanying sea-waves.\r\nEarthquake-waves differ from ordinary waves in being translatory, and\r\nso in being more effective on the bottom in deep water. Their greatest\r\nforce, however, is felt in shallow water and on shores. Volcanic\r\neruptions likewise give rise to exceptional aperiodic waves. The same\r\nis true of landslides where they affect the coast or any part of the\r\nsea-bottom. The fall of glacier ends and the capsizing of icebergs\r\nlikewise generate strong waves. To the category of exceptional waves\r\nalso belong those generated by the winds of exceptional storms, such as\r\nthat which devastated Galveston in 1900.[149]\r\n\r\n=Summary.=—From the point of view of their direct geological results\r\nin shallow water, all movements of the sea-water may be grouped into\r\ntwo main classes—(1) waves, with the undertow and the littoral currents\r\nthey generate, and (2) ocean-currents.[150]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                WAVES.\r\n\r\n=Wave-motion.=[151]—The most common waves, and from the present point\r\nof view the most important, are those generated by winds. During the\r\npassage of a wave, each particle affected by it rises and falls, and\r\nmoves forward and backward describing an orbit in a vertical plane. If\r\nthe passing wave is a swell, the orbit of the particle is closed and is\r\neither a circle or an ellipse; but in the case of a wind-wave the orbit\r\nis not closed. In such a wave two things move forward, the undulation\r\nand the water. The velocity of the undulation is relatively rapid;\r\nthat of the water, slow and rhythmic. On the crest of the wind-wave\r\neach particle of water moves forward, and in the trough it moves less\r\nrapidly backward, and the excess of the forward movement over the\r\nbackward gives it a slight residual advance. This residual advance is\r\nthe initiatory element of current. By virtue of it, the upper layer\r\nof water is carried forward with reference to the layer below, in the\r\ndirection toward which the wind blows. The waves of any considerable or\r\nlong-continued wind, therefore, generate a current tending in the same\r\ndirection as the wind.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of which waves are the superficial manifestation\r\nis not restricted to the surface, but is propagated indefinitely\r\ndownward. Near the surface the amount of motion diminishes rapidly\r\nwith increasing depth (Fig. 299), but the rate of diminution itself\r\ndiminishes, and there seems no theoretic reason for assigning any\r\ndefinite limit to the downward propagation of the oscillation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 299.—Figure illustrating the decrease in the\r\n  amount of wave-movement with increase of depth. (Fenneman.)]\r\n\r\nAt the surface, the radius of the circular orbit which a particle of\r\nwater in a wave tends to describe is half the height of the wave. At a\r\ndepth equal to one wave-length, the radius of the circle described by\r\na particle is ¹⁄₅₃₅ as great as at the surface, and at a depth equal\r\nto two wave-lengths, ¹⁄₃₀₀₀₀₀. If the height of a wave be 43 feet, the\r\nradius of the circle described by a surface particle is 21½ feet. If\r\nthe length of the wave be 300 feet, the radius of a particle at a depth\r\nof 300 feet is only about ⁴⁄₁₀ of an inch, and at 600 feet ¹⁄₁₂₀₀ of an\r\ninch.[152] These figures make it clear that effective agitation of the\r\nwater does not extend to great depths.\r\n\r\nSo long as the velocity of the wind remains constant, the velocity\r\nof the current which the wind-waves generate is less than that of\r\nthe wind, and there is always a differential movement of the water,\r\neach layer moving faster than the one beneath. The friction is thus\r\ndistributed through the whole vertical column of the water in movement,\r\nand is even borne in part by the sea-bottom if the movement extends\r\nso far down. The greater the depth, the smaller the share of the\r\nfriction each layer of water is called upon to bear, and the greater\r\nthe velocity of the current generated by a given wind. But while the\r\nwave-motion extends indefinitely downward, the lower limit of agitation\r\neffective in erosion is soon reached. Engineering operations have shown\r\nthat submarine structures are little disturbed at depths of five\r\nmeters in the Mediterranean and eight meters in the Atlantic.[153] On\r\nthe other hand, débris as coarse as gravel, which is transported by\r\nrolling on the bottom, is not infrequently carried out to depths of\r\n50 feet, and sometimes even to 150 feet. Fine sediment, like silt, is\r\ndisturbed at still greater depths, for ripple-marks, which indicate\r\nagitation of the water, are said to have been found at depths of 100\r\nfathoms.[154]\r\n\r\nWhen a wave approaches a shelving shore, its habit is changed. The\r\nvelocity of the undulation is diminished, while the velocity of the\r\nadvancing particle of water in the crest is increased; the wave-length,\r\nmeasured from trough to trough, is diminished, and the wave-height is\r\nincreased; the crest becomes acute, with the front steeper than the\r\nback, and these changes culminate in the breaking of the crest, when\r\nthe undulation proper ceases. Waves of a given height break in about\r\nthe same depth of water, and the line along which incoming waves break\r\nis the line of _breakers_. The line of breakers is in deeper water and\r\nfarther from shore when the waves are strong than when they are weak.\r\nWaves are reported to have broken in 100 fathoms of water,[155] but\r\nthis must be regarded as very exceptional. The return of the water\r\nthrown forward in the crests of waves is accomplished by a current\r\nalong the bottom called the _undertow_. The undertow is sensibly normal\r\nto the coast when uninfluenced by oblique waves, and is efficient in\r\nremoving the products of erosion.\r\n\r\nSince the incoming wave affects water which is at the same time under\r\nthe influence of the undertow, it gives to that current a pulsating\r\ncharacter, for the wave-motion sometimes supports and sometimes\r\nopposes the undertow, and thus endows it with a higher transporting\r\npower than belongs to its mean velocity. Near the breaker-line, the\r\noscillations communicated by the wave may momentarily overcome and\r\neven reverse the movement of the undertow. Inside the breaker-line,\r\nirregular oscillation only is communicated. The broken wave-crest,\r\ndashing forward, overcomes the undertow and throws it back, and the\r\nwater returns as a simple current descending a slope. The power of the\r\nundertow diminishes rapidly from the breaker-line outward as the depth\r\nof the water increases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 300.—Diagram showing relative directions of wave,\r\n  undertow, and shore-current.]\r\n\r\nWhen waves advance on the shore obliquely, a shore-current is developed\r\nas illustrated by Fig. 300, where _ab_ represents the direction of the\r\nincoming wave, _bc_ the direction of the littoral current, and _bd_ the\r\ndirection of the undertow. Where they strike the borders of land, the\r\nwind-waves, therefore, generate two other movements, the undertow and\r\nthe littoral current. Any particle of water near shore may be affected\r\nby any two or by all three of these movements at the same moment. The\r\neffect of littoral current and undertow is to give a particle of water\r\non which both are working a direction between the two, as _be_. The\r\neffect of other combinations can be readily inferred. These various\r\ncombinations are of consequence in the transportation of débris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WORK OF THE WAVES.\r\n\r\n                              _Erosion._\r\n\r\nThe general effects of the waves and the other movements to which\r\nthey give rise along shores are (1) the wear of the shores; (2) the\r\ntransportation for greater or less distances of the products of wear;\r\nand (3) the deposition of the transported materials.\r\n\r\n=By waves and undertow.=—In the dash of the waves against the shore,\r\nthe chief wear is effected by the impact of the water and of the débris\r\nwhich the water carries. Lesser results are accomplished in other ways.\r\n\r\nWhen the land at the margin of the water consists of unconsolidated\r\nmaterial, or of fragmental material but slightly cemented, the impact\r\nof the water is sufficient to displace or erode it. If weak rock be\r\nassociated with resistant rock within the zone of wave-work, the\r\nremoval of the former may lead to the disruption and fall of the\r\nlatter, especially when weak rock is washed out from beneath the\r\nstrong. The impact of the water is competent also to break up and\r\nremove rock which was once resistant, but which has been superficially\r\nweakened by changes of temperature. Rock affected by numerous open\r\njoints is likewise attacked with success, for by the dash of the waves\r\nthe blocks between the joints may be loosened and literally quarried\r\nout. It may, however, be doubted whether the dash of waves of clear\r\nwater, even when their force is many tons to the square foot, has any\r\nappreciable power to wear rock which is thoroughly solid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 301.—Angular blocks of rock which have fallen\r\n  from the cliff above, as a result of undercutting by the waves.\r\n  Grand Island, Lake Champlain. The rock is Black River limestone.\r\n  Although from the shore of a lake instead of the sea, the principles\r\n  illustrated are the same. (Perry.)]\r\n\r\nThe impact of the waves is generally reinforced and made effective\r\nby the impact of the detritus they carry. The sand, the pebbles, and\r\nsuch stones as the waves can move are used as weapons of attack, being\r\nturned against one another and against the shore. Masses of rock too\r\nlarge for the waves to move (Fig. 301) are worn by the detritus\r\n\r\ndriven back and forth over them, and in time reduced to movable\r\ndimensions (Fig. 302). They then become the tools of the waves, and in\r\nuse, are reduced to smaller and smaller size. Thus bowlders are reduced\r\nto cobbles, cobbles to pebbles, pebbles to sand, and sand to silt.\r\nThe silt is readily held in suspension in agitated water, and thus is\r\ncarried out beyond the range of breakers, and settles in water so deep\r\nas not to be effectively agitated to its bottom. Thus one generation\r\nof bowlders after another is worn out, and the comminuted products are\r\ncarried out from the immediate shore and deposited in deeper water.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of waves, whether they work by impact of water alone,\r\nor by impact of water and detritus, is dependent on their strength\r\nand on the concentration of their blows.[156] The strength of waves\r\nis dependent on the strength of the winds (or other generating cause)\r\nand the depth and expanse of the water, and the concentration of\r\ntheir blows is conditioned by the slope against which they break. On\r\nexposed ocean-coasts the fetch of the waves is always great. The winds\r\nare variable. For a given coast they have an average strength, but\r\nthe effectiveness of wave-erosion is determined less by the average\r\nstrength of waves than by the strength of the storm-waves. This is\r\noften very great. On the Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Britain,\r\nwinter breakers which exert a pressure of three tons per square\r\nfoot are not infrequent.[157] So great is the force of exceptional\r\nstorm-waves that blocks of rock exceeding 100 tons in weight are\r\nknown to have been moved by them. Ground-swells, “even when no wind\r\nis blowing, often cover the cliffs of north Scotland with sheets of\r\nwater and foam up to heights of 100 or even nearly 200 feet. During\r\nnortheasterly gales the windows of the Dunnet Head lighthouse, at\r\na height of upwards of 300 feet above high-water mark, are said\r\nto be sometimes broken by stones swept up the cliffs by sheets of\r\nsea-water.”[158] The average force of waves on the Atlantic coast of\r\nBritain has been found to be 611 lbs. per square foot in summer, and\r\n2086 lbs. in winter.[159]\r\n\r\nWhere deep water extends up to the shore, the force of the wave is\r\nalmost wholly expended near the water line; where shallow water borders\r\nthe land, the force of the waves is expended over a greater area.\r\nWaves are, therefore, most efficient on bold coasts bordered by broad\r\nexpanses of deep water.\r\n\r\nThe less familiar phases of wave-work are accomplished by hydraulic\r\npressure, compressed air, the use of ice, etc. When the water of a\r\nwave is driven into an open joint or a cave, the hydraulic pressure\r\nis great, and if the structure be weak, the rock may be broken. When\r\nwater is driven with force into a cave, the compression of the air\r\nmay be great if the wave be high enough to close the entrance. When\r\nthe water runs out of a cave, the air within may be greatly rarefied,\r\nwhile that above exerts its normal pressure. In either case the roof\r\nof the cave, if it be weak, may be broken. At certain seasons of the\r\nyear, especially during the spring, waves make destructive use of the\r\nice which is then breaking up, but it is only in high latitudes that\r\nsea-ice is of consequence in this way. In general, the effect of its\r\npresence in keeping down waves overbalances its effect as an agent of\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 302.—Showing blocks similar to those of Fig. 306,\r\n  reduced and rounded by wave-action. Shore of Lake Champlain. The rock\r\n  is Utica shale. (Perry.)]\r\n\r\nThe direct effect of wave-erosion is restricted to a zone which is\r\nnarrow both horizontally and vertically. There is no impact of breakers\r\nat levels lower than the troughs of the waves, though erosion may\r\nextend down to the limit of effective agitation (p. 341). The efficient\r\nimpact of waves is limited upward by the level of the wave-crests,\r\nalthough the dash of the water produces feebler blows at higher levels.\r\nThe rise and fall of the water during the flow and ebb of the tides\r\ngives the waves a greater vertical range than wind-waves alone would\r\nhave. The vertical zone of direct wave-work is therefore limited above\r\nby the level of wave-crests, and below by the depth of wave-troughs\r\n(nearly). The indirect work of waves is limited only by the height\r\nof the shore, for as the zone of excavation is carried landward,\r\nmasses higher up the slope are undermined and fall. The fallen rock\r\ntemporarily protects the shore against the waves, but are themselves\r\neventually broken up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 303.—Diagram illustrating high sea-cliffs. It\r\n  also shows a submerged terrace, due partly to wave-cutting (wave-cut\r\n  terrace), and partly to building (wave-built terrace). (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 304.—Diagram showing a low sea-cliff. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\nThe pulsating current of the undertow (p. 341) has both an erosive and\r\na transporting function. It carries the detritus of the shore to and\r\nfro, and dragging it over the bottom, continues downward the erosion\r\ninitiated by the breakers. This downward erosion is the necessary\r\nconcomitant of the shoreward progress of wave-erosion; for, if the\r\nland were merely planed away to the level of the wave-troughs, the\r\nincoming waves would break where shoal water was first reached, and\r\nbecome ineffective at the water margin. The rate of erosion by the\r\nundertow becomes less and less as the surface it affects is lowered.\r\nLittoral currents do little erosive work beyond that inflicted on the\r\nmaterial which they transport.\r\n\r\nThe general result of wave-erosion is the advance of the sea on the\r\nland, the rate of advance being determined chiefly by the nature of the\r\nmaterial attacked and the strength of the waves. Numerous as examples\r\nare of the retreat of coast-lines before the advance of the sea, it\r\nis not to be understood that the advance of the sea on the land is\r\nuniversal or uninterrupted. Numerous instances may be cited of the\r\nencroachment of the land on the sea. At Long Branch the advance of the\r\nsea, in spite of elaborate breakwaters, has been so rapid in recent\r\nyears as to menace important buildings, while a few miles to the north\r\nand south, the land is advancing in the face of the waves. The low\r\ncoast of the Middle Netherlands has retreated two miles or more in\r\nhistoric times,[160] but the opposite tendency is shown at other points\r\nin the same region. On the coast of England the sites of villages have\r\ndisappeared by the advance of the sea within historic times,[161] but\r\nthe coast of the same island affords illustrations of land advance. On\r\nthe south side of Nantucket island, the sea-cliff has been known to\r\nretreat before the waves as much as six feet in a single year.[162]\r\nAlmost every considerable stretch of coast affords illustrations both\r\nof the advance of the sea on the land and of land on the sea; but in\r\nthe long run, the former must exceed the latter, diastrophic movements\r\naside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 305.—Steep cliff developed by waves.

West\r\n  shore of Random Sound, south of Clarenville, N. F. (Walcott, U. S.\r\n  Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=The sea-cliff.=—The action of the waves, cutting as they do along\r\na definite horizontal zone, has been compared to the action of a\r\nhorizontal saw. As the waves cut into the shore at and near the\r\nwater-level, the material above, being unsupported, falls, leaving a\r\nsteep face above the line of cutting. This steep face is known as _the\r\nsea-cliff_ (Figs. 301 to 306). The same term is sometimes applied to\r\nthe cliffs of lakes. The principles involved in the development of the\r\nsea-cliff are applicable to any broad stretch of water.\r\n\r\nThe height of the cliff depends on the height of the land on which\r\nthe sea is advancing. Its slope may be steep or gentle (compare Figs.\r\n303 to 306), according to the nature of the material of which it is\r\ncomposed and the rapidity of the cutting. Rapid cutting tends to\r\nproduce steep cliffs and slow cutting gentle ones, for in the latter\r\ncase weathering is more important relative to the cutting, and at\r\nsea-level (low altitudes) weathering generally tends to reduce the\r\nangle of slope. In general, the more resistant the material the steeper\r\nthe slope of the cliff. Incoherent materials, such as sand and clay,\r\nare not likely to form steep cliffs; but if the cutting be very rapid,\r\nbold faces may be developed even in such materials (Fig. 307). If beds\r\nof slight resistance at sea-level underlie beds of greater resistance,\r\nthe development of steep cliffs is favored. The structure of the\r\ncliff-rock also has an influence on the slope. The rock may be massive\r\nor bedded. If bedded, the beds may be horizontal, or they may dip at\r\nany angle, in any direction. The rock, whether stratified or not, may\r\nbe abundantly or sparsely jointed. All these structures influence the\r\nslope and configuration of the sea-cliff (see Figs. 305 to 308).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 309.—“Old Man of Hoy.” (Geikie.)]\r\n\r\n=Chimney-rocks, etc.=—By working in along the joints of the rock,\r\nwidening them and quarrying out the intervening blocks, pillars of\r\nrock (“chimney-rocks,” “pulpit-rocks”) or even considerable islets are\r\nsometimes isolated by the waves. This is most readily accomplished\r\nwhere the joints converge back from the shore. A well-known example\r\nof this sort is the “Old Man of Hoy” (Fig. 309) on the coast of the\r\nOrkneys. A pulpit-rock or other island, or any jutting point of\r\nrock may be pierced, giving an arch or bridge. La Roche Percée, a\r\nsteep-faced isle near Gaspé Harbor, is an example.\r\n\r\n=Sea-caves.=—Waves sometimes excavate caves at the bases of cliffs.\r\nThis is especially likely to occur where the rock is much jointed and\r\nwhere the joints are not continued to the surface in a single plane.\r\nThe bottom and roof of a sea-cave usually have a pronounced inclination\r\nlandward. If the cliff be low, the cave may be extended landward until\r\nits roof is pierced. Through such an opening in the top of the cliff\r\nthe water of the incoming waves may be forced in the form of spray.\r\nOn the New England coast such holes are sometimes known as “spouting\r\nhorns.” Similar openings may be made, as already pointed out, by the\r\ncompression or rarefaction of the air in the cave as the wave enters or\r\nretreats. If the roof of the cave be partially destroyed, the portion\r\nwhich remains may form an arch or _bridge_. Such a bridge occurs on\r\nSanta Cruz Island, California (Fig. 310).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 310.—An arch developed by waves. Santa Cruz\r\n  Island, Cal. (Law.)]\r\n\r\nThe cave, the “spouting horn,” the “bridge,” the “pulpit-rock,” and\r\nother isolated islets, are all closely associated with the sea-cliff in\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n=The wave-cut terrace.=—The bottom of the sea-cliff is bordered by a\r\nsubmerged platform over which the water is shallow. This platform,\r\nor at any rate its landward portion, represents the area over which\r\nthe water has advanced as the result of wave-cutting, and is,\r\ntherefore, known as the _wave-cut terrace_. From the method of cliff\r\ndevelopment it will be seen that the wave-cut terrace is its necessary\r\naccompaniment. Such a terrace has a gentle slope to seaward, for its\r\nouter and older edge has been degraded longer and more. Its slope is\r\ninfluenced by the strength of the waves, being greater where they are\r\nstronger. The outer edge of the wave-cut terrace is often marked by\r\nan abrupt descent. Fig. 303 represents the wave-cut terrace in its\r\nrelation to the sea-cliff above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 311.—An elevated cliff above Great Salt Lake.\r\n  In this case the water-level has been lowered. (Gilbert, U. S. Geol.\r\n  Surv.)]\r\n\r\nSo long as wave-cut terraces are submerged, they do not appear on\r\ntopographic maps of the land, though they appear on the charts of the\r\ncoasts; but if a coastal tract with wave-cut terraces be elevated, or\r\nif the sea-level be drawn down, the terraces become land. Elevated\r\nsea-cliffs and wave-cut terraces are among the best evidences of change\r\nof relative level between water and land (Fig. 311).\r\n\r\n=Wave-erosion and horizontal configuration.=—The structure of the rock\r\nalong shore has as much to do with the horizontal configuration of\r\nthe wave-shaped coast, as with its relief. In general, waves develop\r\nreëntrants in the less resistant portions of the shore, leaving the\r\nmore resistant parts as headlands (San Pedro Point and Devil’s Slide,\r\nPl. XX, Coast of California). It is to be noted that the resistance\r\nof rock to wave-erosion is not determined by its hardness alone.\r\nEvery division plane, whether due to bedding, to jointing, or to\r\nirregular fracture, is a source of weakness to the rock, and rock\r\nof great hardness may be so broken as to offer relatively little\r\nresistance. Inequalities of resistance, whatever their cause, give\r\norigin to inequalities of coastal configuration where wave-erosion is\r\nin progress. Given a coast of marked regularity and equal exposure,\r\nbut composed of unequally resistant material, the waves will make it\r\nirregular by cutting most where the material is least resistant. A\r\nregular coast of uniform material, but unequal exposure, will be made\r\nirregular by the greater cutting at the points of greater exposure. A\r\ncoast of marked irregularity and homogeneous material will be made more\r\nregular by the cutting off of the projecting points, because they are\r\nmost exposed. With a given set of conditions, waves tend to develop\r\na certain sort of shore-line which, so far as its horizontal form is\r\nconcerned, is relatively stable. Such a shore-line may be said to be\r\n_mature_[163] so far as wave-erosion is concerned. Since coastal lands\r\nare, in general, both heterogeneous and unequally exposed, a mature\r\ncoast-line is somewhat irregular. Its maturity is attained when the\r\nlesser exposure in the reëntrants developed in the less resistant\r\nparts, balances the superior exposure of the projections of the more\r\nresistant portions.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions of erosion along coasts are constantly, even if\r\nslowly, changing, maturity is constantly being approached, but rarely\r\nreached. Other forces and processes, such as those of aggradation,\r\nvulcanism, and diastrophism, are in operation along coasts, and\r\ntheir results are sometimes antagonistic to those of the waves. The\r\nhorizontal configuration of coasts is, therefore, the result of many\r\ncoöperating forces, of which waves are but one. It is, nevertheless,\r\nimportant to note the goal to which the waves are working, even though\r\nthey are continually defeated in their attempt to reach it. Their\r\nimmediate goal is an equilibrium of erosion-rate and maturity of\r\nconfiguration; their final goal is the destruction of the land and the\r\ndeposition of its substance in the sea, that is, in a position nearer\r\nthe center of gravity of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Transportation by Waves._\r\n\r\nThe material eroded from the shore by the waves in the shaping of the\r\ncliff and terrace is carried away by the joint action of the waves,\r\nundertow, and shore-currents.\r\n\r\nThe in-coming wave begins to shift material where it begins to drag\r\nbottom, that is, a little outside the line of breakers. From the line\r\nwhere transportation begins, to the line of breakers, bottom detritus\r\nis shifted shoreward by the waves, while the undertow tends to carry it\r\nback again. Between the breakers and the shore there is also a tendency\r\nfor the on-shore movement to carry débris to the water’s edge, and for\r\nthe ebbing wave to carry it back again. The result of these opposed\r\ntendencies is to keep sediment in transit between the shore and the\r\nline of breakers. If the in-coming waves have a direction normal to the\r\nshore, the advance and recoil of the water move particles toward and\r\nfrom the shore, but effect no transfer along the shore; but the results\r\nwhich waves normal to the shore would achieve are always modified by\r\nother waves and by littoral currents.\r\n\r\nIf the in-coming wave is oblique to the shore, it shifts material in\r\nits own direction. The transfer by undertow, taken alone, would be\r\nsensibly normal to the shore, but the effect of the oblique waves is\r\nto slightly modify this direction. There is thus a slow transportation\r\nalong shore, even in the absence of steady currents. A great amount\r\nof transportation would be effected in this way, though it would\r\nbe carried on at a slow rate. Oblique waves also tend to develop a\r\ndefinite shore-current (p. 342) which affects both the amount and\r\ndirection of the transportation. Any particle in suspension, or in\r\nmotion on the bottom as the result of the wave or undertow, is shifted\r\nalong shore by the littoral current, which affects the same water\r\n(Fig. 300). By the coöperation of wave- and shore-current, more and\r\nheavier material can be moved than by either alone, and the direction\r\nof movement is more nearly parallel to the shore than that of the\r\nwave. Similarly, by the coöperation of undertow and shore-current,\r\nmore and heavier material can be moved than by either alone. The\r\ndirection of movement is readily inferred from Fig. 300. The direction\r\nin which débris is shifted by wave- and shore-current is modified by\r\nthe undertow, and the direction which would result from undertow and\r\ncurrent is modified by the wave. It is often the waves of storms,\r\nrather than those of the prevailing winds, which determine the\r\ndirection of greatest shore transportation.\r\n\r\nThe waves, the undertow, and the littoral currents work together in\r\nassorting the detritus of the shore. The coarsest parts may be beyond\r\nthe power of all but the strongest waves. They accumulate where\r\nagitation is great. Less coarse parts are shifted farther from the site\r\nof greatest agitation, but no materials which are classed as coarse\r\nare carried beyond the depth of sensible movement. The coarse material\r\nwhich covers the bottom where the agitation of the water at the bottom\r\nis effective, constitutes _shore drift_.\r\n\r\nShore drift is not all derived from the shore by the cutting of the\r\nwaves. A part of it is brought to the sea by streams and mingled with\r\nthat eroded from the cliffs. The material which is fine enough to be\r\nheld in suspension is measurably independent of depth. This is shown\r\nduring storms when the water becomes turbid far beyond the line of\r\nbreakers, and clears only after the waves have died away.\r\n\r\nThis sorting of shore drift, effected while it is in transportation, is\r\noften very perfect. The conditions favoring assortment are (1) vigorous\r\nwave-action, (2) prolonged transportation, and (3) a moderate volume of\r\nsediment.[164] The effect of these several conditions will be readily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nExtensive transportation of shore drift of a given degree of coarseness\r\nis favored by (1) strong waves and undertow, (2) continuous currents,\r\nand (3) shallow water, deepening but gradually off shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Deposition by Waves, Undertow, and Shore-currents._[165]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 312.—Cross-section of the beach. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n=The beach.=—The zone occupied by the shore drift in transit is the\r\n_beach_. The lower margin is beneath the water, a little beyond the\r\nline where the great storm-waves break. Its upper margin is at the\r\nlevel reached by storm-waves, and is usually a few feet above the level\r\nof still water. To the beach, material is brought from seaward by the\r\nin-coming waves, and from it detritus is carried out by the undertow.\r\nThe cross-section of a beach is shown in Fig. 312. In horizontal\r\nposition the beach follows the general boundary between water and land,\r\nthough it does not conform to its minor irregularities (Fig. 313). The\r\nbeach or barrier ridge often causes the deflection of the lower courses\r\nof streams descending to it (Pl. XXI).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 313.—A lake-beach (barrier); Griffin’s Bay, Lake\r\nOntario.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\n  NEW JERSEY\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. PORTION OF SOUTH COAST OF MARTHAS VINEYARD, MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR TAMALPAIS.\r\n  U S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 314.—Section of a barrier. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n=The barrier.=—When the agitation of the water along shore becomes\r\ninsufficient to carry the material, it is dropped. In its deposition it\r\nassumes various forms. Where the bottom of the lake or sea near shore\r\nhas a very gentle inclination, the in-coming waves break some distance\r\nfrom the shore-line, and it is here that the most violent agitation\r\noccurs when the waves are strong. To this line of breakers, material\r\nis shifted from both directions: from shore by undertow, and from\r\nseaward by the waves. Accumulating here, it builds up a low ridge.\r\nThis is a _barrier_ (Fig. 314). If it is built up above the surface of\r\nthe water by storm-waves, it may shut in a lagoon behind it, and this\r\nmay ultimately be filled by sediment washed down from the land. At one\r\nstage in the filling, the lagoon becomes a marsh.[166] In the part\r\nwhich the barrier plays in the history of a coast, it is identical with\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 315.—A recurved spit. Dutch Point, Grand Traverse\r\n  Bay, Lake Michigan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 316.—Cross-section of a bar. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n=The spit, the bar, and the loop.=—The disposition of shore-deposits\r\ndepends largely on the currents at and near shore. If the coast-line\r\nis deeply indented, the littoral current usually fails to follow the\r\nreëntrants. In holding its course across the mouth of a small bay,\r\na shore-current usually passes into deeper water. Here its velocity\r\nis checked because its motion is communicated to the water beneath\r\nit, and a larger amount of water being involved in the motion, the\r\nmotion of each part is diminished. If sediment was being moved along\r\nits bottom before the current was checked, some part of it is dropped\r\nwhen and where the current is slackened. It follows that deposition\r\ncommonly takes place beneath a littoral current as it crosses the\r\nmouth of a bay. The belt of deposition is often narrow, and the result\r\nis the construction of a ridge beneath the water in the direction of\r\nthe current. The current would never build the embankment up to the\r\nwater-level, but when its surface approaches the level of effective\r\nagitation, the waves may begin to work on it, as on a barrier, and\r\nmay build it up to, and even above, the surface of the water. So long\r\nas the end of such an embankment is free, it is a _spit_ (Fig. 315\r\nand Pl. XXI). If the spit be lengthened until it crosses, or nearly\r\ncrosses, the bay, shutting it off from the open water, it becomes a\r\nbar. Bars have shut in lakes (ponds) on the coast of Martha’s Vineyard,\r\nMass. (Fig. 1, Pl. XXII), and lakes and lagoons at numerous points\r\nboth on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts (Fig. 2, Pl. XXII, Rodeo\r\nlagoon). The same phenomena are to be seen along many lake shores.\r\nBars sometimes tie islands to the mainland (Pl. XXIII, Fig. 1, Nahant,\r\nMass.; Fig. 2, near Biddeford, Me.). The structure of a bar as seen in\r\ncross-section is shown in Fig. 316.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a spit has been aptly compared to the construction\r\nof a railway embankment across a depression. The material is first\r\ncarried out from the bordering upland (shallow water) and dumped where\r\nthe slope to the depression (deep water) begins. The embankment thus\r\nbegun is extended by the carrying out of new material, which is left at\r\nthe end of the dump already made.\r\n\r\nIf the bay across which the bar is built receives abundant drainage\r\nfrom the land, the outflow from the bay may be sufficient to prevent\r\nthe completion of the bar (Fig. 2, Pl. XXII), for when the growth of\r\nthe spit has sufficiently narrowed the outlet of the bay, the sediment\r\nbrought to the end of the spit by the littoral current will be swept\r\nout beyond the spit by the current setting out from the bay.\r\n\r\nThe completion of a bar may be interfered with by tidal currents, even\r\nwithout land-drainage. Currents generated by the tides may sweep in\r\nor out of the bay with increased force as the entrance is narrowed,\r\ncarrying in or out the sediment which the littoral current would have\r\nleft at the end of the spit. The scour of the tides often insures\r\ndeep entrances (inlets) to bays, and maintains definite channels or\r\n“thorofares” in the lagoon marshes behind barriers and spits. The\r\nsediment brought down from the land, as well as that washed in by tidal\r\ncurrents and waves, tends to fill up the lagoon behind a barrier, a\r\nspit, or a bar, converting it into land (Fig. 317).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 317.—Sketch of a portion of the New Jersey coast.\r\n  The dotted belt next the sea is the barrier, modified by the wind.\r\n  The area marked by the diagonal lines is the mainland. In the marshy\r\n  area between, there are numerous channels or “thorofares” kept open\r\n  by the currents. The figures show the depths of water in feet. Scale\r\n  about ⅜ inch = 1 mile.]\r\n\r\nSince spits and bars are built only where there is shore-drift in\r\ntransit, they are always built out from a beach or barrier. The distal\r\nend of the bar may also join a beach or barrier. Traced back to\r\nits source, the beach from which a spit leads out is often found to\r\nterminate in the cliff from which the material of the beach and the\r\nspit were derived (Pl. XX and Fig. 2, Pl. XXII). In such cases the\r\nsediment of the beach has been shifted but a short distance; but in\r\nother cases it has traveled far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 318.—Map of shore-terraces, largely wave-built.\r\n  Lake Bonneville. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 319.—A portion of the Texas coast showing the\r\n  tendency of shore-deposition to simplify the coast-line. The deposits\r\n  (the narrow necks of land parallel to the coast) shut in the bays.\r\n  (From chart of C. and G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 320.—Map showing that in the early stages of the\r\n  simplification of a shore-line the irregularities are increased. The\r\n  numbers indicate the depth of water in fathoms. (From chart of C. and\r\n  G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe spit is usually either straight or in conformity with the general\r\ncourse of the shore-current, but since the littoral current itself is\r\nsubject to alteration as the result of shifting winds, the spit may\r\ndepart from straightness. Winds which simply reverse the direction of\r\nthe littoral current retard its construction, but may not otherwise\r\naffect it; but if a strong current be made to flow past the end of a\r\nspit, it may cut away its extremity and rebuild the materials into a\r\nsmaller spit, joining the main one at an angle. This gives rise to a\r\n_hook_ (Fig. 315). Successive storms may develop successive hooks along\r\nthe side of a growing spit. The end of a hook may be so extended as to\r\njoin the mainland, when it becomes a _loop_.\r\n\r\n=Wave-built terraces.=—Under the influence of off-shore currents,\r\nlittoral currents may be drawn from the coast-line. If such a current\r\ncontinues as a well-defined surface-current, it builds a spit, but\r\nif it spreads, it tends to build a terrace. The accumulation then\r\nis not at the end of a beach, as in the case of a spit, but on its\r\nside, and the result of the deposition is to carry the beach seaward.\r\nThe undertow abets the process. The widened beach is a _wave-built\r\nterrace_. The wave-built terrace often borders the wave-cut terrace\r\nalong its seaward margin (Figs. 303 and 318). With the help of waves,\r\nthe surface of the terrace may be built up into land by the expansion\r\nof the crest of the beach. Terrace-cutting and terrace-building are\r\nboth involved in the development of the continental shelves.\r\n\r\nBeach ridges, spits, bars, etc., like sea-cliffs and wave-cut terraces,\r\nare often preserved after the relative level of sea and land has\r\nchanged. If the shore has risen, relatively or absolutely, these\r\nfeatures are relied on as evidences of the change. If shore features\r\nbe submerged instead of elevated, they furnish less accessible, though\r\nnot less real, evidence of the change of level. Similar features\r\nabout lakes have a like significance, but in this case it is often\r\ndemonstrable that it is the water rather than the land which has\r\nchanged its level.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Effect of Shore-deposition on Coastal Configuration._\r\n\r\nThe tendency of shore-deposition is to cut off bays and to straighten\r\nand simplify the shore-lines. This is abundantly illustrated along\r\nthe Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States (see Fig. 319 and\r\nPl. XXII). It is to be noted, however, that in the simplification of\r\nthe shore-line through deposition, the initial stages often result\r\nin great irregularity (Fig. 320 and Pl. XXIII). In some cases, the\r\nirregularities are not temporary. Thus deltas (p. 198), though\r\nnot wholly the work of sea- (or lake-) water, often constitute\r\nirregularities of a more or less permanent nature. This is the case\r\nwhere they project beyond the general trend of the coast-line. Where,\r\non the other hand, they are built at the heads of bays, they tend to\r\nsimplify the coast-line by obliterating the indentation. The delta at\r\nthe head of the Gulf of California is an example. So too is the delta\r\nof the Mississippi, the real head of which is far above the present\r\ndebouchure of the stream. The form of the delta in ground-plan depends\r\non the horizontal configuration of the coast where it is developed, on\r\nthe strength of the waves and shore-currents, and on their relation\r\nto the amount of detritus contributed by the stream concerned. Good\r\nillustrations are furnished by the Gulf of Mexico where the deltas of\r\nthe Mississippi and Rio Grande are in contrast.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the vertical configuration of coasts, erosion and\r\ndeposition are in contrast, for while the former tends to develop\r\nsteep, irregular, and often high slopes (p. 349) from the land to\r\nthe sea, the latter tends to develop gentle, regular, and low ones.\r\nA partial exception to the latter part of this general statement\r\ncomes about through the building of dunes, the material for which is\r\nfurnished by the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SUMMARY OF COASTAL IRREGULARITIES.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal irregularities of coasts are both large and small.\r\nSome of them, like Florida, Sandy Hook, etc., consist primarily of\r\nprojections of land into the sea; others, like Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, and Puget Sound, are projections of the sea into the land;\r\nwhile still others, like the Gulf of California and its associated\r\npeninsula, cannot readily be put in either of the foregoing classes.\r\nSome of the irregularities of the land border, such as Yucatan, are\r\nmore or less nearly normal to the general trend of the coast which they\r\naffect, while others, such as the “beaches” along the Atlantic and\r\nGulf coasts of the United States (Figs. 319 and 320), are more or less\r\nnearly parallel with it. Some of the irregularities, especially some of\r\nthe small ones, are more or less angular in their outline (Pl. XX and\r\nparts of Fig. 2, Pl. XXII), while others are bounded by curves instead.\r\n\r\nIn many cases more than one factor has been involved in the development\r\nof irregularities. In the case of great irregularities, diastrophism\r\nhas generally been the dominant factor. The Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nMediterranean Sea perhaps represent differential subsidence, while\r\nFlorida and the Iberian peninsula represent differential uplift\r\n(relative, though perhaps not absolute). The narrow bays which indent\r\nmany coasts generally represent the subsidence of a region previously\r\naffected by valleys (Fig. 297). Many of them, such as Narragansett,\r\nDelaware, and Chesapeake Bays, are primarily the drowned ends of\r\nriver valleys, while others, such as Puget Sound,[167] are primarily\r\nstructural valleys (synclines). Many of the long and narrow bays or\r\nfiords common in the high latitudes of North America and Europe (Fig.\r\n266, p. 293) appear to be the drowned ends of valleys previously\r\ndeepened by glaciers. The drowned ends of river canyons, and the\r\nsubmerged parts of valleys excavated (not sunk) beneath the sea by\r\nglaciers, would also be fiords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. MAINE.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\n  PORTION OF THE COAST OF MAINE.\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.]\r\n\r\nThe processes which develop coastal indentations, together with the\r\nantecedent subaërial and the subsequent wave gradation, account for\r\nmost of the islands which affect indented coasts. Some of them are\r\nhigh and some low for reasons which will be readily understood. The\r\nlong narrow belts of land constituting irregularities parallel to the\r\ngeneral trend of the coast (Figs. 319 and 320) are usually the result\r\nof deposition in shallow water. They are usually sand or coral reefs,\r\nbuilt up above water-level by waves. The deposits at the debouchures\r\nof streams give rise to projecting deltas. Most small irregularities\r\nof angular form, especially if high (Pl. XX), indicate wave-erosion,\r\nand their details of form are determined by the structure of the rock\r\nalong shore, while most irregularities of curved outline involve\r\nsomething of shore-deposition, if not due wholly to it. Glaciation, or\r\nglaciation and subsidence, may also give rise to peninsulas, capes, and\r\nislands of curved outlines (Pl. XXIV, coast of Maine). Curving outlines\r\nmay, however, be developed by erosion alone in weak rock structures.\r\nThis is illustrated by the weak rock structures (clay, sand, etc.) of\r\nmost of the Atlantic coastal plain. Thus inspection of the horizontal\r\nconfiguration of coasts will often indicate the processes which\r\nhave been dominant there in recent times. On the other hand, the\r\ninterpretations of many coastal irregularities, such as Hudson Bay,\r\nPuget Sound, the Gulf of California, the Baltic Sea, etc., are not to\r\nbe read from the map. In such cases, diastrophism and gradation have\r\nusually coöperated, but the relative importance of the two processes\r\ncan only be determined by detailed study in the field. When it is\r\nremembered that the tendency of shore-erosion is to reduce great\r\nirregularities of horizontal configuration, though not to obliterate\r\nsmall ones if the coast be heterogeneous in composition (p. 353), and\r\nthat the tendency of shore-deposition is also to regularity, it is\r\nclear that the great irregularities of coast-lines are due neither to\r\nshore-erosion nor to shore-deposition, though minor ones may be due to\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE WORK OF OCEAN-CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nAs agents of erosion, ocean-currents are not, in general, of great\r\nimportance. Currents which reach the bottom are comparable, in\r\ntheir effects, to rivers of the same velocity and volume; but most\r\nocean-currents do not touch bottom, and, therefore, do not erode it.\r\nWhere the current agitates the bottom sensibly, as it often does in\r\nshallow water, the bottom is abraded, and in the lee of such places\r\nit is doubtless aggraded. Since ocean-currents do not, for the most\r\npart, flow in shallow water, their erosive work is, on the whole,\r\nrelatively slight; but where they are forced through narrow and shallow\r\npassageways, their abrasive work may be considerable. Thus the Gulf\r\nStream, where it issues from the Gulf, has a velocity of four or five\r\nmiles per hour, and its shallow and narrow channel is current-swept.\r\n\r\nA rough test of the abrasive work of an ocean-current is found in the\r\nnature of the bottom beneath it. If this be hard, it indicates that the\r\nloose sediment on the floor of the ocean has been swept away, while the\r\npresence of fine detritus indicates that the current is not wearing.\r\nThus the abrasive power of the Gulf Stream is known to continue\r\nsomewhat beyond its narrow channel, for on the Blake plateau (between\r\nthe Bahamas and Cape Hatteras), where the water is 600 fathoms and less\r\nin depth, “the bottom of the Gulf Stream ... is swept clean of lime and\r\nooze and is nearly barren of animal life.”[168] Other illustrations\r\nof the erosive power of currents have been noted near Gibraltar in\r\nwater 500 fathoms deep, and between the Canary Islands at depths of\r\n1000 fathoms.[169] In spite of these examples, and of many others\r\nwhich probably exist in similar situations, it yet remains true that\r\nocean-currents are on the whole but feeble agents of erosion.\r\n\r\nAs agents of transportation, ocean-currents are scarcely more important\r\nthan as agents of corrasion, for they transport only what they erode,\r\nif the life which inhabits them be left out of consideration. This\r\nphase of their work has probably been exaggerated through a confusion\r\nof transporting energy and actual transportation. Ocean-currents which\r\ndo not touch bottom roll no sediment and carry only what may be held\r\nin suspension. A river’s power of transporting sediment in suspension\r\nis due largely to the cross-currents occasioned by the unevenness of\r\nits resistant bottom (p. 117). If a particle of mud in suspension in\r\na river drops to the bottom, as it frequently does, it may be picked\r\nup again and carried forward. If, on the other hand, a particle in\r\nsuspension in an ocean-current once escapes the moving water by\r\nsettling through it, the current which does not drag bottom has no\r\nchance to pick it up again. Very fine sediment may be carried by an\r\nocean-current far beyond the point where it was acquired, but currents\r\nwhich do not touch bottom are rarely strong enough to hold any but the\r\nfinest material for any considerable length of time. As transporters\r\nof sediment, therefore, ocean-currents are at a great disadvantage as\r\ncompared with rivers.\r\n\r\nHow readily particles of extreme fineness may be kept in suspension,\r\nand how little agitation is necessary to keep them from sinking, is\r\nshown by the experiments of Sorby, who showed that while a sand grain\r\n¹⁄₁₀₀ of an inch in diameter will settle one foot per second in still\r\nwater, fine particles of clay require days to sink through the same\r\ndistance. The Challenger found fine sediment derived from the land 400\r\nmiles from the coast of Africa, and that not opposite the debouchure of\r\nany large river. Sediment settles more readily in salt water than in\r\nfresh, despite the fact that the former is heavier. This is presumably\r\nbecause the salt diminishes the cohesion of the water.\r\n\r\nDeposition by ocean-currents is limited by their transportation. Only\r\nwhere they erode their bottoms do they gather coarse materials, and\r\nonly in the lee of such places are their deposits coarse. Since the\r\nmaterial which they carry is generally fine, it is widely distributed\r\nbefore deposition.\r\n\r\nOcean-currents have little influence on the configuration of\r\ncoast-lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DEPOSITS ON THE OCEAN-BED.\r\n\r\nSomething has already been said concerning the sediments which\r\naccumulate in the shallow waters along shores; but the area of marine\r\nsedimentation is as extensive as the ocean itself, and the deposits\r\nmust now be reviewed from another point of view.\r\n\r\nOceanic deposits may be conveniently divided into two chief groups,\r\ndependent on the depth of the water in which they are made.[170] These\r\ngroups are (1) _shallow-water deposits_, made in water less than some\r\nsuch depth as 100 fathoms, and (2) _deep-sea deposits_, laid down in\r\nwater of greater depth. The selection of the 100-fathom line as the\r\ndividing depth is less arbitrary than it seems, for passing outward\r\nfrom the shore, it is at about this depth that the bottom ceases to be\r\ncommonly disturbed by the action of currents and waves; that sunlight\r\nand vegetable life cease to be important at the bottom; and that the\r\ncoarser sediments which predominate along shore give place, as a rule,\r\nto muds and oozes. Furthermore, the 100-fathom line (or some line very\r\nnear it) is an important one in the physical relief of the globe, for\r\nit appears to mark, approximately, the junction of continental plateaus\r\nand ocean-basins. Only because the latter are a little over-full does\r\nthe water run over their rims, covering about 10,000,000 square miles\r\nof the borders of the continents, converting them from land into\r\nepicontinental seas.\r\n\r\nAside from the deposits made by organisms, shallow-water deposits are\r\ndivisible into two groups—(_a_) those immediately along the shore, the\r\n_littoral deposits_, and (_b_) those made between the littoral zone\r\nand the 100-fathom line. Both are terrigenous. The deep-sea deposits\r\nlikewise are divisible into two groups, (_a_) _terrigenous deposits_\r\nformed close to land, and made up chiefly of materials derived\r\nimmediately from the disintegration of land formations; and (_b_) the\r\n_pelagic deposits_, made up chiefly of the remains of pelagic organisms\r\nand the ultimate products arising from the decomposition of rocks and\r\nminerals. The former predominate in the less deep waters relatively\r\nnear shore; the latter in the deeper water far from land. The shallow-\r\nand deep-water deposits grade into each other in a belt along the\r\n100-fathom line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Shallow-water Deposits._\r\n\r\n=Littoral deposits.=—The littoral zone is the zone between high- and\r\nlow-water marks. It is the zone in which bowlders, gravels, sands, and\r\nall coarser materials accumulate, though muds are occasionally met\r\nwith in sheltered estuaries. Generally speaking, the nature of these\r\ndeposits is determined by the character of the adjoining lands and the\r\nnature of the local organisms. “The heavier materials brought by rivers\r\nfrom high terrestrial regions, or thrown up by the tides and waves\r\nof the sea, are here arranged with great diversity of stratification\r\nthrough the alternate play of the winds and waves. Twice in the\r\ntwenty-four hours the littoral zone is covered by water and exposed\r\nto the direct rays of the sun or the cooling effects of the night.\r\nThere is a great range of temperature; mechanical agencies produce\r\ntheir maximum effects,”[171] and physical conditions in general are\r\nmost varied. Still greater diversity is introduced by the fact that\r\nthe zone is inhabited by both marine and terrestrial organisms, while\r\nthe evaporation of the sea-water which flows over tidal marshes and\r\nlagoons leads to the formation of saline deposits. If the length of\r\nthe coast-lines of the world be taken at 125,000 miles (about 200,000\r\nkilometers), and the average width of this zone at half a mile, these\r\ndeposits are now forming over an area of 62,500 square miles (about\r\n160,000 square kilometers) of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n=Non-littoral, mechanical deposits in shallow water.=—These deposits\r\nare laid down in the zone of the ocean between low-water mark and the\r\n100-fathom line. They cover about 10,000,000 square miles.[172] Their\r\ncomposition is much the same as that of the littoral deposits, with\r\nwhich they are continuous, though on the whole they are finer. At\r\ntheir lower limit they pass insensibly into the fine deposits of the\r\ndeep sea. Coarse material, such as gravel and sand, prevails, though\r\nin special situations, such as depressions and inclosed basins, muddy\r\ndeposits are found. While some of the deposits are wholly composed\r\nof inorganic débris, organic remains are freely mingled with others.\r\nThe mechanical effects of tides, currents, and waves are everywhere\r\npresent, but become less and less well marked as the 100-fathom line\r\nis approached. The forms of vegetable and animal life are numerous,\r\nthough the former decrease as depths which exclude the sunlight are\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nBoth littoral deposits and deposits in shallow water outside the\r\nlittoral zone have already been referred to in connection with the work\r\nof waves and currents (pp. 355–66). A few additional points only need\r\nhere be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Figs.+ 321 and 322.—Diagrams showing how shallow-water\r\n  deposits may attain considerable depth by the shifting of the zone of\r\n  deposition seaward.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 323.—Diagram showing the interwedging of gravel-,\r\n  sand-, and mud-beds.]\r\n\r\nIn general the coarser sediments are lodged near shore and those\r\nfarther from the land become progressively finer. Even the coarser\r\npart of the material carried in suspension by the undertow is partly\r\nleft in the shallow water. On the other hand, waves of exceptional\r\nstrength may carry coarse material into water of some depth. Thus\r\ncoarse shingle (gravel) and even bowlders have been found at depths of\r\n10 fathoms.[173] Coarse deposits may extend far out from land if the\r\nwaves are strong, and especially if the water is shallow, and since\r\nthe zone of shallow water may be extended seaward by the aggradation\r\nof the bottom, shallow-water deposits may cover extensive areas. They\r\nmay become deep at the same time, for as the outer border of the\r\nshallow-water zone is shifted seaward by aggradation, the vertical\r\nspace to be filled becomes greater (compare Figs. 321 and 322).\r\nAgain, if the coast be sinking, new deposits of coarse material may\r\nbe made on older ones. In this way also great thicknesses of sediment\r\nmay be accumulated, all parts of which were deposited in shallow water.\r\nThe great thickness of some of the conglomerate beds of the past shows\r\nhow far this process may go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 324.—Ripple-marks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 325.—Rill-marks resembling impressions of\r\n  seaweeds. Beach at Noyes Point, R. I. (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 326.—Rill-marks. Same locality as 325. (Walcott.)]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, no definite line marks the seaward terminus of the coarse\r\ndetritus, since coarse material is carried farther out when the waves\r\nrun high (and the undertow is strong) than when they are feeble. In\r\ncalm weather, therefore, fine sediment may be deposited where coarse\r\nhad been laid down in the preceding storm, only to be covered in turn\r\nby other deposits of a different character. Thus gravel grades off into\r\nsand, with more or less overlapping or interwedging, and sand grades\r\noff into silt in the same way. This is diagrammatically illustrated by\r\nFig. 323.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of shallow-water deposits.=—Clastic sediments laid\r\ndown in shallow water have several distinctive characteristics. While\r\nthey are, in the aggregate, coarse, they are characterized by frequent\r\nvariations in coarseness. The surfaces of successive beds are likely\r\nto be ripple- and rill-marked (Figs. 324, 325, 326), and cross-bedding\r\n(Fig. 327) is of common occurrence. Clayey sediments accumulated\r\nbetween high and low water are often sun-cracked (Fig. 328), and the\r\ntracks of land animals are sometimes preserved on their surfaces.\r\nShallow-water deposits often contain fossils of organisms which live\r\nin waters of slight depth. These characteristics are sufficient to\r\ndifferentiate sedimentary formations made in shallow water from those\r\nmade in deep water, even after they have been converted into solid\r\nrock and after the rock has emerged from the sea. Many of these\r\ncharacteristics are, however, shared by deposits made by streams on the\r\nland. Subaërial and lacustrine sediments are usually distinguishable\r\nfrom those made in the sea by their fossils, and sometimes by their\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 327.—Cross-bedding. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 328.—Sun-cracks. These cracks were on the\r\n  mud-flats of the Missouri a few miles above Kansas City, but\r\n  the sun-cracks on shore-deposits are not essentially different.\r\n  (Calvin.)]\r\n\r\n=Topography of shallow-water deposits.=—The shallow-water deposits\r\nhave, on the whole, a rather plane surface, though there are some\r\nnotable departures from flatness. The steep slopes of the delta fronts\r\nand of wave-built terraces have already been spoken of. Barriers often\r\nshut in depressions, and the disposition of the material deposited is\r\nsometimes uneven, owing to shore and tidal currents. The result is that\r\nthe surface of the shallow-water deposits is often affected by low\r\nelevations and by shallow depressions. The elevations and depressions\r\nmay be elongate, circular, or irregular in form. These general facts\r\nare shown in Figs. 319, 320, and 329. This topography is sometimes\r\npreserved on newly emerged lands, as at various points on the Coastal\r\nPlain of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 329.—Irregularities of topography of\r\n  shallow-water deposits. The depths of the water are shown in fathoms.\r\n  (Chart of C. and G. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Chemical and organic deposits.=—There is no sharp line of distinction\r\nbetween the deposits usually classed as chemical and those regarded as\r\norganic. The latter are chemical in the broader sense of the term, but\r\nas they are immediately associated with life and are dependent upon it,\r\nit is a matter of practical convenience to separate them. Aside from\r\nthe organic deposits, the chemical deposits made in shallow sea-water\r\nembrace (1) those due to reactions between constituents so brought\r\ntogether that new and insoluble compounds are formed and precipitated,\r\nand (2) those due to evaporation. The points of saturation for the\r\nvarious substances dissolved in sea-water are reached at different\r\nstages, and hence they are deposited more or less in succession.\r\n\r\nThe chemical deposits made in the shallow water of the sea, or in\r\nshallow bodies of water isolated from the sea, are chiefly simple\r\nprecipitates resulting from evaporation; but new combinations are\r\nsometimes made in the process of concentration and precipitation.\r\nAll substances in solution are necessarily precipitated on complete\r\nevaporation, but since the sea-water is in general far from saturation,\r\nso far as all its leading salts are concerned, only a few are\r\nthrown down in quantity sufficient to have geological importance\r\nwhere evaporation is incomplete. The leading deposits are lime\r\ncarbonate (CaCO₃), lime sulphate (gypsum, CaSO₄,2H₂O), common salt\r\n(rock-salt, NaCl), and the magnesium salts, usually the chlorides and\r\nsulphates, which are later changed to carbonates. In investigations\r\non Mediterranean water[174] which had an initial density of 1.02, no\r\ndeposit took place until concentration by evaporation had brought the\r\nwater to a specific gravity of 1.05. Between this density and that\r\nof 1.13, lime carbonate and some iron oxide were deposited. Between\r\n1.13 and 1.22, lime sulphate was the most abundant precipitate, while\r\nbetween 1.22 and 1.31, 95% of the deposit was common salt. With still\r\nfurther concentration, the remaining substances in solution, especially\r\nthe magnesium salts, were thrown down.\r\n\r\nWhile there is somewhat more than ten times as much lime sulphate as\r\nlime carbonate in the ocean (p. 324), the deposits of the carbonate\r\n(including the organic) have been very much greater than those of the\r\nsulphate. This is due partly to the fact that the sulphate is much more\r\nsoluble in natural waters than the carbonate. Rivers bring much more\r\ncarbonate than sulphate to the sea, so that the point of saturation for\r\nthe sulphate would normally be reached much later than that of the\r\ncarbonate. The more important fact, however, is that marine plants and\r\nanimals use lime carbonate freely for skeletal and housing purposes.\r\nIt is held by some that they get their lime from the sulphate, but if\r\nso they convert it into carbonate before it takes the form of shells,\r\ncoral, etc., the sulphuric acid set free in the process reproducing,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, more sulphate. The secretion of lime carbonate\r\nby organisms is not dependent on the saturation of the water, but may\r\nbe carried on when the amount in solution is very small.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the chief deposits of lime carbonate\r\nhave been and are being made through the agency of plants and animals\r\nin the form of shells, coral, bones, teeth, and other devices for\r\nsupporting, stiffening, housing, protecting, and arming themselves;\r\nbut while it is agreed that the larger part of the lime carbonate\r\ndeposited in the open sea is of organic origin, it is equally clear\r\nthat in closed seas subject to concentration from evaporation, simple\r\nprecipitation takes place freely. There is some difference of opinion\r\nas to the importance of these two classes of deposits, past and\r\npresent. The debated point is whether simple precipitation takes place\r\nin any appreciable degree under the usual oceanic conditions. There is\r\nmuch more evidence of solution by sea-water than of precipitation from\r\nit. The ocean appears to be under-saturated with lime carbonate on the\r\nwhole, though it is still possible that deposition may take place in\r\nfavorable situations, as, for example, where the very calcareous waters\r\nof rivers are spread out in thin sheets on the surface of the heavier\r\nsalt water, and thus exposed to exceptional evaporation, or where there\r\nis very exceptional agitation and aëration.[175]\r\n\r\nGypsum appears to be deposited in quantity only in the closed basins of\r\narid regions where concentration reaches an advanced state.\r\n\r\nSince normal sea-water is far from saturation with common salt,\r\nthe latter is precipitated only in lagoons, closed seas, or other\r\nsituations favorable to great concentration. This is usually achieved\r\nonly in notably arid regions, and in basins that receive little or no\r\ndrainage from the land.\r\n\r\nDeposits of salt usually, therefore, signify highly arid conditions,\r\nand where they occur over wide ranges in latitude and longitude, as\r\nin certain periods of the past, unusual aridity is inferred. Where\r\nconfined to limited areas, their climatic significance is less, for\r\ntopographic conditions may determine local aridity. The total area\r\nwhere salt is now being precipitated is small, though on the whole\r\nthe present is probably to be regarded as a rather arid period of the\r\nearth’s history. On the other hand, ancient deposits of salt preserved\r\nin the sedimentary strata show that the area of salt deposition has\r\nbeen much more considerable than now at one time and another in the\r\nearth’s history. The salt and gypsum deposits of the past seem,\r\ntherefore, to tell an interesting tale of the climates of the past.\r\n\r\nThe magnesium salts are among the last to be thrown down as the\r\nsea-water is evaporated, and they most commonly take the form of\r\nsulphates and chlorides. They often form double salts with potassium,\r\na relatively small and soluble constituent of sea-water. In the\r\nartificial evaporation of salt water to obtain common salt, the process\r\nis usually stopped before the saturation-point for the magnesium salts\r\nis reached, and the residue, the “mother-liquor,” or “bittern,” is\r\ndrawn off to prevent these “bitter” salts from mixing with the common\r\nsalt. The magnesium salts are among the last to be precipitated, not\r\nonly because they are readily soluble, but because their quantity is\r\nsmall; yet in the original rock from which all the sea-salts came,\r\nthere is at least as much magnesium as sodium, while in the sea there\r\nis about five times as much sodium as magnesium. Just what becomes of\r\nthe remaining magnesium is not yet well understood. It has a notable\r\ndisposition to form double salts with some other constituent, as noted\r\nabove. In the earlier marine strata, dolomite, that is, limestone\r\ncomposed partly or wholly of the double carbonate of lime and magnesia,\r\n(CaMg)CO₃, abounds. This appears to have been formed by a gradual\r\nsubstitution of molecules of magnesium for those of calcium, but\r\njust how and when and why it was done has not been fully worked out.\r\nIt appears to be a case where the saline matter of the sea made its\r\ncontribution to the sedimentary deposits by chemical reaction upon\r\nthem, rather than by precipitation because of saturation.\r\n\r\nThe relatively small amount of potash in the sea-water is probably due\r\nto its disposition to remain united with the clays and earths of the\r\nmantle rock and of the shaley deposits.\r\n\r\nTo some extent the salts in solution act directly on the earthy matter\r\nbrought down into the sea by rivers, but where sedimentation is rapid,\r\nas it often is in shallow water, this action is limited and obscure.\r\nIn the main, the ocean-waters protect the sediments from weathering\r\nand similar changes, except as organic matter buried with them induces\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nWhile the lime deposits are by far the greatest of the chemical and\r\norganic deposits of the sea, plants and animals also secrete notable\r\nquantities of silica. Silica deposits of organic origin are relatively\r\nmuch more important in the deep sea than in shallow water, and will be\r\nmentioned in that connection.\r\n\r\n=Limestone.=—Something concerning the origin of limestone has already\r\nbeen given in the preceding paragraphs, but because of the importance\r\nof this formation, it may be added by way of summary that shallow seas\r\nfree, or nearly free, from terrigenous sediment, and abounding in\r\nlime-secreting life, furnish the conditions for nearly pure deposits\r\nof limestone, and that most of the limestone within the areas of the\r\npresent continents appears to have originated under such conditions.\r\nThe common notion that limestone is normally a deep-water formation is\r\na serious error. Although limestones are formed in deep as well as in\r\nshallow waters, by far the more important classes of lime-secreting\r\norganisms are photobathic, i.e. are limited to the depths to which\r\nlight penetrates. In the shallow waters, these plants and animals are\r\nin part free and in part attached. Within the areas of deep water they\r\nare free and at the surface, and their remains drop to the bottom,\r\nif not sooner dissolved. But few forms live on the deep, dark, cold\r\nbottoms of abysmal depths. Clear waters, free from abundant terrigenous\r\nsediments and abounding in lime-secreting life, rather than deep\r\nwaters, are, therefore, the most favorable conditions for the origin of\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nThe purely chemical deposits of limestone are probably all of\r\nshallow-water origin. Once made, they are subject to solution,\r\nredeposition, and other mutations like other deposits. As a result,\r\nthey often lose many of their original characteristics, but enough\r\nusually remain to tell the story of their origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Deep-sea Deposits._\r\n\r\n=Contrasted with shallow-water deposits.=—The deep-sea deposits cover\r\nthe ocean-bottom below the 100-fathom line. Their area is considerably\r\nmore than half the earth’s surface. The characteristic deposits are\r\nmuds, organic oozes, and clays, which in their physical characteristics\r\nare remarkably uniform. In regions of floating ice, greater diversity\r\nis introduced from the varied nature of the materials which the ice\r\ntransports, but gravels and sands, comparable to those of shallow\r\nwater, are rarely found. “Tides, currents, and waves produce some\r\nmechanical effects at the upper limits of the deep-sea region, but\r\non the whole there is an absence of the phenomena of erosion, and\r\nmechanical action would appear to be absent except in the case of\r\nsubmarine eruptions. The depth is too great for sunlight to penetrate,\r\nand vegetable life is limited to the upper zone. Animal life is present\r\nin the same zone and on the bottom, but absent or nearly so in the\r\nmiddle depths. The temperature (at the bottom) is below 40° Fahr.\r\nthroughout the larger part of the area, and if subject to variation\r\nwith latitude or change of season, these changes affect only the depths\r\nimmediately beyond the 100-fathom line. Throughout the whole region\r\nthere is a very uniform set of conditions. In the shallow-water and\r\nlittoral zones, owing to the rapid accumulation and the mechanical\r\neffects of transportation and erosion, the effects of chemical\r\nmodification are not very apparent in the deposits; but in deep-sea\r\ndeposits, in consequence of the less rapid rate of accumulation,\r\nabsence of transport, the nature and small size of the particles, many\r\nevident chemical reactions have taken place, resulting in the formation\r\n_in situ_ of glauconite, phosphatic and manganese nodules, zeolites,\r\nand other secondary products.”[1] With increasing depth and distance\r\nfrom the shore, the character of the deposits undergoes a change. There\r\nis less and less material derived directly from the land, and more\r\n“amorphous matter arising from the ultimate decomposition of minerals\r\nand rocks, and accompanied, in all moderate depths, by an increase\r\n[relative] of the remains of pelagic organisms. We thus pass insensibly\r\nfrom those deep-sea deposits of a terrestrial origin, which we call\r\n‘terrigenous,’ to those deep-sea deposits denominated ‘pelagic,’ in\r\nwhich the remains of calcareous and siliceous organisms, clays and\r\nother substances of secondary origin play the principal rôle.”[176]\r\n\r\nThe following table[177] shows the relations of the various groups of\r\nmarine deposits.\r\n\r\n  1.

Littoral deposits between } Sands, gravels,  }\r\n     high- and low-water marks }   muds, etc.     }\r\n\r\n=Sources.=—The pelagic deposits are made up in part of materials of\r\norganic origin, and in part of materials of inorganic origin. The\r\ninorganic materials may be of mechanical or chemical origin. Mechanical\r\npelagic deposits originate in various ways. They may come (1) from\r\nthe land by the ordinary processes of gradation, (2) from volcanic\r\nvents, or (3) from extra-terrestrial sources. Chemical deposits may\r\nbe formed (1) _in situ_ by the chemical interaction of substances in\r\nthe sea-water on materials of organic and inorganic origin, and (2) by\r\ndirect precipitation from the sea-water.\r\n\r\n=Mechanical inorganic deposits.=—The terrigenous materials which reach\r\nthe deep sea are, as a rule, only the finest products of land decay,\r\nand are carried out by movements of water or by the winds. They are\r\nnot commonly recognized in the dredgings more than 200 miles from\r\nthe shore, but opposite the mouths of great rivers they extend much\r\nfarther,—1000 miles in the case of the Amazon. They are especially\r\nabundant on the slopes of the continental shelves. Here occur the\r\n_blue_, _green_, and _red muds_, with which are associated volcanic\r\nand coral muds. The color of these various muds is dependent in part\r\non the changes which they have undergone since their deposition.\r\nThe green muds usually contain enough glauconite to give them their\r\ncolor, and are most commonly found off bold coasts where sedimentation\r\nis not rapid. The blue muds indicate lack of oxidation, or perhaps\r\ndeoxidation. Red muds are not common, though they have been found in\r\nsome situations. In general, these deposits are analogous to certain\r\nshales, marls, etc., found within the continents.\r\n\r\nThough coarse materials derived from the land are occasionally found in\r\nthe deep-sea deposits, their presence must be looked upon as in some\r\nsense accidental. Occasional pebbles, or even bowlders, are carried out\r\ninto the ocean entangled in the roots of floating trees. Within limits,\r\ntoo, icebergs have carried out land débris, though it is probable that\r\ntransportation by this means has been exaggerated. The amount which\r\nicebergs might carry, if fully loaded, is far greater than the amount\r\nwhich they do carry.\r\n\r\nOf the identifiable inorganic materials in the deep sea, the most\r\nabundant are of volcanic origin, and among these the most common is\r\npumice, which is frequently so light that it floats readily until it\r\nbecomes water-logged. Pieces of pumice brought up by the Challenger and\r\nthoroughly dried were found to float for months in sea-water before\r\nsettling even through the depth of water contained in the vessel\r\nin which the experiment was performed.[178] The next most abundant\r\nsubstance of volcanic origin in pelagic deposits is _volcanic glass_.\r\nThis ranges from pieces of the size of a walnut down to the smallest\r\nfragments, which often serve as centers for concretions. _Lapilli_\r\n(cinders) and _volcanic ash_ also are abundant in parts of the deep\r\nsea. The distribution of these volcanic products is essentially\r\nuniversal, though by no means uniform. Some of them are probably from\r\nsubmarine volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe study of the deep sea deposits has revealed the presence of many\r\nnodules and grains which are believed to be of extra-terrestrial\r\norigin. Many of them are magnetic.[179] The dust of countless meteors\r\nwhich enter the atmosphere daily settles on land and sea alike, and\r\nenters into the sediment of the bottom of the latter. It is probably\r\nno more abundant in deep water than in shallow, but it is relatively\r\nmore important, since other sedimentation is more meager. The number of\r\nmeteorites which enter the atmosphere daily has been estimated at from\r\n15,000,000 to 20,000,000.[180] If on the average the meteorites weigh\r\nten grains each, probably a rather high estimate, the total amount of\r\nextra-terrestrial matter reaching the earth yearly would be 5,000 to\r\n7,000 tons, and something like three-fourths of this must, on the\r\naverage, fall into the sea. But even at this rate it would take some\r\nfifty billion years to cover the sea-bottom with a layer one foot in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n=Organic constituents of pelagic deposits.=—With increasing distance\r\nfrom shores, and especially with increasing depth of water, terrigenous\r\ndeposits become less and less abundant, and sediments derived from\r\npelagic life increase in relative importance. Beyond the upper part of\r\nthe outer slopes of the continental shelves, the pelagic deposits are\r\nlargely made up of shells and skeletons of marine organisms which live\r\nin the surface-waters. Pelagic molluscs, foraminifera, and algæ secrete\r\nshells of lime carbonate, while diatoms and radiolarians secrete shells\r\nof silica. When the organisms die, they sink to the bottom with their\r\nshells, and these mineral matters of organic origin are mingled with\r\nthe volcanic products which are universal over the sea-floor. Pelagic\r\ndeposits of organic origin are named according to their characteristic\r\nconstituents. Thus there are pteropod oozes, globigerina oozes, diatom\r\noozes, radiolarian oozes, etc.[181] It is not to be understood that\r\nthese oozes are made up exclusively of the shells which give them their\r\nnames. Diatom ooze is an ooze in which diatom shells are abundant, not\r\nan ooze made up wholly of diatom shells; and globigerina ooze is an\r\nooze in which globigerina shells are abundant, though in many cases\r\nthey do not make up even the bulk of the matter. While samples of these\r\nvarious oozes might be selected which are thoroughly distinct from one\r\nanother, there are all gradations between them, since pelagic life does\r\nnot recognize boundary-lines.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that with increasing depth the proportion\r\nof lime carbonate in the ooze decreases. Thus in tropical regions\r\nremote from land where the depths are less than 600 fathoms, the\r\ncarbonate of lime of the shells of pelagic organisms may constitute\r\n80% or 90% of the deposit. With the same surface conditions, but with\r\nincreasing depth, the percentage of lime carbonate decreases, until at\r\n2000 fathoms it is less than 60%; at 2400 fathoms, 30%, and at 2600\r\nfathoms, 10%. Beyond this depth there are usually no more than traces\r\nof carbonate of lime. The data at hand show that the percentage of lime\r\ncarbonate falls off below 2200 fathoms more rapidly than at lesser\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nWhen the percentage of lime carbonate becomes very low, the calcareous\r\noozes grade off into the red clay with which the sea-floor below 2400\r\nto 2600 fathoms is covered.\r\n\r\n=Chemical deposits.=—The chemical deposits of the deep sea are chiefly\r\nthe alteration products of sediments which reach the sea-bottom\r\nby mechanical means. All sediment deposited in the sea undergoes\r\nmore or less chemical change, but it is only when the change is\r\nvery considerable that the product is referred to this class. Where\r\nsedimentation is rapid and the sediment coarse, the chemical change is\r\nrelatively slight; but where the sedimentation is slow and the sediment\r\nfine, the chemical change is relatively great; for the longer exposure\r\nto the sea-water and the greater proportion of surface exposed to\r\nattack, both favor change. Both the area and the mass of sea-bottom\r\nsediment radically changed in this way are large, but most of the\r\ndeposit does not correspond to any formation known on the land.\r\n\r\nThe red clay already referred to belongs to this class of deposits.\r\nIts origin has been the subject of much discussion. It contains much\r\nvolcanic débris, various concretions, bones of mammals, zeolitic\r\ncrystals, and extra-terrestrial spherules, and doubtless the insoluble\r\nproducts of the shells of pelagic life; but it is still a mooted\r\nquestion how far the clay itself is the product of decomposed shells,\r\nand how far the altered product of pulverized pumice, volcanic ash,\r\ndust, etc. Pelagic life does not seem to be less abundant at the\r\nsurface where the water is deep than where it is shallow, and it would\r\nappear that the shells must sink in such situations as elsewhere. If\r\nthe lime carbonate of globigerina ooze be removed by dilute acid, the\r\ninorganic residue is similar to the red clay in the ocean-bottom. This\r\nsuggests that owing to the more complete solution in the very deep\r\nwater, the lime carbonate of the shells has been dissolved, leaving\r\nthe red clay as a residuum. The more complete solution at the bottom\r\nmight be the result either of the greater pressure, or of a greater\r\npercentage of CO₂ in the water due to emanations from the sea-floor, or\r\nto both; but the suddenness of the transition from oozes to red clay,\r\nwith increasing depth, does not seem to be fully explained by these\r\nassumptions. The study of the dredgings has inclined the students of\r\nthese materials to the conclusion that volcanic materials, rather than\r\nshells, are the principal source of the red clay.[182] The volcanic\r\nmaterials are thought to have accumulated slowly and to have been long\r\nexposed to the action of sea-water. The various nodules and crystals in\r\nthe clay are believed to be secondary products, the materials for which\r\nwere derived from the decomposition of the same materials. Eolian dust\r\nmay be a notable constituent of the red clay.\r\n\r\nVarious specific products of chemical change may be briefly referred\r\nto. The decomposition of certain mineral particles, such as feldspar,\r\ngives rise to _kaolin_, and kaolin is a very considerable constituent\r\nof most of the clayey deposits of the ocean-bottom. The kaolinization\r\nof feldspar may take place both on land and in the sea. _Manganiferous_\r\ndeposits are widespread in the ocean-bottom, occurring both as coatings\r\non grains of mechanical sediments, shells, etc., and as concretions\r\nranging in sizes from minute particles to nodules an inch or more in\r\ndiameter. The concretions are sometimes approximately spheroidal, but\r\noften botryoidal. These manganiferous nodules are believed to have\r\narisen from the decay of fragments of volcanic rocks. In their decay,\r\nthe manganese and iron are believed to have been first changed to\r\ncarbonates, and subsequently to oxides. After manganese oxide, iron\r\noxide and silica are by far the most abundant constituents, but many\r\nother substances enter into their composition in minor quantities.\r\n\r\nAnother substance somewhat widely distributed in the sea-bed, though\r\nby no means universal, is _glauconite_, a complex silicate of alumina,\r\niron, potassium, etc. Glauconite is, on the whole, most abundant\r\nalong the edges of the continental shelves, though it is by no means\r\nuniversal in this position. It is not commonly found in deep water,\r\nnor very near the shore, but approximately at the “mud-line.” The\r\nglauconite grains begin to form, as a rule, in tiny shells, chiefly\r\nthe shells of foraminifera. After filling the shell, the shell itself\r\nmay disappear, while the glauconite goes on accumulating around the\r\ncore already formed, until the grain attains considerable size.\r\nGlauconite is believed to be an alteration product of certain sorts\r\nof mechanical sediment, the change being effected under the influence\r\nof the decaying organic matter in the shells.[183] It does not occur\r\nwhere sedimentation is rapid, and its formation appears to be favored\r\nby considerable changes of temperature. Glauconite deposits occur on\r\nthe land and are commonly known as _green sand marl_. Glauconite also\r\noccurs sparingly in many other sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 330.—Distribution of various sorts of deep-sea\r\n  deposits. (Murray. Challenger Reports.)]\r\n\r\nAnother substance which is somewhat widespread in the ocean-bottom is\r\n_phosphate of lime_, which occurs in various sorts of oozes, in the\r\nmanganiferous nodules, in glauconite, and in independent nodules. Like\r\nthe grains of glauconite, the grains of phosphate of lime appear to\r\nhave started as concretions in shells, and to be the result of the\r\nreaction of organic matter on the contents of sea-water. The immediate\r\nsource of the lime phosphate in the water appears to have been the\r\nshells or bones of the numerous animals living in the sea.\r\n\r\nSecondary minerals made from the constituents of volcanic matter which\r\nhas been decomposed occur not uncommonly in the bottom of the sea.\r\nThese minerals belong to the general class of _zeolites_, phillipsite\r\nbeing the most abundant. Their distribution is somewhat wide, but their\r\nquantity is slight.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, knowledge of the deep-sea deposits is limited to their\r\nsuperficial layers. Soundings do not usually penetrate more than a few\r\ninches, or at most a foot or two.\r\n\r\nUnlike shallow-water deposits, those of the really deep sea seem to\r\nfind no correlatives in the known rock formations of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LAKES.\r\n\r\nMost of the phenomena of the ocean are repeated on a smaller scale in\r\nlakes. The waves of lakes and their attendant undertows and littoral\r\ncurrents are governed by the same laws and do the same sort of work\r\nas the corresponding movements of the ocean. Tides are absent, or\r\ninsignificant, but slight changes of level, known as _seiches_,[184]\r\nhave been observed in many lakes. They are probably caused by sudden\r\nchanges in atmospheric pressure. While they are generally very slight,\r\nthey frequently amount to as much as a foot, and occasionally to\r\nseveral feet. The seiches are oscillatory movements, and their period\r\nis influenced by the length and depth of the lake. They have been\r\nstudied most carefully in Switzerland. Currents corresponding to those\r\nof the ocean are slight or wanting in lakes, but since most lakes have\r\ninlets and outlets, their waters are in constant movement toward the\r\nlatter. In most cases this movement is too slow to be readily noted, or\r\nto do effective work either in corrasion or transportation. The work of\r\nthe ice, on the other hand, is relatively more important in lakes than\r\nin the sea.\r\n\r\n=Changes taking place in lakes.=—The processes in operation in lakes\r\nare easily observed and readily understood. (1) The waves wear the\r\nshores, and the material thus derived is transported, assorted, and\r\ndeposited as in the sea, and all the topographic forms resulting from\r\nerosion or deposition along the seacoast are reproduced on their\r\nappropriate scale in lakes. (2) Streams bear their burden of gravel,\r\nsand, and mud into lakes and leave it there. (3) The winds blow dust\r\nand sand into the lakes, and in some places pile the sand up into dunes\r\nalong the shores. (4) Animals of various sorts live in the lakes, and\r\ntheir shells and bones give rise to deposits comparable to the animal\r\ndeposits in the sea. (5) Abundant plants grow in the shallow water\r\nabout the borders of many ponds and lakes, and as they die, their\r\nsubstance accumulates on the bottom. (6) At the outlet the water is\r\nconstantly lowering its channel. The lowering of the outlet is often\r\nslow, especially if the rock be coherent, for the outflowing water\r\nis usually clear, and therefore inefficient in corrasive work. These\r\nsix processes are essentially universal, and all conspire against the\r\nperpetuity of the lakes. (7) In lakes where the temperature is low\r\nenough for ice to be formed, it crowds on the shores and develops\r\nphenomena peculiar to itself. The ice of the sea may work in similar\r\nways, but its work is restricted to high latitudes. (8) In lakes in\r\narid regions, deposits are often made by precipitation from solution.\r\nThe first five and the last of these processes are filling the basins\r\nof the lakes. As the sediment is deposited, a corresponding volume\r\nof water is displaced, and, if there be outlets, forced out of the\r\nbasins; the sixth process is equally antagonistic to the lakes, while\r\nthe seventh has little influence on their permanence. Given time\r\nenough, these processes must bring the history of any lake to an end.\r\nThe lowering of the outlet will alone accomplish this result if the\r\nbottom of the basin is above base-level. Many lakes have already become\r\nextinct, either through the filling or draining of their basins, or\r\nthrough both combined. The antagonism of rivers and lakes long ago\r\nled to the epigram “Rivers are the mortal enemies of lakes.” True as\r\nthis statement is, it does not follow that lakes will ever cease to\r\nexist, for the causes which produce new lakes may be in operation\r\ncontemporaneously with those which bring lakes now in existence to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n=Lacustrine deposits.=—The beds of sediment deposited in lakes are\r\nsimilar in kind, in structure, and in disposition to beds of sediment\r\nlaid down in the sea, but river-borne sediment is more commonly\r\nconcentrated into deltas, since waves and shore-currents are less\r\neffective. Even the limestone of the sea has its correlative in some\r\nlakes. Some of it was made of the shells of fresh-water animals which\r\nthrove where the inwash of terrigenous sediment was slight, some of\r\nit from the calcareous secretions of plants,[185] and some of it was\r\nprecipitated from solution.[186] Salt and iron-ore[187] deposits are\r\nalso sometimes made in lakes.\r\n\r\n=Extinct lakes.=—The former existence of lakes where none now exist\r\nmay be known in various ways. If the lake basin was filled, its former\r\narea is a flat, the beds of which bear evidence, in their composition,\r\ntheir structure, and often in their fossil contents, of their origin\r\nin standing water. Such a flat is commonly so situated topographically\r\nthat the basin would be reproduced if the lacustrine deposits were\r\nremoved. To this general rule there might be exceptions, as where a\r\nglacier formed one side of the basin when it was filled. If the lake\r\nwas destroyed by the reduction of its outlet, or by the removal of some\r\nother barrier, such as glacier ice, or by desiccation, shore phenomena,\r\nsuch as beaches, spits, etc., may be found. In time such evidences are\r\ndestroyed by subaërial erosion, so that they are most distinct soon\r\nafter the lake becomes extinct.\r\n\r\nMany lakes, some of them large[188] and many of them small, are known\r\nto have become extinct, while many others are now in their last stages,\r\nnamely, marshes. Many others have been greatly reduced in size. Such\r\nreductions are often obvious where deltas are built into lakes. Thus\r\nthe delta built by the Rhone into Lake Geneva is several miles in\r\nlength, and has been lengthened nearly two miles since the time of\r\nthe Roman occupation. The end of Seneca (N. Y.) lake has been crowded\r\nnorthward some two miles by deposition at its head. Similar changes\r\nhave taken place and are now in progress in many other lakes.\r\n\r\n=Lake ice.=[189]—Since fresh water is densest at 39° Fahr., ice does\r\nnot commonly form on the surface until the temperature from top to\r\nbottom is reduced to this point. Cooled below this temperature, the\r\nsurface-water fails to sink, and with sufficient reduction freezes. If\r\nthe lake be small, and especially if it be shallow, it is likely to\r\nfreeze over completely in any region where the temperature is notably\r\nbelow the freezing-point for fresh water for any considerable period\r\nof time. It is under these circumstances that the ice becomes most\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 331.—Ice crowding upon low shore. Clear Lake, Ia.\r\n  (Calvin.)]\r\n\r\nSuppose a lake in temperate latitudes, where the range of temperature\r\nis considerable, to be frozen over when the temperature is 20° Fahr.\r\nIf now the temperature be suddenly lowered to -10°, and such change of\r\ntemperature is not uncommon in the northern part of the United States,\r\nthe ice contracts notably. In contracting, it either pulls away from\r\nthe shores or cracks. If the former, the water from which the ice is\r\nwithdrawn quickly freezes; if the latter, water rises in the cracks\r\nand freezes there. In either case, the ice-cover of the lake is again\r\ncomplete. If the temperature now rises to 20° the ice expands. The\r\ncover is now too large for the lake, and it must either crowd up on the\r\nshores (Fig. 331) or arch up (wrinkle) elsewhere. It follows the one\r\ncourse or the other, or both, according to the resistance offered by\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nIf the water near the shore is very shallow, the ice freezes to the\r\nsand, gravel, and bowlders at the bottom. If the adjacent land is low,\r\nthe ice in expanding may shove up over it, carrying the débris frozen\r\nin its bottom. It may even push up loose gravel and sand in front of\r\nits edge if they be present on the shore. Where bowlders are frozen\r\nto the bottom of the ice, the shoreward thrust in expanding has the\r\neffect of shifting them in the same direction, and even of lifting\r\nthem a little above the normal water-level. This constant process of\r\nconcentrating bowlders at the shore-line gives rise to the “walled”\r\nlakes, which are not uncommon in the northern part of the United\r\nStates. The “wall” does not commonly extend entirely around a lake,\r\nthough it exists at various points on the shores of many lakes. In\r\nmaking the walls, the ice shoved up by winds, especially in the spring\r\nwhen the ice is breaking up, coöperates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 333.—Calcareous tufa domes. Pyramid Lake, Nev.\r\n  (Russell.)]\r\n\r\nIf the lake be bordered by a low marsh, the ice and frozen earth of the\r\nlatter are really continuous with the ice of the lake, and the push of\r\nthe latter sometimes arches up the former into distinct anticlines,\r\nthe frozen part only being involved in the deformation. A succession\r\nof colder and less cold periods may give rise to a succession of such\r\nanticlines.[190] If the shore be steep and of non-resistant material,\r\nthe crowding of the ice produces different but not less striking\r\nresults. Where the thrust of the ice is against a low cliff of yielding\r\nmaterial, such as clay, it disturbs all above the shore-line. Where the\r\ncliff is sufficiently resistant, it withstands the push of the ice, and\r\nthe ice itself is warped and broken.\r\n\r\n=Saline lakes.=—A few lakes, especially in arid or semi-arid regions,\r\nare salt, and others are “bitter.” Beside sodium chloride, salt\r\nlakes usually contain magnesium chloride, and magnesium and calcium\r\nsulphates. “Bitter” lakes usually contain much sodium carbonate, as\r\nwell as some sodium chloride and sulphate, and sometimes borax. The\r\ndegrees of saltness and bitterness vary from freshness on the one\r\nhand to saturation on the other. The water of the Caspian Sea (lake)\r\ncontains, on the average, less salt than that of the sea; that of Great\r\nSalt Lake contains about 18%; that of the Dead Sea, about 24%; and that\r\nof Lake Van (eastern Turkestan), the densest body of water known, about\r\n33%. See accompanying table.\r\n\r\nMany salt lakes, such as the Dead Sea and Great Salt Lake, are\r\ndescended from fresh-water ancestors, while others, like the Caspian\r\nand Aral Seas, are probably isolated portions of the ocean. Lakes of\r\nthe former class have usually become salt through a decrease in the\r\nhumidity of the region where they occur. The water begins to be salt\r\nwhen the aridity is such that evaporation from the lake exceeds its\r\ninflow. In this case the inflowing waters bring in small amounts of\r\nsaline and alkaline matter, which is concentrated as evaporation takes\r\nplace. The concentration may go on until the point of saturation is\r\nreached, or until chemical reactions cause precipitation. In general\r\nthe least soluble minerals are precipitated first. Thus gypsum begins\r\nto be deposited from sea-water when 37% of it has been evaporated; but\r\nthe saturation-point for salt is not reached until 93% of the water has\r\nbeen evaporated (see p. 375). The relations in lakes are similar, and\r\ngypsum deposits often underlie those of salt. Deposits of salt and\r\nother mineral matters once in solution are making in some salt lakes\r\nat the present time, and considerable formations of the same sort have\r\nbeen so made in the past. Buried beneath sediments of other sorts, beds\r\nof common salt or of other precipitates are preserved for ages. Lime\r\ncarbonate has been precipitated in quantity from some extinct lakes\r\n(Fig. 333).\r\n\r\nThe lakes which originate by the isolation of portions of the sea\r\nare salt at the outset. If inflow exceeds evaporation, they become\r\nfresher and may ultimately become fresh; otherwise they remain salt.\r\nIf evaporation exceeds inflow they diminish in size and their waters\r\nbecome more and more salt or bitter.\r\n\r\n=Indirect effects of lakes.=—Lakes tend to modify the climate of\r\nthe region where they occur, both by increasing its humidity and\r\nby decreasing its range of temperature. They act as reservoirs\r\nfor surface-waters, and so tend to restrain floods and to promote\r\nregularity of stream flow. They purify the waters which enter them by\r\nallowing their sediments to settle, and so influence the work and the\r\nlife of the waters below.\r\n\r\n=Composition of lake-waters.=—The accompanying table[191] shows the\r\ncomposition of various inclosed lake-waters, and gives some idea of\r\nthe wide range, both in kind and quantity, of the mineral matter\r\nheld in solution by them. It is to be noted that the table shows the\r\ncomposition of the waters of exceptional, rather than common, lakes.\r\nThe waters of fresh lakes do not depart widely from those of rivers (p.\r\n107).\r\n\r\n            TABLE—ANALYSES OF THE WATERS OF INCLOSED LAKES.\r\n        [+Reduced to Parts per 1000 by Dr. H.

VII.\r\n\r\n                   THE ORIGIN AND DESCENT OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the current opinion that the earth was once in a molten\r\nstate, and thence cooled to a solid condition, and hence that all the\r\nprimitive rocks were igneous. Even those who think that the earth may\r\nnever have passed through a molten state agree that the oldest known\r\nrocks are either true igneous rocks, or rocks of very similar nature. A\r\nmolten magma may, therefore, be taken as the mother state of the rocks.\r\nStarting with this conception, the natural order of events suggests the\r\ninquiries (1) how rocks are formed from molten magmas, (2) what natures\r\nthey assume, (3) how other rocks are derived from them, (4) how still\r\nother rocks are derived from these derivatives, and so on. To answer\r\nthese inquiries is to trace out the generations of rocks and learn the\r\ngeneral history of rock-formation.\r\n\r\n(1) The process by which igneous rocks are formed from lavas is\r\nactually taking place in existing volcanoes. As these are widely\r\nscattered over the face of the earth, the material poured out by\r\nthem represents different parts of the interior and varies in nature\r\naccordingly. This affords the means of studying the differences that\r\narise from differences of material. This is a radical consideration,\r\nfor variations in composition give rise to the most fundamental\r\ndistinctions between rocks, though by no means the only ones. Rocks\r\nwhich have the same composition often differ greatly in texture or\r\nstructure, owing to the varying conditions under which they were\r\nformed. In the solidification of rocks from the molten state, the\r\nrate of cooling causes many differences. A means of studying this is\r\nafforded by the various lava flows that are now being poured out on\r\nthe surface under different conditions; but a more important means is\r\nafforded by extinct volcanoes, especially by those which have been\r\ndeeply cut open by erosion. In certain very ancient volcanoes, not\r\nonly have the solidified lava streams of the surface been cut across\r\nby erosion, but the lava that remained in the crater, or in the neck\r\nthat led up from below, is laid bare for inspection. Exposures of even\r\nmore profound nature have been made by the great disruptions which\r\nthe outer part of the crust has suffered. In certain tracts there have\r\nbeen profound fractures, and the formations on one side of these have\r\nsettled down and on the other side have been pushed up (faulted), so as\r\nto expose parts that were once much below the surface. Sometimes also\r\nthe crust has been folded and crumpled, and the wrinkles thus formed\r\nhave afterwards been worn away or cut open by deep valleys, and rocks\r\nthat were once deeply buried have been laid bare. By the revelations\r\nmade in these and other ways, it has been learned that at various times\r\nin the history of the earth molten matter has been thrust into fissures\r\nor intruded between layers of the crust and cooled there, without\r\ncoming to the surface. Sometimes the lava appears to have forced its\r\nway into the rocks, and sometimes to have lifted the upper beds and\r\nformed great subterranean layers or tumor-like aggregates, called\r\nbathyliths and laccoliths (Fig. 334). Such intruded bodies of molten\r\nrock, solidifying under the varying conditions of such subterranean\r\nsituations, are a fruitful source of instruction respecting the\r\ninfluence of varying rates and modes of cooling, as well as of other\r\nattendant conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 334.—Diagram of a laccolith. (Gilbert.)]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be readily seen that the rate of cooling of the various\r\nmolten rocks must have differed very greatly. In the portions\r\npoured out upon the surface there were sometimes narrow streams and\r\nthin sheets, giving large exposure in proportion to the mass (Fig.\r\n335), and sometimes thick flows and deep pondings in basins and\r\nchoked valleys, giving massive bodies with relatively small surface\r\nexposure. There were explosions of the lava into minute particles\r\nwith almost instantaneous cooling, and there were eruptions beneath\r\nthe sea the peculiar effects of which are rather matters of inference\r\nthan of positive knowledge. In the portions underground there were\r\ninsinuations into thin fissures, on the one hand, and in-thrustings of\r\nthick bodies, on the other. Some intrusions entered the upper part of\r\nthe crust where the rocks were cold and wet, and some were thrust into\r\nthe deeper portions where the rocks were warmer and less penetrated\r\nby water. Sometimes the lava rose rapidly and was little cooled in\r\npassage, sometimes slowly with more cooling en route, and sometimes\r\nthere were long halts between eruptions, with much opportunity to cool.\r\nAn almost infinite variety of conditions is thus presented, and with it\r\na rich field for the study of the modes of solidification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 335.—Fresh lava flow, with large surface\r\n  exposure. Holemaumau, Hawaii. (Libbey.)]\r\n\r\nIn the underground intrusions the additional factor of high pressure\r\nwas also present, and this is the third important condition in\r\ndetermining the nature of igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe three factors, _composition_, _rate of cooling_, and _degree of\r\npressure_, require special consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Composition of Igneous Rocks._\r\n\r\nAll or nearly all the chemical elements known on the earth are found\r\nin greater or less amounts in igneous rocks, and in a broad sense are\r\nconstituents of them. If there are any exceptions, they are most likely\r\nto be found in the rarer elements in the atmosphere. Oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, aqueous vapor, and carbonic acid, which make up the mass of\r\nthe present atmosphere, are all found in lavas and in their cooled\r\nproducts. Probably all the rarer elements also occur in igneous rocks.\r\nHelium is known to be given forth by springs.\r\n\r\n=Leading elements.=—But although nearly or quite all the known chemical\r\nelements enter into the igneous rocks, only a few of them are abundant.\r\nThese are regarded as normal or essential constituents, while the rarer\r\nsubstances are regarded as incidental. By combining a large number of\r\nthe most trustworthy analyses of rocks of all sorts, F. W. Clarke[199]\r\nhas estimated the relative amounts of the more abundant elements in the\r\ncrust of the earth with the following result:\r\n\r\n                           Percent. in\r\n  Element.

Many that are of the utmost importance in the history\r\nof the earth and the affairs of men are low in the list, or do not\r\neven appear in it at all, because their quantity is too small to be\r\nestimated in percentages. The precious metals, and even some of the\r\nmore common metals, as lead, zinc, and copper, are too scarce to form\r\nan appreciable percentage.\r\n\r\n=Union of elements.=—In a general study of the igneous rocks we may\r\nfor the present neglect all but the first eight of these elements.\r\nOut of these elements spring various chemical combinations, and out\r\nof these combinations spring the various minerals, and out of the\r\ncombinations of minerals come the various rocks. The union of oxygen\r\nwith the other seven elements may be taken as a fundamental step in\r\nthis series of combinations. The result is the following oxides: Silica\r\n(SiO₂), alumina (Al₂O₃), ferrous, ferric, and magnetic oxide (FeO,\r\nFe₂O₃, and Fe₃O₄), magnesia (MgO), calcium oxide or lime (CaO), soda\r\n(Na₂O), and potash (K₂O). The oxygen sometimes unites in proportions\r\ndifferent from those here given, but such exceptions may be neglected\r\nin a general study. We thus have nine leading oxides. Of these, silica\r\nacts as an acid, or more strictly according to the newer chemical view,\r\nas an acid anhydride. All the rest, except the magnetic oxide of iron,\r\nand sometimes the oxide of aluminum, act as basic oxides.\r\n\r\nIn the older chemical philosophy these oxides were supposed to combine\r\nby the simple union of an acid oxide with a basic oxide, and to remain\r\nas oxide joined to oxide; thus silica (SiO₂) and lime (CaO) formed\r\nsilicate of lime (CaO,Si₂). The symbols express the idea better than\r\nthe words. This method is used in the older geological works and in\r\nsome of the later. But in the newer chemical doctrine, the oxides are\r\nnot believed to remain so distinct after their union, and the symbols\r\nare written CaSiO₃, and the compound is named calcium silicate.\r\nAccording to the modern doctrine of solution, some of the calcium,\r\nsilicon, and oxygen may exist as free ions in molten rock. The precise\r\nway in which the elements are related to each other in these compounds\r\ncan scarcely be said to be known. For the general purposes of geology\r\nit is most convenient to think of these oxides as uniting in the\r\nsimple fashion first named, and this involves no apparent geological\r\nerror in general studies, since they are oxides when they enter the\r\ncompound, and if the compound is decomposed they usually come forth\r\nagain as oxides; but in closer studies more complex unions, attended by\r\ndissociations (ionization), must be recognized.\r\n\r\n=Formation of minerals.=—As but one of the leading oxides that abound\r\nin an average magma plays the part of an acid, the silica, a very\r\nsimple conception of the general nature of igneous rocks may be\r\nreached by noting that they are mostly silicates of the seven leading\r\nbasic oxides—alumina, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, and the iron\r\noxides. This general idea is a very useful one and represents a most\r\nimportant truth; but in its use we must not forget that there are many\r\nexceptions. Sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, and other elements unite\r\nwith the bases to form sulphates, sulphides, phosphates, phosphides,\r\nchlorides, etc. So also there are many minor bases that form silicates;\r\nand these minor bases unite with the minor acids to form many more or\r\nless rare minerals. Again, there are native metals in some igneous\r\nrocks. But altogether these hardly reach more than one or two percent.\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two exceptions of more importance. In the molten\r\nmagma the acid and basic elements are not always evenly matched. When\r\nthere is an excess of silica, a portion remains free and takes the\r\nform of quartz (SiO₂). If there is an excess of the basic oxides, the\r\nweakest one is usually left out of the combination. This is commonly\r\nthe iron oxide, which then usually takes the form of magnetite (Fe₃O₄).\r\nIt is a singular fact that quartz often forms when there is no excess\r\nof silica, and magnetite when there is no excess of base. Quartz\r\n(free acid anhydride) and magnetite (free basic oxide) sometimes\r\noccur in the same rock. The explanation for this is yet to be found.\r\nThese form rather important exceptions to the generalization that the\r\nigneous rocks are mostly made up of silicates, but, thus qualified,\r\nit expresses the essential truth, and has the merit of embodying the\r\ncentral chemical fact relative to these rocks.\r\n\r\n=Sources of complexity.=—But here simplicity ends. As we pass on to\r\nthe specific silicates that are formed, we encounter several sources\r\nof complexity. In the first place, the silica unites with the bases in\r\ndifferent ratios and thus gives rise to unisilicates or orthosilicates\r\n(ratio of oxygen of bases to oxygen of silica, 1:1), subsilicates\r\n(ratio more than 1), bisilicates (ratio 1:2), trisilicates or\r\npolysilicates (ratio 1:3 or higher), and combinations of these. All the\r\nbases are not known to combine in all these ways, but many do in more\r\nthan one of them. Still, if the silica were content to unite with each\r\nof the bases by itself alone, the results would remain comparatively\r\nsimple; but instead of this it unites with two or more at the same\r\ntime; and, more than that, it unites with them in varying amounts. The\r\ncase would still remain measurably simple if these chemical compounds\r\nalways crystallized out by themselves, each compound forming one\r\nmineral, and but one; but the different silicates have the confusing\r\nhabit of crystallizing together in the same mineral. A crystal\r\nmay thus sometimes be seen, under the microscope, to be made up of\r\nalternating layers of different silicates; e.g., a microscopic layer\r\nof an aluminum-calcium silicate may be overlain by a microscopic layer\r\nof an aluminum-sodium silicate, and the alternation may be repeated\r\nthroughout the crystal, giving it a banded structure. There is reason\r\nto believe that this is true in many cases where the microscope fails\r\nto detect it, and that less symmetrical comminglings of silicates may\r\ntake place. As such alternations or mixtures are not governed by any\r\nknown mathematical law, as is the case in chemical compounds, there is\r\nno determinate limit to the number of combinations that may arise. As\r\na matter of fact, new ones are still being discovered in the progress\r\nof research, and the total number that may ultimately be found can\r\nscarcely be prophesied.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this fertility of combination, the total number of\r\nsilicious minerals in igneous rocks is large. It is the function of the\r\nmineralogist to treat of these minerals as such. The geologist deals\r\nwith them as constituents of the earth and as factors in its history.\r\nOnly a few of them are so abundant as to require special individual\r\nnotice in a general study of the earth. It may be remarked also that\r\nonly a few of them can be identified by simple inspection as they\r\noccur in the rocks, partly because of the delicacy of the distinctions\r\nbetween many of them, and partly because of their minuteness and\r\nintricate intermixture. The resources of the polarizing microscope\r\nare necessary for safe determination in most cases. The student need\r\nnot feel embarrassment or discouragement if he is often unable to\r\nrecognize the constituents of the intimately crystalline rocks. Their\r\ndetermination has grown to be a profession by itself.\r\n\r\n=The leading minerals of igneous rocks.=—Fortunately for the simplicity\r\nof geological study, a few minerals make up the great mass of the\r\nigneous rocks. These few are _quartz_, the _feldspathic minerals_,\r\nthe _ferromagnesian minerals_, and the _iron oxides_. Quartz (silica,\r\nSiO₂) is the free acid already mentioned. The feldspathic and\r\nferromagnesian minerals are the leading silicates of the earth’s crust,\r\nand vastly surpass all others in abundance. The feldspathic group\r\nembraces minerals formed by silica in union with alumina, together\r\nwith either potash, soda, or lime, or two or more of these together.\r\nThe ferromagnesian group embraces minerals formed by the union of\r\nsilica with iron, magnesia, and lime, together with more or less of the\r\nother basic oxides. These statements are only true in a very general\r\nsense. Admixtures, replacements, and impurities are so frequent as to\r\nbreak down all sharp, simple definitions. The feldspathic minerals\r\nare normally light in color, ranging from white to red or gray. The\r\nferromagnesian minerals are normally dark (commonly greenish) from the\r\npresence of iron, the great coloring element of rocks. But these color\r\ndistinctions do not hold good in detail and cannot be much trusted as a\r\nmeans of identification.\r\n\r\n=The feldspathic minerals= (p. 462) embrace the potash feldspars,\r\n_orthoclase_ and _microcline_; the soda feldspar, _albite_; the lime\r\nfeldspar, _anorthite_; and the mixed feldspars intermediate between\r\nalbite and anorthite, viz., the soda-lime feldspar, _oligoclase_, the\r\nlime-soda feldspar, _andesine_, in which lime and soda are nearly\r\nequal, and the lime-soda feldspar, _labradorite_, in which the lime\r\npredominates; together with _leucite_, a potash silicate higher in\r\nalkali than orthoclase, and _nephelite_, a soda silicate higher in\r\nsoda than albite. Leucite and nephelite are usually classified as\r\n_feldspathoids_, not as feldspars. It is to be understood that alumina\r\nis normally present in all these. Additional details respecting these\r\nminerals may be found in the reference list, p. 460.\r\n\r\nAmong the =ferromagnesian minerals= the most important are the\r\npyroxenes, the amphiboles, and the biotite type of mica. Olivine is\r\nof subordinate importance. The pyroxenes (p. 465) and amphiboles\r\n(p. 460) have nearly the same chemical composition, but differ in\r\ncrystallization and physical properties. _Hornblende_ (an amphibole)\r\nhas been melted, and on cooling under proper conditions found to take\r\non the form of _augite_ (a pyroxene). Pyroxene is sometimes altered\r\ninto _uralite_, one of the amphiboles. The pyroxenes and amphiboles\r\nare the most abundant of the dark minerals in crystalline rocks.\r\nThe leading members of the pyroxene group are _augite_, _diallage_,\r\n_hypersthene_, _enstatite_, and _soda pyroxene_. The chief members of\r\nthe amphibole group are _hornblende_ and the _soda amphiboles_. All are\r\nessentially silicates of magnesia and iron oxide, with or without the\r\naddition of lime, soda, and alumina. Details respecting these may be\r\nfound in the reference list.\r\n\r\nThe two leading =micas= are the iron-magnesia mica, _biotite_, and the\r\npotash mica, _muscovite_, the familiar “isinglass” of the stove-door.\r\nChemically, muscovite should go with the potash feldspars, but it\r\nis distinguished from them by its crystalline habit and physical\r\nproperties. The biotite should go chemically with the pyroxenes and\r\namphiboles, which it closely resembles except in its crystalline\r\nproperties. Details respecting the micas may be found in the reference\r\nlist, p. 464.\r\n\r\nTwo =iron oxides=, magnetite (Fe₃O₄) and hematite (Fe₂O₃) are widely\r\ndisseminated in igneous rocks. They constitute the free bases already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n=Summary of salient facts.=—The salient facts are, therefore, (1) that\r\nout of the seventy-odd chemical elements in the earth, eight form the\r\nchief part of it; (2) that one of these elements uniting with the rest\r\nforms nine leading oxides; (3) that one of these oxides acts as an\r\nacid and the rest as bases; (4) that by their combination they form a\r\nseries of silicates of which a few are easily chief; (5) that these\r\nsilicates crystallize into a multitude of minerals of which again a few\r\nare chief; and (6) that these minerals are aggregated in various ways\r\nto form rocks. Possessed of these leading ideas, we are prepared to\r\nturn to the consideration of some of the conditions under which these\r\ncombinations take place in the formation of rocks from molten magmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE NATURE OF MOLTEN MAGMAS.\r\n\r\nWe easily fall into the habit of thinking of molten rock as we think\r\nof a molten metal, merely as a substance which has passed from the\r\nsolid to the liquid condition because of high temperature. With the\r\nreturn of low temperature a molten metal returns to the solid state\r\nusually in the same molecular condition which it possessed before.\r\nThe point of fusion and the point of solidification are the same and\r\nare rigidly fixed. If this were true of the constituents of a rock,\r\na definite order for the solidification of the several minerals\r\nmight be anticipated. As a matter of fact, the order is not the\r\nsame under all conditions, and, what is especially significant, the\r\norder is far from being that in which the constituents would fuse\r\nor would solidify separately. For instance, in a granite composed\r\nchiefly of quartz, feldspar, and mica, the quartz is often the last\r\nto take form, although it is more infusible than the feldspar or the\r\nmica. This and other phenomena show that a molten magma is not to be\r\nviewed simply as a fused substance, but rather as a _solution_ of\r\none silicate in another, or as a solution of several silicates in\r\none another mutually. The high temperature is to be regarded merely\r\nas a condition prerequisite to solution, or as the condition of\r\nfusion of some one constituent which then dissolves the others. If\r\ncrystals of snow, sugar, and salt be mixed at a low temperature and\r\ncompacted, the mass may be regarded as an artificial rock. On raising\r\nthe temperature, all will pass into solution while the temperature is\r\nstill somewhat below the melting-point of the snow, the most fusible,\r\nand while it is much below that of either the sugar or the salt. This\r\nparticular case is instructive because the ice is not simply fused by\r\ntemperature; the affinity of the salt plays a part. If the temperature\r\nwere again lowered, the sugar and salt would not crystallize out at\r\ntheir fusing-points, but would remain in solution down to and even\r\nbelow the normal freezing-point of water; in other words, they would\r\nremain in solution until the water crystallized out and forced them\r\nto take the solid state. This holds good when the amounts of the\r\nsugar and salt are small relative to the water. If, on the contrary,\r\ntheir quantity is large relatively, crystallization will take place\r\nat higher temperatures and before the water crystallizes to ice. From\r\nthis it appears that the salt and sugar might crystallize either before\r\nthe water or after it, according to the degree of concentration. The\r\nbehavior of mixtures of minerals in passing into and out of the molten\r\ncondition appears to be quite analogous to this, and hence a great\r\nvariety of results attend the process, dependent upon the number, the\r\nnature, and the relative quantities of the ingredients. The approved\r\nconception of the genesis of a rock from a molten magma (when ample\r\ntime is given) is that one compound after another crystallizes out\r\nas the temperature falls and its point of _saturation_ for each is\r\nreached, until the whole has been solidified. The modes of combination\r\nof the elements in the molten magma are not necessarily the same as\r\nthose in the derivative crystals; indeed, the combinations doubtless\r\nchange as the process proceeds; certain constituents being taken out,\r\nthe remaining ones probably rearrange themselves.\r\n\r\n=Time required in crystallization.=—The liquid magma of igneous rocks\r\nis essentially a fluid glass or slag. It is analogous to common glass,\r\nwhich is a silicate of potash, soda, or other base, except that\r\nusually common glass is relatively free from iron and other coloring\r\nsubstances, while these abound in the natural magmas and render them\r\ndark and more or less opaque; but the fundamental nature is the\r\nsame, except that the natural lavas are usually mixtures of several\r\nsilicates, while the artificial glasses consist of only one, or at most\r\na few. Furnace slag is essentially an artificial lava.\r\n\r\nWhen a lava is cooled quickly, the commingled silicates solidify in the\r\ndiffused condition essentially as they were in the liquid; for there\r\nis no time for the silicate molecules of a like kind to come together,\r\nparticle by particle, in regular systematic order, as required in\r\ncrystallization. The essential feature of crystallization is this\r\nsystematic arrangement of the molecules according to a definite plan,\r\ngiving a specific crystal form, as a cube, a hexagonal prism, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are six (sometimes made seven) fundamental systems of\r\ncrystallization, and a multitude of variations of special form in each\r\nsystem. The treatment of these forms belongs to mineralogy.\r\n\r\nIn a thick viscid liquid, this systematic arrangement of molecules\r\ninto definite crystal forms takes place slowly, for the crystalline\r\nforce in the silicates is far less energetic than that in water,\r\nwhich crystallizes into ice with much rapidity and with great force.\r\nBecause of this slowness, the solidification of the lava may catch\r\nthe process of crystallization at any stage. If the lava is cooled\r\nquickly, the result is a glass; if less quickly, part glass and part\r\ncrystals; if slowly enough, all becomes crystalline. In general the\r\nslower the growth the larger the crystals. The solidification product\r\nmay, therefore, range from a glass to a mass of crystals; i.e., it may\r\nbe (1) wholly glass, (2) a glassy matrix with a few small crystals\r\nscattered through it, (3) a less abundant glassy matrix with more and\r\nlarger crystals, (4) a mere remnant of glass in a mass of crystals, or\r\n(5) a mass of crystals with no glass.\r\n\r\n=Successive stages of crystallization.=—Since eruptions take place\r\nintermittently, it is obvious that cooling of the lava may be in\r\nprogress in its hidden reservoir during the quiescent intervals between\r\neruptions. After a certain stage of partial crystallization has been\r\nreached during such time of quiet, a renewal of eruption may take place\r\nand the whole mass of lava be shifted into quite new conditions, and\r\na second phase of solidification may be superposed on the one already\r\nstarted. The rock will then show two phases of crystallization: (1)\r\nlarge crystals of the kind or kinds most prone to develop in the given\r\nlava may have grown during the first long stage of slow subterranean\r\ncooling, while the greater part of the lava still remained liquid; and\r\n(2) small crystals or glass may have developed when the more rapid\r\ncooling under the new conditions took place. The result would be large\r\ncrystals set in a matrix of small crystals or of glass, a combination\r\nstyled _porphyritic_. In such cases the lava, in its later stages,\r\ncarries the large crystals floating throughout its mass, and is not a\r\nsimple liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE FRAGMENTAL PRODUCTS OF SUDDEN COOLING.\r\n\r\n=Pyroclastic rocks.=—The extreme example of sudden cooling is presented\r\nwhen lavas are violently exploded into the air and solidify almost\r\ninstantly. The resulting glassy particles or filaments, if small,\r\nconstitute _volcanic ash_. The explosion appears to be due to steam and\r\nother gases which are held in the deeper lava under great pressure, but\r\nwhich, as they rise toward the surface of the lava where the pressure\r\nis relieved, expand with explosive violence. It is probably also due in\r\npart to progressive crystallization, which forces the gases out from\r\nthe part that crystallizes and overcharges the rest. Sometimes the\r\nprojected particles draw after themselves long _filaments_ like the\r\nthreads of spun glass, and sometimes while in the air they divide and\r\ndraw apart, spinning a filament of viscid lava between them. A variety\r\nof this kind at the volcano of Kilauea in Hawaii is known as “Pele’s\r\nhair.” These light filaments drift with the wind and lodge on the lee\r\nside of the volcano, covering the surface “like mown grass” (Dana).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 336.—Volcanic bomb. About half natural size.\r\n  (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the exploded fragments are coarser they fall about the volcanic\r\nvent and form the _tuffs_ (_tufa_) of which most steep volcanic cones\r\nare chiefly built. In these larger fragments, crystals are not\r\ninfrequently found, and the same is even true of the volcanic ash.\r\nThese crystals are undoubtedly such as had already been formed in the\r\nlava before it exploded, and their formation, as suggested above, may\r\nhave contributed to the explosion.\r\n\r\nFragments too large to be borne far away by the air, but still small,\r\nare known as _lapilli_, especially if they are somewhat rounded and\r\ngravel-like. A finer variety, of the nature of sand, much used in\r\nmaking Portland cement, is locally known as _puzzolana_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 337.—Volcanic bomb of unusual form, 13 foot long.\r\n  Cinder Buttes, Idaho. (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe rougher, irregular fragments of a clinker-like nature ejected by\r\nvolcanoes are known as _scoriæ_ or _cinders_. They are more or less\r\ndistended by gas-bubbles and are hence light and pumiceous.\r\n\r\nThe larger masses of lava ejected into the air are often caused to\r\nrotate by the unequal force of the projection, or by the unequal\r\nfriction of the air, and to assume spheroidal forms, the internal gases\r\nat the same time often expanding and rendering the mass vesicular.\r\nThese rounded projectiles are known as _volcanic bombs_ (Figs. 336 and\r\n337). Balls of lava that have originated in rolling movements of the\r\nseething mass, or in other ways, are also styled bombs. Usage is not\r\naltogether harmonious or consistent in the application of the term.\r\n\r\nThe larger masses that are projected into the air are more or less\r\nvesicular from the expansion of included gases, as already noted, and\r\nso the fragmental products of volcanic action grade into the vesicular.\r\nThe type of this class is _pumice_, in which the gas cavities make up\r\nby far the larger part of the volume of the whole mass, and the whole\r\nis reduced to the condition of a solidified froth or foam. So thin are\r\nthe dividing films of glassy material in some cases that the whole is\r\npure white, though the same material in solid mass would be dark. This\r\nsolidified glassy froth is often lighter than water and floats freely\r\non the sea until it becomes “water-logged” and sinks. Dredgings of\r\nthe deep sea show that much pumice has accumulated there, and being\r\nfar from the land has escaped burial by the sediments borne in by the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nAll of these fragmental rocks produced by volcanic action are known\r\nas _pyroclastic_ (fire-fragmented) rocks, a general term of much\r\nconvenience in distinguishing them from lava-flows, on the one hand,\r\nand from the fragmental rocks produced by air and water (ordinary\r\nclastics), on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE GLASSY ROCKS.\r\n\r\n=The solid glasses.=—The quick cooling of lava-flows into solid glasses\r\nis chiefly dependent on their exposure at the surface. Hence it is\r\noften the case that the exterior of a lava-flow is glassy in greater\r\nor lesser degree, while the interior is more or less crystalline.\r\nQuick cooling is sometimes also due to the intrusion of the lava in\r\nthin sheets into fissures in cold rocks. When massive bodies of lavas\r\npenetrate solid rocks, the lava does not usually cool so fast as to\r\nprevent some degree of crystallization, and the crystallization may\r\neven become complete; but if the intruded lava sheet be very thin,\r\nthe lava is liable to be cooled to a nearly perfect glass. The glassy\r\ncondition is, therefore, subject to indefinite gradations. As a rule,\r\nthe acid lavas are stiffer at the same temperature than the basic ones,\r\nand crystallize more slowly, so that acid glasses are more common than\r\nbasic ones. The basic rocks usually crystallize pretty thoroughly,\r\nexcept on the immediate surface of the flows.\r\n\r\n=The first stages of crystallization.=—The microscopic study of the\r\nvolcanic glasses reveals great numbers of minute forms known as\r\n_crystallites_, _microlites_, _globulites_, etc., that appear to\r\nbe first steps in crystallization, though many of them do not take\r\ndefinite geometrical shapes and some do not show the optical characters\r\nof crystals. There are minute globules (globulites), needles, and\r\nhair-like bodies (trichites) of more or less indeterminate nature,\r\ntogether with other forms that can be seen to be certainly the initial\r\nforms of well-known minerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 338.—Flow structure in rhyolite. Nearly natural\r\n  size. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n=The obsidians.=—Of the compact glassy rocks, _obsidian_ is the best\r\ntype. It is essentially a natural glass, formed usually of acid\r\nsilicates. It has the close texture, conchoidal fracture, and other\r\nqualities of glass. It is usually black, but sometimes red, brown,\r\npurple, bluish, or gray. While chiefly of glass, it usually contains\r\nmore or less of the incipient crystals above described, showing\r\nthat even here the first step in the gradation to the next or the\r\ncrystalline stage has been taken. These incipient crystals sometimes\r\nbecome so abundant as to change the texture from the vitreous to the\r\nstony order. In some cases, the stony texture seems to have been\r\ndeveloped in the obsidian after it was formed, the change being a part\r\nof a subsequent process of devitrification, but in other cases the\r\ncrystals seem to be original. Besides these, there are often small\r\nglobular bodies known as spherulites.\r\n\r\nVarieties of glassy rock in which the embryo crystals are more numerous\r\nand the glassy texture less perfect, are known as _pitchstones_. The\r\nfresh surfaces of these have rather the aspect of pitch or resin\r\nthan that of true glass; hence their name. Like the obsidians, they\r\nare usually dark, but they take on greenish, brownish, yellowish,\r\nand light-colored hues as well. Sometimes glassy rock fractures in\r\nsmall spheroidal forms like pearls, and is known as _perlite_. Basic\r\nglasses are relatively rare, and while usually included under the term\r\nobsidian, are sometimes given special names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 339.—Flow structure in volcanic glass.

(Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPECIAL STRUCTURES.\r\n\r\n=Flow structure.=—Lavas that cool into glassy rocks frequently contain\r\ngas cavities, colored spots and variations of texture which, together\r\nwith the hair-like embryo crystals, are drawn out into lines, streaks,\r\nand parallel belts by the flow of the viscous mass, giving rise to\r\n_rhyolitic_ or flow structure (Figs. 338 and 339). Rocks in which this\r\nis the most pronounced feature were formerly known as rhyolites, though\r\nthe term has drifted away from this original meaning and has been\r\napplied to a class of acidic rocks. The obsidians and pitchstones may\r\nbe more or less rhyolitic under the microscope, though to the naked\r\neye they may appear only as a glassy or resinous mass. The rhyolites\r\ngenerally have but an imperfect glassy texture, since the crystals\r\nand the cavities sometimes make up a notable part of the mass, the\r\nglassy portion being scarcely more than a matrix in which the crystals,\r\nspherulites, and cavities are carried. By an increase of the crystals\r\nin number and size, the rock passes by gradations into porphyry or\r\nphanerite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 342.—Porphyritic texture. Two-thirds natural\r\n  size. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n=Amygdaloids.=—In lava-flows the included steam often collects in\r\nbubbles near the surface as the lava cools and forms a vesicular\r\nportion with a scoriaceous texture (Fig. 341). In its upper part,\r\nthe vapor bubbles may be numerous, while below they become more and\r\nmore scattered until they disappear. Similar bubbles are also often\r\nfound near the bottom of a sheet of lava. This is perhaps due to the\r\nrolling under of the frontal surface of the lava-stream as it flows.\r\nLater, these cavities often become filled with minerals deposited from\r\nsolution and the rock then becomes an amygdaloid, but this filling is a\r\nsecondary action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 343.—Porphyritic texture. Natural size. (Photo.\r\n  by Church.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE PORPHYRITIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions are such that after a part of the magma has formed\r\ndistinct crystals floating in the remaining liquid lava, there is\r\na change which causes the rest to solidify as a glass or as a mass\r\nof small crystals, the structure is known as _porphyritic_, and the\r\nrocks possessing it are called _porphyries_. This differentiation into\r\ndistinct crystals set in a ground-mass of minute crystals or of glass\r\noften gives a mottled or variegated aspect to the rock, especially\r\nif the matrix of glass or minute crystals differs in color from the\r\ndistinct crystals. This structure is much oftener developed in acidic\r\nrocks than in basic ones, because the latter crystallize more readily.\r\nThe most common porphyritic crystals are feldspar and quartz, though\r\nthey are by no means the only ones. The matrix is also usually felsitic\r\nor quartzose, but not necessarily so. The character is a structural\r\none, and is not dependent upon any special chemical or mineralogical\r\nconstitution. The distinct crystals are known as phenocrysts, and the\r\nvarieties of porphyries are named from the characteristic phenocryst,\r\ne.g., quartzophyre (quartz-porphyry) if the conspicuous crystals\r\nare quartz, orthophyre if orthoclase, augitophyre if augite, etc. A\r\nconvenient classification has recently been proposed[200] into (1)\r\n_leucophyre_ (white porphyries), which have a light-colored ground-mass\r\nset with phenocrysts of any kind, and (2) _melaphyres_ (black\r\nporphyries), which have a dark-colored ground-mass, with phenocrysts\r\nof any kind. While it is to be hoped this usage will prevail, it is to\r\nbe noted that these terms, especially the latter, have been used in a\r\ndifferent sense. (See reference list of rocks, p. 445.)\r\n\r\nIn many cases the ground-mass itself becomes minutely crystalline\r\nand the porphyritic aspect is due simply to large distinct crystals\r\nset in a mass of minute obscure ones. The rock is then really\r\n_holocrystalline_, but the term porphyry is applied to it. In other\r\nrocks the crystals of the ground-mass become more and more distinct,\r\nthe porphyritic aspect gradually disappears, and there is a graduation\r\ninto the next class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PHANEROCRYSTALLINE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n=The phanerites.=—When time enough is given for the cooling process the\r\nmolten magma becomes completely crystalline. The holocrystalline rocks\r\nhence include a large series, ranging from the most acid to the most\r\nbasic. In this class the differentiation of the rock material and the\r\nformation of distinct minerals reach a high stage, and as a natural\r\nresult the varieties of rock are numerous. Taken as a group they are\r\nphanerites. If they are to be more particularly characterized, it is\r\nusually done on the basis of the minerals of which they are composed.\r\nThe following are the leading types, beginning with those which are\r\nrich in silica and poor in basic oxides, and ending with those which\r\nare rich in basic oxides and poor in silica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 344.—Granitic texture. About half natural size.\r\n  (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n=The granites.=—The term granite was originally used to designate\r\na granular, i.e., a distinctly crystalline, rock, and it is still\r\npopularly and properly so used. In scientific treatises it has usually\r\nbeen confined to a special aggregate of crystals of quartz, feldspar,\r\nand mica. It has recently been proposed to give it again a more general\r\napplication, though not quite its original one, by including under it\r\nall holocrystalline rocks composed of dominant quartz and feldspar\r\nof any kind, with mica, hornblende, or other minerals in subordinate\r\namount. In scientific literature as it now stands, granite consists of\r\nquartz, feldspar, and mica, the feldspar being of the alkali-potash\r\nor soda variety (orthoclase, microcline, or albite), and the mica,\r\neither muscovite or biotite. In the type form the crystals are distinct\r\nand sometimes large (Fig. 344). They are intimately mingled with one\r\nanother, and in growing, interfered more or less with each other and\r\nso became interlocked. The granites are among the most common and\r\neasily recognized of the holocrystalline rocks. Their color is mainly\r\ndependent upon the feldspar, the red and pink varieties of the mineral\r\ngiving rise to red granite, and the white varieties to gray granite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 345.—Graphic granitic (or pegmatitic) texture.\r\n  Nearly natural size. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\nVery few granites conform strictly to the type. They vary by the\r\naddition and substitution of other minerals, and these sometimes\r\nbecome as prominent as the type minerals. The soda-lime feldspars\r\nsometimes take the place of the orthoclase, or accompany it; hornblende\r\nand other minerals take the place of the biotite, or occur with it;\r\nand so on. Whenever one of these replacing or accessory minerals is\r\nnotable in quantity, its name is often prefixed, as hornblende-granite,\r\noligoclase-granite, zircon-granite, etc. In this way the rock grades\r\nalmost insensibly into the syenites, diorites, etc. Variations also\r\narise from the absence of one of the three leading minerals. If mica\r\nis absent, the rock is termed an _aplite_ (quartz and feldspar). If\r\nthe feldspar is absent, it is called a _greisen_ (quartz and mica).\r\nIf quartz is absent, it is termed a _minette_ (feldspar and mica).\r\nThese varietal terms are neither universally nor always consistently\r\nused, and it is to be hoped they will be replaced by the systematic\r\nnomenclature recently proposed and outlined later (p. 451).\r\n\r\nThe granites were formed from a magma rich in silica, alumina, potash,\r\nand soda, but generally poor in lime, iron, and magnesia. Incidentally\r\nother substances were present. The alumina, potash, and other bases\r\nunited with so much of the silica as was required to form the feldspars\r\nand micas, and the remaining silica crystallized into quartz.\r\n\r\nGranite is normally a massive rock without foliation or banding. If\r\nit takes on these characters, it becomes a _gneiss_, and passes into\r\nthe foliated or schistose class of rocks, to be discussed later. The\r\ntexture of graphic granite (see pegmatite) is notably peculiar, due to\r\nthe simultaneous crystallization of the quartz and feldspar (Fig. 345).\r\n\r\n=The syenites.=—When the mica of a granite is replaced by hornblende,\r\nthe rock is now commonly known as a _hornblende-granite_, but it was\r\nformerly called _syenite_, because found at Syene on the Nile. The term\r\nsyenite is now applied to a rock consisting essentially of feldspar\r\nand hornblende or mica, but there is a complete gradation from the\r\ngranites to the syenites. The magma of the syenites was richer in\r\niron and magnesium than the typical granitic magma. The syenites also\r\ngrade into other classes, as do the granites, and are named by similar\r\nprefixes, as augite-syenite, etc., and some of these varieties have\r\nspecial names. The syenites are red or gray, according to the color of\r\nthe feldspar, and are usually darker than the granites. The texture of\r\nsyenite is like that of granite. In the scheme of field names recently\r\nproposed, syenite is made to include all holocrystalline rocks composed\r\nmainly of feldspar of any kind, with subordinate amounts of mica,\r\nhornblende, pyroxene, and other minerals, but without a noticeable\r\namount of quartz.\r\n\r\n=The diorites.=—These embrace rocks which were crystallized from a\r\nmagma still poorer in silica and the alkalies, and richer in the earthy\r\nbases. In composition they closely approach the ideal average rock,\r\nbut usually fall a little below it in silica and the alkalies, and\r\nrise a little above it in the earthy bases. In current usage, diorite\r\nis defined as an intimate mixture of crystals of hornblende and a\r\nplagioclase feldspar. It differs from the syenite in having plagioclase\r\nfeldspar instead of orthoclase. By substitutions and the addition of\r\naccessory minerals, the diorites graduate toward the granites and\r\nsyenites on the one hand, as already noted, and into gabbros on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the scheme recently proposed, all holocrystalline rocks in which\r\nhornblende is dominant and feldspar subordinate are classed as diorites.\r\n\r\n=The gabbros.=—The name gabbro was formerly applied to a coarse-grained\r\nbasic rock consisting of labradorite and diallage, but the name has\r\nbeen gradually extended until it embraces a large group of rocks that\r\nhave essentially the same composition as the dolerites mentioned below,\r\nbut are coarser in crystallization, and the crystals do not embrace one\r\nanother (i.e., are not ophitic). The principal minerals are plagioclase\r\n(normally labradorite) and pyroxene (normally diallage) with magnetite\r\nor ilmenite. They are usually dark, heavy rocks. The pearly luster of\r\nthe cleavage faces of the diallage, when present, gives a peculiar\r\nsheen to a fresh surface of the rock. In the recently proposed field\r\nnames, gabbro is made to include all phanerocrystalline rocks in which\r\npyroxene predominates, attended by feldspar of any kind in subordinate\r\nquantity, with or without hornblende or mica.\r\n\r\n=The peridotites.=—These stand at the basic end of the series, having\r\nbeen formed from a magma in which the silica was low (39–45 per cent.),\r\nas were also the alumina, lime, and alkalies, but in which the magnesia\r\nwas relatively very high, ranging from 35 to 48 per cent. The rock\r\nconsists very largely of olivine associated with pyroxene, magnetite,\r\nand other very basic minerals. Little or no feldspar is present. The\r\nperidotites are much less abundant than the preceding classes and\r\nrepresent a very distinctive phase of the magma in which the magnesia\r\nwas greatly concentrated.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the peridotites are rocks which are made up largely\r\nof a single basic mineral, as _augitite_, _pyroxenite_, _hornblendite_,\r\nrocks essentially formed of the minerals augite, pyroxene, and\r\nhornblende respectively. It will be noted that in these rocks the magma\r\nbecame quite simple in nature, just as at the acid end of the series\r\ncertain rocks become comparatively simple from the concentration of the\r\nacid element, as in certain acidic granites, felsites, etc. (See pp.\r\n523–524.)\r\n\r\n=The basalts.=—The term basalt is used in a somewhat comprehensive\r\nway to embrace dark, compact, igneous rocks that appear to be nearly\r\nhomogeneous, owing to the minuteness of the crystals, which are\r\nusually so small as to be identifiable only under the microscope.\r\nIn some cases the crystals are scattered throughout a ground-mass\r\nafter the porphyritic fashion. In some of these cases there is a true\r\nglassy base, and in such cases the rock does not strictly belong in\r\nthe holocrystalline group. In the more typical cases the constituent\r\nminerals are very minutely crystallized and intimately intermixed. The\r\nleading minerals are plagioclase (usually labradorite or anorthite)\r\nand pyroxene (usually augite), with olivine and magnetite or ilmenite\r\nusually present. There is a considerable range in chemical nature,\r\nbut the basalts are relatively poor in silica, usually also low in\r\npotash and soda, but rich in lime, magnesia, and the iron oxides. They\r\nare classed as basic and are sometimes highly so. The magmas of the\r\nbasalts are especially fluid, and when poured forth upon the surface\r\neasily spread out in thin sheets. In cooling they are prone to take on\r\na columnar or basaltic structure, the columns standing at right angles\r\nto the surfaces exposed to cooling. The columns are sometimes curved,\r\nowing to the peculiar attitude of the cooling surface. The columns of\r\nGiant’s Causeway and Fingal’s Cave are familiar examples.\r\n\r\n=The dolerites.=—The basalts graduate insensibly into the dolerites;\r\nindeed the dolerites may be regarded simply as basalts of coarser\r\ncrystallization. The minerals are evident to the eye and range up\r\nto medium size. The more abundant minerals are plagioclase feldspar\r\n(labradorite or anorthite), with one or more of the ferromagnesian\r\nminerals (augite, olivine, or biotite), and magnetite or ilmenite. In\r\nthe growth of the minerals one crystal frequently embraces others,\r\ngiving an ophitic structure. The dolerites have many varieties, due\r\neither to accessory minerals or to the development of some of the\r\nconstituents more amply than the rest. The type may be said to consist\r\nof plagioclase and augite, the other minerals being regarded as\r\naccessories. Magnetite or ilmenite is almost universally present. The\r\nvarieties are usually designated by prefixes, as olivine-dolerite,\r\nenstatite-dolerite, etc., but special names are also used for some of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 346.—Conglomerate, Carboniferous series. Bancroft\r\n  Place, Newport, R. I. (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe ancient dolerites have usually undergone internal changes and\r\nsuch rocks are often called _diabases_. While the use of the term has\r\nnot been uniform, it accords with the better practice to regard the\r\ndiabases simply as partially altered dolerites and basalts. In general,\r\ntherefore, the diabases are but ancient dolerites.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _General names._\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of distinguishing many of the foregoing rocks from each\r\nother by any means available in the field, owing to the minuteness\r\nof the crystals, and to the gradation of one type of rock into\r\nanother, makes it desirable to employ certain general names which will\r\ncorrectly express the leading character of the rock without implying a\r\nknowledge of the precise mineral composition. A convenient term of this\r\nkind is _greenstone_, which merely indicates that the ferromagnesian\r\nminerals are prominent and usually give a greenish or dark cast to the\r\nrock. The greenstones embrace the diorites, dolerites, some of the\r\ngabbros and the basalts, and may even extend to the peridotites and\r\nsome of the more hornblendic of the granitoid rocks. Another convenient\r\nname is _trap_, which may be used for any dark, heavy igneous rock. The\r\nname (from _trappe_, stairs) refers to the step-like arrangement which\r\nthe edges of the superimposed sheets of lava often take, especially\r\nwhen the lava is of the free-flowing, basaltic kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 347.—Brecciated limestone, Calciferous formation.\r\n  One mile south of Highgate Falls, Vt.]\r\n\r\nThe term basalt is sometimes used to embrace any of the very\r\nfine-grained dark igneous rocks. In such cases, it covers the very\r\nfine-grained dolerites, diorites, peridotites, etc. The term granite\r\nwas used originally for any coarse-grained crystalline rock, and there\r\nis a tendency to revive this early use. In general descriptions, some\r\nof our best petrographers call any coarsely crystalline rock (e.g.,\r\ncoarse-grained syenites, diorites, gabbros, etc.) granite. The term\r\n_granitoids_ may be used with strict propriety to cover all rocks of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DERIVATION OF SECONDARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\nRocks, though commonly made the symbol of the abiding, are subject\r\nto constant slow changes. Through these changes newer rocks have\r\nbeen derived from older ones, and still others in turn from these\r\nderivatives, and so on in an endless chain. All derived rocks are\r\nconveniently termed secondary, though they may be several generations\r\nremoved from the primitive rocks, and even the primitive rocks, as we\r\nnow understand them, may be themselves derived. The ordinary changes\r\nof rock are most active at or near the surface, and the processes\r\nof such change have already been discussed in part under the titles\r\n“Weathering” (pp. 54 and 110), “Erosion” (pp. 119–123 and 342–349),\r\n“Transportation” (pp. 115–119 and 354–355), and “Deposition” (pp.\r\n177–204 and 355–363).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 348.—Quartzitic breccia.

(Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n=Regolith.=—The first great product of the surface changes is\r\n_mantle-rock_ (_regolith_), which comprehends all the loose matter\r\nthat springs from rock decay, wear, fracture, and other forms of\r\ndisintegration. It lies in an unconsolidated sheet on the face of the\r\nland, whether as soil, sand, clay, earth, gravel, or loose rock.\r\n\r\n=Disrupted products: arkose and wacke.=—In dry regions, in cold\r\nregions, on mountain heights and precipitous slopes, and under other\r\nconditions where sudden changes of temperature and frost action work\r\nefficiently, rocks are broken down into fine fragments without much\r\nchemical decomposition. Such _disaggregated_ rather than decomposed\r\nmatter, if derived from granitic and similar crystalline rocks, is\r\ntermed _arkose_, or arkose sand, and consists of fragments of quartz,\r\nfeldspar, mica, etc. Common sand consists essentially of quartz grains.\r\nIf the fine fragments are derived from the darker igneous rocks, and\r\nconsist mainly of grains of plagioclase feldspar, and ferromagnesian\r\nminerals, it is sometimes called _wacke_. This term is not widely used\r\nin just this sense, but there seems to be an important place for it,\r\nand it will be so employed in this work. These disaggregated sands are\r\nbut special phases of the mantle-rock.\r\n\r\n=Disintegrated products.=—When the surface-rock is chemically\r\ndecomposed, the residual material is confined mainly to the insoluble\r\nportions, i.e., the silicious and clayey parts; while the lime,\r\nmagnesia, soda, potash, and similar substances are largely dissolved\r\nand borne to the ocean. The potash is somewhat more disposed to remain\r\nwith the clays than the soda, lime, or magnesia; but residues of all\r\nare usually present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Classes of Sedimentary Rocks._\r\n\r\n=Shales, sandstones, and conglomerates.=—As already shown in the\r\ndiscussion of the atmosphere and surface-waters, the mantle-rock is\r\nconstantly being borne away and redeposited in lodgment spots on the\r\nland or in the basins of the sea, while it is constantly being renewed\r\nbelow. It is an evanescent but ever-renewed derivative mantle. In this\r\nprocess of renewal, removal, and redeposition, the mantle material is\r\nusually assorted into mud, sand, and gravel; and these several classes\r\nof material are laid down more or less separately, and usually take\r\nthe stratified form, because their deposition depends on different\r\ndegrees of motion of the transporting waters or wind. When these\r\nseveral classes of material become cemented or otherwise hardened,\r\nthey give rise to _shales_ (cemented muds), _sandstones_ (cemented\r\nsands), and _conglomerates_ (or pudding-stones, cemented gravel, Fig.\r\n346). If the coarse material remains angular, they form _breccia_\r\ninstead of conglomerates (Figs. 347 and 348). For the most part, the\r\ndeposits of mud, sand, and gravel are made under the sea or in lakes\r\nand estuaries, but they are also formed on the land in lodgment basins,\r\nin low-gradient valleys, and on base-plains. The deposits of sediment\r\non land have received less recognition than they deserve. When formed\r\nunder the sea or in other life-sustaining waters, shells and other\r\norganic material are liable to be entrapped and to form a part of the\r\nrock. These organic remains, or fossils, greatly aid in interpreting\r\nthe deposits in which they occur. Fossils are less liable to be\r\npreserved in sedimentary deposits formed on land. There is, therefore,\r\nsome ground to suspect that great series of sandstones and shales which\r\ndo not contain marine or fresh-water fossils were formed in lodgment\r\nbasins on land, though the absence of fossils cannot be regarded as\r\nproof of such origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 351.—Globigerina ooze. Magnified 20 times.\r\n  (Murray and Renard.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 352.—Pteropod ooze. Magnified 4 times. (Murray\r\n  and Renard.)]\r\n\r\n=Limestones and dolomites.=—Of the lime, magnesia, soda, and potash\r\nleached out of the surface-rocks and carried to the ocean in solution,\r\nthe lime is largely extracted to form the shells, skeletons, teeth,\r\narmor, and other hard parts of sea-animals and sea-plants. These limy\r\nparts are at length left on the floor of the ocean and become more or\r\nless disintegrated and help to form beds of lime-mud and lime-sand\r\nwhich in time are cemented into _limestone_ (Figs. 349, 350, 351, and\r\n352). A larger proportion of the magnesia remains in solution in the\r\nsea-water, but in ways not yet well understood, the magnesia sometimes\r\nunites with the lime to form _dolomite_, a double carbonate of lime\r\nand magnesia (Ca,Mg)CO₃. This change is sometimes local, and sometimes\r\naffects great series of beds, more commonly the ancient ones than the\r\nmodern. Sometimes the dolomization appears to have taken place long\r\nafter the original limestone was formed and probably sometimes after\r\nit was lifted out of the sea, while in other cases it seems to have\r\ntaken place while the sediment was accumulating, or at least before the\r\nnext overlying beds were laid down. The potash in solution is to some\r\nlarge extent taken up by the land- and sea-plants or is retained in the\r\nclays, and through them becomes again incorporated in the sediments.\r\nThe soda largely remains in solution in the sea-water.\r\n\r\n=Precipitates.=—When a portion of the ocean-water is isolated in a\r\nregion where evaporation from the surface of the water is greater than\r\nthe rainfall on it, and the inflow from the tributary basin, the lime,\r\nmagnesia, soda, potash, and other dissolved substances (solutes) are\r\nconcentrated until the water becomes saturated. The solutes are then\r\nprecipitated in the order in which they reach the point of saturation.\r\nThis order, when taken in strict and full detail, gives a very complex\r\nseries, but the leading deposits are calcium carbonate (_limestone_),\r\ncalcium sulphate (_gypsum_), and sodium chloride (_halite_ or _rock\r\nsalt_) (see p. 375). Isolated lakes in arid regions may give rise\r\nto similar deposits. It has sometimes been thought that the ancient\r\nlimestones were produced largely by precipitation from concentrated\r\nsea-water. While this is probably the case in some instances and to\r\nsome degree, it has not been demonstrated that the great limestone\r\nformations were made to any large extent in this way. The more accepted\r\nview is that the limestones in the main were made from organic remains.\r\nThe lime in solution in the ocean is chiefly in the form of the\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 353.—Diatom ooze. Magnified 150 times. (Murray.)]\r\n\r\n=Iron Ore-beds.=—In a somewhat different way iron ore-deposits are\r\nformed by the precipitation of iron oxide or iron carbonate from\r\nsolutions of ferrous compounds. The ferrous compounds in solution\r\nwere leached from iron-bearing rocks by percolating waters. The most\r\nfamiliar case is that of iron-bearing springs. On exposure to the air,\r\nthe iron compounds in solution undergo change, and ferric oxide is\r\nthrown down, usually forming _limonite_ (Fe₂O₃,3H₂O), but sometimes\r\n_hematite_ (Fe₂O₃). This change is common in marshes and gives origin\r\nto “bog-ore.” Similar deposits take place in certain shallow lakes, and\r\nhence are known as “lake ore.” Iron ore sometimes also forms at the\r\nbottom of a peaty bed or in muddy soil. In connection with the great\r\ncoal formations, beds of iron carbonate (_siderite_) occur. Organic\r\nmatter seems to play a great part both in the original solution and\r\nthe later deposition of these ores. From certain soils and clay-beds\r\non which the ancient coal-producing forests grew, the iron has been\r\nalmost completely removed, either by the action of the roots, or\r\nmore probably by organic acids arising from their decay and from the\r\ndecaying vegetation on the surface. On flowing into shallow bodies\r\nof water or into marshes, the waters containing such dissolved iron\r\ncompounds usually throw down their iron content either as a carbonate\r\n(siderite), or as a hydrous ferric oxide (limonite). The siderite is\r\nformed where decaying vegetation is present to furnish abundant carbon\r\ndioxide and to partially protect the iron solution from oxidation, and\r\nthe limonite where free oxidation takes place. Sand, silt, clay, or\r\ncalcium carbonate often accumulates with the iron precipitate, and the\r\nresult is an impure deposit which becomes an _ironstone_. Such deposits\r\noften become segregated into nodules, as will be explained later. It\r\nis thought that diatoms sometimes aid in the deposit of iron ore in\r\nshallow waters.\r\n\r\n=Silicious deposits.=—In the decomposition of igneous rocks, a certain\r\nportion of the silica, as well as of the bases, is dissolved and\r\ncarried away in solution. Certain organisms extract this from solution\r\nfor their skeletons, just as others extract calcium carbonate. The\r\naccumulation of these silicious skeletons often forms silicious\r\nrocks. The _diatom_, _radiolarian_, and other oozes (Fig. 353) of\r\nthe deep sea are the great examples. Sometimes layers of infusorial\r\nearth, _tripolite_, arise from the shells of diatoms and other aquatic\r\norganisms secreting silica. The waters in which such earths accumulate\r\nare rather shallow, and either fresh or salt. The most familiar\r\nexamples of indurated rocks formed in this general method are the\r\n_flints_ and _cherts_ (impure flints) that occur in limestone and\r\nchalk, chiefly as nodules, but sometimes in distinct beds.\r\n\r\n=Organic rocks.=—While most limestones, chalks, flints, cherts, and\r\nthe silicious and calcareous oozes are formed through the agency of\r\norganisms, they are not themselves strictly organic. There is, however,\r\na small but important group of rocks formed directly from organic\r\nmatter. In favorable situations the woody parts of plants, falling\r\ninto water, are so far preserved from decay that they accumulate in\r\nbeds, and by slow changes pass into _peat_, _lignite_, _bituminous\r\ncoal_, _anthracite_, and _graphite_. The first of these is composed\r\nessentially of carbohydrates and hydrocarbons much as plants are, while\r\nthe last two are mainly carbon, and the intermediate members represent\r\nstages of passage from the first to the last. They are all derived from\r\nthe strictly organic part of the plants, and spring essentially from\r\nthe atmosphere and hydrosphere. They are only indirectly associated\r\nwith the evolutions of the inorganic series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTERNAL ALTERATIONS OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\nBesides the extreme alterations of rocks at the surface of the earth\r\nby which they pass into solution and into residual mantle-rock, and\r\nat length by transportation and re-sedimentation become stratified\r\nrocks, as just described, those rocks which are not at the surface are\r\nsubject to changes that give rise to several varieties of _altered\r\nrocks_. These changes are taking place constantly under ordinary\r\nconditions, though usually very slowly. Under great pressure and heat\r\nthe changes are relatively rapid and intense, and lead to results\r\nnot reached under other conditions. These more profound changes are\r\ntermed _metamorphism_, and will be considered later. It is, however,\r\nimportant to recognize the great fact that the outer part of the earth,\r\nfor perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 feet, is more or less fractured and\r\npermeated by water containing in solution various substances dissolved\r\nfrom the atmosphere, the soil, and the rocks through which it has\r\nalready passed, and that this permeating and circulating water is\r\nnow, and for long ages has been, working changes in the rocks, partly\r\nby dissolving matter out of them, partly by depositing matter in them,\r\nand partly by furnishing a medium through which new combinations of\r\ntheir constituents may take place. This outer fractured portion of the\r\nlithosphere has been called the _zone of fracture_.[201]\r\n\r\n=Oxidation and deoxidation.=—At and above the surface of the\r\nunderground water, where the rocks are easily reached by atmospheric\r\nwaters carrying much free oxygen, and by the air itself, _oxidation_\r\nprevails. Through oxidation the ferrous oxides are changed to ferric\r\noxides, a change which is usually manifested by a transition from a\r\ngray, green, or blue color, to buff, brown, yellow, or red. The partial\r\nprogress of such oxidation is often shown in a fractured block or\r\nbowlder whose exterior shows the latter colors, while the interior\r\nshows the former. The sulphides, of which common pyrites (FeS₂) is the\r\nmost familiar, are oxidized into sulphates, and then sometimes pass\r\non into the higher oxides and other compounds. Thus copperas (FeSO₄)\r\narises from pyrites (FeS₂) by direct oxidation of both Fe and S. The\r\nsulphuric acid of this compound, uniting with some base stronger than\r\nthe ferrous oxide, gives rise to further oxidation and results in\r\nhematite (Fe₂O₃) and limonite (Fe₂O₃,3H₂O). In general, the mineral\r\nconstituents of the rocks in this upper zone take on their maximum\r\nstates of oxidation. This oxidation affects more or less profoundly the\r\ncharacter of the rock as a whole. Deeper in the earth oxidation is less\r\nprevalent, and the action is sometimes reversed and deoxidation takes\r\nplace. So also wherever organic matter is undergoing decomposition\r\ndeoxidation is likely to occur.\r\n\r\n=Solution and deposition.=—Solution preponderates in the upper part\r\nof the zone of fracture, but deposition is prevalent in its deeper\r\nparts. The calcium carbonate and silica dissolved near the surface are\r\noften deposited below as calcite and quartz. The sulphates and other\r\nsulphur compounds that are formed and dissolved near the surface are\r\napt to be changed into sulphides lower down by deoxidation. The soluble\r\noxides and other compounds formed near the surface are often likewise\r\nprecipitated below. This is particularly true where the descending\r\nwaters encounter decomposing organic matter, and where they mingle\r\nwith waters that have followed other routes and have become charged\r\nwith different solutes. On coming together, reaction between the\r\nconstituents takes place, resulting sometimes in new solutions and\r\nsometimes in precipitation.\r\n\r\nIf these lower deposits of calcite, quartz, sulphides, etc., are made\r\nin the pores of the rock, they change its texture and composition. If\r\nthey are made in fissures they constitute _veins_, and if a sufficient\r\npercentage of the vein matter consists of valuable metallic compounds,\r\nthey constitute _ores_.\r\n\r\nAs the waters descend they suffer greater and greater pressure and some\r\nincrease of temperature, and these changes modify their power to hold\r\nsubstances in solution. In general, the waters increase in solvent\r\npower, but the effect is different for different mineral substances,\r\nand hence as a rule the waters are taking up some substances and\r\nlaying down others as they proceed. After penetrating to greater or\r\nless depths, the waters may come again to the surface, either because\r\nthey are pushed up by the higher head of the waters behind, or because\r\nthey become warmer and thus lighter, and are forced up by the heavier\r\ncold waters above, or else they pass up by diffusion through the\r\ndescending waters. In any case, the deep, warm waters, usually rather\r\nhighly charged with material dissolved in their previous courses, are\r\napt to deposit some of their burden as they ascend to horizons of\r\nlower pressures and temperatures. They are particularly liable to make\r\ndeposits where they commingle with other waters differently charged\r\nwith solutes. Thus internal changes in the body of the rocks are, and\r\nfor ages have been, taking place. In the upper part of the depositing\r\nzone, calcite is the dominant mineral deposited, while in the lower,\r\nquartz is more common; but much depends on local conditions and other\r\ninfluences, and no rigid rule holds good.\r\n\r\n=Hydration and dehydration.=—Water sometimes unites directly with some\r\nof the constituents of a rock and produces hydrated minerals, i.e.,\r\nminerals that have water as an element of their constitution, not\r\nsimply water absorbed into their pores. A large class of minerals known\r\nas zeolites, because they swell up and undergo life-like contortions\r\nwhen their basic water is driven off by heat, are examples of hydrous\r\nproducts. A more familiar example is limonite (Fe₂O₃,3H₂O), of which\r\nyellow ocher is a variety, which on heating sufficiently gives off its\r\nwater and becomes hematite (Fe₂O₃) or red ocher. The turning of yellow\r\nclay to red brick on burning is a familiar example of dehydration.\r\nThe general tendency in the upper zones penetrated by water is toward\r\nhydration. In the lower zones, where the pressure is great, Van Hise\r\nholds that there is a tendency toward dehydration, if the rocks have\r\nbeen previously hydrated. This may be the case if rocks have once\r\nbeen near the surface and later deeply buried by the accumulation of\r\nsediments on them. If the principle holds, rocks subjected to intense\r\nlateral pressure may be dehydrated.\r\n\r\n=Carbonation and decarbonation.=—The igneous rocks are largely\r\nsilicates. The carbonic acid of the surface-waters and of the air\r\nacting upon them, converts them, in part, into carbonates. In this\r\nway has arisen most of the original supply of calcium and magnesium\r\ncarbonates. Original carbonates formed in this way are precipitated and\r\nredissolved again and again. The carbonates in river-waters are much\r\nmore largely solutions of previously solid carbonates than original\r\ncarbonates formed from the silicates. The potassium and sodium of the\r\nsilicates also form carbonates, but by preference they unite with the\r\nsulphur and chlorine, and hence appear more largely as sulphates and\r\nchlorides.\r\n\r\nCarbonation is usually accompanied by oxidation and hydration. These\r\nseveral processes break up the complex and relatively unstable\r\nsilicates into simpler and more stable silicates, carbonates, and\r\noxides. This is illustrated by the following formulas illustrative\r\nof the changes undergone by augite and labradorite, two common\r\nrock-forming minerals.\r\n\r\nThe composition of augite may be represented by the formula\r\n\r\n  { CaO.(Mg,Fe)O.2SiO₂\r\n  { (Mg,Fe)O.(Al,Fe)₂O₃.SiO₂.\r\n\r\nAssuming Mg and Fe to be equal in amount in the first half of the above\r\nformula, and Mg and Fe to be equal in the first part of the second\r\nhalf, and Al and Fe to be equal in the last part of the second half,\r\ndoubling the whole and allowing it to be acted on by CO₂ and H₂O, we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n  2CaO.2MgO.2FeO.Al₂O₃.Fe₂O₃.6SiO₂ + 6CO₂ + 2H₂O\r\n          = 2CaCO₃ + 2MgCO₃ + 2H₂O.Al₂O₃.2SiO₂ + 2FeCO₃ + Fe₂O₃ + 4SiO₂.\r\n\r\nThe hydrous silicate of the last part of the equation is kaolin.\r\n\r\nThe composition of labradorite is represented by the formula\r\n\r\n  { CaO.Al₂O₃.2SiO₂\r\n  { Na₂O.Al₂O₃.6SiO₂.\r\n\r\nAssuming the two molecules represented by this formula to be equally\r\nabundant, and allowing the whole to be acted on by H₂O and CO₂, we have\r\n\r\n  CaO.Na₂O.2Al₂O₃.8SiO₂ + 4H₂O + 2CO₂\r\n                    = CaCO₃ + Na₂CO₃ + 2(2H₂O.Al₂O₃.2SiO₂) + 4SiO₂.\r\n\r\nWhen waters charged with carbonates descend into the earth they are\r\nlikely to precipitate a portion of their burden, forming calcite and\r\nother crystalline carbonates, and hence these are among the most\r\ncommon minerals found in veins and rock cavities. Carbonates are\r\nalso deposited when carbonate-charged waters come to the surface and\r\nevaporate or lose a part of their carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nDecarbonation also takes place, but it is, at least at the surface, a\r\nmuch less common process, and its conditions are less well understood.\r\nSufficiently high heat will drive off the carbon dioxide, as in the\r\nartificial process of burning lime, but this is rarely observed in\r\nnature. Even lava intrusions do not usually reduce limestone to\r\ncaustic lime at any appreciable distance from the contact. It is\r\nbelieved, however, that in the deeper zones, where high pressure and\r\nheat prevail, carbonates are changed into silicates, thus in a way\r\nreversing the process that prevails at the surface, and setting free\r\nagain a portion of the carbon dioxide that had become locked up in the\r\nformation of the carbonates. To this action some of the carbon dioxide\r\nof deep-seated thermal springs is assigned.\r\n\r\nThe carbonation of the silicates takes place at the expense of\r\nthe carbon dioxide of the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and hence\r\nin proportion as the igneous rocks are changed into carbonates,\r\nthe atmosphere and hydrosphere are depleted of carbon dioxide, new\r\nsupplies being neglected. As plants are dependent on carbon dioxide\r\nfor their principal food, and as animals are dependent on plants for\r\ntheir food, directly or indirectly, the process of carbonation has\r\na profound bearing on the life-history of the earth, and will often\r\ninvite attention in the historical chapters. It is sufficient here to\r\nnote that carbonation is one of the chief processes in the alteration\r\nof igneous rocks and furnishes, directly and indirectly, a larger\r\npercentage of the mineral substances dissolved in the waters that flow\r\nfrom the land, than any other single process.\r\n\r\n=Molecular rearrangements.=—Besides these and similar changes that\r\ninvolve additions and subtractions through the agency of percolating\r\nwater, the molecules of some of the rock constituents rearrange\r\nthemselves, or the elements enter into new chemical relations; thus,\r\npyroxene may pass into hornblende by a change of the crystalline\r\narrangement of the molecules. The change may sometimes be caught in\r\nprogress, the outer part of the crystal being hornblende (which when\r\nthus formed is called _uralite_), while the heart of the crystal\r\nremains pyroxene. So aragonite may pass into calcite.\r\n\r\nBy changes of the foregoing kinds, many crystalline rocks are much\r\naltered. Some become _chloritic_ from the development of the soft,\r\ngreen hydrated mineral, chlorite, derived from the pyroxene, amphibole,\r\nbiotite, and perhaps other silicates of the original rock. Others\r\nbecome _talcose_ from the development of talc, a very soft, unctuous,\r\nhydrous magnesian silicate developed from the magnesian minerals\r\nof the original rock. _Soapstone_ or _steatite_ is a rock composed\r\nessentially of such secondary material. _Serpentine_ is a rock made\r\nup of a similar secondary mineral (serpentine) apparently derived\r\nfrom chrysolite (olivine) and other magnesian minerals. _Epidote_, a\r\ncomplex lime-iron-alumina silicate, often recognizable by its peculiar\r\npistachio-green color, is derived from other silicates, and is rather\r\ncommon in many varieties of crystalline rocks. _Melaphyre_ is a name\r\napplied rather loosely and variously to certain altered basic rocks of\r\nthe basalt family. _Diabase_ is essentially an altered dolerite. Nearly\r\nall the very ancient basaltic rocks show notable degrees of alteration,\r\neven though they appear to have escaped unusual dynamic conditions\r\nsince their original formation, and hence their alteration seems to\r\nhave resulted chiefly from the operation of unobtrusive agencies, chief\r\namong which is the circulation of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Salient Features of Rock Descent._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing processes by which primitive or igneous rocks are\r\ndisintegrated and their constituents converted into fragmental material\r\nmay be said to constitute _the descent of rocks_ in its fuller\r\nsense. Viewed chemically, the great features of the process are (1)\r\nthe breaking down of the complex silicates, and (2) the gathering\r\nof the resultant simpler silicates (mainly aluminum silicates) into\r\nthe silt and clay beds, (3) the assembling of a large part of the\r\nfree acidic element (the quartz) into the sand and gravel beds, and\r\n(4) the concentration of a large part of the earthy basic element\r\n(the calcium, magnesium, and iron oxides) into the calcareous,\r\nmagnesian, and iron deposits, while (5) a large part of the alkaline\r\nbasic remainder (the sodium, and potassium oxides) is dissolved and\r\nheld in the sea-water. Physically, the great features are (1) the\r\ndisaggregation of the antecedent rock, and (2) the separation from\r\none another of products which are physically unlike, that is, the\r\ncoarser from the finer, and the heavier from the lighter, and (3) the\r\naggregation of these diverse materials in more or less distinct beds.\r\nIt is to be noted that while the rearrangement of the sediments is\r\nmade on the basis of their physical characters, it results in chemical\r\ndifferentiation as well, for the products of rock decay, which are\r\nphysically diverse, are often chemically diverse as well. The physical\r\nassortment and the stratification are to be looked upon as a step in\r\nthe direction of a simpler grouping of the material. On the whole, the\r\nprocess is descensional in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE REASCENSIONAL PROCESS.\r\n\r\nRunning hand in hand with this descensional process, there has\r\nalways been a reascensional process by which the coherence, the\r\ncrystallization, and in some measure the complex composition of the\r\nrocks are restored. This is partially due to external mechanical\r\nagencies, but chiefly to internal chemical and molecular forces.\r\n\r\nTwo general phases of this reconstructional work are recognized. The\r\nfirst, simplest and most universal, is that by which the incoherent\r\nmaterials produced by the descensional processes, i.e., the muds,\r\nsands, and clastic materials generally, are hardened into firm,\r\ncoherent shales, sandstones, and limestones, and incidentally more or\r\nless changed in composition and molecular arrangement. The second is\r\nthat by which more profound changes of induration and of composition\r\nare wrought, bringing the rock back to a state resembling its original\r\ncrystalline character. This is known as _metamorphism_. Often, however,\r\nit is but an extension and intensification of the more common processes\r\nof the first class. Metamorphism is essentially reconstruction.\r\n\r\n=Induration under ordinary pressures and temperatures.=—All kinds\r\nof loose fragmental material, whether soils, earths, clays, sands,\r\ngravels, volcanic ashes, cinders, or other forms of clastic or\r\npyroclastic material, may become hardened into firm rock either by\r\n_pressure_, or by _cementation_, or by both. Pressure and cementation\r\ncommonly act together and aid each other. The ordinary pressures\r\narise from the weight of the overlying material, and these of course\r\nincrease with depth. Extraordinary pressures arise from the shrinkage\r\nof the earth and perhaps from other sources. The fragments of the\r\nclastic material, on being pressed together for long periods, weld\r\nmore or less at the points of contact. If they are irregular, angular,\r\nor elongate, they come to interlock more or less like the fragments\r\nof macadam, and this coöperates with the welding. The process is\r\ngreatly aided by water-bearing solutions of lime, silica, etc. which\r\nare deposited at the points where the fragments press upon each other.\r\nIt is here that the capillary spaces are most minute and deposition\r\nis most liable to take place. Sometimes a film of mineral matter is\r\nlaid down over the surfaces of the fragments and serves to bind them\r\ntogether. This process goes on wherever the ground-waters are in a\r\ndepositing condition, just as the opposite process of disintegration\r\ntakes place wherever the waters are in a solvent state. At and near the\r\nsurface of the land, the waters are usually in the latter condition and\r\ndisintegration is in progress, as already noted, but this is not always\r\nso. At times and places, the water from within the rock-mass may come\r\nto the surface and evaporate, and in so doing leave all its dissolved\r\nmaterial on the surface, or within the outer pores of the mass, as\r\ncementing material. The exterior thus becomes firmly bound together,\r\n“case-hardened,” as it is termed. This may be seen in the drying of\r\na lump of mud, the exterior of which often becomes quite firm. It is\r\nseen in quarry-rock, especially sandstone, which is sometimes soft and\r\neasily worked when taken wet from the earth, but which hardens as the\r\nwater—the “sap” of the quarrymen—dries out and deposits its solutes in\r\nthe capillary spaces of the grains of the surface. It is obvious that\r\nit is the very last of the “sap” which contains the most concentrated\r\nsolutes, and that this last remnant is held in the minute capillary\r\nspaces where the grains touch each other, and hence the last stage of\r\ndrying leaves the cement at the points where it is most effective. In\r\nnatural exposures of sandstone, the pores of the outer shell sometimes\r\nbecome almost completely filled in this way with silicious deposits,\r\nand the sandstone is changed into a quartzite.\r\n\r\nIn the sea, and in the deep water underground, the common habit of\r\nthe water is to deposit more than to dissolve, though it is doing\r\nmore or less of both. As a rule, therefore, loose material in these\r\nsituations becomes bound more or less firmly into rock, and hence what\r\nwere originally loose sand beds become _sandstones_; what were soft\r\nmuds become _shales_ or _limestone_, according to composition; what was\r\ngravel becomes _conglomerate_; what was chipstone becomes _breccia_;\r\nwhat were volcanic ashes, cinders, and lapilli become _tuffs_; and\r\nwhat were masses of volcanic blocks and coarse fragments become\r\n_agglomerates_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  +Fig.+ 354.—Quartz crystal enlarged by secondary growth.

The shaded outlines\r\n  represent the surfaces of the sand grains before growth, the\r\n  intervening white portions, the added quartz, and the black portions,\r\n  unfilled spaces. Open spaces characterize sandstone. When the spaces\r\n  are filled with quartz, the rock becomes quartzite. Magnified 35\r\n  diameters. (Van Hise.)]\r\n\r\nThe cementing process works at times in specially interesting ways. In\r\nquartz sandstones, the grains are worn fragments of quartz crystals,\r\nformed originally in quartz-bearing rock. The crystalline force in\r\nthese remnants controls the arrangement of the new molecules of silica\r\ndeposited about them. The result is that the new deposits tend to\r\nbuild up the original forms of the crystals from which the sand grains\r\nwere derived (Fig. 354). Sometimes a film of iron oxide has formed\r\nabout the grain of sand before the addition of the new silica. This, or\r\nsome difference of color, may clearly distinguish the original grain\r\nfrom subsequent additions. Sometimes the adjacent grains of sandstone\r\nare rebuilt in this way until the interstices are completely filled.\r\nWhen this has been accomplished, the sandstone becomes a quartzite\r\n(Fig. 355). Most quartzites indeed appear to have been formed in this\r\nway, but mainly under special conditions that promote the deposition\r\nof silica. Grains of other minerals, such as feldspar, are subject to\r\nsimilar secondary enlargement (Fig. 356).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 356.—Feldspar crystals enlarged by secondary\r\n  growth. Magnified 50 diameters. _AA_ = original grains; _BB_ =\r\n  enlargements; _D_ = unfilled spaces. (Van Hise.)]\r\n\r\nSometimes the new material is deposited in the form of concentric\r\nshells about the particles of sediment, building them up into little\r\nspheres. Rock formed of such spherules is known as _oolite_, from the\r\nresemblance of the grains to the roe of fish (Fig. 357). Sometimes the\r\nnuclei of the concretions are grains of quartz sand, and the added\r\nconcentric layers are of calcium carbonate. In this case the structure\r\nis quite obvious; but perhaps more frequently the nuclei are minute\r\nand difficult to identify, and the concentric shells make up the main\r\nmass of the grains. Certain formations, as the oolitic limestone of\r\nIndiana and elsewhere, and the Upper and Lower Oolites of England,\r\nare characterized by this structure. In most cases these accretions\r\nprobably grew in depositing waters that gently rolled the grains while\r\nlayers were being added. They thus do not fall under the head of\r\ncementation after the beds were formed; but concentric additions to the\r\ngrains appear sometimes to have taken place after they were formed into\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n=Cavity filling.=—When cavities of some size occur in rocks and the\r\npercolating waters are in a depositing state, the interiors of the\r\ncavities are sometimes lined with concentric layers of deposit. Here,\r\ninstead of building _out_ from a nucleus, the waters build _in_ from\r\nthe walls of the cavity. The _agate structure_ (Fig. 358) is a case of\r\nthis kind, in which the successive layers are commonly silica in the\r\nform of chalcedony and differ from each other in color and texture.\r\nOften before the cavity is entirely filled, the deposit changes from\r\nchalcedony, to crystals of quartz, which grow with their bases on the\r\nwalls and their pyramidal points toward the center of the cavity.\r\n_Geodes_ are examples of a similar process in which the cavity is\r\nbut partially filled with crystals which have their bases set on the\r\nwalls of the cavity and their points directed inwards (Fig. 359). The\r\ncrystals of geodes are most commonly quartz or calcite, but they may\r\nbe any other mineral that the waters are capable of depositing. Very\r\nlarge cavities lined in this way are known to miners as _vuggs_, and\r\nthese grade on into caves lined with crystals and with _stalactite_\r\nand _stalagmite_. These are the largest expression of the solidifying\r\nprocess by means of internal deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 357.—Oolitic texture. About natural size. (Photo.\r\n  by Church.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 358.—Agate structure. The cavity was first coated\r\n  with mineral matter deposited from solution. The contracted cavity\r\n  was then nearly filled with the same sort of material deposited in\r\n  layers, apparently over the bottom, until the cavity was nearly\r\n  obliterated.]\r\n\r\n=Fissure-filling; veins.=—Cracks, crevices, and fissures filled by\r\ndeposition in a similar way give rise to _veins_ (Fig. 360). Here\r\nthe filling grows from the walls toward the center, and hence often\r\nhas a banded appearance. By this filling of cracks and crevices,\r\nthe circulating water heals the breaks in the rocks. Frequently a\r\ncrushed zone is thus restored to a solid state. When the fissures\r\nare deep and wide and traverse different formations, conditions are\r\nafforded for very complex deposits, and for the concentration of\r\nrare and valuable material originally dispersed through a great mass\r\nof rock. Ore deposition in such veins is usually treated as a theme\r\nby itself, but it is really but a declared expression of the work\r\nwhich the percolating waters are doing throughout all the rocks which\r\nthey penetrate. Most of the fine crystals that grace mineralogical\r\ncollections were formed in cavities and fissures by deposition from\r\ncirculating mineralized waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 359.—A geode. About half natural size. (Photo. by\r\n  Church.)]\r\n\r\n=Solution as well as deposition.=—A further phase of the process needs\r\nattention. The percolating waters are constantly taking up matter as\r\nwell as throwing it down, and so, while they are cementing fragments\r\ntogether and healing fractures, they are also removing material, and\r\na rock may be growing porous and cavernous at the same time that its\r\nfragments are being united. Cavities may be formed at one stage and\r\nfilled at another; matter may be taken up at one point and put down at\r\nanother, and so an internal reconstruction is in slow progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 360.—Veins of calcite in limestone. Calciferous\r\n  formation near Highgate Springs, Vt. (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Concretions.=—A notable phase of this internal reconstruction is the\r\nassembling together of like kinds of matter. For instance, silica that\r\nwas probably deposited in the form of the silicious shells and spicules\r\nof plants and animals, and was disseminated through the sediments as\r\noriginally formed, is aggregated into nodules of chert or flint (Fig.\r\n361); similarly, concretions of ferrous carbonate or calcium carbonate\r\ngrow in sands, silts, or muds; clusters of crystals of pyrite (FeS₂),\r\nof sphalerite (ZnS), and galenite (PbS) are formed in clayey layers,\r\npressing the clay back as they grow; and in many other cases, kind\r\ncomes to kind. Some concretions probably form during the accumulation\r\nof the beds in which they lie.\r\n\r\n=Replacements and pseudomorphs.=—So also there are replacements,\r\nsometimes resulting in imitative or false forms. Frequently the calcium\r\ncarbonate of corals, molluscan shells, etc., is replaced by silica, and\r\nthis substitution is brought about so gradually, particle by particle,\r\nthat the minutest details of structure are sometimes fully preserved.\r\nThis is often of great service in their study, since the limestone\r\nin which they are imbedded may often be dissolved away, while the\r\nsilicified fossil is unaffected. So woody matter is sometimes replaced\r\nby silica, forming silicified wood. Similarly, the molecules of one\r\ncrystal are sometimes replaced by different material, as the molecules\r\nof calcite by zinc carbonate, giving a pseudomorph of zinc carbonate\r\nafter calcite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 361.—Nodule of chert. About half natural size.\r\n(Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n=Incipient crystallization.=—A more general change is incipient\r\ncrystallization. Some common limestones and dolomites are now largely\r\nmade up of small crystals, though the mass was originally a calcareous\r\nmud or ooze. Incipient crystals are formed in shales and other\r\nsediments. This process, like the preceding, is a kind of incipient\r\nmetamorphism or reconstruction, but it is a pervasive process, taking\r\nplace under ordinary conditions of heat and pressure, and through the\r\nagency of circulating ground-waters.\r\n\r\nBy these and similar processes the fragmental deposits are solidified\r\ninto firm rock and undergo internal changes which more or less\r\nreorganize the matter of which they are composed. The process is a very\r\nslow one usually. Some of the sands and muds of very early geologic\r\nages are yet imperfectly solidified; e.g., much of the St. Peter’s\r\nsandstone, a very ancient formation, is yet so incoherent as to break\r\ndown into sand in being dug out, and is used for mortar sand much more\r\nthan for building stone. Some of the Hudson River shales of scarcely\r\nless age are more nearly clay than hard rock. But these are examples of\r\nexcessive slowness and slightness of change. In general, all but the\r\nmost recent deposits show notable progress in reconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 362.—Figure showing the elongation of pebbles\r\n  resulting from pressure. Carboniferous formation, Bancroft Place,\r\n  Newport, R. I. (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Reconstruction under Exceptional Conditions._\r\n\r\nTwo special conditions greatly influence changes in rocks, viz.,\r\npressure and heat. Their action gives rise to three general cases,\r\nbut these blend indefinitely: (1) exceptional pressure without great\r\nheat, (2) great heat without exceptional pressure, and (3) great heat\r\nand great pressure conjoined. Exceptional pressure may arise from the\r\nweight of overlying rocks, or from lateral thrust due to the shrinkage\r\nof the globe, and occasionally from other causes. Exceptional heat may\r\narise from pressure, from the intrusion of hot lavas, and occasionally\r\nfrom other sources. In the case of intruded lavas there may or may not\r\nbe exceptional pressure. Thrust usually gives heat as well as pressure,\r\nbut if lateral thrust acts on rocks near the surface, they may be\r\nmashed into new forms without becoming very exceptionally heated,\r\nthough some rise of temperature is inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 363.—Pre-Cambrian fossiliferous slate. Deep Creek\r\n  Canyon, 16 miles southeast of Townsend, Mont. (Walcott, U. S. Geol.\r\n  Surv].)\r\n\r\n(1) =Slaty structure.=—When rocks made up of clastic particles are\r\ncompressed in a given direction and are relatively free to expand at\r\nright angles to the direction of pressure, the particles that are\r\nalready elongated tend to take positions with their longer axes at\r\nright angles to the direction of pressure, and all particles, whether\r\nelongate or not, are more or less flattened in a plane transverse\r\nto the direction of pressure. This may be readily seen where the\r\nparticles are large (Fig. 362). As a result of the orientation and\r\nflattening of their particles, rocks so affected split more readily\r\nbetween the elongate and flattened particles than across them. In\r\nother words, the rocks cleave along planes normal to the direction of\r\ncompression, and break with difficulty and with rough fracture across\r\nthe planes of cleavage. The condition thus induced is known as slaty\r\nstructure (Fig. 363), and is best illustrated by roofing-slate, which\r\nwas originally a mud, later a shale, and finally assumed the slaty\r\ncondition under strong compression. Sometimes the original bedding\r\nmay still be seen running across the induced cleavage planes (Fig.\r\n364). As the original mud beds were horizontal or nearly so, and as\r\nthe thrust is usually horizontal or nearly so, the induced cleavage\r\ncommonly crosses the bedding planes at a high angle (Fig. 364); but\r\nafter the beds are tilted or bent, the lines of pressure take new\r\ndirections relative to the bedding planes, and the angles between the\r\noriginal bedding and the slaty cleavages usually become smaller, and\r\nmay even disappear in exceptional cases. Limestones, sandstones, and\r\nconglomerates are not so easily compressed as mudstones, and they\r\nusually take on only an imperfect cleavage normal to the direction of\r\npressure. Often they merely show some little compacting, while the\r\nshaly strata between them are converted into slate. Obviously the\r\ndirection of slaty cleavage may be used to determine the direction of\r\nthe compressing force, and is thus serviceable in dynamic studies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 364.—Slaty structure and its relation to bedding\r\n  planes. Two miles south of Walland, Tenn. (Keith, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 365.—Foliated rock. (Ells, Can. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Foliation, schistosity.=—A more intense application of pressure in\r\na given direction is capable of breaking down and deforming the most\r\nresistant rock. This must necessarily be attended with the evolution\r\nof much heat, and thermal effects are mingled with pressure effects,\r\nbut the thermal effects may be neglected for the moment. The first\r\nstage of the mechanical effect of the compression may be to crush the\r\nrock more or less. It thus becomes granular or fragmental, and is\r\nreally a peculiar species of clastic rock (_autoclastic_). At a further\r\nstage, the fragmented material may be pressed into layers or leaves,\r\nmuch as in the development of slaty cleavage, but as a result of the\r\nnature of the material, the cleavage is less perfect. This is often\r\nattended by more or less shearing of the material upon itself, and thus\r\na rude fissility and foliation is developed. The result, including the\r\nattendant metamorphism about to be described, is a _foliated_ or\r\n_schistose structure_ (Figs. 365 and 366). Even the most massive rocks\r\nmay be reduced to the foliated form by this process; thus, a granite\r\nmay be mashed into a _gneiss_—which is a granite in composition, but\r\nhas a foliated structure—or a basalt may be converted into a _schist_,\r\na common term for foliated crystalline rocks. Porphyritic rock rendered\r\nschistose by pressure is shown in Fig. 366. When massive rocks like\r\ngranite or basalt are thus crushed down into the foliated form, the\r\nprocess is in a sense degradational. It is a kind of _katamorphism_\r\nor downward change. It is often difficult to differentiate the\r\nschists thus derived by degrading massive rocks, from those developed\r\nby ascensional processes from clastic formations (_anamorphism_).\r\nThe action of heat is important in the evolution of schists of both\r\nclasses, but the effects of heat may best be taken up where it acts\r\nmeasurably alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 366.—Porphyry rendered schistose by pressure.\r\n  Near Green Park, Caldwell Co., N. C. (Keith, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 367.—Schistose structure developed by pressure\r\n  shown in the left half of the figure, while it is wanting in the\r\n  right half. The vertical line is a bedding plane. The layer to\r\n  the left was of sufficiently different composition or subject to\r\n  sufficiently different movement to develop schistosity, while that\r\n  to the right was broken (brecciated) instead. The rock at the left\r\n  would be called quartz schist, while that at the right is quartzite.\r\n  Huronian formation near Ableman, Wis. (Atwood.)]\r\n\r\n=Metamorphism by heat.=—When a mass of lava is poured out upon the\r\nsurface, it bakes the mantle-rock which it overruns, in greater or less\r\ndegree, depending on the mass and temperature. The nature of the effect\r\nis much the same as in the process of brick-making, a dehydration of\r\nthe material, a hardening of the loose matter by the partial welding of\r\nthe particles, and sometimes the partial fusion of the surface and the\r\ndevelopment of new compounds, usually glassy, but sometimes partially\r\ncrystalline. In both the natural and the artificial process, the time\r\nelement is short, the pressure trivial, and the water action limited.\r\nIf the heat were to become sufficiently intense, the result would be\r\nfusion, i.e., a lava which would solidify into a glass. In such a case,\r\nthe rock cycle would be carried back to the initial molten state and a\r\nnew cycle instituted, but this does not usually take place when lava\r\nmerely overflows the surface.\r\n\r\nIf lavas, instead of rising to the surface, wedge in between layers of\r\nrock and form _sills_, or interstratified sheets, the surface above\r\nas well as that below is baked, and as the excess of heat of the\r\nlava can only escape through the neighboring rock, the effects for\r\na given mass of lava are more considerable, and as the time element\r\nand the water action (and sometimes the pressure) are usually greater\r\nthan in the case of extruded lavas, the effects tend rather toward\r\nchemical and crystalline change than to simple baking. This tendency\r\nincreases with increase in the mass of the lava and in its temperature.\r\nSometimes enormous masses of very hot lava are thrust in between or\r\namong the strata that lie beneath the surface, and bring to bear upon\r\nthem intense heat for a long period. So also, when a vent or fissure\r\nis the passageway for lavas that continue to come to the surface for\r\nlong periods, as in the case of persistent volcanoes, the rocks which\r\nform the walls of the vent or fissure are heated for a long time, and\r\nthis gives rise to metamorphism through heat, without very unusual\r\npressure, but usually with the free aid of water. In these cases the\r\nchief effect is chemical recombination and crystallization. In the\r\nlimestones and sandstones it is simple; in the shales more complex. In\r\npure limestones and dolomites little chemical change takes place, but\r\nthe molecules are rearranged into larger and more perfect crystals, and\r\n_marble_ is the result. The coarseness of the crystals is, in a general\r\nway, a measure of the length of time during which the heat acts, and\r\nof its intensity, but much depends on the freedom of the attendant\r\nwater circulation. Crystals an inch or two across are sometimes formed\r\nin the contact zone, where the attendant water action is important.\r\nIf impurities, as silica, alumina, iron, etc., are present, various\r\nminerals, such as _tremolite_ and _actinolite_, may be formed in the\r\nmarble. In pure quartzose sandstones, the effect is to cause the\r\nbuilding up of the quartz grains until the interspaces are essentially\r\nfilled and the whole becomes a massive _quartzite_. Here, as in the\r\nmarbles, impurities form adventitious crystals, a very common one being\r\n_hematite_, formed from the segregation of the ferric oxide of the\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the shales, the material to be acted upon is more complex, for,\r\nwhile the main mass is an aluminum silicate, there is usually much\r\nfree quartz, not a little potash and iron, and more or less of lime,\r\nmagnesia, soda, and other ingredients, for the muds from which the\r\nshales arose contained not only the fully decomposed matter of the\r\noriginal crystalline rocks, but the fine matter worn from them by\r\nwind and water without decomposition. When this mixed matter is acted\r\nupon by high heat and moisture, it tends to return to its original\r\ncrystalline state, so far as its changed constitution permits. The\r\npotash chiefly unites with alumina and silica, and forms potash\r\nfeldspar (orthoclase chiefly) and potash mica (muscovite). The iron\r\noften unites with magnesia, alumina, and silica to form biotite or one\r\nof the ferromagnesian minerals, chiefly an amphibole. The lime usually\r\naids in the formation of other silicates of either the feldspar or\r\nthe ferromagnesian group, while the surplus silica crystallizes into\r\nquartz. There is usually a predisposition to form mica in preference\r\nto other silicates if the proper constituents are present, and the\r\nresult is that _mica schists_ and _gneisses_, in which mica abounds,\r\nare common products of the metamorphism of shales by contact with\r\nbodies of lava. Mica schists and micaceous gneisses are also formed\r\nin other ways, and other schists, dependent on the composition of\r\nthe shales, are formed about intrusions of igneous rock. In all such\r\ncases pressure probably attends the heat and is a factor in the\r\ndevelopment of the schists. When the change induced by the heat is less\r\nconsiderable, the shale is baked, with incipient recrystallization, and\r\noften takes the form of _argillite_, a compact, massive sort of shale.\r\n\r\nBeds of hydrous iron oxide (limonite) or of iron carbonate (siderite)\r\nare usually converted by heat into hematite or magnetite. Beds of peat,\r\nlignite, and bituminous coal are converted into anthracite by the\r\ndriving off of the volatile hydrocarbons. If the process goes to the\r\nextreme, graphite is the result.\r\n\r\n=Metamorphism by heat and lateral pressure.=—As already indicated,\r\nthe more common intense pressures experienced by rocks at and near\r\nthe surface are those that come from lateral thrusts arising from the\r\nshrinkage of the earth. These affect one dimension of the rock-mass,\r\nwhile they permit it to expand in one or both of the other dimensions.\r\nThis produces a strain in all the constituent particles of the rock,\r\nand under such strain they pass more readily into solution than when\r\nfree from strain, and more readily rearrange their molecules internally\r\ninto positions of less strain. The crystals grow most freely along the\r\nplanes of least stress, i.e., at right angles to the pressure.[202] As\r\na consequence, where unidimensional pressure and high heat resulting\r\nfrom the compression unite their influence, the metamorphic changes\r\nare not only facilitated, but the rearrangement is controlled by the\r\npressure and results in a parallel arrangement of the constituent\r\ncrystals, giving a foliated or schistose character to the new rock.\r\nThe changes themselves are much the same as those produced by heat\r\nand water without exceptional pressure, though some distinctions may\r\nbe noted. It is to be observed, however, that two kinds of work are\r\nembraced here: the metamorphism of clastic rocks into crystalline\r\nschists, which may be regarded as an upbuilding process, anamorphism,\r\nand the mashing down of massive crystalline rocks into schists, which\r\nmay be regarded as a degradational process, katamorphism. In both\r\ncases, however, there is solution and rearrangement of the molecules.\r\nThe katamorphism of basalts and other basic rocks gives basic schists;\r\nthat of granitic and similar rocks gives gneisses. The anamorphism of\r\nbasic pyroclastic tuffs and wackes gives basic schists, while that\r\nof acid pyroclastics and most shales gives gneisses, mica schists,\r\nor similar acidic schists. It is obvious that ordinary shales cannot\r\nusually become basic schists, because in producing the original\r\nmuds, the bases were generally removed; but when shales are highly\r\ncalcareous and magnesian, as when they grade toward the limestones and\r\ndolomites, they may become basic schists by metamorphism, e.g., certain\r\nhornblendic schists. It is even more obvious that the limestone and\r\nsandstone formations must largely retain their distinct composition. It\r\nis thus seen that, in general, a sedimentary series anamorphosed must\r\ndiffer from a crystalline series katamorphosed, though both give rise\r\nto foliated or schistose rocks.\r\n\r\n=Deep-seated metamorphism.=—When the exceptional pressure arises from\r\nthe weight of rocks felt at great depth, it is practically equal in\r\nall directions and the crystallization probably develops normally and\r\nis not forced into the parallel or foliated form. Rocks metamorphosed\r\nunder these conditions probably tend to take the massive form rather\r\nthan the schistose form, but this conclusion is theoretical rather than\r\nobservational, for little or nothing is known of the history of such\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n=Completion of the rock cycle.=—The crystallizing processes of\r\nmetamorphism are fundamentally similar to the processes by which rocks\r\ncrystallize out of magmas, only in the first case the work is done\r\nchiefly by the aid of an aqueous solution, while in the second it is\r\ndone through a mutual solution of the constituents in themselves,\r\nwhere water was but an incident. If the heat factor in metamorphism\r\nbe sufficiently increased, aqueous solution may actually grade into\r\nmagmatic solution through various degrees of softening and melting, and\r\nthe cycle of changes be closed in upon itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n              VARIOUS CLASSIFICATIONS AND NOMENCLATURES.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing sketch of the processes of rock-making it may easily\r\nbe inferred that the varieties of rocks may be almost unlimited, and\r\nthat they may be defined, named, and classified on many different\r\nbases; for example.\r\n\r\n(1) If _the mode of origin_ is chiefly in mind, rocks may be classed\r\nas _igneous_ (lavas, tuffs, etc.); _metamorphic_ (schists, gneisses,\r\nanthracite, magnetite, etc.); _aqueous_ (water-laid sediments,\r\nstalactites, travertine, etc.); _eolian_ (dunes, loess in part);\r\n_glacial_ (till, moraines); _clastic_ (mantle-rock, sandstone,\r\nconglomerate, etc.); _organic_ (peat, lignite, coal, etc., and\r\nindirectly, limestone, chalk, infusorial earth, etc.); and so on.\r\n\r\n(2) If the _textural or structural characters_ are in mind, rocks are\r\ndesignated vesicular (pumice, scoria, etc.); rhyolitic (flow-structure\r\nrocks); glassy (obsidian, tachylite); porphyritic (distinct crystals\r\nin obscure matrix); granitic (well-grained); compact, porous, earthy,\r\narenaceous (sandy), schistose, etc.\r\n\r\n(3) If the _chemical composition_ is chiefly regarded, they may be\r\nclassed as silicious, calcareous, carbonaceous, ferruginous, etc.; or,\r\nif the _chemical nature_ is considered, they are grouped as acidic,\r\nbasic, or neutral.\r\n\r\n(4) If the _crystalline character_ is made the basis, they\r\nare designated phanerocrystalline (distinctly crystallized),\r\nmicrocrystalline (minutely crystallized), cryptocrystalline (hiddenly\r\ncrystallized), and amorphous (non-crystalline).\r\n\r\n(5) If attention is fastened on _certain ingredients_, rocks\r\nare characterized as quartzose, micaceous, chloritic, talcose,\r\npyritiferous, garnetiferous, etc.\r\n\r\n(6) When rocks are regarded as _mineral aggregates_, if (_a_) the\r\n_aggregates are simple_, they are named from the dominant minerals,\r\nas dolomite, hornblendite, garnetite, anorthite, etc.; and if (_b_)\r\nthe _aggregates are complex_ they take special names, as syenite\r\n(orthoclase and hornblende), gabbro (plagioclase feldspar and\r\npyroxene), etc.\r\n\r\n(7) When the point of view is _structure of the mass_, they are classed\r\nas massive, stratified, shaly, laminated, slaty, foliated, schistose,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n(8) When _physical state_ or _genesis_ is considered, they are grouped\r\nas clastic, fragmental, or detrital (conglomeratic, brecciated,\r\narenaceous, argillaceous, etc.); or pyroclastic (tufaceous,\r\nscoriaceous, agglomeratic); or massive, in a sense slightly different\r\nfrom that above (7).\r\n\r\nAs sometimes one of these characteristics and sometimes another is most\r\nimportant in a given rock, or in a given study, no one classification\r\nis satisfactory in all cases, yet each has its advantages in particular\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _New System of Classification and Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nThe present systems of classifying and naming rocks have grown up\r\ngradually out of earlier and cruder methods, many of which were\r\ninherited from popular usage. Most of the names and definitions came\r\ninto use before microscopical and other modern means of study were\r\nadopted. These systems, therefore, retain many inherited crudities\r\nand inconsistencies, and lack adaptation to present needs. They are\r\ntoo complex and difficult for field use and for general discussions,\r\nwhile not sufficiently exact and systematic for the more rigorous\r\npetrological discussions. A more adaptive and consistent practice\r\nhas been earnestly sought by petrologists, and a new system of\r\nclassification of igneous rocks has been offered by a group of leading\r\nAmerican petrologists, an outline of which is here given.[203] To\r\nsome extent this may be extended to the metamorphic crystalline\r\nrocks with necessary modifications and additions. The classification\r\nand nomenclature of the secondary rocks must probably always remain\r\nvariable and plastic to express the various points of view which it\r\nis desirable to take. During the transition to this or some other new\r\nsystem, which seems inevitable, the appended alphabetical reference\r\nlists of the most common minerals and rocks, with brief definitions in\r\naccordance with current usage, will be found serviceable. The proposed\r\nsystem includes two parts, a _field system_ and a _quantitative\r\nsystem_, the one applicable to rocks on casual inspection, and the\r\nother, only after detailed study.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The proposed field system._\r\n\r\nThe proposed field names are based largely on _texture_ and _color_.\r\nThe mineral constituents are used for subdivisions when they can be\r\ndetermined; otherwise they are neglected.\r\n\r\nClassifying chiefly on the basis of texture and crystalline state,\r\nthere are three groups: _Phanerites_, in which all the leading mineral\r\nconstituents can be seen megascopically; _aphanites_, in which all, or\r\nat least an appreciable part, of the constituent minerals cannot be\r\ndistinguished megascopically; and _glasses_, in which the material is\r\nwholly or largely vitreous.\r\n\r\nI. The =Phanerites= may be further classified by their chief mineral\r\nconstituents as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Granites_ (f.n.),[204] consisting largely of _quartz_ and\r\n_feldspar_ of any kind, with or without mica, hornblende, pyroxene,\r\nor other minerals. This differs from the present common use in not\r\nregarding mica as an essential constituent, and in not distinguishing\r\nbetween alkali feldspars and calcic feldspars, thus broadening the\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n2. _Syenites_ (f.n.), consisting predominantly of _feldspar_ of any\r\nkind, with subordinate amounts of hornblende, mica, or pyroxene, but\r\nwith little or no quartz. This differs from the common use in giving\r\nhornblende a subordinate place, and in embracing rocks with calcic\r\nfeldspars, thus broadening the class.\r\n\r\n3. _Diorites_ (f.n.), consisting predominantly of _hornblende_ and\r\nsubordinately of _feldspar_ of any kind, with which there may be mica,\r\npyroxene, or other minerals. This is nearly the present use except that\r\nany kind of feldspar may form the subordinate element.\r\n\r\n4. _Gabbros_ (f.n.), consisting predominantly of _pyroxene_ and\r\nsubordinately of _feldspar_ of any kind, with or without other\r\nminerals. This nearly coincides with one of the various present uses of\r\nthe term except that the range of the feldspar is increased.\r\n\r\n5. _Dolerites_[205] (f.n.), consisting predominantly of _any\r\nferromagnesian mineral_ not distinguishable as hornblende or pyroxene,\r\nwith subordinate elements of _feldspar_ of any kind, and with or\r\nwithout other accessory minerals. A name to be used when the dominant\r\nmineral is clearly ferromagnesian, but cannot be satisfactorily\r\nidentified as either hornblende or pyroxene, although it may probably\r\nbe one of these. In other words, the dolerites (deceptive) embrace the\r\nwhole diorite-gabbro group when too obscure for separation.\r\n\r\n6. _Peridotites_, consisting predominantly of _olivine_ and\r\n_ferromagnesian minerals_, _without_ feldspar, or with very little.\r\n\r\n7. _Pyroxenite_, consisting essentially of pyroxene without feldspar or\r\nolivine.\r\n\r\n8. _Hornblendite_, consisting essentially of hornblende without\r\nfeldspar or olivine.\r\n\r\nII. The =Aphanites= may be _non-porphyritic_ or _porphyritic_.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Non-porphyritic aphanites when light-colored may be classed as\r\n_felsites_; when dark-colored, as _basalts_.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The porphyritic aphanites or _porphyries_, when light-colored,\r\nare _leucophyres_; when dark-colored, are _melaphyres_ (f.n.). They may\r\nbe classified further, according to the kind of phenocryst imbedded in\r\nthe aphanitic ground-mass, as\r\n\r\n  _Quartz-porphyries_, or quartzophyres;\r\n  _Feldspar-porphyries_, or feldspaphyres (not felsophyres);\r\n  _Hornblende-porphyries_, or hornblendophyres; and so on.\r\n  These may be subclassed by color, as\r\n  _Quartz-leucophyres_, light-colored quartz-porphyries;\r\n  _Quartz-melaphyres_, dark-colored quartz-porphyries;\r\n  _Feldspar-leucophyres_;\r\n  _Feldspar-melaphyres_; and so on.\r\n\r\nIII. The glasses are classified, according to color and luster, into\r\n_obsidians_ or _pitchstones_ when dark and lustrous; _perlites_, when a\r\nspheroidal fracture gives them a pearly appearance; and _pumice_ when\r\ngreatly inflated by included gases.\r\n\r\nIn general discussions, it is regarded as serviceable to use the term\r\n_granitoids_ in a broad generic sense, to include all crystalline\r\nrocks of the general granitoid type, including the granites, syenites,\r\ngneisses, etc. In a similar broad way, the term _gabbroids_ may be\r\nused to include the dark crystalline rocks in which the ferromagnesian\r\nminerals predominate, as the diorites, gabbros, dolerites, peridotites,\r\netc. In this convenient and comprehensive way, two contrasted groups of\r\nigneous rocks may be designated. As the granitoids are usually acidic\r\nand the gabbroids usually basic, the grouping represents a broad fact\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the more rigorous system designed\r\nto meet the needs of scientific petrology is its quantitative chemical\r\ncharacter. All igneous rocks are classified _primarily_ according to\r\ntheir chemical composition and only secondarily according to their\r\nmineral constituents, texture, and other characters. The rigorous\r\napplication of the system requires chemical analyses of the rocks, but\r\nas these are not available in many cases, the authors of the system\r\nhave devised a method of optical mineral analysis by which the nearly\r\nexact proportions of all the constituent minerals can be determined,\r\nand by knowledge of their chemical nature the results may be converted,\r\nby computation, into chemical terms. This can only be done for\r\nholocrystalline rocks whose crystals are large enough to be measured\r\nunder the microscope, but aphanitic rocks may often be approximately\r\nclassified by comparison with similar rocks already accurately\r\ndetermined. To facilitate this method of chemical analysis by measuring\r\nthe minerals, the chemical composition of certain common rock-making\r\nminerals is expressed in proportional parts and tabulated, and is used\r\nsomewhat as molecular weight is in ordinary chemical analysis. Certain\r\nof these are selected as _standard_ minerals, the selection being such\r\nthat the standard minerals embrace all the essential elements that\r\nenter into the composition of rocks. All other minerals are converted\r\ninto their chemical equivalents in terms of these standard minerals by\r\nthe use of the tables. All the mineral constituents being thus reduced\r\nto standard minerals, the classification is built up systematically on\r\nthese standard (or standardized) minerals.\r\n\r\nA new system of names is required, and these have been very skillfully\r\nformed by selecting significant letters from the names of the leading\r\nminerals or from words signifying their preponderance, so that short\r\nterms which carry their meaning in their forms, are secured, and\r\nthis has been done so that these are usually euphonious, however\r\nstrange they may seem to our preoccupied senses. For example, minerals\r\ncomposed chiefly of _s_ilica and _al_umina are called _salic_;\r\nthose of _fe_rro_m_agnesian minerals, _femic_; those of _al_uminous\r\n_fe_rromagnesian minerals, _alferric_, etc. When in a combination of\r\nsalic and femic minerals, the salic are extremely abundant, the rock is\r\n_per_salic; if notably _do_minant, _do_salic; if the salic and femic\r\nminerals are nearly equal, _salfemic_; if the femic are _do_minant,\r\n_dofemic_; if extremely abundant, _per_femic, and so on, the system\r\nbeing mnemonic. This method of deriving names is applicable only to a\r\nportion of the necessary divisions. For the rest, a series of roots\r\nderived from geographic names, with a system of terminations, has been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nAll standard minerals are divided into two groups of primary\r\nimportance: one of minerals characterized by alumina, as the\r\nfeldspars,—orthoclase, albite, anorthite,—leucite, nephelite, sodalite,\r\nnoselite, and corundum, to which are added the closely associated\r\nminerals, quartz and zircon. This is called the _salic_ group. The\r\nsecond group contains minerals characterized by iron and magnesia with\r\nno alumina, as hypersthene (enstatite), acmite, olivine, magnetite,\r\nhematite, and ilmenite, to which are added the closely associated\r\nminerals, titanite, perofskite, rutile, apatite, and all other\r\nrock-making minerals except those containing alumina together with\r\niron and magnesia. The second group is called _femic_.\r\n\r\nAluminous ferromagnesian minerals, such as hornblende, augite, mica,\r\netc.; are called _alferric_, and are not classed as standard minerals,\r\nbecause their complexity of composition makes it better to treat them\r\nas though made up of the simpler minerals of the standard list.\r\n\r\nThe composition of all igneous rocks can be expressed in terms of the\r\nrelative proportions of the two groups of the standard minerals, salic\r\nand femic. By subdividing these groups successively on a mineral and\r\nchemical basis, a series of classificatory divisions of greater and\r\ngreater precision has been formed. In each stage of the series, two\r\nfactors only are compared, and a simple set of ratios has been selected\r\nto limit the divisions. Assuming the possibility of a continuous range\r\nof variable mixtures of the two factors (_A_ and _B_) from an extreme\r\ncomposed wholly of one (_A_), and an extreme composed wholly of the\r\nother (_B_), five ideal cases have been chosen as types or centerpoints\r\nabout which variation in mixture may take place. These are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A_ = 1   _A_ = 3   _A_ = 1   _A_ = 1   _A_ = 0\r\n  ———   —,  ———   —,  ———   —,  ———   —,  ———   —.\r\n  _B_ = 0   _B_ = 1   _B_ = 1   _B_ = 3   _B_ = 1\r\n\r\nDivision lines half-way between these points occur as the following\r\nratios:\r\n\r\n    _A_   7      _A_   7 > 5      _A_   5   3      _A_   3   1      _A_   1\r\n(1) ——— > —, (2) ——— < — > —, (3) ——— < — > —, (4) ——— < — > —, (5) ——— < —.\r\n    _B_ > 1      _B_ < 1 > 3      _B_   3   5      _B_   5   7      _B_   7\r\n\r\nThese ratios are used throughout the system. In (1) _A_ is _extreme_;\r\nin (5) _B_ is _extreme_; in (2) _A_ _dominates_ over _B_; in (4) _B_\r\n_dominates_ over _A_; in (3) _A_ and _B_ are _equal_ or _nearly equal_.\r\n\r\nAll igneous rocks are grouped in five (5) primary divisions called\r\n_Classes_ on a basis of the proportions of the salic and femic\r\nminerals, thus:\r\n\r\nClass  I. Sal   7\r\n          ——— > —, extremely rich in salic minerals, called _persalane_.\r\n          Fem   7\r\n\r\n      II. Sal   7   5\r\n          ——— < — > —, with dominant salic minerals, called _dosalane_.\r\n          Fem   1   3\r\n\r\n     III. Sal   5 > 3\r\n          ——— < — > —, salic and femic minerals, equal or nearly equal,\r\n          Fem   3   5\r\n            called _salfemane_.\r\n\r\n      IV. Sal   3   1\r\n          ——— < — > —, with dominant femic minerals, called _dofemane_.\r\n          Fem   5   7\r\n\r\n       V. Sal   1\r\n          ——— < —, extremely rich in femic minerals, called _perfemane_.\r\n          Fem   7\r\n\r\nEach of these classes is divided into two _subclasses_ according to\r\nthe proportions of two subgroups of the preponderant group of standard\r\nminerals. Of salic minerals one subgroup includes quartz, feldspars,\r\nand the feldspathoids; the other includes corundum and zircon. Of femic\r\nminerals one subgroup includes the silicates with magnetite, ilmenite,\r\nhematite, and rutile; the other contains apatite and the remaining\r\nminerals of this group. Most known igneous rocks fall into the first\r\nsubclass of each class.\r\n\r\nThe classes are further divided into _orders_ according to the\r\nproportions of certain minerals in the preponderant subgroups. Thus\r\nClasses I, II, and III are each divided into nine orders on a basis of\r\nthe proportions of quartz and the feldspars, and of the feldspars and\r\nthe feldspathoids, quartz and feldspathoids not occurring together. The\r\norders may be described in the same terms for each of the first three\r\nclasses as follows:\r\n\r\nOrder I. Q   7\r\n         — > —, extremely rich in quartz, _perquaric_.\r\n         F   1\r\n\r\n     II. Q   7   5\r\n         — < — > —, quartz dominant over feldspar, _doquaric_.\r\n         F   1   3\r\n\r\n    III. Q   5   3\r\n         — < — > —, quartz and feldspar equal or nearly equal, _quarfelic_.\r\n         F   3   5\r\n\r\n     IV. Q   3   1\r\n         — < — > —, feldspar dominant over quartz, _quardofelic_.\r\n         F   5   7\r\n\r\n      V. Q or L   1\r\n         —————— < —, extremely rich in feldspar, _perfelic_.\r\n           F      7\r\n\r\n     VI.

L   5   3\r\n         — < — > —, feldspar and lenads equal or nearly equal, _lenfelic_.\r\n         F   3   5\r\n\r\n   VIII. L   7   5\r\n         — < — > —, lenads dominant over feldspars, _dolenic_.\r\n         F   1   3\r\n\r\n     IX. L   7\r\n         — > —, extremely rich in lenads, _perlenic_.\r\n         F   1\r\n\r\nIn classes IV and V the preponderant minerals are femic, and in\r\nsubclass 1 they are silicates, titanates, and ferrates, with hematite\r\nand rutile. These are subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\nSilicates—pyroxenes and olivine with akermanite in one subgroup; the\r\nother minerals, magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, titanite, perofskite,\r\nrutile, in the second subgroup. This first group is called _polic_,\r\nmnemonic of pyroxene and olivine; the second group is called _mitic_,\r\nmnemonic of magnetite, ilmenite, titanite.\r\n\r\nThere are five orders in each of these classes, as follows:\r\n\r\nOrder I. PO   7\r\n         —— > —, extremely rich in pyroxene or olivine, _perpolic_.\r\n         M    1\r\n\r\n     II.

PO   1\r\n         —— < —, extremely rich in mitic minerals, _permitic_.\r\n         M    7\r\n\r\nIn the first three orders a distinction between pyroxene and olivine is\r\nrecognized by sections, five in number:\r\n\r\nSection 1. P   7\r\n           — > —, extremely rich in pyroxene, _perpyric_.\r\n           O   1\r\n\r\n        2.

The minerals\r\ncontaining Fe₂O₃ are compared with those containing TiO₂. The former,\r\nmagnetite and hematite, are called _hemic_, mnemonic of hematite; the\r\nlatter subgroup, titanite, ilmenite, perofskite, rutile, are called\r\ntilic, mnemonic of titanite and ilmenite. Of orders 4 and 5, there are\r\n\r\nSuborder 1. H   7\r\n            — > —, hemic minerals extreme, _perhemic_.\r\n            T   1\r\n\r\n         2.

For the salic minerals, forming orders in the first\r\nthree classes, the bases are alkalies—K₂O and Na₂O—and lime, CaO. For\r\nthe femic minerals, forming orders in the last two classes, the bases\r\nare MgO, FeO, CaO and alkalies, K₂O, Na₂O. In classes I, II, and III\r\nrangs are formed by comparing salic alkalies, K₂O′ + Na₂O′, with salic\r\nlime, CaO′; and subrangs are formed by comparing K₂O′ with Na₂O′.\r\n\r\nRang 1.

Thus\r\ngrads in classes II and III correspond to orders in class IV and the\r\nreverse. Subgrads are the same in form as rangs when the difference in\r\nthe treatment of salic and femic minerals is borne in mind. The names\r\ngiven to these divisions, which in fact recognize only the character of\r\nthe magma, are derived from geographical localities and embrace many of\r\nthose already in use, except that the names of orders are taken from\r\ncountries or nations. Specific terminations indicate the place in the\r\nseries of divisions:\r\n\r\n  _ane_ for class, _one_ for subclass.\r\n  _are_ for order, _ore_ for suborder.\r\n  _ase_ for rang, _ose_ for subrang.\r\n  _ate_ for grad, _ote_ for subgrad.\r\n\r\nThis may be illustrated as follows:\r\n\r\nClass I. _persalane_, all rocks extremely salic.\r\n\r\nOrder 4. _britannare_, feldspar dominant over quartz, quardofelic. Many\r\nrocks of granitic composition whether crystalline or glassy.\r\n\r\nRang 1. _liparase_, peralkalic, rocks in which the potential feldspars\r\nare extremely alkalic, orthoclase, or albite.\r\n\r\nSubrang 2. _Omeose_, dopotassic, rocks in which the extremely alkali\r\nfeldspars are dominantly potassic, orthoclase, with subordinate albite.\r\nExamples of omeose are: granite from Omeo, Victoria, Australia, and\r\nrhyolite from Silver Cliff, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe presence of distinctive minerals not indicated in the standard\r\nmineral composition of _norm_ is expressed by qualifying the magmatic\r\nname by the name of the distinctive mineral; as, a hornblende-monzonose.\r\n\r\nThe precise texture of the rock is expressed by qualifying the magmatic\r\nname by a textural adjective; as, a grano-monzonose, a vitro-monzonose,\r\na phyro-monzonose, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n              REFERENCE LIST OF THE MORE COMMON MINERALS.\r\n\r\n=Actinolite=—a magnesium-calcium-iron amphibole (q.v.);

a term which may\r\nwell come into more general use to distinguish the silicate sands that\r\narise from the disaggregation, but only partial decomposition, of basic\r\nrocks, as arkose does, the like products of the acidic or granitoid\r\nrocks, and as sandstone does, the granular products of complete\r\nchemical decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORE-DEPOSITS.[207]\r\n\r\nOre-deposits are but a special phase of the rock-forming processes\r\nalready discussed. They have peculiar interest because of their\r\nindustrial value. An ore is simply a rock that contains a metal that\r\ncan be profitably extracted, though for convenience the term is used\r\nmore broadly to include unworkable lean ores and ore material. The\r\nmetal need not preponderate or form any fixed percentage of the whole,\r\nfor the criterion is solely economic and not petrologic. A gold ore\r\nrarely contains more than a very small fraction of one percent. of the\r\nprecious metal, while high-grade iron ore yields sixty-odd percent.\r\nof the metal. In iron ore, the metallic oxide or carbonate makes up\r\nnearly the whole rock; in gold ore, the metal is the merest incidental\r\nconstituent, from the petrologic point of view.\r\n\r\n=Concentration.=—The essential fact in the formation of ores is the\r\nunusual concentration of the metal. There are vast quantities of\r\nall the metals disseminated through the rock substance of the earth\r\nand even throughout the hydrosphere, but they do not constitute\r\nores because they have no economic value. They become ores when\r\nconcentrated in accessible places to a workable richness. The degree\r\nof concentration required is measured by the value of the metal. The\r\nessential elements for consideration are, therefore, (1) the original\r\ndistribution of the metallic materials through the rocks, (2) their\r\nsolution by circulating waters (or, rarely, by other means), (3)\r\ntheir transportation in solution to the place of deposit, (4) their\r\nprecipitation in concentrated form, and (5) perhaps their further\r\nconcentration and purification by subsequent processes.\r\n\r\n=Exceptional and doubtful cases.=—There are a few cases where\r\nore-deposits are made by volcanic fumes or vapors, but these may\r\nbe neglected here. Formerly, ores were often attributed to vapors\r\nsupposed to arise from the hot interior, but this mode of origin seems\r\nincompatible with physical conditions. Ores have been attributed to\r\nwater originally contained as steam in lavas, and to waters escaping\r\nfrom the interior of the earth, these waters being supposed to be\r\nespecially mineralized. Direct evidence on this point is obviously\r\nbeyond reach. Segregation in the molten state is recognized as a source\r\nof ores, but its function is probably confined chiefly to partial\r\nenrichment as stated below. There are other occasional methods, but the\r\nchief process of concentration, immeasurably surpassing all others,\r\nconsists in the leaching out of ore materials disseminated through the\r\ncountry rock and their redeposition in segregated forms, as an incident\r\nof the recognized system of water circulation.\r\n\r\n=Original distribution.=—The original distribution of ore material\r\nthrough the primitive rocks is beyond the ken of present science,\r\nfor even the nature of the true primitive rocks is unknown. For\r\npresent purposes it is sufficient to regard all rocks concerned in\r\nore-deposition as either igneous or sedimentary, and to inquire, as\r\na first step, how far ordinary igneous and sedimentary processes\r\ncontribute to the segregation of ore material, leaving for a second\r\nstage of inquiry the subsequent processes of concentration.\r\n\r\n=Magmatic segregation.=—In a few instances workable masses of ore seem\r\nto have arisen from lavas by direct segregation in the molten state,\r\nwithout the aid of subsequent concentration by water action, on which\r\nmost ores are dependent. It is not improbable that the segregation\r\nof metallic iron and nickel, and perhaps other metals, in the deeper\r\nparts of the earth may be a prevalent process, giving rise to masses\r\nlike the native iron found in basalt in Greenland. This iron closely\r\nresembles the nickel-irons of meteorites, which may be illustrations\r\nof similar action in small planetary bodies that have been disrupted.\r\nMetallic masses so segregated presumably gravitate toward the planetary\r\ncenter and hence, whatever their inherent interest, have little\r\nrelation to a subject whose basal criterion is economic. It is not at\r\nall improbable, however, that in the magmatic differentiation of the\r\nlavas that come to the surface, there is some metallic segregation that\r\nmay make the enriched parts effective ground for the concentrating\r\nprocesses of water circulation, and so determine the location of\r\nore-deposits. Igneous rocks are not equally the seats of ore-deposits,\r\neven when the circulatory conditions seem to be equally favorable.\r\nThese conditions may not really be equally favorable, but there is\r\ngood ground to believe that some igneous masses constitute a richer\r\nfield for concentration than others. No definite rule, however,\r\nfor distinguishing rich varieties of rock from lean ones has been\r\ndetermined. The basic igneous rocks are, on the whole, perhaps somewhat\r\nricher in ores than the acidic class, but there is no established law.\r\nMany acidic rocks bear more and richer ores than many basic ones. The\r\nview here entertained is that both classes are subject to regional\r\nenrichment through conditions connected with their origin, as yet\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\n=Marine segregation and dispersion.=—In the formation of the\r\nsedimentary rocks from the primitive and igneous rocks there was\r\nnotable metallic concentration in some cases, and even more notable\r\ndepletion in others. The ground-waters of the land, after their\r\nsubterranean circuits, carried into the water-basins various metallic\r\nsubstances in solution. These were either precipitated early in the\r\nmarine or lacustrine drift of the waters, or became diffused throughout\r\nthe oceanic body. In the main they appear to have been widely diffused,\r\nand either to have remained long in solution, or to have been very\r\nsparsely deposited through the marine or lacustrine sediments. As a\r\nrule, these sediments seem to contain less of valuable ore material\r\nthan igneous rocks, and this is rational, for, as we shall see, the\r\nground-water circulation of the land tends to concentrate and hold back\r\na part of the metallic content of the land rocks so that only a residue\r\nreaches the sea. But there are important exceptions to this general\r\nrule of sedimentary leanness.\r\n\r\nThe iron-ore beds of Clinton age ranging from New York to Alabama, and\r\nappearing also in Wisconsin and Nova Scotia, form a stratum in the\r\nmidst of the ordinary sediments, and contain marine fossils. The great\r\nore beds of Lake Superior were originally of similar type, and so are\r\nmost other important iron deposits. It cannot be said, in most cases,\r\nthat these iron deposits are marine as distinguished from lacustrine or\r\nlodgment deposits, but they are at least sedimentary. The ferruginous\r\nmaterial was originally disseminated widely through antecedent land\r\nrocks, but was concentrated in the course of the sedimentary processes.\r\n\r\nLimestone appears to have been sometimes enriched locally in lead and\r\nzinc, and more rarely in copper, in the course of its sedimentation.\r\nThe lead and zinc regions of the Mississippi basin have been regarded\r\nas dependent on such regional enrichment as a primary condition. This\r\nlocalized enrichment has been attributed to solutions brought into the\r\nsea from neighboring metal-bearing lands and precipitated by organic\r\naction in the sea-water,[208] this organic action being more effective\r\nin some areas than in others because of the unequal distribution of\r\nlife and the concentration of its decaying products. It is assumed\r\nthat such precipitates were at first too diffuse to be of value, and\r\nfurther concentration was required to bring them together into workable\r\ndeposits; but the further processes appear to have been effective only\r\nwhere the preliminary enrichment had taken place. At any rate, the\r\nworkable deposits are singularly localized, while the concentrative\r\nprocesses are very general.\r\n\r\nMetallic material is sometimes partially concentrated in sandstones\r\nand shales in the process of sedimentation, though more rarely. The\r\ncopper-bearing shale (Kupferschiefer) of the Zechstein group in\r\nGermany, so extensively worked along the flanks of the Harz Mountains,\r\nis a striking example.\r\n\r\nIt is in every way reasonable to suppose that land-waters, on reaching\r\nthe margins of the water-basins, must occasionally find conditions\r\nfavorable for the precipitation of their metallic contents, and that\r\nthe ratio of these precipitates to other material might be relatively\r\nhigh in the more favorable situations, and that this enrichment of the\r\ncountry rock may be a condition precedent to a sufficient subsequent\r\nconcentration to yield workable accumulations.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, inferred that while the processes of sedimentation\r\ntended on the whole to leanness, they gave rise to (1) some very\r\nimportant ore-deposits, notably the chief iron ores, the greatest of\r\nall ores in quantity and in real industrial value, and (2) a diffuse\r\nenrichment of certain other areas which made them productive under\r\nsubsequent concentrative processes, while the sedimentary formations in\r\ngeneral were left barren.\r\n\r\n=Origin of ore regions.=—From these considerations it appears that for\r\nthe fundamental explanation of “mining regions” we must look mainly (1)\r\nto magmatic differentiation, so far as the country rock is igneous, and\r\n(2) to sedimentary enrichment, so far as the rock is secondary. The\r\ndetermining conditions in both cases are obscure and unpredictable, but\r\nthe recognition of such regions, and of the function of preliminary\r\ndiffuse regional enrichment, contributes to a comprehensive view of\r\nthe complex processes of ore concentration. The subsequent processes\r\nconsist in the further concentration of the ore material into sheets,\r\nlodes, veins, and similar aggregations by ground-water circulation,\r\nor else in the purification of the ores by the removal of useless or\r\ndeleterious material, or in both combined.\r\n\r\n=Surface residual concentration.=—The simplest of all modes of\r\nconcentration takes place in the formation of mantle-rock. An insoluble\r\nor slightly soluble metallic substance sparsely distributed through a\r\nrock may be concentrated to working value by the decay and removal of\r\nthe main rock material, leaving the metallic material in the residuary\r\nmantle. The tin ores of the Malay peninsula[209] are especially good\r\nexamples. The crystals of tin oxide were originally scattered sparsely\r\nthrough granite and limestone, but by their decay and partial removal\r\nit has accumulated in workable quantities. Certain gold fields and\r\ncertain iron ores have acquired higher values in the same way. Such\r\nresiduary material may be further concentrated by wash into gulches\r\nor alluvial flats, in the course of which the lighter parts of the\r\nmantle-rock are largely carried away, and the heavier, including the\r\nmetal or its compounds, are mainly left behind. Gold placers are the\r\nbest example. The mining of placers by hydraulic processes is but a\r\nfurther extension of the natural process of concentration.\r\n\r\nSuch concentrates in past ages have in some cases been buried by later\r\ndeposits, and hence certain ancient sandstones, conglomerates, and\r\nmantle-rocks have become ore-bearing horizons. The Rand of South Africa\r\nappears to be of this type.\r\n\r\n=Purification and concentration.=—A somewhat different mode of\r\nconcentration and purification has affected certain of the great iron\r\ndeposits. As already explained, the iron compounds were originally\r\ndissolved from the iron-bearing constituents of the primitive or of\r\nigneous rocks, or their derivatives, and were deposited in beds as\r\nchemical stratiform deposits. In some cases they were sufficiently\r\npure, as first precipitated, to be worked profitably, but in most cases\r\nthey were seriously affected by undesirable mineral associates. When,\r\nhowever, such impure deposits are subjected for long periods to the\r\npercolation of waters from the surface under favorable conditions,\r\nthe impurities are often dissolved and the ores concentrated. The\r\ngreat Bessemer ore-deposits of Lake Superior are examples. Originally\r\nimpure carbonates or silicates, they have been converted into rich and\r\nphenomenally pure ferric oxides along certain lines of ground-water\r\ncirculation, and in certain areas of free leaching. Van Hise has shown\r\nthe definite relation between the water circulation and the production\r\nof the high-grade ores.[210] Vast quantities of unconcentrated lean\r\nores lie in the tracts not thus purified and enriched by circulating\r\nwaters. This does not appear to be simply residual concentration. The\r\nwaters seem to have added ferric oxide brought from above, while they\r\ncarried away the “impurities,” silica, carbon dioxide, etc. Perhaps\r\nthis is an instance of mass action in which the ore present aided in\r\ncausing additions to itself.\r\n\r\n=Concentration by solution and reprecipitation.=—By a process almost\r\nthe opposite of residual concentration, ore material is often\r\nleached out of the surface-rock by water circulating slowly through\r\nits pores, cleavage planes, and minute crevices, and is carried on\r\nwith the circulation until it reaches some substance which causes a\r\nreaction that precipitates the ore material. This substance may be a\r\nconstituent of some rock which the circulating water encounters, such\r\nas organic matter. More commonly, the precipitation seems to be due\r\nto the mingling of waters charged with different mineral substances,\r\nthe mingling inducing reaction and the precipitation of the ore.\r\nPrecipitation, however, does not necessarily follow such commingling.\r\nThe junctions of underground waterways are sometimes characterized by\r\nbarrenness instead of richness. In the expressive phraseology of the\r\nminers, a tributary current sometimes “makes” and sometimes “cuts out.”\r\nIn chemical phrase, when the mingling waters reduce the solubility\r\nof the appropriate substance sufficiently, an ore-deposit is formed;\r\nwhen they increase its solubility, they promote barrenness. Changes of\r\npressure and temperature may enter into the process, and mass action\r\nmay lend its aid when once a deposit is started.\r\n\r\nMore concretely stated, the general process of underground ore\r\nformation appears to be this: the permeating waters dissolve the ore\r\nmaterial disseminated through the rock and carry it thence into the\r\nmain channels of circulation, usually the fissures, broken tracts,\r\nporous belts, or cavernous spaces. If precipitating conditions are\r\nfound there, deposition takes place. The precipitating conditions\r\nmay be merely changes of physical state, such as cooling or relief\r\nof pressure, but probably much more generally they consist in the\r\ncommingling and mutual reaction of waters that have pursued different\r\ncourses and become differently mineralized, as implied above. In these\r\ncases the metal-bearing current may be scarcely more important than the\r\nprecipitating current.\r\n\r\nSince the solvent action is a condition precedent to deposition, the\r\nlocation of the greatest solvent action first invites attention. At\r\npresent it must be treated in general terms, for it is not known what\r\nsolutions must be formed beyond the fact that they must include the\r\nore material. Probably they must include much besides. Furthermore,\r\nit is not known that deep-seated rocks carry more ore material than\r\nsimilar rocks at or near the surface or at any other horizon. Fantastic\r\nconceptions of deep-seated metallic richness are to be shunned as quite\r\nbeyond practical consideration. The water circulation is probably very\r\nslight below a depth of two or three miles at most, and above that\r\ndepth there is little ground to suppose that the rocks of one horizon\r\nare inherently more metalliferous than others of their kind. There is\r\nno assignable reason why the igneous rocks at the surface are not as\r\nrich in ore material as the igneous rocks two or three miles below,\r\nsince all are probably eruptive and of much the same nature on the\r\nwhole, being in many cases parts of the same eruptions.\r\n\r\n=Location of greatest solvent action.=—Solvent action is probably most\r\n_intense_ where the temperature and pressure are highest, that is, in\r\nthe deeper reaches of water circulation; but the _amount_ of water\r\npassing in and out of the deeper zone is but a small fraction of that\r\nwhich courses through the upper horizons, and the total solvent action\r\nis quite certainly much greater in the upper zone than in the lower. At\r\nthe same time the solutions in the upper zone are quite certainly more\r\ndilute than those below. The horizon of greatest solution lies between\r\nthe surface and a level slightly below the ground-water surface, or, in\r\nother words, in the zone where atmosphere and hydrosphere coöperate.\r\nSurface-waters are charged with atmospheric and organic acids and\r\nother solvents, and their general effect upon the rocks is markedly\r\nsolvent down to or often below the permanent water-level. In this zone\r\nconcentration by residual accumulation may take place, as already\r\nnoted, if the metallic compounds resist solution; otherwise this zone\r\nis depleted of its ore material by solution, and preparation is made\r\nfor deposition elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSolution also continues to take place varyingly as the water descends\r\nbelow this zone of dominant solution, and extends probably to the full\r\ndepth of water circulation, but in the deeper circuit, precipitation\r\nalso takes place and the action becomes complex. With the waters\r\ntaking up and throwing down material at the same time, it is difficult\r\nto estimate the balance of results.\r\n\r\nWhen waters that have been mineralized near the surface descend, they\r\noften take on a precipitating phase at no great depth below the upper\r\nlevel of the ground-water; thus sulphides that were oxidized and\r\ndissolved near the surface are reprecipitated, often at horizons not\r\ngreatly below the permanent water-level. Waters that dissolve metallic\r\nsubstances in the upper levels often become charged with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen and other precipitants within a few scores or a few hundreds\r\nof feet of the surface, as deep wells abundantly prove. The freshness\r\nof surface which metallic sulphides often exhibit at these levels is\r\nfair ground for inferring recency of deposition and absence of solvent\r\naction. Actual demonstrations of depositions in progress are not\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n=Short-course action.=—The concentration which thus takes place by\r\nsolution in the upper zone, followed closely by reprecipitation within\r\na few score or a few hundred feet, may well be termed the _short-course\r\nmode_ of ore concentration. It finds its most important illustration in\r\nwhat is commonly known as the “secondary enrichment” of ore-deposits.\r\nThe ores in the outcropping edge of the vein or lode are dissolved\r\nby the surface-waters, carried a short distance down the ore tract\r\nand redeposited, causing enrichment at that point. This is only a\r\nspecial case of what takes place generally at this horizon. It is\r\neffective in this case because it has a previous partial concentration\r\nto work upon. Secondary enrichments of this kind often contain most\r\nor all the workable values of the ore tract. If instead of a previous\r\nconcentration in a vein, lode, or similar ore tract, there had been\r\npartial concentration in the country rock by sedimentation, as in the\r\ncase of iron-ore beds and perhaps lead-, zinc-, and copper-impregnated\r\nsediments, the short-course method may give working values not before\r\npossessed. In some of the more obscure cases of previous partial\r\nconcentration in the crystalline and other rocks, it is probably this\r\nshort-course action that brings the concentration up to working value.\r\nIt is probably effective also in concentrating the metallic contents\r\nof certain igneous rocks that were rich in metallic material when\r\nextruded. How far this is true has been, and still remains, a mooted\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n=Long-course action.=—After the surface-waters have once passed through\r\na cycle of dissolving and precipitating action, as they are apt to\r\ndo within the first few hundred feet of their courses below the\r\nwater-level, they are liable to pass through a succession of dissolving\r\nand depositing stages, each reaction resulting in a state that makes\r\na new reaction possible. This is especially true if the waters pursue\r\ndeep courses. Strictly speaking, the precipitations usually concern\r\nonly a part of the substances dissolved. New substances are often\r\ntaken up in the very act of throwing down those already held, and the\r\nway thus prepared for further changes. If the water pursues a deep\r\nand devious course, it may receive additions by solution and suffer\r\nlosses by precipitation at many points in its course, both descending\r\nand ascending. The changes are very complex, and in the case of a deep\r\nor long circuit where various rocks, pressures, and temperatures are\r\nencountered, the history becomes one long succession of complexities,\r\nthe full nature of which is not yet revealed.\r\n\r\nIn the deeper circuits, each individual current usually takes on a\r\ndescending, a lateral, and ascending phase, the three being necessary\r\nto complete a circuit. The chemical conditions of the waters in the\r\nthree phases are probably not sharply distinguished from one another,\r\nand hence there seems to be no defined horizon of concentration\r\ncomparable to that near the water-level already described. The chief\r\ndistinctions in the deeper regions relate to pressure, temperature,\r\nlength or depth of penetration, and duration of contact. It seems safe\r\nto assume, as a general truth, that, other things being equal, the\r\nsolutions become more complex and more nearly reach general saturation\r\nthe farther and the deeper the waters penetrate.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a mooted question whether ore-deposits are due chiefly\r\nto descending, to lateral, or to ascending currents. The question in\r\nits usual form is too undiscriminating for advantageous discussion, but\r\nif the ore-deposits due to surface or short-course concentrations and\r\nreconcentrations be set aside, as in some sense a separate class, the\r\nrelative functions of the descending, the lateral, and the ascending\r\nportions of the deeper circulations become a measurably definite\r\nquestion. Two great working factors enter into the comparison: (1) much\r\ngreater circulation in the upper zone, where lateral movement most\r\nprevails; (2) much greater heat and pressure in the lower zone, where\r\nthe circulation must be chiefly vertical.\r\n\r\nHeat and pressure in general favor solution, and hence so far as this\r\nfactor goes, descending water is likely to be increasing its mineral\r\ncontent, rather than diminishing it by deposition. But this is\r\nonly general; particular elements of the solution may be deposited.\r\nIn ascending, as the same water must later, it is predisposed to\r\ndeposition from loss of solvent power through reduction of pressure\r\nand temperature. The theoretical balance is here clearly in favor\r\nof preponderant deposition by the ascending portion of the current.\r\nSo far as precipitation is dependent on the mingling of differently\r\nmineralized waters, descending and ascending currents seem to be\r\nsituated much alike, in general, for both are subject to accessions and\r\nmutual unions.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water that circulates in the deeper horizons is much less\r\nthan that nearer the surface. Allowing a few hundred, or at most one\r\nor two thousand feet for the special short-circuit zone next below the\r\nwater-level (it is known to reach 1000 to 1500 feet in some cases),\r\nthe water circulating through the next 1000 or 2000 feet is probably\r\nseveral times greater than all that circulates at greater depths, and\r\nthis greater circulation above doubtless offsets, in greater or less\r\nmeasure, the intensified action of the deeper circulation. Much of the\r\nupper and more rapid circulation is lateral, being actuated by the\r\nsloping surface of the ground-water, which in turn is determined by\r\ntopography, precipitation, and other surface conditions. Theoretical\r\nconsiderations, therefore, favor the view that lateral flow is\r\nan important factor in the concentration of ore material. But as\r\ndescending and lateral currents almost inevitably meet and mingle\r\nwith ascending currents, it is difficult to distinguish, in the\r\nore-deposits, the special functions of each phase of action. It is even\r\nmore difficult to determine whether the different phases are not alike\r\nessential to the mutual reactions on which the deposition depends.\r\nIt may be as necessary to have a precipitant as to have a metallic\r\nconstituent in solution to be precipitated, and what is more, this\r\nprecipitating agency may be a substance of no economic value in itself\r\nand of no obvious relations to the substances that form the ores. If\r\nthe deposition is due solely to a physical state, as relief of pressure\r\nor lowering of temperature, these considerations do not hold.\r\n\r\n=Summary.=—The general results are probably these: In the deeper\r\ncircuits, more ore material is brought upward and deposited than is\r\ncarried downward and deposited, so that metallic values are shifted\r\ntoward accessible horizons. In the lateral currents, more metallic\r\nvalues are shifted toward the trunk-lines of circulation—the great\r\ncrevices and other waterways—than are carried from these into the rock\r\nand distributed, and lateral segregation results. At the same time\r\nthe atmospheric waters acting at or near the surface concentrate ore\r\nvalues downwards. _The sum total of these processes is to promote the\r\ndevelopment of the higher ore values in accessible horizons, and along\r\nthe main lines of circulation._\r\n\r\n=The influence of contacts.=—As ore-deposits depend on a dissolving\r\nstate followed by a depositing state of the waters, and perhaps on a\r\ncomplex succession of these alterations, it is obvious that conditions\r\nwhich favor changes of state and the commingling of different kinds\r\nof water are apt to be favorable to ore production. At any rate it is\r\nobserved that many important ore-deposits occur at the contact between\r\nformations of different character. The contact of igneous rock with\r\nlimestone is a rather notable instance. It is not to be inferred that\r\nsuch contacts are generally accompanied by workable ore-deposits, but\r\nmerely that a notable proportion of workable ore-deposits occur at such\r\njunctions. It is rational to suppose that where the chemical nature of\r\nthe two formations is in contrast, the waters that percolate through\r\nthe one are likely to be mineralized very differently from those that\r\ncourse through the other, and hence that on mingling at the contact,\r\nreactions are specially liable to take place, and that when a valuable\r\nmetallic substance is present it is liable to be involved and by chance\r\nto suffer precipitation. Reactions are the more probable because the\r\ncontact is likely to be a plane of crustal movement, and hence more or\r\nless open and accompanied by fractures, zones of crushed rock and other\r\nconditions that facilitate circulation and offer suitable places for\r\nore formation.\r\n\r\n=The effect of igneous intrusions.=—A special case of much importance\r\narises when lavas are intruded into sediments that have previously been\r\npartially enriched in the ways above described. The igneous intrusion\r\nnot only introduces new contact zones, and more or less fracturing,\r\nbut it brings into play hot waters with their intensified solvent\r\nwork, their more active circulation, and the reaction between waters\r\nof different temperatures. The special efficiency of these agencies is\r\nbelieved to be the determining factor in many cases.\r\n\r\n=The influence of rock walls.=—The rock walls themselves are thought\r\nsometimes to be a factor in ore-precipitating reactions. By mass\r\naction, they may withdraw a constituent of the solution and destroy\r\nits equilibrium in such a way as to cause the precipitation of the\r\nmetallic constituent. Once deposited on the walls ores aid, by mass\r\naction, the further accretion of ores.\r\n\r\nThe special forms which ores assume in deposition, as beds, veins,\r\nlodes, stockworks, disseminations, segregations, etc., are chiefly\r\nincidental to the local situation in which the essential chemical or\r\nphysical change takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                   STRUCTURAL (GEOTECTONIC) GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The structural phases which rocks assume.=—In the previous chapters,\r\nthe general method by which rocks are formed has been set forth, and\r\nmany of their structural features have been touched upon incidentally.\r\nIt remains to assemble the structural features already mentioned, and\r\nto consider certain additional structural phases which rocks assume.\r\n\r\n\r\n               STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\nIn the deposition of sediments in the sea, or in other bodies of\r\nstanding water, the coarser portion of the material is usually\r\ndeposited in the shallow water near the shore where the wave-action\r\nis strongest, and the less coarse of various grades is deposited at\r\ngreater and greater distances from the land, while only extremely\r\nfine silt is usually carried out to abysmal depths (see p. 380). To\r\nthis general law of distribution there are important exceptions. Fine\r\nsediments are sometimes deposited near the shore, and where currents,\r\ntidal agitation, or floating ice are effective, coarse deposits are\r\noccasionally carried far out from the shore.\r\n\r\n=Stratification.=—Sedimentary rocks are usually arranged in more\r\nor less distinct layers; that is, they are _stratified_. The\r\nstratification consists primarily in the superposition of layers of\r\ndifferent constitution or different compactness on one another. Layers\r\nof like constitution or compactness are often separated by films of\r\ndifferent material which cause the partings between them. The bedded\r\narrangement of stratified rocks is due to various causes, but primarily\r\nto the varying agitation of the waters in which the sediment was laid\r\ndown. Where the depositing waters are agitated to the bottom, coarse\r\nsediment is likely to be deposited. Where the waters are quiet at the\r\nbottom, fine sediment is the rule. Since the agitation of the waters is\r\nsubject to frequent change, it follows that coarser material succeeds\r\nfiner, and finer coarser, in the same place. Hence arise _beds_,\r\n_layers_, and _laminæ_. The terms _layer_ and _bed_ are generally used\r\nas synonyms, while _laminæ_ are thinner divisions of the same sort.\r\nThe term stratum is sometimes applied to one layer and sometimes to\r\nall the consecutive layers of the same sort of rock. For the latter\r\nmeaning the term _formation_ is often used. Sometimes bedding seems\r\nto have been determined by strong currents which temporarily not only\r\nprevented deposition over a given area, but even cut away the loose\r\nsurface of deposits already made, giving a firm surface from which\r\nsucceeding deposits are distinct. This sequence of events is sometimes\r\nshown by the truncation of laminæ, and by other signs of erosion. The\r\ncommoner sorts of bedded rock are limestones, shales, sandstones, and\r\nconglomerates.\r\n\r\nThe bedding of _limestones_ is often caused by the introduction of thin\r\nfilms of clayey material which interrupt the continuity of the lime\r\naccumulation and cause natural partings. Sometimes, however, bedding\r\narises from variations in the physical condition of the lime sediment\r\nitself. Lamination is not usually conspicuous in pure limestone, though\r\nit may be well developed in the shaly phases of this rock. _Shales_ are\r\nnormally laminated as well as bedded, and the lamination is often more\r\nnotable than the thicker bedding. Bedding in shale may arise from the\r\nintroduction of sandy laminæ, or by notable changes in the texture of\r\nthe shale material. Similarly, _sandstones_ are sometimes divided into\r\nbeds by shaly (clayey) partings, but more often by variations in the\r\ncoarseness of the sand itself, or by the presence of laminæ that are\r\nless coherent than those above and below. Sometimes the layers appear\r\nto be determined by the compacting of the surface of sand already\r\naccumulated before it was buried by later deposits. Sandstones may\r\nbe thick- or thin-bedded, and their bedding passes insensibly into\r\nlamination.\r\n\r\nSand deposits usually take place in relatively shallow water, and\r\nthe sand is subjected to much shifting before it finds a permanent\r\nlodgment. In the course of this shifting, bars are formed which usually\r\nhave a rather steep face in the direction in which they are being\r\nshifted. The sand carried over the top of the bar finds lodgment on\r\nthe sloping terrace face. The inclined laminæ thus formed constitute\r\na kind of bedding, but since its planes do not conform to the general\r\nhorizontal attitude of the formation as a whole, it is called _false-_\r\nor _cross-bedding_ or, more accurately, _cross-lamination_ (see Fig.\r\n368). The same structure is developed on delta fronts and generally in\r\nwater shallow enough to be subject to frequent agitation at the bottom.\r\nSandstone is cross-bedded more commonly than other sorts of sedimentary\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nThe bedding of _conglomerate_ is due chiefly to variations in\r\ncoarseness. Laminæ or thicker layers of sand are frequently found\r\nbetween layers of coarser material. Conglomerate is likely to be\r\nthick-bedded, and cross-bedding is common.\r\n\r\n=Lateral gradation.=—When the varying nature of the agitation of\r\nthe sea at different depths and along the different parts of the\r\ncoast-border, and during different phases of the sea-currents, is\r\nconsidered, it will be readily understood that sedimentary beds are\r\naffected by many irregularities, and that deposits of one kind grade\r\ninto others horizontally with great freedom. Thus a bed of conglomerate\r\n(gravel) may grade laterally into sandstone, and this into shale or\r\nlimestone. It is indeed rather more remarkable that the sedimentary\r\nstrata should be as regular and persistent as they are, than that they\r\nsometimes grade into one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 368.—Cross-bedding in sandstone. Dells of the\r\n  Wisconsin near Kilbourn, Wis. (Bennett.)]\r\n\r\n=Special markings.=—The rhythmical action of waves gives rise to\r\nundulatory lodgment, known as _ripple-marks_ (Fig. 324). They are\r\nusually not the direct product of the surface-waves, since they are\r\nmuch too small. They are produced mainly by the vibratory movement of\r\nthe undertow, but they apparently result from various other phases of\r\nvibratory agitation of the bottom waters. They are sometimes made by\r\nstreams and stream-like currents. Ripple-marks are apparently preserved\r\nindefinitely under proper circumstances. They are sometimes found, for\r\nexample, on very ancient quartzites. Ripples are also made by wind\r\n(p. 37). Ripple-marks are usually only an inch or two from crest to\r\ncrest, but in rare instances they attain much greater size. Examples\r\nof ripple-marks 30 feet across are known.[211] Occasional ridges\r\nand depressions of much greater dimensions are produced which are\r\nattributable to the formation of successive bars, or to the building\r\nof wave-cusps.[212] _Rill-marks_ are not infrequently produced by the\r\nundertow and other currents passing over pebbles, shells, etc. (Figs.\r\n325 and 326).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 369.—Mud-cracks in Brunswick Shale, N. J.\r\n  (Kümmel.)]\r\n\r\nSediments are sometimes exposed between tides, or under other\r\ncircumstances, for periods long enough to permit drying and cracking at\r\nthe surface. On the return of the waters, the cracks may be filled and\r\npermanently preserved. These are known as _sun-cracks_ or _mud-cracks_\r\n(Figs. 328 and 369). They chiefly affect shales, but are occasionally\r\nseen in limestones and fine-grained sandstones. During the exposure of\r\nthe sediments a shower may pass and _rain-drop impressions_ (Fig. 370)\r\nbe made which are subsequently filled by fine sediment and preserved.\r\nThe size and depth of rain-drop impressions give some hint as to the\r\nmeteorological conditions of far-off ages. _Wave-marks_, which consist\r\nof the faint line-ridges developed on a sandy beach at the limit of the\r\nincoming wave, are sometimes preserved and may be seen occasionally on\r\nlayers of rock deposited millions of years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 370.—Rain-drop impressions. (Brigham.)]\r\n\r\n=Concretionary structure.=—Various sedimentary formations contain\r\nnodules or irregularly shaped masses of mineral matter unlike the\r\nrock in which they occur. When these nodules consist of matter\r\naggregated about some center, they are called _concretions_. They\r\nare common in sedimentary rocks, and here it may sometimes be\r\nseen that the aggregation has taken place about a shell, a leaf,\r\nor some other organic relic. The nuclei are, however, not always\r\norganic. The material of the concretion may have come from the\r\nimmediately surrounding rock, having been first dissolved by water\r\nand then deposited about the nucleus, or it may have been introduced\r\nfrom without, likewise by the agency of water. In the first case,\r\nthe mineral matter of the concretion is usually one of the minor\r\nconstituents of the rock. Thus the commonest concretions in limestone\r\nare composed of impure silica (chert, Fig. 361); in shale, of lime\r\ncarbonate or iron sulphide; in sandstone, of iron oxide. The concretion\r\nmay be made up almost wholly of concentrated matter, in which case\r\nthe matter originally in the place of the concretion has been crowded\r\naside; or it may involve much of the material of the imbedding rock.\r\nThus the concretion of lime carbonate in shale may be nearly pure,\r\nor it may involve much of the earthy matter of the shale, while the\r\nconcretion of iron oxide in sandstone commonly includes much sand. In\r\nextreme cases, indeed, the concentrated matter of the concretion merely\r\ncements the material involved into distinct nodules. Occasionally the\r\nrock substance itself takes on a concretionary form, all or most of its\r\nmaterial being involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 371.—Discoid calcareous concretions from\r\n post-glacial clays.

Surv.)]\r\n\r\nIn size, concretions may vary from microscopic dimensions to huge\r\nmasses, 8, 10, or even more feet in diameter. The variations in shape\r\nare also great. They may be spherical, elliptical, discoid, or they\r\nmay assume more irregular and complex forms (Figs. 371 and 372). The\r\nconditions of growth have much to do with the form. Thus a concretion\r\nwhich starts as a sphere may find growth easier in one plane than\r\nanother, when it becomes discoid. Two or more concretions sometimes\r\ngrow together, giving rise to complicated forms. Some of the most\r\ncomplex and fantastic forms are perhaps to be explained in this way.\r\nConcretions sometimes take the form of tubes. Some minute tubular\r\nconcretions were formed about rootlets, but the larger ones appear to\r\nowe their form to other influences (Fig. 374).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 375.—Section of a concretion (_septarium_) the\r\n  cracks of which have been filled by matter deposited from solution.\r\n  About half natural size. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 376.—Section of a concretion, the cracks in which\r\n  have been filled by deposition from solution.

About half natural size. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary features of some concretions of\r\n  complex form is their symmetry. This may be of various phases; in\r\n  exceptional cases there is a bilateral symmetry almost as perfect as\r\n  in the higher types of animals. This is especially true of certain\r\n  calcareous concretions developed in plastic clays (Fig. 373).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 377.—Septarium from Cretaceous clays near the\r\n  east base of the Rocky Mountains in Montana. (Photo. by Church.)]\r\n\r\nConcretions sometimes develop cracks within themselves, and these may\r\nthen be filled with mineral matter differing in composition or color\r\nfrom that of the original concretions (Figs. 375 and 376). Concretions\r\nthe cracks of which have been filled by deposition from solution,\r\nare called _septaria_. They are especially abundant in some of the\r\nCretaceous shales and clays. In not a few cases the filling of the\r\ncracks appears to have wedged segments of the original concretion\r\nfarther and farther apart, until the outer surface of the septarium is\r\nmade up more largely of vein-matter than of the original concretion\r\n(Fig. 377). Such concretions are often popularly known as “petrified\r\nturtles.”\r\n\r\nConcretions of the sort indicated above often develop after the\r\nenclosing sedimentary rock was deposited. This is shown, among other\r\nthings, by the fact that numerous planes of lamination may sometimes be\r\ntraced through the concretions.\r\n\r\nConcretions also form in water during the deposition of sedimentary\r\nrock. Exceptionally, sedimentary rock is made up chiefly of\r\nconcretions. The chemical precipitates from the concentrated waters\r\nof certain enclosed lakes sometimes take the form of minute spherules\r\nwhich resemble the roe of fish. From this resemblance the resulting\r\nrock is called _oolite_ (Fig. 357). Oolite is now forming about some\r\ncoral reefs, presumably from the precipitation of the lime carbonate\r\nwhich was temporarily in solution. Considerable beds of limestone\r\nare sometimes oolitic. The calcium carbonate of such rock may be\r\nsubsequently replaced by silica, so that the oolitic structure is\r\nsometimes found in silicious rock. If the concretions become larger,\r\nsay as large as peas, the rock is called _pisolite_ instead of oolite\r\n(Fig. 378).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 378.—Pisolite. Half natural size. (Photo. by\r\n  Church.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 379.—Columnar structure, “Devil’s Post Pile.”\r\n  Upper San Joaquin Canyon, Sierra Nevada Mountains.]\r\n\r\nBeds of iron ore are likewise sometimes concretionary. Thus in the\r\nClinton formation there are widespread beds of “flaxseed” ore made up\r\nof concretions of iron oxide which, individually, resemble the seed\r\nwhich has given the ore its name. The nucleus in this case is usually\r\ntoo small for identification.\r\n\r\n=Secretions.=—When cavities in rock are filled by material deposited\r\nfrom solution, the result is sometimes called a _secretion_. Secretions\r\ntherefore grow from without toward a center, while concretions follow\r\nthe opposite order. Crystal-lined cavities (_geodes_, Fig. 359) and\r\nagates (Fig. 358) are examples of secretions. Crystal-lined cavities\r\nand veins are the same in principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nCertain structural features of igneous rocks have been mentioned in\r\ntreating of their origin in the previous chapter. When a great flow\r\nof lava spreads out upon the surface, there is no internal lamination\r\nor stratification, and the resulting rock is usually classified as\r\nmassive rather than stratified; but when a succession of flows occur,\r\neach individual flow forms a layer, and the series as a whole becomes\r\nstratiform. The successive flows are not usually coextensive. If the\r\nlater flows of the closing stages of a period of vulcanism fail to\r\nreach as far as the earlier ones, a terraced or step-like aspect is\r\ngiven to the region, whence the name _trap-rock_ (_trappe_, steps)\r\nis derived. Such lava sheets, especially if of basalt, often assume\r\na _columnar_ structure in cooling, the columns being rude six-sided\r\nprisms standing at right angles to the cooling surfaces (Figs. 379\r\nand 380). This phenomenon is usually best developed where the sheet\r\nis intruded between layers of preexisting rock in the form of sills.\r\nThe formation of the columns is sometimes regarded as a variety of\r\nconcretionary action, but more commonly as a result of contraction. The\r\nformer is suggested by the ball-and-socket ends of the sections of some\r\ncolumns (Fig. 382). The development of the columns by contraction may\r\nbe explained as follows: The surface of the homogeneous lava contracts\r\nabout equally in all directions on cooling. The contractile force may\r\nbe thought of as centering about equidistant points. About a given\r\npoint, the least number of cracks which will relieve the tension in all\r\ndirections is three (Fig. 383). If these radiate symmetrically from the\r\npoint, the angle between any two is 120°, the angle of the hexagonal\r\nprism. Similar radiating cracks from other centers complete the columns\r\n(Fig. 384). A five-sided column would arise from the failure of the\r\ncracks to develop about some one of the points (Fig. 385).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 380.—Columnar structure, obsidian cliff,\r\n  Yellowstone Park. (Iddings, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nWhen lava is forced into crevices or rises to the surface through\r\nfissures, and the residual portion solidifies in them, it gives rise\r\nto _dikes_, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 417 (not a true dike). Dikes\r\nare sometimes affected by columnar structure. In this case, as in all\r\nothers, the columns are likely to be at right angles to the cooling\r\nsurface. Lava solidifying in the passageway leading from the interior\r\nof a volcano gives rise to a _neck_ or _plug_. If the lava is forced\r\nbetween beds of rock in the form of a sheet, and solidifies there, it\r\nis called a _sill_. If, after rising to a certain point in the strata,\r\nthe lava arches the beds above into a dome, and forms a great lens-like\r\nor cistern-like mass, it constitutes a _laccolith_ (Fig. 334). If an\r\nintrusion of the laccolithic type faults the overlying beds instead\r\nof arching them, and especially if the vertical dimension of the\r\nintruded mass be great in comparison with its lateral dimensions, its\r\nshape is more like that of a plug or core. Such an intruded core is a\r\n_bysmalith_[213] (Fig. 124). Between the bysmalith and the laccolith\r\nthere are various gradations, just as between the laccolith and the\r\nsill. When lava forces aside the rocks at considerable depths or\r\nabsorbs them by solution or by “stoping,” and then solidifies in great\r\nmasses of irregular or undetermined forms, these masses are called\r\n_batholiths_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 381.—Sections of columns from Giant’s Causeway,\r\n  coast of Ireland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 382.—Ball-and-socket joints in columns of basalt.\r\n  (Scrope.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 383.—Diagram to illustrate the first stages in\r\n  the formation of hexagonal columns by contraction.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 384.—The completion of the hexagonal columns.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 385.—Diagram to illustrate the development of\r\n  five-sided columns.]\r\n\r\n_Volcanic cones_ are familiar structures built up about the vents of\r\n  active volcanoes, and will be discussed under vulcanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n             STRUCTURAL FEATURES ARISING FROM DISTURBANCE.\r\n\r\n=Inclination and folding of strata.=—The original attitude of beds,\r\nwhether formed by water or by lava-flows, is normally horizontal, or\r\nnearly so. Both kinds of deposits, however, occasionally take place\r\non considerable slopes. Modifications of the original attitude result\r\nfrom earth movements, and the measurement of these modifications is\r\nan important feature of field study. It is recorded in terms of _dip_\r\nand _strike_. The dip is the inclination of the beds referred to a\r\nhorizontal plane, as illustrated in Fig. 386, and is usually measured\r\nby a clinometer, the principle of which is shown in Fig. 387. In\r\nmeasuring the dip, the maximum angle is always taken. In Fig. 386, for\r\nexample, the angle would be less if the direction were either to the\r\nright or left of that indicated by the arrow. The direction as well as\r\nthe amount of the dip is always to be noted. This must be determined\r\nby the compass, to which the clinometer may be conveniently attached.\r\nDip 40°, S. 20° W. gives the full record of the position of the bed of\r\nrock under consideration. The strike is the direction of the horizontal\r\nedge of dipping beds, or more generally, the direction of a horizontal\r\nline on the surface of the beds. This is illustrated in Fig. 386. Since\r\nthe strike is always at right angles to the dip, the strike need not be\r\nrecorded if the direction of the dip is. Thus dip 40°, S. 20° W. is the\r\nsame as dip 40°, strike N. 70° W.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 386.—Diagram illustrating dip and strike.\r\n  (Geikie.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 387.—The clinometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 388.—Open anticline, near Hancock, Md.

Surv.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the beds incline in a single direction, they form a _monocline_.\r\nWhen beds are arched so as to incline away from one another, they\r\nform an up-fold or _anticline_ (Figs. 388 to 391). The anticline may\r\ndepart from its simple form, as shown in Figs. 390 and 391. When beds\r\nare curved downward so as to incline towards one another, they form\r\na _syncline_ (Fig. 392). When beds assume the position shown in Fig.\r\n393, the folds are said to be _isoclinal_. When they are arched so as\r\nto form a cone or dome, and incline in all directions from a central\r\npoint, they are said to have a _quaquaversal_ dip. When considerable\r\ntracts are bent so as to form great arches or great troughs with many\r\nminor undulations on the flanks of the larger, they are designated\r\nas _geanticlines_, or _anticlinoria_ (Figs. 394 and 395), and\r\n_geosynclines_ or _synclinoria_ (Figs. 396 and 397). Folding is often\r\naccompanied by the development of slaty cleavage (p. 440).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 393.—Isocline. (Van Hise, U. S. Geol.

The determination of anticlinal or\r\nsynclinal structure is then not based on topography, or even on such\r\nsections as shown in Figs. 394 to 397, for such sections are relatively\r\nrare. The structure is determined by a careful record of dips and\r\nstrikes. On the field map, the record may be made as shown in Figs.\r\n399 to 401, where the free ends of the lines with but one free end\r\npoint in the direction of dip, while the other lines represent the\r\ndirections of strike. Applying this method, the structure shown in\r\nFig. 400 represents a syncline, and that in Fig. 401 an anticline. In\r\ncross-section, the structure presented by Fig. 401 would appear as\r\nin Fig. 402. Fig. 403 shows a doubly plunging anticline; that is, an\r\nanticline the axis of which dips down at either end. Fig. 404 shows a\r\ncombination of synclines and anticlines, and Fig. 405 a cross-section\r\nalong the line _ab_ of Fig. 404. The outcrops of rock where the dip and\r\nstrike may be determined may be few and far between, but when they\r\nare sufficiently near one another, the structure of the rock, as shown\r\nin Fig. 405, may be worked out, even though the surface be flat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 404.—Map record of dip and strike showing complex\r\n  structure.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 405.—Cross-section of Fig. 404 along the line\r\n  _ab_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 406.—Complex folding. Section across the Alps\r\n  from the neighborhood of Zürich toward Como: about 110 miles.

(Heim.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 408.—Intimate crumpling of beds near head of\r\n  Sperry glacier, Mont. (Meyers.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 409.—Intimate crumpling in detail, accompanied by\r\n  faulting. Jasper Hill, Ishpeming, Mich. (Meyers.)]\r\n\r\nMuch the larger portion of the earth’s surface is occupied by beds that\r\nretain nearly their original horizontal attitude; but in mountainous\r\nregions the beds have usually suffered bending, folding, crumpling, and\r\ncrushing, in various degrees, in the course of the deformations that\r\ngave rise to the mountains. Distortion is on the whole most intense\r\nand characteristic in the most ancient rocks known, the Archean, in\r\nwhich a distorted condition is nearly universal, so far as observation\r\ngoes. Distortion is assigned chiefly to lateral thrust arising from\r\nthe shrinkage of the earth, as explained in the chapter on Earth\r\nMovements. The simpler, and some rather complex forms of deformation,\r\nare shown in the preceding figures, but the folding is sometimes much\r\nmore complex (Fig. 406), the folds sometimes “fan” (Fig. 407), and the\r\nbeds of which they are composed are sometimes intricately crumpled\r\n(Figs. 408 to 410). Among these various phases of deformation there are\r\nall gradations and combinations. Overturned folds reverse the order of\r\nthe strata in the under limb of the fold. After such folds have been\r\ngreatly eroded, so that their outer form is lost and their relations\r\nhave become obscure, the reversed beds are likely to be interpreted as\r\nthough they lay in natural order. In such a case as that represented in\r\nFig. 411, a complex structure may be interpreted as a simple one. Thus\r\nthe strata of Fig. 411 may have the structure shown in Fig. 412, 413,\r\nor 414, so far as dip and strike show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 410.—Plicated layers of thin-bedded chert in\r\n  limestone, etched by erosion. Lower Cambrian (?), two miles southwest\r\n  of Big Pine, Inyo Co., Cal. (Walcott, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Joints.=—The surface rocks of the earth are almost universally\r\ntraversed by deep cracks called _joints_ (Figs. 415, 138 and 140). In\r\nmost regions there are at least two systems of joints, the crevices of\r\neach system being roughly parallel to one another, while those of the\r\ntwo systems, where there are two, are approximately at right angles.\r\nIn regions of great disturbance, the number of sets of joints is often\r\nthree, four, or even more. The joints of each set may be many yards\r\napart, or in exceptional cases, but a few inches, or even a fraction of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, there are more systems of joints, and more\r\nfrequent joints in each system, where the rocks are much deformed than\r\nwhere they have been but little disturbed. In undisturbed rocks the\r\njoints approach verticality, but in regions where the rocks have been\r\nnotably deformed, the joint planes may have any position. Not rarely\r\nthey simulate bedding planes, especially in igneous and metamorphic\r\nrocks (Fig. 416). In the latter case especially, the cleavage due to\r\njointing is often mistaken for bedding. They do not ordinarily show\r\nthemselves at the surface in regions where there is much mantle rock,\r\nbut they are readily seen in the faces of cliffs, in quarries, and,\r\nin general, wherever rock is exposed (Figs. 138 and 140). Though some\r\nof them extend to greater depths than rock has ever been penetrated,\r\njoints are, after all, superficial phenomena. They must be limited to\r\nthe zone of fracture, and most of them are probably much more narrowly\r\nlimited. Joints frequently end at the plane of contact of two sorts\r\nof rock. Thus a joint extending down through limestone may end where\r\nshale is reached. Joints are frequently offset at the contact of\r\nlayers or formations, and a single joint sometimes gives place to many\r\nsmaller ones. All these phenomena are to be explained on the basis of\r\nthe different constitution and elasticity of various sorts of rock.\r\nGenerally speaking, rigid rock is more readily jointed than that which\r\nis more yielding.\r\n\r\nJoints may remain closed, or they may gap. In the latter case, they may\r\nbe widened by solution, weathering, etc., but they are quite as likely\r\nto be filled by detritus from above, or by material deposited from\r\nsolution (veins). It is along joint-planes that many rich ore-veins are\r\ndeveloped (pp. 478–484).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 411.—This diagram might represent either\r\nisoclinal or monoclinal structure. In the former case the strata might\r\nhave the structure shown in any one of the following Figures, 412 to\r\n414, so far as dip and strike show. (Dana.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 412.—A possible interpretation of Fig. 411.\r\n  (Dana.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 413.—A possible interpretation of Fig. 411.\r\n  (Dana.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 414.—A possible interpretation of Fig. 411.\r\n  (Dana.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 415.—Jointed rocks. Cayuga Lake, N. Y. (Hall.)]\r\n\r\nJoints have been referred to various causes, among which tension,\r\ntorsion,[214] earthquakes,[215] and shearing[216] are the most\r\nimportant. Most of them may probably be referred to the tension or\r\ncompression developed during crustal movements.[217] In the formation\r\nof a simple fold, for example, tension-joints parallel with the fold\r\nwill be developed, if tension goes beyond the limit of elasticity\r\nof the rock involved. If the axis of a fold is not horizontal, that\r\nis, if it “plunges,” as it commonly does, a second set of joints\r\nroughly perpendicular to the first will be developed. If the uplift be\r\ndome-shaped and sufficient to develop joints, they will radiate from\r\nthe center. It is true that joints affect regions where the rocks have\r\nnot been folded, and where they have been deformed but little, but\r\ndeformation to some extent is well-nigh universal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 416.—Jointing in granite. The surface of the rock\r\n  is a joint plane. Northwest boundary of the United States. The edges\r\n  of other joint planes normal to the surface are also shown. (Ransome,\r\n  U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 417.—Sandstone dike. Northern California.\r\n  (Diller, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nA minor cause of tension-jointing is shrinkage, due (1) to cooling, as\r\nin the development of the columnar structure of certain lavas, and (2)\r\nto dessication, as shown by the cracks developed in mud when it dries.\r\nThese causes, however, are not believed to affect rock structures to\r\nany considerable depth. Torsional joints and joints due to earthquake\r\nvibrations appear to be special phases of tension-joints.\r\n\r\nTwo or more sets of joints may also be produced by compression,\r\nthe number being dependent on the complexity of the folding. Many\r\ncompression-joints correspond in direction with planes of shearing.\r\nThey are often associated with minor faulting and with slaty cleavage.\r\n\r\nTension-joints appear to be much more widely distributed than\r\ncompression-joints.\r\n\r\n=Sandstone dikes.=—Exceptionally, open joints are filled by the\r\nintrusion of sedimentary material from beneath. Thus have arisen the\r\nremarkable sandstone dikes[218] of the West, especially of California\r\n(Fig. 417). Such dikes are sometimes several miles (nine at least) in\r\nlength. The sand of these dikes was forced up from beneath either by\r\nearthquake movements or by hydrostatic pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 418.—Diagram of a normal fault.]\r\n\r\n=Faults.=—The beds on one side of a joint-plane or fissure are\r\nsometimes elevated or depressed relative to those on the opposite side,\r\nand the displacement is known as a _fault_ (Figs. 418 and 419). The\r\njoint-planes may have any position, and hence fault-planes may vary\r\nfrom verticality to approximate horizontality. The angle by which the\r\nfault-plane departs from a vertical position is known as the _hade_\r\n(_bac_, Fig. 418). The vertical displacement (_ac_) is the _throw_ and\r\nthe horizontal displacement (_bc_) the _heave_. The heave and the throw\r\nare to be distinguished from the _displacement_, which is the amount of\r\nmovement along the fault-plane (_ab_, Fig. 418).\r\n\r\nThe cliff above the edge of the downthrow side is a _fault-scarp_. In\r\nmany, probably in most cases, the scarp has been destroyed, or at any\r\nrate greatly obscured by erosion; but occasionally fault-scarps of\r\nmountainous heights, as along the east face of the Sierras and along\r\nmany of the basin ranges of Utah, Nevada, etc., are found though much\r\nmodified by erosion (Fig. 419).\r\n\r\nFaults sometimes arise from over-intense folding (Fig. 420). A\r\ndeformation which at one point results merely in a bending of the beds,\r\nmay occasion a fault at another. Faults may pass into folds either\r\nvertically (Figs, 421 and 422) or horizontally (Fig. 423). In such\r\ncases, thickening and thinning, and stretching and shortening of the\r\nbeds is often involved (see Figs. 421 and 422). Faults are often due to\r\nthe greater settling of the beds on one side of a fissure than on the\r\nother, without special disposition to fold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 419.—A fault-scarp; the triangular faces rising\r\n  abruptly above the plain at the ends of the spurs.

Based on experimental results of Willis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 423.—Diagram showing a fault grading into a\r\n  monocline horizontally.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 424.—Slickenside surface. (Prestwich.)]\r\n\r\nThe rock on either side of a fault-plane is often smoothed as the\r\nresult of the friction of movement. Such surfaces are _slickensides_\r\n(Fig. 424). A slickenside surface has some resemblance to a glaciated\r\nsurface, but generally gives evidence of greater rigidity between the\r\nmoving surfaces.\r\n\r\nFaults are of two general classes, _normal_ and _reversed_. In the\r\nnormal fault (Fig. 418) the overhanging side is the downthrow side,\r\ni.e., the downthrow is on the side towards which the fault-plane\r\ninclines, as though the overhanging beds had slidden down the slope.\r\nNormal faults, as a rule, indicate an extension of strata, this being\r\nnecessary to permit the dissevered blocks to settle downwards. In\r\nthe reversed fault, the overhanging beds appear to have moved up\r\nthe slope of the fault-plane, as though the displacement took place\r\nunder lateral pressure. This is clearly shown to be the case where an\r\noverfold passes into a reversed fault (Fig. 420). Reversed faults are\r\nfurther illustrated by Figs. 425, 426, and 427. Where the plane of the\r\nreversed fault approaches horizontality, the fault is often called a\r\n_thrust-fault_, or an _overthrust_. In such cases the throw is to\r\nbe distinguished from the _stratigraphic throw_ (see Fig. 426). In\r\nthrust-faults, the heave is often great. The eastern face of the Rocky\r\nMountains near the boundary-line between the United States and Canada\r\nhas been pushed over the strata of the bordering plains to a distance\r\nof at least eight miles.[219] Overthrusts of like gigantic displacement\r\nhave been detected in British Columbia,[220] Scotland,[221] and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 425.—Perspective view and vertical section of a\r\n  thrust-fault. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 426.—Diagram of a thrust-fault illustrating the\r\n  several terms used in describing faults. The distinctions between\r\n  heave and displacement, and between throw and stratigraphic throw,\r\n  are to be especially noted. (Willis, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 427. —Step-fold showing (in 1) break in the\r\n  massive limestone bed which determines the plane of the break-thrust\r\n  along which the displacement shown in 2 takes place. (Willis, U. S.\r\n  Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nSometimes a fault branches (Fig. 428) and sometimes the faulting is\r\ndistributed among a series of parallel planes at short distances from\r\none another,[222] instead of being concentrated along a single plane,\r\nthus giving rise to a _distributive fault_ (Fig. 429). This is perhaps\r\nmore common in normal than in reversed faulting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 428.—Branching-fault. (Powell.)[\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 429.—Diagram showing a series of small\r\n  faults—distributive faulting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 430.—Fault in Gering series. Near Rutland Siding,\r\n  near Crawford, Neb. (Darton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\nThe amount of throw occasionally reaches several thousand feet.\r\nOccasionally faults of incredible dimensions are reported, but\r\nthese are perhaps misinterpretations. Faults are observed to die\r\nout gradually when traced horizontally, sometimes by passing into\r\nmonoclinal folds, and sometimes without connection with folding. In\r\ndepth they probably die out in similar ways in most cases. Where the\r\nthrow is great, they probably give place to folds below (Fig. 421).\r\nOther phenomena of faulting are illustrated by Figs. 430–435. A fault\r\nof thousands, or even hundreds of feet is probably the sum of numerous\r\nsmaller slippings distributed through long intervals of time. Faulting\r\nis probably one of the common causes of earthquakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 431.—Contorted and faulted laminated rock. Cook\r\n  Inlet. (Gilbert, U. S. Geol.

(Dana.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 435.—Diagram showing a fault, the plane of which\r\n  forms an open fissure and has been filled with débris from above.\r\n  (Powell.)]\r\n\r\n=The significance of faults.=[223]—Faults afford a valuable indication\r\nof the conditions of stress to which a region has been subjected, but\r\nsome caution must be exercised in their interpretation. Normal faults\r\nusually indicate an extension of the surface sufficient to permit the\r\nfault-blocks to settle down unequally. Reversed faults usually signify\r\na compression of the surface which requires the blocks to overlap\r\none another more than they did before the faulting. In other words,\r\nnormal faulting usually implies tensional stress, and reversed faulting\r\ncompressional stress. It is not difficult to see, however, that in an\r\nintensely compressed and folded region there might be cases of normal\r\nfaulting on the crests of folds where local stretching took place, and\r\nthat reversed faults might occur even in regions of tension. But such\r\ncases must usually be local, and capable of detection and elimination\r\nby a study of the phenomena of the surrounding region. These\r\nexceptional cases aside, the general inference from prevailing normal\r\nfaults is that the regions where they occur have undergone stretching,\r\nwhile the inference from the less widely distributed reversed faults is\r\nthat the surface where they occur has undergone compression.\r\n\r\nIn view of the current opinion that the crust of the earth has been\r\nsubjected to great lateral thrust as a result of cooling, it is\r\nwell to make especial note of the fact that the faults which imply\r\n_stretching_ are called _normal_ because they are the more abundant;\r\nand that the faults which imply thrust are less common, and are styled\r\n_reversed_. The numerical ratio of normal to reversed faults has never\r\nbeen closely determined, but normal faults very greatly preponderate,\r\nand are estimated by some writers to embrace 90-odd per cent. of the\r\nwhole. The testimony of normal faults is supported by the prevalence\r\nof gaping crevices, and of veins which are but crevices that stood\r\nopen until they were filled by deposition. All these phenomena seem to\r\ntestify to a _stretched_ condition of the larger part of the surface of\r\nthe continents. This will again claim attention in the study of Earth\r\nMovements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 436.—Diagram showing an area of rock with\r\n  monoclinal structure. One layer notably unlike the others.]\r\n\r\n=Effect of faulting on outcrops.=—Faulting may bring about numerous\r\ncomplications in the outcrop of rock formations. In a series of\r\nformations having a monoclinal structure (Fig. 436), many changes may\r\nbe introduced. Let it be supposed in the following cases that, after\r\nfaulting, the surface has been reduced to planeness by erosion. If\r\nthe fault-plane be parallel to the strike of the beds (_ab_, Fig.\r\n436), and hence a _strike fault_, the outcrop of a given layer may be\r\nduplicated (_H_, Fig. 437), or it may be eliminated altogether (Fig.\r\n438). If the fault-plane be parallel to the direction of dip (_cd_,\r\nFig. 436), a _dip fault_, the layer _H_ will outcrop, as in Fig.\r\n439, if the downthrow was on the far side, or as in Fig. 440 if the\r\ndownthrow was on the opposite side. In both cases the outcrop _H_ is\r\n_offset_, the amount of the offset decreasing with increasing angle of\r\ndip and increasing with increasing throw of the fault. If the fault\r\nbe oblique to the direction of dip and strike (_ef_, Fig. 436), an\r\n_oblique fault_, the outcrop of such a layer as _H_ will have the\r\nrelations shown in Fig. 441 if the downthrow was to the left, and that\r\nshown in Fig. 442 if the downthrow was to the right. In the former\r\ncase, it is said that there is _offset with overlap_; in the latter,\r\n_offset with gap_. The amount of the overlap and gap, respectively,\r\nincreases with the increase of throw and hade, and decreases with\r\nincrease of dip. In all cases the outcrop (after the degradation of the\r\nupthrow side) is shifted down dip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 437.—Same as Fig. 436, after (1) displacement by\r\n  a strike fault and (2) base-leveling. The outcrops of certain beds\r\n  are repeated.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 438.—Diagram illustrating how a strike fault in\r\n  such a structure as that shown in Fig. 436 may cause the outcrop of\r\n  certain beds to disappear.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 439.—Diagram illustrating how a dip fault in the\r\n  structure shown in Fig. 436 affects the outcrop when the downthrow\r\n  was on the farther side of the fault-plane.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 440.—Same as Fig. 439, except that the downthrow\r\n  was on the opposite side.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 441.—Oblique fault in the structure shown in Fig.\r\n  436. The downthrow was on the left side. The outcrop of layer _H_ is\r\n  offset with _overlap_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 442.—Same as Fig. 441, except that the downthrow\r\n  was on the right side, and the offset is with a _gap_ instead of an\r\n  overlap.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 443.—Diagram showing effect of faulting on the\r\n  outcrops of synclinal beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 444.—Diagram showing effect of faulting on\r\n  outcrops of anticlinal beds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 445.—Diagram illustrating the effect of\r\n  diminishing throw on outcrops in regions of folded rocks.]\r\n\r\nIf a fault crosses folds at right angles to their axes, the effect is\r\nto change the distance between the outcrops of a given bed on opposite\r\nsides of the fault, after the truncation of the folded beds. The\r\ndistance is decreased on the upthrow side of a syncline (Fig. 443) and\r\nincreased on the upthrow side of an anticline (Fig. 444). If the throw\r\nof a fault in tilted beds diminishes in one direction, it may cause\r\nbeds to outcrop, as shown in Fig. 445. Various other complications\r\narise under other circumstances. Since faults rarely show themselves in\r\nthe topography of the surface, except under special circumstances (see\r\np. 151), their detection and measurement is usually based on the study\r\nof the relations of the beds involved, as illustrated by Figs. 436–445.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n          THE MOVEMENTS AND DEFORMATIONS OF THE EARTH’S BODY\r\n                            (DIASTROPHISM).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body of the earth is subject to an infinite variety of movements,\r\nranging from the almost inconceivably rapid to the almost imperceptibly\r\nslow, and from the almost immeasurably minute to the enormously\r\nmassive; but, for practical treatment, they fall mainly into two\r\ncouplets: (1) the minute and rapid, and (2) the slow and massive.\r\nSudden movements of local masses, giving rise to intense vibrations,\r\nare put in the first class. There are innumerable minute and slow\r\nmovements, but unless they rise to appreciable magnitude by long\r\ncontinuance, they are neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MINUTE AND RAPID MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth is in a state of perpetual tremor. For the\r\nmost part, these tremors are too minute to be sensible, but are\r\nrevealed by delicate instrumental devices. Some of them are but the\r\ndeclining stages of sensible vibrations, but others are minute from\r\ntheir inception. Many of them spring from the ordinary incidents of\r\nthe surface, and claim attention chiefly as obstacles to the study of\r\nmore significant oscillations. Winds, waves, waterfalls, the tread of\r\nanimals, the rumble of traffic, the blasts of mines, the changes of\r\ntemperature, the variations in atmospheric pressure, the weighting of\r\nrainfall and the lightening of evaporation, the rupture of rock or ice\r\nor frozen earth, and many other processes, make their contributions\r\nto local and minute movements. For the greater part, these vibrations\r\nare superficial in origin, and are soon damped beyond recognition by\r\ndispersal and by the inelastic and discontinuous nature of the looser\r\nmaterial of the surface. When a temporary rigid crust is formed by\r\nfreezing, as in winter, these surface vibrations are transmitted with\r\nmuch less loss, and the distances at which the rumble of winter traffic\r\nis heard, is a good illustration of the function of continuity and\r\nsolidity in the conveyance of vibrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Earthquakes._\r\n\r\nWhen the tremors spring from sources within the earth itself and are of\r\nappreciable violence, they are recognized as earthquakes. The sources\r\nof earthquake tremors are various. The most prevalent is probably the\r\nfracture of rocks and the slipping of strata on each other in the\r\nprocess of faulting. The interpretation of movements of this class\r\nhas now been so far perfected that the length and depth of the fault,\r\nthe amount of the slip, and the direction of the hade are capable of\r\napproximate estimation.[224] To the same class belong the movements\r\ndue to slumping. They are illustrated by the sliding and arrest of\r\ngreat masses of sediment along the steep fronts of deltas, and of\r\nthe accumulations of deep-sea oozes on steep submarine slopes. Such\r\nslumping is, in reality, superficial faulting. Seismic tremors often\r\nattend volcanic eruptions, and are then probably attributable to the\r\nsudden fracture and displacement of rock by the penetration of lava,\r\nor by rapid and unequal heating. They are perhaps also due sometimes\r\nto the sudden generation or cooling of steam in underground conduits,\r\ncrevices, and caverns, the action possibly being in some cases of the\r\n“water-hammer” type. In rare instances, probably, the bursting of beds\r\noverlying pent-up non-volcanic gases may give origin to earthquakes. A\r\nmore superficial source of earthquake vibrations is the collapse of the\r\nroofs of subterranean caverns.\r\n\r\nSeismic vibrations seem to be in part compressional, in part\r\ndistortional, in part (on the surface) undulatory, and in part\r\nirregular. The distortional are especially significant, as they seem to\r\nimply a solid medium of transmission.\r\n\r\n=Points of origin, foci.=—It is probable that nearly or quite all\r\nearthquake movements start within the upper ten miles of the crust,\r\nand most of them within the upper five. Some of the earlier estimates\r\nindeed placed the points of origin as deep as 20 or 30 miles, but in\r\nthese cases the necessary corrections, discussed below, were neglected.\r\nMost of the recent and more accurate estimates fall within the limits\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe method of estimating the depth of the centers of disturbance\r\nconsists in observing the directions of throw or thrust of bodies\r\nat the surface, and in regarding these as representing the lines\r\nof emergence of the earthquake-waves. By plotting these lines of\r\nemergence, and projecting them backwards to their underground\r\ncrossings, a first approximation to the location of the focus is\r\nreached (the lines _EF′_, Fig. 446). From the nature of the case, the\r\nobservations of the angles of emergence cannot be very accurate, but an\r\neffort is made to limit the error by making the number of observations\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nTwo systematic corrections are to be applied to all such estimates,\r\nthe one for varying elasticity and density, and the other for\r\nvarying continuity. Both reduce the estimated depth. In making the\r\ncorrection for varying elasticity, it must be noted that the velocity\r\nof vibrations varies directly as the square root of the elasticity,\r\nand inversely as the square root of the density. The velocity is also\r\naccelerated by increase of temperature. The elasticity, temperature,\r\nand density all increase with depth. Theoretically, the increase of\r\nvelocity due to the increasing elasticity and temperature of increasing\r\ndepths, overbalances the retardation due to increasing density, and\r\nrecent observations on the transmission of seismic waves through deep\r\nchords of the earth have confirmed this conclusion. The path of the\r\nvibration will, therefore, be curved toward the surface, as pointed out\r\nby Schmidt and illustrated in Fig. 446, taken from his discussion.[225]\r\nFrom this it is clear that the focus is not so deep as implied by the\r\nsimple backward projection of the lines of emergence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 446.—Diagram illustrating by closed curves the\r\n  different rates of propagation of seismic tremors from a focus _F_,\r\n  and, by lines normal to these, the changing directions of propagation\r\n  of the wave-front. It will be seen that the paths of propagation\r\n  curve upwards in approaching the surface. If the lines of emergence,\r\n  as at _E_ and _E_, be projected backwards, as to _F′_, the points of\r\n  crossing will be below the true focus.]\r\n\r\nA second correction must be made for the differences of continuity\r\nof the upper rock in the vertical and horizontal directions. In the\r\nouter part of the earth, the continuity in horizontal directions is\r\ninterrupted by vertical fissures. Were these not usually filled with\r\nwater, they would soon kill the horizontal component of the seismic\r\nwave, and the residual portion would be directed almost vertically to\r\nthe surface, for the width of the fissures is almost always greater\r\nthan the amplitude of the seismic vibrations. The water restores the\r\ncontinuity, in a measure, but not perfectly, for the elasticity of\r\nwater is much less than that of rock. It is clear that in horizontal\r\nmovement there must be a constant transfer from rock to water and from\r\nwater to rock, and this must retard, as well as partially destroy, the\r\nvibrations. In a vertical direction, however, the rocks rest firmly\r\nupon one another, and this gives measurable continuity, the only change\r\nbeing from one layer or kind of rock to another. It seems certain,\r\ntherefore, that the vertical component of the seismic wave will be less\r\ndamped and less retarded in transmission than the horizontal. It will,\r\ntherefore, reach the surface sooner and will have the greater effect on\r\nbodies at the surface, not only for the reasons given, but also because\r\nit emerges more nearly in the line of least resistance and of freest\r\nprojection. On this account, a second correction must be added to the\r\ncorrection for elasticity, and this must further reduce appreciably the\r\nfirst estimate of the depth of the focus.\r\n\r\nObservation shows that in some way a seismic wave becomes separated in\r\ntransmission into portions of different natures and speeds, but their\r\ninterpretation is yet uncertain. These separated portions probably\r\nconsist of the compressional, the distortional, and the undulatory\r\nwaves, and perhaps of refractions and reflections of these (see Fig.\r\n448).\r\n\r\nA most important recent achievement is the detection and investigation\r\nof seismic tremors that appear to have come _through_ the earth. The\r\ntransmission of such waves promises to reveal much relative to the\r\nnature of the deep interior, when enough data are gathered to warrant\r\nconclusions. The rate of propagation in the central parts is found to\r\nbe greater than in the outer parts, implying high elasticity within.\r\n\r\n=The amplitude of the vibrations.=—From the very disastrous effects\r\nof severe earthquakes, it is natural to infer that the distinctive\r\noscillations must have large amplitude, but in fact it is the\r\nsuddenness of the vibration, rather than its length, that is\r\neffective. Instrumental investigations indicate that the oscillations,\r\nafter they have left their points of origin, are usually only a\r\nfraction of a millimeter in amplitude; at most they seldom exceed a few\r\nmillimeters. A sudden shock with an amplitude of 5 or 6 millimeters is\r\nsufficient to shatter a chimney. It is true that estimates assigning\r\namplitudes of a foot or more have been made, but their correctness is\r\nopen to serious doubt. It should be understood that it is the length\r\nof oscillation of the particles of the subsurface rock transmitting\r\nthe vibrations that is referred to, not the movement of the free\r\nsurface, or of objects on the surface. The throw at and on the surface\r\nis much greater. Just as a slight, quick tap of a hammer on a floor\r\nis sufficient to make a marble lying on it bound several inches, so\r\na sufficiently sudden rise of the surface of the earth, though but a\r\nfraction of an inch, may project loose bodies many feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 447.—Illustration of the destructive effects of\r\n  the Charleston earthquake, showing definite direction of throw. (W.\r\n  J. McGee.)]\r\n\r\n=Destructive effects.=—The interpretation of the disastrous results\r\nof earthquake shocks has, therefore, its key in the suddenness and\r\nstrength of rather minute vibrations of the earth-matter, but it is\r\nalso dependent on the freedom of motion of the bodies affected. The\r\nrocks of the deeper zones, where the matter is sensibly continuous,\r\ntransmit the seismic vibrations without appreciable disruptive effect,\r\nso far as known, though the origin of crevices has been assigned to\r\nthis cause; but bodies at the surface are fractured, overturned, and\r\nhurled from their places. The reason is doubtless this: Within a great\r\nmass firmly held in place by cohesion and pressure on all sides, the\r\nforward motion of a particle develops an equal elastic resistance,\r\nand it is quickly thrown back again and the wave passes on. At the\r\nsurface, where bodies are freer to move, the stroke of the vibration\r\nprojects the body, and so, instead of vibratory resilience, the chief\r\nenergy is converted into mass-motion. The tap of a hammer sends an\r\nalmost imperceptible vibration along the floor, but this vibration may\r\nthrow a glass ball, beneath which it runs, into the air. So the minute\r\nvibrations of earth-matter may travel miles from their origin through\r\ncontinuous substance with little result, and then so suddenly thrust a\r\nloose body on the surface, or the base of a column, or the foundation\r\nof a house, as to rack it with differential strains, or even to hurl\r\nit to destruction. So, too, earth-waves striking the sea-border may\r\nthrust the waters off shore by their sudden impact, and the reaction\r\nmay develop a wave which overwhelms the coast. Such waves may doubtless\r\narise from a sudden stroke of seismic vibrations on the sea-bottom.\r\nThe great gaping fissures that sometimes open during earthquakes occur\r\noftenest where the surface on one side is less well supported than on\r\nthe other, as on a slope, or near a bluff-face or a river-channel. When\r\nin such situations the earth is once suddenly forced in the direction\r\nof least resistance, it is not always met by sufficient elastic\r\nresistance to throw it back. Sometimes, however, there is an elastic\r\nreturn, and the fissure closes forcibly an instant after it is opened.\r\n\r\n=Direction of throw.=—Immediately above the point of origin,\r\ntechnically the _epicentrum_ or _epi-focal point_, bodies are projected\r\nupwards. When crushing takes place in such a case, it is due to the\r\nupthrust or to the return downfall. At one side of the epicentrum the\r\nthrust is oblique in various degrees, and is usually more destructive,\r\nif not too far from the epicentrum. The destructiveness commonly\r\nincreases for a certain distance from the epi-focal point, and then\r\ndiminishes. Under ideal conditions, the greatest effects are found\r\nwhere the vibration emerges at an angle of about 45°, but various\r\ninfluences modify this result. Lines drawn through points of equal\r\neffect (isoseismals) are not usually regular circles or ellipses about\r\nthe epicentrum, as they would be under ideal conditions. The various\r\ndivergencies represent differences of effective elasticity, of surface,\r\nand of other influences. As most earthquakes originate from lines,\r\nplanes, or masses, rather than points, there are doubtless differences\r\nof intensity of vibration at different points on the lines, planes,\r\nor areas of origin, and these differences introduce inequalities in\r\npropagation and in surface effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 448.—Illustrations of the records made by\r\n  earthquake tremors after distant transmission through the earth. The\r\n  four diagrams represent the same set of tremors as received at Shide,\r\n  Kew, Bidston, and Edinburgh in Great Britain. The movement was from\r\n  left to right. (Milne.)]\r\n\r\n=Rate of propagation.=—The progress of a seismic wave varies very\r\ngreatly. Both experimental tests and natural observations give very\r\ndiscordant results. At present, they justify only the broad statement\r\nthat the velocity of propagation varies from several hundreds to\r\nseveral thousands of feet per second at the surface. The rate seems to\r\nbe greater for strong vibrations than for weak ones, and hence it is\r\nfaster near the origin than farther away. The strength of a vibration\r\ndies away, theoretically, according to the inverse square of the\r\ndistance from the point of origin. Practically there is to be added to\r\nthis the partial destruction of the vibrations by conversion into other\r\nforms of motion.\r\n\r\n=Sequences of vibrations.=—Near the source, the main shocks are apt to\r\ncome suddenly and to be followed by minor tremors. At a distance there\r\nare usually “preliminary” vibrations followed by the main tremors,\r\nand these by others of gradually diminishing value. This development\r\nis assigned to different rates of propagation, and to refractions and\r\nreflections not unlike the prolongation of thunder (see Fig. 448).\r\nThis deployment of the vibrations is notably developed in the shocks\r\nthat pass long distances through the earth. The vibrations of the\r\nfirst phase are regarded as compressional, those of the second as\r\ndistortional, while the largest oscillations which arise still later\r\nperhaps come around the surface, and may be undulatory, though their\r\nnature is not yet determined.\r\n\r\nThere is often, however, a true succession of original shocks caused by\r\na succession of slips or ruptures at the source. Sometimes these are\r\nexceedingly persistent, running through days, weeks, or even months. In\r\nsuch cases a slow faulting is probably in progress, and little slips\r\nand stops follow in close succession. In one instance as many as 600\r\nshocks in ten days have been reported.[226]\r\n\r\n=Gaseous emanations.=—Vapors and gas frequently issue from earthquake\r\nrents, and are popularly made to serve as causes, but they are usually\r\nmerely the earth gases that are permitted to escape by the rending\r\nof the ground, or are forced out by readjustment of the shaken beds.\r\nLike other subterranean gases, they are often sulphurous, and they are\r\nsometimes hot, especially in volcanic regions. Where the shocks are\r\nconnected with eruptions, the gases may be truly volcanic.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of earthquakes.=—Over large portions of the globe,\r\nsevere earthquakes are exceedingly rare, but in certain regions they\r\nare unfortunately frequent. For the most part, these are volcanic\r\ndistricts, but this is by no means a universal relation. Earthquakes\r\nand volcanoes are only in part associates. In general, it may be said\r\nthat earthquakes are frequent where geologic changes are in rapid\r\nprogress, as along belts of young mountains, where the stresses are\r\nnot yet adjusted, or at the mouths of great streams, where deltas are\r\naccumulating, or about volcanoes, where temperatures and strains are\r\nchanging, or on the great slopes, particularly the submarine slopes,\r\nwhere readjustments in response to inequalities of surface stress are\r\nin progress. Not a few, however, occur where the special occasion is\r\nnot at all obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Geologic Effects of Earthquakes._\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are of much less importance, geologically, than many\r\ngentler movements and activities. Disastrous as they sometimes are to\r\nhuman affairs, they leave few distinct and readily identifiable marks\r\nwhich are more than temporary.\r\n\r\n=Fracturing of rock.=—During the passage of notable earthquake waves,\r\nthe solid rock is probably often fractured (see p. 509), though where\r\nit is covered by deep soil the fractures are rarely observable at the\r\nsurface. Elsewhere the crevices are readily seen, especially if they\r\ngape. In a few instances surface-rock has been seen to be thoroughly\r\nshattered after the passage of an earthquake, as in the Concepcion\r\nearthquake of 1835.[227] Joints which were before closed are often\r\nopened during an earthquake. Thus in northern Arizona, not far from\r\nCanyon Diablo, there is a crevice traceable for a considerable\r\ndistance, which is said to have been opened during an earthquake.\r\nLocally, it gaps several feet. Other notable earthquake fissures\r\nhave been recorded in India,[228] Japan, and New Zealand. During an\r\nearthquake which shook the South Island of New Zealand in 1848, “a\r\nfissure was formed averaging 18 inches in width, and traceable for a\r\ndistance of 60 miles, parallel to the axis of the adjacent mountain\r\nchain.”[229] The development of fractures or the opening of joints is\r\nsometimes accompanied by faulting. This was the case in Japan during\r\nthe earthquake of October 28, 1891, when the surface on one side of a\r\nfissure, which could be traced for 40 miles, sank 2 to 20 feet. In this\r\ncase there was also notable horizontal displacement, the east wall of\r\nthe fissure being thrust locally as much as 13 feet to the north.[230]\r\n\r\n=Changes of surface.=—Circular surface openings or basins are sometimes\r\ndeveloped during earthquakes. This was the case during the Charleston\r\nearthquake of 1886,[231] and similar effects have been noted elsewhere.\r\nThese openings often serve as avenues of escape for ground-water,\r\ngases, and vapor. They are commonly supposed to be the result of the\r\ncollapse of caverns, or other subterranean openings, the collapse often\r\ncausing the forcible ejection of water. Such openings are likely to be\r\nformed only where the surface material is incoherent. Sandstone dikes\r\n(p. 514) may perhaps be associated in origin with earthquakes.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are likely to dislodge masses of rock in unstable\r\npositions, as on slopes or cliffs. They may also occasion slumps and\r\nlandslides.[232]\r\n\r\n=Effects on drainage.=—The fracturing of the rock may interfere with\r\nthe movement of ground-water. After new cracks are developed, or old\r\nones opened or closed, the movement of ground-water adapts itself\r\nto the new conditions. It follows that springs sometimes cease to\r\nflow after an earthquake, while new ones break out where there had\r\nbeen none before. The character of the water of springs is sometimes\r\nchanged, presumably because it comes from different sources after the\r\nearthquake. Joints may be so widened as to intercept rivulets, and\r\nthe waters thus intercepted may cause the further enlargement of the\r\nopening. Illustrations of this sort are furnished by the earthquakes\r\nof the Mississippi valley (Lat. 36° to 38°) in 1811–12. Where faults\r\naccompany earthquakes, they occasion ponds or falls where they cross\r\nstreams. Illustrations of both were furnished by the Chedrang River of\r\nIndia after the earthquake of 1897.[233]\r\n\r\n=Effects on standing water.=—Some of the most destructive effects of\r\nearthquakes are felt along the borders of the sea. Thus the great\r\nsea-wave of the Lisbon earthquake (1755) and that of the earthquake\r\nwhich affected the coasts of Ecuador and Peru in 1868 are examples.\r\nSuch waves have been known to advance on the land as walls of water 60\r\nfeet in height. They are most destructive along low coasts, for here\r\nthe water may sweep much more extensively over the land. The great\r\nloss of life during an earthquake has usually been the direct result\r\nof the great waves. Lakes are also affected by earthquakes, their\r\nwaters sometimes rising and falling for several hours after the initial\r\ndisturbance, but lake-waves are much feebler than those of the sea, and\r\nare not often destructive.\r\n\r\nEarthquake shocks are sometimes remarkably destructive to the life\r\nof lakes and seas. Thus during the Indian earthquake of 1897, “fishes\r\nwere killed in myriads as by the explosion of a dynamite cartridge ...\r\nand for days after the earthquake, the river (Sumesari) was choked\r\nwith thousands of dead fish ... and two floating carcasses of Gangetic\r\ndolphins were seen which had been killed by the shock.”[234] This\r\nwholesale destruction of life is of interest, since the surfaces of\r\nlayers of rock, often of great age, are sometimes covered with fossils\r\nof fish or other animal forms, so numerous and so preserved as to\r\nindicate that the animals were killed suddenly and in great numbers,\r\nand their bodies quickly buried. It has been suggested that such rock\r\nsurfaces may be memorials of ancient earthquake shocks.[235]\r\n\r\n=Changes of level.=—Permanent changes of level sometimes accompany an\r\nearthquake. Thus after the earthquake of 1822 “the coast of Chili for a\r\nlong distance was said to have risen 3 or 4 feet.”[236] Similar results\r\nhave occurred on the same coast at other times, and on other coasts at\r\nvarious times. Depression of the surface is perhaps even more common\r\nthan elevation. Thus on the coast of India all except the higher parts\r\nof an area 60 square miles in extent were sunk below the sea during\r\nan earthquake in 1762. Widespread depression in the vicinity of the\r\nMississippi in Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee accompanied\r\nthe earthquakes of 1811 and 1812. Some of the depressed areas were\r\nconverted into marshes, while others became the sites of permanent\r\nlakes. Reelfoot Lake, mainly in Tennessee, is an example. Change of\r\nlevel is involved wherever there is faulting, and faulting is probably\r\nrather common in connection with earthquakes.\r\n\r\nChanges of level are not confined to the land. Where earthquake\r\ndisturbances affect the sea-bottom in regions of telegraph cables, the\r\ncables are often broken. In such cases notable changes have sometimes\r\nbeen discovered and recorded when the cables were repaired. Striking\r\nexamples are furnished by the region about Greece.[237] In one instance\r\n(1873) the repairing vessel found about 2000 feet of water where about\r\n1400 feet existed when the cable was laid. In another instance (1878)\r\nthe bottom was “so irregular and uneven for a distance of about two\r\nmiles, that a detour was made and the cable lengthened by five or\r\nsix miles.” In still another case (1885) the repairing vessel found a\r\n“difference of 1500 feet between the bow and stern soundings.” These\r\nrecords point to sea-bottom faulting on a large scale.\r\n\r\nIt is probably no nearer the truth to say that changes of level result\r\nfrom earthquakes than to say that earthquakes result from changes of\r\nlevel. The two classes of phenomena are probably to be referred to a\r\ncommon cause.[238]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SLOW MASSIVE MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from the intense and inconceivably rapid oscillations\r\nof the earthquake, to the excessively slow subsidences of continents,\r\nor even the slow wrinkling of mountain folds. Not infrequently rivers\r\nwear down their channels across a mountain range as fast as it rises\r\nathwart them. The movements of continents are even more deliberate.\r\nBut, far apart as these contrasted movements are, in rate and method,\r\nthey are associated in ultimate causation, and the earthquake shock is\r\noften merely an incident in the formation of a mountain range or in the\r\nsubsidence of a continent.\r\n\r\nThe great movements are usually classed (1) as continent-making\r\n(epeirogenic) and (2) mountain-making (orogenic). They may also be\r\nclassed as (1) vertical movements and (2) horizontal movements, and\r\ndynamically, as (1) thrust movements and (2) stretching movements.\r\nIt is to be understood that these distinctions are little more than\r\nanalytical conveniences, for continental movements are often at the\r\nsame time mountain-making movements; vertical movements are usually\r\ninvolved in horizontal movements, and stretching usually takes part in\r\nthe processes in which thrust predominates, and _vice versa_. But where\r\none phase greatly preponderates, it may conveniently give name to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n=Present movements.=—Critical observations on seacoasts show that\r\nsome shores are slowly rising and some slowly sinking _relative to\r\nthe ocean-level_. We do not certainly know what their movements are\r\nrelative to the center of the earth; very possibly all may be sinking,\r\none set faster than the other, the ocean-surface also going down at an\r\nintermediate rate. Theoretically, all might possibly be rising, one\r\nset faster than the other, the ocean also rising at an intermediate\r\nrate, though this is extremely improbable. One set may be actually\r\nrising relative to the center of the earth, and the other sinking,\r\nwhile the ocean-level is stationary, or nearly so. This is the way in\r\nwhich we are accustomed to interpret them. A general shrinkage of the\r\nearth, however, is probably going on, carrying down land-surface and\r\nsea-surface. It has been urged by Suess[239] that the general shrinkage\r\nis so great that the local upward warpings and foldings never equal\r\nit, and that the real movements are all downward, though in different\r\ndegrees. This is probably the general fact at least. Over against this\r\nis the popular disposition to regard earth movements generally as\r\n“upheavals.” There is also a predilection for regarding the rigid land\r\nas moving and the mobile sea-level as fixed. In reality, the sea is an\r\nextremely adaptive body that settles into the irregular hollows of the\r\nlithosphere, and is shifted about with every warping of the latter.\r\nWhatever change affects the capacity of its depressions affects also\r\nthe sea-level. If they are increased, the sea settles more deeply into\r\nthem; if they are decreased, the sea spreads out more widely on the\r\nborders of the land. The one thing that gives a measure of stability\r\nto the sea-level is the fact that all the great basins are connected,\r\nand so an _average_ is maintained. A warping down in one part of the\r\nsea-bottom may be offset by an upward warping somewhere else in the\r\n72% of the earth’s surface covered by the ocean, and so it is only the\r\n_sum total of all changes_ in the sea-bottoms and borders that effects\r\nthe common level. Thus it happens that, notwithstanding its instability\r\nand its complete subordination to the lithosphere, the sea-level is\r\nthe most convenient basis of reference, and has become the accepted\r\ndatum-plane. If there were some available mode of measuring the\r\ndistance of points from the center of the earth, it would give absolute\r\ndata and absolute terms, and would reveal much that is now uncertain\r\nrespecting the real movements of the surface. For convenience, however,\r\nsince absolute terms are impracticable, the ordinary language of\r\ngeology, which represents movements as upward and downward, according\r\nto their relations to the sea-level or to the average surface, will be\r\nemployed. Notwithstanding this concession to convenience in the use\r\nof terms, it is of the greatest importance to form, and to constantly\r\nretain, true fundamental views.\r\n\r\n=Fundamental conceptions.=—The existence of any land at all is\r\ndependent on the inequalities of the surface and of the density of the\r\nlithosphere, for if it were perfectly spheroidal and equidense, the\r\nhydrosphere would cover it completely to a depth of about two miles.\r\nNot only are inequalities necessary to the existence of land, but these\r\ninequalities must be _renewed from time to time_, or the land area\r\nwould soon, geologically speaking, be covered by the sea. The renewal\r\nhas been made again and again in geological history by movements that\r\nhave increased the inequalities in the surface of the lithosphere.\r\nWith each such movement, apparently, the oceans have withdrawn more\r\ncompletely within the basins, and the continents have stood forth more\r\nbroadly and relatively higher, until again worn down. This renewal of\r\ninequalities appears to have been, in its great features, a _periodic\r\nmovement_, recurring at long intervals. In the intervening times,\r\nthe sea has crept out over the lower parts of the continents, moving\r\non steadily and slowly toward their complete submersion, which would\r\ninevitably have been attained if no interruption had checked and\r\nreversed the process. These are the great movements of the earth, and\r\nin them lies, we believe, the soul of geologic history and the basis\r\nfor its grand divisions. The reasons for this will appear as the\r\nhistory is followed, and its most potential agencies are seen unfolding\r\nthemselves. At the same time, there have been numerous minor surface\r\nmovements in almost constant progress. While these two classes of\r\nmovements have been associated, and are perhaps due in the main to the\r\nsame causes, they are sufficiently different in some of their dynamic\r\naspects to be separated in treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Nearly Constant Small Movements._\r\n\r\nInnumerable gentle warpings have affected nearly every portion of the\r\nsurface of the globe at nearly all stages of its history. Not only\r\nduring the periods of great movements were there countless minor and\r\ngentler movements, but at times of relative quiescence there were\r\nslow swellings and saggings of the surface of the lithosphere. They\r\nsometimes affected small areas and sometimes large ones, and they\r\nwere sometimes of upward phase and sometimes of downward. They were\r\nthe immediate agencies in locating and controlling the deposition\r\nof stratified rocks, though they rest back on the great movements\r\nfor their working conditions. Very slow sinkings of sea-borders have\r\npermitted deposition to go on in shallow water for long periods\r\nwithout being interrupted by the local filling of the sea. Very slow\r\nswellings of land tracts, relative or absolute, have permitted erosion\r\nto supply material for such sedimentation for long periods without\r\nexhausting the sources. Very slow upward warpings in one region and\r\ndownward warpings in another have shifted the borders of the land\r\nand sea, and with them the areas of erosion and deposition. Thus\r\nhave arisen overlaps and unconformities of strata and diversities\r\nin their distribution from stage to stage. Such movements may have\r\namounted to a few inches, or a few feet, or a few fathoms per century.\r\nDownward movements have sometimes affected a considerable section of a\r\ncontinent, letting in a shallow _epicontinental_ sea upon it, such, for\r\nexample, as the North Sea upon the northwestern border of the continent\r\nof Europe, and Hudson Bay upon the northeastern part of North America.\r\nSimilar movements seem to have extended the seas even more widely\r\nupon the surface of the land in times past, as attested by the great\r\ntransgressions of the ocean-borders and the great epicontinental spread\r\nof strata. Notwithstanding their great breadths, the epicontinental\r\nseas were generally shallow. Similar gentle warpings of upward phase\r\nrescued the bottoms of shallow seas from submersion, and inaugurated\r\nerosion; or they bowed base-leveled lands upward, and rejuvenated\r\ntheir streams and inaugurated a new cycle of denudation. Often they\r\nconnected continents previously separated by shallow straits, and thus\r\ninaugurated inter-continental migrations of land life, while they\r\nstopped inter-oceanic migration.\r\n\r\nThe gentleness and frequency of these movements is attested by the\r\ncharacter of the sediments and by their relations to one another, as\r\nwill be seen in the study of the sedimentary series.\r\n\r\n=Reciprocal features.=—These minor warpings show a notable tendency\r\nto be reciprocal. If one area is bowed up, another near by is bowed\r\ndown. If the continents settle, the oceans rise on their borders. If\r\nthe land is cut down, the sea is filled up. There is an important\r\nphase of this deserving especial note. Certain tracts have been slowly\r\nbowed upwards into long land swells, the streams being rejuvenated and\r\ndegradation hastened. Adjacent tracts have been slowly bowed downwards\r\ninto long parallel troughs which received the wash from the adjacent\r\nswells, and thus became tracts of exceptional sedimentation. Such a\r\ntract of parallel swell and sag, if our interpretation be correct,\r\ndeveloped along the Atlantic border of North America in the Paleozoic\r\nera. By the slow upward warping of the swells, the feeding-grounds of\r\nthe streams were maintained, and the sags were filled about as fast\r\nas they sank. Thus a great depth of sediment was laid down in the\r\ncourse of an era measured by millions of years. So in other regions,\r\nespecially near the borders of the continents, there have been similar\r\nreciprocal movements, giving at once feeding-grounds for the streams\r\nand lodgment-grounds for the sediments, side by side in parallel\r\nbelts. It is a common view that these belts of deep sedimentation were\r\nthe forerunners of mountain formation, and that they determined the\r\nformation of the mountains. In view of the grounds for doubting the\r\nefficiency of so superficial an agency in mountain formation, which\r\nwill appear as we go on, it may be well to hold this view in abeyance,\r\nand to dwell on the reciprocal nature of the action, in which the\r\nupward bowing that gave the feeding-grounds is as vital a factor as\r\nthe sagging that accommodated the sedimentation. It is important to\r\nrecognize that in so far as the crust was weak enough to yield to\r\nthese gentler forces, it was not strong enough to accumulate the great\r\nstresses necessary to form mountain ranges, and further, that in so far\r\nas the stresses were eased by the gentle warping, they could not be\r\naccumulated for the later work of mountain-folding. It is nevertheless\r\nprobable that the conditions which located the gentle swelling and\r\nsagging also located the mountain-folding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The Great Periodic Movements._\r\n\r\n=Mountain-forming movements.=—Along certain tracts, usually near the\r\nborders of the continents, and at certain times, usually separated by\r\nlong intervals, the crust was folded into gigantic wrinkles, and these\r\nconstitute the chief type of mountains, though not the only type. The\r\ncharacteristic force in this folding was lateral thrust. The strata\r\nwere not only arched, but often closely folded, and sometimes intensely\r\ncrumpled. In extreme cases, like the Alps, the folds flared out above,\r\ngiving overturn dips and reversed strata, as illustrated in the chapter\r\non Structural Geology, pp. 501–511. In these cases there was an upward\r\nas well as a horizontal movement, for the folds themselves were\r\nlifted; but the horizontal thrust so much preponderated, and was so\r\nmuch the more remarkable, that the upward movement was overshadowed.\r\nIt is well to note, however, that these mountain ranges are crumpled\r\n_outward_ and not _inward_, as might be expected if they resulted\r\nsimply from the shrinkage of the under side of a thin shell. The folds\r\nare sometimes nearly upright and symmetrical, and sometimes inclined\r\nand asymmetrical, as illustrated in the chapter referred to. Where the\r\nfolds lean, the inference has been drawn that the active thrust came\r\nfrom the side of the gentler slope, the folds being pushed over toward\r\nthe resisting side, and this seems to be commonly true. The original\r\nattitude of the beds, however, has much to do with the character of\r\nthe folds.[240] By a slight change in the mode of thrust, sheets of\r\npaper may be so pushed as to lean forward or backward at pleasure.\r\nThe leaning of the folds seems, therefore, a doubtful criterion for\r\ndetermining the direction of the active movement. Mountains of the\r\nthrust type usually consist of a series of folds nearly parallel to\r\neach other, the whole forming an anticlinorium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 449.—The great Eurasian mountain tract. Jones\r\n  Relief Globe. (Photo. by R. T. Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\n=Distribution of folded ranges.=—The prevailing location of this\r\nclass of mountains is so generally near the borders of the continents\r\nthat the relation is probably significant. Dana[241] long ago called\r\nattention to the fact that the greatest mountain ranges stand opposite\r\nthe greatest ocean-basins, and he connected the elevation of the one\r\nwith the depression of the other. One of the most notable exceptions\r\nto this relation is the complex system of southern Europe, from the\r\nPyrenees to the Caucasus, and another is the Altai and connected ranges\r\n(Fig. 449). The Urals and not a few minor ranges are also exceptions.\r\nIt is probably better to regard the crumpled tracts as lying on the\r\nborders of great segments of the earth that acted essentially as units,\r\nand to regard the relationship to the sea as a coincidence that is only\r\nin part causal.[242]\r\n\r\n=Plateau-forming movements.=—Another leading phase of crustal movement\r\nis the settling or rising of great blocks of the crust, as though by\r\nvertical rather than horizontal force. The western plateau of North\r\nAmerica and the great plateau of Thibet are gigantic examples. The\r\nAmerican plateau embraces numerous blocks which, while they have been\r\nelevated together, are individually tilted in their own fashion. At\r\nthe surface, they are separated by fault-planes, but below, some of\r\nthem, and perhaps most of them, pass into flexures. Most of these\r\nflexures are of the monoclinal type (p. 516), which dynamically means\r\nmuch the same as a fault; but some of them may be of the compressive\r\ntype, without inconsistency with vertical fault-relief above. Research\r\nhas not yet covered thoroughly any great plateau, and knowledge of\r\nthis class of movements is less complete than that of folding by\r\nlateral thrust, and it has a less ample place in the literature of the\r\nsubject. The plateau-forming movements are, however, much more massive\r\nthan the mountain-folding movements, and stand next in magnitude to\r\nthe continent-forming movements. Plateaus may be regarded as smaller\r\nplatforms superposed on the continental platforms.\r\n\r\nIn the ocean-basins, there appear to be raised platforms of the\r\nplateau type, and there are remarkable “deeps” that have the aspect of\r\nanti-plateaus.\r\n\r\n=Continent-forming movements.=—True continent-forming movements\r\nappear to have antedated the earliest known sediments. As far back\r\nas we can read the sedimentary record, the continents seem to have\r\nbeen well established, and there is little evidence that they have\r\nsince been fundamentally changed. It is true that some very eminent\r\ngeologists have rather freely connected formations on one continent\r\nwith formations having similar faunas on an opposite continent, by a\r\nhypothetical conversion of the intervening ocean-bottoms into land\r\nor shallow water; but most such faunal relations can be explained\r\nalmost equally well by migration around the coasts, or at most by\r\nmere ridge-connections. The paucity, if not total absence, of abysmal\r\ndeposits in the strata of the continents, taken with the persistence\r\nof terrestrial and coastal faunas, leaves little room for assigning\r\nan interchange of position between abysmal depths and continental\r\nelevations, and _vice versa_. Dynamic considerations also offer grave\r\ndifficulties. The doctrine of the persistence of continents probably\r\nought not to be pushed so far as to exclude shallow water, or even\r\nland, connections between South America, Antarctica, Australia,\r\nIndia, and South Africa, directly or indirectly, at certain stages\r\nof geological history. Without forming final conclusions as to the\r\nmeasure of the change which the continents have suffered during known\r\ngeological history, it is safe to conclude that the continents and\r\nocean-basins were in the main formed very early in the earth’s history,\r\nand that subsequent changes have consisted chiefly in the further\r\nsinking of the basins and the further protrusion of the land, save as\r\nthe latter has been cut down by erosion. Incidentally, the ocean-basins\r\nhave probably been extended and the continents restricted. On the other\r\nhand, the continents have been built out on their borders by wash\r\nfrom the land, and the waters of the ocean have been somewhat lifted\r\nby the deposition of sediment in their basins. It is estimated that\r\nthe cutting away of the present continents, and the deposition of the\r\nmaterial in the ocean-basins, would raise the sea-level about 650 feet.\r\n(R. D. George.)\r\n\r\n=Relations of these movements in time.=—The folding movements seem\r\nto have had extraordinary prevalence in the earliest ages, for the\r\nArchean rocks are almost universally crumpled, and often in the most\r\nintricate fashion. There is no sign that the folding was then limited\r\nto the borders of the continents; it seems rather to have affected\r\nthe whole continental surface. After the beginning of the well-known\r\nsedimentary series, crumpling appears to have taken place chiefly at\r\nlong intervals, thus marking off great time-divisions, and to have been\r\nconfined at any given stage to certain tracts, chiefly on the borders\r\nof great segments of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nConcerning the plateau-forming movements in the past, knowledge is very\r\nmeager, as the detection of plateaus of ancient times is more difficult\r\nthan the detection of folds. Gentle warpings have apparently been in\r\nprogress at all times.\r\n\r\n=Relations of vertical to horizontal movements.=—The downward movements\r\nare unquestionably the primary ones, and the horizontal ones are\r\nsecondary and incidental. The fundamental feature is doubtless central\r\ncondensation actuated by gravity, and the master movements are the\r\nsinkings of the ocean-basins. The great periodic movements that made\r\nmountains and plateaus, and changed the capacity of the ocean-basins,\r\nprobably started with the sinking of part or all of the ocean-bottoms.\r\nIn the greater periodic movements, probably all the basins participated\r\nmore or less, but some seem to have been more active than others. For\r\nexample, in the last great mountain-making period, the Pacific basin\r\nseems to have been more active than the Atlantic, while in the similar\r\ngreat event at the close of the Paleozoic, the opposite seems to have\r\nbeen true. The squeezing up of the continents doubtless took place\r\nsimultaneously with the settling of the basins. The true conception is\r\nperhaps that the ocean-basins and continental platforms are but the\r\nsurface forms of great segments of the lithosphere, all of which crowd\r\ntoward the center, the stronger and heavier segments taking precedence\r\nand squeezing the weaker and lighter ones between them. The area of the\r\nmore depressed or master segments is almost exactly twice that of the\r\nprotruding or squeezed ones. This estimate includes in the latter about\r\n10,000,000 square miles now covered with shallow water. The volume\r\nof the hydrosphere is a little too great for the true basins, and it\r\nruns over, covering the borders of the continents. The amount of the\r\noverflow fluctuates from time to time, and may be neglected in a study\r\nof the movements and deformations of the lithosphere.\r\n\r\n=The squeezed segments.=—The great protruding segments show a tendency\r\ntoward rude triangularity. They are (1) the Eurasian, now strongly\r\nridged on the south and east, and relatively flat on the northwest;\r\n(2) the African, rather strongly ridged on the east, but less abruptly\r\nelevated on the west and north; (3) the North American, now strongly\r\nridged on the west, more gently on the east, and relatively flat at the\r\nnorth and in the interior; (4) the South American, strongly ridged on\r\nthe west and somewhat on the northeast and southeast.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing form the major group. The minor group embraces (5) the\r\nAntarctic segment, not as yet sufficiently known to be well defined,\r\nand (6) the Australian, broadly reniform rather than triangular. To\r\nthese are perhaps to be added (7) the largely submerged platform that\r\nstretches from Sumatra and Java on the southwest to the Philippines\r\non the northeast, and is attached to India on the northwest; and (8)\r\nGreenland, which, though closely associated with North America, is\r\npartially separated by a rather deep depression.\r\n\r\n=The depressed or master segments.=—The great sunken segments show\r\na tendency to assume roughly polygonal, rather than triangular,\r\nforms. This accords with the primary place assigned them, since, in a\r\nspherical surface divided into larger and smaller segments, the major\r\nparts should be polygonal while the minor residual segments are more\r\nlikely to be triangular. The major segments are (1) the Pacific, (2)\r\nthe Indian, (3) the North Atlantic, and (4) the South Atlantic. These\r\nform the principal group, while (5) the Arctic deeps (not including\r\nthe shallow epicontinental portions), (6) the Mediterranean, (7) the\r\nCaribbean, and (8) the chain of deep pits between the Philippine ridge\r\nand the Bornean platform, constitute a subordinate group.\r\n\r\nEach member of the minor group is an irregular chain of depressed pits\r\nrather than a single continuous deep, unless the Arctic depression, of\r\nwhich little is now known, proves an exception. They lie between the\r\ngreater segments at what may be conceived to be points of _critical\r\nworking relations_, and are accompanied by small elevated blocks. The\r\nCaribbean, the Mediterranean, and the Bornean regions are the seats of\r\nthe greatest present volcanic and related activities.\r\n\r\nIn a general view, there are then four great sunken quadrilaterals and\r\nfour great elevated triangles, with minor attendants in each class.\r\nLest fondness for simplicity and symmetry lead too far, we must hasten\r\nto observe that the _dimensions_ are not alike in either class. The\r\nPacific segment is more than twice the size of any other basin segment,\r\nand four times that of the North Atlantic. The Eurasian triangle is\r\nmore than twice the average size of the other land segments, and\r\nnearly three times that of the South American. Nor is there any large\r\ncommon divisor of approximate accuracy. This is not at all strange if\r\nthe earth be regarded as a body of somewhat heterogeneous composition\r\nwhich naturally shrank in rather irregular segments. On the other hand,\r\nthis irregularity is somewhat strange if the earth has evolved from a\r\nvery homogeneous and symmetrical, primitive, fluid state. It is also a\r\nserious consideration in any theory that appeals to crystalline form,\r\nor analogy, as in the doctrine of a tetrahedral earth.\r\n\r\nRoughly approximated in millions of square miles, the major depressed\r\nsegments are as follows: the Pacific, 60, the Indian, 27, the South\r\nAtlantic, 24, and the North Atlantic, 14, leaving 8 for minor\r\ndepressions. The elevated segments are Eurasian, 24, African, 12, North\r\nAmerican, 10, and South American, 9, leaving 10 for the minor blocks.\r\n\r\nIf these segments be regarded as the great integers of body-movement,\r\ntwo-thirds of them taking precedence in sinking and the other third\r\nin suffering distortion, it is easy to pass to the conception of\r\nsub-segments, moving somewhat differently from the main segments,\r\nso as to aid in their adjustment to one another, and thus to the\r\nconception of plateaus and deeps. It is easy also to pass to the\r\nconception of mutual crowding and crumpling at the edges of these\r\nsegments, accompanied by fracture and slipping. These conceptions\r\nperhaps represent the true relations between the massive movements\r\nof the abysmal and continental segments, as well as the less massive\r\nplateau-forming movements and the mountain-forming distortions. The\r\nmountains and plateaus are probably the incidental results of the\r\ngreat abysmal and continental readjustments.\r\n\r\nThe great movements are probably to be attributed to stresses that\r\ngradually accumulated until they overcame the rigidity of the thick\r\nmassive segments involved, and forced a readjustment. In accumulating\r\nthese stresses, some local yielding on weak lines and at special\r\npoints was an inevitable incident in distributing more equably the\r\naccumulating stresses. So, also, the first great readjustments probably\r\nleft many local strains and unequal stresses which gradually eased\r\nthemselves by warpings, minor faultings, etc., so that some minor\r\nmovements were a natural sequence of the great movements. But there\r\nwere doubtless many local and superficial causes, such as irregular\r\ngains and losses of heat, regional loading and unloading, solution,\r\nhydration, etc., that have caused local or regional movement, and which\r\nhave little to do with the great deformations of the earth’s body. As\r\nimplied above, the gentle, nearly constant movements probably fall\r\nmainly into a different category from the great periodic movements.\r\nBoth will be considered further.\r\n\r\n=The differential extent of the movements.=—Between the highest\r\nelevation of the land and the lowest depth of the ocean, there is a\r\nvertical range of nearly twelve miles. There may have been higher\r\nelevations, relatively, in past times, but probably not deeper\r\ndepressions; and so, if we assume that the surface was once perfectly\r\nspheroidal, this may be taken as a maximum expression of _differential_\r\nmovement, not _absolute_ vertical movement. From the Thibetan plateau,\r\nwhere a considerable area exceeds three miles in height, to the\r\nTuscarora deep, where a notable tract exceeds five miles in depth, the\r\nrange is eight miles, which may fairly represent the vertical range of\r\nrather massive differential movement. From the average height of the\r\ncontinents to the average abysmal bottoms of the oceans the range is\r\nnearly three miles, which may be taken as the differential movement of\r\nthe great segments. Under certain hypotheses of the origin and early\r\nhistory of the earth, to be sketched later, the surface is not assumed\r\nto have been perfectly spheroidal originally, and hence the present\r\nirregularities do not necessarily imply so great differential movement.\r\n\r\nIf the protruding portions of the lithosphere were graded down and the\r\nbasins graded up to a common level, this level would lie about 9000\r\nfeet below the ocean-surface. This equated level is the best basis\r\nof reference for relative segmental movements. Referred to this datum\r\nplane, the continents, having an area about half as great as that of\r\nthe ocean depths, have been squeezed up relatively about two miles,\r\nand the basins have sunk about one mile from the ideal common plane.\r\nThe total downward movement, representing the total shrinkage of the\r\nearth, is quite unknown from observation. It is probably very much\r\ngreater than the differential movement, as will appear from theoretical\r\nconsiderations as we go on.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the _lateral_ movements has a peculiar interest, for\r\nit bears theoretically on the shrinkage of the earth. Every mile of\r\ndescent of the crust represents 6 miles (6.28) shortening of the\r\ncircumference. If the vertical movements were limited to the _relative_\r\nones just named, the mile of basin descent would give but little more\r\nthan 6 miles of surplus circumference for lateral thrust and crumpling.\r\nHow far does this go in explaining the known facts? By measuring the\r\nfolds of the Alps, Heim has estimated the shortening represented by\r\nthem to be 74 miles.[243] Claypole estimated the shortening for the\r\nAppalachians in Pennsylvania, not including the crystalline belt on\r\nthe east, at 46 miles;[244] McConnel placed that of the Laramide range\r\nin British America at 25 miles,[245] and LeConte that of the Coast\r\nrange in California at 9 to 12 miles.[246] These estimates must be\r\ncorrected for the thickening and thinning of the beds in the process\r\nof folding, for the composite character of the folds, and for the\r\neffects of shearing and faulting. These will in part tend to increase\r\nand in part to decrease the estimates. The first effect of horizontal\r\nthrust is to close up all crevices and compact the beds as much as they\r\nwill stand without bending. A part of the unusual thickness which the\r\nbeds of folded regions commonly show is probably due to this edgewise\r\ncompression. In experiments on artificial strata made to illustrate\r\nfoldings (Fig. 449_a_), the thickening of the layers is a very\r\nappreciable part of the process, though probably natural beds do not\r\nthicken in equal proportion. After the beds have been closely folded\r\nand the thrust is athwart them, they are thinned and stretched on the\r\nlimbs of the fold. How far this and other causes of extension offset\r\ninitial compression is undetermined, and is differently estimated. It\r\nseems highly probable from the nature of the case that the edgewise\r\ncompression which resulted from sustaining the full stress before the\r\nbeds bent, was much greater than the crosswise compression on the limbs\r\nof the folds, which came into action only after the stress had been\r\nlargely satisfied by folding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 449_a_.—Illustrations of Willis’ experiments in\r\n  the artificial representation of mountain folding. The sections were\r\n  formed of layers of wax of different colors, and were mechanically\r\n  compressed from the right. The upper section shows the original\r\n  state, and the offsets of the succeeding sections at the right\r\n  indicate the amount of shortening. (Thirteenth Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol.\r\n  Surv.)]\r\n\r\nWhatever the correction, and whatever the probable errors of the above\r\nestimates, the amount of shortening involved in folding is large. The\r\nestimates given are merely those for certain periods of folding, and\r\nrepresent only that portion of the compression of the circumference\r\nwhich was concentrated in a given mountain range. The whole shortening\r\nof a circumference is to be found by adding together all the transverse\r\nfoldings on a given great circle, following it about the globe at\r\nright angles to a given folded tract. In so doing, it will be seen that\r\nthe belt does not usually cross more than one or two strongly folded\r\ntracts of the same age, from which it is inferred that the shortening\r\non each great circle was largely concentrated in a few tracts running\r\nat large angles to each other, to accommodate the shrinkage of the\r\nglobe in all directions. If the folding in a main range crossing\r\nany great circle is doubled, it will probably represent roughly the\r\nshortening for that entire circle for that age. If one is disposed\r\nto minimize the amount of folding, the estimate may perhaps be put\r\nroundly at 50 miles, on an entire circumference, for each of the great\r\nmountain-making periods. If, on the other hand, one is disposed to\r\ngive the estimates a generous figure so as to put explanations to the\r\nseverest test, he may perhaps fairly place the shortening at 100 miles,\r\nor even more. For the whole shortening since Cambrian times, perhaps\r\ntwice these amounts might suffice, for while there have been several\r\nmountain-making periods, only three are perhaps entitled to be put\r\nin the first order, that at the close of the Paleozoic, that at the\r\nclose of the Mesozoic, and that in the late Tertiary. The shortening\r\nin the Proterozoic period was considerable, but is imperfectly known.\r\nThe Archean rocks suffered great compression in their own times, and\r\nprobably shared in that of all later periods, and if their shortening\r\ncould be estimated closely, it might be taken as covering the whole.\r\nAssuming the circumferential shortening to have been 50 miles during a\r\ngiven great mountain-folding period, the appropriate radial shrinkage\r\nis 8 miles. For the more generous estimate of 100 miles, it is 16\r\nmiles. If these estimates be doubled for the whole of the Paleozoic and\r\nlater eras, the radial shortening becomes 16 and 32 miles, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CAUSES OF MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _General Considerations._\r\n\r\nThe volume of the earth is at all times dependent on two sets of\r\nantagonistic forces, (1) the attractive or centripetal, consisting of\r\ngravity and the molecular and sub-molecular attractions, and (2) the\r\nresistant forces—which are not necessarily centrifugal—consisting of\r\nheat and the resistant molecular and sub-molecular forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. _The centripetal agencies._\r\n\r\n=Gravity.=—The most obvious of the concentrating forces is gravity,\r\nand in most questions relating to great segmental movements, it has\r\nbeen thought sufficient to consider gravity alone, but it is by no\r\nmeans certain that this does not lead to serious error. In studying\r\nthe causes and effects of earth movements, it is necessary to consider\r\nboth gravitational _energy_ and gravitational _force_. Gravitational\r\n_energy_ is greatest when the mass is most widely dispersed, and least\r\nwhen most concentrated. Gravitational _force_ is greatest when the mass\r\nis most concentrated, and least when most dispersed. The gravitational\r\nenergy of the earth matter was at its maximum when it was most widely\r\ndiffused in the supposed nebulous condition. It will perhaps reach\r\nits minimum at some future period when the shrinkage shall reach its\r\nlimit. In passing from an expanded condition to a more concentrated\r\ncondition, potential energy, or energy of position, is transformed\r\ninto other forms of energy, chiefly heat. The heat thus developed\r\nis an important factor in the earth’s dynamics. The total amount of\r\ngravitational energy involved in the earth’s evolution is unknown, for\r\nneither the maximum dispersion of the earliest state, nor the ultimate\r\ncondensation, is known. It is not difficult, however, to compute the\r\namount of transformation of gravitational energy into heat, or other\r\nforms of energy, during a given degree of condensation. If a mass\r\nequal to that of the earth were originally infinitely scattered, the\r\ngravitational energy given up by it in condensing into a homogeneous\r\nsphere of the earth’s present size would, if all transformed into heat,\r\nsuffice to raise the temperature of an equal mass of water 8900° C.\r\n(Hoskins), or an equal mass of rock (specific heat of .2), 44,500° C.\r\nIf the mass were more condensed toward the center, as is the actual\r\ncase, the heat would be considerably greater. If the condensation\r\ntoward the center followed the Laplacian law (p. 564), the heat would\r\nbe sufficient to raise the earth mass 48,900° C., assuming its specific\r\nheat to be .2, which is about the average specific heat of rock at\r\nthe surface (Lunn). A further shrinkage of one mile would transform\r\nan additional amount of gravitational energy into heat about equal in\r\namount to Tait’s estimate of the loss of heat from the surface of the\r\nearth in 100,000,000 years (see p. 572). If the radial shrinkage has\r\nbeen 32 miles, or even 16 miles, the amount of heat generated is very\r\nmuch greater than the estimated loss from the surface.\r\n\r\nHow much gravitational energy can possibly be transformed into heat and\r\nother forms of energy in the future, can only be computed by making\r\nassumptions as to the possible extent of further contraction, and that\r\ninvolves hypotheses as to the atomic and sub-atomic constitution of the\r\nearth’s matter, and its behavior under the prodigious pressures of the\r\nearth’s interior. All shrinkage develops added gravitational force and\r\nfurther tendency to shrinkage, which follows when the heat generated by\r\nthe shrinkage is lost; and where the process may end, in a body of the\r\ndimensions of the earth, is beyond present determination. If there were\r\nno limit to the density that might be attained, it would be impossible\r\nto assign any limit to the energy that might be transformed. It has\r\nusually been assumed that contraction could not go on indefinitely\r\nbecause the atoms would come into actual contact, and prevent further\r\nincrease of density. This conception rests on the recently prevalent\r\nhypothesis of the atomic constitution of matter; but the more recent\r\nhypotheses that substitute multitudes of revolving corpuscles or\r\nelectrons for irreducible atoms, do not carry the same presumption of a\r\nrigorous limit to condensation. It is not therefore prudent to try to\r\nset such a limit, or to make it a feature in the dynamical doctrines\r\nof the earth. It is even less prudent to try to measure the limit of\r\nfuture conversion of the gravitational energy of the sun into heat, and\r\nso to set a limit to the habitability of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe _force_ of gravity may be defined as the effort of gravitational\r\nenergy to change into other forms of energy. It is most familiarly\r\nexpressed in terms of weight, which is the resultant of the\r\ngravitational force of the whole earth upon a given portion. Weight is\r\ndetermined by the distances and directions of the given portion from\r\nall parts of the attracting mass, the amount of the attraction being\r\ndirectly as the mass and inversely as the square of the distance,\r\nmodified by the direction. It is greatest about 610 miles below the\r\nsurface, where it is 1.0392 times that at the surface. Below this point\r\nit declines, and at the center it is zero. The sum total of the earth’s\r\ngravitative force at the present time is equivalent to about 6 × 10²¹\r\ntons. This gives rise to a pressure of about 3,000,000 atmospheres at\r\nthe center of the earth.\r\n\r\nGravitational force is also expressed in terms of the earth’s ability\r\nto accelerate the velocity of falling bodies at its surface, which is\r\nnow approximately 32 feet per second. For certain purposes, the force\r\nof gravity may be better pictured by means of the velocity required\r\nto overbalance it, which is 6.9 miles per second; e.g. a body shot\r\naway from the surface at a speed exceeding 6.9 miles per second, would\r\nescape from the control of the earth if the influence of the atmosphere\r\nand other bodies is neglected; while a body shot away at less than this\r\nspeed would return to the earth.\r\n\r\n=Molecular and sub-molecular attractions.=—In addition to gravity,\r\nthere are at least three additional classes of attractive agencies\r\nwhose laws appear to differ from those of gravity, viz. cohesion,\r\nchemical affinity, and sub-atomic attraction, using these terms in\r\ntheir comprehensive generic senses. The thought has been entertained\r\nthat these might be reducible to forms of gravity in ulterior analysis,\r\nbut it does not appear from existing evidence that the laws of their\r\nattractions are conformable to the Newtonian law of the inverse\r\nsquare of the distance, to which gravity conforms. Apparently the\r\nforces of the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic attractions increase\r\nat higher rates, and have individual peculiarities of action quite\r\ndifferent from gravity. It would be of the utmost service to geological\r\nphilosophy if these laws of molecular and sub-molecular attractions\r\nwere firmly established, and could be applied to the conditions of\r\nheat and pressure under which the matter of the interior of the earth\r\nexists. In the absence of such determinations, we can do little more\r\nthan recognize that the matter of the interior of the earth tends to\r\ncondense itself by the aid of molecular and sub-molecular attractions,\r\nsupplemental to the attraction of gravity.\r\n\r\n=Cohesion and crystallization.=—The force of gravity between small\r\nbodies is exceedingly feeble, but it is cumulative, every particle in a\r\nmass attracting every other particle, so that in great masses the force\r\nbecomes enormous. In cohesion, and probably in the other molecular and\r\nsub-molecular attractions, the particles attract very strongly the\r\nparticles with which they are in close relations, but beyond minute\r\ndistances their effects are insensible. The force of crystallization\r\nis felt for a very short distance from the crystal, and “mass action”\r\nis probably dependent on a function of similar kind, acting at a very\r\nsmall distance, but the range of these forces is very limited in\r\ncomparison with that of gravity.\r\n\r\nRock matter, as a rule, tends to become crystalline by the assembling\r\nof like molecules in systematic order. The general effect is\r\ncondensation, though this is not universally the case, for in some\r\ninstances the crystalline arrangement results in expansion. The\r\ncrystallizing force may be regarded as a specialized variety of\r\ncohesion which usually coöperates with gravity to produce increased\r\ndensity. In cases of expansion it seems clear that the organizing force\r\ndoes not act according to the law of gravity. The intensity of the\r\nforce exhibited in the formation of ice illustrates the superiority of\r\nthe molecular force over the gravitative force in small masses; but in\r\na planet of ice of very moderate dimensions, the internal pressure of\r\ngravity would overcome the crystalline force, which illustrates the\r\nsuperiority of gravity in large masses.\r\n\r\nWhile the crystalline force may thus in exceptional cases operate\r\nagainst gravity, it is known that in most cases it not only operates\r\nwith it, but is controlled by it, in this sense—that where a substance\r\nhas two forms of crystallization, it will take the denser one when the\r\npressure is great. The inference is that if the less dense form of\r\ncrystallization takes place under slight pressure, and subsequently\r\nthe pressure is greatly increased, the form of crystallization will\r\nchange from the less to the more dense.[247] It is probable that in\r\ngeneral those forms of molecular arrangement will be assumed in the\r\ndeep zones which give the greatest density, and this probably includes\r\nconcretionary, colloidal, and other forms of aggregation, as well as\r\ncrystallization.\r\n\r\n=Diffusion.=—The same law probably holds relative to diffusion, though\r\nin a molecular sense diffusion is the opposite of crystallization,\r\nfor in crystallization, like comes to like, while in diffusion the\r\nmolecules distribute themselves among those of unlike nature. Diffusive\r\naction, quite familiar in gases and liquids, takes place to some extent\r\nin solids. The molecules of plates of gold and lead brought into\r\nintimate contact under pressure mutually diffuse among one another.\r\nSo gases seem to be very generally diffused or “occluded” in rocks,\r\nthough the nature of this relation is imperfectly determined. It\r\nis known that pressure upon gases promotes their diffusion through\r\nliquids and solids. It is inferred that pressure upon a solid tends\r\nto the diffusion of the entrapped gases within it, but it is not to\r\nbe inferred from this that pressure upon rock promotes the absorption\r\nof gases into it, but rather the opposite. It is probable that great\r\npressure with high heat promotes the diffusion of entrapped gases or\r\nother diffusible substances through the rock-mass, and at the same time\r\ntends to their extrusion along lines of least resistance; but this is\r\nan inference rather than a demonstration.\r\n\r\n=Chemical combination.=—The general effect of chemical combination\r\nunder pressure is greater density. In reversible reactions capable of\r\nconditions of chemical or physical equilibrium, pressure invariably\r\nfavors the formation of the denser of any possible products.\r\n\r\n=Sub-atomic forces.=—Recent investigation has made it probable\r\nthat atoms are composite, embracing many exceedingly minute\r\nbodies—corpuscles or electrons—in a state of extremely high activity\r\nand possessed of marvelous energy notwithstanding their minuteness.\r\nThis discovery possesses deep interest to the geologist because it\r\nseems to reveal sources of energy of almost incalculable potency, some\r\nportions of which at least are being constantly freed and added to\r\nthe previously recognized supplies of energy. Attempts have been made\r\nduring the past few decades to limit the habitable age of the earth,\r\nboth retrospectively and prospectively, by the smallness of the sum\r\ntotal of energy derivable from gravity. In these estimates slight\r\nrecognition has been given to the resources of molecular and atomic\r\nenergy, and none at all to the possibilities of sub-atomic energy. It\r\nwould be going quite too far to assume that these sub-atomic energies\r\nare all available for the perpetuation of habitable conditions on\r\nthe earth or in the solar system, but we are doubtless justified in\r\nappealing to them as an offset to all dicta restricting the period\r\nof the earth’s habitability by supposed insufficiencies of energy\r\ndeduced merely from the estimated resources of gravity. The banishment\r\nof the idea of the atom as a minute, incompressible, undecomposable\r\nsphere takes away the theoretical limit of compressibility, and by\r\nso doing cuts away the groundwork for assigning definite limits even\r\nto the resources of gravity, since, as already indicated, unlimited\r\ncondensation gives theoretically unlimited transformation of the\r\npotential energy of gravity.\r\n\r\nWhile we must await with such patience as we can command the\r\ndevelopment of fuller knowledge concerning the nature and laws of the\r\nmolecular, atomic, and sub-atomic energies, and their applicability to\r\nthe activities resident in the interior of the earth, it is permissible\r\neven now to assume that, besides the simple compressive action of\r\ngravity, there are at work varied forms of molecular aggregation, of\r\natomic combination, and perhaps of sub-atomic change, tending toward\r\nincreased density, and that the ulterior limit of these processes is\r\nquite undetermined. The condensational forces are now restrained at\r\ncertain temporary limits by the antagonistic resistant forces, some of\r\nwhich, such as heat, are the products of the condensational forces, and\r\nare gradually being dissipated, permitting further condensation. Where\r\nthe process may ultimately end, we dare not attempt to say. On the\r\nother hand, we are not compelled to accept assigned limits that seem to\r\nbe inconsistent with the phenomena which the earth actually presents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     2. _The resisting agencies._\r\n\r\n=Heat.=—The most familiar of the active agencies that resist\r\ncondensation is heat. Upon this the existing volume of the earth is\r\nimmediately dependent, in some large part at least. As this heat is\r\ndissipated, the earth shrinks. This shrinkage increases the force of\r\ngravity, and hence the internal pressure increases, and, if further\r\ncompression takes place as the result of this increased pressure,\r\nadditional heat is developed, which checks further condensation until\r\nit is dissipated. It is this kind of creative and self-checking action\r\nthat determines the volume of great gaseous bodies like the sun. Though\r\ntheir matter is far from its ultimate density, and their self-gravity\r\nis enormous, they condense slowly, because, with every stage of\r\ncondensation, heat is generated which antagonizes gravity and checks\r\ncondensation, until at least a part of the heat is radiated away.\r\nAs the force of gravity increases with every stage of condensation,\r\nthe heat developed to hold it in check must increase, and hence the\r\nfamous law of Lane, that a gaseous body like the sun grows hotter as\r\nit condenses. This law holds good while the body remains in a gaseous\r\nstate in which the maintenance of the volume is essentially dependent\r\non heat. When a body becomes liquid or solid, its volume is dependent\r\nin part on forms of resistance other than heat, and the force of the\r\nlaw is abated, though the principle still holds good. In small solids,\r\nthe principle has little application, since the force of self-gravity\r\nis slight compared to the resisting forces, and very little new heat\r\nis generated as the body loses that which it has; but in large bodies,\r\nlike the earth, where the condensational forces are enormous and the\r\ninternal temperature is very high, it is not improbable that the heat\r\ngenerated at every stage of condensation is relatively large. It has\r\nbeen inferred by some students of the phenomena that the conditions\r\nin the interior of the earth are essentially those of gaseous matter,\r\nso far as molecular relations are concerned, because the temperatures\r\nare thought to be above the critical temperatures of the substances\r\ncomposing it. If this be true, the new heat generated with each stage\r\nof condensation is large. However this may be, it seems safe to infer\r\nthat in so far as the volume of the interior mass is dependent on heat\r\nresistance, _the loss of existing heat leads to the generation of\r\nnew heat_. The amount of this new heat must be enough, together with\r\nthe residual heat and the other forces of resistance, to match the\r\nnew condensational forces. The molecular and sub-molecular forces of\r\nresistance other than heat, are probably responsible for some large\r\npart of the resistance to the increased condensational force, but how\r\nmuch is not determined.\r\n\r\n=All resistance perhaps due to motion.=—As now interpreted, the force\r\nof resistance of heat is due to the impact of the flying particles\r\nof the heated matter. The other forms of resistance to compression\r\nhave not usually been interpreted in this way, but the tendency of\r\nrecent investigation is to place them in the same dynamic class.\r\nA cold solid body offers resistance to compression that is in no\r\nobvious way dependent on heat motion. In small bodies this resistance\r\nis immeasurably greater than the self-gravity of the body. It is so\r\ngreat that it can only be partially overcome by any force which human\r\ningenuity can bring to bear upon it. This form of resistance has thus,\r\nnot unnaturally, come to be regarded as approximately immeasurable, and\r\nperhaps as grading into actual immeasurability, and as resting back\r\nupon the actual contact of irreducible atoms. But the recent researches\r\nwhich have developed grounds for the conception that even the atoms\r\nare composite, lead to the further conception that their resistance\r\nto compression is dependent on the movement of their constituent\r\ncorpuscles or electrons. This encourages the broad conception that the\r\nwhole of the resistance to compression arises from molecular, atomic,\r\nand sub-atomic _motions_, of which heat is merely one form.\r\n\r\nWhile all this is yet on the frontier of physical progress, these\r\nconceptions may well be recognized in framing interpretations of the\r\nagencies which determine the volume of the earth, and which control\r\nthe changes that take place in it from age to age. The result of their\r\ncombined action at any stage is _a state of temporary equilibrium_\r\nbetween gravity, aided by the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic\r\nattractions, on the one hand, and heat, aided by the molecular,\r\natomic, and sub-atomic resistances, on the other. The vital problem\r\nis to ascertain _the original condition of balance_ between these\r\nantagonistic forces, and the changes which have affected that balance\r\nsince. The original state of balance is necessarily a matter of\r\nhypothesis, and the best that can be done at present is to picture\r\nas clearly as possible the different hypotheses that have been\r\nentertained, and the different consequences that logically flow from\r\nthem. The most important factor in the case is the original amount and\r\ndistribution of internal heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF ORIGINAL HEAT DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical modes of origin of the earth will be treated in the\r\nhistorical section. Suffice it here to say that one view is that the\r\nearth was once gaseous, passed thence into a liquid, and later into\r\na solid state. Under this view, there are two hypotheses as to the\r\noriginal distribution of internal heat, dependent on the mode of\r\nsolidification. According to the one, solidification began at the\r\nsurface after convection had brought the temperature of the whole\r\nmass down nearly to the point of congelation; according to the other,\r\nsolidification began at the center at a high temperature, because of\r\npressure, and proceeded thence outwards. The former only has been much\r\ndeveloped in the literature of the subject, though the latter is now\r\ngenerally regarded as the more probable.\r\n\r\nAnother view of the globe’s origin is that the earth was built up\r\ngradually by the infall of matter, bit by bit, at such a rate that\r\nthough each little mass became hot as a result of its fall, it cooled\r\noff before others fell on the same spot, the rain of matter not being\r\nfast enough to heat up the whole mass to the melting-point. Under this\r\nview, the internal heat arose chiefly from compression due to the\r\nearth’s gravity.\r\n\r\nA clear conception of the three hypotheses of thermal distribution\r\nwhich rest on these two views of the origin of the earth is important\r\nto the further discussion.\r\n\r\n=1. Thermal distribution on the convection hypothesis.=—It was\r\nformerly the prevailing opinion that the molten condition of the\r\nearth persisted in the interior until after the crust had formed,\r\nand that solidification proceeded from the surface downwards. It was\r\na natural corollary of this view that, previous to the beginning of\r\nsolidification, convection stirred the liquid mass from center to\r\ncircumference and equalized the temperature so that the whole mass\r\ncooled down equably until it approached the point of solidification\r\nand became too viscous for ready convection. The temperature should,\r\ntherefore, have been nearly the same from center to surface at the\r\nstage just preceding incipient solidification. This conception forms\r\nthe basis of most discussions involving internal temperatures.[248]\r\nThe famous studies of Lord Kelvin are based on the assumption of a\r\nuniform initial temperature of 7000° Fahr.[249] Other temperatures\r\nhave been assumed in similar studies by others, but the results do not\r\ndiffer materially. On this hypothesis there would be no deep-seated\r\nchange of temperature until a temperature-gradient, extending to the\r\ndeeper horizons, had been developed by surface cooling. In the earliest\r\neras, the loss of heat would be felt solely in the outer zone. By\r\nsurface cooling, a temperature gradient would be slowly developed, and\r\ngradually changed from age to age, as shown by the curved lines in\r\nFig. 450, each of which shows the temperature at the successive stages\r\nstated in the legend. The computations for these curves were based\r\non the methods and assumptions of Lord Kelvin. The two lower curves\r\nrepresent greater periods than those usually assigned by geologists to\r\nthe whole history of the earth. It will be seen that the modification\r\nof the original temperature line extends only about 160 miles below the\r\nsurface for the 100,000,000-year period, only about 240 miles for the\r\n237,000,000-year period, and only about 320 miles for the excessive\r\nperiod of 600,000,000 years. The superficial nature of the whole\r\nthermal problem under this hypothesis is thus made clear and impressive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 450.—Diagram showing the original distribution\r\n  of heat assumed by the convection hypothesis and the modifications\r\n  of this distribution near the surface in successive long periods.\r\n  The base-line of the figure represents divisions of the earth-radius\r\n  with center at the left and surface at the right. The vertical\r\n  lines represent temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 5000° C. The\r\n  assumed initial temperature 3900° C. (7000° F.) is represented by\r\n  the horizontal line TC, full at the left and dotted at the right to\r\n  indicate the original extension of the initial temperature to the\r\n  surface. The upper curve at the right shows how much the temperature\r\n  will have been modified at the end of 100,000,000 years, computed\r\n  according to the method of Lord Kelvin. The middle curve shows the\r\n  change at the end of 237,000,000 years, and the lower curve the\r\n  change at the end of 600,000,000 years. Similar curves may be found\r\n  in an article by Clarence King, Am. Jour. of Sci., XLV, 1893, p. 16.]\r\n\r\nAfter the outer shell had cooled so as to be in approximate equilibrium\r\nwith the environment of the earth, it suffered practically no\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nSo also it appears from the diagram that there was practically no\r\ncontraction below 160 miles up to the end of the 100,000,000-year\r\nperiod, because cooling had not yet reached that depth. Between these\r\ntwo non-contracting horizons the greatest rate of contraction at the\r\nclose of the 100,000,000-year period lay about 60 miles below the\r\nsurface. The contraction of this middle zone, while the outermost shell\r\nand the interior body remained constant, is held to have developed a\r\nstate of horizontal thrust in the outer shell, because this shell,\r\nbeing too large for the shrinking subcrust, tended to settle, and\r\nto crowd upon itself horizontally. The wrinkling and other modes of\r\ndeformation of the outer part of the earth are referred, under this\r\nview, to the thrust so developed. This is the view which has been most\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\n=Level of no stress.=—As the outer shell is thus held to be in a state\r\nof thrust while the zone below is in a state of shrinkage, there must\r\nbe, between these two zones, a _level of no stress_, where there is\r\nneither compression nor stretching. Above this level, the thrust\r\nincreases to the surface, and below it, the stretching increases to the\r\ndepth of most rapid change of temperature, below which it decreases\r\nand finally vanishes at the lower limit of temperature change. In the\r\nearliest stages of cooling, the level of no stress must have been\r\nnear the surface, and must have descended gradually as the cooling\r\nproceeded. The depth of this level has been repeatedly computed on\r\nthe basis of assumed times and rates of cooling. Fisher, assuming\r\nthe temperature of solidification to have been 4000° Fahr. and the\r\nperiod of cooling 33,000,000 years, computed its depth at only ⁷⁄₁₀\r\nof a mile below the surface.[250] T. Mellard Reade, with somewhat\r\ndifferent assumptions, placed it at 2 miles after 100,000,000 years\r\nof cooling.[251] Davison (1897) placed it at 2.17 miles,[252] and G. H.\r\nDarwin at 2 miles after the same period.[252] In a later computation,\r\nbased on the assumption that the coefficient of dilatation increases\r\nwith the temperature, Davison placed the level of no stress at 7.79\r\nmiles, and stated that if the coefficient of conductivity and the\r\ninitial heat also increased down wards, the zone would lie still\r\ndeeper. To suppose the initial heat to increase downwards, however, is\r\nto abandon the hypothesis we are now considering. These computations\r\nseem to show that, at the very utmost, the level of no stress, under\r\nthis hypothesis, lies at a very slight depth, and that the thrust zone\r\nabove is, therefore, very shallow. This should be kept constantly in\r\nmind in all deductions drawn from this hypothesis. If the thickness\r\nof the thrust zone be taken at 8 or 10 miles, it will apparently be\r\nconceding to the view all that can legitimately be claimed for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 451.—Diagram illustrating the internal\r\n  temperatures of the earth when it first became solid, under the\r\n  hypothesis that it solidified from the center outward, and assuming\r\n  that the fusing-point rose directly as the pressure, in accordance\r\n  with Barus’ experiments with diabase.

Thermal distribution on the hypothesis of central\r\nsolidification.=—When the previous conception was first formed, the\r\neffect of pressure on the melting-points of lavas was neglected, as\r\nlittle or nothing was known on the subject. Experiment, however, has\r\nshown that pressure, as a rule, raises the melting-points of lavas, and\r\nout of this has grown the doctrine that the earth solidified first at\r\nthe center, where the pressure was greatest, and gradually congealed\r\noutwards. Barus has shown that the melting-point of diabase,[253]\r\nselected as a representative rock, rises directly with the pressure.\r\nIf this rate holds good to the center of the earth, the melting\r\ntemperature of diabase there would be 76,000° C. (136,800°F.). The\r\nrange of the experiment is, however, very small compared with the range\r\nof the application, and little confidence can be felt in the special\r\nnumerical result reached. The rate of rise of the fusion-point may\r\nbe much changed as the extraordinary conditions of the deep interior\r\nare invaded. Still there is good ground for the hypothesis that\r\nsolidification took place at some very high temperature at the center,\r\nbecause of the very great pressure there. The inference then is that\r\nwhen the temperature of the center of the supposed molten globe reached\r\nthe appropriate point, solidification began there, and that it took\r\nplace at lesser depths in succession as the appropriate temperatures\r\nwere reached. This view _excludes convection_ in the successive\r\nzones from the center outward after the time when their temperatures\r\nof solidification were reached, or after these were approached\r\nsufficiently near to develop prohibitive viscosity. Some loss of heat\r\nfrom these horizons would be suffered while the outer parts were\r\nsolidifying, but on account of the exceedingly slow conductivity of\r\nrock, it is improbable that the amount of loss would be sufficient\r\nto change the general character of the internal distribution of heat\r\nprevious to solidification at the surface, the time when the existing\r\nphase of the earth’s history by hypothesis began. Fig. 451 shows the\r\ntheoretical distribution of heat under this view. The consequences of\r\nthis assumption are very important to geological theory and, carried\r\nout to their logical consequences, lead to the conclusion that cooling\r\nand shrinkage _affected the deep interior of the earth_, for the\r\nhigh central heat must have been constantly passing out toward the\r\nsurface. Instead, therefore, of the contraction being concentrated\r\nin and limited to the outer 200 miles or so, as under the preceding\r\nhypothesis, it was deeply distributed. The contraction within the outer\r\nzone would be less than under the preceding view, because the flow\r\nof heat from within would partially offset the flow outwards, and a\r\ncorresponding part of the contraction would be distributed below.\r\n\r\n      COMPUTED PRESSURES, DENSITIES, AND TEMPERATURES WITHIN THE\r\n                     EARTH BASED ON LAPLACE’s LAW.\r\n\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------+-------------+\r\n  | Distance   |   Pressure   |          |             |\r\n  |from center | in megadynes |          | Temperature |\r\n  |in terms of |   per sq.    | Density. |     in      |\r\n  |  radius.   |   cm.[254]   |          | degrees C.  |\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |   1.00     |          0   |   2.80   |        0    |\r\n  |    .95     |     97,000   |   3.37   |      320    |\r\n  |    .90     |    215,000   |   3.95   |    1,110    |\r\n  |    .85     |    353,000   |   4.54   |    2,190    |\r\n  |    .80     |    510,000   |   5.13   |    3,470    |\r\n  |    .75     |    684,000   |   5.71   |    4,880    |\r\n  |    .70     |    874,000   |   6.28   |    6,350    |\r\n  |    .65     |  1,077,000   |   6.84   |    7,860    |\r\n  |    .60     |  1,289,000   |   7.38   |    9,360    |\r\n  |    .55     |  1,507,000   |   7.90   |   10,830    |\r\n  |    .50     |  1,727,000   |   8.39   |   12,250    |\r\n  |    .45     |  1,944,000   |   8.84   |   13,590    |\r\n  |    .40     |  2,154,000   |   9.26   |   14,840    |\r\n  |    .35     |  2,353,000   |   9.64   |   15,980    |\r\n  |    .30     |  2,535,000   |   9.98   |   17,000    |\r\n  |    .25     |  2,698,000   |  10.27   |   17,880    |\r\n  |    .20     |  2,836,000   |  10.51   |   18,610    |\r\n  |    .15     |  2,947,000   |  10.70   |   19,190    |\r\n  |    .10     |  3,029,000   |  10.84   |   19,610    |\r\n  |    .05     |  3,078,000   |  10.92   |   19,870    |\r\n  |    .00     |  3,095,000   |  10.95   |   19,950    |\r\n  +------------+--------------+----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n=3. Thermal distribution under the accretion hypothesis.=—The accretion\r\nhypothesis assumes that the internal heat was gradually developed from\r\nthe center outwards as the earth grew and the internal compression\r\nwas progressively developed. The heat, therefore, continued to rise\r\nat the center as long as compression continued, or at least as long\r\nas the compression was sufficient to generate heat faster than it\r\nwas conducted outwards. As the conduction of heat through rock is\r\nexceedingly slow, the central heat may be assumed to have continued to\r\nrise so long as the infall of matter caused appreciable compression.\r\nIn the same way, heat was generated progressively in the less central\r\nparts, and these parts also received the heat that passed out from\r\nbeneath. It is assumed under this hypothesis that the degree of\r\ninterior compression stands in close relation to interior density,\r\nfor while there would probably be some segregation of heavier matter\r\ntoward the center and of lighter toward the surface by means of\r\nvolcanic action and internal rearrangement under stress differences,\r\nthe interior density is regarded as due mainly to compression. The\r\ndistribution of internal pressure and density generally accepted is\r\nthat of Laplace, who assumed that the increase of the density varies\r\nas the square root of the increase of the pressure. This law gives a\r\ndistribution of density that accords fairly well with the phenomena of\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, which require that the higher densities\r\nof the interior shall be distributed in certain proportions between\r\nthe center and the equatorial protuberance whose attraction by the sun\r\nand moon causes precession. The increases in pressure, density, and\r\ntemperature have been computed as follows by Mr. A. C. Lunn,[255] the\r\naverage specific gravity of the earth being taken at 5.6, the surface\r\nspecific gravity at 2.8, and the specific heat at .2.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures are shown graphically in Fig. 452, in which the\r\ncurves of pressure and density are also given. The nature of the curve\r\nof temperature is such that, if the thermometric conductivity of the\r\nmaterial is uniform at all depths, the temperature _will fall in the\r\ndeeper portions and rise in the outer ones_, excluding the surface\r\nportions subject to outside cooling. The curve indicates that the\r\nrising temperature would affect somewhat more than 800 miles of the\r\nouter part of the spheroid, or about half its volume, i.e. the inner\r\nhalf during the initial period had a falling temperature and the\r\nouter half, except the immediate surface, a rising temperature. This\r\nintroduces a very singular feature into the problem, for the outer\r\nzone must shrink to fit the inner portion that is losing heat, while\r\nits own material is expanding because of its increase of temperature.\r\nA double distortional effect must result.[256] If the conductivity of\r\nthe dense interior is greater than that of the outer parts, the effect\r\nis intensified. The redistribution of heat resulting from this unequal\r\nflowage would in time change the curve so that more nearly equal\r\nflowage would result. It would probably take a very long period for\r\nthis to be effected, on account of the very slow conductivity of rock.\r\n\r\nThe accretion hypothesis assumes that, during the growth of the\r\nearth, large amounts of heat were carried by volcanic action from\r\ndeeper horizons to higher ones and to the surface, and that this\r\nstill continues at a diminished rate. It assumes that whenever the\r\ninterior heat raised any constituent of the interior matter above\r\nits fusing-point under the local pressure, it passed into the liquid\r\nstate, _and was forced outwards by the stress differences to which\r\nit was subjected_, unless its specific gravity was sufficiently\r\nhigh to counterbalance them. It is conceived that the more fusible\r\nportions were liquefied first, and that in so doing they absorbed the\r\nnecessary heat of liquefaction and began to work their way outward,\r\ncarrying their heat into higher horizons and temporarily checking the\r\ndevelopment of more intense stresses in the lower horizons. They thus\r\nserved to keep the temperature there below the fusion-point of the\r\nremaining more refractory substances. Meanwhile the extruded portions\r\nwere raising the temperatures of the higher horizons into which\r\nthey were intruded or through which they were forced to pass. There\r\nwas thus, it is thought, an automatic action that tended to reduce\r\nthe heat-curve to the fusion-curve. _The actual curve of internal\r\ntemperature may, therefore, be practically the fusion-curve._ This\r\nis identical with the curve supposed to arise from solidification by\r\npressure from the center outward under the molten hypothesis, except\r\nso far as the two would vary as the result of variations in the\r\ndistribution of matter, which would not be quite the same under the two\r\nhypotheses. The curve of fusion deduced by an extension of the results\r\nof Barus’ experiment has been given. It is necessary to recognize\r\nthat the rate of rise of the fusion-point may, and very likely\r\ndoes, change in the deep interior. The curve given represents much\r\nhigher temperatures in the central parts than those given by Lunn’s\r\ncomputations from compression, which seem inherently more probable than\r\nthe higher ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 452.—Diagram illustrating the distribution of\r\n  temperature under the accretion hypothesis (neglecting the heat from\r\n  infall and other external sources). The divisions of the base-line\r\n  represent fractions of the earth’s radius. The vertical divisions\r\n  represent both pressure in megadynes per sq. cm., nearly the same as\r\n  atmospheres per sq. in., at the left, and temperatures in degrees C.\r\n  at the right. It is to be noted that the temperature scale is 2000°\r\n  C. per division, while that of Fig. 451 is 5000° C. per division.\r\n  The upper curve at the left, PC, is the pressure curve. The middle\r\n  curve, DC, is the density curve, beginning at 2.8 at the surface\r\n  and reaching nearly 11 at the center. The lower curve, TC, is the\r\n  temperature curve, rising from the surface temperature, 0° C., at\r\n  the right, to 20,000° C. at the center. It is to be noted that the\r\n  portion of this curve at the left representing the deeper part of\r\n  the earth is convex upwards, while the portion at the right is\r\n  concave. It will be seen that the gradient increases from the center\r\n  to a point between .6 and .7 radius, and then decreases, and that\r\n  between .8 radius and the surface, a distance of about 800 miles, the\r\n  decrease is notable. This means that with an equal coefficient of\r\n  conductivity the flow from the center outward to .6 or .7 radius will\r\n  be faster than the flow from .8 radius to the surface, neglecting\r\n  the immediate surface effects of external cooling. These curves were\r\n  worked out by Mr. Lunn.]\r\n\r\nAs astronomical and seismic evidences strongly favor the view that\r\nthe earth is rigid throughout, they lend support to the view that\r\nthe interior retains its rigidity by the extrusion of liquid matter\r\npractically as fast as it is formed, and that this progressive\r\nextrusion adjusts the temperature to that which is consistent with\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this conception becomes evident on consideration. The\r\nshrinkage of the earth from loss of heat by conduction and by the\r\nextrusion of molten rock, affects the deep interior as well as the\r\nmore superficial zones. _It is even possible that the shrinkage may\r\noriginate chiefly in the deeper zones._ The postulated transfer of\r\nfluid rock from the deeper parts to the more superficial ones lessens\r\nthe heat in the former, and adds to that in the latter. The postulated\r\ngreater flow of heat from the deeper half to the outer half, than from\r\nthe latter outward, gives a concordant result. If the conductivity\r\nof the deeper and denser material is appreciably greater than that\r\nof the more superficial and less dense material, as seems probable,\r\nthis effect is intensified. The distribution of compressibility at\r\nthe existing state of condensation may possibly be such that more\r\nnew heat is generated by shrinkage in the outer parts than in the\r\ninner. Neither of these conceptions can be affirmed as actually taking\r\nplace. They merely lie within the range of reasonable hypothesis in\r\nthe present state of experimental data. What the real truth is must be\r\nleft to further research. Present effort may be regarded as temporarily\r\nsuccessful if it forms consistent conceptions of the applicable\r\nhypotheses, and of their consequences.\r\n\r\n=Recombination of material.=—One other peculiarity of the accretion\r\nhypothesis must be recalled here. The incoming bodies must probably be\r\nassumed to have fallen in promiscuous order, and hence to have been\r\nindiscriminately mingled in the growing earth. As they became buried\r\ndeeper and deeper and their temperatures and pressures were raised,\r\nmuch recombination, chemical and physical, may be presumed to have\r\nfollowed. As already noted, these changes would probably give increased\r\ndensity in the main. The material being, however, in a solid state, the\r\nrearrangement would be slow and its persistence in time indeterminate,\r\nand it may yet be far from complete. It is not improbable, therefore,\r\nunder this hypothesis, that some notable part of the recent shrinkage\r\nof the earth has been due to the continued rearrangement of its\r\nheterogeneous internal matter. This would not be equally so in an\r\nearth derived from a molten mass, for the required adjustments of\r\nthe material should have taken place while in the fluid state before\r\nsolidification.\r\n\r\n=Comparison of the hypotheses.=—By comparing the three hypotheses of\r\nthe early states of the earth’s temperature, it will be seen that\r\nthere is a radical difference, thermally, between the first and\r\nthe last two. The first assumes a nearly uniform distribution of\r\ninternal temperature, and hence, owing to the exceedingly slow rate\r\nof conduction, limits the movements and deformations of the crust, so\r\nfar as dependent on heat, to very superficial horizons. The second\r\nand third views agree in postulating changes of temperature in the\r\ndeep portions, as well as in the superficial, and hence involve the\r\ncentral portion of the earth in the great movements and deformations.\r\nIt is not to be supposed that this of itself necessarily increases the\r\nsum-total of the effects of contraction, for, given a certain loss of\r\nheat from the surface, it may be relatively immaterial whether this\r\nloss arose from a large reduction of temperature in a shallow zone, or\r\na small reduction of temperature in a deep zone, for, except as the\r\ncoefficient of expansion varies, the total shrinkage would be the same.\r\nBut _the difference in distribution_ makes a radical difference in the\r\nresulting movements, for, in the first case, the movements are in a\r\nweak superficial shell that cannot accumulate great stresses, and hence\r\nmust yield practically as fast as the stresses arise, while, in the\r\nsecond case, the stress-accumulating power of the thick segments may be\r\ngreat, and the stresses may gather for long periods and give rise to\r\ngreat cumulative results at long intervals. In this respect the last\r\ntwo views have much in common, though they differ in other important\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nWith this general background of hypothesis, we may now turn to the\r\ndirect evidences of the distribution of internal temperature which\r\nobservations near the surface afford. Unfortunately they are limited to\r\na mere film, as it were, little more than ¹⁄₄₀₀₀ of the radius of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 OBSERVED TEMPERATURES IN EXCAVATIONS.\r\n\r\nAs the earth is penetrated below the zone of seasonal changes by wells,\r\nmines, tunnels, and other excavations, the temperature is almost\r\ninvariably found to rise. The rate of rise, however, is far from\r\nuniform. If we set aside as exceptional the unusually rapid rise near\r\nvolcanoes and in other localities of obvious igneous influence, the\r\nhighest rates are still six times the lowest. A large number of records\r\nhave been collated by the Committee on Underground Temperatures, of the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science. These range from\r\n1° F. in less than 20 feet to 1° F. in 130 feet, with an average of 1°\r\nF. in 50 to 60 feet, which has usually been taken as representative.\r\nThe more recent deep borings that have been carefully measured with due\r\nregard to sources of error indicate a slower rate of rise. Some of the\r\nmore notable records are as follows:[1]\r\n\r\n                                                Depth.

Very notable variations are found in the same mine or well, and\r\noften much difference is found in adjacent records, especially those of\r\nartesian wells. Some of these are explainable, but the full meaning of\r\nother variations is yet to be found.\r\n\r\n=Explanations of varying increment.=—Certain apparent variations are\r\nmerely due to _inequalities of topography_. The isogeotherms, or planes\r\nof equal underground temperature, do not normally rise and fall with\r\nevery local irregularity of the surface, but more nearly strike an\r\naverage. A well on a bluff 500 feet high would probably reach nearly\r\nthe same temperature at 1000 feet, as a well 500 feet deep in the\r\nadjacent valley, giving a gradient twice as great in the one case as in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn interpreting the temperatures of artesian flows, regard must be\r\nhad to the _depths of rock under which the waters have passed_, as\r\nwell as the depths at the location of the wells. Darton has found[258]\r\nunusually high and varying temperatures in the artesian wells of the\r\nDakotas, some part of which may be due to this cause, though a full\r\nexplanation of their singular variations is not yet reached.\r\n\r\n=The permeation and circulation of water= affect the temperature in two\r\nimportant ways: (1) wet rocks are better conductors than dry ones, and\r\n(2) the convective movement of water is a means of conveying heat from\r\nlower to higher horizons. As the circulation of underground water is\r\nvery unequal, much irregularity of thermal distribution in the upper\r\nzones probably arises from this source. The _general_ effect of water\r\ncirculation is to reduce the thermal gradient where the circulation\r\nis relatively rapid, as it is near the surface and in the main\r\nthoroughfares of circulation, and hence to cause a relatively rapid\r\nrise in the gradient just below the zone of effective water influence.\r\nSome records conform to this theoretical deduction, but in general it\r\nis masked by other influences.\r\n\r\n=Chemical action=, especially oxidation, carbonation, hydration,\r\nsolution, and precipitation, modify the normal temperature gradient,\r\nbut how effectively is not well determined. With little doubt the\r\nfirst three mentioned above raise the temperature, while solution\r\nand precipitation in some large measure offset each other.[259] The\r\nsum-total is probably an appreciable rise in temperature. It has even\r\nbeen conjectured that the heat of volcanic action is due to chemical\r\ncombination in the lower reaches of water circulation, but this is\r\nobviously an over-estimate.\r\n\r\n=Differences in the conductivity of rock= are an obvious source of\r\nvarying underground temperature gradients. If an outer formation\r\nconducts heat more freely than those below, it tends to lower the\r\ngradient within itself and to cause a relative rise in the gradient\r\njust below. If a lower formation is more conductive than that above, it\r\ntends to lower the gradient within itself, and to raise it in the one\r\nabove, because it carries heat to the outer one faster than the latter\r\ncarries it away.\r\n\r\nThe =compression= to which rocks have been subjected affects their\r\ntemperature. At the surface the variation from this source is chiefly\r\ndependent on the lateral thrust suffered.\r\n\r\nWhen allowances are made for all these and other known causes of local\r\nvariation of temperature, it is still not clear that a uniform average\r\ngradient remains as the true conception. If the earth were once a\r\nmolten spheroid, there would be a strong presumption that, aside from\r\nlocal variations, there would be a normal curve applicable to all\r\nregions. On the other hand, if the internal heat has arisen chiefly\r\nfrom compression, and if the compression has varied in different\r\nregions, as the inequalities of the surface render probable, there\r\nwould be no such definite normal curve in the accessible zone of the\r\nearth, but rather a varying rate in different regions. In either case,\r\nthe later movements, compressions and strains of the crust, must modify\r\nthe original thermal gradients.\r\n\r\n=Gradients projected.=—It is not probable that these gradients, even\r\nwhen corrected for local variations, continue unmodified to the\r\ncenter of the earth. If they did, 1° F. in 60 feet continued to the\r\nearth’s center would give 348,000° F., and 1° F. in 100 feet would\r\ngive 209,000° F. It is much more probable that the rates of rise fall\r\naway below the superficial zone. If water circulation in the fracture\r\nzone is the most efficient agency cooperating with conductivity in the\r\noutward conveyance of heat, as seems probable, the gradient in that\r\nzone should rise at an abnormal rate, and hence the average gradient\r\nin the deeper portions not affected by this circulation should be\r\nlower. It will be recalled that the central temperature deduced from\r\nan extension of Barus’ fusion curve is 136,800° F. (76,000° C.),\r\nwhich, high as it is, gives a lower average gradient than the surface\r\nobservations. The computations from compression by Lunn, giving a\r\ncentral temperature of 36,000° F. (20,000° C.), imply a still lower\r\naverage rate, while the convection hypothesis postulates no sensible\r\nincrease at all below 200 or 300 miles.\r\n\r\n----------------+------------------+-------------+-----+-----------+----------\r\nAverage material|                  |   Mineral   |     |           |\r\n    of crust    |  Norm minerals   |  equivalent |     |  Linear   | Volume\r\n   (Clarke’s    | calculated from  |  (C.I.P.W.  |Axis.| expansion.|expansion.\r\n tables).[260]  |Clarke’s average. |   system).  |     |           |\r\n----------------+------------------+-------------+-----+-----------+----------\r\nSiO₂      58.59 |Quartz        11.4|Quartz       |     |+.00001206 |.00003618\r\nAl₂O₃     15.04 |Orthoclase    17.2|             | _a_ |+.00001906 |\r\nFe₂O₃      3.94 |Albite        27.3|Anorthite    | _b_ |-.000002035|\r\nFeO        3.48 |Anorthite     17.8|             | _c_ |-.000001495|.00001553\r\nCaO        5.29 |Diopside       6.8|             | _a_ |+.000008125|\r\nMgO        4.49 |Hypersthene   10.2|Diopside     | _b_ |+.000016963|.0000234\r\nK₂O        2.90 |Magnetite and     |             | _c_ |-.000001707|\r\nNa₂O       3.20 | Ilmenite      6.8|Augite       | _a_ |+.000013856|\r\nTiO₂        .55 |Minor             | (used for   |     |           |\r\n                | constituents     | hypersthene)|     |           |\r\nMinor           | omitted       2.5|             |     |           |\r\n  constituents  |            ——————|             | _b_ |+.00000272 |.0000245\r\n  omitted  2.52 |            100.00|Magnetite    | _c_ |+.00000791 |\r\n         —————— |                  |             |     |+.000009540|.00002862\r\n         100.00 |                  |             |     |           |\r\n----------------+------------------+-------------+-----+-----------+----------\r\n\r\n=The amount of loss of heat.=—The amount of loss of interior heat\r\nwhich the earth suffers may be estimated by that which is observed to\r\nbe passing outward through the rock, or by computing the amount which\r\nshould be conveyed outwards with the estimated gradients and with the\r\nconductivity of rock as determined by experiment. The latter method\r\nis usually employed in general problems. Taking the mean thermometric\r\nconductivity of rock as 0.0045, the gradient as 1° C. in 30 meters,\r\nthe average specific heat of rock as 0.5 small calories per cubic\r\ncentimeter, it is computed that in 100,000,000 years the loss of heat\r\nwould amount to 45° C. (81° F.) for the whole body of the earth.[261]\r\nTait makes the more conservative estimate of 10° C. (18° F.) in the\r\nsame period.[262] This is an exceedingly small result, and emphasizes\r\nthe low conductivity of rock.\r\n\r\n=The amount of shrinkage from loss of heat.=—To compute the amount of\r\nshrinkage for a given amount of cooling, the average coefficient of\r\nexpansion of rock is required. This has been experimentally determined\r\nby several investigators. By combining the determinations of others\r\nwith his own, T. Mellard Reade found the _linear_ coefficient to be\r\n.000005257 per 1° F., equivalent to .00002838 per 1° C. per _volume_.\r\nIn this the proportions of the different rocks in the crust were\r\nroughly estimated. To secure an independent result from the best\r\navailable estimate of what constitutes the average rock, W. H. Emmons\r\nhas reduced Clarke’s average of the chemical constituents of the\r\ncrust to the norm minerals under the new system of Cross, Iddings,\r\nPirsson, and Washington (see p. 454) and made a weighted average of the\r\nconductivities of these, as shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------\r\n                |           |         |  Volume   |   Volume\r\n                |Percentages| Sp.

(18° F.), (Tait’s estimate), is a little over a quarter\r\nof a mile (.2572); and for a loss of 45° C. (81° F.), (estimate of\r\nDaniell’s Physics), a little over a mile (1.1574). The shortening of\r\nthe circumference for 10° C. loss is 1.6 miles, and for 45° C., 7.27\r\nmiles. Computations based on the coefficient of expansion adopted by\r\nReade give 2.35 miles circumferential shortening for a loss of 10° C.\r\nand 10.5 miles for a loss of 45° C. In both these cases, the whole\r\ncontraction is assumed to take a vertical direction, and hence these\r\nare maximum results. They are exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nUnless there is a very serious error in the estimated rate of thermal\r\nloss, or in the coefficients of expansion, cooling would seem to be a\r\nvery inadequate cause for the shrinkage which the mountain foldings,\r\noverthrust faults, and other deformations imply. This inadequacy has\r\nbeen strongly urged by Fisher[264] and by Dutton.[265] In view of the\r\napparent incompetency of external loss of heat, the possibilities of\r\ndistortion from other causes invite consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OTHER SOURCES OF DEFORMATION.\r\n\r\n=Transfer of internal heat.=—It is theoretically possible that\r\ndeformation of the subcrust may result from the internal transfer of\r\nheat without regard to external loss. It has already been shown (p.\r\n539) that under certain possible conditions more heat would flow from\r\nthe inner parts to higher horizons than would be conveyed through\r\nthese latter to the surface and there lost, and that, as a result,\r\nthe temperatures of the inner parts might be falling, while those of\r\nthe outer parts (except the surface) might be rising. With the more\r\nconservative coefficient of expansion previously given, a lowering of\r\nthe average temperature of the inner half of the earth 500° C. and the\r\nraising, by transfer, of the outer half to an equal amount would give a\r\nlateral thrust of about 83 miles, which is about the order of magnitude\r\nthought to be needed. It is not affirmed that this takes place, but\r\nsome transfer of this kind is among the theoretical possibilities under\r\nthe accretion hypothesis. The process could not continue indefinitely;\r\nbut, for aught that can now be affirmed, it may still be in progress.\r\n\r\n=Denser aggregation of matter.=—As already noted, matter under intense\r\npressure tends to aggregate itself in the forms that give the greatest\r\ndensity. If the earth were built up of heterogeneous matter arranged at\r\nhaphazard, the material would probably readjust itself more or less,\r\nas time went on, into combinations of greater and greater density.\r\nThis process may be one of the important sources of shrinkage, for an\r\naverage change of density of 1 percent., affecting the matter of the\r\nwhole globe, would probably meet all the demands of deformation since\r\nthe beginning of the Paleozoic period.\r\n\r\n=Extravasation of lavas.=—It is obvious that if lavas are forced out\r\nfrom beneath the crust and spread upon it, a compensating sinking of\r\nthe crust will follow. This, however, is rather a mode than an ulterior\r\ncause, for a cause must be found for the extrusion of the lavas, and\r\nthis cause may be one of the other agencies recognized, such as a\r\ntransfer of heat, a reorganization of matter, or a change of pressure.\r\nThe more practical question, however, relates to its competency. Can\r\nthe amount of lava that has been extruded have had any very appreciable\r\neffect on the descent of the crust? The great Deccan flow is credited\r\nwith an area of 200,000 square miles, and a thickness of 4000 to 6000\r\nfeet. Vast as this is for a lava-flow, it would form a layer only\r\nabout 5 feet thick when spread over the whole surface of the globe,\r\nand hence the sinking to replace it would cause a lateral thrust, on\r\nany great circle, of about 31 feet only. It requires a very generous\r\nestimate of the lavas poured out between any two great mountain-making\r\nperiods since the beginning of the well-known stratigraphic series to\r\ncause a horizontal thrust of any appreciable part of that involved\r\nin mountain-making. The case is different, however, if we go back to\r\nthe Archean era, in which the proportion of extrusive and intrusive\r\nrocks is very high. Very notable distortion may then be assigned to\r\nthe extravasation of lavas. The outward movement of lava must also be\r\ncredited with some transfer of heat from lower to higher horizons, and\r\nthis is probably one of the agencies that have produced the relatively\r\nhigh underground temperatures in the outer part of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf lavas are thrust into crevices of the crust they contribute to its\r\nextension, but causes for the crevices and for the intrusion must be\r\nfound, and these are probably only expressions of one or another of the\r\nmore general agencies.\r\n\r\n=Change in the rate of rotation.=—As previously noted, the tide acts\r\nas a brake on the rotation of the earth. The oblateness of the present\r\nearth is accommodated to its present rate of rotation. It is assumed\r\nthat such accommodation has always obtained, and that if the rotation\r\nhas changed, the form of the earth has changed also. Now, the more\r\noblate the spheroid, the larger its surface shell and the less the\r\ntotal force of gravity. Hence if the earth’s rotation has diminished,\r\nits crust must have shrunk, because the form of the spheroid has\r\nbecome more compact, and the increase of gravity has increased its\r\ndensity. There is at present a water-tide chiefly generated in the\r\nsouthern ocean, and irregularly distributed to more northerly waters.\r\nThis irregularity interferes with its systematic action as a brake,\r\nand its average effects are difficult of estimation. The water-tides\r\nof past ages are still more uncertain, as they must have depended on\r\nthe configuration and continuity of the oceans. There are geological\r\ngrounds for the belief that the southern ocean was interrupted by land\r\nduring portions of the past at least, and it is unknown whether there\r\nwere elsewhere ocean-belts well suited to the generation of large\r\ntides. The ocean-tide, therefore, furnishes a very uncertain basis\r\nfor estimating the retardation of rotation.[266] The theoretical case\r\nrests largely on the assumption of an effective body-tide. The earth\r\ndoubtless has some body-tide, but whether it is sufficiently great to\r\nbe effective, and whether its position, which depends on its promptness\r\nin yielding and in resilience, is favorable to the retardation of\r\nrotation, are yet open questions. The existence of an appreciable\r\nbody-tide has not yet been proved by observation.\r\n\r\nG. H. Darwin, assuming that the earth is viscous enough to give a\r\nbody-tide of appreciable value and of effective position, has deduced\r\na series of former rates of rotation of the earth and has computed the\r\ncorresponding distances of the moon.[267] C. S. Slichter has shown that\r\nthe lessening of the area of the surface and the increase of the force\r\nof gravity corresponding to these assigned changes of rotation are\r\nlarge, and that if the changes were actually experienced they must have\r\ninvolved much distortion of the crust.[268] These distortions would,\r\nhowever, be of a peculiar nature, and should thereby be detectible, if\r\nthey were realized; for in passing from a more oblate to a less oblate\r\nspheroid, the equatorial belt shrinks, and the polar tracts rise and\r\nbecome more convex. Wrinkles should, therefore, mark the equatorial\r\nbelts, and tension the high latitudes. Slichter has computed that in\r\na change from a rotation period of 3.82 hours to the present one, the\r\nequatorial belt must shorten 1131 miles and the meridional circles\r\nlengthen 495 miles. If we take Heim’s estimate of the crust-shortening\r\ninvolved in forming the Alps—74 miles—as a standard, the 1131 miles\r\nof equatorial shortening would be sufficient for the formation of 15\r\nmountain ranges of Alpine magnitude. If, as some geologists urge, the\r\nestimate of mountain folding is too great, the quotient would be still\r\nlarger. These ranges should run across the equator and be limited to\r\nabout 33° N. and S. latitude. The high-latitude tension would be\r\nsufficient to cause the earth to gape more than two hundred miles at\r\nthe poles, if there were simple ideal shrinkage. The amounts and the\r\ndistribution of thrust and shrinkage are shown in Fig. 453. If the\r\nchange of rotation were no more than from 14 hours to the present rate,\r\nthere would still be 52 miles of thrust in the equatorial belt, and\r\n40 miles of shortage in the meridional circles. There are no clear\r\nsigns of such a remarkable distribution of thrust and tension as this\r\nhypothesis requires. Mountains are about as abundant and as strong\r\nnorth of 33°, the neutral line, as south of it, and they extend to\r\nhigh latitudes. The Archean rocks, in which this agency should have\r\nbeen most effective because of their early formation, are crumpled\r\nand crushed in the high latitudes much the same as in low latitudes.\r\nFurthermore, if there had been appreciable change in the form of the\r\nearth to accommodate itself to a slower rotation, the water on the\r\nsurface, being the most mobile element, should have gathered toward\r\nthe poles, and the less mobile solid earth should have protruded about\r\nthe equator, but the distribution of land and water, present and past,\r\ngives no clear evidence of this. The equatorial belt contains a less\r\npercentage of land than the area north of it and more than that south\r\nof it. It varies but slightly from the average for the whole globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 453.—Polar projection of the earth’s hemisphere\r\n  showing the theoretical high-latitude tension and low-latitude\r\n  compression involved in a change of rotation from 3.82 hours to\r\n  the present rate. The figure is drawn to true scale as seen from\r\n  a point above the pole, and in consequence the equatorial tract\r\n  is foreshortened. The black triangles show compression reduced in\r\n  length by foreshortening; the white show tension in essentially true\r\n  proportions to the high-latitude areas. The neutral line between the\r\n  areas of compression and of stretching lies at 33° 20′ latitude.]\r\n\r\nWhile the doctrine of tidal retardation is theoretically sound, and\r\nwhile the relations of the moon to the earth have probably been\r\nappreciably affected by tidal action, geological evidence indicates\r\nthat it has not been sufficiently effective in producing crustal\r\ndeformations to be clearly detected by its own distinctive results.\r\nThis may be due (1) to the fact that there are compensating agencies\r\nthat tend to acceleration of rotation, and (2) to the probable fact\r\nthat the central rigidity of the earth is too high to give a very\r\neffective body-tide. Hence the process of retardation may have been too\r\nslow to have been geologically appreciable in the known period. The\r\nrecent estimates of the effective rigidity of the earth are greater\r\nthan former ones, and they may need to be modified yet further in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of rigidity.=—An important consideration in this\r\nconnection is the distribution of interior rigidity. It is certain\r\nthat the rigidity of the outermost part, taken as a mass, is somewhat\r\nless than that of rock of an average surface type, for it is fissured,\r\nand there is no reason to suppose that the rigidity of the rock next\r\nbelow the fissure zone rises at once to the rigidity of steel, and\r\nhence if the average rigidity of the whole earth is equal to that of\r\nsteel, a portion of the interior must have a rigidity much higher than\r\nsteel. There is probably some law of increase from surface to center,\r\nand there are theoretical grounds for thinking that it is in some way\r\nconnected with the laws of pressure, density, compressibility, and\r\ntemperature. All of these factors probably affect rigidity, but in\r\ndifferent ways. The modulus of rigidity of steel is about 770 × 10⁶\r\ngrms. per sq. cm. Milne and Gray[269] found that of granite to be 128 ×\r\n10⁶. The ratio of the rigidity of steel to that of rock is, therefore,\r\nabout 6 : 1. If it be assumed that the rigidity increases in depth\r\ndirectly as the density, the rigidity will nowhere reach that of steel,\r\nbeing only about two-thirds as much at the center. If it be assumed\r\nthat the rigidity increases as the squares of the density ratios, the\r\nfollowing values are obtained:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------+---------+----------+------------\r\n  Distances from |                |         | Density  |\r\n  center in terms| Densities under| Density |  ratios  |  Deduced\r\n   of radius.    |  Laplace’s law.| ratios. | squared. | rigidities.\r\n  ---------------+----------------+---------+----------+------------\r\n       1.00      |      2.8       |    1    |    1     | 0.16 Steel\r\n        .75      |      5.7       |    2    |    4     | 0.6    „\r\n        .50      |      8.39      |    3    |    9     | 1.5    „\r\n        .25      |     10.27      |    3.7  |   13.7   | 2.3    „\r\n        .00      |     10.95      |    3.9  |   15.2   | 2.5    „\r\n\r\nThese values seem fairly consistent with the apparent requirements of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution of rigidity were of this nature, the _average_\r\nrigidity would be much less than that of steel, for more than half\r\nthe volume lies in the outer division, between 1.00 and .75 radius,\r\nand yet the effective resistance to tidal deformation would be high,\r\nfor, according to G. H. Darwin,[270] the tidal stress-differences are\r\neight times as great in the center as at the surface. The rigidity\r\nwould, therefore, be distributed so as to be much more effective\r\nin resistance than if it were uniform. The suggestion arises here\r\nthat the tidal stresses and other analogous stresses arising from\r\nastronomical sources may be in themselves the causes of some such\r\ndistribution of rigidity as this. The tidal stresses are rhythmical\r\nand give rise to a kind of kneading of the body of the earth, small in\r\nmeasure to be sure, but persistent and rapidly recurrent. Since these\r\nstress-differences at the center are eight times those at the surface,\r\nand since also the gravitative stress at the center is 3,000,000 times\r\nthat at the surface, there is a series of persistently recurring\r\nstress-differences, greatest at the center and declining outwards,\r\nsuperposed on enormous static stresses, also intensest at the center\r\nand declining outwards. Now, if the earth material were once made up\r\nof a mixture of minerals of different fusibility, some of which became\r\nmore mobile (whether fluid or viscous) than others under the rising\r\ntemperature of the interior, it seems that the more mobile portion must\r\nhave tended to move from the regions of greater stress-differences to\r\nthose of lesser stress-differences. The persistence and the rhythmical\r\nnature of the tidal stress-differences seem well suited to aid the\r\nmobile parts in gradually working their way outwards. At the same time\r\nthe more solid and resistant portions should remain behind, and thus\r\ncome to constitute the dominant material of the central regions where\r\nstress-differences were greatest, and so, as it were, concentrate\r\nrigidity there. The process may still be in action.\r\n\r\nIf it be assumed that the rhythmical stresses have thus developed a\r\nresistance to deformation proportional to their intensity, we may\r\ncombine this with density to form the basis of another hypothetical\r\ndistribution of rigidity, as follows:\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-----------+---------+----------------+------------\r\n  Distances from | Densities | Density | Ratios adjusted|\r\n  center in terms|   under   | ratios. |    to stress   |  Deduced\r\n   of radius.    | Laplace´s |         |   differences. | rigidities.\r\n                 |    Law.   |         |      (1:8)     |\r\n  ---------------+-----------+---------+----------------+------------\r\n       1.00      |    2.8    |    1    |       1        |  0.16 Steel\r\n        .75      |    5.7    |    2    |       3.5      |  0.58   „\r\n        .50      |    8.39   |    3    |       5.4      |  0.90   „\r\n        .25      |    10.27  |    3.7  |       7        |  1.16   „\r\n        .00      |    10.95  |    3.9  |       8        |  1.33   „\r\n\r\nThe average rigidity is here also much less than that of steel, but its\r\ndistribution is such as to render it ideally fitted to resist tidal\r\ndistortion.\r\n\r\nThese hypothetical distributions of rigidity have no claims to special\r\nvalue in themselves, for the grounds on which they are based are quite\r\ninadequate, but they are not without importance in giving tangible form\r\nto considerations that bear vitally not only on tidal problems, but on\r\nmany others connected with the internal constitution and dynamics of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Sphericity as a factor in deformation._\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if the earth shrinks, its crust must become too\r\nlarge for the reduced spheroid, and must be compressed or distorted\r\nto fit the new form. The amount of distortion required for any given\r\nshrinkage is easily computed from the ratio of the radius to the\r\ncircumference of a sphere, which is approximately 1 : 6.28. If, for\r\nexample, the radius shortens 5 miles, each great circle must on the\r\naverage be compressed, wrinkled, or otherwise distorted to the extent\r\nof about 31 miles, or, in reversed application, if the mountain\r\nfoldings on any great circle together show a shortening of 100 miles,\r\nthe appropriate radial shortening is 16 miles. The ratio of 1 : 6+\r\nfurnishes a convenient check on hypotheses that assign specific thrusts\r\nto specific sinkings of adjacent segments. A segment 3000 miles across,\r\nfor example, such as the bottom of the North Atlantic basin, sinking\r\nthree miles, about the full depth of the basin, would give a lateral\r\nthrust of about 2.2 miles, a little over a mile on each side, a\r\ntrivial amount compared with the foldings on the adjacent continental\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n=The influence of the domed form of the surface.=—Because of the\r\nspheroidal form of the earth, each portion of the crust is ideally an\r\narch or dome. When broad areas like the continents are considered, it\r\nis the dome rather than the arch that is involved, and in this the\r\nthrust is ideally toward all parts of the periphery. It is probably for\r\nthis reason that mountain ranges so often follow curved or angulated\r\nlines, or outline rude triangles or polygons. The sigmoidal courses\r\nof the ranges of southern Europe, the looped chains of the eastern\r\nborder of Asia, and the curved ranges of the Antillean region, are\r\nnotable examples. The border ranges of the Americas, of the Thibetan\r\nplateau, and of other great segments, illustrate the polygonal\r\ntendency. The general distribution of the great ranges is such that a\r\nnearly equal portion of crustal crumpling is thrown across each great\r\ncircle, as theory demands. The common generalization that mountain\r\nranges run chiefly in oblique directions, as northeast-southwest,\r\nnorthwest-southeast, is but a partial view of the more general fact\r\nthat the lines of distortion must lie in all directions to accommodate\r\nthe old crust to the new geoid, if there be equable contraction in all\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n=Theoretical strength of domes of earth-dimensions.=—As the domed form\r\nof the crust has played an important part in theories of deformation,\r\nit is important to form quantitative conceptions of the strength of\r\nideal domes having the figure and dimensions of segments of the earth’s\r\ncrust. According to Hoskins,[271] a dome corresponding perfectly to the\r\nsphericity of the earth, formed of firm crystalline rock of the high\r\ncrushing strength of 25,000 pounds to the square inch, and having a\r\nweight of 180 pounds to the cubic foot, would, if unsupported below,\r\nsustain _only ¹⁄₅₂₅ of its own weight_.[272] This result is essentially\r\nindependent of the extent of the dome, and also of its thickness,\r\nprovided the former is continental and the latter does not exceed a\r\nsmall fraction of the earth’s radius. If this ideal case be modified\r\nby supposing the central part of the spherical dome to rise above the\r\naverage surface, the supporting power will not be materially changed\r\nunless the central elevation is a considerable fraction of the radius\r\nof the dome. Assuming a central elevation of two miles—to represent\r\nthe protrusion of the continental segments—the results for domes of\r\ndifferent horizontal extent are as follows:[273]\r\n\r\n      THEORETICAL STRENGTH OF IDEAL DOMES ARCHED TWO MILES ABOVE\r\n                  THE AVERAGE SURFACE OF THE SPHERE.\r\n\r\n  +--------------+---------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | Diameter of  | Multiplier of ¹⁄₅₂₅  | Proportion of its own|\r\n  | given dome   | i.e. the supporting |  weight sustained by |\r\n  |arched 2 miles|  proportion of a    |  given dome arched   |\r\n  | above sphere.|   spherical dome.   | 2 miles above sphere.|\r\n  +--------------+---------------------+----------------------+\r\n  | 3,000 miles  |       1.006         |        1/522         |\r\n  |   400   ”    |       1.396         |        1/376         |\r\n  |   240   ”    |       2.11          |        1/249         |\r\n  |   160   ”    |       3.49          |        1/150         |\r\n  |    80   ”    |      10.97          |        1/48          |\r\n  +--------------+---------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nFrom this table it will be seen that for domes of continental\r\ndimensions the supporting strength _equals only a very small fraction\r\nof the dome’s own weight_. Increasing the thickness of the shell\r\nincreases its actual supporting power, but the proportion is somewhat\r\nless when the whole sphere is concerned. The problem has not been\r\nworked out for domes of limited extent. For rough estimates, where\r\nthe dimensions of the dome are of continental magnitude, each mile of\r\nthickness may be taken as supporting a layer of about 10 feet of its\r\nown material. If the hypothetical level of no stress be placed at 8\r\nmiles depth, the shell above this, by reason of its domed shape, could\r\nrelieve its own pressure on that below to an amount equal only to the\r\nweight of about 80 feet of rock over its surface, even if its form and\r\nstructure were ideal. If the shell were thick enough (817 miles) to\r\nembrace one-half the volume of the earth, its supporting power would\r\nbe a little more than the weight of one and one-half miles of rock. As\r\nthe radius of the earth is less than 4000 miles, the extreme supporting\r\npower reckoned on this basis would be only about 8 miles of rock-depth.\r\nIt is interesting, if not significant, to observe that this depth\r\nbarely reaches the minimum shrinkage that will serve, according to\r\ncurrent estimates, to account for the crustal shortening of the great\r\nmountain-making periods. It is as if the shrinkage stresses accumulated\r\nto the full extent of the stress-resisting power of the whole sphere,\r\nand then collapsed. It is not safe, however, to give much weight to\r\nthis coincidence, for higher densities and probably higher resistances\r\nto distortion come into play in the deeper horizons. If these\r\nresistances are proportional to the higher densities of the interior,\r\nthe deductions would remain the same. If the effective rigidity of the\r\nearth as a whole is that of steel, as deduced by Kelvin and Darwin\r\nfrom tidal and other observations, or twice that of steel, as inferred\r\nby Milne from the transmission of seismic vibrations, the supporting\r\npower of the body of the earth dependent on its sphericity would be\r\nappreciably higher.\r\n\r\nIt would seem clear from the foregoing considerations that something\r\nmore than the mere crust of the earth has been involved in the great\r\ndeformations. Indeed it is not clear that the fullest resources of\r\nstress-accumulation which the spheroidal form of the earth affords are\r\nsufficient to meet the demands of the problem, unless the rigidity of\r\nthe earth be taken at a much higher value than that of surface-rock,\r\nand this is perhaps an additional argument for the high rigidities\r\ninferred from tides and seismic waves.\r\n\r\nIn view of the doubtful competency of even the thickest segments to\r\naccumulate the requisite stresses, there is need to consider modes\r\nof differential stress-accumulation other than those dependent on\r\nsphericity.\r\n\r\n=Stress-accumulation independent of sphericity.=—The principle of the\r\ndome is brought into play whenever an interior shell shrinks away, or\r\ntends to shrink away, from an outer one which does not shrink. In this\r\ncase, there is a free outer surface and a more or less unsupported\r\nunder surface toward which motion is possible. The dome may, therefore,\r\nyield by crushing or by contortion. The computations given above are\r\nfor cases of this kind. But where the thickness becomes great and\r\nthe dome involves a large part or even all of a sector of the earth,\r\nfreedom of motion beneath is small, and to readjust the matter to a new\r\nform, strains must be developed widely throughout the sector, and must\r\ninvolve regions where the pressure is extremely great on all sides,\r\nand crushing in the usual sense impossible. Assuming the correctness\r\nof the modern doctrine that such pressure increases rigidity, instead\r\nof the older doctrine that it gives plasticity, it becomes reasonable\r\nto assume that stress-differences would be distributed throughout the\r\nmass, and bring into play a large portion of its stress-accumulating\r\ncompetency. When the mass yielded, it would not be by crushing, but by\r\n“flowage,” which would be more or less general throughout the mass.\r\nIt might, however, be partially concentrated, as, for example, on the\r\nborders of sectors of different specific gravity.\r\n\r\nStress-differences may arise from physical changes within the rock\r\nitself. Whenever there is a re-aggregation of matter, or a change\r\nof any kind which involves change of volume, a change of stress\r\nis liable to be involved. It may be of the nature of relief or of\r\nintensification. In an earth built up by the haphazard infall of\r\nmatter, a very heterogeneous mass must result, and the subsequent\r\nchanges may be supposed to be intimately distributed through the\r\nmass, being slight at any point, but present at innumerable points.\r\nAn immeasurable number of small stress-differences may, therefore, be\r\ndeveloped throughout the mass. Until these overmatch the effective\r\nstrength of the mass, they may continue to accumulate. These are not\r\nnecessarily connected with stresses that arise from sphericity, and may\r\nwork more or less independently of them. It is not improbable that the\r\ngreat stress-accumulating power of the globe finds an essential part of\r\nits explanation in supplemental considerations of this kind, and not\r\nwholly in its spheroidal form.\r\n\r\n=The actual configuration of the surface.=—The foregoing computations\r\nrelative to the power of shells of the earth to sustain pressures\r\nare based on ideal forms and structures that are not realized in\r\nfact. How far the earth fails to conform to these conditions must\r\nnow be considered. When compared with the earth as a whole, the\r\ninequalities of its surface are trivial. If the great dynamic forces\r\nacted through the whole or the larger part of the body of the earth,\r\nthe configuration of the surface can be supposed to have done little\r\nmore than influence the location of the surface deformations and their\r\nspecial phases. But if the forces were limited to a crust of moderate\r\nthickness, the configuration of the surface is a matter of radical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n=Concave tracts.=—There is need, therefore, to inquire if any\r\nconsiderable breadth of the crust is outwardly plane or concave, for\r\nthe principle of the dome is obviously not applicable to a plane or\r\nconcave surface. To be a source of fatal weakness, the concavity must\r\nbe broad enough to cause the planes of equal cooling, the isogeotherms,\r\nto be concave to considerable depths. For example, if the hypothetical\r\nlevel of no stress is eight miles below the surface, as computed on\r\ncertain assumptions, the concave portion must be so broad that the\r\nisogeotherms will also be concave outward at something near that\r\ndepth; in other words, the main part of the zone of thrust must be\r\nconcave. A narrow concavity at the surface, such as an ordinary valley\r\nin a portion of the crust that has the average convexity, would not\r\nseriously depress the isogeotherms, or affect the zone of thrust, but\r\na valley several times eight miles (level of no stress) in breadth\r\nwould. For inspecting the surface of the earth in this regard, it is\r\nconvenient to know what amounts of fall below the level surface give\r\na true plane for given distances. These are shown in the following\r\ntable:[274]\r\n\r\n  +--------+---------------------------+----------------+\r\n  |        | Length of normal to chord | Average fall of|\r\n  | Length |    at middle point in     | true plane from|\r\n  | of arc |------------+--------------+ level plane per|\r\n  |   in   |            |              |  mile, in feet.|\r\n  | miles. |    Feet.   |   Fathoms.   |   Greater fall |\r\n  |        |            |              |gives concavity.|\r\n  +--------+---------------------------+----------------+\r\n  |   25   |     100.3  |      16.7    |        8.      |\r\n  |   50   |     432.   |      72.     |        17.3    |\r\n  |   75   |     913.4  |     152.2    |        24.3    |\r\n  |  100   |    1,684.  |     280.7    |        33.7    |\r\n  |  150   |    3,748.8 |     624.8    |        49.9    |\r\n  |  200   |    6,674.  |    1,112.3   |        66.7    |\r\n  |  250   |   10,369.9 |    1,728.3   |        82.9    |\r\n  |  300   |   14,942.  |    2,490.3   |        99.6    |\r\n  |  400   |   26,664.  |    4,444.    |       133.3    |\r\n  |  500   |   41,659.  |    6,943.    |       166.6    |\r\n  +--------+---------------------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nApplying these criteria to the surface of the lithosphere, _it is found\r\nthat concave tracts from 100 to 300 miles in breadth are not uncommon_.\r\nThe more notable of these are shown in black on the accompanying map,\r\nFig. 454, and two typical ones are shown in cross-section in Figs.\r\n455 and 456. It is to be observed that concave tracts border the\r\ncontinents very generally. They are connected with the descent from\r\nthe continental shelf to the abysmal basins, and are unsymmetrical.\r\nNotable concavities are found in some of the great valleys on the\r\ncontinental platforms. The basins of Lake Superior, Michigan, Huron,\r\nand Ontario are in part concave; so are Puget Sound, the Adriatic,\r\nand the Dead Sea; so also are the valleys of California, of the Po,\r\nand of the Ganges, when the adjacent mountains are included. Some of\r\nthe “deeps” of the bottom of the ocean are notably concave. Fig.\r\n455, a cross-section of the Challenger Deep, _drawn to true scale and\r\nconvexity_, shows the nature of the phenomenon. The breadth is here\r\n300 miles, and the depression below a true plane is 11,400 feet. The\r\nlower line of the figure shows the approximate position and form of the\r\nnormal isogeotherm about ten miles below the surface. Assuming equal\r\nconductivity in all parts, it is clear that the isogeotherms must be\r\nconcave upwards for a considerable distance below ten miles. Unless\r\nthe shell of thrust is much more than ten miles thick, these concave\r\nportions should yield as fast as cooling below them permits, and _no\r\nstresses arising from convexity could be accumulated_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 454.—Map of the world, showing in black the chief\r\n  submarine concavities of the lithosphere.

(Prepared by W. H. Emmons.)]\r\n\r\nThese concavities of surface are so extensive and so widely distributed\r\nover the globe that _no part of the outer shell can be supposed to\r\nbe capable of accumulating notable stresses_ unless rigidly attached\r\nto the earth-body below. In other words, so far as sphericity is\r\nconcerned, the crust must ease all its stresses nearly as fast as they\r\naccumulate, if, as usually assumed, it rests on a contracting or mobile\r\nsubstratum.\r\n\r\nSurface cooling under these conditions should give only feeble thrusts,\r\ndeveloped and eased nearly constantly. Such movements should be\r\nadmirably adapted to give those gentle, nearly constant subsidences\r\nthat furnish the nice adjustments of water-depth required for the\r\naccumulation of thick strata in shallow water, and those slow upward\r\nwarpings that renew the feeding-grounds of erosion, the necessary\r\ncomplement of the deposition. These gentle, nearly constant movements\r\nmark every stage of geological history, and constitute one of its\r\ngreatest though least obtrusive features. _But if superficial stresses\r\narising in this way are eased in producing these effects, they cannot\r\naccumulate to cause the great periodic movements._\r\n\r\nEven where the crust is not concave, it is so warped and so traversed\r\nby folds and fault-planes that its resistance to thrust is relatively\r\nlow, and it should, therefore, warp easily and at many points, if the\r\nthrust be confined to a superficial crust.\r\n\r\n=General conclusion.=—When to the weakness of the crust, as computed\r\nunder ideal conditions, there is added the weakness inherent in these\r\nconcave and warped tracts, the conclusion seems imperative that while\r\nthe crust is the pliant subject of minor and nearly constant warpings,\r\nsuch as are everywhere implied in the stratigraphic series, it is\r\nwholly incompetent to be the medium of those great deformations\r\nwhich occur at long intervals and mark off the great eras of geologic\r\nhistory. These great deformations apparently involve the whole, or a\r\nlarge part, of the body of the earth, and seem to require a very high\r\nstate of effective rigidity.\r\n\r\n  =General references on crustal movements.=—Babbage, Jour.

The complementary processes of outward\r\nmovement now invite attention. Without doubt these are mainly but a\r\nresultant of the centripetal actions. For each pound of material moved\r\noutwards an equivalent is quite surely moved inwards. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, the outward movements have a peculiar nature of their own, and\r\nserve a function of radical importance in the economy of the globe.\r\nSome minor phases have been incidentally considered, such as the upward\r\nflow of springs and deep-seated waters, but here the descending and\r\nascending factors are alike, and are closely and obviously connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VULCANISM.\r\n\r\nThe great example of ascensive action is the movement of fluid rock\r\nfrom the interior outwards. The term vulcanism will be used to embrace\r\nnot only volcanic phenomena in the narrower sense, but all outward\r\nforcing of molten material, whether strictly extrusive or merely\r\nascensive.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of this ascensive action, taken as a whole, is simple.\r\nIn the effort at concentration under the powerful action of the\r\nearth’s gravity, the material of high specific gravity is urged more\r\nstrongly toward the center, volume for volume, than that of less\r\nspecific gravity, and as gravity is perpetually active, it follows that\r\nwhenever any movement, molecular or molar, takes place which permits a\r\nreadjustment of the positions of the two kinds of matter, the heavier\r\nsinks toward the center and the lighter rises, or at least tends to\r\ndo so. So also where there are stress-differences, the mobile matter\r\ntends to flow from the regions of greater stress toward those of lesser\r\nstress. In so far as any portion of the interior becomes liquid, it\r\nis free to move up or down according to the balance of stress brought\r\nto bear upon it, and adapts itself to any line of least resistance\r\navailable to it. As a natural result, therefore, the portion of the\r\ninterior which becomes fluid most largely participates in the outward\r\nmovement. In so far as molecular action permits a readjustment of\r\nmaterial, there is a tendency, even in the solid state, for the lighter\r\nmaterial to move upwards and the heavier downwards, and for the more\r\nstressed portions to move toward points of less stress; but this takes\r\nplace with extreme slowness. In so far as the materials of the interior\r\ndiffuse themselves through each other, the same laws hold good, but\r\nthey are modified by the special principles that control diffusion.\r\nThe outward diffusion of interior gases may be a factor of appreciable\r\nimportance, but this cannot be affirmed at present.\r\n\r\n=Phases of vulcanism.=—The forcing of fluid rock outward assumes two\r\ngeneral phases, which, however, merge into each other; and these\r\nmain phases take on various sub-phases. The first phase embraces\r\nthose outward movements of fluid rock which do not reach the surface.\r\nThe lavas, after ascending to the vicinity of the surface, intrude\r\nthemselves into the outer formations of the earth and congeal\r\nunderground (plutonic). The second phase embraces those outward\r\nmovements in which the fluid rock reaches the surface and gives rise\r\nto eruptive phenomena (volcanic). The first is _intrusive_, the\r\nsecond _extrusive_; the first constitutes _irruptions_, the second\r\n_eruptions_.[275] The fundamental nature of the two is the same, but\r\nthe extrusions usually take on special phases because of the relief\r\nof pressure at the surface of the earth, and because of the action of\r\nsurface-waters in contact with the heated lavas. Just where the lavas\r\ncome from, and how they find their way through the deep-lying compact\r\nzone below the zone of fracture, may better be considered later. When\r\nthey reach the zone of fracture, they usually either take advantage\r\nof fissures already formed, or force passageways for themselves by\r\nfracture. There is little evidence that they bore their way through\r\nthe rocks by melting, though they appear to round out their channels\r\nin some way into pipes, ducts, and other tubular forms when they flow\r\nthrough them for long periods of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           1. _Intrusions._\r\n\r\nFluid rock forced into fissures and solidified there forms _dikes_;\r\nforced into chimney-like passages, it forms _pipes_ or _plugs_;\r\ninsinuated between beds, it forms _sills_; bunched under strata\r\nso as to arch them upwards, it forms _laccoliths_; massed in great\r\naggregations underground, it constitutes _batholiths_, as already\r\ndescribed (pp. 394 and 500). Lavas sometimes crowd aside the adjacent\r\nrocks so far as to cause them to take a concentric form about the\r\nintruded mass. This is not uncommon in the oldest formations, and is\r\nprobably not infrequent in the deeper horizons where the pressures\r\nare very great. Some part of this may, however, be due to later\r\ndeformations. Nearer the surface, usually, the beds are merely lifted\r\nas in forming the sills, or are bowed upwards, as in the laccoliths, or\r\nfaulted as in _bysmaliths_ (p. 500).\r\n\r\n=The heating action= on the adjacent rock varies greatly with the\r\nmass and temperature of the intruded lava. Thin dikes and sills\r\noften produce little effect, while greater and hotter masses notably\r\nmetamorphose the adjacent rock. In some cases marked effects are due\r\nto a thin stream of lava flowing through a fissure for a long period,\r\nand so maintaining a high temperature. In the least effective cases,\r\nthe adjacent rock usually shows some signs of baking. In the marked\r\ncases, there is more or less new crystallization. The surrounding rock\r\ncommonly shows some evidence of material derived from the lavas; less\r\noften the lava shows some evidence of having received material from\r\nthe adjacent rock. But since the lavas do not usually bore their way\r\nthrough the strata in the zone of fracture, nor melt the adjacent rock,\r\nthe constitution of the lavas is not appreciably changed by the kinds\r\nof rock which they penetrate. On the other hand, the intrusions often\r\nshow the effects of rather rapid cooling by contact with the adjacent\r\nrock, (_a_) by a less coarse crystallization near the rock-walls, and\r\nsometimes (_b_) in a segregation of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           2. _Extrusions._\r\n\r\nWhen molten rock is forced to the surface it gives rise to the most\r\nintense and impressive of all geological phenomena. The energies\r\nacquired in the interior under great compression here find sudden\r\nrelief. Occluded gases often expand with extreme violence, hurling\r\nportions of the lavas to great heights and shattering them into\r\nfragments constituting “smoke,” ash, cinders, bombs, and other\r\npyroclastic material. Much of the explosive violence of volcanoes\r\nhas been attributed to the contact of surface-waters with the hot\r\nrising lava, but the function of this kind of action has probably been\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nThere are two phases of extrusion often quite strongly contrasted.\r\nThe one is explosive ejection, often attended with great violence;\r\nthe other, a quiet out-welling of the lava, with little more than\r\nebullition. More or less closely related to these differences are two\r\nclasses of conduits, (_a_) the one, great fissures, out of which the\r\nlava pours in great volume and spreads forth over wide tracts, often in\r\nbroad thin sheets; (_b_) the other, restricted openings, often pipes,\r\nducts, or limited fissures, from which the extrusion is usually much\r\nless abundant, and hence it more largely congeals near the orifice,\r\nforming cones. Flows from the former constitute massive eruptions;\r\nthose from the latter, the more familiar volcanic eruptions. There is\r\nno radical difference between them, and the two classes blend. The\r\nextent of the spreading of lava into thin sheets is due more to the\r\nmass and the fluidity than to the form of the outlet. The stupendous\r\noutflows of certain geologic periods appear to have issued mainly from\r\nextended fissures, doubtless because these better accommodated the\r\noutbursting floods.\r\n\r\n=_a._ Fissure eruptions.=—The chief known fissure eruptions of recent\r\ntimes are the vast basaltic floods of Iceland. Most of the eruptions\r\nof historic times are of the volcanic type; but at certain times in\r\nthe past there were prodigious outpourings, flow following flow until\r\nlayers thousands of feet thick covering thousands of square miles were\r\nbuilt up. One of these occurred in Tertiary times in Idaho, Oregon, and\r\nWashington, where some 200,000 square miles were covered with sheets\r\nof lava, aggregating in places 2000 feet or more in thickness. Earlier\r\nthan this, in Cretaceous times, there were enormous flows on the Deccan\r\nplateau of India, covering a like area to a depth of 4000 to 6000 feet.\r\nStill earlier than this, in Keweenawan times, an even more prolonged\r\nsuccession of lava-flows covered nearly all the area of the Lake\r\nSuperior basin, and extended beyond it, and built up a series of almost\r\nincredible thickness, the estimates reaching 15,000 to 25,000 feet.\r\nIn these cases there is little evidence of explosive or other violent\r\naction. There are few beds of ash, cinders, and similar pyroclastic\r\nmaterial. The inference is, therefore, that the lavas welled out rather\r\nquietly and spread themselves rather fluently over the surrounding\r\ncountry. For the most part these wide-spreading flows are composed of\r\nbasic material, which is more easily fusible and more highly fluent at\r\na given temperature than the acidic lavas. The latter are more disposed\r\nto form thick embossments near the point of extrusion.\r\n\r\nMassive outflows of this class constitute by far the greatest phenomena\r\nof the extrusive type, though they are not now the dominant type.\r\nIt has been sometimes thought that the more local volcanic type of\r\nextrusion followed the more massive fissure type as a phase of decline;\r\nbut this has not been substantiated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 457.—Lava-flow near the Jordan craters, Malheur\r\n  Co., Oregon. Though not of the gigantic order, it illustrates the\r\n  general aspect of massive lava-flows. (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=_b._ Volcanic eruptions.=—In the types of eruption prevailing at\r\nthe present time, the lavas are forced out through ducts or perhaps\r\nshort fissures or sections of fissures, and build up cones about the\r\nvents, the eruptive action maintaining craters in the centers of the\r\ncones. The essential feature of a volcano is the issuance of hot rock\r\nand gas from a local vent. A mountain is the usual result, but the\r\nmountain is secondary and not usually present in the first stages; the\r\nlocalized eruption is the primary and necessary factor. The amount of\r\nrock matter ejected is not necessarily great. Compared to the massive\r\nextrusions of fissure eruptions, it is usually rather trivial; but the\r\nvolcano makes up in demonstrativeness what it lacks in massiveness of\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 458.—The volcano Colima, Mexico, in eruption.\r\n  March 24, 1903. (José Maria Arreola, per Frederick Starr.)]\r\n\r\n_c._ =Intermediate phenomena.=—On the border-line between the intrusive\r\nand the extrusive phenomena there are special cases of interest. There\r\nappear to be certain instances in which the intrusion comes so near\r\nthe surface as to develop explosive phenomena without the extrusion\r\nof lava. From the nature of the case this is an interpretation rather\r\nthan a demonstration. It is certain, however, that occasional violent\r\nexplosions take place where no lava comes in sight. This sometimes\r\noccurs in old volcanic formations, and sometimes in regions of\r\nundisturbed horizontal strata. In the former case the phenomena may be\r\ndue to the intrusion of a fresh tongue of lava below, or it may be due\r\nto the penetration of surface-waters to hot rocks that have remained\r\nuncooled from previous volcanic action, and the development, by such\r\ncontact, of a volume of confined steam sufficient to produce the\r\nexplosion. A case of this doubtful kind occurred at Bandai-San in Japan\r\nin 1888, where there was a sudden and violent explosion which blew away\r\na considerable part of the side of a volcanic mountain which had not\r\nbeen in eruption for at least a thousand years. The mass and violence\r\nof the exploded material was such as to fill the air with ashes and\r\ndébris in a fashion altogether similar to a typical volcanic eruption.\r\nA large tract of adjacent country was devastated, and many lives lost.\r\nThe whole action, however, was concentrated in the initial explosion,\r\nand within a few hours the cloud of ashes had disappeared and the\r\nphenomenon was ended. An examination of the disrupted area revealed no\r\nsigns of liquid lava.\r\n\r\nAn example of the latter class is Coon Butte in Arizona.[276] This\r\nconsists of a rim of fragmental material encircling a crater-like pit\r\nfrom which the fragments were obviously forced by violent explosion.\r\nThe pit is in ordinary sedimentary strata, and the material of the rim\r\nis composed of the disrupted fragments of the sedimentary rock ejected\r\nfrom the pit. There are no signs of igneous material, but there was\r\nigneous action in the vicinity. Fragments of a meteorite were found\r\non the rim and in the vicinity, but this association appears to be\r\naccidental. Computation shows that the volume of the material of the\r\nrim closely matches the size of the pit. The source of the explosion\r\nis not demonstrable, and it may be an error to connect it with an\r\nintrusion of lava below; but since intrusions rise to various degrees\r\nof nearness to the surface, and in innumerable cases reach the surface,\r\nthere is every reason to entertain the conception of a class of\r\nintrusions which develop explosive phenomena by close approach to the\r\nsurface, without actually reaching it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 459.—Photograph of a portion of the moon taken at\r\n  Lick Observatory.]\r\n\r\n=Lunar craters.=—There are grounds for thinking that the remarkable\r\ncraters of the moon, assuming that they are truly volcanic,[277] may\r\nbelong to this class, for they are very similar to the Coon Butte\r\npit. The capacities of the lunar craters, so far as they can be\r\nestimated, seem to equal, if they do not in many cases exceed, the\r\nvolume of matter in their rims. They do not appear usually to be\r\ngreat cones of accumulated material with relatively small craters,\r\nlike the typical products of terrestrial volcanoes. Besides, there\r\nare no clear evidences of lava-streams. The radiating tracts once\r\ninterpreted as such have been shown by increased telescopic power\r\nand the resources of photography to be at least something other than\r\nlava-streams. They are vaguely defined tracts which run over heights\r\nand depths indifferently, and are plausibly interpreted as lines of\r\ndébris projected to extraordinary distances because of the absence of a\r\nlunar atmosphere, and because of the low force of the moon’s gravity.\r\nSince the moon now has no appreciable atmosphere or surface-waters, and\r\nsince it is doubtful whether it ever possessed either on account of its\r\nprobable inability to hold atmospheric gases or the vapor of water in\r\nthe form of an envelope about it, owing to its low gravity, there is\r\nreason to suppose that the external matter of the moon derived from the\r\nexplosions of the multitude of lunar volcanoes would remain in a loose,\r\nincoherent condition, from the absence of dissolving and cementing\r\nagencies. It is reasonable to suppose that lava-tongues arising from\r\nthe deeper interior would have a higher specific gravity, even in their\r\nheated condition, than this porous covering of the moon, and that\r\ntherefore they would almost universally become intrusions rather than\r\nextrusions, or at most they would not rise beyond the bottom of the\r\ncraters they had produced by explosion. This seems to furnish at least\r\na plausible explanation of the prevailing differences between the large\r\nlunar craters encircled by mere rims and the much smaller terrestrial\r\ncraters seated in relatively large cones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n=Number of volcanoes.=—It is impracticable to state exactly the\r\nnumber of volcanoes that are active at the present time, because most\r\nvolcanoes are periodic, and become active at more or less distant\r\nperiods, and it is impossible to say whether a given volcano that may\r\nbe now quiescent has really become extinct or is only enjoying its\r\ncustomary period of rest. It is quite safe to include at least 300 in\r\nthe active list, and the number may reach 350 or more. The numbers that\r\nhave been active so recently that their cones have not been entirely\r\nworn away is several times as great.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Distribution of Volcanoes._\r\n\r\n1. =In time.=—In the earliest known ages igneous action appears to\r\nhave been very general, if not practically universal. No area of the\r\nearliest (Archean) rocks is now known which is not formed chiefly of\r\nrocks that appear to have been either intruded or extruded. Rocks which\r\ncan reasonably be assigned to the hypothetical molten globe, if there\r\nbe such, are not here included. It is probable that the surface of the\r\nearly earth was as thickly occupied with points of extrusion as the\r\nsurface of the moon appears to be. In the ages between the Archean and\r\nthe present, the distribution of volcanic action over the surface seems\r\nto have been in a general way much what it is to-day; that is, certain\r\nareas were volcanically active at times, while other and larger areas\r\nwere measurably free from any outward expressions of igneous action.\r\nThis is not equally true of all ages, as will be seen in the historical\r\nstudies that follow. There were periods when volcanic activity seems\r\nto have been widespread and energetic, and others when it was limited\r\nboth in amount and distribution. The known facts do not indicate a\r\nsteady decline in volcanic activity, but rather a periodicity; at\r\nleast this is so for the portion of the globe that is now well enough\r\nknown geologically to warrant conclusions. One of the greatest of the\r\nvolcanic periods falls within the Cenozoic era, just preceding the\r\npresent geological period, and the volcanic activity of the present is\r\nperhaps but a declining phase of that time.\r\n\r\n2. =Relative to land and sea.=—At present the active volcanoes are\r\nchiefly distributed about the borders of the continents, and, less\r\nnotably, within the great oceanic basins. On this account the sea has\r\noften been supposed to have some connection with volcanic action, and\r\nthe presence of chlorine in the volcanic emanations has been cited\r\nin support of this position. When critically examined, however, the\r\nargument from distribution is not very strong; for the volcanoes are\r\nnot distributed equally or proportionately about the several oceans,\r\nas if dependent on them. Volcanoes are especially numerous around and\r\nwithin the Pacific, the greatest of the oceans, and this might seem a\r\nfavorable instance, but they are also numerous around and within the\r\nMediterranean, a relatively small body of water. Volcanoes are not\r\nespecially abundant in or about the margins of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 460.—Volcanoes in the Pacific. Jones Relief\r\n  Globe. (Photo. by R. T. Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\nIf volcanoes were dependent upon proximity to the sea, the relation\r\nshould be close in the past as well as in the present, but this does\r\nnot seem to be true. There has recently been much volcanic activity\r\nin the plateau region of western America at long distances from the\r\nPacific basin. Even on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains notable\r\nvolcanic action took place. There were also volcanoes in the interior\r\nof Asia and of Africa.\r\n\r\n3. =Relative to crustal deformations.=—The distribution of present\r\nand recent volcanoes is much more suggestively associated with those\r\nportions of the crust _that have undergone notable changes_ in position\r\nin comparatively recent times. The great “world-ridge” stretching from\r\nCape Horn to Alaska and thence onwards along the east coast of Asia\r\nis a striking instance, for it is dotted throughout with active and\r\nrecently extinct volcanoes. The tortuous zone of mountainous wrinkles\r\nthat borders the Mediterranean and stretches thence eastward to the\r\nPolynesian Islands is another notable volcanic tract. These two belts\r\ninclude the greater number of existing and recent volcanoes on the\r\nland, while the great basins associated with them embrace the chief\r\noceanic volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 461.—Active volcanic area at the junction of the\r\n  continental segments of North and South America, and of the abysmal\r\n  segments of the Atlantic and Pacific. Jones Relief Globe. (Photo. by\r\n  R. T. Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps some significance in the fact that the most active\r\nregions of vulcanism to-day lie _at the angular junctions of the great\r\nearth-segments_. The Antillean and Central American volcanic region,\r\nthat has recently been so demonstrative, lies where the southern angle\r\nof the North American continental block joins the northern angle of\r\nthe South American continental block, and where the western angle\r\nof the North Atlantic abysmal segment closely approaches one of the\r\neastern angles of the great Pacific abysmal segment. The complex and\r\nvery active Java-Philippine volcanic region lies where the southeastern\r\nangle of the great Asian segment projects toward the Australian block,\r\nand where the western angle of the Pacific block approaches the\r\nnortheastern angle of the Indian oceanic segment. The active Alaskan\r\nvolcanic area lies at the angles of the North American, Asian, Pacific,\r\nand Arctic segments. The Mediterranean volcanic area falls less notably\r\nunder this generalization, but it lies where the continental blocks of\r\nEurope and Africa come into peculiar relations to each other on either\r\nside of the remarkable Mediterranean trough. The eastern angle of the\r\nNorth Atlantic segment is near by, but not in very close relations.\r\nThe Icelandic region, small but vigorous, lies near the junction of\r\nthe North American, European, North Atlantic, and Arctic segments,\r\nand the New Zealand volcanic region is somewhat less closely related\r\nto the approach of the Australian, Antarctic, Pacific, and Southern\r\noceanic segments. Nearly all of these angular conjunctions involve\r\ntwo depressed segments joining two relatively elevated segments. This\r\nrelationship suggests a causal connection between the intensified\r\nmovements at these angular conjunctions and the intensified volcanic\r\naction of these regions. There are enough volcanoes, however, that do\r\nnot fall into these groups, or apparently into any other grouping, to\r\nsuggest that the development of volcanoes is not wholly dependent on\r\nany surface relationship, but that it is connected with deep-seated\r\ncauses that are indeed modified, but not wholly controlled, by surface\r\nconditions, or even by the movements of the master segments of the\r\nearth’s crust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 462.—Active volcanic area at the junction of the\r\n  continental segments of Asia and Australia, and the abysmal segments\r\n  of the Pacific and Indian oceans. Jones Relief Globe. (Photo. by R.\r\n  T. Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\n4. =In latitude.=—The distribution of volcanoes appears to have no\r\nspecific relation to latitude. Mounts Erebus and Terror, amid the\r\nice-mantle of Antarctica, and Mount Hecla in Iceland, as well as\r\nthe numerous volcanoes of the Aleutian chain, give no ground for\r\nsupposing that volcanoes shun the frigid zones. On the other hand,\r\nthe numerous volcanoes of the equatorial zone do not imply that they\r\navoid the torrid belt. Their distribution appears to be independent of\r\nlatitude. This is not cited because of any supposed effects of external\r\ntemperature, for that must be trivial, but because it bears on the\r\nquestion whether strains are now arising from the supposed _slackening\r\nof the earth’s rotation_, which have any connection with volcanic\r\naction. If the oblateness of the earth is decreasing, the equatorial\r\nbelt must be sinking and growing shorter, and hence must be under\r\nlateral pressure, while the polar caps must be rising, and increasing\r\ntheir curvatures, and should be under tension. These conditions, if\r\nreal, might be supposed to have something to do with the extrusion of\r\nlava. Nothing in the present or the past distribution of igneous action\r\nseems to afford much support to this hypothetical inference.\r\n\r\n5. =In curved lines.=—In the Antilles, the Aleutian Islands, the\r\nKurile Islands, and in other instances, there is a notable linear\r\narrangement of volcanoes with appreciable curvature. It has been noted\r\nthat the convexity of the curves is turned toward the adjacent ocean.\r\nIn some cases, however, there is a notable linear arrangement without\r\nappreciable curvature, as in the Hawaiian range, in the recently\r\nextinct line of cones of the Cascade Range, and in others. Less often,\r\nvolcanoes are bunched irregularly, as in some of the groups of volcanic\r\nislands of the Pacific (Fig. 460).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Relations of Volcanoes._\r\n\r\n1. =Relations to rising and sinking surfaces.=—So far as observations\r\ncover this point, the area immediately adjacent to active volcanoes\r\nis rising (Dutton). This is shown by raised beaches, terraces, coral\r\ndeposits, etc. Whether this is wholly due to the expansional effect\r\nof the heating of the subterrane by the rising lava, or whether it\r\nhas a wider significance, is not known. If a broader view is taken,\r\nit does not appear that there are sufficient data to connect volcanic\r\naction exclusively with either the rising or the sinking of the general\r\nsurface. It is certain that the great mountain ranges and plateaus in\r\nwhich so much of the more recent volcanic action has taken place have\r\nbeen recently elevated relatively, but they have also undergone more or\r\nless of oscillation, involving some relative depression. The question\r\nwhether the Pacific basin as a whole has been relatively elevated or\r\ndepressed in modern times is a mooted one. Darwin[278] and Dana,[279]\r\nas the result of their early studies on its coral deposits and on other\r\nphenomena, concluded that the Pacific was a sinking area, but this view\r\nhas been recently challenged by Murray[280] and Agassiz[281] with at\r\nleast some measure of success. From the fiords on the borders of the\r\nPacific and other physical phenomena, the inference has been drawn that\r\nrelative sinking of the land has recently taken place. Raised beaches\r\non the coasts are interpreted as indicating a relative rise of the land\r\nor a sinking of some ocean basin, for the withdrawal of the waters can\r\nonly be the result of increasing the capacity of the oceanic basin as\r\na whole. The most probable view is that the general areas of present\r\nand recent volcanic action are partly rising areas and partly sinking\r\nareas, and that movement of either kind may be connected with the\r\nextrusion of the lavas. The rising and sinking are but complementary\r\nphases of a deformation of the earth’s body, and involve a readjustment\r\nof stresses within the body of the earth. These stresses are possibly\r\nan essential factor in eruptions.\r\n\r\n2. =Relations to one another.=—A most significant feature of volcanic\r\naction is the degree of concurrence or of independence of action in\r\nadjacent volcanoes. In some instances they act as though in sympathy,\r\nas in the recent outburst in Martinique and Saint Vincent, and the\r\nconcurrent symptoms of activity in other places. On the other hand,\r\nthe independence of neighboring vents is sometimes extraordinary. The\r\ngroup of volcanoes near the center of the Mediterranean, of which\r\nVesuvius and Etna are the most conspicuous examples, usually act with\r\nmeasurable independence of one another, an eruption in the one not\r\nbeing habitually coincident with an eruption in the others. But the\r\nmost conspicuous instance of independence is found in the great craters\r\nof Mauna Loa and Kilauea in Hawaii. They are only about twenty miles\r\napart, the one on the top and the other on the side of the same great\r\nmountain mass. The crater of Mauna Loa is about 10,000 feet higher\r\nthan the crater of Kilauea, and yet, while the latter has been in\r\nconstant activity as far back as its history is known, the former is\r\nperiodic. The case is the more remarkable because of the greatness of\r\nthe ejections. The outflow of Mauna Loa in 1885 formed a stream from\r\nthree to ten miles in width, and forty-five miles in length, with a\r\nprobable average thickness of 100 feet, and some of its other outflows\r\nwere of nearly equal greatness; indeed its outflows are among the\r\nmost massive that have issued from volcanoes in recent times. Besides\r\nthis massiveness there have been extraordinary movements of the lava\r\nwithin the crater, if the testimony of witnesses may be trusted. But\r\nthroughout these great movements in the higher crater, the lava-column\r\nof Kilauea, 10,000 feet lower, continued its quiet action without\r\nsensible effects from its boisterous neighbor. The bearing of such\r\nextraordinary independence upon the sources of volcanic action is very\r\ncogent, for the lavas are of the same type, both being basalts, that of\r\nMauna Loa being notably basic and probably as high in specific gravity\r\nas that in Kilauea. No difference in specific gravity that could at\r\nall account for a difference in height of 10,000 feet can be presumed,\r\nunless their ducts remain separate to extraordinary depths. Nor does\r\nit appear possible that a superior amount of gas within the column of\r\nMauna Loa could account for such an extraordinary difference in height,\r\nfor the hydrostatic pressure of such a column is not far from 10,000\r\npounds to the square inch. Even if the difference in the heights of\r\nthe columns could be explained by differences in specific gravity,\r\nthe agitation of the one should be communicated to the other, and an\r\noutflow of the one, particularly an outflow by a breakage through\r\nits walls sufficient to lower its surface hundreds of feet, as has\r\nrepeatedly occurred in Kilauea, should change the surface of the other\r\nproportionately, if they were in hydrostatic equilibrium. It seems\r\na necessary inference, therefore, that the two lava-columns have no\r\nconnection with each other or with a common reservoir. The tops of some\r\nlava-columns stand about 20,000 feet above the sea, while others emerge\r\non the sea-bottom far below sea-level. The total vertical range is,\r\ntherefore, probably between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, a difference which\r\ntells its own story as to their relative independence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 463.—Surface of lava-flow of 1881, from Mauna\r\n  Loa, as seen back of Hilo, Hawaii. (Photo. by Calvin.)]\r\n\r\n3. =Unimportant coincidences.=—Eruptions seem to be somewhat more\r\nliable to occur at times of high atmospheric pressure than at low,\r\ndoubtless because the increased atmospheric weight on a large area of\r\nthe adjacent crust aids in forcing out the lava or the volcanic gases.\r\nThis can only be effective when other forces have almost accomplished\r\nthe result, and would doubtless have completed it a little later had\r\nnot the atmospheric wave supplied the little remaining pressure needed.\r\nEruption seems also to be more common when the tidal strains favor it,\r\nfor like reasons. In the same class are probably to be put the effects\r\nof heavy rains, whether they act by gravity or by giving rise to steam.\r\nSuch agencies are to be regarded as mere incidents of no moment in\r\nthe real causation of vulcanism, but of some value in determining the\r\nprecise moment of action. This is not to be understood as inconsistent\r\nwith the view that the periodic stresses of the body-tides of the\r\nearth are important factors in vulcanism, as elsewhere explained, but\r\nmerely that the special time of surface-eruption is only incidentally\r\nconnected with the water-tides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 464.—Crater of Kilauea.]\r\n\r\n=Periodicity.=—Most volcanoes are periodic in their stages of action.\r\nLong dormant periods intervene between eruptive periods. Volcanoes\r\nsupposed to be extinct occasionally awaken with terrific violence.\r\nSometimes also they awaken quietly. This larger periodicity yet awaits\r\nan explanation, but it very likely means a temporary exhaustion of the\r\nsupply of gas or of lava, or of both, to which the active stage is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Formation of Cones._\r\n\r\n=Lava-cones.=—The lava usually flows away from the vent in short\r\nstreams which solidify before running far. As the lava-streams flow in\r\ndifferent directions at different times, the total effect is a low cone\r\nformed of radiating tongues surrounding the point of exit. Occasionally\r\nthe streams run a dozen or a score of miles, but such cases, except in\r\nthe gigantic volcanoes of Hawaii and a few others, are rare. Often the\r\nstreams congeal before they reach much beyond the base of the cone, and\r\nquite often while they are yet on its slope. So far, therefore, as the\r\nvolcanic cone is formed of lava, it has a radiate structure made up of\r\na succession of congealed lava-streams. In these cases the slopes are\r\nlow, because the fluidity of the lava prevents the development of high\r\ngradients. It is, however, rather the exception than the rule, that\r\nthe cone is made up mainly of lava-streams, though the great Hawaiian\r\nvolcanoes are of this class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 465.—Typical cinder-cone, Clayton valley, Cal.\r\n  (Turner, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Cinder-cones.=—The larger portion of the lava blown into the air by\r\nthe expanding gas-bubbles falls back in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nvent and builds up a cinder-cone. From the nature of the case, this\r\noften takes on a beautiful symmetry and assumes a steep slope (Fig.\r\n465). The ragged cinders lend themselves readily to the formation of\r\nan acute cone, quite different from the flatter cone formed by lavas.\r\nSometimes the cinders are still plastic when they fall, and weld\r\nthemselves together and hold their places even on very steep slopes,\r\nbut usually they have already hardened before they reach the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 466.—Spatter-cone and cavern. Kilauea, Hawaii.\r\n  (Photo. by Libbey.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 467.—Hollow spatter-cone. Oregon. (Russell, U. S.\r\n  Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n=Subordinate cones.=—Small or temporary vents formed as offshoots from\r\nthe main vents often give rise to secondary or “parasitic” cones.\r\nThese are sometimes numerous, as in the case of Etna, and they may be\r\nso important that the mountain becomes a compound cone. A still more\r\nsubordinate variety consists of “spatter-cones” formed by small mildly\r\nexplosive vents that spatter forth little dabs of lava which form\r\nchimneys, or cones, and sometimes completely curved domes over vents\r\n(Figs. 466 and 467). Spatter-cones often arise from the lava-flows\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n=Composite cones.=—From most existing volcanoes there issue both\r\nlava-flows and fragmental ejecta, and the resulting cones are composite\r\nin material. The lava more frequently breaks through the side of the\r\ncone than overflows its summit, and this gives rise to irregularities\r\nof form and structure. The cones are also subject to partial\r\ndestruction both by the outbursts of lava and by the explosions, and\r\nperhaps also by migration of the vents. As a result, many volcanic\r\nregions show old, partially destroyed craters, together with new and\r\nmore perfect ones, and the history of volcanic action in a region may\r\noften be read in the succession of cone formations.\r\n\r\nThe form of the cone, when composed chiefly of lava, is also affected\r\nby the mass of the outflow and by its fluidity. The larger the outflow\r\nat a given time, other things being equal, the wider it distributes\r\nitself and the flatter is the cone. As a rule, the basic lavas are more\r\nfluid than the acidic, and the cones of basic lavas are flatter than\r\nthe cones of acidic lavas.\r\n\r\n=Extra-cone distribution.=—In violent eruptions, the steam, accompanied\r\nwith much ash, is shot up to great heights, often rolling outwards\r\nin cumulus or cauliflower-like forms (Fig. 458). In the more violent\r\nexplosions these columns are projected several miles. In the phenomenal\r\ncase of Krakatoa the projection was estimated at seventeen miles. The\r\nsteam, by reason of its great expansion and its contact with the colder\r\nregions of the upper air, is quickly condensed, and prodigious floods\r\nof rain frequently accompany the eruption. This rain, carrying down a\r\nportion of the ash and gathering up much that had previously fallen,\r\ngives rise to _mud-flows_, which in some cases constitute a large\r\npart of the final deposit. These mud-flows chiefly lodge on the lower\r\nslopes of the volcano or adjacent to its base, and give rise to rather\r\nflat cones, sometimes designated as _tufa-cones_ to distinguish them\r\nfrom cinder-cones formed by the direct fall of fragmental material.\r\nMud-flows appear also to be formed by the ejection of mud and water\r\nthat had gathered in quiescent craters during intervals between stages\r\nof eruption.\r\n\r\nA portion of the finer exploded material floats away in the air to\r\ngreater or less distances, and forms widespread _tufa-deposits_. In.\r\nsome cases beds of volcanic ash of appreciable thickness (as those\r\nof Nebraska)[282] are found far from any known volcanic center. The\r\nextremely fine ash from the great explosion of Krakatoa floated several\r\ntimes around the earth in the equatorial belt and spread northward into\r\nthe temperate zones.\r\n\r\nIllustration: +Fig.+ 468.—Mt.

In view of prevalent misconceptions, it may be repeated,\r\nfor the sake of emphasis, that lavas are mutual _solutions_ of mineral\r\nmatter in mineral matter, rather than simply melted rock. Into this\r\nmutual solution there enter not only rock materials, but gases. The\r\ndistinction between mutual solutions and simple molten rock cannot be\r\nrigorously made, but it is at least essential to know that the minerals\r\ndo not necessarily crystallize from lavas in the order of their melting\r\ntemperatures, or in any uniform order, but rather in the order in\r\nwhich saturation of the several mineral constituents happens to be\r\nreached in the given mutual solution. Thus quartz, which has a very\r\nhigh melting-point, is often one of the last minerals to crystallize.\r\nThe mutual solutions are exceedingly complex, embracing a wide range\r\nof chemical substances, but the chief of them, as already stated, are\r\nsilicates of aluminum, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and iron,\r\nwith minor ingredients of nearly all known substances, in greater or\r\nless proportion. The old idea of lavas as simply melted rock is not,\r\nhowever, wholly to be abandoned. The mode of solidifying is often\r\nsimply that of molten matter freezing. If lava be suddenly cooled, the\r\ncongelation is essentially the solidification of a melted substance.\r\nThe result is a glassy body, every part of which has essentially the\r\nsame composition that the liquid had. Usually, however, even in this\r\ncase, the gases escape in part. If the cooling is slower, the various\r\nsubstances in the mixture crystallize out into minerals in the order in\r\nwhich they severally reach saturation. This involves the principle that\r\nsolubility is dependent on temperature, and that as the temperature\r\nsinks the degree of solubility declines, and the saturation-point for\r\nsome constituents of the solution is reached earlier than for others.\r\nWith sufficiently slow cooling, all the material will pass into the\r\nsolid state by the crystallizing of the several minerals in succession.\r\nThis does not mean that two or more minerals may not be forming at the\r\nsame time, for crystals often interfere with each other’s growth. It\r\ndoes, however, involve the doctrine that some substances may complete\r\ntheir crystallization while the surrounding material is yet in the\r\nfluid condition. In most igneous rocks nearly perfect crystals of\r\ncertain minerals are common, while other minerals, crystallizing later,\r\nare compelled to adapt themselves to the space left. This conception is\r\nsupported by the fact that lavas, while still in the fluid condition,\r\noften contain well-formed crystals, and these crystals sometimes make\r\nup a considerable percent. of the flowing mass, just as water in\r\ncertain conditions may be filled with crystals of ice. So also crystals\r\nafter having been formed may be redissolved in part, doubtless because\r\nof changes in the nature of the magma due to undetermined conditions\r\nwhich may arise in the process of crystallization, or from the\r\naccession of gas, or from new material dissolved from the walls of the\r\npassageway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 469.—Lobular form of lava-flow, “Pahoehoe.”\r\n  (Dutton, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 470.—Terminal portion of a rough lava-flow,\r\n  “_aa_.” Cinder Buttes, Idaho. (Russell, U. S. Geol. Surv.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: +Fig.+ 471.—Lava flowing over a precipice near Hilo,\r\n  Hawaiian Islands.]\r\n\r\n=Consanguinity and succession of lavas.=—The lavas that are poured\r\nforth at different stages in the succession of eruptions of a given\r\nregion are usually not the same, as might naturally be expected, but\r\nform a curious series the members of which are related to one another.\r\nIddings has called this relation _consanguinity_.[283] No universal\r\nlaw of succession has yet been established, and perhaps none exists;\r\nbut Richthofen[284] many years ago announced a definite order for the\r\nTertiary flows of western America which seems to hold fairly well\r\nin its general aspects, though not everywhere completely realized,\r\nso far as surface observation goes. Richthofen’s order is: (1) lavas\r\nof neutral types, (2) lavas of acid types, (3) lavas of basic types,\r\n(4) lavas of more acid types, and (5) lavas of more basic types. The\r\nspecial varieties of rock vary, and even the general order is often\r\napparently defective. The defects are sometimes assigned to the\r\nconcealment of some of the outflows. While this may be true in some\r\ncases, it is not unlikely that in others there is a real failure of the\r\nsequence. At any rate, the sequence can only be regarded as a rough\r\ngeneralization. It is supposed to be due to magmatic differentiation\r\ncaused by the differences of temperature to which the different parts\r\nare subjected underground, by differences of specific gravity and\r\nfluidity which result from changes of temperature, and probably by\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\n=Temperatures of lavas.=—Accurate determinations of the temperatures\r\nin the center of the lava-columns, where they have been least reduced\r\nby contact with the rock-walls, have not yet been made, but it is\r\nclear from the whiteness of the lavas that their temperatures are\r\noften appreciably above the melting-point. This is also a necessary\r\ninference from the length of time they remain fluid, notwithstanding\r\nthe great surface contact of the column in its miles of ascent, the\r\nconversion of contact water into steam, and the expansion and escape\r\nof the gases. In cases where determination has been practicable (and\r\nthey certainly do not represent the maximum temperatures) it has been\r\nfound that the melting-points of silver, about 960° C., and of copper,\r\nabout 1060° C., are reached. In connection with overflows, it has\r\nbeen found that brass is decomposed into its component metals, the\r\ncopper actually crystallizing. Silver has been sublimed, and made to\r\nredeposit itself in crystalline form. This implies much more than the\r\nbare melting temperatures. Even the fine edges of flints have been\r\nfused. It is, therefore, probably safe to assume that the original\r\ntemperatures of the lavas as they rise to the surface sometimes reach\r\nconsiderably beyond 2000° Fahr. (1093° C.), and may perhaps even attain\r\n3000° Fahr. or more. Even these temperatures must be somewhat below\r\nthe original subterranean temperatures of the lavas, because some heat\r\nmust necessarily be lost in rising, partly by contact with the walls\r\nof the colder rocks through which they pass, probably for as much as a\r\nscore of miles at least, and partly from the expansion of the gases\r\nwithin them. If any considerable part of these gases is derived from\r\nwaters which joined the lava in its upward course in the fracture zone,\r\nthe energy consumed in raising the water to the high temperatures\r\nof the lavas must be subtracted from the original heat, and must be\r\na further source of reduction of temperature. It is important to\r\nemphasize this point in view of its bearing upon the origin of the\r\nlavas. It has been suggested that lavas may be due to an aqueo-igneous\r\nfusion, a kind of fusion which may take place at comparatively moderate\r\ntemperatures. It seems obvious, however, from the phenomena themselves,\r\nthat temperatures as high as ordinary dry fusion, and perhaps even\r\nhigher, are attained. It is clear also that the maintenance of the\r\nliquid condition in a constant state of ebullition for a long period\r\nof time implies a large surplus of heat above that necessary for\r\nliquefaction simply. This is especially true if the ebullition comes\r\nfrom surface-waters penetrating to and becoming absorbed in the\r\nlava-column below. This process must tend rapidly to exhaust the heat\r\nin the column of lava. If, on the other hand, the gases are derived\r\nfrom the deep interior, and the ebullition at the surface is due to\r\ntheir escape, they may bring up new supplies of heat to counteract the\r\ncooling effects of their expansion.\r\n\r\n=Depth of source.=—Attempts have been made to ascertain the depth from\r\nwhich lavas rise, by means of the earthquake tremors that accompany\r\neruptions. The estimates have ranged from seven or eight to thirty\r\nmiles. The mode of estimate is that discussed under earthquakes, and is\r\nsubject to the corrections there indicated. If these could be perfectly\r\napplied, the estimates might probably all fall within ten miles, and\r\nnot improbably all within six miles of the surface. But in any case the\r\nmethod really tells very little as to the true point of origin of the\r\nlava. At most it probably only tells where the ascending lava begins\r\nto _rupture_ the rock through which it passes, and rupture may not be\r\npossible below the zone of fracture, which is probably not more than\r\nsix miles deep. In the zone of flowage below, where the pressure is too\r\ngreat to permit fracture, the lava not improbably makes its way by some\r\nboring or fluxing process, which might not, because of its nature, be\r\ncapable of giving rise to seismic tremors. The behavior of the tremors\r\nperhaps forces us to locate the origin of lava movement _at least as\r\nlow as the bottom of the fracture zone_, but it probably offers no\r\nsufficient ground for limiting the lava’s origin to this or any other\r\nspecific depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VOLCANIC GASES.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive feature of volcanoes is the explosive action\r\narising from the gases and vapors pent up in the lava. There is not a\r\nlittle explosive action of a secondary character arising from the mere\r\nouter contact of surface-waters with lavas or with the hot rocks of the\r\ncrater walls, or with the hot ashes and rocks thrown out; but these are\r\nincidental, not essential, features.\r\n\r\nThe precise nature of the occlusion or absorption of gases and vapors\r\nhas not yet been determined. It is thought that lava spontaneously\r\nabsorbs such gases when at high temperatures, and especially when the\r\ngases are under great pressure, and that as the pressure is relieved\r\nand the lava is cooled and solidified, the larger part of the gases\r\nescapes. In those cases in which the eruption is quiet, the escape\r\nof the gases is but partial while the lava is in the crater, and\r\nmuch gas remains to be given out from the molten material after it\r\nhas been extruded and is about to congeal. The gases are then given\r\noff with relative slowness and quietness. If, however, the lavas are\r\nsurcharged with gases, and if these are restrained from free escape\r\nby the viscosity of the lavas, the gases gather in large vesicles in\r\nthe lava in the throat of the volcano, and on coming to the surface\r\nexplode, hurling the enveloping lava upwards and outwards, often to\r\ngreat distances. The violence of projection reduces a portion of the\r\nlava to a finely divided state constituting the “ash” and “smoke” of\r\nthe volcano. Other portions less divided are inflated by the gases\r\ndisseminated through them, and form “pumice” and “scoria,” according\r\nto the degree of inflation, while masses of lava that have already\r\nsolidified into more or less rounded masses in the crater are hurled\r\nforth as “bombs”; not infrequently portions of the walls of the crater\r\nor of the duct below are also disrupted and shot forth.\r\n\r\n=Differences in gas action.=—The causes of the differences of gas\r\naction in different volcanoes are undetermined, but the following\r\nsuggestions may point to a part of the truth: (1) Doubtless some lavas\r\ncontain more gases than others, and hence are predisposed to be more\r\nexplosive; (2) some are more viscous than others and hence hold the\r\ngases more tenaciously until they accumulate and acquire explosive\r\nforce, while the more liquid lavas allow their gases to escape more\r\nfreely and easily; (3) some are hotter than others, and hence hold\r\ntheir gases until after they have escaped from the crater, when they\r\ngive them off from their expanded surfaces in the open air, where there\r\nis no restraint to develop explosiveness; (4) some flows are so massive\r\nthat they cool to the chief gas-discharging point only after they are\r\nspread out on the surface, when quiet escape is possible; (5) probably\r\na main occasion of the very violent explosions lies in the fact that\r\nthe lavas have begun to crystallize while yet in the duct of the\r\nvolcano. The crystals, in forming in the magma, exclude the gases from\r\nthemselves, and this excluded portion overcharges the remaining portion\r\nof the lava. This process continues as the lava rises and grows cooler\r\nuntil the gases acquire great volume and explosive force. This view is\r\nsustained by the fact that the pumice and ash of such extraordinarily\r\nexplosive eruptions as those of Krakatoa and Pelée contain many small\r\ncrystals which had certainly formed before the explosive inflation took\r\nplace. Incipient crystallization does not, however, appear to be a\r\nuniversal accompaniment of explosive action.\r\n\r\n=Spasmodic action.=—The discharge of the gases is spasmodic, and\r\nusually consists of a succession of distinct explosions. Sometimes\r\nthese succeed one another at rather constant and frequent intervals,\r\nas in Stromboli, where the explosions follow one another at intervals\r\nof three to ten or more minutes. In many others the outbursts are\r\nrhythmic, while in others the spasms are distant and irregular.\r\n\r\n=Kinds of gases.=—Steam is the chief volcanic gas. Its constituents,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen, are also present in the free state, and are\r\nperhaps the result of the dissociation of the steam at the very\r\nhigh temperatures of the lavas. Carbon dioxide is probably next in\r\nabundance. No positive statement as to the relative amounts of the\r\nsubordinate gases can be made because of the obvious difficulties\r\nof obtaining anything like a representative analysis of the gases\r\nconcerned in the great volcanic eruptions. The materials for the\r\nanalyses which have been made were derived chiefly from little\r\nsecondary or “parasitic” vents, or from side-wall crevices, through\r\nwhich the volcanic gases rise. Such vents probably derive their gases\r\nfrom the very border of the main mass, where it is most subject to\r\nthe influence of waters and gases from the adjacent walls, and it is\r\nuncertain how far they are truly representative of the gases in the\r\ninterior of the lava itself. The data now at command seem to indicate\r\nthat carbon dioxide increases greatly in relative abundance as volcanic\r\naction dies away. Great quantities of this gas are often given forth\r\nlong after all signs of active vulcanism have disappeared. Such gases\r\nhave been attributed to the action of the lavas on buried beds of\r\nlimestone or other carbonates, but in many cases the geology of the\r\nregion offers no special support to this hypothesis. It does not seem\r\ninherently probable that the heat of the lava would be sufficient to\r\ndecompose limestone at a period very long after the active eruption. An\r\nalternative suggestion is that the stronger volcanic acids mentioned\r\nbelow are gradually conveyed into the adjacent rocks and there act on\r\nlimestones or on partially carbonated crystalline rocks, setting free\r\ncarbon dioxide. Whatever may be true with regard to secondary gases of\r\nthis kind, it is quite certain that the lavas themselves contain large\r\nquantities of carbon dioxide, and also of carbon monoxide, doubtless\r\nreduced from the dioxide. Sulphur gases are very common accompaniments\r\nof volcanic eruptions. They take the forms of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nand sulphurous acid and perhaps of sublimated sulphur, all of which\r\nare liable to pass by oxidation and hydration into sulphuric acid.\r\nChlorine and hydrochloric gases are also common, particularly at high\r\ntemperatures. Fluorine and other gases are occasionally present.\r\nCertain gases, such as hydrogen and chlorine, are especially associated\r\nwith high temperatures and energetic action, and are probably dependent\r\non them. Hydrochloric acid and the sulphurous gases are also mainly\r\nassociated with high temperatures, while sulphuretted hydrogen is\r\ncommoner at lower temperatures. Oxygen, nitrogen, and probably\r\ncarbon dioxide or carbon monoxide are present throughout all ranges\r\nof temperature. Nitrogen is a rather frequent but not very abundant\r\nconstituent of the volcanic gases. How far it results from admixture\r\nof the atmosphere and how far it is original, is not determined. It\r\nis, however, one of the gases found in volcanic rocks after they have\r\ncooled, and is presumably original in part. A large series of secondary\r\nvapors naturally arise from the volatilization of substances contained\r\nin the lavas, such as the oxides, chlorides, and sulphides of the\r\nmetals, etc.\r\n\r\n=Residual gases in volcanic rocks.=—Some light upon the vital question\r\nof the original, as distinguished from the secondary gases of lavas may\r\nbe found in the analyses of the gases that remain in the lavas after\r\nthey are solidified. When the lavas lodged underground without free\r\ncommunication with the surface, there is reason to think that they\r\nretained a larger percentage of their original gases in solidification\r\nthan in cases of free exposure at the surface; at any rate, such\r\nrocks contain notable quantities of gases occluded in some way within\r\nthemselves. Recent surface-lavas also contain gases of similar kinds,\r\nbut not in equal degree, so far as available analyses show. The gases\r\nare in part held in numerous small cavities within the constituent\r\nminerals, especially in the quartz. This is perhaps due to the fact\r\nthat quartz usually crystallizes late in the process of solidification,\r\nand its mother-material becomes crowded with gases excluded by the\r\nprevious crystallization of other minerals. Analyses of twenty-five\r\ncrystalline rocks of various kinds from many typical localities by\r\nTilden,[285] gave an average volume of gas, under ordinary atmospheric\r\npressure, four and a half times that of the containing rock. This shows\r\nthe condensed condition in which the gases are held. Of these gases,\r\nthe chief is hydrogen, which much exceeds all the rest. Next in order\r\nof abundance is carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, marsh\r\ngas (CH₄), and nitrogen. Water is frequently present and free oxygen\r\nalmost universally absent. The average ratio of hydrogen to carbon\r\ndioxide by volume in these analyses is about 70 : 30. Five complete\r\nanalyses gave the following averages: H₂, 52.134; CO₂, 34.104; CO,\r\n8.422; CH₄, 3.224; N₂, 2.072. It will be seen that the gases contained\r\nin these rocks are in proportions radically different from those of\r\nthe atmosphere, and it is doubtful whether they can be reasonably\r\nassigned to any other source than the lavas from which the rocks\r\nwere formed. It is to be noted, however, that some sedimentary and\r\nmeta-sedimentary rocks, such as quartzite and quartz-schist, contain\r\nsimilar gases, but this may be because the granules of the original\r\nrock retain them, notwithstanding the secondary processes through\r\nwhich they have passed. Analyses of meteorites show essentially the\r\nsame gases in much the same proportions. If evidence of this kind can\r\nbe trusted, the standard original gases of lavas are the elements or\r\ncompounds of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, in the order named, while\r\nthe chlorine and sulphur gases are to be regarded as accessory. Because\r\nof their intensely energetic and noxious character, these latter\r\ngases make themselves disproportionately manifest in the vicinity\r\nof active volcanoes. That they are really not preponderant seems to\r\nbe implied by the fact that the volcanic rains, which are extremely\r\ncopious, are usually fresh, and only in rare cases is the presence of\r\nthe hydrochloric or sulphurous elements sufficient to produce noxious\r\neffects. Volcanic and meteoric data seem to indicate that steam is held\r\nless tenaciously than the other gases in the magmas as they solidify\r\ninto rocks.\r\n\r\n=The source of the gases.=—As already noted, it is one of the\r\noutstanding problems of geology to determine (_a_) how far the gases of\r\nlavas were possessed by them from their origin, whatever that may be,\r\nand (_b_) how far they have been acquired in the lava’s ascent to the\r\nsurface. It is recognized that lavas have the power of absorbing gases,\r\nand one of the views entertained is that surface-waters, percolating\r\nthrough the rocks and coming in contact with the ascending column of\r\nlava, are converted into steam, which is absorbed into the lava and\r\nrises with it to the surface. There are two phases of this view. (1)\r\nThe more conservative one supposes that the water merely penetrates\r\nthe fracture zone of the surface of the earth through the ordinary\r\nmeans of passage of underground-waters, and so makes a comparatively\r\nshort circuit. Under this view, the steam and other gases given forth\r\nare not a contribution to the atmosphere and hydrosphere, but merely\r\na restoration to them of water and dissolved gases previously carried\r\ndown from the surface. An even narrower view is sometimes entertained\r\nwhich supposes that the larger part of the water descends through the\r\nvolcanic cone itself, or immediately about its base. The presence of\r\nchlorine gases in the volcanic emanations and the nearness of most\r\nexisting volcanoes to the sea have been the basis for the idea that\r\nsea-water, penetrating to the lava, is a chief source of the volcanic\r\ngases. (2) The broader phase of the view assumes that the waters\r\npenetrate not only the outer fracture zone of the earth, which is\r\nprobably limited to five or six miles in depth, but that they diffuse\r\nthemselves through the continuous unfractured zone down to depths\r\nwhere temperatures of fusion prevail, and that they there enter into\r\ncombination with the lavas or with hot rock to form lavas. It is well\r\nknown that aqueous vapor facilitates the fusion, or more accurately,\r\nthe mutual solution of the minerals. This view is a part of one of the\r\nhypotheses concerning the origin of the lavas themselves.\r\n\r\nThe opposing view supposes that the gases were in the main original.\r\nOf this view there are two phases: (1) One supposes that the lavas\r\nare remnants of an original molten globe which absorbed gases from\r\nthe primitive atmosphere and retained them till the time of their\r\neruption. The possible absorption of steam and air into the supposed\r\nmolten globe has been much neglected in current conceptions of\r\nearly conditions. If the lavas of the supposed molten globe absorbed\r\nproportionately as much water-vapor as the volcanic lavas often\r\ncontain, it would probably take forty or fifty times the present ocean\r\nand atmosphere to supply them. Any remnants of these original lavas\r\nmight well be supposed to hold gases. Even rocks derived from them by\r\ndeep-seated solidification might retain much gas. (2) The other phase\r\nof the view assumes that the gases were entrapped when the globe was\r\nbuilt up of meteoroidal or planetesimal matter, as assumed in the\r\naccretion hypothesis.\r\n\r\nUnder either of the last two views the gases may be said to be primary,\r\nand genetically connected with the origin of the lavas themselves. Such\r\ngases would be a contribution to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.\r\nThis view does not exclude the idea that as the lava rises through the\r\nsurface-rocks, other gases are formed by contact, and that they may be\r\nabsorbed into the rising column. On the contrary, the view recognizes\r\nthe possibility that a tongue of lava rising into the upper formations\r\nmay encounter bodies of water, or masses of thoroughly water-soaked\r\nrock, from which great quantities of steam may be generated, and that\r\nthis accessory steam may be a large factor in the initial explosion\r\nwhich often accompanies the development of a new volcano, or the new\r\neruption of an old one after a long period of quiescence.\r\n\r\nA decision on the vital question whether the volcanic gases are largely\r\nprimary, or are essentially secondary, has not yet been reached;\r\nbut it will doubtless be reached when a sufficient number of really\r\nrepresentative analyses of volcanic gases have been made, and when the\r\nphenomena of the gases occluded in igneous rocks have been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar proportions of the rock-gases, in which hydrogen and\r\ncarbon dioxide so greatly preponderate, seem to imply that they are\r\nnot derived from the atmosphere; at least if they were so derived,\r\nthere must have been a selective absorption of a most remarkable kind,\r\nbecause hydrogen is present in the atmosphere in exceedingly small\r\nquantities, while carbon dioxide is a very minor constituent. At the\r\nsame time, as already remarked, no free oxygen is usually found in\r\nthese absorbed gases.\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether the larger part of the volcanic gases is\r\noriginal or is merely a special form of convective circulation, has an\r\nimportant bearing on the supply of the atmosphere, which is constantly\r\nbeing depleted by the oxidation of the rocks and by the formation of\r\ncarbonates and carbonaceous deposits. This vital phase of the subject\r\nwill receive further consideration. While recognizing the lack of\r\ndecisive proof, it would seem that the preponderance of evidence lies\r\nin favor of the view that a notable portion, at least, of gaseous\r\nvolcanic emanations is derived from the interior of the earth, and\r\nis really a contribution to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. The\r\nhydrogen, on coming in contact with the atmosphere, ignites and adds\r\nitself to the hydrosphere. The carbon dioxide is in part decomposed by\r\nplants, and adds to the supply of atmospheric oxygen. The nitrogen,\r\nbeing comparatively inert, doubtless gradually accumulates in the air\r\nand has thus come to be its preponderant constituent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CAUSE OF VULCANISM.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary facts involved in volcanic phenomena cannot well be\r\ndiscussed fully until the origin of the earth is considered, and the\r\ngreat agencies, as well as the peculiar conditions, which the earth\r\ninherited from its birth, are duly weighed, for these were, with little\r\ndoubt, the true causal antecedents of vulcanism. We shall return to\r\nthe subject after a sketch of the early conditions of the earth, but\r\nthe views that have been entertained may be reviewed here while the\r\nphenomena are fresh in mind.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of vulcanism involves two essential elements. These\r\nare (1) the origin of the lavas, which involves a consideration of the\r\nnecessary temperatures, pressures, and other conditions, and (2) the\r\nforces by which the lavas are expelled.\r\n\r\nNearly all current explanations of vulcanism are founded upon\r\nconditions supposed to be derived from a molten globe, and fall under\r\ntwo general classes: (I) those which assume that the lavas are residual\r\nportions of the original molten mass, and (II) those which assign the\r\nlavas to the local melting of rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n          I. _On the Assumption that the Lavas are Original._\r\n\r\nIn this case it is not necessary to assume any special accession of\r\nheat, but merely to account for extrusion. There are two phases of\r\nthis view, (1) the one postulating a general molten interior, (2) the\r\nother limiting the molten matter to local reservoirs.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis I. Lava outflows from a molten interior.=—In the early\r\ndays of geology, when the earth was supposed to have a thin crust and\r\na molten interior, it was very naturally assumed that volcanoes were\r\nbut pipes leading down to the molten mass within. This view has been\r\nessentially abandoned. The independence of adjacent vents is in itself\r\nalmost a fatal objection, when it is recalled that the height of recent\r\nvolcanic craters ranges from nearly 20,000 feet above the sea, to\r\n10,000 to 20,000 feet below. The view would involve the conception of\r\nlava-columns connected with a common reservoir varying possibly 30,000\r\nto 40,000 feet in altitude, and certainly more than half that much,\r\nsimultaneously. The lower outlets should as certainly be selected for\r\nthe outflow of the great interior sea of fluid rock, as the lowest\r\nsag in the rim of a lake for its outflow, for no great differences in\r\nspecific gravity are presumable under this hypothesis. An equally grave\r\nobjection arises from tidal strain. If the earth were liquid within and\r\nmerely crusted over by a shell of rock of moderate thickness, it would\r\nyield appreciably to tidal stresses, and this yielding would change the\r\ncapacity of the interior so that with every distortion of the spheroid\r\na portion of its fluid interior would be forced to the outside, and\r\nwith every return to the more spheroidal form there would either be\r\na re-flow to the interior or a shrinking of the crust. In any case a\r\nvery demonstrative response to tidal influence would tell the story of\r\ninterior fluidity. No such effects are observed. The tidal strains may\r\nperhaps have a slight effect in hastening a given eruption when the\r\nforces are approaching a delicate balance and an eruption is imminent,\r\nbut the very triviality of this influence implies not only the absence\r\nof a general liquid interior, but also of extensive reservoirs.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 2. Lavas assigned to molten reservoirs.=—A modification of\r\nthe preceding view has been made to escape the difficulties involved\r\nin the hypothesis as stated above. It is supposed that while nearly\r\nall the subcrust solidified, numerous liquid spots were left scattered\r\nthrough it. This honeycombed substratum is supposed to connect the\r\ncontinuous outer crust with a central solid body, solidified because\r\nof pressure in spite of its high temperature. This hypothesis escapes\r\nonly a portion of the objections. For instance, the lavas in Mauna Loa\r\nand Kilauea in Hawaii differ nearly 10,000 feet in height, and hence\r\ncannot well be supposed to connect with the same reservoir, but they\r\nare both on the same vast cone, which implies at least an equally large\r\nmolten reservoir as its source. If there were two distinct reservoirs\r\nof the required magnitude, they must be singularly placed to supply\r\nvents so near and yet so independent. The difficulty grows greater when\r\nthe whole Hawaiian chain is considered, for the points of eruption seem\r\nto have migrated from the northwesterly islands, where the volcanoes\r\nare old, to the southeastern end, where volcanic activity is now in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural under this view to suppose that these residuary\r\nlakelets of liquid rock should be gradually exhausted as time goes\r\non, and that vulcanism should be a declining phenomenon. It is not\r\nclear that this is the case. The great number of existing volcanoes in\r\nregions where great extrusions took place in earlier ages does not seem\r\nto be in harmony with the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n         II. _On the Assumption that the Lavas are Secondary._\r\n\r\nThe serious difficulties that arise in interpreting volcanic lavas\r\nas remnants of an original molten mass, and the strong arguments of\r\nrecent years for a very solid earth, have turned inquiry chiefly\r\ntoward the second class of hypotheses, which refer the origin of\r\nlavas to the local melting of deep-seated rock. These differ widely\r\namong themselves. One group seeks for a cause of the melting in\r\nthe penetration of surface air and water; another, in the relief\r\nof pressure; a third, in crushing and shearing; a fourth, in the\r\ndepression of sediments into the heated interior zone; and a fifth, in\r\nthe outward flow of deep-seated heat.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 3. Lavas assigned to the reaction of water and air\r\npenetrating to hot rocks.=—As steam is one of the great factors in the\r\nexplosions of volcanoes, and as water reduces the melting-point of\r\nrocks, it is a natural and simple view that water penetrating through\r\nthe fissures and pores of the outer crust and coming into contact with\r\nthe heated rocks below, is absorbed into them and renders them liquid,\r\nand that then, being rendered swollen and lighter by the process, they\r\nascend and discharge quietly or explosively according to the special\r\nconditions of the case. Naturally the suggestion arises that the waters\r\nwould be converted into steam long before they could reach rock hot\r\nenough to be melted, and that this steam would be forced back along\r\nits own track, as the line of least resistance, rather than force\r\nitself into the rock material and rise in the lava-column; but to\r\nthis it is answered that an experiment of Daubree’s has shown that\r\nwater will penetrate the capillaries of sandstone against high steam\r\npressure and add itself to the steam within. The fact is also cited\r\nthat certain substances, when highly heated, absorb gases which they\r\ngive out when they cool. The absorption of hydrogen by platinum, and\r\nof oxygen by molten silver, are illustrations. It is certain that the\r\nlavas do contain large quantities of absorbed gases, and that these\r\nare partly, and in most cases largely, given out in cooling, when the\r\ncooling takes place at the surface. The presumption is that the lavas\r\nwould take the gases up again on remelting under similar conditions.\r\nIf the lavas of actual volcanoes had the temperatures of aqueo-igneous\r\nfusion (700°-1000° Fahr.) only, it would strengthen this view; but as\r\ntemperatures of lavas often exceed 2000° Fahr., and probably sometimes\r\nreach 2500° Fahr., and perhaps 3000° Fahr., it is not easy to account\r\nfor such temperatures under this hypothesis, because they would only\r\nbe reached at levels far below those at which aqueo-igneous fusion\r\nmight be presumed to take place. Perhaps this could be met by invoking\r\npressure which might prevent even aqueo-igneous fusion from taking\r\nplace until these temperatures were reached, but pressure brings in a\r\ngrave difficulty in another line, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nThere is a phase of the water-penetration hypothesis which seeks to\r\naccount for an accession of heat. It is affirmed that the outer rocks\r\nare oxidized, while the inner ones were not originally, or at least\r\nnot completely oxidized, and that air and water from the surface,\r\nreaching the unoxidized zone, enter into combination and generate the\r\nnecessary heat. This view was pardonable before the development of\r\nmodern thermo-chemistry, but is now quite untenable, as may be shown by\r\nworking out the reactions thermally.\r\n\r\nAll views which assign the penetration of surface air or water as\r\na cause meet with a grave, if not insuperable, difficulty in the\r\ncondition of the lower part of the earth’s crust (see p. 218). The\r\nfractured condition of the crust, which permits a ready penetration of\r\nwater, is a very superficial phenomenon. Below the first few thousand\r\nfeet the crevices and porosities of the rock are rapidly closed by the\r\npressure of overlying rock, and all appreciable crevices and pores\r\nprobably disappear at a depth of five or six miles. The effective\r\nfunction of fissures is, therefore, limited to the upper few miles of\r\nthe crust, and even here to certain portions only. The great pressures\r\nin gas- and oil-wells show that in many quite superficial beds, even\r\nwhen arched, there are no fissures or pores capable of letting even\r\ngas escape effectively. The depths at which the temperatures of lavas\r\nare reached are usually estimated, from the downward increase of\r\ntemperature, at 20 to 30 miles. This leaves from 14 to 24 miles of the\r\ncompressed zone between the lowest assignable limit of the fissured\r\nzone, and the highest assignable zone for the origin of lavas. This\r\nthick zone of dense rock must be reckoned with in all hypotheses that\r\ninvolve the penetration of air and water from without, and, as well,\r\nthe extrusion of lavas from within. In addition to the difficulties\r\nof the penetration of ground-water, the limitations of its heat, at\r\npenetrable depths, also bear adversely (see p. 219), on the descent of\r\nair and water.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 4. Lavas assigned to relief of pressure.=—It seems to\r\nbe demonstrated that pressure raises the melting-point of average\r\nrock, and hence at twenty or thirty miles’ depth there may be rocks\r\nhot enough to melt at the surface, but still solid because of high\r\npressure. If this pressure were in some way relieved they would become\r\nliquid. Pressure may be locally relieved somewhat (1) by denudation,\r\n(2) by certain phases of faulting, (3) by anticlinal arches, and (4) by\r\ncontinental deformation.\r\n\r\n(1) In most cases of denudation, cooling below probably keeps pace\r\nwith loss above. At any rate, many volcanoes rise from the bottoms\r\nof the oceans where no denudation takes place, and this phase of the\r\nhypothesis is not workable there.\r\n\r\n(2) The theory of relief by faulting finds encouragement in the fact\r\nthat many volcanoes occur on fault-lines. There is no evidence,\r\nhowever, that this is a universal or necessary relation. Computation as\r\nto the amount of lowering of the melting-point that might arise from\r\nthe faulting associated with volcanoes indicates that it is necessary\r\nto suppose that the rocks were already very close to the melting-point\r\nwhen the faulting took place, to make the doctrine applicable. It is\r\nto be observed that in faulting the relief of pressure on one side\r\nof the fault-line is likely to be balanced by increased pressure on\r\nthe other side, and that this difference in pressure may be lost by\r\ndistribution at a depth of 20 or 30 miles, where, at the nearest, this\r\ndelicate relation between solidity and liquidity, on which the theory\r\nis dependent, may perhaps be reached.\r\n\r\n(3) Immediately under an anticlinal arch there may doubtless be some\r\nrelief of pressure within the limits of strength of the arch, which is\r\nnot great (p. 582). The pressure under the arch _as a whole_ is greater\r\nthan before it was bowed up by lateral thrust, and in depth this excess\r\nbecomes distributed so as to obliterate the local relief under the\r\ncenter of the arch, and so _adds_ the effects of folding to the average\r\npressure of the crust. Besides, as a matter of fact, volcanoes do not\r\nappear to be especially associated with mountain folds where arching\r\nreaches its best expression.\r\n\r\n(4) The same general considerations bear on the assignment of\r\nliquefaction to relief of pressure in connection with the more general\r\ndeformation of the earth’s body. Besides, while relief of pressure\r\nmight account for liquefaction, it leaves the extrusion without an\r\nobvious cause; indeed, it would seem to furnish a condition opposed to\r\nextrusion, and if pressure were subsequently added to force the liquid\r\nout, it would tend to restore the solid condition.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 5. Lavas assigned to melting by crushing.=—Mallet[286]\r\nand others have attributed melting to the crushing of rock. Crushing,\r\nin the ordinary sense of the term, can only take place in the zone of\r\nfracture, and that is apparently too shallow to meet the requirements\r\nof the case. Below this zone, the pressure on all sides is too great to\r\npermit any separation of fragments, and a solid mass can only change\r\nits form by what is called “solid flowage.” The rock under these\r\nconditions may be compressed, and this compression must give rise to\r\nheat, but at the same time the melting-point is raised, according to\r\nall experiments. It seems improbable that melting can be produced in\r\nthis way. If great pressure could be brought to bear upon a tract of\r\nrock so as to heat it by compression, and if then the pressure were\r\nrelaxed before the heat generated could be distributed by conduction,\r\nand if re-expansion did not follow, possibly melting could be effected,\r\nbut this makes the process complicated and apparently inapplicable. It\r\nis scarcely possible that such a sequence of events can have affected\r\nall the tracts that are now volcanic, much less all those that have\r\nbeen such throughout geologic history. As noted in the preceding\r\ncase, relaxation would seem to be unfavorable to expulsion. Besides,\r\nvolcanoes do not seem to be confined to tracts that show signs of great\r\ncrumpling and crushing, as the Alps, the Appalachians, and the closely\r\nfolded ranges generally. Extrusions seem rather more common with\r\nfaulted ranges where crushing is less notable and where surface tension\r\nreplaces compression.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 6. Lavas assigned to melting by depression.=—It is observed\r\nthat in certain regions great thicknesses of sediments have accumulated\r\nby the slow settling of the crust below, and as these sediments\r\nobstruct the outward flow of heat while the lower beds settle nearer\r\nto the interior source of heat, it is conceived that they become\r\nheated below and, being saturated with water, take on aqueo-igneous\r\nfusion and rise as lavas, well supplied with internal gas and steam\r\nfrom the water and volatile constituents that were entrapped and\r\ncarried down with them. The question obviously arises whether such\r\ndepression is sufficient to give the temperatures the lavas show,\r\nand whether volcanic action is confined to such areas of depression\r\nand deep sedimentation. At the highest credible estimates—which are\r\nnone the less to be taken with reserve—the post-Archean sediments\r\nrarely reach five or six miles in thickness at any given point, and\r\nprobably never exceed ten or twelve, while twenty or thirty miles is\r\nthe computed depth required for the acquisition of the temperatures\r\nthe lavas actually possess. If the Archean terranes be included among\r\nthe sedimentaries, the thickness may be adequate, but what then of the\r\nArchean vulcanism, which much surpasses that of later times, and the\r\nother early extrusions before the sediments were thick; and what of the\r\nmoon, where there are probably no sediments at all?\r\n\r\nBesides, it is not at all clear that the distribution of vulcanism is\r\nspecially related to that of thick sediments, as it should be if this\r\nhypothesis were the true one. There are many volcanoes in the heart of\r\nthe great oceans where sedimentation is now inappreciable, and probably\r\nhas been in all past periods.\r\n\r\n=Hypothesis 7. Vulcanism assigned to the outflow of deep-seated\r\nheat.=—If the earth grew up by slow accessions of meteoroidal or\r\nplanetesimal matter, in a manner to be more fully set forth in the\r\ndiscussion of the origin of the earth, and if its interior heat be due\r\nchiefly to compression by its own gravity, the internal temperature\r\nwould be originally distributed according to the degree of compression,\r\nand this would depend on the intensity of the internal pressure. This\r\ncan be approximately computed, and is shown in the diagram on page 563,\r\nwhere this subject has been treated. On not improbable assumptions\r\nregarding the thermometric conductivity, the flow of heat from the\r\ndeep interior to the middle zone would be greater than the loss of\r\nthis zone to the superficial zone. This middle zone should, under\r\nthis view, experience a rising temperature. By hypothesis, this zone\r\nis composed of various kinds of matter mixed as they happened to fall\r\nin. Hence as the temperature rises, the fusion-points of some of these\r\nconstituents will be reached before those of others. More strictly,\r\nthe temperatures at which some of these constituents will mutually\r\ndissolve one another will be reached, while other constituents remain\r\nundissolved, and thus a partial and distributed liquefaction will\r\narise. The gases and volatile constituents in the mixed material would\r\nnaturally enter largely into the liquefied portion. It is assumed\r\nthat with a continued rise of temperature, the partial liquefactions\r\nwould increase until the liquefied parts found means of uniting, and\r\nthe lighter portions, embracing the gaseous contingent, were able to\r\nwork their way toward the surface. As they rose by fusing or fluxing\r\ntheir way, the pressure upon them became less and less, and hence the\r\ntemperature necessary for liquefaction gradually fell, leaving them a\r\nconstantly renewed margin of temperature available for melting their\r\nway through the upper horizons. Thus it is conceived that these fusible\r\nand fluxing selections from the middle zone might thread their ways up\r\nto the zone of fracture and thence, taking advantage of fissures and\r\nfractures, reach the surface. It is conceived that such liquefaction\r\nand extrusion would carry out from the middle zone the excess of\r\ntemperature received from the deeper interior, and thus regulate its\r\ntemperature and forestall general liquefaction, the zone as a whole\r\nremaining always solid. The independence of volcanoes is assigned\r\nto the independence of the liquid threads that worked their way to\r\nthe surface. Nothing like a reservoir or molten lake enters into the\r\nconception. The prolonged action of volcanoes is attributed to the\r\nslow feeding of the liquid threads from the locally fused middle zone.\r\nThe frequent pauses in action are assigned to temporary deficiencies\r\nof supply; the renewals to the gathering of new supplies after a\r\nsufficient period of accumulation. The distribution of volcanoes in\r\nessentially all latitudes and longitudes is assigned to the general\r\nnature of the cause. The special surface distributions are assumed to\r\nbe influenced, though not altogether controlled, by the favorable or\r\nunfavorable conditions for escape presented by the crustal segments of\r\nthe earth. The persistence of volcanic action in time is attributed\r\nto the magnitude of the interior source, to its deep-seated location,\r\nand to the slowness of conduction of heat in the earth’s interior. The\r\nforce of expulsion is found in the stress-differences in the interior,\r\nparticularly the periodic tidal and other astronomic stresses (see p.\r\n580), and in the slow pressure brought to bear on the slender threads\r\nof liquid by the creep of the adjacent rock. The violent expulsions are\r\ndue to the included gases, of which steam is chief. Little efficiency\r\nis assigned to surface-waters, and that little is regarded as wholly\r\nsecondary and incidental. The true volcanic gases are regarded as\r\ncoming from the deep interior and as being true accessions to the\r\natmosphere and hydrosphere. The standing of the lavas in volcanic ducts\r\nfor hundreds and even thousands of years with only small outflows,\r\nas in some of the best-known volcanoes, is regarded as an exhibition\r\nof an approximate equilibrium between the hydrostatic pressure of\r\nthe deep-penetrating column of lava, and the flowage-tendency of the\r\nrock-walls, the outflow being, of course, also conditioned on the\r\nslow rate of supply below, and the periodic stress-differences of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nFor the present these hypotheses must be left to work out their own\r\ndestiny, serving in the mean time as stimulants of research. All but\r\nthe last have been for some time under the consideration of geologists,\r\nand are set forth in the literature of the subject (p. 636).\r\n\r\nA few special phases of the problem need further discussion, though\r\nthey have been incidentally touched upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Modes of Reaching the Surface._\r\n\r\nAll of the views that locate the origin of the lavas deep in the earth\r\nmust face the difficulties of the passage through the dense portion of\r\nthe sphere below the fracture zone. Near the surface, the lavas usually\r\ntake advantage of fissures or bedding-planes already existing or made\r\nby themselves. There is little evidence that they bore their way by\r\nmelting, though they round out their ducts into pipes as they use them,\r\nmuch as streamlets on glaciers falling into crevices round out moulins.\r\nBut this use of fissures and bedding-planes for passage is probably\r\nmerely a matter of least resistance where the lavas are relatively\r\ncool, and their capacity for melting is low or perhaps even gone.\r\nDaly has recently urged that lavas work out reservoirs and enlarge\r\npassageways for themselves by detaching masses of rock from the roofs\r\nand sides of the spaces already occupied by them, these masses either\r\nmelting and mingling with the lava, or else sinking to lower positions\r\nin the column. This process he designates _stoping_.[287]\r\n\r\nIn the denser and warmer zone below, the alternatives seem to be (1)\r\nmelting or fluxing, or (2) mechanical penetration without fracture. As\r\nrocks “flow” in this zone by differential pressure without rupture,\r\nan included liquid mass may be forced to flow through the zone by\r\nsufficient differential pressure. If local differential pressures at\r\nthe surface be neglected as probably incompetent, there only remain the\r\nstress-differences of the interior and the differences of hydrostatic\r\npressure between the lava-column and the surrounding solid columns.\r\nThe latter would not be great until a column of liquid of much depth\r\nwas formed, and the former would probably not be concentrated on the\r\nliquid in such a way as to force it bodily through the solid rock.\r\nProbably fusing or fluxing its way with the aid of stress-differences\r\nis the chief resource of the lava in the initial stages. In this it\r\nmay be supposed to be assisted by its gases, by its selective fusible\r\nand fluxing nature, by its very high temperature if it comes from\r\nvery great depths, as held in the seventh hypothesis, and by the\r\nstress-differences which prevail in the deep interior, as shown in the\r\nlast chapter. In ascending from lower to higher horizons, the lava\r\nwould be constantly invading regions of lower melting-point because of\r\nless pressure. It would thus always have an excess of heat above the\r\nlocal melting temperature until it invaded the external, cool zone,\r\nwhere the regional temperature is below the melting-point of surface\r\npressure. From that point on it must constantly lose portions of its\r\nexcess of temperature by contact with cooler rocks, and probably in\r\nthe process of fluxing its way in the compact zone. If this excess is\r\ninsufficient to enable it to reach the zone of fracture, the ascending\r\ncolumn is arrested and becomes merely a plutonic pipe or mass. If\r\nit suffices to reach the zone of fracture, advantage may be taken\r\nthereafter of fissures and of rupturing, and the problem of further\r\nascent probably becomes chiefly one of hydrostatic pressure, in which\r\nthe ascent of the lava-column is favored by its high temperature\r\nand its included gases. The hydrostatic contest is here between\r\nthe lava-column, _measured to its extreme base_, and the adjacent\r\nrock-columns, _measured to the same extreme depth_. The result is,\r\ntherefore, not necessarily dependent on the flowage of the outer\r\nrocks, but may be essentially or wholly dependent on the deep-seated\r\nflowage of the rock of the lower horizons. The ascending column may\r\nreach hydrostatic equilibrium before it reaches the surface, and may\r\nthen form underground intrusions of various sorts without superficial\r\neruption, or it may only find equilibrium by coming to the surface and\r\npouring out a portion of its substance and discharging its gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Additional Considerations Relative to the Gases._\r\n\r\nThe question whether the volcanic gases are a contribution to the\r\natmosphere and hydrosphere is so important in its bearings on the whole\r\nhistory of the atmosphere as to merit additional consideration here. As\r\nalready noted, if the volcanic gases arise from water and absorbed air\r\nthat have previously passed down through the strata, there is no real\r\ncontribution to the hydrosphere and atmosphere, but merely circulation.\r\nIf the gases are chiefly derived from the deep interior, they are an\r\nimportant accession to the atmosphere and hydrosphere.\r\n\r\nMost views are more or less intermediate, assigning a part of the\r\ngases to the interior and a part to the exterior. No one will question\r\nthat some part at least of the steam is due to the contact between the\r\nground-waters and the hot lava, and probably no one will question that\r\nsome gas comes from the interior if the lavas originate there. The\r\nvital question is, whence comes the major portion? Are the constant\r\nebullitions of some volcanoes and the terrific explosions of others due\r\nmainly to surface-waters, or to interior gases?\r\n\r\nIt seems to be certain that in most cases the gases are diffused\r\nthrough the substance of the lava, and are not simply in contact with\r\nthe walls of the column or with its summit. Without doubt steam is\r\ngenerated around the lava-column by external contact, and perhaps some\r\nexplosions are due to the entrance of the rising lava upon a crevice\r\nor cavern filled with water, or to the invasion of a lake gathered in\r\nan old crater; but it still remains a question whether the importance\r\nof such explosions has not been exaggerated. Such action does not\r\nseem competent to produce _inflated_ lavas, but merely shattered\r\nones. Water thus “suddenly flashed into steam” could scarcely diffuse\r\nitself intimately through the lava, for the process of diffusion is\r\nexceedingly slow. But inflated lavas, pumice, scoriæ, and cinders are\r\nthe typical products of explosive vulcanism. Not only in the ordinary\r\nVesuvian type, but in the extraordinary Krakatoan type, inflated lavas\r\nare the dominant product. Prodigious quantities of this covered\r\nthe sea about Krakatoa after its tremendous explosion in 1883. Judd\r\nestimates that the volume of included steam involved in the inflation\r\nof the pumice examined by him, was from three to five times that of the\r\nrock, and that the amount involved in exploding the lava into the fine\r\ndust that floated in the upper atmosphere for months, was presumably\r\nmuch greater.\r\n\r\nIf the sudden flashing into steam of bodies of water in external\r\ncontact with hot lava be rejected as only an incidental source of\r\nexplosion, it remains to be considered whether waters permeating the\r\nrock and becoming converted into steam may not be absorbed into the\r\nrising lava, become diffused through it, and ascending with it, explode\r\nat the surface. So far as access through fissures and cavities large\r\nenough to be entered by lava are concerned, it may safely be concluded\r\nthat since the hydrostatic pressure of the lava must be greater than\r\nthat of the water in the fissures, or else it could not rise, the lava\r\nwill enter them, forcing back the water or the steam generated from\r\nit, and, having penetrated as far as accessible, will solidify as a\r\ndike, and plug up the avenue of contact between the ground-water and\r\nthe portion of the lava still remaining molten. The numerous dikes\r\nthat attend volcanic necks testify to the prevalence of this action.\r\nThe capillary pores of the wall-rock, which cannot be thus bodily\r\noccupied by the lava, must doubtless become filled with steam, and\r\nthis, following the principles of Daubree’s experiment, will force\r\nitself into contact with the lava and be absorbed by it, but whether\r\nthis will be in sufficient quantity, and will become sufficiently\r\ndiffused through the body of the lava-column to produce the observed\r\neffects, is an open question. The increasing testimony of deep mining\r\nis that relatively little water flows through the deeper horizons. It\r\nis urged that the water remaining in solidified lavas is very unequal\r\nin distribution, as though due to unequal access and partial diffusion.\r\nThe argument seems strong, but to make it thoroughly good, it must be\r\nshown that this inequality is not due to _irregularity of discharge_\r\nof the gases during and after eruption, rather than to irregularity of\r\noriginal _accession_. There is, perhaps, as much ground for assigning\r\ndifferences in the degree of parting with the included gases, as in\r\nacquiring them. Doubtless those lavas that boiled and seethed for a\r\nlong period in the caldron were more fully deprived of their gases than\r\nthose that were more promptly disgorged and cooled with less convection\r\nand surface exposure.\r\n\r\n=Thermal considerations.=—Probably the most important consideration\r\nrelates to the heat effects. If underground-waters enter the\r\nlava-column and come forth as steam, great quantities of heat are\r\nconsumed in the process. Has the lava a sufficient excess of heat to\r\nstand this? Can ebullition be maintained for the observed periods if\r\nthe steam comes from ground-waters?\r\n\r\nMany lavas probably do not carry a very large excess of heat above\r\nthat necessary for liquefaction, for not a few of them contain\r\ncrystals already forming, which shows that they are within the range\r\nof the temperatures of solidification of their constituents. The same\r\nconclusion is indicated by the limited fusing effects shown by the\r\nwalls of dikes and sills. On the other hand, as already remarked,\r\ndikes and sills often show the effects of a rather rapid cooling from\r\nthe walls. The method of flow often implies the same condition for\r\nthe acidic lavas, since they usually behave as stiff, pasty masses\r\nof limited liquidity. On the other hand, the basic lavas, whose\r\nfusion-point is much lower, often flow freely and reach great distances\r\nbefore solidifying. The facts taken altogether imply that the average\r\ntemperature of the lavas is not much above the fusing-point of the\r\nacidic lavas, while it may probably be very considerably above the\r\nfusing-point of basalt. For a rough estimate, with no pretensions to\r\naccuracy, it may be assumed that in an average case there are 500°\r\nFahr. excess, but probably not 1000° Fahr. A computation based on even\r\nso rough an estimate as this may, by showing the order of magnitude\r\nof the thermal considerations, indicate their radical bearing. The\r\naverage temperature of the ground-water of the upper two or three miles\r\nof the crust—the only portion through which water probably penetrates\r\nwith sufficient freedom to be effective in this case—is probably less\r\nthan 200° Fahr. The specific heat of rock appears to average somewhat\r\nless than 0.2. The temperature of the lava may be taken at 3000° Fahr.\r\nas a sufficiently high average. From these data it follows that if\r\nan amount of ground-water equal to five percent. of the volume of\r\nthe lava entered the lava and was brought up to its temperature and\r\nthen discharged, the temperature of the whole mass would be lowered\r\n550° Fahr. It is therefore evident that only a small percentage of\r\nsurface-water can pass through the lava consistently with its continued\r\nfluidity.\r\n\r\nM. Fouqué estimated that the discharge of steam from a merely\r\n_parasitic cone_ of Etna during 100 days was equal to 2,100,000 cubic\r\nmeters of water. If this were ground-water, and the lava from which\r\nit issued had an excess of 500° Fahr. above the fusion-point, the\r\nformation of this steam would congeal a column 400 feet in diameter\r\nand 3000 feet deep in the time given. If this case is typical, and\r\nif Fouqué’s estimate is not greatly exaggerated or very exceptional,\r\nthe view that any large portion of the steam from volcanoes comes\r\nfrom surface-waters seems to be incompatible with the persistence of\r\nebullition and explosion which many of them exhibit. Stromboli has been\r\nin constant eruption as far back as the history of the region runs. It\r\nis now exploding every three to ten minutes, and yet the mass of lava\r\nseems to be small and its outflow inconsiderable. Is it possible that\r\na current of steam, given out with this activity for so long a period,\r\nwas derived from adjacent ground-waters, and has not yet solidified the\r\nlava?\r\n\r\nThe problem takes on a very different aspect if the steam, or at least\r\nsome large part of it, rises from great depths and brings thence an\r\nexcess of heat. It then becomes an agency for the maintenance of\r\nthe liquidity of the lava, for giving it convective motion, and for\r\npromoting explosive action, so long as it continues to rise.\r\n\r\nFor these and other reasons the balance of present evidence seems to us\r\nto favor the view that most of the steam and other gases come with the\r\nlava from its original source deep in the earth.\r\n\r\n  _References on vulcanism._—G.

THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF ORGANIC PROCESSES.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that life processes, as we know them,\r\nwere in operation in the earliest stages of the earth’s history. They\r\nwere introduced and developed gradually during its progress. With\r\nlife there came into the processes of the earth’s development three\r\ndistinctive factors:\r\n\r\nA. Certain chemical actions giving rise to compounds that are not known\r\nto occur independently of life.\r\n\r\nB. Certain modes of aggregation of material, and certain kinds of\r\nbodily movements, not known except in association with life.\r\n\r\nC. The mental element, under the direction of which certain new\r\nprocesses were inaugurated, and certain previous processes were\r\nmodified and controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    +A. The Chemical Work of Life.+\r\n\r\nThe peculiar chemical phenomena connected with life chiefly concern\r\nthe carbon compounds. In the inorganic world the carbon compounds are\r\nfew and simple. In the organic world they become extremely numerous\r\nand complicated. These compounds are very unstable, for the greater\r\npart, and their partial decomposition gives rise to many additional\r\ncompounds. Some of the true organic compounds and some of their\r\ndecomposition products have the power of combining with inorganic\r\nsubstances, and so produce an additional series of semi-organic\r\ncombinations. The total number of the compounds thus directly and\r\nindirectly connected with life greatly exceeds that of all inorganic\r\ncompounds. Their mass, however, is very greatly inferior.\r\n\r\n=Life material chiefly atmospheric.=—In the building up of the organic\r\ncompounds, a necessary step is the decomposition of certain inorganic\r\ncompounds. The chief of these is the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere\r\nand hydrosphere, the decomposition of which furnishes the carbon\r\nneeded for the organic compounds. On this account carbon dioxide may\r\nbe regarded as in some sense the basal material or the fundamental\r\nfood of the organic kingdom, and hence it plays a radical rôle in the\r\nlife-history of the earth.\r\n\r\nWater, and the constituents of water, oxygen and hydrogen, play a\r\nlarger part quantitatively, but a less distinctive part.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is also an essential element, and usually stands next to\r\ncarbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in quantity.\r\n\r\nThese, it will be noted, are all atmospheric constituents, and the\r\nmaterial of life is, therefore, dominantly atmospheric. This is\r\neven true of aquatic life, for it lives largely on the atmospheric\r\nconstituents dissolved in the water. The function of life, considered\r\nfrom the material point of view, is not only fundamentally concerned\r\nwith the atmosphere, and intimately dependent on its conditions, but\r\nits most important material effects appear to lie in its modification\r\nof the constitution of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n=The non-atmospheric factors.=—The atmospheric constituents are not,\r\nhowever, the only elements intimately connected with the life function.\r\nCompounds of sulphur, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, chlorine, iron,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, silicon, and other elements are more or less\r\nessential to the life of many organisms, or are employed by them for\r\ntheir skeletons, coverings, etc. Incidentally, nearly all the common\r\nelements become intimately related to living organisms either in the\r\nrelations of active elements in their physiological functions, or of\r\npassive elements in their structure or in their auxiliary parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Three Classes of Effects._\r\n\r\nOut of life processes grow three rather distinct classes of results:\r\n(1) changes in the amounts and proportions of the constituents of\r\nthe atmosphere and, to some slight extent, of the hydrosphere and\r\nlithosphere; (2) aid or hindrance to inorganic processes, such as\r\ndisintegration, erosion, and deposition; and (3) distinctive products,\r\neither (_a_) of organic matter that would not have come into the\r\nexisting combination but for life, such as peat, lignite, amber, etc.,\r\nor (_b_) of special forms of inorganic matter that would not have\r\narisen but for life, such as coral deposits, shell-marl, diatom ooze,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n          (1) _Changes in the composition of the atmosphere._\r\n\r\nThe succession of modifications which the atmosphere has undergone\r\nfrom time to time through the action of life will be discussed as the\r\nearth’s history is followed in the second volume. It may suffice here\r\nto note briefly the chief ways in which the atmosphere has probably\r\nbeen modified by the agency of life, not only as regards its quantity\r\nbut also as regards the proportions of its constituents.\r\n\r\n=The consumption and restoration of carbon dioxide.=—As the fundamental\r\nfood of the organic world, carbon dioxide has suffered enormous\r\nconsumption in the course of the geological ages, and is now reduced\r\nto the very small proportion of .0004 or .0003 of the whole. At the\r\noutset it was probably one of the most abundant constituents; possibly\r\neven the chief one. It has been partially restored, concurrently with\r\nits consumption, by animal respiration, by certain classes of plant\r\naction, and by combustion and other forms of inorganic combination.\r\nThis restorative action has been incomplete at all known stages of\r\nthe earth’s history, and hence there has been constant loss of carbon\r\ndioxide. The inorganic processes which have also profoundly affected\r\nboth the consumption and restoration of carbon dioxide are here\r\nneglected and discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=The freeing and consumption of oxygen.=—The oxygen of the atmosphere\r\nis actively consumed by animals and by plants, but on the other hand,\r\nit is set free abundantly by green plants, and hence its amount has\r\nprobably fluctuated from time to time according to the state of\r\nbalance between the organic processes of its production, and those of\r\nits consumption. The consumption of oxygen by organic processes is,\r\nhowever, little more than a reversal of the previous process by which\r\nit was set free; for instance, green plants in forming their food set\r\nfree the oxygen of the carbon dioxide used for the purpose. When the\r\norganic substance so formed is ultimately consumed through plant or\r\nanimal action or by inorganic means, an equivalent amount of oxygen\r\nreunites with the carbon to again form carbon dioxide. And so if the\r\nwhole of the organic matter is returned to the inorganic state, no more\r\noxygen is consumed than had been before set free in the process of\r\nforming the organic matter. But, as a matter of fact, a large amount\r\nof organic matter has not gone back completely to the inorganic state,\r\nand this residue constitutes a factor of no small importance in the\r\ngeological record.\r\n\r\n=The organic residue.=—There is a certain portion of vegetation that\r\nis not consumed by animals or by other plants, and that escapes\r\ncombustion and all kinds of ordinary decay, and this constitutes a\r\npart of the organic residue. Animals never completely oxidize all\r\nthe organic matter they take into their systems; their bodies never\r\nentirely consume themselves. A like statement may be made respecting\r\nthose plants that feed on organic matter. That which animals and plants\r\nleave unoxidized is indeed more or less preyed upon by other animals\r\nand plants, and relatively little escapes final reoxidation, but there\r\nis a remnant, and this constitutes another part of the organic residue.\r\nThe more conspicuous forms of the organic residue are found in the\r\nmucks, peats, lignites, coals, organic oils, and gases, but in addition\r\nthere is not a little disseminated organic matter in nearly all the\r\nsedimentary rocks; in the aggregate, this probably amounts to more than\r\nthe distinct organic deposits.\r\n\r\n=The meaning of the organic residue.=—All the unoxidized, or\r\nincompletely oxidized, carbon in the organic residue implies that\r\noxygen has previously been separated from this residual carbon by\r\nplants and given to the atmosphere, and hence has been a source of\r\natmospheric enrichment in oxygen. The amount thus contributed is\r\nequal to that which is required to restore the residual carbon to its\r\noriginal state of oxidation. So, in a similar way, the unoxidized\r\nhydrogen in the organic hydrocarbons and like compounds implies that\r\noxygen has been separated from the hydrogen of water and given to the\r\natmosphere, and hence this also is a source of atmospheric enrichment\r\nin oxygen. It seems safe, therefore, to conclude that the action of\r\nlife, taken as a whole, has increased the free oxygen of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhile not here under consideration, it is not to be forgotten that\r\ninorganic processes involving the same atmospheric constituents have\r\nbeen in operation concurrently with the organic processes, and that\r\nthey have also affected the amounts and proportions of the atmospheric\r\nconstituents. Rocks have been oxidized in greater or less measure\r\nat the expense of the atmospheric oxygen, and hence when the total\r\natmospheric problem is considered, there arises the question whether\r\nthe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has been increased or diminished\r\nduring geological history, when the balance is struck between the\r\ninorganic and the organic actions. The probabilities seem to us to\r\nstrongly favor the view that organic action has preponderated, and that\r\nthe oxygen has been increased beyond its primitive amount, but that it\r\nhas fluctuated during known geological history. The reasons for this\r\nview will appear in the historical chapters.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of the crystalline rocks and the solution of\r\nlimestone have consumed much carbon dioxide, and this is to be added to\r\nthe loss through organic action. On the other hand, there are inorganic\r\nprocesses that supply carbon dioxide, and hence when the larger problem\r\nof the atmosphere is raised, the factors become so complicated that\r\ntheir consideration is best deferred to the historical chapters. This\r\npassing reference may stand us in good part lest we forget, for the\r\nmoment, the inorganic factors in the atmospheric problem.\r\n\r\n=The more inert factor.=—Nitrogen in the free state is relatively inert\r\nchemically, and it does not appear that it can be used directly by the\r\nhigher plants and animals in appreciable amounts. Certain bacteria,\r\nand perhaps certain algæ[288] and other low forms of plants, have the\r\npower of using free nitrogen, and this is a principal way in which it\r\nis put within the reach of higher plants. Nitrogen is also combined\r\nin small quantity in the atmosphere by electric action, and thus made\r\navailable for plants. On account of the inertness of nitrogen and\r\nof the relatively limited amount required for organic purposes, the\r\nnitrogen of the atmosphere has been less consumed than the carbon\r\ndioxide. Besides this, the nitrogen compounds are very decomposable,\r\nand are very generally and completely returned to their original state.\r\nDeposits of nitrates or other nitrogenous compounds are relatively rare.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if there is any considerable source of supply\r\nconcurrent with this slight loss, the amount of nitrogen in the\r\natmosphere must have been increasing. We have seen that volcanoes\r\ngive forth considerable quantities of nitrogen, and that this _may_\r\nbe a real addition to the atmosphere, and not merely a return of\r\nthe atmospheric nitrogen that had been carried down previously by\r\nunderground-water. It has also been noted that crystalline rocks\r\ncontain occluded nitrogen, which is doubtless freed by their\r\ndisintegration. It is, therefore, not improbable that the nitrogen of\r\nthe atmosphere has been increasing, both actually and relatively.\r\n\r\n=Probable fluctuations of atmospheric composition.=—With this general\r\nsketch of the interplay of the atmospheric elements under organic\r\ninfluence, we are prepared for the further conception that if one\r\nor another of these actions was relatively more vigorous than usual\r\nfor a period, it would bring about a variation in the proportions of\r\nthe atmospheric constituents. If, for example, vegetation flourished\r\nluxuriantly for a long period, but was measurably protected from the\r\norganisms that preyed upon it and from inorganic decomposition, as by\r\nfalling into water or by prompt burial under sediment, the atmosphere\r\nmight be growing richer in oxygen. If, on the other hand, vegetation\r\nwere being relatively reduced, as _perhaps_ it is being reduced now\r\nby man, and if previous organic products were being reoxidized at an\r\nunusual rate, as they are now in the burning of timber, coal, natural\r\noil and gas, the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere might be relatively\r\nincreasing, while the oxygen might be relatively diminishing. The\r\npossible fluctuations of the atmosphere as the result of organic action\r\nare, therefore, matters of vital importance, and invite attention in\r\nthe historical study of the earth and in the outlook into its future.\r\n\r\n=The climatic effects of organic action.=—Interest does not, however,\r\nrest at this point. The researches of physicists have made it probable,\r\nif they have not altogether demonstrated, that the composition of\r\nthe atmosphere has much to do with the climatic conditions at the\r\nsurface of the earth. The atmosphere blankets the earth and equalizes\r\nits temperature. Acting as a screen, it subdues in some measure the\r\nintensity of the sun’s rays by day, while it retards the radiation\r\nof the earth’s acquired heat at night. This is in some measure the\r\nfunction of all the constituents of the atmosphere, but by no means\r\nof all equally. The oxygen and nitrogen are relatively diathermous,\r\nletting the sun’s rays pass in freely, and the earth’s rays pass\r\nout freely; but carbon dioxide and the vapor of water are much less\r\ndiathermous, particularly to rays of low intensity, such as are thrown\r\nout by non-luminous bodies like the earth. It follows that while the\r\nsolar rays come in rather freely and heat the surface of the earth,\r\nthe dark rays which the earth radiates back are measurably arrested by\r\nthe carbon dioxide and vapor of water, and serve to keep the air warm.\r\nThe influence of the vapor of water is vividly shown in the different\r\ndegrees to which cooling takes place at night in a dry and in a moist\r\natmosphere, respectively, where other conditions are the same. Ice is\r\nsaid to form at night in desert regions where the air is extremely dry,\r\neven within the tropics, while in humid regions of the same latitude\r\nand altitude oppressively hot nights are common. The influence of the\r\ncarbon dioxide is not thus familiarly demonstrated, since its amount\r\nvaries but slightly in different localities, but physical experiment\r\nindicates that it has a similar function.\r\n\r\nIf the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere varies from age to\r\nage, the climate of the earth must apparently vary accordingly, and on\r\nthis is built one of the hypotheses of climatic variation subsequently\r\nto be considered. We shall find that there have been great changes in\r\nthe climate of the earth during its history. There is good evidence\r\nof former glaciation, not only in the northern United States and in\r\nEngland, Germany, and central Russia, but in India, Australia, and\r\nSouth Africa. At other times, figs and magnolias grew in Greenland\r\nand Spitzbergen, and corals flourished in the Arctic seas. There is\r\ngood evidence of arid periods where humidity now prevails, and of\r\nhumid periods where aridity now prevails. It is not assumed that the\r\ninfluence of organic action on the atmosphere has been the sole, or\r\nperhaps even the main, cause of these great climatic changes, but it is\r\nbelieved that it has been an important contributing factor. It is even\r\npossible that the climate of the future is much dependent on the agency\r\nof man, as implied above, however little ground there may be to suppose\r\nthat he will, with altruistic purpose, control his action with a view\r\nto its bearing on the generations that may live tens of thousands of\r\nyears hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (2) _Aid and hindrance to inorganic action._\r\n\r\n=The promotion of disintegration.=—While the influence of organic\r\naction on the lithosphere is quite superficial, and far less radical\r\nthan that on the atmosphere, it is still important. Plants promote\r\nboth disintegration and disaggregation under certain conditions,\r\nand hinder them under others, as already set forth. Chemical action\r\nof a decomposing and solvent nature takes place in connection with\r\nthe roots of plants, while their growth sometimes rends rocks into\r\nwhose crevices they have insinuated themselves. The acids and other\r\nproducts of organic growth and of organic decomposition attack some\r\nof the constituents of the rocks and contribute to their solution and\r\ndisintegration. On the other hand, organic matter entrapped in the\r\nsediments, and so introduced into the strata at various depths, often\r\nacts as a reducing agency, causing the deposit of substances carried in\r\nsolution in the underground-waters. Ores are sometimes thus formed, as\r\nexplained in the discussion of ore-deposits (p. 476). Organic action\r\non the whole promotes solution and disintegration at the surface, and\r\nprepares the way for deposition below.\r\n\r\n=Protection against erosion.=—Another important function of vegetation\r\nis the protection of the land surface against erosion, as already noted\r\nin the discussion of erosion. A mantle of grass, especially if it forms\r\na turf, or a carpet of leaves protected by bush and forest, greatly\r\nretards surface wash. It does this not only because it directly covers\r\nthe soil, but because it holds back the run-off and tends to prevent\r\nthose violent floods which give to erosion its greatest intensity.\r\nThere is a marked difference between the erosive work which a given\r\namount of water will do if, in the one case, it runs off gradually, and\r\nin the other, precipitately. By way of offset, it is to be noted that\r\nthe disintegrating action of vegetation prepares the rock material for\r\neasy erosion, and to this extent helps in its removal by the drainage;\r\nbut on the average this is greatly overbalanced by the protection\r\nafforded by the vegetal covering, though this is not true in every\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n=The influence of land vegetation on the character of the\r\nsediments.=—The presence or absence of a vegetal covering influences\r\nthe kind of deposit which is derived from the land, particularly\r\nif the surface be occupied by crystalline rocks. If the surface be\r\nwell clothed with vegetation, the crystals of the complex silicates,\r\nsuch as the feldspars, micas, and ferromagnesian minerals, are\r\nusually disintegrated into clayey products before they are removed,\r\nso that, when borne away and deposited, the result is common shale.\r\nConcurrently, the relatively undecomposable quartz-grains are rounded\r\ninto sand, and deposited as common quartzose sandstone, while the\r\ncalcareous material is borne away in solution and deposited as\r\nlimestone. But if the surface be bare of vegetation, the crystalline\r\nrocks are usually _disaggregated_ before they are decomposed, for\r\ndestructive action works best at the junctions of crystals, and along\r\ncleavage lines, and hence the crystals are usually separated from one\r\nanother before they are fully decomposed. In the absence of a covering\r\nto hold them in place until they are decomposed, they are apt to be\r\nwashed away, and the resulting deposit consists in considerable part\r\nof grains of feldspar, mica, hornblende, and other minerals, which\r\ndo not usually occur in well-decomposed sediments. The deposits are,\r\ntherefore, of the nature of arkose, if the original rocks are granitic,\r\nor of the nature of wacke, as the term is used in this book, if they\r\nare of the basic type. On this is based the inference that a vegetal\r\ncovering of the land extended as far back in the history of the\r\nearth as clay shales, quartzose sandstones, and limestones form the\r\nprevailing sediments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      (3) _Distinctive deposits._\r\n\r\n=Organic rocks.=—In the chapter on the origin and descent of rocks,\r\na group of rocks formed directly from organic matter is recognized\r\nand described. The chief of these are peat, lignite, bituminous\r\ncoal, anthracite, and graphite. It is the belief of many geologists\r\nthat natural gases, oils, and asphalts are also mainly derived\r\nfrom animal and vegetal remains. An alternative view, advocated by\r\nMendelejeff and Moissan, assigns the oils, gases, etc., in part at\r\nleast, to deep-seated carbides to which water has gained access and\r\ndeveloped hydrocarbons, after the analogy of acetylene.[289] Whatever\r\nmay be the truth relative to inorganic action, it is clear from\r\ngeological conditions that some of the natural gases and oils are\r\norganic products. Besides the more common organic deposits, there\r\nis a long list of minor products, among which are amber, copalite,\r\nparaffine, ozocerite, camphene, etc. Guano and coprolites represent the\r\nexcrementitious class.\r\n\r\n=Inorganic rocks due to life.=—Besides these deposits of organic\r\nmatter, or of its decomposition products, there is a large class formed\r\nfrom the inorganic matter that served auxiliary functions in the\r\neconomy of life, such as shells, skeletons, etc. For the greater part\r\nthese are composed of calcium carbonate, and give rise to limestones,\r\nmarls, chalk, etc. Not a few, however, are silicious, and give rise\r\nto flints, cherts, and silicious earths. Some are formed of calcium\r\nphosphate, and a few of other inorganic material. The deposits formed\r\nin these ways have been defined in the chapter on rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Fossils._\r\n\r\nThe term _fossil_ is used so comprehensively as to include not only\r\nthe remains of plants and animals themselves, but their tracks,\r\nimpressions, casts, replacements, and all other distinct traces.\r\nIt also embraces nests, borings, implements, and other distinctive\r\nproducts. These enter into the formation of the two classes of rocks\r\njust considered, but they have an independent function. They constitute\r\nthe specific record of life, and their study not only reveals much of\r\nthe past history of plants and animals, but furnishes one of the most\r\nimportant means by which the ages of formations are determined. In the\r\nearly development of the science it was found that the uppermost and\r\nhence the latest beds of rock contain fossil forms either identical\r\nwith those now living, or closely similar to them; that beds below\r\nthese bear life relics that depart somewhat more from the living forms,\r\nand are somewhat less highly developed; that beds still lower bear\r\nfossils that depart still more from the living types, and are more\r\nprimitive in general, and so on down as far as fossils are found.\r\n\r\n=The general order of life succession determined by stratigraphy.=—Thus\r\nit appeared from the evidence of the strata that there was a general\r\norder of life succession. It was also found that this was, _in its\r\nmain features_, the same for all the continents. By continued and\r\nclose studies, the particulars of the succession were worked out more\r\nand more fully, and the work is still being pushed forward to greater\r\nand greater degrees of refinement. At the same time, it was found\r\nthat there were different faunas and floras in different parts of the\r\nworld in past times, much as there are now; that there were shiftings\r\nand migrations as now; that given species were increasing in some\r\nregions and dying out in others, and that innumerable variations and\r\ncomplications entered into the evolution and distribution of the life\r\nforms. But under and through all these there run a sufficient number\r\nof common features to show beyond reasonable question the order of\r\nsuccession of life.\r\n\r\nThroughout all this study, _the chief guide was the actual order_ in\r\nwhich the fossils were found in the succession of strata, because\r\nthere is no evidence so conclusive of the order of events as the\r\nsuperposition of the sedimentary beds when they are normal and\r\nundisturbed. By the study of the fossils in the successive beds, it was\r\nfound that there was a more or less progressive evolution of plants and\r\nanimals brought about by modifications of their forms, and that these\r\nmodifications assisted in determining the order of succession when\r\nthe evidence of the strata was defective; and so the biological and\r\nstratigraphical factors reacted helpfully on each other.\r\n\r\n=Fossils as means of correlation.=—While stratigraphy was thus, in\r\nthe earliest stages, the main reliance in determining the order of\r\nevents, and biology was the chief gainer, in the end stratigraphy\r\nreceived ample compensation, if indeed it did not become the greater\r\nbeneficiary; for at no known and accessible place is there a complete\r\nsuccession of sedimentary beds. There are great series here and there,\r\nbut their connections with one another are more or less concealed\r\nby surface formations or water-bodies. So also at many places the\r\nstratified series has been broken up by deformation, or cut away by\r\nerosion. Hence there was need for some reliable means of matching the\r\nbeds of separated series, and of making up a complete ideal series.\r\nThis means is found in the fossils they contain. While the variations\r\nof the faunas and floras in different regions, and their migrations,\r\nintroduce some minor difficulties, the relations of the fossiliferous\r\nbeds of one region to those of another can be determined with great\r\nsatisfaction, and often with great precision. This is particularly so\r\nwhen abundant floating or free-swimming species lived in the seas and\r\nwere freely fossilized, for they were deposited on the coasts of all\r\nthe continents at practically the same time, and no uncertainties from\r\nmigration or local differences in rate of evolution intervened to throw\r\ndoubt upon the correlation. Without the aid of fossils, the correlation\r\nof the deposits on the separate continents would be attended with\r\ngrave obstacles and much uncertainty, if not with quite prohibitive\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n          +B. Special Modes of Aggregation and of Movement.+\r\n\r\nInorganic solid matter is chiefly crystalloidal; organic matter is\r\nchiefly colloidal; but there are colloidal states of inorganic matter\r\nand there are crystalloids among the organic products. In the inorganic\r\nworld, solids very generally tend to organize in the form of crystals;\r\nin the organic world, they as generally tend to organize in the form of\r\ncells. Neither tendency is complete or exclusive, but each is dominant\r\nin its own sphere.\r\n\r\nStill more distinctive than the formation of cells is the growth of\r\ncomplex organized bodies, the differentiated members of which perform\r\nspecial functions for one another, and are mutually dependent on one\r\nanother. This is a profound departure from the habitual modes of the\r\ninorganic world.\r\n\r\nStill more so is the power of voluntary motion in more or less\r\ndisregard of outside physical influences. Through this power,\r\ndistribution may take place contrary to current and wind, and\r\nto gravitation itself. From the view-point of past geologic\r\ntransportation, this is perhaps more singular than important, for no\r\ngreat mass of matter has been transported contrary to the influences\r\nof gravity, wind, and current, by the exercise of this peculiar\r\npower of animals, but it is not without geologic importance in the\r\nmigrations and in the redistributions of organic influences that arise\r\nfrom migrations. When the influence of man is included, the geologic\r\neffects require consideration, but here the third distinctive factor,\r\nthe mental element, comes into effective play, and we pass to its\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       +C. The Mental Element.+\r\n\r\nCurrent opinion does not recognize a mental element as residing in the\r\nplant world, and it is divided as to the degree of its development in\r\nthe lower animal kingdom, but its influential presence in the higher\r\nanimal orders and in man is beyond legitimate question. Two phases\r\nare to be recognized: (1) the material work done under the stimulus\r\nand direction of mental impulses, as, for example, excavations,\r\ntransportations, changes of drainage, removal of forests, cultivation\r\nof soil, etc., and (2) the intellectual work of the faculties\r\nthemselves irrespective of material changes. In one view, geology\r\nis a purely material science concerned solely with the formation of\r\nthe earth and with the physical development and relations of its\r\ninhabitants. In another, geology is a comprehensive historical science\r\nconcerned with every phase of the world’s history, and certainly\r\nnot least with the higher forms of life development, with their\r\npsychological, sociological, and other phases of mental attainments,\r\nsince these are the highest output of the earth’s evolution. The latter\r\nseems to us the more comprehensive view.\r\n\r\n(1) =The material effects of the mental element.=—Lyell long since\r\nurged that the direct work of man in changing the face of the earth was\r\nslight compared with that of the contemporaneous inorganic agencies.\r\nHe called attention to the relative insignificance of the quarries,\r\npits, cellars, and other excavations of man, compared with the work\r\nof streams, waves, and other inorganic agencies. There is justness in\r\nthis view, but it needs qualification. It is to be observed that the\r\nmental era has but just begun, and that its effects are increasing\r\nwith a rapidity quite phenomenal when measured by the slow pace of\r\nmost geologic events. The excavations and transportations of material\r\nto-day show an enormous advance on those of Lyell’s day, which was,\r\ngeologically speaking, but a moment ago. The mile-tons of industrial\r\nfreightage in the Mississippi basin are to-day not wholly incomparable\r\nwith the drainage transportation of the same area a century ago. A\r\ncentury ago is named, because the surface was then covered with natural\r\nvegetation, and the normal effect of surface erosion, independent of\r\nman, was then experienced. At present the indirect effects of man’s\r\naction are mingled with those of natural processes, and these indirect\r\neffects are probably much more important than the direct ones. The\r\nremoval of the native vegetation and the cultivation of the soil\r\nexpose the surface to wash to a degree far beyond that prevalent when\r\nthe surface was prairie sod, or leaf-carpeted forest, and denudation\r\nand transportation have been greatly multiplied in consequence. Not\r\nonly has this cultivation increased the exposure to erosion, but, by\r\nincreasing the rate of run-off, it has added to the erosive power\r\nof the streams. The ditching of swamps and other tracts of retarded\r\ndrainage has contributed to this acceleration. The naked, soil-less\r\nuplands of some of the once populous kingdoms of the Orient, notably\r\nportions of Syria and Greece, are sad witnesses of the accelerated\r\nerosion that attends cultivation. The erosion of certain southern\r\nfields of the United States in the last forty years is another striking\r\nillustration. It is doubtful whether some parts of this region suffered\r\nas much erosion in the preceding five centuries as they have during\r\nthe last one. On the other hand, some compensation is found in the\r\nreservoirs established for water-power, and in artificial devices for\r\nretarding and steadying stream flow.\r\n\r\nIn the light of considerations such as these, man may well be regarded\r\nnot only as a potent geological agent, but as dangerously so to\r\nhimself. The hope is that the intelligence that has wrought a change\r\nof surface conditions serviceable for the present, but dangerous to\r\nthe future, will be so enlarged as to inspire a still more intelligent\r\ncontrol of surface conditions which shall compass the future welfare as\r\nwell as transient benefit.\r\n\r\n=Human modification of the animal and vegetal kingdoms.=—Man’s agency\r\nis also coming to be felt powerfully in the modification of the plant\r\nand animal life of the land and even to some extent of the sea. The\r\nlarger animals that are not propagated by man are fast approaching\r\nextinction. At the present rate of extension of man’s dominion, a\r\ncentury or so will see the disappearance of nearly every large mammal\r\nand reptile that he does not choose to protect or propagate. By way\r\nof compensation, certain selected animals are increasing and will\r\ndoubtless continue to increase. The result is, therefore, likely to\r\nbe a peculiar assemblage of animal life dependent strictly on the\r\nchoice of a dominant type, a state of things that has apparently never\r\noccurred in an equal degree in the past history of the earth. How far\r\nthe minor forms of life, especially the insect life, and the denizens\r\nof the sea, may be brought under this monopolistic control may not be\r\npredicted so easily.\r\n\r\nA similar profound transition in vegetation is being forced by man. The\r\nnative vegetation is rapidly being replaced by selected varieties, and\r\nby varieties that take advantage of conditions furnished by man. As the\r\nagricultural control of the earth becomes more complete and effective,\r\na result toward which very rapid progress is being made, a new flora\r\nof man’s selection will very generally prevail over the whole land\r\nsurface of the globe. It is doubtful whether at any time in the history\r\nof the earth changes of flora and of fauna, and of surface, have been\r\nmore rapid than those that are now taking place under the accelerating\r\ninfluence of man’s action, and this accelerating influence springs\r\nnot mainly from automatic or instinctive reaction, but from conscious\r\nimpulse and intelligent direction.\r\n\r\n(2) =The psychological factors as such.=—Are the introduction and\r\nthe evolution of the psychological factors themselves to be regarded\r\nas subjects of geological study? We shall find that, at the outset,\r\nthe geologic record is a complete blank so far as clear evidence of\r\nterrestrial organisms actuated by their own intelligence is concerned;\r\nthat later, organisms with some apparent consciousness and intelligence\r\nappeared, and that the mental element increased apace unto its present\r\nattainment. We know that relationships of a sociological nature arose\r\nin apparent feebleness, and gradually evolved into more definite,\r\nhigher, and more complex forms. By sociological factors we mean merely\r\nthose conscious relations which one organism bears to another, of\r\nwhich the parental and the gregarious impulses are two fundamental\r\nexpressions. For manifest reasons, the introduction and evolution of\r\nthe psychological and sociological factors themselves have received\r\nlittle direct recognition as a portion of geological studies. The\r\nrecord of such factors in the fossils of past ages is necessarily\r\nobscure and imperfect, and the interpretation of what there is lacks\r\ncertainty and precision. None the less, this psychological record,\r\nwith all its imperfections, is beyond valuation, and must, we think,\r\ncome to be an indispensable factor in the study of psychological and\r\nsociological evolution, for it shows, what nothing else can show\r\nequally well, the extremely prolonged history of that evolution, and\r\nit gives hints of modes and means which no study of existing stages\r\ncan equally reveal. The organization of the Cambrian trilobites,\r\nfor example, implies no small development of the senses and of the\r\ncoordinating faculties even at that early stage, and a study of the\r\nrelations of these to their fellow creatures opens up the first\r\nknown chapter in the sociological record of the earth’s inhabitants.\r\nFrom this stage onward the progress in the development of the higher\r\nfaculties, and of the sociological relations of the leading forms, is\r\none of the most instructive phases of the great history. Such a study\r\nreveals the fact that many questions, narrowly supposed to be purely\r\nhuman, have had their prototypes in the earlier experiences of the\r\nanimal kingdom. Some of these questions have found solutions, temporary\r\nor permanent, which passed under the test of ages to whose length human\r\nexperience affords no parallel, and have received the sanction or\r\ndisapproval of such tests according as they were well or ill adapted to\r\nthe actual conditions involved. If one seeks the lessons of history in\r\nthe largest sense, he cannot wisely neglect the prolonged record of the\r\ngreat biological family.\r\n\r\n\r\n          II. SPECIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE ORGANIC KINGDOMS.\r\n\r\nAn essential part of the historical chapters of the second volume will\r\nconsist of the description and illustration of the life progress of the\r\nsuccessive periods. It will suffice here to give a preliminary synopsis\r\nof the kinds of record made by the several groups of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n             +A. Contributions of the Plant Kingdom.+[290]\r\n\r\nThe record of plants in the early geological ages is extremely\r\nimperfect. In the very earliest times the conditions seem to have been\r\nwholly unsuited to the preservation of any relics of life; but even\r\nafter animal remains were abundantly preserved in the sea sediments,\r\nthe plant record was still very meager for a long period. This was\r\nprobably due in the main to two chief causes: (1) the probable\r\nsoftness and perishability of the early types of vegetation, and (2)\r\nthe fact that vegetation is preponderantly terrestrial. At no time\r\nhas marine vegetation reached a high development. Land conditions\r\nfavor decomposition, transportation, and erosion, and through these,\r\ndestruction; and only under rather occasional and exceptional\r\nconditions did the old lands leave a good record of their life.\r\nNevertheless all the great groups of plants, viz. the Thallophytes\r\n(algæ, fungi), the Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts), the Pteridophytes\r\n(ferns, horsetails, lycopods), and the Spermatophytes (gymnosperms,\r\nangiosperms) have left some record.\r\n\r\n\r\n          REFERENCE TABLE OF THE PRINCIPAL GROUPS OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n                {                  { Cyanophyceæ, blue-green algæ.\r\n                {                  { Chlorophyceæ, green algæ.\r\n                {                  { Rhodophyceæ, red algæ.\r\n                { Algæ and         { Phæophyceæ, brown algæ.\r\n                {   algoid forms   { Diatomaceæ, diatoms.\r\n                {                  { Coccospheres  }\r\n                {                  { Rhabdospheres } Pelagic algæ(?).\r\n+Thallophytes+  {                  { Charophyta, stoneworts.\r\n  (Thallus      {\r\n  plants)       {                  { Phycomycetes, algæ-fungi, water-molds.\r\n                {                  { Ascomycetes, ascus-fungi, mildews.\r\n                { Fungi and        { Basidiomycetes, basidium-fungi, mushrooms.\r\n                {   fungoid        { Æcidiomycetes, æcidium-fungi, “rusts.”\r\n                {   forms          { Schizomycetes, “fission-fungi,” bacteria.\r\n                {                  { Myxomycetes, “animal fungi,” slime-molds.\r\n                {\r\n                { Lichens            Symbiont algæ and fungi.\r\n\r\n+Bryophytes+    { Hepaticæ, liverworts.\r\n  (Moss plants) { Musci, mosses.\r\n\r\n                {Filicales         { Filices, true ferns.\r\n                {                  { Cycadofilices, cycad-ferns.\r\n                {\r\n                {Equisetales       { Equisetæ, scouring-rushes, horsetails.\r\n+Pteridophytes+ {                  { Calamites.\r\n  (Fern plants) {Sphenophyllales.\r\n                {                  { Lycopodiaceæ, club-mosses.\r\n                {Lycopodiales      { Lepidodendra.\r\n                {                  { Sigillaria and stigmaria.\r\n\r\n                {                  { Cordaiteæ, cordaites.\r\n                {                  { Cycadales  { Bennettiteæ.\r\n                { Gymnospermæ      {   (cycads) { Cycadaceæ.\r\n                {   (Naked seed)   { Coniferæ, evergreens.\r\n+Spermatophytes+{                  { Ginkgoaceæ, ginkgo.\r\n  (Seed plants) {\r\n                { Angiospermæ      { Monocotyledoneæ, cereals, grasses, etc.\r\n                {   (Covered Seed) {   (one-leafed seed).\r\n                {   (Flowering     { Dicotyledoneæ, oaks, poplars, peas, etc.\r\n                {     plants)      {   (two-leafed seed).\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Thallophytes (algæ, fungi, bacteria).=—The\r\nThallophytes embrace the simplest types of plants, and are probably the\r\nnearest present representatives of the ancestral forms. Some of them\r\nare minute one-celled organisms, as simple as an organism can well be\r\nconceived to be. The simple blue-green algæ of our fresh waters well\r\nrepresent this class. The most are, however, multicellular, and some\r\n(as the great seaweeds) rise to a degree of complexity and of a bodily\r\nsegmentation resembling that of the higher plants. The various species\r\nare adapted to an extremely wide range of conditions; some live in hot\r\nsprings at 170° Fahr., and some in Arctic seas at the freezing-point;\r\nsome flourish in fresh water, some in brackish, some in salt water, and\r\nsome even out of the water. This wide adaptation implies an ancient\r\nand plastic type. The fact that they flourish in waters so hot and\r\nsometimes also so sulphurous as to be fatal to most plants, suggests\r\nthe possibility of their introduction during the very early volcanic\r\nstages of the earth, while conditions were yet uncongenial for other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe geologic work of the thermal algæ is well shown in the beautiful\r\ntravertine and sinter deposits of the Yellowstone Park (Figs. 215 and\r\n218). At the Mammoth Hot Springs the deposits are calcareous, while\r\nat most of the other hot springs silicious deposits are formed, in\r\nboth cases partly, but not wholly, by the aid of algæ. The beautiful\r\nyellows, reds, browns, and greens of these springs are not mineral\r\ncoloring, but living plants.[291] In the calcareous waters, the algæ\r\nare believed to cause the deposition of calcium carbonate from calcium\r\nbicarbonate by consuming the second equivalent of carbon dioxide\r\nthat rendered the carbonate soluble.[292] In the silicious waters,\r\nthe process of deposition is not understood. Similar deposits by the\r\naid of algæ take place in the geyser regions of Iceland and of New\r\nZealand, in the hot springs of Carlsbad, where they have been well\r\nstudied by Cohn,[292] and in most other hot springs. The same, or very\r\nsimilar, forms of algæ abound in nearly all waters, fresh and salt,\r\nbut the question whether they make calcareous and silicious deposits\r\nin notable quantity appears not to have received as yet the critical\r\ninvestigation its importance deserves, except in a few special cases.\r\nIt is clear, however, that in the cool waters such deposits do not\r\nreach the conspicuous amounts that they attain in the thermal springs.\r\nIn the shallow waters of the ocean, especially in the warmer regions,\r\nlime-secreting algæ are abundant and make large contributions to the\r\nlime deposits.\r\n\r\nAmong the higher algæ are the lime-secreting corallines or nullipores\r\n(Rhodophyceæ, red algæ), once regarded as animals, which contribute\r\na notable part of the calcareous substance of coral reefs. They are\r\nimportant geologic agents in the temperate and tropical seas, and have\r\nbeen traced as far back in time as the early Paleozoic era.\r\n\r\nThe Challenger reports[293] describe two forms of minute calcareous\r\nspherical organisms, Rhabdospheres and Coccospheres, as very\r\nabundant in the surface-waters of the temperate and tropical seas,\r\nand as important in contributing to the calcareous deposits of the\r\nsea-bottoms. The affinities of these bodies are in doubt, but they are\r\nregarded by Murray as probably pelagic algæ.\r\n\r\nThe stoneworts (Characeæ), an aberrant group of algæ inhabiting fresh\r\nand brackish water, secrete notable quantities of calcium carbonate\r\nin and around their tissues, and the accumulation of these gives rise\r\nto marl or limestone. It has recently been urged that our so-called\r\nshell-marls are mainly due to Charæ,[294] the molluscan shells being\r\nincidental rather than essential constituents.\r\n\r\nIn very ancient and also in some of the later strata, there are\r\nlimestones that do not carry any visible fossils, and their origin is,\r\ntherefore, debatable. There are also not a few limestones that are made\r\nup of a fine-grained base through which are scattered molluscan shells,\r\ncorals, etc., in a fine state of preservation. The condition of these\r\nfossils bears rather adversely on the view that shells, etc., have been\r\npowdered in sufficient numbers and to a sufficient degree to form the\r\ncompact base. In all these cases the usual explanations leave something\r\nto be desired. It is worth considering whether low forms of plants may\r\nnot be among the undemonstrated agents in forming these apparently\r\nunfossiliferous limestones or parts of limestones. The calcium\r\ncarbonate deposited by the algæ is in minute and delicate form, and is\r\nusually crystalline while yet in the living tissues. It is, therefore,\r\neasily subject to comminution and to such further crystallization as\r\nwould obscure the minute features that constitute the evidences of\r\nalgal origin.\r\n\r\nThe more complex and conspicuous algæ, the seaweeds, have left\r\nimpressions of their stems and fronds on the marine beds of most of the\r\nperiods, but they are usually obscure. Seaweeds are perhaps the source\r\nof the vegetal matter in certain carbonaceous shales and limestones. As\r\nseaweeds extract bromine and iodine and certain metallic ingredients\r\nfrom the sea-water, some of the iodine and bromine springs issuing from\r\nancient marine deposits, and certain ores, may owe their origin to\r\nancient seaweeds.\r\n\r\nDiatoms, minute plants of the Thallophyte group, secrete a delicate\r\nframework of silica which becomes a contribution to the silicious\r\ndeposits. Diatoms have sometimes contributed the material for very\r\nconsiderable beds, such as those of the ooze-bogs now forming in the\r\nmarshes of the geyser basins of the Yellowstone Park,[295] and the\r\ndiatom oozes of the deep sea (Fig. 353, p. 425).\r\n\r\nFungi, for obvious reasons, have left but scant traces of themselves.\r\n\r\nBacteria are believed to be recognizable as far back as the Paleozoic\r\nera. They are now the chief agents in the decomposition of organic\r\nmatter, and may be regarded as the prime enemies of the fossil record.\r\nIt is probable that similar decomposition took place actively in the\r\nearliest ages, for otherwise the remains of the ancient organisms\r\nshould be more abundant. There is hence a theoretical probability that\r\nbacteria flourished as far back as the stratigraphic record goes.\r\nNot unlikely they were originally simple algæ that turned from the\r\nprimitive habit of making their own food, to living on other organisms\r\nor their remains, and in so doing lost their power of manufacturing\r\nchlorophyll and of using inorganic carbon compounds. Their remarkable\r\nadaptation to the most varied conditions, and their extraordinary\r\nability to endure the greatest vicissitudes of environment, support the\r\nview that they are a very ancient and plastic form.\r\n\r\nAt present certain bacteria are important to higher vegetation because\r\nof their ability to use the free nitrogen of the atmosphere and to\r\ncombine it into forms available for the higher plants. It is not\r\nimprobable that they have subserved this important function through\r\nall the known ages. Some experiments seem to show that certain of the\r\nexisting algæ have this power, and possibly the ancestral forms of\r\nplants possessed it. The bacteria, being a derived and not an original\r\nform, could not have performed the function for the first plants. It is\r\npossible, of course, that the inorganic supply of nitrogen compounds\r\nwas sufficient for plant life at the outset.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses).=—The mosses\r\nand liverworts have left no certain record of their work in the\r\nearlier and middle geologic eras, and, if they existed at all, their\r\ncontributions were unimportant. Although low forms of plant life,\r\nthey are not primitive ones, as they are characterized by a definite\r\nalternation of generations implying a considerable time antecedent to\r\nthe attainment of their present forms; hence there are no very cogent\r\ntheoretical reasons for assigning them a place in early geologic\r\nhistory, though their absence cannot be affirmed. Some botanists think\r\nthe Pteridophytes were derived from some ancestral form of liverwort,\r\nwhich, if true, would require the presence of the latter in an early\r\ngeologic period; but the negative geological evidence relative to\r\ntheir presence favors the alternative view that the Pteridophytes were\r\nderived from some form of the Thallophytes by an independent line. In\r\nrecent times, certain of the mosses, especially the sphagnum mosses,\r\nhave played a notable part in the formation of peat accumulations. For\r\nthis, their habit of growing in bogs, and of dying below while they\r\ncontinue to grow above admirably fits them.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Pteridophytes (ferns, horsetails, lycopods,\r\nSphenophyllum).=—The Pteridophytes include the most important fossil\r\nplants of the earlier and middle geologic eras. To them we owe chiefly\r\nthe great carbonaceous deposits of the Coal Measures and probably\r\nmost of the disseminated carbons of the early and middle eras;\r\nperhaps also much of the natural oil and gas. Their special work is\r\nso conspicuous that it will be noted at length in the chapters on\r\nthe Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and hence may be passed here\r\nwith brevity. The ferns, now known more for their beauty than their\r\nimportance, are the representative type of the group, and are really\r\na wonderful family, having preserved their characteristic leaf-forms\r\nwith a persistence attained by no other group of plants. The Paleozoic\r\nferns are recognizable as such by every one, irrespective of botanical\r\nknowledge; indeed it is the detection of the differences, rather than\r\nthe resemblances, between the ancient and modern forms, that requires\r\nexpert knowledge. This continuity shows that since their introduction\r\nthe changes of climate have never been so great as to prevent their\r\npropagation, without radical modification, in some part of the globe,\r\nand this fact rather narrowly limits the range of surface temperatures,\r\nand of other climatic vicissitudes. The persistence of the Equisetæ\r\n(horsetails, scouring-rushes) and the lycopods (club-mosses) bears\r\nlike testimony, as does the persistence of life in general; but the\r\nrather delicate ferns are perhaps more obviously significant than most\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Spermatophytes (seed plants, including\r\ngymnosperms or “evergreens” and angiosperms or “flowering\r\nplants”).=—The angiosperms, the dominant group to-day, make their\r\nappearance in the record in the latter part of the Mesozoic era, and\r\ntheir contribution is, therefore, relatively modern. They contributed\r\nto the coals, lignites, oils, and organic gases of the late geological\r\nperiods, as did the Pteridophytes in the earlier periods, the\r\nlatter participating, however, in the late deposits. Perhaps the\r\nmost important function of the Spermatophytes lay in their superior\r\nserviceability as food for the higher land animals, by virtue of their\r\nseeds, fruits, and foliage. Neither the Thallophytes, Bryophytes, nor\r\nPteridophytes, nor all combined, approach the Spermatophytes in food\r\nvalue for the higher types of animal life, and it is doubtful whether\r\nthe higher evolution of the land animals could have taken place without\r\nthe previous introduction of the seed plants. It will be noted in the\r\nhistorical narrative that the great placental group of mammals came in\r\nand deployed with marvelous rapidity, as geological progress goes, soon\r\nafter the Spermatophytes became the dominant form of vegetation.\r\n\r\n=Plant life terrestrial rather than marine.=—It is to be noticed that\r\nthe chief development of all the great groups of plants took place\r\non the land, or in the land-waters, rather than in the sea. This is\r\npreeminently true of the higher types, and appears also to be true of\r\neven the Thallophytes, although the number of individual algæ and their\r\ntotal mass is very much greater in the sea than on the land and in the\r\nland-waters. But the fresh-water algæ appear to possess in a higher\r\ndegree than the marine forms those plastic and germinal characters\r\nfrom which new forms spring, and are probably to be regarded as the\r\nparental type. These are facts to be pondered on, since it has been\r\nthe current opinion of geologists that life arose in the sea and was\r\npropagated thence to the land. The alternative view that life developed\r\nprimarily on the land and in the land-waters and migrated to the sea is\r\nnot, however, without its support in the plant world, as we thus see,\r\nand the plant world was the primitive one; the dependent animal world\r\nnecessarily followed its development. The hypothesis of a terrestrial\r\norigin of life throws a very suggestive cross-light on many geological\r\nproblems, as will be seen later, and it may well be entertained as an\r\nalternative working hypothesis until the facts are more fully developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n            B. +Contributions of the Animal Kingdom.+[296]\r\n\r\nAs already noted, animal life is dependent on the decomposition of\r\nmatter organized by green plants, and the conversion of its potential\r\nenergy into active forms. Animals are, therefore, dynamic rather than\r\nconstructive agencies. Nevertheless they transform organic vegetal\r\nmatter into organic animal matter, and this is sometimes really an\r\nadvance in organization. The organized animal matter is subject to\r\npreservation in some small degree, though it usually perishes. Some\r\ncontribution is, therefore, made to the organic deposits, chiefly in\r\nthe form of hydrocarbons. It is the view of some geologists that the\r\nnatural oils and gases have an animal origin in the main.\r\n\r\n\r\n       REFERENCE TABLE OF THE PRINCIPAL GROUPS OF ANIMALS.[297]\r\n\r\n+Protozoa+      {             Rhizopoda  { Foraminifera.\r\n  (The simplest {                        { Radiolaria.\r\n    animals)    {\r\n                {             Flagellata }\r\n                {             Infusoria  } Unknown in fossil state.\r\n                {             Gregarina  }\r\n\r\n+Cœlenterata+   { Porifera    Spongiæ    { Calcareous sponges.\r\n  (Sponges,     {                        { Silicious sponges.\r\n   corals,      { Cnidaria   { Anthozoa, coral polyps.\r\n   jellyfishes) {            { Hydrozoa, hydroids and medusæ.\r\n\r\n+Echinodermata+ { Pelmatozoa { Cystoidea, cystids.\r\n  (Crinoids,    {            { Crinoidea, stone lilies.\r\n   starfishes,  {            { Blastoidea, blastids.\r\n   sea-urchins) {\r\n                { Asterozoa  { Ophiuroidea, brittle-stars\r\n                {            { Asteroidea, starfishes.\r\n                {\r\n                { Echinozoa  { Echinoidea, sea-urchins.\r\n                {            { Holothuroidea, sea-cucumbers.\r\n\r\n+Vermes+                     { Platyhelminthes }\r\n  (Worms)                    { Rotifera        }\r\n                             { Nemathelminthes } Rare as fossils.\r\n                             { Gephyrea        }\r\n                             {\r\n                             { Annelida, sea-worms.\r\n\r\n+Molluscoidea+               { Bryozoa, sea-mosses.\r\n  (Mollusc-like forms)       { Brachiopoda, lamp-shells.\r\n\r\n+Mollusca+                   { Pelecypoda, lamellibranchs, bivalves.\r\n  (Molluscs)                 { Scaphopoda, tusk-shells.\r\n                             { Amphineura, chiton.\r\n                             { Gastropoda, univalves, snails, etc.\r\n                             { Cephalopoda, nautilus, cuttlefish.\r\n\r\n+Arthropoda+    { Branchiata { Crustacea.\r\n  (The          {            {   Trilobita, trilobites.\r\n   articulates) {            {   Gigantostraca, horse-shoe crabs.\r\n                {            {   Entomostraca, ostracoids, barnacles.\r\n                {            {   Malacostraca, lobsters, crabs.\r\n                {\r\n                { Tracheata  { Myriapoda, centipedes.\r\n                             { Arachnoidea, spiders, scorpions.\r\n                             { Insecta, insects.\r\n\r\n                             { Cyclostomata, lampreys.\r\n                             {\r\n                             { Pisces     { Selachii, sharks.\r\n                             {   (fishes) { Holocephali, spook-fishes.\r\n                             {            { Dipnoi, lung-fishes.\r\n                             {            { Teleostomi, ganoids and teleosus.\r\n                             {            { (common fishes).\r\n+Vertebrata+                 {\r\n                             { Amphibia, amphibians, batrachians.\r\n                             { Reptilia, reptiles.\r\n                             { Aves, birds.\r\n                             { Mammalia   { Prototheria, monotremes.\r\n                             {   (mammals){ Metatheria, marsupials.\r\n                             {            { Eutheria, placentals.\r\n\r\nAs dynamic organisms animals have need for supporting- and\r\nworking-frames, for protective covering or housing, and for offensive\r\nand defensive weapons, and these have been constructed chiefly out of\r\ninorganic matter, and subordinately of indurated organic matter. It is\r\nthrough these that animals have made their chief contribution to the\r\nmaterial of the geologic record. Skeletons and other hard parts to give\r\ninternal stiffness or firmness; shells, plates, indurated integuments,\r\nand various other forms of external protection; teeth, spines, horns,\r\nand other means of gathering and masticating food, and of attack and\r\ndefense, contribute material to the deposits, and form a record of the\r\nlife activities and of the physiographic environment. All of the eight\r\ngroups of animals, viz. Protozoa, Cœlenterata, Echinodermata, Vermes,\r\nMolluscoidea, Mollusca, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata, have left some\r\nrecord, but it is in all cases a very imperfect one.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Protozoa.=—The Protozoa are related to the\r\nanimal kingdom much as the Thallophytes are to the vegetable, and\r\nthe two bear a close structural resemblance to one another. So near,\r\nindeed, do the Protozoa and the Thallophytes approach one another in\r\ntheir minuteness and simplicity, that the place of not a few organisms\r\nis in doubt, and the two kingdoms, in general so different, seem here\r\nto blend in the group Flagellata. The Protozoa are usually very minute\r\none-celled organisms with very little differentiation of tissue or\r\norgans. Of the four classes of Protozoa, only one, the Rhizopoda, is\r\nfound in the fossil state. The rhizopods secrete silicious skeletons,\r\nand calcareous, silicious, and chitinous tests of a great variety of\r\nforms, and this gives them geologic importance. The deep-sea oozes and\r\nthe chalk deposits are their best-known contributions at present. They\r\nhave probably played a more important rôle in the formation of ordinary\r\nlimestones and silicious silts than can be demonstrated, because of the\r\ndelicacy of their relics and the ease with which these are pulverized\r\nby wave-action in the shallow seas, or changed by recrystallization\r\nor by concretionary aggregation. The globigerina oozes are formed\r\nlargely from the calcareous shells of Foraminifera (Fig. 351), one\r\nof the orders of rhizopods, among which the genus Globigerina is a\r\nleading form. Those forms which make the deep-sea oozes live, not on\r\nthe bottom, but near the surface of the open sea, and on the death of\r\nthe organisms, the shells, tests, and skeletons sink to the bottom.\r\nChalk is formed in a similar way from calcareous Foraminifera, but not\r\nnecessarily in very deep water. Foraminifera live in shallow water as\r\nwell as in the open sea, and in this case they sometimes creep on the\r\nbottom or are attached to algæ, but their deposits in shallow water are\r\nusually much obscured by other kinds of deposition and by destructive\r\naction. Some of the foraminiferal shells are divided into chambers and\r\nassume various spiral forms, of which the _Nummulites_, named from\r\ntheir resemblance to coins, are notable examples. These formed an\r\nimportant part of the nummulitic limestone of the Eocene period.\r\n\r\nThe radiolarian ooze is characterized by the silicious tests of various\r\nmembers of the silica-bearing order, Radiolaria. The “Barbadoes earth”\r\nand “Tripoli” are notable deposits of fossil radiolarians.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Cœlenterata.=—The Cœlenterata embrace the\r\nsponges, the coral polyps (Anthozoa), and the hydroids and medusæ\r\n(Hydrozoa). The contribution of coral polyps to the formation of\r\nlimestone is most important, and is too familiar to require elaboration\r\nhere. The corals range throughout nearly the whole fossiliferous\r\nseries, and their development will be followed and illustrated in the\r\nhistorical chapters.\r\n\r\nThe sponges are widely represented by their spicules, and not\r\nuncommonly their aggregate form is preserved even in very ancient\r\nstrata. Their contribution is largely silicious, but is partly\r\ncalcareous. The hydroids and medusæ have left little trace of\r\nthemselves in the rocks, although impressions supposed to represent\r\nmedusæ are found in strata as early as the Cambrian. Certain coral-like\r\nforms, as the Millepores, Tubularia, and Stromatopora, are classed as\r\nHydrozoa. The graptolites, delicate leaf-like floating forms, very\r\nserviceable in marking exact horizons on different continents because\r\nof their free distribution, are also classed here.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Echinodermata.=—Under the echinoderms are\r\ngrouped the crinoids (sea-lilies), cystoids, blastoids, ophiuroids\r\n(brittle stars), asteroids (starfishes), echinoids (sea-urchins),\r\nand holothuroids (sea-cucumbers). This is one of the marked groups\r\nof ancient as well as modern life, and its beautiful fossils grace\r\nevery period in which life relics are well preserved. The cystoids and\r\ncrinoids, and later the blastoids, were prominent in the Paleozoic\r\nages, while the remaining forms were more conspicuous later, though\r\nearly introduced. All divisions, except the holothuroids, whose\r\nsoftness prevented, have left a good record, as fossil records go.\r\nTheir relics are chiefly calcareous, and they most abound in the\r\nlimestones, some of which are largely made up of their remains, as the\r\nencrinital limestone (Fig. 349). They will be subjects of frequent\r\ncomment and illustration in the historical chapters.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Vermes.=—Most of the worms are ill adapted to\r\nfossilization and are not known in the fossil form. The segmental worms\r\nof the sea, the annelids, however, left some traces of themselves in\r\ntubes and borings and in tracks and sometimes by fossil jaws and teeth.\r\nThey range from the earliest fossil-marked horizons onward, but seem to\r\nhave always been an inferior group.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Molluscoidea.=—This group includes the\r\nbryozoans, whose fossil products closely resemble the minute-celled\r\ncorals, and the brachiopods, whose shells closely resemble those of\r\nthe molluscs. Both are calcareous and make important contributions\r\nto the formation of limestone (Fig. 350). A few brachiopods secrete\r\ncalcium phosphate instead of calcium carbonate. Both classes have a\r\ngreat geologic range and their fossils are valuable aids in identifying\r\nand correlating formations. Probably the brachiopods are more utilized\r\nfor this purpose than any other single class. They are the symbol of\r\nconservatism and persistence, ranging from the Cambrian to the present\r\ntime, and embracing some forms that have scarcely changed to the extent\r\nof generic difference in that time.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Mollusca.=—The molluscs have also ranged from\r\nthe earliest well-recorded times, and some divisions, as the pelecypods\r\n(lamellibranchs, embracing clams, oysters, etc.) and gastropods\r\n(snails, etc.), have undergone no very marked change beyond a rather\r\nample and progressive development; but others, as the cephalopods\r\n(nautilus, squids, cuttlefish, etc.), mark out the progress of the ages\r\nby distinct and striking changes of form. Their shells are chiefly\r\ncalcareous and they have contributed materially to the formation of\r\nlimestone. Muddy and sandy bottoms are, however, more congenial to the\r\npelecypods and gastropods than to the corals, crinoids, and many other\r\nlimestone-forming types, and hence fossils of these molluscs frequently\r\nabound in shales and sandstones and give them a calcareous element. In\r\nsandstones, however, the calcareous matter is often dissolved out and\r\nonly the casts of the shells remain. The molluscs will be much cited\r\nand illustrated in the historical chapters.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Arthropoda.=—This group embraces the\r\ncrustaceans, myriopods, spiders, and insects. The hard parts of their\r\nbodies are mainly horny or chitinous forms of organic matter, and hence\r\ntheir relics differ notably from the inorganic calcareous and silicious\r\nremains of most of the preceding forms. The Arthropoda did not at\r\nany time form a notable stratum of rock. Their geologic value lies\r\nchiefly in what they teach of the progress of life and its relations,\r\nand the aid they render in correlation and identification. In these\r\nrespects the group is a notable one. It was represented in the early\r\nfossiliferous strata by the trilobites, one of the most interesting of\r\nall types of fossils. These were probably the most highly developed\r\norganisms of their times and give the clearest hints of the stage of\r\npsychological and sociological development that had been reached when\r\nfirst the record of life is opened to us. The record of the myriopods,\r\nspiders, and insects dates from the middle Paleozoic, and gives the\r\nfirst clear hints of animal life on the land.\r\n\r\n=The contribution of the Vertebrata.=—In the vertebrates the dynamic or\r\nworking organism may be said to reach its highest expression, unless\r\nit be in the flying insects, and their inorganic residue becomes\r\nrelatively unimportant in rock formation. Although the greatest of all\r\nanimal types in most respects, it has never formed more than trivial\r\nbeds of rocks. There are occasional “bone beds,” but they are thin and\r\nlimited in extent, and only partially formed of vertebrate matter. The\r\ngeological importance of the vertebrates lies in the higher field of\r\nlife evolution and in its mental accompaniment. Fishes excepted, the\r\nvertebrates are mainly land types, and have for their chief colleagues\r\nplants and insects. The other groups of animals are mainly, though not\r\nwholly, marine. The vertebrates have little place in the Paleozoic\r\nrecord, except near its close, but they dominate the Mesozoic and\r\nCenozoic eras, and are conspicuously the master type to day.\r\n\r\n\r\n        III. THE ASSOCIATIONS AND ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n                 A. +The Basis of Floras and Faunas.+\r\n\r\nGeologic interest is not confined to the kinds of plants and animals\r\nthat have lived and the contributions they have made to the deposits,\r\nbut embraces also their assemblage into floras and faunas, and the\r\nrelations of these assemblages to the prevailing physiographic\r\nfeatures. These assemblages and relationships are among the most\r\nsuggestive factors of the earth’s evolution, and are the most\r\ninstructive for purposes of comparison with human history, and for\r\nforecasting the future of man and of the whole biological kingdom.\r\nMoreover, floras and faunas, as such, are used in the correlation\r\nof formations, and in this application they give surer results than\r\ncorrelations by individual species. A particular species may live\r\nfar beyond the usual period of a species, and if fossilized in one\r\nregion in its early history and in another in its late history, the\r\ntwo formations might be referred erroneously to the same stage. This\r\nis far less likely to happen with a whole assemblage of forms. There\r\nis a similar liability to error in interpreting migrations on the\r\nbasis of a single or a few species, for a single species or a few\r\nspecies may be transported by unusual or accidental means, so to speak,\r\nwhen there is no normal pathway for general migration, and when no\r\nsystematic migration takes place. In most of the great questions that\r\narise concerning the connections and disseverances of the continents,\r\nand concerning the unions and separations of the oceans, which are the\r\nfundamental causes of the migrations and of the isolations of plants\r\nand animals, typical floras and faunas are to be studied, rather than\r\nisolated species or sporadic forms. A brief sketch of the leading\r\ncauses and consequences of these special assemblages of plants and\r\nanimals may aid in appreciating the underlying significance of floras\r\nand faunas, and in interpreting their meaning as they are met in the\r\nstudy of the strata. A part of these grow out of the relations of\r\nthe organisms to one another, and a part out of the relations of the\r\norganisms to their environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) _Assemblages Influenced by the Mutual Relations of Organisms._\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Food relations.=—The relations of food-supply are among the most\r\nobvious reasons for assemblages. As animals are dependent directly\r\nor indirectly on plants for their food, they must gather where the\r\nplants grow, or in the currents in which the plant products are borne.\r\nWhatever determines an assemblage of plants also causes, or at least\r\ninvites, an assemblage of animals. Whatever causes an assemblage of\r\nparticular plants, invites an assemblage of the particular animals\r\nthat use these plants. Animals that feed on plants are in turn preyed\r\nupon by other animals, and these in turn by others. A whole train of\r\norganisms may, therefore, be gathered into a region by the conditions\r\nthat foster a certain kind of vegetation there. In interpreting the\r\nphysical significance of such a train, it is obvious that the head of\r\nthe train carries the fundamental meaning. The dependent creatures\r\nthat follow the primary forms may be only incidentally, and perhaps\r\nvery slightly, adapted to the physical environment.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Adaptive relations.=—Organisms depending on other organisms\r\nfor food or other necessary conditions of life, present many forms\r\nof adaptation the better to secure their food and to use it. These\r\nadaptations are the consequences and the signs of the assemblage, and\r\nare of the greatest service in interpreting the place and significance\r\nof the organisms in the assemblage. Teeth usually reveal the food\r\nof their possessors, and hence teeth are among the most significant\r\nof fossils. Fortunately their functions require them to be hard and\r\ndurable, and hence well suited to fossilization. The growth of low\r\nplants into trees forced a notable series of adaptations in the animals\r\nthat fed upon them in the matter of height, of reaching members, of\r\nclimbing, and probably at length of parachuting and flying. In these\r\nand similar ways the floras and faunas took on special phases because\r\nof the mutual relations of their members.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Competitive relations.=—The assembling of plants and animals,\r\nwith their prodigious possibilities of multiplication, brought\r\ncompetition, and with it a struggle for food which often became a\r\nstruggle for existence, and out of this grew innumerable modifications\r\nof form and habit. These have become so familiar since the great\r\nawakening caused by the doctrines of Darwin and Wallace that they need\r\nno elaboration here.\r\n\r\n(_d_) =Offensive and defensive relations.=—Within limits, plants are\r\nbenefited by the feeding of animals and respond by developing seeds and\r\nfruits that especially invite such action, their compensation being\r\nfound in planting and distribution. It is obvious that, on the whole,\r\nthe continued growth of plants is largely dependent on the renewal of a\r\nsupply of carbon dioxide through the agency of animals and some plants,\r\nbacteria in particular. Otherwise the supply would become so reduced as\r\nto greatly limit plant life. It has been estimated[298] that the whole\r\nof the present supply of carbon dioxide would be consumed by plants in\r\none hundred years if the consumption continued at the present rate and\r\nno carbon dioxide was returned. It is now well known that the so-called\r\ndecay by which carbon dioxide is freed is due more to microscopic\r\norganisms than to inorganic processes. It seems clear, therefore, that\r\nthe continued activity of plants is largely due to their consumption\r\nby animals and other plants. But still, though the larger good of\r\nplants is conserved by the predaceous action of animals, and of certain\r\nparasitic and saprophytic plants, their individual preservation\r\nis often conserved by defensive devices, such as thorns, poisons,\r\nbitter compounds, etc. This is notably true in desert regions where\r\nthe conditions are hard and the total extinction of plants would be\r\nthreatened if animals were permitted to feed freely upon them. Within\r\nthe animal world, the preying of one form upon another is the main\r\nsource of that great struggle for existence which has characterized\r\nthe whole known history of life, and has been one of the influential\r\nfactors in shaping the evolution of life and in modifying the special\r\naspects assumed by the floras and faunas of each period.\r\n\r\n=Implied forms of life.=—The full meaning of the fossils of any period\r\ncan only be gathered by duly considering these relationships in their\r\ninterpretation. The existence of animals implies the existence of\r\nplants in supporting abundance, whether the record contains their\r\nrelics or not; an animal with a protective covering implies an enemy;\r\na tooth of a specific kind implies the appropriate class of food,\r\netc. While inferences of this kind are subject to error, they are at\r\npresent the only means by which the faunas and floras of most ages\r\ncan be rounded out into a rational assemblage of organisms, that is,\r\nan assemblage that affords the necessary food for its members and\r\nan adequate function for the offensive and defensive devices which\r\nits members present. Only a small part of the life that lived was\r\nfossilized, and only a small part of the fossils actually carried\r\nin the strata have been collected, because only a small part of the\r\nstrata are exposed at the surface. The direct record now accessible\r\nis, therefore, very incomplete and hence the need—and in the need the\r\nexcuse—for adding the forms that are implied by the character of the\r\nknown fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (2) _Assemblages Influenced by Environment._\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that some animals depend for existence on other\r\nanimals; that ultimately all animals depend on plants, and that green\r\nplants alone can make food directly from inorganic material. Green\r\nplants, therefore, head the train of dependencies, and their relations\r\nto the physical conditions that surround them are the primal relations.\r\n\r\n=Plant societies.=[299]—The control of physical conditions has been\r\nsufficient to develop special associations or societies of plants by\r\nfostering those adapted to these conditions and eliminating those\r\nthat are not. Among these are (1) the hydrophytes (“water plants”),\r\nembracing those that grow in water or in very wet situations; (2)\r\nxerophytes (“drought plants”), embracing the opposite class, which are\r\nadapted to very dry situations; (3) mesophytes, including those suited\r\nto conditions lying between these extremes, the great middle class to\r\nwhich the prevailing upland vegetation belongs; and (4) the halophytes\r\n(“salt plants”), which are dependent on the presence of certain salts,\r\nand embrace such plants as are found on the seacoast, around salt\r\nsprings, on alkaline flats, etc. The characters which distinguish the\r\nxerophytes from the hydrophytes and mesophytes have special geological\r\ninterest, as they aid in determining the climatic conditions, a feature\r\nwhose interest increases as the variability of the ancient climates is\r\nmore fully recognized.\r\n\r\nWithin these greater groups there are special minor associations\r\ndetermined by soil, temperature, topography, subjacent strata, and\r\nby the relations of the plants to one another.[300] These natural\r\ngroups are valuable indications of the agricultural capabilities of\r\nthe districts occupied by them. They may be regarded as the outcome of\r\nNature’s experiments in crop-raising, running consecutively through\r\nthousands of years. They are natural correlations of compatible members\r\ninto communities of plants. Some members of the society are obviously\r\ndependent on others, as certain forms of undergrowth on the shadowing\r\nof the upper growth, as of vines upon supporting-trees, etc. There is\r\nprobably a more occult relation in some cases, the effects of certain\r\nplants on the soil being sometimes advantageous to other plants, and\r\nsometimes harmful, as illustrated in the conditions that require a\r\nrotation of crops.\r\n\r\nThe chief point of geologic interest lies in the fact that floras\r\nare not mere miscellaneous mixtures of plants that happen to live\r\nin a given area at a given period, but are organized communities,\r\nin a more or less definite sense. They therefore imply more or less\r\ndefinitely the physical conditions which are congenial to them, and\r\nthus furnish the basis for interpreting such conditions in the past, so\r\nfar as the floras are well preserved. The faunas, especially the land\r\nfaunas, being primarily dependent on the floras, furnish a basis for\r\ninterpretations of like import.\r\n\r\n\r\n    B. +The Influence of Geographic Conditions on the Evolution of\r\n                          Floras and Faunas.+\r\n\r\nThe geographic features of the earth impose on organisms a complex\r\nseries of influences which modify the evolution of life and produce\r\nfaunal and floral variation on a large scale. The larger assemblages of\r\nlife, which inhabit a continent or dwell in a great sea, are designated\r\nfaunas and floras, as well as the smaller assemblages just discussed,\r\nbut obviously in a broader and in a different sense. The disseverance\r\nof the land by the sea, or of the sea by the land, isolates the life\r\nand forces independent development. The introduction of cold zones,\r\ndesert tracts, or other potent climatic belts has somewhat the same\r\neffect. So, measurably, does the raising of a mountain range or a\r\nplateau, or the sinking of critical portions of the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\n=The development of provincial and cosmopolitan faunas.=[301]—If a\r\nregion is isolated from other regions by the cutting off of all ready\r\nmeans of intermigration, as by the formation of an island from what\r\nhad been a peninsula, or of an inland sea from what had been a bay,\r\nthe flora and fauna are developed by themselves without much influx of\r\nother forms, and hence become local or provincial. This is usually more\r\nmarked in the case of the fauna than of the flora, because the latter\r\nhas more ample means of dispersion, on the whole, and so the fauna may\r\nfor convenience be taken as the type. A good illustration is the native\r\nfauna of Australia which was once connected with Asia, but has long\r\nbeen separated from it. Previous to importations by man, this continent\r\nhad a very peculiar and distinct fauna, descended from its Mesozoic\r\ninhabitants. Most of the isolated islands have peculiar faunas, but in\r\nmany cases they were isolated from the beginning, having been built up\r\nby volcanic action from the bottom of the sea, and their faunas are\r\ndue to the accidents of transportation and to the development of these\r\nsporadic forms in isolation.[302]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that whenever any geographic change introduces a\r\nbarrier to migration, the faunas of the dissevered portions will, in\r\nall probability, develop along different lines, and will diverge into\r\nprovincial faunas. On the other hand, any geographic change that unites\r\nareas and leads to intermigration, tends to a community of fauna or to\r\ncosmopolitanism. These tendencies have been markedly felt all through\r\nthe geologic ages, and constitute one of the most vital features of\r\ntheir history. When continents are connected, their faunas intermingle\r\nand the exchange gives rise to common forms. They tend to blend into\r\none great fauna except so far as the local differences develop those\r\nminor assemblages previously discussed. When continents are separated,\r\nthey tend to develop peculiar faunas, as do islands, but on a larger\r\nscale. This is very obvious in the case of the land life, but needs\r\nmore special statement for the oceans.\r\n\r\nThe oceans constitute a single body of water with ample connections and\r\nstirred by a system of constant circulation. Probably this has been\r\ntrue for most of known geologic time. A single cosmopolitan fauna of\r\nthe largest type might be expected. This is in a measure realized in\r\nthe pelagic fauna of the open ocean, though this is somewhat modified\r\nby the climatic zones. But the marine faunas that are fossilized in\r\nthe known strata, and have most geologic interest, are, with rare\r\nexceptions, not those of the open ocean, but those of the shore zones\r\nand of the shallow seas. Now, although these shore belts and shallow\r\nseas are broadly connected with the great ocean body, and are usually\r\nregarded as a part of it, they are singularly separated from it,\r\nor rather they are singularly separated by it, so far as the life\r\ndependent on shallow-water conditions is concerned. To this life, the\r\ndeep sea is a barrier not quite as effective as the land, but still a\r\nbarrier. The key to this important fact may be found in a consideration\r\nof _the vertical distribution of life_.\r\n\r\nThe great horizon of life is at or near the contact zone of the\r\natmosphere with the hydrosphere and lithosphere. Life declines with\r\nincreasing altitude, partly because of the lowering temperature,\r\nand partly because of the increasing tenuity of the atmosphere.\r\nThe successive changes of plant and animal life with the ascent of\r\nmountains and plateaus is familiar. Life declines in descent into the\r\nsea chiefly from lack of light, and secondarily from the lowering of\r\ntemperature. Light is essential to the formation of chlorophyll and,\r\nthrough it, of all other organic compounds. The chlorophyll-forming\r\nplants are, therefore, limited to such depths as are penetrated by the\r\nrays necessary for the photosynthesis of organic matter. Vision is cut\r\noff within 200 to 300 feet, and most plant growth takes place above\r\nthat depth. Photographic effects become feeble or inappreciable at 1000\r\nto 1200 feet.[303] The photosynthesis of plants is chiefly aided by the\r\nlower and middle part of the spectrum, while the ordinary photographic\r\nwork is chiefly done by the upper end, so that the photographic limit\r\nis below the photosynthetic limit. Microscopic plants are sometimes\r\nfound lower than these limits, but they may have been carried below\r\ntheir working limits by currents or other incidental agencies. For\r\nall general purposes, the limiting depth of living carbon-compounding\r\nplants may be set at 100 fathoms, as a generous figure—about the\r\naverage depth of the border of the continental shelf—while the vast\r\nmajority flourish only in the upper third of this depth.\r\n\r\nLife does not cease here, for the products of this surface-life sink\r\nto greater depths and are fed upon by forms of sea animals that have\r\nbecome adapted to the dark and cold abyss of the ocean. Obviously,\r\nthese deep-sea forms are a very distinct type of life, and constitute a\r\nfauna of the most pronounced kind, the abysmal fauna. Another distinct\r\nfauna occupies the open-ocean surface, the pelagic fauna. Still a\r\nthird fauna occupies the shallow-water tract, whose bottom lies within\r\nthe light zone—_the photobathic zone_—and embraces the animals that\r\nare dependent on the plants of this zone, or on its light and warmth,\r\nand that are more or less fixed to the bottom or confined to the zone\r\nbecause their food is there.\r\n\r\nThe physical plane of demarkation between the surface or pelagic fauna\r\nand the abysmal fauna is much more distinct and more fundamental than\r\nany that is found in ascending above the surface of the sea. The\r\nhabitat of the shallow-water fauna is limited below by the darkness,\r\nlimited above by the water-surface, limited at one side by the land,\r\nand limited on the other side by the deep sea. It is hemmed in\r\nvertically between two planes only a few hundred feet apart. Laterally,\r\nit is confined to a narrow belt about the borders of the continents and\r\nto the more or less land-girt epicontinental seas. Its vertical limits\r\nare fixed, but its lateral extent varies with the relations of the sea\r\nto the surface of the continental platforms.\r\n\r\nThis variation profoundly affects the development of the fauna. When a\r\nmajor deformation of the earth takes place which increases the capacity\r\nof the oceanic basins, the water is drawn down into them more fully,\r\nand correspondingly retreats from the continental shelf. The shore is\r\nthus carried out toward or to the border of the shelf, or even perhaps\r\ndown to some line on the abysmal slope. In either case, the zone of\r\nshallow water suited to the photobathic life is narrowed, and at points\r\nit may be practically cut in two. There are, however, shelves and\r\ntracts that were below the light zone before, which now are brought\r\nwithin it by the lowering of the sea-level. Into these, as into harbors\r\nof refuge, the life migrates so far as it may. But these tracts are\r\nless prevalent and continuous than the typical continental shelf, and\r\nunder the conditions supposed they would be but imperfectly connected\r\nwith each other by available shallow-water tracts. (The steep shelving\r\nshore tracts, although furnishing a shallow-water connection possibly\r\navailable for some species, would be unsuited to others and, under\r\ncertain conditions of the sea-currents, would be an effective barrier.)\r\nTo these limited tracts, therefore, the life of the photobathic type\r\nis restricted and measurably isolated, and develops into local and\r\nprovincial faunas.\r\n\r\nAfter a deforming movement has ceased, the seashore habitually\r\nadvances, developing a new continental shelf, and in time new\r\nepicontinental gulfs and seas. In this it is assisted by the erosion\r\nof the continent and the filling of the sea, and probably by the slow\r\nsettling of the continents. As the sea-shelf broadens, the isolated\r\ntracts, the harbors of refuge, become connected, and migration is\r\nfacilitated. When the connection becomes general and broad, and when\r\nepicontinental seas have formed available tracts across the face of the\r\ncontinents, a general commingling of faunas follows, and a cosmopolitan\r\nfauna results.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, but more obviously, when the land is extended and\r\nconnection between the continents becomes general, there is migration\r\nand commingling of the land faunas and floras, and cosmopolitan\r\ncommunities are the result.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the development on the land is the reciprocal of\r\nthat in the sea. When the seas are extended and their life is tending\r\ntoward cosmopolitanism, the lands are dissevered, and their life is\r\ntending toward provincialism, and _vice versa_. When, however, the land\r\nis greatly extended, it is usually accentuated by mountain ranges,\r\nand other products of the deformation which extended it, and these\r\nform barriers. Desert wastes and other inhospitable tracts, and even\r\nglaciation, are liable to develop as secondary consequences, and to\r\ninterpose barriers, and hence the cosmopolitanism of the land-life is\r\nliable to be less complete than that of the sea-life.\r\n\r\n=Restrictive and expansional evolution.=—It is obvious from the last\r\ndiscussion that if the picture of the earth’s movement above drawn\r\nbe true, the areas available for particular classes of life may vary\r\ngreatly from age to age. At times the shallow-water sea-life may be\r\nforced to retreat into a very narrow tract on the border of the land,\r\nand into chance expansions here and there. In being crowded into this\r\nlimited tract, perhaps also less adapted for a habitat on account of\r\nthe change, the life is subjected to severe competition and to hard\r\nconditions, and must experience in an intensified degree the effects\r\nof the struggle for existence. Whatever of evolutionary potency there\r\nmay be in such a struggle under such restrictive conditions should be\r\nrevealed in the modifications of the fauna that ensued.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the shallow seas are generally extending\r\nthemselves upon the land and the land is being base-leveled, and\r\nthus adapted to shallow submergence, the shallow-water life enjoys\r\nan enlarging realm, and should reveal the effects of evolution under\r\nexpansional conditions. In affording a comparison between these\r\nopposite and alternating phases of restrictional and expansional\r\nevolution, geology makes one of its great contributions to the external\r\ncauses and conditions of organic evolution. These will come under\r\nrepeated consideration in the historical chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n                               VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbot, M.

The stream is said to begin where the water appears\r\n  at the surface, though in some cases the water of the spring was a\r\n  subsurface stream before it reached the surface.

The\r\n  temperatures are the results of recent preliminary computations made\r\n  under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution, and are subject\r\n  to change on further study. They are based on the assumption that\r\n  the increase in density is due to compression. They are in general\r\n  accord with the results previously reached by Dr. F. R. Moulton\r\n  (see “A Group of Hypotheses Bearing on Climatic Changes,” by T. C.\r\n  Chamberlin, Jour. of Geol., 1897, p. 674). The Rev. O. Fisher, in the\r\n  Am.

Everett (Units and\r\n  Physical Constants) gives 837 × 10⁶ for steel, but as the modulus\r\n  for granite seems low, we have taken the lower estimate for steel to\r\n  avoid exaggerating the ratio between them.\r\n\r\n[270] Nat.

See also Fisher,\r\n  Physics of the Earth’s Crust, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[272] Of like import is the statement of Woodward—“If the crust of the\r\n  earth were self-supporting, its crushing strength would have to be\r\n  about thirty times that of the best cast steel, or five hundred to\r\n  one thousand times that of granite.” Mathematical Theories of the\r\n  Earth, Proc. Am. Assoc. for Adv. Sci., 1889, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[273] It is assumed that the direction of the supporting thrust at the\r\n  periphery of the dome is at every point parallel to the tangent to\r\n  the domed surface. This is justified by symmetry in the case of a\r\n  shell conforming to the sphericity of the earth, and in the other\r\n  cases it would seem to be as favorable an assumption in the direction\r\n  of high supporting capacity as can reasonably be made.\r\n\r\n[274] Prepared at the authors’ request by W.
