Gates, State Inspector of Apiaries\r\nin Massachusetts, and Prof. James E. Rice of the Department of Poultry\r\nHusbandry at Cornell University for reading the chapters on their\r\nspecialties and for numerous suggestions which make those chapters\r\nvaluable; and to many others from whom helpful ideas have come in\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD TO PARENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two sovereign cures for the ills of modern life: Work and\r\noutdoors. It is the purpose of this book on \"Outdoor Work for Young\r\nPeople\" to teach the gospel of these two remedies, not in lessons nor\r\nsermons, but in the form of confidential talks, which are intended to\r\nbe both practical and inspiring.\r\n\r\nThe guiding principles in the preparation of this book are three: 1, to\r\nhelp young people to earn money; 2, to help them build character; 3, to\r\nhelp them make better citizens.\r\n\r\n1. The most obvious reason why children wish to work is that they \"want\r\nto earn money,\" to spend as they like. Here is a great opportunity\r\nand a considerable danger. The opportunities are to help support the\r\nfamily, to learn self-reliance, to gain in efficiency, to appreciate\r\nthe sacrifices made by parents, to purchase innocent pleasures, and\r\nto save toward a college education. The dangers are that children\r\nmay become too commercially minded, grasping, even dishonest, make\r\ndull playmates, and become stunted in character for lack of play\r\nand wholesome stimulus to the imagination. If you will analyze these\r\ndangers you will find that they are all the results of overdoing good\r\nthings. The old rule of the Greeks, \"Nothing too much\" is the golden\r\nrule to measure perfect commercial relations between parents and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n2. But far more important than money making is character making.\r\nAnd therefore one of the principles of this book is to suggest in a\r\nthousand ways that money making may go too far. For example, I would\r\nencourage boys to gather and sell nuts, but not to take nuts from a\r\nneighbour's trees without permission nor destroy young trees whose\r\nfuture crops belong to a future generation of boys. I encourage\r\ntrapping but urge the use of humane traps to avoid cruelty. I encourage\r\nthe gathering and selling certain wild flowers, if abundant, but warn\r\nagainst the danger of exterminating species, or of robbing the public\r\nof pleasure. I have gone over all of the things that children do out of\r\ndoors and have tried to select the best occupations. I have studied the\r\nworst things they do and have suggested their opposites--constructive\r\nwork that earns money, develops character, or preserves public\r\nproperty. For example, instead of collecting birds' eggs I suggest\r\nmethods of attracting birds, building houses for them, and providing\r\nfood and protection from enemies.\r\n\r\n3. The book is addressed to the citizens of nineteen hundred and\r\ntwenty. Will not busy boys and girls make better citizens than idle\r\nones? Practical patriotism becomes second nature to children who learn\r\nearly to regard the rights of others, to respect the laws, and to\r\nprotect public property. The boy who raises wild fowl and liberates\r\nthem or refrains from mutilating for purely selfish ends a fine tree is\r\ndoing his share in the great work of conservation.\r\n\r\nBut the young workers cannot do it all. You will be disappointed if\r\nyou give this book to a child for a birthday or Christmas present\r\nand expect him to \"do the rest,\" without further help. There is no\r\nsubstitute for affectionate parental interest. This book will surely\r\nfail you if you do not thoroughly believe in the dignity of manual\r\nlabour and experience the uplift that rewards work with your own hands.\r\nAlthough in theory we may all believe in the dignity of labour (for\r\nother people), many of us make mental reservations to suit our own\r\ncases and persist in regarding certain forms of labour as distinctly\r\nbeneath our dignity. Children see through that attitude every time.\r\nWhen I used to be acquainted with the citizens of the George Junior\r\nRepublic, they had a saying that even the President and the Judge could\r\nnot maintain standing with the others unless they took their turn now\r\nand then working in the ditch. And so I say, work with your children,\r\nwith common tools, out in the dirt. The scratches will heal and the\r\ndirt will wash off, but the sense of kinship with workers will stay.\r\n\r\nHave a \"You and I\" club, with you and the children for members. Meet\r\nonce a week to discuss schemes for earning money to buy what the\r\nchildren want. It is easier to go out and earn the money and give it to\r\nthem to spend, but where do they come in? Read parts of this book aloud\r\nwhen outside information or suggestion is needed. Make a list of your\r\nchildren's occupations; consider whether they are the best ones. If you\r\nknow any better ones than I have put into this book please tell me, for\r\nI, too, have children and I wish them to have the very best works and\r\nplays that children in this world can have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.

There are several million\r\nAmerican boys and girls just like you. They want a lot of things, a\r\nlot of good things. Wouldn't you like a half dollar once a year for\r\na circus ticket, a quarter now and then for a box of candy, or ten\r\ndollars for a new dress or some music lessons? You'd be glad to buy\r\nyour own clothes, and select them too, if you had the cash. That would\r\nbe a big help in thousands of families. Parents sometimes wish that\r\ntheir children could \"leave out\" in new clothes in spring, like the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIf you could begin to earn money at twelve you could save toward a\r\ncollege education, too. Lots of boys and girls are earning their way.\r\nYou can. You can earn money between twelve and twenty years of age\r\nwithout interfering with your schooling.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of stories do you like best? Isn't it inspiring to read\r\nabout the boyhood of our great men. Do you remember young Abe Lincoln\r\nsplitting rails? Garfield drove mules on a tow path. The men and women\r\nwho are doing great things now started as boys and girls with work to\r\ndo. They washed dishes and split kindlings and fed chickens and milked\r\ncows and dug potatoes. Now they are tunnelling mountains, building\r\nbridges, helping make the world better in all sorts of courageous ways.\r\n\r\nDon't you like to hear engineers, miners, sailors, inventors, animal\r\ntrainers, cowboys, foresters, and other workers talk about their work?\r\nThe only really happy people are the ones who have found the work they\r\nlove best. I have put some stories in this book. These are told by real\r\nboys and girls who were successful in earning money. Can you beat them\r\nat their own game? Will you try?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of ways for young people in their teens to earn\r\nmoney. I believe the best are the outdoor ways. I have suggested a list\r\nof occupations, the best I can think of. Of course, no one person could\r\ntry them all. Circumstances must decide. You will succeed best with the\r\nwork which you like best. You must not let outside work interfere with\r\nyour studies. You must not undertake work that is too hard for your\r\nstrength or unsuited to your disposition. Maybe this list will help\r\nyou choose.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS SUITED TO THE FOUR SEASONS AND SOME THAT GO THROUGH THE YEAR\r\n\r\n_Summer._--Gathering berries, tree seeds, bulbs and roots, wild\r\nflowers and ferns, balsam leaves, medicinal plants, pine cones, making\r\ncollections, mowing lawns, marking tennis courts, sawing wood, cleaning\r\nrugs, drying herbs, corn and fruits, raising queen bees, collecting\r\nbait, rearing butterflies for museum specimens, gathering clam shells\r\nfor button factories, shocking grain, \"toting\" water.\r\n\r\n_Fall._--Gathering fruit, nuts, making corn husk mats and baskets,\r\nshelling corn, making leaf mould, clearing a field of stones, making\r\nstone fence, making grape juice and cider vinegar, collecting\r\nbayberries, painting barns and outbuildings, packing fruit, cleaning\r\nfarm implements, gathering faggots, collecting cocoons, collecting\r\ninsect homes for nature study.\r\n\r\n_Winter._--Gathering spruce gum, collecting Christmas greens,\r\nshovelling snow, pruning shrubs, vines and trees, trapping, tanning\r\nskins, making candles, selecting seed corn, pruning and tying\r\ngrapevines, transplanting trees and shrubs, feeding birds.\r\n\r\n_Spring._--Cutting seed potatoes, budding, grafting, cutting dandelions\r\nfrom lawns, killing weeds, oiling ponds and ditches to kill mosquitoes,\r\nshelling corn, starting silkworms, trout, frog and toad culture,\r\nattracting birds, fighting flies.\r\n\r\n_Year-Round Occupations._--Keeping bees, raising goldfish, training\r\nanimals, raising colts, sheep, pigs, goats, dogs, chickens and other\r\npoultry, rabbits and other pets, collecting wood for kindling, turning\r\ngrindstone, milking, taming wild creatures, raising prize corn,\r\npotatoes, or cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHINGS WORTH THINKING ABOUT\r\n\r\nDon't think only of the money you can earn. There's no use talking,\r\nthe work you do and the way you do it is going to have an influence on\r\nyour character. Do a good job! If you slight your work you cheat your\r\nemployer. You know it, if he doesn't. You cheat yourself, too. And when\r\nyou are working for yourself, you are the one who is doubly cheated by\r\nslack methods. That's plain.\r\n\r\nDon't choose an occupation you are doubtful about. Most occupations\r\nare perfectly honourable. Dishonesty comes in methods. The grown-up\r\ngrafters, ten to one, were cheaters at games, and sneaks about work.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, ask advice. Don't you like to be asked for your opinion?\r\nEverybody does. Ask your parents' advice about the work you think of\r\nundertaking, and the methods of carrying on the business side. What\r\nwill please them more than to know that you have a keen sense of honour?\r\n\r\nThis is my word of encouragement and inspiration to the boys and girls\r\nwho read this book. There are a hundred perfectly good reasons why you\r\nshould have more money of your own. And there are a thousand ways to\r\nearn it. Every one of you can earn a college education. Choose the best\r\nwork _for you_, and do it with enthusiasm. If you want my advice about\r\nyour work or any information I can get for you, nothing would please me\r\nmore than to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHARVESTING NATURE'S CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKING BERRIES\r\n\r\nThe berry picking season begins \"'long about knee-deep in June\" with\r\nthe first wild strawberries. It does not end till the last cranberry\r\nis harvested on the eve of Thanksgiving Day at the end of the drowsy\r\nIndian summer. There is money to be earned at this occupation wherever\r\nthere is ambition to overcome difficulties and force of character\r\nenough to step aside from the beaten paths. Fortunately berries are\r\nripe in vacation time. For some people berry picking has almost if\r\nnot quite the fascination of fishing. It lacks the objectionable\r\nfeatures of hunting, fishing and trapping. Guns, tackle, and traps are\r\nunnecessary in this gentler sport. No costly tools are required. A\r\nlight pail, flaring somewhat at the top, is a good receptacle. A wire\r\nbent into an S-shaped hook is handy to swing the pail over the forearm\r\nwhile the ambidextrous picker almost doubles the day's harvest if the\r\nfruit is extra plentiful.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a state in the Union which has not plenty of wild\r\nfruits. The young citizens of each state should know these fruits and\r\nmake the most of them. Some states or regions have fruits peculiar to\r\nthemselves. Wouldn't it be worth while for the domestic science or\r\ncookery teacher in a country school to show her pupils how to utilize\r\nthese home products? We hear talk about the cost of materials for use\r\nin classes in cookery. To let our wild fruits go to waste is poor\r\neconomy whichever way we look at it. Wouldn't you, if you live in\r\nnorthern Michigan, like to exchange a pot of thimbleberry jam for one\r\nmade in North Carolina from persimmons? Or if you live in Montana would\r\nyou exchange buffalo berry marmalade with a Florida friend for guava\r\njelly or preserved cumquats?\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RASPBERRIES\r\n\r\nJust the other day a girl from the shore of Lake Superior told me of a\r\ncamping trip on a part of the lake shore inaccessible except by water.\r\nA storm on the lake kept them from going home when they had expected so\r\nthey gathered raspberries and canned and jammed them till their sugar\r\ngave out, then until every available cooking utensil, even the coffee\r\npot, was full and the supply of berries was as unlimited as ever.\r\nThese great, luscious fruits, she said, were as big as the end of her\r\nthumb, and fairly falling off the bushes with the weight of juice.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it make your mouth water? The pickers who live near the woods\r\nup there bring berries to town in milk pails. The fruit box may be more\r\nelegant, but there is a bountiful sound about the milk pail that takes\r\nmy fancy. Of course, one gets scratched while berry-picking; but in\r\nwhat a good cause. Is there something wrong about boys and girls who\r\nprefer boxed berries and smooth hands to wild fruits and scratches?\r\nThere are thousands of dollars wasted every year that might be working\r\non some boy's or girl's schooling, just because nature's crop of\r\nraspberries isn't half harvested.\r\n\r\nWild raspberries should be canned, jellied, or jammed by the regulation\r\nmethods. With a good oil stove all the work can be done in the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIMBLEBERRY\r\n\r\nDo you know the thimbleberry? Some call it the flowering raspberry.\r\nYou will know by its shape and general look that it is a cousin to the\r\nblack raspberry although it is flatter, seedier, and more sharply acid.\r\nIt grows on a bush or shrub somewhat like a raspberry, but its leaves\r\nare broad, like grape leaves. Instead of thorns its twigs are clothed\r\nwith sticky hairs. The colour of the fruit is pinkish purple.\r\n\r\nThimbleberries grow often along woods margins, just back of the fringe\r\nof wild red raspberries. You are lucky if you get two cupfuls of the\r\nthimbleberries while your companion is picking two quarts of the\r\nraspberries. Yours pack more closely and the fruit is not so abundant.\r\n\r\nThe number of people who have tasted thimbleberry jam is small. I am\r\ntold by one who has made it that you can get any price you ask for tiny\r\nglasses of it, even a dollar a glass, from people who \"must have it.\"\r\nMade just as one does other jams, equal parts of fruit and sugar, there\r\nis nothing tastes quite like it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUEBERRIES\r\n\r\nBlueberry pie was a staple and justly popular dessert in a certain\r\ncollege dining-room, where I first made its acquaintance. It was, of\r\ncourse, made of canned blueberries, and we used to wonder where they\r\nall came from. We certainly never saw them growing in the Mississippi\r\nValley. The blueberry belt is a wide one and includes all the eastern\r\nand central states. I first saw them growing on Cape Ann, and later on\r\nthe New Hampshire hills. The women and children used to bring them in\r\nsmall pails to sell at the doors of their less enterprising neighbours.\r\nBut the price was always high and the berries not first class, unless\r\nwe gathered them ourselves. It takes a lot of picking to get two\r\nquarts. One gets an entirely wrong impression of the blueberry business\r\nfrom these experiences.\r\n\r\nThe great canning factories do not depend on a haphazard crop. In\r\nNew England and the eastern states there are thousands of acres of\r\nwaste land, shorn of its forest, where blueberries grow in greatest\r\nabundance. It is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the value\r\nof this wild crop. Pickers get from one and one-half to three cents a\r\nquart, and the boxes sell in retail market at from twelve and one-half\r\ncents to eighteen cents a box. Northern Michigan shipped five thousand\r\nbushels one year. They ship better than softer fruits, but the price\r\nis always high and the supply small because the canning factories are\r\nnear the fields, and shipping is expensive. One large factory uses\r\nseven hundred bushels a day. The total product of the Maine canneries\r\nten years ago was worth over one hundred thousand dollars. That must be\r\nwhere our college cook got her supply.\r\n\r\nHuckleberry and blueberry are the names used most commonly and you will\r\nmeet people who know one from the other. But as both are blue and there\r\nare high bush and low bush huckleberries, as well as high and low bush\r\nblueberries, it is useless to discuss the names. Both are right and a\r\nhuckleberry in Ohio may be a blueberry in Maine.\r\n\r\nA sort of rake to gather blueberries is used for the low bushes. But\r\nhand picking is best. The rake tears the bushes so, and the berries\r\nhave to be put through a fanning mill twice to free them from leaves\r\nand rubbish. This process fits them for the canners who are not as\r\nparticular as we wish they were.\r\n\r\nThe blueberry bush is a kind of Indian. It does not take kindly to\r\ngardens and other civilized places. It thrives and yields abundantly\r\nif given a chance on its native hillsides, and comes up by the million\r\nwherever the cutting of the timber lets in the light. By burning over\r\nthe blueberry land in very early spring while the ground is wet,\r\nthose in charge can keep down the alder, poplars, birches, and other\r\nnon-money-making growths, and this is taken by the blueberries as their\r\nchance. They come right up, and deliver a tremendous crop the first\r\nyear after the burning.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD GRAPES\r\n\r\nWe used to gather wild grapes along the river bottoms in the middle\r\nWest when we went nutting. Sometimes our nutting excursion turned out\r\nto be a grape harvest. These grapes were small, almost black under\r\ntheir thin coat of bloom, in clusters like miniature garden grapes. Oh,\r\nbut they were puckery when green, but the frost sweetened them. The\r\nvines grew tremendously, way to the tops of the trees, their stems like\r\ngreat ropes, which we used for swings. The grapes were really mostly\r\nseed and skin, but there was juice enough to stain our aprons, and give\r\nthe teeth and tongue an unmistakable telltale hue. There was juice\r\nenough for a kind of jelly which I believe had the peculiarity of never\r\n\"jelling\" properly. It is good, though, and they were well worth the\r\nsugar to make them edible.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at their size when I first saw the big summer grapes\r\nof the eastern hedge-rows and banks. But their flavour is no great\r\nimprovement over that of the frost grape. There is more pulp, though.\r\nMy barberry gathering friend, who admits that she is \"fond of all sorts\r\nof woodland flavours,\" gathers these grapes in August before they\r\nbegin to change colour. She makes the only really green grape jelly I\r\nhave seen. This is her receipt:\r\n\r\nWash the stemmed grapes very carefully to rid them of dust and possible\r\ntaint from poison ivy, with which they often associate. Put them into a\r\npreserving kettle with a very little boiling water, cover and let them\r\nsteam till tender. (No boiling here.) Strain to get rid of seeds and\r\nskins. (Work fast at this point, because delay may cause the change of\r\ncolour we wish to avoid.) Weigh the juice and an equal amount of white\r\nsugar. Heat sugar and juice separately, without scorching. Stir the hot\r\nsugar into the boiling juice, let boil up, skim, and put into dry, hot\r\nglasses. If it boils a long time it loses the green colour, and its\r\nflavour of the wild out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nGreen grape jelly that is really green is a triumph. It would bring a\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDERBERRIES\r\n\r\nElderberries have almost gone out of fashion in these days of\r\nrefrigerator cars and cold storage, when fruits from all parts of the\r\nworld are brought to our doors. But I am antiquated enough to like the\r\nrather flat, seedy things, and the \"runny\" jelly is of a wonderful\r\ncolour and flavour. Best of all is the fun of gathering the broad,\r\nflat clusters, always seeing a finer one just a few steps farther on\r\nor just over the fence. The golden-rod is brilliant in the September\r\nsunshine, the asters like star stuff sifted in every fence corner,\r\nwhile the fox grapes clambering over stray trees along the line fence\r\nfill the air with fragrance. Perhaps I could get on without the\r\nelderberries, but the New England conscience requires some practical\r\nexcuse for traipsing off over the fields when there is useful work to\r\nbe done indoors. Elderberries canned in a thin syrup, one cup of water,\r\ntwo of sugar, and all the berries the jar will hold, are excellent for\r\nsteamed pudding. Drain off the juice, and stir the berries into the\r\nbatter just as you would blueberries, mulberries, or any other fruit.\r\nThe colour of the pudding will be awe-inspiring but with the juice for\r\nsauce it is good, really.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRIES\r\n\r\nOur Westchester County hostess always took a basket on her arm when\r\nshe went for a walk. She had an unusual taste for wild flavours of all\r\nsorts and her guests were always sure of some delightful surprise at\r\nher table. In September there is a choice of wild fruits, and everybody\r\nrecognized the necessity for a basket. I wondered, though, when we\r\npassed, unnoticed, bushels of elderberries, and rods of browning\r\ngrapes, and headed for a group of dogwood trees. But although the\r\nberries were thicker than I ever saw on the dogwood, they were only\r\nadmired and left for the sun to burnish. High on a bare hilltop we sat\r\nwhere the view was panoramic. The lady with the basket betook herself\r\nto a fringe of tall, ruddy bushes on the brow of the hill, and I found\r\nher busily filling her basket with barberries. She did not wait to pick\r\nthem singly but snipped off the laden twigs with scissors, avoiding\r\nthus the angry thorns.\r\n\r\n\"What are they good for?\" I asked, as I tasted again the sharp,\r\nastringent flavour and felt that indescribable pucker on tongue and\r\nlips that goes with it. The barberry had long been a favourite with me;\r\nthe bush for its wayward grace and its cunning flowers, the berries for\r\ntheir exquisite bloom and for tasting so unlike any cultivated thing.\r\nBut I had never dreamed of making jelly of them.\r\n\r\n\"Jelly,\" said our hostess. \"It's particularly good with game.\"\r\n\r\nOf course it would be good with game, but can you imagine eating\r\nbarberry jelly with corn-fed pork or with fat mutton?\r\n\r\nThe berries should be gathered before they are fully ripe and treated\r\nlike currants, although the yield of juice is meagre. Add a little\r\nwater and heat slowly. Strain and add \"pound for pound\" of sugar. Put\r\nin tiny glasses. Any one in search for a unique Christmas gift for an\r\nepicurean uncle would find barberry jelly fills the bill.\r\n\r\nIn Salem, Mass., I saw barberries for sale in the market. They looked\r\nmightily out of place along with pineapples, watermelons, grapes,\r\npeaches, Japanese plums, and other conventional market fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAYBERRIES\r\n\r\nTwo friends of mine, summering on Cape Ann, discovered there to their\r\ndelight, a low shrub, growing in great profusion on the rocky hills.\r\nThe foliage was of a rich green colour, of a leathery texture, and was\r\npossessed of an aromatic odour at once delightful and wholesome to\r\ntheir senses. They were seized with a great desire to take home with\r\nthem a quantity of this plentiful foliage to make into pillows or to\r\nfeed the fire on the hearth that they might inhale its fragrance, and\r\nbe reminded of Cape Ann and the summer sea.\r\n\r\nSo they procured huge gunny sacks which they were at some pains to\r\nstuff to their utmost capacity. They have a snapshot of themselves,\r\nbent double under the weight of the great sacks. With the help of\r\na friendly native they succeeded in transporting the burdens to the\r\nexpress office, and addressed them home. We cheerfully paid the\r\nexpressman's charges at the home end, having been advised that the bags\r\nwere coming, and carried them to the attic floor where they were to be\r\nspread to cure. But when the contents came tumbling out, its pent-up\r\nfragrance was familiar. Then was it possible those blessed geese had\r\nbeen spending their precious vacation days gathering bay berry leaves?\r\nIt was even so, and we had paid nearly two dollars express on the\r\nbags--and our woods were full of it! What a laugh we had at their\r\nexpense when they came to reimburse us.\r\n\r\nThe bayberry shrub is also called wax myrtle and it is easy to see why,\r\nwhen you find the berries in October. They are gray, almost white, and\r\nyou see that each one is covered with tiny drops of wax that has oozed\r\nout of the berry and dried on its surface.\r\n\r\nBayberry is called candleberry, too, because of the use our\r\ngreat-grandmothers made of the wax. Bayberry dips have come into\r\nfashion again and people who make them skilfully find a ready sale for\r\ntheir product.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING BAYBERRY DIPS\r\n\r\nTo make bayberry candles you must first gather the wax-covered berries.\r\nGet them early, for, as cold weather comes on, the pellets of wax drop\r\noff. Two quarts make only a little ball of wax, so you must gather an\r\nenormous quantity of the berries. Put them into water and bring it to\r\na boil, stirring well to be sure that all the wax is melting. Being\r\nlighter than water the wax will rise to the surface. When you think\r\nall the berries are bare, take them from the fire. As the water cools,\r\nthe wax hardens on top. If the berries do not all go to the bottom you\r\nwill have to melt the wax again over a slow fire or in a double boiler\r\nuntil the wax rises clean at the top; all dirt and refuse on its lower\r\nsurface can be scraped off. Do not let the wax burn. Smoke is a sure\r\nsign that it is too hot. In a double boiler there is no danger.\r\n\r\nTo make the dips, take regular candle wicking, a soft, white, loosely\r\ntwisted cord, cut it twice the desired length for the candle. Double it\r\nand twist enough to hold it together. The loop at one end is convenient\r\nto hold it by. Dip into the hot wax and then as it cools draw the wick\r\ndown with finger and thumb so that it hangs straight and kinkless.\r\nA second dip adds a little to the diameter of the candle, the third\r\nanother layer and so on till your first bayberry dip is finished. If\r\nthe first effort is not a good shape and has to go back into the pot\r\nyou needn't be discouraged. Didn't the first chocolate cream you ever\r\nmade look like a chestnut gone wrong? But with patience it is possible\r\nfor even a beginner to produce very shapely candles. They do not need\r\nto be absolutely regular. Paraffin or tallow candles, moulded just\r\nalike by the hundred thousand dozen, may be as round and perfect as\r\nmachinery can make them. Part of the charm of the bayberry dips is in\r\nthese slight irregularities of shape and size.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD CRAB APPLES\r\n\r\nThickets of small trees, bearing little solid green apples are a\r\nfeature of almost every farm in the prairie states. They are common\r\nalso on the hilly pastures of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and New\r\nYork. The South, too, has its native crab apple. School children the\r\ncountry over loved in my day to fill their pockets with the hard, sour,\r\nlittle fruits and nibble at them surreptitiously under cover of a broad\r\ngeography. But perhaps children's tastes have changed since that far\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nModern geography must be different, anyhow. I saw one the other day\r\nshaped just like a fifth reader or history or any other. It just looked\r\nlike any book, not one bit like a g'ography.\r\n\r\nThe little crabs were made into sauce or \"butter,\" by pioneers of the\r\nprairie states. We washed, quartered, and cut out the wormy places,\r\nstewed them till soft with a little water, then put them through a\r\ncoarse sieve to take out seeds, cores, and skin. The pulp was then\r\nsweetened with sorghum molasses and boiled; stirring is necessary to\r\nprevent burning. The appetites of those days did not demand dainty\r\nfare. Well do I remember a small visitor to whom our cookery was new\r\nwhose demand for crab-apple-sauce-if-you-please was hard to satisfy. I\r\nbelieve crab apple jelly would be regarded a great delicacy by people\r\nof good taste, if once they had a try at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIMMONS\r\n\r\nThe children of the persimmon belt, which includes a much larger part\r\nof the eastern half of the United States than many suppose, all know\r\nthat the fruit of some trees is better than that of others. The 'possum\r\nknows, too, and lucky is he who finds both \"fruits\" on the same tree.\r\nThere is a market for persimmons if they are gathered after frost,\r\nand a greater demand may be created. Seeing an unfamiliar fruit in\r\nthe market is very likely to awaken the interest. Whether the buyer\r\nwill want a second basket or not depends entirely upon the cleverness\r\nof the person that supplies the demand. The thoroughly ripe fruit is,\r\naccording to an experienced traveller, \"entirely without bitterness\r\nor astringency, sweet, rich, and juicy.\" What more can you say about\r\nwatermelon or strawberries? But if you who gather the fruits persist\r\nin hurrying them green into market you may expect that the prejudice\r\nagainst persimmons will grow stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWS\r\n\r\nIs there any good reason why some of the people who used to be boys\r\nshould never have a chance to taste any thorn apples now that they are\r\nolder? Perhaps these grown-up boys deserve to be punished for deserting\r\nthe old haunts, but give them a taste of what the open road has to\r\noffer and maybe they will be tempted back to a simpler life.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the May haw or apple haw of the far South is sold in\r\nthe markets of some cities and is made into preserves and jelly. The\r\nWashington thorn which grows wild in Virginia and the other states not\r\nfar from the capital city is also cultivated in many gardens farther\r\nnorth. It has run wild from these gardens and ranges over New York,\r\nPennsylvania and neighbouring states. Though usually small, its berries\r\nare a beautifully shining scarlet and very numerous. It is worth\r\nrisking a pound or so of sugar just to see what jelly they would make.\r\nThe pear haw has a thick, juicy flesh, and some of the yellow ones are\r\nequally good.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD PLUMS\r\n\r\nThe wild plums of the East did not strike the early settlers as very\r\nmuch worth while. They were almost all seed and skin and the rest\r\nwas \"pucker.\" Quite naturally the plums of the mother country were\r\npreferred and sprouts were brought over and set in the gardens of our\r\nforefathers. These plum emigrants did so well in the new country that\r\nthey escaped from the gardens into the pastures and roadsides, coming\r\nup wherever seeds were dropped. In such places they still flourish\r\nand are thought of as wild plums. They are gathered for market, but\r\ncompare unfavourably, except with very old-fashioned people, with the\r\ngarden-grown fruits of the same or similar varieties.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers of the middle West, however, found very fine plums\r\ngrowing wild in plentiful thickets. We used to gather these native\r\nplums in the Mississippi Valley, in great tubfuls. We not only\r\nappreciated the crop nature provided for us every year, but were\r\nfar-sighted enough to realize that the time would come when the march\r\nof civilization would tramp out the plum thickets. So we planted them\r\nin orchards and gardens, taking those trees that had given us the best\r\ncrops of the biggest, finest fruit. In fact, the pioneers did just what\r\nwe ought to be doing all over our country with other wild fruits and\r\nwith nuts. The wild goose plum is a native which has founded a race of\r\nwhich there are many named varieties, much bigger and finer than the\r\nlittle, old, wild grandmother of the plum thicket, but they all have\r\nstill that same tart tang, just under the skin, that gave to our wild\r\nplum \"jell\" its incomparable flavour.\r\n\r\nAre the wild plums all forgotten? Must all fruit come out of boxes and\r\nhave that stale taste of the town? Must it lose its characteristic\r\naroma and give off only that general \"markety\" smell? Is \"goin'\r\nplummin'\" entirely out of fashion, even in the prairie states? I don't\r\nbelieve it is as bad as that. Do you believe that moving pictures or\r\nshoot the shoots or merry-go-rounds can begin to compare with such\r\nsimple pleasures as plumming, graping, berrying, and nutting? I have\r\ntried both, and give me the old, homely pleasures every time.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from \"The Tree Book\" so well describes an annual\r\nouting of pioneer children that it is quoted in full:\r\n\r\n\"'Do you calculate to go a-plummin' this fall?' The question was\r\nquietly put in father's judicial tones, but it sent an electric thrill\r\nfrom head to toes of every youngster. Mother's reply sent an answering\r\ncurrent, and the enthusiasm of the moment burst all bounds. 'Well, you\r\nbetter go this afternoon. I can spare the team and wagon, and I guess\r\nJohn is big enough to drive. There's no use goin' at all if you don't\r\ngo right off.'\r\n\r\n\"So mother and the children rode out of the yard, she sitting with her\r\nyoung driver on the spring seat, the rest on boards laid across the\r\nwagon box behind. What a jouncing they got when the wheels struck a\r\nstone in a rut! But who cared for a trifle like that? John's reckless\r\ndriving but brought nearer the goal of their heart's desire.\r\n\r\n\"A lurid colour lightened the plum thicket as it came in sight. The\r\nyellow leaves were falling and the fruit glowed on the bending twigs.\r\nClose up the wagon is drawn; then all hands pile out, and the fun\r\nreally begins. How large and sweet they are this year! Mother knows how\r\nto avoid the puckery, thick skin in eating plums. The youngsters try\r\nto chew two or three at once and their faces are drawn into knots. But\r\nthey soon get used to that.\r\n\r\n\"Now the small folks with pails are sent to pick up ripe plums under\r\nthe trees, and warned against eating too many. 'Remember last year,'\r\nsays mother, and they do remember. The larger boys spread strips of\r\nburlap and rag carpet under the fullest trees, in turn, and give their\r\nbranches a good beating that showers the plums down. With difficulty\r\nthe boys and girls make their way into the thicket; but torn jackets\r\nand aprons and scratched hands can be mended--such accidents are\r\noverlooked in the excitement of filling the grain sacks with ripe\r\nfruit. How fine 'plum butter' will taste on the bread and butter of the\r\nnoon lunch when winter comes and school begins. (The Pennsylvanian's\r\nlove for 'spreads' on his bread leavened the West completely.)\r\n\r\n\"Other neighbours have come, and started in with a vim. It seems\r\nunreasonable to take any more. The bags are full, and there are some\r\npoured loose into the wagon box. Besides, everybody is tired, and John\r\nshouts that the hazel-nuts are ripe on the other side of the log road.\r\n\r\n\"A great grape vine, loaded with purple clusters, claims mother's\r\nattention. There will probably be no better chance for grapes this\r\nfall, and the sun is still an hour high. John chops down the little\r\ntree that supports it and the girls eagerly help to fill the pails with\r\nthe fruit of the prostrate vine, while John goes back to command the\r\nhazel-nut brigade and sees that no eager youngster strays too far.\r\n\r\n\"Mother's voice gives the final summons, and the children gather at the\r\nwagon, tired but regretful for the filled husks that they must leave\r\nbehind on the hazel bushes. A loaded branch of the grape vine is cut\r\noff bodily, and lifted into the wagon. The team is hitched on, and the\r\nhappy passengers in the wagon turn their faces homeward.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the poetry of pioneer life. Pleasures were simple, primitive,\r\nhearty--like the work--closely interlinked with the fight against\r\nstarvation. There was nothing dull or uninteresting about either. The\r\nplums and grapes were sweetened with molasses made from sorghum cane.\r\nEach farmer grew a little strip, and one of them had a mill to which\r\nevery one hauled his cane to be ground \"on the shares.\"\r\n\r\nWho will say that this \"long sweetenin'\" was poor stuff, that the\r\nquality of the spiced grapes suffered for lack of sugar, or that any\r\nmodern preserves have a more excellent flavour than those of the old\r\ndays made out of the wild plums gathered in the woods? And this is also\r\ntrue: There is no more exhilarating holiday conceivable than those half\r\ndays when mother took the children and \"went a-plummin'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS\r\n\r\nThe wild nuts gathered in this country for sale or home use in the\r\nNorth are chestnuts, hickory nuts, black walnuts, butternut, hazel-nut,\r\nbeechnut; in the South, the pecan and the chinquapin; in the far West,\r\nthe pine nut. The least known of these in eastern markets are the\r\npine nuts, which form a very staple article of food for many tribes\r\nof Indians in the Great Basin. John Muir says that there are tens of\r\nthousands of acres covered with nut pines. An industrious Indian family\r\ncan gather fifty or sixty bushels in a month if the snow does not catch\r\nthem. The little cones are beaten off with poles as the trees are not\r\nhigh, and are heated till they open and the nuts fall out from under\r\nthe scales. I have eaten pine nuts in Turkish restaurants. They came\r\nas a surprise in a dish of eggplant stuffed with chopped meat, raisins,\r\nnuts, bread crumbs, and I know not what all else.\r\n\r\nThe native chestnut, though smaller, is far sweeter than the popular\r\nSpanish one. But it looks as if some foreigner must take the place\r\nof our native chestnuts in the woods as well as in the market. The\r\nchestnut disease which has driven the trees out of the parks and wood\r\nlots near New York City is baffling the scientists. Every year the\r\ndeadline moves westward and southward and northward from its center.\r\nPerhaps a cure will be found before all the chestnuts are gone. If any\r\nregion has a few trees which seem to withstand the disease while all\r\nthe rest die, those trees should be preserved and used to propagate a\r\nrace of chestnuts which would be immune. It may be that the Spanish\r\nand Japanese chestnuts will prove hardier than our own. These are\r\nbeing grown quite extensively in some Eastern states. They bear when\r\nremarkably young. Japanese chestnuts begin to bear, according to the\r\nnurserymen, \"at three years of age, bear from three to seven nuts in\r\na bur, each nut measuring from four to five inches in circumference.\"\r\nTrees five years old bear two or three quarts each and the yield\r\nincreases rapidly from year to year. These bring fancy prices in city\r\nmarkets and are eaten either raw or cooked.\r\n\r\nIn growing chestnuts it is the practice first to cut down the old\r\nnative trees. As in all likelihood these would be dead in a few years\r\nanyhow, this is economical. Dead lumber is not as valuable as live\r\nlumber. The first year after a chestnut is cut, a crop of young suckers\r\ncome up around the stump. These shoots are grafted with scions of a\r\ndesired variety. There is a good story of a lad of twelve years of\r\nage who asked his father to graft a chestnut tree. Although the man\r\nwas grafting apple trees at the time he laughed at the boy's idea.\r\nThe lad did not forget and years after he put his idea into practice\r\nand now owns a chestnut grove which brings him an income of thousands\r\nof dollars. His chestnut groves are on waste land unfit for ordinary\r\nfarm purposes. If one farm boy in every county would take an interest\r\nin growing the nuts that belong to his region, think how the value of\r\nthe nut crop would increase. Every boy knows that the hickory nuts on\r\none particular shell-bark are bigger and sweeter than on every other\r\none he knows of. He and his friends try to get there first, before the\r\n\"other gang\" do, and make sure of their share. But does he ever plant\r\nany big sweet nuts along a fence row and take care of the young trees\r\ntill they are big enough to take care of themselves? In the seventeenth\r\ncentury there was a law in certain European countries that every young\r\nman should plant a certain number of walnut trees. Unless he could\r\nprove that he had complied with the law, he couldn't marry. What a good\r\nidea! With such a law we might have more fine trees and fewer hasty\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINQUAPINS\r\n\r\nA coloured girl brought me a pint of chinquapins from her home in\r\nCa'line County, Virginia; I sampled them eagerly, taking great pleasure\r\nin their diminutive prettiness, tidy shape, and rich, dark colouring.\r\nI kept a handful securely tied in the little salt bag in which they\r\nhad made the journey and took them to my native state to show to the\r\nchildren, who had never seen a chestnut tree of any kind.\r\n\r\nWhen I took the bag from the trunk, there was a dustiness about the\r\nfeel of it that aroused my suspicions. I emptied the contents into a\r\nflat dish. There were my nuts, their glossy brown shells as smooth as\r\never, but empty. Rolling about amongst them were a lot of the plumpest\r\nlittle white grubs, fairly bent double with corpulency. There must have\r\nbeen one for each nut, for not a sound kernel was left.\r\n\r\nI learn from chestnut-wise people that these weevils are another great\r\nenemy of chestnut culture, no remedy having been found.\r\n\r\nThe chinquapin is the Southern child's chestnut. It is sometimes a\r\ntree, but more often a low shrub. The bur is round and has only one nut\r\nin it. A good many are marketed, especially in Southern cities, and\r\nbring a good price when fresh. The weevils enter the nuts before they\r\nare mature and it is difficult to find the bad nuts till too late to\r\nprevent a disagreeable impression. This interferes with the popularity\r\nof the chinquapin as a dessert nut.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZEL-NUTS\r\n\r\nThe American hazel-nut flourishes over the eastern half of the United\r\nStates. It is a sweet little nut, much more to my taste than the\r\nbigger filbert, which is so popular in our markets. We used to gather\r\nhazel-nuts in the edge of woods which fringe the little rivers of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. The bushes grew in thickets and while the\r\nbig brothers and sisters gathered the nuts from among the closely\r\ninterlaced branches that grew scarcely higher than their heads, the\r\nsmaller fry crept in underneath and getting about on the floor of the\r\nwoods searched for nuts that had ripened early and dropped from the\r\nbrowning husk.\r\n\r\nThere is no progress in simply going out in the fall and taking what\r\nnature furnishes. Unaided, the good mother goes on producing the same\r\nsmall nuts, caring just as patiently for the inferior ones and even\r\nencouraging the nut weevils to prey upon them. But I wonder if some boy\r\nor girl who thinks there isn't any interesting work to be done on the\r\nfarm, could not make some experiments in hazel-nut culture.\r\n\r\nThe bushes grow readily from seed, but seedlings do not always produce\r\nas fine nuts as those that were planted. For this reason one can\r\nsave time by selecting the bushes that bear the largest crop of fine\r\nnuts and propagating those. They grow in any well drained, fairly\r\nrich soil and I know of hundreds of miles of fence rows answering\r\nthese requirements, which now produce poison ivy, cat brier and other\r\nharmful crops. Hazel bushes make a beautiful fence row, and yield a\r\nsalable crop. Hazel bushes propagate naturally by suckers and layers.\r\nBy manuring well in summer long shoots for layering will be forced.\r\n\"These should be staked down in winter or spring and covered with\r\nearth. They may be removed to nursery rows or orchard at the end of\r\nthe first season.\" So says W. A. Taylor in the \"Cyclopædia of American\r\nHorticulture.\" The same writer gives directions for pruning as follows:\r\nStrong shoots should be headed back to promote spur formation (the\r\nnuts are borne on short side shoots) and old wood that has borne fruit\r\nshould be removed annually. Suckers should be kept down unless wanted\r\nfor propagation. March or April is the best time to prune as they\r\nblossom very early and one must avoid cutting off either the young nuts\r\nor the pollen-bearing flowers. The nuts should be gathered when the\r\nhusk begins to brown at the edges. If left longer, as is most often\r\ndone, in the case of wild nuts, a large proportion of the crop falls\r\nto the ground and is lost. Beside, the dried hulled nuts do not bring\r\nas high a price as the fresh unhusked ones. If kept long in the husk\r\nthey will mould, unless dried thoroughly. The nuts, however, will keep\r\nthrough the season in a cool place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUTS\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the black walnut is enclosed in a globe-shaped husk. All\r\ncountry boys and girls know how that husk smells and how it stains the\r\nfingers. The nuts are very oily and must be treated carefully. They\r\nshould be dried, preferably on the garret floor, hulled and stored in a\r\ncool, dry place. If for market, they should be sold immediately. They\r\nare very likely to grow rancid if kept. Billy, in the \"Limberlost\"\r\nstory, had a piece of heavy plank with a hole in it, just big enough to\r\nlet the husked nut through. He put an unhulled nut over the hole, then\r\nwith a wooden mallet, he drove it through the hole. It came through\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nThe butternut or oilnut is from a tree closely related to the black\r\nwalnut. It is called also white walnut. The husk is not so thick as\r\nthat of the black walnut and adheres stubbornly to the nut if left to\r\ndry. The nuts get rancid if kept warm and should be marketed as soon as\r\ndry or kept stored in the cold and eaten before spring.\r\n\r\nPickled walnuts are a highly prized delicacy in households where\r\n\"culturine\" has not taken the place of old-fashioned household arts.\r\nThe nuts are gathered when green, before the shell has hardened. If a\r\nknitting needle can be pushed clear through the nut, it is not too old\r\nfor pickling. You will be fortunate if you can get a receipt from some\r\nhousewife who has time for real culture as well as for making pickles.\r\n\r\n_Receipt for Pickled Walnuts._--(From my great aunt's cook-book.)\r\nIngredients: One hundred walnuts, salt and water, one gallon of\r\nvinegar, two ounces of whole black pepper, half an ounce of cloves, one\r\nounce of allspice, one ounce of root ginger sliced, one ounce of mace.\r\n\r\nGather the nuts in July when they are full grown. They should be soft\r\nenough to be pierced all through with a needle. Prick them all well\r\nthrough. Let them remain nine days in brine (four pounds of salt to\r\neach gallon of water), changing the brine every third day. Drain them,\r\nand let them remain in the sun two or three days until they become\r\nblack. Put them into jars, not quite filling them. Boil the vinegar and\r\nspices together ten minutes, and pour the liquid over the walnuts. They\r\nwill be fit for use in a month, and will keep for years.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEECHNUTS\r\n\r\nThe boys of your neighbourhood may not know that the smooth,\r\ngray-barked trees with very long, slender, pointed buds are beeches.\r\nThey may never have noticed the wonderful gray-green colour nor\r\ndelicate texture of the newly opened leaves, nor the soft, silky\r\nflower head that bears the pollen. Too many boys think these\r\npreliminaries are of no importance. The chances are strong that when\r\nOctober ripens the nuts, nobody has any difficulty in locating beech\r\ntrees, if there are any in the vicinity. Usually, in the wild woods,\r\nthey grow in large groups of various sizes; the big trees sheltering\r\nthe little ones until they are strong enough to live in the full\r\nsunlight. Do boys and girls find the beeches by instinct just as the\r\nmice, the blue jays, the squirrels, and the foraging hogs do?\r\n\r\nDo you know why it takes so much longer to gather a pint of beechnuts\r\nthan the same amount of hazel-nuts? They are pretty small; yes, but\r\nthere's another reason. If you were to count your beechnuts, you would\r\nfind it takes many more of them by count to make a pint than of the\r\nround nuts, because of their triangular shape. They fit so snugly that\r\nyour pint measure of beechnuts is almost solid nuts. They are about the\r\nsweetest of the wild nuts. They are very rich in fat too, and in olden\r\ntimes an oil for table use was made from beechnuts. Olive oil takes\r\nits place now and costs less. There is a market for all the beechnuts\r\nyou can gather. Dealers in tree seeds often have difficulty in filling\r\norders. As the nuts do not germinate till April they may be gathered\r\nat any time during the winter, unless the wild folks have gathered them\r\nall. The chances are that to get any you would have to go early and\r\nsearch sharply. Once or so in a lifetime the burrow of a white-footed\r\nmouse is discovered near beech woods. Are you hard hearted enough not\r\nonly to break and enter, but also to burgle his hoard? Rather admire\r\nthe little creature's industry and resolve to go and do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORY NUTS\r\n\r\nAmerica is the only country that has native hickory nuts. Of these the\r\nbest nut producers are the shagbarks and the pecans. These two nuts are\r\nincreasingly popular. People are planting these nuts and experimenting\r\nwith new varieties, with grafting and cultivation, as never before.\r\nPecan orchards are being planted in many regions and hickory nuts are\r\nbeing studied with a view to improving the kernel and reducing the\r\nhardness of the shell. The value of hickory wood in the making of tools\r\nand for fuel has made the lumber more profitable than the nuts. But\r\nwith improved varieties this may not be true. The poor quality of the\r\nwood of the pecan has saved these native trees from destruction.\r\n\r\nHickory nuts have a husk as every country child knows; but the husk has\r\na good-natured habit of splitting neatly into four equal parts which\r\nfall away from the nut when dry. There are several kinds of hickory\r\nwhich produce sweet, edible nuts, but the nuts of the true shagbark are\r\nthe best. They grow on low hills near streams or swamps in good soil\r\nin the Eastern and Middle states as far south as Florida, and as far\r\nwest as Kansas. The king nuts of the Mississippi are bigger, but not so\r\ngood, although the price you get for them is good and the baskets fill\r\nfaster than with the little shagbarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECANS\r\n\r\nThis nut tree grows in the South, and as the wood is too brittle to be\r\nvery valuable nobody has cut it for lumber. Tremendous interest has\r\nbeen aroused during the past ten years in pecan growing. Pecan orchards\r\nare being planted in all sorts of soil, good, bad, and indifferent. The\r\nwisest planters have gone to nature to learn what kind of conditions\r\nthe pecan requires. By cultivation and fertilizing and otherwise\r\nimproving good natural conditions, many growers are succeeding. By\r\nplanting nuts from trees that produce fine ones abundantly every year,\r\nand by budding these trees with scions from still finer specimen trees\r\ngreat improvement has been made. I have a picture of a pecan tree in\r\nGeorgia, sixteen years old, which is nearly fifty feet high. It has\r\nborne already three hundred and fifty pounds of nuts and this year's\r\ncrop will be over a hundred pounds. This tree has never had to fight\r\nweeds, has always had plenty to eat and drink, was protected in winter\r\nwhile young, and now it is ready to foot all its own bills and give a\r\nfine profit. How many of us are ready to do that at sixteen years? The\r\ncultivation of pecans is only just begun. Very little of the annual\r\ncrop of these nuts is harvested in orchards. In \"The Tree Book\" the\r\nauthor says that ninety-five per cent. of the crop is still gathered\r\nin the woods. The annual crop is tremendous, and the pickers get only\r\nthree to ten cents a pound for the ungraded nuts. For the very best\r\nnuts, mainly sold for seed, the retail price is from fifty cents to a\r\ndollar a pound, which is from one to two cents per nut.\r\n\r\nWho picks all these nuts in the woods? Surely, the boys and girls of\r\nthe pecan belt do their share. Do they do it in a primitive way or are\r\ntheir methods worthy of the up-to-date American youngster? Professor\r\nHume of the Florida Agriculture Experiment Station (Bulletin No. 85,\r\n1906) gives suggestions for gathering the pecan crop in the orchard\r\nwhich ought to be useful to the \"wild picker.\" The nuts ought to be\r\ngathered as soon as the most of the burs have opened. In orchards, the\r\npickers use ladders for young trees and climb the big ones and gather\r\nthe nuts by hand into sacks. Beating and shaking the trees is only\r\nresorted to for the nuts that are entirely out of reach. If allowed\r\nto fall on the ground so many of the nuts are lost that the profits\r\nare materially lessened. If practicable a large sheet should be placed\r\nunder the tree to save this loss.\r\n\r\nThe nuts should be spread under some sort of roof to cure, which\r\nrequires ten days or two weeks.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried the experiment of sorting and grading the nuts you\r\ngather? The fruits of wild trees vary greatly in their size and general\r\nappearance. The wholesale dealer who buys nuts undoubtedly grades them\r\nand gets a fancy price for the big ones. Why should you not benefit by\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nPecans are graded by sifting them through screens, the mesh of which\r\nlets only those of small size through. You might build up a private\r\ntrade in wild nuts by packing your best nuts in attractive pasteboard\r\nboxes and charging a good retail rate for them. The inferior nuts you\r\ncould well afford to sell at the lowest wholesale price as your average\r\nwould be higher than the wholesaler would pay for unsorted nuts.\r\n\r\nYour fancy nuts would have to be polished in order to compete with the\r\nnuts sold in city markets. The polishing does not make the meat any\r\nsweeter, but it does make a more attractive dessert nut, especially now\r\nthat folks are used to seeing them polished. This is done by putting\r\nsome dry sand into a barrel with the nuts and rolling the barrel about\r\ntill the nuts are polished. If you have a worn out barrel or box churn,\r\nas we once had, that would be just the thing. Fancy packages of five to\r\nten pounds would be very much in demand at Christmas. The big cities\r\nare well supplied with this sort of thing, but in the smaller cities\r\nand larger towns there are always some people who know a good thing\r\nwhen they see it and to whom the local markets often fail to supply\r\nthese little luxuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUT GROWING\r\n\r\nIn Bulletin No. 125 of the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station\r\npublished in 1908 you may read: \"The young and middle-aged should not\r\nonly plant nut trees themselves, but should encourage the children to\r\ndo likewise. Every farm boy ought to have a small nut nursery and be\r\ntaught to plant and care for nut trees. Nothing more creditable could\r\nbe done in the schools than to interest the boys and girls in the\r\npossibilities of nut production and to celebrate Arbor Day with the\r\nplanting of nut trees.\"\r\n\r\nDoesn't that read like sound advice? Think of the land on your father's\r\nfarm to-day that is not working. Or if there isn't any idle land\r\ncan you not persuade him to lend you an acre or so for experimental\r\npurposes? The chances are that he will encourage and help you because\r\nhe wants you to be interested in the farm. But you may say to yourself:\r\n\"Not much! I don't mean to stay on the farm. I'm going to work hard and\r\nget an education. I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or a banker.\"\r\nNevertheless, you take the Maryland man's advice and set out some nut\r\ntrees. Let us say you start your nut orchard at age fourteen when you\r\nhave three years yet in the high school. Your trees will be set so far\r\napart that some other crops will be grown between them; corn, potatoes,\r\nmelons, or anything that requires good cultivation and fertilization.\r\nWhen you finish the high school your nut trees will not look very big,\r\nbut promising. You go on to college and in four years you will see a\r\nbig change. No crop is in sight yet but you are only twenty-one and\r\nready to go to work. You may forget all about those nut trees for a few\r\nyears but they are not forgetting their business. They will bear a few\r\nnuts some year, as if to try their hand at a new enterprise. Some day\r\nwhen you are needing a sum of money to start in business for yourself,\r\nand you are wondering who will lend you that much, you will get word\r\nfrom the folks at home that they have harvested your first crop of\r\npecans or English walnuts or Spanish chestnuts and have deposited a\r\nthousand dollars in the bank in your name as the net profits. Will you\r\ntry it?\r\n\r\nBefore planting nut trees it is important to learn all you can by\r\nreading and by correspondence with your Experiment Station experts\r\nabout the kinds that will do best in your region and on your soil. If\r\nmore boys used a little forethought we should have fewer young college\r\nmen struggling along on small salaries in work they dislike, just for\r\nlack of a tidy sum of ready money to set them on their feet at the\r\ncritical time.\r\n\r\nThere are good reasons for this greater interest in nut growing in the\r\nUnited States. The use of nuts is more common than formerly but they\r\nare still a luxury. Wild nuts are scarcer, owing to the destruction\r\nof the trees for lumber. The food value of nuts is better understood\r\nthan formerly, and many articles of food are manufactured now from\r\nnuts. Nuts as meat substitutes have come into prominence within a few\r\nyears. This creates a demand which will increase. There is no danger of\r\nover-production. Now is the time to get into the nut business.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE SEEDS\r\n\r\nIn his book on \"Forestry\" Professor Gifford says: \"Collection of tree\r\nseeds should yield good returns if properly conducted.\" That is good\r\nnews, for if ever a crop was allowed to go to waste it is this crop of\r\ntree seeds. Any one who has seen a forest of young maples cut down by\r\nlawn mowers in the helplessness of their seed-leaf stage realizes that\r\nwith any sort of forethought those seeds might have been made a source\r\nof income.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gifford says a little farther on that many of the seeds of\r\nour native trees can be more easily obtained in Europe than in America.\r\nWe may learn many lessons in economy from our neighbours over there.\r\n\r\nBut who is going to harvest the tree seeds? A mechanic who earns a\r\ngood wage cannot afford to gather tree seeds; neither can a bank clerk\r\nunless he does the work in his vacation. But our boys and girls are\r\noften at a loss to find ways of earning money. Here is a crop they\r\ncan gather without danger of trespassing. There is a market for this\r\nharvest. Some tree seeds are difficult to get and expensive; red pine\r\nfor instance. Spruce trees produce seed only once in seven years. This\r\nkeeps the supply short. In a spruce seed year every seed should be\r\ngathered. Pecks of hard maple seeds are swept up by street cleaners\r\nevery year on our home street. They are worth a lot of money, yet the\r\nboys on the street never have all the cash they want to buy baseball\r\ngloves and circus tickets and bicycles. No enterprising reader of this\r\nbook need ever lack for pocket money.\r\n\r\nRemember, Professor Gifford said, \"Collection of tree seeds should\r\nyield good returns _if properly conducted_.\" Every business to\r\nbe successful must be conducted properly. There are some simple\r\nprinciples. You need not be an expert forester but the more you know\r\nabout trees the better. If a dealer buys six quarts of _red_ maple\r\nseeds of you he will be disappointed if you send him _silver_ maple,\r\ndiscouraged if you send him _sugar_ maple, and disgruntled if you send\r\nhim _ash_. Furthermore, he will not send you the money nor any orders\r\nfor more. If there is a maple tree with a peck of seed on it in your\r\nyard, in five minutes or less time you can find out what kind it is\r\nwith \"The Tree Book.\" Before the seeds are ripe write to a several seed\r\nmen and tell them what you have; ask if they want any, at what price,\r\nand on what date. Some trees ripen their seeds in the spring, shake\r\nthem off, and let the wind scatter them. In the case of some kinds,\r\nthe seeds sprout within a few days after they reach the ground. These\r\nshould be gathered as soon as ripe, spread out to dry for a few days,\r\nand planted within a few weeks at latest. Seeds of other kinds do not\r\ngrow till the following spring. None of these should be allowed to dry\r\ntoo thoroughly. Nuts and acorns for seed should not be allowed to get\r\ndry over winter. These should be packed in moist sand and kept cool but\r\nnot frozen. Cherry, plum and peach pits are better for being frozen.\r\n\r\nThe supply of white pine seed is never equal to the demand. The market\r\nprice is said to vary from two dollars fifty cents to four dollars\r\nfifty cents per pound. You get a little over a pound of seeds from a\r\nbushel of unopened cones. White pine trees require two years to mature\r\ntheir cones and they set seed only once in every four or five years.\r\nBut every year there will be some trees bearing seed. Nineteen hundred\r\nand four was a big \"on\" year in the New York white pine forests. You\r\ncan tell when the tiny cones first appear that a crop is coming. The\r\ncones should be watched as August wanes and gathered before they open.\r\nSeptember is the month as a general thing. Boys can earn thirty cents\r\nor so a bushel gathering the full cones. But I should not be satisfied\r\nto let the other fellow get all the profits just because he knows how\r\nto cure and market the seed. That is easy. Spread the cones out in the\r\nbarn to dry. Slat trays are best to get free circulation of air. You\r\ncan make these at odd times before the crop is ready. A fanning mill\r\ncomes in handy to thrash and free them from rubbish and imperfect seed.\r\nMarket them immediately to avoid loss. If you are to keep the seed for\r\nhome consumption, mix with dry sand and store in a cool but not too dry\r\nplace. If allowed to dry or freeze and thaw they lose their vitality.\r\nTree seeds need pretty careful handling.\r\n\r\nAny one interested in gathering tree seeds should get information from\r\nbooks and bulletins on forestry. He should write to firms who make\r\na specialty of selling tree seeds and they will help him by giving\r\ndirections about the treatment of seeds.\r\n\r\nDid you ever wonder where the nursery men get the thousands of apple\r\ntrees they sell every year? Go a step back of the budding or grafting\r\nthat is done in the nursery. Where did the little tree come from whose\r\ntop was cut off after the first bud was set? It came from a seed; just\r\nany apple seed. And where do apple seeds come from? From apples? Yes,\r\njust any apples. Did you ever make cider on your farm? You put in whole\r\napples, skin, core, stem, seeds, and all; shovelled them into the\r\nhopper. The pulp was squeezed dry and thrown away, wasn't it, at your\r\ncider mill? That is proof of the wastefulness of some good farmers. If\r\nthe pulp were washed in tubs, the seeds would find the bottom (or the\r\ntop) and they would bring a good price per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING CHRISTMAS GREENS\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time everybody who wanted Christmas greens had the fun of\r\ngathering his own. That was in the generation when all the grandmothers\r\nlived in the country and only the plain fathers and mothers and\r\nchildren lived in the cities. But now we children have grown up and\r\nour children want to go to grandmother's house for Christmas just as\r\nwe did. Can't you imagine how surprised and disappointed they are to\r\nfind their grandmothers living in city houses, even in flats? Didn't\r\nwe tell them about going out to gather holly and mistletoe and ground\r\npine and hemlock and even how we used to cut the Christmas tree itself\r\nin grandpa's woods? In the middle West where Christmas trees do not\r\ngrow in the woods we used to choose a shapely young oak. To make it\r\nlook like an evergreen we used to get grandpa to go out with his big\r\njack-knife and cut off the largest branches he could spare from the\r\nevergreens in the door yard. With good, strong twine we tied these\r\nto the branches of the oak. When all the decorations were on and the\r\noranges and the apples and the popcorn strings and the candles _and_\r\nthe presents, we children who had never seen a real live Christmas tree\r\ncouldn't have told the difference. We didn't even mind the fact that\r\nsome of the oak's outer branches were pine, some were spruce, some were\r\ncedar. It was all evergreen to us and all Christmassy. We were easy to\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nBut now--alas! The gathering of Christmas greens has been\r\ncommercialized. It has ceased to be fun, and has become a business. The\r\nboys and girls may share in the profits and perhaps get some fun out\r\nof it if they go about it right.\r\n\r\nHolly, which of all the Christmas greens is the most popular, is a\r\nhardy and beautiful tree, which grows wild in great numbers in the\r\nSouthern states and in the Chesapeake region. Many country boys and\r\ngirls make easy Christmas money from the holly trees in their own\r\nwoods. To these boys and girls I want to say \"Don't kill the goose that\r\nlays the golden egg.\" A tree with fine berries on it this year will,\r\nif treated right, produce a good crop again in a few years. Pruning is\r\ngood for a tree, but brutally hacking its head out destroys the tree's\r\nfuture, and the boy who does it is not a good citizen.\r\n\r\nHolly wood is close grained, light, and tough and is valuable in some\r\nforms of cabinet work. Here is an industry that might be developed as a\r\nside issue in the holly trade.\r\n\r\nThe best market calls for holly wreaths. I have a picture of a girl\r\nof fourteen who can make sixty wreaths in a day and she gets six and\r\na half cents for each. That is good wages for a girl of her age, but\r\nshe must get pretty tired making wreaths every minute all day long.\r\nIf she could help her brothers gather the holly for part of the time,\r\nit would be easier on her back. The wreaths are made on frames of\r\ntwigs, twisted into circles, and tied. Young twigs of any flexible\r\nshrub are used. Somebody has to gather these. It is a wonder that more\r\nholly trees are not planted in door yards. And wouldn't it be a good\r\nidea for some boys to begin a plantation of holly now so they can reap\r\nthe harvest later? Holly will not go out of fashion in a great many\r\nyears. But at the present rate the supply cannot last. The amount used\r\nevery year is past belief. From one small railway station 150,000\r\nwreaths! One year, several carloads were burned because the market was\r\noverstocked.\r\n\r\nThe time has come already when raising Christmas trees is necessary.\r\nThey still come up like weeds in the woods where enough mature ones\r\nare left to seed the bared hillsides. The harvest begins in November\r\nand the trees are cut and sorted, roped to preserve their branches,\r\nin bundles of eight or less or singly, and stacked along the roads\r\nto await shipment. Hundreds of thousands are harvested every year.\r\n\"No-Christmas-tree\" clubs are being formed now to try to stop this\r\nwastefulness. We go too much to extremes. One Christmas tree used to be\r\nenough for all the grandchildren; but nowadays every one must have his\r\nown. If our children's children are to have real Christmas trees the\r\nboys of to-day must plant the seeds of the beloved balsam fir.\r\n\r\nThe man who discovers and makes popular a new kind of Christmas greens\r\ndoes everybody a good turn. One of the most remarkable \"ten-strikes\"\r\never made along this line was a sort of accident. A man who calls\r\nhimself \"Caldwell, the woodsman,\" describes his experience as follows:\r\n\"It was several weeks before I found the evergreen that was to make\r\nthe town of Evergreen, Ala., famous throughout the decorative world.\r\nWandering through the woods one day, my attention was attracted to a\r\nbeautiful green vine hanging from the topmost limb of a small dead oak.\r\nI caught hold of the vine and pulled it down, and was much astonished\r\nat the ease with which it came out of the tree, and the fact that it\r\nseemed in no way injured by my rough treatment. On carrying it to\r\nmy new home, I arranged it around the mirror in my room, and, after\r\nleaving it there for about a week or ten days, found that it was as\r\nfresh and green as ever.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell saw that in wild Southern smilax he had found a plant that\r\npossessed all the good points required for wholesale decorations. It\r\nis used everywhere now. City florists cannot get enough of it. The\r\nplant is a perennial, renewing itself every year, and grows in greatest\r\nprofusion in its wild habitat. He had an uphill job, though, convincing\r\nthe fashionable florists of the value of this plant. But he persevered\r\nand now he ships five thousand cases of it a year at an average profit\r\nof one dollar per case.\r\n\r\nYoung long-leaf pines grow in the South and are now used extensively\r\nfor Christmas decoration in the North. It seems a pity to kill a pine\r\ntree every time one of these is cut, but in places where the seedlings\r\ncome up too thick for good forest growth cutting out some is a benefit.\r\nIf only the gatherers would be conservers as well!\r\n\r\nThe collecting of ferns in the woods is a business suited to the\r\ncountry boys and girls. This has grown to a really great enterprise\r\nsince the rage for country things has struck city people. There is\r\nsome sham about every fad of this kind, but the fern gatherers are not\r\nshamming. They do the real work. To succeed in this, one must not work\r\nhaphazard. He must know just what his customer wants, and the buyer\r\nmust know just what the collector can supply. _Ferns_ is a big group of\r\nplants, and some of them you couldn't sell. If Christmas ferns grow\r\nplentifully in your woods, you can gather them by the thousand fronds.\r\nBut will the florist buy those leaves which have the brown spots (or\r\nspores) on the under side? Find out before you waste your time. Those\r\nspores are more valuable in the woods than on the garbage heap. The\r\nboys who pull the plants up by the roots are killing their own goose.\r\nThe fern can spare all the perfect leaves you find on it in the fall\r\nwithout much if any damage. A new crop will be forthcoming next year\r\nif the roots are undisturbed. Scissors and care used in gathering only\r\ngood leaves will pay now, as well as in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of wild things that deserve more popularity.\r\nBitter-sweet is lovely and lasts forever, nearly. You seldom see it\r\nin the market, though. Sumach too, has great decorative value, yet\r\nwhoever saw it in a florist's window? Cattails, pussy willows, spice\r\nbush, dogwood flowers and berries, Solomon's seal, and a score of other\r\nwild flowers are already in use. But there are others you may be able\r\nto introduce to city people. It is surprising what they will buy and\r\nadmire if it comes from the country. I rode on a suburban car one day\r\nbehind an armful of poison ivy. It was brilliantly beautiful and I\r\nsuspect the gatherer wished I had kept still when I told her what it\r\nwas. If she hadn't had a child with her, I should have let her risk it.\r\nMaybe she was immune. Most people are. The funniest thing I ever saw\r\nfor sale was a basket of skunk-cabbage flowers on Broadway. The shrewd\r\nold farmer who had them for sale got a quarter for two. He called them\r\nJapanese lilies.\r\n\r\nI wonder that the winter berry has not found more favour for\r\ndecoration. Two kinds of shrubs with this name are common in our\r\nNorthern woods. They are both hollies, but, unlike the Southern holly,\r\nlose their leaves. One has bright orange-coloured berries, the other\r\nis covered with a great profusion of bright scarlet fruits. Nothing\r\ncould be more effective in a large vase in a dark corner. They light up\r\nhandsomely at night or in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL PLANTS\r\n\r\nThere are a good many kinds of aromatic roots and medicinal plants\r\nwhich are kept in stock at drug stores. Some of them are rare and bring\r\na good price; like golden seal at a dollar or over per pound. Digitalis\r\nin the drug store is foxglove in the garden; but who ever thinks of\r\ngathering its leaves and finding a market for them? Somebody must or\r\nthe supply would run out. The leaves of the second year's growth are\r\ndried for medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nWild ginger root is used in preserves and for confectionery. I have\r\nseen it in market and wondered who gathered it. Preserved calamus root,\r\ntoo; who buys that unless it is Br'er Rabbit? There is a Bulletin\r\nof the Department of Agriculture on \"Weeds Used in Medicine\" that\r\nyou ought to have. The list of weeds used in medicine will certainly\r\nsurprise the unenlightened. How do you know that your doctor isn't\r\ndosing you with burdock, dandelion, dock, pokeweed, foxglove, mullein,\r\ntansy, boneset, catnip, horehound, fleabane, yarrow, or jimson weed?\r\nAll these and many more common weeds are collected by somebody, dried,\r\nand used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOKEWEED\r\n\r\nPokeweed roots are poisonous. The berries are not. They are used to\r\nmake a syrup with which to colour frosting for cakes and the like.\r\nReceipts for this are to be found in many cook books. But the best\r\npart of pokeweed is not the fruit. In early spring, when asparagus is\r\nexpensive and scarce, the pokeweed shoots grow rank and as thick as\r\nyour thumb in fence corners. They will take entire possession of a\r\nlarge garden in two years if given the least encouragement. I cut the\r\nstems when about a foot in height. They are covered with short leaves\r\nwhich are best removed except at the end of the shoot. Cook exactly\r\nlike asparagus, and dress with butter or cream. They resemble asparagus\r\nsomewhat, but are more delicate in flavour and less woody in texture.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALKING STICKS\r\n\r\nI once knew a stubborn man who was convinced that an unproductive\r\norchard full of old gnarled trees on his place was good for nothing\r\nbut firewood. He had the trunks cut into stove lengths and then burned\r\nthe brush in ten huge piles. As the last pile was about to be fired, a\r\nmanufacturer of umbrella handles offered him ten dollars for what was\r\nleft. Imagine his feelings! Thousands of handsome walking sticks and\r\numbrella handles are made of apple, cherry, and such woods. The makers\r\ncannot get enough of it and yet every year how much salable wood must\r\nbe burned in the form of prunings. There is a true story of a young man\r\nin Florida who paid his way through college by collecting orange wood\r\nsuitable for walking sticks. This wood is still popular for the same\r\npurpose, and the idea is worth passing along.\r\n\r\nRoots of quaint or grotesque shape are often found in the woods and may\r\nbe used as handles of umbrellas or walking sticks. I have a stick made\r\nof a small sapling upon which a branch of bitter-sweet had entwined.\r\nAs the sapling grew in circumference, the coils of the climber had not\r\nbeen loosened but had become imbedded in the wood of the little tree.\r\nThe long vine was not cut off, but trimmed and wound round and round\r\nat the head of the stick to make it large enough to grasp comfortably.\r\nSuch a stick is an interesting gift for a friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Walking sticks decorated by nature]\r\n\r\nAnother pretty bit of nature's handiwork is a walking stick engraved by\r\nthe engraver beetle. These little insects make their burrows just under\r\nthe bark and they often work on small branches of a great variety of\r\nforest trees. Remove a bit of loose bark and ten to one you will find\r\nit carved with a more or less intricate design by the engraver beetle.\r\nCould you do as neat a piece of work? A thorough brushing and oiling\r\nare all that such a stick needs to make it an ornament to the hat-rack.\r\n\r\nSticks intended for handles or canes cannot be bent when dry. They\r\nshould be steamed until flexible or buried in hot, wet sand till you\r\ncan shape them. Boiling for a half-hour will sometimes make a piece\r\nsupple. Fasten in the desired shape with stout cords and dry thoroughly\r\nbefore releasing. Sticks that are slightly crooked may be straightened\r\nby putting them into a bundle with perfectly straight pieces and\r\nwinding with strong rope; let them dry in this bundle. Sticks which\r\nare to be peeled should be partially dried first but not by artificial\r\nheat. Rapid drying is likely to split the stick.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS FOR CITY CHILDREN\r\n\r\nChildren who live in the country part or all of the year do not know\r\nhow much pleasure they might give if they would gather wild flowers\r\nand send them to city children. There is a society which distributes\r\nflowers thus collected in New York but maybe there is none in the\r\ncity near you. The commonest flowers, even the weeds like daisies and\r\ndandelions and black-eyed Susans, are eagerly taken home by children\r\nwho are so poor that they never even saw a park, much less a meadow. In\r\none city school over two hundred children had never seen a dandelion.\r\nA lady once started with a bunch of daisies to give to a city friend.\r\nShe was met at the ferry with, \"Please give me a flower.\" She went on\r\nup the street. \"Won't chu gimme one o'yer flowers?\" Children seemed to\r\nappear from every direction; maybe they were always there and she had\r\nnot noticed them before. The grown-up friend did not get any flowers\r\nbut she got a good story instead. Mr. Jacob Riis founded a flower\r\nmission on a similar experience. It is fun to gather flowers anyhow,\r\nand if you can make some other child happy even for a few minutes it\r\nwould be even more fun. This is only a hint.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELF FUNGI\r\n\r\nHave you seen those outgrowths on dying and dead trees which stand out\r\nlike a shelf? They are called bracket or shelf fungi. If you have an\r\nartist friend who can make beautiful things on these by carving them\r\nwith little engraving tools, gather all you see for her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Verne Morton. Gathering Wild Flowers for\r\nCity Children]\r\n\r\n\r\nDANDELION GREENS\r\n\r\nDo your folks cook dandelion greens? Mine never did but since seeing\r\nthem for sale at so much per half-peck I have come to think that they\r\nmust be eatable and have wished we had gathered and sold the bushels\r\nthat grew in our lawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN HUSKS\r\n\r\nCorn husks is a crop that used to be more eagerly harvested than now.\r\nIn the corn belt, where the husking is done in the field, the husk is\r\nleft on the stalk and would therefore be hard to get. But where corn\r\nis snapped, husk and all, and left to be husked at leisure in field\r\nor barn, the husks can be saved with profit. For summer beds they are\r\ncheaper and softer than hay. For porch cushions they are far superior\r\nto excelsior. For braiding into mats they are really valuable, and\r\nwell-made ones bring a good price.\r\n\r\nCornstalks yield another crop that is little known. Collectors of\r\ninsects use thin sheets of cornstalk pith to line their insect boxes.\r\nIt is peculiarly adapted to this purpose. They cannot get a large\r\nsupply of it, yet what boy in any great corn state could not get a ton\r\nof it if he had the gumption. Ask the entomology man in your state\r\nExperiment Station, if he needs cornstalk pith. If you live in a cactus\r\ncountry, ask him if he could use thin slices of the pith from the\r\nflower stalk of the giant cacti.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGRANT HERBS AND GRASSES\r\n\r\nOf the fragrant herbs, grasses, and shrubs which nature provides,\r\nnothing is more in demand than sweet grass. In the parts of the country\r\nwhere it is abundant, people still gather and cure it and make useful\r\nbaskets and mats of it. Sometimes it is combined with birch bark or\r\nporcupine quills or both by skilful Indian women who learned how from\r\ntheir grandmothers. The good market for such things will keep the art\r\nof basket making from becoming a lost one.\r\n\r\nIndian maidens are not the only ones who have learned basket weaving.\r\nIndeed this has almost taken the place of patchwork, for girls, except\r\nin very old-fashioned families. Clever girls will not be content to use\r\nonly such conventional materials as raffia and reeds. Often the colours\r\nof those you buy are so crude that you cannot make really artistic\r\nthings of them. Some of the native grasses, flower stalks, strips of\r\npalmetto, rushes, soft inner corn husks, cat-tail leaves, and sedges\r\nare used. One basket maker has used the shiny brown stems of maidenhair\r\nferns and the effect is very pretty. Another uses long pine needles in\r\nher weaving. Most of these materials are unfit for use when dry and\r\nbrittle, but books on basketry tell just how they can be made pliable.\r\nGrasses are usually at their best just after flowering.\r\n\r\nThe dried leaves of sweet fern, sweet clover in blossom, balsam fir,\r\nand bayberry make sweet smelling cushions and bags for bureau drawers\r\nand couches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALSAM LEAVES\r\n\r\nIn gathering what you hear called \"pine needles\" for pillows be sure\r\nyou have the right kind of trees before you begin to gather the leaves.\r\nPine needles are long and stiff and sharp. A pillow made of dried\r\nones would not be a very fragrant nor a very comfortable thing. What\r\nyou want is the short, soft leaves of balsam fir. These retain their\r\nwholesome odour after being dried. In five minutes you can learn to\r\ntell the balsam from spruce, hemlock, and cedar, the other common\r\nshort-leaved native evergreens.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRCH BARK\r\n\r\nCamping parties often leave a trail of devastation behind them which\r\nwould shock the most hardened and wasteful one of the lot. This is\r\nlargely if not entirely because they are ignorant, not because they\r\nare intentionally breakers of the laws of the woods. Indeed they are\r\nprobably very ardent believers in the theory of conservation. Has it\r\nnever occurred to them to practise it?\r\n\r\nIn the matter of collecting birch bark much damage has been done.\r\nSome people in whom you have confidence say: \"Oh, no. It doesn't hurt\r\nthe tree.\" So you strip off layer after layer; such a fascinating\r\noccupation, I do not wonder you hardly know when to stop. But read what\r\nMiss Rogers says in \"The Tree Book:\" \"The feminine tourist in Northern\r\nwoods loses no time in supplying herself with birch bark note-paper.\r\nThe bark is usually removed in thick plates, from which the thin sheets\r\nmay be stripped at leisure. These sheets are orange-coloured, with a\r\nfaint purplish bloom upon them and darker purplish lines. Alas! for the\r\nzeal of these tourists. They usually cut too deep, and the strip that\r\ntears off so evenly girdles and kills the tree, because nothing is left\r\nto protect the living cambium. A black band (of mourning) soon marks\r\nthe doomed tree, and it eventually snaps off in the wind.\"\r\n\r\nI know a girl who killed thirty-seven beautiful birch trees before any\r\none showed her how she could get plenty of bark and leave some for the\r\ntree beside. She was perfectly horrified when she realized what she had\r\ndone. So few people know that the live part of the tree is not at the\r\nheart--that is quite dead--but just under the skin. Cut off the bark in\r\nany large quantities and your tree falls an easy prey to disease.\r\n\r\nHiawatha was not the first Indian to use the canoe birch for practical\r\npurposes. His ancestors used this bark for all sorts of utensils,\r\ndishes, baskets, buckets, and for their canoes. They sewed the pieces\r\ntogether with fibrous roots and filled the cracks with wild gum\r\nor pitch. The Indians of nowadays have degenerated and the things\r\nthey make have become less artistic. I lately saw a buckskin pouch,\r\ndecorated with exquisitely woven bead work, in simple but charming\r\ndesign. It was a piece of real Indian handiwork, but the whole effect\r\nwas spoiled by a lining of coarse red and blue and green gingham and\r\nthe pouch flap was secured by a thong looped over a large white agate\r\nshirt button!\r\n\r\nIn trying to imitate the Indians at their game of making things out\r\nof birch bark, quills, sweet grass, and other natural materials, let\r\nus keep clear of the shops and use only what combines naturally and\r\nartistically.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORCUPINE QUILLS\r\n\r\n\"Give me of your quills, O hedgehog!\" Hiawatha was talking to a\r\nporcupine, for the chances are that he never saw a hedgehog. Poets\r\nought to know better than to confuse their \"critters.\"\r\n\r\nA real Indian boy in the woods knows that porcupines give up their\r\nquills all too willingly. It is strange that the wild beasts of prey\r\nand the domestic dogs cannot learn this and let the porcupine alone.\r\nThey have no quarrel with him. He eats the bark of trees, and goes\r\nabout his own affairs. There isn't a word of truth in the story of his\r\nshooting his quills. No doubt he would if he could, if sore pressed,\r\nbut he can't. He bristles them up when attacked and then woe be to\r\nthe tender nose that touches the sharp points! The quills let go of\r\ntheir original owner very easily, but being barbed on their outer end\r\nthey bury themselves in the soft parts of the attacking animal. With\r\nno thought of revenge in his rather witless head, the porcupine may\r\npronounce the death sentence on his captor.\r\n\r\nPorcupines are hunted for their quills and easily captured by men as\r\nthey are slow and awkward. The quills take a pretty polish and their\r\ncream white and shaded brown colours blend softly with the tints of\r\nbirch bark and wild grasses with which they are combined by basket and\r\nmat weavers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE SUGAR MAKING\r\n\r\nMost of the fifty million or so pounds of maple sugar made in this\r\ncountry is made in six states, Vermont, New York, Ohio, Michigan,\r\nPennsylvania, and New Hampshire. The boys and girls of these states\r\nhave exceptional opportunities of studying the mysteries of tree life\r\nand of sharing the bounty the maples provide. I was not brought up\r\nin any one of the above-named states, yet I remember the maple sugar\r\nmaking in the woods along the river. One of my early recollections is\r\nof a party of Indian women, on piebald ponies, bringing fascinating\r\nheart-shaped cakes of maple sugar to exchange at the farm for fresh\r\nmeat. Theirs were no pale, anæmic, delicate squares of creamy texture,\r\nbut ruddy and hard. Less discriminating than now, we children ate with\r\nrelish the coarse sugar almost black from the bits of bark, chips of\r\nleaves, and twigs which had undoubtedly been boiled with it. Nor did we\r\ninnocents turn from it with loathing when told by a teasing uncle that\r\nits colour was due to the sirup having been strained by the Indians\r\nthrough their blankets. We didn't believe it then and I don't yet. How\r\nvery bad for the blankets!\r\n\r\nThe Indians discovered the maple sugar industry long before they\r\nthemselves were discovered by white people. They taught our New\r\nEngland ancestors how to tap the trees and boil down the sirup and how\r\nto \"sugar off.\" They had little or no sugar except what the maples\r\nsupplied. The Indians had very primitive ways of tapping the trees,\r\ncollecting the sap, boiling, and sugaring. These ways have been\r\nimproved in the last three hundred years. Although wooden buckets and\r\nhome-made spiles made of sumach branches may still be used where only a\r\nfew trees are tapped, the up-to-date sugar maker has modern, patent,\r\ncovered buckets, spouts, and evaporators. He uses a thermometer and\r\nknows \"for sure\" when to shut off his fire if he wants to make sirup,\r\nand how high the temperature may go to make the best sugar. He knows,\r\ntoo, whether he can afford to make sugar which tests eighty per cent.\r\nor ninety per cent. pure and get the bounty, if his state pays one, or\r\nif it costs him less labour and expense to sell his entire product in\r\nthe form of sirup.\r\n\r\nBut scientific methods can never take away the charm of maple sugar\r\nmaking. There is so much yet to be learned from the trees about the\r\nwhys and wherefores of their behaviour during the harvest, that our\r\ninterest in maple products increases as our interest in mere \"sweets\"\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nIf you have a \"sugar bush\" planted by your great-grandfather, the\r\nchances are that you have had annual opportunities to help in making\r\nsugar, ever since you could drive a horse on frosty mornings to collect\r\nthe sap. But I am going to suppose that during the winter you have\r\nbeen reading \"Trees Every Child Should Know\" and have been identifying\r\nthe trees about your home. The maples are about the easiest trees to\r\nidentify when leafless. Suppose you have found several maple trees,\r\ngood big ones, right in your own door yard. The hard or sugar maple is\r\nthe one most frequently used for sugar making, but experiments show\r\nthat soft maples make good sugar too. It isn't worth while to tap trees\r\nin winter. The sugar is in them all right because the leaves were\r\nstoring up the starch all summer. This starch has been changed to sugar\r\nin the living cells of the wood. But you couldn't get any of it until\r\nthe sap begins to run. It does this with the first warm, sunny days of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nAfter locating all the trees you expect to tap, you must make some\r\npreparations so that you will not lose any time at the critical moment.\r\nI knew one boy who got his bit and brace out the first thing, bored\r\na hole in the tree trunk, and lost about a gallon of sap before he\r\ncould get a spile and a pail ready to catch it. You want a spile or\r\nspout for every pail and a pail for every tree. The patent spouts have\r\na hook upon which the bucket hangs. If you use sumach spiles you may\r\nhave to set the bucket on the ground where it is likely to get dirt in\r\nit, tip over, and it is so far from the spile that the wind blows the\r\nsap away from the pail entirely. The pails should be generous in size\r\nunless you expect to collect the sap more than once a day. An average\r\nyield per day is five quarts per hole. The pails and spiles should be\r\nin readiness before \"sugar weather\" begins. Beside the pails and spouts\r\nyou need a wooden mallet, and a bit and brace or small auger for the\r\noutdoor work; a kettle for boiling down, a large jar to put the fresh\r\nsap in, and a dipper to dip it out, a strainer and a skimmer for the\r\nindoor work. If you boil your sap outdoors using cheap fuel you will\r\nmake more out of your enterprise than if you use coal or gas. A good\r\nsap-running day is a warm, sunny day after a frosty night. While the\r\ndays and nights are about the same temperature the sap does not run\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe best place to tap a tree is about four feet from the ground, and\r\nfortunately that is the easiest place to work with the auger or bit.\r\nThe bit should be bright and sharp; a dull, rusty bit makes a shabby\r\nhole in the wood with a lot of woody shreds which clog the flow of sap.\r\nClean out the hole, as any chips left in stop the flow in the same\r\nway. The bit or auger used should be about one half inch in diameter.\r\nA bigger hole might give more sap but would injure the tree more. The\r\ntree fills up the smaller hole in a few years with new tissue. The\r\nhole should not be deeper than three inches. It is a mistake to think\r\nthat the centre of the tree holds the sap. As a matter of fact there\r\nis less there than anywhere else and more as you near the surface. The\r\nliving, active part of the tree is just under the bark. It is necessary\r\nto say this over and over again so that people will get it into their\r\nminds. The Indians used to tap the trees on the south side because\r\nthey said more sap came from that side. Experiments show that on warm,\r\nsunny days, this is the case. On cloudy days, however, sap comes about\r\nequally from holes on all sides. If the trees have been tapped before,\r\nit is best to tap at some distance from the old places. The size of the\r\nauger and spile should be the same and the latter should be forced in\r\ntightly, and not fall out when the pail is full.\r\n\r\nPure sap makes the clearest sirup and the lightest-coloured sugar.\r\nEvery bit of dust, leaves, twigs, or bark that gets into the pail\r\nleaves its mark on the sugar even though strained out. So covers on\r\nthe pails are preferred if one can afford them. Most of the sap runs\r\nbetween nine o'clock in the morning and noon. It has been found by\r\ntests that this morning sap has more sugar in it than that which runs\r\nlater in the day. It is the custom in some places to throw away the ice\r\nif the sap freezes. This is very wasteful, for this ice contains about\r\nthirty per cent. of the sugar. Of course, melting ice is expensive\r\nbusiness so one must try not to let his sap freeze. The sap in the\r\nstorage jar or tank must not be allowed to get warm, though, as it may\r\nsour. It should be boiled as soon after gathering as possible to ensure\r\nbest results.\r\n\r\nMaple sap contains other ingredients beside water and sugar. In\r\nboiling, the water passes off in steam and the sugar and other solids\r\nremain. The changes in colour from clear sap to dark brown sugar is\r\ncaused by the action of the heat upon the sugar and other substances.\r\nAll sugar makers know that the lightest coloured sirup and sugar can\r\nbe made from the earliest run of sap. That is because, as the season\r\nadvances, more of the lime, potash, magnesia, and other substances are\r\npresent in the sap. You see the tree does not stop work just because\r\nyou tap it; and the sap is changing every day until, by the time the\r\nbuds begin to open, the sap is so changed that it does not make good\r\nsugar at all.\r\n\r\nWater boils when it reaches two hundred and twelve degrees, Fahrenheit,\r\nas any thermometer will tell you. In fact, you cannot heat water\r\nhotter than two hundred and twelve degrees, for at that temperature\r\nthe water becomes steam. A mixture of sugar and water will not boil\r\nat two hundred and twelve degrees but requires a higher temperature.\r\nTherefore, as the water passes off the sap in boiling, and as the\r\namount of sugar per gallon increases, it gets hotter and hotter. It is\r\nnecessary to watch boiling sap carefully to avoid burning. In making\r\nsirup it is important to have it just thick enough to taste right and\r\nnot so thick that it will granulate. Sirup that weighs eleven pounds to\r\nthe gallon has long been considered as \"just right,\" and it has been\r\nfound by testing that if you take the sirup off the fire just as soon\r\nas the thermometer registers two hundred and nineteen degrees it will\r\nweigh eleven pounds to the gallon and will not granulate. If you take\r\nit off when the thermometer says two hundred and sixteen degrees your\r\nsirup will be a pretty fair article, but you cannot expect to get as\r\ngood a price for it, because it has more water in it than there should\r\nbe in a prime article.\r\n\r\nWhen the sirup has boiled down to nearly two hundred and nineteen\r\ndegrees, it is necessary to pour it off or strain it through thick\r\ncloths to take out the dark-coloured impurities. After this the sirup\r\nis heated again to boiling point and sealed in jars or cans.\r\n\r\nA gallon of sirup will make between eight and ten pounds of sugar.\r\nCan you afford to make your sirup into sugar at this rate? It will\r\ndepend upon the relative price of sugar and sirup, the cost of your\r\nfuel and the value of your time and whether your market wants sugar or\r\nsirup. There is a good and increasing demand for pure maple products,\r\nespecially in the form of confectionery. If you can work up a market\r\nfor fancy maple sugar in the form of bonbons it will bring a fancy\r\nprice. This is not so hard as it sounds but it takes enterprise and\r\ngumption and perseverance and knack. Here is a job where brothers and\r\nsisters can work together to very great advantage and add to their\r\nstore of college money by discovering and harvesting a crop right at\r\nhome which in many cases has been neglected for decades. If you have\r\ncity cousins they will help you sell your products among their mates.\r\nIt will pay you to prepare small sample parcels, enough to whet the\r\nappetite but not enough to satisfy. I remember receiving a number of\r\npackages of maple cream from a Vermont friend. The price per pound\r\nwas equal to that of the finest candy and I wanted to share with all\r\nmy friends. But I couldn't afford to give away pound packages to\r\neverybody. I might have created a large demand for this delicious\r\nconfectionery, had I been able to get sample packages to give to\r\nfriends. This year I am to have them.\r\n\r\nIt adds wonderfully to the attractiveness of maple sugar to have each\r\ncake or bonbon wrapped in its own piece of waxed paper. This is a kind\r\nof guarantee of dainty handling that is appreciated by the purchaser.\r\nA shoe box is hardly a dainty parcel, yet I know of one unimaginative\r\nmaple sugar man who packs his cakes in just such boxes. There is a\r\nchance for some one to \"make a hit\" in this line.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RICE\r\n\r\nWild rice sells for two or three times the price of ordinary rice and\r\nthe supply never meets the demand.\r\n\r\n\"But who wants it and what for?\"\r\n\r\nWild rice is not likely to become a popular breakfast food except\r\namong the Ojibways, yet a lot of time and effort have been spent on\r\ntrying to find out how to grow crops of it. The reason for this is\r\nthat nothing fattens wild ducks, geese, and other game birds quite so\r\nsatisfactorily. Where the wild rice flourishes there is the hunter's\r\nparadise in September. This is reason enough for wanting to grow wild\r\nrice. When our true American sportsmen awoke to the fact that game was\r\nscarce and realized why, they set about protecting the wild fowl and\r\nstudying their habits so as to better supply ideal conditions for the\r\nremnant to increase. This is conservation and boys that help in such\r\nenterprises are truly patriotic citizens.\r\n\r\nWild rice grows in swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish rivers covering\r\nimmense areas in the Mississippi Valley and the middle North-western\r\nstates. Mud is a necessity to its growth. It grows taller than a man's\r\nheight above the water and its seed comes in a loose spray at the very\r\ntop of each stalk. The plants die every year and new ones come up from\r\nseed. The grain begins to ripen early in September and keeps on until\r\nheavy frosts. This is all right for ducks but it makes harvesting a\r\nvery difficult task. The Indian women of the wild rice regions go out\r\nand shake the heads over their boats. They have to go again and again.\r\nIf they left it till all the grain had ripened they would get very\r\nlittle seed, because the wild rice falls as soon as it is ripe and lies\r\nin the mud till spring. The long-hid secret of the many failures to get\r\nwild rice to grow from seed was discovered by some scientist to be this\r\nhabit of lying in the mud over winter. Thoroughly dried seed does not\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nWild rice is queer looking stuff. The grains are black and very long\r\nand slender. Some of them are an inch long. It is said by some to be\r\nvery good eating, especially as prepared by the Indians. They parch it\r\nusually, but sometimes it is made into a sort of porridge and eaten\r\nwith maple sugar.\r\n\r\nPractically, the best market for wild rice will always be amongst\r\nthe wild fowl and it is a sportsman-like act to gather the seed and\r\npropagate it for their sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING SPRUCE GUM\r\n\r\nIf spruce gum were used only in the manufacture of \"chewing-gum\"\r\nwe had much better let the crop go unharvested. It serves a useful\r\npurpose in the tree which produces it. When you have a cut or bruise\r\nyou like to put something on it that excludes the air. The tree acts\r\non the same principle. The live part of the tree is just underneath\r\nthe bark. Trees are liable to many kinds of injuries. The winter winds\r\nstrain them sometimes to the point of splitting, a heedless woodsman\r\nblazes the bark in passing, wild creatures gnaw or scratch the trunks,\r\na woodpecker digs a hole through the bark. Any injury of the living\r\nlayer is like a \"hurry call\" to the cells where the resin is stored.\r\nThese cells are the health department. They send out to the injured\r\npart a covering of balm, a salve which seals the wound effectually from\r\ncontact with the air. We cannot say that the tree knows that the air is\r\nfull of the germs of decay and that to let them get a foothold means\r\ndecay and sure death; but the tree has something that serves the same\r\npurpose as knowledge.\r\n\r\nPhysicians make use of the resinous gums in preparing medicines, and\r\ndruggists always try to keep a stock of spruce gum on hand. Collectors\r\nfind their best market for it in the drug trade. The best quality\r\nbrings as high as one dollar and fifty cents a pound, while one dollar\r\na pound is not too much to expect for the average collection.\r\n\r\nAll the spruces yield gum, but the best quality is said to come from\r\nthe white spruce. The first thing to do then is to learn to recognize\r\nthis tree on sight. It will take you and a tree book together about\r\nfive minutes to distinguish between the three short-leaved evergreens\r\nwhich look so much alike to a novice, the firs, the hemlocks, and the\r\nspruces. When once you know the spruces by the looks or the feel, you\r\nwill begin to know the white from the red and black spruce by the\r\ncolour. Everything about the white spruce is paler than the others.\r\nThe foliage is light, almost pea-green, and the bark is not ruddy but\r\ngrayish-brown. There are thousands of acres of spruce woods in our\r\nnorthern Central and New England states. Boys and girls on camping\r\ntrips can sometimes collect spruce gum enough to pay expenses and have\r\nfun doing it. The only equipment necessary is a heavy pocket knife, a\r\ngum spud, a canvas sack, a strong hand, and a pair of sharp eyes. The\r\neyes will get sharper as the knife gets dull and the tree you found\r\nnothing on in the morning of your first day may yield a good harvest on\r\nthe return trip. You will not be able to buy a gum spud, but a tinsmith\r\ncan make one for you at small cost, according to these directions:\r\nSolder a piece of galvanized iron into a funnel six inches deep, three\r\ninches across the top, and one inch in diameter at the bottom. A\r\nferrule two or three inches deep and an inch in diameter is fitted into\r\nthe bottom of the funnel and soldered in tight. Fit a long handle into\r\nthis affair and your spud is ready. You may count on a good majority of\r\nthe gum you find being out of reach of the knife but the spud gets it\r\ndown very successfully.\r\n\r\nThe best place to find spruce gum is undoubtedly in woods where no\r\none has been \"gummin'\" before, at least not for five years or so. The\r\nmost plentiful supply is said to be on slopes where the trees have a\r\nsouthern exposure, and the smaller trees yield more gum than the big\r\nones. Your work is not done with collecting, for in order to get the\r\nbest price you must present a fancy grade to the market. If your gum\r\nis all thrown in together, good, bad, and indifferent, your average\r\nprice is pretty sure to be less than for a carefully cleaned and sorted\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nSpruce gum can be collected in summer or winter. Which time is better\r\nfor you depends on circumstances. There is a peculiar charm about gum\r\nhunting on snow-shoes. A young man suffering from too little fresh air\r\nand attendant ills might find his health among the spruce trees while\r\nthe gum paid the bills.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure these are good mushrooms?\" I asked my seven-year-old\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'm sure. Don't you know Aunt J---- says that all the _Coprinæ_\r\nare edible?\"\r\n\r\nThis is a true story and it only goes to show that even a small child\r\ncan learn that there are a small number of unmistakable mushrooms,\r\nwhich are edible and there is never any danger of being wrong about\r\nthem. The puff-balls, for example, are all good to eat. When we found\r\nthe neighbour's children kicking great white spongy puff-balls in the\r\npasture we begged them to let us have them instead. \"Pap says they're\r\np'ison\" was their reply, but we heeded them not for their \"pap\" was\r\nno oracle of ours. We were quite willing the children should go on\r\nthinking puff-balls were poison, if only they would not use them for\r\nfoot-balls. Nobody in his senses would try to eat puff-balls after they\r\nhave begun to turn black or brown. But when they are white and tender\r\nthey are very good. Skin the ball, slice thin, add water and a little\r\nsalt, and stew for twenty minutes or so. Drain and dress with cream\r\nsauce. No doubt puff-ball slices broiled over a camp fire with bacon\r\nwould be good. I wish I had tried it, but I never have. We will agree\r\nthat no puff-ball can compare with the pink-gilled meadow mushroom, but\r\nwe make no such claims for it.\r\n\r\nThe best place to look for puff-balls is in old pastures in late summer\r\nand early fall. The giants are sometimes as big as a milk pail. The\r\npear-shaped ones grow on tree stumps and are as big as your fist or\r\nsmaller. There is an endless variety of tiny ones of all sorts which\r\nare either too tough or too small to bother with. But no puff-ball is\r\n\"p'ison,\" not one.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls who like to harvest nature's crops are missing a lot\r\nof fun besides many pecks of delicious food by neglecting the common\r\nedible mushrooms. If you know a few good ones you are perfectly safe.\r\nWhen you have seen them a few times and gathered them a few times and\r\ncompared them with photographs you are ready to eat them. I should\r\nadvise always to go mushroom hunting first with some experienced\r\nperson. Personally I take no risks. For instance if my book tells me\r\nthat \"dangerous fungi resembling this species and sometimes found in\r\ncompany with it--etc.,\" that's enough. Say no more. I let that one\r\nalone. I do not like the company it keeps, and it may be a sheep in\r\nwolf's clothing. In my list of edible fungi, common in New York and\r\nNew Jersey, there are less than a dozen kinds. No one of these looks\r\nenough like any other fungus to be mistaken for it. A few good looks at\r\nthem will fix them in the memory. These are morels, meadow mushrooms,\r\nshaggy-manes, inky-caps, oyster mushroom, puff-balls, coral fungi,\r\nand chanterelles. The open season for morels is in early spring, when\r\narbutus is blossoming, and later. Coral fungi and chanterelles are\r\nat their finest in midsummer, puff-balls in September, inky-caps and\r\nshaggy-manes in October, and we ate oyster mushrooms on January first\r\none year, though they appear earlier. The meadow mushroom with white\r\nflesh and pink gills is grown indoors and is seen in the market from\r\nfall till spring, but nature's crop must be harvested in fall before\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n_Morels._--Morels look like nothing else. When full sized they are six\r\ninches high. The hollow stalk is as large as your finger and about half\r\nthe length of the whole. The top or cap is brownish and so covered with\r\nridges and wrinkles that it would never be mistaken for anything else\r\nin the world. You ought to see a picture of it because it is difficult\r\nto describe so irregular an object. Look it up in some mushroom book or\r\nbulletin in your library.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nYou never know just where morels may appear. We found them in our\r\ngarden once. They come up right among the weeds or dead leaves. I have\r\noften found them along forest by-paths, especially in wet weather in\r\nspring. They are delectable. Perhaps you have eaten delicately broiled\r\nslices of tenderloin of young pig. Morels do not taste like this--they\r\nlook a little like it--they taste very much better. You taste them.\r\n\r\n_Coral Fungi._--The coral fungi that I eat look like chunks of pinkish\r\nor cream white organ pipe coral. They are fleshy, soft, yet firm enough\r\nto keep their shape, and the whole mass is made up of tiny thread-or\r\nrod-like parts of many branches. There is a fine one which looks like a\r\ncauliflower though more yellow. I have found the pink and creamy ones\r\non fallen and decayed tree trunks in deep, cool woods in midsummer.\r\nOthers equally good grow in thin woods or open places. They vary in\r\nsize from chunks as big as a walnut to those as big or bigger than\r\nyour fist. They need careful cleansing under a faucet. Some cooks soak\r\nthem first in cold water into which they put a little vinegar or lemon\r\njuice. They then fry in butter. Another way is to stew till tender in\r\nwater with lemon juice in it. Then drain and dress with cream sauce.\r\n\r\n_Puff-balls._--What country child has not puffed the \"smoke\" from the\r\nhole in the top of the tough-skinned little brown balls they find in\r\nthe fields in autumn? Children generally believe them to be deadly\r\npoison and call them \"devil's snuff-boxes.\" Their life history is very\r\nlike that of other fungi. The most of the year these flowerless and\r\nleafless plants spend underground. They spread in a tangle of fine\r\nthreads all through the soil wherever they find decaying vegetable\r\nmatter upon which to feed. When their time comes, little white balls\r\npush out and up from the threads. These come to the surface and we know\r\nthem by their shapes and sizes as our different kinds of puff-balls,\r\nmushrooms, or other fungi.\r\n\r\nThe puff-balls are white and look like fine cream cheese when they\r\nfirst appear. Their business is to ripen their spores, scatter them,\r\nand disappear. The brown smoke or dust of the ripe puff-ball is blown\r\nabout by the wind and finds its way into the earth in time; each tiny\r\nspore or grain of dust can start a new mat of threads down underground.\r\nWhen you puff the devil's snuff-box you are doing the plant just the\r\nkindness it was waiting for. When a cow steps on a ripe giant puff-ball\r\na great smoke goes up, and the breeze catches the dust. Some of the\r\nspores may be carried on the wind or on the cow's foot to far distant\r\npastures, there to settle down and start a new puff-ball colony. It is\r\njust so with all the fungi.\r\n\r\nAll the puff-balls are edible but one of the most eatable is _the\r\ngiant_, which is found in August or September in pastures or other\r\ngrassy places. When right to eat it is grayish on the outside and pure\r\nwhite clear through. In size this giant varies from six or eight inches\r\nthrough to two feet. Specimens of ten pounds' weight are not rare, and\r\nthere is record of some twice that size. When yellow or brown inside,\r\nthe giant is past eating.\r\n\r\nThe _pear-shaped_ puff-ball is the commonest one. This is a sort of\r\ndirty brown colour outside, pure white inside. It is found on old\r\nwood or on the ground as early as July and as late as October. In size\r\nthe balls vary from thimble size to that of a big pear. They grow in\r\ncompanies, sometimes scores together.\r\n\r\nThe _brain_ puff-ball is larger than the pear-shaped. The top is\r\nwrinkled or corrugated, and grayish or reddish in colour.\r\n\r\n_Chanterelles._--Chanterelles are found in late summer in the woods\r\namongst moss where it is damp and cool. They are red or yellow and look\r\nas if you had put your thumb in the middle of the top and pushed it\r\ndown so that the network of gills appear on the outside. The name means\r\na little goblet, and the perfect ones are goblet-shaped. If you go\r\ncamping in the woods in summer you are almost sure to find chanterelles.\r\n\r\n_Meadow Mushrooms._--The wild meadow mushroom usually appears in\r\nlarge numbers after the autumn rains have renewed the pastures. They\r\nfrequently come up alongside of an old dried patch of cow manure. To\r\nmake myself familiar with this pink-gilled variety I visited a large\r\nmarket where they had them for sale in all stages, from the little\r\nround buttons to the big flat broilers which are turning brown. They\r\nare just right when the cap has spread so as to burst the delicate\r\nwhite veil which covers the gills. The flesh is white and the gills a\r\ndelicate pink. The skin peels off easily like that of a ripe peach.\r\nLook them over with great care when preparing for the table. The early\r\nworm which is on hand to get a first bite of everything sometimes\r\nhoneycombs the whole plant. The stems of young ones are tender at the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n_Inky Caps._--You never expect to gather your dinner from an ash heap?\r\nNeither did I; but in the edge of the woods nearest us the public used\r\nto be allowed to dump ashes. It is now overgrown with golden-rod, iron\r\nweed and various other coarse plants. A path leads through it. Last\r\nfall we discovered that the place was fairly swarming with _Coprinus\r\ncomatus_, the shaggy mane mushroom. This does not look like anything\r\nelse on land or sea and is delicious. Its relative, the inky cap is\r\njust as good to eat, but not so handsome. Both melt away into black\r\nink as they grow old. They should be cooked as soon as possible after\r\ngathering. We kept some over night once. Such a sight! They looked like\r\nblack corn smut.\r\n\r\nThe _Coprinæ_ push up in such tight clumps sometimes that their heads\r\nare all out of shape. They rise literally over night. Sometimes\r\none comes up singly and grows tall and perfect, a truly lovely\r\nobject, pure white, six inches tall, its shaggy head held high, its\r\nsilver-white gills delicate as tissue paper. A few hours later you will\r\nsee a ragged bit of pulp rapidly dissolving in a pool of black ink.\r\n\r\n_Oyster Mushrooms._--The oyster mushroom comes out like the shelf fungi\r\non decaying tree stumps or logs. They are ashy colour or dull white,\r\nsolid and rather tough, and vary in breadth from two to five inches. As\r\nto why they are called oyster mushrooms, opinions differ. The flavour\r\nis not oyster-like, though the flesh is about as tough as a boiled\r\noyster. The shape does suggest an oyster shell; perhaps that is the\r\nbest reason for the name. One edible relative of the oyster mushroom\r\ngrows usually on decaying elm stumps as late in the year as November.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do if you get interested in mushrooms is to get\r\nsome good illustrated book on them. The chances are that your State\r\nExperiment Station has issued a bulletin on the subject. If not you\r\ncan get those published by the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nor perhaps those issued by some neighbouring state. What you want is\r\ninformation on wild fungi, especially the edible ones, not directions\r\nabout growing the market varieties. When you write for bulletins state\r\njust what you are looking for. Pictures, especially photographs, are\r\nof the greatest use in identifying specimens. Compare the descriptions\r\nand pictures with your mushrooms and do not use them if there is any\r\nquestion in your mind as to what they are. The books mentioned in the\r\nappendix of this book have been of help to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSERVING NATURE'S CROPS\r\n\r\nThe harvesting of nature's crops is a most fascinating occupation. As\r\nboys and girls we do not ask why; we only know what fun it is. If the\r\ntime ever comes when you wish to forget that you are grown up, nothing\r\nwill help you like going into the woods, the fields, or the hedge-rows\r\nto help the birds and the little fur-coated animals harvest the crops\r\nof nuts or berries or other fruit that grow in nature's orchards. With\r\nyour sack of nuts or plums on your arm, or your pail full of berries,\r\nyou can easily forget that you live in a flat or work in an office or a\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nSome people think when they see how much over-ripe fruit is falling\r\nto the ground, and how much more there is than can ever be gathered\r\nby human hands, that nature is wasteful. Perhaps this is why these\r\nsame people and others who did not think at all, have been so very\r\nwasteful of our country's natural resources, and brought about such a\r\nreally alarming state of things in our forests. Those who do stop to\r\nthink will see that although she is lavish, nature is never wasteful.\r\nThe berries must decay in order that the seeds may germinate, and in\r\nmoulding they nourish the fungi which are just as important in nature's\r\neyes, so to speak, as the berries are. Nothing is _wasted_ in nature.\r\nOn the contrary, everything is _saved_ and is made over into some other\r\nform. Nothing stands still; transformation goes on continuously. What\r\nwas soil yesterday is fruit to-day and is built into our muscles and\r\nnerves and brains to-morrow.\r\n\r\nEvery boy or girl that helps to harvest nature's crops can do a little\r\nto assist in our great national work of preserving the country's\r\nnatural resources. Would you ruin a fine young tree just beginning a\r\nlife of usefulness? By mutilating it past recognition, you may add\r\na few nuts to your this year's store. But what an injustice you are\r\ndoing to the next generation of boys and girls. You are robbing them.\r\nI have heard men say: \"When I was a boy we used to bring home arbutus\r\nby the wagon load from Coy Glen. But it's hard to find any there now.\r\nIt must have winter-killed or blighted.\" My tongue burned to tell them\r\nthat they themselves were the blight that winter-killed the arbutus and\r\nrobbed me of my right to gather a few sprays. They had torn it up by\r\nthe roots in their greed to fill their wagons, and then they cut out\r\nall the trees, and the sunlight destroyed all the shade-loving things.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls of a more enlightened generation know better ways and\r\nwill not leave behind them a record of selfishness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE CREATION OF A NEW INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nI am glad to tell the methods by which I have developed a good business\r\nin collecting and growing California bulbs, as I believe my success\r\ncan be duplicated in other parts of the country--in fact, one man\r\nalready makes a good living by exploiting the wild flowers of the\r\nRocky Mountains, several people are exporting the cacti of our desert,\r\nand there are several nurseries in the southern Appalachians for the\r\ninteresting plants of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, when I was nine years old, my family moved to Ukiah Valley in\r\nnorth-western California, and there I have lived ever since. My early\r\nhome was a farm, and my first work to raise hops and a mortgage. My\r\neducation was such as the district school and an abundance of good\r\nreading could give me. At eighteen I began to teach school. I was\r\nalways a lover of nature and fond of wandering about the hills. In\r\nMendocino County in 1870 the country was just emerging from the cowboy\r\nera, and little attention was paid to vegetable gardening, while flower\r\ngardens were all but unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE LIFE WORK WAS DETERMINED\r\n\r\nThere was one notable exception to the indifference to flowers.\r\nAlexander MacNab, a Scotchman who had been forced by declining health\r\nto leave Glasgow, had found new vigour in California's mountains. The\r\nproperty which he had purchased for a stock range is one of the most\r\npicturesque in northern California, and there he built a modest but\r\nideal home. He sent everywhere for flowers, and I know of no place in\r\nthese later days where more flowers are well grown. He gave to his\r\nflowers not only money, but love and himself, and few gardeners were\r\nmore successful. I often visited there in my boyhood days and the\r\ninspiration that I received from this place and from another source\r\ndetermined my life work.\r\n\r\nI had a sister a few years older than myself who had been in the East\r\nfor some years and whose failing health forced her to return to\r\nCalifornia. She was a flower-lover and soon called upon me to begin a\r\ngarden on the bare hill where our very plain home stood. It was a work\r\nof love, for all of the new soil was carried in buckets, and the water\r\nwhich our hot climate made necessary was carried from a well, but it\r\nwas a great success. My Scotch friend was most liberal with both plants\r\nand instruction, and between the two my bent was well fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nIt was through Mr. MacNab that I got started in the collection of\r\nnative plants. Woolson and Company, then of Passaic, N. J., were the\r\nfirst American firm to take up the culture of our native American\r\nplants as a specialty. They wrote to Mr. MacNab, asking him to secure\r\nthe native plants and offering to pay for them in eastern grown plants.\r\nMy love for flowers had interested me in botany, and it was quite\r\nnatural that the letter should be turned over to me. In my first letter\r\nto Woolson I sent a pressed flower of _Colochortus pulchellus_ and\r\nreceived in return an order for one hundred bulbs, which they said they\r\nwould pay for in cash. This order was filled and it was the beginning\r\nof my bulb business.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was to earn money to buy plants with, but before long I\r\nsaw that a small business might be built up.\r\n\r\nMy progress as a collector went hand in hand with my education in\r\nbotany. My method was this: First to find something of sufficient\r\nbeauty to make it probable that it would be wanted; next, to find its\r\nname, and then to offer it to some one of the very few firms then\r\ninterested in such things.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first stage in the development of a new industry, but the\r\nlatter was no less important, for it involved knowing the plant at\r\nevery stage of its growth, finding when it could best be handled, and\r\nhow best packed for shipment. Almost from the beginning I tried to grow\r\nthe native plants, and botanical study, collection, and cultivation\r\nhave gone hand in hand since.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF COLLECTING\r\n\r\nEvery year I took longer trips. I went alone, with the lightest of\r\ncamping outfits, slept on the ground, and penetrated the wildest\r\nregions, learning where the desirable flowers grew, and collecting\r\nthose in demand, at the same time studying the general flora. When I\r\nhad learned the flora of a region, I tried to train some resident as\r\na permanent collector, for not all of these long trips could be made\r\nevery year. My horizon fast widened, and through friends, by letters\r\nto others, and often by the migration of men whom I had trained, new\r\nfields were opened, and later I had men who had been trained under me\r\nto send to distant points.\r\n\r\nBefore I began to collect, others had been in the field, but they were\r\nprincipally wandering botanists who seldom collected over the same\r\nground for two years in sequence. Their collections were of stuff of\r\nall grades, often made at the wrong season, and there was no demand\r\nexcept from a few special lists. At first I shared their faults, but\r\nafter a few years I saw the necessity of making a reputation for\r\nreliability, for thoroughly learning the art of packing, and for such\r\ngrading as would insure uniform quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHING A NURSERY BUSINESS\r\n\r\nAs time went on, collection became less important and culture the\r\ncentral feature of my work.\r\n\r\nMy first garden was at the farm home; later I spent much time and money\r\nin experiments in a reclaimed lake bed near Ukiah, still later at my\r\nUkiah home, and since 1897 in the mountains about eight miles east of\r\nUkiah. Each experiment had its value. No one had grown Californian\r\nbulbs in California, and everything had to be learned experimentally.\r\nI now have two nurseries. One of them is at Lyons Valley, a lovely\r\nspot in the highest part of that branch of the Coast Range which I\r\nfound six years ago was specially adapted to lily culture. About three\r\nquarters of a mile away, at \"The Terraces,\" nature has provided endless\r\nvariations of soil, climate, moisture, sun, and shade. Here I grow a\r\ngreat variety of bulbs.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 I sold about seven thousand plants of all sorts; in 1888,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand, and the difference was on business\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n                                                             CARL PURDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nRAISING DOMESTIC ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING COLTS\r\n\r\nEvery farm boy I ever knew was ambitious to own horses. Before my\r\neldest brother was twelve he had traded pigs with our father for\r\ncalves, then heifers for a horse, and his favourite air castles were\r\ngreat luxurious barns inhabited by blooded horses of his own raising.\r\n\r\nIf your colt's mother is dutiful, and they mostly are, the youngster\r\nwill have plenty to eat for the first few weeks. Petting is a good\r\nthing for little colts; never a cuff nor a harsh word. Their confidence\r\nwon, their education is begun. While still dependent on the mother for\r\nmilk the young colt begins to nibble hay from the manger, and gets a\r\ntaste of the oats in the feed box, too, and finds them good. Oats and\r\nclover hay, a little bran and shorts, a run in the pasture every fine\r\nday all winter, will usually keep the colt growing and healthy. A warm\r\nstable with plenty of dry bedding, preferably in a stall with another\r\ncolt, is necessary at night.\r\n\r\nColts need a plentiful supply of cool, clean water in summer, but in\r\nwinter, water should be heated just enough to take off the chill. It is\r\nbad for a colt to drink at meal-time. (That sounds like a rule for boys\r\nand girls.) A chunk of rock salt handy for colts to lick at helps keep\r\nthe appetite normal.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary farm colt at three or four months old is worth only thirty\r\nor forty dollars. Two years later, with the right kind of care and\r\nteaching, the same colt will bring four times that price. What other\r\nfarm crop will do as much?\r\n\r\nThe mother of a baby colt once died on our farm. My father felt very\r\nbadly over it; losing the old mare was misfortune enough, but the colt\r\nwas a noble-looking little fellow, highly bred. We girls had been\r\nfoster-mothers to almost everything; cats, pups, and pigs were easy,\r\nand calves. But what of a colt? \"Let's try if we can't raise him on the\r\nbottle,\" said our mother. The experiments we tried with that colt were\r\nmany. We gave him \"half and half\" at first--a cup full of milk to one\r\nof water. Our small cousin had once been fed on mare's milk, much to\r\nour disgust, but it gave us ideas for our colt. Mother read somewhere\r\nthat cow's milk was not so sweet, but was richer than mare's milk. So\r\nwe patched our bits of hearsay together and made up our colt's ration\r\nabout like this:\r\n\r\nFirst week: half sweet milk, half water, a teaspoonful of sugar to each\r\npint, ten times a day--always warm--last feeding at ten P. M.--not\r\nvery much at a time. Second and third weeks less water, six feedings a\r\nday, warm and sweet as before. Fourth to tenth week: increase quantity\r\ngradually, give warm--not very rich--milk three times a day. We gave\r\nhim a bottle at first with a nipple made of a goose-quill wrapped each\r\ntime with clean, soft rags. Everything about his food had to be kept\r\nsweet. We scalded the bottle and the quill and washed them in water and\r\nbaking soda, just as mother said. Then we taught him to drink from a\r\npail. He followed us about like a dog and was very playful and frisky.\r\nWe fed him a little hay and oats and grass when he was old enough. My\r\nlittle sister wanted us to give him less milk so that he would grow up\r\ninto a pony, but when he begged for food, she was the first to go for\r\nhis bottle. He grew up and developed just like any horse and father\r\nsaid he was the easiest two-year-old he ever had to teach to work. He\r\npaid us seventy-five dollars for the colt when he was eight months old\r\nand ready to shift for himself with the other colts.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING SHEEP\r\n\r\nEvery boy on the farm ought to have his own particular hobby in the\r\nline of stock. It is far easier to keep account of your own if they are\r\nentirely different from the animals raised by the other members of the\r\nfamily. An account should be kept with the animals, to learn whether\r\nthey pay or not. It is only by this business-like method that the young\r\nfarmer, or the older one for that matter, can know whether his animals\r\nare visitors or boarders.\r\n\r\nIf the mother keeps poultry, the boys pigs, and the father raises\r\nhorses and cows, then why should not the girls raise sheep? There is\r\nroom on every fair-sized farm for a flock. There is nothing about the\r\ncare of sheep that a strong, healthy girl may not do if she is not\r\nneeded to help with housework. Her father will teach and advise her.\r\nTending sheep is far more healthful occupation and more remunerative\r\nthan embroidering sofa pillows or knitting \"fancy work.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever undertakes the sheep raising must know first some of the needs\r\nof his favourites. They are grazers. They will glean a good living in\r\nstubble fields and crop grass in pastures where cows would starve; they\r\nwill bite the weeds in the fence corners down to the quick nor leave\r\none stalk to blossom or set seed. They are among the best and cheapest\r\nof lawn-mowers, enriching the ground they feed over. They are easy to\r\ncare for, as they can take care of themselves most of the year. What a\r\njoy it is to take a quiet walk over the hills of a Sunday morning to\r\nsalt the sheep! They are trustful, playful, docile creatures, and their\r\npresence undeniably adds to the picture of content and comfort that\r\nevery homestead should present.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that sheep will keep fat on good pasture with plenty\r\nof water and a semi-weekly supply of salt, it is not to be supposed\r\nthat they can pick up a living the whole year round in a cold climate.\r\nThey do not need stuffing in cold weather, but they do need plenty of\r\ngood hay in early winter and nourishing food like bran, oats, barley,\r\nand clover hay toward spring. Alfalfa is ideal, but many people\r\nsucceed with sheep who fail on alfalfa. Sheep will over-feed if not\r\nrestrained. They should have exercise and fresh air in plenty all\r\nwinter. They should go out every day to pasture, except during storms,\r\nuntil snow covers the ground.\r\n\r\nEwes fed but not over-fed over winter and sheltered under some kind\r\nof rain-proof roof will be strong and healthy mothers. A new-born\r\nlamb is about as weak and wobbly and inefficient as a human baby. The\r\nweakest ones seem bent on dying, but a little coddling and care will\r\nput them on their feet. They should be taught how to take nourishment\r\nand whoever takes this in hand should use patience and insist that the\r\nlesson be learned. I have known of many a good shepherd who sat up late\r\nand got up early and visited the sheep at midnight in lambing time and\r\nso saved all his lambs. There is something so appealing about a lamb\r\nthat no owner would like to remember that he slept comfortably through\r\na stormy night while a new-born lamb starved in the presence of plenty\r\nor was chilled past help while its mother could only bleat helplessly\r\nfor the slothful shepherd.\r\n\r\nLambs should not follow their mothers to pasture until the grass is\r\ngrown enough to be really long and nourishing. They should be out in\r\nthe barnyard on warm, sunny days, and not weaned until near six months\r\nold. After August they will fatten on clover pasture and be ready for\r\nmarket before Christmas.\r\n\r\nSheep are sheared in spring, about April first, but this depends on\r\nthe climate. Most farm crops are fall or winter affairs. Like maple\r\nsirup, wool is a spring cash crop, which is a great convenience. An\r\neight-pound fleece is worth nearly half as much as the sheep it grew\r\non, and the lambs will soon be worth as much as their mothers. So we\r\nhave a double chance to make good in sheep raising.\r\n\r\nSheep are so hardy, so harmless, and so easily managed that the only\r\nwonder is that any farm is without a flock. Men who know say that the\r\nfarm dog is to blame for this. How about the farm dog, boys and girls?\r\nHonestly, now, is your dog worth his keep? No matter how much better\r\nhe is than the neighbours' dog. How about your dog? You like him, of\r\ncourse, but is he a loafing, worthless, sneaking, sheep-killing dog?\r\nLook between his teeth before you deny that he is a sheep-killer.\r\nAre you a good citizen if you let such a dog run at large? If you\r\nraise sheep you will need a dog, and remember that a good collie will\r\nprotect your sheep from all the roving, bloodthirsty dogs in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Julian A. Dimock. \"Big Boy Blue\" Looks\r\nAfter the Sheep]\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING GOATS\r\n\r\nBoys, are you really serious about making some money? Do you live on\r\na farm where the hills are too steep to plow and the only crop that\r\namounts to anything is the crop of stones? Are those steep hills\r\ncovered with brush and good-for-nothing trees that look too hopeless?\r\nDon't grind your teeth and say \"There's no chance here. I'm going to\r\nbuy a ticket for the city.\" Glance at the heading on this page and\r\ndon't smile derisively nor turn on to some new chapter.\r\n\r\n\"Goats! Humph!\"\r\n\r\nIf you never heard of anybody making anything out of goats, here's your\r\nchance to hear something new. People can and do make money out of goats\r\nand so can you. Why, it is too easy!\r\n\r\nHere, read these facts about goats:\r\n\r\nGoats _prefer_ rough, rocky, wild, and hilly land.\r\n\r\nGoats _always thrive_ if allowed considerable range.\r\n\r\nHilly, _bushy_ land is _best_ for goats.\r\n\r\nThe feed of _one_ cow will keep _twelve_ goats.\r\n\r\n_Temperature_ need not be considered. Goats thrive where temperatures\r\nare _extreme_.\r\n\r\nThe Angora goat _fleece_ is cut annually and is _very valuable_. We\r\nimport over one million pounds a year. Skins of common goats are in\r\n_great demand_ for leather. We imported sixteen million dollars' worth\r\nin 1898 and more every year since.\r\n\r\n_Goat manure_ is as valuable as that of sheep.\r\n\r\nAngora _venison_ cannot be told from lamb.\r\n\r\nGoats _scorn_ to eat fresh grass if _coarse weeds_ like wild carrot,\r\nmullein, dock, etc., are in sight.\r\n\r\n_Every part_ of a goat is _salable_. Fleece, milk, cheese, skin, flesh,\r\ntallow, bones, hoofs, horns, and manure.\r\n\r\nGoats _improve land_. They are \"lifelong scavengers,\" and can put land\r\ncovered with useless underbrush into shape for pasture more cheaply and\r\nmore quickly than dynamite.\r\n\r\nA herd of _common goats_ can be built up in _a few years_. They breed\r\nat one year and usually have twins.\r\n\r\nGoats are _hardy_; less subject to disease than sheep.\r\n\r\nA good goat is a _money-maker_.\r\n\r\nThese statements are quoted directly from the writings of men and women\r\nof experience. They have no goats to sell, so you can take their word.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for successful goat raising are few and easy to\r\nprovide. They are these:\r\n\r\n(1) _Space._--Goats do not take kindly to herding nor to small fields.\r\nIf they have only a small enclosure they are likely spend more time\r\ntrying to get at what is outside than in browsing. To meet a wire fence\r\nevery few steps makes a goat restive.\r\n\r\n(2) _Housing._--Goats must be kept dry overhead and under foot. The\r\nshelter for goats should be high and dry. They will not thrive in wet,\r\nmarshy land, nor keep well if their shed is muddy. They dislike filth\r\nand will not stand in it nor touch soiled food. They prefer to sleep\r\non the roof of the barn, you know, but if a clean, dry bed in an airy\r\nplace is provided they will not roost so high.\r\n\r\n(3) _Water._--Plenty of clean fresh water should always be available.\r\n\r\nIf you can supply these three essentials, you are ready to raise goats.\r\n\r\nThere are two well-marked lines of business in goat raising. Which\r\nshall you follow?\r\n\r\nAngoras are raised for their fleece; common goats either for leather or\r\nfor milk. Angoras are not much good for milk and their skins are not\r\nso fine nor durable as those of common goats. The Angora is free from\r\nthe offensive odour of common male goats. The greatest demand for goat\r\nproducts in our markets to-day is for Angora fleece and for common goat\r\nskins. The other products, like flesh, hoof, bones and horns, tallow,\r\ncheese, milk, and manure, can easily be marketed and should pay most of\r\nthe expenses. The main products should be clear profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING UP A HERD\r\n\r\nThere is a slow way and a quick way to build up a herd of goats. As\r\nusual the slow way requires less capital. If you have but a few dollars\r\nyou will have to begin with cheap goats, but to keep a poor goat is\r\npoor business. You can buy good, common goats for one dollar and a\r\nhalf or two dollars each and with time and patience build up from them\r\na herd of Angoras by crossing. If capital is easier to command than\r\nyears of time, you will begin with good Angora does which cost from\r\neight dollars upward. If you begin with common ones, choose white,\r\nshort-haired individuals. Keep only the best does in your herd for\r\nbreeders; you will soon learn how to judge them by the quality of their\r\nfleece and the price it brings you per pound. In five or six years it\r\nis possible to build up a herd of fine mohair producers from common\r\ngoats.\r\n\r\nThe hair grows coarser as the goat passes six years of age, so it does\r\nnot pay to keep one too long. Buy young does. A goat's teeth tell its\r\nage up to the fourth year. If all the eight teeth are full-sized the\r\ngoat is certainly four to five years old, it may be more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF KIDS\r\n\r\nA young kid is not a very sturdy youngster. Good care should be given\r\nboth doe and kid at this time. A warm shelter should be provided. May\r\nis the best month for kids to come, in the North. Extra feeding should\r\nbe given the doe and plenty of water. If possible each doe with her kid\r\nshould have a separate stall or pen so that the doe will know her own\r\nyoung one. If you can arrange that each pen in the kid stable can have\r\nan outdoor entrance the mother can come and go at will. A board a foot\r\nto eighteen inches high across this entrance will keep the kid from\r\nfollowing his mother. When about six weeks old the kid will jump this\r\nboard. By this token you will know that he is strong enough to jump\r\nabout over the stones wherever his mother leads him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD OF GOATS\r\n\r\nThe comic papers may be right about some things, but they are wrong\r\nabout goats. A diet of newspapers and tin cans will not keep a\r\ngoat healthy nor produce a salable fleece of fine mohair. Angoras\r\nlike common goats are browsers, not grazers like sheep. They eat\r\ncoarse vegetation such as weedy growths and the twigs and leaves of\r\nunderbrush, rather than grass. Besides this, particularly in winter,\r\nthey should have other food. Leaves, table scraps like potato and fruit\r\nparings, turnips and other roots, and cabbage are all acceptable if\r\nclean. Parings and roots should be washed; if you expect goats to eat\r\nswill you deserve to be disappointed. Dirty carrots, rotten apples,\r\nsour or mouldy refuse do not tempt a self-respecting pig; much less\r\nan Angora. Oats in the sheaf are very good fodder for them. Grain is\r\nnot required if clover hay, alfalfa, or cowpea stubble is plentiful.\r\nToo much grain makes a lazy goat and a lazy goat will not produce a\r\nhandsome fleece. Bran may be fed for a change, and a little cotton seed\r\nor corn may be given, but sparingly. Leaves or other coarse food should\r\nbe given plentifully at night, as Angoras relish a midnight lunch\r\nbeside their three square meals a day.\r\n\r\nA supply of rock salt should be kept where goats can get it whenever\r\nthey want it. If it is given only at long intervals they may\r\nover-indulge. Water should be warmed slightly in winter if practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELTER AND ENCLOSURE\r\n\r\nHardy as they are, goats cannot stand exposure to storms. They abhor\r\nwet. Cold rain or sleet storms are really dangerous to their health.\r\nGoats will go the long way round every time rather than get into mud.\r\nMud is very bad for the fleece, too. Buyers refuse to pay for dirt.\r\n\r\nGoat shelters should be dry, but they need not be tight except\r\noverhead. In fact many goats die of suffocation when huddled in close\r\nquarters. If the roof is just high enough from the floor for goats to\r\ngo under, it can be open all round except perhaps on the side where the\r\nprevailing wind and storms would beat in.\r\n\r\nNo other animals should be quartered with goats. Experience shows this.\r\n\r\nGoats prefer hard beds. Chaff or straw enough to absorb the liquid\r\nmanure is all that should be put on the floor. Trees are the best shade\r\nfrom the hot sun, but if none are growing in the goats' pasture other\r\nshelter should be provided.\r\n\r\nIt is true that goats thrive best when unconfined. But this does not\r\nmean that your goats should be allowed to range on other people's\r\ndomains. They are a very real nuisance in orchards and gardens, and\r\nif your place is small it is no place for goats. A fence need not be\r\nvery high to restrain a flock of goats. They are climbers and once\r\nin a while there is one who would take a prize for the \"high jump.\"\r\nOrdinarily a fence three and a half feet high is all that is necessary.\r\nBoards, rails, or wire will make a good goat fence. It should go close\r\nto the ground to prevent crawling under. If wire is used, take care\r\nthat the mesh is too small for a goat's head.\r\n\r\nYou must take your market's demands into consideration when deciding\r\nwhether to breed Angoras or common goats. An Angora fleece weighs from\r\nfour to eight pounds. This can be cut every year for ten or twelve\r\nyears. The common goat's skin is valuable, but he has only one! This\r\nmakes the Angora look like the best business proposition, although\r\nrequiring more capital to start, as the care required is about the same\r\nand the value of by-products practically equal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON GOAT\r\n\r\nTwo arguments may be brought forward in favour of the common goat. In\r\nthe first place, the herd increases much faster as the Angora doe\r\nusually has only one kid, while twins are the rule with common goats.\r\nThere is a decidedly growing demand for goats' milk near large cities,\r\nespecially for hospitals. We all know how commonly goats' milk is\r\nused in foreign countries. We Americans have a rather silly prejudice\r\nagainst it, but we will get over this when we realize how often goats'\r\nmilk saves the lives of babies and invalids. The following statements\r\nare vouched for by physicians and others of experience:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Helen W. Cooke. Feeding the Goats]\r\n\r\nGoats' milk is more easily digested than cows' milk.\r\n\r\nAnalysis shows goats' milk has a marked similarity to human mothers'\r\nmilk and is more readily assimilated by infants.\r\n\r\nGoats' milk is generally claimed to be free at all times from germs of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nCannot be told from cow's milk by taste.\r\n\r\nExcellent for coffee and in cooking.\r\n\r\nThe goat is claimed by its friends to be greatly the superior of the\r\ncow for milk, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe goat is naturally cleanly.\r\n\r\nThe goat is easy to keep clean because of her small size. Goats can be\r\nand are put into tubs and scrubbed and sterilized when being used as\r\nfoster-mothers in baby hospitals. But no such treatment is possible\r\nwith a cow.\r\n\r\nA goat can easily be taken from place to place with a family. A cow\r\ncould not be transported without great expense.\r\n\r\nGoats eat far less than cows. Eight milch goats can be kept on the food\r\nof one milch cow. The same quality of food should be furnished.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a great future in America for the milch goat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY ACRES REDEEMED: THE STORY OF A SATISFACTORY EXPERIMENT WITH\r\nGOATS IN NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\nIn January, 1902, I bought seventy-five Angoras, as I had about twenty\r\nacres of brush land that I wanted to reclaim. I kept the goats in sheds\r\nuntil May. I had to put up a wire fence to keep them from visiting my\r\nneighbours, and in early May turned them into the first section, about\r\none half of the piece. I built a shed for them to stay in nights and\r\nduring rains.\r\n\r\nThe work they did was marvellous. In less than a month this section had\r\nthe appearance of having been struck by a cyclone, and it was evident\r\nthat the goats would soon require more territory. Consequently I wired\r\nthe other section of this twenty-acre piece, and when finished allowed\r\nthem the range of the other piece, to which they marched in military\r\nprecision daily, returning to the shed at night or during the approach\r\nof rain, which they seemed to foretell as accurately as a barometer.\r\nIt was not long before it developed that they would require fresher\r\nfields or I must reduce my flock, as this ground was all that I had of\r\nthat kind. Consequently I sold all but twenty-five, retaining twelve\r\nregistered does, twelve kids, and one buck. For the does I paid ten\r\ndollars each, and my buck, which was a kid, cost twenty-five dollars.\r\nI had some grades that I sold at eight dollars and eight dollars and\r\ntwenty-five cents each, and also some wether kids that I sold at five\r\ndollars each. I have this same flock now, with the addition of ten kids\r\nborn this spring from these twelve does, which had twelve kids, two\r\nhaving died, leaving thirty-five now in the field.\r\n\r\nDuring the past winter I have handled more than six hundred that were\r\nsent here from the West. The test that I was anxiously watching for\r\nat the advent of spring was to see the effect of their work done last\r\nseason, and I must say I am very agreeably surprised. In the first lot\r\nfenced there is scarcely a brush left, no briers, and not even Canada\r\nthistles. The entire field between the rocks came out this spring with\r\nbeautiful, thick, green, grassy foliage, mostly white clover. On the\r\nother lot, part of the brush tried hard to show its tenacity of life\r\nby coming out with green leaves, but at this writing the shrubs have\r\nfallen prey to the devouring Angora, and green grass is coming out\r\nin about all the ground that they have trod. This alone to me is a\r\nsatisfactory commercial experience.\r\n\r\n                                                          W. O. CORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING CALVES\r\n\r\nFeeding the calves is always the boy's job or the girl's. Usually\r\nthe milk is prepared by their mother, but the responsibility for the\r\ncalves' welfare is left to the youngsters. If you look upon calf\r\nfeeding as nothing but a chore to get over with as soon as possible,\r\nyou get very little fun out of it. But if you see in those calves the\r\nbeginning of your own fortune or the foundation of your college fund\r\nthey look different. Whether the calves are yours or your father's,\r\nthey are living creatures, capable of appreciating proper care and\r\nrepaying it. They are just as capable of showing neglect.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to feed the calves, make a study of calf nature,\r\nknow what kind of animals you want to make of them, find out how to\r\naccomplish your purpose, and then keep a straight course. Find out\r\nfirst the parentage of the calf. Then inquire if it is to be a beef\r\nanimal or a dairy cow. Knowing its past and its future you can provide\r\nwisely for the present.\r\n\r\nA new-born calf should stay with the mother from twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours. The fluid she gives first is not milk, but is just what the calf\r\nneeds to prepare its digestive organs for milk. If left longer with the\r\nmother it will be more bother to train. The calf should be fed sweet,\r\nwhole milk for two weeks. If put immediately onto a diet of skim-milk,\r\nindigestion is likely to result, and the calf gets a setback from which\r\nit may never recover.\r\n\r\nWhen a young calf is taken from its mother, it knows nothing about\r\ndrinking. The best practice is to let it fast for from twelve to\r\ntwenty-four hours till it gets good and hungry. It is then in a state\r\nof mind to learn anything rather than go without any longer. [They\r\ntreat human babies the same way if need be.] If started right, a young\r\ncalf learns to drink in a day or two. Holding the pail with one to two\r\nquarts of warm, fresh, whole milk in your left hand, stand beside the\r\ncalf and put your right hand over its nose. Insert two fingers into\r\nits mouth. Did you ever feel anything so funny? The calf will suck\r\nyour fingers hungrily. Gently push its nose down into the warm milk\r\nwith your fingers still in its mouth. After a while gently pull out\r\none finger. If he misses it put it back and later try again. In a few\r\nlessons the calf will drink readily. Patience and kindness must be\r\nexercised if one little scamp proves dull. A calf that gets a slap for\r\nnot drinking will come to think that the two disagreeable things always\r\ncome together and his education and his growth will be delayed.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten to twelve days the calf should have about five quarts\r\nof milk a day, divided into three feedings. This should be warmed to\r\nblood heat, ninety-five to a hundred degrees Fahr. At two weeks you\r\ncan begin to substitute skim-milk. A half-pint a day at first is about\r\nright. Watch the effect on the calf. Increase the quantity gradually,\r\nuntil at a month or six weeks old the calf is getting seven to eight\r\nquarts per day of skim-milk, always warm and perfectly sweet.\r\n\r\nThe worst disease of calf-hood is scours, and this disease is caused by\r\nfeeding cold, unclean, or sour milk. I'd be ashamed to have a calf of\r\nmine sick with the scours! To cure it, add lime-water to the milk or\r\nmix a teaspoonful of dried blood in a small amount of water, then stir\r\ninto the milk. Or an ounce of wheat bran or kaffir corn meal stirred\r\ninto the milk will be helpful. Some recommend oat or corn meal fed dry,\r\nor a little linseed meal mixed in a little water and then stirred into\r\nthe milk.\r\n\r\nIf your calves are all heifers to be added to the dairy herd, you do\r\nnot want them to lay on great amounts of fat, but to grow strong and be\r\nable to digest great amounts of hay. If they are to be beef, they need\r\nmore fat. Grain is fattening, especially corn. Begin to feed hay as\r\nsoon as the calf will take it. Clean, dry clover is best, but any good\r\nhay will help prepare their stomachs for the work which is expected of\r\nthem later. Milk and hay are best for growing calves. Grain, oil-meal,\r\nand pasture furnish variety.\r\n\r\nHave you seen a wild-eyed cow being literally dragged behind a wagon,\r\nscared past endurance and behaving like a savage creature? There is not\r\nthe slightest excuse for that sort of thing. What fun it is to slip a\r\nhalter on a calf to-day and let him get accustomed to it; to-morrow\r\nlead him about a little with coaxing. In a few days he will lead like\r\nan old horse. He will learn to expect only kindness from his feeder\r\nand trainer. It would be well to accustom the calves to the presence\r\nof your dog, too. There are men who think a frightened animal is a\r\nhumourous sight. But such a man is \"no gentleman\" and I certainly would\r\nnever think of trusting him to drive my horses, or milk my cows, or\r\neven feed my pigs.\r\n\r\nOur calves were kept in an old orchard, convenient to the house, with\r\ngood pasture, plenty of sun and shade, and a suitable fence. A shed for\r\nwet weather is essential, for a clean, dry bed must be provided. Calves\r\nhave no way of cleaning themselves, therefore they must not be allowed\r\nto get dirty.\r\n\r\nMilk should be fed until the calves are four months old, and may be\r\ncontinued longer. After the first few weeks, when they have begun to\r\ntake some hay and grass, the milk may be given in two feedings. Water\r\nshould be given freely especially in hot weather. If your pasture has\r\na clear running brook, your calves are in luck and so are you, for\r\ncarrying water for a bunch of calves is no joke. A garden hose or a\r\nseries of v-shaped troughs from pump to pen saves a lot of time and\r\nbackache.\r\n\r\nA calf whose mother has a record for milk rich in butter fat and a sire\r\nof good family has in it the possibilities of a prize-winner. Whether\r\nshe will earn seventy-seven cents a year over and above her keep, like\r\nthose one thousand and twenty poor cows that Illinois boys and girls\r\nknow about, or thirty dollars a year, like the twenty-five good cows,\r\ndepends very much on the care she gets. No amount of care given to a\r\ncow will make up for neglect to the calf. There's a big responsibility\r\non the boys and girls of the farms, for calf feeding is their job.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF TWO BOYS AND A COW\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the suburban home might be a money-making\r\ninvestment would strike the average suburbanite as ridiculous. But a\r\nfew moments of careful calculation may put preconceived notions to\r\nflight and show how considerable money may be made--or saved, which is\r\nquite as important.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a family, which included two boys of eleven and thirteen\r\nyears, took a house in the outskirts of a good-sized town, about thirty\r\nminutes' ride from the city. The father was a buyer for an importing\r\nhouse, and absent from home for several months of each year. His salary\r\nwas large, as such salaries go, but there were seven children to be\r\nraised and educated, several of them with marked abilities that needed\r\nthe very best possible instruction to bring them to their highest\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe boys spent one summer vacation at the country house of an old\r\nfriend of the family and got ideas. They talked them over, went back to\r\ntheir friend for counsel, then turned their batteries on their parents\r\nto gain their consent to an important new enterprise.\r\n\r\nAttached to the house was about an acre of ground, three fourths of\r\nwhich was old pasture grown to weeds and a tangle of brier bushes.\r\n\r\nBy promising to work for a farmer during the coming vacation the\r\nboys arranged to have the field, which they cleared and made ready,\r\nploughed, harrowed, and marked in the most thorough fashion.\r\n\r\nThey planted it with the best variety of mid-season sweet corn. The\r\nfarmer cultivated it, and the boys hoed it and kept it in almost\r\nperfect condition.\r\n\r\nThe season was very dry, but they laid a hose so as to start a stream\r\nof water into the lines between the rows of corn; then with a good pump\r\nthey filled the trenches they had dug and completely irrigated the\r\nentire field.\r\n\r\nThe crop was a great success. The boys picked and sold at retail prices\r\nto private customers twelve hundred dozen ears of the finest corn\r\nraised in that section. As it averaged twenty cents a dozen, it footed\r\nup the very comfortable sum of two hundred and forty dollars with small\r\nears and left-overs quite sufficient for the use of the family.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks from the first picking the stalks were cut and set up to cure\r\nfor the cow that was really the object of their endeavour.\r\n\r\nThe friend of the family selected the cow. She was a fine, fresh, young\r\nJersey and Alderney cross--a high-grade animal, good for quality as\r\nwell as quantity of milk and cream.\r\n\r\nThere was small, well-built barn on the place, and here the cow was\r\nstabled. Cleanliness was the first, last, and intermediate law in and\r\nabout the place. The boys had clothes expressly for barn wear and white\r\naprons with long sleeves to put on when milking.\r\n\r\nSuch unusual attention to details attracted customers until the demand\r\nwent far ahead of the supply.\r\n\r\nFor the first six months the cow gave, on an average, sixteen quarts a\r\nday, fourteen of which were sold to persons who came for it, thereby\r\nsaving all trouble and cost of delivery.

STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING PIGS\r\n\r\nWhen I was nine years old I laid the foundation of my college fund. My\r\ngrandmother had a flock of twenty or thirty geese which were kept for\r\nthe pillows and feather beds they filled. Great was my delight when\r\ngrandma told me that she would give me a pig if I would help her pick\r\nthe geese. Helping her would have been reward enough, for I was a great\r\ngrandma girl, but the ambition of my childhood was to own a pig. Did\r\nnot my elder brother now own a beautiful mare and colt, and had he not\r\nstarted with a pig?\r\n\r\nWednesday was the day set for plucking the geese and all my leisure on\r\nMonday and Tuesday was spent in building a pen. Plenty of material from\r\nwhich to construct this edifice was found about the place. I wisely\r\nlocated it at the back of the henhouse which left me only three sides\r\nto build. One corner was roofed with the best boards I could find, for\r\nI didn't wish my precious pig to suffer from sunstroke or have his bed\r\ntransformed into a mud-hole when it rained.\r\n\r\nWhen the geese were picked to the last feather they could spare, I\r\nwent with grandmother to select my pig from the litter of sucklings\r\nnow ready to begin taking their food from the trough. She generously\r\nallowed me my choice, and if I did not get the pick of the bunch it was\r\nnot her fault. I wonder how a girl of nine succeeded in transporting\r\na lusty pig the three quarters of a mile between grandmother's house\r\nand ours. I should not like to undertake it now, but my confidence in\r\nmy ability to do what I wanted done in those days was unlimited. A\r\npiece of rope, a stout cudgel, a pair of strong, young arms, and a high\r\ndisregard of appearances sustained me. I got my treasure home and into\r\nhis pen--no mean triumph even as viewed by my elder brother who had\r\npassed by the pig stage and even the calf stage and entered into the\r\nexalted realm of horse ownership.\r\n\r\nMy father was not the \"your shoat, my hog\" kind of a father. There came\r\na time when he used to say that the girls owned all the cattle and the\r\nboys all the horses on the farm. When my pig grew up, I traded it to my\r\nfather for a fine calf. This calf was the nucleus of my \"herd,\" for I\r\nnever owned a horse. All through my college course when I needed money,\r\nI used to write to father to sell \"Rowena\" or \"Corinne\" or \"Natty\r\nBumpo.\" (We named our calves after the people we read about.) There\r\nwas always a buyer ready at hand and the price paid was strictly in\r\naccord with the market quotations. The cow which bought my graduation\r\ncap and gown was the last of her race, \"Betsy Bobbett,\" one of the\r\ngreat-great-granddaughters of the calf for which I traded that original\r\npig.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny or doubt that there is profit in pig raising. Pork\r\n\"on the hoof\" is ten cents a pound even as I write these words, with\r\nprospects good for going higher. A profit of one hundred per cent. is\r\nrecorded by growers when the price is only six cents a pound.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of poultry, hogs bring the quickest returns for\r\ninvestment of any live stock. It is poor economy to keep any animal\r\nwhich cannot pay its board, except for sentiment, and few people keep\r\npigs on that account. If I were beginning again I should not trade my\r\npig for a calf but should raise pigs.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a mother for my family of hogs I should care more about\r\nher individual character than about her breed. A good brood sow\r\nought to have a good disposition, which means a good digestion, and\r\nrespond quickly to kindness. Nervous, irritable sows often develop\r\nvicious habits. A short, broad face, a wide space between the eyes,\r\na deep chest, broad back, and large hams with rather short legs are\r\nall considered good points. A good-natured, healthy pig has a bright,\r\nfriendly manner when accosted and a look of shrewd though guileless\r\ninterest in his master.\r\n\r\n\"Dirty as a pig\" is a slander on the pig and a censure on its owner.\r\nPigs and goats are more particular about their beds than either horses\r\nor cows. Success with porkers is spelt _c-l-e-a-n-l-i-n-e-s-s_. They\r\nlike to wallow in the edge of a sluggish stream on a warm day. Well,\r\nso do you. Mud is not dirty unless mixed with foul manure and decaying\r\nvegetable matter.\r\n\r\nAll feeding troughs, floors, and beds should be thoroughly scraped,\r\nswept, and dried if the pigs are to be healthy, happy, and comfortable.\r\nUnder no other conditions does keeping pigs pay.\r\n\r\nYou will be very fortunate if your young sow's first litter numbers\r\nten or a dozen lively youngsters. Six or eight will not be bad if she\r\nraises them all, and with care she ought to. Improper care and feeding\r\nbefore the pigs come are usually responsible for any cannibalistic\r\nhabits developed by the sow. Corn alone is not a good ration except\r\nfor fattening. Used with wheat, middlings, bran, and ground oats, with\r\nplenty of clover or alfalfa hay, corn is all right. The sow should be\r\nput into a pen by herself before farrowing time. The best bedding is\r\nclean wheat or rye straw, which should not be left until it is wet and\r\nfilthy. Sprinkle air-slaked lime in the sleeping pen under the fresh\r\nbedding. A sick pig means a neglectful owner.\r\n\r\nPigs ought to grow fast and without any check. At six months old they\r\nshould weigh two hundred pounds, an average gain you see, of over a\r\npound a day. With a good, healthy mother little pigs need no extra\r\nfeeding the first month. The sow should be given nourishing food, bran\r\nand ground oats and rye, lots of skim-milk and an abundance of clean,\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nIf the pigs seem hungry when only a couple of weeks old a little, new\r\ntrough should be made for them. A small quantity of boiled corn and\r\nskim-milk should be put into this trough where the little fellows can\r\nget to it but the sow cannot. They may not take much at first, but\r\nseveral hours later the trough should be rinsed and a fresh supply\r\ngiven. Sour, dirty milk may produce serious sickness in young pigs and\r\ncheck growth. The sow will wean them when she gets ready, and they will\r\nnot know the difference if they get used to their trough early.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to raise and fatten pigs in pens, but it is not\r\neconomical. Pasture is essential to their best growth. It gives them\r\nexercise, and the green food not only nourishes them, but aids in\r\nthe digestion of the more concentrated foods. The expression, \"Pigs\r\nin clover,\" is based on fact. A happy, healthy, money-maker is the\r\npasture-fed pig. He will put on his ten cents' worth a day of bone,\r\nmuscle and fat at less expense in a clover patch than elsewhere.\r\nAlfalfa or cow peas will serve him about as well. Fruit windfalls are\r\ngood for him, too.\r\n\r\nIf you live on a place where grain or fruit are the main crops and a\r\nfew cows are kept, you are losing a great opportunity if you are not\r\nraising a few pigs. They dispose of the surplus on such farms, as well\r\nas the unsalable garden crops and weeds, and pay their board day by day.\r\n\r\nThe owner should keep a close account with his pigs. If they eat what\r\nwould otherwise be wasted you are so much to the good. What you sell\r\nthem for, less what you have paid out for food, equals what you get for\r\nyour time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING CHICKENS\r\n\r\nSuccess with chickens does not depend upon the breed, nor upon any\r\npatent devices for hatching and brooding, nor on any special mixture\r\nof feed. You can find frenzied advertisers trying to disprove these\r\nstatements, but do not your own observations bear me out? However, I\r\nventure to say that with common-sense and gumption, and a real liking\r\nfor chickens, success in this line is nearly certain. There are dozens\r\nof good stories of boys who have begun chicken raising at twelve\r\nto fourteen years of age and have made money at it, beside training\r\nthemselves at the same time in business methods and efficiency. There\r\nare no good reasons why girls also should not succeed.\r\n\r\nThere are certain principles of poultry culture upon which most people\r\nagree. These are based on a knowledge of hen nature and are the result\r\nof study and experience. We will discuss them under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1, Housing and Care; 2, Food and Feeding; 3, Raising Young Stock; 4,\r\nBusiness Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame for eleven-dollar chicken house]\r\n\r\nThis first department properly includes not only the house proper with\r\nall its interior fixtures and its care, but the runs, the scratching\r\nshed, and all that has to do with the supply of air, warmth and\r\nsunshine and the protection of the flock from disease and vermin. No\r\nmatter how plain and ordinary your chicken house is, the test of your\r\nfitness for the business comes with its care, not once a month, but\r\nday by day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chicken house a boy can build]\r\n\r\nMany people have an idea that the only way to keep hens healthy and\r\nproductive is to let them range. Of course it is true that chickens\r\non the farm seem to pick up a free living, but it is equally true\r\nthat, as a general thing, the farmer does not keep any account with\r\nhis chickens, and if they get into the corn crib or granary he does\r\nnot know how much grain they eat and how much they waste. If they hide\r\ntheir nests and the eggs spoil, or if they sit and the chicks do not\r\nlive to get to the barnyard, the owner is unaware of his loss. If,\r\nhaving no house and nest boxes, the hens lay in the weeds, in the wood\r\npile, in the straw stack, in the haymow, it's no loss, for the women\r\nand children hunt the eggs and their time isn't worth anything! But\r\ndo you believe there are any farm hens whose portraits will appear\r\nin the big magazines? Did you see that one last year in _Collier's\r\nWeekly_? Do you suppose there are many 200-eggers on farms with all\r\ntheir supposed advantages? I don't. But we shall never know, because no\r\naccurate records can be kept of chickens that run at large.\r\n\r\nI shall take it for granted that you expect to begin in a small way\r\nwith very little to invest. Remember that a few hens pay better per\r\nhen than a large number, but on the other hand it takes about as much\r\ntime to care for a dozen as it does for one hundred. You will therefore\r\nlook forward with satisfaction to increasing your flock as your capital\r\ngrows and your time becomes more valuable.\r\n\r\nHave you a suitable place for chickens? It should be dry, sunny,\r\nthough with some shade, protected from severe winds and storms. The\r\nsun is the greatest purifier and disinfector in the universe, and you\r\nmust have your house face the south or east if possible. Whether your\r\nfirst house is made of store boxes or of expensive matched lumber the\r\nprinciples are the same. To make the house _dry_ it should be built on\r\nwell-drained soil and should sit up six inches from the surface of the\r\nground so that air can circulate freely beneath.\r\n\r\nThe only heat in the hen house comes from the hens and the sunshine.\r\nTherefore, to make the house _warm_ you should have it small enough\r\nso that your hens can generate heat enough to keep warm in winter.\r\nThe exposure should be such that the sun can get into it. If possible\r\nit should be shaded by trees or other buildings against storms and\r\nsummer sun. Every hen needs from four to five square feet of floor\r\nspace and only eight to ten cubic feet of air space. Square houses are\r\nmore economical to build. Figure out with diagrams and drawings to\r\nscale just how large a building is needed to house your flock when you\r\nget it. How low at the back can you make it without bumping your head\r\nwhen you go inside? How high in front must it be to provide space for\r\nyour door and window? What shaped roof will be easiest to build, most\r\neconomical of lumber, and most satisfactory as a rain shed?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Self-feed grit box]\r\n\r\nConsider many things in the selection of material. Rough boards are a\r\nlittle cheaper, but how they do ruin good paint and whitewash brushes!\r\nMatched boards are cheaper and tighter than unmatched boards with\r\nstrips nailed over the cracks. For the roof some kind of waterproof\r\nroofing material will keep the house warm and dry. If you have ever\r\nseen a chicken house with a cement floor you will be determined to have\r\nthat kind. At first the expense may be greater than for boards, but if\r\nyou live in your own home you can afford to put a cement floor in the\r\nchicken house sooner or later, especially if you do the work yourself.\r\nIf you are a renter you will not feel like putting in expensive,\r\npermanent improvements. It will be warm and dry, saving many losses\r\nfrom wet feet and diseases brought on by dampness and cold. It is easy\r\nto clean. It will do away with the rat problem, and last forever. You\r\ncan put it in after the house is built. Figure out the cost of a layer\r\nof cement one and one half inches thick laid on a bed of gravel and\r\nsmall stones. The cement is mixed as follows: one part Portland cement,\r\nthree parts clean sand, five parts gravel. Mix the cement pretty thick,\r\ntamp it down conscientiously until perfectly level, then with a trowel\r\nsmooth it and smooth it, over and over, until the surface is free from\r\nanything like a stone or large pebble.\r\n\r\nThe door to the chicken house should be well hung, easy to open, shut,\r\nand lock. The window is to admit light and sunshine, especially the\r\nlatter. Very small panes may be cheap but they shut out the sun; twelve\r\neight by ten panes in a single sash make a window of convenient size.\r\nThe window should be placed so that the sun can get way back to the\r\nvery farthest corner of the house. A high window is better for this\r\nthan a low one. The diagram shows why.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The windows should be placed high enough to let the sun\r\nin to the back of the house]\r\n\r\nSunshine and exercise are necessary for healthy fowls. They can stand\r\ncold weather well, if they are kept dry and active. Scratching sheds or\r\nopen-front pens provide sunshine and exercise.\r\n\r\nScratching for food in the litter keeps hens moving and they get to\r\nbe very athletic, jumping up to cabbages and fresh meat or grain\r\nself-feeders hung just out of reach. Scratching sheds in the North need\r\nadjustable curtains of coarse muslin to keep out driving rain, snow,\r\nand sleet. The State Agricultural Experiment Station at Orono, Maine,\r\nhas made valuable studies of curtained sheds, and the use of this form\r\nof poultry house has found favour all over the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grain self-feeder for fowls]\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the hen house consists of roosts, dropping board,\r\nnests, dust box, and utensils to hold ground feed, grit, shell, and\r\nwater. In making and erecting each piece ask yourself, \"Will this be\r\neasy to clean?\" The roosts should be in the corner farthest from door\r\nand window, out of all draughts. There should be enough of them to\r\nprovide each fowl with six to eight inches of room and they should be\r\nset at least a foot apart. Do not have the roosts at different levels.\r\nIt is hen nature to want the highest place, and they will fight and\r\ncrowd and worry each other if there is a higher roost. Pieces of two by\r\ntwo, with the upper edge rounded, make good perches.\r\n\r\nAs the floor of the chicken house is also the dining table for the\r\noccupants it is extremely important that there should be a well-built\r\nplatform under the roosts for droppings, in order to keep the floor\r\nclean. There should be space enough between this board and the perches\r\nto allow you to clean it frequently without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corner in chicken house, showing up-to-date furniture]\r\n\r\nIf you ever tried to clean a range of wall nests you know why the\r\nup-to-date poultry men are discarding them as unsanitary. Many are\r\nnow placing their nests under the dropping board. They are out of\r\nthe way here, not too high for the hens, nor too low for you. Square\r\nnests, fourteen inches each way and at least a foot from the droppings\r\nplatform, are satisfactory. A long door hinged at the top and hooked\r\nat the bottom should form the back of a row of nests. You open this to\r\ngather eggs and to clean the nests. The front, where the hens enter,\r\nshould be in behind under the platform. As it is rather dark in there,\r\nthe hens are pleased, because they like to preserve the old-time\r\nfiction that they are hiding their nests away. The nest should be five\r\nor six inches deep. Straw is the best nesting material. Short hay is\r\nnext best. A hen cannot be happy with excelsior twisted round her toes\r\nand an unhappy hen is an unproductive hen.\r\n\r\nThe dust bath must be provided. Most baths are wet but hens are dry\r\ncleaners. The dust bath must be dry to be of any use; the lighter,\r\nfiner, and dryer the better. A sunny corner of the house or shed is the\r\nbest place. Sifted coal ashes and street dust is a good mixture.\r\n\r\nAllow just as much space for the runs as you can afford to fence. If\r\npossible divide the enclosure in two and keep one part seeded to clover\r\nwhile the chickens are in the other. The heavier fowls usually make\r\nvery little trouble flying over a fence of five foot wire netting even\r\nthough it have no top strip. Clipping one wing may be necessary to\r\nrestrain some individuals. Small trees in the runs are most desirable.\r\nPlant there such small fruit trees as plum or cherry and the hens will\r\nhelp to keep insects in check.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Covered dust bath in sunny corner]\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest items of work in the chicken business is keeping\r\nthe house clean. The health, comfort, happiness, and the very life of\r\nthe hens, as well as the business, depend on this. Many a boy with a\r\nsort of natural knack at carpentry can build a chicken house out of\r\nsecond-hand lumber or out of a couple of piano boxes. But it takes a\r\nlong distance form of gumption to keep any chicken house sanitary.\r\nThe droppings should be cleaned up often and right here a word to the\r\nwise. Hen manure is a valuable garden fertilizer _if_ it is sprinkled\r\nwith land plaster while fresh. Otherwise it may become very nearly\r\nworthless. So if you have a garden or can dispose of your fertilizer\r\nevery day or two you can make something extra on this by-product by a\r\nsemi-weekly cleaning of roosts and droppings board. Litter is not dirt\r\nin the chicken house but it ought to be dry, fresh litter.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that the house should look clean. The obvious dirt,\r\nbad as it is, does less harm than the almost invisible vermin that\r\nlurk in the crevices of roosts, nests, and walls. Whitewash is a very\r\nwholesome finish for the interior and should be put on at least twice a\r\nyear. This is not enough however. Every square inch of surface should\r\nbe wet thoroughly with some liquid which is sure death to vermin. Spray\r\nor brush may be used. I wonder if this could be done too often in hot\r\nweather. Once a month is probably often enough if good insect powder\r\nis used on the hens and in the nests. In winter the vermin are less\r\nactive, but it is not safe to neglect them even then.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD AND FEEDING\r\n\r\nHens are known to be omnivorous. They must have animal and mineral as\r\nwell as vegetable food. They need these things in variable quantities\r\ndepending on their occupation. The hen's main duties are growing,\r\nlaying, brooding, moulting, fattening. She needs a great variety of\r\nthese three classes of foods throughout her life. Study your flock,\r\nread of the experiences of others in magazines, bulletins, and books,\r\nfollow their advice, and work out mixtures and methods to suit your\r\nconditions after you gain experience. The hens will give you many a\r\nhint. Let them out of the pen now and then just before feeding time\r\nand see how they make for the grass. In the evening the earthworms are\r\nnear the surface. The hens devour them greedily. You can get the flock\r\nback easily if you have a call, whistle, or other signal which they\r\nassociate with grain-scattering, but they will go in at twilight anyhow.\r\n\r\nSitting hens need less food because of their sedentary occupation. The\r\nmain thing is to keep food and fresh water where they can get it when\r\nthey want it, or see that they go to it regularly.\r\n\r\nBroody hens are a trial. The common practices of starving them, ducking\r\nthem, and otherwise subjecting them to indignities, are little short\r\nof cruel and often fail to cure their natural desire to sit. Stop and\r\nreason not with, but about, the hen. Having laid all the eggs nature\r\nhas provided during the spring, the hen's instinct is to brood and rear\r\na nestful. She has worked hard and maybe is run down physically. Feel\r\nher bones. What you want from her is more eggs. Instead of wasting time\r\n\"getting even\" with her for being a nuisance, try some rational way of\r\nbreaking up her desire to sit. Remove her immediately from the nest to\r\na coop. Instead of starving her give her a plentiful supply of the diet\r\nyou have found best for layers. She will probably soon begin to lay\r\nagain if treated sensibly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Racks over feed pans prevent waste and soiling food]\r\n\r\nMoulting is a perfectly natural process but it occurs at the end of\r\nthe season and the chickens are often in a low state of vitality.\r\nFor this reason it is a critical time. Study the hens. Find out what\r\ntheir physical condition is at moulting season. The best condition is\r\nhalf-way between fat and thin. If they are thin, provide a wholesome\r\ndiet rich in fatty foods, as corn, oats, sunflower, and some flaxseed,\r\nwith bran, meat scraps, and clover. If heavy with fat from too rich\r\na diet in the summer, less of the fat-producing foods makes a better\r\nmoulting diet.\r\n\r\nThe quality and flavour of the eggs and meat depend pretty much on the\r\nkind of food given. If filth is taken into the hen's system it affects\r\nher general health and efficiency. There is an opinion that hens and\r\npigs are by nature dirty. We will not stop to argue that, but your hens\r\nwill eat nothing but clean food if nothing else is provided. That's\r\ncertain! Look to your feeding racks and watering pans. Use water freely\r\nand a stiff brush or cloth. Clean water is positively necessary. All\r\nsorts of diseases lurk in dirty houses, filthy runs, and stale, unclean\r\nfeeding and drinking pans.\r\n\r\nRegularity in feeding is important. Do not go into this business if\r\nyou expect frequently to be otherwise employed at feeding time. The\r\nmain feedings are two, morning and late afternoon, for whole or cracked\r\ngrain scattered in the litter. Ground grain should be there, in a\r\nhopper, at all hours in summer and all the afternoon the rest of the\r\nyear. The exercise they must take to get the grain keeps the hens from\r\ngetting fat and lazy.\r\n\r\nA busy hen is a happy hen and a productive hen. Hang a half cabbage up\r\njust out of reach in the house on a stormy day and see them train for\r\nthe standing broad jump! If you can get what is known as \"the haslet,\"\r\nreally the lungs, heart, and liver of a porker or lamb, you can suspend\r\nthis in the same way and they will work all the better for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING YOUNG CHICKENS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Model chicken coop--open on pleasant days]\r\n\r\nIt is poor practice to set your hens in the chicken house. Prepare\r\nas many fresh nests as you expect to need. Put them in the cellar,\r\nunused shed, under the porch, or any convenient and protected place.\r\nDoors of wire netting or slats are a great convenience. When a hen is\r\nbroody, take her off the nest the first night and put her into the\r\nnew place with an artificial egg or two. Ten to one she will stay all\r\nright. If not, do not waste time with her. When assured that her mind\r\nis unalterably made up, give her thirteen eggs and close the door on\r\nher again. Set two or three the same day and later combine the flocks\r\nunder one hen. Select the eggs with reference to their shape, size, and\r\nquality of shell. Misshapen, very large, or very small eggs or those\r\nwith thin shells are worthless for setting. Set the eggs of the best\r\nlayers. Every morning take sitters off nests, leave food and water for\r\nthem, and return in half an hour. Usually they are all back in their\r\nplaces in less time than that. If not, you can replace and shut them in\r\nagain. In eighteen to twenty-one days the eggs will hatch.\r\n\r\nProbably more little chicks die from lice than from any other cause.\r\nPreventive measures must begin early. Get fresh, dry insect powder and\r\ntreat the nest and hen about the third, the ninth, and the fifteenth\r\nday of incubation. Rub the powder all through the feathers. Fine dust\r\nobstructs the breathing pores of the lice and kills them. When you\r\ntake the chicks from the nest examine the head, neck, and vent regions\r\nof every one. If lice are present a drop of melted lard will put an end\r\nto them. Constant vigilance and nothing short of it, will prevent death\r\nfrom lice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prop the door open, thus, in rain, wind, or too hot sun]\r\n\r\nA good home-made lice powder, costing only about four cents a pound,\r\nmay be made as follows: Mix together one quarter pint crude carbolic\r\nacid (90 per cent. pure), and three quarters of a pint of gasolene.\r\nStir into this enough plaster of Paris to take up the liquid, (about\r\ntwo and one half pounds). Mix thoroughly and rub through a wire\r\nmosquito screen to break the lumps. This can be used to dust through\r\nthe feathers, the day after it is made. Keep in a tight jar or box.\r\nThis powder is the invention of an expert in poultry husbandry.\r\n\r\nThe coops for hen and chicks need not be ponderous, but they should be\r\nrain proof. A coop two and one half feet square with removable roof\r\nand floor is not too heavy to handle and answers every purpose. A wire\r\nnetting run three or four feet long attached to each coop is necessary\r\nand this combination will house a hen and from fifteen to twenty\r\nchickens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Closed for the night. Vermin-proof, weather-proof.\r\nScreen-covered ventilator on one side]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bottom of model coop can be cleaned by lifting up the\r\ncoop]\r\n\r\nAll the food a young chick needs the first twenty-four hours is\r\nprovided by nature. After that it is \"up to you.\" Their first meal may\r\nbe hard-boiled eggs minced finely, shells and all, and mixed with\r\noatmeal or custard made of milk and eggs baked hard, or it may be baked\r\nand crumbled corn bread. By the third day they will be ready for raw\r\nbroken grain. There are many good commercial kinds: less trouble than\r\nmaking your own mixtures. The chicks will learn to scratch for this\r\nin a week or two. The hen is their teacher. Fine grit, charcoal, and\r\nclean water must be kept where they can get what they want. Soft food\r\nshould not be fed in unlimited quantities; give what they will eat in\r\nfive or ten minutes, then take it away. They are likely to over-eat of\r\nwet mashes, but what they have to work for is not likely to give them\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nWhen chickens are two months old they no longer need wet mash. They\r\nshould now have access to food whenever they want it. A mixture of\r\ncracked corn, wheat, beef scrap, bone, grit, shell, and other grains,\r\nwith dry middlings and bran, may be put into a slatted self-feeder,\r\nlike the illustration, easily constructed by yourself. It is not much\r\ntrouble to see that this is never empty. If fed only at intervals they\r\nrush at you, bolt the biggest grains, stuff their crops, crowd away\r\nweak or modest ones; result, some are under-fed, others are over-fed.\r\nIf food is kept where they can get it whenever they happen to think\r\nof it they take a reasonable amount, then visit the growing clover or\r\ngrass, pick up a casual pebble, take a drink of water, scratch out a\r\nworm, and return to the feed tray, all in natural course of the day's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nYou will want to get rid of most of your young cockerels as soon as\r\nthey are marketable. Broilers bring highest prices. To put them in\r\ntip-top condition they should be fattened for about two to three weeks\r\nwhen they are four months old. There is nothing better for fattening\r\nthan a mash made of equal parts finely ground corn meal and wheat\r\nmiddlings with one fourth the quantity of meat meal. This should be wet\r\nwith sour skim-milk or buttermilk and fed in a semi-liquid condition,\r\nabout the consistency of pancake batter. Ground oats may be added. The\r\nproduct is known in the highest priced city hotels as \"milk fed\" or\r\neven \"cream fed\" chicken. If you can get skim-milk cheap why not buy\r\na bunch of young cockerels and stuff them for market? They have been\r\nknown to put on a pound for every five pounds of this mixture eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS METHODS\r\n\r\nThe day you drive your first nail into what is to be your chicken\r\nhouse you should start an account. Every item should go down, cost of\r\nmaterials, cost of stock, cost of feed. Economize where you can by\r\nutilizing vacant space for growing clover for summer feed and some\r\nroot crop like mangolds for winter supply. Apples are fine in winter\r\nfor hens. You can often get bushels of windfalls for the picking.\r\nSunflowers are easy to grow and their heads hold a tremendous lot of\r\nchicken feed. Table scraps ground with a hand mill vary the hen's diet,\r\nbut do avoid sloppy messes.\r\n\r\nThere are two sides to every account. If you charge the chickens with\r\nwhat they cost you, it is only fair to yourself and to them to credit\r\nthem with the eggs and meat they furnish, as well as with increase of\r\nstock, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trap-nest open. The hen's weight shuts the door behind\r\nher]\r\n\r\nIn every flock there are some idlers. They lay only a hundred or so\r\neggs, they leave their eggs too long when sitting, or they never put\r\non any weight. You want to be rid of all such. You can mark the bad\r\nsitters, and send them to the pot, as well as those whose habits are\r\nsuch as to make them a nuisance. But you need to know which fowls lay\r\nthe biggest and best eggs and which lay the largest number. For market\r\nin our country where eggs are sold by the dozen it is numbers that\r\ncount, but for breeding you want eggs of good size and shape. You also\r\nwant to set the eggs of the good layers. These eggs taste no better\r\nin cake or omelet, but by careful selection you can breed a strain\r\nof extra good layers, right in your hen house. The device known as a\r\ntrap-nest is the thing you will need if you go at it scientifically.\r\nYou want it in winter, too, to prevent killing your best hens for\r\npotpie, while the idlers cheerfully eat your grain without recompense.\r\nThe simpler the mechanism of the trap-nest the better. It must stand\r\nopen until the hen enters, then close without frightening her. Most of\r\nthem keep the hen a prisoner until you go and examine the nest, credit\r\nthe hen by her leg-band number, and release her. By following the\r\ndrawings in the bulletins of the New York and Maine Experiment Stations\r\nreferred to in the list of bulletins on chickens you can construct your\r\nown trap-nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trap-nest closed after hen has gone in]\r\n\r\nThere are people who claim that \"common chickens\" or mixed breeds\r\nare hardier than pure bred fowls and better all around producers.\r\nHow many can show records to make good that claim? American boys and\r\ngirls who go into chicken raising will want to breed from good pure\r\nstock. Nothing is too good for them. Did you ever hear any one show any\r\nenthusiasm when passing a flock of mongrels? Contrast this with the\r\ndelight you and all your friends take in the sight of a hundred fowls\r\nall white, all red, all spangled, all black, all piebald, all blue,\r\nor all speckled, as alike as peas in a pod! I vote for the pure stock\r\nevery time. You can keep it pure and strong by exchanging cockerels\r\nwith other breeders of the same variety and with similar ideals and\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nKeeping chickens isn't mere child's play. There's lots to be done. You\r\nmust be carpenter, gardener, breeder, merchant, and even doctor, all\r\nrolled into one. But there is fun in it and profit in it. Better than\r\nall, there is a satisfaction in doing a good job and doing it well, and\r\nit keeps a boy out of doors where he belongs if he's a healthy boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EGG RECORDS\r\n  HOUSE NO.

It goes\r\nwith the trap-nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A useful hen gate]\r\n\r\nAs with many other products of home industry the first and best market\r\nis the home market. Credit the hens with every pound of meat you\r\nfurnish for the table and every egg consumed by the family. But you\r\nwill soon need to extend your market. Across the street, up and down\r\non both sides, you can find people who like \"personally conducted\"\r\neggs and prefer that the fowls served on their tables should be\r\nacquaintances rather than the embalmed kind. You must be business man\r\nenough to work up a trade for fresh, clean eggs in attractive packages,\r\nand for wholesome meat. It would be a good stroke of business to date\r\nyour eggs if you know what demand you can depend on. That would help\r\nimpress the idea of real freshness on the consumer's mind.\r\n\r\nIf you pluck fowls for market it will interest you to know that\r\nfeathers have a market value. They should be plucked dry and the wing\r\nand tail feathers kept separate. Any large city dealer in chickens will\r\nprobably take your feathers. By-products often make the difference\r\nbetween plus and minus in a year's business.\r\n\r\nThe winner of the first prize of one hundred dollars in the Junior\r\nPoultry Contest of the Oregon Agricultural College tells this story:\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING CHICKENS\r\n\r\nBoys and girls should raise chickens in the city as well as on the farm\r\nbecause it pays and is a fine occupation. It is a work that never grows\r\ntiresome and new experiences are always awaiting you. Various theories\r\nare advocated as to the proper manner of feeding and housing to get\r\nthe best results but simple rules are the best to begin with. Plenty\r\nof clean water, clean houses and yards and good feed are needed to get\r\nthe best results. Spade up a little in the chicken yard every day that\r\nis pleasant, but if it is cold and in wet weather provide a scratching\r\nshed. Keep the hens busy. Read the bulletins furnished free by the\r\ngovernment and the various experiment stations. Also subscribe to a\r\ngood poultry paper. The ideas you will get from these together with\r\nyour own experience will make you a successful poultry raiser. By doing\r\nall that was stated above I was able to win first prize in the poultry\r\ncontest just closed.\r\n\r\n                                                      CLARENCE A. HOGAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS WITH CHICKENS\r\n\r\nThe contest of the Portland Junior Poultry Association has closed. It\r\nlasted a whole year, and it seemed as if it would never come to an end.\r\nBut if it had not been for the contest I would never have known many of\r\nthe interesting things I now know about chickens.\r\n\r\nI had twelve white Leghorn hens and a cock entered. They were all\r\nlittle beauties and I enjoyed working with them very much.\r\n\r\nThey laid one thousand six hundred twenty-two eggs during the year. The\r\neggs were worth from twenty-five to sixty cents a dozen. We fed them\r\nwheat, corn, barley, oats, and bran in which table scraps were mixed,\r\noyster shells, grit, prepared beef scraps, charcoal, and green foods\r\nsuch as grass from the lawn, cabbage, kale, and lettuce and other\r\ngreen things from the garden. Each hen made us a profit of two dollars\r\nand seventy-two cents for the year.\r\n\r\nChickens need lots of care. Their house must be cleaned out, there\r\nshould be some fresh ground dug up in the yard, and they need some\r\ngreen food every day. Papa took care of the house, and I mowed the lawn\r\nand gave them the clippings and gathered cabbage leaves, kale leaves,\r\nand lettuce leaves out of the garden and gave them each day.\r\n\r\nIn the spring time we let them out a few minutes every morning to get\r\nbugs and worms. They soon had all the bugs and worms scratched out\r\nof the garden and then they ran out in the yard and scratched up the\r\nflower beds, which did not please mamma very well. After that they\r\nwanted to go to the neighbour's yard but we had to keep them up. This\r\nwas before we made the garden.\r\n\r\nChickens make nice pets. They are much nicer than dogs or cats, and\r\nif you take good care of them they will pay well beside. I had a nice\r\nlittle white Leghorn hen I called \"Petty.\" When she was a little\r\nchicken I would catch her every day and play with her. She would go in\r\nthe nest and wait for some one to take her out and pet her. She got so\r\ntame that I could catch her any place in the yard. I would go in the\r\nyard and get her and take her out in the garden and dig for her and let\r\nher find the bugs and worms.\r\n\r\nI had another little chicken that I called \"Jim.\" He was a cute little\r\nrooster. When he was just a little chicken I would put him to bed every\r\nnight and when he grew a little older he would not go to bed alone.\r\nOne night we weren't at home at his bedtime and when we came home that\r\nnight we heard a funny little noise in the back yard. It was raining\r\nand Jim had gone under the sweet pea vines to sleep instead of going\r\ninto his box.\r\n\r\nThe first little chicks we hatched we took away from the hen and raised\r\nthem by hand. For about a week after they were hatched we put them in\r\na basket and covered them over with warm, woollen cloths and set them\r\nby the stove to keep warm over night. I had a peach box with a wire\r\ncovering to keep them in, in the daytime. On sunshiny days we set them\r\nout in the sunshine but after about a week they were not satisfied with\r\nthat. I decided that what they wanted was to get out and run for bugs.\r\nSo one afternoon when I came home from school it was nice and sunshiny\r\nand I let them out of their box. When they first stepped into the grass\r\nthey were surprised. That was the first time they had ever stepped\r\non the lawn. They ran right to a rose bush and stayed right there all\r\nthe time picking off bugs. Each evening I let them out they would go\r\na little farther away from home. At last they had caught all the bugs\r\naround the place and if we did not watch, they would run over to the\r\nneighbour's yard. I am anxious for the time to come when we will have\r\nmore little chicks.\r\n\r\n                                                             RUTH HAYES\r\n\r\nThe girl who tells this story is thirteen years old. She won second\r\nprize, fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER PRIZE WINNER'S STORY\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I have been taking care of poultry I have been\r\nsuccessful. I only had six chickens in the Oregon Junior Poultry\r\nContest, five hens and a rooster, but I have about fifty other chickens\r\nto take care of. The chickens that I had in the contest were Black\r\nMinorcas, but I also raise White Wyandottes. I seem to have better\r\nsuccess with my White Wyandottes than with my Black Minorcas. The\r\nhouse I have for the contest chickens is twelve feet wide and six feet\r\nlong. The place they roost in is four feet by six and the rest is a\r\nscratching shed, which is eight feet by six. The house is open front\r\nand has a ground floor, which is dry and the chickens can dust in it.\r\n\r\nI feed them three times a day, grain morning and noon, which I feed\r\nin litter, and a warm mash at night so they can go to roost warm. I\r\nalso keep bran, charcoal, and grit before them all the time. I have\r\na bone cutter, and feed cut bone to my chickens once a week. I clean\r\noff the drop board every morning, and once a week I coal-oil the roost\r\nand where the roost rests. During this cold weather I do not let the\r\nchickens out very early and when it is raining I do not let them out\r\nat all. Every night after the chickens have gone to roost I go out and\r\nthrow a little grain in their litter and that gives them something to\r\ndo the first thing in the morning.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I did not have a photograph of myself to send you.\r\n\r\n                                                         FRANK MITCHELL\r\n\r\n\r\nA BOY FEEDS SIX THOUSAND HENS IN HALF AN HOUR\r\n\r\nWhat do you know about that? I saw this feat done last winter by a\r\nfourteen-year old California boy, and I took his photograph as he was\r\ndoing it. What can a boy not do if he has the opportunity? There are\r\nother boys who find it a harder task and a more disagreeable one to\r\nfeed half a dozen hens. A boy can feed six thousand hens and gather two\r\nor three thousand eggs a day and go to school.\r\n\r\nThis California boy had a gray pony to help him, but what enabled him\r\nto perform this feat day after day was system. His uncle, the owner of\r\nthe farm, had planned the work to make it easy. The farm contains one\r\nhundred and twenty acres, and the six thousand hens are scattered over\r\nthe whole farm in colony houses. The system of feeding was a liberal\r\nfeed of soft mash in the morning. Three colony houses were placed\r\ntogether. The middle one was a laying house; the other two, roosting\r\nhouses. In one end of the laying house there was a wheat bin holding\r\nseveral sacks of wheat. The bin was a self-feeding hopper. After dinner\r\nthe fourteen-year old boy jumped on his gray horse and made the rounds\r\nof the houses, opening a door to the hopper of wheat, so that the hens\r\ncould eat at will during the afternoon. It took just a moment to jump\r\noff of his horse, open the door, and jump on again, the horse going on\r\nthe lope between the houses. He made the rounds in less than half an\r\nhour. About three or four o'clock he hitched his pony to a low wagon\r\nand visited all the houses, gathering the eggs. This was a bigger job\r\nthan feeding the hens; he could not go as fast with the eggs. In the\r\nmorning, about seven o'clock, he makes the rounds of the houses, and\r\nwithout getting off his horse opens the doors to the laying houses, and\r\ndoes it all in fifteen minutes. What do you know about that?\r\n\r\n                                                           JAMES DRYDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMATEUR'S EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nIn April, nineteen hundred and one, I purchased four broody hens, two\r\nsettings of White Wyandotte eggs, and two of Plymouth Rock. I live\r\nin a suburban district where dogs and cats abound and poultry cannot\r\nhave free range. I therefore made two wire-covered board runs, six\r\nfeet by eight, eighteen inches high, and against a six-inch hole sawed\r\nin one end of each I placed a box turned on its side for a coop. Of\r\ntwenty-eight Wyandotte eggs, twenty-six hatched, and three chicks died.\r\nOf twenty-six Plymouth Rocks only three hatched, and these I put with\r\nthe Wyandottes in care of the two most motherly hens.\r\n\r\nEvery morning I fed a mash of meal, shorts, and beef scraps, in equal\r\nparts, mixed dry with boiling water; at noon and night oatmeal,\r\ncracked wheat, or occasionally cracked corn, and clean table scraps\r\nat any time. Oyster shells and fresh water were always before them.\r\nMothers and children ate together, each taking what she liked best. As\r\noften as they soiled the grass I shifted the runs, and on fine days I\r\nlet the families out for an hour before dark into an adjoining field,\r\nkeeping an eye on their wanderings.\r\n\r\nOctober first I sold the four hens, which had laid meanwhile fifteen\r\nand a half dozen eggs. Twelve chicks were cockerels, which were killed\r\nas needed.\r\n\r\nNovember first I reduced the daily feed to two meals--a warm mash at\r\nhalf past eight A.M. so that they would scratch awhile before being\r\nfed, and for supper grain, generally oats, scattered about the yard,\r\nwith a few handfuls inside the house to induce more scratching. They\r\nhad all they would eat, but if they left any food I skipped the next\r\nmeal and let them get hungry. The water was renewed often, dishes kept\r\nclean, and field excursions continued occasionally.\r\n\r\nNovember sixth I sold the first dozen eggs, and for eleven months the\r\nsupply never failed. The eggs were large, and the hens were active,\r\nhealthy, and happy. Any success I attribute to moderate feeding,\r\nexercise, and cleanliness.\r\n\r\n    _May 1, 1901, to August 15, 1902_\r\n\r\n                               EXPENSES\r\n\r\n    Eggs, White Wyandotte                     $2.00\r\n    Express                                     .25\r\n    Eggs, Plymouth Rock                        1.00\r\n    4 hens                                     2.60\r\n    Boards, net, and boxes                     1.22\r\n    Grain, 15½ months                         31.41\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             $38.48\r\n\r\n                               RECEIPTS\r\n\r\n    Eggs, 14 pullets, 162 dozen              $47.33\r\n    Eggs, 4 hens, 15½ dozen                    3.92\r\n    12 cockerels, 55¼ pounds                  10.35\r\n    4 hens                                     2.00\r\n    14 hens (sold by reason of my illness)     8.00\r\n    2 barrels dressing                         1.50\r\n    Runs, etc., on hand                        1.00\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             $74.10\r\n                                              38.48\r\n                                             ------\r\n          Profit                             $35.62\r\n\r\n                                                        BELLE S. CRAGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I STARTED WITH HENS\r\n\r\nI am a boy, thirteen years old, and have always been very fond of farm\r\nanimals, especially chickens. I like the White Wyandottes best for\r\nall-around, general-purpose fowls. They lay well, and when they are\r\ndressed for market there are no dark pin-feathers to spoil their looks.\r\n\r\nIn April, nineteen hundred and five, I purchased two settings of White\r\nWyandotte eggs at the Rhode Island College, and borrowed two broody\r\nhens. I bought one of these hens later, but she soon died. I fixed up\r\nan old pig house that was on the place, and set the hens in this house.\r\n\r\nWhile they were sitting, papa helped me make two coops and pens for\r\nthem. For the coop I took a dry-goods box, about four feet by one and\r\none half feet by fifteen inches, and made a door in one corner large\r\nenough to admit a hen. In one end I bored some holes and covered them\r\nwith wire netting, for ventilation.\r\n\r\nFor the pen I took four pieces of scantling and a good supply of laths.\r\nI used the pieces of scantling for the corner-posts and nailed the\r\nlaths on the sides, top, and one end. I did not put anything on the\r\nother end except the top and bottom strips. The pen is just the length\r\nof a lath, but the width is a little less. The open end is placed\r\nagainst the front of the coop; the hen can then come out into the pen,\r\nand the chicks can go anywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile the chicks hatched and there were sixteen of them. At\r\nfirst I fed them a mash of corn meal and bran and later a little\r\ncracked corn and wheat. They grew finely, but I raised only thirteen of\r\nthem, eight of which were pullets.\r\n\r\nI fed them in the back yard for a while, but they dug the grass up so\r\nthat I had to stop it. Then I built a scratching-pen by the wood shed,\r\nto feed them in.\r\n\r\nIn the summer the chickens were roosting in the trees, and when cold\r\nweather came and I wanted them to roost in the hen house they would not\r\ndo it. I tried feeding them there, and driving them in; but that did\r\nnot work very well, because I could not drive them all in at once, and\r\nwhen I drove some in and tried to get the rest, the first ones would\r\ncome out again. So I had my brother help me, and every night we would\r\ncarry them down to the hen house. After a time they learned to roost\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe pullets began to lay early in November and laid well all winter. I\r\nam proud of one of my hens. She laid two hundred and thirty-eight eggs\r\nfrom the eighth of November, nineteen hundred and five, to the fifth of\r\nAugust, nineteen hundred and six. I think this is a very good record,\r\nconsidering that during the most of that time she was fed nothing but\r\ncracked corn.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the winter of nineteen hundred and six to\r\nnineteen hundred and seven the hens did not lay very well, and I asked\r\none of the poultry men at the Rhode Island College what to feed them to\r\nmake them lay. He told me what he had fed with good success, and as it\r\nmade my hens lay, it may make somebody else's hens lay.\r\n\r\n                                 GRAIN\r\n\r\n                                    { Whole corn\r\n    Equal parts, by weight, of      { Wheat\r\n                                    { Oats\r\n\r\n                                 MASH\r\n\r\n                                    { Bran\r\n    Equal parts, by weight, of      { Middlings\r\n                                    { Corn meal\r\n                                    { Beef scraps\r\n\r\nThis means that they will get more wheat and oats than corn, and more\r\nbran and middlings than corn meal. I feed the grain morning and night,\r\nand the mash at noon. The mash may be fed either wet or dry. I have\r\ntried it both ways but I like to feed it dry fully as well for two\r\nreasons: First the hens cannot gobble it up so fast and all get an\r\nequal share; second, the hens lay just as well and it saves labour.\r\n\r\nFeed is expensive here and it cost me three dollars and thirty-nine\r\ncents for one hundred pounds of both kinds. I think I shall continue to\r\nfeed it till I find something better, and I would recommend it to any\r\none who desires a good, satisfactory feed.\r\n\r\nMy poultry record for one year is as follows:\r\n\r\n                            POULTRY ACCOUNT\r\n\r\n          DR.

CARD\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ONE YOUNG WOMAN MADE A START WITH POULTRY\r\n\r\nWe had long dreamed of a country home, my mother and I--of a place\r\nwhere living expenses would be lessened and which would be pleasant\r\nduring the summer for my sisters, who teach eight months of the year--a\r\nplace where we could add materially to our income by keeping chickens.\r\n\r\nAfter discarding the idea of buying near New York City, because of\r\nthe higher value of land and greater cost of living, we chose a place\r\nof twelve acres on the edge of an aristocratic old town in western\r\nNew York. Being within the corporation limits we have water and sewer\r\nconnections, hardware and lumber delivered (which is quite an item when\r\none is building poultry houses); and, best of all, the expressman comes\r\nfor all eggs and poultry. A woman intending to go into the poultry\r\nbusiness will certainly find such a location a great advantage over\r\nbeing farther from town. The increase in taxes is slight. The cost of\r\nexpressage is, of course, greater than if we had located near New York\r\nCity, but grain is cheaper.\r\n\r\nWe purchased the place in the fall to have possession the following\r\nMarch. During the winter, I took the three months' Poultry Course at\r\nCornell University. The course is comprehensive and very practical.\r\nBeside learning the principles of poultry husbandry, I gained\r\nconfidence and courage.\r\n\r\nWe paid two thousand six hundred dollars for the property and spent\r\nfour hundred dollars more in plumbing and repairs on the house. The\r\nplace consists of about twelve acres of very good land, especially\r\nsuited for poultry, being somewhat sandy and sloping enough for\r\ndrainage. The house is small but well built. The view is magnificent,\r\nand the place is easily adaptable to some charming bits of landscape\r\ngardening which good taste and personal supervision can accomplish\r\nwithout expensive gardener's fees.\r\n\r\nWe first built some brooder houses, gasolene heated, as used at\r\nCornell, and purchased day-old chicks of a good laying strain. Late in\r\nthe summer we built a five-pen laying house, the pens being twenty by\r\ntwenty feet, using one pen for a feed room. The entire first year we\r\ntook care of the poultry ourselves, with the assistance of a schoolboy\r\nwho worked for his board. Most of the land was in hay, which we hired\r\ncut and sold, and we raised some corn. I knew nothing about farming,\r\nand was so interested in chickens that I had little time to study;\r\nhowever, I got the Cornell bulletins on alfalfa and started an acre\r\naccording to their suggestions. This has been successful and is fine\r\nfeed for poultry.\r\n\r\nThe second spring we hired a man by the month. One man can take care of\r\ntwelve hundred hens and the horse, carry coal, and drive for us some of\r\nthe time. The regular farm work we hire done by the day. A woman needs\r\nto pay special attention to keeping down the labour expenses.\r\n\r\nThe laying hens have about three acres for yards. This is divided into\r\nthree different yards, one for the four hundred best pullets which I\r\ntake the time to trap-nest, and the third one to be alternated with the\r\nother two so that they can all be ploughed and seeded, in order to keep\r\nthe ground from becoming contaminated. I have planted cherry trees in\r\none yard and will in the others later, to furnish shade for the fowls.\r\nI chose cherries for various reasons. They can stand the enrichment and\r\nthe treatment of the land necessary for poultry; also, if they are well\r\ncared for, sprayed, etc., I can get a fancy market for them at home.\r\nThe place had been noted in former years for its fine cherry orchard,\r\nso I believed the soil and location to be well adapted to them.\r\n\r\nWe felt we could not afford to build an incubator cellar, so we\r\nmoved the furniture from a north-east bedroom where we placed three\r\nfour-hundred-egg incubators. We closed the east shutters so that the\r\nmorning sun would not interfere with the temperature and used the north\r\nwindow for ventilation. It was successful and convenient.\r\n\r\nThe brooder houses are located near the house as long as the little\r\nchicks need heat. I have started a hedge for a windbreak in front\r\nof them, which will also screen the poultry part of the plantation\r\nfrom the house. When the chicks no longer need heat the hovers of the\r\nbrooder houses are removed and roosts put in. The houses, which are on\r\nrunners, are drawn to a cornfield as soon as the corn has grown enough\r\nnot to be injured by the chicks. Here they have free range all summer.\r\nBy moving the first hatches to some shack houses, which are cheaply\r\nbuilt, when the chicks no longer need heat the brooder houses can be\r\nused once again.\r\n\r\nThere are two cornfields for growing the pullets, to be used in\r\nalternate years so the ground will be fresh. The corn gives shade and a\r\nsense of security, besides furnishing a considerable part of the winter\r\nfeed. I hope to be able to grow corn for several successive years on\r\nthe same ground by sowing either clover or rape at the last cultivation\r\nto furnish humus for the land.\r\n\r\nThe following were our initial expenses:\r\n\r\n    3 400-egg incubators               $111.00\r\n    8 brooder houses                    320.00\r\n    4 shack houses                       60.00\r\n    Laying pen for 1,200 hens         1,500.00\r\n    Fences                               94.00\r\n    Tools and equipment for poultry     100.00\r\n                                     ---------\r\n        Total                        $2,185.00\r\n\r\nLast year I cleared two dollars over the cost of feed from each of my\r\nlayers, from the sale of eggs alone.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure and freedom of country life are worth much. A garden with\r\nhigh quality vegetables, fruit of all kinds and varieties, fresh eggs\r\nand poultry, goes a long way in making the cost of living less. (We\r\nsave cracked, small, or misshapen eggs for our own use.) With a saddle\r\nhorse and a tennis court, life in the country is far from dull.\r\n\r\nAVA HOOKER\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVING EGGS FOR WINTER USE\r\n\r\nWhen eggs are cheap and plenty is the time when it will pay to preserve\r\nsome for winter use. Remember, though, that no amount of preserving, or\r\ncold storing will make a fresh egg out of an old egg. As infertile eggs\r\nkeep better than fertile ones, it is well to separate the laying hens\r\nfrom the roosters when the hatching season is over.\r\n\r\nCold storage is undoubtedly the best method for keeping eggs in\r\nwholesale quantities, but for home consumption there is nothing more\r\nsatisfactory than a preservative called water glass which is _sodium\r\nsilicate_ and can be bought in crystal or liquid form at drug stores.\r\nProf. J. E. Rice of Cornell University says that \"the liquid form is\r\nvery much to be preferred owing to the fact that it is very difficult\r\nto dissolve the crystal. One part of water glass to nine parts of water\r\nmakes a liquid having a consistency not quite heavy enough to cause the\r\neggs to come to the surface, but still sufficiently strong to furnish\r\nthe coating which prevents the air from entering the shells.\"\r\n\r\nStone jars are recommended as inexpensive and not likely to leak.\r\nEggs taken out after nearly a year in the water glass and washed look\r\nlike fresh eggs. As to taste, a very fastidious person might find the\r\nflavour not quite right when served as boiled eggs. In all other ways\r\nthey are entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWith water glass, eggs can be preserved for less than two cents a\r\ndozen. In communities where the price of eggs varies from a cent apiece\r\nto four cents apiece it would be very profitable to preserve all the\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING GUINEA FOWL\r\n\r\nWhat would you expect if you ordered \"American pheasant\" from a bill\r\nof fare in a London restaurant? No matter what you expected, when the\r\nbird came onto the table it would be guinea hen! This is a dish you\r\nprobably never ate at home unless you live in the South, \"where they\r\nknow what's good,\" or make a practice of dining at fashionable hotels\r\nwhere they serve fancy game and poultry.\r\n\r\nMost of the guinea fowls marketed in this country are put into cold\r\nstorage and sent to England. They also bring a good price in city\r\nmarkets in this country.\r\n\r\nFarm boys and girls all over the country are familiar with the strident\r\nsquawk and the furtive, hunching trot of the speckled guinea fowl. I\r\ndoubt if any farmer could tell why he harbours one on the premises,\r\nunless it is to warn his chickens of the presence of danger. I know of\r\nvery few people in the North who eat either eggs or birds (if they know\r\nit), and the young are very seldom seen. Here is a really valuable game\r\nbird which silly prejudice is depriving of its fair share of attention.\r\n\r\nIf farm boys realized that there is a good and growing market for\r\nguinea fowls, eggs, and birds, they would read this: A fashionable New\r\nYork hotel served three thousand of these birds between January first\r\nand April thirteenth, nineteen hundred and five. Listen to the prices:\r\nfrom one dollar to one dollar and a half per pair for young broilers in\r\nmidwinter in the large Northern cities. Eggs twice the price of hens'\r\neggs. Taking into consideration the fact that they are hardier even as\r\nchicks than ordinary poultry and that the market is strictly fancy and\r\nnot oversupplied, the chances for success in guinea raising are good.\r\n\r\nIn beginning this branch of business it is not best to buy old fowls.\r\nThey are swift of wing, and they are extremely likely to take \"French\r\nleave\" unless closely confined for a week or more to their new\r\nquarters. This confinement is not very good for them. My advice is to\r\nbegin with a setting of fifteen eggs under a common hen in May or June.\r\nThe eggs are smaller than hens' eggs and have good, strong shells.\r\nThey take from twenty-six to thirty days to hatch. The treatment and\r\ncare of young guinea fowls varies from that given to young chickens in\r\na few particulars only, _e. g._, the chicks should be fed very _soon_\r\nafter hatching and need a large percentage of animal food when first\r\nhatched. Dry bread crumbs and hard-boiled eggs minced finely or pieces\r\nof cooked meat cut very fine are a good first meal. Bread and milk and\r\nfinely chopped lettuce, cress, or other vegetation should be given a\r\nday or two later. They will pick up innumerable insects if allowed the\r\nprivileges of the garden or fruit plantation. Little guineas should\r\nhave access to feed all the time as a few hours without food is very\r\nlikely to prove fatal. Like little pheasants they require a greater\r\npercentage of animal food than chickens because if in the wild they\r\nwould eat little else. Soft grains should follow the earlier rations,\r\nand the mixtures given to ordinary poultry should gradually take the\r\nplace of these.\r\n\r\nOld guinea fowls have the reputation for making very tough meat. For\r\nthis reason it is better to market them while the breast bone is still\r\ntender, the claws still short and sharp, and before the crest or helmet\r\nhas reached its full size or changed colour. In young birds the helmet\r\nis nearly black, growing lighter with age.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily it is more economical when raising a few guinea fowls\r\nnot to confine them to runs, in which they are less hardy. Partial\r\nconfinement, such as coming to the barn yard to roost and appearing\r\nregularly to be fed, is more practical. If kept in runs it is necessary\r\nto cover the pens. High roosts should be provided. During the laying\r\nseason the hens are almost certain to hide their nests and need close\r\nwatching. They may lay in nest boxes if these are in dim, secluded\r\ncorners. Guinea hens are very wary and may resent having their nests\r\nvisited, by quitting. Also, the hens seem to be able to count and will\r\nusually desert their own nests if all but one or two eggs are taken\r\naway. They are rather impatient sitters, often leaving the nest when\r\nthe eggs are half incubated or when the first chick is ready to go,\r\neven though they have a dozen pipped eggs. The little ones are, like\r\nlittle turkeys, susceptible to dampness and cold. Very early and very\r\nlate hatchings are undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING TURKEYS\r\n\r\nAmong the pictures which my memory calls up is that of an old bushel\r\nbasket by the kitchen stove on a damp spring morning. From the\r\ncomforting folds of an old flannel petticoat in the depths of the\r\nbasket came the feeble \"peep-peawp\" of a dozen or more miserable little\r\nturkey chicks rescued from the shower. What a chase they had given us\r\nthrough the wet tangles of grass, weeds, and bushes, scooting to cover\r\nlike partridges, hidden by their colouring almost as effectually as\r\ntheir wild cousins. We shall never be quite sure that we got them all,\r\nfor we weren't certain how many there were originally. If the chill\r\nhad not penetrated to their vitals, and these important organs lie\r\ndisastrously near the pin-feathers, we had been in time to save them.\r\n\r\nExperiences like these impress upon the minds of farm children much\r\nthat is characteristic of the turkey. As grown-ups we read of the\r\nprecautions necessary in raising turkeys and realize that we knew all\r\nthat years ago. A turkey hen will stay close around the barn yard\r\neating and drinking with the other fowls all winter, roosting in\r\nconvenient tree tops, and giving no hint of wildness or firmness of\r\npurpose. But in April you miss her. She may return about meal time,\r\ntake a dust bath perhaps, then she is off again. Now you must test your\r\nwits against her instincts and see if you can find her nest. She may\r\nhave secreted her eggs in a perfectly safe barrel, provided with straw\r\nand cunningly secluded in the shrubbery. She is likely, though, to go\r\nfar afield and give you a merry chase. It is wise to take away the eggs\r\neach day until she has finished and wishes to sit. Then you may give\r\nher a nestful, fifteen to eighteen, or you can set the eggs under hens\r\nand when the turkey's broody spell is over she will lay again.\r\n\r\nFour weeks is the time required to hatch turkey eggs. Newly hatched\r\nturkeys are far from spry. They have no interest in food nor in the\r\nworld about them. It is forty-eight hours or even longer before they\r\nbegin to take notice. Hard-boiled eggs chopped fine is a good first\r\nmeal for them. Some growers take a pint of sweet milk in a saucepan,\r\nlet it come to a boil, and stir into it two eggs well beaten. This\r\nmakes a sort of custard and this quantity is said to be enough for\r\nfifty new turkey chicks. Cottage cheese without salt is recommended.\r\nA dusting of black pepper in the food is good for week-old turkeys,\r\nespecially in cool weather.\r\n\r\nTwo deadly enemies of little turkeys are lice and wet. These are\r\nresponsible for the high rate of mortality in flocks of all breeds.\r\nKeep them free from these by all known methods and with ordinary care\r\nin other details your profits are safe. If you tide over the first two\r\nmonths you will see the delicate chicks transformed into hardy little\r\npoults, holding their own with any kind of fowls.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any one who ever made a success of turkeys on a\r\nsmall lot. Their habit of ranging can be restrained to the extent\r\nof keeping them off the neighbours, but close cooping opposes their\r\nnatural instincts. They are great insect eaters and will pick up a\r\nfair living away from the feed trough. It is best to train them by a\r\nregular evening feeding to roost at home. You will want to count them\r\nfrequently, especially as November draws near and the price begins to\r\nsoar.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of breeds in cultivation. The biggest and perhaps\r\nthe hardiest is the bronze turkey. Some consider their flesh less\r\ndelicate than that of the smaller kinds. There is always a good market\r\nfor any size. If all your neighbours have bronze turkeys and the flocks\r\nare always getting mixed, why not try the buff or black or the white\r\nHolland? The latter are almost as beautiful an ornament to the country\r\nhome as peacocks, and can be seen at a great distance because of their\r\nbrilliant white plumage.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to get enthusiastic over turkeys let him drive through\r\na thrifty farming community in the fall and catch glimpses of the\r\nsunshine reflected from the burnished backs of the great flocks which\r\nornament every farm yard. Or, if inclined to a meal of turkey, just\r\ninquire the price on the farm or in the market, and you will decide to\r\nraise some for your own use next year, and a few to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING PEACOCKS\r\n\r\nWe have it on the authority of the curator of birds of the New York\r\nZoölogical Garden, Mr. C. William Beebe, that peafowls are not\r\ndifficult to raise if the owner is watchful. Wouldn't it be a triumph\r\nto raise a family of these wonderful birds? Mr. Beebe says also that\r\n\"peacocks are so common that we sometimes fail to appreciate their\r\nreally wonderful colours.\" I wonder if that can be true. They were so\r\nuncommon in the Mississippi Valley when I was a child that I never saw\r\none; it was less than ten years ago that I saw for the first time this\r\nregal bird spread his wonderful tail in the full sunlight. It was one\r\nof Mr. Beebe's own pets and I shall never forget nor fail to appreciate\r\nthe sight.\r\n\r\nA peahen lays fewer eggs than most birds of her size. She will lay\r\nthree times a year if you succeed in \"changing her current of thought\"\r\nwhen she is broody. She usually wishes to sit on the first six eggs and\r\nas she has pretty good judgment in placing her nest and is a patient\r\nand courageous mother, you had better trust her to bring up her family,\r\nunless you wish to raise the first lot under hens or turkey mothers.\r\n\r\nLike young turkeys, the little peachicks are very tender and\r\nsusceptible to dampness. Woe unto them if the chill of an early May\r\nrain gets into their bones! This is the time when watchfulness on the\r\nowner's part is necessary.\r\n\r\nFor newly hatched peachicks a few meals of finely chopped, hard-boiled\r\neggs and minced lettuce are right. As they develop appetites, feed some\r\nof the mixtures prepared for game, pheasants, etc. By all means let\r\nthem have space to run in; a little coop is bad for their health. Make\r\nit twelve feet long at least. They will eat quantities of insects and\r\nwill need feed only morning and evening after the first month or two.\r\nCorn, wheat, barley, and millet make a good mixture.\r\n\r\nNo regular house is required for peafowls, though shelter must be\r\nprovided against rain. They prefer to roost high, where the air is\r\nfresh and cool. Wind and cold weather they like.\r\n\r\nIndian peacocks cost twenty dollars to thirty dollars a pair. You can\r\ngrow them for far less from eggs and sell the birds. They live to be\r\ntwenty or thirty years old.\r\n\r\nIf you are convinced that you want to try your hand at any of these\r\nkinds of fancy poultry, collect all the information you can first.\r\nVisit some successful poultry plant, ask questions, take notes. Get\r\nall the government and state experiment station bulletins available.\r\nBreeders often publish information about rearing birds. They are glad\r\nto help any one who is interested. It increases their business. Write\r\nto your agricultural college for information. They may not have a\r\nbulletin on the subject, but the men in their poultry department are\r\nglad to answer questions. Giving advice is part of their business and\r\nyou can count on it being good advice.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING GEESE\r\n\r\nMarch is a good month to set goose eggs. As it takes them a little\r\nover a month to hatch, they will come out in April and the early birds\r\ncatch the best prices. It is really surprising that more farmer's boys\r\nand girls do not raise geese. They will \"board themselves\" if given a\r\nchance at pasture, but need fattening with ground grain if held for\r\nChristmas trade.\r\n\r\nGoslings can be raised under hens, six eggs in a nest, but the goose is\r\nan admirable mother. Unlike most of his feathered kindred the gander is\r\na true helpmate, often \"spelling\" his mate during the sitting period\r\nand caring for the young afterward with great solicitude.\r\n\r\nWatchful care is needed to prevent the damp, cold April from getting\r\nthe best of little goslings. They should begin their careers with a\r\nmeal of bread crumbs, scalded meal, and hard-boiled eggs, chopped\r\nvegetable tops and grass included in the mash. They eat small\r\nquantities at a time, but need it frequently to stay their stomachs.\r\n\r\nWater for drinking should be accessible, clean, and fresh always. Many\r\na sick gosling can trace his disorder directly to the bad water. A\r\nlarge tub of water for bathing, too, is advisable for geese after they\r\nare feathered.\r\n\r\nToulouse and Embden geese are tremendous creatures, even reaching the\r\nenormous weight of twenty-five pounds. Their meat is highly prized in\r\nEuropean countries and is becoming popular in America so that a good\r\nmarket is assured.\r\n\r\nThe business of fattening geese for market is quite specialized now.\r\nMen engaged in this business visit the farms where a few geese are\r\nkept and buy the eight-weeks old goslings for seventy-five cents to\r\none dollar and a half apiece. If you can get this price your profit is\r\nfair and certain and your work ended. You can put your cash into some\r\nother business. Raising geese is a good summer vacation job. On a goose\r\nfattening farm near a good Eastern city market as many as fifteen or\r\ntwenty thousand geese are fattening at one time.\r\n\r\nGeese on farms when I was a girl were kept principally for their\r\nfeathers which found their way into the pillows and feather beds then\r\nused. The best pillows in my house are filled with the feathers plucked\r\nfrom geese with which I was personally acquainted. These feathers have\r\na high market value, higher when you buy than when you sell to be sure,\r\nbut you may be able to supply a local market and thus get a better\r\nprice. Geese, like all the other feathered tribes, moult naturally in\r\nlate summer. If the live geese are to be plucked, it should be done\r\nvery carefully, three or four feathers at a time. The geese do not\r\nshow evidence of minding much when they find that your designs are\r\npeaceable. Only the breast feathers and the smallest ones from the back\r\nare ordinarily taken for home use. Avoid the feathers with coarse stiff\r\nshafts. No down should be removed. Goose quills make good toothpicks,\r\ncleaned and scalded and trimmed into shape. Or they may be sold\r\nseparately as feathers.\r\n\r\nGeese are plucked before sending to market. Most of the feathers and\r\nsome of the down now extensively used by manufacturers of bed clothing\r\ncomes from the marketed geese.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING DUCKS\r\n\r\nProbably in many neighbourhoods you would be laughed at if you tried\r\nto raise ducks without a pond or stream of water. It is not customary.\r\nTrue, if you have them for ornament principally, they look best\r\ndisporting themselves in what seems to be their natural element. But\r\nif you believe there is money in raising ducks for market, nothing is\r\neasier than to prove that the people who laughed were not up to date.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the old saying on a very wet day, \"Good weather for\r\nducks.\" Don't you believe it. If you go into duck raising you must be\r\njust as careful about ducks getting wet as you are about your chicks.\r\nThe duck must have plenty of water inside, all he will drink, but keep\r\nhim dry outside. Little ducks are hardy if kept dry and warm. Even\r\ncold drinking water will give them cramps and should be avoided. The\r\ndrinking vessels should be so covered that the duckling can get only\r\nthe bill wet.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of ducks over chicks is this: they do not bring quite so\r\nbig a price per pound, but they grow so much faster during the first\r\ntwo months of their lives. Ducks should be marketed at eight to ten\r\nweeks old. At ten weeks old a good broiler will weigh about two pounds\r\nand will sell for seventy-five cents, but a duckling will weigh four to\r\nfive pounds, which at twenty-five cents a pound will give you from one\r\ndollar to one dollar and twenty-five cents. The cost of feeding the two\r\nwill be about the same.\r\n\r\nDucks have other advantages over chickens. They are not nearly so\r\nsubject to vermin, though lice sometimes attack their heads. They seem\r\nto thrive in confinement and cost less to house than chickens. Their\r\nfeathers will bring a good price, and eggs of pure breeds for hatching\r\nare in demand. They are excellent layers, even better than some hens,\r\nas experience will show. If a duck lays nine dozen eggs at four dollars\r\na dozen, and raises a family, she does a pretty good year's work, and\r\nis more profitable to keep than some cows. She eats grubs and insects,\r\ntoo, and grass and surplus from the vegetable garden.\r\n\r\nThe commonest practice for beginners is to set duck eggs under hens in\r\nApril and May. The biggest varieties are the best to raise as all are\r\nhardy, fast growers, and good layers. The eggs take about twenty-eight\r\ndays to incubate. Treat the hen and nest for lice just as when sitting\r\non hens' eggs.\r\n\r\nWhen ducklings are twenty-four hours old, they are ready for their\r\nfirst meal. Mashed potatoes mixed with meal of corn or oats and\r\nmiddlings are good for them. Milk, too, is excellent as for all fowls.\r\nBegin to stuff them immediately; you will find them quite agreeable.\r\nGreen food of all kinds--grass, lettuce, cabbage, vegetable tops--all\r\nchopped small, fills them up and is good for them. Such things as\r\nturnips and potatoes should be cooked. Ground meat should be fed three\r\ntimes a week. Have the feeding troughs so arranged that they can get\r\ntheir shovels into it but cannot walk over the food and foul it; same\r\nthing with the water. Feed four times a day. They must not get empty.\r\nGrowth will not be rapid unless continuous. Grit should be supplied.\r\n\r\nOn duck farms one hundred ducklings are kept in brooders five by seven\r\nfeet, with yards five by sixteen feet. They are kept absolutely clean\r\nand dry. Those you keep over winter for next year's egg supply should\r\nhave access to a pond and grass. Old ducks do not bring high prices for\r\ntable use and do not put on weight very fast.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a young Boston housekeeper who asked when her market man\r\noffered her Pekin ducks for her table, \"How are they esteemed?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"Oh, my wife, she don't never steam ducks. She just stuffs\r\n'em like you would a chicken and bakes 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING SQUABS FOR MARKET\r\n\r\nA few years' experience in raising fancy pigeons for pets is the best\r\nkind of training for a young man who wants to raise squabs for market.\r\nThis business on a small scale ought not to take all one's time and\r\ncan easily be combined with some other business or profession or with\r\nattending college. But your experience, varied though it may be, has\r\nnot acquainted you with all that is worth knowing on the subject. The\r\ntime has gone by when a man can afford to ignore books and bulletins\r\neven on a subject upon which he may himself be an authority. A library\r\nof pigeon literature will increase your wisdom. A practical man writing\r\nof his experience in your business may save you hundreds of dollars\r\nif you heed his advice. Don't scoff at college bulletins as your\r\ngrandfather probably did. He had reason, but the bulletin is not what\r\nit was. Great strides forward have been made. Visit some big squab\r\nraiser's plant and take mental and written notes of significant facts\r\nobserved. The colour of his pigeon loft does not affect the price he\r\ngets for his squabs, but the quality of the grain he feeds has a direct\r\ninfluence on the fullness of his wallet.\r\n\r\nFull-blooded homers are declared by many to be the best, all things\r\nconsidered, for table use. Good, mated birds of this variety can be\r\nbought for about two dollars a pair. They are hardy, bright, active on\r\ntheir feet, and the squabs have a larger breast than some of the other\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nHomers are not all the same colour; some are white, others black,\r\nreddish, and mixed colours. Good stock will rear six or eight pairs of\r\nsquabs in a year, while some exceptionally good ones will raise ten\r\npairs. If you make a clear profit of one dollar and twenty-five cents\r\nper year on an average from each pair you should do well. It is not\r\nprofitable to keep birds which produce less than five pairs a year. A\r\nrecord must be kept in order to weed out worthless birds. You do not\r\nwish to spend your leisure running a free boarding house for pigeons.\r\nYou must know which are the big producers and keep only their young\r\nas breeders. Nests should be numbered and every bird have a leg label\r\nwith a number corresponding to a numbered description in your book of\r\nrecords. This is good economics.\r\n\r\nSquabs of homers should be ready for selling at four weeks old; they\r\nshould be fully feathered but still in the nest. The heaviest grade\r\nweigh eight pounds per dozen and these bring highest market prices.\r\nLighter birds are considered poor quality and bring a correspondingly\r\nlow price. Prices vary from four dollars and fifty cents to one dollar\r\nand seventy-five cents per dozen. Dispose of pairs which habitually\r\nproduce light-weight squabs as indicated by your records.\r\n\r\nMinute directions for killing and dressing squabs for market are given\r\nin Farmers' Bulletin No. 177, which every squab raiser should have in\r\nhis library.\r\n\r\nThere is, as yet, no indication of over-production in squab raising;\r\nalthough many more are grown every year, the demand is still on the\r\nincrease. It is a good business for two people to go into together, a\r\nbrother and sister, two brothers, or adjoining neighbours.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of house and furnishings, fly, foods and feeding, and\r\ndetails of care are given in Chapter IV under \"Raising Fancy Pigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISING PHEASANTS\r\n\r\nThe young people on a big ranch or estate with its up-to-date poultry\r\nplant, raising not only plain and fancy chickens, but pigeons, ducks,\r\ngeese, turkeys, and guinea fowl, all attended by men hired for the\r\npurpose, may look about in vain for a chance to try their hands at\r\nraising anything with feathers. To such boys and girls I say, \"Did you\r\never see any pheasants?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the Zoölogical Gardens, yes.\"\r\n\r\nAren't they beauties? How would you like to grow pheasants? There is\r\na line that has not been overworked. Profit in it, too. Look at prices\r\nyou must pay for birds and get an idea of how yours will sell later.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments in pheasant growing have been tried in this\r\ncountry. It is well to know of these and to profit by them. Some men\r\nraise many varieties, importing them from every quarter of the globe.\r\nTheir ideal is to have a complete collection. A visit to a large\r\naviary will give you some idea of what a gorgeous family of birds the\r\npheasants make. They are highly prized as game birds. In Germany they\r\nare served in a most surprising way. The edible parts are cooked and\r\narranged on a platter on a bed of parsley. At one end of the platter\r\nthe cook puts the head with its beautiful neck ruff and at the other\r\nend the tail feathers. Imagine the waiter's triumphant entrance into\r\nthe dining-room, platter held aloft, and the pheasant's brilliant tail\r\nfeathers streaming far behind like pennants from a mast top!\r\n\r\nThe pheasant most easily grown in the United States is the ringneck or\r\nMongolian pheasant imported from its home in China. There is hardly a\r\nstate in the Union where no attempt has been made to raise pheasants.\r\nIt is an industry that appeals to sportsmen everywhere. Massachusetts,\r\nOhio, New York, Indiana, Illinois, California, New Jersey, and some\r\nother states have made pheasant rearing a part of the work of their\r\nFish and Game Commissions. The state of Oregon is the only one where a\r\nremarkable success has been won. Evidently the climate and conditions\r\nthere were ideal. About three dozen pheasants were set free in the\r\nWillamette Valley in eighteen hundred and eighty-one. So rapid was the\r\nincrease that when the first open season of two and one half months\r\nwas declared eleven years later it was estimated that fifty thousand\r\nbirds were shot the first day! They have continued to increase in that\r\nstate and towards the north, and many other states get their supply for\r\npropagation from Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do after becoming interested in pheasants is to\r\nlearn something about their nature and needs and to consider whether\r\nyour conditions are such as would make the business possible or\r\nprofitable. They are not domestic fowls but more like the jungle fowl\r\nfrom which, in all likelihood, our barn yard fowls are descended. But\r\nthey can be raised in captivity if due regard is taken of their habits\r\nand characteristics. Books and bulletins are mentioned in the appendix\r\nof this book. In some respects pheasants are very like chickens, being\r\nespecially susceptible to the diseases of the poultry yard. In England,\r\npheasant rearing is quite common. One sees in open meadow land on great\r\nestates the tidy coops where anxious biddies cluck after their wayward\r\nfoster children. It is a pretty sight to see the fifteen or twenty\r\nbrown-striped birds scuttling wildly to her protecting wing at the\r\napproach of danger.\r\n\r\nPheasants' eggs for shipping should be most carefully packed in cotton,\r\nhay, or excelsior to insure safety from jar. You do not have to begin\r\nwith grown birds which cost five dollars a pair for ring-necks, as the\r\neggs are best set under hens. The eggs should be set in late April or\r\nearly May for best results. Bantams are often preferred, but any good\r\nmother will do if she is cleanly and not too clumsy. Great precautions\r\nshould be taken that the nest be clean, and that the hen should have\r\nall the comforts of home, _e. g._, a dust bath, clean water, and\r\nregular feeding. Can you afford to run the risk of young chickens\r\ngetting lice as soon as they are hatched? Well, you simply can't take\r\nany chances with baby pheasants. Hens should be dusted three times\r\nduring incubation with insect powder. Visit an aviary or a pheasantry\r\nif you can and ask questions and take observations on how to make\r\nnests, coops, and pens. Study your books, too, and be guided by the\r\nexperience of others.\r\n\r\nWhile you wait for your young pheasants to hatch there is plenty to do\r\nin preparing coops and learning what to feed them when they arrive.\r\nMuch of our lack of success in rearing all sorts of wild game is\r\nbecause we know so little about what they eat. We probably make lots of\r\nmistakes with the animals we have domesticated but the more adaptable\r\nof them have grown accustomed to civilized food, and thrive.\r\n\r\nThere could be no better place for a rearing ground for young pheasants\r\nthan an orchard where clover abounds. Coops, like chicken coops, should\r\nbe rain proof, well ventilated, bottomless, and so built that they can\r\nbe closed to keep out vermin and to shut the chicks in when the grass\r\nis wet.\r\n\r\nPheasants are omnivorous but they need more fresh animal food than\r\nis supplied by ordinary \"chick mixtures,\" to balance their ration.\r\nProbably they share with other young birds a relish for insects and\r\nwhile their mothers do not actually bring this food to the open bills\r\nof their young, they take the flock to the feeding ground and show them\r\nhow to find worms, bugs, caterpillars, etc., by scratching. There are\r\nways employed by experienced pheasant growers of raising a supply of\r\nmeal worms, maggots, and ant pupæ for their flocks, but cheap, fresh\r\nmeat ground very fine furnishes suitable animal food. During the first\r\nthree or four days after feeding is begun a custard made of ten eggs\r\nto a quart of milk, baked well, is their best food. Hard-boiled eggs\r\nfinely minced (put through a potato ricer), fine bread crumbs, and\r\nfresh vegetables cut into small bits can be given during the first\r\nweek. Later, small grains of a great variety of kinds. A sprinkle of\r\nred pepper in their food during cold, damp days is good for half-grown\r\nchicks. The young pheasants must have access to fine grit and gravel\r\nand they must have fresh, cool water all the time.\r\n\r\nIn building pens for pheasants we should take into consideration their\r\nhabits, their safety, and their lack of hardiness in domestication.\r\nSelect the site for the pens after due thought. There must be both\r\nshade and sunshine. The soil should be well drained and rich enough\r\nto grow grass and clover. Each run should be at least ten feet by ten\r\nwith netting of medium mesh for sides, eight feet high, cover of the\r\nsame. A house is an unnecessary expense, as it is pheasant nature to\r\nstay in the open or seek a covert of brush. A rain proof shed, where\r\nthey can retire when it rains, and where a dust bath will always be in\r\nreadiness, is a necessity.\r\n\r\nWild birds of prey evidently consider it perfectly legitimate to\r\nvisit pheasant runs. Raccoons, foxes, rats, and mink, too, may work\r\nruin there. The cover of netting protects from above and it may be\r\nnecessary, where burrowing animals abound, to dig a trench a foot deep\r\nand set the netting down in the ground that far. A few steel traps set\r\nunbaited along the outside of the runs may prevent a serious loss and\r\nprovide you with a handsome mink or raccoon fur skating or motoring\r\ncap. Severe cold, even storms, are not fatal to pheasants. Provide\r\nperches in the pen as well as in the shed and they will usually choose\r\nthose in the open air.\r\n\r\nBecause of their great timidity the birds should be disturbed as little\r\nas possible. Unfamiliar sights and sounds alarm and distress them.\r\nWhat a triumph it would be to induce your pheasants to eat from your\r\nhand! It can be done by exercising great patience, gentleness, and\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nAll you know about chicken raising will be useful now. Make up your\r\nmind that everything that is bad for chicks is simply fatal to young\r\npheasants; for instance, wet feet, lice, dirty, or sun-warmed water,\r\nover-feeding, wrong feeding. If you play this game you must expect a\r\nconstant succession of hazards, of narrow escapes, and losses. But it\r\nis a noble game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nRAISING ANIMALS FOR PETS\r\n\r\n\r\nSHETLAND PONIES\r\n\r\nThe perfect pet is the Shetland pony. This diminutive horse is a model\r\nof gentleness, patience, good-nature, and horse sense. One writer says\r\nof him: \"If more than eight children get on his back he will shake\r\nhimself like a wet Newfoundland dog and then stand motionless, while\r\nthey pick themselves up and out from among his four hoofs.\" So many\r\ngenerations of ponies have lived right in the family circles of their\r\ncold little island that children do not make them nervous.\r\n\r\nIs there a prettier sight than a well-groomed Shetland pony, a carriage\r\nmade in Lilliput, and a small driver, and a reasonable number of little\r\npassengers of assorted sizes? A goat team is a joke, a dog team is\r\nimpracticable, a team of young oxen is too plodding and lacks style.\r\nThe pony outfit is charming and always delights everybody. But who\r\nlikes to see a grown man in a pony carriage? A small grown person may\r\nbe necessary, especially if the baby is to be taken for a drive, but a\r\nfull-sized adult makes a pony carriage look top heavy.\r\n\r\nThe Shetland pony is a sort of \"boy horse\" so far as work is concerned.\r\n(Some say, too, that he gets out of as much work as possible.) There is\r\nno better helper at light jobs than the pony. Like the yak:\r\n\r\n    \"He will carry and fetch\r\n    You may ride on his back\r\n    Or lead him about with a string.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed he will follow his master about without a string and can carry a\r\ngood load. With a light cart or wagon suited to his build and a boy to\r\ndo the rest, one of these hardy little fellows will be of greatest help\r\nin doing the endless odd jobs that always fall to the boy's lot. The\r\npony will more than earn his board if the boy earns his.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Helen W. Cooke. The Shetland Pony is the\r\nIdeal Pet]\r\n\r\nA thoroughbred Shetland pony should be less than forty-five inches\r\nhigh and weigh less than three hundred pounds. Many are raised in this\r\ncountry. A boy is lucky who has a chance to train a pony colt. Training\r\nshould be begun early. One successful breeder says that his children\r\ndo all the training of his ponies. His boy, seven years old, broke\r\nthe first one they raised to drive to a little wagon. Little boys and\r\ngirls under ten take entire care of the ponies in another man's herd.\r\nNo doubt their father or mother oversees the work, but it is fun for\r\nthe children to groom and feed and pet these wee horses.\r\n\r\nBreeding Shetland ponies is a very practical way to make a few hundred\r\ndollars a year. They eat less than full-sized horses and will keep fat\r\non grass from frost till frost. The price of ponies is 25 per cent.\r\nhigher than it was five years ago. This makes the cost of going into\r\nthis business higher, but the sales begin the second year and selling\r\nprices are higher, too. Shetlands are hardy and require shelter only in\r\nbitter cold weather. Ponies of various sorts are becoming far commoner\r\nhere than formerly, so the demand is increasing. I wish every boy and\r\nevery girl whose heart is set on having a pony could have one. Let us\r\nall raise ponies until there are enough for every one.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS, GUINEA PIGS, AND CAVIES\r\n\r\nRabbits, guinea pigs, and cavies are not poultry, yet there is always a\r\ndepartment devoted to them in the great Poultry Show at Madison Square\r\nGarden in New York. It was there that I first made the acquaintance of\r\nthese three kinds of popular pets. Many a boy has made a neat little\r\naddition in two figures, at least, to his college fund, by raising\r\nhares, rabbits, guinea pigs, white rats, fancy mice, or cavies. Common\r\nwhite rabbits can be bought for one dollar a pair, but these days it is\r\nnot uncommon for a breeder to pay from fifteen dollars to twenty-five\r\ndollars for wearers of blue ribbons. If you had guinea pigs for sale\r\nyou would be glad that the best ones cannot be bought for less than ten\r\ndollars apiece.\r\n\r\nRabbits are the most popular of these pets, while cavies come next.\r\nThere is just now a great demand for cavies. They are odd little\r\ncreatures, neither intelligent nor affectionate. Neither are they very\r\nhardy; in the North they have to be kept indoors in cold weather.\r\n\r\nCavies are easy enough to feed, for they eat everything that is set\r\nbefore them, and keep at it all the time. All sorts of vegetables,\r\nbread and milk, and corn are the \"chief of their diet.\"\r\n\r\nBefore going into the business of raising any of these creatures it is\r\nwell to consult some other boy who has had some experience and find out\r\nif there are any peculiar difficulties he can help you provide for.\r\nMaybe your locality and conditions are better fitted for one than the\r\nother. A dealer will often be able to give you valuable information\r\nabout the different sorts of pets, and may be able to recommend the\r\nbest book on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY PIGEONS\r\n\r\nIf I were a boy or a girl to-day there is nothing I should so much like\r\nto do as to raise pigeons. Not that I think it an easy job. (Wouldn't\r\nyou almost as soon work as to look for an easy job, anyhow?) There are\r\nlots of disappointments, discouragements, and hard labour about pigeon\r\nrearing. But young folks with hobbies like this are getting more fun\r\nout of life than the idle ones.\r\n\r\nPigeons are hardy, easily tamed, prolific, and can be made to pay their\r\nown way. It would be impossible to associate with them, care for them,\r\nlearn their nature and habits, without becoming thoroughly interested\r\nin them. No pets could be more gentle, more beautiful, more docile than\r\npigeons. Success in rearing them will not be immediate, but will come\r\nwith experience.\r\n\r\nThe business of raising fancy pigeons for pets is quite distinct\r\nfrom squab raising, treated in the chapter on poultry, and is far\r\nmore likely to interest boys and girls. If you were to go to a big\r\npoultry show you would be bewildered at the number of breeds of fancy\r\npigeons. The pouters, the tumblers, the barbs, the dragoons, nuns,\r\nhelmets, the fantails, and carriers are all there in endless variety.\r\nWhat you like will be different from what I like, probably, so it is\r\nnot easy to recommend. Beginners would do well to choose some one\r\nvariety and try their hand at that before investing very extensively.\r\nThe flying tumbler is recommended by many good authorities. These are\r\nnot difficult to breed, are small eaters, do not need to be caged\r\ncontinually, and although they are to be had in nearly all the colours\r\nof the rainbow they are not very expensive. It is not good economy to\r\nbuy cheap stock, in anything. Though by getting good ones you must\r\nstart with a single pair, it is the best economy. Your increase will\r\nbe very much more valuable. You should ask the breeder for a written\r\nguarantee that the pigeons are as represented, healthy, young, mated\r\nstock. If he does not care to give the guarantee, I should not consider\r\nhim reliable.\r\n\r\nPigeons are not much influenced by elaborate dovecotes. They are\r\nquite as happy living the simple life in a dry-goods box, provided it\r\ncontains the conveniences they require, and is placed where the light\r\nwill be plentiful, the air pure, and the roof rain proof. City boys and\r\ngirls need not sigh and give up the idea because they have no place for\r\npigeons. The attic or the roof serves them just as well as the barn\r\nyard, perhaps better, as mice and rats are less likely to disturb them\r\non housetops. Every precaution should be taken however against these\r\nvermin. Cracks, doors and ventilators should be covered with fine wire\r\nnetting. Even the entrances, holes six inches high by four in width,\r\nshould be protected by tin guards which rats and mice cannot creep over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Net for capturing pigeons]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pigeon roost]\r\n\r\nEach pair of pigeons will need two nesting compartments. A good kind is\r\ndescribed in Farmers' Bulletin No. 177, and is constructed as follows:\r\nInch boards, twelve inches wide, with parallel cross cleats nailed on\r\nnine inches apart, are set upright full twelve inches apart against one\r\nwall, and securely fastened at top and bottom. Cut twelve-inch squares\r\nof inch boards for the bottoms of the nest boxes. It is easy to see\r\nhow convenient these sliding bottoms will be to clean. Provide small\r\nearthenware dishes as nests, with a foundation of tobacco stems, to\r\ndiscourage lice. The birds will build nests of straw above the tobacco\r\nstems, the male bringing the material which the female arranges to suit\r\nher ideas of house furnishing. Some growers use sawdust in the nest. If\r\nyour pigeons are allowed their liberty with no shelter save the pigeon\r\nloft, perches will be needed inside. As the pigeon's feet are formed\r\nfor perching on flat surfaces instead of on rounded branches like\r\nmany of their feathered relatives, you should provide what suits their\r\nneeds. A good form of perch is made as follows. Cut half-inch, dressed\r\nmaterial four or five inches wide into five or six-inch lengths. Nail\r\ntogether two of these pieces in v-shape. This can be nailed to a\r\nsquare foundation piece and hung angle up on the wall of the loft. The\r\nslanting sides afford no lodging for droppings and as only one bird\r\nat a time can perch on so small a place, quarrelling is avoided. Iron\r\nbrackets with perches attached are also used.\r\n\r\nTwo nest dishes are provided for each pair, as very often the hen will\r\nlay a second pair of eggs before the earliest young ones are ready to\r\nleave the nest. The male pigeon is untiring in his devotion to the\r\nyoung and their mother, taking his turn on the nest regularly during\r\nthe seventeen days of incubation, doing his share of the work, and even\r\nbeating his wife if she shows any disposition to slight her duties.\r\n\r\nIf the pigeons are confined in a wire fly, perches should be provided\r\nthere, and board walks for them to alight upon and walk about on should\r\nbe placed at a distance of four or five feet from the ground. Nothing\r\nin the shape of roosts or cross pieces should be put in the fly, as\r\nthe pigeons need all the space in which to exercise their wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fly for pigeons. Put no roosts across the fly. Flying\r\nagainst these would injure the birds]\r\n\r\nFor one hundred birds the fly should be thirty-two feet long, eight\r\nfeet high, and the entire width of the house. It will be a fine problem\r\nin practical arithmetic to figure how much netting will be required\r\nto cover the frame of this fly, how many posts, and how much one by\r\nfour-inch stuff will be needed to complete the frame. The advice\r\nof some one who has built a pigeon fly would be most valuable to\r\nthe inexperienced person, and the pictures in books, bulletins, and\r\nmagazine articles will be helpful in making your plans.\r\n\r\nHoles, at least two, rounded at the top and six inches each way,\r\nprovide for the going and coming of the birds between house and fly.\r\nFor yourself, an outside door into the fly is a necessity, of course.\r\n\r\nBefore installing your pigeons in their house, use the whitewash brush\r\nthere freely. Into each gallon of your mixture of lime and water put a\r\nhalf-teaspoonful of crude carbolic acid. Clean sand is recommended for\r\nthe floor of both fly and house. It is very bad practice to scatter\r\nfood for pigeons on the floor or ground. You will see, if you try it,\r\nhow much is wasted; any that they leave becomes soiled, moulds, or\r\nsours, and if eaten in that condition is nearly sure to injure the\r\nbirds. A shallow feeding trough should be placed near the centre of\r\nthe house. Fine charcoal, table salt, and cracked oyster shells should\r\nbe kept permanently before the birds, the boxes cleaned out at least\r\nweekly. Clean water in stone or galvanized iron fountains should always\r\nbe there, too. Daily or semi-daily is none too frequent to clean these\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nPigeons are not gluttonous feeders but \"they want what they want,\r\nwhen they want it.\" In other words, regularity is important to their\r\nwell-being. An early morning feed, six-thirty in summer, seven in\r\nwinter, of equal parts cracked corn, wheat, and peas, and an afternoon\r\nfeed, at four in summer, three in winter, of equal parts cracked corn\r\n(with no fine meal in it), kaffir corn, millet seed, and peas, is a\r\nfair ration. Pigeons like a variety but not as a steady diet. Hemp\r\nmay be substituted for millet once or twice a week; a little broken\r\nrice, green vegetable food, like lettuce and onions, will be taken\r\nsparingly, and tiny bits of fat bacon seem to be acceptable. Nothing\r\nbut first-class grain should ever be set before pigeons. The quantity\r\nneeded should be determined by watching. If food is left in trough,\r\nfeed less next time.\r\n\r\nWater for bathing is as necessary for pigeons as the dust bath is for\r\nhens. A broad galvanized iron pan three inches deep makes a first-rate\r\nbathtub. Although fancy plumbing is out of place in a pigeon house,\r\nit is the greatest convenience to have running water passing through\r\na trough constantly; this solves completely the problem of sanitary\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\nThe best fanciers clean their houses weekly. With a few birds this may\r\nnot be necessary. But when your nose gives unmistakable evidence that\r\nit is time, do not put it off. A spade to scrape the floor, an old\r\nknife for the nest boxes, and a broom are necessary utensils.\r\n\r\nMated birds will choose a nesting box after becoming accustomed to\r\ntheir new quarters. The nest pans, with their foundation of tobacco\r\nstems cut in six-inch lengths, should be in place, and a supply of\r\nshort hay or straw where it can be found. Two eggs are usually laid,\r\nwith a day between and sitting begins as soon as the second egg is laid.\r\n\r\nIf the sight of a young squab does not make you sick of your choice of\r\na hobby, you are a hopeless case, and I predict great success for you.\r\nYoung robins are not beautiful to behold, but squabs are such ghastly\r\nlooking little beasts, with nothing to recommend them except their\r\nentire helplessness. Evidently the parents are well satisfied with\r\nthe appearance of their offspring which look just as they expected,\r\nno doubt, and begin almost immediately to feed them. \"Pigeon milk\" is\r\ninjected into their open throats by the parent birds, in whose stomachs\r\nit has been manufactured. The squabs gain rapidly after a few days\r\nof this \"milk\" diet; pin-feathers replace the scanty yellow down in\r\nabout a week. At three weeks they are able to walk, but are still fed\r\nby their parents, although grain is brought to them instead of the\r\npredigested food.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are hardy, do not suppose that pigeons have no diseases.\r\nHowever, the author of a government bulletin on squab raising says that\r\nwith \"wholesome food, proper housing, and proper care, very little\r\ndisease is usually encountered.\" To prevent disease, and avoid dampness\r\nin house and fly, keep the food and water untainted, and the house\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable, whether raising squabs for market or for pets,\r\nto keep a record of the performance of each pair. This is usually done\r\nby the use of numbered tags on the birds' legs. The record makes it\r\npossible to prevent inbreeding, gives you knowledge of whether certain\r\npairs are profitable, and keeps up your own interest far more than\r\nhaphazard methods do.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANTAMS\r\n\r\nAlmost every family that keeps chickens has two or three \"banties\" for\r\nthe children. What an amusing sight it is to see a tiny fuss-budget\r\nclucking and bristling to protect a half-dozen lubberly Plymouth Rock\r\n\"broilers\" that she has been inveigled into rearing. But the raising of\r\npigmy fowls is not confined to the child's play of the chicken yard. At\r\nthe big poultry shows almost every breed of fowl from Brahma to Silkie\r\nhas a diminutive mimic, and the requirements for the dwarfs are just as\r\nrigid as for the big fellows.\r\n\r\nTo be just right a bantam ought not to weigh much over a pound, the\r\ncock should be impetuous, pugnacious, and haughty; the hen should be\r\nsmaller than her lord, and meek in demeanour except when her flock is\r\nin danger. Bantams are very popular with amateurs who regard them as a\r\nsort of joke, but the poultry fanciers take them quite seriously. It is\r\nnot unusual for the prize-winning bantams to bring as high prices as\r\nthe heavy weights.\r\n\r\nGame bantams are great favourites with fanciers. They are easily\r\nrecognized by their game-fowl characteristics: tall, upright carriage,\r\noval body tapering from shoulder to tail, very long legs and neck,\r\nsmall head, and almost no show of comb. There are eight standard\r\nvarieties in America, and the Game Bantam Club is interested in\r\nimproving the breeds and increasing the popularity of the birds.\r\n\r\nAs the varieties of bantams are pretty thoroughly mixed, it is no\r\nsimple matter to breed birds fit for exhibition. But after all there is\r\nso much fun for boys and girls in growing any sort of pigmy chickens\r\nand such a good market for both eggs and pairs for pets that I wonder\r\nthat more young people do not go into the business. Bantams take less\r\nroom than ordinary chickens which is an advantage on a small place.\r\nCare should be taken to save for setting eggs of none but the smallest\r\nand most perfect members of the flock, and to dispose of any which\r\nare larger than the standard or poor in shape or colour or in any\r\ncharacteristics peculiar to bantams. If you start with eggs of some\r\nfine breed, try to keep your stock pure, and improve it by selecting\r\nthe best individuals for breeding.\r\n\r\nIn matters of housing, feeding, cleanliness, and care, bantams should\r\nbe treated just like other chickens. The young of some varieties are\r\nexceedingly delicate and cannot stand the least neglect. These are\r\nmore like little wild things, partridges or quail, than like domestic\r\nfowls. Other varieties are as hardy as Plymouth Rocks, but any one\r\nwho has tried it knows that raising Plymouth Rocks is no mere joke,\r\nespecially in a cold, damp spring.\r\n\r\nIf your father objects to your going into the bantam business instead\r\nof raising standard size fowls bring these arguments to bear upon\r\nhim: Bantams occupy one fourth the space. Their food costs one fifth\r\nas much. Their eggs are two thirds as big. Pairs can easily be sold\r\nwithout expensive advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY FOWLS\r\n\r\nIf you want to make the neighbour boys open their eyes, and the\r\npassers-by stand still to admire, try the experiment of raising fancy\r\nfowls. Growing them for exhibition purposes is such a separate and\r\ndistinct department of the poultry business and demands familiarity\r\nwith many \"show standards,\" \"tricks of the trade,\" and special\r\npractices in breeding and grooming to bring a fowl up to a high score,\r\nthat it may be best not to undertake to compete with more experienced\r\nbreeders.\r\n\r\nA visit to a fancy poultry exhibition is like a trip to Wonderland.\r\nJust looking at the pictures of the prize winners, and studying the\r\nalluring advertisements arouses enthusiasm. But to read the accounts of\r\nthe fanciers, or to hear them talk about the merits of their favourites\r\nmakes a chicken lover fairly thrill with ardour. How to decide upon\r\nwhich variety to try is a hard problem. Take a lot of things into\r\nconsideration. Discount what the enthusiasts say about the one they\r\nhave for sale; they mean every word of it, but they are prejudiced.\r\nDon't be influenced to select one breed when you really prefer another.\r\nHere is a department where personal preference should cast the deciding\r\nvote; the one you like best is the best one for you.\r\n\r\nIt is not well known except by specialists that there are so many\r\ndistinct varieties in breeds of fowls. For example take the Polish.\r\nThere are blue Polish, plain white, golden, white-crested, black,\r\nbuff-laced, and silver; of the Hamburgs there are black, silver-and\r\ngold-spangled, silver-and golden-penciled white, and so on through the\r\nlist. The Polish and the Houdans are remarkable for their tremendous\r\ntop knots, the Hamburgs, Lakenvelders, and many others for their\r\nwonderful plumage and colour combinations, while the most astonishing\r\ncreatures in the whole chicken tribe are the Yokahamas whose snow-white\r\ntail feathers trail gracefully behind them like a bride's gown and\r\nveil at a fashionable wedding. These must be the originals of the\r\nextraordinary fowls represented on Japanese and Filipino pottery and\r\nembroidery.\r\n\r\nIt is not much wonder that fancy breeds are growing more popular in\r\nour country. Although as a rule they are non-sitters, they are all\r\ndescribed by their advocates as prize layers, some hens even reaching\r\nthe remarkable record of two hundred eggs a year.\r\n\r\nThe Hamburgs, for example, are called \"Dutch Everlasting Layers.\" Their\r\neggs are smooth and \"satiny white\"; Polish eggs are very large and\r\nsnow-white, but they are not winter layers; Houdans lay white eggs of\r\ngreat size and almost certain fertility, and are, besides, excellent\r\ntable fowls; the Lakenvelders rank with Leghorns as layers and their\r\neggs are also \"of a porcelain whiteness\" which insures a fancy market\r\nin New York where the preference is for white eggs.\r\n\r\nDo not think that you can just as well house your fancy breeds in with\r\nyour ordinary chickens. It is a mistake. They should be kept apart\r\nfrom the beginning. Light hens of commoner breeds are successfully\r\nemployed as foster-mothers for the fancy fowls, but it is important to\r\nprovide separate pens even for the young. If young chicks are kept in\r\nthe same run with those somewhat older, they are crowded away from the\r\nfeeding dishes; chicks with top knots should never be raised with other\r\nsorts. The crest interferes with their sight, and they are not fighters\r\nand will allow themselves to be driven away from the food. Crested\r\nchicks should be treated with a grease lice-destroyer at least once a\r\nfortnight. A little of the lard or sweet oil is enough but it should be\r\nworked into the feathers to be effectual. Use powder on the hens, but\r\nnot while the chicks are oily.\r\n\r\nMaking the neighbours gape in open-eyed astonishment is not all there\r\nis to raising fancy chickens. With a few years' experience in chicken\r\nraising back of you, it would not be risky to raise them for commercial\r\npurposes. The popularity of fancy chickens is just beginning in this\r\ncountry. There is a fine market for eggs for hatching, but as it is\r\nextremely important to keep the breeds pure your fancy birds should\r\nbe kept by themselves practically the year round. Most of the breeds\r\nmentioned are quite hardy, and the same care required for ordinary\r\npoultry as to housing, food, prevention of disease, cleanliness, and\r\nrecords will insure a good measure of success with fancy fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGS\r\n\r\nRaising dogs may prove a profitable business for any one who likes\r\ndogs, understands them, and is willing to doctor them when they are\r\nsick, and train them to good habits. An untrained dog is a nuisance,\r\nhowever well bred he may be.\r\n\r\nTo start a small kennel does not require any more room than to start\r\nin the chicken business in a small way. Just now the prices are so\r\nabsurdly high on high-bred dogs of popular varieties that few but\r\nfanciers can afford to own the best stock. Why is it not better to\r\nraise some first-rate but not fashionable breed, and not enter into\r\ncompetition with men whose living depends on the number of blue ribbons\r\nthey can win at dog shows? Buy a young female dog, teach her, and train\r\nher. Get experience with one dog and her young ones before you put in\r\nmuch capital. Find out by going to a good dog show what are the points\r\nof a good dog of your chosen breed, make out a score card, and mark\r\nyour own dogs. Sell for pets those which do not come up to the mark.\r\nI have before me a balance sheet made out by a young man who began\r\nraising white English bull terriers in nineteen hundred and three. In\r\nspite of a lot of bad luck, which, with better arrangements, need not\r\nhave happened, he netted nearly a hundred dollars the first year and\r\nover two hundred the second year. This young man kept chickens, too,\r\nbeside his regular business which kept him at an office seven hours a\r\nday; and he found dogs better money makers than chickens.\r\n\r\nIn raising puppies there are three important essentials: the right sort\r\nof food, fresh, clean water to drink, and exercise. I believe more dogs\r\nget sick from water or lack of it than from any other one cause. If a\r\ndog's dish is not clean enough for you to drink out of yourself, then\r\nit is not fit for your pups. Keep that in mind. Fresh air and sunshine\r\nare as necessary for puppies as for children. Kennels should be airy,\r\nface the south, and have shavings or straw bedding.\r\n\r\nAuthorities differ about a dog's food. It is safe to feed him about as\r\nyou would a growing boy. Like the boy he may overeat of his favourite\r\ndish. For breakfast, oatmeal or other cereal with milk and no sugar;\r\nfor lunch, some dry dog biscuit or stale bread; for afternoon tea, soup\r\nor gravy thickened with boiled rice or corn mush. But a puppy's supper\r\nought to be a good square meal because he is an outdoor sleeper, and it\r\nis easy for dogs to take cold on an empty stomach. For supper, then,\r\ngive the puppies some bits of cooked meat, stale bread, and gravy or\r\ncooked vegetables. \"Never feed a puppy hot bread or any rich, greasy,\r\nor highly seasoned foods. Avoid all sweets.\" Doesn't that sound like a\r\nbook on what children should eat? But it is quoted right out of a dog\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nIf your dogs get sick, eczema, distemper, or fits, consult a veterinary\r\nsurgeon. A good book on dogs and their care will be of greatest value\r\nto you for such minor troubles as dogs are heir to.\r\n\r\nFull-grown dogs do not need more than two meals a day. Most dogs are\r\nover-fed, under exercised, and are therefore unhealthy beings. Dogs eat\r\nslowly and should not be hurried. They should be fed regularly but not\r\nfussed over.\r\n\r\nA word to boys and girls who own pets: if you live cooped up on a small\r\nlot you have no right to keep a dog, much less dogs. If you have a dog\r\nand let him run at large, you will probably lose him, and you deserve\r\nto. Nobody has any right, law or no law, to allow his live stock, let\r\nthem be chickens, dogs, cats, or children, to annoy the neighbours. A\r\ndog or a cat, a rabbit, or a family of chickens can do more damage in a\r\ngarden than anybody would believe,--except the gardener. Your dog may\r\nbe worth ten dollars; he may do ten dollars' worth of damage in ten\r\ndifferent bulb beds in ten days. A thirty-cent cat can frighten away\r\nmore birds in five days than an owner can attract to his garden in a\r\nwhole season. Be fair to yourself, your neighbour, and your animals,\r\nand keep them on your own place. If you are out with your dogs, that\r\nis a different matter; if you have them trained \"to heel,\" people will\r\nwelcome you.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDFISH\r\n\r\nI have already said that the Shetland pony is the ideal pet. That is\r\ntrue still, but I should have said \"for out of doors.\" Of all the\r\ncandidates for the office of ideal indoor pet, I believe goldfish would\r\nget the most votes.\r\n\r\nThey are peaceful and innocent, their needs are few, and their manners\r\nengaging. They are attractive in colour, shape, and movements and never\r\nget under foot. Above all they have no bad habits. They neither squawk\r\nnor whistle, bark, sing, nor howl. They never stay out late nights, nor\r\nmake trouble with the neighbours. They require a minimum of attention\r\nand a minimum of expense both for quarters and for food. For developing\r\na sense of responsibility in children they serve a good purpose, and\r\nthey can even be taught. It is very evident that they have memory as\r\nwell as sight, hearing, sense of smell, touch, and taste. They easily\r\nlearn, if patiently taught, to know their master's voice and to come\r\nwhen he signals. They will learn their feeding time and place and seem\r\nto enjoy attention.\r\n\r\nJust as with horses, dogs, or elephants, the first essential in\r\nteaching goldfish is to gain their confidence. This can only be done\r\nby patience and gentleness. A restless, nervous goldfish rushing from\r\none side of the tank to another when any one approaches tells its own\r\nstory. Teased, frightened, neglected, and unhappy they are indeed in a\r\nsorry plight, for they are, even more than some other pets, utterly at\r\nthe mercy of their owners. The sooner they die and pass into oblivion,\r\nthe better!\r\n\r\nBut what a pretty sight it is to see a well-balanced aquarium, water\r\nplants spreading their delicate fronds, a clean, pebbly bottom, and\r\nbright-coloured, healthy, happy, care-free goldfish glancing in and out\r\nin the sunshine.\r\n\r\nChina is the greatest place for goldfish. Rearing them there has been\r\nreduced to a science. We find them running wild in our waters, but they\r\nare not native to America. Under ideal natural conditions they are said\r\nto live to be a hundred years old. Many are known to have lived to the\r\nage of ten years in one aquarium.\r\n\r\nGoldfish are hardy, live in sluggish streams or ponds, and eat all\r\nsorts of vegetable matter. They also eat soft-bodied insects, worms,\r\nand small fish, even their own spawn and young.\r\n\r\nFor directions for keeping goldfish happy and healthy in an aquarium\r\nin the living room of your home, I must refer you to various books and\r\narticles on aquaria and on how to make and maintain them.\r\n\r\nRaising goldfish for profit is \"a horse of quite another colour.\"\r\nGoldfish are sold by the thousand in department stores as well as in\r\nshops which deal wholly in pets. Some fish are imported, but the bulk\r\nof them are grown in this country. One of the most scientific growers\r\nin this country is Mr. Hugo Mulertt, whose book on the subject is quite\r\nenough to make its readers enthusiastic fish culturists. The best\r\nmarkets are in cities, and transportation is difficult and expensive.\r\nFancy varieties would not be in demand except in large cities.\r\n\r\nOne can begin goldfish growing in a small way at very small expense.\r\nFour tanks or reservoirs are required. Any boy who can make a hotbed\r\nframe can make these. They should be in a series: No. 1, spawning pond;\r\nNo. 2, rearing pond; No. 3, storage pond; No. 4, winter pond.\r\n\r\nWhether one makes artificial tanks or utilizes a natural valley,\r\nseparated by little dams, it is essential that the four ponds should be\r\nso fitted that they can be emptied at will. They should be sheltered\r\nfrom cold winds and from direct summer sun.\r\n\r\nThe spawning pond should be built first, and furnished with water\r\nplants as much like nature as possible. Female fish ready to spawn can\r\nbe bought from growers. These men are reliable and know how to advise\r\nyou. It is to their advantage to increase the interest in goldfish.\r\n\r\nWhile building tank No. 2, keep watch for eggs in the spawning tank.\r\nLaying begins late in April or early in May outdoors. The egg is no\r\nbigger than a pinhead, yellow, or cream-coloured. Look for them on\r\nthe plants. Snip the twigs off with great care and transfer the eggs,\r\ntwigs and all, into large candy jars in clean water; one hundred eggs\r\nis enough for a gallon jar. Be careful that the water is of the same\r\ntemperature in the jar as in the tank. Eggs should be kept not lower\r\nthan sixty degrees Fahr., and not higher than ninety degrees Fahr.\r\nThey hatch in two or three days or at most in less than a week. Do not\r\ndisturb the water. Sudden changes of temperature will kill the young\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWhen the fish are three days old, they are pretty lively and will soon\r\nbegin to need other food than that supplied by the egg. To transfer\r\nthem from the \"incubator\" to the rearing tank is a delicate operation.\r\nMr. Mulertt advises putting the tiny fish into a small, shallow,\r\n\"nursery\" tank first to make the change more gradual. The jar can be\r\nemptied very gently, fish and all, into this tank.\r\n\r\nPrepare the rearing tank, taking every precaution against enemies. It\r\nshould be covered with a screen to keep the dragon flies from laying\r\ntheir eggs in the tank. Dragon fly nymphs are death on new-hatched\r\ngoldfish. If the fish get a good start they will hold their own. Let\r\nme warn you again to take great precaution against chilling the fish.\r\nA few degrees difference may be fatal. When the fish are a week to ten\r\ndays old, they should be about a half-inch long, darting swiftly about\r\nin the nursery tank. Be sure the temperature of the water is right,\r\nthen set a wide-mouthed pail or jar full of water down in the tank with\r\nthe fish, and dip the biggest one at a time with a little hand net of\r\nsoft material. Do not crowd the fish in the transfer pail, but rather\r\nmake more frequent trips. Extremely delicate handling is absolutely\r\nnecessary. Do not dip the fish out of the jar, but put it down in the\r\nwater deep enough so they can swim out of their own accord. They are to\r\nstay a long time in the rearing pond so must not be crowded. In a tank\r\ncovering an area of one hundred and sixty square feet, two hundred to\r\nthree hundred fish can be reared. When they are only one half an inch\r\nlong, the tank looks thinly settled, but they soon grow.\r\n\r\nThe young are silver-gray at first. They usually get their permanent\r\ncolour before reaching the age of two months. In warm ponds, in sunny\r\nweather, goldfish may grow to be six inches long in the first summer,\r\nbut between two and three inches is more normal.\r\n\r\nGoldfish in outdoor rearing ponds do not require artificial feeding.\r\nNature supplies them with their natural food.\r\n\r\nThe storage tank is simply to keep the fish in while awaiting\r\npurchasers. It should be divided by partitions into small compartments.\r\nIt is convenient to sort the fish taken from the rearing tank, so that\r\nthose of one size or colour or variety can be separated and buyers\r\ncan readily see the stock. It is easier to catch them in the small\r\ntank also. In the storage tank some feeding is usually needed. Fresh,\r\ndry bread crumbs are recommended by most fish growers; feed small\r\namounts until they get used to it and until you know just how much they\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThe winter pond costs the most to build. It should be three feet or\r\nmore deep, lined with boards or cement, and located so that water\r\nwill be moving through it, in and out slowly all winter, to prevent\r\nfreezing. It should be covered during storms. Growers plan to get rid\r\nof their stock except breeders before winter sets in. One can dispense\r\nentirely with a winter tank if he can establish a house aquarium\r\nsuccessfully for wintering the fish from which he expects to obtain\r\nspawn the following spring.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected of animals which have for so many centuries\r\nbeen associated with man, goldfish have a good many diseases. Their\r\nill-health can almost invariably be traced to neglect or ignorance\r\non the part of the person upon whom they are dependent. The signs of\r\nill-health are usually quite noticeable. They are: Faded colours,\r\nbloody streaks, coated or inflamed fins, and swollen gill covers.\r\nMost of the troubles have to do with air supply. When a fish loses\r\ncolour and appetite, has a slimy coating, and acts weak and dejected,\r\nit should be put into a \"hospital\" aquarium where plenty of plants\r\nare flourishing, at a temperature of seventy to eighty degrees Fahr.\r\nOne teaspoonful of salt to each gallon of water will be good for the\r\nfish, but no food should be offered for several days. This remedy will\r\nusually restore the fish if its trouble is asphyxia or itch and has\r\nnot gone too far. In the open water conditions right themselves more\r\nreadily, but fish acting queerly should be taken out from among the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe greatest harm may result from hail storms and heavy rains on\r\nunprotected tanks. The natural enemies of goldfish inhabit the same\r\nponds and to succeed one must daily wage war against crayfish,\r\ntadpoles, salamanders, snakes, fish-eating birds, muskrats, and aquatic\r\ninsects. Toad and frog spawn found in goldfish ponds should be removed\r\nto some other pond to mature. These creatures are useful as destroyers\r\nof insects but you can dispense with them in goldfish tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A BOY'S ANIMAL CAGE\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, when I was ten years old, my father built me a house for\r\nmy animals. It is twenty feet square and ten feet high. The framework\r\nis of wood. The walls are covered with wire netting. In winter they are\r\nboarded in. Last winter we had a fire in a stove in the passageway,\r\nbut we decided that the animals were better off without it. The pen\r\ncost about one hundred and fifty dollars. I keep in it three 'coons,\r\nten to thirty rabbits, and about twenty pigeons. Two 'coons, Tom and\r\nJerry, I have had three years; the other one, Pauline, I have had two\r\nyears. My oldest rabbits, Harry and Lily, I have had six years. The\r\n'coon pens and the passageway have wooden floors. The walls of the\r\n'coon pen have double wire to prevent the 'coons from grabbing the\r\nother animals. Their pens go up to the roof of the house. The rabbit\r\npens are separated by movable wire panels six feet high. On this side\r\nof the house there is a second story for the rabbits and pigeons. This\r\nis reached by a step-ladder, and is divided by movable panels. The\r\npigeons' house is over the passageway. There are shelves with nappies\r\nin them for nests. It is open at both ends in summer. I have kept crows\r\nand white rats; they were not a success. The crows killed the rabbits,\r\nand the rats smelled bad.\r\n\r\nI feed the rabbits morning and night and water them once. Their feed\r\nis oats in the morning and hay at night. They have from two to eight\r\nlittle ones in a litter. When they multiply too fast we eat them.\r\nTheir meat is like chicken. The only way to distinguish it is by the\r\nbones. I feed and water the 'coons twice a day. They have a sort of\r\ncake made of corn meal. They grow very fat in the fall, but in the\r\nspring and summer they get very thin. They are not of any use except\r\nto look at. I did play with them until they bit my sister. Since then\r\nI have been timid about playing with them. I feed wheat to the pigeons\r\nonce a day. I have tumblers and magpie pigeons. Both kinds are great\r\nfighters. I have four ducks, also, two Mallards and two Pekins. Their\r\npen is outside of the rabbit pen. In summer I keep them shut up here.\r\nIn coldest winter weather I keep them in the barn. The rest of the year\r\nthey wander about as they please. They have a tub, which I keep filled\r\nwith water, where they can bathe. I feed them corn. They are much more\r\ninteresting pets than hens.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY OF SUCCESS WITH DOGS\r\n\r\nSome years ago two young women, one a bookkeeper, the other a\r\nstenographer, decided to exchange city for country life. Born and\r\nreared on farms, they secured seven acres of farm land, with cottage,\r\nbut sixteen miles from Chicago, and started a chicken business. This\r\ndid not prove entirely successful, mainly, as the now prosperous\r\nfarmers admit, because of ignorance and inexperience.\r\n\r\nMeantime the fine collie dog, kept as guard and companion, was bringing\r\nmany requests for good puppies, and it was determined to raise collies\r\ninstead of chickens. So Daisy Rightaway, an English champion, was\r\npurchased, later being joined by imported Master Clinker, son of the\r\nfamous Wishaw Clinker, which was brought from England about three years\r\nago by J. Pierpont Morgan at a fabulous price. Warned by the trying\r\nchicken experience, Miss Porter, who conducts the farm while Miss\r\nBenson retains her business position and looks after the \"city end\" of\r\naffairs, resolved to \"make haste slowly\" in the new direction. Few, but\r\ngood, animals were chosen, only the best of the young stock was placed\r\non the market, and if the farm books at first showed but small profits,\r\nthe upward trend, both in cash and reputation, was gratifyingly steady.\r\nWith less than four years of professional dog rearing behind them,\r\nand with all buildings, runs, etc., originally lacking, the pleased\r\nproprietors of \"Sylvan Farm\" rejoice in promising financial statistics\r\nfor the last half of that time.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago came, apparently by chance, that branch of the\r\nbusiness which has, perhaps, proved most lucrative, and which is\r\nespecially worthy of note by other women with country homes, love for\r\nand some knowledge of dogs, and a desire to make money. A friend who\r\nowned fine collies envied the splendid environment under which the\r\n\"Sylvan\" canines flourished, and asked permission to board some of his\r\nyoung puppies with \"Porter and Benson,\" to give the young women their\r\nofficial title. The dogs sent thrived remarkably, and he mentioned the\r\nmatter to other dog fanciers, and they to still others. Almost without\r\nknowing how it happened, the delighted farmers soon found themselves\r\ncaring regularly for from forty to seventy-five well bred dogs.\r\n\r\nOnly collies were at first accepted, but business and accommodations\r\nalike gradually widened until practically all kinds of dogs are now\r\nhandled, in a most progressive and hygienic manner. An isolation house\r\nfor dogs when first received or suspected of illness; heated homes\r\nfor young mothers, puppies, and lapdogs; winter houses, with shelters\r\nfor open-air exercise in bad weather; commodious separate runs--these\r\nare among the conveniences now enjoyed by the happy \"visitors\" whose\r\nowners are off for the summer or winter or are otherwise unable to care\r\nfor their cherished pets. The Desplaines River runs by the farm and a\r\npicturesque \"river run\" is much appreciated by water dogs and those\r\nenjoying an occasional frolic in cool water. Two fine cows provide\r\nfresh milk in abundance for the nursing mothers and young puppies.\r\nEvery dog, whether boarder or family resident, is personally and\r\nintimately known to Miss Porter, who takes sole care of them with the\r\naid of an intelligent boy to perform the rougher tasks.\r\n\r\nFive dollars monthly is charged for the board of healthy dogs, with\r\nspecial rates for those needing special care. The standard dietary,\r\nvaried to suit individual and class needs and varying occasions, is\r\ncomposed of soup made of meat and vegetables, meat jelly, rice, plenty\r\nof bones, and dog biscuit, with warm milk every two hours for the young\r\nmothers and puppies. The other dogs are fed twice daily--to the minute.\r\nIn this incessant, indispensable care is found the chief drawback of\r\nthe business for those fond of personal freedom, since the important\r\nduties of feeding, inspection, etc., seldom can be delegated to those\r\nnot personally interested in the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe little farm provides all the vegetables needed and some corn,\r\nbut all other food supplies must be purchased. With more ground the\r\nrecurring feed bills might be made smaller, but the labour outlay would\r\nbe correspondingly augmented. Eliminating unnecessary details, the\r\nfinancial situation for the two years in which the dog experiment has\r\nbeen successfully running stands thus:\r\n\r\n                               EXPENDED\r\n\r\n    Stock, buildings, and fences               $785\r\n    Miscellaneous expenses, labour, etc.        286\r\n    Feed                                        815\r\n    Cash on hand                                716\r\n                                             ------\r\n          Total                              $2,602\r\n\r\n                               RECEIVED\r\n\r\n    Original investment                        $400\r\n    Sale of puppies                             990\r\n    Board of dogs                             1,212\r\n                                             ------\r\n          Total                              $2,602\r\n\r\nThe balance of seven hundred and sixteen dollars does not represent a\r\nbad profit in less than three years made from an investment of four\r\nhundred dollars, and while the young farmers feel that perhaps in other\r\nlines of work such increase might have been more quickly and easily\r\nacquired, they feel that perhaps in no other field could they have\r\nreceived such high dividends of health, happiness, and independence.\r\nThe work is hard but enjoyable, while its widening scope and success\r\nbring true satisfaction. Sylvan Farm now receives dogs from, and sends\r\ndogs to, all parts of the United States, and the \"farm family\" of\r\nhigh-bred animals from time to time receives judicious addition. Some\r\nfamous canines have been raised, welcomed, and boarded, and one young\r\npuppy, born on the place, recently sold for one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWORK AND PLAY WITH TRAINED ANIMALS\r\n\r\nDAIRY COWS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the boys and girls of the farms are looking about for a big thing\r\nto do, the very best place for them to look is at their father's herd\r\nof cows. Even if it isn't a strictly dairy herd it is kept partly\r\nfor dairy purposes. Every cow demands stabling, pasture, feed, and\r\nattention. She is supposed to give value received for all this. But how\r\nmany cow owners know which cows pay their board with a bonus, which\r\nbarely keep even, and which are eating their heads off? The margin of\r\nprofit when feed is high is too small to risk feeding an unproductive\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nIf your father has not been in the habit of keeping accounts with his\r\ncows, you can make him open his eyes. You do not need ledgers and\r\ndaybooks for your simple statement of facts. Bring every animal face to\r\nface with her record. On one side of the account put the cost of what\r\nyou give each cow. On the other side what she gives in return. You\r\nwill have a page like this:\r\n\r\n_Roberta Grade Holstein 5 years_\r\n\r\n                                 DEBIT\r\n\r\n    To feed (at prices you would have to pay if you\r\n    bought it)                                  $\r\n    To stabling, estimate                       $\r\n    To care (so much an hour)                   $\r\n\r\n                                CREDIT\r\n\r\n    To milk, so many qts. at so much            $\r\n    To calf                                     $\r\n    To compost                                  $\r\n\r\nYou will have to reduce the item \"feed\" to many items, and remember\r\nthat hay produced at home is not free hay. It is worth to feed to\r\nRoberta just what you would have to pay wholesale for it if you had to\r\ngo to the feed store, minus the cost of cartage. To work this out is\r\ngood arithmetic, better than covering acres of blackboard space with\r\nexamples in \"partial payments.\" Now Roberta may give a good quantity\r\nof milk but of poor quality. At first you might think that didn't\r\nmatter; it brings just as much a quart. But does it, when your mother\r\nand sisters make it into butter, for example? Or, if you sell cream,\r\nwouldn't you want a cow whose milk tested high in butter fat? Your\r\ncustomers would, whether they bought milk or cream, I know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Julian A. Dimock. Holding a Conversation]\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls in many of the great dairying states, notably\r\nIllinois and Wisconsin and New York, are learning in school how to test\r\nmilk for the butter fat it contains and the chances are that every\r\nagricultural college in the United States is ready to instruct boys and\r\ngirls by letter in this important part of dairying. Many of them send\r\nout printed lessons giving careful directions about using the Babcock\r\ntesting apparatus, and I have seen a class of boys and girls in a\r\ncountry school testing milk from their fathers' cows.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how many cows are kept on farms purely for\r\nornament--or maybe to give the boys plenty of chores. These cows\r\nconsume as much food as good ones, but they are idlers. It isn't their\r\nfault but the farmer's. Can your father or you afford to keep money\r\ninvested in any cow that returns him less than a dollar a year over and\r\nabove the expense of feed? A good cow may cost twice as much to buy,\r\nbut a good cow will make thirty or forty dollars a year clear gain.\r\nThese figures are not guess-work but facts.\r\n\r\nSo I say again to the farm boy and girl--if you want to do a big thing\r\nfor your home place and for the neighbourhood, reform the dairy herd.\r\nKeep a record for every cow. Weigh the milk of each one separately\r\nevery day for a week, then again two months later, and so on through\r\nher milking days. Take an average of all these weights as the weekly\r\nweight of milk and multiply by the number of weeks the cow gave milk.\r\nThis will give the total number of pounds produced. Learn how to test\r\nfor butter fat. Your neighbourhood creamery tests the milk with a\r\nBabcock test and you can learn how. Persuade your father to sell all\r\nthe cows which fall below a fair standard and buy good ones. Test the\r\nmilk of the cows he thinks of buying. A poor cow often looks as well\r\nas a good one. The Illinois Experiment Station shows by tests that\r\ntwenty-five of the best cows in the state produce as much butter fat\r\nas ten hundred and twenty-one of the poorest cows, while eating only\r\none fortieth as much food, to say nothing of the stable room, the time\r\nspent in milking, etc. And a quarter of the million cows in the state\r\nof Illinois are making their owners only seventy-seven cents a year\r\napiece. Can your father afford to keep that kind of a cow?\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAN HOME MILK\r\n\r\nI know what milking is on the farm. Take it on a frosty October morning\r\nabout sun-up, when you make the cow get up from her bed so that you can\r\nstand in the \"warm spot\" to warm your feet. It gets no better from that\r\ntime on, even if you do milk in the cow stable. But the boys that do\r\nthe milking do not realize how perfectly filthy the milk often is when\r\nit gets to the house.\r\n\r\nTake a milk pail from the shelf, go down to the cow barn. There is\r\nthe cow. Throw her down an armful of hay to chew on while you milk,\r\nbrush off the stool, rub off the cow's bag with a wisp of hay if she\r\nis especially dirty, never mind your hands or the open pail, throw a\r\nstream of milk onto each palm and begin. Is there a little hay and dust\r\nin the pail? Never mind; it will strain out. When you get through, set\r\nthe pail down while you drive the cows out to pasture. To be sure,\r\nthey will raise a lot of cow-stable dust and the smell is pretty bad\r\nin there, but if you set it outside the pigs would get into it. It is\r\nnearly school time and you have other chores to do. Take it to the\r\nhouse and strain it. Mother always doubles the strainer cloth, but it\r\ntakes an awful time for it to run through that way. There, you said\r\nthe dirt would strain out, and look at it there in the cloth!\r\n\r\nThis is a cold-hearted picture of one of the chores the farm boy\r\nparticularly hates. Compare each item with your own methods and improve\r\non each. Home milk is not always clean milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sanitary milk pail]\r\n\r\nThe boy that milks ought to do a better job than this. He ought to\r\nbring clean milk into the house. How shall he do it? A clean place to\r\nmilk, a clean cow, a clean boy, and a sanitary milk pail; these four\r\nthings are within the reach of every farm that can afford a cow.\r\n\r\nI have seen a good many patent milk pails, mostly in stores, seldom on\r\nfarms. The sanitary milk pails _keep the dirt out_, they don't strain\r\nit out. Here is one described by the man who invented it for his own\r\nuse. This pail is tin, holds ten quarts or so. On one side is a spout\r\ntwo and a half inches in diameter and three inches long. The spout has\r\na tin cover like a baking powder can cover. To keep the dirt out of the\r\ntop of the pail the man bought a tin pan, just the size to fit tight\r\ninto the top of the pail. Just above the bottom of the pan on one side\r\nhe had a tinner cut eight or ten small holes, like a collander. Scald\r\nthe pail, double the strainer cloth and lay it across the top of the\r\npail. Press the pan down on the cloth till it goes down into the pail\r\ntight, taking care that the edge of the cloth comes up all round. Do\r\nall this at the house. With this pail, a clean milker can milk a clean\r\ncow in a sweet smelling place, and get clean milk. This may look like a\r\npound of prevention, but think of the tons of cure it will save.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING MILK\r\n\r\nThere are lots of boys delivering milk in towns and cities. Most of\r\nthem do their part well. But I believe they would like to do it better.\r\nDriving from one house to another is pretty dull business for a live\r\nboy and unless he has something to think about his mind wanders. Why\r\nnot put some thought on the very business he is engaged in? Does he\r\nknow what milk is? That children's lives depend upon the care he gives\r\nit? Does he know that dirt in ice and dust from streets may be deadly\r\nif they get into milk? If dust gets into that little puddle that ought\r\nnot to be on top of the bottles does he wipe it off with a dirty rag,\r\nignorant of the danger? If he thought of these things and studied out\r\ningenious ways of keeping his bottles free from dust, life would no\r\nlonger be dull but interesting. He would be well started toward good\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING PET ANIMALS\r\n\r\nTrained pets have a greater market value than those which have no\r\neducation. Parrots, for example, with nothing but their native harsh\r\nsquawk, can be bought for very little. But every word added to Polly's\r\nvocabulary can be expressed in dimes added to her price. There are very\r\nfew domesticated or tamed animals so lacking in wit that they cannot be\r\ntaught. But it takes a particular kind of patience and persistence.\r\n\r\nSome animals learn very quickly; mice for instance. One trainer has\r\ntaught them to walk the tight rope, climb ladders, swing in a trapeze,\r\npull tiny wagons, and do other little tricks.\r\n\r\nWe have all seen trained animals in shows and have marvelled at them.\r\nIt is hard to believe that they are real. It takes genius to train\r\nfleas, for example, or geese, yet these animals are tamed. Every boy\r\nhas a little spark of such genius and with use the spark would grow.\r\n\r\nDogs are about the easiest animals to train. Teach a dog first to\r\nobey. He must learn to understand just as a baby does. How long does\r\nit take a baby to learn what \"no, no\" means? A bright dog will learn\r\nto \"charge\" about as quickly. When he knows what you mean and that\r\nyou really do mean it and are not fooling, he will suit the action\r\nto the word or signal. A little training every day will do the\r\nbusiness. Rewards in the form of food or caresses appeal to the dog's\r\nunderstanding. Never forget to give the reward. You may sometimes have\r\nto punish a dog, but you should be careful to make certain that he\r\nassociates the punishment with the crime. Whipping a dog to \"get even\"\r\nwith him is not the way to make him a good dog. He may take his chance\r\nto \"get even\" some day. Do you blame him?\r\n\r\nMost children expect a dog to learn too fast. For instance, a boy\r\nwants his dog to draw a wagon or sled. The dog is big and strong and\r\nthere are leaves to be gathered or kindling to be brought in. Don't\r\nmake a harness, force it onto the dog, hitch him up regardless of his\r\nprotests, and expect him to trot off like a pony. Ponies are trained to\r\nthe feel of the harness from their youth up. Your dog will rebel, not\r\nangrily, but none the less emphatically. He will lie down or slip the\r\nharness or otherwise rid himself of the burden. Or he will balk. Train\r\nhim gradually, just as you would a colt or calf. He will learn faster\r\nthan either.\r\n\r\nDogs are sometimes trained to carry baskets or bundles and can even be\r\ntrusted to go on errands alone, if, by going over the same route daily,\r\ntheir minds are impressed sufficiently.\r\n\r\nTraining a dog should begin in puppyhood. Make commands in single\r\nwords and accompany the word with a sign. Use always the same easily\r\ninterpreted sign with the command word. Teach him his name first, then\r\nto come when called. After these commands are thoroughly learned, teach\r\nhim to come \"to heel,\" \"charge,\" and similar commands. A poor teacher\r\nwill make a poor dog, so teach yourself patience. Your voice should be\r\nfirm but never loud or high-pitched.\r\n\r\nA young dog will learn to herd cattle, sheep, or goats more easily from\r\nan old dog than from you. He will follow his leader at first, then\r\nlater he can go on ahead driving the herd on his own responsibility or\r\nin obedience to a command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by George G. McLean. Gyp Has An Ax to Grind]\r\n\r\nDid you try to teach your dog to retrieve by ducking him? How silly!\r\nHow soon would you learn to swim by that method? Begin by letting\r\nhim think he is bringing you his play-ball, although really you are\r\npulling it by an attached string. Insist on his giving up the ball\r\nevery time. Do it again and again till he is out of the primer class.\r\nThrow the ball a few feet at first, then farther and farther away till\r\nhe has that trick \"down fine.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the water is well warmed by the spring sunshine, take him to the\r\nshore and repeat the same lessons patiently, a little each day. If you\r\nhave an old retriever with you the youngster will be ambitious to \"go\r\nhim one better\" and will learn more quickly.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in training dogs to consider the inborn instincts of\r\nthe breed. A terrier is a \"nat'ral ratter\" and needs little training\r\nfor that, but you would have to train a long time to get a spaniel to\r\ncatch rats.\r\n\r\nA dog on the farm can be trained to save the boys a lot of steps. We\r\nhad a shepherd dog once which was a famous runner. When my father\r\nsuspected that the cattle were breaking into the cornfield, he would go\r\nfirst to the top of the knoll by the house, hold Nimp up in his arms,\r\npoint in the direction of the cows. Nimp would whimper and squirm and\r\nwhen let down was off like a streak of brown lightning. He would not\r\ngo in a bee-line, but followed first the road, then the line fence\r\nto where the marauding cattle were at work. By the time my father\r\nor one of the boys on horseback reached the break in the fence the\r\nfleet-footed dog would be hustling those cows. If he didn't actually\r\nget them back into pasture he kept them moving so that they got no more\r\ngreen corn than was good for them. \"Good old dog\" was all Nimp expected\r\nfor little deeds of kindness like this. He wagged his head, hung out\r\nhis long pink tongue, and almost smiled with satisfaction. There was no\r\ndoubt that he was pleased with having outwitted the cows, for which he\r\nhad small respect.\r\n\r\nTeaching a collie to herd sheep or goats is a special sort of business;\r\nexperienced shepherds can teach you how it is done. Training hunting\r\ndogs is also a work for experts. Anybody knows that a poorly trained\r\ndog makes the difference between real sport and disgusting failure. A\r\nyoung man with a real aptitude for training dogs for various forms of\r\nhunting can find opportunities to turn this genius into cash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING YOUNG HORSES\r\n\r\n\"Breaking colts\" is a phrase handed down to us, I think, from the days\r\nway back when our pioneer ancestors used to go out and catch a wild\r\nhorse and break it to saddle and harness. On ranches where colts range\r\nover vast areas and never get acquainted with human beings except at\r\nbranding time, it is little wonder that they must be broken. They do a\r\nlittle breaking on their own account, too. But on the small farm where\r\nthree or four colts a year or fewer are raised, no colt should need to\r\nbe \"broken.\" All should be trained, which is one way of saying taught\r\nor educated.\r\n\r\nEverything depends upon the colt's learning each thing right first.\r\nIf you put an old, worn strap on him, or a fraying rope which he can\r\nbreak, he will just as likely as not become a halter and bridle breaker.\r\n\r\nA little colt starts out without any habits. All the bad ones as well\r\nas all the good ones are learned. Every bad habit harks right back to\r\nsome mistake. You can manufacture balky horses by overloading a wagon\r\nfor your team of colts. I have seen boys tease a colt \"just to see him\r\nkick.\" That strikes me as lacking in \"horse sense.\"\r\n\r\nEvery time you go out with your father to visit the two-year-olds and\r\nthe yearlings, be sure that you pet and caress them. Don't attempt to\r\nmount one till you have accustomed him to the feel of a burden on his\r\nback, a very small weight first, then the saddle of an old harness,\r\nthen a very light saddle. Don't act as if you were in desperate need\r\nof a saddle horse. His training cannot all be done in one visit. A\r\nyearling must be taught to lead, then to be driven.\r\n\r\nAfter a two-year old has been accustomed to the feel of a harness,\r\none part at a time, he can safely be hitched with some old stager to\r\na light wagon, and taught what pulling means. He should already know\r\nthat a pull on the right rein means \"gee\" and on the left means \"haw\";\r\nnever give the command \"whoa\" to a colt, unless you have the muscle\r\nto make your command good. A runaway may not break any harness, nor\r\nany vehicle, nor any bones, _this_ time, but a runaway horse is an\r\nill-trained horse.\r\n\r\nIt is almost an impossible thing to train an old, high-spirited horse\r\nto regard an automobile or a trolley car with anything but disfavour. A\r\nyoung horse can learn easily. Soon after a colt is well \"halter-broke\"\r\nhe should be led around where the farm machinery is at work. He must\r\nbe held with a strong hand and not be allowed to bolt when the mowing\r\nmachine starts. Break the automobile to him gently. Lead him up to\r\na quiet one. Have a bit of his favourite dainty to offer him from\r\nthe seat and see to it that he is convinced that the automobile is\r\nharmless. (Would that it were true!) Speak reassuringly to him. If he\r\njerks back, don't get mad and whack him, just to vent your impatience.\r\nHe will associate your whack with the automobile, and you will\r\nhave your work to do over again. I have known of a colt being made\r\n\"trolley-wise\" in an hour and he never has forgotten; he would no more\r\nshy when one whirls by than he would at his own mother hitched to a\r\nload of hay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREADMILLS AND CRANKS\r\n\r\nHow a boy does hate the sight of a crank. Turning the grindstone,\r\nrunning the washing machine and churning are part of a country boy's\r\ndaily life. He may do these things cheerfully, because he knows they\r\nare boys' jobs or because he hates to see his mother doing them even\r\nworse than he hates doing them himself. But that doesn't prove that the\r\nboy's tastes run to crank turning.\r\n\r\nWhy not train a dog or a sheep to turn the crank? That's a scheme. It's\r\nfun to train an animal and then it will be more fun to see him do the\r\nwork while you read a book and watch him.\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of a big wheel from which a belt runs to a\r\ngrindstone out under a tree. In the wheel stands a good dog; by his\r\nbright eyes, his erect carriage, and the \"near-smile\" on his face, you\r\ncan see that he is no brow-beaten labourer. A man at the grindstone\r\nholds the axe and the wheel is ready to turn. This fine dog knows that\r\na certain signal means work. He does not skulk off and hide, nor yawn\r\nand look limp. He steps up into the wheel, waits for the signal, then\r\nbegins a steady tread. On Mondays he does the washing, on Tuesdays and\r\nFridays he churns, on other days he helps grind the axe, the sickle,\r\nthe scythe, or the butcher knife. When the job is done, at a well-known\r\nsignal, the dog stops, steps off the wheel, and waits for the kindly\r\npat of his mistress or the \"Good old fellow\" of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING ANIMALS HAPPY\r\n\r\nIn training any domestic animal you will find their greatest weakness\r\nis fear, just as with wild animals. You do not want to develop this\r\nbut to win their confidence. With horses taken right from the range or\r\nwild, the men who are most successful are those who train by kindness.\r\nA horse whose spirit is broken and who does his task because he is\r\nafraid not to is not a safe horse. I wouldn't trust him in an\r\nemergency. A horse who lives in a state of fear has very little sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Julian A. Dimock. A Group of Happy Farm\r\nAnimals]\r\n\r\nOne blow, yell, jerk, or even a threatening motion will often\r\nobliterate all the work you have done. So the animal trainer must not\r\nlose his temper, especially with dogs and horses. The more intelligent\r\nthe animal, the more kindness and gentleness are required. On one farm,\r\nyou will see the calves trembling when coming for their food, trying to\r\nkeep one eye out for sudden blows while drinking; the horses jerking\r\ntimidly up as if expecting their tender mouths to be yanked; the cows\r\nkicking the milkers; the colts hard to toll in from pastures; the dog\r\nwith tail between his legs; the cat on her way up a tree. Do you know\r\nthe owners of such animals? How are the boys of the family liked in the\r\nneighbourhood? Are the girls popular and good-natured? Has the mother\r\nthe sweet and patient look that the best mothers have?\r\n\r\nEvery domestic animal ought to be kept happy. A happy hen will lay\r\neggs, a happy cat will purr and rub your leg in passing, not because\r\nshe wants anything out of you, but because she thinks you are a good\r\nfellow and that's her way of expressing herself; she will catch mice\r\nfor you, too. A happy cow will give down her milk; a happy pig will lay\r\non fat faster than a miserable one, a happy horse will almost trot at\r\nthe plough. So really it pays to keep animals happy. Having creature\r\ncomforts alone is not enough for most animals. They like attention,\r\ncaresses, and even seem to enjoy and understand conversation.\r\n\r\nBoys that train animals will find that the animals train them. If you\r\nhave a hot temper and can keep it in enough to train a dog to draw a\r\nwagon, you will find it isn't so hard to hold in when you are playing\r\nball. Self-control is one of the biggest things in life.\r\n\r\nThe training of a calf or colt should begin early, just as with other\r\nanimals. If the animal has never been frightened the task is easy.\r\nBegin gradually. Petting for a day or two will get him used to being\r\nhandled. A rope may be knotted round his neck and worn for a day or\r\ntwo, or a rope halter put over the head; something that slips on\r\neasily so that you don't have to hold the youngster's head. When he\r\nis accustomed to the feel of the halter, you can lead him to his food\r\nwithout his realizing it. Unconsciously he gets used to the pull on the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nA pair of well-matched oxen, trained by kindness, taught to \"gee\"\r\nand \"haw\" at the word without reins or goad, with no bad habits like\r\nkicking or turning in the yoke, are worth between two and three\r\nhundred dollars. They started out worth four or five dollars a head\r\nfor veal. Training and grass have done most of the rest. If trained\r\nin kindness, they are docile, gentle, industrious, and though less\r\nspirited than horses, they are also steadier and far better suited to\r\nmany heavy farm tasks than horses. The harness for oxen is very simple,\r\ncosts little, and seldom needs mending.\r\n\r\nEvery county fair ought to offer prizes for animals trained by boys and\r\ngirls. I believe boys train animals more often than girls do. I wonder\r\nhow that comes. Practise on the hens, girls, and on the cat. I know of\r\na cat which picks up nuts and puts them in a basket quite as a child\r\nmight. This cat treads a wheel, too, to turn the churn.\r\n\r\nIf all the animals were happy and earned their living, helping do the\r\nwork, as well as reproducing their kind, farm life would be less dreary\r\nand hardships would seem less hard and the country would be a better\r\nplace to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMING WILD ANIMALS\r\n\r\nAll little children are interested in animals. It does not take much\r\nargument to convince a boy that he needs a dog or the girl that she\r\nneeds a canary bird. If, as they grow older, they seem to lose their\r\npleasure in the companionship of animals, it means that something is\r\nwrong. Probably home conditions are such that an intimate acquaintance\r\nwith any animal is inconvenient or else some unnatural lessons in\r\nnatural history have been forced upon the children at school and their\r\ninterest in the real things has been deadened. I have heard many boys\r\nand girls say that they dislike zoölogy. Take these same boys and girls\r\nout on an excursion, with an opera glass or with an insect net, or show\r\nthem a rabbit's tracks in the new snow, and who will say they are not\r\nawake and interested?\r\n\r\nThe first thing you want to know about an animal is its name. The\r\nsame is true of a new neighbour or a new schoolmate. The name does\r\nnot tell you much about the animal or the boy. When you know them\r\nbetter you will give them names that fit. The new boy's name may be\r\nReginald. When the boys get to know him they may call him \"Piggy,\" or\r\n\"Chief,\" depending on what kind of a boy he is. But a name is a great\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nNext after the name you want to know where he lives, how he lives, and\r\nabove all what he can do. After all \"what he can do\" is the boy, and\r\nthe same is true of other animals.\r\n\r\nHow are boys and girls going to find out what animals can do, how they\r\nlive, how they make a living?\r\n\r\nThe good old natural way to find out what an animal can do and will\r\ndo is to catch him and watch him. Some small neighbours of mine did\r\nnot catch grasshoppers and throw them into the water because they were\r\ncruel, although their mother berated them for cruelty. They wanted to\r\nfind out whether grasshoppers could swim or not. The boys who catch\r\nsquirrels and rabbits and birds and put them in cages want to take care\r\nof them and teach them tricks.\r\n\r\nBut, seeing the wild ones unhappy and drooping, most boys will\r\nvoluntarily let them go. There is no good word to be said for the\r\npractice of caging wild creatures merely for the entertainment their\r\nmisery will afford an irresponsible and curious crowd. I am glad to\r\nknow that those horrid whirling cages in which squirrels used to be\r\nshut have become less common.\r\n\r\nIn these days of hunting without guns, there is also a good deal of\r\ntaming without cages. This is the real thing, and has everything in\r\nits favour. There are two sides to it. From the animal's side the\r\ntamed one has nothing to lose. He, and for his sake, all his fellows,\r\nreceive protection, consideration, care. If he tells any secrets, his\r\nconfidence is not betrayed to the enemy. He comes and goes at will and\r\npays his debts by keeping true that balance which existed in nature\r\nbefore mankind upset it. From the human side taming wild things is a\r\ndelightful though not an easy way to learn to be patient, persevering,\r\nand gentle. You simply have to practise these virtues or you will fail.\r\nFurthermore, the domestication of wild animals useful to man results in\r\nvery great practical value. From the naturalist's point of view, this\r\nis a most fruitful method of discovering the true habits of the wild\r\ncreatures, about which so much is yet to be learned.\r\n\r\nMost efforts to tame full-grown animals result in complete failure.\r\nTaken when young, almost any of them can be tamed.\r\n\r\nNo one ought ever to have a pet of any kind unless he sees one thing\r\nclearly: Forcing his pet to become dependent upon his protection and\r\ncare involves a real responsibility. When I consider the number of\r\ncases of neglected pets I am inclined to discourage children from\r\nkeeping them. It is a very good method of developing responsibility,\r\nbut, if the method fails, the innocent pet suffers. The uncaged pet has\r\nan advantage over the caged one in that he can, if neglected, return\r\nto the wild and shift for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nA great many famous people have made friends with our native birds.\r\nJohn Burroughs could depend on an audience of robins to perch on his\r\nknee. They would listen politely while he remonstrated with them for\r\nstealing his grapes, well assured that the next forkful of earth he\r\nturned would yield worms enough to repay them for waiting. It is not\r\nuncommon to see photographs of birds perching on the hands of children\r\nor grown people. One noted naturalist is pictured with a piece of bread\r\nin his mouth, out of which a bird is taking a bite. To really tame a\r\nfull-grown bird is practically impossible. To gain its confidence is\r\ndifficult. It means that the person has never in its presence made a\r\nmotion sufficiently sudden to startle the timid creature nor lost his\r\npatience or self-control once during many trials. A bird is not tamed\r\nin an hour nor a day. A quick wave of the arm or a sharp noise is\r\nenough to undo all that has been accomplished in long, patient hours\r\nspent in establishing friendly relations. The photographs are records\r\nof triumphs.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hodge encourages the taming of young birds in the interest\r\nof increasing our valuable bird life. He says: \"It is a rare lesson\r\nin gentleness to capture a young bird without frightening it, but,\r\nif successfully done, your bird is practically tame. If even a young\r\nbird is caught after a severe chase, it is likely to be days, weeks,\r\nand even months, before the effects of its fright can be obliterated.\r\nIf they can be picked up without frightening them, they will often\r\nimmediately perch on the finger and feed from the hand. I have tested\r\nthis with young vireos, chipping sparrows, orioles, grackles, and\r\nrepeatedly with young robins, which some even put down in their books\r\nas untamable. Think what a monster the open hand must seem to a bird!\"\r\n\r\nThose of you who have read Mrs. Stratton-Porter's story of Freckles\r\nwill remember how he tamed the wild birds. They were residents of the\r\ngreat primeval woodland and had not learned yet from sad experience to\r\nhide from men. They swarmed about the gentle Irish lad because he had\r\nmade himself a part of the forest. To them he was like some new kind\r\nof beneficent tree, yielding nuts for the nut-eaters, grain for the\r\ngrain-eaters, and bits of suet or scraps of meat for all who came for\r\nit. He called them all, \"Me chickens.\" Was there anything wonderful in\r\nthis? Yes; so thought the Scotch woodsman with whom Freckles lived.\r\nAnd no, because anybody can do the same who will follow the same\r\ntactics. If you read on in the story, you will readily believe that\r\nhis relations with the birds and the forest helped make Freckles the\r\nlovable boy and the fine, sweet-natured man he grew up to be.\r\n\r\nHow to do something toward domesticating wild birds in order to make\r\nthe country a better place to live in is treated more fully in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nHumming-birds are said to be entirely without fear if tamed when\r\nnestlings. They sometimes fall from the nest and are, of course,\r\nhelpless so far as feeding themselves is concerned. They will take\r\nsweetened water from a spoon, but should not be expected to thrive\r\non this diet alone. Their natural food while growing, and probably\r\nafterward, too, is largely insects. A supply of these should be given\r\nthe young birds. They become very tame and perch on the hand and on\r\nthe flowers in vases. They will visit your best hat, too, if it has\r\nflowers on it, and will even try to collect nectar from the flowers on\r\nwall-paper or curtains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOADS AND THEIR KIN\r\n\r\nOne is really surprised at the long list of wild animals that have been\r\nsuccessfully tamed. That is, they are sufficiently tame to come to the\r\ntamer, eat from his hand, nestle in his pocket, follow him about--in\r\nshort, to show perfect confidence and little or no fear.\r\n\r\nThe toad for example, \"ugly and venomous,\" (we have Shakespeare's word\r\nfor that, but he was mistaken)--, a very useful animal and absolutely\r\nwithout disagreeable traits. It has been carefully estimated that every\r\ntoad is worth twenty dollars to the garden he lives in. Yet how seldom\r\none hears of a tame toad. At best they are tolerated, but not often\r\nencouraged by protection or by a little attention. To tame a toad, one\r\nonly needs to feed him. Frogs, salamanders, newts, snakes, turtles, and\r\nfish have all been tamed in the same fashion. As nearly all are insect\r\neaters, we are benefiting mankind when we encourage them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Charles W. Miller. The Crow May Be Tamed\r\nWhen Young]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Chester K. Reed. The Skunk is an Amiable\r\nand Well-Mannered Pet]\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUIRRELS\r\n\r\nTame squirrels are amusing. It takes very little encouragement to\r\nmake them tame enough to eat from the hand and even to rummage the\r\npockets for nuts. I remember a case when the red squirrels made so\r\nfree with the books in a great man's study that he became positively\r\nannoyed, although he had himself encouraged them and had enjoyed\r\ntheir friendliness and tameness. The case got so bad that he was\r\nforced either to vacate or to get rid of the squirrels. He finally\r\nhad a trap set. The first squirrel that came in ran straight into the\r\ntrap. The great man had really not counted on any such circumstance.\r\nHe was nonplussed. In all his diplomatic career no such a situation\r\nhad arisen. He gave the matter earnest thought. He considered all the\r\n_pros_ and _cons_. He weighed all the evidence. The squirrel was guilty!\r\n\r\nWhen asked by a friend what penalty he pronounced, the great man\r\nreplied: \"I read him such a lecture as he will never forget--and turned\r\nhim loose!\"\r\n\r\nThe relations of the red squirrel with the birds are such that we are\r\npretty sure they should be discouraged. They are, alas! egg-suckers and\r\nnest-robbers. The gray squirrel has not been caught in this nefarious\r\noccupation. If plenty of nuts, fruit, and water were supplied for red\r\nsquirrels, maybe they could be cured of their bad habits.\r\n\r\nThe flying squirrel is to me the most beautiful member of his family.\r\nHe is said to tame easily, but I remember the only pair we ever caught\r\nwere shut in a convenient closet \"till morning.\" When morning came\r\nthere were only a little pile of gnawings and a hole under the door to\r\ntell the story. They had flown, nor could I blame them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACCOONS, WOODCHUCKS, AND SKUNKS\r\n\r\nA raccoon is a most satisfactory pet and will afford about as much\r\namusement in the back yard as a cage of monkeys. Raccoons are more\r\nnumerous, especially in New England, than formerly. They are extremely\r\nfond of green corn, but corn in any form is eaten greedily. Also, I\r\nregret to say, they are nest-robbers. In fact, they will eat fish,\r\nflesh, and fowl, as well as vegetables and insects. This makes the food\r\nproblem for a pet 'coon a very simple one. But we can not afford to\r\nencourage them, because of their bird-eating habits.\r\n\r\nSometimes a hunter finds a suckling 'coon in the woods. He cannot let\r\nthe helpless thing starve, as it certainly would if left. When he gets\r\nit home, he will realize that its natural food is 'coon's milk. Some\r\nbright member of the family will suggest that a bottle of cow's milk\r\nwith rubber nipple will do the trick. Having no such convenience as a\r\nrubber nipple, we once successfully brought up a baby pig on a bottle.\r\nWe took a goose quill and wrapped it with a strip of clean old cotton\r\ncloth till we made a stopper for the bottle. This was fine, and I\r\ncan recommend it for suckling lambs, pigs, fawns, 'coons, and other\r\nyoung mammals. There are well-authenticated stories of baby 'coons\r\nbeing adopted by cats whose young have been \"disposed of.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by E. S. Kane. A Bottle Baby]\r\n\r\nA 'coon is a most mischievous creature, and if you tame one you should\r\nreally not expect your mother to feel all the enthusiasm you do about\r\nhim, for his mischief is sometimes exasperating. An animal enclosure\r\nin the back yard may be necessary, but that means more work for you to\r\nkeep the 'coon and his mates happy.\r\n\r\nTame woodchucks are said by experienced boys to be a great success.\r\nYoung ones are easy to capture, for they are not allowed to \"hang\r\naround\" the home nest after the parents decide that they are big enough\r\nto earn their own way. In \"American Animals\" there is a good story of a\r\ntame 'chuck for which the author traded an old fish line with a broken\r\nhook and thirteen cents \"to boot.\" This little chap was brought up by\r\nhand and developed most interesting traits. He made life miserable for\r\nthe family tabbies by nipping their heels, and he tunnelled under the\r\ndoor step till he made the earth cave in. A wild woodchuck will show\r\nfight when in danger of capture, but the tamed ones are not vicious.\r\n\r\nThe last creature I should ever think of becoming familiar with is\r\nthe skunk. Yet I have a photograph of a lady feeding a full-sized one\r\nfrom her hand. The account that went with the picture said that this\r\nskunk was in \"perfectly good working order,\" too. Several naturalists\r\nhave tamed these little animals, and there is no doubt that they make\r\namusing and well-behaved pets.\r\n\r\nPrairie dogs, chipmunks, badgers, fawns, 'possums, crows, and many\r\nother native wild animals have been successfully tamed. You may have\r\nread of \"Red\" Saunders's pets, the bob-cat, the snake, and Judge, the\r\nhawk. Whether you would call them tame or not depends. They certainly\r\nhad \"wild, wild ways,\" though they frequented the kitchen and slept\r\nunder the stove, one at a time. The same methods must be employed, no\r\nmatter what the creature is. Gentleness, patience, and common sense\r\nwill succeed almost every time with young animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMAKING BROOKS AND SPRINGS USEFUL\r\n\r\nRECLAIMING A TROUT STREAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I used to ketch trout that 'ud weigh two pound in that little crick\r\nback of my pasture when I 'uz a boy.\"\r\n\r\nWho has not heard old men say that? They seem to have just accepted\r\nthe lack of trout as one other piece of bad luck, like wormy apples,\r\nblighted wheat, and other dispensations of Providence. The younger\r\ngeneration are not satisfied with this view. If good wheat can be\r\ngrown by modern methods, and wormy apples prevented by spraying, why\r\nshouldn't trout be caught in grandpa's old brook? No reason in the\r\nworld. In between you and grandpa there was a generation of neglect.\r\nYour father and his brothers probably went to town to seek their\r\nfortunes. Anyhow, everybody was too busy to fish, and something went\r\nwrong with the brook that needs to be righted.\r\n\r\nAny stream that has been a trout stream once can be so again, provided\r\nthat the water is not fed with poisoned drainage from some mill\r\nor factory. If the forest has been removed and natural conditions\r\nso changed that the brook that used to be perennial is now only\r\nsemi-annual, going dry in time of drought, it will be necessary to\r\nbuild a series of dams to make sure that the water will always be deep\r\nenough for trout. A spring-fed brook is best; it is cool and constant.\r\nLower the channel by digging where refuse has choked the natural course\r\nof the stream, but don't tidy it up enough to make it artificial.\r\n\r\nThe ideal brook, and the country is full of them, has gravelly or sandy\r\nstretches which serve as spawning beds, swift rapids where exercise\r\nis necessary, and deep pools for rest and quiet, shallow places where\r\ninsects lurk in the overhanging vegetation, and once in a great while a\r\nreal little waterfall where the water gets well churned and mixed with\r\nair. The brook ought to supply enough food for all, but I have seen\r\nfish so plentiful in well-cared-for streams that it was necessary to\r\nfeed them. We would take great pans of specially prepared food to the\r\nwater's edge; as we threw it broadcast on the surface the trout would\r\nleap entirely out of the water in their eagerness to get the morsels.\r\nWe did not feed them liver because the epicure does not like his trout\r\nto have a liver flavour. The natural food of the trout should be\r\nencouraged to breed in the trout stream. You can restock your stream\r\nwith the little crustaceans, insect nymphs, and similar fish food\r\nfrom other streams if you think it necessary. A few pails full of mud\r\ncarried across will start them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Helen W. Cooke. Plenty of Trout in This\r\nStream When Grandfather Was a Boy]\r\n\r\nThe greatest necessity is to protect your fish from their natural\r\nenemies. Big fish will eat little fish, trout will eat trout, so will\r\nbass, pickerel, and suckers. You can keep the big fish out by screening\r\nthe spillway at the upper dam.\r\n\r\nThere is good fun to be had in raising trout from the egg. This\r\nwork has been regarded by most people as too complicated and too\r\ndifficult for any but an expert. As a matter of fact, it is no more\r\ndifficult than many of the occupations boys engage in, chicken\r\nraising, bee-keeping, and photography, for instance. Visit a fish\r\nhatchery if you have one near, get all the government bulletins on the\r\nsubject, and, if you have available running water, you can try your\r\nhand at trout growing. It would not appeal to many, but it is really\r\nfascinating work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGS FOR TROUT CULTURE\r\n\r\nIf there are constant, cold springs on your place, you are neglecting\r\na golden opportunity for earning money in an easy and delightful way.\r\nA spring is capable of furnishing living room for a large family of\r\ntrout. You can sell live trout at sixty-five cents to a dollar a pound\r\nto a first-class hotel. The big fish bring the smaller prices per\r\npound, those weighing from half a pound to a pound being most popular.\r\n\r\nClean out your spring first and make a basin ten to twenty feet square,\r\nthe bigger the better. Put a fine, galvanized iron netting over the\r\noverflow of your reservoir. Young fish can be bought from a fish\r\nhatchery in the form of eggs, fry, fingerlings, yearlings, or even\r\nlarger. The government will stock your streams for you free, but it\r\nimposes certain conditions, which is quite just and proper. Get all the\r\ninformation you can from state fish hatcheries or the United States\r\nBureau of Fisheries, before you decide finally.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECLAIMING A SPRING\r\n\r\nThere is often a neighbourhood tradition concerning a wonderful\r\nspring somewhere near, a spring that never ceases to flow, no matter\r\nhow complete the drought. The water is pure, cold, and clear; maybe\r\nthe oldest inhabitant had it from his grandfather how the Indians\r\nused always to camp near it on their cross-country marches from the\r\nCatskills to the Blue Ridge. They call it \"The Old Indian Spring.\"\r\nSometimes they tell hair-raising tales of midnight adventures and\r\nhair-breadth escapes, till you wonder that the spring itself never\r\nturned red with the spilt blood. From stories of early pioneer days\r\none gets a good idea of the very great importance of the ever faithful\r\nspring. With the certainty of a pure water supply for family and\r\nbeasts, a man might safely carve a home in a primeval forest. Without\r\nit, he must push on yet another lap toward the wilderness.\r\n\r\nI remember such a spring. Generations of red men, trekking from one\r\nhunting-ground to another or maybe waging their own peculiar war in the\r\nenemy's country, have depended on this spring for their success. Later\r\ngenerations of pioneers have passed that way and refreshed themselves\r\nwith its sweet water. As years went by, the spring fell into disuse\r\nand gushed on forgotten. But forty years ago it was re-discovered by a\r\nsearching party, identified as an historic spot, reclaimed, and made\r\npermanently useful and beautiful by public spirit.\r\n\r\nNobody knows just how to appreciate a spring except the person who\r\ndiscovers it, reclaims it, and makes it do his bidding. No bit of his\r\nown ingenuity pleases the householder quite as much as his spring,\r\nhis piping, his reservoir, and his little hydraulic ram, yet one of\r\nthe last springs I visited was in a New England pasture. Its only\r\nprotection was a sort of fence of poles to keep the cattle out. To\r\napproach it you had to leap from hillock to hillock, in constant danger\r\nof losing your balance and sinking in a deep mud hole. The spring\r\nbubbled up clear as crystal in a most unromantic hole in the ground;\r\nits overflow simply spread out on the ground between the hummocks. It\r\ndidn't look thrifty to me. Two days' work would have laid a basin rim\r\nof small stones about that spring with a piece of tile for an overflow\r\npipe, and a shallow channel might have been dug to carry the surplus\r\nto the edge of the slope where another basin for the cattle might have\r\nbeen made, or to a trough.\r\n\r\nThe water of a spring ought to be analyzed by a chemist before it is\r\nused for drinking. Nobody knows what contamination is possible to a\r\nspring whose sources are mystery. Campers ought to be particularly\r\ncareful in this, especially if their camp is near settlements.\r\n\r\nThe first step in reclaiming a spring is to dig out a basin. The\r\nchances are that the one made by the water is too shallow for practical\r\npurposes. Compute the number of gallons you want in reserve and take\r\nout enough cubic feet of soil to make a basin of that capacity. Decide\r\nnext what to do with the surplus. Your basin is not designed to hold\r\nthe spring's daily output. If the spring is in a ravine, nothing is\r\nsimpler than to lay a tile drain from the basin down to the stream bed.\r\nBy damming the stream you can make a pond for waterfowl, for trout\r\nraising, or for a swimming hole: but that is another story.\r\n\r\nThe basin should have a protecting rim. For a number of reasons this\r\nshould be solid and permanent. You are sure to want to sit on it and\r\nwatch the water, for one thing. Then, too, you want a protection\r\nagainst surface water. All sorts of decaying animal and vegetable\r\nmatter must be kept out of the spring, so cover it tightly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING A SWIMMING POOL\r\n\r\nIn a country where wooded brooks are plentiful there is absolutely no\r\ngood reason why boys shouldn't have a swimming pool. It needn't cost\r\na thousand dollars, either. Every outdoor club ought to have one as a\r\nspecial feature. The same dam that holds back the water for the skating\r\npond may serve in summer to make the swimming hole. It is really fun to\r\nbuild a dam. Your father or the other boy's father will know how. You\r\ncan dig out the stream at low water, and make the pool deep enough for\r\ndiving.\r\n\r\nHigh banks make the place more private; trees and underbrush serve the\r\nsame purpose. But if the banks are not high naturally, and the trees\r\nhave been cut away you have no idea how quickly you can make a natural\r\nscreen. Willows love the margin of streams and they grow tremendously.\r\nA frame of poles covered with wild cucumber or morning glory will make\r\na good screen the first season while the permanent trees and shrubs\r\nare growing. You don't need to swim all your spare time, so you can\r\ngive some time to making the pool more secluded. Move a few big bushes\r\nfrom the woods in winter. They will never know the difference if you\r\ntransplant them while their roots are frozen in a big ball of earth.\r\n\r\nLet me make a suggestion to you. You believe everybody ought to know\r\nhow to swim, don't you? That includes your father, of course, who\r\ntaught you. Does it include your sisters and the other boys' sisters?\r\n\"Everybody\" is a big word, now you think of it. Why it includes even\r\nyour mother! Do mothers know anything about swimming? Some of them do,\r\nalready, only they never get a chance to keep in practice; but they\r\nlike it. It is precisely as natural for girls and mothers to enjoy\r\nthe water as it is for boys and fathers. Just be generous and let it\r\nbe understood that a certain day in the week is ladies' day, and turn\r\nthe pool over to them. Their bathing suits may not be in the latest\r\nfashion, but you won't be there to criticize nor to see how well they\r\nreally swim.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOME-MADE SKATING POND\r\n\r\nThe family who own a tennis court and enjoy no skating in the winter\r\nhave their own want of ingenuity to blame, if they live in the Jack\r\nFrost belt. Any level piece of ground, even the grass plot in the back\r\nyard, can be skated on.\r\n\r\nYou need first to set a six-inch board on edge all round the level\r\nplot. This board should be three inches in the ground and three inches\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAs winter approaches, rig a trough from the pump to the pond-to-be or\r\nhave the hose where it can be attached to the spigot at a moment's\r\nnotice. Wait for a hard freeze. When it comes, and the ground is like\r\nrock, give the word \"all hands to the pumps.\" Let on enough water to\r\ncover the surface, then let it freeze. If you get a smooth surface the\r\nfirst go you are luckier than most boys. Cover the first coat with a\r\nsecond and that with a third layer until you have smooth ice.\r\n\r\nThen skate. On cold nights spray the worn places if you use a hose, or\r\nrun on another half-inch of water.\r\n\r\nA good skating pond can be made by boys with a little ingenuity, which\r\nin this case means engineering ability, by damming a brook until it\r\nfloods a naturally flat area above its own level. Or by damming the\r\noutlet of a pond before dry weather comes on and holding the water at a\r\nhigher level than it would naturally have. It is perfectly astonishing\r\nwhat a small dam will do, if cleverly placed. Study the work of beavers\r\nif you know of any. You can get pointers from mill-dams built by your\r\ngreat-grandsires, if there are any in your vicinity. In one of the\r\nbooks for boys, mentioned in the book list, are practical suggestions\r\nabout building dams.\r\n\r\nSometimes boys think nature has not done as much for them as for boys\r\nwho have a natural swimming pool, a skating pond, or a trout brook.\r\nMaybe if you helped her out a little, nature would do her part in your\r\ncase, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF RECLAIMING A SPRING\r\n\r\nWhen I was fourteen years old my father bought his property in Ithaca,\r\nN. Y., on which we live. That part of it on which there is now a\r\nfine spring was considered worthless. Through this property ran a\r\nwell-wooded glen, the upper end of which was very wet and swampy. This\r\ncondition was due to several small springs emerging from the ground\r\nat the head of the glen. All of these springs joined and flowed down\r\nthrough the glen, forming a fairly large stream. This stream flowed\r\ncontinually throughout summer and winter, without change of volume.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the reclaiming of this spring was to collect all\r\nthe water through tile drains into a large, concrete reservoir. This\r\nreservoir, which was four feet wide, four feet high, and twelve feet\r\nlong, was constructed about two feet under ground. An open spring basin\r\nwas connected with this reservoir by a two and one-half inch iron pipe.\r\nThis basin was made of rough stones laid in cement, and the back side\r\nof it arched over a foot or more, forming a partial roof. On the open\r\nside is a concrete seat where one can conveniently sit and get a drink.\r\nMy father and I did all the work except part of the ditch digging. From\r\nthis basin was laid a one and a quarter-inch iron pipe which carried\r\nthe water down the glen a distance of about sixty feet to a hydraulic\r\nram. This ram is always running, and is made to go by the constant\r\npressure of the water from the spring basin. The water is forced\r\nthrough a half-inch iron pipe to a large tank in the attic of the house\r\nsituated on the hill above. The tank, which holds about five hundred\r\ngallons, supplies the house with pure, cold water for all purposes.\r\nAs the water is always flowing into the tank it is provided with an\r\ninch and a half overflow pipe, which carries the surplus water back\r\ninto the glen. Thus, through a series of pipes and a ram, the water is\r\nconveyed from the reservoir throughout the house. By building a small\r\ndam farther down, we made a fair-sized pond on which to domesticate\r\nsome wild fowl.\r\n\r\nThe ground drained by concentrating the springs was well adapted\r\nbecause of its fertility for the growing of shrubbery and flowers\r\nof many sorts. In the wetter places, ferns and pink and yellow lady\r\nslippers were planted, and in the dryer area shrubbery, such as the red\r\nbud and azalea. Thus, what was once a mud hole was transformed into a\r\nuseful piece of ground.\r\n\r\n                                                           JOHN NEEDHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nA BACK YARD SWIMMING POOL\r\n\r\nSomewhere and somehow our boys came into possession of the idea that\r\nthey could make a swimming pool. I think the original suggestion came\r\nfrom _Country Life in America_, wherein was described, with beautiful\r\npictures, a swimming pool that cost five thousand dollars or six\r\nthousand dollars. The boys had land a-plenty, water, too, and a will\r\nto work if they were shown what to do. With the decision made that a\r\nswimming pool must be had, a council was held to decide on ways and\r\nmeans. The oldest boy, aged thirteen, stoutly maintained that he could\r\ndo the entire work himself, while the youngest, aged four, was equally\r\nconfident that the job was entirely within his capacity. It was finally\r\nagreed that I should stake out the ground and furnish the material, and\r\nthe boys would do the work. With some slight modifications this plan\r\nwas followed throughout. It was decided to make the pool twenty-five\r\nfeet long, ten feet wide, and four feet deep. The ground was thereupon\r\nstaked off and the boys fell to with a will removing the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was hard digging, but the youngsters stuck to the work and finished\r\nwithin a week. Earth to the depth of three feet was removed, and by\r\npiling this around the entire margin of the excavation the level was\r\nraised about one and one half feet for a distance of eight feet on all\r\nsides. This plan avoided the necessity of hauling away the earth, gave\r\nthe desired depth, and provided a flat surface eight feet wide all\r\naround the pool.\r\n\r\nThe rough digging being finished, the sides of the excavation were\r\ntrimmed with a spade to an angle of about forty-five degrees. Rough two\r\nby four-inch studding was then cut into lengths of four and one half\r\nfeet and placed four feet apart all around the banks. Where each piece\r\nof studding was set, the earth was removed, so that the timber was made\r\nflush with the soil. The end of each piece of timber was also sunk in\r\nthe earth at the bottom of the pit for about three inches, in order\r\nthat it might be held firmly against the bank. Rough pine boards, free\r\nfrom cracks and knot holes, were then nailed to the timbers at the top\r\nonly. These boards were twelve inches wide, and thus formed a border\r\nor rim all around the upper portion of the pit, one foot in width. At\r\nright angles to the twelve-inch rough boards others of the same size\r\nwere nailed, the last projecting out on the level ground, thus forming\r\na boardwalk around the excavation. The main object of these boards was\r\nto keep the waves from washing the banks and to give a clean place upon\r\nwhich to stand or sit while not actually in the water.\r\n\r\nThe boards being up, there was still left about three feet of the\r\nsides, and the entire bottom of the excavation, without covering of\r\nany kind. It was decided to cover the sides and bottom with cement,\r\nplastering this material directly upon the earth. The cement was mixed\r\nwith sand, one part cement and two parts of sand, and was spread on\r\nwith a mason's trowel. Two and a half barrels of cement and about four\r\nbarrels of sand were used. Toward the last, pure cement was applied as\r\na thin wash to the entire surface.\r\n\r\nThe cementing was a pretty tough job, but with the help of an old\r\ncoloured man the work was finally done in a thorough manner, and the\r\npit was then as tight as a jug. It was allowed to dry for two days;\r\nthen the water was turned in. The water was supplied from the service\r\npipe of our home near by, and as it is furnished by meter, we had no\r\nqualms as to the quantity used. The pool holds about eight thousand\r\ngallons and requires from twelve to fifteen hours to fill it through a\r\nthree-quarter inch pipe.\r\n\r\nThe entire cost of the work, not counting the boys' time, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    12     boards, 1 × 12 × 16                     $2.25\r\n     8     pieces rough pine, 2 × 4 × 16            1.05\r\n     2½    barrels cement at $1.50 per barrel       3.75\r\n                                                  ------\r\n            Total                                  $7.05\r\n\r\nThe pool was located in the shade of some willows on ground slightly\r\nhigher than the adjacent territory. Every few days some of the water\r\nwas siphoned off through a piece of hose and fresh water run in. Once\r\na week, however, about a handful of copper sulphate was tied up in a\r\npiece of cheese cloth and thrown into the pool, where it was whipped\r\nup and down in the general fun until all the copper was dissolved. The\r\ncopper kept the water absolutely pure and sweet throughout the entire\r\nseason, and not a sign of algæ appeared.\r\n\r\nThe pool was a source of constant delight, not only to our youngsters,\r\nbut to those of our neighbours. All but the four-year-old learned to\r\nswim, and by the end of the season even he could make some preliminary\r\nmoves in that direction. The moral of the story is that if you have\r\nsome youngsters, a back yard and a city water pipe you do not need to\r\ngo to the seashore for fun. Give the boys a chance to make a swimming\r\npool and they will enjoy it all the more if it is the result of their\r\nhandiwork.\r\n\r\n                                                    BEVERLY T. GALLOWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nKEEPING BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nI picked up a number of the _Bee-Keeper's Review_ one day and my eye\r\ncaught this surprising headline:\r\n\r\n\"A BOY'S BUSINESS WORTH $1000\"\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and read on in astonishment about a boy who started\r\nwith no more capital than any boy could get together, and, without\r\nsacrificing his school or college plans, built up a bee business which\r\nhe sold for one thousand dollars. In the meantime his bees had not only\r\npaid their own board but his as well. If one boy can make a success\r\nlike that, other boys can. So can girls, for bee-keeping is a form of\r\noutdoor work which seems admirably suited to sensible, nature-loving\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BEGIN\r\n\r\nThere are a good many ways to begin this like any other business, but\r\nthere is probably a _best_ way for each person. Fortunately one does\r\nnot have to begin on a large scale. In my opinion the only way to learn\r\nhow to keep bees right is to keep them. Experienced bee-keepers advise\r\nyoung people to visit a practical apiary and watch the owner among his\r\nbees, taking note of what he does and says. Offer your services if he\r\nneeds help, asking him to explain what he is doing and what for. Stay a\r\nfew days or a week if he will keep you and learn all you can. One young\r\nwoman spent a summer vacation on a farm where twenty or thirty colonies\r\nof bees were kept, and helped whenever anything was to be done with the\r\nbees. When she went home she took a colony of bees with her, and now\r\nshe is manager of her own apiary with a larger income than the average\r\nteacher and ten times the leisure.\r\n\r\nFor beginners the cheaper bees are satisfactory. Later, nothing will\r\nbe too good. A stand of bees can be bought for two dollars or three\r\ndollars, but a colony of choice Italians in a modern hive with tested\r\nqueen may come as high as fifteen dollars. Better have them to sell\r\nthan to buy at that price.\r\n\r\nThere are cheaper ways of getting them than buying them. If a runaway\r\nswarm which no owner claims, alights in your yard the bees may be\r\nyours by right of discovery and if you hive them successfully, by\r\nright of possession. This method though practised by some has not the\r\nsanction of the golden rule, and is not here recommended. What fun\r\nit would be, though, to secure a runaway swarm and make the visitors\r\ncomfortable in a temporary hive. You would probably find they belonged\r\nin the apiary nearest you and ten to one the owner would just as\r\nsoon you kept them unless they were a very choice kind. He will be\r\nso pleased that you were able to hive them that he will offer you\r\nsomething substantial for your work. He may give you the bees, and your\r\nbee-keeping will begin \"by accident\" as did the life-work of the famous\r\nveteran apiarist, Mr. A. I. Root.\r\n\r\nMake a small beginning. Many successful bee-keepers had less than\r\ntwenty dollars to begin with. One colony is a start. It is astonishing\r\nhow quickly bees begin to \"pay their way\" and this test ought to\r\nbe applied in all your ventures. Keep a strict account of all your\r\nexpenditures in supplies, and credit the bees with all the honey you\r\ntake off and with the new swarms. If I say this often, it is because it\r\nmust be repeated to fix its importance in the mind. If you make good\r\ninterest on your money you know it is safely invested. If, however,\r\nyou charge up your time against the bees you must credit them with the\r\nfun you have, the outdoor exercise you get in caring for them and the\r\nconsequent freedom from doctor bills.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST PLACE FOR BEES\r\n\r\nYou will read of keeping bees on a city roof, in a suburban attic,\r\nand on boats; but the most natural place for them is in the village\r\nor country, where fields of clover, groves of basswood, and patches\r\nof buckwheat abound. An orchard or large garden is incomplete without\r\na few hives. The young bee-keeper with these advantages is to be\r\ncongratulated; the conditions are ideal. All he needs is a liking for\r\nbees and spunk.\r\n\r\nBefore you get the first colony decide where your apiary is to be\r\nlocated. Even one hive must have a place and you must plan for\r\nincrease. An orchard is a fine place, and the hives should be at least\r\nfifty feet from the street or road, because bees do not recognize the\r\nlaws of the open road and turn neither to the right nor to the left. If\r\nnecessary to put them next the street or close to a neighbour's garden,\r\nthere should be tall bushes, a hedge, or a high fence to protect the\r\npassers-by. Otherwise your venture into bee culture may make you \"bad\r\nfriends\" with the neighbours and even carry you before the justice of\r\nthe peace.\r\n\r\nIn very hot weather some shade is necessary for beehives, but too much\r\nshade may result in failure. The morning sun and the late afternoon\r\nsun are good for bees, but the heat of the mid-day sun may cause the\r\ncomb to melt and bring disaster to bees young and old. As moving the\r\nactive colonies is not always safe, it pays to make a plan in the\r\nbeginning for the whole number you expect to have. This is a case where\r\nit is justifiable to \"count your chickens before they are hatched.\" It\r\nwill not take much imagination to draw a plan on paper locating the\r\nprincipal objects in and near the apiary-to-be, and to sketch in the\r\nlocation of the ten, fifteen, or twenty hives you are likely to have\r\nfive years from now. If you have no large, deciduous trees to offer\r\nideal shade you needn't give up the idea of keeping bees. With the\r\nmodern ventilated covers, bees are successfully kept out in the sun, if\r\nprotected from wind and storms. A grape arbour affords good protection.\r\nIt should run from east to west. Any trellis with quick growing vines\r\nlike hops, Virginia creeper, or grapes, will serve well. Grapes give\r\nbest return as they bear fruit and their blossoms supply honey in\r\nseason. Where no natural shade is possible a shade board or air-spaced\r\ncover supplies the lack. A shade board can be made of any old box\r\nmaterial. Lay a couple of sticks across the top of the hive to rest the\r\nshade board on and to let the air circulate.\r\n\r\nWind is worse for bees than too much sun. Bless the pioneers of\r\nthe windy country if, by reason of their forethought, you have a\r\nreal evergreen windbreak on your place. If you have not this ideal\r\nwindbreak, a building will serve, or your hedge or high board fence\r\nshould be on the windy side.\r\n\r\nIf you start, as many have, with one or two colonies let them face the\r\nsouth or east and leave space enough between the hives to run a lawn\r\nmower. As your number increases, your original plan may be changed, but\r\nit always pays to make the plan.\r\n\r\nTry to consider, in the arrangement of the hives, not only convenience\r\nbut beauty. If a board fence is necessary, train vines to cover its\r\nbare ugliness; a fringe of low shrubs will help make it beautiful. As\r\nyour apiary grows, experience will teach you how to group the hives to\r\nget the best results. Twenty hives grouped in fives under the north\r\nside of four big, spreading apple trees would be the ideal I would set\r\nfor myself if the orchard was ready for occupancy. If I began at the\r\nage of fourteen years, I could easily reach this ideal in six years\r\nand keep my other duties up, too. By that time I should know whether\r\nI wanted to be a bee-keeper or not. A great many people find that the\r\nchicken business combines well with some other business or profession.\r\nIt is surprising that more people do not consider bee-keeping in the\r\nsame way. Barring accidents, bees are far easier to handle, cleaner,\r\nand they board themselves. You can leave them over Sunday without any\r\nqualms of conscience and without arranging with somebody to feed and\r\nwater them. The bees will not get out and scratch up your garden or\r\nyour neighbour's, but they will do work in the garden that is too fine\r\nfor your hands to tackle, and your crops will be bigger because of\r\ntheir visits. Chicken owners always sleep with one ear open, expecting\r\nnight prowlers to appear and carry off their best stock. But who ever\r\nheard of a burglar alarm on a beehive? There are honey thieves, but\r\nthey are not common.\r\n\r\nBeehives look best on a carpet of grass, but if you have to be away\r\nduring much of the summer wide rough boards should be placed in front\r\nof the entrance to the hives to keep the grass down. A bee is likely to\r\ncome home heavily laden and pretty well fagged out with a long flight.\r\nIf she should settle in a tangle of grass she would be likely to give\r\nup the struggle and fail to answer to roll call the next morning. Keep\r\nthe grass short in front of the hives, then, if you have to cut it with\r\nshears, which is not as dangerous as it sounds, once you get used to\r\nit. This is best done on cold or wet days when few bees are going in\r\nand out. Salt, ashes, or gravel may be sprinkled close up to the hives\r\nto kill the grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUYING BEES\r\n\r\nEven the people with bees to sell advise beginners to buy from some one\r\nin their neighbourhood. It is not safe, though, to move bees less than\r\na mile and a half as they are likely to return to their old location.\r\nBuy from an up-to-date apiary if you can, and get standard hives;\r\nthe old box hives are not worth anything; neither are fancy hives of\r\ncomplicated structure. The entrance to the hive should be closed with\r\nwire cloth after the bees all get home in the early evening. If closed\r\nin the middle of the day you are cheated. In warm weather the cover\r\nshould be taken off; in its place should be put the super over which\r\nwire-cloth has been tacked. Strips of wood can be nailed on top of this\r\nto which the cover can be fastened. By this arrangement ventilation\r\nis secured. We once lost a colony shipped by express without any\r\nprovision for the circulation of air. Night is the best time to move\r\nthe bees, though it can be done in the daytime; a cold day is best.\r\nRemove the wire cloth the first night after placing in permanent\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nSpring is the best season to buy your first colony. The price may be\r\nhigher but the risk is less. Get a strong colony that has wintered\r\nwell, which contains, on the average, twenty-five thousand to\r\nthirty-five thousand worker bees.\r\n\r\nIt would be well just here for the beginner to get acquainted with the\r\nopinions of the best bee-keepers about the kinds of bees. There are\r\nvarieties among bees as well as among hens, pigeons, dogs, and horses.\r\nAmericans like to be \"hail, fellow, well met\" with all their live\r\nstock, and although even the best tempered bee might resent a cordial\r\nslap on the flank, there are bee-lovers who tell of stroking their\r\nlittle winged friends with a grass stem. It requires real sympathy to\r\nsucceed with bees just as it does with chickens or cows. No one can\r\nwork long with them without becoming intensely interested. Most people\r\nlearn to love them and find absorbing occupation in studying their ways.\r\n\r\nTwo races of hive bees are common here, though none are native:\r\nGerman, or black, and Italian. All the books and magazines as\r\nwell as bee-lovers unhesitatingly recommend the latter as the more\r\ngood-tempered, being at the same time hardy, prolific, and industrious.\r\nGood hybrids, that is, a mixture of black and Italian blood, may do\r\nalmost as well as pure stock, but pure-bred queens are a necessity to\r\nkeep the grade up. When you hear of people who gather bees by handfuls\r\ninto aprons or baskets you may be sure that those concerned are all\r\nthoroughbreds.\r\n\r\nIf there are no bees for sale near by, the best plan is to order from a\r\ndealer in the spring what is known as a nucleus. This is a very small\r\ncolony, about a quart of bees (three thousand two hundred), should\r\nbe accompanied by a tested queen, and housed in a modern hive with\r\nthree frames of comb. The queen sets to work laying eggs in the cells,\r\nnew frames should be added as needed, and if pollen and nectar are\r\nplentiful the hive will soon be full of busy young workers. By fall the\r\nframes should be stored with the honey needed for the winter.\r\n\r\nYour first expense after securing a colony will not be for \"mixed\r\ngrain\" or \"middlings,\" but for a smoker, a bee veil and gloves, extra\r\nhives for your swarms, honey sections, and other supplies. Don't buy\r\neverything that looks useful or is highly recommended by the salesman.\r\nMaybe he never saw a bee. Sometimes an old spoon or other cheap utensil\r\ncan be made into a more useful tool than the one he wants fifty cents\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe following list includes the supplies you are pretty sure to need\r\nthe first year:\r\n\r\nOne colony of bees, in an up-to-date though simply constructed hive.\r\nOn the whole, the ten-frame hive seems to me to have advantages over\r\na smaller one. A deep telescope cover gives room for two supers on\r\ntop at once. The only advantage in the chaff hives seems to be that\r\nwinter protection is not needed for bees housed in them. The obvious\r\ndisadvantage is their greater cost, size, and weight. Single walled\r\nhives are so easily made weatherproof, (see Wintering) that the expense\r\nof the chaff hive is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThree extra hives.\r\n\r\nTwo supers; four super covers.\r\n\r\nTwo to five hundred section boxes for comb honey. You will not need\r\nvery many of these the first year, but they come cheaper in larger lots.\r\n\r\nOne smoker. Of the several kinds offered, you may safely choose the one\r\nthat you have seen used successfully.\r\n\r\nOne pair bee gloves; one bee veil.\r\n\r\nOne pound brood foundation, for the new swarms to begin on.\r\n\r\nTwo pounds thin super-foundation for starters in the honey sections.\r\n\r\nOne foundation fastener. One experienced bee-keeper tells me that he\r\nlikes the \"Dewey\" best. Others prefer the \"Daisy.\"\r\n\r\nOne Porter bee escape.\r\n\r\nOne bee brush.\r\n\r\nOne queen and drone trap. The new Alley trap is made with bars instead\r\nof perforated zinc, and works better.\r\n\r\nA bee-keeper's guide. (See list of books in the appendix.)\r\n\r\nComplete directions for putting together the hives, etc., should\r\naccompany the filled order, and the novice should work with one eye on\r\nthe printed page. A good book on bee-keeping should be included in the\r\nbeginner's order. Those recommended in the book list in the appendix\r\nare all good books for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES AS WAGE EARNERS\r\n\r\nAverage American boys and girls are a pretty sensible crowd and they\r\ndon't expect to get much for nothing. If they make money they like to\r\nsee \"for value received\" written on it. They may get enthusiastic over\r\nthe work they undertake, but there is a difference between enthusiasm\r\nand gush. Enthusiasm helps you do the hard part of your job. Gush only\r\nmakes you ridiculous. Is there anything worth doing that doesn't take\r\ntime and work? The honey-producing business is no exception. But the\r\npeople who keep bees like their job. \"Yes,\" they say, \"it takes thought\r\nand energy and some hard work, but it is _such fun_.\" The \"little\r\npeople\" are so interesting that you forget that it is work. Compared\r\nto \"butter money,\" \"egg money,\" and \"fruit money,\" the women of the\r\nhousehold regard \"honey money\" as \"easy.\"\r\n\r\nHow much can you count on your bees earning? General statements will\r\ngive you some idea. You may do better or not so well as the average. A\r\ngood colony ought to turn out thirty or forty pounds of comb honey a\r\nyear beside what they need for winter, which is fifteen or twenty-five\r\npounds if wintered in a cellar, twenty-five or thirty-five pounds if\r\nwintered outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe best market for honey is the home market, and the price is the\r\nbest. You get the commission man's profit and the retailer's profit as\r\nwell as the grower's. The last honey I bought was twenty-five cents\r\na pound. If I bought your thirty pounds at that price you can see for\r\nyourself what you would get per hive. The new swarms add to your assets\r\nand you are out nothing except for supplies. Compare this with the\r\nexpense of going into chicken or squab raising. The following is quoted\r\nfrom a good authority: \"Two dollars a year clear profit per hive is the\r\nvery lowest estimate and twenty to thirty hives infringe very little on\r\none's time. This many colonies may easily be managed by a woman or by\r\nthe younger members of the family.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States has to import two and a half million pounds of honey\r\nannually, and a half million pounds of beeswax. Will not our bees\r\nwork just as cheaply as those in foreign countries? Let us have more\r\nbee-keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVES\r\n\r\nLittle flat-topped white houses varying in height, standing under the\r\ntrees in back yards are not an unfamiliar sight to most of us. We say\r\nas we pass on the road, \"Those people keep bees,\" and our mouths begin\r\nto water. But what do the hives look like inside? They are not mere\r\nhollow boxes. Wild bees are content with a hollow tree, but modern\r\ndomesticated bees require a special kind of furniture.\r\n\r\nThe first eaters of honey were simply robbers of the wild bees. When\r\nman began to domesticate bees, and that was so long ago that we cannot\r\nstop to count the centuries, there came to be two sides to the bargain.\r\nIn return for a share in their stores he kept them in clean quarters,\r\nprovided abundant pasture, protected them from their enemies and from\r\nthe weather. The old-fashioned hives were very picturesque affairs; you\r\nsee them in pictures, and when you travel in Europe you may see them\r\nstill in use. Those skeps do not encourage doing much with the bees\r\nor knowing what is going on in the dark hive. I wonder how the folks\r\never got any honey to eat. The modern bee-keeper wants to open his hive\r\nfor a good many reasons. He not only wants honey when the bees have an\r\nover-supply, but he wants to know what is doing. He wants to know if\r\nhis expensive queen is doing her duty; he wants to know if too many\r\nyoung queens are being developed; he wants to know if any diseases or\r\nother enemies are present. He therefore must have a hive that permits\r\nfrequent and minute inspection of its interior.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said one boy, \"I don't intend to open my hives and get stung all\r\nover.\" Now who expects to get stung all over? There's no denying that\r\nbees sometimes sting, cats often scratch, dogs sometimes bite, goats\r\nbutt, cows hook, horses kick, and so on. Some method of self-defence\r\nis their right, and I doubt if we should find bees so interesting if\r\nthey did not carry concealed weapons. We certainly respect their rights\r\nas we might not if they were defenceless. A bee sting is uncomfortable\r\nwhile it lasts, but people afraid of bees get very little sympathy from\r\nme. Rest assured that you will open your hives often and the less said\r\nabout being stung the better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern hive, showing parts in their correct order]\r\n\r\nIf possible examine at a dealer's or at some apiary an empty hive.\r\nLearn the uses and names of the parts. The bottom board represents the\r\nfoundation, the brood chamber is the living room, and the supers are\r\nthe attic store rooms. The flat cover is the rain-proof roof. The hive\r\nmust be a good home for the bees and easily handled by the operator.\r\nThe bottom board should not rest directly on the ground because of\r\ndampness, which rots the wood and is not good for the bees. Some use\r\nhive stands, others set the hives on a platform, supported by wooden\r\nblocks or on tiles as illustrated here.\r\n\r\nBeehives, like cottages nowadays, must have all the modern\r\nconveniences, and up-to-date furniture. In the brood chamber there are\r\nmovable frames into which the bees build the combs where the young are\r\nreared. With the introduction of these movable frames by Langstroth,\r\nfifty years ago, a new era in bee culture began. The furniture of the\r\nsecond-story rooms consists of rows of little section boxes, empty at\r\nfirst, but ready to be stored with comb honey. When nectar is plentiful\r\nand the brood-chambers are full to overflowing with honey, the workers\r\nare quick to take the hint and begin to store their surplus in the\r\nsection boxes.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that there is just one entrance to the hive. This\r\nfront door is sacred to the occupants. When going among his hives, the\r\nbee-keeper who knows his place keeps to the rear. If you respect their\r\nprivacy to this extent, the bees will come out in front, rise, and\r\nsail off above your head without taking the slightest notice of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT GOES ON IN THE BROOD CHAMBER?\r\n\r\nBees are the most public-spirited of creatures. They devote their time\r\nto the service of their colony. Their industries are all directed\r\ntowards one end: the increase of the number of bees in the world. When\r\nthe hive gets too full of bees, the colony divides and a \"swarm\" is the\r\nresult. Thus two colonies are established where there was but one, and\r\nthe number of individuals goes on increasing twice as fast.\r\n\r\nThe honey bee, like its wild cousin the bumble bee, passes through\r\nfour changes of form during its development. These are the _egg_, the\r\n_larva_, the _pupa_, and the _adult_. The queen is no ruler, but she\r\nis the mother-bee, and upon her depends the future of the bee colony.\r\nDealers in bees rear some of her young before selling each queen, in\r\norder to be sure that she has mated with a pure-blooded drone. These\r\nare called tested queens. Their progeny can be depended upon to possess\r\nthe good qualities of both parents. If the eggs of fine Italian queens\r\ndevelop into nervous, lazy, black-coated, and black-tempered workers,\r\nyou may safely say, \"They take after their father's family.\" The\r\negg-laying begins in the spring and at the height of honey harvest the\r\nqueen bee may lay as many as three thousand eggs every day. She hurries\r\nover the open comb inserting her body into the empty cells, and leaves\r\nan egg stuck fast at the bottom of each.\r\n\r\nThe worker bees grow from egg to maturity in small, hexagonal, or\r\nworker cells. Three or four days in the egg, six days as a footless\r\ngrub or larva floating serenely in a tiny well of liquid food supplied\r\nher by the nurse bees, twelve days wrapped in a silk coverlet of her\r\nown spinning, the young worker bee passes through her four stages of\r\ngrowth. At the end of her three weeks some inner impulse tells her to\r\nbe up and doing, and she obeys the stern call. She cuts a hole in the\r\ncap of her cell, sheds her skin for the last time (she did this five\r\nor six times during the larval or growing stage), and comes forth.\r\nIt takes her about one day to dry her \"feathers,\" adjust herself to\r\nher environment, and \"get busy.\" She finds many little open wells of\r\nunsealed honey, and as nobody pays any attention to her she drinks\r\nher fill. A round of duties await her, and she goes at them without\r\nbeing told how. She must do nursing, comb-building, cell-capping, and\r\ngeneral housework, and all without the least training. After about a\r\nweek of this, the young worker goes out to play, and then to work.\r\nShe is young, inexperienced, and self-conceited, and tries to call\r\nattention to herself like any vain young miss. When she brings in her\r\nfirst load of pollen she fairly swaggers with importance. Mr. Root\r\nsays, \"Her first load of pollen is just what the first pair of pants is\r\nto a boy baby.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a bee is a month old, she is in the prime of life. Three or four\r\nmonths of hard work in summer means old age for the workers, but in the\r\nbee colony there is no such thing as an old ladies' home. With their\r\nwings worn to stumps, their once velvety backs rubbed shiny, they may\r\nbe seen creeping away from the hive to die, having given their very\r\nlives in willing and faithful service of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nOf the unexplained wonders of the development of queens and drones, the\r\nmystery of the laying workers, and the other many and varied activities\r\nof the hive, we cannot tell much in detail here. Your own book on\r\nbee-keeping and larger books of reference will be mines of information.\r\nBut there are undiscovered North Poles in the bee world, and the young\r\nbee-keepers of to-day may be the Greeleys and the Pearys and the\r\nShackletons of this new-old science.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARMING\r\n\r\nDid you ever wonder why bees swarm? They have no regular dates for\r\ndoing things. Although they have been known to swarm in May, and even\r\nin April, you are not likely to get a swarm before June. Early swarms\r\nare the most valuable, therefore you should be ready, for bees are\r\nlike time and tide. Have the hive fitted with frames and keep it in a\r\ncool place. Bees swarm to increase the number of colonies. The date of\r\nswarming depends on local conditions and nobody can tell but the bees\r\nthemselves, and they won't, what these conditions are exactly. If there\r\nare too many bees, too much honey stored, thousands of workers hatching\r\ndaily, many young queens ready to emerge, the bees are likely to swarm.\r\nThe bee-keeper is on the lookout after he knows the signs and can guess\r\npretty shrewdly whether the swarm will be out in a few days or later.\r\nHe gets his apparatus together and his hives ready. Bees often \"hang\r\nout\" on the outside of the hive, and we used to think that was a \"sure\r\nsign,\" but it often fails.\r\n\r\nIt is the old queen that leaves the hive, but the bees that go out\r\nwith her are a mixture of young and old ones. No one knows how the\r\ndecision is made as to who shall go and who shall stay behind, but\r\nthere is never any indecision in the community that we can reckon with.\r\n\r\nSome hot Sunday you will be roused from your book by the excited\r\ncry: \"The bees! Look, there they go! The air's full of them. They're\r\nswarming. I'll bet they get away. No, they're settling.\" Meantime, if\r\nyou are the boy who owns the bees, you are getting ready to hive your\r\nfirst swarm.\r\n\r\nIt's no joke, for thrills will be chasing up your spine, and if you\r\ndidn't have so much to do you would be as excited as the rest. But\r\nsuccess may depend on your keeping cool. You have probably already\r\ninstructed the family in modern methods so that no one will be raising\r\na din by beating an old wash boiler, etc. If you have a garden hose\r\nhandy, let some one play a fine spray on the whirling bees. Nothing\r\nbrings them to time more quickly. When the bees have settled, place the\r\nhive conveniently near them, with a sheet or hive cover in front. Cut\r\nthe branch on which the bees are clustered and shake them off into or\r\nin front of the hive. If well disposed they will go in promptly.\r\n\r\nIf high trees and no shrubbery is the rule in the vicinity of your\r\nhives, you will probably need your long-handled swarm-catcher. Or you\r\nwill very soon begin the practice of clipping the wings of your queens.\r\nWhen the clipped queen brings out a swarm she hops about near the hive.\r\nShe may climb into a shrub if one is near by. Why not provide her with\r\na still more convenient forked stick as some bee-keepers do? She climbs\r\nup this, calls her family together, and you do the rest. You may prefer\r\nto capture the queen in your little queen trap, and place her at the\r\nentrance to a new hive which you should place on the stand where the\r\nold hive was. The bees will return to their old location when they\r\ndiscover that the queen is not with them. The new hive will receive\r\nthem and the queen when released will go in with her family. If the\r\nbees refuse to stay in the new hive, it may be because the hive is too\r\nhot. Prop up both hive and cover to allow extra ventilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING APPARATUS\r\n\r\nWhile I do not advise any amateur bee-keeper to try to construct his\r\nown hives and frames, I do think it is a fine idea to begin right away\r\nto study how to improve the appliances now in use. You will have to\r\ndiscard many of your own ideas as useless when you come to try to\r\napply them to practical use. There are lots of patented appliances for\r\nsale that make an experienced bee-keeper smile. He undoubtedly knows\r\na clever boy at home who can rig up a home-made contraption that will\r\ncost nothing at all, and do the work better than the expensive tool. A\r\nboy that keeps bees will find a knowledge of tools and wood-working of\r\ngreat advantage to him, and a girl's deft fingers will know how to put\r\nmaterials together that a professional would never think of.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I will here describe a swarm-catcher, devised by\r\na practical bee-keeper many years ago and recommended by an expert\r\nin Apiculture of the United States Department of Agriculture. The\r\nconstruction is so simple that I believe I could make one myself!\r\nThough home-made, it is interesting to see how thoroughly scientific\r\nare the essential features of this device, all based on a knowledge of\r\nbee instincts.\r\n\r\nThis description is adapted from an article by Dr. B. N. Gates in one\r\nof the annual reports of the Maryland Bee-Keepers' Association. The\r\naccompanying drawing was made from a picture of the swarm-catcher in\r\nthe same report. The apparatus consists of a box with one end open and\r\nsupported on a pole. The materials required are nails, a large wire\r\nhook, some thin boards, and two or three poles of different lengths.\r\nA saw, a bit and brace, and a hammer are the only tools required for\r\nmaking it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swarm-catcher that works like magic. Any handy boy can\r\nmake it]\r\n\r\nIt is bee nature to try to get into some small hole. To take advantage\r\nof this instinct the five sides of the swarm-catcher are perforated\r\nwith holes about one half an inch in diameter. While the framework of\r\nthe box should be light, it should also be strong and the materials\r\ngood so that the swarm-catcher will last for years.\r\n\r\nA convenient size has been found to be eight by eight by sixteen. A\r\nhole to fit the size of the poles should be bored in the centre of the\r\ntop and one at the bottom. The big wire hook should be screwed into the\r\ntop far enough from the centre so that it will not be interfered with\r\nby the projecting end of the pole. A slot should be cut lengthwise of\r\nthe top, sufficiently large to allow a frame of honey-comb to be put\r\nin so that it hangs down inside to attract the bees. This honey bait\r\nis essential to the successful working of the swarm-catcher. You can\r\ndevise other ways of suspending it to the top inside of the box. It is\r\nthought that a coat of green paint on the outside and one of black on\r\nthe inside induces the bees to enter the box more readily.\r\n\r\nA swarm-catcher like this cuts out all the loss of time and danger of\r\nlosing a valuable swarm of bees while preparations to hive them are\r\ngoing on. And you can practically catch a swarm anywhere with this\r\ndevice. If they light on a stone wall, a tree trunk, or on the ground,\r\nyou simply brush a pint or so of them into the box, stick the sharp\r\nlower end of the pole into the ground near by, and go off and leave\r\nthem to go in at their leisure. A whiff or so of smoke is needed when\r\nyou first go up before beginning to wield the brush.\r\n\r\nFor swarms hanging in the ordinary way from limbs of trees or vines,\r\nwhile the bees are clustering, take a frame from one of the hives and\r\nhang it in the swarm-catcher. It is best to take a comb containing\r\ndeveloping brood and some honey. This forms a well-nigh irresistible\r\nlure for the swarming bees. One look at the pendant mass of bees will\r\ntell you what length of pole you need in the box. Put on your veil and\r\ngloves and hoist the box up into the tree. Put the open end of the box\r\nup against the mass of bees and get as many of them into it or onto it\r\nas possible. Catch the branch with the hook on the box and give it a\r\nvigorous shaking. This unsettles the rest of the bees and they will be\r\nattracted instinctively to follow the rest into the box where the brood\r\ncells are. Once the bees are safely clustered in and on the box there\r\nis no rush about hiving them. They are safe to be left hanging by the\r\nhook within ten feet or so of their original clustering place or with\r\nthe pole stuck in the ground near by. They are secure there for hours,\r\neven for days, but one usually has time to hive them the same day. The\r\nswarm should not be left in the hot sun.\r\n\r\nHiving is done in the usual way. After the hive is prepared with combs\r\nor foundation, shake the bees from the swarm-catcher either into or in\r\nfront of the hive. With large swarms it is advisable to prop the hive\r\nbody up slightly from the bottom board to enlarge the entrance. The\r\n\"marching in\" is a wonderful sight.\r\n\r\nAn established colony of bees cannot be moved five feet without\r\ncausing them confusion. Before the newly hived bees have had time to\r\nlocate themselves and set to work at honey gathering, the hive should\r\nbe moved to its permanent location. It is not safe to delay longer than\r\ntwilight of the day they are hived. When once they get a location fixed\r\nthey return to it and are lost.\r\n\r\nIf they refuse to be reconciled in a new hive, put in a frame of young\r\nbrood from some other hive and try them again. They seldom desert an\r\nobvious duty like the caring for young.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING THE HIVE\r\n\r\nThe modern art of bee-keeping was made possible by the invention of the\r\nhive with movable frames. Some of the many reasons for opening the hive\r\nare:\r\n\r\n1. To take off honey.\r\n\r\n2. To see if enough honey has been stored for winter.\r\n\r\n3. To find the queen.\r\n\r\n4. To introduce a new queen.\r\n\r\n5. To examine the brood.\r\n\r\nBefore opening the hive know just what you are going to look for. Get\r\nthe smoker well going; shavings, punk, excelsior, or chips crowded in\r\nmake a good smudge; you want much smoke and little fire. Put on your\r\nbee veil. For a greeting, blow a little smoke in at the entrance of\r\nthe hive you are going to open. Loosen the cover which you will find\r\nto be glued tight with propolis by the bees. A dull putty knife or\r\nscrew-driver is a good tool for this job. As fast as you unseal the\r\ncracks, blow smoke into them. At this juncture it is well to close the\r\nhive for a few minutes to give the bees time to \"think it over.\" The\r\nbetter the grade of bees the less smoke is required. Take your time.\r\nKeep your nerve steady and the smoker handy. Loosen the frames and take\r\nthem out one by one. In order to see what is going on in the frames\r\nyou must clear off the bees. Do this in such a way that you will not\r\nendanger the queen if she should be on the frame. Poke the bees off\r\nso that they fall bewildered back into the hive. Set the frame down\r\nagainst the outside of the hive and take out another.\r\n\r\nThere are cells of three sizes in the brood combs. Queen cells are\r\nlarge, standing out from the surface of the comb quite prominently.\r\nThe drone and worker closely resemble one another, but the drone cells\r\nare the larger. Honey is stored in both drone and worker cells. If you\r\nwish to destroy the queen cells to prevent swarming you will find it\r\na ticklish job, even with a sharp, slender knife, not to ruin a lot of\r\ncomb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drone and queen trap at hive entrance]\r\n\r\nIt is often important to locate the queen. If you wish to clip her\r\nwings, find her you must. She is usually near the middle of the hive,\r\nsurrounded by her court, a rosette of workers. She is quite different\r\nin shape from the workers. It is well to study her picture before going\r\nto look for her. A queen's wings are not much to cut, but you will need\r\na steady nerve if you do it free hand. Many devices are to be had to\r\nmake the operation less difficult and to insure safety to the rest of\r\nthe queen. The danger is all to her, for although she is armed she will\r\nnot sting you. She reserves her sting for some rival in her own class.\r\n\r\nHarvesting any crop has interesting features, but nothing has the\r\npeculiar charm of taking off honey. Loosen the cover, puff in a little\r\nsmoke, lift the cover, then the whole super off. Put on a new super\r\nand replace the cover. Have your bee brush ready and as you lift the\r\nfitted sections out of the super, brush the bees that cling to them\r\ndown to the entrance to the hive. This is the old way and is fraught\r\nwith dangers. Moreover, the bees may regard one robbery as sufficient\r\nexcuse for another. Robbery is a serious matter in the apiary. The\r\nmodern way is to use the Porter bee-escape. This device obviates all\r\nthe difficulties and once you have \"got the hang of it,\" you will have\r\nno further trouble getting honey from your hives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTINGS: PREVENTION AND CURE\r\n\r\nThe bee mittens, the veil, and the smoker are all preventive measures.\r\nA good deal depends on the way you behave when working with bees. If\r\nyou are nervous and anxious you probably will act that way and the bees\r\nhave a way of understanding and are likely to find you.\r\n\r\nRemove the sting by a scraping motion with a knife blade or some hive\r\ntool you happen to have handy. If you use the thumb and finger you\r\nsqueeze the tiny bulb at the outer end of the sting, and inject the\r\npoison into your blood.\r\n\r\nExperts have little or no faith in cures which are rubbed on. They\r\nunderestimate the comfort one gets \"doing something\" for a spot that\r\nhurts so mighty bad. So go ahead and put on alcohol or baking soda or\r\nammonia; you can't do a bit of harm that way. In the meantime nature is\r\nbusy neutralizing the acid the bee punished you with.\r\n\r\nMrs. Comstock, in \"How to Keep Bees,\" gives these maxims for opening\r\nthe hive:\r\n\r\nHave the smoker ready to give forth a good volume of smoke.\r\n\r\nUse the smoker to scare the bees rather than to punish them.\r\n\r\nDo not stand in front of the hive lest the bees passing out and in take\r\numbrage.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to drop any implements with which you are working; take\r\nhold of all things firmly.\r\n\r\nMove steadily and not nervously.\r\n\r\nDo not run if frightened, for the bees understand what running away\r\nmeans as well as you do.\r\n\r\nIf the bees attack you, move slowly away, smoking them off as you go.\r\n\r\nIf a bee annoys you by her threatening attitude for some time, kill her\r\nruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERING\r\n\r\nBefore buying your hives you must decide where your bees are to winter.\r\nIf you have a suitable shelter you can use the ordinary hives; but\r\nif your bees are to winter outside, you may decide that you want the\r\ngreat chaff-packed, double hives. As the summer wanes every hive must\r\nbe examined to make sure that the colony is strong and that the supply\r\nof honey is not short. If the season has been a bad one for flowers,\r\nor if the region provides few blossoming fields it may be necessary\r\nto feed the bees. Special directions are needed and any bee book will\r\nsupply them. A strong swarm, supplied with twenty-five pounds to\r\nthirty-five pounds of honey, will winter without serious loss in a\r\nchaff hive. Other protection than that afforded by a good windbreak is\r\nunnecessary. In our furnace-heated houses no part of the cellar is cool\r\nenough all the time for the bees. The temperature should not go above\r\nforty-eight degrees Fahr., nor below forty degrees; forty-three degrees\r\nis considered just right. Sudden changes are bad for bees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beehive covered with newspapers and waterproof paper for\r\nwintering outdoors]\r\n\r\nMany experienced bee-keepers winter their colonies successfully\r\noutdoors with home-made protection. The ordinary hives, with the covers\r\non but with the supers off, of course, are put into winter quarters\r\nin this way: Fold seven or eight thicknesses of newspaper over the top\r\nof the cover and sides. Make a neat job of this as if you intended to\r\nsend the box by mail. Use a few tacks if needed. Over this fold a large\r\npiece of tar or other waterproof paper. There is a right way to fold\r\nthe ends of this outer wrapper, and a wrong way. The illustration shows\r\nthe right way. If the paper is brought down from the top first and\r\nround the ends from the sides over that (the wrong way), pockets will\r\nbe formed which hold snow and water. Nail thin pieces of wood on to\r\nhold the folds securely. The entrance to the hive should not be closed\r\nas bees come out more or less on warm days in winter. Be sure that the\r\nentrance is always free from dead bees.\r\n\r\nAnother way to protect hives from the cold when wintering outside is\r\nto construct a packing case three and a half inches bigger in all\r\ndimensions than the hive. Set one of these down over each hive and pack\r\nthe space between hive and case with any kind of dry packing material,\r\nsuch as shavings, sawdust, cork chips, dry leaves. Any of these\r\nmaterials used wet would do more harm than good. Some sort of shelf or\r\nprojection should be so placed over the entrance as to keep it open as\r\nwith other forms of winter protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING\r\n\r\nIn the spring, bees need water. If the tree blossoms are late in coming\r\nout, sirup is often fed to the bees to give them a start. Patented\r\nfeeding devices are not necessary. A flat tin pan works admirably. The\r\nbest sirup for all purposes is plain granulated sugar and water, made\r\ncold. Stir in all the sugar that the water will hold. Fill the feeding\r\npan with excelsior first, then sirup, and place it in the super. Little\r\nladders leading up to the top of the pan will help the bees get at the\r\nsirup.\r\n\r\nFeeding is also practised in the fall if the amount of stored honey is\r\nshort. The feeding of honey is likely to start the bees to robbing.\r\nUnder no circumstances should \"market\" honey be fed to bees. Diseases\r\nare transmitted by this practice.\r\n\r\n              PLANTS THAT FURNISH HONEY OR POLLEN OR BOTH\r\n\r\n    gill-over-the-ground      }\r\n    shadbush                  }\r\n    tulip tree                }\r\n    willow                    }\r\n    grape                     }\r\n    sorrel                    } spring.\r\n    elm                       }\r\n    maple                     }\r\n    dandelion                 }\r\n    hawthorn                  }\r\n    red bud                   }\r\n    fruit trees               }\r\n\r\n    clovers (cultivated)      }\r\n    alfalfa                   }\r\n    wild sweet clover         }\r\n    raspberry                 }\r\n    bee-balm                  }\r\n    blueberry                 }\r\n    chestnut                  }\r\n    corn                      } summer.\r\n    fig-wort                  }\r\n    locust                    }\r\n    basswood                  }\r\n    catnip                    }\r\n    horse mint                }\r\n    mustard                   }\r\n    sage                      }\r\n    sumach                    }\r\n\r\n    buckwheat                 }\r\n    spider flower             }\r\n    sunflowers                }\r\n    fireweed                  }\r\n    smartweed                 } fall.\r\n    milk-weed                 }\r\n    golden-rod                }\r\n    aster                     }\r\n    rape                      }\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTS OF THE HIVE\r\n\r\nBesides honey, bees make use of wax to construct combs, bee-bread for\r\nlarvæ food, and propolis for glue. If you think the bees gather honey\r\nfrom the flowers you are greatly mistaken. Nobody knows yet quite how\r\nhoney is made. Chemists say that it has in it water, grape sugar, a\r\nlittle formic acid, some mineral matter, albuminoids, and essential\r\noils. But this list leaves us little the wiser. No chemist has been\r\nable to combine these materials into honey. The nectar gathered by bees\r\npasses directly into a receptacle, the honey-sack or honey-stomach,\r\nwhich is used for that purpose only. It does not go the same road\r\nas the bee's food. The notion that bees swallow the nectar and then\r\nunswallow it is as erroneous as it is unappetizing. The flavour, body,\r\nand colour of honey depend on the source of the nectar, the age, the\r\namount of chemical change wrought by the bees, and the completeness of\r\nthe ripening process which goes on in the hive before the cells are\r\ncapped. Honey is a very wholesome sweet, far more easily digested than\r\ncane or grape sugar.\r\n\r\nIf the making of honey is mysterious, what can we say of wax\r\nproduction? In the height of the honey season we can watch the bees\r\nmaking wax through a glass-sided hive. Mrs. Comstock says: \"A certain\r\nnumber of self-elected citizens gorge themselves with honey and hang\r\nup in chains or curtains, each bee clinging by her front feet to the\r\nhind feet of the one above her, like Japanese acrobats; and there\r\nthey remain sometimes for two days until the wax scales appear pushed\r\nout from every pocket.\" Sometimes a honey-and pollen-laden bee will\r\ncome home from pasture with flakes of wax exuding from the wax plates\r\non her abdomen. But this happens only when wax is needed for comb\r\nmaking. At other times no amount of honey gorging will produce a scrap\r\nof wax. Does this not hint at mystery and something higher than mere\r\nintelligence?\r\n\r\nYou would think in such a perfectly organized community there would be\r\nsomething like specialization. Such appears not to be the case. All the\r\nworkers seem to do all the different kinds of things. Let us say a bee\r\ngoes out and gets a load of honey the first thing in the morning. When\r\nshe comes in she goes to the comb to deposit her honey, then to the\r\nbrood cells where she combs the pollen off her legs into a cell where\r\nit is stored to feed the young bees later. Perhaps she sees in passing\r\nsome cells which need capping, does that, then away to gorge herself\r\nwith honey and make wax, then builds her own or her neighbour's wax\r\nonto the comb. If the day is hot it may occur to her and a thousand\r\nothers to construct a living fan and keep the air stirring inside the\r\nhive by waving their wings. In a system like this there is no resting,\r\nno play, no shirking, no specializing. There is always work to do and\r\nalways somebody doing it with a will in the perfect socialism.\r\n\r\nMany boys and girls of these days are fortunate in having had at school\r\nan observation hive. No bee-keeper will be long without one if he has\r\nany curiosity about what is going on in the dark hive, or if he is\r\nambitious to solve some of the mysteries. An ordinary hive can be made\r\ninto a good observation hive by putting a pane of glass in the sides\r\nand top. There should be hinged doors to fit tightly over the glass. A\r\ntwo-frame hive devised by Prof. V. L. Kellogg has both sides of glass\r\nso that the whole domestic economy of the bee family can readily be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND ENEMIES\r\n\r\nYou will not be in the bee business long before you learn that bees\r\nhave diseases and enemies. In fact, it is better to face that fact\r\nat the beginning and learn how to recognize and combat the troubles.\r\nCarelessness along this line is inexcusable and will surely cause\r\nfailure. Several states have official inspectors whose business it is\r\nto know bee diseases and methods of controlling them. He is required\r\nto inspect apiaries where diseases are suspected, and the best thing to\r\ndo is to interest him in your work and get all the help from him you\r\ncan. An ounce of prevention will save a pound of cure, every time.\r\n\r\nIf there is a Bee-Keepers' Association in your county, by all means\r\njoin it and help make it a live, active organization. The United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture can give you much needed information as to\r\nwho the men are in your locality who are officers in the associations\r\nand official inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING HONEY\r\n\r\nThe best honey market is the home market as I have said. You may have\r\nto work up a demand in your neighbourhood and there are many ways to do\r\nthis which ingenious boys and girls will devise. Most of us, if we can\r\nafford to use honey at all, know it only as a \"spread\" for hot biscuits\r\nor griddle cakes. But not every one knows that honey is a very much\r\nmore wholesome sweet than cane sugar. Many people cannot eat sugar at\r\nall, but find honey does not cause indigestion. If you could persuade\r\nyour neighbours to buy your honey for their children instead of candy,\r\n\"all-day-suckers\" coloured with cheap dyes, and sirups made of nobody\r\nknows what, you would be doing something worth while.\r\n\r\nHoney is used in cooking too, in many ways. Get your mother or sister\r\ninterested in trying some receipts in which honey takes the place of\r\nsugar. If you make a success of this you can get other people to making\r\nhoney cakes, thus creating a demand for your product.\r\n\r\nOne enterprising chap made a great success by first going from\r\nhouse to house and giving away samples of his honey. He also left a\r\nself-addressed postal card with prices and order blank printed on one\r\nside, and nine out of ten of the people he called on sent orders. It\r\nseemed a pity to waste a good postal card and everybody likes to help a\r\nbright boy along; and beside they wanted the honey! It might be well to\r\nhave a little pamphlet telling about your honey and of the many uses it\r\nmay be put to, with a receipt for honey cake, perhaps. You will get a\r\nreputation, if you try, for pure products, neat packages and courteous\r\ndealings. As your output increases from year to year your market will\r\ngrow, until you, like the boy we mentioned at the beginning of this\r\nchapter, have a business worth at least a thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY EXPERIENCE WITH HONEY BEES\r\n\r\nIt was just by chance that I ever got started in keeping bees. There\r\nwere several boys about my size in the neighbourhood at my home and we\r\nused to go swimming and play ball together. One fine spring day a few\r\nof us were walking down the road toward the swimming pool when we found\r\na swarm of bees on a fence post. One of the fellows knew how to hive\r\nthe swarm, so we got a box from the store and watched while he got the\r\nbees into it. It was the first time that I had seen a swarm hived and\r\nthe performance proved very interesting to me.\r\n\r\nI bought that swarm in the old box for seventy-five cents, very well\r\nsatisfied with the bargain, for of course the box would be full of\r\nhoney in a short time!\r\n\r\nThe colony was placed upon a bench in the front yard. One night the old\r\nbull got out and upset the bench. The bees were ready to sting anything\r\nnext day. I bundled up until I was sting proof and then got them\r\nstraightened up. The combs were broken which gave the bees a setback\r\nfrom which they did not recover. I did not get any honey from them and\r\nthey died out in the winter.\r\n\r\nAn old bee-keeper who lived near us gave me two swarms the next spring.\r\nOne of them left the hive and flew to the woods and the other was weak\r\nand died. It began to seem as though bees were hard to keep. I got a\r\nbook called \"A B C of Bee Culture,\" and read it. I soon learned that\r\nbees should be kept in movable frame hives so they could be easily\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nI had no bees now, but, although we were laughed at, my father and I\r\nentered into a partnership. He furnished the hives and implements and\r\nI furnished the bees and labour. We were to divide profits equally. We\r\nbought two hives, a smoker, and a bee veil. I caught one swarm in the\r\nwoods and bought another. They were both late swarms and died in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nSuccess was still far off and things did not look very bright, but I\r\nhad learned how not to do lots of things. The two hives we had were not\r\nthe best, so we sold them and bought five of a different kind for the\r\nnext spring. The outlay was large and no profits, but I was determined\r\nto succeed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring I caught a swarm early in the season and it made a few\r\npounds of surplus honey which we used at home. During the latter part\r\nof August my chum and I were out squirrel hunting and he found a swarm\r\nthat had built combs on the limb of a large tree. We got it into a hive\r\nand I bought his share of the swarm. This colony needed feeding, so I\r\nfed it on sugar and water. Both colonies lived through the winter and\r\nmade a strong start in the spring. Each gave a swarm and I caught both.\r\n\r\nThe book and the old bee-keeper taught me that Italian bees were\r\nbetter than the wild bees, so I invested in two Italian queens which\r\nI got by mail from a queen breeder. I killed the old queens in two\r\nof the colonies and introduced the new ones. They did some good work\r\nthat summer and lived through the winter. The next spring I had two\r\ncolonies of black or wild bees and two of Italians. The blacks together\r\nmade about twenty pounds of surplus honey, while the two Italians\r\nmade nearly two hundred pounds. This showed me that there was a great\r\ndifference in bees. Each colony swarmed once, making eight in all.\r\n\r\nWe had now made a success and the business was on a good footing even\r\nafter four years of failure. That last honey crop was worth about\r\nthirty dollars, and the bees and hives were worth about forty-five\r\ndollars. We were encouraged.\r\n\r\nThat fall I was sixteen years old and had decided to go to college.\r\nThe president of the agricultural college in this state offered me a\r\nchance to work my way through college by taking charge of the bees on\r\nthe college farm. I gladly accepted it and sold my bees at home.\r\n\r\nLife at college was very different from home life, but the bees always\r\nfurnished a source of pleasure and recreation during my spare moments\r\non week days and on Saturdays. In the summer months I either worked\r\nwith the government bee-men or for the college.\r\n\r\nThe bees have not only given me lots of pleasure, but they have made it\r\npossible for me to pay my entire tuition and expenses for five years\r\nat college. Besides studying and attending to my bees, I have had time\r\nfor much other fun, and this year I made the 'varsity football team and\r\nplayed in every game.\r\n\r\nSome people think that the honey is not worth the stings, but my advice\r\nis to get a colony and try your hand.\r\n\r\n                                                     SYDNEY S. STABBLER\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW I EARNED TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS\r\n\r\nI had helped with the bees more or less all my life, so that I already\r\nknew how to handle them when my high school course was broken into by\r\nillness and I had an enforced vacation of one year and a half. I was\r\nable at this time to devote to the bees one full season, that is, from\r\nApril through July.\r\n\r\nMy father allowed me the use of bees, hives, combs, etc., for queen\r\nrearing. The queens I sold for seventy-five cents and one dollar each,\r\naccording to the grade. To my father I furnished one hundred queens\r\nat the reduced price of fifty cents each as rent for the bees, hives,\r\netc. I had about ninety nuclei of two frames each. During the swarming\r\nseason I used a good many natural cells from the better colonies. Later\r\nI used artificial, dipped cells which I made myself. In the latter case\r\nI took larvæ from the very best queens in the apiary and placed the\r\ncells in queenless colonies to be developed, or sometimes in colonies\r\nwhich were superseding their queens. When the cells were nearly ready\r\nto hatch they were placed in the nuclei where the young queens remained\r\nuntil they commenced laying, when they were ready for sale.\r\n\r\nAltogether I made a little over one hundred dollars that season. I was\r\nthen eighteen years old and determined to go to college. Two years\r\nlater I began my studies at the University of California, working for\r\nmy board in a private family and drawing from the one hundred dollars\r\nfor incidentals. Clothing I had received at home and had made myself\r\nfor the most part.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco earthquake occurred on the eighteenth of April, in\r\nthe spring of my freshman year, and college was closed immediately, so\r\nthat I was able to enter again into the queen rearing business. That\r\nseason I sent out advertising cards to the members of the California\r\nBee-Keepers' Association and sold nearly all my queens to them. The\r\nfinancial result was nearly the same as for the former season.\r\n\r\nSo in all I made about two hundred dollars, which paid for the\r\nincidentals during three years of my college career which is as\r\nfar as I have gone. By \"incidentals\" I mean books, paper, and such\r\nnecessities, also subscriptions to the college daily paper, class and\r\nassociation dues, tickets to college jinks, theatricals, games, etc. I\r\nalso spent a good deal for tickets to concerts, plays, etc., as that\r\nwas my first opportunity to hear the great musicians and actors and I\r\nconsidered that a part of my education.\r\n\r\n                                                         FLORA MCINTYRE\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFITS OF BEE-KEEPING\r\n\r\nI have been asked to tell something of my early experiences as a\r\nbee-keeper, for boys and girls who may become interested in this very\r\nfascinating, and, I may say at the same time, profitable, pursuit.\r\n\r\nI think it may be said of bee-keeping as sailors say of seafaring--once\r\na bee-keeper always a bee-keeper.\r\n\r\nI should like to tell you in a few words what can be expected from a\r\ndozen and a half hives of bees with an average of one and one half\r\ndays a week spent in the apiary. I believe really, though, that when I\r\nbegan keeping bees it was not because I expected to make much money.\r\nThe whole story of the bee life, as read from different books which I\r\nsecured after becoming interested, was so wonderful and fascinating\r\nthat I could hardly wait until spring so that I might study the two\r\nhives acquired through the winter. That first spring and summer there\r\nwere only those old box hives, which could not be opened for inside\r\nstudy, and all observations had to be confined to watching the bees\r\nfrom the outside. The next summer some modern hives that could be taken\r\napart and every nook and corner laid open to observation were bought.\r\nIn the fall I was very fortunate in securing eighteen colonies of bees\r\nat an auction sale, paying therefor only fifty cents a colony, much\r\nto my satisfaction and my neighbours' amusement. Most of the hives\r\nwere frame, but of an undesirable sort of frame. The next summer these\r\ncolonies were transferred to up-to-date hives. That summer, and for the\r\nnext succeeding six summers, these colonies did not fail to yield on\r\nan average about seventy dollars' worth of honey and wax. Counting out\r\nwinter losses the number of colonies per year would average twelve, the\r\nnumber of pounds of honey about three hundred and seventy-five, worth\r\ntwenty cents a pound. The bees received only a small part of my time\r\neach day.\r\n\r\nLater, when a student at the Ohio State University, as manager of\r\nthe apiary there, about the same results were obtained, so that an\r\naverage of about five dollars a hive is a conservative estimate. If\r\none begins in a small way, in a few years he should be able to manage\r\none hundred colonies. But it should be remembered that the yield per\r\nhive may decrease somewhat as the number of colonies increases, because\r\nof the danger of launching in the business on a large scale. The best\r\ninsurance against loss is a thorough study and understanding of all the\r\ndetails by the practice of bee-keeping on a small scale for a term of\r\nyears first.\r\n\r\nI may say that the income from the bees aided not a little in helping\r\nme through college, and I may say, also, without exaggeration that\r\nthis interest in bees by one enthusiastic student helped in no small\r\ndegree toward the inauguration of a course in bee-keeping at our own\r\nOhio State University. To make the story complete I think I should add\r\nthat the writer of this article is at present engaged as assistant in\r\napiculture, doing experimental work in apiculture in the government\r\napiaries at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThere is opportunity for those who wish to take up some problem\r\nrelating to apiculture as a subject of investigation, and the\r\nagricultural colleges and experiment stations will no doubt in the\r\nfuture give more and more attention to the investigation of problems\r\nrelated to this interesting and profitable pursuit.\r\n\r\n                                                       ARTHUR H. MCCRAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nRAISING SILKWORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough silkworms are not actually reared in the open air, there is so\r\nmuch outdoor work and moderate exercise connected with their care that\r\nthe subject may properly be included in a book on outdoor work.\r\n\r\nThe best food for silkworms is the leaf of the white mulberry. If you\r\nhave already a hedge of this or several trees you can begin at once.\r\nIf not, several years must elapse while you raise your preliminary\r\ncrop of mulberry trees from seeds or cuttings. It is useless to buy\r\nsilkworm eggs if you have not the wherewithal to feed your infant\r\ncaterpillars. You may not think of going into silkworm rearing in a\r\ncommercial way but only as an interesting bit of nature study. Why not\r\nmake up some neat attractive cases, each containing a little collection\r\nillustrating the four stages of the growth of this insect? Heat a few\r\neggs to destroy life, then glue them to a card; preserve a caterpillar\r\nin a vial of alcohol; glue a cocoon to a card; pin and spread two of\r\nthe moths, a male and a female, and pin them into the box. From such\r\na box school children will get a far more definite idea of insect\r\nmetamorphosis than they will ever get from a book on zoölogy. Such\r\nlittle collections ought to sell well in schools where nature study,\r\nzoölogy, or agriculture is taught.\r\n\r\nThe mulberry silkworm makes the best silk, although it is by no means\r\nthe only silk-spinning insect. Every now and then we read of some one\r\nwho is experimenting with the silk of our American or giant silkworms,\r\nthe _Promethea_ or the _Cecropia_, or with the silk spun by spiders.\r\nBut none as yet compares with _Bombyx mori_ in either quantity or\r\nquality of its product or in ease of rearing or in reeling of the silk.\r\n\r\nThe adult moth lays between three and seven hundred eggs during the\r\nfirst three days after she emerges from her cocoon. In a week or ten\r\ndays she dies, her work finished. Moths in the wild state are at some\r\npains to deposit their eggs on the favourite food plant of their young,\r\nbut in the case of _Bombyx mori_ this instinct has been lost in the\r\ncountless years of domestication. The eggs, when laid, are moist with\r\na sort of glue which secures them to the surface upon which they are\r\ndeposited. The winter is passed in the egg stage. A cool, dry place is\r\nsafest for them, where no sudden changes of temperature are possible.\r\nA steady temperature of thirty-five degrees is ideal, and they must\r\nbe enclosed in something that is mouse proof, though not air-tight. A\r\nperforated tin box is right for this purpose. Silkworm eggs for study\r\nmay be obtained from dealers in miscellaneous insects, birds, animals,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAs spring approaches you must watch the mulberry leaves and make your\r\npreparations. Any room in which temperature and ventilation can be\r\nregulated will serve for rearing silkworms. You should have some racks\r\nmade of lattice work, and shelves, open to the air, on which to place\r\nthem. I have seen a clothes-horse, with racks resting upon the rungs,\r\nused for this. A supply of cheap wrapping paper or newspapers should\r\nbe on hand to put on the shelves, and some coarse netting, the use of\r\nwhich will be described later. Do not make the mistake of getting too\r\nmany eggs. An ounce does not seem like very much, but the well-grown\r\nworms from an ounce of eggs ought to have at least seventy-five square\r\nyards of shelf space. They will require during the first six days\r\nonly eleven pounds of leaves, six meals a day, but during the eight\r\ndays just before spinning they will require over half a ton of food.\r\nImagine lugging in two hundred weight of fresh mulberry leaves five\r\ntimes a day to feed these ravenous things so dependent upon you!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Movable frame and light shelves for feeding silkworms]\r\n\r\nWarmth and moisture are required for hatching the eggs. As the spring\r\nadvances and the mulberry shows signs of putting forth its leaves, the\r\nsilkworm eggs should be spread thinly on sheets of paper on the shelves\r\nin a temperature of about fifty-five degrees Fahr. The temperature\r\nshould be increased after three or four days and gradually raised to\r\nseventy-three degrees Fahr. Sprinkle the floor to make the air moist,\r\nbut do not wet the eggs. At this temperature hatching will take place\r\nafter about ten days' time. Watch the eggs. When they begin to whiten\r\nyou must get to work, as the first worms will soon be out. Take two\r\nthicknesses of coarse tulle or bobinet cut the size of the racks. Chop\r\nsome young, tender mulberry leaves very fine. Scatter a thin layer of\r\nthese bits over the cloth and lightly lay it over the hatching eggs.\r\nNo sooner do the young silkworms become aware of the presence of their\r\nfavourite vegetable than they make their way to it, coming up through\r\nthe holes of the bobinet as easily as \"rolling off a log.\" They are\r\ntiny creatures. Eight of them laid end to end would hardly measure an\r\ninch. As hatching usually takes place in the morning, by ten o'clock\r\nthe worms will all have crawled through the netting to the leaves on\r\nthe upper layer of the net. This can now be transferred to the rearing\r\nshelf. The netting should be kept well stretched, as the worms may\r\nbe injured if buried down amongst the leaf bits. All through life\r\nsilkworms must be handled with extreme care. If necessary to lift any\r\nindividual from one shelf to another it should be done with tenderest\r\ntouch. Rough treatment is fatal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A clothes-horse fitted with racks for feeding silkworms]\r\n\r\nFor young worms the newly opened leaves are the best. As they grow\r\nolder their tastes change and the more mature leaves may be given. A\r\nquantity of leaves may be gathered at one time and kept fresh. The\r\nleaves themselves should never be put into water. Prepare the food\r\nby removing the foliage you intend to feed from the stems. Then chop\r\nor cut it into fine shreds. Six times a day a small quantity of the\r\nprepared leaf should be sprinkled lightly over the netting.\r\n\r\nLike other caterpillars, silkworms shed their skins at certain\r\nintervals. The six-day period between hatching and the first moult\r\nis called \"the first age.\" On the fourth day it is best to change\r\nthe beds, as the droppings from the worms and the litter of uneaten\r\nleaves are not healthy for the moulting caterpillars. Spread fresh\r\nleaves on nets and place over the worms in the evening. By morning all\r\nwill be ready for the clean shelf and doubled space. As the sixth day\r\napproaches, the worms lose appetite and cease to move about. Finally\r\nthe skin whitens, the head seems to grow larger, and each little\r\ncreature pulls himself out of his old skin and finds himself clad in a\r\nnew suit. I imagine he must feel very much as a boy does when on the\r\nfirst really warm day in April his mother allows him to shed his winter\r\nunderwear, get his hair cut short, and wear his summer blouse and\r\nknickers.\r\n\r\nThe young worm, however, does not feel very lively at first. No food\r\nshould be given for several hours. When signs of waking are evident,\r\nfood should be given and the worms transferred to clean shelves by\r\nmeans of the nets. On the third day they should be changed to fresh\r\npapers. Four meals a day are needed by the caterpillars at this time.\r\nThe second age is shorter than the first, being only four or five days.\r\nThe skin now changes in colour from gray to yellowish white. After the\r\nsecond moult their food need not be cut much, but they require a lot of\r\nit, as they should double their size during the third age, which lasts\r\nsix or seven days. If the weather is pretty warm their development is\r\nfaster. They should never be crowded nor allowed to go hungry. Always\r\nchange to clean shelves when the dead leaves and excrement become the\r\nleast offensive. This odour, which you can escape by leaving the room,\r\nmay be deadly to your pets. They are helpless to escape it, and are\r\nentirely at your mercy.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourth age, _i. e._, after the third moult, give more space\r\nand feed small branches with leaves on. Always remove every berry from\r\nthe mulberry branches or the worms will eat them and be made sick.\r\nTheir appetites are enormous, their growth rapid. Change the beds four\r\ntimes during this period of nine days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rack or ladder for silkworms to spin on]\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth moult the worms pass into the last age. Five or six\r\ndays of voracious feeding brings them near that most dramatic event\r\nin their lives--the cocoon spinning. For three days, now, instead\r\nof eating steadily they wander aimlessly about, as if seeking they\r\nknow not what; they wag their heads; they behave in an altogether\r\nrestless and uncertain way. Is it some mortal ailment or mere\r\n\"weakness of intellect?\" You are expecting this and have prepared\r\nfor it beforehand. They will not need to search long for a place to\r\nmount and spin in safety and security their cocoon of shining silvery\r\nsilk. Farmers' Bulletin, No. 165, recommends the use of small, clean,\r\nleafless brush tied together into bundles and fastened between the\r\nshelves in rows a foot or so apart. Some use a sort of rack or ladder\r\nof narrow strips of wood which should be placed upright on the shelf\r\nwhere the worms can easily find it. They spin between the slats. Any\r\nworms which seem not to be ready to spin with the others should be fed\r\nuntil they, too, feel the impulse to travel.\r\n\r\nAs the process of spinning takes some hours, there will be no\r\ndifficulty in observing it from start to finish. You are entitled to\r\nthis exhibition, for, without your constant care and feeding, these\r\ncreatures would not have been able to develop. The dull, inactive\r\nsilkworm has acquired wonderful agility, and without practice is able\r\nto weave himself into his sleeping bag with astonishing celerity,\r\nreeling out his twelve hundred or sixteen hundred yards of silk in one\r\ncontinuous thread. There are no knots or kinks in it. It is inaccurate\r\nas well as rather silly to refer to the cocoon as a shroud or burial\r\ncasket, as some do. The creature inside is just as much alive as ever\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nThe cocoons with the live pupæ inside are called green cocoons. To\r\nprepare them for market they are usually subjected to heat either in\r\nthe oven or by steaming. No water should touch the cocoons, neither\r\nshould the oven be hot enough to brown them. After heating they should\r\nbe dried in the sun or other heat. Open one when you think they may be\r\ndry; if they are, the pupæ inside can be rubbed into powder with the\r\nfingers. A good price per pound is paid for dried cocoons, but it takes\r\nfive hundred or more to weigh a pound.\r\n\r\nIf you have never seen a moth emerge from its cocoon you should keep\r\nseveral of your cocoons. In eighteen or twenty days the moth comes out,\r\nusually in early morning. Invite your friends to have a look, too. Must\r\nthe moth break the threads in getting out, or is the cocoon woven in\r\na manner to provide a gateway when it shall be needed? How does the\r\ncreature get out anyway, and what is it like when it first arrives in\r\nthe open? Wonderful happenings must have been going on inside to make\r\na winged moth out of that naked caterpillar. Something left in the\r\ncocoon rattles when you shake it. Examine the dried ball and you will\r\nrecognize in it the cast-off clothes, hat, coat, socks, and boots that\r\nhe had on when he shut himself in. There, too, is the brown shell he\r\nwore as a pupa. You may think you know these things by reading about\r\nthem, but you do not, really. Hearsay is not the real thing in any\r\nrealm of life, least of all in the realm of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMAKING COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS\r\n\r\nCollecting plants has always been an important feature of practical\r\nscientific work. Great sums of money and many years of time have been\r\nspent in searching through little-explored countries for new plants.\r\nAgents of many governments, representatives of great nursery companies\r\nof this and other countries are all the time looking, looking, often\r\nat the cost of the greatest hardship, for new plants. Why is this? Not\r\nas you will readily conclude, merely to add new specimens to museum\r\ncollections, nor merely to find and name a new species, though some\r\ncollectors are in the field for these purely scientific reasons.\r\nBut our Department of Agriculture is on the lookout for new plants\r\nfrom foreign parts which will be commercially valuable to us. Our\r\nenterprising nurserymen are after the same game. At the present time\r\nvery great interest is being taken in plants from western China, a\r\nvast and little-explored region. Strangely enough, the plants from\r\nthat far away country seem to be peculiarly fitted to thrive here, and\r\nwhile the government and the nurserymen are telling the people about\r\nthese new plants, the botanists are trying to discover the reasons why\r\nAsiatic plants fit our conditions better than the plants of Europe seem\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe making of collections of plants, then, is a big, important work,\r\nand well worth the while of any boy or girl. If you would read\r\nstories of exciting adventures, narrow escapes, thrilling encounters\r\namid romantic surroundings, read some of the accounts of scientific\r\nexplorations. The collectors of plants and insects in the Philippines,\r\nCentral Asia, little-known islands of the far East, and such \"wild\r\nnations,\" must needs be men of valour, and to know any one of them is a\r\nliberal education.\r\n\r\nMaking a collection of plants is probably not the best way to arouse\r\nan interest in outdoor life. Indeed it was made such a deadly dull\r\nbusiness for me that my early interest was entirely \"nipped in the bud\"\r\nand lay dormant many, many years. Collecting is one of the recognized\r\nand useful ways of introducing ourselves to our neighbours of the\r\nvegetable kingdom. Living in a plant-infested world as we are elected\r\nto do, eating plants, wearing their products, utilizing them in all\r\nour arts, buying and selling them daily, unable to get through an hour\r\nof the day without being constantly reminded of our entire dependence\r\nupon the members of the vegetable kingdom, what is more natural than\r\nthat we should wish to know them? To know their names is not the end\r\nand aim of plant study. The name is a convenient handle for a plant.\r\nIt enables you to talk about the plant to others without the necessity\r\nof a lengthy description. It enables you to read understandingly what\r\nother students have said about the plant in books. It is only the\r\nbeginning, like the introduction to a stranger. To make of a stranger a\r\nfriend, you must know something of his family, of his relation to the\r\nrest of the world, how he lives, gets a living, how he makes use of his\r\nfaculties, what are his peculiarities, his habits, his environment,\r\nin fact all about him. In discovering the name of a plant by use of a\r\nbotanical key you learn a few but not all of these things.\r\n\r\nAs with some people so with some plants, the more you know of them the\r\nless you think of them; the less you wish to have to do with them. Take\r\npoison ivy for an example. Knowing its characteristics you pass it by\r\nwithout touching it. You observe it from afar off, so as to be able to\r\nwarn others of its whereabouts. On the other hand, if you had only\r\nknown well the giant puff-ball you so wantonly crushed under your heel,\r\nyou might have enjoyed a delicious supper of creamed mushrooms.\r\n\r\nMaking a collection of plants is an extremely simple job. The materials\r\nneeded are not expensive nor hard to get. Here is a list of what is\r\nrequired for a beginner's collection:\r\n\r\n(1) A dozen or so newspapers.\r\n\r\n(2) Driers, two or three dozen, 12 × 18 inches.\r\n\r\n(3) Two boards, 12 × 18 inches.\r\n\r\n(4) A stone of twenty to thirty pounds weight.\r\n\r\n(5) Mounting paper.\r\n\r\n(6) Genus covers.\r\n\r\nCut the newspapers into half sheets. Each specimen is to be placed in a\r\nfolded piece of this. The driers may be cheap blotting paper or pieces\r\nof carpet felt, cut to the desired size.\r\n\r\nArrange a specimen just as it was taken from the ground, inside of\r\none of the half pages of newspaper. While it is not desirable to put\r\ntoo much time on the arrangement of each specimen, it is as well to\r\nplace it in a natural position and in such a way that the leaves will\r\nnot lie all over each other and the flowers be crowded so that the\r\nappearance will be awkward. But do not overdo this: if a flower droops\r\nnaturally, do not make it stick upright. With one of the boards as a\r\nfoundation build your pile of pressing plants up as follows: Lay on\r\ntwo or more driers, then a folded newspaper holding a specimen, then a\r\ndrier or two. (If the specimen is a juicy thing, several blotters are\r\nneeded between it and the next one.) Now another specimen, a drier, a\r\nspecimen, etc., until you are through with the day's collecting, or\r\nuntil the pile begins to topple. Finish with a drier, then put on the\r\nother board, and weight it with your big stone.\r\n\r\nThe driers must be changed every day. Do not disturb the specimens, but\r\nlift each folded newspaper from the old to the new pile, building up\r\nwith fresh driers as before. In a week or ten days most plants will be\r\nthoroughly dry. If at all moist they are likely to mould after being\r\nmounted and your work will be spoiled. A dried specimen is brittle and\r\nneeds careful handling.\r\n\r\nMounting paper, to be standard and uniform, should be white, plain\r\npaper of a very heavy quality. It costs a cent a sheet, size eleven\r\nand one half by sixteen and one fourth inches. No other size would be\r\nacceptable if you wish at some later time to donate your collection to\r\nthe local museum or to sell it to some school.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of fastening specimens to the sheet. Some\r\nlike to use little strips of gummed paper or court-plaster, but\r\nold-fashioned glue is about the most satisfactory stuff. It is mussy to\r\nwork with till you get your hand in, but it holds the plants fast to\r\nthe sheet, and \"that's the intintion.\" It is best to keep the specimens\r\nin the newspaper wrappers until you have a lot ready to mount. Then\r\nwith a pot of glue, a dry cloth, a damp one, and a small brush you are\r\nready for business. Lift the specimen from the newspaper and lay it\r\nfirst on the mounting sheet to get some idea beforehand of how you will\r\nplace it. You may have to prune it some to get it all on, but this is\r\nnot likely as your drying sheets are the same size as your mounting\r\npaper. Having decided at what angle to place it, lay the specimen back\r\non the newspaper upside down. With your brush wet, but not dripping,\r\nwith glue, brush the stems, buds, leaves, and flowers lightly over the\r\nback. Lift it again, turning it over as you transfer it to the white\r\nsheet. With a light pressure make the parts fast and lay the sheet\r\naside for the glue to dry.\r\n\r\nSmall specimens should occupy a place just a little below the centre of\r\nthe sheet, and if more than one specimen is required to show all parts\r\nthey may be arranged on the sheet as their various shapes and sizes\r\nlook best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plants should be mounted on paper 16¼ × 11½ inches]\r\n\r\nA few facts should accompany each plant to refresh your memory of that\r\nspecimen when you come to study it later. These facts should have been\r\nrecorded by you in whatever way you like and referred to the specimen\r\nby a number while in the press. Finally each mounted specimen should\r\nhave its label, bearing the name of the plant, the collector's name,\r\nthe date collected, locality, and any useful information regarding it.\r\nGlue the label into the lower right-hand corner, which should always be\r\nreserved for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThese loose sheets, covered with mounted specimens, must not be allowed\r\nto lie in a shelf or drawer unprotected. Each group of them should be\r\nput into a folded sheet of manilla paper. Such a holder is called a\r\n\"genus cover.\" Its size, folded, is eleven and three fourths by sixteen\r\nand one half inches.\r\n\r\nThis word \"genus\" suggests that in time the collector is going to be\r\nable so to classify his specimens that each genus cover may contain\r\nonly plants so closely related one to another that they are of the same\r\nbotanical genus. The beginner need not be seriously disturbed if there\r\nare many plants in his collection that he does not know the names of\r\nyet. The collection is for study or it is worth nothing. Knowing plants\r\nis more important than knowing names. You cannot handle plants much\r\nand observe them in their places without noticing how different they\r\nare. Then you begin to see that some are more like than others. This\r\nis the beginning of classification. You need not know even the common\r\nnames of the plants to do this, although you will know some, of course.\r\nProfessor Bailey says: \"Learn first to classify plants; names will\r\nfollow. Look for resemblances, and group plants round some well-known\r\nkind. Look for sunflower-like plants, lily-like, rose-like, mint-like,\r\nmustard-like, pea-like, carrot-like plants. These great groups are\r\nfamilies.\"\r\n\r\nAfter you have handled your common plants a good deal you will be\r\nsurprised to find how easily you can guess at one's family, and guess\r\nright.\r\n\r\nWhen you have reached this stage in your collecting you will feel that\r\nyou need some book to guide you and act as a check on your studies. All\r\nthe books mentioned in the lists in this book are useful for beginners.\r\nIf you find a book which pretends to take the place of the plants\r\nthemselves, you would better throw your money away than buy it. Instead\r\nof helping it will hinder your progress. You will find in beginners'\r\nbotanies what is known as a \"key.\" Now, a key is obviously to unlock\r\nsomething with. If you had a door key which turned with difficulty, or\r\nfitted the lock imperfectly you would be sure to have it repaired or\r\nget a more modern one. Some of the old botanical keys seem to be rusty\r\nand it is difficult to use them. Choose the key that works most easily.\r\n\r\nIn making a key for classifying plants one begins by dividing the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom into two big departments, thus:\r\n\r\nA. Plants which never have flowers.\r\n\r\nAA. Plants which do have flowers.\r\n\r\nAs your specimens are all of the flowering kind we shall for the\r\npresent forget all about the others and begin to divide our big group\r\nAA into smaller groups. This is how it is done:\r\n\r\nAA. Flowering plants.\r\n\r\nB. Flowers not showy, seeds in cones (usually), leaves needle--or\r\nscale-like, evergreen (usually).\r\n\r\nBB. Flowers showy, seeds not in cones, leaves of various shapes,\r\ndeciduous (usually).\r\n\r\nYou will see that in dividing a group it is important that A is just\r\nthe opposite of AA, and B is just the opposite of BB, and that the\r\nplace to look for BB is just the same distance over from the margin\r\nof the page as B although it may not be on the same page, if there\r\nare a great many divisions under B. These little things make the key\r\neasier to use than the old-fashioned ones were. Some people still use\r\nbotanical keys as mental gymnastics but I do not believe in that. After\r\nall you are studying plants not keys.\r\n\r\nYou will want to go back to the group we called A, for to the\r\nnon-flowering plants belong the lovely ferns which must certainly\r\ngrace your collection. This is a delightful group to study and it is\r\npossible with a reasonable amount of persistence and by exchanging with\r\nfern collectors in other parts of the country to get a very nearly if\r\nnot quite, complete collection of native forms. Only one hundred and\r\nsixty-five of the four thousand species of ferns are native to the\r\nUnited States. Such a collection should be very valuable.\r\n\r\nSome boys and girls lose interest in collecting plants after the first\r\nseason, especially if they have done well the first year and secured\r\nmost of the species in their locality. If the opportunity to collect\r\nelsewhere does not come the next spring there can be nothing more\r\ninteresting than to try to get the same things you already have, but\r\nin some other stage of their growth. For example: most collections\r\nwill have several kinds of violets, blue, white and yellow, in all the\r\nbeauty of their flowering. But whoever thought of getting one that\r\nshowed the seed pods? What is a violet's seed pod like anyhow? Is the\r\nseed pod of the white one like that of the yellow? Are the seed pods\r\nof one plant all alike? When do the pods open and how? How do the\r\nseeds germinate and when? These and other questions are waiting to be\r\nanswered by every plant in your collection. Would it not be fine to\r\nknow the pure white trillium in midsummer when it has grown a leaf\r\nnearly a foot across and has a red fleshy seed case thrust up where it\r\nwill be conspicuous? Some plants are far more showy in fruit than in\r\nflower and you will begin to see why these and other things are true as\r\nyou carry on your studies throughout the year.\r\n\r\nMany a teacher of botany is forced to depend upon pictures when she\r\nwishes to teach children to discriminate between two kinds of leaves,\r\nkinds of roots, kinds of stems, kinds of inflorescence. What a boon\r\nto those teachers would be a collection put up to illustrate the\r\nlessons as they came along! I wonder if there is not a market for such\r\ncollections in schools where no herbariums are made or kept.\r\n\r\nFor little children, making blue prints is delightful occupation. I\r\nknew a child of four who learned to recognize the leaves of most of the\r\ncommon trees one spring by means of this work, and she did every bit\r\nof it alone. A small printing frame, blue print paper of the required\r\nsize, and plenty of water is all that is required. A child soon learns\r\nto use good judgment in printing, exposing the frame just long enough\r\nto get a fine blue. The outline of the leaf comes out distinctly in\r\nwhite against a blue background. The prints should be thoroughly washed\r\nand may be dried on panes of glass.\r\n\r\nThe blue prints of leaves and of flowers do not show anything but the\r\noutlines, of course. Leaf prints of other kinds are made which bring\r\nout the veining as well. The outfit for this work is simple. Two print\r\nrollers, a pane of glass, and a tube of printers' ink, sheets of paper\r\nto print upon, and leaves. Put a small quantity of the ink on the clean\r\nglass, and work it into a thin film over the surface. Lay a leaf upon\r\nthis film of ink and go over it with the inky roller. Transfer the\r\nleaf to a sheet of paper and cover with a second sheet. One whirl of\r\nthe clean roller ought to give you the desired print. It is surprising\r\nhow delicate and true these are and how perfectly they show the\r\ncharacteristic margin, indentations, venation, and even something of\r\nthe texture of each leaf. A little practice makes one able to make\r\nimpressions which are like leaf shadows, so delicate and lace-like can\r\nthese prints be made. It is an excellent way of fixing the leaf forms\r\nin the memory, as well as in the note-book.\r\n\r\nIn making a collection of plants the same \"rules of the game\" should\r\nhold good as in collecting insects and other natural objects. Take only\r\nwhat you need. Do not uproot and leave to die the near neighbours of\r\nthe specimens you select. The taking of rare specimens is discouraged.\r\nI shall never forget the look of indignation our dear old professor\r\ngave an ambitious youth who had uprooted for his paltry collection\r\nevery plant of a species of rare fern which the professor had been\r\ntrying for years to re-establish in its old location. After all is said\r\nand done, a live plant is better than a dead one. This is all a part\r\nof the great spirit of conservation that has so taken possession of\r\nour people of late years. Out of these little acts of preserving our\r\nresources will grow a more beautiful America and a better appreciation\r\nof all things beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING SEA-WEEDS\r\n\r\nEvery child ought to be familiar with that musical poem of Percival's\r\nbeginning:\r\n\r\n    \"Deep in the sea is a coral grove,\r\n    Where the purple mullet and goldfish rove.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then when the child grows bigger he should have an opportunity to\r\ngo out in a glass-bottomed boat, at Santa Catalina Island or elsewhere,\r\nand see for himself that those \"yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean,\"\r\n\"bending like corn on the upland lea,\" are not pictures from a poet's\r\ndream, but beautiful realities.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds are exquisite things and few people can resist the temptation\r\nto collect them when spending a vacation at the beach. When going on\r\na collecting trip for these it is well to take a net and two pails,\r\none small enough to hold the smaller things and carried inside the\r\nlarger. A heavy knife may be useful, too. The best time is after the\r\nspring-tides, because at the lowest ebb of the water one may find\r\nforms of great beauty and brighter colours than elsewhere. The rocks,\r\nthe rubbish left by the tide, the pools, the piles, the sea-wall,\r\nthe surface of the waves themselves, are all good places to look for\r\nsea-weeds. They are fewer on sandy beaches than elsewhere. They vary in\r\nsize from great, coarse, leathery rock-weeds to those so delicate as\r\nhardly to be seen at all.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds are real plants, belonging to that great group of\r\nnon-flowering plants mentioned before. They are called algæ. They do\r\nnot have true stems and leaves, neither do they feed by means of roots.\r\nMany of them are so shaped that they appear to have stems, roots, and\r\nleaves, but as these parts do not do the work of true stems, roots, and\r\nleaves they are not classed as such. The root-like parts of a sea weed\r\nare usually simply hold-fasts, which anchor the plant to the rocks.\r\nAlgæ which live in sea-water get their nourishment from the water which\r\nwashes their entire surface.\r\n\r\nWhen collecting algæ, every specimen which is intended for immediate\r\nmounting should be kept continuously in sea-water. This is what\r\nthe pails are for. Every part of the plant should be taken, as the\r\nattachment to the rocks is as valuable as the rest. The knife is useful\r\nhere, or a staff with a metal point, for scraping the weeds off the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe natural element of the sea plant is sea-water. Do not put your\r\nspecimens into fresh water even to wash or rinse them, as they will\r\nlose some of their beauty. Unless dried soon after gathering they will\r\ndecay and fade. In collecting, try and get plants of various sizes even\r\nthough they look alike. The larger ones may be in the fruiting stage.\r\nDo your mounting out of doors if possible, where you can have all the\r\nbasins of sea-water you want and need not be careful about spilling.\r\n\r\nIf your collection of sea weeds is for a regular herbarium you should\r\nby all means have mounting paper of the standard size and quality;\r\nheavy white, unruled paper, of a quality which will stand wetting\r\nwithout being spoiled, eleven and one half by sixteen and one fourth\r\ninches. If you are merely making a few souvenirs of your summer at the\r\nshore, your own taste is the only thing to be considered. You will\r\nrequire genus covers, labels, etc., just as for flowering plants.\r\nFor the work of mounting you will want plenty of driers, some pieces\r\nof muslin the same size, sheets of standard size mounting paper as\r\ndescribed above, a heavy needle fitted into a wooden handle, a pair\r\nof forceps, scissors, two smooth boards, and weights. For complete\r\nenjoyment of the work you will surely have a little magnifying glass,\r\nfor your pressed specimens will never be as beautiful as the fresh ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sea weed mounted on paper of standard size]\r\n\r\nWith several shallow dishes of sea-water within easy reach of your\r\nhands, and your pails of specimens floating in sea-water, you are ready\r\nto begin. Select your first specimen and lift it with care from the\r\nwater. Dip it up and down gently in clean water. Every bit of matter\r\nthat does not belong strictly to that plant must come off, and all\r\nthe sand or other dirt. Let it spread out naturally in the water and\r\nwith your scissors prune it to suit your purpose. Some grow in such a\r\nbunch that they will not show well on the paper, others may have to be\r\ntrimmed to get them onto the page. Do not, of course, trim them down\r\nto look alike but preserve their peculiarities and characteristics.\r\nThe great charm in a collection of this kind is in its variety. When\r\nthe plant is absolutely clean, float it in a dish of clean water. This\r\nlast dish should be a broad one for now you are to slip your sheet of\r\nmounting paper right into the water and get the plant onto it, floating\r\nit out in a natural attitude. This takes a knack, you may be sure, but\r\nthe knack can be acquired with practice. If you can provide yourself\r\nwith a pane of glass to lay the sheet upon when you take it from the\r\nwater you will have the best conditions. Some people get along very\r\nwell with a shallow plate. Some of the delicate parts will be certain\r\nto cling together as you lift them out of the water, but you can remedy\r\nthat by dipping a few drops of water onto them and with your needle you\r\ncan arrange them as you wish. Take your time. This is not a job for a\r\nperson in a hurried mood. Examine and admire each piece as you work at\r\nit. Make it yours for all time, although you may sell it the following\r\nday and never see it again. Lay one of your driers on the lower board,\r\nput a mounted specimen all wet as it is, on this, then spread over the\r\nsheet a piece of muslin, lay on another drier, mount another sea-weed,\r\ncover it with cloth and so on you may build up your pile. Top it with a\r\ndrier, put on the second board, and your weight, of ten pounds or so.\r\nCoarse, thick algæ should not be pressed in the same pile with the fine\r\nones as they would make the pressure uneven. Blotters and cloths must\r\nbe changed every day at first, dried in the sun to be ready for the\r\nnext day. After two or three days the cloths may be taken off, and the\r\nplants left in press at least a week longer, changing driers every day.\r\nIf you can set aside a regular time each day for this job, it is not so\r\nlikely to be forgotten. Moulding specimens are very disappointing.\r\n\r\nAfter one has made a little collection of sea-weeds all the stories\r\nabout the wonders of the deep will take on a reality. You will want to\r\nread all you can find about the Sargasso Sea, which sounds like a fairy\r\nstory. Maybe you have a specimen of this sea-weed in your collection,\r\nmaybe you have been fortunate enough to sail through that \"vast acreage\r\nof vegetation as large as the continent of Europe, lying southwest of\r\nthe Azores!\" Do you wonder that the first navigators, sailing uncharted\r\nseas, were alarmed by this vast expanse and thought of course there\r\nwere concealed shallows beneath the feathery fronds of this gulf weed?\r\nYou must read, too, of some of the giants of the sea-weed tribe; the\r\n\"devil's apron,\" the \"sea-otter's cabbage,\" with its air-vessel as big\r\nas a hogshead, and its stalk a slender cord hundreds of feet in length.\r\nThese are all algæ, and so are the microscopic plants which produce\r\nthat wonderful phosphorescence on the surface of the ocean. There\r\nare still unsolved mysteries about these plants and there is always\r\na chance that the boys and girls who collect sea-weeds to-day on the\r\nbeach may in the years to come read some of the secrets now hidden from\r\nall eyes. It is well worth while to keep such a big thought in mind\r\neven while doing the simple and easy work of mounting specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING SHELLS\r\n\r\nOf all the kinds of collections of natural objects that I have seen,\r\nthere is none that has quite so much beauty, in itself, as a collection\r\nof shells. How easily they can be displayed in a cabinet for our\r\nfriends to enjoy, too, and they are never attacked, so far as I know,\r\nby what we call museum pests, those destructive little creatures which\r\nmake life a burden to the owners of collections of insects, plants,\r\nstuffed birds, and the like. Perhaps the products of the sea possess an\r\nespecial charm to the \"landlubber,\" but most people admire shells and\r\nlove to handle them and to wonder where they came from and what kind of\r\ncreatures built them.\r\n\r\nDid any one ever visit the shore and come home without a pocket\r\nbulging with shells? Or a big handful tied up in a grimy handkerchief?\r\nProbably that is the way most of the great collections in the country\r\nwere begun. You can begin one this summer or any time that you visit a\r\nbeach, and add to it daily if you are spending the summer on the shore.\r\nAs your collection and your interest grow, you can exchange specimens\r\ncommon on your coast with collectors who live on the other oceans and\r\nthe Gulf. Remember that every shell is rare until you get it in your\r\ncabinet and what is common as the sand on your coast may be a rarity in\r\nother parts of the world.\r\n\r\nYou will probably begin your collection by picking up empty shells\r\nof various sizes, colours and shapes. Sometimes you will find a pair\r\nstill held together by the tough tendon that worked the hinge when the\r\nbivalve that built the shell was alive and going about his affairs.\r\nMany of these will be worn by their daily encounter with the tide, and\r\nsome will be pierced with small round holes too neatly ground to have\r\nbeen made by accident. These holes give you a hint as to why this shell\r\nis empty for they are the work of a band of little pirates which live\r\nby boring into their neighbours and sucking their life-blood. Many of\r\nthe dead shells are those of animals which live far out at sea or in\r\nthe deep water and have been washed ashore when the tide was high.\r\nSearch along the shore where the water has drifted a line of sea-wrack.\r\nIt looks like rubbish at first glance but it is almost sure to hold\r\nmany small shells you will want, some even from far-off coasts.\r\n\r\nThe collector will not long be satisfied to gather only such shells\r\nas he finds on the beach. His eyes are opened. What seemed to him at\r\nfirst a flat, smooth surface of sand strewn with bits of rubbish and\r\na few shells, most of them not worth picking up, has awakened into\r\nlife. Every pool has become as a village, its inhabitants engaged in\r\na variety of occupations. The smooth sand is inhabited. The centre of\r\npopulation is down at the low-water line. The rocks, the bridge piers,\r\nthe wharf piles, and the sea-walls are seen to be covered with living\r\nthings. Now collecting begins in good earnest.\r\n\r\nOn the sandy beach one needs a net, a sieve, and a shovel. The best\r\ncostume for such work is the same as that worn when bathing. You will\r\nneed to be in the water part of the time and will not wish to be\r\nhampered by anxiety as to clothing. The best time to go is the time\r\nyou can go, of course, but you are more likely to find a great variety\r\nof things at the very lowest tide. You have heard of planting \"by the\r\nmoon\" and you are right in supposing that the moon has little influence\r\non potatoes and cabbages. But to go collecting on the sea-shore \"by the\r\nmoon\" is quite reasonable. When the moon is full and when it is new\r\nthey have what are called spring tides at which times the ebb is lower\r\nthan ordinarily. After a storm is a fine time to look for things which\r\nhave been dragged by the force of the water from their anchorage in the\r\ndepths, and tossed ashore.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive on the sand all will appear to be quiet. Your best\r\nplan is to sit still and wait for some signs of life. In a moment some\r\nclam may send a jet of water into the air near you. If you are quick\r\nenough with your shovel you may catch the joker, but he has had more\r\npractice in the game than you and will probably elude you. Watch for\r\nbubbles and jets of water and dig frantically. You will be able to work\r\nup speed after a few trials and land your \"fish.\" After some practice\r\nyou will be able to unearth many living things you little suspected of\r\nbeing there. Crabs of various kinds are common and sea-worms of rainbow\r\ncolours and curious forms. Creatures in snail-like shells, little and\r\nbig, are common in the sand of our coast. As you shovel away try to\r\nhave presence of mind enough to throw the sand into your sieve. Take\r\nthis to the water's edge and wash it. You will in this way get many\r\nsmall things which you otherwise would not see.\r\n\r\nDo not discard anything about which you have an unanswered question.\r\nMany of the mollusks leave egg cases on the sand or these are washed\r\nin by the tides. They are no less wonderful than the shells, for they\r\nare chapters in the same story. The egg-cases of the whelk are common.\r\nThose of the skate are called \"devil's pocket-books\" by natives.\r\n\r\nMuddy shores have their own special forms, while rocky coasts differ\r\nfrom all the rest. Some creatures, like the hermit crab, are abundant\r\neverywhere. You can read the story of this fellow in any book on\r\nshells. Take some of the stories about him with a grain of salt. He\r\nmay not be as bad as he is painted for much of the gossip about him has\r\nnever been proven. His affairs need investigation.\r\n\r\nThe creatures which build the shells are for the most part soft\r\nbodied and can not be preserved except in some liquid like alcohol or\r\nformalin. These would be difficult to transport but will be of greatest\r\nvalue if you are studying the structure of the mollusks. If you wish to\r\npreserve the shells only, you should take great care to free every part\r\nfrom any animal matter that adheres to them. Boiling the shell will\r\nusually accomplish this.\r\n\r\nLabels should be used and record made of the locality, date,\r\ncollector's name, and other interesting data. Every naturalist of any\r\nexperience has the note-book habit. Many a collector who trusts to\r\nhis memory finds himself sadly at a loss when he comes to work with\r\nhis specimens and especially when he wants to write about them. If\r\nhis note-book tells him the story he will be able to make his account\r\naccurate as well as interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe two principal reasons for making insect collections are first,\r\nto study, second, to sell. The beginner's outfit will be the same\r\nwhichever reason is his. Time was when any one carrying an insect net\r\nwas looked on with a sort of pitying suspicion. He or she was thought\r\nto be the victim of a mild form of lunacy, which might or might not\r\ntake violent shape. All that is past now that insect study has grown so\r\nimportant and popular. It is quite safe to conclude that the hundreds\r\nof trained scientists employed by the government to investigate the\r\nproblems involving insect life all started their studies by making a\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nProbably the easiest kind of collection to make is one of plants.\r\nOnce you see them, their fate is sealed. Escape is impossible. But\r\ncollecting wild plants about your own door yard and in the woods is\r\ntame work compared to insect capturing. Your eye marks a butterfly or\r\na dragon fly for your own, but you have him yet to reckon with and his\r\nwings may carry him far beyond your reach.\r\n\r\nThe outfit necessary to an insect collector is simple and inexpensive.\r\nFor general collecting, and that is the best for a beginner, you need:\r\n\r\n1. A net.\r\n\r\n2. A killing bottle.\r\n\r\n3. Insect pins.\r\n\r\n4. Insect boxes.\r\n\r\nWhile you can add to your collection almost every day in the year\r\nwhen once \"you have the fever,\" the best time to begin is summer. More\r\ninsects are in evidence then, and their active flight, their beautiful\r\ncolours, and wonderful variety of form all help arouse the interest. As\r\nthe collection grows you will find that many insects can be captured\r\nwithout a net, but as you will want every new butterfly, moth, dragon\r\nfly, and grasshopper that comes into your line of vision you must\r\ncertainly have a net the first thing.\r\n\r\nThe materials needed for a net are these:\r\n\r\n1. A smooth, light, but strong handle about three feet in length. (An\r\nold broom handle will answer.)\r\n\r\n2. A strip of tin, four inches wide, and long enough to fit around the\r\nhandle. (Why not use a piece of a tin can if you have strong shears?)\r\n\r\n3. Three and a half feet of heavy wire. (No. 3 galvanized is the thing.)\r\n\r\n4. A piece of cheese cloth, three fourths of a yard. (Get a good grade\r\nto stand a season's wear.)\r\n\r\nAlmost every boy knows a tinsmith and when it comes to putting these\r\nmaterials together, the services of a skilled workman are very\r\nvaluable. If pocket money is scarce, there are any number of jobs a boy\r\ncan do for the tinsmith in exchange for his help in making the net.\r\nThat piece of wire is to form the ring which holds the cheese cloth\r\nbag; the ring must be fastened securely into the end of the handle.\r\nBend the wire into a circle a foot in diameter, then bend back three\r\ninches of both ends and force them into the end of the handle, a hole\r\nfor the purpose first having been made by burning or boring. Bend the\r\ntin round the handle at the net end to keep it from splitting when in\r\nuse, and tack it on tight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Insect net]\r\n\r\nIf you know how to sew you are more fortunate than most of the boys I\r\nknow, although why should not a boy learn to use a sewing machine? The\r\nbag ought to be sewed on the machine. You must first lay the finished\r\nedge or selvedge around the wire to make sure that it goes around and\r\nhas a little extra for the seam. Pin the cloth together where it meets\r\naround the wire, then lay it on a table, double. Cut the bag, rounding\r\nthe bottom neatly. Cheese cloth is the worst stuff to ravel, and if\r\nyou sew the bag with a single seam you will soon be sorry. Pin the\r\ncloth so that the two edges are exactly together and sew a seam about a\r\nquarter of an inch wide all the way round. Now turn the bag inside out\r\nand fold it so that the seam you just made will be right on the edge.\r\nSew another seam, three eighths of an inch deep this time. The ragged\r\nedge of the goods will now be inside of this second seam and can not\r\nfray out and make a nuisance of itself. If all this is worse than Dutch\r\nto you, take the bag to your sister. She is not so much cleverer than\r\nyou but the chances are that if you ask her to sew you a French seam,\r\nshe will make it just as I have described. Sew the finished bag onto\r\nthe wire with heavy double thread and your net is ready for use.\r\n\r\nMaterials to make a killing bottle: 1. A wide-mouthed bottle. (I advise\r\nevery collector to have two bottles, one to carry in the pocket all\r\nthe time, the other for special trips for large things. For the first\r\na small olive oil bottle, a test tube, or any convenient sized bottle\r\nwith a mouth nearly or quite as large as the body of the bottle. A\r\nfruit jar, pint size, does well for the very large things.)\r\n\r\n2. A cork which fits the bottle tightly, and is an inch long. A cork\r\nany shorter than this is an aggravation as it is so unhandy.\r\n\r\n3. A lump of cyanide of potassium as big as a hickory nut for the\r\nsmall bottle, two or a little more for the big bottle. Yes, cyanide\r\nis a deadly poison, and the druggist will not sell it to you and your\r\nfather will not let you buy it. But if you convince your mother that\r\nshe can trust you to use a cyanide bottle as it is intended to be used,\r\nher objections will melt away. Just as likely as not she and your\r\nfather, too, and your teacher, and maybe the druggist all made insect\r\ncollections when they were your age and one or the other will make your\r\ncyanide bottles for you following these directions:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Killing bottle]\r\n\r\n4. A teacup full of plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nHandle the cyanide with a couple of sticks or drop the lumps from the\r\npaper into the bottles so as not to touch them with your fingers, mix a\r\nlittle of the plaster of Paris and water till it is like a thin paste\r\nand pour enough in on the lumps of cyanide to entirely cover them. Put\r\nin on top of this all the dry plaster of Paris the water will take up.\r\nLet the bottle stand open for an hour or so, then wipe it out with a\r\nrag, which may be burned afterward. Put in the cork and your killing\r\nbottle is ready to do its share toward making a collection for you.\r\nDon't forget to label your bottles \"poison,\" and always be careful not\r\nto inhale the fumes. The smell of the breath of the bottle will be\r\nenough to remind you.\r\n\r\nIt was a Japanese student, who, when he found one of his pinned moths\r\nhad come to life and beaten its wings to pieces in the box, said: \"It\r\nought-a be dead. He in cy'ni' bot'l' a' night.\" I should not wish to\r\nbe quite so stoical. His bot'l' was probably an old one, which did its\r\nwork too slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTING INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe first insects I ever saw in a collection were a sorry sight.\r\nBeautiful as the specimens had been, they were all spoiled by the\r\ncollector. The moths were all out of shape, wings half folded, the\r\npins used were short common pins, and every specimen was disfigured\r\nwith masses of verdigris, they were pinned into rough boxes in\r\nhiggledy-piggledy fashion, and showed every sign of neglect and\r\ncareless handling. My interest in insect collecting did not date from\r\nthat hour but from a look I had at a friend's cabinet years later.\r\n\r\nThe first mistake a beginner makes is to use common pins. Really,\r\nbefore you begin to collect, you ought to send away for a supply of\r\nGerman insect pins. These can be bought from dealers in entomological\r\nsupplies and a hundred each of Nos. 3 and 5 will cost thirty cents.\r\nWith them your collection may be salable, and you may exchange your\r\nduplicates with other collectors, while if you use common pins your\r\nspecimens will have no commercial value, and will soon be spoiled, by\r\nthe corroding of the pins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-section of spreading-board, showing construction]\r\n\r\nThe first insect you get will probably be a butterfly, or a moth, for\r\nthese showy ones are all you are able to see. Later the smaller ones\r\nwill attract your attention. Therefore you will not be able to mount\r\nyour first specimen properly without a spreading-board. The drawing of\r\none which appears on this page will tell you more about how to make as\r\nwell as how to use it than any amount of description. If you can earn\r\nseventy-five cents more easily than by making a set of three of these\r\nin assorted sizes, you can buy for that amount an adjustable one which\r\nwill serve you for all winged insects of all sizes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spreading-board, in use]\r\n\r\nI will suppose that you have captured your first butterfly. Do get a\r\ngood sized one first as it will be easier to learn on that than on a\r\nsmall one. An hour in a freshly made cyanide jar is long enough to\r\ninsure a painless death. If any one calls you a cruel boy at this time,\r\nassure the person that butterflies are very short-lived and that this\r\none would have been eaten by a bird within an hour or two anyhow. The\r\ncyanide is the least painful form of dying for the butterfly. Its work\r\nis probably done, already. You can prove that you do not kill insects\r\nfor the fun of seeing them die, by putting the bottle back in your\r\npocket where they can die in private, and by never killing any unless\r\nyou need them for your collection. A few duplicates for exchange is\r\nalso legitimate. It does not injure a specimen to leave it in the jar\r\nover night. If you cannot spread it immediately, do not take it from\r\nthe jar, as when dried they cannot be spread, as they are very brittle.\r\n\r\nIf you never looked at a butterfly before, you will look at this one.\r\nYou will note that it has four broad wings attached to a rounded body.\r\nThe portion of the body to which the wings are fastened is called the\r\nthorax. For a medium-sized insect, a No. 3 pin should be taken. The\r\nbutterfly should be pinned through the thorax, half way between the\r\nfront wings. Direct the pin so that it will come out in the middle on\r\nthe under side of the thorax. One fourth of the pin's length should\r\nremain above the insect. This may seem a small matter but insects\r\nunevenly pinned look badly, and it spoils their salability. You will\r\nwant some black-headed pins for use on the spreading-board. Common\r\npins hurt the fingers, insect pins are too flexible and expensive.\r\nPin strips of paper on to hold the wings in place. With the picture\r\nof butterflies on a spreading-board as a model, you will, after some\r\nexperience, get so that you can do this well. It is no job for an\r\nimpatient person, though. Leave the butterfly on the board until it is\r\nthoroughly dry, which takes three days. Put the board where the air can\r\nhave free circulation around it, but not the mice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing how to pin common insects]\r\n\r\nThe only insects that are not pinned through the middle of the thorax\r\nare the beetles, those hard-shelled creatures like June bugs (which\r\nought to be called May beetles), and potato bugs (which are also\r\nbeetles). If you put a pin through the centre of a beetle's thorax, it\r\nspreads the wings out in an unnatural way. So collectors agree to pin\r\nthem through the right wing-cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pin butterflies through the thorax, between the front\r\npair of wings]\r\n\r\nYour next requirement will be boxes to put the specimens in. Many a\r\nfine collection has been begun in ordinary cigar boxes. At first you\r\nwill probably try to pin the insects right into the bottom of the box.\r\nAfter you have spoiled two or three of your rarest ones, bent a dozen\r\nor so expensive pins, you will conclude that the wood is too hard and\r\ndoes not hold the pins well. Be warned in time to save yourself this\r\nbother. The boxes should be lined with a thin layer of some material\r\nwhich, though soft enough to push a pin into easily, must at the same\r\ntime be elastic and firm enough to hold the pins. Cork, linoleum, and\r\nslices of pith are all used. You may have noticed, though, if you have\r\nbeen to a large, up-to-date museum, that the specimens of insects\r\nare all pinned into solid blocks of wood. Many an hour I have spent\r\npinning specimens into blocks in their permanent places in a great\r\nmuseum collection. It is hard work and has to be done with a tool.\r\nWhen once fastened on a block the insect is supposed to be a fixture;\r\nwhen it moves the block goes along. But the material you use in your\r\nboxes ought to be soft enough to make shifting of specimens easy. For\r\nexample, at first you will get a great assortment. A butterfly to-day,\r\na beetle or two to-morrow, a pair of moths the next day, some crickets,\r\na dragon fly, a cicada, a waterbug, and so on. Take everything unless\r\nyou already have it. That is the only way to collect. If you say, \"Oh,\r\nI'll get a better one to-morrow,\" the chances are that the season will\r\ngo by and you will not get that variety at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glass-topped insect case]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nYour first box full will be a varied assortment. When you have all you\r\ncan conveniently pin into three boxes without crowding, you will want\r\nto arrange them. If you have begun to study science you will know what\r\n\"classify\" means. Every school is made up of classes. So with insects.\r\nYou will know by the looks of the insects that certain ones belong\r\ntogether. A good way to start is to put all the butterflies and moths\r\ninto one box. You may not know what you have done, but you have simply\r\nseparated the members of the order _Lepidoptera_ from all the others.\r\nLook over those that are left and you will see that some, like the\r\nblundering June bug, have their wings so placed that a straight line\r\nappears down the middle of the back. These belong together, regardless\r\nof their colour, size, shape, habits, or other considerations. They\r\nbelong to the order _Coleoptera_. Grasshoppers, katydids, and crickets\r\nbelong to another group and can be pinned together. All the flies have\r\ntwo wings, and belong in a group apart from all the four-winged ones.\r\nThe dragon flies go together. You will have representatives of other\r\norders, less easy to distinguish, but by the time your collection has\r\ngrown to this extent you will be ready for some beginner's book on\r\nentomology, which will make further classification simple enough. As\r\nyou shift your specimens from one box to another observe a certain\r\nregularity of arrangement. The heads should all point in one direction.\r\nWhen pinning a group all of which are about one size, set the pins all\r\nin line, in military fashion. How much better they look! This neat,\r\nformal arrangement of the specimens adds greatly to your satisfaction\r\nand enjoyment of your collection. Avoid crowding and breakage. A dried\r\nspecimen is almost everlasting, but at the same time it is the most\r\nfragile thing you can imagine.\r\n\r\nAs your collection grows in size, value, and interest, you will\r\ncertainly want wooden cases. Perhaps your manual training teacher will\r\nbe willing to let you build a box under his direction. A cabinet-maker\r\ncan make them at one dollar or less, apiece, of well-seasoned basswood.\r\n\r\nBefore you have been collecting long, you will have learned by\r\nobservation quite a lot about insects and their ways. You will know\r\nthat some localities are very poor collecting ground, that other places\r\nyield an abundant variety; that the best time for butterflies is in\r\na sunny forenoon; while moths are abroad in the early twilight and\r\nlater. You will see that dragon flies are fond of flying about over\r\nstreams or ponds and you may wonder why as you try in vain to net a\r\nfine one without getting your feet wet. Other insects are frankly\r\naquatic and you can get them only by dipping your net in. It is well\r\nto have a second net if you expect to do much water collecting as the\r\ncloth is hard to smooth out after a wetting. As a majority of insects\r\nare vegetarian you will naturally seek among plants for specimens. If\r\nthe winged forms are not eating the foliage you may discover that they\r\nare laying eggs on the leaves of the food plant on which their young\r\nmust develop. If you live in town you will find it worth while to carry\r\nyour bottle with you when you go out in the evening. Nocturnal insects\r\nof all kinds are attracted to electric lights, many of them to their\r\ndeath, as you will see. A candle in your open window will attract some\r\nvaluable additions to your collection and also some you will sleep\r\nbetter without. Some collectors care nothing for a specimen unless it\r\nis rare. A better way is to regard them all as rare until you secure\r\na specimen for your box, and of equal value towards building up a\r\ncomplete collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIFE HISTORY COLLECTION\r\n\r\nYou can not collect insects very long before you begin to see a lot\r\nof things you never noticed before. You see leaves cut or eaten in\r\nstrange forms, or you find a cluster of tiny eggs on a leaf, or several\r\nleaves sewed or stuck together with strands of silk. Perhaps you find\r\nstrange abnormal growths on certain plants, swellings on their stems,\r\nleaves transformed into balls, or pod-like or cone-like affairs which\r\ndo not look natural. These things are sure to arouse your curiosity.\r\nSometimes the answer to your question is right there. Cut open a\r\nswollen golden-rod stalk and you will find the culprit which caused the\r\nplant to grow that way. But how did the footless, helpless grub get\r\nthere and when? You break down the mud-dauber wasp's nest from among\r\nthe rafters of some building. What is that yellowish object that rolls\r\nfrom among the ruined adobe walls? Look! It is a spider. What business\r\nhas a spider in the wasp's nest, if it is her nest? Spiders have none\r\ntoo good a reputation, but this spider does not act very spry. Seems to\r\nbe alive, yet not alive.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the relation between the spiders and the wasps you can\r\nread in many a book. You might even guess at it, but there was no guess\r\nwork about the observer who first studied out this secret. He did not\r\nget his knowledge from books. He patiently watched the mud-dauber going\r\nabout her house building. He knew that her painstaking labour could\r\nhave but one meaning. She was building not a home for herself, but for\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nThe wasp's children are not little wasps, yet they are none the less\r\nyoung wasps for being footless, colourless, wingless, stingless grubs.\r\nThey are eggs at first of course, just as all insects are. When the\r\nmother wasp has one cell of her apartment house finished she concerns\r\nherself immediately with stocking the larder. Knowing the tastes of her\r\nyet unborn young, she leaves for a time the mud hole, and visits the\r\nhaunts of certain spiders. Finding one to her liking, she captures it.\r\nNot appreciating the fact that the law forbids the use of preservatives\r\nin meats, she injects a drop of some wonder-working fluid into the\r\nspider and preserves the creature, not only fresh but alive, though\r\nparalyzed. Upon the inert body she places an egg, then seals the cell,\r\nwell assured in her mind that when the grub hatches it will find the\r\nfood just as she left it and just enough to nourish the young one to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nBefore your first season of collecting is past you will find yourself\r\nbringing home as specimens many insects which you will see are not\r\nfully grown. Little grasshoppers, scarcely bigger than a fly yet\r\npossessed of such strength of leg that they can hurl themselves into\r\nthe air for a distance equal to twenty times their own length. How do\r\nyou know that they are young grasshoppers and not fully grown ones of\r\nsome tiny race? Look at one closely and you will see a look of youth\r\nabout him that is unmistakable. He is fuzzy, his head is too big for\r\nhim, his legs out of all proportion to the rest of him. Then, too,\r\nhe has no wings, just little buds where the wings will be some day.\r\nBy these tokens you will know him for a baby. You can find them in\r\nall sizes and can have a series to show the stages of growth. This is\r\none of the first steps in the making of a \"Life History Collection,\"\r\nfar more valuable to the naturalist than a collection containing only\r\nmature insects.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, all adult insects have wings, and all winged\r\ninsects are adults. There are exceptions to this, but they will take\r\ntheir places when the time comes. The young of the insects belonging to\r\ncertain orders resemble their parents enough so as to be placed where\r\nthey belong at a glance. This is true of the grasshoppers, katydids,\r\nand crickets, of the true bugs which include the squash-bugs, the\r\nchinch-bug, the stink-bug and others. Of most of the other orders\r\nthis is not true. The young do not look at all like the adults. In\r\nmany cases as, for example, the dragon fly and the mosquito, they\r\nare fitted in the immature stages to a life in the water. They must,\r\non this account, have organs for swimming, for aquatic breathing, and\r\nfor getting a living in the water. The forms of these young insects\r\nare just as varied as those of the adults, but they do not resemble\r\nthe winged ones in the least. The life history collection must contain\r\nspecimens of the immature forms of insect life as well as adults if it\r\nis to be most useful and complete.\r\n\r\nSome orders of insects, as for example the moths, butterflies, beetles,\r\nflies, bees, wasps, ants, and others pass through four distinct\r\nchanges of form. They always follow the same order. Every generation,\r\nbeginning with the egg, passes next to the larva (called caterpillar\r\nor incorrectly worm, or grub, or maggot), on to the pupa, then to the\r\nadult. The egg of an insect is often a most beautiful object. With a\r\nhand lens, which every collector will surely need, one can see its\r\ndelicate colouring, its pearl-like shell, its curiously carved or\r\nsculptured surface. To get some idea of the great variety in form,\r\ncolour, shape, and markings of insects' eggs, ask at your library for a\r\nbook on butterflies, with coloured plates, and the chances are that you\r\nwill be surprised.\r\n\r\nThe second or larval stage of the insect's life is the eating, growing\r\nstage. During this stage the young bee, butterfly, ant, or moth\r\nmoults several times. In this process the entire old skin is shed, an\r\noperation well worth seeing. Under the old coat a new one has formed,\r\nwhich being larger, accommodates itself to the insect's increased size.\r\nThe larval stage is in the case of many insects the active time when,\r\nif they are vegetable feeders, they injure crops.\r\n\r\nWhen the larva has completed its growth it changes into a pupa. Some\r\ninsects pass this third stage inside of silken cases they spin about\r\nthemselves, others, after shedding the larval skin, find themselves\r\neach clad in a sort of horny coat of mail. We call these chrysalides.\r\nSome larvæ creep away into the ground, there to shed their old coats\r\nand rest inside of the pupa cases which nature provides. Each one\r\nfollows the fashion of his own family and is in no danger of being\r\nmistaken for any one else.\r\n\r\nOut of the pupa, whether it be cocoon, chrysalis, or just plain pupa\r\ncase, comes the adult. The main business of adult insects is to\r\nreproduce their kind. After the eggs are laid there is little excuse\r\nfor their living. In the case of a great many kinds of insects death\r\nfollows soon after. There are some noted exceptions to this rule as\r\nfor instance the wasps which build with so much skill and patience\r\nthe homes in which to rear their young, the ants and the bees, both\r\nsocial and solitary, which carry on such a complicated home life. Of\r\nthese highly \"civilized\" insects only a word can be spoken here. From\r\nthe chapter on \"Bee-Keeping\" and from other books you may learn of the\r\nwonders they perform. We must return now to our life history collection.\r\n\r\nHow the subject opens as we add specimens of cocoons and pupa cases to\r\nthe collection! To get a complete series illustrating the life, let\r\nus say, of one of our common butterflies, the monarch or milk-weed\r\nbutterfly, you should visit the clusters of milk-weed along the\r\nroadside or anywhere, in the forenoon of a sunny July or August day. A\r\nfew butterflies are probably flitting about in rather casual fashion.\r\nWatch them light on the leaves, mark the leaf with your eye and hurry\r\nto the spot. Search well. The tiny speck of pale yellow may be a\r\ndrop of milk but if it stands up on the leaf it is likely to be a\r\nbutterfly's egg. Your lens will tell you. Having made sure of one you\r\nwill find others.\r\n\r\nYou may find a young caterpillar lunching on the leaf. If just out of\r\nthe egg it is a dull lead colour, but when half grown a young monarch\r\nis striped with rings of greenish yellow and black. Though handsome\r\nas to colour scheme, this caterpillar has manners unbecoming a plain\r\ncitizen, let alone a monarch. Touch its back with a grass stem and see\r\nwhat happens.\r\n\r\nIf time permits you should visit your clump of milk-weed daily or\r\nbetter still take home the eggs and the young caterpillars. Keep the\r\nfood plant fresh in a jar of water and get more when needed. As you\r\nwant a specimen of the egg-shell for your collection, you must be on\r\nthe spot when the young caterpillars come out. They sometimes eat the\r\nshell the first thing. It is a delicate operation to glue a thing as\r\nfrail as this shell onto a dried milk-weed leaf, and you may have\r\nto content yourself with making a sketch of it on a small square of\r\ndrawing paper. Pin the leaf or the drawing in the box. It is not easy\r\nto keep specimens of caterpillars. There is a method of preparing\r\nthe inflated skins, but as the process is a difficult as well as a\r\nghastly one, you can wait till you go to college to learn it. For the\r\nmilk-weed caterpillar I suggest instead, a coloured drawing. When your\r\ncaterpillars are full-sized they will transform into chrysalides.\r\nIt is worth sitting up all night to see a sight like this. When\r\na caterpillar spins a little mat of silk and suspends itself by a\r\ntail-hook, you will know that the performance is about to begin. The\r\nchrysalis is a lovely light green with spots of gold upon it. All this\r\nbeauty was hidden under the skin of the caterpillar. With an egg, a\r\ncaterpillar, a chrysalis, and an adult you have all four stages of the\r\nmonarch's life represented.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT HOMES\r\n\r\nNothing in the insect world interests me more than their homes. The\r\ncollector sees many of these in his rounds, and begins to consider\r\nhow he can complete his series by adding samples of them as specimens\r\nto his collection. I was lucky enough to find, when on a collecting\r\ntrip one day, a curious structure made of mud on a weed stem. It was\r\ndeclared by the professor to be an ants' \"cow-shed.\" Knowing that the\r\nmuseum specimen was in a bad state of repair I readily offered my find\r\nto replace it. The professor refused the gift, but offered me what he\r\nthought it was worth. I accepted and bought a pair of shoes with the\r\nmoney, which shows that these things have a market value.\r\n\r\nIt is well to press a specimen of the favourite food plant of a species\r\nof insect and make it a part of the collection. But dried butterflies,\r\nfastened in utterly unnatural attitudes upon dried plants they would\r\nscorn to eat in life, framed or put under glass globes on the parlour\r\ntable do not appeal to the naturalist. They are \"fakes\" pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThere will be a few among the many who begin to make collections of\r\nvarious kinds who will keep at it. I know one young man who sold his\r\nstamp collection for enough to take him on his first trip abroad. Six\r\nhundred dollars was the sum realized, I believe. Those of you who have\r\nread Mrs. Gene Stratton-Porter's story \"The Girl of the Limberlost\"\r\nremember that \"the girl\" sold Indian relics and insects enough to send\r\nherself to high school and start a college fund. She made up little\r\nlife history collections to illustrate the talks she gave as special\r\nteacher of nature study in the grades in a city school system.\r\n\r\nThe Limberlost girl had an offer of three hundred dollars for a\r\ncomplete collection of the butterflies and moths of the United States.\r\nShe had a wonderful collecting ground in and about the big swamp,\r\nand she had enough duplicates to exchange with other collectors for\r\nthings she could not get at home. In order to have perfect specimens,\r\nboth male and female, she made breeding cages and reared the moths\r\nand butterflies. She dug in the earth about the tree roots and other\r\n\"likely\" places for pupæ, she searched the shrubs and vines and trees\r\nfor hanging cocoons, she brought in innumerable eggs, caterpillars,\r\nand chrysalides and the story of her successes and failures fills many\r\ndelightful pages. It all rings so true that you can't help hoping that\r\nyou may see her insect collection some day, and hear her tell how\r\nshe brought this butterfly up \"by hand,\" how she had to wait a year\r\nto get a male to complete one series, how narrowly she escaped the\r\nquicksands in a wild chase she had for another, and other details of\r\nher occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nREARING INSECTS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bandbox breeding-cage for insects]\r\n\r\nBreeding insects is easy. Look at the home-made breeding-cage\r\nillustrated on this page. Materials needed: One round or oval hat box,\r\na strip of wire screen, two and a half feet wide or so and long enough\r\nto fit around the inside of the box and lap three inches. Either sew\r\nthe screen together in the form of a cylinder or fasten it every\r\nsix inches with paper fasteners. (Any way to keep it together good\r\nand tight.) Push the screen down inside the box till it touches the\r\nbottom, put the lid on and you are ready for business. If the screen\r\nis too wide you will have trouble in reaching to the bottom of the\r\nbox which you will have to do sometimes, for one reason or another.\r\nInto breeding-cages made on this general plan you can put all sorts of\r\nmaterial while waiting developments, and get many additions to your\r\ncollection that you would otherwise miss entirely.\r\n\r\nSome surprising facts are often discovered by accident. A breeding-cage\r\ncontaining a female _Cecropia_, one of our largest and most beautiful\r\nmoths, was accidentally left near an open window over night. The next\r\nmorning between twenty and thirty moths of that species were found\r\nfluttering about the cage. They had evidently been attracted from some\r\ndistance, but found their way to their imprisoned sister unerringly.\r\n\r\nCollectors have many ways of capturing night flying moths. One way\r\nis known as \"sugaring.\" This consists of daubing a sticky, sweet\r\npreparation on the trunks of trees and visiting the baits later in\r\nthe evening with cyanide jars and capturing the specimens which are\r\nattracted by the odour to the feast set for them. It is unsportsmanlike\r\nand entirely unnecessary to put any poisonous substance in the bait and\r\nthis practice should be darkly frowned upon.\r\n\r\nThe best places for sugaring are these: a strip of woodland edging a\r\nstream, the rim of the woods adjoining an open field or pasture, old\r\nroadways through woods of beech, oak, chestnut, or any mixed growth,\r\nwooded slopes in city parks where there is some protecting undergrowth,\r\nanywhere about the old groves surrounding country homes. Windy or wet\r\nnights are not the best for sugaring, neither are moonlight nights.\r\nThe ideal night for this is the evening after a hot, sticky day in\r\nlate summer, the sky overcast and dark but not foggy. You will need a\r\nlantern to work by. Keep calm. Quick, nervous movements frighten away\r\nmore moths than the light.\r\n\r\nThe following is the unspeakable concoction recommended by one\r\ncollector as \"the best ever\" for baiting moths:\r\n\r\nFour pounds darkest sugar.\r\n\r\nOne quart New Orleans molasses.\r\n\r\nOne pint stale beer or ale. (This should have been allowed to stand\r\nuncorked in a warm place for a week, before using it.)\r\n\r\nMix all together and heat gradually. Boil till about as thick as\r\nvarnish, which takes about five minutes. When cool add four ounces of\r\nJamaica rum. Cork loosely and keep in a cool place. The strong odour\r\nof this mixture pervades the air for a long distance, and proves\r\nattractive to the olfactories of moths though none of us would care to\r\nhave it about.\r\n\r\nA good evening's work at sugaring ought to furnish moths enough to\r\nkeep you busy spreading all the next forenoon. A night in the cyanide\r\njar will do them no injury. It is well to have a pair of light pincers\r\nto take specimens out with. If all are emptied out at once some will\r\ndry too much before you are ready to spread them. Every time they are\r\nhandled they lose part of the scales and become slightly defective. If\r\npractical, put the very large specimens into the jar hinder end first.\r\nThis will make it easier to get them out head first.\r\n\r\nIt is almost inevitable that the inveterate collector of insects shall\r\nbecome a naturalist. By constant watching, he discovers how insects\r\nlive, and how they affect plants. He will witness many a tragedy. He\r\nwill find that there are among them thieves and robbers, pirates,\r\ncannibals, assassins, scavengers, and disease carriers. He will witness\r\nmany acts of heroic self-denial, some feats of strength, endurance\r\ntests, and acrobatic turns. He will admire the ingenious architecture\r\nand wonder at the never ending variety of forms, colours, and markings\r\nthey exhibit. Many questions will come up in the course of his studies.\r\nHe may seek the books in vain for information on some of the commonest\r\ninsects of the garden. Entomology is a new science. Boys and girls who\r\nbegin the study by collecting their first insect to-day may, before\r\nthey stop, discover some important fact to add to the sum of human\r\nknowledge and make the world a better place to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nODD JOBS\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDLING WOOD\r\n\r\nCutting kindling wood was ever a boy's job. Most set tasks have little\r\nto them but drudgery. But cutting kindling used to be interesting. What\r\nis there about it? The struggle to master a stubborn stick, the danger\r\nthat a slip may bring the axe down elsewhere than on the stick, or that\r\na careless blow may cause the stick to rebound, leap into the air, and\r\ngive the chopper a whack on the head? Scarcely a boy but can show a\r\nhatchet's scar on the foot and I know a girl who will always carry one\r\nin the place where most people carry a corn.\r\n\r\nThe problem of a source of kindling supply on the farm is never one\r\nto be reckoned with. There are always old fences going to pieces, old\r\nbuildings being torn down, and the problem is rather how to store\r\nthe supply where it can be had when needed. In town things are\r\ndifferent. The fences, if any, are iron, the buildings are few and kept\r\nin repair because they cost so much to build. There are practically no\r\nloose boards lying around and kindling has to be bought outright. The\r\nex-farmer always resents this as an uncalled-for expense. But kindling\r\nis a necessity wherever fires are to be made. No patent article quite\r\nfills the bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Helen W. Cooke. An Odd Job That is Never\r\nOut of Date]\r\n\r\nWhy should grown men monopolize the kindling business? Because there is\r\ngood money in it? But any boy can go into this business, if he has any\r\nspunk. The capital required is very small. If your credit is good you\r\ncan borrow a hatchet. The chances are that spunk will supply the wood.\r\nIt may be rotting in somebody's wood lot waiting till the right boy\r\ncomes along.\r\n\r\nBoys in the South are lucky. They can get fat pine which is in great\r\ndemand both North and South. Some say the supply has given out, but who\r\nbelieves such tales? The demand for this will never be less than now\r\nand there is no substitute for fat pine.\r\n\r\nCollecting driftwood is another occupation for boys, sea-coast boys,\r\nthis time. A kind of substitute for this is being sold. It is a mixture\r\nof chemicals and does very well for toy fireplaces in city apartments.\r\nBut the real thing will always bring a fancy price.\r\n\r\nIt is the common practice of American lumbermen to regard no part of\r\nthe tree as valuable, but the trunk. All the rest is rubbish and the\r\nexpense of trimming off the branches reduces the amount of profit on\r\nevery log. Some day when our young foresters get enough experience to\r\nsee all round the great subject they are working at, they will think\r\nout ways of disposing economically of the tops and branches of the cut\r\ntrees. This is one of the big problems of forestry for these reasons:\r\n(1) The huge amount of this refuse wood chokes out the young growth and\r\nthe forest cannot renew itself as it would naturally. (2) The brush\r\ndries quickly and whenever a small fire gets started there is fresh\r\nfood for it everywhere. (3) The brush prevents the fighters from making\r\ntheir way to the threatened district. They have to fight the brush\r\npiles before they get to the fire.\r\n\r\nThis refuse wood might be put to a number of uses, e. g., for pulp\r\nwood, thus saving the trunks for lumber; for fuel, nothing makes better\r\nfires than the smaller limbs; for kindling, the branches which are too\r\nsmall to use for stove wood make splendid kindling, particularly for\r\nfireplaces.\r\n\r\nSome of us think gathering faggots too slow and laborious. But we\r\nneedn't make work of it. When I see men, women and children poking over\r\nthe masses of evil-smelling rubbish on the mammoth dump-heaps that\r\ndeface the landscape near some of our great cities, or going from house\r\nto house collecting old iron or rubber or newspapers, or picking over\r\nthe slag along the railways for chance lumps of coal, I wish that there\r\nwere some way of getting them away into the woods where firewood is\r\nrotting and doing harm besides, a waste that works both ways, you see.\r\n\r\nThere is no excuse for the poor people of a village near woods\r\nsuffering for fuel. They needn't steal. Let them get permission from\r\nthe owner to clean up his wood lot. It will be good for the wood lot\r\nand the owner knows it if he is an intelligent man. The boys and girls\r\nare much safer gathering faggots in the woods than coal along the\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\nFaggots for kindlings bring a fair price, too, and I recommend it as\r\na way of earning money out of your father's wood lot if he has one.\r\nIn some villages in Germany the people have the right to break off in\r\nthe forest all the branches that they can reach when standing on the\r\nground. In those forests there is never any loss of life, nor lumber,\r\nby fires, no choking out of young growth by brush piles. You could walk\r\nthrough the forest there and see in every direction miles and miles of\r\nclean trunked trees of varying ages, but no underbrush, no rubbish, no\r\ndecaying logs, no diseased wood.\r\n\r\nMaybe those thrifty German people made mistakes when their country was\r\nas young as ours. But they found out the way to take care of their\r\nforests hundreds of years ago and we can learn how from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANING A CARRIAGE\r\n\r\nIf you get home late at night after a drive in the mud the chances are\r\nthat you will not clean the carriage till the next day. But if thin mud\r\nis allowed to dry on a varnished surface it will be sure to leave spots.\r\n\r\nWater is the \"first aid to the injured\" in cleaning highly polished\r\nvehicles. Plenty of it should be flushed onto the varnish, the mud\r\nwashed off by the force of the water rather than being rubbed off or\r\nscraped off. Keep your buggy out of the bright sunlight when not in\r\nuse, especially when it is wet. Slow drying is better for the varnish.\r\n\r\nA coarse sponge is a good thing to wash a carriage with; this should be\r\nthoroughly rinsed after each rub to free it from grit. Never use soap\r\non varnish. It may be used on the metal parts of the carriage. Prepared\r\nchalk is the best for polishing the ornamental parts. For glass, clean\r\nwater and a cloth or chamois skin are all you need.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK IN THE ORCHARD\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shield-budding]\r\n\r\nMany are the light jobs in the orchard or fruit plantation, which fall\r\nto the boys. I know a boy who at thirteen was his father's expert\r\nbudder. There are high school boys in localities where nurseries and\r\norchards are plentiful who follow this as a trade, making good wages\r\nat it. It is a wonderful thing to do, a very neat job in handicraft,\r\nand while a book might tell how it is done, nobody could learn how to\r\nbud or graft without seeing it done and then trying, till the trick\r\nis learned. Boys also follow the grafter and tie in the bud or wax the\r\ngraft.\r\n\r\nBoys are often employed in vineyards to follow the pruners and tie the\r\nvines to the trellis or wire with rags or raffia. They become very\r\nexpert and tie an incredible number in a day. In fact many of the light\r\njobs grow pretty heavy after eight or nine hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING RUSTIC FURNITURE\r\n\r\nCollecting material for making rustic furniture is a pastime that is\r\nsuggested by walks in the woods. Sometimes a bit of twisted branch may\r\nlook like the arm of a settee or the leg of a tea-table. Procuring the\r\nfirst part suggests the quest for the other pieces and the fitting them\r\ntogether to make a natural looking, balanced, artistic piece. Rustic\r\nfurniture to be good, should appear to have grown that way. There is\r\ntoo much of the kind that looks as if it were made to sell. The truth\r\nis that the more truly artistic it is the better price it will bring\r\nin the right market. Laurel wood is particularly adapted for rustic\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING SEED CORN\r\n\r\nBy a careful study of what experts have to say about the best corn for\r\nseed, and of the photographs of ears of prize corn, any young man\r\nof intelligence may learn to select from his father's field the best\r\ncorn for seed. It may be that your father buys his seed corn from a\r\nseedsman. My experience is that seed corn bought in bulk contains a\r\nlarge number of poor grains. They probably shell the whole ear. The\r\nbest farmers never plant grains from tips or butts of ears, since it\r\ncosts just as much to plant and cultivate and harvest a runty corn\r\nstalk bearing a nubbin as it does a lusty, towering stalk with two good\r\nears of corn on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prize seed corn]\r\n\r\nFind out what a good ear of corn looks like. Make note of all the\r\npoints to be encouraged. The habit of producing two good ears of corn\r\nis a good one to establish. Go through the field when the corn is ripe,\r\nbefore the huskers, and select the best ears, with all the points you\r\nhave learned in mind. Take off the outer husks and draw the rest back,\r\nexposing the entire ear. When you have ten or a dozen ears braid the\r\nhusks together, starting with three ears, adding one after another to\r\nthe braid till all are secure. Fasten with strong twine and make a loop\r\nto hang the bunch by. Seed corn should hang for a few weeks in the open\r\nto cure, but should be taken inside before snow. You will have to use\r\na good deal of ingenuity to keep chickens, rats, squirrels, and other\r\nthieves away from your seed corn.\r\n\r\nWhen spring comes the corn should be shelled, and every imperfect grain\r\nshould be discarded. By selecting the seed in this way, demanding of\r\neach ear that it shall be perfect, you find the crop will improve, if\r\ncultivation is good, the soil well enriched, and the season normal.\r\nEvery time a farmer boy uses his mind first in connection with any kind\r\nof work, the quality of work improves and his interest in his work\r\nincreases. Selecting seed not only gives better corn but it helps make\r\na better farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING CIDER VINEGAR\r\n\r\nEvery good apple year there are thousands of bushels of apples that go\r\nto waste. It doesn't pay to pick and put them into barrels when the\r\nprice of barrels is more than you can get for the apples. The farmer is\r\nthe last man to learn how to make use of what ordinarily goes to waste.\r\nNature is lavish always, but wastes nothing. The farmer has learned\r\nto be lavish and wasteful too. They say that every part of the pig is\r\nutilized in the packing house except the squeal. That is the principle\r\nwhich the farmer will have to live by if he would succeed. What can be\r\ndone with those wasting apples? Let the boys have them to make into\r\npure cider vinegar. Every one knows how vinegar has been adulterated,\r\nand now the law-makers have put their veto on the practice and a\r\npenalty to match the crime.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very difficult about the physical part of vinegar\r\nmaking. Nature does the hard work but we can aid nature by providing\r\nthe ideal conditions for making the product we want.\r\n\r\nThe best apples for making pure cider vinegar are clean, ripe apples.\r\nIf you use green, dirty, decayed, or over-ripe apples, your vinegar\r\nwill probably not meet the lawful tests and your time and work will be\r\nwasted. Green apples have not enough sugar in them. The same is true of\r\nover-ripe apples. \"But there isn't much sugar in cider vinegar,\" you\r\nsay. No, that is true, but without sugar in the cider you wouldn't get\r\nany vinegar. If you were a chemist you could find out just how much\r\nsugar was contained in the juice of your apples. Unless the cider has\r\n85 per cent. of sugar it will not make vinegar good enough to satisfy\r\nthe requirements of the law. However, plenty is found in cider made\r\nfrom sound, ripe apples, and he who makes cider out of anything else\r\ndeserves to fail.\r\n\r\nExpose any fruit juice to the air and it will change. We say, \"Oh, that\r\nis fermented,\" and throw it away. But what is this ferment? Set a glass\r\nof fresh apple juice in the sun and watch it. In a few days you can\r\nactually see that some change is taking place. It is \"working,\" as they\r\nsay. The sugar is changing to alcohol; so the chemists tell us. What\r\nmakes it do this? The chemists must answer again. They say that there\r\nare yeast plants in the apple juice. How did they get there? We did not\r\nput yeast in the apple juice. No, but the air is full of the spores\r\nof wild yeast plants so the juice does not have to wait till we put\r\nin domesticated yeast from a little \"silver\" wrapper. As these yeast\r\nplants grow they cause the sugar in the juice to change to alcohol.\r\nThere are lots of other wild spores in the air and in the dirt which\r\ncollects on the apples if they are left out very long. Some of these\r\nspores may be of a kind that would delay the fermentation. For this, if\r\nfor no better reason, we should wash our cider apples.\r\n\r\nIn a glass of cider set out in the sun it does not take long for the\r\nyeast plants to convert all the sugar to alcohol, because warmth\r\nhastens the work. In the barrel set in a cool cellar it takes longer,\r\nabout six months.\r\n\r\nBut you have no vinegar yet. You have nothing but \"hard\" cider which\r\nisn't fit for anything. But in the barrel along with the yeast plants\r\nare lots of other bacteria, to be seen under the microscope. Among them\r\nis a kind that causes alcohol to change to acetic acid. Did you ever\r\npour off the vinegar from a jug and find a mass of jelly-like substance\r\nstopping the mouth of the jug? They called it \"mother\" didn't they?\r\nThis mother contains great numbers of acetic acid makers and if placed\r\nin your barrels will hasten the changes that fit the hard cider for use\r\non the table.\r\n\r\nThe making of cider vinegar is almost all profit for there is very\r\nlittle outlay for materials and very little work is required. It\r\ndoes take some knowledge of what to do and when. A little study and\r\nexperience makes success almost certain. A bulletin of the New York\r\nState Experiment Station at Geneva gives the following directions,\r\nsomewhat abbreviated here, for making good cider vinegar at home:\r\n\r\n\"Use sound ripe apples, picked before they have become dirty or\r\ncrushed. Observe ordinary precautions to secure cleanliness in grinding\r\nand pressing, and use no water. Let the juice stand a few days to\r\nsettle, then draw off the clear liquid into barrels that have been\r\ncleansed and treated with steam or boiling water. Do not fill more than\r\nthree fourths full. Put a loose plug of cotton into the bung hole.\r\nIf kept at a temperature of fifty to forty-five degrees Fahr. the\r\nalcoholic fermentation will be complete in about six months. This time\r\ncan be shortened to three months by keeping a temperature of sixty-five\r\nto seventy degrees in the storage room and by adding one cake of\r\nFleischmann's compressed yeast dissolved in a little water, to every\r\nfive gallons of juice. When the cider stops 'working' you will know\r\nthat the sugar has all been changed to alcohol. The clear liquid should\r\nnow be drawn off, the barrels rinsed and filled again. To each barrel\r\nshould now be added from two to four quarts of good vinegar containing\r\nsome 'mother.' If kept at a temperature of sixty-five to seventy\r\ndegrees Fahr. the vinegar may be ready for use in six months. If kept\r\nvery cool it may be two years. When sour enough to be 'just right' the\r\nbarrels should be filled as full as possible and tightly corked or the\r\nsourness may disappear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING GRAPE JUICE\r\n\r\nAny girl with a little experience in canning fruit can make for home\r\nuse and for sale a harmless and delectable beverage out of the surplus\r\ngrapes. Every good grape year on the farm there comes the question of\r\nwhat to do with the grapes. A little jelly is made when the grapes are\r\ngreen but most people prefer currant jelly or blackberry or crab apple.\r\nCanned grapes are pronounced \"no good\" by all the family, and grape\r\nmarmalade is full of \"splinters of glass,\" though how they got there\r\nwho can say?\r\n\r\nThe housekeeping magazines give receipts for preserving grapes but\r\ncold storage alone gives good results and few farms have cold storage\r\nplants. Those grapes hang there by the bushel and try as you may you do\r\nnot get them all eaten fresh.\r\n\r\nGrape juice is not wine. If you should try to make wine you would\r\nprobably fail. But unfermented grape juice is easier to make than jelly\r\nand as it needs no sugar your investment is small. Grape juice has food\r\nvalue, as it contains more solid matter than milk, and is recommended\r\nas a drink for children and for invalids. In many European countries\r\n\"grape cures\" have long been popular. In the pure, unadulterated,\r\nunfermented juice of the grape we have a palatable, nourishing food and\r\na refreshing drink in one. It is highly recommended as a preventive\r\nof some diseases, a cure for others, and as a restorative of general\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nSo much for the product. Now how is it made? It is possible to make\r\ngrape juice from start to finish in the open air. If the grapes grow\r\non an arbour what more delightful occupation can you imagine than\r\nspending a day or two converting the perfect fruit into nectar? Idling\r\nin a hammock may appeal to some, but a row of shining fruit jars worth\r\nseventy-five cents apiece looks better to an enterprising girl than a\r\nfinished novel.\r\n\r\nYou will need a table, a rocking chair, a large basket and scissors,\r\ngranite pans and double boiler, an oil or gasolene stove, clean jelly\r\nbag and flannel filter, jars or bottles, corks, rubbers, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the grapes are just right to eat out of hand they are right for\r\ngrape juice. Green or over-ripe grapes are not worth working over.\r\nDiscard all unsound fruit, wash, and crush. Put into a freshly washed\r\nbag of coarse, strong muslin, tie securely and twist and squeeze it\r\nuntil the juice is all out. Two people can work to advantage at this\r\njob.\r\n\r\nThe juice should now be put into a stone jar set in a pan of water or\r\nheated in a double boiler. It is just at this point that most people\r\nmake a mistake and destroy the fine flavour of the grape by boiling the\r\njuice. _It should never boil._ If you have a thermometer use it now.\r\nThe object of heating this juice is to destroy the yeast spores and\r\nother organisms which have alighted on the grapes as they hung in the\r\narbour and which are so small that they came right through the mesh\r\nof the muslin bag. A temperature of one hundred and eighty degrees to\r\ntwo hundred degrees Fahr. is high enough. Take the juice from the fire\r\nwhen the two hundred Fahr. is reached. A thermometer is not absolutely\r\nnecessary. When the juice begins to steam it is getting close up to two\r\nhundred and twelve degrees Fahr., the boiling point, which you must\r\navoid.\r\n\r\nMaking prime quality unfermented grape juice requires two forenoons.\r\nIf you want your jars to be clear from top to bottom instead of\r\nmuddy with sediment you will set the juice away in an enamelled or\r\nglass vessel until morning, when you will see why this precaution is\r\nnecessary. With greatest care dip the clear liquid off and filter\r\nit. A flannel bag made in the shape of a cone with a stiff wire or\r\nwooden ring at the top to hold it open, is the best filter. Several\r\nthicknesses of flannel or felt are better than one. All the tiny\r\nparticles of sediment will be caught in the woollen meshes and the\r\njuice will be pure. The last traces of settlings, will be removed and\r\nthe liquid will be clear. The colour and flavour will depend on the\r\nkind of grape used.\r\n\r\nPut the filtered juice into bottles or fruit jars that have been\r\nsterilized by boiling in water. Do not fill them quite full. Wiping\r\nis unnecessary. Fit a false bottom made of a thin board or slats into\r\nthe bottom of the washboiler and set the jars of grape juice with\r\nrubbers and covers on but not screwed down in on this. Put water into\r\nthe boiler till it comes up to the shoulders of the jars. Heat now\r\nuntil the water is on the point of boiling, but do not let it boil.\r\nRemove jars from the water and screw down the covers. If bottles are\r\nused, clean, sterilized corks must be put in, while the juice is still\r\nin the hot water. If the corks are very tight further sealing is not\r\nrequired, but wax or paraffine is put over them by cautious persons to\r\nmake assurance doubly sure.\r\n\r\nQuart jars are probably most economical and will find a ready sale.\r\nGrape juice will ferment very soon after unsealing and should be used\r\nimmediately. Even a small family will have no difficulty in consuming\r\na quart if given the opportunity. Many delicious desserts can be made\r\nwith this juice combined with sugar, eggs, gelatine, cream, lemons, and\r\nother fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING LEAF MOULD\r\n\r\nEvery year I see boys and girls raking leaves from the lawns and\r\neither piling them in the street or in the back yard and then burning\r\nthem. Nobody likes an outdoor fire more than I do, whether it is a\r\nreal camp fire, a little back yard faggot fire just enough to roast\r\na few potatoes and onions and play gypsy, or a big blazing bonfire,\r\nalmost dangerous and wholly splendid. What I don't like is a sickly,\r\nsmouldering pile of leaves sending out a suffocating smudge, bursting\r\nwith sudden flame at night and having to be put out after you had your\r\nslippers on and had begun a new book. Such a fire is a nuisance to you\r\nand to the neighbourhood and no satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBurning leaves is like burning money. That is quite another way of\r\nlooking at it. \"Why, most people have to pay out money to get their\r\nleaves taken away,\" you say. True, but that is because we are such\r\na lot of wasters. We are just beginning to learn to be economical,\r\nbecause we must. To make a long story short, turn your leaves into\r\nmoney by composting them.\r\n\r\nFor greenhouse work pure leaf mould is a necessity and the supply of\r\nthe real article is never equal to the demand. Ask the florist in your\r\ntown where he gets leaf mould and how much it costs him.\r\n\r\nMaking leaf mould is simple. All you have to do is to rake the leaves\r\ninto a pile where they can lie still and rot. To make a really neat\r\njob and lose none of your work or leaves make a frame of boards a foot\r\nhigh or so and as large as you think your leaves will require. Set this\r\nframe in some part of the yard where it will not look unsightly but\r\nas near the source of leaf supply as is permissible. If you have to\r\ncarry the leaves by wheelbarrow you will see the force of this. Use a\r\npony and cart for the job if you have them. A big box or barrel on a\r\nwheelbarrow is better than the wheelbarrow alone. Get a layer of leaves\r\na foot deep, then tramp it. If water is handy, wetting them with a few\r\npailfuls would make them pack well. Put on layer after layer of leaves\r\nif pure leaf mould is to be made.\r\n\r\nLay boards over the top to hold the leaves down or the autumn winds\r\nwill scatter them for you. Forking over a few times will hasten the\r\nprocess of decay. A very small quantity of leaf mould for home use can\r\nbe made in a store box or barrel. This should not be water tight. Let\r\nthe leaves be exposed to all the elements; the rain, the air, freezing\r\nand thawing, help on the process of decay.\r\n\r\nLeaves are a very valuable ingredient in the making of compost for the\r\ngarden. I have from an expert gardener this receipt for his favourite\r\n\r\n                          \"GARDEN FRUIT CAKE\"\r\n\r\n    Three parts selected leaves.\r\n    Three parts cow manure.\r\n    Two parts garden soil.\r\n    One part kitchen refuse and weeds.\r\n    One part pasture sod.\r\n\r\nCompost these in alternating layers for one, two, or three years under\r\ncover. The result is a rich, brown, moist compound which, added to\r\ncommon garden soil at suitable times, is warranted to raise flowers and\r\nvegetables fit for the queen's table.\r\n\r\nNow then, instead of burning your leaves, go out and gather all you can\r\nfrom the neighbour's yard as well as your own and make leaf mould.\r\nCombine the boys on the street into a \"Leaf Mould Syndicate\" and get\r\nthe local florists interested in a home-made product.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING LAVENDER STICKS\r\n\r\nThe weaving of lavender sticks has been described to me as \"the\r\nharmless occupation of old-fashioned fingers.\" In these days when the\r\nrevival of old-time industries is so often undertaken, it is well to\r\nlearn from our aunts or our great-aunts some of the fancy work that\r\nemployed their elegant leisure when they were girls. The lavender\r\nstick is such a sweet and dainty object that I hope for it a renewed\r\npopularity. It is one of the always acceptable gifts the Pacific coast\r\ncan send to the Atlantic where it is so hard to make lavender grow.\r\nI might say here that there is good reason to advise the growing of\r\nlavender in the light limestone soil of some of our Southern states.\r\nImmense quantities are used in the manufacture of lavender water and\r\nperfumery, and although the dried flowers are retailed as a preventive\r\nfor clothes moths, I have grave doubts about that.\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn how to make lavender sticks is to have some dear\r\nold lady show you. Failing this you may try to follow these directions\r\nand the picture that goes with them. Late June is the best time,\r\nSeptember the next best. The lavender must be in full flower. If too\r\nyoung the stems will cure limp. The finest odour passes with the going\r\nto seed. Cut the flower stalks in clear weather and before the heat of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A lavender stick]\r\n\r\nAs some lavender sticks should be shorter and some longer to suit their\r\nvarious purposes, you should next sort the stalks into groups according\r\nto length. For a handkerchief box nine short ones would be right. To\r\nmake a large \"stick\" for a linen closet shelf choose twenty-five of\r\nthe longest, heaviest heads. Always have an odd number. Strip off the\r\nleaves, draw the stems down till the heads are all on a level, then tie\r\nthem \"gently but firmly, under their chins\" with soft cotton yarn that\r\nwill hold but not cut. Use plenty of string and leave very long ends.\r\nBuild the thistle-like head into a shapely oval--but not with cotton,\r\nafter the way of the Philistines. Plump it out with a little sheaf\r\nmade of the heads that are too small to use, and add a few leaves to\r\nround it out. With those long string ends wind the head, now, and tie\r\nsecurely.\r\n\r\nThe next step is one where skill and care are necessary. Each stem\r\nis to be bent directly backward at a sharp angle and it will be a\r\nwonder if you do not break every other one. Crease each stem over your\r\nthumb-nail before turning it back over the head. When all are safely\r\nreversed, double one end of a bolt of lavender ribbon over one stalk,\r\nclose to the top and begin to weave. The simplest weaving is the most\r\nartistic, under one stalk and over the next, passing round and round\r\ntill the head is covered. At this point it is best to fasten the end of\r\nthe ribbon, wind the stems with common string and begin on another till\r\nyou have brought all to the same stage. Lay them all away for a month\r\nto cure. You will find that the weaving will then have to be tightened\r\nabout the head. Now wind the ribbon tightly round the handle and fasten\r\nit there. A tuft of loops at the end is a simple and old-timey finish.\r\nThe less attempt at decoration the better. A lavender stick is a very\r\nacceptable gift for one who is fond of its perfume and can detect the\r\naroma of homely sentiment that mingles with its sweetness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRYING CORN\r\n\r\nIn my girlhood the surplus sweet corn was not left to dry on the\r\nstalks. It does not make very good fodder. The best ears were marked\r\nand left to ripen for seed, but the surplus green corn was dried. The\r\nboys would bring in a bushel or so of ears in the husk. We prepared\r\nthese as carefully as if for immediate use on the table. Every silk was\r\nremoved. The ears were then put into boiling water a few at a time and\r\nleft only five or six minutes, just long enough to \"set\" the milk. As\r\nsoon as the corn had cooled sufficiently we began to cut it off, with\r\nthin, sharp knives. With the butt of the ear resting on the flattest\r\nbig platter, one sliced from top to bottom. We had orders not to cut\r\ndeep the first time--just to take off the tops of the grains. The next\r\ncut was thin, too, and came off in a slice which fell apart. We cut\r\nthree slices, at least, before we came to the cob. By this means we\r\nobtained a final product far superior to that of the neighbours who\r\nmade one cut suffice. When a platter was full, the corn was spread\r\nevenly and put out in the sun, on a long table and covered with netting\r\nto keep off flies. When partially dry we transferred it to a large\r\ncloth and continued the drying until every vestige of moisture was\r\ngone from it. It was then put into a loose muslin bag and hung up\r\nnear the ceiling where mice and dampness could not get at it. I have\r\neaten evaporated corn, and find it a poor substitute for the sun-dried\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nTo prepare dried corn for the table wash well, soak over night, and\r\nthen steam slowly on the back of the kitchen stove from morning till\r\nlate afternoon, with salt to taste. By this time most of the water will\r\nhave been absorbed or evaporated. The corn will be soft and all its\r\nnative sweetness will be right there. Add a generous libation of cream,\r\na lump of butter, a whisk of pepper, and you have a delectable dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING A TENNIS COURT\r\n\r\nThe largest item in all the estimates for making a tennis court is\r\nfor labour. If a boys' club can supply this they can have a court\r\nwithout expense except for the wire netting and the necessary posts.\r\nA standard double court is seventy-eight feet by thirty-six. Choose a\r\nwell-drained piece of ground; the more nearly level the better. Locate\r\nthe courts with reference to the time of day when they will be most\r\nused and the direction of the sun's beams at that hour.\r\n\r\nThe first job is to get rid of the grass and weeds, root and branch. If\r\na plough is used do not begin the levelling until every root is gone.\r\nTurning grass under is bad practice. Some kinds of grass can grow no\r\nmatter which end is up. Next with rakes make the surface fairly level.\r\n_Level_ is one of those adjectives that can not be compared. If a court\r\nis level it can't be any leveller, and to be right it must be done with\r\na straight edge and a spirit level. If there is one boy in whom you all\r\nhave confidence, it is a good plan to elect him boss of the job and\r\nfollow his instructions. \"Team work\" is the right thing in this kind of\r\na job, just as in games. When the court is level it must be rolled and\r\nrolled and rolled again, with the heaviest roller you can get.\r\n\r\nA surface of ordinary dirt does not wear well. Some people prefer to\r\nspread on a layer of ashes, next three inches of sand, soil, and clay\r\nmixed.\r\n\r\nRoll each layer thoroughly. For a top finish a very fine gravel is used\r\non some courts, sand is used on others. You will probably use that\r\nwhich is most available. Clay is hard to work with, but when overlaid\r\nwith fine sand makes a hard court on which the swiftest experts can\r\nplay with enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe care of the court should be taken week about, two boys working\r\ntogether. The roller should be used often, especially after a rain, and\r\nworn spots mended immediately before they get bigger.\r\n\r\nMost clubs count in an expensive marker when estimating the cost of\r\ntennis. An ingenious boy can make one for nothing. A square varnish\r\ntin or olive oil can holding a gallon or more can easily be held by a\r\nframework upon a wheelbarrow or wheel hoe in such a way that the drip\r\nfrom two nail holes will fall upon the broad rim of the wheel. Fold\r\na piece of paper into funnel shape, fill the can with thin whitewash\r\nand paint mixed and you are as well equipped as if you had spent five\r\ndollars for a marker.\r\n\r\nIf conditions favour a grass court the sod should be taken off and the\r\nground beneath spaded, raked, and made level. Then the sod should be\r\nmatched and laid accurately, then rolled, sprinkled, and rolled again;\r\nfor three days at least the rolling and sprinkling should be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOVELLING SNOW\r\n\r\nThe boys of our neighbourhood made an abundance of pocket-money in the\r\nwinter time by combining into a \"Snow Shovellers Union.\" Most of the\r\nmen on our street take early trains and have very little time, and even\r\nless inclination to shovel snow. The boys are out early before the snow\r\ngets packed on the sidewalks. They work by the job or by the hour,\r\nwhichever the employer prefers.\r\n\r\nAt first the boys expected the employers to furnish the tools. But that\r\ndidn't work very well. To make work a pleasure one must have his tools\r\nright and an expert snow shoveller does not want to use a dilapidated\r\nspade on one job, a short-handled shovel here, and a long-handled one\r\nthere. He wants snow shovelling tools and after a little experience he\r\nknows what he wants.\r\n\r\nThe tools can be made by the boys. Our boys made a most efficient\r\nplough for walks, out of cheap store boxes, and a scraper for steps\r\nthat fit every corner accurately so that one scrape did the trick and\r\nno false motions to waste time and strength. For informal paths to\r\nchicken house, garden, etc., a shovel made of light barrel staves\r\nsawed in halves was found to be better than an expensive iron-bound\r\nshovel from the department store.\r\n\r\nIf there is a lame boy on your street take him into the Union too;\r\nalthough he can't keep up with you at the shovel, he can have a book,\r\nkeep track of the time each boy can work, call at patrons' doors to\r\narrange about their work, and these things are just as important as the\r\nactual shovelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOWING LAWNS\r\n\r\nIn summer the Snow Shovellers Union can reform into the \"Lawn Mowers\r\nand Irrigators, Limited.\" Every year I used to send my lawn mower\r\nto a \"tinker\" who charged me one dollar and twenty-five cents for\r\n_sharpening_ it. I learned one day and it made me sad, that a lawn\r\nmower properly cared for keeps itself sharp. Any boy who is strong\r\nenough to run a lawn mower ought to be smart enough to take care of\r\none. He needs to know how the machine is put together, what parts do\r\nthe work and where the wear comes on the parts. The directions which\r\ncome with a good machine are worth reading. The man who sells the mower\r\nmay not be able to explain any part you don't understand. His business\r\nmay be to sell, only. If you go into the hardware store and find the\r\nman who knows all about lawn mowers, he will be only too glad to show\r\nyou how to run the machine so that it will do its work and last. It\r\nis to his interest to have you recommend his machine. Make yourself\r\nfamiliar with a machine in perfect working order. Your ears and your\r\neyes ought to tell you when it is going wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is, above all, of greatest importance to know how to adjust a lawn\r\nmower. A wrench, a screw-driver, and an oil can should be your constant\r\ncompanions. Go over the machine before you begin and put it in shape.\r\nIt is ten minutes well spent. Tighten screws, oil the parts that rub,\r\nadjust the knife to the kind and condition of the grass. When the job\r\nis done, look the mower over. If a screw is lost be sure to supply a\r\nnew one before the next using; clean the machine and put it away in a\r\ndry place.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILIZING WOOD ASHES\r\n\r\nBoys who have as part of their daily work the cleaning out of ashes\r\nwould do well to stop and consider before they dump their pails. Coal\r\nashes are as nearly worthless as anything I know of although they can\r\nbe used in making a tennis court, and are even advised by some for a\r\nvery stiff garden soil. A garden must be pretty bad off to be improved\r\nby coal ashes.\r\n\r\nBut there are thousands of cords of wood burned every year and wood\r\nashes are very valuable. There is no fertilizer equal to them for\r\ncertain purposes. Not only are they valuable at home, but they are an\r\narticle of commerce, and have a market value. Who has a better right to\r\nthe ashes than the boy who manages the ash pan?\r\n\r\nBarrels are the most convenient receptacles to store ashes in. Cheap\r\nboxes come next. They should be tight and kept under cover. Leaching\r\ntakes the value out of wood ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING CROCUSES ON THE LAWN\r\n\r\nDid you ever see crocuses, yellow, lavender, and white, scattered\r\ninformally in the lawn, coming into blossom with the earliest springing\r\ngrass. One fall we tried the experiment of poking a crocus bulb down\r\nin the hole where we took out a dandelion and the result was charming.\r\nThere are philosophers who profess to a liking for dandelions in the\r\nlawn. Perhaps it is Hobson's choice with them, as with many, but\r\nalthough the dandelion flower is bright as gold the leaves are a real\r\nnuisance. They are coarse and rank and they resist the lawn-mower,\r\nand discourage the fine grasses. Except when in blossom they are a\r\ndisfiguring feature. Crocuses are certainly more delicate in flower\r\nthan dandelions and their leaves are more like grass. Moreover they\r\ndie down early and are out of the way of the lawn mower. So instead of\r\njust digging out a dandelion or a thistle and leaving a bare hole, I\r\nrecommend that you poke in a crocus bulb next fall. Your reward will\r\ncome in gold and purple.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING ICE\r\n\r\nLots of us get along without ice in winter because we cannot afford to\r\nbuy it all the year round. We put things outside and they freeze, we\r\nkeep them in the kitchen and they spoil. The butter is either too hard\r\nor too soft all the time.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls like ice-cream the year round and yet many of us do\r\nwithout it in the winter time because the iceman does not come around.\r\nSometimes you may have thought when you broke the ice in the watering\r\ntrough that there was nearly enough to make a freezer of ice-cream.\r\n\r\nDid it not occur to you that you could make home-made ice, supply the\r\nrefrigerator in coldest weather, and make ice-cream whenever you want\r\nit? All you need is the cold weather and a heavy tin pail. Fill the\r\npail with clean water some clear, cold night and stand it where it\r\nwill get the greatest exposure. If the mercury is a little below zero\r\nit will freeze a coat of ice two or more inches thick on top and sides\r\nof the pail. Turn the pail upside down on a bench and turn enough hot\r\nwater over it to loosen the pail; then take it off. The ice on the\r\nbottom will be thin. Break this and dip out all of the water, but about\r\ntwo inches. This will freeze very quickly in cold weather and you can\r\nput in more. Keep filling it up until your ice pail is solid. It is\r\nthen ready for the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nFrom making one block of ice in a heavy tin pail it is an easy step to\r\nmaking a winter supply to store in sawdust where the sun cannot melt it\r\nduring a thaw and where you can get at it when needed. From this the\r\nlogical conclusion is that a man and his boys could make a supply of\r\nice for both summer and winter by following the same tactics.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the hardships of the ice harvesters of my home\r\nneighbourhood. The ice had to be cut in the river three miles away, and\r\nhauled up a bad hill. If the roads were good the ice was bad as a rule.\r\nGood sleighing meant ice covered with snow. There was always anxiety\r\nfor fear we should not get a supply, and often the houses were filled\r\nwith thin cakes, for fear the cold weather was over for the year. Then\r\nthe hauling and the cutting in the bitter weather was bad for men and\r\nteams. The ice was river ice and we knew it was unsafe.\r\n\r\nA writer in _Country Life_ describes how he made his supply of\r\nhome-made ice. He first had a tinner make heavy tin boxes of a size\r\nconvenient to handle. He had them made an inch smaller at the bottom\r\nthan at the top and the top was bound over a heavy wire. When the cold\r\nweather came the clean pans were filled from the well. The cakes were\r\nturned out of the pans next day and dipped and filled just as described\r\nabove, as solid cakes formed. These were packed in the ice house for\r\nthe summer's supply as fast as made. The cost was less in time and\r\ncash, than putting up \"wild ice,\" even including the cost of pans,\r\nwhich can, of course, be used over and over, year after year.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING SEED POTATOES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: For cutting seed potatoes]\r\n\r\nCutting seed potatoes is a job that most boys and girls dislike and\r\nno wonder. It takes so long, is so dirty, your thumb gets so scored\r\nand even cut seriously. But most fathers want the potatoes cut before\r\nplanting and who is to do it but the boys and girls? Two ingenious\r\nboys invented a contraption which decreased the time and labour to a\r\nminimum and almost made the job a pleasure. This description of their\r\npotato cutter is adapted from _Farming_ for April, nineteen hundred and\r\nseven. A dry goods box holding several bushels was fitted with four\r\nstrong legs, just long enough to lift the box to a height convenient\r\nto sit by. At the bottom of one side of the box a board was removed to\r\nlet the potatoes roll out on a shelf attached beneath the opening. The\r\nshelf should have a rim two or three inches high and there should be a\r\ncrack where shelf and box come together to let the dust sift down. The\r\nknife is driven into the end of a short piece of plank and held with\r\nfence staples. The boy sits on the plank. The potato is pushed forward\r\nagainst the sharp blade and the pieces drop into the basket. A man can\r\ncut forty bushels of potatoes in a day with this outfit.\r\n\r\nThe work ought to be done out under a tree, and if the boys want to\r\nwear gloves to keep their hands clean and smooth for more delicate\r\nwork, I should encourage them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rosebush before pruning]\r\n\r\nWhen I see a lot of ignorant labourers put onto the job of pruning\r\ntrees, my blood fairly boils. Their work, unless overseen by an\r\nexpert, is pure butchery. Many a noble tree has been so mangled by saw\r\nand axe that it has become an easy prey to all sorts of diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rosebush after pruning]\r\n\r\nPruning is work that requires intelligence. In orchard and door yard\r\nany one with the strength to wield a saw or shears can do the annual\r\npruning. A woman can do it as I can testify, except occasionally\r\nwhere large limbs are to be handled. Such occasions seldom arise on\r\na well-cared-for place. It is impossible to treat the whole subject\r\nof pruning in one short chapter, but there is nothing difficult to\r\nunderstand about the principles or practice. In ten minutes an expert\r\ngrape pruner could show a pupil how to prune a grape-vine so as to\r\nproduce the best and largest crop. Each kind of shrub whether for fruit\r\nor flowers requires its special treatment. It takes experience to\r\nacquire judgment but the principles are easy to learn and to practise.\r\nYou should go to a book on pruning to learn just how to prune the\r\nvarious kinds of shrubs, vines, and trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The right way. The wound is healing]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The wrong way. The stub prevents healing]\r\n\r\nBut if there is a limb to be cut off a tree in the door yard who is\r\nlikely to be delegated to the job? Every boy ought to know how to do\r\nthis right. You may be acquainted with the boy who sat on the limb\r\nand sawed between the tree and himself, but you will certainly not\r\nshare his fate. When you use the pruning shears on the branches and\r\ntwigs of a tree or shrub you are, so to speak, cutting its fingernails\r\nor hair: but when you go up with a saw you are performing a far more\r\nserious operation. Do not forget that the life processes of the\r\ntree, the circulation of the blood, the assimilation of the food,\r\nthe respiration, all go on right under the bark. The \"heart\" of the\r\ntree is a misnomer. That fresh moist layer which is uncovered by\r\nthe skinning of a tree is the only part of the tree which is really\r\nactively alive and at work. This layer, called the cambium, extends\r\nlike a tight-fitting garment over the entire tree. Every tiny twig and\r\nspur is overlaid with it. If you ever had an \"infected\" finger from\r\na scratch or pin prick or cut you have some idea of the danger the\r\ntree is exposed to when the cambium layer is laid bare and the wound\r\nneglected. Compare the two drawings on this page. Look at the trees in\r\nyour yard. Are there some like No. 1 and others like No. 2? In No. 1\r\nthe pruner cut a branch off close up to the main trunk. The wound was\r\ndressed with thick paint to close the pores. All around the edge of\r\nthe wound was the cut edge of the cambium layer. A roll of new tissue\r\nformed there, covering a part of the wound the first year. In a year\r\nor two more the roll became broad enough to close over the smooth base\r\nwhere the severed limb was. The wound is healed. But look at the long\r\nstubs of No. 2. That was the work of a \"tree butcher.\" Already the stub\r\nhas begun to rot and the injury has gone far into the tree, past cure.\r\nYou have seen a fine board ruined by a knot hole? That knot hole was\r\nmade by careless pruning. Have you seen beautiful \"curly\" places in\r\nfine woodwork? Those curls or \"eyes\" are made by the healing over of\r\nplaces where limbs came off. As the cambium adds layer after layer over\r\nit, the base of the old limb becomes more and more deeply buried in the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nLearn the principles of pruning: cut off the branch, no matter how\r\nsmall, close to the trunk or larger branch from which it grew; cover\r\nthe wound with a dressing to prevent decay. Trees, shrubs, vines, and\r\nbushes should be pruned every year. Cut out all dead wood, and then\r\nprune to shape the tree or shrub as you want it or to produce the\r\ngreatest quantity of fruit, blossoms or branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANING RUGS\r\n\r\nThe sanitary home has never a carpet these days, but rugs on bare\r\nfloors. These rugs, if small enough to handle every week, make the\r\nsemi-annual old bugbear of house-cleaning a thing of the past. What\r\ncould be more dreary than to come home from school some afternoon and\r\nfind the floors littered with flattened old straw, so gray with dust as\r\nto be scarcely recognizable? Getting that straw out was the boys' work,\r\nthe girls did the sweeping and mother washed the floor. How cheerless\r\nthe days that followed! How damp the floors, how extra careful we had\r\nto be not to carry in dirt on our way to bed! The whole house wore\r\na dejected expression reflected by the family. All because of those\r\nmiserable carpets. They had to be beaten, too, and the clouds of dust\r\nthat had to be breathed before we heard the welcome call, \"That's\r\nenough now. Don't whip that carpet all to pieces. Fold it up and bring\r\nit in.\" As we folded it we realized how far from clean it really was\r\nand how we longed to _turn the hose on it_. But no one had the courage\r\nto suggest such an unorthodox proceeding. Probably the colour would all\r\nrun and the carpet would shrink and everything. But anyhow we wished it\r\nwas really clean, now that so much discomfort had been endured to clean\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRugs on bare floors are preferable. They can be swept and beaten every\r\nweek and they can be washed. No rug should be hung on a line to be\r\nbeaten. It is bad for the rug and a waste of energy. A rug-beating rack\r\ncan be made which will save the wear on the rugs and get them more\r\nnearly clean than any other dry method I know of. It is described, by\r\nMr. W. C. Egan, who devised it, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rug-beating frame up against the barn]\r\n\r\nMake a frame of four by four pine timbers, braced across the corners.\r\nIt should be somewhat bigger than the biggest rug you expect to beat.\r\nStretch galvanized iron fencing over this frame and staple it securely\r\nall round. The best place for this frame is at the side of the barn.\r\nStrong strap hinges should be used to attach it to a piece of four by\r\nfour spiked to the barn at a height convenient for your beating. When\r\nthe frame is not in use it is pushed up and rests against the side of\r\nthe barn, held in place by hooks. A rope and two pulleys enable one\r\nto raise and lower the frame easily. When down, the frame rests on\r\nswinging legs made of inch iron pipe and attached to the frame at the\r\nouter corners. The rug should be laid on the netting pile downward.\r\n\r\nRug-beating is hard work no matter what kind of tools one has. But who\r\ndoes not love to ply the hose? I made up my mind once that a rug that\r\nhad to have an expensive compressed air bath or stay dirty was not\r\nliving up to its function as a sanitary floor covering. I experimented\r\nwith an all-wool rug, some good white soap, warm rain water, and a\r\nscrubbing brush. A good lather was laid first on the back, then I threw\r\ndiscretion to the winds and lathered the face of the thing. I scrubbed\r\nit as if my life depended upon making the colours run, if they would.\r\nThen I let the children turn the hose on it. We turned it over and over\r\nand over again, till it was very, very wet. It was also clean. We left\r\nit on the grass in the shade the first day. Then we laid it still damp,\r\nface down, on the clean, dry floor of the porch where the sun could get\r\nat it and the breeze. It was dry by the night of the second day and so\r\nclean that it was a real joy to handle it. One by one we put every rug\r\nin the house through the same course of treatment. A couple of Wiltons,\r\na few of Brussels carpeting, some that were woven out of old ingrain\r\ncarpets, the rag ones, and finally the precious Orientals went through\r\nthe water cure. Before I dared do this last act, I got advice from a\r\nrug man, who said that really good rugs would suffer no harm from such\r\ntreatment. But one never believes until he tries it, and now we all\r\nbelieve, and our rugs are more beautiful than before. We treated the\r\nbest rugs very gently, of course, but none the less thoroughly, and we\r\ndried them face up on the hard floor right in the sun part of the time.\r\nIt takes about three days and nights to get the dampness all out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rug-beating frame, down in use]\r\n\r\nGood rugs ought never to be treated roughly. They should be swept\r\ngently _with the nap_, and never beaten with a whip, hung on the line,\r\nor shaken. Lay on a soft carpet of grass or on a rug-beating frame and\r\nbeat gently with a flat rattan beater. When rolled, roll with the nap;\r\nnever fold them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nMAKING THE COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE IN\r\n\r\n\r\nI once asked Professor Bailey, \"What is the most important farm crop\r\nraised in the United States?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation he answered, \"Boys and girls.\"\r\n\r\nOf course they are.\r\n\r\nThe best farmers, the real bone and sinew of the country, are the kind\r\nthat raise the crops themselves, without much help from the outside.\r\nThey grow nearly every thing they eat, and exchange their surplus for\r\nthe food and clothing that they can't raise. There is a type of farm\r\nlife where the family is brought up on the principle that what is too\r\npoor to sell is good enough to eat. The boys and girls of such a family\r\nare too good for such a life. They do not stay in the country. Like the\r\nbig apples, the prize potatoes, and the gilt-edge butter, though raised\r\non the farm, they are consumed in the city.\r\n\r\nThe country is the best place in the world for boys and girls to grow\r\nup in, just because it is the country. But there are ways in which\r\ncountry life can be improved and if the grown folks are too busy\r\nraising crops, the young folks must head the campaign which is to make\r\nthe country a better place to live in.\r\n\r\nSince this is a book on outdoor work we cannot consider ways of making\r\nthe life indoors more attractive, more comfortable, more convenient,\r\nand more sanitary, but concern ourselves with outdoor problems only.\r\n\r\nBoys and girls, stop and think. What can you do to make your own\r\nparticular corner of the country a better place for you and your\r\ncompanions to live in? When a crowd of boys meet together, what do they\r\ntalk about? Are they interested in local affairs or do they tell each\r\nother of the great things they expect to do when they get away? A wise\r\nold man once said, \"In a republic you ought to begin to train a child\r\nfor good citizenship on the day of its birth.\"\r\n\r\nAre you going to be a good citizen? Are you patriotic? Do you salute\r\nthe flag at school, and then go out and break the game laws? Train now\r\nfor citizenship. There is more patriotism in obeying the laws of your\r\nhome, your school, your town, and your state than there is in parading\r\nwith flags and band in the National Guards. Good citizenship begins at\r\nhome. How can you make your own home a more desirable place for your\r\nbrothers and sisters to live in? Take a look at the house. Is it plain\r\nand unadorned and uncomfortable? Are the surroundings bare and ugly?\r\nHave you had experience in building, painting, and planting? If you can\r\nhelp build a corn crib, you can make a porch over the front door or a\r\nsidewalk connecting the back door with the pump or the milk house. If\r\nyou can help paint the barn, why not the house? If you can plant trees\r\nin the orchard, why not shrubs in the door yard, and vines over the\r\nporch? Don't think you must have expensive pillars and fancy railings.\r\nThey will not look as well as rustic work or pillars of home-made\r\ncement. The vines will soon cover the porch with their greenery if\r\ngiven half a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTDOOR CLUBS\r\n\r\nHave you a boys' club in your neighbourhood? Or a girls' club? You used\r\nto have a literary society in school, and it failed? Why was that? The\r\nboys didn't take any interest in it.\r\n\r\nWhy not have a club that the boys will take an interest in and a club\r\nthat the girls will take an interest in? What kinds of clubs do boys\r\nlike? Athletic clubs where they wrestle, box, turn handsprings, have\r\njumping, skating, walking, and running matches, and play such games\r\nof skill and endurance as hare and hounds, pitching horseshoes, and\r\nbaseball. They like all sorts of clubs that get real things done, like\r\nraising prize corn or cotton or pigs or training colts or steers or\r\ndogs. Boys and girls like to compete for prizes. How boys or girls\r\nwill work to do something so much better than any other boy or girl in\r\nthe crowd that the judges will award the prize to them. It is hard in\r\ncontests like these to be able to walk up like a true sportsman and\r\ncongratulate the winner. But a boy can learn to do it; so can a girl.\r\nAll over the United States boys are banding together to raise better\r\ncorn, better cotton, better chickens, better fruit. North, west, east,\r\nand south, thousands of boys are raising corn. They test their seed,\r\nprepare the soil, plant, cultivate, and harvest the crop, weigh it,\r\ntake it to the exhibition where they compare it with other boys' crops,\r\nand see for themselves who has the best yield. One boy, a member of\r\nthe Winnebago County Farmer Boys' Experiment Club took first prize of\r\nfifteen dollars in gold for the best ten ears of corn. This club has\r\nabout eleven hundred members. There is a Winnebago County Girls' Home\r\nCulture Club with an equally large membership. These boys and girls are\r\ngrowing up to be good citizens right there in the country, where they\r\nwere born. They don't have to go to the city to find education or good\r\nmanners or a good time. The fathers and mothers, the school teachers,\r\nthe ministers, and the county superintendent of schools all work\r\ntogether in Winnebago County, Ill., and they can everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Helen W. Cooke. Is This Work or Play?]\r\n\r\nThe boys in your home school can form a Boys' Agricultural Club now.\r\nThe first thing you need is information about other clubs. Your club\r\nwill not be just like the others. It ought not to be. But if you know\r\nhow the others are managed it will help you to manage yours. Send to\r\nthe Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., and ask for Farmers'\r\nBulletin No. 385 on Boys' and Girls' Agricultural Clubs. On page\r\nfifteen of this bulletin are suggestions as to an invitation to be sent\r\nout for the first meeting. If your teacher is willing you can hold\r\nthe first meeting some Friday afternoon in the early spring at the\r\nschool-house. If the teacher is not yet interested hold the meeting at\r\nsome home in the neighbourhood. If you are acquainted with the county\r\nsuperintendent or the school commissioner, tell him about the club you\r\nwant to start, and maybe he will arrange for the first meeting and get\r\nall the boys and girls in the county organized. You could have a local\r\nchapter of the club, with local exhibits and local prizes; then you\r\ncould have a space at the county fair, and members of different clubs\r\nall over the county could compete for first prize.\r\n\r\nThe bulletin gives suggestions for a constitution, enrollment of\r\nmembers, and a scheme for cards on which to keep a record of the crop\r\nyou are going to grow. There are rules, too, that each person who\r\ncompetes for prizes must observe.\r\n\r\nA good many boys' clubs start in with growing a crop of corn, and\r\ngirls' clubs with bread-making. They need not do these same things\r\nevery year, although one can learn something new about growing corn,\r\nraising chickens, or making bread every year.\r\n\r\nThe country would be a better place to live in, if there were more\r\nboys' and girls' clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTRACTING BIRDS\r\n\r\nThe country would be a better place to live in if there were more song\r\nbirds there. I know of a shrewd firm of real estate men, who wished\r\nto attract a certain class of residents to their suburban section,\r\nknowing that others would follow and property become more valuable.\r\nThey laid out the woodsy tract with as little change from the natural\r\nconditions as they could, and still have a sanitary, convenient, and\r\ncomfortable suburb. They did not chop down the trees in order to run\r\nstraight roads through, nor did they fill in the small gully that\r\nwanted to be a brook. They encouraged the brook and ran their roadways\r\nso as to avoid the big trees and give each building site a character of\r\nits own and privacy. Then they put a man in charge with strict orders\r\nto make the place attractive to song birds; to protect and feed them;\r\nto destroy their enemies. He was also to foster and encourage such wild\r\nflowers and ferns as grew naturally in the woods, and to propagate and\r\nincrease them so as to make the place a paradise. The man entered into\r\nthe spirit of their idea and succeeded wonderfully. The real estate\r\nmen advertised and the right people came and were convinced and bought\r\nhomes there and \"lived happy ever after.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBRINGING BACK THE SONG BIRDS\r\n\r\nHow can boys and girls bring back our song birds? I will not say\r\nmuch about why we want them, for in enlightened America we take\r\nit for granted. Some people still want to be convinced that birds\r\nare of practical value. I will say only that the damage to crops by\r\ninsects in nineteen hundred and four, is estimated at nine hundred and\r\nseventy-five million dollars. Investigations by scientists in state and\r\nnation all go to prove that a vast percentage of this loss could have\r\nbeen saved by birds. I wish every child would be ambitious to increase\r\nthe bird life on every farm, on every village block. Here are some\r\nfacts that ought to be convincing. I take them at random from my notes:\r\n\r\nKingbirds kill bot-flies.\r\n\r\nBrown thrashers feed mostly on insects, especially white grubs and\r\ncurculios.\r\n\r\nCat-birds, cuckoos and orioles are very important enemies of gypsy moth.\r\n\r\nThe red-eyed vireos are \"premium caterpillar hunters.\"\r\n\r\nBluebirds board themselves. Eat cut-worms, furry caterpillars, and\r\ngrasshoppers.\r\n\r\nWrens' food is ninety-eight per cent. animal matter.\r\n\r\nWarblers, titmice, creepers, and nut hatches eat lice.\r\n\r\nA pair of robins fed their nestlings this menu in three hours,\r\nbringing food every three minutes: sixty-one earth-worms, sixteen\r\nyellow grubs, thirty-eight other insects. Also four grasshoppers,\r\nseveral dragon flies, and a few moths.\r\n\r\nRobins rank first as enemies of white grub.\r\n\r\nKingbirds protect poultry by driving away hawks; ninety-eight per cent.\r\nof their food is insects, mostly injurious sorts.\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers destroy grubs in living trees. Phoebes catch flies,\r\nlighting on backs of cattle so as to be handy; also elm-leaf beetle,\r\nadults of canker-worms, cut-worms and gypsy.\r\n\r\nBaltimore orioles are worth their weight in gold as destroyers of gypsy\r\nand brown-tail moths.\r\n\r\nRose-breasted grosbeaks cleaned out potato beetles.\r\n\r\nScarlet tanagers ate gypsy moths at the rate of thirty-eight per minute\r\nfor eighteen consecutive minutes.\r\n\r\nThirty cedar waxwings will destroy ninety thousand canker-worms in a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nSo we can pile up the evidence in favour of the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ATTRACT BIRDS\r\n\r\nTwo words tell us what to do to increase bird life: provide and\r\nprotect. We must provide food, water, and nesting places. We must\r\nprotect from disturbance, from natural enemies, from destruction by\r\nhunters who sell the feathers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A birds' table hung with wires]\r\n\r\nAll over the country, laws to protect birds are being introduced into\r\nlegislatures. Boys and girls may think that they cannot do much to help\r\nmake laws. They can if their fathers are in the legislature as lots of\r\nfathers are, take the country over. Maybe your father does not know\r\nhow much birds are worth. Get him to read the bulletins issued by the\r\ngovernment. The boys who protect the birds around home will be the law\r\nmakers some fine day themselves. They'll \"see to it,\" then.\r\n\r\nBut now what can you do to-day? Is it winter? Feed the birds. There\r\nare many winter bird residents. Where are the insects in winter? Have\r\nthey gone south? Not a bit of it. They lurk under the bark on your\r\napple trees. They hide on the fence rails and under the leaves. Trust\r\nthe birds to find them unless snow prevents. The extra feeding you\r\ngive them will not toll them away from the insect food they love, but\r\nwill keep them \"on the job\" and will keep them from starving in stormy\r\nweather. Water, too, they often suffer for in winter. Supply it in\r\nshallow basins and slightly warmed. Tie suet to the trees; sacks made\r\nof loose netting will hold nut meats for them. Scatter grain for the\r\ngrain eaters on a platform.\r\n\r\nIn spring furnish nesting places and material, protection from cats and\r\ndistressing disturbances; mud for robins, string for orioles, floss,\r\nfeathers, and straw for others. Do something every day for your birds.\r\nDrinking fountains are a necessity, especially in towns where there is\r\nno running water. Shallow basins are best. They will often come right\r\nto the door and drink or bathe, unless frightened by some real or\r\nfancied danger. To make the birds tame you must make them feel safe,\r\nand supply their wants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAFFIC IN BIRD SKINS\r\n\r\nNot many girls wear birds' feathers in their hats. But many women do,\r\nand girls get to be women very soon. No one knows how many birds are\r\nslaughtered in America each year for hat trimmings. A few facts are\r\navailable such as: seventy thousand skins were sent in four months\r\nfrom a small district on Long Island; one New York house contracts\r\nto furnish to Paris forty thousand skins in one season; four hundred\r\nthousand bird skins from America sold in one London auction room in\r\nthree months. These numbers fairly stagger the reader. I don't know one\r\nAmerican girl who would kill a bird. If every one of them would refuse\r\never to wear any bird feathers there would be a great falling off in\r\nthis traffic.\r\n\r\nCollecting birds' eggs and nests is still quite common, and should be\r\ndiscouraged. The present state of the bird population does not warrant\r\nthe destruction of any except for the big museums. Their collectors\r\nare trained experts who collect only such birds as are needed for\r\nscientific purposes. They go at the right season to do the least\r\ndamage, and they do not slaughter by wholesale.\r\n\r\nBesides cats, which can be regulated to a certain extent in our homes,\r\nbirds have other enemies. Crows, though valuable insect eaters, are bad\r\nnest robbers and have been caught in the act of killing nestlings and\r\neven small adult birds. Snakes eat both eggs and young. Guards for cats\r\nwill keep out squirrels which molest the birds' nests. Ground nesting\r\nbirds may be protected with wire netting. Where this has been tried,\r\nin no case did it cause birds to desert the nests.\r\n\r\nBirds need thickets, hedge-rows and shrubbery for nesting places,\r\nhiding places, and shelter from storms.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer who kills the birds on his place justifies the destruction\r\nby the evidence that they eat fruit. True, some of them do. But if\r\nwater is provided many of them prefer it to fruit juice. To preserve\r\nour strawberries and cherries, we should plant June berry and Russian\r\nmulberry, which the birds like better. Chokeberry, buckthorn, elder\r\nberry, and mulberry will attract birds away from blackberry and\r\nraspberry patches. Wild cherry will protect the grapes, as both ripen\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATING WILD GAME\r\n\r\nThe country would be a more attractive place to live in if there were\r\nmore wild game. Thirty years ago, when I was a little girl in the\r\nmiddle West, my brothers used to shoot \"prairie chickens\" (grouse),\r\nquail (bob-white), wild geese, brant, wild ducks, and even bigger\r\nbirds. But now the guns are all rusty, and the powder flask is empty. I\r\ncame across the old wad-cutter in the attic and hardly recognized it.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made in several states to rear wild fowl in the\r\nbarn yard. Bob-white, grouse, mallard, wood ducks, and Canada geese\r\nare being experimented upon. A measure of success has already been\r\nachieved, but more experience is necessary especially with regard to\r\nthe feeding of the young birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A wood duck will nest in a box like this]\r\n\r\nProbably the wild fowl for young hunters to experiment with is wood\r\nduck or mallard. A man whose ten years' experience with raising wild\r\nfowl has earned him the title of expert, writes as follows: \"I think\r\nit would be a most useful work to educate our young people up to the\r\nfact that with a little patience and a small outlay they can help to\r\nincrease our supply of wild birds. For raising wood ducks, all one\r\nneeds is a small pond or even an artificial tank surrounded by a few\r\nbushes enclosed by a wire fence. In one corner, place a box on a post\r\nthree feet high with a cleated boardwalk leading up to a platform from\r\nwhich they can reach the entrance, which should be a round hole. Turn a\r\npair of wood ducks into the enclosure the first of March, and with luck\r\nyour duck will build her nest, and lay from eight to twelve eggs. In\r\nabout four weeks the eggs will hatch and the troubles commence.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that some kinds of wild geese are comparatively easy\r\nto raise and that they do not require much of a pond, but ample grazing\r\nfacilities, like their domestic relatives. Mallards, also, are very\r\neasy to raise.\r\n\r\nAs wild fowl bred in captivity bring a very good price and the demand\r\nis increasing with the spreading interest in the subject, raising wild\r\nfowl might be a source of income to an enterprising young man or woman.\r\n\r\nAll spring shooting of wild fowls ought to stop. Don't say, \"If I don't\r\nshoot them, somebody else will.\" That is not the attitude of a good\r\nsportsman. Public opinion among boys can only be established by boys.\r\nIf you don't believe in hunting in spring, when the ducks are laying\r\nor brooding the young, you can not only stop doing it, but you can\r\ninfluence others. Will you do this? To kill one mother duck this year\r\nmeans eight or ten less next year. It is a plain example in arithmetic\r\nto see what a big blunder you make if you shoot in spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GAME PRESERVE\r\n\r\nIf you live on a big farm or ranch well wooded and watered, your\r\nconditions are ideal for creating a private game preserve. If a few\r\nwild birds are known to be already at home on your place, encourage\r\nthem. Let them breed in security and plant their favourite food crops.\r\nSmall areas of land in various out of the way places can be ploughed\r\nand planted in spring to buckwheat and millet, wheat, rye, and barley.\r\n\r\nThe bob-white has become so rare that you will probably have to plant\r\nsome seed birds, as they say. They can be bought for five to ten\r\ndollars a dozen. Care should be taken that the birds are not frightened\r\nwhen liberated. To spend ten dollars for birds, only to lose them by\r\ncarelessness, is poor business. These suggestions are given by an\r\nexperienced game warden: \"Take the boxed birds out near some good,\r\nthick shelter where they can hide and gain confidence. Attach a long\r\nrope to a soap box, scatter grain about near the end of the box nearest\r\nthe cover, and scatter sheaf grain along toward the cover. Take only\r\nthree cocks and three hens from the shipping box and put them in the\r\nliberating box. Go some distance off and be deliberate. Let the quail\r\nget rested and quiet. Pull the long rope, lifting the box gently and\r\nsteadily. The birds will see the grain and hop out. Watch them from\r\nyour safe distance following the wheat toward the cover. Keep up the\r\nsupply of wheat until they are accustomed to their new home, and can\r\nfind their way back after roaming. Birds should not be planted later\r\nthan May first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING THE WILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nThe country would be a better place to live in the whole or part of the\r\nyear or to visit for a day or a week or a month if there were more wild\r\nflowers there. Even the man who doesn't know one flower from another\r\nwill acknowledge, if asked, that wild flowers make the woods and the\r\nroadsides and the meadows prettier to look at.\r\n\r\nThe country over, our loveliest wild flowers have met the same fate as\r\nthe bright-feathered birds. They have been hunted for their blossoms\r\nand the gatherers have not cared whether they pulled the plants up by\r\nthe roots or not. The case of trailing arbutus is a particularly sad\r\none. In localities where it used to flourish, selfish and wanton hands\r\nhave literally rooted it out until none remains.\r\n\r\nOnly lately has any effort been made to protect the wild flowers and\r\nmultiply them. Now, in the general awakening of the public to the fact\r\nthat we are blundering and wasteful, a widespread interest has grown up\r\nin saving the wild flowers.\r\n\r\nIn your own locality you can help this good work. Refrain from\r\ndestroying the plants yourself. When you gather flowers in woods or\r\nmeadow do so in moderation. A few loose, graceful sprays will give you\r\nas much pleasure as a huge bunch inartistically crowded into a vase.\r\nHave you not often seen children returning from a walk in the woods\r\nbearing handfuls of columbine? These frail blooms wilt in the hot sun,\r\nand the roadway is often strewn with forlorn bunches of them, dropped\r\nby tired children. How much better that each child should gather a few\r\nand put them all in a botanical case or wet paper to be distributed\r\nwhen they reach home. Those hundreds on the dusty road will never be\r\nvisited by the ruby-throated humming-bird, nor set any seed for next\r\nyear's flowers. Older boys and girls can do much to influence the\r\nyounger ones to gather sparingly.\r\n\r\nAnother way to increase the wild flowers in your locality is to\r\npropagate them. Gather their seeds and plant them in your garden\r\nwhere you can protect the young seedlings from harm. Where they are\r\nbig enough, set them out where they will have natural conditions. Or\r\nundertake a bit of wild gardening right in the woods or the roadside\r\nwhere the plants grow naturally. Clear out less desirable sorts,\r\nlessening the struggle for your favourites. Cultivate them a little.\r\nSee that they do not suffer from too much sun or rain or drought.\r\n\r\nIf you know of a plot of woodland soon to be denuded or a piece of wild\r\nland to be improved, get permission to gather bulbs, roots, and plants\r\nthere. If you know the flowers the year 'round, you will be able to\r\nrecognize the lilies, the orchids, the blood roots, the wild ginger,\r\nhepatica, violets, and can transplant them to your own woods or garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTING FOREST FIRES\r\n\r\nIt is October now, and this morning's paper had accounts of terrible\r\nforest fires raging in Minnesota. Hundreds dead, thousands homeless,\r\nand millions of dollars' worth of property wiped out.\r\n\r\nNobody knows, who has not fought fire, what a fiend the foresters have\r\nto deal with. I have looked up many forest fire statistics and I find\r\nalways noted among the \"sources of fires,\" this item: _Forest Fires Set\r\nBy Children_. There may not be much that boys and girls can _do_ to\r\nput in practice the big things we hear talked about under the name of\r\nconservation, but one thing you can certainly refrain from doing, and\r\nthat is, setting a forest fire. A person who makes a fire in the woods\r\nis responsible to the community for that fire and its consequences. To\r\nboil a coffee pail, to broil bacon, to bake biscuits, to fry fish, to\r\ngive comfort to the hunter, trapper, camper, or picnicker, many are the\r\nlegitimate uses of a fire in the woods. No real sportsman forgets his\r\nfire. His last act before leaving a camp is to see that no vestige of\r\nit remains. He makes sure every spark is dead, then throws on another\r\npail of water, and goes on with a light heart and a clear conscience.\r\nIf you have ever left a fire in the woods, anywhere, your conscience\r\nought to give you a good jab when you read of forest fires, though\r\ndistant, a jab that will prevent your repeating the offence.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING WEEDS\r\n\r\nWeeding is the boy's job, isn't it? If only one could get some kind of\r\ninspiration into weeding, so as to rob the work of its drudgery!\r\n\r\nIf we must serve our time at weeding, let us at least weed\r\nintelligently. What is a weed anyhow? In Germany, I am told, the\r\npeasants call weeds \"_Unkraut_\". Since \"_Kraut_\" is cabbage,\r\n\"_Unkraut_\" must be weeds.\r\n\r\nA weed is really a plant growing where we don't want it. The worst weed\r\nin a hill of four corn stalks is the fourth stalk of corn that crowds\r\nthe others. The worst weeds in a row of beets are the little beet\r\nplants that crowd each other. What a plague they are!\r\n\r\nSome of the plants we usually include among our \"coarse native weeds\"\r\nare grown in gardens in Europe. Mullein, for example, over there is\r\ncalled \"the American velvet plant\" and a well-grown specimen is really\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nIf weeds are plants out of place there is much to be done by boys and\r\ngirls in the way of ridding gardens, lawns, school grounds, and village\r\nstreets of their overgrowth of weeds. If you clear out one thing put in\r\nsomething better or nature may put in some plant that will not please\r\nyou. Save seeds from your own garden and drop them along the roadside.\r\n\r\nThe school grounds are the particular province of the school boys and\r\ngirls. Join together to make the grounds more beautiful and there is no\r\nend to the improvements that will follow.\r\n\r\nA lecturer once visited the school in a small village in the state\r\nof New York. On his way from the village to the school-house he was\r\nimpressed with two things: first, the wonderful size and vigour of the\r\nburdocks that seemed to have possession of even the front yards on the\r\nbusiness streets; and, second, the quantity of rubbish accumulated\r\non the margin of the pretty little stream which wandered under the\r\nbridges of the town. Do boys and girls know what public spirit is? Do\r\nyou know how your little village strikes a stranger? The lecturer was\r\nso struck by the sad state of the town that he made up his mind to\r\ntalk to the school about it. He did. He found that public spirit was\r\nnot dead there; it was only dormant. The boys and girls had passed by\r\nthe burdocks so often during their growth that they had taken them\r\nfor granted. They had so often thrown papers, broken dishes, worn-out\r\nbaskets, barrels, and rubbish over the bridges that they forgot to\r\nnotice how it looked. What else is an old creek like that good for\r\nanyhow? Can't go swimmin' in it.\r\n\r\nBefore the man finished his sociable little talk with the boys and\r\ngirls he had organized the younger ones into brigades of twenty to make\r\nwar on the burdocks. With the help of teachers and boys he mapped out\r\nthe town and assigned given localities to certain groups. Each group\r\nhad a captain with orders. The lecturer had a burdock plant brought in,\r\na tremendous one, root and all, from the school yard. He showed the\r\nboys and girls how well adapted this weed is to make a living, how by\r\nmeans of burs it steals rides, travelling from place to place, dropping\r\na few seeds here and a few there. He showed them the tough, long root\r\nand told them the plant's life history. Has the burdock any vulnerable\r\nspot they wondered? The only time when burdock is weak is when it comes\r\nup as a seedling. One scrape of the hoe would kill hundreds then.\r\n\r\nHearing what was up at school, an enterprising business man offered\r\nto give ten dollars to the squad of pupils who brought in the largest\r\nnumber of burdock plants. This added zest to the work and a generous\r\nemulation. Before the week was up, the town was rid of burdocks, and\r\nthere were wagon loads of them withering on the vacant lot near the\r\nschool. The squad that won the prize brought in upwards of seven\r\nhundred plants, root and branch. They donated the money to the school\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nThe boys and girls in that village didn't need to be waked up but\r\nonce. They went to work on the little stream. They had bonfires at the\r\nwater's edge. They planted willows and other water loving trees on the\r\nbanks, they asked the selectmen to pass a law to forbid the throwing of\r\nrubbish and sewage into the stream. They enforced the law themselves.\r\nThen they built two little dams, and made a skating pond right near the\r\nschool house.\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING RID OF POISON IVY\r\n\r\nIf there is any one thing that would make the country a better place\r\nto live in for some people, it would be to eradicate poison ivy. When\r\nit once gets possession of a fence row, it is an awful job to get it\r\nout. Cutting off the tops is about as effectual as cutting your hair.\r\nIt grows again thicker than ever. The roots and the creeping stems run\r\nunder ground and every cubic inch of soil has to be gone over.\r\n\r\nA great many beautiful plants will have to be destroyed in our fence\r\nrows in getting out the poison ivy. But we can replace these, and by\r\nconstant watchfulness keep the ivy out.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the village selectmen have seriously undertaken the\r\neradication. Any one who has ever suffered will agree that the work\r\nought to be taken hold of in a public way. Many people are immune.\r\nThose who know themselves to be so should undertake the work. A bounty\r\nis offered by some towns for uprooted plants.\r\n\r\nThe hands should be washed frequently with hot water and plenty of soap\r\nwhen working on poison ivy. Washable overalls and shirt should be worn,\r\nas the oil of the ivy gets on the garments and may poison any one who\r\nhandles them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSENING THE PLAGUE OF MOSQUITOES\r\n\r\nEvery boy and girl in the \"mosquito belt\" realizes keenly that the\r\ntowns as well as the country would be better places to live in if there\r\nwere no mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nSome people do not believe that it is possible to lessen this plague,\r\nmuch less end it. But such a belief is pure ignorance. I know of an\r\narmy post where in one season the mosquitoes were eradicated. It was\r\neasy there, because the post was isolated and because, when the\r\ncommandant issued a general order that all rain barrels were to be\r\ncovered or emptied, the people went right out and obeyed. You see, army\r\npeople get a fixed habit of obedience. Then the health officer, who\r\nreally had the matter most at heart, though backed by his superior,\r\nhad squads of prisoners at work gathering up and carting off tin cans\r\nor other rubbish capable of holding water. Pools were drained. Sewer\r\nopenings and ponds were oiled. Before the mosquitoes had fairly got out\r\nof winter quarters all the stagnant water was coated with an oil film.\r\nThere was no use trying to lay eggs under those conditions, so they\r\nleft for parts unknown. As mosquitoes cannot fly far unless carried by\r\nthe wind, they undoubtedly perished just outside the gates, and the\r\npeople came out and sat on their porches safe and happy. They were\r\nashamed that they had grumbled when the orders came to cover the rain\r\nwater barrels.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes breed in water. The wigglers of the watering trough or\r\nrain barrel are young mosquitoes. You can raise your own mosquitoes\r\nas well as your own chickens and pigs. A little precaution would save\r\nmuch annoyance. Neighbourhoods should unite to rid themselves of the\r\npest. Boys can do the work required. The school children in Worcester,\r\nMass., wage very effective war against mosquitoes every year under the\r\nguidance of their teachers. The saving in cost of netting and wire\r\nscreens would almost pay the expense of a campaign against mosquitoes\r\nand flies.\r\n\r\nAfter emptying or covering all the water receptacles on the place, it\r\nis well to place a few decoy pails in promising situations. When the\r\nmosquitoes have deposited their eggs, tip over the pails and that is\r\nthe end of that lot. One female can produce four hundred eggs, so you\r\nsee what a calamity it is for her young to come to maturity, which they\r\nmay do in eight to ten days.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes have their natural enemies. Where areas of water are too\r\nlarge to oil, we should see to it that fish are plentiful, especially\r\ngoldfish, sunfish, roaches, killies, and minnows. Toads, frogs, and\r\nlizards also prey on mosquitoes as do the nymphs of dragon flies and\r\nother water insects. Swallows and purple martins catch mosquitoes on\r\nthe wing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHTING FLIES\r\n\r\nThe house fly is no longer a mere nuisance, but is a menace to health.\r\nHe is well named the typhoid fly and the filth fly. The boys and girls\r\nwho help rid their neighbourhood of these disease-carrying pests are\r\nreal patriots.\r\n\r\nFlies are not a heaven-sent plague in this day and generation. Flies\r\nin the milk, flies in the pantry, flies on the kitchen door, flies\r\nbuzzing about the table, are the obvious result of carelessness and\r\nmismanagement. What is more, the remedies are not hard to apply. The\r\ntyphoid fly (house fly) breeds in horse manure. The adult fly feeds\r\nupon every known variety of filth as well as upon good food, but the\r\nundeveloped fly is a footless maggot and it breeds in your own and your\r\nneighbour's stable yard.\r\n\r\nPeople will go on buying fly paper, fly poison, fly traps, screen\r\ndoors, and window netting to keep flies out, but the very fly that has\r\nvisited a typhoid patient to-day may to-morrow leave the imprint of his\r\nfoul feet on the baby's face, or drown himself, but not his germs, in\r\nyour gravy.\r\n\r\nWhat does your father have a manure pile for? If he is a frugal farmer\r\nhe expects to put it on his fields when the other work is out of the\r\nway, and plough it in. He knows the value of manure on fields. But does\r\nhe realize that the best time to carry the manure out is while it is\r\nnew? Every expert will tell him so and why. In the pile by the barn\r\nit lies and burns. Have you seen it smoke? Burnt manure is wasted\r\nfertilizer. When it rains, the valuable elements needed by the soil\r\nleach out and nourish the crop of \"jimson weeds\" and burdocks that will\r\ncrowd round the barn yard next year.\r\n\r\nMeantime the flies buzz round the manure pile. The worse it smells\r\nthe better they like it. They are there for business. Eggs, thousands\r\nupon thousands of tiny flies' eggs, are deposited by industrious and\r\nprolific flies. A fly's egg! The hired man will laugh at you for\r\nbothering over a thing so insignificant. But when his wife comes down\r\nwith typhoid and the flies come in and worry her, he will complain\r\nof his luck and drive out the flies, which go merrily forth to start\r\nlittle private epidemics all over the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nDestroy their breeding places. That is one remedy for flies. Trap them,\r\npoison them, discourage them.\r\n\r\nIs it worth while for you to do this when the rest of the people do\r\nnot? Yes, indeed. If you have very near neighbours, their flies may get\r\nto you to some extent, but with nothing to furnish breeding places, and\r\nno foul-smelling swill or decaying animal or vegetable stuff around,\r\nthey will not be attracted to your place. Awaken the neighbour's\r\ninterest in your \"fly-destroying crusade.\" If you can reach results\r\nbest by forming a club, organize and pass resolutions and wake people\r\nup to their responsibilities. This is practical work for a boys' good\r\ncitizenship club.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING\r\n\r\nI know a city boy who is fortunate enough to have a farm home to\r\ngo to as soon as school closes in the summer. With his parents and\r\nbrothers and sisters he lives the life of the farm boy, with enough of\r\ngardening, a little of chicken raising, one cow to milk, and a chance\r\nto measure his cunning against that of many \"varmints\" which would\r\notherwise destroy his garden and steal his chickens. He knows how to\r\nuse a gun, and when, and where. He can make a good trap, a scientific\r\nand humane trap, and he knows the ways of the two-or four-or six-footed\r\nenemies he is at war with. Between them and him there is a fair field\r\nand no favours, just as between one wild creature and another. If\r\nto-day he outwits a crow, to-morrow a skunk pays the crow's score with\r\nheavy interest by making a meal of a nestful of young chickens.\r\n\r\nThis boy has learned enough of the art of preparing skins to make those\r\nhe gets salable, and he exhibits with just pride a handsome fur skating\r\ncap made by his mother out of skins of mink he has taken. His traps\r\nadd something every year to his growing college fund.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple box-trap]\r\n\r\nThere are a great many things about the business of trapping that seem\r\nvery horrible and brutal to a sensitive person. Because many cruel men\r\nhave gone into that life, which is a life of the greatest hardship and\r\nhas little in it to encourage gentleness, we have rather taken it for\r\ngranted that all trapping is unjustifiable and that a boy who wants to\r\nset traps is an inhuman monster and not to be tolerated in a civilized\r\nhome. If fathers and mothers were all like my young friend's parents,\r\nthey would see that trapping ought to be a part of a boy's training,\r\njust like using an axe, or a saw, or a gun.\r\n\r\nTrapping everything would be bad business. You would not catch\r\nsquirrels in a trap any more than you would shoot bluebirds or brown\r\nthrashers. One could easily damage his neighbourhood and himself by\r\ntrapping the wrong things or trapping in the wrong way. A trapper who\r\nis a sportsman will see to it that his traps are of the right kind.\r\nI would not have a mouse-trap in the house that made a practice of\r\ncatching mice by the foot or tail. There are traps of many kinds for a\r\nvariety of purposes and the trapper must either catch his prey alive\r\nand provide a way of despatching it humanely or use a trap which is\r\ninstantaneous in its deadly work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box-trap and figure 4]\r\n\r\nBoys who have learned to trap in the natural, legitimate way do not\r\nbecome \"fish butchers\" or \"game hogs\" when they grow up. I once saw\r\na picture of a game warden standing triumphantly beside a mound of\r\ndead crows, two thousand and twelve was the number, I believe. He had\r\ncunningly learned to imitate their call so successfully that they\r\ncould not resist coming within range of his deadly weapon. Crows may be\r\nharmful to wild fowl but no boy with right instincts would be guilty of\r\nan act so base as this, so unbecoming a sportsman and a gentleman.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of the animals which prey upon orchard, garden, and chicken\r\nroost is, without question, one of the ways of making the country a\r\nbetter place to live in. Trapping may be regarded as clean sport when\r\ndone for this purpose, or for food when needed. Catching animals alive\r\nfor the sake of taming and training them as pets is treated in another\r\nchapter and has its own rules.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of fur-bearing animals which, though too shy to\r\nventure inside the barn yard, prey so successfully upon the less\r\nfortunate ones, that it has become our duty to take up warfare against\r\nthem. This duty is all the more heavily laid upon us because, in the\r\nact of civilizing the woods and converting the hills and valleys into\r\ncultivated fields and pastures, we have destroyed the natural hiding\r\nplaces of the wild things and \"upset the balance.\" If we were suddenly\r\nto abandon this country, it would not be many generations before the\r\nbuffalo, the wild pigeon, and the wild turkey would return to their\r\nhaunts, the forests would recover the hills, the potato beetle would\r\ngo back to its Colorado weed, and some natural enemy would control the\r\nSan José scale and the English sparrow and reduce them to their natural\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn some localities trapping of fur-bearing animals is still a\r\nmoney-making small industry and if properly carried on will lead to no\r\nevil results. The more a boy knows about the habits of the animals he\r\nseeks to outwit, the greater will be his chances of a capture, and when\r\nhe knows a little he will want to know more. He will learn that there\r\nare rules in this game as well as in games with his human fellows,\r\nand that there are things \"that no man would do,\" and pretend to\r\nself-respect. A knowledge of woodcraft is indispensable to the trapper\r\nand helps him to take care of himself and act with good judgment in\r\ncases of emergency.\r\n\r\nA boy that sets a trap takes a certain responsibility. If he fails to\r\nvisit his traps he breaks a rule of the game. A live animal in a cage\r\ntrap begins to suffer very soon for water and for food. An animal in a\r\nsteel trap, if not dead, will often pull or even gnaw off his injured\r\nleg, and escape. His tragic story may often be read in his footprints\r\nin the snow. If trapping for skins you must take them off while fresh,\r\nas they taint very quickly and may be ruined by delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING MINK\r\n\r\nThe boy that catches a mink is a pretty lucky boy in these days when\r\nthose wily little robbers have grown so scarce. The price of mink fur\r\nmade into muffs and collars is so high as to make a mink skin worth\r\ntrying for. I can imagine the surprise and well-earned triumph of my\r\nyoung trapping friend when, after trying for a year or two to solve the\r\nmystery of the disappearance of his thoroughbred chickens, he finally\r\nsucceeded in capturing a fine mink. A friend of his to whom he had\r\ntaught all he could of the art of trapping caught another. And this\r\nhappened within the city limits of the nation's capital! Who says now\r\nthat the mink has disappeared?\r\n\r\nThe mink is a flesh-eater, and lives on what he can catch, varying his\r\nbill of fare with frogs, snakes, birds, mice, muskrats, and fish. It\r\nis always open season for trout in the mink's code of laws and though\r\nhe is not a water animal his home is more than likely to be near a\r\ntrout stream, on the bank, in a well-concealed place. It is not fair\r\nto trap mink in the breeding season, which is April or May. The young\r\nare at the mercy of all sorts of flesh-eaters, including their own\r\nfathers, who are a most undiscriminating sort. There ought to be some\r\nform of guarantee to a mink mother that while she is foraging for food\r\nfor her young she will not be enticed into a trap. Later, when she\r\ngoes a-hunting on her own account and the chances are even, she is\r\nlegitimate prey for the trapper.\r\n\r\nSteel traps are best, say the experts, and they should be cunningly\r\nconcealed. Gouge out a sort of hole in the bank, conceal the trap\r\nat the front, and put the bait farther in so that the trap must be\r\npassed to reach the bait. Muskrat flesh, fish, or other meat is the\r\nbait used. A common practice is to scorch the bait, to make the odour\r\nmore pervasive and attractive. The price of fresh mink skins varies\r\naccording to size and condition from two dollars and a half to four\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING SKUNKS\r\n\r\nThe last thing you would expect of a skunk is that he should be popular\r\namong the girls. But under the seductive title of Alaska sable, the\r\nfur of the plain Jersey or York State skunk is worn with satisfaction\r\nby ladies of good sense and good taste. A skunk's pelt is worth two\r\ndollars and a half or more and although he is of undoubted value to\r\nthe farmer as a destroyer of insect pests, I shall not undertake his\r\ndefence. A cloud of witnesses would rise up to recount their losses\r\nfrom the marauding skunk. His fondness for poultry would be mere\r\ncircumstantial evidence that he is an enemy of the wild birds as well,\r\nbut we have direct evidence enough to convict and condemn him. Because\r\nof his unusual weapon, used only when hard-pressed in an unequal\r\nbattle, a good deal of special precaution has to be taken when trapping\r\n_Mephitis_ for his fur. The least taint of the unmistakable odour ruins\r\nthe skin, as no cleansing compound has been invented strong enough to\r\nremove it or drown it. It is said on good authority that the skunk\r\nseldom besprinkles itself when discharging its \"rear battery.\"\r\n\r\nSkunks are not very clever nor very swift. They go about at night for\r\nthe most part, or early evening. The young are born, six to nine in\r\na litter, in April or May. The nests are hidden in holes in hollow\r\ntrees, among rocks, or in the ground. The young ones frequently follow\r\nthe old ones all summer or even longer, little realizing that this is\r\na dangerous habit. By tracking them from the scene of their nocturnal\r\nvisit to or from the stream they run to daily for water, one may find\r\nthe hiding place. A clever trapper succeeds in capturing a whole family\r\nofttimes by simply making the path the skunks follow more distinct,\r\ntreading down the grass, and even setting up sticks to guide them along\r\ntoward the place they wish to go. Traps with bits of meat for bait are\r\nset at intervals along the path. A snare and spring pole are said to\r\ninsure no bad consequences. One author advises the hunter that striking\r\na sudden blow near the tail paralyzes the ejecting muscles. No doubt!\r\nBut in the meantime what is the skunk doing?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deadfall trap]\r\n\r\nThe white stripe on the skunk's back, while a valuable warning to\r\nall of what is approaching, is a disadvantage from the trapper's\r\nviewpoint. This stripe varies in length and some varieties are without\r\nit entirely. There is a story of the days when the Indians in western\r\nNew York used to bring in many skunk skins to the local fur-buyer. One\r\nred man, a notorious cheat, came in one day with a single skin to sell.\r\n\r\n\"Long stripe or short stripe,\" said the buyer, whose prices varied with\r\nthe length of the white stripe on the skunk's back.\r\n\r\n\"Ver' short stripe. How much pay?\" said the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the skin,\" said the buyer.\r\n\r\nThe Indian showed the skin, which was that of a young animal, and very\r\nsmall, the stripe extending the entire length of the skin.\r\n\r\n\"You said short stripe,\" said the indignant buyer, pointing the finger\r\nof scorn at the runty little skin.\r\n\r\n\"Short skunk, short stripe,\" said the Indian with a shrug. \"What you\r\npay?\"\r\n\r\nI cut out an item from the daily paper last week which had this\r\nheadline: \"Skunks sent him to college.\" Can you draw your own\r\ninferences? The fur of skunks is very valuable now and in many\r\nfashionable Paris shops it is advertised with large placards printed\r\ndistinctly for their English-speaking customers, \"_Veritable Skong_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING WOODCHUCKS\r\n\r\nJudging by the tales they tell, New England boys of the passing\r\ngeneration spent most of their time trying to outwit the woodchucks\r\nwhich infested their farms. If all their tales were true, the barn\r\ndoors of their respective states must have needed stretching to hold\r\nall the skins of all those woodchucks, and no boy could possibly\r\nhave been long without that valuable possession, a whiplash made of\r\nwoodchuck hide. This little cousin of the squirrels is neither very\r\nfleet nor very cunning. He has, though, very quick ears and quicker\r\neyes, and knows that his hole is the safest place for him when boys are\r\naround.\r\n\r\nThe only excuse for hunting woodchucks is that they sometimes get so\r\nnumerous as to do real damage in the garden, either by their holes\r\nand the mounds of earth they throw out, or by eating more vegetables\r\nthan can reasonably be spared. A better game than hunting them would\r\nbe to discover how they build their underground galleries. Are these\r\nmere holes deep enough to crawl into for safety? Is there more than\r\none tunnel? Has the owner an exit as well as an entrance to his home?\r\nHas he a nest, and where and what is it? Does he hoard for winter, or\r\nhibernate?\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING MOLES\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get a new point of view. Having been brought up in the\r\nbelief that the mole is a nuisance, pure and simple, I find myself\r\nunable on short notice to believe that this little blind miner is\r\nactually useful. If only he would confine his sphere of usefulness\r\nto some other neighbourhood than our lawn! We all think that his\r\nunderground passages disfigure the lawn. But does the grass die where\r\nthe tunnels run? I think not. You see patches of dead grass on many\r\nlawns, but do you find moles at work in these same lawns? In fact, the\r\nbrown, dead patches of grass are probably killed by the white grub,\r\narch enemy of grass roots. The mole is arch enemy to the white grub and\r\nothers of his ilk. According to people who know about moles, we ought\r\nto decorate them with medals instead of trapping them and decorating\r\nthe barn door with their tiny skins.\r\n\r\nThe first mole I ever saw was one brought in by our old cat. She laid\r\nit down with a sort of shamefaced air as much as to say, \"Things\r\nhave come to a pretty pass when a self-respecting cat is obliged to\r\nbring in the likes of that. It fair turns my stomach!\" It was not an\r\nattractive object, but we children turned it over and over with a\r\nstick. What an odd shape, so unlike the animals familiar to us. Its\r\nnose like a gimlet, its fore feet like little shovels; no wonder it\r\ncould tunnel. No eyes, no ears; but what use has a mole for either? Do\r\nyou know what Oliver Herford said of the mole?\r\n\r\n    \"See, children, the misguided mole,\r\n    He lives down in a deep, dark hole;\r\n    Sweetness and light and good fresh air\r\n    Are things for which he does not care.\r\n    But say not that he has no soul,\r\n    Lest haply we misjudge the mole.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can say that the mole has not a redeeming feature. Surely there\r\nis no creature clad in a coat of more surpassing softness and fineness\r\nthan the mole. Are the exquisite \"moleskin\" garments sometimes seen in\r\nfurriers' windows really made of tiny skins of this despised little\r\nquadruped?\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that any of us will ever catch many moles. If they\r\nare troublesome in your lawn, you and the neighbour boys can do some\r\ntrapping with mole traps. They are of a kind specially fitted to outwit\r\nthe mole in his tunnel, and directions accompany each trap.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery boy knows what \"knuckle down\" means and how sore your knuckles\r\nget in marble time. There is usually one boy in the crowd who is lucky\r\nenough to have a knuckle dabster, made of moleskin. \"There, use that.\r\nSoft as velvet, eh? Nope, don't want to sell it. Caught a mole last\r\nsummer, tanned the skin myself and my mother made this for me, like the\r\none in 'The Boy's Own Book.' Wouldn't take a dollar for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING MUSKRATS\r\n\r\nThe first fur collar I ever had was sold to me as \"electric seal.\"\r\nThere was no deception practised on me, for I knew that the fur\r\nwas neither electric nor seal. But I didn't know then that it was\r\nmuskrat fur. They call it Hudson seal nowadays, I believe. These\r\nsmall relatives of the beaver have so few natural enemies, and are so\r\nprolific that they are in no danger of disappearing from our ponds\r\nand sluggish streams. The beaver, on the other hand, is supposed to\r\nbe protected by law. Until it is against the law to sell and to wear\r\nbeaver skins, trappers will evade the law and escape the fines.\r\n\r\nMuskrat fur is not so fine nor thick as that of the beaver and not\r\nnearly so expensive. A fresh skin is worth twenty-five to forty cents.\r\nThey are more in demand now than ever, owing to the fashionable demand\r\nfor furs and the scarcity of other fur-bearing animals. There are many\r\nways of trapping them. As they are aquatic and active in the winter\r\nthey are often taken through the ice. Muskrat trappers are always good\r\nskaters. A hard blow on the ice will stun the rat, which is pulled out\r\nthrough a hole. They are sometimes speared through holes in the ice. A\r\nboy might develop enough patience and perseverance, as well as skill\r\nand alertness, in a job like this to make it pay better in some other\r\nfield than the sale of the skins.\r\n\r\nMuskrats are often caught in traps, too. To be successful at this it\r\nis necessary to learn a great deal about the little fellow's habits of\r\nlife, his house, his food and his ways of escaping enemies. It is well\r\nto know his enemies, too. These are the fox, the mink, and the otter.\r\nYou would be a lucky boy, indeed, if instead of common little musquash\r\nyou bagged an otter whose pelt is worth fifteen or twenty dollars. My\r\nfather has an otter skin cap about which he and my uncle tell a truly\r\nexciting story. They caught an otter, but that was sixty odd years ago.\r\n\r\nMuskrats are the greatest nuisance in ornamental grounds where there\r\nare large water features. They have an unfortunate fondness for lily\r\nbulbs. The boy who can outwit them will win favour with the gardener\r\nand the garden's owner, with the muskrat skins thrown in.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING GOPHERS\r\n\r\nOur old dog Nimp was convinced that the way to get a gopher was to dig\r\nhim out. Doctor Hornaday tells an amusing story about his having that\r\nsame conviction when a boy. Many a night Nimp would come home from the\r\npasture, panting, his coat all rough with the reddish soil that we knew\r\nhad come out of a gopher hole. Weary, yes, but discouraged, never. The\r\nold dog would go back to his job morning after morning. Sometimes we\r\nwould try to help by carrying buckets full of water and \"drowning him\r\nout.\" Never did Nimp scent a gopher near the cattle well but once,\r\nand then the boys drowned him out with a vengeance. The hunted little\r\ncreature leaped out of a hole so unexpectedly near where the boys sat\r\nthat one turned a complete somersault and landed in the last pailful of\r\nwater. Nimp was quicker than his masters and soon laid the bedraggled\r\nlittle miner at our feet. We felt pretty small.\r\n\r\nVery little can be said in defence of the gopher. He is an undeniable\r\nnuisance and helps to bring the farmer's crop down to a lower figure\r\nthan it ought to be. Traps and poisoned vegetables are swifter methods\r\nof dealing with the case than digging, for the gopher is himself past\r\nmaster in the art of digging.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING THE WEASEL\r\n\r\nOne of the natural enemies of the pocket gopher is the weasel. If only\r\nwe could set the weasel on the gopher and then had something like a\r\nmongoose to keep down the weasels! I never yet heard a good word for\r\nthe weasel. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is mean and sly\r\nand hateful. It is undeniable that he does not obey the laws of the\r\nwoods, that he kills for the mere joy of killing, and that is a high\r\ncrime. Men with weasel-like ways get to have the same blood-thirsty\r\nlook. The weasel is a savage, hunting every wild creature in the woods,\r\nrabbits, mice, chipmunks, moles, rats, grouse, chickens, and ducks, and\r\neven insects. He robs the nests of birds, eats eggs and young, and even\r\nthe old birds are not safe from him.\r\n\r\nI just read in a book that \"weasels are so small that their fur has\r\nlittle value, but the time will come when it will be eagerly sought\r\nand used.\" Well, that time has come, but, who ever went to a shop and\r\nasked for a weasel tippet? But ask for ermine and they will show any\r\nquantity of it. The price! Well, wouldn't the weasel be surprised to\r\nfind himself so popular. It all comes about because of that interesting\r\nhabit of his, changing colour in the winter. The weasel is a sort of\r\npeculiar shade of brown as you can testify if you have caught one; the\r\nermine is pure white all but the tippest tip of the tail which is dead\r\nblack; yet they are one and the same. Weasel in summer and ermine in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe weasel, the mink, and the marten are all enemies of the native\r\nwild game, and efforts to exterminate them are always applauded by\r\nsportsmen. Much is yet to be learned of their habits. Trappers have\r\nsucceeded in keeping the mink and marten in check, but the weasel goes\r\nhis murderous way, feared and hated by everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING RATS\r\n\r\nThere is no pest around the farm yard or barn yard anywhere so hard to\r\ncope with when once they get a foothold, as rats. Finding them numerous\r\nin the barn once, we put chicken feed in the uncemented cellar of the\r\nhouse. Before the end of the first winter of that arrangement we were\r\npraying for a visit from the Pied Piper. The rats took possession. They\r\nbroke dishes, seemingly for the fun of it; they gnawed the softened\r\nwoodwork around the kitchen sink and held high carnival at midnight\r\nthroughout the spaces between the walls; they all but bit the babies in\r\ntheir cradles and defied all our efforts to outwit them. Traps, cats,\r\npoison, we tried everything, but they outstayed us. If ever we get into\r\na like case again I shall be tempted to try ferrets or cyanide.\r\n\r\nSome people are successful trappers of rats, and these suggestions come\r\nfrom them. Set a trap in a pan of meal or bran, cover with same and\r\nput it in a runway. Make the runway easy to pass through by placing\r\nboards or boxes along near the walls. Cover a trap with thin brown\r\npaper or cloth and set it in the runway. Smoke the trap over the fire\r\nand heat it hot (not hot enough to draw the temper of the steel), after\r\neach setting. Change the place of the trap very often. Wear gloves to\r\nkeep the odour of your hands from the trap. The rat is the very wisest\r\nof all his family, his behaviour seems to be the result of impish\r\nintelligence rather than mere instinct for self-preservation.\r\n\r\nNo true sportsman will allow his antipathy to rats or weasels to lead\r\nhim to commit acts of cruelty. Fighting them with their own methods\r\nmakes you into a human rat or weasel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPPING RABBITS\r\n\r\nThere are times when rabbits get too numerous, and times when they are\r\nneeded to eat, and times when you want to try your hand at taming a\r\nwild one. Under these circumstances it is legitimate sport to hunt or\r\ntrap them. If damage is being done to crops in the spring we shall be\r\nforced to wage war against them in self-defence during their breeding\r\nseason. Otherwise no sportsman would do it. If there is so little\r\nlegitimate rabbit food in winter that they are driven to destroy fruit\r\ntrees to get a little bark, then the inference is that there are too\r\nmany rabbits. Study the rabbit's ways of living, and learn his weak\r\npoints. Find out if he has a \"tendon of Achilles\" or vulnerable spot.\r\nLook one over. What are his conspicuous characteristics? Is it not\r\nevident that his life is one long series of narrow escapes? He has\r\nfew, if any, wits; how low his forehead. Timid eyes. But ears! Can he\r\nnot hear you coming a mile off? And LEGS! Did you ever see a greater\r\ndevelopment in that direction? Yes, in a grasshopper, but nowhere else.\r\nThe rabbit is a perfect mammalian grasshopper. When you stop to think\r\nof it you will see a certain pathetic side to its life.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit has its wild enemies, ever watchful, ever close on its\r\ntrail. The hawk, the mink, the weasel, the fox, the lynx, and others\r\nare rabbit hunters. Besides his quick hearing, and his swiftness, Br'er\r\nRabbit has a wonderful power of becoming invisible. His nondescript\r\ncolour, combined with his ability to \"freeze,\" serve him as well\r\nas a cloak of darkness. The cotton-tail rabbit is commonest in the\r\nMiddle and Southern states, while his bigger cousin, the varying hare,\r\noverlaps the rabbit's territory in the colder parts, and takes his\r\nplace in the most Northern states. The varying hare is called also the\r\nsnow-shoe rabbit and the white hare, but in summer he is dull russet\r\nbrown. You may have heard of the wonderful change of colour of this and\r\nother animals. Interesting stories are told of the sudden blanching\r\nof the fur, of its turning white, \"in a single night,\" like the locks\r\nof the prisoner of Chillon. Not a word of truth in that story. Why do\r\npeople, whose only fitness for telling stories lies in their having an\r\nimagination, make up such yarns about real things? They could invent\r\nan animal and then tell as many wonderful tales as they liked and\r\nnobody would be deceived. The truth about animals is wonderful enough.\r\nIf writers would only take pains to find out the truth instead of\r\nrepeating fancies!\r\n\r\nSuppose the early ancestor of the white hare had a grayish-brownish\r\ncoat, just the thing to protect him from his enemies in a world all\r\nfull of grayish-brownish things. But one day there came a snow storm,\r\nand all the gray-brown things were covered with whiteness, except the\r\npoor hare. Suddenly he became the most noticeable object in the woods.\r\nThen all his neighbours saw him and wanted him, and mostly they got him.\r\n\r\nIt was about then that the hare began to be the \"varying hare.\" A law\r\nof nature came to his rescue. Some hares there were which were not so\r\ndark coloured as others. They may have been longer winded and swifter\r\nfooted, too, but anyhow they escaped and lived to bring families into\r\nthe world. As like breeds like, these young hares took after their\r\nparents, and because they were lighter coloured in the winter they in\r\nturn escaped and carried this peculiarity into the next generation.\r\nIt took endless years, and innumerable generations of hares, varying\r\nthis way and that to fulfill this natural law, and fix the habit. But\r\nnow that it is fixed we may well view it with wonder, and call it an\r\nexample of the law of the \"survival of the fittest.\" How is the change\r\nbrought about? Just as the chickens and the birds moult, and the horse\r\nsheds, so do the rabbits. Their summer coats are thinner and brown. One\r\nby one the brown hairs fall out in the fall till finally the new coat\r\nis there, which is white. It is not like the human hair changing from\r\nbrown to white. In the fall and then again in the spring there is a\r\ntime when the varying hare is a variegated hare, his coat being mottled\r\nwith white and brown.\r\n\r\nRabbits are hunted with dogs and their trails in the new snow are\r\neasily followed by the hunter alone. They are caught in traps and\r\nsnares of various kinds. In one of his lessons in woodcraft, Mr. Seton\r\ndescribes a rabbit snare as follows: \"String, a shoe-lace, a buckskin\r\nthong, or even a strip of clothing may be used as a snare. There are\r\nmany ways of making a rabbit snare, but the simplest is the best. The\r\nessentials are, first, the snare--an ordinary running noose; second, a\r\ntwitch-up--that is a branch bent down or a pole set in the crotch of a\r\nsapling. The snare is fast to the end of the pole, and spread open in a\r\nwell worn runway. The loop is about four inches across and placed four\r\ninches from the ground. The pole twitch-up is held down by placing\r\nthe cross-piece of the snare under some projecting snag. The rabbit\r\nbounding along, puts his head in the noose, the slight jerk frees the\r\ncross-piece from its holder, and in a moment the rabbit is dangling in\r\nair.\"\r\n\r\nRabbit fur is not very durable but is much used for the manufacture of\r\nless expensive fur garments. Under the name of \"French seal\" it finds a\r\nready market and is really soft and pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAPS THAT BOYS CAN MAKE\r\n\r\nThere are a number of traps and snares that boys can make. Descriptions\r\nof these are to be found in books on amateur carpentry, manual\r\ntraining, and books for boys of various kinds. The illustrations in\r\nthis chapter are intended to give a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONEY AND RECREATION IN TRAPPING\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to go at this subject from a professional side,\r\nas I think no boys care to trap for a living. Whatever may be said\r\nabout the boy having a gun in a thickly settled suburb, nothing can be\r\noffered against his trapping if he goes at it in an amateur way and\r\nwith no intent to exterminate the animals (which only a shrewd trapper\r\ncould do).\r\n\r\nI will presume the boy to be attending a neighbouring school either\r\non the edge of a city or in a town. Under these circumstances he must\r\nattend to his traps early in the morning or after school. At first\r\nthere may be no more than enough money in it to cover the cost of\r\ntraps, but nevertheless the recreation which it offers will appeal to\r\nthe average boy. As his knowledge of animals becomes greater with time,\r\nhe will get more and more pocket money.\r\n\r\nWhen he starts in, the other boys may laugh at him and say that there\r\nis nothing to trap. In most cases they would make a big mistake,\r\nbecause there often are, on the edge of a city, more fur-bearing\r\nanimals than in the surrounding country. This for the reason that the\r\nprofessional trapper is not present and most of the city boys do not\r\nknow how to trap. There are, say, muskrats and an occasional mink along\r\nthe rivers and streams. The swamps usually abound in muskrats. In the\r\nwoods and fields are squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, and (in\r\nthe North) woodchucks.\r\n\r\nIt is legitimate to catch the water animals in ordinary steel traps\r\nbecause, if set right, the captive is instantly drowned. For dry land\r\nthe steel jaw-trap is not suitable, because it will rarely kill the\r\nanimal, but cause him much suffering as it usually breaks his leg.\r\nOften in such case the trapper will only find a foot in his trap, the\r\nanimal having gnawed or twisted his body free. Nevertheless any trap is\r\nhumane which kills the animal instantly. There are many new traps on\r\nthe market which will do this, but on account of their being patented\r\nand high-priced they are not extensively used. The traps which are most\r\ncommonly used for this purpose are the deadfalls and snares.\r\n\r\nThe muskrat lives wherever there is a body of water. He feeds chiefly\r\non vegetable matter which he obtains in the swamps or digs on the\r\nbanks, although he frequently visits a cornfield or vegetable garden.\r\nOnly in cases of extreme hunger, as happens when they are frozen in,\r\nhave they been known to eat their own kin. In swamps they have houses\r\nmade of rushes and twigs, standing in a rounded shape about two feet\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nTo trap in the swamps one must have high rubber boots and if the water\r\nis deep a small boat is necessary. A home-made flat-bottomed canoe,\r\nmade of canvas, will be found to answer the purpose admirably. Where\r\nit is shallow enough to use the boots, a long, heavy staff should be\r\ncarried, as the mud is very often treacherous and interwoven with\r\nmuskrat runways. I might as well say in the beginning that the\r\nintending trapper should take a friend into his confidence and the two\r\nset out to trap together, for in this way they can help each other out\r\nof difficulties. (My friend had to do some pretty stiff pulling once to\r\nget me out of a mud hole into which I had recklessly plunged, having\r\nonly in my mind to get to my traps quickly.)\r\n\r\nAlong the rivers the muskrats live in holes in the banks. In trapping\r\nin such places one may walk along the bank or use a boat, setting the\r\ntraps in the entrances of houses or in the runs.\r\n\r\nBefore the trapping season begins it is very wise to go over the\r\nterritory and locate the different houses, runways, and feeding places.\r\nThis will save time when trapping begins, which should not be before\r\nDecember, because up to this time the pelts are not in their prime. The\r\ntrapping season lasts for about three months or until the ice breaks up\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\nIf the water is not yet iced over, the muskrats can be caught with the\r\nsteel jaw-traps. They should be set in the runs or at the entrances\r\nof houses so that they are just under the surface of the water. The\r\nchain should be staked in the water as far out as possible. The muskrat\r\nwill in every instance try to swim out into deep water and the weight\r\nof the trap on his foot will pull him down and drown him. Traps may\r\nbe baited with apples, carrots, turnips, and nearly any vegetable or\r\nfruit. The bait should be stuck on a slanting stick so that it will\r\nhang about a foot above the pan of the trap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Stop thief\" trap]\r\n\r\nWhen the water is frozen over, other methods must be followed. Many\r\ntrappers cut the houses open and set the traps on the inside, but those\r\nwho wish to keep the muskrats in the vicinity will not do this, because\r\nit destroys their homes and causes them to seek new shelter. For my own\r\nuse I have \"stop thief\" traps which kill instantly and are not very\r\nexpensive. A hole is cut in the ice and the trap set before the house\r\nentrance or in a swimway. In going through, the muskrat puts his foot\r\non lever _a_, which releases _b_, and this in turn lets down lever _c_,\r\nwhich strikes him over the neck or back, breaking it instantly. As\r\nshown, the trap is fastened with staples to a wooden prong, one end of\r\nwhich is stuck in the mud at the bottom and the other fits just under\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\nMink are rarely caught, because they are very crafty and keen to the\r\nscent of a human being. Once in a while they are caught in a trap set\r\nin the water or in the entrance to a muskrat house. This is accounted\r\nfor by the fact that the mink preys largely upon these weaker animals\r\nin the winter when food is scarce. Sometimes they can be lured with\r\na muskrat carcass or a dead bird. If the trap is not set under water\r\nthere is little probability of getting the mink. The trapping of mink\r\nshould be encouraged, because they kill not only muskrats, but chickens\r\nand other domestic fowl as well. One must use his own judgment and set\r\nhis trap in a place frequented by the mink. Prime mink skins usually\r\nbring three or four dollars from any local fur dealer. On the other\r\nhand muskrats are more plentiful and bring only about thirty cents.\r\nThus it is that some boys prefer to keep the muskrat skins and tan\r\nthem at home. From these skins they make comfortable caps and gloves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stretchers for skins. The narrow one for mink, the other\r\nfor muskrat]\r\n\r\nTo skin the muskrat and mink, commence on the hind legs. The skin is\r\nslit down one leg and up the other. With muskrats the tail is cut away\r\nfrom the rest of the skin. The mink's tail adds greatly to the value of\r\nthe skin, so the bone is carefully extracted with a pair of pincers and\r\nthe tail left on the skin. The skin is then gradually peeled down over\r\nthe body and head. It is then stretched with the fur side inward on a\r\nboard as shown in the figure on this page. After this it is hung in a\r\ndry, airy place to dry, away from the sun. For home tanning a fresh\r\npelt needs only salt, but the following solution gives somewhat better\r\nresults and makes the skin more pliable:\r\n\r\n        Salt, two pounds.\r\n\r\n        Sulphuric acid (com.) two ounces.\r\n\r\n        Rain water, one gallon.\r\n\r\nThe pelt should remain immersed in the solution for about two days.\r\nWhen taken out it must be first nearly dried and then the flesh side\r\nscraped and rubbed until soft with some dull steel instrument, such as\r\nan old blunt chisel. Care should be taken not to break the skin as it\r\nis very fragile in some places, especially on the belly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snare with carrot bait]\r\n\r\nThe land animals can be caught in snares or deadfalls. Very likely\r\nmost boys know of these, but I have illustrated them here in the forms\r\nwhich I think have served me best. Usually only the smaller animals are\r\ncaught in the snare, such as rabbits and squirrels. To bait for either\r\nof these corn or apple is commonly used, although onion makes a good\r\nscent bait to draw rabbits from afar. Besides these named nearly any\r\ngreen vegetable or fruit will answer very well. These animals being\r\nmaybe the least wary of them all are therefore very easy to catch. For\r\nan opossum green corn and a little raw meat is all that is necessary,\r\nwhile for a raccoon a crawfish may be added. This latter is considered\r\nthe best, and hardly ever fails to lure the raccoon. The skins of the\r\nraccoon and opossum bring about a dollar and a half, and half a dollar,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deadfall]\r\n\r\nRabbits and squirrels are caught as game, while raccoons together with\r\nopossum are considered eatable by most trappers. The up-to-date people\r\nwho order \"marsh rabbits\" at the most fashionable restaurants are\r\neating no other than muskrat. These they eat with a great relish under\r\nthe new name. I will add that it makes a great difference in eating\r\na muskrat whether you let your imagination get the best of you. Many\r\ntimes I have eaten muskrat with quite as much comfort as though I were\r\neating rabbit. Naturally the meat has a very strong taste which must be\r\nremoved before cooking, by soaking over night in salt water. Young fat\r\nwoodchucks are also frequently eaten.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to set down on paper just how and where to set the traps\r\nand it can only be learned from another trapper or by experience. The\r\nmost important thing is to observe closely and learn the habits of the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n                                                        STANLEY COVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nCURING AND TANNING SKINS\r\n\r\nThe boy trapper must know how to take the skins from the animals he\r\ntraps, and how to treat them to preserve their beauty and value. The\r\nskin should be taken off before it becomes tainted, and with greatest\r\ncare not to injure it. Some skins are exceedingly tender. Be careful\r\nto remove bits of fat or flesh; left to dry on the skin, these detract\r\nfrom its value.\r\n\r\nNo artificial dressing is needed to cure or dry a skin. The fresh skin\r\nshould be tacked to a smooth board or drawn over a stretcher, fur side\r\nin, so that the air can get at it freely. It should not be put in the\r\nsun, or rain, or artificial heat.\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly dry, the skin is ready for market or it may be tanned\r\nat home. A boy fortunate enough to obtain a valuable pelt like that of\r\nmarten, mink, or otter, will certainly want to try his hand at tanning.\r\nYou want first to be sure to use a mixture which will not injure the\r\nfur but will fix it more firmly in its place. Never put any dressing on\r\nthe fur itself. You also want the skin to be soft and pliable so that\r\nit can be made up into some form of garment. The following directions\r\nare adapted from \"The Tricks of Trapping\" by W. Hamilton Gibson, a\r\nreliable source of all trapping lore for American boys: \"After every\r\nparticle of loose flesh and fat is removed from the skin, it should be\r\nsoaked for a couple of hours in warm water. While waiting, prepare this\r\nmixture: Take equal parts of saltpetre, borax, and sulphate of soda.\r\nMix with enough water to make a thin batter. Paint the wet skin over\r\nthickly on the flesh side. Fold the skin flesh side in and lay in an\r\nairy place, for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\"On the following day prepare a second mixture consisting of two parts\r\nsal-soda, three parts borax, four parts castile soap. Melt these\r\ntogether over a slow fire. Apply this mixture in the same manner as the\r\nfirst, twenty-four hours later. Fold skin as before and leave another\r\ntwenty-four hours. Make a third mixture of equal parts of common salt\r\nand alum, dissolved in warm water and thickened with coarse flour to\r\nthe consistency of thin paste. Allow this to dry on, then stretch\r\nthe skin lightly and scrape off the hardened paste with the bowl of\r\na spoon. Sometimes a second or even a third treatment with the last\r\nmixture is required to make the skin absolutely pliable, after which\r\nit should be finished with sand-paper and pumice stone. A skin thus\r\ndressed should be soft as velvet. The alum and salt set the hair\r\nsecurely.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nFREE PRINTED MATTER. HOW TO GET IT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three principal sources of free printed matter on outdoor\r\nwork subjects. These are (1) the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. (2) State Agricultural Experiment Stations. (3) Commercial\r\nhouses who sell supplies for outdoor occupations.\r\n\r\n(1) The Farmers' Bulletins are the ones which will be most useful to\r\noutdoor workers. They are written in plain language and treat every\r\nsubject in a practical way. To get them, you should address a postal\r\ncard thus:\r\n\r\n  Secretary of Agriculture,\r\n        Washington,\r\n                  D. C.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the card write as follows:\r\n\r\n     Please send me the list of publications for free distribution sent\r\n     out by your department, and oblige,\r\n\r\nSign your name and address distinctly.\r\n\r\nIn a few days you will get a printed circular giving the numbers and\r\ntitles of all the Farmers' Bulletins and other free literature they\r\nhave. Choose the ones you want and address another postal card to the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture. Ask for the bulletins wanted by number and\r\ntitle both, to avoid mistakes.\r\n\r\nSome of the bulletins of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nare not for free distribution. They are too valuable. A charge is made\r\nto cover cost of printing. To get any bulletin mentioned in this list\r\n_with its price_, address a letter to Superintendent of Documents,\r\nWashington, D. C., and enclose the amount in money order or coin. Do\r\nnot send stamps.\r\n\r\n(2) To get the bulletins of your own State Experiment Station you have\r\nonly to address another postal card; this time to the Director of State\r\nExperiment Station, with the name of the post-office and state. If\r\nnot sure of the title and number of the bulletin you want, tell the\r\ndirector what phase of the subject you are interested in. For instance,\r\none experiment station issues several poultry bulletins. Do you want\r\nthe one on \"House Construction\" or the one on \"Feeding Pullets?\" The\r\nmore definite you are in your requests the more likely you are to get\r\nexactly what you need most.\r\n\r\nTo get the bulletins of another station than your own is not quite so\r\nsimple. They have no fund for distributing bulletins in other states.\r\nBut I have never failed to get them by asking for just the thing\r\nI need. It is well to offer to pay for these; the price is always\r\nsmall. Some of them are republished by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture and appear in their free list as Experiment Station Work,\r\nI, II, III, etc.\r\n\r\n(3) The booklets and catalogues sent out free by seedsmen and other\r\ncommercial houses are mines of information, condensed and well\r\narranged. You may be sure that the advice they give is good, too, as it\r\nis to their interest to have their patrons succeed. You can tell the\r\ndifference very quickly between the \"hot air\" of advertising matter and\r\nthe practical advice to beginners given in catalogues.\r\n\r\nI most earnestly advise every one of you who is engaged in a money\r\nmaking enterprise to subscribe for some good periodical. There are\r\ngood magazines devoted to many of the occupations, and some of the\r\ngeneral magazines have special departments which are full of up-to-date\r\nsuggestions which have not yet been put into books. The latest and\r\nbest word on your subject is none too good and may make a difference\r\nof dollars in or out of pocket. If you devise any new apparatus or\r\ndiscover any time or money saving methods, don't keep these things to\r\nyourself. Help the world along by writing to some magazine about it.\r\nThey are on the lookout for valuable novelties. The stories told by\r\nboys and girls in this volume have almost all appeared in a magazine\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTDOOR WORKER'S LIBRARY\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of useful books, magazines, and bulletins on\r\nall sorts of outdoor occupations, written by experts. They are here\r\narranged by subjects under eleven of the chapters of this book.\r\n\r\nN. B. Some of these books are expensive. Get them from your library\r\nif you can. The librarian will usually order a good book which is in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    United States Department of Agriculture:\r\n\r\n    Farmers' Bulletin No. 332.
