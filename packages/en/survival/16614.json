Many of them are studies contributed to\r\nScientific Reviews or delivered as popular lectures. Some are\r\nexpositions of views the scientific basis of which may be\r\nregarded as established. Others--the greater number--may be\r\ndescribed as attempting the solution of problems which cannot be\r\napproached by direct observation.\r\n\r\nThe essay on The Birth-time of the World is based on a lecture\r\ndelivered before the Royal Dublin Society. The subject has\r\nattracted much attention within recent years. The age of the\r\nEarth is, indeed, of primary importance in our conception of the\r\nlongevity of planetary systems. The essay deals with the\r\nevidence, derived from the investigation of purely terrestrial\r\nphenomena, as to the period which has elapsed since the ocean\r\ncondensed upon the Earth's surface. Dr. Decker's recent addition\r\nto the subject appeared too late for inclusion in it. He finds\r\nthat the movements (termed isostatic) which geologists recognise\r\nas taking place deep in the Earth's crust, indicate an age of the\r\nsame order of magnitude\r\n\r\nxi\r\n\r\nas that which is inferred from the statistics of denudative\r\nhistory.[1]\r\n\r\nThe subject of _Denudation_ naturally arises from the first essay.\r\nIn thinking over the method of finding the age of the ocean by\r\nthe accumulation of sodium therein, I perceived so long ago as\r\n1899, when my first paper was published, that this method\r\nafforded a means of ascertaining the grand total of denudative\r\nwork effected on the Earth's surface since the beginning of\r\ngeological time; the resulting knowledge in no way involving any\r\nassumption as to the duration of the period comprising the\r\ndenudative actions. This idea has been elaborated in various\r\npublications since then, both by myself and by others.\r\n\"Denudation,\" while including a survey of the subject generally,\r\nis mainly a popular account of this method and its results. It\r\ncloses with a reference to the fascinating problems presented by\r\nthe inner nature of sedimentation: a branch of science to which I\r\nendeavoured to contribute some years ago.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Genesis_ first brings in the subject of the geological\r\nintervention of radioactivity. There can, I believe, be no doubt\r\nas to the influence of transforming elements upon the\r\ndevelopments of the surface features of the Earth; and, if I am\r\nright, this source of thermal energy is mainly responsible for\r\nthat local accumulation of wrinkling which we term mountain\r\nchains. The\r\n\r\n[1] Bull. Geol. Soc. America, vol. xxvi, March 1915.\r\n\r\nxii\r\n\r\npaper on _Alpine Structure_ is a reprint from \"Radioactivity and\r\nGeology,\" which for the sake of completeness is here included. It\r\nis directed to the elucidation of a detail of mountain genesis: a\r\ndetail which enters into recent theories of Alpine development.\r\nThe weakness of the theory of the \"horst\" is manifest, however,\r\nin many of its other applications; if not, indeed, in all.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing essays on the physical influences affecting the\r\nsurface features of the Earth are accompanied by one entitled _The\r\nAbundance of Life._ This originated amidst the overwhelming\r\npresentation of life which confronts us in the Swiss Alps. The\r\nsubject is sufficiently inspiring. Can no fundamental reason be\r\ngiven for the urgency and aggressiveness of life? Vitality is an\r\never-extending phenomenon. It is plain that the great principles\r\nwhich have been enunciated in explanation of the origin of\r\nspecies do not really touch the problem. In the essay--which is an\r\nearly one (1890)--the explanation of the whole great matter is\r\nsought--and as I believe found--in the attitude of the organism\r\ntowards energy external to it; an attitude which results in its\r\nevasion of the retardative and dissipatory effects which prevail\r\nin lifeless dynamic systems of all kinds.\r\n\r\n_Other Minds than Ours_? attempts a solution of the vexed question\r\nof the origin of the Martian \"canals.\" The essay is an abridgment\r\nof two popular lectures on the subject. I had previously written\r\nan account of my views which carried the enquiry as far as it was\r\nin\r\n\r\nxiii\r\n\r\nmy power to go. This paper appeared in the \"Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Dublin Society, 1897.\" The theory put forward is a purely\r\nphysical one, and, if justified, the view that intelligent beings\r\nexist in Mars derives no support from his visible surface\r\nfeatures; but is, in fact, confronted with fresh difficulties.\r\n\r\n_Pleochroic Haloes_ is a popular exposition of an inconspicuous but\r\nvery beautiful phenomenon of the rocks. Minute darkened spheres--a\r\nmicroscopic detail--appear everywhere in certain of the rock\r\nminerals. What are they? The discoveries of recent radioactive\r\nresearch--chiefly due to Rutherford--give the answer. The\r\nmeasurements applied to the little objects render the explanation\r\nbeyond question. They turn out to be a quite extraordinary record\r\nof radioactive energy; a record accumulated since remote\r\ngeological times, and assuring us, indirectly, of the stability\r\nof the chemical elements in general since the beginning of the\r\nworld. This assurance is, without proof, often assumed in our\r\nviews on the geological history of the Globe.\r\n\r\nSkating is a discourse, with a recent addition supporting the\r\noriginal thesis. It is an illustration of a common experience--the\r\nexplanation of an unimportant action involving principles the\r\nmost influential considered as a part of Nature's resources.\r\n\r\nThe address on _The Latent Image_ deals with a subject which had\r\nbeen approached by various writers before the time of my essay;\r\nbut, so far as I know, an explanation\r\n\r\nxiv\r\n\r\nbased on the facts of photo-electricity had not been attempted.\r\nStudents of this subject will notice that the views expressed are\r\nsimilar to those subsequently put forward by Lenard and Saeland\r\nin explanation of phosphorescence. The whole matter is of more\r\npractical importance than appears at first sight, for the\r\nphotoelectric nature of the effects involved in the radiative\r\ntreatment of many cruel diseases seems to be beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with photo-electric science that I was led\r\nto take an interest in the application of radioactivity in\r\nmedicine. The lecture on _The Use of Radium in Medicine_ deals with\r\nthis subject. Towards the conclusion of this essay reference will\r\nbe found to a practical outcome of such studies which, by\r\nimproving on the methods, and facilitating the application, of\r\nradioactive treatment, has, in the hands of skilled medical men,\r\nalready resulted in the alleviation of suffering.\r\n\r\nLeaving out much which might well appear in a prefatory notice, a\r\nword should yet be added respecting the illustrations of scenery.\r\nThey are a small selection from a considerable number of\r\nphotographs taken during my summer wanderings in the Alps in\r\ncompany with Henry H. Dixon. An exception is Plate X, which is by\r\nthe late Dr. Edward Stapleton. From what has been said above, it\r\nwill be gathered that these illustrations are fitly included\r\namong pages which owe so much to Alpine inspiration. They\r\nillustrate the\r\n\r\nxv\r\n\r\nsubjects dealt with, and, it is to be hoped, they will in some\r\ncases recall to the reader scenes which have in past times\r\ninfluenced his thoughts in the same manner; scenes which in their\r\nendless perspective seem to reduce to their proper insignificance\r\nthe lesser things of life.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Mr. John Murray for kindly consenting to the\r\nreissue of the essay on _The Birth-time of the World_ from the\r\npages of _Science Progress_; to Messrs. Constable & Co. for leave\r\nto reprint _Pleochroic Haloes_ from _Bedrock_, and also to make some\r\nextracts from _Radioactivity and Geology_; and to the Council of\r\nthe Royal Dublin Society for permission to republish certain\r\npapers from the Proceedings of the Society.\r\n\r\n_Iveagh Geological Laboratory, Trinity College, Dublin._\r\n\r\nJuly, 1915.\r\n\r\nxvi\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH-TIME OF THE WORLD [1]\r\n\r\nLONG ago Lucretius wrote: \"For lack of power to solve the\r\nquestion troubles the mind with doubts, whether there was ever a\r\nbirth-time of the world and whether likewise there is to be any\r\nend.\" \"And if\" (he says in answer) \"there was no birth-time of\r\nearth and heaven and they have been from everlasting, why before\r\nthe Theban war and the destruction of Troy have not other poets\r\nas well sung other themes? Whither have so many deeds of men so\r\noften passed away, why live they nowhere embodied in lasting\r\nrecords of fame? The truth methinks is that the sum has but a\r\nrecent date, and the nature of the world is new and has but\r\nlately had its commencement.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThus spake Lucretius nearly 2,000 years ago. Since then we have\r\nattained another standpoint and found very different limitations.\r\nTo Lucretius the world commenced with man, and the answer he\r\nwould give to his questions was in accord with his philosophy: he\r\nwould date the birth-time of the world from the time when\r\n\r\n[1] A lecture delivered before the Royal Dublin Society, February\r\n6th, 1914. _Science Progress_, vol. ix., p. 37\r\n\r\n[2] _De Rerum Natura_, translated by H. A. J. Munro (Cambridge,\r\n1886).\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\npoets first sang upon the earth. Modern Science has along with\r\nthe theory that the Earth dated its beginning with the advent of\r\nman, swept utterly away this beautiful imagining. We can, indeed,\r\nfind no beginning of the world. We trace back events and come to\r\nbarriers which close our vista--barriers which, for all we know,\r\nmay for ever close it. They stand like the gates of ivory and of\r\nhorn; portals from which only dreams proceed; and Science cannot\r\nas yet say of this or that dream if it proceeds from the gate of\r\nhorn or from that of ivory.\r\n\r\nIn short, of the Earth's origin we have no certain knowledge; nor\r\ncan we assign any date to it. Possibly its formation was an event\r\nso gradual that the beginning was spread over immense periods. We\r\ncan only trace the history back to certain events which may with\r\nconsiderable certainty be regarded as ushering in our geological\r\nera.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our limitations, the date of the birth-time of\r\nour geological era is the most important date in Science. For in\r\ntaking into our minds the spacious history of the universe, the\r\nworld's age must play the part of time-unit upon which all our\r\nconceptions depend. If we date the geological history of the\r\nEarth by thousands of years, as did our forerunners, we must\r\nshape our ideas of planetary time accordingly; and the duration\r\nof our solar system, and of the heavens, becomes comparable with\r\nthat of the dynasties of ancient nations. If by millions of\r\nyears, the sun and stars are proportionately venerable. If by\r\nhundreds or thousands of millions of\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nyears the human mind must consent to correspondingly vast epochs\r\nfor the duration of material changes. The geological age plays\r\nthe same part in our views of the duration of the universe as the\r\nEarth's orbital radius does in our views of the immensity of\r\nspace. Lucretius knew nothing of our time-unit: his unit was the\r\nlife of a man. So also he knew nothing of our space-unit, and he\r\nmarvels that so small a body as the sun can shed so much, heat\r\nand light upon the Earth.\r\n\r\nA study of the rocks shows us that the world was not always what\r\nit now is and long has been. We live in an epoch of denudation.\r\nThe rains and frosts disintegrate the hills; and the rivers roll\r\nto the sea the finely divided particles into which they have been\r\nresolved; as well as the salts which have been leached from them.\r\nThe sediments collect near the coasts of the continents; the\r\ndissolved matter mingles with the general ocean. The geologist\r\nhas measured and mapped these deposits and traced them back into\r\nthe past, layer by layer. He finds them ever the same;\r\nsandstones, slates, limestones, etc. But one thing is not the\r\nsame. _Life_ grows ever less diversified in character as the\r\nsediments are traced downwards. Mammals and birds, reptiles,\r\namphibians, fishes, die out successively in the past; and barren\r\nsediments ultimately succeed, leaving the first beginnings of\r\nlife undecipherable. Beneath these barren sediments lie rocks\r\ncollectively differing in character from those above: mainly\r\nvolcanic or poured out from fissures in\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nthe early crust of the Earth. Sediments are scarce among these\r\nmaterials.[1]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that in this underlying floor of\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks we have reached those surface\r\nmaterials of the earth which existed before the long epoch of\r\nsedimentation began, and before the seas came into being. They\r\nformed the floor of a vaporised ocean upon which the waters\r\ncondensed here and there from the hot and heavy atmosphere. Such\r\nwere the probable conditions which preceded the birth-time of the\r\nocean and of our era of life and its evolution.\r\n\r\nIt is from this epoch we date our geological age. Our next\r\npurpose is to consider how long ago, measured in years, that\r\nbirth-time was.\r\n\r\nThat the geological age of the Earth is very great appears from\r\nwhat we have already reviewed. The sediments of the past are many\r\nmiles in collective thickness: yet the feeble silt of the rivers\r\nbuilt them all from base to summit. They have been uplifted from\r\nthe seas and piled into mountains by movements so slow that\r\nduring all the time man has been upon the Earth but little change\r\nwould have been visible. The mountains have again been worn down\r\ninto the ocean by denudation and again younger mountains built\r\nout of their redeposited materials. The contemplation of such\r\nvast events\r\n\r\n[1] For a description of these early rocks, see especially the\r\nmonograph of Van Hise and Leith on the pre-Cambrian Geology of\r\nNorth America (Bulletin 360, U.S. Geol. Survey).\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nprepares our minds to accept many scores of millions of years or\r\nhundreds of millions of years, if such be yielded by our\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE AS INFERRED FROM THE THICKNESS OF THE SEDIMENTS\r\n\r\nThe earliest recognised method of arriving at an estimate of the\r\nEarth's geological age is based upon the measurement of the\r\ncollective sediments of geological periods. The method has\r\nundergone much revision from time to time. Let us briefly review\r\nit on the latest data.\r\n\r\nThe method consists in measuring the depths of all the successive\r\nsedimentary deposits where these are best developed. We go all\r\nover the explored world, recognising the successive deposits by\r\ntheir fossils and by their stratigraphical relations, measuring\r\ntheir thickness and selecting as part of the data required those\r\nbeds which we believe to most completely represent each\r\nformation. The total of these measurements would tell us the age\r\nof the Earth if their tale was indeed complete, and if we knew\r\nthe average rate at which they have been deposited. We soon,\r\nhowever, find difficulties in arriving at the quantities we\r\nrequire. Thus it is not easy to measure the real thickness of a\r\ndeposit. It may be folded back upon itself, and so we may measure\r\nit twice over. We may exaggerate its thickness by measuring it\r\nnot quite straight across the bedding or by unwittingly including\r\nvolcanic materials. On the other hand, there\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nmay be deposits which are inaccessible to us; or, again, an\r\nentire absence of deposits; either because not laid down in the\r\nareas we examine, or, if laid down, again washed into the sea.\r\nThese sources of error in part neutralise one another. Some make\r\nour resulting age too long, others make it out too short. But we\r\ndo not know if a balance of error does not still remain. Here,\r\nhowever, is a table of deposits which summarises a great deal of\r\nour knowledge of the thickness of the stratigraphical\r\naccumulations. It is due to Sollas.[1]\r\n\r\nFeet.\r\n\r\nRecent and Pleistocene  - -    4,000\r\nPliocene                 - -   13,000\r\nMiocene                  - -   14,000\r\nOligocene                - -     2,000\r\nEocene                   - -  20,000\r\n                              63,000\r\n\r\nUpper Cretaceous        - -   24,000\r\nLower Cretaceous        - -   20,000\r\nJurassic                 - -    8,000\r\nTrias                    - -   7,000\r\n                              69,000\r\n\r\nPermian                  - -    2,000\r\nCarboniferous           - -    29,000\r\nDevonian                 - -   22,000\r\n                              63,000\r\n\r\nSilurian                 - -   15,000\r\nOrdovician              - -   17,000\r\nCambrian                 - -   6,000\r\n                              58,000\r\n\r\nAlgonkian--Keeweenawan   - -   50,000\r\nAlgonkian--Animikian     - -   14,000\r\nAlgonkian--Huronian      - -   18,000\r\n                              82,000\r\n\r\nArchæan                   - -   ?\r\n\r\nTotal                     - - 335,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[1] Address to the Geol. Soc. of London, 1509.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nIn the next place we require to know the average rate at which\r\nthese rocks were laid down. This is really the weakest link in\r\nthe chain. The most diverse results have been arrived at, which\r\nspace does not permit us to consider. The value required is most\r\ndifficult to determine, for it is different for the different\r\nclasses of material, and varies from river to river according to\r\nthe conditions of discharge to the sea. We may probably take it\r\nas between two and six inches in a century.\r\n\r\nNow the total depth of the sediments as we see is about 335,000\r\nfeet (or 64 miles), and if we take the rate of collecting as\r\nthree inches in a hundred years we get the time for all to\r\ncollect as 134 millions of years. If the rate be four inches, the\r\ntime is soo millions of years, which is the figure Geikie\r\nfavoured, although his result was based on somewhat different\r\ndata. Sollas most recently finds 80 millions of years.[1]\r\n\r\nTHE AGE AS INFERRED FROM THE MASS OF THE SEDIMENTS\r\n\r\nIn the above method we obtain our result by the measurement of\r\nthe linear dimensions of the sediments. These measurements, as we\r\nhave seen, are difficult to arrive at. We may, however, proceed\r\nby measurements of the mass of the sediments, and then the method\r\nbecomes more definite. The new method is pursued as follows:\r\n\r\n[1] Geikie, _Text Book of Geology_ (Macmillan, 1903), vol. i., p.\r\n73, _et seq._ Sollas, _loc. cit._ Joly, _Radioactivity and Geology_\r\n(Constable, 1909), and Phil. Mag., Sept. 1911.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe total mass of the sediments formed since denudation began may\r\nbe ascertained with comparative accuracy by a study of the\r\nchemical composition of the waters of the ocean. The salts in the\r\nocean are undoubtedly derived from the rocks; increasing age by\r\nage as the latter are degraded from their original character\r\nunder the action of the weather, etc., and converted to the\r\nsedimentary form. By comparing the average chemical composition\r\nof these two classes of material--the primary or igneous rocks and\r\nthe sedimentary--it is easy to arrive at a knowledge of how much\r\nof this or that constituent was given to the ocean by each ton of\r\nprimary rock which was denuded to the sedimentary form. This,\r\nhowever, will not assist us to our object unless the ocean has\r\nretained the salts shed into it. It has not generally done so. In\r\nthe case of every substance but one the ocean continually gives\r\nup again more or less of the salts supplied to it by the rivers.\r\nThe one exception is the element sodium. The great solubility of\r\nits salts has protected it from abstraction, and it has gone on\r\ncollecting during geological time, practically in its entirety.\r\nThis gives us the clue to the denudative history of the\r\nEarth.[1]\r\n\r\nThe process is now simple. We estimate by chemical examination of\r\nigneous and sedimentary rocks the amount of sodium which has been\r\nsupplied to the ocean per ton of sediment produced by denudation.\r\nWe also calculate\r\n\r\n[1] _Trans. R.D.S._, May, 1899.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nthe amount of sodium contained in the ocean. We divide the one\r\ninto the other (stated, of course, in the same units of mass),\r\nand the quotient gives us the number of tons of sediment. The\r\nmost recent estimate of the sediments made in this manner affords\r\n56 x 1016 tonnes.[1]\r\n\r\nNow we are assured that all this sediment was transported by the\r\nrivers to the sea during geological time. Thus it follows that,\r\nif we can estimate the average annual rate of the river supply of\r\nsediments to the ocean over the past, we can calculate the\r\nrequired age. The land surface is at present largely covered with\r\nthe sedimentary rocks themselves. Sediment derived from these\r\nrocks must be regarded as, for the most part, purely cyclical;\r\nthat is, circulating from the sea to the land and back again. It\r\ndoes not go to increase the great body of detrital deposits. We\r\ncannot, therefore, take the present river supply of sediment as\r\nrepresenting that obtaining over the long past. If the land was\r\nall covered still with primary rocks we might do so. It has been\r\nestimated that about 25 per cent. of the existing continental\r\narea is covered with archæan and igneous rocks, the remainder\r\nbeing sediments.[2] On this estimate we may find valuable\r\n\r\n[1] Clarke, _A Preliminary Study of Chemical Denudation_\r\n(Washington, 1910). My own estimate in 1899 (_loc. cit._) made as a\r\ntest of yet another method of finding the age, showed that the\r\nsediments may be taken as sufficient to form a layer 1.1 mile\r\ndeep if spread uniformly over the continents; and would amount to\r\n64 x 1018 tons.\r\n\r\n[2] Van Tillo, _Comptes Rendues_ (Paris), vol. cxiv., 1892.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nmajor and minor limits to the geological age. If we take 25 per\r\ncent. only of the present river supply of sediment, we evidently\r\nfix a major limit to the age, for it is certain that over the\r\npast there must have been on the average a faster supply. If we\r\ntake the entire river supply, on similar reasoning we have what\r\nis undoubtedly a minor limit to the age.\r\n\r\nThe river supply of detrital sediment has not been very\r\nextensively investigated, although the quantities involved may be\r\nfound with comparative ease and accuracy. The following table\r\nembodies the results obtained for some of the leading rivers.[1]\r\n\r\n               Mean annual   Total annual   Ratio of\r\n               discharge in  sediment in    sediment\r\n               cubic feet    thousands      to water\r\n               per second.   of tons.       by weight.\r\n\r\nPotomac -        20,160          5,557        1 : 3.575\r\nMississippi -   610,000       406,250        1 : 1,500\r\nRio Grande -      1,700          3,830        1 : 291\r\nUruguay -       150,000         14,782       1 : 10,000\r\nRhone -          65,850         36,000       1 : 1,775\r\nPo -             62,200         67,000       1 : 900\r\nDanube -        315,200        108,000       1 : 2,880\r\nNile -          113,000         54,000       1 : 2,050\r\nIrrawaddy -     475,000       291,430        1 : 1,610\r\n\r\nMean -          201,468        109,650       1 : 2,731\r\n\r\nWe see that the ratio of the weight of water to the\r\n\r\n[1] Russell, _River Development_ (John Murray, 1888).\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nweight of transported sediment in six out of the nine rivers does\r\nnot vary widely. The mean is 2,730 to 1. But this is not the\r\nrequired average. The water-discharge of each river has to be\r\ntaken into account. If we ascribe to the ratio given for each\r\nriver the weight proper to the amount of water it discharges, the\r\nproportion of weight of water to weight of sediment, for the\r\nwhole quantity of water involved, comes out as 2,520 to 1.\r\n\r\nNow if this proportion holds for all the rivers of the\r\nworld--which collectively discharge about 27 x 1012 tonnes of\r\nwater per annum--the river-born detritus is 1.07 x 1010 tonnes. To\r\nthis an addition of 11 per cent. has to be made for silt pushed\r\nalong the river-bed.[1] On these figures the minor limit to the\r\nage comes out as 47 millions of years, and the major limit as 188\r\nmillions. We are here going on rather deficient estimates, the\r\nrivers involved representing only some 6 per cent. of the total\r\nriver supply of water to the ocean. But the result is probably\r\nnot very far out.\r\n\r\nWe may arrive at a probable age lying between the major and minor\r\nlimits. If, first, we take the arithmetic mean of these limits,\r\nwe get 117 millions of years. Now this is almost certainly\r\nexcessive, for we here assume that the rate of covering of the\r\nprimary rocks by sediments was uniform. It would not be so,\r\nhowever, for the rate of supply of original sediment must have\r\nbeen continually diminishing\r\n\r\n[1] According to observations made on the Mississippi (Russell,\r\n_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nduring geological time, and hence we may assume that the rate of\r\nadvance of the sediments on the primary rocks has also been\r\ndiminishing. Now we may probably take, as a fair assumption, that\r\nthe sediment-covered area was at any instant increasing at a rate\r\nproportionate to the rate of supply of sediment; that is, to the\r\narea of primary rocks then exposed. On this assumption the age is\r\nfound to be 87 millions of years.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE BY THE SODIUM OF THE OCEAN\r\n\r\nI have next to lay before you a quite different method. I have\r\nalready touched upon the chemistry of the ocean, and on the\r\nremarkable fact that the sodium contained in it has been\r\npreserved, practically, in its entirety from the beginning of\r\ngeological time.\r\n\r\nThat the sea is one of the most beautiful and magnificent sights\r\nin Nature, all admit. But, I think, to those who know its story\r\nits beauty and magnificence are ten-fold increased. Its saltness\r\nit due to no magic mill. It is the dissolved rocks of the Earth\r\nwhich give it at once its brine, its strength, and its buoyancy.\r\nThe rivers which we say flow with \"fresh\" water to the sea\r\nnevertheless contain those traces of salt which, collected over\r\nthe long ages, occasion the saltness of the ocean. Each gallon of\r\nriver water contributes to the final result; and this has been\r\ngoing on since the beginning of our era. The mighty total of the\r\nrivers is 6,500 cubic miles of water in the year!\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the primeval ocean was in the\r\ncondition of a fresh-water lake. It can be shown that a primitive\r\nand more rapid solution of the original crust of the Earth by the\r\nslowly cooling ocean would have given rise to relatively small\r\nsalinity. The fact is, the quantity of salts in the ocean is\r\nenormous. We are only now concerned with the sodium; but if we\r\ncould extract all the rock-salt (the chloride of sodium) from the\r\nocean we should have enough to cover the entire dry land of the\r\nEarth to a depth of 400 feet. It is this gigantic quantity which\r\nis going to enter into our estimate of the Earth's age. The\r\ncalculated mass of sodium contained in this rock-salt is 14,130\r\nmillion million tonnes.\r\n\r\nIf now we can determine the rate at which the rivers supply\r\nsodium to the ocean, we can determine the age.[1] As the result\r\nof many thousands of river analyses, the total amount of sodium\r\nannually discharged to the ocean\r\n\r\n[1] _Trans. R.D.S._, 1899. A paper by Edmund Halley, the\r\nastronomer, in the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety_ for 1715, contains a suggestion for finding the age of\r\nthe world by the following procedure. He proposes to make\r\nobservations on the saltness of the seas and ocean at intervals\r\nof one or more centuries, and from the increment of saltness\r\narrive at their age. The measurements, as a matter of fact, are\r\nimpracticable. The salinity would only gain (if all remained in\r\nsolution) one millionth part in Too years; and, of course, the\r\ncontinuous rejection of salts by the ocean would invalidate the\r\nmethod. The last objection also invalidates the calculation by T.\r\nMellard Reade (_Proc. Liverpool Geol. Soc._, 1876) of a minor limit\r\nto the age by the calcium sulphate in the ocean. Both papers were\r\nquite unknown to me when working out my method. Halley's paper\r\nwas, I think, only brought to light in 1908.\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nby all the rivers of the world is found to be probably not far\r\nfrom 175 million tonnes.[1] Dividing this into the mass of\r\noceanic sodium we get the age as 80.7 millions of years. Certain\r\ncorrections have to be applied to this figure which result in\r\nraising it to a little over 90 millions of years. Sollas, as the\r\nresult of a careful review of the data, gets the age as between\r\n80 and 150 millions of years. My own result[2] was between 80 and\r\n90 millions of years; but I subsequently found that upon certain\r\nextreme assumptions a maximum age might be arrived at of 105\r\nmillions of years.[3] Clarke regards the 80.7 millions of years\r\nas certainly a maximum in the light of certain calculations by\r\nBecker.[4]\r\n\r\nThe order of magnitude of these results cannot be shaken unless\r\non the assumption that there is something entirely misleading in\r\nthe existing rate of solvent denudation. On the strength of the\r\nresults of another and\r\n\r\n[1] F. W. Clarke, _A Preliminary Study of Chemical Denudation_\r\n(Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 1910).\r\n\r\n[2] _Loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[3] \"The Circulation of Salt and Geological Time\" (Geol. Mag.,\r\n1901, p. 350).\r\n\r\n[4] Becker (loc. cit.), assuming that the exposed igneous and\r\narchæan rocks alone are responsible for the supply of sodium to\r\nthe ocean, arrives at 74 millions of years as the geological age.\r\nThis matter was discussed by me formerly (Trans. R.D.S., 1899,\r\npp. 54 _et seq._). The assumption made is, I believe, inadmissible.\r\nIt is not supported by river analyses, or by the chemical\r\ncharacter of residual soils from sedimentary rocks. There may be\r\nsome convergence in the rate of solvent denudation, but--as I\r\nthink on the evidence--in our time unimportant.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nentirely different method of approaching the question of the\r\nEarth's age (which shall be presently referred to), it has been\r\ncontended that it is too low. It is even asserted that it is from\r\nnine to fourteen times too low. We have then to consider whether\r\nsuch an enormous error can enter into the method. The\r\nmeasurements involved cannot be seriously impugned. Corrections\r\nfor possible errors applied to the quantities entering into this\r\nmethod have been considered by various writers. My own original\r\ncorrections have been generally confirmed. I think the only point\r\nleft open for discussion is the principle of uniformitarianism\r\ninvolved in this method and in the methods previously discussed.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the force of the evidence for uniformity\r\nin the geological history of the Earth, it is, of course,\r\nnecessary to possess some acquaintance with geological science.\r\nSome of the most eminent geologists, among whom Lyell and\r\nGeikie[1] may be mentioned, have upheld the doctrine of\r\nuniformity. It must here suffice to dwell upon a few points\r\nhaving special reference to the matter under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe mere extent of the land surface does not, within limits,\r\naffect the question of the rate of denudation. This arises from\r\nthe fact that the rain supply is quite insufficient to denude the\r\nwhole existing land surface. About 30 per cent. of it does not,\r\nin fact, drain to the\r\n\r\n[1] See especially Geikie's Address to Sect. C., Brit. Assoc.\r\nRep., 1399.\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nocean. If the continents become invaded by a great transgression\r\nof the ocean, this \"rainless\" area diminishes: and the denuded\r\narea advances inwards without diminution. If the ocean recedes\r\nfrom the present strand lines, the \"rainless\" area advances\r\noutwards, but, the rain supply being sensibly constant, no change\r\nin the river supply of salts is to be expected.\r\n\r\nAge-long submergence of the entire land, or of any very large\r\nproportion of what now exists, is negatived by the continuous\r\nsequence of vast areas of sediment in every geologic age from the\r\nearliest times. Now sediment-receiving areas always are but a\r\nsmall fraction of those exposed areas whence the sediments are\r\nsupplied.[1] Hence in the continuous records of the sediments we\r\nhave assurance of the continuous exposure of the continents above\r\nthe ocean surface. The doctrine of the permanency of the\r\ncontinents has in its main features been accepted by the most\r\neminent authorities. As to the actual amount of land which was\r\nexposed during past times to denudative effects, no data exist to\r\nshow it was very different from what is now exposed. It has been\r\nestimated that the average area of the North American continent\r\nover geologic time was about eight-tenths of its existing\r\narea.[2] Restorations of other continents, so far as they have\r\nbeen attempted, would not\r\n\r\n[1] On the strength of the Mississippi measurements about 1 to 18\r\n(Magee, _Am.

The second column of the table gives\r\nthe mean heights in metres above sea level of the several\r\ncontinents, as cited by Arrhenius.[2]\r\n\r\nOf all the denudation results given in the table, those relating\r\nto North America and to Europe are far the\r\n\r\n[1] See also Poulton, Address to Sect. D., Brit. Assoc. Rep.,\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n[2] _Lehybuch dev Kosmischen Physik_, vol. i., p. 347.\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nmost reliable. Indeed these may be described as highly reliable,\r\nbeing founded on some thousands of analyses, many of which have\r\nbeen systematically pursued through every season of the year.\r\nThese show that Europe with a mean altitude of less than half\r\nthat of North America sheds to the ocean 25 per cent. more salts.\r\nA result which is to be expected when the more important factors\r\nof solvent denudation are given intelligent consideration and we\r\ndiscriminate between conditions favouring solvent and detrital\r\ndenudation respectively: conditions in many cases\r\nantagonistic.[1] Hence if it is true, as has been stated, that we\r\nnow live in a period of exceptionally high continental elevation,\r\nwe must infer that the average supply of salts to the ocean by\r\nthe rivers of the world is less than over the long past, and\r\nthat, therefore, our estimate of the age of the Earth as already\r\ngiven is excessive.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one condition which will operate to unduly\r\ndiminish our estimate of geologic time, and it is a condition\r\nwhich may possibly obtain at the present time. If the land is, on\r\nthe whole, now sinking relatively to the ocean level, the\r\ndenudation area tends, as we have seen, to move inwards. It will\r\nthus encroach upon regions which have not for long periods\r\ndrained to the ocean. On such areas there is an accumulation of\r\nsoluble salts which the deficient rivers have not been able to\r\ncarry to the ocean. Thus the salt content of certain of\r\n\r\n[1] See the essay on Denudation.\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nthe rivers draining to the ocean will be influenced not only by\r\npresent denudative effects, but also by the stored results of\r\npast effects. Certain rivers appear to reveal this unduly\r\nincreased salt supply those which flow through comparatively arid\r\nareas. However, the flowoff of such tributaries is relatively\r\nsmall and the final effects on the great rivers apparently\r\nunimportant--a result which might have been anticipated when the\r\nextremely slow rate of the land movements is taken into account.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of effecting any reconciliation of the methods\r\nalready described and that now to be given increases the interest\r\nboth of the former and the latter.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE BY RADIOACTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS\r\n\r\nRutherford suggested in 1905 that as helium was continually being\r\nevolved at a uniform rate by radioactive substances (in the form\r\nof the alpha rays) a determination of the age of minerals\r\ncontaining the radioactive elements might be made by measurements\r\nof the amount of the stored helium and of the radioactive\r\nelements giving rise to it, The parent radioactive substances\r\nare--according to present knowledge--uranium and thorium. An\r\nestimate of the amounts of these elements present enables the\r\nrate of production of the helium to be calculated. Rutherford\r\nshortly afterwards found by this method an age of 240 millions of\r\nyears for a radioactive mineral of presumably remote age. Strutt,\r\nwho carried\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nhis measurements to a wonderful degree of refinement, found the\r\nfollowing ages for mineral substances originating in different\r\ngeological ages:\r\n\r\nOligocene -               8.4 millions of years.\r\nEocene -                 31    millions of years.\r\nLower Carboniferous -  150   millions of years.\r\nArchæan -               750    millions of years.\r\n\r\nPeriods of time much less than, and very inconsistent with, these\r\nwere also found. The lower results are, however, easily explained\r\nif we assume that the helium--which is a gas under prevailing\r\nconditions--escapes in many cases slowly from the mineral.\r\n\r\nAnother product of radioactive origin is lead. The suggestion\r\nthat this substance might be made available to determine the age\r\nof the Earth also originated with Rutherford. We are at least\r\nassured that this element cannot escape by gaseous diffusion from\r\nthe minerals. Boltwood's results on the amount of lead contained\r\nin minerals of various ages, taken in conjunction with the amount\r\nof uranium or parent substance present, afforded ages rising to\r\n1,640 millions of years for archæan and 1,200 millions for\r\nAlgonkian time. Becker, applying the same method, obtained\r\nresults rising to quite incredible periods: from 1,671 to 11,470\r\nmillions of years. Becker maintained that original lead rendered\r\nthe determinations indefinite. The more recent results of Mr. A.\r\nHolmes support the conclusion that \"original\" lead may be present\r\nand may completely falsify results derived\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nfrom minerals of low radioactivity in which the derived lead\r\nwould be small in amount. By rejecting such results as appeared\r\nto be of this character, he arrives at 370 millions of years as\r\nthe age of the Devonian.\r\n\r\nI must now describe a very recent method of estimating the age of\r\nthe Earth. There are, in certain rock-forming minerals,\r\ncolour-changes set up by radioactive causes. The minute and\r\ncurious marks so produced are known as haloes; for they surround,\r\nin ringlike forms, minute particles of included substances which\r\ncontain radioactive elements. It is now well known how these\r\nhaloes are formed. The particle in the centre of the halo\r\ncontains uranium or thorium, and, necessarily, along with the\r\nparent substance, the various elements derived from it. In the\r\nprocess of transformation giving rise to these several derived\r\nsubstances, atoms of helium--the alpha rays--projected with great\r\nvelocity into the surrounding mineral, occasion the colour\r\nchanges referred to. These changes are limited to the distance to\r\nwhich the alpha rays penetrate; hence the halo is a spherical\r\nvolume surrounding the central substance.[1]\r\n\r\nThe time required to form a halo could be found if on the one\r\nhand we could ascertain the number of alpha rays ejected from the\r\nnucleus of the halo in, say, one year, and, on the other, if we\r\ndetermined by experiment just how many alpha rays were required\r\nto produce the same\r\n\r\n[1] _Phil. Mag._, March, 1907 and February, 1910; also _Bedrock_,\r\nJanuary, 1913. See _Pleochroic Haloes_ in this volume.\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\namount of colour alteration as we perceive to extend around the\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\nThe latter estimate is fairly easily and surely made. But to know\r\nthe number of rays leaving the central particle in unit time we\r\nrequire to know the quantity of radioactive material in the\r\nnucleus. This cannot be directly determined. We can only, from\r\nknown results obtained with larger specimens of just such a\r\nmineral substance as composes the nucleus, guess at the amount of\r\nuranium, or it may be thorium, which may be present.\r\n\r\nThis method has been applied to the uranium haloes of the mica of\r\nCounty Carlow.[1] Results for the age of the halo of from 20 to\r\n400 millions of years have been obtained. This mica was probably\r\nformed in the granite of Leinster in late Silurian or in Devonian\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe higher results are probably the least in error, upon the data\r\ninvolved; for the assumption made as to the amount of uranium in\r\nthe nuclei of the haloes was such as to render the higher results\r\nthe more reliable.\r\n\r\nThis method is, of course, a radioactive method, and similar to\r\nthe method by helium storage, save that it is free of the risk of\r\nerror by escape of the helium, the effects of which are, as it\r\nwere, registered at the moment of its production, so that its\r\nsubsequent escape is of no moment.\r\n\r\n[1] Joly and Rutherford, _Phil. Mag._, April, 1913.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE RESULTS\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly review the results on the geological age of\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nBy methods based on the approximate uniformity of denudative\r\neffects in the past, a period of the order of 100 millions of\r\nyears has been obtained as the duration of our geological age;\r\nand consistently whether we accept for measurement the sediments\r\nor the dissolved sodium. We can give reasons why these\r\nmeasurements might afford too great an age, but we can find\r\nabsolutely no good reason why they should give one much too low.\r\n\r\nBy measuring radioactive products ages have been found which,\r\nwhile they vary widely among themselves, yet claim to possess\r\naccuracy in their superior limits, and exceed those derived from\r\ndenudation from nine to fourteen times.\r\n\r\nIn this difficulty let us consider the claims of the radioactive\r\nmethod in any of its forms. In order to be trustworthy it must be\r\ntrue; (1) that the rate of transformation now shown by the parent\r\nsubstance has obtained throughout the entire past, and (2) that\r\nthere were no other radioactive substances, either now or\r\nformerly existing, except uranium, which gave rise to lead. As\r\nregards methods based on the production of helium, what we have\r\nto say will largely apply to it also. If some unknown source of\r\nthese elements exists we, of course, on our assumption\r\noverestimate the age.\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nAs regards the first point: In ascribing a constant rate of\r\nchange to the parent substance--which Becker (loc. cit.) describes\r\nas \"a simple though tremendous extrapolation\"--we reason upon\r\nanalogy with the constant rate of decay observed in the derived\r\nradioactive bodies. If uranium and thorium are really primary\r\nelements, however, the analogy relied on may be misleading; at\r\nleast, it is obviously incomplete. It is incomplete in a\r\nparticular which may be very important: the mode of origin of\r\nthese parent bodies--whatever it may have been--is different to\r\nthat of the secondary elements with which we compare them. A\r\nconvergence in their rate of transformation is not impossible, or\r\neven improbable, so far as we known.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second point: It is assumed that uranium alone of\r\nthe elements in radioactive minerals is ultimately transformed to\r\nlead by radioactive changes. We must consider this assumption.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in the chemistry of the radioactive elements has\r\nbrought out evidence that all three lines of radioactive descent\r\nknown to us--_i.e._ those beginning with uranium, with thorium,\r\nand with actinium--alike converge to lead.[1] There are\r\ndifficulties in the way of believing that all the lead-like atoms\r\nso produced (\"isotopes\" of lead, as Soddy proposes to call them)\r\nactually remain as stable lead in the minerals. For one\r\n\r\n[1] See Soddy's _Chemistry of the Radioactive Elements_ (Longmans,\r\nGreen & Co.).\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nthing there is sometimes, along with very large amounts of\r\nthorium, an almost entire absence of lead in thorianites and\r\nthorites. And in some urano--thorites the lead may be noticed to\r\nfollow the uranium in approximate proportionality,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of large amounts of thorium.[1] This\r\nis in favour of the assumption that all the lead present is\r\nderived from the uranium. The actinium is present in negligibly\r\nsmall amounts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is evidence arising from the atomic\r\nweight of lead which seems to involve some other parent than\r\nuranium. Soddy, in the work referred to, points this out. The\r\natomic weight of radium is well known, and uranium in its descent\r\nhas to change to this element. The loss of mass between radium\r\nand uranium-derived lead can be accurately estimated by the\r\nnumber of alpha rays given off. From this we get the atomic\r\nweight of uranium-derived lead as closely 206. Now the best\r\ndeterminations of the atomic weight of normal lead assign to this\r\nelement an atomic weight of closely\r\n\r\n[1] It seems very difficult at present to suggest an end product\r\nfor thorium, unless we assume that, by loss of electrons, thorium\r\nE, or thorium-lead, reverts to a substance chemically identical\r\nwith thorium itself. Such a change--whether considered from the\r\npoint of view of the periodic law or of the radioactive theory\r\nwould involve many interesting consequences. It is, of course,\r\nquite possible that the nature of the conditions attending the\r\ndeposition of the uranium ores, many of which are comparatively\r\nrecent, are responsible for the difficulties observed. The\r\nthorium and uranium ores are, again, specially prone to\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\n207. By a somewhat similar calculation it is deduced that\r\nthorium-derived lead would possess the atomic weight of 208. Thus\r\nnormal lead might be an admixture of uranium- and thorium-derived\r\nlead. However, as we have seen, the view that thorium gives rise\r\nto stable lead is beset with some difficulties.\r\n\r\nIf we are going upon reliable facts and figures, we must, then,\r\nassume: (a) That some other element than uranium, and genetically\r\nconnected with it (probably as parent substance), gives rise, or\r\nformerly gave rise, to lead of heavier atomic weight than normal\r\nlead. It may be observed respecting this theory that there is\r\nsome support for the view that a parent substance both to uranium\r\nand thorium has existed or possibly exists. The evidence is found\r\nin the proportionality frequently observed between the amounts of\r\nthorium and uranium in the primary rocks.[1] Or: (b) We may meet\r\nthe difficulties in a simpler way, which may be stated as\r\nfollows: If we assume that all stable lead is derived from\r\nuranium, and at the same time recognise that lead is not\r\nperfectly homogeneous in atomic weight, we must, of necessity,\r\nascribe to uranium a similar want of homogeneity; heavy atoms of\r\nuranium giving rise to heavy\r\n\r\n[1] Compare results for the thorium content of such rocks\r\n(appearing in a paper by the author Cong. Int. _de Radiologie et\r\nd'Electricité_, vol. i., 1910, p. 373), and those for the radium\r\ncontent, as collected in _Phil. Mag._, October, 1912, p. 697.\r\nAlso A. L. Fletcher, _Phil. Mag._, July, 1910; January, 1911, and\r\nJune, 1911. J. H. J. Poole, _Phil. Mag._, April, 1915\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\natoms of lead and light atoms of uranium generating light atoms\r\nof lead. This assumption seems to be involved in the figures\r\nupon, which we are going. Still relying on these figures, we\r\nfind, however, that existing uranium cannot give rise to lead of\r\nnormal atomic weight. We can only conclude that the heavier atoms\r\nof uranium have decayed more rapidly than the lighter ones. In\r\nthis connection it is of interest to note the complexity of\r\nuranium as recently established by Geiger, although in this case\r\nit is assumed that the shorter-lived isotope bears the relation\r\nof offspring to the longer-lived and largely preponderating\r\nconstituent. However, there does not seem to be any direct proof\r\nof this as yet.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it would seem that unless the atomic\r\nweight of lead in uraninites, etc., is 206, the former complexity\r\nand more accelerated decay of uranium are indicated in the data\r\nrespecting the atomic weights of radium and lead[1]. As an\r\nalternative view, we may assume, as in our first hypothesis, that\r\nsome elementally different but genetically connected substance,\r\ndecaying along branching lines of descent at a rate sufficient to\r\npractically remove the whole of it during geological time,\r\nformerly existed. Whichever hypothesis we adopt\r\n\r\n[1] Later investigation has shown that the atomic weight of lead\r\nin uranium-bearing ores is about 206.6 (see Richards and Lembert,\r\n_Journ. of Am. Claem. Soc._, July, 1914). This result gives support\r\nto the view expressed above.\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nwe are confronted by probabilities which invalidate\r\ntime-measurements based on the lead and helium ratio in minerals.\r\nWe have, in short, grave reason to question the measure of\r\nuniformitarianism postulated in finding the age by any of the\r\nknown radioactive methods.\r\n\r\nThat we have much to learn respecting our assumptions, whether we\r\npursue the geological or the radioactive methods of approaching\r\nthe age of our era, is, indeed, probable. Whatever the issue it\r\nis certain that the reconciling facts will leave us with much\r\nmore light than we at present possess either as respects the\r\nEarth's history or the history of the radioactive elements. With\r\nthis necessary admission we leave our study of the Birth-Time of\r\nthe World.\r\n\r\nIt has led us a long way from Lucretius. We do not ask if other\r\nIliads have perished; or if poets before Homer have vainly sung,\r\nbecoming a prey to all-consuming time. We move in a greater\r\nhistory, the landmarks of which are not the birth and death of\r\nkings and poets, but of species, genera, orders. And we set out\r\nthese organic events not according to the passing generations of\r\nman, but over scores or hundreds of millions of years.\r\n\r\nHow much Lucretius has lost, and how much we have gained, is\r\nbound up with the question of the intrinsic value of knowledge\r\nand great ideas. Let us appraise knowledge as we would the\r\nHomeric poems, as some-\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nthing which ennobles life and makes it happier. Well, then, we\r\nare, as I think, in possession today of some of those lost Iliads\r\nand Odysseys for which Lucretius looked in vain.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The duration in the past of Solar heat is necessarily bound\r\nup with the geological age. There is no known means (outside\r\nspeculative science) of accounting for more than about 30 million\r\nyears of the existing solar temperature in the past. In this\r\ndirection the age seems certainly limited to 100 million years.\r\nSee a review of the question by Dr. Lindemann in Nature, April\r\n5th, 1915.\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nDENUDATION\r\n\r\nTHE subject of denudation is at once one of the most interesting\r\nand one of the most complicated with which the geologist has to\r\ndeal. While its great results are apparent even to the most\r\ncasual observer, the factors which have led to these results are\r\nin many cases so indeterminate, and in some cases apparently so\r\nvariable in influence, that thoughtful writers have even claimed\r\nprecisely opposite effects as originating from, the same cause.\r\nIndeed, it is almost impossible to deal with the subject without\r\nentering upon controversial matters. In the following pages I\r\nshall endeavour to keep to broad issues which are, at the present\r\nday, either conceded by the greater number of authorities on the\r\nsubject, or are, from their strictly quantitative character, not\r\nopen to controversy.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, in the first place, that denudation--or the wearing\r\naway of the land surfaces of the earth--is mainly a result of the\r\ncirculation of water from the ocean to the land, and back again\r\nto the ocean. An action entirely conditioned by solar heat, and\r\nwithout which it would completely cease and further change upon\r\nthe land come to an end.\r\n\r\nTo what actions, then, is so great a potency of the\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\ncirculating water to be traced? Broadly speaking, we may classify\r\nthem as mechanical and chemical. The first involves the\r\nseparation of rock masses into smaller fragments of all sizes,\r\ndown to the finest dust. The second involves the actual solution\r\nin the water of the rock constituents, which may be regarded as\r\nthe final act of disintegration. The rivers bear the burden both\r\nof the comminuted and the dissolved materials to the sea. The mud\r\nand sand carried by their currents, or gradually pushed along\r\ntheir beds, represent the former; the invisible dissolved matter,\r\nonly to be demonstrated to the eye by evaporation of the water or\r\nby chemical precipitation, represents the latter.\r\n\r\nThe results of these actions, integrated over geological time,\r\nare enormous. The entire bulk of the sedimentary rocks, such as\r\nsandstones, slates, shales, conglomerates, limestones, etc., and\r\nthe salt content of the ocean, are due to the combined activity\r\nof mechanical and solvent denudation. We shall, later on, make an\r\nestimate of the magnitude of the quantities actually involved.\r\n\r\nIn the Swiss valleys we see torrents of muddy water hurrying\r\nalong, and if we follow them up, we trace them to glaciers high\r\namong the mountains. From beneath the foot of the glacier, we\r\nfind, the torrent has birth. The first debris given to the river\r\nis derived from the wearing of the rocky bed along which the\r\nglacier moves. The river of ice bequeaths to the river of\r\nwater--of which it is the parent--the spoils which it has won from\r\nthe rocks\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nThe work of mechanical disintegration is, however, not restricted\r\nto the glacier's bed. It proceeds everywhere over the surface of\r\nthe rocks. It is aided by the most diverse actions. For instance,\r\nthe freezing and expansion of water in the chinks and cracks in\r\nthose alpine heights where between sunrise and sunset the heat of\r\nsummer reigns, and between sunset and sunrise the cold of winter.\r\nAgain, under these conditions the mere change of surface\r\ntemperature from night to day severely stresses the surface\r\nlayers of the rocks, and, on the same principles as we explain\r\nthe fracture of an unequally heated glass vessel, the rocks\r\ncleave off in slabs which slip down the steeps of the mountain\r\nand collect as screes in the valley. At lower levels the\r\nexpansive force of vegetable growth is not unimportant, as all\r\nwill admit who have seen the strong roots of the pines\r\npenetrating the crannies of the rocks. Nor does the river which\r\nflows in the bed of the valley act as a carrier only. Listening\r\ncarefully we may detect beneath the roar of the alpine torrent\r\nthe crunching and knocking of descending boulders. And in the\r\npotholes scooped by its whirling waters we recognise the abrasive\r\naction of the suspended sand upon the river bed.\r\n\r\nA view from an Alpine summit reveals a scene of remarkable\r\ndesolation (Pl. V, p. 40). Screes lie piled against the steep\r\nslopes. Cliffs stand shattered and ready to fall in ruins. And\r\nhere the forces at work readily reveal themselves. An occasional\r\nwreath of white smoke among\r\n\r\n32\r\n\r\nthe far-off peaks, followed by a rumbling reverberation, marks\r\nthe fall of an avalanche. Water everywhere trickles through the\r\nshaly _débris_ scattered around. In the full sunshine the rocks are\r\nalmost too hot to bear touching. A few hours later the cold is\r\ndeadly, and all becomes a frozen silence. In such scenes of\r\ndesolation and destruction, detrital sediments are actively being\r\ngenerated. As we descend into the valley we hear the deep voice\r\nof the torrents which are continually hurrying the disintegrated\r\nrocks to the ocean.\r\n\r\nA remarkable demonstration of the activity of mechanical\r\ndenudation is shown by the phenomenon of \"earth pillars.\" The\r\nphotograph (Pl. IV.) of the earth pillars of the Val d'Hérens\r\n(Switzerland) shows the peculiar appearance these objects\r\npresent. They arise under conditions where large stones or\r\nboulders are scattered in a deep deposit of clay, and where much\r\nof the denudation is due to water scour. The large boulders not\r\nonly act as shelter against rain, but they bind and consolidate\r\nby their mere weight the clay upon which they rest. Hence the\r\nmaterials underlying the boulders become more resistant, and as\r\nthe surrounding clays are gradually washed away and carried to\r\nthe streams, these compacted parts persist, and, finally, stand\r\nlike walls or pillars above the general level. After a time the\r\ngreat boulders fall off and the underlying clay becomes worn by\r\nthe rainwash to fantastic spikes and ridges. In the Val d'Hérens\r\nthe earth pillars are formed\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\nof the deep moraine stuff which thickly overlies the slopes of\r\nthe valley. The wall of pillars runs across the axis of the\r\nvalley, down the slope of the hill, and crosses the road, so that\r\nit has to be tunnelled to permit the passage of traffic. It is\r\nnot improbable that some additional influence--possibly the\r\npresence of lime--has hardened the material forming the pillars,\r\nand tended to their preservation.\r\n\r\nDenudation has, however, other methods of work than purely\r\nmechanical; methods more noiseless and gentle, but not less\r\neffective, as the victories of peace ate no less than those of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nOver the immense tracts of the continents chemical work proceeds\r\nrelentlessly. The rock in general, more especially the primary\r\nigneous rock, is not stable in presence of the atmosphere and of\r\nwater. Some of the minerals, such as certain silicates and\r\ncarbonates, dissolve relatively fast, others with extreme\r\nslowness. In the process of solution chemical actions are\r\ninvolved; oxidation in presence of the free oxygen of the\r\natmosphere; attack by the feeble acid arising from the solution\r\nof carbon dioxide in water; or, again, by the activity of certain\r\nacids--humous acids--which originate in the decomposition of\r\nvegetable remains. These chemical agents may in some instances,\r\n_e.g._ in the case of carbonates such as limestone or\r\ndolomite--bring practically the whole rock into solution. In other\r\ninstances--_e.g._ granites, basalts, etc.--they may remove some of\r\nthe\r\n\r\n34\r\n\r\nconstituent minerals completely or partially, such as felspar,\r\nolivine, augite, and leave more resistant substances to be\r\nultimately washed down as fine sand or mud into the river.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult or impossible to appraise the relative\r\nefficiency of mechanical and chemical denudation in removing the\r\nmaterials from a certain area. There can be, indeed, little doubt\r\nthat in mountainous regions the mechanical effects are largely\r\npredominant. The silts of glacial rivers are little different\r\nfrom freshly-powdered rock. The water which carries them but\r\nlittle different from the pure rain or snow which falls from the\r\nsky. There has not been time for the chemical or solvent actions\r\nto take place. Now while gravitational forces favour sudden shock\r\nand violent motions in the hills, the effect of these on solvent\r\nand chemical denudation is but small. Nor is good drainage\r\nfavourable to chemical actions, for water is the primary factor\r\nin every case. Water takes up and removes soluble combinations of\r\nmolecules, and penetrates beneath residual insoluble substances.\r\nIt carries the oxygen and acids downwards through the soils, and\r\nfinally conveys the results of its own work to the rivers and\r\nstreams. The lower mean temperature of the mountains as well as\r\nthe perfect drainage diminishes chemical activities.\r\n\r\nHence we conclude that the heights are not generally favourable\r\nto the purely solvent and chemical actions. It is on the\r\nlower-lying land that soils tend to accumulate,\r\n\r\n35\r\n\r\nand in these the chief solvent and the chief chemical denudation\r\nof the Earth are effected.\r\n\r\nThe solvent and chemical effects which go on in the\r\nfinely-divided materials of the soils may be observed in the\r\nlaboratory. They proceed faster than would be anticipated. The\r\nobservation is made by passing a measured quantity of water\r\nbackwards and forwards for some months through a tube containing\r\na few grammes of powdered rock. Finally the water is analysed,\r\nand in this manner the amount of dissolved matter it has taken up\r\nis estimated. The rock powder is examined under the microscope in\r\norder to determine the size of the grains, and so to calculate\r\nthe total surface exposed to the action of the water. We must be\r\ncareful in such experiments to permit free oxidation by the\r\natmosphere. Results obtained in this way of course take no\r\naccount of the chemical effects of organic acids such as exist in\r\nthe soils. The quantities obtained in the laboratory will,\r\ntherefore, be deficient as compared with the natural results.\r\n\r\nIn this manner it has been found that fresh basalt exposed to\r\ncontinually moving water will lose about 0.20 gramme per square\r\nmetre of surface per year. The mineral orthoclase, which enters\r\nlargely into the constitution of many granites, was found to lose\r\nunder the same conditions 0.025 gramme. A glassy lava (obsidian)\r\nrich in silica and in the chemical constituents of an average\r\ngranite, was more resistant still; losing but 0.013 gramme per\r\nsquare metre per year. Hornblende, a mineral\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\nabundant in many rocks, lost 0.075 gramme. The mean of the\r\nresults showed that 0.08 gramme was washed in a year from each\r\nsquare metre. Such results give us some indication of the rate at\r\nwhich the work of solution goes on in the finely divided\r\nsoils.[1]\r\n\r\nIt might be urged that, as the mechanical break up of rocks, and\r\nthe production in this way of large surfaces, must be at the\r\nbasis of solvent and chemical denudation, these latter activities\r\nshould be predominant in the mountains. The answer to this is\r\nthat the soils rarely owe their existence to mechanical actions.\r\nThe alluvium of the valleys constitutes only narrow margins to\r\nthe rivers; the finer _débris_ from the mountains is rapidly\r\nbrought into the ocean. The soils which cover the greater part of\r\ncontinental areas have had a very different origin.\r\n\r\nIn any quarry where a section of the soil and of the underlying\r\nrock is visible, we may study the mode of formation of soils. Our\r\nobservations are, we will suppose, pursued in a granite quarry.\r\nWe first note that the material of the soil nearest the surface\r\nis intermixed with the roots of grasses, trees, or shrubs.\r\nExamining a handful of this soil, we see glistening flakes of\r\nmica which plainly are derived from the original granite. Washing\r\noff the finer particles, we find the largest remaining grains are\r\ncomposed of the all but indestructible quartz.\r\n\r\n[1] Proc. Roy. Irish Acad., VIII., Ser. A, p. 21.\r\n\r\n37\r\n\r\nThis also is from the granite. Some few of the grains are of\r\nchalky-looking felspar; again a granitic mineral. What is the\r\nfiner silt we have washed off? It, too, is composed of mineral\r\nparticles to a great extent; rock dust stained with iron oxide\r\nand intermixed with organic remains, both animal and vegetable.\r\nBut if we make a chemical analysis of the finer silt we find that\r\nthe composition is by no means that of the granite beneath. The\r\nchemist is able to say, from a study of his results, that there\r\nhas been, in the first place, a large loss of material attending\r\nthe conversion of the granite to the soil. He finds a\r\nconcentration of certain of the more resistant substances of the\r\ngranite arising from the loss of the less resistant. Thus the\r\npercentage amount of alumina is increased. The percentage of iron\r\nis also increased. But silica and most other substances show a\r\ndiminished percentage. Notably lime has nearly disappeared. Soda\r\nis much reduced; so is magnesia. Potash is not so completely\r\nabstracted. Finally, owing to hydration, there is much more\r\ncombined water in the soil than in the rock. This is a typical\r\nresult for rocks of this kind.\r\n\r\nDeeper in the soil we often observe a change of texture. It has\r\nbecome finer, and at the same time the clay is paler in colour.\r\nThis subsoil represents the finer particles carried by rain from\r\nabove. The change of colour is due to the state of the iron which\r\nis less oxidised low down in the soil. Beneath the subsoil the\r\nsoil grows\r\n\r\n38\r\n\r\nagain coarser. Finally, we recognise in it fragments of granite\r\nwhich ever grow larger as we descend, till the soil has become\r\nreplaced by the loose and shattered rock. Beneath this the only\r\nsign of weathering apparent in the rock is the rusty hue imparted\r\nby the oxidised iron which the percolating rain has leached from\r\niron-bearing minerals.\r\n\r\nThe soil we have examined has plainly been derived in situ from\r\nthe underlying rock. It represents the more insoluble residue\r\nafter water and acids have done their work. Each year there must\r\nbe a very slow sinking of the surface, but the ablation is\r\ninfinitesimal.\r\n\r\nThe depth of such a soil may be considerable. The total surface\r\nexposed by the countless grains of which it is composed is\r\nenormous. In a cubic foot of average soil the surface area of the\r\ngrains may be 50,000 square feet or more. Hence a soil only two\r\nfeet deep may expose 100,000 square feet for each square foot of\r\nsurface area.\r\n\r\nIt is true that soils formed in this manner by atmospheric and\r\norganic actions take a very long time to grow. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that the process is throughout attended by\r\nthe removal in solution: of chemically altered materials.\r\n\r\nConsiderations such as the foregoing must convince us that while\r\nthe accumulation of the detrital sediments around the continents\r\nis largely the result of activities progressing on the steeper\r\nslopes of the land, that is,\r\n\r\n39\r\n\r\namong the mountainous regions, the feeding of the salts to the\r\nocean arises from the slower work of meteorological and organic\r\nagencies attacking the molecular constitution of the rocks;\r\nprocesses which best proceed where the drainage is sluggish and\r\nthe quiescent conditions permit of the development of abundant\r\norganic growth and decay.\r\n\r\nStatistics of the solvent denudation of the continents support\r\nthis view. Within recent years a very large amount of work has\r\nbeen expended on the chemical investigation of river waters of\r\nAmerica and of Europe. F. W. Clarke has, at the expense of much\r\nlabour, collected and compared these results. They are expressed\r\nas so many tonnes removed in solution per square mile per annum.\r\nFor North America the result shows 79 tonnes so removed; for\r\nEurope 100 tonnes. Now there is a notable difference between the\r\nmean elevations of these two continents. North America has a mean\r\nelevation of 700 metres over sea level, whereas the mean\r\nelevation of Europe is but 300 metres. We see in these figures\r\nthat the more mountainous land supplies less dissolved matter to\r\nthe ocean than the land of lower elevation, as our study has led\r\nus to expect.\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the source of the detrital sediments, as\r\nwell as of the dissolved matter which has given to the ocean, in\r\nthe course of geological time, its present gigantic load of\r\nsalts. It is true there are further solvent and chemical effects\r\nexerted by the sea water\r\n\r\n40\r\n\r\nupon the sediments discharged into it; but we are justified in\r\nconcluding that, relatively to the similar actions taking place\r\nin the soils, the solvent and chemical work of the ocean is\r\nsmall. The fact is, the deposited detrital sediments around the\r\ncontinents occupy an area small when contrasted with the vast\r\nstretches of the land. The area of deposition is much less than\r\nthat of denudation; probably hardly as much as one twentieth.\r\nAnd, again, the conditions of aeration and circulation which\r\nlargely promote chemical and solvent denudation in the soils are\r\nrelatively limited and ineffective in the detrital oceanic\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe summation of the amounts of dissolved and detrital materials\r\nwhich denudation has brought into the ocean during the long\r\ndenudative history of the Earth, as we might anticipate, reveals\r\nquantities of almost unrealisable greatness. The facts are among\r\nthe most impressive which geological science has brought to\r\nlight. Elsewhere in this volume they have been mentioned when\r\ndiscussing the age of the Earth. In the present connection,\r\nhowever, they are deserving of separate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe basis of our reasoning is that the ocean owes its saltness\r\nmainly if not entirely to the denudative activities we have been\r\nconsidering. We must establish this.\r\n\r\nWe may, in the first place, say that any other view at once\r\nraises the greatest difficulties. The chemical composition of the\r\ndetrital sediments which are spread over\r\n\r\n41\r\n\r\nthe continents and which build up the mountains, differs on the\r\naverage very considerably from that of the igneous rocks. We know\r\nthe former have been derived from the latter, and we know that\r\nthe difference in the composition of the two classes of materials\r\nis due to the removal in solution of certain of the constituents\r\nof the igneous rocks. But the ocean alone can have received this\r\ndissolved matter. We know of no other place in which to look for\r\nit. It is true that some part of this dissolved matter has been\r\nagain rejected by the ocean; thus the formation of limestone is\r\nlargely due to the abstraction of lime from sea water by organic\r\nand other agencies. This, however, in no way relieves us of the\r\nnecessity of tracing to the ocean the substances dissolved from\r\nthe igneous rocks. It follows that we have here a very causa for\r\nthe saltness of the ocean. The view that the ocean \"was salt from\r\nthe first\" is without one known fact to support it, and leaves us\r\nwith the burden of the entire dissolved salts of geological time\r\nto dispose of--Where and how?\r\n\r\nThe argument we have outlined above becomes convincingly strong\r\nwhen examined more closely. For this purpose we first compare the\r\naverage chemical composition of the sedimentary and the igneous\r\nrocks.

To this rule the lime-content appears to\r\nbe an exception. It is not so in reality. Its high value in the\r\nsediments is due to its restoration from the ocean to the land.\r\nThe magnesia and potash are, also, largely restored from the\r\nocean; the former in dolomites and magnesian limestones; the\r\nlatter in glauconite sands. The iron of the sediments shows\r\nincreased oxidation. The most notable difference in the two\r\nanalyses appears, however, in the soda percentages. This falls\r\nfrom 3.41 in the igneous rock to 1.12 in the average sediment.\r\nIndeed, this\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\ndeficiency of soda in sedimentary rocks is so characteristic of\r\nsecondary rocks that it may with some safety be applied to\r\ndiscriminate between the two classes of substances in cases where\r\npetrological distinctions of other kinds break down.\r\n\r\nTo what is this so marked deficiency of soda to be ascribed? It\r\nis a result of the extreme solubility of the salts of sodium in\r\nwater. This has not only rendered its deposition by evaporation a\r\nrelatively rare and unimportant incident of geological history,\r\nbut also has protected it from abstraction from the ocean by\r\norganic agencies. The element sodium has, in fact, accumulated in\r\nthe ocean during the whole of geological time.\r\n\r\nWe can use the facts associated with the accumulation of sodium\r\nsalts in the ocean as a means of obtaining additional support to\r\nthe view, that the processes of solvent denudation are\r\nresponsible for the saltness of the ocean. The new evidence may\r\nbe stated as follows: Estimates of the amounts of sedimentary\r\nrock on the continents have repeatedly been made. It is true that\r\nthese estimates are no more than approximations. But they\r\nundoubtedly _are_ approximations, and as such may legitimately be\r\nused in our argument; more especially as final agreement tends to\r\ncheck and to support the several estimates which enter into\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe most recent and probable estimates of the sediments on the\r\nland assign an average thickness of one mile of\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\nsecondary rocks over the land area of the world. To this some\r\nincrease must be made to allow for similar materials concealed in\r\nthe ocean, principally around the continental margins. If we add\r\n10 per cent. and assign a specific gravity of 2.5 we get as the\r\nmass of the sediments 64 x 1016 tonnes. But as this is about 67\r\nper cent. of the parent igneous rock--_i.e._ the average igneous\r\nrock from which the sediments are derived--we conclude that the\r\nprimary denuded rock amounted to a mass of about 95 x 1016\r\ntonnes.\r\n\r\nNow from the mean chemical composition of the secondary rocks we\r\ncalculate that the mass of sediments as above determined contains\r\n0.72 x1016 tonnes of the sodium oxide, Na2O. If to this amount we\r\nadd the quantity of sodium oxide which must have been given to\r\nthe ocean in order to account for the sodium salts contained\r\ntherein, we arrive at a total quantity of oxide of sodium which\r\nmust be that possessed by the primary rock before denudation\r\nbegan its work upon it. The mass of the ocean being well\r\nascertained, we easily calculate that the sodium in the ocean\r\nconverted to sodium oxide amounts to 2.1 x 1016 tonnes. Hence\r\nbetween the estimated sediments and the waters of the ocean we\r\ncan account for 2.82 x 1016 tonnes of soda. When now we put this\r\nquantity back into the estimated mass of primary rock we find\r\nthat it assigns to the primary rock a soda percentage of 3.0. On\r\nthe average analysis given above this should be 3.41 per cent.\r\nThe agreement,\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\nall things considered, more especially the uncertainty in the\r\nestimate of the sediments, is plainly in support of the view that\r\noceanic salts are derived from the rocks; if, indeed, it does not\r\nrender it a certainty.\r\n\r\nA leading and fundamental inference in the denudative history of\r\nthe Earth thus finds support: indeed, we may say, verification.\r\nIn the light of this fact the whole work of denudation stands\r\nrevealed. That the ocean began its history as a vast fresh-water\r\nenvelope of the Globe is a view which accords with the evidence\r\nfor the primitive high temperature of the Earth. Geological\r\nhistory opened with the condensation of an atmosphere of immense\r\nextent, which, after long fluctuations between the states of\r\nsteam and water, finally settled upon the surface, almost free of\r\nmatter in solution: an ocean of distilled water. The epoch of\r\ndenudation then began. It will, probably, continue till the\r\nwaters, undergoing further loss of thermal energy, suffer yet\r\nanother change of state, when their circulation will cease and\r\ntheir attack upon the rocks come to an end.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been reviewed above it is evident that the sodium\r\nin the ocean is an index of the total activity of denudation\r\nintegrated over geological time. From this the broad facts of the\r\nresults of denudation admit of determination with considerable\r\naccuracy. We can estimate the amount of rock which has been\r\ndegraded by solvent and chemical actions, and the amount of\r\nsediments which has been derived from it. We are,\r\n\r\n46\r\n\r\nthus, able to amend our estimate of the sediments which, as\r\ndetermined by direct observation, served to support the basis of\r\nour argument.\r\n\r\nWe now go straight to the ocean for the amount of sodium of\r\ndenudative origin. There may, indeed, have been some primitive\r\nsodium dissolved by a more rapid denudation while the Earth's\r\nsurface was still falling in temperature. It can be shown,\r\nhowever, that this amount was relatively small. Neglecting it we\r\nmay say with safety that the quantity of sodium carried into the\r\nocean by the rivers must be between 14,000 and 15,000 million\r\nmillion tonnes: _i.e._ 14,500 x 1012 tonnes, say.\r\n\r\nKeeping the figures to round numbers we find that this amount of\r\nsodium involves the denudation of about 80 x 1016 tonnes of\r\naverage igneous rock to 53 x 1016 tonnes of average sediment.\r\nFrom these vast quantities we know that the parent rock denuded\r\nduring geological time amounted to some 300 million cubic\r\nkilometres or about seventy million cubic miles. The sediments\r\nderived therefrom possessed a bulk of 220 million cubic\r\nkilometres or fifty million cubic miles. The area of the land\r\nsurface of the Globe is 144 million square kilometres. The parent\r\nrock would have covered this to a uniform depth of rather more\r\nthan two kilometres, and the derived sediment to more than 1.5\r\nkilometres, or about one mile deep.\r\n\r\nThe slow accomplishment of results so vast conveys some idea of\r\nthe great duration of geological time.\r\n\r\n47\r\n\r\nThe foregoing method of investigating the statistics of solvent\r\ndenudation is capable of affording information not only as to the\r\namount of sediments upon the land, but also as to the quantity\r\nwhich is spread over the floor of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe see this when we follow the fate of the 33 per cent. of\r\ndissolved salts which has been leached from the parent igneous\r\nrock, and the mass of which we calculate from the ascertained\r\nmass of the latter, to be 27 x 1016 tonnes. This quantity was at\r\none time or another all in the ocean. But, as we saw above, a\r\ncertain part of it has been again abstracted from solution,\r\nchiefly by organic agencies. Now the abstracted solids have not\r\nbeen altogether retained beneath the ocean. Movements of the land\r\nduring geological time have resulted in some portion being\r\nuplifted along with other sediments. These substances constitute,\r\nmainly, the limestones.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the 27 x 1016 tonnes of substances leached\r\nfrom the parent igneous rocks have had a threefold destination.\r\nOne part is still in solution; a second part has been\r\nprecipitated to the bottom of the ocean; a third part exists on\r\nthe land in the form of calcareous rocks.\r\n\r\nObservation on the land sediments shows that the calcareous rocks\r\namount to about 5 per cent. of the whole. From this we find that\r\n3 x 1016 tonnes, approximately, of such rocks have been taken\r\nfrom the ocean. This accounts for one of the three classes of\r\nmaterial\r\n\r\n48\r\n\r\ninto which the original dissolved matter has been divided.\r\nAnother of the three quantities is easily estimated: the amount\r\nof matter still in solution in the ocean. The volume of the ocean\r\nis 1,414 million cubic kilometres and its mass is 145 x 1016\r\ntonnes. The dissolved salts in it constitute 3.4 per cent. of its\r\nmass; or, rather more than 5 x 1016 tonnes. The limestones on the\r\nland and the salts in the sea water together make up about 8 x\r\n1016 tonnes. If we, now, deduct this from the total of 27 x 1016\r\ntonnes, we find that about 19 x 1016 tonnes must exist as\r\nprecipitated matter on the floor of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe area of the ocean is 367 x 1012 square metres, so that if the\r\nprecipitated sediment possesses an average specific gravity of\r\n2.5, it would cover the entire floor to a uniform depth of 218\r\nmetres; that is 715 feet. This assumes that there was uniform\r\ndeposition of the abstracted matter over the floor of the ocean.\r\nOf course, this assumption is not justifiable. It is certain that\r\nthe rate of deposition on the floor of the sea has varied\r\nenormously with various conditions--principally with the depth.\r\nAgain, it must be remembered that this estimate takes no account\r\nof solid materials otherwise brought into the oceanic deposits;\r\n_e.g._, by wind-transported dust from the land or volcanic\r\nejectamenta in the ocean depths. It is not probable, however,\r\nthat any considerable addition to the estimated mean depth of\r\ndeposit from such sources would be allowable.\r\n\r\n49\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the quantities involved in these determinations\r\nis almost awe inspiring. Take the case of the dissolved salts in\r\nthe ocean. They are but a fraction, as we have seen, of the total\r\nresults of solvent denudation and represent the integration of\r\nthe minute traces contributed by the river water. Yet the common\r\nsalt (chloride of sodium) alone, contained in the ocean, would,\r\nif abstracted and spread over the dry land as a layer of rock\r\nsalt having a specific gravity of 2.2, cover the whole to a depth\r\nof 107 metres or 354 feet. The total salts in solution in the\r\nocean similarly spread over the land would increase the depth of\r\nthe layer to 460 feet. After considering what this means we have\r\nto remember that this amount of matter now in solution in the\r\nseas is, in point of fact, less than a fifth part of the total\r\ndissolved from the rocks during geological time.\r\n\r\nThe transport by denudation of detrital and dissolved matter from\r\nthe land to the ocean has had a most important influence on the\r\nevents of geological history. The existing surface features of\r\nthe earth must have been largely conditioned by the dynamical\r\neffects arising therefrom. In dealing with the subject of\r\nmountain genesis we will, elsewhere, see that all the great\r\nmountain ranges have originated in the accumulation of the\r\ndetrital sediments near the shore in areas which, in consequence\r\nof the load, gradually became depressed and developed into\r\nsynclines of many thousands of feet in depth. The most impressive\r\nsurface features of the Globe originated\r\n\r\n50\r\n\r\nin this manner. We will see too that these events were of a\r\nrhythmic character; the upraising of the mountains involving\r\nintensified mechanical denudation over the elevated area and in\r\nthis way an accelerated transport of detritus to the sea; the\r\nformation of fresh deposits; renewed synclinal sinking of the sea\r\nfloor, and, finally, the upheaval of a younger mountain range.\r\nThis extraordinary sequence of events has been determined by the\r\nevents of detrital denudation acting along with certain general\r\nconditions which have all along involved the growth of\r\ncompressive stresses in the surface crust of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe effects of purely solvent denudation are less easily traced,\r\nbut, very probably, they have been of not less importance. I\r\nrefer here to the transport from the land to the sea of matter in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nSolvent denudation, as observed above, takes place mainly in the\r\nsoils and in this way over the more level continental areas. It\r\nhas resulted in the removal from the land and transfer to the\r\nocean of an amount of matter which represents a uniform layer of\r\none half a kilometre; that is of more than 1,600 feet of rock.\r\nThe continents have, during geological time, been lightened to\r\nthis extent. On the other hand all this matter has for the\r\ngreater part escaped the geosynclines and become uniformly\r\ndiffused throughout the ocean or precipitated over its floor\r\nprincipally on the continental slopes before the great depths are\r\nreached. Of this material the ocean\r\n\r\n51\r\n\r\nwaters contain in solution an amount sufficient to increase their\r\nspecific gravity by 2.7 per cent.\r\n\r\nTaking the last point first, it is interesting to note the\r\neffects upon the bulk of the ocean which has resulted from the\r\nmatter dissolved in it. From the known density of average sea\r\nwater we find that 100 ccs. of it weigh just 102.7 grammes. Of\r\nthis 3.5 per cent. by weight are solids in solution. That is to\r\nsay, 3.594 grammes. Hence the weight of water present is 99.1\r\ngrammes, or a volume of 99.1 ccs. From this we see that the salts\r\npresent have increased the volume by 0.9 ccs. or 0.9 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe average depth of the ocean is 2,000 fathoms or 3,700 metres.\r\nThe increase of depth due to salts dissolved in the ocean has\r\nbeen, therefore, 108 feet or 33.24 metres. This result assumes\r\nthat there has been no increased elastic compression due to the\r\nincreased pressure, and no change of compressional elastic\r\nproperties. We may be sure that the rise on the shore line of the\r\nland has not been less than 100 feet.\r\n\r\nWe see then that as the result of solvent denudation we have to\r\ndo with a heavier and a deeper ocean, expanded in volume by\r\nnearly one per cent. and the floor of which has become raised, on\r\nan average, about 700 feet by precipitated sediment.\r\n\r\nOne of the first conceptions, which the student of geology has to\r\ndismiss from his mind, is that of the immobility or rigidity of\r\nthe Earth's crust. The lane, we live on sways even to the gentle\r\nrise and fail of ocean tides\r\n\r\n52\r\n\r\naround the coasts. It suffers its own tidal oscillations due to\r\nthe moon's attractions. Large tracts of semi-liquid matter\r\nunderlie it. There is every evidence that the raised features of\r\nthe Globe are sustained by such pressures acting over other and\r\nadjacent areas as serve to keep them in equilibrium against the\r\nforce of gravity. This state of equilibrium, which was first\r\nrecognised by Pratt, as part of the dynamics of the Earth's\r\ncrust, has been named isostasy. The state of the crust is that of\r\n\"mobile equilibrium.\"\r\n\r\nThe transfer of matter from the exposed land surfaces to the\r\nsub-oceanic slopes of the continents and the increase in the\r\ndensity of the ocean, must all along have been attended by\r\nisostatic readjustment. We cannot take any other view. On the one\r\nhand the land was being lightened; on the other the sea was\r\nincreasing in mass and depth and the flanks of the continents\r\nwere being loaded with the matter removed from the land and borne\r\nin solution to the ocean. How important the resulting movements\r\nmust have been may be gathered from the fact that the existing\r\nland of the Globe stands at a mean elevation of no more than\r\n2,000 feet above sea level. We have seen that solvent denudation\r\nremoved over 1,600 feet of rock. But we have no evidence that on\r\nthe whole the elevation of land in the past was ever very\r\ndifferent from what it now is.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, presented to our view the remarkable fact that\r\nthroughout the past, and acting with extreme\r\n\r\n53\r\n\r\nslowness, the land has steadily been melted down into the sea and\r\nas steadily been upraised from the waters. It is possible that\r\nthe increased bulk of the ocean has led to a certain diminution\r\nof the exposed land area. The point is a difficult one. One thing\r\nwe may without much risk assume. The sub-aereal current of\r\ndissolved matter from the land to the ocean was accompanied by a\r\nsub-crustal flux from the ocean areas to the land areas; the\r\nheated viscous materials creeping from depths far beneath the\r\nocean floor to depths beneath the roots of the mountains which\r\narose around the oceans. Such movements took ages for their\r\naccomplishment. Indeed, they have been, probably, continuous all\r\nalong and are still proceeding. A low degree of viscosity will\r\nsuffice to permit of movements so slow. Superimposed upon these\r\nmovements the rhythmic alternations of depression and elevation\r\nof the geosynclines probably resulted in releasing the crust from\r\nlocal accumulation of strains arising in the more rigid surface\r\nmaterials. The whole sequence of movements presents an\r\nextraordinary picture of pseudo-vitality--reminding us of the\r\ncirculatory and respiratory systems of a vast organism.\r\n\r\nAll great results in our universe are founded in motions and\r\nforces the most minute. In contemplating the Cause or the Effect\r\nwe stand equally impressed with the spectacle presented to us. We\r\nshall now turn from the great effects of denudation upon the\r\nhistory and evolution of a world and consider for a moment\r\nactivities\r\n\r\n54\r\n\r\nso minute in detail that their operations will probably for ever\r\nelude our bodily senses, but which nevertheless have necessarily\r\naffected and modified the great results we have been\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nThe ocean a little way from the land is generally so free from\r\nsuspended sediments that it has a blackness as of ink. This\r\nblackness is due to its absolute freedom from particles\r\nreflecting the sun's light. The beautiful blue of the Swiss and\r\nItalian lakes is due to the presence of very fine particles\r\ncarried into them by the rivers; the finest flour of the\r\nglaciers, which remain almost indefinitely suspended in the\r\nwater. But in the ocean it is only in those places where rapid\r\ncurrents running over shallows stir continually the sediments or\r\nwhere the fresh water of a great river is carried far from the\r\nland, that the presence of silt is to be observed. The beautiful\r\nphenomenon of the coal-black sea is familiar to every yachtsman\r\nwho has sailed to the west of our Islands.[1]\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, a very remarkable difference in the manner of\r\nsettlement of fine sediments in salt and in fresh water. We are\r\nhere brought into contact with one of those subtle yet\r\ninfluential natural actions the explanation of which involves\r\nscientific advance along many apparently unconnected lines of\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n[1] See Tyndall's Voyage to Algeria in _Fragments of Science._ The\r\ncause of the blue colour of the lakes has been discussed by\r\nvarious observers, not always with agreement.\r\n\r\n55\r\n\r\nIt is easy to observe in the laboratory the fact of the different\r\nbehaviour of salt and fresh water towards finely divided\r\nsubstances. The nature of the insoluble substance is not\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nWe place, in a good light, two glass vessels of equal dimensions;\r\nthe one filled with sea water, the other with fresh water. Into\r\neach we stir the same weight of very finely powdered slate: just\r\nso much as will produce a cloudiness. In a few hours we find the\r\nsea water limpid. The fresh water is still cloudy, however; and,\r\nindeed, may be hardly different in appearance from what it was at\r\nstarting. In itself this is a most extraordinary experiment. We\r\nwould have anticipated quite the opposite result owing to the\r\ngreater density of the sea water.\r\n\r\nBut a still more interesting experiment remains to be carried\r\nout. In the sea water we have many different salts in solution.\r\nLet us see if these salts are equally responsible for the result\r\nwe have obtained. For this purpose we measure out quantities of\r\nsodium chloride and magnesium chloride in the proportion in which\r\nthey exist in sea water: that is about as seven to one. We add\r\nsuch an equal amount of water to each as represents the dilution\r\nof these salts in sea water. Then finally we stir a little of the\r\nfinely powdered slate into each. It will be found that the\r\nmagnesium chloride, although so much more dilute than the sodium\r\nchloride, is considerably more active in clearing out the\r\nsuspension. We may now try such marine salts as magnesium\r\nsulphate,\r\n\r\n56\r\n\r\nor calcium sulphate against sodium chloride; keeping the marine\r\nproportions. Again we find that the magnesium and calcium salts\r\nare the most effective, although so much more dilute than the\r\nsodium salt.\r\n\r\nThere is no visible clue to the explanation of these results. But\r\nwe must conclude as most probable that some action is at work in\r\nthe sea water and in the salt solutions which clumps or\r\nflocculates the sediment. For only by the gathering of the\r\nparticles together in little aggregates can we explain their\r\nrapid fall to the bottom. It is not a question of viscosity\r\n(_i.e._ of resistance to the motion of the particles), for the\r\nsalt solutions are rather more viscous than the fresh water.\r\nStill more remarkable is the fact that every dissolved substance\r\nwill not bring about the result. Thus if we dissolve sugar in\r\nwater we find that, if anything, the silt settles more slowly in\r\nthe sugar solution than in fresh water.\r\n\r\nNow there is one effect produced by the solution of such salts as\r\nwe have dealt with which is not produced by such bodies as sugar.\r\nThe water is rendered a conductor of electricity. Long ago\r\nFaraday explained this as due to the presence of free atoms of\r\nthe dissolved salt in the solution, carrying electric charges. We\r\nnow speak of the salt as \"ionised.\" That is it is partly split up\r\ninto ions or free electrified atoms of chlorine, sodium,\r\nmagnesium, etc., according to the particular salt in solution.\r\nThis fact leads us to think that these electrified\r\n\r\n57\r\n\r\natoms moving about in the solution may be the cause of the\r\nclumping or flocculation. Such electrified atoms are absent from\r\nthe sugar solution: sugar does not become \"ionised\" when it is\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion that the free electrified atoms play a part in the\r\nphenomenon is strengthened when we recall the remarkable\r\ndifference in the action of sodium chloride and magnesium\r\nchloride. In each of the solutions of these substances there are\r\nfree chlorine atoms each of which carries a single charge of\r\nnegative electricity. As these atoms are alike in both solutions\r\nthe different behaviour of the solutions cannot be due to the\r\nchlorine. But the metallic atom is very different in the two\r\ncases. The ionised sodium atom is known to be _monad_ or carries\r\nbut _one_ positive charge; whereas the magnesium atom is _diad_ and\r\ncarries _two_ positive charges. If, then, we assume that the\r\nmetallic, positively electrified atom is in each case\r\nresponsible, we have something to go on. It may be now stated\r\nthat it has been found by experiment and supported by theory that\r\nthe clumping power of an ion rises very rapidly with its valency;\r\nthat is with the number of unit charges associated with it. Thus\r\ndiads such as magnesium, calcium, barium, etc., are very much\r\nmore efficient than monads such as sodium, potassium, etc., and\r\nagain, triads such as aluminium are, similarly, very much more\r\npowerful than diad atoms. Here, in short, we have arrived at the\r\nactive cause of the phenomenon. Its inner mechanism\r\n\r\n58\r\n\r\nis, however, harder to fathom. A plausible explanation can be\r\noffered, but a study of it would take us too far. Sufficient has\r\nbeen said to show the very subtile nature of the forces at work.\r\n\r\nWe have here an effect due to the sea salts derived by denudation\r\nfrom the land which has been slowly augmenting during geological\r\ntime. It is certain that the ocean was practically fresh water in\r\nremote ages. During those times the silt from the great rivers\r\nwould have been carried very far from the land. A Mississippi of\r\nthose ages would have sent its finer suspensions far abroad on a\r\ncontemporary Gulf stream: not improbably right across the\r\nAtlantic. The earlier sediments of argillaceous type were not\r\ncollected in the geosynclines and the genesis of the mountains\r\nwas delayed proportionately. But it was, probably, not for very\r\nlong that such conditions prevailed. For the accumulation of\r\ncalcium salts must have been rapid, and although the great\r\nsalinity due to sodium salts was of slow growth the salts of the\r\ndiad element calcium must have soon introduced the cooperation of\r\nthe ion in the work of building the mountain.\r\n\r\n59\r\n\r\nTHE ABUNDANCE OF LIFE [1]\r\n\r\nWE had reached the Pass of Tre Croci[2]and from a point a little\r\nbelow the summit, looked eastward over the glorious Val Buona.\r\nThe pines which clothed the floor and lower slopes of the valley,\r\nextended their multitudes into the furthest distance, among the\r\nmany recesses of the mountains, and into the confluent Val di\r\nMisurina. In the sunshine the Alpine butterflies flitted from\r\nstone to stone. The ground at our feet and everywhere throughout\r\nthe forests teamed with the countless millions of the small black\r\nants.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent display of vitality; of the aggressiveness\r\nof vitality, assailing the barren heights of the limestone,\r\nwringing a subsistence from dead things. And the question\r\nsuggested itself with new force: why the abundance of life and\r\nits unending activity?\r\n\r\nIn trying to answer this question, the present sketch\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nI propose to refer for an answer to dynamic considerations. It is\r\napparent that natural selection can only be concerned in a\r\nsecondary way. Natural selection defines\r\n\r\n[1] Proc. Roy. Dublin Soc., vol. vii., 1890.\r\n\r\n[2] In the Dolomites of Southeast Tyrol; during the summer of\r\n1890. Much of what follows was evolved in discussion with my\r\nfellow-traveller, Henry H. Dixon. Much of it is his.\r\n\r\n60\r\n\r\na certain course of development for the organism; but very\r\nevidently some property of inherent progressiveness in the\r\norganism must be involved. The mineral is not affected by natural\r\nselection to enter on a course of continual variation and\r\nmultiplication. The dynamic relations of the organism with the\r\nenvironment are evidently very different from those of inanimate\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DYNAMIC CONDITIONS ATTENDING INANIMATE ACTIONS\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in the first place, to refer briefly to the\r\nphenomena attending the transfer of energy within and into\r\ninanimate material systems. It is not assumed here that these\r\nphenomena are restricted in their sphere of action to inanimate\r\nnature. It is, in fact, very certain that they are not; but while\r\nthey confer on dead nature its own dynamic tendencies, it will\r\nappear that their effects are by various means evaded in living\r\nnature. We, therefore, treat of them as characteristic of\r\ninanimate actions. We accept as fundamental to all the\r\nconsiderations which follow the truth of the principle of the\r\nConservation of Energy.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] \"The principle of the Conservation of Energy has acquired so\r\nmuch scientific weight during the last twenty years that no\r\nphysiologist would feel any confidence in an experiment which\r\nshowed a considerable difference between the work done by the\r\nanimal and the balance of the account of Energy received and\r\nspent.\"--Clerk Maxwell, _Nature_, vol. xix., p. 142. See also\r\nHelmholtz _On the Conservation of Force._\r\n\r\n61\r\n\r\nWhatever speculations may be made as to the course of events very\r\ndistant from us in space, it appears certain that dissipation of\r\nenergy is at present actively progressing throughout our sphere\r\nof observation in inanimate nature. It follows, in fact, from the\r\nsecond law of thermodynamics, that whenever work is derived from\r\nheat, a certain quantity of heat falls in potential without doing\r\nwork or, in short, is dissipated. On the other hand, work may be\r\nentirely converted into heat. The result is the heat-tendency of\r\nthe universe. Heat, being an undirected form of energy, seeks, as\r\nit were, its own level, so that the result of this heat-tendency\r\nis continual approach to uniformity of potential.\r\n\r\nThe heat-tendency of the universe is also revealed in the\r\nfar-reaching \"law of maximum work,\" which defines that chemical\r\nchange, accomplished without the intervention of external energy,\r\ntends to the production of the body, or system of bodies, which\r\ndisengage the greatest quantity of heat.[1] And, again, vast\r\nnumbers of actions going on throughout nature are attended by\r\ndissipatory thermal effects, as those arising from the motions of\r\nproximate molecules (friction, viscosity), and from the fall of\r\nelectrical potential.\r\n\r\nThus, on all sides, the energy which was once most probably\r\nexistent in the form of gravitational potential, is being\r\ndissipated into unavailable forms. We must\r\n\r\n[1] Berthelot, _Essai de Mécanique Chimique._\r\n\r\n62\r\n\r\nrecognize dissipation as an inevitable attendant on inanimate\r\ntransfer of energy.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to consider inanimate actions in relation to\r\ntime, or time-rate of change, we find a new feature in the\r\nphenomena attending transfer of energy; a feature which is really\r\ninvolved in general statements as to the laws of physical\r\ninteractions.[1] It is seen, that the attitude of inanimate\r\nmaterial systems is very generally, if not in all cases,\r\nretardative of change--opposing it by effects generated by the\r\nprimary action, which may be called \"secondary\" for convenience.\r\nFurther, it will be seen that these secondary effects are those\r\nconcerned in bringing about the inevitable dissipation.\r\n\r\nAs example, let us endeavour to transfer gravitational potential\r\nenergy contained in a mass raised above the surface of the Earth\r\ninto an elastic body, which we can put into compression by\r\nresting the weight upon it. In this way work is done against\r\nelastic force and stored as elastic potential energy. We may deal\r\nwith a metal spring, or with a mass of gas contained in a\r\ncylinder fitted with a piston upon which the weight may be\r\nplaced. In either case we find the effect of compression is to\r\nraise the temperature of the substance, thus causing its\r\n\r\n[1] Helmholtz, _Ice and Glaciers._ Atkinson's collection of his\r\nPopular Lectures. First Series, p.120. Quoted by Tate, _Heat_,\r\np. 311.\r\n\r\n63\r\n\r\nexpansion or increased resistance to the descent of the weight.\r\nAnd this resistance continues, with diminishing intensity, till\r\nall the heat generated is dissipated into the surrounding medium.\r\nThe secondary effect thus delays the final transfer of energy.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we suppose the gas in the cylinder replaced by a vapour\r\nin a state of saturation, the effect of increased pressure, as of\r\na weight placed upon the piston, is to reduce the vapour to a\r\nliquid, thereby bringing about a great diminution of volume and\r\nproportional loss of gravitational potential by the weight. But\r\nthis change will by no means be brought about instantaneously.\r\nWhen a little of the vapour is condensed, this portion parts with\r\nlatent heat of vaporisation, increasing the tension of the\r\nremainder, or raising its point of saturation, so that before the\r\nweight descends any further, this heat has to escape from the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nMany more such cases might be cited. The heating of india-rubber\r\nwhen expanded, its cooling when compressed, is a remarkable one;\r\nfor at first sight it appears as if this must render it\r\nexceptional to the general law, most substances exhibiting the\r\nopposite thermal effects when stressed. However, here, too, the\r\naction of the stress is opposed by the secondary effects\r\ndeveloped in the substance; for it is found that this substance\r\ncontracts when heated, expands when cooled. Again, ice being a\r\nsubstance which contracts in melting, the effect of pressure is\r\nto facilitate melting, lowering its freezing point. But\r\n\r\n64\r\n\r\nso soon as a little melting occurs, the resulting liquid calls on\r\nthe residual ice for an amount of heat equivalent to the latent\r\nheat of liquefaction, and so by cooling the whole, retards the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nSuch particular cases illustrate a principle controlling the\r\ninteraction of matter and energy which seems universal in\r\napplication save when evaded, as we shall see, by the ingenuity\r\nof life. This principle is not only revealed in the researches of\r\nthe laboratory; it is manifest in the history of worlds and solar\r\nsystems. Thus, consider the effects arising from the aggregation\r\nof matter in space under the influence of the mutual attraction\r\nof the particles. The tendency here is loss of gravitational\r\npotential. The final approach is however retarded by the\r\ntemperature, or vis viva of the parts attending collision and\r\ncompression. From this cause the great suns of space radiate for\r\nages before the final loss of potential is attained.\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell[1] observes on the general principle that less\r\nforce is required to produce a change in a body when the change\r\nis unopposed by constraints than when it is subjected to such.\r\nFrom this if we assume the external forces acting upon a system\r\nnot to rise above a certain potential (which is the order of\r\nnature), the constraints of secondary actions may, under certain\r\ncircumstances, lead to final rejection of some of the energy, or,\r\nin any\r\n\r\n[1] _Theory of Heat_, p. 131.\r\n\r\n65\r\n\r\ncase, to retardation of change in the system--dissipation of\r\nenergy being the result.[1]\r\n\r\nAs such constraints seem inherently present in the properties of\r\nmatter, we may summarise as follows:\r\n\r\n_The transfer of energy into any inanimate material system is\r\nattended by effects retardative to the transfer and conducive to\r\ndissipation._\r\n\r\nWas this the only possible dynamic order ruling in material\r\nsystems it is quite certain the myriads of ants and pines never\r\ncould have been, except all generated by creative act at vast\r\nprimary expenditure of energy. Growth and reproduction would have\r\nbeen impossible in systems which retarded change at every step\r\nand never proceeded in any direction but in that of dissipation.\r\nOnce created, indeed, it is conceivable that, as heat engines,\r\nthey might have dragged out an existence of alternate life and\r\ndeath; life in the hours of sunshine, death in hours of darkness:\r\nno final death, however, their lot, till their parts were simply\r\nworn out by long use, never made good by repair. But the\r\nsustained and increasing activity of organized nature is a fact;\r\ntherefore some other order of events must be possible.\r\n\r\n[1] The law of Least Action, which has been applied, not alone in\r\noptics, but in many mechanical systems, appears physically based\r\nupon the restraint and retardation opposing the transfer of\r\nenergy in material systems.\r\n\r\n66\r\n\r\nGENERAL DYNAMIC CONDITIONS ATTENDING ANIMATE ACTIONS\r\n\r\nWhat is the actual dynamic attitude of the primary organic\r\nengine--the vegetable organism? We consider, here, in the first\r\nplace, not intervening, but resulting phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe young leaf exposed to solar radiation is small at first, and\r\nthe quantity of radiant energy it receives in unit of time cannot\r\nexceed that which falls upon its surface. But what is the effect\r\nof this energy? Not to produce a retardative reaction, but an\r\naccelerative response: for, in the enlarging of the leaf by\r\ngrowth, the plant opens for itself new channels of supply.\r\n\r\nIf we refer to \"the living protoplasm which, with its unknown\r\nmolecular arrangement, is the only absolute test of the cell and\r\nof the organism in general,[1] we find a similar attitude towards\r\nexternal sources of available energy. In the act of growth\r\nincreased rate of assimilation is involved, so that there is an\r\nacceleration of change till a bulk of maximum activity is\r\nattained. The surface, finally, becomes too small for the\r\nabsorption of energy adequate to sustain further increase of mass\r\n(Spencer[2]), and the acceleration ceases. The waste going on in\r\nthe central parts is then just balanced by the renewal at the\r\nsurface. By division, by spreading of the mass, by\r\n\r\n[1] Claus, _Zoology_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[2] Geddes and Thomson, _The Evolution of Sex_, p. 220.\r\n\r\n67\r\n\r\nout-flowing processes, the normal activity of growth may be\r\nrestored. Till this moment nothing would be gained by any of\r\nthese changes. One or other of them is now conducive to\r\nprogressive absorption of energy by the organism, and one or\r\nother occurs, most generally the best of them, subdivision. Two\r\nunits now exist; the total mass immediately on division is\r\nunaltered, but paths for the more abundant absorption of energy\r\nare laid open.\r\n\r\nThe encystment of the protoplasm (occurring under conditions upon\r\nwhich naturalists do not seem agreed[1]) is to all appearance\r\nprotective from an unfavourable environment, but it is often a\r\nperiod of internal change as well, resulting in a segregation\r\nwithin the mass of numerous small units, followed by a breakup of\r\nthe whole into these units. It is thus an extension of the basis\r\nof supply, and in an impoverished medium, where unit of surface\r\nis less active, is evidently the best means of preserving a\r\ncondition of progress.\r\n\r\nThus, in the organism which forms the basis of all modes of life,\r\na definite law of action is obeyed under various circumstances of\r\nreaction with the available energy of its environment.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the case of the more complex leaf, we see, not only\r\nin the phenomenon of growth, but in its extension in a flattened\r\nform, and in the orientation of greatest surface towards the\r\nsource of energy, an attitude towards\r\n\r\n[1] However, \"In no way comparable with death.\" Weismann,\r\n_Biological Memoirs_, p. 158.\r\n\r\n68\r\n\r\navailable energy causative of accelerated transfer. There is\r\nseemingly a principle at work, leading to the increase of organic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nMany other examples might be adduced. The gastrula stage in the\r\ndevelopment of embryos, where by invagination such an arrangement\r\nof the multiplying cells is secured as to offer the greatest\r\npossible surface consistent with a first division of labour; the\r\nprovision of cilia for drawing upon the energy supplies of the\r\nmedium; and more generally the specialisation of organs in the\r\nhigher developments of life, may alike be regarded as efforts of\r\nthe organism directed to the absorption of energy. When any\r\nparticular organ becomes unavailing in the obtainment of\r\nsupplies, the organ in the course of time becomes aborted or\r\ndisappears.[1] On the other hand, when a too ready and liberal\r\nsupply renders exertion and specialisation unnecessary, a similar\r\nabortion of functionless organs takes place. This is seen in the\r\ndegraded members of certain parasites.\r\n\r\nDuring certain epochs of geological history, the vegetable world\r\ndeveloped enormously; in response probably to liberal supplies of\r\ncarbon dioxide. A structural adaptation to the rich atmosphere\r\noccurred, such as was calculated to cooperate in rapidly\r\nconsuming the supplies, and to this obedience to a law of\r\nprogressive transfer of energy we owe the vast stores of energy\r\nnow accumulated\r\n\r\n[1] Claus, _Zoology_, p. 157\r\n\r\n69\r\n\r\nin our coal fields. And when, further, we reflect that this store\r\nof energy had long since been dissipated into space but for the\r\nintervention of the organism, we see definitely another factor in\r\norganic transfer of energy--a factor acting conservatively of\r\nenergy, or antagonistically to dissipation.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of organized nature in the presence of unlimited\r\nsupplies is to \"run riot.\" This seems so universal a relation,\r\nthat we are safe in seeing here cause and effect, and in drawing\r\nour conclusions as to the attitude of the organism towards\r\navailable energy. New species, when they come on the field of\r\ngeological history, armed with fresh adaptations, irresistible\r\ntill the slow defences of the subjected organisms are completed,\r\nattain enormous sizes under the stimulus of abundant supply, till\r\nfinally, the environment, living and dead, reacts upon them with\r\nrestraining influence. The exuberance of the organism in presence\r\nof energy is often so abundant as to lead by deprivation to its\r\nself-destruction. Thus the growth of bacteria is often controlled\r\nby their own waste products. A moment's consideration shows that\r\nsuch progressive activity denotes an accelerative attitude on the\r\npart of the organism towards the transfer of energy into the\r\norganic material system. Finally, we are conscious in ourselves\r\nhow, by use, our faculties are developed; and it is apparent that\r\nall such progressive developments must rest on actions which\r\nrespond to supplies with fresh demands. Possibly in the present\r\nand ever-\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\nincreasing consumption of inanimate power by civilised races, we\r\nsee revealed the dynamic attitude of the organism working through\r\nthought-processes.\r\n\r\nWhether this be so or not, we find generally in organised nature\r\ncauses at work which in some way lead to a progressive transfer\r\nof energy into the organic system. And we notice, too, that all\r\nis not spent, but both immediately in the growth of the\r\nindividual, and ultimately in the multiplication of the species,\r\nthere are actions associated with vitality which retard the\r\ndissipation of energy. We proceed to state the dynamical\r\nprinciples involved in these manifestations, which appear\r\ncharacteristic of the organism, as follows:--\r\n\r\n_The transfer of energy into any animate material system is\r\nattended by effects conducive to the transfer, and retardative of\r\ndissipation._\r\n\r\nThis statement is, I think, perfectly general. It has been in\r\npart advanced before, but from the organic more than the physical\r\npoint of view. Thus, \"hunger is an essential characteristic of\r\nliving matter\"; and again, \"hunger is a dominant characteristic\r\nof living matter,\"[1] are, in part, expressions of the statement.\r\nIf it be objected against the generality of the statement, that\r\nthere are periods in the life of individuals when stagnation and\r\ndecay make their appearance, we may answer, that\r\n\r\n[1] _Evolution of Sex._ Geddes and Thomson, chap. xvi. See also a\r\nreference to Cope's theory of \"Growth Force,\" in Wallace's\r\n_Darwinism_, p. 425.\r\n\r\n71\r\n\r\nsuch phenomena arise in phases of life developed under conditions\r\nof external constraint, as will be urged more fully further on,\r\nand that in fact the special conditions of old age do not and\r\ncannot express the true law and tendency of the dynamic relations\r\nof life in the face of its evident advance upon the Earth. The\r\nlaw of the unconstrained cell is growth on an ever increasing\r\nscale; and although we assume the organic configuration, whether\r\nsomatic or reproductive, to be essentially unstable, so that\r\ncontinual inflow of energy is required merely to keep it in\r\nexistence, this does not vitiate the fact that, when free of all\r\nexternal constraint, growth gains on waste. Indeed, even in the\r\ncase of old age, the statement remains essentially true, for the\r\nphenomena then displayed point to a breakdown of the functioning\r\npower of the cell, an approximation to configurations incapable\r\nof assimilation. It is not as if life showed in these phenomena\r\nthat its conditions could obtain in the midst of abundance, and\r\nyet its law be suspended; but as if they represented a\r\ndegradation of the very conditions of life, a break up, under the\r\nlaws of the inanimate, of the animate contrivance; so that energy\r\nis no longer available to it, or the primary condition, \"the\r\ntransfer of energy into the animate system,\" is imperfectly\r\nobeyed. It is to the perfect contrivance of life our statement\r\nrefers.\r\n\r\nThat the final end of all will be general non-availability there\r\nseems little reason to doubt, and the organism, itself dependent\r\nupon differences of potential, cannot\r\n\r\n72\r\n\r\nhope to carry on aggregation of energy beyond the period when\r\ndifferences of potential are not. The organism is not accountable\r\nfor this. It is being affected by events external to it, by the\r\nactions going on through inanimate agents. And although there be\r\nonly a part of the received energy preserved, there is a part\r\npreserved, and this amount is continually on the increase. To see\r\nthis it is only necessary to reflect that the sum of animate\r\nenergy--capability of doing work in any way through animate\r\nmeans--at present upon the Earth, is the result, although a small\r\none, of energy reaching the Earth since a remote period, and\r\nwhich otherwise had been dissipated in space. In inanimate\r\nactions throughout nature, as we know it, the availability is\r\ncontinually diminishing. The change is all the one way. As,\r\nhowever, the supply of available energy in the universe is\r\n(probably) limited in amount, we must look upon the two as simply\r\neffecting the final dissipation of potential in very different\r\nways. The animate system is aggressive on the energy available to\r\nit, spends with economy, and invests at interest till death\r\nfinally deprives it of all. It has heirs, indeed, who inherit\r\nsome of its gains, but they, too, must die, and ultimately there\r\nwill be no successors, and the greater part must melt away as if\r\nit had never been. The inanimate system responds to the forces\r\nimposed upon it by sluggish changes; of that which is thrust upon\r\nit, it squanders uselessly. The path of the energy is very\r\ndifferent in the two cases.\r\n\r\n73\r\n\r\nWhile it is true generally that both systems ultimately result in\r\nthe dissipation of energy to uniform potential, the organism can,\r\nas we have seen, under particular circumstances evade the final\r\ndoom altogether. It can lay up a store of potential energy which\r\nmay be permanent. Thus, so long as there is free oxygen in the\r\nuniverse, our coalfields might, at any time in the remote future,\r\ngenerate light and heat in the universal grave.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe on the fundamental distinction between\r\nthe growth of the protoplasm and the growth of the crystal. It is\r\ncommon to draw comparison between the two, and to point to\r\nmetabolism as the chief distinction. But while this is the most\r\nobvious distinction the more fundamental one remains in the\r\nenergy relations of the two with the environment.[1] The growth\r\nof the crystal is the result of loss of energy; that of the\r\norganism the result of gain of energy. The crystal represents a\r\nlast position of stable equilibrium assumed by molecules upon a\r\ncertain loss of kinetic energy, and the formation of the crystal\r\nby evaporation and concentration of a liquid does not, in its\r\ndynamic aspect, differ much from the precipitation of an\r\namorphous sediment. The organism, on the other hand, represents a\r\nmore or less unstable condition formed and maintained by inflow\r\nof energy; its formation, indeed, often attended with a loss of\r\nkinetic energy (fixation of carbon in plants), but, if so,\r\naccompanied by\r\n\r\n[1] It appears exceptional for the crystal line configuration to\r\nstand higher in the scale of energy than the amorphous.\r\n\r\n74\r\n\r\na more than compensatory increase of potential molecular energy.\r\n\r\nThus, between growth in the living world and growth in the dead\r\nworld, the energy relations with the environment reveal a marked\r\ncontrast. Again, in the phenomena of combustion, there are\r\ncertain superficial resemblances which have led to comparison\r\nbetween the two. Here again, however, the attitudes towards the\r\nenergy of the environment stand very much as + and -. The life\r\nabsorbs, stores, and spends with economy. The flame only\r\nrecklessly spends. The property of storage by the organism calls\r\nout a further distinction between the course of the two\r\nprocesses. It secures that the chemical activity of the organism\r\ncan be propagated in a medium in which the supply of energy is\r\ndiscontinuous or localised. The chemical activity of the\r\ncombustion can, strictly speaking, only be propagated among\r\ncontiguous particles. I need not dwell on the latter fact; an\r\nexample of the former is seen in the action of the roots of\r\nplants, which will often traverse a barren place or circumvent an\r\nobstacle in their search for energy. In this manner roots will\r\nfind out spots of rich nutriment.\r\n\r\nThus there is a dynamic distinction between the progress of the\r\norganism and the progress of the combustion, or of the chemical\r\nreaction generally. And although there be unstable chemical\r\nsystems which absorb energy during reaction, these are\r\n(dynamically) no more than the expansion of the compressed gas.\r\nThere is a certain\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\ninitial capacity in the system for a given quantity of energy;\r\nthis satisfied, progress ceases. The progress of the organism in\r\ntime is continual, and goes on from less to greater so long as\r\nits development is unconstrained and the supply of energy is\r\nunlimited.\r\n\r\nWe must regard the organism as a configuration which is so\r\ncontrived as to evade the tendency of the universal laws of\r\nnature. Except we are prepared to believe that a violation of the\r\nsecond law of thermodynamics occurs in the organism, that a\r\n\"sorting demon\" is at work within it, we must, I think, assume\r\nthat the interactions going on among its molecules are\r\naccompanied by retardation and dissipation like the rest of\r\nnature. That such conditions are not incompatible with the\r\ndefinition of the dynamic attitude of the organism, can be shown\r\nby analogy with our inanimate machines which, by aid of\r\nhypotheses in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics, may\r\nbe supposed to fulfil the energy-functions of the plant or\r\nanimal, and, in fact, in all apparent respects conform to the\r\ndefinition of the organism.\r\n\r\nWe may assume this accomplished by a contrivance of the nature of\r\na steam-engine, driven by solar energy. It has a boiler, which we\r\nmay suppose fed by the action of the engine. It has piston,\r\ncranks, and other movable parts, all subject to resistance from\r\nfriction, etc. Now there is no reason why this engine should not\r\nexpend its surplus energy in shaping, fitting, and starting into\r\naction other engines:--in fact, in reproductive sacrifice. All\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\nthese other engines represent a multiplied absorption of energy\r\nas the effects of the energy received by the parent engine, and\r\nmay in time be supposed to reproduce themselves. Further, we may\r\nsuppose the parent engine to be small and capable of developing\r\nvery little power, but the whole series as increasing in power at\r\neach generation. Thus the primary energy relations of the\r\nvegetable organism are represented in these engines, and no\r\nviolation of the second law of thermodynamics involved.\r\n\r\nWe might extend the analogy, and assuming these engines to spend\r\na portion of their surplus energy in doing work against chemical\r\nforces--as, for example, by decomposing water through the\r\nintervention of a dynamo--suppose them to lay up in this way a\r\nstore of potential energy capable of heating the boilers of a\r\nsecond order of engines, representing the graminivorous animal.\r\nIt is obvious without proceeding to a tertiary or carnivorous\r\norder, that the condition of energy in the animal world may be\r\nsupposed fulfilled in these successive series of engines, and no\r\nviolation of the principles governing the actions going on in our\r\nmachines assumed. Organisms evolving on similar principles would\r\nexperience loss at every transfer. Thus only a portion of the\r\nradiant energy absorbed by the leaf would be expended in actual\r\nwork, chemical and gravitational, etc. It is very certain that\r\nthis is, in fact, what takes place.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, worth passing observation that, from the\r\nnutritive dependence of the animal upon the vegetable,\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\nand the fact that a conversion of the energy of the one to the\r\npurposes of the other cannot occur without loss, the mean energy\r\nabsorbed daily by the vegetable for the purpose of growth must\r\ngreatly exceed that used in animal growth; so that the chemical\r\npotential energy of vegetation upon the earth is much greater\r\nthan the energy of all kinds represented in the animal\r\nconfigurations.[1] It appears, too, that in the power possessed\r\nby the vegetable of remaining comparatively inactive, of\r\nsurviving hard times by the expenditure and absorption of but\r\nlittle, the vegetable constitutes a veritable reservoir for the\r\nuniform supply of the more unstable and active animal.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the question of the manner of origin of organic\r\nsystems, it is to be observed that, while the life of the present\r\nis very surely the survival of the fittest of the tendencies and\r\nchances of the past, yet, in the initiation of the organised\r\nworld, a single chance may have decided a whole course of events:\r\nfor, once originated, its own law secures its increase, although\r\nwithin the new order of actions, the law of the fittest must\r\nassert itself. That such a progressive material system as an\r\norganism was possible, and at some remote period was initiated,\r\nis matter of knowledge; whether or not the initiatory living\r\nconfiguration was rare and fortuitous, or the probable result of\r\nthe general action of physical laws acting among innumerable\r\nchances, must remain matter of\r\n\r\n[1] I find a similar conclusion arrived at in Semper's _Animal\r\nLife_, p. 52.\r\n\r\n78\r\n\r\nspeculation. In the event of the former being the truth, it is\r\nevidently possible, in spite of a large finite number of\r\nhabitable worlds, that life is non-existent elsewhere. If the\r\nlatter is the truth, it is almost certain that there is life in\r\nall, or many of those worlds.\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION AND ACCELERATION OF ACTIVITY\r\n\r\nThe primary factor in evolution is the \"struggle for existence.\"\r\nThis involves a \"natural selection\" among the many variations of\r\nthe organism. If we seek the underlying causes of the struggle,\r\nwe find that the necessity of food and (in a lesser degree) the\r\ndesire for a mate are the principal causes of contention. The\r\nformer is much the more important factor, and, accordingly, we\r\nfind the greater degree of specialisation based upon it.\r\n\r\nThe present view assumes a dynamic necessity for its demands\r\ninvolved in the nature of the organism as such. This assumption\r\nis based on observation of the outcome of its unconstrained\r\ngrowth, reproduction, and life-acts. We have the same right to\r\nassert this of the organism as we have to assert that retardation\r\nand degradation attend the actions of inanimate machines, which\r\nassertion, also, is based on observation of results. Thus we pass\r\nfrom the superficial statements that organisms require food in\r\norder to live, or that organisms desire food, to the more\r\nfundamental one that:\r\n\r\n_The organism is a configuration of matter which absorbs energy\r\nacceleratively, without limit, when unconstrained._\r\n\r\n79\r\n\r\nThis is the dynamic basis for a \"struggle for existence.\" The\r\norganism being a material system responding to accession of\r\nenergy with fresh demands, and energy being limited in amount,\r\nthe struggle follows as a necessity. Thus, evolution guiding' the\r\nsteps of the energy-seeking organism, must presuppose and find\r\nits origin in that inherent property of the organism which\r\ndetermines its attitude in presence of available energy.\r\n\r\nTurning to the factor, \"adaptation,\" we find that this also must\r\npresuppose, in order to be explicable, some quality of\r\naggressiveness on the part of the organism. For adaptation in\r\nthis or that direction is the result of repulse or victory, and,\r\ntherefore, we must presuppose an attack. The attack is made by\r\nthe organism in obedience to its law of demand; we see in the\r\nadaptation of the organism but the accumulated wisdom derived\r\nfrom past defeats and victories.\r\n\r\nWhere the environment is active, that is living, adaptation\r\noccurs on both sides. Improved means of defence or improved means\r\nof attack, both presuppose activity. Thus the reactions to the\r\nenvironment, animate and inanimate, are at once the outcome of\r\nthe eternal aggressiveness of the organism, and the source of\r\nfresh aggressiveness upon the resources of the medium.\r\n\r\nAs concerns the \"survival of the fittest\" (or \"natural\r\nselection\"), we can, I think, at once conclude that the organism\r\nwhich best fulfils the organic law under the circumstances of\r\nsupply is the \"fittest,\" _ipso facto._ In many\r\n\r\n80\r\n\r\ncases this is contained in the commonsense consideration, that to\r\nbe strong, consistent with concealment from enemies which are\r\nstronger, is best, as giving the organism mastery over foes which\r\nare weaker, and generally renders it better able to secure\r\nsupplies. Weismann points out that natural selection favours\r\nearly and abundant reproduction. But whether the qualifications\r\nof the \"fittest\" be strength, fertility, cunning, fleetness,\r\nimitation, or concealment, we are safe in concluding that growth\r\nand reproduction must be the primary qualities which at once\r\ndetermine selection and are fostered by it. Inherent in the\r\nnature of the organism is accelerated absorption of energy, but\r\nthe qualifications of the \"fittest\" are various, for the supply\r\nof energy is limited, and there are many competitors for it. To\r\nsecure that none be wasted is ultimately the object of natural\r\nselection, deciding among the eager competitors what is best for\r\neach.\r\n\r\nIn short, the facts and generalisations concerning evolution must\r\npresuppose an organism endowed with the quality of progressive\r\nabsorption of energy, and retentive of it. The continuity of\r\norganic activity in a world where supplies are intermittent is\r\nevidently only possible upon the latter condition. Thus it\r\nappears that the dynamic attitude of the organism, considered in\r\nthese pages, occupies a fundamental position regarding its\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nWe turn to the consideration of old age and death, endeavouring\r\nto discover in what relation they stand to the innate\r\nprogressiveness of the organism.\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\nTHE PERIODICITY OF THE ORGANISM AND THE LAW OF PROGRESSIVE\r\nACTIVITY\r\n\r\nThe organic system is essentially unstable. Its aggressive\r\nattitude is involved in the phenomenon of growth, and in\r\nreproduction which is a form of growth. But the energy absorbed\r\nis not only spent in growth. It partly goes, also, to make good\r\nthe decay which arises from the instability of the organic unit.\r\nThe cell is molecularly perishable. It possesses its entity much\r\nas a top keeps erect, by the continual inflow of energy.\r\nMetabolism is always taking place within it. Any other condition\r\nwould, probably, involve the difficulties of perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of old age is not evident in the case of the\r\nunicellular organism reproducing by fission. At any stage of its\r\nhistory all the individuals are of the same age: all contain a\r\nlike portion of the original cell, so far as this can be regarded\r\nas persisting where there is continual flux of matter and energy.\r\nIn the higher organisms death is universally evident. Why is\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nThe question is one of great complexity. Considered from the more\r\nfundamental molecular point of view we should perhaps look to\r\nfailure of the power of cell division as the condition of\r\nmortality. For it is to this phenomenon--that of cell\r\ndivision--that the continued life of the protozoon is to be\r\nascribed, as we have already seen. Reproduction is, in fact, the\r\nsaving factor here.\r\n\r\nAs we do not know the source or nature of the stimulus\r\n\r\n82\r\n\r\nresponsible for cell division we cannot give a molecular account\r\nof death in the higher organisms. However we shall now see that,\r\nphilosophically, we are entitled to consider reproduction as a\r\nsaving factor in this case also; and to regard the death of the\r\nindividual much as we regard the fall of the leaf from the tree:\r\n_i.e._ as the cessation of an outgrowth from a development\r\nextending from the past into the future. The phenomena of old age\r\nand natural death are, in short, not at variance with the\r\nprogressive activity of the organism. We perceive this when we\r\ncome to consider death from the evolutionary point of view.\r\n\r\nProfessor Weismann, in his two essays, \"The Duration of Life,\"\r\nand \"Life and Death,\"[1] adopts and defends the view that \"death\r\nis not a primary necessity but that it has been secondarily\r\nacquired by adaptation.\" The cell was not inherently limited in\r\nits number of cell-generations. The low unicellular organisms are\r\npotentially immortal, the higher multicellular forms with\r\nwell-differentiated organs contain the germs of death within\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nHe finds the necessity of death in its utility to the species.\r\nLong life is a useless luxury. Early and abundant reproduction is\r\nbest for the species. An immortal individual would gradually\r\nbecome injured and would be valueless or even harmful to the\r\nspecies by taking the place of those that are sound. Hence\r\nnatural selection will shorten life.\r\n\r\n[1] See his _Biological Memoirs._ Oxford, 1888.\r\n\r\n83\r\n\r\nWeismann contends against the transmission of acquired characters\r\nas being unproved.[1] He bases the appearance of death on\r\nvariations in the reproductive cells, encouraged by the ceaseless\r\naction of natural selection, which led to a differentiation into\r\nperishable somatic cells and immortal reproductive cells. The\r\ntime-limit of any particular organism ultimately depends upon the\r\nnumber of somatic cell-generations and the duration of each\r\ngeneration. These quantities are \"predestined in the germ itself\"\r\nwhich gives rise to each individual. \"The existence of immortal\r\nmetazoan organisms is conceivable,\" but their capacity for\r\nexistence is influenced by conditions of the external world; this\r\nrenders necessary the process of adaptation. In fact, in the\r\ndifferentiation of somatic from reproductive cells, material was\r\nprovided upon which natural selection could operate to shorten or\r\nto lengthen the life of the individual in accordance with the\r\nneeds of the species. The soma is in a sense \"a secondary\r\nappendage of the real bearer of life--the reproductive cells.\" The\r\nsomatic cells probably lost their immortal qualities, on this\r\nimmortality becoming useless to the species. Their mortality may\r\nhave been a mere consequence of their differentiation (loc. cit.,\r\np. 140), itself due to natural selection. \"Natural death was\r\nnot,\" in fact, \"introduced from absolute intrinsic necessity\r\ninherent in the nature of living matter, but on grounds of\r\nutility,\r\n\r\n[1] Biological Memoirs, p. 142.\r\n\r\n84\r\n\r\nthat is from necessities which sprang up, not from the general\r\nconditions of life, but from those special conditions which\r\ndominate the life of multicellular organisms.\"\r\n\r\nOn the inherent immortality of life, Weismann finally states:\r\n\"Reproduction is, in truth, an essential attribute of living\r\nmatter, just as the growth which gives rise to it.... Life is\r\ncontinuous, and not periodically interrupted: ever since its\r\nfirst appearance upon the Earth in the lowest organism, it has\r\ncontinued without break; the forms in which it is manifest have\r\nalone undergone change. Every individual alive today--even the\r\nhighest--is to be derived in an unbroken line from the first and\r\nlowest forms.\" [1]\r\n\r\nAt the present day the view is very prevalent that the soma of\r\nhigher organisms is, in a sense, but the carrier for a period of\r\nthe immortal reproductive cells (Ray Lankester)[2]--an appendage\r\ndue to adaptation, concerned in their supply, protection, and\r\ntransmission. And whether we regard the time-limit of its\r\nfunctions as due to external constraints, recurrently acting till\r\ntheir effects become hereditary, or to variations more directly\r\nof internal origin, encouraged by natural selection, we see in\r\nold age and death phenomena ultimately brought about in obedience\r\nto the action of an environment. These are not inherent in the\r\nproperties of living matter. But, in spite\r\n\r\n[1] Loc. cit., p. 159\r\n\r\n[2] Geddes and Thomson, The Evolution of Sex, chap. xviii.\r\n\r\n85\r\n\r\nof its mortality, the body remains a striking manifestation of\r\nthe progressiveness of the organism, for to this it must be\r\nascribed. To it energy is available which is denied to the\r\nprotozoon. Ingenious adaptations to environment are more\r\nespecially its privilege. A higher manifestation, however, was\r\npossible, and was found in the development of mind. This, too, is\r\na servant of the cell, as the genii of the lamp. Through it\r\nenergy is available which is denied to the body. This is the\r\nmasterpiece of the cell. Its activity dates, as it were, but from\r\nyesterday, and today it inherits the most diverse energies of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nTaking this view of organic succession, we may liken the\r\nindividual to a particle vibrating for a moment and then coming\r\nto rest, but sweeping out in its motion one wave in the\r\ncontinuous organic vibration travelling from the past into the\r\nfuture. But as this vibration is one spreading with increased\r\nenergy from each vibrating particle, its propagation involves a\r\ncontinual accelerated inflow of energy from the surrounding\r\nmedium, a dynamic condition unknown in periodic effects\r\ntransmitted by inanimate actions, and, indeed, marking the\r\nfundamental difference between the dynamic attitudes of the\r\nanimate and inanimate.\r\n\r\nWe can trace the periodic succession of individuals on a diagram\r\nof activity with some advantage. Considering, first, the case of\r\nthe unicellular organism reproducing by subdivision and recalling\r\nthat conditions, definite and inevitable, oppose a limit to the\r\nrate of growth, or, for our\r\n\r\n86\r\n\r\npresent purpose, rate of consumption of energy, we proceed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n{Fig. 1}\r\n\r\nAlong a horizontal axis units of time are measured; along a\r\nvertical axis units of energy. Then the life-history of the\r\namoeba, for example, appears as a line such as A in Fig. 1.\r\nDuring the earlier stages of its growth the rate of absorption of\r\nenergy is small; so that in the unit interval of time, t, the\r\nsmall quantity of energy, e1, is absorbed. As life advances, the\r\nactivity of the organism augments, till finally this rate attains\r\na maximum, when e2 units of energy are consumed in the unit of\r\ntime.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Reference to p. 76, where the organic system is treated as\r\npurely mechanical, may help readers to understand what is\r\ninvolved in this curve. The solar engine may, unquestionably,\r\nhave its activity defined by such a curve. The organism is,\r\nindeed, more complex; but neither this fact nor our ignorance of\r\nits mechanism, affects the principles which justify the diagram.\r\n\r\n87\r\n\r\nOn this diagram reproduction, on the part of the organism, is\r\nrepresented by a line which repeats the curvature of the parent\r\norganism originating at such a point as P in the path of the\r\nlatter, when the rate of consumption of energy has become\r\nconstant. The organism A has now ceased to act as a unit. The\r\nproducts of fission each carry on the vital development of\r\n\r\n{Fig. 2}\r\n\r\nthe species along the curve B, which may be numbered (2), to\r\nsignify that it represents the activity of two individuals, and\r\nso on, the numbering advancing in geometrical progression. The\r\nparticular curvature adopted in the diagram is, of course,\r\nimaginary; but it is not of an indeterminate nature. Its course\r\nfor any species is a characteristic of fundamental physical\r\nimportance, regarding the part played in nature by the particular\r\norganism.\r\n\r\n88\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 is represented the path of a primitive multicellular\r\norganism before the effects of competition produced or fostered\r\nits mortality. The lettering of Fig. 1 applies; the successive\r\nreproductive acts are marked P1, P2; Q1, Q2, etc., in the paths\r\nof the successive individuals.\r\n\r\n{Fig. 3}\r\n\r\nThe next figure (Fig. 3) diagrammatically illustrates death in\r\norganic history. The path ever turns more and more from the axis\r\nof energy, till at length the point is reached when no more\r\nenergy is available; a tangent to the curve at this point is at\r\nright angles to the axis of energy and parallel to the time axis.\r\nThe death point is reached, and however great a length we measure\r\nalong the axis of time, no further consumption of energy is\r\n\r\n89\r\n\r\nindicated by the path of the organism. Drawing the line beyond\r\nthe death point is meaningless for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that while the progress of animate nature finds\r\nits representation on this diagram by lines sloping _upwards_ from\r\nleft to right, the course of events in inanimate nature--for\r\nexample, the history of the organic configuration after death, or\r\n\r\n{Fig. 4}\r\n\r\nthe changes progressing--let us say, in the solar system, or in\r\nthe process of a crystallisation, would appear as lines sloping\r\ndownwards from left to right.\r\n\r\nWhatever our views on the origin of death may be, we have to\r\nrecognise a periodicity of functions in the life-history of the\r\nsuccessive individuals of the present day; and whether or not we\r\ntrace this directly or indirectly to\r\n\r\n90\r\n\r\na sort of interference with the rising wave of life, imposed by\r\nthe activity of a series of derived units, each seeking energy,\r\nand in virtue of its adaptation each being more fitted to obtain\r\nit than its predecessor, or even leave the idea of interference\r\nout of account altogether in the origination or perpetuation of\r\ndeath, the truth of the diagram (Fig. 4) holds in so far as it\r\nmay be supposed to graphically represent the dynamic history of\r\nthe individual. The point chosen on the curve for the origination\r\nof a derived unit is only applicable to certain organisms, many\r\nreproducing at the very close of life. A chain of units are\r\nsupposed here represented.[1]\r\n\r\nTHE LENGTH OF LIFE\r\n\r\nIf we lay out waves as above to a common scale of time for\r\ndifferent species, the difference of longevity is shown in the\r\ngreater or less number of vibrations executed in a given time,\r\n_i.e._ in greater or less \"frequency.\" We cannot indeed draw the\r\ncurvature correctly, for this would necessitate a knowledge which\r\nwe have not of the activity of the organism at different periods\r\nof its life-history, and so neither can we plot the direction of\r\nthe organic line of propagation with respect to the\r\n\r\n[1] Projecting upon the axes of time and energy any one complete\r\nvibration, as in Fig. 4, the total energy consumed by the\r\norganism during life is the length E on the axis of energy, and\r\nits period of life is the length T on the time-axis. The mean\r\nactivity is the quotient E/T.\r\n\r\n91\r\n\r\naxes of reference as this involves a knowledge of the mean\r\nactivity.[1]\r\n\r\nThe group of curves which follow, relating to typical animals\r\npossessing very different activities (Fig. 5), are therefore\r\nentirely diagrammatic, except in respect to the approximate\r\n\r\n{Fig. 5}\r\n\r\nlongevity of the organisms. (1) might represent an animal of the\r\nlength of life and of the activity of Man; (2), on the same scale\r\nof longevity,\r\n\r\n[1] In the relative food-supply at various periods of life the\r\ncurvature is approximately determinable.\r\n\r\n92\r\n\r\none of the smaller mammals; and (3), the life-history of a cold\r\nblooded animal living to a great age; _e.g._ certain of the\r\nreptilia.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that to conditions of structural development,\r\nunder the influence of natural selection, the question of longer\r\nor shorter life is in a great degree referable. Thus, development\r\nalong lines of large growth will tend to a slow rate of\r\nreproduction from the simple fact that unlimited energy to supply\r\nabundant reproduction is not procurable, whatever we may assume\r\nas to the strength or cunning exerted by the individual in its\r\nefforts to obtain its supplies. On the other hand, development\r\nalong lines of small growth, in that reproduction is less costly,\r\nwill probably lead to increased rate of reproduction. It is, in\r\nfact, matter of general observation that in the case of larger\r\nanimals the rate of reproduction is generally slower than in the\r\ncase of smaller animals. But the rate of reproduction might be\r\nexpected to have an important influence in determining the\r\nparticular periodicity of the organism. Were we to depict in the\r\nlast diagram, on the same time-scale as Man, the vibrations of\r\nthe smaller and shorter-lived living things, we would see but a\r\nstraight line, save for secular variations in activity,\r\nrepresenting the progress of the species in time: the tiny\r\nthrills of its units lost in comparison with the yet brief period\r\nof Man.\r\n\r\nThe interdependence of the rate of reproduction and\r\n\r\n93\r\n\r\nthe duration of the individual is, indeed, very probably revealed\r\nin the fact that short-lived animals most generally reproduce\r\nthemselves rapidly and in great abundance, and vice versa. In\r\nmany cases where this appears contradicted, it will be found that\r\nthe young are exposed to such dangers that but few survive (_e.g._\r\nmany of the reptilia, etc.), and so the rate of reproduction is\r\nactually slow.\r\n\r\nDeath through the periodic rigour of the inanimate environment\r\ncalls forth phenomena very different from death introduced or\r\nfavoured by competition. A multiplicity of effects simulative of\r\ndeath occur. Organisms will, for example, learn to meet very\r\nrigorous conditions if slowly introduced, and not permanent. A\r\ntransitory period of want can be tided over by contrivance. The\r\nlily withdrawing its vital forces into the bulb, protected from\r\nthe greatest extremity of rigour by seclusion in the Earth; the\r\ntrance of the hibernating animal; are instances of such\r\ncontrivances.\r\n\r\nBut there are organisms whose life-wave truly takes up the\r\nperiodicity of the Earth in its orbit. Thus the smaller animals\r\nand plants, possessing less resources in themselves, die at the\r\napproach of winter, propagating themselves by units which,\r\nwhether egg or seed, undergo a period of quiescence during the\r\nseason of want. In these quiescent units the energy of the\r\norganism is potential, and the time-energy function is in\r\nabeyance. This condition is, perhaps, foreshadowed in the\r\nencyst-\r\n\r\n94\r\n\r\nment of the amoeba in resistance to drought. In most cases of\r\nhibernation the time-energy function seems maintained at a loss\r\nof potential by the organism, a diminished vital consumption of\r\nenergy being carried on at the expense of the stored energy of\r\nthe tissues. So, too, even among the largest organisms there will\r\nbe a diminution of activity periodically inspired by\r\nclimatological conditions. Thus, wholly or in part, the activity\r\nof organisms is recurrently affected by the great energy--tides\r\nset up by the Earth's orbital motion.\r\n\r\n{Fig. 6}\r\n\r\nSimilarly in the phenomenon of sleep the organism responds to the\r\nEarth's axial periodicity, for in the interval of night a period\r\nof impoverishment has to be endured. Thus the diurnal waves of\r\nenergy also meet a response in the organism. These tides and\r\nwaves of activity would appear as larger and smaller ripples\r\n\r\n95\r\n\r\non the life-curve of the organism. But in some, in which life and\r\ndeath are encompassed in a day, this would not be so; and for the\r\nannual among plants, the seed rest divides the waves with lines\r\nof no activity (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThus, finally, we regard the organism as a dynamic phenomenon\r\npassing through periodic variations of intensity. The material\r\nsystems concerned in the transfer of the energy rise, flourish,\r\nand fall in endless succession, like cities of ancient dynasties.\r\nAt points of similar phase upon the waves the rate of consumption\r\nof energy is approximately the same; the functions, too, which\r\ndemand and expend the energy are of similar nature.\r\n\r\nThat the rhythm of these events is ultimately based on harmony in\r\nthe configuration and motion of the molecules within the germ\r\nseems an unavoidable conclusion. In the life of the individual\r\nrhythmic dynamic phenomena reappear which in some cases have no\r\nlonger a parallel in the external world, or under conditions when\r\nthe individual is no longer influenced by these external\r\nconditions.,, In many cases the periodic phenomena ultimately die\r\nout under new influences, like the oscillations of a body in a\r\nviscous medium; in others when they seem to be more deeply rooted\r\nin physiological conditions they persist.\r\n\r\nThe \"length of life is dependent upon the number\r\n\r\n[1] The _Descent of Man._\r\n\r\n96\r\n\r\nof generations of somatic cells which can succeed one another in\r\nthe course of a single life, and furthermore the number as well\r\nas the duration of each single cell-generation is predestined in\r\nthe germ itself.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOnly in the vague conception of a harmonising or formative\r\nstructural influence derived from the germ, perishing in each\r\ncell from internal causes, but handed from cell to cell till the\r\nformative influence itself degrades into molecular discords, does\r\nit seem possible to form any physical representation of the\r\nsuccessive events of life. The degradation of the molecular\r\nformative influence might be supposed involved in its frequent\r\ntransference according to some such dynamic actions as occur in\r\ninanimate nature. Thus, ultimately, to the waste within the cell,\r\nto the presence of a force retardative of its perpetual harmonic\r\nmotions, the death of the individual is to be ascribed. Perhaps\r\nin protoplasmic waste the existence of a universal death should\r\nbe recognised. It is here we seem to touch inanimate nature; and\r\nwe are led back to a former conclusion that the organism in its\r\nunconstrained state is to be regarded as a contrivance for\r\nevading the dynamic tendencies of actions in which lifeless\r\nmatter participates.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] Weismann, _Life and Death; Biological Memoirs_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n[2] In connection with the predestinating power and possible\r\ncomplexity of the germ, it is instructive to reflect on the very\r\ngreat molecular population of even the smallest spores--giving\r\nrise to very simple forms. Thus, the spores of the unicellular\r\nSchizomycetes are estimated to dimensions as low as 1/10,000 of a\r\nmillimetre in diameter (Cornil et Babes, _Les Batteries_, 1. 37).\r\nFrom Lord Kelvin's estimate of the number of molecules in water,\r\ncomprised within the length of a wave-length of yellow light\r\n(_The Size of Atoms_, Proc. R. I., vol. x., p. 185) it is\r\nprobable that such spores contain some 500,000 molecules, while\r\none hundred molecules range along a diameter.\r\n\r\n97\r\n\r\nTHE NUMERICAL ABUNDANCE OF LIFE\r\n\r\nWe began by seeking in various manifestations of life a dynamic\r\nprinciple sufficiently comprehensive to embrace its very various\r\nphenomena. This, to all appearance, found, we have been led to\r\nregard life, to a great extent, as a periodic dynamic phenomenon.\r\nFundamentally, in that characteristic of the contrivance, which\r\nleads it to respond favourably to transfer of energy, its\r\nenormous extension is due. It is probable that to its instability\r\nits numerical abundance is to be traced--for this, necessitating\r\nthe continual supply of all the parts already formed, renders\r\nlarge, undifferentiated growth, incompatible with the limited\r\nsupplies of the environment. These are fundamental conditions of\r\nabundant life upon the Earth.\r\n\r\nAlthough we recognise in the instability of living systems the\r\nunderlying reason for their numerical abundance, secondary\r\nevolutionary causes are at work. The most important of these is\r\nthe self-favouring nature of the phenomenon of reproduction. Thus\r\nthere is a tendency not only to favour reproductiveness, but\r\nearly reproductiveness, in the form of one prolific\r\nreproductive.\r\n\r\n98\r\n\r\nact, after which the individual dies.[1] Hence the wavelength of\r\nthe species diminishes, reproduction is more frequent, and\r\ncorrespondingly greater numbers come and go in an interval of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of the numerical abundance of life exists, as\r\nalready stated, in the conditions of nourishment. Energy is more\r\nreadily conveyed to the various parts of the smaller mass, and\r\nhence the lesser organisms will more actively functionate; and\r\nthis, as being the urging dynamic attitude, as well as that most\r\ngenerally favourable in the struggle, will multiply and favour\r\nsuch forms of life. On the other hand, however, these forms will\r\nhave less resource within themselves, and less power of\r\nendurance, so that they are only suitable to fairly uniform\r\nconditions of supply; they cannot survive the long continued want\r\nof winter, and so we have the seasonal abundance of summer. Only\r\nthe larger and more resistant organisms, whether animal or\r\nvegetable, will, in general, populate the Earth from year to\r\nyear. From this we may conclude that, but for the seasonal\r\nenergy-tides, the development of life upon the globe had gone\r\nalong very different lines from those actually followed. It is,\r\nindeed, possible that the evolution of the larger organisms would\r\nnot have occurred; there would have been no vacant place for\r\ntheir development, and a being so endowed as Man could hardly\r\n\r\n[1] Weismann, _The Duration of Life._\r\n\r\n99\r\n\r\nhave been evolved. We may, too, apply this reasoning elsewhere,\r\nand regard as highly probable, that in worlds which are without\r\nseasonal influences, the higher developments of life have not\r\nappeared; except they have been evolved under other conditions,\r\nwhen they might for a period persist. We have, indeed, only to\r\npicture to ourselves what the consequence of a continuance of\r\nsummer would be on insect life to arrive at an idea of the\r\nantagonistic influences obtaining in such worlds to the survival\r\nof larger organisms.\r\n\r\nIt appears that to the dynamic attitude of life in the first\r\nplace, and secondarily to the environmental conditions limiting\r\nundifferentiated growth, as well as to the action of heredity in\r\ntransmitting the reproductive qualities of the parent to the\r\noffspring, the multitudes of the pines, and the hosts of ants,\r\nare to be ascribed. Other causes are very certainly at work, but\r\nthese, I think, must remain primary causes.\r\n\r\nWe well know that the abundance of the ants and pines is not a\r\ntithe of the abundance around us visible and invisible. It is a\r\nvain endeavour to realise the countless numbers of our\r\nfellow-citizens upon the Earth; but, for our purpose, the\r\nrestless ants, and the pines solemnly quiet in the sunshine, have\r\nserved as types of animate things. In the pine the gates of the\r\norganic have been thrown open that the vivifying river of energy\r\nmay flow in. The ants and the butterflies sip for a brief moment\r\nof its waters, and again vanish into the\r\n\r\n100\r\n\r\ninorganic: life, love and death encompassed in a day.\r\n\r\nWhether the organism stands at rest and life comes to it on the\r\nmaterial currents of the winds and waters, or in the vibratory\r\nenergy of the æther; or, again, whether with restless craving it\r\nhurries hither and thither in search of it, matters nothing. The\r\none principle--the accelerative law which is the law of the\r\norganic--urges all alike onward to development, reproduction and\r\ndeath. But although the individual dies death is not the end; for\r\nlife is a rhythmic phenomenon. Through the passing ages the waves\r\nof life persist: waves which change in their form and in the\r\nfrequency to which they are attuned from one geologic period to\r\nthe next, but which still ever persist and still ever increase.\r\nAnd in the end the organism outlasts the generations of the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n101\r\n\r\nTHE BRIGHT COLOURS OF ALPINE FLOWERS [1]\r\n\r\nIT is admitted by all observers that many species of flowering\r\nplants growing on the higher alps of mountainous regions display\r\na more vivid and richer colour in their bloom than is displayed\r\nin the same species growing in the valleys. That this is actually\r\nthe case, and not merely an effect produced upon the observer by\r\nthe scant foliage rendering the bloom more conspicuous, has been\r\nshown by comparative microscopic examination of the petals of\r\nspecies growing on the heights and in the valleys. Such\r\nexamination has revealed that in many cases pigment granules are\r\nmore numerous in the individuals growing at the higher altitudes.\r\nThe difference is specially marked in Myosotis sylvatica,\r\nCampanula rotundifolia, Ranunculus sylvaticus, Galium cruciatum,\r\nand others. It is less marked in the case of Thymus serpyllum and\r\nGeranium sylvaticum; while in Rosa alpina and Erigeron alpinus no\r\ndifference is observable.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the following cases a difference of intensity of colour is,\r\naccording to Kerner (\"Pflanzenleben,\" 11. 504), especially\r\nnoticeable:-- _Agrostemma githago, Campanula\r\n\r\n[1] _Proc. Royal Dublin Society_, 1893.\r\n\r\n[2] G. Bonnier, quoted by De Varigny, _Experimental Evolution_,\r\np. 55.\r\n\r\n102\r\n\r\npusilla, Dianthus inodorus (silvestris), Gypsophila repens, Lotus\r\ncorniculatus, Saponaria ocymoides, Satureja hortensis, Taraxacumm\r\nofficinale, Vicia cracca, and Vicia sepium._\r\n\r\nTo my own observation this beautiful phenomenon has always\r\nappeared most obvious and impressive. It appears to have struck\r\nmany unprofessional observers. Helmholtz offers the explanation\r\nthat the vivid colours are the result of the brighter sunlight of\r\nthe heights. It has been said, too, that they are the direct\r\nchemical effects of a more highly ozonized atmosphere. The latter\r\nexplanation I am unable to refer to its author. The following\r\npages contain a suggestion on the matter, which occurred to me\r\nwhile touring, along with Henry H. Dixon, in the Linthal district\r\nof Switzerland last summer.[1]\r\n\r\nIf the bloom of these higher alpine flowers is especially\r\npleasing to our own æsthetic instincts, and markedly conspicuous\r\nto us as observers, why not also especially attractive and\r\nconspicuous to the insect whose mission it is to wander from\r\nflower to flower over the pastures? The answer to this question\r\ninvolves the hypothesis I would advance as accounting for the\r\nbright colours of high-growing individuals. In short, I believe a\r\nsatisfactory explanation is to be found in the conditions of\r\ninsect life in the higher alps.\r\n\r\nIn the higher pastures the summer begins late and\r\n\r\n[1] The summer of 1892.\r\n\r\n103\r\n\r\ncloses early, and even in the middle of summer the day closes in\r\nwith extreme cold, and the cold of night is only dispelled when\r\nthe sun is well up. Again, clouds cover the heights when all is\r\nclear below, and cold winds sweep over them when there is warmth\r\nand shelter in the valleys. With these rigorous conditions the\r\npollinating insects have to contend in their search for food, and\r\nthat when the rival attractions of the valleys below are so many.\r\nI believe it is these rigorous conditions which are indirectly\r\nresponsible for the bright colours of alpine flowers. For such\r\nconditions will bring about a comparative scarcity of insect\r\nactivity on the heights; and a scarcity or uncertainty in the\r\naction of insect agency in effecting fertilization will intensify\r\nthe competition to attract attention, and only the brightest\r\nblooms will be fertilized.[1]\r\n\r\nThis will be a natural selection of the brightest, or the\r\n\r\n[1] Grant Allen, I have recently learned, advances in _Science in\r\nArcady_ the theory that there is a natural selective cause\r\nfostering the bright blooms of alpines. The selective cause is,\r\nhowever, by him referred to the greater abundance of butterfly\r\nrelatively to bee fertilizers. The former, he says, display more\r\næsthetic instinct than bees. In the valley the bees secure the\r\nfertilization of all. I may observe that upon the Fridolins Alp\r\nall the fertilizers we observed were bees. I have always found\r\nbutterflies very scarce at altitudes of 7,000 to 8,000 feet. The\r\nalpine bees are very light in body, like our hive bee, and I do\r\nnot think rarefaction of the atmosphere can operate to hinder its\r\nascent to the heights, as Grant Allen suggests. The observations\r\non the death-rate of bees and butterflies on the glacier, to be\r\nreferred to presently, seem to negative such a hypothesis, and to\r\nshow that a large preponderance of bees over butterflies make\r\ntheir way to the heights.\r\n\r\n104\r\n\r\nbrightest will be the fittest, and this condition, along with the\r\ninfluence of heredity, will encourage a race of vivid flowers. On\r\nthe other hand, the more scant and uncertain root supply, and the\r\nsevere atmospheric conditions, will not encourage the grosser\r\nstruggle for existence which in the valleys is carried on so\r\neagerly between leaves and branches--the normal offensive and\r\ndefensive weapons of the plant--and so the struggle becomes\r\nrefined into the more æsthetic one of colour and brightness\r\nbetween flower and flower. Hence the scant foliage and vivid\r\nbloom would be at once the result of a necessary economy, and a\r\nresort to the best method of securing reproduction under the\r\ncircumstances of insect fertilizing agency. Or, in other words,\r\nwhile the luxuriant growth is forbidden by the conditions, and\r\nthus methods of offence and defence, based upon vigorous\r\ndevelopment, reduced in importance, it would appear that the\r\nstruggle is mainly referred to rivalry for insect preference. It\r\nis probable that this is the more economical manner of carrying\r\non the contest.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys we see on every side the struggle between the\r\nvegetative organs of the plant; the soundless battle among the\r\nleaves and branches. The blossom here is carried aloft on a\r\nslender stem, or else, taking but a secondary part in the\r\ncontest, it is relegated to obscurity (P1. XII.). Further up on\r\nthe mountains, where the conditions are more severe and the\r\nsupplies less abundant, the leaf and branch assume lesser\r\ndimensions, for they are costly weapons to provide and the\r\nelements are unfriendly\r\n\r\n105\r\n\r\nto their existence (Pl. XIII.). Still higher, approaching the\r\nclimatic limit of vegetable life, the struggle for existence is\r\nmainly carried on by the æsthetic rivalry of lowly but\r\nconspicuous blossoms.\r\n\r\nAs regards the conditions of insect life in the higher alps, it\r\ncame to my notice in a very striking manner that vast numbers of\r\nsuch bees and butterflies as venture up perish in the cold of\r\nnight time. It appears as if at the approach of dusk these are\r\nattracted by the gleam of the snow, and quitting the pastures,\r\nlose themselves upon the glaciers and firns, there to die in\r\nhundreds. Thus in an ascent of the Tödi from the Fridolinshüte we\r\ncounted in the early dawn sixty-seven frozen bees, twenty-nine\r\ndead butterflies, and some half-dozen moths on the Biferten\r\nGlacier and Firn. These numbers, it is to be remembered, only\r\nincluded those lying to either side of our way over the snow, so\r\nthat the number must have mounted up to thousands when integrated\r\nover the entire glacier and firn. Approaching the summit none\r\nwere found. The bees resembled our hive bee in appearance, the\r\nbutterflies resembled the small white variety common in our\r\ngardens, which has yellow and black upon its wings. One large\r\nmoth, striped across the abdomen, and measuring nearly two inches\r\nin length of body, was found. Upon our return, long after the\r\nsun's rays had grown strong, we observed some of the butterflies\r\nshowed signs of reanimation. We descended so quickly to avoid the\r\ninconvenience of the soft snow that we had time for no\r\n\r\n106\r\n\r\nclose observation on the frozen bees. But dead bees are common\r\nobjects upon the snows of the alps.\r\n\r\nThese remarks I noted down roughly while at Linthal last summer,\r\nbut quite recently I read in Natural Science[1] the following\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n\"Late Flowering Plants.--While we write, the ivy is in flower, and\r\nbees, wasps, and flies are jostling each other and struggling to\r\nfind standing-room on the sweet-smelling plant. How great must be\r\nthe advantage obtained by this plant through its exceptional\r\nhabit of flowering in the late autumn, and ripening its fruit in\r\nthe spring. To anyone who has watched the struggle to approach\r\nthe ivy-blossom at a time when nearly all other plants are bare,\r\nit is evident that, as far as transport of pollen and\r\ncross-fertilization go, the plant could not flower at a more\r\nsuitable time. The season is so late that most other plants are\r\nout of flower, but yet it is not too late for many insects to be\r\nbrought out by each sunny day, and each insect, judging by its\r\nbehaviour, must be exceptionally hungry.\r\n\r\n\"Not only has the ivy the world to itself during its flowering\r\nseason, but it delays to ripen its seed till the spring, a time\r\nwhen most other plants have shed their seed, and most edible\r\nfruits have been picked by the birds. Thus birds wanting fruit in\r\nthe spring can obtain little but ivy, and how they appreciate the\r\nivy berry is evident\r\n\r\n[1] For December, 1892, vol. i., p. 730.\r\n\r\n107\r\n\r\nby the purple stains everywhere visible within a short distance\r\nof the bush.\"\r\n\r\nThese remarks suggest that the ivy adopts the converse attitude\r\ntowards its visitors to that forced upon the alpine flower. The\r\nivy bloom is small and inconspicuous, but then it has the season\r\nto itself, and its inconspicuousness is no disadvantage, _i.e._\r\nif one plant was more conspicuous than its neighbours, it would\r\nnot have any decided advantage where the pollinating insect is\r\nabundant and otherwise unprovided for. Its dark-green berries in\r\nspring, which I would describe as very inconspicuous, have a\r\nsimilar advantage in relation to the necessities of bird life.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of M. C. Flahault must be noticed. This\r\nnaturalist grew seeds of coloured flowers which had ripened in\r\nParis, part in Upsala, and part in Paris; and seed which had\r\nripened in Upsala, part at Paris, and part at Upsala. The flowers\r\nopening in the more northern city were in most cases the\r\nbrighter.[1] If this observation may be considered indisputable,\r\nas appears to be the case, the question arises, Are we to regard\r\nthis as a direct effect of the more rigorous climate upon the\r\ndevelopment of colouring matter on the blooms opening at Upsala?\r\nIf we suppose an affirmative answer, the theory of direct effect\r\nby sun brightness must I think be abandoned. But I venture to\r\nthink that the explanation of the Upsala\r\n\r\n[1] Quoted by De Varigny, _Experimental Evolution_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n108\r\n\r\nexperiment is not to be found in direct climatic influence upon\r\nthe colour, but in causes which lie deeper, and involve some\r\nfactors deducible from biological theory.\r\n\r\nThe organism, as a result of the great facts of heredity and of\r\nthe survival of the fittest, is necessarily a system which\r\ngathers experience with successive generations; and the principal\r\nlesson ever being impressed upon it by external events is\r\neconomy. Its success depends upon the use it makes of its\r\nopportunities for the reception of energy and the economy\r\nattained in disposing of what is gained.\r\n\r\nWith regard to using the passing opportunity the entire seasonal\r\ndevelopment of life is a manifestation of this attitude, and the\r\nfleetness, agility, etc., of higher organisms are developments in\r\nthis direction. The higher vegetable organism is not locomotory,\r\nsave in the transferences of pollen and seed, for its food comes\r\nto it, and the necessary relative motion between food and\r\norganism is preserved in the quick motion of radiated energy from\r\nthe sun and the slower motion of the winds on the surface of the\r\nearth. But, even so, the vegetable organism must stand ever ready\r\nand waiting for its supplies. Its molecular parts must be ready\r\nto seize the prey offered to it, somewhat as the waiting spider\r\nthe fly. Hence, the plant stands ready; and every cloud with\r\nmoving shadow crossing the fields handicaps the shaded to the\r\nbenefit of the unshaded plant in the adjoining field. The open\r\nbloom\r\n\r\n109\r\n\r\nis a manifestation of the generally expectant attitude of the\r\nplant, but in relation to reproduction.\r\n\r\nAs regards economy, any principle of maximum economy, where many\r\nfunctions have to be fulfilled, will, we may very safely predict,\r\ninvolve as far as possible mutual helpfulness in the processes\r\ngoing on. Thus the process of the development towards meeting any\r\nparticular external conditions, A, suppose, will, if possible,\r\ntend to forward the development towards meeting conditions B; so\r\nthat, in short, where circumstances of morphology and physiology\r\nare favourable, the ideally economical system will be attained\r\nwhen in place of two separate processes, a, ß, the one process y,\r\ncheaper than a + ß, suffices to advance development\r\nsimultaneously in both the directions A and B. The economy is as\r\nobvious as that involved in \"killing two birds with the one\r\nstone\"--if so crude a simile is permissible--and it is to be\r\nexpected that to foster such economy will be the tendency of\r\nevolution in all organic systems subjected to restraints as those\r\nwe are acquainted with invariably are.\r\n\r\nSuch economy might be simply illustrated by considering the case\r\nof a reservoir of water elevated above two hydraulic motors, so\r\nthat the elevated mass of water possessed gravitational\r\npotential. The available energy here represents the stored-up\r\nenergy in the organism. How best may the water be conveyed to the\r\ntwo motors [the organic systems reacting towards conditions A and\r\nB] so\r\n\r\n110\r\n\r\nthat as little energy as possible is lost in transit? If the\r\nmotors are near together it is most economical to use the one\r\nconduit, which will distribute the requisite supply of water to\r\nboth. If the motors are located far asunder it will be most\r\neconomical to lay separate conduits. There is greatest economy in\r\nmeeting a plurality of functions by the same train of\r\nphysiological processes where this is consistent with meeting\r\nother demands necessitated by external or internal conditions.\r\n\r\nBut an important and obvious consequence arises in the supply of\r\nthe two motors from the one conduit. We cannot work one motor\r\nwithout working the other. If we open a valve in the conduit both\r\nmotors start into motion and begin consuming the energy stored in\r\nthe tank. And although they may both under one set of conditions\r\nbe doing useful and necessary work, in some other set of\r\nconditions it may be needless for both to be driven.\r\n\r\nThis last fact is an illustration of a consideration which must\r\nenter into the phenomenon which an eminent biologist speaks of as\r\nphysiological or unconscious \"memory,\"[1] For the development of\r\nthe organism from the ovum is but the starting of a train of\r\ninterdependent events of a complexity depending upon the\r\nexperience of the past.\r\n\r\n[1] Ewald Hering, quoted by Ray Lankaster, _The Advancement of\r\nScience_, p. 283.\r\n\r\n111\r\n\r\nIn short, we may suppose the entire development of the plant,\r\ntowards meeting certain groups of external conditions,\r\nphysiologically knit together according as Nature tends to\r\nassociate certain groups of conditions. Thus, in the case in\r\npoint, climatic rigour and scarcity of pollinating agency will\r\never be associated; and in the long experience of the past the\r\nmost economical physiological attitude towards both is, we may\r\nsuppose, adopted; so that the presence of one condition excites\r\nthe apparent unconscious memory of the other. In reality the\r\nprocess of meeting the one condition involves the process and\r\ndevelopment for meeting the other.\r\n\r\nAnd this consideration may be extended very generally to such\r\norganisms as can survive under the same associated natural\r\nconditions, for the history of evolution is so long, and the\r\npower of locomotion so essential to the organism at some period\r\nin its life history, that we cannot philosophically assume a\r\nlocal history for members of a species even if widely severed\r\ngeographically at the present day. At some period in the past\r\nthen, it is very possible that the individuals today thriving at\r\nParis, acquired the experience called out at Upsala. The\r\nperfection of physiological memory inspires no limit to the date\r\nat which this may have occurred--possibly the result of a\r\nsuccession of severe seasons at Paris; possibly the result of\r\nmigrations --and the seed of many flowering plants possess means\r\nof migration only inferior to those possessed by the flying and\r\nswimming animals. But, again, possibly the experi-\r\n\r\n112\r\n\r\nence was acquired far back in the evolutionary history of the\r\nflower.[1]\r\n\r\nBut a further consideration arises. Not only at each moment in\r\nthe life of the individual must maximum income and most judicious\r\nexpenditure be considered, but in its whole life history, and\r\neven over the history of its race, the efficiency must tend to be\r\na maximum. This principle is even carried so far that when\r\nnecessary it leads to the death of the individual, as in the case\r\nof those organisms which, having accomplished the reproductive\r\nact, almost immediately expire. This view of nature may be\r\nrepellent, but it is, nevertheless, evident that we are parts of\r\na system which ruthlessly sacrifices the individual on general\r\ngrounds of economy. Thus, if the curve which defines the mean\r\nrate of reception of energy of all kinds at different periods in\r\nthe life of the organism be opposed by a second curve, drawn\r\nbelow the axis along which time is measured, representing the\r\nmean rate of expenditure of energy on development, reproduction,\r\netc. (Fig. 7), this latter curve, which is, of course,\r\n\r\n[1] The blooms of self-fertilising, and especially of\r\ncleistogamic plants (_e.g._ Viola), are examples of unconscious\r\nmemory, or unconscious \"association of ideas\" leading to the\r\ndevelopment of organs now functionless. The _Pontederia crassipes_\r\nof the Amazon, which develops its floating bladders when grown in\r\nwater, but aborts them rapidly when grown on land, and seems to\r\nretain this power of adaptation to the environment for an\r\nindefinite period of time, must act in each case upon an\r\nunconscious memory based upon past experience. Many other cases\r\nmight be cited.\r\n\r\n113\r\n\r\nphysiologically dependent on the former, must be of such a nature\r\nfrom its origin to its completion in death, that the condition is\r\nrealized of the most economical rate of expenditure at each\r\nperiod of life.[1] The rate of expenditure of energy at any\r\nperiod of life is, of course, in such a curve defined by the\r\nslope of the curve towards the axis of time at the period in\r\nquestion; but this particular slope _must be led to by a previous\r\npart of the curve, and involves its past and future course to a\r\nvery great extent_.\r\n\r\n{Fig. 7}\r\n\r\nThere will, therefore, be impressed upon the\r\norganism by the factors of evolution a unified course of\r\neconomical expenditure completed only by its death, and which\r\nwill give to the developmental progress of the individual its\r\nprophetic character.\r\n\r\nIn this way we look to the unified career of each organic unit,\r\nfrom its commencement in the ovum to the day\r\n\r\n[1] See _The Abundance of Life_.\r\n\r\n114\r\n\r\nwhen it is done with vitality, for that preparation for momentous\r\norganic events which is in progress throughout the entire course\r\nof development; and to the economy involved in the welding of\r\nphysiological processes for the phenomenon of physiological\r\nmemory, wherein we see reflected, as it were, in the development\r\nof the organism, the association of inorganic restraints\r\noccurring in nature which at some previous period impressed\r\nitself upon the plastic organism. We may picture the seedling at\r\nUpsala, swayed by organic memory and the inherited tendency to an\r\neconomical preparation for future events, gradually developing\r\ntowards the æsthetic climax of its career. In some such manner\r\nonly does it appear possible to account for the prophetic\r\ndevelopment of organisms, not alone to be observed in the alpine\r\nflowers, but throughout nature.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, finally, to the effects of natural selection and to\r\nactions defined by general principles involved in biology, I\r\nwould refer for explanation of the manner in which flowers on the\r\nAlps develop their peculiar beauty.\r\n\r\n115\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN GENESIS\r\n\r\nOUR ancestors regarded mountainous regions with feelings of\r\nhorror, mingled with commiseration for those whom an unkindly\r\ndestiny had condemned to dwell therein. We, on the other hand,\r\nfind in the contemplation of the great alps of the Earth such\r\npeaceful and elevated thoughts, and such rest to our souls, that\r\nit is to those very solitudes we turn to heal the wounds of ife.\r\nIt is difficult to explain the cause of this very different point\r\nof view. It is probably, in part, to be referred to that cloud of\r\nsuperstitious horror which, throughout the Middle Ages, peopled\r\nthe solitudes with unknown terrors; and, in part, to the\r\nasceticism which led the pious to regard the beauty and joy of\r\nlife as snares to the soul's well-being. In those eternal\r\nsolitudes where the overwhelming forces of Nature are most in\r\nevidence, an evil principle must dwell or a dragon's dreadful\r\nbrood must find a home.\r\n\r\nBut while in our time the aesthetic aspect of the hills appeals\r\nto all, there remains in the physical history of the mountains\r\nmuch that is lost to those who have not shared in the scientific\r\nstudies of alpine structure and genesis. They lose a past history\r\nwhich for interest com-\r\n\r\n116\r\n\r\npetes with anything science has to tell of the changes of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nGreat as are the physical features of the mountains compared with\r\nthe works of Man, and great as are the forces involved compared\r\nwith those we can originate or control, the loftiest ranges are\r\nsmall contrasted with the dimensions of the Earth. It is well to\r\nbear this in mind. I give here (Pl. XV.) a measured drawing\r\nshowing a sector cut from a sphere of 50 cms. radius; so much of\r\nit as to exhibit the convergence of its radial boundaries which\r\nif prolonged will meet at the centre. On the same scale as the\r\nradius the diagram shows the highest mountains and the deepest\r\nocean. The average height of the land and the average depth of\r\nthe ocean are also exhibited. We see how small a movement of the\r\ncrust the loftiest elevation of the Himalaya represents and what\r\na little depression holds the ocean.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is not by any means easy to explain the genesis\r\nof those small elevations and depressions. It would lead us far\r\nfrom our immediate subject to discuss the various theoretical\r\nviews which have been advanced to account for the facts. The idea\r\nthat mountain folds, and the lesser rugosities of the Earth's\r\nsurface, arose in a wrinkling of the crust under the influence of\r\ncooling and skrinkage of the subcrustal materials, is held by\r\nmany eminent geologists, but not without dissent from others.\r\n\r\nThe most striking observational fact connected with mountain\r\nstructure is that, without exception, the ranges\r\n\r\n117\r\n\r\nof the Earth are built essentially of sedimentary rocks: that is\r\nof rocks which have been accumulated at some remote past time\r\nbeneath the surface of the ocean. A volcanic core there may\r\nsometimes be--probably an attendant or consequence of the\r\nuplifting--or a core of plutonic igneous rocks which has arisen\r\nunder the same compressive forces which have bowed and arched the\r\nstrata from their original horizontal position. It is not\r\nuncommon to meet among unobservant people those who regard all\r\nmountain ranges as volcanic in origin. Volcanoes, however, do not\r\nbuild mountain ranges. They break out as more or less isolated\r\ncones or hills. Compare the map of the Auvergne with that of\r\nSwitzerland; the volcanoes of South Italy with the Apennines.\r\nSuch great ranges as those which border with triple walls the\r\nwest coast of North America are in no sense volcanic: nor are the\r\nPyrenees, the Caucasus, or the Himalaya. Volcanic materials are\r\npoured out from the summits of the Andes, but the range itself is\r\nbuilt up of folded sediments on the same architecture as the\r\nother great ranges of the Earth.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting an explanation of the origin of the mountains\r\nwe must first become more closely acquainted with the phenomena\r\nattending mountain elevation.\r\n\r\nAt the present day great accumulations of sediment are taking\r\nplace along the margins of the continents where the rivers reach\r\nthe ocean. Thus, the Gulf of Mexico receiving the sediment of the\r\nMississippi and Rio Grande;\r\n\r\n118\r\n\r\nthe northeast coast of South America receiving the sediments of\r\nthe Amazons; the east coast of Asia receiving the detritus of the\r\nChinese rivers; are instances of such areas of deposition. Year\r\nby year, century by century, the accumulation progresses, and as\r\nit grows the floor of the sea sinks under the load. Of the\r\nyielding of the crust under the burthen of the sediments we are\r\nassured; for otherwise the many miles of vertically piled strata\r\nwhich are uplifted to our view in the mountains, never could have\r\nbeen deposited in the coastal seas of the past. The flexure and\r\nsinking of the crust are undeniable realities.\r\n\r\nSuch vast subsiding areas are known as geosynclines. From the\r\naccumulated sediments of the geosynclines the mountain ranges of\r\nthe past have in every case originated; and the mountains of the\r\nfuture will assuredly arise and lofty ranges will stand where now\r\nthe ocean waters close over the collecting sediments. Every\r\nmountain range upon the Earth enforces the certainty of this\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nThe mountain-forming movement takes place after a certain great\r\ndepth of sediment is collected. It is most intense where the\r\nthickness of deposit is greatest. We see this when we examine the\r\nstructure of our existing mountain ranges. At either side where\r\nthe sediments thin out, the disturbance dies away, till we find\r\nthe comparatively shallow and undisturbed level sediments which\r\nclothe the continental surface.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the connection between the deposition and\r\n\r\n119\r\n\r\nthe subsequent upheaval, _the element of great depth of\r\naccumulation seems a necessary condition and must evidently enter\r\nas a factor into the Physical Processes involved_. The mountain\r\nrange can only arise where the geosyncline is deeply filled by\r\nlong ages of sedimentation.\r\n\r\nDana's description of the events attending mountain building is\r\nimpressive:\r\n\r\n\"A mountain range of the common type, like that to which the\r\nAppalachians belong, is made out of the sedimentary formations of\r\na long preceding era; beds that were laid down conformably, and\r\nin succession, until they had reached the needed thickness; beds\r\nspreading over a region tens of thousands of square miles in\r\narea. The region over which sedimentary formations were in\r\nprogress in order to make, finally, the Appalachian range,\r\nreached from New York to Alabama, and had a breadth of 100 to 200\r\nmiles, and the pile of horizontal beds along the middle was\r\n40,000 feet in depth. The pile for the Wahsatch Mountains was\r\n60,000 feet thick, according to King. The beds for the\r\nAppalachians were not laid down in a deep ocean, but in shallow\r\nwaters, where a gradual subsidence was in progress; and they at\r\nlast, when ready for the genesis, lay in a trough 40,000 feet\r\ndeep, filling the trough to the brim. It thus appears that epochs\r\nof mountain-making have occurred only after long intervals of\r\nquiet in the history of a continent.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Dana, _Manual of Geology_, third edition, p. 794\r\n\r\n120\r\n\r\nOn the western side of North America the work of\r\nmountain-building was, indeed, on the grandest scale. For long\r\nages and through a succession of geological epochs, sedimentation\r\nhad proceeded so that the accumulations of Palaeozoic and\r\nMesozoic times had collected in the geosyncline formed by their\r\nown ever increasing weight. The site of the future Laramide range\r\nwas in late Cretaceous times occupied by some 50,000 feet of\r\nsedimentary deposits; but the limit had apparently been attained,\r\nand at this time the Laramide range, as well as its southerly\r\ncontinuation into the United States, the Rockies, had their\r\nbeginning. Chamberlin and Salisbury[1] estimate that the height\r\nof the mountains developed in the Laramide range at this time was\r\n20,000 feet, and that, owing to the further elevation which has\r\nsince taken place, from 32,000 to 35,000 feet would be their\r\npresent height if erosion had not reduced them. Thus on either\r\nside of the American continent we have the same forces at work,\r\nthrowing up mountain ridges where the sediments had formerly been\r\nshed into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThese great events are of a rhythmic character; the crust, as it\r\nwere, pulsating under the combined influences of sedimentation\r\nand denudation. The first involves downward movements under a\r\ngathering load, and ultimately a reversal of the movement to one\r\nof upheaval; the second factor, which throughout has been in\r\n\r\n[1] Chamberlin and Salisbury, _Geology_, 1906, iii., 163.\r\n\r\n121\r\n\r\noperation as creator of the sediments, then intervenes as an\r\nassailant of the newly-raised mountains, transporting their\r\nmaterials again to the ocean, when the rhythmic action is\r\nrestored to its first phase, and the age-long sequence of events\r\nmust begin all over again.\r\n\r\nIt has long been inferred that compressive stress in the crust\r\nmust be a primary condition of these movements. The wvork\r\nrequired to effect the upheavals must be derived from some\r\npreexisting source of energy. The phenomenon--intrinsically one of\r\nfolding of the crust--suggests the adjustment of the earth-crust\r\nto a lessening radius; the fact that great mountain-building\r\nmovements have simultaneously affected the entire earth is\r\ncertainly in favour of the view that a generally prevailing cause\r\nis at the basis of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe compressive stresses must be confined to the upper few miles\r\nof the crust, for, in fact, the downward increase of temperature\r\nand pressure soon confers fluid properties on the medium, and\r\nslow tangential compression results in hydrostatic pressure\r\nrather than directed stresses. Thus the folding visible in the\r\nmountain range, and the lateral compression arising therefrom,\r\nare effects confined to the upper parts of the crust.\r\n\r\nThe energy which uplifts the mountain is probably a surviving\r\npart of the original gravitational potential energy of the crust\r\nitself. It must be assumed that the crust in following downwards\r\nthe shrinking subcrustal magma, develops immense compressive\r\nstresses in\r\n\r\n122\r\n\r\nits materials, vast geographical areas being involved. When\r\nfolding at length takes place along the axis of the elongated\r\nsyncline of deposition, the stresses find relief probably for\r\nsome hundreds of miles, and the region of folding now becomes\r\ncompressed in a transverse direction. As an illustration, the\r\nLaramide range, according to Dawson, represents the reduction of\r\na surface-belt 50 miles wide to one of 25 miles. The marvellous\r\ntranslatory movements of crustal folds from south to north\r\narising in the genesis of the Swiss Alps, which recent research\r\nhas brought to light, is another example of these movements of\r\nrelief, which continue to take place perhaps for many millions of\r\nyears after they are initiated.\r\n\r\nThe result of this yielding of the crust is a buckling of the\r\nsurface which on the whole is directed upwards; but depression\r\nalso is an attendant, in many cases at least, on mountain\r\nupheaval. Thus we find that the ocean floor is depressed into a\r\nsyncline along the western coast of South America; a trough\r\nalways parallel to the ranges of the Andes. The downward\r\ndeflection of the crust is of course an outcome of the same\r\ncompressive stresses which elevate the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the yielding of the crust is always situated where\r\nthe sediments have accumulated to the greatest depth, has led to\r\nattempts from time to time of establishing a physical connexion\r\nbetween the one and the other. The best-known of these theories\r\nis that of Babbage and Herschel. This seeks the connexion in the\r\nrise of the\r\n\r\n123\r\n\r\ngeotherms into the sinking mass of sediment and the consequent\r\nincrease of temperature of the earth-crust beneath. It will be\r\nunderstood that as these isogeotherms, or levels at which the\r\ntemperature is the same, lie at a uniform distance from the\r\nsurface all over the Earth, unless where special variations of\r\nconductivity may disturb them, the introduction of material\r\npressed downwards from above must result in these materials\r\npartaking of the temperature proper to the depth to which they\r\nare depressed. In other words the geotherms rise into the sinking\r\nsediments, always, however, preserving their former average\r\ndistance from the surface. The argument is that as this process\r\nundoubtedly involves the heating up of that portion of the crust\r\nwhich the sediments have displaced downwards, the result must be\r\na local enfeeblement of the crust, and hence these areas become\r\nthose of least resistance to the stresses in the crust.\r\n\r\nWhen this theory is examined closely, we see that it only amounts\r\nto saying that the bedded rocks, which have taken the place of\r\nthe igneous materials beneath, as a part of the rigid crust of\r\nthe Earth, must be less able to withstand compressive stress than\r\nthe average crust. For there has been no absolute rise of the\r\ngeotherms, the thermal conductivities of both classes of\r\nmaterials differing but little. Sedimentary rock has merely taken\r\nthe place of average crust-rock, and is subjected to the same\r\naverage temperature and pressure prevailing in the surrounding\r\ncrust. But are there any grounds for the\r\n\r\n124\r\n\r\nassumption that the compressive resistance of a complex of\r\nsedimentary rocks is inferior to one of igneous materials? The\r\nmetamorphosed siliceous sediments are among the strongest rocks\r\nknown as regards resistance to compressive stress; and if\r\nlimestones have indeed plastic qualities, it must be remembered\r\nthat their average amount is only some 5 per cent. of the whole.\r\nAgain, so far as rise of temperature in the upper crust may\r\naffect the question, a temperature which will soften an average\r\nigneous rock will not soften a sedimentary rock, for the reason\r\nthat the effect of solvent denudation has been to remove those\r\nalkaline silicates which confer fusibility.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we take into account the radioactive content of\r\nthe sediments the matter assumes a different aspect.\r\n\r\nThe facts as to the general distribution of radioactive\r\nsubstances at the surface, and in rocks which have come from\r\nconsiderable depths in the crust, lead us to regard as certain\r\nthe widespread existence of heat-producing radioactive elements\r\nin the exterior crust of the Earth. We find, indeed, in this fact\r\nan explanation--at least in part--of the outflow of heat\r\ncontinually taking place at the surface as revealed by the rising\r\ntemperature inwards. And we conclude that there must be a\r\nthickness of crust amounting to some miles, containing the\r\nradioactive elements.\r\n\r\nSome of the most recent measurements of the quantities of radium\r\nand thorium in the rocks of igneous origin--_e.g._ granites,\r\nsyenites, diorites, basalts, etc., show that the\r\n\r\n125\r\n\r\nradioactive heat continually given out by such rocks amounts to\r\nabout one millionth part of 0.6 calories per second per cubic\r\nmetre of average igneous rock. As we have to account for the\r\nescape of about 0.0014 calorie[1] per square metre of the Earth's\r\nsurface per second (assuming the rise of temperature downwards,\r\n_i.e._ the \"gradient\" of temperature, to be one degree centigrade\r\nin 35 metres) the downward extension of such rocks might, _prima\r\nfacie_, be as much as 19 kilometres.\r\n\r\nAbout this calculation we have to observe that we assume the\r\naverage radioactivity of the materials with which we have dealt\r\nat the surface to extend uniformly all the way down, _i.e._ that\r\nour experiments reveal the average radioactivity of a radioactive\r\ncrust. There is much to be said for this assumption. The rocks\r\nwhich enter into the measurements come from all depths of the\r\ncrust. It is highly probable that the less silicious, _i.e._ the\r\nmore basic, rocks, mainly come from considerable depths; the more\r\nacid or silica-rich rocks, from higher levels in the crust. The\r\nradioactivity determined as the mean of the values for these two\r\nclasses of rock closely agrees with that found for intermediate\r\nrocks, or rocks containing an intermediate amount of silica.\r\nClarke contends that this last class of material probably\r\nrepresents the average composition of the Earth's crust so far as\r\nit has been explored by us.\r\n\r\n[1] The calorie referred to is the quantity of heat required to\r\nheat one gram of water, _i.e._ one cubic centimetre of\r\nwater--through one degree centigrade.\r\n\r\n126\r\n\r\nIt is therefore highly probable that the value found for the mean\r\nradioactivity of acid and basic rocks, or that found for\r\nintermediate rocks, truly represents the radioactive state of the\r\ncrust to a considerable depth. But it is easy to show that we\r\ncannot with confidence speak of the thickness of this crust as\r\ndeterminable by equating the heat outflow at the surface with the\r\nheat production of this average rock.\r\n\r\nThis appears in the failure of a radioactive layer, taken at a\r\nthickness of about 19-kilometres, to account for the deep-seated\r\nhigh temperatures which we find to be indicated by volcanic\r\nphenomena at many places on the surface. It is not hard to show\r\nthat the 19-kilometre layer would account for a temperature no\r\nhigher than about 270° >C. at its base.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this will be augmented beneath the sedimentary\r\ndeposits as we shall presently see; and that it is just in\r\nassociation with these deposits that deep-seated temperatures are\r\nmost in evidence at the surface; but still the result that the\r\nmaximum temperature beneath the crust in general attains a value\r\nno higher than 270° C. is hardly tenable. We conclude, then, that\r\nsome other source of heat exists beneath. This may be radioactive\r\nin origin and may be easily accounted for if the radioactive\r\nmaterials are more sparsely distributed at the base of the upper\r\ncrust. Or, again, the heat may be primeval or original heat,\r\nstill escaping from a cooling world. For our present purpose it\r\ndoes not much matter which view\r\n\r\n127\r\n\r\nwe adopt. But we must recognise that the calculated depth of 19\r\nkilometres of crust, possessing the average radioactivity of the\r\nsurface, is excessive; for, in fact, we are compelled by the\r\nfacts to recognise that some other source of heat exists\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nIf the observed surface gradient of temperature persisted\r\nuniformly downwards, at some 35 kilometres beneath the surface\r\nthere would exist temperatures (of about 1000° C.) adequate to\r\nsoften basic rocks. It is probable, however, that the gradient\r\ndiminishes downwards, and that the level at which such\r\ntemperatures exist lies rather deeper than this. It is,\r\ndoubtless, somewhat variable according to local conditions; nor\r\ncan we at all approximate closely to an estimate of the depth at\r\nwhich the fusion temperatures will be reached, for, in fact, the\r\nexistence of the radioactive layer very much complicates our\r\nestimates. In what follows we assume the depth of softening to\r\nlie at about 40 kilometres beneath the surface of the normal\r\ncrust; that is 25 miles down. It is to be observed that Prestwich\r\nand other eminent geologists, from a study of the facts of\r\ncrust-folding, etc., have arrived at similar estimates.[1] As a\r\nfurther assumption we are probably not far wrong if we assign to\r\nthe radioactive part of this crust a thickness of about 10 or 12\r\nkilometres; _i.e._ six or seven miles. This is necessarily a\r\nrough approximation only; but the conclusions at which\r\n\r\n[1] Prestwich, _Proc. Royal Soc._, xii., p. 158 _et seq._\r\n\r\n128\r\n\r\nwe shall arrive are reached in their essential features allowing\r\na wide latitude in our choice of data. We shall speak of this\r\npart of the crust as the normal radioactive layer.\r\n\r\nAn important fact is evolved from the mathematical investigation\r\nof the temperature conditions arising from the presence of such a\r\nradioactive layer. It is found that the greatest temperature, due\r\nto the radioactive heat everywhere evolved in the layer--_i.e._\r\nthe temperature at its base--is proportional to the square of the\r\nthickness of the layer. This fact has a direct bearing on the\r\ninfluence of radioactivity upon mountain elevation; as we shall\r\nnow find.\r\n\r\nThe normal radioactive layer of the Earth is composed of rocks\r\nextending--as we assume--approximately to a depth of 12 kilometres\r\n(7.5 miles). The temperature at the base of this layer due to the\r\nheat being continually evolved in it, is, say, t1°. Now, let us\r\nsuppose, in the trough of the geosyncline, and upon the top of\r\nthe normal layer, a deposit of, say, 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) of\r\nsediments is formed during a long period of continental\r\ndenudation. What is the effect of this on the temperature at the\r\nbase of the normal layer depressed beneath this load? The total\r\nthickness of radioactive rocks is now 22 kilometres. Accordingly\r\nwe find the new temperature t2°, by the proportion t1° : t2° ::\r\n12° : 22° That is, as 144 to 484. In fact, the temperature is more\r\nthan trebled. It is true we here assume the radioactivity of the\r\nsediments\r\n\r\n129\r\n\r\nand of the normal crust to be the same. The sediments are,\r\nhowever, less radioactive in the proportion of 4 to 3.\r\nNevertheless the effects of the increased thickness will be\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nNow this remarkable increase in the temperature arises entirely\r\nfrom the condition attending the radioactive heating; and\r\ninvolves something _additional_ to the temperature conditions\r\ndetermined by the mere depression and thickening of the crust as\r\nin the Babbage-Herschel theory. The latter theory only involves a\r\n_shifting_ of the temperature levels (or geotherms) into the\r\ndeposited materials. The radioactive theory involves an actual\r\nrise in the temperature at any distance from the surface; so that\r\n_the level in the crust at which the rocks are softened is nearer\r\nto the surface in the geosynclines than it is elsewhere in the\r\nnormal crust_ (Pl. XV, p. 118).\r\n\r\nIn this manner the rigid part of the crust is reduced in\r\nthickness where the great sedimentary deposits have collected. A\r\nten-kilometre layer of sediment might result in reducing the\r\neffective thickness of the crust by 30 per cent.; a\r\nfourteen-kilometre layer might reduce it by nearly 50 per cent.\r\nEven a four-kilometre deposit might reduce the effective\r\nresistance of the crust to compressive forces, by 10 per cent.\r\n\r\nSuch results are, of course, approximate only. They show that as\r\nthe sediments grow in depth there is a rising of the geotherm of\r\nplasticity--whatever its true temperature may be--gradually\r\nreducing the thickness of that part\r\n\r\n130\r\n\r\nof the upper crust which is bearing the simultaneously increasing\r\ncompressive stresses. Below this geotherm long-continued stress\r\nresolves itself into hydrostatic pressure; above it (there is, of\r\ncourse, no sharp line of demarcation) the crust accumulates\r\nelastic energy. The final yielding and flexure occur when the\r\nresistant cross-section has been sufficiently diminished. It is\r\nprobable that there is also some outward hydrostaitic thrust over\r\nthe area of rising temperature, which assists in determining the\r\nupward throw of the folds.\r\n\r\nWhen yielding has begun in any geosyncline, and the materials are\r\nfaulted and overthrust, there results a considerably increased\r\nthickness. As an instance, consider the piling up of sediments\r\nover the existing materials of the Alps, which resulted from the\r\ncompressive force acting from south to north in the progress of\r\nAlpine upheaval. Schmidt of Basel has estimated that from 15 to\r\n20 kilometres of rock covered the materials of the Simplon as now\r\nexposed, at the time when the orogenic forces were actively at\r\nwork folding and shearing the beds, and injecting into their\r\nfolds the plastic gneisses coming from beneath.[1] The lateral\r\ncompression of the area of deposition of the Laramide, already\r\nreferred to, resulted in a great thickening of the deposits. Many\r\nother cases might be cited; the effect is always in some degree\r\nnecessarily produced.\r\n\r\n[1] Schmidt, Ec. Geol. _Helvelix_, vol. ix., No. 4, p. 590\r\n\r\n131\r\n\r\nIf time be given for the heat to accumulate in the lower depths\r\nof the crushed-up sediments, here is an additional source of\r\nincreased temperature. The piled-up masses of the Simplon might\r\nhave occasioned a rise due to radioactive heating of one or two\r\nhundred degrees, or even more; and if this be added to the\r\ninterior heat, a total of from 800° to 1000° might have prevailed\r\nin the rocks now exposed at the surface of the mountain. Even a\r\nlesser temperature, accompanied by the intense pressure\r\nconditions, might well occasion the appearances of thermal\r\nmetamorphism described by Weinschenk, and for which, otherwise,\r\nthere is difficulty in accounting.[1]\r\n\r\nThis increase upon the primarily developed temperature conditions\r\ntakes place concurrently with the progress of compression; and\r\nwhile it cannot be taken into account in estimating the\r\nconditions of initial yielding of the crust, it adds an element\r\nof instability, inasmuch as any progressive thickening by lateral\r\ncompression results in an accelerated rise of the goetherms. It\r\nis probable that time sufficient for these effects to develop, if\r\nnot to their final, yet to a considerable extent, is often\r\navailable. The viscous movements of siliceous materials, and the\r\nout-pouring of igneous rocks which often attend mountain\r\nelevation, would find an explanation in such temperatures.\r\n\r\n[1] Weinschenk, _Congrès Géol. Internat._, 1900, i., p. 332.\r\n\r\n132\r\n\r\nThere is no more striking feature of the part here played by\r\nradioactivity than the fact that the rhythmic occurrence of\r\ndepression and upheaval succeeding each other after great\r\nintervals of time, and often shifting their position but little\r\nfrom the first scene of sedimentation, becomes accounted for. The\r\nsource of thermal energy, as we have already remarked, is in fact\r\ntransported with the sediments--that energy which determines the\r\nplace of yielding and upheaval, and ordains that the mountain\r\nranges shall stand around the continental borders. Sedimentation\r\nfrom this point of view is a convection of energy.\r\n\r\nWhen the consolidated sediments are by these and by succeeding\r\nmovements forced upwards into mountains, they are exposed to\r\ndenudative effects greatly exceeding those which affect the\r\nplains. Witness the removal during late Tertiary times of the\r\nvast thickness of rock enveloping the Alps. Such great masses are\r\nhurried away by ice, rivers, and rain. The ocean receives them;\r\nand with infinite patience the world awaits the slow accumulation\r\nof the radioactive energy beginning afresh upon its work. The\r\ntime for such events appears to us immense, for millions of years\r\nare required for the sediments to grow in thickness, and the\r\ngeotherms to move upwards; but vast as it is, it is but a moment\r\nin the life of the parent radioactive substances, whose atoms,\r\nhardly diminished in numbers, pursue their changes while the\r\nmountains come and go, and the\r\n\r\n133\r\n\r\nrudiments of life develop into its highest consummations.\r\n\r\nTo those unacquainted with the results of geological\r\ninvestigation the history of the mountains as deciphered in the\r\nrocks seems almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThe recently published sections of the Himalaya, due to H. H.\r\nHayden and the many distinguished men who have contributed to the\r\nGeological Survey of India, show these great ranges to be\r\nessentially formed of folded sediments penetrated by vast masses\r\nof granite and other eruptives. Their geological history may be\r\nsummarised as follows\r\n\r\nThe Himalayan area in pre-Cambrian times was, in its southwestern\r\nextension, part of the floor of a sea which covered much of what\r\nis now the Indian Peninsula. In the northern shallows of this sea\r\nwere laid down beds of conglomerate, shale, sandstone and\r\nlimestone, derived from the denudation of Archæan rocks, which,\r\nprobably, rose as hills or mountains in parts of Peninsular India\r\nand along the Tibetan edge of the Himalayan region. These beds\r\nconstitute the record of the long Purana Era[1] and are probably\r\ncoeval with the Algonkian of North America. Even in these early\r\ntimes volcanic disturbances affected this area and the lower beds\r\nof the Purana deposits were penetrated by volcanic outflows,\r\ncovered by sheets of lava, uplifted, denuded and again submerged\r\n\r\n[1] See footnote, p. 139.\r\n\r\n134\r\n\r\nbeneath the waters. Two such periods of instability have left\r\ntheir records in the sediments of the Purana sea.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding era--the Dravidian Era--opens with Haimanta\r\n(Cambrian) times. A shallow sea now extended over Kumaun, Garwal,\r\nand Spiti, as well as Kashmir and ultimately over the Salt Range\r\nregion of the Punjab as is shown by deposits in these areas. This\r\nsea was not, however, connected with the Cambrian sea of Europe.\r\nThe fossil faunas left by the two seas are distinct.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of disturbance during closing Haimanta times,\r\ngeographical changes attendant on further land movements\r\noccurred. The central sea of Asia, the Tethys, extended westwards\r\nand now joined with the European Paleozoic sea; and deposits of\r\nOrdovician and Silurian age were laid down:--the Muth deposits.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding Devonian Period saw the whole Northern Himalayan\r\narea under the waters of the Tethys which, eastward, extended to\r\nBurma and China and, westward, covered Kashmir, the Hindu Kush\r\nand part of Afghanistan. Deposits continued to be formed in this\r\narea till middle Carboniferous times.\r\n\r\nNear. the close of the Dravidian Era Kashmir became convulsed by\r\nvolcanic disturbance and the Penjal traps were ejected. It was a\r\ntime of worldwide disturbance and of redistribution of land and\r\nwater. Carboniferous times had begun, and the geographical\r\nchanges in\r\n\r\n135\r\n\r\nthe southern limits of the Tethys are regarded as ushering in a\r\nnew and last era in Indian geological history the Aryan Bra.\r\n\r\nIndia was now part of Gondwanaland; that vanished continent which\r\nthen reached westward to South Africa and eastward to Australia.\r\nA boulder-bed of glacial origin, the Talchir Boulder-bed, occurs\r\nin many surviving parts of this great land. It enters largely\r\ninto the Salt Range deposits. There is evidence that extensive\r\nsheets of ice, wearing down the rocks of Rajputana, shoved their\r\nmoraines northward into the Salt Range Sea; then, probably, a\r\nsouthern extension of the Tethys.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to this ice age the Indian coalfields of the Gondwana\r\nwere laid down, with beds rich in the Glossopteris and\r\nGangamopteris flora. This remarkable carboniferous flora extends\r\nto Southern Kashmir, so that it is to be inferred that this\r\nregion was also part of the main Gondwanaland. But its emergence\r\nwas but for a brief period. Upper Carboniferous marine deposits\r\nsucceeded; and, in fact, there was no important discontinuity in\r\nthe deposits in this area from Panjal times till the early\r\nTertiaries. During the whole of which vast period Kashmir was\r\ncovered with the waters of the Tethys.\r\n\r\nThe closing Dravidian disturbances of the Kashmir region did not,\r\napparently, extend to the eastern Himalayan area. But the\r\nCarboniferous Period was, in this\r\n\r\n136\r\n\r\neastern area, one of instability, culminating, at the close of\r\nthe Period, in a steady rise of the land and a northward retreat\r\nof the Tethys. Nearly the entire Himalaya east of Kashmir became\r\na land surface and remained exposed to denudative forces for so\r\nlong a time that in places the whole of the Carboniferous,\r\nDevonian, and a large part of the Silurian and Ordovician\r\ndeposits were removed--some thousands of feet in thickness--before\r\nresubmergence in the Tethys occurred.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the Palaeozoic Age the Aryan Tethys receded\r\nwestwards, but still covered the Himalaya and was still connected\r\nwith the European Palæozoic sea. The Himalayan area (as well as\r\nKashmir) remained submerged in its waters throughout the entire\r\nMesozoic Age.\r\n\r\nDuring Cretaceous times the Tethys became greatly extended,\r\nindicating a considerable subsidence of northwestern India,\r\nAfghanistan, Western Asia, and, probably, much of Tibet. The\r\nshallow-water character of the deposits of the Tibetan Himalaya\r\nindicates, however, a coast line near this region. Volcanic\r\nmaterials, now poured out, foreshadow the incoming of the great\r\nmountain-building epoch of the Tertiary Era. The enormous mass of\r\nthe Deccan traps, possessing a volume which has been estimated at\r\nas much as 6,000 cubic miles, was probably extruded over the\r\nNorthern Peninsular region during late Cretaceous times. The sea\r\nnow began to retreat, and by the close of\r\n\r\n137\r\n\r\nthe Eocene, it had moved westward to Sind and Baluchistan. The\r\nmovements of the Earth's crust were attended by intense volcanic\r\nactivity, and great volumes of granite were injected into the\r\nsediments, followed by dykes and outflows of basic lavas.\r\n\r\nThe Tethys vanished to return no more. It survives in the\r\nMediterranean of today. The mountain-building movements continued\r\ninto Pliocene times. The Nummulite beds of the Eocene were, as\r\nthe result, ultimately uplifted 18,500 feet over sea level, a\r\ntotal uplift of not less than 20,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThus with many vicissitudes, involving intervals of volcanic\r\nactivity, local uplifting, and extensive local denudation, the\r\nHimalaya, which had originated in the sediments of the ancient\r\nPurana sea, far back in pre-Cambrian times, and which had\r\ndeveloped potentially in a long sequence of deposits collecting\r\nalmost continuously throughout the whole of geological time,\r\nfinally took their place high in the heavens, where only the\r\nwinds--faint at such altitudes--and the lights of heaven can visit\r\ntheir eternal snows.[1]\r\n\r\nIn this great history it is significant that the longest\r\ncontinuous series of sedimentary deposits which the world has\r\nknown has become transfigured into the loftiest elevation upon\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\n[1] See A Sketch of the _Geography and Geology of the Himalaya\r\nMountains and Tibet_. By Colonel S. G. Burrard, R.E., F.R.S., and\r\nH. H. Hayden, F.G.S., Part IV. Calcutta, 1908.\r\n\r\n138\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic sections of the Himalaya accompanying this brief\r\ndescription arc taken from the monograph of Burrard and Hayden\r\n(loc. cit.) on the Himalaya. Looking at the sections we see that\r\nsome of the loftiest summits are sculptured in granite and other\r\ncrystalline rocks. The appearance of these materials at the\r\nsurface indicates the removal by denudation and the extreme\r\nmetamorphism of much sedimentary deposit. The crystalline rocks,\r\nindeed, penetrate some of the oldest rocks in the world. They\r\nappear in contact with Archaean, Algonkian or early Palaeozoic\r\nrocks. A study of the sections reveals not only the severe earth\r\nmovements, but also the immense amount of sedimentary deposits\r\ninvolved in the genesis of these alps. It will be noted that the\r\nvertical scale is not exaggerated relatively to the\r\nhorizontal.[1] Although there is no evidence of mountain\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n[1] To those unacquainted with the terminology of Indian geology\r\nthe following list of approximate equivalents in time will be of\r\nuse\r\n\r\nNgari Khorsum Beds - Pleistocene.\r\nSiwalik Series -     Miocene and Pliocene.\r\nSirmur Series -      Oligocene.\r\nKampa System -       Eocene and Cretaceous.\r\nLilang System -      Triassic.\r\nKuling System -      Permian.\r\nGondwana System -    Carboniferous.\r\nKenawar System -     Carboniferous and Devonian\r\nMuth System -        Silurian.\r\nHaimanta System -    Mid. and Lower Cambrian.\r\nPurana Group -       Algonkian.\r\nVaikrita System -    Archæan.\r\nDaling Series -      Archæan.\r\n\r\n139\r\n\r\non a large scale in the Himalayan area till the Tertiary\r\nupheaval, it is, in the majority of cases, literally correct to\r\nspeak of the mountains as having their generations like organic\r\nbeings, and passing through all the stages of birth, life, death\r\nand reproduction. The Alps, the Jura, the Pyrenees, the Andes,\r\nhave been remade more than once in the course of geological time,\r\nthe _débris_ of a worn-out range being again uplifted in succeeding\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThus to dwell for a moment on one case only: that of the\r\nPyrenees. The Pyrenees arose as a range of older Palmozoic rocks\r\nin Devonian times. These early mountains, however, were\r\nsufficiently worn out and depressed by Carboniferous times to\r\nreceive the deposits of that age laid down on the up-turned edges\r\nof the older rocks. And to Carboniferous succeeded Permian,\r\nTriassic, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments all laid down\r\nin conformable sequence. There was then fresh disturbance and\r\nupheaval followed by denudation, and these mountains, in turn,\r\nbecame worn out and depressed beneath the ocean so that Upper\r\nGreensand rocks were laid down unconforrnably on all beneath. To\r\nthese now succeeded Upper Chalk, sediments of Danian age, and so\r\non, till Eocene times, when the tale was completed and the\r\nexisting ranges rose from the sea. Today we find the folded\r\nNummulitic strata of Eocene age uplifted 11,000 feet, or within\r\n200 feet of the greatest heights of the Pyrenees. And so they\r\nstand awaiting\r\n\r\n140\r\n\r\nthe time when once again they shall \"fall into the portion of\r\noutworn faces.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOnly mountains can beget mountains. Great accumulations of\r\nsediment are a necessary condition for the localisation of\r\ncrust-flexure. The earliest mountains arose as purely igneous or\r\nvolcanic elevations, but the generations of the hills soon\r\noriginated in the collection of the _débris_, under the law of\r\ngravity, in the hollow places. And if a foundered range is\r\nexposed now to our view encumbered with thousands of feet of\r\noverlying sediments we know that while the one range was sinking,\r\nanother, from which the sediments were derived, surely existed.\r\nThrough the \"windows\" in the deep-cut rocks of the Swiss valleys\r\nwe see the older Carboniferous Alps looking out, revisiting the\r\nsun light, after scores of millions of years of imprisonment. We\r\nknow that just as surely as the Alps of today are founding by\r\ntheir muddy torrents ranges yet to arise, so other primeval Alps\r\nfed into the ocean the materials of these buried pre-Permian\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThis succession of events only can cease when the rocks have been\r\nsufficiently impoverished of the heat-producing substances, or\r\nthe forces of compression shall have died out in the surface\r\ncrust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to escape the conclusion that in the great\r\ndevelopment of ocean-encircling areas of\r\n\r\n[1] See Prestwich, _Chemical and Physical Geology_, p. 302.\r\n\r\n141\r\n\r\ndeposition and crustal folding, the heat of radioactivity has\r\nbeen a determining factor. We recognise in the movements of the\r\nsediments not only an influence localising and accelerating\r\ncrustal movements, but one which, in subservience to the primal\r\ndistribution of land and water, has determined some of the\r\ngreatest geographical features of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than a step to show that bound up with the\r\nradioactive energy are most of the earthquake and volcanic\r\nphenomena of the earth. The association of earthquakes with the\r\ngreat geosynclines is well known. The work of De Montessus showed\r\nthat over 94 per cent. of all recorded shocks lie in the\r\ngeosynclinal belts. There can be no doubt that these\r\nmanifestations of instability are the results of the local\r\nweakness and flexure which originated in the accumulation of\r\nenergy denuded from the continents. Similarly we may view in\r\nvolcanoes phenomena referable to the same fundamental cause. The\r\nvolcano was, in fact, long regarded as more intimately connected\r\nwith earthquakes than it, probably, actually is; the association\r\nbeing regarded in a causative light, whereas the connexion is\r\nmore that of possessing a common origin. The girdle of volcanoes\r\naround the Pacific and the earthquake belt coincide. Again, the\r\nancient and modern volcanoes and earthquakes of Europe are\r\nassociated with the geosyncline of the greater Mediterranean, the\r\nTethys of Mesozoic times. There is no difficulty in understanding\r\nin a\r\n\r\n142\r\n\r\ngeneral way the nature of the association. The earthquake is the\r\nmanifestation of rupture and slip, and, as Suess has shown, the\r\nepicentres shift along that fault line where the crust has\r\nyielded.[1] The volcano marks the spot where the zone of fusion\r\nis brought so high in the fractured crust that the melted\r\nmaterials are poured out upon the surface.\r\n\r\nIn a recent work on the subject of earthquakes Professor Hobbs\r\nwrites: \"One of the most interesting of the generalisations which\r\nDe Montessus has reached as a result of his protracted studies,\r\nis that the earthquake districts on the land correspond almost\r\nexactly to those belts upon the globe which were the almost\r\ncontinuous ocean basins of the long Secondary era of geological\r\nhistory. Within these belts the sedimentary formations of the\r\ncrust were laid down in the greatest thickness, and the\r\nformations follow each other in relatively complete succession.\r\nFor almost or quite the whole of this long era it is therefore\r\nclear that the ocean covered these zones. About them the\r\nformations are found interrupted, and the lacuna indicate that\r\nthe sea invaded the area only to recede from it, and again at\r\nsome later period to transgress upon it. For a long time,\r\ntherefore, these earthquake belts were the sea basins--the\r\ngeosynclines. They became later the rising mountains of the\r\nTertiary period, and mountains they\r\n\r\n[1] Suess, _The Face of the Earth_, vol. ii., chap. ii.\r\n\r\n143\r\n\r\nare today. The earthquake belts are hence those portions of the\r\nearth's crust which in recent times have suffered the greatest\r\nmovements in a vertical direction--they are the most mobile\r\nportions of the earth's crust.\"[1] Whether the movements\r\nattending mountain elevation and denudation are a connected and\r\nintegral part of those wide geographical changes which result in\r\nsubmergence and elevation of large continental areas, is an\r\nobscure and complex question. We seem, indeed, according to the\r\nviews of some authorities, hardly in a position to affirm with\r\ncertainty that such widespread movements of the land have\r\nactually occurred, and that the phenomena are not the outcome of\r\nfluctuations of oceanic level; that our observations go no\r\nfurther than the recognition of positive and negative movements\r\nof the strand. However this may be, the greater part of\r\nmechanical denudation during geological time has been done on the\r\nmountain ranges. It is, in short, indisputable that the orogenic\r\nmovements which uplift the hills have been at the basis of\r\ngeological history. To them the great accumulations of sediments\r\nwhich now form so large a part of continental land are mainly\r\ndue. There can be no doubt of the fact that these movements have\r\nswayed the entire history, both inorganic and organic, of the\r\nworld in which we live.\r\n\r\n[1] Hobbs, _Earthquakes_, p. 58.\r\n\r\n144\r\n\r\nTo sum the contents of this essay in the most general terms, we\r\nfind that in the conception of denudation as producing the\r\nconvection and accumulation of radiothermal energy the surface\r\nfeatures of the globe receive a new significance. The heat of the\r\nearth is not internal only, but rather a heat-source exists at\r\nthe surface, which, as we have seen, cannot prevail to the same\r\ndegree within; and when the conditions become favourable for the\r\naggregation of the energy, the crust, heated both from beneath\r\nand from above, assumes properties more akin to those of its\r\nearlier stages of development, the secular heat-loss being\r\nrestored in the radioactive supplies. These causes of local\r\nmobility have been in operation, shifting somewhat from place to\r\nplace, and defined geographically by the continental masses\r\nundergoing denudation, since the earliest times.\r\n\r\n145\r\n\r\nALPINE STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nAN intelligent observer of the geological changes progressing in\r\nsouthern Europe in Eocene times would have seen little to inspire\r\nhim with a premonition of the events then developing. The\r\nNummulitic limestones were being laid down in that enlarged\r\nMediterranean which at this period, save for a few islands,\r\ncovered most of south Europe. Of these stratified remains, as\r\nwell as of the great beds of Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, and\r\nPermian sediments beneath, our hypothetical observer would\r\nprobably have been regardless; just as today we observe, with an\r\nindifference born of our transitoriness, the deposits rapidly\r\ngathering wherever river discharge is distributing the sediments\r\nover the sea-floor, or the lime-secreting organisms are actively\r\nat work. And yet it took but a few millions of years to uplift\r\nthe deposits of the ancient Tethys; pile high its sediments in\r\nfold upon fold in the Alps, the Carpathians, and the Himalayas;\r\nand--exposing them to the rigours of denudation at altitudes where\r\nglaciation, landslip, and torrent prevail--inaugurate a new epoch\r\nof sedimentation and upheaval.\r\n\r\n146\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Alps, to which we wish now specially to refer,\r\nthe chief upheaval appears to have been in Oligocene times,\r\nalthough movement continued to the close of the Pliocene. There\r\nwas thus a period of some millions of years within which the\r\nentire phenomena were comprised. Availing ourselves of Sollas'\r\ncomputations,[1] we may sum the maximum depths of sedimentary\r\ndeposits of the geological periods concerned as follows:--\r\n\r\nPliocene - - - - - 3,950 m.\r\n\r\nMiocene  - - - - - 4,250 m.\r\n\r\nOligocene  - - - - 3,660 m.\r\n\r\nEocene - - - - - - 6,100 m.\r\n\r\nand assuming that the orogenic forces began their work in the\r\nlast quarter of the Eocene period, we have a total of 13,400 m.\r\nas some measure of the time which elapsed. At the rate of io\r\ncentimetres in a century these deposits could not have collected\r\nin less than 13.4 millions of years. It would appear that not\r\nless than some ten millions of years were consumed in the genesis\r\nof the Alps before constructive movements finally ceased.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the earth-movements was attended by the usual\r\nvolcanic phenomena. The Oligocene and Miocene volcanoes extended\r\nin a band marked by the Auvergne, the Eiffel, the Bohemian, and\r\nthe eastern Carpathian eruptions; and, later, towards the close\r\nof the movements in Pliocene times, the south border\r\n\r\n[1] Sollas, Anniversary Address, Geol. Soc., London, 1909.\r\n\r\n147\r\n\r\nregions of the Alps became the scene of eruptions such as those\r\nof Etna, Santorin, Somma (Vesuvius), etc.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to these well-known episodes with two objects in\r\nview: to recall to mind the time-interval involved, and the\r\nevidence of intense crustal disturbance, both dynamic and\r\nthermal. According to views explained in a previous essay, the\r\nenergetic effects of radium in the sediments and upper crust were\r\na principal factor in localising and bringing about these\r\nresults. We propose now to inquire if, also, in the more intimate\r\nstructure of the Alps, the radioactive energy may not have borne\r\na part.\r\n\r\nWhat we see today in the Alps is but a residue spared by\r\ndenudation. It is certain that vast thicknesses of material have\r\ndisappeared. Even while constructive effects were still in\r\nprogress, denudative forces were not idle. Of this fact the\r\nshingle accumulations of the Molasse, where, on the northern\r\nborders of the Alps, they stand piled into mountains, bear\r\neloquent testimony. In the sub-Apennine series of Italy, the\r\ngreat beds of clays, marls, and limestones afford evidence of\r\nthese destructive processes continued into Pliocene times. We\r\nhave already referred to Schmidt's estimate that the sedimentary\r\ncovering must have in places amounted to from 15,000 to 20,000\r\nmetres. The evidence for this is mainly tectonic or structural;\r\nbut is partly forthcoming in the changes which the materials now\r\nopen to our inspection plainly reveal. Thus it is impos-\r\n\r\n148\r\n\r\nsible to suppose that gneissic rocks can become so far plastic as\r\nto flow in and around the calcareous sediments, or be penetrated\r\nby the latter--as we see in the Jungfrau and elsewhere--unless\r\ngreat pressures and high temperatures prevailed. And, according\r\nto some writers, the temperatures revealed by the intimate\r\nstructural changes of rock-forming minerals must have amounted to\r\nthose of fusion. The existence of such conditions is supported by\r\nthe observation that where the.crystallisation is now the most\r\nperfect, the phenomena of folding and injection are best\r\ndeveloped.[1] These high temperatures would appear to be\r\nunaccountable without the intervention of radiothermal effects;\r\nand, indeed, have been regarded as enigmatic by observers of the\r\nphenomena in question. A covering of 20,000 metres in thickness\r\nwould not occasion an earth-temperature exceeding 500° C. if the\r\ngradients were such as obtain in mountain regions generally; and\r\n600° is about the limit we could ascribe to the purely passive\r\neffects of such a layer in elevating the geotherms.\r\n\r\nThose who are still unacquainted with the recently published\r\nobservations on the structure of the Alps may find it difficult\r\nto enter into what has now to be stated; for the facts are,\r\nindeed, very different from the generally preconceived ideas of\r\nmountain formation. Nor can we wonder that many geologists for\r\nlong held\r\n\r\n[1] Weinschenk, C. R. _Congrès Géol._, 1900, p. 321, et seq.\r\n\r\n149\r\n\r\nback from admitting views which appeared so extreme. Receptivity\r\nis the first virtue of the scientific mind; but, with every\r\ndesire to lay aside prejudice, many felt unequal to the\r\nacceptance of structural features involving a folding of the\r\nearth-crust in laps which lay for scores of miles from country to\r\ncountry, and the carriage of mountainous materials from the south\r\nof the Alps to the north, leaving them finally as Alpine ranges\r\nof ancient sediments reposing on foundations of more recent date.\r\nThe historian of the subject will have to relate how some who\r\nfinally were most active in advancing the new views were at first\r\nopposed to them. In the change of conviction of these eminent\r\ngeologists we have the strongest proof of the convincing nature\r\nof the observations and the reality of the tectonic features upon\r\nwhich the recent views are founded.\r\n\r\nThe lesser mountains which stand along the northern border of the\r\ngreat limestone Alps, those known as the Préalpes, present the\r\nstrange characteristic of resting upon materials younger than\r\nthemselves. Such mountains as the remarkable-looking Mythen, near\r\nSchwyz, for instance, are weathered from masses of Triassic and\r\nJurassic rock, and repose on the much more recent Flysch. In\r\nsharp contrast to the Flysch scenery, they stand as abrupt and\r\ngigantic erratics, which have been transported from the central\r\nzone of the Alps lying far to the south. They are strangers\r\npetrologically,\r\n\r\n150\r\n\r\nstratigraphically, and geographically,[1] to the locality in\r\nwhich they now occur. The exotic materials may be dolomites,\r\nlimestones, schists, sandstones, or rocks of igneous origin. They\r\nshow in every case traces of the severe dynamic actions to which\r\nthey have been subjected in transit. The igneous, like the\r\nsedimentary, klippen, can be traced to distant sources; to the\r\nmassif of Belladonne, to Mont Blanc, Lugano, and the Tyrol. The\r\nPréalpes are, in fact, mountains without local roots.\r\n\r\nIn this last-named essential feature, the Préalpes do not differ\r\nfrom the still greater limestone Alps which succeed them to the\r\nsouth. These giants, _e.g._ the Jungfrau, Wetterhorn, Eiger, etc.,\r\nare also without local foundations. They have been formed from\r\nthe overthrown and drawn-out anticlines of great crust-folds,\r\nwhose synclines or roots are traceable to the south side of the\r\nRhone Valley. The Bernese Oberland originated in the piling-up of\r\nfour great sheets or recumbent folds, one of which is continued\r\ninto the Préalpes. With Lugeon[2] we may see in the phenomenon of\r\nthe formation of the Préalpes a detail; regarding it as a normal\r\nexpression of that mechanism which has created the Swiss Alps.\r\nFor these limestone masses of the Oberland are not indications of\r\na merely local shift of the sedimentary covering of the Alps.\r\nAlmost the whole covering has\r\n\r\n[1] De Lapparent, _Traité de Géologie_, p. 1,785.\r\n\r\n[2] Lugeon, _Bulletin Soc. Géol. de France_, 1901, p. 772.\r\n\r\n151\r\n\r\nbeen pushed over and piled up to the north. Lugeon[l] concludes\r\nthat, before denudation had done its work and cut off the\r\nPréalpes from their roots, there would have been found sheets, to\r\nthe number of eight, superimposed and extending between the Mont\r\nBlanc massif and the massif of the Finsteraarhorn: these sheets\r\nbeing the overthrown folds of the wrinkled sedimentary covering.\r\nThe general nature of the alpine structure\r\n\r\n{Fig. 8}\r\n\r\nwill be understood from the presentation of it diagrammatically\r\nafter Schmidt of Basel (Fig. 8).[2] The section extends from\r\nnorth to south, and brings out the relations of the several\r\nrecumbent folds. We must imagine almost the whole of these\r\nsuperimposed folds now removed from the central regions of the\r\nAlps by denudation,\r\n\r\n[1] Lugeon, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[2] Schmidt, _Ec. Geol. Helvetiae_, vol. ix., No. 4.\r\n\r\n152\r\n\r\nand leaving the underlying gneisses rising through the remains of\r\nPermian, Triassic, and Jurassic sediments; while to the north the\r\ngreat limestone mountains and further north still, the Préalpes,\r\ncarved from the remains of the recumbent folds, now stand with\r\nalmost as little resemblance to the vanished mountains as the\r\nmemories of the past have to its former intense reality.\r\n\r\nThese views as to the origin of the Alps, which are shared at the\r\npresent day by so many distinguished geologists, had their origin\r\nin the labours of many now gone; dating back to Studer; finding\r\ntheir inspiration in the work of Heim, Suess, and Marcel\r\nBertrand; and their consummation in that of Lugeon, Schardt,\r\nRothpletz, Schmidt, and many others. Nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat nearer home, somewhat similar phenomena, necessarily on a\r\nsmaller scale, were recognised by Lapworth, twenty-six years ago,\r\nin his work on the structure of the Scottish Highlands.\r\n\r\nAn important tectonic principle underlies the development of the\r\nphenomena we have just been reviewing. The uppermost of the\r\nsuperimposed recumbent folds is more extended in its development\r\nthan those which lie beneath. Passing downwards from the highest\r\nof the folds, they are found to be less and less extended both in\r\nthe northerly and in the southerly direction, speaking of the\r\nspecial case--the Alps--now before us. This feature might be\r\ndescribed somewhat differently. We might say that those folds\r\nwhich had their roots farther\r\n\r\n153\r\n\r\nto the south were the most drawn-out towards the north: or again\r\nwe might say that the synclinal or deep-seated part of the fold\r\nhas lagged behind the anticlinal or what was originally the\r\nhighest part of the fold, in the advance of the latter to the\r\nnorth. The anticline has advanced relatively to the syncline. To\r\nthis law one exception only is observed in the Swiss Alps; the\r\nsheet of the Brèche (_Byecciendecke_) falls short, in its northerly\r\nextension, of the underlying fold, which extends to form the\r\nPréalpes.\r\n\r\nContemplating such a generalised section as Professor Schmidt's,\r\nor, indeed, more particular sections, such as those in the Mont\r\nBlanc Massif by Marcel Bertrand,[1] of the Dent de Morcles,\r\nDiablerets, Wildhorn, and Massif de la Brèche by Lugeon,[2] or\r\nfinally Termier's section of the Pelvoux Massif,[3] one is\r\nreminded of the breaking of waves on a sloping beach. The wave,\r\nretarded at its base, is carried forward above by its momentum,\r\nand finally spreads far up on the strand; and if it could there\r\nremain, the succeeding wave must necessarily find itself\r\nsuperimposed upon the first. But no effects of inertia, no\r\nkinetic effects, may be called to our aid in explaining the\r\nformation of mountains. Some geologists have accordingly supposed\r\nthat in order to account for\r\n\r\n[1] Marcel Bertrand, _Cong. Géol. Internat._, 1900, Guide Géol.,\r\nxiii. a, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[2] Lugeon, _loc. cit._, p. 773.\r\n\r\n[3] De Lapparent, _Traite de Géol._, p. 1,773.\r\n\r\n154\r\n\r\nthe recumbent folds and the peculiar phenomena of increasing\r\noverlap, or _déferlement_, an obstacle, fixed and deep-seated, must\r\nhave arrested the roots or synclines of the folds, and held them\r\nagainst translational motion, while a movement of the upper crust\r\ndrew out and carried forward the anticlines. Others have\r\ncontented themselves by recording the facts without advancing any\r\nexplanatory hypothesis beyond that embodied in the incontestable\r\nstatement that such phenomena must be referred to the effects of\r\ntangential forces acting in the Earth's crust.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the explanation of the phenomena of\r\nrecumbent folds and their _déferlement_ is to be obtained directly\r\nfrom the temperature conditions prevailing throughout the\r\nstressed pile of rocks; and here the subject of mountain\r\ntectonics touches that with which we were elsewhere specially\r\nconcerned--the geological influence of accumulated radioactive\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nAs already shown[1], a rise of temperature due to this source of\r\nseveral hundred degrees might be added to such temperatures as\r\nwould arise from the mere blanketing of the Earth, and the\r\nconsequent upward movement of the geotherms. The time element is\r\nhere the most important consideration. The whole sequence of\r\nevents from the first orogenic movements to the final upheaval in\r\nPliocene times must probably have occupied not less than ten\r\nmillion years.\r\n\r\n[1] _Mountain Genesis_, p. 129, et seq.\r\n\r\n155\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the full investigation of the distribution of\r\ntemperature after any given time is beset with difficulties; the\r\nconditions being extremely complex. If the radioactive heating\r\nwas strictly adiabatic--that is, if all the heat was conserved and\r\nnone entered from without--the time required for the attainment of\r\nthe equilibrium radioactive temperature would be just about six\r\nmillion years. The conditions are not, indeed, adiabatic; but, on\r\nthe other hand, the rocks upraised by lateral pressure were by no\r\nmeans at 0° C. to start with. They must be assumed to have\r\npossessed such temperatures as the prior radiothermal effects,\r\nand the conducted heat from the Earth's interior, may have\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nIt would from this appear probable that if a duration of ten\r\nmillion years was involved, the equilibrium radioactive\r\ntemperatures must nearly have been attained. The effects of heat\r\nconducted from the underlying earthcrust have to be added,\r\nleading to a further rise in temperature of not less than 500° or\r\n600° . In such considerations the observed indications of high\r\ntemperatures in materials now laid bare by denudation, probably\r\nfind their explanation (P1. XIX).\r\n\r\nThe first fact that we infer from the former existence of such a\r\ntemperature distribution is the improbability, indeed the\r\nimpossibility, that anything resembling a rigid obstacle, or\r\ndeep-seated \"horst,\" can have existed beneath the present\r\nsurface-level, and opposed the northerly movement of the\r\ndeep-lying synclines. For\r\n\r\n156\r\n\r\nsuch a horst can only have been constituted of some siliceous\r\nrock-material such as we find everywhere rising through the\r\nworn-down sediments of the Alps; and the idea that this could\r\nretain rigidity under the prevailing temperature conditions, must\r\nbe dismissed. There is no need to labour this question; the horst\r\ncannot have existed. To what, then, is the retardation of the\r\nlower parts of the folds, their overthrow, above, to the north,\r\nand their _déferlement_, to be ascribed?\r\n\r\nA little consideration shows that the very conditions of high\r\ntemperature and viscosity, which render untenable the hypothesis\r\nof a rigid obstacle, suffice to afford a full explanation of the\r\nretardation of the roots of the folds. For directed translatory\r\nmovements cannot be transmitted through a fluid, pressure in\r\nwhich is necessarily hydrostatic, and must be exerted equally in\r\nevery direction. And this applies, not only to a fluid, but to a\r\nbody which will yield viscously to an impressed force. There will\r\nbe a gradation, according as viscosity gives place to rigidity,\r\nbetween the states in which the applied force resolves itself\r\ninto a purely hydrostatic pressure, and in which it is\r\ntransmitted through the material as a directed thrust. The nature\r\nof the force, in the most general case, of course, has to be\r\nconsidered; whether it is suddenly applied and of brief duration,\r\nor steady and long-continued. The latter conditions alone apply\r\nto the present case.\r\n\r\nIt follows from this that, although a tangential force\r\n\r\n157\r\n\r\nor pressure be engendered by a crustal movement occurring to the\r\nsouth, and the resultant effects be transmitted northwards, these\r\nstresses can only mechanically affect the rigid parts of the\r\ncrust into which they are carried. That is to say, they may\r\nresult in folding and crushing, or horizontally transporting, the\r\nupper layers of the Earth's crust; but in the deeper-lying\r\nviscous materials they must be resolved into hydrostatic pressure\r\nwhich may act to upheave the overlying covering, but must refuse\r\nto transmit the horizontal translatory movements affecting the\r\nrigid materials above.\r\n\r\nBetween the regions in which these two opposing conditions\r\nprevail there will be no hard and fast line; but with the\r\ndownward increase of fluidity there will be a gradual failure of\r\nthe mechanical conditions and an increase of the hydrostatic.\r\nThus while the uppermost layers of the crust may be transported\r\nto the full amount of the crustal displacement acting from the\r\nsouth (speaking still of the Alps) deeper down there will be a\r\nlesser horizontal movement, and still deeper there is no\r\ninfluence to urge the viscous rock-materials in a northerly\r\ndirection. The consequences of these conditions must be the\r\nrecumbence of the folds formed under the crust-stress, and their\r\n_déferlement_ towards the north. To see this, we must follow the\r\nseveral stages of development.\r\n\r\nThe earliest movements, we may suppose, result in flexures of the\r\nJura-Mountain type--that is, in a\r\n\r\n158\r\n\r\nsuccession of undulations more or less symmetrical. As the\r\norogenic force continues and develops, these undulations give\r\nplace to folds, the limbs of which are approximately vertical,\r\nand the synclinal parts of which become ever more and more\r\ndepressed into the deeper, and necessarily hotter, underlying\r\nmaterials; the anticlines being probably correspondingly\r\nelevated. These events are slowly developed, and the temperature\r\nbeneath is steadily rising in consequence of the conducted\r\ninterior heat, and the steady accumulation of radioactive energy\r\nin the sedimentary rocks and in the buried radioactive layer of\r\nthe Earth. The work expended on the crushed and sheared rock also\r\ncontributes to the developing temperature. Thus the geotherms\r\nmust move upwards, and the viscous conditions extend from below;\r\ncontinually diminishing the downward range of the translatory\r\nmovements progressing in the higher parts. While above the folded\r\nsediments are being carried northward, beneath they are becoming\r\nanchored in the growing viscosity of the medium. The anticlines\r\nwill bend over, and the most southerly of the folds will\r\ngradually become pushed or bent over those lying to the north.\r\nFinally, the whole upper part of the sheaf will become\r\nhorizontally recumbent; and as the uppermost folds will be those\r\nexperiencing the greatest effects of the continued displacement,\r\nthe _déferlement_ or overlap must necessarily arise.\r\n\r\nWe may follow these stages of mountain evolution\r\n\r\n159\r\n\r\nin a diagram (Fig. 9) in which we eliminate intermediate\r\nconditions, and regard the early and final stages of development\r\nonly. In the upper sketch we suppose the lateral compression much\r\ndeveloped and the upward movement of the geotherms in progress.\r\nThe dotted line may be assumed to be a geotherm having a\r\ntemperature of viscosity. If the conditions here shown persist\r\n\r\n{Fig. 9}\r\n\r\nindefinitely, there is no doubt that the only further\r\ndevelopments possible are the continued crushing of the sediments\r\nand the bodily displacement of the whole mass to the north. The\r\nsecond figure is intended to show in what manner these results\r\nare evaded. The geotherm of viscosity has risen. All above it is\r\naffected mechanically by the continuing stress, and borne\r\nnorthwards in varying\r\n\r\n160\r\n\r\ndegree depending upon the rigidity. The folds have been\r\noverthrown and drawn out; those which lay originally most to the\r\nsouth have become the uppermost; and, experiencing the maximum\r\namount of displacement, overlap those lying beneath. There has\r\nalso been a certain amount of upthrow owing to the hydrostatic\r\npressure. This last-mentioned element of the phenomena is of\r\nhighly indeterminate character, for we know not the limits to\r\nwhich the hydrostatic pressure may be transmitted, and where it\r\nmay most readily find relief. While, according to some of the\r\npublished sections, the uplifting force would seem to have\r\ninfluenced the final results of the orogenic movements, a\r\ndiscussion of its effects would not be profitable.\r\n\r\n161\r\n\r\nOTHER MINDS THAN OURS?\r\n\r\nIN the year 1610 Galileo, looking through his telescope then\r\nnewly perfected by his own hands, discovered that the planet\r\nJupiter was attended by a train of tiny stars which went round\r\nand round him just as the moon goes round the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt was a revelation too great to be credited by mankind. It was\r\nopposed to the doctrine of the centrality of the Earth, for it\r\nsuggested that other worlds constituted like ours might exist in\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nSome said it was a mere optic illusion; others that he who looked\r\nthrough such a tube did it at the peril of his soul--it was but a\r\ndelusion of Satan. Galileo converted a few of the unbelievers who\r\nhad the courage to look through his telescope. To the others he\r\nsaid, he hoped they would see those moons on their way to heaven.\r\nOld as this story is it has never lost its pathos or its\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which assailed Galileo's discoveries and which finally\r\nwas potent to overshadow his declining years, closed in former\r\ndays the mouths of those who asked the question written at the\r\nhead of this lecture: \"Are we to believe that there are other\r\nminds than ours?\"\r\n\r\n162\r\n\r\nToday we consider the question in a very different spirit. Few\r\nwould regard it as either foolish or improper. Its intense\r\ninterest would be admitted by all, and but for the limitations\r\nclosing our way on every side it would, doubtless, attract the\r\nmost earnest investigation. Even on the mere balance of judgment\r\nbetween the probable and the improbable, we have little to go on.\r\nWe know nothing definitely as to the conditions under which life\r\nmay originate: whether these are such as to be rare almost to\r\nimpossibility, or common almost to certainty. Only within narrow\r\nlimits of temperature and in presence of certain of the elements,\r\ncan life like ours exist, and outside these conditions life, if\r\nsuch there be, must be different from ours. Once originated it is\r\nso constituted as to assail the energies around it and to advance\r\nfrom less to greater. Do we know more than these vague facts?\r\nYes, we have in our experience one other fact and one involving\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWe know that our world is very old; that life has been for many\r\nmillions of years upon it; and that Man as a thinking being is\r\nbut of yesterday. Here is then a condition to be fulfilled. To\r\nevery world is physically assigned a limit to the period during\r\nwhich it is habitable according to our knowledge of life and its\r\nnecessities. This limit passed and rationality missed, the chance\r\nfor that world is gone for ever, and other minds than ours\r\nassuredly will not from it contemplate the universe. Looking at\r\nour own world we see that the tree of life has,\r\n\r\n163\r\n\r\nindeed, branched, leaved and, possibly, budded many times; it\r\nnever bloomed but once.\r\n\r\nAll difficulties dissolve and speculations become needless under\r\none condition only: that in which rationality may be inferred\r\ndirectly or indirectly by our observations on some sister world\r\nin space, This is just the evidence which in recent years has\r\nbeen claimed as derived from a study of the surface of Mars. To\r\nthat planet our hope of such evidence is restricted. Our survey\r\nin all other directions is barred by insurmountable difficulties.\r\nUnless some meteoric record reached our Earth, revelationary of\r\nintelligence on a perished world, our only hope of obtaining such\r\nevidence rests on the observation of Mars' surface features. To\r\nthis subject we confine our attention in what follows.\r\n\r\nThe observations made during recent years upon the surface\r\nfeatures of Mars have, excusably enough, given rise to\r\nsensational reports. We must consider under what circumstances\r\nthese observations have been made.\r\n\r\nMars comes into particularly favourable conditions for\r\nobservation every fifteen years. It is true that every two years\r\nand two months we overtake him in his orbit and he is then in\r\n\"opposition.\" That is, the Earth is between him and the sun: he\r\nis therefore in the opposite part of the heavens to the sun. Now\r\nMars' orbit is very excentric, sometimes he is 139 million miles\r\nfrom the sun, and sometimes he as as much as 154 million miles\r\nfrom the sun. The Earth's orbit is, by comparison, almost\r\n\r\n164\r\n\r\na circle. Evidently if we pass him when he is nearest to the sun\r\nwe see him at his best; not only because he is then nearest to\r\nus, but because he is then also most brightly lit. In such\r\nfavourable oppositions we are within 35 million miles of him; if\r\nMars was in aphelion we would pass him at a distance of 61\r\nmillion miles. Opposition occurs under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances every fifteen years. There was one in 1862, another\r\nin 1877, one in 1892, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen Mars is 35 million miles off and we apply a telescope\r\nmagnifying 1,000 diameters, we see him as if placed 35,000 miles\r\noff. This would be seven times nearer than we see the moon with\r\nthe naked eye. As Mars has a diameter about twice as great as\r\nthat of the moon, at such a distance he would look fourteen times\r\nthe diameter of the moon. Granting favourable conditions of\r\natmosphere much should be seen.\r\n\r\nBut these are just the conditions of atmosphere of which most of\r\nthe European observatories cannot boast. It is to the honour of\r\nSchiaparelli, of Milan, that under comparatively unfavourable\r\nconditions and with a small instrument, he so far outstripped his\r\ncontemporaries in the observation of the features of Mars that\r\nthose contemporaries received much of his early discoveries with\r\nscepticism. Light and dark outlines and patches on the planet's\r\nsurface had indeed been mapped by others, and even a couple of\r\nthe canals sighted; but at the opposition of 1877 Schiaparelli\r\nfirst mapped any considerable\r\n\r\n165\r\n\r\nnumber of the celebrated \"canals\" and showed that these\r\nconstituted an extraordinary and characteristic feature of the\r\nplanet's geography. He called them \"canali,\" meaning thereby\r\n\"channels.\" It is remarkable indeed that a mistranslation appears\r\nreally responsible for the initiation of the idea that these\r\nfeatures are canals.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Schiaparelli startled the astronomical world by declaring\r\nthat he saw some of the canals double--that is appearing as two\r\nparallel lines. As these lines span the planet's surface for\r\ndistances of many thousands of miles the announcement naturally\r\ngave rise to much surprise and, as I have said, to much\r\nscepticism. But he resolutely stuck to his statement. Here is his\r\nmap of 1882. It is sufficiently startling.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 he drew a new map. It adds a little to the former map,\r\nbut the doubling was not so well seen. It is just the strangest\r\nfeature about this doubling that at times it is conspicuous, at\r\ntimes invisible. A line which is distinctly seen as a single line\r\nat one time, a few weeks later will appear distinctly to consist\r\nof two parallel lines; like railway tracks, but tracks perhaps\r\n200 miles apart and up to 3,000 or even 4,000 miles in length.\r\n\r\nMany speculations were, of course, made to account for the origin\r\nof such features. No known surface peculiarity on the Earth or\r\nmoon at all resembles these features. The moon's surface as you\r\nknow is cracked and\r\n\r\n166\r\n\r\nstreaked. But the cracks are what we generally find cracks to\r\nbe--either aimless, wandering lines, or, if radiating from a\r\ncentre, then lines which contract in width as they leave the\r\npoint of rupture. Where will we find cracks accurately parallel\r\nto one another sweeping round a planet's face with steady\r\ncurvature for, 4,000 miles, and crossing each other as if quite\r\nunhampered by one another's presence? If the phenomenon on Mars\r\nbe due to cracks they imply a uniformity in thickness and\r\nstrength of crust, a homogeneity, quite beyond all anticipation.\r\nWe will afterwards see that the course of the lines is itself\r\nfurther opposed to the theory that haphazard cracking of the\r\ncrust of the planet is responsible for the lines. It was also\r\nsuggested that the surface of the planet was covered with ice and\r\nthat these were cracks in the ice. This theory has even greater\r\ndifficulties than the last to contend with. Rivers have been\r\nsuggested. A glance at our own maps at once disposes of this\r\nhypothesis. Rivers wander just as cracks do and parallel rivers\r\nlike parallel cracks are unknown.\r\n\r\nIn time the many suggestions were put aside. One only remained.\r\nThat the lines are actually the work of intelligence; actually\r\nare canals, artificially made, constructed for irrigation\r\npurposes on a scale of which we can hardly form any conception\r\nbased on our own earthly engineering structures.\r\n\r\nDuring the opposition of 1894, Percival Lowell, along with A. E.\r\nDouglass, and W. H. Pickering,\r\n\r\n167\r\n\r\nobserved the planet from the summit of a mountain in Arizona,\r\nusing an 18-inch refracting telescope and every resource of\r\ndelicate measurement and spectroscopy. So superb a climate\r\nfavoured them that for ten months the planet was kept under\r\ncontinual observation. Over 900 drawings were made and not only\r\nwere Schiaparelli's channels confirmed, but they added 116 to his\r\n79, on that portion of the planet visible at that opposition.\r\nThey made the further important discovery that the lines do not\r\nstop short at the dark regions of the planet's surface, as\r\nhitherto believed, but go right on in many cases; the curvature\r\nof the lines being unaltered.\r\n\r\nLowell is an uncompromising advocate of the \"canal\" theory. If\r\nhis arguments are correct we have at once an answer to our\r\nquestion, \"Are there other minds than ours?\"\r\n\r\nWe must consider a moment Lowell's arguments; not that it is my\r\nintention to combat them. You must form your own conclusions. I\r\nshall lay before you another and, as I venture to think, more\r\nadequate hypothesis in explanation of the channels of\r\nSchiaparelli. We learn, however, much from Lowell's book--it is\r\nfull of interest.[1]\r\n\r\nLowell lays a deep foundation. He begins by showing that Mars has\r\nan atmosphere. This must be granted him till some counter\r\nobservations are made.\r\n\r\n[1] _Mars_, by Percival Lowell (Longmans, Green & Co.), 1896,\r\n\r\n168\r\n\r\nIt is generally accepted. What that atmosphere is, is another\r\nmatter. He certainly has made out a good case for the presence of\r\nwater as one of its constituents,\r\n\r\nIt was long known that Mars possessed white regions at his poles,\r\njust as our Earth does. The waning of these polar snows--if indeed\r\nthey are such--with the advance of the Martian summer, had often\r\nbeen observed. Lowell plots day by day this waning. It is evident\r\nfrom his observations that the snowfall must be light indeed. We\r\nsee in his map the south pole turned towards us. Mars in\r\nperihelion always turns his south pole towards the sun and\r\ntherefore towards the Earth. We see that between the dates June\r\n3rd to August 3rd--or in two months--the polar snow had almost\r\ncompletely vanished. This denotes a very scanty covering. It must\r\nbe remembered that Mars even when nearest to the sun receives but\r\nhalf our supply of solar heat and light.\r\n\r\nBut other evidence exists to show that Mars probably possesses\r\nbut little water upon his surface. The dark places are not\r\nwater-covered, although they have been named as if they were,\r\nindeed, seas and lakes. Various phenomena show this. The canals\r\nshow it. It would never do to imagine canals crossing the seas.\r\nNo great rivers are visible. There is a striking absence of\r\nclouds. The atmosphere of Mars seems as serene as that of Venus\r\nappears to be cloudy. Mists and clouds, however, sometime appear\r\nto veil his face and add to the difficulty of\r\n\r\n169\r\n\r\nmaking observations near the limb of the planet. Lowell concludes\r\nit must be a calm and serene atmosphere; probably only\r\none-seventh of our own in density. The normal height of the\r\nbarometer in Mars would then be but four and a half inches. This\r\nis a pressure far less than exists on the top of the highest\r\nterrestrial mountain. A mountain here must have an altitude of\r\nabout ten miles to possess so low a pressure on its summit. Drops\r\nof water big enough to form rain can hardly collect in such a\r\nrarefied atmosphere. Moisture will fall as dew or frost upon the\r\nground. The days will be hot owing to the unimpeded solar\r\nradiation; the nights bitterly cold owing to the free radiation\r\ninto space.\r\n\r\nWe may add that in such a climate the frost will descend\r\nprincipally upon the high ground at night time and in the\r\nadvancing day it will melt. The freer radiation brings about this\r\nphenomenon among our own mountains in clear and calm weather.\r\n\r\nWith the progressive melting of the snow upon the pole Lowell\r\nconnected many phenomena upon the planet's surface of much\r\ninterest. The dark spaces appear to grow darker and more\r\ngreenish. The canals begin to show themselves and reveal their\r\ndouble nature. All this suggests that the moisture liberated by\r\nthe melting of the polar snow with the advancing year, is\r\ncarrying vitality and springtime over the surface of the planet.\r\nBut how is the water conveyed?\r\n\r\nLowell believes principally by the canals. These are\r\n\r\n170\r\n\r\nconstructed triangulating the surface of the planet in all\r\ndirections. What we see, according to Lowell, is not the canal\r\nitself, but the broad band of vegetation which springs up on the\r\narrival of the water. This band is perhaps thirty or forty miles\r\nwide, but perhaps much less, for Lowell reports that the better\r\nthe conditions of observation the finer the lines appeared, so\r\nthat they may be as narrow, possibly, as fifteen miles. It is to\r\nbe remarked that a just visible dot on the surface of Mars must\r\npossess a diameter of 30 miles. But a chain of much smaller dots\r\nwill be visible, just as we can see such fine objects as spiders'\r\nwebs. The widening of the canals is then accounted for, according\r\nto Lowell, by the growth of a band of vegetation, similar to that\r\nwhich springs into existence when the floods of the Nile irrigate\r\nthe plains of Egypt.\r\n\r\nIf no other explanation of the lines is forthcoming than that\r\nthey are the work of intelligence, all this must be remembered.\r\nIf all other theories fail us, much must be granted Lowell. We\r\nmust not reason like fishes--as Lowell puts it--and deny that\r\nintelligent beings can thrive in an atmospheric pressure of four\r\nand half inches of mercury. Zurbriggen has recently got to the\r\ntop of Aconcagua, a height of 24,000 feet. On the summit of such\r\na mountain the barometer must stand at about ten inches. Why\r\nshould not beings be developed by evolution with a lung capacity\r\ncapable of living at two and a half times this altitude. Those\r\nsteadily\r\n\r\n171\r\n\r\ncurved parallel lines are, indeed, very unlike anything we have\r\nexperience of. It would be rather to be expected that another\r\ncivilisation than our own would present many wide differences in\r\nits development.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the picture we have before us according to Lowell?\r\nIt is a sufficiently dramatic one.\r\n\r\nMars is a world whose water supply, never probably very abundant,\r\nhas through countless years been drying up, sinking into his\r\nsurface. But the inhabitants are making a brave fight for it,\r\nThey have constructed canals right round their world so that the\r\nwater, which otherwise would run to waste over the vast deserts,\r\nis led from oasis to oasis. Here the great centres of\r\ncivilisation are placed: their Londons, Viennas, New Yorks. These\r\ngigantic works are the works of despair. A great and civilised\r\nworld finds death staring it in the face. They have had to triple\r\ntheir canals so that when the central canal has done its work the\r\nwater is turned into the side canals, in order to utilise it as\r\nfar as possible. Through their splendid telescopes they must view\r\nour seas and ample rivers; and must die like travellers in the\r\ndesert seeing in a mirage the cool waters of a distant lake.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that lonely signal reported to have been seen in the\r\ntwilight limb of Mars was the outcome of pride in their splendid\r\nand perishing civilisation. They would leave some memory of it:\r\nthey would have us witness how great was that civilisation before\r\nthey perish!\r\n\r\nI close this dramatic picture with the poor comfort\r\n\r\n172\r\n\r\nthat several philanthropic people have suggested signalling to\r\nthem as a mark of sympathy. It is said that a fortune was\r\nbequeathed to the French Academy for the purpose of communicating\r\nwith the Martians. It has been suggested that we could flash\r\nsignals to them by means of gigantic mirrors reflecting the light\r\nof our Sun. Or, again, that we might light bonfires on a\r\nsufficiently large scale. They would have to be about ten miles\r\nin diameter! A writer in the Pall Mall Gazette suggested that\r\nthere need really be no difficulty in the matter. With the kind\r\ncooperation of the London Gas Companies (this was before the days\r\nof electric lighting) a signal might be sent without any\r\nadditional expense if the gas companies would consent to\r\nsimultaneously turn off the gas at intervals of five minutes over\r\nthe whole of London, a signal which would be visible to the\r\nastronomers in Mars would result. He adds, naively: \"If only\r\ntried for an hour each night some results might be obtained.\"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed the theory of the artificial construction of the\r\nMartian lines. The amount of consideration we are disposed to\r\ngive to the supposition that there are upon Mars other minds than\r\nours will--as I have stated--necessarily depend upon whether or not\r\nwe can assign a probable explanation of the lines upon purely\r\nphysical grounds. If it is apparent that such\r\n\r\n173\r\n\r\nlines would be formed with great probability under certain\r\nconditions, which conditions are themselves probable, then the\r\nargument by exclusion for the existence of civilisation on Mars,\r\nat once breaks down.\r\n\r\n{Fig. 10}\r\n\r\nAs a romance writer is sometimes under the necessity of\r\ntransporting his readers to other scenes, so I must now ask you\r\nto consent to be transported some millions\r\n\r\n174\r\n\r\nof miles into the region of the heavens which lies outside Mars'\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nBetween Mars and Jupiter is a chasm of 341 millions of miles.\r\nThis gap in the sequence of planets was long known to be quite\r\nout of keeping with the orderly succession of worlds outward from\r\nthe Sun. A society was formed at the close of the last century\r\nfor the detection of the missing world. On the first day of the\r\nlast century, Piazzi--who, by the way, was not a member of the\r\nsociety--discovered a tiny world in the vacant gap. Although\r\neagerly welcomed, as better than nothing, it was a disappointing\r\nfind. The new world was a mere rock. A speck of about 160 miles\r\nin diameter. It was obviously never intended that such a body\r\nshould have all this space to itself. And, sure enough, shortly\r\nafter, another small world was discovered. Then another was\r\nfound, and another, and so on; and now more than 400 of these\r\nstrange little worlds are known.\r\n\r\nBut whence came such bodies? The generally accepted belief is\r\nthat these really represent a misbegotten world. When the Sun was\r\nyounger he shed off the several worlds of our system as so many\r\nrings. Each ring then coalesced into a world. Neptune being the\r\nfirst born; Mercury the youngest born.\r\n\r\nAfter Jupiter was thrown off, and the Sun had shrunk away inwards\r\nsome 20o million miles, he shed off another ring. Meaning that\r\nthis offspring of his should grow up like the rest, develop into\r\na stable world with the\r\n\r\n175\r\n\r\npotentiality even, it may be, of becoming the abode of rational\r\nbeings. But something went wrong. It broke up into a ring of\r\nlittle bodies, circulating around him.\r\n\r\nIt is probable on this hypothesis that the number we are\r\nacquainted with does not nearly represent the actual number of\r\npast and present asteroids. It would take 125,000 of the biggest\r\nof them to make up a globe as big as our world. They, so far as\r\nthey are known, vary in size from 10 miles to 160 miles in\r\ndiameter. It is probable then--on the assumption that this failure\r\nof a world was intended to be about the mass of our Earth--that\r\nthey numbered, and possibly number, many hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\nSome of these little bodies are very peculiar in respect to the\r\norbits they move in. This peculiarity is sometimes in the\r\neccentricity of their orbits, sometimes in the manner in which\r\ntheir orbits are tilted to the general plane of the ecliptic, in\r\nwhich all the other planets move.\r\n\r\nThe eccentricity, according to Proctor, in some cases may attain\r\nsuch extremes as to bring the little world inside Mars' mean\r\ndistance from the sun. This, as you will remember, is very much\r\nless than his greatest distance from the sun. The entire belt of\r\nasteroids--as known--lie much nearer to Mars than to Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAs regards the tilt of their orbits, some are actually as much as\r\n34 degrees inclined to the ecliptic, so that in fact they are\r\nseen from the Earth among our polar constellations.\r\n\r\n176\r\n\r\nFrom all this you see that Mars occupies a rather hot comer in\r\nthe solar system. Is it not possible that more than once in the\r\nremote past Mars may have encountered one of these wanderers? If\r\nhe came within a certain distance of the small body his great\r\nmass would sway it from its orbit, and under certain conditions\r\nhe would pick up a satellite in this manner. That his present\r\nsatellites were actually so acquired is the suggestion of Newton,\r\nof Yale College.\r\n\r\nMars' satellites are indeed suspiciously and most abnormally\r\nsmall. I have not time to prove this to you by comparison with\r\nthe other worlds of the solar system. In fact, they were not\r\ndiscovered till 1877--although they were predicted in a most\r\ncurious manner, with the most uncannily accurate details, by\r\nSwift.\r\n\r\nOne of these bodies is about 36 miles in diameter. This is\r\nPhobos. Phobos is only 3.700 miles from the surface of Mars. The\r\nother is smaller and further off. He is named Deimos, and his\r\ndiameter is only 10 miles. He is 12,500 miles from Mars' surface.\r\nWith the exception of Phobos the next smallest satellite known in\r\nthe solar system is one of Saturn's--Hyperion; almost 800 miles in\r\ndiameter. The inner one goes all round Mars in 7½ hours. This is\r\nPhobos' month. Mars turns on his axis in 24 hours and 40 minutes,\r\nso that people in Mars would see the rise of Phobos twice in the\r\ncourse of a day and night; lie would apparently cross the sky\r\n\r\n177\r\n\r\ngoing against the other satellite; that is, he would move\r\napparently from west to east.\r\n\r\nWe may at least assume as probable that other satellites have\r\nbeen gathered by Mars in the past from the army of asteroids.\r\n\r\nSome of the satellites so picked up would be direct: that is,\r\nwould move round the planet in the direction of his axial\r\nrotation. Others, on the chances, would be retrograde: that is,\r\nwould move against his axial rotation. They would describe orbits\r\nmaking the same various angles with the ecliptic as do the\r\nasteroids; and we may be sure they would be of the same varying\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nWe go on to inquire what would be the consequence to Mars of such\r\ncaptures.\r\n\r\nA satellite captured in this manner is very likely to be pulled\r\ninto the Planet. This is a probable end of a satellite in any\r\ncase. It will probably be the end of our satellite too. The\r\nsatellite Phobos is indeed believed to be about to take this very\r\nplunge into his planet. But in the case when the satellite picked\r\nup happens to be rotating round the planet in the opposite\r\ndirection to the axial rotation of the planet, it is pretty\r\ncertain that its career as a satellite will be a brief one. The\r\nreasons for this I cannot now give. If, then, Mars picked up\r\nsatellites he is very sure to have absorbed them sooner or later.\r\nSooner if they happened to be retrograde satellites, later if\r\ndirect satellites. His present satellites are recent additions.\r\nThey are direct.\r\n\r\n178\r\n\r\nThe path of an expiring satellite will be a slow spiral described\r\nround the planet. The spiral will at last, after many years,\r\nbring the satellite down upon the surface of the primary. Its\r\nfinal approach will be accelerated if the planet possesses an\r\natmosphere, as Mars probably does. A satellite of the dimensions\r\nof Phobos--that is 36 miles in diameter--would hardly survive more\r\nthan 30 to 60 years within seventy miles of Mars' surface. It\r\nwill then be rotating round Mars in an hour and forty minutes,\r\nmoving, in fact, at the rate of 2.2 miles per second. In the\r\ncourse of this 30 or 60 years it will, therefore, get round\r\nperhaps 200,000 times, before it finally crashes down upon the\r\nMartians. During this closing history of the satellite there is\r\nreason to believe, however, that it would by no means pursue\r\ncontinually the same path over the surface of the planet. There\r\nare many disturbing factors to be considered. Being so small any\r\nlarge surface features of Mars would probably act to perturb the\r\norbit of the satellite.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of Mars' lines which I suggest, is that they were\r\nformed by the approach of such satellites in former times. I do\r\nnot mean that they are lines cut into his surface by the actual\r\ninfall of a satellite. The final end of the satellite would be\r\ntoo rapid for this, I think. But I hope to be able to show you\r\nthat there is reason to believe that the mere passage of the\r\nsatellite, say at 70 miles above the surface of the planet, will,\r\nin itself, give rise to effects on the crust of the planet\r\ncapable\r\n\r\n179\r\n\r\nof accounting for just such single or parallel lines as we see.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we have to consider the stability of the\r\nsatellite. Even in the case of a small satellite we cannot\r\noverlook the fact that the half of the satellite near the planet\r\nis pulled towards the planet by a gravitational force greater\r\nthan that attracting the outer half, and that the centrifugal\r\nforce is less on the inner than on the outer hemisphere. Hence\r\nthere exists a force tending to tear the satellite asunder on the\r\nequatorial section tangential\r\n\r\n{Fig. 11}\r\n\r\nto the planet's surface. If in a fluid or plastic state, Phobos,\r\nfor instance, could not possibly exist near the planet's surface.\r\nThe forces referred to would decide its fate. It may be shown by\r\ncalculation, however, that if Phobos has the strength of basalt\r\nor glass there would remain a considerable coefficient of safety\r\nin favour of the satellite's stability; even when the surfaces of\r\nplanet and satellite were separated by only five miles.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider some things which we expect will happen\r\nbefore the satellite takes its final plunge into the planet.\r\n\r\n180\r\n\r\nThis diagram (Fig. 11) shows you the satellite travelling above\r\nthe surface of the planet. The satellite is advancing towards, or\r\naway from, the spectator. The planet is supposed to show its\r\nsolid crust in cross section, which may be a few miles in\r\nthickness. Below this is such a hot plastic magma as we have\r\nreason to believe underlies much of the solid crust of our own\r\nEarth. Now there is an attraction between the satellite and the\r\ncrust of the planet; the same gravitational attraction which\r\nexists between every particle of matter in the universe. Let us\r\nconsider how this attraction will affect the planet's crust. I\r\nhave drawn little arrows to show how we may consider the\r\nattraction of the satellite pulling the crust of the planet not\r\nonly upwards, but also pulling it inwards beneath the satellite.\r\nI have made these arrows longer where calculation shows the\r\nstress is greater. You see that the greatest lifting stress is\r\njust beneath the satellite, whereas the greatest stress pulling\r\nthe crust in under the satellite is at a point which lies out\r\nfrom under the satellite, at a considerable distance. At each\r\nside of the satellite there is a point where the stress pulling\r\non the crust is the greatest. Of the two stresses the lifting\r\nstress will tend to raise the crust a little; the pulling stress\r\nmay in certain cases actually tear the crust across; as at A and\r\nB.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to calculate the amount of the stress at the point\r\nat each side of the satellite where the stress is at its\r\ngreatest. We must assume the satellite to be a certain size and\r\ndensity; we must also assume the crust of\r\n\r\n181\r\n\r\nMars to be of some certain density. To fix our ideas on these\r\npoints I take the case of the present satellite Phobos. What\r\namount of stress will he exert upon the crust of Mars when he\r\napproaches within, say, 40 miles of the planet's surface? We know\r\nhis size approximately--he is about 36 miles in diameter. We can\r\nguess his density to be between four times that of water and\r\neight times that of water. We may assume the density of Mars'\r\nsurface to be about the same as that of our Earth's surface, that\r\nis three times as dense as water. We now find that the greatest\r\nstress tending to rend open the surface crust of Mars will be\r\nbetween 4,000 and 8,000 pounds to the square foot according to\r\nthe density we assign to Phobos.\r\n\r\nWill such a stress actually tear open the crust? We are not able\r\nto answer this question with any certainty. Much will depend upon\r\nthe nature and condition of the crust. Thus, suppose that we are\r\nhere (Fig. 12) looking down upon the satellite which is moving\r\nalong slowly relatively to Mars' surface, in the direction of the\r\narrow. The satellite has just passed over a weak and cracked part\r\nof the planet's crust. Here the stress has been sufficient to\r\nstart two cracks. Now you know how easy it is to tear a piece of\r\ncloth when you go to the edge of it in order to make a beginning.\r\nHere the stress from the satellite has got to the edge of the\r\ncrust. It is greatly concentrated just at the extremities of the\r\ncracks. It will, unler such circumstances probably carry on the\r\n\r\n182\r\n\r\ntear. If it does not do so this time, remember the satellite will\r\nsome hours later be coming over the same place again, and then\r\nagain for, at least, many hundreds of times. Then also we are not\r\nlimited to the assumption that the\r\n\r\n{Fig. 12}\r\n\r\nsatellite is as small as Phobos. Suppose we consider the case of\r\na satellite approaching Mars which has a diameter double that of\r\nPhobos; a diameter still much less than that of the larger class\r\nof asteroids. Even at the distance\r\n\r\n183\r\n\r\nof 65 miles the stress will now amount to as much as from 15 to\r\n30 tons per square foot. It is almost certain that such a stress\r\nrepeated a comparatively few times over the same parts of the\r\nplanet's surface would so rend the crust as to set up lines along\r\nwhich plutonic action would find a vent. That is, we might expect\r\nalong these lines all the phenomena of upheaval and volcanic\r\neruption which give rise to surface elevations.\r\n\r\nThe probable effect of a satellite of this dimension travelling\r\nslowly relatively to the surface of Mars is, then, to leave a\r\nvery conspicuous memorial of his presence behind him. You see\r\nfrom the diagram that this memorial will consist o: two parallel\r\nlines of disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe linear character of the gravitational effects of the\r\nsatellite is due entirely to the motion of the satellite\r\nrelatively to the surface of the planet. If the satellite stood\r\nstill above the surface the gravitational stress in the crust\r\nwould, of course, be exerted radially outwards from the centre of\r\nthe satellite. It would attain at the central point beneath the\r\nsatellite its maximum vertical effect, and at some radial\r\ndistance measured outwards from this point, which distance we can\r\ncalculate, its maximum horizontal tearing effect. When the\r\nsatellite moves relatively to the planet's crust, the horizontal\r\ntearing force acts differently according to whether it is\r\ndirected in the line of motion or at right angles to this line.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of motion we see that the satellite\r\n\r\n184\r\n\r\ncreates as it passes over the crust a wave of rarefaction or\r\ntension as at D, followed by compression just beneath the\r\nsatellite and by a reversed direction of gravitational pull as\r\nthe satellite passes onwards. These stresses rapidly replace one\r\nanother as the satellite travels along. They are resisted by the\r\ninertia of the crust, and are taken up by its elasticity. The\r\nnature of this succession of alternate compressions and\r\nrarefactions in the crust possess some resemblance to those\r\narising in an earthquake shock.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the effects taking place laterally to the line of\r\nmotion we see that there are no such changes in the nature of the\r\nforces in the crust. At each passage of the satellite the\r\nhorizontal tearing stress increases to a maximum, when it is\r\nexerted laterally, along the line passing through the horizontal\r\nprojection of the satellite and at right angles to the line of\r\nmotion, and again dies away. It is always a tearing stress,\r\nrenewed again and again.\r\n\r\nThis effect is at its maximum along two particular parallel lines\r\nwhich are tangents to the circle of maximum horizontal stress and\r\nwhich run parallel with the path of the satellite. The distance\r\nseparating these lines depend upon the elevation of the satellite\r\nabove the planet's surface. Such lines mark out the theoretical\r\naxes of the \"double canals\" which future crustal movements will\r\nmore fully develop.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to consider what the effect of such\r\n\r\n185\r\n\r\nconditions would be if they arose at the surface of our own\r\nplanet. We assume a horizontal force in the crust adequate to set\r\nup tensile stresses of the order, say, of fifteen tons to the\r\nsquare foot and these stresses to be repeated every few hours;\r\nour world being also subject to the dynamic effects we recognise\r\nin and beneath its crust.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that the areas over which the satellite exerted\r\nits gravitational stresses must become the foci --foci of linear\r\nform--of tectonic developments or crust movements. The relief of\r\nstresses, from whatever cause arising, in and beneath the crust\r\nmust surely take place in these regions of disturbance and along\r\nthese linear areas. Here must become concentrated the folding\r\nmovements, which are under existing conditions brought into the\r\ngeosynclines, along with their attendant volcanic phenomena. In\r\nthe case of Mars such a concentration of tectonic events would\r\nnot, owing to the absence of extensive subaerial denudation and\r\ngreat oceans, be complicated by the existence of such synclinal\r\naccumulations as have controlled terrestrial surface development.\r\nWith the passage of time the linear features would probably\r\ndevelop; the energetic substratum continually asserting its\r\ninfluence along such lines of weakness. It is in the highest\r\ndegree probable that radioactivity plays no less a part in\r\nMartian history than in terrestrial. The fact of radioactive\r\nheating allows us to assume the thin surface crust and continued\r\nsub-crustal energy throughout the entire period of the planet's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n186\r\n\r\nHow far willl these effects resemble the double canals of Mars?\r\nIn this figure and in the calculations I have given you I have\r\nsupposed the satellite engaged in marking the planet's surface\r\nwith two lines separated by about the interval separating the\r\nwider double canals of Mars--that is about 220 miles apart. What\r\nthe distance between the lines will be, as already stated, will\r\ndepend upon the height of the satellite above the surface when it\r\ncomes upon a part of the crust in a condition to be affected by\r\nthe stresses it sets up in it. If the satellite does its work at\r\na point lower down above the surface the canal produced will be\r\nnarrower. The stresses, too, will then be much greater. I must\r\nalso observe that once the crust has yielded to the pulling\r\nstress, there is great probability that in future revolutions of\r\nthe satellite a central fracture will result. For then all the\r\npulling force adds itself to the lifting force and tends to crush\r\nthe crust inwards on the central line beneath the satellite. It\r\nis thus quite possible that the passage of a satellite may give\r\nrise to triple lines. There is reason to believe that the canals\r\non Mars are in some cases triple.\r\n\r\nI have spoken all along of the satellite moving slowly over the\r\nsurface of Mars. I have done so as I cannot at all pronounce so\r\nreadily on what will happen when the satellite's velocity over\r\nthe surface of Mars is very great. To account for all the lines\r\nmapped by Lowell some of them must have been produced by\r\nsatellities moving relatively to the surface of Mars at\r\nvelocities so great\r\n\r\n187\r\n\r\nas three miles a second or even rather more. The stresses set up\r\nare, in such cases, very difficult to estimate. It has not yet\r\nbeen done. Parallel lines of greatest stress or impulse ought to\r\nbe formed as in the other case.\r\n\r\nI now ask your attention to another kind of evidence that the\r\nlines are due in some way to the motion of satellites passing\r\nover the surface of Mars.\r\n\r\nI may put the fresh evidence to which I refer, in this way: In\r\nLowell's map (P1. XXII, p. 192), and in a less degree in\r\nSchiaparelli's map (ante p. 166), we are given the course of the\r\nlines as fragments of incomplete curves. Now these curves might\r\nhave been anything at all. We must take them as they are,\r\nhowever, when we apply them as a test of the theory that the\r\nmotion of a satellite round Mars can strike such lines. If it can\r\nbe shown that satellites revolving round Mars might strike just\r\nsuch curves then we assume this as an added confirmation of the\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nWe must begin by realising what sort of curves a satellite which\r\ndisturbs the surface of a planet would leave behind it after its\r\ndemise. You might think that the satellite revolving round and\r\nround the planet must simply describe a circle upon the spherical\r\nsurface of the planet: a \"great circle\" as it is called; that is\r\nthe greatest circle which can be described upon a sphere. This\r\ngreat circle can, however, only be struck, as you will see, when\r\nthe planet is not turning upon its axis: a condition not likely\r\nto be realised.\r\n\r\nThis diagram (PI. XXI) shows the surface of a globe\r\n\r\n188\r\n\r\ncovered with the usual imaginary lines of latitude and longitude.\r\nThe orbit of a supposed satellite is shown by a line crossing the\r\nsphere at some assumed angle with the equator. Along this line\r\nthe satellite always moves at uniform velocity, passing across\r\nand round the back of the sphere and again across. If the sphere\r\nis not turning on its polar axis then this satellite, which we\r\nwill suppose armed with a pencil which draws a line upon the\r\nsphere, will strike a great circle right round the sphere. But\r\nthe sphere is rotating. And it is to be expected that at\r\ndifferent times in a planet's history the rate of rotation varies\r\nvery much indeed. There is reason to believe that our own day was\r\nonce only 2½ hours long, or thereabouts. After a preliminary rise\r\nin velocity of axial rotation, due to shrinkage attending rapid\r\ncooling, a planet as it advances in years rotates slower and\r\nslower. This phenomenon is due to tidal influences of the sun or\r\nof satellites. On the assumption that satellites fell into Mars\r\nthere would in his case be a further action tending to shorten\r\nhis day as time went on.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the rotation of the planet will be, of course, that\r\nas the satellite advances with its pencil it finds the surface of\r\nthe sphere being displaced from under it. The line struck ceases\r\nto be the great circle but wanders off in another curve--which is\r\nin fact not a circle at all.\r\n\r\nYou will readily see how we find this curve. Suppose the sphere\r\nto be rotating at such a speed that while the satellite is\r\nadvancing the distance _Oa_, the point _b_ on the\r\n\r\n189\r\n\r\nsphere will be carried into the path of the satellite. The pencil\r\nwill mark this point. Similarly we find that all the points along\r\nthis full curved line are points which will just find themselves\r\nunder the satellite as it passes with its pencil. This curve is\r\nthen the track marked out by the revolving satellite. You see it\r\ndotted round the back of the sphere to where it cuts the equator\r\nat a certain point. The course of the curve and the point where\r\nit cuts the equator, before proceeding on its way, entirely\r\ndepend upon the rate at which we suppose the sphere to be\r\nrotating and the satellite to be describing the orbit. We may\r\ncall the distance measured round the planet's equator separating\r\nthe starting point of the curve from the point at which it again\r\nmeets the equator, the \"span\" of the curve. The span then depends\r\nentirely upon the rate of rotation of the planet on its axis and\r\nof the satellite in its orbit round the planet.\r\n\r\nBut the nature of events might have been somewhat different. The\r\nsatellite is, in the figure, supposed to be rotating round the\r\nsphere in the same direction as that in which the sphere is\r\nturning. It might have been that Mars had picked up a satellite\r\ntravelling in the opposite direction to that in which he was\r\nturning. With the velocity of planet on its axis and of satellite\r\nin its orbit the same as before, a different curve would have\r\nbeen described. The span of the curve due to a retrograde\r\nsatellite will be greater than that due to a direct satellite.\r\nThe retrograde satellite will have a span more than half\r\n\r\n190\r\n\r\nway round the planet, the direct satellite will describe a curve\r\nwhich will be less than half way round the planet: that is a span\r\ndue to a retrograde satellite will be more than 180 degrees,\r\nwhile the span due to a direct satellite will be less than 180\r\ndegrees upon the planet's equator.\r\n\r\nI would draw your attention to the fact that what the span will\r\nbe does not depend upon how much the orbit of the satellite is\r\ninclined to the equator. This only decides how far the curve\r\nmarked out by the satellite will recede from the equator.\r\n\r\nWe find then, so far, that it is easy to distinguish between the\r\ndirect and the retrograde curves. The span of one is less, of the\r\nother greater, than 180 degrees. The number of degrees which\r\neither sort of curve subtends upon the equator entirely depends\r\nupon the velocity of the satellite and the axial velocity of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nBut of these two velocities that of the satellite may be taken as\r\nsensibly invariable, when close enough to use his pencil. This\r\ndepends upon the law of centrifugal force, which teaches us that\r\nthe mass of the planet alone decides the velocity of a satellite\r\nin its orbit at any fixed distance from the planet's centre. The\r\nother velocity--that of the planet upon its axis--was, as we have\r\nseen, not in the past what it is now. If then Mars, at various\r\ntimes in his past history, picked up satellites, these satellites\r\nwill describe curves round him having different spans which will\r\ndepend upon the velocity of axial rotation of Mars at the time\r\nand upon this only.\r\n\r\n191\r\n\r\nIn what way now can we apply this knowledge of the curves\r\ndescribed by a satellite as a test of the lunar origin of the\r\nlines on Mars?\r\n\r\nTo do this we must apply to Lowell's map. We pick out preferably,\r\nof course, the most complete and definite curves. The chain of\r\ncanals of which Acheron and Erebus are members mark out a fairly\r\ndefinite curve. We produce it by eye, preserving the curvature as\r\nfar as possible, till it cuts the equator. Reading the span on\r\nthe equator we find' it to be 255 degrees. In the first place we\r\nsay then that this curve is due to a retrograde satellite. We\r\nalso note on Lowell's map that the greatest rise of the curve is\r\nto a point about 32 degrees north of the equator. This gives the\r\ninclination of the satellite's orbit to the plane of Mars'\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nWith these data we calculate the velocity which the planet must\r\nhave possessed at the time the canal was formed on the hypothesis\r\nthat the curve was indeed the work of a satellite. The final\r\nquestion now remains If we determine the curve due to this\r\nvelocity of Mars on its axis, will this curve fit that one which\r\nappears on Lowell's map, and of which we have really availed\r\nourselves of only three points? To answer this question we plot\r\nupon a sphere, the curve of a satellite, in the manner I have\r\ndescribed, assigning to this sphere the velocity derived from the\r\nspan of 255 degrees. Having plotted the curve on the sphere it\r\nonly remains to transfer it to Lowell's map. This is easily\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n192\r\n\r\nThis map (Pl. XXII) shows you the result of treating this, as\r\nwell as other curves, in the manner just described. You see that\r\nwhether the fragmentary curves are steep and receding far from\r\nthe equator; or whether they are flat and lying close along the\r\nequator; whether they span less or more than 180 degrees; the\r\ncurves determined on the supposition that they are the work of\r\nsatellites revolving round Mars agree with the mapped curves;\r\nfollowing them with wonderful accuracy; possessing their\r\nproperties, and, indeed, in some cases, actually coinciding with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI may add that the inadmissible span of 180 degrees and spans\r\nvery near this value, which are not well admissible, are so far\r\nas I can find, absent. The curves are not great circles.\r\n\r\nYou will require of me that I should explain the centres of\r\nradiation so conspicuous here and there on Lowell's map. The\r\nmeeting of more than two lines at the oases is a phenomenon\r\npossibly of the same nature and also requiring explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the curves to which I have but briefly\r\nreferred actually give rise in most cases to nodal, or crossing\r\npoints; sometimes on the equator, sometimes off the equator;\r\nthrough which the path of the satellite returns again and again.\r\nThese nodal points will not, however, afford a general\r\nexplanation of the many-branched radiants.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that we should refer such an appearance\r\n\r\n193\r\n\r\nas is shown at the Sinus Titanum to the perturbations of the\r\nsatellite's path due to the surface features on Mars. Observe\r\nthat the principal radiants are situated upon the boundary of the\r\ndark regions or at the oases. Higher surface levels may be\r\ninvolved in both cases. Some marked difference in topography must\r\ncharacterise both these features. The latter may possibly\r\noriginate in the destruction of satellites. Or again, they may\r\narise in crustal disturbance of a volcanic nature, primarily\r\ninduced or localised by the crossing of two canals. Whatever the\r\norigin of these features it is only necessary to assume that they\r\nrepresent elevated features of some magnitude to explain the\r\nmultiplication of crossing lines. We must here recall what\r\nobservers say of the multiplicity of the canals. According to\r\nLowell, \"What their number maybe lies quite beyond the\r\npossibility of count at present; for the better our own air, the\r\nmore of them are visible.\"\r\n\r\nSuch innumerable canals are just what the present theory\r\nrequires. An in-falling satellite will, in the course of the last\r\n60 or 80 years of its career, circulate some 100,000 times over\r\nMars' surface. Now what will determine the more conspicuous\r\ndevelopment of a particular canal? The mass of the satellite; the\r\nstate of the surface crust; the proximity of the satellite; and\r\nthe amount of repetition over the same ground. The after effects\r\nmay be taken as proportional to the primary disturbance.\r\n\r\n194\r\n\r\nIt is probable that elevated surface features will influence two\r\nof these conditions: the number of repetitions and the proximity\r\nto the surface. A tract 100 miles in diameter and elevated 5,000\r\nor 10,000 feet would seriously perturb the orbit of such a body as\r\nPhobos. It is to be expected that not only would it be effective\r\nin swaying the orbit of the satellite in the horizontal direction\r\nbut also would draw it down closer to the surface. It is even to\r\nbe considered if such a mass might not become nodal to the\r\nsatellite's orbit, so that this passed through or above this\r\npoint at various inclinations with its primary direction. If\r\nacting to bring down the orbit then this will quicken the speed\r\nand cause the satellite further on its path to attain a somewhat\r\nhigher elevation above the surface. The lines most conspicuous in\r\nthe telescope are, in short, those which have been favoured by a\r\ncombination of circumstances as reviewed above, among which\r\ncrustal features have, in some cases, played a part.\r\n\r\nI must briefly refer to what is one of the most interesting\r\nfeatures of the Martian lines: the manner in which they appear to\r\ncome and go like visions.\r\n\r\nSomething going on in Mars determines the phenomenon. On a\r\nparticular night a certain line looks single. A few nights later\r\nsigns of doubling are perceived, and later still, when the seeing\r\nis particularly good, not one but two lines are seen. Thus, as an\r\nexample, we may take the case of Phison and Euphrates. Faint\r\nglimpses of the dual state were detected in the summer\r\n\r\n195\r\n\r\nand autumn, but not till November did they appear as distinctly\r\ndouble. Observe that by this time the Antarctic snows had melted,\r\nand there was in addition, sufficient time for the moisture so\r\nliberated to become diffused in the planet's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis increase in the definition and conspicuousness of certain\r\ndetails on Mars' surface is further brought into connection with\r\nthe liberation of the polar snows and the diffusion of this water\r\nthrough the atmosphere, by the fact that the definition appeared\r\nprogressively better from the south pole upwards as the snow\r\ndisappeared. Lowell thinks this points to vegetation springing up\r\nunder the influence of moisture; he considers, however, as we\r\nhave seen, that the canals convey the moisture. He has to assume\r\nthe construction of triple canals to explain the doubling of the\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIf we once admit the canals to be elevated ranges--not necessarily\r\nof great height--the difficulty of accounting for increased\r\ndefinition with increase of moisture vanishes. We need not\r\nnecessarily even suppose vegetation concerned. With respect to\r\nthis last possibility we may remark that the colour observations,\r\nupon which the idea of vegetation is based, are likely to be\r\nuncertain owing to possible fatigue effects where a dark object\r\nis seen against a reddish background.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be we have to consider what the effects of\r\nmoisture increasing in the atmosphere of Mars will be with regard\r\nto the visibility of elevated ranges,\r\n\r\n196\r\n\r\nWe assume a serene and rare atmosphere: the nights intensely\r\ncold, the days hot with the unveiled solar radiation. On the hill\r\ntops the cold of night will be still more intense and so, also,\r\nwill the solar radiation by day. The result of this state of\r\nthings will be that the moisture will be precipitated mainly on\r\nthe mountains during the cold of night--in the form of frost--and\r\nduring the day this covering of frost will melt; and, just as we\r\nsee a heavy dew-fall darken the ground in summer, so the melting\r\nice will set off the elevated land against the arid plains below.\r\nOur valleys are more moist than our mountains only because our\r\nmoisture is so abundant that it drains off the mountains into the\r\nvalleys. If moisture was scarce it would distil from the plains\r\nto the colder elevations of the hills. On this view the\r\naccentuation of a canal is the result of meteorological effects\r\nsuch as would arise in the Martian climate; effects which must be\r\ninfluenced by conditions of mountain elevation, atmospheric\r\ncurrents, etc. We, thus, follow Lowell in ascribing the\r\naccentuation of the canals to the circulation of water in Mars;\r\nbut we assume a simple and natural mode of conveyance and do not\r\npostulate artificial structures of all but impossible magnitude.\r\nThat vegetation may take part in the darkening of the elevated\r\ntracts is not improbable. Indeed we would expect that in the\r\nMartian climate these tracts would be the only fertile parts of\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nClouds also there certainly are. More recent observations\r\n\r\n197\r\n\r\nappear to have set this beyond doubt. Their presence obviously\r\nbrings in other possible explanations of the coming and going of\r\nelevated surface features.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may ask what about the reliability of the maps? About\r\nthis it is to be said that the most recent map--that by Lowell--has\r\nbeen confirmed by numerous drawings by different observers, and\r\nthat it is,itself the result of over 900 drawings. It has become\r\na standard chart of Mars, and while it would be rash to contend\r\nfor absence of errors it appears certain that the trend of the\r\nprincipal canals may be relied on, as, also, the general features\r\nof the planet's surface.\r\n\r\nThe question of the possibility of illusion has frequently been\r\nraised. What I have said above to a great extent answers such\r\nobjections. The close agreement between the drawings of different\r\nobservers ought really to set the matter at rest. Recently,\r\nhowever, photography has left no further room for scepticism.\r\nFirst photographed in 1905, the planet has since been\r\nphotographed many thousands of times from various observatories.\r\nA majority of the canals have been so mapped. The doubling of the\r\ncanals is stated to have been also so recorded.[1]\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis which I have ventured to put before you involves\r\nno organic intervention to account for the\r\n\r\n[1] E. C. Slipher's paper in _Popular Astronomy_ for March, 1914,\r\ngives a good account of the recent work.\r\n\r\n198\r\n\r\ndetails on Mars' surface. They are physical surface features.\r\nMars presents his history written upon his face in the scars of\r\nformer encounters--like the shield of Sir Launcelot. Some of the\r\nmost interesting inferences of mathematical and physical\r\nastronomy find a confirmation in his history. The slowing down in\r\nthe rate of axial rotation of the primary; the final inevitable\r\ndestruction of the satellite; the existence in the past of a far\r\nlarger number of asteroids than we at present are acquainted\r\nwith; all these great facts are involved in the theory now\r\nadvanced. If justifiably, then is Mars' face a veritable\r\nPrincipia.\r\n\r\nTo fully answer the question which heads these lectures, we\r\nshould go out into the populous solitudes (if the term be\r\npermitted) which lie beyond our system. It is well that there is\r\nnow no time left to do so; for, in fact, there we can only dream\r\ndreams wherein the limits of the possible and the impossible\r\nbecome lost.\r\n\r\nThe marvel of the infinite number of stars is not so marvellous\r\nas the rationality that fain would comprehend them. In seeking\r\nother minds than ours we seek for what is almost infinitely\r\ncomplex and coordinated in a material universe relatively simple\r\nand heterogeneous. In our mental attitude towards the great\r\nquestion, this fact must be regarded as fundamental.\r\n\r\nI can only fitly close a discourse which has throughout weighed\r\nthe question of the living thought against the unthinking laws of\r\nmatter, by a paraphrase of the words\r\n\r\n199\r\n\r\nof a great poet when he, in higher and, perhaps, more philosophic\r\nlanguage, also sought to place the one in comparison with the\r\nother.[1]\r\n\r\nRichter thought that he was--with his human heart\r\nunstrengthened--taken by an angel among the universe of stars.\r\nThen, as they journeyed, our solar system was sunken like a faint\r\nstar in the abyss, and they travelled yet further, on the wings\r\nof thought, through mightier systems: through all the countless\r\nnumbers of our galaxy. But at length these also were left behind,\r\nand faded like a mist into the past. But this was not all. The\r\ndawn of other galaxies appeared in the void. Stars more countless\r\nstill with insufferable light emerged. And these also were\r\npassed. And so they went through galaxies without number till at\r\nlength they stood in the great Cathedral of the Universe. Endless\r\nwere the starry aisles; endless the starry columns; infinite the\r\narches and the architraves of stars. And the poet saw the mighty\r\ngalaxies as steps descending to infinity, and as steps going up\r\nto infinity.\r\n\r\nThen his human heart fainted and he longed for some narrow cell;\r\nlonged to lie down in the grave that he might hide from infinity.\r\nAnd he said to the angel:\r\n\r\n\"Angel, I can go with thee no farther. Is there, then, no end to\r\nthe universe of stars?\"\r\n\r\n[1] De Quincy in his _System of the Heavens_ gives a fine\r\nparaphrase of \"Richter's Dream.\"\r\n\r\n200\r\n\r\nThen the angel flung up his glorious hands to the heaven of\r\nheavens, saying \"End is there none to the universe of God? Lo!\r\nalso there is no beginning.\"\r\n\r\n201\r\n\r\nTHE LATENT IMAGE [1]\r\n\r\nMy inclination has led me, in spite of a lively dread of\r\nincurring a charge of presumption, to address you principally on\r\nthat profound and most subtle question, the nature and mode of\r\nformation of the photographic image. I am impelled to do so, not\r\nonly because the subject is full of fascination and hopefulness,\r\nbut because the wide topics of photographic methods or\r\nphotographic applications would be quite unfittingly handled by\r\nthe president you have chosen.\r\n\r\nI would first direct your attention to Sir James Dewar's\r\nremarkable result that the photographic plate retains\r\nconsiderable power of forming the latent image at temperatures\r\napproaching the absolute zero--a result which, as I submit,\r\ncompels us to regard the fundamental effects progressing in the\r\nfilm under the stimulus of light undulations as other than those\r\nof a purely chemical nature. But few, if any, instances of\r\nchemical combination or decomposition are known at so low a\r\ntemperature. Purely chemical actions cease, indeed, at far higher\r\ntemperatures, fluorine being among the few bodies which still\r\nshow\r\n\r\n[1] Presidential address to the Photographic Convention of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, July, 1905. _Nature_, Vol. 72, p. 308.\r\n\r\n202\r\n\r\nchemical activity at the comparatively elevated temperature of\r\n-180° C. In short, this result of Sir James Dewar's suggests that\r\nwe must seek for the foundations of photographic action in some\r\nphysical or intra-atomic effect which, as in the case of\r\nradioactivity or fluorescence, is not restricted to intervals of\r\ntemperature over which active molecular vis viva prevails. It\r\ncompels us to regard with doubt the role of oxidation or other\r\nchemical action as essential, but rather points to the view that\r\nsuch effects must be secondary or subsidiary. We feel, in a word,\r\nthat we must turn for guidance to some purely photo-physical\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nHere, in the first place, we naturally recall the views of Bose.\r\nThis physicist would refer the formation of the image to a strain\r\nof the bromide of silver molecule under the electric force in the\r\nlight wave, converting it into what might be regarded as an\r\nallotropic modification of the normal bromide which subsequently\r\nresponds specially to the attack of the developer. The function\r\nof the sensitiser, according to this view, is to retard the\r\nrecovery from strain. Bose obtained many suggestive parallels\r\nbetween the strain phenomena he was able to observe in silver and\r\nother substances under electromagnetic radiation and the\r\nbehaviour of the photographic plate when subjected to\r\nlong-continued exposure to light.\r\n\r\nThis theory, whatever it may have to recommend it, can hardly be\r\nregarded as offering a fundamental explanation. In the first\r\nplace, we are left in the dark as to what\r\n\r\n203\r\n\r\nthe strain may be. It may mean many and various things. We know\r\nnothing as to the inner mechanism of its effects upon subsequent\r\nchemical actions--or at least we cannot correlate it with what is\r\nknown of the physics of chemical activity. Finally, as will be\r\nseen later, it is hardly adequate to account for the varying\r\ndegrees of stability which may apparently characterise the latent\r\nimage. Still, there is much in Bose's work deserving of careful\r\nconsideration. He has by no means exhausted the line of\r\ninvestigation he has originated.\r\n\r\nAnother theory has doubtless been in the minds of many. I have\r\nsaid we must seek guidance in some photo-physical phenomenon.\r\nThere is one such which preeminently connects light and chemical\r\nphenomena through the intermediary of the effects of the former\r\nupon a component part of the atom. I refer to the phenomena of\r\nphoto-electricity.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained by Hertz and his immediate successors that\r\nlight has a remarkable power of discharging negative\r\nelectrification from the surface of bodies--especially from\r\ncertain substances. For long no explanation of the cause of this\r\nappeared. But the electron--the ubiquitous electron--is now known\r\nwith considerable certainty to be responsible. The effect of the\r\nelectric force in the light wave is to direct or assist the\r\nelectrons contained in the substance to escape from the surface\r\nof the body. Each electron carries away a very small charge of\r\nnegative electrification. If, then, a body is\r\n\r\n204\r\n\r\noriginally charged negatively, it will be gradually discharged by\r\nthis convective process. If it is not charged to start with, the\r\nelectrons will still be liberated at the surface of the body, and\r\nthis will acquire a positive charge. If the body is positively\r\ncharged at first, we cannot discharge it by illumination.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous for me to speak here of the nature of\r\nelectrons or of the various modes in which their presence may be\r\ndetected. Suffice it to say, in further connection with the Hertz\r\neffect, that when projected among gaseous molecules the electron\r\nsoon attaches itself to one of these. In other words, it ionises\r\na molecule of the gas or confers its electric charge upon it. The\r\ngaseous molecule may even be itself disrupted by impact of the\r\nelectron, if this is moving fast enough, and left bereft of an\r\nelectron.\r\n\r\nWe must note that such ionisation may be regarded as conferring\r\npotential chemical properties upon the molecules of the gas and\r\nupon the substance whence the electrons are derived. Similar\r\nionisation under electric forces enters, as we now believe, into\r\nall the chemical effects progressing in the galvanic cell, and,\r\nindeed, generally in ionised solutes.\r\n\r\nAn experiment will best illustrate the principles I wish to\r\nremind you of. A clean aluminium plate, carefully insulated by a\r\nsulphur support, is faced by a sheet of copper-wire-gauze placed\r\na couple of centimetres away from it. The gauze is maintained at\r\na high positive\r\n\r\n205\r\n\r\npotential by this dry pile. A sensitive gold-leaf electroscope is\r\nattached to the aluminium plate, and its image thrown upon the\r\nscreen. I now turn the light from this arc lamp upon the wire\r\ngauze, through which it in part passes and shines upon the\r\naluminium plate. The electroscope at once charges up rapidly.\r\nThere is a liberation of negative electrons at the surface of the\r\naluminium; these, under the attraction of the positive body, are\r\nrapidly removed as ions, and the electroscope charges up\r\npositively.\r\n\r\nAgain, if I simply electrify negatively this aluminium plate so\r\nthat the leaves of the attached electroscope diverge widely, and\r\nnow expose it to the rays from the arc lamp, the charge, as you\r\nsee, is very rapidly dissipated. With positive electrification of\r\nthe aluminium there is no effect attendant on the illumination.\r\n\r\nThus from the work of Hertz and his successors we know that\r\nlight, and more particularly what we call actinic light, is an\r\neffective means of setting free electrons from certain\r\nsubstances. In short, our photographic agent, light, has the\r\npower of expelling from certain substances the electron which is\r\nso potent a factor in most, if not in all, chemical effects. I\r\nhave not time here to refer to the work of Elster and Geitel\r\nwhereby they have shown that this action is to be traced to the\r\nelectric force in the light wave, but must turn to the probable\r\nbearing of this phenomenon on the familiar facts of photography.\r\nI assume that the experiment I have shown you is the most\r\n\r\n206\r\n\r\nfundamental photographic experiment which it is now in our power\r\nto make.\r\n\r\nWe must first ask from what substances can light liberate\r\nelectrons. There are many--metals as well as non-metals and\r\nliquids. It is a very general phenomenon and must operate widely\r\nthroughout nature. But what chiefly concerns the present\r\nconsideration is the fact that the haloid salts of silver are\r\nvigorously photo-electric, and, it is suggestive, possess,\r\naccording to Schmidt, an activity in the descending order\r\nbromide, chloride, iodide. This is, in other words, their order\r\nof activity as ionisers (under the proper conditions) when\r\nexposed to ultra-violet light. Photographers will recognise that\r\nthis is also the order of their photographic sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nAnother class of bodies also concerns our subject: the special\r\nsensitisers used by the photographer to modify the spectral\r\ndistribution of sensibility of the haloid salts, _e.g._ eosine,\r\nfuchsine, cyanine. These again are electron-producers under light\r\nstimulus. Now it has been shown by Stoletow, Hallwachs, and\r\nElster and Geitel that there is an intimate connection between\r\nphoto-electric activity and the absorption of light by the\r\nsubstance, and, indeed, that the particular wave-lengths absorbed\r\nby the substance are those which are effective in liberating the\r\nelectrons. Thus we have strong reason for believing that the\r\nvigorous photo-electric activity displayed by the special\r\nsensitisers must be dependent upon their colour absorption. You\r\nwill recognise that this is just\r\n\r\n207\r\n\r\nthe connection between their photographic effects and their\r\nbehaviour towards light.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another suggestive parallel. I referred to the\r\nobservation of Sir James Dewar as to the continued sensitiveness\r\nof the photographic film at the lowest attained extreme of\r\ntemperature, and drew the inference that the fundamental\r\nphotographic action must be of intra-atomic nature, and not\r\ndependent upon the vis viva of the molecule or atom. In then\r\nseeking the origin of photographic action in photo-electric\r\nphenomena we naturally ask, Are these latter phenomena also\r\ntraceable at low temperatures? If they are, we are entitled to\r\nlook upon this fact as a qualifying characteristic or as another\r\nlink in the chain of evidence connecting photographic with\r\nphoto-electric activity.\r\n\r\nI have quite recently, with the aid of liquid air supplied to me\r\nfrom the laboratory of the Royal Dublin Society, tested the\r\nphoto-sensibility of aluminium and also of silver bromide down to\r\ntemperatures approaching that of the liquid air. The mode of\r\nobservation is essentially that of Schmidt--what he terms his\r\nstatic method. The substance undergoing observation is, however,\r\ncontained at the bottom of a thin copper tube, 5 cm. in diameter,\r\nwhich is immersed to a depth of about 10 cm in liquid air. The\r\ntube is closed above by a paraffin stopper which carries a thin\r\nquartz window as well as the sulphur tubes through which the\r\nconnections pass. The air within is very carefully dried by\r\nphosphorus\r\n\r\n208\r\n\r\npentoxide before the experiment. The arc light is used as source\r\nof illumination. It is found that a vigorous photo-electric\r\neffect continues in the case of the clean aluminium. In the case\r\nof the silver bromide a distinct photo-electric effect is still\r\nobserved. I have not had leisure to make, as yet, any trustworthy\r\nestimate of the percentage effect at this temperature in the case\r\nof either substance. Nor have I determined the temperature\r\naccurately. The latter may be taken as roughly about -150° C,\r\n\r\nSir James Dewar's actual measilrements afforded twenty per cent.\r\nof the normal photographic effect at -180° C. and ten per cent.\r\nat the temperature of -252.5° C.\r\n\r\nWith this much to go upon, and the important additional fact that\r\nthe electronic discharge--as from the X-ray tube or from\r\nradium--generates the latent image, I think we are fully entitled\r\nto suggest, as a legitimate lead to experiment, the hypothesis\r\nthat the beginnings of photographic action involve an electronic\r\ndischarge from the light-sensitive molecule; in other words that\r\nthe latent image is built up of ionised atoms or molecules the\r\nresult of the photo-electric effect on the illuminated silver\r\nhaloid, and it is upon these ionised atoms that the chemical\r\neffects of the developer are subsequently directed. It may be\r\nthat the liberated electrons ionise molecules not directly\r\naffected, or it may be that in their liberation they disrupt\r\ncomplex molecules built up in the ripening of the\r\n\r\n209\r\n\r\nemulsion. With the amount we have to go upon we cannot venture to\r\nparticularise. It will be said that such an action must be in\r\npart of the nature of a chemical effect. This must be admitted,\r\nand, in so far as the rearrangement of molecular fabrics is\r\ninvolved, the result will doubtless be controlled by temperature\r\nconditions. The facts observed by Sir James Dewar support this.\r\nBut there is involved a fundamental process--the liberation of the\r\nelectron by the electric force in the light wave, which is a\r\nphysical effect, and which, upon the hypothesis of its reality as\r\na factor in forming the latent image, appears to explain\r\ncompletely the outstanding photographic sensitiveness of the film\r\nat temperatures far below those at which chemical actions in\r\ngeneral cease.\r\n\r\nAgain, we may assume that the electron--producing power of the\r\nspecial sensitiser or dye for the particular ray it absorbs is\r\nresponsible, or responsible in part, for the special\r\nsensitiveness it confers upon the film. Sir Wm. Abney has shown\r\nthat these sensitisers are active even if laid on as a varnish on\r\nthe sensitive surface and removed before development. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that at temperatures of about -50° these\r\nsensitisers lose much of their influence on the film; as I have\r\npointed out in a paper read before the Photographic Convention of\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nIt. appears to me that on these views the curious phenomenon of\r\nrecurrent reversals does not present a problem hopeless of\r\nexplanation. The process of photo-\r\n\r\n210\r\n\r\nionisation constituting the latent image, where the ion is\r\nprobably not immediately neutralised by chemical combination,\r\npresents features akin to the charging of a capacity--say a Leyden\r\njar. There may be a rising potential between the groups of ions\r\nuntil ultimately a point is attained when there is a spontaneous\r\nneutralisation. I may observe that the phenomena of reversal\r\nappear to indicate that the change in the silver bromide\r\nmolecule, whatever be its nature, is one of gradually increasing\r\nintensity, and finally attains a maximum when a return to the\r\noriginal condition occurs. The maximum is the point of most\r\nintense developable image. It is probable that the sensitiser--in\r\nthis case the gelatin in which the bromide of silver is\r\nimmersed--plays a part in the conditions of stability which are\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nOf great interest in all our considerations and theories is the\r\nrecent work of Wood on photographic reversal. The result of this\r\nwork is--as I take it--to show that the stability of the latent\r\nimage may be very various according to the mode of its formation.\r\nThus it appears that the sort of latent effect which is produced\r\nby pressure or friction is the least stable of any. This may be\r\nreversed or wiped out by the application of any other known form\r\nof photographic stimulus. Thus an exposure to X-rays will\r\nobliterate it, or a very brief exposure to light. The latent\r\nimage arising from X-rays is next in order of increasing\r\nstability. Light action will remove this. Third in order is a\r\nvery brief light-shock or sudden flash. This\r\n\r\n211\r\n\r\ncannot be reversed by any of the foregoing modes of stimulation,\r\nbut a long-continued undulatory stimulus, as from lamp-light,\r\nwill reverse it. Last and most stable of all is the gradually\r\nbuilt-up configuration due to long-continued light exposure. This\r\ncan only be reversed by overdoing it according to the known facts\r\nof recurrent reversal. Wood takes occasion to remark that these\r\nphenomena are in bad agreement with the strain theory of Bose. We\r\nhave, in fact, but the one resource--the allotropic modification\r\nof the haloid--whereby to explain all these orders of stability.\r\nIt appears to me that the elasticity of the electronic theory is\r\ngreater. The state of the ionised system may be very various\r\naccording as it arises from continued rhythmic effects or from\r\nunorganised shocks. The ionisation due to X-rays or to friction\r\nwill probably be quite unorganised, that due to light more or\r\nless stable according to the gradual and gentle nature of the\r\nforces at work. I think we are entitled to conclude that on the\r\nwhole there is nothing in Wood's beautiful experiments opposed to\r\nthe photo-electric origin of photographic effects, but that they\r\nrather fall in with what might be anticipated according to that\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nWhen we look for further support to the views I have laid before\r\nyou we are confronted with many difficulties. I have not as yet\r\ndetected any electronic discharge from the film under light\r\nstimulus. This may be due to my defective experiments, or to a\r\nfact noted by Elster and Geitel concerning the photo-electric\r\nproperties of gelatin.\r\n\r\n212\r\n\r\nThey obtained a vigorous effect from Balmain's luminous paint,\r\nbut when this was mixed in gelatin there was no external effect.\r\nSchmidt's results as to the continuance of photo-electric\r\nactivity when bodies in general are dissolved in each other lead\r\nus to believe that an actual conservative property of the medium\r\nand not an effect of this on the luminous paint is here involved.\r\nThis conservative effect of the gelatin may be concerned with its\r\nefficacy as a sensitiser.\r\n\r\nIn the views I have laid before you I have endeavoured to show\r\nthat the recent addition to our knowledge of the electron as an\r\nentity taking part in many physical and chemical effects should\r\nbe kept in sight in seeking an explanation of the mode of origin\r\nof the latent image.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] For a more detailed account of the subject, and some\r\ningenious extensions of the views expressed above, see\r\n_Photo-Electricity_, by H. Stanley Allen: Longmans, Green & Ca.,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\n213\r\n\r\nPLEOCHROIC HALOES [1]\r\n\r\nIT is now well established that a helium atom is expelled from\r\ncertain of the radioactive elements at the moment of\r\ntransformation. The helium atom or alpha ray leaves the\r\ntransforming atom with a velocity which varies in the different\r\nradioactive elements, but which is always very great, attaining\r\nas much as 2 x 109 cms. per second; a velocity which, if\r\nunchecked, would carry the atom round the earth in less than two\r\nseconds. The alpha ray carries a positive charge of double the\r\nionic amount.\r\n\r\nWhen an alpha ray is discharged from the transforming element\r\ninto a gaseous medium its velocity is rapidly checked and its\r\nenergy absorbed. A certain amount of energy is thus transferred\r\nfrom the transforming atom to the gas. We recognise this energy\r\nin the gas by the altered properties of the latter; chiefly by\r\nthe fact that it becomes a conductor of electricity. The\r\nmechanism by which this change is effected is in part known. The\r\natoms of the gas, which appear to be freely penetrated by the\r\nalpha ray, are so far dismembered as to yield charged electrons\r\nor ions; the atoms remaining charged with an equal and opposite\r\ncharge. Such a medium of\r\n\r\n[1] Being the Huxley Lecture, delivered at the University of\r\nBirmingham on October 30th, 1912. Bedrock, Jan., 1913.\r\n\r\n214\r\n\r\nfree electric charges becomes a conductor of electricity by\r\nconvection when an electromotive force is applied. The gas also\r\nacquires other properties in virtue of its ionisation. Under\r\ncertain conditions it may acquire chemical activity and new\r\ncombinations may be formed or existing ones broken up. When its\r\ninitial velocity is expended the helium atom gives up its\r\nproperties as an alpha ray and thenceforth remains possessed of\r\nthe ordinary varying velocity of thermal agitation. Bragg and\r\nKleeman and others have investigated the career of the alpha ray\r\nwhen its path or range lies in a gas at ordinary or obtainable\r\nconditions of pressure and temperature. We will review some of\r\nthe facts ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe range or distance traversed in a gas at ordinary pressures is\r\na few centimetres. The following table, compiled by Geiger, gives\r\nthe range in air at the temperature of 15° C.:\r\n\r\n               cms.                   cms.                   cms.\r\nUranium 1 -   2.50    Thorium -     2.72     Radioactinium  4.60\r\nUranium 2 -   2.90    Radiothorium  3.87     Actinium X -   4.40\r\nIonium -      3.00    Thorium X -   4.30     Act Emanation  5.70\r\nRadium -      3.30    Th Emanation  5.00     Actinium A -   6.50\r\nRa Emanation  4.16    Thorium A -   5.70     Actinium C -   5.40\r\nRadium A -    4.75    Thorium C1 -  4.80\r\nRadium C -    6.94    Thorium C2 -  8.60\r\nRadium F -    3.77\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the ray of greatest range is that proceeding\r\nfrom thorium C2, which reaches a distance of 8.6 cms. In the\r\nuranium family the fastest ray is\r\n\r\n215\r\n\r\nthat of radium C. It attains 6.94 cms. There is thus an\r\nappreciable difference between the ultimate distances traversed\r\nby the most energetic rays of the two families. The shortest\r\nranges are those of uranium 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nThe ionisation effected by these rays is by no means uniform\r\nalong the path of the ray. By examining the conductivity of the\r\ngas at different points along the path of the ray, the ionisation\r\nat these points may be determined. At the limits of the range the\r\nionisation\r\n\r\n{Fig. 13}\r\n\r\nceases. In this manner the range is, in fact, determined. The\r\ndotted curve (Fig. 13) depicts the recent investigation of the\r\nionisation effected by a sheaf of parallel rays of radium C in\r\nair, as determined by Geiger. The range is laid out horizontally\r\nin centimetres. The numbers of ions are laid out vertically. The\r\nremarkable nature of the results will be at once apparent. We\r\nshould have expected that the ray at the beginning of its path,\r\nwhen its velocity and kinetic energy were greatest, would have\r\nbeen more effective than towards the end of its range\r\n\r\n216\r\n\r\nwhen its energy had almost run out. But the curve shows that it\r\nis just the other way. The lagging ray, about to resign its\r\nionising properties, becomes a much more efficient ioniser than\r\nit was at first. The maximum efficiency is, however, in the case\r\nof a bundle of parallel rays, not quite at the end of the range,\r\nbut about half a centimetre from it. The increase to the maximum\r\nis rapid, the fall from the maximum to nothing is much more\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nIt can be shown that the ionisation effected anywhere along the\r\npath of the ray is inversely proportional to the velocity of the\r\nray at that point. But this evidently does not apply to the last\r\n5 or 10 mms. of the range where the rate of ionisation and of the\r\nspeed of the ray change most rapidly. To what are the changing\r\nproperties of the rays near the end of their path to be ascribed?\r\nIt is only recently that this matter has been elucidated.\r\n\r\nWhen the alpha ray has sufficiently slowed down, its power of\r\npassing right through atoms, without appreciably experiencing any\r\neffects from them, diminishes. The opposing atoms begin to exert\r\nan influence on the path of the ray, deflecting it a little. The\r\nheavier atoms will deflect it most. This effect has been very\r\nsuccessfully investigated by Geiger. It is known as \"scattering.\"\r\nThe angle of scattering increases rapidly with the decrease of\r\nvelocity. Now the effect of the scattering will be to cause some\r\nof the rays to complete their ranges\r\n\r\n217\r\n\r\nor, more accurately, to leave their direct line of advance a\r\nlittle sooner than others. In the beautiful experiments of C. T.\r\nR. Wilson we are enabled to obtain ocular demonstration of the\r\nscattering. The photograph (Fig. 14.), which I owe to the\r\nkindness of Mr. Wilson, shows the deflection of the ray towards\r\nthe end of its path. In\r\n\r\n{Fig. 14}\r\n\r\nthis case the path of the ray has been rendered visible by the\r\ncondensation of water particles under the influence of the\r\nionisation; the atmosphere in which the ray travels being in a\r\nstate of supersaturation with water vapour at the instant of the\r\npassage of the ray. It is evident that if we were observing the\r\nionisation along a sheaf of parallel rays, all starting with\r\nequal velocity,\r\n\r\n218\r\n\r\nthe effect of the bending of some of the rays near the end of\r\ntheir range must be to cause a decrease in the aggregate\r\nionisation near the very end of the ultimate range. For, in fact,\r\nsome of the rays complete their work of ionising at points in the\r\ngas before the end is reached. This is the cause, or at least an\r\nimportant contributory cause, of the decline in the ionisation\r\nnear the end of the range, when the effects of a bundle of rays\r\nare being observed. The explanation does not suggest that the\r\nionising power of any one ray is actually diminished before it\r\nfinally ceases to be an alpha ray.\r\n\r\nThe full line in Fig. 13 gives the ionisation curve which it may\r\nbe expected would be struck out by a single alpha ray. In it the\r\nionisation goes on increasing till it abruptly ceases altogether,\r\nwith the entire loss of the initial kinetic energy of the\r\nparticle.\r\n\r\nA highly remarkable fact was found out by Bragg. The effect of\r\nthe atom traversed by the ray in checking the velocity of the ray\r\nis independent of the physical and chemical condition of the\r\natom. He measured the \"stopping power\" of a medium by the\r\ndistance the ray can penetrate into it compared with the distance\r\nto which it can penetrate in air. The less the ratio the greater\r\nis the stopping power. The stopping power of a substance is\r\nproportional to the square root of its atomic weight. The\r\nstopping power of an atom is not altered if it is in chemical\r\nunion with another atom. The atomic weight is the one quality of\r\nimportance. The physical\r\n\r\n219\r\n\r\nstate, whether the element is in the solid, liquid or gaseous\r\nstate, is unimportant. And when we deal with molecules the\r\nstopping power is simply proportional to the sum of the square\r\nroots of the atomic weights of the atoms entering into the\r\nmolecule. This is the \"additive law,\" and it obviously enables us\r\nto calculate what the range in any substance of known chemical\r\ncomposition and density will be, compared with the range in air.\r\n\r\nThis is of special importance in connection with phenomena we\r\nhave presently to consider. It means that, knowing the chemical\r\ncomposition and density of any medium whatsoever, solid, liquid\r\nor gaseous, we can calculate accurately the distance to which any\r\nparticular alpha ray will penetrate. Nor have the temperature and\r\npressure to which the medium is subjected any influence save in\r\nso far as they may affect the proximity of one atom to another.\r\nThe retardation of the alpha ray in the atom is not affected.\r\n\r\nThis valuable additive law, however, cannot be applied in\r\nstrictness to the amount of ionisation attending the ray. The\r\nform of the molecule, or more generally its volume, may have an\r\ninfluence upon this. Bragg draws the conclusion, from this fact\r\nas well as from the notable increase of ionisation with loss of\r\nspeed, that the ionisation is dependent upon the time the ray\r\nspends in the molecule. The energy of the ray is, indeed, found\r\nto be less efficient in producing ionisation in the smaller\r\natomm.\r\n\r\n220\r\n\r\nBefore leaving our review of the general laws governing the\r\npassage of alpha rays through matter, another point of interest\r\nmust be referred to. We have hitherto spoken in general terms of\r\nthe fact that ionisation attends the passage of the ray. We have\r\nsaid nothing as to the nature of the ionisation so produced. But\r\nin point of fact the ionisation due to an alpha ray is sui\r\ngeneris. A glance at one of Wilson's photographs (Fig. 14.)\r\nillustrates this. The white streak of water particles marks the\r\npath of the ray. The ions produced are evidently closely crowded\r\nalong the track of the ray. They have been called into existence\r\nin a very minute instant of time. Now we know that ions of\r\nopposite sign if left to themselves recombine. The rate of\r\nrecombination depends upon the product of the number of each sign\r\npresent in unit volume. Here the numbers are very great and the\r\nvolume very small. The ionic density is therefore high, and\r\nrecombination very rapidly removes the ions after they are\r\nformed. We see here a peculiarity of the ionisation effected by\r\nalpha rays. It is linear in distribution and very local. Much of\r\nthe ionisation in gases is again undone by recombination before\r\ndiffusion leads to the separation of the ions. This \"initial\r\nrecombination\" is greatest towards the end of the path of the ray\r\nwhere the ionisation is a maximum. Here it may be so effective\r\nthat the form of the curve is completely lost unless a very large\r\nelectromotive force is used to separate the ions when the\r\nionisation is being investigated.\r\n\r\n221\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed recent work at sufficient length to\r\nunderstand something of the nature of the most important advance\r\never made in our knowledge of the atom. Let us glance briefly at\r\nwhat we have learned. The radioactive atom in sinking to a lower\r\natomic weight casts out with enormous velocity an atom of helium.\r\nIt thus loses a definite portion of its mass and of its energy.\r\nHelium which is chemically one of the most inert of the elements,\r\nis, when possessed of such great kinetic energy, able to\r\npenetrate and ionise the atoms which it meets in its path. It\r\nspends its energy in the act of ionising them, coming to rest,\r\nwhen it moves in air, in a few centimetres. Its initial velocity\r\ndepends upon the particular radioactive element which has given\r\nrise to it. The length of its path is therefore different\r\naccording to the radioactive element from which it proceeds. The\r\nretardation which it experiences in its path depends entirely\r\nupon the atomic weight of the atoms which it traverses. As it\r\nadvances in its path its effectiveness in ionising the atom\r\nrapidly increases and attains a very marked maximum. In a gas the\r\nions produced being much crowded together recombine rapidly; so\r\nrapidly that the actual ionisation may be quite concealed unless\r\na sufficiently strong electric force is applied to separate them.\r\nSuch is a brief summary of the climax of radioactive\r\ndiscovery:--the birth, life and death of the alpha ray. Its advent\r\ninto Science has altered fundamentally our conception of\r\n\r\n222\r\n\r\nmatter. It is fraught with momentous bearings upon Geological\r\nScience. How the work of the alpha ray is sometimes recorded\r\nvisibly in the rocks and what we may learn from that record, I\r\npropose now to bring before you.\r\n\r\nIn certain minerals, notably the brown variety of mica known as\r\nbiotite, the microscope reveals minute circular marks occurring\r\nhere and there, quite irregularly. The most usual appearance is\r\nthat of a circular area darker in colour than the surrounding\r\nmineral. The radii of these little disc-shaped marks when well\r\ndefined are found to be remarkably uniform, in some cases four\r\nhundredths of a millimetre and in others three hundredths, about.\r\nThese are the measurements in biotite. In other minerals the\r\nmeasurements are not quite the same as in biotite. Such minute\r\nobjects are quite invisible to the naked eye. In some rocks they\r\nare very abundant, indeed they may be crowded together in such\r\nnumbers as to darken the colour of the mineral containing them.\r\nThey have long been a mystery to petrologists.\r\n\r\nClose examination shows that there is always a small speck of a\r\nforeign body at the centre of the circle, and it is often\r\npossible to identify the nature of this central substance, small\r\nthough it be. Most generally it is found to be the mineral\r\nzircon. Now this mineral was shown by Strutt to contain radium in\r\nquantities much exceeding those found in ordinary rock\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n223\r\n\r\nSome other mineral may occasionally form the nucleus, but we\r\nnever find any which is not known to be specially likely to\r\ncontain a radioactive substance. Another circumstance we notice.\r\nThe smaller this central nucleus the more perfect in form is the\r\ndarkened circular area surrounding it. When the circle is very\r\nperfect and the central mineral clearly defined at its centre we\r\nfind by measurement that the radius of the darkened area is\r\ngenerally 0.033 mm. It may sometimes be 0.040 mm. These are\r\nalways the measurements in biotite. In other minerals the radii\r\nare a little different.\r\n\r\nWe see in the photograph (Pl. XXIII, lower figure), much\r\nmagnified, a halo contained in biotite. We are looking at a\r\nregion in a rock-section, the rock being ground down to such a\r\nthickness that light freely passes through it. The biotite is in\r\nthe centre of the field. Quartz and felspar surround it. The rock\r\nis a granite. The biotite is not all one crystal. Two crystals,\r\nmutually inclined, are cut across. The halo extends across both\r\ncrystals, but owing to the fact that polarised light is used in\r\ntaking the photograph it appears darker in one crystal than in\r\nthe other. We see the zircon which composes the nucleus. The fine\r\nstriated appearance of the biotite is due to the cleavage of that\r\nmineral, which is cut across in the section.\r\n\r\nThe question arises whether the darkened area surrounding the\r\nzircon may not be due to the influence of the radioactive\r\nsubstances contained in the zircon. The\r\n\r\n224\r\n\r\nextraordinary uniformity of the radial measurements of perfectly\r\nformed haloes (to use the name by which they have long been\r\nknown) suggests that they may be the result of alpha radiation.\r\nFor in that case, as we have seen, we can at once account for the\r\ndefinite radius as simply representing the range of the ray in\r\nbiotite. The furthest-reaching ray will define the radius of the\r\nhalo. In the case of the uranium family this will be radium C,\r\nand in the case of thorium it will be thorium C. Now here we\r\npossess a means of at once confirming or rejecting the view that\r\nthe halo is a radioactive phenomenon and occasioned by alpha\r\nradiation; for we can calculate what the range of these rays will\r\nbe in biotite, availing ourselves of Bragg's additive law,\r\nalready referred to. When we make this calculation we find that\r\nradium C just penetrates 0.033 mm. and thorium C 0.040 mm. The\r\nproof is complete that we are dealing with the effects of alpha\r\nrays. Observe now that not only is the coincidence of measurement\r\nand calculation a proof of the view that alpha radiation has\r\noccasioned the halo, but it is a very complete verification of\r\nthe important fact stated by Bragg, that the stopping power\r\ndepends solely on the atomic weight of the atoms traversed by the\r\nray.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that our examination of the rocks reveals only the\r\ntwo sorts of halo: the radium halo and the thorium halo. This is\r\nnot without teaching. For why not find an actinium halo? Now\r\nRutherford long ago suggested that this element and its\r\nderivatives were\r\n\r\n225\r\n\r\nprobably an offspring of the uranium family; a side branch, as it\r\nwere, in the formation of which relatively few transforming atoms\r\ntook part. On Rutherford's theory then, actinium should always\r\naccompany uranium and radium, but in very subordinate amount. The\r\nabsence of actinium haloes clearly supports this view. For if\r\nactinium was an independent element we would be sure to find\r\nactinium haloes. The difference in radius should be noticeable.\r\nIf, on the other hand, actinium\r\n\r\nwas always associated with uranium and radium, then its effects\r\nwould be submerged in those of the much more potent effects of\r\nthe uranium series of elements.\r\n\r\nIt will have occurred to you already that if the radioactive\r\norigin of the halo is assured the shape of a halo is not really\r\ncircular, but spherical. This is so. There is no such thing as a\r\ndisc-shaped halo. The halo is a spherical volume containing the\r\nradioactive nucleus at its centre. The true radius of the halo\r\nmay, therefore, only be measured on sections passing through the\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\n226\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the mode of formation of a halo we may\r\nprofitably study on a diagram the events which go on within the\r\nhalo-sphere. Such a diagram is seen in Fig. 15. It shows to\r\nrelatively correct scale the limiting range of all the alpha-ray\r\nproducing members of the uranium and thorium families. We know\r\nthat each member of a family will exist in equilibrium amount\r\nwithin the nucleus possessing the parent element. Each alpha ray\r\nleaving the nucleus will just attain its range and then cease to\r\naffect the mica. Within the halosphere, there must be, therefore,\r\nthe accumulated effects of the influences of all the rays. Each\r\nhas its own sphere of influence, and the spheres are all\r\nconcentric.\r\n\r\nThe radii in biotite of the several spheres are given in the\r\nfollowing table\r\n\r\nURANIUM FAMILY.\r\nRadium C -       0.0330 mm.\r\nRadium A -       0.0224 mm.\r\nRa Emanation -   0.0196 mm.\r\nRadium F -       0.0177 mm.\r\nRadium -         0.0156 mm.\r\nIonium -         0.0141 mm.\r\nUranium 1 -      0.0137 mm.\r\nUranium 2 -      0.0118 mm.\r\n\r\nTHORIUM FAMILY.\r\nThorium CE -     0.040 mm.\r\nThorium A -      0.026 mm.\r\nTh Emanation -   0.023 mm.\r\nThorium Ci -     0.022 mm.\r\nThorium X -      0.020 mm.\r\nRadiothorium -   0.119 mm.\r\nThorium -        0.013 mm.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph (Pl. XXIV, lower figure), we see a uranium and\r\na thorium halo in the same crystal of mica. The mica is contained\r\nin a rock-section and is cut across the cleavage. The effects of\r\nthorium Ca are clearly shown\r\n\r\n227\r\n\r\nas a lighter border surrounding the accumulated inner darkening\r\ndue to the other thorium rays. The uranium halo (to the right)\r\nsimilarly shows the effects of radium C, but less distinctly.\r\n\r\nHaloes which are uniformly dark all over as described above are,\r\nin point of fact, \"over-exposed\"; to borrow a familiar\r\nphotographic term. Haloes are found which show much beautiful\r\ninternal detail. Too vigorous action obscures this detail just as\r\ndetail is lost in an over-exposed photograph. We may again have\r\n\"under-exposed\" haloes in which the action of the several rays is\r\nincomplete or in which the action of certain of the rays has left\r\nlittle if any trace. Beginning at the most under-exposed haloes\r\nwe find circular dark marks having the radius 0.012 or 0.013 mm.\r\nThese haloes are due to uranium, although their inner darkening\r\nis doubtless aided by the passage of rays which were too few to\r\nextend the darkening beyond the vigorous effects of the two\r\nuranium rays. Then we find haloes carried out to the radii 0.016,\r\n0.018 and 0.019 mm. The last sometimes show very beautiful outer\r\nrings having radial dimensions such as would be produced by\r\nradium A and radium C. Finally we may have haloes in which\r\ninterior detail is lost so far out as the radius due to emanation\r\nor radium A, while outside this floats the ring due to radium C.\r\nCertain variations of these effects may occur, marking,\r\napparently, different stages of exposure. Plates XXIII and XXIV\r\n(upper figure) illustrate some of these stages;\r\n\r\n228\r\n\r\nthe latter photograph being greatly enlarged to show clearly the\r\nhalo-sphere of radium A.\r\n\r\nIn most of the cases mentioned above the structure evidently\r\nshows the existence of concentric spherical shells of darkened\r\nbiotite. This is a very interesting fact. For it proves that in\r\nthe mineral the alpha ray gives rise to the same increased\r\nionisation towards the end of its range, as Bragg determined in\r\nthe case of gases. And we must conclude that the halo in every\r\ncase grows in this manner. A spherical shell of darkened biotite\r\nis first produced and the inner colouration is only effected as\r\nthe more feeble ionisation along the track of the ray in course\r\nof ages gives rise to sufficient alteration of the mineral. This\r\nmore feeble ionisation is, near the nucleus, enhanced in its\r\neffects by the fact that there all the rays combine to increase\r\nthe ionisation and, moreover, the several tracks are there\r\ncrowded by the convergency to the centre. Hence the most\r\nelementary haloes seldom show definite rings due to uranium,\r\netc., but appear as embryonic disc-like markings. The photographs\r\nillustrate many of the phases of halo development.\r\n\r\nRutherford succeeded in making a halo artificially by compressing\r\ninto a capillary glass tube a quantity of the emanation of\r\nradium. As the emanation decayed the various derived products\r\ncame into existence and all the several alpha rays penetrated the\r\nglass, darkening the walls of the capillary out to the limit of\r\nthe range of radium C in glass. Plate XXV shows a magnified\r\nsection of the\r\n\r\n229\r\n\r\ntube. The dark central part is the capillary. The tubular halo\r\nsurrounds it. This experiment has, however, been anticipated by\r\nsome scores of millions of years, for here is the same effect in\r\na biotite crystal (Pl. XXV). Along what are apparently tubular\r\npassages or cracks in the mica, a solution, rich in radioactive\r\nsubstances, has moved; probably during the final consolidation of\r\nthe granite in which the mica occurs. A continuous and very\r\nregular halo has developed along these conduits. A string of\r\nhalo-spheres may lie along such passages. We must infer that\r\nsolutions or gases able to establish the radioactive nuclei moved\r\nalong these conduits, and we are entitled to ask if all the\r\nhaloes in this biotite are not, in this sense, of secondary\r\norigin. There is, I may add, much to support such a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe widespread distribution of radioactive substances is most\r\nreadily appreciated by examination of sections of rocks cut thin\r\nenough for microscopic investigation. It is, indeed, difficult to\r\nfind, in the older rocks of granitic type, mica which does not\r\nshow haloes, or traces of haloes. Often we find that every one of\r\nthe inclusions in the mica--that is, every one of the earlier\r\nformed substances--contain radioactive elements, as indicated by\r\nthe presence of darkened borders. As will be seen presently the\r\nquantities involved are generally vanishingly small. For example\r\nit was found by direct determination that in one gram of the\r\nhalo-rich mica of Co. Carlow there was rather less than twelve\r\nbillionths of a gram of radium, We are\r\n\r\n230\r\n\r\nentitled to infer that other rare elements are similarly widely\r\ndistributed but remain undetectable because of their more stable\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that the under-exposed halo is a recent\r\ncreation. By no means. All are old, appallingly old; and in the\r\nsame rock all are, probably, of the same, or neatly the same,\r\nage. The under-exposure is simply due to a lesser quantity of the\r\nradioactive elements in the nucleus. They are under-exposed, in\r\nshort, not because of lesser duration of exposure, but because of\r\ninsufficient action; as when in taking a photograph the stop is\r\nnot open enough for the time of the exposure.\r\n\r\nThe halo has, so far, told us that the additive law is obeyed in\r\nsolid media, and that the increased ionisation attending the\r\nslowing down of the ray obtaining in gases, also obtains in\r\nsolids; for, otherwise, the halo would not commence its\r\ndevelopment as a spherical shell or envelope. But here we learn\r\nthat there is probably a certain difference in the course of\r\nevents attending the immediate passage of the ray in the gas and\r\nin the solid. In the former, initial recombination may obscure\r\nthe intense ionisation near the end of the range. We can only\r\ndetect the true end-effects by artificially separating the ions\r\nby a strong electric force. If this recombination happened in the\r\nmineral we should not have the concentric spheres so well defined\r\nas we see them to be. What, then, hinders the initial\r\nrecombination in the solid? The answer probably is that the newly\r\nformed\r\n\r\n231\r\n\r\nion is instantly used up in a fresh chemical combination. Nor is\r\nit free to change its place as in the gas. There is simply a new\r\nequilibrium brought about by its sudden production. In this\r\nmanner the conditions in the complex molecule of biotite,\r\ntourmaline, etc., may be quite as effective in preventing initial\r\nrecombination as the most effective electric force we could\r\napply. The final result is that we find the Bragg curve\r\nreproduced most accurately in the delicate shading of the rings\r\nmaking up the perfectly exposed halo.\r\n\r\nThat the shading of the rings reproduces the form of the Bragg\r\ncurve, projected, as it were, upon the line of advance of the ray\r\nand reproduced in depth of shading, shows that in yet another\r\nparticular the alpha ray behaves much the same in the solid as in\r\nthe gas. A careful examination of the outer edge of the circles\r\nalways reveals a steep but not abrupt cessation of the action of\r\nthe ray. Now Geiger has investigated and proved the existence of\r\nscattering of the alpha ray by solids. We may, therefore, suppose\r\nwith much probability that there is the same scattering within\r\nthe mineral near the end of the range. The heavy iron atom of the\r\nbiotite is, doubtless, chiefly responsible for this in biotite\r\nhaloes. I may observe that this shading of the outer bounding\r\nsurface of the sphere of action is found however minute the\r\ncentral nucleus. In the case of a nucleus of considerable size\r\nanother effect comes in which tends to produce an enhanced\r\nshading. This will\r\n\r\n232\r\n\r\nresult if rays proceed from different depths in the nucleus. If\r\nthe nucleus were of the same density and atomic weight as the\r\nsurrounding mica, there would be little effect. But its density\r\nand molecular weight are generally greater, hence the retardation\r\nis greater, and rays proceeding from deep in the nucleus\r\nexperience more retardation than those which proceed from points\r\nnear to the surface. The distances reached by the rays in the\r\nmica will vary accordingly, and so there will be a gradual\r\ncessation of the effects of the rays.\r\n\r\nThe result of our study of the halo may be summed up in the\r\nstatement that in nearly every particular we have the phenomena,\r\nwhich have been measured and observed in the gas, reproduced on a\r\nminute scale in the halo. Initial recombination seems, however,\r\nto be absent or diminished in effectiveness; probably because of\r\nthe new stability instantly assumed by the ionised atoms.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting points about the halo remains to be\r\nreferred to. The halo is always uniformly darkened all round its\r\ncircumference and is perfectly spherical. Sections, whether taken\r\nin the plane of cleavage of the mica or across it, show the same\r\nexactly circular form, and the same radius. Of course, if there\r\nwas any appreciable increase of range along or across the\r\ncleavage the form of the halo on the section across the cleavage\r\nshould be elliptical. The fact that there is no measurable\r\nellipticity is, I think, one which on first consideration would\r\nnot be expected.\r\n\r\n233\r\n\r\nFor what are the conditions attending the passage of the ray in a\r\nmedium such as mica? According to crystallographic conceptions we\r\nhave here an orderly arrangement of molecules, the units\r\ncomposing the crystal being alike in mass, geometrically spaced,\r\nand polarised as regards the attractions they exert one upon\r\nanother. Mica, more especially, has the cleavage phenomenon\r\ndeveloped to a degree which transcends its development in any\r\nother known substance. We can cleave it and again cleave it till\r\nits flakes float in the air, and we may yet go on cleaving it by\r\nspecial means till the flakes no longer reflect visible light.\r\nAnd not less remarkable is the uniplanar nature of its cleavage.\r\nThere is little cleavage in any plane but the one, although it is\r\neasy to show that the molecules in the plane of the flake are in\r\norderly arrangement and are more easily parted in some directions\r\nthan in others. In such a medium beyond all others we must look\r\nwith surprise upon the perfect sphere struck out by the alpha\r\nrays, because it seems certain that the cleavage is due to lesser\r\nattraction, and, probably, further spacing of the molecules, in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the cleavage.\r\n\r\nIt may turn out that the spacing of the molecules will influence\r\nbut little the average number per unit distance encountered by\r\nrays moving in divergent paths. If this is so, we seem left to\r\nconclude that, in spite of its unequal and polarised attractions,\r\nthere is equal retardation and equal ionisation in the molecule\r\nin whatever\r\n\r\n234\r\n\r\ndirection it is approached. Or, again, if the encounters indeed\r\ndiffer in number, then some compensating effect must exist\r\nwhereby a direction of lesser linear density involves greater\r\nstopping power in the molecule encountered, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the change produced by the alpha rays is unknown.\r\nBut the formation of the halo is not, at least in its earlier\r\nstages, attended by destruction of the crystallographic and\r\noptical properties of the medium. The optical properties are\r\nunaltered in nature but are increased in intensity. This applies\r\ntill the halo has become so darkened that light is no longer\r\ntransmitted under the conditions of thickness obtaining in rock\r\nsections. It is well known that there is in biotite a maximum\r\nabsorption of a plane-polarised light ray, when the plane of\r\nvibration coincides with the plane of cleavage. A section across\r\nthe cleavage then shows a maximum amount of absorption. A halo\r\nseen on this section simply produces this effect in a more\r\nintense degree. This is well shown in Plate XXIII (lower figure),\r\non a portion of the halo-sphere. The descriptive name \"Pleochroic\r\nHalo\" has originated from this fact. We must conclude that the\r\neffect of the ionisation due to the alpha ray has not been to\r\nalter fundamentally the conditions which give rise to the optical\r\nproperties of the medium. The increased absorption is probably\r\nassociated with some change in the chemical state of the iron\r\npresent. Haloes are, I believe, not found in minerals from which\r\nthis\r\n\r\n235\r\n\r\nelement is absent. One thing is quite certain. The colouration is\r\nnot due to an accumulation of helium atoms, _i.e._ of spent alpha\r\nrays. The evidence for this is conclusive. If helium was\r\nresponsible we should have haloes produced in all sorts of\r\ncolourless minerals. Now we sometimes see zircons in felspars and\r\nin quartz, etc., but in no such case is a halo produced. And\r\nhalo-spheres formed within and sufficiently close to the edge of\r\na crystal of mica are abruptly truncated by neighbouring areas of\r\nfclspar or quartz, although we know that the rays must pass\r\nfreely across the boundary. Again it is easy to show that even in\r\nthe oldest haloes the quantity of helium involved is so small\r\nthat one might say the halo-sphere was a tolerably good vacuum as\r\nregards helium. There is, finally, no reason to suppose that the\r\nimprisoned helium would exhibit such a colouration, or, indeed,\r\nany at all.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the great age of the halo. Haloes are\r\nnot found in the younger igneous rocks. It is probable that a\r\nhalo less than a million years old has never been seen. This,\r\nprimâ facie, indicates an extremely slow rate of formation. And\r\nour calculations quite support the conclusions that the growth of\r\na halo, if this has been uniform, proceeds at a rate of almost\r\nunimaginable slowness.\r\n\r\nLet us calculate the number of alpha rays which may have gone to\r\nform a halo in the Devonian granite of Leinster.\r\n\r\n236\r\n\r\nIt is common to find haloes developed perfectly in this granite,\r\nand having a nucleus of zircon less than 5 x 10-4 cms. in\r\ndiameter. The volume of zircon is 65 x 10-12 c.cs. and the mass\r\n3 x 10-10 grm.; and if there was in this zircon 10-8 grm. radium\r\nper gram (a quantity about five times the greatest amount\r\nmeasured by Strutt), the mass of radium involved is 3 x 10-18\r\ngrm. From this and from the fact ascertained by Rutherford that\r\nthe number of alpha rays expelled by a gram of radium in one\r\nsecond is 3.4 x 1010, we find that three rays are shot from the\r\nnucleus in a year. If, now, geological time since the Devonian is\r\n50 millions of years, then 150 millions of rays built up the\r\nhalo. If geological time since the Devonian is 400 millions of\r\nyears, then 1,200 millions of alpha rays are concerned in its\r\ngenesis. The number of ions involved, of course, greatly exceeds\r\nthese numbers. A single alpha ray fired from radium C will\r\nproduce 2.37 x 105 ions in air.\r\n\r\nBut haloes may be found quite clearly defined and fairly dark out\r\nto the range of the emanation ray and derived from much less\r\nquantities of radioactive materials. Thus a zircon nucleus with a\r\ndiameter of but 3.4 x 10-4 cms. formed a halo strongly darkened\r\nwithin, and showing radium A and radium C as clear smoky rings.\r\nSuch a nucleus, on the assumption made above as to its radium\r\ncontent, expels one ray in a year. But, again, haloes are\r\nobserved with less blackened pupils and with faint ring due to\r\nradium C, formed round nuclei\r\n\r\n237\r\n\r\nof rather less than 2 x 10-4 cms. diameter. Such nuclei would\r\nexpel one ray in five years. And even lesser nuclei will generate\r\nin these old rocks haloes with their earlier characteristic\r\nfeatures clearly developed. In the case of the most minute\r\nnuclei, if my assumption as to the uranium content is correct, an\r\nalpha ray is expelled, probably, no oftener than once in a\r\ncentury; and possibly at still longer intervals.\r\n\r\nThe equilibrium amount of radium contained in some nuclei may\r\namount to only a few atoms. Even in the case of the larger nuclei\r\nand more perfectly developed haloes the quantity of radium\r\ninvolved is many millions of times less than the least amount we\r\ncan recognise by any other means. But the delicacy of the\r\nobservation is not adequately set forth in this statement. We can\r\nnot only tell the nature of the radioactive family with which we\r\nare dealing; but we can recognise the presence of some of its\r\nconstituent members. I may say that it is not probable the\r\nzircons are richer in radium than I have assumed. My assumption\r\ninvolves about 3 per cent. of uranium. I know of no analyses\r\nascribing so great an amount of uranium to zircon. The variety\r\ncyrtolite has been found to contain half this amount, about. But\r\neven if we doubled our estimate of radium content, the remarkable\r\nnature of our conclusions is hardly lessened.\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange that the ever-interesting question of the\r\nEarth's age should find elucidation from the\r\n\r\n238\r\n\r\nstudy of haloes. Nevertheless the subjects are closely connected.\r\nThe circumstances are as follows. Geologists have estimated the\r\nage of the Earth since denudation began, by measurements of the\r\nintegral effects of denudation. These methods agree in showing an\r\nage of about rob years. On the other hand, measurements have been\r\nmade of the accumulation in minerals of radioactive _débris_--the\r\nhelium and lead--and results obtained which, although they do not\r\nagree very well among themselves, are concordant in assigning a\r\nvery much greater age to the rocks. If the radioactive estimate\r\nis correct, then we are now living in a time when the denudative\r\nforces of the Earth are about eight or nine times as active as\r\nthey have been on the average over the past. Such a state of\r\nthings is absolutely unaccountable. And all the more\r\nunaccountable because from all we know we would expect a somewhat\r\n_lesser_ rate of solvent denudation as the world gets older and the\r\nland gets more and more loaded with the washed-out materials of\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nBoth the methods referred to of finding the age assume the\r\nprinciple of uniformity. The geologist contends for uniformity\r\nthroughout the past physical history of the Earth. The physicist\r\nclaims the like for the change-rates of the radioactive elements.\r\nNow the study of the rocks enables us to infer something as to\r\nthe past history of our Globe. Nothing is, on the other hand,\r\nknown respecting the origin of uranium or thorium--the parent\r\nradioactive bodies. And while not questioning the law\r\n\r\n239\r\n\r\nand regularity which undoubtedly prevail in the periods of the\r\nmembers of the radioactive families, it appears to me that it is\r\nallowable to ask if the change rate of uranium has been always\r\nwhat we now believe it to be. This comes to much the same thing\r\nas supposing that atoms possessing a faster change rate once were\r\nassociated with it which were capable of yielding both helium and\r\nlead to the rocks. Such atoms might have been collateral in\r\norigin with uranium from some antecedent element. Like helium,\r\nlead may be a derivative from more than one sequence of\r\nradioactive changes. In the present state of our knowledge the\r\npossibilities are many. The rate of change is known to be\r\nconnected with the range of the alpha ray expelled by the\r\ntransforming element; and the conformity of the halo with our\r\nexisting knowledge of the ranges is reason for assuming that,\r\nwhatever the origin of the more active associate of uranium, this\r\npassed through similar elemental changes in the progress of its\r\ndisintegration. There may, however, have been differences in the\r\nranges which the halo would not reveal. It is remarkable that\r\nuranium at the present time is apparently responsible for two\r\nalpha rays of very different ranges. If these proceed from\r\ndifferent elements, one should be faster in its change rate than\r\nthe other. Some guidance may yet be forthcoming from the study of\r\nthe more obscure problems of radioactivity.\r\n\r\nNow it is not improbable that the halo may contribute directly to\r\nthis discussion. We can evidently attack\r\n\r\n240\r\n\r\nthe biotite with a known number of alpha rays and determine how\r\nmany are required to produce a certain intensity of darkening,\r\ncorresponding to that of a halo with a nucleus of measurable\r\ndimensions. On certain assumptions, which are correct within\r\ndefined limits, we can calculate, as I have done above, the\r\nnumber of rays concerned in forming the halo. In doing so we\r\nassume some value for the age of the halo. Let us take the\r\nmaximum radioactive value. A halo originating in Devonian times\r\nmay attain a certain central blackening from the effects of, say,\r\nrob rays. But now suppose we find that we cannot produce the same\r\ndegree of blackening with this number of rays applied in the\r\nlaboratory. What are we to conclude? I think there is only the\r\none conclusion open to us; that some other source of alpha rays,\r\nor a faster rate of supply, existed in the past. And this\r\nconclusion would explain the absence of haloes from the younger\r\nrocks; which, in view of the vast range of effects possible in\r\nthe development of haloes, is, otherwise, not easy to account\r\nfor. It is apparent that the experiment on the biotite has a\r\ndirect bearing on the validity of the radioactive method of\r\nestimating the age of the rocks. It is now being carried out by\r\nProfessor Rutherford under reliable conditions.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is one very certain and valuable fact to be\r\nlearned from the halo. The halo has established the extreme\r\nrarity of radioactivity as an atomic phenomenon. One and all of\r\nthe speculations as to\r\n\r\n241\r\n\r\nthe slow breakdown of the commoner elements may be dismissed. The\r\nhalo shows that the mica of the rocks is radioactively sensitive.\r\nThe fundamental criterion of radioactive change is the expulsion\r\nof the alpha ray. The molecular system of the mica and of many\r\nother minerals is unstable in presence of these rays, just as a\r\nphotographic plate is unstable in presence of light. Moreover,\r\nthe mineral integrates the radioactive effects in the same way as\r\na photographic salt integrates the effects of light. In both\r\ncases the feeblest activities become ultimately apparent to our\r\ninspection. We have seen that one ray in each year since the\r\nDevonian period will build the fully formed halo: an object\r\nunlike any other appearance in the rocks. And we have been able\r\nto allocate all the haloes so far investigated to one or the\r\nother of the known radioactive families. We are evidently\r\njustified in the belief that had other elements been radioactive\r\nwe must either find characteristic haloes produced by them, or\r\nelse find a complete darkening of the mica. The feeblest alpha\r\nrays emitted by the relatively enormous quantities of the\r\nprevailing elements, acting over the whole duration of geological\r\ntime--and it must be remembered that the haloes we have been\r\nstudying are comparatively young--must have registered their\r\neffects on the sensitive minerals. And thus we are safe in\r\nconcluding that the common elements, and, indeed, many which\r\nwould be called rare, are possessed of a degree of stability\r\nwhich has preserved them un\r\n\r\n242\r\n\r\nchanged since the beginning of geological time. Each unaffected\r\nflake of mica is, thus, unassailable proof of a fact which but\r\nfor the halo would, probably, have been for ever beyond our\r\ncognisance.\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF RADIUM IN MEDICINE [1]\r\n\r\nIT has been unfortunate for the progress of the radioactive\r\ntreatment of disease that its methods and claims involve much of\r\nthe marvellous. Up till recently, indeed, a large part of\r\nradioactive therapeutics could only be described as bordering on\r\nthe occult. It is not surprising that when, in addition to its\r\noccult and marvellous characters, claims were made on its behalf\r\nwhich in many cases could not be supported, many medical men came\r\nto regard it with a certain amount of suspicion.\r\n\r\nToday, I believe, we are in a better position. I think it is\r\npossible to ascribe a rational scientific basis to its legitimate\r\nclaims, and to show, in fact, that in radioactive treatment we\r\nare pursuing methods which have been already tried extensively\r\nand found to be of definite value; and that new methods differ\r\nfrom the old mainly in their power and availability, and little,\r\nor not at all, in kind.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly review the basis of the science. Radium is a\r\nmetallic element chemically resembling barium. It\r\n\r\n[1] A Lecture to Postgraduate Students of Medicine in connection\r\nwith the founding of the Dublin Radium Institute, delivered in\r\nthe School of Physic in Ireland, Trinity College, on October 2nd,\r\n1914\r\n\r\n244\r\n\r\npossesses, however, a remarkable property which barium does not.\r\nIts atoms are not equally stable. In a given quantity of radium a\r\ncertain very small percentage of the total number of atoms\r\npresent break up per second. By \"breaking up\" we mean their\r\ntransmutation to another element. Radium, which is a solid\r\nelement under ordinary conditions, gives rise by transmutation to\r\na gaseous element--the emanation of radium. The new element is a\r\nheavy gas at ordinary temperatures and, like other gases, can be\r\nliquified by extreme cold. The extraordinary property of\r\ntransmutation is entirely automatic. No influence which chemist\r\nor physicist can apply can affect the rate of transformation.\r\n\r\nThe emanation inherits the property of instability, but in its\r\ncase the instability is more pronounced. A relatively large\r\nfraction of its atoms transmute per second to a solid element\r\ndesignated Radium A. In turn this new generation of atoms breaks\r\nup--even faster than the emanation--becoming yet another element\r\nwith specific chemical properties. And so on for a whole sequence\r\nof transmutations, till finally a stable substance is formed,\r\nidentical with ordinary lead in chemical and physical properties,\r\nbut possessing a slightly lower atomic weight.\r\n\r\nThe genealogy of the radium series of elements shows that radium\r\nis not the starting point. It possesses ancestors which have been\r\ntraced back to the element uranium.\r\n\r\nNow what bearing has this series of transmutations\r\n\r\n245\r\n\r\nupon medical science? Radium or emanation, &c., are not in the\r\nPharmacopoeia as are, say, arsenic or bismuth. The whole\r\nmedicinal value of these elements resides in the very wonderful\r\nphenomena of their radiations. They radiate in the process of\r\ntransmuting.\r\n\r\nThe changing atom may radiate a part of its own mass. The\r\n\"alpha\"-ray (a-ray) is such a material ray. It is an electrified\r\nhelium atom cast out of the parent atom with enormous\r\nvelocity--such a velocity as would carry it, if not impeded, all\r\nround the earth in two seconds. All alpha-rays are positively\r\nelectrified atoms of the element helium, which thereby is shown\r\nto be an integral constituent of many elements. The alpha-ray is\r\nnot of much value to medical science, for, in spite of its great\r\nvelocity, it is soon stopped by encounter with other atoms. It\r\ncan penetrate only a minute fraction of a millimetre into\r\nordinary soft tissues. We shall not further consider it.\r\n\r\nTransmuting atoms give out also material rays of another kind:\r\nthe ß-rays. The ß-ray is in mass but a very small fraction of,\r\neven, a hydrogen atom. Its speed may approach that of light. As\r\ncast out by radioactive elements it starts with speeds which vary\r\nwith the element, and may be from one-third to nine-tenths the\r\nvelocity of light. The ß-ray is negatively electrified. It has\r\nlong been known to science as the electron. It is also identical\r\nwith the cathode ray of the vacuum tube.\r\n\r\n246\r\n\r\nAnother and quite different kind of radiation is given out by\r\nmany of the transmuting elements:--the y-ray. This is not\r\nmaterial, it is ethereal. It is known now with certainty that the\r\ny-ray is in kind identical with light, but of very much shorter\r\nwave length than even the extreme ultraviolet light of the solar\r\nspectrum. The y-ray is flashed from the transmuting atom along\r\nwith the ß-ray. It is identical in character with the x-ray but\r\nof even shorter wave length.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting connection between the y-ray and the\r\nß-ray which it is important for the medical man to understand--as\r\nfar as it is practicable on our present knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen y-rays or x-rays fall on matter they give rise to ß-rays.\r\nThe mechanism involved is not known but it is possibly a result\r\nof the resonance of the atom, or of parts of it, to the short\r\nlight waves. And it is remarkable that the y-rays which, as we\r\nhave seen, are shorter and more penetrating waves than the\r\nx-rays, give rise to ß-rays possessed of greater velocity and\r\npenetration than ß-rays excited by the x-rays. Indeed the ß-rays\r\noriginated by y-rays may attain a velocity nearly approaching\r\nthat of light and as great as that of any ß-rays emitted by\r\ntransmuting atoms. Again there is demonstrable evidence that\r\nß-rays impinging on matter may give rise to y-rays. The most\r\nremarkable demonstration of this is seen in the x-ray tube. Here\r\nthe x-rays originate where the stream of ß- or cathode-rays\r\n\r\n247\r\n\r\nare arrested on the anode. But the first relation is at present\r\nof most importance to us--_i.e._ that the y-or x-rays give rise to\r\nß-rays.\r\n\r\nThis relation gives us additional evidence of the identity of the\r\nphysical effects of y-, x-, and light-rays --using the term light\r\nrays in the usual sense of spectral rays. For it has long been\r\nknown that light waves liberate electrons from atoms. It has been\r\nfound that these electrons possess a certain initial velocity\r\nwhich is the greater the shorter the wave length of the light\r\nconcerned in their liberation. The whole science of\r\n\"photo-electricity\" centres round this phenomenon. The action of\r\nlight on the photographic plate, as well as many other physical\r\nand chemical phenomena, find an explanation in this liberation of\r\nthe electron by the light wave.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have spectral light waves liberating\r\nelectrons--_i.e._ very minute negatively-charged particles, and we\r\nfind that, as we use shorter light waves, the initial velocity of\r\nthese particles increases. Again, we have x-rays which are far\r\nsmaller in wave length than spectral light, liberating much\r\nfaster negatively electrified particles. Finally, we have\r\ny-rays--the shortest nether waves of all-liberating negative\r\nparticles of the highest velocity known. Plainly the whole series\r\nof phenomena is continuous.\r\n\r\nWe can now look closer at the actions involved in the therapeutic\r\ninfluence of the several rays and in\r\n\r\n248\r\n\r\nthis way, also, see further the correlation between what may be\r\ncalled photo-therapeutics and radioactive therapeutics.\r\n\r\nThe ß-ray, whether we obtain it directly from the transforming\r\nradioactive atom or whether we obtain it as a result of the\r\neffects of the y- or x-rays upon the atom, is an ionising agent\r\nof wonderful power. What is meant by this? In its physical aspect\r\nthis means that the atoms through which it passes acquire free\r\nelectric charges; some becoming positive, some negative. This can\r\nonly be due to the loss of an electron by the affected atom. The\r\nloss of the small negative charge carried in the electron leaves\r\nthe atom positively electrified or creates a positive ion. The\r\nfixing of the wandering electron to a neutral atom creates a\r\nnegative ion. Before further consideration of the importance of\r\nthe phenomenon of ionisation we must fix in our minds that the\r\nagent, which brings this about, is the ß-ray. There is little\r\nevidence that the y-ray can directly create ions to any large\r\nextent. But the action of liberating high-speed ß-rays results in\r\nthe creation of many thousands of ions by each ß-ray liberated.\r\nAs an agent in the hands of the medical man we must regard the\r\ny-ray as a light wave of extremely penetrating character, which\r\ncreates high-speed ß-rays in the tissues which it penetrates,\r\nthese ß-rays being most potent ionising agents. The ß-rays\r\ndirectly obtained from radioactive atoms assist in the work of\r\nionisation. ß-rays do not\r\n\r\n249\r\n\r\npenetrate far from their source. The fastest of them would not\r\nprobably penetrate one centimetre in soft tissues.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the phenomenon of ionisation. Ionisation is\r\nrevealed to observation most conspicuously when it takes place in\r\na gas. The + and - electric charges on the gas particles endow it\r\nwith the properties of a conductor of electricity, the + ions\r\nmoving freely in one direction and the - ions in the opposite\r\ndirection under an electric potential. But there are effects\r\nbrought about by ionisation of more importance to the medical man\r\nthan this. The chemist has long come to recognise that in the ion\r\nhe is concerned with the inner mechanism of a large number of\r\nchemical phenomena. For with the electrification of the atom\r\nattractive and repulsive forces arise. We can directly show the\r\nchemical effects of the ionising ß-rays. Water exposed to their\r\nbombardment splits up into hydrogen and oxygen. And, again, the\r\nseparated atoms may be in part recombined under the influence of\r\nthe radiation. Ammonia splits up into hydrogen and nitrogen.\r\nCarbon dioxide forms carbon, carbon monoxide, and oxygen;\r\nhydrochloric acid forms chlorine and hydrogen. In these cases,\r\nalso, recombination can be partially effected by the rays.\r\n\r\nWe can be quite sure that within the complex structure of the\r\nliving cell the ionising effects which everywhere accompany the\r\nß-rays must exert a profound influence. The sequence of chemical\r\nevents which as yet seem\r\n\r\n250\r\n\r\nbeyond the ken of science and which are involved in metabolism\r\ncannot fail to be affected. Any, it is not surprising that as the\r\nresult of eaperinient it is found that the radiations are agents\r\nwhich may be used either for the stimulation of the natural\r\nevents of growth or used for the actual destruction of the cell.\r\nIt is easy to see that the feeble radiation should produce the\r\none effect, the strong the other. In a similar way by a moderate\r\nlight stimulus we create the latent image in the photographic\r\nplate; by an intense light we again destroy this image. The inner\r\nmechanism in this last case can be logically stated.[1]\r\n\r\n_There is plainly a true physical basis here for the efficacy of\r\nradioactive treatment and, what is more, we find when we examine\r\nit, that it is in kind not different from that underlying\r\ntreatment by spectral radiations. But in degree it is very\r\ndifferent and here is the reason for the special importance of\r\nradioactivity as a therapeutic agent._ The Finsen light is capable\r\nof influencing the soft tissues to a short depth only. The reason\r\nis that the wave length of the light used is too great to pass\r\nwithout rapid absorption through the tissues; and, further, the\r\nelectrons it gives rise to--_i.e._ the ß-rays it liberates--are too\r\nslow-moving to be very efficient ionisers. X-rays penetrate in\r\nsome cases quite freely and give rise to much faster and more\r\npowerful ß-rays\r\n\r\n[1] See _The Latent Image_, p. 202.\r\n\r\n251\r\n\r\nthan can the Finsen light. But far more penetrating than x-rays\r\nare the y-rays emitted in certain of the radioactive changes.\r\nThese give rise to ß-rays having a velocity approximate to that\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nThe y-rays are, therefore, very penetrating and powerfully\r\nionising light waves; light waves which are quite invisible to\r\nthe eye and can beam right through the tissues of the body. To\r\nthe mind's eye only are they visible. And a very wonderful\r\npicture they make. We see the transmuting atom flashing out this\r\nlight for an inconceivably short instant as it throws off the\r\nß-ray. And \"so far this little candle throws his beams\" in the\r\ncomplex system of the cells, so far atoms shaken by the rays send\r\nout ß-rays; these in turn are hurled against other atomic\r\nsystems; fresh separations of electrons arise and new attractions\r\nand repulsions spring up and the most important chemical changes\r\nare brought about. Our mental picture can claim to be no more\r\nthan diagrammatic of the reality. Still we are here dealing with\r\nrecognised physical and chemical phenomena, and their description\r\nas \"occult\" in the derogatory sense is certainly not\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\nHaving now briefly reviewed the nature of the rays arising in\r\nradioactive substances and the rationale of their influence, we\r\nmust turn to more especially practical considerations.\r\n\r\nThe Table given opposite shows that radium itself is responsible\r\nfor a- and ß-rays only. It happens that\r\n\r\n252\r\n\r\nPeriod in whioh ½ element is transformed.\r\n\r\nURANIUM 1 & 2 { a 6 } x 109 years.\r\n\r\nURANIUM X { a ß } 24.6 days.\r\n\r\nIONIUM { a 8 } x 104 years.\r\n\r\nRADIUM { a ß } 2 x 102 years.\r\n\r\nEMANATION { a } 8.85 days.\r\n\r\nRADIUM A { a 8 } minutes.\r\n\r\nRADIUM B { ß y } 26.7 minutes.\r\n\r\nRADIUM C { a ß y } 13.5 minutes.\r\n\r\nRADIUM D { ß } 15 years.\r\n\r\nRADIUM E { ß y } 4.8 days.\r\n\r\nRADIUM (Polonium) F { a } 140 days.\r\n\r\nTable showing the successive generations of the elements of the\r\nUranium-radium family, the character of their radiations and\r\ntheir longevity.\r\n\r\n253\r\n\r\nthe ß-rays emitted by radium are very \"soft\"--_i.e._ slow and\r\neasily absorbed. The a-ray is in no case available for more than\r\nmere surface application. Hence we see that, contrary to what is\r\ngenerally believed, radium itself is of little direct therapeutic\r\nvalue. Nor is the next body in succession--the emanation, for it\r\ngives only a-rays. In fact, to be brief, it is not till we come\r\nto Radium B that ß-rays of a relatively high penetrative quality\r\nare reached; and it is not till we come to Radium C that highly\r\npenetrative y-rays are obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is around this element, Radium C, that the chief medical\r\nimportance of radioactive treatment by this family of radioactive\r\nbodies centres. Not only are ß-rays of Radium C very penetrating,\r\nbut the y-rays are perhaps the most energetic rays of the, kind\r\nknown. Further in the list there is no very special medical\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nNow, how can we get a supply of this valuable element Radium C?\r\nWe can obtain it from radium itself. For even if radium has been\r\ndeprived of its emanation (which is easily done by heating it or\r\nbringing it into solution) in a few weeks we get back the Radium\r\nC. One thing here we must be clear about. With a given quantity\r\nof Radium only a certain definitely limited amount of Radium C,\r\nor of emanation, or any other of the derived bodies, will be\r\nassociated. Why is this? The answer is because the several\r\nsuccessive elements are themselves decaying --_i.e._ changing one\r\ninto the other. The atomic per-\r\n\r\n254\r\n\r\ncentage of each, which decays in a second, is a fixed quantity\r\nwhich we cannot alter. Now if we picture radium which has been\r\ncompletely deprived of its emanation, again accumulating by\r\nautomatic transmutation a fresh store of this element, we have to\r\nremember:-- (i) That the rate of creation of emanation by the\r\nradium is practically constant; and (2) that the absolute amount\r\nof the emanation decaying per second increases as the stock of\r\nemanation increases. Finally, when the amount of accumulated\r\nemanation has increased to such an extent that the number of\r\nemanation atoms transmuting per second becomes exactly equal to\r\nthe number being generated per second, the amount of emanation\r\npresent cannot increase. This is called the equilibrium amount.\r\nIf fifteen members are elected steadily each year into a\r\nnewly-founded society the number of members will increase for the\r\nfirst few years; finally, when the losses by death of the members\r\nequal about fifteen per annum the society can get no bigger. It\r\nhas attained the equilibrium number of members.\r\n\r\nThis applies to every one of the successive elements. It takes\r\ntwenty-one days for the equilibrium quantity of emanation to be\r\nformed in radium which has been completely de-emanated; and it\r\ntakes 3.8 days for half the equilibrium amount to be formed.\r\nAgain, if we start with a stock of emanation it takes just three\r\nhours for the equilibrium amount of Radium C to be formed.\r\n\r\n255\r\n\r\nWe can evidently grow Radium C either from radium itself or from\r\nthe emanation of radium. If we use a tube of radium we have an\r\nalmost perfectly constant quantity of Radium C present, for as\r\nfast as the Radium C and intervening elements decay the Radium,\r\nwhich only diminishes very slowly in amount, makes up the loss.\r\nBut, if we start off with a tube of emanation, we do not possess\r\na constant supply of Radium C, because the emanation is decaying\r\nfairly rapidly and there is no radium to make good its loss. In\r\n3.8 days about one half the emanation is transmuted and the\r\nRadium C decreases proportionately and, of course, with the\r\nRadium C the valuable radiations also decrease. In another 3.8\r\ndays--that is in about a week from the start--the radioactive value\r\nof the tube has fallen to one-fourth of its original value.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the inconstant character of the emanation tube\r\nthere are many reasons for preferring its use to the use of the\r\nradium tube. Chief of these is the fact that we can keep the\r\nprecious radium safely locked up in the laboratory and not\r\nexposed to the thousand-and-one risks of the hospital. Then,\r\nsecondly, the emanation, being a gas, is very convenient for\r\nsubdivision into a large number of very small tubes according to\r\nthe dosage required.\r\n\r\nIn fact the volume of the emanation is exceedingly minute. The\r\namount of emanation in equilibrium with one gramme of radium is\r\ncalled the curie, and with one\r\n\r\n256\r\n\r\nmilligramme the millicurie. Now, the volume of the curie is only\r\na little more than one half a cubic millimetre. Hence in dealing\r\nwith emanation from twenty or forty milligrammes of radium we are\r\ndealing with very small volumes.\r\n\r\nHow may the emanation be obtained? The process is an easy one in\r\nskilled and practised hands. The salt of radium--generally the\r\nbromide or chloride--is brought into acid solution. This causes\r\nthe emanation to be freely given off as fast as it is formed. At\r\nintervals we pump it off with a mercury pump.\r\n\r\nLet us see how many millicuries we will in future be able to turn\r\nout in the week in our new Dublin Radium Institute.[1] We shall\r\nhave about 130 milligrammes of radium. In 3.8 days we get 65\r\nmillicuries from this--_i.e._ half the equilibrium amount of 130\r\nmillicuries. Hence in the week, we shall have about 130\r\nmillicuries.\r\n\r\nThis is not much. Many experts consider this little enough for\r\none tube. But here in Dublin we have been using the emanation in\r\na more economical and effective manner than is the usage\r\nelsewhere; according to a method which has been worked out and\r\ndeveloped in our own Radium Institute. The economy is obtained by\r\nthe very simple expedient of minutely subdividing the' dose. The\r\nsystem in vogue, generally, is to treat the tumour by inserting\r\ninto it one or two very active\r\n\r\n[1] Then recently established by the Royal Dublin Society.\r\n\r\n257\r\n\r\ntubes, containing, perhaps, up to 200 millicuries, or even more,\r\nper tube. Now these very heavily charged tubes give a radiation\r\nso intense at points close to the tube, due to the greater\r\ndensity of the rays near the tube, and, also, to the action of\r\nthe softer and more easily absorbable rays, that it has been\r\nfound necessary to stop these softer rays--both the y and ß--by\r\nwrapping lead or platinum round the tube. In this lead or\r\nplatinum some thirty per cent. or more of the rays is absorbed\r\nand, of course, wasted. But in the absence of the screen there is\r\nextensive necrosis of the tissues near the tubes.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in place of one or two such tubes we use ten or\r\ntwenty, each containing one-tenth or one-twentieth of the dose,\r\nwe can avail ourselves of the softer rays around each tube with\r\nbenefit. Thus a wasteful loss is avoided. Moreover a more uniform\r\n\"illumination\" of the tissues results, just as we can illuminate\r\na hall more uniformly by the use of many lesser centres of light\r\nthan by the use of one intense centre of radiation. Also we get\r\nwhat is called \"cross-radiation,\"which is found to be beneficial.\r\nThe surgeon knows far better what he is doing by this method.\r\nThus it may be arranged for the effects to go on with approximate\r\nuniformity throughout the tumour instead of varying rapidly\r\naround a central point or--and this may be very important-- the\r\neffects may be readily concentrated locally.\r\n\r\nFinally, not the least of the benefit arises in the easy\r\ntechnique of this new method. The quantities of\r\n\r\n258\r\n\r\nemanation employed can fit in the finest capillary glass tubing\r\nand the hairlike tubes can in turn be placed in fine exploring\r\nneedles. There is comparatively little inconvenience to the\r\npatient in inserting these needles, and there is the most perfect\r\ncontrol of the dosage in the number and strength of these tubes\r\nand the duration of exposure.[1]\r\n\r\nThe first Radium Institute in Ireland has already done good work\r\nfor the relief of human suffering. It will have, I hope, a great\r\nfuture before it, for I venture, with diffidence, to hold the\r\nopinion, that with increased study the applications and claims of\r\nradioactive treatment will increase.\r\n\r\n[1] For particulars of the new technique and of some of the work\r\nalready accomplished, see papers, by Dr. Walter C. Stevenson,\r\n_British Medical Journal_, July 4th, 1914, and March 20th, 1915.\r\n\r\n259\r\n\r\nSKATING [1]\r\n\r\nIT is now many years ago since, as a student, I was present at a\r\ncollege lecture delivered by a certain learned professor on the\r\nsubject of friction. At this lecture a discussion arose out of a\r\nquestion addressed to our teacher: \"How is it we can skate on ice\r\nand on no other substance?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came back without hesitation: \"Because the ice is so\r\nsmooth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at once objected: \"But you can skate on ice which is not\r\nsmooth.\"\r\n\r\nThis put the professor in a difficulty. Obviously it is not on\r\naccount of the smoothness of the ice. A piece of polished plate\r\nglass is far smoother than a surface of ice after the latter is\r\ncut up by a day's skating. Nevertheless, on the scratched and\r\ntorn ice-surface skating is still quite possible; on the smooth\r\nplate glass we know we could not skate.\r\n\r\nSome little time after this discussion, the connection between\r\nskating and a somewhat abstruse fact in physical science occurred\r\nto me. As the fact itself is one which has played a part in the\r\ngeological history of the earth,\r\n\r\n[1] A lecture delivered before the Royal Dublin Society in 1905.\r\n\r\n260\r\n\r\nand a part of no little importance, the subject of skating,\r\nwhereby it is perhaps best brought home to every one, is\r\ndeserving of our careful attention. Let not, then, the title of\r\nthis lecture mislead the reader as to the importance of its\r\nsubject matter.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to the explanation of the wonderful freedom of\r\nthe skater's movements, I wish to verify what I have inferred as\r\nto the great difference in the slipperiness of glass and the\r\nslipperiness of ice. Here is a slab of polished glass. I can\r\nraise it to any angle I please so that at length this brass\r\nweight of 250 grams just slips down when started with a slight\r\nshove. The angle is, as you see, about 12½ degrees. I now\r\ntransfer the weight on to this large slab of ice which I first\r\nrapidly dry with soft linen. Observe that the weight slips down\r\nthe surface of ice at a much lower angle. It is a very low angle\r\nindeed: I read it as between 4 and 5 degrees. We see by this\r\nexperiment that there is a great difference between the\r\nslipperiness of the two surfaces as measured by what is called\r\n\"the angle of friction.\" In this experiment, too, the glass\r\npossesses by far the smoother surface although I have rubbed the\r\ndeeper rugosities out of the ice by smoothing it with a glass\r\nsurface. Notwithstanding this, its surface is spotted with small\r\ncavities due to bubbles and imperfections. It is certain that if\r\nthe glass was equally rough, its angle of friction towards the\r\nbrass weight would be higher.\r\n\r\n261\r\n\r\nWe have, however, another comparative experiment to carry out. I\r\nmade as you saw a determination of the angle at which this weight\r\nof 250 grams just slipped on the ice. The lower surface of the\r\nweight, the part which presses on the ice, consists of a light,\r\nbrass curtain ring. This can be detached. Its mass is only 6½\r\ngrams, the curtain ring being, in fact, hollow and made of very\r\nthin metal. We have, therefore, in it a very small weight which\r\npresents exactly the same surface beneath as did the weight of\r\n250 grams. You see, now, that this light weight will not slip on\r\nice at 5 or 6 degrees of slope, but first does so at about io\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThis is a very important experiment as regards our present\r\ninquiry. Ice appears to possess more than one angle of friction\r\naccording as a heavy or a light weight is used to press upon it.\r\nWe will make the same experiment with the plate of glass. You see\r\nthat there is little or no difference in the angle of friction of\r\nbrass on glass when we press the surfaces together with a heavy\r\nor with a light weight. The light weight requires the same slope\r\nof 12½ degrees to make it slip.\r\n\r\nThis last result is in accordance with the laws of friction. We\r\nsay that when solid presses on solid, for each pair of substances\r\npressed together there is a constant ratio between the force\r\nrequired to keep one in motion over the other, and the force\r\npressing the solids together. This ratio is called\"the\r\ncoefficient of friction.\"The coefficient is, in fact, constant or\r\napproximately\r\n\r\n262\r\n\r\nso. I can determine the coefficient of friction from the angle of\r\nfriction by taking the tangent of the angle. The tangent of the\r\nangle of friction is the coefficient of friction. If, then, the\r\ncoefficient is constant, so, of course, must the angle of\r\nfriction be constant. We have seen that it is so in the case of\r\nmetal on glass, but not so in the case of metal on ice. This\r\ncurious result shows that there is something abnormal about the\r\nslipperiness of ice.\r\n\r\nThe experiments we have hitherto made are open to the reproach\r\nthat the surface of the ice is probably damp owing to the warmth\r\nof the air in contact with it. I have here a means of dealing\r\nwith a surface of cold, dry ice. This shallow copper tank about\r\n18 inches (45 cms.) long, and 4 inches (10 cms.) wide, is filled\r\nwith a freezing 'mixture circulated through it from a larger\r\nvessel containing ice melting in hydrochloric acid at a\r\ntemperature of about -18° C. This keeps the tank below the\r\nmelting point of ice. The upper surface of the tank is provided\r\nwith raised edges so that it can be flooded with water. The water\r\nis now frozen and its temperature is below 0° C. It is about\r\n10° C. I can place over the ice a roof-shaped cover made of two\r\ninclined slabs of thick plate glass. This acts to keep out warm\r\nair, and to do away with any possibility of the surface of the\r\nice being wet with water thawed from the ice. The whole tank\r\nalong with its roof of glass can be adjusted to any angle, and a,\r\nscale at the\r\n\r\n263\r\n\r\nraised end of the tank gives the angle of slope in degrees. A\r\nweight placed on the ice can be easily seen through the glass\r\ncover.\r\n\r\nThe weight we shall use consists of a very light ring of\r\naluminium wire which is rendered plainly visible by a ping-pong\r\nball attached above it. The weight rests now on a copper plate\r\nprovided for the purpose at the upper end of the tank. The plate\r\nbeing in direct contact beneath with the freezing mixture we are\r\nsure that the aluminium ring is no hotter than the ice. A light\r\njerk suffices to shake the weight on to the surface of the ice.\r\n\r\nWe find that this ring loaded with only the ping-pong ball, and\r\nweighing a total of 2.55 grams does not slip at the low angles. I\r\nhave the surface of the ice at an angle of rather over 13½, and\r\nonly by continuous tapping of the apparatus can it be induced to\r\nslip down. This is a coefficient of 0.24, and compares with the\r\ncoefficient of hard and smooth solids on one another. I now\r\nreplace the empty ping-pong ball by a similar ball filled with\r\nlead shot. The total weight is now 155 grams. You see the angle\r\nof slipping has fallen to 7°.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has made friction experiments knows how\r\nunsatisfactory and inconsistent they often are. We can only\r\ndiscuss notable quantities and broad results, unless the most\r\nconscientious care be taken to eliminate errors. The net result\r\nhere is that ice at about -10° C. when pressed on by a very light\r\nweight possesses a\r\n\r\n264\r\n\r\ncoefficient of friction comparable with the usual coefficients of\r\nsolids on solids, but when the pressure is increased, the\r\ncoefficient falls to about half this value.\r\n\r\nThe following table embodies some results obtained on the\r\nfriction of ice and glass, using the methods I have shown you.

Müller) - - - 0.016--0.032\r\nBest-greased surfaces (Perry) - 0.03--0.036\r\n\r\nYou perceive from the table that while the friction of brass or\r\naluminium on glass is quite independent of the weight used, that\r\nof brass or aluminium on ice depends in some way upon the weight,\r\nand falls in a very marked degree when the weight is heavy. Now,\r\nI think that if we had been on the look out for any abnormality\r\nin the friction of hard substances on ice, we would have rather\r\nanticipated a variation in the\r\n\r\n265\r\n\r\nother direction. We would have, perhaps, expected that a heavy\r\nweight would have given rise to the greater friction. I now turn\r\nto the explanation of this extraordinary result.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that it requires an expenditure of heat merely to\r\nconvert ice to water, the water produced being at the temperature\r\nof the ice, _i.e._ at 0° C., from which it is derived. The heat\r\nrequired to change the ice from the solid to the liquid state is\r\nthe latent heat of water. We take the unit quantity of heat to be\r\nthat which is required to heat 1 kilogram of water 1° C. Then if\r\nwe melt 1 kilogram of ice, we must supply it with 80 such units\r\nof heat. While melting is going on, there is no change of\r\ntemperature if the experiment is carefully conducted. The melting\r\nice and the water coming from it remain at 0° C. throughout the\r\noperation, and neither the thermometer nor your own sensations\r\nwould tell you of the amount of heat which was flowing in. The\r\nheat is latent or hidden in the liquid produced, and has gone to\r\ndo molecular work in the substance. Observe that if we supply\r\nonly 40 thermal units, we get only one-half the ice melted. If\r\nonly 10 units are supplied, then we get only one eighth of a\r\nkilogram of water, and no more nor less.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to recall to you these commonplaces of science\r\nbefore considering a mode of melting ice which is less generally\r\nknown, and which involves no supply of heat on your part. This\r\nmethod involves for its\r\n\r\n266\r\n\r\nunderstanding a careful consideration of the thermal properties\r\nof water in the solid state.\r\n\r\nIt must have been observed a very long time ago that water\r\nexpands when it freezes. Otherwise ice would not float on water;\r\nand, what is perhaps more important in your eyes, your water\r\npipes would not burst in winter when the water freezes therein.\r\nBut although the important fact of the expansion of water on\r\nfreezing was so long presented to the observation of mankind, it\r\nwas not till almost exactly the middle of the last century that\r\nJames Thomson, a gifted Irishman, predicted many important\r\nconsequences arising from the fact of the expansion of water on\r\nbecoming solid. The principles lie enunciated are perfectly\r\ngeneral, and apply in every case of change of volume attending\r\nchange of state. We are here only concerned with the case of\r\nwater and ice.\r\n\r\nJames Thomson, following a train of thought which we cannot here\r\npursue, predicted that owing to the fact of the expansion of\r\nwater on becoming solid, pressure will lower the melting point of\r\nice or the freezing point of water. Normally, as you are aware,\r\nthe temperature is 0° C. or 32° F. Thomson said that this would\r\nbe found to be the freezing point only at atmospheric pressure.\r\nHe calculated how much it would change with change of pressure.\r\nHe predicted that the freezing point would fall 0.0075 of a\r\ndegree Centigrade for each additional atmosphere of pressure\r\napplied to the water. Suppose,\r\n\r\n267\r\n\r\nfor instance, our earth possessed an atmosphere so heavy to as\r\nexert a thousand times the pressure of the existing atmosphere,\r\nthen water would not freeze at 0° C., but at -7.5° C. or about\r\n18° F. Again, in vacuo, that is when the pressure has been\r\nreduced to the relatively small vapour pressure of the water, the\r\nfreezing point is above 0° C., _i.e._ at 0.0075° C. In parts of\r\nthe ocean depths the pressure is much over a thousand\r\natmospheres. Fresh water would remain liquid there at\r\ntemperatures much below 0° C.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident enough, even to those not possessed of the\r\nscientific insight of James Thomson, that some such fact is to be\r\nanticipated. It is, however, easy to be wise after the event. It\r\nappeals to us in a general way that as water expands on freezing,\r\npressure will tend to resist the turning of it to ice. The water\r\nwill try to remain liquid in obedience to the pressure. It will,\r\ntherefore, require a lower temperature to induce it to become\r\nice.\r\n\r\nJames Thomson left his thesis as a prediction. But he predicted\r\nexactly what his distinguished brother, Sir William Thomson--later\r\nLord Kelvin--found to happen when the matter was put to the test\r\nof experiment. We must consider the experiment made by Lord\r\nKelvin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thomson's views, if a quantity of ice and water are\r\ncompressed, there must be _a fall of temperature_. The nature of\r\nhis argument is as follows:\r\n\r\n268\r\n\r\nLet the ice and water be exactly at 0° C. to start with. Then\r\nsuppose we apply, say, one thousand atmospheres pressure. The\r\nmelting point of the ice is lowered to -7.5° C. That is, it will\r\nrequire a temperature so low as -7.5° C. to keep it solid. It\r\nwill therefore at once set about melting, for as we have seen,\r\nits actual temperature is not -7.5° C., but a higher temperature,\r\n_i.e._ 0° C. In other words, it is 7.5° above its melting point.\r\nBut as soon as it begins melting it also begins to absorb heat to\r\nsupply the 80 thermal units which, as we know, are required to\r\nturn each kilogram of the ice to water. Where can it get this\r\nheat? We assume that we give it none. It has only two sources,\r\nthe ice can take heat from itself, and it can take heat from the\r\nwater. It does both in this case, and both ice and water drop in\r\ntemperature. They fall in temperature till -7.5° is reached. Then\r\nthe ice has got to its melting point under the pressure of one\r\nthousand atmospheres, or, as we may put it, the water has reached\r\nits freezing point. There can be no more melting. The whole mass\r\nis down to -7.5° C., and will stay there if we keep heat from\r\nflowing either into or out of the vessel. There is now more water\r\nand less ice in the vessel than when we started, and the\r\ntemperature has fallen to -7.5° C. The fall of temperature to the\r\namount predicted by the theory was verified by Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\nSuppose we now suddenly remove the pressure; what will happen? We\r\nhave water and ice at -7.5° C.\r\n\r\n269\r\n\r\nand at the normal pressure. Water at -7.5° and at the normal\r\npressure of course turns to ice. The water will, therefore,\r\ninstantly freeze in the vessel, and the whole process will be\r\nreversed. In freezing, the water will give up its latent heat,\r\nand this will warm up the whole mass till once again 0° C. is\r\nattained. Then there will be no more freezing, for again the ice\r\nis at its melting point. This is the remarkable series of events\r\nwhich James Thomson predicted. And these are the events which\r\nLord Kelvin by a delicate series of experiments, verified in\r\nevery respect.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had nothing but solid ice in the vessel at starting,\r\nwould the experiment result in the same way? Yes, it assuredly\r\nwould. The ice under the increased pressure would melt a little\r\neverywhere throughout its mass, taking the requisite latent heat\r\nfrom itself at the expense of its sensible heat, and the\r\ntemperature of the ice would fall to the new melting point.\r\n\r\nCould we melt the whole of the ice in this manner? Again the\r\nanswer is \"yes.\" But the pressure must be very great. If we\r\nassume that all the heat is obtained at the expense of the\r\nsensible heat of the ice, the cooling must be such as to supply\r\nthe latent heat of the whole mass of water produced. However, the\r\nlatent heat diminishes as the melting point is lowered, and at a\r\nrate which would reduce it to nothing at about 18,000\r\natmospheres. Mousson, operating on ice enclosed in a conducting\r\ncylinder and cooled to -18° at starting\r\n\r\n270\r\n\r\nappears to have obtained very complete liquefaction. Mousson must\r\nhave attained a pressure of at least an amount adequate to lower\r\nthe melting point below -18°. The degree of liquefaction actually\r\nattained may have been due in part to the passage of heat through\r\nthe walls of the vessel. He proved the more or less complete\r\nliquefaction of the ice within the vessel by the fall of a copper\r\nindex from the top to the bottom of the vessel while the pressure\r\nwas on.\r\n\r\nI have here a simple way of demonstrating to you the fall of\r\ntemperature attending the compression of ice. In this mould,\r\nwhich is strongly made of steel, lined with boxwood to diminish\r\nthe passage of conducted heat, is a quantity of ice which I\r\ncompress when I force in this plunger. In the ice is a\r\nthermoelectric junction, the wires leading to which are in\r\ncommunication with a reflecting galvanometer. The thermocouple is\r\nof copper and nickel, and is of such sensitiveness as to show by\r\nmotion of the spot of light on the screen even a small fraction\r\nof a degree. On applying the pressure, you see the spot of light\r\nis displaced, and in such a direction as to indicate cooling. The\r\nbalancing thermocouple is all the time imbedded in a block of ice\r\nso that its temperature remains unaltered. On taking off the\r\npressure, the spot of light returns to its first position. I can\r\nmove the spot of light backwards and forwards on the screen by\r\ntaking off and putting on the pressure. The effects are quite\r\ninstantaneous.\r\n\r\n271\r\n\r\nThe fact last referred to is very important. The ice, in fact, is\r\nas it were automatically turned to water. It is not a matter of\r\nthe conduction of heat from point to point in the ice. Its own\r\nsensible heat is immediately absorbed throughout the mass. This\r\nwould be the theoretical result, but it is probable that owing to\r\nimperfections throughout the ice and failure in uniformity in the\r\ndistribution of the stress, the melting would not take place\r\nquite uniformly or homogeneously.\r\n\r\nBefore applying our new ideas to skating, I want you to notice a\r\nfact which I have inferentially stated, but not specifically\r\nmentioned. Pressure will only lead to the melting of ice if the\r\nnew melting point, _i.e._ that due to the pressure, is below the\r\nprevailing temperature. Let us take figures. The ice to start\r\nwith is, say, at -3° C. Suppose we apply such a pressure to this\r\nice as will confer a melting point of -2° C. on it. Obviously,\r\nthere will be no melting. For why should ice which is at -3° C.\r\nmelt when its melting point is -2° C.? The ice is, in fact,\r\ncolder than its melting point. Hence, you note this fact: The\r\npressure must be sufficiently intense to bring the melting point\r\nbelow the prevailing temperature, or there will be no melting;\r\nand the further we reduce the melting point by pressure below the\r\nprevailing temperature, the more ice will be melted.\r\n\r\nWe come at length to the object of our remarks I don't know who\r\ninvented skating or skates. It is said that in the thirteenth\r\ncentury the inhabitants of\r\n\r\n272\r\n\r\nEngland used to amuse themselves by fastening the bones of an\r\nanimal beneath their feet, and pushing themselves about on the\r\nice by means of a stick pointed with iron. With such skates, any\r\nperformance either on inside or outside edge was impossible. We\r\nare a conservative people. This exhilarating amusement appears to\r\nhave served the people of England for three centuries. Not till\r\n1660 were wooden skates shod with iron introduced from the\r\nNetherlands. It is certain that skating was a fashionable\r\namusement in Pepys' time. He writes in 1662 to the effect: \"It\r\nbeing a great frost, did see people sliding with their skates,\r\nwhich is a very pretty art.\" It is remarkable that it was the\r\nGerman poet Klopstock who made skating fashionable in Germany.\r\nUntil his time, the art was considered a pastime, only fit for\r\nvery young or silly people.\r\n\r\nI wish now to dwell upon that beautiful contrivance the modern\r\nskate. It is a remarkable example of how an appliance can develop\r\ntowards perfection in the absence of a really intelligent\r\nunderstanding of the principles underlying its development. For\r\nwhat are the principles underlying the proper construction of the\r\nskate? After what I have said, I think you will readily\r\nunderstand. The object is to produce such a pressure under the\r\nblade that the ice will melt. We wish to establish such a\r\npressure under the skate that even on a day when the ice is below\r\nzero, its melting\r\n\r\n273\r\n\r\npoint is so reduced just under the edge of the skate that the ice\r\nturns to water.\r\n\r\nIt is this melting of the ice under the skate which secures the\r\ncondition essential to skating. In the first place, the skate no\r\nlonger rests on a solid. It rests on a liquid. You are aware how\r\nin cases where we want to reduce friction--say at the bearing of a\r\nwheel or under a pivot--we introduce a liquid. Look at the\r\nbearings of a steam engine. A continuous stream of oil is fed in\r\nto interpose itself between the solid surfaces. I need not\r\nillustrate so well-known a principle by experiment. Solid\r\nfriction disappears when the liquid intervenes. In its place we\r\nsubstitute the lesser difficulty of shearing one layer of the\r\nliquid over the other; and if we keep up the supply of oil the\r\nwork required to do this is not very different, no matter how\r\ngreat we make the pressure upon the bearings. Compared with the\r\nresistance of solid friction, the resistance of fluid friction is\r\ntrifling. Here under the skate the lubrication is perhaps the\r\nmost perfect which it is possible to conceive. J. Müller has\r\ndetermined the coefficient by towing a skater holding on by a\r\nspring balance. The coefficient is between 0.016 and 0.032. In\r\nother words, the skater would run down an incline so little as 1\r\nor 2 degrees; an inclination not perceivable by the eye. Now\r\nobserve that the larger of these coefficients is almost exactly\r\nthe same as that which Perry found in the case of well-greased\r\nsurfaces. But evidently no\r\n\r\n274\r\n\r\nartificial system of lubrication could hope to equal that which\r\nexists between the skate and the ice. For the lubrication here\r\nis, as it were, automatic. In the machine if the lubricant gets\r\nsqueezed out there instantly ensues solid friction. Under the\r\nskate this cannot happen for the squeezing out of the lubricant\r\nis instantly followed by the formation of another film of water.\r\nThe conditions of pressure which may lead to solid friction in\r\nthe machine here automatically call the lubricant into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nJust under the edge of the skate the pressure is enormous.\r\nConsider that the whole weight of the skater is born upon a mere\r\nknife edge. The skater alternately throws his whole weight upon\r\nthe edge of each skate. But not only is the weight thus\r\nconcentrated upon one edge, further concentration is secured in\r\nthe best skates by making the skate hollow-ground, _i.e._\r\nincreasing the keenness of the edge by making it less than a\r\nright angle. Still greater pressure is obtained by diminishing\r\nthe length of that part of the blade which is in contact with the\r\nice. This is done by putting curvature on the blade or making it\r\nwhat is called \"hog-backed.\" You see that everything is done to\r\ndiminish the area in contact with the ice, and thus to increase\r\nthe pressure. The result is a very great compression of the ice\r\nbeneath the edge of the skate. Even in the very coldest weather\r\nmelting must take place to some extent.\r\n\r\nAs we observed before, the melting is instantaneous,\r\n\r\n275\r\n\r\nHeat has not to travel from one point of the ice to another;\r\nimmediately the pressure comes on the ice it turns to water. It\r\ntakes the requisite heat from itself in order that the change of\r\nstate may be accomplished. So soon as the skate passes on, the\r\nwater resumes the solid state. It is probable that there is an\r\ninstantaneous escape, and re-freezing of some of the water from\r\nbeneath the skate, the skate instantly taking a fresh bearing and\r\nmelting more ice. The temperature of the water escaping from\r\nbeneath the skate, or left behind by it, immediately becomes what\r\nit was before the skate pressed upon it.\r\n\r\nThus, a most wonderful and complex series of molecular events\r\ntakes place beneath the skate. Swift as it passes, the whole\r\nsequence of events which James Thomson predicted has to take\r\nplace beneath the blade Compression; lowering of the melting\r\npoint below the temperature of the surrounding ice; melting;\r\nabsorption of heat; and cooling to the new melting point, _i.e._\r\nto that proper to the pressure beneath the blade. The skate now\r\npasses on. Then follow: Relief of pressure; re-solidification of\r\nthe water; restoration of the borrowed heat from the congealing\r\nwater and reversion of the ice to the original temperature.\r\n\r\nIf we reflect for a moment on all this, we see that we do not\r\nskate on ice but on water. We could not skate on ice any more\r\nthan we could skate on glass. We saw that with light weights and\r\nwhen the pressure\r\n\r\n276\r\n\r\n{Diagram}\r\n\r\nDiagram showing successive states obtaining in ice, before,\r\nduring, and after the passage of the skate. The temperatures and\r\npressures selected for illustration are such as might occur under\r\nordinary conditions. The edge of the skate is shown in magnified\r\ncross-section.\r\n\r\n277\r\n\r\nWas not sufficient to melt the ice, the friction was much the\r\nsame as that of metal on glass. Ice is not slippery. It is an\r\nerror to say that it is. The learned professor was very much\r\nastray when he said that you could skate on ice because it is so\r\nsmooth. The smoothness of the ice has nothing to do with the\r\nmatter. In short, owing to the action of gravity upon your body,\r\nyou escape the normal resistance of solid on solid, and glide\r\nabout with feet winged like the messenger of the Gods; but on\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA second condition essential to the art of skating is also\r\ninvolved in the melting of the ice. The sinking of the skate\r\ngives the skater \"bite.\" This it is which enables him to urge\r\nhimself forward. So long as skates consisted of the rounded bones\r\nof animals, the skater had to use a pointed staff to propel\r\nhimself. In creating bite, the skater again unconsciously appeals\r\nto the peculiar physical properties of ice. The pressure required\r\nfor the propulsion of the skater is spread all along the length\r\nof the groove he has cut in the ice, and obliquely downwards. The\r\nskate will not slip away laterally, for the horizontal component\r\nof the pressure is not enough to melt the ice. He thus gets the\r\nresistance he requires.\r\n\r\nYou see what a very perfect contrivance the skate is; and what a\r\nsimilitude of intelligence there is in its evolution. Blind\r\nintelligence, because it is certain the true physics of skating\r\nwas never held in view by\r\n\r\n278\r\n\r\nthe makers of skates. The evolution of the skate has been truly\r\norganic. The skater selected the fittest skate, and hence the fit\r\nskate survived.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the possibility of skating depends on the dynamical\r\nmelting of ice under pressure. And observe the whole matter turns\r\nupon the apparently unrelated fact that the freezing of water\r\nresults in a solid more bulky than the water which gives rise to\r\nit. If ice was less bulky than the water from which it was\r\nderived, pressure would not melt it; it would be all the more\r\nsolid for the pressure, as it were. The melting point would rise\r\ninstead of falling. Most substances behave in this manner, and\r\nhence we cannot skate upon them. Only quite a few substances\r\nexpand on freezing, and it happens that their particular melting\r\ntemperatures or other properties render them unsuitable to\r\nskating. The most abundant fluid substance on the earth, and the\r\nmost abundant substance of any one kind on its surface, thus\r\npossesses the ideally correct and suitable properties for the art\r\nof skating.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that the pressure must be such as to bring the\r\ntemperature of melting below that prevailing in the ice at the\r\ntime. We have seen also, that one atmosphere lowers the melting\r\npoint of ice by the 1/140 of a degree Centigrade; more exactly by\r\n0.0075°. Let us now assume that the skate is so far sunken in the\r\nice as to bear for a length of two inches, and for a width of\r\none-hundredth of an inch. The skater weighs,\r\n\r\n279\r\n\r\nlet us say--150 pounds. If this weight was borne on one square\r\ninch, the pressure would be ten atmospheres. But the skater rests\r\nhis weight, in fact, upon an area of one-fiftieth of an inch. The\r\npressure is, therefore, fifty times as great. The ice is\r\nsubjected to a pressure of 500 atmospheres. This lowers the\r\nmelting point to -3.75° C. Hence, on a day when the ice is at\r\nthis temperature, the skate will sink in the ice till the weight\r\nof the skater is concentrated as we have assumed. His skate can\r\nsink no further, for any lesser concentration of the pressure\r\nwill not bring the melting point below the prevailing\r\ntemperature. We can calculate the theoretical bite for any state\r\nof the ice. If the ice is colder the bite will not be so deep. If\r\nthe temperature was twice as far below zero, then the area over\r\nwhich the skater's weight will be distributed, when the skate has\r\npenetrated its maximum depth, will be only half the former area,\r\nand the pressure will be one thousand atmospheres.\r\n\r\nAn important consideration arises from the fact that under the\r\nvery extreme edge of the skate the pressure is indefinitely\r\ngreat. For this involves that there will always be some bite,\r\nhowever cold the ice may be. That is, the narrow strip of ice\r\nwhich first receives the skater's weight must partially liquefy\r\nhowever cold the ice.\r\n\r\nIt must have happened to many here to be on ice which was too\r\ncold to skate on with comfort. The\r\n\r\n280\r\n\r\nskater in this case speaks of the ice as too hard. In the\r\nEngadine, the ice on the large lakes gets so cold that skaters\r\ncomplain of this. On the rinks, which are chiefly used there, the\r\nice is frequently renewed by flooding with water at the close of\r\nthe day. It thus never gets so very cold as on the lakes. I have\r\nbeen on ice in North France, which, in the early morning, was too\r\nhard to afford sufficient bite for comfort. The cause of this is\r\neasily understood from what we have been considering.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to the experimental results which we obtained\r\nearly in the lecture. The heavy weights slip off the ice at a low\r\nangle because just at the points of contact with the ice the\r\nlatter melts, and they, in fact, slip not on ice but on water.\r\nThe light weights on cold, dry ice do not lower the melting point\r\nbelow the temperature of the ice, _i.e._ below -10° C., and so\r\nthey slip on dry ice. They therefore give us the true coefficient\r\nof friction of metal on ice.\r\n\r\nThis subject has, more recently been investigated by H. Morphy,\r\nof Trinity College, Dublin. The refinement of a closed vessel at\r\nuniform temperature, in which the ice is formed and the\r\nexperiment carried out, is introduced. Thermocouples give the\r\ntemperatures, not only of the ice but of the aluminium sleigh\r\nwhich slips upon it under various loads. In this way we may be\r\ncertain that the metal runners are truly at the temperature of\r\nthe ice. I now quote from Morphy's paper\r\n\r\n281\r\n\r\n\"The angle of friction was found to remain constant until a\r\ncertain stage of the loading, when it suddenly fell to about half\r\nof its original value. It then remained constant for further\r\nincreases in the load.\r\n\r\n\"These results, which confirmed those obtained previously with\r\nless satisfactory apparatus, are shown in the table below. In the\r\nfirst column is shown the load, _i.e._ the weight of sleigh +\r\nweight of shot added. In the second and third columns are shown,\r\nrespectively, the coefficient and angle of friction, whilst the\r\nfourth gives the temperature of the ice as determined from the\r\ngalvanometer deflexions.\r\n\r\nLoad.

Happy the boy who has nails in his boots when\r\nJack-Frost appears in his white garment, and congeals the\r\nneighbouring pond. But I must turn away at the threshold of the\r\nhumorous aspect of my subject (for the victim of the street\r\n\"slide\" owes his injured dignity to the abstruse laws we have\r\nbeen discussing) and pass to other and graver subjects intimately\r\nconnected with skating.\r\n\r\nJames Thomson pointed out that if we apply compressional stress\r\nto an ice crystal contained in a vessel\r\n\r\n283\r\n\r\nwhich also contains other ice crystals, and water at 0° C., then\r\nthe stressed crystal will melt and become water, but its\r\ncounterpart or equivalent quantity of ice will reappear elsewhere\r\nin the vessel. This is, obviously, but a deduction from the\r\nprinciples we have been examining. The phenomenon is commonly\r\ncalled \"regelation.\" I have already made the usual regelation\r\nexperiment before you when I compressed broken ice in this mould.\r\nThe result was a clear, hard and almost flawless lens of ice. Now\r\nin this operation we must figure to ourselves the pieces of ice\r\nwhen pressed against one another melting away where compressed,\r\nand the water produced escaping into the spaces between the\r\nfragments, and there solidifying in virtue of its temperature\r\nbeing below the freezing point of unstressed water. The final\r\nresult is the uniform lens of ice. The same process goes on in a\r\nless perfect manner when you make--or shall I better say--when you\r\nmade snowballs.\r\n\r\nWe now come to theories of glacier motion; of which there are\r\ntwo. The one refers it mainly to regelation; the other to a real\r\nviscosity of the ice.\r\n\r\nThe late J. C. M'Connel established the fact that ice possesses\r\nviscosity; that is, it will slowly yield and change its shape\r\nunder long continued stresses. His observations, indeed, raise a\r\ndifficulty in applying this viscosity to explain glacier motion,\r\nfor he showed that an ice crystal is only viscous in a certain\r\nstructural\r\n\r\n284\r\n\r\ndirection. A complex mixture of crystals such, as we know glacier\r\nice to be, ought, we would imagine, to display a nett or\r\nresultant rigidity. A mass of glacier ice when distorted by\r\napplication of a force must, however, undergo precisely the\r\ntransformations which took place in forming the lens from the\r\nfragments of ice. In fact, regelation will confer upon it all the\r\nappearance of viscosity.\r\n\r\nLet us picture to ourselves a glacier pressing its enormous mass\r\ndown a Swiss valley. At any point suppose it to be hindered in\r\nits downward path by a rocky obstacle. At that point the ice\r\nturns to water just as it does beneath the skate. The cold water\r\nescapes and solidifies elsewhere. But note this, only where there\r\nis freedom from pressure. In escaping, it carries away its latent\r\nheat of liquefaction, and this we must assume, is lost to the\r\nregion of ice lately under pressure. This region will, however,\r\nagain warm up by conduction of heat from the surrounding ice, or\r\nby the circulation of water from the suxface. Meanwhile, the\r\npressure at that point has been relieved. The mechanical\r\nresistance is transferred elsewhere. At this new point there is\r\nagain melting and relief of pressure. In this manner the glacier\r\nmay be supposed to move down. There is continual flux of\r\nconducted heat and converted latent heat, hither and thither, to\r\nand from the points of resistance. The final motion of the whole\r\nmass is necessarily slow; a few feet in the day or, in winter,\r\n\r\n285\r\n\r\neven only a few inches. And as we might expect, perfect silence\r\nattends the downward slipping of the gigantic mass. The motion\r\nis, I believe, sufficiently explained as a skating motion. The\r\nskate is, however, fixed, the ice moves. The great Aletsch\r\nGlacier collects its snows among the highest summits of the\r\nOberland. Thence, the consolidated ice makes its way into the\r\nRhone Valley, travelling a distance of some 20 miles. The ice now\r\nmelting into the youthful Rhone fell upon the Monch, the Jungfrau\r\nor the Eiger in the days when Elizabeth ruled in England and\r\nShakespeare lived.\r\n\r\nThe ice-fall is a common sight on the glacier. In great lumps and\r\nbroken pinnacles it topples over some rocky obstacle and falls\r\nshattered on to the glacier below. But a little further down the\r\nwound is healed again, and regelation has restored the smooth\r\nsurface of the glacier. All such phenomena are explained on James\r\nThomson's exposition of the behaviour of a substance which\r\nexpands on passing from the liquid to the solid state.\r\n\r\nWe thus have arrived at very far-reaching considerations arising\r\nout of skating and its science. The tendency for snow to\r\naccumulate on the highest regions of the Earth depends on\r\nprinciples which we cannot stop to consider. We know it collects\r\nabove a certain level even at the Equator. We may consider, then,\r\nthat but for the operation of the laws which James Thomson\r\nbrought to light, and which his illustrious brother,\r\n\r\n286\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin, made manifest, the uplands of the Earth could not\r\nhave freed themselves of the burthen of ice. The geological\r\nhistory of the Earth must have been profoundly modified. The\r\nhigher levels must have been depressed; the general level of the\r\nocean relatively to the land thereby raised, and, it is even\r\npossible, that such a mean level might have been attained as\r\nwould result in general submergence.\r\n\r\nDuring the last great glacial period, we may say the fate of the\r\nworld hung on the operation of those laws which have concerned us\r\nthroughout this lecture. It is believed the ice was piled up to a\r\nheight of some 6,000 feet over the region of Scandinavia. Under\r\nthe influence of the pressure and fusion at points of resistance,\r\nthe accumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards the\r\naccumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards over Northern\r\nEurope. The Highlands of Scotland were covered with, perhaps,\r\nthree or four thousand feet of ice. Ireland was covered from\r\nnorth to south, and mighty ice-bergs floated from our western and\r\nsouthern shores.\r\n\r\nThe transported or erratic stones, often of great size, which are\r\nfound in many parts of Ireland, are records of these long past\r\nevents: events which happened before Man, as a rational being,\r\nappeared upon the Earth.\r\n\r\n287\r\n\r\nA SPECULATION AS TO A PREMATERIAL UNIVERSE [1]\r\n\r\n\"And therefore...these things likewise had a birth; for things\r\nwhich are of mortal body could not for an infinite time back...\r\nhave been able to set at naught the puissant strength of\r\nimmeasurable age.\"--LUCRETIUS, _De Rerum Natura._\r\n\r\n\"O fearful meditation! Where, alack! Shall Time's best jewel\r\nfrom Time's chest lie hid?\" --SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nIN the material universe we find presented to our senses a\r\nphysical development continually progressing, extending to all,\r\neven the most minute, material configurations. Some fundamental\r\ndistinctions existing between this development as apparent in the\r\norganic and the inorganic systems of the present day are referred\r\nto elsewhere in this volume.[2] In the present essay, these\r\nsystems as having a common origin and common ending, are merged\r\nin the same consideration as to the nature of the origin of\r\nmaterial systems in general. This present essay is occupied by\r\nthe consideration of the necessity of limiting material\r\ninteractions in past time. The speculation originated in the\r\ndifficulties which present themselves when we ascribe to these\r\ninteractions infinite duration in the past. These difficulties\r\nfirst claim our consideration.\r\n\r\n[1] Proc. Royal Dublin Soc., vol. vii., Part V, 1892.\r\n\r\n[2] _The Abundance of Life._\r\n\r\n288\r\n\r\nAccepting the hypothesis of Kant and Laplace in its widest\r\nextension, we are referred to a primitive condition of wide\r\nmaterial diffusion, and necessarily too of material instability.\r\nThe hypothesis is, in fact, based upon this material instability.\r\nWe may pursue the sequence of events assumed in this hypothesis\r\ninto the future, and into the past.\r\n\r\nIn the future we find finality to progress clearly indicated. The\r\nhypothesis points to a time when there will be no more\r\nprogressive change but a mere sequence of unfruitful events, such\r\nas the eternal uniform motion of a mass of matter no longer\r\ngaining or losing heat in an ether possessed of a uniform\r\ndistribution of energy in all its parts. Or, again, if the ether\r\nabsorb the energy of material motion, this vast and dark\r\naggregation eternally poised and at rest within it. The action is\r\ntransferred to the subtle parts of the ether which suffer none of\r\nthe energy to degrade. This is, physically, a thinkable future.\r\nOur minds suggest no change, and demand none. More than this,\r\nchange is unthinkable according to our present ideas of energy.\r\nOf progress there is an end.\r\n\r\nThis finality _â parte post_ is instructive. Abstract\r\nconsiderations, based on geometrical or analytical illustrations,\r\nquestion the finiteness of some physical developments. Thus our\r\nsun may require eternal time to attain the temperature of the\r\nether around it, the approach to this condition being assumed to\r\nbe asymptotic in\r\n\r\n289\r\n\r\ncharacter. But consider the legitimate _reductio ad absurdum_ of\r\nan ember raked from a fire 1000 years ago. Is it not yet cooled\r\ndown to the constant temperature of its surroundings? And we may\r\nevidently increase the time a million-fold if we please. It\r\nappears as if we must regard eternity as outliving every\r\nprogressive change, For there is no convergence or enfeeblement\r\nof time. The ever-flowing present moves no differently for the\r\noccurrence of the mightiest or the most insignificant events. And\r\neven if we say that time is only the attendant upon events, yet\r\nthis attendant waits patiently for the end, however long\r\ndeferred.\r\n\r\nDoes the essentially material hypothesis of Kant and Laplace\r\naccount for an infinite past as thinkably as it accounts for the\r\ninfinite future? As this hypothesis is based upon material\r\ninstability the question resolves itself into this:-- Is the\r\nassumption of an infinitely prolonged past instability a probable\r\nor possible account of the past? There are, it appears to me,\r\ngreat difficulties involved in accepting the hypothesis of\r\ninfinitely prolonged material instability. I will refer here to\r\nthree principal objections. The first may be called a\r\nmetaphysical objection; the second is partly metaphysical and\r\npartly physical, the third may be considered a physical\r\nobjection, as it is involved directly in the phenomena presented\r\nby our universe.\r\n\r\nThe metaphysical objection must have presented itself to every\r\none who has considered the question. It may\r\n\r\n290\r\n\r\nbe put thus:--If present events are merely one stage in an\r\ninfinite progress, why is not the present stage long ago passed\r\nover? We are evidently at liberty to push back any stage of\r\nprogress to as remote a period as we like by putting back first\r\nthe one before this and next the stage preceding this, and so on,\r\nfor, by hypothesis, there is no beginning to the progress.\r\n\r\nThus, the sum of passing events constituting the present universe\r\nshould long ago have been accomplished and passed away. If we\r\nconsider alternative hypotheses not involving this difficulty, we\r\nare at once struck by the fact that the future of material\r\ndevelopment is free of the objection. For the eternity of\r\nunprogressive events involved in the future on Kant's hypothesis,\r\nis not only thinkable, but any change is, as observed,\r\nirreconcilable with our ideas of energy. As in the future so in\r\nthe past we look to a cessation to progress. But as we believe\r\nthe activity of the present universe must in some form have\r\nexisted all along, the only refuge in the past is to imagine an\r\nactive but unprogressive eternity, the unprogressive activity at\r\nsome period becoming a progressive activity--that progressive\r\nactivity of which we are spectators. To the unprogressive\r\nactivity there was no beginning; in fact, beginning is as\r\nunthinkable and uncalled for to the unprogressive activity of the\r\npast as ending is to the unprogressive activity of the future,\r\nwhen all developmental actions shall have ceased. There is no\r\nbeginning or ending to the activity of the universe.\r\n\r\n291\r\n\r\nThere is beginning and ending to present progressive activity.\r\nLooking through the realm of nature we seek beginning and ending,\r\nbut \"passing through nature to eternity\" we find neither. Both\r\nare justified; the questioning of the ancient poet regarding the\r\npast, and of the modern regarding the future, quoted at the head\r\nof this essay.\r\n\r\nThe next objection, which is in part metaphysical, is founded on\r\nthe difficulty of ascribing any ultimate reality or potency to\r\nforces diminishing through eternal time. Thus, against the\r\nassumption that our universe is the result of material\r\naggregation progressing over eternal time, which involves the\r\nprimitive infinite separation of the particles, we may ask, what\r\nforce can have acted between particles sundered by infinite\r\ndistance? The gravitational force falling off as the square of\r\nthe distance, must vanish at infinity if we mean what we say when\r\nwe ascribe infinite separation to them. Their condition is then\r\none of neutral stability, a finite movement of the particles\r\nneither increasing nor diminishing interaction. They had then\r\nremained eternally in their separated condition, there being no\r\ncause to render such condition finite. The difficulty involved\r\nhere appears to me of the same nature as the difficulty of\r\nascribing any residual heat to the sun after eternal time has\r\nelapsed. In both cases we are bound to prolong the time, from our\r\nvery idea of time, till progress is no more, when in the one case\r\nwe can imagine no mutual approximation of the\r\n\r\n292\r\n\r\nparticles, in the other no further cooling of the body. However,\r\nI will riot dwell further upon this objection, as it does not, I\r\nbelieve, present itself with equal force to every mind. A reason\r\nless open to dispute, as being less subjective, against the\r\naggregation of infinitely remote particles as the origin of our\r\nuniverse, is contained in the physical objection.\r\n\r\nIn this objection we consider that the appearance presented by\r\nour universe negatives the hypothesis of infinitely prolonged\r\naggregation. We base this negation upon the appearance of\r\nsimultaneity ~ presented by the heavens, contending that this\r\nsimultaneity is contrary to what we would expect to find in the\r\ncase of particles gathered from infinitely remote distances.\r\nWhether these particles were endowed with relative motions or not\r\nis unimportant to the consideration. In what respects do the\r\nphenomena of our universe present the appearance of simultaneous\r\nphenomena? We must remember that the suns in space are as fires\r\nwhich brighten only for a moment and are then extinguished. It is\r\nin this sense we must regard the longest burning of the stars.\r\nWhether just lit or just expiring counts little in eternity. The\r\nlight and heat of the star is being absorbed by the ether of\r\nspace as effectually and rapidly as the ocean swallows the ripple\r\nfrom the wings of an expiring insect. Sir William Herschel says\r\nof the galaxy of the milky way:-- \"We do not know the rate of\r\nprogress of this mysterious chronometer, but it is nevertheless\r\ncertain that it cannot\r\n\r\n293\r\n\r\nlast for ever, and its past duration cannot be infinite.\" We do\r\nnot know, indeed, the rate of progress of the chronometer, but if\r\nthe dial be one divided into eternal durations the consummation\r\nof any finite physical change represents such a movement of the\r\nhand as is accomplished in a single vibration of the balance\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nHence we must regard the hosts of glittering stars as a\r\nconflagration that has been simultaneously lighted up in the\r\nheavens. The enormous (to our ideas) thermal energy of the stars\r\nresembles the scintillation of iron dust in a jar of oxygen when\r\na pinch of the dust is thrown in. Although some particles be\r\nburnt up before others become alight, and some linger yet a\r\nlittle longer than the others, in our day's work the\r\nscintillation of the iron dust is the work of a single instant,\r\nand so in the long night of eternity the scintillation of the\r\nmightiest suns of space is over in a moment. A little longer,\r\nindeed, in duration than the life which stirs a moment in\r\nresponse to the diffusion of the energy, but only very little. So\r\nmust an Eternal Being regard the scintillation of the stars and\r\nthe periodic vibration of life in our geological time and the\r\nmost enduring efforts of thought. The latter indeed are no more\r\nlasting than\r\n\r\n\"... the labour of ants In the light of a million million of\r\nsuns.\"\r\n\r\nBut the myriad suns themselves, with their generations, are the\r\nmomentary gleam of lights for ever after extinguished.\r\n\r\n294\r\n\r\nAgain, science suggests that the present process of material\r\naggregation is not finished, and possibly will only be when it\r\nprevails universally. Hence the very distribution of the stars,\r\nas we observe them, as isolated aggregations, indicates a\r\ndevelopment which in the infinite duration must be regarded as\r\nequally advanced in all parts of stellar space and essentially a\r\nsimultaneous phenomenon. For were we spectators of a system in\r\nwhich any very great difference of age prevailed, this very great\r\ndifference would be attended by some such appearance as the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nThe aupearance of but one star, other generations being long\r\nextinct or no others yet come into being; or, perhaps, a faint\r\nnebulous wreath of aggregating matter somewhere solitary in the\r\nheavens; or no sign of matter beyond our system, either because\r\nungathered or long passed away into darkness.[1]\r\n\r\nSome such appearances were to be expected had the aggregation of\r\nmatter depended solely on chance encounters of particles\r\nscattered through infinite space.\r\n\r\nFor as, by hypothesis, the aggregation occupies an infinite time\r\nin consummation it is nearly a certainty that each particle\r\nencountered after immeasurable time, and then for the first time\r\nendowed with actual gravitational potential energy, would have\r\nlong expended this energy\r\n\r\n[1] It is interesting to reflect upon the effect which an entire\r\nabsence of luminaries outside our solar system would have had\r\nupon the views of our philosophers and upon our outlook on life.\r\n\r\n295\r\n\r\nbefore another particle was gathered. But the fact that so many\r\nfires which we know to be of brief duration are scattered through\r\na region of space, and the fact of a configuration which we\r\nbelieve to be a transitory ore, suggest their simultaneous\r\naggregation here and there. And in the nebulous wreaths situated\r\namidst the stars there is evidence that these actually originated\r\nwhere they now are, for in such no relative motion, I believe,\r\nhas as yet been detected by the spectroscope. All this, too, is\r\nin keeping with the nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace so\r\nlong as this does not assume a primitive infinite dispersion of\r\nmatter, but the gathering of matter from finite distances first\r\ninto nebulous patches which aggregating with each other have\r\ngiven rise to our system of stars. But if we extend this\r\nhypothesis throughout an infinite past by the supposition of\r\naggregation of infinitely remote particles we replace the\r\nsimultaneous approach required in order to accotnt for the\r\nsimultaneous phenomena visible in the heavens, by a succession of\r\naggregative events, by hypothesis at intervals of nearly infinite\r\nduration, when the events of the universe had consisted of fitful\r\ngleams lighted after eternities of time and extinguished for yet\r\nother eternities.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we seek to replace the eternal instability involved\r\nin Kant's hypothesis when extended over an infinite past, by any\r\nhypothesis of material stability, we at once find ourselves in\r\nthe difficulty that from the known properties of matter such\r\nstability must have been\r\n\r\n296\r\n\r\npermanent if ever existent, which is contrary to fact. Thus the\r\nkinetic inertia expressed in Newton's first law of motion might\r\nwell be supposed to secure equilibrium with material attraction,\r\nbut if primevally diffused matter had ever thus been held in\r\nequilibrium it must have remained so, or it was maintained so\r\nimperfectly, which brings us back to endless evolution.\r\n\r\nOn these grounds I contend that the present gravitational\r\nproperties of matter cannot be supposed to have acted for all\r\npast duration. Universal equilibrium of gravitating particles\r\nwould have been indestructible by internal causes. Perpetual\r\ninstability or evolution is alike unthinkable and contrary to the\r\nphenomena of the universe of which we are cognisant. We therefore\r\nturn from gravitating matter as affording no rational account of\r\nthe past. We do so of necessity, however much we feel our\r\nignorance of the nature of the unknown actions to which we have\r\nrecourse.\r\n\r\nA prematerial condition of the universe was, we assume, a\r\ncondition in which uniformity as regards the average distribution\r\nof energy in space prevailed, but neterogeneity and instability\r\nwere possible. The realization of that possibility was the\r\nbeginning we seek, and we today are witnesses of the train of\r\nevents involved in the breakdown of an eternal past equilibrium.\r\nWe are witnesses on this hypothesis, of a catastrophe possibly\r\nconfined to certain regions of space, but which is, to the\r\nmotions and configurations concerned, absolutely unique,\r\nreversible to\r\n\r\n297\r\n\r\nits former condition of potential by no process of which we can\r\nhave any conception.\r\n\r\nOur speculation is that we, as spectators of evolution, are\r\nwitnessing the interaction of forces which have not always been\r\nacting. A prematerial state of the universe was one of unfruitful\r\nmotions, that is, motions unattended by progressing changes, in\r\nour region of the ether. How extended we cannot say; the nature\r\nof the motions we know not; but the kinetic entities differed\r\nfrom matter in the one important particular of not possessing\r\ngravitational attraction. Such kinetic configurations we cannot\r\nconsider to be matter. It was _possible_ to construct matter by\r\ntheir summation or linkage as the configuration of the crystal is\r\npossible in the clear supersaturated liquid.\r\n\r\nDuration in an ether filled with such motions would pass in a\r\nsuccession of mere unfruitful events; as duration, we may\r\nimagine, even now passes in parts of the ether similar to our\r\nown. An endless (it may be) succession of unprogressive,\r\nfruitless events. But at one moment in the infinite duration the\r\nrequisite configuration of the elementary motions is attained;\r\nsolely by the one chance disposition the stability of all must\r\ngo, spreading from the fateful point.\r\n\r\nPossibly the material segregation was confined to one part of\r\nspace, the elementary motions condensing upon transformation, and\r\nso impoverishing the ether around till the action ceased. Again\r\nin the same sense as the\r\n\r\n298\r\n\r\nstars are simultaneous, so also they may be regarded as uniform\r\nin size, for the difference in magnitude might have been anything\r\nwe please to imagine, if at the same time we ascribe sufficient\r\ndistance sundering great and small. So, too;, will a dilute\r\nsolution of acetate of soda build a crystal at one point, and the\r\nimpoverishment of the medium checking the growth in this region,\r\nanother centre will begin at the furthest extremities of the\r\nfirst crystal till the liquid is filled with loose feathery\r\naggregations comparable in size with one another. In a similar\r\nway the crystallizing out of matter may have given rise, not to a\r\nuniform nebula in space, but to detached nebula, approximately of\r\nequal mass, from which ultimately were formed the stars.\r\n\r\nThat an all-knowing Being might have foretold the ultimate event\r\nat any preceding period by observing the motions of the parts\r\nthen occurring, and reasoning as to the train of consequences\r\narising from these nations, is supposable. But considerations\r\narising from this involve no difficulty in ascribing to this\r\nprematerial train of events infinite duration. For progress there\r\nis none, and we can quite as easily conceive of some part of\r\nspace where the same Infinite Intelligence, contemplating a\r\nsimilar train of unfruitful motions, finds that at no time in the\r\nfuture will the equilibrium be disturbed. But where evolution is\r\nprogressing this is no longer conceivable, as being contradictory\r\nto the very idea of progressive development. In this case\r\nInfinite Intelligence\r\n\r\n299\r\n\r\n_necessarily_ finds, as the result of his contemplation, the\r\naggregation of matter, and the consequences arising therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe negation of so primary a material property as gravitation to\r\nthese primitive motions of (or in) the ether, probably involves\r\nthe negation of many properties we find associated with matter.\r\nPossibly the quality of inertia, equally primary, is involved\r\nwith that of gravitation, and we may suppose that these two\r\nproperties so intimately associated in determining the motions of\r\nbodies in space were conferred upon the primitive motions as\r\ncrystallographic attraction and rigidity are first conferred upon\r\nthe solid growing from the supersaturated liquid. But in some\r\ndegree less speculative is the supposition that the new order of\r\nmotions involved the transformation of much energy into the form\r\nof heat vibrations; so that the newly generated matter, like the\r\nnewly formed crystal, began its existence in a medium richly fed\r\nwith thermal radiant energy. We may consider that the thermal\r\nconditions were such as would account for a primitive\r\ndissociation of the elements. And, again, we recall how the\r\nphysicist finds his estimate of the energy involved in mere\r\ngravitational aggregation inadequate to afford explanation of\r\npast solar heat. It is supposable, on such a hypothesis as we\r\nhave been dwelling on, that the entire subsequent gravitational\r\ncondensation and conversion of material potential energy, dating\r\nfrom the first formation of matter to the stage of star\r\nformation\r\n\r\n300\r\n\r\nmay be insignificant in amount compared with the conversion of\r\netherial energy attending the crystallizing out of matter from\r\nthe primitive motions. And thus possibly the conditions then\r\nobtaining involved a progressively increasing complexity of\r\nmaterial structure the genesis of the elements, from an\r\ninfra-hydrogen possessing the simplest material configuration,\r\nresulting ultimately in such self-luminous nebula as we yet see\r\nin the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe late James Croll, in his _Stellar Evolution_, finds objections\r\nto an eternal evolution, one of which is similar to the\r\n\"metaphysical\" objection urged in this paper. His way out of the\r\ndifficulty is in the speculation that our stellar system\r\noriginated by the collision of two masses endowed with relative\r\nmotion, eternal in past duration, their meeting ushering in the\r\ndawn of evolution. However, the state of aggregation here\r\nassumed, from the known laws of matter and from analogy, calls\r\nfor explanation as probably the result of prior diffusion, when,\r\nof course, the difficulty is only put back, not set at rest. Nor\r\ndo I think the primitive collision in harmony with the number of\r\nrelatively stationary nebula visible in space.\r\n\r\nThe metaphysical objection is, I find, also urged by George\r\nSalmon, late Provost of Trinity College, in favour of the\r\ncreation of the universe.--(_Sermons on Agnosticism_.)\r\n\r\nA. Winchell, in _World Life_, says: \"We have not\r\n\r\n301\r\n\r\nthe slightest scientific grounds for assuming that matter existed\r\nin a certain condition from all eternity. The essential activity\r\nof the powers ascribed to it forbids the thought; for all that we\r\nknow, and, indeed, as the _conclusion_ from all that we know,\r\nprimal matter began its progressive changes on the morning of its\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in reference to the hypothesis of a unique determination\r\nof matter after eternal duration in the past, it may not be out\r\nof place to remind the reader of the complexity which modern\r\nresearch ascribes to the structure of the atom.\r\n\r\n302\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAbney, Sir Wm., on sensitisers, 210.\r\n\r\nAbundance of life, numerical, 98-100.\r\n\r\nAdaptation and aggressiveness of the organism, 80.\r\n\r\nAdditive law, the, with reference to alpha rays, 220.\r\n\r\nAge of Earth, comparison of denudative and radioactive methods of\r\nfinding, 23-29.\r\n\r\nAletsch glacier, 286.\r\n\r\nAllen, Grant, on colour of Alpine plants, 104.\r\n\r\nAllen, H.
