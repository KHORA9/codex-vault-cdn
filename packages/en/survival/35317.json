GEOLOGICAL SURVEY; AUTHOR OF\r\n    'THE GREAT ICE AGE.'\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Logo]\r\n\r\n    W. & R. CHAMBERS\r\n    LONDON AND EDINBURGH\r\n    1883\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Edinburgh:\r\n    Printed by W. and R. Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vital importance of diffusing some knowledge of the leading\r\nprinciples of Science among all classes of society, is becoming daily\r\nmore widely and deeply felt; and to meet and promote this important\r\nmovement, W. & R. CHAMBERS have resolved on issuing the present Series\r\nof ELEMENTARY SCIENCE MANUALS. The Editors believe that they enjoy\r\nspecial facilities for the successful execution of such an undertaking,\r\nowing to their long experience--now extending over a period of forty\r\nyears--in the work of popular education, as well as to their having the\r\nco-operation of writers specially qualified to treat the several\r\nsubjects. In particular, they are happy in having the editorial\r\nassistance of ANDREW FINDLATER, LL.D., to whose labours they were so\r\nmuch indebted in the work of editing and preparing _Chamber's\r\nEncyclopaedia_.\r\n\r\nThe Manuals of this series are intended to serve two somewhat different\r\npurposes:\r\n\r\n1. They are designed, in the first place, for SELF-INSTRUCTION, and will\r\npresent, in a form suitable for private study, the main subjects\r\nentering into an enlightened education; so that young persons in earnest\r\nabout self-culture may be able to master them for themselves.\r\n\r\n2. The other purpose of the Manuals is, to serve as TEXT-BOOKS IN\r\nSCHOOLS. The mode of treatment naturally adopted in what is to be\r\nstudied without a teacher, so far from being a drawback in a\r\nschool-manual, will, it is believed, be a positive advantage. Instead of\r\na number of abrupt statements being presented, to be taken on trust and\r\nlearned, as has been the usual method in school-teaching; the subject is\r\nmade, as far as possible, to unfold itself gradually, as if the pupil\r\nwere discovering the principles himself, the chief function of the book\r\nbeing, to bring the materials before him, and to guide him by the\r\nshortest road to the discovery. This is now acknowledged to be the only\r\nprofitable method of acquiring knowledge, whether as regards\r\nself-instruction or learning at school.\r\n\r\nFor simplification in teaching, the subject has been divided into\r\nsub-sections or articles, which are numbered continuously; and a series\r\nof Questions, in corresponding divisions, has been appended. These\r\nQuestions, while they will enable the private student to test for\r\nhimself how far he has mastered the several parts of the subject as he\r\nproceeds, will serve the teacher of a class as specimens of the more\r\ndetailed and varied examination to which he should subject his pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE BY THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nIn the present Manual of GEOLOGY it has been the aim of the author\r\nrather to indicate the methods of geological inquiry and reasoning, than\r\nto present the learner with a tedious summary of results. Attention has\r\ntherefore been directed chiefly to the physical branches of the\r\nscience--Palaeontology and Historical Geology, which are very large\r\nsubjects of themselves, having been only lightly touched upon. The\r\nstudent who has attained to a fair knowledge of the scope and bearing of\r\nPhysical Geology, should have little difficulty in subsequently tackling\r\nthose manuals in which the results obtained by geological investigation\r\nare specially treated of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTORY                                                       7\r\n\r\n  CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS                                            8\r\n\r\n  MINERALOGY                                                        12\r\n      ROCK-FORMING MINERALS                                         14\r\n\r\n  PETROLOGY--\r\n      MECHANICALLY FORMED ROCKS                                     17\r\n      CHEMICALLY FORMED ROCKS                                       19\r\n      ORGANICALLY DERIVED ROCKS                                     20\r\n      METAMORPHIC ROCKS                                             21\r\n      IGNEOUS ROCKS                                                 23\r\n      STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF ROCK-MASSES--\r\n          Stratification, &c.; Mud-cracks and Rain-prints;\r\n          Succession of Strata; Extent of Beds; Sequence of\r\n          Beds--Joints; Cleavage; Foliation; Concretions;\r\n          Inclination of Strata; Contemporaneous Erosion;\r\n          Unconformability; Overlap; Faults; Mode of\r\n          Occurrence of Metamorphic and Igneous Rocks;\r\n          Mineral Veins                                          26-46\r\n\r\n  DYNAMICAL GEOLOGY--\r\n      THE ATMOSPHERE AS A GEOLOGICAL AGENT OF CHANGE                46\r\n      WATER AS A GEOLOGICAL AGENT OF CHANGE                         48\r\n      GEOLOGICAL ACTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS                       60\r\n      SUBTERRANEAN FORCES                                           64\r\n      METAMORPHISM                                                  72\r\n\r\n  PHYSIOGRAPHY                                                      74\r\n\r\n  PALAEONTOLOGY                                                      77\r\n\r\n  HISTORICAL GEOLOGY                                                84\r\n\r\n  QUESTIONS                                                         89\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GEOLOGY]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Definition._--Geology is the science of the origin and development\r\nof the structure of the earth. It treats of the nature and mode of\r\nformation of the various materials of which the earth's crust is\r\ncomposed; it seeks to discover what mutations of land and water, and\r\nwhat changes of climate, have supervened during the past; it endeavours\r\nto trace the history of the multitudinous tribes of plants and animals\r\nwhich have successively tenanted our globe. In a word, Geology is the\r\nPhysical Geography of past ages.\r\n\r\n2. _Rocks._--Every one knows that the crust of the earth is composed of\r\nvery various substances, some of which are hard and crystalline in\r\ntexture, like granite; others less indurated and non-crystalline, such\r\nas sandstone, chalk, shale, &c.; while yet others are more or less soft\r\nand incoherent masses, as gravel, sand, clay, peat, &c. Now, all these\r\nheterogeneous materials, whether they be hard or soft, compact or loose,\r\ngranular or crystalline, are termed _rocks_. Blowing sand-dunes,\r\nalluvial silt and sand, and even peat, are, geologically speaking,\r\nrocks, just as much as basalt or any indurated building-stone. The\r\nvariety of rocks is very great, but we do not study these long before we\r\nbecome aware that many kinds which present numerous contrasts in detail,\r\nyet possess certain characters in common. And this not only groups these\r\ndiverse species together, but serves also to distinguish them from other\r\nspecies of rock, which in like manner are characterised by the presence\r\nof some prevalent generic feature or features.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Rocks._--All the rocks that we know of are thus\r\ncapable of being arranged under _five_ classes, as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. MECHANICALLY FORMED.\r\n   II. CHEMICALLY FORMED.\r\n  III. ORGANICALLY DERIVED.\r\n   IV. METAMORPHIC.\r\n    V. IGNEOUS.\r\n\r\n3. The MECHANICALLY FORMED class comprises a considerable variety of\r\nrocks, all of which, however, come under only two subdivisions--namely,\r\n_Sedimentary_, and _Eolian_ or _Aerial_, the former being by far the\r\nmore important. Of the _Sedimentary_ group, there are three rocks which\r\nmay be taken as typical and representative--namely, _conglomerate_ or\r\n_puddingstone_, _sandstone_, and _shale_. A short examination of the\r\nnature of these will sufficiently explain why they come to be grouped\r\ntogether under one head. _Conglomerate_ consists of a mass of\r\nvarious-sized rounded stones cemented together; each stone has been well\r\nrubbed, and rolled, and rounded. It is quite obvious that the now solid\r\nrock must at one time have existed in a loose and unconsolidated state,\r\nlike gravel and shingle. Nor can we resist the conclusion that the\r\nstones were at one time rolled about by the action of water--that being\r\nthe only mode in which gravel-stones are shaped. Again, when we have an\r\nopportunity of examining any considerable vertical thickness of\r\nconglomerate, we shall frequently observe that the stones are arranged\r\nmore or less definitely along certain lines. These, there can be no\r\nquestion, are _lines of deposition_--the rounded stones have evidently\r\nnot been formed and accumulated all at once, but piled up gradually,\r\nlayer upon layer. And since there is no force in nature, that we know\r\nof, save water in motion, that could so round and smooth stones, and\r\nspread them out in successive layers or beds, we may now amplify our\r\ndefinition of conglomerate, and describe it as a _compacted mass of\r\nstones which have been more or less rounded, and arranged in more or\r\nless distinct layers or beds, by the action of water_.\r\n\r\n4. _Sandstone_ may at the outset be described as a _granular\r\nnon-crystalline rock_. This rock shews every degree of coarseness, from\r\na mass in which the constituent grains are nearly as large as\r\nturnip-seed, down to a stone so fine in the grain that we need a lens to\r\ndiscover what the particles are of which it is composed. When these\r\nlatter are examined, they are found to exhibit marks of attrition, just\r\nlike the stones of a conglomerate. Sharp edges have been worn off, and\r\nthe grains rounded and rubbed; and whereas lines of deposition are often\r\nobscure, and of infrequent occurrence in conglomerate--in sandstone, on\r\nthe contrary, they are usually well marked and often abundant. We can\r\nhardly doubt, therefore, that sandstone has also had an _aqueous_\r\norigin, or in other words, that it has been formed and accumulated by\r\nthe force of water in motion. In short, sandstone is merely compacted\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n5. If it be easy to read the origin of conglomerate and sand in the\r\nexternal character of their ingredients, and the mode in which these\r\nhave been arranged, we shall find it not less easy to discover the\r\norigin of _shale_. Shale is, like sandstone, a granular non-crystalline\r\nrock. The particles of which it is built up are usually too small to be\r\ndistinguished without the aid of a lens, but when put under a sufficient\r\nmagnifying power, they exhibit evident marks of attrition. In structure\r\nit differs widely from sandstone. In the latter rock the layers of\r\ndeposition, though frequently numerous, are yet separated from each\r\nother by some considerable distance, it may be by a few inches or by\r\nmany yards. But in shale the layers are so thin that we may split the\r\nrock into _laminae_ or plates. Now we know that many sedimentary\r\nmaterials of recent origin, such as the silt of lakes, rivers, and\r\nestuaries, although when newly dug into they appear to be more or less\r\nhomogeneous, and shew but few lines of deposition, yet when exposed to\r\nthe action of the atmosphere and dried, they very often split up into\r\nlayers exhibiting division planes as minute as any observable in shale.\r\nThere is no reason to doubt, therefore, that shale is merely compacted\r\nsilt and mud--the sediment deposited by water. It becomes evident,\r\ntherefore, that conglomerate, sandstone, and shale are terms of one\r\nseries. They are all equally sedimentary deposits, and thus, if we\r\nslightly modify our definition of conglomerate, we shall have a\r\ndefinition which will include the three rocks we have been considering.\r\nFor they may all be described as _granular non-crystalline rocks, the\r\nconstituent ingredients of which have been more or less rounded, and\r\narranged in more or less distinct layers, by the action of water_.\r\n\r\n6. The _Eolian_ or _Aerial_ group of rocks embraces all natural\r\naccumulations of organic or inorganic materials, which have been formed\r\nupon the land. The group is typically represented by _debris_, such as\r\ngathers on hill-slopes and at the base of cliffs, by the _sand-hills_ of\r\ndeserts and maritime districts, and by _soil_. All these accumulations\r\nowe their origin to atmospheric agencies, as will be more particularly\r\ndescribed in the sequel. As the _Sedimentary_ and _Eolian_ rocks are the\r\nresults of the _mechanical_ action of water and the atmosphere, they are\r\nfitly arranged under one great class--the MECHANICALLY FORMED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n7. CHEMICALLY FORMED ROCKS constitute another well-marked class, of\r\nwhich we may take _rock-salt_ as a typical example. This rock has\r\nevidently been deposited in water, but not in the manner of a\r\nsedimentary bed. It is not built up of water-worn particles which have\r\nbeen rolled about and accumulated layer upon layer, but has been slowly\r\nprecipitated during the gradual evaporation of water in which it was\r\npreviously held in solution. Its formation is therefore a chemical\r\nprocess. Various other rocks come under the same category, as we shall\r\nafterwards point out.\r\n\r\n8. The ORGANICALLY DERIVED class comprises a number of the most\r\nimportant and useful rock-masses. _Chalk_ may be selected as a typical\r\nexample. Even a slight examination shews that this rock differs widely\r\nfrom any of those mentioned above. Conglomerate, sandstone, shale, &c.\r\nare built up of pebbles, particles, grains, &c. of various inorganic\r\nmaterials. But chalk, when looked at under the microscope, betrays an\r\norganic origin. It consists, chiefly, of the hard calcareous parts of\r\nanimal organisms, and is more or less abundantly stocked with the\r\nremains of corals, shells, crustaceans, &c. in every degree of\r\npreservation; indeed, so abundant are these relics, that they go to form\r\na great proportion of the rock. _Coal_ is another familiar example of an\r\norganically derived rock, since it consists entirely of vegetable\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n9. The METAMORPHIC class, as the name implies, embraces all those rocks\r\nwhich have undergone some decided change since the time of their\r\nformation. This change generally consists in a re-arrangement of their\r\nconstituent elements, and has frequently resulted in giving a\r\ncrystalline texture to the rocks affected. Hence certain sedimentary\r\ndeposits like sandstone and shale have been changed from granular into\r\ncrystalline rocks, and the like has happened to beds of limestone and\r\nchalk. _Mica-schist, gneiss_, and _saccharoid marble_ are typical of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n10. The IGNEOUS rocks are those which owe their origin to the action of\r\nthe internal forces of the earth's crust. Most of them have been in a\r\nstate of fusion, and betray their origin by their crystalline and\r\nsometimes glassy texture, and also, as we shall see in another section,\r\nby the mode of their occurrence. _Lava_, _basalt_, and _obsidian_ are\r\ncharacteristic types of this group of igneous rocks. Another group\r\nembraces a large variety of igneous rocks which are non-crystalline, and\r\nvary in texture from fine-grained, almost compact, bedded masses, like\r\ncertain varieties of _tuff_, up to coarse, irregular accumulations of\r\nangular stones imbedded in a fine-grained or gritty matrix, like\r\n_volcanic breccia_ and _volcanic agglomerate_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Having learned that all the rocks met with at the surface of the\r\nearth's crust are capable of being arranged under a few classes, we have\r\nnow to investigate the matter more in detail. It will be observed that\r\nthe classification adopted above is based chiefly upon the external\r\ncharacters of the constituent ingredients of the rocks, and the mode in\r\nwhich these particles have been collected. In some rocks the component\r\nmaterials are crystalline, in others they are rounded and worn; in one\r\ncase they have been brought together by precipitation from an aqueous\r\nsolution, or they have crystallised out from a mass of once molten\r\nmatter; in another case their collection and intimate association is due\r\nto the mechanical action of the atmosphere or of water, or to the agency\r\nof the organic forces. We have next to inquire what is the nature of\r\nthose crystals and particles which are the ingredients of the rocks?\r\nThe answer to this question properly belongs to the science of\r\nmineralogy, with which, however, the geologist must necessarily make\r\nsome acquaintance.\r\n\r\n12. _Granite--its composition._--It will tend to simplify matters if we\r\nbegin our inquiry by selecting for examination some familiar rock, such\r\nas _granite_. This rock, as one sees at a glance, is crystalline, nor is\r\nit difficult to perceive that three separate kinds of ingredients go to\r\ncompose it. One of these we shall observe is a gray, or it may be, clear\r\nglassy-looking substance, which is hard, and will not scratch with a\r\nknife; another is of a pink, red, gray, or sometimes even pale green\r\ncolour, and scratches with difficulty; while the third shews a\r\nglistering metallic lustre, and is generally of a brownish or black\r\ncolour. It scratches easily with the knife, and can be split up into\r\nflakes of extreme thinness. If the granite be one of the coarse-grained\r\nvarieties, we shall notice that these three ingredients have each more\r\nor less definite crystalline forms; so that they are not distinguished\r\nby colour and hardness alone. The metallic-looking substance is _mica_;\r\nthe hard gray, or glassy and unscratchable ingredient is _quartz_; and\r\nthe remaining material is _felspar_. The mineralogist's analysis of\r\ngranite ends here. But there is still much to be learned about quartz,\r\nfelspar, and mica; for, as the chemist will tell us, these are not\r\n'elementary substances.' Quartz is a compound, consisting of two\r\nelements, one of which is a non-metallic body (silicon), and the other\r\nan invisible gas (oxygen). Felspar[A] is a still more complex compound,\r\nbeing made up of two metals (potassium, aluminium) and one non-metallic\r\nbody (silicon), each of which is united to an invisible gas (oxygen).\r\nMica, again, contains no fewer than four metals (potassium, magnesium,\r\niron, calcium) and one non-metallic body (silicon), each of which is in\r\nlike manner chemically united to its share of oxygen. Thus the\r\nrock-forming substances, quartz, felspar, and mica, have each a definite\r\nchemical composition.\r\n\r\n13. _Minerals._--Now, any inorganic substance which has a definite\r\nchemical composition, and crystallises in a definite crystalline or\r\ngeometric form, is termed a _mineral_. Having once discovered that\r\nquartz is composed of silicon and oxygen--that is, silica--and that the\r\nfaces of its crystals are arranged in a certain definite order, we may\r\nbe quite sure that any mineral which has not this composition and form\r\ncannot be quartz. And so on with mica and felspar, and every other\r\nmineral. The study of the geometric forms assumed by minerals\r\n(crystallography) forms a department of the science of mineralogy. But,\r\nin the great majority of cases, the mineral ingredients of the rocks are\r\neither so small individually, or so broken, and rounded, and altered,\r\nthat crystallography gives comparatively little aid to the practical\r\ngeologist in the field. He has, therefore, recourse to other tests for\r\nthe determination of the mineral constituents of rocks. Many of these\r\ntests, however, can only be applied by those who have had long\r\nexperience. The simplest and easiest way for the student to begin is to\r\nexamine the forms and appearance of the more common minerals in some\r\ncollection, and thereafter to accustom his eye to the aspect presented\r\nby the same minerals when they are associated together in rocks, of\r\nwhich illustrative specimens are now to be met with in most museums. The\r\nmicroscope is largely employed by geologists for determining the\r\nmineralogical composition of certain rocks; and, indeed, many rocks can\r\nhardly be said to be thoroughly known until they have been sliced and\r\nexamined under the microscope, and analysed by the chemist. But with a\r\nvast number such minute examination is not required, the eye after some\r\npractice being able to detect all that is needful to be known.\r\n\r\n   [A] There are various kinds of felspar; the one referred to above is\r\n       _orthoclase_, or potash-felspar.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCK-FORMING MINERALS.\r\n\r\n14. Nearly all the minerals we know of contain oxygen as a necessary\r\ningredient, there being only a very few minerals in which that gas does\r\nnot occur in chemical union with other elements. Three of these\r\nminerals, _sulphur_, the _diamond_, and _graphite_, consist of simple\r\nsubstances, and are of great commercial importance, but none of them is\r\nof so frequent occurrence, as a rock constituent, as the minerals\r\npresently to be described. _Sulphur_ occurs sometimes in thin beds, but\r\nmore frequently in small nests and nodules, &c. in other rocks, or in\r\njoints, and fissures, and veins. It is frequently found in volcanic\r\ndistricts. The _diamond_, which consists of pure _carbon_, is generally\r\nmet with in alluvial deposits, but sometimes, also, in a curious\r\nflexible sandstone, called _itacolumite_. _Graphite_ is another form of\r\ncarbon. It occurs both in a crystalline and amorphous form, the latter,\r\nor non-crystalline kind, being extensively used for lead-pencils.\r\n_Rock-salt_ is a _chloride of sodium_, and appears sometimes in masses\r\nof a hundred feet and more in thickness. Another mineral which contains\r\nno oxygen is the well-known _fluor-spar_. It occurs chiefly in veins,\r\nand is often associated with ores. With these, and a few other\r\nexceptions, all the minerals hitherto discovered contain oxygen as an\r\nessential element; and so large is the proportion of this gas which\r\nenters into union with other elements to constitute the various minerals\r\nof which the rocks are composed, that it forms at least one-half of all\r\nthe ponderable matter near the earth's surface. When the student learns\r\nthat there are probably no fewer than six or seven hundred different\r\nminerals, he will understand how impossible it is to do more in a short\r\ngeological treatise than point out a few of the most commonly occurring\r\nones. And, indeed, a knowledge of the chief rock-forming minerals, which\r\nare few in number, is all that is absolutely requisite for geological\r\npurposes. Some of these we accordingly proceed to name.[B]\r\n\r\n   [B] It is needless to describe the minerals minutely here. The\r\n       student can only learn to distinguish the different species\r\n       by carefully examining actual specimens.\r\n\r\n15. _Quartz._--This mineral has already been partially described. It is\r\nthe most abundant of all the rock-forming minerals, and occurs in three\r\nforms: (1) _crystallised quartz_ or _rock crystal_; (2) _chalcedony_,\r\nboth of which are composed of silica--that is, silicon and oxygen; and\r\n(3) _hydrated quartz_--that is, silica with the addition of water.\r\n\r\n_Hematite._--This is an oxide of iron. It occurs in mammillary rounded\r\nmasses, with a fibrous structure, and a dull metallic lustre.\r\n_Magnetite_ or magnetic iron ore, _specular iron_, and _limonite_ are\r\nalso oxides of iron. _Hematite_ shews a red streak when scratched with a\r\nknife, which distinguishes it from magnetite.\r\n\r\n_Iron pyrites._--This is a sulphide of iron of very common occurrence.\r\nIts crystalline form is cubical. When broken, it emits a sulphurous\r\nsmell. The brass-yellow coloured cubes so often seen in roofing-slates\r\nare familiar examples of the mode of its occurrence. But it is also\r\nfrequently found in masses having a crystalline surface.\r\n\r\n16. SULPHATES.--Only two sulphates may be noticed--namely, _gypsum_,\r\nwhich is a sulphate of lime, with its varieties, _selenite_,\r\n_satin-spar_, and _alabaster_; and _barytes_, a sulphate of baryta.\r\n_Barytes_ scratches easily with the knife, and from its great specific\r\ngravity is often called _heavy-spar_. Gypsum is softer than barytes.\r\n\r\nCARBONATES.--Two of these only need be mentioned: _calcite_ or\r\n_calc-spar_, a carbonate of lime, which scratches with the knife, and\r\neffervesces readily with dilute hydrochloric acid; and _arragonite_,\r\nalso a carbonate of lime, but denser than calcite.\r\n\r\nSILICATES.--These are by far the most abundantly occurring minerals. The\r\nspecies are also exceedingly numerous, but we may note here only a few\r\nof the more important. They are composed of silica and various bases,\r\nsuch as lime, potash, magnesia, soda, alumina, &c. _Augite_ or\r\n_pyroxene_ is a black or greenish-black mineral, found, either as\r\ncrystals, which are generally small, or as rounded grains and angular\r\nfragments, in basaltic and volcanic rocks. It never occurs in granite\r\nrocks. It is brittle, and has a vitreous or resinous lustre. There are a\r\nnumber of varieties or sub-species of augite. _Hornblende_, like augite,\r\nalso includes a great many minerals. When the crystals are small, it is\r\noften difficult to distinguish hornblende from augite. Common hornblende\r\noccurs crystallised or massive, and is dark green or black, with a\r\nvitreous lustre. It is generally sub-translucent. It usually\r\ncrystallises in igneous rocks which contain much quartz or silica; while\r\naugite, on the other hand, crystallises in igneous rocks which are of a\r\nmore basic character--that is to say, rocks in which silica is not so\r\nabundantly present. _Felspar_ is a generic term which embraces a number\r\nof species, such as _orthoclase_ or _potash-felspar_, _albite_ or\r\n_soda-felspar_, and _anorthite_ or _lime-felspar_. _Orthoclase_ is\r\nwhite, red or pink, and gray. It is one of the ordinary constituents of\r\ngranite, and enters into the composition of many rocks. _Albite_ is\r\nusually white. It often occurs as a constituent of granite, not\r\nunfrequently being associated in the same rock with pink felspar or\r\northoclase. In syenite and greenstone it occurs more commonly than\r\northoclase. _Anorthite_ occurs in white translucent or transparent\r\ncrystals. It is not so common a constituent of rocks as either of the\r\nother felspars just referred to. _Mica_: this term includes several\r\nminerals, which all agree in being highly cleavable into thin elastic\r\nflakes or laminae, which have a glistening metallic lustre. Mica is one\r\nof the common constituents of granite. _Talc_ is a silvery white,\r\ngrayish, pale or dark-green coloured mineral, with a pearly lustre. It\r\nsplits readily into thin flakes, which are flexible, but not elastic,\r\nand may be readily scratched with the nail. It is unctuous and greasy to\r\nthe touch. It occurs in beds (_talc-slate_), and is often met with in\r\ndistricts occupied by metamorphic crystalline rocks. _Serpentine_ is\r\ngenerally of a green colour, but brown, red, and variously mottled\r\nvarieties occur. It has a dull lustre, and is soft, and easily cut; it\r\nis tough, however, and takes on a good polish. It forms rock-masses in\r\nsome places. The finer varieties are called _noble serpentine_.\r\n_Chlorite_ is another soft, easily scratched mineral, generally of a\r\ndark-green colour. It has a pearly lustre. Sometimes it occurs in beds\r\n(_chlorite-slate_), and is often found coating the walls of fissures in\r\ncertain rocks. It has a somewhat greasy feel. The three last-mentioned\r\nminerals--talc, serpentine, and chlorite--are all silicates of magnesia.\r\n_Zeolites_ is a term which comprises a number of minerals of varying\r\nchemical composition, all of which tend to form a jelly when treated\r\nwith acids. When heated by the blow-pipe they bubble up, owing to the\r\nescape of water; hence their name _zeolites_, from _zeo_, I boil, and\r\n_lithos_, a stone. The zeolites occur very commonly in cavities in\r\nigneous rocks, and also in mineral veins.\r\n\r\nHaving now mentioned the chief rock-forming minerals, we proceed to a\r\nbrief description of some of the more typical representatives of the\r\nfive great classes of rocks referred to at page 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLOGY.[C]\r\n\r\n   [C] _Petros_, a rock, and _logos_, a discourse. Some geologists\r\n       restrict this term to the study of the _structure_ and\r\n       _arrangement of rock-masses_, and apply the term _lithology_\r\n       (_lithos_, a stone, and _logos_, a discourse) to the study of\r\n       the _mineralogical composition of rocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICALLY FORMED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n17. (_A._) SEDIMENTARY CLASS.--Three of the most commonly occurring\r\nrocks of this class have already been described, but a few details are\r\nadded here.\r\n\r\n_Conglomerate._--This is a consolidated mass of more or less water-worn\r\nand rounded stones. These stones may be of any size. When they are very\r\nlarge, the rock is called a _coarse conglomerate_; the finer varieties,\r\nin which the stones are small, are known as _pebbly conglomerates_. The\r\ningredients of a conglomerate may consist of any kind of rock, or of a\r\nmixture of many different kinds. When they consist entirely of quartz,\r\nthe rock becomes _quartzose_. The finer-grained conglomerates usually\r\nshew lines of deposition or bedding, but in some of the coarser sorts it\r\nis often difficult to detect any kind of arrangement. The stones are\r\nusually imbedded in a matrix of quartzose grit and sand, but sometimes\r\nthis is very scanty. When the nature of the material which binds the\r\nstones together is very well marked, the rock becomes _ferruginous_,\r\n_calcareous_, _arenaceous_, or _argillaceous_, according as the binding\r\nor cementing material is _iron_, _lime_, _sand_, or _clay_. _Breccia_ is\r\na rock in which the included fragments are _angular_.\r\n\r\n18. _Sandstone_ is, as already remarked, merely consolidated sand. The\r\ncoarser varieties, in which the grains are as large and larger than\r\nturnip-seeds, are termed _grit_. From these coarse varieties the rock\r\npasses insensibly, in one direction, into a fine or pebbly conglomerate,\r\nand in another into a rock, so fine-grained that a lens is needed to\r\ndistinguish the component particles. Quartz is the prevailing\r\ningredient--sometimes clear, at other times white. Frequently, however,\r\nthe grains are coated with an oxide of iron, which gives the resulting\r\nrock a red colour. The other colours assumed by sandstone--such as\r\nyellow, brown, green, &c.--are also in like manner due to the presence\r\nof some compound of iron. When mica or felspar occurs plentifully, we\r\nhave, in the one case, _micaceous sandstone_, and in the other\r\n_felspathic sandstone_. A sandstone in which the grains are cemented by\r\ncarbonate of lime is said to be _calcareous_. _Freestone_ is a sandstone\r\nwhich can be worked freely in any direction. In most sandstones, the\r\nlines of bedding are distinct; when they are so numerous as to render\r\nthe rock fissile, the sandstone is said to be _shaly_.\r\n\r\n_Shale_ is a more or less indurated fissile or laminated clay. When the\r\nrock becomes coarse by the admixture of sand, it gradually passes into a\r\n_shaly sandstone_. There are many other varieties of clay-rocks--such as\r\n_fire-clay_, _pipe-clay_, _marl_, _loam_, &c.--which are sufficiently\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n19. (_B._) EOLIAN or AERIAL CLASS.--_Blown-sand_ is found at many places\r\non sea-coasts. It generally forms smooth rounded hummocks, which are\r\nsometimes arranged in long lines parallel to the trend of the coast, as,\r\nfor example, in the Tents Moor, near St Andrews. The _sand-hills_ of\r\ndeserts also belong to this class.\r\n\r\n_Debris_ is the loose angular rubbish which collects at the base of\r\ncliffs, on hill-tops, and hill-slopes. Immense accumulations of it occur\r\nin lofty mountainous districts and in arctic regions. In Nova Zembla,\r\nfor example, the solid rock of the country is almost concealed beneath a\r\nthick covering of debris. But the various kinds of debris will be more\r\nparticularly described further on.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--An account of this can hardly be given without entering into\r\nthe theory of its origin, and therefore we reserve its consideration for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICALLY FORMED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n20. _Stalactites_ and _stalagmites_ are carbonates of lime. They vary\r\nin colour, being white, or yellow, or brown. Stalactites are usually\r\nfound adhering to the roofs of limestone caverns, &c., or depending from\r\nlimestone rocks; stalagmites, on the other hand, commonly occur on the\r\nfloors of limestone caverns, where they often attain a thickness of many\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_Siliceous sinter_ is silica with the addition of water--in other words,\r\na hydrated quartz. It is not a very abundant rock, and is found chiefly\r\nin volcanic countries.\r\n\r\n_Rock-salt_ has already been described. It occurs either as thin beds,\r\nor in the form of thick cake-like masses, often reaching ninety or one\r\nhundred feet in thickness. It is rudely crystalline in texture, and is\r\nusually discoloured brown and red with various impurities.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANICALLY DERIVED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n21. _Limestone_ consists of carbonate of lime, but usually contains some\r\nimpurities. The varieties of this rock are numerous; some of them are as\r\nfollows: _Chalk_; _oolite_, a rock built up of little spheroidal\r\nconcretions, whence its name, _egg_ or _roe stone_ (the coarser oolites\r\nare called _pisolite_, or _pea-stone_); _lacustrine limestone_, &c. When\r\nmuch silica is diffused through the rock, we have a _siliceous\r\nlimestone_; the presence of clay and of carbonaceous matter gives us\r\n_argillaceous_ and _carbonaceous limestones_. _Cornstone_ is a limestone\r\ncontaining a large quantity of arenaceous matter or sand. Many\r\nlimestones are distinguished by the different kinds of organic remains\r\nwhich they yield. Thus, we have _muschelkalk_ or _shell-limestone_,\r\n_nummulitic_, _crinoidal_, &c. limestone. The crystalline limestones,\r\nsuch as _statuary marble_, are metamorphosed limestones. Not a few\r\nlimestones are chemically formed rocks, and many, also, are partly of\r\nchemical and partly of organic origin, so that no hard and fast line can\r\nbe drawn between these two classes of rock.\r\n\r\n_Dolomite_, or _magnesian limestone_.--This is a compound of carbonate\r\nof lime and carbonate of magnesia. Its colour is usually yellow, or\r\nyellowish brown, but gray and black varieties are sometimes met with. It\r\nis generally fine-grained, with a crystalline texture, and pearly\r\nlustre. It effervesces less freely with acids than pure limestone. In\r\nmany cases dolomite is merely a metamorphosed limestone.\r\n\r\n22. _Coal_ is composed of vegetable matter, but usually contains a\r\ngreater or less percentage of impurities. The varieties of this\r\nsubstance are very numerous, and differ from each other principally in\r\nregard to their bituminous or non-bituminous character. Coal is\r\nbituminous or non-bituminous according as it is less or more highly\r\nmineralised. Bitumen results from the decomposition of vegetable matter;\r\nbut, when the mineralising process (to which the formation of coal is\r\ndue) has proceeded far enough, the vegetable matter gradually loses its\r\nbituminous character, and the result is a non-bituminous coal. Varieties\r\nof coal are the following: _Lignite_ or _brown coal_; _caking coal_;\r\n_cannel_, _parrot_, or _gas coal_; _splint coal_; _cherry_ or _soft\r\ncoal_; _anthracite_ or _blind coal_, so called because it burns with no\r\nflame. _Peat_ may be mentioned as another natural fuel. It is composed\r\nof vegetable matter. In some kinds it is so far decomposed, or\r\nmineralised, that the eye does not detect vegetable fibres; when\r\nthoroughly dried, such peat breaks like a good lignite, and forms an\r\nexcellent fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n23. _Quartz-rock_, or _quartzite_, is an altered quartzose sandstone or\r\ngrit; it is generally a white or grayish-yellow rock, very hard and\r\ncompact. The original gritty character of the rock is distinct, but the\r\ngranules appear as if they had been fused so far as to become mutually\r\nadherent. When the altered sandstone has been composed of grains of\r\nquartz, felspar, or mica, set in a siliceous, felspathic, or\r\nargillaceous base, we get a rock called _greywacke_, which is usually\r\ngray or grayish blue in colour.\r\n\r\n24. _Clay-slate_ is a grayish blue, or green, fine-grained hard rock,\r\nwhich splits into numerous more or less thin laminae, which may or may\r\nnot coincide with the original bedding. Most usually the 'cleavage,' as\r\nthis fissile structure is termed, crosses the bedding at all angles.\r\n\r\n25. _Crystalline limestone_ is an altered condition of common limestone.\r\n_Saccharoid marble_ is one of the fine varieties: it frequently contains\r\nflakes of mica. _Dolomite_, or magnesian limestone, already described,\r\nis probably in many cases an altered limestone; the carbonate of lime\r\nhaving been partially dissolved out and replaced by carbonate of\r\nmagnesia. _Serpentine_ is also believed by some geologists to be a\r\nhighly metamorphosed magnesian limestone.\r\n\r\n26. _Schists_.--Under this term comes a great variety of crystalline\r\nrocks which all agree in having a foliated texture--that is to say, the\r\nconstituent minerals are arranged in layers which usually, but not\r\ninvariably, coincide with the original bedding. Amongst the schists come\r\n_mica-schist_ (quartz and mica in alternate layers); _chlorite-schist_\r\n(chlorite with a little quartz, and sometimes with felspar or mica);\r\n_talc-schist_ (talc with quartz or felspar); _hornblende schist_\r\n(hornblende with a variable quantity of felspar, and sometimes a little\r\nquartz); _gneiss_ (quartz, felspar, and mica).\r\n\r\n27. _General Character of Metamorphic Rocks._--All these rocks betray\r\ntheir aqueous origin by the presence of more or less distinct lines of\r\nbedding. They consist of various kinds of arenaceous and argillaceous\r\ndeposits, which, under the influence of certain metamorphic actions, to\r\nbe described in the sequel, have lost their original granular texture,\r\nand become more or less distinctly crystallised. And not only so, but\r\ntheir chemical ingredients have in many cases entered into new\r\nrelations, so as to give rise to minerals which existed either sparingly\r\nor not at all in the original rocks. Frequently, it is quite impossible\r\nto say what was the original condition of some metamorphic rocks; often,\r\nhowever, this is sufficiently obvious. Thus, highly micaceous\r\nsandstones, as they are traced into a metamorphic region, are seen to\r\npass gradually into mica-schist. When the bedding of gneiss becomes\r\nentirely obliterated, it is often difficult to distinguish that rock\r\nfrom granite, and in many cases it appears to pass into a true granite.\r\n\r\n28. _Granite_ is a crystalline compound of quartz, felspar (usually\r\npotash-felspar), and mica. Some geologists consider it to be invariably\r\nan igneous rock; but, as just stated, it sometimes passes into gneiss in\r\nsuch a way as to lead us to infer its metamorphic origin. There are\r\ncertain areas of sandstone in the south of Scotland which are partially\r\nmetamorphosed, and in these we may trace a gradual passage from highly\r\nbaked felspathic sandstones with a sub-crystalline texture into a more\r\ncrystalline rock which in places graduates into true granite. Granite,\r\nhowever, also occurs as an igneous rock.\r\n\r\n29. _Syenite_ is a crystalline compound of a potash-felspar and\r\nhornblende, and quartz is frequently present. _Diorite_ is a crystalline\r\naggregate of a soda-felspar and hornblende. Both syenite and diorite\r\nalso occur as igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other metamorphic rocks, but those mentioned are\r\nthe most commonly occurring species.\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n30. _Subdivisions._--In their chemical and mineralogical composition,\r\nigneous rocks offer great variety; but they all agree in having\r\nfelspar for their base. They may be roughly divided into two classes,\r\ndistinguished by the relative quantity of silica which they contain.\r\nThose in which the silica ranges from about 50 to 70 or 80 per cent.\r\nform what is termed the _acidic_ group; while those in which the\r\npercentage of silica is less constitute the _basic_ group of igneous\r\nrocks, so called because they contain a large proportion of the\r\nheavier bases, such as _magnesia_, _lime_, oxides of iron and\r\nmanganese, &c. Igneous rocks vary in texture from homogeneous,\r\ncompact, and finely crystalline masses up to coarsely crystalline\r\naggregates, in which the crystals may be more than an inch in\r\ndiameter. Sometimes they are dull and earthy in texture, at other\r\ntimes vesicular. When the vesicles are filled up with some mineral,\r\nthe rock is said to be _amygdaloidal_, from the almond shape assumed\r\nby the kernels filling the cavities. When single crystals of any\r\nmineral are scattered through a rock, so as to be readily\r\ndistinguished from the compact or crystalline base, the rock becomes\r\n_porphyritic_.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDIC OR FELSPATHIC GROUP.\r\n\r\n31. _Trachyte_ (_trachys_, rough) is a pale or dark-gray rock, harsh\r\nand rough to the touch, in which felspar is the predominant mineral. It\r\nis a common product of eruption in modern volcanoes.\r\n\r\n_Clinkstone_ or _phonolite_ is a greenish-gray, compact, felspathic\r\nrock, somewhat slaty or schistose, and weathers with a white crust. It\r\ngives a clear metallic sound under the hammer. It is a rock not met with\r\namong the older formations of the earth's crust, being confined to\r\nTertiary (see table, p. 85) or still more recent times.\r\n\r\n_Obsidian_ or _volcanic glass_ is usually black, brown, or green, and\r\nusually resembles a coarse bottle-glass. When it becomes vesicular, it\r\npasses gradually into the highly porous rock called _pumice_. It is\r\neminently a geologically modern volcanic rock.\r\n\r\n_Felstone_ is a reddish-gray, bluish, greenish, or yellowish, hard,\r\ncompact, flinty-looking rock, composed of potash-felspar and silica. It\r\nis generally splintery under the hammer. Some varieties are slaty, and\r\nare frequently mistaken for clinkstone, which they closely resemble.\r\nWhen the quartz in felstone is distinctly visible either as grains or\r\ncrystals, the rock passes into a _quartz-porphyry_.\r\n\r\n_Granite_ is recognised as an igneous as well as a metamorphic rock.\r\nSometimes the veins and dykes which proceed from or occur near a mass of\r\ngranite contain no mica--this kind of rock is called _elvan_ or\r\n_elvanite_.\r\n\r\n_Porphyrite_ or _felspathite_ includes a number of rocks which have a\r\nfelspathic base, through which felspar crystals are scattered more or\r\nless abundantly. Sometimes hornblende, or augite, or mica is present.\r\nThe colour is usually dark--some shade of blue, green, red, puce,\r\npurple, or brown--and the texture varies from compact and finely\r\ncrystalline up to coarsely crystalline. Porphyrites are usually\r\nporphyritic, and frequently amygdaloidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGITIC AND HORNBLENDIC OR BASIC GROUP.\r\n\r\n32. _Basalt_ is a dark or almost black compact homogeneous rock,\r\ncomposed of felspar and augite with magnetic iron. An olive-green\r\nmineral called _olivine_ is very frequently present. The coarser-grained\r\nbasalts are called _dolerite_. The columnar structure is not peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of basalt. Many basalts are not columnar, and not a few\r\ncolumnar rocks are not basalts.\r\n\r\n_Greenstone_ or _diorite_ is usually a dull greenish rock, sometimes\r\ngray, however, speckled with green. It is composed of soda-felspar and\r\nhornblende. The fine-grained compact greenstones are called _aphanite_.\r\n\r\n_Syenite_, like granite, is recognised as an igneous as well as a\r\nmetamorphic rock. There are several other rocks which come into the\r\nbasic group, but those mentioned are the more common and typical\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n33. _Fragmental Igneous Rocks._--All the igneous rocks briefly described\r\nabove are more or less distinctly crystalline in texture. There is a\r\nclass of igneous rocks, however, which do not present this character,\r\nbut when fine-grained are dull and earthy in texture, and frequently\r\nconsist merely of a rude agglomeration of rough angular fragments of\r\nvarious rocks. These form the FRAGMENTAL group of igneous rocks. The\r\nejectamenta of loose materials which are thrown out during a volcanic\r\neruption, consist in chief measure of fragments of lava, &c. of all\r\nsizes, from mere dust, sand, and grit, up to blocks of more than a ton\r\nin weight. These materials, as we shall afterwards see, are scattered\r\nround the orifice of eruption in more or less irregular beds. The terms\r\napplied to the varieties of ejectamenta found among modern volcanic\r\naccumulations, will be given and explained when we come to consider the\r\nnature of geological agencies. In the British Islands, and many other\r\nnon-volcanic regions, we find besides crystalline igneous rocks,\r\nabundant traces of loose ejectamenta, which clearly prove the former\r\npresence of volcanoes. These materials are sometimes quite\r\namorphous--that is to say, they shew no trace of water action--they have\r\nnot been spread out in layers, but consist of rude tumultuous\r\naccumulations of angular and subangular fragments of igneous rocks. Such\r\nmasses are termed _trappean agglomerate_ and _trappean breccia_. At\r\nother times, however, the ejectamenta give evidence of having been\r\narranged by the action of water, the materials having been sifted and\r\nspread out in more or less regular layers. What were formerly rude\r\nbreccias and agglomerates of angular stones now become _trappean\r\nconglomerates_--the stones having been rounded and water-worn--while the\r\nfine ingredients, the grit, and sand, and mud, form the rock called\r\n_trap tuff_. Fragmental rocks are often quite indurated--the matrix\r\nbeing as hard as the included stones. But as a rule they are less hard\r\nthan crystalline igneous rocks, and in many cases are loose and\r\ncrumbling. When a fragmental rock is composed chiefly of rocks belonging\r\nto the acidic group, we say it is _felspathic_. When augitic and\r\nhornblendic materials predominate, then other terms are used; as, for\r\nexample, _dolerite tuff_, _greenstone tuff_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENT OF ROCK-MASSES.\r\n\r\n34. The student can hardly learn much about the mineralogical\r\ncomposition of rocks, without at the same time acquiring some knowledge\r\nof the manner of their occurrence in nature. We have already briefly\r\ndescribed certain sedimentary rocks, such as conglomerate, sandstone,\r\nand shale, and have in some measure touched upon their structure as\r\nrock-masses. These rocks, as we have seen, are arranged in more or less\r\nthick layers or _beds_, which are piled one on the top of the other.\r\nRocks which are so arranged are said to be _stratified_, and are termed\r\n_strata_. We may also use the word _stratum_ as an occasional substitute\r\nfor _bed_. The planes of _bedding_ or _stratification_ are sometimes\r\nvery close together, in other cases they are wide apart. When the\r\nseparate beds are very thin, as in the case of shale, it is most usual\r\nto term them _laminae_, and to speak of the _lamination_ of a shale, as\r\ndistinguished from the _bedding_ of a sandstone. Planes of bedding are\r\ngenerally more strongly marked than planes of lamination. The laminae\r\nfrequently cohere, while beds seldom do. In the above figure, which\r\nrepresents a vertical cutting or _section_ through horizontal strata,\r\nthe planes of lamination are shewn at _l, l, l_, and those of\r\nstratification at _s, s, s_. There are hardly any limits to the\r\nthickness of a bed--it may range from an inch up to many feet or yards,\r\nwhile _laminae_ vary in thickness from an inch downwards.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 1.--_st_, sandstone, and _sh_, shale: _s_,\r\n   lines or planes of bedding; _l_, lines or planes of\r\n   lamination.]\r\n\r\n35. Hitherto we have been considering the _laminae_ and _strata_ as lying\r\nin an approximately horizontal plane. Sometimes, however, the layers of\r\ndeposition in a single stratum are inclined at various angles to\r\nthemselves, as in the following figure. This structure is called _false\r\nbedding_; the layers or laminae not coinciding with the planes of\r\nstratification. It owes its origin to shifting currents, such as the ebb\r\nand flow of the tide, and very often characterises deposits which have\r\nbeen formed in shallow water. (Hillocks of drifting sand frequently shew\r\na similar structure, but their false bedding is, as a rule, much more\r\npronounced.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 2.--False Bedding.]\r\n\r\n36. _Mud-cracks and Rain-prints._--The surfaces of some beds\r\noccasionally exhibit markings closely resembling those seen upon a flat\r\nsandy beach after the retreat of the tide--hence they are called\r\n_ripple-marks_ or _current-marks_. They are, of course, due to the\r\ngentle current action which pushes along the grains of sand, and hence,\r\nsuch marks may be formed wherever a current sweeps over the bottom of\r\nthe sea with energy just sufficient for the purpose. But since the\r\nnecessary conditions for the formation of _ripple-mark_ occur most\r\nabundantly in shallow water, its frequent appearance in a series of\r\nstrata may often be taken as evidence, so far, for the shallow-water\r\norigin of the beds. Besides ripple-marks we may also detect occasionally\r\non the surfaces of certain strata _mud-cracks_ and _rain-prints_. These\r\noccur most commonly in fine-grained beds, as in flagstones, argillaceous\r\nsandstones, shales, &c. The _mud-cracks_ resemble those upon a mud-flat\r\nwhich are caused by the desiccation and consequent shrinkage of the mud\r\nwhen exposed to the sun. The old cracks have been subsequently filled\r\nup again by a deposition of mud or sand, usually of harder consistency\r\nthan the rock traversed by the cracks. Hence, when the bed that overlies\r\nthe mud-cracks is removed, we find a cast of these projecting from its\r\nunder surface, or frequently the cast remains in its mould, and forms a\r\nseries of curious ridges ramifying over the whole surface of the old\r\nmud-flat. _Rain-prints_ are the small pits caused by the impact of large\r\ndrops. They are usually deeper at one side than the other, from which we\r\ncan infer the direction of the wind at the time the rain-drops fell.\r\nLike the mud-cracks, they are most commonly met with in fine-grained\r\nbeds, and have been preserved in a similar manner. Some geologists have\r\nalso been able to detect _wave-marks_, 'faint outlinings of curved form\r\non a sandstone layer, like the outline left by a wave along the limit\r\nwhere it dies out upon a beach.'\r\n\r\n37. _Succession of Strata._--The succession of strata is often very\r\ndiversified. Thus, we may observe in one and the same section numberless\r\nalternating beds of sandstone and shale from an inch or so up to several\r\nfeet each in thickness, with seams of coal, fireclay, ironstone, and\r\nlimestone interstratified among them. In other cases, again, the\r\nsuccession is simpler, and some deep quarries shew only one bed, as is\r\nthe case with certain limestones, fine-grained sandstones (liver-rock),\r\nand many volcanic rocks. Some limestones, indeed, shew small trace of\r\nbedding throughout a vertical thickness of hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\n38. _Beds, their Extent, &c._--Beds of rock are not only of very\r\ndifferent thicknesses, but they are also of very variable extent. Some\r\nmay thin gradually away, or 'die out' suddenly, in a few feet or\r\nyards, while others may extend over many square miles. Beds of\r\nlimestone, for example, can often be traced for leagues in several\r\ndirections; and if this be the case with certain single beds, it is\r\nstill more true of groups of strata. Thus the coal-bearing strata\r\nbelonging to what is called the Carboniferous period cover large areas\r\nin Wales, England, Scotland, and Ireland, not less, probably, than\r\n6000 square miles; and strata belonging to the same great period\r\nspread over considerable tracts on the Continent, and a very extensive\r\narea in North America. It holds generally true that beds of\r\nfine-grained materials are not only of more equal thickness\r\nthroughout, but have also a wider extension than coarser-grained\r\nrocks. Fine sandstones, for example, extend over a wider area, and\r\npreserve a more equable thickness throughout than conglomerates, while\r\nlimestones and coals are more continuous than either.\r\n\r\n39. When a bed is followed for any distance it is frequently found to\r\nthin away, and give place to another occupying the same plane or\r\n_horizon_. Thus a shale will be replaced by a sandstone, a sandstone by\r\na conglomerate, and _vice versa_. Sometimes also we may find a shale, as\r\nwe trace it in some particular direction, gradually becoming charged\r\nwith calcareous matter, so as by and by to pass, as it were, into\r\nlimestone. Every bed must, of course, end somewhere, either by thus\r\ngradually passing into another, or by thinning out so as to allow beds\r\nwhich immediately overlie and underlie it to come together. Not\r\nunfrequently, however, a bed will stop abruptly, as in fig. 3.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Sudden ending of Bed at x.]\r\n\r\n40. _Sequence of Beds._--It requires little reflection to see that the\r\ndivision plane between two beds may represent a very long period of\r\ntime. Let the following diagram represent a section of strata, _s_ being\r\nbeds of grit, and _a_, _b_, _c_, beds of sandstone and shale. It is\r\nevident that the beds s must have been formed before the strata _b_ were\r\ndeposited above them. At x, the beds _a_ and _b_ come together, and were\r\nattention to be confined to that part of the section, the observer might\r\nbe led to infer that no great space of time elapsed between the\r\ndeposition of these two beds. Yet we see that an interval sufficient to\r\nallow of the formation of the beds _s_ must really have intervened. It\r\nis now well known that in many cases planes of bedding represent 'breaks\r\nin the succession' of strata--'breaks' which are often the equivalents\r\nof considerable thicknesses of strata. In one place, for example, we may\r\nhave an apparently complete sequence of beds, as _a_, _b_, _c_, which a\r\nmore extended knowledge of the same beds, as these are developed in some\r\nother locality, enables us to supplement, as _a_, _s_, _b_, _c_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Sequence of Beds.]\r\n\r\n41. _Joints._--Besides _planes_ or _lines of bedding_, there are certain\r\nother division planes or _joints_ by which rocks are intersected. The\r\nformer, as we have seen, are congenital; the latter are subsequent.\r\nJoints cut right across the bedding, and are often variously combined,\r\none set of joint planes traversing the rock in one direction, and\r\nanother set or sets intersecting these at various angles. Thus, in many\r\ncases the rocks are so divided as easily to separate into more or less\r\nirregular fragments of various sizes. Besides these confused joints\r\nthere are usually other more regular division planes, which intersect\r\nthe strata in some definite directions, and run parallel to each other,\r\noften over a wide area: these are called _master-joints_. Two sets of\r\nmaster-joints may intersect the same strata, and when such is the case,\r\nthe rock may be quarried in cuboidal blocks, the size of which will\r\nvary, of course, according as the two sets of joints are near or wide\r\napart. Joints may either gape or be quite close; so close, indeed, as in\r\nmany cases to be invisible to the naked eye. Certain igneous rocks\r\nfrequently shew division planes which meet each other in such a way as\r\nto form a series of polygonal prisms. The basalt of Staffa and Giants'\r\nCauseway are familiar examples of this structure. Jointing is due to the\r\ngradual consolidation of the strata, and hence, in a series of strata,\r\nwe may find the separate beds, according to their composition, very\r\nvariously affected, some being much more abundantly jointed than\r\nothers. Master-joints which traverse a wide district in some definite\r\ndirection probably owe their origin to tension, the strata having been\r\nsubjected to some strain by the underground forces.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Beds of Limestone (_a_), Sandstone\r\n   (_b_), and Shale (_c_), divided into cuboidal masses by\r\n   master-joints.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Columnar Structure.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Bedding, Joints, and Cleavage (after\r\n   Murchison).]\r\n\r\n42. _Cleavage._--Fine-grained rocks, more especially those which are\r\nargillaceous, occasionally shew another kind of structure, which is\r\ncalled _cleavage_. Common clay-slate is a type of the structure. This\r\nrock splits up into innumerable thin laminae or plates, the surface of\r\nwhich may either be somewhat rough, or as smooth nearly as glass. The\r\ncleavage planes, however, need not be parallel with the planes of\r\nbedding; in most cases, indeed, they cut right across these, and\r\ncontinue parallel to each other often over a very wide region. The\r\noriginal bedding is sometimes entirely obliterated, and in most cases of\r\nwell-defined cleavage is always more or less obscure.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding diagram, the general phenomena of _bedding_,\r\n_jointing_, and _cleavage_ are represented. The lines of bedding are\r\nshewn at S, S; another set of division-planes (joints) is observed at J,\r\nJ, intersecting the former at right angles--A, B, C being the exposed\r\nfaces of joints. The lines of cleavage are seen at D, D, cutting across\r\nthe planes of bedding and jointing.\r\n\r\n43. _Foliation_ is another kind of superinduced structure. In a\r\nfoliated rock the mineral ingredients have been crystallised and\r\narranged in layers along either the planes of original bedding or those\r\nof cleavage. Mica-schist and gneiss are typical examples.\r\n\r\n44. _Concretions._--In many rocks a concretionary structure may be\r\nobserved. Some sandstones and shales appear as if made up of spheroidal\r\nmasses, the mineral composition of the spheroids not differing\r\napparently from that of the unchanged rock. So in some kinds of\r\nlimestone, as in _dolomite_, the concretionary structure is often highly\r\ndeveloped, the rock resembling now irregular heaps of turnips with\r\nfinger-and-toe disease, again, piles of cannon-balls, or bunches of\r\ngrapes, and agglomerations of musket-shot. A spheroidal structure is\r\noccasionally met with amongst some igneous rocks. This is well seen in\r\nthe case of rocks having the basaltic structure, in which the pillars,\r\nbeing jointed transversely, decompose along their division planes, so as\r\nto form irregular globular masses. In many cases, certain mineral matter\r\nwhich was originally diffused through a rock has segregated so as to\r\nform nodules and irregular layers. Examples of this are _chert_ nodules\r\nin limestone; _flint_ nodules in chalk; _clay-ironstone_ balls in shale,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Dip and Strike of Strata.]\r\n\r\n45. _Inclination of Strata._--Beds of aqueous strata must have been\r\ndeposited in horizontal or approximately horizontal planes; but we now\r\nfind them most frequently inclined at various angles to the horizon, and\r\noften even standing on end. They sometimes, however, retain a horizontal\r\nposition over a large tract of country. The angle which the inclined\r\nstrata make with the horizon is called the _dip_, the degree of\r\ninclination being the _amount_ of the dip; and a line drawn at right\r\nangles to the dip is called the _strike_ of the beds. Thus, a bed\r\ndipping south-west will have a north-west and south-east strike. The\r\n_crop_ or _outcrop_ (sometimes also, but rarely, called the _basset\r\nedge_) of a bed is the place where the edge of the stratum comes to view\r\nat the surface. We may look upon inclined beds as being merely parts of\r\nmore or less extensive undulations of strata, the tops of the\r\nundulations having been removed so as to expose the truncated edges of\r\nthe beds. In the following diagram, for example, the outcrops of\r\nlimestone seen at _l_, _l_, are evidently portions of one and the same\r\nstratum, the dotted lines indicating its former extent. The\r\ntrough-shaped arrangement of the beds at _s_ is called a _synclinal\r\ncurve_, or simply a syncline; the arched strata at _a_ forming, on the\r\ncontrary, an _anticlinal curve_ or _anticline_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Anticlines and Synclines.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Contorted Strata.]\r\n\r\nWhen strata shew many and rapid curves, they are said to be contorted.\r\nThe diagram section (fig. 10) will best explain what is meant by this\r\nkind of structure.\r\n\r\n46. In certain regions, the strata often dip in one and the same\r\ndirection for many miles, at an angle approaching verticality, as in the\r\nfollowing section. It might be inferred, therefore, that from A to B we\r\nhad a gradually ascending series--that as we paced over the outcrop we\r\nwere stepping constantly from a lower to a higher geological horizon.\r\nBut, in such cases, the dip is deceptive, the same beds being repeated\r\nagain and again in a series of great foldings of the strata. Such is\r\nthe case over wide areas in the upland districts of the south of\r\nScotland. The section (fig. 11) shews that the beds are actually\r\ninverted, the strata at x x being bent back upon strata which really\r\noverlie them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Inversion of Strata.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 12.--Contemporaneous Erosion.]\r\n\r\n47. _Contemporaneous Erosion._--Occasionally a group of strata gives\r\nproof that pauses in the deposition of sediment took place, during which\r\nrunning water scooped out of the sediment channels of greater or less\r\nwidth, which subsequently became filled up with similar or dissimilar\r\nmaterials. The diagram (fig. 12) will render this plain. At _a_ we have\r\nbeds of sandstone, which it is evident were at one time throughout as\r\nthick as they still are at x x. Having been worn away to the extent\r\nindicated, a deposition of clay (_b_) succeeded; and this, in turn,\r\nbecame eroded at _c_, _c_, the hollows being filled up again with coarse\r\nsand and gravel. In former paragraphs, we found reason to believe that\r\nlines of bedding indicated certain pauses in the deposition of strata.\r\nHere, in the present case, we have more ample proof in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 13.--Unconformability.]\r\n\r\n48. _Unconformability._--But the most striking evidence of such pauses\r\nin the deposition of strata is afforded by the phenomenon called\r\n_unconformability_. When one set of rocks is found resting on the\r\nupturned edges of a lower set, the former are said to be _unconformable_\r\nto the latter. In the above section (fig. 13), _a_, _a_, are beds of\r\nsandstone resting on the upturned edges of beds of limestone, shale, and\r\nsandstone, _l_, _s_. Figs. 14 and 15 give other examples of the same\r\nappearance. It is evident that, in the case of fig. 14, the discordant\r\nbedding chronicles the lapse of a very long period. We have to conceive\r\nfirst of the deposition of the underlying strata in horizontal or\r\napproximately horizontal layers; then we have to think of the time when\r\nthey were crumpled up into great convolutions, and the tops of the\r\nconvolutions (the anticlines) were planed away: all these changes\r\nintervened, of course, after the lower set was deposited, and before the\r\nupper series was laid down. In the case represented in fig. 15, we have\r\na double unconformability, implying a still more elaborate series of\r\nchanges, and probably, therefore, a still longer lapse of time.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 14.--Violent Unconformability.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 15.--Double Unconformability.]\r\n\r\n49. _Overlap._--When the upper beds of a conformable group of strata\r\nspread over a wider area than the lower members of the same series, they\r\nare said to _overlap_. The accompanying diagram shews this appearance.\r\nAn overlap proves that a gradual submergence of the land was going on at\r\nthe time the strata were being accumulated. As the land disappeared\r\nbelow the water, the sediment gradually spread over a wider area, the\r\nmore recently deposited sediment being laid down in places which existed\r\nas dry land at the time when the earliest accumulations were formed.\r\nThus, in the accompanying illustration (fig. 16), the stratum marked 1,\r\nresting unconformably upon older strata, is overlapped by 2, as that is\r\nby 3, and so on--all the beds in succession coming to repose upon the\r\nolder strata at higher and higher levels, as the old land subsided.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 16.--Overlap.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 17.--Fault.]\r\n\r\n50. _Dislocations or Faults._--When strata, once continuous, have been\r\nbroken across, and displaced or shifted along the line of breakage, they\r\nare said to be _faulted_, the fissure along which the displacement\r\noccurs being termed a _fault_ or _dislocation_. The simplest form of a\r\nfault is that shewn in the following diagram, where strata of sandstone\r\nand shale, with a coal-seam, S, have been shifted along the line _f_.\r\nThe direction in which the _fault_ is inclined[D] is its _hade_, and the\r\ndegree of _vertical displacement_ of the beds is the _amount_ of the\r\ndislocation. Generally, the beds seem to be pulled _down_ in the\r\ndirection of the _downthrow_, and _drawn up_ on the opposite side of the\r\nfault, as shewn in the diagram. Sometimes the rocks on each side of a\r\nfault are smoothed and polished, and covered with long scratches, as if\r\nthe two sides of the fissure had been rubbed together. This is the\r\nappearance called _slickensides_. Slickensides, however, may occur on\r\nthe walls of a fissure which is not a displacement, but a mere joint or\r\ncrack. A dislocation is spoken of as a downthrow or an upcast, according\r\nto the direction in which it is approached. Thus, a miner working along\r\nthe coal-seam S, from _a_ to _b_, would describe the fault, _f_, as an\r\n_upcast_, since he would have to mine to a _higher_ level to catch his\r\ncoal again. But, had he approached the fault from _c_ to _d_, he would\r\nthen have termed it a _downthrow_, because he would see from the hade of\r\nthe fault that his coal-seam must be sought for at a _lower_ level.\r\nFaults are of all sizes, from a foot or two up to vertical displacements\r\nof thousands of feet. Powerful dislocations can often be followed for\r\nmany miles across a country, running in a more or less linear direction.\r\nThus, one large fault has been traced across the breadth of Scotland,\r\nfrom near St Abb's Head, in the east, to the coast of Wigtown, in the\r\nwest. Every large throw is accompanied by a number of smaller\r\nones--some of which run parallel to the main fault, while many others\r\nseem to run out from this at various angles. Faults are of all\r\ngeological ages. Some date back to a most remote antiquity, others are\r\nof quite recent origin; and no doubt faults are occurring even now. In\r\nthe following diagram, the strata, _a, a_, have been faulted and planed\r\naway before the strata, _b_, were deposited. Hence, in this case, it is\r\nevident that if we know the geological age of the beds, _a_ and _b_, we\r\ncan have an approximation to the age of the fault. If the beds, _a_, be\r\nCarboniferous, and those at _b_ Permian, then we should say the fault\r\nwas _post-Carboniferous_ or _pre-Permian_.\r\n\r\n   [D] The degree of inclination is very variable. It may occur at\r\n       almost any angle up to vertical. But, as a rule, the hade of the\r\n       more powerful faults is steeper than that of minor displacements.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 18.--Ground-plan of Large Main Fault and\r\n   Minor Displacement Fissures.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 19.--Faulted Strata covered by undisturbed\r\n   Strata.]\r\n\r\n51. _Metamorphic and Igneous Rocks--mode of their occurrence._--In the\r\nforegoing remarks on the structure and arrangement of rocks we have had\r\nreference chiefly to the aqueous strata--that is to say, the\r\n_mechanically_, _chemically_, and _organically_ formed rocks. We were\r\nnecessarily compelled, however, to make some reference to, and to give\r\nsome description of, certain structures and arrangements which are not\r\npeculiar to aqueous strata, but characterise many metamorphic and\r\nigneous rocks as well. To avoid repetition it was also necessary, while\r\ntreating of _joints_, &c., to give some account of certain structures\r\nwhich are the result of metamorphic action. But, for sake of clearness,\r\nwe have reserved special account of the structure and mode of occurrence\r\nof metamorphic and igneous rocks to this place. After what has been said\r\nas to the structure and arrangement of aqueous strata, it is hardly\r\nneedful to say much about the crystalline schists. These the student\r\nwill understand to be merely highly altered aqueous rocks,[E] in which\r\nthe marks of their origin are still more or less distinctly traceable.\r\nAs a rule, metamorphic strata are contorted, twisted, and crumpled,\r\nalthough here and there comparatively horizontal stretches of altered\r\nrocks may be observed. The regions in which they occur are often hilly\r\nand mountainous, but this is by no means invariably the case. The\r\ngreater part of the mountainous regions of the British Islands is\r\noccupied by rocks which are more or less altered; the more crystalline\r\nrocks, such as mica-schist, gneiss, &c., being abundantly developed in\r\nthe Scottish Highlands, and in the north and west of Ireland; while\r\nthose which are less altered cover large areas in the south of Scotland,\r\nand in Wales and the north-west of England. Throughout these wide areas\r\nthe rocks generally dip at high angles, and contortion and crumpling are\r\nof common occurrence. The finer-grained clay-rocks also exhibit fine\r\ncleavage planes, and are in some places quarried for roofing-slates--the\r\nWelsh quarries being the most famous. Here and there, bedding is\r\nentirely effaced, and the resulting rock is quite amorphous, and,\r\nbecoming gradually more and more crystalline, passes at last into a rock\r\nwhich in many cases is true granite. The original strata have\r\ndisappeared, and granite occupies their place, in such a way as to lead\r\nto the inference that the granite is merely the aqueous strata which\r\nhave been fused up, as it were, _in situ_. At other times the granite\r\nwould appear to have been erupted amongst the aqueous strata, for these\r\nare highly confused, and baked, as it were, at their junction with the\r\ngranite, from which, also, long veins are seen protruding into the\r\nsurrounding beds. Metamorphic granite, then, graduates, as a rule,\r\nalmost imperceptibly into rocks which are clearly of aqueous origin;\r\nwhile on the contrary the junction-line between igneous granite and the\r\nsurrounding rocks is always well marked. The origin of granite, however,\r\nis a difficult question, and one which has given rise to much\r\ndiscussion. Some further remarks upon the subject will be found in the\r\nsequel under the heading of _Metamorphism_.\r\n\r\n   [E] Igneous rocks have also in some cases undergone considerable\r\n       alteration; fine-grained tuffs, for example, occasionally\r\n       assume a crystalline texture.\r\n\r\n52. True _igneous rocks_ occur either in beds or as irregular amorphous\r\nmasses. When they occur as beds interstratified with aqueous strata,\r\nthey are said to be _contemporaneous_, because they have evidently been\r\nerupted at the time the series of strata among which they appear was\r\nbeing amassed. When, on the other hand, they cut across the bedding,\r\nthey are said to be _subsequent_ or _intrusive_, because in this case\r\nthey have been formed at a period _subsequent_ to the strata among which\r\nthey have been _intruded_. The bed upon which a contemporaneous igneous\r\nrock reclines, often affords marks of having been subjected to the\r\naction of heat; sandstones being hardened, and frequently much jointed\r\nand cracked, owing to the shrinking induced by the heat of the once\r\nmolten rock above, and clay-rocks often assuming a baked appearance.\r\nThere is generally, also, some discoloration both in the pavement of\r\nrock upon which the igneous mass lies, and in the under portions of the\r\nlatter itself. The beds overlying a contemporaneous igneous rock,\r\nhowever, do not exhibit any marks of the action of heat; the old\r\nlava-stream having cooled before the sediment, now forming the overlying\r\nstrata, was accumulated over its surface. One may often notice how the\r\nsand and mud have quietly settled down into the irregular hollows and\r\ncrevices of the old lava, as in the following section, where _i_\r\nrepresents the igneous rock; _a_ being the baked pavement of sandstone,\r\n&c.; and _b_ the overlying sedimentary deposits. When the igneous rock\r\nitself is examined, its upper portions are often observed to be\r\nscoriaceous or cinder-like, and the under portions likewise frequently\r\nexhibit a similar appearance. It is generally most solid towards the\r\ncentre of the bed. The vesicles, or pores, in the upper and lower\r\nportions are often flattened, and are frequently filled with mineral\r\nmatter. Sometimes these cavities may have been filled at the time the\r\nrock was being erupted, but in most cases the mineral matter would\r\nappear to have been introduced subsequently by the action of water\r\npercolating through the rock. Occasionally we meet with igneous rocks\r\nwhich are more or less vesicular and amygdaloidal throughout their\r\nentire mass. Others, again, often shew no vesicular structure, but are\r\nhomogeneous from top to bottom. The texture is also very variable, and\r\nthis even in the same rock-mass; some portions being compact or\r\nfine-grained, and others coarsely crystalline. As a rule the rock is\r\nmost crystalline towards the centre, and gets finer-grained as the top\r\nand bottom of the bed are approached. Not unfrequently, however, an\r\nigneous rock will preserve the same texture throughout. The jointing is\r\nalso highly irregular as a rule. But in many cases, especially when the\r\nrock is fine-grained, the jointing is very regular. The basaltic columns\r\nof the Giants' Causeway and the Isle of Staffa are well-known examples\r\nof such regularly jointed masses. Igneous rocks frequently decompose\r\ninto a loose earthy mass (_wacke_), and this is most markedly the case\r\nwith those belonging to the basic group.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 20.--Contemporaneous Igneous Rock.]\r\n\r\n53. Contemporaneous igneous rocks are frequently associated with more or\r\nless regular beds of _breccia_, _conglomerate_, _ash_, _tuff_, &c. These\r\nare evidently the loose volcanic ejectamenta which accompanied former\r\neruptions of lava, and have been arranged by the action of water. Beds\r\nof such materials, however, frequently occur without any accompanying\r\nlava-form rocks. Nor are they always arranged in bedded masses. They\r\nsometimes appear filling vertical pipes which seem to have been the\r\nfunnels of old volcanoes. The following section exhibits the general\r\nappearance of one of these volcanic _necks_. They are very common in\r\nsome parts of Scotland, as in Ayrshire, and are frequently ranged along\r\nthe line of a fault in the strata. Fig. 21 shews such a neck of\r\nejectamenta, made up of fragments of various kinds of rock, such as\r\nsandstone, shale, limestone, coal, &c., sometimes without any admixture\r\nof igneous rocks. The strata through which the pipe has been pierced\r\nusually dip in towards the latter, and at their junction with the coarse\r\nagglomerate often shew marks of the action of heat, coal-seams having\r\nsometimes been 'burned' useless for a number of yards away from the\r\n'neck.'\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Neck filled with Volcanic Agglomerate.]\r\n\r\n54. Intrusive igneous rocks occur as _sheets_, _dykes_, and _necks_. The\r\nsheets frequently conform for long distances to the bedding of the\r\nstrata among which they occur, and are thus liable to be mistaken for\r\ncontemporaneous rocks. But when they are closely examined, it will be\r\nseen that they not only bake or alter the beds above and below them, but\r\nseldom keep precisely to one horizon or level--occasionally rising to a\r\nhigher, or sinking to a lower position in the strata, as shewn in the\r\nfollowing diagram-section. Dykes are wall-like masses of igneous strata\r\nwhich cut across the strata, generally at a high angle (see _d, d_, fig.\r\n22). In the neighbourhood of a recent volcanic orifice, numerous dykes\r\nare seen ramifying in all directions. In the British Islands some dykes\r\nhave been followed in a linear direction for very long distances.\r\nSometimes these occupy the sites of large dislocations, at other times\r\nthey have cut through the strata without displacing them. Occasionally\r\nthey appear to have been the feeders of the great sheets of igneous rock\r\nwhich here and there occur in their vicinity. The phenomena presented by\r\nthe _necks_ of intrusive rock do not differ from those characteristic of\r\n_agglomerate_ or _tuff necks_. The strata are bent down towards the\r\ncentral plug of igneous rock, and are generally more or less altered at\r\nthe line of junction.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 22.--Intrusive Sheet and Dykes: _i_, igneous\r\n   intrusive sheet; _d_, _d_, dykes; _s_, _s_, sedimentary strata.]\r\n\r\n55. Intrusive rocks offer, as a rule, some contrasts in texture to\r\ncontemporaneous masses. They are seldom amygdaloidal, but when they are\r\nso it is generally towards the centre of the mass. The kernels are\r\nusually minute and more or less spherical.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 23.--Contemporaneous and Intrusive Igneous\r\n   Rocks: _c_, _c_, contemporaneous trap-rocks[1]; _t_, _t_,\r\n   contemporaneous fragmental igneous rocks; _i_, _p_, _n_, _d_,\r\n   intrusive igneous rocks.]\r\n\r\nThe diagram (fig. 23) shews the general mode of occurrence of igneous\r\nrocks on the large scale. The stratified aqueous deposits are indicated\r\nat _a_, _a_. These are overlaid by a series of alternating beds of\r\ncrystalline (_c_) and fragmental (_t_) igneous rocks. An irregular\r\nintrusive sheet at _i_ cuts across the beds _a_, _a_. At _p_, another\r\nintrusive mass is seen rising in a pipe, as it were, and overflowing the\r\nbeds _a_, _a_, so as to form a cap. A volcanic neck filled with angular\r\nstones intersects the strata at _n_, and two dykes, approaching the\r\nvertical, traverse the bedded rocks at _d_, _d_. It will be noticed that\r\nthe contemporaneous igneous rocks form a series of escarpments rising\r\none above the other.\r\n\r\nThe alteration effected by igneous rocks is generally greatest in the\r\ncase of intrusive masses. This is well seen in some of our coal-fields,\r\nwhere the coal has frequently been destroyed over large areas by the\r\nproximity of masses of what was once melted rock. It is curious to\r\nnotice how the intrusive sheets in a great series of strata have forced\r\ntheir way along the lines of least resistance. Thus, in the Scottish\r\ncoal-fields, we find again and again that intrusive sheets have been\r\nsquirted along the planes occupied by coal-seams, these having been more\r\neasily attacked than beds of sandstone or shale. The coal in such cases\r\nis either entirely 'eaten up,' as it were, or converted into a black\r\nsoot. At other times, however, it is changed into a kind of coke, while\r\nother seams at a greater distance from the intrusive mass have been\r\naltered into a kind of 'blind coal' or _anthracite_.\r\n\r\nThese remarks on the mode of occurrence of igneous rocks are meant to\r\nrefer chiefly to those masses which occur in regions where volcanic\r\naction has long been extinct, as, for instance, in the British Islands.\r\nIn the sequel, some account will be given of the appearances presented\r\nby modern volcanoes and volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n   [1] It has been usual to apply the term _trap_ or _trappean_ rock\r\n       to all the old igneous rocks which could neither be classed\r\n       with the granites and syenites, nor yet with the recent lavas,\r\n       &c., which are connected with a more or less well-marked\r\n       volcanic vent. The term _trap_ (Swedish _trappa_, a flight of\r\n       steps) was suggested by the terraced or step-like appearance\r\n       presented by hills which are built up of successive beds of\r\n       igneous rock. But the passage from the granitic into the\r\n       so-called trap rocks, and from these into the distinctly\r\n       volcanic, is so very gradual, that it is impossible to say\r\n       where the one class ends and the other begins. The term _trap_,\r\n       therefore, has no scientific precision, although it is\r\n       sometimes very convenient as a kind of broad generic term to\r\n       include a large number of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL VEINS.\r\n\r\n56. The cracks and crevices and joint planes which intersect all rocks\r\nin a greater or less degree, are not unfrequently filled with\r\nsubsequently introduced mineral matter, forming what are termed _veins_.\r\nThis introduced matter may either be harder or less durable than the\r\nrock itself; in the former case, the veins will project from the surface\r\nof the stone, where that has been subjected to the weathering action of\r\nthe atmosphere; in the latter case, the veins, under like circumstances,\r\nare often partially emptied of their mineral matter. Not unfrequently,\r\nhowever, the more or less irregularly ramifying, non-metalliferous veins\r\nappear as if they had segregated from the body of the rock in which they\r\noccur, as in the case of the quartz veins in granite. Besides these\r\nirregular veins, the rocks of certain districts are traversed in one or\r\nmore determinate directions by fissures, extending from the surface down\r\nto unknown depths. These great fissures are often in like manner filled\r\nwith mineral matter. The minerals are usually arranged in bands or\r\nlayers which run parallel to the walls of the vein. Quartz, fluor-spar,\r\nbarytes, calcite, &c. are among the commonest vein-minerals, and with\r\nthese are frequently associated ores of various metals. A vein may vary\r\nin width from less than an inch up to many yards, and the arrangement of\r\nits contents is also subject to much variation. Instead of parallel\r\nlayers of spars and ores, frequently a confused mass of clay and broken\r\nrocks, which are often cemented together with sparry matter, chokes up\r\nthe vein. The ore in a vein may occur in one or more ribs, which often\r\nvary in thickness from a mere line up to masses several yards in width.\r\nSometimes the rocks are dislocated along the line of fissure occupied by\r\na great vein; at other times no dislocation can be observed. Mineral\r\nveins, however, do not necessarily occupy dislocation fissures. They\r\noften occur in cavities which have been formed by the erosive action of\r\nacidulated water, in the way described in pars. 59, 60, and 61. This is\r\nfrequently the case in calcareous strata. Such veins usually coincide\r\nmore or less with the bedding of the rocks, but in the case of thick\r\nlimestones they not unfrequently cut across the bedding in a vertical or\r\nnearly vertical direction, forming what are termed _pipe-veins_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYNAMICAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n57. Having considered the composition, structure, and arrangement of the\r\nrock-masses which form the solid crust of our globe, we have next to\r\ninquire into the nature of those physical agencies by the action of\r\nwhich the rocks, as we now see them, have been produced. The work\r\nperformed by the various forces employed in modifying the earth's crust\r\nis at one and the same time destructive and reconstructive. Rocks are\r\nbeing continually demolished, and out of their ruins new rocks are being\r\nbuilt. In other words, matter is constantly entering into new\r\nrelations--now existing as solid rock, or in solution in water, or\r\ncarried as the lightest dust on the wings of the wind; now being swept\r\ndown by rivers into the sea, or brought under the influence of\r\nsubterranean heat--but always changing, sooner or later, slowly or\r\nrapidly, from one form to another. The great geological agents of change\r\nare these: 1. THE ATMOSPHERE; 2. WATER; 3. PLANTS AND ANIMALS; 4.\r\nSUBTERRANEAN FORCES. We shall consider these in succession.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\n58. All rocks have a tendency to waste away under the influence of the\r\natmosphere. This is termed _weathering_. Under the influence of the\r\nsun's heat, the external portions of a rock expand, and again contract\r\nwhen they cool at night. The effect of this alternate expansion and\r\ncontraction is often strikingly manifest in tropical countries: some\r\nrocks being gradually disintegrated, and crumbling into grit and sand;\r\nothers becoming cracked, and either exfoliating or breaking up all over\r\ntheir surface into small angular fragments. Again, in countries subject\r\nto alternations of extreme heat and cold, similar weathering action\r\ntakes place. The chemical action of the atmosphere is most observable in\r\nthe case of calcareous rocks. The carbonic acid almost invariably\r\npresent acts as a solvent, so that dew and rain, which otherwise would\r\nin many cases have but feeble disintegrating power, are enabled to eat\r\ninto such rocks as chalk and limestone, calcareous sandstones, &c. The\r\noxygen of the atmosphere also unites with certain minerals, such as the\r\nproto-salts of iron, and converts them into peroxides. It is this action\r\nwhich produces the red and yellow ferruginous discolorations in\r\nsandstone. Chemical changes also take place in the case of many igneous\r\nrocks, the result being that a weathered 'crust' forms wherever such\r\nrocks are exposed to the action of the atmosphere. Of course, the rate\r\nat which a rock weathers depends upon its mineralogical and chemical\r\ncomposition. Limestones weather much more rapidly than clay-rocks; and\r\naugitic igneous rocks, as a rule, disintegrate more readily than the\r\nmore highly silicated species. The weathering action of the atmosphere\r\nis also greatly aided by frost, as we shall see presently. The result of\r\nall this weathering is the formation of _soil_--soil being only the\r\nfine-grained debris of the weathered rocks. The angular debris found at\r\nthe base of all cliffs in temperate and arctic regions, and on every\r\nhill and mountain which is subjected to alternations of extreme heat and\r\ncold, is also the effect of weathering. But these and other effects of\r\nfrost will be treated of under the head of _Frozen Water_. The hillocks\r\nand ridges of loose sand (_sand dunes_) found in many places along the\r\nsea-margin, and even in the interior of some continents, as in Africa\r\nand Asia, are due to the action of the wind, which drives the loose\r\ngrains before it, and piles them up. Sometimes also the wind carries in\r\nsuspension the finest dust, which may be transported for vast distances\r\nbefore it falls to the ground. Thus, fine dust shot into the air by the\r\nvolcanoes of Iceland has been blown as far as the Shetland Islands; and\r\nin tropical countries the dust of the dried-up and parched beds of lakes\r\nand rivers is often swept away during hurricanes, and carried in thick\r\nclouds for leagues. Rain falling through this dust soaks it up, and\r\ncomes down highly discoloured, brown and red. This is the so-called\r\n_blood-rain_. Minute microscopic animal and vegetable organisms are\r\noften commingled with this dust, and falling into streams, lakes, or the\r\nsea, may thus become eventually buried in sediments very far removed\r\nfrom the place that gave them birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\n59. The geological action of water in modifying the crust of the earth\r\nis twofold--namely, _chemical_ and _mechanical_.\r\n\r\n_Underground Water._--All the moisture which we see falling as rain or\r\nsnow does not flow immediately away by brooks and rivers to the sea.\r\nSome portion of it soaks into the ground, and finds a passage for itself\r\nby cracks and fissures in the rocks below, from which it emerges at last\r\nas springs, either at the surface of the earth, or at the bottom of the\r\nsea. Such are the more obvious courses pursued by the water--it flows\r\noff either by sub-aerial or subterranean channels. But a not\r\ninconsiderable portion soaks into the solid rocks themselves, which are\r\nall more or less porous and pervious. Water thus slowly soaking often\r\neffects very considerable chemical changes. Sometimes the binding matter\r\nwhich held the separate particles of the rock together is dissolved out,\r\nand the rock is thus rendered soft and crumbling; at other times, the\r\nreverse takes place, and the water deposits, in the minute interstitial\r\npores, some binding matter by which the partially or wholly incoherent\r\ngrains are agglutinated into a solid mass. Thus what were originally\r\nhard and tough rocks become disintegrated to such a degree, that they\r\ncrumble to powder soon after they are exposed to the air; while some\r\nagain are converted into a clay, and may be dug readily with a spade.\r\nAnd, on the other hand, loose sand is glued into a hard building-stone.\r\nThere are many other changes effected upon rocks by water, in virtue of\r\nthe chemical agents which it holds in solution. Indeed, it may be said\r\nthat there are very few, if any, rocks in which the chemical action of\r\ninterstitial water has not formerly been, or is not at present being,\r\ncarried on. Besides that which soaks through the rocks themselves, there\r\nis always a large proportion of underground water, which, as we have\r\nsaid above, finds a circuitous route for itself by joints, cracks, and\r\ncrevices. After coursing for, it may be, miles underground, such water\r\neventually emerges as springs, which contain in solution the various\r\ningredients which the water has chemically extracted from the rocks.\r\nThese ingredients are then deposited in proportion as the mineral water\r\nsuffers from evaporation. Water impregnated with carbonate of lime, for\r\nexample, deposits that compound as soon as evaporation has carried off a\r\ncertain percentage of the water itself, and the carbonic acid gas which\r\nit held. This is the origin of the mineral called _travertine_ or\r\n_calcareous tufa_, which is so commonly met with on the margins of\r\nsprings, rivers, and waterfalls.\r\n\r\n60. _Stalactites_ and _stalagmites_ have been formed in a similar way.\r\nWater slowly oozing from the roof of a limestone cavern partially\r\nevaporates there, and a thin pellicle of carbonate of lime is formed;\r\nwhile that portion of the water which falls to the ground, and is there\r\nevaporated, likewise gives rise to the formation of carbonate of lime.\r\nBy such constant dropping and evaporating, long tongue-and icicle-like\r\npendants (_stalactites_) grow downwards from the roof; while at the same\r\ntime domes and bosses (_stalagmites_) grow upwards from the floor, so as\r\nsometimes to meet the former and give rise to continuous pillars and\r\ncolumns. The great solvent power of carbonated water is shewn first by\r\nthe chemical analysis of springs, and, secondly, by the great wasting\r\neffects which the long-continued action of these has brought about.\r\nThus, it has been estimated that the fifty springs near Carlsbad, which\r\nyield eight hundred thousand cubic feet of water in twenty-four hours,\r\ncontain in solution as much lime as would go to form a mass of stone\r\nweighing two hundred thousand pounds. Warm, or, as they are termed,\r\n_thermal_ springs, frequently carry away with them, out of the bowels of\r\nthe earth, vast quantities of mineral matter in solution. The waters at\r\nBath, for instance, are estimated to bring to the surface an annual\r\namount of various salts, the mass of which is not less than 554 cubic\r\nyards. One of the springs of Loueche, France, however, carries out with\r\nit no less than 8,822,400 pounds of gypsum annually, which is equal to\r\nabout 2122 cubic yards.\r\n\r\n61. It is easy to conceive, therefore, that in the course of ages great\r\nalterations must be caused by springs. Caves and winding galleries, and\r\nirregular channels, will be worn out of the rocks which are thus being\r\ndissolved. Especially will this be the case in countries where\r\ncalcareous rocks abound. It is in such regions, accordingly, where we\r\nmeet with the most striking examples of caves and underground\r\nriver-channels. The largest cave at present known is the Mammoth Cave,\r\nin Kentucky. This remarkable hollow consists of numerous winding\r\ngalleries and passages that cross and recross, and the united length of\r\nwhich is said to be 217 miles. In calcareous countries, rivers, after\r\nflowing for, it may be, miles at the surface, suddenly disappear into\r\nthe ground, and flow often for long distances before they reappear in\r\nthe light of day. In some regions, indeed, nearly all the drainage is\r\nsubterranean. The surface of the ground, in calcareous countries,\r\nfrequently shews circular depressions, caused by the falling in of the\r\nroofs of caverns. Sometimes, also, great masses of rock, often miles in\r\nextent, get loosened by the dissolving action of subterranean water, and\r\ncrash downwards into the valleys. Such _landslips_, as they are called,\r\nare not, however, confined to calcareous regions. In 1806, a large\r\nsection of the Rossberg, a mountain lying to the north of the Righi,\r\nconsisting of conglomerate overlying beds of clay, rushed down into the\r\nplains of Goldau, overwhelming four villages and nearly a thousand\r\ninhabitants. The cause of this catastrophe was undoubtedly the softening\r\ninto mud of the clay-beds on which the conglomerate rested, for the\r\nseason which had just terminated when the slip took place had been very\r\nwet. The mass of material that slid down was estimated to contain\r\nupwards of fifty-four millions of cubic yards; it reached not less than\r\ntwo and a half miles in length, by some three hundred and fifty yards\r\nwide, and thirty-five yards thick.\r\n\r\n62. _Surface-water--Rain._--Having now learned something as to the\r\nmodifications produced by underground water, we turn next to consider\r\nthe action of surface-water, and the results arising from that action.\r\nRain, when it falls to the ground, carries with it some carbonic acid\r\ngas which it has absorbed from the atmosphere. Armed with this solvent,\r\nit attacks certain rocks, more especially limestones and chalk, a\r\ncertain proportion of which it licks up and delivers over to brooks and\r\nstreams. Under its influence, also, the finer particles of the soil are\r\never slowly making their way from higher to lower levels. Rocks which\r\nare being gradually disintegrated by weathering have their finer grains\r\nand particles, thus loosened, carried away by rain. Nor is this\r\nrain-action so inconsiderable as might be supposed. In the gentler\r\nhollows of an undulating country, we frequently find accumulations of\r\nclay, loam, and brick-earth, which often reach many feet in thickness,\r\nand which are undoubtedly the results of rain washing down the particles\r\nof soil, &c. from the adjacent slopes.\r\n\r\n63. _River-action._--The water of streams and rivers almost invariably\r\ncontains in solution one or more chemical compounds, and in this respect\r\ndoes not differ from the water of springs. Of course, this mineral\r\nmatter is derived in considerable measure from springs, but is also no\r\ndoubt to a large extent taken up by the rivers themselves, as they wash\r\nthe rocks and soils on their journey to the sea. The amount of mineral\r\nmatter thus transported must be something enormous, as is shewn by the\r\nchemical analyses of river-water. Bischof calculated that the Rhine\r\ncarries in solution as much carbonate of lime as would suffice for the\r\nyearly formation of three hundred and thirty-two thousand millions of\r\noyster-shells of the usual size--a quantity equal to a cube five hundred\r\nand sixty feet in the side, or a square bed a foot thick, and upwards of\r\ntwo miles in the side. But the mechanical erosion effected by running\r\nwater is what impresses us most with the importance of rivers as\r\ngeological agencies. This erosive action is due to the gravel, sand, and\r\nmud carried along by the water. These ingredients act as files in the\r\nhand of a workman, and grind, polish, and reduce the rocks against which\r\nthey are borne. The beds of some streams that flow over solid rock are\r\noften pitted with circular holes, at the bottom of which one invariably\r\nfinds a few rounded stones. These stones, kept in constant motion by the\r\nwater, are the means by which the _pot-holes_, as they are called, have\r\nbeen excavated. When pot-holes are numerous, they often unite so as to\r\nform curious smooth-sided trenches and gullies. The same filing action\r\ngoes on all over the bed of the stream wherever the solid rock is\r\nexposed. And while the latter is being gradually reduced, the stones and\r\ngrit which act as the files are themselves worn and reduced; so that\r\nstones diminish in size, and grit passes into fine sand and mud, as they\r\nmove from higher to lower levels. No doubt the erosive action of running\r\nwater appears to have but small effect in a short time, and we are apt,\r\ntherefore, to underestimate its power. But when our observations extend,\r\nwe see it is quite otherwise, and that, so far from being unimportant,\r\nrunning water is really one of the most powerful of all the geological\r\nagencies that are employed in modifying the earth's crust. Even within a\r\ncomparatively short time, it is able to effect very considerable\r\nchanges. Thus, the river Simeto, in Sicily, having become dammed by a\r\nstream of lava flowing from Etna, succeeded, in two hundred and fifty\r\nyears, in cutting through hard solid basalt a new channel for itself,\r\nwhich measured from twenty to fifty metres in depth, and from twelve to\r\neighteen in breadth. When, also, we remember the fact, that no river is\r\nabsolutely free from mineral matter held in suspension, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, all running water is more or less discoloured with sediment,\r\nwhich is merely the material derived from the disintegration of rocks,\r\nit will appear to us difficult to overestimate the power of watery\r\nerosion. To the mineral matter held in suspension, we have to add the\r\ncoarser detritus, gravel and sand, which is being gradually pushed along\r\nthe beds of rivers, and which, in the case of the Mississippi, has been\r\nestimated to equal a mass of seven hundred and fifty million cubic feet,\r\ndischarged annually into the Gulf of Mexico. By careful measurements, it\r\nhas also been ascertained that the same river carries down annually into\r\nthe sea a weight of mud held in suspension which reaches the vast sum of\r\n812,500,000,000 pounds. The total annual amount of mineral matter,\r\nwhether held in suspension or pushed along the bottom of this great\r\nriver, has been estimated to equal a mass 268 feet in height, with an\r\narea of one square mile.\r\n\r\n64. _Alluvium._--The sediment carried along and deposited by a river is\r\ncalled _alluvium_. Sometimes this alluvium covers wide areas, forming\r\nbroad flats on one or both sides of a river, and in such cases it is due\r\nto the action of the floodwaters of the stream. Every time the river\r\noverflows the low grounds through which it passes, a layer of sediment\r\nis laid down, which has the effect of gradually raising the level of the\r\nalluvial tract. By and by a time comes when the river, which has all the\r\nwhile been slowly deepening its channel, is unable to flood the flats,\r\nand thereupon it begins to cut into these, and to form new flats at a\r\nsomewhat lower level. In this way we often observe a series of alluvial\r\nterraces, consisting of gravel, sand, and silt, rising one above another\r\nalong a river valley. Such are the terraces of the Thames and other\r\nrivers in England, and of the Tweed, Clyde, Tay, &c. in Scotland. The\r\ngreat plains through which the Rhine flows between Basel and Bingen, are\r\nalso well-marked examples of alluvial accumulations. There are very few\r\nstreams, indeed, which have not formed such deposits along some portion\r\nof their course.\r\n\r\n65. When a river enters a lake, the motion of the water is of course\r\nchecked, and hence the heavier detritus, such as gravel and coarse sand,\r\nmoves more slowly forward, and at last comes to rest on the bed of the\r\nlake, at no great distance from the mouth of the river. Finer sand and\r\nmud are carried out for some distance further, but eventually they also\r\ncease to move, and sink to the bottom. When the lake is sufficiently\r\nlarge, it catches all or nearly all the matter brought down by the\r\nriver, which, as it issues from the lower end of the lake, is bright and\r\nclear. A well-known example of this phenomenon is that of the Rhone,\r\nwhich enters the Lake of Geneva turbid and muddy, but rushes out quite\r\nclear at the lower end of the lake. Lakes, therefore, are all being\r\nslowly or more rapidly silted up, and this, of course, is most\r\nconspicuous at the points where they are entered by rivers. Thus, at the\r\nhead of the Lake of Geneva, it is manifest that the wide flat through\r\nwhich the river flows before it pours into the lake, has been conquered\r\nby the Rhone from the latter. In the times of the Romans, the lake, as\r\nwe know, extended for more than one mile and a half further up the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n66. _Deltas._--When there are no lakes to intercept fluviatile sediment,\r\nthis latter is borne down to the sea, where it is deposited in precisely\r\nthe same way as in a lake: the heavier detritus comes to rest first, the\r\nfiner sediment being swept out for some distance further. So that, in\r\npassing from the river-mouth outwards, we have at first gravel, which\r\ngradually gets finer and finer until it is replaced by sand, while this\r\nin turn is succeeded by mud and silt. There is this difference, however,\r\nbetween lacustrine and fluvio-marine deposits, that while the former\r\naccumulate in water which is comparatively still, the latter are often\r\nbrought under the influence of waves and currents, and become shifted\r\nand sifted to such a degree that fine and coarse detritus are frequently\r\ncommingled; and there is, therefore, not the same orderly succession of\r\ncoarse and fine materials which characterises lacustrine deposits.\r\nOften, indeed, the currents opposite the mouth of a river are so strong,\r\nthat little or no sediment is permitted to gather there. Usually,\r\nhowever, we find that rivers have succeeded in reclaiming more or less\r\nwide tracts from the dominion of the waves, or at all events have\r\ncumbered the bed of the sea with banks and bars of detritus. The broad\r\nplains formed at the mouth of a river are called _deltas_, from their\r\nresemblance to the Greek letter [Delta]. The deltas of the Nile, Ganges,\r\nand Mississippi are among the most noted. The term _delta_, however, is\r\nnot exclusively applied to fluvio-marine deposits; rivers also form\r\ndeltas in fresh-water lakes. It is usual, however, to restrict the term\r\nto extensive alluvial plains which are intersected by many winding\r\nchannels, due to the rapid bifurcation of the river, which begins to\r\ntake place at the very head of the great flat--that is to say, at the\r\npoint where the river originally entered the sea (or lake).\r\n\r\n67. _Frozen Water._--We have now seen what can be done by the mechanical\r\naction of running water. We have next to consider what modifications are\r\neffected by freezing and frozen water. Water, as every one knows,\r\nexpands in the act of freezing, and in doing so exerts great force. Let\r\nthe reader bear in mind what has been said as to the passage of water\r\nthrough the minute and often invisible pores of rocks, and to its\r\npresence in cracks and crevices after every shower of rain, and he will\r\nreadily see how excessive must be the waste caused by the action of\r\nfrost. The water, to as great a depth as the frost extends, passes into\r\nthe solid state, and in doing so pushes the grains of the rocks asunder,\r\nor wedges out large masses. No sooner does thaw ensue than the water,\r\nbecoming melted, allows the grains of the rock to fall asunder; the\r\nouter skin of the rock, as it were, is disintegrated, and crumbles away,\r\nwhile fragments and masses lose their balance in many cases, and topple\r\ndown. Hence it is, that in all regions where frost acts, the hill-tops\r\nand slopes are covered with angular fragments and debris, and a soil is\r\nreadily formed by the disintegration of the rocks.\r\n\r\nRiver-ice is often a potent agent of geological change. Stones get\r\nfrozen in along the margins of a river, and often debris falls down from\r\ncliff and scaur upon the surface of the ice; when thaw sets in, and the\r\nice breaks up, stones and rubbish are frequently floated for long\r\ndistances, and may even be carried out to sea before their support\r\nfails them, and they sink to the bottom. In some cases, when the ice is\r\nvery thick, it may run aground in a river, and confuse and tumble up the\r\ndeposits gathering at the bottom. Ice sometimes forms upon stones at the\r\nbottom of a river, and floats these off; and this curious action may\r\ntake place even although no ice be forming at the time on the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n68. _Glaciers, Icebergs, and Ice-foot._--In certain mountainous\r\ndistricts, and in arctic and antarctic regions, snow accumulates to such\r\nan extent that its own weight suffices to press the lower portions into\r\nice. Alternate thawing and freezing also aid in the formation of the\r\nice, which soon begins to creep down the mountain-slopes into the\r\nvalleys, where it constitutes what are called _glaciers_ or ice-rivers.\r\nThese great masses of ice attain often a great thickness, and frequently\r\nextend for many miles along the course of a valley. In the Alps they\r\noccasionally reach as much as five hundred or six hundred feet in depth.\r\nIn Greenland, however, there are glaciers probably not less than five\r\nthousand feet thick; and the glacier ice of the antarctic continent has\r\nbeen estimated even to reach twelve miles in thickness. Glaciers flow\r\nslowly down their valleys, at a rate which varies with the slope of\r\ntheir beds and the mass of the ice. Some move only a few inches, others\r\ntwo or three feet, in a day. Their forward motion is arrested at a point\r\nwhere the ice is melted just as fast as it comes on. A glacier is always\r\nmore or less seamed with yawning cracks, which are called _crevasses_.\r\nThese owe their origin to the unequal rate at which the different parts\r\nof the ice flow; this differential motion causing strains, to which the\r\nice yields by snapping asunder. The flanks of a glacier are usually\r\nfringed with heaps of angular blocks and debris which fall from the\r\nadjacent rocky slopes, and some of this rubbish tumbling into the gaping\r\ncrevasses must occasionally reach to the bottom of the ice. The rubbish\r\nheaps (_superficial moraines_) travel slowly down the valley on the\r\nsurface of the ice, and are eventually toppled over the end of the\r\nglacier, where they form great banks and mounds. These are called\r\n_terminal moraines_. The rocky bed of a glacier is invariably smoothed\r\nand polished, and streaked with coarse and fine _striae_, or scratches,\r\nwhich run parallel to the direction of the ice-flow. These are due to\r\nthe presence, at the bottom of the ice, of such angular fragments as\r\nbecome detached from the underlying rocks, or of boulders and rubbish\r\nwhich have been introduced from above. The stones are ground by the ice\r\nalong the surface of its bed, causing ruts and scratches, while the\r\nfiner material resulting from the grinding action forms a kind of\r\npolisher. The stones acting as gravers are themselves covered with\r\nstriae, and their sharp edges get smoothed away. In alpine districts\r\nthere is always a good deal of water circulating underneath a glacier,\r\nand this washes out the sand and fine clay. Thus it is that rivers\r\nissuing from glaciers are always more or less discoloured brown, yellow,\r\ngreen, gray, or blue, according to the nature of the rocks which the ice\r\nhas pounded down into mud. In Greenland many of the large glaciers go\r\nright out to sea, and owing to their great thickness are able to\r\ndispossess the sea sometimes for miles. But erelong the greater specific\r\ngravity of the sea-water forces off large segments from the terminal\r\nfront of the ice, which float away as _icebergs_. Large masses are also\r\nalways falling down from the ice-front. Occasionally, big blocks and\r\ndebris are floated away on the icebergs, but this does not appear to be\r\ncommon. In Greenland there is very little rock-surface exposed, from\r\nwhich blocks can be showered down upon the glaciers, and the surface of\r\nthe latter is therefore generally free from superficial moraines. A kind\r\nof submarine terminal moraine, however, gathers in front of some\r\nglaciers, made up chiefly of the stones and rubbish that are dragged\r\nalong underneath the ice, and exposed by the breaking-off of icebergs,\r\nbut partly composed also of the sand and mud washed out by sub-glacial\r\nwaters. A narrow belt of ice forms along the sea-coast in arctic\r\nregions, which often attains a thickness of thirty or forty feet. This\r\nis called the _ice-foot_. It becomes loaded with debris and blocks,\r\nwhich fall upon it from the cliffs above; and, as large portions are\r\nfrequently detached from the cliffs in summer-time, they sail off with\r\ntheir cargoes of debris, and drop these over the sea-bottom as they\r\ngradually melt away. The ice-foot is the great distributor of _erratics_\r\nor wandered blocks, the part taken in this action by the huge icebergs\r\nwhich are discharged by the glaciers being, comparatively speaking,\r\ninsignificant. But when these latter run aground, they must often cause\r\ngreat confusion among the beds of fine material accumulating upon the\r\nfloor of the sea.\r\n\r\n69. _The Sea._--Sea-water owes its saltness to the presence of various\r\nmore or less soluble substances, such as _common salt_, _gypsum_, _Epsom\r\nsalts_, _chloride of magnesium_, &c. Besides these, there are other\r\ningredients held in solution, which, although they can be detected in\r\nonly minute quantities in sea-water, are yet of the very utmost\r\nimportance to marine creatures. This is the case with _carbonate of\r\nlime_, vast quantities of which are carried down by many rivers to the\r\nsea. But it must be nearly all used up in the formation of hard shells\r\nand skeletons by molluscs, crustaceans, corals, &c., for very little can\r\nbe traced in the water itself. _Silica_ is also met with sparingly, and\r\nis abstracted by some creatures to form their hard coverings.\r\n\r\n70. _Breaker-action--Currents._--The most conspicuous action of the sea,\r\nas a geological agent, takes place along its margin, where the breakers\r\nare hurled against the land. Stones and gravel are borne with more or\r\nless intense force against the rocks, and by their constant battering\r\nsucceed eventually in undermining the cliffs, which by and by become\r\ntop-heavy, and large masses fall down and get broken up and pounded into\r\ngravel and sand. The new wall of rock thus exposed becomes in turn\r\nassaulted, and in course of time is undermined in like manner. The waste\r\nof the cliffs is greatly aided by the action of frost, which loosens the\r\njointed rocks, and renders them an easier prey to the force of the\r\nwaves. Of course, the rapidity with which a coast-line is eaten into\r\ndepends very much upon the nature of the rocks. Where these are formed\r\nof loose materials like sand, gravel, or clay, considerable inroads are\r\neffected by the sea in a comparatively short time. Thus, along some\r\nparts of the English coast, as between Flamborough Head and the mouth of\r\nthe Humber, and between the Wash and the Thames, it is estimated that\r\nthe land is wasted away at the rate of a yard per annum. Where hard\r\nrocks form the coast-line the rate of waste is often exceedingly slow,\r\nand centuries may elapse without any apparent change being effected.\r\nWhen the rocks are of unequal hardness the coast-line becomes very\r\nirregular, the sea carving out bays and gullies in the softer portions,\r\nwhile the more durable masses stand out as capes and bold headlands. Not\r\nunfrequently, such headlands are converted into sea-stacks and rocky\r\nislets, as one may observe along the rockier parts of our shore-lines.\r\nClose inshore, the bulkier debris derived from the waste of the land\r\noften accumulates, forming beds and banks of shingle and gravel. The\r\nfiner materials are carried farther out to sea, and distributed over the\r\nsea-floor by the action of the tide and currents. Tidal and other\r\ncurrents may also have some denuding effect upon the sea-bottom, but\r\nthis can only be in comparatively shallow water. The great bulk of the\r\nmaterial derived from the waste of the coasts by the mechanical action\r\nof the breakers, travels for no great distance. But the fine mud brought\r\ndown by rivers is frequently transported for vast distances before it\r\nsettles. So fine, indeed, is some of this sedimentary material, that it\r\nmay be carried in suspension by sea-currents for thousands of miles\r\nbefore it sinks to the bottom.\r\n\r\n71. From this short outline it becomes evident, therefore, that the\r\ncoarser-grained the deposit, the smaller will be the area it covers;\r\nwhile conversely, the finer the accumulation, the more widely will it be\r\ndistributed. A partial exception to this rule is that of the debris\r\nscattered over the bottom of the ocean by icebergs and detached portions\r\nof ice-foot. These are often floated for vast distances by currents\r\nbefore they finally melt away, and hence the coarse debris transported\r\nby them must be very widely distributed over that part of the sea-bottom\r\nwhich is traversed by currents flowing out of the Arctic and Antarctic\r\nOceans. Although the deeper recesses of the ocean appear to be covered\r\nonly with ooze and fine mud, yet in some instances coarse sand, and even\r\nsmall stones, have been brought up from depths of a hundred fathoms, so\r\nthat currents may occasionally carry coarser materials for great\r\ndistances from the shore. The shifting action of tidal currents succeeds\r\nin giving rise to very irregular deposits in shallow seas. The\r\nsoundings often shew sudden changes from gravel to sand and mud, nor can\r\nthere be any doubt that, could we lay bare the sea-bottom, we should\r\noften observe gravel shading off into sand, and sand into mud, and _vice\r\nversa_. But as we receded from the shore, and approached areas which\r\nwere once deeply submerged, we should find that the change of material\r\nwas generally from coarse to fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL ACTION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n72. _Plants._--The disintegration of rocks is often aided by the\r\naction of plants, which force their roots into joints and crevices,\r\nand thus loosen blocks and fragments. Carbonic acid, derived from the\r\ndecay of plants, being absorbed by rain-water, acts chemically upon\r\nmany rocks, as in the case of limestone (see 59, 60, 61). In temperate\r\nregions, vegetation frequently accumulates, under certain conditions,\r\nto form very considerable masses. Of such a nature is _peat_, which,\r\nas is well known, covers many thousands of acres in the British\r\nIslands. This substance is composed fundamentally of the bog-moss\r\n(_Sphagnum palustre_), with which, however, are usually associated\r\nmany other marsh-loving plants. The lower parts of bog-moss die and\r\ndecay while its upper portions continue to flourish, and thus, in\r\nprocess of time, a thickness of peat is accumulated to the extent of\r\nsix, twelve, twenty-four, or even forty feet. Many of the hill-tops\r\nand hill-slopes in Scotland and Ireland are covered with a few feet of\r\npeat, but it is only in valleys and hollows where the peat-bogs attain\r\ntheir greatest depth. In not a few cases, the bogs seem to occupy the\r\nsites of ancient lakes, shell-marl often occurring at the bottom of\r\nthese. The trunks and roots of trees are also commonly met with\r\nunderneath peat, and occasionally the remains of land animals.\r\nFrequently, indeed, it would seem as if the overthrow of the trees, by\r\nobstructing the drainage of the country, had given rise to a marsh,\r\nand the consequent formation of peat. Some of the most valuable peat\r\nclosely resembles lignite, and makes a good fuel. In tropical\r\ncountries, the rapidity with which vegetation decays prevents, as a\r\nrule, any great accumulation taking place; but the mangrove swamps are\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\n73. _Animals._--The action of animal life is for the most part\r\nconservative and reconstructive. Considerable accumulations of\r\nshell-marl take place in fresh-water lakes, and the flat bottoms which\r\nmark the sites of lakes which have been drained are frequently dug to\r\nobtain this material. But by far the most conspicuous formations due\r\nto the action of animal life accumulate in the sea. Molluscs,\r\ncrustaceans, corals, and the like, secrete from the ocean the\r\ncarbonate of lime of which their hard shells and skeletons are\r\ncomposed, and these hard parts go to the formation of limestone. The\r\nmost remarkable masses of modern limestone occur within intertropical\r\nregions. These are the coral reefs of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 24.--Formation of Coral Reefs.]\r\n\r\n74. _Coral_ is the calcareous skeleton of certain small soft-bodied\r\ngelatinous animals called _actinozoa_. These zoophytes flourish only in\r\nclear water, the temperature of which is not below 66 deg. F., and they\r\ncannot live at greater depths than one hundred feet. There are three\r\nkinds of coral reef--namely, _fringing_ reefs, _barrier_ reefs, and\r\n_atolls_. Fringing reefs occur, as a rule, near to the shore; but if\r\nthis latter be gently sloping, they may extend for one or even two miles\r\nout to sea; as far, indeed, as the depth of water is not too great for\r\nthe actinozoa. Barrier reefs are met with at greater distances from the\r\nland, and often rise from profound depths. The barrier reef which\r\nextends along the north-east coast of Australia, often at a distance\r\nfrom the land of fifty or sixty miles, stretches, with interruptions,\r\nfor about 1250 miles, with a breadth varying from ten to ninety miles.\r\nIn some places, the depth of the sea immediately outside of this reef\r\nexceeds 1800 feet. Sometimes barrier reefs completely encircle an island\r\nor islands, which are usually mountainous, as in the case of Pouynipete,\r\nan island in the Caroline Archipelago, and the Gambier Islands in the\r\nLow Archipelago. _Atolls_ are more or less irregular ring-shaped reefs\r\ninclosing a lagoon of quiet water. They usually rise from profound\r\ndepths; Keeling Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, is a good example. The upper\r\nsurface of atolls and barrier reefs often peers at separate points above\r\nthe level of the sea, so as to form low-lying islets. In some cases, the\r\nland thus formed is almost co-extensive with the reef, and being clothed\r\nwith palms and tropical verdure, resembles a beautiful chaplet floating,\r\nas it were, in mid-ocean. The rock of a coral reef is a solid white\r\nlimestone, similar in composition to that of the limestones occurring in\r\nthis country. In some places, it is quite compact, shewing few or no\r\ninclosed shells or other animal remains; in other places, it is made up\r\nof broken and comminuted corals cemented together, or of masses of coral\r\nstanding as they slowly grew, with the spaces between the separate\r\nclumps filled up with coral sand and triturated fragments and grit of\r\ncoral and shell. The thickness of the reefs is often very great,\r\nreaching in many cases to thousands of feet. At the Fijis, the reef can\r\nhardly be less than 2000 or 3000 feet thick. Below a depth of one\r\nhundred feet, all the coral rock is dead, and since the coral zoophytes\r\ndo not live at greater depths than this, it follows that the bed of the\r\nsea in which coral reefs occur must have slowly subsided during a long\r\ncourse of ages. Mr Darwin was the first to give a reasonable explanation\r\nof the origin of coral reefs. Briefly stated, his explanation is as\r\nfollows: The corals began to grow first in water not exceeding one\r\nhundred feet in depth, and built up to the surface of the sea, thus\r\nforming a fringing reef at no great distance from the land. This initial\r\nstep is shewn at A, B, in the accompanying section across a coral\r\nisland. A, A, are the outer edges of the fringing reef; B, B, the shores\r\nof the island; and S1 the level of the sea. Subsidence ensuing, the\r\nisland and the sea-bottom sink slowly down, while the coral animals\r\ncontinue to grow to the surface--the building of the reef keeping pace\r\nwith the subsidence. By and by the island sinks to the level S2, when\r\nB', B', represent the shores of the now diminished island, and A', A',\r\nthe outer edges of the reef, which has become a barrier reef; C, C,\r\nbeing the lagoon between the reef and the central island. We have now\r\nonly to suppose a continuance of the submergence to the level S3, when\r\nthe island disappears, its site being occupied by a lagoon, C'--the\r\nreef, which has at the same time become an atoll, being shewn at A'',\r\nA''.\r\n\r\n75. In extra-tropical latitudes, great accumulations of carbonate of\r\nlime are also taking place. The bottom of the Atlantic has been found to\r\nbe covered, over vast areas, by a fine calcareous sticky deposit called\r\n_ooze_, which would appear to consist for the most part of the skeletons\r\nof minute animal organisms, called Foraminifera. This accumulation, when\r\ndried, closely resembled chalk, and there can be no doubt that in the\r\ndeep recesses of the Atlantic we have thus a gradually increasing\r\ndeposit of carbonate of lime, which rivals, if it does not exceed, in\r\nextent the most widely spread calcareous rocks with which we are\r\nacquainted. A small percentage of siliceous materials occurs in the\r\nooze, made up partly of granules of quartz, and partly of the skeletons\r\nand coverings of minute animal and vegetable organisms. When in process\r\nof time the chemical forces begin to act upon the siliceous matter\r\ndiffused through the Atlantic ooze, _segregation_, or the gathering\r\ntogether of the particles, may take place, and nodules of flint will be\r\nthe result, similar to the flint nodules which occur in chalk, and the\r\ncherty concretions in limestones. Animalcules with siliceous envelopes\r\nand skeletons are by no means so abundant as those that secrete\r\ncarbonate of lime, but they are very widely diffused through the oceans,\r\nand in favourable places are so abundant that they may well give rise\r\neventually to extensive beds of flint. Ehrenberg calculated that 17,946\r\ncubic feet of these organisms were formed annually in the muddy bottom\r\nof the harbour at Wismar, in the Baltic.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from recent observations (_Challenger_ expedition) that\r\nthe calcareous ooze at the bottom of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans,\r\nwhich occurs at a mean depth of 2250 fathoms, passes gradually as the\r\nocean deepens into a gray ooze, which is less calcareous, and which\r\noccurs at a mean depth of 2400 fathoms. At still greater depths this\r\ngray ooze also disappears, and is replaced by red clay at a mean depth\r\nof 2700 fathoms. The minute creatures (foraminifera and pelagic\r\nmollusca chiefly) whose shells go to form the calcareous ooze, live for\r\nthe most part on the surface, and swarm all over the areas in which ooze\r\nand red clay occur at the bottom. Hence it seems probable that the clay\r\nis merely the insoluble residue or _ash_, as it were, of the\r\norganisms--the delicate shells, as they slowly sink to the more profound\r\ndepths, being dissolved by the free carbonic acid, which, as\r\nobservations would seem to shew, occurs rather in excess at great\r\ndepths. Thus we see how the organic forces may give rise to extensive\r\naccumulations of inorganic matter, closely resembling the finest silt or\r\nmud which is carried down to the sea by rivers, and distributed far and\r\nwide by ocean currents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBTERRANEAN FORCES.\r\n\r\n76. There have been many speculations as to the condition of the\r\ninterior of the earth. Some have inferred that the external crust of the\r\nglobe incloses a fluid or molten mass; others think it more probable\r\nthat the interior is solid, but contains scattered throughout its bulk,\r\nespecially towards the surface of the earth, irregular seas of molten\r\nmatter, occupying large vesicles or tunnels in the solid honey-combed\r\nmass. At present, the facts known would appear to be best explained by\r\nthe latter hypothesis. All that we know from observation is, that the\r\ntemperature increases as we descend from the surface. The rate of\r\nincrease is very variable. Thus, in the Artesian well at Neuffen, in\r\nWuertemberg, it was as much as 1 deg. F. for every 19 feet. In the mines of\r\nCentral Germany, however, the increase is only 1 deg. F. for every 76 feet;\r\nwhile in the Dukinfield coal-pit, near Manchester, the increase was\r\nstill less, being only 1 deg. F. in 89 feet. Taking the average of many\r\nobservations, it may be held as pretty well proved that the temperature\r\nof the earth's crust increases 1 deg. for every 50 or 60 feet of descent\r\nafter the first hundred.\r\n\r\n77. The crust of the earth is subject to certain movements, which are\r\neither sudden and paroxysmal, or protracted and tranquil. The former are\r\nknown as earthquakes, which may or may not result in a permanent\r\nalteration of the relative level of land and sea; the latter always\r\neffect some permanent change, either of upheaval or depression.\r\n\r\n78. _Earthquakes_ have been variously accounted for. Those who uphold\r\nthe hypothesis of a fluid interior think the undulatory motion\r\nexperienced at the surface is caused by movements in the underlying\r\nmolten mass--an earthquake being thus 'the reaction of the liquid\r\nnucleus against the outer crust.' By others, again, earthquakes are\r\nsupposed to be caused by the fall of large rock-masses from the roofs of\r\nsubterranean cavities, or by any sudden impulse or blow, such as might\r\nbe produced by the cracking of rocks in a state of tension, by a sudden\r\nvolcanic outburst, or sudden generation or condensation of steam. In\r\nsupport of this latter hypothesis, many facts may be adduced. The\r\nundulatory motion communicated to the ground during gunpowder\r\nexplosions, or by the fall of rocks from a mountain, is often propagated\r\nto great distances from the scene of these catastrophes, and the\r\nphenomena closely resemble those which accompany a true earthquake. When\r\nthe level of a district has been permanently affected by an earthquake,\r\nthe movement has generally resulted in a lowering of the surface. Thus,\r\nin 1819, the Great Runn of Cutch, in Hindustan, was depressed over an\r\narea of several thousand square miles, so as during the monsoons to\r\nbecome a salt lagoon. Occasionally, however, we find that elevation of\r\nthe land has taken place during an earthquake. This was the case in New\r\nZealand in 1855, when the ground on which the town of Wellington stands\r\nrose about two feet, and a cape in the neighbourhood nearly ten feet.\r\nSometimes the ground so elevated is, after a shorter or longer period,\r\nagain depressed to its former level. A good example of this occurred in\r\nSouth America in 1835. The shore at Concepcion was raised a yard and a\r\nhalf; and the Isle Santa Maria was pushed up two and a half yards at one\r\nend, and three and a half yards at the other. But only a few months\r\nafterwards the ground sank again, and everything returned to its old\r\nposition. The heaving and undulatory motion of an earthquake produces\r\nfrequently considerable changes at the surface of the ground, besides an\r\nalteration of level. Rocks are loosened, and sometimes hurled down from\r\ncliff and mountain-side, and streams are occasionally dammed with the\r\nsoil and rubbish pitched into them. Sometimes also the ground opens, and\r\nswallows whatever chances to come in the way. If these chasms close\r\nagain permanently, no change in the physiography of the land may take\r\nplace, but sometimes they remain open, and affect the drainage of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n79. _Movements of Upheaval and Depression._--Besides the permanent\r\nalteration of level which is sometimes the result of a great earthquake,\r\nit is now well known that the crust of the earth is subject to\r\nlong-continued and tranquil movements of elevation and depression. The\r\ncause of these movements is at present merely matter for speculation,\r\nsome being of opinion that they may be caused by the gradual contraction\r\nof the slowly cooling nucleus of the earth, which would necessarily give\r\nrise to depression, while this movement, again, would be accompanied by\r\nsome degree of elevation--the result of the lateral push or thrust\r\neffected by the descending rock-masses. It is doubtful, however, if this\r\nhypothesis will explain all the appearances. The Scandinavian peninsula\r\naffords a fine example of the movements in question. At the extremity of\r\nthe peninsula (Scania), the land is slowly sinking, while to the north\r\nof that district gradual elevation is taking place at a very variable\r\nrate, which in some places reaches as much as two or three feet in a\r\ncentury. Movements of elevation are also affecting Spitzbergen, Northern\r\nSiberia, North Greenland, the whole western borders of South America,\r\nJapan, the Kurile Islands, Asia Minor, and many other districts in the\r\nMediterranean area, besides various islets in the great Pacific Ocean.\r\nThe proofs of a slow movement of elevation are found in old\r\n_sea-beaches_ and _sea-caves_, which now stand above the level of the\r\nsea. In the case of Scandinavia, it has been noticed that the pine-woods\r\nwhich clothe the mountains are being slowly elevated to ungenial\r\nheights, and are therefore gradually dying out along their upper limits.\r\nThe proofs of depression of the land are seen in submerged forests and\r\npeat, which occur frequently around our own shores, and there is also\r\nstrong human testimony to such downward movements of the surface. The\r\ncase of Scania has already been referred to. Several streets in some of\r\nits coast towns have sunk below the sea, and it is calculated that the\r\nScanian coast has lost to the extent of thirty-two yards in breadth\r\nwithin the past hundred and thirty years. The coral reefs of southern\r\noceans also afford striking evidence of a great movement of depression.\r\n\r\nNot long ago a theory was started by a French savant, M. Adhemar, to\r\naccount for changes in the sea-level, without having recourse to\r\nsubterranean agency. He pointed out that a vast ice-cap, covering the\r\nnorthern regions of our hemisphere, as was certainly the case during\r\nwhat is termed the glacial epoch, would cause a rise of the sea by\r\ndisplacing the earth's centre of gravity. Mr James Croll has recently\r\nstrongly supported this opinion; and there can be no doubt that we have\r\nhere a _vera causa_ of considerable mutations of level. It is\r\nunquestionably true, however, that great oscillatory movements, such as\r\ndescribed above, and which can only be attributed to subterranean\r\nagencies, have frequently taken and are still taking place.\r\n\r\n80. Such movements of the earth's crust cannot take place without\r\neffecting some change upon the strata of which that crust is composed.\r\nDuring _depression_ of the curved surface of the earth, the under strata\r\nmust necessarily be subjected to intense lateral pressure, since they\r\nare compelled to occupy less space, and contortion and plication will be\r\nthe result. It is evident also that contortion will diminish from below\r\nupwards, so that we can conceive that excessive contortion may be even\r\nnow taking place at a great depth from the surface in Greenland. During\r\na movement of _elevation_, on the other hand, the strata are subjected\r\nto excessive tension, and must be seamed with great rents: when the\r\nelevating force is removed, the disrupted rocks will settle down\r\nunequally--in other words, they will be _faulted_, and their continuity\r\nwill be broken. But both contortion and faulting may be due, on a small\r\nscale, to local causes, such as the intrusion of igneous rocks, the\r\nconsolidation of strata, the falling in of old water-courses, &c.\r\n_Cleavage_ is believed to have been caused by compression, such as the\r\nrocks might well be subjected to during great movements of the earth's\r\ncrust. The particles of which the rock is composed are compressed in one\r\ndirection, and of course are at the same time drawn out at right angles\r\nto the pressure. This is observed not only as regards the particles of\r\nthe rock themselves, but imbedded fossils also are distorted and\r\nflattened in precisely the same way.\r\n\r\n81. _Volcanoes._--Besides movements of elevation and depression, there\r\nare certain other phenomena due to the action of the subterranean\r\nforces. Such are the ejection from the interior of the earth of heated\r\nmatters, and their accumulation upon the surface. The erupted materials\r\nconsist of molten matter (lava), stones and dust, gases and steam--the\r\nlava, ashes, and stones gradually accumulating round the focus of\r\nejection, and thus tending to form a conical hill or mountain. Could we\r\nobtain a complete section of such a volcanic cone, we should find it\r\nbuilt up of successive irregular beds of lava, and layers of stones and\r\nashes, dipping outwards and away from the source of eruption, but having\r\nround the walls of the _crater_ (that is, the cavity at the summit of\r\nthe truncated cone) a more or less perceptible dip inwards. Fig. 25\r\ngives a condensed view of the general phenomena accompanying an\r\neruption. In this ideal section, _a_ is the funnel or neck of the\r\nvolcano filled with lava; _b_, _b_, the crater. The molten lava is\r\nhighly charged with elastic fluids, which continually escape from its\r\nsurface with violent explosions, and rise in globular clouds, _d_, _d_,\r\nto a certain height, after which they dilate into a dark cloud, _c_.\r\nFrom this cloud showers of rain, _e_, are frequently discharged. Large\r\nand small portions of the incandescent lava are shot upwards as the\r\nimprisoned vapour of water explodes and makes its escape, and, along\r\nwith these, fragments of the rocks forming the walls of the crater and\r\nthe funnel are also violently discharged; the cooled bombs, angular\r\nstones, and _lapilli_, as the smaller stones are called, falling in\r\nshowers, _f_, upon the exterior parts of the cone or into the crater,\r\nfrom which they are again and again ejected. Most frequently the great\r\nweight of the lava inside the crater suffices to break down the side of\r\nthe cone, and the molten rock escapes through the breach. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, it issues from beneath the base of the cone. At other times,\r\nfinding for itself some weak place in the cone, it may flow out by a\r\nlateral fissure, _g_. In the diagram, _i_, _i_ represents the lava\r\nstreaming down the outward slopes, jets of steam and fumaroles escaping\r\nfrom almost every part of its surface. Forked lightning often\r\naccompanies an eruption, and is supposed to be generated by the intense\r\nmutual friction in the air of the ejected stones. The trituration to\r\nwhich these are subjected reduces them, first, to a kind of coarse\r\ngravel (_lapillo_); then to sand (_puzzolana_); and lastly, to fine dust\r\nor ashes (_ceneri_).\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Fig. 25.--Diagrammatic Section of Volcano.]\r\n\r\n82. _Lava._--Any rock which has been erupted from a volcano in a molten\r\nstate is called _lava_. Some modern lava-streams cover a great extent of\r\nsurface. One of two streams which issued from the volcano of Skaptur\r\nJokul (Iceland) in 1783 overflowed an area fifty miles in length, with a\r\nbreadth in places of fifteen; the other was not much less extensive,\r\nbeing forty miles in length, with an occasional breadth of seven. In\r\nsome places the lava exceeded 500 feet in thickness. Again, in 1855, an\r\neruption in the island of Hawaii sent forth a stream of lava sixty-five\r\nmiles long, and from one to ten miles wide. The surface of a stream\r\nquickly cools and consolidates, and in doing so shrinks, so as to become\r\nseamed with cracks, through which the incandescent matter underneath can\r\nbe seen. As the current flows on, the upper crust separates into rough\r\nragged scoriform blocks, which are rolled over each other and jammed\r\ninto confused masses. The slags that cake upon the face or front of the\r\nstream roll down before it, and thus a kind of rude pavement is formed,\r\nupon which the lava advances and is eventually consolidated. Thus, in\r\nmost cases, a bed of lava is scoriaceous as well below as above. Other\r\nkinds of lava are much more ductile and viscous, and coagulate\r\nsuperficially in glossy or wrinkled crusts. When lava has inclosed\r\nfragments of aqueous rocks, such as limestone, clay, or sandstone, these\r\nare observed to have undergone some alteration. The sandstone is often\r\nmuch hardened, the clay is porcelainised, and the limestone, still\r\nretaining its carbonic acid, assumes a crystalline texture. But the\r\naqueous rock upon which lava has cooled does not usually exhibit much\r\nchange, nor does the alteration, as a rule, extend more than a few feet\r\n(often only a few inches) into the rock. A lava-current which entered a\r\nlake or the sea, however, has sometimes caught up much of the sediment\r\ngathering there, and become so commingled with it, that in some parts it\r\nis hard to say whether the resulting rock is more igneous or aqueous.\r\nLava which has been squirted up from below into cracks and crevices, and\r\nthere consolidated so as to form _dykes_, sometimes, but not often,\r\nproduces considerable alteration upon the rocks which it intersects. The\r\nbasaltic structure is believed to be due to the contraction of lava\r\nconsequent upon its cooling. The axes of the prisms are always\r\nperpendicular to the cooling surface or surfaces, and in some cases the\r\ncolumns are wonderfully regular. There are numerous varieties of lava,\r\nsuch as _basalt_, _obsidian_, _pitchstone_, _pearlstone_, _trachyte_,\r\n&c.; some are heavy compact rocks, others are light and porous. Many are\r\nfinely or coarsely crystalline; others have a glassy and resinous or\r\nwaxy texture. Some shew a flaky or laminated structure; others are\r\nconcretionary. Most of the lava rocks, however, are granularly\r\ncrystalline. In many, a vesicular character is observed. These vesicles,\r\nbeing due to the bubbles of vapour that gathered in the molten rock,\r\nusually occur in greatest abundance towards the upper surface of a bed\r\nof lava. They are also more or less well developed near the bottom of a\r\nbed, which, as already explained, is frequently scoriaceous.\r\nOccasionally the vesicles are disseminated throughout the entire rock.\r\nAs a rule, those lavas which are of inferior specific gravity are much\r\nmore vesicular than the denser and heavier varieties. The vesicles are\r\nusually more or less flattened, having been drawn out in the direction\r\nin which the lava-current flowed. Sometimes they are filled, or\r\npartially filled, with mineral matter introduced at the time of\r\neruption, or subsequently brought in a state of solution and deposited\r\nthere by water filtering through the rock: this forms what is called\r\n_amygdaloidal lava_. In volcanic districts, the rocks are often\r\ntraversed by more or less vertical dykes or veins of igneous matter.\r\nThese dykes appear in some cases to have been formed by the filling up\r\nof crevices from above--the liquid lava having filtered downwards from\r\nan overflowing mass. In most cases, however, the lava has been injected\r\nfrom below, and not unfrequently the 'dykes' seem to have been the\r\nfeeders from which lava-streams have been supplied--the feeders having\r\nnow become exposed to the light of day either by some violent eruption\r\nwhich has torn the rocks asunder, or else by the gradual wearing away of\r\nthe latter by atmospheric and aqueous agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHISM.\r\n\r\n83. Mention has already been made of the fact, that the heated matters\r\nejected from volcanoes, or forcibly intruded into cracks, crevices, &c.,\r\noccasionally _alter_ the rocks with which they come in contact. When\r\nthis alteration has proceeded so far as to induce a crystalline or\r\nsemi-crystalline character, the rock so altered is said to be\r\nmetamorphosed. Metamorphism has likewise been produced by the chemical\r\naction of percolating water, which frequently dissolves out certain\r\nminerals, and replaces these with others having often a very different\r\nchemical composition. But metamorphism on the large scale--that is to\r\nsay, metamorphism which has affected wide areas, such as the northern\r\nHighlands of Scotland and wide regions in Scandinavia, or the still\r\nvaster areas in North America--has most probably been effected both by\r\nthe agency of heat and chemical action, at considerable depths, and\r\nunder great pressure. When we observe what effect can be produced by\r\nheat upon rocks, under little or no pressure, and how water percolating\r\nfrom above gradually changes the composition of some rock-masses, we may\r\nreadily believe that at great depths, where the heat is excessive, such\r\nmetamorphic action must often be intensified. Thus, for example,\r\nlimestone heated in the usual way gives off its carbonic acid gas, and\r\nis reduced to quicklime; but, under sufficient pressure, this gas is not\r\nevolved, the limestone becoming converted into a crystalline marble.\r\nSome crystalline limestones, indeed, have all the appearance of having\r\nat one time been actually melted and squirted under great pressure into\r\nseams and cracks of the surrounding strata. Heated water would appear to\r\nhave been the agent to which much of the metamorphism which affects the\r\nrocky strata must be attributed. But the mode or modes in which it has\r\nacted are still somewhat obscure; as may be readily understood when it\r\nis remembered how difficult, and often how impossible it is to realise\r\nor reproduce in our laboratories the conditions under which deep-seated\r\nmetamorphic action must frequently have taken place. In foliated rocks,\r\nthe minerals are chiefly quartz, felspar, and mica, talc, or chlorite.\r\nThe ingredients of these minerals undoubtedly existed in a diffused\r\nstate in the original rocks, and heated water charged with alkaline\r\ncarbonates, as it percolated through the strata, either along the\r\nlayers of bedding or lines of cleavage, slowly acted upon these,\r\ndissolving and redepositing them, and thus inducing segregation. There\r\nis every kind of gradation in metamorphism. Thus, we find certain rocks\r\nwhich are but slightly altered--their original character being still\r\nquite apparent; while, in other cases, the original character is so\r\nentirely effaced that we can only conjecture what that may have been.\r\nWhen we have a considerable thickness of metamorphic rocks which still\r\nexhibit more or less distinct traces of bedding, like the successive\r\nbeds of gneiss, mica-schist, and quartz rock of the Scottish Highlands,\r\nwe can hardly doubt that the now crystalline masses are merely highly\r\naltered aqueous strata. But there are cases where even the bedding\r\nbecomes obliterated, and it is then much more difficult to determine the\r\norigin of the rocks. Thus, we find bedded gneiss passes often, by\r\ninsensible gradations, into true amorphous granite. There has been much\r\ndifference of opinion as to the origin of granite--some holding it to be\r\nan igneous rock, others maintaining its metamorphic origin. It is\r\nprobably both igneous and metamorphic, however. If we conceive of\r\ncertain aqueous rocks becoming metamorphosed into gneiss, we may surely\r\nconceive of the metamorphism being still further continued until the\r\nmass is reduced to a semi-fluid or pasty condition, when all trace of\r\nfoliation and bedding might readily disappear, and the weight of the\r\nsuperincumbent strata would be sufficient to force portions of the\r\nsoftened mass into cracks and crevices of the still solid rocks above\r\nand around it. Hence we might expect to find the same mass of granite\r\npassing gradually in some places into gneiss, and in other places\r\nprotruding as _veins_ and _dykes_ into the surrounding rocks; and this\r\nis precisely what occurs in nature.\r\n\r\n84. _Mineral veins_ have, as a rule, been formed by water depositing\r\nalong the walls of fissures the various matters which they held in\r\nsolution, but certain kinds of veins (such as quartz veins in granite)\r\nprobably owe their origin to chemical action which has induced the\r\nquartz to segregate from the rock mass. Some have maintained that the\r\nmetallic substances met with in many veins owe their deposition to the\r\naction of currents of voltaic electricity; while others have attributed\r\ntheir presence to sublimation from below, the metals having been\r\ndeposited in the fissures very much as lead is deposited in the chimney\r\nof a leadmill. But in many cases there seems little reason to doubt that\r\nthe ores have merely been extracted from the rocks, and re-deposited in\r\nfissures, by water, in the same way as the other minerals with which\r\nthey are associated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n85. _Denudation._--By the combined action of all the geological agencies\r\nwhich have been described in the preceding sections, the earth has\r\nacquired its present diversified surface. Valleys, lacustrine hollows,\r\ntable-lands, and mountains have all been more or less slowly formed by\r\nthe forces which we see even now at work in the world around us. When we\r\nreflect upon the fact that all the inclined strata which crop out at the\r\nsurface of the ground are but the truncated portions of beds that were\r\nonce continuous, and formed complete anticlinal arches or curves, we\r\nmust be impressed with the degree of _denudation_, or wearing-away,\r\nwhich the solid strata have experienced. If we protract in imagination\r\nthe outcrop of a given set of strata, we shall find them curving upwards\r\ninto the air to a height of, it may be, hundreds or even thousands of\r\nfeet, before they roll over to come down and fit on to the truncated\r\nends of the beds on the further side of the anticline (see figs. 9 and\r\n11, pages 33, 34). _Dislocations_ or _faults_ afford further striking\r\nevidence in the same direction. Sometimes these have displaced the\r\nstrata for hundreds and even thousands of feet--that is to say, that a\r\nbed occurring at, for example, a few feet from the surface upon one side\r\nof a fault, has sunk hundreds or thousands of feet on the other side.\r\nYet it often happens that there is no irregularity at the surface to\r\nbetray the existence of a dislocation. The ground may be flat as a\r\nbowling-green, and yet, owing to some great fault, the rocks underneath\r\none end of the flat may be geologically many hundred feet, or even\r\nyards, higher or lower than the strata underneath the other end of the\r\nsame level space. What has become of the missing strata? They have been\r\ncarried away grain by grain by the denuding forces--by weathering, rain,\r\nfrost, and fluviatile and marine action. The whole surface of a country\r\nis exposed to the abrading action of the subaerial forces, and has been\r\ncarved by them into hills and valleys, the position of which depends\r\npartly upon the geological structure of the country, and partly upon the\r\ntexture and composition of the rocks. The original slope of the surface,\r\nwhen it was first elevated out of the sea, would be determined by the\r\naction of the subterraneous forces--the dominant parts, whether\r\ntable-lands or undulating ridges, forming the centres from which the\r\nwaters would begin to flow. After the land had been subjected for many\r\nlong ages to the wearing action of the denuding agents, it is evident\r\nthat the softer rocks--those which were least capable of withstanding\r\nweathering and erosion--would be more worn away than the less easily\r\ndecomposed masses. The latter would, therefore, tend to form elevations,\r\nand the former hollows. This is precisely what we find in nature. The\r\ngreat majority of isolated hills and hilly tracts owe their existence as\r\nsuch merely to the fact that they are formed of more durable materials\r\nthan the rock-masses by which they are surrounded. When a line of\r\ndislocation is visible at the surface, it is simply because rocks of\r\nunequal durability have been brought into juxtaposition. The more easily\r\ndenuded strata have wasted away to a greater extent than the tougher\r\nmasses on the other side of the dislocation. Nearly all elevations,\r\ntherefore, may be looked upon as monuments of the denudation of the\r\nland; they form hills for the simple reason that they have been better\r\nable to withstand the attacks of the denuding agents than the rocks out\r\nof which the hollows have been eroded.\r\n\r\n86. To this general rule there are exceptions, the most obvious being\r\nhills and mountains of volcanic origin, such as Hecla, Etna, Vesuvius,\r\n&c., and, on a larger scale, the rocky ridge of the Andes. Again, it is\r\nevident that the great mountain-chains of the world are due in the first\r\nplace to upheaval; but these mountains, as we now see them--peaks,\r\ncliffs, precipices, gorges, ravines--have been carved out of the solid\r\nblock, as it were, by the ceaseless action of the subaerial forces. The\r\ndirection of river-valleys has in like manner been determined in the\r\nfirst place by the original slope of the land; but the deep dells, the\r\nbroad valleys and straths, have all been scooped out by running water.\r\nThe northern Highlands of Scotland, for example, evidently formed at one\r\ntime a broad table-land, elevated above the level of the sea by the\r\nsubterranean forces. Out of this old table-land the denuding agents,\r\nacting through untold ages, have carved out all the numerous ravines,\r\nglens, and valleys, the intervening ridges left behind now forming the\r\nmountains. It is true that now and again streams are found flowing in\r\nthe direction of a fault, but that is simply because the dislocation is\r\na line of weakness, along which it is easier for the denuding forces to\r\nact. For one fault that we find running parallel to the course of a\r\nriver, we may observe hundreds cutting across its course at all angles.\r\nThe great rocky basins occupied by lakes, which are so abundant in the\r\nmountainous districts of temperate regions and in northern latitudes,\r\nare believed to have been excavated by the erosive power of glacier-ice;\r\nand they point, therefore, to a time when our hemisphere must have been\r\nsubjected to a climate severe enough to nourish massive glaciers in the\r\nBritish Islands and similar latitudes. It may be concluded that the\r\npresent physiography of the land is proximately due solely to the action\r\nof the denuding agents--rain, frost, rivers, and the sea. But the lines\r\nalong which these agents act with greatest intensity have been\r\ndetermined in the first place by the subterranean forces which upheaved\r\nthe solid crust into great table-lands or mountain undulations. Both the\r\nremote and the proximate causes of the earth's surface-features,\r\nhowever, have acted in concert and contemporaneously, for no sooner\r\nwould new land emerge above the sea-level than the breakers would assail\r\nit, and all the forces of the atmosphere would be brought to bear upon\r\nit--rain, frost, and rivers--so that the beginning of the sculpturing of\r\nhill and valley dates back to the period when the present lands were\r\nslowly emerging from the ocean. So great is the denudation of the land,\r\nthat in process of time the whole would be planed down to the level of\r\nthe sea, if it were not for the subterranean forces, which from time to\r\ntime depress and elevate different portions of the earth's crust. It\r\ncan be proved that strata miles in thickness have been removed bodily\r\nfrom the surface of our own country by the seemingly feeble agents of\r\ndenudation. All the denuded material--mud, sand, and gravel--carried\r\ndown into the sea has been re-arranged into new beds, and these have\r\never and anon been pushed up to the light of day, and scarped and\r\nchannelled by the denuding forces, the resulting detritus being swept\r\ndown as before into the sea, to form fresh deposits, and so on. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that the present arrangement of land and sea has not\r\nalways existed. There was a time before the present distribution of land\r\nobtained, and a time will yet arrive when, after infinite modifications\r\nof surface and level, the continents and islands may be entirely\r\nre-arranged, the sea replacing the land, and _vice versa_. To trace the\r\nhistory of such changes in the past is one of the great aims of the\r\nscientific geologist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAEONTOLOGY.[F]\r\n\r\n   [F] _Palaios_, ancient, _onta_, beings, and _logos_, a discourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n87. _Fossils._--In our description of rock-masses, and again in our\r\naccount of geological agencies, we referred to the fact that certain\r\nrocks are composed in large measure, or exclusively, of animal or\r\nvegetable organisms, or of both together; and we saw that analogous\r\norganic formations were being accumulated at the present time. But we\r\nhave deferred to this place any special account of the organic remains\r\nwhich are entombed in rocks. _Fossils_, as these are called, consist\r\ngenerally of the harder and more durable parts of animals and plants,\r\nsuch as bones, shells, teeth, seeds, bark, and ligneous tissues, &c. But\r\nit is usual to extend the term fossil to even the _casts_ or\r\n_impressions_ of such remains, and to foot-marks and tracks, whether of\r\nvertebrates, molluscs, crustaceans, or annelids. The organic remains\r\nmet with in the rocks have usually undergone some chemical change. They\r\nhave become _petrified_ wholly or in part. The gelatine which originally\r\ngave flexibility to some of them has disappeared, and even the carbonate\r\nand phosphate of lime of the harder parts have frequently been replaced\r\nby other mineral matter, by flint, pyrites, or the like. So perfect is\r\nthe petrifaction in many cases, that the most minute structures have\r\nbeen entirely preserved--the original matter having been replaced atom\r\nby atom. As a rule, fossils occur most abundantly and in the best state\r\nin clay-rocks, like shale; while in porous rocks, like sandstone, they\r\nare generally poorly preserved, and not of so frequent occurrence. One\r\nreason for this is, that clay-rocks are much less pervious than\r\nsandstone, and their imbedded fossils have consequently escaped in\r\ngreater measure the solvent powers of percolating water. But there are\r\nother reasons for the comparative paucity of fossils in arenaceous\r\nstrata, as we shall see presently.\r\n\r\n88. _Proofs of varied Physical Conditions._--Organic remains are either\r\nof terrestrial, fresh-water, or marine origin, and they are therefore of\r\nthe utmost value to the geologist in deciphering the history of those\r\ngreat changes which have culminated in the present. But we can go a step\r\nfurther than this. We know that at the present day the distribution of\r\nanimal and vegetable life is due to a variety of causes--to climatic and\r\nphysical conditions. The creatures inhabiting arctic and temperate\r\nregions contrast strongly with those that tenant the tropics. So also we\r\nobserve a change in animal and vegetable forms as we ascend from the low\r\ngrounds of a country to its mountain heights. Similar changes take place\r\nin the sea. The animals and plants of littoral regions differ from those\r\nwhose habitat is in deeper water. Now, the fossiliferous strata of our\r\nglobe afford similar proofs of varying climatic and physical conditions.\r\nThere are littoral deposits and deep-sea accumulations: the former are\r\ngenerally coarse-grained (conglomerates, grit, and sandstone); the\r\nlatter are for the most part finer-grained (clay, shale, limestone,\r\nchalk, &c.); and both inshore and deep-water formations have each their\r\npeculiar organic remains. Again, we know that some parts of the\r\nsea-bottom are not so prolific in life as others--where, for example,\r\nany considerable deposit of sand is taking place, or where sediment is\r\nbeing constantly washed to and fro upon the bottom, shells and other\r\ncreatures do not appear in such numbers as where there is less\r\ncommotion, and a finer and more equable deposit is taking place. It is\r\npartly for the same reason that certain rocks are more barren of organic\r\nremains than others.\r\n\r\n89. _Fossil Genera and Species frequently extinct._--It might perhaps at\r\nfirst be supposed that similar rocks would contain similar fossils. For\r\nexample, we might expect that formations resembling in their origin\r\nthose which are now forming in our coral seas would also, like the\r\nlatter, contain corals in abundance, with some commingling of shells,\r\ncrustaceans, fish, &c., such as are peculiar to the warm seas in which\r\ncorals flourish. And this in some measure holds good. But when we\r\nexamined carefully the fossils in certain of the limestones of our own\r\ncountry, we should find that while the same great orders and classes\r\nwere actually present, yet the genera and species were frequently\r\nentirely different; and not only so, but that often none of these were\r\nnow living on the earth. Moreover, if we extended our research, we\r\nshould soon discover that similar wide differences actually obtained\r\nbetween many of the limestones themselves and other fossiliferous strata\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n90. _Fossiliferous Strata of Different Ages._--Another fact would also\r\ngradually dawn upon us--this, namely, that in certain rocks the fossils\r\ndepart much more widely from analogous living forms, than the organic\r\nremains in certain other rocks do. The cause of this lies in the fact\r\nthat the fossiliferous strata are of different ages; they have not all\r\nbeen formed at approximately the same time. On the contrary, they have\r\nbeen slowly amassed, as we have seen, during a long succession of eras.\r\nWhile they have been accumulating, great vicissitudes in the\r\ndistribution of land and sea have taken place, climates have frequently\r\naltered, and the whole organic life of the globe has slowly changed\r\nagain and again--successive races of plants and animals flourishing each\r\nfor its allotted period, and then becoming extinct for ever.[G] Thus,\r\nstrata formed at approximately the same time contain generally the same\r\nfossils; while, on the other hand, sedimentary deposits accumulated at\r\ndifferent periods are charged with different fossils. Fossils in this\r\nway become invaluable to the geologist. They enable him to identify\r\nformations in separate districts, and to assign to them their relative\r\nantiquity.[H] If, for example, we have a series of formations, A, B, C,\r\npiled one on the top of the other, A being the lowest, and C the\r\nhighest, and each charged with its own peculiar fossils, we may compare\r\nthe fossils met with in other sets of strata with the organic remains\r\nfound in A, B, C. Should the former be found to correspond with the\r\nfossil contents of B, we conclude that the rocks in which they occur are\r\napproximately of contemporaneous origin with B, even although the\r\nequivalents of the formations A and C should be entirely wanting.\r\nFurther, we soon learn that the order of the series A, B, C, is never\r\ninverted. If A be the lowest, and C the highest stratum in one place, it\r\nis quite certain that the same order of succession will obtain wherever\r\nthe equivalents of these strata happen to occur together. But the\r\nsuccession of strata is not invariably the same all the world over; in\r\nsome countries, we may have dozens of separate formations piled one on\r\nthe top of the other; in other countries, many members of the series are\r\nabsent; in brief, _blanks in the succession_ are of constant occurrence.\r\nBut by dovetailing, as it were, all the formations known to us, we are\r\nenabled to form a more or less complete series of rocks arranged in the\r\norder of their age. A little reflection will serve to shew that the\r\npartial mode in which the strata are distributed over the globe arises\r\nchiefly from two causes. We have to remember, _first_, that the deposits\r\nthemselves were laid down only here and there in irregular spreads and\r\npatches--opposite the mouths of rivers, at various points along the\r\nancient coast-lines, and over certain areas in the deeper abysses of the\r\nocean--the coarser accumulations being of much less extent than those\r\nformed of finer materials. And, _second_, we must not forget the intense\r\ndenudation which they have experienced, so that miles and miles of\r\nstrata which once existed have been swept away, and their materials\r\nbuilt up into new formations.\r\n\r\n   [G] To this there are some exceptions. Certain small foraminifers,\r\n       for example, met with in some of the oldest formations, do not\r\n       seem to differ from species which are still living. The genus\r\n       _Lingula_ (Mollusca) has also come down from remotest ages,\r\n       having outlived all its earlier associates.\r\n\r\n   [H] This holds strictly true, however, only in regard to comparatively\r\n       limited areas. The student must remember that strata occurring\r\n       in widely separate regions of the earth, even although they\r\n       contain very much the same assemblage of fossils, are not\r\n       necessarily contemporaneous, in the strict meaning of the word;\r\n       for the _fauna_ and _flora_ (the animal and plant life) may have\r\n       died out, and become replaced by new forms more rapidly in one\r\n       place than another. The term 'contemporaneous,' therefore, is a\r\n       very lax one, and may sometimes group together deposits which,\r\n       for aught that we can tell, may really have been accumulated at\r\n       widely separated times.\r\n\r\n91. _Gradual Extinction of Species._--When a sufficient number of\r\nfossils has been diligently compared, we discover that those in the\r\nyounger strata approach most nearly to the present living forms, and\r\nthat the older the strata are, the more widely do their organic remains\r\ndepart from existing types of animals and plants. We may notice also,\r\nthat when a series of beds graduate up into each other, so that no\r\nstrongly marked line separates the overlying from the underlying strata,\r\nthere is also a similar gradation amongst the fossils. The fossils in\r\nthe highest beds may differ entirely from those in the lowest; but in\r\nthe middle beds there is an intermingling of forms. In short, it is\r\nevident that the creatures gradually became extinct, and were just as\r\ngradually replaced by new forms, until a time came when all the species\r\nthat were living while the lowest beds were being amassed, at last died\r\nout, and a complete change was effected.\r\n\r\n92. _Proofs of Cosmical Changes of Climate._--From the preceding remarks\r\nit will be also apparent that fossils teach us much regarding the\r\nclimatology of past ages. They tell us how the area of the British\r\nIslands has experienced many vicissitudes of climate, sometimes\r\nrejoicing in a warm or almost tropical temperature, at other times\r\nvisited with a climate as severe as is now experienced in arctic and\r\nantarctic regions. Not only so, but we learn from fossils that\r\nGreenland once supported myrtles and other plants which are now only\r\nfound growing under mild and genial climatic conditions; while, on the\r\nother hand, remains of arctic mammals are met with in the south of\r\nFrance. Such great changes of climate are due, according to Mr Croll, to\r\nvariations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit combined with the\r\nprecession of the equinox. It is well known that the orbit of our earth\r\nbecomes much more elliptical at certain irregularly recurring periods\r\nthan it is at present. During a period of extreme ellipticity, the earth\r\nis, of course, much further away from the sun in _aphelion_[I] than it\r\nis at a time of moderate ellipticity, while, in _perihelion_,[J] it is\r\nconsiderably nearer. Now, let us suppose that, at a time when the\r\nellipticity is great, the movement known as the precession of the\r\nequinox has changed the incidence of our seasons, so that our summer\r\nhappens in perihelion and not in aphelion, while that of the southern\r\nhemisphere occurs in aphelion, and not, as at present, in perihelion.\r\nUnder such conditions, the climate of the globe would experience a\r\ncomplete change. In the northern hemisphere, so long and intensely cold\r\nwould the winter be, that all the moisture that fell would fall as rain,\r\nand although the summer would be very warm, it would nevertheless be\r\nvery short, and the heat then received would be insufficient to melt the\r\nsnow and ice which had accumulated during the winter. Thus gradually\r\nsnow and ice would cover all the lands down to temperate latitudes. In\r\nthe southern hemisphere, the reverse of all this would obtain. The\r\nwinter there would be short and mild, and the summer, although cool,\r\nwould be very long. But such changes would bring into action a whole\r\nseries of physical agencies, every one of which would tend still further\r\nto increase the difference between the climates of the two hemispheres.\r\nOwing to the vast accumulation of snow and ice in the northern\r\nhemisphere, the difference of temperature between equatorial and\r\ntemperate and polar regions would be greater in that hemisphere than in\r\nthe southern. Hence the winds blowing from the north would be more\r\npowerful than those coming from the southern and warmer hemisphere, and\r\nconsequently the warm water of the tropics would necessarily be impelled\r\ninto the southern ocean. This would tend still further to lower the\r\ntemperature of our hemisphere, while, at the same time, it would raise\r\ncorrespondingly the temperature at our antipodes. The general result\r\nwould be, that in our hemisphere ice and snow would cover the ground\r\ndown to low temperate latitudes--the British Islands being completely\r\nsmothered under a great sea of confluent glaciers. In the southern\r\nhemisphere, on the contrary, a kind of perennial summer would reign even\r\nup to the pole. Such conditions would last for some ten or twelve\r\nthousand years, and then, owing to the precession of the equinox, a\r\ncomplete change would come about--the ice-cap would disappear from the\r\nnorth, and be replaced by continuous summer, while at the same time an\r\nexcessively severe or glacial climate would characterise the south; and\r\nsuch great changes would occur several times during each prolonged epoch\r\nof great eccentricity. This, in few words, is an outline of Mr Croll's\r\ntheory. That theory is at present _sub judice_, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that it gives a reasonable explanation of many geological facts\r\nwhich have hitherto been inexplicable. Of course, it is not maintained\r\nthat all changes of climate are due directly or indirectly to\r\nastronomical causes. Local changes of climate--changes affecting limited\r\nregions--may be induced by mutations of land and sea, resulting in the\r\npartial deflection of ocean currents, which are the chief secondary\r\nmeans employed by nature for the distribution of heat over the globe's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n   [I] _Apo_, away from; _helios_, the sun.\r\n\r\n   [J] _Peri_, round about or near by; _helios_, the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in the foregoing paragraphs, it is clear that\r\nin our endeavours to decipher the geological history of our planet,\r\npalaeontological must go hand in hand with stratigraphical evidence. We\r\nmay indeed learn much from the mode of arrangement of the rocks\r\nthemselves. But the test of superposition does not always avail us. It\r\nis often hard, and sometimes quite impossible, to tell from\r\nstratigraphical evidence which are the older rocks of a district. In the\r\nabsence of fossils we must frequently be in doubt. But physical evidence\r\nalone will often afford us much and varied information. It will shew us\r\nwhat was land and what sea at some former period; it will indicate to us\r\nthe sites of ancient igneous action; it will tell us of rivers, and\r\nlakes, and seas which have long since passed away. Nay, in some cases,\r\nit will even convince us that certain great climatic changes have taken\r\nplace, by pointing out to us the markings, and debris, and wandered\r\nblocks which are the sure traces of ice action, whether of glaciers or\r\nicebergs. The results obtained by combining physical and palaeontological\r\nevidence form what is termed Historical Geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n93. The fossiliferous strata, as they are generally termed, have been\r\nchronologically arranged in a series of _formations_, each of which is\r\ncharacterised by its own peculiar suites of fossils. Their relative age\r\nhas been determined, as we have indicated above, by their fossils, and\r\nalso by certain physical tests, the chief of these being\r\n_superposition_. It holds invariably true that a formation, A, found\r\nresting upon another series of strata, B, will always occur in precisely\r\nthe same position, wherever these two deposits occur together. If B\r\nshould appear in some place as resting upon A, we may be sure that the\r\nbeds have been inverted during the contortion of the strata consequent\r\nupon subterranean action (see fig. 11, page 34). Again, another useful\r\ntest of the relative age of strata lies in the circumstance that one is\r\noften made up or contains fragments of the other. In this case, then, it\r\nis quite clear which is the more recent accumulation. These tests have\r\nnow been applied to the strata in many parts of the world, and the\r\nresult is that geologists have been able to arrive at a chronological\r\narrangement or classification, and so to construct a table shewing the\r\nrelative position which would be occupied by all the different\r\nformations, if these occurred together in one place. In the British\r\nIslands the long series of strata is well developed, but many of the\r\nformations are much more meagrely represented than their equivalents in\r\nother countries. But even when we attempt to fill up the blanks in our\r\nown series by dovetailing with them the strata of foreign countries,\r\nthere yet remain numerous breaks in the succession, pointing to the fact\r\nthat the stony record is a very fragmentary one at the best. No doubt\r\nthere are many large tracts of the earth's surface which have not yet\r\nbeen investigated, and when these are known we may hope to have our\r\nknowledge greatly increased. But no one who reflects upon the mode of\r\norigin of the fossiliferous strata, and the wonderful mutations which\r\nthe earth has undergone, can reasonably anticipate that a perfect and\r\ncomplete record of the geological history of our planet shall ever be\r\ncompiled from the broken and fragmentary testimony of the rocks.\r\n\r\n94. The following table gives the names of the different formations\r\narranged in the order of their superposition, the youngest being at the\r\ntop, and the oldest known at the bottom:\r\n\r\n  IV. POST-TERTIARY OR QUATERNARY--\r\n        Historical or Recent.\r\n        Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n  III. TERTIARY OR CAINOZOIC--\r\n        Pliocene.\r\n        Miocene.\r\n        Eocene.\r\n\r\n  II. SECONDARY OR MESOZOIC--\r\n        Cretaceous.\r\n        Jurassic.\r\n        Triassic.\r\n\r\n  I. PRIMARY OR PALAEOZOIC--\r\n        Permian.\r\n        Carboniferous.\r\n        Devonian and Old Red Sandstone.\r\n        Silurian.\r\n        Cambrian.\r\n        Laurentian or Pre-Cambrian.\r\n\r\n95. The PRIMARY formations are so called because they are the oldest\r\nknown to us: they are not necessarily the first-formed aqueous deposits.\r\nDr Hutton said truly: There is no trace of a beginning, and no signs of\r\nan end. In the PRIMARY or PALAEOZOIC (ancient-life) formations are found\r\nthe earliest traces of life. The forms as a rule depart very widely from\r\nthose with which we are acquainted now. The _Laurentian_ rocks have\r\nyielded only one fossil--a large foraminifer named _Eozoon Canadense_.\r\nThe _Cambrian_ formation contains but few fossils--crustaceans,\r\nmolluscs, zoophytes, and worm-tracks. The _Silurian_ strata are often\r\nabundantly fossiliferous. All the great classes of invertebrates are\r\nrepresented, and fish remains also occur. The _Devonian_ and _Old Red\r\nSandstone_ are also characterised by the presence of an abundant fauna.\r\nIn the Old Red Sandstone are numerous fish remains; it appears to have\r\nbeen an estuarine or lacustrine deposit; the Devonian, on the other\r\nhand, was marine, like the Silurian and Cambrian. The _Carboniferous_\r\nformation is the chief repository of coal in Britain. It consists of\r\nterrestrial, fresh or brackish water, and marine deposits. The fauna and\r\nflora of the _Permian_, which is partly a marine and partly a\r\nfresh-water formation, are allied, upon the whole, to those of the\r\nCarboniferous, but offer at the same time many contrasts.\r\n\r\n96. The SECONDARY OR MESOZOIC (middle-life) formations contain\r\nassemblages of fossils which do not depart so widely from analogous\r\nliving forms as those belonging to Palaeozoic times. The _Triassic_\r\nstrata yield abundance of rock-salt. In Britain they contain very few\r\nfossils, but these are more abundant in the Triassic deposits of foreign\r\ncountries. The oldest known mammals first appear in this formation. The\r\n_Jurassic_ formation is very highly fossiliferous. It is distinguished\r\nby the occurrence of numerous reptilian remains. Nearly all the beds of\r\nthis formation are marine, but there are associated with these the\r\nremains of a forest or old land surface, and a considerable accumulation\r\nof estuarine or fresh-water deposits; impure coals also occur in this\r\nformation. The _Cretaceous_ strata are almost wholly marine, and chiefly\r\nof deep-water origin. But some land-plants are found, chiefly ferns,\r\nconifers, and cycads. Near the base of the formation occurs a great\r\nriver deposit (Weald clay) with numerous remains of reptiles.\r\n\r\n97. Among the oldest strata of the TERTIARY or CAINOZOIC (recent-life)\r\ndivision we meet with the _dawn_ of the existing state of the testaceous\r\nfauna--the _Eocene_ (_eos_, dawn, and _kainos_, recent) containing three\r\nand a half per cent. of recent species among its shells. The proportion\r\nof recent species increases in the _Miocene_ (_meion_, less, and\r\n_kainos_, recent), although the majority of the molluscs entombed in\r\nthat formation belong to extinct species. In the _Pliocene_ (_pleion_,\r\nmore, and _kainos_, recent), however, the extinct species are in a\r\nminority.\r\n\r\nThe POST-TERTIARY or QUATERNARY division comprises the concluding\r\nchapters of geological history. The _Pleistocene_ (_pleistos_, most, and\r\n_kainos_, recent) contains no extinct species of shells, but a number of\r\nextinct mammalia. In the _Recent_ deposits all the species of animals\r\nand plants are living. The Tertiary and Quaternary formations are partly\r\nof marine and partly of terrestrial and fresh-water origin. At the close\r\nof the Tertiary period the 'glacial epoch' of Pleistocene times began,\r\nand the British Islands and a large part of northern Europe and North\r\nAmerica were then cased in snow and ice. Traces of glacial conditions\r\nhave also been met with in the Eocene and Miocene. The evidence\r\nfurnished by Palaeozoic and Mesozoic formations points chiefly to mild,\r\ngenial, and sometimes tropical conditions. But traces of ice action are\r\noccasionally noted (namely, in the Silurian, Old Red Sandstone,\r\nCarboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous formations), pointing, perhaps,\r\nin some of the cases, to former alternations of cold and warm periods.\r\nIndeed, the belief is now gaining ground, that the so-called glacial\r\nepoch of Pleistocene times was not one long continuous age of ice, but\r\nrather consisted of an alternation of warm and cold periods. And it is\r\nnot improbable, but highly likely, that similar alternations of climate\r\nhave happened during every period of great eccentricity of the earth's\r\norbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1.
