Robinson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\n  Devils Tower is a steep-sided mass of igneous rock that rises above\r\n  the surrounding hills and the valley of the Belle Fourche River in\r\n  Crook County, Wyo. It is composed of a crystalline rock, classified as\r\n  phonolite porphyry, that when fresh is gray but which weathers to\r\n  green or brown. Vertical joints divide the rock mass into polygonal\r\n  columns that extend from just above the base to the top of the Tower.\r\n\r\n  The hills in the vicinity and at the base of the Tower are composed of\r\n  red, yellow, green, or gray sedimentary rocks that consist of\r\n  sandstone, shale, or gypsum. These rocks, in aggregate about 400 feet\r\n  thick, include, from oldest to youngest, the upper part of the\r\n  Spearfish formation, of Triassic age, the Gypsum Spring formation, of\r\n  Middle Jurassic age, and the Sundance formation, of Late Jurassic age.\r\n  The Sundance formation consists of the Stockade Beaver shale member,\r\n  the Hulett sandstone member, the Lak member, and the Redwater shale\r\n  member.\r\n\r\n  The formations have been only slightly deformed by faulting and\r\n  folding. Within 2,000 to 3,000 feet of the Tower, the strata for the\r\n  most part dip at 3°-5° towards the Tower. Beyond this distance, they\r\n  dip at 2°-5° from the Tower.\r\n\r\n  The Tower is believed to have been formed by the intrusion of magma\r\n  into the sedimentary rocks, and the shape of the igneous mass formed\r\n  by the cooled magma is believed to have been essentially the same as\r\n  the Tower today. Devils Tower owes its impressiveness to its\r\n  resistance to erosion as compared with the surrounding sedimentary\r\n  rocks, and to the contrast of the somber color of the igneous column\r\n  to the brightly colored bands of sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nDevils Tower, a mass of bare rock that rises abruptly from the\r\nsurrounding grasslands and pine forests, is one of the most conspicuous\r\ngeologic features of the Black Hills region. Because of its scenic\r\nbeauty and scientific interest, President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906\r\nestablished Devils Tower and a small surrounding area as the first\r\nNational Monument.\r\n\r\nThe Devils Tower National Monument covers an area of about 2 square\r\nmiles near the center of Crook County in northeastern Wyoming (fig. 52).\r\nA paved road from the entrance of the National Monument goes south 7\r\nmiles to join U. S. Highway 14 at a point 29 miles northwest of\r\nSundance, Wyo., and 33 miles northeast of Moorcroft, Wyo. The entrance\r\nto the National Monument may also be reached by a road (paved in\r\nWyoming) that goes northeastward from the entrance, via Hulett and\r\nAladdin, Wyo., to Belle Fourche, S. Dak., a distance of about 54 miles,\r\nwhere it joins U. S. Highways 212 and 85.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 52.—Index map showing location of Devils Tower\r\n    National Monument.]\r\n\r\nPublic campgrounds and a natural history museum are maintained by the\r\nNational Park Service at the base of the Tower about 3 miles by paved\r\nroad from the Monument entrance.\r\n\r\nThe geology of the Devils Tower National Monument was mapped during the\r\nsummer of 1954 by the U. S. Geological Survey in collaboration with the\r\nNational Park Service. The work was part of a study of the geology of\r\nthe northern and western parts of the Black Hills region conducted by\r\nthe Survey on behalf of the Division of Raw Materials of the U. S.\r\nAtomic Energy Commission. The author wishes to acknowledge the\r\nassistance of the National Park Service and, in particular, Mr. Raymond\r\nMcIntyre, Superintendent of Devils Tower National Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocks exposed in the Devils Tower National Monument may be divided\r\non the basis of their origin into two general types; igneous and\r\nsedimentary. The Tower itself is composed of igneous rock; that is, rock\r\nformed directly by cooling and crystallization of once molten materials.\r\nThe rocks exposed in the remainder of the Monument are sedimentary; that\r\nis, they were formed by the consolidation of fragmental materials\r\nderived from other rocks or accumulations of chemical precipitates that\r\nwere deposited either on the floors of prehistoric seas or near the\r\nshores of such seas. These rocks, which crop out around the igneous\r\nmass, are layers of shale, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, gypsum, and\r\nlimestone. Devils Tower owes its impressiveness to the differing rates\r\nof erosion of these rock types—the soft sedimentary rocks erode more\r\neasily than the hard igneous rock—and to the contrast of the somber\r\ncolor of the igneous column to the brightly colored bands of sedimentary\r\nrock that surround its base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DEVILS TOWER\r\n\r\nDevils Tower rises steeply for about 600 feet from a broad talus slope\r\nat its base. The top of the Tower, at an altitude of 5,117 feet, is\r\nabout 1,270 feet above the Belle Fourche River. The Tower is about 800\r\nfeet in diameter at the base. The sides rise almost vertically from the\r\nbase for a distance of from 40 to 100 feet and then slope in more gently\r\nto form a narrow bench. Above this bench, the sides again rise steeply,\r\nat angles of 75° to over 85°, to within about 100 feet of the top where\r\nthe angle becomes less steep and the top edge of the Tower is somewhat\r\nrounded. The top of the Tower is almost flat and measures about 180 feet\r\nfrom east to west and about 300 feet from north to south.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of the Tower is its polygonal columns\r\n(fig. 53). Most of the columns are 5 sided, but some are 4 and 6 sided.\r\nThe larger columns measure 6 to 8 feet in diameter at their base and\r\ntaper gradually upward to about 4 feet at the top. The columns are\r\nbounded by well-developed smooth joints in the middle part of the Tower,\r\nbut as the columns taper upward, the joints between them, rather than\r\nbeing smooth, may be wavy and some of the columns may unite. Numerous\r\ncross-fractures in the upper part of the Tower divide the column into\r\nmany small irregularly shaped blocks (fig. 53_A_).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 53.—A. Northwest side of Devils Tower showing\r\n    how the columns taper or converge and in places unite near the top\r\n    and are cut by numerous cross-fractures.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 53.—B. Southwest corner of Devils Tower\r\n    showing the columns flaring out and merging to form the massive\r\n    base.]\r\n\r\nThe columns in the central and upper parts of the Tower are almost\r\nvertical but flare out at the bench about 100 feet above the base (fig.\r\n53_B_). On the southwest side the columns are nearly horizontal. Where\r\nthe columns flare out, several columns may join to form a larger, less\r\ndistinct column that merges with the massive base.\r\n\r\nAt the base of the tower, below the bench, the rock is massive and\r\njointing, poorly developed. Here the joints form large irregularly\r\nshaped blocks rather than columns.\r\n\r\nColumnar joints form as the result of contraction within a rock mass. In\r\nigneous rock the contraction is the result of cooling; that is, the cold\r\nsolidified rock requires less volume than the same rock when molten. As\r\na rock cools it contracts, and the resulting tension is in a plane\r\nparallel to the cooling surface. When rupture takes place, three\r\nfractures radiate from numerous centers in the plane parallel to the\r\ncooling surface. Ideally, the fractures are at 120° to each other. If\r\nthe centers were evenly distributed, the fractures from different\r\ncenters would join forming hexagonal (6 sided) columns. These fractures\r\nwill go deeper and deeper into the rock as cooling progresses. This\r\ncondition because of many factors, is seldom attained in nature, so the\r\ncolumns may have 4, 5, 6, or even more sides.\r\n\r\nThe rock making up Devils Tower is classified as phonolite porphyry\r\n(Darton and O’Harra, 1907, p. 6) and is of Tertiary age. The fresh\r\nspecimens have a light- to dark-gray or greenish-gray very fine-grained\r\ngroundmass with conspicuous crystals of white feldspar—commonly about\r\none-fourth to one-half inch in diameter—and smaller very dark-green\r\ncrystals of pyroxene. On the weathered surfaces the phonolite porphyry\r\nis a light gray or brownish gray. Lichens growing on the rock may give\r\nit a green, yellowish-green, or brown color.\r\n\r\nUsing a microscope, Albert Johannsen (Darton and O’Harra, 1907, p. 6)\r\nidentified the feldspar crystals as a soda-rich orthoclase and the\r\npyroxene crystals as augite with an outer zone of aegirite. In addition,\r\nphenocrysts of apatite and magnetite, were identified. The groundmass,\r\naccording to Johannsen, consists of orthoclase laths in subparallel\r\narrangement, needles of aegirite, possibly some nephelite, small cubes\r\nof magnetite, and secondary minerals of calcite, kaolin, chlorite,\r\nanalcite, and a anisotropic zeolite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 54.—Generalized section of the sedimentary\r\n    rocks of the Devils Tower National Monument.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  System\r\n    Series\r\n      Formation and member; Thickness, in feet; Columnar section;\r\n          Description\r\n  JURASSIC\r\n    Upper Jurassic\r\n      Sundance formation\r\n        Redwater shale member; 100+; Gray and gray-green shale.

They are divided, from oldest to youngest,\r\ninto the Spearfish formation of Triassic age, the Gypsum Spring\r\nformation of Middle Jurassic age, and the Sundance formation of Late\r\nJurassic age (fig. 54).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPEARFISH FORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Spearfish formation crops out in the southern and northeastern parts\r\nof the Devils Tower National Monument along the valley of the Belle\r\nFourche River and its tributaries and forms conspicuous brownish-red to\r\nmaroon cliffs that border the Belle Fourche valley for several miles in\r\nthe Devils Tower region. The formation is 450 to 600 feet thick in the\r\nnorthern Black Hills area (Darton, 1909, p. 28); however, only the\r\nuppermost 100 feet are exposed within the National Monument.\r\n\r\nThe Spearfish formation consists of red to maroon siltstone and\r\nsandstone interbedded with mudstone or shale. Locally, greenish-blue\r\nshale partings are found in the siltstone and sandstone. The formation\r\nis poorly cemented and weathers very easily forming, for the most part,\r\ngentle slopes, as on the northeast and southwest sides of the monument.\r\nWhere it does form cliffs, as south of the Tower, the cliffs are cut by\r\nmany sharp gullies.\r\n\r\nNo fossils have been found in the Spearfish formation in the Devils\r\nTower region, but elsewhere in Wyoming, stratigraphically equivalent\r\nrocks contain land vertebrates of Triassic age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GYPSUM SPRING FORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Gypsum Spring formation is exposed in a thin but almost continuous\r\nband around the Tower on the southwest to northeast sides. It also crops\r\nout near the top of the small hill at the eastern boundary of the\r\nNational Monument, a few hundred feet north of the Registration\r\nBuilding. This formation is composed mostly of white gypsum, which\r\nstands out conspicuously between the red beds of the underlying\r\nSpearfish formation and beds of gray-green shale at the base of the\r\noverlying Sundance formation.\r\n\r\nThe Gypsum Spring formation ranges in thickness from about 15 to about\r\n35 feet. It is thickest on the hill at the eastern boundary of the\r\nMonument. Here the formation is made up of a lower unit consisting of a\r\nbed of white massive gypsum 20 feet thick overlain by 14 feet of\r\ninterbedded white gypsum and dark-maroon mudstone. The formation is 15\r\nfeet thick along the cliff directly south of Devils Tower. At this\r\nplace, the formation consists of 12 feet of white massive gypsum\r\ninterbedded with 1-6 inch thick beds of dark-maroon mudstone overlain by\r\n3 feet of dark-brownish-red mudstone. The differences in thickness are\r\nprimarily the result of erosion of the Gypsum Spring formation prior to\r\nthe deposition of the Stockade Beaver shale member of the Sundance\r\nformation (Imlay, 1947, p. 243).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUNDANCE FORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Sundance formation consists of an alternating sequence of\r\ngreenish-gray shale, light-gray to yellowish-brown sandstone and\r\nsiltstone, and gray limestone. The formation crops out above the gypsum\r\nand red shale of the Gypsum Spring formation on the bluffs and low\r\nrolling hills that surround the Tower. The formation consists of four\r\nmembers that are, in order of age from oldest to youngest, the Stockade\r\nBeaver shale member, the Hulett sandstone member, the Lak member, and\r\nthe Redwater shale member (fig. 54) (Imlay, 1947, p. 227-273).\r\n\r\n_Stockade Beaver shale member._—In general, this member, because it is\r\ncomposed mostly of shale, is poorly exposed. The best exposures of the\r\nlower part are on the hill at the east boundary of the Monument and\r\nalong the steep slope south of the Tower. The upper part is fairly well\r\nexposed on the south side of the ridge north of the Tower, near the\r\nnorth boundary of the Monument. The member has a thickness of 85 to 100\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe composition differs considerably in detail from one exposure to\r\nanother, but in general it consists of gray-green shale with interbedded\r\nfine-grained calcareous sandstone. At the base of the member, at nearly\r\nall exposures, is a thin sandstone, 1 to 24 inches thick, containing\r\nblack or dark-gray water-worn chert pebbles that have a maximum\r\ndimension of about 2 inches. Above the basal sand, the lower half of the\r\nmember is composed mostly of gray-green shale, which locally contains\r\nsome interbedded fine-grained calcareous sandstone, thin sandy and shaly\r\nlimestone or dolomitic limestone, and rarely thin beds of red mudstone.\r\nThe upper half of the member consists of dark-gray to gray-green shale\r\nwith interbedded fine-grained calcareous sandstone that range from less\r\nthan 1 foot to 6 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe contact of the Stockade Beaver shale member with the overlying\r\nHulett sandstone member is gradational. The sandstone becomes more\r\nabundant in the upper part of the Stockade Beaver shale, and the contact\r\nbetween those two members is placed at that point where the sandstone\r\nmakes up more than 50 percent of the rocks.\r\n\r\n_Hulett sandstone member._—The Hulett sandstone member is resistant to\r\nweathering and forms a conspicuous, almost vertical, cliff that nearly\r\nencircles the Tower. This member ranges in thickness from about 60 to 70\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Hulett sandstone member consists, in general, of massive\r\nfine-grained glauconitic calcareous sandstone. It is typically yellow or\r\nbrownish yellow but locally may be pink or red. In the lower 5 to 10\r\nfeet the sandstone is in beds from less than 1 inch to 2 feet thick\r\nseparated by gray or greenish-gray shale partings of from less than 1\r\ninch to 6 inches thick. Many of the sandstone beds at the base of the\r\nmember are ripple marked.\r\n\r\nThe 50 to 60 feet in the middle of the member consists of massive beds\r\nthat range in thickness from 5 to 20 feet. This portion is well cemented\r\nand forms the conspicuous cliff seen throughout the area. The upper 5 to\r\n10 feet is thin bedded (beds from less than 1 inch to 6 inches in\r\nthickness) locally shaly, and poorly cemented. This grades upward into\r\nthe overlying sandstone and siltstone of the Lak member.\r\n\r\n_Lak member._—The Lak member crops out above the cliff of Hulett\r\nsandstone that almost encircles the Tower, and it underlies a broad\r\nrolling area in the northwestern part of the Monument. The member is\r\nrarely exposed because it is composed of soft sandstone and siltstone\r\nthat usually weather to gentle slopes and become covered with\r\nvegetation. The best exposure is on the steep hill east of the Tower and\r\nnorthwest of the bridge across the Belle Fourche river.\r\n\r\nThis member is 65 feet thick a few hundred feet east of the Tower, but\r\nmapping within the Monument and measured sections within a few miles of\r\nthe Monument indicate that the average thickness is about 45 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Lak member is typically poorly bedded soft, very fine-grained\r\ncalcareous sandstone and siltstone with a few thin gray-green sandy\r\nshale partings. At the base and near the top of the member may be a few\r\nthin (less than 1 inch to 6 inches thick) well-cemented sandstone beds\r\nthat form small ridges. The sandstone and siltstone grade almost\r\nimperceptibly from one to the other. The color ranges from light yellow\r\nbrown and yellow to red. In the Devils Tower area, shades of yellow and\r\nyellowish brown are most common.\r\n\r\nThe contact of the Lak with the overlying Redwater shale member can be\r\nobserved only in the exposure east of the Tower. Here, the upper 3 feet\r\nof the Lak is a yellowish-brown calcareous silty sandstone with a few\r\ndiscontinuous sandy shale partings (less than 1 inch thick), and the\r\nlower 3 feet of the overlying Redwater shale consists of dark-gray-green\r\nshale with interbedded, thin silty sandstone.\r\n\r\n_Redwater shale member._—This member encircles Devils Tower, but at most\r\nplaces it is covered by talus from the Tower. Even where it is not\r\ncovered by talus, it is poorly exposed. It consists mostly of shale that\r\nweathers into gentle slopes, which are usually covered by vegetation.\r\nThe Redwater shale is partly exposed on Fossil Hill, northwest of Devils\r\nTower, and on the hill in the northwest corner of the Monument. The best\r\nexposures are on Fossil Hill.\r\n\r\nThe top of the Redwater shale member is not exposed within the limits of\r\nthe Monument; consequently, the thickness could not be determined. In\r\nsurrounding areas the Redwater shale ranges in thickness from 150 to 190\r\nfeet. It is at least 100 feet thick on the hill in the northwest corner\r\nof the Monument.\r\n\r\nThe Redwater shale consists mostly of light-gray to dark gray-green soft\r\nshale. In the lower 20 or 30 feet are beds of yellow soft sandstone, 3\r\ninches to 2 feet thick. In the upper part, ranging from 50 feet above\r\nthe base to the top, are lenticular beds of fossiliferous limestone 1\r\ninch to 4 feet thick. Two such beds of fossiliferous limestone are\r\nexposed on Fossil Hill.\r\n\r\nThe Sundance formation contains clams, oysters, belemnites (squids), and\r\nother marine fossils that establish its age as Late Jurassic (Imlay,\r\n1947, p. 244-264).\r\n\r\n\r\n                  STREAM TERRACE DEPOSITS AND ALLUVIUM\r\n\r\nStream deposits (alluvium) are found in the valleys of the small streams\r\naround the Tower and, in particular, in the valley of the Belle Fourche\r\nRiver, that cuts across the southeast corner of the Monument. The\r\ndeposits consist of unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and mud.\r\n\r\nAlong the Belle Fourche River, northwest of the river and between it and\r\nthe main road, the river cut a terrace in the Spearfish formation. On\r\nthe terrace were deposited gravel and sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TALUS AND LANDSLIDE MATERIAL\r\n\r\nThe talus and landslides are composed primarily of the material from the\r\nTower and the Hulett sandstone.\r\n\r\nTalus from the Tower forms a broad apron that completely surrounds the\r\nTower. The talus extends from high on the shoulders of the Tower down to\r\nand across the sedimentary rock. Locally, landslides of this talus have\r\nextended through valleys in the sedimentary rock down almost to the\r\nlevel of the surrounding streams. The talus from the Tower is composed\r\nof fragments of the columns that range from a few inches in diameter to\r\nlarge sections of the columns as much as 8 feet in diameter and 25 feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe cliff of Hulett sandstone that surrounds the Tower breaks off into\r\nrectangular blocks that form talus slopes at the base of the cliffs and\r\nlocally large landslides down the hill below the cliffs. These blocks of\r\nHulett sandstone range in size from a few inches to many feet in\r\ndiameter. The talus material from the Tower has at several places\r\noverlapped the cliff of Hulett sandstone and become mixed with the\r\nmaterial from the cliff.\r\n\r\nAbout 1,400 feet north of the Tower are two patches of what is believed\r\nto be talus formed from sedimentary rocks that once surrounded the\r\nTower. The talus consists of fragments of medium-grained brownish-white\r\nsandstone and, what is apparently, a highly silicified gray or white\r\nfine-grained quartzite. The sandstone resembles that found in the Lakota\r\n(Darton and O’Hara, 1907, p. 3) that lies about 200 feet\r\nstratigraphically above the Redwater shale in the area west of the\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone and quartzite occur in angular blocks that range from less\r\nthan 1 inch to several feet in diameter. The spaces between the blocks\r\nare filled with a yellowish or brownish-white sand.\r\n\r\nThe Lakota sandstone at one time surrounded the Tower and it is believed\r\nthat these blocks are residual blocks that have not been removed by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               STRUCTURE\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks in the National Monument, and in the surrounding\r\narea, are gently folded into many small rolls, basins and domes, which\r\nlocally are cut by faults of small displacement. These small folds are\r\nsuperimposed on a large dome that is collapsed in the middle.\r\n\r\nDevils Tower is near the middle of the collapsed dome. From one-half to\r\nabout a mile from the Tower the sedimentary rocks dip gently from 2° to\r\n5° away from the Tower to form a broad dome. Within a radius of about\r\n2,000 to 3,000 feet of the Tower, the dips change, and the rocks dip, in\r\ngeneral, from 3° to 5° towards the Tower to form a shallow structural\r\nbasin. In the basin itself and on the dome are several small folds. As\r\nan example, Spring No. 1 southwest of the Tower is in the center of a\r\ncomparatively sharp syncline or down-fold at the edge of the basin.\r\nFossil Hill northwest of the Tower is another small structural basin.\r\nThe beds along the top and on the north side of Fossil Hill dip from 12°\r\nto 52° S. Those on the south side of the hill, north of the road,\r\napparently dip very gently northward.\r\n\r\nThree faults were observed in the area of the National Monument. Two of\r\nthe faults are in the Hulett sandstone west of the main road and west of\r\nthe Tower, and the third is in the northwestern side of the Tower near\r\nits base (pl. 30). The faults in the Hulett sandstone are probably\r\nvertical, and the displacement along them is believed to be less than 10\r\nfeet. The fault at the base of the Tower is a low-angle fault that\r\ntrends northwesterly. The attitude of this fault at the point where it\r\ndisappears below the talus is: strike, N. 41° W.; dip, 21° NE. The fault\r\nzone is 4 to 12 inches wide and is filled with a yellowish-green clay\r\nand sheared fragments of altered phonolite porphyry. The rock of the\r\nTower below this fault is somewhat altered; the groundmass is a light\r\ngreenish gray, and the normally shiny crystals of feldspar have a dull\r\nearthy luster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEOLOGIC HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geologic history of the Devils Tower area is part of that of the\r\nBlack Hills region. The uplift of the Black Hills and the subsequent\r\nerosion have exposed the rocks, from which the geologic history of the\r\narea may be interpreted.\r\n\r\nMost of the rocks within the area around the Black Hills are composed of\r\nsediments deposited by water. These sedimentary rocks, which overlie\r\nmuch older rocks (Precambrian), were deposited in a series of successive\r\nlayers during time intervals from the Cambrian period to well into the\r\nTertiary period. Deposits in the ancient seas are represented by\r\nlimestone, shale and some sandstone; deposits on low lands adjacent to\r\nseas, as flood plains and deltas, by sandstone, siltstone, and some\r\nmudstone; and deposits along streams by conglomerate, sandstone and\r\nsiltstone. Between the periods of deposition were intervals when the\r\nland was relatively high, and in certain areas all of the sediments of\r\nan earlier period were eroded away.\r\n\r\nThe oldest formation exposed in the National Monument, the Spearfish\r\nformation, was deposited during Triassic time along flat lands bordering\r\nthe sea. Arms of the sea locally invaded the area to leave deposits of\r\ngypsum, which are found near the base of the Spearfish in areas outside\r\nthe National Monument. The Gypsum Spring formation was deposited in the\r\nsea in Middle Jurassic time following a period of uplift and erosion\r\nthat occurred after the deposition of the Spearfish formation. After the\r\nGypsum Spring formation was deposited, the sea retreated, and another\r\nperiod of erosion followed before Late Jurassic time when the sea\r\ninvaded the area again and the Sundance formation was deposited. The\r\ndepth and conditions for deposition in this sea changed from time to\r\ntime, as shown by the alternating beds of shale and sandstone in the\r\nSundance formation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the deposition of the Sundance formation, there were several\r\nperiods when the area was above sea level and when the sea covered the\r\narea. During the periods when it was above sea level, the higher land\r\nwas eroded, and the sediments deposited at a lower level. When the area\r\nwas covered by the sea, marine sediments, principally shales, were\r\ndeposited. Near the end of the Cretaceous period, the sea made its final\r\nwithdrawal, and the sediments from late Cretaceous time to the present\r\nwere deposited in fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hills uplift developed primarily during early Tertiary time,\r\nalthough it may have started in very late Cretaceous time. At this time\r\nthe present general structural features of the Black Hills area were\r\ndeveloped, and, probably, the igneous rocks, such as Devils Tower, were\r\nintruded (Jaggar, 1901, p. 266). Following this, the Black Hills area\r\nwas repeatedly uplifted, and erosion exposed the older sedimentary and\r\nintrusive rocks. Even today streams continue to strip more and more rock\r\nfrom the country, leaving only local deposits, such as alluvium and\r\nterrace deposits, along the valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORIGIN OF DEVILS TOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of Devils Tower has been a matter of speculation for many\r\nyears, and even today after detailed geologic mapping of the area, no\r\nconclusive proof of its mode of origin can be presented.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories of the origin have been proposed. One of the more\r\npopular of these is that it is the neck of an extinct volcano\r\n(Carpenter, 1888; Dutton and Schwartz, 1936). Another theory is that\r\nDevils Tower and Missouri Buttes (a mass of the same type of rock about\r\n4 miles northwest of the Tower) are the remnants of a laccolith (a\r\ntabular intrusive igneous body, thickest in the middle, and with a\r\nrelatively level floor), the vent for which was under Missouri Buttes\r\n(Jaggar, 1901, p. 264). Darton (1901, p. 69) believed that the Tower is\r\nthe remnant of a laccolith, smaller than the one proposed by Jaggar, the\r\nfeeding vent for which was underneath the Tower.\r\n\r\nMuch more detailed geologic work will have to be done in the surrounding\r\narea before the mode of origin of Devils Tower may be proved\r\nconclusively. The evidence gathered during the present investigation,\r\nhowever, suggests that Devils Tower is a body of intrusive igneous rock,\r\nwhich was never much larger in diameter than the present base of the\r\nTower, and which at depth (1,000 feet or more) is connected to a sill or\r\nlaccolith type body. The bases for this theory are—\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The exposed portion of the Tower is the result of recent erosion.\r\n          At the time of its intrusion it was surrounded and probably\r\n          covered by several hundred feet of sedimentary rock.\r\n  2. The mineral composition and texture are more typical of shallow\r\n          intrusive rocks, which are formed at depth, than extrusive\r\n          rocks, which are formed on the surface.\r\n  3. No evidence of extrusive igneous activity has been found in the\r\n          surrounding area.\r\n  4. Missouri Buttes, about 4 miles to the northwest, and the Tower have\r\n          the same composition so it is assumed that they were derived\r\n          from a common magma; possibly the magma of a large intrusive\r\n          body, such as a laccolith or sill.\r\n  5. In a well drilled about 1½ miles southwest of Missouri Buttes, near\r\n          the center of a structural dome, rock similar to the Tower and\r\n          Missouri Buttes was encountered at about 1,400 feet below the\r\n          base of Missouri Buttes. Inasmuch as the thickness of the\r\n          sedimentary rocks in this area is normally much greater than\r\n          this depth, the rock in the drill hole probably represents an\r\n          intrusive body, rather than the Precambrian igneous rocks upon\r\n          which the younger sedimentary rocks were deposited.\r\n  6. The relatively small amount of talus, slope wash, or terrace gravel\r\n          derived from the Tower and Missouri Buttes suggests that they\r\n          have not been extensively eroded, and therefore the original\r\n          igneous bodies were not much larger than at present.\r\n  7. Columnar jointing is common in intrusive bodies formed at\r\n          comparatively shallow depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following new material has been added to this booklet by the\r\nNational Park Service (Devils Tower National Monument, 1985)_\r\n\r\nThe most recent in depth, geologic study of Devils Tower was done by Don\r\nL. Halverson (1980) and presented in a dissertation, to the Graduate\r\nFaculty of the University of North Dakota.\r\n\r\nHe stated that, “The Missouri Buttes and Devils Tower, however, are\r\nnecks of extinct volcanoes which have been exposed by erosion. This\r\ntheory was first proposed by Carpenter (1888) and later expanded by\r\nDutton and Schwartz (1936). The material which fed these volcanoes came\r\nfrom a minimum depth of 18 km. Evidence for this conclusion is listed in\r\nthe following statements:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The alloclastic breccia in the vicinity of Devils Tower and the\r\n          Missouri Buttes is definitely igneous in origin and probably\r\n          represents periods of violent eruption.\r\n  2. A very definite similarity exists between these two features and\r\n          the volcanic necks in the Taylor Mountain area of New Mexico.\r\n  3. The distinctive columns with basal flare are also found in the\r\n          volcanic necks of the Taylor Mountains (Dutton and Schwartz\r\n          1936), but have not been reported in columnar-jointed\r\n          laccoliths.\r\n  4. The Missouri Buttes and Devils Tower were intruded directly through\r\n          horizontal sediments without disrupting them, even in the\r\n          immediate vicinity of the igneous bodies.\r\n  5. Recent research indicates that many of the laccolithic intrusions\r\n          in the Black Hills region may have been less passive than\r\n          previously considered. Sundance Mountain may be a mixed\r\n          volcanic cone consisting of welded ash fall, massive quartz\r\n          latite, and ash flow tuffs. Nearby Sugarloaf Mountain is\r\n          composed of layered tuffs (Fashbough 1979).\r\n  6. Collapse of materials into partly evacuated reservoir chambers\r\n          accounts for the depressions surrounding the Missouri Buttes\r\n          and Devils Tower. The 90 m of depression at the southern end\r\n          of the Buttes is difficult to explain with a laccolithic\r\n          model.\r\n  7. Flow directions deduced from oriented thin-sections and field\r\n          observations indicate mostly vertical flow. It must be noted\r\n          that in both igneous bodies orientation of some grains is\r\n          horizontal; this could, however, simply indicate turbulent\r\n          flow.\r\n  8. The stability field for the analcime-liquid system is 5 kbar\r\n          minimum (Roux and Hamilton 1976), which indicates that the\r\n          original melt of Devils Tower and Missouri Buttes rock had to\r\n          originate at a minimum depth of 18 km.\r\n  9. It is unlikely that magma which had ascended from great depths and\r\n          had just penetrated the resistant Hulett Member of the\r\n          Sundance Formation, as well as the Lakota and Fall River\r\n          Formations, would be stopped abruptly by the less resistant\r\n          shales above. When the magma reached the shale beds, the\r\n          weight of the column of igneous rock could have exceeded the\r\n          strength of the shale, causing the magma to flow horizontally.\r\n          No indication of horizontal spread, however, is observed. The\r\n          continuously cylindrical shape of the intrusions indicates\r\n          that the magma moved steadily upward and probably reached the\r\n          surface.\r\n  10. Carbonatites have been found, and formally reported, in the nearby\r\n          Bear Lodge Mountains, and also as fragments in the alloclastic\r\n          breccias of the Missouri Buttes. Their presence suggest a high\r\n          volatile content for the magma and the possibility of\r\n          explosive volcanism.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 1.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Carpenter, F.
