Your\r\ncandour and honesty have long been known to me, and I hope the\r\nsentiments and the feelings expressed in the succeeding pages, will be\r\nfound to accord with your own character.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that I was appointed by a party of East Lothian farmers\r\nto visit and report on the Canadas and the United States; but nothing\r\ncould be more unfounded. A younger brother having expressed a wish to\r\ntry his fortune as an American farmer, I resolved to explore the country\r\nfor the purpose of enabling me to give an opinion on the step which he\r\ncontemplated. With this single object in view, my Transatlantic\r\nexcursion was originally planned, and afterwards performed, unfettered\r\nand unassisted by any party whatever.\r\n\r\nHaving been led to travel from a sense of fraternal duty, I would have\r\nwillingly remained satisfied with simply accomplishing the object of my\r\njourney, being aware how recently some individuals of the highest\r\nattainments had published works on America, and how ill qualified I am,\r\nin some respects, to convey an accurate impression of a country and\r\npeople so interesting. But the solicitations of friends induced me to\r\ngive my opinions to the public, and the result will, perhaps, prove\r\ntheir partiality to have been greater than their discernment.\r\n\r\nHaving passed much of my time apart from fashion and politics, the\r\nposition which I occupied in the world may not have been favourable to\r\nan impartial view of all which came under my notice. My acquaintance\r\nwith agriculture enabled me, however, to judge of American farming\r\nwithout relying on the opinions of others, and, while listening\r\npatiently to much which was told me, I drew conclusions only from what I\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nIn measuring the advantages of the different parts of the country by the\r\nstandards of nature, and the reward of agricultural industry by produce,\r\nI hope to have departed from custom without having been led into error.\r\nNature is the most general and invariable of agricultural tests.\r\n\r\nWant of information is a complaint which has been brought against\r\ntreatises on emigration, and the charge in all probability arises from\r\ndiversity of human character; one mind being incapable of furnishing all\r\nrequisite information to another, without previously knowing what is\r\nrequired. The first part of this publication is intended to show the\r\nopportunities which I had of seeing the country, and the second part to\r\naid in forming an opinion of the different places of settlement. I have\r\naimed only to impress the understanding of the reader, and should any of\r\nmy representations and conclusions be found to differ from reality, I\r\nshall regret having written a word on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe common currency of the United States and the Canadas consists of\r\ndollars, expressed by the character $, and worth about four shillings\r\nand threepence sterling. The dollar is divided into one hundred cents,\r\nof about the value of a British halfpenny each. In the State of New York\r\nand Upper Canada the dollar is divided into eight shillings, or sixteen\r\nsixpences currency. In Lower Canada the dollar consists of five\r\nshillings currency. The dollar of Illinois is divided as in the State of\r\nNew York, but the shilling is often called a “_bit_” and the sixpence a\r\n“_piccayune_.”\r\n\r\nI was not aware of any circumstance which could possibly influence my\r\njudgment in favour of one portion of America more than another, until I\r\nheard that my brother Charles had fixed on Illinois as his place of\r\nresidence. Like myself, he had seen Upper Canada before visiting\r\nIllinois, and his preference of the latter district may be regarded by\r\nsome individuals as corroborative of the opinions which I have\r\nexpressed, and by others as the cause of my partiality. But since an\r\ninducement to praise Illinois may exist, my statements regarding it\r\nought to be carefully examined.\r\n\r\nBeing a farmer in the strictest sense of the word, and having written\r\nthe volume at intervals snatched from professional duties, I make no\r\npretensions to correctness, much less to elegance of composition. My\r\nonly aim has been to state plainly and freely what appeared to be truth,\r\nand I trust this will be received as an apology for any inaccuracies of\r\nstyle which may be discovered, and for such dogmatical and homespun\r\nexpressions as may be considered inconsistent with good taste.\r\n\r\n                                                       PATRICK SHIRREFF.\r\n\r\n      MUNGOSWELLS,\r\n  _10th January, 1835_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TOUR IN NORTH AMERICA.\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n CHAP.

My friend and I here agreed to take\r\nan outside place alternately, to accommodate a lady and child with an\r\ninside one. In course of the day I learned from the lady that she was\r\nbooked as a passenger from Dumfries to London, and had, to her regret,\r\nbeen detained a whole day at Carlisle. It was evident that this\r\nunprotected female and her innocent charge had been imposed upon, and\r\nher escape from a second day’s detention was entirely owing to the\r\nlittle concession of my friend and self in her favour.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was served at Penrith, and the party complained loudly of the\r\nfare placed before them. The stage passengers were joined by other\r\ntravellers at Lancaster, where eighteen in number dined together,\r\ncarving for themselves, and several partaking of hot punch, in the space\r\nof twenty minutes, which was the whole delay at Lancaster.\r\n\r\nWe reached Manchester a little after nightfall, where we spent the\r\nevening; and one of my friends not having sufficient change to settle\r\nwith the guard and driver of the coach, he soon afterwards paid them in\r\nthe coffeeroom. Next morning two different individuals presented\r\nthemselves, as deputed by guard and driver to receive their allowance.\r\nMy friend good-humouredly rallied the impostors on the hopelessness of\r\ntheir attempt, and they seemed to feel the force of his satire more than\r\nthey perhaps would have done a scolding. I have noticed the treatment of\r\nthe lady and child at Carlisle, as well as the impostors at Manchester,\r\nin consequence of a lecture from a fellow-passenger on Yankee knavery,\r\nand a well-meant advice to guard myself against American duplicity.\r\nWithout meaning to impeach the character of my fellow-countrymen, I may\r\nremark that the natives of Britain need not illustrate moral delinquency\r\nby examples from other countries. Mankind seem to be, nationally as\r\nindividually, sensible of the faults of others, although, at the same\r\ntime, they are blind to their own.\r\n\r\nWe travelled from Manchester to Liverpool by the railway, on the morning\r\nof the 22d, and accomplished a distance of thirty miles in an hour and a\r\nhalf. Several miles were performed in two minutes, according to my\r\nstop-watch. At the request of a friend, I occupied a place on the\r\noutside of a way coach, and was much annoyed by the current of air and\r\ncoke from the engine. My eyes did not recover the effects of the coke\r\nfor forty-eight hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn the east coast of Scotland the season had proved to be one of the\r\nwettest and latest on record. At the time of our departure the vegetable\r\nkingdom had scarcely responded to the vivifying influence of spring—the\r\nbuds of the hawthorn and the larch were expanding only in sheltered\r\nplaces. England did not present a more advanced vegetation. We were\r\nfortunate, however, in obtaining the first good weather of the season\r\nfor our journey; and, notwithstanding the bleakness of nature, the ever\r\nvarying scene afforded many objects fitted for contemplation. We crossed\r\nthe line separating England from Scotland early on Sunday morning, and\r\nfor many miles afterwards the roads were covered with herds of cattle\r\nand flocks of sheep, travelling towards the south. This was a novel\r\nsight to a Scotsman; such practices on Sabbath being prohibited by the\r\nlaws of his country. The desecration of the Lord’s day may, perhaps, to\r\na certain extent, be traced in the customs of every Christian country,\r\nbut in no case whatever ought appearances to be regarded as the measure\r\nof religious feeling, the seat of which is hid from human eye. Without\r\nassigning to my countrymen purity and intensity of religious emotion, I\r\nmay be permitted to say, a Scottish Sabbath is marked throughout by a\r\nstill, quiet, external decorum, seldom met with in other parts of the\r\nworld, which fosters piety, and checks an open display of profanity. I\r\ntrust her inhabitants will ever respect and preserve its solemnity of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe land from Carlisle to Manchester seemed, generally, poor and\r\nindifferently cultivated. The enclosures are small in size, often\r\nsurrounded by irregular fences, formed and maintained at a sacrifice of\r\nsoil and labour. Many of the grass fields were studded with lean young\r\nhorses and cattle, industriously seeking a repast which nature still\r\nsparingly supplied. Betwixt Manchester and Liverpool, much of the grass\r\nlands had been ploughed with a furrow slice, only two and three inches\r\nin depth. Three stout horses yoked in line, the first of which was led\r\nby a boy, were seen dragging a small harrow, kept on a narrow convex\r\nridge, by means of a man with a rope operating like a rudder, and he was\r\napparently the only severely worked animal engaged in the operation. The\r\nagriculturists of Britain being deemed enlightened, and her soil not\r\nproducing a sufficient quantity of food for the population, it was\r\npainful to witness land so mismanaged and labour so misapplied. This\r\nanomaly may, perhaps, be accounted for, by the genius of the inhabitants\r\nof this district having long been successfully applied to manufactures;\r\nand neither soil nor climate being congenial to agriculture; together\r\nwith entails, tythes, and corn laws, checking the devotion of skill and\r\ncapital to cultivation. Chatmoss, through which the railway passes,\r\nseems, however, an exception, and I regretted time did not permit an\r\nexamination of the interesting management it is under, with which I had\r\nbecome acquainted by means of periodicals devoted to rural affairs.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Liverpool, our first proceeding was to search for a\r\nconveyance to New York, which we obtained in the Napoleon packet-ship;\r\nthe commander, Captain Smith, resigning his cabin to my friend and me,\r\nthe other berths in the ship having been previously engaged, with\r\nexception of one which was required for our companion.\r\n\r\nPart of the 22d, 23d, and 24th, was spent in viewing the attractions of\r\nLiverpool, the chief of which, in my estimation, is the cemetery. This\r\nrepository of mouldering humanity has been recently formed, and its\r\nnumerous beauties have not been matured or mellowed by time. Trees,\r\nshrubs, and flowers, were diminutive, and generally in their winter\r\ngarb, which fully displayed the memorials to the gaze of visitants. The\r\ncenotaph to Mr Huskisson stands near the centre, and can seldom fail of\r\nfixing for a time the attention, and exciting the sympathies of his\r\ncountrymen. The world is now enjoying the green fruits of his genius,\r\nwith prospect of increasing and lasting supply, while the laurels of\r\ncontemporary warriors are barren and fading. So long as the principles\r\nof free trade are cherished and acted on, the memory of Huskisson will\r\nendure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_Voyage from Liverpool to New\r\nYork—Sea-sickness—Crew—Passengers—Details—Approach to New\r\nYork—Washington Hotel._\r\n\r\nAt noon, on the 24th April, the Napoleon got under weigh, and was towed\r\ndown the Mersey by a steamer, in consequence of an adverse wind. In\r\nlittle more than an hour from the time of sailing, I became sea-sick,\r\nwhich afflicted me severely for nearly thirty days, and frustrated the\r\nlittle plans of recreation and amusement which I had formed on shore.\r\nAlthough appearing only once or twice at table, the attention of\r\nfriends, and the situation of my berth, enabled me to know much that was\r\npassing on board. I shall not, however, chronicle many events which took\r\nplace during the voyage, which some of my shipmates will readily pardon.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Napoleon consisted of about thirty, embracing\r\nmen of every country and of every clime. There were eighty passengers in\r\nthe steerage, and thirty in the cabin, eight of whom were ladies.\r\nEngland and Scotland furnished each five gentlemen, cabin passengers;\r\nIreland, two; and the United States of America, three, one of whom had\r\nbeen naturalized from Ireland. All the individuals from England and\r\nIreland, one from Scotland, and two from America, smoked. In some cases,\r\nthe use of tobacco was immoderate, one gentleman smoking a hundred and\r\nfifty segars in fourteen days; the saliva in many parts of the vessel\r\nwas copious and disgusting. Some of the passengers seemed to spend much\r\nof their time in sensual gratification, there being little reading or\r\ncard-playing indulged in. Breakfast was served at eight o’clock,\r\nluncheon at twelve, dinner at four, and tea at eight. The first dinner\r\ncourse occupied about an hour, the second fifteen minutes, and dessert\r\nabout the same length of time. The cabin, in some respects, resembled a\r\nBritish inn, the passengers dressing as they chose, and at all times\r\ncalling for what they wished, champagne, seemingly, being the only wine\r\nrestricted, and which was presented at dinner twice a-week. To those not\r\nof fastidious taste, the Napoleon offered a fit opportunity for\r\nindulgence, the table being copiously stored with substantial food and a\r\nvariety of liquids. The noise of calling the steward, and drawing of\r\ncorks, succeeded each other at short intervals throughout the day, and\r\ngenerally formed my morning and evening salutations. The quantity of\r\ngood things which some individuals stowed under their belts, appeared\r\nexcessive. Man is apt to despise what he cannot enjoy, and sensual\r\nindulgence never appeared to me so unworthy of regard. Champagne,\r\nsparkling in the wine-cup, did not afford a thousandth part of the\r\npleasure I had often derived from the dewdrops glancing in the morning\r\nsunbeam, and when presented to my fevered lips by a most friendly hand,\r\nI envied my pretty Ayrshire cow, Salina, the privilege of quaffing the\r\ncool and limpid fount at Mungoswells.\r\n\r\nOn 20th May, 40° 30ʹ north latitude, 53° west longitude, and 950 miles\r\nfrom New York, Mrs ——, a cabin passenger, gave birth to a female child.\r\nIn compliment to the ship, this little nymph of the sea was to be\r\nchristened Josephine! a name memorable for conjugal affection, and the\r\npoor return such a virtue will sometimes receive.\r\n\r\nOur commander, Captain Smith, was an American by birth, and part owner\r\nof the vessel. He was indefatigable as a seaman, spending successive\r\nnights on deck, and seldom concluding a meal without satisfying himself,\r\nby ocular demonstration, that all was right aloft. To the passengers he\r\nwas attentive; and, considering the situation in which they occasionally\r\nplaced him, also forbearing. Individually, I found him courteous and\r\ngentlemanly in a high degree.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued adverse for the first twenty-five days; and sometimes\r\nblew tempestuously. The weather moderated for the last eight days of the\r\nvoyage, and the bar at New York was made on the morning of the 29th May,\r\nwhich a dense fog prevented us crossing without a pilot. The vessel\r\nstood off and on during the day, and towards noon, six gentlemen,\r\naccompanied by the letter-bag, set out in a fishing-boat for New York,\r\nwhere they landed in safety a few hours afterwards. The fog increasing\r\nas the day advanced, deprived the passengers of the hope of reaching\r\nshore until next day, and all their stock of patience was required to\r\nwithstand the disappointment.\r\n\r\nNext morning I was early on deck. The fog of the preceding day had\r\ndisappeared in course of the night, and the sun shone brilliant in a sky\r\nof cloudless blue. A bracing and favourable breeze filled our canvass,\r\nand hastened on their voyage a thousand vessels around us, which had\r\nbeen detained by the previous unfavourable weather. Land was seen on\r\nboth sides of the channel, but too distant to render objects on its\r\nsurface distinctly visible. At a quarter before eight, a pilot stept on\r\nboard, under whose guidance the Napoleon proceeded merrily on her way.\r\n\r\nUnder the combination of advantages we now enjoyed, our detention on the\r\nprevious day seemed a fortunate occurrence, without which we should have\r\nbeen landed at New York, insensible of the beauties of its approach.\r\n\r\nHaving been nurtured in the country, and by profession and taste brought\r\ninto fellowship with the vegetable kingdom, I anticipated much pleasure\r\non my first introduction to America. This feeling led me on deck early\r\nin the morning, and, with telescope in hand, I watched with anxiety our\r\napproach to the shore. My situation was like that of a famishing person\r\nwith food in view, intense desire without gratification, and brought to\r\nfeel enjoyment by gradual participation. At first the country appeared a\r\nmass of uniform vegetation; by and by, the green broke into different\r\nshades, forest could be distinguished from cultivated field, kinds of\r\ntrees and crops became visible, but I strained my eyeballs almost to\r\nblindness without being able to mark the minute characteristics of\r\nindividuals. The general effect imparted delight, which was heightened,\r\nperhaps, by my having left home at the termination of a tedious winter,\r\nand crossed a wide waste of waters; the green mantle of nature never\r\nappeared to me so rich and fascinating.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of the scenery, on approaching New York, is\r\nbeautiful; consisting of hill, wood, water, island, town, villa, and\r\nhamlet, in every combination which can impart pleasure. But blue\r\nmountains, so prominent in the landscapes of Scotland, and so dear to\r\nher children, are altogether wanting, and the eye searches in vain for\r\nan object of sublimity.\r\n\r\nAn inspecting surgeon came on board at the quarantine station, who\r\nexamined the passengers and crew. On coming to anchor in the river, near\r\nthe wharf, a customhouse officer sealed up the luggage in the berths,\r\nand the cabin passengers were landed by means of a steam-boat.\r\n\r\nOn reaching shore, we learned there was a scarcity of lodgings at this\r\nseason of the year, when the inhabitants of the Southern States travel\r\nnorthwards in quest of health. Our charioteer, after two unsuccessful\r\nattempts to find accommodation, landed us at the Washington Hotel, kept\r\nby Mr Ward, who kindly supplied us with every thing we could desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  _Theatre—Trollopes—Mrs Trollope’s Work—Customhouse\r\n    Officer—Race-course— Westhouses Breeding Stud—Thunderstorm—Return to\r\n    the Hotel—Excursion to Long Island—New town—Flushing—Agriculture in\r\n    the neighbourhood of New York._\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Fanny Kemble taking her benefit on the night of our arrival, it was\r\ndetermined that we should visit the Park theatre. We found the house\r\nwell attended, the ladies greatly outnumbering the gentlemen in the\r\nboxes, while the pit contained males only, apparently belonging to what\r\nis known in England by the operative classes, amongst whom people of\r\ncolour were seen. Having peeped into Mrs Trollope’s work on the Domestic\r\nManners of the Americans, and its illustrations of those witnessed at\r\nthe Cincinnati theatre recurring to memory, I watched the behaviour of\r\nthe audience.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second act, I observed a gentleman in the second tier\r\nof boxes in an indelicate posture in front of the box. Three were\r\nsimilarly situated, at the end of the third act, when several voices in\r\nthe pit called out, “A Trollope, a Trollope,” and a general hissing and\r\nhooting from the same quarter had the effect of inducing the offenders\r\nspeedily to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThis incident at the theatre, amusing in itself, afforded me pleasure,\r\nby exhibiting the operatives in the pit enforcing chaste manners on\r\nthose considering themselves higher in the scale of humanity; and\r\nproving that Mrs Trollope’s remarks had not been altogether lost on the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThe clever, and to some people, amusing work of Mrs Trollope, will have\r\ndifferent effects from what its admirers in Britain contemplate. The\r\nmany sketches of low and incidental character which the book contains,\r\nand given as belonging to the people generally, wounded the feelings of\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States; and by drawing attention to bad\r\npractices, led to the improvement of the people reviled. From much I saw\r\nand heard, the keen satire of this authoress is likely to produce, in a\r\nfew years, the usual improvement of a century. On the other hand, her\r\ncaricatures of manners and institutions fostered the prejudices of many\r\nof the inhabitants of Britain, and engendered dislike to political\r\nchanges taking place in that country, more likely to be accelerated than\r\nretarded by intemperate opposition. When indelicacy flows from the pen\r\nof a female, though veiled by effusions of poetic fancy and garnished by\r\nwit, it is highly dangerous to youthful innocence, and the popularity of\r\nMrs Trollope’s work may be regarded as evidence of want of discernment,\r\nif not of vitiated religious and moral feeling, in a portion of the\r\nreading population of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe piece of the evening was “The Wonder,” in which Miss Kemble did not\r\nappear to advantage. Having formerly seen her at Edinburgh in the play\r\nof the “Hunchback,” the contrast on the present occasion was painful.\r\nWhether my disappointment arose from the difference of character she\r\nrepresented, or a change of feeling on my part, cannot be determined,\r\nbut I left the house long before the conclusion of the piece, for want\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\nNext morning we applied at the customhouse for our luggage, and, on\r\npaying a trifle, obtained a permit for its inspection. The officer on\r\nboard performed his duty in the most gentlemanlike manner; and in less\r\nthan five minutes from the time of going on board, our luggage, under\r\ncharge of a porter, was on the way to the Washington hotel.\r\n\r\nThe New York races take place on the Union Course, Long Island, twelve\r\nmiles distant from the city, and this being the last day of them, we\r\nwere anxious to embrace what we conceived so good an opportunity of\r\nseeing the different ranks of society. Accordingly, we crossed the river\r\nat Brooklyn ferry, and engaged a light four-wheeled waggon drawn by one\r\nhorse. The individuals proceeding to the course in vehicles, and none\r\nwere observed on foot, seemed under a racing mania, and rattled along\r\nthe road expeditiously, many of the horses trotting in admirable style.\r\nOn approaching the course, our horse and waggon were put into a court,\r\nand we proceeded on foot.\r\n\r\nThe Union Course is private property, and completely shut against the\r\npublic by a fence of strong upright posts, or stakes, enclosing a\r\nconsiderable space of more ground than is occupied by the course. For a\r\nconsiderable distance on each side of the winning post, the exterior\r\nfence consists of strong boards impervious to vision, on the top of\r\nwhich are stands capable of containing many thousand people. The\r\ninterior margin of the raceway is fenced by a low open paling, except\r\nopposite the winning-post, where high upright stakes are substituted. A\r\nportion of ground including part of the raceway is thus enclosed for the\r\naccommodation of the horses, and those more immediately interested in\r\nthem, by the stands on one, and close upright stakes on three sides,\r\nwith large gates crossing the raceway, which are kept open during the\r\ntime of running. A quarter dollar was exacted on passing the outer\r\nbarrier of the course, on entering which, we found the first race\r\nconcluded. Inheriting a smack of the jockey, my first object was to\r\nobtain a view of the horses; and on applying for admission into the\r\nenclosure where they were walking, I learned a ticket was the only\r\npassport; but preparations for starting commenced, and the first\r\ntwo-mile heat was run, according to my watch, in three minutes and\r\nfifty-seven seconds. My anxiety for a sight of the horses increasing, I\r\napplied to a gentleman, seemingly of importance in the racing circle, to\r\nbe allowed to approach them, and was informed that on paying three\r\ndollars, 12s. 9d. sterling, I would obtain a ticket of admission into\r\nthe enclosure. The terms on which I could come near the horses appearing\r\nextravagant, I contented myself with peeping through the stakes at a\r\ndistance. It would be unfair to attempt a minute description of the\r\nanimals, under the circumstances in which I was placed, but they seemed\r\nnot quite so strong as English race-horses, though more sprightly and\r\ngraceful in the mode of carrying their heads and tails.\r\n\r\nThere are few finer sights in England than a well-attended race-course\r\nin good weather. All ranks, from the king to the beggar, male and\r\nfemale, assemble in their best equipages and gayest attire. Splendour\r\nand beauty seem to regard the occasion granted for display; and the more\r\nimmediate actors in the scene harmonize with the general pageant, a\r\nwell-trained horse and his rider being a perfect model of chaste\r\nneatness. All is, however, different at New York. In the interior of the\r\nrace-course, there were a limited number of people, few equipages, and a\r\ntotal want of finery or display of any kind. The stands were crowded,\r\nbut amongst the assembled multitude I could not have numbered more than\r\nthirty females who, from their appearance, had no pretensions to the\r\nepithet of lady. The jockeys were of all hues, generally coloured boys,\r\nwhose black faces appeared very grotesque under their bright-coloured,\r\nill-fitting dresses. One jockey, of small size and tender years, was\r\nclothed in shabby leather trowsers, which had formed knee-breeches to\r\ntheir original possessor; and a second had his spindle-shanks in old\r\nboots of the largest dimensions, with strings below his knees to prevent\r\nhis trowsers and boots parting company. Bridles and saddles were covered\r\nwith mould and rust, and in one instance a pair of stirrup-irons were\r\nwarped with rope, to fit them for a little tawny foot. On coming up to\r\nstart for the second heat, the horses displayed much impatience, being,\r\ngenerally, led by one, and sometimes two men on foot, as motley and\r\ngrotesque in appearance as the riders. Two false starts were made; and\r\nat the time of finally getting away, one horse had his tail in the\r\ndirection of the others’ heads. The jockeys rode all in the same style,\r\ntheir toes being placed near to the nose of the horse, and their heads\r\ninclining back above the tail. The second heat was run in three minutes\r\nand fifty-five seconds, after which I withdrew, disappointed at what I\r\nhad witnessed.\r\n\r\nOn reaching a foreign land for the first time, a person is apt to judge\r\nevery thing he sees by the standard of his own country, until the\r\nhome-rust, which more or less accumulates on every one, is rubbed off,\r\nand a consequent expansion of mind takes place. At first it appeared to\r\nme illiberal to exclude the poor from seeing a race, and sordid to exact\r\nmoney from the rich who witnessed it, particularly in a reputed free\r\ncountry like the United States of America. On reflection, however, I\r\ncould not see any impropriety in making those who enjoy the amusement of\r\nhorse racing pay for it, more especially when the government does not\r\nsquander public treasure on such an object, and where the course is\r\nprivate property. I could not ascertain if the course is lucrative, but\r\nthe funds arising from the following sources, which are extracted from a\r\nrace bill, must be considerable.\r\n\r\n Members and their (immediate) families, to pass free.\r\n For every two-horse four-wheel carriage, with not more than four\r\n   passengers,                                                     $1.00\r\n For every four-horse carriage,                                     2.00\r\n For every passenger over four, each                                 .25\r\n For every gig or other two-wheeled carriage, with one passenger,    .50\r\n For every passenger over one, each                                  .25\r\n For every person on horseback,                                      .50\r\n For every person on foot,                                           .25\r\n Public Stand,                                                       .50\r\n\r\n  ☞No person but a Member, or a resident of another State, invited by a\r\n  Member to purchase a Ticket, can have access to the Members’ Stand.\r\n  Any non-resident of New York, so invited, by paying three dollars, may\r\n  procure a Ticket, for the week, of admission to the Members’ Stand.\r\n\r\n  The Pavilion will be set apart for Ladies, Members of the Club, and\r\n  such Gentlemen only as have Tickets to the Members’ Stand.\r\n\r\n  ⁂An efficient Police is provided to preserve order, and see that the\r\n  Rules are strictly adhered to and enforced.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were accidently carried to the farm of Westhouses, where\r\nwe saw an extensive breeding stud of thoroughbred horses, amongst which\r\nwas a sister to Eclipse, the most celebrated horse in the States, and\r\nHenry, next in fame to Eclipse. The gentlemen of the turf consider their\r\nhorses superior to those of England, equal distances being run in less\r\ntime; but the style of running is, however, different, the weights of\r\nAmerica being lighter, and the horses pushed from the starting-post.\r\n\r\nWe experienced a most severe thunderstorm while at tea, but the young\r\nladies of the party did not seem to concern themselves about the war of\r\nelements, the most vivid lightnings flashing without remark. We\r\ntravelled a few miles after the storm abated, and daylight had\r\ndisappeared. The calls of toads and catydids were deafening, and\r\ninnumerable fire-flies illuminated the face of nature, and lighted our\r\nway. The wetness of the evening induced us to remain for the night at\r\nthe house of a friend, instead of returning to New York. Next morning I\r\nwas awoke from a sound sleep by a loud knocking at my bedroom window,\r\nand on answering the call, my disturber asked the hour. After looking at\r\nmy watch, I answered, twenty minutes past three o’clock, and added, he\r\nhad surely made a mistake in coming to me. He sharply answered, in a\r\ndisagreeable nasal twang, “I have slept too long, that is all the\r\nmistake, I guess.” In a few minutes afterwards, all hands, including\r\nseveral of the family, were engaged in milking cows; and the produce of\r\nabout twenty was despatched for New York before five o’clock, under\r\ncharge of the person who awoke me, and I learned that he had contracted\r\nfor the milk during the season. We breakfasted at six o’clock, and were\r\nimmediately afterwards drawn to the city by a pair of handsome chestnut\r\ngeldings, at the rate of eight miles an hour, and which would have\r\ngraced any barouche in Britain. Our vehicle was the common four-wheeled\r\nwaggon of the country, with two deals across for temporary seats, and it\r\nwas to return loaded with seed-potatoes. We drove smack up to the\r\nWashington Hotel, one of the most fashionable houses in the most\r\ncelebrated street in New York; and in course of our progress I was\r\namused at the uneasiness of my friend, one of the best and plainest of\r\nmen, at being carried to our residence in such a mean-looking carriage.\r\nDuring his short residence in the States, he had not learned to shake\r\noff that aristocratic feeling which so generally pervades human nature,\r\nand has produced much misery in the world.\r\n\r\nAfter changing our linens, we set out in a gig for Long Island,\r\nproceeding by way of Flushing, and returning by the beautiful village of\r\nJamaica. Long Island has been termed the garden of the States—a name\r\nwhich it may well merit from its numerous orchards, but certainly not\r\nfrom the fertility of the soil, or the management which it is under. The\r\nland is generally of light texture, requiring constant supplies of\r\nmanure, and a considerable part of it is sand of the poorest quality.\r\nThe enclosures were small, the fences bad, and every description of crop\r\ninferior. Parts of the surface were covered with thriftless brushwood,\r\nand there were numerous pools of water which might have been easily\r\ndrained. Many of the houses were composed of brick, others of wood,\r\nresembling the country-seats or villas of England. As a protection from\r\nthe sun’s rays, windows were generally provided with green Venetian\r\nblinds opening on the outside. Grave-yards, or private burying places,\r\nwere innumerable, and like the flower plots and gardens, kept in an\r\nuntidy manner.\r\n\r\nOn passing the village of Newtown, celebrated as the place where the\r\ndelicious apple bearing its name was first discovered, we drove into a\r\nshed, a convenience attached to every country place of entertainment in\r\nthe eastern United States, and after giving orders for the tending of\r\nour horse, applied at the bar of a respectable-looking hotel, if we\r\ncould have dinner. A thin vixen-looking woman peeped from behind a door,\r\nand whispered something to the landlord, who immediately told us, in a\r\ncivil tone of voice, he could not comply with the request, as they were\r\nengaged in cleaning the house. There was no alternative but to proceed,\r\nand on reaching a good-looking hotel at Flushing, about one o’clock, we\r\nlearned that the dinner hour was at two, but no objection was made to\r\naccommodate us immediately. Table was prepared by a pretty young woman,\r\ncalled, in this part of the world, a hired girl; and in less than a\r\nquarter of an hour from the time of our arrival, dinner was set before\r\nus. The same person, whom I consider entitled to the name of lady, being\r\nneat in dress, easy and polite in manners, waited during dinner in a\r\nstanding position. She conversed freely and sensibly on different\r\nsubjects, without forwardness or levity of conduct, and apologized for\r\npart of our fare not being so nice as it would have been, had time been\r\nallowed for preparation. On paying the bill, a gratuity was not\r\nproffered for her services, nor did she seem to expect it. The hostler,\r\nhowever, made a demand, and told us he did not receive wages from the\r\nmaster of the house, but depended entirely on travellers for\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries of Messrs Prince, the most extensive in America, are\r\nsituated at Flushing, and were visited by us. The grounds, compared with\r\nsuch places in Britain, and some others which I saw in America, seemed\r\nbadly kept, being full of perennial root-weeds of the most troublesome\r\ndescription, as well as those of annual growth.\r\n\r\nAgriculture being little known as a science in any part of America, and\r\nbut imperfectly understood as an art, the same diversity of opinion, and\r\nmode of management, prevail as in Britain, with greater difficulty of\r\nbecoming acquainted with them. The following particulars relate to the\r\nneighbourhood of New York.\r\n\r\nGrass crops are mown for hay five or six years in succession, without\r\nbeing top-dressed or manured in any way—the aftermath, which is seldom\r\nabundant, being depastured. Five pounds of red clover, and half a peck\r\nof timothy seeds (_Phileum pratense_), are sown on an acre; and also,\r\noccasionally, small quantities of herd-grass and redtop, two kinds of\r\npoea. I believe the red clover lives longer than it commonly does in the\r\ncultivated fields of Britain, having seen many plants after five\r\nsuccessive crops of hay. The grass, on being ploughed, is followed in\r\nthe first year by Indian corn without manure, by potatoes with manure in\r\nthe second year, and, if early, they are followed with buck-wheat;\r\nbarley is taken in the third year, and in the fourth, oats accompanied\r\nwith grass-seeds. Potatoes are grown in drills as in Britain, and\r\nsometimes in hills three or four feet distant, formed by the surface\r\nbeing marked into squares by the plough. A whole potato, or three\r\ncuttings, are placed above the manure, and both covered over with earth\r\nby the spade. Disease in the potato was said to be unknown. The fruit\r\ncrop is often injured by spring frosts, and wheat by mildew. Swede\r\nturnip is sown in August, and stored before winter. Geese are plucked\r\nthree times a-year—live goose feathers being a general article of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nFarm labourers, or helps, get from ten to twelve dollars a-month, with\r\nbed and board, including washing, and a deduction is made for sickness\r\nor voluntary absence. A married man is allowed from ninety-five to one\r\nhundred and twenty dollars a-year, instead of board; and pays from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five dollars for house and garden rent. The hours of\r\nlabour are from sunrise to sundown, without a specified time for meals,\r\nto which they are commonly summoned by sound of horn. Hired men do not\r\nconsider themselves bound for any length of time, and occasionally\r\nabsent themselves for a day or two without giving notice of their\r\nintention. Hired spade-men get seventy-five cents, or three-quarters of\r\na dollar per day, without board, all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from New York to Philadelphia—Steam-boat—Railway\r\n    Coach—Militia Muster—American and British Soldiers—Characters of\r\n    Travellers—Mansion-house Hotel—Funeral—Excursion to\r\n    Holmsburg—Hotel-keepers in America and Ireland—Mr W * *—Sir John\r\n    Sinclair of America—Fair Mount—Naval Yard—Philadelphia—Return to New\r\n    York—Face of the Country—Agricultural Details._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left New York in a steam-boat, a little after six o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and reached South Amboy, on Rariton bay, a distance of\r\ntwenty-eight miles, at half-past eight. From Amboy we travelled on a\r\nrailway to Bordentown, distant thirty-four miles, in carriages drawn by\r\ntwo horses, which were changed three times in four hours, and thence\r\ndown the Delaware river, by steam, to Philadelphia, where we arrived at\r\nthree o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe passengers breakfasted and dined on board the steam-boat, paying\r\nhalf a dollar (2s. 1½ d.) for each meal; no difference in charge or\r\naccommodation being made, and smoking in the cabin or after-part of the\r\nvessel was prohibited. There is a bar on board, at which liquors,\r\nsegars, maps, &c. &c., may be obtained. American steam-boats have been\r\ncompared to flourishing hotels, a term not sufficiently comprehensive,\r\nas they contain barbers, commodities of different kinds for sale, and\r\noften horses and carriages. They are floating cities.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving New York, the passengers were warned by bell to\r\npurchase breakfast tickets, and some time afterwards to identify their\r\nluggage, when all belonging to those proceeding to Philadelphia was\r\nplaced in a large crate, which was lifted from the steamer to a\r\ncarriage, and again to a steamer, by means of cranes, without its\r\ncontents being moved. The railway carriages rest on four wheels—are\r\ndivided into three compartments, each containing six persons, many of\r\nwhom are provided with tickets for their respective places before\r\nleaving the vessel. The horses were placed in sheds, ready harnessed, at\r\nthe different changing places, for greater expedition in attaching them\r\nto the carriages. Every arrangement in this line of travelling is\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nIn passing along the railway, the train of carriages stopped for a few\r\nminutes, which afforded us an opportunity of seeing a militia muster,\r\nwhich some writers have humorously described. The dresses of the men\r\nconsisted of all hues and shapes, there were hats with and without\r\nfeathers, and some garnished with roses. The guns consisted of single\r\nand double barrels, with not a few rifles amongst them. Many of the\r\ncorps were seen approaching the muster ground on horseback, and others\r\nin light waggons drawn by beautiful horses. The soldiers were,\r\ngenerally, small, thin, miserable-looking creatures, and such as would\r\nnot often have been enlisted in the British army. A young gentleman,\r\nlately arrived from England, and a fellow-passenger in the Napoleon and\r\nrailway coach, was quizzing the mean appearance of the militiamen, when\r\na blithe, jolly-looking fellow from Baltimore good-humouredly remarked,\r\nthat such men as these beat off the English at New Orleans; and some\r\nconversation on the relative merits of American and British soldiers\r\ntook place; the citizen of Baltimore was drawn into the question.\r\n\r\nWhether American or British soldiers are the best, will, I trust, long\r\nremain undecided by actual trial. There is, however, no doubt, that the\r\nBritish are apparently more muscular than the Americans, and I imagine\r\nalso more capable of enduring fatigue and privations. But large men do\r\nnot load muskets faster than those of smaller dimensions, while they are\r\nmore easily hit by a bullet. My ingenious friend W——, residing in the\r\nneighbourhood of Philadelphia, is of opinion, that the best fed army\r\nwill always prove conquerors, and attributes the success of the American\r\narmy and navy, last war, to the circumstance of the Americans having\r\nbeen better fed than the British. The influence of food in imparting\r\nstrength and courage to animals is well known, and, under a parity of\r\ncircumstances, the best fed army will prove victorious. But my friend’s\r\nargument, to be of weight, requires the British to have been under-fed,\r\na circumstance not likely to have occurred; but in American warfare,\r\nwhen men are often armed with rifles and masked by trees, strength and\r\ncourage are not brought into play. While the Americans fight in their\r\nown country, in defence of wives, families, and property,\r\nnotwithstanding their liberty and equality notions, and want of\r\ndiscipline, they will always prove an overmatch for hireling soldiers of\r\nany nation. But place them in a foreign land, amidst pestilence and\r\nprivation, with no incentives to exertion but a miserable pittance\r\ncalled pay and frivolous glory, I doubt if they would display deeds of\r\ngreatness and valour as Britons have often done.\r\n\r\nWe had not been long seated in the railway coach, when the Englishman\r\nbecame the butt of some Americans, who crammed him with such\r\nabsurdities, that he must have returned home, which he shortly intended\r\ndoing, with very erroneous ideas of the States; and the quickness with\r\nwhich his character was discovered by the Americans did credit to their\r\ndiscrimination. The tenor of a foreigner’s conversation with the natives\r\non his first arrival is an index to his understanding, and the\r\ninformation he receives is often made to accord with his capacity and\r\nfeelings instead of truth. Without sound judgment to discriminate and\r\nappreciate information, the gleanings and impressions of a traveller\r\nmust be as apt to mislead as instruct others, and his lucubrations will\r\noften be found more illustrative of his own character than of the people\r\nand country he visits. We took up our residence at the Mansion-house\r\nhotel, Philadelphia, kept by Mr Head; but it did not seem to warrant the\r\npraises bestowed on it by some travellers, meal hours not being\r\nregularly kept; and the bed of my friend was preoccupied by a set of\r\nmischievous natives, which fortunately in no instance paid their\r\nrespects to me.\r\n\r\nWhile walking after tea, a funeral passed by, which was the first I had\r\nseen on American soil. A hearse moved slowly along the side of the\r\nstreet, accompanied by about thirty men walking two and two on the\r\npavement, dressed in coloured clothes, without crape on hat or arm; then\r\nfollowed six or seven females, each supported by a gentleman, and both\r\nsexes were dressed in black garments, and seemed to be near relations of\r\nthe deceased; then came forty or fifty men and women in pairs, partly in\r\nblack and partly in coloured clothes, which closed the procession. I\r\nafterwards observed a funeral train at New York, composed entirely of\r\nmen, chiefly in coloured clothes, arranged in pairs. The custom of\r\nattending funerals in coloured clothes is said to be of recent\r\nintroduction; and as grief springs from the heart, and cannot be\r\nexpressed by hue of garment, this innovation on old custom is creditable\r\nas well as advantageous to the people.\r\n\r\nWishing to visit a gentleman residing fourteen miles from Philadelphia,\r\nto whom I had letters of introduction, the proprietor of the hotel\r\ndemanded five dollars, 21s. 3d., sterling, for a carriage to convey us\r\nto the place and back again by midday. The charge appearing\r\nunreasonable, I made application at several quarters, and at last\r\nengaged an Irishman on the street, who undertook the journey for three\r\ndollars, and he fulfilled his engagement to our perfect satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNext morning, we left Philadelphia at an early hour, and on reaching\r\nHolmsburg, were refused breakfast at an unpretending hotel, without a\r\nreason being assigned. On applying, however, at another hotel on the\r\nopposite side of the street, we were more fortunate, and had every thing\r\nset before us which could appease hunger or gratify the palate. The\r\nrefusal of breakfast reminded me of being in Ireland in 1830; on which\r\noccasion I was accompanied by a friend. We travelled from Drogheda to\r\nKells, in the county of Meath, in a common car of the country, exposed\r\nto a burning sun, and choking dust. On reaching that lovely village, and\r\nalighting at an inn, we were told the Marquis of —— was momently\r\nexpected, on which account we could not be accommodated, and at a second\r\ninn experienced the same disagreeable reception. I exerted the little\r\neloquence with which Nature has endowed me to obtain a single room, and\r\nafter despairing of success, I petitioned for a stall in the stable. The\r\nheart of mine hostess was so far overcome as to provide tea, and allow\r\nus to wash in a dirty miserable-looking room. I here despatched a card\r\nto a landed proprietor in the neighbourhood by an errand-boy of the\r\nhouse. This circumstance changed the state of affairs all of a sudden;\r\nbut I withdrew to the house of my friend in the country. The great man\r\ndid not make his appearance that evening; yet the mere expectation of\r\nhis arrival deprived us of food and shelter. What a miserable state of\r\nsociety!\r\n\r\nThe tavern-keepers of Ireland, and those of Newton and Holmsburg, seem\r\nto have been actuated by very different motives. Both were culpably\r\nunaccommodating; but those of America, probably, acted from saucy\r\nindependence—those of Ireland, from greedy and needy dependence. Paddy\r\nwished to fawn on the rich man, and enjoy the crumbs which fell from his\r\nestablishment; while Jonathan indulged his own humour, and disregarded\r\ncrumbs of every kind.\r\n\r\nJust as we approached Mr W——’s, rain began to fall, and prevented our\r\nexamination of his farm, which I much regretted. Our stay, however, was\r\nprolonged till after dinner, having been fascinated by the sentiments of\r\nhis powerful and original mind. Besides acquiring much useful\r\ninformation regarding the United States generally, I learned the\r\nadvantages of introductory letters, which I too lightly esteemed, from\r\nthe circumstance of having, when a young man, travelled over a\r\nconsiderable portion of England without such credentials, and obtained\r\naccess to whatever interested me, by stating, either verbally or in\r\nwriting, the object of my visit. Mrs W—— asked me if I had a friend\r\nnamed Flanagan, and on being answered in the negative, added, that a\r\nperson, passing by that name, introduced himself to her husband as my\r\nbosom friend, and in consequence received considerable attention for\r\nseven or eight months, at the end of which he decamped, without paying\r\nhis debts. On reflection, I recollected having received and answered two\r\nletters from a person of that name in the north of Ireland, which formed\r\nthe extent of our intercourse. Introductory letters have become so\r\ncommon of late years, that in many quarters they are treated with\r\nneglect. They ate perhaps unnecessary to liberal-minded men, and only\r\nuseful to guard against imposition.\r\n\r\nReturning to Philadelphia in the afternoon, I delivered an introductory\r\nletter to an eminent individual, who had been described to me as the Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair of America, which appellation I found he well merited. A\r\ndirty-looking girl opened the door of a house in one of the principal\r\nstreets, and desired me to occupy a seat in the passage until —— came\r\ndown stairs. The passage was about five feet wide by forty in length,\r\nand so dark that objects were not distinctly visible in the lightest\r\npart of it; and in this hole, on a plain wooden chair, I sat for upwards\r\nof a quarter of an hour before the gentleman made his appearance. During\r\nthis interval of suspense, I debated with myself the indignity offered\r\nme according to British notions, and whether I ought to leave my dungeon\r\nin disgust; but on reflection I resolved to submit to any thing, short\r\nof insult and imposition, that might come in the way, whilst amongst the\r\nAmericans, for the double purpose of seeing character and ensuring\r\npersonal comfort—knowing how disagreeable it would be to act at variance\r\nwith the manners and customs of a nation, and vain to expect to bring\r\nthe population to my way of thinking on such matters. The gentleman at\r\nlast made his appearance, and conducted me to a room, without saying a\r\nsingle word about the delay he had occasioned, or the situation in which\r\nI had been placed; and from his manners being easy and polite, I was led\r\nto conjecture that sitting in the dark lobby was a common occurrence\r\nwith his visitors. My reception was flattering, his offers of service\r\nextensive, and conversation, which was chiefly agricultural, more fluent\r\nthan profound.\r\n\r\nRain continued to fall in torrents during the night and next day, which\r\nprevented us visiting the celebrated botanic gardens belonging to\r\nColonel Ker, to whom we had letters. With the aid of a street coach, we,\r\nhowever, reached Fair Mount, where public works which supply the city\r\nwith water are situated. The machinery is propelled by water from the\r\nriver, part of which is raised to an elevated reservoir, from which the\r\ncity receives a copious supply for every purpose. The reservoir is\r\nsurrounded by a pale fence, enclosing well-kept walks, accessible by\r\nflights of steps. The beauty of the spot and surrounding scenery deserve\r\na visit from every person of taste, even although they disregard the\r\nmachinery of the works.\r\n\r\nFrom Fair Mount we drove to the Naval Yard, which we reached just as the\r\nworkmen were leaving it to dine, during which time visitors are\r\nexcluded. The sentinel on duty enquired if we were foreigners, and on\r\nlearning that we were, conveyed information to his superior in command,\r\nbut on his return informed us we could not be admitted. While we\r\nlamented being too late to see the Naval Yard, the justness of our\r\nexclusion was fully admitted.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia contains about 170,000 inhabitants, is the second place in\r\npopulation and the fourth in shipping within the United States, and\r\nforms the _depôt_ to a county yearly increasing in population, wealth,\r\nand extent. It is situated on the west bank of the Delaware river, which\r\nis navigated by vessels of the largest size. Many of the streets are\r\nshaded with trees, and all of them remarkably clean and well paved,\r\nrunning parallel and at right angles to each other. The houses are\r\ngenerally built of red brick, those of some of the principal streets\r\nhaving the basement, steps, door, and window sides of white marble. The\r\ndoors are in general painted white, and have silver handles and\r\nknockers. Houses of this description have a chaste and pleasing\r\nappearance. Many of the public buildings are elegant, and composed of\r\nwhite marble. The city is generally considered regular, to a fault—the\r\ninhabitants the most wealthy, fashionable, and polished in America.\r\n\r\nThe weather continuing wet, we left Philadelphia for New York at three\r\no’clock in the afternoon, passing the night at Perth Amboy, where we\r\npaid a charge of threepence sterling for cleaning boots, and reached New\r\nYork next morning. The railway from Amboy to Bordentown passes chiefly\r\nthrough Middlesex county, state of New Jersey. The soil is absolutely\r\ndrift sand, and, according to my present notions of farming, unworthy of\r\ncultivation. The crops consisted chiefly of rye and Indian corn, and\r\nwere uniformly bad. Clovers and timothy grass are seldom sown. In\r\nseveral instances lime and gypsum had been applied where Indian corn was\r\ngrowing, having been carried to the field in waggons, and spread thinly\r\nover the surface. In one instance farmyard manure was being applied in\r\nimperfectly formed drills, which I supposed were destined to receive\r\npotatoes. Women were seen hoeing Indian corn in the fields, but I could\r\nnot discover whether they were white or coloured. The cattle grazing on\r\nthe scanty herbage appeared mere starvelings, and smaller than some of\r\nthe Highland cattle of Scotland. The sheep were even more\r\nmiserable-looking than the cattle, and many of them retained their\r\nwinter fleece. Pigs corresponded with the sheep and cattle; the horse\r\nalone forming an exception to the general wretchedness, some noble\r\nanimals of this species being met with. Many orchards, consisting\r\nchiefly of peach-trees, the fruit of which is distilled into brandy, had\r\nbeen lately formed, and seemed the only thriving thing on the surface of\r\nthe earth. The men seen at the militia muster, already noticed, are\r\ninhabitants of this district, and appeared to partake of its character.\r\n\r\nWhen passing along the railway, I was much struck with the beauty of a\r\nplant, bearing a profusion of pink-coloured flowers, which the rapidity\r\nof motion prevented me seeing distinctly; and on asking its name, one\r\npassenger guessed it to be lauristinus and another hawthorn, but which I\r\nsoon discovered to be rhododendron. This plant grows in great profusion\r\nalong the road, and more especially around the seat of Joseph Bonaparte,\r\nnear Bordentown.\r\n\r\nThe country around Philadelphia through which we passed, forms a\r\nstriking contrast to that of New Jersey; its general aspect resembling,\r\nin all respects, the finest parts of the south of England. Many of the\r\nfences consist of well-kept thorn-hedges, studded with wide spreading\r\ntrees; and many of the crops were excellent, although the soil is not\r\ngenerally in a high state of cultivation. The trees were covered with\r\nmassy rich foliage, superior to any thing I had ever witnessed\r\nbefore—the effects of which were heightened by the season of the year\r\nand prevailing weather, which was warm and moist. Here and there a few\r\npollard trees were seen raising their thin tops and branchless trunks\r\namidst the glorious exuberance of nature; and when viewed in the\r\nlandscape with the weeping willow, queen of American vegetation, the\r\ntendrils of which, clothed with shining leaves, hang in graceful\r\nfestoons thirty feet in length, show how destitute of beauty are the\r\nworks of man when compared with those of nature.\r\n\r\nMen assisting at farm-work, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, get\r\nfrom ten to twelve dollars, with maintenance, per month, and they are\r\nnot easily obtained to attend regularly at work. Young men and women of\r\nthe industrious classes in the country dress in fashionable clothes of\r\nthe finest fabrics before marriage, after which, the wife becomes a\r\nlady, and generally engages a hired girl or help. Thrashing machines are\r\ncommon, but not good; and when the flail is used, barley and oats cost\r\nthree cents, rye seven cents, and wheat twelve and a half cents per\r\nbushel, when found,—that is, food provided for the workmen. From the\r\nhigh price of human labour, compared with the price of food, Indian corn\r\nis often trod out by oxen. Craddlers generally mow round the field when\r\nthe crop admits of doing so; and stop only when the scythe requires to\r\nbe sharped. Hay costs in cutting from one to one and a half dollar per\r\nacre. Mr W—— pointed out a field of rye which was a good crop, and which\r\nhe had a few days before let to be craddled at seventy-five cents per\r\nacre, without board or any other etcetera. The craddler not being\r\npermitted to sit at table with the family, and disliking to eat in the\r\nkitchen, had agreed to board with one of Mr W——’s labourers for\r\nforty-five cents per day, and would be thus fed, viz. breakfast at seven\r\no’clock, on wheat-bread, rye-bread, fish, cheese, butter, and coffee;\r\nluncheon at ten o’clock, on cold meat, pickled pork, cheese, butter,\r\npickles, bread, and coffee; dine at twelve, on every thing that is good\r\nand substantial; at five is served coffee, with bread, butter, fruit,\r\nand fruit-pie. Occasionally supper is taken at seven, but this meal is\r\nconsidered superfluous. Mr W—— thinks Americans perform a great deal\r\nmore work than Englishmen, which he attributes to their being better\r\nfed. At the conclusion of my transatlantic tour, my opinion is, the\r\ninhabitants of America do not work near so much as those of Britain\r\nthroughout the week or year, although they may, perhaps, do more in a\r\nday. The strength and expertness of workmen seems a favourite idea—those\r\nof every district which I have visited being accounted by the\r\ninhabitants the best in the world. But the climate of England being\r\nbetter fitted for exertion than that of America, and the apparent health\r\nand strength of Englishmen superior, I can discover no reason why they\r\nshould do less work than the Americans. Men and animals may be\r\nconsidered machines capable of manufacturing or yielding labour\r\naccording as they are fed, provided their powers be not weakened by\r\nexcess, or other circumstances affecting health. The half-starved,\r\npotato-fed Irishman could no more keep pace during a day’s work with the\r\nmeat-eating American, than the grass-fed steed with one trained on corn\r\nand hay. It is shortsighted policy in a master to pinch his labourer of\r\nfood, when he reaps the fruits of his exertions.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, land of fine quality and in high\r\ncondition, may be had from 100 to 120 dollars per acre. Produce of all\r\ndescriptions is high, and the straw of a wheat crop has been sold at\r\nthirty dollars per acre. Wheat is often mildewed. I saw several fields\r\nof a newly introduced grass, called Andes grass, said to have been\r\nlately brought from the range of hills in South America bearing that\r\nname. On examining the plant in the fields, and the seed in the shops, I\r\nthink it is identical with the small-bulbed oat-like grass (_Holcus\r\navenceus_ of Sinclair) indigenous to Britain, and which I afterwards\r\nobserved growing in a state of nature in different parts of New York\r\nState. Much has been said and written in exaggeration of Mr W——’s system\r\nof farming; and he seemed highly amused when told of their nature. He\r\ngrows excellent Swede turnip after his wheat crop, and this is the only\r\nsuccession of crops he gets in one year. His system is to plough in\r\ngreen vegetable matter, such as clover aftermath, French beans, and\r\nIndian corn, for manure to other crops. Horses and cattle are soiled\r\nwith green food in summer, farming operations appeared to be well\r\nexecuted, and every thing connected with the establishment was in good\r\norder. Mr W. takes charge of agricultural pupils for 300 dollars a-year;\r\nand, from my visit to this gentleman, I think him eminently qualified\r\nfor imparting knowledge to them. Young boys are often apprenticed to\r\nfarmers for four years, with a stipulation of getting a quarter’s\r\nschooling each year of their apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  _New York—Damask hair-cloth manufactory—Dr H——, President Jackson, and\r\n    Black Hawk—Hyde Park—Residences in America and Britain—Taste for\r\n    Flowers—Cattle and Sheep—Scenery of the Hudson and Clyde—Fast\r\n    Eating—Albany—Coach Passengers—Women working in Fields._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral days were spent in viewing the beauties of New York and its\r\nneighbourhood, which the works of recent travellers render unnecessary\r\nfor me to describe at length. This city is the first city in the Union,\r\nboth as to shipping and population, which does not perhaps fall much\r\nshort of two hundred and forty thousand. It is situated on an island\r\nseparated from the mainland by a small creek passing betwixt the north\r\nand east rivers, which some individuals failed in converting into a\r\ncanal. From the site of New York as an emporium of trade, there seem to\r\nbe no limits to the extension of the city and its suburbs. It is already\r\nthe chief outlet of much of the produce of the eastern parts of the New\r\nEngland states, part of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and almost the whole of\r\nNew York State. When the canals and railways now in progress are\r\ncompleted, it will also become the depôt for part of the produce of the\r\nstates of Indiana, Illinois, and the unsurveyed country to the west of\r\nLake Michigan, traversed by the rivers Mississippi and Missouri; and, in\r\nthe course of events, Upper Canada may be added to the list. The mouth\r\nof the Mississippi seems the only outlet, calculated by the extent of\r\ninland navigation, to vie with New York; but the warm and pestilential\r\nnature of the climate unfits it for the reception of produce, and the\r\nresidence of man. The public and private buildings vary in size and\r\nelegance; and the inhabitants are justly proud of Waverley and Lafayette\r\nPlaces, the houses of the latter being decorated with immense Corinthian\r\npillars, and the whole fronts and steps consist of marble. The streets\r\nare not so clean as the inhabitants wish strangers to believe; but as\r\nswine seem, in part, intrusted with the charge of removing the filth,\r\nthey are in as good order as might be expected. The streets appear to be\r\nthronged at all hours, noise and uproar prevailing when I retired for\r\nthe night; ladies and gentlemen on horseback, and the industrious on\r\nfoot, were bustling forth at five in the morning when I arose. Emblems\r\nof aristocratic pride and shameless mendicity occasionally met the eye,\r\nin the red vests and peculiar cut coats of serving men standing at the\r\nback of luxurious carriages, and in the extended hat supplicating\r\ncharity. Like other large commercial and manufacturing towns, activity\r\ncharacterises the inhabitants by day, dissipation by night.\r\n\r\nAt Johnston and Green’s manufactory I saw a newly invented fabric of\r\ngreat beauty—damask hair-cloth, consisting of different patterns, the\r\nraised figures being sometimes of silk and sometimes of linen. A patent\r\nhas been obtained for making this stuff, both in the States and in\r\nEngland. It forms a beautiful covering for sofas and chairs, and is said\r\nto be durable. I paid one dollar for the linen, and two for the silk\r\ndamask, per yard, in small quantities. About two hundred people are\r\nemployed at the manufactory, and, at the time I saw them, they all\r\nappeared happy, healthy, and clean. Young women, when weaving by the\r\npiece, earned three dollars (13s. 8d.) per week; small boys, six and\r\nseven years of age, one dollar; the hours of labour being from six in\r\nthe morning to seven at night, with intervals of half an hour for\r\nbreakfast, and an hour for dinner.\r\n\r\nHaving forwarded an introductory letter to Dr H——, who, on my arrival at\r\nNew York, was at his country-seat, I had intimation of his return to\r\ntown a week afterwards. On calling upon the Doctor at his friend’s house\r\nin —— Street, I was ushered into the drawingroom by a tawdry-looking\r\ngirl, without announcing my name. My reception was all I could have\r\nwished; and on learning my intended movements, he expressed regret at\r\nnot being able to be at —— by the day mentioned, and expecting General\r\nJackson, the President, to visit —— in course of his tour, already\r\ncommenced, proposed that I should wait and form one of the party. There\r\nis no ruler of any portion of the earth I would so soon associate with\r\nas a President of the United States of America, chosen by a free and\r\nenlightened people, to administer their laws; but the task which I had\r\nimposed upon myself did not warrant delay in an indulgence of\r\nfeeling,—forming part of the President’s tail, being unconnected with\r\nthe objects of my excursion. I had no reason to regret this act of\r\nself-denial, the conduct of the people and President during the tour\r\nbeing such as I could not admire.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson having resolved to visit the chief towns in the northern\r\nparts of the Union, he got as far as Boston, when he was compelled by\r\nfatigue to return to Washington. In every town his deportment and\r\nreception seemed an imitation of the rules of despotic countries—a\r\nspectacle to the crowd, and an object of extravagant devotion. An Indian\r\nchief, named Black Hawk, who had been taken prisoner the preceding year,\r\nin a war to the west of Lake Michigan, and who was carried through some\r\nof the great towns, with a view of impressing him with the power of the\r\nStates, preparatory to his liberation, arrived at New York the day after\r\nthe President, and divided public attention. The ladies declared in\r\nfavour of Black Hawk, some of them actually kissing him, which, it is\r\nsaid, affected the old President’s health. The chief of the white men,\r\nand the chief of the red, were alike objects of curiosity; the President\r\nholding a levee by day, the Hawk by night, in Niblo’s gardens. Had a\r\nmammoth or elephant appeared, the mighty ones of the earth would have\r\nbeen eclipsed in public favour.\r\n\r\nWe left New York early in the morning, by the Albany steam-boat, for\r\nHyde Park, after viewing which we returned to the landing-place on the\r\nriver Hudson, and, at half-past twelve at night, stept on board of a\r\nsteam-boat which landed us at Albany a little after seven next morning.\r\nI got on deck at four, when passing the town of Hudson; the wind was\r\nblowing high from the north, and piercingly cold.\r\n\r\nHyde Park, the seat of Doctor Hosack, is the most celebrated in America,\r\nand which Mr Stuart describes as being “embellished as a fine residence\r\nand fine grounds in England.” The house is situated some hundreds of\r\nfeet above the level of, and at a considerable distance from the Hudson,\r\nthe intervening grounds being finely undulating. In front of the house\r\nthere is a road, leading from the landing-place on the river, along a\r\nsmall stream, over which there is an elegant wooden bridge, and several\r\nartificial cascades have been formed in its channel. The house is\r\ncomposed of wood, as well as the offices and lodges, painted white, and\r\nare very neat of their kind. The conservatory had been dismantled a few\r\ndays before our arrival, by placing the plants in the open air; the\r\ncollection seemed extensive and well kept. The flower garden is small,\r\nthe walks limited, and both destitute of beauty. I am aware that most of\r\nthe evergreens which impart loveliness to the residences in Britain\r\ncannot withstand the rigours of an American winter, but this\r\ncircumstance is no excuse for the nakedness of Hyde Park walks, the aid\r\nof many native plants having been disregarded. The matchless beauties of\r\nthe situation have not only been frequently neglected, but destroyed by\r\nstiff, formal, naked walks, and the erection of temples resembling\r\nmeat-safes, without a climbing plant, which the country produces in\r\nendless variety, to hide their deformity, and harmonize them with the\r\nsurrounding scene. In short, while I greatly admired the situation of\r\nHyde Park, I do not recollect having seen a celebrated place where\r\nnature had done so much, and man so little, to render beautiful. The\r\nembellishments at Hyde Park, contrasted with those met with every day in\r\nBritain, place American landscape-gardening immeasurably behind, if it\r\ncan be said to exist.\r\n\r\nThe progress of a people in refinement and taste, manifested in a\r\ncombination of nature and art, is commonly the work of time, and the\r\ndecoration of grounds an unproductive investment of capital. Thus the\r\nresidences of England having descended for ages in the same line,\r\nwithout the power of possessors changing their destination, may be said\r\nto represent the accumulated savings, labours, and tastes of many\r\ngenerations. In America the country has not been long possessed by the\r\npresent owners, and property does not necessarily descend in the same\r\nline; and if to these causes be added the high price of labour, and the\r\nscarcity of capital, the state of the residences will be sufficiently\r\naccounted for. Dr Hosack has great merit in what he has accomplished,\r\nbut it is mockery to compare his grounds, in point of embellishments,\r\nwith the fine places in Britain, which have originated from\r\ncircumstances which America is not likely soon to experience.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of my transatlantic tour, the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry manifested perfect indifference to the beauties of nature. It\r\nwas rarely I could learn the name of a plant, with the exception of\r\ntrees. Nurserymen, seedsmen, and farmers were, generally, unacquainted\r\nwith varieties, and, with exception of two or three individuals, no one\r\nseemed interested in the matter. Rhododendrons grow as plentifully in\r\nmany parts of the Eastern States as furze in Britain, yet I saw vast\r\nnumbers of this plant shipping at Liverpool for Philadelphia, although\r\nmillions of the same variety could have been obtained for the trouble of\r\nlifting, at no great distance from the city. Gardens and nurseries were\r\noverrun with weeds, and did not display beauty either in decoration or\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nHyde Park is also celebrated for its agriculture, which I found under\r\nthe charge of a gentleman from Fifeshire, Scotland, a person on\r\nexcellent terms with himself. The farm offices, which are extensive,\r\nwould be considered good in most situations, and were the best I saw in\r\nAmerica. There was a young hawthorn hedge, well kept, and in a thriving\r\nstate. The cattle consist of imported short-horns, or their descendants,\r\nand one or two of the best cows were tolerable specimens of that breed.\r\nThe sheep were said to be a mixture of the Leicester and Cotswold\r\nbreeds; the pure blood of the former not having been found to answer.\r\nThe flock was miserably low in condition, and the ewes were followed by\r\nlarge, though not fat-looking, lambs.\r\n\r\nHowever well the short-horned breed of cattle, and improved Leicester\r\nsheep, may have been found to answer in some parts of Britain, it is\r\ndoubtful if the farmers of the State of New York will benefit themselves\r\nby introducing them. The one is remarkable for lack of dairy produce,\r\nand the other for inferior quality of mutton; and both for being\r\nunprofitable, unless liberally supplied at all seasons with nutritious\r\nfood. The population of the country cannot well dispense with any part\r\nof their present dairy produce, and do not require an increase of\r\nquantity at a sacrifice of quality of mutton, while the present state of\r\nagriculture does not furnish a sufficiency of food for the health and\r\ngrowth of short-horns and Leicesters during winter. I imagine smaller\r\nand more hardy breeds, of both kinds of stock, will be found more\r\nprofitable for general purposes.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence at New York, I attended the cattle market, which was\r\nstored with moderately fatted cattle, many of which had been worked. I\r\nalso witnessed a herd of two hundred passing along the streets, said to\r\nhave come from the state of Kentucky, forming part of four thousand\r\nwhich had been bought by one company, and brought forward in weekly\r\nsupplies. They bore some resemblance to the Hereford cattle of\r\nEngland—were four and five years old, of excellent quality, and were\r\nestimated to average eighty stones dead weight, of 14 lbs. to the stone.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Hudson did not realize my expectations on first view,\r\nan occurrence which frequently takes place when much has previously been\r\nheard in praise of objects. Every person of observation must have\r\nremarked how different scenery appears under a change of circumstances.\r\nThe weather being cold and raw during the passage, affected, perhaps, my\r\nfeelings; and it was not until the objects had been seen a second time\r\nin the beginning of November, that I became sensible of their beauties.\r\nThe Palisadoes, a line of rocks extending for twenty miles on the west\r\nside of the river on leaving New York, are of moderate height, with\r\ntheir base covered with stunted trees, and convey nothing of the sublime\r\nto the beholder. The objects became more interesting on approaching the\r\nhigh lands where Anthony’s nose is situated, and forms the most\r\nprominent and beautiful feature. The channel of the river seems to have\r\nbeen produced by a mighty convulsion; the banks being destitute of soil,\r\nand the islands masses of pure rock, which strikingly display the\r\neconomy and beauty of nature—the islands, without a particle of soil or\r\nblade of grass, being thickly studded with healthy, though small trees,\r\nwhile the perpendicular rocks on the banks, from the water’s edge to\r\nmany hundred feet in height, were adorned with blossomed kalmias.\r\n\r\nThe margins of the river Hudson, and islands in its course, assume a\r\ndifferent character on approaching Albany; the islands being depositions\r\nof mud, susceptible of cultivation, and the banks rich soil, bearing\r\ngood crops, and adorned with pretty houses.\r\n\r\nThe tide flows up the Hudson to Albany, distant from New York 144 miles,\r\nadmitting vessels of considerable burden, and sloops of small size\r\npenetrate much farther up the river. The waters of the Hudson, passing\r\nthrough a rich and populous country, forming the outlet of the Erie\r\nCanal, present a never-ending scene of pleasing industry. At all times\r\ninnumerable sailing vessels, with extended cotton canvass, whitened by a\r\nbright sun, and pure air, float gracefully to and fro. Steam-boats,\r\ncrowded with passengers, pass with rapidity, while cock-boats, loaded\r\nwith fish, poultry, and fruit, rest in quietness. Sloops carrying\r\nwell-formed hay and straw stacks, glide towards New York, while\r\nsteam-boats tow canal barges and vessels of every description, up and\r\ndown the river. The surrounding country is also full of interest,\r\nabounding in thriving villages and towns, each forming a depôt to the\r\ncountry in their rear; besides villas, academies, hotels, prisons, and\r\nforts without number, associated with the history, literature, and\r\nimprovement of the country. To a citizen of the States, the Hudson is\r\nthe most interesting, beautiful, and important river in America, and no\r\nforeigner of taste can be insensible to its charms.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the river Clyde, in my native country, is of a different\r\ncharacter. In vegetable decoration, the banks of the Clyde are greatly\r\ninferior to those of the Hudson, as well as in soft and picturesque\r\nbeauty, although some sweet landscapes, such as the bay of Rothesay, are\r\nfound on the former. But the Hudson is altogether wanting in the rugged\r\nblue mountains, so conspicuous from the Clyde, which are the most noble\r\nand awe-inspiring objects of nature. I know not whether it is taste or\r\nprejudice which makes me prefer the scenery of the Clyde to the Hudson.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Albany, the bustle and confusion on board the steam-boat,\r\nwith passengers landing, and porters scrambling for the luggage, was\r\nexcessive; and there was some difficulty in preserving unauthorized\r\nhands from carrying away our effects. We reached the Columbian hotel\r\nrather late for breakfast; after which we walked about the town. Things\r\nappeared very different from what New York presented: carts, waggons,\r\nand carriages, as well as the animals harnessed to them, were greatly\r\ninferior. The population did not appear so active, and the eye looked in\r\nvain for those ladies whose fashionable attire, interesting\r\ncountenances, and elegance of feet and ankles, delight the beholder. Our\r\ndinner party consisted of upwards of sixty. One gentleman dined in five\r\nminutes, reckoned by my stop-watch; the ladies rose from the table at\r\nthe end of twelve; dinner and dessert occupied about fifteen minutes.\r\nThe affair seemed an eating race, and my companions not being aware of\r\nthe rapidity of the pace, were sadly behind. I was amused at a little\r\njockeyship displayed in the contest. An individual, as soon as he seated\r\nhimself at table, emptied a dish of green pease on his plate, to the\r\nevident disappointment of a gentleman on his right hand, and when a\r\nfresh supply appeared, he performed the like feat a second time,\r\nalthough part of the first seizure was unconsumed. Few of the party\r\ndrank wine during dinner, and very little of the brandy which stood on\r\nthe table, for the use of the company, was used. At tea, a gentleman\r\nremoved from table in four minutes, but the party generally sat as long\r\nas at dinner.\r\n\r\nAlbany is the capital of the state of New York, containing about twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, and has lately been made a port of entry. From\r\nbeing situated near the outlet of the Erie Canal, which is the channel\r\nof commerce with the country to the west and north, and on the line of\r\nrailway now in progress, which will soon connect Boston with Lake Erie,\r\nit is almost certain to rise into importance. It is at present a place\r\nof considerable trade, being the seventh or eighth in the union.\r\n\r\nBetwixt dinner and tea I took an opportunity of delivering a letter of\r\nintroduction to a gentleman residing a little to the north of Albany,\r\navailing myself of a railway coach proceeding to Schenectady. I chose\r\npart of an outside place behind, sufficient to accommodate five\r\nindividuals of ordinary size, and which was occupied by two beings,\r\nhalf-men, half-boys, sitting cross-legged, and who, by their position\r\nand expression of countenance, seemed resolved not to admit a third\r\nperson. After waiting for some time without speaking a word, I made\r\npreparations for taking a place between them; and at last their legs\r\nwere only withdrawn to escape the weight of my body. I notice this\r\ncircumstance, trivial in itself, as being the only instance where\r\nrudeness, or want of an accommodating spirit was manifested by\r\ntravellers in the course of my American tour. The gentleman I called on\r\nbeing from home, I returned by the fields to Albany. On my way I saw a\r\ngrey coloured fox, which appeared larger, and not so active as the red\r\nfox of Britain. I observed several women engaged in the fields in\r\nweeding, cutting, and planting potatoes, and none of them seemed in\r\npoverty, or tinged with black blood. Mr Stuart, in his “Three Years’\r\nResidence in America,” says, women are not allowed to work in the\r\nfields, without saying whether the prohibition arises from custom or by\r\nlaw. Women are actively employed in different occupations when their\r\nservices are wanted, which does not, however, often occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Albany to Boston—New Lebanon—Pittsfield—Road\r\n    Repairing—The Features of the Country—Rhododendrons—Northampton—Mr\r\n    Stuart’s Description of Northampton—Stage Passengers—Mode of\r\n    Courtship—Villages—Agricultural Notices._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy companions and I having left Scotland without fixing on a route by\r\nwhich we were to proceed, I consented to visit the New England States,\r\nin order that I might claim their company through the Western States, to\r\nwhich they expressed an aversion. Accordingly we left Albany at two\r\no’clock in the morning, by a stage which carried the mail-bag, crossing\r\nthe Hudson in a horse ferry-boat, and reaching Nassau, by five, where we\r\nbreakfasted on indifferent fare. Shortly afterwards we passed New\r\nLebanon, finely situated in a lovely valley, surrounded by picturesque\r\nhills, a great part of which belongs to the religious sect denominated\r\nShakers, whose principal establishment is here, and whose garden seeds\r\nare justly esteemed throughout North America. New Lebanon is celebrated\r\nfor mineral waters, chiefly used for bathing; and the hotels afford\r\nample accommodation for visitors. Nine miles beyond New Lebanon is the\r\nvillage of Pittsfield, a clean and beautiful village, reposing in a\r\ncharming valley. The houses form a spacious square, in the centre of\r\nwhich is a tall aged elm, seemingly a remnant of unsubdued nature. There\r\nare several churches and hotels. Here the members of the Berkshire\r\nAgricultural Society, the oldest in America, hold their meetings, the\r\nfirst show of which took place in 1807, and consisted of two Merino\r\nsheep. We dined at Peru, a miserable country hotel, where bad fare was\r\nwashed down by worse tea, the first time such a beverage had been\r\npresented to us during dinner, and is presented only in inferior hotels.\r\nWe reached Northampton about six in the evening, having travelled\r\nseventy-seven miles in sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nThis day’s travelling afforded opportunities of seeing the American\r\nsystem of road-mending, or more correctly speaking, road-destroying. A\r\nplough, drawn by four, and occasionally six oxen, with two drivers, one\r\nman holding by the stilts, and another standing on the beam, is passed\r\nalong the margins of the road, turning every fifty yards. The loosened\r\nearth is then moved to the centre of the road, by men with shovels, or\r\nby a levelling-box drawn by oxen, the stones, great and small, being\r\nfirst carefully removed from amongst the earth, and in many instances\r\nmore were thrown aside than sufficient to Macadamize the road.\r\n\r\nThe country from Albany, has not an agricultural feature worthy of\r\nnotice, the soil being chiefly poor sand, interspersed with rocks and\r\ninnumerable stones. The crops were truly miserable, and the pastures\r\nthinly clothed with sheep and cattle, which were invariably lean. Some\r\nbeautiful cows were seen at Northampton, apparently descended from the\r\nNorth Devon breed of England.\r\n\r\nThe road in several places was so hilly that the stage passengers walked\r\non foot, which afforded an opportunity of examining much that was\r\ninteresting. This was one of the happiest days of my life, almost every\r\nmoving and stationary thing on the earth’s surface being new to me, and\r\nthe weather fitted for displaying them to the best advantage.\r\nStrawberries of different kinds were gathered, tasted, and their seeds\r\npreserved. Shrubs and flowers were culled and compared. Insects and\r\nbirds seemed to vie with each other in displaying brilliant colours;\r\nsquirrels and woodpeckers of every hue were sporting around the trunks\r\nof aged trees, and the snakes were basking in the glorious sunbeams.\r\nNature seemed in jubilee.\r\n\r\nThe forests through which the road led were strewed with decayed and\r\ndecaying trees of former ages, and at the same time exhibited living\r\nspecimens of each variety in every stage of growth, from the seedling\r\nbudding into existence, to the aged pine, bearing the white and flowing\r\ntresses of Spanish moss, so emblematical of hoary and declining man. The\r\nflowers of rhododendrons and kalmias were unexpanded on the highest\r\nridges, and opening into beauty in the valleys below, illustrative of\r\nthe effect of elevation on climate. These plants were growing in all\r\nsituations, on rocks, deep rich soil, beneath trees, and on exposed\r\nbanks of rivers. The kalmias with bright red flowers, and white and pink\r\nblossomed varieties of rhododendron, were mingled in pleasing groups.\r\n\r\nNear Northampton some snow-white rhododendrons, twelve feet in height,\r\nrich in blossoms and foliage, were shading cows browsing on the banks of\r\nthe river, where decaying trunks of pine-trees stood in picturesque\r\ncombination, like ruins of an ancient castle. After partaking of tea at\r\nan excellent hotel, we walked forth to survey the village, which is\r\nreckoned the most beautiful in New England. Northampton is extremely\r\nirregular, branching into roads leading in all directions. The houses\r\nare composed of wood painted white, with green Venetian blinds. The\r\ncongregational church is a handsome structure, of the same hue and\r\nmaterials as the houses, and cannot fail to attract the notice of\r\nstrangers, being one of the best specimens of wood and paint that the\r\nUnited States afford. The ranges of houses are enveloped in trees,\r\namongst which are many magnificent elms, members perhaps of the original\r\nforest, reducing modern vegetation to insignificance, and affording\r\numbrageous shelter to the inhabitants. The village stands in the rich\r\nvalley of the Connecticut, and is surrounded by hills rising nearly 1000\r\nfeet in height, wooded to the summit, the chief of which is Mount\r\nHolyoke.\r\n\r\nMy impressions of this village, which must be attractive at all times,\r\nwere perhaps heightened by the circumstances under which it was viewed.\r\nA delightful day’s travelling had terminated at a comfortable hotel. The\r\nair was luxuriously balmy, and a cloudless sun, on the eve of setting,\r\nimparted a rich mellow tint to the face of nature, with which every\r\nperson of observation, leading a country life, must be familiar, and\r\nhave experienced how decorative it is to vegetation, and soothingly\r\ngratifying to human feelings. The houses, decked in white and green\r\ncolours, which harmonize in rural scenery, and are associated with\r\npurity and shade, so desirable during an American summer, were in\r\nkeeping with the landscape. In seeking for a comparison to Northampton,\r\nmemory suggested the village of Dirleton, near to my native place in\r\nScotland. But Dirleton, although associated with some of my best\r\ncherished recollections, and containing a picturesque ruin shrouded in\r\nivy, and adorned with shrubbery of unrivalled sweetness, yielded to\r\nNorthampton in situation, buildings, and vegetable beauty.\r\n\r\nHaving carried Mr Stuart’s work, “Three Years’ Residence in America,”\r\nwith us, as a kind of guide-book, for which it is recommended in the\r\nauthor’s preface, we experienced considerable disappointment at being\r\nunable to corroborate his description of Northampton. Instead of finding\r\nthat “much of the pavement and steps are of white marble,” we could only\r\nobserve a small portion which consisted of red brick. I shall not,\r\nhowever, take upon me to say there is no white marble pavement or steps\r\nin the village, but three of us walked about for an hour and a half\r\nwithout discovering a single stone of white marble; we did not, of\r\ncourse, approach villas remotely situated from the public roads, with a\r\nview of gratifying our curiosity, but every street, lane, and walk which\r\npromised gratification, were explored. His allusions to the vegetable\r\nbeauties are also unhappy, when he says, “if a traveller in Britain were\r\nto stumble on such a place as this, he would not fail to enquire whose\r\ngreat estate was in the neighbourhood, and attribute the decorations of\r\nshrubs, flowers, &c., which adorn even the smallest habitations here, to\r\nthe taste of a wealthy neighbour, or his being obliged to make them to\r\npromote electioneering views.” In the streets of Northampton, we\r\nnumbered three or four bushes of lilac and white pipe, and a few roses,\r\nas the amount of shrubs adorning the foreground of houses, and flowers\r\nof small size were equally rare. The spaces were generally unmown grass,\r\nand in several instances luxuriant thistles and docks excluded light\r\nfrom the apartments. At the back part of the hotel in which we lodged,\r\nthere was a garden, surrounded with a low ugly wooden fence, and crowded\r\nwith the gaudiest of flowers, but our general impression was, that the\r\ngardens are ill kept, void of beauty, and unworthy of the place. I would\r\nrequire no better illustration of the small progress the inhabitants of\r\nthe United States have made in gardening than Northampton, where man\r\nhath long resided, and done so little to improve the exquisite beauties\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nWe left Northampton at three o’clock next morning, and passed the bridge\r\nand valley of Connecticut before daybreak, breakfasting at Balchertown,\r\nand passing through Ware and Brookfield to Worcester, where we dined,\r\nand reached Boston Tremont hotel in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe stage passengers, in course of the day, were intelligent,\r\ncommunicative, and agreeable companions, polite during meals, and\r\nfrequently asking others to partake of the dishes they distributed. A\r\ngentleman asked me if the old mode of courting in Scotland was still\r\npractised—when, after the consent of the lady’s parents had been\r\nobtained, she was mounted on horseback, and her suitor placed in a\r\nsimilar situation, and if he could not overtake the fair one, it was\r\nconsidered a refusal. I laughed heartily, and assured him it was the\r\nfirst time I had heard of such a custom existing in my country, which,\r\nin all probability, never existed there, and could not now, as most of\r\nthe youth of both sexes were denied the luxury of riding, by a heavy tax\r\non saddle-horses. He rejoined, with an air of astonishment—“What! horses\r\ntaxed! Does any thing escape government? Would a man having a nose\r\nlonger than his companion’s be taxed for it?” I answered, “if he filled\r\nit with snuff—a practice very common amongst my countrymen—he would be\r\ntaxed.”\r\n\r\nThe villages through which we passed presented the same characters—white\r\nwooden houses with green Venetian blinds, and every thing wearing the\r\nappearance of cleanliness, order, and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe use of wood for fuel, the machinery of the manufacturing\r\nvillages—and all of them may be termed such—being propelled by water,\r\nand the absence of coal smoke, contribute, in no small degree, to the\r\nexternal cleanliness of the houses and garments of the inhabitants.\r\nManufacturing establishments were conspicuous in every direction, and\r\ninnumerable bundles of rye straw were bleaching around the cottages—the\r\nmanufacturing of straw hats to an immense extent being carried on in\r\nthis district.\r\n\r\nWe passed the workmen employed at the Boston and Worcester railway, at\r\npresent in progress, and which, it is said, will ultimately be extended\r\nto Albany. Agriculture furnishes little of interest, the soil is poor,\r\nand the crops partaking of its character—rye being the prevailing crop.\r\nSmall patches of Indian corn were observed, nearly destroyed by frost;\r\nand the pastures were inferior. In the neighbourhood of Worcester, many\r\nof the fences consist of stone walls. Within a few miles of Boston five\r\nor six men were engaged in throwing peats out of a bog, seemingly for\r\nthe purpose of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe horses observed on the roads were lean and inferior. Draught oxen\r\nseemed in good condition, and of large size. Many of the cows were\r\nfinely formed, of a deep red colour, with dark faces. Barberry, elder,\r\nand alder were growing plentifully in a state of nature. The\r\nrhododendron seemed to occupy the place of furze in Scotland—the kalmia\r\nthat of heath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Boston to Lowell—Lynn—Salem—Newburghport—Female waiters,\r\n    or helps—Agricultural notices—Stage passengers—Lowell—Manufacturing\r\n    females—American and British manufacturers—House building—Benevolent\r\n    Societies—Water power—Manufacturing power of Britain and the United\r\n    States—Notices of Nature._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had my eyes injured in travelling from Albany, I was unable to\r\nenjoy the sights of Boston—accomplishing only, with the aid of a shade,\r\nthe delivery of a letter at 50, North Market, where there is an\r\nextensive assortment of agricultural implements, meriting the notice of\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nNext day we left Boston for Newburghport, a distance of twenty-four\r\nmiles, travelling by way of Lynn and Salem, the latter containing about\r\n13,000 inhabitants, many of whom are extensively engaged in the Indian\r\ntrade, and the former containing 4000 souls, is celebrated for the\r\nmanufacture of ladies’ shoes.\r\n\r\nNewburghport is situated on the banks of the river Merrimack, three\r\nmiles from its mouth, over which there is a suspension bridge of six\r\narches, 350 yards in length. It possesses considerable trade, and\r\ncontains a population of about 7000 souls. In our progress through the\r\nNew England States, attendants at table, except in cities, were chiefly\r\nfemales, more especially during tea, which is invariably served out by\r\nthem. The female waiters at Newburghport were ladylike in manners and\r\nappearance, and politely opened the door on our retiring from meals. In\r\nevery case that came under our notice, their demeanour was\r\nprepossessing, and such as would command respect from gentlemen. Having\r\nbeen unaccustomed to such attendants, I felt disappointed at the manner\r\nin which their services were received at table—a polite or kind\r\nexpression never being addressed to them, and their assiduous attentions\r\nunacknowledged. In no instance did I observe a female attendant seat\r\nherself at table, nor even in the room with the guests of a hotel, and\r\nonly on one occasion, in a private house, a help of slender years\r\noccupied a seat in a dark corner of the room during tea, when her\r\nassistance was not required. I do not see why a help of low or high\r\ndegree should not seat herself when her services are not wanted. There\r\nare many anomalies in human customs. In Asiatic countries, the slave is\r\nrequired to bend himself almost in the dust, while in Britain the\r\nsuperior exacts homage in an erect posture.\r\n\r\nRemaining for the night at Newburghport, we hired a gig for the purpose\r\nof visiting a farm fourteen miles distant, belonging to a gentleman\r\nresiding at New York, to whom, for his polite and friendly attention, I\r\nam much indebted, and should feel pleasure in having an opportunity of\r\nexpressing my gratitude by deeds. We returned by Newburghport, in time\r\nfor dinner, after which we proceeded by stage to Lowell, along the banks\r\nof the Merrimack by Andover.\r\n\r\nThe country from Boston to Newburghport and the interior, which we\r\nvisited, is low and marshy, with a poor soil and inferior crops. The\r\npastures appeared in most cases suffering from want of drainage and\r\nprevious management. In the eastern States of America, and more\r\nespecially in those of New England, hay is the best paying article of\r\nfarm produce, which induces farmers to mow their grass lands when first\r\nsown down, year after year, so long as the herbage can be collected with\r\nthe scythe, after which it is converted into pasturage. Grass land so\r\ntreated cannot fail of yielding a poor return in pasturage in any\r\ncountry, and more especially in the States of New England, where there\r\nare few natural grasses, the soil poor, and where the husbandman does\r\nnot assist nature by a judicious supply of seeds. Many of the enclosures\r\nconsist of stone walls; and in one instance, near Boston, I observed an\r\nexcellent thorn hedge. On the farm which we visited, there was a good\r\nshort-horn bull, and a thrashing-machine. The wheat straw of the\r\npreceding year was sadly mildewed. In one instance I observed meadow\r\nfoxtail grass growing in a situation which induced me to think it was\r\nindigenous.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country along the banks of the Merrimack, after\r\nleaving Newburghport, is finely undulating, and several sweet lakes were\r\nseen. The soil, on passing Andover, was of the worst description of\r\nsand, bearing crops truly wretched. A few patches of hops were seen in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe stage from Newburghport to Lowell was crowded with well-dressed\r\nfemales, unembarrassed in manner, untainted with forwardness or\r\nvulgarity, and who evidently had not been accustomed to high life. On\r\nour arrival at Lowell, we observed several stages deposit loads of the\r\nsame sex, which circumstance was accounted for by the extensive\r\ncotton-manufactories situated in the immediate neighbourhood. There is a\r\nconstant succession of females departing from, and arriving at, Lowell;\r\nthe high wages of those attending the factories attract such as\r\nparticularly want a sum of money, after obtaining which they return\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nLowell is the chief seat of cotton manufactures in the United States;\r\nwas formerly a section of the town of Chelmsford, and derives its name\r\nfrom Francis Lowell, who introduced the manufacture of cotton into the\r\nStates. It is situated at the confluence of the rivers Merrimack and\r\nConcord, and has risen into manufacturing importance of late years. The\r\nsource of its riches and power is the water of the Merrimack, which is\r\nconducted to the town by a canal, one mile and a half in length, eight\r\nfeet deep, and sixty wide, distributed by lateral branches, and again\r\ndischarged, either into the Merrimack or Concord; the fall being\r\nthirty-two feet. Lowell communicates with Boston, from which it is\r\ndistant twenty-five miles, by a canal, and a railway is now forming.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures comprehend those of cotton, and woollen of various\r\nkinds, gunpowder, ale, &c. The chief manufacturing company is the\r\nMerrimack, which, in 1832, employed four hundred males and nine hundred\r\nfemales, with one thousand looms and twenty-six thousand spindles at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBy the census of Lowell for January, 1828, the total population was\r\n3532, of which 2190 were females. On 12th June, 1830, the population was\r\n6477, whereof 4085 were females. The following is the census on 1st\r\nJune, 1832—\r\n\r\n                   _White Males._  │ _White Females._\r\n                 10 (_under_)   703│10 (_under_)   771\r\n                 10 to 20       563│10 to 20     1,465\r\n                 20 to 30     1,996│20 to 30     2,735\r\n                 30 to 40       720│30 to 40       638\r\n                 40 to 50       208│40 to 50       238\r\n                 50 to 60        62│50 to 60        83\r\n                 Above 60        27│Above 60        52\r\n                         Grand Total, 10,254.\r\n\r\nThe females engaged in manufacturing amount to nearly 5000, and as we\r\narrived at Lowell on the afternoon of Saturday, we had an opportunity of\r\nseeing those connected with some of the largest cotton factories\r\nretiring from labour. All were clean, neat, and fashionably attired,\r\nwith reticules hanging on their arms, and calashes on their heads. They\r\ncommonly walked arm in arm without displaying levity. Their general\r\nappearance and deportment was such that few British gentlemen, in the\r\nmiddle ranks of life, need have been ashamed of leading any one of them\r\nto a tea-party. Next day, being Sunday, we saw the young females\r\nbelonging to the factories going to church in their best attire, when\r\nthe favourable impressions of the preceding evening were not effaced.\r\nThey lodge, generally, in boarding-houses, and earn about 8s. 6d.\r\nsterling per week, independent of board; serving girls earn about 4s.\r\n3d.\r\n\r\nThe recent introduction of large manufacturing establishments, thin\r\npopulation, and ample reward of labour, account for the apparent comfort\r\nand propriety of the Lowell young women. The situation of the\r\nmanufacturing class in Britain is very different: nurtured amidst\r\npoverty and vice, they toil in crowded and unwholsome factories from\r\ninfancy, often disregarded by parents and employers, and attaining\r\nmaturity ruined in constitution and in morals, with few of the\r\nsympathies of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe factories and dwelling-houses at Lowell are mostly composed of\r\nbrick, although good building stone is to be had everywhere. The people\r\nseem to be influenced by habit in house-building at Lowell; a wooden\r\ndwelling-house was being erected where rock, which had been dug from the\r\ncellar, was obstructing its progress, and thousands of loads of stones\r\nquarried in forming a railway, were lying at not more than one hundred\r\nyards distant. Here I saw a stone arch building across a lateral branch\r\nof the canal, which was the only bridge of that material I saw—wood\r\ngenerally being used for their construction. Many large sized\r\ndwelling-houses and factories were in the progress of erection.\r\n\r\nLowell is connected with the village Belvedere by a bridge over the\r\nriver Concord, the water of which is also employed in propelling\r\nmachinery. In Lowell there are seven newspapers published, one of which\r\nis a daily paper. There are no less than forty religious and benevolent\r\nsocieties—a magnitude of number, owing, perhaps, to the many religious\r\nsects wishing to equal each other in good deeds. This village may be\r\ntaken as an instance of the giant strides by which the United States are\r\nadvancing to greatness, and the immeasurable water power nature has\r\nlavished on them. The canal supplies more water than the present\r\nmachinery requires; and, after inspecting the surplus in the canal and\r\nrivers, I am of opinion, there is water enough to propel nearly one\r\nhundred times the machinery at present employed, and which might employ\r\na population of above a hundred thousand souls.\r\n\r\nBritain is said to owe much of her greatness to the supply of coal with\r\nwhich she has been blessed; but however extensive and available it may\r\nbe, the water power of the United States will excel it in cheapness and\r\nmagnitude. The price of labour is, and will likely continue, much\r\ncheaper in Britain than in the United States, which seems the only\r\ncircumstance that can ultimately give a superiority to the manufactories\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry plant was met with in every direction throughout our\r\nexcursions, and the fruit was found to be of superior quality on very\r\npoor soil on the banks of the Concord. In one instance I removed a plant\r\nfrom the earth, the leaves of which did not cover three-fourths of an\r\ninch in diameter, bearing two ripe berries and one unripe. The\r\napple-trees from Boston to Lowell exhibited leafless trunks; and, on\r\ninspection, I found the cankerworm which was said to have destroyed them\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt Newburghport the noise of toads and land turtles, in the evenings,\r\nwas deafening. At Lowell we first became acquainted with the call of the\r\nbull-frog, which in loudness and expression strongly resembles the note\r\nof the English bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Lowell to Saratoga—Keene—Bellows\r\n    Falls—Townsend—Arlington—Driver at Table—Landlord and Driver—Passage\r\n    of the Green Mountains—Stage Coach practices of America and\r\n    Britain—Passengers and Travellers—Juvenile Politeness—Agricultural\r\n    Notices—New England Villages—Free School Education unfairly\r\n    estimated by British travellers—Education of Scotland and the United\r\n    States—Public Schools—Fagging in the Seminaries of\r\n    Britain—Principles of Education._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Lowell on the morning of the 2d June, passing through Gorton,\r\nTownsend, New Ipswich, Jeffrey, and Keene, a pretty little town with a\r\nneat square, in which there is a church with a handsome spire, and many\r\nof the houses are composed of brick. The situation is an extensive plain\r\nsurrounded by well-wooded hills, but the beauty of the place is injured\r\nby the want of trees and grass in front of the houses in the square. The\r\npopulation amounts to about 2500 souls. There are two glass\r\nmanufactories—two for cotton, and one for woollen are about to be\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nBellows Falls are romantically situated on the river Connecticut, the\r\napproach passing round the base of a beautiful mountain, and over a\r\nbridge across the rapids of the river. The manufacture is paper, the\r\nmachinery propelled by water obtained from a canal half a mile in\r\nlength, and there is a vast unemployed power.\r\n\r\nTownsend is a small village lying in the bosom of a sweet amphitheatre\r\nof hills of limited extent. Its general effect is somewhat destroyed by\r\na glaring church spire, the basement of which is painted white, the\r\nmiddle part pea-green, and the top a chocolate colour.\r\n\r\nArlington consists of a few houses; it has a stone church, finished with\r\nturrets of wood work, a combination of materials in the exterior of\r\nbuildings very common in the United States and the Canadas.\r\n\r\nAt New Ipswich, the driver of the stage seated himself at table with the\r\npassengers, which was the only instance of the kind that came under my\r\nobservation. Some of the passengers were of the most genteel\r\ndescription, and the driver conducted himself with propriety.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Bellows Falls, the landlord of the hotel saluted the\r\nstage driver with “How do you do, captain?” and he answered—“Quite well,\r\nmajor—this is a cold morning.” The major in question ushered us into the\r\nbreakfast room, where he presided with a suavity of manner that would\r\nhave done credit to a Frenchman; and I considered this individual the\r\nmost courteous I met with in the course of my tour. The hotel-keepers of\r\nthe country are the noblesse of the district, and are generally chosen,\r\nby the people, officers of the militia. Captain is a general title for\r\nstage drivers; and I found, both in the States and Upper Canada, that\r\nmilitary titles of high sounding were often used as nicknames. I did not\r\nenquire if our driver was actually a military captain, but so far as\r\nappearance entitles a man to rank, he might have been a field-marshal.\r\n\r\nThe road from Jeffrey to Arlington is through a poor hilly country,\r\nabounding in scenic beauty of infinite variety, which afforded me more\r\npleasure than the banks of the Hudson. From Bellows Falls to Arlington\r\nwe passed over what, in common parlance of the country, is termed a new\r\nbuilt turnpike, leading through the Green Mountains, which had been only\r\na few weeks open to travellers, and some parts of which were almost\r\nimpassable. Twenty miles of this road is through a dense forest, quite\r\nimpervious to the sun’s rays; and for five or six miles on the other\r\nside of the Green Mountains towards Arlington, in a deep narrow ravine,\r\nthe rocks and hills being finely wooded to the summit. The country opens\r\nup into picturesque views towards Sunderland, which is a few miles from\r\nArlington.\r\n\r\nPassing the night in a crowded hotel at Arlington, we proceeded next\r\nmorning to Saratoga, by Union Village and Schuyler-ville, where the\r\nstage stopped a little after twelve, to afford two passengers an\r\nopportunity of dining, who did not take breakfast at Arlington, although\r\nonly twelve miles distant from Saratoga, the end of our journey. This\r\naccommodating spirit of stage-coaches stopping whenever passengers\r\nchoose to feed, and calling for or setting them down at their respective\r\nresidences in towns, seems at variance with the character of the people,\r\nand is somewhat trying to the temper of a newly-imported traveller. In\r\nBritain travellers must wait for the coaches which arrive and depart\r\nfrom each place at specified hours, with perfect punctuality. In America\r\nthe coaches wait for the travellers, and the consequent irregularity is\r\nsuch, that if a coach is said to reach a given place by twelve, there is\r\nan equal chance whether it does so by twelve at noon or midnight.\r\n\r\nThe road from Arlington passes for many miles along the river\r\nBattenkill, the banks of which afford good sheep-pasturage, and some\r\nfine grain-growing districts were seen near Cambridge, before reaching\r\nUnion Village.\r\n\r\nFrom Schuyler-ville to Saratoga, the soil is of the quality of\r\ndrift-sand. A fence of considerable extent was observed on the wayside,\r\ncomposed of pine-tree roots adhering to the trunks, and placed close to\r\neach other, so as to form an effectual barrier against ordinary\r\nintruders. This was the most picturesque fence I ever beheld.\r\n\r\nThe stage passengers and other travellers we came in contact with\r\nthroughout our excursion in the states of New England, were chiefly\r\nmechanics, unobtrusive in manner, intelligent, and free from vulgarity.\r\nThey conversed on every subject connected with their own and other\r\ncountries, and betrayed none of that question-searching curiosity\r\nimputed to the population. They seemed to possess a general knowledge of\r\nBritish literature, and more especially of the works of Sir Walter Scott\r\nand Robert Burns. They are also familiar with the works of Captain Hall\r\nand Mrs. Trollope, and occasionally asked if I found the people of the\r\nStates as inquisitive as represented by those writers. The proceedings\r\nand success of Dr. Franklin were often quoted; and the life of that\r\ngreat man seems to have had no small share in stamping the character of\r\nthis class of the population.\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the houses after passing the Green Mountains\r\nbecame gradually less attractive, till at last they were little better\r\nthan mere log-houses.\r\n\r\nPrimary or State school-houses were frequently seen, and I regretted not\r\nhaving an opportunity of examining the proficiency of the pupils. The\r\nlittle boys attending the schools were often going without stockings or\r\nshoes, and the girls generally wore flowing trowsers to their ankles. On\r\none occasion, in passing through the state of Vermont, I observed four\r\nlittle girls and two boys going to school, dressed in clean clothes,\r\nwith nice little baskets over their arms, which I conjectured to contain\r\ntheir dinner. When the stage passed by them, the misses curtsied, and\r\nthe boys bowed to the passengers. I was much gratified at this voluntary\r\nand unexpected display of juvenile politeness, and repeatedly kissed my\r\nhand in return; but recollecting they might not understand such a mode\r\nof acknowledgment, I leant my head out at the coach window and bowed\r\nfamiliarly, when they seemed delighted at my interchange of civilities,\r\nand smiled to each other.\r\n\r\nA valued friend, residing in the neighbourhood of Montreal, informed me\r\nhe was visiting at Rochester, in the state of New York, in 1831, when a\r\nplain-dressed little girl approached the window of a cottage at which he\r\nwas seated, on a fine summer evening, and curtsying, asked him for a\r\nrose, a flower which was growing profusely round the cottage. He told\r\nher to help herself to the prettiest she could find, but being afraid of\r\ninjuring the bush, she returned, asked the use of his knife, which being\r\ngranted, she departed with the object of her affections.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the New England States is often hilly, always highly\r\nundulating, and the soil generally rocky, and of the most inferior\r\ndescription of sand. The staple crop appeared to be rye; and we did not\r\nobserve fifty acres of wheat throughout a journey of 400 miles. The\r\ngrass was scanty, and seemingly incapable of fattening oxen, from its\r\ninferior quality. The cattle, as already stated, were of a good breed,\r\nbut often remarkably lean. Sheep were inferior, and so also were horses\r\nused for farming purposes. The mode of farming did not meet my\r\napprobation; but perhaps bad land, like bad wives, can be managed by\r\nevery one but by those who possess them; and a foreigner unacquainted\r\nwith the peculiarities of the district cannot be an infallible judge of\r\nsuch matters. It appears to me, however, impossible that the New England\r\nStates can furnish food sufficient for the population; and the time is\r\nperhaps near at hand when the whole produce will not do more than\r\nmaintain the agriculturists, and supply the manufacturers with dairy\r\nproduce, leaving their butcher-meat and bread to come from other\r\ndistricts. The present farmers find difficulty in earning a subsistence,\r\nand any thing paid in the name of rent must be truly insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe villages of New England are uniformly clean, airy, and neat, with\r\nspacious openings near the centre, in which churches form the most\r\nprominent feature. Indeed, a village is seldom seen without having two\r\nor three churches of considerable size, composed of wood, painted white,\r\nand surmounted with a spire, and generally flanked with a considerable\r\nextent of shades for waggons and horses belonging to people coming from\r\na distance. The houses are, in some instances, built of brick, but more\r\nfrequently of wood, painted white, with green Venetian blinds, opening\r\nto the outside. Both churches and dwelling-houses seem to be painted\r\nannually; at least, they are never seen in the slightest degree dingy\r\ncoloured. The houses of every size and fabric, have a light appearance\r\nfrom the number of windows they contain, the legislature not taxing the\r\ninhabitants for enjoying air and light through the medium of windows as\r\nin Britain. The houses seldom indicate either extensive wealth or\r\npoverty of the inmates; and although the architectural decorations are\r\noften in bad taste, and the materials of which they consist associated\r\nin the mind of the Europeans with instability, yet the general effect is\r\nhighly pleasing, and the villages want only the judicious aid of flowers\r\nand shrubs to render them absolutely beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe system of Free-school education in the Eastern States does not\r\nappear to have been fairly estimated by some British travellers. Mr.\r\nStuart, in chapter xiv. of “Three Years’ Residence in America,” states,\r\n“the general plan of education at the public Free-schools, is not\r\nconfined to merely reading, writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping, and\r\nthe ancient and modern languages, but comprehends grammar, mathematics,\r\nnavigation, geography, history, logic, political economy, and rhetoric;\r\nmoral and natural philosophy; their schools being, as stated in the\r\nprinted regulations, intended to occupy the young people from the age of\r\nfour to seventeen;” and in chapter xvi. he takes the same view when\r\nconversing with President Jackson. Captain Basil Hall and Mr. Hamilton\r\nseem to consider them charity-schools, and consequently objectionable to\r\nan independent people.\r\n\r\nThe public Free-schools, or what are called “common schools,” and\r\nmaintained by public funds, are managed in each district by twelve\r\ndirectors, chosen by the people, at which children are taught gratis,\r\nthe parents furnishing books. The funds being inadequate to provide\r\nteachers during the whole year, men are engaged to teach in winter, and\r\nwomen, who are engaged at a cheaper rate, to teach during the summer.\r\nThe period of teaching varies according to the extent of funds, which\r\nare managed with economy, and seldom exceeds nine months throughout the\r\nyear, and in some States only six months. In one or two States, there is\r\nalso a Free grammar-school in each county town.\r\n\r\nIt has been formerly stated, that an opportunity of examining the common\r\nschools of New England did not occur. I, however, saw the scholars of\r\nupwards of twenty of them in the school-houses, and on the play-ground.\r\nI also saw several of the teachers. None of the scholars, who, in\r\nsummer, are chiefly girls, seemed above twelve years of age, and the\r\nteachers were invariably females. From this circumstance, it appeared to\r\nme that Mr. Stuart had confounded the district common schools with the\r\ngrammar-schools of the county towns; and many of the natives, to whom I\r\nshowed his account of the schools, readily agreed in this view. Indeed,\r\nto state that little children and female teachers in the woods of\r\nAmerica should be engaged in logic, rhetoric, and navigation, is taxing\r\ncredulity too far.\r\n\r\nThe funds, remunerating teachers of common schools, being provided by\r\nthe State, _for general use_, not only removes from the inhabitants any\r\nfeeling of degradation or dependence, in the education of their\r\nchildren, but renders it their duty to prefer such seminaries, when the\r\nteachers are equally good. It is singular that Captain Hall and Mr\r\nHamilton, both Scotsmen, should consider these schools eleemosynary and\r\ndegrading, when the religious establishment, as well as the schools of\r\ntheir own country, are similarly situated. The inhabitants of Britain do\r\nnot consider themselves partaking of charity when listening to teachers\r\nof religion, or preachers in connexion with establishments, nor when\r\neducating their children at public seminaries, the teachers of which are\r\nalmost always in part remunerated by public funds, and the fees\r\nconsequently lower than they would otherwise be. In private tuition the\r\nteacher has, in most cases, received his education in part from public\r\nfunds, and, in consequence, is a cheap source of instruction. The\r\nprinciple of public education in Scotland and the United States is the\r\nsame, and if at all eleemosynary, the degree is less in the American\r\nStates, where the inhabitants generally have a voice in levying and\r\ndisposing of the funds. The Scotch system of schools is, however,\r\npreferable, by guarding against a change of teachers, frequently\r\ninjurious to the progress of those under tuition—the appointment of\r\nparochial teachers being for life, or during good behaviour; and each\r\nsession continuing throughout the year, with the exception of two or\r\nthree weeks’ vacation. The schools are not like those in the States,\r\nfree; but in consequence of the teachers having a fixed salary, the fees\r\nmay be said to be half-price, which operates on the diligence of the\r\nteachers, and is a considerable boon to the inhabitants. In some of the\r\nStates, where common schools are open half the year, the expense to\r\nparents is nearly the same as in Scotland, where the parochial school is\r\nopen throughout the year at half-price, without, however, the pupils\r\nhaving a chance of making the same progress.\r\n\r\nPublic schools are founded on the principle of diffusing knowledge\r\namongst the people, thereby raising the standard of morality—by which\r\ncrime is prevented, and good government secured. Simple, and in some\r\nrespects defective, as the American common school system is, it has,\r\nnevertheless, succeeded well, and seems suited to the present wants of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nReading and writing, with the elements of arithmetic, which can be\r\nattained in a few years, enable those to improve themselves by\r\napplication who are at all desirous of acquiring knowledge. Indeed, the\r\nlearning generally obtained at school may be regarded as but a\r\nfoundation to build on in after life; and therefore the schools of the\r\nUnited States and Scotland supply, alike, the primary means of ultimate\r\nimprovement. A longer and severer course of mental study than afforded\r\nby these institutions often converts weak minds into polished nothings,\r\nwithout adding to the usefulness of the man.\r\n\r\nThe system of fagging, so generally introduced into the higher\r\nseminaries of England, and which may be described as each of the senior\r\nmembers holding a junior in slavery, requiring not only the discharge of\r\nmenial services, such as brushing clothes, and cleaning shoes, but often\r\nthe performance of criminal and immoral actions, is altogether unknown\r\nin the States. Fagging is so complete and systematic in many of the\r\nEnglish schools, that the junior boys have not the power of resisting\r\nthe commands of their seniors, and must lie or steal at their nod. Such\r\na system inculcates passive obedience in the weak, and absolute power in\r\nthe strong; the ductile youth, after being corrupted by vice, and\r\ndegraded by offices of slavery, becomes, in turn, slave-master, when\r\nrecollections of his former sufferings leads him to exercise his power\r\nwith more zeal, and when so trained, he is sent forth to play his part\r\nin the world. Powerful minds occasionally overcome the effects of this\r\npernicious education, but ordinary ones are unable to do so. It is\r\nchiefly the aristocracy of Britain who are reared under the fagging\r\nsystem, and it unfortunately too often influences their conduct in after\r\nlife. A law prohibiting fagging in seminaries of youth would be a\r\nblessing to Britain, where man too often fags his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nFagging has found an eloquent advocate in Mr. Hamilton, in his work\r\nentitled “Men and Manners in America,” wherein he seems to consider its\r\nmenial duties as tending to overcome pride of birth and station. But\r\neven in this narrow view fagging must be condemned, as the menial\r\noffices are forcibly imposed, and flow not from philanthropy of feeling\r\nor legitimate authority, but from usurped and overpowering tyranny.\r\nMenial offices in the seminaries of England are the means of corrupting,\r\nnot of improving youth, and fagging fosters the worst of human vices. If\r\npride of birth and station is to be corrected, public schools where\r\nfagging is unknown, and where all the pupils are placed on an equality,\r\nwill best attain the object.\r\n\r\nMr Hamilton treats of fagging as if it were general in England, whereas\r\nit exists only in the higher description of schools, and is, I believe,\r\naltogether unpractised in Scotland. When lately discussing this point, a\r\nfriend stated that fagging existed at the academy of Dollar in Scotland;\r\nand on applying to my brother Charles, who was educated at that\r\nseminary, if such was the case, I learned that he himself was the only\r\ninstance of an attempt of the kind, a big fellow having claimed such a\r\nprivilege on his first arrival, and which was frustrated by Willie M——\r\nand he joining and beating the tyrant well. Very few Scotch boys would\r\nfeel inclined to fag their companions, and still fewer to submit to such\r\na bondage.\r\n\r\nThe education of youth ought to embrace all that is necessary for\r\ndischarging the duties of life, and is most effectual when combining\r\nindustrious and moral habits with the highest degree of mental\r\ncultivation—on such a principle some of the schools of continental\r\nEurope are founded, and it is also acted on in one or two instances in\r\nthe State of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  _Company at Saratoga—Fast Eating—Notices of Buel Farm—Mr Buel—New\r\n    York—State Agricultural Society—Advantages of a young\r\n    country—Farmers of Britain and the States—British Agricultural\r\n    Societies._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached Saratoga, the most celebrated watering-place in America,\r\nabout two o’clock, and found accommodation at Congress Hall, the\r\nprincipal hotel in the village, and capable of accommodating 300\r\nindividuals. On retiring to prepare for dinner, my friend and I debated\r\nthe nature of the attire in which we should appear—he conceiving it\r\nunnecessary to change our travelling garb, and I thinking it proper to\r\nassume full dress, in expectation of meeting the gay, wealthy, and\r\npolished of the land. We soon found ourselves seated at a second dinner\r\ntable, consisting of a numerous company, which the railway coaches had\r\njust brought from Albany. The party displayed few symptoms of\r\nrefinement. A gentleman on the opposite side of the table deliberately\r\nfolded up the sleeves of his coat before commencing dinner, planted both\r\nelbows on the table, and swallowed his food voraciously, without once\r\nlooking to the right or left. I felt, and perhaps looked, disappointed\r\nat the hurried manner in which the party dined; and on the company\r\nleaving table immediately afterwards, my friend enjoyed his triumph of\r\nopinion, and quizzed my shoes and stockings, as a marked singularity\r\nwhich both of us were anxious to avoid. Tea was served at seven o’clock,\r\nand, as usual, the repast was a regular feeding race. Business may have\r\noriginated, but it cannot always excuse the practice of fast eating; and\r\nthe inmates of Congress Hall were in perfect idleness.\r\n\r\nIn the industrious and lower ranks of life I observed slower\r\nmastication, and greater politeness and attention to each other at table\r\nthan what is generally met with at fashionable hotels. The former\r\nfrequent boarding-houses, not very plentifully supplied with waiters, or\r\nfemale helps, and they consequently assist each other in carving, and\r\nother duties of the table, while they have fixed hours of relaxation\r\nfrom business, affording ample time for eating, whereas commercial men,\r\nand other people who are not laboriously employed, eat at table with\r\nnumerous attendants, and at short intervals snatched from business.\r\nTherefore, the traveller in America who draws an inference from what he\r\nwitnesses at the public tables of hotels, unfavourable to the manners of\r\nthe lower ranks of the inhabitants, does them injustice.\r\n\r\nAt Saratoga we tasted the different mineral waters, so deservedly\r\ncelebrated, and next morning travelled to Albany by the railway. The\r\nsoil over which we passed was unproductive sand, with exception of the\r\nbanks of the Mohawk, in the vicinity of Schenectady. Betwixt Schenectady\r\nand Albany, the plains of the railway exhibited sand of fifty feet deep,\r\nhaving a thick covering of small pine-trees.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in finding Mr. Buel at home, so well known as a farmer\r\nthroughout the Union. I walked over this gentleman’s grounds on my first\r\nvisit to Albany, and enjoyed the same privilege a third time in October.\r\nThe surface is highly undulating, the soil inferior sand, and extremely\r\nwet, though capable of being drained. Notwithstanding these\r\ndisadvantages, some good crops were seen, more especially Indian corn\r\nand Swede turnip, the latter having been sown after a hay crop, with\r\nbone manure, manufactured by Mr Buel himself; and the state of the farm\r\nis, perhaps, one of the most striking instances in America of man\r\novercoming the sterilities of nature.\r\n\r\nSome attempts had been made at enclosing with hedges, consisting of\r\nAmerican and British thorn, as well as locust. The hedges were not of\r\nsufficient age to enable me to judge of the fitness of the\r\nlast-mentioned plant for farm purposes; but I certainly did not augur\r\nfavourably of it, from the specimen before me. The American thorn was\r\npreferred by Mr Buel to the British; and, perhaps, indigenous plants\r\nwill generally be found superior to foreign ones. In the present\r\ninstance, however, the soil was not such as I have found congenial to\r\nthe British thorn, and the management of the fences had not been\r\nunexceptionable. A few days afterwards I had a proof of the growing\r\npowers of British thorn at Geneva, where I cut a growth of the season on\r\nthe 24th. of June, from the hedge of Mr W——’s garden, three feet in\r\nlength. This, joined to the fine hedge of Mr F—— of the same place,\r\nestablishes the fitness of the British thorn for the climate of America.\r\nThe American thorn has very broad leaves, large fruit containing several\r\nseeds; and when growing in single trees, has horizontal branches, few\r\nprickles, and is apparently more dwarfish than the British species,\r\nwhich possesses pendulous branches, with numerous prickles. The British\r\nthorn has the property of growing throughout spring, summer, and autumn,\r\nwhich, with its numerous and strong prickles, eminently fits it for a\r\nfence plant.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr Buel’s farm is much celebrated, it presents few attractions\r\nto any one conversant with British agriculture. He is himself, however,\r\nan object of interest to the farmer of any country who has studied his\r\nprofession. His conversation on a variety of subjects amply unfolded to\r\nme the treasures of an enlarged and well-stored mind, and I was\r\ndelighted to find his views of improving agriculture harmonize with what\r\nI had long advocated in my humble sphere. At separation he presented me\r\nwith the printed proceedings of the New York State Agricultural Society,\r\nof a considerable portion of which he is the author; and I imagine a day\r\nspent with Mr. Buel one of the richest agricultural treats that can be\r\nenjoyed in North America.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Agricultural Society was incorporated by act of the\r\nLegislature, on 26th April, 1832. A Report, recommending a Legislative\r\ngrant, was approved, at a general meeting of the Society, in February,\r\n1833, and in all probability the grant has been obtained before this\r\ntime. I extract the Report, as conveying, in the general remarks, with a\r\nfew exceptions, my own sentiments.\r\n\r\n“_Report of the Select Committee on the Memorial of the New York State\r\nAgricultural Society._\r\n\r\n“Mr Sudam, from the select committee to which was referred the memorial\r\nof the New York State Agricultural Society, praying for the\r\nestablishment of an Agricultural School,\r\n\r\n“Reported:—That they have had under their consideration the subject\r\nsubmitted to them, accompanied by a report made, during the present\r\nsession, to the New York Agricultural Society, and on which their\r\nmemorial to the Legislature is predicated.\r\n\r\n“It will be conceded that there is no portion of the community more\r\nentitled to the fostering care of the Legislature, than the tillers of\r\nthe soil. The farmers of the State of New York are a class numerous,\r\nwealthy, industrious, patriotic, and above all other classes, from\r\nprinciple, devoted to our republican institutions, and cherishing with a\r\nholy spirit the union of our States. Their political exertions are not\r\ncalled forth by a desire of any great portion of their own body for\r\nlegislative honours, or for those of the minor judicial situations in\r\nthe State; but to maintain and preserve inviolate that sacred trust\r\nwhich has descended to them by the revolutionary efforts of their\r\nfathers, the full protection of life, liberty, and property.\r\n\r\n“When a storm arises in the horizon, and danger awaits us from abroad,\r\nor when crazed ambition at home drives the frenzied passions of men to\r\nmadness and all its excesses, it is in the farming interest of the\r\ncountry that you find the steady hand which holds the balance of\r\npolitical power, and by its strong arm repels the foe, or by its\r\nelectoral voice annihilates the unjust hopes of the aspiring ambition of\r\nprofligate politicians.\r\n\r\n“It may be said by your committee, (without the imputation of a State\r\nvanity,) that New York holds a high rank by her munificent endowments of\r\ncolleges, academies, and common schools. We, knowing their extent, need\r\nnot elaborate on them in this report. Still it is but just to say, that\r\nshe is already cited in Europe as a signal instance of what may be done\r\nfor the education of every class of society, under the soft and benign\r\ninfluence of a free government, and that her motto is, ‘Knowledge is\r\nwealth.’\r\n\r\n“In her enterprise, by facilitating intercourse between the different\r\nsections of her State and the waters of the Atlantic, she is as\r\nunrivalled in conception as she has been successful in execution. Not\r\ncontent with this, it is an admitted fact, and worthy of all honour,\r\nthat she has carried into effect the most perfect prison discipline in\r\nthe world; and we have already witnessed the wise and the humane of\r\nEurope resorting to her shores to ascertain the art of subduing the\r\nrebellious passions of the worst of our race, without the aid of those\r\nsanguinary punishments which have so long disgraced the Old World.\r\n\r\n“Thus she has expended millions of her money, and already has she\r\nerected a monument to the wisdom of her statesmen, more durable than any\r\never dedicated to the victor of a thousand fields.\r\n\r\n“Who are they who have contributed so freely, so generously to\r\nexpenditures calculated to immortalize the State, and to establish its\r\nglory on so pure a foundation? Mainly the farmers of your country, the\r\nyeomen of the land, the tillers of the soil. Freely have they given, and\r\njoyfully have they paid, and most rich results have been the consequence\r\nof their enlightened liberality.\r\n\r\n“Is it then unfair to ask, what has been done by the legislature for a\r\nclass of its citizens so numerous, virtuous, and meritorious? The\r\nstranger, when he sojourns in our land, and views all that has been done\r\nfor the cause of science, for education in the higher branches of\r\nliterature, for your common schools, for the reformation and punishment\r\nof crimes on a scale superior to any State in Europe, naturally\r\nenquires: Show me your agricultural school. You are essentially an\r\nagricultural people; a class of society who have aided so liberally to\r\nthe institutions of your State, must have received the constant and\r\npeculiar care of legislative protection and patronage, by forming their\r\nminds, their habits and their tempers to become the patrons of the noble\r\nmonuments already erected, and which, while they shed lustre on our\r\nState, have placed her first among her sisters in the Union.\r\n\r\n“Shall we any longer be compelled to answer? We have no such\r\ninstitution; we have provided an ample revenue for all but a complete\r\ncourse of _practical_ instruction in agriculture. In almost every State\r\nin Europe, the attention of despotic governments has been called—nay,\r\nseriously and sedulously directed to the formation and endowment of\r\nschools of this description. There it is admitted the motive to a\r\ncertain extent may be mercenary—to provide _food_ for taxation. Here it\r\nis a _debt due from the State_ to a class which, before they _asked for\r\nthemselves_, have _contributed to all others_.\r\n\r\n“It is conceded by your committee, that to a certain extent farmers are\r\nnot fond of innovations. If experiments are tried, they are too often\r\nlimited to one or two. If they fail, it is condemned. That prejudices of\r\nthis description are fast wearing away, we admit; but that they still\r\nexist, to a considerable extent, there can be no doubt. And a _gentleman\r\nfarmer_ is generally at hand, as an instance of a poor farmer. But it is\r\nnot the intention of the committee to endow an institution to rear up\r\nand educate persons in the mere theory of husbandry. It is to combine\r\npractice with science; and if it should be said that this would be a\r\nschool only for the children of the more opulent, the unanswerable\r\nargument is, that it is the same in regard to your colleges, and must be\r\nso of necessity. Still the results of such an education, practised upon\r\nin all parts of the State, must and will lead to the most beneficial\r\nresults. A good example is worth a world of mere speculation.\r\n\r\n“In a school of this kind, under competent managers, there may be\r\nconcentrated the best models of practice, in rural labour, known at home\r\nor abroad. The various breeds of domestic animals, the varieties of\r\ngarden and orchard fruit, and the implements of husbandry, may be here\r\nsatisfactorily compared, and their relative merits and advantages\r\ndetermined. Diversified experiments may be made in the various\r\ndepartments of husbandry, calculated to instruct and improve us in\r\npractice. Mechanical science, particularly what is denominated _The\r\nMechanics of Agriculture_, may be illustrated and taught in the best\r\nmanner, in the shops, and on the farm. The application of science to the\r\nmechanic and manufacturing arts, has, in a wonderful degree, simplified\r\ntheir manipulations, abridged their labour, and rendered their results\r\nmore certain. From what has already been done, we are not permitted to\r\nhesitate or doubt but science will prove equally beneficial to\r\nagriculture. There is no business which embraces a wider range in\r\nnatural science than this.\r\n\r\n“The laws which govern organic and inorganic matter, which influence the\r\neconomy of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, it cannot be denied, have\r\na controlling influence in the operations of the soil, and in the\r\nbusiness of raising animals and plants. Education (practical education)\r\nis nowhere calculated to diffuse a more benign influence in society,\r\nthan when bestowed on the farmer. He neither claims nor can exercise a\r\nmonopoly. _His_ improvements and _his_ knowledge diffuse light around\r\nhim, and are beneficial to all within the sphere of their influence.\r\n\r\n“Your committee feel assured, that if put into operation, this school\r\nwill become, not only popular, but highly useful. To the pupil it will\r\nafford the most important advantages, besides instruction in the\r\nprinciples and practice of rural labour, which, of itself, confers the\r\npower of creating wealth. It will afford him the advantages of a\r\n_literary school_, qualify him for the higher duties of civil life, and\r\ngive him withal, what is seldom acquired but in youth, habits of labour\r\nand application to business; calculated alike to promote his individual\r\nhappiness, and the good of the State.\r\n\r\n“With such an education, combining personal labour for a practical\r\nknowledge of all the instruments of husbandry, and the mode and manner\r\nin which it is to be prosecuted, those scientific pursuits will be\r\nprosecuted with a certainty that the foot of labour is guided by the\r\nunerring results of experience, founded in and regulated by the laws of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n“This school is intended to be purely agricultural. But in saying this,\r\nit will be necessary to open a course of instruction, combined with\r\nlabour, which your committee venture to say, will be as interesting, and\r\nto the State, as valuable, as that which may be acquired in any other\r\nseminary. The different qualities of soil, as fitted for the various\r\nproducts of the earth; the use of compost and manures, as applicable to\r\nsoils: the seasons for planting the rotation of crops, and the vast mass\r\nof practical information which enables man to transform a wilderness\r\ninto a paradise, is worthy the pursuit of the _richest_ as well as the\r\nhumblest of the land.\r\n\r\n“Again, the importance of procuring, at all times and at fair prices,\r\nprime stock, of the best breeds of cattle, ought not to be omitted,\r\neither as an inducement to the Legislature, or as of the first\r\nimportance to the people.\r\n\r\n“The question is, shall we endow a school, to which many would desire to\r\nsend their children for the purpose of preparing them to depend in\r\nfuture life on one of the most certain, and therefore the most happy of\r\nhuman pursuits; combining in itself all the elements of constant,\r\nregular, and sagacious employment; and freed from the cares and\r\ncorroding recollections, present or past, of the pursuits of a political\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n“It is evident that law, divinity, and physic, are overstocked. The\r\npursuits of commerce are laborious, and do not very often yield a return\r\nto persons of a moderate fortune and liberal education: as now educated,\r\nthey are not fitted for farmers; so tenaciously do those early habits\r\nadhere to them, that the attempt at agriculture is generally a failure.\r\nYour committee propose to give them a school, to which resort may be had\r\nfor the cultivation of the mind, and the improvement of the person:\r\nLaying the foundation for future toils and pleasures, (for toils in\r\nagriculture are pleasures, when conducted to a successful result,) for\r\nfuture health and happiness, and preparing them to rear up a race, fit\r\nto transmit to posterity the liberties we so highly cherish.\r\n\r\n“Your committee do not, in this report, enter into a detail of the\r\nexpenditure necessary for this school. That is so fully treated of in\r\nthe annexed report to the Agricultural Society, that they could only\r\nrepeat what is there stated. But they cannot close without remarking\r\nwhat must be obvious to all, how much skill and science may effect in\r\nagricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\n“Is there one of our body who has not seen, and remarked, the difference\r\nin adjoining farms, where _nature had made no difference_ in the soil?\r\nIt is this practical skill, this science, combined with labour, that\r\nthey desire, (most anxiously desire,) to bestow on a rising generation;\r\nand they deem it their duty, most earnestly, to press it on the\r\nconsideration of the Legislature, as called for by every consideration\r\ndue to the public welfare, to the true and lasting interests of the\r\nState; and as the last, but most substantial pillar in the varied\r\nedifice of her public institutions.\r\n\r\n“Impressed with this belief, and that the school recommended will, in\r\nmany ways, prove highly beneficial to the community, and persuaded that\r\nthe State will ultimately be fully indemnified for her advances, your\r\ncommittee have prepared a bill in conformity with the prayer of the\r\npetitioners, which they have directed their chairman to ask leave to\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\n“_Report of the State Agricultural Society, Albany, February 14th,\r\n1833._\r\n\r\n“The committee appointed at the first meeting of the Society, to report\r\na plan for an Agricultural School, with an estimate of the expense\r\nnecessary to establish and put the same into operation; together with\r\ntheir views of such an establishment, beg leave to submit the following\r\nreport:—\r\n\r\n“The main objects of the proposed school are, to impart to agriculture\r\nthe efficient aid of the sciences, and to furnish it with the best\r\nmodels of practice; to teach, simultaneously, in the period of youth\r\ndevoted to academic studies, the practical operations of husbandry, and\r\nsuch branches of useful knowledge as may tend to elevate its character\r\nand increase its products. The _plan_, therefore, should embrace,\r\n\r\n“1. A Farm, of sufficient extent to afford room for the diversified\r\noperations of tillage, cattle and sheep husbandry, and of orcharding and\r\ngardening—on a scale that will admit a fair comparison being made of\r\ncrops, of breeds of cattle and sheep, and of the varieties of hardy\r\nfruits; and sufficiently diversified in soil and surface as to admit of\r\nsatisfactory experiments:\r\n\r\n“2. A Farm House and Farm Buildings, which may serve as models of\r\nconvenience, taste and economy, and accommodate the head farmer and his\r\nassistants:\r\n\r\n“3. A School Building, for the accommodation of teachers and scholars:\r\n\r\n“4. A Library and Philosophical Apparatus:\r\n\r\n“5. Stock and Implements for the farm: and,\r\n\r\n“6. Shops for the construction of farm implements and machinery, for the\r\nuse of the farm, for the illustration of mechanical science, and to\r\nafford practical instructions to the pupils in mechanics.\r\n\r\n“These items of expense, which may be considered preliminary and\r\npermanent, together with the cost of the furniture required for the\r\nschool building, are estimated at $7,500.\r\n\r\n“1. The plan of education might embrace: practical instructions in the\r\nvarious operations and labours of the farm, the garden, the orchards,\r\nand the shops: and,\r\n\r\n“2. The study of the natural sciences generally, mathematics, mechanics,\r\nchemistry, and drawing, so far as these may conduce or become\r\nsubservient to agricultural improvement; together with such other\r\nbranches of knowledge as will qualify the students for the higher duties\r\nof civil life—such as will fit them to become independent electors,\r\ndiscreet jurors, faithful magistrates, and wise legislators.\r\n\r\n“As prerequisites to admission to the school, the pupils might be\r\nrequired to possess a good common school education, to be at least\r\nfourteen years of age, and of good moral character. Four years might\r\nconstitute a course of studies; and the internal regulations and police\r\nof the school might be conformed, in a measure, to those of our military\r\nacademy.\r\n\r\n“A department of the farm should be set apart for experiments in\r\nhusbandry, and the details and results of these experiments accurately\r\nregistered. The garden and the orchard should contain all the good hardy\r\nfruits, and specimens of all hardy plants, that may be useful on the\r\nfarm, in the arts, in commerce, or that are ornamental—in order that the\r\nrelative value of different species and varieties may be determined, and\r\ntheir mode of culture and process of curing taught to the pupils, and\r\nthe approved kinds furnished for public distribution.\r\n\r\n“To put the school into operation, there will be required—a principal,\r\nprofessors, and teachers—a steward and servants, for the school:\r\n\r\n“A manager, labourers, and assistants, for the farm:\r\n\r\n“Machinists and assistants for the shops: and,\r\n\r\n“A practical and scientific manager for the garden and orchard.\r\n\r\n“The number of officers and assistants which will be required, must\r\ndepend upon contingencies: and of course the committee do not pretend to\r\nstate with precision, in their estimate, the amount of their salaries\r\nand pay.\r\n\r\n“The proceeds of the school and the farm may be expected to increase for\r\nsome years, and will materially depend on the terms of tuition. The\r\ncommittee have assumed, as reasonable data, that the number of pupils\r\nwould average 200, and the average produce of the farm amount to $4,000\r\nper annum, for the first four years. Upon the assumed data, then, the\r\nestimate would exhibit the following result:—\r\n\r\n                        _Preliminary Expenses._\r\n\r\n  Farm of 400 acres, at $30,                          $12,000\r\n  Farm buildings,                                       6,000\r\n  School buildings,                                    25,000\r\n  Library and Apparatus,                                7,500\r\n  Stock and implements,                                 3,150\r\n  Shops and tools,                                      1,250\r\n  Furniture for school,                                 1,150\r\n  Incidental,                                           1,500\r\n                                                      ———————\r\n  Total preliminary expense,                                  $57,550\r\n\r\n                           _Annual Expense._\r\n\r\n  Salaries of officers and teachers of the school,     $5,100\r\n  do       manager and labourers on farm,               1,000\r\n  do       machinists,                                    600\r\n  do       gardener,                                      300\r\n  Expense of boarding 200 pupils, at $1,50 per  week,  14,400\r\n  Servants for the establishment,                       2,000\r\n                                                      ———————\r\n  Estimated annual expense,                                   $23,400\r\n                                                              ———————\r\n                                                              $80,950\r\n                                                              =======\r\n\r\n            _The Annual Receipts are computed as follows_:\r\n\r\n  Board and tuition of 200 pupils, at $150 per annum,         $30,000\r\n  Produce of farm,                                              4,000\r\n                                                              ———————\r\n                                                              $34,000\r\n                                                              =======\r\n\r\n“Thus the total expense of establishing the school, and of maintaining\r\nit the first year, is estimated at $80,950, and the income, after the\r\nfirst year, it is believed, will be amply sufficient to defray all\r\nexpenses. Yet to meet contingencies that may occur, and to make up for\r\nany deficiency in the estimate, the committee think that an\r\nappropriation of $100,000, the surplus to be invested for the benefit of\r\nthe institution, will ensure usefulness and permanency to the school,\r\nand prove amply sufficient to meet all its wants. This sum, if equalized\r\namong the population of the State, would operate as a tax of about _five\r\ncents_ to each inhabitant.\r\n\r\n“Your committee have thus complied with the requisitions of the society,\r\nin submitting the plan of an Agricultural School, and an estimate of the\r\nexpense necessary to establish and put the same into successful and\r\npermanent operation. It only remains for them to state their opinion of\r\nits utility.\r\n\r\n“The agriculture of a country affords the best criterion of its\r\nprosperity. Whether we compare kingdoms, states, counties, districts, or\r\nfarms; the condition of this branch of labour, which they severally\r\nexhibit, is a sure index, not only of the pecuniary, but of its moral\r\ncondition. It is no less an axiom founded in truth, that agriculture\r\nprospers or languishes, in proportion to the science and skill of the\r\nmen who manage its labours. It is not the natural fertility of the soil,\r\nso much as the intelligence and industry of those who till it, which\r\ngives to husbandry its interests and its rewards. The man who devotes\r\nthe energies of a highly cultivated mind, to the improvement of this\r\nprimitive and all-important branch of labour, is a public benefactor.\r\nCincinnatus did more to immortalize his name, and to command our\r\napplause, by his love of rural labours, than by his military exploits.\r\nWashington, amid all the honours that irradiated his brow, sought his\r\nhighest pleasures in the business and retirement of the farm. And it was\r\nthe first remark of our present chief magistrate, to the writer, after\r\nintroduction, that he would not forego the pleasures of the farm for all\r\nthe honours and emoluments that this nation could confer upon him.\r\nEducation enables man to appreciate the wonderful provisions which God\r\nhas made for his happiness in rural life, and imparts to him the ability\r\nof diffusing instruction and happiness to multitudes around him.\r\n\r\n“It should be the policy of government, therefore, which watches over\r\nthe interest of all, to infuse into the labours of husbandry, all the\r\nlights of science and knowledge—to take care to expand and elevate the\r\nminds of those who are to give it efficiency and character, and to call\r\nforth skill and industry by proffered rewards. With us these\r\nconsiderations possess peculiar force. Our population and business are\r\nemphatically agricultural, and every aid which is extended to this class\r\nbenefits, indirectly, every portion of the community. Agriculture\r\nconstitutes the fountains of the thousand rills, which, swelling and\r\ntraversing every part of the State, propel the spindle and the hammer of\r\nthe artisan and the manufacturer, and finally, by their union, make up\r\nthe mighty stream of commerce which unceasingly flows into the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n“That our agriculture is susceptible of improvement—that the products of\r\nits labours may be doubled, nay, quadrupled, must be apparent to those\r\nwho have compared our husbandry with that of some European countries, or\r\nwho have contrasted at home the well-cultivated district or farm with\r\nthose which are badly managed. How is the desired amelioration to be\r\neffected? How can a better husbandry be so well promoted, as by teaching\r\nit to our youth? By sowing our seed in the springtime of life? Prejudice\r\nnowhere retains a stronger hold than among farmers who have approached\r\nor passed the meridian of life. While some retain old practices, for\r\nwant of confidence in their knowledge to guide them in better ones,\r\nothers lack the first requisites to improvement—a consciousness that\r\ntheir system is not the most useful; while not a few are influenced, in\r\ntheir hostility to public means of improvement, by the desire to keep\r\nthings to their own level. If we would efficiently improve this great\r\nbranch of business, and elevate its character, as well as the character\r\nof those who are engaged in its operations, we must do what universal\r\nexperience has shown to be the only sure method. We must lay our\r\nfoundation in the rising generation—we must teach the _young_ idea how\r\nto shoot—we must instruct the head to help the hands. Our physical and\r\nmental powers are twin sisters; they lighten each other’s labour, and\r\nmutually impart a zest to each other’s enjoyments. And as it is becoming\r\ncommon to introduce manual labour into literary schools, it is courteous\r\nthat literature and science should requite the civility, by associating\r\nwith the inmates of schools of labour.\r\n\r\n“Agricultural schools, although of modern date, have nevertheless been\r\nestablished in most of the states of Europe, and their utility has been\r\nfully demonstrated. Who has not heard of the school of Fellenburgh, at\r\nHoffwyl, or of Von Thayer, at Moegelin—to which young men are sent from\r\nevery part of Europe, and even from America? In France and Prussia,\r\nagricultural schools have been founded and maintained by the\r\ngovernments. If they are found to be beneficial, and worthy of\r\ngovernmental support, in countries where power is vested in the few, how\r\nmuch more salutary must they prove here—where our institutions receive\r\nthe impress of their character from the many, and where the perpetuity\r\nof these institutions depends emphatically upon the intelligence and\r\nvirtue of the agricultural population. Despotism will never flourish in\r\nAmerican soil, but through the ignorance, and, we may say, consequent\r\ndepravity of its cultivators.\r\n\r\n“Your committee recall to recollection, with feelings of pride, the\r\nmunificent benefactions of the Legislature, to advance the literary\r\ncharacter of our State; and the fact, that comparatively nothing has\r\nbeen done, legislatively, to improve our agriculture, which employs\r\nfive-sixths of our population, can be ascribed to the fact, that nothing\r\nhas been asked for—nothing thought of. Our public colleges and\r\nacademies, for literary instruction, are numerous and respectable. They\r\nmeet our eye in almost every village. But where are our public schools\r\nof labour? Where is the head taught to help the hands, in the business\r\nwhich _creates_ wealth, and which is the grand source of individual and\r\nnational prosperity and happiness? Our literary and professional schools\r\nhave been reared up and sustained by the expenditure of more than two\r\nmillions of dollars from the public treasury, and they continue to share\r\nliberally of the public bounty. It will not, however, be denied, that\r\nthe benefits which they dispense are altogether partial,—that the rank\r\nand file of society, destined by heaven to become the conservators of\r\ncivil liberty, are virtually denied a participation in the science and\r\nknowledge,—in the means of improvement and of happiness which they are\r\ncalculated to dispense. Is it not a mandate of duty, then, as well as of\r\nexpediency, that the benefits of public instruction should be more\r\ngenerally dispensed?\r\n\r\n“We hazard not the fear of contradiction in assuming, that if a moiety\r\nof public moneys, which have been appropriated to literary schools, had\r\nbeen judiciously applied, in rendering science subservient to the arts,\r\nand in diffusing the higher branches among the labouring classes, the\r\npublic benefits from the appropriation would have been far greater than\r\nthey are at the present day. How many hundreds may now be pointed out,\r\nof liberal education, who are mere ciphers in society, for want of the\r\n_early habits of application and labour_, which it is the object of the\r\nproposed school to form and infix! And how many, for want of these\r\nhabits, have been prematurely lost to their friends, and to a purpose of\r\nusefulness for which man seems wisely to have been created—that of doing\r\ngood to his fellows.\r\n\r\n“From a full conviction that the interests of the State not only\r\nwarrant, but require, an appropriation of public moneys to this object,\r\nyour committee beg leave to recommend to the consideration of the\r\nSociety the following resolution:\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That a respectful memorial be presented to the Legislature,\r\nin behalf of this Society, and of the great interest which it\r\nrepresents, praying that suitable provision may be made by law, for\r\nestablishing a school of agriculture, on the plan recommended in the\r\npreceding report; and that the co-operation, in this application, of\r\nsocieties and individuals friendly to the object of the petition, be\r\nrespectfully solicited.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report is attributed to Mr Jesse Buel, and is a document creditable\r\nto its author and the society which adopted it. It advocates mental\r\ncultivation of farmers, as the best means of improving agriculture, and\r\nyouth as the seedtime of an abundant harvest of human knowledge.\r\nWhatever diversity of opinion may exist in rural matters, every\r\nindividual who has reflected on the subject, will admit the mind of the\r\nfarmer is the chief implement of husbandry on which the agricultural\r\nsystem depends, and by which its advancement can be best effected. Man\r\nis the principal animal connected with the farm, and the amelioration of\r\nhis mind more important than the improvement of brute formation. Mr Buel\r\nknows well the strength of prejudice existing amongst farmers, the\r\nresults of their isolated situation, and that youth is generally the\r\nonly season when new impressions can be made and acted on. In advanced\r\nagriculture, the mind will guide the hands as well as all farm\r\nmachinery, and science and art become blended together in the relation\r\nand loveliness of conjugal unity. Mental illumination of farmers is not\r\nmerely calculated to advance agriculture, but to enable them to see, in\r\ntheir professional pursuits, the means of serving their\r\nfellow-creatures, and the exhaustless bounty of God.\r\n\r\nNew York is justly considered the leading state of the Union, being\r\ncelebrated for prison discipline, extensive canaling, common schools,\r\nand if Mr Buel’s vigour is spared for a few years, it is also likely to\r\nbe distinguished for its agricultural institution.\r\n\r\nThe United States possess great advantages, from being new or young\r\ncountries, in which no class have exclusive privileges, and where the\r\nselfishness and prejudices of classes are seldom manifested. The\r\ninhabitants are a mixture of all nations, or the descendants of such, in\r\nwhich the fetters of old customs have been loosened perhaps by\r\ncollision, and, in measures of general utility, they can at once adopt\r\nthe wisdom of antiquity without its folly. Many of their public\r\ninstitutions are illustrative of this as well as Mr Buel’s report.\r\n\r\nHow different is Britain and Ireland from the state of New York, where\r\nthe “tillers of the soil” are regarded as the most patriotic class,\r\nholding the balance of political power, and alike ready in repelling\r\nfoes and restraining profligate politicians. In former ages the\r\ncultivators of British soil were considered mere vassals, and termed\r\nvillains. At present they are lightly esteemed by those who chiefly reap\r\nthe benefit of their exertions; and although this is the age when the\r\nschoolmaster is said to be abroad, judicious steps have not been taken\r\nto improve their condition.\r\n\r\nAgricultural societies are to be found in almost every county in\r\nBritain, but their proceedings seldom directly embrace the improvement\r\nof the moral condition of humanity. Indeed their proceedings have\r\nsometimes an opposite tendency, by seeking to maintain monopolies and\r\nduties on foreign produce, which cripple trade, curtail the field of\r\nindustry, and enhance the necessaries of life, from all of which\r\nwretchedness and vice flow. But the population actively engaged in\r\nagriculture are also little cared for, and their condition seems\r\ndeclining comparatively with other classes. Such institutions too much\r\noverlook youth and moral agency in improving agriculture, and spend much\r\nof their funds and time on minor objects.\r\n\r\nIn making these observations on the agricultural societies of Britain, I\r\nam aware of some exceptions. The Liverpool society is a good\r\ninstitution, and a manufacturing district is the situation where an\r\nefficient society might be expected in Britain, as furnishing members\r\nliberal in mind, and comparatively free from agricultural prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe Highland Society of Scotland is also a good institution; its ample\r\nfunds accomplishing much for the benefit of the country by giving\r\npremiums; but more advantage would result from their application in the\r\nimprovement of youth, and in cultivating an experimental farm something\r\nanalogous to what Mr Buel recommends. Edinburgh would form an excellent\r\nsituation for such, where there is already a University Professor of\r\nAgriculture. An experimental farm of sufficient size would furnish\r\nbetter results from systematic procedure and continued registration,\r\nthan the efforts of isolated individuals. With such an institution, sons\r\nof landed proprietors might be instructed in the science and art of\r\nfarming, and the management of property. Stock and seeds might be\r\nexperimented with and improved; and by the sale of them the institution\r\nwould support itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  _Journey to Geneva—Schenectady—Question Asking—Stage\r\n    Driver—Valley of Mohawk—Agricultural Duties— Utica—Attention\r\n    to Females—Marcellus—Skeneatiles—Cayuga Bridge—Dinner\r\n    Party—Dumfries-shire Farmer—Sheep Husbandry—Condition of\r\n    Animals—Farms—Geneva._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Albany in the morning, and breakfasted at Schenectady, which\r\ncontains about 5000 inhabitants, and from its situation on the Mohawk,\r\nthe union of the Erie Canal, and railway from Albany and Saratoga, it is\r\nlikely to rise in importance. From Schenectady we proceeded, by stage,\r\nalong the valley of the Mohawk, on the north side of the river, to\r\nUtica, where we arrived about two in the morning, the state of the roads\r\nbeing bad.\r\n\r\nThe temperature was unpleasantly warm throughout the day, and the stage\r\ncrowded with passengers, who were generally agreeable companions. One of\r\nthem, a gentleman in dress and manners, while conversing with my friend,\r\nenquired what country he came from, and immediately apologized for so\r\ndoing. It is but justice to the people of America to say, this was the\r\nfirst question put to either my friend or me evincing curiosity, and\r\nconsidering conversation had been previously continued for hours, it was\r\nnot altogether inexcusable. Travellers from a foreign land generally ply\r\nwith questions the natives they come in contact with, and thereby lay\r\nthemselves open to questions in return.\r\n\r\nThe driver who carried us to Utica behaved improperly towards my friend,\r\nregarding his luggage. He was a saucy fellow, and spouted what he\r\nperhaps considered wit, and others insolence, with every person who\r\nspoke to him. In fact, he was the only insolent driver I met with in the\r\nUnited States, this class of men being generally civil and accommodating\r\nto their passengers. He treated all travellers alike, and when told by\r\nan American he had taken four hours to drive fifteen miles, answered it\r\nwas just an hour less than he intended to have taken. The drivers\r\nreceive no gratuity from passengers, and can only be acted on by\r\ncivility.\r\n\r\nThe state of the weather and stage-coach conveyance prevented our\r\nenjoying the scenery of the valley of the Mohawk as I expected; and\r\nafter passing Little Falls, I exchanged places with a friend on the box\r\nseat. The object appearing, when the sun was approaching the horizon,\r\nwas the German flats in the neighbourhood of the Herkeimer. But the\r\nshortness of twilight soon shut the landscape from my sight, and the\r\nbrilliancy of the fire-fly alone remained to attract attention.\r\n\r\nI again passed through this part of the valley of the Mohawk, in the end\r\nof October following, when the weather was fine, in a canal packet,\r\nwhich afforded a better opportunity of seeing the scenery than\r\ntravelling by stages, as on the former occasion. There is no part of\r\nAmerica which I visited so interesting as this valley, which happily\r\ncombines the beauties of nature with the comforts of man. The Mohawk is\r\na moderate sized stream, according to the conceptions of a Briton, and\r\nwends its way gently through a valley, bounded by verdant hills, adorned\r\nwith an infinite variety of vegetable productions. The road and canal in\r\nmany places approach the verge of the river, where the scenery assumes\r\nthe boldest character, and the different objects around Little Falls\r\nhave few equals in any part of the world. The bottom of the valley\r\naffords evidence of successful cultivation, and its beautiful sloping\r\nsides are thickly covered with cattle and sheep browsing on the herbage.\r\nThe country around the Herkeimer, near which the West Canada creek joins\r\nthe Mohawk, as seen from the canal, is truly fertile, and the\r\ninhabitants of the valley apparently wealthy and happy.\r\n\r\nIn New England States, I observed a few plants of a class known to\r\nBritish farmers as wild mustard, chadlock, &c. &c., and which appears to\r\nme _raphanus raphanustrum_, but not in such numbers as to injure the\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nOn entering the State of New York, the _raphanus_ was common, and\r\nmethought I could distinguish the wild turnip from the stage-windows.\r\nBetween Schenectady and Little Falls, these weeds, in one or two\r\ninstances, were choking the crops. The wheat crops throughout the valley\r\nof the Mohawk were good; the Indian corn had suffered severely from\r\nfrost and the overflowing of the river, which had, a few weeks before,\r\nattained a most unusual height, and imparted a disagreeable appearance\r\nto much of the land, which was little elevated above the river.\r\n\r\nUtica is situated on the Erie canal, and is a handsome, thriving place,\r\ncontaining about 10,000 inhabitants, and became a city in 1832. We\r\nagain, after a few hours’ rest, proceeded on our journey, and reached\r\nAuburn, where we stopped for the night.\r\n\r\nAt Manlius we dined with a large party of travellers, who arrived by\r\ndifferent stages, and afforded several marked instances of cooing, which\r\nthe newly-married people of this country seem to indulge in. During this\r\nday’s travelling, and on other occasions, the behaviour of such people\r\nappeared, to our British notions, verging on indelicacy, and completely\r\nat variance with the general opinion of English writers, who suppose\r\nthat the females of the United States are treated with neglect. Judging\r\nfrom what, of this nature, came under my notice in different parts of\r\nthe country, I was led to think the American husbands attentive in the\r\nhighest degree, and some of the ladies absolutely spoiled by too much\r\nattention. In almost every hotel chairs at the head of public tables are\r\nreserved for ladies, and they invariably occupy the principal seats in\r\nstage-coaches.\r\n\r\nThis day (21st June) the weather was warm, the thermometer in the stage,\r\nwhich is open on each side to the free admission of air, indicating 82\r\ndegrees at five P.M. Fortunately, myself and two friends were the only\r\npassengers after dinner, and we enjoyed a rapid drive through a fine\r\ncountry; there being no regularity with regard to time, the speed of the\r\nstages is often in the inverse ratio of the number of passengers. The\r\nprospect from the village of Onondaga-hill, which has two churches, is\r\nbeautiful and extensive, embracing Onondaga lake and the villages of\r\nSyracuse and Salina. Beyond Onondaga-hill is Marcellus, which reminded\r\nme of the villages of New England, and is the prettiest place seen to\r\nthe west of Albany. A farther drive of six miles brought us to\r\nSkeneatiles, situated at the foot of the lake bearing the same name,\r\nwhich, unruffled by the wind, and gilded by the rays of the setting sun,\r\nwas sleeping in bright tranquillity. Skeneatiles is more beautiful than\r\nMarcellus—contains about 1200 inhabitants, and every thing in the\r\nvillage and neighbourhood indicates wealth and prosperity. At seven in\r\nthe evening we reached Auburn, the seat of a state-prison, where the\r\nsystem of prison discipline, so justly celebrated, was first introduced.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, the 22d June, we pursued our journey, passing over\r\nCayuga lake by a remarkable wooden bridge, upwards of a mile in length.\r\nThe lake is here very shallow. The bridge rests on posts, and was in a\r\ndangerous state for want of repairs. A new bridge was being formed,\r\nadjoining the old one, and seemingly of improved construction. Seneca\r\nfalls and Waterloo are thriving villages, through which we passed, and\r\nreached Geneva in time for dinner. We stopped at the Franklin hotel,\r\nkept by Mr Mann, a most obliging individual, and where we found a large\r\nparty, consisting chiefly of travellers. The table was well stored with\r\nbrandy, which, with exception of water, was the only liquid; and my\r\nfriend, who is well known for sobriety of character, drank more of it\r\nthan all the rest of the company put together.\r\n\r\nHaving letters to several people in Geneva, induced me to remain some\r\ntime. Next day we attended divine worship at a Dutch reform church, and\r\nevery thing which came under notice at Geneva, showed the Sabbath to be\r\nobserved with propriety. Monday, the 24th June, proved wet, and so cold,\r\nthat fires in the public rooms of the hotel were courted for their\r\nwarmth. The rain ceasing about noon, we walked after dinner round the\r\nnorth end of the lake, to visit a farmer from Dumfries-shire, Scotland.\r\n\r\nMr J—— possesses strong natural parts, and is an instance of what\r\nenergetic and persevering industry is capable of accomplishing in this\r\ncountry. On his first arrival he was very poor, and often employed\r\nhimself in carrying wheat for hire. One year he raised by his own labour\r\n900 bushels of wheat, with only the assistance of a small boy in\r\nharrowing, while he himself was engaged in sowing. His farm is now his\r\nown property; and this season he has sixty acres in wheat, equal to any\r\ncrop of similar extent I ever examined. His system is to sow clover\r\namongst wheat, which affords good pasturage in autumn, and is fed off in\r\nthe following spring; the land is ploughed in the end of June, and after\r\nan imperfect fallowing, sown with wheat in autumn. The Dutch farmers in\r\nthe neighbourhood also sow clover with the wheat crop, which in spring\r\nis ploughed down for manure, without being fed off. This shows how much\r\nnature does for the farmer,—one year providing manure, and in the next a\r\nwheat crop. Skill might improve the system followed, but the period of\r\nintroducing advanced agriculture into the United States has not yet\r\narrived. Mr J—— applies fifty heaped Winchester bushels of lime to an\r\nacre, which costs nine cents, or 4½d sterling, per bushel. Gypsum costs\r\nfifteen cents per bushel, and is only used for clover and Indian corn.\r\nThis being the season of applying it to the latter, people were carrying\r\nit in baskets, and putting a pinch on each hill or cluster of plants.\r\nHalf a bushel is sufficient for an acre, and imparts an improved\r\nappearance to the crop in four days, except on black soft land, where it\r\nhas little effect.\r\n\r\nMr J—— feeds labourers on the best of fare, and finds no want of them at\r\nany time. His wheat crop is cut with the cradle scythe at $1 a-day and\r\nfound, that is boarded—and two binders follow the cradler at 62½ cents.\r\nWheat is cradled at $1½ per acre, and grass at $⅝, labourers finding\r\nthemselves—and the work well done in both cases. Americans, Dutch,\r\nEnglish, Irish, and Scotch, he finds work equally well. All his crop,\r\nincluding hay, is housed, and he considers a dollar per bushel a good\r\nprice for wheat.\r\n\r\nA good many sheep were shown us, a mixture of Saxon and Merino blood,\r\nwhich are not anointed with any kind of liquor or salve, and never\r\nstricken with fly. They are kept in courts during winter, fed on hay,\r\nand lamb betwixt 20th April and 20th May. Mr J——’s flock was in better\r\ncondition than any yet seen, though poor, and the lambs were\r\nstarvelings, compared with those reared in the cultivated parts of my\r\nnative district. He says his sheep seldom die, having only lost two out\r\nof five hundred in the course of two years, and the mortality amongst\r\nlambs was not much greater. The price of his ewes, when the lambs are\r\nweaned, is $3, and that of two-year old wedders, $2 and $2½. Fleeces\r\nweigh 3½lb., and his wool at present is worth 60 cents per lb.\r\n\r\nWe examined a large collection of wool belonging to Mr R——, which was of\r\nfine quality. He told us one of his yearling wedders, weighing 29lb.\r\nyielded 2lb. 9oz. of wool; and the small size of this sheep induced him\r\nto think an acre of ground would yield as much fine wool as coarse. But\r\nthe data furnished by this animal are not satisfactory, as its wool and\r\ncarcass, in all probability, bore a different proportion in the\r\npreceding autumn; since which, the latter may have decreased, and the\r\nformer increased. The carcass of a live wedder, weighing 29lb., must\r\nhave consisted only of bone and sinew; and the weight of wool, compared\r\nwith that of the sheep, may be held as evidence of wretched condition,\r\nand not of superiority of wool-growing.\r\n\r\nMr J——’s cows were beautiful animals, and very fat. For some days past a\r\ngreat improvement in the condition of cattle had been observed, arising,\r\nperhaps, from better pastures, and the advance of the season. There was\r\nalso an obvious change in the inhabitants, having seen more corpulent\r\nmen since leaving Schenectady than in all our previous wanderings in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMr Stuart, in his “Three Years’ Residence in America,” remarks, there\r\nare few lean animals; but observation leads me to a different\r\nconclusion—cows, sheep, and pigs, taken collectively, being apparently\r\nthe leanest and most neglected creatures I ever saw in any country. The\r\ncondition of the horse is greatly superior to that of other animals, yet\r\nmany are met with on the Erie canal equal in wretchedness to the most\r\noverwrought animal in Britain. Combining the price of the animal and of\r\nfood, the daily expense of a horse is much higher in Britain than in the\r\nUnited States, while the wages of his driver are proportionally lower;\r\nhence a poor, weak, lame horse may be an object of profit in the one\r\ncountry long after he ceases to be so in the other, and the fatness of\r\nthe American horses is not owing to abundance of food in the country, or\r\nhumanity in the people.\r\n\r\nWe examined a farm within three quarters of a mile of Geneva, belonging\r\nto Mr W——, consisting of 280 acres, 200 of which were cleared, fenced,\r\nand subdivided, with good dwelling-house, two servants’ houses, suitable\r\noffices, and a large productive orchard, for which he asked $35, or L.7,\r\n5s. 10d. sterling per acre. The public burdens affecting the property\r\nwere eighteen days’ labour of a man yearly for road-making, and $2 for\r\nschool-tax. There is a flour-mill on an outlet of the lake, propelled by\r\nan endless screw lying horizontally in the stream, which, for want of\r\nfall, is unsuitable for any common machinery. A steam flour-mill had\r\nbeen set a-going in the village a few days before our arrival.\r\n\r\nGeneva is situated on the west side of lake Seneca, near its northern\r\nextremity, commanding a view of the lake, which is the most beautiful\r\nsheet of water in America. There is a college, four churches, a bank,\r\nand other public buildings. The chief part of the village consists of a\r\nsquare, and a street of neat villas running parallel to the lake, on\r\nwhich a steam-boat plies daily to the extremity, distant thirty-five\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Geneva to Lewistown—Land offered for\r\n    Sale—Canandaigua—Genesee Country—Variations of\r\n    Temperature—Agricultural Notices—American and Scotch notions of\r\n    Reverted Wheat—Genesee Flats—Mr Wadesworth—Avon—Wood\r\n    Bridges—Girdling Trees—Falls of the Genesee—Rochester—Ridge\r\n    Road—Face of the Country._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Geneva in the morning by a stage-coach, and after travelling\r\nthrough a country of clay soil, badly farmed, but bearing excellent\r\nwheat crops, arrived at Canandaigua. Having a letter to a Scotch\r\ngentleman residing there, I discovered him by his national appearance\r\nwhen riding on the street. I was gratified at visiting him, and in\r\nviewing his new house and fine garden, one of the rarest sights in\r\nAmerica. The necessity of proceeding with the object of my tour,\r\nprevented me sharing his sincere hospitality, and I returned to\r\nBlossom’s Hotel, and dined in an excellent room of large dimensions. In\r\nthe afternoon we walked four miles in the direction of Mills, to view\r\nsome lands for sale, and found the soil and wheat crops on the road\r\ngenerally good. For fine cleared land $25 per acre was asked; and a\r\nperson accosted me on the road and offered his farm of 100 acres, and\r\nhis father’s of the same extent, with suitable offices, at $28 per acre.\r\nAlmost every farmer in the eastern States who has a family, or is in\r\nstraitened circumstances, is willing to sell his land and move to the\r\nwestern States, where he can obtain soil of equal quality, and in a\r\nfiner climate, at a twentieth part of the price; and foreigners, who are\r\neasily known, and supposed to be in search of land, are constantly asked\r\nto purchase farms.\r\n\r\nCanandaigua is situated near the outlet of the Lake of the same name,\r\nwhich is navigated by a steam-boat. The principal street extends back on\r\nrising ground nearly two miles, and consists of separate villas, as\r\nwhite and clean as paint can make them, with green Venetian blinds,\r\nsituated at some distance from the street, and surrounded with\r\numbrageous vegetation, which at this warm season imparted an appearance\r\nof coolness and luxury. Besides a garden in front, crowded with rose\r\nbushes bearing a profusion of flowers, many villas have a considerable\r\nextent of ground behind, capable of maintaining animals, and affording\r\nevery family convenience. The buildings and beauty of Canandaigua\r\nsurpass any place I have seen out of New England; and the wealth and\r\ncomfort of its inhabitants may be owing to its early erection and\r\nsituation in the Genesee country, the most celebrated wheat district in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Genesee country was sold by the State of Massachusetts to Messrs\r\nGorham and Phelps, who obtained 6,000,000 acres, at about eightpence\r\nsterling per acre; but finding difficulty in fulfiling their bargain,\r\nthe land passed into other hands, and part of the country now belongs to\r\nthe Pulteney family of England.\r\n\r\nWe left Canandaigua by a stage-coach at three o’clock in the morning,\r\nand suffered considerably from cold. When day dawned, a little after\r\nfour o’clock, my thermometer, exposed on the outside of the stage,\r\nindicated 43°, and at Allanshill, on the outside of the hotel window,\r\n45°. On different occasions I experienced inconvenience from variations\r\nof temperature in America, which are greater and as frequent as those of\r\nBritain. We reached the village of Genesee early in the forenoon, and\r\nfrom the courts being then sitting, could not be received where the\r\nstages stopped. The landlord and driver were not accommodating, but we\r\nsoon found a very attentive hotel-keeper in a different part of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the country, from Canandaigua to Genesee, is undulating\r\nand picturesque, but ill cultivated. The wheat crops generally good, and\r\na considerable extent of ground preparing for fallow, by breaking up\r\ngrass land which had been depastured. In some cases, four oxen and a\r\nhorse were dragging a plough, a boy riding the horse in front, and a\r\ndriver to the oxen. In every case, a driver was employed with oxen, and\r\nhorses generally ridden by boys when in the plough, which, I supposed,\r\nwas owing to their being little accustomed to this kind of labour.\r\n\r\nI had observed the wheat crops of America abounding with a species of\r\ngrass passing by the name of chess, which I imagine to be the _Bromus\r\nsecalinus_ of botanists, and which I have seen in the wheat crops of\r\nSurrey, England, and south of Ireland. A passenger between Canandaigua\r\nand Genesee, stated, that chess was reverted wheat, and originated from\r\nan inclement season, or bad seed, an opinion which I found pretty\r\ngeneral in the States and Canada. This doctrine was made known to me by\r\nletters in the Genesee Farmers’ newspaper, published at Rochester,\r\nnumbers of which I received in Scotland, but it is so different to my\r\nobservation and reflection, that I told the passenger, I would as soon\r\nexpect a horse to become a pig, as wheat chess. From extensive\r\nobservation in remote parts of America, I have not a doubt of chess\r\nbeing indigenous to the soil, and hence its growth amongst wheat crops,\r\nwhere the farmer did not sow its seeds.\r\n\r\nAkin to the notion of wheat reverting to chess, is that of the same\r\ngrain changing to darnel (_Lolium temuluctum_), lately advanced in\r\nScotland, where the plant is provincially called sleepies. Botanists\r\nassign original types for cultivated plants, but farmers seem not to be\r\nagreed about that of wheat. Americans may arrange themselves on the side\r\nof chess, Scotchmen that of darnel, without throwing light on the\r\nsubject. A plant cannot change from one species to another, or the\r\nvegetable kingdom would pass into confusion. Wheat, chess, and darnel,\r\nare distinct species.\r\n\r\nHaving heard much of the Genesee flats, I proceeded to call on their\r\nowner, on arriving at Genesee. Mr Wadesworth had gone to a distant part\r\nof the country, one of his sons being the only member of the family at\r\nhome, and who had rode out after breakfast. On calling a second time,\r\nthe young gentleman pointed out the way to the flats, where he said he\r\nwould join us in an hour afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Genesee flats belonging to Mr Wadesworth, are rich alluvial soil,\r\nornamented with aged trees, deposited in groups and at intervals; and\r\nperhaps no gentleman’s park in Britain equals them in fertility and\r\nbeauty. They differ from the rest of the surface in this part of the\r\ncountry, by having been cleared by nature, and are chiefly in grass,\r\naffording the richest pasturage I ever saw, with exception of some\r\nfields in the neighbourhood of Boston, Lincolnshire, England. On\r\nexamining some parts which had never been subjected to the plough, red\r\nand white clovers were particularly abundant, also timothy grass\r\n(_Phleum pratense_), and several kinds of poea. Cocksfoot was less\r\ncommon, and a few spikes of tall oat-like grass (_Holcus avenaceus_).\r\nRye-grass or yellow-flowering clovers were not visible. A field was\r\npointed out which had been mown for hay thirty-five successive years,\r\nwithout top-dressing, and the grasses were still in vigour of growth,\r\ninterspersed with red clover nearly thirty inches high.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman joined us on the flats, and pointed out every thing\r\ndeserving of notice. The sheep were a mixture of Merino and Saxon\r\nbreeds, and not fat looking. There was a fine short-horn bull, intended\r\nto improve the dairy stock, which I did not see. This contemplated\r\nimprovement originated from perusing the writings of the Rev. Henry\r\nBerry of England; and I took the liberty of advising the cross to be\r\ntried on a small scale, believing the short-horns the worst milking\r\nbreed in Britain. This opinion was new to the gentleman, who said he\r\nwould keep it in view, and proceed cautiously in intermixing the breeds.\r\nThe grazing cattle were extremely numerous—four-year-olds, which had\r\nbeen bought in spring, and kept on hay till the arrival of grass, on\r\nwhich they are to be fatted. Mr Wadesworth intends to cultivate wheat\r\nextensively; and one enclosure, as a beginning, was bearing an\r\nindifferent crop. I have often observed wheat not succeed well on very\r\nrich ground, and that, in Britain, the United States, and Canada, soils\r\nwhich have been long under cultivation, yield the best crops of this\r\ngrain when properly managed. There was a variety of implements which\r\nbrought to recollection those at Holkham, Norfolk, England. Amongst\r\nothers, a mowing machine was exhibited and descanted on. We were shown a\r\nfine oak-tree growing on the banks of the river, and said to be\r\ntwenty-four feet in circumference.\r\n\r\nWe passed the evening at the house of Mr Wadesworth, in agreeable and\r\ninstructive conversation with the young gentleman, whose acquirements\r\nand intelligence were of a superior description. He expressed regret at\r\nthe necessity of leaving home next day, but offered to place at my\r\ndisposal his father’s carriage, horses, and driver, with introductory\r\nletters to his friends in the neighbourhood, and said he himself would\r\nshow us the country on the day following. Time would not admit of\r\nembracing the kind offer, and I notice this attention as creditable to a\r\nperson of the highest influence and station, on whose good offices I had\r\nno claim. It has been my fortune to experience attention from eminent\r\nagriculturists in all ranks of life in Britain, and while the heart must\r\nbe held as the seat of kindness, I can bear testimony to having found\r\ntrue agricultural knowledge, distinguished from what is empirical,\r\nconnected with expansion of mind and liberality of sentiment.[1]\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The following extract is from a letter addressed to me, and dated 26th\r\n  June, 1834.—“I called on Mr Wadesworth, Genesee. The eldest of the\r\n  brothers died last year, leaving landed property to the amount of\r\n  about a million and a half of dollars. The remaining brother, a man\r\n  about seventy, inherits it all. His family consists of two sons and a\r\n  daughter, the eldest of the sons was on his marriage jaunt.\r\n  Immediately after introduction I was placed on a good horse, and\r\n  directed down to the farm, of about 1200 acres, where I found your\r\n  friend amongst the cattle, without his coat, and I could not help\r\n  smiling as I contrasted him with our frivolous game-preserving lairds\r\n  at home. With a mind infinitely superior to most of them, and the most\r\n  unexceptionable manners, he considered it no disgrace to be actively\r\n  engaged in business. I found him agreeable and communicative.”\r\n\r\nNext morning we left Genesee and passed through Avon, frequented for its\r\nmineral springs, and beauty of situation. While the horses were\r\nchanging, we found many people indulging in copious draughts of water,\r\nwhich I prevailed on my friend D—— to taste, when he amused the\r\nbystanders by making a wry face, and exclaiming in a serious tone of\r\nvoice, “Do people really drink that for health?” We dined at a stage\r\nhouse, and were much annoyed by a tipsy person whose impertinence called\r\nfor an exercise of patience. He was descended of Irish parents, said to\r\npossess property, and seemingly an excellent customer to the bar-room.\r\nOn reaching Rochester, I remarked to the driver, that he seemed to be\r\ntraversing the same street twice in setting down passengers, and learned\r\nthat he was afraid to cross a certain bridge, through which one of his\r\nhorses fell a few days before and broke a leg. Few things in America\r\nappear more striking to a Briton than the wretched state of the wooden\r\nbridges, a material which he does not associate with strength or\r\ndurability. We took up our quarters at the Eagle tavern, the landlord of\r\nwhich was attentive and accommodating.\r\n\r\nThe soil from Genesee to Rochester is chiefly clay, bearing excellent\r\nwheat, and nineteen-twentieths of the land in crop was producing this\r\ngrain. I observed a good wheat crop amongst girdled oak-trees, in a\r\nfield of considerable extent. Girdling is effected by cutting a ring\r\nthrough the bark round the tree, which does not again put forth leaves,\r\nby which sun beams and air are admitted to plants on the surface of the\r\nearth. This mode of improvement is only followed amongst oaks, the roots\r\nof which strike perpendicularly into the earth, and consequently are\r\nfavourable to the progress of the plough; but the trees become more\r\nobdurate, and girdling is only excusable in the first operations of a\r\nnew settler.\r\n\r\nWe lost no time in viewing the sights of Rochester, the chief of which\r\nis the fall of the Genesee river, ninety-seven feet in height, and\r\ncelebrated by the ill-fated leap of Sam Patch in 1829. We enjoyed a walk\r\ndown the banks of the stream on a lovely evening, but the scenery in the\r\nneighbourhood of the fall has been injured by the erection of machinery\r\npropelled by the water. The flour mills are numerous, and on the most\r\nextensive scale, said to be capable of manufacturing 12,000 bushels of\r\nwheat in twenty-four hours. There is an arcade, extolled by the\r\ninhabitants, but possessing no attractions to individuals who have seen\r\nthose of other countries. Rochester is one of the many places\r\nillustrative of the growing wealth and population of the United States,\r\nand which some English travellers ridicule for want of antiquity, on the\r\nprinciple a withered old beau affects to despise the freshness and\r\nelasticity of youth. The first settlement took place in 1812, and the\r\npopulation is now estimated at about 14,000. The situation of the town,\r\ncommunicating with Lake Erie, and the extensive waters to the west, by\r\nmeans of the Erie canal, which is carried over the river in the middle\r\nof the town by an aqueduct of free stone, 800 feet long—with Lake\r\nOntario by a railroad—with Montreal by the St Lawrence, and with New\r\nYork by the Hudson, together with its splendid water power, renders its\r\nincrease of wealth and population almost without limits.\r\n\r\nNext morning we set out for Lewistown by way of Lockport, travelling on\r\nwhat is termed the ridge-road, a natural formation extending round the\r\nsouth end of Lake Ontario, at a distance of eight or ten miles from the\r\npresent waters, and nearly a hundred feet higher. It is from twenty-five\r\nto fifty feet wide, fifteen to twenty feet above the surrounding\r\ncountry, and composed of sand and gravel. The road is supposed to have\r\nformed the margin of the lake at some remote period of the world, but I\r\nhad not sufficient opportunity to form an opinion on this point.\r\n\r\nThe country through which we travelled, after leaving Rochester, is more\r\nrecently settled than any yet seen, the fields being thickly covered\r\nwith black stumps overtopping the wheat crops; and the felling and\r\nburning of trees was going on in all directions. The houses were mere\r\nlog-huts, and wanting in external comforts. The warm state of the\r\nweather induced the inhabitants to throw open the doors and windows,\r\naffording an opportunity of seeing the internal arrangements, and I can\r\ntestify to their well-stored tables and general neatness. The crops were\r\nbad, and much of the soil so inferior as not likely to repay those\r\nengaged in clearing it of timber.\r\n\r\nAfter a fatiguing ride, we reached Lewistown, a thriving village, at\r\nmidnight, and found the bar-keeper and porter of the hotel intoxicated,\r\nwhich was the only instance of the kind I met during my transatlantic\r\ntour. By this time we had learned to take things as we found them, and\r\nin a few minutes our baggage and selves were in bedrooms without\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  _Niagara River and Falls—Carving—Entrance to Canada—Cavern beneath the\r\n    Falls—Rapids—City Building—Stage Passenger—General Brock’s\r\n    Monument—Letters—Maps—Queenstown and Niagara—Agricultural\r\n    Notices—King—Old Settlers—Disappointment with Canada._\r\n\r\n\r\nAware of being near the Niagara river, which connects Lake Erie with\r\nOntario, and which forms the St Lawrence, my first proceeding in the\r\nmorning was to obtain a sight of this stream, from the window. The sun\r\nshone brightly, and displayed to advantage the white painted houses and\r\nendless forest, but there was no feature indicating a river. On walking\r\na short distance from the hotel I unexpectedly found myself on the banks\r\nof the Niagara, moving in the midst of a flat country, betwixt low\r\nwoodless banks void of beauty. On the opposite side lay Upper Canada;\r\nthe village of Queenstown was seen in the distance, over which Sir Isaac\r\nBrock’s monument was towering. I looked on the scene with feelings of a\r\nBritish subject, and, with a thousand associations rushing on my mind,\r\nanticipated new enjoyment from mingling with the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we were seated in a stage on the way to the Falls of\r\nNiagara, winding up a steep hill, corresponding with elevated ground on\r\nthe Canada side, called the heights of Queenstown. From the summit, the\r\npassengers expatiated on the extent and beauty of the prospect, but\r\nbeing unfortunately seated between two stout individuals, I was deprived\r\nof seeing objects at a distance. I could, however, perceive that the\r\nbanks of the river, along which we travelled, underwent a change on\r\nreaching the height, being rocky, precipitous, and deep. It is\r\nconjectured, and appearances support the theory, that the cataract of\r\nNiagara once poured its torrents over this spot, and that it has receded\r\nto its present position, seven miles distant, by the gradual wearing of\r\nthe rock. The soil from Lewistown, along the river, is inferior, bearing\r\nbad crops.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the village of Manchester, situated on the rapids of the\r\nriver, we instantly sallied forth to view the Falls of Niagara, which I\r\nhad long considered the most wonderful sight in the world. A remarkable\r\nand fragile-looking bridge leads across the rapids to Goat island, and\r\nwe soon stood on what is termed the American falls, formed by that part\r\nof the river passing on the south side of the island.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it was owing to unreasonable expectations, or the\r\nmagnitude and sublimity of the object, that I felt disappointed on first\r\nviewing the falls. Instead of being riveted to the spot in breathless\r\nagitation, and soul-thrilling delight, a feeling of uneasiness stole\r\nover me, from which I sought relief by culling a variety of plants from\r\nthe edge of the cataract. But every sight afforded additional pleasure,\r\nand hours flitted away in gazing on their endless beauties.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the hotel, a large and good establishment, numerous\r\nvisitors of the falls had assembled for dinner, to which they did\r\njustice, thinking, perhaps, the grosser senses entitled in turn to\r\ngratification. Guests are not expected to carve, waiters either doing\r\nso, or carrying dishes to those wishing to help themselves. The numerous\r\ncompany induced me to cut up a joint, and having served a dozen of\r\nindividuals, I was about to help myself, when the fragments were\r\nexpeditiously carried off and placed before a gentleman at the extremity\r\nof the table. Amused at the way I had been treated, I resolved to\r\ninvolve a companion in the disappointment, by asking him to help me to\r\nmutton. He complied, and no other person was so honoured during his\r\ntour. Foreigners may well be excused carving, their utmost exertions\r\nbeing required to finish meals with the natives.\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner we set out for the Pavilion House, a celebrated\r\nhotel in Canada, a porter conveying our luggage in a barrow to the\r\nferry, which we reached by descending a wooden spiral staircase. The\r\nriver is 1200 yards broad. The agitated state of the waters conveys an\r\nidea of danger, and we were landed safely on the opposite beach in 14\r\nminutes, having been drenched in crossing by the spray of the falls. Mr\r\nD—— remained with the luggage, while we went in search of assistance to\r\ntransport it. Two men of colour were met carrying trunks to the ferry,\r\nwho brought ours on their return.\r\n\r\nOn the Canada side of the river, a wide road winds up the steep bank, at\r\nthe top of which were carriages of different descriptions, and people\r\nwalking to and fro. The ascent being long and difficult, afforded time\r\nfor observation. Banks, rocks, trees, carriages, and people, appeared\r\nlike those I had been accustomed to of late, and no important object\r\nindicated a change of territory. But characters of countries and\r\nindividuals may sometimes be learned from trifles. On walking up the\r\nbanks of the river, an elevated board attracted notice, containing the\r\nfollowing inscription:—“All persons found on these grounds will be\r\nprosecuted.” This was so unlike any thing I had seen in the States, that\r\nit impressed me with an idea I had left the land of liberality, if not\r\nof liberty, and recalled associations connected with notice-boards of\r\nScotland regarding steel-traps, spring-guns, and prosecutions according\r\nto law, which deface the country, and exhibit the characters of those\r\nwho erect them.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Niagara from the ferry to the Pavilion is the loveliest\r\nand most interesting portion of the globe. At the point where the\r\nfootpath diverges is the Table rock, affording the best view of the\r\nHorse-shoe fall, one of the most splendid earthly objects the eye of man\r\ncan behold. We reached the hotel in time for tea. Our bedroom windows\r\noverlooked the cataract, whose murmurings soon lulled us to repose.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when the sun was peeping above the horizon, and ere the\r\nvapour had melted before his rays, we were at the Table rock, gazing\r\nwith increased pleasure at the Horse-shoe fall, preparatory to entering\r\nthe cavern below it. In a small shanty we changed our clothes for\r\nsailcloth dresses kept for visitors, and, laughing at our grotesque\r\nappearance, descended a spiral stair to the level of the river. The\r\nguide led the way, and after a considerable battering of spray and wind\r\nin passing the verge of the cataract, the interior of the cave was\r\ncomparatively serene. We penetrated 153 feet to the Termination rock,\r\nwhere we conversed without difficulty, in a peculiar greenish light, the\r\nsun being distinctly visible through the falling sheet of water. The\r\npathway is strewed with loose stones—the debris of the falling rock—and\r\nunpleasantly narrow. The guide seemed impatient to regain the outside,\r\nand I experienced no difficulty in breathing, or uneasiness of any kind.\r\nNext day I repeated my visit, when the spray and wind were much more\r\npowerful. On this occasion, Mr C—— and I were preceded by three Yankee\r\nyouths, two of whom lost courage on encountering the spray, and nearly\r\noverturned us in their hurried retreat. There is little danger in a\r\npilgrimage to the Termination rock, and nothing to affect the nerves of\r\nan ordinary person, or to reward him, beyond the glory of having made\r\nit, and enjoying the finest of shower-baths, formed by the spray of the\r\nfalling water.\r\n\r\nThe currents of air acting on the soft under stratum in the cave, is the\r\nprimary cause of the lime rock giving way, over which the water pours,\r\nbut how they should vary so much is not easily accounted for. At both\r\nvisits the external atmosphere was still, but I did not remark the\r\ndirection of the wind, or revolve the matter in my mind. Air mingled\r\nwith water will at all times pass over the cataract, and the current in\r\nthe cave may either proceed from the agitated water below being\r\nincapable of containing the same quantity of air as that above, or from\r\nwind passing through the falling sheet, as sunbeams do through glass.\r\n\r\nAt my first visit to the cave I lifted an eel about the centre, and\r\nrestored it to the water. A toad was near the falling sheet, in full\r\nvigour of life, and on my second visit there was one near the same spot.\r\nIn the channel of the river, and amidst the thickest vapour, swallows\r\nwere whirling at all times, and occasionally seemed to pass within a few\r\ninches of the surface of the most impetuous part of the Horse-shoe fall.\r\nThe suction and danger of the falls seem to have been exaggerated, and\r\nthe noise and terror said to be experienced on viewing them, either do\r\nnot exist, or my feelings were insensible to them.\r\n\r\nAt twilight of the evening of 1st July, I walked up the Niagara to\r\ndeliver an introductory letter, when I was so much gratified with a\r\nsight of the rapids, that my friends accompanied me next night at the\r\nsame hour. No person who has not seen the rapids can form a just\r\nestimate of the quantity and force of water descending the cataract.\r\nWhen standing at the verge of the river, a hundred yards below the grist\r\nmills, and looking up the stream, the most obtuse feelings cannot fail\r\nof being touched with the spectacle. Such is the breadth and descent of\r\nthe river, that the water forms the visible horizon; and the mighty\r\nstream, in waving folds, seems issuing from the firmament. The sun had\r\nsunk to rest; the evening was soothingly still; the thin clouds of\r\nvapour rising from the falls curled gracefully over Goat island, and\r\nwere lost in the distance. The agitated rapids formed a contrast with\r\nthe serene sky emblematical of troubled earth and calm heaven.\r\n\r\nConscious of my inability to do justice, in the way of description, to\r\nthe Falls of Niagara, when so many higher-gifted individuals have failed\r\nin the attempt, the works of travellers must be consulted by those\r\ninterested in the matter. They will find descriptions, like the actual\r\nfalls, abounding in so many beauties, that readers, like visitors, may\r\nselect what is suited to their taste. Visitors, however, ought to\r\nperambulate the banks of the river and islands in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe falls, and begin with the American or Canada side, according to\r\ntheir temperament. As few seem capable of appreciating the magnificence\r\nof the sight at first, it will generally be found the best policy to\r\nbegin with the American side, which affords opportunity of seeing both\r\nfalls; while the Horse-shoe and rapids from the Canadian side, the\r\nsublimest objects of the scene, are reserved for the last.\r\n\r\nTwo rival companies have commenced building villas on the Canada side of\r\nthe Niagara, and in all probability will lead to the embellishment and\r\nimprovement of the banks in the vicinity of the falls. The period has\r\nnot yet, however, arrived for the population resorting to villas in\r\nCanada for a few months in summer; and city building at the falls seems\r\nas visionary an undertaking as could at present be entered into.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after our arrival at the Pavilion, we entered a stage for\r\nthe village of Niagara, formerly Newark, distant twenty miles, and found\r\na passenger railing at delay. His dialect marked him from the north of\r\nScotland; he could not be made to comprehend the distinction between the\r\nrivers Niagara and St Lawrence, and amused us by some remarks on\r\ndifferent subjects. The beef of Canada, he said, was so tough that teeth\r\ncould not chew it; and on being reminded his might not now have so keen\r\nan edge as when in Scotland, replied, there could be no great change on\r\nthem, as he came to this country last fall; but when in the old country\r\nhe only got beef once a-week on Sunday, here he had it three times\r\na-day. The road is full of interest, from recent historical events, and\r\nwas fringed with various kinds of fruit-trees, bending under an abundant\r\ncrop. On reaching the heights of Queenstown, five or six individuals\r\nleft the stage and went to the top of General Brock’s monument, erected\r\nby the Government of Upper Canada to commemorate the services of that\r\nofficer, who fell in the moment of victory during the last war with the\r\nStates. The heights afford a sweet view of the junction of the Niagara\r\nwith lake Ontario, and the surrounding country; the monument commanding\r\na wider range of landscape, without diversifying the scene, and\r\ncertainly does not reward the labour of reaching the summit. The party\r\njoined the stage at Queenstown, and soon reached Niagara, having\r\ndeposited a passenger at the steam-boat on the river before entering the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nMy friend D—— found letters at the post-office of Niagara, but the like\r\nfortune did not attend me, although our letters are said to have been\r\nput into the same post-office in Scotland, and similarly directed. I did\r\nnot receive a letter from Britain while across the Atlantic, but my\r\ncommunications regularly reached their destination in Scotland. The\r\npost-office of the United States seems well conducted, but I experienced\r\nproofs to the contrary with that of Canada.\r\n\r\nFew countries are better provided with maps than the United States,\r\npocket ones being everywhere to be had, and the walls of hotels covered\r\nwith them and information regarding stages and routes. We could not\r\nobtain a map of Canada, the booksellers of Niagara informing us a pocket\r\none of the country never had been published, and almost nothing could be\r\nlearned about mails and stages, which nearly placed us in the situation\r\nof pursuing our route blindfold. Dining at the village, we returned to\r\nthe Pavilion in an extra, which corresponds to the post-chaise of\r\nBritain; and I took an opportunity of delivering some letters by the\r\nway. Queenstown and Niagara are mean dirty-looking villages, apparently\r\nwithout trade, and very unlike the clean bustling places on the opposite\r\nside of the river. The bar-rooms of the hotels we entered were filled\r\nwith swearing tipsy people, and the establishments badly conducted, from\r\nthe stage-coach to the presenting of butter; which, instead of being, as\r\nin the States, hardened by means of ice, was an unclean liquid.\r\n\r\nBetween the falls and village of Niagara the soil is partly clay and\r\npartly sand, both seemingly of indifferent quality, and bearing bad\r\ncrops. The farm-houses are untidy, and the fences look old and\r\ndilapidated. No trace of recent improvement could be discovered, and the\r\nstate of agriculture seemed stationary.\r\n\r\nI had a letter to Mr ——, whom I was requested to visit, as he had been\r\nnearly half a century in Canada, and possessed some fine farms in the\r\nneighbourhood of the falls. On enquiring at the landlord of the\r\nPavilion, if he knew any thing of the gentleman to whom the letter was\r\naddressed, I learned he was a _little king_ in this part of the world,\r\nwith whom the landlord himself had served when a boy. Impressed with the\r\nrank of the person, I asked if I might venture to breakfast with him\r\nnext morning. Yes, was the reply, you will be sure to get every thing of\r\nthe best. The import of my question being misunderstood, I was told it\r\nwas unnecessary to announce my visit beforehand. I requested an extra to\r\nbe in readiness to carry us to ——, and retired to rest, meditating on\r\nthe treat expected from walking over some of the finest farms in Canada,\r\nin company with King ——. Next morning rain fell in torrents, which\r\ndetained us till after breakfast, when we travelled by the way of St\r\nDavid’s, and at length the extra drew up at the door of a small wooden\r\ncottage. No time was lost in delivering and reading the letters; and I\r\nregretted to observe a restraint in the family, arising, perhaps, from\r\nthe extra, which probably was the only one that ever approached their\r\ndwelling. When engaged in putting questions regarding farming, in\r\npresence of father and son, the old gentleman said he would send for his\r\nman Peter, as best qualified to answer me. Peter was from Stirlingshire,\r\nScotland—had been several years in the country, and possessed more\r\ninformation and address than any of the _royal family_. He told me\r\nfarm-labourers receive $10 a-month when engaged by the year, with board.\r\nIn winter, labour can scarcely be obtained at $6 a-month, and boys\r\nsometimes engage for their food. Canadians drink less spirits than they\r\ndid at one time, and they are not now served to labourers in the field.\r\nKing —— and Prince —— boasted of making their farm implements, which a\r\nmechanic could have done at half the labour, and of treading out the\r\nwheat crop with horses. The day continuing wet, prevented a walk over\r\nthe _dominions_, and we returned to the Pavilion in time for dinner, to\r\nthe expressed regret of Mr ——, who was as kind as possible; but a\r\nprolonged stay might not have been agreeable to either party. The\r\ninterior of the house presented few marks of comfort, according to my\r\nnotions at the time, although after experience in Canada enables me to\r\nsay it was respectable in this view.\r\n\r\nThe old settlers are evidently the least enterprising class. Having come\r\nto the country uncultivated themselves, and ever since living without\r\nintercourse with the world, they seem content with the necessaries of\r\nlife, which are easily obtained. Their descendants imbibe the same\r\nsentiments and habits; and before the first settled portions of Upper\r\nCanada can be farther improved, the present farmers must either sell to\r\nothers of more enterprise, or another generation arise with new\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nI could no longer conceal the disappointment experienced with Canada and\r\nits inhabitants. The Pavilion House, so much praised by travellers,\r\nlately purchased by a company, and puffed off by advertisements, was\r\ngreatly inferior to the hotels in the States. The manners and customs of\r\nthe people were essentially Yankee, with less intelligence, civility,\r\nand sobriety. The houses and fences were inferior to those of any\r\ndistrict yet seen, and instead of the youthfulness and never-ceasing\r\nactivity of the States, there seemed the listless repose of doating age.\r\nThe brute creation partook of the change—horses, cattle, sheep, and\r\npigs, being inferior to those on the opposite side of the frontier. If\r\nsuch was the state of things in Niagara district—the paradise of Upper\r\nCanada—little could be expected from other parts of the province. My\r\nfriends, at first, seemed to regard my opinions as more the result of\r\nprejudice than observation, but in a few days after, they drew a\r\ncontrast less favourable to Canada than I had done. No unprejudiced\r\ntraveller can spend a few hours on either side of the frontier line\r\nwithout remarking the difference of the two countries, and as the\r\npeople, soil, and climate, were originally alike, the circumstances in\r\nwhich the inhabitants have been placed must alone account for the\r\ndissimilarity. If governments affect the state of countries, politicians\r\nwould do well to visit both sides of the river Niagara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  _Baffled in reaching the Western States—Buffalo—4th of July—Oneida\r\n    Indians—Fort Erie—Early Marriages—David Baxter—Petersburgh—Separate\r\n    from Companions—Musquittoes—Settlers around Dunville—Earing of\r\n    Wheat—Dunville—Face of the Country—Notices of Nature—Breaking\r\n    Fruit-trees—Bar-room Group—Junction with Companions—Visit a New\r\n    Settler—Politicians—Hamilton—York._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it was my intention to visit the Western States of the Union, my\r\nfriends agreed to accompany me round the north side of Lake Erie, and\r\ncross over to Cleveland, proceeding down the Ohio canal and river,\r\npassing north, through Illinois and Michigan, east by Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, and to Britain by the St Lawrence. We could not get information\r\nregarding roads or conveyances at the Pavilion, which we left in a stage\r\nfor Buffalo on the morning of the 3d July, to push our way in the best\r\nmanner we could, having forwarded our heavy luggage to York. The day\r\nbeing fine, the drive was delightful up the banks of the Niagara; here a\r\nbroad smooth flowing stream, divided by islands, and a few feet below\r\nthe surrounding country. The river does not at any time overflow its\r\nbanks, seldom varying ten inches in depth, a peculiarity arising from\r\nthe lakes, through which the waters flow, acting as reservoirs. The soil\r\nis clay of good quality, badly fenced, without indication of recent\r\nimprovements, and appearances did not bespeak wealth or industry in the\r\ninhabitants. At the village of Waterloo, we crossed the river in a\r\nfour-horse ferry-boat, and after passing through a country of recently\r\ncleared and inferior soil, reached the Eagle tavern at Buffalo in time\r\nfor dinner, served in a well-lighted room, 93 feet long, and crowded\r\nwith company.\r\n\r\nBuffalo is situated in the extremity of Lake Erie, at the mouth of the\r\nErie canal, and is the depôt of commerce passing between the Eastern and\r\nWestern States. In 1814, the village was reduced to one house, having\r\nbeen burned by the enemy. Now it contains many brick houses of large\r\nsize; and I was struck with the stores, or warehouses, at the wharf, and\r\nthe immense quantity of merchandise they contained. It is the chief port\r\non the lake for steam-boats—a daily line sailing for Detroit, one of\r\nwhich, in course of the season, was said to have left the pier with 800\r\npassengers on board. The Americans have fifteen steam-boats on the lake,\r\nmany of them of the largest size, and four are building. The British had\r\nnot one at this time—two small boats having been launched in course of\r\nthe season, were undergoing repair, after having made a trip or two.\r\nAmerican steamers do not touch at any port on the Canada side of Lake\r\nErie, with exception of Amherstburgh, on the river Detroit.\r\n\r\nThe 4th July is a holiday over the Union, being the anniversary of\r\nAmerican independence, and was ushered in at Buffalo with firing of\r\nguns, and other demonstrations of joy. All was again quiet by breakfast\r\ntime; and a procession was to take place at noon. Approving of keeping\r\nsuch a day in remembrance, as impressing the mind of youth with love of\r\nliberty, I felt inclined to witness the proceedings, but the necessity\r\nof continuing my journey induced me to abandon the idea.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we got on board a miserable steamer of eight horse\r\npower, which landed us at Fort Erie in Canada. On the wharf at Buffalo\r\nwe saw a number of the Oneida tribe of Indians, on their way to\r\nGreenbay, a branch of Lake Michigan. This tribe having sold their lands\r\nin the state of New York, government was conveying them to their new\r\npossessions. The poor creatures were standing in groups, dressed in\r\ntheir best attire, and many young and old of both sexes stupified by\r\nintoxication. I particularly remarked a grey-haired aged female, with a\r\ncountenance of the deepest suffering, bearing in her arms a child of\r\nspurious origin. These descendants of the original owners of the soil\r\nhave been gradually deprived of their birthright; and although Greenbay\r\nis 1000 miles from their old habitations, the white man in progress of\r\ntime will envy their new possessions, and the poor Indian will retire\r\nstill farther to the west, if drunkenness, and other vices acquired from\r\nthe whites, do not exterminate the race.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Fort Erie, consisting of four or five houses, I was\r\ndisappointed at finding that a gentleman, to whom I had a letter,\r\nresided three miles from the fort, and that it was doubtful if we could\r\nmake our way round the south side of the lake, there being no regular\r\nconveyance of any kind; but I flattered myself if we could reach\r\nGravelbay, at the mouth of the Welland canal, all difficulty would be\r\nover; and after some little enquiry, we succeeded in engaging a farmer\r\nto drive us there in his waggon.\r\n\r\nI delivered letters, and dined at Fort Erie, where a pretty little miss,\r\nwhen enquiring about her friends at Edinburgh, said her cousin, Mrs ——,\r\nwas old when married. On replying I did not think so, she added, “O\r\nyes—quite old; she was six-and-twenty.” This lady’s opinion of marriage\r\nwas pretty well expressed, and I hope she may not be disappointed in her\r\nown fate. The people of America marry early. When at Montreal, a couple\r\nwas pointed out, the lady being only thirteen years of age.\r\n\r\nThe waggon arrived soon after dinner, driven by its owner, Mr David\r\nBaxter, so much improved by change of dress, that I had difficulty in\r\nrecognising him. He was son of a captain of militia, farmed 100 acres,\r\nand owned 200 more in the London district, yet he readily left his\r\nemployment, and engaged to carry us nineteen miles for 8s. 6d. sterling.\r\nThe horses were excellent, and he said to them a thousand times, “Jim\r\nand Jerry, go-a-long; bid you both; what-you-bout? wheel-away;” and\r\nbeing good-humoured and intelligent, time passed pleasantly in the\r\nwaggon.\r\n\r\nFor eight or nine miles the shores of Lake Erie resembled the beach of\r\nthe sea. The country at some distance was wet and partly newly cleared;\r\nthe ridges eight or ten feet wide; crops, with exception of some\r\nwheat-fields, indifferent, and included a considerable extent of peas.\r\nHouses were mean; the inhabitants ragged and dirty. Cattle were small\r\nand lean. Many pigs were pictures of starvation; and on the 5th July\r\ntheir winter hair was hanging on them in matted masses, like the wool of\r\nsheep. At dusk, we reached a few log-houses, called Petersburgh, on the\r\nWelland canal, where we had one bed assigned to three of us, which was\r\noccupied by two, the third reposing on a chest, with a great coat below,\r\nand a cloak above him.\r\n\r\nWe rose at four o’clock next morning, and walked down the banks of the\r\ncanal to its junction with the lake, and some miles to the west, to see\r\na property for sale belonging to Mr ——, for which $10 per acre was\r\nasked. After breakfast, we expected a waggon and a pair of horses to\r\ntake us to Dunville, but the waggon being engaged in carrying hay, a\r\nsmall boat was provided to carry our luggage up the canal to the\r\njunction of the feeder from the grand river, in hope of getting a\r\nconveyance to Dunville. On learning the passage-boat was expected from,\r\ninstead of going to Dunville, my companions became angry, and announced\r\ntheir intention of returning to Britain without loss of time, by way of\r\nthe St Lawrence, a piece of intelligence not altogether unexpected. The\r\nluggage was the chief obstacle to our progress; and if it could have\r\nbeen dispensed with, they might have been induced to persevere. It was\r\narranged that they should proceed down the canal to St Catherine’s, and\r\nwait my arrival at Hamilton.\r\n\r\nI proceeded on foot to Dunville, distant eighteen miles, dining on poor\r\nfare at Marshville. On passing Cranberry-marsh, I was attacked by\r\nmusquittoes, which clustered chiefly behind my ears, and defended myself\r\nfor two hours by waving the branch of a tree in each hand, reaching my\r\ndestination after nightfall, having walked fifteen hours in course of\r\nthe day. My repose was disturbed by the nibbling of musquittoes; and on\r\nrising at daybreak, I found vegetation most copiously covered with dew.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day I visited settlers in the neighbourhood of\r\nDunville, resident from a few weeks to three years, and found them\r\nleading lives of privation and hardship. In every instance, they were\r\ncheerful and looking with confidence to futurity; but it was evident to\r\nme they, generally, had entangled themselves with an extent of\r\npossession far beyond their means of paying for, and at a price so much\r\nbeyond its real value, that accumulation of interest on the purchase\r\nmoney would ultimately weigh down the utmost industry. I felt for their\r\nsituation; but the morning of first settlement shone so brightly, that\r\nprognostics of a coming storm would have been disregarded, and\r\nconsidered unkind. First crops on small clearances were half suffocated\r\nfor want of air, and what came under notice, satisfied me that a settler\r\nin the forest, trusting alone to his own labour, will have difficulty in\r\nraising sufficient food for a family during the first three years.\r\n\r\nThe wheat crop of Upper Canada is sown in autumn, termed fall in this\r\npart of the world; that of the Lower Province in spring. I was informed\r\nfall-wheat sown in spring does not put forth the ear until that time\r\ntwelve-months, while the wheat of Lower Canada produces a good crop in\r\nAugust following; and in corroboration was shown, on the 7th July, a\r\ncrop of wheat just coming into ear of the spring wheat of the country,\r\nwhile one from seed, brought from Roxburghshire, Scotland, sown under a\r\nparity of circumstance, was only a few inches high, without indication\r\nof shooting into ear. This appearing inexplicable, induced me to bring\r\nhome samples of fall and spring wheats, the plants from which were\r\ndestroyed at Mungoswells by hares. I found, however, plants from Scotch\r\nwheat sown in the garden did not show a disposition to ear when sown in\r\nthe middle of May. The effects of climate on the non-earing of wheat\r\nseems the same in Britain as in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nDunville is situated on the Ouse, or Grand River, four miles from its\r\nmouth, and where the feeder of the Welland canal branches off, by means\r\nof a dam eight feet high. There are about twenty small wooden houses, a\r\ngrist and saw-mill. The river is navigable to the lake, and it is said\r\nto be in contemplation to render it so as far as Brantford by means of\r\nlocks. Dunville may increase in progress of time; at present it stands\r\namidst stagnant waters, and is a perfect bull-frog and musquitto\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have walked up the river, and across the country\r\nto Hamilton, but learning that a friend, whose dwelling I had passed,\r\nresided near the Falls of Niagara, induced me to change my route. I left\r\nDunville at five in the morning, passing along the feeder and canal to\r\nPort Robinson, and from thence by Lundyslane to my friend’s house.\r\n\r\nThe country at the junction of the Welland canal with Lake Erie is\r\nlittle cleared, and few habitations or traces of cultivation are met\r\nwith on the banks or feeder. Many trees have perished, from stagnant\r\nwater, on the margins of the feeder, and impart a gloomy aspect to the\r\nscene. Part of Cranberry-marsh is seen on the banks of the feeder; the\r\nsoil is peat-moss, thickly covered with stunted larch-trees, ten to\r\ntwenty feet high; and the water is yellow coloured, but not unpleasant\r\nto the taste. A plough, drawn by four oxen, was turning over part of the\r\nmarsh bearing grass twenty inches in height, and five or six Irishmen\r\nplanting it with potatoes on 6th July. The country improved on\r\ndescending the canal, and the banks of the Chippeway were well cleared;\r\nthe soil is dry, and some good crops of wheat and grass were seen.\r\nCattle and sheep were in considerable numbers; the inhabitants seemed\r\nwealthy, and resided in good houses.\r\n\r\nWhen near Dunville I saw, for the first time, wood-pigeons and\r\nhumming-birds, also a few carrion crows and herons, similar to those of\r\nBritain, and different kinds of hawks. On the south from the canal,\r\nannual thistles and wild mustard were growing; and on the north bank of\r\nthe feeder red and white French willow, the latter having afterwards\r\nbeen seen only in one situation.\r\n\r\nAfter an agreeable visit my friends drove me to St Catherine’s next day,\r\nto get the stage for Hamilton. On the way we met an Irish funeral,\r\naccompanied by waggons filled with both sexes, who, on approaching,\r\ndescended, and broke immense branches from cherry-trees, loaded with\r\nripe fruit. The owner of the trees halloed to the depredators in vain,\r\nand I felt indignant that they should composedly take the fruit, and\r\ndestroy the trees. I was told it is customary for the people of the\r\ncountry to help themselves to peaches and other kinds of fruit in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the arrival of the coach, I strolled into the bar-room\r\nof the hotel, which would be better named bear-room, and witnessed a\r\ngroup deserving the pencil of Cruikshank to immortalize them. The\r\nlandlord, a little, spruce, talkative Yankee, was swinging in the chair,\r\nwith his legs on the table; another individual was sitting with his face\r\nto the back of the chair, a third stretched at full length on the table;\r\nand one occupied two chairs. The forms were adorned in a similar manner,\r\nand there was only one person sitting in an upright position by the\r\nwall, fast asleep, in a state of intoxication. The subject of discussion\r\nwas a riot on the 4th July, the anniversary of North American\r\nindependence. Some boys of the village were innocently firing guns in\r\nthe morning in rear of the hotel, with which they had no connexion. The\r\nlandlord being a Yankee, the firing was considered insulting to the\r\nBritish government: a multitude assembled, broke the windows, and\r\nattempted to set fire to the hotel. The mob was said to have been headed\r\nby a justice of the peace. My friend, who drove me to St Catherine’s,\r\nsaid a travelling trunk had been found open in a wood a short time ago,\r\nin the Niagara district, containing a few articles marked with initials.\r\nHe owner was supposed to have been robbed and murdered, yet the\r\ncircumstance had passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe stage arrived with one passenger, tipsy, who placed his head on one\r\nside of the coach, with his feet out at the opposite one, and snored\r\nloudly. Next stage the driver was intoxicated, and I began to ruminate\r\non the possibility of the horses participating in the common vice.\r\n\r\nI reached Hamilton at one in the morning, and after a few hours’ sleep,\r\ntook my friends out of bed in another hotel. At separating on the banks\r\nof the Welland canal they despaired of getting a conveyance to Port\r\nRobinson, and accepted the offer of a farmer to accompany him to his\r\nhouse on the Chippeway in the evening, and be taken in his waggon next\r\nday to Hamilton. They were much pleased with the farmer and the country\r\nwhich they travelled through.\r\n\r\nOn learning that a relation, who left Britain in March, was residing in\r\nthe neighbourhood, a waggon was obtained, in which we rode out to\r\nbreakfast. The waggons of America are light, uncovered, four-wheeled\r\ncarriages, used for carrying goods or human beings, and almost the only\r\nvehicle in the country. We passed the Albion mills, situated in a\r\nromantic glen, where a rock was pointed out, over which a young woman\r\nthrew herself some years before. Being deserted by a lover, her mind\r\ngave way under the shock her feelings sustained, and the spot where she\r\nsought relief from her sufferings will long remain associated with human\r\nfrailty, and the perfidy of man. The family with which my relative\r\nresided were about to sit down to breakfast, and I tasted, for the first\r\ntime, mash, or Indian corn meal porridge. Mr C—— had only been ten days\r\non his farm, having judiciously purchased a moderate extent, including\r\nlive stock and growing crops. He converted what had been erected for a\r\nbarn into a tolerable dwelling-house; and, with sobriety and industry,\r\nwill have little difficulty in bringing up his family.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of Hamilton, to whom I had a letter of introduction,\r\nremarked, in course of conversation, he was a Whig at one time, and had\r\nlately changed and opposed the mob, as there was no end to innovation. I\r\nreplied, most people do so after sharing the pickings of Tory\r\ngovernments, not being aware at the time that he himself had lately\r\nobtained a government situation worth L.300 a-year. A feeling of toryism\r\npervaded most people in the Canadas I came in contact with, more\r\nespecially those lately arrived from Britain. Whig and Radical in the\r\nmother country, after becoming possessed of a few acres of forest in\r\nCanada, seem to consider themselves part of the aristocracy, and speak\r\nwith horror of the people and liberality. Politicians are too seldom\r\ninfluenced by patriotism and philanthropy; changing opinions as they do\r\ngarments, according to fashion and interest.\r\n\r\nHamilton is situated within half a mile of Lake Ontario, and at a short\r\ndistance from an elevated ridge passing round the head of the lake. The\r\nhouses are chiefly of wood, forming a broad street, resembling some of\r\nthe villages of the States. It is in the midst of a beautiful country,\r\nand forms one of the cleanest and most desirable places of residence in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nFrom Hamilton we proceeded to York at 10 P. M. by the mail stage, the\r\nevening being cold with bright moonshine, and the passengers walking up\r\nand down hills in crossing several creeks to ease the horses. When\r\nobjects became visible by return of day, the country seemed partially\r\nand recently cleared, and the inhabitants far from wealthy. The soil\r\nclay and sand, the former yielding good wheat and grass; the latter\r\nprevailed on approaching York, where we took up our residence at the\r\nOntario house.\r\n\r\nYork is situated on Lake Ontario, and is the seat of government of the\r\nprovince from which it derives its chief importance. Steam-boats arrive\r\nand depart almost hourly, and the inhabitants amount to about 8000. The\r\nprogress of American cities in newly settled districts seems to be\r\nuniform;—at first mean wooden houses, which, as wealth increases,\r\ngradually give way to better ones of the same material, and ultimately\r\nto those of brick or stone,—clay for making the former being almost\r\neverywhere to be had. The houses of the principal streets of York are\r\npassing from wood to brick, and in no place, during my tour, did I see\r\nmore brick erections going forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  _Excursion to Lake Simcoe—Hope—David Willson—Meeting-house—Tenets of\r\n    the Children of Peace—Northumberland Farmer—Soil—Notices—Excursion\r\n    to Niagara—Scenery of Lake Ontario—Return to York._\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day my friend D—— and I set out for Lake Simcoe by the Newmarket\r\nstage, passing along a road called Younge street, a small part of which\r\nwas Macadamized, in the vicinity of York. At Richmond hill, our dinner\r\nconsisted of roast beef alone, so tough that my friend remarked the\r\nanimal must have died in the yoke from distress. Human teeth could make\r\nlittle impression on it, and I satisfied hunger with bad bread and\r\nwater, thankful that keenness of appetite exceeded my nicety of palate.\r\nAt Newmarket we were disappointed at learning the steam-boat, passing\r\nround Lake Simcoe once a-week, had left Holland-landing shortly before\r\nour arrival, and there was no other possible mode of conveyance; I\r\ntherefore committed letters to people residing on the margin of the lake\r\nto the post-office.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we were conveyed in a waggon round the neighbourhood of\r\nNewmarket, our first stage being the village of Hope, known also by the\r\nname of Davidstown, the residence of a religious sect called the\r\n“Children of Peace,” founded by David Willson. It is upwards of four\r\nmiles from Newmarket, and consists of sixty or seventy houses scattered\r\nup and down. Not finding Mr Willson at his house, where we saw his wife,\r\na thin yellow sickly looking person, we proceeded to the counting-room,\r\na fanciful building, which was open, and no one within. Mr Willson being\r\npointed out on the street, I introduced myself as a stranger anxious to\r\nsee his place of worship, to which he dryly assented. He asked if I\r\nbelonged to government, and on learning the object of my tour, and place\r\nof residence, two men who accompanied him enquired anxiously about\r\nScotland, and the state of the working classes there. On entering the\r\nbuilding we took off our hats, placing them on a table, and were told we\r\nmight walk round the house.\r\n\r\nThe building is of wood, painted white externally, seventy feet high,\r\nand consists of three stories. The first is sixty feet square, with a\r\ndoor in the centre of each side, and three large windows on each side of\r\nthe door. On two sides there is a representation of the setting sun, and\r\nthe word “Armageddon” inscribed below. The second story is twenty-seven\r\nfeet square, with three windows on each side; and the third story nine\r\nfeet square, with one window on each side. The corners of each of the\r\nstories are terminated by square lanterns, with gilded mountings, and\r\nthe termination of the building is a gilded ball of considerable size.\r\nThe interior was filled with wooden chairs placed round sixteen pillars,\r\nin the centre of which is a square cabinet of black walnut, with a door\r\nand windows on each side. There was a table in the centre of the cabinet\r\ncovered with black velvet, hung with crimson merino and fringe, on which\r\nwas deposited a Bible. On the four centre pillars were painted the words\r\n“Faith, Hope, Charity, and Love;” and on the twelve others, I believe,\r\nthe names of the Apostles. The centre pillars seemed to support the\r\nsecond story, and at the foot of each was a table covered with green\r\ncloth. The house was without ornament, being painted fawn, green, and\r\nwhite, and had not a pulpit or place for addressing an audience. It is\r\noccupied only once in a month for collecting charity, contains 2952\r\npanes of glass, and is lighted once a-year with 116 candles.\r\n\r\nThere was a cold suspicious reserve in Mr Willson’s manner, which\r\nprevented me at first engaging him in conversation. After fruitless\r\nattempts I remarked the temple was a handsome building, and he muttered\r\nin satirical sounds, “we did not wish to raise a temple, it is only a\r\nmeeting-house.” I said the interior of the building was tastefully\r\nfinished, and asked if the design was his own,—when he repulsively\r\nreplied, “Did you ever see one like it?” On answering in the negative,\r\nhe said, with a great deal of self-complacency, “That is the work of the\r\nmind.” I had now a key to his good graces, which was used, and he\r\nconversed freely on a variety of subjects. I had a publication in my\r\npocket, entitled “Canada as it is,” wherein he was mentioned; and on\r\nreading the particulars, he emphatically said, “Part is true—but\r\nthree-fourths are lies.” From seeing Mr Owen’s name in the book, he said\r\nhe had his writings, and asked how he got on in Scotland. I stated\r\nshortly his late career, and he seemed pleased at hearing of the\r\nbreaking up of New Harmony.\r\n\r\nDavid Willson seems about 65 years of age, and is a middle sized, square\r\nbuilt man, wearing his hair over his forehead, and squints considerably.\r\nHe reminded me of my early friend and preceptor, Edward Irving, but the\r\nassociation, in all probability, arose more from semblance of character\r\nthan of feature. He was dressed in a short brown cloth jacket, white\r\nlinen trowsers, with a straw hat, all perhaps home-made. Originally from\r\nthe State of New York, he had resided thirty years in this country. The\r\nnumber of his followers is unknown, but all offering themselves in\r\nsincerity are accepted, as he dislikes sectarianism, and has no written\r\ncreed. He seems to act on Quaker principles, assisting the flock with\r\nmoney and advice. The produce is sent to York market weekly in common,\r\nyet individuals are left to guide themselves. There is a school for\r\nteaching young women to be industrious, whether they join the sect or\r\nnot. Most people in the neighbourhood say the “Children of Peace” are\r\ngood people, but scandal has been busy with their leader.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Mr Willson he presented me with a small tract, which may be\r\nregarded as the tenets of the family, to the following effect.\r\n\r\n  “MATTHEW, CHAPTER XXV. VERSE 34.\r\n\r\n  “_Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye\r\n  blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\r\n  foundation of the world; for I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I\r\n  was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me\r\n  in; naked, and ye clothed me._”\r\n\r\n  “I make use of this text to explain the purposes of a building erected\r\n  at the small village of Hope, in the county of York, and province of\r\n  Upper Canada.—We who are distinguished from other worshippers, of our\r\n  country, by the name of Peace, which name we have given to our place\r\n  of worship, here insert singular purposes, not generally known to our\r\n  friends abroad; we esteem all such who are not our enemies; these\r\n  latter, in a literal sense, cannot be our brethren or our friends.\r\n\r\n  “The world is in a singular system to us, as we can be to them; that\r\n  is, that they are in a state of servitude to a set of Christian\r\n  priests, since Christ came to liberate the captives. The objector may\r\n  say, they are in no servitude on the classical plan, but what is\r\n  voluntary. I answer, a child should be directed in his choice, and a\r\n  disciple taught to pray. We confess the people are directed in their\r\n  choice, and invited to be baptized, join society, and partake of the\r\n  holy ordinances. If we may give the ancient names to the present\r\n  apostles, Peter saith come, for this is the way, and I can prove it by\r\n  scripture; Paul saith come, for I can condemn the very creed that\r\n  Peter approves, and justify mine own to an extreme. Now, we are of the\r\n  mind to leave the creeds of the Christian Apostles of this age (of\r\n  which they have no scant number) and take into a simple way, in which\r\n  there can be no dispute, and which, we think, will outwit the priests\r\n  of the Christian church to condemn. We take the words of Christ our\r\n  Saviour for truth, but to believe in all the contradictions of the\r\n  age, is to us impossible. Priests quarrel now for titles; the printers\r\n  print them, and sell them to the world, and make barter of priests’\r\n  disputes; and the clashing of creeds has become a popular trade, and\r\n  brings in a considerable wealth to the craftsmen that have set up\r\n  selling these tales from their refined presses, which makes religious\r\n  disputes and new occurrences subjects of detail.\r\n\r\n  “We publish these lines, and refuse for a considerable time to publish\r\n  any more. We give them gratis, because the Lord hath given to us; not\r\n  that which is the form of others, but of our own that we may rejoice\r\n  in his favours, and envy not. Our form or ceremony is not in\r\n  contradiction to any religious creed, and will therefore admit of no\r\n  dispute; and with us, we intend that religious arguments shall come to\r\n  a close.\r\n\r\n  “The Son of God hath plainly shown us how we shall gain admittance to\r\n  the blessed purposes of the creation, for this is the kingdom prepared\r\n  from the foundation of the world.\r\n\r\n  “We have built a house for the purpose of offering to God Israelite\r\n  fashion; we purpose to commence the last Saturday in October, at\r\n  twelve o’clock, and continue to offer to God for the purposes\r\n  contained in the text, once in the month throughout the year, and so\r\n  on successively until the year we die, leaving this example and\r\n  precept to our children always; this we perform without the direction\r\n  of a priest, or any officer in the church, for we are brethren.\r\n\r\n  “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed\r\n  of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation\r\n  of the world. Then he begins to justify, showing cause of mercy and of\r\n  favour; (and when the harvest is ripe, and the wheat shall be\r\n  gathered, and the tares burned;) I was hungry and ye gave me meat;\r\n  here is the power and glory of religion, here teaching comes to an\r\n  end. Can a priest preach to a man, when his heart is to do the deeds\r\n  justified of God? As a doctor to a man in good health, so is a literal\r\n  teacher to these. I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; various favours\r\n  continue from the human mind, throughout all the excellent deeds\r\n  contained in the text; the whole amount is this; Loving God, and the\r\n  salvation of the world. (We have no written creed, and therefore we\r\n  have no image to quarrel about, or literal rule to argue for, we are\r\n  against nobody, but for all.) The answer of these souls shall be this,\r\n  When saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee; or thirsty, and gave thee\r\n  drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in; or naked, and\r\n  clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto\r\n  thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto\r\n  you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my\r\n  brethren, ye have done it unto me.\r\n\r\n  “I now leave the text, and turn to the practice of life, to show cause\r\n  for a change of system; and we are required to give a reason for the\r\n  hope that we possess. The priests are as despotic in their several\r\n  congregations, as the potentates of the age; not all, I should say. I\r\n  will say that all are above their brethren, and press subordination to\r\n  their written creed, or line of doctrine. If a stranger comes to him\r\n  of another creed, will he take him in as himself, or one of his\r\n  religious kinsfolk? No; like the Almighty setting bounds to the sea,\r\n  hereunto thou mayest come, but here thy freedom and thy liberty shall\r\n  be stayed. As for me, I am numbered with the impostors, and am so\r\n  contented with the name, I forgive all my accusers; but tell them how\r\n  they use their creed, brethren, who can equally prove themselves as\r\n  right as they are. How do we of the latter named class use each other?\r\n  I confess upon an equal plan. You sell each other’s failings for\r\n  money, through the means of the press, and electioneering converts by\r\n  public arguments, and send them round sea and land to proselyte the\r\n  world. And what are they when they are gained? We will impartially own\r\n  the good with the evil. It puts away some rough and profane language,\r\n  and some extreme immorality, a work glorious in its place. Do we not\r\n  teach them to pray? To an extreme, but not how to receive. Do we not\r\n  teach them the way to embrace society? Yes, a hundred ways. Christ\r\n  said, I am the way, and that way through preaching is perhaps divided\r\n  into a hundred parts; the number of sects in the Christian name, I\r\n  know not; but I know that priestcraft hath done this, and with us it\r\n  is coming to an end. It is not the one way, Christ the hope of glory,\r\n  that hath divided the whole world, and produced vain argument to such\r\n  an unlimited degree as it is now extended, from priest, pulpit, and\r\n  press, and it is chiefly sold to the poor inhabitants of the world.\r\n  And some extol themselves to be of high value, for they take shameful\r\n  sums for doctrine, and the divines are more extravagant than the\r\n  apothecaries. But a man cannot have soul or body mended now, but at\r\n  dear cost. In the days of Israel, productions of this kind were\r\n  cheaper, in the days of Christ, without money or price; a happy day\r\n  for poor souls when Christ preached the gospel to the poor, and healed\r\n  the sick without cost. The text suffers no man to go in distress, and\r\n  binds us to use lawyers, doctors, and priests well; when we see them\r\n  hungry, give them meat; if thirsty, drink; if naked, clothing; if they\r\n  are in a strange place, show friendship, take them in, they are our\r\n  brethren; if they are sick or imprisoned, go to them, they cannot come\r\n  to us; and as we use this part of the creation, so do by all other\r\n  classes, for they are our brethren; if we do it to the least of these\r\n  that hope for salvation in Christ, we do it unto him, for this hope is\r\n  the gift of God; and him that practises, doeth the will of God, the\r\n  same is my mother, my sister, and my brother. Do the sects use each\r\n  other as brethren, or doth not the priest use the common people, in\r\n  many instances, as his footstool? Amongst the liberal kind, they only\r\n  take the liberty of sect abusing sect, and priests liberally\r\n  quarrelling with each other, which hath been operating in penmanship,\r\n  ever since the dark ages of the world, that succeeded the apostles.\r\n  Can you tell me, contending priests, how many quarrels will make a\r\n  millennium? If you cannot, quarrel no more; for common people are\r\n  laughing at such barter as this; selling priests’ quarrels at the\r\n  printer’s office; dividing the world into unnumbered parts; and by\r\n  example and precept, inviting divided proselytes to follow you; this\r\n  is the practice of sects. But there is a practice between the priest\r\n  and his brethren I think worthy of note, for the information of those\r\n  more ignorant than ourselves in our home capacity, if it is possible\r\n  that any such there be.\r\n\r\n  “The priest gets on a stool or pulpit, and preaches over what is\r\n  already spoken, which is well done, and cannot be bettered. The\r\n  potters prepare men for this purpose, take them in, passive as clay,\r\n  and make of them what they will. It is far from me to speak against\r\n  learned men; but rather note a little of the principle by which\r\n  education is used. Literal education is no distinguishing mark of an\r\n  apostle, for or against the service of God. Why, then, are learned men\r\n  so highly extolled above their brethren, and sold at the highest price\r\n  at market, like the best beef? The son of God equalizes, and owns all\r\n  equally his brethren, that are for God and his righteousness. But some\r\n  classes are taught by these self-thinking superior qualities, that an\r\n  unlearned man should not be heard; if he comes to their house, the\r\n  sentence is this, Be off with the goats, on the left hand; ye are fit\r\n  for nothing, but to be convicted for ignorance; but ourselves for\r\n  learning and office, are worthy of thousands a-year for preaching\r\n  scripture creeds to the people. Poor people! little is obtained for\r\n  your money, for you are not taught that equalization is man’s right,\r\n  and that the poor are the heirs of the tribute in a Christian Church.\r\n  Christ united Jew and Samaritan, and remnants of every kind to\r\n  himself, and gave them the name of brethren; he is the pillar of a\r\n  glorious Millennium. And when priestcraft is fulfilled, and God hath\r\n  said it shall come no farther, it will come to pass. The priest is\r\n  heir of the big sum—other church officers of less, whether according\r\n  to their righteousness, what they do, or what proportion of learning\r\n  it takes to fulfil their respective offices, I do not know; but this I\r\n  know, the high priest first puts his head in the purse, for he is a\r\n  general of an army, and holds subordinate titles under him, like\r\n  military order, not equalizing his brother with himself, but a step\r\n  lower on the righteous stairs that reach from earth to heaven (like\r\n  Jacob’s ladder), he holds the chief power of putting in and putting\r\n  out of office—of calling one a sheep, and another a goat—taking in and\r\n  casting out of the church. This last prerogative descends quite down\r\n  to the foot of the stairs, and they have got the world divided indeed;\r\n  and one priest will call his neighbour’s sheep goats, and keep them on\r\n  his left hand, because his creed is not written in their foreheads.\r\n  But there is another dark class called sinners, and they are not fit\r\n  for any body’s building materials, and have no mark upon them but the\r\n  black mark, unworthy or uninformed. I belong to these, and I am\r\n  resolved never to wear a priest’s creed on my forehead; for if I do, I\r\n  am sure I will despise my neighbour or brother, and will not account\r\n  him equal with myself. I am on the goat side of the question—the\r\n  priests have put me there; but I mean to prove that such judges as\r\n  ours may be in error, for these that some call goats, others call\r\n  sheep. This judgment cannot be correct, and wants amendment. Christ\r\n  hath passed the sentence, and it needs no alteration, and the priests\r\n  need not preach any more about the matter.\r\n\r\n  “If men are generous, hospitable, and kind to all people in necessity,\r\n  the Son of God hath justified them; he hath taken away their selfish\r\n  and proud heart, and given them a generous one, equally wishing\r\n  salvation to all the world, dividing their crumbs equally to those\r\n  that stand in need. This is the glory of God, and power of religion.\r\n  Where is the priest’s office here? The Son of God saw it would come to\r\n  an end, when the hearers were preached or converted into the practice\r\n  of the text.\r\n\r\n  “We have built a house to sacrifice to God, feed the hungry, and\r\n  clothe the naked. Any stranger may come in and sacrifice with us,\r\n  without giving us money or price. It is for the various purposes of\r\n  God’s glory, the end of doctrine, and the perfection of the world. We\r\n  are not perfect; but the system adopted by us is justified of God in\r\n  Scripture, and draws the soul near unto God and Christ. It is beyond\r\n  all creeds and sectarian plans, and is with us the end of craft. We\r\n  lament the divisions of the world, and the pride of the people, the\r\n  superiority professed by priests, and the tribute paid to them.\r\n  Therefore, in adopting this plan, we expect to employ them no more.\r\n\r\n                                                         “DAVID WILLSON.\r\n\r\n  “We now commence a building of a different structure, and for a\r\n  different purpose from the other. We hold that doctrine is good for\r\n  the soul, as the physician is for the sick; but the above-written\r\n  purpose is the end, when the soul is restored from selfish delights\r\n  and purposes, and prefers the will of God before his own, he is as the\r\n  patient healed. But this doth not constitute him to be an idle\r\n  creature the rest of his days. What shall he do? Do as the sick man\r\n  healed of God; devote his strength to praise, vocal and instrumental,\r\n  that the harp of David, and the hymn sung by the apostles, may be\r\n  united together. He shall not be idle with his hands, nor still with\r\n  his feet; he shall not be redeemed from hearing the widow cry, or her\r\n  offspring mourn; his eyes shall not be closed from seeing the hungry\r\n  naked soul; he will take his burden upon him, and lighten his grief;\r\n  he shall till the field, or improve the mechanic’s shop, and the widow\r\n  and the fatherless shall rejoice in the works of his hands; and his\r\n  soul shall rejoice before the Lord, because he shall dwell with\r\n  Christ; for he hath said unto this description of people, Come, ye are\r\n  blessed of God. This is riches indeed, of which we have reason to\r\n  believe that very few high-priests enjoy; for they bear away the\r\n  widow’s crumbs, and deprive their offspring of a garment. They are so\r\n  greedy and selfish, the world mourns under the burden of these\r\n  practices, and the very earth groans for relief.\r\n\r\n  “As for the purpose of our contemplated building, it is to prepare the\r\n  heart for such a mansion as we have already. And as for our public\r\n  friend, he is growing old, and seems hastily preparing to die, and he\r\n  has enabled us in the hand of God to see as we saw not, and to\r\n  liberate our hands from priests’ wages, lawyers’ fees, and the judge’s\r\n  sentence at court. He will give way for nothing but civil power; to\r\n  such we esteem him as a true subject, and not of the alien kind.\r\n  Church matters with him are voluntary; he is bound to none, and\r\n  refuses the control of creed or priest in the service of God. We\r\n  rejoice in his labours; they make glad the heart for the exhibiting of\r\n  such liberal and generous doctrines as hath so far liberated our hands\r\n  and feet from a kind of veiled Christian slavery. We build a house\r\n  where we intend they may be handed down after his death to our\r\n  children, and the succeeding ages of the world. We covet craftsmen no\r\n  more. Our adviser prefers his brethren before himself, and will not\r\n  enter the peaceable mansion with us where we sacrifice to God. He\r\n  saith he hath sacrificed his own interest, and received the liberal\r\n  abuse of the sects, and gave up his family to provide for themselves.\r\n  He tells us that the priest’s office is below ours, and that he, by\r\n  appointment, is not worthy of that title that is justified of God; for\r\n  you observe in the text, that a priest is not set above his\r\n  fellows—that justification belongeth to brethren, those that love God\r\n  and the salvation of the world. We cannot persuade his feet to enter\r\n  there. He saith his eyes are forbidden to see the quiet place, but his\r\n  children and his grandchildren may see it after him. He hath given us\r\n  exact orders to perform by, and put a new song in our lips. We esteem\r\n  him as a brother indeed, but he is not always used as such amongst us,\r\n  but that amounts to our shame, and not his. His works, we trust,\r\n  through the blessing of God, will speak for him for ever.\r\n\r\n  “We purpose not to open our present building but once in a month,\r\n  commencing the last Saturday in October, and so on in succession, as\r\n  time and God may permit. We refuse to open to every visitor. We are\r\n  not indebted to the public for money, nor Parliament for ground; and a\r\n  little dust on the floor from the feet, and a dry compliment for\r\n  turning the key, will not pay the cost of leaving our labour—the work\r\n  of our hands are for better purposes than these. If far distant\r\n  strangers should come unto us, we may open unto them, and all our\r\n  neighbours and friends once in a month. We think ourselves done with\r\n  the sectarian plan of worship—rather the principle than the plan. We\r\n  think that no priest can preach us to a better end than the purposes\r\n  of our present house, and that no doctrine can lead us to better\r\n  purposes than these. Therefore, we embrace our own, and set the\r\n  dividing plan, of converting into a hundred divisions, free, and give\r\n  this testimony to the world, that if our testimony in public doctrines\r\n  is unworthy, not to suffer them into your houses, for we do not covet\r\n  that yours should be offered unto us.\r\n\r\n  “Signed on behalf of the brethren by\r\n\r\n                                                        “MURDOCH M‘LEOD.\r\n                                                        “JOHN DOAN.\r\n                                                        “EBENEZER DOAN.”\r\n\r\nAfter perusing such a production, many will wonder at the number and\r\nprosperity of David Willson’s flock, and the influence he has attained,\r\nwhich results from shrewdness, and not genius.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Hope, we proceeded north to Lake Simcoe, and returned by\r\nanother road to Newmarket, being engaged to dine in the neighbourhood\r\nwith Mr H——, who once farmed in the north of England, and has been\r\nseveral years in his present farm, which he rents. He manages 120 acres\r\nof cleared land, free from stumps, and none of it in pasturage, with two\r\nhorses and two oxen. The potatoes and turnips were drilled, and howed in\r\ngood style. Cattle and sheep are fatted, and, in common with those in\r\nalmost all parts of America, get salt once a-week. Labourers can be had\r\nat all times, getting $10 a-month in summer—$5 in winter. Thrashing with\r\nthe flail, one-ninth of the quantity; carriage, or teaming, from\r\nNewmarket to York, 7½d., Halifax currency, per bushel.\r\n\r\nTimber around Newmarket is of the largest size, and the expense of\r\nobtaining the first wheat crop was stated by Mr H—— thus—\r\n\r\n             Purchase money of wood land,               $ 3\r\n             Under bushing and chopping,                  8\r\n             Logging, burning, and fencing,               8\r\n             Seed and harrowing,                          3\r\n             Carting and harvesting,                      2\r\n             Thrashing and teaming,                       5\r\n                                                        ———\r\n                                                        $29\r\n                 Produce estimated at 25 bushels, at $1=$25\r\n\r\nThe country from York to Lake Simcoe is, generally, well cleared and\r\nsettled, the soil being chiefly loam, carrying excellent wheat crops,\r\nand seems fitted for almost any kind of husbandry. It is difficult to\r\nclassify the soil around Newmarket, which seemed well fitted for turnip\r\ngrowing, and such as would be considered of too soft a texture in the\r\nplace of my nativity, yet it was producing wheat crops, with stiff straw\r\nand large ears. The farm-houses seem comfortable, and the stumps are\r\nchiefly removed. The surface is undulating, and free from stagnant\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, we saw small flocks of wood-pigeons, collected after\r\nthe breeding season, and people shooting them.\r\n\r\nThe bar-room of the Newmarket hotel was filled with drunkards of the\r\nlowest class, part of them in rags, and swearing in a disgusting manner.\r\nBefore the arrival of the coach which carried us to York, we examined a\r\nlarge flour mill, and many samples of wheat it contained, not all of\r\nfine quality, and partly much sprouted. There were handsome iron\r\nploughs, made by George Gray, Uddingstone, Ayrshire, Scotland, selling\r\nat $30, while wooden ones, of Canadian make, were $18. I observed a lime\r\nkiln, formed in a bank of clay, by excavation, without building\r\nmaterials, and which seemed to have been used for some time.\r\n\r\nOur luggage, which Mr Chrystler, the landlord of the Pavilion house at\r\nNiagara falls, assured us had been despatched for York before we left\r\nhis house on the 3d July, had not reached its destination, and not\r\nhaving received an answer to a letter written to him on the subject, I\r\nresolved to enquire personally. Next morning I got on board the\r\nsteam-boat, King William the Fourth, for Niagara.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, when sailing up Lake Ontario, is uninteresting. Dark\r\ncoloured monotonous forests fringe the low shore, on which, at different\r\nintervals, are the meanest habitations of civilized men; and now and\r\nthen a puny vessel, with dirty sails, appears in view. On approaching\r\nHamilton, the landscape is more varied from the heights and little lake,\r\ntwelve miles in circumference, on which the village is situated, and\r\ndivided from the main lake by a stripe of land eighty yards wide,\r\nthrough which there is a canal lined with wood. When going through the\r\ncanal, the rope passing from the helm to the wheel in the forecastle,\r\nwhere the pilot of all American steamers takes his station, gave way,\r\nand the vessel narrowly escaped destruction. Six hours were spent in\r\nlanding and shipping merchandise at Hamilton on Sunday. Many of the\r\nsteerage passengers were tipsy, and some quarrelling. I walked into the\r\nwoods to escape the scene. The stillness of a Scotch Sabbath is better\r\nappreciated after sojourning in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nThe steamer reached Niagara at ten o’clock. At four next morning I\r\nproceeded in an extra to the falls, which were visited before breakfast.\r\nMr Chrystler assured me the luggage had been despatched as stated at the\r\ntime; and on my return I discovered it in the lobby of a hotel at the\r\nvillage of Niagara, where it had arrived from the Pavilion house the\r\nnight before. At noon I got on board the daily steamer for York. The day\r\nwas so cold that people clothed themselves in great-coats in crossing\r\nthe lake, and many became sick from the agitation of the waters.\r\n\r\nOn 14th July I found some wheat crops near Niagara almost ripe, the\r\ncherry-trees stript of fruit, and the graceful blossom of the sweet\r\nchestnut fading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from York to Coburg—Mail Waggon—Mr Somerville—Agricultural\r\n    Notices—Clay Kneading—Female Helps seating themselves\r\n    at Table—Port Hope—Coburg—Agricultural Notices—Fast\r\n    Eating—Excursion to Peterborough—School-fellow—Peterborough—Rice\r\n    Lake—Notices of Nature and Agriculture—Settlers—High Price of\r\n    Land—Injudicious Settlement—Bay of Quinte—Indian Settlement—Canada\r\n    Thistle—Kingston—Storekeepers and Store-pay—Grasshoppers—Lake of the\r\n    Thousand Isles—River St Lawrence._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend D—— and I left York at 5 P.M., on 16th July, by the Kingston\r\nmail, an open waggon, drawn by two horses, and reached Windsor, a\r\ndistance of twenty-nine miles, at two in the morning. The roads were\r\nworse than any yet travelled on, and a driver stopped two hours at a\r\nhotel notwithstanding our anxiety to get him away.\r\n\r\nThe soil, for ten miles down the margin of the lake, is poor sand,\r\ncovered with pines, until passing some ridges, where there are good\r\nfarms; here night shut out the face of nature.\r\n\r\nFrom Windsor, in the township of Whitby, we set out on foot, after\r\nbreakfast, to visit Mr W——, to whom we had a letter, and found him\r\nsuffering under ague at Mr Somerville’s. I was anxious to see Mr\r\nSomerville, from having heard his letter, which appeared sometime before\r\nin the _Edinburgh Quarterly Journal of Agriculture_, censured by my\r\nlately-imported countrymen, and his establishment and prospects\r\nridiculed. He received us kindly, and after walking over the farm, we\r\nreturned in time for an early dinner.\r\n\r\nOn entering the house it was necessary to go one by one, as the door\r\nopened so as to close up the passage leading to the kitchen, through\r\nwhich we entered to the sitting-room, where we dined. Both apartments\r\nwere small, clean, and crowded with old-country furniture. The house was\r\na log one, but a better was soon to be built. The dinner consisted of\r\nfried pork, the standard dish of the country, eggs, new potatoes, and\r\npancakes. Homely as the fare may be considered, it has seldom been my\r\nfate to rise from table more gratified with a repast, each dish being\r\nexcellent in its kind, and the entertainment seasoned with the good\r\nsense, contentment, and manly feeling, of our host. Miss Somerville,\r\nlike all my countrywomen met in Canada, was active and in good spirits;\r\nbut her piano had remained untouched in the corner of the room since her\r\narrival in the country, the churn being now her favourite instrument.\r\n\r\nMr Somerville told me his letter was not written with a view to\r\npublication, and it appeared in the Quarterly Journal without his\r\nknowledge. Under these circumstances it would perhaps be unreasonable to\r\nhold him responsible for its contents. Not having read the letter since\r\nthe time of publication, I cannot say if it is a just representation of\r\nhis situation, but I can testify to the good quality of his soil, which\r\nhe says no visitor ever examined minutely but myself. His pasture-grass\r\nwas truly excellent; wheat and oats of medium quality; potatoes and\r\nIndian corn well cultivated, and promising crops. He had let twenty\r\nacres of forest land to clear and fence, at $12 per acre, which he says\r\nis the common cash price of the country. Labourers have difficulty in\r\ngetting employment during winter; and on the morning of our arrival Mr\r\nSomerville engaged a first-rate hand for his aguish friend at $80 per\r\nannum, and ordinary people may be had for $72; wages paid in cash. Boys\r\nfit for farm work, and women servants, get $4 a-month. Farms in the\r\ntownship, two-thirds cleared, with suitable buildings, may be had for\r\n$12 cash, and $16 credit. Bricks are $5 per thousand.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Whitby is rich, and not much inferior to that around\r\nNewmarket, being free loam, and occasionally approaching to sand. The\r\nvegetable mould in Mr Somerville’s forest was five inches deep.\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner we joined a waggon, by appointment, on the\r\nCoburg road, and by which we travelled to the Darlington hotel in the\r\nvillage of Bowmanville, passing over a poor sandy soil, of which the\r\ntownship of Darlington seems to consist.\r\n\r\nOn our journey we saw two oxen employed in walking round a pit, kneading\r\nclay for brick-making, which appeared cruelty, and wasteful of animal\r\nlabour, the poor animals walking up to the bellies in mud, with erect\r\ntails and extended tongues. The common mode of preparing clay being with\r\na tree drawn by a horse or ox round a pivot, the lopped branches\r\nkneading the clay. An elm-tree, twenty feet in height, was growing from\r\nthe heart of one of rotten button-wood, ten feet from the ground. A\r\nplantation of hops, in Whitby, was luxuriant and healthy.\r\n\r\nOn stepping out of the waggon at Bowmanville, we walked over a farm\r\nwhich I had been requested to value for a friend, and we sprung a\r\nwoodcock in a wheat-field, a bird that is said to breed regularly in the\r\ndistrict. Woodpeckers, robins, and blackbirds, of the country, were\r\ndevouring cherries so greedily, that a gun was fired at them to little\r\npurpose every five minutes. Two wrens were seen in Whitby similar to\r\nthose of Britain.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and Canada tea and coffee are not prepared or\r\npoured out by travellers, but by the landlady or a female help. In no\r\npart of the United States did a female help, at a hotel, seat herself\r\nduring meals; and I observed the practice only upon one occasion in a\r\nprivate house. The maid-servant at Bowmanville seated herself during tea\r\nin a corner of the room, and the like occurrence took place at Newmarket\r\nduring supper. In Britain servants stand while assisting at table, and\r\nthey also do so in Canada; the difference of attitude taking place when\r\ntheir services are not required. For my own part, I would much rather\r\nsee a young waiting-maid seated, when not required, than standing\r\nperhaps painfully erect; and, in many instances, when taking tea or\r\ncoffee, during my tour, I put it in the option of the helps to leave the\r\nroom, which they generally did. There seems no general rule for\r\nattitude, as inferring respect. In some countries attendants almost\r\nhumble themselves in the dust in presence of employers, and in others\r\nthey are required to carry themselves erect.\r\n\r\nWe left Bowmanville at seven in the morning, by the mail-stage, which\r\nhad taken fourteen hours to come forty-three miles; and my friend left\r\nmy only thermometer at the door of the hotel. A few miles from Port Hope\r\nour waggon was changed for a small neat coach, which we found an\r\nagreeable alteration, and soon reached Coburg.\r\n\r\nPort Hope is prettily situated near Lake Ontario, at the mouth of a\r\nsmall stream, murmuring over a rocky bottom, and well calculated for\r\npropelling machinery. There is a pier, and general appearances betoken\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nCoburg is also situated near Lake Ontario, and much larger and more\r\nadvanced than Port Hope. It has much trade with the country across Rice\r\nLake.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable extent of cleared ground from Bowmanville to\r\nPort Hope; the soil poor and ill managed. Near the latter it improves,\r\nand towards Coburg are some good farm-houses and offices, around which\r\nthe fields are well cultivated and fenced.\r\n\r\nAround Coburg the vegetable mould in the woods was three inches deep,\r\nand the soil sandy loam. The greater part of the soil we have seen in\r\nAmerica is of soft texture, and easily laboured. Here we learned plough\r\nirons are only repaired twice a-year. At Newmarket a plough was pointed\r\nout, the irons of which had not been at the smithy since the previous\r\nOctober, and were still in tolerable order. Mildew was seen on wheat at\r\nBowmanville and Coburg. A lime-kiln was preparing building-lime on the\r\nshores of the lake, and stones of the same rock were quarried for\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nWe found the young men swallowing their food at the table of the hotel\r\nas fast as those of Albany did. It is almost a universal practice in the\r\nStates and Canada to board men, such as clerks and shopmen, in hotels. A\r\nlarge bell or horn is sounded half an hour before meals, and again when\r\nserved up. Hence the rush to table, and expeditious eating.\r\n\r\nNext morning we set out in a waggon for Sully on Rice Lake, a steamer\r\ncarrying us across the lake and up the river Otanabee to Peterborough,\r\nthe head of navigation, where we found accommodation at Macfadden’s\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nWhen about to sit down to breakfast, I was introduced to Colonel B——, a\r\nScotchman, who, when seated at table, stated he was from East Lothian.\r\nKnowing almost every individual in the district, I said in a tone of\r\nsurprise, “Are you serious?” and scanned his features very closely.\r\nAnswering in the affirmative, I asked if his name was Robert, if he had\r\na brother, and immediately introduced myself as a class-fellow at the\r\nschool of Haddington in 1806, not having since met or perhaps heard of\r\neach other. We talked over old stories, and I was delighted to find my\r\nfriend possessed of one of the neatest and most comfortable cottages in\r\nthe finest situation in Peterborough.\r\n\r\nPeterborough is on the Otanabee, and likely to become a place of some\r\nimportance. At present there are a number of mean houses scattered over\r\na considerable extent of surface, and the population is stated at 1000\r\nsouls, although I would not have rated them near so high. It is said to\r\ncontain a number of military and naval half-pay officers of Britain, and\r\nthe society to be the most polished and aristocratic in Canada.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon we walked up the left bank of the river to visit Mr T——,\r\nwhom we met by the way, accompanied by his lady, who continued her\r\njourney on horseback, and he returned with us. In the evening we walked\r\nup the river side, passing an excellent mill-site, on which grist and\r\nsaw-mills were being erected, until we reached a string of lakes,\r\nthrough which the Otanabee flows. The road up the banks of the river was\r\njust opening, the trees had not been felled the length of Mr T——’s, and\r\nin our evening walk some parts of the tract could only be crossed by\r\nleaping, like squirrels, from trunk to trunk of fallen trees. On one\r\noccasion my friend D——’s feet slipped, and he fell on his face, with\r\nboth arms fixed in the mud.\r\n\r\nWe left Peterborough for Coburg on 22d July, by way of Rice Lake, and\r\nremarked that two-thirds of the people seen on the road were tipsy. This\r\nwas a painful sight, which the heat of the weather did not soften or\r\njustify.\r\n\r\nRice Lake takes its name from the quantity of rice floating on its\r\nwaters; it is surrounded by gentle rising banks, and contains several\r\nsmall islands. The lake is formed by the waters of the Otanabee, which,\r\nfrom the lake to within a short distance of Peterborough, forms an\r\nuninteresting sail, being a dense forest on both sides, with three or\r\nfour log-huts in the course of sixteen miles. Above the rapids, at\r\nPeterborough, the river runs with considerable impetuosity, the banks\r\nbecome diversified, in size equalling the largest river in Britain, and\r\nits water-power, if properly developed, of considerable magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe surface, from Coburg to Rice Lake, is highly undulating, and, if\r\ncleared, would perhaps be picturesque; the soil gradually falling off,\r\nbecoming poor sand, with timber of inferior size, and all kinds of crops\r\nbad. For miles, before reaching the lake, the road leads through thinly\r\nscattered oak trees, called plaines, or oak openings, covered with\r\nstunted underwood, with external indications of extreme sterility; but\r\nfarther experience enables me to say, the appearance of the plaines is\r\nnot owing to quality of soil, but to the herbage being annually burned.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Otanabee, and on the banks of the lake, is a\r\nconsiderable clearance formed by government for the Massagur tribe of\r\nIndians, and called Indian Village, adjoining which is the residence of\r\nCaptain Anderson, prettily situated.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the small clearances on the Otanabee, above Peterborough is\r\nnot of very fine quality, and mingled with large stones, but seemed to\r\nimprove on receding from the river. On cleared ground there was scarcely\r\na plant of clover, or even of grass, with the exception of timothy, the\r\nseed of which had been sown. At the time of visiting this district I was\r\ninclined to think unfavourably of the soil from the want of clovers and\r\ngrasses, but extended observation convinced me this circumstance had no\r\nconnexion with the quality of soil, and would not operate unfavourably\r\nagainst the prosperity of these plants when their seeds are sown.\r\n\r\nNear the banks of the Otanabee, a dark-coloured caterpillar had devoured\r\nsome fields of timothy grass, with exception of the culms, and the\r\ninsect had extended its ravages partially to Indian corn and wheat, but\r\nred clover was untouched, growing amongst timothy which had been\r\nentirely consumed. I could learn nothing of its natural history; but its\r\nattacks were said to have been felt in 1825; and accounts from distant\r\nparts of the north spoke of its attacks this year as highly destructive.\r\n\r\nWhile delayed at Sully I strolled into the forest, and, on the margin of\r\nRice Lake, found a solitary plant of red clover, having about fifty\r\nflower-stalks from one root, measuring five feet in height, and neither\r\nsoil or situation seemed favourable to luxuriance. There were three\r\nheads faded, which I collected, and afterwards lost to my regret. On the\r\nplains there were many flowering plants and grasses, and I remarked\r\n_triticum repens_, the thick-rooted couch-grass of Britain, which is\r\nfound over many parts of Canada. Gooseberries covered with strong\r\nprickles, which soften as the fruit ripens; and black currants, with\r\nprickly and unprickly fruit, were growing in the woods; and hazel loaded\r\nwith nuts on open places.\r\n\r\nWages of farm-labourers in the neighbourhood of Peterborough were stated\r\nat $10 per month by the year, and at $12 in part of summer. A\r\nrespectable settler in Smithstown told me he had offered $115 in cash\r\nper annum, to be paid when a crop was reaped from the labour. In all\r\ncases produce or store pay seems to be given, unless by special\r\nagreement to the contrary. Cash is a scarce commodity, and could not be\r\nobtained for wheat at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn course of my short excursion I had seen some bush life of individuals\r\nformerly moving in a higher grade than those on the Welland canal. The\r\ngeneral impression was not favourable, and after farther experience of\r\nsuch life, many things appeared exceptionable. In particular, ardent\r\nspirits were too frequently used, mingled it is true with water, which\r\nperhaps did not mitigate their effects. A cask of spirits, with a crane,\r\noften stood in the corner of the room, and Mr D——r informed me Mr —— had\r\na bee a few weeks before, which lasted two days, and at which eighty\r\ngallons of spirits were consumed.\r\n\r\nThe Newcastle district has been a fashionable place of settlement of\r\nlate years, more especially around Peterborough; and I was soon aware of\r\nthe means taken to induce people to settle in it. Before leaving\r\nScotland I had seen a catalogue of a most extensive sale of land\r\n_purporting_ to take place in course of summer, and which contained a\r\nchart of the district in which the lands lay. The chart formed our only\r\nmap, and was studded with villages, &c. In particular, Gambletown was\r\nmarked on the chart with numerous houses, as if a place of considerable\r\nsize; and on sailing up the Otanabee, on which it is situated, I\r\nexpected a thriving village; but on stopping to obtain a supply of\r\nfirewood, what was my disappointment at only finding two log-huts, one\r\nof which was unoccupied! Accounts of the value of land appear\r\nexaggerated. Uncleared forest land had, it was said, been sold at some\r\ndistance from Peterborough at $8 per acre, and some people wished me to\r\nbelieve all land bore a relative value. A gentleman estimated his\r\nproperty at $20 per acre, while I was offered the adjoining back lot of\r\nbetter soil at $6, and I have no doubt could have got it for $4 cash. A\r\nproperty has been said to yield annually L.500, which is very near the\r\nsum I valued it at in perpetuity after examination.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 23d we left Coburg for Carrying-place on the bay\r\nof Quinte, which we reached before dusk, having passed over an\r\nundulating surface, the soil of which, with exception of part near\r\nCarrying-place, was sandy and stony. Crops of all kinds inferior. A\r\nfield of rye had been cradled, and one of wheat was sufficiently matured\r\nfor the operation. This line of road illustrated the evils arising from\r\nwant of knowledge of soils in new settlers. Much of the soil was drift\r\nsand, and would not repay the expenses of cultivation, cheap as those in\r\nCanada are. Several farms seemed to have been deserted after having been\r\nsome years occupied; and unacquaintance with land, and other parts of\r\nthe American continent, can alone account for human beings having wasted\r\ntheir labour in clearing such unfruitful soil.\r\n\r\nNext morning we left Carrying-place at four for Kingston, where we\r\narrived at nine P. M., having passed Trent, Belville, Sophiaburgh,\r\nHallowell, and Bath.\r\n\r\nThe bay of Quinte is a branch of Lake Ontario, and a sail on its waters\r\nperhaps imparts as much pleasure as any in Canada. Numberless islands,\r\nbays, and promontories of every size, shape, and aspect, together with\r\never-varying shades of vegetation, delight the eye. In many places the\r\nmargins are low, but for miles, on both sides of Hallowell, the banks\r\nare of considerable height, well clothed with wood and adorned with\r\nhouses. In the distance was an island with a considerable sized Indian\r\nvillage, said to contain 600 souls. The white-washed cots had a fine\r\neffect in passing down the bay, while the inhabitants fishing in their\r\nfragile canoes, and gliding to and fro on the unruffled waters, added\r\ninterest to the scene. On the mainland, opposite to the island, is an\r\nIndian reserve, on which is a church, lonely situated near the margin of\r\nthe bay, and very unlike the worshipping places of more civilized men.\r\nBut the half-naked Indian, in recesses of the forest, may offer homage\r\nto the Author of the Universe, with as much sincerity and hope of\r\nacceptance, as the purple-clad in the glittering temples of the city.\r\n\r\nThe shores of the bay of Quinte have long been settled, and a\r\nconsiderable extent of surface freed of wood. Wheat appeared nearly\r\nripe, and in a few instances cradling had commenced. Crops were inferior\r\nand crowded with thistles, apparently the common perennial way-thistle\r\nof Britain. My friend D—— and I, walking on deck, remarked a field\r\nbearing a dense-looking crop with purple coloured flowers, which one\r\npronounced clover, the other pease, but on nearer approach it was seen\r\nto be pasturage intermixed with thistles. This was an unfortunate\r\nmistake for those having some pretensions to a knowledge of practical\r\nagriculture, and perhaps the thistle-grower may esteem our discernment\r\nas lightly as we do his management. This species of thistle is known in\r\nthe States by the name of the Canada thistle, and some proposals have\r\nbeen made in the State of New York, to legislate to prevent its\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nKingston is finely situated on a bay of Lake Ontario, over which there\r\nis an excellent wooden bridge, perhaps the best in America, connecting\r\nthe town with the fort and naval yard. Most of the houses are of stone\r\nor brick, and the inhabitants estimated at 6000 souls. It enjoys a\r\nconsiderable trade, which is likely to be greatly augmented by the\r\nopening of the Rideau canal, which here enters the lake.\r\n\r\nWe examined the barracks, most substantial erections, also the fort and\r\nnaval yard; the former is renewing with the best materials; the vessels\r\nin the docks are hastening to decay. Regarding war in every case an\r\nevil, and its engines too often misapplied, the rotting vessels excited\r\nmore pleasing ideas than the rising fort.\r\n\r\nWe learned masons employed at the fort got $1 a-day, without finding or\r\nboard; and in town considerably more, when store pay is given. One\r\ngentleman said he would rather give $120 store-pay than $100 cash; and a\r\nworkman said he preferred $9 cash to $12 store-pay. I could not learn\r\nthat employer and storekeeper unite for the purpose of plundering\r\nworkmen. At present storekeepers constitute the most wealthy and\r\npowerful class in the community, landowners and workmen being generally\r\nindebted to them, hence enormous profits. The common per centage on\r\nretailing provisions at Kingston, being stated at 70 per cent, dry goods\r\n100. Potash sells at Montreal for L.24 a-ton; the farmer at Kingston\r\ngets L.17 store-pay, equal to L.12 cash.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Kingston grasshoppers were numerous, many of\r\nthem having wings, and flying a considerable distance. This insect is\r\nnumerous throughout America, and sometimes seriously injures grass\r\ncrops. As cultivation extends, its numbers are likely to decrease.\r\n\r\nHaving perambulated Kingston and the surrounding country, the soil of\r\nwhich was inferior, with limestone everywhere protruding, we got on\r\nboard a steam-boat for Prescott, where we arrived at midnight, and again\r\nsailed for Longsault in the Iroquois steamer, a light vessel with\r\npaddles in the stern, built for navigating the rapids of the St\r\nLawrence, and which has been found to answer well. From Longsault we\r\npassed to Cornwall by a stage, and again by a steamer to Coteau-de-lac,\r\nwhere we got into a stage to Cascades, and by steam to Lachine, and from\r\nthence by land to Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Kingston I anticipated much pleasure in sailing through the\r\nLake of the Thousand Isles, which forms the passage of Lake Ontario into\r\nthe river St Lawrence, but the curtain of night fell before we had well\r\nentered, and the light of the moon did not render objects distinct.\r\nThere was a pleasing novelty in the lake from the number of low islands\r\nlike tufts of vegetation sleeping on the surface, and glistening with\r\nthe fires of the wood-choppers. The moon’s shadow in the ripple of the\r\nwaters was particularly beautiful, and some hours might have been passed\r\npleasantly on deck but for a cold, damp atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe St Lawrence being the first river of magnitude I had sailed on, my\r\npreconceptions of its effects on the senses were quickly dispelled; the\r\nobjects on its level banks being indistinct and soon lost to the eye.\r\nThe associations suggested by the endless and ever-varying objects,\r\nsuccessively and vividly impressed on the mind’s eye in passing down a\r\nriver in Britain, are altogether wanting. Fertility, shelter, health,\r\nand peaceful retirement, so dear to a Scottish farmer, and almost\r\ninvariably the attributes of the streamlets of his country, belong not\r\nto the St Lawrence in this part of its course, where the low lying, and\r\nin many places reed-growing, margins suggest pestilence and privation.\r\nThe immensity of fresh water hurrying towards the sea fills the mind\r\nwith wonder.\r\n\r\nAround Cornwall, and more particularly from Coteau-du-Lac to the\r\nCascades, much excellent wheat was growing on clay soil formed into very\r\nnarrow ridges. Other crops were indifferent, and nearly choked with\r\nperennial thistles. From Lachine to Montreal we observed many wild oats\r\n(_Avena fatua_) for the first time in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  _Excursions around Montreal— Township of Hinchinbrooke—River\r\n    Chateauguay—Kinds of Houses—Bushmen and Farmers—Squatters—Price of\r\n    Land—Flag Staffs—Huntingdon—Isle Bourdeaux—Face of the\r\n    Country around Montreal—Farming of old Settlers—French\r\n    Canadians—Laprairie—Wheat Fly—Cheap Purchase—Chambly—Cheap\r\n    Education—Mistake Roads—Horse Ferry-boat—Starving Out—Mountain—Race\r\n    Course—State of Agriculture around Montreal—Montreal._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the town of Montreal and its neighbourhood reside several old\r\nfriends, by whom we were kindly welcomed, and in whose company we\r\nexperienced so much pleasure, that I shall ever look back on the time\r\nspent amongst them with delight. The town was soon explored, and became\r\nthe centre of several excursions to the adjoining country.\r\n\r\nOn the second day after our arrival we set out for the Township of\r\nHinchinbrooke, travelling by stage to Lachine; from thence by steam\r\nacross the St Lawrence into the river Chateauguay to the head of its\r\nnavigation, twelve miles from its mouth, where we got a stage to the\r\nvillage of Huntingdon. We dined at a hotel kept by Mrs Love, and walked\r\nup the banks of the river to the residence of Mr ——, whom we met by the\r\nway. Next forenoon was spent in walking over the farm, and after dinner\r\nwe visited Mr ——, who arrived in the country a year ago, and who was\r\nerecting a good stone house. Early next morning, Mr —— and I walked over\r\nthe country, crossing the river Hinchinbrooke, passing up Oak or Mud\r\ncreek, and down Trout river to the village of Huntingdon. Here we met,\r\nby appointment, a party of friends, and examined a farm which Mr —— had\r\nbought a few days before. Next day we travelled by stages and steam-boat\r\nto Montreal.\r\n\r\nDuring this excursion I experienced much pleasure at finding my friends\r\nand former neighbours possessing so many more old country comforts than\r\nthe backwood settlers in Upper Canada, and all enjoying good health and\r\nspirits. This is quite an East Lothian colony; four farmers who have\r\nsettled here dined with us, and there are blacksmiths, tailors, &c. &c.\r\nwithout number in the village. The township of Hinchinbrooke is a\r\nthriving settlement, and in point of climate perhaps the best in Lower\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe river Chateauguay is of small size, its banks have long been settled\r\nby French Canadians, and for twenty miles above its navigable point is\r\nalmost a continued village, the mode of French settlement being to place\r\nhouses on each side of a road or street, with narrow parallel portions\r\nof land attached to each, extending a mile or two back. The farms are\r\ngenerally free of wood, and the banks of the river, consequently,\r\nwithout beauty. Towards Huntingdon there are few French settlers, and\r\nabove the village the banks are wooded, and some good farms are seen.\r\nHere the Chateauguay is joined by the Hinchinbrooke, Trout river, and\r\nOak creek, the banks of all of which are settled, and abound with good\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the banks of the river occupied by the French is strong\r\nclay, bearing alternately wheat and thistle pastures, with occasionally\r\na few oats, big peas, and potatoes. The houses are generally brick, and\r\na few are of stone. Boys were seen playing at cricket.\r\n\r\nFor several miles below Huntingdon the soil is very inferior, but\r\nimproves in the neighbourhood of the village. On the small streams above\r\nthe village the soil embraces every description of clay, loam, and sand.\r\nThis tract has been recently settled, chiefly by British emigrants, and\r\nwhen the forest is subdued, likely to become valuable. Corn crops do not\r\noccupy much extent of ground at present. Grass was in many situations\r\nexcellent, red and white clover abounding without having been sown. In\r\ntwo instances I saw wheat crops which had been sown in autumn, and\r\nneither were good; if such a crop succeeds any where in Lower Canada, it\r\nmust be in this district. The houses consist of wood, and are log,\r\nblock, or frame, according to the wealth or taste of the owner. A\r\nlog-house consists of rough logs or unbarked trees, piled above each\r\nother, dove-tailed at the corners of the walls, and the intervals\r\nbetwixt the logs filled up with clay or other materials. A block-house\r\nis composed of logs squared so as to class on each other. A frame-house\r\nis sawn boards, nailed on a frame, with lath and plaster inside, and\r\ncorresponds with the wood barracks in Britain. There is another\r\ndescription of frame-house in Upper Canada, which has slender lath on\r\nthe outside, simply rough-cast with lime and gravel, like stone houses\r\nin Britain, with common lath and plaster inside. Houses have pitched\r\nroofs, covered with thin pieces of wood, called shingles, resembling and\r\nanswering the purposes of slate. A shanty differs from a log-house only\r\nin wanting a pitch roof, and having bark or hollow trees in place of\r\nshingles.\r\n\r\nDuring this excursion, the cause of bushmen or pioneers moving from\r\nfirst settlements to more remote parts of the forest, became obvious.\r\nThe destruction of forest, and management of cleared land, are evidently\r\ndifferent departments, the latter requiring more capital, and a higher\r\ndegree of knowledge than pioneers generally possess; and in Canadian\r\nfarming, the wood-chopper and husbandmen stand to each other in relation\r\nof mason and joiner in British house-building, the one forming a rude\r\noutline, which the other polishes, and may be instanced as illustrative\r\nof the advantages of a division of labour. In several instances I saw\r\nfamilies of first settlers possessing a considerable extent of excellent\r\ncleared land, without the knowledge or means of rendering it productive,\r\nand they certainly would benefit themselves by disposing of their\r\nproperties, and adopting another mode of life. Living almost in\r\nidleness, they cultivated, in the most negligent manner, only so much\r\nwheat and potatoes as was judged sufficient for home consumption,\r\nrelying on the hay crop for procuring what necessaries they did not\r\nthemselves produce, and appeared so encrusted with sloth, that they were\r\nlikely only to fire a gun with the view of obtaining food, and to cut\r\ndown a tree for the purpose of cooking it.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous calls I made, was one on Trout river, at the house\r\nof a Yankee squatter, who was from home. Mrs C—— was also a Yankee, a\r\ngood-looking buxom dame, with two or three young children, and a help of\r\nsmall size. She spurned the idea of assisting her husband to cut down\r\nhis wheat crop, but said she would join him in eating it—never worked in\r\nthe fields herself, and her girls should not; men must work for her\r\ngirls, she did not think females were made for working. In all\r\nprobability she was the daughter of a wood-chopper.\r\n\r\nLands in the district of Hinchinbrooke are held by English tenure, and\r\nsell moderately. A friend bought 200 acres last year, with a log and\r\nframe-house, for L.270 currency. This year another bought 300 acres,\r\nwith 90 cleared, for L.327 currency. The inhabitants did not appear so\r\nmuch addicted to ardent spirits as those of some parts in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nIn passing up the Chateauguay, many flag-staffs or poles were observed,\r\nwhich owe their origin to an old law, requiring captains of militia so\r\nto distinguish their residences. My friend Mr ——, residing near the\r\nfrontier line, was appointed captain of militia some years ago, and\r\nerected a pole in front of his house. In the States similar poles are\r\nused for hotel sign-posts. The Yankees not being aware of this old\r\ncustom, used to call at my friend’s and ask for brandy, &c. He was much\r\nannoyed by such visitors, and while deliberating one day on the mode of\r\nrestraining them, a spruce fellow walked into his parlour, and asked to\r\nbe shaved. The pole was instantly stretched on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe village of Huntingdon consists of 30 or 40 wood houses, with grist\r\nand saw mills; paper, and hat manufactory, and a post office. There is a\r\nschool, and a church was soon to be erected.\r\n\r\nOn 2d August, Mr —— and I, in his gig, friend D——, with a driver and\r\nhired calash, left Montreal, passing down the banks of the river, by\r\nLong Point to Isle Bourdeaux, situated at the confluence of the St\r\nLawrence with the north channel of the Ottawa, which forms the Island of\r\nMontreal. Isle Bourdeaux was understood to be for sale, and is one of\r\nthe most celebrated spots for situation and soil in the Lower Province.\r\nHere a place was pointed out from which clay had been dug, and burned\r\nfor manure some years ago, and which failed, as in other parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we crossed by the ferry to the opposite side of the\r\nOttawa, passing up the banks of the stream by Terre Bonne, and reached\r\nSt Therese in the morning. Early next day, we examined a property for\r\nsale, and after breakfast proceeded in a northern direction twelve or\r\nfourteen miles, and returned to St Therese. Here we changed our horses\r\nfor those brought with us the day before; and after crossing a branch of\r\nthe Ottawa by Porteous’ Bridge to the Isle of Jesus, and over a second\r\nbranch of that river to the Island of Montreal, we reached our\r\ndestination by six in the evening, having encountered several\r\nthunder-storms in the course of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country on the banks of the Ottawa, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Terre Bonne, St Therese, and from thence by St Rose and St Martin’s,\r\nto Montreal, is truly beautiful, and the softness of the scenery is in\r\nmany places heightened by the small wooded islets, encompassed by the\r\nsmooth gliding branches of the Ottawa. The scenery increases in interest\r\non approaching the mountain over which the road passes by a kind of\r\nglen, clothed with fruit and other trees. From the brow of the hill\r\npassing to the south, the majestic St Lawrence, flowing in broad expanse\r\ndown Lachine rapids, bursts on the view, and the declivity of the\r\nmountain, adorned with villas, and the city of Montreal lying at the\r\nfoot, with shining tin-roofed houses, giving it the appearance of a\r\ndistant camp, form a scene seldom equalled in America or any other part\r\nof the world. The general aspect of the country from St Therese to\r\nMontreal, closely resembles that of some of the finest parts of England.\r\n\r\nThe soil from Montreal to St Therese, a distance of nearly forty miles,\r\nby the banks of the St Lawrence and Ottawa, is strong clay, and I do not\r\nrecollect of having travelled over the like extent of continuous good\r\nwheat soil in any part of the world; but the management which it was\r\nunder is wretched in the extreme, although the crops in many parts were\r\ngood. Pasture and spring sown wheat succeed each other, year after year,\r\nalmost unaided by manures, with one ploughing previous to wheat sowing.\r\nClover seeds are never sown, yet cow grass and white clover everywhere\r\nabound, and often attain the utmost luxuriance. Heaps of manure were\r\nseen dissolving into earth on the way sides. Manure is, occasionally,\r\ndeposited thickly in heaps on pastures in the early part of summer,\r\nwhere it remains to be spread by the cattle and pigs. When manure is\r\napplied to the potato crop, which is very limited in extent, it is\r\nspread on the surface after the crop is above ground. Cattle and sheep\r\nare small, lean, miserable looking creatures, and their pastures as bare\r\nas possible. Fully one-third of the sheep are black coloured, the wool\r\nof which is useful in forming the grey cloth which almost the whole\r\nFrench population wear, and saves the expense and trouble of dyeing.\r\nNeither sheep nor cattle resemble any of the breeds I am acquainted\r\nwith, and in all probability both are descended from those of France.\r\nThe horses are small, and coarse-looking—mere ponies, though said to be\r\nactive and hardy. The fences are invariably post and rail. Wild oats\r\nwere particularly numerous in all crops.\r\n\r\nThe French Canadians, of the ordinary classes, almost invariably live in\r\nblock-houses, with large windows, and seem ill constructed, externally\r\nand internally, for economizing heat, which the nature of the climate,\r\nand scarcity of fuel, render so desirable. They have a clean appearance,\r\nbeing often white-washed with lime, and the window-boards and roofs are\r\noccasionally painted of different colours, and seldom harmonize with the\r\nhouse. A tree or shrub is never found in their gardens, and an orchard,\r\nexcept in the neighbourhood of the mountain, is almost unknown.\r\n\r\nThe wealthier French Canadians are ambitious of having stone-houses,\r\nwhich are very awkward erections, and so ill built, that my friend D——\r\nsaid the work looked as if it had been done by ploughmen between\r\nyokings.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are rather under-sized, broad-shouldered, and\r\nathletic-looking men, with swarthy complexions. They generally bowed to\r\nus in passing, and the boys invariably did so. The little creatures had\r\na most grotesque appearance, decked in very broad-brimmed straw hats,\r\nand a flowing shirt being their only covering.\r\n\r\nContemplating a tour into what are called the Eastern Townships, and\r\nwhich have since become the scene of operations of a new land company, I\r\nwas obligingly furnished with instructions and letters by Mr R. A——, who\r\nhad passed through them a few weeks before, and on whose attentions I\r\nhad not the slightest claim. We arranged to leave Montreal by the mail\r\nstage, on the afternoon of the 5th; but receiving a call from Mr ——,\r\nwhom I had met with in Scotland, and who once farmed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh, it was agreed that we should accompany him\r\nto his residence on the opposite side of the St Lawrence, and be driven\r\nin his waggon a considerable part of our route, next morning.\r\nAccordingly, we crossed to Laprairie in a steamer, at ten A.M., and\r\nproceeded on the road to St Philip’s three or four miles, till we\r\nreached Mr ——’s residence.\r\n\r\nLaprairie is a small mean-looking village, inhabited almost entirely by\r\nFrench Canadians, and deriving its chief importance from being the\r\nentrance and depôt of farm produce from the States to Montreal, and from\r\nits inhabitants enjoying the privilege of an extensive grazing common,\r\nwhich was part of the Jesuits’ confiscated property.\r\n\r\nThis part of the country differs from any we had yet visited inhabited\r\nby French Canadians, having many single trees interspersed over the\r\nsurface, and a few on creek banks. The soil is invariably clay of the\r\nstrongest texture, in bad condition, and stands much in want of\r\ndraining.\r\n\r\nIn this neighbourhood I observed wheat ears exhibiting ravages of\r\nwheat-fly, and on examination found many capsules filled with shrivelled\r\ngrains, or altogether empty. The maggots having left the ears and\r\ndescended to the earth, I was unable to determine whether this insect is\r\nidentical with the wheat-fly of Britain; but the collapsed state of the\r\nchaff presented the same appearance as the crop in East-Lothian when\r\ninjured by fly, while spider-webs on the ears contained fragments of\r\nflies resembling ichneumons. I was told the French inhabitants around St\r\nPhilip held meetings and processions a few days previous, for staying\r\nthe plague of worms in wheat ears, and I have no doubt they were\r\ndelighted with the apparent success of their measures; knowledge of the\r\nhabits of the insect would, however, have taught them the futility of\r\ntheir attempts at so late a period of the season. The same insect caused\r\nextensive injury in 1825.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we walked with Mr ——, to call on his neighbour ——, who\r\nonce farmed in my native district, and whom we found engaged in\r\nhay-making. He had lately bought a farm, subject to an annuity on the\r\nlives of an old French Canadian and his wife. He was in good spirits,\r\nand had lost none of the rotundity of form carried from Scotland.\r\n\r\nFeeling a desire to examine a bull-frog, a reptile which abounds in a\r\npond in front of Mr ——’s house, I found them large, of a dirty green\r\ncolour, with a remarkably large mouth, and in formation similar to the\r\nfrog of Britain.\r\n\r\nMr ——’s farm is not of great extent, and, considering the excellency of\r\nhis dwelling-house, was a cheap purchase. In an enclosure in front of\r\nthe house, grew some hickory-trees, the nuts of which are held in esteem\r\nby the population. The first year of his purchase, these trees bore a\r\ngreat crop, while there was a failure of this nut generally; and he told\r\nme the value of his nuts actually amounted to the interest of the whole\r\nprice of the estate.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Mr ——, Miss ——, my friend and I, set out at five o’clock,\r\nin a four-wheeled waggon, drawn by a strong little Canadian horse, and\r\narrived at Chambly in the midst of a thunderstorm and rain, which\r\ndetained us during the day, by rendering the roads impassable. The soil\r\nin this part of the country is clay, of the most adhesive texture, and\r\nthe roads being without stone, the clay became so waxy after the rain,\r\nas to remind me of bird-lime. Our horse would have had difficulty in\r\npulling the empty waggon along the road, and I found walking on foot a\r\nvery slow and arduous mode of proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe rain having abated, we walked out, after dinner, to view the village\r\nof Chambly, which is situated on the river Richlieu, in a fine bay or\r\nbasin, three miles wide, and at the head of the navigation. At present\r\nthere is a canal forming, to connect the waters of Lake Champlain with\r\nChambly basin, and which is expected to be completed in course of next\r\nyear. The village contains several churches and mills, and is celebrated\r\nfor seminaries of education. Here young ladies are taught the French and\r\nEnglish languages grammatically, arithmetic, writing, and drawing, for\r\n$5 a-month, or about 21s. sterling, finding themselves with books,\r\nbed-clothes, and washing. Gentlemen are educated for L.20 a-year,\r\nincluding all branches of education, board, and washing. Some excellent\r\nstone barracks are in the village, which is reckoned an important post\r\nin approaching Quebec from the States. They were unoccupied, and in good\r\norder. The river above the village forms a continued rapid for a mile or\r\ntwo, and affords ample power for propelling machinery.\r\n\r\nThe state of the weather and roads induced me to abandon the plan of\r\nvisiting the Eastern Townships, and we agreed to pass down the banks of\r\nthe Richlieu to Sorrel. We obtained a cart, in which a seat was placed\r\nfor my friend D—— and me; and we set out, driven by a boy who was said\r\nto know the road well, followed by Mr —— and Miss —— in the waggon we\r\nall four occupied the previous day. A more wretched equipment than the\r\none furnished us seldom appeared. A ragged boy drove a small lean\r\nCanadian mare, which hopped on three legs; and the ill fitting wheels of\r\nour crazy cart besmeared us with mud, and creaked so loud, that we could\r\nscarcely hear each other speak, while almost every passenger cracked a\r\njoke on our musical vehicle. After jogging on for more than an hour, it\r\nwas discovered we were on the road leading to Montreal, instead of that\r\nto Sorrel. A council was held—we determined to continue the route, and\r\nMr —— and Miss —— returned. We soon reached Longueil, and crossed the St\r\nLawrence in an awkward-looking ferry-boat, propelled by horses. This\r\nhorse-power differed from that we had seen used in the States for\r\nsimilar purposes, by the horses walking round a circle instead of\r\nremaining stationary. The machinery of the boat was fitted up for\r\ntwenty-two, although only fourteen horses were attached, and the poor\r\nanimals were unmercifully goaded by two ruffian drivers. On landing on\r\nthe opposite side of the river, we walked to Montreal in time for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThe soil, from Lapraire to Chambly, and around the village, is strong\r\nclay, varying considerably in quality, and uniformly ill managed. Parts\r\nof the canal channel, forming near Chambly, showed no change of soil at\r\nthe depth of ten feet. The soil also from Chambly to Longueil was clay,\r\nand part of the country was flooded by the rain of the previous day. The\r\nwhole surface bore evidence of want of draining, and how essential\r\nknowledge is to improved agriculture. In many instances, soil of the\r\nbest quality did not yield more than two seeds of wheat, while the crops\r\nwere intermingled with truly luxuriant indigenous tares, thistles, and\r\nwhite clover. I had often heard of the French Canadians clinging to\r\ntheir farms until starved from them—that is, till the soil did not yield\r\nthem food to subsist on, and I had here evidence of the process and\r\nresult of such an agricultural system. The ravages of the wheat-fly were\r\neverywhere evident.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the population, houses, and gardens, resembled that of\r\nTerre Bonne, excepting that the floors of many dwelling-houses were\r\nraised two or three feet above the ground, the result, doubtless, of the\r\nwetness of their situation.\r\n\r\nAfter dining at Montreal, we visited the nursery grounds of Mr C——,\r\nwhich were by far the cleanest and most productive of any we saw in\r\nAmerica, on our way to the mountain. The mountain is about 700 feet\r\nhigh, situated at a short distance from the town, and one of its chief\r\nornaments. From its summit is seen an immense extent of diversified\r\ncountry, together with the waters of the St Lawrence and Ottawa flowing\r\nin their various channels—those of the latter, by dividing, form the\r\nislands of Montreal and Jesus. The mountain is altogether destitute of\r\npublic walks or carriage drives, although admirably adapted for both,\r\nbeing covered with trees, and affording some truly interesting views,\r\nwhich change at every step.\r\n\r\nNext morning, in company with our kind and attentive friend, ——, Mr D——\r\nand I rode in a gig round the country lying to the north and west of the\r\nmountain, calling on different individuals, and examining several farms\r\nfor sale. During our drive, we visited the race-course at St Pierre,\r\nwhere we saw three horses belonging to Mr —— get a gallop. One was\r\nparticularly small, and none of them seemed to possess racing merit. On\r\nleaving the race-course, we drove to Lachine rapids, and returned by the\r\nriver side to Montreal, much gratified with our excursion.\r\n\r\nA young thriving hedge of English thorn was observed at a village on the\r\nnorth side of the mountain. Bushvetch, _vicia caraca_, and yellow\r\nclover, were growing plentifully, and I also met with the latter at\r\nChambly. Mildew was seen on wheat where the crop was strong, and the\r\nravages of the fly generally traced, though they did not exist to the\r\nsame extent as on the south side of the St Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the island of Montreal, about seventy miles in\r\ncircumference, is variable, including gravel, clay, sand, and peat; the\r\ntwo former preponderating, and a great part of all requires draining.\r\nLimestone is abundant, and on one farm I found marl, which we tested\r\nwith vinegar. The land is held by French tenure, and divided, in the\r\nFrench manner, into long narrow portions of from 70 to 220 acres. The\r\nagriculture cannot be said to have been reduced to system, if we except\r\nthe alternation of wheat and thistle pasture, already noticed. A better\r\nstate of things is, however, about to dawn—several British farmers\r\nhaving commenced operations near the town of Montreal, and are draining,\r\nliming, and manuring freehold as well as leasehold properties. At\r\npresent, the most lucrative department of farming is raising vegetables\r\nfor the market, and from the cheapness of manure, the limited extent of\r\nfree dry soil, the skill requisite for producing market stuffs, and the\r\nprospect of increasing population, this description of husbandry is\r\nlikely to continue profitable for a great length of time. Manure during\r\npart of the year is obtained without price, and it rarely exceeds\r\nsixpence a cart-load. Vegetables are extravagantly dear at all times. My\r\nfriend, Mr ——, while I was with him, sold a considerable extent of\r\npotatoes at L.35 per acre.\r\n\r\nHay fetches a high price at Montreal, more especially that of timothy\r\ngrass for horses. Clover hay is only bought for the use of cows. Two\r\nScotch farmers, in the neighbourhood of Montreal, sow from two to three\r\nlbs. of red clover seed to an acre; and I doubt if it is economical to\r\ndo so when hay is grown for sale, as clover is more than one penny\r\na-stone cheaper than timothy hay. A milch-cow can be grazed during the\r\nseason for $1, and near Montreal, for $2, or 8s. 6d. sterling for a\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe price of land on the island is from L.10 to L.20 per acre, according\r\nto quality, situation, and buildings. Labour is moderate, in the\r\nAmerican sense of the word. Mr D—— had let the cutting of his barley\r\ncrop, which was good, and the work well executed (to both of which I\r\ntestify) to French Canadians, at 7s. 6d. sterling per acre, without\r\nfood, or any etcetera. Mr ——, near Laprairie, paid a stout active East\r\nLothian ploughman by the year, L.15 Halifax money, 6½ Lothian bolls of\r\noatmeal, 3 bolls potatoes, 2 bushels peas, and a month’s meat in\r\nharvest, a cow’s keep, a house and garden, with 10 cords of firewood. A\r\nsecond servant got the same wages in kind, with L.12 in money. Mr ——,\r\nalso, near Laprairie, paid his servant $8 per month, and his second,\r\n$7—both found, or L.20 sterling a-year, with bed and board.\r\n\r\nThe city of Montreal is situated on an island of the same name, on the\r\nnorth bank of the St Lawrence, and at the head of the ship navigation of\r\nthe river. The houses consist chiefly of stone, and are disposed in\r\nnarrow streets. The principal building is the Catholic church, a\r\ncapacious building, not quite finished on the original plan for want of\r\nfunds, and said to be capable of holding nearly 10,000 souls. The\r\npopulation amounts to about 30,000 souls, and the trade is most\r\nextensive. While Upper Canada, and the western part of the Lower\r\nProvince, continue to prosper, limits cannot be set to the increase of\r\nMontreal, which is at present the most important place of trade in the\r\nBritish American possessions. Should manufactures ever flourish in Lower\r\nCanada, Lachine rapids could supply Montreal with an unlimited\r\nwater-power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Montreal to Hamilton—Separation of Friends—Rideau\r\n    Canal—Emigrants passing up the St\r\n    Lawrence—Massena—Waddington—Ogdensburgh—Lake of the Thousand\r\n    Isles—Andrew Dinwoodie, a Farmer from Dumfries-shire—Live-stock from\r\n    England—Innkeeper of Kingston—Great Britain Steamer—Emigrant\r\n    Passengers—John By Steamer._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving long made up my mind to visit the western parts of Upper Canada,\r\nand the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri, it was necessary to\r\nseparate from my companion, in whose company I had spent so many happy\r\nhours, and to whose disinterested friendship I owe more than it will\r\never be in my power to repay. It was arranged that he should take my\r\ntrunk and portmanteau to New York, to wait my arrival there, having\r\nexperienced the inconvenience of attempting to take luggage through a\r\nthinly-peopled district. I reserved a plain suit of clothes, which had\r\nalready become shabby. Packing two shirts of cotton, and one of flannel,\r\nfive collars, five pair of cotton stockings, and a dressing-case, into a\r\nsmall leathern cloak-bag which my friend had used for buckling behind\r\nhis saddle in Scotland, I left Montreal on the 18th of August; having\r\narranged to be at certain places on fixed days, so as to reach New York\r\nin the first week of November. My friend left Montreal some hours before\r\nme, on a visit to New Glasgow, and, after seeing Quebec, travelled by\r\nLake Champlain to New York, and reached England on the 17th September.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to pass along the line of the Rideau canal, so much\r\npraised by engineers, and sneered at by utilitarians, and which\r\nnine-tenths of those best capable of judging of its merits condemn as a\r\nlavish misapplication of national expenditure; but the irregularity of\r\nthe conveyances by this route, and my limited time, induced me to ascend\r\nthe St Lawrence; and, by way of varying the scene, I took the American\r\nline of conveyances—travelling by stage to Lachine, and from thence to\r\nCascades by steam, from Cascades to Coteau du Lac by stage, and again by\r\nsteam to Cornwall, which we reached by 2 A.M. of the 11th.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the dark-coloured Ottawa, and limpid St Lawrence, formed a\r\nstriking contrast on the way to Cascades, situated on the former. The\r\nbanks of the St Lawrence were observed in some places to consist of clay\r\ntwenty feet deep, without any admixture—some excellent soil was seen\r\nabove Cascades—the wheat crop from Montreal upwards was perfectly ripe,\r\nand barley in some instances carried.\r\n\r\nAt Coteau du Lac our steamer took seven batteaux, or open boats, in tow,\r\nin one of which I counted 110 emigrants, of all ages, who were doomed to\r\npass the night on board. Men, women, and children were huddled together\r\nas close as captives in a slave-trader, exposed to the sun’s rays by\r\nday, and river damp by night, without protection. It was impossible to\r\nlook upon such a group of human beings without emotion. The day had been\r\nso intensely hot, that the stoutest amongst them looked fatigued, while\r\nthe females seemed ready to expire with exhaustion. Conversation was\r\ncarried on in whispers, and a heaviness of heart seemed to pervade the\r\nwhole assemblage. Never shall I forget the countenance of a young\r\nmother, ever anxiously looking at twin infants slumbering on her knee,\r\nand covering them from the vapour rising from the river, and which\r\nstrongly depicted the feelings of maternal affection and pious\r\nresignation. Night soon veiled the picture, and, I fear, brought no\r\nrelief to the anxious mother. The navigation up the St Lawrence in\r\nbatteaux is accomplished by propelling them with poles, and is\r\nnecessarily tedious. The accommodation is so wretched and irksome, that\r\nthe emigrants’ privations of transport may be said only to commence at\r\nMontreal, where they perhaps expected them to end, and when their\r\nspirits are ill fitted to bear up against them. Steam conveyance of late\r\nmust have shortened their sufferings.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Cornwall I immediately proceeded on board the American\r\nsteam-boat Dalhousie, which conveyed us across to Hoogdensburgh by six\r\nA. M. From thence we were conveyed to Ogdensburgh by land, passing\r\nthrough the villages of Massena and Waddington. We breakfasted at\r\nMassena springs, the waters of which possess medicinal qualities, and\r\nare pleasantly situated on a branch of the Racket.\r\n\r\nThe thriving village of Waddington is on the St Lawrence, and opposite\r\nto which, on an island in the river, is situated the handsome residence\r\nof Governor Ogden.\r\n\r\nThe country in this part of the state of New York is of indifferent\r\nsoil, and very partially cleared; the farm-houses are of the meanest\r\ndescription, and there is no appearance of wealth or comfort amongst the\r\nrural population. In many instances farmers were engaged in securing\r\ntheir hay crops on the Sabbath, and much wheat was standing in a state\r\nof over-ripeness. The previous state of the weather may, in some\r\nmeasure, explain both proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Ogdensburgh shortly after nightfall, at an excellent\r\nhotel, which seemed filled with people. Tea, or, in common parlance of\r\nthe country, supper, was soon provided for the stage-passengers, who did\r\nample justice to the viands. On learning a steam-boat was to sail next\r\nmorning at daybreak for Kingston, I retired to a double bedroom, in\r\ncompany with Mr M——, a north country Scotsman, who had just arrived in\r\nthe country, and was travelling to York. The landlord of the hotel\r\nshowed us personally to our bedroom, and also conducted us to the quay\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nOgdensburgh is situated at the confluence of the Oswegatchie river with\r\nthe St Lawrence, and is the lower termination of American navigation on\r\nLake Ontario. It has many appearances of prosperity, and contains a\r\npopulation of nearly two thousand souls.\r\n\r\nAt five in the morning the United States steam-boat left Ogdensburgh,\r\ncalling at Morristown on the American side of the lake, and on the\r\nBritish one at Brockville and Kingston, where I remained for the\r\nevening. Darkness prevented me seeing the Lake of the Thousand Isles, on\r\nmy way down to Montreal, and I was not fortunate in passing up during\r\nday. The Lake of the Thousand Isles takes its name from the number of\r\nislands which it contains, and is about forty miles in length; forming\r\nthe termination of Lake Ontario, and commencement of the river St\r\nLawrence. The islands are generally small rocks, a few feet above water,\r\ncovered with stunted trees, standing as close together as curling-stones\r\non a rink of ice in Scotland, and completely excluding a sight of the\r\nmainland. The weather was unfavourable, a drizzling rain having set in,\r\nwhich perhaps affected my feelings, and increased the sombreness of the\r\nscenery, which at all times possesses little interest from the want of\r\nlife. So much is this felt, that a gentleman of my acquaintance, passing\r\nup the Lake of the Thousand Isles a few weeks before, was sitting by a\r\ntraveller engaged with his note-book, when a crow came in sight. He\r\ninterrupted the writer, and begged he would notice the crow, as it was\r\nthe only moving thing he had seen during three hours’ sail.\r\n\r\nOn board of the United States I had a long conversation with a\r\nfellow-passenger, Andrew Dinwuddie, from Dumfries-shire, in Scotland,\r\nand I hope he will pardon me mentioning his name. Andrew was an\r\nexcellent specimen of his cautious countrymen, and showed credentials\r\nhighly honourable to his honesty and integrity. He had come to America\r\nin spring, accompanied by two brothers, who had purchased land near\r\nPrescott, paying L.300 for 200 acres, seventy of them being cleared.\r\nAndrew was unmarried, and determined to look about him before sitting\r\ndown for life. After assisting his brothers to plant their potatoes, he\r\nworked with an English farmer in the neighbourhood of Ogdensburgh for a\r\nmonth, and was now on his way to Geneva and Canandaigua in the state of\r\nNew York, at which places he intended to work for some time. Andrew\r\nseemed to have belonged to what is called in Scotland the class of small\r\nfarmers, and was much pleased with the change of country he had made;\r\nhaving assisted at the Englishman’s hay and wheat harvest, for which he\r\ngot $8 a-month, working moderately, and messing with his employer on the\r\nbest of fare. He had found no difficulty in mowing during the warm\r\nweather;—and greatly preferred American butcher-meat three times a-day,\r\nto the oatmeal porridge, barley bread, and sour milk of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhile at Kingston, ten short-horned cattle, nineteen Southdown sheep,\r\nand a lot of swine, came to the yard of the Kingston hotel, at which I\r\nlodged, on their way to the county of Dumfries, Upper Canada, direct\r\nfrom England. They were objects of interest to many of the inhabitants,\r\nand were seemingly in excellent health and condition.\r\n\r\nI left Kingston about dusk for York, in the St George steam-boat; one of\r\nthe shafts broke when opposite the Bay of Quinte, and we returned to\r\nKingston about noon next day. Another vessel was immediately expected to\r\ncarry us on our voyage; and, in the meantime, the captain refused the\r\npassengers dinner; and four of us went on shore to dine, in order to be\r\nin readiness. We called at the Commercial Hotel, esteemed the first\r\nhouse of entertainment in Upper Canada; and, on an application at the\r\nbar, were told a joint could not be prepared for us until four o’clock.\r\nHaving stated it was possible to dine without a joint, and we soon\r\nexpected a steam-boat to take us to York, a mutton-chop was promised in\r\nhalf-an-hour. We had not, however, retired to the parlour five minutes,\r\nwhen a spruce waiter entered, and told us Mr Macdonald would not give\r\ndinner. I could not help contrasting this treatment with what we\r\nexperienced at Ogdensburgh; and if Mr Macdonald’s behaviour passes for\r\nBritish manners and hospitality, they have not improved by\r\ntransportation to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Great Britain, one of the largest vessels on Lake Ontario, was laid\r\nalongside of the St George, and all hands employed in transferring the\r\ncargo of the one to the other. A passage was made from the upper decks\r\nof both vessels, along which the passengers passed to and fro; and as\r\nthey came crowding up stairs for hours together with their luggage,\r\nreminded me of bees entering a hive laden with pollen; it was eleven\r\no’clock before the bustle was over, and the vessel under weigh. I\r\nobserved a quantity of gunpowder conveyed from the St George to the\r\nGreat Britain in the most careless manner, and locked in the captain’s\r\nroom. The owner of the Great Britain, Mr ——, was on board at the time,\r\nand must have sanctioned the transport of this dangerous commodity.\r\n\r\nThe night-scene on board the Great Britain formed a counterpart to that\r\nof the batteau on the St Lawrence, almost every inch of surface being\r\ncrowded with reposing individuals; the lower decks and passages were\r\ncrowded to excess, and a great part of the upper deck, which is\r\nuncovered, was also occupied. The aged and infirm sought shelter below;\r\nthe boys clustered round the chimney stalks for heat, while the more\r\nhardy stretched themselves on the upper deck without almost any\r\ncovering, surrounded by forms, or under lee of large packages. Near the\r\nstern of the vessel a young woman, perhaps with a view of avoiding\r\ndanger, placed three infants on her outspread mantle, with their\r\ninnocent faces towards heaven; and as they gradually sunk to rest, the\r\nmotion of their slumbering eyelids seemed mimicry of the twinkling stars\r\nin the firmament.\r\n\r\nThe Great Britain reached York about six P.M., previous to which the\r\npassengers were mustered on the upper deck, and paid their\r\npassage-fares on going below. Many of the emigrant deck-passengers had\r\nnot, or affected not to have, money; and I saw two middle-aged\r\nrespectable-looking females place part of their wardrobe in pawn for\r\ntheir fares, and luggage had been credited from conveyance to\r\nconveyance all the way from Montreal, with the fares of its owners.\r\nSteam-boat proprietors do not lose much in this way, as the friends of\r\nemigrants generally relieve the pawned effects.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of emigrants and their friends at York was an interesting\r\nsight. In particular, a group of Scotch Highlanders, consisting of old\r\nwomen and half-a-dozen of innocent-looking girls, incapable of speaking\r\nthe English language, appeared in ecstasy at joining their friends on\r\nthe pier, who seemed to have arrived in the country some time before.\r\nThey laughed, embraced, and saluted each other on the cheek, which is\r\nrarely witnessed in America.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate a gentleman, I lodged in the Steam-boat Hotel at York,\r\nwhich I found an indifferent establishment in the sleeping department. I\r\ncould not have remained a second night, or gone to bed the first one,\r\nhad light enabled me to see the actual state of things.\r\n\r\nA friend having agreed to accompany me in a tour through the western\r\npart of Upper Canada, and who was waiting my arrival, we left York\r\ntogether, in the John By steamer, for Hamilton, where we arrived at\r\neleven o’clock. The John By had been constructed to ply on the Rideau\r\ncanal, with paddle wheels in the stern—the worst sailing and\r\nill-constructed boat in Canada. The engine was high pressure; and if a\r\nvessel was to be built for roasting passengers, the John By might have\r\nfurnished useful hints. She was soon afterwards wrecked.\r\n\r\nWe could not gain admittance into any of the hotels at Hamilton, except\r\none, on account of the lateness of the hour. The beds were all occupied\r\nbefore our arrival; but the bar-keeper said he would place one on the\r\nfloor, where Mr C—— and I were soon stretched side by side, and soon\r\nafterwards some individuals, similarly situated, were admitted to share\r\nour bed. On awakening next morning I missed Mr C—— from my side, who was\r\nlying in a distant corner of the room; and he afterwards told me, that\r\ndisliking the company which joined us, he slipped from bed so soon as he\r\ncould do so unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey on the Banks of the Grand River—Corduroy Roads—River-side\r\n    Vegetation—Cradling—Settler from Edinburgh—Reserve of the Six\r\n    Nations—Nellis Settlement—Indian Notices—Settler from\r\n    Perthshire—First Settlers— Gentle Children—Agricultural\r\n    Notices—Great Heat—Drinking Water—Raising Bee—Brantford—Oak\r\n    Openings—Paris—Galt—Guelph—Waggoner at Table—Face of the\r\n    Country—Dutch Hotel._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rose very early next morning, and rode in a hired waggon to a\r\nfriend’s near Albion mills, where we breakfasted, and set out for the\r\nGrand River, accompanied by a third person, to whom I had written to\r\nhold himself in readiness for the excursion. The road was tolerably\r\ngood, until within four or five miles of the river, which then consists\r\nof almost one unbroken line of corduroy, on reaching which we returned\r\nthe waggon, and walked the remainder of the journey. A corduroy road,\r\nor, in the language of the country, crossway, is formed of the trunks of\r\ntrees, laid close to each other, so that animals and carriages may pass\r\nwithout touching the ground. It is formed wherever the soil is wet, and\r\nmay be considered log pavement. We came in contact with the river at\r\nBrant’s tavern, where a wooden building was erecting of some\r\npretensions, and continued our walk down the left bank, where Mr W——\r\nresides, about two miles below the tavern.\r\n\r\nThe soil from Hamilton to the Grand River is chiefly clay, of good\r\nquality, and well settled, with exception of the Indian reserve on the\r\nbanks of the river. From Brant’s tavern to Mr W——’s, the road is\r\nbeautiful, the banks of the river being fringed with plum, cherry,\r\napple-trees, and hawthorn, encircled with the wild vine, the foliage of\r\nwhich was particularly rich. I have often remarked the luxuriance and\r\nbeauty of river-side vegetation, and more especially in America, which,\r\nno doubt, is in a great measure owing to the copious supply of moisture\r\nafforded the plants by evaporation, and which is the more abundant on\r\nmoderate-sized rivers in a country like America, where the temperature\r\nof day and night varies considerably.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the crops had been carried, and those of wheat\r\nremaining in the field appeared particularly shabby, compared with those\r\nof Britain, being thin on the ground and short in the sheaf. I examined\r\na cradler at work in an oatfield, who was making good work, cutting low,\r\nand laying down the ears with regularity. The implement is brought round\r\nwith a full and awkward-looking sweep, nine or ten feet wide, and jerked\r\nso as to throw off the stalks, the whole of which are collected in the\r\ncradle. By this mode of operating, the cradler supports the weight of\r\nthe crop collected in the sweep on his arms, and receives no relief from\r\nany part of the cut crop, or implement resting on the ground, as in the\r\ncase of mowing grass with the common scythe of Britain: a heavy crop of\r\ngrain must, therefore, be particularly fatiguing to the cradler.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr W—— at home, who had been expecting us for a day or two, in\r\nconsequence of having been written to. He had been known to us all when\r\nin Edinburgh, which he left in the previous month of March, and had only\r\nbeen a few weeks in his present situation in the Nellis Settlement on\r\nthe Grand River. He had purchased six or seven hundred acres, about\r\nseventy of which were cleared, and there was a good house, in the\r\nCanadian sense of the word, on the property. For some time after the\r\npurchase, he resided with the former proprietor, who only left the house\r\na few days before our arrival. His household establishment consisted of\r\na newly-imported Scotch ploughman; and as our host had not himself been\r\naccustomed to house-keeping at any period of his life, the house may\r\nhave justly been termed Bachelor Hall. The evening was spent in walking\r\nover the property, and admiring the beauty of the situation. Next\r\nmorning Mr W—— explained the peculiarity of his circumstances with\r\nregard to household matters, which were temporary, and excited in all of\r\nus mirth instead of regret. The breakfast table was laid out with the\r\nonly animal substance in the house, a large bone of mutton, the fragment\r\nof a joint which had been prepared for us three days before, and now\r\nproduced to show we would have fared better had we kept our appointment.\r\nI had made up my mind to try if there was flesh on the bone, which could\r\nnot be ascertained without using a knife, but unfortunately a large dog\r\nscampered off with the relick before our eyes. Mr W—— at this time was\r\nin the kitchen, infusing tea, and, when informed of the catastrophe,\r\npromised to reward with a swing in a rope the poor dog, which had no\r\nmaster, and had taken up its quarters with him a day or two before. A\r\nconsultation was held about obtaining a substitute for the bone, when\r\ntwo of us went in quest of hen-eggs, a nest of which was found in the\r\nbarn, containing a great supply. On searching for the means of cooking\r\nthem, we could only find a boiler with a hole in the side, which seemed\r\nto serve for general use. Into this vessel part of the eggs were put,\r\nbut it was impracticable to make the water boil, as it would have\r\nescaped through the hole. On removing them, they were found sufficiently\r\ndone, and formed an excellent repast in connexion with the best wheaten\r\nbread I ever met with, and which had been baked by the lady of the\r\nformer proprietor.\r\n\r\nI have noticed these particulars in Mr W——’s household, from being\r\namongst the first real Backwood scenes we had met with, and which his\r\nkindness and good-humour would have rendered agreeable under any\r\ncircumstances. He had been accustomed to move in the best society in\r\nEdinburgh, and the facility with which he accommodated himself to his\r\naltered situation, was deserving of praise. It has been said, the\r\ncircumstances of his household were temporary; and I have since learned\r\nhe soon afterwards married a young lady, whom I saw on the banks of the\r\nGrand River, and trust he now enjoys that degree of happiness he so well\r\nmerits, and which I sincerely wish him.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon of the day after our arrival, Mr W—— drove my two\r\nfriends, C—— and S——, down the banks of the river, I riding on\r\nhorseback, in company with Mr W. N——. The banks form what is called the\r\nReserve of the Six Nations, which extends from the mouth of the river on\r\nLake Erie to Brantford, a distance of about fifty miles, and embraces\r\nthree miles on each side of the river. The Indians granted part of their\r\nlands, upwards of fifty years ago, to individuals chiefly of Dutch\r\nextraction, who then settled on them, and whose descendants are still\r\nresident. The land so granted is called the Nellis Settlement, and is\r\none of the most beautiful spots in Upper Canada. The poor Indians of the\r\nSix Nations, like every one of the many tribes in America which have\r\ncome in contact with white men, have greatly decreased in numbers, and\r\nhave recently sold to the British Government fourteen miles in length of\r\ntheir Reserve from the mouth of the river, and which has been surveyed,\r\nand was brought into the market a few weeks after my visit there. To see\r\nthis district was the object of our excursion, but which the state of\r\nthe roads and want of time prevented our accomplishing. We retraced our\r\nsteps, after passing about half a mile into the newly ceded territory.\r\n\r\nA number of well-dressed Indians of both sexes were passing up and down\r\nthe banks of the river on horseback, with good saddles and bridles. In\r\none instance, an Indian and his wife, or squaw, as they are called in\r\nthe language of the country, were riding together, she after the manner\r\nof Englishwomen, with a child sitting behind, and the husband had a\r\nchild before him.\r\n\r\nIn going down the river, we called on an Indian of reputed wealth, named\r\nFish Carrier. He is a stout middle-aged man, with a wife and family. His\r\nlog-house had an appearance of comfort, having two large well-glazed\r\nwindows in front, a door with veranda to the back, and a stone chimney\r\nstack. The family seemed to have finished a repast shortly before our\r\narrival,—a good table being covered with plates, knives, and forks,\r\nrecently used. There were two four-posted beds in the room, five or six\r\nchairs, a cat, and several dogs. There were horses, cows, and pigs in\r\nthe woods. Fish Carrier could imperfectly understand, but was unable to\r\nspeak the English language, and Mr W. N—— being similarly situated with\r\nthe Indian one, the conversation of the parties was short and\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nSome distance below Fish Carrier’s is the Council-house of the tribes, a\r\nlong narrow wooden building, with an upper and lower range of benches\r\nround both sides, on which the senators recline during counsel. It is\r\nkept by two old women, who cook on days of meeting. At the time of our\r\nvisit they were in the act of churning, and I sipped a little of the\r\nbuttermilk. The butter was particularly white in colour. I also partook\r\nof bread made from Indian corn meal, mixed with a few unhusked French\r\nbeans, which looked like raisins in a cake. The bread was soft and damp,\r\nand seemed to have been prepared by boiling. To me it was unpalatable,\r\nalthough some of my friends did not dislike it. The roof was hung with\r\nears of Indian corn, considered public property, which are contributed\r\nby individuals in years of abundance, and reserved for times of\r\nscarcity. The Council-house is also used for dancing, and contained a\r\nnumber of ornaments worn on such occasions, consisting of strings of\r\nbones for fixing on different parts of the body, and prized for the\r\nclattering they make when in motion.\r\n\r\nOn our return, a young Indian, of fifteen or sixteen years of age, shot\r\na small bird with an arrow from a common bow, and on being requested to\r\ntry and strike the bird when dead, he placed it on the trunk of a tree,\r\nand missed it twice. Five small boys were shooting birds with a\r\nblow-gun, and amused me by their manner of stealing up to the object of\r\ntheir attack. The blow-gun is a long narrow wooden tube, with a small\r\narrow, on the end of which is a quantity of thistle down neatly dressed,\r\nand which fills the tube, so as to give effect to the arrow, which is\r\ndischarged from the gun by the breath of the sportsman. It is little\r\nbetter than a child’s toy.\r\n\r\nHaving a desire to see the lands which Government had obtained from the\r\nIndians, Mr C—— and I set out next day at seven A.M., furnished with\r\nhorses, through the kindness of friends, to visit Mr B——. We had not,\r\nhowever, gone far when his horse became so lame that he returned, and I\r\nproceeded alone, down the banks of the river, which I lost sight of, and\r\nafter a long ride came to a settled part of the country, where I found\r\nmyself on the road to Cranberry, and four miles from the river. On\r\nlearning the direction of the river, I entered the woods with a tired\r\nhorse, which I led in my hand, and after a tedious walk, gained the\r\nriver two miles below where the object of my search resided, and which I\r\nreached at two P.M. After resting the horse some time, I returned up the\r\nriver, and in two hours got over a distance which in the early part of\r\nthe day occupied seven hours. Many adventures are related throughout\r\nCanada of people having lost themselves in the woods; and there is so\r\nmuch danger in a bush excursion, that people unaccustomed to follow\r\ntracks in the wilderness, ought never to incur the hazard. A\r\nstubbornness of disposition led me to make an attempt to regain the\r\nriver without a compass. Guiding my course by the sun, my success was\r\ncomplete, but had clouds arisen to obscure it, my situation would have\r\nbeen unpleasant.\r\n\r\nOn introducing myself to Mr B——, he said he had heard of my arrival in\r\nthe country, and welcomed me kindly. He had only been settled a few\r\ndays, and was engaged in improving his house, with the assistance of an\r\nIndian, who understood cabinet-making. The Indian was preparing a duck\r\nfor dinner, of which I partook, sitting on a chest, and having another\r\nfor a table. The duck might be a canvassback, but I made no enquiry on\r\nthe subject, and it was without feathers, by which alone I could have\r\ndetermined the species. No food could be more grateful to my palate, and\r\nI rejoiced at so opportune an arrival. Mr B——, with the understanding of\r\nGovernment, purchased the Indian improvements, that is, paid them for\r\nthe house and cleared land; and was to pay afterwards the ordinary price\r\nof land to Government. He was said to have farmed in Perthshire,\r\nScotland, and resided some time in the state of New York before coming\r\nto Canada. Mentioning to him that I had been told of his leaving the\r\nStates in disgust with the people, he assured me such was not the case,\r\nas he felt ashamed of having left his acquaintance there, who had shown\r\nhim the utmost kindness, and whom he respected and loved.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the Nellis Settlement, I passed one or two habitations\r\nof white men on the river side, and seldom enjoyed a more agreeable\r\nride. The sun was low in the horizon, and gilded every object with a\r\nrich and soothing hue, so different from the fierce rays of summer\r\nnoonday, that an admirer of nature seldom loses an opportunity of\r\nviewing its loveliness. A romantic fancy may suppose this tint of the\r\nsetting sun an affectionate evening adieu to nature; and such are its\r\neffects on vegetation, that I have seen the Scottish farmer stalk forth,\r\nand gaze on the beauty of his crops, although perhaps insensible of the\r\ncause of his pleasure. The unruffled waters, beneath a cloudless sky,\r\nreflected objects on the surrounding banks; while Indian cots, situated\r\non the most prominent points of the terrace, occasionally met the eye.\r\nWhen contemplating a landscape, where several small islands seemed\r\nreposing on the surface of the river, and on which grew luxuriant Indian\r\ncorn, overtopped with magnificent sunflowers in full blossom, gentle\r\nripples issuing from beneath a bush on the bank of an island, led me to\r\nexpect waterfowl, but a squaw, standing erect, came gracefully paddling\r\na canoe filled with children, who had been cultivating the sunflower.\r\nSwan never guided her brood with more majesty and care than this female\r\ndid her offspring.\r\n\r\nI met some Indians, and a plain-looking white woman, with fair hair,\r\ndressed in Indian attire, and carrying a child of Indian hue. She was\r\nsaid to be a native of Ireland, and a solitary instance of a white\r\nfemale living with the Indians.\r\n\r\nMy friends were at a loss to conjecture the cause of my absence, as I\r\nengaged to dine at Mr N——’s, where I joined them a little after seven\r\no’clock. Next day we dined with Mr W. N——. These invitations came\r\nopportunely after the loss of the mutton bone; and I have no doubt were\r\nthe means of saving the lives of several of Mr W——’s fowls. It was\r\ngratifying to see the old settlers so attentive to Mr W—— on this\r\nemergency, and I was glad of the opportunity of witnessing the manners\r\nand customs of the descendants of the first inhabitants of this part of\r\nthe country. Mr N—— is pretty well advanced in life, a shrewd and\r\nwell-informed person, and has let his farm in shares to an Englishman.\r\nMr W. N—— is a very active middle-aged person, with a wife and family,\r\nand cultivates his farm personally. He lives in a small frame-house,\r\nwith plain furniture, and every thing we saw was plain and neat. Mrs W.\r\nN—— was also a native of Canada, cousin to her husband; had four or five\r\nchildren; and was, I believe, without a female servant or help. The\r\nchildren were thus the third generation which had been reared in\r\ncomparative seclusion on the banks of the Grand River. The softness of\r\nmanner, ease, and good-humour of the children, appeared equal to\r\nfamilies in the better ranks of life in my native country, and I was\r\nanxious to ascertain if this gentleness of manner was real. With this\r\nview I romped, fondled, and teased, within and without doors, the small\r\nboys, without ruffling their tempers; and trust my little friends\r\nHamilton and Nielson will in age display matured fruits of their sweet\r\nand early blossoms. Manner, like the disposition of children, is, to a\r\ncertain extent, the gift of nature; but the example of parents deeply\r\naffects families, more especially when shut out from society. This\r\nfamily unquestionably owed much to the good sense and conduct of both\r\nparents, and ought to go far in satisfying people in Britain that their\r\nchildren will not necessarily become savages by being removed to the\r\nwoods of Canada, if they themselves lead proper lives, which they ought\r\nto do for their children’s sake, if not for their own.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned a dam across the Grand River at Dunville for\r\nsupplying water to the Welland Canal, and which throws back the water in\r\nthe channel of the river for nearly twenty miles, until it reaches the\r\nNellis Settlement. The beauty of the river has been injured below this\r\npoint by the stagnant water having covered the low lands, destroyed the\r\ntrees, and imparted a marshy and gloomy character to the banks. In the\r\nNellis Settlement, the river possesses much of its original character,\r\nand is truly fine, gliding around some fertile and beautiful islands,\r\nwhile the rich flat lands on the banks extend a considerable distance\r\nback, and terminate in an undulating surface. The low land on the banks\r\nof the river is what is termed bottom, or interval land, in some parts\r\nof America, and is a fine rich loamy soil. The undulating ground is clay\r\nof good quality, and has not been cleared to any extent. The low lands\r\nare altogether cleared, though adorned with single and wide-spreading\r\ntrees; and it is here most of the settlers reside. If the Grand River is\r\nrendered navigable to Brantford by means of locks, as is talked of, the\r\ncharms of the Nellis Settlement, one of the most beautiful spots in the\r\nprovince, will be destroyed by the submersion of the islands and flats.\r\nThe soil of the Indian Reserve, including what was sold to government,\r\nas seen by me on the east side of the Grand River, is chiefly clay of\r\nmedium quality, with very little vegetable mould on the surface. In a\r\ndistance of nearly twenty miles, I observed only one or two streamlets\r\njoining the river, which does not augur favourably of the lands\r\nabounding in water, unless the springs flow in a westerly direction\r\ntowards the Welland or Chippaway River. The prevailing wood is oak.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture on the Grand River embraces the cultivation of wheat,\r\noats, clover, and Indian corn, by the white population, the Indians\r\nconfining their attention chiefly to Indian corn, and occasionally a\r\nlittle wheat. The female Indians bestow considerable attention on the\r\ncultivation of Indian corn, which is planted on the best of land by the\r\nriver side, and infinitely surpasses any thing I saw belonging to the\r\nwhite population. In many cases the crop was eight feet high, and almost\r\nalways has intermingled with it a few plants of the sunflower, still\r\nmore luxuriant than the corn, the large yellow flowers of which bending\r\ntowards the sun, impart a high degree of richness and beauty to the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nAt eight A.M. on the 21st August, the party at Mr W——’s broke up,\r\nCaptain A—— on horseback for Blenheim, S—— and the mutton-bone stealer\r\nfor Hamilton, and C—— and I on foot for Brantford. The morning was fine,\r\nand the road being through the Indian Reserve on the banks of the river,\r\nwe enjoyed our walk for some time. But towards noon the powerful rays of\r\na vertical sun shone on us, while the banks and trees excluded every\r\nbreath of air, and we suffered considerably from heat. My friend on two\r\noccasions petitioned for a few minutes’ rest, when we reclined under a\r\ntree to cool, almost naked. We reached Brantford to dinner, a distance\r\nof twenty-four miles, and learned the thermometer stood at ninety-four\r\ndegrees in the shade. In the evening we walked around Brantford, having\r\nquite recovered the fatigue and broiling we underwent in the early part\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nPeople frequently speak of the danger of drinking cold water in Canada,\r\nand recommend a mixture of spirits as a safeguard, a convenient doctrine\r\nfor such as delight in stimulants. Having at every period of my life\r\nindulged in the use of cold water when thirsty and taking exercise, I\r\nsaw no reason for a change of system while in America, which Mr C—— also\r\nfollowed. In walking through the Indian Reserve, we became thirsty, and\r\nbeing unable to discover water, we approached the dwelling of an Indian,\r\nin the hope of obtaining a supply. A well-dressed interesting young\r\nsquaw was sitting under a wooden shade, with a deer-skin, the embers of\r\na fire, and cooking apparatus before her, apart from the house, to avoid\r\nheating it. I asked for a drink, and on observing that she did not\r\ncomprehend the import of my words, motioned the action of drinking, when\r\nshe instantly glided into the house, and brought a snow-white bowl,\r\nwhich she presented with water. We made a second application at an\r\nIndian habitation, but our eloquence and gestures were unavailing, as\r\nthe inmates did not seem to wish to afford us relief. My friend now\r\ncontrasted the soft black eye and benevolent countenance of the squaw\r\nwho supplied water, with the dirty sordid looking creatures who denied\r\nit; and while we were engaged in debating whether the different\r\nappearances of the individuals really existed, or arose from our\r\nassociations connected with them, we suddenly beheld an interesting and\r\nextensive view at a bend of the river, lying 200 feet below; and in the\r\nforeground, at a few yards distance, a limpid fount bubbling forth from\r\nthe hollow trunk of a tree, at which we quenched our thirst.\r\n\r\nIn passing from Nellis Settlement to Brantford, two Indian school-houses\r\nwere observed, and we intended calling on their religious instructor, Mr\r\nN——, who was from home. The Indian houses were similar to those on the\r\nriver below, with glazed windows, verandas for excluding the rays of the\r\nsun, and a ladder on the roof for reaching the chimney-top. We several\r\ntimes pulled excellent apples, and passed one tree of remarkable size,\r\nloaded with fruit, surrounded by a fence, and its branches supported by\r\nprops.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the banks of the river was generally clay, though in some\r\nplaces sand, and there was a tract of five or six miles of excellent\r\nloam. The wood was chiefly oak, with here and there a few pines, which\r\non the west side seemed to prevail to the water’s edge. There is little\r\nagriculture on this part of the Reserve of any kind. At the Indian’s\r\ndwelling, where we obtained the drink of water, there was a good crop of\r\nwheat, well stacked, a waggon for carrying home the crop, and a good\r\nbarn. This day I commenced a collection of seeds, by selecting six\r\nspecies of wheat, three white chaffed varieties having red-skinned\r\ngrain, and three red chaffed varieties having very white grain.\r\n\r\nWhile at Brantford, we observed a raising bee, that is, raising the\r\nframe of a house by a collection of people. The frame had been\r\nconstructed, and the parts fitted beforehand, and the company had only\r\nto put them together. The process was expeditiously effected, the\r\nlargest timbers being hoisted to their places by long sharp-pointed\r\npoles. The power of brute-force was displayed; yet three men, with the\r\naid of mechanical power, might have accomplished the labour of thirty.\r\n\r\nBrantford owes its name to the celebrated Mohawk Indian chief, Brant,\r\nand is situated on a high bank on the east side of the Grand River. It\r\nis a growing place, containing six hundred souls. There is a new bridge\r\nerecting over the river, forming the great thoroughfare to the London\r\nand Western districts; and it is said to be in contemplation to render\r\nthe river navigable to this point. On the opposite side of the river,\r\nthere is an extensive rich-looking flat country, a part of which is\r\noccupied by Europeans on lease from the Indians.\r\n\r\nHaving experienced the inconvenience of walking in warm weather, we\r\ndebated whether to pursue the remainder of our journey on horseback or\r\nin a waggon, and determined on the latter, which was engaged at $3 per\r\nday, the driver finding himself and horses.\r\n\r\nNext morning Mr W——, Captain A——, my friend, and I, left Brantford early\r\nin the morning, on our way to Galt, and stopped to breakfast with a Mr\r\nC——, a successful farmer, residing within seven miles of Brantford. The\r\nfarm consists of what is called oak openings or plains; and, on\r\nexamination, I found the soil consisting partly of clay and partly of\r\nsand. The crops had been pretty good, especially a field of oats. The\r\nstraw of wheat in the barn showed no traces of mildew, and the grain was\r\nequal to any I had met with in America, a sample of which I preserved.\r\nOak openings or plains consist of stunted oak-trees, thinly scattered\r\nover the surface, so that the plough may frequently enter without\r\nfurther obstruction than what arises from the roots of bushes. It is\r\nquite certain that fire passes over the plains every year or two, and\r\ndestroys all tender vegetation. The effects of fire, I have no doubt,\r\nalso prevents the growth of the trees, which are sometimes pretty thick,\r\nand in other places several acres are found without any. Oak openings\r\nare free of vegetable mould, or even live vegetation of any value; the\r\nsoil is commonly light sand, and a superficial observer is apt to think\r\nnature hath pronounced the curse of sterility on such spots. But part of\r\nMr C——’s soil convinced me the thinness of the trees, and thriftless\r\nvegetation is not an effect of the nature of the soil, which is often\r\nmuch under-rated. Oak openings may be cultivated by girdling the trees,\r\nand ploughing with six oxen, and fallowing the ground two years.\r\n\r\nMr C—— speaks in high terms of his oak openings, only a small part of\r\nwhich, in my opinion, merited praise. He estimates the expense of\r\nraising the first wheat crop on such soil, including the price of land,\r\nand two years’ fallow, at $20 per acre, and the return of the first crop\r\nat twenty bushels. The price of wheat, last year’s crop, 1832, was $¾.\r\nGypsum, or plaster of Paris, he invariably applies to clover. Labourers\r\nare always to be had at from $10 to $13 a-month in summer. Winter lasts\r\nsix months. I was pleased with my visit to Mr C——, and on parting\r\nexpressed myself so to him.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we proceeded by way of Paris, so called from its\r\nquarries of gypsum, or plaster of Paris, situated on the Grand River,\r\neight miles from Brantford, and one below the Forks, at which there is\r\nmills. We soon afterwards reached Galt, also situated on the Grand\r\nRiver, over which there is a bridge. It contains a church, grist, saw,\r\nand pail mill; and several buildings are of stone. My friend had a\r\nletter of introduction, which he had brought from Edinburgh, to a\r\ngentleman in Galt, whom we understood to be in the habit of receiving\r\nthe bearers of such letters coolly. In order to guard against apparent\r\ndisappointment, we delayed calling with the letter till after dinner,\r\nand gave instructions for the horses to be put to the waggon before we\r\nleft the inn. Our reception was, however, all we could have wished,\r\nbeing asked to take wine, and tea, both of which we declined. In\r\nconversation, we learned he had left his own residence to avoid company,\r\nand building-lots in the village were not sold, for creating opposition\r\nto Mr——’s store. The prospect from Galt is pine forest of stunted\r\ngrowth, with a few straggling cedars on the margin of the river. We left\r\nGalt in the afternoon, and reached Guelph at eight P.M. Next day we rode\r\ninto the township of Eramosa, and returned to Guelph in time for dinner,\r\nand reached Galt in the evening.\r\n\r\nGuelph is finely situated on the river Speed, a branch of the Grand\r\nRiver, and is well supplied with water from springs as well as the\r\nriver, which drives mills, and over which there are two bridges. There\r\nare about fifty houses in the village, only one of which is of stone.\r\nThere is a market house of wood, roughly finished, and without a stall\r\nor a frequenter of any kind. Three considerable sized churches of\r\ndifferent sects, Catholic, Episcopalian, and Presbyterian, are being\r\nerected. Three weeks previous to our arrival, a range of six or seven\r\nwood houses had been burnt down, the brick chimneys of which were\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nThis village could boast of ruins, if not of antiquities. The bridges\r\nover the Speed at Guelph, and the corduroy, were decayed, and in a\r\nshameful state of neglect, alike marking the worthless nature of the\r\nwood and insufficient road-way management of the district.\r\n\r\nThe inn at Guelph is a good establishment for the country, and greatly\r\nsuperior to that at Galt. Our waggoner breakfasted and dined at the\r\npublic table, in company with two gentlemanly-looking persons, lately\r\nfrom England, without any explanation from the landlord. The waggoner\r\nwas a Lower Canadian, of French descent, and strongly resembling in size\r\nand feature the common description of Scotch peasantry. He spoke the\r\nEnglish language in a broken imperfect manner, and was an unassuming\r\nobliging person. This was the second time drivers had appeared at table\r\nsince reaching the American shore, and I did not experience\r\ninconvenience of any kind on either occasion from their presence, both\r\nhaving conducted themselves with the utmost propriety. A meal in the\r\nUnited States and Canada is simply a feeding, and not in any degree a\r\nconversational meeting; and ability to pay is therefore considered the\r\nstandard of admission to public tables. Britain and America are\r\nsimilarly situated in this respect, but in Britain the facilities of\r\ngetting private tables, and various degrees of entertainment, completely\r\nseparate travellers into different grades. Viewing meals as social\r\nmeetings, texture of coat or profession ought not to gain or deny an\r\nindividual admission to table; and wherever the inhabitants of a country\r\nhave not been brutalized, true politeness at a public table never fails\r\nto check vulgarity and impudence, as well as to impart pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe surface from Brantford to Galt, by way of Paris, is undulating,\r\nchiefly oak openings, consisting of dwarfish decaying oak-trees, with a\r\ngood deal of underwood, and scarcely a plant of grass or clover\r\ninterspersed. In some places a good deal of pine is seen, but every\r\ndescription of tree, including larch, is small and stunted looking.\r\n\r\nFrom Galt to Guelph, and in the neighbourhood of the latter, the soil is\r\nlight, composed of sand or gravel, bearing inferior crops, and, judging\r\nfrom the way sides, calculated to produce excellent pasturage. The wood\r\nis small sized; and the district abounding with limpid streams. Annual\r\nthistles were growing in vast numbers, and where cleared land had been\r\nneglected, were occupying the entire surface. The clearing of land was\r\ngoing on to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was much mildewed, and some fields we examined nearly\r\ndestroyed by it. Sleighs, mere arms of trees, were passing along the\r\nroads, drawn by two oxen, on which were small bags, seemingly going to\r\nthe grist-mill, and under guidance of a stout man, who could have\r\ncarried the bags on his shoulders. Such a misapplication of ox labour\r\narose, I fear, from laziness.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the country between Guelph and Galt is settled by\r\nDutchmen, many of whom have cleared farms of considerable size, with\r\ngood houses and barns. There is a respectable hotel within a few miles\r\nof Galt, at which we intended to stop for the night. On entering the\r\nbar-room, in which were ten or twelve people, the landlord was scolding\r\nhis wife in _high Dutch_; and as he continued deaf to our enquiries, we\r\nleft the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Galt to Goderich—Farmer from Roxburghshire—Female\r\n    Worth—Improved health of Scotch Farmers—Visit Captain\r\n    A * * *—Humming-birds—London Family in the Bush—Guides—Avon\r\n    Accommodation—German Settler—Notices of Nature._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving letters from some friends in Scotland to a relation of theirs\r\nnear Galt, who had formerly farmed in Roxburghshire, I was anxious to\r\ndeliver the letters personally, and set out at six o’clock in the\r\nmorning in search of his residence, which was difficult to find, from\r\nnot being named. On enquiring the way at an old man on the road, we got\r\ncertain information in broad Scotch; and in the course of conversation,\r\nhe told us he thought Canada a rough bit at first, but he now liked it.\r\nCalling at a house to ask the way, a man said it was one thing to put a\r\nquestion, and another to answer it. Seeing the individual was in a state\r\nof brutal intoxication, I walked to the waggon, followed by the poor\r\nwretch, vociferating disgusting oaths, who seemed exasperated by the\r\nsilence and contempt with which he was treated. I afterwards learned he\r\nhad a short time before beat his wife out of the house, and was\r\nconsidered on the high road to ruin.\r\n\r\nWe at length found the object of our search, Mr T——, walking in his\r\nfields with Mr R——, whom I had seen at Kingston. Mr T—— had only reached\r\nCanada the year before, and was not perhaps fairly set down. The farm he\r\nhad purchased was mostly cleared, and he was summer fallowing a\r\nconsiderable extent of land, which was well ploughed, and laid off into\r\nregular ridges. He had bought all the manure in the neighbourhood at\r\nabout sixpence per load, and was laughed at for having done so. The\r\nhouse was built of wood, and two beds were standing in recesses in the\r\napartment where we breakfasted. Mrs T—— apologized for the mean\r\nappearance of her house, which I assured her was unnecessary, as I found\r\nfew in the country so good, and its shining cleanness imparted more\r\ninterest to me than the highest glitter of British fashion. She was in\r\nexcellent spirits, and entertained us with many particulars of her\r\njourney from Scotland. Arriving at Montreal when cholera was raging in a\r\ndreadful manner, and her husband being in a delicate state of health, no\r\ntime was lost in pursuing their route. In passing up the St Lawrence\r\nwith her family and luggage, the boat admitted water so freely, that she\r\nwas forced to walk by the river side with an infant on her back. The\r\npopulation being panic-struck at the havoc cholera was making, shut\r\ntheir doors on emigrants, who, they imagined, had introduced the disease\r\ninto the country, and she was under the necessity of baking bread for\r\nher family with her own hands, and firing it under a tree. After\r\nrelating many particulars of their first settlement, she concluded by\r\nstating, that in Scotland she had three maid-servants constantly at her\r\nown command, here she had no servants, and was happier without them. On\r\nremarking it delighted me to find her in such excellent spirits and\r\npleased with her situation, as the change from the old country to Canada\r\nappeared more trying for ladies than gentlemen, she replied with\r\nanimation, “O no, sir, ladies can manage their own department here, but\r\ngentlemen require assistance in theirs.” Mrs T—— spoke with so much\r\ngood-humour and feeling, that it would have been rudeness to have\r\nmaintained an opposite opinion; and without investigating which of the\r\nsexes in the middle ranks of life undergo the greatest privations at\r\nfirst settlement, observation convinced me females get sooner reconciled\r\nto their duties, and discharge them with better effect than males. Much\r\nas I have ever esteemed my countrywomen, they never appeared to so much\r\nadvantage as in Canada, where their energies had been fully called forth\r\nand developed by the new circumstances in which they were placed, and\r\ntheir exertions induced me to regard many of them as heroines. Emigrants\r\nare desired to bring out wives to Canada, and I add my testimony to the\r\njustness of the recommendation. In almost every case that came under\r\nnotice, my countrywomen appeared calculated to stimulate their husbands\r\nto industrious exertion, and some, under divine Providence, Seemed to\r\nowe almost all they possessed to their fair partners.\r\n\r\nOne great source of rejoicing to Mrs T—— was her husband’s improved\r\nstate of health since his arrival in Canada, which she attributed to\r\nclimate. But were I to judge of the matter, I would assign his change of\r\ncircumstances as the more likely cause of his better health. Land in\r\nScotland is almost always occupied on lease of 19 years’ endurance, and\r\nperhaps there is no situation more trying than a tenant with an\r\nover-rented farm. In nine cases out of ten he cannot get quit of his\r\nlease, or a modification of rent; if he rise early or toil late, the\r\nfruits of his labour go to the proprietor of the land, and year after\r\nyear he finds his funds diminishing, with ultimate ruin in prospective.\r\nUnder such circumstances I have known individuals become drunkards,\r\nothers gamblers; some have sunk into a premature grave, and but few\r\nminds remain in full tone, and still fewer constitutions. To escape from\r\nsuch a situation, and reach Canada, where the present may be said to be\r\nwithout care, and futurity so brilliant, must be a perfect Elysium and\r\nrestorer of health. It is but justice for me to say, that I am\r\naltogether unacquainted with the circumstances in which Mr T—— was\r\nsituated in Scotland, but if like many of his profession, his improved\r\nhealth may be regarded as an effect of his improved prospects.\r\n\r\nWe reached Captain A——’s, in the township of Blenheim, in time for\r\ndinner, having passed through miles of forests, in which a track could\r\nscarcely be recognised. The general appearance of the place had an air\r\nof neatness, although it was only fifteen months since the first tree\r\nwas felled. He had already cleared about 30 acres, and reaped a\r\nluxuriant, though mildewed, wheat crop. Oats, potatoes, and Indian corn,\r\nwere advancing towards maturity. Here, for the first time in Canada, I\r\nsaw crops injured from luxuriance, and only two or three instances of\r\nsuch afterwards came under my notice.\r\n\r\nThe residence of Captain A—— was within 50 yards of a rivulet which\r\njoined the Nith, the space between the house and the stream being\r\noccupied as a garden, in which the taste of the family had begun to be\r\ndisplayed in cultivating flowers. The house was a log cottage of\r\nconsiderable dimensions, one longitudinal half of which was occupied by\r\na kitchen and sitting room; the other half consisted of sleeping\r\napartments, which I did not number. The door opened into the kitchen, in\r\nwhich every thing was clean and neat, and which communicated with the\r\nrest of the house. The interior walls consisted of unbarked trees,\r\nagainst which an extensive library was placed, occupying one end of the\r\nsitting room. When retiring for the night, we were conducted up a stair\r\ninto a kind of garret, where we were told we must sleep. At this time I\r\nhad not seen much Backwood life, and my looks, perhaps, betraying\r\nastonishment, Captain A—— laughed heartily, and reconducted us to an\r\napartment below, where I reposed for the night, on a more comfortable\r\nbed than any I afterwards met with in America.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I arose before any of the family, and while walking up the\r\nbanks of the stream, ere the sun had peeped over the forest, enjoyed an\r\nexcellent opportunity of observing the humming-bird of the country.\r\nUpwards of a dozen of these lovely creatures were feeding on the\r\nblossoms of a plant growing near the river, the celerity of their\r\nmovements in examining and passing from flower to flower excited\r\nadmiration, and when moving to a distance, the eye could not follow\r\ntheir rapidity of flight. A copious formation of dew had taken place in\r\ncourse of the night, which draggled their beautiful plumage in\r\nfluttering amongst the leaves, and they frequently retired to a fallen\r\ntree to trim their feathers. They seemed regardless of my presence, and\r\nplied their task within a few yards of me. They do not, like the bee,\r\nrest on a plant when examining a flower, but thrust their long bill into\r\nthe heart of the blossom when suspended in air, and in this position\r\nexcite the noise from which they take their name.\r\n\r\nCaptain A——’s family consisted of eleven children, the eldest of whom\r\nseemed about seventeen years. He had moved in the best society of\r\nLondon, and in consequence of a sudden reverse of fortune, came to his\r\npresent situation, and at once placed his family in the bush, without a\r\nservant or any one to assist them, and they bake, cook, wash, and do\r\nevery thing for themselves. Mrs A—— is a sensible woman, reconciled to\r\nher situation; and her household and family matters testify to her\r\nexcellent management. Two sons, handsome, genteel-looking youths, about\r\nfifteen or sixteen years of age, chop trees, and perform all sort of\r\nfarm work. The young ladies seem equally active in their department. I\r\nwas anxious to see the cows milked, but unfortunately they had strayed\r\nin the woods, and could not be found while I was there. It requires a\r\nconsiderable degree of heroism in people like Captain and Mrs A——,\r\naccustomed to the gaieties and luxuries of London life, retiring to the\r\nwoods of Canada without a servant or any thing like their former notions\r\nof comfort, and whatever may have been the impelling motive for the step\r\nthey took, their perseverance merits applause. It was an interesting\r\nsight to see a young and genteel family so situated and happy in their\r\nnew position, and the pleasure experienced during my visit at Lamotte,\r\nwas an ample recompense for crossing the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIn my progress through Canada I had witnessed female devotion of the\r\nmost exalted character, which circumstances prevent me noticing, but the\r\nsame reasons do not apply to the youths of this family, and I trust they\r\nwill pardon the liberty I take with them. Two slender and accomplished\r\nboys, in a part of the world blighting to their first budding hopes and\r\nenjoyments, inuring themselves to the hardest manual labour in support\r\nof their parents, and infant brothers and sisters, is a picture of\r\ndisinterested virtue worthy of being delineated by an abler pen. I trust\r\ntheir exertions will be crowned with success, and that a portion of\r\ntime, which can be spared from furnishing food, will be devoted to the\r\nmoral improvement of the younger branches of the family. What a source\r\nof comfort these youths must be to their parents, whose precepts must\r\nhave had no small share in forming their character, and their conduct\r\nmay be instanced as illustrative of the advantages of parental care, in\r\na selfish point of view, where nobler motives do not exist. Their mode\r\nof life may be different from that of their schoolfellows in England,\r\nbut in mature age they will look back with delight on their past\r\nlabours, and in all probability, great will be their reward in this\r\nlife, and greater in that which is to come.\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of breakfast, we bade adieu to Lamotte, when the little\r\nmembers of the family clustering around, reminded me of the\r\nhumming-birds seen in the morning, and I could not refrain from stealing\r\na kiss from a curly-headed child, whose soft blue eyes were innocently\r\nfixed on the departing strangers. On our way to the Goderich road, we\r\nwere accompanied by Mr T. A——, mounted on horseback, with an axe over\r\nhis shoulder, to act as guide, and cut a way for the waggon. As he rode\r\nbefore us, with his slender figure dressed in a clean neat jacket and\r\ntrowsers, snow-white shirt, with exposed collar and broad-brimmed straw\r\nhat, I would at one period have thought him ill-adapted for a\r\nBackwoodsman, but having, in course of my wanderings in the wilds of\r\nCanada, witnessed the advantages of cultivated minds and habits, his\r\nappearance was a source of pleasure, while I meditated on his probable\r\ncareer in life. We fortunately did not require much of his axe services,\r\nand parted with him at the end of five or six miles, where the road was\r\ngood. About two miles farther, the road seemed to terminate at a\r\nlog-hut, the inmate of which told us a waggon had never penetrated\r\nbeyond his dwelling, and would have difficulty in reaching the Goderich\r\nroad, distant four miles. He offered to be our guide, and provided\r\nhimself with an axe to clear the way. We had before this time commenced\r\nwalking, from the badness of the roads, and found considerable\r\ndifficulty in getting the waggon through the bush, when at length its\r\nprogress was arrested. In this dilemma a person approached, and said it\r\nwas impossible to proceed in our present route, and offered to show us\r\nthrough the only passage. We were conducted many miles of footpath, till\r\nwe at last reached the wished-for road. I felt pleased with our bush\r\nguides, one of whom was from Yorkshire, the other from Ireland; they did\r\nnot take advantage of our situation by stipulating for reward, but\r\nseemed to act alone from friendship, and I bestowed on each a trifling\r\ngratuity.\r\n\r\nWe dined at a tavern on Smith’s Creek, newly erected, good of its kind,\r\nand a little after nightfall reached one on Avon Creek kept by an\r\nintelligent Irishman. On retiring for the night, we were conducted to a\r\nshanty thirty or forty yards from the tavern, consisting of one\r\napartment, containing three beds, one of which was already occupied,\r\nanother was destined for our waggoner, and the third for my friend and\r\nself. This hovel did not even contain a seat, or any kind of furniture,\r\nexcept the fore-mentioned beds, and the door was without a fastening;\r\nthe roof was of bark, and the rays of the moon shone through it and the\r\nsides of the building, which bore a stronger resemblance to a bird-cage\r\nthan a human habitation. The beds were boughs of trees, put together in\r\nthe manner of a camp stool, with a netting of bark connecting the\r\nframe-work. The feeble glimmer of a small candle fixed near the door,\r\nprevented me seeing the bed-clothes, but the bed felt as rough and hard\r\nas the corduroy roads over which we had travelled in course of the day.\r\nOn lying down for the night, the farmer’s saying to Mr T. A——, this is a\r\nrough country for a gentleman, recurred to my memory; and in a few\r\nminutes the chirping of a thousand crickets lulled me to repose.\r\n\r\nNext morning I called our waggoner at daybreak, and, while the horses\r\nwere attaching, examined a grist and saw mill which were erecting by the\r\nriver side. We breakfasted on very poor fare at a tavern kept by a\r\nGerman, who was one of the first settlers on the road, having been five\r\nyears in his present situation. He expressed himself satisfied with his\r\nlot, having 1000 acres of land, and had only sixteen in his own country.\r\nI remarked that he perhaps held too much land; when he told me he had\r\nnine sons, to each of whom he meant to give 100 acres, and retain the\r\nsame extent for himself. His wheat crop this year consisted of sixteen\r\nacres, and was almost entirely destroyed by mildew. We dined at Van\r\nEgmont’s tavern, which is a wealthy-looking place for the country,\r\ncontaining a store of miscellaneous goods, large barns, and a tolerably\r\ngood garden. We travelled five or six miles after nightfall to Goderich.\r\n\r\nFrom Smith’s Creek to Goderich, a distance of about sixty miles, nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the road is corduroy or crossway. Occasionally a tree has\r\nbeen left standing in the centre of the road, as if for the purpose of\r\nattracting notice. These trees are generally rock-elm of the finest\r\ndescription, but as others equally good could be found a few yards from\r\nthe road, those on its centre ought to be removed as interruptions.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Captain A——’s farm in Blenheim is a rich soft loam of easy\r\ncultivation. The land of this township, and the adjoining one, Wilmot,\r\nwhich we passed through, is loam of excellent quality. The wood is\r\nchiefly maple, interspersed with elm, oak, cherry, and beach. On our way\r\nfrom Lamotte to the Goderich road, we saw what is called a wind-fall in\r\nthe forest, or havoc of a whirlwind, where the decaying trunks of trees\r\nwere scattered in wild and mutilated confusion. Many single trees were\r\nlying up and down, with large masses of earth raised by, and adhering\r\nto, the roots, termed cradle-knolls, which, in some places, were so\r\nnumerous as to resemble graves in a churchyard. The soil in the township\r\nof East and North Hope seems considerably inferior to that of the two\r\nmentioned, and a great deal of bad land is afterwards met with,\r\nconsisting of swamp and wet clay, covered with stunted wood of various\r\nkinds, and partially settled by poor looking people, lodged in miserable\r\nhovels. I was grieved to see human beings had set themselves down on bad\r\nsoil, while so much of good quality remained unoccupied, and which would\r\nhave better rewarded them for the labour of clearing. It is perhaps the\r\npolicy of some to fix settlers on bad soil, in the first instance, as\r\nthe good will be sure to attract others. One person told me, with\r\nseeming self-satisfaction, that his consisted of an inch or two of black\r\nmould on top and fine white clay below.\r\n\r\nChess was plentiful in all situations on the Goderich road; timothy the\r\nprevailing grass, a few plants of cocksfoot, with narrow leaves, and\r\nwhite clover, were occasionally seen.\r\n\r\nA deer was observed standing on the road for some time, at no great\r\ndistance from the waggon, and suddenly bounded off into the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  _Goderich Hotels—Eagle’s Nest—Doctor Dunlop—Cheap Dinner—Search for an\r\n    East Lothian Farmer—Goderich—Poverty of Settlers—Canada\r\n    Company—State of Goderich Settlement—Journey to London—Mr T***—Aux\r\n    Sable Creek—Ship-builder from Essex—Negro Settlement—Notices of\r\n    Nature—Robinson Hotel—Mode of Travelling—Huron Track Roads—London—St\r\n    Thomas—Port Stanley—Emigrants from Argyleshire—Dirty\r\n    Beds—Agricultural Notices._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Goderich, we could not get admittance to Reid’s hotel,\r\nunless my friend and I would occupy half a bed, which induced us to\r\ndrive to that of Mr Fisher, where we slept uncomfortably on the floor,\r\nthe landlady telling us, while preparing the pallet, that Goderich was a\r\npoor place. While partaking of tea, served up after the fashion of the\r\nStates, I imagined the sugar had been put into the pot, as there was\r\nnone visible in the apartment, but next morning I discovered it was\r\nmixed with the cream. Fisher’s hotel was crowded with workmen of all\r\ndescriptions, and by way of kindness, I suppose, we were invited to\r\nbreakfast with the family. My shoes had long remained uncleaned, and I\r\ngot them blackened here by paying 3d. sterling, which was unprofitably\r\nspent money, as a few minutes’ walking in dewy grass rendered them as\r\nbrown as before.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we walked in the direction of Dr Dunlop’s new cottage,\r\non the north side of the river Maitland, and named the Eagle’s Nest. The\r\nsituation seems happily chosen, and the name is characteristic of the\r\nowner. We spent a considerable time in examining the vegetable\r\nproductions of the large islands formed by the river, which, at the time\r\nwe saw it, was a mere brook, until overtaken by a shower, which\r\ncompelled us to return to Goderich without reaching the Nest. I\r\nunderstood the islands at the mouth of the Maitland and the adjoining\r\nbanks, had been granted as a common to the inhabitants of Goderich. The\r\ngrass was very limited in quantity as well as variety of species, but\r\ntall growing weeds of great beauty covered the surface. I do not know\r\nwhether these plants flavoured dairy produce; but the butter we got at\r\nGoderich was so nauseous, that neither my friend nor I could eat this\r\nsubstance for some days afterwards. The butter of Upper Canada was\r\ngenerally of the worst quality.\r\n\r\nOn returning from our walk we called on Dr Dunlop, at the office of the\r\nCanada Company, who introduced us to his brother the captain, recently\r\narrived in the country. I had been furnished with an introductory letter\r\nto the Doctor, from a _well-known character_, both in Scotland and\r\nCanada, and which I left with Mr Jones at York. The Doctor seemed busy,\r\nand our conversation was limited, which I did not much regret, as I\r\nvisited America with a determination to judge of matters more from what\r\nI saw than what might be told me, and there appeared nothing in the\r\ncircumstances of the Goderich settlement requiring much explanation.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Fisher’s establishment did not appear of the first order, we\r\ndetermined on dining at the principal hotel, where we were admitted to\r\nwhat Mr Reid termed a family dinner. The table seemed surrounded by all\r\nthe inmates of the houses twelve or fourteen in number, including\r\nboarders and travellers of all descriptions. Mr Reid presided, and\r\namused me by distributing a tureen full of Scotch broth, with a tea-cup\r\nfor a divider, and from the shortness of the handle, his fingers were\r\nimmersed in stirring up the liquid. The entertainment was poor enough,\r\nand cost the moderate sum of sixpence sterling.\r\n\r\nHaving promised, on parting at Montreal with Mr D——, to endeavour to\r\nvisit, if possible, a friend of his in the neighbourhood of Goderich,\r\nwho once farmed in one of the finest situations in East Lothian, I felt\r\nanxious to witness the proceedings of an East Lothian farmer in so new a\r\nsettlement as this; and immediately after dinner set out in search of Mr\r\nK——, who, we were told, lived about four miles from Goderich, on the\r\nshores of Lake Huron. We at first attempted to walk along the margin of\r\nthe lake; but the quantity of drift and fallen timber which lined the\r\nshore, joined to the surge which was rushing from the west with the\r\nviolence of a tempestuous ocean, rendered this route impracticable. On\r\nregaining the banks above the lake, I approached a cottage, and enquired\r\nthe way. A young gentleman asked me to walk into his house, and he would\r\nfurnish a hand-sketch of the road. He was employed in mapping for the\r\nCanada Company, and his productions did him credit. He told me he was\r\nfrom Edinburgh, and brother to ——, a well-known engraver there, and\r\nwhose name was quite familiar to me. On enquiring the way a second time,\r\na mile or two farther on, I was astonished at a gentleman mentioning my\r\nname, when he said he had seen me in Edinburgh, where he was a\r\nbrassfounder in the Grassmarket, and had only been a few weeks is the\r\ncountry. Notwithstanding the assistance of a sketch of the road, and\r\nminute directions received regarding it, we could not find the object of\r\nour search, and must have passed the night in the woods, had not the\r\nlight of the moon, which was fortunately within a night of being full,\r\nenabled us to reach Goderich. The road on which we travelled is termed a\r\nconcession line, and was marked by a blaze or axe-chip on the bark of\r\ntrees. From this concession line, the different lots of property\r\ndiverged, and were distinguished by marks which old countrymen could not\r\nreadily notice; and I have no doubt we passed over the property of Mr\r\nK——, without discovering the tract leading to his abode. The concession\r\nline, a mile from Goderich, was almost an undistinguishable path, on\r\nwhich a horse or sleigh seemed never to have travelled. The cleared\r\nspaces on the different lots seldom exceed a few acres; and while\r\nconversing with my friend, I compared our route through the forest to a\r\nhare-path in an East Lothian wheat field, and the openings around the\r\ndwelling places to the forms of that animal.\r\n\r\nGoderich is situated on the margin of Lake Huron, at the mouth of the\r\nriver Maitland, and consists of about forty mean wooden houses,\r\nscattered irregularly over a considerable space. With exception of\r\nhalf-a-dozen of houses, near what is termed the pier, the rest of the\r\nvillage is about 200 feet above the level of the lake, partly on a cedar\r\nswamp, through which there is a street of corduroy. The Maitland river,\r\nwhen seen by me, on 28th August, was incapable of floating a canoe, and\r\na vessel, a few tons burden, could not enter the mouth of the harbour.\r\n\r\nI found the Canada Company very unpopular at Goderich, although Dr\r\nDunlop is a favourite amongst the settlers, who are of the poorest\r\nclass, and seemingly without industry or energy of any kind. Indeed,\r\nwhen men despair of overcoming their pecuniary difficulties, which must\r\nhave been the case with most of the first settlers, they are apt to\r\nbecome both indolent and dissipated. The Canada Company charge 7s. 6d.\r\nper acre for land, payable, with interest, by instalments; and when a\r\nspecified extent is taken, part of the settler’s travelling expenses are\r\nallowed him out of the second instalment. This is a most disadvantageous\r\nregulation for emigrants, being a premium to purchase beyond their means\r\nof paying, and an unprofitable locking up, or perhaps rather transfer of\r\ncapital, which cannot by possibility fail of ending in ruin, as it hath\r\nbeen proved by the whole history of American wood settlers, that they\r\nfind it difficult, for the first three years, with the utmost industry,\r\nto do more than maintain their families. In this case, the interest on\r\nthe unpaid instalments is more than the cleared part of the farm will\r\nyield of profit at the end of five or six years, where a person trusts\r\nalone to his personal labour for improving. When all the instalments are\r\nduly paid, the price of the forest land, which seldom yields a blade of\r\ngrass, and is totally unproductive, remains an overwhelming burden on\r\nwhat is cleared. Dr Dunlop told me, that only one of the original\r\nsettlers continued to hold his land at the time of my visit to Goderich,\r\nand alluded to a cause for their removal, which I did not think likely\r\nto have produced the effect. The first settlers at Goderich were people\r\nof limited means, the majority of them paupers, and they soon became so\r\ninvolved to the Company, as to induce them to leave the district. Many\r\nof the recent purchasers, perhaps forty or fifty of them, were working\r\non the Company’s roads while I was present, which the Doctor told me was\r\nthe only means by which they could render payment.\r\n\r\nIt seem bad policy in a nation overflowing with population to sell a\r\nlarge though distant tract of land to speculators, like the Canada\r\nCompany, who must seek immediate gain, without regard to the ultimate\r\nwelfare of settlers, and only pursue revenue without aiming to develope\r\nthe permanent resources of the district. Such an extent of territory as\r\nthe Canada company possess, gives a monopoly of land, and a power of\r\nenhancing price, operating on the emigrant as a tax, which is\r\ntransferred to the shareholders in England, instead of being employed on\r\nthe spot. The affairs of the Company are not likely to be soon wound up,\r\nas the lands of insolvent purchasers will, from time to time, return to\r\nits management, and the price of land will be raised beyond the demands\r\nof the population, as well as let on lease. The political power of the\r\nCompany will soon be felt, and its minions thrust into the legislature\r\nof the country, to the retarding of every local improvement affecting\r\nthe finances of the Company. The shareholders will ultimately occupy the\r\nposition of absentee landlords, and become the most avaricious of\r\ntaskmasters.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement in the Huron tract having been made in 1829, it\r\nwould be unreasonable to expect any thing like luxury or old-country\r\ncomfort in the neighbourhood of Goderich. The habitations of the farmer\r\nare generally of the meanest description, and often quite equal in\r\nwretchedness to the worst hovels of Ireland and Scotland, and perhaps\r\nthe notions of many of the settlers lead them to desire no better\r\naccommodation. It has already been noticed, that only one of the\r\noriginal farmers retains his possessions, and their successors are an\r\nimproved race. A change proceeding in this manner may have benefited\r\nsociety, but at present there is a coarse rawness about men and things\r\nat Goderich which I felt far from being agreeable.\r\n\r\nWe left Goderich at seven in the morning of the 28th of August, and\r\nabout seventeen miles distant, met Mr T—— and his friends journeying to\r\nGoderich, and resting on the wayside till their horse had fed, and I\r\nenjoyed highly a piece of bread which he presented to me. This gentleman\r\nhad one of his horses stolen by an Indian the night preceding, and which\r\nwas seen by us grazing with a halter on its head a few miles distant. I\r\nhad become acquainted with Mr T—— in travelling from Montreal to York,\r\nand we regretted missing him at Goderich, where his local knowledge,\r\njoined to his sound sense, would have rendered him a most desirable\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nIt had rained pretty heavily in the afternoon, and we reached an inn at\r\nAux Sable creek, hungry and wet. In a miserable log-house of two\r\napartments, ten travellers passed the night, partly in beds and partly\r\non the floor. The door was a collection of open boards, and the walls\r\nand roof admitted air and light in all directions. The bed which I\r\noccupied, in common with my friend, was hard and uneven, and I arose\r\nfrom it unrefreshed. The morning was so cold that I could hardly warm\r\nmyself by walking, and the rays of a cloudless sun were courted for\r\nwarmth at midday. After travelling nearly seven hours we made seventeen\r\nmiles, at the end of which I enjoyed the company of an old Irishwoman,\r\ncooking pork, potatoes, apples, and tea to breakfast, for a party which\r\nhad travelled together from Aux Sable creek. This old lady and her\r\nhusband had been thirteen years on a farm of 150 acres, eighty of which\r\nwere cleared, and every thing around them looked comfortable. I joined\r\ntwo reapers, and cut a few sheaves in a very fine field of oats, which I\r\nwas told had been cropped for twelve successive years without an\r\napplication of manure. After resting the horses, we proceeded on our\r\njourney to London.\r\n\r\nAbout noon of the preceding day, I had some conversation with a\r\nship-builder from Essex, in England, settled on the London road in the\r\nHuron tract, and at whose dwelling I made an unsuccessful application\r\nfor something to eat. Like most settlers, he was full of hope, and\r\nextolled the fertility of his soil. On remarking to him that his wheat\r\ncrop, which had been sown in spring, was destroyed by mildew, he\r\nreluctantly admitted the fact, and added that he was assured mildew did\r\nnot visit the district above once in twenty years; not perhaps being\r\naware that I knew the district had only been inhabited three or four\r\nyears, and not even visited by a white person more than six years\r\nprevious to the time of our conversation. Some of this person’s family\r\nhad a sickly appearance, and on questioning him if any of them ever had\r\nague, he told me several caught the complaint while residing at\r\nHamilton, on Lake Ontario, but it was quite unknown in his present\r\nsituation. I record these anecdotes as two of the thousand instances\r\nwhich occurred, of settlers lessening the evils, or rather magnifying\r\nthe advantages, of their situation, and how necessary it is to sift, by\r\nreflection, the grain from the chaff of common conversation.\r\n\r\nOn the boundary of the Huron tract, next to the London district, we\r\npassed a negro settlement. The houses of the coloured people appeared of\r\na particular construction, having the chimney-stack on the outside of\r\nthe log-house, and which stack is composed of thin sawn timber, placed\r\nhorizontally, and mixed with clay. Their chief crop was Indian corn,\r\nwell cultivated. Before my departure from Britain, I had heard this\r\nsettlement instanced as a complete failure, and used as an argument\r\nagainst the emancipation of slaves, then a general topic of\r\nconversation. The houses, barns, fences, and general appearances of this\r\nsettlement are certainly mean enough, but I considered it in most\r\nrespects equal, and in some superior, to settlements of whites in the\r\nHuron tract of the same standing of three years. But admitting, for\r\nargument’s sake, that this negro settlement had been a failure, the\r\ncircumstance could not form a good reason of expediency against\r\nemancipation generally. When individuals attain maturity in a state of\r\nslavery, they will become so demoralized as to be incapable of acting\r\nwith the feelings and aspirations of freemen and moral agents, and it is\r\nthe rising and not the risen generation that much improvement is to be\r\nexpected from. Perhaps the neglected and depressed state in which the\r\npoor Irish are reared in their native country is the chief cause of\r\ntheir making improvident settlers in Canada, and continuing hewers of\r\nwood and carriers of water over so great a portion of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe land in the Huron tract is truly excellent, with exception of a few\r\nmiles around Goderich, which is sandy or gravelly, and some small cedar,\r\nash, and larch swamps, being fine clay with a covering of black\r\nvegetable mould. The soil on the road leading from Van Egmont’s tavern\r\nto London, is particularly fine clay, especially near the Bayfield\r\nriver, and the whole surface is perfectly level, with exception of the\r\nmargins of the creeks. The London district is gently undulating, the\r\nsoil greatly inferior to the Huron tract, and near the village becomes\r\nbarren sand.\r\n\r\nThe wood on the road from Goderich to London is chiefly maple,\r\ninterspersed with beech and elm, the latter being of considerable size.\r\nWhite clover is seldom seen on the waysides, red never, timothy\r\nplentiful, and a few plants of cocksfoot. Alder was growing in every\r\nplace where the forest had been cut down, and put forth shoots of\r\nuncommon luxuriance, which seemed to die yearly, as I never observed a\r\ntrunk or branch of a former year’s growth. The species appeared the same\r\nas that common in Britain, and perhaps the young shoots cannot withstand\r\nthe rigours of a Canadian winter.\r\n\r\nI observed a wasp-nest in the ground on the Goderich road, where swarms\r\nof the insects were passing out and in. They appeared similar to the\r\nwasp of Britain; but my friend was not philosopher enough to be\r\nprevailed on to try their stinging powers.\r\n\r\nOn reaching London we stopped at the Robinson hotel, christened a few\r\ndays previous to our arrival, in compliment to the chief justice of the\r\nprovince, who had honoured the house by his presence while on the\r\ncircuit. The landlord told us the dinner was over, but that he would\r\nprepare something for us immediately. In the meantime we retired to\r\nwash, and at the end of an hour and a half discovered it was intended to\r\nput off our eating till the arrival of tea hour. We had been treated in\r\nthe same manner at Brantford; and after remonstrating with the landlord\r\non the impropriety of promising dinner without furnishing it, we removed\r\nto the Mansion House hotel, where we experienced civility and attention.\r\n\r\nThis evening we parted with our waggoner, Francis Packet, who had\r\nbrought us from Brantford. Unlike his countrymen, he possessed little\r\nwit or humour, but he was very good-natured, strictly sober,\r\naccommodating, and an excellent driver. He seemed disposed to accompany\r\nus throughout the remainder of our tour, and I confidently recommend him\r\nand his chestnut horses, John and Charlie, to all who may require their\r\nservices. Francis was seldom disposed to talk much, but he invariably\r\naccosted every person on the road, by saying, in broken English, “How\r\nfar tavern?”\r\n\r\nAt Brantford we engaged a waggon in preference to horses, under an idea\r\nof its being an easier mode of conveyance, but I am now satisfied our\r\nopinion was erroneous, as horseback would have been more expeditious,\r\nand less fatiguing than our waggon, over such roads as we travelled. The\r\nroads formed by the Canada Company in the Huron tract have been styled\r\ngood by the Backwoodsmen, and so puffed off in every British newspaper,\r\nthat Englishmen may be apt to imagine they are Macadamized. They are\r\nsimply straight lines, formed by felling trees, the branches and trunks\r\nof which have been burnt, or formed into corduroy, and the stumps, from\r\ntwo to three feet in height, left standing. I have already alluded to\r\nthe extent of corduroy, a description of roads which most travellers\r\nspeak of with horror, and, without meaning to praise it, I must say it\r\nwas by far the best and smoothest portions of the Goderich roads. The\r\nroots projecting from the stumps in a slanting direction kept the wheels\r\nand axles of our waggon moving up and down with the regularity of the\r\nbeam of a steam-engine, and were alike annoying to us, and fatiguing to\r\nthe horses, and more especially when travelling between Van Egmont’s\r\ntavern and London. In the neighbourhood of Goderich people were engaged\r\nin burning out the stumps, and throwing the earth from the sides into\r\nthe middle of the road, giving it a convex form, which, in American\r\nphraseology, is called turnpiking, and this operation will be extended\r\nin time, if settlers have not cash to discharge their engagements to the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nLondon is situated at what is termed the Forks of the Thames, and when\r\nthe forest is a little more cleared away than at present, few situations\r\nwill be accounted more beautiful. At present a number of houses are\r\nbeing erected, and the village is rising rapidly into importance. It\r\ncontains three or four large hotels, many well-filled stores, and a\r\ncourt house, of which the inhabitants feel proud.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th August we left London for St Thomas and Port Stanley, in a\r\nwaggon belonging to St Thomas, and enjoyed our drive after the jolting\r\nsnail pace we had experienced on the horrid roads of the Huron tract.\r\nDining at St Thomas, we walked to Port Stanley, where we remained for\r\nthe night. Next morning we returned to St Thomas, in the midst of a\r\nheavy ran, which confined us to the house for the greater part of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nSt Thomas seems healthily situated on a bend of Kettle creek, about 200\r\nfeet above its waters. Three years ago it consisted of thirteen houses,\r\nnow there are about fifty. Mr Gregory, at whose hotel we stopt, then had\r\nfour beds, now he has twenty-five, and is engaged in enlarging his house\r\nto twice its present size. There are other two good hotels in the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nPort Stanley is situated at the mouth of Kettle creek, and has a\r\ntolerably good harbour, formed by wooden piers jutting into the lake.\r\nThis is almost the only port at present on the north side of Lake Erie,\r\nand from its proximity to London and St Thomas, its trade will greatly\r\nincrease. A steam-boat commenced this season to ply regularly from\r\nBuffalo, by which a number of British emigrants reach the London\r\ndistrict by way of New York and the Erie Canal. Steam-boats also touch\r\nin passing from Chippaway to Sandwich and Chatham.\r\n\r\nKettle creek is a small stream running in a deep channel, the banks\r\nbeing clay, and nearly 200 feet high at its mouth on the shores of the\r\nlake, from the bosom of which we saw the moon rise majestically, while\r\nexamining the banks. On Kettle creek there is a carding, grist, and\r\nsaw-mill, a distillery and brewery, situated between St Thomas and Port\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\nAt Port Stanley I conversed with a party of emigrants encamped on the\r\nwharf, from Argyleshire, Scotland, who had come by way of New York, and\r\nseemed in comfortable circumstances. The males of the party had gone\r\ninto the country in search of relations, who had settled some years\r\nbefore, and the females were anxiously looking for their return. Several\r\nwomen, apparently on the verge of seventy years of age, and infant\r\nchildren, were amongst the number. A middle-aged woman complained to me\r\nof the dirtiness of the beds at Port Stanley, and the extravagance of\r\nthe charges. On the preceding night she had been charged 1s. for a bed.\r\nWater to wash her children’s faces could not be obtained, and the party\r\npreferred lying in the open air to the nasty beds. This was a sensible\r\nand well-informed woman, although she had not got quit of her home\r\nprejudices in some little matters. The difficulty of obtaining water to\r\nwash her children might soon have been got over, by going for it herself\r\nto the lake or creek, neither of which were seventy yards distant; and\r\nif a vessel for holding water had been denied her, she might have taken\r\nthe children to the water. People brought up in an artificial state of\r\nsociety must often wonder at their own helplessness on first arriving in\r\nCanada. I quite agree with my countrywoman in the dirtiness of the beds\r\nin some parts of western Canada. My friend C—— much oftener slept on the\r\nfloor than in the beds; but long before this time my notions of delicacy\r\nin this respect had been overcome by reflection, if not blunted by\r\nhabit, and I reposed as soundly while in Canada, as ever I did in the\r\nmost luxurious night of my life.\r\n\r\nThe surface between the village of London and Lake Erie is undulating,\r\nvarying from clay to sand, and a very small portion can be termed rich.\r\nThree miles from Port Stanley the soil is oak openings of the poorest\r\nsand. There is a scarcity of running water, Kettle Creek being the only\r\ninstance seen in a distance of thirty miles. Many orchards are to be met\r\nwith, and soil and climate seem highly congenial to the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nThe settlers on what is known by Talbot road, running through St Thomas,\r\nand at no great distance from Lake Erie, live in mean log-houses, with\r\nmiserable barns and fences. The clearances extend from thirty to sixty\r\nacres, and improvement of every description seems at a stand amongst\r\nthem. Labourers’ wages were stated at $120 a-year, with bed and board.\r\nWheat, crop 1832, was 2s. 9d. cash, and 3s. sterling, store-pay, per\r\nbushel. Mr Gregory told me he had purchased good wheat at St Thomas at\r\n1s. 9d. per bushel, and it has been known as low as 1s. sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Talbot’s residence—Camp-meeting—Barn—Mrs Aldgeo—Moravian\r\n    Indian village—Cheap fruit—Runaway slaves—Excursion to Bear\r\n    Creek—Mr Goose—Soil—Agricultural Notices—River Thames—Unhealthy\r\n    appearance of inhabitants—Chatham—Plains—John Macdonald—Colborne\r\n    Furnace—Neighbourhood of Amherstburgh—French inn._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn travelling from London to St Thomas, we were told of a Methodist\r\ncamp-meeting in the neighbourhood; and as I had long been anxious to see\r\none, we agreed to attend on the Sunday, when the meeting would be\r\nfullest. Early in the morning, people, in waggons and on horseback, were\r\nstreaming in crowds through St Thomas towards the meeting, and as I was\r\nafraid of losing patience before evening, when the richest scene is said\r\nto take place, we embraced an offer of going to Colonel Talbot’s in the\r\nforenoon, distant about twelve miles west from St Thomas. The colonel’s\r\nresidence may be described as a cluster of mean wooden buildings,\r\nconsisting of dwelling-houses, stables, barns, pigstyes, and\r\ncattle-shades, constructed and placed seemingly without regard either to\r\nconvenience or effect, commanding a view of Lake Erie, from which it is\r\ndistant about 200 yards, and at the mouth of Ottar creek, a small brook,\r\nwith clay banks of considerable height. The clay banks behind the\r\ncolonel’s house have a barren and naked appearance, while the lake in\r\nfront is too near. The situation, nevertheless, has capabilities to make\r\na fine place, when taste shall build a habitation. The garden, which was\r\nbadly kept, contained some fine apple and pear trees, which we viewed\r\nfrom the outside of the fence. There were a few weeping willows, the\r\nfirst I saw in Canada, and which raised the colonel considerably in my\r\nestimation, as they are not, I believe, indigenous to the country.\r\n\r\nThe cleared ground may extend to about 200 acres, and is partly clay and\r\npartly sand. The fences and general appearance of the place seem to mark\r\nthe Colonel as an indifferent manager, both with regard to neatness and\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nOn the creek there is a site of a mill, which was burnt down by the\r\nYankees during the war, and which remains unrepaired. The colonel is\r\nsaid to have narrowly escaped being captured at this time, by a party of\r\nAmericans, who came intentionally to take him prisoner. The colonel, at\r\nthe time of their arrival, happened, it is said, to be occupied in\r\nmilking cows in the fields, and thereby escaped detection till he\r\nreached the woods.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention at one time to have introduced myself to the\r\ncolonel, who was observed standing at his door, when we were only a few\r\nhundred yards distant; but the accounts received in the neighbourhood\r\ninduced me to think there was very little chance of our interview being\r\nattended with pleasure, and I withdrew without making his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nWe returned to St Thomas, which we left at half-past four, in a waggon,\r\nfor the camp-meeting, and on our way met multitudes of people on their\r\nreturn home. It now became evident we had been too late in visiting the\r\nmeeting, to see the greatest assemblage, but consoled ourselves that the\r\nmost fervent worshippers would be more readily distinguished. Our waggon\r\nwas left within a mile of the meeting, and we proceeded on foot through\r\nthe forest. The ground in the midst of the forest had been prepared for\r\nthe occasion, having had the brush or underwood removed, and trees laid\r\nin parallel rows, by way of seats, for five or six hundred people. On\r\nentering a square, formed by tents, in which the people reside for four\r\nor five days together, I was disappointed at the smallness of the\r\nassemblage, which did not exceed three hundred souls. Many people were\r\nwalking up and down, engaged in mirthful conversation, and five or six\r\nsmall groups were standing in different parts, singing hymns in a low\r\ntone. At this moment I observed a comely young woman in front of a tent,\r\nlaughing and nodding familiarly to a numerous acquaintance, which\r\ninduced me to think she might be engaged in attending a tent for\r\nentertaining the company. She bore a striking likeness to a valued\r\nfriend in Scotland; and while engaged in tracing the resemblance,\r\nfeature by feature, she and a younger companion jumped into a waggon,\r\nand seated themselves in a conspicuous situation, as if wishing to\r\nattract attention. On walking round the square, I was riveted to the\r\nspot by the sweetness of a young lady’s voice, dressed in white, with a\r\nvery broad gipsy straw-bonnet, and black veil hanging over her shoulder.\r\nHer figure was above the middle size, slender and graceful, her features\r\nexpressive and handsome. She was accompanied by another lady, wearing a\r\nbonnet and veil of the same description, and a gentleman, seemingly her\r\nsister and brother, and all were engaged in singing. From the appearance\r\nof things, I concluded the people had a short time before been engaged\r\nin taking tea.\r\n\r\nA little while after entering the square, five or six old men placed\r\nthemselves in front of a rude platform erected for the preachers, and\r\ncommenced singing in a loud strain, on hearing which the different small\r\nparties came and joined the old men. The singing lasted about ten\r\nminutes, when praying succeeded, and each individual pronounced a\r\ndifferent prayer aloud. At this time a minister placed himself on the\r\nplatform or pulpit, and in a stentorian voice, ejaculated an impassioned\r\nprayer, which, by degrees, excited the feelings of the people below him,\r\nand when they reached what he, perhaps, considered the proper key, he\r\ndescended and joined them on his knees.\r\n\r\nI was standing close beside the worshippers, on a trough used for\r\ncollecting the juice of the maple in spring, leaning my back against a\r\ntree, and gazing on the extraordinary scene. Many individuals of both\r\nsexes were bellowing at the utmost pitch of their voice, and clapping\r\ntheir hands in seeming transport; others were whining supplicatory\r\nstrains, and wringing their hands in despair. The comely young woman and\r\nher companion, formerly noticed, joined the group in a standing position\r\nin the first instance; they soon became bathed in tears, and ultimately\r\njoined in prayer in a state of high excitement. A very emaciated old\r\nwoman, with dishevelled locks of silvery whiteness, shrieked so loud and\r\npiteously, that the minister’s voice became unheard, and something like\r\na thrill of uneasiness vibrated on my nerves. Such was the confusion and\r\ndiscord, that I was unable to collect two connecting sentences from the\r\nprayer of any individual. When the devotees had seemingly reached the\r\nhighest pitch to which their feelings would strain, the lady with the\r\ngipsy bonnet stepped forward near to where I was standing, and commenced\r\nsinging in the most soothing and melodious tone. She was joined by her\r\nsister and brother, and soon afterwards by all the sect. In this manner\r\nprayer and praise succeeded each other, during which the feelings of the\r\nworshippers were alternately excited and lulled by minister and nymph,\r\nlike ocean by tempest and calm.\r\n\r\nMany bystanders were laughing at the exclamations and postures of the\r\nworshippers; others were reading newspapers, or carelessly engaged in\r\nconversation. One individual, more prominent in his ridicule than the\r\nrest, was rebuked for his conduct by one of the sect, when a controversy\r\nensued between the parties, who were listened to by a crowd collected\r\naround them. On approaching the disputants, one was openly avowing his\r\nunbelief in the Bible, and the other, without meekness, condemning his\r\nsentiments and conduct; but neither possessing the power of arranging an\r\nargument, I left them engaged in the hopeless task of trying to convince\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThere was something so different in the impassioned supplications of the\r\nminister, whose aim seemed to be to rouse the feelings, without\r\nimpressing the minds, of his audience—in the time, place, and manner of\r\naddressing the Supreme Being, so different to what I had been accustomed\r\nto in the Presbyterian worship of Scotland, that at first I could not\r\nbelieve the sect was addressing the same Deity. The earnest, excited, I\r\nmay say hysterical, devotions of one party, the indifference and\r\nunrestrained scoffing of the other, gave rise to such conflicting\r\nemotions, that I arranged to meet my friend in half an hour, and retired\r\nfrom the multitude.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, fires had been lighted up on the ground in different\r\nparts of the square, one six feet high near the platform, and a few\r\ncandles were glimmering in the tents. The foliage of the maple and oak,\r\nso remarkable for richness and variety of autumnal tints, formed a\r\nbeautiful canopy over the heads of the people, and, when gilded by the\r\nflames of blazing fagots, and intermingled by rising sparks, had a\r\nsupernatural and solemn effect. Could I have alone contemplated nature\r\nunconnected with the part humanity was acting, my enjoyment might have\r\nbeen great, but the wailings of fellow-beings, and the shouts of boys on\r\nreaching the ground, disturbed returning repose.\r\n\r\nOn again approaching my friend, a preacher was thanking the Almighty for\r\nthe manifestations of his goodness since they had met together, and\r\nconcluded by requesting all who desired to be released from their sins,\r\nto accompany him to another place, and a procession to the place ensued.\r\nThis consisted of a small enclosure, formed by a single rail of\r\nsaplings, nailed to the standing trees, in the centre of which were two\r\nbranchless trunks lying parallel to each other, and is perhaps what is\r\ntermed the pen. Here the preacher again requested all who earnestly\r\ndesired to be relieved from their sins, to come within the lines which\r\nhad been prepared for them.\r\n\r\nThe whole devotees then prayed promiscuously aloud, and when at the\r\nheight of excitement, the nymph of the gipsy bonnet commenced singing,\r\nstanding on the outside of the enclosure, and was joined by the people\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nWhen the singing ceased, it was announced that Brother Fraiser was to\r\npreach, and the people assembled around the shade on the seats prepared\r\nfor them, after being repeatedly requested to do so. At the conclusion\r\nof praise and prayer, a text was given out, and sermon commenced. Mr\r\nFraiser now discovered that he was hoarse, perhaps from previous\r\nexertion, and in the midst of his apology to the audience, I took my\r\nleave at half-past eight o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe devotees were few in number, perhaps not more than sixty, and almost\r\neither old men or young women, the Irish brogue being conspicuous\r\namongst the former. They seemed of the lowest class, not more than\r\nhalf-a-dozen of well-dressed people being amongst them. There were four\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nI could not divine why the pretty creature with the gipsy bonnet did not\r\njoin in prayer, and commenced singing at the proper time. Could her\r\nbonnet and clothes be too fine for kneeling and tossing on the ground\r\nlike others, or had she a part to act?\r\n\r\nAt the time of my departure, there might be nearly three hundred people\r\non the ground, including all descriptions, amongst whom were fifteen or\r\ntwenty females, unconnected with the sect, and a great many boys. On\r\nwalking from the meeting, many youths were met on their way to it.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice for me to say, that I did not witness any act of\r\nimpropriety or indecency by the attenders of the camp-meeting; but\r\nwhether this arose from the character of the people, the time of night,\r\nor my want of discernment, others may determine. The meeting was,\r\nhowever, a small one, and in a part of the country not likely to have\r\nfurnished many examples of disregardless profligacy. Whether\r\ncamp-meetings are favourable to the cause of genuine religion, is matter\r\nof dispute, and the greater part of those whom I heard speak on the\r\nsubject, supported the negative side of the question. Perhaps the matter\r\nis oftener determined by feeling than reason. It would be presumption to\r\ngive a decided opinion on so serious a subject, with such limited\r\nopportunity of judging; but something extraordinary will occur to induce\r\nme again to visit a camp-meeting. This may be prejudice.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the camp-meeting, we proceeded to a tavern five miles\r\ndistant, on reaching which we learned that the beds and floors were so\r\noccupied, that we could not gain admittance. We, however, obtained\r\npermission to lodge ourselves in the barn, which, on scrambling over\r\nseveral rail fences, we found open, and occupied by human beings snoring\r\nin full chorus. The mows of grain being of different heights, we\r\nascended to the attics, where we passed the night. The grain seemed to\r\nhave been lately carried in, its upper surface being moist from\r\nsweating, which, joined to currents of air passing through the openings\r\nin the roof, rendered me so cold, that I had recourse to my flannel\r\nshirt for the first and last time between leaving Montreal and New York.\r\nNext morning I awoke from a sound sleep, and, like a dog, put myself to\r\nrights by a shake, shouldered my knapsack, and took the road at\r\nhalf-past four o’clock, in as good walking trim as at any former period\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\nThe day proved hot—we dined at Delaware, a village of seven or eight\r\nhouses, situated on the Thames, over which there is a bridge, and the\r\nroad passes to the north side of the river. I was anxious to be present\r\nat a sale of Crown lands, which was to take place at Chatham next day,\r\nbut we could not obtain the means of transport, and no alternative\r\nremained but jogging along on foot. We called at the land-office at\r\nCaradoc, and reached Mrs Aldgeo’s tavern an hour after nightfall, where\r\nwe found two gentlemen who had passed us on the road in the afternoon,\r\nand one of whom I had seen at York. They were going to the sale of Crown\r\nlands at Chatham, which one of them did not reach in time, and the other\r\nremained at Mrs Aldgeo’s, having been slightly injured by a fall from a\r\nwaggon.\r\n\r\nMrs Aldgeo’s tavern is a log-house of mean appearance, having two\r\napartments—a kitchen, and room for all purposes. It is, however, the\r\nmost comfortable house of entertainment in this part of the country,\r\nowing to the excellent management and good-humour of the hostess. Four\r\nindividuals slept in the same appartment, in two clean beds, in which we\r\nwere told, by way of recommendation, the Chief-Justice and\r\nAttorney-General had slept a few nights before.\r\n\r\nThe next morning proved wet, which enabled me to see a little of the\r\neconomy of the establishment; and I particularly remarked a poor fowl\r\nvery unceremoniously knocked off a rail fence with a stick, and in the\r\nspace of twenty minutes presented at table in the shape of an excellent\r\nstew. Mrs Aldgeo is a genuine Irish lady, from the old country, and her\r\nkindness and loquacity during breakfast, which she served out, were\r\nunbounded. She did not always wait for an answer to her questions; and\r\nwith a few pauses, held forth in the following manner:—\r\n\r\n“I was married at the age of twenty-four to Aldgeo, then eighteen and\r\na-half, and the finest-looking man in the world. I lost him six years\r\nago, God rest his soul! it was a sad loss to me as—but of this no more.\r\nYes, my poor dead husband left four horses, fifteen sheep, twenty cows,\r\nforty hogs, ox chains, auger, gimlet, and other farm utensils. Will you\r\ntake something more, Mr ——? I will help you to a little more of the\r\nfowl; you must eat while under my charge, and not become thin—there,\r\ntake an egg. Here is an elegant potato from the garden, where they are\r\nplanted for the old woman, as she has not time to go to the fields. My\r\nboy will sometimes say, ah, mother, leave the gentlemen to themselves;\r\nbut I like to press old-country gentlemen, when not proud. I never press\r\nYankees; them boys help themselves. Yankee women are lazy\r\ngood-for-nothings, eating cake and sucking sugar all day long. I attend\r\nto man and beast. Yes, there is no one to assist me in the house, and I\r\nlook to the fowls, hogs, and cows; in the evenings, my feet are like to\r\ndrop out of my shoes. Do you see that field on the opposite side of the\r\nroad?—my hands burnt all the brush on that field. Do take some of the\r\nbread baked by the old woman; I bake some every afternoon—that is\r\nhandsome bread. The Scotch lawyer below, with the wooden leg, and angel\r\nchildren, brought his pretty little wife here to learn to make bread. I\r\nuse no barm, but mix two parts of milk and one of water together, add a\r\nspoonful of salt, a little flour, and let them stand ten or twelve hours\r\nby the fire. Then make the bread with milk, as water gives it a black\r\ncolour. I make my own soap—oh, darling soap—and never boil it. My boys\r\nhave not taken wives, but my two eldest daughters are married. Did you\r\nobserve an elegant store at the corner of —— in London? that belongs to\r\nmy daughter’s husband. My youngest girl is at a boarding-school in\r\nLondon, where two ladies from England have lately commenced, and I pay\r\nfor my girl $39 a-year.”\r\n\r\nThe rain ceasing about noon, we left Mrs Aldgeo’s, and reached\r\nHowardbridge to tea, where the road passes to the south side of the\r\nThames. The roads were fatiguing in consequence of their wetness, and we\r\ngladly accepted of an offer, made by two gentleman in a waggon, to carry\r\nour knapsacks, and in whose company we next day travelled to Chatham,\r\nwhere we spent the night. Some time before reaching Chatham, I obtained\r\na draught of water from a young girl on the banks of the Thames, to whom\r\nI proffered a piece of money, which she declined, saying, she never\r\naccepted money for such things. At this time my British habits were not\r\naltogether laid aside.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the banks of the Thames, from the point where the St Thomas\r\nroad joins that from London to Sandwich, is oak openings, seemingly of\r\ninferior quality, all the way to Delaware, and from thence, to six miles\r\nbelow Mrs Aldgeo’s tavern, poor clay, with small stunted wood. From\r\nthis, passing through the site of the old Moravian Indian village, the\r\nsoil is poor sand, and a little farther on, becomes loam of the best\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Indian village is situated on a bend of the Thames, and the\r\nsurrounding lands were bearing luxuriant crops of Indian corn. The old\r\nvillage was burnt by the Americans during the last war, and on its site,\r\na mile to the Math of the present one, some fine apple-trees are\r\nstanding, the fruit of which we found agreeable as quenching thirst.\r\nHere I observed, for the first time, a species of hawthorn with glossy\r\nleaves, of a smaller size, more numerous prickles, branching, and of\r\ntaller growth than the common hawthorn of the country, and apparently a\r\nbetter hedge-plant. On the banks of the Thames, above Chatham,\r\n(_Celestina Scandens_,) a climbing plant, with beautiful orange-coloured\r\nberries, was first observed growing luxuriantly on many trees, entwined\r\nwith the vine. Apple-trees are numerous near the river, and the crop so\r\nabundant, that they were breaking under their load. I was offered any\r\nquantity of fruit at 1½d. sterling per bushel, gathering it myself. The\r\npeaches were also a great crop. A pear-tree was seldom seen.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, we walked down the banks of the Thames, for the purpose\r\nof procuring horses for an excursion, and succeeded in our mission. In\r\nreturning, we observed two men of colour crossing the river in a canoe,\r\nand leading a horse, which was swimming. On entering into conversation\r\nwith them, I learned they were brothers from Kentucky, and both farmed\r\non lease, one of them renting 190 acres on the banks of the river, fifty\r\nof which were cleared, for $20 per annum. On asking if they had run away\r\nfrom Kentucky, one of them answered in the affirmative, and replied,\r\nlaughingly, I suppose you have also run away. A great many people of\r\ncolour are settled in the Western parts of Upper Canada, almost all of\r\nwhom are runaway slaves from the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th September we left Chatham for Bear creek,\r\nunder the guidance of Mr John Goose, who owned a property on the banks\r\nof the Thames, four miles below Chatham, inherited from his father, who\r\nwas one of the original settlers. Mr Goose was a sensible, well-informed\r\nman, of a weakly constitution, and had let his farm on shares to a\r\nYankee, by which he obtained half the produce for his labour. Mr Goose\r\nrode a brown mare, with a filly foal running at her feet, in the\r\nlanguage of the country styled a colt, a term applied to the young of\r\nthe mares, without regard to sex. My friend C—— and I rode chestnuts, or\r\nsorrels, without shoes, the reins were stout ropes, and the saddles\r\nwithout panels or girths. On, however, we jogged up the Thames, and\r\ncrossed over to Bear creek, which we reached about four o’clock, and got\r\nsome refreshment at the house of Mr Goose’s brother-in-law, whom we\r\nfound sowing wheat. The ostensible object of our journey was to examine\r\nsome lots of land which had been offered us by letter in the township of\r\nDawne, and regarding the situation of which we could not obtain\r\ninformation till arriving on the creek, when we learned it was in the\r\nopposite direction where we were, and so swampy that no person could\r\nlive on it. We then commenced descending the stream, and passed the\r\nnight with Mr B——, friend to Mr Goose, sleeping soundly on the floor.\r\nNext morning, we descended the creek four or five miles below, where its\r\nwaters are on a level with those of Lake St Clair, and crossed over to\r\nthe Thames, which we passed below Chatham in a canoe, swimming the\r\nhorses by its side. Here we parted with Mr Goose, much pleased with his\r\nconduct, paying him $4, or 16s. 8d. sterling, for the services of three\r\nhorses and himself two days.\r\n\r\nThe soil, on the banks of the Thames, varies from soft sand to strong\r\nclay, and may generally be termed heavy loam. Our first and most\r\neasterly line from the Thames to Bear creek was poor sand, gradually\r\nimproving to fine loam on approaching the creek. The banks of the creek\r\nshowed the richest description of sandy loam; and much of what is termed\r\nbottom land, more especially above Mr B——’s property, is perhaps too\r\nrich for first crops. This richest of land, extending to both sides of\r\nthe creek, and containing a thousand acres, was unoccupied, for sale,\r\nand could have been bought at about $3 per acre. Our lower line, from\r\nBear creek to the Thames, was invariably fine loam.\r\n\r\nI consider the soil on the banks of the Thames, around Chatham, superior\r\nto what I saw on Bear creek, from containing a greater portion of clay;\r\nboth are, however, excellent, and objectionable only on account of their\r\nlowness, and proximity to the marshy plains around Lake St Clair, though\r\nonly ten or twelve feet above its waters, yet twenty miles distant from\r\nits shore. The forest exhibited few cradle knolls, which proves the soil\r\nof stronger texture than that of Blenheim, Wilmot, or the neighbourhood\r\nof Goderich, cradle knolls being a sure indication of sand, except where\r\ntrees are prostrated by a whirlwind or hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the Thames and Bear creek do not merit much notice.\r\nBear creek, and the country between it and the Thames, is very thinly\r\nsettled, and the clearances of small extent. The habitations are mean,\r\nand the inhabitants seemingly poor, and without enterprise or industry.\r\nThe chief market has hitherto been Detroit, and the population have, in\r\na great measure, been shut out from the rest of the world. Mr B—— told\r\nme thirty bushels of wheat have been given for a bushel of salt—now five\r\nis the price. I did not see a clearance of any extent going on, while\r\nsome portion of rich cleared soil had been abandoned or neglected; and\r\nwhen overgrown with weeds, and destitute of grass, exhibited complete\r\nsterility. Natural clover of any kind was not visible, nor had the seeds\r\nof any been sown. The settlers had never applied any manure, and seemed\r\nto lead easy lives. The wheat harvest was gathered previous to my visit.\r\nBuck wheat was uniformly a poor crop, being injured by drought, and in\r\nmany cases also by frost. Indian corn was by no means good. A field of\r\nbarley on Bear creek, as the first crop on bottom land, was destroyed by\r\nmildew. A portion of millet on the same field was uninjured, and the\r\nonly instance in which I have seen such a crop.\r\n\r\nBear creek is a small stream, about half the size of the Thames, and\r\npropels two grist mills, and a third at Mr B——’s is being erected. We\r\nexamined the lowest mill; the water-power was not economically applied;\r\nthe house without a door; the machinery entirely of wood; and the whole\r\nerection a bauble of the worst construction. There were perhaps fifty\r\nsmall parcels of wheat for grinding in the mill, and six or seven people\r\nwere waiting to carry away their flour. This mill cannot make marketable\r\nflour at present, and its undurable construction may be considered\r\nfortunate for settlers. Grist mills are much wanted in the country, none\r\nbeing effective on the Thames, and I was told wheat has actually come\r\nfrom Michigan to be ground at this wretched mill.\r\n\r\nThe river Thames, the letters of which are invariably pronounced soft by\r\nthe inhabitants of the country, is of small size, incapable of moving\r\nmachinery for want of fall, and when seen by me, perhaps not more than\r\nequal to the power of a grist mill with one good pair of stones, if fall\r\ncould be obtained. The banks are low and uninteresting. The water is on\r\na level with Lake St Clair, and is navigable five miles above Chatham.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the houses of many of the settlers on Bear creek and the\r\nThames, and observed the countenances of hundreds of people seen on\r\nroads and in fields, I was particularly struck with the sallow, dried,\r\nand sickly appearance of the inhabitants. Perhaps, in the course of\r\nthree days’ travelling, I did not meet half-a-dozen of healthy-looking\r\nindividuals;—a recently-imported old-countryman could always be\r\ndistinguished by his complexion, and often, also, by his portliness of\r\nfigure. While speaking on this subject, Mr Goose did not like the\r\nchuncky (stout) appearance of Britons, and could not comprehend why the\r\nskin of their faces seemed to creep like Muscovado sugar. Ague was\r\nevidently not a stranger to the country; and a lodger in the tavern at\r\nChatham was suffering under the complaint.\r\n\r\nChatham is on the south bank of the Thames. Twelve months ago it was\r\nsaid to contain only five or six houses; now there are nearly twenty. It\r\nis visited by steam-boats; and from being situated at what may be termed\r\nthe head of the Thames navigation, it is certain of rising at no distant\r\nday. There is a rumour of making Chatham, instead of Sandwich, the seat\r\nof the district courts, which would be a more convenient situation; but\r\nthe growth of Chatham seems to be independent of this alteration.\r\n\r\nAfter parting with Mr Goose, and dining at Chatham hotel, kept by Mr\r\nCartier, a French Canadian, and who was enlarging his house from an\r\nincrease of business, we engaged Israel Williams, a man of colour, who\r\nowned an excellent farm in the vicinity of Chatham, to carry us with a\r\nwaggon and pair of horses south to Lake Erie, and round the lake and\r\nDetroit river to Sandwich.\r\n\r\nTwo roads led to Lake Erie, one by what was called the town line, and\r\nanother across the plains. Having heard much of the plains from Mr\r\nGoose, who said all the farmers in the neighbourhood cut hay from them,\r\nand that a squatter had been successful in growing crops, although\r\nconsidered barren, I was anxious to see the plains; and accordingly took\r\nthem on our way to the lake, although Israel Williams had never\r\ntravelled the road.\r\n\r\nWe left Chatham about half-past nine, and soon reached the plains, two\r\nmiles north of Chatham. At the east end, where we passed through, they\r\nconsist of an area between two and three miles wide, and as far as the\r\neye could reach to the westward, destitute of trees, except small spots\r\nhere and there, bearing shrubs and stunted trees of various sizes, and\r\nwhich resembled islands in a lake. A number of dwarfish willows were\r\ngrowing in most places, and the grass consisted chiefly of two species,\r\nwhich occasionally reached the horses’ ears. A number of beautiful\r\nflowering plants adorned the plains, but being thoroughly wet, and rain\r\nfalling heavily at the time, my botanizing zeal abated, and I contented\r\nmyself with adding the seeds of four or five to my collection, gathered\r\nwithout descending from the waggon. Williams missed the tract leading\r\ninto the forest on the south side of the plains, which we perambulated\r\nfor upwards of an hour, till reaching a house, containing a ragged,\r\ndirty, and miserable looking family, a boy of which acted as our guide\r\ntill entering the forest. We reached what the people of the country call\r\nFrogmore-street, a newly opened road leading from Sandwich; from which\r\nwe were directed to Lake Erie, but missing our way a second time, it was\r\nabout sunset before we came in sight of the lake, having been nine hours\r\nin travelling a distance of twelve miles.\r\n\r\nWhen emerging from the woods on Lake Erie, we passed a camp-meeting of\r\nthe Jacksonite Methodists, which I felt no inclination to visit. On\r\nenquiring to be directed to the nearest tavern, I was told there was not\r\na tavern on the road for thirty miles, but that almost any farmer would\r\nreceive us for the night.\r\n\r\nOur first three or four applications for accommodation were\r\nunsuccessful, the houses being filled with the attendants of the\r\ncamp-meeting; but we at last gained admittance to the house of John\r\nMacdonald, from Appin, Argyleshire, Scotland. Application had in this\r\nsolitary instance been made by Williams, and John reluctantly consented\r\nto receive us, under the impression we were people of colour like\r\nWilliams. John was surprised to find us of the same complexion as\r\nhimself, and still more so when I said he must be a countryman of mine,\r\nfrom his dialect as a Scotchman. He put a thousand questions about my\r\nvisit to the country and the state of Scotland, and when satisfied that\r\nI was not an impostor, his joy seemed unbounded. John was a true Scotch\r\nHighlander in every respect, and spoke the English language in the comic\r\npurity, if I may use the expression, of his countrymen,—his phrases of\r\n“her nainsell,” and “gosh, man,” being as fresh as if from Appin the day\r\nbefore. I enjoyed his originality, and admired his warmth of heart,\r\namply displayed in anecdotes of his past life, which he continued to\r\nrelate long after we went to bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning I walked over John’s farm, consisting of 200 acres of most\r\nexcellent land, forty of which had been cleared in fourteen years,\r\nduring which he had not applied any manure, and which I testify had not\r\naccumulated to an inconvenient degree. His Indian corn was about the\r\nbest crop I saw in Canada, with exception of some belonging to the\r\nIndians on the Grand River. The quality of his wheat was excellent, and\r\npart of his farm carried this crop and peas alternately; the extent of\r\nwheat being limited to the assistance he could obtain during harvest.\r\nJohn had two sons on adjoining farms, in the same state as their\r\nfather’s, and a third who had lately married, lived with him. John had\r\ntwelve acres of good land, which had been gradually cleared in obtaining\r\ntimber for different purposes, and which a week’s work of his son would\r\nrender fit for cultivation; yet it had remained for years in a state of\r\ncomparative unproductiveness. He wondered at me not having tasted unripe\r\nIndian corn, on which every creature, he said, lived in this country, as\r\nthey did on herrings in the west of Scotland during the season; and he\r\nroasted two ears for me, which I did not highly relish. John’s house was\r\nvery mean-looking, and he accounted for it by the want of saw-mills in\r\nthis part of the country, which rendered boards dear.\r\n\r\nWe left John Macdonald after breakfast, and travelled to Colborne\r\nIron-works, in the township of Gossfield, and had a late and\r\nuncomfortable dinner where the workmen board. A bed was obtained for us\r\nat the house of Messrs Calhoum and Field, proprietors of the\r\nworks,—which was a log-house of recent erection, plain and rough,\r\nexternally and internally.\r\n\r\nThe furnace had been burnt down a few weeks before our arrival, and all\r\nhands were engaged in reconstructing it. The whole erection, with\r\nexception of the fireplace and chimneystalk, was composed of wood, and\r\none of the most temporary buildings it is possible to conceive. The bed\r\nof ore lies in a marsh a mile and a half distant, and is what is called\r\nbog-ore, one or two feet thick, with six inches of peat-earth on the\r\nsurface; and I was assured by Mr Field that the earth thrown aside two\r\nyears ago was now fruitful of ore. The iron-work is expected to consume\r\nthe coke of nearly 200 acres of forest yearly; and the company would\r\nclear any farmer’s woodland for the coke it produced. This may be worth\r\nthe notice of settlers, and is given from Mr Field’s statement.\r\n\r\nWe examined some land for sale in the neighbourhood of the iron-works\r\nbefore breakfast; after partaking of which, we travelled a few miles\r\nsouth, to the shores of Lake Erie, round which we passed to\r\nAmherstburgh, which we reached in the evening.\r\n\r\nWilliams had at one time resided at Amherstburgh, and landed us at what\r\nhe considered the best house, kept by Mrs Drake, which was a large old\r\ndingy uninhabited looking tenement. Mrs Drake was seated with Mr M—— at\r\ntea, or supper, as it is generally called, on our arrival, which suited\r\nus well, as we had not dined,—a brace of roasted ducks being on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAfter tea, we walked down the banks of the Detroit river and Lake Erie\r\nfour or five miles, and returned through the fields, at some distance\r\nfrom our former line. The evening was clear, calm, and delightfully\r\ncool; the still glassy lake adorned with beautiful wooded islands, the\r\nAmerican steam-boats, with music playing and unfurled sails,\r\nmajestically ascending the limped and smooth-gliding Detroit, together\r\nwith the gracefulness of vegetation and richness of soil, so enchanted\r\nus, that we resolved, contrary to our original intention, to devote\r\nanother day to the neighbourhood of Amherstburgh.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Williams drove us up the banks of the Detroit, till we\r\nreached the bridge crossing the Canrad, where we parted with him.\r\nAscending the Canrad a little way, we turned to the right, up a flat\r\npiece of ground, in the centre of which there is a small brook, and\r\nwhere we spent some hours agreeably in examining plants, and adding to\r\nour collection of seeds. We returned through the lands belonging to the\r\nHuron Indians to Amherstburgh, and in the evening extended our walk in\r\nthe direction we had passed the night before.\r\n\r\nWe left Amherstburgh soon after sunrise, to walk by Sandwich to the town\r\nof Detroit, and breakfasted by the way at a small inn with a French\r\nsign. The innkeeper had very little English, and we found some\r\ndifficulty in understanding each other. Our fare consisted of poor green\r\ntea, bad butter, and worse bread. There was a fireplace in the kitchen,\r\nwhich was without furniture, except a table and chairs. The room was\r\nwell lighted, and separated from the kitchen by a partition of lath,\r\nwithout plaster of any kind. There were two beds in the room without top\r\nor posts, with fine rich old printed bedcovers and pillowslips of the\r\nsame, clean and neatly arranged. The upper story was accessible by a\r\nladder. The father told me his family consisted of six children; the\r\nmother and two children had died a few weeks before. The children are at\r\nschool; the masters seldom remain long, being too fond of whisky.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the ferry opposite to Detroit about noon, which we crossed\r\nby a steam-boat of small size which plies every quarter of an hour, and\r\ntook up our abode at an excellent hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  _Horse Hiring—French Inn—Negro Family—Prairie—Supplied with Oats—Mouth\r\n    of the Thames—Elephant—Yorkshiremen—Want of Conveyance—Old\r\n    Settler—Prairie—Face of the Country and Soil—Notices of French\r\n    Inhabitants and their Agriculture—Huron Indians and their\r\n    Agriculture—Royalists and their Agriculture—Notices of\r\n    Nature—Detroit River—Amherstburgh—Sandwich—Ferry—Detroit._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friend C—— sailed from Detroit for Buffalo on the 12th September, and\r\nnext day I commenced a tour into the Western United States, from which I\r\nreturned again to Detroit, and spent a few days in Canada.\r\n\r\nWith a view of keeping a connected account of Canada, I shall take up my\r\nproceedings on the 18th October, on the morning of which I crossed from\r\nDetroit to the British side of the river, on which there is situated a\r\ngood many houses of different descriptions, with the view of obtaining a\r\nhorse to proceed to Chatham on the Thames, a distance of fifty miles.\r\nBeing refused by three different people who kept horses for hire, on\r\nwhat appeared to me frivolous pretences, and thinking they might be\r\nafraid of me leaving the horse, and escaping to the States, I offered to\r\ndeposit the value of the horse with the owner before setting out on the\r\njourney. To this arrangement one individual out of the three consented,\r\nbut demanded for the use of his horse the same hire as if he himself and\r\na pair of horses had accompanied me, as he could not employ himself and\r\nthe other in my absence. Under these circumstances I returned to\r\nDetroit, where I readily obtained a horse, which I entered at the\r\ncustomhouse before setting out on my journey, and again on my return, or\r\nrather paid the fees at once. I am not sure if it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to enter a horse at the customhouse on crossing the Detroit\r\nriver; and at the time suspected it was as much with the view of\r\nobtaining the fees, as complying with law, the owner of the horse\r\nrequested me to apply at the customhouse with which he was connected.\r\n\r\nThe road from the town of Detroit, or rather Sandwich, which is on the\r\nCanadian side of the river Detroit, to Chatham, passes along the margin\r\nof Lake St Clair and the river Thames, and is the chief line of\r\ncommunication with the most westerly and other parts of Canada; yet\r\nexcept in the neighbourhood of Detroit and Chatham, I could not obtain\r\noats or Indian corn to feed my horse. My first application was at the\r\ndoor of a newly erected house on Lake St Clair, in which I observed two\r\nyoung men through the window, and a voice answered to come round to the\r\nother door, on tapping at which I was told to come in, and on lifting\r\nthe latch I found three men and two women, none of whom rose from their\r\nseats, or could tell me where my horse could be fed. At length I came to\r\na house near the mouth of the Thames, with a French signpost at the\r\ndoor, where I stopt for an hour, my horse getting only coarse marsh hay.\r\n\r\nThis inn is situated on a ridge of sand thrown up by the lake, and about\r\ntwo feet above its waters; the surrounding country, for miles on all\r\nsides, being a marsh and destitute of inhabitants, another unoccupied\r\nhouse being a few hundred yards distant. Here a Canadian Frenchwoman of\r\nprepossessing appearance resided, and who spoke the English language\r\ntolerably well. Her husband died the previous year of cholera, and a\r\nyoung man who assisted her since, died a week or two before my arrival,\r\nof small-pox, and two girls were then just recovering from the same\r\ncomplaint. She told me a traveller had scarcely entered her door for\r\nseven weeks, and there was no one to fetch her oats and other\r\nnecessaries. My poor horse, which was the roughest-motioned creature I\r\never bestrode, became tired, and I was anxious to shorten his journey as\r\nmuch as possible.\r\n\r\nI called on Mr John Goose, with whom I travelled to Bear creek a month\r\nbefore, and who resided on the Thames, four miles below Chatham. He was\r\nin the woods bringing home firewood, and was momentarily expected, so I\r\ngave my horse some of his hay, and walked out to meet him. Mr Goose\r\nreadily recognised me; and on learning my intention of wishing to pass\r\nthe night at his house, on account of the tired state of my horse, was\r\ninformed, he himself would be happy to receive me, but his wife was not\r\nfond of seeing strangers at present when small-pox were rife in the\r\ncountry, his family never having had the disease, or been vaccinated.\r\nKnowing the situation in which I had been a few hours before, I did not\r\nurge the matter with Mr Goose, although not a thorough disciple of the\r\nschool of infection, and taking my wearied horse in my hand, proceeded\r\nonwards.\r\n\r\nI called on Israel Williams, in whose stable I left my horse, and walked\r\non to Mr Cartier’s inn, Chatham, where I passed the night. On enquiring\r\nfor Israel’s horses, Pape and Jerry, which carried me round Lake Erie\r\nlast month, he told me, that, when swimming Pape across the Thames about\r\nten days ago in a canoe, he sunk like a stone, and remained under water\r\ntwo hours, having been, he supposed, seized with cramp. Williams was a\r\nrunaway negro from the State of Virginia, a smart, active, stout little\r\nfellow, in good circumstances, having several stacks of wheat, and six\r\nor seven horses of different ages. I was asked to go into his house and\r\nsee his wife Juliana, who was as stout and glossy black as any negro\r\ncould desire. They had five or six fine curly-haired children of the\r\nsame complexion as themselves, none of whom had been at school, as the\r\nteacher could not receive children of colour without displeasing his\r\nwhite employers.\r\n\r\nNext morning, immediately after breakfast, I rode to the plains which I\r\nformerly crossed in a waggon, and, under the guidance of the squatter Mr\r\nCass, had an opportunity of giving them a hurried examination. The\r\nplains of Chatham are, beyond all doubt, prairie, extending from Lake St\r\nClair on both sides of the Thames. The east end of the prairie, next to\r\nChatham, is variable soil, embracing sand of different colours, and clay\r\nof all textures, generally wet, and seemingly capable of being drained\r\ninto the river. The wood islands are small, the grass in some parts very\r\nluxuriant, and several of the plants similar to those on the Michigan\r\nprairies. On advancing westward, the soil improves, and some parts are\r\nclay of the first quality. The grass on much of this prairie is four\r\nfeet high, and as thick as it can stand; no part of Illinois seems\r\nricher.\r\n\r\nNo part of this prairie is cultivated; it is so little above the level\r\nof Lake St Clair, that it is doubtful if it can be drained, and much of\r\nit at present indicates wetness. I was anxious to ascertain the\r\npracticability of draining the prairie; but well-informed people at\r\nSandwich and Detroit told me, instruments for levelling could not be\r\nobtained nearer than New York, and all streams being dry, there were no\r\nmeans of approximating the point. Some of the farmers on the Thames\r\nmaintained there was no difficulty in the matter, and all mentioned Lake\r\nErie, and not St Clair, as the outlet. I had no opportunity of forming\r\nan opinion on the subject, but if the drainage can only be effected by\r\nLake Erie, the undertaking will be far too expensive for a private\r\nindividual; and, in the present circumstances of Canada, not likely to\r\nrepay a company for the outlay.\r\n\r\nLake St Clair, and the other lakes connected with the river St Lawrence,\r\ndo not rise and fall by floods and droughts like ordinary collections of\r\nwater in other parts of the world, yet it is subject to variations at\r\ndistant periods; and this, I believe, has not been satisfactorily\r\naccounted for. The Frenchwoman who keeps the inn at the mouth of the\r\nThames told me the lake was lower now than she had ever known it, and\r\nhad been falling for years past. She said it continued to rise for years\r\nformerly, and drove people from the houses she pointed out, at some\r\ndistance on the prairie, and thought it now eighteen inches below its\r\nhighest level. This change of elevation on the lake might affect the\r\nprairie, even when drained.\r\n\r\nThe grass on the margin of the prairie near the Thames, and more\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of French church, six or seven miles\r\nfrom the junction of the river with Lake St Clair, is of the richest\r\ndescription, having a large portion of white clover, and cropped as\r\nshort as teeth could make it. Yet the animals of all descriptions\r\nroaming on it were small, lean, stunted-looking creatures. This, in some\r\nmeasure, may have been owing to their respective breeds, but I could not\r\nresist auguring unfavourably of the land from the poverty of the animals\r\ngrazing on it.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the prairie I found my horse getting tired; and on applying\r\nto a farmer on the banks of the Thames, he readily consented to furnish\r\noats, for which he would not accept of payment. I also was asked into\r\nhis house, and partook of his hospitality. I could not with propriety\r\nenquire the gentleman’s name, but learned his farm was Lot tenth, of\r\nConcession first. I need not, through this medium, ask him to accept of\r\nmy thanks, however grateful I may feel, as there is little chance of his\r\nseeing or hearing of my lucubrations.\r\n\r\nI reached the inn at the mouth of the Thames, where I remained for the\r\nnight, getting a clean and good bed, fried pork morning and evening, and\r\nacting as my own ostler. In the morning I walked over a considerable\r\nextent of the shores of Lake St Clair, and the mouth of the Thames. The\r\nsoil is exceedingly poor, and so wet that animals cannot walk over much\r\nof it. Here I saw the Thames steam-boat coming down the river from\r\nChatham, which had a singular appearance when viewed from the prairie,\r\nthe river being about two feet below the surface, the ground so\r\nperfectly level, and without an object of any kind, that the vessel\r\nseemed gliding on land.\r\n\r\nI left the inn after breakfast, and reached Detroit in the afternoon,\r\nwith my horse nearly done up. By the way I met an elephant walking on\r\nthe road towards Chatham, covered with canvass, and attended by two men\r\non horseback. A waggon led the cavalcade, in which I was told there was\r\na lion and some other animals. The exhibiting of animals must yet be an\r\nindifferent trade in Canada, when population is so thin and poor.\r\n\r\nI met many old-country Yorkshiremen at Detroit. The ostler who received\r\nmy horse was from that county; a flash fellow, strutting the streets\r\nwith a scarlet frock coat, collar and pocketlids of black velvet, with\r\ntop boots and buckskins, was a Yorkshire tailor; and a Yorkshireman was\r\nentertaining many listeners in the bar-room of the hotel while dinner\r\nwas preparing for me, having arrived after the regular hour. This\r\ncharacter was dressed in his smock-coat, with tight lacing boots and\r\nleggans, as if from his native country a minute before, and was telling\r\ncock-and-bull stories about his shooting feats with Lord Liverpool and\r\nother great men, as their companion. His language, dress, and appearance\r\nformed a striking contrast to the grave, thoughtful-looking Americans,\r\nwho did not make a remark or alter an expression of countenance\r\nindicating their opinion of Yorky; yet they seemed to be eyeing him with\r\na keenness, as if measuring the strength and depth of his character.\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of dinner, I recrossed the river to the Canadian side,\r\nwalked over some French settlements, and passed the night at Sandwich.\r\nThe hotel was a poor, dirty, ill-finished place, and more especially the\r\nsleeping part of it. Here I met with two gentlemen of the village, whose\r\nconversation was of considerable use to me.\r\n\r\nNext morning it was my intention to have visited a new settlement, four\r\nmiles to the east of Sandwich, but I was unable to obtain a horse or\r\nconveyance of any kind in this metropolis of Western Canada. The people\r\nof the hotels do not in the least degree interest themselves in the\r\nproceedings of travellers, and knew of no one likely to hire his horses\r\nor waggon. I, however, applied to several French inhabitants without\r\neffect; and the day being wet I had no alternative but to walk down the\r\nbanks of the river to Amherstburgh, where, with the assistance of Mrs\r\nDrake, I got the use of a pony from Mr Obrion at a dollar a-day.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the wretched equipment of the pony, which was a\r\ngood one if it had been in condition. But it had run on the common and\r\nin the wood until caught for my use; its mane was almost a solid mass of\r\nburs, and its hairs so covered with eggs of the bot-fly, that they\r\nalmost changed the colour of the animal. It was without shoes; the\r\nsaddle, without girths, was held in its position by a belt passing over\r\nit; the stirrups and bridle harmonizing with the saddle.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance I rode over part of the Huron Indian Reserve with\r\nMr Clark, who had married a squaw of the Huron tribe, by whom he had a\r\nfamily, being originally an American, and having lived in comfort, since\r\nthe time of his marriage, on the Huron lands. Returning again to\r\nAmherstburgh, I rode down the shore of Lake Erie, after dinner, to Mr\r\n——’s, where I arrived about dusk. There was no stable for my pony, and\r\nit was turned into a field to shift for itself. Mr —— was unfortunately\r\nfrom home, and not expected for some days. I found this old settler, who\r\nhad been born in the country, living pretty much in the style of those\r\nwho had recently set themselves down, and I partook of homely fare, and\r\nslept on the floor. Here I met with a military gentleman of\r\nintelligence, whose name is connected with a beautiful island on Lake\r\nSimcoe, and who was in search of a desirable lot of land to fix on, to\r\nwhich he was entitled by his services. He expressed a wish to have my\r\nassistance in the selection, and offered such terms, that nothing but\r\nwant of time, and the advanced period of the season, prevented my\r\naccepting.\r\n\r\nNext morning I rose by daybreak, and caught my pony, on which I rode to\r\nthe hotel at the shipping place of Colborne iron works, kept by Mr Faux,\r\nfrom whom I hired a horse, to save my pony, for returning to\r\nAmherstburgh in the afternoon. I rode on Mr Faux’s horse to a prairie\r\nsome miles to the east of the iron works, which I had heard spoken of in\r\nhigh terms, and which I observed at some distance a month before. This\r\nprairie was understood to be for sale, and I called on the proprietor,\r\nwho was a kind, well-informed old gentleman, showing me personally over\r\nthe land, and regretting my inability to dine with him.\r\n\r\nI found the prairie in question to consist of peat earth, about a foot\r\nin thickness, on a wet sandy subsoil, intermingled with marl, which I\r\nwas able to distinguish by the aid of a spade, and test by vinegar. It\r\nwas of small size, very picturesque, and not likely to repay the expense\r\nof draining.\r\n\r\nI again mounted the pony at Mr Faux’s hotel, and reached Amherstburgh in\r\nthe evening, having examined four farms that were for sale in course of\r\nmy excursion. Time was now pressing me; and being anxious to see an\r\nindividual in Sandwich, and a form in the neighbourhood, I engaged Mr\r\nObrion to take me early in the morning to Sandwich in a cart.\r\n\r\nI called Mr Obrion out of bed some time after the hour he appointed to\r\nmeet me, and he was so long in getting every thing put to rights, that I\r\nwalked over the common on foot. He, however, soon overtook me; but\r\ndeclining to go beyond a pace faster than I could walk, I leapt from the\r\ncart, and proceeded on foot, breakfasting at a French inn, stopping at\r\nSandwich two hours, and bidding adieu to Canada, by crossing over to\r\nDetroit about noon.\r\n\r\nHaving, on my different visits to Canada, passed completely round the\r\npeninsula formed by the Thames river, Lake St Clair, Detroit river, and\r\nLake Erie, I shall describe the face of the country through which I\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Chatham for the south, the soil from that place to Lake Erie,\r\nwith exception of the plains already noticed, was clay of excellent\r\nquality, the surface level, and apparently wet near the margin. In\r\npassing up the shores of the lake, the soil was variable, being\r\nsometimes clay, and sometimes sand, the latter greatly preponderating.\r\nSome parts of the lake shore were unsettled, and scarcely a recent\r\nclearance was discernible. In the townships of Tilbury and Marsea, some\r\nfarms had been deserted, which had a most barren aspect, being overrun\r\nwith weeds, and scarcely producing a blade of grass.\r\n\r\nThe surface in the township of Gosfield, near the iron-works, differs\r\nfrom any seen in the peninsula, being undulating, and, in the language\r\nof the place, a handsome country. The land is not of the best quality,\r\nand for the first time in Canada, I walked over a gravelly soil.\r\n\r\nThe townships of Colchester and Maldon are not much above the level of\r\nthe lake, and the road passes through a sandy soil generally, and\r\nsometimes thin clay of bad quality. In the former there are oak\r\nopenings, the soil of which is poor sand. The soil of Maldon seems\r\nsuperior to that of Colchester, and improves, on approaching\r\nAmherstburgh, to the finest quality. In both townships there are a good\r\nmany people of colour, who generally rent the farms on which they\r\nreside, or obtain so many years’ possession, on condition of clearing a\r\ncertain extent of wood. A considerable quantity of tobacco is here\r\ngrown, chiefly by the black population.\r\n\r\nThe country from Chatham to Lake Erie in the township of Tilbury, and\r\nround the lake to Amherstburgh, seems badly watered, not having seen\r\nabove two rills passing into the lake. In Colchester and Maldon, there\r\nare occasionally stagnant branches of the lake, like canals or channels\r\nof a stream, jutting into the land to a considerable distance, and which\r\nI was told terminate in swamps, and prove the greatest, if not the only,\r\nnatural objection to the country.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Amherstburgh, on the river Detroit, commences a tract\r\nof country known by the name of the Huron Reserve, extending seven miles\r\nalong the banks of the river, and seven miles back from it.\r\n\r\nFor the first four miles of this Reserve, in passing from Amherstburgh,\r\nthe river, which is here perhaps the most beautiful in the world, is\r\nupwards of twenty feet below its banks, the soil a rich crumbling clay,\r\nand is one of the loveliest spots in Canada. Above this, the banks sink\r\nto the level of the river, and there is an extensive tract, six or seven\r\nmiles in length, and two or three in breadth, covered with tall aquatic\r\nplants, which impart a pestilential aspect to the country, and must form\r\none of the best nurseries in the world for ducks and mosquittoes. On\r\napproaching Sandwich, the banks again rise above the river, and maintain\r\ntheir elevation until a little above the ferry at Detroit.\r\n\r\nFrom the termination of the Huron Reserve to Sandwich, the soil on the\r\nriver is inferior, and the road, on entering the village, passes through\r\nwhat has originally been an oak opening of poor gravelly soil, and is\r\nstill covered with oak bushes, intermingled with inferior pasturage.\r\nAbove Sandwich the soil is good on the banks, and continues so as long\r\nas the elevation above the river is maintained. This part of the country\r\nis inhabited by the descendants of the French, and not a trace of the\r\noriginal forest remains.\r\n\r\nA mile or two above the ferry at Detroit, and approaching Lake St Clair,\r\nthe banks are low, and tracts of marsh fall back into the country.\r\nAround Lake St Clair there is some tolerable soil, elevated about two\r\nfeet above its waters, and a small wet prairie or two, besides that at\r\nthe mouth of the Thames. There are few settlers, scarcely a vestige of\r\ncultivation, and one or two recent clearings of insignificant extent.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river Thames are nearly on a level with the waters of\r\nLake St Clair, and gradually rise on approaching Chatham, where they are\r\nfifteen or twenty feet high. They have long been cleared of the forest,\r\ndescendants of French settlers residing below, and those of British\r\nLoyalists above. Both classes of inhabitants seem to cultivate only what\r\nis necessary to supply their wants, and have made no inroads on the\r\nforest or prairie for many years. The extent of cultivated land is\r\nlimited, and everywhere celebrated in Canada as the best in the world.\r\nThe soil on the south banks of the Thames, from Chatham to its mouth,\r\nvaries from the finest brown-coloured loam to indifferent sand, the\r\nformer being of limited extent. I do not mean to damn this favourite\r\nspot with faint praise, but while I admit there is some loam as good as\r\nman could wish, I contend it is not generally of such a description. No\r\ncompetent judge of soil need remain long in doubt on this point who\r\nvisits the situation, and I shall only particularize a field above Mr\r\nJohn Goose’s house, which was being fallowed when I was there, and which\r\nI pronounce not good soil. The state of the crops might be adduced in\r\nevidence of my opinion, especially that of Indian corn, which was not\r\nequal to that on some parts of the shore of Lake Erie, more especially\r\nthat belonging to John Macdonald.\r\n\r\nOf the land in the interior of the Peninsula, I am unable to speak, with\r\nexception of what was seen passing from Chatham to Lake Erie, and which\r\nI found of superior quality. I have already noticed that few running\r\nstreams join Lake Erie, and the same remark is applicable to Detroit\r\nriver and Lake St Clair. Several rivers are laid down on maps as flowing\r\ninto the south side of Lake St Clair, but at the time of my visit the\r\nmouths of all of them, with a single exception, were closed with sand on\r\nthe margin of the lake; and I could not determine whether their waters\r\nfiltered through the sand bars into the lake, or those of the lake into\r\nthe channels or canals running into the land.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the inhabitants in and around Amherstburgh and\r\nSandwich, the banks of Detroit river, Lake St Clair, and the mouth of\r\nthe Thames, are descendants of the French who settled in this part of\r\nthe country about the year 1670. They still retain the language,\r\nappearance, and many of the customs of their ancestors. Like the Lower\r\nCanadians, they seldom engage in commerce or manufactures, and settle\r\ntogether on long narrow lots of land, in streets or villages, and cut\r\ndown every forest tree. In Lower Canada the French population have no\r\norchards, except on the sides of the mountain at Montreal, but here\r\nalmost every settler on the Detroit river has an orchard. I did not\r\nobserve in the gardens of the French a single pear, plum, or peach-tree,\r\nbut apples were very abundant, and cider-presses frequently met with.\r\nThe inhabitants do not seem so light-hearted or polite a people as those\r\nof the lower province. They do not notice strangers in passing, and I\r\nonly observed two boys bow to me at Sandwich, while every man, woman,\r\nand child does so in the neighbourhood of Montreal. The houses are\r\ngenerally brick, and occasionally frame, but seldom with the stone\r\nbasement of the lower province. The beds of the inhabitants are\r\nsometimes without, and sometimes with, posts and curtains, and, in every\r\ncase which came under my notice, very clean.\r\n\r\nOn some parts of the river Detroit, Lake St Clair, and on the Thames,\r\nmany people reside literally amongst water, passing to and from their\r\nhouses on planks.\r\n\r\nThe French Canadians are said to be averse to clearing forest land, and\r\nperhaps as population increases, they prefer occupying swamps to\r\nclearing dry land. The appearance of the inhabitants residing in such\r\nsituations was unhealthy. Around Lake St Clair, the inhabitants seem to\r\nbe employed in preparing firewood for the town of Detroit.\r\n\r\nThe French inhabitants have a great dislike to service of any kind, and\r\nmore especially to females going out as cooks. The women seem\r\nindustrious, and often drive the produce of the farm to market in carts.\r\nSome children were seen running about in their shirts, as in Lower\r\nCanada, even when the weather was cold.\r\n\r\nThe French seem to have little system in their farming, growing wheat,\r\nIndian corn, and grass. They plough with oxen and a driver. The sheep\r\nare similar to those of the lower province, many of them being\r\nblack-coloured, with a little white on the face and neck. The oxen are\r\nof different colours, somewhat larger than those of Lower Canada, and\r\nmany of them are without horns. The horses are small, and perhaps not\r\nequal to those of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn several instances I examined a machine with which the French\r\ninhabitants were thrashing out grain. This was a beam twelve or fifteen\r\nfeet in length, with projecting spars like the spokes of a wheel,\r\nresting on the ground at one end, and rising with an elevation to suit\r\nthe draught of a horse at the other. The lower end of the beam was\r\nwithout spars, which increased in length according to the elevation. As\r\nthe horse moves in a circle, the beam revolves, which brings the spars\r\nsuccessively in contact with the grain spread on the floor, and by which\r\nmeans it was beat out from the straw.\r\n\r\nThis mode of separating grain from straw is evidently the first step\r\nfrom treading it out by animals, and is, perhaps, as old as the flail.\r\nAn economizer of labour would have strewed the gangway of the horse with\r\ngrain, so that it might have assisted in the operation, by treading with\r\nits feet. I have not been able to learn if this plan is known in France,\r\nor any other part of the world. It has not been adopted by the Americans\r\nor British Canadians, although it must be an assistance to, if not\r\ncalculated to supersede, the treading of animals.\r\n\r\nThe Huron tribe of Indians, residing near Amherstburgh, are few in\r\nnumber, extending only to ten or twelve families, and from their long\r\nintercourse with Europeans, most of the present generation seem to have\r\na mixture of white blood in them. They have long been Christians in\r\nconnexion with the Catholic church, and have adopted most of the habits\r\nof civilized life. They have orchards, numerous herds of cattle, horses\r\nand pigs; the cattle being the best I saw in the western part of Canada,\r\nand which I attribute to the superiority of the pasturage. On the 24th\r\nOctober, I observed a Huron Indian harrowing sown wheat with a\r\ntriangular harrow on as well formed ridges as any I saw in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Huron Indians were understood to have sold part of their reserve in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Amherstburgh to the British Government. Mr M—— had\r\nbeen appointed to survey the purchase, and with this view was residing\r\nat Amherstburgh during the time of my first visit. The Indians, under\r\nsome pretext, would not, however, allow the measurement to proceed, and\r\nMr M—— got orders from York to delay the survey.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Amherstburgh are anxious, almost clamorous, to have\r\nthe Huron Reserve, in the vicinity of the village, exposed for public\r\nsettlement, which would, in all probability, promote its increase and\r\nprosperity. It is not my intention to enter into the merits of the\r\npolicy of removing the Huron Indians from their situation on the\r\nsouthern part of their territory. But in the event of the lands falling\r\ninto the possession of the present inhabitants of Amherstburgh and its\r\nvicinity, I question if the change would be for the better, as the\r\nlandholders seem incapable of managing or appreciating the great\r\nadvantages nature hath placed within their reach. The white man strongly\r\ndisplays the frailty of his nature in envying this remnant of his\r\ncopper-coloured brother’s inheritance, while so many millions of acres\r\nin Canada are unoccupied.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the inhabitants on Lake Erie, in the townships\r\nof Maldon, Colchester, and the banks of the Thames, are descendants of\r\nthe Royalists who left the States at the time of their becoming\r\nindependent, and who obtained grants of land in Canada from the British\r\nGovernment. Like other colonists in this vast continent, who have been\r\nshut out in a great measure from intercourse with the world, they have\r\nbeen content to live without an apparent desire to improve their\r\ncondition. Their extent of clear forest is limited, and few additions\r\nhave recently been made. The dwelling-houses and farm-offices are of the\r\nshabbiest kind, and only two brick houses were seen in a distance of\r\ntwenty-seven miles, passing from Amherstburgh round Lake Erie. A brick\r\nhouse is also a rare sight on the Thames, wood being almost the only\r\nbuilding material.\r\n\r\nIn this part of Canada, farming is as low as in newly settled districts,\r\nand embraces the cultivation of wheat, oats, peas, Indian corn, and\r\ntobacco—wheat and Indian corn being the chief crops. In many instances\r\nwheat had been sown amongst growing Indian corn, and ploughed in between\r\nthe drills. This is an excellent plan, the wheat being well advanced\r\nwhen the Indian corn is reaped. Oxen are employed in ploughing\r\ngenerally, and all operations are performed in a superficial manner. I\r\nobserved a crop of buck-wheat being carried in the township of Gosfield,\r\non 24th October. Two horses were attached to a sleigh, and two men on\r\nthe ground were building small sheaves on the sleigh with their hands,\r\nneither of them having a pitchfork. A trifling load was taken off the\r\nfield, attended by the two men already mentioned; and after being upset,\r\na man and two boys placed it in the barn. The carrying of this crop\r\nwould have been effected at one-fourth of the labour in Scotland, where\r\nthe division of farm labour is properly understood. Extensive orchards\r\nare everywhere met with, and the crop of apples was immense, so much so,\r\nthat they sometimes remained ungathered. The horses, oxen, sheep, and\r\npigs in this part of Canada are all inferior in kind; and if such a\r\nthing as a good sized horse can be found either for the saddle or\r\ndraught purposes, which I very much doubt, it must have come from the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe implements of husbandry are such as are common to the country.\r\nSeveral grist-mills are propelled by oxen walking on an inclined plane,\r\nand are very poor machines. A good many grist-mills are also propelled\r\nby wind, chiefly amongst the French inhabitants on the shores of Detroit\r\nriver and the lakes, and also some by oxen or horses attached to a large\r\nwheel, moving horizontally a few inches from the ground. I was given to\r\nunderstand a steam-power grist-mill was about to be erected at Sandwich,\r\nby a capitalist lately arrived in the country, and I imagine will be\r\nchiefly employed in grinding wheat from the States.\r\n\r\nThe trees do not materially differ from those in other parts of Canada,\r\nwith exception of sweet chestnut being common on the shores of Lake\r\nErie. This tree is generally found on poor sandy soil, and seems to\r\noccupy the place of the pine in the districts to the north and east. In\r\npassing round Lake St Clair, I thought I observed the pawpaw growing\r\nnear the commencement of Detroit river, but the plants being small, I\r\ncould not determine their identity. Future travellers may be better able\r\nto settle this point, as I scattered some seeds of the pawpaw, which\r\nwere in my pocket, and which I gathered in Ohio a few days before.\r\n\r\nThe turkey is said to inhabit this district in considerable numbers, and\r\nthe boy who conducted us out of Chatham plains told me he had come on a\r\nhen and her brood a short time before, but this bird was not seen by me.\r\nThe pheasant and quail are numerous, and so tame that you may approach\r\nwithin a few yards of them on open ground. Ducks of various kinds\r\ninhabit the waters, and more especially Detroit river, in vast numbers;\r\nand many of the species are so tame, that, schoolboy like, I pelted them\r\nwith stones in open water without their taking wing. Several kinds of\r\ngeese also frequent the waters, but it is only in autumn, when they and\r\nducks congregate in such numbers, preparatory, perhaps, to moving south\r\nfor the winter.\r\n\r\nBirds of prey are numerous. Near the mouth of the Thames I observed a\r\nbald eagle perched on a decayed tree, and which was the only one I saw\r\nin Canada. Buzzards were seen frequently, gliding gracefully in circles,\r\nand in company, though at considerable distances from each other. Many\r\nhawks of different sizes, and small eagles, were observed on the shore\r\nof Lake Erie, sitting inactive on trees, or fighting with each other\r\nabout a favourite resting-place. On one occasion, near Chatham, a hawk\r\nsingled out a small bird for its quarry which frequents the banks of the\r\nThames, without the power of swimming. The little creature was above the\r\ncentre of the river when attacked, and avoided a death-blow by diving\r\nunder water with a shrill cry. It no sooner, however, left the element\r\nthan the hawk made a second swoop, which was again avoided by going\r\nunder water, and by a succession of dives and flights, it at last found\r\nshelter amongst some bushes on the banks. There are vast numbers of what\r\nare here called blackbirds, consisting of two kinds, and both highly\r\ndestructive to the farmer, devouring almost every species of produce,\r\nand especially Indian corn; they breed amongst reeds, and find the\r\nmarshes of the Detroit an excellent cover. There are squirrels of\r\nvarious kinds, striped, black, and brown; the former live in the ground,\r\nand the two latter are occasionally shot and used as food. Racoons are\r\noften hunted, and valued on account of their skins.\r\n\r\nThe river Detroit issues from Lake St Clair, and falls into Lake Erie,\r\nafter a south-west course of about twenty-eight miles. The waters of the\r\ngreatest lakes in the world, Superior, Huron, and Michigan, pass through\r\nthe channel of the Detroit, which, at the narrowest point, is about 800\r\nyards wide, and above as well as below this place, expands several miles\r\nin breadth. The current seems to run at a rate of between two and three\r\nmiles an hour, and the water is as limpid as that of the purest spring,\r\nexcept when slightly tinged with earth, caused by the waves during a\r\ntempest. The largest steam-vessels pass up at all times, and navies\r\nmight contend on its waters.\r\n\r\nThe village of Amherstburgh is situated near the confluence of Detroit\r\nriver with Lake Erie, opposite to a small island, between which and\r\nAmherstburgh the main body of water passes. The houses are almost\r\nentirely of wood, arranged into streets at right angles with each other,\r\nand almost all bespeaking poverty and meanness. There are Catholic,\r\nEpiscopalian, and Presbyterian places of worship, besides schools, and\r\nthe population is about 500. Most of the inhabitants are of French\r\ndescent. Trade is very limited, and thought to be declining. Every\r\nvessel passing up and down the Detroit comes within 100 yards of the\r\npier, which is at all times accessible to the largest class. Fort\r\nMaldon, a paltry mud erection, is situated on the banks of the Detroit,\r\nabout half a mile from the village, and the military reserve around the\r\nfort, which is the best of pasturage, is occupied as common.\r\nAmherstburgh is one of the oldest places in Canada, situated in its\r\nfinest climate, the best British port on Lake Erie, and in beauty and\r\nhealthiness of situation, inferior to no place in America; yet every\r\nthing, with exception of two handsome residences below the town, seems\r\nin a state of listless decay. I have no doubt there are better days in\r\nstore for Amherstburgh.\r\n\r\nSandwich is also on the Detroit, sixteen miles above Amherstburgh, and\r\nderives its only importance from being the county town. The houses\r\ncompose an irregular street, running along the river, and chiefly\r\noccupied by French. The trade of Sandwich is more limited than that of\r\nAmherstburgh, and I do not think it has the same chance of progressing.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half above Sandwich is the ferry at Detroit, at which\r\nthere are fifteen or twenty houses on the Canadian side of the river,\r\nand several brick buildings were being erected at the time of my visit.\r\nThis place will soon eclipse Sandwich, and may rival Chatham. Detroit is\r\nthe great market of Western Canada, and the ferry possesses advantages,\r\nin proximity and access during winter, above every other situation.\r\nSince leaving Montreal, I had seen no place bearing the marks of age and\r\nwealth, and the town of Detroit, situated on the magnificent river of\r\nthe same name, ranks next to that city in appearance; and in recalling\r\nold-country associations, forms a striking contrast to the poverty and\r\nlifelessness of Amherstburgh and Sandwich, on the opposite side of the\r\nriver. Lofty spires and large brick buildings are seen in the distance;\r\nsteam-vessels, and engine-stalks, employed in manufactures, on a near\r\napproach. A fine large steam-boat leaves Detroit daily for Buffalo, and\r\nsmaller ones for less distant places on the north and south. Now and\r\nthen a steam-boat plys to Chicago and other places on Lake Michigan, and\r\nin course of a year or two it is probable there will be a daily line of\r\nboats. There are three streets running parallel to the river, and many\r\nat right angles. The houses in the principal streets are of brick. The\r\npopulation exceeds 3000 souls, the greater part of whom are of French\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Detroit to Chicago—Thrashing Machine—Face\r\n    of the Country in Michigan—Prairie Hen—White Pigeon\r\n    Prairie—Travelling Party—La Porte—Cooking Breakfast—Jaded\r\n    Horses—Thunder Storm—Hovel on the Shore of Lake Michigan—Face\r\n    of the Country—Notices of Nature—Chicago—Indian\r\n    Treaty—Horse-racing—Intoxication—Fair—Occurrences at Chicago._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 13th September, I left Detroit, early in the morning, in a stage\r\nfor Niles, which was drawn by four horses, and well filled with\r\npassengers. We breakfasted at the distance of twelve miles, the hotel\r\nbeing a solitary house, the name of which has escaped my memory.\r\n\r\nHere I examined a thrashing-machine, worked by four horses, attached to\r\nthe ends of two rough poles moving two small horizontal wheels, a few\r\ninches from the ground, round one of which was a leather belt moving in\r\na wood case, and connected with the drum or beater placed in the barn.\r\nThe machinery in the barn consisted simply of a beater, without rollers,\r\nshaker, or fan. The board over which the grain slides to the beaters,\r\nhad a few upright spikes, which formed the only detaining power to the\r\ngrain while passing the beaters. This machine would not cost more than\r\nL.8 sterling, but its imperfections in shaking and fanning, as well as\r\nin beating out the grain, which I discovered on examination, render the\r\nsaving of first-cost injudicious.\r\n\r\nOur roads, for the first stage or two, were very bad, and perhaps\r\naffected the passengers, eight in number, who did not exchange\r\nhalf-a-dozen words during the first day. In course of the second day, a\r\nfew short questions were put and answered, and on our arrival at Niles,\r\non the evening of the third day, nothing like familiar intercourse had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nNiles is a small place on the river St Josephs, and said to be twelve or\r\nfourteen miles from Lake Michigan. In our route from Detroit, we had\r\npassed through the territory of Michigan, in a south-westerly direction,\r\ncrossing most of the rivers, near their source, which flow into Lakes\r\nErie and Michigan; and I experienced considerable disappointment at the\r\ngeneral aspect of the country, which, with the exception of about\r\ntwenty-five miles next to Detroit, was found to consist of oak openings.\r\nThe soil is chiefly sand, and exhibits few marks of fertility. The trees\r\nare stunted oaks, of about thirty feet in height, and so thinly\r\nscattered, that a man may frequently clear an acre in a day. The surface\r\nis gently undulating, and, from the thinness of the trees, and frequency\r\nof streams, lakes, and fairies, highly picturesque. The lakes sometimes\r\nassume the character of marshes, and many of them contained small\r\neminences, or islands, covered thickly with trees of a different species\r\nfrom those growing on another, at a few yards distant, or on the margin\r\nof the marsh. The district is still very thinly settled; and in passing\r\nalong, I wondered what had become of all the people who of late years\r\nhave been pouring into Michigan from the eastern states, forgetting the\r\nextent of territory, and that it has become the common route for\r\nsettlers moving to the fertile and extensive tracts lying to the south\r\nand west of Lake Michigan. The houses, with the exception of those in\r\nvillages, are mere log-huts.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at White Pigeon, on the third morning of our journey, at\r\na well-regulated hotel, where some broiled ruffed grouse, called, in the\r\nlanguage of the country, prairie-hen, was presented at table, and in\r\npraise of which, some of our taciturn fellow-passengers became\r\nloquacious. The particulars of the discussion may have been highly\r\nvaluable, but I was too busily employed in displaying my opinions by\r\nactions, to note down the conversation.\r\n\r\nWhite Pigeon is a small pretty village, composed of well-painted\r\nframe-houses, and in neatness and apparent comfort resembling some of\r\nthe residences in New England. It is situated on the skirts of White\r\nPigeon prairie, one of the most beautiful and fertile prairies in\r\nMichigan, and to which, perhaps, the whole territory is indebted for\r\nmuch of its celebrity.\r\n\r\nWhite Pigeon prairie is an interesting spot to those who have long\r\nlooked on the interminable forests and small clearances of Canada, being\r\na level surface of many miles extent, thickly interspersed with good\r\nfarm-houses and barns. To me the change was truly gratifying, and gave\r\nrise to a thousand associations connected with other parts of the world.\r\nAn old farmer from New England, on his way to join a son in Illinois,\r\ncould not contain himself, and exclaimed,—“Surely this must have been\r\nthe place where Adam and Eve resided.”\r\n\r\nOn examining the soil of White Pigeon prairie, I found it composed of\r\nblack gritty sand, thickly interspersed with glittering particles of\r\nspar. The inclosures were large, and without ridges. The crops had been\r\ngathered, with the exception of Indian corn, which seemed good. The\r\nweeds growing on the surface were of no great strength, amongst which\r\nwere two kinds of grass. I did not observe sown grasses or clovers, and\r\nthe latter does not grow naturally. It is said many English farmers are\r\nsettled on White Pigeon prairie, who have good thrashing-machines. There\r\nis a small prairie to the east of White Pigeon, and a large one to the\r\nwest, through both of which we passed. These prairies do not seem fully\r\noccupied, and the land is said to sell at from $3 to $6 per acre,\r\ngovernment price being $1¼.\r\n\r\nThe ruffed grouse, or prairie-hen, abounds on White Pigeon and the\r\nadjoining prairies, to which some gentlemen resort for the purpose of\r\nshooting. This bird resembles in colour the female pheasant of Britain,\r\nand the black-cock in size and shape.\r\n\r\nWhile walking in the garden of the hotel at White Pigeon, the experiment\r\nI wished my friend to try in the Huron tract at Goderich, was made on\r\nmyself. A wasp stung me on the eyelid, and did not cause much pain, but\r\nI cannot draw any inference from this regarding the properties of the\r\nAmerican wasp, as a sting from such insects in Britain did not create\r\ninflammation at any period of my life.\r\n\r\nAt Niles we changed our stage-coach for an open waggon drawn by four\r\nhorses, which was the first time a regular stage had passed from Niles\r\nto Chicago, the mail having hitherto been carried on horseback. The\r\nwaggon and horses were to carry us through all the way, as proper posts\r\nand relays had not been established on the road. We breakfasted before\r\nsetting out, and a guide was sent with our driver.\r\n\r\nOur travelling-party was somewhat changed from that which had come from\r\nDetroit. Three of our original passengers remained; one an Englishman,\r\nMr L——, who had been twelve months in the western states, and now on his\r\nway back, after an excursion to the southern and eastern states of the\r\nUnion, was accompanied by Mr D——, a young gentleman, who, from his\r\npronunciation of the English language, I imagined from Germany; the\r\nthird was W——, from Detroit, an officer in the United States army, and\r\nthe most prim individual I encountered in the course of my travels. He\r\nseemed as if carrying the dignity and honour of the whole army on his\r\nshoulders, and I could not help remarking how very repulsive he was to\r\nhis countrymen who ventured to address him. America may be the land of\r\nliberty and equality, but, personally, no one seemed equal to Major W——,\r\nand certainly liberty could not be taken with him. The rest of our\r\npassengers consisted of an old revolutionary soldier and his wife, on\r\ntheir way to join a son settled in Illinois, a Michigan farmer, myself,\r\nwaggoner, and guide.\r\n\r\nThe farmer was originally from York State, now settled on Nottawa Sepee\r\nprairie, on St Joseph’s river, and proceeding to Chicago, where an\r\nadjustment of Indian claims was taking place, in the hope of obtaining\r\nrecompense for losses. I had not an opportunity of learning the result\r\nof his mission, but from his own statement, it did not merit success. He\r\ntold us he intended to have _made_ a great deal of pork this season, but\r\non collecting his pigs from the woods, where they had run for five\r\nmonths, he could only number thirty-five instead of fifty-five. The\r\nIndians had been seen hunting pigs, and he expected to get payment from\r\nthe government agent for twenty of his which were missing. In this\r\nmanner the poor Indian is preyed on by his white frontier brother, and\r\nmade pay for the ravages of disease, wild animals, and perhaps the\r\ndishonesty of white men.\r\n\r\nIn our first day’s journey we dined at La Porte, a small rising place,\r\nsituated in a rich prairie country, and on the margin of Clear Lake, a\r\nbeautiful and picturesque sheet of water, said to be eight miles from\r\nLake Michigan. We stopped for the night at Clavering. The house was a\r\nmean log erection of two apartments, one of which contained five beds,\r\nin which nine travellers huddled together, and the other apartment, from\r\nthe number of the family, must have been equally well filled.\r\n\r\nOur party collected at daybreak, when we set out on our journey, the\r\npoor horses, not having got any thing but hay—oats, or Indian corn, were\r\nnot to be had. The road, leading through forests, was so heavy, that the\r\npoor animals could not go beyond a slow walk, and I proceeded forward,\r\nin company with the Nottawa Sepee farmer, with a view of ordering\r\nbreakfast for the party.\r\n\r\nOn reaching a house, we were told it would be some time before breakfast\r\ncould be prepared, as we had not been expected. The inmates of the house\r\nconsisted of a female and her two young daughters, whom the farmer and I\r\nassisted in preparing wood for cooking. A kettle and two frying-pans\r\nwere put on the fire, and two others over some ashes, removed from the\r\ngeneral mass by means of a shovel, and placed on the hearth. Into one of\r\nthese pans some small loaves were placed, which had been prepared\r\nbeforehand, and covered with a lid, on which hot ashes were placed; and\r\nin the other, batter-cakes, called flap-cakes, were prepared. In one of\r\nthe frying-pans on the fire bacon was dressed, and in the other\r\npotatoes; so, in less than half-an-hour, a breakfast of the best the\r\nhouse could afford was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe horses again fared poorly, getting a few ears of green Indian corn,\r\ncollected from the field, and we were told oats would be obtained at the\r\nend of six or seven miles. We accordingly found this to be the case, a\r\nsmall feed for each was granted, and a supply to carry with us denied.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting, a French Canadian from the Lower Province, engaged\r\nin trading with the Indians, joined us; and for five or six miles,\r\nbefore reaching Lake Michigan, the road was through undulating oak\r\nopenings of loose heavy sand, over which I walked. We reached the lake\r\nto the west of its most southerly point, and distinctly saw the shore\r\nrunning north on each side of us. The beach along which our road lay was\r\nso soft, that almost all the party walked to ease the horses, who showed\r\nunequivocal symptoms of distress. It was now about nightfall, and our\r\nguide from Niles, who had carried the mail over the country, assured us\r\nwe were twenty-eight miles from the nearest house. It appeared to me\r\ndoubtful if the tired animals could accomplish the journey under any\r\ncircumstances, and hopeless to think of them doing so with all the\r\npassengers in the waggon. I therefore proposed to walk the distance, and\r\nset out with such a view by myself; but reflecting that I was altogether\r\nunacquainted with the country, and might pass the resting-place without\r\nnoticing it, I left the shores of the lake, and botanized on the sand\r\nhills until I could no longer distinguish plants.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the waggon, the party were all reseated, with the\r\nexception of the Nottawa Sepee farmer and Indian trader, and I could not\r\nrefrain from remarking the want of feeling evinced by some of the\r\ngentlemen in oppressing the horses, then moving at the rate of three\r\nmiles an hour, dead to the whip, and occasionally coaxed on with water\r\nin a pail. The evening was agreeably cool, the moon and aurora borealis\r\nshone in splendour, and the ripples of the lake, and the wheels of the\r\nwaggon, passed without noise on the smooth beach. By and by, the sound\r\nof distant thunder was heard rolling—on the waters flashes of lightning\r\ncould be distinguished, and at length the clouds from which both\r\nproceeded came directly over our heads, accompanied by torrents of rain.\r\nAt this time the farmer and trader also betook themselves to the waggon,\r\nand I continued to walk on foot. It is impossible for me to convey in\r\nwords a correct impression of our situation. Peal after peal of thunder\r\nfollowed each other for two successive hours. The lightning was so\r\nvivid, that every flash deprived me of vision for a few seconds, and,\r\nunable to see the way, I laid hold of the waggon with one hand. The\r\nhorses seemed unwilling to proceed, and the guide was mounted on one of\r\nthe leaders to urge them along. At this time the wind had sprung up, and\r\nthe rain fell in such torrents, that, on turning my back to the storm, I\r\ndistinctly felt water running in streams on the surface of my skin.\r\n\r\nThe horses at length stood still—no means could make them move; and all\r\nthe passengers, with exception of the old soldier and his wife,\r\ndescended from the waggon. Five of us, Mr L——, Mr D——, the farmer,\r\ntrader, and myself, resolved to make the best of our way on foot, and\r\nthe others remained with the waggon. The gentlemen having had cloaks and\r\numbrellas to protect them from the rain while in the waggon, were\r\ncomparatively dry. The moon had set, and fortunately the night cleared\r\nup at the time of commencing our walk. Mr L——, who was a tall athletic\r\nperson, in the prime of life, led the way at an exterminating pace over\r\nthe soft sand, followed by the farmer and others. It soon became evident\r\nto me, that no frame could last at the rate we were going. Mr D—— and\r\nthe trader dropped astern, the former gave place to me, and at length Mr\r\nL—— proposed to breathe on the trunk of a tree. Mr L——’s proposal was\r\nmost agreeable to me, having walked ten hours in course of the day\r\nbefore setting out with Mr L——; and I afterwards heard the farmer say,\r\nin conversation, that had it not been for the honour of his country, he\r\nwould not have continued to walk with the Europeans. Mr D—— and the\r\ntrader had not been seen for an hour before. We shouted to them in vain,\r\nand at the end of ten minutes continued the journey at our former pace.\r\nWhen resting a second time, Mr D—— and the trader passed us, both\r\nmounted on one horse, which they obtained from an Indian known to the\r\ntrader.\r\n\r\nAt three in the morning, we observed a light, which, on approaching, was\r\ndiscovered to be a lantern, with which Mr D—— was gathering potatoes in\r\na garden with his fingers, as the only means of removing them from the\r\nearth, and the trader was bawling in a hovel for whisky. On entering the\r\nhovel, two young girls and a boy, half Indian and half something else,\r\nwere reposing in a corner, each wrapped in a blanket; and on seeing so\r\nmany strangers, they all rose hurriedly and left the house. Some oats\r\nwere sent off by the Indian who owned the horse for the waggon horses,\r\nand a small piece of bread and some whisky were obtained for ourselves.\r\nMr L—— and Mr D—— soon took possession of the corner and blankets, which\r\nthe girls had abandoned; and I was amused to see these individuals, who\r\nhad evidently been long familiar with the luxuries and refinements of\r\nEuropean society, accommodate themselves to circumstances, and take\r\npossession of a sleeping place, which, in cleanness and softness, was\r\ninferior to the bed of many an East Lothian pig. The farmer and trader\r\nsoon followed their example, and I was left standing by the fire drying\r\nmy shirt, after accomplishing which, I stretched myself alongside of the\r\ntrader, and was asleep in an instant.\r\n\r\nAt five the waggon and the rest of the party arrived, and at seven we\r\nagain set out, and reached Chicago in time for a late breakfast; the\r\ncountenances of all bore evidence of the fatigues of the preceding\r\nevening, and my limbs felt them. The old soldier had drunk too freely on\r\nhis arrival at and departure from the hut, and his ravings while under\r\nintoxication in praise of republicanism and General Jackson, as well as\r\nin censure of England, were amusingly absurd. His wife seemed to feel\r\nfor her husband’s conduct, and the influence both of the driver and\r\nMajor W—— was scarcely sufficient to keep him in order.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Niles, we crossed by a ford the river St Joseph’s,\r\nwhich seemed to me to contain rather more water than the largest sized\r\nrivers in Britain. For miles on both sides, the country is uninhabited,\r\nand seems to combine the features of forest oak openings and prairie,\r\nthe trees being small, thin, and standing in groups, so as to produce\r\nthe best effect, often reminding me of the finest English parks. Six or\r\nseven miles from St Joseph’s river, the prairie country commences, and\r\ncontinues with little intermission to the westward as far as the country\r\nhas been explored. On the southern margin of Lake Michigan, there is a\r\nrange of sand hills, from 100 to 200 feet in height, apparently formed\r\nby the drifting of sand from the beach, and the same character is\r\nmaintained up the west side of the lake, although the elevations are\r\nquite inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe country from the river St Joseph’s, round the south side of Lake\r\nMichigan, with exception of a small spot, belonged, at the time of my\r\nvisit, to the Pottowatamy tribe of Indians. This tract, extending to\r\nabout 6,000,000 of acres, was sold by the Pottowatamys to the United\r\nStates Government a few days after I passed over it, and is now in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the country from Niles to Chicago is limited to a few\r\nprairies in the vicinity of La Porte, on which wheat and Indian corn are\r\ncultivated in the most primitive manner. Here, as in the western part of\r\nCanada, the farmers seemed contented to live. There were no barns seen\r\nany where; and at Clavering the wheat was thrashed in the open air, on\r\nthe bare earth, and the fanners were standing covered with a little\r\nstraw. The Indian corn was still growing. In one instance, I observed\r\nwheat newly sown, and a field of this crop above ground. The crop of the\r\nyear was in small, ill-built, unthatched ricks, resembling in size and\r\nshape the hay cokes of Scotland. At Clavering I examined the prairie\r\nwheat crop, and found the ears small in size, the straw short and\r\nslender; the grain was particularly small, but of fine colour and\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe wood is chiefly oak. The summits of sand hills on Lake Michigan are\r\ncrowned with a few stunted pines, a tree which, I believe, is not to be\r\nfound farther to the south of this point, or west of the grand river in\r\nUpper Canada, although abounding in some districts on the north-west\r\nshores of Lake Michigan. Nearer the beach, and at a lower level than the\r\npines, dwarfish poplars grow, two species of bent grass, and a thistle.\r\nA few vines were also on the sand hills, and when not growing in very\r\nexposed situations, were lying on the banks as if trained on a wall; but\r\nafter a diligent search, I could not discover fruit on them. The sand\r\nhills were thinly clothed with vegetation, and every plant, with\r\nexception of the grasses, seemed stunted like those exposed to the spray\r\nand storms of a British ocean. In this part of the country, I made a\r\nlarge addition to my collection of seeds, which were wrapped in small\r\nfolds of paper, dried in my pocket, and afterwards transferred to my\r\nknapsack.\r\n\r\nI observed no animals that appeared new to me. In some parts squirrels\r\nwere particularly numerous, and exclusively of the black variety.\r\n\r\nWhile walking on the sand hills on the south point of Lake Michigan, I\r\nobserved a small hawk pursue a bat, similar to that of Britain. The bat\r\ndexterously avoided three swoops of the hawk, seemingly without much\r\nexertion or concern, and both were hid from vision behind a bank in the\r\nfourth attack. I had frequent opportunities of seeing birds of prey\r\nattack their game while in America, without witnessing a successful\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nChicago is situated on Lake Michigan, at the confluence of Chicago\r\nriver, a small stream, affording the advantages of a canal to the\r\ninhabitants for a limited distance. At the mouth of the river is\r\nFort-Dearborn, garrisoned by a few soldiers, and one of the places which\r\nhas been long held to keep the Indian tribes in awe. The entrance from\r\nthe lake to the river is much obstructed by sand banks, and an attempt\r\nis making to improve the navigation.\r\n\r\nChicago consists of about 150 wood houses, placed irregularly on both\r\nsides of the river, over which there is a bridge. This is already a\r\nplace of considerable trade, supplying salt, tea, coffee, sugar, and\r\nclothing to a large tract of country to the south and west; and when\r\nconnected with the navigable point of the river Illinois, by a canal or\r\nrailway, cannot fail of rising to importance. Almost every person I met\r\nregarded Chicago as the germ of an immense city, and speculators have\r\nalready bought up, at high prices, all the building-ground in the\r\nneighbourhood. Chicago will, in all probability, attain considerable\r\nsize, but its situation is not so favourable to growth as many other\r\nplaces in the Union. The country south and west of Chicago has a channel\r\nof trade to the south by New Orleans; and the navigation from Buffalo by\r\nLake Huron is of such length, that perhaps the produce of the country to\r\nthe south of Chicago will find an outlet to Lake Erie by the waters of\r\nthe rivers Wabash and Mamee. A canal has been in progress for three\r\nyears, connecting the Wabash and Mamee, which flows into the west end of\r\nLake Erie; and there can be little difficulty in connecting the Wabash\r\nwith the Illinois, which, if effected, will materially check the rise of\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nAt the time of visiting Chicago, there was a treaty in progress with the\r\nPottowatamy Indians, and it was supposed nearly 8000 Indians, of all\r\nages, belonging to different tribes, were assembled on the occasion, a\r\ntreaty being considered a kind of general merry-making, which lasts\r\nseveral weeks; and animal food, on the present occasion, was served out\r\nby the States government. The forests and prairies in the neighbourhood\r\nwere studded with the tents of the Indians, and numerous herds of horses\r\nwere browsing in all directions. Some of the tribes could be\r\ndistinguished by their peculiarities. The Sauks and Foxes have their\r\nheads shaven, with exception of a small tuft of hair on the crown. Their\r\ngarments seemed to vary according to their circumstances, and not to\r\ntheir tribes. The dress of the squaws was generally blue cloth, and\r\nsometimes printed cotton, with ornaments in the ears, and occasionally\r\nalso in the nose. The men generally wore white blankets, with a piece of\r\nblue cloth round their loins; and the poorest of them had no other\r\ncovering, their arms, legs, and feet being exposed in nakedness. A few\r\nof them had cotton trowsers, and jackets of rich patterns, loosely\r\nflowing, secured with a sash; boots, and handkerchiefs or bands of\r\ncotton, with feathers in the head-dress, their appearance reminding me\r\nof the costume of some Asiatic nations. The men are generally without\r\nbeards, but in one or two instances I saw tufts of hair on the chin,\r\nwhich seemed to be kept with care, and this was conspicuously so amongst\r\nthe well-dressed portion. The countenances of both sexes were frequently\r\nbedaubed with paint of different kinds, including red, blue, and white.\r\n\r\nIn the forenoon of my arrival, a council had been held, without\r\ntransacting business, and a race took place in the afternoon. The\r\nspectators were Indians, with exception of a few travellers, and their\r\nsmall number showed the affair excited little interest. The riders had a\r\npiece of blue cloth round their loins, and in other respects were\r\nperfectly naked, having the whole of their bodies painted of different\r\nhues. The race-horses had not undergone a course of training. They were\r\nof ordinary breed, and, according to British taste at least, small,\r\ncoarse, and ill-formed.\r\n\r\nIntoxication prevailed to a great extent amongst both sexes. When under\r\nthe influence of liquor, they did not seem unusually loquacious, and\r\ntheir chief delight consisted in venting low shouts, resembling\r\nsomething between the mewing of a cat and the barking of a dog. I\r\nobserved a powerful Indian, stupified with spirits, attempting to gain\r\nadmittance to a shop, vociferating in a noisy manner; as soon as he\r\nreached the highest step, a white man gave him a push, and he fell with\r\nviolence on his back in a pool of mud. He repeated his attempt five or\r\nsix times in my sight, and was uniformly thrown back in the same manner.\r\nMale and female Indians were looking on and enjoying the sufferings of\r\ntheir countryman. The inhuman wretch who thus tortured the poor Indian,\r\nwas the vender of the poison which had deprived him of his senses.\r\n\r\nBesides the assemblage of Indians, there seemed to be a general fair at\r\nChicago. Large waggons drawn by six or eight oxen, and heavily laden\r\nwith merchandise, were arriving from, and departing to, distant parts of\r\nthe country. There was also a kind of horse-market, and I had much\r\nconversation with a dealer from the State of New York, having serious\r\nintentions of purchasing a horse to carry me to the banks of the\r\nMississippi, if one could have been got suitable for the journey. The\r\ndealers attempted to palm colts on me for aged horses, and seemed versed\r\nin all the trickery which is practised by their profession in Britain.\r\n\r\nA person showed me a model of a thrashing-machine and a churn, for which\r\nhe was taking orders, and said he furnished the former at $30, or L.6,\r\n10s. sterling. There were a number of French descendants, who are\r\nengaged in the fur-trade, met in Chicago, for the purpose of settling\r\naccounts with the Indians. They were dressed in broadcloths and boots,\r\nand boarded in the hotels. They are a swarthy scowling race, evidently\r\ntinged with Indian blood, speaking the French and English languages\r\nfluently, and much addicted to swearing and whisky.\r\n\r\nThe hotel at which our party was set down, was so disagreeably crowded,\r\nthat the landlord could not positively promise beds, although he would\r\ndo every thing in his power to accommodate us. The house was dirty in\r\nthe extreme, and confusion reigned throughout, which the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances of the village went far to extenuate. I contrived,\r\nhowever, to get on pretty well, having by this time learned to serve\r\nmyself in many things, carrying water for washing, drying my shirt,\r\nwetted by the rain of the preceding evening, and brushing my shoes. The\r\ntable was amply stored with substantial provisions, to which justice was\r\ndone by the guests, although indifferently cooked, and still more so\r\nserved up.\r\n\r\nWhen bed-time arrived, the landlord showed me to an apartment about ten\r\nfeet square, in which there were two small beds already occupied,\r\nassigning me in a corner a dirty pallet, which had evidently been\r\nrecently used, and was lying in a state of confusion. Undressing for the\r\nnight had become a simple proceeding, and consisted in throwing off\r\nshoes, neckcloth, coat, and vest, the two latter being invariably used\r\nto aid the pillow, and I had long dispensed with a nightcap. I was awoke\r\nfrom a sound sleep towards morning, by an angry voice uttering horrid\r\nimprecations, accompanied by a demand for the bed I occupied. A lighted\r\ncandle, which the individual held in his hand, showed him to be a French\r\ntrader, accompanied by a friend, and as I looked on them for some time\r\nin silence, their audacity and brutality of speech increased. At length\r\nI lifted my head from the pillow, leant on my elbow, and with a steady\r\ngaze, and the calmest tone of voice, said,—“Who are you that address me\r\nin such language?” The countenance of the angry individual fell, and he\r\nsubduedly asked to share my bed. Wishing to put him to a farther trial,\r\nI again replied,—“If you will ask the favour in a proper manner, I shall\r\ngive you an answer.” He was now either ashamed of himself, or felt his\r\npride hurt, and both left the room without uttering a word. Next\r\nmorning, the individuals who slept in the apartment with me, discovered\r\nthat the intruders had acted most improperly towards them, and the most\r\nnoisy of the two entered familiarly into conversation with me during\r\nbreakfast, without alluding to the occurrence of the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Chicago, I learned there was a mail-waggon which passed\r\ndown the Illinois river once a-week, and had set off a few hours before,\r\nand was the only conveyance in that direction. I could not think of\r\nremaining a week waiting for the waggon, and not finding a suitable\r\nhorse to purchase, I determined on walking. The passengers who had\r\ntravelled together from Niles, lodged at the same hotel, with exception\r\nof the Major, who perhaps found shelter in the fort. The old soldier\r\nseemed to have commenced a regular fuddling fit; and his wife, who was a\r\nprudent sensible person, was in great distress, being thirty miles from\r\nthe residence of her son, and her husband quite uncontrollable. Finding\r\nthe destination of the old lady lay no great way out of my route, I\r\nhired a waggon to take the old people and myself there next morning, the\r\nsoldier having been easily coaxed into the arrangement, and for which\r\nhis wife expressed thankfulness. On the waggon reaching the door of the\r\nhotel, its owner, who was of French descent, insisted that he had only\r\nbargained to convey two, and that unless he received $2 from me, I must\r\nremain behind. After a noisy altercation on both sides, he offered to\r\naccept of $1 extra, but feeling indignant at his attempt at imposition,\r\nI shouldered my knapsack, and trudged off on foot. I have often looked\r\nback with regret on this proceeding, as it was improper to leave the old\r\nlady without seeing her fairly on her journey, and silly to have\r\nexchanged high words with an individual who would altogether disregard\r\nthem. This was the only instance which occurred to me in the States, of\r\nexperiencing an attempt at imposition, or which was calculated to ruffle\r\nmy temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Chicago to Springfield—Oak Plains—Travellers—Crowded\r\n    House—DuPage—Benighted—Clatterman’s—Ottawa—Family from New\r\n    England—Travellers—Gouging—Sleeping Accommodation—Peoria—Pekin\r\n    Storekeeper—Saltcreek—Hospitality of\r\n    Inhabitants—Springfield—Prairies—Notices of Nature—Face of the\r\n    Country—Soil—Agricultural Notices._\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Chicago at ten in the morning of the 19th September: rain having\r\nfallen, rendered the prairie difficult to walk on, especially when the\r\nsoil was wet. A number of Indians were travelling in different\r\ndirections, and also heavy waggons, some of the attendants of which\r\ncarried guns for the purpose of shooting on the journey.\r\n\r\nI dined twelve miles from Chicago, at a hotel on the river Oak Plains, a\r\nstream on which people were engaged in erecting a mill, and the waters\r\nof which were competent to propel machinery of moderate power. On asking\r\nthe workmen if the stream flowed into Lake Michigan, they answered, “It\r\njoined the Illinois, although in time of high freshets it sometimes\r\ncrossed the plains to the Chicago concern.” This is evidence of the\r\nlevel surface of this part of America; the river Oak Plains, after\r\nrunning in a southerly direction for half a degree of latitude, takes a\r\nwesterly course at a point twelve miles from Chicago, and only a few\r\nfeet above the level of Lake Michigan, and its waters join the sea at\r\nNew Orleans, while those of the lake flow into the Gulf of St Lawrence.\r\n\r\nWhen crossing the Oak Plains, five or six geese alighted in the stream,\r\nand I stood and saw a young man shoot one of them, who pointed out the\r\nproper road across the prairie, which had become doubtful by two or\r\nthree diverging in different directions. While in the middle of the\r\nprairie, two Indian men and a boy, the former with guns over their\r\nshoulders, and the latter with a bow, perfectly naked, with exception of\r\na piece of blue cloth round their loins, and a few quills twisted into\r\ntheir hair, approached me, and whom I saluted with a nod of the head.\r\nThey spoke in a language which I did not comprehend; they seemed equally\r\nunsuccessful with me; and we parted, smiling at the fruitlessness of our\r\nattempts. When nearly across the prairie, after passing the river, a\r\nwaggon overtook me, in which were two young men, who offered me a seat,\r\nwhich I readily accepted. On learning the route I had travelled, they\r\nparticularly enquired about the waggons I had passed between Detroit and\r\nChicago, as they expected their parents to be then moving from New\r\nEngland to join them in Illinois, and were anxiously looking for their\r\narrival. After riding about a mile we came to a tavern called the\r\nDoctor’s, inhabited by a practitioner of medicine, getting the\r\nappellation of Doctor, although in all probability not holding a\r\ndiploma.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, on our arrival, was drawing water from a well built with\r\nstones, which is uncommon in this part of the country, few people taking\r\nso much pains to keep their water free of mud. The travellers acted as\r\ntheir own ostler. On entering the house, which was a small log hut of\r\none apartment, I found a wife, four or five children of different ages,\r\nand two travellers, one of whom was called squire, which is, I believe,\r\nsynonymous with judge, and corresponds with justice of the peace in\r\nBritain. For some time I was puzzled to conceive where we were all to\r\nsleep, and at length four of us were shown up a ladder into a garret, or\r\ncock-loft, in which there were two beds. I took possession of one in\r\npartnership with the squire, who told me, before going to sleep, that he\r\nhad lately suffered much from fever, and finding himself unwell, he had\r\nstopt here for the night, instead of proceeding to Chicago. On rising at\r\ndaybreak, I found two travellers sleeping on the floor at the foot of\r\nthe ladder. The Doctor, his wife, and two children, lying in bed in the\r\nordinary way, and other two children lying across their feet. After\r\nseeing the exertions made by this family to accommodate strangers, and\r\nthe consequent uncomfortableness of their own situation, I felt thankful\r\nfor the poor half bed allotted me, and in course of my travels duly\r\nappreciated the most homely fare and accommodation, when it was the best\r\nmy entertainers could supply.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants in this part of the country reside on the skirts of the\r\nprairie, for the convenience of obtaining fire and fencing timber, and I\r\nfelt hungry before getting across a large one, after setting out from\r\nthe Doctor’s. Here, as in some parts of Canada, there are few taverns,\r\nbut almost every inhabitant entertains travellers for payment. On\r\nentering the first house I reached, two well-dressed, genteel-looking\r\nwomen were sewing at a window, one of whom said she could not furnish\r\nbreakfast without some inconvenience, and on apologizing for mistaking\r\nher house for a tavern, she directed me to one about a mile distant,\r\nnear the banks of the river Du Page. After partaking of breakfast, I\r\nexamined a mill on the river, and again faced a prairie, the limits of\r\nwhich were beyond the reach of vision. The day was extremely warm, and I\r\nsauntered slowly along, collecting seeds of the various plants, and\r\nwashing my feet in the different streams I had to wade without my\r\nstockings and shoes, by way of excusing myself from exertion under so\r\nhot a sun. At length I met two travellers in a vehicle, who asked me how\r\nfar they were from the next house. After replying, I put the same\r\nquestion, and was told twenty-five miles. At this time the sun was\r\nsinking towards the horizon. I had no alternative but to push on, and as\r\nevening approached, got into my best pace. Night, however, set in before\r\nI could discern the forest at the termination of the prairie, and while\r\nruminating on the still seclusion which surrounded me, I was cheered by\r\nthe faint barking of a dog. The road diverged into two lines, and\r\ndarkness prevented me selecting the most beaten path, when the\r\nappearance of a light in the distance decided the choice. I was now in\r\nhigh spirits at the near prospect of terminating my walk, and\r\ndisregarded getting off the tract I had chosen, still keeping straight\r\non the light, which recalled to memory the song of “the Beacon light” I\r\nhad often heard sung by my youngest sister. Whatever may have been the\r\ndegree of interest excited by scenes and occurrences in a foreign land,\r\nthe associations connected with my birthplace never failed to impart the\r\nmost grateful and soothing emotions, and I had seldom been placed in\r\ncircumstances so favourable to such enjoyment. “The Beacon light”\r\nsuggested a thousand recollections which thrilled upon my soul; and as\r\nthey flitted across my memory, I proceeded with an elastic step,\r\nwhistling the air to which the words of the song are set, when I\r\nsuddenly found myself up to the middle in water. There was sufficient\r\nlight to enable me to see my situation was not attended with danger; and\r\nafter wading for a hundred yards or two, and scrambling over a rail\r\nfence, I found myself on dry land. On applying at the house, the light\r\nof which had long attracted my notice, I was received for the night, and\r\nfound three or four waggoners sitting down to supper, of which I partook\r\nwithout much solicitation. The travellers slept in a different house\r\nfrom the family, and each had the luxury of a single bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning I breakfasted before setting out, and assisted my host, of\r\nthe name of Clatterman, to brand some oxen, of which he had nearly\r\nforty, with a proportionate share of other agricultural wealth. In the\r\nmiddle of the prairie I met about a dozen of horses, in charge of three\r\nindividuals, one of whom was particular in his enquiries regarding\r\nChicago, to which he was journeying to dispose of his horses. Like most\r\ntraffickers, he lost no opportunity of attaining his end, and asked me\r\nto purchase one. Having walked upwards of forty miles the previous day,\r\nunder unfavourable circumstances, and not feeling in the least degree\r\nfatigued, I determined to persevere walking for some time longer. Coming\r\nin contact with the river Illinois, about half a mile above its junction\r\nwith the Fox river, I waded across a channel of freestone, where there\r\nwas a considerable sized island of the same rock, covered with wood. On\r\nreaching the south side of the river, I walked down the banks, and dined\r\nat Ottawa, a place of three or four houses, a little way below the mouth\r\nof Fox river, and likely to grow into a city, from being at the head of\r\nthe navigation of the Illinois. Pursuing my journey until nightfall, I\r\nmade application for a bed at a house which was filled with travellers\r\nand fever patients, and the owner recommended me to proceed four miles\r\nfurther on. By the light of the moon I was enabled to cross the river\r\nVermilion by a sort of embankment for changing the direction of the\r\nstream for mill purposes, and got under the roof of a New Englander, who\r\nhad lately come to this part of the country. The family consisted of the\r\nold pair, two handsome young women, and a male visitor, whose bed in the\r\ngarret I shared. Every thing in the house was particularly clean and\r\nneat. The manners of the inmates were calm and dignified, a smile never\r\nplaying on their countenances, or an emphatic sound proceeding from\r\ntheir lips. For tea, bed, and breakfast, the charge of 1s. ½d. sterling,\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nNext day I applied for dinner at a house where a poor man was suffering\r\nmuch from sickness, and medical assistance had been called in. The\r\nfamily were about to sit down to a good dinner, of which I partook,\r\npaying 6¼d. sterling. Night closed on me while in the middle of a\r\nprairie, and I felt some apprehension of passing the cottages, which are\r\nnot easily discovered in a faint light, being almost invariably situated\r\na few yards in the forest, and of the same dark shade. A breeze, highly\r\ntainted with the scent of fried pork, led me to expect a house, and to\r\nwhich a light, proceeding from a half-opened door, served to guide me. I\r\nfound four travellers, the landlord, and his wife, assembled in a poor\r\nhabitation, lighted by what they termed a string, or piece of twine,\r\ndipt in tallow, and which gave a glimmering light, so that we could\r\nscarcely distinguish objects. There seemed to be only three tea-cups in\r\nthe house; the party had, consequently, to feed by turns, and, being a\r\nstranger, I was requested by all to seat myself at the first table, an\r\nhonour to which my appetite led me to make no serious objection.\r\n\r\nOne of the travellers was descended from the original French, a little\r\nmerry fellow, speaking indifferent English, and two others consisted of\r\nan old man and his son, originally from Kentucky. Both of these\r\nindividuals differed in their language and manners from most of the\r\npeople I had come in contact with since leaving Canada. The old man\r\nspoke a good many words according to negro pronunciation, and both were\r\naddicted to swearing. The son, about thirty-five years of age, was one\r\nof the best-looking and finest formed men I met in America. I soon\r\ndiscovered he was slightly intoxicated, and a most profligate character.\r\nBeing anxious to shun conversation with him, I was annoyed at his\r\nplacing his chair beside mine; and as there was neither another house\r\nnor apartment to retire to, I endeavoured to make the most of my\r\nsituation. Having replied to his enquiry what countryman I was, by\r\nasking him to guess, he successively said, Dutchman, German, Englishman,\r\nand Irishman, and fearing he might lose patience, I at last told him a\r\nScotchman. He had never heard of Scotchmen before, and insisted I must\r\nbe one of the Scotch-Irish, which I afterwards learnt means, in this\r\npart of the world, the inhabitants of the north of Ireland. The\r\ndiscussion about Scotch-Irish suggested the proudest feat of his life.\r\nHe said Jim Partridge was an Irishman, able to whip any man in America,\r\nand who must have been heard of in my country. He had a whipping-match\r\nwith Jim, who fell, and was in act of being gouged, when the bystanders\r\nlifted him off Jim, who, seizing a stick, cut his head with it in a\r\ndreadful manner. Gouging is performed by twisting the fingers into the\r\nhair of the victim, and with the thumb forcing the eye out of its\r\nsocket. This savage act has long been known in Kentucky and some of the\r\nwestern states, and was often resorted to when parties quarrelled. It is\r\nnow, however, confined to the lowest blackguards, and of rare\r\noccurrence. The eyes of the wretch sparkled with delight when relating\r\nthe prostrate situation of Jim, and the prospect of gouging him, and he\r\nexplained his brutal attempt by placing his fingers in my hair and on my\r\nface, when I could scarcely trust his intentions. He also insisted that\r\nI should feel the indention made by Jim’s stick, and I thought his skull\r\nmust have been as hard as his heart to have withstood such a blow.\r\n\r\nThe house was in all respects a mean one, containing little furniture,\r\nand two beds, from one of which rose an emaciated person, labouring\r\nunder aberration of mind, and to whom the house and lands adjoining\r\nbelonged. I began to feel uneasy about the sleeping accommodation, as\r\nboth beds would be required for the family, and there was no garret\r\napartment. The landlord at length drew forth from the corner of the room\r\na dirty tick and covering, which were placed in the middle of the floor,\r\nand formed the sleeping place of five individuals, who arranged\r\nthemselves latitudinally on the pallet. I was anxious for an outside\r\nberth, in order to have sea-room in case of accident, but the\r\ncomplaisance of the gouger deprived me of this position, and I found\r\nmyself placed for the night between the old man and his son. None of the\r\ntravellers thought of unrobing; and after putting off my shoes, I laid\r\nmy head on my knapsack, which was the only thing in shape of a pillow to\r\nbe had. My situation was far from enviable; fumes of whisky and squirts\r\nof tobacco juice assailing me on every side, and I considered the\r\npartner of my bed more savage than the wolf of the forest. Speedily\r\nfalling into a profound sleep, from which I was awoke at daybreak by the\r\nFrenchman searching for his saddle, the horrors of my situation flashed\r\non my mind, and I stealthily crawled from the bed, my movements being\r\naccelerated by the gouger muttering an ugly oath.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the outside of the door, the freshness of the air was\r\ndelightful. The sky was cloudless, and in walking through the trees, the\r\nparoquets fluttered from their resting-places with a shrill cry. On\r\nreaching the opposite side of the wood, herds of cattle were seen\r\nstreaming from the forest, and the smoke of the morning fires ascending\r\nin graceful columns, undisturbed by the serene atmosphere. The\r\nprairie-hen rose from the pathway with a purring noise, and the little\r\ngophers stood on end, and seemed to regard me as an intruder. The sun\r\npeered above the prairie, as if rising from the ocean, and gilded the\r\nnodding sunflower, whose brilliancy was heightened by dewdrops sparkling\r\non the blossom leaves, and with which I washed my face. Nature was\r\ndecked in a winning garb, and the events of the previous evening were\r\nforgotten in wooing her beauties.\r\n\r\nOn entering a house at the end of the prairie, I found every thing neat\r\nand clean, and two well-dressed females cheerfully provided breakfast.\r\nOne of them was in delicate health, and had lately come from the Du\r\nPage, where she left a coloured man in charge of her establishment,\r\nabout whose health she felt anxiety, as almost every one on the river\r\nhad been afflicted with fever. It so happened that I had called at this\r\nlady’s house for the purpose of enquiring the way, which was pointed out\r\nby the coloured man, who was then in good health.\r\n\r\nWhen about to partake of breakfast, I was joined by a traveller in a\r\nlight car, who passed me on the previous evening, and he expressed\r\nsurprise to find me before him, having gone a mile off the direct road\r\nto escape passing the night in the house in which I lodged. He resided\r\nat Pekin, and had come direct from Chicago, which he left about six\r\nhours after me, and had travelled at what he considered a good pace. He\r\nasked me to take a seat in his car, and we travelled together twelve or\r\nfourteen miles on the wooded banks of the Illinois till opposite Peoria,\r\nwhen we crossed the river in a ferry-boat, leaving the horse attached to\r\na tree.\r\n\r\nPeoria takes its name perhaps from the tribe of Indians called Peorias,\r\nand which is now almost extinct. It is situated on a lake, or an\r\nexpansion of the river, two miles wide, and four or five in length, at\r\nsome elevation above the water, and commanding a view of the lake and\r\nfine wooded banks on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe village exhibits marks of considerable age, but none of prosperity.\r\nI found the dinner hour past, and fared indifferently. There being\r\nnothing to attract attention at Peoria, I recrossed the ferry, where the\r\nhorse was still standing, and bent my way to Pekin, which I reached a\r\nlittle before sunset.\r\n\r\nPekin, sometimes called Pekin-on-the-hill, is situated on the Illinois,\r\nand is progressing rapidly. The hotel was filled with permanent\r\nboarders, who seemed to be engaged in the different mechanical arts. The\r\nlandlord was crawling about the house in a debilitated state, and\r\nevidently a fever patient. The people assembled at table addressed me by\r\nthe name of stranger, and showed considerable attention; a female, as\r\nusual, filling out tea.\r\n\r\nFor three days past I had been without shoe-ties, both having broken\r\nafter leaving Chicago, the bark of trees having since then been\r\nsubstituted. I made application for a supply at different stores in\r\nPekin, without success. In one instance I found the storekeeper\r\nstretched at full length, with his back on the counter, and his feet\r\ntouching the roof. At first I did not observe him, as the light from a\r\ncandle was faint, and I was surprised at hearing human sounds proceeding\r\nfrom such an unseemly thing. He answered my enquiries regarding\r\nshoe-ties dryly, without altering his position. On retiring I purposely\r\nleft the door of the store open, with the view of rousing him from his\r\nunelegant posture. My stratagem did not, however, succeed, and I began\r\nto think the individual might be a philosopher engaged in study, instead\r\nof a demi-savage, which his behaviour at first led me to suppose.\r\n\r\nOn retiring to bed, I was deposited in a pretty huge apartment,\r\ncontaining seven or eight beds, some of which were occupied by sick\r\npeople, and others were passing to and fro, at all hours of the night. I\r\nrose early in the morning, and bent my course towards Springfield, in\r\nSangamon county, leaving the river Illinois to the westward. I applied\r\nfor breakfast, at an early hour, at a solitary house, which an overgrown\r\nyoung woman readily supplied, baking bread and stewing a fowl in a very\r\nshort space of time, for which she charged well. In course of\r\nconversation, I learned her husband was from the State of New York, and\r\nhad lived sometime in Indiana. Her children were evidently unhealthy,\r\nand she said sickness was no great misfortune, as it was so easy to get\r\na living in the country. After breakfast I passed several small prairies\r\nand the river Mackinaw, when I entered on a large and uninhabited one,\r\nsixteen miles across. The day being very warm, I felt a good deal\r\nfatigued, and was anxious to obtain dinner and shelter from the sun, but\r\non gaining the only house on the road, I was told the whole family were\r\nsick, and it was impossible for me to obtain dinner. I proceeded to a\r\nhotel on Salt creek, which I reached with scarcely sufficient light\r\nremaining to distinguish the house.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the hotel, Mr Music, was from home, and two daughters\r\nand a son did the honours of the house. These people seemed in good\r\ncircumstances, having a well-stocked farm and abundance of Indian corn.\r\nOn my arrival, I was asked whether I would have bread of Indian corn or\r\nwheat, and all seemed surprised to hear I had never tasted the former.\r\nTwo other travellers on horseback arrived, and bread of both kinds was\r\npresented at table.\r\n\r\nOne of the travellers was on his way to Galena, for the purpose of\r\ngetting payment of horses he had sold some time before. He was\r\noriginally from Kentucky, and now resided in the neighbourhood of\r\nJacksonville. His manners were somewhat rough, and with this individual\r\nI had much conversation. At first he was most anxious to engage me as a\r\nfarming-help, admitting that he himself had become too lazy to work\r\nhard, and pressed me again and again to name my terms. To him and others\r\nwho wished my assistance as farming-help, I uniformly expressed\r\nthankfulness for their kindness, and assured them that circumstances did\r\nnot admit me to reside in the country. Before separating, he offered me\r\na letter to his wife, who would give me free board at his house till he\r\nreturned, and his sons would drive me over the adjoining country. I took\r\ndown his address and left him, with a promise to visit Mrs Taylor if\r\ntime permitted me.\r\n\r\nThe travellers breakfasted at Salt creek before setting out on their\r\njourney, which is good policy in thinly settled districts. The day was\r\nexcessively warm, and I suffered considerably from thirst. On passing a\r\ncottage, before reaching Sangamon river, a girl was drawing water, from\r\nwhom I asked a drink; she went into the house and brought a tumbler,\r\nwhich she filled with indifferent water, and handed over the rails. When\r\nabout to depart, a woman of prepossessing appearance came to the door,\r\nand asked me to enter the house and shelter myself from the sun. I\r\nthanked her, and in return, said I was anxious to reach Springfield in\r\ntime for dinner. She told me her husband, who was sick, liked above all\r\nthings to converse with travellers, and hoped for his sake I would enter\r\nthe house. There was something so earnest in the woman’s manner that I\r\nwould have found difficulty in resisting her entreaties at any time, and\r\non the present occasion my inclination yielded a willing assent.\r\n\r\nThe husband was stretched on a clean uncurtained bed, and appeared in a\r\nmost debilitated state. He brightened up by degrees, and showed he\r\npossessed a good deal of information. He was particular in his enquiries\r\nabout Ottawa, on the river Illinois, to which he had some thoughts of\r\nremoving, as he had resolved to leave his present situation, where he\r\nhad resided for six years, on account of the scarcity of water. His\r\nhealth and that of all his family had been good until the present time,\r\nwhen he was seized with fever, which he thought the doctor had broken.\r\nHe regretted that his weakness could not stand cooking meat in the\r\nhouse, but if I could partake of other food, his wife would place it\r\nbefore me. A snow-white cloth was spread on the table, followed by\r\nbread, milk, butter, and preserved fruits of excellent quality, and to\r\nwhich I did justice. On departing, I received an invitation to call at\r\nthe house if ever I passed in the direction. Soon afterwards, crossing\r\nthe Sangamon river in a boat, although the stream was not more than\r\neighteen inches deep, I reached Springfield about two o’clock.\r\n\r\nDinner was readily promised at the hotel, although past the regular\r\nhour, and in the meantime I prepared to wash and shave. On asking for a\r\nbedroom, the landlord personally brought water, and on a second\r\napplication, soap and a mirror. I had now discovered that I also wanted\r\na towel, and at last, conscious of the impropriety of keeping the master\r\nof the house running up and down stairs on my account, I moved off to\r\nthe pump-room and apologized for my past conduct, on the score of being\r\na stranger in the country, and unacquainted with its customs. I had no\r\ncause to regret this proceeding, the landlord being remarkably attentive\r\nduring my stay, pointing out what was worthy of notice, and offering his\r\nhorse to visit them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I passed two individuals conversing on the prairie, to\r\nwhom I nodded, a practice universal in all country places of the States\r\nI visited. After proceeding a short distance, one of the persons\r\novertook me, and commenced conversation. “Sir, you are a\r\nEuropean?”—“Yes.”—“And an Englishman?”—“No; I am a Scotchman.”—“You are\r\nat a great distance from your own country?”—“I am, but the sight of this\r\nbeautiful one has repaid me for the journey.”—“You are a mechanic?”—“No;\r\nI have been a farmer from my youth upwards.”—“What induced you to come\r\nhere?”—“We farmers in Scotland, finding ourselves uncomfortably\r\nsituated, desire to emigrate to this country, the accounts of which\r\nbeing contradictory, I resolved to see it personally.” The old gentleman\r\ndescended from his horse, with sparkling eyes, shook me by the hand,\r\nsaying, “In me you have found a friend.” There was something in the\r\nman’s expression and warmth of manner so unexpected in this part of the\r\nworld, that I asked if he was from Scotland. He said his name was\r\nHumphries, originally from Pennsylvania, his parents being of Welsh\r\nextraction. I was pressed to pass the night at his house, and on\r\ndeclining to do so, agreed to breakfast with him next morning.\r\n\r\nI found the old gentleman, and what I supposed two daughters, expecting\r\nmy arrival. The house contained several apartments, in one of which were\r\nsome dozens of books on a shelf. Mr Humphries appeared verging on\r\nseventy. We walked over the farm, and after partaking of excellent\r\nmelons, I took leave about noon, much gratified with my visit, and with\r\nthe kindest invitations to visit him or his family at a future period.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the hotel, I learned that two Scotchmen had called for\r\nme, Mr D—— and Mr B——, and I rode across a prairie, after dinner, to see\r\nMr D——, at his steam saw-mill on the Sangamon river. On my return to\r\nSpringfield, I spent the evening in company with two ladies from New\r\nEngland, and one from Scotland. They agreed in thinking Illinois a hard\r\ncountry for women and cattle, as helps could not always be had. My\r\ncountrywoman smiled at my objections to the slave states, and maintained\r\nthe coloured population were not human beings, but inferior animals\r\ncreated for slavery. It was painful to hear a lady advance such\r\nopinions, who in youth must have imbibed very different sentiments and\r\nprinciples, and I attributed the change she had undergone to her\r\nresidence in a slave state, and affording in herself an instance of the\r\nevils of slavery. Her observations required from me a reply; and the\r\nsubject dropt, on my remarking there were many white slaves in the\r\nworld, some being slaves to their passions, and others to their\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nSpringfield is an irregular village of wooden houses, containing about\r\n1200 souls. It is three miles from Sangamon river, which is only\r\nnavigable for small boats at the melting of the snow in spring. There\r\nare good stores of all descriptions in the village.\r\n\r\nThe word prairie is derived from the French, and signifies meadow. In\r\nAmerica it means grass-land naturally free from timber, and is used in\r\nthis sense by me. Prairies have not been found in the eastern parts of\r\nNorth America, and many conjectures exist regarding their origin in the\r\nwest. The general opinion is, they originated from, and owe their\r\ncontinuance to, the agency of fire. It is quite certain fire sweeps over\r\nthem, at present almost every autumn, destroying the entire vegetation\r\non the surface; but whether proceeding from human or natural agency\r\nremains unsolved, and it probably arises occasionally from both. The\r\nburning must destroy seedling-trees, which would otherwise perhaps\r\noccupy the whole surface by the wafting of seeds; and the continuance of\r\nprairies may be, in many instances, owing to fire, but after having seen\r\nthem in all situations, it does not seem to account satisfactorily for\r\ntheir origin. Prairies of a few yards’ extent are found in the midst of\r\ndense and extensive forests, and rows of trees jutting miles into the\r\nopen country, without visible agency to account for their preservation.\r\nFire cannot be supposed to have originated the first case, nor the\r\nabsence of it the last, as it is seldom so partial in its effects. I\r\nhave no theory to offer instead of fire for the origin of prairies,\r\nwhich seem productions of nature. The localities of plants are often\r\nfound to be partial, and Britain exhibits furze, heath, grasses, and\r\ndifferent species of trees, exclusively occupying the surface of certain\r\nparts as natural productions. In America, trees vary in number on a\r\ngiven space, from the dense forest to the oak opening, with half-a-dozen\r\nof trees to an acre. Unless it be maintained that nature has allotted a\r\ncertain number of trees to a given extent of surface, it will be idle to\r\ndeny her handiwork in having formed oak openings and prairies, which are\r\nmet with in all situations, and which often seem to merge into each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMy friends in the Canadas used every argument to dissuade me from\r\njourneying to the junction of the rivers Mississippi and Missouri. They\r\nrepresented the country through which I intended passing as a\r\npestilential swamp, inhabited by demi-savages and dangerous animals. If,\r\nperchance, I escaped disease and enemies, I would become low-spirited in\r\nthe wilderness, and to proceed alone and unarmed, would be little short\r\nof insanity. But how different was the result! With the companionship of\r\nnature, and the God of nature as my protector, want of company and fear\r\nwere unfelt, and I regard my wanderings on the prairie as the most\r\npleasing and instructive period of my existence.\r\n\r\nHaving reached Chicago with an unsocial party of travellers, and\r\ngradually passing from the forests and oak openings of Michigan, it was\r\nnot until after crossing the river Des Plaines that I became fully\r\nsensible of the beauty and sublimity of the prairies. They embrace every\r\ntexture of soil and outline of surface, and are sufficiently undulating\r\nto prevent the stagnation of water. The herbage consists of tall grass,\r\ninterspersed with flowering plants of every hue, which succeed each\r\nother as the season advances. The blossoming period was nearly over at\r\nthe time of my journey. Sunflowers were particularly numerous, and\r\nalmost all the plants had yellow blossoms. Every day brought me in\r\ncontact with species formerly unobserved, while others with which I had\r\nbecome familiar, disappeared. Occasionally, clumps of trees stood on the\r\nsurface, like islands in the ocean. The bounding forest projected and\r\nreceded in pleasing forms, and the distant outlines appeared graceful. I\r\nhad no time for searching out and studying scenery, and perhaps\r\nconceptions of beauty and grouping of trees, formed in the artificial\r\nschool of Britain, are inapplicable to the magnificent scale on which\r\nnature hath adorned the country between Chicago and Springfield. The\r\nworks of man are mere distortions compared with those of nature, and I\r\nhave no doubt many prairies, containing hundreds of square miles, exceed\r\nthe finest English parks in beauty as much as they do in extent.\r\nSometimes I found myself in the midst of the area without a tree or\r\nobject of any kind within the range of vision, the surface, clothed with\r\ninteresting vegetation around me, appearing like a sea, suggested ideas\r\nwhich I had not then the means of recording, and which cannot be\r\nrecalled. The wide expanse appeared the gift of God to man for the\r\nexercise of his industry; and there being no obstacle to immediate\r\ncultivation, nature seemed inviting the husbandman to till the soil, and\r\npartake of her bounty. Mr Malthus’s doctrine, that population increases\r\nfaster than the means of subsistence, appeared more than doubtful, and\r\ninvolving the unhallowed thought of a Being of infinite goodness and\r\npower leaving man, a favoured object of creation, without the means of\r\nsubsistence. If a considerable portion of mankind ever are in want of\r\nfood, the cause will be found to arise from human agency, and not from\r\nnature refusing to do her part. I felt grateful at beholding a field so\r\nwell fitted to relieve the depressed and starving population of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, while the conduct of their land-owning and\r\ntithe-eating legislators, in restricting the circulation of nature’s\r\nbounty, appeared sinful.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed, that fire passes annually over the\r\nprairies, which may perhaps account for the absence of clovers and\r\nfibrous-rooted grasses, the herbage consisting chiefly of three or four\r\ntall growing species, the creeping roots of which escape destruction,\r\nand continue to exist without renewal from seed. At this advanced period\r\nof the season, the coarse withered grass seemed unpalatable to animals,\r\nand the cattle were, generally, browsing on parts which had been burned,\r\nwith a view of affording a succession of nutritious food. I collected\r\nthe seeds of many plants without knowing any thing of their usefulness\r\nor beauty. On the banks of Meadowcrow creek, a small tributary of the\r\nriver Illinois, I first met the indigenous hop, apparently identical\r\nwith that of England, and from the Sangamon brought the leguminous and\r\nearth seeds of _Glycine Monica_, a species of hazel exceeding four feet\r\nin height, and indigenous to the whole extent of country through which I\r\ntravelled on the American continent, and which commonly fringed the\r\nprairie, and graduated the change from forest to open plain. They were\r\nloaded with small nuts, which sometimes satisfied my hunger.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous of birds were the ruffed grouse, or prairie-hen\r\nalready described. They frequent roads, particularly in the morning,\r\nperhaps to escape from the effects of dew, and with the aid of a gun, I\r\nmight have shot many hundreds of them without leaving the pathway. On\r\nthe skirts of the forest around Springfield, quails, or partridges as\r\nthey are called in the language of the country, are abundant, and so\r\ntame, that they might have been killed with stones. Notwithstanding the\r\nnumber of such birds, Illinois cannot boast of gamekeepers, and I only\r\nobserved one individual shooting grouse. Many cranes, swans, ducks, and\r\nwild-geese, were seen hovering above the prairies, and on different\r\noccasions I disturbed owls reposing amongst withered grass. The forests\r\nabounded with green coloured paroquets, which fluttered about with a\r\ndisagreeable noise, in flocks of six or seven.\r\n\r\nDeer were frequently seen bounding across the plain, and prairie wolves\r\nskulking amongst the tall grass. The prairie wolf is a small animal, not\r\nmuch larger than the fox of Britain, and whose habits are not widely\r\ndifferent. In forests on the banks of the river Illinois, grey coloured\r\nsquirrels were extremely numerous, and seemed actively engaged in\r\ncollecting nuts, with which the ground was strewed. Near Pekin I walked\r\na mile or two with a person returning from shooting squirrels, and who\r\nbestowed four or five on a woman who asked them for a sick boy. In\r\nCanada, the colour of the squirrel is red; in Michigan, black; and in\r\nIllinois, grey. The gopher is a red-coloured quadruped, in size and\r\nshape resembling the weasel of Britain. It burrows in the prairies,\r\nforming passages, and throwing up earth like the mole. It subsists on\r\nvegetables, and is sometimes a source of annoyance to the farmer. I was\r\ntold it is furnished with pouches for carrying earth from its\r\nexcavations.\r\n\r\nThe wild bee was the most numerous of insects, and crowded the few\r\nremaining blossoms of the sunflower. They live in the hollows of\r\ndecaying trees, and a considerable quantity of their honey is collected\r\nby the inhabitants. In the Canadas, the maple-tree supplies saccharine\r\nmatter, and in Illinois, where this species of plant is rare or unknown,\r\nthe bee forms the chief source of this commodity. Thus, the maple, bee,\r\nand cane, contribute the same ingredient to man, and are illustrative of\r\nthe economy and diversity of nature.\r\n\r\nThe country from Chicago to Springfield, through which I passed, may be\r\ntermed prairie, the portion of forest land being quite inconsiderable.\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of these villages, the surface is nearly\r\nlevel, and in the intermediate space, sufficiently undulating for\r\nusefulness and beauty. The forest trees on the margins of the prairie\r\nare of small size, and chiefly oak; those on bottom, or interval, land,\r\non the banks of rivers, are of immense size. Forests generally clothe\r\nthe banks of streams, but sometimes prairies descend to the water’s\r\nedge, on both sides, and no general rule can be laid down for the\r\nprevalence or want of timber. After crossing the river Des Plaines,\r\nthere was no indication of marsh or wetness of soil, and I only observed\r\none lake, of very small extent. Rocks were not seen protruding above the\r\nsurface, although stones of considerable size were observed on the\r\nwayside. The beds of the rivers Des Plaines, Du Page, and Vermillion, at\r\nthe places where I crossed, were strewed with stones. The freestone\r\nrock, seen in crossing the Illinois, and of which a considerable sized\r\nisland was composed, was observed for several miles below in the\r\nchannels of tributary streamlets. I examined seams of coal on the banks\r\nof the river Sangamon, in the vicinity of Springfield. My view was\r\nimperfect, as the seams had never been worked. They appeared about two\r\nfeet in thickness, of bituminous quality, and fifteen feet above the\r\nlevel of the river. A contract was entered into at the time of my visit,\r\nto furnish coal, by removing the incumbent earth, at three cents per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this district embraces almost every description, from poor\r\nsand to rich clay of strong texture. It is of all colours, and generally\r\nof superior quality. The poorest soil was on the banks of the Sangamon,\r\nthe richest on those of the Illinois. The black sand, of which the\r\nprairies are partly composed, seems of a penetrating nature, and adheres\r\nto the skin like soot. Before being aware of this circumstance, I\r\nmarvelled at the filthy appearance of some of the inhabitants, who did\r\nnot wear stockings, and at evening I sometimes found my feet and ankles\r\ncoated with black dust, after having been washed half a dozen times, in\r\ncourse of the day, in wading streams. The burning of the herbage\r\nprevents the accumulation of vegetable matter on the soil, and the\r\ncreepingrooted grasses, with which it is occupied, perhaps exhaust\r\nrather than enrich it. First crops are seldom too luxuriant, and land is\r\nsaid to improve after the breaking up of the prairie.\r\n\r\nAgriculture embraces the growth of wheat and Indian corn and the rearing\r\nof live stock; but, from the limited number of inhabitants, the\r\ncultivated fields form a mere speck on the surface of the prairie. The\r\nwheat stubbles in the neighbourhood of Springfield betokened luxuriant\r\ncrops, and the height and thickness of Indian corn filled me with\r\namazement. At the date of my visit, 23d September, most of this crop had\r\nbeen severed from the earth, and was standing in conical piles on the\r\nfield, where it remains during winter, or until such time as it is\r\nwanted. There are many kinds of Indian corn, differing widely in habits\r\nof growth, and I was unable to determine whether the uncommon luxuriance\r\nof that in this district was owing to a particular variety, or\r\ncongeniality of soil and climate, but I supposed the latter.\r\n\r\nThe herbage of the prairie, consisting of strong-rooted grasses, is\r\ndifficult to plough for the first time, and is commonly accomplished\r\nwith the aid of six oxen. The first ploughing is sometimes performed by\r\ncontract at $2 per acre. The plough for breaking up the prairie is\r\nfurnished with a broad share, and cuts a turf seventeen or eighteen\r\ninches broad, by two or three in depth. Indian corn is dropped into\r\nevery third furrow, a bushel being sufficient for ten acres, and covered\r\nwith the next cut turf. This crop receives no farther cultivation of any\r\nkind, is termed sod corn, and said to yield fifty bushels per acre. A\r\nwheat crop follows without a second ploughing, the soil being simply\r\nharrowed, receiving half-a-bushel of seed, and yielding twenty-five\r\nbushels per acre. When Indian corn is grown on land not newly broken up,\r\nit is commonly planted on hills four feet square, and four seeds are\r\nallowed to each hill. The grasses do not appear amongst sod corn, and\r\nannual weeds are not often troublesome, until after four or five years’\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nI witnessed the process of seeding land with wheat, during my visit to\r\nMr Humphries. Four oxen were dragging a small harrow, driven by his son,\r\nwho left them standing while he sowed ridge by ridge, and he was the\r\nonly individual engaged in the operation. The previous crop had been\r\nIndian corn, and the land had not been ploughed since its removal. Dung\r\nis not applied to the fields, though sometimes to the gardens, in which\r\nmelons and potatoes are chiefly cultivated. At Springfield, the potato\r\nof Britain is not of fine quality, and passes by the name of Irish\r\npotato, to distinguish it from the sweet potato, a species of\r\n_convolvolus_. These potatoes seem not to be suited to the same climate.\r\nHere, and farther to the south, the sweet potato was of large size, and\r\nmore palatable than the Irish one, although not equal to this root when\r\ngrown in a colder region. I observed a few plants of Guinea corn, which\r\nits cultivators said answered as a substitute for coffee, but none of\r\nthem seemed to have given it a trial.\r\n\r\nClovers, or any description of herbage plant, did not come under my\r\nnotice. The prairie grasses, when closely depastured for a series of\r\nyears, fall off, and are said ultimately to disappear. This circumstance\r\nwas a source of uneasiness to some settlers, who looked forward to the\r\ntime when there would be a scarcity of food for cattle, and which seemed\r\nto me as irrational as the Canadian farmers’ fears of wanting firewood.\r\n\r\nI did not see breeding-horses or sheep in any part of my journey,\r\nalthough I have no doubt there are plenty of both in the country. The\r\ncattle were not numerous, but of good size, and in tolerable condition.\r\nThe prairie herbage was so completely withered, that I could not form an\r\nopinion of its feeding qualities in spring. What had been burned to\r\nafford a fresh supply, was so closely cropt by the cattle, that its\r\nreproductive properties could not be estimated. In some situations near\r\nSpringfield, where stock is pretty numerous, and the prairie has been\r\ncropt by them for years, the herbage appeared thin and unnutritious.\r\nPigs were frequently seen running about the forest, and were, like all\r\nothers seen at large in course of my tour, perfect starvelings. The\r\nacorn season had arrived, and I was amused at the pigs scrambling for\r\nthis fruit. They ran grunting from tree to tree, and the noise of a\r\nfalling acorn was the prelude to a race and fight.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are thinly scattered over the country, and chiefly\r\nsettled on the skirts of the forest, the middle of prairies being\r\naltogether unoccupied, and I was told untaken-up land, or such as had\r\nnot been bought from government, existed within a mile of Springfield.\r\nProximity to forest is chosen for the facility of obtaining building,\r\nfencing, and fuel timber; and a settler regards the distance of half a\r\nmile from forest an intolerable burden. The dwelling-places are\r\nlog-houses, larger than those of Canada, and somewhat better finished.\r\nFrequently a nail or piece of iron is not used in the whole erection,\r\nthe door is without lock or latch, and the beds in the cock-loft lighted\r\nby chinks in the walls. In such places, the owners of hundreds of acres\r\nand scores of cattle reside. How powerful is habit and fashion in all\r\nthings! Labour is scarce and highly remunerated. A good farming help\r\nobtains $120, and an indifferent one $100 a-year, with bed and board. A\r\nfemale help receives in private families a dollar a-week. The\r\nhotel-keeper at Springfield pays two female helps each $2 weekly in\r\ncash, and told me if it were not for a desire young girls have for fine\r\nclothes, he could not get one on any terms. Board, at the hotel, with\r\nbed, is $3 for short periods, and for long periods $2½ per week.\r\n\r\nIn the Springfield market, butter is worth eight cents per pound, and\r\neggs six cents per dozen. Beef, in small quantities, is worth three, and\r\npork two cents per pound, respectively, and much cheaper by the carcass.\r\nWheat sells for thirty-seven and a-half, oats eighteen, and Indian corn\r\nten cents per bushel. Good muscovado sugar costs ten, and coffee twenty\r\ncents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Springfield to St Louis—Jacksonville—Emigrant from\r\n    Edinburgh—Beds—Face of the Country—Alton—Mississippi—Luxuriant\r\n    vegetation—Bottoms—Mamelle Prairie—Mr Flint—St Charles—River\r\n    Missouri—Notices of Nature—Indian Antiquities—St Louis._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my excursion from Chicago, I was fortunate in weather, which was\r\ndry and moderately warm. The temperature increased on the day of my\r\narrival at Springfield, and became so hot on the following day, that I\r\nresolved to wait for a mail stage to convey me to the Mississippi; I\r\naccordingly left Springfield, about nine o’clock in the morning, in a\r\nsmall stage, which reached Jacksonville about sunset. A very heavy\r\nshower of rain fell soon after setting out, and covered the roads four\r\nor five inches deep with water, the level surface and want of ditches\r\npreventing its escape. The passengers dined by the way, and chiefly\r\nconsisted of clerical students, on their way to Jacksonville college.\r\nFrom their conversation with each other, I learned they had lately been\r\nengaged in teaching in different parts of the country, and felt much\r\nanxiety about speeches they were soon to make, and which were already\r\nwritten, and had been revised by friends. They were plain in dress and\r\nin manner, bordering on what is called homespun in Britain; and they\r\nsung most beautifully while in the coach.\r\n\r\nJacksonville contains about the same number of souls as Springfield, but\r\nis superior in buildings, arrangement, and situation. Many of the houses\r\nconsist of brick, and the hotels are large and commodious. The country\r\nin the neighbourhood is considered populous in this part of the world,\r\nand has been settled for a considerable length of time. I was anxious to\r\nsee the farm of some Englishmen, whose skill I had heard extolled, but\r\nwant of time and light denied me this gratification.\r\n\r\nI had been intrusted with a letter to a gentleman in the vicinity of\r\nJacksonville, who formerly resided near Edinburgh, and which I would\r\nhave delivered personally, had I not been informed, when approaching\r\nSpringfield, that he had lately moved from his first situation into the\r\nterritory of Arkansas. On this intelligence, I put the letter into the\r\npost-office, and a few minutes afterwards learned, from unquestionable\r\nauthority, that my first intelligence was incorrect. Finding the stage\r\ndid not leave Jacksonville until two o’clock in the morning, I resolved\r\nto visit the gentleman, who resided about three miles from the village.\r\nThe moon being nearly full, I had little difficulty in reaching his\r\ndwelling. It was late before Mr L—— made his appearance, who happened to\r\nbe dining with Mr K——, but the interim passed pleasantly in the company\r\nof Mrs L——, whom I had seen in East Lothian, and a sensible Irishman,\r\nwho had settled himself about a hundred miles higher up the Mississippi.\r\nThe house was a log erection of two apartments, and the family seemed to\r\npossess every necessary of life. Want of light prevented me seeing the\r\nfarm, and forming an opinion of the prospects and circumstances of this\r\nemigrant.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Jacksonville, I found some of the stage-passengers\r\npartaking of coffee before setting out on the journey. The vehicle was\r\nwell filled, and contained a young married woman labouring under ague.\r\nSome of the passengers were agreeable and communicative. We passed\r\nthrough Carlton, dined at a solitary log-house, and reached Alton\r\nsometime after nightfall. The hotel being crowded, there was difficulty\r\nin accommodating the passengers, and I was asked to take half a bed. I\r\nassented to this arrangement, but added I was a foreigner, and not\r\nlikely to make the most agreeable companion to a native, on which\r\naccount I would feel obliged to have, were it possible, a bed for\r\nmyself; the landlord indulged me. By following this policy, I invariably\r\nobtained a whole bed in hotels, and it was only in the huts of the\r\nremote parts of the country, where beds could not be obtained, that I\r\ndid not sleep alone.\r\n\r\nThe misrepresentations of American character, in connexion with beds,\r\nare frequently met with in Britain, and of which the following anecdote,\r\nrelated by one of my friends, may serve as an illustration. Two\r\nEnglishmen, travelling in a hired carriage, reached a lonely inn at a\r\nlate hour, to which they got admittance, and, after much solicitation,\r\nat length each took possession of a bed. In a short time afterwards, the\r\ndriver wished to share one of the beds; an altercation ensued with the\r\nfirst possessor, who reluctantly yielded, in preference to maintaining\r\nhis position by animal strength. However much the brutality of the\r\ndriver may appear to be set forth in this anecdote, the traveller was\r\nthe more culpable of the two. In such a climate as that of the United\r\nStates, where people can move from place to place in carriages of any\r\ndescription, every body will prefer the whole of a bed to a part, and\r\nthe circumstance of the driver wishing to lie down beside the\r\nEnglishman, is evidence that a third bed could not be obtained. In all\r\nprobability, the customs of the district and sentiments of the driver,\r\nplaced both individuals on a footing of equality, and it was\r\nunreasonable to attempt to exclude him from a share of comfort, and more\r\nespecially if the family put themselves to inconvenience in furnishing\r\nthe beds. If the Englishman disliked nestling with the driver, he might\r\nhave crept in beside his friend, or quietly betaken himself to the\r\nfloor. I remember arriving at a large and well-conducted inn at Melrose,\r\nScotland, on the evening preceding an annual lamb market, and learned\r\nthat on such occasions travellers could only have half a bed. In course\r\nof the evening, the waiter whispered that my companion wished to retire\r\nfor the night, and pointed him out on the opposite side of the table. He\r\nwas a profligate and well-known character, and nearly intoxicated to\r\ninsensibility. To have shared his bed was an idea revolting to my\r\nfeelings, and, after requesting that he might be shown to a room, I\r\nstretched myself on chairs for the night.\r\n\r\nThe two foreign gentlemen, in whose company I travelled from Detroit to\r\nChicago, carried along with them a bed tick of air-tight cloth, which\r\nwas occasionally filled, and reposed on by one of them. This is a very\r\nportable bed, and will be found agreeable to travellers frequenting the\r\nwilds of America, who do not dislike being encumbered with luggage. A\r\nrobust person who dreads such accommodation as the country affords, will\r\ndo very well with the aid of a cloak to wrap himself in during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe country from Springfield to Alton, by way of Jacksonville, is a\r\nsuccession of prairies of a different character from those formerly\r\nseen, their surface being almost perfectly level, and in many parts\r\nindicating wetness. The soil did not always appear rich, more especially\r\ntowards the conclusion of the journey. Darkness prevented me seeing much\r\nof the country around Jacksonville, but I saw a small patch of clover,\r\nwhich was the only instance I observed this plant in Michigan, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, and Missouri.\r\n\r\nAlton stands on the east bank of the Mississippi, about one mile above\r\nthe junction of the Missouri, and sixteen below that of the Illinois. It\r\nconsists of two irregular villages, called Upper and Lower Alton; the\r\npopulation is stated at about 700 souls. This place is likely to become\r\nthe chief port of Illinois on the Mississippi, and is already the seat\r\nof considerable trade.\r\n\r\nOn leaving my bedroom, on the morning after arriving at Alton, the\r\nMississippi was seen flowing before me at a few yards’ distance, and my\r\nfirst proceeding was to fetch part of its water in a jug for morning\r\nablution, the number of travellers in the house rendering some exertion\r\nnecessary to get washed and shaved in time for breakfast. On leaving the\r\nhotel, I walked down to the junction of the Missouri, and returned to\r\nAlton, where I crossed the Mississippi in a horse ferry-boat. The stream\r\nis more than a mile in breadth, flows at the rate of one or two miles an\r\nhour, and is slightly turbid. The situation of Alton, from the opposite\r\nside of the ferry, is beautiful. An island divides the river, which,\r\nbeing land-locked above and below, has the appearance of a lake. The\r\nwestern bank is low, the eastern high and rocky, terminated by wood on\r\nthe summits of the bluffs, as the projecting knolls or hills on the\r\nbanks of some American rivers are called. The rocks are partly sand and\r\npartly limestone.\r\n\r\nHere I observed a steam grist-mill; the under part of the building was\r\ncomposed of stone, as high as the water of the river would reach in\r\nfloods, the upper part being of wood. The building was founded on rock,\r\nand stones might have been had for the upper stories, by laying a plank\r\nfrom the building to the rock on the rising bank.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of my present excursion was to view the prairie in the\r\nneighbourhood of St Charles, at the foot of the Mamelles, so beautifully\r\ndescribed by Mr Flint, whose account is given as a quotation in Mr\r\nStuart’s “Three Years’ Residence in America.” The description excited my\r\nimagination at the time of first reading it, and was imprinted on my\r\nmemory till effaced by seeing the object before me. St Charles is about\r\ntwenty-six miles from Alton, and as there was no regular conveyance\r\nbetween the places, I did not regret the necessity of walking, which\r\nwould afford me an opportunity of traversing the narrow neck of land,\r\nseparating two of the largest rivers before their junction in the most\r\nfertile and extensive valley on earth, as well as of examining the\r\nmodern paradise of my imagination.\r\n\r\nThe road from Alton to St Charles passes up the west bank of the\r\nMississippi for above a mile, and for ten or twelve through its densely\r\nwooded bottoms, at no great distance from the river before the prairie\r\nis reached. On attaining the opposite side of the ferry, the exuberant\r\nand varied vegetation excited my admiration, and far surpassed every\r\nthing I had seen on the banks of the Illinois and its tributaries. The\r\nheight and circumference of the trees are immense, and such was the\r\nrankness of vegetation, that I culled several leaves from young shoots\r\nof the button-wood two feet in length. The climbing plants were in\r\nproportion to the rest of the vegetable family, reaching the summits of\r\nthe most gigantic trees; sometimes three species were clinging to the\r\nsame trunk, and seemed vying with each other in richness and beauty. The\r\nvines particularly attracted my notice. This plant is common in most\r\nparts of North America, and its foliage is beautiful in the\r\nneighbourhood of Montreal. Here the stem of the vine was occasionally\r\nseen nearly a foot in diameter, issuing from the earth twenty or thirty\r\nfeet from the root of the tree which supported its branches, and\r\nstretching seventy or eighty feet before coming in contact with the\r\ntrunk, forming, together with its supporter, a striking representation\r\nof a massy flag-staff. I had difficulty in accounting for the form which\r\nthe vine presented. Both plants may be considered coeval, and their\r\nboughs to have extended in unison. Some tender twigs of a vine were\r\nobserved climbing and twining around its aged stems, leading to the\r\nsupporting tree, which seemed to me illustrative of maternal affection,\r\nand of the hackneyed phrase, “teaching the young idea how to shoot.”\r\nThere were some trees of diminutive growth overhanging the river, from\r\nthe tops of which the tendrils of the vine hung in graceful festoons, as\r\nif wooing the water. From such I collected fruit, and discriminated\r\nseveral varieties by the form and flavour of the grape.\r\n\r\nAt first the clear and wide-spreading prairies delighted me from their\r\nnovelty, and the contrast with the dense and interminable forests of\r\nUpper Canada, and I now enjoyed the umbrageous vegetation of the\r\nMississippi bottom, after having become familiar with the nakedness of\r\nthe prairie. All the rivers of magnitude in the valley of the\r\nMississippi seem to have occupied, at a remote period, higher elevations\r\nand wider channels than they now do, called first and second banks, and\r\nthe flat space on the margins of their present channels passes by the\r\nname of bottom, which generally consists of alluvial depositions,\r\nannually augmented by the overflowing of the waters at the melting of\r\nthe snow. This bottom of the Mississippi was undescribably rich, and I\r\nwas so engrossed by the wonders of its shadowy vegetation, as to be\r\ninsensible of the approach of rain and thunder, until torrents fell\r\naround me. Shelter was obtained from the inclining trunk of a large\r\ntree, and the foliage of many of the climbing plants formed vegetable\r\numbrellas.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the bottom is of considerable tenacity, and the rain\r\nrendered it unpleasant and fatiguing to walk on. The road diverged from\r\nthe river at an uninhabited brick house, and I did not see a human being\r\nfor eight or ten miles. Some of the houses seemed to have been deserted,\r\nand no recent settlement made. In one situation there was a large and\r\nwell-grown orchard, from which I gathered most excellent apples. There\r\nwere few traces of cultivation, and Indian corn was the only\r\nagricultural production on the soil. Weeds, which in other situations\r\nwere observed of diminutive size, here attained magnitude, and I\r\nestimated the height of some Indian corn at twenty feet; amongst this\r\ncrop purple coloured convolvuluses were twining, the seeds of which were\r\nadded to my collection. On examining some wheat ricks, I found the straw\r\ncovered with mildew, and the grain shrivelled skins. Fertile as the\r\nMississippi bottom appeared, it bore no traces of human enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOn entering the prairie, which is elevated a little above the bottom\r\nland, two lines of road diverge, and I was directed on that leading to\r\nSt Charles, by two men of colour chopping firewood in front of a house,\r\nwho, in all probability, were the first slaves I had ever seen, Missouri\r\nbeing a state in which slavery is tolerated, and in which I had\r\ntravelled since crossing the Mississippi. My way, for a considerable\r\ndistance, was over a waxy soil covered with water, the road being\r\nbounded with tall grass, over which I could not see. On attaining a\r\nhigher elevation, the rank grass disappeared, the soil became dry, and\r\nfor miles was of poorer quality than any I had seen since leaving the\r\nshores of Lake Michigan. The soil, which was worn into inequalities by\r\nthe action of wind and travellers, was repeatedly examined, and the\r\nopinion which I formed was corroborated by the thriftless and stunted\r\nvegetation on its surface. On leaving the bottom there were some spots\r\ncovered with clover, and the finer descriptions of grass, closely\r\ncropped by cattle, which formed the only verdant pasturage I had met\r\nwith since leaving Amherstburgh in Canada. My progress over the wet\r\nroads had been slow, and I felt fatigued and hungry. On applying for\r\nbread at a log-house, the inmates cheerfully offered to prepare some for\r\nme, but I departed after quaffing a glass of water. The soil improved,\r\nwithout becoming very rich. Some people were engaged in sowing wheat,\r\nand several herds of cattle were observed. On the left-hand side of the\r\nroad there was a narrow and extensive sheet of water, covered with weeds\r\nand waterfowl, and seemingly connected with the Missouri. Light\r\ndisappeared before I reached St Charles, and several miles were\r\ntraversed in darkness.\r\n\r\nI did ample justice to the viands set before me at St Charles, sitting\r\nat table with the landlord and his wife, and tended by a female slave,\r\nwho was addressed by all in terms of civility. The landlord was a\r\nVirginian, and had lately commenced hotel-keeping at St Charles, in\r\nconsequence of having been unfortunate in another calling in the place\r\nof his birth. I found him kind and gentlemanly in manner, and\r\ncommunicative and intelligent on a variety of subjects. He presented me\r\nwith a glass of wine, as made from the grape of the country, and which I\r\nconsidered good.\r\n\r\nIn course of conversation I learned the landlord intended going to St\r\nLouis next day, immediately after breakfast, and he agreed to give me a\r\nseat in his waggon on the same terms as the regular conveyances carried\r\npassengers. Before going to bed, it was arranged that I should visit the\r\nMamelles in the morning, and at daybreak I found a horse waiting for me,\r\nwhich proceeded over the ground at a rapid pace. The road leading from\r\nSt Charles to the prairie passes through a rich and beautiful country,\r\nsomething like a narrow valley, with swelling heights to the west, the\r\nopposite side forming good farms. I followed a diverging pathway leading\r\nup the ascent, and soon found myself on the brow of an eminence,\r\ncommanding an extensive view of the prairie, over which I had travelled\r\nthe preceding evening. The scene was so different from the conceptions I\r\nhad formed of it, that I fancied myself occupying a wrong position, and\r\nseeing a cottage on the plain below, I descended to ascertain the point.\r\nOn asking for the Mamelles, a person pointed to a bluff a few hundred\r\nyards distant, forming the termination of the ridge I had just left, and\r\nconsiderably more to the east than the spot where I had been. Leaving my\r\nhorse attached to a railing in front of the cottage, into which I was\r\ninvited, I ascended the Mamelle on foot, from the top of which the scene\r\nwas unvaried from that I had seen before, with exception of the addition\r\nof part of the small valley running towards St Charles, and which seemed\r\nthe most interesting part of the landscape. Strong indications exist of\r\nthe Missouri and Mississippi having once united their waters at this\r\nspot; and if such was the case, the prairie must then have formed the\r\nbottom of a lake, and become dry when the rivers assumed a lower level.\r\nThe prairie is bounded to the west by the ridge of bluffs, of which the\r\nMamelles form a part; and to the east by the forest on the Missouri and\r\nMississippi bottoms. On the north the Mississippi curves gracefully\r\nround the margin, and its bold eastern bank forms a beautiful outline.\r\nThe centre is monotonously flat; and at no great distance from where I\r\nstood were two insignificant clumps of stunted trees, which afforded no\r\nrelief to the eye, and excited ideas of sterility. Excluding the pretty\r\nvalley stretching towards St Charles, and which cannot with propriety be\r\nconsidered as forming part of the prairie, half-a-dozen of hamlets could\r\nnot be numbered, and there was a total absence of animated life. The\r\nrich blossoms of the various plants which impart delight to a lover of\r\nnature, had yielded to the influence of the season, and autumn had\r\nseared vegetation. The long narrow stripe of stagnant water which I had\r\nskirted the night before was a conspicuous feature, and suggested ague\r\nand pestilence. The view from the Mamelle was found to be extensive, but\r\nnot pleasing; and, hurrying from my elevated position, I scampered off\r\nfor St Charles.\r\n\r\nMr Flint, in speaking of this prairie, says, “It yields generally forty\r\nbushels of wheat, and seventy of corn, to the acre. _The vegetable soil\r\nhas a depth of forty feet, and earth thrown from the bottom of the wells\r\nis as fertile as that on the surface. Here are 100,000 acres of land of\r\nthis description fit for the plough._”\r\n\r\nI am of opinion there is not a square inch of such soil as Mr Flint\r\ndescribes. But in differing with him on the merits of this prairie, I\r\nmust not forget that the impressions of a scene are always affected by\r\nthe circumstances under which it is viewed, both with regard to nature\r\nand the individual himself. The weather was unfavourable at the time of\r\nmy visit, which was on the 1st of October. Thick clouds obscured the\r\nsky, and were scudding before a cold and tempestuous west wind. The\r\nground was drenched by rain which had fallen in course of the evening,\r\nand strewed with leaves and branches torn from the trees by the violence\r\nof the storm. Personal circumstances were more favourable than those of\r\nthe weather for forming a just estimate. Having already traversed part\r\nof Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, the novelty and excitement at my\r\nfirst introduction to prairie scenery had subsided. I enjoyed the\r\nhighest degree of mental and bodily vigour, was at peace with the world,\r\nand favourably predisposed towards the object. Mr Flint was differently\r\nsituated. But perhaps an American poet and a Scottish clodpole will ever\r\nview things through a different medium. The means which I had of forming\r\nan estimate of this prairie were ample, and the simple fact of it being\r\nstill almost uninhabited, while thousands of settlers have passed over\r\nit to more distant locations, may be taken as proof that my estimate is\r\nsubstantially just. Having spoken of Mr Flint as a poet, it is but\r\njustice for me to say I have alone formed my opinion of his endowments\r\nfrom the account he has given of this prairie, which seems to have been\r\nwritten with poetic license. “The prairie itself,” he says, “was a most\r\nglorious spectacle,—such a sea of verdure, in one direction, extending\r\nbeyond the reach of the eye, and presenting millions of flowers of every\r\nscent and hue, seemed an immense flower-garden.” This is a description\r\nof a prairie, in lat. 39, in the month of September, when the luxuriance\r\nand brilliancy of vegetation is past. But it was “the first prairie of\r\nany great size or beauty” he had seen. To me, who had already become\r\nacquainted with the fertility of such places, and formed opinions of\r\ntheir utility in relation to civilized man, the scene was associated\r\nwith the disease and destruction of the human race, and not their\r\nenjoyment and support.\r\n\r\nHad the season of the year and state of the weather been more favourable\r\nfor viewing this prairie, I might have admired its beautiful outlines;\r\nbut under no circumstances would it have possessed the interest of the\r\nlandscape seen from the heights above Ottawa on the river Illinois. Here\r\nextensive prairies are seen stretching on every hand, with beautiful\r\nundulating surfaces, and adorned with masses of forest of every shape\r\nand size. The junction of the Fox River with the Illinois is in the\r\nforeground, and their banks are either forest or prairie, in keeping\r\nwith the surrounding surface. Both rivers are of moderate size, and the\r\nflowing of their limpid waters imparts life to the landscape, which\r\ncombines all the soft beauties of prairie scenery, and excites\r\nassociations connected with human happiness. Settlers are yearly taking\r\nup their residence in this quarter, and the junction of the Illinois\r\nwith Lake Michigan, by means of a railway or canal, which the state has\r\nundertaken to construct, will insure its early settlement.\r\n\r\nSt Charles is one of the many places in the Western States, founded by\r\nthe French, which they partially explored in the early part of the\r\neighteenth century; and the descendants of the first settlers are still\r\nmet with throughout the course of the St Lawrence and the valley of the\r\nMississippi, possessing the language, manners, and customs of their\r\nforefathers. The population is stated to be above 1200, and to consist\r\nof nearly equal numbers of Americans and descendants of the French. It\r\nis washed by the Missouri, and has increased considerably in wealth and\r\npopulation of late years.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast the landlord of the hotel, whose name has\r\nescaped my memory, conducted me over the rocky banks of the river to the\r\nhorse ferry-boat, on board of which was his waggon and handsome pair of\r\nhorses. The boat proceeded up the north bank for nearly a mile before\r\ncrossing the stream, and the horses by which it was propelled were\r\nconsiderably distressed, and generally blind and in low condition. The\r\nMissouri possesses a different character from any river I had seen\r\nbefore. Here its breadth is about half a mile, the waters running\r\nimpetuously between wooded banks, and so turbid as to exceed in\r\nmuddiness the water of British streams after the most copious rains. The\r\nislands and banks seem to be constantly changing, and strewed with\r\nfallen trees, having their tops in the stream, and their roots on land.\r\nThe water of the Missouri is said to undergo little change in\r\nconsistency or colour, which is whitish, except during severe frost,\r\nwhen it contains less mud. The state of the waters of the Missouri is\r\nthought to be owing to the washing away of the banks, and it is\r\ndifficult to account for it on other grounds. The course of the river\r\nbefore reaching St Charles is not much short of 3000 miles, and I have\r\nnot been able to learn the state of the waters towards its source, or\r\nthat of its tributaries at the places of junction.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the opposite side of the Missouri, we travelled over two\r\nmiles of bottom resembling that of the Mississippi opposite to Alton,\r\nbut not quite equalling it in vegetable luxuriance. The surface was wet\r\nfrom the rain that had fallen, and the only inhabitant seen was so\r\nfeeble and emaciated, that his life was likely to be of short duration.\r\nOn passing the bottom, we had about twelve miles of highly-undulating\r\nsurface, consisting of red-coloured clay, of fertile quality, thinly\r\nwooded, and partially settled. For nearly six miles, before reaching St\r\nLouis, the road passes through a prairie country of undulating red clay,\r\nand apparently speedily getting into forest. The landlord told me he had\r\nvisited this district many years before, which was then without a tree.\r\nThere is a race-course within three miles of St Louis, which appears\r\nwell frequented.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto observed the vine growing chiefly by the sides of lakes\r\nand rivers, but here it was growing on the highest and most elevated\r\nsituations, loaded with fruit. The prevailing tree on the partially\r\nwooded part of the road was oak. I first observed the catalpa-tree in\r\nthe streets of St Charles, and the persimon, in travelling to St Louis.\r\nThis fruit was disagreeable to my palate, and did not improve on a\r\nsecond trial some days afterwards.\r\n\r\nThroughout my tour in the States of New England and Upper Canada, I had\r\nfound the soil of all districts where the surface was considerably\r\nundulating, uniformly of inferior quality. Michigan presented the same\r\nappearance, and on a few of the prairies I fancied I could trace the\r\nsame feature. I had considered the subject on different occasions, and\r\nbegan to draw a general conclusion, which this day’s experience\r\ncompletely upset. Here the surface was one of the most undulating I had\r\ntravelled over, and uniformly of fertile clay. I afterwards found some\r\nof the swelling grounds of Ohio of this character.\r\n\r\nWe met and conversed with the members of several families moving into\r\nMissouri, with the view of settling in the remote parts of the state;\r\nand I met one before crossing the Mississippi, on his return from it, in\r\nconsequence, he said, of its unhealthiness. Local attachments seem to be\r\nthe sheetanchor of man, and when they are once broken, or exist weakly,\r\nhe becomes restless, and unhesitatingly follows any ignis fatuus that\r\nmay dance before his imagination. From this source the erratic habits of\r\nthe American population may perhaps arise, as well as many of their\r\npeculiarities of manners and customs. But without pursuing this subject\r\ninto its various ramifications, I may remark that the temporary houses,\r\nfences, and generally uncomfortable nature of a Western American\r\nfarmer’s establishment, may be the result of constantly looking forward\r\nto departing from his residence, and seeking to have little property but\r\nwhat can be easily transported.\r\n\r\nOn reaching St Louis, I found the hotels crowded; my first two\r\napplications for accommodation being unsuccessful, I at last gained\r\nadmittance into a secondary hotel, to which I was recommended by the\r\nlandlord from St Charles. I slept in an apartment containing two beds,\r\nwhich were occupied, and the arrangements and customs of the hotel were\r\nsimilar to those I had hitherto frequented. Two days were spent in St\r\nLouis and its neighbourhood, on both of which I examined some mounds, or\r\ntumuli, of a former race of people, some of which are on the north\r\nskirts of St Louis, and many more on the opposite side of the river.\r\n\r\nThese mounds are found over the whole of the valley of the Mississippi,\r\nand many conjectures exist regarding their origin. They are found of all\r\nsizes and shapes, from the finished pyramid to the perpendicular square,\r\na few feet in height. Soon after my arrival at St Louis, I found one in\r\nthe town, of an oblong shape, fifty yards in length, and finished with a\r\nregular pitch of about forty feet in perpendicular height, while\r\nanother, at a short distance, with sloping sides, had an unfinished top\r\nthirty-four by forty-four yards. Some tumuli have been examined, and\r\nfound to contain immense quantities of human bones and broken pottery,\r\nwhich has given rise to a general opinion that they were the\r\nburying-places of former ages. Besides tumuli there are other\r\nantiquities of forts, camps, or towns, the best specimens of which are\r\nin Ohio; and a fort in the neighbourhood of Newark, in that state,\r\ncontains forty acres within its walls, which are about ten feet high.\r\nThe Indians of the present day in the northern and middle parts of the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi, are neither sufficiently numerous nor skilful\r\nto erect such works, from which some people argue the antiquities\r\nbelonged to a different race, which preceded the Indians. It is of no\r\nconsequence to the existing portion of the human race by what beings\r\nthese remains were erected; and the grounds for believing the Indians to\r\nhave decreased in numbers, and retrograded in civilisation, are much\r\nstronger than those for conjecturing them to have been preceded by a\r\ndistinct and more skilful people.\r\n\r\nSt Louis stands on the west bank of the Mississippi, 1200 miles above\r\nits junction with the sea, 200 above the confluence of the river Ohio,\r\nand 18 miles below that of the Missouri. Its situation is sufficiently\r\nelevated above the river, the banks of which are limestone. There is a\r\nrow of stores fronting the river, built of stone, and the town consists\r\nchiefly of two streets of brick-houses, running parallel to the river,\r\nthe outskirts being mean wooden houses. This is a place of extensive\r\ntrade, being the chief depôt of lead, which is furnished in vast\r\nquantities by the states of Illinois and Missouri. Grist-mills and other\r\nmachinery are propelled by steam. I counted sixteen steam-boats on the\r\nriver, exclusive of one plying as a ferry-boat.\r\n\r\nThe city was founded by the French in 1764, and about one-third of the\r\ninhabitants are their descendants. The American population now\r\npreponderates, but there are numbers of all nations, including many\r\nSpaniards. It is the chief place of wealth and trade on the Mississippi,\r\nwith exception of New Orleans, and may justly be considered the\r\nmetropolis of the valley of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nI visited the market night and morning, which was abundantly supplied\r\nwith every necessary, brought forward by farmers from all parts of the\r\ncountry, and not retailed by stall-keepers. Many well-dressed white\r\nladies, and blacks of both sexes, carried baskets over their arms, and\r\nwere making purchases, but I did not observe a white gentleman. Here I\r\nfirst saw the egg-plant. For hen eggs 9½d. a-dozen, and for skinned\r\nsquirrels 1½d. each, sterling money, was asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n  _Voyage from St Louis to Cincinnati—Mississippi—Ohio—Falls\r\n    of the Ohio—Passengers—Details of the Voyage—Notices\r\n    in Natural History—Vessels on the\r\n    River—Louisville—Hotel—Steam-boats—Inquisitive\r\n    Irishman—Tobacco-squirting American—Advantages of Shabby Attire to\r\n    Travellers—Mr Hamilton’s Account of Men and Manners in the Western\r\n    Steam-boats—Cincinnati—Agricultural Notices._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made up my mind to pay a second visit to Upper Canada before\r\nreturning to Britain, and wishing to take Cincinnati in my way, I\r\nhesitated whether to proceed by stages, through Illinois and Indiana to\r\nLouisville, or by a steam-boat down the Mississippi, and up the Ohio.\r\nHaving more than once experienced the deceitfulness of information\r\nobtained from stage-office people in Britain, and disliking the\r\ninformation got at the offices of St Louis, I determined on travelling\r\nby water, and, learning the Helen Mar was to sail in a few hours\r\nafterwards, I immediately secured a berth.\r\n\r\nThe Helen Mar was a boat of the smallest size, and on this account well\r\nsuited for the voyage at this season of the year, when there is a want\r\nof water in the Ohio for vessels of the second class. She proceeded at a\r\nrapid rate down the current, and made the first stop at Jefferson\r\nBarracks, ten miles below St Louis, on the west side of the river, where\r\nwe were detained until nightfall, by receiving on board some officers of\r\nthe United States army, with their families and luggage. In course of\r\nthe night, one of the shafts broke, and the vessel continued her voyage\r\nwith one paddle.\r\n\r\nI found the Mississippi a very different looking stream from what it was\r\nat Alton. Instead of being a placid river, gliding gently between\r\nbeautiful banks, it had assumed the character of the Missouri,\r\nimpetuosity, muddiness, and devastated margins. In sailing down the\r\nMississippi below St Louis, we were said to have passed the most\r\ninteresting scenery in the night, and there was little seen by me\r\ncalculated to impart pleasure or relieve the eye. The dense, and at this\r\nseason, gloomy vegetation on the banks and islands, reminded me of the\r\nLake of the Thousand Isles, at the opening of the St Lawrence. The\r\nturbid torrent, boiling and whirling in a thousand directions, was\r\nwashing away the banks at one place, and leaving depositions at another.\r\nIndian corn was seen falling with masses of earth, and mingling with the\r\nstream, and uprooted trees, suspended from the banks with their branches\r\nunder water, as if experiencing suffocation. Everything suggested to the\r\nmind desolation, and led me to think this such a river as despairing man\r\nmight choose for his last plunge. The whole day was spent on deck, and I\r\nfelt my spirits sinking when we approached the mouth of the Ohio, which\r\nforms a striking contrast to the Mississippi. The Ohio at its junction\r\nwith the Mississippi, called by the Indians “the Father of Waters,” is\r\nbroader than the parent stream, and after the junction of three such\r\nrivers as the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio, their mingled streams do\r\nnot appear larger to the eye than any of them singly, which arises from\r\nthe depth and rapidity of the united current. The same difference of\r\ncolour in the waters which I had remarked at the confluence of the\r\nOttawa and St Lawrence, and of Missouri and Mississippi, were here\r\nperceptible. The limpid and placid Ohio, dammed up by the larger stream,\r\nand resting without motion between smooth and verdant banks, resembled\r\nthe stillness of sleep. The Mississippi was like maddened intoxication.\r\nWell might the French of old, after traversing the death-like\r\nMississippi, and becoming acquainted with the Ohio, term it _La Belle\r\nRivière_, the beautiful river, a title it justly merits. For some time\r\nthe winding course and full stream reminded me of sailing on a lake, yet\r\nthe banks are monotonous, being thinly settled, with the background hid\r\nfrom view, and but for the lovely tints which autumn had imparted to the\r\nfoliage, would have been without much interest. On advancing up the\r\nOhio, the channel became bound by sand plains, which are covered when\r\nthe water is high, and many of the banks of the numerous islands showed,\r\nby the size of the trees, the successive depositions that are made to\r\nthem, and I was enabled to count six rows of the same species rising in\r\ndifferent gradations.\r\n\r\nWe at last reached what are termed the Falls of the Ohio, a name given\r\nto a succession of rapids, caused by a stratum of rocks crossing the\r\nchannel of the river, and form the only obstruction to navigation in the\r\nwhole course of the Ohio. The falls are about two miles in length, and\r\nthe descent in that distance twenty-four feet. When the river is high,\r\nvessels pass up and down the falls, and when low, through a canal lately\r\nopened on the south side of the river, commencing a little below\r\nLouisville, and extending nearly two miles. The Helen Mar had some\r\ndifficulty in getting over a bar and rapid below the entrance to the\r\ncanal; on reaching which I walked forward to Louisville, over a verdant\r\nsmooth turf, which I enjoyed greatly, after so long an absence from\r\nnature’s best carpeting.\r\n\r\nThe water in the Ohio was still low, although our captain had often been\r\ntold on the voyage the river had risen eighteen inches in course of a\r\nfew days. The rising of the Ohio and most of the western rivers in\r\nautumn is observed to take place annually, without a considerable fall\r\nof rain occurring in the lower part of their courses. This is generally\r\naccounted for by the diminished temperature of the atmosphere lessening\r\nevaporation on the earth’s surface. In all probability it is more owing\r\nto suspended vegetation, the falling leaves and decaying herbage ceasing\r\nto throw off moisture.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our voyage from St Louis to Louisville, a distance of\r\nsix hundred and thirty miles, passengers were received and landed at\r\nmany intermediate places, but the majority of them continued the whole\r\ndistance. My time being spent chiefly in viewing the different objects\r\non the rivers and their banks, I did not become intimate with any\r\nindividual, except one, Mr Gemble, with whom I afterwards travelled by\r\nstage to Columbus in Ohio, and met at the Washington Hotel, on my return\r\nto New York. In course of conversation I learned he resided at St Louis,\r\nhad travelled in the Rocky Mountains, and was on his way to the eastern\r\nshore to visit an aged parent. We spent a considerable part of fourteen\r\ndays in close conversation, without making the slightest enquiry into\r\neach other’s birth, parentage, or past and present pursuits in life. On\r\nleaving St Louis, I observed him reading several books which he took\r\nfrom his portmanteau, and left exposed on his berth, as if to court\r\nothers to read them. My only companion of this kind at the time was a\r\nsmall volume, entitled, “a View of the Valley of the Mississippi,” which\r\nI often referred to, and found useful, and which Mr Gemble asked me to\r\nallow him to look at, although travellers in American steam-boats\r\ngenerally seize on every book within reach, without obtaining the\r\nconsent of the owner to peruse it. I had thus an opportunity of asking a\r\nreturn of the civility of Mr Gemble, which he readily granted, adding,\r\n“I would be happy to allow every person on board to read my volumes.”\r\nThe first that I opened was one of small dimensions, entitled, “_The\r\nTimes of Christ_,” which the preface stated to be from the pen of the\r\ngifted Harriet Martineau, which appeared in England as the “Traditions\r\nof Palestine,” and had been reprinted with a more suitable title, and\r\nthe omission of some matter which the publisher did not consider in good\r\ntaste with the rest of the work. The other volumes were of a religious\r\nnature, which might have led me to suppose Mr Gemble a spiritual\r\nteacher; but there was nothing in his conversation or deportment marking\r\nor violating this character. He was a tall, thin gentlemanly-looking\r\nperson, well informed, and apparently possessing as much real\r\nphilanthropy as any individual I ever met.\r\n\r\nThe other passengers consisted of both sexes, of all ages, and of\r\ndifferent professions. The ladies were never seen but at meals, keeping\r\ntheir own cabin at other times. The gentlemen were well dressed, and\r\ninvariably civil to each other, General A—— being the least polished in\r\nmanners and appearance of any of the company. The captain was an\r\nunassuming person, whose voice was seldom heard, and never in connexion\r\nwith an oath, either in the cabin or amongst the crew. There was only\r\none cabin passenger addicted to swearing, who had formerly been captain\r\nof a steam-boat on the Mississippi, and was now engaged in trade at St\r\nLouis. The officers of the army, and one or two others, passed part of\r\nthe evenings in playing cards, at a game which I did not understand, and\r\nat which they did not seem to hazard high stakes. On such occasions, I\r\nwas sometimes amused at the group assembled around the table. Military\r\nmen of the highest rank, when eagerly intent on the game, were joined by\r\nthe steward boys without their coats, familiarly seating themselves at\r\ntable, and looking on the hands of cards. The chewing and spitting of\r\ntobacco were incessant, the carpet serving as a receptacle for the\r\nmoisture, when boxes were not within immediate reach; and on some cold\r\nevenings the fire in the cabin was almost overcome by squirting of\r\ntobacco juice.\r\n\r\nThe comfort of the passengers was little attended to in the general\r\narrangements of the vessel. Three times a-day, at breakfast, dinner, and\r\nsupper, which also includes the repast known in the Eastern States, and\r\nin Britain, by the name of tea, the table was stored with supplies of\r\nanimal food and vegetables, so very ample, that on one occasion I\r\nnumbered thirty-one dishes placed on the supper-table for twenty-two\r\npassengers, and, perhaps, in no instance was there ever less than one\r\ndish for each individual. The food was coarsely prepared, and all placed\r\non the table at once, and nearly cold before the company sat down. There\r\nwas always a second company, consisting of part of the boat’s\r\nestablishment, and such deck passengers as chose to pay for their food;\r\nand sometimes a third company collected, independent of the people of\r\ncolour, servants or slaves to the passengers, and who satisfied their\r\nhunger on the veranda. The succession of companies received no additions\r\nto the fare originally placed on the table, and such an injudicious\r\narrangement was the means of rendering it less palatable to all. The\r\nvessel called three or four times a-day at different places, yet, on one\r\noccasion, bread could not be had for breakfast, and milk or cream were\r\nmore than once awanting without any notice being taken of it at table.\r\nThere was no water for drinking or washing but what the rivers supplied,\r\nand this was even the case on the turbid Mississippi, the water of which\r\nwas allowed to separate from the sediment before being presented at\r\ntable. The inhabitants of the Western States are considered by those of\r\nthe Eastern ones as wanting in refinement, and the table being loaded\r\nwith the substantialities of life, while good water and milk, two of the\r\nmost desirable of liquids, and which might at all times have been\r\nobtained on shore, were awanting, appeared a strong indication of\r\ncoarseness. The passengers drank in the greatest moderation in my sight,\r\nonly taking a tumbler of spirits and water occasionally when playing at\r\ncards, and never tasting wine or any kind of spirits at table at other\r\ntimes. I did not observe a person of any description on board, during\r\nthe voyage, that appeared in the least degree intoxicated. The water for\r\nwashing was always fresh drawn from the river, and I thought the\r\nMississippi more likely to stain than clean any face. Many of the\r\ngentlemen attempted to clean their teeth and mouths with such mud, which\r\nI did not pass within my lips. My dressing-case did not contain soap,\r\nwhich I thought an article likely to be had everywhere, but on\r\napplication to the steward, I was told there was none on board. An\r\napplication to the captain, or some of the passengers, would have\r\nprocured me this commodity, at least for shaving with, but there was\r\nsomething so ungracious in the steward’s refusal, that I was unwilling\r\nto hazard another denial. From necessity I had learned to shave without\r\na mirror, while in the northern parts of Illinois, and now attempted the\r\noperation without soap, which I found so easy, that I continued the\r\npractice until reaching New York.\r\n\r\nThe cabin being in the stern of the vessel, I spent much of my time in\r\nthe forecastle, for the purpose of seeing the scenery, which brought me\r\nin contact with the crew, and many of the deck passengers. In this class\r\nof people I found a considerable change of manner from any I had\r\nformerly come in contact with. Many of them swore disgustingly, and\r\npossessed a general levity and coarseness of manner, but in no instance\r\ndid I experience incivility.\r\n\r\nI had witnessed a great many cases of fever in course of my journey, and\r\nthe accounts received in Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri, represented\r\nthe season as unhealthy, and the population suffering considerably from\r\nits effects. On reaching the Mississippi I learned cholera had scourged\r\nthe inhabitants in a dreadful manner, in the course of summer, and had\r\nnow subsided. Several cases of fever occurred amongst the deck\r\npassengers during the voyage, and a poor child sunk under its attack. A\r\nrude coffin was prepared by a person on board, and the remains of the\r\nlittle innocent were interred at Smithland, on the mouth of Cumberland\r\nriver, Kentucky. On the third day of the voyage, one of the firemen, a\r\nman of colour, became unwell, and I observed him rolling about near the\r\nfurnace, and suffering much, unheeded by those around him. At last the\r\nattention of the captain was called to him, and the services of a\r\nmedical gentleman, who was a cabin passenger, were requested. He\r\npronounced it a bad case of cholera, and the poor fellow was carried on\r\nshore soon afterwards in the agonies of death. The consternation on\r\nboard was great, and many of the passengers deserted the vessel.\r\n\r\nTowards the mouth of the Ohio, vast numbers of geese were seen sitting\r\non the extensive sand bars. The deck passengers often fired rifles at\r\ngeese and other birds without effect. Two or three bald-headed eagles\r\nwere seen quite near the vessel, and on Diamond Island five or six wild\r\nturkeys were observed running from the side of the river into the\r\nforest, and was the only time this bird was seen in a live state by me.\r\n\r\nThe vessels on the waters in the valley of Mississippi burn wood, and\r\nsupplies are found everywhere on the banks of the rivers, which are\r\nspeedily conveyed on board, with the assistance of the deck passengers,\r\nwho are bound to aid in the operation. During the time of taking in\r\nwood, I almost universally examined vegetation on the banks, and\r\nobtained many new seeds by so doing. I also had an opportunity of\r\nconversing with the inhabitants, who, in such situations, depend chiefly\r\non this trade for the means of subsisting. I was surprised at the\r\nvessels not using coal, which is very abundant in many places on the\r\nbanks, and could be easily transported to places where it is not. I am\r\nsatisfied coal would be found cheaper than wood, and if depots were\r\nformed, and provided with a crane to put the coal on board, the saving\r\nof time would be considerable in course of the voyage. None of the\r\nfurnaces are, however, at present constructed for burning coal, and a\r\nconsiderable time is likely to elapse before it gets a fair trial.\r\n\r\nIn coming up the Ohio, I observed a great number of boats, or rather\r\nboxes or arks, of various sizes and shapes, floating down the river\r\ntowards New Orleans, filled with farm produce, including sheep. These\r\narks are built of strong timbers, fitted up with apartments for the\r\nnavigators, and sold on reaching New Orleans, the crews returning by the\r\nsteam-boats. The numerous steam-boats do not seem to have diminished\r\nthis mode of conveying farm produce, and probably many of them are built\r\non shallow streams in the interior of the country, where steam-vessels\r\nnever can have access. These arks are simply kept in the current, which\r\nfloats them down, and in this country, where the farmer has so much\r\nleisure time in autumn and winter, must be a cheap mode of conveying\r\nproduce to market.\r\n\r\nLouisville is situated on the south bank of the Ohio, at the mouth of a\r\nsmall stream called Bear Grass, in the State of Kentucky. It consists of\r\nseveral streets running parallel to the river, and the houses are\r\ncomposed of brick. There are many steam-engines employed in sawing wood,\r\ngrinding wheat, and other purposes. Louisville is the most thriving\r\nplace on the waters of the coast connected with the Mississippi, and\r\ncontains about 14,000 inhabitants; it is 1448 miles distant from New\r\nOrleans by the river, and 590 from Washington.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Louisville I could not obtain admittance into either of\r\nthe two principal hotels, and afterwards had sufficient evidence to\r\nsatisfy me the denial was entirely owing to my shabby appearance. My\r\nthird application was at the American Hotel, a large and excellent\r\nestablishment; and feeling somewhat annoyed at the manner of my previous\r\nrefusals, I asked the bar-keeper if he would accommodate me for the\r\nnight, and he answered in a smart tone of voice, “Certainly, sir; we are\r\nservants of the public, but I hope you will eat something.” The inmates\r\nof the house were assembling for supper in the Exchange room, and on\r\nringing the bell, the rush up stairs into the banqueting apartment was\r\nexcessive, there being nearly two hundred individuals assembled. The\r\ncompany were settled down at two large tables, and every thing passed\r\noff well, but not in the same quiet way I had observed at other large\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen were fashionably dressed, and several of them swore and\r\nstormed at the waiters in a manner I never witnessed elsewhere in\r\nAmerica, which was perhaps owing to this being a slave state, and the\r\nindividuals themselves slave owners. The waiters were chiefly people of\r\ncolour; and much as I did feel disgusted at the language which in two or\r\nthree instances was directed to them, yet I had often heard waiters in\r\nBritain similarly addressed.\r\n\r\nMy bed was in a small apartment, indifferently lighted, in which were\r\ntwo bedsteads. The Exchange-room was as well filled in the morning with\r\nexpectants for breakfast as it had been in the preceding evening; and\r\nalthough Louisville is in a slave state, and the establishment of the\r\nhotel chiefly composed of such beings, a white person, well dressed and\r\nof good appearance, stood at the entrance of the house with the room,\r\nand brushed every gentleman’s coat and hat who required his services.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the town before nightfall, I at one time thought of visiting\r\nthe theatre, for the purpose of seeing Mr Forrest, a celebrated native\r\nactor, of whom the people of the States are extremely proud. On\r\nreferring to the playbill in the Exchange-room, I observed a line in\r\nsmall type at the bottom, intimating that people of colour were not\r\nadmitted. This appeared to me so absurd, to distinguish human beings at\r\na place of public amusement by their complexion, and so illiberal, that\r\nI altered my intention. In walking through the streets in the evening, I\r\nwas surprised at seeing so few people, and so many rats. These creatures\r\nwere swarming, and I saw more of them in half an hour than I had seen in\r\nthe previous course of my life.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I embarked on board the Champlain for Cincinnati, where I\r\nfound Mr Gemble and another passenger from the Helen Mar. The Champlain\r\nwas an excellent vessel, with the cabin in the bow, which is much more\r\nagreeable than when it is in the stern, by allowing objects to be seen\r\nwhen approaching, instead of receding from them. The steam-boats on the\r\neastern waters of the United States, and the Canadas, have their cabins\r\nin the hull of the vessel like those of Britain, and a deck above where\r\npassengers sit or walk. A different arrangement is followed on the\r\nwestern rivers. The lower part of the vessel is allotted for stowing\r\naway heavy freight, and the boilers are placed in the bow, with a cabin\r\nfor the gentlemen behind, and one immediately above, for the ladies. The\r\nfore-part of the second deck is for the deck passengers. In other cases,\r\nthe place for deck passengers is in the stern of the first deck, and the\r\nsecond one is divided, forming the ladies’ and gentlemen’s cabins. The\r\nHelen Mar was of the first arrangement, and the Champlain of the second.\r\nThe size of the steam-vessels varies from eighty to five hundred tons,\r\nthe smallest size being best suited for the summer months, when the\r\nrivers are low, and the largest can only be used from November to July.\r\nThey are narrow, and stand so much above the water, as to resemble a\r\nfloating-house. Almost all of them use high pressure engines, and are\r\nconsidered worn out in five or six years, except those made of live oak\r\nwhich last from eight to ten years. The perishable nature of the western\r\nsteam-boat property is, no doubt, in part owing to the materials of\r\nwhich it is composed, and the navigation, which, from currents,\r\nsand-bars, and sunken trees or snags, is the most trying and dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn passing from Louisville to Cincinnati, a distance of 132 miles, the\r\nChamplain was well-filled with passengers, who landed and embarked at\r\nmany intermediate places. The table was by no means so lavishly stored\r\nas that of the Helen Mar, and could not contain all the passengers, some\r\nof whom, after dinner, filled the berths of others without ceremony,\r\nstretching themselves at full length, with their boots on, and sleeping\r\nfor hours. The deck passengers, being in the stern of the lower deck,\r\nwere not seen, and the cabin ones exhibited a great diversity of\r\ncharacter. I got into conversation with an Irishman, who resided in\r\nKentucky, which had become his adopted country. He was plainly but\r\nrespectably dressed, and evidently without much education. After stating\r\nthe advantages of the States in many respects, and how determinedly all\r\nthe inhabitants would fight in their defence, he asked me where I came\r\nfrom? On answering St Louis, he rejoined, “where were you _raised_?” It\r\nwas my practice, while in the Western States, to answer readily every\r\nquestion that was put to me, for the purpose of ingratiating myself with\r\nthe people, by which alone I could obtain information from them, and\r\nensure personal comfort; and I must do them the justice to say, they\r\nseldom, in this respect, exceeded the people of my native country. On\r\nthe present occasion there was something so prying in the Irishman’s\r\nexpression of countenance and tone of voice, that I resolved to tease\r\nhim a little, and to his second question answered, “in the East.”\r\n\r\n“What part of the East?”\r\n\r\n“Europe.”\r\n\r\n“What part of Europe?”\r\n\r\n“Mungoswells.”\r\n\r\n“Where is that?”\r\n\r\n“Near Haddington.”\r\n\r\n“In what country is that?”\r\n\r\n“Scotland.”\r\n\r\nHere he told me that he was a native of Ireland; and I answered his\r\nlanguage had made me aware of that the moment he entered into\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Where do you stay?”\r\n\r\n“I am a wanderer on the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“Following the course of the river.”\r\n\r\n“What would you do if you were on shore?”\r\n\r\n“Follow my nose.”\r\n\r\n“What would you like to be employed at?”\r\n\r\n“In moving from place to place.”\r\n\r\n“Where do you reside?”\r\n\r\n“He had been told I was a wanderer, and might rely on what had been\r\nstated.” During this conversation, he did not seem to feel the import of\r\nmy answers, and continued in conversation sometime afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhile standing on deck, near the chimney, around which many gentlemen\r\nwere assembled, for the heat it afforded, a person who was chewing\r\ntobacco, sprinkled a mouthful of juice on the tails of my surtout, which\r\nhappened to be waving in the wind. As soon as the accident occurred, he\r\npulled out his handkerchief, and when wiping off the filth, apologized\r\nfor his conduct. There was something so sincere in the gentleman’s\r\nmanner, and in his anxiety to remove the stain, that induced me to say,\r\nhe could not have spit on any thing more worthless; and notwithstanding\r\nthe nature of our introduction, we continued on intimate terms for the\r\nremainder of the voyage. There was nothing in America to which I was so\r\nlong of getting reconciled, as the copious spitting, and my repugnance\r\nwas chiefly overcome by the accident to my surtout. The use of tobacco\r\nin every shape is, to a certain extent, an abomination, and the\r\npreference or dislike given to one mode of consumption over another,\r\narises from habit. The smoking Dutchman, chewing American, and snuffing\r\nScotchman, may be objects of disgust to each other, and all of them\r\nperhaps abhorred by a fastidious person who dislikes the use of tobacco\r\nin any shape.\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the shabbiness of my attire on leaving\r\nMontreal, and after having travelled so long and so roughly, often not\r\nunrobing for the night, my clothes had become literally threadbare. My\r\nhat was originally of white silk-web of bad quality, and now almost\r\nwithout wool. My appearance would have betokened mendicity in Britain,\r\nand procured pecuniary assistance from the humane; but in the countries\r\nthrough which I had latterly travelled, charity is never asked nor\r\nbestowed, yet my garb had its advantages: It brought me in contact with\r\nall classes of the inhabitants, without exciting suspicions of any kind,\r\nand enabled me to see them in their real character. My unpretending\r\nappearance and deportment could not call forth the democratic rudeness\r\nwhich assumed or presumptuous superiority seldom fails to experience, in\r\nalmost every portion of the United States; and the sycophant, if such\r\nexists in the valley of the Mississippi, had nothing to attract his\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe safety of my person and property may have been aided by the meanness\r\nof my dress, which possessed no allurement to the robber, thief, or\r\nswindler. My position as a traveller in the Western United States, and\r\nUpper Canada, differed from that of many British travellers who have\r\nvisited the countries, and I shall leave others to judge if it was\r\ncalculated to promote the object of my journey.\r\n\r\nIn passing up the Ohio, the temperature of the atmosphere became so\r\ncold, that I deliberated on the propriety of adding to my clothing,\r\nwhich was the more necessary from having left my flannel shirt in\r\nMichigan. The matter was decided by my shoulders and elbows making holes\r\nin my coat; after leaving Louisville, and on reaching Cincinnati, I\r\nadopted winter clothing, and concealed my external infirmities with a\r\ncoarse great-coat, which hath since amused my friends in Scotland, by\r\nthe queerness of its shape, and passed by the name of Mrs Trollope.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Ohio above Louisville, possesses more interest than\r\nthe lower part of the river, the hills on the banks being higher, and\r\nthe country better settled. Some beautiful villas are seen on\r\napproaching Cincinnati, which we reached before noon.\r\n\r\nWhen walking about Cincinnati, I observed, in several booksellers’\r\nwindows,—“Men and Manners in America, by the author of Cyril Thornton,”\r\nprinted in large characters, and purchased the volume. Mr Stewart’s\r\n“Three Years’ Residence in America,” and Mrs Trollope’s “Domestic\r\nManners of the Americans,” had been sent to New York with my trunks, but\r\nas the walking part of my journey was over, Cyril Thornton’s work was\r\nnot expected to incommode me. I had heard of the publication being in\r\nthe press before leaving Britain, and on opening the book, I naturally\r\nturned to the account of the country in which I was then situated. The\r\ndescription of the company in the steam-boats of the Ohio, was so\r\ndifferent from what I had experienced, that I shall quote the author’s\r\nremarks in passing down from Wheeling to Cincinnati:—“These western\r\nregions are undoubtedly the chosen abode of plenty. Provisions are so\r\ncheap, that no one ever dreams of economy. Three times a-day was the\r\ntable literally covered with dishes, wedged together as closely as a\r\nbattalion of infantry in solid square. Though the passengers were only\r\ntwenty in number, there was always dinner enough for a hundred. Joints,\r\nturkeys, hams, and chops, lay spread before us in admired confusion.\r\nBrandy bottles were located at judicious intervals, and porter was to be\r\nhad on paying for it. I had asked for wine, but in vain. So, being at\r\nthe luxurious city of Cincinnati, and tolerably tired of the poison\r\ncalled brandy, I sent for a bottle of champagne from the inn. The bottle\r\ncame, but on being opened, the contents were much more like sour cider\r\nthan champagne. In short, the stuff was decidedly too bad for drinking,\r\nand was accordingly pushed aside. But the appearance of this\r\nanomalous-looking flask evidently caused some commotion among the\r\npassengers. The wine was probably one which few of them had tasted, and\r\nmany of them were evidently determined to seize the earliest opportunity\r\nof enlarging their experience. ‘I should like a glass of your wine, sir,\r\nif you have no objections?’ said my old enemy the Virginian doctor. I\r\nimmediately pushed the bottle to him, and he filled his tumbler to the\r\nbrim. Observing this, the persons about him, without ceremony of any\r\nkind, seized the bottle, and its contents incontinently disappeared.\r\n\r\n“In regard to the passengers, truth compells me to say that any thing so\r\ndisgusting in human shape I had never seen. Their morals and their\r\nmanners were alike detestable. A cold and callous selfishness, a\r\ndisregard of all the decencies of society, were so apparent in feature,\r\nword, and action, that I found it impossible not to wish that their\r\ncatalogue of sins had been enlarged by one more—hypocrisy. Of hypocrisy,\r\nhowever, they were not guilty. The conversation in the cabin was\r\ninterlarded with the vilest blasphemy, not uttered in a state of mental\r\nexcitement, but with a coolness and deliberation truly fiendlike.\r\n\r\n“There was a Baptist clergyman on board, but his presence did not seem\r\nto operate as a restraint. The scene of drinking and gambling had no\r\nintermission. It continued day and night. The captain of the vessel, so\r\nfar from discouraging either vice, was one of the most flagrant\r\noffenders in both. He was decidedly the greatest gambler on board, and\r\nwas often so drunk as to be utterly incapable of taking command of the\r\nvessel. There were few female passengers; but with their presence we\r\nwere only honoured at meals. At all other times they prudently confined\r\nthemselves to their own cabin.\r\n\r\n“One circumstance may be mentioned, which is tolerably illustrative of\r\nthe general habits of the people. In every steam-boat there is a\r\n_public_ comb and hair-brush suspended by a string from the ceiling of\r\nthe cabin. These utensils are used by the whole body of the passengers,\r\nand their condition the pen of Swift could alone adequately describe.\r\nThere is no tooth-brush, simply, I believe, because the article is\r\nentirely unknown to the American toilet. A common towel, however, passes\r\nfrom hand to hand, and suffices for the perfunctory ablutions of the\r\nwhole party on board. It was often with great difficulty that I procured\r\nthe exclusive usufruct of one, and it was evident that the demand was\r\nnot only unusual but disagreeable.”\r\n\r\nThere is so much discrepancy between this account and what I\r\nexperienced, that it may be difficult for some people to believe the\r\nsame part of the world is alluded to. The time which elapsed between Mr\r\nHamilton’s visit and mine was a little more than three years, and in\r\ncourse of that time the manners and customs of the people must either\r\nhave undergone an extraordinary change, or we must have viewed things\r\nthrough a different medium. It is far from my intention to charge that\r\ngentleman with exaggeration or intentional misrepresentation, but\r\nobjects are so well known to be affected by circumstances, that it may\r\nbe worth while to enquire how he was situated to enable him to see and\r\njudge impartially. With his career in life and the place he occupied in\r\nBritish society, I am utterly unacquainted, and unless be is something\r\nimmeasurably above ordinary humanity, both would influence his opinions.\r\nBut it appears to me unfortunate that a man of such powers, as he has\r\nproved himself to be possessed of, should have sought information\r\nregarding “Men and Manners,” in a part of the world, accompanied by a\r\nservant, where he was ashamed to avail himself of his services. This\r\ncircumstance of itself was sufficient to sour him with all the country\r\ncontained, as well as to create in others an unfavourable impression\r\ntowards himself. It was surely an odd proceeding to send “for a bottle\r\nof champagne from the inn,” when he was on board a steam-boat. The\r\nreason assigned for having done so—“tolerably tired of the poison called\r\nbrandy”—perhaps accounts for much he has written regarding America—a\r\npotation of this liquid, followed by “champagne,” being one of the most\r\ndeceptious mediums which things can be viewed through, and I shall leave\r\nfuture visitants of the United States to determine whether much he has\r\ndescribed was reality, or the fantasies of his imagination.\r\n\r\nMy situation was different from Mr Hamilton’s, not having tasted any\r\nliquid but water and tea since my departure from Montreal, with\r\nexception of half a glass of spirits amongst water at Detroit, and the\r\nglass of wine at St Charles, formerly mentioned. I do not recollect of\r\nseeing brandy on the dinner-table of any steam-boat in America; and feel\r\nquite certain that neither wine nor spirits of any kind were on the\r\ntable of those of the Ohio and Mississippi. I did not see or hear of an\r\nintoxicated person on board of any steam-vessel but those of Lake\r\nOntario. “A _public_ comb and hair-brush, suspended by a string from the\r\nceiling of the cabin,” or placed in any other position in the vessel,\r\nwas not observed by me in the steam-boats of America, and I am sure they\r\ndid not exist in the vessels I sailed with. Afterwards, I observed a\r\nhair-brush suspended by a string in a passage-boat on the Erie Canal,\r\nand they are occasionally found in the bar-rooms of inferior hotels.\r\nPeople are not, however, compelled to use them, and they are certainly\r\nan accommodation to some individuals. A tooth-brush was used by almost\r\nevery passenger in the Helen Mar, and I remarked dozens of storekeepers\r\nat Detroit washing their teeth in the mornings at the door, and in one\r\nor two instances narrowly escaped being soused with superfluous water\r\nfrom tumblers they had been using.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the people at St Louis, and from that place to\r\nCincinnati, are unquestionably different from the inhabitants on the\r\nshores of the Atlantic, being rougher in all respects, but I did not\r\nwitness any thing approaching to rudeness or disgusting vulgarity\r\namongst cabin passengers. The firemen, engineers, and many of the crew\r\nof the steam-boats were habitual swearers, and so were many of the\r\nstage-drivers and passengers in travelling through Ohio. But this bad\r\nhabit did not pervade the inhabitants generally with whom I came in\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Cincinnati, I entered an excellent hotel in a square\r\nfronting the river, the name of which I have forgotten. On applying at\r\nthe bar I was requested, as usual, to enter my name; and on asking for a\r\nbedroom to wash, a bell was rung, and a man of colour, who answered it,\r\nwas desired to conduct me to No. 23, and to see that I got every thing I\r\nwanted. This was before any alteration had been made in my dress, and\r\nwater, towel, and soap, were supplied me. Indeed, water in my bedrooms\r\nwas furnished everywhere in the United States, with the exception of\r\nthat part of my tour from Detroit to Louisville.\r\n\r\nI had time to examine the greater part of the town before dinner, after\r\nwhich I walked to the top of the hills on the east side of the city, and\r\nthen to the west end. The situation of Cincinnati, as seen from the\r\nheight, is singularly fine, being in the midst of a circle of hills,\r\nthrough the centre of which the beautiful Ohio flows. The diameter of\r\nthe circle is about three miles, and the river is not seen beyond the\r\ncircle. The city is on the north side of the stream, and on the south,\r\nor Kentucky side, stand the thriving villages of Newport and Covington,\r\ndivided by the river Licking, which joins the Ohio. Cincinnati contains\r\nabout 30,000 inhabitants, the buildings are of brick, and many streets\r\nrun parallel and at right angles with the river. I found the market\r\nplentifully supplied with every commodity, in stalls and waggons, and\r\nthe bustle and activity of the place was much greater than I expected to\r\nfind in a city so remotely situated. The streets were clean at the time\r\nof my visit, and the general appearance of the place indicated\r\nconsiderable advancement in luxury. Coals sell at ten cents, wheat at\r\nfifty-six, Indian corn at twenty-five, and oats at twenty-two cents per\r\nbushel. I shall quote a few particulars relating to Cincinnati, from a\r\nrecent Philadelphia publication, entitled, a “View of the Valley of the\r\nMississippi.”\r\n\r\n“There are _ten founderies_, including a brass and bell foundery, and\r\none for casting types.\r\n\r\n“There are three or four _cotton factories_, about fifteen _rolling\r\nmills, and steam engine factories, and shops_.\r\n\r\n“There are _five breweries_.\r\n\r\n“There is a _button factory_, and a _steam coopering establishment_.\r\n\r\n“Two _steam flour-mills_, and five or six _steam saw-mills_.\r\n\r\n“There are probably not less than forty different manufacturing\r\nestablishments driven by steam-power.\r\n\r\n“The imports, of which dry goods are a principal item, exceed\r\n$5,000,000. The exports, consisting of various articles of produce, of\r\nwhich pork is the chief, and of manufactures, of which iron articles,\r\nand cabinet furniture, are the chief, probably exceed the imports in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n“There are two banks, and a savings’ fund association; two museums, very\r\ninteresting to strangers; and two hospitals.\r\n\r\n“There is a company which supplies the city with water, which is\r\nelevated by steam power from the Ohio.\r\n\r\n“There are several literary and scientific institutions, of which the\r\nLyceum, Athenæum—established by the Catholics, and which is really a\r\ncollege, and cost about $20,000—Medical College, having seven or eight\r\nprofessors, Academy of Medicine and Law, and Theological Seminary are\r\nthe chief.\r\n\r\n“In 1831, there were eighteen public schools, embracing 2,700 scholars,\r\nat an expense of $6,610 for teachers’ wages. This city is imitating the\r\nnoble example of Boston, in establishing free-schools for the whole\r\npopulation. The number of private schools and academies is great.\r\n\r\n“There are three library companies, which have, in all, nearly 10,000\r\nvolumes of books.\r\n\r\n“There are thirty-four charitable associations, and twenty-five\r\nreligious societies.\r\n\r\n“There are six Presbyterian churches, five Methodist, four Baptist, two\r\nEpiscopal, one Lutheran, one Associate, one Catholic, one Unitarian, one\r\nFriends’ Meeting, one Swedenborgian, one Jewish Synagogue, one African,\r\none Christian.\r\n\r\n“There are three daily, two semi-weekly, six weekly, (four of which are\r\nreligious,) two semi-monthly, two monthly, and one quarterly, (medical,)\r\npublications—sixteen in all, issued in this city.”\r\n\r\nIn four months, during 1831, there were issued from Cincinnati press,\r\n86,000 volumes, of which 20,300 were of original works. In the same\r\ntime, the periodical press issued 243,200 printed sheets.\r\n\r\nCincinnati is generally said to be in a declining state, but I could not\r\ndiscover evidence of decay. Houses were building, and bricks\r\nmanufacturing in all directions. Streets and roads were undergoing\r\nextensive improvement in and around the city, while villas were being\r\nerected on the surrounding heights. The ship yards were full of bustle,\r\nand craft of various kinds were rising into existence. At the close of\r\nthe year 1832, one hundred and thirty steam-boats had been built at\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nThe city is built on the site of some Indian tumuli, one of which I saw,\r\nnear the western extremity, in tolerable preservation. I hope the\r\ninhabitants will protect this monument of a former race, by enclosing it\r\nwith an iron railing, and adorning the foreground with flowers.\r\n\r\nI attended the theatre in the evening. Amongst the players were\r\nSinclair, Thorne, Mrs Knight, and Miss Clara Fisher. The audience were\r\nnumerous, and somewhat noisy in their plaudits.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture, seen from the waters of the Mississippi and Ohio, is\r\nvery limited, and which I cannot well describe. Cultivation becomes\r\nextended on approaching Cincinnati, and fields of wheat were seen on the\r\nsloping banks. The hills, three or four hundred feet high, which I\r\nascended, to the east of the city, were covered with verdant pasturage\r\nof grasses and clovers, on which excellent cattle and sheep were\r\nbrowsing. Waggon loads of pumpkins were passing into the town, and I\r\nobserved many working oxen eating this vegetable in courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Cincinnati to Detroit—Macadamized\r\n    road—Lebanon—Passengers—Agricultural Notices—Pawpaws—Cider\r\n    making—Hotels of the United States—Customs of the\r\n    Country—Columbus—Details to Sandusky—Mr Hamilton on the Prospects of\r\n    the Union—Sandusky—Cider making—Perrysburg—Mamee—Ohio—Michigan._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock next morning, I was seated in a stage-coach, on my way to\r\nCanada, through the state of Ohio, and no less than two hours were spent\r\nin calling and waiting on different passengers, before getting out of\r\nCincinnati. I was delighted to find Mr Gemble amongst the number who\r\nintended to have gone up the Ohio to Wheeling, by steam, but learning\r\nthe water was too low to admit of vessels sailing with certainty, he was\r\ninduced to proceed by land. When day dawned, we were passing through an\r\nundulating country, over an excellent macadamized road, newly formed by\r\na company, in the most complete manner, to the distance of twelve miles.\r\nThere was a toll-bar on the road, which is to be extended to\r\nSpringfield, in the state of Ohio, and there communicate with what is\r\ncalled the National road. We passed through the village of Lebanon, the\r\nparent seat in this country of the religious sect of Shakers. The\r\nvillage is of considerable size, and the bar-room of the hotel was\r\nfilled with a set of drunkards, which I had not seen any thing\r\nresembling since leaving Canada. Xenia, in Green County, is a neat\r\nplace, and we reached Springfield after dusk.\r\n\r\nNext morning we left Springfield at three o’clock with the same stage\r\nparty that had come from Cincinnati the day before. When light appeared,\r\nthe ground was thickly covered with hoar-frost, and ice was seen in\r\nseveral places. This was on the 12th October, in 40 degrees of latitude.\r\nTen miles from Springfield the stage had to wait half an hour for a\r\nchange of horses, the driver being in bed when we arrived. Here one of\r\nthe passengers, a lady travelling with her husband, complained of being\r\nsick and cold. A cup of coffee was suggested to her. The hostess of the\r\ntavern, a very old woman, boiled water and prepared coffee with\r\nincredible despatch. I know not whether the beverage was good, but it\r\nwas agreeable to see the old creature moving about like a girl in her\r\nteens, and manifesting anxiety to please her guests. The lady was from\r\nBaltimore, and had resided several months in the west, on account of her\r\nhealth. She had a most delicate appearance, a sylph-like form, regular\r\nfeatures, and a lively manner. Notwithstanding the coldness of the\r\nweather, and her delicate state of health, she was dressed in silk\r\nstockings, and it was with reluctance she consented to draw a pair of\r\nworsted ones over her shoes, which her husband purchased for her. Like\r\nmany of her countrywomen, she had feet and ankles of exquisite\r\nformation, and perhaps in the display of this gift of nature, she made a\r\nsacrifice of her health.\r\n\r\nWe reached Columbus in time for dinner, where I remained for the night,\r\nthe stage proceeding on with the party for Wheeling. I found myself\r\npleasantly situated with the passengers from Cincinnati, who conversed\r\nsensibly on a variety of subjects, and made themselves agreeable to each\r\nother. On leaving Columbus, each of them came up, and bade me farewell.\r\nIn particular, I regretted parting with Mr Gemble, whose moral worth and\r\nunobstrusive manners pleased me the more I was in his company.\r\n\r\nThe country from Cincinnati to Springfield, Ohio, was chiefly a good\r\nclay of a yellow colour. The surface undulating, and in some places\r\npicturesque. The farm-houses were of large size, and generally brick.\r\nThe soil was dry, and where seen, in making the road, six feet deep, of\r\nyellow coloured clay. There were no furrows in the fields, and wheat was\r\nabove ground, and well sown. Herds of cattle and flocks of sheep were\r\nseen browsing on pastures as verdant as if in spring. Numbers of\r\nhandsome hogs were fattening, in enclosures of worm fence, on Indian\r\ncorn, without straw to lie on. Hogs are generally fatted in the open air\r\nin America, and whether kept in enclosures or small pens I never saw one\r\nof them have straw, and they make their beds in mud or sand. The waggons\r\nseen moving towards Cincinnati were in charge of men who rode on the\r\nshaft-horse, whether the vehicle was drawn by two or more horses. The\r\ncountry for twenty miles east of Springfield is level, rather wet, and\r\nnot so fertile as that from Cincinnati. After passing this distance,\r\nthere are many small prairies, most of which are wet and uncultivated.\r\nThis tract is thinly settled, the soil, clay of a dark colour, and\r\ninferior to the yellow tinged clay. The bottoms of the Scioto are fine\r\nrich soil.\r\n\r\nAfter dining at Columbus, I strolled into the woods north of the village\r\nin search of the pawpaw fruit, which I had heard much extolled by some\r\nof my fellow-travellers. This plant grows plentifully as underwood on\r\nmost of the rich soils in this part of the country. I found the fruit\r\ngrowing on slender trees or shrubs fifteen or twenty feet high; it\r\nresembles, in size, shape, and colour, the jargonelle pear of Britain. I\r\nfound them variable in quality, and the best might rank with a\r\nthird-rate pear of Scotland. The forests were now clothed in the\r\nsplendour of autumn, and the richness and variety of their tints was of\r\nthe most pleasing description. The oak, maple, beech, and dogwood,\r\nseemed to vie in brilliancy, and I often observed many leaves on the\r\nsame lateral branch, exhibiting every shade from vivid green to the\r\ndarkest purple.\r\n\r\nI found so much to interest me in the productions of the forest and its\r\nfeathered inhabitants, that my walk was insensibly prolonged, till at\r\nlength the declining sun reminded me of the necessity of returning to\r\nColumbus. On emerging from the forest, I observed people engaged in\r\nmaking cider, and walked towards them to enquire my way, having lost the\r\ndirection of the city, by wandering in the woods. The apples were\r\ncollected into an immense heap, from which two men were engaged in\r\ncarrying them to a mill, consisting of vertical cylinders, turned by the\r\npower of two oxen, which reduced the fruit to a pulp. A shovel was used\r\nin removing the pulp, which, by means of straw and wattles, was piled\r\nabove a receptacle for the juice, and pressed by a powerful screw. The\r\npeople engaged in cider-making, asked me to partake of the expressed\r\njuice, and to fill my pockets with the choicest fruit. I learned from\r\nthem cider was very plentiful this season, and did not pay much more\r\nthan the expense of making, being delivered at Columbus for 75 cents per\r\nbarrel of 32 gallons. Some forest land, of medium quality, in the\r\nneighbourhood, had lately been sold by public sale at $2½ and $2¾ per\r\nacre. Wheat at the present time was worth 50 cents, and Indian corn 20\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\nI found my distance from Columbus was five miles, and supper was over\r\nbefore I reached the National hotel. On stating to the bar-keeper I had\r\nbeen detained in the woods, he ordered me fresh tea; and although I\r\nmentioned to him it was not my practice to eat meat in the evening, a\r\nnewly broiled fowl was placed before me, and a variety of preserves.\r\nNext morning, after the usual preparatory bell had tolled for breakfast,\r\nthe landlord called me personally, stating, that as I was a stranger in\r\nthe country, and might not be aware of its customs, the breakfast would\r\nbe on the table in ten minutes. The waiters were all white people, smart\r\nin their calling, and attentive to guests.\r\n\r\nI found the hotels gradually improve on leaving Springfield, Illinois,\r\nand many of those in the state of Ohio appeared to be every thing a\r\nreasonable person could wish, with the exception of the want of\r\nsingle-bedded rooms. Water was always placed for washing without being\r\nasked for, and a bell communicated with each room. The waiters and helps\r\nof the States are said to dislike being summoned by the sound of a bell,\r\nand many travellers have assigned this as a reason for the want of\r\nbells. But such a feeling in all probability never existed, as the\r\nguests of every hotel are first warned, and afterwards summoned to each\r\nmeal, by sound of bell, and it is preposterous to say waiters are averse\r\nto the like call. Meals are served at fixed hours, when all the company\r\nsit down together. In good establishments, the principal joints at\r\ndinner are carved by the landlord and waiters, often at side tables, and\r\nthe company seldom assist in the office. Abundance of iced water is on\r\nthe table during summer, occasionally cider, and very rarely brandy.\r\nWine may be had for payment. The company leave the banqueting room when\r\nthe meal is over, and do not gain admittance until summoned. A number of\r\nsmart attentive waiters skip about the room, and often anticipate your\r\nwants. They are generally addressed in a whisper, and in all the eastern\r\nstates of the Union a loud tone is never heard at table. The conduct of\r\nsome people in Britain, who command attention by oaths and noise, does\r\nnot suit this region of America, where the mild and unassuming are never\r\nneglected. A friend of mine, on his first entrance to the public tables\r\nof New York, spoke to the waiters in the strains he had unfortunately\r\naccustomed himself to in Britain; they pretended not to hear him, and he\r\nfound difficulty in getting his plate changed; while his companions, by\r\nadopting a different course, had the waiters pressing them to the\r\nprincipal dishes on the side-table, and paying the most assiduous\r\nattention. Civility is at all times duly appreciated by the\r\nestablishment of hotels, and foreigners will find much annoyance in\r\nattempting to dispense with it. The morning and evening meals are served\r\nwith the same regularity, and ample attendance, as the dinner, &c. A\r\nprofusion of animal food is placed on the table, and the quantity\r\nincreases in proportion to want of refinement in the people of the\r\ndistrict. Boots and shoes are deposited at night in a fixed place, where\r\nthey are found cleaned in the morning. Slippers, and bedroom lights, are\r\nobtained at the bar. As a general rule, wants are stated at the bar, and\r\nfrom this place orders are given to servants for supplying them. All the\r\nbells of the house communicate with the bar-room, and the bar-keeper\r\nsees that the call of a bell is attended to. Throughout the whole of my\r\nintercourse with hotels in the United States, I did not receive an\r\nuncivil answer, or experience neglect from any one connected with the\r\nestablishment, and every request which I made was cheerfully complied\r\nwith. The landlords are much less fawning in manner than those of\r\nBritain, but equally civil and anxious to oblige.\r\n\r\nThe hotels of America are such as might be expected from the state of\r\nthe country. Servants being particularly expensive, and difficult to be\r\nhad, is the cause for having fixed hours for meals, and one table for\r\nthe company as well as for most orders passing through the bar-keeper.\r\nWere another system adopted, a greater number of servants would be\r\nnecessary, and there would be more difficulty in obtaining them. The\r\nplain and meagre furnishing of the hotels may also be traced to\r\nexpensiveness of servants, and so also may the number of people which\r\nfrequent them. The furniture of the bedrooms, consisting of a bedstead,\r\nwithout posts or curtains, and counterpane of small size, washing-stand,\r\nand solitary chair, seemed to me admirably fitted for promoting a\r\ncirculation of air, which was the greatest luxury during the season I\r\nwas in the country, and I doubt much if bedroom furnishings will be more\r\nample in summer, when the wealth of the population becomes greater than\r\nit now is.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of air, in connexion with shade from the sun-rays, will\r\naccount for the use of the calash as a head-dress for females, so\r\ngenerally met with in the States of New England, and which I imagine to\r\nbe the most agreeable summer wear that can be devised. On the same\r\ngrounds may be justified the New England gigs with hoods, having an\r\naperture behind; thus the customs of a country will generally be found\r\nto have originated from circumstances connected with it, and to be well\r\nsuited to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nColumbus is the capital of the state of Ohio, and beautifully situated\r\non the east bank of the river Scioto. The public buildings are extensive\r\nand good. The village having been founded in 1812, the buildings, which\r\nare chiefly of brick, are well arranged. The state prison is a new and\r\nsubstantial stone-building. The population is about 3000. A lateral\r\nbranch of the Ohio and Erie canal communicates with Columbus.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after breakfast, I left Columbus for Sandusky city,\r\nformerly called Portland, on Lake Erie, passing through Delaware,\r\nMarion, and Bucyrus. The first part of the road lay on the banks of the\r\nWhetstone, a small river with very little bottom land. The country was\r\nthinly settled; and the soil second rate. The night was passed in a very\r\nbad hotel at Marion, and by three o’clock in the morning I was again in\r\nthe stage. When day dawned, the stage was passing through a country\r\nbetween oak-opening and prairie, seemingly wet and unsettled. A good\r\ndeal of forest was also passed through, thinly peopled. I reached\r\nSandusky a little after nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe stage was nearly empty all the way from Columbus to Sandusky. A\r\nyoung joiner travelled from Columbus to Marion. Two striplings rode a\r\nmile or two near the village of Caroline, who were rude swearing\r\nfellows, and smelling strongly of onions and whisky.\r\n\r\nThe hotel at Sandusky was small and crowded with passengers. I found\r\nmyself ushered into a small bedroom, with two individuals, with a bed\r\nfor each. One of the persons rose in the middle of the night, smoked\r\ntobacco, and made himself as disagreeable as possible. The other opened\r\nthe window to admit air to purify the sty. This was the only unpleasant\r\ncircumstance that occurred to me from sleeping in apartments with\r\nothers, and sufficiently illustrates how disagreeable the practice may\r\noccasionally become.\r\n\r\nSandusky city is a small village on Lake Erie, containing perhaps five\r\nor six hundred souls, and has a considerable trade. There is plenty of\r\nstone in the immediate neighbourhood, and some of the buildings are of\r\nthis material. I found the price of beef at Sandusky was from three to\r\nfive cents per lb., and hind quarters of mutton four cents. Wheat was 75\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have proceeded from Sandusky to Detroit by one of\r\nthe steam-boats passing up Lake Erie, but tempestuous gales of wind a\r\nday or two before my arrival, having totally wrecked one vessel and\r\ndisabled another, I was detained two days in suspense. I could not go\r\nfar from the hotel during this period, lest a steamer should pass in the\r\ninterval; and my time was in part occupied in reading Mr Hamilton’s\r\nbeautifully written work of “Men and Manners in America.”\r\n\r\nIn the early part of my tour, I remarked that, without sound judgment to\r\ndiscriminate and appreciate information, the gleanings and impressions\r\nof a traveller will be as apt to mislead as instruct, and his\r\nlucubrations will often be found more illustrative of his own character\r\nthan of the people and country he visits. When penning this sentence, I\r\nhad not another individual in view than the one treated of, and it is,\r\nperhaps, fraught with more truth than may at first sight appear. The\r\nwielders of the pen and pencil seem to be fond of portraying their own\r\nlikeness, and the narrative of most travellers will be found stamped\r\nwith their character. Truth ought to be the first object with every\r\nwriter of travels, and is perhaps, like beauty, “when unadorned, adorned\r\nthe most,” and wherever it is lost sight of, the highest endowments may\r\nbecome prostituted in misleading others. It must, however, be admitted,\r\nthat the best intentioned writer may become the dupe of appearances,\r\nresulting, perhaps, from his own feelings and prejudices. There are also\r\nsome writers who aim at producing an effect on their readers unconnected\r\nwith the subject treated of, and in such cases a traveller’s narrative\r\nfrequently becomes absolute fiction. I shall not say in which class of\r\ntravels “Men and Manners in America” may be ranked, or whether parts of\r\nthe work appertain to different classes; but I do not hesitate in\r\nsaying, that the author’s conclusions did not always appear to me to be\r\njust or consistent with sentiments expressed in other parts of the work.\r\nThis seemed to be particularly the case in some speciously written\r\nparagraphs on the political prospects of the Union, which many of the\r\npeople in Britain, who read the work, did not perhaps observe.\r\n\r\n“In that city (New York) a separation is rapidly taking place between\r\nthe different orders of society. The operative classes have already\r\nformed themselves into a society, under the name of ‘_The Workies_,’ in\r\ndirect opposition to those who, more favoured by nature or fortune,\r\nenjoy the luxuries of life without the necessity of manual labour. These\r\npeople make no secret of their demands, which, to do them justice, are\r\nfew and emphatic. They are published in the newspapers, and may be read\r\non half the walls of New York. Their first postulate is ‘EQUAL AND\r\nUNIVERSAL EDUCATION.’ It is false, they say, to maintain that there is\r\nat present no privileged order, no practical aristocracy, in a country\r\nwhere distinctions of education are permitted. That portion of the\r\npopulation whom the necessity of manual labour cuts off from the\r\nopportunity of enlarged acquirement, is in fact excluded from all the\r\nvaluable offices of state. As matters are now ordered in the United\r\nStates, these are distributed exclusively among one small class of the\r\ncommunity, while those who constitute the real strength of the country,\r\nhave barely a voice in the distribution of those loaves and fishes,\r\nwhich they are not permitted to enjoy. There does exist, then, they\r\nargue, an aristocracy of the most odious kind,—an aristocracy of\r\nknowledge, education, and refinement, which is inconsistent with the\r\ntrue democratic principle of absolute equality. They pledge themselves,\r\ntherefore, to exert every effort, mental and physical, for the abolition\r\nof this flagrant injustice. They proclaim it to the world as a nuisance\r\nwhich must be abated, before the freedom of an American be something\r\nmore than a mere empty boast. They solemnly declare that they will not\r\nrest satisfied, till every citizen in the United States shall receive\r\nthe same degree of education, and start fair in the competition for the\r\nhonours and the offices of the state. As it is of course impossible—and\r\nthese men know it to be so—to educate the labouring classes to the\r\nstandard of the richer, it is their professed object to reduce the\r\nlatter to the same mental condition with the former; to prohibit all\r\nsupererogatory knowledge; to have a maximum of acquirement, beyond which\r\nit shall be punishable to go.\r\n\r\n“But those who limit their views to the mental degradation of their\r\ncountry, are in fact the MODERATES of the party. There are others who\r\nstill go farther, and boldly advocate the introduction of an AGRARIAN\r\nLAW, and a periodical division of property. These unquestionably\r\nconstitute the _extreme gauche_ of the Worky Parliament, but still they\r\nonly follow out the principles of their violent neighbours, and\r\neloquently dilate on the justice and propriety of every individual being\r\nequally supplied with food and clothing; on the monstrous iniquity of\r\none man riding in his carriage, while another walks on foot, and, after\r\nhis drive, discussing a bottle of Champagne, while many of his\r\nneighbours are shamefully compelled to be content with the pure element.\r\nOnly equalize property, they say, and neither would drink Champagne or\r\nwater, but both would have brandy, a consummation worthy of centuries of\r\nstruggle to attain.\r\n\r\n“All this is nonsense, undoubtedly, nor do I say that this party, though\r\nstrong in New York, is yet so numerous or so widely diffused as to\r\ncreate immediate alarm. In the elections, however, for the civic offices\r\nof the city, their influence is strongly felt; and there can be no\r\ndoubt, that as population becomes more dense, and the supply of labour\r\nshall equal, or exceed the demand for it, the strength of this party\r\nmust be enormously augmented. Their ranks will always be recruited by\r\nthe needy, the idle, and the profligate; and, like a rolling snow-ball,\r\nit will gather strength and volume as it proceeds, until at length it\r\ncomes thundering with the force and desolation of an avalanche.\r\n\r\n“This event may be distant, but it is not the less certain on that\r\naccount. It is nothing to say, that the immense extent of fertile\r\nterritory yet to be occupied by an unborn population, will delay the day\r\nof ruin. It will delay, but it cannot prevent it. The traveller, at the\r\nsource of the Mississippi, in the very heart of the American continent,\r\nmay predict with perfect certainty, that, however protracted the\r\nwanderings of the rivulet at his feet, it must reach the ocean at last.\r\nIn proportion as the nearer lands are occupied, it is very evident that\r\nthe region to which emigration will be directed must of necessity be\r\nmore distant. The pressure of population, therefore, will augment in the\r\nAtlantic States, and the motives to removal become gradually weaker.\r\nIndeed, at the present rate of extension, the circle of occupied\r\nterritory must, before many generations, be so enormously enlarged, that\r\nemigration will be confined wholly to the Western States. Then, and not\r\ntill then, will come the trial of the American constitution; and until\r\nthat trial has been past, it is mere nonsense to appeal to its\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n“Nor is this period of trial apparently very distant. At the present\r\nratio of increase, the population of the United States doubles itself in\r\nabout twenty-four years; so that in half a century it will amount to\r\nabout fifty millions, of which ten millions will be slaves, or, at all\r\nevents, a degraded caste, cut off from all the rights and privileges of\r\ncitizenship. Before this period, it is very certain that the pressure of\r\nthe population, on the means of subsistence, especially in the Atlantic\r\nStates, will be very great. The price of labour will have fallen, while\r\nthat of the necessaries of life must be prodigiously increased. The\r\npoorer and more suffering class will want the means of emigrating to a\r\ndistant region of unoccupied territory. Poverty and misery will be\r\nabroad; the great majority of the people will be without property of any\r\nkind, except the thewes and sinews with which God has endowed them; they\r\nwill choose legislators under the immediate pressure of privation; and\r\nif in such circumstances, any man can anticipate security of property,\r\nhis conclusion must be founded, I suspect, rather on the wishes of a\r\nsanguine temperament, than on any rational calculation of probabilities.\r\n\r\n“It is the present policy of the government to encourage and stimulate\r\nthe premature growth of a manufacturing population. In this it will not\r\nbe successful, but no man can contemplate the vast internal resources of\r\nthe United States,—the varied productions of their soil—the unparalleled\r\nextent of river communication—the inexhaustible stores of coal and iron\r\nspread even on the surface—and doubt that the Americans are destined to\r\nbecome a great manufacturing nation. Whenever increase of population\r\nshall have reduced the price of labour to a par with that of other\r\ncountries, these advantages will come into full play; the United States\r\nwill then meet England on fair terms in every market of the world, and,\r\nin many branches of industry at least, will attain an unquestioned\r\nsuperiority. Huge manufacturing cities will spring up in various\r\nquarters of the Union, the population will congregate in masses, and all\r\nthe vices incident to such a condition of society will attain speedy\r\nmaturity. Millions of men will depend for subsistence on the demand for\r\na particular manufacture, and yet this demand will of necessity be\r\nliable to perpetual fluctuation. When the pendulum vibrates in one\r\ndirection, there will be an influx of wealth and prosperity; when it\r\nvibrates in the other, misery, discontent, and turbulence will spread\r\nthrough the land. A change of fashion, a war, the glut of a foreign\r\nmarket, a thousand unforeseen and inevitable accidents are liable to\r\nproduce this, and deprive multitudes of bread, who but a month before\r\nwere enjoying all the comforts of life. Let it be remembered, that in\r\nthe suffering class will be practicably deposited the whole political\r\npower of the state; that there can be no military force to maintain\r\ncivil order and protect property; and to what quarter, I should be glad\r\nto know, is the rich to look for security, either of person or fortune?\r\n\r\n“There will be no occasion, however, for convulsion or violence. The\r\n_Worky_ convention will only have to choose representatives of their own\r\nprinciples, in order to accomplish a general system of spoliation, in\r\nthe most legal and constitutional manner. It is not even necessary that\r\na majority of the Federal legislature should concur in this. It is\r\ncompetent to the government of each state to dispose of the property\r\nwithin their own limits as they think proper, and whenever a _numerical_\r\nmajority of the people shall be in favour of an Agrarian law, there\r\nexists no counteracting influence to prevent, or even retard its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n“I have had the advantage of conversing with many of the most eminent\r\nAmericans of the Union, on the future prospects of their country, and I\r\ncertainly remember none who did not admit that a period of trial, such\r\nas I have ventured to describe, is, according to all human calculation,\r\ninevitable. Many of them reckoned much on education as a means of\r\nsafety, and, unquestionably, in a country where the mere power of\r\nbreathing carries with it the right of suffrage, the diffusion of sound\r\nknowledge is always essential to the public security. It unfortunately\r\nhappens, however, that in proportion as poverty increases, not only the\r\nmeans but the desire of instruction are necessarily diminished. The man\r\nwhose whole energies are required for the supply of his bodily wants,\r\nhas neither time nor inclination to concern himself about his mental\r\ndeficiencies, and the result of human experience does not warrant us in\r\nreckoning on the restraint of individual cupidity, where no obstacle\r\nexists to its gratification, by any deliberate calculation of its\r\nconsequences on society. There can be no doubt, that if men could be\r\nmade wise enough to act on an enlarged and enlightened view of their own\r\ninterest, government might be dispensed with altogether; but what\r\nstatesman would legislate on the probability of such a condition of\r\nsociety, or rely on it as a means of future safety?\r\n\r\n“The general answer, however, is, that the state of things I have\r\nventured to describe, is very distant. ‘It is enough,’ they say, ‘for\r\neach generation to look to itself, and we leave it to our descendants\r\nsome centuries hence to take care of their interests as we do ours. We\r\nenjoy all manner of freedom and security under our present constitution,\r\nand really feel very little concern about the evils which may afflict\r\nour posterity.’ I cannot help believing, however, that the period of\r\ntrial is somewhat less distant than such reasoners comfort themselves by\r\nimagining; but if the question be conceded that democracy necessarily\r\nleads to anarchy and spoliation, it does not seem that the mere length\r\nof road travelled over is a point of much importance. This, of course,\r\nwould vary according to the peculiar circumstances of every country in\r\nwhich the experiment might be tried. In England, the journey would be\r\nperformed with railway velocity. In the United States, with the\r\nadvantages they possess, it may continue a generation or two longer, but\r\nthe termination is the same. The doubt regards time, not destination.\r\n\r\n“At present the United States are perhaps more safe from revolutionary\r\ncontention than any country in the world. But this safety consists in\r\none circumstance alone. _The great majority of the people are possessed\r\nof property_; have what is called a stake in the hedge; and are,\r\ntherefore, by interest, opposed to all measures that may tend to its\r\ninsecurity. It is for such a condition of society that the present\r\nconstitution was framed; and could this great bulwark of prudent\r\ngovernment be rendered as permanent as it is effective, there could be\r\nno assignable limit to the prosperity of a people so favoured. But truth\r\nis undeniable, that as population increases, another state of things\r\nmust necessarily arise, and one, unfortunately, never dreamt of in the\r\nphilosophy of American legislators. The majority of the people will then\r\nconsist of men without property of any kind, subject to the immediate\r\npressure of want, and then will be decided the great struggle between\r\nproperty and numbers; on the one side hunger, rapacity, and physical\r\npower; reason, justice, and helplessness on the other. The weapons of\r\nthis fearful contest are already forged; the hands will soon be born\r\nthat are to wield them. At all events, let no man appeal to the\r\nstability of the American government as being established by experience,\r\ntill this trial has been overpast. Forty years are no time to test the\r\npermanence, or, if I may so speak, the vitality of a constitution, the\r\nimmediate advantages of which are strongly felt, and the evils latent\r\nand comparatively remote.”\r\n\r\nOn re-perusing the quoted paragraphs, the love of champagne and brandy\r\nwas conspicuous in the second one, and the whole of them seemed like a\r\nmaudlin dream, in which truth and probability were altogether wanting,\r\ntold in strains admirably fitted to delight the ear and obscure the\r\nunderstanding of the reader. To me, who had made an extensive tour in\r\nthe territory of the United States, and from all I had seen personally,\r\nand learned from the best sources of information, concluded that\r\nnine-tenths of the surface are still unemployed in the production of\r\nhuman sustenance, the idea of an agrarian law was ludicrous in the\r\nextreme. Whether there is such a society as “_The Workies_,” and my\r\nafter enquiries while at New York rendered the point doubtful, did not\r\nseem to affect the matter, as the only legitimate inference that could\r\nreasonably be deduced from the sentiments which Mr Hamilton has imputed\r\nto its members, is, that America does not exempt humanity from\r\naberrations of mind. This seems to be admitted in the third paragraph,\r\nwhere it is stated, “all this is undoubtedly nonsense,” yet the dream\r\nwhich is confessedly founded on man’s infirmity, has been received by a\r\nportion of the British public as infallible wisdom. The quotations being\r\nfounded on “nonsense,” do not admit of criticism. An ordinary mind,\r\nhowever, cannot fail of observing that in almost every paragraph, the\r\nauthor raises up and demolishes a fantasy, and turns from one position\r\nto another, like fevered excitement tossing on an uneasy couch.\r\n\r\nThe following quotations from “Men and Manners in America” are of a\r\ndifferent tenor from the preceding ones. “It is the fashion to call the\r\nUnited States the land of liberty and equality. If the equality be\r\nunderstood simply as implying that there exists no privileged order in\r\nAmerica, the assertion, though not strictly true,[2] may pass. In any\r\nwider acceptation, it is mere nonsense. There is quite as much practical\r\nequality in Liverpool as New York. The magnates of the Exchange do not\r\nstand less proudly in the latter city than in the former; nor are their\r\nwives and daughters less forward in supporting their pretensions. In\r\nsuch matters legislative enactments can do nothing. Man’s vanity, and\r\nthe desire of distinction, inherent in his nature, cannot be repressed.\r\nIf obstructed in one outlet, it will only gush forth with greater\r\nvehemence at another. The most contemptible of mankind has some talent\r\nof mind or body—some attraction—virtue—accomplishment—dexterity—or gift\r\nof fortune—in short, something real or imaginary, on which he arrogates\r\nsuperiority to those around him. The rich man looks down upon the poor,\r\nthe learned on the ignorant, the orator on him unblessed with the gift\r\nof tongues, and he that is a true-born gentleman, and stands upon the\r\nhonour of his birth, despises the _roturier_ whose talents have raised\r\nhim to an estimation in society, perhaps superior to his own.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  “Not strictly true, because in many of the states the right of\r\n  suffrage is made dependent on a certain qualification in property. In\r\n  Virginia, in particular, this qualification is very high.”\r\n\r\n“Thus it is with the men, and with the fairer sex assuredly it is not\r\ndifferent. No woman, conscious of attraction, was ever a republican in\r\nher heart. Beauty is essentially despotic—it uniformly asserts its\r\npower, and never yet consented to a surrender of privilege. I have\r\ncertainly heard it maintained in the United States, that all men are\r\nequal, but never did I hear that assertion from the lips of a lady. On\r\nthe contrary, the latter is always conscious of the full extent of her\r\nclaims of preference to admiration, and is never satisfied till she\r\nfeels them to be acknowledged. And what zephyr is too light to fill the\r\ngossamer sails of woman’s vanity! The form of a feature, the whiteness\r\nof a hand, the shade of a ringlet, a cap, a feather, a trinket, a smile,\r\na motion—all, or any of them, or distinctions yet finer and more\r\nshadowy, if such there be—are enough, here as elsewhere, to constitute\r\nthe sign and shibboleth of her fantastic supremacy. It is in vain,\r\ntherefore, to talk of female republicans; there exists, and can exist,\r\nno such being on either side of the Atlantic, for human nature is the\r\nsame on both.\r\n\r\n“In truth, the spirit of aristocracy displays itself in this commercial\r\ncommunity in every variety of form. One encounters it at every turn.”\r\n\r\nIt must be evident to every person who has visited the United States,\r\nthat wealth has already obtained a prominent place in many parts of the\r\ncountry. That there are distinctions and classes in society, will not\r\nadmit of doubt; and from the constitution of human nature, it cannot be\r\notherwise in a civilized and numerous population. The wealthy, the wise,\r\nthe proud, the profligate, the virtuous, and the vicious, will associate\r\nwith people of the same character, in despite of every means that could\r\nbe devised for their separation; and it is perhaps well for society that\r\nsuch is the case. The vain and frivolous are harmless creatures. The\r\nproud man may puff himself into bigness, like the frog in the fable\r\nimitating the ox, and assume the emblems of luxury and pomp with\r\nimpunity. The form of aristocracy meets the eye in all the social\r\nrelations of life. There is no such thing as equality in the abstract\r\nsense of the term, with the political privileges of the inhabitants, the\r\nright of franchise varying in different States, and a qualification\r\nbeing requisite in all of them.\r\n\r\n_Liberty and equality_, as understood in Britain, is not to be found\r\namongst the inhabitants of the United States. The people must obey the\r\nlaws, which impartially affect the whole population, except in the case\r\nof suffrage; a privileged class by inheritance, creation, wealth, or\r\npurchase, being unknown. The laws are founded on the principles of\r\nfreedom, and the mass of the population may be said to be politically\r\nequal. Here liberty and equality of the United States is applicable only\r\nto the political condition of the inhabitants, and in this relation must\r\nbe taken in a restricted sense.\r\n\r\nAristocracy seems inseparable from civilized society, and an individual,\r\nby attending to the communings of his own heart, will perhaps be\r\nconvinced that its spirit pervades the life veins of humanity. In almost\r\nevery quarter of the globe, it has at some period attained strength, and\r\nfrom the earliest ages, the earth has been watered with the blood of the\r\nbest and bravest of mankind, in attempts to check the workings of its\r\nspirit. The form of aristocracy is already raised in the United States,\r\nand many of the citizens, when conversing with me on the institutions\r\nand inhabitants of their country, strongly displayed a feeling of\r\naristocracy. If there is latent danger to the constitution of the Union,\r\nin the present state of things, it is from the seeds of aristocracy.\r\n\r\nHuman nature is said to be the same on both sides of the Atlantic, and\r\nthe population of the United States and Britain having sprung from a\r\ncommon source, and inheriting the same natural dispositions, the growth\r\nof aristocracy in the former might be inferred from the experience of\r\nthe latter, provided all the circumstances affecting the inhabitants\r\nwere similar. But history does not furnish a parallel to the United\r\nStates, and the experience of past ages, and analogies of other\r\ncountries, are inapplicable to them.\r\n\r\nThe United States were first settled by people seeking relief from\r\nreligious persecution, who, in the neighbourhood of Boston, worshipped\r\nthe Author of the Universe according to their conscience, which liberty\r\nhad been denied them in England. It may, perhaps, not be going too far\r\nto suppose the finger of Providence pointed the way to the pilgrims,\r\nsince which, many of the persecuted of the human race have found a\r\nsanctuary in the same territory. When the conduct of the mother-country\r\ngoaded the colonies to rebellion, they shook off her yoke at an\r\nenlightened period of the world, with the history of past ages before\r\ntheir eyes, and almost without an obstacle to adopt the advantages, and\r\nshun the evils recorded. The career of the States is evidence of the\r\njudicious proceedings of the inhabitants, and the many privileges which\r\nthey enjoy can only be lost by their own corrupt and sinful venality.\r\n\r\nThe United States having risen and struggled into existence in\r\nopposition to despotic power, a dislike of tyranny, and love of liberty,\r\npervades the inhabitants, and the institutions of the country are\r\ncalculated to nurture and retain such feelings. The unexampled and\r\ngrowing prosperity of the country—the recent progression in the\r\ngovernments of almost all European states, and more particularly in\r\nBritain—the mother-country—will, doubtless, tend to strengthen the\r\nprinciples on which the Union has been formed. But human nature often\r\ndeparts from principle, and there cannot be a doubt that aristocracy,\r\nwhich is already deep-rooted and flourishing amongst the people, will,\r\nwhen aided by wealth and luxury, and their inseparable evils, destroy\r\nthe Union. The whole history of mankind warrants such a conclusion. The\r\nevent is certain, but many circumstances lead me to suppose it is yet\r\ndistant, such as the want of entail laws, the extensive franchise, and\r\nthe probability of institutions altering with the progress of the\r\npeople. In the meantime, they have a constitution, “the immediate\r\nadvantages of which are strongly felt, and the evils latent, and\r\ncomparatively remote.”[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Men and Manners in America.\r\n\r\nSeeing no prospect of a steam-boat calling at Sandusky, I hired a horse\r\nin the afternoon of the second day, and rode to the village of Lime,\r\nwhere I obtained a seat in the mail-stage for Detroit.\r\n\r\nArriving at Lime some time before the stage, I walked a short distance\r\nto some people engaged in making cider. The fruit was not crushed, as in\r\nother instances seen in the country, but grated by a revolving cylinder,\r\nwhich seemed to be an improved mode of extracting the juice. The grating\r\napparatus had been manufactured at Rochester, the other parts of the\r\nmachine were erected on the day of my visit by a person in the village;\r\nand it is scarcely possible to conceive any thing more rudely and\r\nill-constructed than they were. On admiring the beauty of the fruit,\r\nwhich was brought forward in waggon loads, Mr Russel, the owner of the\r\norchard from which they came, offered me grafts of any kinds I chose to\r\nfix on. When he learned I was a foreigner on a tour through the country,\r\nhe asked me to look at the orchard, and conducted me to it. He raised\r\nthe trees from seed, and had planted 450 fourteen years ago, twenty-four\r\nfeet asunder, and the branches now interlope. Many of the kinds bore\r\ndelicious fruit, which was generally small in size, from the numbers on\r\nthe tree, and many branches were broken with the weight of fruit. There\r\nseemed a demand for Mr Russel’s cider, which he sold at $1 per barrel,\r\nof thirty-two gallons, when newly expressed, and he was unable to\r\nsatisfy some applications which were made in my presence. The orchards\r\nare numerous in all parts of America, and most of the trees having been\r\nraised from seed, it is probable many excellent varieties may be met\r\nwith deserving of propagation.\r\n\r\nFrom the village of Lime, which is situated on a ridge, by which name it\r\nis sometimes known, a beautiful prairie is seen, and which I believe is\r\nentirely settled. The soil appeared somewhat wet, which ditching would\r\neasily remedy, but this practice seemed altogether disregarded.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Lime, light disappeared, and I was allowed to remain\r\nthree or four hours in a most uncomfortable hotel at Lower Sandusky,\r\nsituated on a river of the same name. When morning dawned, I was\r\ntravelling through a thickly-wooded country, and over a road, on the\r\nsurface of which lime rock was protruding in the manner of honey-comb.\r\nThe coach in which I rode being of a particular construction, the\r\nroughness of the road rendered the journey disagreeable. My progress was\r\nlike a funeral procession, thirty-one miles occupying twelve hours. The\r\njolting of American stages, and more especially when passing over one or\r\ntwo logs lying across the road, is truly annoying, and sometimes\r\ndangerous, from contusions which maybe received, but I had never\r\nexperienced any thing like the motion on the present occasion. For the\r\nfirst time since reaching the American shore, I was slightly afflicted\r\nwith headach, and felt the sensation of fatigue.\r\n\r\nI breakfasted at a log-house on the banks of the river Portage, where I\r\nwas struck with the florid complexion and robust figure of a young man\r\nemployed in cutting pork into small pieces at the door, and which a\r\ngirl, apparently his sister, was salting and packing into a vessel. On\r\napproaching him, I discovered he did not understand the English\r\nlanguage, but one of the inmates of the house acting as interpreter, he\r\ntold me he was from Hanover, and on his way to settle in Michigan.\r\n\r\nI passed through the village of Perrysburg, situated on the south bank\r\nof the river Mamee, which flows into the south-west point of Lake Erie,\r\nand is navigable to the village. It is a thriving place, and when the\r\ncanal, now forming, which is to connect the waters of the Wabash and\r\nMamee is completed, it will soon become a place of importance.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the river, and a little higher up than\r\nPerrysburg, is the village of Mamee, consisting of fifteen or twenty\r\nhouses, where I dined, and arrived at Munroe in the evening. Next day I\r\nreached Detroit, and travelled part of the way with an overgrown man,\r\nwho wore a blue cotton frock-coat above his clothes, and a pair of\r\ndouble-barrelled guns over his shoulders. He spoke the English language\r\nimperfectly, and stated he was from Saxony, and had just settled in\r\nMichigan. His family was at Detroit, and he expected ten thousand of his\r\ncountrymen to join him next season.\r\n\r\nThe soil from Lower Sandusky, on the road by Perrysburg to Michigan\r\nboundary, is not of first-rate quality, though good. The surface is\r\nlevel, and thinly settled. Throughout the whole of my travels in the\r\nstate of Ohio, the country was chiefly forest, and seemingly not more\r\nthan one-sixth of the surface cleared of wood. Perhaps the other lines\r\nof road were still more thinly settled. The state contains above one\r\nmillion of souls.\r\n\r\nThe part of Michigan seen in passing from Mamee to Detroit is thickly\r\nwooded, wet, and very thinly settled. There is no part of the United\r\nStates which disappointed me so much as Michigan. Having passed through\r\nits whole breadth from Detroit to Niles, and along the shores of Lake\r\nErie, and the banks of the river Detroit, I met with more indifferent\r\nsoil in these routes, than in all the other Western States put together.\r\nThere may be much good soil in Michigan, which did not come under my\r\nnotice, but I am quite satisfied its eligibility for settlers has been\r\ngreatly overrated. An inhabitant of New England, who may have resided\r\nall his life on poor soil, thickly covered with forest, can hardly fail\r\nof being pleased with seeing the timbered land and oak-openings of\r\nMichigan, while the small and beautiful prairies will impart ecstasy,\r\nand it is, perhaps, to the accounts of such people that the territory is\r\nindebted for its celebrity. Michigan, compared with the New England\r\nStates, is rich, and a desirable place of settlement, but in all\r\nrespects inferior to districts laying to the south and west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  _Journey from Detroit to New York—Western Lakes which form the River\r\n    St Lawrence—Cleveland—Erie Canal—Cold Weather—Canal Packets—Sabbath\r\n    School Children at Rochester—Black Children—Slavery in the United\r\n    States—Agricultural Notices—Washington Hotel—Transition\r\n    from Rudeness to Refinement—Travelling—Cheap Land—State\r\n    Election—Inhabitants Consulted in Political Matters—Arrival at\r\n    Liverpool._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter spending five days in Upper Canada, it became necessary to wend my\r\nway to New York. The weather for weeks past had been tempestuous. The\r\ntrips of the steam-boats on the lakes had been interrupted, and the\r\nferry-boat at Detroit had, on more than one occasion, ceased to ply from\r\nthe violence of the wind. Had there been a stage through Upper Canada,\r\nfrom Sandwich to Niagara, I would have preferred travelling to New York\r\nby land, but dreading the state of the roads, and length of journey in\r\npassing round the west end of Lake Erie, I decided in going from Detroit\r\nto Buffalo by steam. Vessels were still leaving Detroit for the Western\r\nLakes, notwithstanding the advanced period of the season, and I saw the\r\nMichigan steamer sail for Green Bay, with troops on board.\r\n\r\nLake Superior is the most Westerly and largest of the lakes which divide\r\nUpper Canada from the United States, and the accumulated waters of which\r\nform the river St Lawrence. Its length is about 360 miles, and its\r\naverage breadth 109 miles. The outlet of the lake is the river St Marie,\r\nthrough which the waters flow, and are not navigable for sailing vessels\r\nfrom the strength of current.\r\n\r\nLake Michigan is stated to be 300 miles long, and 50 wide, branching off\r\nfrom the east end of Lake Superior, and their united waters pass into\r\nLake Huron. On the west side of Lake Michigan, is situated the village\r\nof Green Bay and Chicago, to which steam-vessels ply occasionally from\r\nDetroit.\r\n\r\nLake Huron is 218 miles long, by 180 broad, and has several large\r\nbranches running into Michigan and Canada. Michilimackinac, or Mackinaw,\r\nis an island on which there is a village of the same name, at the\r\nentrance of the lake, and Goderich is on the east shore.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the three-mentioned lakes flow through the river St Clair,\r\nand form a lake of the same name, which is about ninety miles in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake St Clair issues the river Detroit, which falls into Lake Erie,\r\nhaving the villages of Detroit, Sandwich, and Amherstburgh, on its\r\nbanks. Lake Erie is stated at 290 miles long, and about 50 broad, and\r\nfrom the many thriving villages on its margins, has a most extensive and\r\nincreasing trade. Its waters are much shallower than those of any of the\r\nother lakes, and more easily agitated, which renders the navigation\r\ndangerous in boisterous weather. From Lake Erie, flows the Niagara, in\r\nthe channel of which are the celebrated falls of the same name, and\r\nempties itself into Lake Ontario, which is 171 miles in length, and 40\r\nwide. The depth of water is said to be very great. On issuing from Lake\r\nOntario, the waters assume the title of the river St Lawrence.\r\n\r\nI sailed from Detroit on the morning of the 25th October, with moderate\r\nwind, which increased towards noon, and the vessel anchored under the\r\nlee of an island in Lake Erie during the night. Next day we put into\r\nCleveland for an hour or two, and reached Buffalo towards the close of\r\nthe third day.\r\n\r\nCleveland is in the state of Ohio, on the banks of Lake Erie, and at the\r\nmouth of the Ohio and Erie canal, which connects the waters of the lake\r\nwith the river Ohio. It is a place of considerable trade, and rising\r\nwith rapidity.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Eagle hotel at Buffalo, I found three or four gentlemen\r\nwho were known to me, and whose conversation on European matters I\r\ngreatly enjoyed after my western tour. Next day, after breakfast, I took\r\na canal-boat for Schenectady.\r\n\r\nIn passing down the canal, on the banks of the Niagara, several new\r\nhouses were erecting on the Canada side, and as they were of large size,\r\nI considered the circumstance evidence of improvement.\r\n\r\nThe Erie canal connects the waters of the river Hudson with that of Lake\r\nErie. It commences at Albany, and terminates at Buffalo, the length\r\nbeing 363 miles. Besides the main cut, there are lateral branches\r\nintersecting the country in all directions. One branch communicates with\r\nLake Ontario at the village of Oswego, and I believe another branch is\r\nin progress to communicate with one of the tributary streams of the\r\nriver Ohio. The height of Lake Erie above the Hudson is 568 feet, and\r\nthe lockage of the canal 688 feet. The breadth of the canal is forty\r\nfeet at the top, twenty-eight at the bottom, and the depth of water four\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Erie canal was formed by the State of New York, the operations\r\ncommencing in 1817, and ending in 1825. The revenues of the canal are so\r\nample, that the rates of charge were greatly reduced in 1833, and it is\r\nexpected the whole debt will be discharged in 1838; after which, the\r\ncharges will be diminished, so as the sum collected may be just\r\nsufficient to keep the works in repair. The canal is therefore like a\r\npublic highway, from which no revenue will be exacted from the\r\ninhabitants, and is an instance of the advantages they enjoy from the\r\nwisdom with which public matters are conducted.\r\n\r\nThe traffic on the canal is already so extensive, that the barges are\r\nsometimes detained a long time in passing the locks. In all probability\r\nit will be quite unable to convey the traffic in two years hence,\r\nalthough a double set of locks were to be constructed throughout the\r\nwhole length of the canal. The enterprise of the inhabitants of this\r\nState is adequate to any emergency, and relief to the crowded canal will\r\nbe found in a railway. There is already a railway from Albany to\r\nSchenectady, and in 1833 a railway was contracted for to proceed from\r\nthe latter place to Utica, all of which are situated on the banks of the\r\ncanal. A railway may therefore be said to be already formed on the banks\r\nof the canal one-third of its length; and there is little doubt of its\r\nbeing speedily extended all the way to Buffalo, and ultimately along\r\nLake Erie into Illinois. However advantageous canals may have hitherto\r\nbeen found in the United States, such a conveyance is incompatible with\r\nthe order of things that is arising. The population is advancing so\r\nrapidly towards the west, that the intercourse between the Eastern and\r\nWestern States must enormously encrease, while canals are shut by ice\r\nfor nearly five months in the year. In this view railways, which afford\r\ncommunication during the whole season, will be had recourse to, and are\r\nadmirably adapted to the country and climate. There is abundance of iron\r\nand coal in the United States, and the substitution of railways for\r\ncanals will be aided by the rapidity of conveyance, the application of\r\nsteam power, and unobstruction from frost.\r\n\r\nWhile passing down the canal, the temperature of the atmosphere became\r\ncold; on the third morning, snow covered the ground to the depth of\r\nthree inches, which did not entirely melt by the influence of the sun;\r\nand although the canal was not frozen, in consequence of its waters\r\nbeing kept in motion by the incessant traffic, the pools on the banks\r\nwere covered with ice several inches thick. On reaching Albany, I\r\nlearned Fahrenheit’s thermometer had stood twelve degrees below the\r\nfreezing point on the 29th October, and at New York ten degrees.\r\n\r\nThe canal packets were crowded with passengers all the way from Buffalo\r\nto Schenectady, who made themselves agreeable to each other, and time\r\npassed as pleasantly as the nature of things would admit. Two of the\r\ngentlemen on board seemed to be clergymen, with whom I conversed a great\r\ndeal, and was invited to spend some days with one of them. Few things in\r\nAmerica seem more extraordinary than the sleeping accommodation of the\r\npackets. The seats on which the passengers sit during day, around the\r\nsides of the vessel, open out by means of hinges, and having the outer\r\nextremities supported by small ropes from the roof, form beds. A second\r\ntier of beds is formed by frames hooking to the sides of the vessel, and\r\nsupported from the roof by ropes. The sleeping place for the ladies is\r\nseparated from the gentlemen’s by a curtain, and the two rows of beds\r\naround the sides of the packet have a close resemblance to shelves in a\r\nBritish shop. The passengers are sent on the roof of the packet while\r\nthe cabin is altering from sitting to sleeping-trim, which does not\r\noccupy more than ten minutes, and the passengers, suspended in rows when\r\nin bed, look like strings of onions in a green-grocer’s shop. The eating\r\ndepartment was tolerably well managed.\r\n\r\nThere was a changing of packets three times in the length of the canal,\r\nand a delay of twelve hours at Rochester; during which I stopt at the\r\nEagle hotel. When standing at the door of the hotel, after breakfast, my\r\nattention was attracted to a number of children walking in pairs along\r\nthe pavement, attended by a few grown-up people, and on enquiry I\r\nlearned they were proceeding to church, to the anniversary meeting of\r\nthe Sabbath schools. After many hundreds of both sexes had passed,\r\nattended by their teachers, I observed four black children forming the\r\nrear of a school division; and being anxious to see so interesting a\r\nsight as the assembled children, I followed the little blackamoors.\r\nKnowing the prejudice which white people have to the coloured race in\r\nalmost every part of the world, I was disappointed at seeing the four\r\nblack children separate from the others, and instead of entering the\r\nchurch they were conducted round the corner of a street into a building\r\nwithin a court. I still followed the blacks, but seeing none of the\r\npeople entering the place where they were, I walked to and fro on the\r\noutside. At the end of two minutes, about twenty black children came out\r\nof the building, attended by five or six white men, and walked into the\r\nchurch amongst the rest of the children. I occupied a place in the\r\ngallery, and listened to a very commonplace address to the children, and\r\nthe meeting separated without religious exercises of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe want of religious exercise appeared to me to arise from a desire of\r\npreventing any feeling of jealousy amongst sects regarding minute\r\ndifferences in forms of worship and creeds of faith; and if such was the\r\ncase, the inhabitants of other countries would do well to imitate this\r\nconciliatory proceeding. I did not observe, after getting into church,\r\nif the black children were kept separate from the white; but the fact of\r\nthis hitherto despised race attending Sabbath schools with white\r\nchildren, and being taught by white people, in the town of Rochester,\r\nwas placed beyond doubt, and gave rise to pleasing anticipations for the\r\nimprovement of their condition.\r\n\r\nSlavery excites much interest in America, as well as in Britain, and is\r\nso repugnant to my feelings, that before setting out on my Transatlantic\r\ntour, I determined not to penetrate into the slave-holding states.\r\nDuring my short excursion into Missouri, extending to about fifty miles,\r\nand stay at St Charles, St Louis, and Louisville, occupying four days, I\r\nhad little opportunity of judging of the effects of slavery on the white\r\npopulation, or of the state of the slaves themselves. I must, however,\r\nsay, no instance of cruelty or harshness towards the black population\r\ncame under my notice, and all of them appeared to be well clothed and\r\nfed. Slavery, as existing in the United States, seems not to be well\r\nunderstood in Britain; and I regret it is not in my power to communicate\r\nmore information on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe United States were originally English colonies, and they inherited\r\nslavery from the mother country. This foul stain on their character may\r\nin fairness be attributed to Britain, and accounted one of the curses\r\nwith which her misguided rulers have afflicted mankind. In 1703, the\r\ncolony of Massachusetts endeavoured to restrain the introduction of\r\nslaves, by the imposition of a tax, and to prevent it altogether in\r\n1767. The colony of Virginia, in 1772, petitioned the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain on the subject, without obtaining redress, and other\r\ncolonies remonstrated at different times. In 1780, the state of\r\nPennsylvania, while engaged in struggling for independence, passed an\r\nact for gradually emancipating the slaves; and since that time, eight\r\nout of the thirteen original colonies have abolished slavery.\r\n\r\nThe United States are composed of twenty-four distinct countries, each\r\nhaving a different republican form of government, and the power of\r\nmanaging its own affairs—the general government legislating only in\r\nmatters connected with defence, commerce, and taxation. At the time of\r\nthe United States rising into existence, slavery engaged the attention\r\nof the legislature, but the evil had already spread thickly over the\r\nSouthern States, and the feelings and habits of the white population in\r\nthis part of the territory being strongly in its favour, a separation\r\nand weakening of the Union would have resulted from then pressing the\r\nsubject. It is a disputed point whether the general government can\r\ninterfere with slavery—the Northern and Southern States taking different\r\nviews. A law was passed prohibiting slavery in the district north of the\r\nriver Ohio, and east of the Mississippi, before the territory was\r\norganized into states; but since that time, the state of Missouri, with\r\nall the evils of slavery, has been admitted into the bosom of the Union,\r\nwhich seems to determine the noninterference of the general government\r\nin the slave question.\r\n\r\nSlavery is felt and acknowledged to be an appalling evil throughout the\r\nUnion, and the most intelligent inhabitants of the Northern States are\r\nalso aware of its sinfulness. Here the prejudice against the sooty race\r\nis becoming less strong; and in one instance, at least, they have been\r\ninvested with the rights of freemen. In the state of New York, men of\r\ncolour exercise suffrage when twenty-one years of age, and the census of\r\n1825 showed 298 of them qualified to vote.[4] This act of wisdom and\r\nliberality on the part of the legislature, cannot fail of producing a\r\ngood effect throughout the Union, and in all probability led to the\r\nteaching of the little children at Rochester already mentioned. I hail\r\nthese advances of the coloured population with unmingled pleasure, as\r\nsure indications of improvement in the people of both complexions.\r\nSlavery exists by the cupidity of the white population; and in most\r\ncases it will terminate only by their moral enlightenment. However slow\r\nthe progress of abolition may be in the United States, it cannot stand\r\nstill. Justice, humanity, and religion are already enlisted on the side\r\nof the slave; and before the lapse of many years, his manacles will\r\nassuredly be loosened throughout the whole territory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Description of United States; published at New York, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe world does not perhaps afford a more striking instance of human\r\nfrailty, than the existence of slavery in the Southern States of the\r\nUnion, where the white population, after having avowedly established\r\ngovernments in opposition to tyranny, and on the principle that all men\r\nare equal, continue to exercise the most inhuman oppression towards\r\ntheir coloured fellow-creatures, who are treated like the brute\r\ncreation. This anomaly illustrates how much man is the creature of\r\ncircumstances; and that with all his boasted powers of intellect, he is\r\nunable to conquer the habits and prejudices of his youth, even when his\r\nconduct is at variance with reason, and the principles of the religion\r\nhe professes to follow. Whether the slave-owner, who has been instructed\r\namidst slavery, and whose moral perception has been blunted by\r\neducation, be answerable for all the enormities which result from the\r\nsystem, may be left for casuists to determine; but those who have been\r\nmore fortunately situated may well commiserate his fate, and judge\r\ncharitably of his errors.\r\n\r\nHowever instrumental, under Providence, the people of Britain may have\r\nbeen in obtaining freedom for the West Indian slave, they would do well\r\nto reflect on the slow progress the question made amongst themselves,\r\nand that many of their own countrymen connected with the colonies were\r\nopposed to the measure of relief. If, having lived apart from slavery,\r\nand its demoralizing effects, they claim merit for their exertions in\r\nbehalf of the slave, let them not withhold what is due to the\r\ninhabitants of the States, who, while living amidst slaves, set an\r\nexample of emancipation which has not yet been carried to the same\r\nextent in any British possession.\r\n\r\nSome recent British travellers in America, in pandering to the depraved\r\ntaste of a portion of their countrymen, will not allow merit to the\r\nstates who have emancipated their slaves, on the ground that they did so\r\nonly when slave labour ceased to be profitable, and that the step\r\ninvolved no sacrifice, as the able-bodied slaves were sold to the\r\ninhabitants of other states—the aged and infirm being alone set free.\r\nThis is a most uncharitable judgment. I have not the means of\r\nascertaining the number of slaves that were emancipated, but contend\r\nthat other motives than selfishness must pervade some of the inhabitants\r\nof New York state, where the coloured population are invested with\r\nsuffrages, and taught at Sabbath schools with white children. It is\r\ntrue, however, the negro race is the subject of deep-rooted prejudice,\r\nand the slave of opinion; but in what portion of the globe, inhabited by\r\nwhite people, is not this the case?\r\n\r\nThere are many pretended philanthropists in Britain, who feel keenly for\r\nthe sufferings of the coloured people in distant countries, and do not\r\nsympathize with the unfortunate beings of their own complexion at home,\r\nwho proclaim to the world the sinfulness of slavery, and yet strain\r\nevery nerve to retain the unjust fetters of their own countrymen, and\r\nwho lament the negro being an object of prejudice in the United States,\r\nwhile they regard most of the white people around them with the same\r\nfeeling. In America, the inhabitants of the Southern States talk of the\r\ntyranny of Europe and the degraded population of Ireland, while the\r\nsound of the lash, and the moanings of their own suffering slaves, ring\r\nin their ears; and in Britain, the cruelty of the American slaveholder,\r\nand the injuries of his oppressed slave, are descanted on by people who\r\nactively engage in withholding just rights from the lower orders of\r\ntheir own countrymen, and remain insensible to their base condition.\r\nSuch is the shortsightedness and inconsistency of man over the world. At\r\na distance, he sees oppression in others, and sympathizes with its\r\nvictim, while insensible to his own tyranny and its effects at home.\r\nAlmost all the evils which afflict humanity, originate from the passions\r\nof man. Slavery in the United States, and the degradation of the Irish\r\npeasantry, sprung from the same source—the aristocratic feeling of the\r\npeople of England.\r\n\r\nOn the packet reaching Shenectady, a stage-coach was on the banks of the\r\ncanal waiting our arrival, into which I stepped, and soon afterwards\r\nfound myself in Albany. My first proceeding was to obtain a new hat, and\r\nafter dinner I waited on Mr Buel.\r\n\r\nFrom some paragraphs I had read in newspapers while in Ohio, I learned\r\nan agricultural exhibition was to have taken place about this time at\r\nAlbany, at which I was anxious to be present. It had, however, been held\r\ntwo days before my arrival, and I learned from Mr Buel it had not\r\naltogether come up to his expectation. A certain time must elapse before\r\nthe public acquire a taste for such things, and I have no doubt Albany\r\nwill, in this respect, set an example to other places in the States. I\r\nhad carried from Britain a few copies of the Agricultural Exhibition at\r\nStirling, by Messrs Drummonds, which I left with some of my friends in\r\nthe United States, and doubt not they will find them useful.\r\n\r\nFrom Buffalo to Albany, by way of the canal, there is a good deal of\r\nfine land, and much of the foliage having dropt from the trees, afforded\r\nan opportunity of seeing the country. Indian corn was frequently seen on\r\nthe ground, though in some instances the ears had been plucked from the\r\nstanding stalks, and I was particularly struck with the puny appearance\r\nof the crops, compared with those of Illinois. Pumpkins seemed to have\r\nbeen frequently grown amongst Indian corn, and farmers generally engaged\r\nin carrying them home. This vegetable is given to oxen and cows. In most\r\ninstances the wheat crop was above ground. Before reaching Utica, I\r\nobserved a drain forming, at no great distance from the canal, which was\r\nthe only attempt of the kind I saw executing on the American territory.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after my arrival at Albany, I set out for New York, and\r\nthe day being particularly fine, I enjoyed the sail down the river. The\r\ntrees presented a diversity of appearance, some being without a leaf,\r\nand others in all the freshness of spring. The blue rocks were seen\r\nbehind the fading foliage, a bright sun added to the brilliancy of the\r\nautumnal tints, and rendered the scenery more beautiful than I thought\r\nit when seen before in the early part of June.\r\n\r\nOn reaching New York, about eight in the evening, I bent my steps\r\ntowards the Washington hotel in Broadway, and found my trunks and keys\r\nwere in the possession of the landlord, Mr Ward. After having seen some\r\nof the most celebrated hotels in the States, such as the Tremont at\r\nBoston, and Mr Head’s at Philadelphia, none of them pleased me so much\r\nas the Washington hotel. No individual could be more civil,\r\naccommodating, and attentive, than Mr Ward, and all the arrangements of\r\nthe house seemed to me extremely judicious. The tables were at all times\r\nserved with the best of fare; the hours were kept with punctuality, and\r\nthe waiters numerous and active. I cannot speak of the accommodation for\r\npeople who have private parlours. Ladies never appear at the public\r\ntable of the Washington hotel, although many of them have private rooms\r\nin it. The traveller who dislikes the Washington hotel is more likely to\r\nfind the cause of his dissatisfaction in himself than in the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I ascertained my trunks were in possession of Mr Ward, I\r\nproceeded to call on Captain Smith of the Napoleon, who was to sail in a\r\nfew days for Liverpool, and from whom I secured a berth. I was still in\r\nmy travelling garb, my tattered garments being concealed by “Mrs\r\nTrollope.” Captain Smith, in the warmth of his greeting, hurried me into\r\nhis parlour before I had time to explain my situation; and never shall I\r\nforget my feelings on again finding myself seated on a luxurious sofa in\r\na fashionable room. Since leaving Montreal on the 18th August, I had not\r\nseen a sofa, or a chair with a stuffed bottom, except one at York, nor a\r\nwindow-curtain, or carpet. The walls of the rooms did not support a\r\npainting or print of any description, and in all domestic arrangements\r\nthere was a total absence of the elegances of life. I had become so much\r\nhabituated to the state of things around me, that for the remainder of\r\nmy days I would have been satisfied with bare walls and wooden-bottomed\r\nchairs, and regarded the gewgaws of refined society with contempt. It is\r\nnot likely the impressions of my Backwood tour will be altogether\r\neffaced while the pulse of life beats true. I confess, however, the\r\nfacility with which I adopted the refinements of New York, and the\r\nenjoyment they afforded, seemed to arise from something else than mere\r\nnovelty. The venison at the table of the Washington hotel, served on\r\nplates with a flaming spirit-lamp underneath, appeared more palatable\r\nthan the coagulating fried pork of Canada, and my head seemed higher\r\nthan it had been for ten weeks before, from being surrounded with a\r\ncollar of velvet instead of rags. Man may often learn humility from his\r\nown inconsistency and folly. I felt ashamed of my weakness.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival at New York, I retired to bed. Next morning my\r\ntrunks were ransacked, and I was mortified at finding I had outgrown my\r\nwearing apparel. Travelling may at all times be regarded as conducive to\r\nhealth, by affording mental and bodily exercise, apart from worldly\r\ncares, and more especially under the circumstances I was situated,\r\nhaving had choice of time, route, and distance, without incumbrance of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\nFor weeks together I seldom entered a house which was not the scene of\r\nhuman suffering. Associating with disease and pestilence, I conversed at\r\nthe bedside of the fever patient, and rubbed the muscles of the victim\r\nof cholera. I had been exposed to the effects of solar heat, night-damp,\r\nrain, cold, hunger, and fatigue. Few people perhaps ever enjoyed so\r\nlarge a measure of health as fell to my lot during my wanderings in the\r\nwestern parts of inhabited America, and at no period of life did I\r\npossess so much mental and bodily vigour. While I gratefully acknowledge\r\nmy health and strength to have emanated from divine agency, I may state\r\nmy habits were strictly temperate, having denied myself every liquid but\r\nwater and tea. The trammels of society prevented me trying the effects\r\nof absolute temperance at an earlier period. They exceeded my\r\nexpectations, and from experience, I recommend temperance to all who\r\nwish to enjoy life.\r\n\r\nOn the second day after my arrival at New York, I attended a sale of\r\nland by auction, which I had observed advertised. An estate fifty miles\r\nfrom Albany, sold at about 7s. 6d. sterling per acre. Another, situated\r\nin St Lawrence county, state of New York, consisting of 25,000 acres,\r\nwas knocked down, in one lot, at 1s. 1½d. sterling per acre.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, there was an election of members of Senate for the\r\nstate. The legislature of the state of New York consists of a Senate and\r\nAssembly. The Senate contains thirty-two members, who are elected for\r\nfour years, and vacate their seats by rotation, one-fourth yearly. The\r\nright of suffrage belongs to every white male citizen, who has attained\r\n21 years of age, and who has resided six months in the state, and paid\r\ntaxes. Men of colour are allowed to vote if they are 21 years of age,\r\nand have been citizens of the state three years, and possess a clear\r\nfreehold of $250.\r\n\r\nOn getting into the street after breakfast, I did not see any thing\r\nindicating an election, the people seemed going about in their ordinary\r\nway. There was not a crowd, or idler of any kind on the outside of the\r\nballot-rooms, and on entering one of them, I found nine or ten people\r\ninside. There were two printed ballot tickets, containing a different\r\nlist of candidates, and which were supplied by individuals near the\r\ndoor. The voters, on entering the room, were offered tickets, which they\r\nhanded to people on the opposite side of a counter, appointed to receive\r\nthem, and who dropt them into a box. The voter was asked his name and\r\nplace of residence, and immediately retired. The business excited little\r\ninterest, the voters almost never reading any part of the ticket handed\r\nthem, and the secretaries seldom referring to the lists for the identity\r\nof the voter. I also entered a ballot-room in the suburbs. Here a good\r\nmany vehicles were standing around the door, and the interior, which\r\nseemed the bar-room of a hotel, was filled with men who had evidently\r\nbeen drinking spirits. Printed tickets were also here received and\r\ndelivered, as already described. Individuals may prepare tickets for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the election of members of Senate, there was a ballot for\r\nreducing the duty on salt, which the following circular, copied from a\r\nnewspaper of the day, will explain. “_To the Public._ After a most\r\nthorough examination of the subject, and a full conviction of the\r\ninjustice and partial operation of the existing tax on salt of domestic\r\nmanufacture, the Legislature of this State, at their three last\r\nsessions, successively passed resolutions for an amendment of the\r\nConstitution, by which they would be enabled to reduce that tax or duty\r\nfrom twelve-and-a-half to six cents per bushel. Those resolutions are\r\nnow submitted to the people for their approval, and are dependent for\r\nultimate success on the votes that may be given in their favour at the\r\napproaching annual election.\r\n\r\n“The words of the amendment are, ‘That the duties on the manufacture of\r\nsalt, as established by the act of the fifteenth of April, one thousand\r\neight hundred and seventeen, and by the section of the seventh article\r\nof the Constitution of the State, may at any time hereafter be reduced,\r\nby act of the Legislature of this State, but shall not, while the same\r\nis appropriated and pledged by said section, be reduced below the sum of\r\nsix cents upon each and every bushel, and the said duties shall remain\r\ninviolably appropriated and applied as is provided by the said tenth\r\nsection; and that so much of said tenth section of the seventh article\r\nof the constitution of this state, as is inconsistent with this\r\namendment, be destroyed.’\r\n\r\n“At a meeting, called for the purpose of considering and deciding upon\r\nsuch measures as might be deemed most proper for the occasion, the\r\nundersigned were appointed as a committee to correspond with their\r\nfellow-citizens in the different parts of the States and to take such\r\nsteps to secure a favourable result in regard to the proposed amendment,\r\nas in their opinion circumstances should require. They, accordingly, ask\r\npermission to state some of the many important considerations which have\r\na bearing on the question, and which, they trust, will satisfy every\r\nperson, as they have the Legislature, of the propriety and obvious\r\nnecessity of the intended alteration.\r\n\r\n“The present duty, or more properly excise, is excessively\r\ndisproportioned to the value of the salt at the works, varying from 100\r\nto 200 per cent, and obliging the purchaser, when he sells at retail to\r\nthe consumer, to charge an advance of profit on _this_ as well as on the\r\nnet cost. And the consequence is, that a bushel of salt, at the present\r\ntime worth about twelve and a half cents at the works, must have the\r\nduty of twelve and a half cents and the profit of the dealer added, and\r\naltogether make the cost to the distant consumer, (independent of bills\r\nand transportation,) from twelve to fifteen shillings per barrel,\r\none-half of which, and sometimes three-fourths, arising from the duty\r\nexclusively, will be in a ratio corresponding with any reduction that\r\nmay be made in the duty. Now, the reduction anticipated by the amendment\r\nwill make a saving to the consumer of six to ten cents on the bushel, or\r\n30 to 50 cents on the barrel, and to the state at large, exclusive of\r\nthe extra price for foreign salt, an aggregate of $200,000 per annum;\r\nand farther, both the manufacturer and the dealer will be relieved in\r\npart, from an onerous and troublesome exaction.\r\n\r\n“As a source of revenue, the following brief _exposé_ will exhibit the\r\nglaring impolicy and sinister effect of the duty. Suppose that the\r\nquantity manufactured this year is 2,000,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n “The duty at 12½ cents would be                                $250,000\r\n                                                                ————————\r\n “Less—interest on the amount expended for the pumps, with\r\n   their necessary repairs and engineer’s salary, over and\r\n   above the sum received for pumping, say                         5,000\r\n\r\n “Superintendents’, commissioners’, inspectors’ fees, and the\r\n   office, with other charges,                                    10,000\r\n                                                                ————————\r\n                                                                  15,000\r\n                                                                ————————\r\n “Balance to be paid into canal fund,                           $235,000\r\n                                                                ========\r\n\r\n “Suppose, again, that 1,500,000 bushels are annually consumed\r\n   within this state, the duty would be                         $187,500\r\n\r\n “The dealer’s profit (to cover losses, &c.) will be 25 per\r\n   cent,                                                          46,875\r\n                                                                ————————\r\n “Amount paid on _domestic salt_ by the consumers within the\r\n   state,                                                        234,375\r\n\r\n “The consumers of _foreign salt_ within the state owing to\r\n   this duty, are compelled annually to pay an extra price for\r\n   that article, in the above proportion, and on 1,000,000\r\n   bushels, of 56 lb. each (the lowest quantity at which it can\r\n   be estimated) is                                              156,250\r\n                                                                ————————\r\n                                                                $390,625\r\n\r\n“Thus the $234,375 paid into the canal fund, costs the people, and they\r\nare principally the farmers and the labouring classes, $390,625, or, in\r\nother words, they pay directly and indirectly more than two dollars for\r\nevery _one_ dollar that that fund receives from the duty—a fund, too,\r\nthat does not need it, as may be seen by the report of Mr Stilwell to\r\nthe Assembly in 1833, No. 268. If, instead of an insidious impost, the\r\nsum received into that fund were even paid by a _direct tax_, the cost\r\nto the consumers would not be one-fourth the amount that is now drawn\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n“It can be satisfactorily shown, should the object in view be attained,\r\nthat the immediate extension of the markets to vast districts of\r\ncountry, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, the Canadas, and\r\nsome of the Eastern States, which have hitherto drawn their supplies\r\nfrom other sources, and the consequent enlargement of the manufacture,\r\nupon which about one-half of the duty would continue to be paid, with a\r\ngreat and certain increase of canal tolls, will preserve the canal fund\r\nundiminished, and probably exceed at once the sum that would be obtained\r\nby a continuance of the duty at its present high rate.\r\n\r\n“The salt-springs, judging from the consumption of brine for the last\r\ntwo years, each of which require from ninety to one hundred millions of\r\ngallons, and produced about 2,000,000 bushels of salt, without any\r\nperceptible diminution, appear as inexhaustible as the Onondaga lake\r\nitself. And we may, of course, confidently assume, as the state\r\npossesses unlimited control, that there can be no monopoly, and that an\r\nincrease in the quantity made will establish a steady supply at the\r\nlowest prices, and be a security against any sudden and extravagant\r\nrise, which would otherwise certainly happen in the event of a war, or\r\ninterruption of our intercourse with other nations.\r\n\r\n“The subscribers would present herewith other statements and\r\ncalculations, but for their great length, and a desire to avoid\r\nprolixity, which have appeared upon this question in the several reports\r\nto the Legislature, especially that of Mr Throop, made to the senate in\r\n1831, No 56, and which most fully sustain these representations. The\r\ncommittee rely on the aid of the people at large for the accomplishment\r\nof the object in view; and in order that you may be prepared to\r\ncooperate with them, send a quantity of ballots, to the distribution of\r\nwhich at the polls, to be held in November next, they solicit your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“The following is the form of the ballot which the law prescribes for\r\nthose in favour of the proposed amendment. ‘For authorizing the\r\nLegislature to reduce the duties on salt.’”\r\n\r\nI rode with a gentleman in his gig to a ballot-room in the suburbs of\r\nNew York, and saw him vote for continuing the duties on salt. An immense\r\nmajority, however, of the inhabitants were in favour of reducing the\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nTo the people of Britain it may appear somewhat strange, that the\r\ninhabitants of a country should be consulted on a political question,\r\nits supporters and opponents being ascertained by ballot, and the\r\ncircumstance of universal suffrage and annual parliaments prevailing in\r\nthe state of New York, will heighten the feeling. The followers of\r\naristocracy may denounce the proceeding, and proclaim the people\r\nincapable of judging political matters, which are alone comprehensible\r\nto nobility. But whatever peculiarities may exist in Britain, experience\r\nin America has demonstrated that the powers of human intellect do not,\r\nin any degree, depend on hereditary title, texture of garment, or weight\r\nof purse; and that all matters connected with the domestic policy of a\r\nstate, may be made comprehensible, and intrusted to its inhabitants. The\r\nintricacy of legislation has long been a favourite theme with the _few_\r\nwho rule the _many_. But whatever may be the state of enlightenment\r\nregarding legislation, the people of every civilized country must be as\r\ncompetent to understand it as their rulers are, both parties having the\r\nsame common sense, and against the dictates of which law-making should\r\nnot even be attempted. Whatever is clearly understood by men in power,\r\nmay be made manifest to the people, and safely left to their decision;\r\nand when such men wish to adopt measures without seeing their way, the\r\npeople ought also to be consulted, both with a view of obtaining\r\ninstruction and lessening the responsibility and odium of failure. These\r\nremarks are borne out by the proceedings of the state of New York\r\nregarding the salt question.\r\n\r\nNobility and mobility, or by whatever names the aristocracy and people\r\ncan be distinguished, may each have their advocates; but the propriety\r\nof placing political power in either, must be decided by the effects\r\nproduced. In measures connected with public interest, the state of New\r\nYork is not surpassed, and perhaps not equalled, by any district on\r\nearth, and all of them originated from, and exist by, the power and\r\nconsent of the people. How different is the state of things in Britain,\r\nwhere the people have hitherto had almost no voice in political matters.\r\nIf the legislation of Britain was to be regulated by collecting the\r\nopinions of the people by ballot, many important changes would soon take\r\nplace. There is, however, much difference between the people of America\r\nand those of Britain. In the latter, a considerable portion of the\r\npopulation has been so debased by the effects of aristocracy, that they\r\nare ill qualified for discharging political duties. This is not,\r\nhowever, a just reason for withholding rights from any portion of the\r\ncommunity entitled to them; and should excess arise amongst the people\r\nin obtaining or exercising their rights, the aristocracy who have\r\nneglected and degraded them, may be considered its real authors.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving New York, it became necessary to change my American money\r\ninto that of England, which was easily effected. The chief currency of\r\nthe United States is paper, and consists of one dollar bills and\r\nupwards. The currency passing at par in one state, is often at a\r\ndiscount in the adjoining one; and as the value of almost the whole\r\npaper currency is published weekly in the newspapers, little loss need\r\narise. Travellers often complain of loss sustained on paper money in\r\npassing from one part of the country to another. I supplied myself with\r\nlarge dollar bills of the United States Bank, which passes current\r\nthroughout the Union, and on changing which, the hotel keepers and\r\ncoach-office keepers asked me the direction I meant to travel, and gave\r\nme silver coin, or such provincial bills as they knew would pass at par.\r\nThroughout my whole tour, I did not lose a cent by depreciated paper\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the coldness of the weather in the end of October,\r\nNovember commenced most favourably, being calm, with bright sunshine.\r\nThe ladies thronged the streets of New York in summer attire; and in\r\nsome cases fires were dispensed with. In several little excursions made\r\nin the vicinity of the town, I remarked the graceful weeping willow\r\nstill in fresh and full leaf on the 7th November, although the\r\nthermometer a week before had stood at ten degrees below the freezing\r\npoint; and a branch of considerable length which I pulled and brought to\r\nScotland, still retains the leaves.\r\n\r\nI left New York in the Napoleon on the 8th November. The vessel was\r\ntowed by a steamer until reaching the Narrows; the day was delightful,\r\nand looked and felt like what has often been described as Indian summer.\r\nOn the second day of the voyage the wind blew strong, and sometimes\r\nafterwards tempestuously. The passengers were most agreeable people, but\r\nsea-sickness prevented my enjoying their company; and we arrived at\r\nLiverpool in sixteen days from the time of leaving New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 A VIEW\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                       CANADAS AND UNITED STATES,\r\n                                   AS\r\n                  ADAPTED FOR AGRICULTURAL EMIGRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   TO\r\n\r\n                        CHARLES HAGART SHIRREFF,\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n\r\n            FOLLOWING VIEW OF THE CANADAS AND UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n                              IS INSCRIBED\r\n\r\n                                   BY\r\n\r\n                              HIS BROTHER,\r\n\r\n                              THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  _System of Nature Reproductive and Progressive, when aided by Man—Soil\r\n    is a Workshop—Nature and Man manufacturing Produce—East Lothian\r\n    Agriculture—Corn Laws—Leases—Competition for Land—Situation of\r\n    Tenants—Situation of Hinds—Prospects of the People connected with\r\n    Land._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whatever sources arise the materials which compose and sustain\r\norganized bodies, no symptoms of decline can be discovered in them.\r\nNature seems to be a system of continued reproduction, and, when aided\r\nby man, of progressive increase.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of matter which has been organized since the beginning of\r\ntime must be immense. But whether the world is viewed in whole or in\r\nportions, nature has no appearance of decay, but seems a manufactory\r\nproducing new fabrics, which are again reduced to their elements, in\r\nendless succession. Generation succeeds generation, and year after year\r\nfurnishes sustenance. In the operations of nature there is no loss of\r\nmaterials—and when they are aided by human industry, she generously\r\nrewards man with an increase of her returns, and continues to reproduce\r\nthe increase. The bounties of nature seem inexhaustible, and, in some\r\nmeasure, proportioned to man’s industry.\r\n\r\nThe system of nature, such as I have ventured to describe, may be\r\nillustrated by the details of the farm. Pastures which have continued\r\nunder the influence of nature, annually yield herbage without decrease.\r\nWhen they are stocked with sheep, man is rewarded with the increase of\r\nthe animals, and the herbage is reproduced as before. If the pasturage\r\nis improved by draining and top-dressing, there will be an increase in\r\nthe returns from sheep, and the improvement in the pasturage continues\r\nfrom year to year. When an improvement in the sheep is effected, there\r\nwill be an additional return from them, which, by continued attention,\r\nbecomes permanent.\r\n\r\nWhen pasturage is superseded by grains and roots, their increased\r\nreturns above pasturage is the reward of cultivation; and drainage,\r\nmanures, and labours greatly increase the returns. In such a system of\r\nfarming man acts a prominent part with nature, and skilful industry is\r\nrequired to continue the increase. Without skill and industry the\r\nreturns from cultivation yearly diminish, and ultimately fall short of\r\nthose from pasturage or undisturbed nature. In this case it is not\r\nnature but man which fails to do his part, and the decrease may be\r\nconsidered a just retribution.\r\n\r\nA reflecting mind will discover much evidence of nature’s economy\r\nthroughout the universe—and the farm supplies familiar illustrations.\r\nCows and sheep by consuming grass, yield butcher meat, milk, butter,\r\ncheese, and leather. These varied fabrics emanate from the same source,\r\nand when reduced to their elements, may again enter into the composition\r\nof grass. The straw of grain crops and other vegetable matter, after\r\nbeing eaten by or trampled under the feet of animals, decomposes and\r\nenters into wheat, barley, and turnip, or any other plant. In this\r\nmanner the vegetable and animal kingdoms assist each other, and so\r\nperfect is the economy of nature, that none of her materials are lost in\r\nthe intercourse.\r\n\r\nBy judicious management the fertility of a farm may be maintained, or\r\nits productions reproduced year after year; the produce usually disposed\r\nof being the reward of cultivation. If such produce was to be consumed\r\non the farm, its fertility would be augmented, and the reproductive and\r\nprogressive increase of nature, when assisted by man, exemplified. But\r\nthe progression in fertility is checked by excessive luxuriance, which\r\ndiminishes the returns. Thus lavish and niggardly cultivation are both\r\npunished, and illustrative of the maxim, to use the things of this life\r\nwithout abusing them.\r\n\r\nMan seems to have been endowed with rational powers for supplying\r\nhimself with the means of subsistence, which he accomplishes chiefly\r\nthrough the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Vegetables directly minister\r\nto his wants in various ways, and indirectly through domestic animals,\r\nwhich are altogether dependent on them. The farm illustrates the direct\r\nsupply in the production of wheat, potatoes, and flax, the indirect\r\nsupply, in butcher meat and wool. In farm economy, vegetables and\r\nanimals may be viewed as manufacturing machines, assisting man and each\r\nother, and the united results of which are necessary to the formation of\r\ncertain fabrics, such as milk. From this source man is supplied with\r\nmany of the luxuries as well as the necessaries of life. The results of\r\nthe mulberry-tree, silk-worm, and cochineal insect, are united in some\r\nof the lustrous clothing of the fair sex.\r\n\r\nThe materials entering into organized life may be varied, and partly\r\nunknown to man. The most important elements of them, however, are to be\r\nfound in air and water, and may, therefore, be said to pervade the\r\nuniverse. Should a difference of opinion exist regarding them, it is\r\nencouraging for the farmer to know that they abound every where within\r\nthe sphere of his operations.\r\n\r\nThe localities for manufacturing sustenance are almost as varied as the\r\nmachinery or plants. The sea, air, and exterior of every organized body\r\nare stations, but the surface of the earth or soil is the chief. The\r\nlocalities may be considered workshops, differing in merit, without\r\ngenerally contributing materials towards the manufactures. Sustenance\r\nmanufactured in the sea and on the surface of the earth, equally sustain\r\nhuman life, and contain the same elements.\r\n\r\nSoil is not often regarded simply as a workshop, although no other view\r\nof it accords with the operations of nature and of man. It does not in\r\nany case appear to contribute materially to the formation of plants, and\r\nis only useful to them by affording support to their roots, and holding\r\ntheir sustenance, being a receptacle of air, water, decomposing\r\norganized bodies, and mineral substances. Soil may be rendered fertile\r\nor unfertile by imparting or withdrawing whatever promotes vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of human sustenance, then, soil is a workshop; air,\r\nmoisture, light, heat, and decomposing organized bodies, raw materials;\r\nplants and animals, machinery; certain minerals and labours, oil for the\r\nmachinery. In manufacturing produce, nature supplies air, light, heat,\r\nand moisture; man furnishes organized bodies, machinery, and oil, which\r\nmay generally all be obtained by capital. The parts performed by nature\r\nand man vary according to the fabric produced. In the case of pasturage,\r\nnature contributes the greatest share; in cultivation the capital skill\r\nand industry of man is conspicuous. The neglected farm, incapable of\r\nproducing turnip with a visible bulb, yields a full crop with a\r\njudicious application of labour and manure. The united exertions of\r\nnature and man ensure success. She accomplishes much when unaided by\r\nman, but he cannot obtain any thing without the assistance of nature.\r\nWhen she withholds heat or moisture, the manufacture is suspended, and\r\nshe possesses the power of arresting or altogether destroying the\r\nmachinery. Farmers combine nature’s agency under the term climate, and\r\nthey are familiar with the general effects of heat, frost, drought, and\r\nmoisture. If given quantities of manure and labour were bestowed on\r\nequal portions of soil, similar in quality, situated in Scotland, on a\r\nlevel with the ocean, and the top of a mountain, the difference of\r\nproduce would be the effect of climate.\r\n\r\nMan has been doomed to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.\r\nExperience confirms that the industry of an individual, closely applied\r\nto the cultivation of the soil in the temperate climes of the world, is\r\nmore than adequate to supply sustenance to himself. It is a beautiful\r\nfeature in farming, that agricultural improvements furnish additional\r\nfood, increase almost every comfort, and ameliorate climate. The\r\ngoodness of God to man is thus manifested, in providing him with the\r\nmeans of subsistence, and a reward according to his industry.\r\n\r\nA person who intends emigrating ought to consider well what his\r\nprospects are likely to be in the country of his birth, and in the\r\ndistrict to which he is to move, and be guided by a balance of their\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. You have chosen the profession of farmer,\r\nand I shall, in connexion with America, direct your attention to a few\r\nparticulars affecting East Lothian agriculture, the district in which\r\nyou reside, and its state is perhaps not widely different from the\r\nagriculture of other parts of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe results of nature, capital, and labour, forming farm produce, it\r\nbecomes desirable to ascertain the proportions which they contribute. It\r\nis impossible, perhaps, to fix on them with accuracy in any particular\r\ncase, and their combinations are variable. Endeavour, however, to obtain\r\na clear comprehension of the separate parts they perform in the\r\nmanufacture of human sustenance. They deeply affect the question of\r\nemigration from Britain, the choice of locality elsewhere, and the\r\nemployment of capital and cultivation generally. Farm economy is\r\naltogether depending on them, and the success or failure of operations\r\nintimately connected with their combinations.\r\n\r\nThe soil of East Lothian is owned in large masses by landholders, who\r\nseldom contribute much towards farming except building accommodation.\r\nThe properties being secured to them and their heirs by laws of entail,\r\ntheir own imprudence cannot deprive them of the land, and not possessing\r\nthe power of disposing of it, they have little inducement to improve it.\r\nBeing, many of them, unacquainted with agriculture, they are incapable\r\nof managing their properties, which are, consequently, placed under the\r\ncharge of agents, who are generally lawyers, residing in towns, without\r\nknowledge of farming. Landholders too often only interest themselves in\r\nland as shelter for game, and agents as the source of rent; the\r\ninterests of both parties being temporary, they pursue their hobby,\r\nregardless of ultimate consequences, and occasionally without sympathy\r\nfor their fellow-creatures residing on the soil. There is sometimes a\r\nperson under the agent, called Factor, who, from being the medium of\r\ncommunicating with the tenantry, possesses much influence, which is\r\ngenerally used, for good or evil, to please his employer.\r\n\r\nLand is generally occupied on a lease, which endures nineteen years; and\r\nit is by the skill and capital of tenant-farmers that the soil is\r\ncultivated, and that almost all agricultural improvements have been\r\nintroduced. The farmers employ yearly servants called hinds, a highly\r\ndeserving class of operatives.\r\n\r\nAs the population and wealth of Britain increase, there is employment\r\nfor a proportionate number of individuals in most professions—such, for\r\nexample, as bakers and shoemakers. It is otherwise with farmers, because\r\nthe soil has long been entirely occupied, and it does not expand with an\r\nincrease of population. Indeed an opposite rule seems to apply to this\r\nprofession, skill and capital enabling an individual to manage a greater\r\nextent of land. These circumstances, joined to the natural desire\r\nmankind have to till the soil, have created much competition for renting\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe corn-laws have been denominated a bread-tax, but they ought to be\r\nnamed rent laws, as their practical effect has been to raise the rent of\r\nland without benefiting any one engaged in agriculture, except a few\r\nfarmers during an existing lease. They are a tax on the community for\r\nthe benefit of landholders, so admirably devised, that it is levied\r\nwithout expense, farmers acting as gratis collectors, and paying the\r\nproceeds in the name of rent. Corn-laws have long given a fictitious\r\nvalue to farm produce, and created delusive hopes in farmers which led\r\nto their own ruin. At present they are injurious to the agricultural\r\nlabourer and farmer, because while they continue and are subject to\r\nchange, rational data for renting land and investing capital in its\r\ncultivation cannot exist, and their abrogation will sooner or later be\r\neffected by public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe present defective leases of farms continuing fixed for nineteen\r\nyears, are injurious, by giving rise to an improving mode of agriculture\r\nat the commencement, a stationary mode in the middle, and a\r\ndeteriorating system at the termination of the lease. Thus, the\r\nfertility of a farm fluctuates, instead of progressing unchecked till\r\nthe end of time. A nineteen years’ lease is often hurtful to a farmer,\r\nby binding him to a bad bargain for such a length of time, and involving\r\nhis heirs in the difficulty which, in case of a young family, is a more\r\nserious step than binding himself. Leases have also tended to lessen the\r\nlandlord’s interest in his property, and estrange him from the tenantry.\r\nSo much is this the case, that at the present time many landlords are\r\naltogether unacquainted with their tenantry, and a good feeling does not\r\nalways exist between them. Were land occupied on proper terms, with a\r\nproper lease, the case would be different. The landlord would then have\r\na direct interest in the cultivation of his property, in the management\r\nof his tenant, and in the welfare of every being residing on the soil. A\r\nworthless character, or bad farmer, would be got rid of, and the farm of\r\na tyrannical or illiberal landlord soon abandoned. In short it would be\r\nin the option of the parties to separate at short periods, which would\r\nprevent jarring, and a community of interests would ensure the\r\nprogressive productiveness of the farm. The idea of a copartnership of\r\nevery individual engaged in cultivating the soil, would, in some\r\nmeasure, be realized, and good feeling maintained amongst them. In some\r\nparts of England where annual leases prevail, I have witnessed as good\r\nfarming as I ever saw in Scotland, and perfect harmony existed between\r\nlandlords and tenants, and the latter seemed to enjoy more of the\r\ncomforts and luxuries of life than Scottish farmers. However\r\nadvantageous leases may have proved in former times, when the tenantry\r\nwere bowed down by oppression and poverty, their effects, of late years,\r\nwhen competition for renting land has been so great, and the value of\r\nfarm produce retrograding, have been injurious to the tenantry and the\r\nadvancement of agriculture. The terms of lease seem only calculated for\r\nprogressive prices of farm produce, and have proved ruinous during\r\ndeclining ones. It would be easy to remedy the defects of the present\r\nlease, but, under existing circumstances, visionary to expect their\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\nOn the termination of a lease the farm is generally advertised to be let\r\nby receiving written offers on a mentioned day. The landlord and his\r\nagent knowing little about its value, a tenant is accepted after every\r\nattempt has been made to obtain rent above the written offers, by\r\noperating on the feelings and local attachments of the former tenant,\r\nwhich seldom fail to ripen during a lease. From all parts of the country\r\ncandidates of different descriptions appear. Men of sanguine\r\ntemperament, without calculation, unacquainted with the peculiarities of\r\nthe district, and looking forward to the prices of produce returning to\r\nwhat they were upwards of twenty years ago. Adventurers, trusting to get\r\na reduction of rent after obtaining possession, and reckless of the\r\nconsequence of the step they have taken, having perhaps little capital\r\nto lose, and content to live, year after year, dependents on the\r\nproperty, and with arrears of rent accumulating. People merely wishing a\r\nplace of residence, and not calculating on profit from the farm, having\r\nthe means of living from other sources.\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of East Lothian farmers, that during the last twenty\r\nyears perhaps three-fourths of them have not fulfilled their original\r\ncontracts, and the funds that have been lost in cultivating the soil is\r\nincalculable. I have known a tenant rent a farm with a capital of seven\r\nthousand pounds sterling, consisting of about 400 acres, and remove from\r\nit before the expiry of his lease, with only five hundred pounds in his\r\npocket, and in arrears of rent to his landlord the sum of three thousand\r\npounds. Mr ——, of our acquaintance, on a farm under 100 acres, incurred\r\ntwelve hundred pounds of arrears, and got off by paying only two hundred\r\nof them. With such competitors, a young man who must live by his\r\nprofession, can hardly wish to be successful. The obtaining of a lease\r\nat the present time may often be considered little better than the first\r\nchance of being ruined, and many tenants, after leading anxious lives,\r\nand exposed to the insults of rent exactors, may think themselves\r\nfortunate if they escape with a remnant of their fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe feeling that landholders, agents, and factors sometimes evince\r\ntowards the tenantry is so hostile, that a small portion of the farmers\r\noriginally connected with East Lothian obtain leases of late years, the\r\nnew tenants generally coming from other countries. So much is this the\r\ncase, that I have sometimes regarded such tenants as a proscribed race,\r\nand thought that the sooner most of them put their house in order for\r\nremoval the better for themselves. It is of no consequence how\r\nrespectable the old tenant may be in private life, or high in his\r\nprofession. A promise of rent, although not likely to be fulfilled, is a\r\nnever-failing recommendation to a stranger, when joined to subserviency,\r\nwithout which it is very difficult to obtain a farm on any terms. If a\r\ntenant has opinions, they must agree with those of agents or factors on\r\nthe estate, or warfare ensues; and if he is an individual of talent or\r\nindependent feeling, he is hunted with more zeal as a dangerous person,\r\nand every species of annoyance and persecution is hurled against him. A\r\ntenant of great enterprise, who had obtained a conventional reduction of\r\nrent some years ago, in consequence of a _fall_ in prices, was lately\r\ncalled before an agent and questioned about his management. The tenant\r\nmaintained his innovation on the common system to be an improvement, but\r\nwas told by the agent that if it was found he had injured the land,\r\ndamages must be paid, and if, as was alleged, a discovery had been made,\r\nit was fair the landholder should participate in the discovery, and no\r\nreduction of rent would be made in future, although prices had _fallen_\r\nthirty per cent since the conventional reduction was granted. About\r\nfifteen years ago, eleven tenants resided on a certain estate, and since\r\nthen the effects of ten of them have been sequestrated and sold at the\r\ninstance of the landholder, and in all probability the remaining tenant\r\nwill remove elsewhere in a few months. On a division of another estate,\r\nthe tenants have all been twice changed in twelve years, and one of the\r\nfarms in the same time has had four tenants, three of whom became\r\nbankrupts. With such examples before their eyes, tenants eagerly seek\r\nafter farms at rents which cannot be realized from its disposable\r\nproduce. Their case soon becomes hopeless, but, being bound for nineteen\r\nyears, they are generally held until their funds are exhausted, when\r\nthey are sacrificed, according to the partial laws of the country, to\r\nmake room for a new victim. The original tenants of East Lothian have\r\nbeen accounted fine gentlemen—extravagant fellows, devouring so much of\r\nthe produce of the soil that they scarcely leave any of it for the\r\nlandholder—an allegation which is unfounded, and which has hitherto\r\nserved as a pretext for harshness. It has been suggested that the\r\nmanagers of great estates are fond of power and adulation, and cannot\r\nbrook the idea of farmers approaching themselves in the refinements of\r\nlife; hence the harsh treatment of the tenantry and the success of\r\nsubserviency.\r\n\r\nThere is a prevalent idea that small farms occupied by hard working men\r\nafford more rent than possessions of larger size, and on some estates\r\nsmall farms are forming. The effects of a division of labour, skill, and\r\ncapital must be nearly the same in farming as in most other\r\nmanufactories, and a very short trial of tenants without capital,\r\nhowever they may live, will prove this position by the altered fertility\r\nof the soil, which is illustrated by the state of Irish agriculture. In\r\nIreland farm produce is the result of nature and imperfect labour; but\r\nin East Lothian the results of capital, skill, and improved labour enter\r\ninto the combination; and in the latter the produce of land is much\r\ngreater than in the former. But the landholders of Ireland are perhaps\r\nmore wealthy than those of East Lothian, compared with the people of the\r\nrespective countries. A crowded and agricultural population will pay\r\nrent in proportion to its degradation, or, at least, afford in such a\r\nratio influence and rank to landholders. This rule is not, however,\r\napplicable to Britain, where commerce and manufactures flourish, whose\r\nprofits of stock and wages of labour ultimately affect those of\r\nagriculture, and the selfish attempts at degrading the farmers of East\r\nLothian will recoil on their authors. For a time tenants without capital\r\ncan pay high rents, by extracting from the soil the means of fertility\r\nimparted to it by others; but the deteriorated condition of the farm is\r\nultimately a loss to the landholder and the community.\r\n\r\nThe capital which is required to put the operations of an East Lothian\r\nfarm in full motion, the tenant maintaining himself and reaping a crop\r\nwithout the aid of credit, may be stated at seven pounds sterling, or\r\nnearly thirty-five dollars per imperial acre. The rent which is\r\nstipulated to be paid, and the capital expended in fertilizing the soil,\r\nrenders the step which he takes a serious speculation. If a bad crop or\r\ntwo occurs at the commencement of the lease, the tenant will be unable\r\nto pay the rent, and he is then deprived of the lease, or allowed to\r\ncontinue a dependent on the estate. Being bound for nineteen years, he\r\nhas not the option of removing from the farm, and is very seldom\r\npermitted to do so while a tangible farthing of his funds remain. At all\r\ntimes he leads an anxious life without bodily toil, and is seldom\r\nremunerated for his exertions and risk of capital. Industry and\r\nenterprise may enable him to struggle to the end of his lease. Should he\r\ndie and leave a wife and young family, the unexpired years of the lease\r\nwould in all probability ruin them, his funds being liable for the rent,\r\nand they would be incapable of managing the farm without incurring great\r\nloss. Two thousand pounds may be stated as an ordinary capital to\r\ncommence farming with; and it is hopeless for a person without\r\nconsiderable funds to think of farming at all.\r\n\r\nThe hinds, or farm-servants of East Lothian, are, perhaps, the steadiest\r\nand most praiseworthy race of men in the world, and indifferently\r\nrewarded for the important part which they act in farm economy, living\r\non poor fare, and in bad cottages. Up to the present time, the best\r\nfeeling has existed between them and the tenantry; and there are\r\nthousands of instances of men having died of old age in the service of\r\ntheir first employers, without an abatement of income having been made\r\nduring sickness or infirmity. But a change is taking place in their\r\ncondition, by the pressure on the tenantry weakening attachments, and\r\nforbidding an indulgence of generosity towards their faithful and\r\nproficient operatives. Mutual confidence and assistance, in the\r\ndifferent classes engaged in farming, forms the strength of the East\r\nLothian system of agriculture, and the true source of happiness of all\r\ninterested in it. Kindness and attention, on the part of landholders\r\ntowards the tenantry, commonly radiates to farm-servants, from them to\r\nthe animals under their charge, and the happiness of all is thereby\r\npromoted. On the other hand, harshness and neglect shown by landholders\r\nto the tenantry, descends to servants and animals, and general\r\nuneasiness is the result. Some of the recently introduced tenantry bring\r\nall their operatives from other districts, and have commenced the\r\n_Bothie_ system, which is highly demoralizing in its effects on the men\r\nwho are subjected to it, although it is somewhat cheaper than the\r\ncustomary mode of treating the ploughmen. The prospect of this class\r\nbettering their condition is hopeless, and there is reason to apprehend\r\ntheir comforts will be curtailed.\r\n\r\nThe rural population of East Lothian appears to be undergoing an unhappy\r\nchange. The management of landed property is almost entirely intrusted\r\nto agents, who, like the middlemen of Ireland, have no permanent\r\ninterest in the soil, nor sympathy with its cultivators; and, like that\r\ncountry, East Lothian now suffers from the effects of absenteeism, so\r\nfar as the interests and feelings of the rural inhabitants are\r\nconcerned. The landholders and tenantry are unknown to each other, and\r\ndislike may sometimes be traced in both parties. The tie of farmer and\r\nploughman is waxing weak, and instead of the quietness of conduct which\r\nnow pervades all classes, a very few years may develope the troubles of\r\nIreland, and the south of England.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated, that nature contributes much towards the\r\nmanufacture of farm produce; but the fruits of her exertion do not\r\nbenefit the tenant nor operative. The landholders receive as rent all\r\nthat results from nature, and also a considerable portion flowing from\r\nthe tenant’s capital and the operative’s labour. The tax which the\r\ncorn-laws impose on the unagricultural portion of the population, for\r\nthe benefit of landholders, is collected free of expense by the\r\ntenantry. The ragged and half-starved peasant of Ireland labours\r\namongst, and begs from, the people of Britain, and, on reaching home,\r\ngives his earnings to the owner of the soil, that he may be permitted to\r\nexist only on the potato he himself cultivates. The East Lothian tenant\r\nof the present day is often not more happily situated, gradually paying\r\nthe landholder the earnings of early life, or inherited wealth, for the\r\nprivilege of occupying the soil, and returning its produce. It is\r\nfortunate landholders do not possess the power of preventing the\r\npopulation removing to other countries, and there growing produce for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere seems but little in the present constitution and state of\r\nagricultural relations to brighten futurity. An abrogation of the\r\ncorn-laws would ensure an extended application of capital to the soil,\r\nand create employment for operatives. Annulling the law of entail would\r\nproduce landholders interested in agriculture and the people who follow\r\nit. But however beneficial might be the effects of such measures, the\r\nevil of a limited surface with a numerous population would remain. The\r\nlandholder would perhaps be reduced to the necessity of superintending\r\nthe cultivation of a part of his own soil, and generally interest\r\nhimself in his estate. The situation of tenants and operatives would\r\nonly be improved for a short while, as they would soon compete with each\r\nother as before. Neither of them are at present adequately remunerated\r\nfor their exertions. To expect much improvement in their condition while\r\npopulation is so numerous, seems hopeless; and individuals will require\r\nto exert themselves to maintain their present position.\r\n\r\nI have treated generally of East Lothian agriculture, and the classes\r\nimmediately connected with it, without noticing examples of wisdom and\r\ngenerosity on the part of landholders, or of folly and worthlessness\r\namongst tenants and operatives. My object has been to bring the unsound\r\nparts of the system under notice, in order that an estimate of future\r\nprospects might be formed. But all classes may be regarded as the\r\nvictims of circumstances which have not perhaps been of their own\r\ncreating, and they are more deserving of sympathy than censure. While\r\nwhat appeared to me to be the true state of things has been freely\r\ndescribed, I disclaim feelings of bitterness or reproach towards man or\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  _Persons engaged in American Agriculture—American and\r\n    British Agriculture—Application of Capital and Labour to\r\n    Cultivation—Rent—Price of Land—Proportions of Nature—Capital and\r\n    Labour in the Production of Farm Produce, and their distribution in\r\n    Britain and America—Capital required to stock a Farm in both\r\n    Countries—Unhealthiness of America—Climate—State of\r\n    Society—Situation of young Men without Capital—Choosing America or\r\n    Britain._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn North America, extensive landholders are not common in any of the\r\ndistricts which I visited; and where they do exist, a great part of\r\ntheir possessions are unproductive. The soil is chiefly cultivated by\r\nits owners, who, in sundry respects, resemble the tenants of Scotland;\r\nand they often perform a great portion of the manual labour of the farm.\r\nIn many parts of the country, which has been long settled, the farmers\r\nare opulent, participating in all the conveniences of life; and, without\r\npassing their time in absolute idleness, hire a good deal of labour. In\r\nthe more recently settled parts, farmers have few of the elegancies and\r\nconveniences of life, with an ample share of its necessaries. They do\r\nnot labour hard after the first three or four years of settlement, and\r\nseem to live without much care. Land does not invest its owner with any\r\nprivilege or status in society.\r\n\r\nRenters of land, or tenants, are common in many parts, and in all\r\nrespects rank as landholders. The terms of rent are variable. Near\r\ntowns, and in thickly-peopled districts, a small rent is paid in money,\r\nand a lease of several years taken. In remote situations, land is\r\ncommonly let on shares from year to year. If the owner of the soil\r\nfurnishes seed and labouring animals, he gets two-thirds of the produce,\r\nwhen on the field, and removed from the earth. If the tenant supplies\r\nanimals and seed, the landowner gets one-third. But terms may vary\r\naccording to situation, soil, and crop.\r\n\r\nFarm-hired men, or by whatever other name they may be distinguished, are\r\nto be had in all old settled districts, and also in many of the new\r\nones. In most cases their reward is ample, and their treatment good,\r\nliving on the same kind of fare and often associating with their\r\nemployers. A great deal of farm labour is performed by piece-work.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of a country is affected by local circumstances, and\r\nfarming in Britain and in the remote parts of America may be considered\r\nthe extremes of the art. In the one country the farmer aims to assist,\r\nand in the other to rob nature. When the results of capital and labour\r\nare low, compared with the hire of them, they are sparingly applied to\r\nthe cultivation of the soil, in which case nature is oppressed and\r\nneglected, if I may be allowed to use such terms; and when they are\r\nhigh, compared with their hire, she is aided and caressed. Both systems\r\nare proper in the respective countries; and, by assuming a fixed result\r\nfor nature, they admit of arithmetical demonstration. Along the eastern\r\nshores of America, manures and a considerable portion of hired labour\r\nare applied to the cultivation of the soil; but in remote districts\r\nmanures are not used, and the smallest indispensable quantity of labour\r\nbestowed. In the eastern parts, the results of capital and labour enter\r\ninto the productions of the soil; in remote districts the aid of capital\r\ncan scarcely be said to have been called into action, and in both\r\nsituations nature is the chief agent.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances affecting the application of capital and labour to the\r\ncultivation of the soil in Britain and America are as opposite as their\r\nsystems of farming. In Britain, with her limited surface and dense\r\npopulation, nature’s contribution towards the production of farm produce\r\nis given to the landholder as rent, and the rural inhabitants living\r\nnear the starvation point, the price of provisions regulates in a great\r\nmeasure the hire of labour. Accordingly, the wages of agricultural\r\nlabour in the different parts of the country are proportionate to the\r\nvalue of their produce; being lowest in the remote and inclement\r\nsituations, and highest in the most favoured districts. In America, the\r\nextent of soil and thin population has not distorted effects, and\r\nnature’s portion of farm produce is not absorbed by rent. The results of\r\ncapital and labour being represented in quantities of produce, and their\r\nhire paid in money, it follows, that the cash-value of the former must\r\ngenerally exceed the latter, and that an additional application of\r\ncapital and labour to cultivation is a consequence of produce being high\r\npriced compared with their hire. Accordingly, in all parts of the\r\ncountry where produce is high, labour is low, and where produce is low,\r\nlabour is high.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, the hire of agricultural labour has been affected, and in\r\nall probability will continue to be regulated, by the wages of the\r\nunagricultural part of the population. Without manufactures and\r\ncommerce, the condition of her rural inhabitants would have approached\r\nthe present state of the Irish people. In America, the returns of the\r\nagriculturist appear to regulate the wages of other classes. When they\r\nare high, other classes are attracted to farming; when low, farmers\r\nchange their profession;—Americans generally being able to exercise two\r\nor three professions.\r\n\r\nThe origin and progress of rent seem to admit of easy solution. In the\r\nwestern prairies of America, where cheap and good cleared land is almost\r\nas abundant as air, rent is unknown, except in the neighbourhood of\r\ntowns. In the eastern districts, where good cleared land is of limited\r\nextent, compared with the inhabitants, rent is paid. Thus, population is\r\nthe origin of rent, which is the value of produce above what it hath\r\ncost in raising and carrying to market. At first, it consists of a small\r\nportion of the produce furnished by nature; with an increase of\r\npopulation the whole is absorbed, and ultimately also, parts of the\r\nresults of capital and labour. Rent is also affected by the condition as\r\nwell as by the number of the people; and, under a parity of\r\ncircumstances, will be found to augment in the ratio of the number and\r\nmisery of the agricultural inhabitants.\r\n\r\nUntil land yields rent, it is not worth purchase-money, and in\r\nproportion to a rise of rent its price will increase. Lands, therefore,\r\nsell at a considerable sum on the eastern side of America, and diminish\r\nin price to the westward, unless enhanced by localities of situation. As\r\npopulation increases in the west, and labour falls, land will rise in\r\nvalue, cheap land and cheap labour being incompatible with each other.\r\nBut the investment of capital in the purchase and cultivation of land\r\ndepends also on the profits of stock, or rate of interest in the\r\ncountry, the tangibility of the investment, and many other things.\r\n\r\nFrom the high price of produce, and comparatively cheap labour and\r\nmanure in the eastern parts, capital, judiciously employed in\r\ncultivation, yields an ample return. But the low produce and high labour\r\nin the west renders it unprofitable to employ much capital in\r\ncultivation at present in that situation. From the great advantages\r\nwhich the western districts possess over the eastern ones in cheapness\r\nand fertility of soil, and consequent reward of labour, population will\r\nflow into them, and render a rise in the value of land more probable\r\nthere than in the eastern parts.\r\n\r\nHaving frequently alluded to the results of nature, capital, and labour,\r\nin the production of farm produce and their distribution, I shall\r\nendeavour to illustrate the subject hypothetically, for the purpose of\r\nassisting in forming an opinion of their general bearings. The results\r\nof capital and labour employed in cultivation cannot always be\r\nseparated, and perhaps they ought to be classed together. The assumed\r\ndata does not include capital invested in the purchase of land, and I do\r\nnot wish the accuracy of the statement to be relied on, although I think\r\nit approaches to correctness.\r\n\r\n        In East Lothian produce, let nature be represented by 3\r\n           Capital,                                           1\r\n           Labour,                                            3\r\n                                                              —\r\n                               Total,                         7\r\n\r\nNature’s share being given as rent, and also part of the results of\r\ncapital and labour, the landholder perhaps gets a portion, expressed by\r\n3½, leaving 3½ for the tenant, labourers, and all other expenses of\r\ncultivation. But the expenses of cultivation and rent must be paid under\r\nall circumstances, and frequently nothing remains for the tenant. This\r\nis particularly obvious in unproductive seasons when the diminished crop\r\nmay be represented by 4, leaving the tenant, after discharging taxes and\r\nsome other things, without a farthing to pay rent. I myself have been so\r\nsituated, and human means cannot prevent such visitations. Hence the\r\nspeculative nature of farming, and the results which have flowed from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n        In American produce, let nature be represented by     3\r\n           Capital,                                           0¼\r\n           Labour,                                            1¼\r\n                                                              ——\r\n                               Total,                         4½\r\n\r\nIn the eastern parts where rent is paid, the landholder’s portion may be\r\n1, leaving 3½ for the tenant and expenses of cultivation. In remote\r\ndistricts where capital is scarcely employed, the whole produce falls to\r\nbe divided between the landholder and labourers, and the landholder\r\nenjoys it without division, when the labour is performed by his own\r\nhands. Although the divisible portion appears the same in both\r\ncountries, the labour and capital employed in cultivation is perhaps\r\nfive times greater in Britain than in western America. On a given\r\nsurface the produce is greater in Britain, but in America the produce is\r\ngreater in proportion to the labour employed in cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn East Lothian the farmer gives the fruits of nature and part of the\r\nresults of capital and labour to the landholder as rent. In western\r\nAmerica the farmer shares nature’s bounty with the labourer, or enjoys\r\nit himself by labouring with his own hands. In East Lothian the farmer\r\nof the present time is in some degree the servant of the landholder. In\r\nwestern America the farmer has nature for his servant, or at least\r\nenjoys her labours. With such an assistant what industrious man can be\r\npoor?\r\n\r\nIn the event of death or old age, nature still continues her services to\r\nthe American farmer, by furnishing grass and other commodities. A widow\r\nor young family, almost under any circumstances, could milk cows and\r\nplant potatoes. Bountiful nature would provide grass for the animals and\r\nmature the potatoes, on the produce of which the family might live. In\r\nEast Lothian a widow or young family, after being ruined, would be\r\nturned adrift on the world.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern parts of America land may be purchased and stocked for\r\nnearly the sum an East Lothian farmer expends in stocking and improving\r\na farm, namely L.7 per acre. But if the land has great local advantages,\r\nthe price will be considerably higher. In the western parts of the\r\nUnited States, prairie land of the best quality, without the least\r\nobstacle to cultivation, and to any extent, may be had. For the sum of\r\nthree hundred pounds sterling a farm of 200 acres could be bought and\r\nstocked in the prairies of western America. In East Lothian farming is a\r\nhazardous calling; in America there is no risk attending it. In East\r\nLothian L.2000 is required to stock a farm; in the Western States L.300\r\nwill purchase and stock one nearly of equal size. In East Lothian a\r\nfarmer has mental annoyance with bodily ease; in America he has mental\r\nease with personal labour. In East Lothian a young farmer commences his\r\ncareer in affluence, and at middle age finds himself in poverty; in\r\nAmerica he begins with toil, and is in easy circumstances by middle age.\r\n\r\nBut however favourable American farming may appear when simply viewing\r\nthe quantity of produce, the country has many disadvantages deserving of\r\nconsideration, and one of the most important is its unhealthiness. The\r\nwhole of North America is liable to ague and fevers of various kinds,\r\nand the chief difference of situation in these respects seems to be\r\nowing to cultivation. The more cultivation is extended, the healthier\r\nthe climate becomes, but occasionally ague and fever prevails in all\r\nsituations. I found fever and ague at Hyde Park, on the banks of the\r\nHudson, at Niagara, Whitby, and Chatham, in Upper Canada. The\r\ninhabitants on the prairies of Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and\r\nMissouri, were suffering much from fever when I was amongst them. Almost\r\nevery person you meet with in America tells you of the healthiness of\r\nhis situation, and the unhealthiness of other parts of the country. The\r\ncause of fever and ague in America does not appear connected with\r\nmarshes or stagnant waters, as the inhabitants residing on the dry open\r\nprairie of 100 miles in extent are not exempt from its attacks, but is\r\nthought to arise from the miasms of decaying vegetation; and the rich\r\nbottoms, covered with rank vegetation, on the banks of rivers are the\r\nmost unhealthy situations. While journeying over the prairies of\r\nIllinois after nightfall in autumn, when vegetation was decaying, the\r\nsmell of fermenting grasses was unpleasantly strong, and reminded me of\r\nthe odour of a sweating hay-stack in Scotland. In almost every part of\r\nthe world where the earth’s surface is uncultivated and well clothed\r\nwith vegetation, fever and ague prevails, and is found to abate as\r\ncultivation is introduced. Thus bountiful nature at once rewards the\r\nenterprising farmer with her fruits and a more salubrious atmosphere.\r\nWhat incentives to industry!\r\n\r\nThe climate of North America is remarkable for variations of\r\ntemperature, and most situations seem alike in this respect. But the\r\nduration of winter increases, and length of summer decreases, with the\r\nlatitude of the situation. The region of North America is not so\r\ncongenial to human life as Britain, but far more so than the East and\r\nWest Indies and many other parts of the world. In such a vast continent\r\ncultivation is alone wanting to render it healthy.\r\n\r\nThe state of society in America is very different from what it is in\r\nBritain, there being less refinement and fewer of the elegancies of life\r\nenjoyed. I am satisfied, however, from experience, that much of what is\r\nknown by, and appreciated as, the comforts of life, arises from fashion\r\nand force of habit, and that a few weeks’ residence will reconcile a\r\nreasonable person to the change. Throughout the greater part of the\r\ncountry, fashion has not established her empire, and there is little\r\nvieing amongst the inhabitants. The handsome bound volumes which adorn\r\nthe drawingrooms of Britain, are not more instructive or amusing in\r\nconsequence of their showy exterior; and the meagre furnishings of\r\nAmerican log-houses, in the remote districts, meet the wishes of the\r\ninhabitants, and are found as useful as the most gaudy. Plain furniture\r\nis not despised where fine is never met with. In taverns, luxuries and\r\nrefinements are common, and wealth may obtain them almost any where. Of\r\nthe state of domestic society I am not qualified to speak from personal\r\nobservation, farther than that the manners and customs of the people\r\ndiffer from those of Britain. In the eastern parts the distinctions of\r\nclasses in society and elegancies of life approximate those of Britain,\r\nand both gradually diminish on proceeding to the westward. But in any\r\npart of America, where an emigrant may settle himself, he must lay his\r\naccount with a change in the social intercourse of life. Some people\r\nare, however, incapable of altering their manners and customs, and such\r\ncharacters may live without society.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern parts of America the luxuries and conveniences of life\r\nare cheaper, and the necessaries dearer, than in remote districts. The\r\neast should therefore be the abode of the wealthy, refined, and\r\nluxurious; the west, of the persons who value the necessaries of life,\r\nand such as are not of fastidious habits. But in no part of the country\r\nwill the fastidious find themselves happy.\r\n\r\nThe want of good assistants, servants, or helps, is ranked amongst\r\nAmerican privations. In the east assistance can at all times be had,\r\nwhich is not the case in the west; but in most situations high wages and\r\ngood treatment will obtain assistance. Female servants are very scarce,\r\nand said not to be good. To the wealthy and refined, who have resided in\r\nBritain, this state of things at first appears insupportable. They soon,\r\nhowever, learn to assist themselves in many things, and find their\r\nhappiness increased by doing so.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining servants arises from the ease with which\r\nindividuals obtain a livelihood, every industrious and sober character\r\nhaving the means of purchasing a good estate in the west with the\r\naccumulated savings of three years’ service. However much certain\r\nclasses may feel and regret the want of servants, the extraordinary\r\nreward which they receive ought in fairness to be accounted the\r\ncountry’s greatest blessing. In no other part of the world is industry,\r\nsobriety, and worth, so richly rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe influence which wealth has attained in Britain merits the\r\nconsideration of all young men without capital. Personal exertion is\r\noften considered degrading, and visited with the contumely of former\r\nassociates. To lose rank in society must be particularly galling to\r\nyoung men of spirit, and few in the middle walks of life can keep their\r\nplace without capital. This is one of the many inconveniences attending\r\na refined state of society, and is more likely to increase than diminish\r\nin Britain. In the remote parts of America wealth is not idolized. The\r\nindustrious youth may there follow any occupation without being looked\r\ndown upon or sustain loss of rank, and may rationally anticipate raising\r\nhimself. The plain style of buildings and household furnishings of such\r\nplaces are favourable to young people, and in almost every particular\r\ntheir situation may be said to be the reverse of what it is in Britain.\r\nA young man without capital and of good character, is almost sure to\r\ngain but cannot lose rank by emigrating to America, and will rarely\r\nmaintain his rank by remaining in Britain.\r\n\r\nIn judging then of the step of becoming an American agriculturist, all\r\nmay lay their account to undergo considerable privations at first\r\nsettlement, and lead a different life from the farmers of East Lothian.\r\nThe bountiful reward which industry receives soon enables good men to\r\npurchase land; and it is therefore often the unsteady and idle which\r\nhire themselves to farmers. On this account, it will be necessary to\r\nwork personally, by way of example and active superintendence. Right\r\nthinking people consider it no disgrace to labour in any part of the\r\nworld, and it is thought quite disreputable to be idle in America. East\r\nLothian farmers often toil mentally without remuneration; and the\r\nassurance that, while in America, all the fruits of a person’s own\r\nlabour, assisted by generous nature, accrues to himself, will nerve his\r\narm and sweeten his toil. The division of labour so beautifully effected\r\nin some of the operations of East Lothian agriculture, and which I may\r\nbe permitted to call professional luxuries, cannot be practised at\r\npresent in America. The wooden dwelling-house and barns will at first\r\nperhaps appear revolting, and may induce some people to think, that,\r\nwith the same privations and sacrifices, they would have been enabled to\r\nhave lived in East Lothian. Such is not, however, the case; because the\r\npressure on farmers arises from a competition of numbers, which would be\r\nincreased by lowering the standard of living; and the only result of\r\nsuch policy would be to raise the rent of land, and degrade all engaged\r\nin farming. Let no one, however, from my representations of American\r\nfarming, entertain too sanguine hopes of success. Farming, in most parts\r\nof the world, ranks low in the scale of professional remuneration; and\r\nwithout virtue, persevering industry, and sobriety of character, people\r\nwill not likely either become wealthy or happy. In nine cases out of\r\nten, a man’s success in life depends on his own exertions. America\r\npresents a fertile and extensive field, and whoever does not reap an\r\nabundant harvest, will, in all probability, find the cause of failure in\r\nhis own character. I cannot hold out an immediate or ultimate prospect\r\nof great wealth, as the low price of produce and high labour renders\r\nthis improbable. Every person may, however, obtain all the necessaries\r\nand most of the true comforts of life in the fullest abundance,\r\nunharassed by the cares of the present, or apprehensions of the future.\r\nThe pleasures of society are not likely to be so much enjoyed in America\r\nas in Britain; but, on the other hand, its mortifications are escaped.\r\nIn every part of the world, man ought to look to his family and himself,\r\nand not to society, for true happiness. If abundance of the necessaries\r\nof life do not ensure society in America, the want of abundance is\r\nalmost sure to lose society in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  _Lower Canada—Inhabitants—Climate—Soil—Mode of Selling\r\n    Land—Productions and Prices—Farming near Montreal—Climate affecting\r\n    Agriculture and Farmers._\r\n\r\n\r\nCanada originally consisted of one country, and was divided into two\r\nprovinces, Upper and Lower Canada, in 1791. It was discovered by Jacques\r\nCartier, a Frenchman, in 1535, and continued under dominion of the\r\nFrench until 1759, with exception of a year or two, when it was ceded to\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of the French, after the conquest by the English, were\r\nallowed to retain their laws and religion, which so attached them to the\r\nBritish government, that their fidelity remained unshaken during the war\r\nwith the colonies to the south, which now form part of the United\r\nStates. In the late war between Great Britain and the United States the\r\npopulation again continued faithful; and their antipathy to the\r\ninhabitants of the States seems to be unconquerable.\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the inhabitants of Lower Canada are descendants of\r\nthe French, who speak the French language, and retain most of their old\r\nmanners and customs. The rest of the inhabitants consist of all nations,\r\nand are chiefly descended from British subjects. The French Canadians\r\nprofess the Catholic religion; and lands held by Catholics pay one\r\ntwenty-sixth of the grain produce to the clergy. The exaction, however,\r\nseldom extends beyond the wheat crop; and the people of all religions\r\nrepresent the Catholic clergy of Lower Canada as the best disposed and\r\nmost inoffensive class of men in the province.\r\n\r\nThe French Canadians are chiefly engaged in agriculture, and are a most\r\nunenterprising race of individuals, and lead the same kind of life which\r\ntheir forefathers did upwards of two hundred years ago. They appear to\r\nbe poor, indolent, and a mirthful loving people. The commerce of the\r\nprovince is carried on chiefly by British subjects. In politics, there\r\nis a French and British party. At present the French interest is the\r\nmost numerous; it will, however, ultimately dwindle away.\r\n\r\nThe province of Lower Canada lies between forty-five and fifty-two\r\ndegrees of north latitude, and sixty-three and eighty-one of west\r\nlongitude, from Greenwich. The climate of America is very different from\r\nplaces of the same latitude in Europe, the degrees of heat and cold\r\nbeing much greater. Although lying considerably farther south than\r\nEngland, Fahrenheit’s thermometer ranges between ninety and one hundred\r\ndegrees in summer. In winter, the thermometer occasionally indicates\r\nthirty degrees below zero, and for six months the surface of the earth\r\nis covered with snow. The St Lawrence, which divides the province, runs\r\nin a north-easterly direction, and the climate becomes mild as the river\r\nis ascended. In the western part of the province, spring commences a\r\nmonth earlier than it does at Quebec, the capital of the district, and\r\nthe climate is in all respects superior for agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Lower Canada is perhaps as healthy as any in America,\r\nwhich may be owing to the length of time the banks of the St Lawrence,\r\nwhere the population chiefly reside, have been cultivated. In newly\r\nsettled districts, fever and ague, the scourge of America, is frequently\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe soil, which has been surveyed, is estimated by Bouchette at about\r\n16,000,000 acres, and is said to be inferior sand in the eastern parts,\r\nand to improve to the westward. This gradation of soil seems to be\r\npretty general in most parts of North America; but soils of the most\r\nopposite character are to be found in all situations, and America is as\r\nvariable in texture and quality of surface as Britain.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the cleared land is occupied by the descendants of\r\nthe French in narrow stripes, seldom exceeding 100 acres, and often\r\nextending miles in length. The tenures are of French origin, and it is\r\ndifficult to get a good title to land, without it has been disposed of\r\nat a sheriff’s sale. A considerable part of the land is held by English\r\ntenure, and to such there is no difficulty in obtaining good\r\ntitle-deeds.\r\n\r\nA considerable extent of crown lands is still undisposed of, and they\r\nare sold by public sale on the first day of every month, in every\r\ntownship where an agent resides. The upset price of the lands varies\r\nfrom 2s. 6d. to 10s. Halifax currency, by which all land in the Canadas\r\nare sold. The following are the conditions of sale for 1834:—\r\n\r\n“1st, The lands will be put up for sale in lots or parcels of from 100\r\n(or a half surveyed lot) to 1200 acres (or six surveyed lots), as may\r\nsuit the convenience of parties disposed to bid for the same.\r\n\r\n“2d, The lots will be offered at the upset price, as quoted above.\r\n\r\n“3d, The lots are to be taken at the contents marked in the public\r\ndocuments, without guarantee as to the actual quantity contained in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“4th, The biddings to be made in currency upon the upset price per acre.\r\n\r\n“5th, The lots will be sold to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\n“6th, The purchase-money to be paid by four annual instalments, without\r\ninterest. The first instalment or deposit-money of twenty-five per cent\r\nat the time of sale, and the second, third, and fourth instalments at\r\nintervals of a year.\r\n\r\n“7th, The instalments to be paid into the office of crown lands at\r\nQuebec, or the treasurer or receiver of rents on his half-yearly tour\r\nfor the collection of rents.\r\n\r\n“8th, If the instalments are not regularly paid, the deposit-money will\r\nbe forfeited, and the land again referred to sale.”\r\n\r\nThe chief productions of Lower Canada are wheat, barley, and oats, of\r\ninferior quality, which may be partly owing to the climate and the\r\nmanagement which the soil is under. For nearly half a century, manure\r\nhas not been applied to the greater part of the cultivated land, which,\r\nafter being what is considered exhausted, is allowed to produce a\r\nnatural sward of grass, on which animals browse during one summer, and\r\nit is again ploughed in autumn. Notwithstanding the natural goodness of\r\nmuch of the soil, the crops are of the worst description; and when all\r\nthings are taken into consideration, it is surprising to find them so\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nMuch of the land in the neighbourhood of Montreal, unconnected with the\r\nisland of that name, is of excellent quality, and, if properly drained\r\nand manured, might produce almost any description of crop.\r\n\r\nThe island of Montreal contains some good soil, of light texture, well\r\nadapted for market gardening, a department of husbandry at present\r\nhighly remunerating. The French Canadians being unwilling to dispose of\r\ntheir lands in the neighbourhood of the town of Montreal, and not likely\r\nsoon to change their present system of agriculture, the growing of\r\nvegetables will, in all probability, long continue profitable, even\r\nshould high prices induce settlers up the St Lawrence to transmit\r\nproduce when the communication with Montreal becomes improved, as it\r\nunquestionably will in progress of time.\r\n\r\nAgriculture produce of all kinds fetches a high price in Lower Canada,\r\nwhich does not seem to afford sufficient food for the inhabitants, and\r\nmore especially butcher meat. The following inland imports to Montreal\r\nare taken from the Commercial List.\r\n\r\n                        _Up to the 6th July_,  1832 .      1833.\r\n                                              —————        —————\r\n        Pork from Upper Canada,                3978         1149\r\n                  Lower Canada,                 526         1860\r\n                  United States,               6108        17805\r\n                                              —————        —————\r\n                               Total Barrels, 10612        20814\r\n                                              —————        —————\r\n\r\n                  Exports by sea from Canada, 1832.        1833.\r\n                                              —————        —————\r\n          Pork to the West Indies,             2285         1694\r\n               to other places,                1177         2586\r\n                                              —————        —————\r\n                               Total barrels,  3462         4280\r\n\r\nThese lists, containing only the imports to Montreal and the exports of\r\nthe whole province, show a considerable balance against the country,\r\nwhich would be greatly increased if the imports of the whole province\r\nwere included. It is probable other articles would also show an\r\nunfavourable balance.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of raising produce is unquestionably the cause of its\r\nhigh price, which is not likely to be lowered by other means than\r\nimporting supplies. The French Canadians, having few wants and strong\r\nlocal attachments, labour cheaply rather than remove to a distance,\r\nwhich, joined to the influx of destitute emigrants from Britain and\r\nIreland, renders wages lower perhaps than in any other part of the\r\nAmerican continent. High prices and cheap labour are favourable to\r\ninvesting capital in cultivation; and a skilful and prudent farmer\r\ncannot fail of being successful in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nMontreal. Here he will feel the change from Britain less than in any\r\nother part of America, with exception of climate, and even the length\r\nand severity of winter are said to be agreeable. A considerable extent\r\nof capital is required to purchase land in a good situation, which costs\r\nfrom L.10 to L.20 per acre. Land is also occasionally to be had on\r\nlease; and when a sufficient number of years, and proper terms are\r\nobtained, an outlay of capital in improving the soil would be\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nIf soil is the workshop of the farmer, and animals and plants his\r\nmachinery, the climate of Lower Canada is an impediment, seriously\r\naffecting plants, animals, and man, which cannot be removed. With six\r\nmonths of winter, the machinery of the farm is suspended half the year.\r\nFew plants can be properly matured, and crops, in all seasons, are\r\nliable to be injured by frost. Animals require a large supply of dry\r\nfodder, as succulent food cannot be provided, and the intense cold\r\nreduces them in condition. Man is so long prevented by winter from\r\nlabouring the soil, and so hurried by the shortness of spring and\r\nautumn, that he has not time to prepare it suitably for the reception of\r\ncrops. To these causes may be ascribed the leanness of animals, the high\r\nprice of produce, the poverty of the people, and the cheapness of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe climate is too cold for the cultivation of Indian corn, which only\r\noccasionally comes to maturity in the most favoured spots. Autumnal sown\r\nwheat is similarly situated, and the wheat of the country sown in spring\r\nis of the most inferior quality. Fahrenheit’s thermometer having stood\r\ntwelve degrees below the freezing point at Albany, in the state of New\r\nYork, on the 29th October, 1833, the cold, in all probability, must have\r\nbeen greater in Lower Canada, which is several degrees of latitude\r\nfarther north. Accordingly, a gentleman of my acquaintance, who settled\r\nin the township of Leeds, stated in a letter, “that misery and famine\r\nstared farmers in the face; frost having set in early, all their turnips\r\nand potatoes had been destroyed, and, in some cases, also their grain\r\ncrops.” The condition of the animals is also evidence of the severity of\r\nthe climate. Sheep and oxen, as seen by me in the months of summer, were\r\nmere skin and bone compared with those of Britain, which I attributed,\r\nin a great measure, to the cold of winter; and sheep of the Leicester\r\nbreed, sent from East Lothian, sunk under its effects in the most\r\nsoutherly part of the province.\r\n\r\nHowever much the man of pleasure may extol the winter of Lower Canada\r\nfor the glorious sleighing it affords—and its boasted advantages seem to\r\nbe confined to this mode of travelling—the industrious farmer must\r\nregard it as an evil, by suspending his operations, and injuring his\r\nlive-stock. Nature here assists him more sparingly than in warmer\r\nlatitudes, and he will not live comfortably on cleared land by his own\r\nlabour, except in the most southerly parts of the province. To clear\r\nforest land in most parts by his own exertions, would not reward him for\r\nfive or six years afterwards, if land was to be had for nothing, and its\r\ninferior produce cannot afford good wages to labourers. For the farmer\r\nof capital, the neighbourhood of Montreal holds out many advantages. The\r\nprovince is not, however, favourable to farmers who are in search of\r\nfood and clothing for themselves and families, and still less so for\r\nlabourers of any description. Both classes must, of necessity, be idle\r\nduring a considerable portion of the year, and they are not likely to\r\nimprove their condition by emigrating from Britain to Lower Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  _Upper Canada—Inhabitants—Climate—Soil—Mode of Selling Land, and\r\n    Prices—Bad Effects of Selling on Credit—Situation of Settlers\r\n    without Capital—Price of Land in Upper Canada and the Western United\r\n    States—Price of Land, and Mode of Settlement Injurious to the\r\n    Province—Suggestions for Improving the State of the Country._\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Canada became a separate province in 1791. It is bounded on the\r\neast by Lower Canada, and on the south by the river St Lawrence, and the\r\nchain of rivers and lakes to the west, the waters of which form the St\r\nLawrence. The boundaries in the north, and in the extreme west towards\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, are perhaps not accurately defined, and the surface\r\nof the province cannot be estimated.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of settling the mouth of the St Lawrence, the French\r\npenetrated into Upper Canada, and planted a colony on the river Detroit,\r\nwhere their descendants still reside. At the close of the war, in 1793,\r\nwhen the colonies of North America became independent of Britain, many\r\ninhabitants of the United States, who adhered to the government of the\r\nmother-country, moved into Upper Canada, where they obtained grants of\r\nland. At the same time many disbanded soldiers also received land. In\r\nthis way parts of the shores of lake Ontario, and lake Erie, and the\r\nbanks of the Niagara, Detroit, and Thames, were first settled. More\r\nrecently, many people of Dutch and German extraction have settled in the\r\nprovinces, as well as subjects of the United States; and there has been\r\na constant stream of emigration from Britain. The population, chiefly\r\nfound on the lakes and rivers, may amount to about 400,000, the greater\r\npart being of British descent.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada differs from the lower province in climate, by having a\r\nlonger summer and a shorter winter; while the extremes of heat and cold,\r\nas indicated by the thermometer, are nearly the same in both provinces.\r\nThe waters of the St Lawrence and lakes, forming the southern boundary\r\nof the district, inclining north-east, the climate improves in ascending\r\nthe waters, till reaching Amherstburgh, in about 42 degrees of latitude.\r\nThe province, as far as it is accurately known, has not an eminence of\r\nsufficient height to affect temperature, and the climate of the\r\ndifferent situations may be estimated according to their latitudes. In\r\nthe most southerly parts, near the head of lake Erie, the length of\r\nwinter varies from two to three months. Ploughing commences about the\r\nfirst of April; and cattle and horses are allowed to roam in the woods\r\nduring winter,—a practice which marks the mildness of climate, and also,\r\nperhaps, the laziness of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Upper Canada is as healthy as the lower province,\r\nalthough the inhabitants are more liable to sickness from the surface\r\nnot being so well cleared of forest. On my first entry to the country, I\r\nthought to judge of the healthiness of situations by the countenances of\r\nthe inhabitants, and if all of them had been born in the country, this\r\nmight have been a just criterion. There is something in the climate of\r\nAmerica which seems to impart a sallow and seared complexion to the\r\npeople. It is, however, many years before some natives of Britain lose\r\ntheir florid colour; and I have seen several people retaining their\r\ncomplexion after having resided twenty years in the province, while\r\ntheir children had the general hue of the country. Being unable to judge\r\nwhether the people had been born in the country, or were lately arrived\r\nfrom Britain, I abandoned the idea of taking the appearance of the\r\ninhabitants as an index to healthiness of situation. As I proceeded\r\nwestward, towards Chatham and Amherstburgh, the complexion of the people\r\nbecame less florid, which I attributed to most of them being natives of\r\nthe country. I found people afflicted with ague in many places, after\r\nhaving resided years in the district; and from information which I\r\nreceived, deserving of credit, I was led to believe almost every\r\nEuropean has a seasoning, or an attack of the ague. The rapidity and\r\nseverity of the attack, however, depends in a great measure on the\r\nsituation of individuals being aggravated by fatigue, imperfect\r\nclothing, bad food, and a damp house.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The following extracts are from the correspondence of my brother\r\n  Charles, dated Detroit, 7th August, 1834:—\r\n\r\n  “Through how many exciting scenes have I passed since we parted! For\r\n  two months tossed upon a stormy sea, with a disagreeable captain, in a\r\n  crazy vessel!—seen the most sublime of nature’s works, a stormy sea,\r\n  and such a storm!—stood on deck when not a soul, from the captain to\r\n  the cabin-boy, expected to live ten minutes! I have experienced\r\n  delight consequent on deliverance; leaped with joy at the sight of\r\n  land; admired the fairy scenery of Long Island and the Hudson when the\r\n  orchards were in full blossom,—and it is a sight of indescribable\r\n  beauty! I have travelled up the North river, at the rate of fifteen\r\n  miles an hour, in the finest steam-boats in the world—shot along the\r\n  railroads—crawled on the canals—been shaken in stage-coaches—and\r\n  crossed lakes Erie and Ontario, which for magnitude deserve the names\r\n  of inland seas. I have walked since the 7th of June 210 miles in Upper\r\n  Canada, 200 in Ohio, 50 in Pennsylvania, 160 in Illinois, and 150 in\r\n  Indiana and Michigan; in all nearly 800 miles. Some say, the\r\n  thermometer stood from 95 to 101 degrees in the shade. Often were my\r\n  clothes as wet with perspiration as if I had waded a river; still I\r\n  never experienced that lazy, listless feeling I have done during warm\r\n  weather in Scotland. My appetite was always keen, and it still\r\n  continues so.”\r\n\r\n  After residing in Upper Canada, on a second visit, for the space of\r\n  about 20 days, he writes from Cleveland,—“Do not be astonished at\r\n  learning I have got the ague. I have had three shaking days,—my\r\n  appetite is entirely gone. One day I feel quite well, and the next as\r\n  helpless as a child; and, altogether, the ague is not a pleasant\r\n  companion. I shall endeavour to bear it patiently.”\r\n\r\n  From Cincinnati he writes,—“When I wrote about fourteen days ago, I\r\n  was suffering from fever and ague, and had made up my mind to have it\r\n  for a companion for some months; but it only stayed with me a week. By\r\n  medicine and care I succeeded in banishing it, and now feel quite\r\n  well. It was brought on by carelessness and a desire to travel\r\n  cheaply. I have no doubt it will have a good effect in making me more\r\n  careful in future.”\r\n\r\nThe surface of Upper Canada is remarkable for want of hills, but much of\r\nit is considerably undulating; and where this formation prevailed, I\r\ngenerally found the soil of inferior quality. The soil is variable in\r\nall districts; much of it is very bad; and it may generally be termed of\r\nmedium quality. I could only judge of the soil by its natural\r\nappearance, which would be improved by cultivation. In all parts of the\r\ncountry, I found sandy soils the least productive; those composed of\r\nclay and heavy loam bearing the best crops of every description.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the writers who have treated of the soil of Upper Canada have\r\nrepresented the kinds of trees which grow on it an index of its quality;\r\nbut, after extensive observation, I was unable to trace the connexion\r\ngenerally. From the number of mouldering trees with which the forest is\r\nstrewed, I was led to imagine, generation hath succeeded generation\r\nsince the beginning of time; and it is an admitted fact, that one\r\ndescription of tree hath frequently been succeeded by a different\r\nspecies over a considerable extent of surface. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the kinds of trees have often more connexion with\r\npreceding events and species than the soil; and I regretted time did not\r\nadmit of my attempting to investigate the longevity of the trees, and\r\nthe kinds which succeed each other, or continue without change of\r\nspecies. It is, however, quite certain, that the oak is found occupying\r\nexclusively the best and the worst soils of the province, being that of\r\nsand, clay, and loam. Were it necessary, I could point out tracts of\r\ncountry in support of what I have advanced, and districts where a change\r\nof species of tree takes place without any apparent difference of soil.\r\nIf the kind of tree is not a criterion of soil, neither is the size of\r\nthe trees, which often depends on the number of them on a given space.\r\n\r\nThe quality of soil can only be ascertained by examination with a spade\r\nor some such instrument, and which ought also to embrace the subsoil. By\r\nsuch a mode of proceeding a judge of land cannot be deceived. It is as\r\neasy to learn to discriminate soils as trees, and both may be examined\r\nwith the same facility.\r\n\r\nThe whole surveyed land of Upper Canada is held by English tenure, with\r\nexception, perhaps, of some patches on the banks of the Detroit,\r\noccupied by people of French descent. There is a register in every\r\ntownship, in which money mortgaged on land must be entered before it is\r\nrecoverable, and by consulting which every purchaser may ascertain if\r\ngood titles to an estate can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe lands are in possession of the crown, the Canada Company, and\r\nprivate individuals, and may be had at all times to a reasonable extent.\r\nThe crown lands are disposed of according to the following document:—\r\n\r\n  “GOVERNMENT LANDS.\r\n\r\n  “In conformity to instructions recently received from his Majesty’s\r\n  Secretary of State for the Colonies, the following arrangements for\r\n  disposing of the waste lands of the crown in Upper Canada, are made\r\n  known for the information of emigrants and others.\r\n\r\n  “Except in the case of U. E. Loyalists, and other persons entitled by\r\n  the existing regulations of the government to free grants, no person\r\n  can obtain any of the waste lands of the crown otherwise than by\r\n  purchasing at the public sales, made from time to time under the\r\n  direction of the commissioner of crown lands.\r\n\r\n  “These sales will be made on the first and third Tuesday of each\r\n  month, and will either be continued through the following day or not,\r\n  as circumstances may appear to the agent to require.\r\n\r\n  “They will be held at the following places:—\r\n\r\n  “At Bytown, for the district of Bathurst.\r\n\r\n  “At Belleville, for the midland district.\r\n\r\n  “At Peterborough, for the district of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n  “At York, for the home district.\r\n\r\n  “At Hamilton, for the district of Gore.\r\n\r\n  “At London, for the district of London.\r\n\r\n  “At Chatham, for the western district.\r\n\r\n  “Besides these general periodical sales, there may be occasional sales\r\n  by auction in other districts, of such town lots, or other lots of\r\n  land as may remain to be disposed of; and of these sales ample notice\r\n  will be given.\r\n\r\n  “The conditions of every sale by public auction will be as\r\n  follows:—One fourth of the purchase money to be paid down, and the\r\n  remainder in three equal annual instalments, with interest at six per\r\n  cent on each instalment, payable with the instalment.\r\n\r\n  “The lands will be put up at an upset price, of which notice will be\r\n  given at the time of sale, and in the previous advertisements which\r\n  will be published of the lands intended to be put up at each sale; and\r\n  in case no offer shall be made at the upset price, the land will be\r\n  reserved for future sale in a similar manner by auction.\r\n\r\n  “A patent for the lands will be issued free of charge upon the payment\r\n  in full of the purchase money and interest.\r\n\r\n  “The regular periodical sales will be held for the first time as\r\n  follows:—In Peterborough, York, and Hamilton, on the third Tuesday in\r\n  June next; and in Bytown, Belleville, London, and Chatham, on the\r\n  first Tuesday in July next; and they will continue to be held at all\r\n  those places on the first and third Tuesdays in each month, until\r\n  after the first Tuesday in November next; when such other arrangements\r\n  as may be made by the government will be announced.\r\n\r\n  “Information can be obtained respecting the lands to be disposed of in\r\n  the several districts, by applying to the following gentlemen, agents\r\n  for the commissioners of crown lands, viz.:\r\n\r\n  “In the Bathurst district, Mr John M‘Naughton, D.S. Bytown.\r\n\r\n  “In the eastern district, James Pringle, Esquire, Cornwall.\r\n\r\n  “In the Newcastle district, Alexander M^cDonell, Esquire,\r\n  Peterborough.\r\n\r\n  “In the London district, Roswell Mount, Esquire, Delaware.\r\n\r\n  “In the western district, Henry John Jones, Esquire, Chatham.\r\n\r\n  “The commissioner for crown lands, acting also as agent for the sale\r\n  of clergy reserves, requests it to be noticed, that such clergy\r\n  reserves as have not been hitherto occupied by authority, or leased by\r\n  the government, will be disposed of, by public auction only, either at\r\n  the periodical sales of crown lands or at occasional sales, to be duly\r\n  advertised; and that the terms of payment for clergy reserves will\r\n  continue to be as follows:—Ten per cent to be paid at the time of\r\n  sale, and the remainder in nine annual instalments of ten per cent\r\n  each, with interest on each instalment, to be paid with the instalment\r\n\r\n  “Such clergy reserves as have been leased, or occupied by the\r\n  authority of the government, must be applied for by letter to the\r\n  Commissioner of Crown Lands, and when disposed of, will be sold by\r\n  private sale on the same terms of payment as those disposed of by\r\n  public auction.\r\n\r\n  “All applications from emigrants, or respecting emigration, not\r\n  immediately connected with the sale of public lands, are to be\r\n  addressed to ANTHONY B.

The same\r\nadvertisement announces clergy reserves, on condition of actual\r\nsettlement, ten per cent of the price paid at the time of sale, and the\r\nremainder at nine annual instalments, with interest of six per cent on\r\neach instalment.\r\n\r\nEast of Bear Creek—17s. 6d. and the remainder 10s. The township of\r\nChatham, 15s.; Madoc, 7s. 6d.; London, 15s. per acre, Halifax currency.\r\n\r\nThe mode of disposing of crown lands has been subject of frequent\r\ncomplaint by newly arrived emigrants, and the whole system merits\r\ncensure. I met individuals who had travelled more than one hundred miles\r\nfrom York to examine lands in the west, and returned again to York to\r\npetition and make interest with the authorities to get certain lots put\r\nup for sale. When they succeeded, they had to live in idleness for a\r\nmonth until the day of sale arrived, and again travel to the place of\r\nsale. Sometimes applications to have lands put up for sale are\r\nfrustrated, and rather than suffer delay and dance attendance on men of\r\ninfluence, many people have passed into the United States, where a\r\nperson can go to the land-office of the district and fix on any lot\r\nwhich pleases him. There cash is the only interest that can be employed,\r\nand its non-payment the only delay to settlement.\r\n\r\nPaying the purchase-money by instalments induces people without capital\r\nto become purchasers, who, for the interest of themselves and the\r\ncommunity, ought to have assisted others in clearing and cultivating\r\nland, until they had accumulated sufficient capital, by saving, to\r\npurchase without credit. To the system of disposing of land by credit,\r\nmuch of the wretchedness and poverty of the present Canadian landholders\r\nmay be justly attributed. The experience of the United States government\r\ndemonstrated this, and a law was passed to abolish credit on the price\r\nof land. How difficult it seems to be for Britain to adopt legislation\r\nto the existing age of the world!\r\n\r\nThe Canada Company possess immense tracts of country, and sell land on\r\nterms similar to government, giving credit and drawbacks to induce\r\npeople to purchase. The price of the company’s land at Goderich is 7s.\r\n6d. per acre, and equal to the price of crown lands in other parts.\r\n\r\nMuch land is held by absentee proprietors, or the members of the party\r\nwho sway the councils of the province. It is commonly in the hands of\r\nagents empowered to sell. The prices are generally higher than crown\r\nlands, and credit unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of British emigrants, arriving in Canada without\r\nfunds and the most exalted ideas of the value and productiveness of\r\nland, purchase extensively on credit, and take up their abode in the\r\nmidst of the forest, with the proudest feelings of independence, and in\r\nthe confident hope of meeting their engagements, and becoming fine\r\ngentlemen at the end of a few years. Every thing goes on well for a\r\nshort time. A log-house is erected with the assistance of old settlers,\r\nand the clearing of forest is commenced. Credit is obtained at a\r\nneighbouring store, and at length it is found necessary to work a day or\r\ntwo in the week for hire to obtain food for the family. The few garden\r\nstuffs and field crops, grown the first year, produce little for want of\r\na free circulation of air, and the imperfect manner in which they had\r\nbeen sown. Should fever and ague now visit the emigrant, which is\r\nfrequently the case, the situation of himself and family, enfeebled by\r\ndisease, is truly wretched. Hope is, however, still bright, and he\r\nstruggles through the second year, with better crops and prospects than\r\nthe preceding one. The third year brings him good crops, which furnish a\r\nsupply of food for his establishment. During this period he has led a\r\nlife of toil and privation, being poorly fed and most uncomfortably\r\nlodged. But the thoughts of owning so many fair acres has been a\r\nnever-failing source of joy and sweetener of life. On arrival of the\r\nfourth harvest, he is reminded by the storekeeper to pay his account\r\nwith cash, or discharge part of it with his disposable produce, for\r\nwhich he gets a very small price. He is also informed that the\r\npurchase-money of the land has been accumulating with interest. The\r\nphantom of prosperity, conjured up by his imagination, is now dispelled,\r\nand, on calmly looking into his affairs, he finds himself poorer than\r\nwhen he commenced operations. Disappointment preys on his spirits, and\r\nthe aid of whisky is perhaps sought to raise them. The hopelessness of\r\nhis situation renders him indolent and immoral. The land ultimately\r\nreverts to the former proprietor, or a new purchaser is found.\r\n\r\nTo render the situation of an emigrant purchasing without capital more\r\nevident, his case shall be illustrated by figures. Suppose 200 acres,\r\nwhich is the common size of lots purchased, at 15s., and that the\r\nemigrant has the means of maintaining himself without working for hire,\r\nand continues in good health. The three first crops being required to\r\nfeed the family and obtain necessaries, he may be supposed to have\r\nnearly thirty acres in crop the fourth year, if he has been very\r\nindustrious, but making allowance for stumps, fences, and roads, the\r\nactual surface in crop will not exceed twenty acres. At this time, near\r\nthe end of the fifth year, when the fourth crop is reaped, the\r\npurchase-money, and interest on it, will amount to about L.200. The\r\ninterest of this sum at the rate of the country is L.12, and a burden on\r\nthe land in crop of more than 10s. an acre, which it cannot meet. In\r\nthis estimate there is no return made for forest land, which is\r\ngenerally as unproductive of grass as the surface of the sea. It is the\r\nquantity of land purchased which operates so unfavourably on the\r\nsettler. If, in the case chosen for illustration, 50 had been purchased\r\ninstead of 200 acres, the result would have been very different. It is\r\nseldom a person depending on his labour clears and cultivates more than\r\n40 acres in course of his life. Therefore 50 acres is a sufficient\r\nextent for such a character to buy, and under no circumstances ought he\r\nto exceed 100 acres.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the purchase-money has been paid, the settler finds\r\nhimself but indifferently off, and generally indebted to storekeepers.\r\nIt must, however, be kept in view, that the land which has been cleared\r\nis of considerable value, and at the end of the fifth or sixth year, an\r\nindustrious man may have his property worth much more money than he paid\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThere is never any hesitation in selling land to a man without capital,\r\nas the rights of it are withheld. Every tree which is cut down enhances\r\nthe value of the property, which is unproductive while they are\r\nstanding. When a settler absconds after some years’ residence, a case by\r\nno means rare, the proprietor derives great advantage from his\r\noperations. An agent to a very extensive and wild property, informed me\r\nhe had sold twenty-five lots of land, consisting of about 6000 acres,\r\nand received in all of purchase-money L.300.\r\n\r\nIf the sketch which I have given of settlers without capital is thought\r\nto be overdrawn, from the fact of so many individuals having become\r\nprosperous, let it be remembered that land was formerly granted on\r\npaying fees of office, and without purchase. The system of selling land\r\non credit, and contracting debt at stores, hath proved ruinous of late\r\nyears to settlers without capital, who have no other means of\r\nextricating themselves than selling their properties.\r\n\r\nIn almost every district people are found anxious to sell land, and\r\nsmall farms may be bought on cheaper terms than lands belonging to the\r\ncrown, Canada Company, or large proprietors, more especially if cash is\r\npaid. Indeed the necessities of many people are so urgent, and credit so\r\ngeneral, that an individual with cash in his pocket may drive a good\r\nbargain at all times.\r\n\r\nIn a country of such diversity of soil, climate, and situation as Upper\r\nCanada, the price of land in its territory must be extremely variable,\r\nand will be found to run from 2s. 6d. to L.6 per acre. On a general\r\nview, it is cheapest in the southern part of the western district, when\r\nclimate and soil are taken into consideration. Few settlers have located\r\nthemselves of late years in this part of the country, and trade can\r\nscarcely be said to have travelled so far west in Canada.\r\nSteam-navigation will, however, soon alter the present state of things\r\nin this quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen the extent of unoccupied surface, the extent of soil which is\r\noccupied and remaining uncleared, and the tens of millions of acres\r\nwhich have never been surveyed, are considered, the price of Canadian\r\nland is extravagantly high, and far above its intrinsic value to actual\r\nsettlers. Land, like other things, is cheap or dear by comparison,\r\ngovernment land in the United States being sold at 6s. 3d. Halifax\r\ncurrency, ready-money, ought to make the British government blush for\r\nits policy in Canada. The price of land surrendered by the Six Nations,\r\nand covered with forest, is fixed at 15s. per acre, which is more than\r\ndouble the price of government land in the western United States,\r\nsuperior in quality, situated in a finer climate, clothed with luxuriant\r\ngrass, and without an obstacle to immediate cultivation. The credit,\r\nwith accumulating interest on the price of land in Canada, is\r\npractically an evil to the purchaser and the country. It is population\r\nalone which imparts value to land, and a more effectual method could not\r\nbe devised for preventing a farther influx of inhabitants to Upper\r\nCanada, and draining away many of those already settled, than government\r\nadhering to the present upset prices of land.\r\n\r\nThe want of information which could be relied on regarding the United\r\nStates, and the praises lavished on Upper Canada by interested parties,\r\nhas drawn a number of emigrants to this district of late years. The\r\nstream of emigration has, however, begun to take a different course, and\r\nthe price of land in Canada will tend to steady its direction. It is a\r\nknowledge of the Western States, joined to their pecuniary difficulties,\r\nwhich makes so many farmers anxious to sell their properties. The late\r\nrise in the price of land operates as an inducement for enterprising\r\nindividuals to leave the province, and already some of them yearly take\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nBut the whole system of settling land in Canada has been bad for many\r\nyears. The retention of two-sevenths of the land for crown and clergy\r\nreserves, retarded improvement of every description, and granting\r\nimmense tracts to favourites of government increased the evil. Bestowing\r\ngrants of 200 acres by favour of government, or private individuals,\r\nprevented settlers choosing situations for themselves, and they were\r\noften directed to unfavourable parts of the country, with a view perhaps\r\nof enhancing the value of properties in the neighbourhood. A lot of 200\r\nacres of forest land was too great an extent to grant unconditionally to\r\nsettlers, without capital, as experience proves they seldom clear 50\r\nacres with aid of a family. From these causes the province may be said\r\nto be overrun instead of having been settled,—the evils of a\r\nforest-covered surface perpetuated, and the good effects which result\r\nfrom concentration and unity of population effectually retarded.\r\n\r\nIt might now perhaps be difficult to remedy the state of things. A tax\r\nought to be levied on forest-land above a specified extent, to check\r\nspeculation in land, and induce large landholders to sell or improve\r\ntheir possessions. Land ought to be sold cheap, in small lots, for ready\r\nmoney, on condition of actual settlement and annually clearing a certain\r\nextent. The Canada Company ought to be got rid of, or forced to dispose\r\nof its land at fixed prices, and on stipulated conditions. Britain, in\r\nlegislating for Upper Canada, should do justice to the colonists and the\r\nhome subjects who may wish to emigrate. But in all likelihood she does\r\nnot now possess the power of carrying proper views into effect. The land\r\nof the province being held at a monopoly price, operates as a barrier to\r\nBritish emigration, and is a tax on the industrious who reach the\r\nprovince, principally for the benefit of absentees.\r\n\r\nMuch as Upper Canada appears to me to have been misgoverned, her evils\r\nare not likely soon to end. The properties of a great portion of the\r\nindustrious farmers are either mortgaged to storekeepers or capitalists,\r\nand almost the whole of the influential inhabitants are interested in\r\nland. The men filling official situations generally having large\r\nestates, the managers of the Canada Company, and of other extensive\r\ntracts of land, will oppose, from selfishness, the introduction of a\r\nbetter system, and endeavour to perpetuate the present state of things.\r\nI had little opportunity of judging if the inhabitants are fit to govern\r\nthemselves. They will, however, find it a most arduous task to get rid\r\nof the present party in power, and a separation from the mother country\r\nwould, in all probability lessen their chance. Upper Canada is likely to\r\nseparate from Britain in seeking to retain monopolies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  _Productions—Agricultural Societies—Want of Pasturage—Progress of\r\n    Forest Settlement—First Crops on Forest Land—Worn-out Soil—Mildewed\r\n    Wheat—Misrepresentations of Canada—Mr Ferguson’s Statement—Township\r\n    of Nichol—Praises and Detractions—Choosing a situation—Advantages\r\n    and disadvantages of Upper Canada for different Emigrants—State of\r\n    the Inhabitants—Constitution—Game._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe productions of the country are various, and embrace almost every\r\nthing that is desirable in life. Wheat is the staple commodity. Indian\r\ncorn ripens well in the most southerly parts, but is not extensively\r\ncultivated any where, and, in the present state of the country, is an\r\nuncertain crop beyond 41½ degrees of latitude. Oats, rye, barley, peas,\r\nand millet, number amongst the grains. Tobacco, turnips, potatoes,\r\nmelons, apples, pears, and peaches, amongst the vegetables and fruits.\r\nThe climate of the southern parts is genial, the industry of man applied\r\nto the cultivation of the soil renders it fruitful.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of Upper Canada has not been reduced to a system in the\r\noldest cultivated parts, and is carried on in the rudest manner in\r\nrecently settled districts. The legislature having lately appropriated\r\nL.100 to each district for the encouragement of agriculture, societies\r\nhave been formed for this purpose in Niagara and other districts. I am\r\npossessed of a copy of the Niagara District Agricultural Society’s\r\nrules, and its exertions will, in all likelihood, be directed to the\r\nimprovement of stock.\r\n\r\nIn all countries perhaps, and more especially in one covered with dense\r\nforests like Upper Canada, the first efforts of the inhabitants are\r\ndirected to the growing of grain for their own subsistence, and pastural\r\nagriculture is introduced at a later period. This course of farming\r\nmust, of necessity, have been followed in Canada, as the forest does not\r\nyield a single blade of grass, which is owing, perhaps, to the rays of\r\nthe sun being excluded from the surface of the earth throughout the\r\nwhole season, by winter’s snow, the foliage of summer, and the fallen\r\nleaves of autumn. The severity of winter would also retard the keeping\r\nof animals, as an artificial supply of food and shelter is necessary to\r\ntheir existence. So defective is the pastoral farming of Upper Canada,\r\nthat almost every town or village of magnitude in the district is\r\ndependent on the United States for the sheep and cattle which are\r\nslaughtered for the use of the inhabitants. Mr Somerville of Whitby\r\naccounted for this, on the ground, that all oxen reared in the country\r\nwere required by new settlers to plough the soil. It is, however, quite\r\nevident, that there is not a sufficient extent of cleared surface on\r\nalmost any farm to graze breeding stock, and provide them with proper\r\nfood for winter. The rearing and fatting of animals in Canada must\r\nrequire such a division of labour as did not come under my notice while\r\nin the country, and the time has scarcely arrived when it can be\r\nsuccessfully adopted. The animals of every kind are of an inferior\r\ndescription, and no great improvement can be effected with them until\r\nproper winter food and shelter are supplied. The working oxen are\r\nchiefly obtained from the States.\r\n\r\nMost new settlers find difficulty in providing pasturage for their milch\r\ncows; and butter made from the cream of animals roaming in the forest is\r\noften of the worst quality. I have been at the residence of settlers who\r\ncould not produce butter of their own manufacturing at table in the\r\nfourth year of their farming. The want of grass is one of the greatest\r\nprivations of first settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the old cultivated districts manure is sometimes applied to land.\r\nGypsum is frequently used successfully to clover and Indian corn, and\r\nProvidence seems to have provided most of the districts composed of sand\r\nwith an inexhaustible store of gypsum, to which soils it is chiefly\r\napplicable. I could not learn that lime had been tried. The robbing\r\nsystem hath long been followed, and its effects are every where\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe progress of bush or forest settlement admits of little choice. After\r\na log-house hath been erected, the trees are cut down with an axe, about\r\nthree feet from the ground, the branches are lopped off and the trunks\r\nchopped into lengths of about fifteen feet, piled together, and burnt.\r\nThe piling, or logging, as it is called, is by far the most arduous part\r\nof the process, requiring the aid of several men and oxen. The burning\r\ncannot be effected but in dry weather, and I learned considerable\r\nimportance was attached to a clean or effectual burning. The ground is\r\nthen fenced by means of rails, split from logs by an axe, and piled\r\nabove each other—the whole country being considered common when not\r\nproperly fenced. The ground is then sown with wheat, or planted with\r\nIndian corn, or some other crop, and the harrow passed over the ground,\r\nit being impracticable to use the plough for the stumps and roots of\r\ntrees. At the expiry of seven years, the stumps are found to be decayed,\r\nand the plough may then be employed. From the time of clearing, the land\r\nmay have been cropped by means of the harrow, or employed in producing\r\ngrass. There is little room for the display of genius or management, the\r\nprocess being nearly the same in all cases.\r\n\r\nFrom the ashes of the timber a great deal of potash was at one time\r\nmade, and sent to Britain; but a substitute having been found for this\r\ncommodity, the ashes are generally spread on the ground, and sometimes,\r\nwhen the land is too rich, they are removed for manure to another part\r\nof the farm. When soil is viewed as a workshop, laying prostrate the\r\nmembers of the forest must be a cheering employment to the contemplative\r\nlandowner. Being of no value in its original state, every sunbeam which\r\ndarts on the surface, by removal of the trees, is assurance of imparted\r\nfertility, and never-ending productiveness; and as the light streams in\r\nfrom heaven, his heart will be filled with gratitude to God, and his arm\r\nnerved for new exertion. But the chopping of timber is a most laborious\r\ntask to one unaccustomed to handle the axe, and the person possessed of\r\na little capital had better pay others for clearing land, than attempt\r\nit himself on a large scale. To clear a farm out of the midst of the\r\nforest, by personal exertion, requires such an iron constitution and\r\nstrength of arm as few British agriculturists of middle age possess.\r\nMany individuals who make the attempt excavate a small space, that may\r\nbe termed an hospital, which ultimately becomes their graveyard.\r\n\r\nI experienced disappointment at crops on newly cleared land being so\r\nindifferent, having been led to suppose they were generally too\r\nluxuriant. Believing every vegetable substance to be composed of the\r\nsame elements, and reduceable by decay, so as to enter into new\r\ncombinations, I fancied the soil the very essence of fertility, from\r\nhaving been enriched with the decaying leaves of many centuries. If all\r\nthe woody fibre of the forest and vegetable mould which covers the\r\nsurface could be at once decomposed, my anticipated fertility would be\r\nrealized. But in burning the trees, fire passes over the entire surface,\r\nand consumes almost every particle of vegetable matter. The agency of\r\nfire, joined to the imperfect tilling of the soil, will sufficiently\r\naccount for the want of luxuriance in first crops, which may generally\r\nbe considered a fortunate circumstance, when a free circulation of air\r\nis prevented.\r\n\r\nSettlers have often been cautioned against purchasing what is termed\r\nworn-out soil, timbered land being preferable. This appears to me to be\r\none of the many deceptions used to entrap the unwary emigrant into the\r\nwilderness. I have already observed the first crops are not luxuriant\r\nafter clearing the forest. The first wheat crop is, however, the best\r\none until the stumps decay, when the soil will afterwards improve with\r\ngood management. The most productive wheat crops, combining quantity and\r\nquality, are found on the oldest cultivated soils. Much soil hath been\r\nabandoned to nature after being cleared, not owing, however, to its\r\nhaving become exhausted, but to its natural inferiority. It is better to\r\nrestore the most exhausted soil than clear forest land of the same\r\nquality. Nature never becomes exhausted, and the farmer has only to do\r\nhis part in order to obtain her bounty.\r\n\r\nIn course of my tour in North America, I was particular in my enquiries\r\nregarding mildewed wheat, knowing how destructive the disease is to that\r\ngrain, as well as to others visited by it. Many growing crops and\r\nbundles of straw of the previous year’s growth were examined, and the\r\nresult of my observations tended to strengthen the opinions I had formed\r\nof the origin and localities of its effects.\r\n\r\nMildew appears to me to result from frost, produced by the radiation of\r\nheat, rupturing the sap-vessels, and the moisture which exudes being\r\nfavourable to the germination of the seeds of the fungus which grows on\r\nthe straw of the plant, and checks the filling of the grain. It has been\r\nestablished by repeated experiment, that in certain states of the\r\natmosphere, cold, within the limits of freezing, takes place on the\r\nsurface of the earth when the temperature, at an elevation of a few\r\nfeet, is ten or twelve degrees warmer. This is beautifully explained in\r\n“Wells’ Essay on Dew,” which I recommend to farmers wishing to become\r\nacquainted with atmospheric effects on vegetation. The natural agency\r\nfavourable to the radiation of heat, or production of cold, is a clear\r\nsky and still atmosphere. The luxuriance of crops is a predisposing\r\ncause to a visitation of mildew, from the breadth, colour, and\r\nsucculency of the foliage.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1830, I made an attempt to prove the correctness of my\r\nopinions regarding mildew by experiment. My apparatus, which was of the\r\nsimplest kind, was often exposed; but the difficulty of catching a\r\nfavourable atmosphere rendered all my attempts unsatisfactory; but some\r\nof my observations with the thermometer were remarkable. On the 19th\r\nAugust, at eight o’clock in the evening, a delicate thermometer, on\r\nFahrenheit’s scale, at four feet from the ground, indicated 45°; and a\r\nsimilar one, immediately below the other, exposed on the surface of the\r\ngrass, 38°; and at half-past eight, respectively, 47° and 43°, the wind\r\nhaving risen in the interval. Next morning, at four o’clock, the\r\nthermometers stood at 38° and 35°; and another, enclosed in a\r\nglass-case, and exposed on the outside of a window, at 45°. At five\r\no’clock, the thermometer, four feet from the ground, indicated 34°, and\r\nthe one on the grass, 30½°. The thermometer at the window remained\r\nunaltered, and, being removed from the case, was placed with the other\r\ntwo on a piece of lodged spring-sown wheat. At a quarter past five, all\r\nthe three indicated 29¾°. The sun was then a little above the horizon,\r\nand obscured by a small cloud; the sky was clear, the air still, and\r\nmild to human feeling. In the same situation, the thermometers, at eight\r\no’clock, indicated 55°, and at two P. M. 75°. At ten in the evening, the\r\nthermometer, four feet from the ground, stood at 44°, and the one on the\r\ngrass, at 42°. At half-past four on the morning of the 21st, the\r\nthermometer, four feet from the ground, stood at 34°, one on the grass,\r\nat 28¾°, and one on the wheat, at 29°. The thermometers on the grass and\r\nwheat were thinly coated with ice, and the morning was clear and\r\nagreeable. The formation of dew was not very copious on either of the\r\nmornings, and my reapers made no remark about cold or frost when\r\nhandling the grain. The field of spring-sown wheat, already mentioned,\r\nand one of barley, were at this time in a green state, and very\r\npromising; but the grain made no farther improvement, and mildew\r\nappeared on both crops in a day or two afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not been able to produce mildew by artificial means, the\r\nobservations made with the thermometers in 1830 almost amount to a\r\ndemonstration of its origin. Every case of mildew, whether general or\r\npartial, in a district, may be accounted for by cold produced by the\r\nradiation of heat, coupled with the state of the crops; and the\r\nhypothesis has been strongly supported by Scottish writers on practical\r\nhusbandry, Brown and Aiton, while recording, as the cause of mildew,\r\nnatural phenomena which result from or generally accompany the radiation\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\nBut from whatever cause mildew may proceed, there is no question of the\r\nwheat crop, throughout a considerable extent of North America, being\r\nliable to its effects. Many instances of mildew are recorded in my tour;\r\nand I scarcely passed through a district, the surface of which consisted\r\nof sudden undulations, or small forest clearances, where the wheat was\r\nnot seriously injured by it. Some accounts which I have received from\r\nparts of Upper Canada for 1834, allude to the destruction of wheat by\r\nfrost. In all partially cleared parts of Upper Canada, with exception\r\nperhaps of situations on the margins of lakes, wheat will suffer from\r\nmildew. The want of success which so often attends first crops on small\r\nclearances in the midst of the forest, is in all probability owing to\r\nthe frosts of spring, summer, and autumn, caused by the radiation of\r\nheat, and which a free circulation of air will alone prevent. This\r\ncasualty is a serious evil to first settlers, and ought to form part of\r\ntheir calculations in choosing a situation.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada has been much overrated by some people who have visited the\r\ncountry. Many of the written accounts may be regarded as advertisements;\r\nand the statements have been the means of deceiving the unwary. During\r\nmy sojourn in the province, I frequently heard Mr Adam Fergusson of\r\nWoodhill become the subject of reproach; and this season, the clamour is\r\nloud against him. A correspondent states in one of his letters,—“Many\r\nextravagant notions of America are entertained at home. Some people will\r\nform such notions in spite of any writing; but certainly many absurd\r\nthings have been published about America by individuals who have\r\ntravelled through the country without mixing with the people, or who\r\nseem to have written from interested motives. I know not how the\r\nHighland Society of Scotland will like to hear of Mr Fergusson’s errors.\r\nIts patronage certainly tended to mislead many. I have met with people\r\nin this part of the world who told me so, and who rail against him at a\r\ngreat rate.”\r\n\r\nI agree with my correspondent in thinking the patronage which the\r\nHighland Society bestowed on Mr Fergusson added weight to his\r\nstatements, and some of its members will feel disappointed at hearing\r\nthem called in question. Societies, however, like individuals, often\r\nmisplace confidence, and spurn the advances of real merit. But his most\r\nobjectionable matter is contained in “Practical Notes made during a\r\nSecond Visit to Canada in 1833,” with which the Highland Society is not\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nMr Adam Fergusson of Woodhill occupied a respectable, and perhaps an\r\nelevated, place in Scotland. He was understood to be a leading director\r\nin one of the first agricultural societies in the world, and acted\r\nconspicuously in the public matters of Perthshire, one of the most\r\nimportant counties of his native country. He was considered to have a\r\ncompetent knowledge of agriculture, and to be a person deserving of\r\ncredit. But his character renders the statements he has put forth more\r\nmischievous, and their exposure more necessary. To have censured Mr\r\nFergusson’s statements would have been painful to my feelings under any\r\ncircumstances, and is especially so at present, when he is so far\r\nremoved. It is, however, a duty I owe my countrymen to be candid, and\r\nthey shall be allowed an opportunity of judging of our sentiments on\r\nCanadian farming.\r\n\r\nAfter stating he has purchased a block of 7000 acres in the township of\r\nNichol, he adds, “In reference to the capabilities of Nichol, I offer\r\nwith some confidence the following calculations.

The chief error consists in clearing land, sowing\r\nit with wheat, and reaping the crop in the first year, which is an\r\nimpossibility. The same error is repeated in the fourth year. Thus four\r\ninstead of three crops are reaped in the time specified. I am aware that\r\nland has been let to be cleared, on condition of not being paid for\r\nuntil after a crop has been reaped. Mr Fergusson cannot, however, escape\r\nfrom his error on this account, because he does not mention the\r\ncircumstance, and the cost of clearing being very low, is entered along\r\nwith the purchase-money of the land, the building of the house, and\r\nhousehold expenses of the first year. Three successive crops of wheat\r\nare taken from the first cleared portion of the ground, without a\r\nfalling off in the crop, which is an absurdity, and such a mode of\r\ncropping is almost never had recourse to. He has omitted the expense of\r\nthrashing and marketing his crops, and also, sometimes, seed for sowing,\r\nall of which may appear trifles to the writer of “_Practical Notes_,”\r\nalthough of consequence to a farmer. He stocks with animals and servants\r\nin the “third year.” The former must be valuable creatures, for they\r\nlive without food, at least the whole produce is charged as sold. But\r\nthe servants are superior to the animals, as they seem to live on air,\r\nand refuse wages—the household, harvest, and other expenses in the\r\nfourth year, when the crop consists of 100 acres of wheat, do not\r\ngreatly exceed the same charges in the second year, when there is 87½\r\nacres in wheat, and no servants engaged. The farm is not stocked until\r\nthe third year, but a team of oxen is charged in the second, which,\r\nperhaps, ought to have been written cows, as these necessary animals are\r\nnot mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr Fergusson’s calculations do not appear accurate, and scarcely\r\nintelligible in the way he has given them. They shall, therefore, be\r\narranged, without altering his data, as they would actually occur. The\r\nentries marked with asterisks are new, and indispensable in practice.\r\n\r\n                               FIRST YEAR.\r\n Purchase-money of 200 acres, at $ 4,           L.200  0  0\r\n\r\n A log-house,                                      50  0  0\r\n\r\n Some furniture for a log-house,                   20  0  0\r\n\r\n Barn, including stable and cow-house,             50  0  0\r\n\r\n Household expenses, two entries,                  76  0  0\r\n\r\n Clear, fence, and sow, 50 acres with wheat,\r\n   at L.4,                                        200  0  0\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECOND YEAR.\r\n Clear, fence, and sow 37½ acres with wheat,\r\n   at L.4,                                        150  0  0\r\n\r\n Oxen, and household expenses,                     50  0  0\r\n\r\n Household and other expenses,                     39  8  4\r\n\r\n Expense of harvesting,                            35 10  0\r\n\r\n Seed for 50 acres of wheat, cleared the first\r\n   year,   and sown again the second, at 4s.\r\n   6d.                                             11  5  0\r\n\r\n * Harrowing and sowing,                           12 10  0\r\n\r\n * Threshing the crop, ⅑th of 1250 bushels, or\r\n   140 bushels, at 4s. 6d.                         31 10  0\r\n\r\n * Teaming to lake Ontario 1110 bushels, at\r\n   9d.                                             41 12  6\r\n\r\n Crop, 50 acres of wheat will yield 25 bushels\r\n   per acre, and sell at 4s. 6d. per bushel,                 L.281  5  0\r\n\r\n At the end of the second year L.967, 15s.\r\n   10d. has been expended, and L.281 received.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THIRD YEAR.\r\n Stocking the farm, and servants’ wages and\r\n   board,                                         285  0  0\r\n\r\n Grass seeds for 25 acres, at 3s.                   3 15  0\r\n\r\n Assistance during harvest,                        20  0  0\r\n\r\n Household and other expenses, two entries,        89  5  0\r\n\r\n Assistance in threshing,                          35  0  0\r\n\r\n * Seed for 37½ acres, at 4s. 6d.                   8  8  9\r\n\r\n Crop, 87½ acres of wheat will yield as\r\n   formerly,                                                   492  0  0\r\n\r\n At the end of the third year L.1408, 8s. 9d.\r\n   has been expended, and L.773, 5s. received.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOURTH YEAR.\r\n Clears, fences, and sows, 62½ acres, at L.4,     250  0  0\r\n\r\n Erects a thrashing-machine,                       80  0  0\r\n\r\n Builds some houses for feeding stock,             20  0  0\r\n\r\n Household and other expenses, two entries,       112 10  0\r\n\r\n Sundry improvements about the house,              40  0  0\r\n\r\n * Seed for 25 acres, in turnip and potatoes,      15  0  0\r\n\r\n Crop, 37½ acres wheat at former rate,                         210 18  9\r\n\r\n 50 do. grass, valued at                                       120  0  0\r\n\r\n                                               —————— —— ——\r\n\r\n                                               L.1926 15  7 L.1104  3  9\r\n\r\n\r\n At the end of the fourth year the landowner\r\n   is minus,                                                 L.822 11 10\r\n\r\n                                                            ====== == ==\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the farmer become better after the fourth year, and on\r\nthe assumed data he would soon become wealthy. At the end of the fourth\r\nyear, when the land has been cleared, the farm, with buildings,\r\nfurniture, stocking, and 100 acres of growing wheat, may be valued at\r\nL.1200. By the original statement the fourth crop has been reaped, in\r\nwhich case the farm, with buildings, stocking, and furniture, may be\r\nvalued at L.750. According to my way of arranging Mr Fergusson’s\r\nstatement, the purchaser of 200 acres of land at the end of the fourth\r\nyear is only worth L.427, 8s. 2d., or a loser of L.172, 11s. 10d. By the\r\noriginal statement he is worth L.1400, or a gainer of L.800 above his\r\ncapital of L.600, after maintaining himself and family. Mr Fergusson’s\r\nstatement of Canadian farming, like the Marquis of Londonderry’s\r\napplication to Lord Liverpool, may be marked with the words “_too bad!_”\r\n\r\nWith due deference to Mr Fergusson’s practical knowledge, I may remark,\r\nthat he seems to have forgotten the part of the world in which Nichol is\r\nsituated when framing his statement. How are people to be obtained for\r\nthinning turnip in the midst of a forest country, and who is to tend his\r\nthrashing-machine?\r\n\r\nThe data of an agricultural statement must be very fluctuating at all\r\ntimes, as the influence of the season affects the quantity and quality\r\nof produce, and consequently prices. Mr Fergusson assumes 25 bushels of\r\nwheat per acre as the produce of new cleared land, but the results of my\r\nenquiries and observation, including chance of mildew and imperfect\r\ncultivation from stumps, do not warrant their being rated higher than 18\r\nbushels per acre. It appears odd that he should fix the price of wheat\r\nin Nichol at 4s. 6d., when he quotes the Niagara price at 4s. 3d., and\r\nit would require 9d. per bushel to bring wheat from Nichol to Lake\r\nOntario, where it would meet the same market as Niagara. At the time he\r\nwrote, Nichol wheat could not be worth more than 3s. 6d. per bushel,\r\nHalifax currency. But the price of wheat in Canada is regulated by the\r\nprices of Britain. The expense of sending wheat from Nichol to Britain,\r\nby way of the St Lawrence, including ensurance, freight, merchant’s\r\nprofit, and many other charges, will amount to nearly 4s. 3d., Halifax\r\ncurrency, per bushel, and it may be worth in London 7s. 3d., which makes\r\nwheat worth about 3s. at Nichol.\r\n\r\nHaving exposed Mr Fergusson’s statement, one of my own may perhaps be\r\nexpected, but nothing satisfactory of the sort can be framed. The\r\nexpense of clearing, fencing, and sowing, depends on the nature of the\r\ntimber, and varies from L.3, 10s. to L.5 per acre. The succeeding wheat\r\ncrop, also, varies from 12 to 25 bushels per acre, and prices from 1s.\r\n6d. to 5s. per bushel. Generally speaking, money is not rapidly made by\r\nclearing forest land, while patient industry seldom fails of being\r\nultimately remunerated.\r\n\r\nThe township of Nichol is not, however, such a situation as I would make\r\nchoice of, being situated too far to the north, and too distant from\r\nwater-carriage. Supposing the carriage or teaming of wheat, as it is\r\ncalled in the language of the country, from Nichol to lake Ontario costs\r\n9d. per bushel, and that two successive wheat crops are taken from\r\nnewly-cleared land, yielding 20 bushels each per acre, the carriage of\r\nthe produce to market will amount to 30s., or double the price of what\r\nthe land is originally worth, and this charge will operate as a tax, or\r\nrent, on every crop that is raised afterwards. The distance from\r\nwater-conveyance, also, tends to render dear every imported commodity\r\nthat may be required. When the Ouse or Grand river is made navigable,\r\nNichol will be nearer water-carriage; but, at present, I would rather\r\npay a high price for land in a good situation and climate in Upper\r\nCanada, than take a present of land in Nichol, if I was bound to occupy\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe writers of private letters, the verbal tales of individuals, and the\r\npublic journals, are often called into requisition to laud and\r\nmisrepresent the country, and people of Britain ought to consider the\r\naccounts well before giving them credence. In a Montreal newspaper,\r\nwhich lately reached me, I observed a paragraph announcing that a yacht\r\nclub had been formed at Goderich, of which Captain Dunlop was president.\r\nAt the time of my visit to Goderich, in the end of August, 1833, the\r\npopulation were chiefly subsisting on flour and salt pork, imported from\r\nDetroit. The harbour contained three craft of the smallest size, and I\r\ndid not see a boat or yacht of any description. The youth of Britain,\r\nwho anticipates displaying at Goderich the uniform of a yacht club, and\r\nhaving the fair sex greeting his triumphant entry into the harbour by\r\nthe waving of handkerchiefs, may delay his departure for half a century.\r\nA steam-boat had appeared off the village in 1833, and could not gain\r\nadmittance into the harbour for want of water. I did not learn the\r\nobject of her call, but I am sure all the disposable agricultural\r\nproduce of the settlement, up to the present time, would not freight a\r\nnutshell.\r\n\r\nCaptain A——, in the township of Blenheim, was told by an agent of the\r\nCanada Company, that a stage-coach would convey himself and family from\r\nHamilton to the property he had purchased. No such conveyance existed.\r\nOn representing the imposition which had been practised on him to the\r\nmanagers at York, an abatement of price was offered. I saw the\r\ncorrespondence on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf Upper Canada has been too much praised on the one hand, it has also\r\nbeen unnecessarily cried down by some who are anxious to conceal their\r\nwant of industry, and endeavour to shift from themselves to the country\r\nthe cause of their return to Britain. Many people emigrate to America\r\nwho ought to have remained at home, having been inflated by the\r\nrepresentations of others and their own imaginations. I have often heard\r\nsuch characters rail against the province; and, on pressing one of them\r\nfor the reason of his dislike, was answered, “It could not afford a\r\nwell-cooked beef-steak.” They often lounge about villages, and are a\r\nmoral pest. Like the fox who lost his tail, they are anxious to involve\r\nothers in disgrace with themselves; and as most emigrants experience a\r\nfew weeks’ despondency on first arriving in the country, the society of\r\nthe idle and discontented ought to be avoided.\r\n\r\nA person will find considerable difficulty in choosing a lot of land in\r\nCanada. Nine-tenths of the population are interested, directly or\r\nindirectly, in the sale of land. The accounts he will receive are more\r\nlikely to mislead than instruct him; and, if possible, he ought to rely\r\non his own judgment in purchasing. When he has decided on the\r\nneighbourhood in which he would like to reside, let him look at all the\r\nproperties for sale, and take the best bargain. Most of the small\r\nlandowners, being deeply indebted, are anxious to sell partially cleared\r\nestates for ready money; and more favourable terms will be obtained from\r\nthem than the crown, Canada Company, or extensive proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe wheat of Upper Canada is sown in autumn, and greatly superior in\r\nquality to the wheat of the lower province. It embraces, however, a\r\nvariety of climates, and the quality of wheat improves as the southern\r\nboundary is ascended. In Montreal market, the wheat of the upper\r\nprovince sells from 10 to 20 per cent higher than the wheat of the\r\nneighbourhood, and what is grown in the extreme west is of most value.\r\n\r\nThe expense of transport from the upper to the lower province is not yet\r\nreduced to proper terms, especially from remote quarters. But, in a\r\ngeneral view, the improved quality of the wheat may be regarded as\r\ncovering the expense of sending it by water to Montreal, while the\r\nclimate will produce a greater quantity than the lower province. This\r\nmay perhaps hold good as far west as the Thames, but on passing that\r\nriver to the north, both the climate and distance of transport will\r\noperate in reducing the value of wheat.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada possesses many advantages to the farmer over the lower\r\nprovince. The winter being of shorter duration and less severe, he has\r\nmore time to prepare the soil. A greater variety of plants can be\r\ncultivated, and all of them will attain greater perfection. Animals have\r\na longer summer to fatten, and a shorter winter to pine. Less dry fodder\r\nis required for them, and it is more easily obtained. Succulent food\r\nmight be grown and preserved with greater ease. Still, Upper Canada is\r\nnot likely soon to become a stock country, both from the limited cleared\r\nsurface, and severity of winter. Indian corn, too, is not easily grown,\r\nexcept in the southern parts, and it seems to be the chief winter\r\nsupport of animals in America, where labour is high compared with\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding labour is high and prices low in Upper Canada, capital\r\nand labour may be better employed in cultivation than in the lower\r\nprovince, with exception of the vicinity of Montreal, from the great\r\nassistance nature affords. But much capital cannot at present be\r\nemployed in the cultivation or improvement of land, and perhaps no\r\nportion will yield profit without active personal superintendence and\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nA British farmer with cleared land would obtain labour to hire in almost\r\nany part of the country, and be enabled to afford good wages from the\r\nproduce. In many situations, however, he would find difficulty in\r\nobtaining a cash price, which is at present one of the greatest\r\ndrawbacks to the country. Barter is often had recourse to, and the\r\nfarmer being generally indebted to storekeepers, they make their own\r\nterms with him, and prey on his vitals. This state of things is,\r\nhowever, soon likely to change from competition; in the meantime, the\r\nneedy former is sadly imposed on. Labour cannot be divided as in\r\nBritain, and cultivation must be carried on in a rude manner. The\r\nfarmer, however, could find no difficulty in maintaining himself by his\r\nown exertions. With two days’ labour in the week on an average\r\nthroughout the season, he may lead a listless life, without domestic\r\ncomfort, or care, or anxiety of any kind, and dream of future riches\r\ntill the close of his existence. With industry, comforts, happiness, and\r\nwealth, would be his portion. With forest land the British farmer would\r\nbe sacrificed, unless in the prime of youth. In chopping, logging, and\r\nburning timber, he could not for a time render much assistance, and his\r\nprevious knowledge would be of little avail. The plough could not be\r\nused for seven or eight years. Cultivating merely with the harrow, and\r\nmowing with the cradle-scythe amongst blackened stumps, would ill accord\r\nwith his former habits. In such pursuits he would not, in all\r\nprobability, find happiness or wealth. The young man of ardour and\r\nperseverance, whose habits could be changed, is differently situated,\r\nand he may enter the forest with every prospect of success. It is the\r\nreturns from clearing forest land being distant, though certain, which\r\ngives youth great advantage over age, independent of his moral pliancy\r\nand physical strength.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural labourer of Upper Canada finds employment at good\r\nnominal wages during summer, but, instead of getting money, he is served\r\nwith an order on a neighbouring store, from which he obtains goods to\r\nthe amount, 20 or 30 per cent above real value. In winter his wages are\r\nreduced nearly one-half, or he engages in the clearing of forest, on\r\nterms of distant payment, and in the interim subsists on store credit.\r\nFrom seldom being paid in money, he sees the hopelessness of raising\r\nhimself by purchasing land, and the disappointment often leads to\r\ndrunkenness. At present, it appears to me doubtful if the British\r\nagricultural labourer of middle age would greatly better his condition\r\nby removing to Upper Canada. It is certain he would obtain more of the\r\ngood things of life at a sacrifice of some little comfort, and unless he\r\nhas strong attraction to the country, it is scarcely worth his while to\r\nmake the change.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said manufacturers and artisans of all kinds make\r\nbetter Canadian farmers than agriculturists do. This seems to me part of\r\nthe deception which has been played off on the people of Britain.\r\nKnowledge is power in all things, and however prejudiced agriculturists\r\nmay be, their acquaintance with the time and mode of sowing, harvesting,\r\nand many etceteras, must give them advantages over other classes. I can\r\nconceive few situations more trying than a person without capital,\r\ntotally unacquainted with farming, placed in the midst of a forest to\r\nlive by his own exertions.\r\n\r\nThe man without capital ought to consider well before engaging with\r\nforest land, however cheap and advantageous the terms may appear. Almost\r\nall who do so can scarcely avoid being ruined, if interest is to be paid\r\non the stipulated price. At page 363, I have supposed a new settler in\r\nthe forest to have thirty acres in crop the fourth year. But when all\r\nthings are taken into consideration, it is found that a settler,\r\nunaccustomed to chop wood, does not generally clear more than six acres\r\nin a year, and attend to other necessary things. Under these\r\ncircumstances, it will be impossible for him to spare a fraction of\r\nmoney to pay interest or principal for the first five or six years. This\r\nis rendered evident also by the consideration, that the first crop of\r\nwheat does not, by the most favourable calculation, even pay the expense\r\nof clearing the forest and cultivating the soil. It is therefore\r\ndemonstrated, that clearing forest is at first unprofitable to a person\r\nwithout capital, if he had the land for nothing, and that every acre\r\nwhich he clears is at an immediate loss. The cleared land, however,\r\ncontinues productive, and would ultimately reward him, if there was no\r\nprincipal or interest to pay. By suffering privations, he may wait like\r\nthe capitalist for distant returns, which, on arriving, would be paid to\r\nthe real proprietor of the land; and like an over-rented East Lothian\r\nfarmer, he would not receive the fruits of his own labour. It is\r\noverlooking the difficulties of first settlement, which has involved\r\nhalf the recent settlers inextricably in debt, given the storekeeper\r\nsuch influence over the farmer, and prevented the labourer from\r\nobtaining cash wages.\r\n\r\nIn almost all parts of the country, landowners or their agents will urge\r\npeople to settle on land, well knowing that every yard which is cleared\r\nof trees will ultimately become valuable to the estate, although the\r\nsettler may be ruined by his engagement. Is it from philanthropic or\r\ninterested motives the puffs regarding Upper Canada have been\r\ncirculated? The unthinking poor too often become the dupes of the\r\ndesigning in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAmerica has been emphatically styled “the poor man’s country;” but Upper\r\nCanada does not now merit such a title. The system of store pay, which\r\nis so general in the province, operates against the poor man, and does\r\nnot affect the rich. The system of selling land in large lots on credit\r\nhas a similar effect; while the late rise in the value of land seems to\r\nme to be chiefly destructive to the poor man’s hopes, by diminishing the\r\ndemand for labour, and increasing his difficulty of purchasing land.\r\n\r\nIn stating my belief that the middle-aged agricultural labourer of\r\nBritain need not change his residence to Upper Canada, I supposed him to\r\nbe without capital, having constant employment, and living in some\r\ndegree of comfort at home. The chance of such a person becoming an\r\nindependent landowner is small, with irregular employment and store pay.\r\nThe case of the rural inhabitants in many parts of the Highlands of\r\nScotland and Ireland is, however, different, and they would find their\r\ncondition improved by a change of residence. The sober, the prudent, and\r\nthe industrious of any country will, however, succeed in Upper Canada,\r\nif they can laugh at the hardships of first settlement, and with\r\npersevering industry look forward to be ultimately rewarded. It seems to\r\nme to be a country chiefly for the young, and those seeking to provide\r\nfor a family.\r\n\r\nOf the unagricultural population of Upper Canada, and their prospects, I\r\nam not well qualified to speak. Clergymen, lawyers, and doctors, seem\r\nnot to be much cared for by the inhabitants, and but indifferently\r\nrewarded. Bricklayers find ready employment. Stone-masons are not\r\nwanted. Joiners, who can put a great deal of rough work through their\r\nhands, are in constant demand at higher wages than other tradesmen, with\r\nthe advantage of employment in winter. Tailors, shoemakers, and\r\nblacksmiths, have good wages in towns and villages. When they commence\r\nbusiness on their own account in the country, the thinness of the\r\nagricultural population does not always furnish regular employment, and\r\ntheir poverty renders cash difficult to be had. In remote parts of the\r\ncountry, the traffic is carried on chiefly in barter, and many tradesmen\r\nin such situations almost never finger money.\r\n\r\nThe merchants and storekeepers are said to be the most wealthy and\r\ninfluential people in the province, and owe the position they have\r\nattained to the situation and character of the inhabitants. The settlers\r\nbeing thinly scattered over an immense and almost inaccessible\r\nterritory, are necessarily unacquainted with traffic and the price of\r\ncommodities. Their limited produce does not spur them into active\r\nexertion to dispose of it; and the state of the roads only admitting of\r\ntransport for a part of the year, confines the time of sale to the\r\nwinter months. During this season, the St Lawrence, which is the only\r\nchannel of trade, being closed by ice, limits the number of merchants,\r\nand drives all out of the market but capitalists. The necessities of\r\nfarmers do not enable them to hold produce from year to year, and they\r\nappear to be at the mercy of the merchants, who obtain thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of bushels of wheat, at the head of Lake Ontario, in\r\nexchange for shoes and other necessaries, without a fraction of cash\r\nbeing paid on either side. The inland storekeeper has still greater\r\nadvantages over the farmer, and their profits are said to be excessive;\r\n300 per cent on dry goods having been currently obtained at one time.\r\nThe merchant and storekeeper is, however, distant from the markets of\r\nBritain, which regulates the price of Canadian wheat; and the navigation\r\nof the St Lawrence, and transport of goods, are so expensive, that\r\nprofits may not be so great as is reported. Of their influence in the\r\ncountry, there is, however, no doubt; and that it arises from the\r\npecuniary difficulties of landowners is universally admitted, who, in\r\nnumerous instances, are irretrievably burdened with debt.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers, at the close of the war with the colonies, being at\r\ntoo great a distance to admit of much intercourse with each other, and\r\nhaving no outlet for their produce, soon sunk into listless inactivity.\r\nMany Germans and Dutch afterwards followed, who commonly settled near\r\neach other, and although quiet and industrious people, were altogether\r\nwithout enterprise. The greater portion of British emigrants, who first\r\nsettled in the province, having little capital or education, and\r\nobtaining grants of forest in isolated situations, made small progress\r\nin a mode of farming so new to them. Having been nurtured in poverty,\r\nthey had few wants and were not ambitious to improve their condition.\r\nFrom a people so situated, and composed of such materials, little could\r\nbe expected. Individuals connected with government seem to have been\r\nmore solicitous about their own than the people’s welfare, and little\r\nwas done to call forth the resources of the country, or to rouse the\r\nslumbering energies of the inhabitants. The people, however, formed good\r\nsubjects for active traders, who still gather a plentiful harvest. How\r\nlong this state of things may last with traders will depend on\r\ncompetition. Their profits will fall with the opening of communication\r\nthroughout the country, but capital employed in trade is likely to yield\r\na good return, so long as the necessities of the agricultural population\r\ncontinue urgent.\r\n\r\nEvery inhabitant of Britain, contemplating the commencement of trade in\r\nUpper Canada, must be prepared to do so in a new mode, and, while he\r\nviews high profits, he ought not to lose sight of transacting business\r\non a limited scale, and in an expensive and disagreeable manner.\r\n\r\nIf the early inhabitants of Upper Canada sunk into indolence, some of\r\nthe succeeding settlers were ill fitted to improve them, being blended\r\nwith the scum and refuse of mankind. For many years the bankrupts in\r\ncharacter and fortune, the poor, the idle, and the dissipated, departed\r\nfrom Britain. From the United States the knavish whites, and the runaway\r\nblacks found shelter, and after having cheated the Canadians again set\r\noff. Such a population receiving grants of forest, separated from each\r\nother by clergy reserves and large absentee estates, could not be\r\nexpected to exert themselves amidst the difficulties of first\r\nsettlement. People of enterprise, who reached the province, soon made a\r\nfortune and retired again.\r\n\r\nI found some of the oldest settlers treading out their wheat crop with\r\nhorses; living in miserable houses, and without a particle of sugar to\r\nsweeten their tea. This state of things arose from laziness, their\r\npossessions being large, their time unoccupied, and the juice of the\r\nmaple might have been collected a few yards from their residence for the\r\nmaking of sugar.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my visit nine-tenths of the hotel-keepers and\r\nstage-drivers, and most of the active business people, had originally\r\ncome from the United States. Every horse and ox of size or fatness could\r\nbe traced to have come from the same territory, and the Canadians appear\r\nto me to be much indebted to the people of the United States for any\r\nactivity and refinement that is to be met with in the province.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers, the people of business, and almost all travellers\r\nfor pleasure or health, having come from the United States, their\r\nmanners and customs have been impressed on the inhabitants of Upper\r\nCanada, and I do not think the large influx of British emigrants which\r\nhas taken place of late years will efface them. I found much less\r\nrefinement than in the lower province or in the United States, while the\r\ncoarse manners of the people, and their habits of intemperance, were so\r\nprominent, that I heard more oaths and witnessed more drunk people the\r\nfirst few days I was in Canada, than I had met with during my previous\r\nwanderings in the States. I must do Upper Canada, however, the justice\r\nto say, that such characters appeared to be late importations from\r\nBritain and Ireland, and I was sorry to observe intoxication was by no\r\nmeans confined to the lowest class of emigrants.\r\n\r\nKnowing that a great deal of moral worth, physical energy, and capital,\r\nhave lately flowed into Canada, I have no doubt of time producing an\r\nimportant change in the state of the country and people. Indeed, hewing\r\ndown the forest may be termed mortgaging labour to nature, whose\r\ngenerous returns accumulate like compound interest, and I look on Upper\r\nCanada as the germ of a numerously inhabited and wealthy state. Nothing\r\nbut misgovernment can prevent such a consummation. A number of human\r\nbeings have, however, been most improperly seduced into the province of\r\nlate years, and at present I regard Upper Canada as a wretched, an\r\nimmoral, and a misgoverned country.\r\n\r\nI found many of the Canadians filled with inveterate prejudice against\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States, whom they regarded as a band of\r\ncheating and lying democrats. Some excuse might have been found for this\r\nfeeling, had it alone existed amongst the first settlers, who suffered\r\nduring the late war; but the greatest degree of inveteracy was evinced\r\nby persons lately from Britain, whose conduct, in the intercourse of the\r\nworld, had not been altogether blameless at home. The prosperity of the\r\npeople of the United States seems to excite the envy of the Canadians.\r\nThe same feeling does not exist in the State of New York towards the\r\nCanadians, who are there considered indolent and dissipated.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Upper Canada is modelled after the British one, and\r\nthere is a council appointed for life by his Britannic Majesty on\r\ncertain conditions. The House of Assembly is chosen by voters,\r\ntwenty-one years of age, British subjects, and possessed of 40s.\r\nfreehold for a county election, and L.5 for a town qualification. The\r\nprovince possesses the power of taxing itself, and the impositions are\r\nas little felt as in any country in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a general opinion in Britain that Canada is an excellent\r\nsporting country, and almost every young emigrant carries out a gun with\r\nhim to shoot game. Few people however go in quest of it, the winters\r\nbeing so severe, and food so scarce, that game cannot exist in numbers.\r\nIn every situation deer is difficult to be had, and I only met with one\r\ndeer-shooter in my travels. The turkey is found only in the western\r\ndistrict in limited numbers. Quails are more plentiful, and confined to\r\nthe west. There are two kinds of pheasants throughout Canada, and not\r\nplentiful any where but in the west. The ruffed grouse or prairie hen\r\nhas never been found in the country. Ducks are particularly numerous in\r\nautumn, and at certain seasons so are woodcocks. I have seen more game\r\nin half-an-hour in Scotland than I saw in all my wanderings in Canada,\r\nand there is no part where good shooting can be obtained but near the\r\nRiver Detroit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  _United States—Climate—Diseases—Productions—Agriculture east of the\r\n    Alleghany Mountains—Agriculture west of the Mountains—Wages—Choice\r\n    of Residence—Progress of Wealth—Wages of the United States and the\r\n    Canadas—Profits of Capital._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe territory of the United States is situated between 24, 27, and 49°\r\nnorth latitude, and 10° east, to 54° west longitude from Washington. Its\r\nmean breadth from north to south is about 830 miles, and mean length\r\nfrom east to west, 2500 miles. The area embraces 2,076,410 square miles,\r\nor 1,328,902,400 acres, consisting of the following states and\r\nterritories: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Florida, and\r\nthe Arkansas, Michigan, Missouri, North-west and Western territories.\r\n\r\nA territory differs from a state in not sending members to Congress; and\r\nthe President of the United States, with consent of the senate, appoints\r\nthe executive officers. Congress has power to make general laws in the\r\nterritories, which become states on containing a sufficient population.\r\n\r\nMany people in Britain have difficulty in forming a conception of the\r\nextent of the United States, and imagine each state something like the\r\nsize of the counties in their own country. But some of the divisions\r\ninto which the territory is separated are much larger than the whole\r\nisland of Great Britain. The United States must therefore be considered\r\na union of countries—each state, having its own government and laws, is\r\ndivided into counties, which are subdivided into townships.\r\n\r\nHaving travelled over only a small portion of the United States\r\nterritory, lying between 37° and 45° north latitude, embracing the\r\nstates of New England, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, and the territory of Michigan, my remarks shall be\r\nconfined to this region, which might, with propriety, be divided into\r\nthe eastern, middle, and western states, if particular consideration was\r\nintended to be given it.\r\n\r\nThe climate of that portion of the United States which I travelled over\r\nparticipates of the general character of the continent, having the\r\nextremes of heat and cold. The length of winter will of course vary with\r\nthe latitude, which, in the north, will be nearly six months, and in the\r\nsouthern part, about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThis region is intersected by the Alleghany mountains, commencing in the\r\nstate of Maine, and passing through New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,\r\ndividing the country longitudinally. Some parts of this range is of\r\nconsiderable height—Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, being 6634 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. Monadnock, in the south-west corner of New\r\nHampshire, was the most elevated point which I was near, being 3254 feet\r\nin height, and, with the exception of the falls of the Niagara, the only\r\ntruly sublime object I saw in America. The Alleghany range varies in\r\nbreadth at different places. Across the mountains in New Hampshire is\r\nabout 120 miles—in New York, about 150 miles, and in Pennsylvania, 130\r\nmiles. In such situations, climate will be affected by altitude as well\r\nas latitude.\r\n\r\nIn the country east of the Alleghanies, north-east winds prevail for a\r\nconsiderable part of the year, especially in the New England states,\r\nwhere they are cold and raw to human feeling in the spring months. To\r\nthe west of the Alleghanies, the most prevalent wind is from the\r\nsouth-west, and is mild in temperature. The winds blowing chiefly from\r\ndifferent directions, on opposite sides of the mountains, have been\r\ningeniously accounted for by Volney and other writers, and thought to be\r\nconnected with the trade winds, gulf stream, a cold current of air from\r\nDavis’ Straits, and the configuration of the country. There seems to be\r\nan opinion amongst the writers on this subject, that the climate of the\r\nwest is two or three degrees milder than the east, under the same\r\nparallel of latitude—the winters of the latter being more severe, and\r\nthe summers of the former cooler. Judging from human feeling, this may\r\nperhaps appear to be the case from the influence of the sea air, in the\r\ncountry bounded by the Atlantic, but the thermometer observations which\r\nhave been published seem to make the temperature nearly alike at the\r\nsame altitude on both sides of the Alleghanies. The meteorology of the\r\nUnited States has not, however, been properly investigated, and the most\r\nimportant difference to the farmer, in the climate of the two countries,\r\nis a deeper fall of snow in the east than in the west, and a steadier\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Alleghany mountains, where north-east winds prevail\r\nin spring, consumption is a frequent complaint with the human race, and\r\nmore especially near the sea-coast, the air being particularly keen at\r\ncertain seasons. This disease is most frequent in the New England\r\nstates, where the cold and dampness of the north-east wind is strongly\r\nfelt. The inhabitants of New England have not that dark seered\r\ncomplexion so common in other parts of the Union, many of them closely\r\nresembling the people of Britain. It is probable the florid complexion\r\nof the people, and their proneness to consumption, arise from the\r\ndampness of the climate. To the west of the Alleghanies, the most common\r\ncomplaint is bilious fever, in every variety of type, passing by the\r\nnames of “ague,” “chill and fever,” and many etceteras. Fever is\r\nessentially a disease of the country, and seems connected with the\r\nluxuriance and decay of natural vegetation. In every part of inhabited\r\nAmerica, fever, originating from this cause, must be frequent, and will\r\nbe more severe towards the south, as the heat and length of summer\r\nincrease. It is common on the banks of rivers and on the prairies, from\r\nexhalations produced by the rays of the sun; and on first clearing wood\r\nlands, the same effects are produced. With the progress of cultivation,\r\nfever is likely to abate, and I have no doubt the fatality of the\r\ndisease in this region is at present heightened by the quantities of\r\nanimal food consumed by the inhabitants. On both sides of the\r\nAlleghanies, inflammatory complaints, arising from sudden transitions of\r\ntemperature, are common. There is no reason, however, to imagine this\r\npart of America more unhealthy than the Canadas, unless the prevalence\r\nof north-east winds in the east, and the want of cultivation in the\r\nwest, are more unfavourable than a severe and steady winter.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural productions are the same as what have been noticed as\r\nthe growth of the Canadas. A portion of this country may, however, be\r\ntermed the region of Indian corn, which grows with uncommon luxuriance,\r\nand is one of the most important plants in American farming. Mr John\r\nTaylor of Virginia called it the “meal, meadow, and manure” of the farm,\r\nand it well merits his emphatic description. It is used as human food in\r\na variety of forms; in maintaining and fattening animals during winter\r\nit far surpasses every agricultural product, and affords a great\r\nquantity of materials for manure. When soil and climate are adapted to\r\nits growth, it furnishes more nourishment for man and beast on a given\r\nspace, and with less labour, than any other plant. It is the only means\r\nof fattening animals during winter in remote parts of the country, and,\r\nunder present circumstances, no district which I visited in course of my\r\ntour can become eminent in breeding and fattening live stock, which is\r\nnot congenial to the growth of Indian corn. It does not seem to be\r\ncultivated with success beyond 43° north latitude, and an agricultural\r\nemigrant, who values the necessaries of life, ought only to settle where\r\nthis plant can be successfully grown.\r\n\r\nIndian corn seems to differ from most other agricultural plants, by\r\ngrowing vigorously for a succession of years on certain soils without an\r\napplication of manure. There is much evidence to establish this fact in\r\nthe Western United States, and amongst the Indians in Upper Canada. I\r\nsaw it growing luxuriantly on soft prairie soil in Ohio, which farmers\r\nassured me could not produce a wheat crop without an application of\r\nmanure. It is this peculiarity of Indian corn which has given rise to\r\nsome exaggerated accounts of the fertility of American soil, by\r\nproducing so many crops without manure. In some parts of the country,\r\nIndian corn seems to be like an indigenous plant, and its growth for a\r\nsuccession of years is perhaps no greater test of fertility of soil than\r\ngrass is in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the eastern side of the Alleghanies is generally of an\r\ninferior description, with exception of the lands on the banks of\r\nrivers. The cleared lands have been long cropped under the robbing\r\nsystem, and are far from being productive. The whole of the land that is\r\nworth occupying is owned by private individuals, although a great\r\nportion of it is covered with forest; and I was frequently told, that in\r\nall situations near a village, or which had ready access to\r\nwater-carriage, forest land was more valuable than what had been\r\ncleared, fuel having became so dear of late years. Much of the land\r\ncovered with wood is not worth cultivating, and should the forest be\r\nremoved for fuel, it is likely to remain in pasturage or be suffered to\r\nproduce trees again. The price of farms varies from L.5 to L.30 sterling\r\nper acre, according to quality of soil, buildings, and situation. Labour\r\ncan at all times be had, and every description of produce finds a ready\r\nmarket. Manures are chiefly employed in growing vegetables, and can be\r\nbought from the stablers of New York at 7d. sterling a cart-load,\r\nsimilar in shape and size to the carts used in Scotland. Market\r\ngardening is the most profitable department of farming, and the growing\r\nof grass ranks next.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the good markets, command of labour, and low price of\r\nmanure, the cultivation of grain in this part of the country is attended\r\nwith little profit, which circumstance, joined to a grass crop being\r\nmore lucrative, illustrates the parts nature and man perform in the\r\nproduction of farm produce which has been so often alluded to. And a\r\nBriton who has been accustomed to pay a high rent will be very apt to\r\noverlook, on first reaching America, many circumstances affecting the\r\nprofits of farming.\r\n\r\nLand which has been impoverished by a long succession of crops, under\r\nthe robbing system, will not yield much grain without a plentiful supply\r\nof manure, which the rate of labour may frequently prevent being applied\r\nwithout incurring loss. Suppose an acre of wheat to yield with a\r\nmoderate application of manure twenty-four bushels of wheat per acre,\r\nwhich is worth $1 per bushel. The cost of producing the crop, including\r\ntwice ploughing, harrowing, seed, sowing, harvesting, and carrying home,\r\nthrashing, dressing, and marketing, will amount to $14, leaving only\r\n$10, or L.2, 2s. 6d., to meet the interest of capital employed in the\r\npurchase and cultivation of the land, taxes, professional profit, and\r\nthe purchase and application of manure. If the purchase money of the\r\nland and capital invested in cultivation amount to $60 per acre, the\r\ninterest may be taken at $4, leaving only $6, or L.1, 5s. 6d. sterling,\r\nfor taxes and manure. The cost of manure is scarcely worth estimating,\r\nbut the expense of its carriage and application are so high as often to\r\nforbid its use. On the assumed data there will only remain about 18s.\r\nsterling per acre to meet the carriage and spreading of manure. The\r\nexpense of labour is strikingly exhibited in contrast with the value of\r\nthe crop. The wages of a labourer may be stated at seventy-five cents\r\nper day, and the value of an acre of wheat would employ a man about\r\nthirty-two days. In Britain a wheat crop of similar productiveness, at\r\nordinary prices and rates of labour, would employ a man between eighty\r\nand ninety days. The same mode of management is obviously not suited to\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\nIn grass husbandry human labour is but little employed, nature being the\r\nchief agent of production, and hence it is remunerating. The difficulty\r\nof transporting certain kinds of grass produce from a distance, such as\r\nhay and fresh dairy produce, keeps up the price of these commodities,\r\nbut the small quantity of labour bestowed on their production is the\r\nchief cause of their profitableness.\r\n\r\nA man with capital may purchase a farm to the east of the Alleghany\r\nrange, and occupy it with a prospect of having a good return for the\r\ncapital invested, if he possess prudence and industry. He must not,\r\nhowever, lavish capital on fanciful improvements, or employ much labour\r\non finical operations. Wages are so high that he will require to\r\ncalculate the value of every day’s labour, and render the closest\r\npersonal superintendence, and perhaps also assistance. Unless this is\r\ndone farming will be unprofitable, as a great many of the workmen are\r\nidle and unsteady. Farming cannot, however, be pursued on a large scale\r\nwith a prospect of success, from the difficulty of superintending the\r\noperations and forming a proper division of labour with unskilful and\r\nuntractable workmen. There is, however, an excellent field for prudent\r\nskill and industry near all towns. In short, science seems scarcely to\r\nhave been thought of in American farming, and a cautious application of\r\nit in draining and other improvements, in particular situations, would\r\nbe remunerating.\r\n\r\nLand may be rented in many parts of the country on fair terms, more\r\nespecially near towns. In such situations many British emigrants\r\nsuccessfully pursue market gardening and dairy husbandry. Native\r\nAmericans prefer occupying land of their own to paying rent for the use\r\nof a farm belonging to others.\r\n\r\nThe labouring emigrant does not readily find agricultural employment on\r\nthe east coast, from the country being thickly settled, and the constant\r\ninflux of emigrants without funds to support them. He should, therefore,\r\nlose no time in pushing back into the country, where wages are higher\r\ncompared with the price of the necessaries of life and land, and where\r\ninformation necessary to a settler on cheap land, can alone be acquired.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the western side of the Alleghanies is generally much\r\nsuperior to the eastern, although it is to be found of all descriptions\r\nand degrees of fertility. It has not been very long cropped, and the\r\nnatural composition of a great portion of it will, under any\r\ncircumstances, render it productive of wheat and Indian corn. Almost all\r\nthe land in the eastern part of this district is owned by private\r\nindividuals, but much of it remains uncleared of forest. Towards the\r\nwest the greater part of the land is held by the United States\r\ngovernment, and costs $1¼ per acre. In every part of the country forest\r\nor improved land may be purchased, and the price is governed by local\r\nsituation and other circumstances. Labour can generally be had, except\r\nin the extreme west. Farm produce is in constant demand, and prices are\r\nregulated by the markets of the towns on the east coast and New Orleans,\r\nto all of which there is access by rivers, canals, or railroads. Prices\r\nmay, therefore, at all times be considered lower than the markets on the\r\neast by the expense of transport. Manures are very seldom used except in\r\nthe neighbourhood of large towns, where the demand for vegetables and\r\nshortness of carriage render it worthy of the farmer’s attention.\r\n\r\nThe money wages of labour may be stated to be nearly the same from the\r\neast to the extreme west, but any difference that exists is towards a\r\nrise in the west. In the same direction a decline in the price of\r\nproduce takes place. Therefore, as the distance from the markets on the\r\ncoast increases, the farmer pays a greater share of produce to the\r\nlabourer, and must be remunerated either by the low price of land or its\r\nnatural fertility. Labourers are of a more unsatisfactory description\r\nthan in the east, land being so cheap that every prudent man is enabled\r\nto purchase a farm for himself in the course of a year or two, and it is\r\nonly the imprudent who continue labourers. The character of the workmen\r\nrenders labour dearer than is at first apparent.\r\n\r\nThe country to the west of the Alleghanies is of such extent, and\r\ngradually increasing in distance from the seaport towns which regulate\r\nthe price of the land produce, that farms of equal quality of soil vary\r\nfrom 5s. 4d. to L.12 sterling per acre.\r\n\r\nA person possessed of capital may purchase a farm in many situations\r\nwith advantage. But the exercise of prudence and industry in choice of\r\nsituation and management is particularly called for. The price of\r\nproduce is so low compared with labour, that only a small portion of\r\ncapital and labour can be profitably applied to the cultivation of the\r\nsoil. In almost every instance where cultivation is followed personal\r\nassistance will be necessary to obtain profit. It has already been\r\nremarked, that money wages in the west are nearly the same as in the\r\neast, and as hired men are generally boarded, the western employer has\r\nsome advantage from the cheapness of provisions. Supposing an acre of\r\nground without an application of manure yields twenty bushels of wheat,\r\nwhich sells at 50 cents per bushel, and a labourer gets $120 a-year with\r\nboard, the value of an acre of wheat will employ a man twenty-six days\r\nwithout including board. To the east of the Alleghanies the value of an\r\nacre of wheat was stated to pay the wages of a hired man about\r\nthirty-two days, including board. In the one case, however, manure is\r\nsupposed to have been applied, and in the other it had not. But in many\r\nparts of the west, wheat generally sells considerably lower than 50\r\ncents a-bushel, and in such situations a hired labourer either obtains a\r\ngreater share of the produce, or the fertility of the soil is greater.\r\nIn Sangamon county, in the state of Illinois, the soil of which is very\r\nfertile, the price of wheat at Springfield was 37½ cents when I was\r\nthere. Supposing wheat to yield twenty-five bushels per acre, its value\r\nwould employ a labourer about twenty-five days. In every situation the\r\nhiring of agricultural labour ought to be determined by calculation. If\r\nthe former obtains a fair profit from the outlay of capital he need not\r\nrepine at the wages of the labourer, however high they may be.\r\n\r\nAn emigrant will not always find agricultural employment to the west of\r\nthe Alleghanies from the low price of farm produce; but there is always\r\na demand for labour in towns and villages, at high wages, and he need\r\nnot remain idle if he is disposed to work. An industrious and sober man\r\nmust rapidly accumulate wealth by working for hire, and many perhaps err\r\nby purchasing land instead of continuing to work under the direction of\r\nothers. On leaving New York, a gardener, who was working at Haddington\r\nwhen I left Scotland, gave me ten pounds sterling, which he had saved\r\nsince his arrival in America, to enable his wife and family to reach\r\nhim. A young man, whom I had often employed at spade-work on Mungoswells\r\nfarm, at 1s. 6d. a-day without board, was earning, by sawing stones at\r\nCincinnati, 4s. 3d. a-day with board.\r\n\r\nA person cannot purchase and farm land to the east of the Alleghanies\r\nwithout possessing a considerable portion of capital; and to the west of\r\nthe mountains land is not likely to be cultivated with profit without\r\npersonal labour. The luxuries of life being prepared in the east, to\r\nmeet an extensive demand, are cheaper than in the west by the expense of\r\ntransport from one market to the other. It is the reverse with the\r\nnecessaries of life; and the agricultural emigrant ought to be guided in\r\nhis choice of residence on either side of the Alleghanies by his habits,\r\nfinances, and wants.\r\n\r\nAll wealth, according to the views I have endeavoured to establish,\r\nbeing the result of nature and labour, the riches of a community must be\r\nregulated by the soil and climate of the country, and the skill and\r\nindustry of the inhabitants. The soil and climate of two countries being\r\nequal, the most skilful and industrious people will be the\r\nwealthiest—with equal skill and industry the inhabitants of the country\r\nmost favoured by nature will become the richest. Under a parity of\r\ncircumstances, with regard to nature and inhabitants, the oldest nation\r\nwill be the wealthiest, and the progress of new countries in wealth will\r\ndepend on the facilities of cultivation—a forest-covered surface\r\nyielding wealth slower than one clothed with grass. The ratio of extent\r\nof territory to the inhabitants of new countries also affects the\r\nprogress of wealth. With a limited surface capital will rapidly\r\nincrease, from the cheapness and division of labour that will\r\nnecessarily ensue, and wealth will be unequally distributed amongst the\r\ninhabitants. With an extensive surface capital will accumulate slowly,\r\nand all the inhabitants will enjoy an ample share of the necessaries of\r\nlife, without possessing much tangible capital.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in this portion of the United States had to struggle\r\nwith severe privations. Besides being engaged in warfare with the\r\nnatives, they settled in insulated situations in the midst of a densely\r\nwooded surface, without experience as to the mode of rendering it\r\nfruitful, or possessing facilities of communication. They were unable to\r\nsubsist by their labour, and many perished for want of food. But on\r\nevery portion of cleared surface nature continued productive, and her\r\nexertions being aided by new skill and industry, wealth appeared in the\r\nprogress of time. There being no rent, and scarcely a burden of any kind\r\nto pay, the inhabitants reaped the combined fruits of their own and\r\nnature’s labour without division. Individuals had as much land as they\r\nchose to cultivate; and having every inducement to render it productive,\r\nthey rewarded labour with liberal wages. The abundance of land induced\r\nlabourers to turn landholders, and reward others with high wages, who\r\nlikewise became landholders. Thus there was a constant progression in\r\nsociety, by the prudent and industrious labourers rising into wealth,\r\nand receding from the first point of settlement on becoming landholders.\r\nThese movements continue up to the present time with the existing\r\ncause—abundance and cheapness of land, to which many of the\r\npeculiarities of the country and its inhabitants may be traced.\r\n\r\nGood land being sold by the United States government at $1¼ per acre,\r\npeople will not permanently hire themselves for a less reward than can\r\nbe obtained by cultivating on their own account. When competition\r\ndepresses wages, operatives commence farming, and wages rise. Thus the\r\nwages of labour are regulated by the profits of farming, and will\r\ncontinue to be so until all the good land is occupied.\r\n\r\nThe profits of farming do not regulate the wages of labour in the\r\nCanadas, because land is there held by monopolists, or sold at a\r\nmonopoly price. And the late rise in the price of land in Upper Canada\r\nnot only renders the ultimate prospect of labourers becoming landholders\r\nmore distant, but also lowers the wages of operatives through\r\ncompetition, by tending to confine them to their professions. But\r\nsupposing land to be equally abundant and cheap in the Canadas and\r\nUnited States, and the wages of labour to be regulated in both countries\r\nby the profits of farming, wages would necessarily be higher in the\r\nUnited States, from possessing superiority of climate. Nature performs\r\nmore towards the manufacture of agricultural produce in the United\r\nStates than in the Canadas, and the reward of industry, which is divided\r\nbetween the landholder and labourer, is consequently greater.\r\n\r\nThis view of the wages of labour in the different parts of North America\r\nwhich I visited, is supported by facts, wages being generally\r\nconsiderably higher in the United States than in the Canadas. During the\r\nsummer of 1833 the carpenters of New York struck work when getting 5s.\r\nsterling per day, and by doing so obtained 6s. per day. The future\r\nprospects of operatives appear to be good, a vast portion of the best\r\nland of the country being still unoccupied, a subject which will be\r\nafterwards noticed.\r\n\r\nThe profits of capital employed in farming do not seem to affect the\r\nprofits of capital invested in other fields of production. Indeed, the\r\nhigh price of labour, and the difficulty of combining systematically and\r\ngiving proper effect to agricultural labour in most parts of the United\r\nStates, render the employment of much capital in farming unprofitable.\r\nThe high price of labour affects the investment of capital in other\r\nchannels, and it will be found difficult to manage a large fortune\r\nsafely and profitably. On this account wealth is seldom accumulated in\r\nlarge masses, while almost all the inhabitants have it in their power to\r\nacquire a competency. The customs of the people are favourable to this\r\ndegree of wealth—a father’s property being generally equally divided at\r\ndeath amongst his children. Capital, however, in many cases, will enter\r\ninto competition with labour, and its profits in the United States,\r\nwhere the fields of production are so extensive, and its inhabitants so\r\nenterprising, cannot be low for many generations to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  _Wealth and refinement of different parts—Writers on American\r\n    Manners—Plainness—Civility—New England Character—Unfair\r\n    dealing—Emigrant’s Situation and Character—Government—United States\r\n    and Upper Canada._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comparative wealth and refinement of the eastern parts of the United\r\nStates, arises from the annual savings of the combined exertions of\r\nnature and industry having had time to accumulate and affect the\r\ninhabitants; and the gradual falling off in these attributes, which\r\ntakes place towards the west, is owing to most of the settlers having\r\noriginally been operatives in the east, and not having had time to\r\naccumulate wealth, or adopt refinements.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not often witness the domestic manners of the Americans,\r\nmy opportunities of meeting the inhabitants of the United States in\r\npublic were frequent, and the impressions imbibed during my intercourse\r\nwith them were different from what the accounts of others led me to\r\nexpect. Many travellers who have written on the subject were perhaps ill\r\nqualified to form a just estimate of American manners and character,\r\nfrom the sphere of society in which they themselves had previously\r\nmoved. No scion nor associate of British aristocracy, who has not been\r\nbrought into familiar intercourse with the middling and lower orders of\r\nhis own countrymen, is likely to do justice to the Americans, and the\r\ntenor of many of the remarks which have been given to the world on the\r\nsubject is evidence of the writers never having before associated with\r\nthe class of people to whom they allude. The inhabitants of Britain, in\r\nprivate and public life, being divided into grades, some individuals are\r\naltogether unacquainted with the manners and customs of the classes\r\nbelow them. And as Englishmen of high pretensions and refinement, on\r\nreaching America, mingle on terms of equality at public tables and in\r\nconveyances with the commonest operatives, they feel disgusted with the\r\nmanners of the people around them, without considering they belong to a\r\ndifferent class from their own associates at home. In Britain, a person\r\nof rank is generally regarded with respect by the classes below him. In\r\nthe United States, rank seldom meets with or expects deference from the\r\npeople, and the humblest citizen familiarly enters into conversation\r\nwith every individual who addresses him. This self-possession of the\r\nAmericans is often mistaken for forwardness, and their unembarrassed\r\nconversation for insolence. In Britain, the different classes of\r\npopulation generally remain distinct, and many of their excesses are hid\r\nfrom common gaze. In most parts of the United States, the bar-rooms of\r\nhotels form the only scenes of tippling, and, being at all times open to\r\nthe public, a traveller is apt to consider the people more dissipated\r\nthan they really are. Were a gentlemanly foreigner to meet the lowest\r\nclass of the people of England at table, and associate with them in\r\ntheir haunts of vice, his adventures would form a high-coloured picture\r\nof British manners and society.\r\n\r\nThe strictures of British writers on the manners of the people of the\r\nUnited States seem to have created a strong prejudice in the minds of\r\nemigrants of every description. In the month of May last, a person who\r\nhad long followed the trade of a country wright in his native village,\r\nsituated in East Lothian, introduced himself, and asked my opinion\r\nregarding the best place of settlement for himself and family in\r\nAmerica. He had made up his mind to emigrate, and left me in the\r\ndetermination of residing in the United States. I have just learned,\r\nhowever, that he keeps a spirit store in the village of Niagara, Upper\r\nCanada, and assigned as a reason for leaving the States, that he could\r\nnot endure the manners of the people. The conduct of this Scottish clown\r\nis a good satire on the remarks of such refined travellers as Trollope,\r\nHamilton, &c.\r\n\r\nOn first reaching the United States, the plainness of the people’s\r\nmanners appeared remarkable. In all classes there was a total absence of\r\ngrimace and corporeal token of respect, with corresponding sounds of\r\naddress, an expression of obligation or thankfulness seldom being heard.\r\nIn courteousness the inhabitants appear as far behind the British as the\r\nFrench exceed them. But, on the other hand, vulgarity, rudeness, or\r\ninsolence, is almost never met with in the humblest walks of life.\r\nMechanics and storekeepers ride in the same vehicle, and sit down at the\r\nsame table, with the most polished members of society; all seem desirous\r\nof behaving well to each other, a rude or indelicate remark never being\r\nmade, nor a disgusting practice indulged in. On one occasion only I met\r\nwith revolting behaviour, at the table of the Washington hotel, during\r\nmy first residence at New York. On my second visit, I found the\r\nindividual still an inmate of the house, in which he had lodged for\r\nfourteen years. He was an eccentric character, and originally from\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nA general propriety of deportment and softness of manner pervades the\r\nlower classes, and that coarseness, which is sometimes met with in\r\nBritain, does not appear to exist in the United States; but certain\r\ncircles of society in Britain seem to have a higher polish than what is\r\nto be met with in America, and perhaps the general standard of manners\r\nof both countries is not widely different. The lower orders of the\r\nUnited States are, however, beyond all question, greatly superior in\r\nrefinement and intelligence to the lower orders of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe many classes into which society is divided in Britain, and the\r\nprivileges assigned them by the laws and customs of the country, are so\r\ndistinct, that some individuals, who are jealous of their dignity,\r\nendeavour to repulse all beneath them. On the other hand, some people\r\nseek distinction by rudeness towards others. And amidst such jarring\r\nelements the poor sometimes become servile and debased, the rich\r\ncontemptuous and overbearing. In America, every individual seems\r\npossessed of self-respect, and in the intercourse of life, arrogance is\r\nseldom assumed, and never submitted to. Worth is duly appreciated, and\r\nhollow pretension exposed.\r\n\r\nThe civility of all classes in the United States is so universal, that\r\nduring my intercourse with the inhabitants, I scarcely experienced an\r\nindication of insolence, and never observed that democratic sauciness\r\nwhich I was taught to expect amongst the lower orders. Every individual\r\nfeels that he is independent, and never alludes to the subject. The case\r\nis, however, different in Canada, where some British emigrants seldom\r\nlet an opportunity escape of telling a well-dressed person, that “this\r\nis a free country, and that he does not care a * * * * for any man.” The\r\nemancipated bondsman alone boasts of being free from fetters. A\r\nforeigner, however, who arrogates to himself superiority in the States,\r\nwill be despised by the meanest of the people, and his money will\r\nneither purchase their attention nor services. The United States which I\r\nvisited, seem to me an excellent place for teaching an overweening\r\nperson a due estimate of himself and his fellow-mortals. Twelve months’\r\nintercourse with the people would greatly improve the fagged and fagging\r\nyouthful aristocracy of Britain. Their haughtiness of demeanour, and\r\nacerbity and impatience of temper would be changed, and they would\r\nreturn home with a just sense of the place they occupy in the world, and\r\nqualified to discharge the important duties they owe society. Every\r\nBriton who has mingled with the people for any length of time, and\r\npractised self-examination, will testify to the truth of my remarks.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the state of manners and customs in the United States,\r\nthe foppish need not desert Britain in search of happiness in the New\r\nWorld, for there such persons are lightly esteemed. The emigrant ought\r\nnot to vex himself about having heard that people place their feet on\r\ntables, or on the mantel-piece, as nobody will interfere with the\r\nposition of his on the floor, nor whether they chew tobacco or cheese,\r\nas he will be allowed to eat what he pleases. The necessaries of life\r\nare generally obtained without much difficulty, and whoever regards\r\nmankind as created by the same Being, of the same materials, for the\r\nsame end, and entitled to the same privileges, need not despair of\r\nhappiness if he leads a life of virtue and industry.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater portion of the people I came in contact with were\r\nnatives of the New England States, who seem to have spread over a\r\nconsiderable portion of the States of New York and Illinois, and the\r\nterritory of Michigan. The character of this people has often been\r\ndrawn. They have many strong characteristics, and in nine cases out of\r\nten may be recognised in walking into a public room, having an air of\r\nconfidence and self-esteem above all other people. They form the true\r\n_Yankees_, and are obnoxious over the continent of North America, like\r\nthe Yorkshiremen in England, and Aberdeenshiremen in Scotland, for their\r\nunremitting keenness and industry in business, which may have been\r\nengendered by the poverty of the soil, and badness of the climate of New\r\nEngland. They are descended from the first settlers who fled from\r\nreligious persecution in England, and seem to inherit what may be\r\nsupposed to have been the prominent dispositions of their forefathers.\r\nThey faithfully observe all the external forms of decency, and their\r\ntaciturn, phlegmatic, and calculating disposition, may render them\r\nobjects of dislike. But their intelligence, self-esteem, enterprise, and\r\nperseverance fit them for a young country, and the growing prosperity of\r\nthe northern section of the United States’ territory is in a\r\nconsiderable degree indebted to them.\r\n\r\nThe Yankees have been generally charged with unfair dealing, and\r\nalthough I had no opportunity of judging of this matter personally, many\r\ncircumstances induce me to think the charge is to a certain extent well\r\nfounded. To emigrants the morals of a people are of more consequence\r\nthan their manners, between which, however, there is no connexion. The\r\nIrish are a more polite people than the Scotch, but greatly inferior in\r\nmorality; and the Yankees, with all the outward forms of virtue, are\r\nconsidered the most dishonest race in the Union. Yankee knavery is said\r\nto consist in overreaching every one with whom they have dealings, if\r\nthe character of their customer admits of their doing so with impunity.\r\nThe charge of dishonesty is not applicable to the people of New England\r\ngenerally, and much of the prejudice against them arises from their\r\nindustry and success in business. In course of conversation I never\r\nheard imposition of any kind alluded to in terms of approbation, while\r\nhonesty of character, and more especially in public men, was invariably\r\npraised. Virtue will ever be respected in civilized society.\r\n\r\nIn new and extensive territories the restraints of dishonesty seem\r\nweaker, and the temptations to overreach stronger than in densely\r\npeopled old countries. In new countries, local attachments, family\r\ncharacter, and many other feelings which influence conduct, are unfelt.\r\nIndividuals seldom remain long in one place, and traffic with others\r\nsimilarly situated. The laws are imperfectly put in force, and\r\nsuccessful fraud is sometimes considered clear gain, as the parties may\r\nnever hold farther intercourse, and in the event of exposure, a change\r\nof residence obviates disgrace. Most of the people are poor, and grasp\r\nat wealth. There are few prejudices of birth or station in society, and\r\nno barrier in the field of enterprise or ambition to the lowest\r\nindividual. The reverse of all this takes place in old countries, where\r\nother policy than honesty commonly entails ruin in worldly matters. In\r\nboth situations the degree of moral principle may be the same. But in\r\nBritain all is not virtue which appears on the surface of society, and\r\nthe fear of punishment, resulting from public opinion and effective\r\nlaws, has perhaps more influence than the dictates of conscience in\r\nchecking knavery. The intercourse of the people of Britain and certain\r\nparts of America, seems to arise more from the different circumstances\r\nin which they are placed than from religious and moral feeling.\r\n\r\nIf the view which I have taken of the commercial intercourse of new\r\ncountries is correct, the emigrant will soon discover that the New\r\nEnglanders are not the only sharpers in America. A gentleman settled in\r\nthe township of Hinchinbrooke, Lower Canada, in writing to his friends\r\nin East Lothian, states, “although the inhabitants here are not Yankees,\r\nyet all act on the Yankee system.” And I shall renounce all pretensions\r\nto discernment if many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada are not the\r\nmost accomplished Yankees on the other side of the Atlantic. The change\r\nwhich sometimes takes place in the habits and morals of people on\r\nreaching America is not confined to the modes of acquiring property. In\r\nsome parts of Upper Canada the Sabbath was chiefly spent in shooting,\r\nand many Scotsmen did so who lived in the vicinity of a church. Every\r\nnew settler is liable to be beset by all the knaves and cheats of the\r\ndistrict on his first arrival. If he defeat their first attempt they\r\nseldom make a second, and he may afterwards transact business without\r\nmuch risk of being imposed on. Too much caution cannot, however, be\r\nexercised at first settlement, more especially towards old countrymen,\r\nwho can make advances under more favourable circumstances than a native\r\nAmerican, and are equally prone to take advantage.\r\n\r\nThe greedy and dishonest intercourse which takes place in many parts of\r\nNorth America must be repugnant to honourable feeling, and emigrants\r\nought to guard against being led into the system. But however unpleasant\r\nsuch a state of society may be, the people of Britain need not shun the\r\nNew World on such grounds. Your experience in life, my dear brother, has\r\nnot been extensive, but from your knowledge of, and intercourse with,\r\nthe people of East Lothian, you must be aware that amongst the peers of\r\nthe realm, their law agents and factors, the tenantry and dealers in\r\nhorses, cattle, and corn, there are individuals who lay aside morality\r\nwhen transacting business, and are alone guided by the letter of the\r\nlaws. Their conversation is as little to be depended on as the passing\r\nwind, and their writings are sometimes worded with intent to deceive. In\r\nshort, there are bad characters in every part of the world, and whoever\r\nis capable of transacting business with the _Yankees_ of Britain need\r\nnot be afraid to encounter those in America. I admit the degree of\r\nmercantile honour and morality may be higher in Britain than in America,\r\nand imposition less frequent, but contend there are cheats in both\r\ncountries, and the same caution which is necessary to meet the plans of\r\none knave in Britain will defeat the tricks of twenty in America.\r\n\r\nThe situation of an emigrant on reaching America must be very different\r\nfrom what it was at home. In the midst of a people whose manners and\r\ncustoms are in some measure new to him, he is an isolated being, without\r\nany one in whom he can confide for advice and assistance. If he cannot\r\nthink for himself, and rely on his own resources in transacting\r\nbusiness, he will be a helpless mortal, and in all probability become\r\nthe prey of designing persons. It is the dependence of the inhabitants\r\non each other in old countries which unfits so many of them to play\r\ntheir part in the newly settled portions of the United States, where\r\neach individual acts independently, and trusts to himself alone.\r\nAmericans are, therefore, the most acute people in the world in the\r\nordinary intercourse of life, and few foreigners need take up their\r\nabode in the country in hope of outstripping them. The most essential\r\nrequisites in an emigrant are energy of mind, steadiness of purpose, and\r\npersevering industry. Without possessing these qualifications, no one\r\nneed expect to mingle successfully in the bustle of life; although it is\r\npossible to exist as a farmer, without being so highly gifted. It is a\r\nwrong estimate of themselves which so often gives rise to disappointment\r\nand failure on the part of British emigrants. There is nothing in the\r\nsoil or climate of America which can impart wisdom to the fool, energy\r\nto the imbecile, activity to the slothful, or determination to the\r\nirresolute. Examination of character should therefore form part of every\r\nemigrant’s preparation, as his fate will perhaps altogether depend on\r\nit. It is folly for the idle and imaginative beings who float in British\r\nsociety to seek an Elysium in the United States, from whence they will\r\nagain be speedily wafted to their native country. It is the industrious,\r\nprudent, and frugal people alone that can calculate on success.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the United States consist of\r\ntwenty-four separate states, with a general government for defence,\r\ncommerce, and taxation. Each state has a distinct republican government,\r\nfor the regulation of its own affairs. The governments of the different\r\nstates resemble each other, although not precisely alike, and consist of\r\n_Legislative_, _Executive_, and _Judiciary_. The mode of electing and\r\nthe powers of each branch vary in some states, but in all of them the\r\ninfluence of the people is supreme.\r\n\r\nWith governments, as with almost every thing else, there is a difference\r\nof opinion, and many individuals may dislike the republican form and\r\ndemocratic tone which prevail in the states. In such a state of things\r\nit is, however, certain, that the interests of the many never can be\r\nsacrificed for the advantage of the few, and that the laws, taxation,\r\nand expenditure of the country must accord with the wishes of the\r\npeople. Whatever creed emigrants may have adopted, they can live\r\nunmolested, without joining in the turmoil of American politics. The\r\nfield of industry is open to their exertions, and its fruits may be\r\nenjoyed in peace and security.\r\n\r\nTravellers cannot deny the unspeakable advantages that have accrued to\r\nthe industry of the United States from the nature of their governments,\r\nand many of them, as if stung by envy, dilate on the instability of the\r\nUnion, and by the consequent convulsion see a termination of the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of the people. It is impossible to say what\r\nevents may be in the womb of futurity; but there is no rational ground\r\nfor supposing the dissolution of the Union by war is at hand. Almost all\r\nthe domestic wars which have taken place amongst civilized men, have\r\neither resulted from ambitious chiefs leading deluded and enslaved\r\nfollowers against each other, or from resistance to tyranny. In the\r\nregion of the United States, to which my remarks are applicable, tyranny\r\nin any shape can scarcely be said to exist; and should ambitious men\r\ntake the field, where are they to obtain followers? But supposing war to\r\nhappen, and that the democrats of America copiously shed each other’s\r\nblood, are the aristocrats and serviles of Europe exempt from such\r\nbarbarism? The emigrant may calculate on peace from the love the people\r\nhave for their government, the absence of aristocracy and abject\r\npoverty, and unfettered industry. Should he, however, shun the United\r\nStates, from apprehension of intestine war, in what part of the world\r\nwill he seek a retreat?\r\n\r\nI alluded to the contrast between the United States and Upper Canada, as\r\nwitnessed near the frontier on each side of the river Niagara. After\r\nhaving had an opportunity of seeing extensively both countries, I\r\nconsider my first opinions, as expressed at pages 95–96, to be\r\nsubstantially correct, although other causes may have operated in\r\nproducing the difference than the governments of the countries.\r\n\r\nIt may be perfectly true “the people, soil, and climate, were originally\r\nalike” on both sides of the Niagara, but the United States and Upper\r\nCanada cannot with propriety be contrasted by those spots alone. The\r\ninhabitants of the United States, generally speaking, may be said to\r\nhave been born in the country, and consequently possessed of the\r\npeculiar feelings and qualities of a people suited to a young country.\r\nOn the other hand, most of the inhabitants of Upper Canada are either\r\nthe descendants of the Royalists, slothful and unenterprising from the\r\nneglect with which they have been treated, or emigrants from Britain,\r\nwhere many of them had acquired notions and habits ill adapted for\r\nsettling a wood covered surface. Upper Canada having also become a place\r\nof refuge for the outcasts of other countries, and many of the settlers\r\nbeing composed of the poorest of the Irish and Scotch Highlanders, two\r\nof the most indolent and unambitious portions of civilized society,\r\nthere can be no question of the people of the United States being more\r\nindustrious and energetic than the inhabitants of Upper Canada. The\r\nUnited States sooner became peopled than Upper Canada, and may,\r\nconsequently, be said to be an older country. The climate of the States\r\nis generally also better than Upper Canada. If the view which I have\r\ntaken of the source of riches be correct, the United States, being an\r\nolder country, with a better climate, and a more industrious population\r\nthan Upper Canada, should also be wealthier. It will accordingly be\r\nfound that in all external appearances, such as villages, houses in the\r\ncountry, hotels, internal intercourse and trade, and the dress of the\r\npeople, Upper Canada is about a century behind the United States.\r\n\r\nThe governments of the several States and Upper Canada are alike in\r\nform, consisting of a governor and two deliberative assemblies. In the\r\nStates persons invested with power are chosen by the people. In Upper\r\nCanada the governor, the members of the highest assembly, and of the\r\njudiciary, are appointed by the King of Great Britain. The States may be\r\nsaid to have passed the youth of government and attained vigorous\r\nmanhood. The government of Upper Canada is still in the helplessness of\r\ninfancy, and cannot, in the nature of things, continue permanent in its\r\npresent state. Many people give a preference to Upper Canada because it\r\nis under the British government; but when emigrants reflect on the\r\nnature of the two governments, let them ask themselves what the British\r\ngovernment has done for them at home? What they expect from it in\r\nAmerica? And how long Upper Canada is likely to remain subject to\r\nBritain?\r\n\r\nEach of the United States forms an integral part of a large confederacy,\r\nand the advantages which the population derive from an extensive and\r\nunfettered commercial intercourse are great. Upper Canada is insulated.\r\nThe river St Lawrence forms its only channel of trade, and already\r\ndisputes have arisen with the Lower province about the imposts collected\r\non foreign commodities. In the event of the Union of the States being\r\ndissolved, the interests and feelings of the population would, in all\r\nprobability, lead to the formation of smaller unions, without disturbing\r\nthe governments of the separate states. When Upper Canada breaks, or is\r\nthrown off from Britain, what will be her situation? While the French\r\ninterest remains strong in Lower Canada a union of the two provinces\r\nwill not take place, and all intercourse with foreign nations would be\r\nat an end. The inhabitants of the Upper province, in such a state of\r\nthings, would be reduced to the necessity of subduing the Lower\r\nCanadians by force of arms, or begging of the United States to be\r\nadmitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the expenses of the federal government are\r\nimpartially levied throughout the Union, and the burdens of the\r\ngovernment of each State are paid by its own inhabitants. In every State\r\ncheap justice and free education are provided for the people; and\r\ntaxation is lighter, compared with the advantages enjoyed, than amongst\r\nany other independent people in the world. In Upper Canada a part of the\r\nexpenses of the country is paid by the people of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, who also bear the expense of defending the province. Free\r\neducation is not provided for the inhabitants. Taxation is at present\r\nalmost unfelt, which is owing to the British government. The people of\r\nBritain are not, however, likely to be long burdened with the expenses\r\nof the province, and when the inhabitants meet the expense of governing\r\nthemselves, taxation in Upper Canada will be augmented.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs of the people, as witnessed in public, are the\r\nsame in both countries. In all things there is much less refinement in\r\nUpper Canada, and the manners of the people are coarse contrasted with\r\nthose in the States. Morals seem to correspond with the manners. It was,\r\nhowever, the unfortunate emigrants from Britain and Ireland who imparted\r\nsuch a character to the population. Many individuals seemed to me\r\nconscious of self-debasement, and to have left home for the purpose of\r\nindulging their vicious propensities without encountering the scorn and\r\ncensure of their friends and relations. Should it be thought that I have\r\njudged harshly of some of my countrymen, let it be remembered I speak\r\nonly of what was observed in public, and that the bar-rooms of Upper\r\nCanada exhibited the worst part of British society without a redeeming\r\nfeature. The domestic manners and morals of the people of either country\r\ndid not come properly within the scope of my observation. I may,\r\nhowever, remark, that I was favourably impressed with the manners of the\r\nroyalist inhabitants of Canada, and it would be ungrateful on my part\r\nnot to acknowledge the uniform civility and kindness which I experienced\r\nin private from every class of settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the machinery of government is controlled by the\r\npeople, who do every thing for the welfare of the country, and political\r\npower is invested in worth and talent alone. In Upper Canada government\r\nis swayed by an aristocracy, who have never lost sight of their own\r\ninterest in legislating for the country. A higher and more uniform tone\r\nof independence and self-respect pervades the inhabitants in the United\r\nStates than in Canada. The emigrant who delights in lording over his\r\nfellow-mortals, and measures his importance and wealth by the servility\r\nand wretchedness of others around him, ought to shun the States. The\r\nemigrant who seeks a fair and favourable field for his industry, and\r\naspires to share, in common with his brethren, the just rank and\r\nprivileges of man, ought to shun Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThe United States are rapidly progressing, and their future prosperity\r\nseems illimitable. I ascertained there were eighteen large steam-boats\r\nbelonging to the States on lake Erie in 1833, and a gentleman, who was\r\nthere in 1834, assured me they had increased to twenty-four. By the\r\nofficial report of the Postmaster-General to the President of the United\r\nStates, the annual transportation of the mail was, in 1829, 13,700,000\r\nmiles, and in 1832, 23,625,021 miles. There is not one-tenth of the\r\nsurface yet devoted to the production of human food. The coal-fields of\r\nthe west are perhaps inexhaustible, the water communication is almost\r\nwithout limits, and the extent of canals and railroads already exceed\r\nthat of any other nation. The country is great even in its infancy. If\r\nits territory, consisting of 1,328,902,400 acres, were peopled to the\r\nsame degree as England, containing a great deal of land which cannot be\r\ncultivated, the inhabitants would amount to 537,872,383, while the\r\npresent population is about 14,000,000. A vast extent of the best soil,\r\nsituated in the finest climate, is still unoccupied, and if the views\r\nregarding the assistance nature affords the farmer, and his reward\r\naffecting wages of other labour, which I have already laid down, be\r\ncorrect, industry cannot fail of meeting with a rich reward for many\r\ncenturies yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe internal and external state of the country is free from molestation,\r\nand the principles of education and good government are so firmly\r\nestablished, and applicable to every condition that may arise, that\r\nnothing is likely to check the prosperity of the United States but\r\nfancied opposition of interests resulting from extent of territory. A\r\nstate of things will soon appear, however, to hold the Union together in\r\nspite of opposing interests. Between 37 and 45 degrees of north\r\nlatitude, and beyond 5 degrees of west longitude from Washington, lies\r\nthe most favoured region of North America. By inspecting a map it will\r\nbe seen this district is intersected in all directions by navigable\r\nrivers and other channels of commerce. The great outlet of the region is\r\nby the Mississippi to New Orleans. The river Ohio communicates with\r\nPhiladelphia and Baltimore by canals and railroads, and by canals and\r\nlake Erie with New York. The rivers Wabash, Illinois, Mississippi, and\r\nMissouri, will also, in progress of time, communicate with New York by\r\nthe Erie canal or other means. For reasons which will be afterwards\r\nstated, population must soon accumulate in this district, which\r\npossesses almost every thing within itself which can add to the wealth\r\nand greatness of a country. The chief power of the States will centre\r\nhere, and the interests of the inhabitants being interwoven with the\r\nmentioned seaports, they will insist on an observance of the Union,\r\nwhatever may be the views of the northern and southern states.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the States speak the same language as the English,\r\nwhich may be called the language of commerce. They are made acquainted\r\nwith the improvements and discoveries of Britain a few months after they\r\nbecome known, and from the freedom of institutions, and energy of the\r\npeople, greater effect can sometimes be given to them. On a general view\r\nof all the circumstances affecting the character and situation of the\r\ncountry and the people, it is scarcely possible to imagine a region\r\npromising such unchecked prosperity and future greatness.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada has made unparalleled advancement of late years, which is\r\nnot likely to continue at the present rate, as the causes of prosperity\r\nhave been altogether artificial. A great number of gallant men, after\r\nmeritoriously serving Britain in war, were placed on the half-pay list,\r\nin prime of life. Seeing no prospect of employment or farther\r\nadvancement in the profession of arms, many of them retired to Upper\r\nCanada, in hope of providing for their families, where they were\r\nassigned a grant of land. This class of emigrants cannot, however, be\r\nmuch augmented, and the chief source of value to the country of those\r\nalready settled—their annuities—will terminate with their lives. Of late\r\nyears, immense sums have been lavished unproductively by the British\r\nGovernment on canals and other works, and in paying public services,\r\nwhich cannot be continued in the existing state of things. A third\r\nsource of advancement has been the tens of thousands of individuals\r\nlured into the country from Britain by devices which will soon lose\r\ntheir influence, in consequence of a rival to the Canada Company having\r\nappeared in Lower Canada, under the title of the American Land Company.\r\nMany of the shareholders reside in Quebec and Montreal, who will employ\r\ntheir influence to prevent strangers proceeding to the Upper province.\r\nFrom these causes, which are temporary, and others formerly stated,\r\nthere is little reason to expect a continuance of the recent progression\r\nin Upper Canada. The country has, however, great advantages in water\r\ncommunication, which, in progress of time, will become useful to trade.\r\nThere is still much unoccupied land, a great part of which, however,\r\nlies in an unfavourable climate. From this circumstance, the monopoly of\r\nland, and its consequent high price, the reward of industry and wages of\r\nlabour are more likely to diminish than increase.\r\n\r\nThe position of Upper Canada in its external relations, which has been\r\nstated at page 413, must be considered unfavourable, and in the internal\r\ncondition of the country there is much which is unsatisfactory. The\r\nprovince is an appendage to Britain, and seems to have aped many of the\r\nfrailties of the mother country. The principle of government has been\r\npatronage; the rule of governing, enriching the few and despising the\r\nmany. Hence abuses in extensive grants of land, pensions, superfluous\r\noffices, an aristocracy, and such an aristocracy! a rapacious church,\r\nand the neglect of education. The institutions of Britain are a century\r\nbehind the intelligence of her inhabitants. Upper Canada is generations\r\nbehind North America in legislation. I have already said the government\r\nof the province is in helpless infancy, and add, it must pass through\r\nthe slippery paths of youth before attaining strength. There is already\r\ndiscord amongst the inhabitants, who are assailing the oligarchy under a\r\nsturdy, though not comprehensive minded, leader. The strife is likely to\r\nbe tedious, and without bloodshed; the poverty of the country and\r\ncharacter of the people being a sufficient guarantee against aggression\r\nor envy on the part of the United States, and the scattered condition of\r\nthe settlers a protection against themselves.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the movement party ought to be, to seek the aid of the\r\nmother country, and steadily but cautiously proceed with measures\r\ncalculated to cripple the aristocracy, the dominant church, and the\r\nCanada Company. These changes can only be lastingly and beneficially\r\neffected by extending the elective franchise, and providing free\r\neducation for the inhabitants. The ultimate policy of Upper Canada is to\r\ncourt a union with the United States, which would open channels of trade\r\nby way of New Orleans and New York.\r\n\r\nOn a general view of the circumstances affecting the country and people\r\nof Upper Canada, much time will be required to develope the resources of\r\nthe country; and a period of excitement is likely to intervene before a\r\npermanent government can be established.\r\n\r\nEvery thing in the United States seems to me to be resting on a natural\r\nand sure foundation, with prospect of continued prosperity. In Upper\r\nCanada, most things appear to be on an artificial footing, and must\r\nconsequently experience change. The States present a wider and a better\r\nfield for the exercise of industry than Upper Canada; and the British\r\nemigrant, who must live by his own exertions, makes a sacrifice of his\r\nimmediate interests, and in all probability the interests of his\r\nposterity, by preferring Upper Canada to the United States as a place of\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nMany people may prefer Canada to the States, from having friends already\r\nsettled there. Such a reason is not creditable to their friends in\r\nBritain, whom they leave behind. The person who makes up his mind to\r\nleave the place of his nativity, ought to employ his industry and\r\ncapital in the best field, and endeavour to bring his friends who may\r\nhave settled less fortunately to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  _Illinois—Climate—Face of the\r\n    country—Prairies—Soil—Salt—Lead—Iron—Coal—Water\r\n    Communication—History—Towns—Government—Education—Kentucky\r\n    Population—New Englanders—Pioneers—Manners and Customs._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the western United States, forming part of the extensive and\r\nfertile valley of the Mississippi, are so different in character from\r\nthe Eastern States and the Canadas for agricultural emigration, as to\r\nmerit particular consideration. The region alluded to lies north of\r\nlatitude 38°, and from 7° of west longitude from Washington to the rocky\r\nmountains. Much of this tract is imperfectly known, having never perhaps\r\nbeen trod by civilized man, and embraces the states of Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, and the Michigan, North-west, and Missouri\r\nterritories. My personal observation extended to a portion of four of\r\nthe mentioned divisions, which enabled me to form an opinion of their\r\ncharacteristics, which are said to be pretty uniform; and for the sake\r\nof precision Illinois shall be noticed.\r\n\r\nThe State of Illinois extends from north latitude 37° to 42½°, and from\r\nwest longitude 10° 35′ to 14° 25′. It is bounded on the south by the\r\nriver Ohio, on the west by the Mississippi, on the north by the\r\nnorth-west territory, and on the east by lake Michigan and Indiana. The\r\nlength is 382 miles, the area 57,900 square miles, or 37,056,000 acres,\r\nwhich is nearly the size of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Illinois partakes of the general character of North\r\nAmerica, but from the absence of hills, and small elevation above the\r\nlevel of the sea, this region is milder than any other of the same\r\nlatitude, The winter in the southern parts seldom exceeds six weeks. At\r\nShawneetown, which is in the southern part of the State, the average\r\ntemperature of July, in 1819, was 87°, of December 43°, and the mean\r\nannual temperature 64°. At Prairies des Chiens, which is a few miles\r\nbeyond the northern boundary of the State, the temperature in July 1820\r\nwas 74°, in December 16°, and the average of the year 48° 5ʹ.[6]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Melish’s View of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe diseases in Illinois are such as are common to the upper Mississippi\r\nvalley, amongst which intermitting and remitting bilious fevers often\r\noccur. From the variations of temperature, inflammatory complaints and\r\ndiseases of the lungs are frequent in this and almost every other part\r\nof North America. I met several young men, suffering under consumption,\r\ntravelling in the steam-boats of the west, although this malady is much\r\nmore frequent in the eastern states. By an official report of the deaths\r\nin the city of New York, from 24th November to 1st December, 1832, in a\r\nnewspaper lying before me, 14 cases of consumption, out of a total of\r\n92, are recorded, which is the highest number of any disease on the\r\nlist; and the same paper states 5 of consumption, out of 62, at\r\nPhiladelphia, which occurred during the previous week. Fever, dyspepsia,\r\nand consumption, are the maladies of Illinois, the two first being most\r\ncommon in the south, and the latter in the north. The health of an\r\nemigrant may, in some measure, be preserved by care. Exposure to sudden\r\nchanges of temperature without proper clothing, and uncomfortable houses\r\nin inclement weather, seldom fail of engendering disease.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the Ohio, in the south-west angle of the state, being about\r\n300 feet above the level of the sea, and lake Michigan, in the\r\nnorth-east angle, being 589 feet, while there is no range of hills or\r\nelevated ground intervening, the surface of the country must necessarily\r\nbe level, which is more particularly the case towards the southern part\r\nof the state. The rivers, which intersect the country in every\r\ndirection, have formed deep channels for the conveyance of water, and no\r\ngreat extent of the surface is marshy. The space which I travelled over\r\non foot, between Chicago, on lake Michigan, and the village of\r\nSpringfield in Sangamon county, a distance of about 200 miles, the\r\nsurface, with exception of a few miles at the commencement and\r\ntermination of the journey, was undulating, the swells being long and\r\nconsiderable, without a lake, pond, or marsh being visible, except in\r\none instance. On approaching Springfield, the surface became level\r\nwithout being wet, and from this village until I crossed the Mississippi\r\nthe wettest parts of the surface might have been rendered dry by the\r\nordinary means of ditching.\r\n\r\nThe feature in the surface of Illinois, which chiefly distinguishes it\r\nfrom the eastern states and the Canadas, is the prairies, or tracts\r\nwhich are free from timber. I imagine prairies to be natural\r\nproductions; they may be termed grass fields, and are of every size and\r\nshape, being separated from each other by tracts of forest. Americans,\r\nwhose ideas of an uninhabited country are associated with interminable\r\nforests, have speculated on the origin of prairies, which they regard as\r\nan anomaly in nature, and assign their existence to man. A Scotchman,\r\naccustomed to the bleak naked mountains, and artificial forests of his\r\nown country, may take an opposite view of a prairie, and support his\r\nopinion by the state of the earth’s surface after the flood, which would\r\nbe without trees. But the forest and prairie surfaces of Illinois stand\r\nin the relation of water and land on the face of the earth, both being\r\nthe handiwork of nature, and forming bays, peninsulas, straits,\r\nisthmuses, lakes, islands, and every other form of outline which charm\r\nthe eye and delight the imagination. To the individual who has long been\r\nimmured in the forest, the effect of prairie scenery is enchanting; and\r\nthe inhabitant of a cultivated and thickly peopled country, who can gaze\r\non the lovely, the lonely, and the rich prairies of Illinois without\r\nemotion towards God and his fellow-creatures must be void of feeling.\r\n\r\nThe different published accounts of Illinois represent one-half of the\r\nsurface of the state to be prairie, but it is probable none of the\r\nwriters, or any one individual, has had a proper opportunity of forming\r\nan opinion on the subject. In the course of my journey,\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the country appeared to be prairie; but the\r\nforest tract is chiefly in the south, which I did not visit. It is\r\nhowever certain a vast extent of prairie lies north of latitude 39°. An\r\nEnglish traveller informed me he found the prairie country unchanged 500\r\nmiles to the west of Illinois. And if such is the case, its breadth in\r\nlatitude 40° will exceed 1000 miles.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable extent of the surface thinly covered with trees,\r\ninterspersed with the same kind of herbage as clothes the prairies,\r\ncalled barrens, or oak-openings, from the wood which grows on them. They\r\nmay either be considered thin forest, or wooded prairie, as they partake\r\nof the nature of both; but in an agricultural point of view, they must\r\nbe classed as prairie, from the herbage they afford. The soil of\r\nIllinois, like many other parts of the world which has come under my\r\nnotice, is variable, and the different habitations of the varieties of\r\nsunflower and other tall-growing plants, often distinctly marked changes\r\nof soil on the prairie. The prevailing soil between Chicago and\r\nSpringfield, was black sandy loam, and occasionally considerable tracts\r\nof clay or heavy loam intervened. In this distance of nearly 200 miles,\r\nI did not pass over, in all, 10 miles of bad soil, which was light\r\ncoloured sand. The surface, which is forest, oak-openings, or prairie,\r\nhas no relation to quality of soil, all of which abound with soils of\r\nevery description.\r\n\r\nOn no part of the prairie did I observe heath, or other thriftless\r\nvegetation, occupying the entire surface, with exception of a dwarfish\r\nspecies of hazel, in a few instances, to a limited extent. Besides the\r\nmany beautiful flowering plants which adorn the prairies, they are\r\ncovered with four or five tall-growing kinds of grass, and the moist and\r\ndry soils could be distinguished by the luxuriance of different species.\r\nFrom the grass attaining between three and four feet in height, and\r\nbeing seared by a powerful sun, the surface of the prairies is scorched\r\nby fire every autumn, originating by human, and, it is presumed, also\r\noccasionally by natural means. The annual burning seems to have\r\ndestroyed all the grasses which possess fibrous roots, and are\r\npropagated by seed; those which at present exist having strong roots,\r\nwhich resist the effects of fire, and propagate themselves without seed.\r\nThis property of the grasses is illustrative of the economy of nature,\r\nby furnishing plants for every situation and circumstance that may\r\narise. The burning is not attended with much danger, as the turning of\r\none or two sods by the plough is deemed a sufficient protection against\r\nfire for a hay stack in the midst of the prairie; and the inhabitants\r\neither save their buildings by this means, or by burning the grass\r\nimmediately around them, before the general conflagration takes place.\r\nThe burning, in all probability, is conducive to health, by consuming\r\nvegetation, which would otherwise putrify on the surface, and by\r\nchecking the luxuriance of its growth, which the unconsumed matter would\r\nproduce by natural decay. There is a ruling Providence in every thing!\r\n\r\nThe mineral productions of the state have been imperfectly explored.\r\nSalt is manufactured in many situations. Near Shawneetown is the most\r\nextensive establishment, where about 138,000 bushels are made yearly.\r\nSalt is also made in the neighbourhood of Brownsville, in Madison\r\ncounty, and in other parts. The saline reservations given to the state,\r\nby the general government, consist of 206,128 acres. One of the most\r\nremarkable gifts which bountiful nature has lavished on the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi, appears to me to be the inexhaustible supply of salt\r\nwater. The government of the country seem fully to appreciate the gift,\r\nand have wisely made the springs public property, by which the community\r\nwill obtain the indispensable article of salt at the cheapest rate.\r\n\r\nLead abounds in the north-east angle of the state, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Galena. The mineral is found on both sides of the Mississippi, and\r\nsupposed to extend over several thousand square miles. The ore is found\r\nin detached masses, and not in veins, which renders the digging a matter\r\nof chance. The quantity of lead manufactured here, in 1829, was\r\n13,343,150 lbs.; and the population of the region is stated at\r\n10,000.[7] There are also lead diggings in the State of Missouri, about\r\n70 miles south-west of St Louis, and which were wrought by the French\r\nabout a century ago. The price of lead, at Galena, is from 2 to 3 cents\r\nper lb. When at Springfield, I met a young gentleman from Leith, in\r\nScotland, who had travelled by way of New York, the Erie canal, and lake\r\nMichigan, provided with a considerable quantity of shot, which he\r\nimagined the country could not furnish.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Guide to the valley of Mississippi. Philadelphia, 1832.\r\n\r\nIron ore is said to exist in the southern part of the state; and copper\r\nore in the lead region around Galena. But I believe neither of them have\r\nbeen manufactured.\r\n\r\nCoal, of bituminous quality, has been found on the banks of the\r\nprincipal rivers, in different parts of the state, and, from having been\r\nseen on the banks of the river Missouri, it is supposed to extend over\r\nthe whole of the upper part of the Mississippi valley. But, in the\r\npresent state of the country, no particular examination of the field has\r\nbeen made. Coal has, however, been wrought in many places on the banks\r\nof rivers by quarrying; and is found above the level of the waters.\r\nSeveral steam-mills, at St Louis, use coal for fuel.\r\n\r\nIron is manufactured in Wabash county, and limestone is found over the\r\nwhole State. I observed abundance of sandstone in the channel of the\r\nIllinois; and perhaps almost every mineral which is useful to man will\r\nbe found on examination.\r\n\r\nIllinois is favourably situated for water communication, the interior of\r\nthe state being intersected by the Kaskaskia, Rock, and Illinois rivers,\r\nwhich are navigable at all seasons of the year. The State is said to\r\ncontain between three and four thousand miles of boatable waters, a\r\ndescription of navigation which cannot be well defined, as every rill,\r\nin so level a country, will float a boat of small size, on melting of\r\nthe snow in spring. There is no doubt, however, of the water\r\ncommunication being extensive, which will be farther improved by\r\nconnecting the navigable point of the Illinois with lake Michigan. To\r\nthe formation of a canal for this purpose, Congress granted the State\r\n480,000 acres of land. The undertaking has not been commenced; and the\r\nextent of rock discovered in the intended line, may render a railroad\r\nnecessary. The navigable rivers Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi form the\r\nboundaries of three sides, and lake Michigan is on the fourth. The\r\nexternal communication is as remarkable as the internal.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi connects the State of Illinois with New Orleans to the\r\nsouth; the Ohio opens a communication with Baltimore, Philadelphia, and\r\nNew York to the west. To the north, lake Michigan communicates with lake\r\nSuperior and the world of waters which flow into the gulf of St\r\nLawrence. The western communication, by the Missouri, is only limited by\r\ncivilisation, a steam-boat belonging to the American Fur Company having\r\nsailed 1400 miles up the river, from its junction with the Mississippi.\r\nSo little is known about the western sources of the Missouri, that the\r\nlimits of navigation, in this direction, must at present be conjectural;\r\nand it does not seem to require a stretch of imagination to conceive, as\r\npopulation advances, a communication opened between the head waters of\r\nthis river and the Pacific ocean. Should such an event take place, the\r\nempires of China, Japan, and Russia will be brought near, and Illinois\r\nbecome one of the most central and favourable trading situations in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIllinois was originally discovered by the French, who penetrated by way\r\nof Canada, in 1673. They founded the villages of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and\r\nothers in 1683. When the country became part of the United States, it\r\nformed part of the territory north-west of the Ohio. In 1801, it was\r\nincluded with Indiana as a territory. In 1809, it was made a separate\r\nterritory. And became one of the United States in 1818.\r\n\r\nIn so recent a settled country, large towns cannot be expected to be\r\nfound. Vandalia is the capital, and, like other capitals, situated near\r\nthe centre of the state. It stands on the western bank of the Kaskaskia,\r\nand was founded in 1821. The population is stated at 500 souls.\r\n\r\nShawneetown on the Ohio, about nine miles below the mouth of the Wabash,\r\nis the largest town in the State. A number of thriving villages are\r\nrising in every direction, and will acquire population according to\r\ntheir situations for trade. Galena, situated on Fever river, a few miles\r\nabove its junction with the Mississippi, and in the north-west corner of\r\nthe State, will rise into importance, from the manufacture of lead in\r\nthe neighbourhood. One hundred steam-boat arrivals at this place are\r\nsaid to have occurred within the year. Chicago on lake Michigan, and\r\nOttawa on the Illinois, from being situated at the termination of the\r\ncommunication connecting these waters, will become important places.\r\nAlton, situated on the Mississippi, one mile above the mouth of the\r\nMissouri, and sixteen below the entrance of the Illinois, is centrically\r\nsituated for trade, and is soon likely to become the chief shipping port\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Illinois is vested in a General Assembly, consisting\r\nof a Senate and House of Representatives. The members of Senate are\r\nelected for four years, and the representatives for two years. The pay\r\nof the members of each branch of the legislature is $3 a-day. The right\r\nof suffrage is vested in all free whites twenty-one years of age, and\r\nwho have resided six months in the State. The votes are given _viva\r\nvoce_.[8]\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Mellish’s View.\r\n\r\nThe executive is vested in a governor and lieutenant-governor, both\r\nelected for four years. The governor’s salary is $1000, or L.212, 10s.\r\nsterling a-year.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary consists of a chief-justice, and three associate-judges,\r\nwho hold circuit courts. Their salaries are $1000 each.\r\n\r\nThe taxes are levied by three commissioners in each county. Justices of\r\nthe peace are elected by the people every four years, and their\r\njurisdiction extends over inferior cases. Each county has a judge of\r\nprobate, before whom business relating to wills is transacted.\r\n\r\nThere is no imprisonment for debt, except in case of fraud or refusal on\r\nthe part of the debtor to deliver up his property for the behoof of his\r\ncreditors. There are no usury laws. And slavery is not allowed since the\r\nadoption of the constitution.\r\n\r\nThere are fifty-eight counties, and a considerable portion of the\r\nnorthern part of the State has not been surveyed, which was sold by the\r\nIndians in 1833. The population, in 1800, consisted of 12,282. In 1830,\r\nthere were 157,445 inhabitants; and, from the recent emigration, their\r\nnumbers must now exceed 200,000.\r\n\r\nCongress granted to the State, for the purposes of education, one\r\nthirty-sixth part of the public land, or 977,457 acres, and 3 per cent\r\non the sales of land. So there can be no doubt of an efficient system of\r\ncommon free schools being established, wherever the wants of the\r\npopulation require them. Besides the grant for common schools, 46,080\r\nacres of land have been granted for colleges. Such an institution was\r\nestablished at Jacksonville in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe population of Illinois embraces settlers from almost every State in\r\nthe Union, and every country in Europe. The inhabitants of the south,\r\nare understood to have come from Kentucky, a slave-holding State, and\r\nwere induced to settle in this district from their dislike of slavery.\r\nThe emigrating Kentuckians approving of slavery, take up their residence\r\nin the adjoining State of Missouri, where this bondage is tolerated. The\r\nKentuckians possess different dispositions from the inhabitants of the\r\nother States, and, like the New Englanders, they seem to inherit the\r\ncharacters of their forefathers. The first settlers of Kentucky, for a\r\nperiod of between thirty and forty years, waged a cruel and savage\r\nwarfare with the Indians. Many thousands perished in the strife, and the\r\nfeatures which such a mode of life could not fail of imparting to their\r\ncharacters, have descended, with some modification, to their progeny.\r\nThe Kentuckians of the present day are men of warm temperament,\r\nhigh-souled, and fearless; but, at the same time, generous and\r\nhospitable in the extreme. They have been termed the Irishmen of\r\nAmerica. With ill-regulated tempers, they can have little medium of\r\ncharacter, and will be good or bad members of society, according to the\r\nprinciples they have imbibed. The Kentuckians are said to go armed with\r\nknives, a practice which is thought to be on the decline, and which I\r\ncannot corroborate from observation. This practice has in all\r\nprobability descended from the first settlers, and would originate from\r\nthe unfortunate circumstances in which they were placed. A few boys in\r\nBritain, who mistake true honour and courage, provide themselves with\r\npistols and sword-sticks. Perhaps only the fiery youths of Kentucky wear\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Illinois almost all the inhabitants appeared to\r\nhave come from New England, and possessed the characteristics of that\r\npeople. During my intercourse with them I received some impressions of\r\ntheir dispositions and movements at variance with what I had been led to\r\nexpect. It has been usual to represent this people void of the best\r\nfeelings of humanity—the parent with little affection for his\r\noffspring—the boy without filial love, impatient of restraint, and\r\nscampering off from school to obtain independence in the distant\r\nwilderness. But when I found many unmarried young men, after twelve\r\nmonths’ residence in Illinois, anxiously expecting the arrival of their\r\nparents from New England, and had travelled with old people journeying\r\nfrom that country to join their sons in Illinois, I attributed the\r\nmoving of youth to the western districts to the best of motives, and\r\nassigned to both parties the feelings of domestic affection. The youth\r\nof Britain do not engage in the bustle of the world so early as the\r\nAmericans, and family intercourse is consequently more enduring. But it\r\nis the difficulty of earning a subsistence and not affection, which\r\nbinds the young men of Britain to the roof of their parents, and in all\r\nprobability the emotions of the heart are the same in both countries.\r\n\r\nA class of men are said to precede civilisation in America, called\r\npioneers or squatters, and have been described by travellers as\r\ndemi-savages, blackened with iniquity, and shunning their fellow\r\nmortals, by moving to a more remote station, as settlers advance. It is\r\nprobable such beings did at one time exist, and may still occasionally\r\nbe met with in the lower part of the Mississippi valley. They may be\r\nsupposed to have originated in such a state of things as occurred at the\r\nfirst settlement of Kentucky, and perhaps were altogether confined to\r\nthe latitude of this State. In the present day, when the east is densely\r\npeopled, and civilisation in the region of Illinois has reached an open\r\ncountry, desperate characters are more likely to find subsistence and\r\nconcealment in the crowded city than in the prairie. Be this as it may,\r\nthere are no such characters in the northern parts of Illinois as the\r\npioneers of old, and I regard the present frontier men of the prairie as\r\none of the best and most enterprising portions of the western\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs of Illinois have been described by Mr Stuart in\r\nhis “Three Years in North America,” in terms and spirit so different\r\nfrom almost any thing that is noticed in the work, that I shall quote\r\npart of his remarks.\r\n\r\n“I made enquiry on the road from some passengers, as to the hotels at\r\nJacksonville, and was told there were two, neither of them good, but\r\nthat Bentley’s was the best. I found, on going into the house, that the\r\ntea and supper were nearly finished; and it was not without some\r\ndifficulty, and rather uninviting looks from a young lady who was acting\r\nas waiter, that I procured a fresh supply of coffee and eggs. This was\r\nSaturday evening, and the young ladies, after having cleared the table\r\nand again covered it with the necessary articles, sat down to their meal\r\nwith me, on a footing of the most perfect equality. I found them very\r\ninquisitive, far more so than any of the New Englanders I ever met with,\r\nbut I afterwards learned that these people had lately come from a remote\r\npart of the country, where probably there were no schools. Such silly\r\nconduct, in respect to their own interest, as they were guilty of during\r\nthe forty-eight hours I remained with them, is generally the offspring\r\nof ignorance. I found the hotel-keeper a masterpiece of rudeness, and\r\nvery soon got a candle and retired to my bedroom. I was told the\r\nbreakfast hour was half past seven, but I started from my pillow on the\r\nfollowing morning at six, when I heard other people stirring so early,\r\nand the breakfast had commenced before I was able to get to the parlour.\r\nI asked how this happened; but I found from the answer that it was quite\r\nunnecessary to have any farther discussion with such a barbarian as\r\nSquire Bentley. He did not care for the customs of the British. His\r\nforefathers had left England to avoid tyranny, and they did not care for\r\nseeing foreigners here.\r\n\r\n“The tea and supper at the hotel in the evening was even a more\r\nridiculously managed meal, than any of those which preceded it. The\r\nfemale waiter, it being Sunday evening, was particularly smartly\r\ndressed, and sat at the end of the table and at some distance from it,\r\nmuch more intent on placing one leg above the other in a proper position\r\nfor showing her foot and ankle than in giving the necessary attendance\r\nat the tea-table—but she was such a good-humoured ‘romp-loving looking\r\nMiss,’ that though she did any thing rather than attend to her duty, I\r\nbelieve she was the most popular of all the hotel family with the\r\nstrangers. Every thing was bad, and the hotel people completely lost\r\ntemper when they noticed that we did not even find fault with them, but\r\nlaughed at the absurdity of being so treated. Even the bread was\r\nexecrable—a most uncommon occurrence in the United States. I soon left\r\nthe supper-table, and when sitting in my thinly boarded room, heard the\r\nlandlord tell a traveller who had recently arrived, at ten minutes past\r\nnine in the evening, that he must go to bed—he could not wait longer to\r\nshow him his room. Candlesticks seemed never to have been\r\ncleaned—snuffers were wanting—and as for shoes, there was no one to\r\nclean them while I was in the house.\r\n\r\n“At an early hour on the following morning, the 3d May, I left\r\nJacksonville, not without thanking Tom Bentley for his civility, and\r\ntelling him how utterly unfit he was for his situation.\r\n\r\n“Springfield is a straggling village, somewhat longer than Jacksonville,\r\nbut the situation is not at all equal to it in point of beauty or\r\ninterest. The hotel was very nearly as bad as that at Jacksonville.\r\nHornden was the name of the landlord. It was difficult to say whether\r\nhe, his wife, or his daughter was the sauciest. They certainly were as\r\nrude untutored Americans as I have seen. The lady undertook to wash some\r\nlinen for me, and there was no difficulty about it—as I got to her house\r\nearly in the afternoon—but she delayed and delayed so, that I was\r\nobliged to carry them away only half dried next morning after seven\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune to visit Springfield and Jacksonville, without being\r\naware at the time of Mr Stuart’s remarks, and my treatment seems to have\r\nbeen very different from what he describes. At Springfield I put up at\r\nthe hotel in which Mr Stuart lodged, and refer to page 241 for the\r\nparticulars of my reception. In the interval between his excursion and\r\nmine, the hotel had changed proprietors—and I found no difficulty in\r\ngetting linens washed and shoes cleaned. Every individual connected with\r\nthe house was attentive and civil.\r\n\r\nMy intercourse with Jacksonville was of short duration, and I have no\r\nmeans of ascertaining if I entered Bentley’s hotel. The house in which I\r\ntook coffee was situated on the north side of the square, and in all\r\nrespects greatly superior to the hotel at Springfield. A smart waiter\r\nattended the stage passengers during coffee, and the hotel keeper\r\nhimself was looking after his business at 2 o’clock in the morning, when\r\nthe mail started with us.\r\n\r\nMr Stuart mentions two female waiters having seated themselves at table\r\nwith him at Jacksonville, “on a footing of the most perfect equality.”\r\nThroughout the whole of my intercourse with the United States, no female\r\nwaiter or help of any degree seated herself at table, or even in the\r\nroom of a hotel when I was present, and I am unable to determine whether\r\nthis was the result of accident or design. Perhaps the young ladies may\r\nhave disdained to honour me with their company. Mr Stuart’s treatment on\r\nhis arrival at Jacksonville, admits of easy explanation. By his own\r\naccount, “on going into the house tea and supper were nearly finished,”\r\nand it was with some difficulty he was admitted to a second table, at\r\nwhich the establishments of western hotels sit down. Mr Stuart had\r\nrefused to seat himself with the rest of the company at the first table,\r\nand in fairness ought to be considered an obtruder at the second one. On\r\nhis arrival he plainly showed that he considered himself somewhat\r\ndifferent from the guests of the hotel, by not sitting down at table. If\r\ninferior to them it was right he should mess with the establishment, and\r\nif he had assumed superiority over them, it was right so to punish his\r\narrogance. In either case he met with his desert. Travellers in America\r\nmay derive instruction from his fate. The individual who moves,\r\nsnail-like, in a foreign land, canopied with the manners and customs of\r\nhis own country, and marking his route with the slime of prejudice, need\r\nnot expect civility from the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident Mr Stuart had been playing the _great man_ in this\r\npart of the country. His demand of fresh coffee and eggs in the evening,\r\nhis questions about breakfast next morning, his allegation that “the\r\nhotel people completely lost temper when they noticed that we did not\r\neven find fault with them,” and that the female waiter put forth her\r\nfoot and ankle for his admiration, all denote in a high degree\r\nself-importance.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter of Mr Stuart’s work there is the following\r\nextract from Professor Silliman, when alluding to an inn in Connecticut.\r\n\r\n“This is a peculiarity in the manners of this country not easily\r\nunderstood by a foreigner, and especially by an Englishman. Such a\r\nperson, if uninstructed in the genius of the country, almost of course\r\npresumes that all those he sees in public houses are in servile\r\nsituations. If he adopt towards them imperious and harsh language he\r\ngives offence, and produces coldness and possibly resentment, so that\r\nthe interview ends in mutual dissatisfaction. If the traveller should\r\nwrite a book he of course enlarges on the rudeness of American manners,\r\nand it is very possible that even the servants of our inns may give him\r\nsome occasion for such remarks, if they are treated as persons of their\r\ncondition commonly are in Europe.” Mr Stuart seems to have forgotten\r\nthis sensible quotation while in Illinois, and I have no doubt had\r\nhimself to blame for any rudeness he may have experienced. The heart is\r\nthe source of true politeness, which is often better conveyed by\r\nexpression of feature or tone of voice, than by words or gestures. The\r\npossessor of such civility is incapable of, and invulnerable to,\r\nrudeness, and will be well received in every part of the world. At the\r\ntime Mr Stuart told Tom Bentley “how utterly unfit he was for his\r\nsituation,” he himself committed a flagrant outrage on decorum, and\r\njustly merited any treatment that could have been bestowed on him. There\r\nis a ludicrous anecdote related at Springfield of his demands on\r\nHornden, which, if true, shows how unlikely it was any American landlord\r\ncould comply with them.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs of a people, like objects in a landscape, may be\r\ncoloured by the medium of vision, and they will not only appear\r\ndifferent to individuals, but seemingly vary to the same individual\r\naccording as his feelings may alter. It is evident Mr Stuart was out of\r\nhumour both at Jacksonville and Springfield, and could not have been a\r\ndispassionate judge of what was passing around him. His situation and\r\nmine in Illinois must have been very different. He had travelled for\r\nsome time before in slave-holding countries, where he had fared\r\nsumptuously on canvass-backed ducks and other delicacies, attended by\r\ncrouching and despised creatures. For many weeks I had sojourned in the\r\nrudest parts of Upper Canada, Indiana, and Illinois, leading a\r\ndemi-savage life, and faring, as it were, by the way sides. He was\r\ntravelling with a carriage and pair, accompanied by a store of venison\r\nhams, and whisky. I trudged on foot, quenching my thirst with\r\nindifferent water, and occasionally satisfying my hunger with nuts.\r\nJacksonville and Springfield must necessarily have presented less\r\nrefinement, luxury, and humiliation than he had been accustomed to, and\r\nmore civilisation and comfort than I had for some time experienced. From\r\nthe state of my feelings consequent on such a transition, it is possible\r\nI may have seen things in too favourable a light, and the truth may\r\nperhaps be found to lie somewhere between Mr Stuart’s account and mine.\r\n\r\nReferring to what has been stated at pages 400, 401, and 403, regarding\r\nthe amount of the population of the United States, and the progress of\r\nwealth and refinement, it would be unreasonable to expect luxury in so\r\nyoung a country as Illinois, or to subject the manners and customs of\r\nits inhabitants to serious criticism. Indeed it will appear evident to\r\nevery reflecting mind, that such a motley population, scattered over an\r\nextensive territory, cannot yet have amalgamated in feeling or custom,\r\nand that the manners of the different parts of the state will be as\r\nvaried as the origin of their population. Rudeness and vulgarity are not\r\nattributes of the native population of the United States; and if found\r\nin Illinois, they must be imports from foreign countries. The\r\ncircumstances of the State with regard to refinement are favourable to\r\nyoung men entering on life. But every emigrant on leaving Britain must\r\nlay his account with a change, to whatever part of the world he\r\nproceeds; and if he dislike the manners of the people of Illinois, he\r\ncan live in retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  _Productions—Animals—Fowls—Country for Sporting—Mode of Selling\r\n    Land—Unsold Public Land—Number of Indians—Government\r\n    policy towards the Indians— War with Indians—Decrease of\r\n    Population—Agriculture—Wages of Labour—Illinois and Upper Canada._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe productions of Illinois are numerous, including wheat, Indian corn,\r\ntobacco, Irish and sweet potatoes, and the castor bean from which oil is\r\nexpressed. Cotton and wine are said to be productions of the southern\r\nparts. Almost every kind of fruit attains perfection. Honey is obtained\r\nin great quantities both from wild and domesticated bees, which gather\r\nsweets from the prairie flowers.\r\n\r\nThe wild animals include bears; grey, black, and prairie wolves; two\r\nvarieties of the fox; rabbits, &c. &c. Deer are very numerous throughout\r\nthe state. The hare is not found in North America.\r\n\r\nThe wild-fowl embrace geese, ducks, turkeys, and quails in endless\r\nnumbers. The ruffed grouse, or prairie hen, is very plentiful, and one\r\nof the finest of game birds. While walking from Chicago I observed them\r\noften singly, and seldom more than two or three together. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Springfield they were in flocks of from sixty to\r\nseventy, scattered over a considerable space while feeding, and, when\r\ndisturbed, rising on wing without concert, in the manner of the British\r\npheasant.\r\n\r\nThe prairies of Illinois seem to me the only good sporting country I saw\r\nin America. The ruffed grouse, in size and mode of flying, resemble the\r\nblack-cock of Britain, and are every where in great numbers. Quails may\r\nbe as easily shot as sparrows in England, and there are abundance of\r\ndeer. Fox-hunting might be pursued at a rattling pace over the prairie,\r\nwhich does not present an interruption of any description, and would\r\nliterally form a fox-race. The deer and prairie wolf might be hunted\r\nwith dogs, or shot, according to fancy. I recommend the upper\r\nMississippi valley to British sportsmen, as a country likely to afford\r\nthem amusement and instruction. A person may cross the Atlantic with a\r\nbrace of dogs in one of the best vessels, and travel to the prairies,\r\nand devote a year to the excursion, living in the best style the country\r\naffords, for the sum of L.200 sterling. If he were economical in\r\ncrossing the ocean, and living with settlers, and serving himself while\r\nin Illinois, the expense would be under L.120.\r\n\r\nThe mode of selling government land in Illinois, is the same as in the\r\nother parts of the Union. When a tract has been surveyed, and brought\r\ninto the market for settlement, it is advertised, and a day and place of\r\nsale fixed. Lots are put up and sold to the highest bidder for ready\r\nmoney. The tracts generally consist of millions of acres, and the sale\r\nis continued from day to day while individuals call for particular lots.\r\nWhen purchasers are satisfied, a public land-office is opened for the\r\nsale of the remainder, the price of which is invariably $1¼, or 5s. 3¾d.\r\nsterling per acre. A person wishing land goes to the land-office and\r\nselects any lot which pleases him. There is no form of application or\r\ninterest necessary, title-deeds and possession being immediately\r\nobtained on payment of the purchase money. Government land is never sold\r\non credit, and there is no fee of office, nor any other expense, on\r\nreceiving titles.\r\n\r\nFormerly the price of land was $2 per acre; one-fourth was paid at the\r\ntime of purchase, one-fourth at the end of two years, one-fourth at\r\nthree years, and the remaining fourth at four years. It was, however,\r\nfound that much of the price of land sold on credit could not be\r\nrecovered. An act of Congress was passed, limiting the price in future\r\nto $1¼ per acre, ready money, and the purchasers in arrears were\r\ndispossessed of a part of their lands. With this example on record, it\r\nmay appear somewhat singular that land should continue to be sold on\r\ncredit in Canada. It seems, however, the policy in that country to\r\nenrich the aristocracy at the expense of the poor; and selling\r\nhigh-priced land on credit is one of the most effectual means that could\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nThere were 28,237,850 acres of unsold public land in Illinois in 1832,\r\nand upwards of 3,000,000 acres recently sold by the Pottowatomy Indians\r\nhave since come into the market. By far the greater portion of this\r\nextensive surface is prairie, on which cattle and sheep might be\r\npastured without challenge, and the whole is open to the selection of\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nThe following estimate of unoccupied land, belonging to the United\r\nStates Government, is taken from Mellish’s View, published in 1822.\r\n\r\n                                           ACRES.\r\n                   Ohio,                   9,000,000\r\n                   Indiana,               10,000,000\r\n                   Illinois,              30,000,000\r\n                   Missouri,              15,000,000\r\n                   Alabama,               12,000,000\r\n                   Mississippi,            6,000,000\r\n                   Louisiana,             10,000,000\r\n                   Michigan territory,     4,000,000\r\n                   North-west territory,   2,000,000\r\n                   Arkansas territory,    15,000,000\r\n                                         ———————————\r\n                   Total,                113,000,000\r\n\r\nIn addition to the public lands above stated, the United States hold the\r\npreemption right, or exclusive right of purchasing from the Indians\r\ntracts lying in several of the States and territories mentioned, and in\r\nthe immense territory of Missouri, the aggregate extent of which may be\r\nstated at not less than 1,000,000,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe number of Indians in the valley of the Mississippi, which includes\r\nnearly all that reside on the United States’ territory, is not\r\naccurately known.

In changing the system it would seem as if a full\r\ncontemplation of the consequences of the change had not been taken. We\r\nhave been far more successful in the acquisition of their lands than\r\nimparting to them the principles, or inspiring them with the spirit of\r\ncivilisation. But in apportioning to ourselves their hunting grounds, we\r\nhave brought on ourselves the obligation of providing them with\r\nsubsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of teaching them\r\nthe arts of civilisation and the doctrines of Christianity, we have\r\nunexpectedly found them forming, in the midst of ourselves, communities,\r\nclaiming to be independent of ours, and rivals of sovereignty, within\r\nthe territories of the members of the Union. This state of things\r\nrequires that a remedy should be provided—a remedy which, while it shall\r\ndo justice to the unfortunate children of nature, may secure to the\r\nmembers of our confederation their rights of sovereignty and of soil. As\r\nan outline of a project to that effect, the views presented in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War are recommended to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n“The most important feature in the present policy of the Government, as\r\nconnected with this people, is to be found in the efforts that are\r\nmaking to remove them beyond the limits of the States and organized\r\nterritories. A very extensive tract of country, lying to the west and\r\nnorth of the Arkansas territory, has lately been set apart for the\r\ncolonization of the Indians.\r\n\r\n“Let such of the emigrating Indians as choose it, continue as heretofore\r\nto devote themselves to the chase in a country where their toils will\r\namply be rewarded. Let those who are willing to cultivate the arts of\r\ncivilisation be formed into a colony, consisting of distinct tribes or\r\ncommunities, but placed contiguous to each other, and connected by\r\ngeneral laws, which shall reach the whole. Let the lands be apportioned\r\namong families and individuals in severalty, to be held by the same\r\ntenures by which we hold ours, with perhaps some temporary and wholesome\r\nrestraints on the power of alienation. Assist them in forming a code of\r\nlaws, adapted to a state of civilisation.\r\n\r\n“In regard to such Indians as shall still remain within the States and\r\nterritories, and refuse to emigrate, let an arrangement be made with the\r\nproper authorities of the States in which they are situated, for\r\npartitioning out to them into severalty as much of their respective\r\nreservations as shall be amply sufficient for agricultural purposes. Set\r\napart a tract proportioned in size to the number of Indians, to remain,\r\nin common, as a refuge, and subject to all the municipal laws of the\r\nstate in which they reside. Let the remainder of the reservation be paid\r\nfor by those who hold the paramount right, at such prices as shall be\r\ndeemed, in reference to the uses which Indians are accustomed to make of\r\nit, reasonable, and the proceeds to be applied for the benefit of those\r\nof the tribe who emigrate after their establishment in the colony; or be\r\ndivided between those who emigrate and those who remain, as justice may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n“To the views herein presented, of the condition of the Indians, of the\r\nprospects which await them, and of the only efficient remedy in their\r\npower to seek, or in that of the government to apply, I take the liberty\r\nof adding my own testimonial, founded on an intimate intercourse with\r\nthem for eighteen years, both personal and official, under every variety\r\nof circumstances, in peace and war, and in very remote regions, as well\r\nas within our own settlements. The principles laid down in these\r\nextracts, are substantially the same as those which now regulate the\r\ngovernment in all their transactions with the Indians, when the question\r\nof their permanent establishment, or removal, is brought under\r\ndiscussion. So far as respects the emigrating Indians, this will clearly\r\nappear by reference to the instructions of the commissioners now engaged\r\nin the adjustment of all the unsettled matters connected with the great\r\nplan of colonization.\r\n\r\n“With regard, however, to those Indians who refuse to remove, it has not\r\nbeen deemed expedient for the government, by its own act, either to\r\npartition out to them the land necessary for their support, or to decide\r\nupon the consideration to be allowed for the residue, and to direct its\r\nappropriation. This, so far as regards the general government, has been,\r\nand continues to be, the subject of conventional arrangement, in which\r\nthe parties, by mutual discussion, and compromise of opinion, arrive at\r\na satisfactory result. In these arrangements, where the parties desire\r\nit, adequate tracts of land, in fee, with temporary and wholesome\r\nrestraints upon the right to sell, are secured to all who desire to\r\nremain. That this system of guardianship is, however, founded upon a\r\njust and intimate knowledge of Indian character, no one acquainted with\r\nthat character will question. I need not now enquire whether a practical\r\nresort to the principles resulting from it will ever become necessary.\r\nIf it should, no doubt every arrangement which justice and humanity call\r\nfor, will be liberally made.\r\n\r\n“In your message to the Senate, of February 22d, 1830, you explained\r\nyour views of the question of jurisdiction over the Indian tribes living\r\nwithin the respective States and territories, and stated, that in your\r\nopinion, and in the words of the above report, they were subject to the\r\nmunicipal laws of the State in which they reside, in all cases where\r\nsuch laws are extended over them.\r\n\r\n“The progress of events, since 1828, has confirmed, if confirmation was\r\nwanting, the correctness of these principles, and their adaptation to\r\nthe actual and prospective condition of the Indians. The circle of\r\ncivilisation and improvement has extended, and various tribes have\r\nretired, or are retiring before it. The experience of the four years\r\nwhich have intervened, does not afford one consolatory hope that the\r\ninsulated bands who have reserved and occupy tracts surrounded by our\r\nsettlements can permanently retain these possessions and prosper. There\r\nare moral, political, and physical causes all in operation, which cannot\r\nbe counteracted, and which forbid such an expectation. And, in fact, the\r\nwhole history of our intercourse with our primitive people teaches no\r\none lesson more important than this; and it will be fortunate for their\r\nposterity, and for our responsibility, if, in its practical application,\r\nboth parties should become satisfied that the system provided by the act\r\nof May 28th, 1830, offers the only rational prospect of a durable and\r\nhappy residence for the Indians. A few individuals, almost always\r\nhalf-breeds, and their connexions, engrossing the intelligence and means\r\nof these small communities, may become assimilated to our institutions,\r\nand eventually planted amongst us with safety. But this should never be\r\npermitted at the sacrifice of more important interests, and to the utter\r\ndisregard of the fate which awaits the unfortunate mass of these tribes,\r\npersuaded or almost compelled to remain where they must rapidly decline,\r\nand at length disappear. And the causes which enacted this law are not\r\nless obvious in their origin, than they are certain in their operation.\r\nTheir progress is onward, and regret them as we may and must, no human\r\npower can arrest their march, or avert their consequences. These efforts\r\nhave been made for generations, and in every mode which wisdom and\r\nphilanthropy could suggest; and yet, in not one solitary instance has it\r\nproduced any permanent or general beneficial effect. And we may survey\r\nour whole cultivated territory in the vain expectation of discovering\r\none aboriginal community, however small, which has withstood the\r\nceaseless pressure of civilisation, and which holds out the slightest\r\nprospect of moral or physical improvement, or even of eventual\r\nsubsistence, for the great body of the individuals composing it. If such\r\na community exists, it is unknown to me; and, in fact, if one is\r\nbelieved to exist, it is only by those who are unacquainted, with its\r\nactual condition, and with the internal history of its wants, its\r\ndissensions, and its oppressions.\r\n\r\n“The Choctaw treaty of 1830, allowed that tribe three years to emigrate.\r\nIn 1831, about 5000 of them removed to their new possessions between the\r\nCanadian and Red rivers. They are highly gratified with the climate and\r\ncountry, and satisfied with the exchange they have made. From the\r\nreturns which have been received, it is estimated that about 7000 more\r\nwill cross the Mississippi this season, and the residue of the tribe,\r\namounting to about 6000, will follow the next.\r\n\r\n“General Coffee has succeeded in concluding a treaty with the\r\nChickasaws, which will lead to their entire removal, and to their\r\nlocation in the west. The basis of this treaty is different from any\r\nheretofore assumed in our negotiations with the Indians. The whole value\r\nof the country ceded is assigned to the Chickasaws, and the United\r\nStates become, in fact, trustees to make the necessary arrangements for\r\ntheir benefit.\r\n\r\n“It is stipulated that the ceded territory shall be surveyed and sold,\r\nand the whole proceeds, deducting only the actual expenses, applied to\r\nthe various objects enumerated, connected with the temporary\r\nsubsistence, removal, and permanent establishment of these Indians. A\r\nresiduary fund is to be invested in some productive stock, and the\r\nincome to be annually appropriated for the public and private objects\r\nstipulated in the treaty. A country for the residence of the tribe is to\r\nbe provided by themselves, and it is probable they will be able to make\r\na satisfactory arrangement for that purpose with the Choctaws, a kindred\r\npeople, who are in possession of a much larger district than is required\r\nby their numbers.\r\n\r\n“No pecuniary benefit will result to the United States from this treaty;\r\nbut should it be ratified, it will constitute an important era in our\r\nIndian relations. It will probably lead to the establishment of the\r\nprinciple that, in future cessions of land, the full value shall be\r\nsecured to the grantors, with such deductions only as may be necessary\r\nto carry into effect the object of the treaties. The advantages to be\r\nderived by the United States from these arrangements will be limited to\r\nthe removal of the Indians from their present unsuitable residences, and\r\nto their establishment in a region where we may hope to see them\r\nprosperous, contented, and improving. And it cannot be doubted but that\r\na course so consistent with the dictates of justice, and so honourable\r\nto the national character, would be approved by public sentiment. Should\r\nwe hereafter discard all expectation of pecuniary advantage in our\r\npurchases from the Indians, and confine ourselves to the great objects\r\nof their removal and reestablishment, and take care that the proceeds of\r\nthe cessions are appropriated and applied to their benefit, and in the\r\nmost salutary manner, we should go far towards discharging the great\r\nmoral debt which has come down to us as an inheritance from the earlier\r\nperiods of our history, and which has been unfortunately increased\r\nduring successive generations by circumstances beyond our control. The\r\npolicy would not be less wise than just. The time has passed away, if it\r\never existed, when a revenue derived from such a source was necessary to\r\nthe government. The remnant of our aboriginal race may well look for the\r\nvalue, and that usefully applied, of the remnant of those immense\r\npossessions which have passed from them to us, and left few substantial\r\nevidences of permanent advantage. One great objection to a removal that\r\nhas been urged by the more discreet Indians, and by many of our own\r\ncitizens, who are honestly seeking their improvement, is the prospect,\r\njudging by the past, that their location west of the Mississippi would\r\nbe temporary, as they would be soon pressed for new cessions, and would\r\nyield, as they have heretofore yielded, to successive applications for\r\nthis purpose. Although the nature and objects of their removal, and the\r\nspirit of the act of Congress which introduced the system, are opposed\r\nto such attempts, still the apprehension is entertained, and has proved\r\ninjurious. Probably no course would better satisfy them upon this\r\nsubject than the introduction of a principle which would secure to them\r\nthe full value of the property, under all circumstances, thus lessening\r\nin their view any wish on our part to acquire it, and ensuring to them,\r\nif not the power and disposition to retain it, at least the means of\r\nconverting it to the greatest advantage.”\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States with regard to the Indians is to place\r\nthem to the west of the Mississippi, and it has been so successful, that\r\na treaty, for the removal of the last body, was concluded at Chicago in\r\nSeptember, 1833, and in 1836 there will scarcely be a resident Indian to\r\nthe east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are a quiet inoffensive race, and generally conduct\r\nthemselves well towards the white people. The united tribes of Sacs and\r\nFoxes, which inhabit the banks of the Mississippi north of Illinois, are\r\nan exception, being a restless fierce people. They made war on the\r\nUnited States in 1831, commencing hostilities in the neighbourhood of\r\nPrairie des Chien. They created a good deal of alarm in the northern\r\npart of Illinois and Michigan, but were easily subdued. Their chief,\r\nBlack Hawk, noticed at page 29, was taken prisoner, and, after two\r\nyears’ confinement, suffered to depart. The Sacs and Foxes have retired\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, and even ceded some territory to the west of the\r\nriver. The chastisement they got, and the increase of population at\r\nGalena, will keep this tribe in subjection in time to come.\r\n\r\nWhat the ultimate effect will be of removing the Indians to the west of\r\nthe Mississippi, I am at a loss to conjecture, and doubt if it will be\r\nso beneficial as the United States’ Government seem to contemplate. Not\r\nbeing fully aware of the causes alluded to in the report of the\r\nsecretary of war, which decrees the poor Indians residing amongst white\r\nmen to certain annihilation, it is unnecessary to speculate on their\r\nremoval, or what effects may come into operation in their new\r\nterritories. I believe, however, it is a fact that the Indians are\r\ndecreasing in number in the Canadas, as well as in the United States,\r\neven after considerable advances in civilisation have taken place, and\r\nChristianity obtained a footing amongst them. It is a common opinion\r\nthat the Indian tribes were extremely numerous in former times, but\r\nthere is no very good evidence of the fact. The French penetrated from\r\nDetroit to New Orleans between 1670 and 1719, establishing trading ports\r\nand villages in many parts of the valley of the Mississippi. At the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century the Sacs and Foxes made a\r\ndesperate effort to take the fort at Detroit from the French, and for\r\nforty years subsequent to that period they caused great trouble and\r\nembarrassment to them, which was terminated by a successful expedition\r\ninto the remote regions west of Green Bay.[9]\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Secretary of War’s Report.\r\n\r\nHad the Indians been very numerous in the valley of the Mississippi when\r\nit was first discovered, they would not likely have established\r\nvillages, more especially when engaged in war with the Sacs and Foxes,\r\nwho reside still in the same regions, and are now, perhaps, more\r\npowerful than at the time alluded to. The progress of the Indians\r\ntowards annihilation does not seem to have been rapid for 160 years, and\r\nit is a melancholy reflection to think it is connected with civilisation\r\nand the intercourse of the whites, and that their removal to the\r\nwilderness and exclusion from white people, has been adopted as the\r\nmeans of preserving the race. Leaving naturalists to determine the\r\nproperties belonging to colour, I shall simply remark, the dark man of\r\nNorth America, like the dark rat of Britain, seems destined to be\r\nexterminated by the light-coloured species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  _Prairie Agriculture—Capital required—Crops and Prices—Wages of Labour\r\n    compared with Land and Produce in Illinois and Britain—Future\r\n    prospects—Sheep Husbandry—Illinois and Upper Canada—Illinois and\r\n    Britain—The Canadas and Illinois estimated by the standard of\r\n    Nature—Emigrant Information._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of forest land in Illinois, is the same as in other\r\nparts of America, but is seldom followed, the cultivation of the prairie\r\nbeing so much more simple and profitable. It has formerly been observed,\r\nthat the grasses have strong creeping roots, and that six oxen are\r\nrequired to plough the land for the first time. The plough which is used\r\nin breaking up the prairie has a very broad share, which cuts a turf\r\nseventeen or eighteen inches wide, by two or three in depth. The thinner\r\nthe turf is cut the less grass is found to grow afterwards, which must\r\nbe owing to the neck, or vital part of the plants, being near the\r\nsurface. After the first ploughing the soil becomes friable, and is\r\neasily cultivated. The breaking up of the prairie is often performed by\r\ncontract at $2 per acre. It is common to drop Indian corn into every\r\nthird furrow of the first ploughing, and the ground is not afterwards\r\noperated upon until the crop is reaped, when it is sown with wheat, and\r\nsimply harrowed. Thus two important crops are obtained by once ploughing\r\nand harrowing. A bushel of Indian corn was stated to be sufficient seed\r\nfor ten acres, and half a bushel of wheat sows one acre. The first crop\r\nof Indian corn commonly yields fifty bushels per acre, and the following\r\nwheat crop twenty-five bushels. When Indian corn is not sown as a first\r\ncrop, the ground is sown with wheat, which is covered by the harrow.\r\nGrass seldom springs after the land has been ploughed, and weeds do not\r\nappear for some years afterwards. When Indian corn is grown on land\r\nwhich has been some time cultivated, it is planted on hills four feet\r\nsquare, the intervals being ploughed in both directions; and a boy with\r\na horse is capable of managing the cleaning process of fifty acres.\r\nThere is but little diversity in prairie agriculture, which is almost\r\nentirely confined to the growing of wheat, oats, and Indian corn.\r\nNatural herbage affords both hay and pasturage, and the supply is at\r\npresent inexhaustible. In the tract which I travelled, the seeds of\r\nclovers, or artificial grass, never had been sown. But there can be no\r\ndoubt of the soil and climate being capable of producing in abundance\r\nalmost every description of plant.\r\n\r\nA great many cattle are reared on the prairies which are occupied in\r\ncommon by the inhabitants. The grass was quite withered when I saw it,\r\nand the cattle were in good condition, although by no means fat. They\r\nare seldom taken under cover during winter, and when snow is on the\r\nground they are foddered with hay. It is customary in some parts to\r\nfatten oxen with Indian corn during winter; and the fine animals seen at\r\nNew York, and alluded to in page 32, had been fed on Indian corn for two\r\nsuccessive winters; it is daily strewed on the ground to the best of the\r\nanimals; a secondary description succeeds to what the first may have\r\nleft, and swine are allowed to pick up the refuse. It is by means of the\r\nIndian corn of the western states that the people of New Orleans, the\r\ncities on the Atlantic, and the Canadas are chiefly supplied with salted\r\nbeef and pork.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no country in the world where a farmer can commence\r\noperations with so small an outlay of money, and so soon obtain a\r\nreturn, as in Illinois. This arises from the cheapness of land, and the\r\nfacility with which it is cultivated, and will appear more evident from\r\nthe following statement:—“Suppose a settler with sufficient capital to\r\npurchase and stock a farm and maintain himself for six months. The farm\r\nto consist of two hundred acres, thirty-five of which being forest and\r\nthe remainder prairie. If the purchase was made in spring, the expense\r\nmight be thus stated:—\r\n\r\n Purchasing 200 acres of land, at $1¼                               $250\r\n Fencing two fields of 40 acres with an eight rail fence,             80\r\n Ploughing by contract 80 acres, at $2                               160\r\n Seed for 80 acres of Indian corn, 10 bushels at 15 cents,          1.50\r\n Cutting and harvesting stalks of Indian corn, and harvesting the\r\n   crop, at $3 per acre,                                             240\r\n Seed for 80 acres of Wheat, sown after Indian corn, 45 bushels\r\n   at 45 cents,                                                    20.25\r\n Harrowing Wheat,                                                     20\r\n Cows 4, at $8, young Cattle 8, at $5, Pigs $10                       82\r\n Buildings and household furniture,                                  600\r\n Maintenance of family for six months, and purchasing seeds of\r\n   vegetables, potatoes, and poultry,                             150.25\r\n                                                                   —————\r\n                                                           Total,  $1604\r\n\r\nWith an expenditure of $1604, or L.340, 17s. sterling, is obtained the\r\ndairy produce of 4 cows and the improvement of 8 cattle grazing on the\r\nprairie, and 3200 bushels of Indian corn, besides vegetables and the\r\nimprovement of a lot of pigs and poultry.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the settler and his family is supposed to be confined\r\nto the cultivation of vegetables, tending the cows and pigs, and\r\nplanting and husking Indian corn.\r\n\r\n In the spring of the second year, 80 acres additional would be\r\n fenced, ploughed, planted with Indian corn, and harvested at\r\n the same expense as the first year                              $481.50\r\n Harvesting 80 acres of wheat at $3                                  240\r\n                                                                  ——————\r\n Total                                                            721.50\r\n\r\nSupposing the Indian corn of the second year equal to the first crop,\r\nthe wheat to yield 22 ½ bushels per acre, and cost 2 ½ bushels in\r\nthrashing—the farmer in eighteen months after settling would have\r\nexpended $2325.50, or L.484, 4s. 6d. sterling. In the same time he would\r\nhave reaped 6,400 bushels of Indian corn, and 1600 bushels of wheat, and\r\nenjoyed abundance of vegetables, dairy produce, beef, pork, and poultry.\r\nWith this produce and expenditure the farmer and his family do not\r\nperform any laborious work. It is presumed the farm would, with some\r\nploughing, to destroy weeds amongst the Indian corn, afterwards continue\r\nto yield yearly 3200 bushels of Indian corn, and 1800 bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe data of the preceding statements are unfavourable for industrious\r\nand frugal emigrants, being framed for a person disliking to work; and\r\nMr Ferguson’s estimate of buildings, and maintaining a family having\r\nbeen taken, which is too high for ordinary settlers. The crops are\r\nestimated considerably lower than what I was told the land of Illinois\r\ngenerally yields; but from knowing how prone farmers are to speak of\r\ngood crops, and conceal indifferent ones, I have made considerable\r\ndeductions from the accounts received, with the view of avoiding\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nIf an industrious man were to purchase the farm, and perform a\r\nconsiderable portion of the work himself, the result would be different.\r\nA saving might also be effected on the buildings and living to the\r\nextent of $250. If to this sum be added $150 for work performed\r\npersonally above the other case, the same produce would be obtained with\r\nan outlay of L.389 sterling. A person who would be content at first with\r\ncheap houses, little household furniture, and labour with his own hands,\r\nmight reap the same produce with an outlay of L.300 sterling. The\r\nexpense of buildings and living until a crop is reaped, must in a great\r\nmeasure depend on the individual himself, and the nature of his family.\r\nBut the advantages of the country will be best seen by simply viewing\r\nthe produce of an acre of land for two years, and the cost of obtaining\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                   Purchasing an acre of land,  $1.25\r\n                   Ploughing,                       2\r\n                   Seed of Indian corn,          0.02\r\n                   Harvesting, &c.                  3\r\n                   Seed for Wheat crop,          0.50\r\n                   Harrowing Wheat,              0.25\r\n                   Harvesting Wheat,                3\r\n                                               ——————\r\n                                        Total, $10.02\r\n\r\nWith an outlay of $10.02, or L.2, 2s. 7d. sterling, there is obtained 40\r\nbushels of Indian corn, and 22½ bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nA person with little capital might commence farming on a smaller scale\r\nthan has been taken for illustration; government selling lots of 80\r\nacres. Supposing a farm of this extent, consisting of fifteen acres of\r\nforest, and the remainder prairie, the expense would stand thus:—\r\n\r\n Purchasing 80 acres, at $1 ¼                                       $100\r\n Fencing into two fields of 30 acres, and one of 5 acres for a\r\n   garden,                                                            80\r\n Ploughing by contract 35 acres, at $2                                70\r\n Seed for 30 acres of Indian corn,                                   .60\r\n Vegetable seeds and potatoes,                                        10\r\n A Cow $8, pigs and poultry $4                                        12\r\n Assistance in harvesting corn,                                       20\r\n Seed for 30 acres of Wheat,                                          15\r\n Harrowing Wheat,                                                   7.50\r\n Buildings and furniture,                                            150\r\n Household expenses,                                                  40\r\n Ploughing 30 acres in spring, at $2                                  60\r\n 2 Oxen for ploughing and harrowing,                                  14\r\n Assistance in harvesting Wheat,                                      30\r\n                                                                    ————\r\n Total,                                                             $609\r\n\r\nWith an expenditure of $609, or about L.130 sterling, and the farmer’s\r\nlabour, 2,400 bushels of Indian corn and 675 bushels of wheat would be\r\nobtained, besides the produce of a cow, vegetables, pigs, and poultry\r\nfor family use.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the enormous quantity of produce exhibited by the\r\npreceding statements, high wages and low prices prevent much money being\r\nrealized. By referring to the statement of the produce of an acre of\r\nland for two years, it will be seen the cost is $10.02, and Indian corn\r\nbeing estimated at 15 cents per bushel, and wheat at 45 cents, the\r\nproduce amounts to $6 and $10.12 ½ for Indian corn and wheat\r\nrespectively; or the outlay is L.2, 2s. 7d., and the produce is L.3,\r\n10s. 7d., subject to the charges of fencing, thrashing, and marketing.\r\nEvery thing, however, has been done by contract, and in future the\r\npurchase of the ground and part of the expense of ploughing would be\r\nsaved. In the view there is a profit on hired labour, and an industrious\r\nman would obtain almost the whole of the produce by labouring himself.\r\n\r\nIn a country where Nature is so bountiful and land so abundant and\r\ncheap, the wages of labour must necessarily be high. Accordingly, an\r\nordinary mechanic obtains $1 per day, with board, including washing; and\r\nsuperior workmen, engineers, and millwrights, get from $2 to $3. Farm\r\nlabourers are engaged at from $100 to $120 a-year. Female house-servants\r\nobtain $1 in private families, and from $2 to $2½ a-week in hotels. As\r\ncompared with the prices of produce and land, wages may be stated thus:—\r\n\r\nIf an ordinary mechanic work five days in the week he will earn\r\nthroughout the year, besides board, $260; or of Indian corn about 1733\r\nbushels; or of wheat about 580 bushels; or of beef about 13,000 lb.; or\r\nof land about 200 acres.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary farm labourer will get during the year, besides his board,\r\n$100; or of Indian corn about 667 bushels; or of wheat about 222\r\nbushels; or of beef about 5000 lb.; or of land about eighty acres; which\r\nis a sufficient extent of surface for any labouring man to possess.\r\n\r\nFemale house-servants in private families get in the year $52, which\r\nwould purchase forty acres of land, and in hotels what would purchase\r\neighty acres of land.\r\n\r\nHow very different is the situation of farm labourers in England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, compared with those in Illinois. Supposing the\r\nweekly wages of labourers to be 10s., 8s., and 3s. 6d., without board,\r\nin England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively, and they do not exceed\r\nthese sums, the Englishman will earn during the year about seventy\r\nbushels of wheat, or of beef about 1560 lbs.—the Scotchman about\r\nsixty-two bushels of wheat, or of beef about 1400 lbs.—the Irishman\r\nabout thirty bushels of wheat, or of beef about 750 lbs. But when the\r\nboard of the workman, or simply what he himself would consume, is taken\r\nfrom these numbers, they will appear quite insignificant compared with\r\nthe wages of Illinois.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary farm labourer in Illinois gets the value of eighty acres of\r\nland yearly: In Britain, when due allowance is made for the board of the\r\nlabourer, he does not get one-tenth of an acre of good land. When wages\r\nare compared with land, the farm labourer of Illinois is about 800 times\r\nbetter rewarded than in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe wages of female servants, compared with the price of land, are also\r\nremarkable. I am sure there are many of my excellent countrywomen who,\r\nif they could reach Illinois, would cheerfully earn a farm for their\r\nfathers, husbands, or lovers, by engaging in service. Perhaps in almost\r\nevery case individuals, on their arrival in the country, would act\r\nprudently by working for hire for the first twelve months, even if they\r\npossess a little capital. By so doing, the knowledge which they would\r\nobtain of the country, and the intercourse of the people, would perhaps\r\nbe of as much importance to them as the increase of funds. In the case\r\nof a family without funds, the members might separate entirely or\r\npartially, as circumstances admitted, and afterwards again unite when\r\nthey had obtained the means of purchasing and farming land.\r\n\r\nThe land in Illinois to which the comparison of wages refers, is of fine\r\nquality, situated in the best climate of America, and, considered as a\r\nworkshop, is not greatly surpassed by any portion of the earth. The view\r\nwhich I have taken of the reward of farm labourers in Illinois and\r\nBritain may appear excessive, yet it will bear investigation. The\r\nBritish labourer’s reward of one-tenth of an acre would yield a mere\r\ntrifle annually; but the Illinois labourer’s reward of eighty acres\r\nmight afford sustenance for himself and family for ever. The man who\r\ngives his services one year for hire in Illinois, and invests his wages\r\nin the purchase of land, obtains the services of nature on a large scale\r\nin perpetuity, and by leading a life of industry and economy for five or\r\nsix years, he would be enabled to purchase and sufficiently stock eighty\r\nacres of land, which would for ever support himself and family.\r\n\r\nIllinois may justly be called “the poor man’s country,” if any part of\r\nthe world deserves the title. The extraordinary reward which the\r\nlabourer receives, and the bountifulness of Nature, are favourable to\r\nthe poor, and no person who has health and strength, and leads an\r\nindustrious and a virtuous life, can continue without the means of\r\nsubsistence in Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe future prospects of Illinois appear to be highly favourable.\r\nReferring to what has been stated regarding the progress of wealth at p.\r\n400, and the channels of trade at p. 424–5, it will be found that almost\r\nall the elements of prosperity exist in the country. The soil,\r\ngrass-covered surface, climate, internal facilities of commerce,\r\ncheapness and extent of land, and the systems of governing and educating\r\nthe people, are not surpassed by any other portion of America, and\r\ninhabitants are alone wanting to complete its greatness.\r\n\r\nThe price of Government land being the same over the United States, the\r\nprairies of Illinois will be preferred by all judicious settlers to the\r\nforests which lie nearer the Atlantic, while the arrangements which have\r\nbeen made with the Indians will tend for a time to check population from\r\nproceeding to the west of the districts already surveyed. The advantages\r\nof the country have only been made public of late years, and less seems\r\nto be known regarding it in the eastern portions of the United States\r\nand the Canadas than in Britain. Emigrants have, however, been streaming\r\nin to Illinois for a year or two from the different parts of Europe and\r\nthe eastern parts of America, and their number is likely to increase. I\r\nhave frequently alluded to the anxiety of people in the eastern States\r\nand the Canadas to sell their lands. This desire proceeds from the\r\nadvantages of a prairie country, in which many of the farmers in other\r\nportions of America obtain better farms than those which they formerly\r\npossessed, and at a twentieth part of the price at which they sell their\r\noriginal ones. There is consequently a class of comparatively wealthy\r\nsettlers attracted to the west, independent of the natural movement of\r\nthe United States people, alluded to at p. 400, 401. But however great\r\nthe influx of population may be, there is sufficient room for all who\r\nare likely to desire a settlement. Illinois being about the size of\r\nEngland, might furnish a greater supply of food, from the general\r\nsuperiority of its soil, and seems to me to be nearly capable of\r\nsustaining the whole inhabitants of England in addition to its present\r\npopulation, or nearly seventy times the inhabitants it now possesses.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the prairies in the western parts of the United States\r\nwill affect the whole population of the Union. The profits of farming in\r\nthe present state of the country regulate the wages of labour generally,\r\nand the facility with which prairie land is cultivated compared to\r\nforest land, will attract the operatives of every profession, and\r\nthereby have a tendency to keep up wages. Although the price of forest\r\nand prairie land is the same, the greater productiveness of the latter,\r\nand small capital required to bring it into a state of cultivation, will\r\nkeep down the price of the necessaries of life by furnishing a greater\r\nsupply. Thus the prairies of the west, by attracting population from the\r\neastern States, will have a tendency to keep up the wages of labour\r\nthere, and prevent a rise in the price of farm produce in the thickly\r\npeopled parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible supply of coal in Illinois is a strong feature in the\r\nfuture greatness of the country, both as enabling the whole surface to\r\nbe devoted to the production of human food, and furnishing fuel for\r\nculinary and manufacturing purposes. From the natural advantages of the\r\ncountry, and consequent great reward of industry, population will be\r\nattracted to it, and manufactures of all kinds will either spring up\r\nwithin the State, or the communication with the cities on the Atlantic\r\nwill become more accessible than it is at present. The towns of\r\nPittsburg and Buffalo seem likely to become the great depots of produce\r\npassing between the eastern and western States. Pittsburg is situated at\r\nthe head of the steam-boat navigation of the river Ohio—it is the chief\r\nseat of hardware manufactures in the United States, and has been termed\r\nthe Birmingham of America. Pittsburg already communicates with the city\r\nof Philadelphia by a railway and canal, and a railway is forming to\r\nconnect it with Baltimore. There is also, I believe, a canal in progress\r\nto open a communication between Pittsburg and the Erie canal,\r\nunconnected with lake Erie. Buffalo is situated at the junction of the\r\nErie canal with lake Erie, and is one of the best commercial situations\r\nin the United States, being connected with the country to the westward\r\nby the great lakes and canals, with New York by the Hudson and Erie\r\ncanal, and it will also soon communicate with Boston by a railway. These\r\ntwo towns are likely to become the centres of diverging lines of\r\nrailroads and other modes of communication between the eastern and\r\nwestern States, which form the only means of preventing the depopulation\r\nof the countries on the Atlantic, as the abundance and cheapness of food\r\nin the west would soon induce manufacturers to emigrate and establish\r\nthemselves there.\r\n\r\nIt may become a question, at no very remote period, whether the\r\ncommunication between the eastern and western States will be cheaper by\r\nwater conveyance or railroads. The waters are shut by frost for a\r\nportion of the year, the navigation of canals is necessarily slow, and\r\nthat of rivers often uncertain from want of water, and at all times\r\nexpensive by the tear and wear of vessels in struggling against the\r\nstream. On the other hand, the level surface is admirably fitted for\r\nrailroads, and the western countries abound in coal and iron. There is\r\nno way of so effectually connecting the east and west as by means of\r\nrailroads. Government commenced a national road, the construction of\r\nwhich has been suspended by President Jackson, to extend from Washington\r\nto Jefferson on the Missouri, a distance of nearly 1000 miles, and\r\nrunning through the prairie country. The funds arising from the sale of\r\nland might easily form a railroad between Jefferson and Pittsburg, which\r\nwould be connected with the seaport towns on the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe value of farm produce and land in the different sections of the\r\ncountry will be affected in opposite ways by the opening of the\r\ncommunication between the east and west. By lessening the expense of\r\ntransport, a greater quantity of produce will flow from the west to the\r\neast, and there will be less difference in price, either by produce\r\nfalling in the east or rising in the west. If prices fall in the east,\r\nthe value of land will fall there; and if prices rise in the west, the\r\nvalue of land will increase there. Facilitating the intercourse between\r\nthe countries will extend the market for western produce, and operate\r\nlike an influx of inhabitants; and the natural effects will be, a rise\r\nin the value of produce and land in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe west will be farther benefited by the opening of communication\r\nlowering the price of the manufactures and luxuries of the east. In a\r\nvery few years, the prices of Illinois and New York will vary only\r\naccording to the expense of transport from one place to the other; and\r\nthe difference will annually decrease with an increase of traffic and a\r\nfacility of communication.\r\n\r\nThe prices of wheat and Indian corn included in the preceding\r\nstatements, represent the general prices in Illinois at the time of my\r\nvisit; and they were then low from the want of commercial population. A\r\nchange in this respect was, however, then taking place, which has since\r\nprogressed. Steam grist-mills have been erected at Jacksonville and\r\nother places, and pork-killers from Cincinnati[10] have established\r\nthemselves at Alton. Commerce has followed agriculture, and the\r\nconsequent competition must have the effect of enhancing the price of\r\nfarm produce. With an unlimited range of pasturage for the rearing of\r\ncattle, and Indian corn at fifteen cents, or seven-pence-halfpenny\r\nSterling per bushel, the farmer might comfortably live by stock, without\r\ncultivating any portion of his land.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  In 1833, 300,000 pigs were killed at Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nSheep husbandry has received considerable attention in some parts of the\r\nUnited States of late years, although it is generally imperfectly\r\nunderstood. The chief object with flockmasters has been to improve the\r\nquality of wool, without regard to the carcass of the animal, wool being\r\nmuch dearer than mutton. Many of the sheep are of the Saxony or Merino\r\nblood, or a mixture of these breeds; and their wool is now selling at\r\ntwo shillings and sixpence sterling per pound. This high price is owing\r\nto sheep husbandry being foreign to the habits and tastes of American\r\nfarmers, and the limited funds and cleared surface possessed by forest\r\nsettlers; and, perhaps, a thorough knowledge of the management of sheep\r\ncan only be acquired from practice. From these causes, the demand for\r\nwool in the United States, with a rapidly increasing population, will,\r\nin all probability, long exceed the supply.\r\n\r\nThere is a general belief in Britain, that the American population\r\ndislike mutton, which is, however, certainly not the case. I saw many a\r\nleg of mutton discussed at table during my tour; and was often assured\r\nthat good hind quarters of mutton sold as high as the best beef. Good\r\nbeef is, however, to be had in almost every village, while good mutton\r\nis a rare commodity, which is partly owing to the breeds of sheep, and\r\ntheir want of food during winter.\r\n\r\nIn a communication addressed to the State Agricultural Society of New\r\nYork, by Henry D. Grove, who resides in Rensseller county, and is a\r\nnative of Germany, Mr Grove has, by his own account, devoted much\r\nattention to wool-growing in Germany, and for five years in the State of\r\nNew York. In both countries his flock consisted of full-blooded Saxon\r\nsheep, and he considers his situation in America, in about forty-two and\r\na half degrees of north latitude, superior to Saxony for growing fine\r\nwool. I have no means of judging between the merits of Saxony and the\r\nState of New York as wool-growing countries; but from what came under my\r\nnotice, I think there is no obstacle to sheep-farming in America but\r\nwhat arises from the severity of the winter, which might be obviated by\r\nproviding shelter and food for the animals.\r\n\r\nMr Grove considers sweet dry pastures, pure water, and pure air, as the\r\nchief essentials of wool-growing; and as these exist in many parts of\r\nIllinois, and may perhaps be made universal by digging wells, there can\r\nbe little doubt of its capabilities for sheep husbandry. Not having seen\r\na sheep while in Illinois, I cannot determine if the prairie grasses are\r\ncalculated to maintain this animal; but as horses and cattle thrive well\r\non them, it is probable sheep will likewise do so. If, however, this\r\nshould be found not to be the case, it would be an easy matter to\r\nconvert the prairie into pasturage, composed of clovers and other\r\ngrasses, by sowing their seeds. The winters in the southern parts of\r\nIllinois are so short, that no great quantity of food would be required\r\nto maintain sheep while the ground was covered with snow; and the\r\nfacility with which Indian corn is raised, would render a supply easily\r\nattained, if the cultivation of turnip was found unsuitable. There can\r\nbe no doubt of potatoes and turnips being easily preserved during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nI have no certain means of ascertaining the duration of an Illinois\r\nwinter in latitude 39. Mr Stuart says he found the cattle in this\r\nmeridian, on reaching the State, fat on the 29th April, but I fear this\r\nis too favourable to the climate. I shall, however, assume the ground to\r\nbe covered with snow for the period of two months, during which it will\r\nbe necessary to feed sheep artificially. Mr Grove, in the communication\r\nformerly alluded to, says, one lb. of oil-cake is equal to two lbs. of\r\ngood hay; and that for twelve or thirteen years he found his “flock did\r\nextremely well whenever he proportioned their food according to\r\nnutritiousness, and in such a manner as that two lbs. of good hay would\r\ngive to each animal.” It may be assumed that Indian corn, which weighs\r\nabout sixty lbs. per bushel, is as nutritious as oil-cake for feeding\r\nsheep. An acre of Indian corn therefore, yielding forty bushels, will\r\nmaintain forty sheep during winter, with the assistance of straw; and if\r\nhay or potatoes were given, a smaller quantity would suffice. If the\r\nIndian corn were bought, and the sheep allowed one lb. daily, each would\r\ncost seven-pence halfpenny sterling for two months keeping.\r\n\r\nMuch of the prairies of Illinois cannot be stocked with sheep until the\r\ndifferent varieties of the wolf are extirpated, which will be easily\r\neffected with an increase of population, and it is only in the\r\nneighbourhood of well-peopled places, and with care during night, that\r\nthey can be safely kept at present. The time will, however, soon arrive\r\nwhen much of the unsold prairies will be covered with sheep, and then\r\nperhaps almost the whole surface of occupied farms will be devoted to\r\nproviding winter-food for the flocks.\r\n\r\nThe value of wool is remarkable, compared with land. Suppose the fleece\r\nof a Merino sheep weighs three lbs., and sells at sixty cents per lb.,\r\nthe wool of one sheep will nearly purchase an acre and a half of land.\r\nWool could be transported from Illinois to the eastern States for three\r\nor four cents a-pound, and there can be no question that it costs less\r\nlabour in producing and carrying to market than any other agricultural\r\ncommodity whatever.\r\n\r\nThe climate and soil of Illinois seem favourable to every description of\r\nagriculture. The luxuriance and productiveness of Indian corn has been\r\nnoticed at page 394. If this crop were succeeded by wheat, accompanied\r\nby clover sown in spring, the herbage of which to be eaten by sheep in\r\nautumn after the wheat is reaped, and ploughed down for manure to Indian\r\ncorn in the following spring, I have no doubt alternate crops of wheat\r\nand Indian corn might be grown without the aid of manures.\r\n\r\nIn whatever point of view Illinois is regarded, as adapted for herds and\r\nflocks, for wheat and India corn, for manufactures and commerce, or for\r\nthe abode of population generally, it will be found to be one of the\r\nmost favoured portions of North America, and with the exception of\r\npopulation, possessing all the elements of future prosperity and\r\ngreatness. Time will supply inhabitants, which the want of at present,\r\nhowever, forms one of the many advantages of the country for\r\nagricultural emigration.\r\n\r\nWhen contrasting Illinois and Upper Canada, I shall not again allude to\r\nthe governments of the countries, or to their channels of trade, but\r\nconfine myself chiefly to their agricultural peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe most northerly portions of Illinois lie in the same latitude with\r\nthe most southerly parts of Upper Canada; and on a general view of the\r\ncountries, the one is four degrees to the north of the other. After\r\nconsidering the different published accounts of an American winter, I\r\nhave been led to conclude, that between thirty-five and fifty degrees of\r\nnorth latitude, the length of winter increases nearly two weeks with\r\neach degree of latitude, consequently the winter of Illinois may be\r\nstated about two months shorter than that of Upper Canada. Then, in\r\npoint of climate, Illinois has greatly the advantage in maturing all the\r\nvaluable products of the soil, and by affording time for cultivating the\r\nfarm properly. Live stock will also suffer much less during winter, and\r\nthe artificial supplies of food necessary for this season, are much\r\neasier attained.\r\n\r\nThe settler of Upper Canada has to struggle with the forest before he\r\nobtains a site for his house. If he ventures to keep a cow, she must\r\nbrowse on weeds and leaves of trees in summer, and in winter on the\r\nboughs of felled trees; the milk and butter which she yields is of the\r\nworst quality, and scarcely repays the trouble of roaming after her in\r\nthe woods. A pig and poultry cannot be maintained at first, and many\r\nyears must pass away before the farm can furnish mutton and wool for\r\nfamily use. Trees must be cut down, chopped into logs, and burned before\r\neven a garden can be formed. The first crops suffer both from the\r\neffects of frost and the want of a circulation of air. The plough cannot\r\nbe profitably used until eight years after the forest is cut down;\r\nduring the greater part of this period the harrow and scythe move\r\namongst blackened stumps, and there is difficulty in growing sufficient\r\nfood for a family.\r\n\r\nThe settler of Illinois places his house on the skirts of the forest or\r\non the open field, as fancy may dictate. The prairie furnishes summer\r\nand winter-food for any number of cattle and sheep, and poultry and pigs\r\nshift for themselves until the crops ripen. With the preliminary of\r\nfencing, the plough enters the virgin soil, which in a few months\r\nafterwards yields a most abundant crop of Indian corn, and on its\r\nremoval every agricultural operation may be executed with facility. The\r\nfirst crops are excellent, and seldom suffer from atmospheric effects.\r\nPastoral, arable, or mixed husbandry, may be at once adopted, and\r\nproduce of all kinds obtained in the utmost profusion.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Canada the settler is immersed in the forest with roads that\r\nare passable for heavy carriages only when frozen. The Illinois settler\r\nenjoys a prospect of wood and plain, and the open prairie affords good\r\nroads at all times when the weather is dry. In Upper Canada no part of\r\nthe surface is productive which has not been cleared. In Illinois the\r\nwhole of a prairie farm is productive without being cultivated. In Upper\r\nCanada the forest settler cannot at first produce his own food, and\r\nlives for a time on flour and salt provisions. In Illinois the settler\r\nat once raises on his farm almost every thing he can consume. In Upper\r\nCanada the farmer is not fully repaid for his first operations until the\r\nend of six or seven years. In Illinois the farmer is repaid for his\r\nfirst operations in course of a few months. The farmer’s reward in Upper\r\nCanada is many years distant, and in Illinois it is almost immediate. In\r\nshort, the farmer in Upper Canada at first finds difficulty in growing a\r\nsufficiency of produce for his own use, and the Illinois farmer\r\ndifficulty in consuming his produce.\r\n\r\nThe positions which I have advanced regarding the farming of the two\r\ncountries, will appear evident from figures. By consulting pages 117 and\r\n375, it will be found that the expense of bringing an acre of wheat to\r\nmaturity in Upper Canada amounts to $.24, exclusive of harvesting,\r\nthrashing, and marketing the crop. The produce cannot be obtained\r\nearlier than eighteen months after entering into possession of the land,\r\nand will not exceed in general cases eighteen bushels per acre. By\r\nreferring to page 448 it will be found, that the expense of raising a\r\ncrop of Indian corn and wheat on the prairies of Illinois is stated at\r\n$4.02, to which $1 must be added for fencing, making $5.02 for both\r\ncrops, exclusive of harvesting, thrashing, and marketing. The crops will\r\nbe obtained in eighteen months after entry, and consist of forty bushels\r\nof Indian corn and 22½ bushels of wheat, or, in other words, the farmer,\r\nwith about one-fifth of the labour or outlay on an acre in Illinois,\r\nwill obtain more than double the produce he could get in the same time\r\nin Upper Canada. But if the calculations were extended to the eighth\r\nyear, the difference of produce would still appear to be greater. During\r\nthis period an acre in Illinois would, with good management, continue to\r\nyield nearly the same produce; while the land in Upper Canada, after\r\nyielding two successive wheat crops, would be allowed to produce grass\r\nuntil the stumps rotted. Grass is of little value in Canada, unless near\r\nvillages where there is a demand for hay, and it would be unfair to\r\nallow any thing for the land remaining in pasturage for five years, as\r\nin this state it would only be on a footing with the uncultivated\r\nprairie. Then, during eight years, an acre of land in Upper Canada would\r\nyield thirty-six bushels of wheat, and in Illinois 160 bushels of Indian\r\ncorn and ninety bushels of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe result of one acre does not fairly exhibit the real advantages of\r\nIllinois. It has formerly been stated that settlers in Canada seldom\r\nclear more than six or seven acres in a year; but to place things in a\r\nfavourable view, I shall suppose ten acres to be cleared, with\r\nassistance in logging and burning. In Illinois an industrious settler\r\nwould have little difficulty, with the occasional assistance of a boy or\r\ntwo, in cultivating fifty acres. On this data, the Upper Canada farmer,\r\nat the end of eighteen months, would raise 180 bushels of wheat, and the\r\nfarmer in Illinois 2000 bushels of Indian corn and 1125 bushels of\r\nwheat. During this period the Upper Canada farmer would neither have\r\ngrass for cow nor sheep, and perhaps scarcely food for a pig; while in\r\nIllinois stock of all kinds may have been kept.\r\n\r\nIn assuming wheat in Upper Canada to yield eighteen bushels per acre\r\nwhen land is first cleared, and wheat in Illinois 22½ bushels, the soil\r\nand climate are supposed to be the same in both countries, and twenty\r\nper cent has been deducted from the wheat of Upper Canada on account of\r\nthe surface occupied by stumps. Should it be contended that my estimate\r\nof the Upper Canada wheat crop is too low, I would argue my estimate of\r\nthe Illinois crop is still more so, and maintain, that whatever produce\r\nthe first wheat crops of Upper Canada may yield, those of Illinois must\r\nbe twenty per cent better, from the ground being free from stumps.\r\nIndian corn cannot be grown on a large scale amongst stumps; and even\r\nafter they are removed, the effect of soil and climate will render the\r\ncrop nearly fifty per cent better in Illinois than in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nMr Ferguson’s calculations seem to me too favourable to Upper Canada;\r\nyet if the expenses of harvesting, thrashing, and teaming be added to\r\nthe expenses of the first wheat crop, as stated by him, the value of the\r\nproduce, which I think he has greatly overrated, falls L.1, 7s. 6d.\r\nshort of the expense it has cost in raising; and no statement which I\r\nreceived made the value of the first crop cover the expense of producing\r\nit. It is this circumstance which renders the farmers of Upper Canada so\r\npoor after first settlement, and time and frugality the only means of\r\nescaping from their wretchedness. It is this circumstance, joined to the\r\neffects of accumulating interest, which renders inevitable the ruin of\r\nevery farmer who purchases on credit, and stamps with folly the recent\r\nproceedings of government in disposing of land. In Illinois the first\r\ncrops more than repay the expense of raising them.\r\n\r\nThe commercial state of the two countries corroborates the nature of the\r\nfarming. A newly settled district in Upper Canada continues to import\r\nflour and salt provisions for many years. In Illinois every farmer, soon\r\nafter establishing himself, sells produce of all descriptions. The whole\r\npopulation of Upper Canada, with exception of those on the rivers\r\nDetroit and Thames, may be said to be fed with fresh or salted animal\r\nfood from the United States. The difficulties of first settlement in a\r\ndensely wooded country are so great that the inhabitants of Upper Canada\r\ncould not have existed without the money of Britain, and the provisions\r\nof the western United States.\r\n\r\nViewing soil as a workshop, the prairie farm of Illinois is superior to\r\nthe forest one in Upper Canada, not only from containing a better supply\r\nof the materials forming climate, as described at pages 327, 328, but\r\nfrom being fitted by nature for immediate operations. Place a prepared\r\nworkshop, and materials for forming another, before any manufacturer\r\nwhatever, and ask him whether he would commence his profession in the\r\nerected shop, or prepare one with his own hands. Such is the situation\r\nof the industrious emigrant farmer with regard to the Illinois prairie\r\nand Upper Canada forest. If choice is made of the latter, the farmer is\r\nlike a manufacturer who would erect a workshop with his own hands. The\r\nforest settler, after suffering privations, undergoing much toil, and\r\npatiently waiting till the stumps decay, will at length find himself in\r\nsomething like the situation of the prairie farmer on his first\r\nsettlement. Nay, the first ploughing of forest land after the stumps\r\nhave decayed, is more expensive than breaking up prairie land, and the\r\nsucceeding crops greatly inferior. I had no opportunity of forming an\r\nopinion of the crops immediately after the stumps decay, but a friend,\r\ncapable of judging, told me a field which I saw preparing under such\r\ncircumstances, on the banks of the Otanabee, in the Newcastle district,\r\nproduced a poor wheat crop in 1834, and that such crops will not average\r\nmore than fifteen bushels per acre. A person in the township of\r\nHinchinbrook, Lower Canada, prepared and sowed a field of stump land\r\nwith wheat in 1834, the crop of which did not cover the expense of\r\nraising and carrying it to market. The capitalist who clears Canadian\r\nforest in preference to farming the prairie of Illinois, makes a\r\nsacrifice of property, and the industrious farmer who follows the same\r\ncourse throws away ten or twelve years of his labour.\r\n\r\nHowever theoretical the view which I have ventured to take of the first\r\nsettlers in the two countries may appear to some minds, it will be found\r\nto accord with practice. Throughout all my peregrinations in Upper\r\nCanada, I did not visit or see a settlement of seven or eight years’\r\nstanding possessing a stack nor a herd of cattle. Ten or twelve acres of\r\nwheat, which was put into a barn, formed the utmost extent of that crop\r\non one farm, and the patches of Indian corn seldom exceeded a rood. The\r\ntables of the farmers were indifferently stored, fried salt pork from\r\nthe United States being served up in many houses twenty-one times\r\na-week. In Illinois the state of things was very different with new\r\nsettlers. Wheat and Indian corn were seen every where in abundance, and\r\nthe tables were amply stored with fresh provisions. In Upper Canada salt\r\npork was the standard dish at all meals, and in Illinois salted meat was\r\nnever placed before me.\r\n\r\nA British farmer can have little idea of the Canadian forest from the\r\ntrees of his own country, which are mere saplings compared with those of\r\nUpper Canada; and his notions of drilled crops and rotations will ill\r\naccord with the disgusting black stumps which disfigure the fields. In\r\nIllinois he may at once pursue any system and perform any operation. The\r\nbest breeds of cattle and sheep will find suitable food in the country,\r\nand the most improved implements of husbandry may be employed. A reaping\r\nmachine was used at Jacksonville in 1834, and it is on the lawned\r\nsurface of the prairie where this and almost every other description of\r\nagricultural machinery can be introduced with advantage. On the forest\r\nfarm of Canada machinery cannot be used, nor stock kept.\r\n\r\nSince the prairies of Illinois possess such advantages over Upper Canada\r\nin the present state of agriculture, what may not be expected from them\r\nwith the progress of science? Already the crops on nearly one hundred\r\nfarms in East Lothian are thrashed by means of steam, and its\r\napplication to other operations will in all probability be soon\r\neffected. The coalfield of Illinois is inexhaustible. With steam power\r\nto cultivate the prairie, and to reap, collect the crops of grass and of\r\nwheat, and to separate the grain from the straw, who can set limits to\r\nthe quantity of human sustenance which Illinois is capable of affording?\r\nIf ever there is such a place as the granary of the world, it will be\r\nthe prairies of the western United States of America.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to form an opinion of the price of wheat in\r\nUpper Canada when I was in the country, the accounts being so\r\ncontradictory, and sometimes stated in cash, and sometimes in store pay.\r\nI have stated the expenses and merchants’ profit of sending wheat from\r\nthe township of Nichol to Britain at 3s. 7d. sterling per bushel, and\r\nperhaps the average expense of the province will exceed 3s. The wheat of\r\nUpper Canada will sell as high in the London market as the best English\r\nwheat. The farmer of Upper Canada must, therefore, sell his wheat about\r\n24s. a-quarter below the highest London prices. The Illinois farmer has\r\ndifferent markets for his wheat, and can send it to Canada if he\r\npleases. I have no means of calculating the expense of transport from\r\nIllinois to Canada, which cannot, however, be very heavy, from the\r\ncanals being public property, and the dues consequently moderate. The\r\ngreater produce of land in Illinois will, however, more than pay the\r\nexpense of sending it to Canada, and I consider myself justified in\r\nsaying that a farm in Illinois will at all times yield more produce than\r\none in Upper Canada, and that produce realize more money.\r\n\r\nThe prices of farm produce being high in Upper Canada is disadvantageous\r\nto the labouring settler who enters on a forest farm, because, being\r\nunable for several years to grow a sufficiency of food for family\r\nconsumpt, the dearness of what he purchases exhausts his funds. So long\r\nas a farmer consumes all the produce which he grows, prices do not in\r\nthe least affect him, and this is too often overlooked in the Canadas,\r\nwhere it is so difficult at first to grow produce. Fresh beef is said\r\noccasionally to fetch twenty-five cents per pound at Quebec, while it\r\ncan be had in some parts of Illinois at three cents. The settler at\r\nQuebec would feel the high price of beef a hardship, and perhaps never\r\nreap the benefit of it from the difficulty of fattening cattle in his\r\nunfavourable situation. The true value of a crop is expressed by the\r\nprice and quantity of produce, diminished by the expense it costs in\r\nraising and marketing.\r\n\r\nI also found difficulty in ascertaining the yearly wages of an\r\nagricultural labourer in Upper Canada, from the system of cash and store\r\npay, and the difference of summer and winter wages. Mr Somerville of\r\nWhitby states the cash wages of the best labourer in Upper Canada at $80\r\na-year, while in Illinois they are $100. Whether these sums are\r\nperfectly accurate, is of no great consequence, as it is universally\r\nadmitted over all Canada that wages are lower there than in the United\r\nStates. Indeed it cannot be otherwise, produce being shared between the\r\nfarmer and labourer, and land in Upper Canada yielding so much less than\r\nin Illinois.\r\n\r\nLabour is more easily obtained in Upper Canada than in Illinois, the\r\ndifficulty with which forest land is cultivated preventing labourers\r\nfarming on their own account. Whether the agricultural capitalist\r\nderives more profit from employing labour in Upper Canada than in\r\nIllinois, I cannot satisfactorily determine; but from what has been\r\nformerly stated, the investment of capital in clearing forest in Upper\r\nCanada does not in the first instance pay, while farming the prairie is\r\nat once remunerating. From the great return of produce, it is probable\r\nboth the capitalist and labourer are better rewarded in Illinois than in\r\nUpper Canada. The higher wages in Illinois, however, bring the farmer\r\nand hired labourer nearer each other in the command of the necessaries\r\nof life than in Canada. But this circumstance ought to form a source of\r\nenjoyment to the capitalist, who should prize the bounty of God the more\r\nfrom knowing it is also amply shared by the labourer. The landholder of\r\nUpper Canada, who sets himself down in the forest, toils hard for the\r\nfirst nine or ten years, and cannot command the same comforts and\r\nnecessaries of life as the labourer in Illinois. I refer to page 450 for\r\nevidence of the truth of this remark.\r\n\r\nAs it is the ambition of every agricultural labourer who leaves Britain\r\nfor America to become a landholder there, I shall endeavour to show what\r\nare the chances of attaining his object in Upper Canada and Illinois.\r\n\r\nSupposing forest land in Upper Canada to be $3 per acre, and a\r\nlabourer’s wages $80 a-year with board, he will get the value of about\r\ntwenty-seven acres of land. In Illinois, land costs $1¼, and wages being\r\n$100, the labourer gets the value of eighty acres. But taking into\r\naccount what has been stated at page 460 regarding the difference of\r\nexpense in raising crops on forest and prairie land, I am justified in\r\nasserting the wages of agricultural labour to be about thirty times\r\nhigher in Illinois than in Upper Canada, when estimated in reference to\r\nland and what it can be made to produce in the respective countries.\r\n\r\nPurchasing extensive tracts of forest land is a hazardous speculation in\r\nUpper Canada, because it is now selling far above its intrinsic value to\r\nactual settlers. The soil continues unproductive while the forest\r\nremains, and it has been already shown that land does not repay the\r\nexpense of clearing for years afterwards. Take for illustration a case\r\nwhere a block of 7000 acres has been purchased at $4 per acre, the block\r\nwould cost L.7000 currency. Suppose the proprietor clears 100 acres\r\nyearly for six successive years, at the termination of which he finds\r\nthe expense of improvement and his family living has been disbursed by\r\nthe crops, and I am much mistaken if such an extent of operations and\r\nsuccessful issue has ever taken place. The legal interest of the country\r\nbeing 6 per cent, the original purchase money will now amount to L.9520,\r\nor a yearly burden on the cleared portion of nearly twenty shillings per\r\nacre; and if the purchase money was only $2 instead of $4, the yearly\r\nburden would still be ten shillings. Purchasing the prairie of Illinois\r\nis very different, because the whole surface is productive without\r\ncultivation, and keeping but a single sheep on it per acre, would leave\r\na profit on the outlay. A rise in the value of Illinois land in course\r\nof a few years may be held to be certain, and in the mean time it will\r\ncontinue productive. A rise in the value of forest land in Upper Canada\r\nfor twenty years to come is doubtful, and until then it will remain\r\nunproductive. There is no way of escaping from loss in holding a tract\r\nof forest land in Canada but by selling it.\r\n\r\nA party of friends cannot conveniently settle themselves together in the\r\nforest of Upper Canada. Each family would be shut out from the others’\r\noccupying a small clearance, with bad roads of communication, and the\r\nlarger the party and the extent of each family’s possessions, the\r\ngreater these and other inconveniences would become. A party may occupy\r\na portion, or the whole, of a prairie in Illinois with the best effects.\r\nEach family might settle within sight of the whole party, with good\r\nroads of communication, and although the possessions of each might be\r\nextensive, circumstances would be the same, with exception of the\r\ndistance of separation. The skirts of the prairie would afford forest,\r\nscattered trees, or lawn for adorning residences, but Upper Canada being\r\nan interminable forest, the members of which do not answer to stand when\r\nsingled out, there is but little choice of natural beauty of situation.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists of Britain, who have long been accustomed to obtain\r\nhigh prices for produce, and consequently to finger much cash, may be\r\napt to treat with contempt the idea of farming in a country where prices\r\nare so low as they are in Illinois. I have already remarked that the\r\nBritish farmer collects the corn-law tax, the results of nature’s\r\nassistance, and part of what flows from his own capital, and the\r\noperatives’ labour, all of which he pays in the name of rent and taxes;\r\nso it is only that portion of the cash which sticks to his own pocket\r\nthat is really valuable to him. When conversing on this subject, a\r\nfarmer once remarked to me that he paid money away as fast as it was\r\nreceived, and derived no advantage from the cash which resulted from\r\nhigh prices beyond the temporary pleasure of looking at it.\r\n\r\nIt is far from my intention to undervalue the advantages enjoyed by the\r\nfarmers of Britain, or to ridicule them for discharging, through the\r\nmedium of high prices, just debts, which I consider to be one of the\r\nmost pleasing employments in life. But while sensible of the general\r\nbenefits of cash, let me ask British farmers what is the use of money to\r\nthem beyond the means it affords of purchasing things? The industrious\r\nfarmer of Illinois may not perhaps be able to accumulate much money, but\r\nalthough not rich in _cash_, he cannot fail of being rich in _things_.\r\n\r\nThe view which I have ventured to describe of cash and things, as\r\naffecting the farmer of Britain and Illinois, is not visionary. Take for\r\nillustration a favourable case in Britain. Suppose a farmer to have\r\nrented 300 acres for a period of thirty years, during which he has\r\nmaintained and educated a family, and to die worth five thousand pounds.\r\nThis sum will do little more than place two sons in a situation similar\r\nto what he occupied, that is to say, it will purchase twice the farming\r\napparatus he himself possessed. A farmer occupying the like extent and\r\nfor the same period in Illinois, might educate and maintain a family in\r\nthe fullest abundance, and would find no difficulty during his lifetime\r\nin placing a dozen of sons in a similar position with himself by the\r\nmeans of things, whatever might be the state of prices. If a son, on\r\nattaining his fifteenth year, were to work for hire, or to be\r\nindustrious on his father’s farm until reaching the age of twenty-one,\r\nthe results of his own labour would enable him to purchase and stock a\r\nfarm without assistance from the father. But in a case where the son may\r\nnot have been industrious, the farmer could have little difficulty in\r\nproviding him with a farm, when the fleece of a sheep purchases an acre\r\nand a half of land. A farm is almost as easily stocked as it is\r\npurchased, one ploughing and harrowing being sufficient to procure a\r\ncrop of Indian corn and one of wheat; while the produce of an acre of\r\nthe former will furnish seed for 320 acres, and an acre of the latter\r\nseed for forty-five acres.\r\n\r\nHitherto the case of farmers and their sons has only been alluded to. It\r\nis unnecessary, however, to notice the situations of widows, daughters,\r\nand infant-children, after what has been stated at pages 336–7 and\r\n344–5. When a British tenant, who has farmed on lease, is descending the\r\nvale of years, with local attachments for the spot where he was born\r\ndeeply-seated in his heart, the caprice of landholder, agent, or factor\r\nmay uproot the best feelings of his nature, and set him aside to make\r\nroom for another. But the farmer of Illinois has the assurance of\r\nterminating his days on the spot which has been the scene of his\r\noperations in manhood, unmolested by any one.\r\n\r\nThe farmer may change the scene of his operations from Britain to\r\nIllinois, and benefit by the transition, but the like prospect cannot be\r\nheld out to the Illinois farmer. The following is an extract from a\r\nletter lately received from my brother Charles:—“I do not regret the\r\nstep which I have taken in settling myself on the banks of the\r\nMississippi, and shall be stimulated to active exertion by the thought,\r\nthat every tree I cut down, every sod I turn, and every animal I rear,\r\nbrings me nearer Scotland. I have reason to believe these hopes will be\r\nrealized. Allowing, however, that they will not—that a livelihood is the\r\nmost I shall obtain, and that I am compelled to spend and end my days\r\nhere—what of that? at the longest, life is not so very long, and when\r\naccompanied with virtue, it has attractions almost any where. But I\r\nstill look to Scotland as containing all I truly love in this world, and\r\nshall never relinquish the hope of being able to end my days at home.”\r\nIn Britain the state of every thing at present is so different from\r\nIllinois, that there is not much prospect of any emigrant farmer\r\nrealizing such a fortune in Illinois as will enable him to return and\r\nlive in Britain. The rate of interest in Illinois being nearly three\r\ntimes more, and the price of provisions nearly three times less than in\r\nBritain, a change of residence from the former to the latter would be\r\nattended with an immense loss of income to the capitalist. On the other\r\nhand, a change from Britain to Illinois would greatly augment his\r\nincome. Britain and Illinois cannot, however, long continue so\r\ndissimilar as they are at present. The necessaries of life are likely to\r\napproach nearer each other in price, by a rise in the one country and a\r\nfall in the other, and ultimately the youthful emigrant of the present\r\nday may be enabled to return to Britain in his old age.\r\n\r\nSome of the opinions which I have expressed of the Canadas and Illinois,\r\nas adapted for agriculture, may be tested by the standard of nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the junction of the north branch of the river Ottawa with the St\r\nLawrence below Montreal, to Goderich in the west of Upper Canada, and\r\nfrom thence to the southern point of Illinois, the eye is only relieved\r\nby two inconsiderable eminences in Lower Canada. Lakes Huron and\r\nMichigan being situated in the highest parts, and only 589 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, this tract of country may be considered an immense\r\nvalley, the Canadas running from the lakes in a north-easterly\r\ndirection, and Illinois running south. On a general view, there is so\r\nlittle difference of elevation, that the countries may be considered of\r\nthe same altitude, and their climates affected only by latitude. The\r\nmedium latitude of Lower Canada may be stated at 46°, of Upper Canada,\r\n44°, and of Illinois, 40. Supposing winter to increase in duration two\r\nweeks with each degree of latitude, the winter of the medium of Illinois\r\nmay be stated at two months, of Upper Canada at four months, and of\r\nLower Canada at five months. The summers of the countries lengthen\r\ninversely with the winters.\r\n\r\nJudging from what came under my notice, I am inclined to think the\r\nsurface of Illinois is superior soil to the Canadas, and the lower\r\nprovince better than Upper Canada. There is, however, much good and bad\r\nsoil in all the countries, and in order to avoid the semblance of\r\npartiality, the soil of the Canadas and Illinois shall be assumed to be\r\nsimilar in quality.\r\n\r\nI have formerly denominated soil a workshop; air, moisture, light, and\r\nheat, raw materials, termed climate; plants and animals, machinery;\r\ncertain minerals and labour, oil for the machinery which manufacture\r\nfarm produce. Nature and man perform distinct parts in the manufacture,\r\nand the farmer’s success depends on the aid which he is enabled to\r\nafford her. Man is subordinate to nature, and a superabundant or a\r\ndiminished supply of moisture or of heat, which form part of the\r\nmaterials she supplies, may arrest the manufacture, and impair or\r\ndestroy the machinery furnished by man.\r\n\r\nThe workshop or soil of the Canadas and Illinois has been assumed to be\r\nsimilar, but the raw materials of nature are not at all times furnished\r\nto the workshops of these countries in the same proportions, and this\r\nvariation of supply or difference of climate, affects the manufacturing\r\nresults of the farms, both with regard to the quantity and quality of\r\nfabrics.\r\n\r\nThe winters of Lower Canada, Upper Canada, and Illinois being\r\nrespectively five, four, and two months in length, manufacturing will be\r\naltogether suspended in the countries for corresponding periods. The\r\neffects of suspended heat, or presence of cold, on animal machinery, is\r\nincreased by intensity as well as duration, and labour or furnishing of\r\noil is impracticable in winter. Manufacturing proceeds only when winter\r\nis absent, and is increased by the intensity and length of summer, when\r\noil can be supplied. Winter being absent seven months in Lower Canada,\r\neight in Upper Canada, and ten in Illinois, the relative quantities of\r\nfabrics manufactured in the workshops are not truly represented by these\r\nnumbers; and when all the effects of climate and of labour on animal and\r\nvegetable machinery are duly considered, the average farming results, as\r\nregard quantity, may be stated in Lower Canada at six, in Upper Canada\r\nat seven and a half, and in Illinois at ten. But farming depends greatly\r\non the aid afforded nature, and the stated results of the countries are\r\nsupposed to arise from similar management.\r\n\r\nClimate not being alike congenial to all plants and animals, the results\r\nof the farm will be affected in quantity and quality by the machinery\r\nwhich is employed and the care bestowed on it. It is almost unnecessary\r\nto illustrate this position. The north of Scotland yields finer oats\r\nthan the south of England, but falls far short in the growth of wheat.\r\nThe wheat of Lower Canada is inferior to the wheat of the upper\r\nprovince, and the growth of Illinois is superior to the wheat of Upper\r\nCanada. Lower Canada does not produce autumn sown wheat, and Upper\r\nCanada is not, like Illinois, congenial to the growth of Indian corn,\r\nthe “meal, meadow, and manure” of the farm. Taking into consideration\r\nthe winters and summers of the countries, the qualities of their wheat,\r\nand the importance of Indian corn, the average farming results,\r\ncombining the quantity and quality of human sustenance, may be stated in\r\nLower Canada at five, in Upper Canada at eight, and in Illinois at\r\ntwelve. This calculation is meant to apply to soil under cultivation,\r\nand to embrace the results of nature, capital, and labour.\r\n\r\nI formerly assumed the results of nature in American farming to be\r\nrepresented by the number 3. They will, however, necessarily vary with\r\nthe climate of the different parts of the country and the system of\r\nmanagement pursued. From what has been already stated regarding the\r\nagriculture of the Canadas and Illinois, nature’s part in the produce\r\narising from cultivation may be stated thus—\r\n\r\n        Nature in Lower Canada produce will be represented by 2\r\n          ——   in Upper Canada by                             3\r\n          ——   in Illinois by                                 4\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned, that a person possessing his own land has\r\nnature for his servant; and if the estimates of her assistance in the\r\ndifferent countries approximate to accuracy, the farmer in Illinois\r\nreceives from nature double the assistance of the Lower Canada farmer,\r\nand upwards of thirty per cent more than the farmer in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThe assistance which farmers in the different countries derive from\r\nnature on first settlement is not fully displayed by the numbers two,\r\nthree, and four. It has formerly been assumed that a person in the\r\nCanadas may clear ten acres of forest land in a year, and reap from it a\r\ncrop of wheat at the end of eighteen months, and that a person in\r\nIllinois may reap in the same time a crop of Indian corn and a crop of\r\nwheat from fifty acres. But the stumps of trees in the Canadas will\r\noccupy two acres out of the ten, and thereby limit nature’s assistance\r\nto eight acres. Nature’s assistance to the farmer in eighteen months\r\nafter settlement may be thus expressed:—\r\n\r\n    In Lower Canada, 8 multiplied by 2 on a wheat crop,          16\r\n    In Upper Canada, 8 multiplied by 3 on a wheat crop,          24\r\n    In Illinois, 50 multiplied by 4 on an Indian corn crop, 200 400\r\n    In Illinois, 50 multiplied by 4 on a wheat crop,        200  „\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding statement, the farmer in Illinois receives from\r\nnature twenty-five times the assistance of the Lower Canada farmer, and\r\nnearly seventeen times the assistance of the farmer in Upper Canada. But\r\nif nature’s contribution to the advantages which the Illinois settler\r\nderives from the prairie be estimated, he may be said to receive from\r\nnature thirty, and twenty times the assistance of the farmer in Lower\r\nand Upper Canada respectively. It is the assistance which the farmer\r\nderives from nature in degree, as well as in extent, which gives the\r\nprairies of Illinois such advantages over the forests of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe British emigrant reaches Lower Canada by the river St Lawrence, the\r\nnavigation of which is closed by ice from November till May. Upper\r\nCanada may be reached by the St Lawrence, or by way of New York and the\r\nErie canal. When the emigrant has a delicate family, and is encumbered\r\nwith heavy luggage, the route by New York is the best, more especially\r\nif the place of his destination communicates with lakes Erie, St Clair,\r\nor Huron. The routes to Illinois are by the St Lawrence and New York,\r\nthrough the western lakes to Chicago on lake Michigan, or by New York\r\nand the canal communicating with the river Ohio and lake Erie. Illinois\r\nmay also be reached by way of New York, Philadelphia, and from thence to\r\nWheeling on the Ohio, or by way of Baltimore and Wheeling. But the most\r\neconomical way for a family and luggage to proceed is by way of New\r\nOrleans and the Mississippi, navigation seldom being interrupted by this\r\nroute, and steam-boats leaving New Orleans every two or three days for\r\nthe town of St Louis and the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the best cabin passage from Liverpool to New Orleans,\r\nincluding bedding and wine, is from L.30 to L.35 sterling, and the\r\npassage from New Orleans to St Louis, L.5, 6s. A steerage passage from\r\nLiverpool to New Orleans is from L.4 to L.5, exclusive of bedding and\r\nprovisions, and from New Orleans to St Louis, L.1, 14s.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural implements of Britain are ill adapted for the forest\r\nsettler; and as a general rule, the implements of the country are\r\nsuitable for what is required of them. Cotton goods are nearly as cheap\r\nin the United States as in Britain, but woollens are higher.\r\n\r\nThe household furniture of Britain is unsuitable for agricultural\r\nemigrants. Cooking apparatus adapted for the country can be had every\r\nwhere. Crockery, glass, and hardware may be taken, and bedding\r\nmaterials, with exception of feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n   EDINBURGH: PRINTED BY BALLANTYNE AND CO., PAUL’S WORK, CANONGATE.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n Page           Changed from                      Changed to\r\n\r\n   41 with dark faces.
