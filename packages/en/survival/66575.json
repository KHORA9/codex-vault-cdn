PRICE 1½_d._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A VAST EXPLOSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest physical convulsion of recent times occurred on the\r\nmorning of the 27th of August last year, the scene of the catastrophe\r\nbeing a small island in the Sunda Straits, which separate Sumatra and\r\nJava. It is a region which there is much reason to regard as one of the\r\nintensest foci of volcanic activity on the earth’s surface. The main\r\nfacts connected with this event, although slow in coming to hand, are\r\nnow fairly within the records of science. Krakatoa, the volcanic island\r\nwhich a year or two ago was seven miles long by five broad, is about\r\nthirty miles from the Java coast. When surveyed in 1868-69, the island\r\nwas found to be clothed from base to summit with a luxuriant growth of\r\nforest and tropical vegetation, but uninhabited. A few weeks prior to\r\nthe eruption, the volcano, which had been dormant for two centuries,\r\ngave signs of an awakening. On the 20th of May several shocks,\r\naccompanied by loud explosions and hollow reverberations, startled the\r\ninhabitants of the towns of Batavia and Buitenzorg, about ninety miles\r\ndistant.[1] These disturbances continued for the next three months with\r\nmore or less activity. On the 11th and 18th of August the energy of the\r\nvolcano increased, and there were symptoms of a crisis. On the 26th and\r\nthe night following, several eruptions took place, until the climax was\r\nreached on the following morning. The submarine base of the mountain\r\nthen seems, according to all available evidence, to have literally\r\n‘caved in.’ This was apparently accompanied by an influx of the sea\r\ninto the molten interior, the instantaneous development of superheated\r\nsteam, and then an explosion which, for its colossal energy, is\r\nunparalleled in the annals of volcanic outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe enormous power of this eruption can only be adequately understood\r\nby its effects; these we now briefly summarise. The explosion itself,\r\naccording to Dr Verbeek, one of the Dutch Commission appointed to\r\ninvestigate the nature and results of this catastrophe, caused the\r\nnorth part of the island to be blown away, and to fall eight miles to\r\nthe north, forming what is now named Steer’s Island. Moreover, the\r\nnorth-east portion of the island of Krakatoa was also hurled into the\r\nair, passed over Lang Island, and fell at a distance of seven miles,\r\nforming what is now known as Calmeyer Island. In proof of this, we have\r\nthe fact elicited by the newly made marine survey of the Straits, that\r\n‘_the bottom surrounding these new islands has not risen_.’ This would\r\nhave been the case had they been upheaved in the usual way. Not only\r\nso, but the bottom round these new islands shows a slightly _increased\r\ndepth_ in the direction of the submarine pit, nearly one thousand feet\r\ndeep, which now marks the place the peak of Krakatoa occupied prior\r\nto the convulsion. But out of the midst of this deep depression there\r\nrises ‘like a gigantic club’ a remarkable column of rock of an area\r\nnot more than thirty-three square feet, which projects sixteen feet\r\nabove the surface of the sea. The southern part is all that is now left\r\nof the island of Krakatoa, and this fragment on its north side is now\r\nbounded by a magnificent precipitous cliff more than two thousand five\r\nhundred feet high. It has been thought by some, however, that the first\r\nportion of the island was blown away on the evening of August 26th, and\r\nthat on the following morning the larger mass, answering to Calmeyer\r\nIsland, was shot out by an effort still more titanic.\r\n\r\nThe shock of the explosion was felt at a distance of four thousand\r\nmiles, being equal to an area of one-sixth of the earth’s surface—that\r\nis, at Burmah, Ceylon and the Andaman Islands to the north-west, in\r\nsome parts of India, at Saigon and Manila to the north, at Dorey in\r\nthe Geelvink Bay (New Guinea) to the east, and throughout Northern\r\nAustralia to the south-west. Lloyd’s agents at Batavia, in Java, stated\r\nthat on the eve of this vast explosion, the detonations ‘grew louder,\r\ntill in the early morning the reports and concussions were simply\r\ndeafening, not to say alarming.’ So violent were the air-waves, due to\r\nthis cause, that walls were rent by them at a distance of five hundred\r\nmiles, and so great the volume of smoke and ashes, that Batavia, eighty\r\nmiles off, was shrouded in complete darkness for two hours. Nearly four\r\nmonths after the eruption, masses of floating pumice, each several\r\nacres in extent, were seen in the Straits of Sunda.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it appears, the sound was sometimes better heard in\r\ndistant places than in those nearer the seat of disturbance. This\r\nsingular effect has been thus explained—assuming, for example, the\r\npresence of a thick cloud of ashes between Krakatoa and Anjer, this\r\nwould act on the sound-waves like a thick soft cushion; along and above\r\nsuch an ash-cloud the sound would be very easily propelled to more\r\nremote places, for instance, Batavia; whereas at Anjer, close behind\r\nthe ash-cloud, no sounds, or only faint ones, would be heard. Other\r\nexplanations seem to be less probable, though not impossible.\r\n\r\nDr Verbeek states that within a circle of nine and a-half miles’\r\nradius (fifteen kilomètres) from the mountain, the layers of volcanic\r\nash cover the ground to a depth of from sixty-five to one hundred\r\nand thirty feet, and at the back of the island the thickness of the\r\nash-mountains is in some places even from one hundred and ninety-five\r\nto two hundred and sixty feet, and that the matter so projected\r\nextends over a known area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square\r\nkilomètres (285,170 square miles), or a space larger than the German\r\nEmpire with the Netherlands and Belgium, including Denmark and Iceland,\r\nor nearly twenty-one times the size of the Netherlands. Moreover, he\r\ncalculates that the quantity of solid substance ejected by the volcano\r\nwas eighteen cubic kilomètres, or 4.14 _cubic miles_. To give some\r\nidea of the enormous volume this represents, we may take the following\r\nillustration: the largest of the Egyptian pyramids has upwards of\r\neighty-two millions of cubic feet of masonry; it would therefore take\r\nabout _seven thousand three hundred and sixty of such structures_ to\r\nequal the bulk of matter thrown out by this eruption. Some of this\r\nmatter was found to contain smooth round balls from five-eighths to two\r\nand a-quarter inches in diameter, and composed of fifty-five per cent.\r\nof carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nAs may well be imagined, the final outburst by its awful energy gave\r\nrise to a succession of air-waves. These we now know went round the\r\nearth more than once, and recorded themselves on the registering\r\nbarometers or barograms at the Mauritius, Berlin, Rome, St Petersburg,\r\nValencia, Coimbra (Portugal), and other far-distant places. At\r\nsome points, as many as seven such disturbances were noted; other\r\ninstruments not so sensitive gave evidence of five, by which time the\r\nwave had pretty well spent itself.\r\n\r\nHaving collected the observations made at all the chief meteorological\r\nstations, General Strachey recently read a paper before the Royal\r\nSociety which, in his opinion, conclusively shows that an immense\r\nair-wave started from Krakatoa at about thirty minutes past nine A.M.\r\non August 27th. Spreading from this common centre, the wave went three\r\nand a-quarter times round the globe, and those parts of it which had\r\ntravelled in opposite directions passed through one another ‘somewhere\r\nin the antipodes of Java.’ The velocity of the aërial undulations\r\nwhich travelled from east to west was calculated at six hundred and\r\nseventy-four miles per hour, those moving in the reverse direction at\r\nseven hundred and six miles per hour, or nearly the velocity of sound.\r\n\r\nBut another effect of the eruption was a series of ‘tidal waves,’\r\nso called—although the term is objected to because not strictly\r\nscientific—which, like the air-wave, passed round the world. Whether\r\nthis was synchronous with the final explosion, it is not possible to\r\nsay. The highest of these seismic sea-waves, which was over one hundred\r\nfeet high, swept the shores on either side of the Straits, and wrought\r\nterrible destruction to life and property. More than thirty-five\r\nthousand persons perished through it; the greater part of the district\r\nof North Bantam was destroyed, the towns of Anjer, Merak, Tjeringin,\r\nand others being overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe initial movement of this destructive agent was undoubtedly of the\r\nnature of a negative wave; but the best testimony to this is lost,\r\nsince those who witnessed it were its victims. The sudden subsidence\r\nof so large an area of the sea-bottom in the Straits caused the sea to\r\nrecede from the neighbouring shores. This negative wave was, however,\r\nseen by Captain Ferrat from his vessel, as she lay at anchor at Port\r\nLouis. He states that towards two P.M. he saw the water in the harbour\r\nroll back and suddenly fall four or five feet; and that, a quarter of\r\nan hour afterwards, the sea returned with great violence to its former\r\nlevel, causing his own and other vessels to roll terribly. The best\r\nwitness of this remarkable phenomenon, however, is Captain Watson, of\r\nthe British ship _Charles Ball_. His vessel was actually within the\r\nStraits, and he states that he and his helmsman ‘saw a wave rush right\r\non to Button Island, apparently sweeping right over the south part, and\r\nrising half-way up to the north and east sides fifty or sixty feet,\r\nand then continuing on to the Java shore. This was evidently a wave of\r\ntranslation and not of progression, for it was not felt at the ship.’\r\nThis latter movement, beyond question, must have coincided with the\r\ngreat ‘tidal wave’ above mentioned, and which was felt at Aden, on the\r\nCeylon coast, Port Blair, Nagapatam, Port Elizabeth, Kurrachee, Bombay,\r\nand half-way up to Calcutta on the Hooghly, the north-west coast of\r\nAustralia, Honolulu, Kadiall in Alaska, San Celeto near San Francisco,\r\nand the east coast of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn this as in most other cases of volcanic disturbance, electrical\r\nphenomena were observed. One vessel in particular, while passing\r\nthrough the Sunda Straits, exhibited ‘balls of fire’ at her masthead\r\nand at the extremities of her yardarms. Further, it was noticed at\r\nthe Oriental Telephone Station, Singapore, a place five hundred miles\r\nfrom Krakatoa, that on raising the receiving instrument to the ears, a\r\nperfect roar as of a waterfall was heard; and by shouting at the top\r\nof one’s voice, the clerk at the other end of the wire was able just\r\nto hear something like articulation, but not a single sentence could\r\nbe understood. On the line to Ishore, which includes a submarine cable\r\nabout a mile long, reports like pistol-shots were heard. These noises\r\nwere considered due to a disturbance of the earth’s magnetic field,\r\ncaused by the explosion, and reacting on the wires of the telephone.\r\n\r\nWe have now to refer to what has been a much debated question. From\r\nabout September to the beginning of the present year, remarkable\r\ncoronal appearances and sunglows were noticed in different parts of\r\nthe world, and especially the somewhat rare phenomena of red, green,\r\nand blue suns. Observers such as Norman Lockyer, Dr Meldrum, and\r\nHelmholtz maintained that the phenomena were due to volcanic dust at\r\na great altitude; others, and notably meteorologists, rejected this\r\nhypothesis, and urged that the coloured suns were due to unusually\r\nfavourable atmospheric conditions, such colours being probably due\r\nto the refraction and reflection of light by watery vapours. But the\r\ntheory that volcanic dust caused these appearances is fast gaining\r\nground, if it be not already an incontrovertible fact. The spectroscope\r\nhas shown that dust of almost microscopic fineness floating in the air\r\ncaused the sun to appear red. Such dust has already fallen, and the\r\nmicroscope reveals the existence in it of salt particles. This, then,\r\nis fairly conclusive evidence of the volcanic origin of such dust. That\r\nash particles were actually carried very far in the upper air-currents,\r\nhas already appeared from snow which fell in Spain and rain in Holland,\r\nin which the _same components_ were found as in the Krakatoa ashes.\r\nDr Verbeek estimates that the height to which this fine matter was\r\nprojected ‘may very well have reached’ forty-five to sixty thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to the _Midland Naturalist_ by Mr Clement Wragge,\r\nof Torrens Observatory, Adelaide, South Australia, and dated July 17,\r\n1884, the writer remarks that recently, when there were magnificent\r\nsunsets, he obtained ‘a perfectly sharp, clean spectrum without a trace\r\nof vapour-bands.’ And further, he is strongly of opinion that the\r\nKrakatoa eruption is the primary cause of these wondrous pictures in\r\nthe Kosmos.\r\n\r\nThere can now be little doubt but that the green and blue suns and\r\nexceptional sunsets observed in Europe, India, Africa, North and South\r\nAmerica, Japan, and Australia, were due to the Krakatoa eruption. The\r\nenormous volume of volcanic dust and steam shot up into the higher\r\natmospheric zones by this convulsion are adequate to furnish the\r\nchromatic effects above mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut we have better evidence still: these peculiar solar effects\r\nfollowed a tolerably straight course to one which was in fact chiefly\r\nconfined to a narrow belt near the equator; the data now collected show\r\nthat on the second day after the eruption they appeared on the east\r\ncoast of Africa, on the third day on the Gold Coast, at Trinidad on the\r\nsixth, and at Honolulu the ninth day. Finally, in a paper read by Dr\r\nDouglas Archibald at the late British Association meeting at Montreal,\r\nit was stated that ‘observations showed that the dates of the sunglows\r\nbegan _earlier_ in Java, then apparently spread gradually away, the\r\ndust being so high as to be in the upper currents, of which we know\r\nlittle. These sunset glows were not seen before the eruption.... The\r\ndust appeared to have travelled at a uniform rate, over two thousand\r\nmiles daily.’ ‘The topic,’ says Mr S. E. Bishop, writing from\r\nHonolulu, ‘is an endless one. Many ask what is the cause of frequent\r\nrevivals of the red glows, such as the very fine one of August 19. It\r\nseems merely to show an irregular distribution of the vast clouds of\r\nthin Krakatoa haze still lingering in the upper atmosphere. They drift\r\nabout, giving us sometimes more, sometimes less, of their presence.\r\nIt is also not unlikely that in varying hygrometric conditions the\r\nminute dust-particles become nuclei for ice crystals of varying size.\r\nThis would greatly vary their reflecting power, and accords with some\r\nobservations of Mr C. J. Lyons, showing that the amount of red glow\r\nvaries according to the prevalence of certain winds.’ Further facts are\r\ncoming to hand respecting this great natural convulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The eruption of May was noticed in a previous article (Nov. 24,\r\n1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY MEAD AND STREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.—SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITY.\r\n\r\nSoon after reading Mr Shield’s letter, Madge walked to Ringsford with\r\nPansy. There had been a thaw during the night, and the meadows and the\r\nploughed lands were transformed into sheets of dirty gray, dirty blue,\r\nand reddish slush, according to the character of the soil, dotted with\r\npatches of snow like the ghosts of islets in a lake of puddle. But the\r\nred sun had a frosty veil on his face; by-and-by this puddle would be\r\nglazed with ice, and the heavy drops of melting snow which were falling\r\nslowly from the trees would become glittering crystal pendants to their\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nThe two girls, their cheeks tingling with the bite of the east\r\nwind, tramped bravely through the slush, with no greater sense of\r\ninconvenience than was caused by the fact that they would be obliged to\r\nperform the journey by the road instead of taking the short-cut through\r\nthe Forest.\r\n\r\nThey spoke little, for each was occupied with her own troublous\r\nthoughts; Pansy did not know much of the sources of her friend’s\r\nanxieties, and Madge had already exhausted the consolation she could\r\noffer to her companion. On arriving at Ringsford they found Sam Culver\r\nattending to his plants and greenhouses as methodically as if the\r\nmansion stood as sound as ever it had done and the daily supply of\r\nfruit and flowers would be required as usual.\r\n\r\nMadge left Pansy with her father, and went on to the cottage. In the\r\nkitchen she found Miss Hadleigh fast asleep in the gardener’s big\r\narmchair. She would have left the room without disturbing her, but at\r\nthat moment Miss Hadleigh yawned and awakened.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t go away; I am not sleeping.—Oh, it’s you, Madge. Isn’t this a\r\ndreadful state of things? I haven’t had a wink of sleep for two nights,\r\nand feel as if I should drop on the floor in hysterics or go off into a\r\nfever.’\r\n\r\nMiss Hadleigh had been relieved by a good many ‘winks’ during the\r\nperiod specified, although, like many other nurses, she was convinced\r\nthat she had not closed her eyes all the time. Madge accepted the\r\nassertion literally, and was instantly all eagerness to relieve her.\r\n\r\n‘You must get away to Willowmere at once, and take a proper rest. You\r\nare not to refuse, for I will take your place here and do whatever may\r\nbe required. You are looking so ill, Beatrice, that I am sure Philip\r\nand—somebody else would consider me an unfeeling creature if I allowed\r\nyou to stay any longer.’\r\n\r\n‘But it is my duty to stay, dear,’ said Miss Hadleigh a little faintly,\r\nfor she did not like to hear that she was looking ill.\r\n\r\n‘And it is my duty to relieve you. Besides, Dr Joy has given us some\r\nhope that it may be safe to remove your father to our house to-day; and\r\nthen you will be there, refreshed and ready to receive him.’\r\n\r\n‘I suppose you are right—I am not fit for much at present,’ said Miss\r\nHadleigh languidly; ‘and you can do everything for him a great deal\r\nbetter than I can. But I must wait till Philip comes—he promised to be\r\nhere early.’\r\n\r\n‘You have heard from him, then?’\r\n\r\n‘Heard from him!—he was here last night as soon as he could get away\r\nfrom that nasty business he has been swindled into by our nice Uncle\r\nShield. He ought to have taken poor papa’s advice at the beginning, and\r\nhave had nothing to do with him.’\r\n\r\nThis was uttered so spitefully, that it seemed as if there were an\r\nundercurrent of satisfaction in the young lady’s mind at finding that\r\nthe rich uncle who would only acknowledge one member of the family, had\r\nturned out a deceiver.\r\n\r\nMadge was astonished and chagrined by the information that Philip had\r\nbeen out on the previous evening and had made no sign to her; but in\r\nthe prospect of seeing him soon, she put the chagrin aside, remembering\r\nhow harassed he was at this juncture in his affairs. There should\r\nbe no silly lovers’ quarrel between them, if she could help it. She\r\nwould take the plain, commonplace view of the position, and make every\r\nallowance for any eccentricity he might display. She would help him in\r\nspite of himself, by showing that no alteration of circumstances could\r\nalter her love, and that she was ready to wait for him all her life if\r\nshe could not serve him in any other way. To be sure, he had said the\r\nengagement was at an end; and Uncle Dick had not yet said that it was\r\nto stand good. But she loved Philip: her life was his, and misfortune\r\nought to draw them nearer to one another than all the glories of\r\nsuccess—than all the riches in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen he came, there was no sign of astonishment at her presence in the\r\ntemporary refuge of his father: he seemed to accept it as a matter of\r\ncourse that she should be there. Neither was there any sign that he\r\nremembered the manner in which they had last parted. To her anxious\r\neyes he seemed to have grown suddenly very old. The frank joyous voice\r\nwas hushed into a low grave whisper; the cheeks and eyes were sunken;\r\nand there was in his manner a cold self-possession that chilled her.\r\nYet something in the touch of his hand reassured her: love was still\r\nin his heart, although the careless youth, full of bright dreams and\r\nfancies, was changed into the man, who, through loss and suffering, had\r\ncome to realise the stern realities of life.\r\n\r\nThey were for a time prevented from speaking together in private\r\nbecause the doctors had arrived only a few minutes before Philip, and\r\nhe waited to hear their report. Dr Joy came out of the invalid’s room\r\nwith an expression which was serious but confident.\r\n\r\n‘Our patient goes on admirably,’ he said. ‘You need have no fear of\r\nany immediate danger; and in six months there will be only a few scars\r\nto show the danger he has passed through. I am to stay here for a\r\ncouple of hours, and then I shall know whether or not we can move him\r\nto Willowmere. By that time, too, I expect the ambulance we wrote for\r\nlast night will be here.—And you, Miss Hadleigh, you really must take\r\nrest. I insist upon it. You will not make your father better by making\r\nyourself ill. Go and get to bed. Philip and Miss Heathcote will do\r\neverything that is necessary, and I shall be their overseer.’\r\n\r\nPhilip went to the stables to tell Toomey to bring the carriage\r\nround for his sister. As he was crossing the little green on his way\r\nback to the cottage, Madge met him. Although he had not observed her\r\napproaching, his head being bowed and eyes fixed on the ground, he\r\ntook the outstretched hands without any sign of surprise, without any\r\nindication that he understood the cruel significance of the ‘good-bye’\r\nwhich had caused them both so much pain. Whatever hesitation she might\r\nhave felt as to the course she was to pursue was removed by his first\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n‘You want to speak to me, Madge,’ he said in a tone of gentle gravity;\r\nand then with a faint smile: ‘I am better than when you saw me last,\r\nfor I am free from suspense. My position is clear to me now, and I\r\nfeel that a man is more at ease when the final blow falls and strikes\r\nhim down, than he can be whilst he is struggling vainly for the goal\r\nhe has not strength enough to reach. It is a great relief to know that\r\nwe are beaten and to be able to own it. Then there is a possibility of\r\nplodding on to the end without much pain.’\r\n\r\nShe was as much alarmed by this absolute surrender to adversity as she\r\nhad been by the strange humour which had prompted him to say that she\r\nwas free.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Philip, I want to speak to you,’ she said tenderly, and a\r\nspasmodic movement of the hand which grasped hers, signified that the\r\nelectric current of affection was not yet broken. She went on the more\r\nearnestly: ‘I am not going to think about the foolish things you have\r\nsaid to me: I am going to ask you to give me your confidence—to tell me\r\neverything that has happened during the last two days. Tell it to me,\r\nif you like, as to your friend.’\r\n\r\n‘Always my friend,’ he muttered, bending forward as if to kiss her\r\nbrow, and then drawing slowly back, like one who checks himself in the\r\ncommission of some error.\r\n\r\n‘Always your friend,’ she echoed with emphasis, ‘and therefore you\r\nshould be able to speak freely.’\r\n\r\n‘There is not much to tell you. The ruin is more complete than even I\r\nimagined it to be, and the fault is mine. Your friend—I ought to say\r\nour friend—Mr Beecham has made a generous offer for the business, and,\r\nwith certain modifications, will allow it to be carried on under my\r\nmanagement. This relieves us from immediate difficulties; and in a\r\nshort time Mr Shield expects to have recovered sufficiently from his\r\nrecent losses to be able to assist me in redeeming all that has been\r\nlost.’\r\n\r\n‘What gladder news could there be than this?’ she exclaimed with cheeks\r\naglow and brightening eyes; ‘and yet you tell it as if it gave you no\r\npleasure. Philip, Philip! this is not like you—it is not right to be so\r\nmelancholy when the future is so bright.’\r\n\r\n‘Is it so bright? Are you forgetting how long it must be before I can\r\nrepay Mr Shield? before’——\r\n\r\nHe was going to say, ‘before I can ask you to risk your future in mine,\r\nand what changes may take place meanwhile!’\r\n\r\nThe earnest tender eyes were fixed upon him, and they were reading his\r\nthoughts, whilst she appeared to be waiting for him to complete the\r\ninterrupted sentence. She saw the colour slowly rising on his brow, and\r\nknew that he was feeling ashamed of the doubt implied in his thought.\r\n\r\n‘I want to tell you something,’ she said in her quiet brave way, ‘and\r\nI hope—no, I _believe_ that it will take one disagreeable fancy out of\r\nyour head. I know that you did not mean what you said to me on that\r\ndreadful evening.’\r\n\r\n‘What else could a ruined man say?’ (This huskily and turning his face\r\naside.)\r\n\r\n‘He could say that he trusted his friends. Even Uncle Dick is angry\r\nwith you for imagining that your misfortune could make any difference\r\nin his feelings towards you. And for me, you _ought_ to say ... but\r\nthere, I am not going to speak about what you ought to say to me; I am\r\nonly going to tell you what I shall do.’\r\n\r\nHe looked quickly at her, and the eager inquiry on his pale face\r\nrendered the words ‘What is that?’ superfluous.\r\n\r\n‘I shall wait until you come for me; and when you come, I shall be\r\nready to go with you where you will, whether you are poor or rich. No\r\nmatter what anybody says—no matter what _you_ say, I shall wait.’\r\n\r\n‘O Madge!’\r\n\r\nHe could say nothing more; the man’s soul was in that whisper. Their\r\nhands were clasped: they were looking into each other’s eyes: the world\r\nseemed to sink away from them; and the woman’s devotion changed the\r\nwinter into summer, changed the man’s ruin into success.\r\n\r\nHe drew her arm within his; and they walked past the blackened walls of\r\nthe Manor, and along the paths where they had spent so many pleasant\r\nhours during his recovery from the accident with the horse, to the\r\nplace where he had thrown off the doctor’s control and got out of the\r\nwheel-chair.\r\n\r\n‘I am not so sorry now for what has happened,’ were his first words.\r\n‘It is worth losing everything to gain so much.’\r\n\r\n‘But you have not lost everything, Philip.’\r\n\r\n‘No; I should say that I have won everything. I am glad to have saved\r\nWrentham from penal servitude, for his frauds have enabled me to\r\nrealise the greatest of all blessings—the knowledge that come what may\r\nyou can make me happy.’\r\n\r\n‘And I am happy too,’ she said softly, their arms tightening as they\r\nwalked on again in silence.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by he lifted his head, and seemed to shake the frost from his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n‘The doctor said I ought to have rest. I have got it from you, Madge.\r\nI can look straight again at the whole botheration—thank you, my\r\ndarling.’ (A gentle pressure on his arm was the answer, and he went\r\non.) ‘The arrangement offered by Beecham is a very good and kind one,\r\nwhich will enable me in course of time to clear myself whilst carrying\r\nout my scheme; we can take a small house; Mr Shield will live with us,\r\nand we must try to make him comfortable. Then we need not wait for the\r\nend of next harvest, unless you still insist’——\r\n\r\n‘No, Philip; when you bid me come to you, I am ready.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIGARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been abundantly shown by various writers that the Indians of\r\nNorth America as well as elsewhere looked upon tobacco as having a\r\ndivine origin, as being a peculiar and special gift designed by the\r\n‘Good Spirit’ for their delectation, and that it held a prominent place\r\nin their visions of a future life in the ‘happy hunting-grounds.’ In\r\nthe present day, there seems to be an ever increasing dependence on—we\r\nmight almost say slavery to—the plant, whose soothing influences are\r\ncalled in quest to counteract the effects of this high-pressure age.\r\nThere are not a few of its devotees who are quite at one with Salvation\r\nYeo in _Westward Ho_, who, when speaking of tobacco, says: ‘For when\r\nall things were made, none was made better than this; to be a lone\r\nman’s companion, a bachelor’s friend, a hungry man’s food, a sad man’s\r\ncordial, a wakeful man’s sleep, and a chilly man’s fire. There’s no\r\nherb like unto it under the canopy of heaven.’ We do not, however,\r\npropose to discuss the opposing views held by the smoker and the\r\nanti-smoker, but intend to restrict ourselves to some remarks on the\r\nmanufacture of cigars, which have been suggested by a recent visit to\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\nOf the endless varieties of cigars which are met with in various\r\ntropical localities, the majority are used for local consumption, and\r\nonly find their way into England in very small quantities. The bulk of\r\nour cigars are either Havana or Manila, European or British, and of\r\nthese it has been computed that considerably over two hundred million\r\nare consumed annually in the United Kingdom. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat the manufacture of this luxury is a business of great magnitude,\r\nirrespective of the other forms of tobacco used; and if we remember\r\nthat the duty obtained from tobacco of all kinds puts nearly nine\r\nmillions per annum into the national exchequer, it becomes possible to\r\nrealise how much the comfort and happiness of a large number of Her\r\nMajesty’s subjects depend on the products of the tobacco crop.\r\n\r\nAn Havana cigar of a good brand is deservedly looked upon as the _crême\r\nde la crême_ of cigars; but, unfortunately, the number of good makers\r\nas well as the possible production of first-class cigars is necessarily\r\nlimited. Thus the manufacture of the ‘Villar y Villar’ brand is stated\r\nto be never more than twenty-five thousand daily; while that of ‘Henry\r\nClays’ is fully three times as many. For some time back there has\r\nbeen a deterioration in Havanas, which has been variously accounted\r\nfor. It is asserted that, from the exhaustive nature of the crop,\r\nguano or other artificial stimulants are largely used, and that the\r\nflavour of the leaf has suffered in consequence. Besides, owing to the\r\nincreasing demand, tobacco has been grown on poor land unsuitable for\r\nthe production of the finest leaf, and even has been largely imported\r\ninto Cuba for the manufacture of ‘genuine’ Havanas. To those, however,\r\nwho cannot afford to buy the best brands, it is satisfactory to know\r\nthat a new source of supply is being opened up with great energy. The\r\nclimate and soil of some parts of Jamaica very closely resemble those\r\nof Havana, and are well suited for the growth of the finest leaf. As\r\nthe Jamaica planters open up their virgin soil, it is safe to predict\r\nthat with growing experience they will improve in their manufactures,\r\nwhile already they produce a cigar which compares favourably with any\r\nbut the best of Cuban make.\r\n\r\nBritish cigars, like all other varieties, may be good, bad, or\r\nindifferent. By British we mean cigars manufactured in this country\r\nfrom the imported leaf; and as English capital can command the markets,\r\nthere is no reason why the best tobacco should not be obtainable for\r\nimportation. Using the same quality of leaf, a cigar can be produced\r\nin this country at a much lower cost than if imported ready made.\r\nWe venture to think, notwithstanding popular prejudice, that a good\r\nBritish cigar is preferable to an inferior foreign make. Pay a fair\r\nprice, and you will get a good article—home made, in spite of the\r\nSpanish labels, which are always used either from affectation or in\r\norder to deceive the ignorant. Much is heard about adulteration by\r\nmeans of cabbage-leaves, &c.; but we believe that it is almost unknown\r\nin this country. The fact that inferior tobaccos are so very cheap\r\nmakes fraud both unlikely and unnecessary. Adulteration, however, is\r\nnot unknown on the continent, where cigars can be obtained six and ten\r\nfor a penny; but the duty of five shillings per pound is fortunately a\r\nbar to their importation into Great Britain. It is needless to say more\r\nabout continental cigars than we do about all cheap cigars, and that is\r\nto recommend smokers to avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of the finished article requires highly skilled\r\nlabour, and long practice gives the workman an amount of accuracy and\r\ndexterity in producing cigar after cigar, alike in shape and size,\r\nwith a rapidity that is truly wonderful. After the leaves have been\r\nproperly cured, they are sorted according to size and colour. The\r\ncentre rib is then extracted, an operation requiring great care. Each\r\nworkman is seated before a flat board, and is supplied with a bunch\r\nof perfect leaves and a pile of broken tobacco. With his fingers, he\r\nquickly rolls up some broken pieces, inclosing them in one of the less\r\nperfect leaves, forming what is called ‘the bunch.’ This he proceeds to\r\ncover with the wrapper or perfect leaf, which he has already cut with\r\nhis knife to the required size. The most difficult part of the process\r\nhas now to be completed, namely, closing in the point. This he does by\r\nmodelling it with his fingers, quickly twisting the wrapper round it,\r\nand fixing the end with a drop of gum. With one sweep of his knife—his\r\nonly implement—he trims the broad end, and the cigar is ready to be\r\ncarried to the drying-room, afterwards to be sorted and packed in boxes.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to know a good cigar when you smoke one than to describe\r\nthe points by which a good cigar may be selected. A good cigar,\r\nhowever, should have a good wrapper or exterior; it should have a faint\r\ngloss, not amounting to greasiness, due to the essential oil contained\r\nin it; and it should have a fine hairy ‘down’ on its surface. In\r\naddition to this, it should be firmly rolled, and yet not be hard, or\r\nit will not draw well. When lighted it should burn evenly, and not to\r\none side; it should carry a two-inch ash without endangering your coat,\r\nand if laid aside for three or four minutes, should still be alight\r\nwhen taken up again. It is worth remembering the golden rule known to\r\nthe lovers of the fragrant weed, namely, when holding a lighted cigar,\r\nalways to keep the burning end turned upwards, so that the smoke may\r\nescape into the air—never downwards, as that causes the smoke to pass\r\nthrough the body of the cigar.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these brief remarks, it may not be amiss to say a word\r\nor two about the markings which will be found on the boxes, and about\r\nwhich a good deal of ignorance exists. On most boxes there are four\r\ndistinct markings, which have each their own significance. First comes\r\nthe brand proper, which consists either of the maker’s name or of some\r\nfancy name adopted by the firm; such, for example, as Partagas, Villar\r\ny Villar, Intimidads, Henry Clays, &c. The quality of the tobacco is\r\nnext indicated by Flor Fina, first quality; Flor, second quality, &c.\r\nVarious names, such as Infantes, Reinas, Imperiales, &c., are used to\r\nrepresent the size or shape of the cigar. The fourth mark gives us an\r\nidea of the strength or colour of the tobacco contained in the box; and\r\nfor this purpose the following terms are used—Claro, Colorado claro,\r\nMaduro, &c. To attempt to give any advice to our readers as to the best\r\nbrands to buy would be beyond the scope of this paper. Experience will\r\nsoon teach them what to accept and what to avoid; what suits their\r\ntastes and their pockets, and what does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE WOMAN’S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n‘Phew! There’s not a breath of air in this valley. One had need be a\r\nsalamander to appreciate a morning like this. But what a lovely nook it\r\nis—eh, Mac? Quite worth coming half-a-dozen miles to see.’\r\n\r\n‘That it’s very pretty, I’ll not attempt to deny; but still’——\r\n\r\n‘By no means equal to what you could show us t’other side of the\r\nBorder,’ said the vicar with a twinkle. ‘That’s understood, of course.’\r\n\r\nThe time was the forenoon of the day following the evening on which\r\nMadame De Vigne had been so startled by the sudden appearance of one\r\nwhom she had every reason to believe had died long years before.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a small but romantic glen. Over the summit of a cliff, at\r\nthe upper end of a rocky ravine, a stream, which took its rise among\r\nthe stern hills that shut in the background, leapt in a cascade of\r\nfeathery foam. After a fall of some fifteen or twenty feet, it reached\r\na broad, shallow basin, in which it spread itself out, as if to gather\r\nbreath for its second leap, which, however, was not quite so formidable\r\nas its first one. After this, still babbling its own liquid music, it\r\nfretted its way among the boulders with which its channel was thickly\r\nstrewn, and so, after a time, left the valley behind it; and then, less\r\nnoisily, and lingering lovingly by many a quiet pool, it gradually\r\ncrept onward to the lake, in the deep bosom of whose dark waters lay\r\nthe peace for which it seemed to have been craving so long.\r\n\r\nA steep and somewhat rugged pathway wound up either side of the glen to\r\nthe tableland at the summit, overhung with trees and shrubs of various\r\nkinds, with a rustic seat planted here and there at some specially\r\nromantic point of view. Ferns, mosses, flowers, and grasses innumerable\r\nclothed the rocky sides of the ravine down almost to the water’s\r\nedge. At the foot of the glen the stream was spanned by a quaint old\r\nbridge, on which the vicar and Dr M‘Murdo were now standing. It was\r\nthe day of the picnic of which Madame De Vigne had made mention to\r\nColonel Woodruffe, and the party from the _Palatine_ had driven over\r\nin a couple of wagonettes, which, together with the hampers containing\r\nluncheon, were stationed in a shady spot a quarter of a mile lower down\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\n‘Look, Mac, look!’ exclaimed the vicar, ‘at those two speckled darlings\r\nlurking there in the shadow of the bridge. I must come and try my luck\r\nhere one of these days.’\r\n\r\n‘You look just a bit feckless this morning without your rod and basket.’\r\n\r\n‘Where was the use of bringing them? No trout worth calling a trout\r\nwould rise on a morning like this, when there’s not a cloud in the\r\nsky as big as one’s hand, and not breeze enough to raise a ripple on\r\nthe water. I’ve brought my hammer instead, so that I shan’t want for\r\namusement. Ah, Mac, what a pity it is that you care nothing either for\r\nangling or geology!’\r\n\r\n‘I could not be fashed, as we used to say in the North. Every man to\r\nhis likes. I’ve got a treatise in my pocket on _The Diaphragm and its\r\nFunctions_, just down from London, with diagrams and plates. Now, if I\r\ncan only find a shady nook somewhere, I’ve no doubt that I shall enjoy\r\nmyself with my book for the next two or three hours quite as much as\r\nyou with your rod or hammer.’\r\n\r\n‘So that’s your idea of a picnic, is it?’ The question came from Miss\r\nGaisford, who had come unperceived upon the two friends as they were\r\nleaning over the parapet of the bridge. ‘To bury yourself among the\r\ntrees, eh,’ she went on, ‘and gloat over some dreadful pictures that\r\nnobody but a doctor could look at without shuddering? Allow me to tell\r\nyou that you will be permitted to do nothing of the kind. You will just\r\nput your treatise in your pocket, and try for once to make yourself\r\nsociable. Perhaps, if you try very hard, you may even succeed in making\r\nyourself agreeable.’\r\n\r\n‘My poor Mac!’ murmured the vicar as he settled his spectacles more\r\nfirmly on his nose.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said nothing, but his eyes twinkled, and he pursed up his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n‘I have arranged my plans for both of you,’ said Miss Pen with emphasis.\r\n\r\n‘For both of us!’ they exclaimed simultaneously.\r\n\r\n‘Yes. Lady Renshaw’——\r\n\r\n‘O-h!’ It was a double groan.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t interrupt. Lady Renshaw will be here presently. As soon as she\r\nappears on the scene, you will take charge of her. I have special\r\nreasons for asking you to do this, which I cannot now explain. You\r\nwill amuse her, interest her, keep her out of the way, and prevent her\r\ngenerally from making a nuisance of herself to any one but yourselves,\r\ntill luncheon-time.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Pen,’ began the vicar.\r\n\r\n‘My dear Miss Gaisford,’ pleaded the doctor.\r\n\r\n‘You will do as you are told, and do it without grumbling,’ was the\r\nlittle woman’s reply as she shook a finger in both their faces. ‘I’ve\r\narranged my plans for the day, and I can’t have them interfered with.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear Pen,’ again persisted the vicar, in his mildest tones, ‘that\r\nyour plan is a perfectly admirable one, I do not for one moment doubt,\r\nonly, as you know very well, I am not and never have been a ladies’\r\nman, and that in the company of your charming sex I’m just as shy\r\nat fifty-five as I was at eighteen. But with Mac here the case is\r\naltogether different. All doctors know how to please and flatter the\r\nsex—it’s part of their stock-in-trade, so that Mac would be quite at\r\nhome with her ladyship; whereas I—well, the fact is I had made up my\r\nmind to walk as far as’——\r\n\r\n‘Blackstone Hollow,’ interrupted his sister, ‘in order that you might\r\nhave another look at that big trout about which you dream every night,\r\nbut which you will never succeed in catching as long as you live.’\r\n\r\n‘The traitor! eh, Miss Penelope?’ cried the doctor. ‘This is neither\r\nmore nor less than prevarication—yes, sir, prevarication—there’s no\r\nother word for it—and you the vicar of a parish, whose example ought to\r\nbe a shining light to all men! Septimus Gaisford, I’m ashamed of you!\r\nAs for Lady Renshaw’—— He ended with a snap of his fingers.\r\n\r\n‘Neither of you is afraid of her. Of course not,’ remarked Miss\r\nPenelope. ‘You would scorn to acknowledge that you are afraid of any\r\nwoman. But why run any risk in the matter? Why allow her ladyship to\r\nattack you separately, when, by keeping together and combining your\r\nforces, you would render your position impregnable?’\r\n\r\n‘Impregnable!’ both the gentlemen gasped out.\r\n\r\nMiss Gaisford’s merry laugh ran up the glen. ‘What a pair of delicious,\r\nelderly nincompoops you are!’ she cried. ‘Septimus, you dear old\r\nsimpleton, haven’t you discovered that this woman would like nothing\r\nbetter than to bring you to your knees with an offer of marriage?’\r\n\r\n‘Good gracious, Pen!’ cried the vicar with a start that nearly shook\r\nthe spectacles off his nose.\r\n\r\n‘Doctor, did you not see enough of her ladyship’s tactics last evening\r\nto understand that her plan with you is to induce you to believe that\r\nshe has fallen in love with you? and when one of your sex gets the\r\nidea into his head that one of our sex is in love with him, why, then,\r\na little reciprocity of sentiment is the almost inevitable result.’\r\n\r\n‘The hussy!’ exclaimed Mac. ‘I should like her to be laid up for a\r\nfortnight and let me have the physicking of her!’\r\n\r\n‘I noticed that she did press my arm rather more than seemed needful,\r\nwhen we were walking last evening by the lake,’ remarked the vicar.\r\n\r\n‘And I remember now that she squeezed my hand in a way that seemed to\r\nme quite unnecessary, when she bade me good-night on the steps of the\r\nhotel.’\r\n\r\n‘Gentlemen, let there be no jealousy between you, I beg,’ said Miss Pen\r\nwith mock-solemnity. ‘If you decline to combine your forces, then make\r\nup your minds which of you is to have her ladyship, and let the other\r\none go and bewail his sorrows to the moon.’\r\n\r\n‘By the way, who _is_ Lady Renshaw?’ asked the vicar. ‘I never had the\r\npleasure of hearing her name till yesterday.’\r\n\r\n‘Her ladyship is the widow of an alderman and ex-sheriff of London,\r\nwho was knighted on the occasion of some great event in the City. Her\r\nhusband, who was much older than herself, left her very well off when\r\nhe died. That pretty girl, her niece, who travels about with her, has\r\nno fortune of her own, and one of her ladyship’s chief objects in life\r\nwould seem to be to find a rich husband for her. At the same time, from\r\nwhat I have already seen of her, it appears to me that Lady Renshaw\r\nherself would by no means object to enter the matrimonial state again,\r\ncould she only find a husband to suit her views.’\r\n\r\n‘A dangerous woman evidently. We must beware of her, Mac,’ said the\r\nvicar.\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook his head. ‘My dear friend, your caution doesn’t apply\r\nto me,’ he said. ‘Lady Renshaw is just one of those women that I would\r\nnot think of making my wife, if she was worth her weight in gold.’\r\n\r\nThey had begun to stroll slowly forward during the last minute or two,\r\nand leaving the bridge behind them, were now presently lost to view\r\ndown one of the many wooded paths which intersected the valley in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBut a few minutes had passed, when Lady Renshaw and Miss Wynter\r\nappeared, advancing slowly in the opposite direction. They halted on\r\nthe bridge as the others had done before them.\r\n\r\n‘What a sweetly pretty place!’ exclaimed Miss Wynter. ‘I had no idea it\r\nwould be half so lovely. I could wander about here for a week,’ adding\r\nunder her breath, ‘especially if I had Dick to keep me company.’\r\n\r\n‘Pooh! my dear; you will have had quite enough of it by luncheon-time,’\r\nresponded her aunt, who had seated herself on the low coping of the\r\nbridge with her back to the view up the glen.\r\n\r\n‘I always thought you were an admirer of pretty scenery, aunt.’\r\n\r\n‘So I am—when in society. But now that we are alone, there’s no need\r\nto go into ecstasies about it. On a broiling day like this, I would\r\nexchange all the scenery of the Lakes for an easy-chair in the veranda,\r\na nice novel, and the music of a band in the distance.’ Then, as if\r\nsuddenly remembering something, she gazed around and said: ‘By-the-bye,\r\nwhat has become of Mr Golightly?’\r\n\r\n‘I saw him strolling in this direction a few minutes ago,’ was the\r\ninnocent answer. ‘I have no doubt that he is somewhere about.’\r\n\r\n‘Now that Archie Ridsdale has been called away, you will be able to\r\ngive him the whole of your attention. There seem plenty of quiet nooks\r\nabout where you will be able to get him for a time all to yourself. He\r\ncertainly seems excessively infatuated, considering how short a time he\r\nhas known you, and I should not be a bit surprised if that waterfall\r\nwere to lead him on to make violent love to you before you are six\r\nhours older.’\r\n\r\n‘Aunt!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, my dear, I’ve known stranger things than that happen. When a\r\nsusceptible young man and a pretty girl sit and watch a waterfall\r\ntogether, he is almost sure before long to begin squeezing her hand,\r\nand then what follows is simply a question of diplomacy on her part.’\r\n\r\n‘If—if—in the course of a few days—Mr Golightly were to propose?’——\r\n\r\n‘He may do it this very day for aught one can tell. He seems\r\ninfatuated enough for any thing. When he does propose, you will accept\r\nhim—conditionally. You will take care to let him see that you care for\r\nhim—a little. You have known him for so short a time that really you\r\nscarcely know your own feelings—&c., &c. Of course, before finally\r\nmaking up your mind, we must have some more definite information as to\r\nthe position and prospects of the young man, and what his father the\r\nbishop has in view as regards his future. Besides, Mr Archie Ridsdale\r\nmay possibly be back in the course of a day or two.’\r\n\r\n‘But in what way can Archie’s return affect me?’\r\n\r\n‘You stupid girl! have I not already told you that Sir William is\r\nnearly sure to refuse his consent, and that Archie’s engagement with\r\nthis Miss Loraine may be broken off at any moment. Then will come your\r\nopportunity. Archie seemed very fond of you at one time, and there’s no\r\nreason why he should not become fond of you again. Young men’s fancies\r\nare as changeable as the wind, as you ought to know quite well by this\r\ntime.’\r\n\r\nBella only shrugged her shoulders and sauntered slowly over the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe expression of Lady Renshaw’s face changed the moment she found\r\nherself alone, and her thoughts reverted to a topic over which they had\r\nbusied themselves earlier in the day.\r\n\r\n‘So this high and mighty Madame De Vigne—this person whom nobody\r\nseems to know anything about—could not condescend to come in the same\r\nwagonette with us poor mortals! She and her sister must follow in a\r\ncarriage by themselves, forsooth! Last evening, when we got back from\r\nthe lake, she had retired for the night; this morning, she breakfasted\r\nin her own room. I feel more convinced than ever that there’s some\r\nmystery about her. If I could but find out what it is! Of course, in\r\nsuch a case it would become my duty at once to communicate with Sir\r\nWilliam.’\r\n\r\nMiss Wynter came back over the bridge, but much more quickly than she\r\nhad gone. ‘Oh, look, aunt!’ she exclaimed; ‘I declare there’s D—— I\r\nmean Mr Golightly, standing yonder, gazing at the water, and all alone.’\r\n\r\nLady Renshaw took a survey of the young man through her glasses.\r\nFeeling safe in his disguise, Richard had now discarded some portions\r\nof the clerical-looking costume he had worn yesterday, and was attired\r\nthis morning more after the style of an ordinary tourist.\r\n\r\n‘You had better stroll gently along in the same direction,’ remarked\r\nher ladyship. ‘Poor young man, he looks very lonely!’\r\n\r\n‘But I can’t leave you alone, aunt.’\r\n\r\n‘Never mind about me. Besides, I see that dear vicar and Dr M‘Murdo\r\ncoming this way.’\r\n\r\nLady Renshaw turned to greet Miss Gaisford and the two gentlemen, who\r\nwere still a little distance off.\r\n\r\n‘Here they come. To which of my two admirers shall I devote myself\r\nto-day?’ she simpered. ‘Why not endeavour to play one off against the\r\nother, and so excite a little jealousy? It is so nice to make the men\r\njealous. Poor dear Sir Timothy never would be jealous; but then he was\r\nso very stupid!’\r\n\r\nMiss Gaisford was the first to speak. ‘We were just wondering what had\r\nbecome of you, Lady Renshaw.’\r\n\r\n‘I lingered here to drink in this fairy scene. It is indeed too, too\r\nexquisitely beautiful.’\r\n\r\n‘If they would only turn on a little more water at the top of the cliff\r\nit would be an improvement,’ answered Miss Pen.—‘Septimus, you might\r\ninquire whether they can’t arrange it specially for us to-day.’\r\n\r\n‘My dear!’ protested the vicar with mild-eyed amazement.\r\n\r\n‘Maybe, like myself,’ remarked the doctor, ‘your ladyship is a\r\nworshipper of beautiful scenery?’\r\n\r\n‘O yes. I dote on it—I revel in it. After I lost poor dear Sir Timothy,\r\nI went to Switzerland, in the hope of being able to distract my mind by\r\ntravel. Those darling Alps, I shall always feel grateful to them!’\r\n\r\n‘What did the Alps do for you, Lady Renshaw?’ queried Miss Pen with the\r\nutmost gravity.\r\n\r\n‘They gave me back my peace of mind; they poured consolation into my\r\nlacerated heart.’\r\n\r\n‘Very kind of them—very kind indeed,’ answered Miss Pen drily.\r\n\r\nLady Renshaw threw a quick, suspicious glance at her. ‘What a very\r\nstrange person!’ she murmured. The vicar’s sister was a puzzle to her.\r\nIt could not be that she was covertly making fun of her, Lady Renshaw!\r\nNo; the idea was too preposterous.\r\n\r\nDr Mac had not gone about for fifty years with his eyes shut. He\r\nhad discovered that many persons, both male and female, who plume\r\nthemselves on their knowledge of the world and their shrewdness in\r\ndealing with the common affairs of life, are yet as susceptible to\r\nflattery, even of the most fulsome kind, and just as liable to be\r\nled away by it into the regions of foolishness, as their far less\r\nsophisticated fellow-mortals. What if this woman, with all her\r\nworldly-mindedness and calculating selfishness, were one of those\r\nindividuals who may be dexterously led by the nose and persuaded to\r\ndance to any tune so long as their ears are judiciously tickled? A\r\npeculiar gleam came into the doctor’s eyes as these thoughts passed\r\nthrough his mind. He cleared his voice and turned to her ladyship.\r\n\r\n‘It appears to me, Lady Renshaw,’ he began, ‘speaking from a\r\nprofessional point of view, that you are gifted with one of those\r\nhighly-strung, super-sensitive, and poetical organisations which\r\nrender those who possess them peculiarly susceptible to all beautiful\r\ninfluences whether of nature or of art. Hem.’\r\n\r\n‘How thoroughly you understand me, Dr M‘Murdo!’ responded her ladyship,\r\nbeaming on him with one of her broadest smiles.\r\n\r\nThe vicar took off his spectacles and proceeded to rub them vigorously\r\nwith his handkerchief. ‘Mac, you are nothing better than a barefaced\r\nhumbug,’ he whispered to himself.\r\n\r\n‘It would seem only natural, my dear madam,’ resumed the unblushing\r\ndoctor, ‘that a temperament such as yours, which throbs responsive to\r\nbeauty in all its thousand varied forms as readily as an Æolian harp\r\nresponds to the faintest sigh of the summer breeze, should—should find\r\nan outlet for itself in one form or other. Have you never, may I ask,\r\nattempted to pour out your thick crowding fancies in verse? Have you\r\nnever, while gazing on some such scene as this, felt as if you could\r\nfloat away on—on the wings of Poesy? Have you never, in brief, felt as\r\nif you could only find relief by rushing into song? Hem.’\r\n\r\nThe poor vicar fairly gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes; that is exactly how I have felt a thousand times,’ gushed\r\nher ladyship. ‘At such moments I seem to exhale poetry.’\r\n\r\n‘Dear me! rather a remarkable phenomenon,’ murmured Miss Pen.\r\n\r\n‘I long to be a dryad—or a nymph—or one of Dian’s huntresses in some\r\nArcadian grove of old.’\r\n\r\n‘A nymph! Hum,’ remarked the vicar softly to himself.\r\n\r\n‘But I have never yet ventured to—to’——\r\n\r\n‘Gush into song,’ suggested Miss Pen.\r\n\r\n‘To attempt to clothe my thoughts in rhythmic measures,’ went on\r\nher ladyship with a little wave of the hand, as though deprecating\r\ninterruption, ‘although I have often felt an inward voice which\r\nimpelled me to do so.’\r\n\r\n‘Let me advise you to try, my dear madam,’ resumed the doctor with his\r\ngravest professional air. ‘If I may be allowed to say so, you have the\r\neye of a poet—dreamy, imaginative, with a sort of far-away gaze in it,\r\nas though you were looking at something a long way off which nobody but\r\nyourself could see.’\r\n\r\n‘Ought I to listen to these things in silence?’ asked the vicar of\r\nhimself with a sudden qualm of conscience.\r\n\r\n‘You are a great, naughty flatterer, Dr M‘Murdo,’ said the widow,\r\nshaking a podgy finger archly at him.\r\n\r\n‘Madam, that is one of the points on which my education has been\r\nshamefully neglected.’\r\n\r\nShe turned with a smile. ‘I trust that our dear vicar is also a\r\nworshipper of the beautiful?’\r\n\r\n‘With Lady Renshaw before my eyes, it would be rank heresy to doubt\r\nit,’ stammered the dear old boy with a blush that would have become a\r\nlad of eighteen.\r\n\r\n‘Pass up one, Septimus,’ whispered his sister in his ear.\r\n\r\n‘If you talk to me in that strain, I shall begin to think you a very,\r\nvery dangerous man,’ simpered her ladyship.\r\n\r\n‘There’s a charming view of the lake from an opening in the trees a\r\nlittle farther on,’ remarked Dr Mac. ‘Would not your ladyship like to\r\nwalk as far?’\r\n\r\n‘By all means, though I am loath to tear myself from this exquisite\r\nspot.’\r\n\r\n‘We shall find our way back to it later on.’\r\n\r\n‘With your permission, I will leave you good people for a little\r\nwhile,’ remarked Miss Pen. ‘I’ve other fish to fry.’\r\n\r\nHer ladyship stared. ‘What an excessively vulgar remark!’ was her\r\nunspoken thought.\r\n\r\nMiss Gaisford turned to her. ‘Lady Renshaw, I must intrust these two\r\nyoung sparks into your hands for a time.’\r\n\r\n‘You could not leave us in more charming captivity,’ remarked the\r\ngallant doctor.\r\n\r\nThe vicar, as he fingered the hammer in his pocket, looked imploringly\r\nat his sister, but she pretended not to see.\r\n\r\n‘Au revoir, then, dear Miss Gaisford,’ said her ladyship in her most\r\naffable tones.\r\n\r\n‘Au revoir, au revoir.’\r\n\r\nAs the three went sauntering away, the vicar lagging a little behind\r\nthe others, Miss Pen heard the doctor say: ‘You know the song, Lady\r\nRenshaw, _When I view those Scenes so charming_,’ after which nothing\r\nbut a murmur reached her ears.\r\n\r\nShe turned away with a little laugh. ‘The doctor will fool her to\r\nthe top of her bent. Who would have thought that high-dried piece of\r\nbuckram had so much quiet fun in him?—And now to look after my hampers.\r\nIf I trust to the servants, by luncheon-time the ice, like Niobe, will\r\nhave wept itself away, the corkscrew will have taken a ramble on its\r\nown account, the vinegar and salt will have gone into housekeeping\r\ntogether, and the mustard will be making love to the blanc-mange. My\r\nreputation is at stake.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN NEWSPAPERS ON THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been fairly proved in previous numbers of this _Journal_ that\r\nso long as advertising continues, a newspaper can rarely be altogether\r\ndull, for the curiosities of the advertisement columns often exhibit\r\nstrange freaks and fancies of human nature, which may afford amusement\r\nwhen the news columns are at their grimmest and dreariest. But the\r\nplace of all others which may be regarded as the headquarters of the\r\nadvertising genius is the land across the Atlantic, and the papers\r\nwhich are the medium of the greatest enterprise in this line are the\r\n_Tribunes_ and _Suns_ of the United States; and most entertaining of\r\nall are the announcements by which the American journals draw attention\r\nto their own brilliant pages. An English newspaper directory is not\r\nvery attractive, except to the business portion of the community;\r\nbut an American publication of the kind is of a much more amusing\r\ncharacter; and in two bulky and comprehensive volumes, an indomitable\r\ntransatlantic publisher has issued a universal gazetteer, wherein the\r\nnewspapers of every part of the globe may be studied.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is enough for an English paper, as a rule, to\r\nstate the town and county it represents; but young America must do\r\nmore than this, if readers outside her various regions are to estimate\r\nthe value of her press. Jacksonville or Euteroga must be set forth as\r\nindisputably the most thriving city in the richest district of the\r\nmost prosperous State. Magnolia, advertisers are ‘notified,’ is a\r\n‘flourishing town with more than twenty-five business-houses;’ Augusta\r\n‘is growing and has a bright future;’ Westfield is ‘a thriving town\r\nof above a thousand inhabitants,’ clearly affording scope for a large\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nManchester (United States), we learn, in a sentence racy of the soil,\r\n‘is a large, live, and growing city, makes one hundred and seventy-nine\r\nmiles of cloth per day, can build fifteen locomotives a month, and\r\nfifty steam fire-engines a year, and an endless variety of other\r\nproducts of skill and industry.’ Another rising spot has ‘fourteen\r\ngrocery, three hardware, and five dry goods stores, four tailor-shops,\r\nsix butcher-shops, two banks, four hotels, three grist-mills, two\r\nstave-factories, foundry, planing-mills, &c., and six churches, one of\r\nwhich cost about sixteen thousand dollars, and has a spire one hundred\r\nand forty-eight feet high.’ But this edifice is outdone in a third town\r\nwhich ‘points with just pride to its magnificent iron bridge, costing\r\nover forty thousand dollars, and other evidences of public enterprise.’\r\nMiddle Loup Valley is, we are told, ‘one of the largest and most\r\nproductive valleys in the State, which is from its picturesque scenery\r\nand fertility of soil poetically called the “Rhine of America.”’\r\nAnother touch of poetry is come across unexpectedly: ‘A belt of fire\r\nfrom thousands of coke ovens surrounds Mount Pleasant, the centre of\r\nthe great Connellsville Coke County, and the place where the _Times and\r\nMining Journal_ is published;’ and there is a rhythmical swing about\r\nthe remark that the _Honey Grove Independent_ ‘is published in the land\r\nwhere cotton grows rank and tall, and where cattle grow fat in the\r\nwild prairies.’ But Honey Grove with its cattle is nothing to Hancock\r\nCounty, where ‘the people have become so corpulent, that the druggists\r\nare all becoming independently rich from the sale of Allen’s Anti-Fat;’\r\nand the Blue Grass Valley of Kentucky ‘is famous all over the world for\r\nits handsome women, thoroughbred horses, rich soil, and fine climate.’\r\n\r\nTo be worthy of a land like this, the newspapers also possess rare\r\nattractions for readers and advertisers, the latter especially. They\r\nare ‘alive and growing’ ‘newsy! pithy! spicy!’ one is a ‘paper for all\r\nmankind,’ another ‘overflows with local gossip,’ and a third ‘discusses\r\npublic questions with lively respectability, and feeds its readers with\r\nno less than four and often five columns of spicy local matter each\r\nweek;’ a fourth has ‘everything first-class;’ you can get ‘a bright and\r\nnewsy wide-awake local paper,’ or ‘a live thirty-two column weekly;’\r\nand the _Eaton Rapids Journal_ will be found, appropriately to its\r\nname, ‘a live paper in a live town.’ Yet more richly descriptive is the\r\naccount of the ‘red-hot local paper that feeds twenty thousand people\r\nevery week and makes them fat; advertisements can reach millions of\r\nhungry minds through this medium.’ Again, we learn that ‘Life on the\r\nocean wave is nothing compared with reading the _Plymouth Pantograph_.’\r\nThe _Sacramento Bee_ is ‘the spiciest, ablest, most brilliant, and\r\nmost independent journal published on the Pacific coast;’ while for\r\n‘talking large,’ honourable mention should also be accorded to one\r\nof Cincinnati’s lights, which is ‘the best paper ever published. All\r\nits news is first-hand from upwards of fifteen hundred reporters and\r\ncorrespondents in every part of the United States and Europe.’\r\n\r\nBut these are mere outward characteristics and generalisations.\r\nPolitics denote more distinctly the paper’s line of action, whether\r\n‘stalwart Republican,’ ‘sound Democratic,’ or ‘Independent in all\r\nthings, neutral in nothing.’ Independence is the cry of many; they are\r\n‘bold and fearless,’ express a hatred of party, rings and ringsters.\r\n‘Now in its third volume,’ exults one banner of freedom, ‘and has\r\nnever halted by the way nor wearied of the fight. Always ready to take\r\nup the cause of the poor and oppressed, and never ready to surrender\r\nits independence to party, clique, or ring.’ ‘Has no axe to grind\r\nother than the advancement of every social reform,’ a second patriot\r\nproclaims. ‘Therefore it hits a head whenever that head is seen in\r\nopposition to true advancement.’ For the extremes of party violence we\r\nmust go to a Southern journal, which does not, it may well be hoped,\r\n‘speak as the masses of our people feel and talk;’ if it does, so much\r\nthe worse for the people. ‘If the Yankees,’ this rodomontade begins,\r\n‘want to know the real sentiments of our people; if they want to have a\r\nrealising sense of the utter madness of trying to govern the grand old\r\nsovereign States of the Confederacy, they will close their ears to the\r\nlying professions of our policy-bumming politicians and subscribe to\r\nthe _Bartlett News_.’ Perhaps some such rant as that of the _Bartlett\r\nNews_ a certain _Labor Standard_ had in view while stating itself to be\r\n‘not a blowing, blustering, black-mail sheet which has to be read in\r\nprivate because its contents are unfit to be seen in the family,’ but\r\n‘a clean live weekly paper, devoted entirely to the interests of the\r\nworking-classes.’\r\n\r\nA Texan organ ‘will seek to be a photograph of all the resources\r\nand needs of Texas; a mirror of her markets; a barometer of pure\r\nprinciples, sound public faith, and private honour. Democratic, but\r\nconservative, independent and outspoken in the exalted interests\r\nof just criticism—no panderer to partisan men or measures, whether\r\nright or wrong!’ This is independence with a vengeance, ahead even of\r\nthe gazette which ‘favours immigration, morality, and the Christian\r\nreligion; and unflinchingly opposes shams, rings, rogues, and enemies\r\nto the people. It exposes villainy and crime wherever found, and hence\r\nis read by the more intelligent classes of people in the field where it\r\ncirculates.’\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of immigration and the Christian religion reminds one\r\nof the much bemourned lady who ‘painted in water-colours and of such\r\nis the kingdom of heaven.’ But there is a still more frank linking\r\ntogether of things temporal and spiritual in the ‘only Democratic\r\nout-and-out paper in Western Iowa,’ which sails under the motto, more\r\nYankee than reverent, ‘Fear God, tell the truth, and make money;’\r\nthe editor further announcing that if he ‘is allowed to live under a\r\nRepublican administration another year, he will carry your advertising\r\nat five cents per line, fifty dollars per column, or furnish his paper\r\nfor one dollar fifty cents per year.’\r\n\r\nThe _Horseheads Journal and Chemung Co. Greenback_ ‘exposes\r\nrascality everywhere, and aims to give something to interest and\r\ninstruct everybody every week,’ from which it may be surmised that\r\nthe _Horseheads Journal and Chemung Co. Greenback_ is happier in\r\nits object than in its title. Many of these ‘wide-awake and spicy’\r\nrepresentatives of Western culture are not remarkable for the elegance\r\nof their names, the admixture of Indian and American resulting in\r\nsome curious compounds, such as the _Petrolea Topic_, the _Klickitat\r\nSentinel_, the _Katahdin Kalendar_, the _Waxahachie Enterprise_, and\r\nthe _Coshocton Age_. Yankee, pure and simple, reigns in the _Weekly\r\nBlade_, _Jacksonian_, _Biggsville Clipper_, _People’s Telephone_, and\r\n_New Haven Palladium_; but there is a charm of euphony about the _Xenia\r\nSunlight_ and _Golden Globe_, and the brevity which may be the soul of\r\nwit in the _Call_, _Item_, _Plaindealer_, and _Editor’s Eye_.\r\n\r\nThe editors, as is well known, come much more to the front than is\r\nthe case in England; they do not remain the invisible and mysterious\r\n‘we’ of the editorial sanctum; their names are frequently advertised\r\nwith those of the publishers, occasionally, indeed, accompanied by\r\na portrait or other additional recommendation; one paper ‘is edited\r\nby two of the ablest newspaper men in the State, and it will be hard\r\nto find a better team in the editorial harness.’ ‘The most important\r\nfeature,’ we learn, ‘of the _Free Press_ is its funny squibs by the\r\neditor, “Driftings from Dreamland,” which are original and spicy;’ and\r\nas appropriately named, surely, is ‘a humorous department, “Tea and\r\nToast,”’ to be found in another print. A Texas editor offers ‘upon\r\njustifiable encouragement to visit any county or city in Texas or\r\nMexico and make a statistical “write-up” of their every interest and\r\nadvantage,’ indicative of lively and reliable information for intending\r\nimmigrants; and a _Highland Recorder_, with an affection for the Land\r\no’ Cakes one can but sympathise with, says that ‘every page breathes of\r\nClan-Alpine freshness.’\r\n\r\nGreat stress is laid upon the home-printing of the small journals—‘no\r\npatent outside or inside;’ ‘almost every sentence is of home\r\nmanufacture, little clipping is done;’ ‘the only paper that does\r\nall its work at home,’ &c. A further noticeable feature is the\r\nfrequent use of certificates and testimonials as to circulation from\r\npublic and private individuals or from contemporary prints, or of\r\nself-recommendations such as that of the paper which ‘has a very fine\r\nlist of country subscribers,’ or of the journal ‘published by a genuine\r\nJayhawker,’ which ‘goes to every post-office in the northern part of\r\nthe State.’\r\n\r\nIt is when we come to the direct announcements to advertisers,\r\nhowever, that we get perhaps the queerest hints from our American\r\ncousins. ‘Advertising rates cheerfully furnished’ appears frequently;\r\n‘Advertisers love it’ is a short and sweet statement regarding one\r\npaper; ‘Should be patronised by every live advertiser;’ ‘Advertisers,\r\ndo you want some return for your money? Read our inducements,’\r\nsay others. Then, ‘The modesty of the publishers deters them from\r\nmentioning the peculiar merits of the _Courier_ as an advertising\r\nmedium’—a modesty rivalled by the remark, ‘Rates of advertising so\r\nlow that we are almost ashamed to announce them,’ which differs from\r\nthe standpoint of a third, ‘Advertising rates held high enough to\r\nmake a living for the publisher;’ and the latter appears upon the\r\nwhole to be the more general sentiment, as may be testified by ‘Don’t\r\nsend offers under price,’ ‘We only advertise _for money_.’ The last\r\nsentence alludes to a species of exchange evidently less popular among\r\nthe publishers than with their clients. ‘No advertising solicited,’\r\nsays the _Westfield Pantograph_, ‘except for cash, or what may be as\r\ngood. No space to give away or let at half-price.’ More decisive is the\r\n_Calhoun Pilot_, which ‘is choice in the admission of advertisements\r\nin its columns, and those it does admit, “due bills” of no character\r\nwill settle for them. Must be in hard cash quarterly in advance, unless\r\ngood references are given. Save your paper and postage, ye advertisers\r\nwho have nothing to offer us for our space than your wares and due\r\nbills. We don’t want ’em. We have a good article to retail, and nothing\r\nbut the almighty dollar will buy it. But,’ adds the _Pilot_ more\r\namiably, ‘while this is strictly our rule, our rates are low, and we\r\ngive value received for all the lucre you place in our possession.’\r\nStill more downright is the declaration, ‘No three-cornered patent\r\npills, second-hand clothing, skunk-hunting machines, or hand-organs\r\ntaken in payment for advertising.’ ‘The _News_ publishes no dead\r\nads., and gives no puffs;’ ‘No half-cash advertisements accepted, no\r\nswindling or bogus patrons wanted.’ ‘Dead-beat, swindling advertisers,’\r\nsarcastically announces the _Troy Free Press_, ‘can have their matter\r\nchucked carefully into the stove by sending them to our office. Our\r\nspace is for sale, and must be paid for at living rates.’ But there\r\nis encouragement for honest advertisers given by a _Clipper-Herald_\r\nthrough whose columns announcements ‘go to that class of people who\r\nare honest and intelligent and who pay for what they get;’ and in an\r\nequally straightforward assertion elsewhere, the _mens conscia recti_\r\nof the editor rises superior to grammar into the realms of wit: ‘Has a\r\ngood circulation among a prompt-paying class of people—these be facts!’\r\n\r\nFacts or not, there is a distinctive character about Jonathan’s\r\nadvertisements equal to some of the fiction with which he has supplied\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING CLUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.—THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT.\r\n\r\nDown-stairs in the public room, the faithful Derrick is engaged in a\r\nseemingly interesting conversation with mine host Hobb Dipping and two\r\nor three other jolly good fellows, who are all drinking at his expense.\r\nNo sign yet had the attendant discovered that had served to arouse his\r\nsuspicions. No word had been spoken which in any way showed that the\r\nnatives of this desolate place were anxious to know more about his\r\nmaster or himself. A suspicion of danger often arouses our fears and\r\ndoubts when there is perhaps the smallest occasion for either. The\r\nhonest countrymen troubled themselves much less about the matter than\r\neven the worthy host, who was happily indifferent to everything but the\r\nfact that Mr Morton and his servant were rare and profitable customers.\r\nThe lumbering knot of labourers at length departs, and mine host locks\r\nand bars the door; while Derrick, not a little fatigued with the\r\nharassing events of the day, is left standing alone, surveying a row of\r\nempty benches which the retiring fenmen have just quitted. Burly Hobb\r\ncomes back puffing and blowing, his red face glowing like the setting\r\nsun, and his bald skull spotted with perspiration through the exertion\r\nhe has undergone in securing the strongly built outer door.\r\n\r\n‘Landlord, I’m going to bed,’ says Derrick, who has suddenly returned\r\nto his original gruffness.\r\n\r\n‘Very good, sir,’ is the reply of the host, who forthwith trims and\r\nlights an atom of a lamp which he fishes out of a cupboard by the\r\nfireplace. ‘I hope you will sleep well, sir.’\r\n\r\nDerrick’s eyes are watching the innkeeper from under his beetling\r\nbrows, and he answers gruffly: ‘I hope so.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ve heard it said,’ goes on the loquacious host, ‘that a good sleep\r\nis worth a fortune to an over-tired man. I see nothing to prevent you\r\nsleeping well here, sir.’\r\n\r\n‘Not much likelihood of being roused in the night, eh?’ remarks the\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n‘Why, no, sir,’ answers Dipping, wondering what motive his guest could\r\nhave in asking such a question. ‘There’s no one to disturb you here,\r\nunless, indeed, it be your master himself.’\r\n\r\n‘Many visitors here?’ inquired Derrick, as old Hobb leads the way up\r\nthe dusky, creaking staircase with the flickering lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n‘None at all, sir,’ replied the landlord in a melancholy tone. ‘There\r\nnever is any one here—leastways, very, very seldom. I haven’t had a\r\nvisitor stopping in this house for a matter of—I can’t rightly say\r\nhow long; but I know it’s a mortal long while, for since my poor wife\r\ndied’——\r\n\r\n‘Is this my room?’ interrupts Derrick, as the innkeeper halts before a\r\nsolid-looking black door at the head of the staircase.\r\n\r\n‘It is,’ answers old Dipping. ‘You are pretty close to your master,\r\nsir.’\r\n\r\n‘I know,’ is all that the attendant deigns to say, as he pushes open\r\nthe door and enters with the light, leaving the landlord to stumble\r\ndown-stairs in the dark as best he may. Having carefully fastened the\r\ndoor, Derrick sets down the light, and approaches the window with the\r\nintention of getting a breath of fresh air. The casement is somewhat\r\nhard to unfasten, and when at length he succeeds in opening it, the\r\nlamp which he has brought is blown out under the sudden influence of\r\na gust of air which is admitted. No matter; he does not want it. The\r\nnight-breeze is cool and refreshing, a favourable contrast to the hot\r\nstifling room below, and Derrick, as he leans upon the window-ledge,\r\nbegins to appear more contented and at ease. All afterglow of the\r\ntwilight has long disappeared, and the moon is shining with a sickly\r\nlight upon a low layer of mist which covers the marshy flats. Above\r\nthe thin watery fog which has arisen from the sluggish stream and\r\nenshrouded the village as in a winding-sheet, the great shattered\r\ntower of the monastery rises ghostlike and dim, while the silence of\r\nthe vast solitude is unbroken by a single sound. Even Derrick is not\r\ninsensible to the peculiar beauty and stillness of the scene, and he\r\nlounges there, humming a tune, and watching the silvery trickle upon\r\nthe watery marsh long after mine host has retired to rest. At length he\r\ncloses the casement and divests himself of his heavy boots. Tired as\r\nhe is, he does not attempt to remove his clothes. The man had seen a\r\ndeal of sharp service, and experience had taught him long ago that in\r\ncases where he might be wanted at any moment, it were better to sleep\r\nin them. He merely places his pistols within reach, and then throwing\r\nhimself upon the bed, endeavours to sleep.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows what it is to arrive at that dreamy state of\r\nsemi-unconsciousness when the weary senses, failing at once to engage\r\nthe attentions of the drowsy god, find a sort of relief in a long train\r\nof most disconnected thought. It was thus with Derrick. The fatigues\r\nof the day had proved too much for even that hardy individual, so\r\nthat, instead of falling at once into a sound refreshing sleep, he\r\nwas drowsily conning over the different events which had occurred,\r\nhis rambling imagination colouring them with a variety of indistinct\r\npictures and incidents. These weird fancies at length grew fainter\r\nand fainter, and the attendant was fast sinking into slumber, when\r\nsuddenly, and as it seemed without a cause, he awoke. Through the\r\ncasement the moon was staring down upon him like a pale still face,\r\nand the greater part of his recumbent person lay bathed in its cold\r\nlight. All was still; there seemed not the slightest reason why he\r\nshould be thus aroused. The silence was profound, and the very beating\r\nof Derrick’s heart sounded like a hammer thumping time in his head.\r\nScarcely knowing what he does, he sits up on the edge of his bed and\r\nlistens. Yes; he was not mistaken, there seemed to be a faint noise\r\napproaching the old inn—a low measured tramp. The hammer-like beating\r\ngrows louder as Derrick, with every nerve strained to the utmost\r\npitch, silently rises and once more opens the casement. There can be\r\nno mistake now; some persons are approaching; and in that low tramp,\r\ndistant as it is, he recognises the marching of a body of soldiers.\r\nHe closes the window softly, and taking his heavy riding-boots in his\r\nhand, unfastens the door, and glides softly along the gallery towards\r\nhis master’s apartment. Owing to the pitchy darkness in which the\r\ngallery is enveloped, he experiences some difficulty in groping his\r\nway without stumbling; but reaching the further end at last, he feels\r\nhis way to his master’s door and gives the required signal. It is\r\nanswered with unexpected suddenness, the door being instantly thrown\r\nopen, and Sir Carnaby appearing on the threshold. He is fully dressed,\r\nlike Derrick; he has not even removed his outer clothing, and in his\r\nhand is a short broad-bladed knife. The saddle-bags lie upon the table,\r\nand a portion of their contents, discernible by a dim night-light, is\r\nscattered about; but the black box is gone.\r\n\r\nIn a very few words, the trusty henchman explains what is the reason\r\nof his coming, and urges his master to hold himself in readiness to\r\nescape, should it be necessary. Sir Carnaby looks at him while he\r\nspeaks as if he does not quite understand his hurried explanation;\r\nbut when the attendant has finished, he looks around the room with an\r\nanxious air, and then says: ‘If it be so, Derrick, we must get off\r\nsomehow as quickly as we can. This window, I think, looks towards the\r\nback of the house. Can you not manage to descend into the courtyard and\r\nget out our horses? Lead them down the bank of the stream towards that\r\ntall beacon by the dike. You must remember the place; we remarked it as\r\nwe passed the mill on our journey here.’\r\n\r\n‘I remember the place, Sir Carnaby; but I am not going to make off\r\nthere, and leave you alone here.’\r\n\r\n‘I shall be safe enough, I tell you, Derrick,’ said the baronet as he\r\nhastily motioned to the attendant to go. ‘I cannot come yet; I cannot;\r\nit is impossible.’\r\n\r\n‘I will wait below, then,’ is the stubborn reply of his servant, who is\r\nalready half out of the window.\r\n\r\n‘Derrick,’ says Sir Carnaby, laying his hand upon the attendant’s\r\nshoulder, ‘do what I tell you. I cannot come now; and if you wait below\r\nfor me, as you say, we shall both be discovered. More lives than our\r\nown depend upon your obeying me at this moment. Go, as I tell you, and\r\nwait for me by the beacon; and I will join you as soon as I possibly\r\ncan.’\r\n\r\nThe man clasps his master’s hand, and, with something like tears in\r\nhis eyes, makes his way to the ground. The fugitive baronet has no\r\nemotion expressed on his countenance, for he fears not for himself; his\r\nthoughts are centred upon that black box which has now so strangely\r\ndisappeared. With the broad-bladed knife still in his hand, he goes\r\ntowards a corner of the room, kneels down, and appears to busy himself\r\nwith the planking of the floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFortunately for himself, Derrick had found his way to the shed where\r\nthe horses had been stabled; and his efforts to saddle and bring them\r\nout had proved successful. The great gates leading out of the courtyard\r\nof the old inn were fastened; but this did not deter the attendant’s\r\nmovements for an instant. Leading the horses through a gap in the fence\r\nat the back of the _Saxonford Arms_, he crossed a small cultivated\r\ninclosure, and emerged from the cover of a hedge upon the open highway.\r\nStopping for a moment to listen, he plainly distinguished the measured\r\ntramp of soldiers approaching the inn, mingled with the low peculiar\r\nclank of arms and accoutrements. One circumstance which particularly\r\nalarmed Derrick was that the sound plainly came from the direction\r\nin which he had to go. There was no time for thought, however; the\r\nwarning tramp which broke the stillness of the night came nearer and\r\nnearer, and over the old timber bridge which crossed the stream came\r\na dim file of figures—eleven of them. Derrick could easily count the\r\nnumber as they passed over the bridge and came straight towards the old\r\n_Saxonford Arms_, their fixed bayonets flashing and glittering in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nThere was but one course he could take; he must move forward and pass\r\nthem. No opportunity for making a detour, for the military were not\r\none hundred yards from the house, and the attendant knew that he had\r\nbeen seen. Muttering a prayer for his master’s safety, Derrick put the\r\nhorses to a slow trot, and advanced towards the soldiers with a feeling\r\nof fear at his heart which he had never before experienced. He had not\r\ncovered half the distance before a sharp word of command came from the\r\nfront, and a line was drawn up across the road, evidently with the\r\nintention of disputing his further progress. A dash for it now; delay\r\nmeant capture both for himself and his master. Digging spurs into his\r\nhorse’s sides, the attendant laid the flat of his broad blade over the\r\nflanks of Sir Carnaby’s charger which he led, and tore down the road\r\nlike a whirlwind. It was all over in a minute. A sheet of flame shot\r\nforth as the bold horseman broke through the line, and then, without\r\na check, he found himself ascending the steep bank close against the\r\nbridge. The soldiers, however, who had taken the initiative, had\r\nno intention of letting their suspected quarry escape. Before Sir\r\nCarnaby’s servant could head the bank, he was surrounded, and a hoarse\r\ncry to stop and surrender came from his pursuers. In this they had\r\nmistaken their man. Derrick entertained no such idea. He indeed hoped\r\nthat the firing would alarm his master, and allow him time to make his\r\nretreat in safety; but not a thought had he of yielding. Once more\r\nclapping spurs to his horse, and striking right and left with his drawn\r\nblade, the attendant partially succeeded in clearing himself from the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, a random shot from one of the military dropped his\r\nmaster’s horse, which he had been leading. Derrick had scarcely time to\r\ndisengage his arm from the bridle before the poor animal went crashing\r\ndown, breaking the worm-eaten railing of the bridge like matchwood, and\r\nthrowing one of his assailants headlong into the stream below. In the\r\nconfusion, Derrick received a bayonet-wound in the left arm, and he was\r\nnearly pulled from his saddle; but shaking himself free with almost\r\nsuperhuman strength, he applied his spurs, and galloped across the old\r\nbridge for dear life.\r\n\r\nAlthough there appeared to be no attempt at pursuit, Derrick did not\r\njudge it prudent to ride straight for the spot where he hoped to meet\r\nhis master. After making a considerable circuit, the trusty henchman,\r\nfaithful to the last, reined in his reeking steed, and gazed across the\r\nflat misty space in the direction of the _Saxonford Arms_. The silence,\r\nhowever, was as complete as when he had sat at that open window looking\r\nover the fen. Not a soul was anywhere near him. Putting his horse once\r\nmore in motion, the man rode slowly along the bank until he reached\r\nthe place of rendezvous. It was as he both feared and suspected. Sir\r\nCarnaby was not there. He must wait. The clear night clouded, and the\r\nhours passed by, but yet his master came not. Derrick might wait until\r\nthe crack of doom, but he never would meet his master again on earth.\r\nThe devoted courage of the servant was useless now, for, pierced by a\r\nmusket bullet, Sir Carnaby Vincent lay lifeless across the stairs of\r\nthe old _Saxonford Arms_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.—AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS.\r\n\r\nIt wanted but a few days to Christmas 1760—a seasonable Christmas,\r\nand in keeping with that festive season of the year. Snow and sharp\r\nnorth-east winds had been plentiful for nearly a week past. The flat\r\ncountry all around the time-honoured cathedral city of Fridswold had\r\nbeen covered with a vast sheet of drifted snow, which had found its\r\nway into every nook and crevice, filling up all the ditches and dikes\r\nuntil they were level with the surrounding country. The minster tower\r\nwas embellished with an innumerable number of white patches, and the\r\nminster roofs were hidden under a thick covering of frozen snow. It was\r\nevident that King Christmas had things to his liking this time, and\r\nwas bent upon enjoying his own particular time in his own particular\r\nway. Meanwhile the wind roared on, roared and whistled, and whisked\r\nthe sharp frozen snowflakes round and round, dashing them, as if in\r\nimpotent rage, against the sturdy walls of the minster. The air was so\r\nthick that, although the hour was not late, darkness had set in with\r\na density that obscured every object from view, while the tolling of\r\nthe great vespers-bell was drowned by the distracting uproar of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIt was during one of the uncertain lulls which occurred from time to\r\ntime, that a figure emerged from the protecting shelter of one of the\r\ncathedral buttresses, and wrapping himself in the folds of a horseman’s\r\ncloak, strode hastily forward, evidently intending to take advantage\r\nof the brief calm and reach some haven of shelter. Scarcely a single\r\nperson was to be seen in the deserted streets, through which the blast\r\ntore with such mad fury that the buffeted wayfarer staggered again.\r\nVisions of glowing fires, dry clothes, and comfortable shelter rose\r\nbefore his imagination as he passed a brightly lighted window. But\r\nthere was no stopping for him; he must on and fight this tough battle\r\nwith the pitiless wind as best he may. His destination is at length\r\nreached. The weather-beaten traveller descends a couple of steps,\r\npasses through an open doorway, and emerges from the outer darkness\r\ninto a warm, cosy-looking bar—his clothes half-frozen, and crusted\r\nwith patches of snow. He is apparently known here, for he is instantly\r\nrelieved of his cloak and hat by a neat-looking damsel, who up to the\r\npresent moment has been engaged in a light and refreshing flirtation\r\nwith a large, hot-visaged man lounging before the fire.\r\n\r\n‘Sharp weather this, sir,’ remarked that worthy, slightly moving from\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\n‘Sharp indeed!’ returned the other in a deep voice, as he shook some\r\nloose particles of snow from his person.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, this’ll be a bad time for many people,’ was the next remark the\r\nlarge man ventured upon.\r\n\r\nA muttered exclamation dropped from the lips of the last comer, but was\r\ntoo indistinct to be heard.\r\n\r\n‘There’ll be many a person remember this night,’ continued he of the\r\nfiery countenance, with an insane notion that he was getting along\r\ncapitally.\r\n\r\nThe individual addressed turned sharply round, fixing a pair of dark\r\neyes upon the other’s face, but he did not speak.\r\n\r\nSomewhat discouraged, the large man paused for a minute ere he spoke\r\nagain. The person he seemed so wishful to converse with was a tall,\r\nhandsome, young fellow, dressed in a sort of half-military costume, and\r\nwith a bold dashing look, sufficient in itself to attract notice. By\r\nhis side was a silver-hilted rapier, the ordinary weapon of a gentleman\r\nof the day; and the martial look of the wearer was sufficient proof\r\nthat he would be prompt to use it in any emergency. Seemingly not\r\nsatisfied with the long inspection he had thought fit to take, our\r\nred-faced friend once more endeavoured to enter into conversation; but\r\nthe gentleman, after giving the maid some orders, quitted the room.\r\n\r\n‘Is that gentleman staying in the house, Peggy, my dear?’ asked the\r\nred-faced one of the waiting-maid.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; he came here last night,’ replied the girl, who was perfectly\r\nready to resume the aforesaid flirtation, which had been interrupted by\r\nthe entrance of the visitor.\r\n\r\nBut the man with the fiery face now seemed to be persistently\r\ninterested in the stranger. ‘What may his name be, Peg?’ he asked in a\r\ntone of affected carelessness.\r\n\r\n‘That’s no business of yours, Mr Goff,’ retorted the damsel a trifle\r\ntartly, for the swain’s indifference somewhat nettled her.\r\n\r\n‘Now, Peggy, my chuck, don’t get crusty,’ said the big man in wheedling\r\naccents. ‘What’s that you’ve got in your pretty hand?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s the gentleman’s hat,’ replied the fair maid, somewhat relaxing.\r\n‘I’m going to dry it by the fire with his cloak. They’re sopping wet,\r\nnow the snow’s melted on them.’\r\n\r\n‘He’s not likely to lose his headpiece, whoever he may be,’ remarked\r\nMr Goff. ‘I can see “R. Ainslie” on the lining quite plain, as you’re\r\nholding it now.’\r\n\r\n‘You seem to take a deal of interest in the gentleman,’ laughed Peggy\r\nas she turned the hat away.\r\n\r\n‘It’s mighty little interest I take in any one except you, my beauty,’\r\nreturned Mr Goff. ‘I only thought the young fellow looked wonderful\r\nweary and tired like.’\r\n\r\n‘He looked that yesterday,’ said Peggy, warming to the subject. ‘I felt\r\nquite sorry for him when he rode up. It wasn’t fit weather to turn a\r\ndog out in.’\r\n\r\n‘And he’s been out again to-day?’ hazarded the big man.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ replied Peggy, depositing the hat and cloak in front of the\r\nroaring blaze. ‘He went out early on foot, leaving his horse in the\r\nstable, and we saw nothing more of him till two o’clock. He came back\r\nthen, and ordered something to eat; but, as I’m a living creature, I\r\nthink he scarcely touched it. After that, he went out again, and did\r\nnot return till just now.’\r\n\r\n‘It seems wonderful curious,’ said Mr Goff slowly, as he buttoned up\r\nhis coat and prepared to go—‘seems wonderful curious that a young gent\r\nshould go on in that fashion. When I see ’em a-doing so, I always have\r\na sort of notion that they’ve got something on their minds, and are\r\ngoing to act rash.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s your experience, is it?’ said the girl with a laugh. ‘I don’t\r\nthink much of it.’\r\n\r\n‘Possibly not,’ returned the other. ‘Good-night.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLITARY ISLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government of Iceland have commissioned Mr Thoroddsen to undertake\r\nsystematic explorations of that island, with a view to investigating\r\nits physical features and describing its natural history. While on a\r\nvisit to Grimsey, a small island twenty-two miles due north of Iceland,\r\nhe found it inhabited by eighty-eight human beings, debarred from all\r\ncommunication with the mainland, excepting once or twice every year,\r\nwhen, at great risk, the natives contrived to visit the mainland in\r\ntheir small open boats.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the flora and meteorology of this secluded islet,\r\nMr Thoroddsen informs us that the ‘pastor of the island, M. Pjetur\r\nGudmundsson, has for many years been engaged in exceedingly careful\r\nmeteorological observations on behalf of the Meteorological Institute\r\nof Copenhagen. This most worthy gentleman, living here in conspicuous\r\npoverty, like a hermit divorced from the world, though he has the\r\ncomfort of a good wife to be thankful for, is not only regarded as\r\na father by his primitive congregation, but enjoys, moreover, the\r\nreputation of being in the front rank among sacred poets in modern\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\n‘The inhabitants derive their livelihood for the most part from\r\nbird-catching, nest-robbing, and deep-sea fisheries. The precipices\r\nthat form the eastern face of the island are crowded with myriads of\r\nvarious kinds of sea-fowl. On every ledge the birds are seen thickly\r\npacked together; the rocks are white with guano, or green-tufted with\r\nscurvy-grass; here everything is in ceaseless movement, stir, and\r\nflutter, accompanied by a myriad-voiced concert from screamers on the\r\nwing, from chatterers on domestic affairs in the rock-ledges, and\r\nfrom brawlers at the parliament of love out at sea, the surface of\r\nwhich beneath the rocks is literally thatched at this time of the year\r\nwith the wooing multitudes of this happy commonwealth. If the peace\r\nis broken by a stone rolled over the precipice or by the report of\r\na gunshot, the air is suddenly darkened by the rising clouds of the\r\ndisturbed birds, which, viewed from the rocks, resemble what might be\r\ntaken for gigantic swarms of bees or midges.\r\n\r\n‘The method adopted for collecting eggs is the following: Provided with\r\na strong rope, some nine or ten stalwart men go to the precipice, where\r\nit is some three hundred feet high, and one of the number volunteers\r\nor is singled out by the rest for the perilous _sig_, that is, “sink”\r\nor “drop,” over the edge of the rocks. Round his thighs and waist,\r\nthickly padded generally with bags stuffed with feathers or hay, the\r\n_sigamadr_, “sinkman” or “dropman,” adjusts the rope in such a manner\r\nthat he may hang, when dropped, in a sitting posture. He is also\r\ndressed in a wide smock or sack of coarse calico, open at the breast,\r\nand tied round the waist with a belt, into the ample folds of which\r\nhe slips the eggs he gathers, the capacity of the smock affording\r\naccommodation to from one hundred to one hundred and fifty eggs at a\r\ntime. In one hand the sinkman holds a pole, sixteen feet long, with a\r\nladle tied to one end, and by this means scoops the eggs out of nests\r\nwhich are beyond the reach of his own hands. When the purpose of this\r\n“breath-fetching” sink is accomplished, on a given sign the dropman is\r\nhauled up again by his comrades. This, as may readily be imagined, is\r\na most dangerous undertaking, and many a life has been lost over it in\r\nGrimsey from accidents occurring to the rope.\r\n\r\n‘For the pursuit of the fishery, the island possesses fourteen small\r\nopen boats, in which the men will venture out as far as four to six\r\nmiles cod-fishing; but this is a most hazardous industry, owing both\r\nto the sudden manner in which the sea will rise, sometimes even a\r\nlong time in advance of travelling storms, and to the difficulty of\r\neffecting a landing on the harbourless island.\r\n\r\n‘Now and then the monotony of the life of the inhabitants is broken by\r\nvisits from foreigners, mostly Icelandic shark-fishers, or English or\r\nFrench fishermen.\r\n\r\n‘Of domestic animals the islanders now possess only a few sheep.\r\nFormerly there were five cows in the island; but the hard winter\r\nof 1860 necessitated their extermination, and since that time, for\r\ntwenty-four years, the people have had to do without a cow! Of horses\r\nthere are only two at present (1884) in the island! Strange to say, the\r\nhealth of the people seems on the whole to bear a fair comparison with\r\nmore favoured localities. Scurvy, which formerly was very prevalent,\r\nhas now almost disappeared, as has also a disease peculiar to children,\r\nwhich, in the form of spasm or convulsive fit, used to be very fatal to\r\ninfant life in former years.\r\n\r\n‘Inexpressibly solitary must be the life of these people in winter,\r\nshut out from all communication with the outer world, and having\r\nin view, as far as the eye can reach, nothing but arctic ice. The\r\nexistence of generation after generation here seems to be spent in\r\none continuous and unavailing arctic expedition. The only diversion\r\nafforded by nature consists in the shifting colours of the flickering\r\naurora borealis, in the twinkling of the stars in the heavens, and\r\nthe fantastic forms of wandering icebergs. No wonder that such\r\nsurroundings should serve to produce a quiet, serious, devout, and\r\ndown-hearted race, in which respect the Grimsey men may perhaps be\r\nsaid to constitute a typical group among their compatriots. However,\r\nto dispel the heavy tedium of the long winter days, they seek their\r\namusements in the reading of the Sagas, in chess-playing, and in such\r\nmild dissipations at mutual entertainments at Christmas-time as their\r\nsplendid poverty will allow.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTRY AND FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one of the evening lectures in connection with the late Edinburgh\r\nForestry Exhibition, Mr J. Meldrum spoke of the ‘Johore Forests’ which\r\nare situated in the Malayan Peninsula between the British settlements\r\nof Singapore and Malacca. The greater part of the interior, he said,\r\nconsisted of a virgin forest, and abounded in timber trees of a large\r\nsize, no fewer than three hundred and fifty specimens of which were to\r\nbe seen in the Forestry Exhibition. About three hundred kinds awaited\r\nthe advent of the papermaker, who would be able to convert them into\r\nuseful wood-pulp at a very low cost. Railways were required to make\r\nthis wealth of timber available for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother lecture by Mr Cracknell at the model of the Manitoba Farm\r\nembodied some interesting information regarding the Canadian\r\nnorth-west. The Bell Farm in Qu’appelle he described as the largest\r\nfarm in the world. There were eight thousand acres under crop, five\r\nthousand under wheat, and a portion of the remainder under flax. From\r\nthis farm, ten thousand bushels of wheat had been exported at a good\r\nprice last year; and this year’s crop was estimated to be forty per\r\ncent. better. The estimated wheat acreage this year in Manitoba is\r\nthree hundred and fifty thousand; and in the north-west territories\r\nsixty-five thousand, with an estimated yield of twenty-three bushels\r\nan acre. There was thus a total of four hundred and fifteen thousand\r\nacres, and nine million five hundred and forty-five thousand bushels;\r\nbut deducting two million seven hundred and sixty thousand bushels for\r\nhome consumption and seed, there remained a surplus of six million\r\nseven hundred and eighty-five thousand bushels. There is little\r\nconsolation here for the British farmer, who finds wheat-growing at the\r\npresent low prices positively unremunerative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOVE-THOUGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If thou wert only, love, a tiny flower,\r\n      And I a butterfly with gaudy wings,\r\n    Flitting to changing scenes each changing hour,\r\n      Careless of aught save that which pleasure brings—\r\n    Not even I could leave the lowliest glade\r\n    That held thy loveliness within its shade.\r\n\r\n    If thou wert but a streamlet in the vale,\r\n      And I a sailor on a stormy sea,\r\n    Flying through whirling foam beneath the gale,\r\n      Chartless in all that wild immensity—\r\n    Thy murmuring voice would echo in my soul\r\n    Through howling storm or crashing thunder-roll.\r\n\r\n    If, darling, thou wert but a far-off star,\r\n      And I a weary wanderer o’er the plain,\r\n    Unwitting of celestial worlds afar,\r\n      And knowing naught of all the shining train—\r\n    My glance would single out thy ray serene,\r\n    Though blazing suns and planets rolled between.\r\n\r\n    Yet, dear one, thou art these to me, and more:\r\n      My flower, whose radiance passeth all decay;\r\n    My streamlet of sweet thoughts in endless store;\r\n      My star, to guide my steps to perfect day;\r\n    My hope in earth’s dark dungeon of despair;\r\n    My refuge ’mid life’s weary noonday glare.\r\n\r\n            H.
