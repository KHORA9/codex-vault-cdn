On the north, they are\r\nseparated by the Sierra Mariara from the sea-coast; and towards the\r\nsouth, the chain of Guacimo and Yusma serves them as a rampart against\r\nthe heated air of the steppes. Groups of hills, high enough to\r\ndetermine the course of the waters, close this basin on the east and\r\nwest like transverse dykes. We find these hills between the Tuy and La\r\nVictoria, as well as on the road from Valencia to Nirgua, and at the\r\nmountains of Torito.* (* The lofty mountains of Los Teques, where the\r\nTuy takes its source, may be looked upon as the eastern boundary of\r\nthe valleys of Aragua. The level of the ground continues, in fact, to\r\nrise from La Victoria to the Hacienda de Tuy; but the river Tuy,\r\nturning southward in the direction of the sierras of Guairaima and\r\nTiara has found an issue on the east; and it is more natural to\r\nconsider as the limits of the basin of Aragua a line drawn through the\r\nsources of the streams flowing into the lake of Valencia. The charts\r\nand sections I have traced of the road from Caracas to Nueva Valencia,\r\nand from Porto Cabello to Villa de Cura, exhibit the whole of these\r\ngeological relations.) From this extraordinary configuration of the\r\nland, the little rivers of the valleys of Aragua form a peculiar\r\nsystem, and direct their course towards a basin closed on all sides.\r\nThese rivers do not bear their waters to the ocean; they are collected\r\nin a lake; and subject to the peculiar influence of evaporation, they\r\nlose themselves, if we may use the expression, in the atmosphere. On\r\nthe existence of rivers and lakes, the fertility of the soil and the\r\nproduce of cultivation in these valleys depend. The aspect of the\r\nspot, and the experience of half a century, have proved that the level\r\nof the waters is not invariable; the waste by evaporation, and the\r\nincrease from the waters running into the lake, do not uninterruptedly\r\nbalance each other. The lake being elevated one thousand feet above\r\nthe neighbouring steppes of Calabozo, and one thousand three hundred\r\nand thirty-two feet above the level of the ocean, it has been\r\nsuspected that there are subterranean communications and filtrations.\r\nThe appearance of new islands, and the gradual retreat of the waters,\r\nhave led to the belief that the lake may perhaps, in time, become\r\nentirely dry. An assemblage of physical circumstances so remarkable\r\nwas well fitted to fix my attention on those valleys where the wild\r\nbeauty of nature is embellished by agricultural industry, and the arts\r\nof rising civilization.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Valencia, called Tacarigua by the Indians, exceeds in\r\nmagnitude the lake of Neufchatel in Switzerland; but its general form\r\nhas more resemblance to the lake of Geneva, which is nearly at the\r\nsame height above the level of the sea. As the slope of the ground in\r\nthe valleys of Aragua tends towards the south and the west, that part\r\nof the basin still covered with water is the nearest to the southern\r\nchain of the mountains of Guigue, of Yusma, and of Guacimo, which\r\nstretch towards the high savannahs of Ocumare. The opposite banks of\r\nthe lake of Valencia display a singular contrast; those on the south\r\nare desert, and almost uninhabited, and a screen of high mountains\r\ngives them a gloomy and monotonous aspect. The northern shore on the\r\ncontrary, is cheerful, pastoral, and decked with the rich cultivation\r\nof the sugar-cane, coffee-tree, and cotton. Paths bordered with\r\ncestrums, azedaracs, and other shrubs always in flower, cross the\r\nplain, and join the scattered farms. Every house is surrounded by\r\nclumps of trees. The ceiba with its large yellow flowers* (* Carnes\r\ntollendas, Bombax hibiscifolius.) gives a peculiar character to the\r\nlandscape, mingling its branches with those of the purple erythrina.\r\nThis mixture of vivid vegetable colours contrasts finely with the\r\nuniform tint of an unclouded sky. In the season of drought, where the\r\nburning soil is covered with an undulating vapour, artificial\r\nirrigations preserve verdure and promote fertility. Here and there the\r\ngranite rock pierces through the cultivated ground. Enormous stony\r\nmasses rise abruptly in the midst of the valley. Bare and forked, they\r\nnourish a few succulent plants, which prepare mould for future ages.\r\nOften on the summit of these lonely hills may be seen a fig-tree or a\r\nclusia with fleshy leaves, which has fixed its roots in the rock, and\r\ntowers over the landscape. With their dead and withered branches,\r\nthese trees look like signals erected on a steep cliff. The form of\r\nthese mounts unfolds the secret of their ancient origin; for when the\r\nwhole of this valley was filled with water, and the waves beat at the\r\nfoot of the peaks of Mariara (the Devil's Nook* (* El Rincon del\r\nDiablo.)) and the chain of the coast, these rocky hills were shoals or\r\nislets.\r\n\r\nThese features of a rich landscape, these contrasts between the two\r\nbanks of the lake of Valencia, often reminded me of the Pays de Vaud,\r\nwhere the soil, everywhere cultivated, and everywhere fertile, offers\r\nthe husbandman, the shepherd, and the vine-dresser, the secure fruit\r\nof their labours, while, on the opposite side, Chablais presents only\r\na mountainous and half-desert country. In these distant climes\r\nsurrounded by exotic productions, I loved to recall to mind the\r\nenchanting descriptions with which the aspect of the Leman lake and\r\nthe rocks of La Meillerie inspired a great writer. Now, while in the\r\ncentre of civilized Europe, I endeavour in my turn to paint the scenes\r\nof the New World, I do not imagine I present the reader with clearer\r\nimages, or more precise ideas, by comparing our landscapes with those\r\nof the equinoctial regions. It cannot be too often repeated that\r\nnature, in every zone, whether wild or cultivated, smiling or\r\nmajestic, has an individual character. The impressions which she\r\nexcites are infinitely varied, like the emotions produced by works of\r\ngenius, according to the age in which they were conceived, and the\r\ndiversity of language from which they in part derive their charm. We\r\nmust limit our comparisons merely to dimensions and external form. We\r\nmay institute a parallel between the colossal summit of Mont Blanc and\r\nthe Himalaya Mountains; the cascades of the Pyrenees and those of the\r\nCordilleras: but these comparisons, useful with respect to science,\r\nfail to convey an idea of the characteristics of nature in the\r\ntemperate and torrid zones. On the banks of a lake, in a vast forest,\r\nat the foot of summits covered with eternal snow, it is not the mere\r\nmagnitude of the objects which excites our admiration. That which\r\nspeaks to the soul, which causes such profound and varied emotions,\r\nescapes our measurements as it does the forms of language. Those who\r\nfeel powerfully the charms of nature cannot venture on comparing one\r\nwith another, scenes totally different in character.\r\n\r\nBut it is not alone the picturesque beauties of the lake of Valencia\r\nthat have given celebrity to its banks. This basin presents several\r\nother phenomena, and suggests questions, the solution of which is\r\ninteresting alike to physical science and to the well-being of the\r\ninhabitants. What are the causes of the diminution of the waters of\r\nthe lake? Is this diminution more rapid now than in former ages? Can\r\nwe presume that an equilibrium between the waters flowing in and the\r\nwaters lost will be shortly re-established, or may we apprehend that\r\nthe lake will entirely disappear?\r\n\r\nAccording to astronomical observations made at La Victoria, Hacienda\r\nde Cura, Nueva Valencia, and Guigue, the length of the lake in its\r\npresent state from Cagua to Guayos, is ten leagues, or twenty-eight\r\nthousand eight hundred toises. Its breadth is very unequal. If we\r\njudge from the latitudes of the mouth of the Rio Cura and the village\r\nof Guigue, it nowhere surpasses 2.3 leagues, or six thousand five\r\nhundred toises; most commonly it is but four or five miles. The\r\ndimensions, as deduced from my observations are much less than those\r\nhitherto adopted by the natives. It might be thought that, to form a\r\nprecise idea of the progressive diminution of the waters, it would be\r\nsufficient to compare the present dimensions of the lake with those\r\nattributed to it by ancient chroniclers; by Oviedo for instance, in\r\nhis History of the Province of Venezuela, published about the year\r\n1723. This writer in his emphatic style, assigns to \"this inland sea,\r\nthis monstruoso cuerpo de la laguna de Valencia\"* (* \"Enormous body of\r\nthe lake of Valencia.\"), fourteen leagues in length and six in\r\nbreadth. He affirms that at a small distance from the shore the lead\r\nfinds no bottom; and that large floating islands cover the surface of\r\nthe waters, which are constantly agitated by the winds. No importance\r\ncan be attached to estimates which, without being founded on any\r\nmeasurement, are expressed in leagues (leguas) reckoned in the\r\ncolonies at three thousand, five thousand, and six thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty varas.* (* Seamen being the first, and for a long\r\ntime the only, persons who introduced into the Spanish colonies any\r\nprecise ideas on the astronomical position and distances of places,\r\nthe legua nautica of 6650 varas, or of 2854 toises (20 in a degree),\r\nwas originally used in Mexico and throughout South America; but this\r\nlegua nautica has been gradually reduced to one-half or one-third, on\r\naccount of the slowness of travelling across steep mountains, or dry\r\nand burning plains. The common people measure only time directly; and\r\nthen, by arbitrary hypotheses, infer from the time the space of ground\r\ntravelled over. In the course of my geographical researches, I have\r\nhad frequent opportunities of examining the real value of these\r\nleagues, by comparing the itinerary distances between points lying\r\nunder the same meridian with the difference of latitudes.) Oviedo, who\r\nmust so often have passed over the valleys of Aragua, asserts that the\r\ntown of Nueva Valencia del Rey was built in 1555, at the distance of\r\nhalf a league from the lake; and that the proportion between the\r\nlength of the lake and its breadth, is as seven to three. At present,\r\nthe town of Valencia is separated from the lake by level ground of\r\nmore than two thousand seven hundred toises (which Oviedo would no\r\ndoubt have estimated as a space of a league and a half); and the\r\nlength of the basin of the lake is to its breadth as 10 to 2.3, or as\r\n7 to 1.6. The appearance of the soil between Valencia and Guigue, the\r\nlittle hills rising abruptly in the plain east of the Cano de Cambury,\r\nsome of which (el Islote and la Isla de la Negra or Caratapona) have\r\neven preserved the name of islands, sufficiently prove that the waters\r\nhave retired considerably since the time of Oviedo. With respect to\r\nthe change in the general form of the lake, it appears to me\r\nimprobable that in the seventeenth century its breadth was nearly the\r\nhalf of its length. The situation of the granite mountains of Mariara\r\nand of Guigue, the slope of the ground which rises more rapidly\r\ntowards the north and south than towards the east and west, are alike\r\nrepugnant to this supposition.\r\n\r\nIn treating the long-discussed question of the diminution of the\r\nwaters, I conceive we must distinguish between the different periods\r\nat which the sinking of their level has taken place. Wherever we\r\nexamine the valleys of rivers, or the basins of lakes, we see the\r\nancient shore at great distances. No doubt seems now to be\r\nentertained, that our rivers and lakes have undergone immense\r\ndiminutions; but many geological facts remind us also, that these\r\ngreat changes in the distribution of the waters have preceded all\r\nhistorical times; and that for many thousand years most lakes have\r\nattained a permanent equilibrium between the produce of the water\r\nflowing in, and that of evaporation and filtration. Whenever we find\r\nthis equilibrium broken, it will be well rather to examine whether the\r\nrupture be not owing to causes merely local, and of very recent date,\r\nthan to admit an uninterrupted diminution of the water. This reasoning\r\nis conformable to the more circumspect method of modern science. At a\r\ntime when the physical history of the world, traced by the genius of\r\nsome eloquent writers, borrowed all its charms from the fictions of\r\nimagination, the phenomenon of which we are treating would have been\r\nadduced as a new proof of the contrast these writers sought to\r\nestablish between the two continents. To demonstrate that America rose\r\nlater than Asia and Europe from the bosom of the waters, the lake of\r\nTacarigua would have been described as one of those interior basins\r\nwhich have not yet become dry by the effects of slow and gradual\r\nevaporation. I have no doubt that, in very remote times, the whole\r\nvalley, from the foot of the mountains of Cocuyza to those of Torito\r\nand Nirgua, and from La Sierra de Mariara to the chain of Guigue, of\r\nGuacimo, and La Palma, was filled with water. Everywhere the form of\r\nthe promontories, and their steep declivities, seem to indicate the\r\nshore of an alpine lake, similar to those of Styria and Tyrol. The\r\nsame little helicites, the same valvatae, which now live in the lake\r\nof Valencia, are found in layers of three or four feet thick as far\r\ninland as Turmero and La Concesion near La Victoria. These facts\r\nundoubtedly prove a retreat of the waters; but nothing indicates that\r\nthis retreat has continued from a very remote period to our days. The\r\nvalleys of Aragua are among the portions of Venezuela most anciently\r\npeopled; and yet there is no mention in Oviedo, or any other old\r\nchronicler, of a sensible diminution of the lake. Must we suppose,\r\nthat this phenomenon escaped their observation, at a time when the\r\nIndians far exceeded the white population, and when the banks of the\r\nlake were less inhabited? Within half a century, and particularly\r\nwithin these thirty years, the natural desiccation of this great basin\r\nhas excited general attention. We find vast tracts of land which were\r\nformerly inundated, now dry, and already cultivated with plantains,\r\nsugar-canes, or cotton. Wherever a hut is erected on the bank of the\r\nlake, we see the shore receding from year to year. We discover\r\nislands, which, in consequence of the retreat of the waters, are just\r\nbeginning to be joined to the continent, as for instance the rocky\r\nisland of Culebra, in the direction of Guigue; other islands already\r\nform promontories, as the Morro, between Guigue and Nueva Valencia,\r\nand La Cabrera, south-east of Mariara; others again are now rising in\r\nthe islands themselves like scattered hills. Among these last, so\r\neasily recognised at a distance, some are only a quarter of a mile,\r\nothers a league from the present shore. I may cite as the most\r\nremarkable three granite islands, thirty or forty toises high, on the\r\nroad from the Hacienda de Cura to Aguas Calientes; and at the western\r\nextremity of the lake, the Serrito de Don Pedro, Islote, and\r\nCaratapona. On visiting two islands entirely surrounded by water, we\r\nfound in the midst of brushwood, on small flats (four, six, and even\r\neight toises height above the surface of the lake,) fine sand mixed\r\nwith helicites, anciently deposited by the waters. (Isla de Cura and\r\nCabo Blanco. The promontory of Cabrera has been connected with the\r\nshore ever since the year 1750 or 1760 by a little valley, which bears\r\nthe name of Portachuelo.) In each of these islands may be perceived\r\nthe most certain traces of the gradual sinking of the waters. But\r\nstill farther (and this accident is regarded by the inhabitants as a\r\nmarvellous phenomenon) in 1796 three new islands appeared to the east\r\nof the island Caiguira, in the same direction as the islands Burro,\r\nOtama, and Zorro. These new islands, called by the people Los nuevos\r\nPenones, or Los Aparecidos,* (* Los Nuevos Penones, the New Rocks. Los\r\nAparecidos, the Unexpectedly-appeared.) form a kind of banks with\r\nsurfaces quite flat. They rose, in 1800, more than a foot above the\r\nmean level of the water.\r\n\r\nIt has already been observed that the lake of Valencia, like the lakes\r\nof the valley of Mexico, forms the centre of a little system of\r\nrivers, none of which have any communication with the ocean. These\r\nrivers, most of which deserve only the name of torrents, or brooks,*\r\nare twelve or fourteen in number. (* The following are their names:\r\nRios de Aragua, Turmero, Maracay, Tapatapa, Agnes Calientes, Mariara,\r\nCura, Guacara, Guataparo, Valencia, Cano Grande de Cambury, etc.) The\r\ninhabitants, little acquainted with the effects of evaporation, have\r\nlong imagined that the lake has a subterranean outlet, by which a\r\nquantity of water runs out equal to that which flows in by the rivers.\r\nSome suppose that this outlet communicates with grottos, supposed to\r\nbe at great depth; others believe that the water flows through an\r\noblique channel into the basin of the ocean. These bold hypotheses on\r\nthe communication between two neighbouring basins have presented\r\nthemselves in every zone to the imagination of the ignorant, as well\r\nas to that of the learned; for the latter, without confessing it,\r\nsometimes repeat popular opinions in scientific language. We hear of\r\nsubterranean gulfs and outlets in the New World, as on the shores of\r\nthe Caspian sea, though the lake of Tacarigua is two hundred and\r\ntwenty-two toises higher, and the Caspian sea fifty-four toises lower,\r\nthan the sea; and though it is well known, that fluids find the same\r\nlevel, when they communicate by a lateral channel.\r\n\r\nThe changes which the destruction of forests, the clearing of plains,\r\nand the cultivation of indigo, have produced within half a century in\r\nthe quantity of water flowing in on the one hand, and on the other the\r\nevaporation of the soil, and the dryness of the atmosphere, present\r\ncauses sufficiently powerful to explain the progressive diminution of\r\nthe lake of Valencia. I cannot concur in the opinion of M. Depons*\r\n(who visited these countries since I was there) \"that to set the mind\r\nat rest, and for the honour of science,\" a subterranean issue must be\r\nadmitted. (* In his Voyage a la Terre Ferme M. Depons says, \"The small\r\nextent of the surface of the lake renders impossible the supposition\r\nthat evaporation alone, however considerable within the tropics, could\r\nremove as much water as the rivers furnish.\" In the sequel, the author\r\nhimself seems to abandon what he terms \"this occult case, the\r\nhypothesis of an aperture.\") By felling the trees which cover the tops\r\nand the sides of mountains, men in every climate prepare at once two\r\ncalamities for future generations; want of fuel and scarcity of water.\r\nTrees, by the nature of their perspiration, and the radiation from\r\ntheir leaves in a sky without clouds, surround themselves with an\r\natmosphere constantly cold and misty. They affect the copiousness of\r\nsprings, not, as was long believed, by a peculiar attraction for the\r\nvapours diffused through the air, but because, by sheltering the soil\r\nfrom the direct action of the sun, they diminish the evaporation of\r\nwater produced by rain. When forests are destroyed, as they are\r\neverywhere in America by the European planters, with imprudent\r\nprecipitancy, the springs are entirely dried up, or become less\r\nabundant. The beds of the rivers, remaining dry during a part of the\r\nyear, are converted into torrents whenever great rains fall on the\r\nheights. As the sward and moss disappear with the brushwood from the\r\nsides of the mountains, the waters falling in rain are no longer\r\nimpeded in their course; and instead of slowly augmenting the level of\r\nthe rivers by progressive filtrations, they furrow, during heavy\r\nshowers, the sides of the hills, bearing down the loosened soil, and\r\nforming sudden and destructive inundations. Hence it results, that the\r\nclearing of forests, the want of permanent springs, and the existence\r\nof torrents, are three phenomena closely connected together. Countries\r\nsituated in opposite hemispheres, as, for example, Lombardy bordered\r\nby the Alps, and Lower Peru inclosed between the Pacific and the\r\nCordillera of the Andes, afford striking proofs of the justness of\r\nthis assertion.\r\n\r\nTill the middle of the last century, the mountains round the valleys\r\nof Aragua were covered with forests. Great trees of the families of\r\nmimosa, ceiba, and the fig-tree, shaded and spread coolness along the\r\nbanks of the lake. The plain, then thinly inhabited, was filled with\r\nbrushwood, interspersed with trunks of scattered trees and parasite\r\nplants, enveloped with a thick sward, less capable of emitting radiant\r\ncaloric than the soil that is cultivated and consequently not\r\nsheltered from the rays of the sun. With the destruction of the trees,\r\nand the increase of the cultivation of sugar, indigo, and cotton, the\r\nsprings, and all the natural supplies of the lake of Valencia, have\r\ndiminished from year to year. It is difficult to form a just idea of\r\nthe enormous quantity of evaporation which takes place under the\r\ntorrid zone, in a valley surrounded with steep declivities, where a\r\nregular breeze and descending currents of air are felt towards\r\nevening, and the bottom of which is flat, and looks as if levelled by\r\nthe waters. It has been remarked, that the heat which prevails\r\nthroughout the year at Cura, Guacara, Nueva Valencia, and on the\r\nborders of the lake, is the same as that felt at midsummer in Naples\r\nand Sicily. The mean annual temperature of the valleys of Aragua is\r\nnearly 25.5 degrees; my hygrometrical observations of the month of\r\nFebruary, taking the mean of day and night, gave 71.4 degrees of the\r\nhair hygrometer. As the words great drought and great humidity have no\r\ndeterminate signification, and air that would be called very dry in\r\nthe lower regions of the tropics would be regarded as humid in Europe,\r\nwe can judge of these relations between climates only by comparing\r\nspots situated in the same zone. Now at Cumana, where it sometimes\r\ndoes not rain during a whole year, and where I had the means of\r\ncollecting a great number of hygrometric observations made at\r\ndifferent hours of the day and night, the mean humidity of the air is\r\n86 degrees; corresponding to the mean temperature of 27.7 degrees.\r\nTaking into account the influence of the rainy months, that is to say,\r\nestimating the difference observed in other parts of South America\r\nbetween the mean humidity of the dry months and that of the whole\r\nyear; an annual mean humidity is obtained, for the valleys of Aragua,\r\nat farthest of 74 degrees, the temperature being 25.5 degrees. In this\r\nair, so hot, and at the same time so little humid, the quantity of\r\nwater evaporated is enormous. The theory of Dalton estimates, under\r\nthe conditions just stated, for the thickness of the sheet of water\r\nevaporated in an hour's time, 0.36 mill., or 3.8 lines in twenty-four\r\nhours. Assuming for the temperate zone, for instance at Paris, the\r\nmean temperature to be 10.6 degrees, and the mean humidity 82 degrees,\r\nwe find, according to the same formulae, 0.10 mill., an hour, and 1\r\nline for twenty-four hours. If we prefer substituting for the\r\nuncertainty of these theoretical deductions the direct results of\r\nobservation, we may recollect that in Paris, and at Montmorency, the\r\nmean annual evaporation was found by Sedileau and Cotte, to be from 32\r\nin. 1 line to 38 in. 4 lines. Two able engineers in the south of\r\nFrance, Messrs. Clausade and Pin, found, that in subtracting the\r\neffects of filtrations, the waters of the canal of Languedoc, and the\r\nbasin of Saint Ferreol lose every year from 0.758 met. to 0.812 met.,\r\nor from 336 to 360 lines. M. de Prony found nearly similar results in\r\nthe Pontine marshes. The whole of these experiments, made in the\r\nlatitudes of 41 and 49 degrees, and at 10.5 and 16 degrees of mean\r\ntemperature, indicate a mean evaporation of one line, or one and\r\nthree-tenths a day. In the torrid zone, in the West India Islands for\r\ninstance, the effect of evaporation is three times as much, according\r\nto Le Gaux, and double according to Cassan. At Cumana, in a place\r\nwhere the atmosphere is far more loaded with humidity than in the\r\nvalley of Aragua, I have often seen evaporate during twelve hours, in\r\nthe sun, 8.8 mill., in the shade 3.4 mill.; and I believe, that the\r\nannual produce of evaporation in the rivers near Cumana is not less\r\nthan one hundred and thirty inches. Experiments of this kind are\r\nextremely delicate, but what I have stated will suffice to demonstrate\r\nhow great must be the quantity of vapour that rises from the lake of\r\nValencia, and from the surrounding country, the waters of which flow\r\ninto the lake. I shall have occasion elsewhere to resume this subject;\r\nfor, in a work which displays the great laws of nature in different\r\nzones, we must endeavour to solve the problem of the mean tension of\r\nthe vapours contained in the atmosphere in different latitudes, and at\r\ndifferent heights above the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nA great number of local circumstances cause the produce of evaporation\r\nto vary; it changes in proportion as more or less shade covers the\r\nbasin of the waters, with their state of motion or repose, with their\r\ndepth, and the nature and colour of their bottom; but in general\r\nevaporation depends only on three circumstances, the temperature, the\r\ntension of the vapours contained in the atmosphere, and the resistance\r\nwhich the air, more or less dense, more or less agitated, opposes to\r\nthe diffusion of vapour. The quantity of water that evaporates in a\r\ngiven spot, everything else being equal, is proportionate to the\r\ndifference between the quantity of vapour which the ambient air can\r\ncontain when saturated, and the quantity which it actually contains.\r\nHence it follows that the evaporation is not so great in the torrid\r\nzone as might be expected from the enormous augmentation of\r\ntemperature; because, in those ardent climates, the air is habitually\r\nvery humid.\r\n\r\nSince the increase of agricultural industry in the valleys of Aragua,\r\nthe little rivers which run into the lake of Valencia can no longer be\r\nregarded as positive supplies during the six months succeeding\r\nDecember. They remain dried up in the lower part of their course,\r\nbecause the planters of indigo, coffee, and sugar-canes, have made\r\nfrequent drainings (azequias), in order to water the ground by\r\ntrenches. We may observe also, that a pretty considerable river, the\r\nRio Pao, which rises at the entrance of the Llanos, at the foot of the\r\nrange of hills called La Galera, heretofore mingled its waters with\r\nthose of the lake, by uniting with the Cano de Cambury, on the road\r\nfrom the town of Nueva Valencia to Guigue. The course of this river\r\nwas from south to north. At the end of the seventeenth century, the\r\nproprietor of a neighbouring plantation dug at the back of the hill a\r\nnew bed for the Rio Pao. He turned the river; and, after having\r\nemployed part of the water for the irrigation of his fields, he caused\r\nthe rest to flow at a venture southward, following the declivity of\r\nthe Llanos. In this new southern direction the Rio Pao, mingled with\r\nthree other rivers, the Tinaco, the Guanarito, and the Chilua, falls\r\ninto the Portuguesa, which is a branch of the Apure. It is a\r\nremarkable phenomenon, that by a particular position of the ground,\r\nand the lowering of the ridge of division to south-west, the Rio Pao\r\nseparates itself from the little system of interior rivers to which it\r\noriginally belonged, and for a century past has communicated, through\r\nthe channel of the Apure and the Orinoco, with the ocean. What has\r\nbeen here effected on a small scale by the hand of man, nature often\r\nperforms, either by progressively elevating the level of the soil, or\r\nby those falls of the ground occasioned by violent earthquakes. It is\r\nprobable, that in the lapse of ages, several rivers of Soudan, and of\r\nNew Holland, which are now lost in the sands, or in inland basins,\r\nwill open for themselves a course to the shores of the ocean. We\r\ncannot at least doubt, that in both continents there are systems of\r\ninterior rivers, which may be considered as not entirely developed;\r\nand which communicate with each other, either in the time of great\r\nrisings, or by permanent bifurcations.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Pao has scooped itself out a bed so deep and broad, that in\r\nthe season of rains, when the Cano Grande de Cambury inundates all the\r\nland to the north-west of Guigue, the waters of this Cano, and those\r\nof the lake of Valencia, flow back into the Rio Pao itself; so that\r\nthis river, instead of adding water to the lake, tends rather to carry\r\nit away. We see something similar in North America, where geographers\r\nhave represented on their maps an imaginary chain of mountains,\r\nbetween the great lakes of Canada and the country of the Miamis. At\r\nthe time of floods, the waters flowing into the lakes communicate with\r\nthose which run into the Mississippi; and it is practicable to proceed\r\nby boats from the sources of the river St. Mary to the Wabash, as well\r\nas from the Chicago to the Illinois. These analogous facts appear to\r\nme well worthy of the attention of hydrographers.\r\n\r\nThe land that surrounds the lake of Valencia being entirely flat and\r\neven, a diminution of a few inches in the level of the water exposes\r\nto view a vast extent of ground covered with fertile mud and organic\r\nremains.* (* This I observed daily in the Lake of Mexico.) In\r\nproportion as the lake retires, cultivation advances towards the new\r\nshore. These natural desiccations, so important to agriculture, have\r\nbeen considerable during the last ten years, in which America has\r\nsuffered from great droughts. Instead of marking the sinuosities of\r\nthe present banks of the lake, I have advised the rich landholders in\r\nthese countries to fix columns of granite in the basin itself, in\r\norder to observe from year to year the mean height of the waters. The\r\nMarquis del Toro has undertaken to put this design into execution,\r\nemploying the fine granite of the Sierra de Mariara, and establishing\r\nlimnometers, on a bottom of gneiss rock, so common in the lake of\r\nValencia.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to anticipate the limits, more or less narrow, to\r\nwhich this basin of water will one day be confined, when an\r\nequilibrium between the streams flowing in and the produce of\r\nevaporation and filtration, shall be completely established. The idea\r\nvery generally spread, that the lake will soon entirely disappear,\r\nseems to me chimerical. If in consequence of great earthquakes, or\r\nother causes equally mysterious, ten very humid years should succeed\r\nto long droughts; if the mountains should again become clothed with\r\nforests, and great trees overshadow the shore and the plains of\r\nAragua, we should more probably see the volume of the waters augment,\r\nand menace that beautiful cultivation which now trenches on the basin\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the cultivators of the valleys of Aragua fear the total\r\ndisappearance of the lake, and others its return to the banks it has\r\ndeserted, we hear the question gravely discussed at Caracas, whether\r\nit would not be advisable, in order to give greater extent to\r\nagriculture, to conduct the waters of the lake into the Llanos, by\r\ndigging a canal towards the Rio Pao. The possibility* of this\r\nenterprise cannot be denied, particularly by having recourse to\r\ntunnels, or subterranean canals. (The dividing ridge, namely, that\r\nwhich divides the waters between the valleys of Aragua and the Llanos,\r\nlowers so much towards the west of Guigue, as we have already\r\nobserved, that there are ravines which conduct the waters of the Cano\r\nde Cambury, the Rio Valencia, and the Guataparo, in the time of\r\nfloods, to the Rio Pao; but it would be easier to open a navigable\r\ncanal from the lake of Valencia to the Orinoco, by the Pao, the\r\nPortuguesa, and the Apure, than to dig a draining canal level with the\r\nbottom of the lake. This bottom, according to the sounding, and my\r\nbarometric measurements, is 40 toises less than 222, or 182 above the\r\nsurface of the ocean. On the road from Guigue to the Llanos, by the\r\ntable-land of La Villa de Cura, I found, to the south of the dividing\r\nridge, and on its southern declivity, no point of level corresponding\r\nto the 182 toises, except near San Juan. The absolute height of this\r\nvillage is 194 toises. But, I repeat that, farther towards the west,\r\nin the country between the Cano de Cambury and the sources of the Rio\r\nPao, which I was not able to visit, the point of level of the bottom\r\nof the lake is much further north.) The progressive retreat of the\r\nwaters has given birth to the beautiful and luxuriant plains of\r\nMaracay, Cura, Mocundo, Guigue, and Santa Cruz del Escoval, planted\r\nwith tobacco, sugar-canes, coffee, indigo, and cacao; but how can it\r\nbe doubted for a moment that the lake alone spreads fertility over\r\nthis country? If deprived of the enormous mass of vapour which the\r\nsurface of the waters sends forth daily into the atmosphere, the\r\nvalleys of Aragua would become as dry and barren as the surrounding\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe mean depth of the lake is from twelve to fifteen fathoms; the\r\ndeepest parts are not, as is generally admitted, eighty, but\r\nthirty-five or forty deep. Such is the result of soundings made with\r\nthe greatest care by Don Antonio Manzano. When we reflect on the vast\r\ndepths of all the lakes of Switzerland, which, notwithstanding their\r\nposition in high valleys, almost reach the level of the Mediterranean,\r\nit appears surprising that greater cavities are not found at the\r\nbottom of the lake of Valencia, which is also an Alpine lake. The\r\ndeepest places are between the rocky island of Burro and the point of\r\nCana Fistula, and opposite the high mountains of Mariara. But in\r\ngeneral the southern part of the lake is deeper than the northern: nor\r\nmust we forget that, if all the shores be now low, the southern part\r\nof the basin is the nearest to a chain of mountains with abrupt\r\ndeclivities; and we know that even the sea is generally deepest where\r\nthe coast is elevated, rocky, or perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the lake at the surface during my abode in the\r\nvalleys of Aragua, in the month of February, was constantly from 23 to\r\n23.7 degrees, consequently a little below the mean temperature of the\r\nair. This may be from the effect of evaporation, which carries off\r\ncaloric from the air and the water; or because a great mass of water\r\ndoes not follow with an equal rapidity the changes in the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere, and the lake receives streams which rise from\r\nseveral cold springs in the neighbouring mountains. I have to regret\r\nthat, notwithstanding its small depth, I could not determine the\r\ntemperature of the water at thirty or forty fathoms. I was not\r\nprovided with the thermometrical sounding apparatus which I had used\r\nin the Alpine lakes of Salzburg, and in the Caribbean Sea. The\r\nexperiments of Saussure prove that, on both sides of the Alps, the\r\nlakes which are from one hundred and ninety to two hundred and\r\nseventy-four toises of absolute elevation* (* This is the difference\r\nbetween the absolute elevations of the lakes of Geneva and Thun.)\r\nhave, in the middle of winter, at nine hundred, at six hundred, and\r\nsometimes even at one hundred and fifty feet of depth, a uniform\r\ntemperature from 4.3 to 6 degrees: but these experiments have not yet\r\nbeen repeated in lakes situated under the torrid zone. The strata of\r\ncold water in Switzerland are of an enormous thickness. They have been\r\nfound so near the surface in the lakes of Geneva and Bienne, that the\r\ndecrement of heat in the water was one centesimal degree for ten or\r\nfifteen feet; that is to say, eight times more rapid than in the\r\nocean, and forty-eight times more rapid than in the atmosphere. In the\r\ntemperate zone, where the heat of the atmosphere sinks to the freezing\r\npoint, and far lower, the bottom of a lake, even were it not\r\nsurrounded by glaciers and mountains covered with eternal snow, must\r\ncontain particles of water which, having during winter acquired at the\r\nsurface the maximum of their density, between 3.4 and 4.4 degrees,\r\nhave consequently fallen to the greatest depth. Other particles, the\r\ntemperature of which is +0.5 degrees, far from placing themselves\r\nbelow the stratum at 4 degrees, can only find their hydrostatic\r\nequilibrium above that stratum. They will descend lower only when\r\ntheir temperature is augmented 3 or 4 degrees by the contact of strata\r\nless cold. If water in cooling continued to condense uniformly to the\r\nfreezing point, there would be found, in very deep lakes and basins\r\nhaving no communication with each other (whatever the latitude of the\r\nplace), a stratum of water, the temperature of which would be nearly\r\nequal to the maximum of refrigeration above the freezing point, which\r\nthe lower regions of the ambient atmosphere annually attain. Hence it\r\nis probable, that, in the plains of the torrid zone, or in the valleys\r\nbut little elevated, the mean heat of which is from 25.5 to 27\r\ndegrees, the temperature of the bottom of the lakes can never be below\r\n21 or 22 degrees. If in the same zone the ocean contain at depths of\r\nseven or eight hundred fathoms, water the temperature of which is at 7\r\ndegrees, that is to say, twelve or thirteen degrees colder than the\r\nmaximum of the heat* of the equinoctial atmosphere over the sea, I\r\nthink it must be considered as a direct proof of a submarine current,\r\ncarrying the waters of the pole towards the equator. (* It is almost\r\nsuperfluous to observe that I am considering here only that part of\r\nthe atmosphere lying on the ocean between 10 degrees north and 10\r\ndegrees south latitude. Towards the northern limits of the torrid\r\nzone, in latitude 23 degrees, whither the north winds bring with an\r\nextreme rapidity the cold air of Canada, the thermometer falls at sea\r\nas low as 16 degrees, and even lower.) We will not here solve the\r\ndelicate problem, as to the manner in which, within the tropics and in\r\nthe temperate zone, (for example, in the Caribbean Sea and in the\r\nlakes of Switzerland,) these inferior strata of water, cooled to 4 or\r\n7 degrees, act upon the temperature of the stony strata of the globe\r\nwhich they cover; and how these same strata, the primitive temperature\r\nof which is, within the tropics, 27 degrees, and at the lake of Geneva\r\n10 degrees, react upon the half-frozen waters at the bottom of the\r\nlakes, and of the equinoctial ocean. These questions are of the\r\nhighest importance, both with regard to the economy of animals that\r\nlive habitually at the bottom of fresh and salt waters, and to the\r\ntheory of the distribution of heat in lands surrounded by vast and\r\ndeep seas.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Valencia is full of islands, which embellish the scenery\r\nby the picturesque form of their rocks, and the beauty of the\r\nvegetation with which they are covered: an advantage which this\r\ntropical lake possesses over those of the Alps. The islands are\r\nfifteen in number, distributed in three groups;* without reckoning\r\nMorro and Cabrera, which are already joined to the shore. (* The\r\nposition of these islands is as follows: northward, near the shore,\r\nthe Isla de Cura; on the south-east, Burro, Horno, Otama, Sorro,\r\nCaiguira, Nuevos Penones, or the Aparecidos; on the north-west, Cabo\r\nBlanco, or Isla de Aves, and Chamberg; on the south-west, Brucha and\r\nCulebra. In the centre of the lake rise, like shoals or small detached\r\nrocks, Vagre, Fraile, Penasco, and Pan de Azucar.) They are partly\r\ncultivated, and extremely fertile on account of the vapours that rise\r\nfrom the lake. Burro, the largest of these islands, is two miles in\r\nlength, and is inhabited by some families of mestizos, who rear goats.\r\nThese simple people seldom visit the shore of Mocundo. To them the\r\nlake appears of immense extent; they have plantains, cassava, milk,\r\nand a little fish. A hut constructed of reeds; hammocks woven from the\r\ncotton which the neighbouring fields produce; a large stone on which\r\nthe fire is made; the ligneous fruit of the tutuma (the calabash) in\r\nwhich they draw water, constitute their domestic establishment. An old\r\nmestizo who offered us some goat's milk had a beautiful daughter. We\r\nlearned from our guide, that solitude had rendered him as mistrustful\r\nas he might perhaps have been made by the society of men. The day\r\nbefore our arrival, some hunters had visited the island. They were\r\novertaken by the shades of night; and preferred sleeping in the open\r\nair to returning to Mocundo. This news spread alarm throughout the\r\nisland. The father obliged the young girl to climb up a very lofty\r\nzamang or acacia, which grew in the plain at some distance from the\r\nhut, while he stretched himself at the foot of the tree, and did not\r\npermit his daughter to descend till the hunters had departed.\r\n\r\nThe lake is in general well stocked with fish; though it furnishes\r\nonly three kinds, the flesh of which is soft and insipid, the guavina,\r\nthe vagre, and the sardina. The two last descend into the lake with\r\nthe streams that flow into it. The guavina, of which I made a drawing\r\non the spot, is 20 inches long and 3.5 broad. It is perhaps a new\r\nspecies of the genus erythrina of Gronovius. It has large silvery\r\nscales edged with green. This fish is extremely voracious, and\r\ndestroys other kinds. The fishermen assured us that a small crocodile,\r\nthe bava,* which often approached us when we were bathing, contributes\r\nalso to the destruction of the fish. (* The bava, or bavilla, is very\r\ncommon at Bordones, near Cumana. See volume 1. The name of bava,\r\nbaveuse, has misled M. Depons; he takes this reptile for a fish of our\r\nseas, the Blennius pholis. Voyage a la Terre Ferme. The Blennius\r\npholis, smooth blenny, is called by the French baveuse (slaverer), in\r\nSpanish, baba.) We never could succeed in procuring this reptile so as\r\nto examine it closely: it generally attains only three or four feet in\r\nlength. It is said to be very harmless; its habits however, as well as\r\nits form, much resemble those of the alligator (Crocodilus acutus). It\r\nswims in such a manner as to show only the point of its snout, and the\r\nextremity of its tail; and places itself at mid-day on the bare beach.\r\nIt is certainly neither a monitor (the real monitors living only in\r\nthe old continent,) nor the sauvegarde of Seba (Lacerta teguixin,)\r\nwhich dives and does not swim. It is somewhat remarkable that the lake\r\nof Valencia, and the whole system of small rivers flowing into it,\r\nhave no large alligators, though this dangerous animal abounds a few\r\nleagues off in the streams which flow either into the Apure or the\r\nOrinoco, or immediately into the Caribbean Sea between Porto Cabello\r\nand La Guayra.\r\n\r\nIn the islands that rise like bastions in the midst of the waters, and\r\nwherever the rocky bottom of the lake is visible, I recognised a\r\nuniform direction in the strata of gneiss. This direction is nearly\r\nthat of the chains of mountains on the north and south of the lake. In\r\nthe hills of Cabo Blanco there are found among the gneiss, angular\r\nmasses of opaque quartz, slightly translucid on the edges, and varying\r\nfrom grey to deep black. This quartz passes sometimes into hornstein,\r\nand sometimes into kieselschiefer (schistose jasper). I do not think\r\nit constitutes a vein. The waters of the lake* decompose the gneiss by\r\nerosion in a very extraordinary manner. (* The water of the lake is\r\nnot salt, as is asserted at Caracas. It may be drunk without being\r\nfiltered. On evaporation it leaves a very small residuum of carbonate\r\nof lime, and perhaps a little nitrate of potash. It is surprising that\r\nan inland lake should not be richer in alkaline and earthy salts,\r\nacquired from the neighbouring soils. I have found parts of it porous,\r\nalmost cellular, and split in the form of cauliflowers, fixed on\r\ngneiss perfectly compact. Perhaps the action ceases with the movement\r\nof the waves, and the alternate contact of air and water.\r\n\r\nThe island of Chamberg is remarkable for its height. It is a rock of\r\ngneiss, with two summits in the form of a saddle, and raised two\r\nhundred feet above the surface of the water. The slope of this rock is\r\nbarren, and affords only nourishment for a few plants of clusia with\r\nlarge white flowers. But the view of the lake and of the richly\r\ncultivated neighbouring valleys is beautiful, and their aspect is\r\nwonderful after sunset, when thousands of aquatic birds, herons,\r\nflamingoes, and wild ducks cross the lake to roost in the islands, and\r\nthe broad zone of mountains which surrounds the horizon is covered\r\nwith fire. The inhabitants, as we have already mentioned, burn the\r\nmeadows in order to produce fresher and finer grass. Gramineous plants\r\nabound, especially at the summit of the chain; and those vast\r\nconflagrations extend sometimes the length of a thousand toises, and\r\nappear like streams of lava overflowing the ridge of the mountains.\r\nWhen reposing on the banks of the lake to enjoy the soft freshness of\r\nthe air in one of those beautiful evenings peculiar to the tropics, it\r\nis delightful to contemplate in the waves as they beat the shore, the\r\nreflection of the red fires that illumine the horizon.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants which grow on the rocky islands of the lake of\r\nValencia, many have been believed to be peculiar to those spots,\r\nbecause till now they have not been discovered elsewhere. Such are the\r\npapaw-trees of the lake; and the tomato* of the island of Cura. (* The\r\ntomatoes are cultivated, as well as the papaw-tree of the lake, in the\r\nBotanical Garden of Berlin, to which I had sent some seeds.) The\r\nlatter differs from our Solanum lycopersicum; the fruit is round and\r\nsmall, but has a fine flavour; it is now cultivated at La Victoria, at\r\nNueva Valencia, and everywhere in the valleys of Aragua. The\r\npapaw-tree of the lake (papaya de la laguna) abounds also in the\r\nisland of Cura and at Cabo Blanco; its trunk shoots higher than that\r\nof the common papaw (Carica papaya), but its fruit is only half as\r\nlarge, perfectly spherical, without projecting ribs, and four or five\r\ninches in diameter. When cut open it is found quite filled with seeds,\r\nand without those hollow places which occur constantly in the common\r\npapaw. The taste of this fruit, of which I have often eaten, is\r\nextremely sweet.* (* The people of the country attribute to it an\r\nastringent quality, and call it tapaculo.) I know not whether it be a\r\nvariety of the Carica microcarpa, described by Jacquin.\r\n\r\nThe environs of the lake are insalubrious only in times of great\r\ndrought, when the waters in their retreat leave a muddy sediment\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun. The banks, shaded by tufts of\r\nCoccoloba barbadensis, and decorated with fine liliaceous plants,* (*\r\nPancratium undulatum, Amaryllis nervosa.) remind us, by the appearance\r\nof the aquatic vegetation, of the marshy shores of our lakes in\r\nEurope. We find there, pondweed (potamogeton), chara, and cats'-tail\r\nthree feet high, which it is difficult not to confound with the Typha\r\nangustifolia of our marshes. It is only after a careful examination,\r\nthat we recognise each of these plants for distinct species,* (*\r\nPotamogeton tenuifolium, Chara compressa, Typha tenuifolia.) peculiar\r\nto the new continent. How many plants of the straits of Magellan, of\r\nChile, and the Cordilleras of Quito have formerly been confounded with\r\nthe productions of the northern temperate zone, owing to their analogy\r\nin form and appearance.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the valleys of Aragua often inquire why the\r\nsouthern shore of the lake, particularly the south-west part towards\r\nlos Aguacotis, is generally more shaded, and exhibits fresher verdure\r\nthan the northern side. We saw, in the month of February, many trees\r\nstripped of their foliage, near the Hacienda de Cura, at Mocundo, and\r\nat Guacara; while to the south-east of Valencia everything presaged\r\nthe approach of the rains. I believe that in the early part of the\r\nyear, when the sun has southern declination, the hills around\r\nValencia, Guacara, and Cura are scorched by the heat of the solar\r\nrays, while the southern shore receives, along with the breeze when it\r\nenters the valley by the Abra de Porto Cabello, an atmosphere which\r\nhas crossed the lake, and is loaded with aqueous vapour. On this\r\nsouthern shore, near Guaruto, are situated the finest plantations of\r\ntobacco in the whole province.\r\n\r\nAmong the rivers flowing into the lake of Valencia some owe their\r\norigin to thermal springs, and deserve particular attention. These\r\nsprings gush out at three points of the granitic Cordillera of the\r\ncoast; near Onoto, between Turmero and Maracay; near Mariara,\r\nnorth-east of the Hacienda de Cura; and near Las Trincheras, on the\r\nroad from Nueva Valencia to Porto Cabello. I could examine with care\r\nonly the physical and geological relations of the thermal waters of\r\nMariara and Las Trincheras. In going up the small river Cura towards\r\nits source, the mountains of Mariara are seen advancing into the plain\r\nin the form of a vast amphitheatre, composed of perpendicular rocks,\r\ncrowned by peaks with rugged summits. The central point of the\r\namphitheatre bears the strange name of the Devil's Nook (Rincon del\r\nDiablo). The range stretching to the east is called El Chaparro; that\r\nto the west, Las Viruelas. These ruin-like rocks command the plain;\r\nthey are composed of a coarse-grained granite, nearly porphyritic, the\r\nyellowish white feldspar crystals of which are more than an inch and a\r\nhalf long. Mica is rare in them, and is of a fine silvery lustre.\r\nNothing can be more picturesque and solemn than the aspect of this\r\ngroup of mountains, half covered with vegetation. The Peak of\r\nCalavera, which unites the Rincon del Diablo to the Chaparro, is\r\nvisible from afar. In it the granite is separated by perpendicular\r\nfissures into prismatic masses. It would seem as if the primitive rock\r\nwere crowned with columns of basalt. In the rainy season, a\r\nconsiderable sheet of water rushes down like a cascade from these\r\ncliffs. The mountains connected on the east with the Rincon del\r\nDiablo, are much less lofty, and contain, like the promontory of La\r\nCabrera, and the little detached hills in the plain, gneiss and\r\nmica-slate, including garnets.\r\n\r\nIn these lower mountains, two or three miles north-east of Mariara, we\r\nfind the ravine of hot waters called Quebrada de Aguas Calientes. This\r\nravine, running north-west 75 degrees, contains several small basins.\r\nOf these the two uppermost, which have no communication with each\r\nother, are only eight inches in diameter; the three lower, from two to\r\nthree feet. Their depth varies from three to fifteen inches. The\r\ntemperature of these different funnels (pozos) is from 56 to 59\r\ndegrees; and what is remarkable, the lower funnels are hotter than the\r\nupper, though the difference of the level is only seven or eight\r\ninches. The hot waters, collected together, form a little rivulet,\r\ncalled the Rio de Aguas Calientes, which, thirty feet lower, has a\r\ntemperature of only 48 degrees. In seasons of great drought, the time\r\nat which we visited the ravine, the whole body of the thermal waters\r\nforms a section of only twenty-six square inches. This is considerably\r\naugmented in the rainy season; the rivulet is then transformed into a\r\ntorrent, and its heat diminishes for it appears that the hot springs\r\nthemselves are subject only to imperceptible variations. All these\r\nsprings are slightly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The\r\nfetid smell, peculiar to this gas, can be perceived only by\r\napproaching very near the springs. In one of these wells only, the\r\ntemperature of which is 56.2 degrees, bubbles of air are evolved at\r\nnearly regular intervals of two or three minutes. I observed that\r\nthese bubbles constantly rose from the same points, which are four in\r\nnumber; and that it was not possible to change the places from which\r\nthe gas is emitted, by stirring the bottom of the basin with a stick.\r\nThese places correspond no doubt to holes or fissures on the gneiss;\r\nand indeed when the bubbles rise from one of the apertures, the\r\nemission of gas follows instantly from the other three. I could not\r\nsucceed in inflaming the small quantities of gas that rise above the\r\nthermal waters, or those I collected in a glass phial held over the\r\nsprings, an operation that excited in me a nausea, caused less by the\r\nsmell of the gas, than by the excessive heat prevailing in this\r\nravine. Is this sulphuretted hydrogen mixed with a great proportion of\r\ncarbonic acid or atmospheric air? I am doubtful of the first of these\r\nmixtures, though so common in thermal waters; for example at Aix la\r\nChapelle, Enghien, and Bareges. The gas collected in the tube of\r\nFontana's eudiometer had been shaken for a long time with water. The\r\nsmall basins are covered with a light film of sulphur, deposited by\r\nthe sulphuretted hydrogen in its slow combustion in contact with the\r\natmospheric oxygen. A few plants near the springs were encrusted with\r\nsulphur. This deposit is scarcely visible when the water of Mariara is\r\nsuffered to cool in an open vessel; no doubt because the quantity of\r\ndisengaged gas is very small, and is not renewed. The water, when\r\ncold, gives no precipitate with a solution of nitrate of copper; it is\r\ndestitute of flavour, and very drinkable. If it contain any saline\r\nsubstances, for example, the sulphates of soda or magnesia, their\r\nquantities must be very insignificant. Being almost destitute of\r\nchemical tests,* (* A small case, containing acetate of lead, nitrate\r\nof silver, alcohol, prussiate of potash, etc., had been left by\r\nmistake at Cumana. I evaporated some of the water of Mariara, and it\r\nyielded only a very small residuum, which, digested with nitric acid,\r\nappeared to contain only a little silica and extractive vegetable\r\nmatter.) we contented ourselves with filling at the spring two\r\nbottles, which were sent, along with the nourishing milk of the tree\r\ncalled palo de vaca, to MM. Fourcroy and Vauquelin, by the way of\r\nPorto Cabello and the Havannah. This purity in hot waters issuing\r\nimmediately from granite mountains is in Europe, as well as in the New\r\nContinent, a most curious phenomenon.* (* Warm springs equally pure\r\nare found issuing from the granites of Portugal, and those of Cantal.\r\nIn Italy, the Pisciarelli of the lake Agnano have a temperature equal\r\nto 93 degrees. Are these pure waters produced by condensed vapours?)\r\nHow can we explain the origin of the sulphuretted hydrogen? It cannot\r\nproceed from the decomposition of sulphurets of iron, or pyritic\r\nstrata. Is it owing to sulphurets of calcium, of magnesium, or other\r\nearthy metalloids, contained in the interior of our planet, under its\r\nrocky and oxidated crust?\r\n\r\nIn the ravine of the hot waters of Mariara, amidst little funnels, the\r\ntemperature of which rises from 56 to 59 degrees, two species of\r\naquatic plants vegetate; the one is membranaceous, and contains\r\nbubbles of air; the other has parallel fibres. The first much\r\nresembles the Ulva labyrinthiformis of Vandelli, which the thermal\r\nwaters of Europe furnish. At the island of Amsterdam, tufts of\r\nlycopodium and marchantia have been seen in places where the heat of\r\nthe soil was far greater: such is the effect of an habitual stimulus\r\non the organs of plants. The waters of Mariara contain no aquatic\r\ninsects. Frogs are found in them, which, being probably chased by\r\nserpents, have leaped into the funnels, and there perished.\r\n\r\nSouth of the ravine, in the plain extending towards the shore of the\r\nlake, another sulphureous spring gushes out, less hot and less\r\nimpregnated with gas. The crevice whence this water issues is six\r\ntoises higher than the funnel just described. The thermometer did not\r\nrise in the crevice above 42 degrees. The water is collected in a\r\nbasin surrounded by large trees; it is nearly circular, from fifteen\r\nto eighteen feet diameter, and three feet deep. The slaves throw\r\nthemselves into this bath at the end of the day, when covered with\r\ndust, after having worked in the neighbouring fields of indigo and\r\nsugar-cane. Though the water of this bath (bano) is habitually from 12\r\nto 14 degrees hotter than the air, the negroes call it refreshing;\r\nbecause in the torrid zone this term is used for whatever restores\r\nstrength, calms the irritation of the nerves, or causes a feeling of\r\ncomfort. We ourselves experienced the salutary effects of the bath.\r\nHaving slung our hammocks on the trees round the basin, we passed a\r\nwhole day in this charming spot, which abounds in plants. We found\r\nnear the bano of Mariara the volador, or gyrocarpus. The winged fruits\r\nof this large tree turn like a fly-wheel, when they fall from the\r\nstalk. On shaking the branches of the volador, we saw the air filled\r\nwith its fruits, the simultaneous fall of which presents the most\r\nsingular spectacle. The two membranaceous and striated wings are\r\nturned so as to meet the air, in falling, at an angle of 45 degrees.\r\nFortunately the fruits we gathered were at their maturity. We sent\r\nsome to Europe, and they have germinated in the gardens of Berlin,\r\nParis, and Malmaison. The numerous plants of the volador, now seen in\r\nhot-houses, owe their origin to the only tree of the kind found near\r\nMariara. The geographical distribution of the different species of\r\ngyrocarpus, which Mr. Brown considers as one of the laurineae, is very\r\nsingular. Jacquin saw one species near Carthagena in America.* (* The\r\nGyrocarpus Jacquini of Gartner, or Gyrocarpus americanus of\r\nWilldenouw.) This is the same which we met with again in Mexico, near\r\nZumpango, on the road from Acapulco to the capital.* (* The natives of\r\nMexico called it quitlacoctli. I saw some of its young leaves with\r\nthree and five lobes; the full-grown leaves are in the form of a\r\nheart, and always with three lobes. We never met with the volador in\r\nflower.) Another species, which grows on the mountains of Coromandel,*\r\n(* This is the Gyrocarpus asiaticus of Willdenouw.) has been described\r\nby Roxburgh; the third and fourth* grow in the southern hemisphere, on\r\nthe coasts of Australia. (* Gyrocarpus sphenopterus, and G. rugosus.)\r\n\r\nAfter getting out of the bath, while, half-wrapped in a sheet, we were\r\ndrying ourselves in the sun, according to the custom of the country, a\r\nlittle man of the mulatto race approached us. After bowing gravely, he\r\nmade us a long speech on the virtues of the waters of Mariara,\r\nadverting to the numbers of invalids by whom they have been visited\r\nfor some years past, and to the favourable situation of the springs,\r\nbetween the two towns Valencia and Caracas. He showed us his house, a\r\nlittle hut covered with palm-leaves, situated in an enclosure at a\r\nsmall distance, on the bank of a rivulet, communicating with the bath.\r\nHe assured us that we should there find all the conveniences of life;\r\nnails to suspend our hammocks, ox-leather to stretch over benches made\r\nof reeds, earthern vases always filled with cool water, and what,\r\nafter the bath, would be most salutary of all, those great lizards\r\n(iguanas), the flesh of which is known to be a refreshing aliment. We\r\njudged from his harangue, that this good man took us for invalids, who\r\nhad come to stay near the spring. His counsels and offers of\r\nhospitality were not altogether disinterested. He styled himself the\r\ninspector of the waters, and the pulpero* (* Proprietor of a pulperia,\r\nor little shop where refreshments are sold.) of the place. Accordingly\r\nall his obliging attentions to us ceased as soon as he heard that we\r\nhad come merely to satisfy our curiosity; or as they express it in the\r\nSpanish colonies, those lands of idleness, para ver, no mas, to see,\r\nand nothing more. The waters of Mariara are used with success in\r\nrheumatic swellings, and affections of the skin. As the waters are but\r\nvery feebly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, it is necessary to\r\nbathe at the spot where the springs issue. Farther on, these same\r\nwaters are employed for the irrigation of fields of indigo. A wealthy\r\nlanded proprietor of Mariara, Don Domingo Tovar, had formed the\r\nproject of erecting a bathing-house, and an establishment which would\r\nfurnish visitors with better resources than lizard's flesh for food,\r\nand leather stretched on a bench for their repose.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February, in the evening, we set out from the beautiful\r\nHacienda de Cura for Guacara and Nueva Valencia. We preferred\r\ntravelling by night, on account of the excessive heat of the day. We\r\npassed by the hamlet of Punta Zamuro, at the foot of the high\r\nmountains of Las Viruelas. The road is bordered with large\r\nzamang-trees, or mimosas, the trunks of which rise to sixty feet high.\r\nTheir branches, nearly horizontal, meet at more than one hundred and\r\nfifty feet distance. I have nowhere seen a vault of verdure more\r\nbeautiful and luxuriant. The night was gloomy: the Rincon del Diablo\r\nwith its denticulated rocks appeared from time to time at a distance,\r\nillumined by the burning of the savannahs, or wrapped in ruddy smoke.\r\nAt the spot where the bushes were thickest, our horses were frightened\r\nby the yell of an animal that seemed to follow us closely. It was a\r\nlarge jaguar, which had roamed for three years among these mountains.\r\nHe had constantly escaped the pursuits of the boldest hunters, and had\r\ncarried off horses and mules from the midst of enclosures; but, having\r\nno want of food, had not yet attacked men. The negro who conducted us\r\nuttered wild cries, expecting by these means to frighten the tiger;\r\nbut his efforts were ineffectual. The jaguar, like the wolf of Europe,\r\nfollows travellers even when he will not attack them; the wolf in the\r\nopen fields and in unsheltered places, the jaguar skirting the road\r\nand appearing only at intervals between the bushes.\r\n\r\nWe passed the day on the 23rd in the house of the Marquis de Toro, at\r\nthe village of Guacara, a very considerable Indian community. An\r\navenue of carolineas leads from Guacara to Mocundo. It was the first\r\ntime I had seen in the open air this majestic plant, which forms one\r\nof the principal ornaments of the extensive conservatories of\r\nSchonbrunn.* (* Every tree of the Carolinea princeps at Schonbrunn has\r\nsprung from seeds collected from one single tree of enormous size,\r\nnear Chacao, east of Caracas.) Mocundo is a rich plantation of\r\nsugar-canes, belonging to the family of Toro. We there find, what is\r\nso rare in that country, a garden, artificial clumps of trees, and on\r\nthe border of the water, upon a rock of gneiss, a pavilion with a\r\nmirador, or belvidere. The view is delightful over the western part of\r\nthe lake, the surrounding mountains, and a forest of palm-trees that\r\nseparates Guacara from the city of Nueva Valencia. The fields of\r\nsugar-cane, from the soft verdure of the young reeds, resemble a vast\r\nmeadow. Everything denotes abundance; but it is at the price of the\r\nliberty of the cultivators. At Mocundo, with two hundred and thirty\r\nnegroes, seventy-seven tablones, or cane-fields, are cultivated, each\r\nof which, ten thousand varas square,* (* A tablon, equal to 1849\r\nsquare toises, contains nearly an acre and one-fifth: a legal acre has\r\n1344 square toises, and 1.95 legal acre is equal to one hectare.)\r\nyields a net profit of two hundred or two hundred and forty piastres\r\na-year. The creole cane and the cane of Otaheite* are planted in the\r\nmonth of April, the first at four, the second at five feet distance.\r\n(* In the island of Palma, where in the latitude of 29 degrees the\r\nsugar-cane is said to be cultivated as high as 140 toises above the\r\nlevel of the Atlantic, the Otaheite cane requires more heat than the\r\nCreole cane.) The cane ripens in fourteen months. It flowers in the\r\nmonth of October, if the plant be sufficiently vigorous; but the top\r\nis cut off before the panicle unfolds. In all the monocotyledonous\r\nplants (for example, the maguey cultivated at Mexico for extracting\r\npulque, the wine-yielding palm-tree, and the sugar-cane), the\r\nflowering alters the quality of the juices. The preparation of sugar,\r\nthe boiling, and the claying, are very imperfect in Terra Firma,\r\nbecause it is made only for home consumption; and for wholesale,\r\npapelon is preferred to sugar, either refined or raw. This papelon is\r\nan impure sugar, in the form of little loaves, of a yellow-brown\r\ncolour. It contains a mixture of molasses and mucilaginous matter. The\r\npoorest man eats papelon, as in Europe he eats cheese. It is believed\r\nto have nutritive qualities. Fermented with water it yields the\r\nguarapo, the favourite beverage of the people. In the province of\r\nCaracas subcarbonate of potash is used, instead of lime, to purify the\r\njuice of the sugar-cane. The ashes of the bucare, which is the\r\nErythrina corallodendrum, are preferred.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane was introduced very late, probably towards the end of\r\nthe sixteenth century, from the West India Islands, into the valleys\r\nof Aragua. It was known in India, in China, and in all the islands of\r\nthe Pacific, from the most remote antiquity; and it was planted at\r\nKhorassan, in Persia, as early as the fifth century of our era, in\r\norder to obtain from it solid sugar.* (* The Indian name for the\r\nsugar-cane is sharkara. Thence the word sugar.) The Arabs carried this\r\nreed, so useful to the inhabitants of hot and temperate countries, to\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean. In 1306, its cultivation was yet\r\nunknown in Sicily; but was already common in the island of Cyprus, at\r\nRhodes, and in the Morea. A hundred years after it enriched Calabria,\r\nSicily, and the coasts of Spain. From Sicily the Infante Don Henry\r\ntransported the cane to Madeira: from Madeira it passed to the Canary\r\nIslands, where it was entirely unknown; for the ferulae of Juba, quae\r\nexpressae liquorem fundunt potui ucundum, are euphorbias (the Tabayba\r\ndulce), and not, as has been recently asserted,* sugar-canes. (* On\r\nthe origin of cane-sugar, in the Journal de Pharmacie 1816 page 387.\r\nThe Tabayba dulce is, according to Von Buch, the Euphorbia\r\nbalsamifera, the juice of which is neither corrosive nor bitter like\r\nthat of the cardon, or Euphorbia canariensis.) Twelve\r\nsugar-manufactories (ingenios de azucar) were soon established in the\r\nisland of Great Canary, in that of Palma, and between Adexe, Icod, and\r\nGuarachico, in the island of Teneriffe. Negroes were employed in this\r\ncultivation, and their descendants still inhabit the grottos of\r\nTiraxana, in the Great Canary. Since the sugar-cane has been\r\ntransplanted to the West Indies, and the New World has given maize to\r\nthe Canaries, the cultivation of the latter has taken the place of the\r\ncane at Teneriffe and the Great Canary. The cane is now found only in\r\nthe island of Palma, near Argual and Tazacorte,* where it yields\r\nscarcely one thousand quintals of sugar a year. (* \"Notice sur la\r\nCulture du Sucre dans les Isles Canariennes\" by Leopold von Buch.) The\r\nsugar-cane of the Canaries, which Aiguilon transported to St. Domingo,\r\nwas there cultivated extensively as early as 1513, or during the six\r\nor seven following years, under the auspices of the monks of St.\r\nJerome. Negroes were employed in this cultivation from its\r\ncommencement; and in 1519 representations were made to government, as\r\nin our own time, that the West India Islands would be ruined and made\r\ndesert, if slaves were not conveyed thither annually from the coast of\r\nGuinea.\r\n\r\nFor some years past the culture and preparation of sugar has been much\r\nimproved in Terra Firma; and, as the process of refining is prohibited\r\nby the laws at Jamaica, they reckon on the fraudulent exportation of\r\nrefined sugar to the English colonies. But the consumption of the\r\nprovinces of Venezuela, in papelon, and in raw sugar employed in\r\nmaking chocolate and sweetmeats (dulces) is so enormous, that the\r\nexportation has been hitherto entirely null. The finest plantations of\r\nsugar are in the valleys of Aragua and of the Tuy, near Pao de Zarate,\r\nbetween La Victoria and San Sebastian, near Guatire, Guarenas, and\r\nCaurimare. The first canes arrived in the New World from the Canary\r\nIslands; and even now Canarians, or Islenos, are placed at the head of\r\nmost of the great plantations, and superintend the labours of\r\ncultivation and refining.\r\n\r\nIt is this connexion between the Canarians and the inhabitants of\r\nVenezuela, that has given rise to the introduction of camels into\r\nthose provinces. The Marquis del Toro caused three to be brought from\r\nLancerote. The expense of conveyance was very considerable, owing to\r\nthe space which these animals occupy on board merchant-vessels, and\r\nthe great quantity of water they require during a long sea-voyage. A\r\ncamel, bought for thirty piastres, costs between eight and nine\r\nhundred before it reaches the coast of Caracas. We saw four of these\r\nanimals at Mocundo; three of which had been bred in America. Two\r\nothers had died of the bite of the coral, a venomous serpent very\r\ncommon on the banks of the lake. These camels have hitherto been\r\nemployed only in the conveyance of the sugarcanes to the mill. The\r\nmales, stronger than the females, carry from forty to fifty arrobas. A\r\nwealthy landholder in the province of Varinas, encouraged by the\r\nexample of the Marquis del Toro, has allotted a sum of 15,000 piastres\r\nfor the purpose of bringing fourteen or fifteen camels at once from\r\nthe Canary Islands. It is presumed these beasts of burden may be\r\nemployed in the conveyance of merchandise across the burning plains of\r\nCasanare, from the Apure and Calabozo, which in the season of drought\r\nresemble the deserts of Africa. How advantageous it would have been\r\nhad the Conquistadores, from the beginning of the sixteenth century,\r\npeopled America with camels, as they have peopled it with horned\r\ncattle, horses, and mules. Wherever there are immense distances to\r\ncross in uninhabited lands; wherever the construction of canals\r\nbecomes difficult (as in the isthmus of Panama, on the table-land of\r\nMexico, and in the deserts that separate the kingdom of Quito from\r\nPeru, and Peru from Chile), camels would be of the highest importance,\r\nto facilitate inland commerce. It seems the more surprising, that\r\ntheir introduction was not encouraged by the government at the\r\nbeginning of the conquest, as, long after the taking of Grenada,\r\ncamels, for which the Moors had a great predilection, were still very\r\ncommon in the south of Spain. A Biscayan, Juan de Reinaga, carried\r\nsome of these animals at his own expense to Peru. Father Acosta saw\r\nthem at the foot of the Andes, about the end of the sixteenth century;\r\nbut little care being taken of them, they scarcely ever bred, and the\r\nrace soon became extinct. In those times of oppression and cruelty,\r\nwhich have been described as the era of Spanish glory, the\r\ncommendatories (encomenderos) let out the Indians to travellers like\r\nbeasts of burden. They were assembled by hundreds, either to carry\r\nmerchandise across the Cordilleras, or to follow the armies in their\r\nexpeditions of discovery and pillage. The Indians endured this service\r\nmore patiently, because, owing to the almost total want of domestic\r\nanimals, they had long been constrained to perform it, though in a\r\nless inhuman manner, under the government of their own chiefs. The\r\nintroduction of camels attempted by Juan de Reinaga spread an alarm\r\namong the encomenderos, who were, not by law, but in fact, lords of\r\nthe Indian villages. The court listened to the complaints of the\r\nencomenderos; and in consequence America was deprived of one of the\r\nmeans which would have most facilitated inland communication, and the\r\nexchange of productions. Now, however, there is no reason why the\r\nintroduction of camels should not be attempted as a general measure.\r\nSome hundreds of these useful animals, spread over the vast surface of\r\nAmerica, in hot and barren places, would in a few years have a\r\npowerful influence on the public prosperity. Provinces separated by\r\nsteppes would then appear to be brought nearer to each other; several\r\nkinds of inland merchandize would diminish in price on the coast; and\r\nby increasing the number of camels, above all the species called\r\nhedjin, or the ship of the desert, a new life would be given to the\r\nindustry and commerce of the New World.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 22nd we continued our journey from Mocundo by\r\nLos Guayos to the city of Nueva Valencia. We passed a little forest of\r\npalm-trees, which resembled, by their appearance, and their leaves\r\nspread like a fan, the Chamaerops humilis of the coast of Barbary. The\r\ntrunk, however, rises to twenty-four and sometimes thirty feet high.\r\nIt is probably a new species of the genus corypha; and is called in\r\nthe country palma de sombrero, the footstalks of the leaves being\r\nemployed in weaving hats resembling our straw hats. This grove of\r\npalm-trees, the withered foliage of which rustles at the least breath\r\nof air--the camels feeding in the plain--the undulating motion of the\r\nvapours on a soil scorched by the ardour of the sun, give the\r\nlandscape an African aspect. The aridity of the land augments as the\r\ntraveller approaches the town, after passing the western extremity of\r\nthe lake. It is a clayey soil, which has been levelled and abandoned\r\nby the waters. The neighbouring hills, called Los Morros de Valencia,\r\nare composed of white tufa, a very recent limestone formation,\r\nimmediately covering the gneiss. It is again found at Victoria, and on\r\nseveral other points along the chain of the coast. The whiteness of\r\nthis tufa, which reflects the rays of the sun, contributes greatly to\r\nthe excessive heat felt in this place. Everything seems smitten with\r\nsterility; scarcely are a few plants of cacao found on the banks of\r\nthe Rio de Valencia; the rest of the plain is bare, and destitute of\r\nvegetation. This appearance of sterility is here attributed, as it is\r\neverywhere in the valleys of Aragua, to the cultivation of indigo;\r\nwhich, according to the planters, is, of all plants, that which most\r\nexhausts (cansa) the ground. The real physical causes of this\r\nphenomenon would be an interesting inquiry, since, like the effects of\r\nfallowing land, and of a rotation of crops, it is far from being\r\nsufficiently understood. I shall only observe in general, that the\r\ncomplaints of the increasing sterility of cultivated land become more\r\nfrequent between the tropics, in proportion as they are near the\r\nperiod of their first breaking-up. In a region almost destitute of\r\nherbs, where every plant has a ligneous stem, and tends to raise\r\nitself as a shrub, the virgin soil remains shaded either by great\r\ntrees, or by bushes; and under this tufted shade it preserves\r\neverywhere coolness and humidity. However active the vegetation of the\r\ntropics may appear, the number of roots that penetrate into the earth,\r\nis not so great in an uncultivated soil; while the plants are nearer\r\nto each other in lands subjected to cultivation, and covered with\r\nindigo, sugar-canes, or cassava. The trees and shrubs, loaded with\r\nbranches and leaves, draw a great part of their nourishment from the\r\nambient air; and the virgin soil augments its fertility by the\r\ndecomposition of the vegetable substances which progressively\r\naccumulate. It is not so in the fields covered with indigo, or other\r\nherbaceous plants; where the rays of the sun penetrate freely into the\r\nearth, and by the accelerated combustion of the hydrurets of carbon\r\nand other acidifiable principles, destroy the germs of fecundity.\r\nThese effects strike the imagination of the planters the more\r\nforcibly, as in lands newly inhabited they compare the fertility of a\r\nsoil which has been abandoned to itself during thousands of years,\r\nwith the produce of ploughed fields. The Spanish colonies on the\r\ncontinent, and the great islands of Porto-Rico and Cuba, possess\r\nremarkable advantages with respect to the produce of agriculture over\r\nthe lesser West India islands. The former, from their extent, the\r\nvariety of their scenery, and their small relative population, still\r\nbear all the characters of a new soil; while at Barbadoes, Tobago, St.\r\nLucia, the Virgin Islands, and the French part of St. Domingo, it may\r\nbe perceived that long cultivation has begun to exhaust the soil. If\r\nin the valleys of Aragua, instead of abandoning the indigo grounds,\r\nand leaving them fallow, they were covered during several years, not\r\nwith corn, but with other alimentary plants and forage; if among these\r\nplants such as belong to different families were preferred, and which\r\nshade the soil by their large leaves, the amelioration of the fields\r\nwould be gradually accomplished, and they would be restored to a part\r\nof their former fertility.\r\n\r\nThe city of Nueva Valencia occupies a considerable extent of ground,\r\nbut its population scarcely amounts to six or seven thousand souls.\r\nThe streets are very broad, the market place, (plaza mayor,) is of\r\nvast dimensions; and, the houses being low, the disproportion between\r\nthe population of the town, and the space that it occupies, is still\r\ngreater than at Caracas. Many of the whites, (especially the poorest,)\r\nforsake their houses, and live the greater part of the year in their\r\nlittle plantations of indigo and cotton, where they can venture to\r\nwork with their own hands; which, according to the inveterate\r\nprejudices of that country, would be a disgrace to them in the town.\r\n\r\nNueva Valencia, founded in 1555 under the government of Villacinda, by\r\nAlonzo Diaz Moreno, is twelve years older than Caracas. Valencia was\r\nat first only a dependency of Burburata; but this latter town is\r\nnothing now but a place of embarkation for mules. It is regretted, and\r\nperhaps justly, that Valencia has not become the capital of the\r\ncountry. Its situation in a plain, on the banks of a lake, recalls to\r\nmind the position of Mexico. When we reflect on the easy communication\r\nafforded by the valleys of Aragua with the Llanos and the rivers that\r\nflow into the Orinoco; when we recognize the possibility of opening an\r\ninland navigation, by the Rio Pao and the Portuguesa, as far as the\r\nmouths of the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Amazon, it may be\r\nconceived that the capital of the vast provinces of Venezuela would\r\nhave been better placed near the fine harbour of Porto Cabello,\r\nbeneath a pure and serene sky, than near the unsheltered road of La\r\nGuayra, in a temperate but constantly foggy valley. Near the kingdom\r\nof New Grenada, and situate between the fertile corn-lands of La\r\nVictoria and Barquesimeto, the city of Valencia ought to have\r\nprospered; but, notwithstanding these advantages, it has been unable\r\nto maintain the contest with Caracas.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have seen the myriads of ants, that infest the\r\ncountries within the torrid zone, can form an idea of the destruction\r\nand the sinking of the ground occasioned by these insects. They abound\r\nto such a degree on the site of Valencia, that their excavations\r\nresemble subterranean canals, which are filled with water in the time\r\nof the rains, and become very dangerous to the buildings. Here\r\nrecourse has not been had to the extraordinary means employed at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century in the island of St. Domingo, when\r\ntroops of ants ravaged the fine plains of La Vega, and the rich\r\npossessions of the order of St. Francis. The monks, after having in\r\nvain burnt the larvae of the ants, and had recourse to fumigations,\r\nadvised the inhabitants to choose by lot a saint, who would act as a\r\nmediator against the plague of the ants.* (* Un abogado contra los\r\nharmigos.) The honour of the choice fell on St. Saturnin; and the ants\r\ndisappeared as soon as the first festival of this saint was\r\ncelebrated. Incredulity has made great progress since the time of the\r\nconquest; and it was only on the back of the Cordilleras that I found\r\na small chapel, destined, according to its inscription, for prayers to\r\nbe addressed to Heaven for the destruction of the termites.\r\n\r\nValencia affords some historical remembrances; but these, like\r\neverything connected with the colonies, have no remote date, and\r\nrecall to mind either civil discords or sanguinary conflicts with the\r\nsavages. Lopez de Aguirre, whose crimes and adventures form some of\r\nthe most dramatic episodes of the history of the conquest, proceeded\r\nin 1561, from Peru, by the river Amazon to the island of Margareta;\r\nand thence, by the port of Burburata, into the valleys of Aragua. On\r\nhis entrance into Valencia, which proudly entitles itself the City of\r\nthe King, he proclaimed the independence of country, and the\r\ndeposition of Philip II. The inhabitants withdrew to the islands of\r\nthe lake of Tacarigua, taking with them all the boats from the shore,\r\nto be more secure in their retreat. In consequence of this stratagem,\r\nAguirre could exercise his cruelties only on his own people. From\r\nValencia he addressed to the king of Spain, a remarkable letter, in\r\nwhich he boasts alternately of his crimes and his piety; at the same\r\ntime giving advice to the king on the government of the colonies, and\r\nthe system of missions. Surrounded by savage Indians, navigating on a\r\ngreat sea of fresh water, as he calls the Amazon, he is alarmed at the\r\nheresies of Martin Luther, and the increasing influence of schismatics\r\nin Europe.*\r\n\r\n(* The following are some remarkable passages in the letter from\r\nAguirre to the king of Spain.\r\n\r\n\"King Philip, native of Spain, son of Charles the Invincible! I, Lopez\r\nde Aguirre, thy vassal, an old Christian, of poor but noble parents,\r\nand a native of the town of Onate in Biscay, passed over young to\r\nPeru, to labour lance in hand. I rendered thee great services in the\r\nconquest of India. I fought for thy glory, without demanding pay of\r\nthy officers, as is proved by the books of thy treasury. I firmly\r\nbelieve, Christian King and Lord, that, very ungrateful to me and my\r\ncompanions, all those who write to thee from this land [America],\r\ndeceive thee much, because thou seest things from too far off. I\r\nrecommend to thee to be more just toward the good vassals whom thou\r\nhast in this country: for I and mine, weary of the cruelties and\r\ninjustice which thy viceroys, thy governors, and thy judges, exercise\r\nin thy name, are resolved to obey thee no more. We regard ourselves no\r\nlonger as Spaniards. We wage a cruel war against thee, because we will\r\nnot endure the oppression of thy ministers; who, to give places to\r\ntheir nephews and their children, dispose of our lives, our\r\nreputation, and our fortune. I am lame in the left foot from two shots\r\nof an arquebuss, which I received in the valley of Coquimbo, fighting\r\nunder the orders of thy marshal, Alonzo de Alvarado, against Francis\r\nHernandez Giron, then a rebel, as I am at present, and shall be\r\nalways; for since thy viceroy, the Marquis de Canete, a cowardly,\r\nambitious, and effeminate man, has hanged our most valiant warriors, I\r\ncare no more for thy pardon than for the books of Martin Luther. It is\r\nnot well in thee, King of Spain, to be ungrateful toward thy vassals;\r\nfor it was whilst thy father, the emperor Charles, remained quietly in\r\nCastile, that they procured for thee so many kingdoms and vast\r\ncountries. Remember, King Philip, that thou hast no right to draw\r\nrevenues from these provinces, the conquest of which has been without\r\ndanger to thee, but inasmuch as thou recompensest those who have\r\nrendered thee such great services. I am certain that few kings go to\r\nheaven. Therefore we regard ourselves as very happy to be here in the\r\nIndies, preserving in all their purity the commandments of God, and of\r\nthe Roman Church; and we intend, though sinners during life, to become\r\none day martyrs to the glory of God. On going out of the river Amazon,\r\nwe landed in an island called La Margareta. We there received news\r\nfrom Spain of the great faction and machination (maquina) of the\r\nLutherans. This news alarmed us extremely; we found among us one of\r\nthat faction; his name was Monteverde. I had him cut to pieces, as was\r\njust: for, believe me, Senor, wherever I am, people live according to\r\nthe law. But the corruption of morals among the monks is so great in\r\nthis land that it is necessary to chastise it severely. There is not\r\nan ecclesiastic here who does not think himself higher than the\r\ngovernor of a province. I beg of thee, great King, not to believe what\r\nthe monks tell thee down yonder in Spain. They are always talking of\r\nthe sacrifices they make, as well as of the hard and bitter life they\r\nare forced to lead in America: while they occupy the richest lands,\r\nand the Indians hunt and fish for them every day. If they shed tears\r\nbefore thy throne, it is that thou mayest send them hither to govern\r\nprovinces. Dost thou know what sort of life they lead here? Given up\r\nto luxury, acquiring possessions, selling the sacraments, being at\r\nonce ambitious, violent, and gluttonous; such is the life they lead in\r\nAmerica. The faith of the Indians suffer by such bad examples. If thou\r\ndost not change all this, O King of Spain, thy government will not be\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n\"What a misfortune that the Emperor, thy father, should have conquered\r\nGermany at such a price, and spent, on that conquest, the money we\r\nprocured for him in these very Indies! In the year 1559 the Marquis de\r\nCanete sent to the Amazon, Pedro de Ursua, a Navarrese, or rather a\r\nFrenchman: we sailed on the largest rivers of Peru till we came to a\r\ngulf of fresh water. We had already gone three hundred leagues when we\r\nkilled that bad and ambitious captain. We chose a caballero of\r\nSeville, Fernando de Guzman, for king: and we swore fealty to him, as\r\nis done to thyself. I was named quarter-master-general: and because I\r\ndid not consent to all he willed, he wanted to kill me. But I killed\r\nthis new king, the captain of his guards, his lieutenant-general, his\r\nchaplain, a woman, a knight of the order of Rhodes, two ensigns, and\r\nfive or six domestics of the pretended king. I then resolved to punish\r\nthy ministers and thy auditors (counsellors of the audiencia). I named\r\ncaptains and sergeants: these again wanted to kill me, but I had them\r\nall hanged. In the midst of these adventures we navigated for eleven\r\nmonths, till we reached the mouth of the river. We sailed more than\r\nfifteen hundred leagues. God knows how we got through that great mass\r\nof water. I advise thee, O great King, never to send Spanish fleets\r\ninto that accursed river. God preserve thee in his holy keeping.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was given by Aguirre to the vicar of the island of\r\nMargareta, Pedro de Contreras, in order to be transmitted to King\r\nPhilip II. Fray Pedro Simon, Provincial of the Franciscans in New\r\nGrenada, saw several manuscript copies of it both in America and in\r\nSpain. It was printed, for the first time, in 1723, in the History of\r\nthe Province of Venezuela, by Oviedo, volume 1 page 206. Complaints no\r\nless violent, on the conduct of the monks of the 16th century, were\r\naddressed directly to the pope by the Milanese traveller, Girolamo\r\nBenzoni.)\r\n\r\nLopez de Aguirre, or as he is still called by the common people, the\r\nTyrant, was killed at Barquesimeto, after having been abandoned by his\r\nown men. At the moment when he fell, he plunged a dagger into the\r\nbosom of his only daughter, \"that she might not have to blush before\r\nthe Spaniards at the name of the daughter of a traitor.\" The soul of\r\nthe tyrant (such is the belief of the natives) wanders in the\r\nsavannahs, like a flame that flies the approach of men.* (* See volume\r\n1 chapter 1.4.)\r\n\r\nThe second historical event connected with the name of Valencia is the\r\ngreat incursion made by the Caribs of the Orinoco in 1578 and 1580.\r\nThat cannibal horde went up the banks of the Guarico, crossing the\r\nplains or llanos. They were happily repulsed by the valour of Garcia\r\nGonzales, one of the captains whose names are still most revered in\r\nthose provinces. It is gratifying to recollect, that the descendants\r\nof those very Caribs now live in the missions as peaceable husbandmen,\r\nand that no savage nation of Guiana dares to cross the plains which\r\nseparate the region of the forests from that of cultivated land. The\r\nCordillera of the coast is intersected by several ravines, very\r\nuniformly directed from south-east to north-west. This phenomenon is\r\ngeneral from the Quebrada of Tocume, between Petares and Caracas, as\r\nfar as Porto Cabello. It would seem as if the impulsion had everywhere\r\ncome from the south-east; and this fact is the more striking, as the\r\nstrata of gneiss and mica-slate in the Cordillera of the coast are\r\ngenerally directed from the south-west to the north-east. Most of\r\nthese ravines penetrate into the mountains at their southern\r\ndeclivity, without crossing them entirely. But there is an opening\r\n(abra) on the meridian of Nueva Valencia, which leads towards the\r\ncoast, and by which a cooling sea-breeze penetrates every evening into\r\nthe valleys of Aragua. This breeze rises regularly two or three hours\r\nafter sunset.\r\n\r\nBy this abra, the farm of Barbula, and an eastern branch of the\r\nravine, a new road is being constructed from Valencia to Porto\r\nCabello. It will be so short, that it will require only four hours to\r\nreach the port; and the traveller will be able to go and return in the\r\nsame day from the coast to the valleys of Aragua. In order to examine\r\nthis road, we set out on the 26th of February in the evening for the\r\nfarm of Barbula.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 27th we visited the hot springs of La Trinchera,\r\nthree leagues from Valencia. The ravine is very large, and the descent\r\nalmost continual from the banks of the lake to the sea-coast. La\r\nTrinchera takes its name from some fortifications of earth, thrown up\r\nin 1677 by the French buccaneers, who sacked the town of Valencia. The\r\nhot springs (and this is a remarkable geological fact,) do not issue\r\non the south side of the mountains, like those of Mariara, Onoto, and\r\nthe Brigantine; but they issue from the chain itself almost at its\r\nnorthern declivity. They are much more abundant than any we had till\r\nthen seen, forming a rivulet which, in times of the greatest drought,\r\nis two feet deep and eighteen wide. The temperature of the water,\r\nmeasured with great care, was 90.3 degrees of the centigrade\r\nthermometer. Next to the springs of Urijino, in Japan, which are\r\nasserted to be pure water at 100 degrees of temperature, the waters of\r\nthe Trinchera of Porto Cabello appear to be the hottest in the world.\r\nWe breakfasted near the spring; eggs plunged into the water were\r\nboiled in less than four minutes. These waters, strongly charged with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, gush out from the back of a hill rising one\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the bottom of the ravine, and tending\r\nfrom south-south-east to north-north-west. The rock from which the\r\nsprings gush, is a real coarse-grained granite, resembling that of the\r\nRincon del Diablo, in the mountains of Mariara. Wherever the waters\r\nevaporate in the air, they form sediments and incrustations of\r\ncarbonate of lime; possibly they traverse strata of primitive\r\nlimestone, so common in the mica-slate and gneiss of the coasts of\r\nCaracas. We were surprised at the luxuriant vegetation that surrounds\r\nthe basin; mimosas with slender pinnate leaves, clusias, and\r\nfig-trees, have pushed their roots into the bottom of a pool, the\r\ntemperature of which is 85 degrees; and the branches of these trees\r\nextended over the surface of the water, at two or three inches\r\ndistance. The foliage of the mimosas, though constantly enveloped in\r\nthe hot vapours, displayed the most beautiful verdure. An arum, with a\r\nwoody stem, and with large sagittate leaves, rose in the very middle\r\nof a pool the temperature of which was 70 degrees. Plants of the same\r\nspecies vegetate in other parts of those mountains at the brink of\r\ntorrents, the temperature of which is not 18 degrees. What is still\r\nmore singular, forty feet distant from the point whence the springs\r\ngush out at a temperature of 90 degrees, other springs are found\r\nperfectly cold. They all follow for some time a parallel direction;\r\nand the natives showed us that, by digging a hole between the two\r\nrivulets, they could procure a bath of any given temperature they\r\npleased. It seems remarkable, that in the hottest as well as the\r\ncoldest climates, people display the same predilection for heat. On\r\nthe introduction of Christianity into Iceland, the inhabitants would\r\nbe baptized only in the hot springs of Hecla: and in the torrid zone,\r\nin the plains, as well as on the Cordilleras, the natives flock from\r\nall parts to the thermal waters. The sick, who come to La Trinchera to\r\nuse vapour-baths, form a sort of frame-work over the spring with\r\nbranches of trees and very slender reeds. They stretch themselves\r\nnaked on this frame, which appeared to me to possess little strength,\r\nand to be dangerous of access. The Rio de Aguas Calientes runs towards\r\nthe north-east, and becomes, near the coast, a considerable river,\r\nswarming with great crocodiles, and contributing, by its inundations,\r\nto the insalubrity of the shore.\r\n\r\nWe descended towards Porto Cabello, having constantly the river of hot\r\nwater on our right. The road is extremely picturesque, and the waters\r\nroll down on the shelves of rock. We might have fancied we were gazing\r\non the cascades of the Reuss, that flows down Mount St. Gothard; but\r\nwhat a contrast in the vigour and richness of the vegetation! The\r\nwhite trunks of the cecropia rise majestically amid bignonias and\r\nmelastomas. They do not disappear till we are within a hundred toises\r\nabove the level of the ocean. A small thorny palm-tree extends also to\r\nthis limit; the slender pinnate leaves of which look as if they had\r\nbeen curled toward the edges. This tree is very common in these\r\nmountains; but not having seen either its fruit or its flowers, we are\r\nignorant whether it be the piritu palm-tree of the Caribbees, or the\r\nCocos aculeata of Jacquin.\r\n\r\nThe rock on this road presents a geological phenomenon, the more\r\nremarkable as the existence of real stratified granite has long been\r\ndisputed. Between La Trinchera and the Hato de Cambury a\r\ncoarse-grained granite appears, which, from the disposition of the\r\nspangles of mica, collected in small groups, scarcely admits of\r\nconfounding with gneiss, or with rocks of a schistose texture. This\r\ngranite, divided into ledges of two or three feet thick, is directed\r\n52 degrees north-east, and slopes to the north-west regularly at an\r\nangle of from 30 or 40 degrees. The feldspar, crystallized in prisms\r\nwith four unequal sides, about an inch long, passes through every\r\nvariety of tint from a flesh-red to yellowish white. The mica, united\r\nin hexagonal plates, is black, and sometimes green. The quartz\r\npredominates in the mass; and is generally of a milky white. I\r\nobserved neither hornblende, black schorl, nor rutile titanite, in\r\nthis granite. In some ledges we recognised round masses, of a blackish\r\ngray, very quartzose, and almost destitute of mica. They are from one\r\nto two inches diameter; and are found in every zone, in all granite\r\nmountains. These are not imbedded fragments, as at Greiffenstein in\r\nSaxony, but aggregations of particles which seem to have been\r\nsubjected to partial attractions. I could not follow the line of\r\njunction of the gneiss and granitic formations. According to angles\r\ntaken in the valleys of Aragua, the gneiss appears to descend below\r\nthe granite, which must consequently be of a more recent formation.\r\nThe appearance of a stratified granite excited my attention the more,\r\nbecause, having had the direction of the mines of Fichtelberg in\r\nFranconia for several years, I was accustomed to see granites divided\r\ninto ledges of three or four feet thick, but little inclined, and\r\nforming masses like towers, or old ruins, at the summit of the highest\r\nmountains.* (* At Ochsenkopf, at Rudolphstein, at Epprechtstein, at\r\nLuxburg, and at Schneeberg. The dip of the strata of these granites of\r\nFichtelberg is generally only from 6 to 10 degrees, rarely (at\r\nSchneeberg) 18 degrees. According to the dips I observed in the\r\nneighbouring strata of gneiss and mica-slate, I should think that the\r\ngranite of Fichtelberg is very ancient, and serves as a basis for\r\nother formations; but the strata of grunstein, and the disseminated\r\ntin-ore which it contains, may lead us to doubt its great antiquity,\r\nfrom the analogy of the granites of Saxony containing tin.)\r\n\r\nThe heat became stifling as we approached the coast. A reddish vapour\r\nveiled the horizon. It was near sunset, and the breeze was not yet\r\nstirring. We rested in the lonely farms known under the names of the\r\nHato de Cambury and the house of the Canarian (Casa del Isleno). The\r\nriver of hot water, along the banks of which we passed, became deeper.\r\nA crocodile, more than nine feet long, lay dead on the strand. We\r\nwished to examine its teeth, and the inside of its mouth; but having\r\nbeen exposed to the sun for several weeks, it exhaled a smell so fetid\r\nthat we were obliged to relinquish our design and remount our horses.\r\nWhen we arrived at the level of the sea, the road turned eastward, and\r\ncrossed a barren shore a league and a half broad, resembling that of\r\nCumana. We there found some scattered cactuses, a sesuvium, a few\r\nplants of Coccoloba uvifera, and along the coast some avicennias and\r\nmangroves. We forded the Guayguaza and the Rio Estevan, which, by\r\ntheir frequent overflowing, form great pools of stagnant water. Small\r\nrocks of meandrites, madrepores, and other corals, either ramified or\r\nwith a rounded surface, rise in this vast plain, and seem to attest\r\nthe recent retreat of the sea. But these masses, which are the\r\nhabitations of polypi, are only fragments imbedded in a breccia with a\r\ncalcareous cement. I say a breccia, because we must not confound the\r\nfresh and white corallites of this very recent littoral formation,\r\nwith the corallites blended in the mass of transition-rocks,\r\ngrauwacke, and black limestone. We were astonished to find in this\r\nuninhabited spot a large Parkinsonia aculeata loaded with flowers. Our\r\nbotanical works indicate this tree as peculiar to the New World; but\r\nduring five years we saw it only twice in a wild state, once in the\r\nplains of the Rio Guayguaza, and once in the llanos of Cumana, thirty\r\nleagues from the coast, near la Villa del Pao, but there was reason to\r\nbelieve that this latter place had once been a conuco, or cultivated\r\nenclosure. Everywhere else on the continent of America we saw the\r\nParkinsonia, like the Plumeria, only in the gardens of the Indians.\r\n\r\nAt Porto Cabello, as at La Guayra, it is disputed whether the port\r\nlies east or west of the town, with which the communications are the\r\nmost frequent. The inhabitants believe that Porto Cabello is\r\nnorth-north-west of Nueva Valencia; and my observations give a\r\nlongitude of three or four minutes more towards the west.\r\n\r\nWe were received with the utmost kindness in the house of a French\r\nphysician, M. Juliac, who had studied medicine at Montpelier. His\r\nsmall house contained a collection of things the most various, but\r\nwhich were all calculated to interest travellers. We found works of\r\nliterature and natural history; notes on meteorology; skins of the\r\njaguar and of large aquatic serpents; live animals, monkeys,\r\narmadilloes, and birds. Our host was principal surgeon to the royal\r\nhospital of Porto Cabello, and was celebrated in the country for his\r\nskilful treatment of the yellow fever. During a period of seven years\r\nhe had seen six or eight thousand persons enter the hospitals,\r\nattacked by this cruel malady. He had observed the ravages that the\r\nepidemic caused in Admiral Ariztizabal's fleet, in 1793. That fleet\r\nlost nearly a third of its men; for the sailors were almost all\r\nunseasoned Europeans, and held unrestrained intercourse with the\r\nshore. M. Juliac had heretofore treated the sick as was commonly\r\npractised in Terra Firma, and in the island, by bleeding, aperient\r\nmedicines, and acid drinks. In this treatment no attempt was made to\r\nraise the vital powers by the action of stimulants, so that, in\r\nattempting to allay the fever, the languor and debility were\r\naugmented. In the hospitals, where the sick were crowded, the\r\nmortality was often thirty-three per cent among the white Creoles; and\r\nsixty-five in a hundred among the Europeans recently disembarked.\r\nSince a stimulant treatment, the use of opium, of benzoin, and of\r\nalcoholic draughts, has been substituted for the old debilitating\r\nmethod, the mortality has considerably diminished. It was believed to\r\nbe reduced to twenty in a hundred among Europeans, and ten among\r\nCreoles;* even when black vomiting, and haemorrhage from the nose,\r\nears, and gums, indicated a high degree of exacerbation in the malady.\r\n(* I have treated in another work of the proportions of mortality in\r\nthe yellow fever. (Nouvelle Espagne volume 2 pages 777, 785, and 867.)\r\nAt Cadiz the average mortality was, in 1800, twenty per cent; at\r\nSeville, in 1801, it amounted to sixty per cent. At Vera Cruz the\r\nmortality does not exceed twelve or fifteen per cent, when the sick\r\ncan be properly attended. In the civil hospitals of Paris the number\r\nof deaths, one year with another, is from fourteen to eighteen per\r\ncent; but it is asserted that a great number of patients enter the\r\nhospitals almost dying, or at very advanced time of life.) I relate\r\nfaithfully what was then given as the general result of observation:\r\nbut I think, in these numerical comparisons, it must not be forgotten,\r\nthat, notwithstanding appearances, the epidemics of several successive\r\nyears do not resemble each other; and that, in order to decide on the\r\nuse of fortifying or debilitating remedies, (if indeed this difference\r\nexist in an absolute sense,) we must distinguish between the various\r\nperiods of the malady.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Porto Cabello is less ardent than that of La Guayra.\r\nThe breeze there is stronger, more frequent, and more regular. The\r\nhouses do not lean against rocks that absorb the rays of the sun\r\nduring the day, and emit caloric at night, and the air can circulate\r\nmore freely between the coast and the mountains of Ilaria. The causes\r\nof the insalubrity of the atmosphere must be sought in the shores that\r\nextend to the east, as far as the eye can reach, towards the Punta de\r\nTucasos, near the fine port of Chichiribiche. There are situated the\r\nsalt-works; and there, at the beginning of the rainy season, tertian\r\nfevers prevail, and easily degenerate into asthenic fevers. It is\r\naffirmed that the mestizoes who are employed in the salt-works are\r\nmore tawny, and have a yellower skin, when they have suffered several\r\nsuccessive years from those fevers, which are called the malady of the\r\ncoast. The poor fishermen, who dwell on this shore, are of opinion\r\nthat it is not the inundations of the sea, and the retreat of the\r\nsalt-water, which render the lands covered with mangroves so\r\nunhealthful;* (* In the West India Islands all the dreadful maladies\r\nwhich prevail during the wintry season, have been for a long time\r\nattributed to the south winds. These winds convey the emanations of\r\nthe mouths of the Orinoco and of the small rivers of Terra Firma\r\ntoward the high latitudes.) they believe that the insalubrity of the\r\nair is owing to the fresh water, that is, to the overflowings of the\r\nGuayguaza and Estevan, the swell of which is so great and sudden in\r\nthe months of October and November. The banks of the Rio Estevan have\r\nbeen less insalubrious since little plantations of maize and plantains\r\nhave been established; and, by raising and hardening the ground, the\r\nriver has been confined within narrower limits. A plan is formed of\r\ngiving another issue to the Rio San Estevan, and thus to render the\r\nenvirons of Porto Cabello more wholesome. A canal is to lead the\r\nwaters toward that part of the coast which is opposite the island of\r\nGuayguaza.\r\n\r\nThe salt-works of Porto Cabello somewhat resemble those of the\r\npeninsula of Araya, near Cumana. The earth, however, which they\r\nlixivate by collecting the rain-water into small basins, contains less\r\nsalt. It is questioned here, as at Cumana, whether the ground be\r\nimpregnated with saline particles because it has been for ages covered\r\nat intervals with sea-water evaporated by the heat of the sun, or\r\nwhether the soil be muriatiferous, as in a mine very poor in native\r\nsalt. I had not leisure to examine this plain with the same attention\r\nas the peninsula of Araya. Besides, does not this problem reduce\r\nitself to the simple question, whether the salt be owing to new or\r\nvery ancient inundations? The labouring at the salt-works of Porto\r\nCabello being extremely unhealthy, the poorest men alone engage in it.\r\nThey collect the salt in little stores, and afterwards sell it to the\r\nshopkeepers in the town.\r\n\r\nDuring our abode at Porto Cabello, the current on the coast, generally\r\ndirected towards the west,* ran from west to east. This upward current\r\n(corriente por arriba), is very frequent during two or three months of\r\nthe year, from September to November. It is believed to be owing to\r\nsome north-west winds that have blown between Jamaica and Cape St.\r\nAntony in the island of Cuba. (* The wrecks of the Spanish ships,\r\nburnt at the island of Trinidad, at the time of its occupation by the\r\nEnglish in 1797, were carried by the general or rotary current to\r\nPunta Brava, near Porto Cabello. This general current toward the east,\r\nfrom the coasts of Paria to the isthmus of Panama and the western\r\nextremity of the island of Cuba, was the subject of a violent dispute\r\nbetween Don Diego Columbus, Oviedo, and the pilot Andres, in the\r\nsixteenth century.)\r\n\r\nThe military defence of the coasts of Terra Firma rests on six points:\r\nthe castle of San Antonio at Cumana; the Morro of Nueva Barcelona; the\r\nfortifications of La Guayra, (mounting one hundred and thirty-four\r\nguns); Porto Cabello; fort San Carlos, (at the mouth of the lake of\r\nMaracaybo); and Carthagena. Porto Cabello is, next to Carthagena, the\r\nmost important fortified place. The town of Porto Cabello is quite\r\nmodern, and the port is one of the finest in the world. Art has had\r\nscarcely anything to add to the advantages which the nature of the\r\nspot presents. A neck of land stretches first towards the north, and\r\nthen towards the west. Its western extremity is opposite to a range of\r\nislands connected by bridges, and so close together that they might be\r\ntaken for another neck of land. These islands are all composed of a\r\ncalcareous breccia of extremely recent formation, and analagous to\r\nthat on the coast of Cumana, and near the castle of Araya. It is a\r\nconglomerate, containing fragments of madrepores and other corals\r\ncemented by a limestone basis and grains of sand. We had already seen\r\nthis conglomerate near the Rio Guayguaza. By a singular disposition of\r\nthe ground the port resembles a basin or a little inland lake, the\r\nsouthern extremity of which is filled with little islands covered with\r\nmangroves. The opening of the port towards the west contributes much\r\nto the smoothness of the water.* (* It is disputed at Porto Cabello\r\nwhether the port takes its name from the tranquillity of its waters,\r\n\"which would not move a hair (cabello),\" or (which is more probable)\r\nderived from Antonio Cabello, one of the fishermen with whom the\r\nsmugglers of Curacoa had formed a connexion at the period when the\r\nfirst hamlet was constructed on this half-desert coast.) One vessel\r\nonly can enter at a time; but the largest ships of the line can anchor\r\nvery near land to take in water. There is no other danger in entering\r\nthe harbour than the reefs of Punta Brava, opposite which a battery of\r\neight guns has been erected. Towards the west and south-west we see\r\nthe fort, which is a regular pentagon with five bastions, the battery\r\nof the reef, and the fortifications that surround the ancient town,\r\nfounded on an island of a trapezoidal form. A bridge and the fortified\r\ngate of the Staccado join the old to the new town; the latter is\r\nalready larger than the former, though considered only as its suburb.\r\nThe bottom of the basin or lake which forms the harbour of Porto\r\nCabello, turns behind this suburb to the south-west. It is a marshy\r\nground filled with noisome and stagnant water. The town, which has at\r\npresent nearly nine thousand inhabitants, owes its origin to an\r\nillicit commerce, attracted to these shores by the proximity of the\r\ntown of Burburata, which was founded in 1549. It is only since the\r\nadministration of the Biscayans, and of the company of Guipuzcoa, that\r\nPorto Cabello, which was but a hamlet, has been converted into a\r\nwell-fortified town. The vessels of La Guayra, which is less a port\r\nthan a bad open roadstead, come to Porto Cabello to be caulked and\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nThe real defence of the harbour consists in the low batteries on the\r\nneck of land at Punta Brava, and on the reef; but from ignorance of\r\nthis principle, a new fort, the Mirador of Solano* has been\r\nconstructed at a great expense, on the mountains commanding the suburb\r\ntowards the south. (* The Mirador is situate eastward of the Vigia\r\nAlta, and south-east of the battery of the salt-works and the\r\npowder-mill.) More than ten thousand mules are annually exported from\r\nPorto Cabello. It is curious enough to see these animals embarked;\r\nthey are thrown down with ropes, and then hoisted on board the vessels\r\nby means of a machine resembling a crane. Ranged in two files, the\r\nmules with difficulty keep their footing during the rolling and\r\npitching of the ship; and in order to frighten and render them more\r\ndocile, a drum is beaten during a great part of the day and night. We\r\nmay guess what quiet a passenger enjoys, who has the courage to embark\r\nfor Jamaica in a schooner laden with mules.\r\n\r\nWe left Porto Cabello on the first of March, at sunrise. We saw with\r\nsurprise the great number of boats that were laden with fruit to be\r\nsold at the market. It reminded me of a fine morning at Venice. The\r\ntown presents in general, on the side towards the sea, a cheerful and\r\nagreeable aspect. Mountains covered with vegetation, and crowned with\r\npeaks called Las Tetas de Ilaria, which, from their outline would be\r\ntaken for rocks of a trap-formation, form the background of the\r\nlandscape. Near the coast all is bare, white, and strongly illumined,\r\nwhile the screen of mountains is clothed with trees of thick foliage\r\nthat project their vast shadows upon the brown and rocky ground. On\r\ngoing out of the town we visited an aqueduct that had been just\r\nfinished. It is five thousand varas long, and conveys the waters of\r\nthe Rio Estevan by a trench to the town. This work has cost more than\r\nthirty thousand piastres; but its waters gush out in every street.\r\n\r\nWe returned from Porto Cabello to the valleys of Aragua, and stopped\r\nat the Farm of Barbula, near which, a new road to Valencia is in the\r\ncourse of construction. We had heard, several weeks before, of a tree,\r\nthe sap of which is a nourishing milk. It is called the cow-tree; and\r\nwe were assured that the negroes of the farm, who drink plentifully of\r\nthis vegetable milk, consider it a wholesome aliment. All the milky\r\njuices of plants being acrid, bitter, and more or less poisonous, this\r\naccount appeared to us very extraordinary; but we found by experience\r\nduring our stay at Barbula, that the virtues of this tree had not been\r\nexaggerated. This fine tree rises like the broad-leaved star-apple.*\r\n(* Chrysophyllum cainito.) Its oblong and pointed leaves, rough and\r\nalternate, are marked by lateral ribs, prominent at the lower surface,\r\nand parallel. Some of them are ten inches long. We did not see the\r\nflower: the fruit is somewhat fleshy, and contains one and sometimes\r\ntwo nuts. When incisions are made in the trunk of this tree, it yields\r\nabundance of a glutinous milk, tolerably thick, devoid of all\r\nacridity, and of an agreeable and balmy smell. It was offered to us in\r\nthe shell of a calabash. We drank considerable quantities of it in the\r\nevening before we went to bed, and very early in the morning, without\r\nfeeling the least injurious effect. The viscosity of this milk alone\r\nrenders it a little disagreeable. The negroes and the free people who\r\nwork in the plantations drink it, dipping into it their bread of maize\r\nor cassava. The overseer of the farm told us that the negroes grow\r\nsensibly fatter during the season when the palo de vaca furnishes them\r\nwith most milk. This juice, exposed to the air, presents at its\r\nsurface (perhaps in consequence of the absorption of the atmospheric\r\noxygen) membranes of a strongly animalized substance, yellowish,\r\nstringy, and resembling cheese. These membranes, separated from the\r\nrest of the more aqueous liquid, are elastic, almost like caoutchouc;\r\nbut they undergo, in time, the same phenomena of putrefaction as\r\ngelatine. The people call the coagulum that separates by the contact\r\nof the air, cheese. This coagulum grows sour in the space of five or\r\nsix days, as I observed in the small portions which I carried to Nueva\r\nValencia. The milk contained in a stopped phial, had deposited a\r\nlittle coagulum; and, far from becoming fetid, it exhaled constantly a\r\nbalsamic odour. The fresh juice mixed with cold water was scarcely\r\ncoagulated at all; but on the contact of nitric acid the separation of\r\nthe viscous membranes took place. We sent two bottles of this milk to\r\nM. Fourcroy at Paris: in one it was in its natural state, and in the\r\nother, mixed with a certain quantity of carbonate of soda. The French\r\nconsul residing in the island of St. Thomas, undertook to convey them\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary tree of which we have been speaking appears to be\r\npeculiar to the Cordillera of the coast, particularly from Barbula to\r\nthe lake of Maracaybo. Some stocks of it exist near the village of San\r\nMateo; and, according to M. Bredemeyer, whose travels have so much\r\nenriched the fine conservatories of Schonbrunn and Vienna, in the\r\nvalley of Caucagua, three days journey east of Caracas. This\r\nnaturalist found, like us, that the vegetable milk of the palo de vaco\r\nhad an agreeable taste and an aromatic smell. At Caucagua, the natives\r\ncall the tree that furnishes this nourishing juice, the milk-tree\r\n(arbol del leche). They profess to recognize, from the thickness and\r\ncolour of the foliage, the trunks that yield the most juice; as the\r\nherdsman distinguishes, from external signs, a good milch-cow. No\r\nbotanist has hitherto known the existence of this plant. It seems,\r\naccording to M. Kunth, to belong to the sapota family. Long after my\r\nreturn to Europe, I found in the Description of the East Indies by\r\nLaet, a Dutch traveller, a passage that seems to have some relation to\r\nthe cow-tree. \"There exist trees,\" says Laet,* \"in the province of\r\nCumana, the sap of which much resembles curdled milk, and affords a\r\nsalubrious nourishment.\" (* \"Inter arbores quae sponte hic passim\r\nnascuntur, memorantur a scriptoribus Hispanis quaedam quae lacteum\r\nquemdam liquorem fundunt, qui durus admodum evadit instar gummi, et\r\nsuavem odorem de se fundit; aliae quae liquorem quemdam edunt, instar\r\nlactis coagulati, qui in cibis ab ipsis usurpatur sine noxa.\" (Among\r\nthe trees growing here, it is remarked by Spanish writers that there\r\nare some which pour out a milky juice which soon grows solid, like\r\ngum, affording a pleasant odour; and also others that give out a\r\nliquid which coagulates like cheese, and which they eat at meals\r\nwithout any ill effects). Descriptio Indiarum Occidentalium, lib. 18.)\r\n\r\nAmidst the great number of curious phenomena which I have observed in\r\nthe course of my travels, I confess there are few that have made so\r\npowerful an impression on me as the aspect of the cow-tree. Whatever\r\nrelates to milk or to corn, inspires an interest which is not merely\r\nthat of the physical knowledge of things, but is connected with\r\nanother order of ideas and sentiments. We can scarcely conceive how\r\nthe human race could exist without farinaceous substances, and without\r\nthat nourishing juice which the breast of the mother contains, and\r\nwhich is appropriated to the long feebleness of the infant. The\r\namylaceous matter of corn, the object of religious veneration among so\r\nmany nations, ancient and modern, is diffused in the seeds, and\r\ndeposited in the roots of vegetables; milk, which serves as an\r\naliment, appears to us exclusively the produce of animal organization.\r\nSuch are the impressions we have received in our earliest infancy:\r\nsuch is also the source of that astonishment created by the aspect of\r\nthe tree just described. It is not here the solemn shades of forests,\r\nthe majestic course of rivers, the mountains wrapped in eternal snow,\r\nthat excite our emotion. A few drops of vegetable juice recall to our\r\nminds all the powerfulness and the fecundity of nature. On the barren\r\nflank of a rock grows a tree with coriaceous and dry leaves. Its large\r\nwoody roots can scarcely penetrate into the stone. For several months\r\nof the year not a single shower moistens its foliage. Its branches\r\nappear dead and dried; but when the trunk is pierced there flows from\r\nit a sweet and nourishing milk. It is at the rising of the sun that\r\nthis vegetable fountain is most abundant. The negroes and natives are\r\nthen seen hastening from all quarters, furnished with large bowls to\r\nreceive the milk, which grows yellow, and thickens at its surface.\r\nSome empty their bowls under the tree itself; others carry the juice\r\nhome to their children.\r\n\r\nIn examining the physical properties of animal and vegetable products,\r\nscience displays them as closely linked together; but it strips them\r\nof what is marvellous, and perhaps, therefore, of a part of their\r\ncharms. Nothing appears isolated; the chemical principles that were\r\nbelieved to be peculiar to animals are found in plants; a common chain\r\nlinks together all organic nature.\r\n\r\nLong before chemists had recognized small portions of wax in the\r\npollen of flowers, the varnish of leaves, and the whitish dust of our\r\nplums and grapes, the inhabitants of the Andes of Quindiu made tapers\r\nwith the thick layer of wax that covers the trunk of a palm-tree.* (*\r\nCoroxylon andicola.) It is but a few years since we discovered, in\r\nEurope, caseum, the basis of cheese, in the emulsion of almonds; yet\r\nfor ages past, in the mountains of the coast of Venezuela, the milk of\r\na tree, and the cheese separated from that vegetable milk, have been\r\nconsidered as a salutary aliment. How are we to account for this\r\nsingular course in the development of knowledge? How have the\r\nunlearned inhabitants of one hemisphere become cognizant of a fact\r\nwhich, in the other, so long escaped the sagacity of the scientific?\r\nIt is because a small number of elements and principles differently\r\ncombined are spread through several families of plants; it is because\r\nthe genera and species of these natural families are not equally\r\ndistributed in the torrid, the frigid, and the temperate zones; it is\r\nthat tribes, excited by want, and deriving almost all their\r\nsubsistence from the vegetable kingdom, discover nutritive principles,\r\nfarinaceous and alimentary substances, wherever nature has deposited\r\nthem in the sap, the bark, the roots, or the fruits of vegetables.\r\nThat amylaceous fecula which the seeds of the cereal plants furnish in\r\nall its purity, is found united with an acrid and sometimes even\r\npoisonous juice, in the roots of the arums, the Tacca pinnatifida, and\r\nthe Jatropha manihot. The savage of America, like the savage of the\r\nSouth Sea islands, has learned to dulcify the fecula, by pressing and\r\nseparating it from its juice. In the milk of plants, and in the milky\r\nemulsions, matter extremely nourishing, albumen, caseum, and sugar,\r\nare found mixed with caoutchouc and with deleterious and caustic\r\nprinciples, such as morphine and hydrocyanic acid.* (* Opium contains\r\nmorphine, caoutchouc, etc.) These mixtures vary not only in the\r\ndifferent families, but also in the species which belong to the same\r\ngenus. Sometimes it is morphine or the narcotic principle, that\r\ncharacterises the vegetable milk, as in some papaverous plants;\r\nsometimes it is caoutchouc, as in the hevea and the castilloa;\r\nsometimes albumen and caseum, as in the cow-tree.\r\n\r\nThe lactescent plants belong chiefly to the three families of the\r\neuphorbiaceae, the urticeae, and the apocineae.* (* After these three\r\ngreat families follow the papaveraceae, the chicoraceae, the\r\nlobeliaceae, the campanulaceae, the sapoteae, and the cucurbitaceae.\r\nThe hydrocyanic acid is peculiar to the group of rosaceo-amygdalaceae.\r\nIn the monocotyledonous plants there is no milky juice; but the\r\nperisperm of the palms, which yields such sweet and agreeable milky\r\nemulsions, contains, no doubt, caseum. Of what nature is the milk of\r\nmushrooms?) Since, on examining the distribution of vegetable forms\r\nover the globe, we find that those three families are more numerous in\r\nspecies in the low regions of the tropics, we must thence conclude,\r\nthat a very elevated temperature contributes to the elaboration of the\r\nmilky juices, to the formation of caoutchouc, albumen, and caseous\r\nmatter. The sap of the palo de vaca furnishes unquestionably the most\r\nstriking example of a vegetable milk in which the acrid and\r\ndeleterious principle is not united with albumen, caseum, and\r\ncaoutchouc: the genera euphorbia and asclepias, however, though\r\ngenerally known for their caustic properties, already present us with\r\na few species, the juice of which is sweet and harmless. Such are the\r\nTabayba dulce of the Canary Islands, which we have already mentioned,*\r\n(* Euphorbia balsamifera. The milky juice of the Cactus mamillaris is\r\nequally sweet.) and the Asclepias lactifera of Ceylon. Burman relates\r\nthat, in the latter country, when cow's milk is wanting, the milk of\r\nthis asclepias is used; and that the ailments commonly prepared with\r\nanimal milk are boiled with its leaves. It may be possible, as\r\nDecandolle has well observed, that the natives employ only the juice\r\nthat flows from the young plant, at a period when the acrid principle\r\nis not yet developed. In fact, the first shoots of the apocyneous\r\nplants are eaten in several countries.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured by these comparisons to bring into consideration,\r\nunder a more general point of view, the milky juices that circulate in\r\nvegetables; and the milky emulsions that the fruits of the\r\namygdalaceous plants and palms yield. I may be permitted to add the\r\nresult of some experiments which I attempted to make on the juice of\r\nthe Carica papaya during my stay in the valleys of Aragua, though I\r\nwas then almost destitute of chemical tests. The juice has been since\r\nexamined by Vauquelin, and this celebrated chemist has very clearly\r\nrecognized the albumen and caseous matter; he compares the milky sap\r\nto a substance strongly animalized--to the blood of animals; but his\r\nresearches were confined to a fermented juice and a coagulum of a\r\nfetid smell, formed during the passage from the Mauritius to France.\r\nHe has expressed a wish that some traveller would examine the milk of\r\nthe papaw-tree just as it flows from the stem or the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe younger the fruit of the carica, the more milk it yields: it is\r\neven found in the germen scarcely fecundated. In proportion as the\r\nfruit ripens, the milk becomes less abundant, and more aqueous. Less\r\nof that animal matter which is coagulable by acids and by the\r\nabsorption of atmospheric oxygen, is found in it. As the whole fruit\r\nis viscous,* (* The same viscosity is also remarked in the fresh milk\r\nof the palo de vaca. It is no doubt occasioned by the caoutchouc,\r\nwhich is not yet separated, and which forms one mass with the albumen\r\nand the caseum, as the butter and the caseum in animal milk. The juice\r\nof a euphorbiaceous plant (Sapium aucuparium), which also yields\r\ncaoutchouc, is so glutinous that it is used to catch parrots.) it\r\nmight be supposed that, as it grows larger, the coagulable matter is\r\ndeposed in the organs, and forms a part of the pulp, or the fleshy\r\nsubstance. When nitric acid, diluted with four parts of water, is\r\nadded drop by drop to the milk expressed from a very young fruit, a\r\nvery extraordinary phenomenon appears. At the centre of each drop a\r\ngelatinous pellicle is formed, divided by greyish streaks. These\r\nstreaks are simply the juice rendered more aqueous, owing to the\r\ncontact of the acid having deprived it of the albumen. At the same\r\ntime, the centre of the pellicles becomes opaque, and of the colour of\r\nthe yolk of an egg; they enlarge as if by the prolongation of\r\ndivergent fibres. The whole liquid assumes at first the appearance of\r\nan agate with milky clouds; and it seems as if organic membranes were\r\nforming under the eye of the observer. When the coagulum extends to\r\nthe whole mass, the yellow spots again disappear. By agitation it\r\nbecomes granulous like soft cheese.* (* The substance which falls down\r\nin grumous and filamentous clots is not pure caoutchouc, but perhaps a\r\nmixture of this substance with caseum and albumen. Acids precipitate\r\nthe caoutchouc from the milky juice of the euphorbiums, fig-trees, and\r\nhevea; they precipitate the caseum from the milk of animals. A white\r\ncoagulum was formed in phials closely stopped, containing the milk of\r\nthe hevea, and preserved among our collections, during our journey to\r\nthe Orinoco. It is perhaps the development of a vegetable acid which\r\nthen furnishes oxygen to the albumen. The formation of the coagulum of\r\nthe hevea, or of real caoutchouc, is nevertheless much more rapid in\r\ncontact with the air. The absorption of atmospheric oxygen is not in\r\nthe least necessary to the production of butter which exists already\r\nformed in the milk of animals; but I believe it cannot be doubted\r\nthat, in the milk of plants, this absorption produces the pellicles of\r\ncaoutchouc, of coagulated albumen, and of caseum, which are\r\nsuccessively formed in vessels exposed to the open air.) The yellow\r\ncolour reappears on adding a few more drops of nitric acid. The acid\r\nacts in this instance as the oxygen of the atmosphere at a temperature\r\nfrom 27 to 35 degrees; for the white coagulum grows yellow in two or\r\nthree minutes, when exposed to the sun. After a few hours the yellow\r\ncolour turns to brown, no doubt because the carbon is set more free\r\nprogressively as the hydrogen, with which it was combined, is burnt.\r\nThe coagulum formed by the acid becomes viscous, and acquires that\r\nsmell of wax which I have observed in treating muscular flesh and\r\nmushrooms (morels) with nitric acid. According to the fine experiments\r\nof Mr. Hatchett, the albumen may be supposed to pass partly to the\r\nstate of gelatine. The coagulum of the papaw-tree, when newly\r\nprepared, being thrown into water, softens, dissolves in part, and\r\ngives a yellowish tint to the fluid. The milk, placed in contact with\r\nwater only, forms also membranes. In an instant a tremulous jelly is\r\nprecipitated, resembling starch. This phenomenon is particularly\r\nstriking if the water employed be heated to 40 or 60 degrees. The\r\njelly condenses in proportion as more water is poured upon it. It\r\npreserves a long time its whiteness, only growing yellow by the\r\ncontact of a few drops of nitric acid. Guided by the experiments of\r\nFourcroy and Vauquelin on the juice of the hevea, I mixed a solution\r\nof carbonate of soda with the milk of the papaw. No clot is formed,\r\neven when pure water is poured on a mixture of the milk with the\r\nalkaline solution. The membranes appear only when, by adding an acid,\r\nthe soda is neutralized, and the acid is in excess. I made the\r\ncoagulum formed by nitric acid, the juice of lemons, or hot water,\r\nlikewise disappear by mixing it with carbonate of soda. The sap again\r\nbecomes milky and liquid, as in its primitive state; but this\r\nexperiment succeeds only when the coagulum has been recently formed.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the milky juices of the papaw, the cow-tree, and the\r\nhevea, there appears a striking analogy between the juices which\r\nabound in caseous matter, and those in which caoutchouc prevails. All\r\nthe white and newly prepared caoutchouc, as well as the waterproof\r\ncloaks, manufactured in Spanish America by placing a layer of milk of\r\nhevea between two pieces of cloth, exhale an animal and nauseating\r\nsmell. This seems to indicate that the caoutchouc, in coagulating,\r\ncarries with it the caseum, which is perhaps only an altered albumen.\r\n\r\nThe produce of the bread-fruit tree can no more be considered as bread\r\nthan plantains before the state of maturity, or the tuberous and\r\namylaceous roots of the cassava, the dioscorea, the Convolvulus\r\nbatatas, and the potato. The milk of the cow-tree contains, on the\r\ncontrary, a caseous matter, like the milk of mammiferous animals.\r\nAdvancing to more general considerations, we may regard, with M.\r\nGay-Lussac, the caoutchouc as the oily part--the butter of vegetable\r\nmilk. We find in the milk of plants caseum and caoutchouc; in the milk\r\nof animals, caseum and butter. The proportions of the two albuminous\r\nand oily principles differ in the various species of animals and of\r\nlactescent plants. In these last they are most frequently mixed with\r\nother substances hurtful as food; but of which the separation might\r\nperhaps be obtained by chemical processes. A vegetable milk becomes\r\nnourishing when it is destitute of acrid and narcotic principles; and\r\nabounds less in caoutchouc than in caseous matter.*\r\n\r\n(* The milk of the lactescent agarics has not been separately\r\nanalysed; it contains an acrid principle in the Agaricus piperatus,\r\nand in other species it is sweet and harmless. The experiments of MM.\r\nBraconnot, Bouillon-Lagrange, and Vauquelin (Annales de Chimie, volume\r\n46, volume 51, volume 79, volume 80, volume 85, have pointed out a\r\ngreat quantity of albumen in the substance of the Agaricus deliciosus,\r\nan edible mushroom. It is this albumen contained in their juice which\r\nrenders them so hard when boiled. It has been proved that morels\r\n(Morchella esculenta) can be converted into sebaceous and adipocerous\r\nmatter, capable of being used in the fabrication of soap. (De\r\nCandolle, sur les Proprietes medicinales des Plantes.) Saccharine\r\nmatter has also been found in mushrooms by Gunther. It is in the\r\nfamily of the fungi, more especially in the clavariae, phalli,\r\nhelvetiae, the merulii, and the small gymnopae which display\r\nthemselves in a few hours after a storm of rain, that organic nature\r\nproduces with most rapidity the greatest variety of chemical\r\nprinciples--sugar, albumen, adipocire, acetate of potash, fat,\r\nozmazome, the aromatic principles, etc. It would be interesting to\r\nexamine, besides the milk of the lactescent fungi, those species\r\nwhich, when cut in pieces, change their colour on the contact of\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nThough we have referred the palo de vaca to the family of the sapotas,\r\nwe have nevertheless found in it a great resemblance to some plants of\r\nthe urticeous kind, especially to the fig-tree, because of its\r\nterminal stipulae in the shape of a horn; and to the brosimum, on\r\naccount of the structure of its fruit. M. Kunth would even have\r\npreferred this last classification; if the description of the fruit,\r\nmade on the spot, and the nature of the milk, which is acrid in the\r\nurticeae, and sweet in the sapotas, did not seem to confirm our\r\nconjecture. Bredemeyer saw, like us, the fruit, and not the flower of\r\nthe cow tree. He asserts that he observed [sometimes?] two seeds,\r\nlying one against the other, as in the alligator pear-tree (Laurus\r\npersea). Perhaps this botanist had the intention of expressing the\r\nsame conformation of the nucleus that Swartz indicates in the\r\ndescription of the brosimum--\"nucleus bilobus aut bipartibilis.\" We\r\nhave mentioned the places where this remarkable tree grows: it will be\r\neasy for botanical travellers to procure the flower of the palo de\r\nvaca and to remove the doubts which still remain, of the family to\r\nwhich it belongs.)\r\n\r\nWhilst the palo de vaca manifests the immense fecundity and the bounty\r\nof nature in the torrid zone, it also reminds us of the numerous\r\ncauses which favour in those fine climates the careless indolence of\r\nman. Mungo Park has made known the butter-tree of Bambarra, which M.\r\nDe Candolle suspects to be of the family of sapotas, as well as our\r\nmilk-tree. The plantain, the sago-tree, and the mauritia of the\r\nOrinoco, are as much bread-trees as the rema of the South Sea. The\r\nfruits of the crescentia and the lecythis serve as vessels for\r\ncontaining food, while the spathes of the palms, and the bark of\r\ntrees, furnish caps and garments without a seam. The knots, or rather\r\nthe interior cells of the trunks of bamboos, supply ladders, and\r\nfacilitate in a thousand ways the construction of a hut, and the\r\nfabrication of chairs, beds, and other articles of furniture that\r\ncompose the wealth of a savage household. In the midst of this lavish\r\nvegetation, so varied in its productions, it requires very powerful\r\nmotives to excite man to labour, to rouse him from his lethargy, and\r\nto unfold his intellectual faculties.\r\n\r\nCacao and cotton are cultivated at Barbula. We there found, what is\r\nvery rare in that country, two large cylindrical machines for\r\nseparating the cotton from its seed; one put in motion by an hydraulic\r\nwheel, and the other by a wheel turned by mules. The overseer of the\r\nfarm, who had constructed these machines, was a native of Merida. He\r\nwas acquainted with the road that leads from Nueva Valencia, by the\r\nway of Guanare and Misagual, to Varinas; and thence by the ravine of\r\nCollejones, to the Paramo de Mucuchies and the mountains of Merida\r\ncovered with eternal snows. The notions he gave us of the time\r\nrequisite for going from Valencia by Varinas to the Sierra Nevada, and\r\nthence by the port of Torunos, and the Rio Santo Domingo, to San\r\nFernando de Apure, were of infinite value to us. It can scarcely be\r\nimagined in Europe, how difficult it is to obtain accurate information\r\nin a country where the communications are so rare; and where distances\r\nare diminished or exaggerated according to the desire that may be felt\r\nto encourage the traveller, or to deter him from his purpose. I had\r\nresolved to visit the eastern extremity of the Cordilleras of New\r\nGrenada, where they lose themselves in the paramos of Timotes and\r\nNiquitao. I learned at Barbula, that this excursion would retard our\r\narrival at the Orinoco thirty-five days. This delay appeared to us so\r\nmuch the longer, as the rains were expected to begin sooner than\r\nusual. We had the hope of examining afterwards a great number of\r\nmountains covered with perpetual snow, at Quito, Peru, and Mexico; and\r\nit appeared to me still more prudent to relinquish our project of\r\nvisiting the mountains of Merida, since by so doing we might miss the\r\nreal object of our journey, that of ascertaining by astronomical\r\nobservations the point of communication between the Orinoco, the Rio\r\nNegro, and the river Amazon. We returned in consequence from Barbula\r\nto Guacara, to take leave of the family of the Marquis del Toro, and\r\npass three days more on the borders of the lake.\r\n\r\nIt was the carnival season, and all was gaiety. The sports in which\r\nthe people indulge, and which are called carnes tollendas,* assume\r\noccasionally somewhat of a savage character. (* Or \"farewell to\r\nflesh.\" The word carnival has the same meaning, these sports being\r\nalways held just before the commencement of Lent.) Some led an ass\r\nloaded with water, and, where-ever they found a window open, inundated\r\nthe apartment within by means of a pump. Others carried bags filled\r\nwith hairs of picapica;* (* Dolichos pruriens (cowage).) and blew the\r\nhair, which causes a great irritation of the skin, into the faces of\r\nthose who passed by.\r\n\r\nFrom Guacara we returned to Nueva Valencia. We found there a few\r\nFrench emigrants, the only ones we saw during five years passed in the\r\nSpanish colonies. Notwithstanding the ties of blood which unite the\r\nroyal families of France and Spain, even French priests were not\r\npermitted to take refuge in that part of the New World, where man with\r\nsuch facility finds food and shelter. Beyond the Atlantic, the United\r\nStates of America afford the only asylum to misfortune. A government,\r\nstrong because it is free, confiding because it is just, has nothing\r\nto fear in giving refuge to the proscribed.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured above to give some notions of the state of the\r\ncultivation of indigo, cotton, and sugar, in the province of Caracas.\r\nBefore we quit the valley of Aragua and its neighbouring coast, it\r\nremains for us to speak of the cacao-plantations, which have at all\r\ntimes been considered as the principal source of the prosperity of\r\nthose countries. The province of Caracas,* (* The province, not the\r\ncapitania-general, consequently not including the cacao plantations of\r\nCumana, the province of Barcelona, of Maracaybo, of Varinas, and of\r\nSpanish Guiana.) at the end of the eighteenth century, produced\r\nannually a hundred and fifty thousand fanegas, of which a hundred\r\nthousand were consumed in Spain, and thirty thousand in the province.\r\nEstimating a fanega of cacao at only twenty-five piastres for the\r\nprice given at Cadiz, we find that the total value of the exportation\r\nof cacao, by the six ports of the Capitania General of Caracas,\r\namounts to four million eight hundred thousand piastres. So important\r\nan object of commerce merits a careful discussion; and I flatter\r\nmyself, that, from the great number of materials I have collected on\r\nall the branches of colonial agriculture, I shall be able to add\r\nsomething to the information published by M. Depons, in his valuable\r\nwork on the provinces of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThe tree which produces the cacao is not at present found wild in the\r\nforests of Terra Firma to the north of the Orinoco; we began to find\r\nit only beyond the cataracts of Ature and Maypure. It abounds\r\nparticularly near the banks of the Ventuari, and on the Upper Orinoco,\r\nbetween the Padamo and the Gehette. This scarcity of wild cacao-trees\r\nin South America, north of the latitude of 6 degrees, is a very\r\ncurious phenomenon of botanical geography, and yet little known. This\r\nphenomenon appears the more surprising, as, according to the annual\r\nproduce of the harvest, the number of trees in full bearing in the\r\ncacao-plantations of Caracas, Nueva Barcelona, Venezuela, Varinas, and\r\nMaracaybo, is estimated at more than sixteen millions. The wild\r\ncacao-tree has many branches, and is covered with a tufted and dark\r\nfoliage. It bears a very small fruit, like that variety which the\r\nancient Mexicans called tlalcacahuatl. Transplanted into the conucos\r\nof the Indians of Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro, the wild tree\r\npreserves for several generations that force of vegetable life, which\r\nmakes it bear fruit in the fourth year; while, in the province of\r\nCaracas, the harvest begins only the sixth, seventh, or eighth year.\r\nIt is later in the inland parts than on the coasts and in the valley\r\nof Guapo. We met with no tribe on the Orinoco that prepared a beverage\r\nwith the seeds of the cacao-tree. The savages suck the pulp of the\r\npod, and throw away the seeds, which are often found in heaps where\r\nthey have passed the night. Though chorote, which is a very weak\r\ninfusion of cacao, is considered on the coast to be a very ancient\r\nbeverage, no historical fact proves that chocolate, or any preparation\r\nwhatever of cacao, was known to the natives of Venezuela before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards. It appears to me more probable that the\r\ncacao-plantations of Caracas were suggested by those of Mexico and\r\nGuatimala; and that the Spaniards inhabiting Terra Firma learned the\r\ncultivation of the cacao-tree, sheltered in its youth by the foliage\r\nof the erythrina and plantain;* (This process of the Mexican\r\ncultivators, practised on the coast of Caracas, is described in the\r\nmemoirs known under the title of \"Relazione di certo Gentiluomo del\r\nSignor Cortez, Conquistadore del Messico.\" (Ramusio, tome 2 page\r\n134).) the fabrication of cakes of chocolatl, and the use of the\r\nliquid of the same name, in course of their communications with\r\nMexico, Guatimala, and Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nDown to the sixteenth century travellers differed in opinion\r\nrespecting the chocolatl. Benzoni plainly says that it is a drink\r\n\"fitter for hogs than men.\"* (* Benzoni, Istoria del Mondo Nuovo, 1572\r\npage 104.) The Jesuit Acosta asserts, that \"the Spaniards who inhabit\r\nAmerica are fond of chocolate to excess; but that it requires to be\r\naccustomed to that black beverage not to be disgusted at the mere\r\nsight of its froth, which swims on it like yeast on a fermented\r\nliquor.\" He adds, \"the cacao is a prejudice (una supersticion) of the\r\nMexicans, as the coca is a prejudice of the Peruvians.\" These opinions\r\nremind us of Madame de Sevigne's prediction respecting the use of\r\ncoffee. Fernando Cortez and his page, the gentilhombre del gran\r\nConquistador, whose memoirs were published by Ramusio, on the\r\ncontrary, highly praise chocolate, not only as an agreeable drink,\r\nthough prepared cold,* but in particular as a nutritious substance. (*\r\nFather Gili has very clearly shown, from two passages in Torquemada\r\n(Monarquia Indiana, lib. 14) that the Mexicans prepared the infusion\r\ncold, and that the Spaniards introduced the custom of preparing\r\nchocolate by boiling water with the paste of cacao.) \"He who has drunk\r\none cup,\" says the page of Fernando Cortez, \"can travel a whole day\r\nwithout any other food, especially in very hot climates; for chocolate\r\nis by its nature cold and refreshing.\" We shall not subscribe to the\r\nlatter part of this assertion; but we shall soon have occasion, in our\r\nvoyage on the Orinoco, and our excursions towards the summit of the\r\nCordilleras, to celebrate the salutary properties of chocolate. It is\r\neasily conveyed and readily employed: as an aliment it contains a\r\nlarge quantity of nutritive and stimulating particles in a small\r\ncompass. It has been said with truth, that in the East, rice, gum, and\r\nghee (clarified butter), assist man in crossing the deserts; and so,\r\nin the New World, chocolate and the flour of maize, have rendered\r\naccessible to the traveller the table-lands of the Andes, and vast\r\nuninhabited forests.\r\n\r\nThe cacao harvest is extremely variable. The tree vegetates with such\r\nvigour that flowers spring out even from the roots, wherever the earth\r\nleaves them uncovered. It suffers from the north-east winds, even when\r\nthey lower the temperature only a few degrees. The heavy showers that\r\nfall irregularly after the rainy season, during the winter months,\r\nfrom December to March, are also very hurtful to the cacao-tree. The\r\nproprietor of a plantation of fifty thousand trees often loses the\r\nvalue of more than four or five thousand piastres in cacao in one\r\nhour. Great humidity is favourable to the tree only when it augments\r\nprogressively, and is for a long time uninterrupted. If, in the season\r\nof drought, the leaves and the young fruit be wetted by a violent\r\nshower, the fruit falls from the stem; for it appears that the vessels\r\nwhich absorb water break from being rendered turgid. Besides, the\r\ncacao-harvest is one of the most uncertain, on account of the fatal\r\neffects of inclement seasons, and the great number of worms, insects,\r\nbirds, and quadrupeds,* (* Parrots, monkeys, agoutis, squirrels, and\r\nstags.) which devour the pod of the cacao-tree; and this branch of\r\nagriculture has the disadvantage of obliging the new planter to wait\r\neight or ten years for the fruit of his labours, and of yielding after\r\nall an article of very difficult preservation.\r\n\r\nThe finest plantations of cacao are found in the province of Caracas,\r\nalong the coast, between Caravalleda and the mouth of the Rio Tocuyo,\r\nin the valleys of Caucagua, Capaya, Curiepe, and Guapo; and in those\r\nof Cupira, between cape Conare and cape Unare, near Aroa,\r\nBarquesimeto, Guigue, and Uritucu. The cacao that grows on the banks\r\nof the Uritucu, at the entrance of the llanos, in the jurisdiction of\r\nSan Sebastian de las Reyes, is considered to be of the finest quality.\r\nNext to the cacao of Uritucu comes that of Guigue, of Caucagua, of\r\nCapaya, and of Cupira. The merchants of Cadiz assign the first rank to\r\nthe cacao of Caracas, immediately after that of Socomusco; and its\r\nprice is generally from thirty to forty per cent higher than that of\r\nGuayaquil.\r\n\r\nIt is only since the middle of the seventeenth century, when the\r\nDutch, tranquil possessors of the island of Curacoa, awakened, by\r\ntheir smuggling, the agricultural industry of the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbouring coasts, that cacao has become an object of exportation in\r\nthe province of Caracas. We are ignorant of everything that passed in\r\nthose countries before the establishment of the Biscay Company of\r\nGuipuzcoa, in 1728. No precise statistical data have reached us: we\r\nonly know that the exportation of cacao from Caracas scarcely\r\namounted, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, to thirty\r\nthousand fanegas a-year. From 1730 to 1748, the company sent to Spain\r\neight hundred and fifty-eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight\r\nfanegas, which make, on an average, forty-seven thousand seven hundred\r\nfanegas a-year; the price of the fanega fell, in 1732, to forty-five\r\npiastres, when it had before kept at eighty piastres. In 1763 the\r\ncultivation had so much augmented, that the exportation rose to eighty\r\nthousand six hundred and fifty-nine fanegas.\r\n\r\nIn an official document, taken from the papers of the minister of\r\nfinance, the annual produce (la cosecha) of the province of Caracas is\r\nestimated at a hundred and thirty-five thousand fanegas of cacao;\r\nthirty-three thousand of which are for home consumption, ten thousand\r\nfor other Spanish colonies, seventy-seven thousand for the\r\nmother-country, fifteen thousand for the illicit commerce with the\r\nFrench, English, Dutch, and Danish colonies. From 1789 to 1793, the\r\nimportation of cacao from Caracas into Spain was, on an average,\r\nseventy-seven thousand seven hundred and nineteen fanegas a-year, of\r\nwhich sixty-five thousand seven hundred and sixty-six were consumed in\r\nthe country, and eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three exported\r\nto France, Italy, and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe late wars have had much more fatal effects on the cacao trade of\r\nCaracas than on that of Guayaquil. On account of the increase of\r\nprice, less cacao of the first quality has been consumed in Europe.\r\nInstead of mixing, as was done formerly for common chocolate, one\r\nquarter of the cacao of Caracas, with three-quarters of that of\r\nGuayaquil, the latter has been employed pure in Spain. We must here\r\nremark, that a great deal of cacao of an inferior quality, such as\r\nthat of Maranon, the Rio Negro, Honduras, and the island of St. Lucia,\r\nbears the name, in commerce, of Guayaquil cacao. The exportation from\r\nthat port amounts only to sixty thousand fanegas; consequently it is\r\ntwo-thirds less than that of the ports of the Capitania-General of\r\nCaracas.\r\n\r\nThough the plantations of cacao have augmented in the provinces of\r\nCumana, Barcelona, and Maracaybo, in proportion as they have\r\ndiminished in the province of Caracas, it is still believed that, in\r\ngeneral, this ancient branch of agricultural industry gradually\r\ndeclines. In many parts coffee and cotton-trees progressively take\r\nplace of the cacao, of which the lingering harvests weary the patience\r\nof the cultivator. It is also asserted, that the new plantations of\r\ncacao are less productive than the old; the trees do not acquire the\r\nsame vigour, and yield later and less abundant fruit. The soil is\r\nstill said to be exhausted; but probably it is rather the atmosphere\r\nthat is changed by the progress of clearing and cultivation. The air\r\nthat reposes on a virgin soil covered with forests is loaded with\r\nhumidity and those gaseous mixtures that serve for the nutriment of\r\nplants, and arise from the decomposition of organic substances. When a\r\ncountry has been long subjected to cultivation, it is not the\r\nproportions between the azote and oxygen that vary. The constituent\r\nbases of the atmosphere remain unaltered; but it no longer contains,\r\nin a state of suspension, those binary and ternary mixtures of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen, which a virgin soil exhales, and which are\r\nregarded as a source of fecundity. The air, purer and less charged\r\nwith miasmata and heterogeneous emanations, becomes at the same time\r\ndrier. The elasticity of the vapours undergoes a sensible diminution.\r\nOn land long cleared, and consequently little favourable to the\r\ncultivation of the cacao-tree (as, for instance, in the West India\r\nIslands), the fruit is almost as small as that of the wild cacao-tree.\r\nIt is on the banks of the Upper Orinoco, after having crossed the\r\nLlanos, that we find the true country of the cacao-tree; thick\r\nforests, in which, on a virgin soil, and surrounded by an atmosphere\r\ncontinually humid, the trees furnish, from the fourth year, abundant\r\ncrops. Wherever the soil is not exhausted, the fruit has become by\r\ncultivation larger and bitter, but also later.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the produce of cacao gradually diminish in Terra Firma, it\r\nmay be inquired, whether the consumption will diminish in the same\r\nproportion in Spain, Italy, and the rest of Europe; or whether it be\r\nnot probable, that by the destruction of the cacao plantations, the\r\nprice will augment sufficiently to rouse anew the industry of the\r\ncultivator. This latter opinion is generally admitted by those who\r\ndeplore, at Caracas, the diminution of so ancient and profitable a\r\nbranch of commerce. In proportion as civilization extends towards the\r\nhumid forests of the interior, the banks of the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazon, or towards the valleys that furrow the eastern declivity of\r\nthe Andes, the new planters will find lands and an atmosphere equally\r\nfavourable to the culture of the cacao-tree.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, in general, dislike a mixture of vanilla with the\r\ncacao, as irritating the nervous system; the fruit, therefore, of that\r\norchideous plant is entirely neglected in the province of Caracas,\r\nthough abundant crops of it might be gathered on the moist and\r\nfeverish coast between Porto Cabello and Ocumare; especially at\r\nTuriamo, where the fruits of the Epidendrum vanilla attain the length\r\nof eleven or twelve inches. The English and the Anglo-Americans often\r\nseek to make purchases of vanilla at the port of La Guayra, but the\r\nmerchants procure with difficulty a very small quantity. In the\r\nvalleys that descend from the chain of the coast towards the Caribbean\r\nSea, in the province of Truxillo, as well as in the Missions of\r\nGuiana, near the cataracts of the Orinoco, a great quantity of vanilla\r\nmight be collected; the produce of which would be still more abundant,\r\nif, according to the practice of the Mexicans, the plant were\r\ndisengaged, from time to time, from the creeping plants by which it is\r\nentwined and stifled.\r\n\r\nThe hot and fertile valleys of the Cordillera of the coast of\r\nVenezuela occupy a tract of land which, on the west, towards the lake\r\nof Maracaybo, displays a remarkable variety of scenery. I shall\r\nexhibit in one view, to close this chapter, the facts I have been able\r\nto collect respecting the quality of the soil and the metallic riches\r\nof the districts of Aroa, of Barquesimeto, and of Carora.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sierra Nevada of Merida, and the paramos of Niquitao, Bocono,\r\nand Las Rosas,* (Many travellers, who were monks, have asserted that\r\nthe little Paramo de Las Rosas, the height of which appears to be more\r\nthan 1,600 toises, is covered with rosemary, and the red and white\r\nroses of Europe grow wild there. These roses are gathered to decorate\r\nthe altars in the neighbouring villages on the festivals of the\r\nchurch. By what accident has our Rosa centifolia become wild in this\r\ncountry, while we nowhere found it in the Andes of Quito and Peru? Can\r\nit really be the rose-tree of our garden?) which contain the valuable\r\nbark-tree, the eastern Cordillera of New Granada* (* The bark exported\r\nfrom the port of Maracaybo does not come from the territory of\r\nVenezuela, but from the mountains of Pamplona in New Grenada, being\r\nbrought down the Rio de San Faustino, that flows into the lake of\r\nMaracaybo. (Pombo, Noticias sobre las Quinas, 1814 page 65.) Some is\r\ncollected near Merida, in the ravine of Viscucucuy.) decreases in\r\nheight so rapidly, that, between the ninth and tenth degrees of\r\nlatitude, it forms only a chain of little mountains, which, stretching\r\nto the north-east by the Altar and Torito, separates the rivers that\r\njoin the Apure and the Orinoco from those numerous rivers that flow\r\neither into the Caribbean Sea or the lake of Maracaybo. On this\r\ndividing ridge are built the towns of Nirgua, San Felipe el Fuerte,\r\nBarquesimeto, and Tocuyo. The first three are in a very hot climate;\r\nbut Tocuyo enjoys great coolness, and we heard with surprise, that,\r\nbeneath so fine a sky, the inhabitants have a strong propensity to\r\nsuicide. The ground rises towards the south; for Truxillo, the lake of\r\nUrao, from which carbonate of soda is extracted, and La Grita, all to\r\nthe east of the Cordillera, though no farther distant, are four or\r\nfive hundred toises high.\r\n\r\nOn examining the law which the primitive strata of the Cordillera of\r\nthe coast follow in their dip, we believe we recognize one of the\r\ncauses of the extreme humidity of the land bounded by this Cordillera\r\nand the ocean. The dip of the strata is most frequently to the\r\nnorth-west; so that the waters flow in that direction on the ledges of\r\nrock; and form, as we have stated above, that multitude of torrents\r\nand rivers, the inundations of which become so fatal to the health of\r\nthe inhabitants, from cape Codera as far as the lake of Maracaybo.\r\n\r\nAmong the rivers which descend north-east toward the coast of Porto\r\nCabello, and La Punta de Hicacos, the most remarkable are those of\r\nTocuyo, Aroa, and Yaracuy. Were it not for the miasmata which infect\r\nthe atmosphere, the valleys of Aroa and of Yaracuy would perhaps be\r\nmore populous than those of Aragua. Navigable rivers would even give\r\nthe former the advantage of facilitating the exportation of their own\r\ncrops of sugar and cacao, and that of the productions of the\r\nneighbouring lands; as the wheat of Quibor, the cattle of Monai, and\r\nthe copper of Aroa. The mines from which this copper is extracted, are\r\nin a lateral valley, opening into that of Aroa; and which is less hot,\r\nand less unhealthy, than the ravines nearer the sea. In the latter the\r\nIndians have their gold-washings, and the soil conceals rich\r\ncopper-ores, which no one has yet attempted to extract. The ancient\r\nmines of Aroa, after having been long neglected, have been wrought\r\nanew by the care of Don Antonio Henriquez, whom we met at San Fernando\r\non the borders of the Apure. The total produce of metallic copper is\r\ntwelve or fifteen hundred quintals a year. This copper, known at Cadiz\r\nby the name of Caracas copper, is of excellent quality. It is even\r\npreferred to that of Sweden, and of Coquimbo in Chile. Part of the\r\ncopper of Aroa is employed for making bells, which are cast on the\r\nspot. Some ores of silver have been recently discovered between Aroa\r\nand Nirgua, near Guanita, in the mountain of San Pablo. Grains of gold\r\nare found in all the mountainous lands between the Rio Yaracuy, the\r\ntown of San Felipe, Nirgua, and Barquesimeto; particularly in the Rio\r\nde Santa Cruz, in which the Indian gold-gatherers have sometimes found\r\nlumps of the value of four or five piastres. Do the neighbouring rocks\r\nof mica-slate and gneiss contain veins? or is the gold disseminated\r\nhere, as in the granites of Guadarama in Spain, and of the Fichtelberg\r\nin Franconia, throughout the whole mass of the rock? Possibly the\r\nwaters, in filtering through it, bring together the disseminated\r\ngrains of gold; in which case every attempt to work the rock would be\r\nuseless. In the Savana de la Miel, near the town of Barquesimeto, a\r\nshaft has been sunk in a black shining slate resembling ampelite. The\r\nminerals extracted from this shaft, which were sent to me at Caracas,\r\nwere quartz, non-auriferous pyrites, and carbonated lead, crystallized\r\nin needles of a silky lustre.\r\n\r\nIn the early times of the conquest the working of the mines of Nirgua\r\nand of Buria* was begun, notwithstanding the incursions of the warlike\r\nnation of the Giraharas. (* The valley of Buria, and the little river\r\nof the same name, communicate with the valley of the Rio Coxede, or\r\nthe Rio de Barquesimeto.) In this very district the accumulation of\r\nnegro slaves in 1553 gave rise to an event bearing some analogy to the\r\ninsurrection in St. Domingo. A negro slave excited an insurrection\r\namong the miners of the Real de San Felipe de Buria. He retired into\r\nthe woods, and founded, with two hundred of his companions, a town,\r\nwhere he was proclaimed king. Miguel, this new king, was a friend to\r\npomp and parade. He caused his wife Guiomar, to assume the title of\r\nqueen; and, according to Oviedo, he appointed ministers and\r\ncounsellors of state, officers of the royal household, and even a\r\nnegro bishop. He soon after ventured to attack the neighbouring town\r\nof Nueva Segovia de Barquesimeto; but, being repulsed by Diego de\r\nLosada, he perished in the conflict. This African monarchy was\r\nsucceeded at Nirgua by a republic of Zamboes, the descendants of\r\nnegroes and Indians. The whole municipality (cabildo) is composed of\r\nmen of colour to whom the king of Spain has given the title of \"his\r\nfaithful and loyal subjects, the Zamboes of Nirgua.\" Few families of\r\nWhites will inhabit a country where the system of government is so\r\nadverse to their pretensions; and the little town is called in\r\nderision La republica de Zambos y Mulatos.\r\n\r\nIf the hot valleys of Aroa, of Yaracuy, and of the Rio Tocuyo,\r\ncelebrated for their excellent timber, be rendered feverish by\r\nluxuriance of vegetation, and extreme atmospheric humidity, it is\r\ndifferent in the savannahs of Monai and Carora. These Llanos are\r\nseparated by the mountainous tract of Tocuyo and Nirgua from the great\r\nplains of La Portuguesa and Calabozo. It is very extraordinary to see\r\nbarren savannahs loaded with miasmata. No marshy ground is found\r\nthere, but several phenomena indicate a disengagement of hydrogen.* (*\r\nWhat is that luminous phenomenon known under the name of the Lantern\r\n(farol) of Maracaybo, which is perceived every night toward the\r\nseaside as well as in the inland parts, at Merida for example, where\r\nM. Palacios observed it during two years? The distance, greater than\r\n40 leagues, at which the light is observed, has led to the supposition\r\nthat it might be owing to the effects of a thunderstorm, or of\r\nelectrical explosions which might daily take place in a pass in the\r\nmountains. It is asserted that, on approaching the farol, the rolling\r\nof thunder is heard. Others vaguely allege that it is an air-volcano,\r\nand that asphaltic soils, like those of Mena, cause these inflammable\r\nexhalations which are so constant in their appearance. The phenomenon\r\nis observed on a mountainous and uninhabited spot, on the borders of\r\nthe Rio Catatumbo, near the junction with the Rio Sulia. The situation\r\nof the farol is such that, being nearly in the meridian of the opening\r\n(boca) of the lake of Maracaybo, navigators are guided by it as by a\r\nlighthouse.) When travellers, who are not acquainted with natural\r\ninflammable gases, are shown the Cueva del Serrito de Monai, the\r\npeople of the country love to frighten them by setting fire to the\r\ngaseous combination which is constantly accumulated in the upper part\r\nof the cavern. May we attribute the insalubrity of the atmosphere to\r\nthe same causes as those which operate in the plains between Tivoli\r\nand Rome, namely, disengagements of sulphuretted hydrogen?* (* Don\r\nCarlos del Pozo has discovered in this district, at the bottom of the\r\nQuebrada de Moroturo, a stratum of clayey earth, black, strongly\r\nsoiling the fingers, emitting a powerful smell of sulphur, and\r\ninflaming spontaneously when slightly moistened and exposed for a long\r\ntime to the rays of the tropical sun. The detonation of this muddy\r\nsubstance is very violent.) Possibly, also, the mountainous lands,\r\nnear the llanos of Monai, may have a baneful influence on the\r\nsurrounding plains. The south-easterly winds may convey to them the\r\nputrid exhalations that rise from the ravine of Villegas, and from La\r\nSienega de Cabra, between Carora and Carache. I am desirous of\r\ncollecting every circumstance having a relation to the salubrity of\r\nthe air; for, in a matter so obscure, it is only by the comparison of\r\na great number of phenomena, that we can hope to discover the truth.\r\n\r\nThe barren yet feverish savannahs, extending from Barquesimeto to the\r\neastern shore of the lake of Maracaybo, are partly covered with\r\ncactus; but the good silvester-cochineal, known by the vague name of\r\ngrana de Carora, comes from a more temperate region, between Carora\r\nand Truxillo, and particularly from the valley of the Rio Mucuju,* to\r\nthe east of Merida. (* This little river descends from the Paramo de\r\nlos Conejos, and flows into the Rio Albarregas.) The inhabitants\r\naltogether neglect this production, so much sought for in commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.17.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS WHICH SEPARATE THE VALLEYS OF ARAGUA FROM THE LLANOS OF\r\nCARACAS.\r\nVILLA DE CURA.\r\nPARAPARA.\r\nLLANOS OR STEPPES.\r\nCALABOZO.\r\n\r\nThe chain of mountains, bordering the lake of Tacarigua towards the\r\nsouth, forms in some sort the northern shore of the great basin of the\r\nLlanos or savannahs of Caracas. To descend from the valleys of Aragua\r\ninto these savannahs, it is necessary to cross the mountains of Guigue\r\nand of Tucutunemo. From a peopled country embellished by cultivation,\r\nwe plunge into a vast solitude. Accustomed to the aspect of rocks, and\r\nto the shade of valleys, the traveller beholds with astonishment these\r\nsavannahs without trees, these immense plains, which seem to ascend to\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nBefore I trace the scenery of the Llanos, or of the region of\r\npasturage, I will briefly describe the road we took from Nueva\r\nValencia, by Villa de Cura and San Juan, to the little village of\r\nOrtiz, at the entrance of the steppes. We left the valleys of Aragua\r\non the 6th of March before sunrise. We passed over a plain richly\r\ncultivated, keeping along the south-west side of the lake of Valencia,\r\nand crossing the ground left uncovered by the waters of the lake. We\r\nwere never weary of admiring the fertility of the soil, covered with\r\ncalabashes, water-melons, and plantains. The rising of the sun was\r\nannounced by the distant noise of the howling monkeys. Approaching a\r\ngroup of trees, which rise in the midst of the plain, between those\r\nparts which were anciently the islets of Don Pedro and La Negra, we\r\nsaw numerous bands of araguatos moving as in procession and very\r\nslowly, from one tree to another. A male was followed by a great\r\nnumber of females; several of the latter carrying their young on their\r\nshoulders. The howling monkeys, which live in society in different\r\nparts of America, everywhere resemble each other in their manners,\r\nthough the species are not always the same. The uniformity with which\r\nthe araguatos* (* Simia ursina.) perform their movements is extremely\r\nstriking. Whenever the branches of neighbouring trees do not touch\r\neach other, the male who leads the party suspends himself by the\r\ncallous and prehensile part of his tail; and, letting fall the rest of\r\nhis body, swings himself till in one of his oscillations he reaches\r\nthe neighbouring branch. The whole file performs the same movements on\r\nthe same spot. It is almost superfluous to add how dubious is the\r\nassertion of Ulloa, and so many otherwise well-informed travellers,\r\naccording to whom, the marimondos,* (* Simia belzebuth.) the\r\naraguatos, and other monkeys with a prehensile tail, form a sort of\r\nchain, in order to reach the opposite side of a river.* (* Ulloa has\r\nnot hesitated to represent in an engraving this extraordinary feat of\r\nthe monkeys with a prehensile tail.--See Viage a la America\r\nMeridional, Madrid 1748.) We had opportunities, during five years, of\r\nobserving thousands of these animals; and for this very reason we\r\nplace no confidence in statements possibly invented by the Europeans\r\nthemselves, though repeated by the Indians of the Missions, as if they\r\nhad been transmitted to them by their fathers. Man, the most remote\r\nfrom civilization, enjoys the astonishment he excites in recounting\r\nthe marvels of his country. He says he has seen what he imagines may\r\nhave been seen by others. Every savage is a hunter, and the stories of\r\nhunters borrow from the imagination in proportion as the animals, of\r\nwhich they boast the artifices, are endowed with a high degree of\r\nintelligence. Hence arise the fictions of which foxes, monkeys, crows,\r\nand the condor of the Andes, have been the subjects in both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\nThe araguatos are accused of sometimes abandoning their young, that\r\nthey may be lighter for flight when pursued by the Indian hunters. It\r\nis said that mothers have been seen removing their young from their\r\nshoulders, and throwing them down to the foot of the tree. I am\r\ninclined to believe that a movement merely accidental has been\r\nmistaken for one premeditated. The Indians have a dislike and a\r\npredilection for certain races of monkeys; they love the viuditas, the\r\ntitis, and generally all the little sagoins; while the araguatos, on\r\naccount of their mournful aspect, and their uniform howling, are at\r\nonce detested and abused. In reflecting on the causes that may\r\nfacilitate the propagation of sound in the air during the night, I\r\nthought it important to determine with precision the distance at\r\nwhich, especially in damp and stormy weather, the howling of a band of\r\naraguatos is heard. I believe I obtained proof of its being\r\ndistinguished at eight hundred toises distance. The monkeys which are\r\nfurnished with four hands cannot make excursions in the Llanos; and it\r\nis easy, amidst vast plains covered with grass, to recognize a\r\nsolitary group of trees, whence the noise proceeds, and which is\r\ninhabited by howling monkeys. Now, by approaching or withdrawing from\r\nthis group of trees, the maximum of the distance may be measured, at\r\nwhich the howling is heard. These distances appeared to me sometimes\r\none-third greater during the night, especially when the weather was\r\ncloudy, very hot, and humid.\r\n\r\nThe Indians pretend that when the araguatos fill the forests with\r\ntheir howling, there is always one that chaunts as leader of the\r\nchorus. The observation is pretty accurate. During a long interval one\r\nsolitary and strong voice is generally distinguished, till its place\r\nis taken by another voice of a different pitch. We may observe from\r\ntime to time the same instinct of imitation among frogs, and almost\r\nall animals which live together and exert their voices in union. The\r\nMissionaries further assert, that, when a female among the araguatos\r\nis on the point of bringing forth, the choir suspends its howlings\r\ntill the moment of the birth of the young. I could not myself judge of\r\nthe accuracy of this assertion; but I do not believe it to be entirely\r\nunfounded. I have observed that, when an extraordinary incident, the\r\nmoans for instance of a wounded araguato, fixed the attention of the\r\nband, the howlings were for some minutes suspended. Our guides assured\r\nus gravely, that, to cure an asthma, it is sufficient to drink out of\r\nthe bony drum of the hyoidal bone of the araguato. This animal having\r\nso extraordinary a volume of voice, it is supposed that its larynx\r\nmust necessarily impart to the water poured into it the virtue of\r\ncuring affections of the lungs. Such is the science of the vulgar,\r\nwhich sometimes resembles that of the ancients.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night at the village of Guigue, the latitude of which I\r\nfound by observations of Canopus to be 10 degrees 4 minutes 11\r\nseconds. The village, surrounded with the richest cultivation, is only\r\na thousand toises distant from the lake of Tacarigua. We lodged with\r\nan old sergeant, a native of Murcia, a man of a very original\r\ncharacter. To prove to us that he had studied among the Jesuits, he\r\nrecited the history of the creation of the world in Latin. He knew the\r\nnames of Augustus, Tiberius, and Diocletian; and while enjoying the\r\nagreeable coolness of the nights in an enclosure planted with bananas,\r\nhe employed himself in reading all that related to the courts of the\r\nRoman emperors. He inquired of us with earnestness for a remedy for\r\nthe gout, from which he suffered severely. \"I know,\" said he, \"a Zambo\r\nof Valencia, a famous curioso, who could cure me; but the Zambo would\r\nexpect to be treated with attentions which I cannot pay to a man of\r\nhis colour, and I prefer remaining as I am.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving Guigue we began to ascend the chain of mountains, extending\r\non the south of the lake towards Guacimo and La Palma. From the top of\r\na table-land, at three hundred and twenty toises of elevation, we saw\r\nfor the last time the valleys of Aragua. The gneiss appeared\r\nuncovered, presenting the same direction of strata, and the same dip\r\ntowards the north-west. Veins of quartz, that traverse the gneiss, are\r\nauriferous; and hence the neighbouring ravine bears the name of\r\nQuebrada del Oro. We heard with surprise at every step the name of\r\n\"ravine of gold,\" in a country where only one single mine of copper is\r\nwrought. We travelled five leagues to the village of Maria Magdalena,\r\nand two leagues more to the Villa de Cura. It was Sunday, and at the\r\nvillage of Maria Magdalena the inhabitants were assembled before the\r\nchurch. They wanted to force our muleteers to stop and hear mass. We\r\nresolved to remain; but, after a long altercation, the muleteers\r\npursued their way. I may observe, that this is the only dispute in\r\nwhich we became engaged from such a cause. Very erroneous ideas are\r\nformed in Europe of the intolerance, and even of the religious fervour\r\nof the Spanish colonists.\r\n\r\nSan Luis de Cura, or, as it is commonly called, the Villa de Cura,\r\nlies in a very barren valley, running north-west and south-east, and\r\nelevated, according to my barometrical observations, two hundred and\r\nsixty-six toises above the level of the ocean. The country, with the\r\nexception of some fruit-trees, is almost destitute of vegetation. The\r\ndryness of the plateau is the greater, because (and this circumstance\r\nis rather extraordinary in a country of primitive rocks) several\r\nrivers lose themselves in crevices in the ground. The Rio de Las\r\nMinas, north of the Villa de Cura, is lost in a rock, again appears,\r\nand then is ingulphed anew without reaching the lake of Valencia,\r\ntowards which it flows. Cura resembles a village more than a town. We\r\nlodged with a family who had excited the resentment of government\r\nduring the revolution at Caracas in 1797. One of the sons, after\r\nhaving languished in a dungeon, had been sent to the Havannah, to be\r\nimprisoned in a strong fortress. With what joy his mother heard that\r\nafter our return from the Orinoco, we should visit the Havannah! She\r\nentrusted me with five piastres, \"the whole fruit of her savings.\" I\r\nearnestly wished to return them to her; but I feared to wound her\r\ndelicacy, and give pain to a mother, who felt a pleasure in the\r\nprivations she imposed on herself.\r\n\r\nAll the society of the town was assembled in the evening, to admire in\r\na magic lantern views of the great capitals of Europe. We were shown\r\nthe palace of the Tuileries, and the statue of the Elector at Berlin.\r\n\r\nAn apothecary who had been ruined by an unhappy propensity for working\r\nmines, accompanied us in our excursion to the Serro de Chacao, very\r\nrich in auriferous pyrites. We continued to descend the southern\r\ndeclivity of the Cordillera of the coast, in which the plains of\r\nAragua form a longitudinal valley. We passed a part of the night of\r\nthe 11th of March at the village of San Juan, remarkable for its\r\nthermal waters, and the singular form of two neighbouring mountains,\r\ncalled the Morros of San Juan. They form slender peaks, which rise\r\nfrom a wall of rocks with a very extensive base. The wall is\r\nperpendicular, and resembles the Devil's Wall, which surrounds a part\r\nof the group of mountains in the Hartz.* (* Die Teufels Mauer near\r\nWernigerode in Germany.) These peaks, when seen from afar in the\r\nLlanos, strike the imagination of the inhabitants of the plain, who\r\nare not accustomed to the least unequal ground, and the height of the\r\npeaks is singularly exaggerated by them. They were described to us as\r\nbeing in the middle of the steppes (which they in reality bound on the\r\nnorth) far beyond a range of hills called La Galera. Judging from\r\nangles taken at the distance of two miles, these hills are scarcely\r\nmore than a hundred and fifty-six toises higher than the village of\r\nSan Juan, and three hundred and fifty toises above the level of the\r\nLlanos. The thermal waters glide out at the foot of these hills, which\r\nare formed of transition-limestone. The waters are impregnated with\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, like those of Mariara, and form a little pool\r\nor lagoon, in which the thermometer rose only to 31.3 degrees. I\r\nfound, on the night of the 9th of March, by very satisfactory\r\nobservations of the stars, the latitude of Villa de Cura to be 10\r\ndegrees 2 minutes 47 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Villa de Cura is celebrated in the country for the miracles of an\r\nimage of the Virgin, known by the name of Nuestra Senora de los\r\nValencianos. This image was found in a ravine by an Indian, about the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century, when it became the object of a\r\ncontest between the towns of Cura and San Sebastian de los Reyes. The\r\nvicars of the latter town asserting that the Virgin had made her first\r\nappearance on the territory of their parish, the Bishop of Caracas, in\r\norder to put an end to the scandal of this long dispute, caused the\r\nimage to be placed in the archives of his bishopric, and kept it\r\nthirty years under seal. It was not restored to the inhabitants of\r\nCura till 1802.\r\n\r\nAfter having bathed in the cool and limpid water of the little river\r\nof San Juan, the bottom of which is of basaltic grunstein, we\r\ncontinued our journey at two in the morning, by Ortiz and Parapara, to\r\nthe Mesa de Paja. The road to the Llanos being at that time infested\r\nwith robbers, several travellers joined us so as to form a sort of\r\ncaravan. We proceeded down hill during six or seven hours; and we\r\nskirted the Cerro de Flores, near which the road turns off, leading to\r\nthe great village of San Jose de Tisnao. We passed the farms of Luque\r\nand Juncalito, to enter the valleys which, on account of the bad road,\r\nand the blue colour of the slates, bear the names of Malpaso and\r\nPiedras Azules.\r\n\r\nThis ground is the ancient shore of the great basin of the steppes,\r\nand it furnishes an interesting subject of research to the geologist.\r\nWe there find trap-formations, probably more recent than the veins of\r\ndiabasis near the town of Caracas, which seem to belong to the rocks\r\nof igneous formation. They are not long and narrow streams as in\r\nAuvergne, but large sheets, streams that appear like real strata. The\r\nlithoid masses here cover, if we may use the expression, the shore of\r\nthe ancient interior sea; everything subject to destruction, such as\r\nthe liquid dejections, and the scoriae filled with bubbles, has been\r\ncarried away. These phenomena are particularly worthy of attention on\r\naccount of the close affinities observed between the phonolites and\r\nthe amygdaloids, which, containing pyroxenes and\r\nhornblende-grunsteins, form strata in a transition-slate. The better\r\nto convey an idea of the whole situation and superposition of these\r\nrocks, we will name the formations as they occur in a profile drawn\r\nfrom north to south.\r\n\r\nWe find at first, in the Sierra de Mariara, which belongs to the\r\nnorthern branch of the Cordillera of the coast, a coarse-grained\r\ngranite; then, in the valleys of Aragua, on the borders of the lake,\r\nand in the islands, it contains, as in the southern branch of the\r\nchain of the coast, gneiss and mica-slate. These last-named rocks are\r\nauriferous in the Quebrada del Oro, near Guigue; and between Villa de\r\nCura and the Morros de San Juan, in the mountain of Chacao. The gold\r\nis contained in pyrites, which are found sometimes disseminated almost\r\nimperceptibly in the whole mass of the gneiss,* and sometimes united\r\nin small veins of quartz. (* The four metals, which are found\r\ndisseminated in the granite rocks, as if they were of contemporaneous\r\nformation, are gold, tin, titanium, and cobalt.) Most of the torrents\r\nthat traverse the mountains bear along with them grains of gold. The\r\npoor inhabitants of Villa de Cura and San Juan have sometimes gained\r\nthirty piastres a-day by washing the sand; but most commonly, in spite\r\nof their industry, they do not in a week find particles of gold of the\r\nvalue of two piastres. Here, however, as in every place where native\r\ngold and auriferous pyrites are disseminated in the rock, or by the\r\ndestruction of the rocks, are deposited in alluvial lands, the people\r\nconceive the most exaggerated ideas of the metallic riches of the\r\nsoil. But the success of the workings, which depends less on the\r\nabundance of the ore in a vast space of land than on its accumulation\r\nin one point, has not justified these favourable prepossessions. The\r\nmountain of Chacao, bordered by the ravine of Tucutunemo, rises seven\r\nhundred feet above the village of San Juan. It is formed of gneiss,\r\nwhich, especially in the superior strata, passes into mica-slate. We\r\nsaw the remains of an ancient mine, known by the name of Real de Santa\r\nBarbara. The works were directed to a stratum of cellular quartz,*\r\nfull of polyhedric cavities, mixed with iron-ore, containing\r\nauriferous pyrites and small grains of gold, sometimes, it is said,\r\nvisible to the naked eye. (* This stratum of quartz, and the gneiss in\r\nwhich it is contained, lie hor 8 of the Freyberg compass, and dip 70\r\ndegrees to the south-west. At a hundred toises distance from the\r\nauriferous quartz, the gneiss resumes its ordinary situation, hor 3 to\r\n4, with 60 degrees dip to the north-west. A few strata of gneiss\r\nabound in silvery mica, and contain, instead of garnets, an immense\r\nquantity of small octohedrons of pyrites. This silvery gneiss\r\nresembles that of the famous mine of Himmelsfurst, in Saxony.) It\r\nappears that the gneiss of the Cerro de Chacao also furnishes another\r\nmetallic deposit, a mixture of copper and silver-ores. This deposit\r\nhas been the object of works attempted with great ignorance by some\r\nMexican miners under the superintendance of M. Avalo. The gallery*\r\ndirected to the north-east, is only twenty-five toises long. (* La\r\nCueva de los Mexicanos.) We there found some fine specimens of blue\r\ncarbonated copper mingled with sulphate of barytes and quartz; but we\r\ncould not ourselves judge whether the ore contained any argentiferous\r\nfahlerz, and whether it occurred in a stratum, or, as the apothecary\r\nwho was our guide asserted, in real veins. This much is certain, that\r\nthe attempt at working the mine cost more than twelve thousand\r\npiastres in two years. It would no doubt have been more prudent to\r\nhave resumed the works on the auriferous stratum of the Real de Santa\r\nBarbara.\r\n\r\nThe zone of gneiss just mentioned is, in the coast-chain from the sea\r\nto the Villa de Cura, ten leagues broad. In this great extent of land,\r\ngneiss and mica-slate are found exclusively, and they constitute one\r\nformation.* (* This formation, which we shall call gneiss-mica-slate,\r\nis peculiar to the chain of the coast of Caracas. Five formations must\r\nbe distinguished, as MM. von Buch and Raumer have so ably demonstrated\r\nin their excellent papers on Landeck and the Riesengebirge, namely,\r\ngranite, granite-gneiss, gneiss, gneiss-mica-slate, and mica-slate.\r\nGeologists whose researches have been confined to a small tract of\r\nland, having confounded these formations which nature has separated in\r\nseveral countries in the most distinct manner, have admitted that the\r\ngneiss and mica-slate alternate everywhere in superimposed beds, or\r\nfurnish insensible transitions from one rock to the other. These\r\ntransitions and alternating superpositions take place no doubt in\r\nformations of granite-gneiss and gneiss-mica-slate; but because these\r\nphenomena are observed in one region, it does not follow that in other\r\nregions we may not find very distinct circumscribed formations of\r\ngranite, gneiss, and mica-slate. The same considerations may be\r\napplied to the formations of serpentine, which are sometimes isolated,\r\nand sometimes belong to the eurite, mica-slate, and grunstein.) Beyond\r\nthe town of Villa de Cura and the Cerro de Chacao the aspect of the\r\ncountry presents greater geognostic variety. There are still eight\r\nleagues of declivity from the table-land of Cura to the entry of the\r\nLlanos; and on the southern slope of the mountains of the coast, four\r\ndifferent formations of rock cover the gneiss. We shall first give the\r\ndescription of the different strata, without grouping them\r\nsystematically.\r\n\r\nOn the south of the Cerro de Chacao, between the ravine of Tucutunemo\r\nand Piedras Negras, the gneiss is concealed beneath a formation of\r\nserpentine, of which the composition varies in the different\r\nsuperimposed strata. Sometimes it is very pure, very homogeneous, of a\r\ndusky olive-green, and of a conchoidal fracture: sometimes it is\r\nveined, mixed with bluish steatite, of an unequal fracture, and\r\ncontaining spangles of mica. In both these states I could not discover\r\nin it either garnets, hornblende, or diallage. Advancing farther to\r\nthe south (and we always passed over this ground in that direction)\r\nthe green of the serpentine grows deeper, and feldspar and hornblende\r\nare recognised in it: it is difficult to determine whether it passes\r\ninto diabasis or alternates with it. There is, however, no doubt of\r\nits containing veins of copper-ore.* (* One of these veins, on which\r\ntwo shafts have been sunk, was directed hor. 2.1, and dipped 80\r\ndegrees east. The strata of the serpentine, where it is stratified\r\nwith some regularity, run hor. 8, and dip almost perpendicularly. I\r\nfound malachite disseminated in this serpentine, where it passes into\r\ngrunstein.) At the foot of this mountain two fine springs gush out\r\nfrom the serpentine. Near the village of San Juan, the granular\r\ndiabasis appears alone uncovered, and takes a greenish black hue. The\r\nfeldspar intimately mixed with the mass, may be separated into\r\ndistinct crystals. The mica is very rare, and there is no quartz. The\r\nmass assumes at the surface a yellowish crust like dolerite and\r\nbasalt.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this tract of trap-formation, the Morros of San Juan\r\nrise like two castles in ruins. They appear linked to the mornes of\r\nSt. Sebastian, and to La Galera which bounds the Llanos like a rocky\r\nwall. The Morros of San Juan are formed of limestone of a crystalline\r\ntexture; sometimes very compact, sometimes spongy, of a greenish-grey,\r\nshining, composed of small grains, and mixed with scattered spangles\r\nof mica. This limestone yields a strong effervescence with acids. I\r\ncould not find in it any vestige of organized bodies. It contains in\r\nsubordinate strata, masses of hardened clay of a blackish blue, and\r\ncarburetted. These masses are fissile, very heavy, and loaded with\r\niron; their streak is whitish, and they produce no effervescence with\r\nacids. They assume at their surface, by their decomposition in the\r\nair, a yellow colour. We seem to recognize in these argillaceous\r\nstrata a tendency either to the transition-slates, or to the\r\nkieselschiefer (schistose jasper), which everywhere characterise the\r\nblack transition-limestones. When in fragments, they might be taken at\r\nfirst sight for basalt or hornblende.* (* I had an opportunity of\r\nexamining again, with the greatest care, the rocks of San Juan, of\r\nChacao, of Parapara, and of Calabozo, during my stay at Mexico, where,\r\nconjointly with M. del Rio, one of the most distinguished pupils of\r\nthe school of Freyberg, I formed a geognostical collection for the\r\nColegio de Mineria of New Spain.) Another white limestone, compact,\r\nand containing some fragments of shells, backs the Morros de San Juan.\r\nI could not see the line of junction of these two limestones, or that\r\nof the calcareous formation and the diabasis.\r\n\r\nThe transverse valley which descends from Piedras Negras and the\r\nvillage of San Juan, towards Parapara and the Llanos, is filled with\r\ntrap-rocks, displaying close affinity with the formation of green\r\nslates, which they cover. Sometimes we seem to see serpentine,\r\nsometimes grunstein, and sometimes dolerite and basalt. The\r\narrangement of these problematical masses is not less extraordinary.\r\nBetween San Juan, Malpaso, and Piedras Azules, they form strata\r\nparallel to each other; and dipping regularly northward at an angle of\r\n40 or 50 degrees, they cover even the green slates in concordant\r\nstratification. Lower down, towards Parapara and Ortiz, where the\r\namygdaloids and phonolites are connected with the grunstein,\r\neverything assumes a basaltic aspect. Balls of grunstein heaped one\r\nupon another, form those rounded cones, which are found so frequently\r\nin the Mittelgebirge in Bohemia, near Bilin, the country of\r\nphonolites. The following is the result of my partial observations.\r\n\r\nThe grunstein, which at first alternated with strata of serpentine, or\r\nwas connected with that rock by insensible transitions, is seen alone,\r\nsometimes in strata considerably inclined, and sometimes in balls with\r\nconcentric strata, imbedded in strata of the same substance. It lies,\r\nnear Malpaso, on green slates, steatitic, mingled with hornblende,\r\ndestitute of mica and grains of quartz, dipping, like the grunsteins,\r\n45 degrees toward the north, and directed, like them, 75 degrees\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\nA great sterility prevails where these green slates predominate, no\r\ndoubt on account of the magnesia they contain, which (as is proved by\r\nthe magnesian-limestone of England*) is very hurtful to vegetation. (*\r\nMagnesian limestone is of a straw-yellow colour, and contains\r\nmadrepores: it lies beneath red marl, or muriatiferous red sandstone.)\r\nThe dip of the green slates continues the same; but by degrees the\r\ndirection of their strata becomes parallel to the general direction of\r\nthe primitive rocks of the chain of the coast. At Piedras Azules these\r\nslates, mingled with hornblende, cover in concordant stratification a\r\nblackish-blue slate, very fissile, and traversed by small veins of\r\nquartz. The green slates include some strata of grunstein, and even\r\ncontain balls of that substance. I nowhere saw the green slates\r\nalternate with the black slates of the ravine of Piedras Azules: at\r\nthe line of junction these two slates appear rather to pass one into\r\nthe other, the green slates becoming of a pearl-grey in proportion as\r\nthey lose their hornblende.\r\n\r\nFarther south, towards Parapara and Ortiz, the slates disappear. They\r\nare concealed under a trap-formation more varied in its aspect. The\r\nsoil becomes more fertile; the rocky masses alternate with strata of\r\nclay, which appear to be produced by the decomposition of the\r\ngrunsteins, the amygdaloids, and the phonolites.\r\n\r\nThe grunstein, which farther north was less granulous, and passed into\r\nserpentine, here assumes a very different character. It contains balls\r\nof mandelstein, or amygdaloid, eight or ten inches in diameter. These\r\nballs, sometimes a little flattened, are divided into concentric\r\nlayers: this is the effect of decomposition. Their nucleus is almost\r\nas hard as basalt, and they are intermingled with little cavities,\r\nowing to bubbles of gas, filled with green earth, and crystals of\r\npyroxene and mesotype. Their basis is greyish blue, rather soft, and\r\nshowing small white spots which, by the regular form they present, I\r\nshould conceive to be decomposed feldspar. M. von Buch examined with a\r\npowerful lens the species we brought. He discovered that each crystal\r\nof pyroxene, enveloped in the earthy mass, is separated from it by\r\nfissures parallel to the sides of the crystal. These fissures seem to\r\nbe the effect of a contraction which the mass or basis of the\r\nmandelstein has undergone. I sometimes saw these balls of mandelstein\r\narranged in strata, and separated from each other by beds of grunstein\r\nof ten or fourteen inches thick; sometimes (and this situation is most\r\ncommon) the balls of mandelstein, two or three feet in diameter, are\r\nfound in heaps, and form little mounts with rounded summits, like\r\nspheroidal basalt. The clay which separates these amygdaloid\r\nconcretions arises from the decomposition of their crust. They acquire\r\nby the contact of the air a very thin coating of yellow ochre.\r\n\r\nSouth-west of the village of Parapara rises the little Cerro de\r\nFlores, which is discerned from afar in the steppes. Almost at its\r\nfoot, and in the midst of the mandelstein tract we have just been\r\ndescribing, a porphyritic phonolite, a mass of compact feldspar of a\r\ngreenish grey, or mountain-green, containing long crystals of vitreous\r\nfeldspar, appears exposed. It is the real porphyrschiefer of Werner;\r\nand it would be difficult to distinguish, in a collection of stones,\r\nthe phonolite of Parapara from that of Bilin, in Bohemia. It does not,\r\nhowever, here form rocks in grotesque shapes, but little hills covered\r\nwith tabular blocks, large plates extremely sonorous, translucid on\r\nthe edges, and wounding the hands when broken.\r\n\r\nSuch are the successions of rocks, which I described on the spot as I\r\nprogressively found them, from the lake of Tacarigua to the entrance\r\nof the steppes. Few places in Europe display a geological arrangement\r\nso well worthy of being studied. We saw there in succession six\r\nformations: namely, mica-slate-gneiss, green transition-slate, black\r\ntransition-limestone, serpentine and grunstein, amygdaloid (with\r\npyroxene), and phonolite.\r\n\r\nI must observe, in the first place, that the substance just described\r\nunder the name of grunstein, in every respect resembles that which\r\nforms layers in the mica-slate of Cabo Blanco, and veins near Caracas.\r\nIt differs only by containing neither quartz, garnets, nor pyrites.\r\nThe close relations we observed near the Cerro de Chacao, between the\r\ngrunstein and the serpentine, cannot surprise these geologists who\r\nhave studied the mountains of Franconia and Silesia. Near Zobtenberg*\r\n(* Between Tampadel and Silsterwiz.) a serpentine rock alternates also\r\nwith gabbro. In the district of Glatz the fissures of the gabbro are\r\nfilled with a steatite of a greenish white colour, and the rock which\r\nwas long thought to belong to the grunsteins* is a close mixture of\r\nfeldspar and diallage. (* In the mountains of Bareuth, in Franconia,\r\nso abundant in grunstein and serpentine, these formations are not\r\nconnected together. The serpentine there belongs rather to the\r\nschistose hornblende (hornblendschiefer), as in the island of Cuba.\r\nNear Guanaxuato, in Mexico, I saw it alternating with syenite. These\r\nphenomena of serpentine rocks forming layers in eurite (weisstein), in\r\nschistose hornblende, in gabbro, and in syenite, are so much the more\r\nremarkable, as the great mass of garnetiferous serpentines, which are\r\nfound in the mountains of gneiss and mica-slate, form little distinct\r\nmounts, masses not covered by other formations. It is not the same in\r\nthe mixtures of serpentine and granulated limestone.)\r\n\r\nThe grunsteins of Tucutunemo, which we consider as constituting the\r\nsame formation as the serpentine rock, contain veins of malachite and\r\ncopper-pyrites. These same metalliferous combinations are found also\r\nin Franconia, in the grunsteins of the mountains of Steben and\r\nLichtenberg. With respect to the green slates of Malpaso, which have\r\nall the characters of transition-slates, they are identical with those\r\nwhich M. von Buch has so well described, near Schonau, in Silesia.\r\nThey contain beds of grunstein, like the slates of the mountains of\r\nSteben just mentioned.* (* On advancing into the adit for draining the\r\nFriedrich-Wilhelmstollen mine, which I caused to be begun in 1794,\r\nnear Steben, and which is yet only 340 toises long, there have\r\nsuccessively been found, in the transition-slate subordinate strata of\r\npure and porphyritic grunstein, strata, of Lydian stone and ampelite\r\n(alaunschiefer), and strata of fine-grained grunstein. All these\r\nstrata characterise the transition-slates.) The black limestone of the\r\nMorros de San Juan is also a transition-limestone. It forms perhaps a\r\nsubordinate stratum in the slates of Malpaso. This situation would be\r\nanalogous to what is observed in several parts of Switzerland.* (* For\r\nInstance, at the Glyshorn, at the Col de Balme, etc.) The slaty zone,\r\nthe centre of which is the ravine of Piedras Azules, appears divided\r\ninto two formations. On some points we think we observe one passing\r\ninto the other.\r\n\r\nThe grunsteins, which begin again to the south of these slates, appear\r\nto me to differ little from those found north of the ravine of Piedras\r\nAzules. I did not see there any pyroxene; but on the very spot I\r\nrecognized a number of crystals in the amygdaloid, which appears so\r\nstrongly linked to the grunstein that they alternate several times.\r\n\r\nThe geologist may consider his task as fulfilled when he has traced\r\nwith accuracy the positions of the diverse strata; and has pointed out\r\nthe analogies traceable between these positions and what has been\r\nobserved in other countries. But how can he avoid being tempted to go\r\nback to the origin of so many different substances, and to inquire how\r\nfar the dominion of fire has extended in the mountains that bound the\r\ngreat basin of the steppes? In researches on the position of rocks we\r\nhave generally to complain of not sufficiently perceiving the\r\nconnection between the masses, which we believe to be superimposed on\r\none another. Here the difficulty seems to arise from the too intimate\r\nand too numerous relations observed in rocks that are thought not to\r\nbelong to the same family.\r\n\r\nThe phonolite (or leucostine compacte of Cordier) is pretty generally\r\nregarded by all who have at once examined burning and extinguished\r\nvolcanoes, as a flow of lithoid lava. I found no real basalt or\r\ndolerite; but the presence of pyroxene in the amygdaloid of Parapara\r\nleaves little doubt of the igneous origin of those spheroidal masses,\r\nfissured, and full of cavities. Balls of this amygdaloid are enclosed\r\nin the grunstein; and this grunstein alternates on one side with a\r\ngreen slate, on the other with the serpentine of Tucutunemo. Here,\r\nthen, is a connexion sufficiently close established between the\r\nphonolites and the green slates, between the pyroxenic amygdaloids and\r\nthe serpentines containing copper-ores, between volcanic substances\r\nand others that are included under the vague name of transition-traps.\r\nAll these masses are destitute of quartz like the real\r\ntrap-porphyries, or volcanic trachytes. This phenomenon is the more\r\nremarkable, as the grunsteins which are called primitive almost always\r\ncontain quartz in Europe. The most general dip of the slates of\r\nPiedras Azules, of the grunsteins of Parapara, and of the pyroxenic\r\namygdaloids embedded in strata of grunstein, does not follow the slope\r\nof the ground from north to south, but is pretty regular towards the\r\nnorth. The strata incline towards the chain of the coast, as\r\nsubstances which had not been in fusion might be supposed to do. Can\r\nwe admit that so many alternating rocks, imbedded one in the other,\r\nhave a common origin? The nature of the phonolites, which are lithoid\r\nlavas with a feldspar basis, and the nature of the green slates\r\nintermixed with hornblende, oppose this opinion. In this state of\r\nthings we may choose between two solutions of the problem in question.\r\nIn one of these solutions the phonolite of the Cerro de Flores is to\r\nbe regarded as the sole volcanic production of the tract; and we are\r\nforced to unite the pyroxenic amygdaloids with the rest of the\r\ngrunsteins, in one single formation, that which is so common in the\r\ntransition-mountains of Europe, considered hitherto as not volcanic.\r\nIn the other solution of the problem, the masses of phonolite,\r\namygdaloid, and grunstein, which are found in the south of the ravine\r\nof Piedras Azules, are separated from the grunsteins and serpentine\r\nrocks that cover the declivity of the mountains north of the ravine.\r\nIn the present state of knowledge I find difficulties almost equally\r\ngreat in adopting either of these suppositions; but I have no doubt\r\nthat, when the real grunsteins (not the hornblende-grunsteins)\r\ncontained in the gneiss and mica-slates, shall have been more\r\nattentively examined in other places; when the basalts (with pyroxene)\r\nforming strata in primitive rocks* (* For instance, at Krobsdorf, in\r\nSilesia, a stratum of basalt has been recognized in the mica-slate by\r\ntwo celebrated geologists, MM. von Buch and Raumer. (Vom Granite des\r\nRiesengebirges, 1813.) and the diabases and amygdaloids in the\r\ntransition mountains, shall have been carefully studied; when the\r\ntexture of the masses shall have been subjected to a kind of\r\nmechanical analysis, and the hornblendes better distinguished from the\r\npyroxenes,* (* The grunsteins or diabases of the Fichtelgebirge, in\r\nFranconia, which belong to the transition-slate, sometimes contain\r\npyroxenes.) and the grunsteins from the dolerites; a great number of\r\nphenomena which now appear isolated and obscure, will be ranged under\r\ngeneral laws. The phonolite and other rocks of igneous origin at\r\nParapara are so much the more interesting, as they indicate ancient\r\neruptions in a granite zone; as they belong to the shore of the basin\r\nof the steppes, as the basalts of Harutsh belong to the shore of the\r\ndesert of Sahara; and lastly, as they are the only rocks of the kind\r\nwe observed in the mountains of the Capitania-General of Caracas,\r\nwhich are also destitute of trachytes or trap-porphyry, basalts, and\r\nvolcanic productions.* (* From the Rio Negro to the coasts of Cumana\r\nand Caracas, to the east of the mountains of Merida, which we did not\r\nvisit.)\r\n\r\nThe southern declivity of the western chain is tolerably steep; the\r\nsteppes, according to my barometrical measurements, being a thousand\r\nfeet lower than the bottom of the basin of Aragua. From the extensive\r\ntable-land of the Villa de Cura we descended towards the banks of the\r\nRio Tucutunemo, which has hollowed for itself, in a serpentine rock, a\r\nlongitudinal valley running from east to west, at nearly the same\r\nlevel as La Victoria. A transverse valley, lying generally north and\r\nsouth, led us into the Llanos, by the villages of Parapara and Ortiz.\r\nIt grows very narrow in several parts. Basins, the bottoms of which\r\nare perfectly horizontal, communicate together by narrow passes with\r\nsteep declivities. They were, no doubt, formerly small lakes, which,\r\nowing to the accumulation of the waters, or some more violent\r\ncatastrophe, have broken down the dykes by which they were separated.\r\nThis phenomenon is found in both continents, wherever we examine the\r\nlongitudinal valleys forming the passages of the Andes, the Alps,* (*\r\nFor example, the road from the valley of Ursern to the Hospice of St.\r\nGothard, and thence to Airolo.) or the Pyrenees. It is probable, that\r\nthe irruption of the waters towards the Llanos have given, by\r\nextraordinary rents, the form of ruins to the Morros of San Juan and\r\nof San Sebastian. The volcanic tract of Parapara and Ortis is now only\r\n30 or 40 toises above the Llanos. The eruptions consequently took\r\nplace at the lowest point of the granitic chain.\r\n\r\nIn the Mesa de Paja, in the ninth degree of latitude, we entered the\r\nbasin of the Llanos. The sun was almost at its zenith; the earth,\r\nwherever it appeared sterile and destitute of vegetation, was at the\r\ntemperature of 48 or 50 degrees.* (* A thermometer, placed in the\r\nsand, rose to 38.4 and 40 degrees Reaumur.) Not a breath of air was\r\nfelt at the height at which we were on our mules; yet, in the midst of\r\nthis apparent calm, whirls of dust incessantly arose, driven on by\r\nthose small currents of air which glide only over the surface of the\r\nground, and are occasioned by the difference of temperature between\r\nthe naked sand and the spots covered with grass. These sand-winds\r\naugment the suffocating heat of the air. Every grain of quartz, hotter\r\nthan the surrounding air, radiates heat in every direction; and it is\r\ndifficult to observe the temperature of the atmosphere, owing to these\r\nparticles of sand striking against the bulb of the thermometer. All\r\naround us the plains seemed to ascend to the sky, and the vast and\r\nprofound solitude appeared like an ocean covered with sea-weed.\r\nAccording to the unequal mass of vapours diffused through the\r\natmosphere, and the variable decrement in the temperature of the\r\ndifferent strata of air, the horizon in some parts was clear and\r\ndistinct; in other parts it appeared undulating, sinuous, and as if\r\nstriped. The earth there was confounded with the sky. Through the dry\r\nmist and strata of vapour the trunks of palm-trees were seen from\r\nafar, stripped of their foliage and their verdant summits, and looking\r\nlike the masts of a ship descried upon the horizon.\r\n\r\nThere is something awful, as well as sad and gloomy, in the uniform\r\naspect of these steppes. Everything seems motionless; scarcely does a\r\nsmall cloud, passing across the zenith, and denoting the approach of\r\nthe rainy season, cast its shadow on the earth. I know not whether the\r\nfirst aspect of the Llanos excite less astonishment than that of the\r\nchain of the Andes. Mountainous countries, whatever may be the\r\nabsolute elevation of the highest summits, have an analogous\r\nphysiognomy; but we accustom ourselves with difficulty to the view of\r\nthe Llanos of Venezuela and Casanare, to that of the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres and of Chaco, which recal to mind incessantly, and during\r\njourneys of twenty or thirty days, the smooth surface of the ocean. I\r\nhad seen the plains or llanos of La Mancha in Spain, and the heaths\r\n(ericeta) that extend from the extremity of Jutland, through Luneburg\r\nand Westphalia, to Belgium. These last are really steppes, and, during\r\nseveral ages, only small portions of them have yielded to cultivation;\r\nbut the plains of the west and north of Europe present only a feeble\r\nimage of the immense llanos of South America. It is in the south-east\r\nof our continent, in Hungary, between the Danube and the Theiss; in\r\nRussia, between the Borysthenes, the Don, and the Volga, that we find\r\nthose vast pastures, which seem to have been levelled by a long abode\r\nof the waters, and which meet the horizon on every side. The plains of\r\nHungary, where I traversed them on the frontiers of Germany, between\r\nPresburg and Oedenburg, strike the imagination of the traveller by the\r\nconstant mirage; but their greatest extent is more to the east,\r\nbetween Czegled, Debreczin, and Tittel. There they present the\r\nappearance of a vast ocean of verdure, having only two outlets, one\r\nnear Gran and Waitzen, the other between Belgrade and Widdin.\r\n\r\nThe different quarters of the world have been supposed to be\r\ncharacterized by the remark, that Europe has its heaths, Asia its\r\nsteppes, Africa its deserts, and America its savannahs; but by this\r\ndistinction, contrasts are established that are not founded either on\r\nthe nature of things, or the genius of languages. The existence of a\r\nheath always supposes an association of plants of the family of\r\nericae; the steppes of Asia are not everywhere covered with saline\r\nplants; the savannahs of Venezuela furnish not only the gramina, but\r\nwith them small herbaceous mimosas, legumina, and other dicotyledonous\r\nplants. The plains of Songaria, those which extend between the Don and\r\nthe Volga, and the puszta of Hungary, are real savannahs, pasturages\r\nabounding in grasses;* (* These vast steppes of Hungary are elevated\r\nonly thirty or forty toises above the level of the sea, which is more\r\nthan eighty leagues distant from them. See Wahlenberg's Flora\r\nCarpathianica. Baron Podmanitzky, an Hungarian nobleman, highly\r\ndistinguished for his knowledge of the physical sciences, caused the\r\nlevel of these plains to be taken, to facilitate the formation of a\r\ncanal then projected between the Danube and the Theiss. He found the\r\nline of division, or the convexity of the ground, which slopes on each\r\nside towards the beds of the two rivers, to be only thirteen toises\r\nabove the height of the Danube. The widely extended pastures, which\r\nreach in every direction to the horizon, are called in the country,\r\nPuszta, and, over a distance of many leagues, are without any human\r\nhabitation. Plains of this kind, intermingled with marshes and sandy\r\ntracts, are found on the western side of the Theiss, between Czegled,\r\nCsaba, Komloss, and Szarwass; and on the eastern side, between\r\nDebreczin, Karczag, and Szoboszlo. The area of these plains of the\r\ninterior basin of Hungary has been estimated, by a pretty accurate\r\ncalculation, to be between two thousand five hundred and three\r\nthousand square leagues (twenty to a degree). Between Czegled,\r\nSzolnok, and Ketskemet, the plain resembles a sea of sand.) while the\r\nsavannahs to the east and west of the Rocky Mountains and of New\r\nMexico produce chenopodiums containing carbonate and muriate of soda.\r\nAsia has real deserts destitute of vegetation, in Arabia, in Gobi, and\r\nin Persia. Since we have become better acquainted with the deserts in\r\nthe interior of Africa, so long and so vaguely confounded together\r\nunder the name of desert of Sahara (Zahra); it has been observed, that\r\nin this continent, towards the east, savannahs and pastures are found,\r\nas in Arabia, situated in the midst of naked and barren tracts. It is\r\nthese deserts, covered with gravel and destitute of plants, which are\r\nalmost entirely wanting in the New World. I saw them only in that part\r\nof Peru, between Amotape and Coquimbo, on the shores of the Pacific.\r\nThese are called by the Spaniards, not llanos, but the desiertos of\r\nSechura and Atacamez. This solitary tract is not broad, but it is four\r\nhundred and forty leagues long. The rock pierces everywhere through\r\nthe quicksands. No drop of rain ever falls on it; and, like the desert\r\nof Sahara, north of Timbuctoo, the Peruvian desert affords, near\r\nHuaura, a rich mine of native salt. Everywhere else, in the New World,\r\nthere are plains desert because not inhabited, but no real deserts.*\r\n(* We are almost tempted, however, to give the name of desert to that\r\nvast and sandy table-land of Brazil, the Campos dos Parecis, which\r\ngives birth to the rivers Tapajos, Paraguay, and Madeira, and which\r\nreaches the summit of the highest mountains. Almost destitute of\r\nvegetation, it reminds us of Gobi, in Mongolia.)\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena are repeated in the most distant regions; and,\r\ninstead of designating those vast treeless plains in accordance with\r\nthe nature of the plants they produce, it seems natural to class them\r\ninto deserts, steppes, or savannahs; into bare lands without any\r\nappearance of vegetation, and lands covered with gramina or small\r\nplants of the dicotyledonous tribe. The savannahs of America,\r\nespecially those of the temperate zone, have in many works been\r\ndesignated by the French term prairies; but this appears to me little\r\napplicable to pastures which are often very dry, though covered with\r\ngrass of four or five feet in height. The Llanos and the Pampas of\r\nSouth America are really steppes. They are covered with beautiful\r\nverdure in the rainy season, but in the time of great drought they\r\nassume the aspect of a desert. The grass is then reduced to powder;\r\nthe earth cracks; the alligators and the great serpents remain buried\r\nin the dried mud, till awakened from their long lethargy by the first\r\nshowers of spring. These phenomena are observed on barren tracts of\r\nfifty or sixty leagues in length, wherever the savannahs are not\r\ntraversed by rivers; for on the borders of rivulets, and around little\r\npools of stagnant water, the traveller finds at certain distances,\r\neven during the period of the great droughts, thickets of mauritia, a\r\npalm, the leaves of which spread out like a fan, and preserve a\r\nbrilliant verdure.\r\n\r\nThe steppes of Asia are all beyond the tropics, and form very elevated\r\ntable-lands. America also has savannahs of considerable extent on the\r\nbacks of the mountains of Mexico, Peru, and Quito; but its most\r\nextensive steppes, the Llanos of Cumana, Caracas, and Meta, are little\r\nraised above the level of the ocean, and all belong to the equinoctial\r\nzone. These circumstances give them a peculiar character. They have\r\nnot, like the steppes of southern Asia, and the deserts of Persia,\r\nthose lakes without issue, those small systems of rivers which lose\r\nthemselves either in the sands, or by subterranean filtrations. The\r\nLlanos of America incline to the east and south; and their running\r\nwaters are branches of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe course of these rivers once led me to believe, that the plains\r\nformed table-lands, raised at least from one hundred to one hundred\r\nand fifty toises above the level of the ocean. I supposed that the\r\ndeserts of interior Africa were also at a considerable height; and\r\nthat they rose one above another as in tiers, from the coast to the\r\ninterior of the continent. No barometer has yet been carried into the\r\nSahara. With respect to the Llanos of America, I found by barometric\r\nheights observed at Calabozo, at the Villa del Pao, and at the mouth\r\nof the Meta, that their height is only forty or fifty toises above the\r\nlevel of the sea. The fall of the rivers is extremely gentle, often\r\nnearly imperceptible; and therefore the least wind, or the swelling of\r\nthe Orinoco, causes a reflux in those rivers that flow into it. The\r\nIndians believe themselves to be descending during a whole day, when\r\nnavigating from the mouths of these rivers to their sources. The\r\ndescending waters are separated from those that flow back by a great\r\nbody of stagnant water, in which, the equilibrium being disturbed,\r\nwhirlpools are formed very dangerous for boats.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the savannahs or steppes of South America\r\nis the absolute want of hills and inequalities--the perfect level of\r\nevery part of the soil. Accordingly the Spanish conquerors, who first\r\npenetrated from Coro to the banks of the Apure, did not call them\r\ndeserts or savannahs, or meadows, but plains (llanos). Often within a\r\ndistance of thirty square leagues there is not an eminence of a foot\r\nhigh. This resemblance to the surface of the sea strikes the\r\nimagination most powerfully where the plains are altogether destitute\r\nof palm-trees; and where the mountains of the shore and of the Orinoco\r\nare so distant that they cannot be seen, as in the Mesa de Pavones. A\r\nperson would be tempted there to take the altitude of the sun with a\r\nquadrant, if the horizon of the land were not constantly misty on\r\naccount of the variable effects of refraction. This equality of\r\nsurface is still more perfect in the meridian of Calabozo, than\r\ntowards the east, between Cari, La Villa del Pao, and Nueva Barcelona;\r\nbut it extends without interruption from the mouths of the Orinoco to\r\nLa Villa de Araure and to Ospinos, on a parallel of a hundred and\r\neighty leagues in length; and from San Carlos to the savannahs of\r\nCaqueat, on a meridian of two hundred leagues. It particularly\r\ncharacterises the New Continent, as it does the low steppes of Asia,\r\nbetween the Borysthenes and the Volga, between the Irtish and the Obi.\r\nThe deserts of central Africa, of Arabia, Syria, and Persia, Gobi, and\r\nCasna, present, on the contrary, many inequalities, ranges of hills,\r\nravines without water, and rocks which pierce the sands.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos, however, notwithstanding the apparent uniformity of their\r\nsurface, present two kinds of inequalities, which cannot escape the\r\nobservation of the traveller. The first is known by the name of banks\r\n(bancos); they are in reality shoals in the basin of the steppes,\r\nfractured strata of sandstone, or compact limestone, standing four or\r\nfive feet higher than the rest of the plain. These banks are sometimes\r\nthree or four leagues in length; they are entirely smooth, with a\r\nhorizontal surface; their existence is perceived only by examining\r\ntheir margins. The second species of inequality can be recognised only\r\nby geodesical or barometric levellings, or by the course of rivers. It\r\nis called a mesa or table, and is composed of small flats, or rather\r\nconvex eminences, that rise insensibly to the height of a few toises.\r\nSuch are, towards the east, in the province of Cumana, on the north of\r\nthe Villa de la Merced and Candelaria, the Mesas of Amana, of Guanipa,\r\nand of Jonoro, the direction of which is south-west and north-east;\r\nand which, in spite of their inconsiderable elevation, divide the\r\nwaters between the Orinoco and the northern coast of Terra Firma. The\r\nconvexity of the savannah alone occasions this partition: we there\r\nfind the dividing of the waters (divortia aquarum* (* \"C. Manlium\r\nprope jugis [Tauri] ad divortia aquarum castra posuisse.\" Livy lib. 38\r\nc. 75.)), as in Poland, where, far from the Carpathian mountains, the\r\nplain itself divides the waters between the Baltic and the Black Sea.\r\nGeographers, who suppose the existence of a chain of mountains\r\nwherever there is a line of division, have not failed to mark one in\r\nthe maps, at the sources of the Rio Neveri, the Unare, the Guarapiche,\r\nand the Pao. Thus the priests of Mongol race, according to ancient and\r\nsuperstitious custom, erect oboes, or little mounds of stone, on every\r\npoint where the rivers flow in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe uniform landscape of the Llanos; the extremely small number of\r\ntheir inhabitants; the fatigue of travelling beneath a burning sky,\r\nand an atmosphere darkened by dust; the view of that horizon, which\r\nseems for ever to fly before us; those lonely trunks of palm-trees,\r\nwhich have all the same aspect, and which we despair of reaching,\r\nbecause they are confounded with other trunks that rise by degrees on\r\nthe visual horizon; all these causes combine to make the steppes\r\nappear far more extensive than they are in reality. The planters who\r\ninhabit the southern declivity of the chain of the coast see the\r\nsteppes extend towards the south, as far as the eye can reach, like an\r\nocean of verdure. They know that from the Delta of the Orinoco to the\r\nprovince of Varinas, and thence, by traversing the banks of the Meta,\r\nthe Guaviare, and the Caguan, they can advance three hundred and\r\neighty leagues* (* This is the distance from Timbuctoo to the northern\r\ncoast of Africa.) into the plains, first from east to west, and then\r\nfrom north-east to south-east beyond the Equator, to the foot of the\r\nAndes of Pasto. They know by the accounts of travellers the Pampas of\r\nBuenos Ayres, which are also Llanos covered with fine grass, destitute\r\nof trees, and filled with oxen and horses become wild. They suppose\r\nthat, according to the greater part of our maps of America, this\r\ncontinent has only one chain of mountains, that of the Andes, which\r\nstretches from south to north; and they form a vague idea of the\r\ncontiguity of all the plains from the Orinoco and the Apure to the Rio\r\nde la Plata and the Straits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping here to give a mineralogical description of the\r\ntransverse chains which divide America from east to west, it will be\r\nsufficient to notice the general structure of a continent, the\r\nextremities of which, though situated in climates little analogous,\r\nnevertheless present several features of resemblance. In order to have\r\nan exact idea of the plains, their configuration, and their limits, we\r\nmust know the chains of mountains that form their boundaries. We have\r\nalready described the Cordillera of the coast, of which the highest\r\nsummit is the Silla de Caraccas, and which is linked by the Paramo de\r\nlas Rosas to the Nevada de Merida, and the Andes of New Grenada. We\r\nhave seen that, in the tenth degree of north latitude, it stretches\r\nfrom Quibor and Barquesimeto as far as the point of Paria. A second\r\nchain of mountains, or rather a less elevated but much larger group,\r\nextends between the parallels of 3 and 7 degrees from the mouths of\r\nthe Guaviare and the Meta to the sources of the Orinoco, the Marony,\r\nand the Essequibo, towards French and Dutch Guiana. I call this chain\r\nthe Cordillera of Parime, or of the great cataracts of the Orinoco. It\r\nmay be followed for a length of two hundred and fifty leagues; but it\r\nis less a chain, than a collection of granitic mountains, separated by\r\nsmall plains, without being everywhere disposed in lines. The group of\r\nthe mountains of Parime narrows considerably between the sources of\r\nthe Orinoco and the mountains of Demerara, in the Sierras of\r\nQuimiropaca and Pacaraimo, which divide the waters between the Carony\r\nand the Rio Parime, or Rio de Aguas Blancas. This is the scene of the\r\nexpeditions which were undertaken in search of El Dorado, and the\r\ngreat city of Manoa, the Timbuctoo of the New Continent. The\r\nCordillera of Parime does not join the Andes of New Grenada, but is\r\nseparated from them by a space eighty leagues broad. If we suppose it\r\nto have been destroyed in this space by some great revolution of the\r\nglobe (which is scarcely probable) we must admit that it anciently\r\nbranched off from the Andes between Santa Fe de Bogota and Pamplona.\r\nThis remark serves to fix more easily in the memory of the reader the\r\ngeographical position of a Cordillera till now very imperfectly known.\r\nA third chain of mountains unites in 16 and 18 degrees south latitude\r\n(by Santa Cruz de la Sierra, the Serranias of Aguapehy, and the famous\r\nCampos dos Parecis) the Andes of Peru, to the mountains of Brazil. It\r\nis the Cordillera of Chiquitos which widens in the Capitania de Minas\r\nGeraes, and divides the rivers flowing into the Amazon from those of\r\nthe Rio de la Plata,* (* There is only a portage or carrying-place of\r\n5322 bracas between the Guapore (a branch of the Marmore and of the\r\nMadeira), and the Rio Aguapehy (a branch of the Jaura and of the\r\nParaguay).) not only in the interior of the country, in the meridian\r\nof Villa Boa, but also at a few leagues from the coast, between Rio\r\nJaneiro and Bahia.* (* The Cordillera of Chiquitos and of Brazil\r\nstretches toward the south-east, in the government of the Rio Grande,\r\nbeyond the latitude of 30 degrees south.)\r\n\r\nThese three transverse chains, or rather these three groups of\r\nmountains stretching from west to east, within the limits of the\r\ntorrid zone, are separated by tracts entirely level, the plains of\r\nCaracas, or of the Lower Orinoco; the plains of the Amazon and the Rio\r\nNegro; and the plains of Buenos Ayres, or of La Plata. I use the term\r\nplains, because the Lower Orinoco and the Amazon, far from flowing in\r\na valley, form but a little furrow in the midst of a vast level. The\r\ntwo basins, placed at the extremities of South America, are savannahs\r\nor steppes, pasturage without trees; the intermediate basin, which\r\nreceives the equatorial rains during the whole year, is almost\r\nentirely one vast forest, through which no other roads are known save\r\nthe rivers. The strong vegetation which conceals the soil, renders\r\nalso the uniformity of its level less perceptible; and the plains of\r\nCaracas and La Plata bear no other name. The three basins we have just\r\ndescribed are called, in the language of the colonists, the Llanos of\r\nVarinas and of Caracas, the bosques or selvas (forests) of the Amazon,\r\nand the Pampas of Buenos Ayres. The trees not only for the most part\r\ncover the plains of the Amazon, from the Cordillera de Chiquitos, as\r\nfar as that of Parime; they also crown these two chains of mountains,\r\nwhich rarely attain the height of the Pyrenees.* (* We must except the\r\nmost western part of the Cordillera of Chiquitos, between Cochabamba\r\nand Santa Cruz de la Sierra where the summits are covered with snow;\r\nbut this colossal group almost belongs to the Andes de la Paz, of\r\nwhich it forms a promontory or spur, directed toward the east.) On\r\nthis account, the vast plains of the Amazon, the Madeira, and the Rio\r\nNegro, are not so distinctly bounded as the Llanos of Caracas, and the\r\nPampas of Buenos Ayres. As the region of forests comprises at once the\r\nplains and the mountains, it extends from 18 degrees south to 7 and 8\r\ndegrees north,* (* To the west, in consequence of the Llanos of Manso,\r\nand the Pampas de Huanacos, the forests do not extend generally beyond\r\nthe parallels of 18 or 19 degrees south latitude; but to the east, in\r\nBrazil (in the capitanias of San Pablo and Rio Grande) as well as in\r\nParaguay, on the borders of the Parana, they advance as far as 25\r\ndegrees south.) and occupies an extent of near a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand square leagues. This forest of South America, for in fact\r\nthere is only one, is six times larger than France. It is known to\r\nEuropeans only on the shores of a few rivers, by which it is\r\ntraversed; and has its openings, the extent of which is in proportion\r\nto that of the forests. We shall soon skirt the marshy savannahs,\r\nbetween the Upper Orinoco, the Conorichite, and the Cassiquiare, in\r\nthe latitude of 3 and 4 degrees. There are other openings, or as they\r\nare called, clear savannahs,* (* Savannas limpias, that is to say,\r\nclear of trees.) in the same parallel, between the sources of the Mao\r\nand the Rio de Aguas Blancas, south of the Sierra de Pacaraima. These\r\nlast savannahs, which are inhabited by Caribs, and nomad Macusis, lie\r\nnear the frontiers of Dutch and French Guiana.\r\n\r\nHaving noticed the geological constitution of South America, we shall\r\nnow mark its principal features. The western coasts are bordered by an\r\nenormous wall of mountains, rich in precious metals wherever volcanic\r\nfire has not pierced through the eternal snow. This is the Cordillera\r\nof the Andes. Summits of trap-porphyry rise beyond three thousand\r\nthree hundred toises, and the mean height of the chain* is one\r\nthousand eight hundred and fifty toises. (* In New Grenada, Quito, and\r\nPeru, according to measurements taken by Bouguer, La Condamine, and\r\nmyself.) It stretches in the direction of a meridian, and sends into\r\neach hemisphere a lateral branch, in the latitudes of 10 degrees\r\nnorth, and 16 and 18 degrees south. The first of these two branches,\r\nthat of the coast of Caracas, is of considerable length, and forms in\r\nfact a chain. The second branch, the Cordillera of Chiquitos and of\r\nthe sources of the Guapore, is very rich in gold, and widens toward\r\nthe east, in Brazil, into vast tablelands, having a mild and temperate\r\nclimate. Between these two transverse chains, contiguous to the Andes,\r\nan isolated group of granitic mountains is situated, from 3 to 7\r\ndegrees north latitude; which also runs parallel to the Equator, but,\r\nnot passing the meridian of 71 degrees, terminates abruptly towards\r\nthe west, and is not united to the Andes of New Grenada. These three\r\ntransverse chains have no active volcanoes; we know not whether the\r\nmost southern, like the two others, be destitute of trachytes or\r\ntrap-porphyry. None of their summits enter the limit of perpetual\r\nsnow; and the mean height of the Cordillera of La Parime, and of the\r\nlittoral chain of Caracas, does not reach six hundred toises, though\r\nsome of its summits rise fourteen hundred toises above the level of\r\nthe sea.* (* We do not reckon here, as belonging to the chain of the\r\ncoast, the Nevados and Paramos of Merida and of Truxillo, which are a\r\nprolongation of the Andes of New Grenada.) The three transverse chains\r\nare separated by plains entirely closed towards the west, and open\r\ntowards the east and south-east. When we reflect on their small\r\nelevation above the surface of the ocean, we are tempted to consider\r\nthem as gulfs stretching in the direction of the current of rotation.\r\nIf, from the effect of some peculiar attraction, the waters of the\r\nAtlantic were to rise fifty toises at the mouth of the Orinoco, and\r\ntwo hundred toises at the mouth of the Amazon, the flood would\r\nsubmerge more than the half of South America. The eastern declivity,\r\nor the foot of the Andes, now six hundred leagues distant from the\r\ncoast of Brazil, would become a shore beaten by the waves. This\r\nconsideration is the result of a barometric measurement, taken in the\r\nprovince of Jaen de Bracamoros, where the river Amazon issues from the\r\nCordilleras. I found the mean height of this immense river only one\r\nhundred and ninety-four toises above the present level of the\r\nAtlantic. The intermediate plains, however, covered with forests, are\r\nstill five times higher than the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, and the\r\ngrass-covered Llanos of Caracas and the Meta.\r\n\r\nThose Llanos which form the basin of the Orinoco, and which we crossed\r\ntwice in one year, in the months of March and July, communicate with\r\nthe basin of the Amazon and the Rio Negro, bounded on one side by the\r\nCordillera of Chiquitos, and on the other by the mountains of Parime.\r\nThe opening which is left between the latter and the Andes of New\r\nGrenada, occasions this communication. The aspect of the country here\r\nreminds us, but on a much larger scale, of the plains of Lombardy,\r\nwhich also are only fifty or sixty toises above the level of the\r\nocean; and are directed first from La Brenta to Turin, east and west;\r\nand then from Turin to Coni, north and south. If we were authorized,\r\nfrom other geological facts, to regard the three great plains of the\r\nLower Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Rio de la Plata as basins of\r\nancient lakes,* (* In Siberia, the great steppes between the Irtish\r\nand the Obi, especially that of Baraba, full of salt lakes (Tchabakly,\r\nTchany, Karasouk, and Topolony), appear to have been, according to the\r\nChinese traditions, even within historical times, an inland sea.) we\r\nshould imagine we perceived in the plains of the Rio Vichada and the\r\nMeta, a channel by which the waters of the upper lake (those of the\r\nplains of the Amazon) forced their way towards the lower basin, (that\r\nof the Llanos of Caracas,) separating the Cordillera of La Parime from\r\nthat of the Andes. This channel is a kind of land-strait. The ground,\r\nwhich is perfectly level between the Guaviare, the Meta, and the\r\nApure, displays no vestige of a violent irruption of the waters; but\r\non the edge of the Cordillera of Parime, between the latitudes of 4\r\nand 7 degrees, the Orinoco, flowing in a westerly direction from its\r\nsource to the mouth of the Guaviare, has forced its way through the\r\nrocks, directing its course from south to north. All the great\r\ncataracts, as we shall soon see, are within the latitudes just named.\r\nWhen the river has reached the mouth of the Apure in that very low\r\nground where the slope towards the north is met by the counter-slope\r\ntowards the south-east, that is to say, by the inclination of the\r\nplains which rise imperceptibly towards the mountains of Caracas, the\r\nriver turns anew and flows eastward. It appeared to me, that it was\r\nproper to fix the attention of the reader on these singular inflexions\r\nof the Orinoco because, belonging at once to two basins, its course\r\nmarks, in some sort, even on the most imperfect maps, the direction of\r\nthat part of the plains intervening between New Grenada and the\r\nwestern border of the mountains of La Parime.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos or steppes of the Lower Orinoco and of the Meta, like the\r\ndeserts of Africa, bear different names in different parts. From the\r\nmouths of the Dragon the Llanos of Cumana, of Barcelona, and of\r\nCaracas or Venezuela,* follow, running from east to west. (* The\r\nfollowing are subdivisions of these three great Llanos, as I marked\r\nthem down on the spot. The Llanos of Cumana and New Andalusia include\r\nthose of Maturin and Terecen, of Amana, Guanipa, Jonoro, and Cari. The\r\nLlanos of Nueva Barcelona comprise those of Aragua, Pariaguan, and\r\nVilla del Pao. We distinguish in the Llanos of Caracas those of\r\nChaguaramas, Uritucu, Calabozo or Guarico, La Portuguesa, San Carlos,\r\nand Araure.) Where the steppes turn towards the south and\r\nsouth-south-west, from the latitude of 8 degrees, between the\r\nmeridians of 70 and 73 degrees, we find from north to south, the\r\nLlanos of Varinas, Casanare, the Meta, Guaviare, Caguau, and Caqueta.*\r\n(* The inhabitants of these plains distinguish as subdivisions, from\r\nthe Rio Portuguesa to Caqueta, the Llanos of Guanare, Bocono, Nutrius\r\nor the Apure, Palmerito near Quintero, Guardalito and Arauca, the\r\nMeta, Apiay near the port of Pachaquiaro, Vichada, Guaviare, Arriari,\r\nInirida, the Rio Hacha, and Caguan. The limits between the savannahs\r\nand the forests, in the plains that extend from the sources of the Rio\r\nNegro to Putumayo, are not sufficiently known.) The plains of Varinas\r\ncontain some few monuments of the industry of a nation that has\r\ndisappeared. Between Mijagual and the Cano de la Hacha, we find some\r\nreal tumuli, called in the country the Serillos de los Indios. They\r\nare hillocks in the shape of cones, artificially formed of earth, and\r\nprobably contain bones, like the tumuli in the steppes of Asia. A fine\r\nroad is also discovered near Hato de la Calzada, between Varinas and\r\nCanagua, five leagues long, made before the conquest, in the most\r\nremote times, by the natives. It is a causeway of earth fifteen feet\r\nhigh, crossing a plain often overflowed. Did nations farther advanced\r\nin civilization descend from the mountains of Truxillo and Merido to\r\nthe plains of the Rio Apure? The Indians whom we now find between this\r\nriver and the Meta, are in too rude a state to think of making roads\r\nor raising tumuli.\r\n\r\nI calculated the area of these Llanos from the Caqueta to the Apure,\r\nand from the Apure to the Delta of the Orinoco, and found it to be\r\nseventeen thousand square leagues twenty to a degree. The part running\r\nfrom north to south is almost double that which stretches from east to\r\nwest, between the Lower Orinoco and the littoral chain of Caracas. The\r\nPampas on the north and north-west of Buenos Ayres, between this city\r\nand Cordova, Jujuy, and the Tucuman, are of nearly the same extent as\r\nthe Llanos; but the Pampas stretch still farther on to the length of\r\n18 degrees southward; and the land they occupy is so vast, that they\r\nproduce palm-trees at one of their extremities, while the other,\r\nequally low and level, is covered with eternal frost.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos of America, where they extend in the direction of a\r\nparallel of the equator, are three-fourths narrower then the great\r\ndesert of Africa. This circumstance is very important in a region\r\nwhere the winds constantly blow from east to west. The farther the\r\nplains stretch in this direction, the more ardent is their climate.\r\nThe great ocean of sand in Africa communicates by Yemen* with Gedrosia\r\nand Beloochistan, as far as the right bank of the Indus. (* We cannot\r\nbe surprised that the Arabic should be richer than any other language\r\nof the East in words expressing the ideas of desert, uninhabited\r\nplains, and plains covered with gramina. I could give a list of\r\nthirty-five of these words, which the Arabian authors employ without\r\nalways distinguishing them by the shades of meaning which each\r\nseparate word expresses. Makadh and kaah indicate, in preference,\r\nplains; bakaak, a table-land; kafr, mikfar, smlis, mahk, and habaucer,\r\na naked desert, covered with sand and gravel; tanufah, a steppe. Zahra\r\nmeans at once a naked desert and a savannah. The word steppe, or step,\r\nis Russian, and not Tartarian. In the Turco-Tartar dialect a heath is\r\ncalled tala or tschol. The word gobi, which Europeans have corrupted\r\ninto cobi, signifies in the Mongol tongue a naked desert. It is\r\nequivalent to the scha-mo or khan-hai of the Chinese. A steppe, or\r\nplain covered with herbs, is in Mongol, kudah; in Chinese, kouana.) It\r\nis from the effect of winds that have passed over the deserts situated\r\nto the east, that the little basin of the Red Sea, surrounded by\r\nplains which send forth from all sides radiant caloric, is one of the\r\nhottest regions of the globe. The unfortunate captain Tuckey relates,*\r\n(* Expedition to explore the river Zahir, 1818.) that the centigrade\r\nthermometer keeps there generally in the night at 34 degrees, and by\r\nday from 40 to 44 degrees. We shall soon see that, even in the\r\nwesternmost part of the steppes of Caracas, we seldom found the\r\ntemperature of the air, in the shade, above 37 degrees.\r\n\r\nThese physical considerations on the steppes of the New World are\r\nlinked with others more interesting, inasmuch as they are connected\r\nwith the history of our species. The great sea of sand in Africa, the\r\ndeserts without water, are frequented only by caravans, that take\r\nfifty days to traverse them.* (* This is the maximum of the time,\r\naccording to Major Rennell, Travels of Mungo Park volume 2.)\r\nSeparating the Negro race from the Moors, and the Berber and Kabyle\r\ntribes, the Sahara is inhabited only in the oases. It affords\r\npasturage only in the eastern part, where, from the effect of the\r\ntrade-winds, the layer of sand being less thick, the springs appear at\r\nthe surface of the earth. In America, the steppes, less vast, less\r\nscorching, fertilized by fine rivers, present fewer obstacles to the\r\nintercourse of nations. The Llanos separate the chain of the coast of\r\nCaracas and the Andes of New Grenada from the region of forests; from\r\nthat woody region of the Orinoco which, from the first discovery of\r\nAmerica, has been inhabited by nations more rude, and farther removed\r\nfrom civilization, than the inhabitants of the coast, and still more\r\nthan the mountaineers of the Cordilleras. The steppes, however, were\r\nno more heretofore the rampart of civilization than they are now the\r\nrampart of the liberty of the hordes that live in the forests. They\r\nhave not hindered the nations of the Lower Orinoco from going up the\r\nlittle rivers and making incursions to the north and the west. If,\r\naccording to the various distribution of animals on the globe, the\r\npastoral life could have existed in the New World--if, before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, the Llanos and the Pampas had been filled\r\nwith those numerous herds of cows and horses that graze there,\r\nColumbus would have found the human race in a state quite different.\r\nPastoral nations living on milk and cheese, real nomad races, would\r\nhave spread themselves over those vast plains which communicate with\r\neach other. They would have been seen at the period of great droughts,\r\nand even at that of inundations, fighting for the possession of\r\npastures; subjugating one another mutually; and, united by the common\r\ntie of manners, language, and worship, they would have risen to that\r\nstate of demi-civilization which we observe with surprise in the\r\nnations of the Mongol and Tartar race. America would then, like the\r\ncentre of Asia, have had its conquerors, who, ascending from the\r\nplains to the tablelands of the Cordilleras, and abandoning a\r\nwandering life, would have subdued the civilized nations of Peru and\r\nNew Grenada, overturned the throne of the Incas and of the Zaque,* and\r\nsubstituted for the despotism which is the fruit of theocracy, that\r\ndespotism which arises from the patriarchal government of a pastoral\r\npeople. (* The Zaque was the secular chief of Cundinamarca. His power\r\nwas shared with the high priest (lama) of Iraca.) In the New World the\r\nhuman race has not experienced these great moral and political\r\nchanges, because the steppes, though more fertile than those of Asia,\r\nhave remained without herds; because none of the animals that furnish\r\nmilk in abundance are natives of the plains of South America; and\r\nbecause, in the progressive unfolding of American civilization, the\r\nintermediate link is wanting that connects the hunting with the\r\nagricultural nations.\r\n\r\nWe have thought proper to bring together these general notions on the\r\nplains of the New Continent, and the contrast they exhibit to the\r\ndeserts of Africa and the fertile steppes of Asia, in order to give\r\nsome interest to the narrative of a journey across lands of so\r\nmonotonous an aspect. Having now accomplished this task, I shall trace\r\nthe route by which we proceeded from the volcanic mountains of\r\nParapara and the northern side of the Llanos, to the banks of the\r\nApure, in the province of Varinas.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed two nights on horseback, and sought in vain, by\r\nday, for some shelter from the heat of the sun beneath the tufts of\r\nthe moriche palm-trees, we arrived before night at the little Hato del\r\nCayman,* (* The Farm of the Alligator.) called also La Guadaloupe. It\r\nwas a solitary house in the steppes, surrounded by a few small huts,\r\ncovered with reeds and skins. The cattle, oxen, horses, and mules are\r\nnot penned, but wander freely over an extent of several square\r\nleagues. There is nowhere any enclosure; men, naked to the waist and\r\narmed with a lance, ride over the savannahs to inspect the animals;\r\nbringing back those that wander too far from the pastures of the farm,\r\nand branding all that do not already bear the mark of their\r\nproprietor. These mulattos, who are known by the name of peones\r\nllaneros, are partly freed-men and partly slaves. They are constantly\r\nexposed to the burning heat of the tropical sun. Their food is meat,\r\ndried in the air, and a little salted; and of this even their horses\r\nsometimes partake. Being always in the saddle, they fancy they cannot\r\nmake the slightest excursion on foot. We found an old negro slave, who\r\nmanaged the farm in the absence of his master. He told us of herds\r\ncomposed of several thousand cows, that were grazing in the steppes;\r\nyet we asked in vain for a bowl of milk. We were offered, in a\r\ncalabash, some yellow, muddy, and fetid water, drawn from a\r\nneighbouring pool. The indolence of the inhabitants of the Llanos is\r\nsuch that they do not dig wells, though they know that almost\r\neverywhere, at ten feet deep, fine springs are found in a stratum of\r\nconglomerate, or red sandstone. After suffering during one half of the\r\nyear from the effect of inundations, they quietly resign themselves,\r\nduring the other half; to the most distressing deprivation of water.\r\nThe old negro advised us to cover the cup with a linen cloth, and\r\ndrink as through a filter, that we might not be incommoded by the\r\nsmell, and might swallow less of the yellowish mud suspended in the\r\nwater. We did not then think that we should afterwards be forced,\r\nduring whole months, to have recourse to this expedient. The waters of\r\nthe Orinoco are always loaded with earthy particles; they are even\r\nputrid, where dead bodies of alligators are found in the creeks, lying\r\non banks of sand, or half-buried in the mud.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were our instruments unloaded and safely placed, than our\r\nmules were set at liberty to go, as they say here, para buscar agua,\r\nthat is, \"to search for water.\" There are little pools round the farm,\r\nwhich the animals find, guided by their instinct, by the view of some\r\nscattered tufts of mauritia, and by the sensation of humid coolness,\r\ncaused by little currents of air amid an atmosphere which to us\r\nappears calm and tranquil. When the pools of water are far distant,\r\nand the people of the farm are too lazy to lead the cattle to these\r\nnatural watering-places, they confine them during five or six hours in\r\na very hot stable before they let them loose. Excess of thirst then\r\naugments their sagacity, sharpening as it were their senses and their\r\ninstinct. No sooner is the stable opened, than the horses and mules,\r\nespecially the latter (for the penetration of these animals exceeds\r\nthe intelligence of the horses), rush into the savannahs. With\r\nupraised tails and heads thrown back they run against the wind,\r\nstopping from time to time as if exploring space; they follow less the\r\nimpressions of sight than of smell; and at length announce, by\r\nprolonged neighings, that there is water in the direction of their\r\ncourse. All these movements are executed more promptly, and with\r\nreadier success, by horses born in the Llanos, and which have long\r\nenjoyed their liberty, than by those that come from the coast, and\r\ndescend from domestic horses. In animals, for the most part, as in\r\nman, the quickness of the senses is diminished by long subjection, and\r\nby the habits that arise from a fixed abode and the progress of\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWe followed our mules in search of one of those pools, whence the\r\nmuddy water had been drawn, that so ill quenched our thirst. We were\r\ncovered with dust, and tanned by the sandy wind, which burns the skin\r\neven more than the rays of the sun. We longed impatiently to take a\r\nbath, but we found only a great pool of feculent water, surrounded\r\nwith palm-trees. The water was turbid, though, to our great\r\nastonishment, a little cooler than the air. Accustomed during our long\r\njourney to bathe whenever we had an opportunity, often several times\r\nin one day, we hastened to plunge into the pool. We had scarcely begun\r\nto enjoy the coolness of the bath, when a noise which we heard on the\r\nopposite bank, made us leave the water precipitately. It was an\r\nalligator plunging into the mud.\r\n\r\nWe were only at the distance of a quarter of a league from the farm,\r\nyet we continued walking more than an hour without reaching it. We\r\nperceived too late that we had taken a wrong direction. Having left it\r\nat the decline of day, before the stars were visible, we had gone\r\nforward into the plain at hazard. We were, as usual, provided with a\r\ncompass, and it might have been easy for us to steer our course from\r\nthe position of Canopus and the Southern Cross; but unfortunately we\r\nwere uncertain whether, on leaving the farm, we had gone towards the\r\neast or the south. We attempted to return to the spot where we had\r\nbathed, and we again walked three quarters of an hour without finding\r\nthe pool. We sometimes thought we saw fire on the horizon; but it was\r\nthe light of the rising stars enlarged by the vapours. After having\r\nwandered a long time in the savannah, we resolved to seat ourselves\r\nbeneath the trunk of a palm-tree, in a spot perfectly dry, surrounded\r\nby short grass; for the fear of water-snakes is always greater than\r\nthat of jaguars among Europeans recently disembarked. We could not\r\nflatter ourselves that our guides, of whom we knew the insuperable\r\nindolence, would come in search of us in the savannah before they had\r\nprepared their food and finished their repast. Whilst somewhat\r\nperplexed by the uncertainty of our situation, we were agreeably\r\naffected by hearing from afar the sound of a horse advancing towards\r\nus. The rider was an Indian, armed with a lance, who had just made the\r\nrodeo, or round, in order to collect the cattle within a determinate\r\nspace of ground. The sight of two white men, who said they had lost\r\ntheir way, led him at first to suspect some trick. We found it\r\ndifficult to inspire him with confidence; he at last consented to\r\nguide us to the farm of the Cayman, but without slackening the gentle\r\ntrot of his horse. Our guides assured us that \"they had already begun\r\nto be uneasy about us;\" and, to justify this inquietude, they gave a\r\nlong enumeration of persons who, having lost themselves in the Llanos,\r\nhad been found nearly exhausted. It may be supposed that the danger is\r\nimminent only to those who lose themselves far from any habitation, or\r\nwho, having been stripped by robbers, as has happened of late years,\r\nhave been fastened by the body and hands to the trunk of a palm-tree.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape as much as possible from the heat of the day, we\r\nset off at two in the morning, with the hope of reaching Calabozo\r\nbefore noon, a small but busy trading-town, situated in the midst of\r\nthe Llanos. The aspect of the country was still the same. There was no\r\nmoonlight; but the great masses of nebulae that spot the southern sky\r\nenlighten, as they set, a part of the terrestrial horizon. The solemn\r\nspectacle of the starry vault, seen in its immense expanse--the cool\r\nbreeze which blows over the plain during the night--the waving motion\r\nof the grass, wherever it has attained any height; everything recalled\r\nto our minds the surface of the ocean. The illusion was augmented when\r\nthe disk of the sun appearing on the horizon, repeated its image by\r\nthe effects of refraction, and, soon losing its flattened form,\r\nascended rapidly and straight towards the zenith.\r\n\r\nSunrise in the plains is the coolest moment of the day; but this\r\nchange of temperature does not make a very lively impression on the\r\norgans. We did not find the thermometer in general sink below 27.5;\r\nwhile near Acapulco, at Mexico, and in places equally low, the\r\ntemperature at noon is often 32, and at sunrise only 17 or 18 degrees.\r\nThe level surface of the ground in the Llanos, which, during the day,\r\nis never in the shade, absorbs so much heat that, notwithstanding the\r\nnocturnal radiation toward a sky without clouds, the earth and air\r\nhave not time to cool very sensibly from midnight to sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the sun rose towards the zenith, and the earth and\r\nthe strata of superincumbent air took different temperatures, the\r\nphenomenon of the mirage displayed itself in its numerous\r\nmodifications. This phenomenon is so common in every zone, that I\r\nmention it only because we stopped to measure with some precision the\r\nbreadth of the aerial distance between the horizon and the suspended\r\nobject. There was a constant suspension, without inversion. The little\r\ncurrents of air that swept the surface of the soil had so variable a\r\ntemperature that, in a drove of wild oxen, one part appeared with the\r\nlegs raised above the surface of the ground, while the other rested on\r\nit. The aerial distance was, according to the distance of the animal,\r\nfrom 3 to 4 minutes. Where tufts of the moriche palm were found\r\ngrowing in long ranges, the extremities of these green rows were\r\nsuspended like the capes which were, for so long a time, the subject\r\nof my observations at Cumana. A well-informed person assured us, that\r\nhe had seen, between Calabozo and Uritucu, the image of an animal\r\ninverted, without there being any direct image. Niebuhr made a similar\r\nobservation in Arabia. We several times thought we saw on the horizon\r\nthe figures of tumuli and towers, which disappeared at intervals,\r\nwithout our being able to discern the real shape of the objects. They\r\nwere perhaps hillocks, or small eminences, situated beyond the\r\nordinary visual horizon. I need not mention those tracts destitute of\r\nvegetation, which appear like large lakes with an undulating surface.\r\nThis phenomenon, observed in very remote times, has occasioned the\r\nmirage to receive in Sanscrit the expressive name of desire of the\r\nantelope. We admire the frequent allusions in the Indian, Persian, and\r\nArabic poets, to the magical effects of terrestrial refraction. It was\r\nscarcely known to the Greeks and Romans. Proud of the riches of their\r\nsoil, and the mild temperature of the air, they would have felt no\r\nenvy of this poetry of the desert. It had its birth in Asia; and the\r\noriental poets found its source in the nature of the country they\r\ninhabited. They were inspired with the aspect of those vast solitudes,\r\ninterposed like arms of the sea or gulfs, between lands which nature\r\nhad adorned with her most luxuriant fertility.\r\n\r\nThe plain assumes at sunrise a more animated aspect. The cattle, which\r\nhad reposed during the night along the pools, or beneath clumps of\r\nmauritias and rhopalas, were now collected in herds; and these\r\nsolitudes became peopled with horses, mules, and oxen, that live here\r\nfree, rather than wild, without settled habitations, and disdaining\r\nthe care and protection of man. In these hot climates, the oxen,\r\nthough of Spanish breed, like those of the cold table-lands of Quito,\r\nare of a gentle disposition. A traveller runs no risk of being\r\nattacked or pursued, as we often were in our excursions on the back of\r\nthe Cordilleras, where the climate is rude, the aspect of the country\r\nmore wild, and food less abundant. As we approached Calabozo, we saw\r\nherds of roebucks browsing peacefully in the midst of horses and oxen.\r\nThey are called matacani; their flesh is good; they are a little\r\nlarger than our roes, and resemble deer with a very sleek skin, of a\r\nfawn-colour, spotted with white. Their horns appear to me to have\r\nsingle points. They had little fear of the presence of man: and in\r\nherds of thirty or forty we observed several that were entirely white.\r\nThis variety, common enough among the large stags of the cold climates\r\nof the Andes, surprised us in these low and burning plains. I have\r\nsince learned, that even the jaguar, in the hot regions of Paraguay,\r\nsometimes affords albino varieties, the skin of which is of such\r\nuniform whiteness that the spots or rings can be distinguished only in\r\nthe sunshine. The number of matacani, or little deer,* (* They are\r\ncalled in the country Venados de tierras calientes (deer of the warm\r\nlands.)) is so considerable in the Llanos, that a trade might be\r\ncarried on with their skins.* (* This trade is carried on, but on a\r\nvery limited scale, at Carora and at Barquesimeto.) A skilful hunter\r\ncould easily kill more than twenty in a day; but such is the indolence\r\nof the inhabitants, that often they will not give themselves the\r\ntrouble of taking the skin. The same indifference is evinced in the\r\nchase of the jaguar, a skin of which fetches only one piastre in the\r\nsteppes of Varinas, while at Cadiz it costs four or five.\r\n\r\nThe steppes that we traversed are principally covered with grasses of\r\nthe genera Killingia, Cenchrus, and Paspalum.* (* Killingia\r\nmonocephala, K. odorata, Cenchrus pilosus, Vilfa tenacissima,\r\nAndropogon plumosum, Panicum micranthum, Poa repens, Paspalum\r\nleptostachyum, P. conjugatum, Aristida recurvata. (Nova Genera et\r\nSpecies Plantarum, volume 1 pages 84 to 243.) At this season, near\r\nCalabozo and San Jerome del Pirital, these grasses scarcely attain the\r\nheight of nine or ten inches. Near the banks of the Apure and the\r\nPortuguesa they rise to four feet in height, so that the jaguar can\r\nconceal himself among them, to spring upon the mules and horses that\r\ncross the plain. Mingled with these gramina some plants of the\r\ndicotyledonous class are found; as turneras, malvaceae, and, what is\r\nvery remarkable, little mimosas with irritable leaves,* called by the\r\nSpaniards dormideras. (* The sensitive-plant Mimosa dormiens.) The\r\nsame breed of cows, which fatten in Europe on sainfoin and clover,\r\nfind excellent nourishment in the herbaceous sensitive plants. The\r\npastures where these shrubs particularly abound are sold at a higher\r\nprice than others. To the east, in the llanos of Cari and Barcelona,\r\nthe cypura and the craniolaria,* (* Cypura graminea, Craniolaria\r\nannua, the scorzonera of the natives.) the beautiful white flower of\r\nwhich is from six to eight inches long, rise solitarily amid the\r\ngramina. The pastures are richest not only around the rivers subject\r\nto inundations, but also wherever the trunks of palm-trees are near\r\neach other. The least fertile spots are those destitute of trees; and\r\nattempts to cultivate them would be nearly fruitless. We cannot\r\nattribute this difference to the shelter afforded by the palm-trees,\r\nin preventing the solar rays from drying and burning up the soil. I\r\nhave seen, it is true, trees of this family, in the forests of the\r\nOrinoco, spreading a tufted foliage; but we cannot say much for the\r\nshade of the palm-tree of the llanos, the palma de cobija,* (* The\r\nroofing palm-tree Corypha tectorum.) which has but a few folded and\r\npalmate leaves, like those of the chamaerops, and of which the\r\nlower-most are constantly withered. We were surprised to see that\r\nalmost all these trunks of the corypha were nearly of the same size,\r\nnamely, from twenty to twenty-four feet high, and from eight to ten\r\ninches diameter at the foot. Nature has produced few species of\r\npalm-trees in such prodigious numbers. Amidst thousands of trunks\r\nloaded with olive-shaped fruits we found about one hundred without\r\nfruit. May we suppose that there are some trees with flowers purely\r\nmonoecious, mingled with others furnished with hermaphrodite flowers?\r\n\r\nThe Llaneros, or inhabitants of the plains, believe that all these\r\ntrees, though so low, are many centuries old. Their growth is almost\r\nimperceptible, being scarcely to be noticed in the lapse of twenty or\r\nthirty years. The wood of the palma de cobija is excellent for\r\nbuilding. It is so hard, that it is difficult to drive a nail into it.\r\nThe leaves, folded like a fan, are employed to cover the roofs of the\r\nhuts scattered through the Llanos; and these roofs last more than\r\ntwenty years. The leaves are fixed by bending the extremity of the\r\nfootstalks, which have been beaten beforehand between two stones, so\r\nthat they may bend without breaking.\r\n\r\nBeside the solitary trunks of this palm-tree, we find dispersed here\r\nand there in the steppes a few clumps, real groves (palmares), in\r\nwhich the corypha is intermingled with a tree of the proteaceous\r\nfamily, called chaparro by the natives. It is a new species of\r\nrhopala,* (* Resembling the Embothrium, of which we found no species\r\nin South America. The embothriums are represented in American\r\nvegetation by the genera Lomatia and Oreocallis.) with hard and\r\nresonant leaves. The little groves of rhopala are called chaparales;\r\nand it may be supposed that, in a vast plain, where only two or three\r\nspecies of trees are to be found, the chaparro, which affords shade,\r\nis considered a highly valuable plant. The corypha spreads through the\r\nLlanos of Caracas from Mesa de Peja as far as Guayaval; farther north\r\nand north-west, near Guanare and San Carlos, its place is taken by\r\nanother species of the same genus, with leaves alike palmate but\r\nlarger. It is called the royal palm of the plains (palma real de los\r\nLlanos).* (* This palm-tree of the plains must not be confounded with\r\nthe palma real of Caracas and of Curiepe, with pinnate leaves.) Other\r\npalm-trees rise south of Guayaval, especially the piritu with pinnate\r\nleaves,* (* Perhaps an Aiphanes.) and the moriche (Mauritia flexuosa),\r\ncelebrated by Father Gumilla under the name of arbol de la vida, or\r\ntree of life. It is the sago-tree of America, furnishing flour, wine,\r\nthread for weaving hammocks, baskets, nets, and clothing. Its fruit,\r\nof the form of the cones of the pine, and covered with scales,\r\nperfectly resembles that of the Calamus rotang. It has somewhat the\r\ntaste of the apple. When arrived at its maturity it is yellow within\r\nand red without. The araguato monkeys eat it with avidity; and the\r\nnation of the Guaraounos, whose whole existence, it may be said, is\r\nclosely linked with that of the moriche palm-tree, produce from it a\r\nfermented liquor, slightly acid, and extremely refreshing. This\r\npalm-tree, with its large shining leaves, folded like a fan, preserves\r\na beautiful verdure at the period of the greatest drought. The mere\r\nsight of it produces an agreeable sensation of coolness, and when\r\nloaded with scaly fruit, it contrasts singularly with the mournful\r\naspect of the palma de cobija, the foliage of which is always grey and\r\ncovered with dust. The Llaneros believe that the former attracts the\r\nvapours in the air;* (* If the head of the moriche were better\r\nfurnished with leaves than it generally is, we might perhaps admit\r\nthat the soil round the tree preserves its humidity through the\r\ninfluence of the shade.) and that for this reason, water is constantly\r\nfound at its foot, when dug for to a certain depth. The effect is\r\nconfounded with the cause. The moriche grows best in moist places; and\r\nit may rather be said that the water attracts the tree. The natives of\r\nthe Orinoco, by analogous reasoning, admit, that the great serpents\r\ncontribute to preserve humidity in a province. \"You would look in vain\r\nfor water-serpents,\" said an old Indian of Javita to us gravely,\r\n\"where there are no marshes; because the water ceases to collect when\r\nyou imprudently kill the serpents that attract it.\"\r\n\r\nWe suffered greatly from the heat in crossing the Mesa de Calabozo.\r\nThe temperature of the air augmented sensibly every time that the wind\r\nbegan to blow. The air was loaded with dust; and during these gusts\r\nthe thermometer rose to 40 or 41 degrees. We went slowly forward, for\r\nit would have been dangerous to leave the mules that carried our\r\ninstruments. Our guides advised us to fill our hats with the leaves of\r\nthe rhopala, to diminish the action of the solar rays on the hair and\r\nthe crown of the head. We found relief from this expedient, which was\r\nparticularly agreeable, when we could procure the thick leaves of the\r\npothos or some other similar plant.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to cross these burning plains, without inquiring\r\nwhether they have always been in the same state; or whether they have\r\nbeen stripped of their vegetation by some revolution of nature. The\r\nstratum of mould now found on them is in fact very thin. The natives\r\nbelieve that the palmares and the chaparales (the little groves of\r\npalm-trees and rhopala) were more frequent and more extensive before\r\nthe arrival of the Spaniards. Since the Llanos have been inhabited and\r\npeopled with cattle become wild, the savannah is often set on fire, in\r\norder to ameliorate the pasturage. Groups of scattered trees are\r\naccidentally destroyed with the grasses. The plains were no doubt less\r\nbare in the fifteenth century, than they now are; yet the first\r\nConquistadores, who came from Coro, described them then as savannahs,\r\nwhere nothing could be perceived but the sky and the turf, generally\r\ndestitute of trees, and difficult to traverse on account of the\r\nreverberation of heat from the soil. Why does not the great forest of\r\nthe Orinoco extend to the north, on the left bank of that river? Why\r\ndoes it not fill that vast space that reaches as far as the Cordillera\r\nof the coast, and which is fertilized by numerous rivers? These\r\nquestions are connected with all that relates to the history of our\r\nplanet. If, indulging in geological reveries, we suppose that the\r\nsteppes of America, and the desert of Sahara, have been stripped of\r\ntheir vegetation by an irruption of the ocean, or that they formed\r\noriginally the bottom of an inland sea, we may conceive that thousands\r\nof years have not sufficed for the trees and shrubs to advance from\r\nthe borders of the forests, from the skirts of the plains either naked\r\nor covered with turf, toward the centre, and darken so vast a space\r\nwith their shade. It is more difficult to explain the origin of bare\r\nsavannahs, encircled by forests, than to recognize the causes that\r\nmaintain forests and savannahs within their ancient limits, like\r\ncontinents and seas.\r\n\r\nWe found the most cordial hospitality at Calabozo, in the house of the\r\nsuperintendent of the royal plantations, Don Miguel Cousin. The town,\r\nsituated between the banks of the Guarico and the Uritucu, contained\r\nat this period only five thousand inhabitants; but everything denoted\r\nincreasing prosperity. The wealth of most of the inhabitants consists\r\nin herds, under the management of farmers, who are called hateros,\r\nfrom the word hato, which signifies in Spanish a house or farm placed\r\nin the midst of pastures. The scattered population of the Llanos being\r\naccumulated on certain points, principally around towns, Calabozo\r\nreckons already five villages or missions in its environs. It is\r\ncomputed, that 98,000 head of cattle wander in the pastures nearest to\r\nthe town. It is very difficult to form an exact idea of the herds\r\ncontained in the Llanos of Caracas, Barcelona, Cumana, and Spanish\r\nGuiana. M. Depons, who lived in the town of Caracas longer than I, and\r\nwhose statistical statements are generally accurate, reckons in those\r\nvast plains, from the mouths of the Orinoco to the lake of Maracaybo,\r\n1,200,000 oxen, 180,000 horses, and 90,000 mules. He estimates the\r\nproduce of these herds at 5,000,000 francs; adding to the value of the\r\nexportation the price of the hides consumed in the country. There\r\nexist, it is believed, in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, 12,000,000 cows,\r\nand 3,000,000 horses, without comprising in this enumeration the\r\ncattle that have no acknowledged proprietor.\r\n\r\nI shall not hazard any general estimates, which from their nature are\r\ntoo uncertain; but shall only observe that, in the Llanos of Caracas,\r\nthe proprietors of the great hatos are entirely ignorant of the number\r\nof the cattle they possess. They only know that of the young cattle,\r\nwhich are branded every year with a letter or mark peculiar to each\r\nherd. The richest proprietors mark as many as 14,000 head every year;\r\nand sell to the number of five or six thousand. According to official\r\ndocuments, the exportation of hides from the whole capitania-general\r\nof Caracas amounted annually to 174,000 skins of oxen, and 11,500 of\r\ngoats. When we reflect, that these documents are taken from the books\r\nof the custom-houses, where no mention is made of the fraudulent\r\ndealings in hides, we are tempted to believe that the estimate of\r\n1,200,000 oxen wandering in the Llanos, from the Rio Carony and the\r\nGuarapiche to the lake of Maracaybo, is much underrated. The port of\r\nLa Guayra alone exported annually from 1789 to 1792, 70,000 or 80,000\r\nhides, entered in the custom-house books, scarcely one-fifth of which\r\nwas sent to Spain. The exportation from Buenos Ayres, at the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, was, according to Don Felix de Azara, 800,000\r\nskins. The hides of Caracas are preferred in the Peninsula to those of\r\nBuenos Ayres; because the latter, on account of a longer passage,\r\nundergo a loss of twelve per cent in the tanning. The southern part of\r\nthe savannahs, commonly called the Upper Plains (Llanos de arriba), is\r\nvery productive in mules and oxen; but the pasturage being in general\r\nless good, these animals are obliged to be sent to other plains to be\r\nfattened before they are sold. The Llano de Monai, and all the Lower\r\nPlains (Llanos de abaxo), abound less in herds, but the pastures are\r\nso fertile, that they furnish meat of an excellent quality for the\r\nsupply of the coast. The mules, which are not fit for labour before\r\nthe fifth year, are purchased on the spot at the price of fourteen or\r\neighteen piastres. The horses of the Llanos, descending from the fine\r\nSpanish breed, are not very large; they are generally of a uniform\r\ncolour, brown bay, like most of the wild animals. Suffering\r\nalternately from drought and floods, tormented by the stings of\r\ninsects and the bites of the large bats, they lead a sorry life. After\r\nhaving enjoyed for some months the care of man, their good qualities\r\nare developed. Here there are no sheep: we saw flocks only on the\r\ntable-land of Quito.\r\n\r\nThe hatos of oxen have suffered considerably of late from troops of\r\nmarauders, who roam over the steppes killing the animals merely to\r\ntake their hides. This robbery has increased since the trade of the\r\nLower Orinoco has become more flourishing. For half a century, the\r\nbanks of that great river, from the mouth of the Apure as far as\r\nAngostura, were known only to the missionary-monks. The exportation of\r\ncattle took place from the ports of the northern coast only, namely\r\nfrom Cumana, Barcelona, Burburata, and Porto Cabello. This dependence\r\non the coast is now much diminished. The southern part of the plains\r\nhas established an internal communication with the Lower Orinoco; and\r\nthis trade is the more brisk, as those who devote themselves to it\r\neasily escape the trammels of the prohibitory laws.\r\n\r\nThe greatest herds of cattle in the Llanos of Caracas are those of the\r\nhatos of Merecure, La Cruz, Belen, Alta Gracia, and Pavon. The Spanish\r\ncattle came from Coro and Tocuyo into the plains. History has\r\npreserved the name of the colonist who first conceived the idea of\r\npeopling these pasturages, inhabited only by deer, and a large species\r\nof cavy.* (* The thick-nosed tapir, or river cavy (Cavia capybara),\r\ncalled chiguire in those countries.) Christoval Rodriguez sent the\r\nfirst horned cattle into the Llanos, about the year 1548. He was an\r\ninhabitant of the town of Tocuyo, and had long resided in New Grenada.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear of the innumerable quantity of oxen, horses, and mules,\r\nthat are spread over the plains of America, we seem generally to\r\nforget that in civilized Europe, on lands of much less extent, there\r\nexist, in agricultural countries, quantities no less prodigious.\r\nFrance, according to M. Peuchet, feeds 6,000,000 large horned cattle,\r\nof which 3,500,000 are oxen employed in drawing the plough. In the\r\nAustrian monarchy, the number of oxen, cows, and calves, has been\r\nestimated at 13,400,000 head. Paris alone consumes annually 155,000\r\nhorned cattle. Germany receives 150,000 oxen yearly from Hungary.\r\nDomestic animals, collected in small herds, are considered by\r\nagricultural nations as a secondary object in the riches of the state.\r\nAccordingly they strike the imagination much less than those wandering\r\ndroves of oxen and horses which alone fill the uncultivated tracts of\r\nthe New World. Civilization and social order favour alike the progress\r\nof population, and the multiplication of animals useful to man.\r\n\r\nWe found at Calabozo, in the midst of the Llanos, an electrical\r\nmachine with large plates, electrophori, batteries, electrometers; an\r\napparatus nearly as complete as our first scientific men in Europe\r\npossess. All these articles had not been purchased in the United\r\nStates; they were the work of a man who had never seen any instrument,\r\nwho had no person to consult, and who was acquainted with the\r\nphenomena of electricity only by reading the treatise of De Lafond,\r\nand Franklin's Memoirs. Senor Carlos del Pozo, the name of this\r\nenlightened and ingenious man, had begun to make cylindrical\r\nelectrical machines, by employing large glass jars, after having cut\r\noff the necks. It was only within a few years he had been able to\r\nprocure, by way of Philadelphia, two plates, to construct a plate\r\nmachine, and to obtain more considerable effects. It is easy to judge\r\nwhat difficulties Senor Pozo had to encounter, since the first works\r\nupon electricity had fallen into his hands, and that he had the\r\ncourage to resolve to procure himself, by his own industry, all that\r\nhe had seen described in his books. Till now he had enjoyed only the\r\nastonishment and admiration produced by his experiments on persons\r\ndestitute of all information, and who had never quitted the solitude\r\nof the Llanos; our abode at Calabozo gave him a satisfaction\r\naltogether new. It may be supposed that he set some value on the\r\nopinions of two travellers who could compare his apparatus with those\r\nconstructed in Europe. I had brought with me electrometers mounted\r\nwith straw, pith-balls, and gold-leaf; also a small Leyden jar which\r\ncould be charged by friction according to the method of Ingenhousz,\r\nand which served for my physiological experiments. Senor del Pozo\r\ncould not contain his joy on seeing for the first time instruments\r\nwhich he had not made, yet which appeared to be copied from his own.\r\nWe also showed him the effect of the contact of heterogeneous metals\r\non the nerves of frogs. The name of Galvani and Volta had not\r\npreviously been heard in those vast solitudes.\r\n\r\nNext to his electrical apparatus, the work of the industry and\r\nintelligence of an inhabitant of the Llanos, nothing at Calabozo\r\nexcited in us so great an interest as the gymnoti, which are animated\r\nelectrical apparatuses. I was impatient, from the time of my arrival\r\nat Cumana, to procure electrical eels. We had been promised them\r\noften, but our hopes had always been disappointed. Money loses its\r\nvalue as you withdraw from the coast; and how is the imperturbable\r\napathy of the ignorant people to be vanquished, when they are not\r\nexcited by the desire of gain?\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards confound all electric fishes under the name of\r\ntembladores.* (* Literally \"tremblers,\" or \"producers of trembling.\")\r\nThere are some of these in the Caribbean Sea, on the coast of Cumana.\r\nThe Guayquerie Indians, who are the most skilful and active fishermen\r\nin those parts, brought us a fish, which, they said, benumbed their\r\nhands. This fish ascends the little river Manzanares. It is a new\r\nspecies of ray, the lateral spots of which are scarcely visible, and\r\nwhich much resembles the torpedo. The torpedos, which are furnished\r\nwith an electric organ externally visible, on account of the\r\ntransparency of the skin, form a genus or subgenus different from the\r\nrays properly so called.* (* Cuvier, Regne Animal volume 2. The\r\nMediterranean contains, according to M. Risso, four species of\r\nelectrical torpedos, all formerly confounded under the name of Raia\r\ntorpedo; these are Torpedo narke, T. unimaculata, T. galvanii, and T.\r\nmarmorata. The torpedo of the Cape of Good Hope, the subject of the\r\nrecent experiments of Mr. Todd, is, no doubt, a nondescript species.)\r\nThe torpedo of Cumana was very lively, very energetic in its muscular\r\nmovements, and yet the electric shocks it gave us were extremely\r\nfeeble. They became stronger on galvanizing the animal by the contact\r\nof zinc and gold. Other tembladores, real gymnoti or electric eels,\r\ninhabit the Rio Colorado, the Guarapiche, and several little streams\r\nwhich traverse the Missions of the Chayma Indians. They abound also in\r\nthe large rivers of America, the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Meta;\r\nbut the force of the currents and the depth of the water, prevent them\r\nfrom being caught by the Indians. They see these fish less frequently\r\nthan they feel shocks from them when swimming or bathing in the river.\r\nIn the Llanos, particularly in the environs of Calabozo, between the\r\nfarms of Morichal and the Upper and Lower Missions, the basins of\r\nstagnant water and the confluents of the Orinoco (the Rio Guarico and\r\nthe canos Rastro, Berito, and Paloma) are filled with electric eels.\r\nWe at first wished to make our experiments in the house we inhabited\r\nat Calabozo; but the dread of the shocks caused by the gymnoti is so\r\ngreat, and so exaggerated among the common people, that during three\r\ndays we could not obtain one, though they are easily caught, and we\r\nhad promised the Indians two piastres for every strong and vigorous\r\nfish. This fear of the Indians is the more extraordinary, as they do\r\nnot attempt to adopt precautions in which they profess to have great\r\nconfidence. When interrogated on the effect of the tembladores, they\r\nnever fail to tell the Whites, that they may be touched with impunity\r\nwhile you are chewing tobacco. This supposed influence of tobacco on\r\nanimal electricity is as general on the continent of South America, as\r\nthe belief among mariners of the effect of garlic and tallow on the\r\nmagnetic needle.\r\n\r\nImpatient of waiting, and having obtained very uncertain results from\r\nan electric eel which had been brought to us alive, but much\r\nenfeebled, we repaired to the Cano de Bera, to make our experiments in\r\nthe open air, and at the edge of the water. We set off on the 19th of\r\nMarch, at a very early hour, for the village of Rastro; thence we were\r\nconducted by the Indians to a stream, which, in the time of drought,\r\nforms a basin of muddy water, surrounded by fine trees,* (* Amyris\r\nlateriflora, A. coriacea, Laurus pichurin. Myroxylon secundum,\r\nMalpighia reticulata.) the clusia, the amyris, and the mimosa with\r\nfragrant flowers. To catch the gymnoti with nets is very difficult, on\r\naccount of the extreme agility of the fish, which bury themselves in\r\nthe mud. We would not employ the barbasco, that is to say, the roots\r\nof the Piscidea erithyrna, the Jacquinia armillaris, and some species\r\nof phyllanthus, which thrown into the pool, intoxicate or benumb the\r\neels. These methods have the effect of enfeebling the gymnoti. The\r\nIndians therefore told us that they would \"fish with horses,\"\r\n(embarbascar con caballos.* (* Meaning to excite the fish by horses.))\r\nWe found it difficult to form an idea of this extraordinary manner of\r\nfishing; but we soon saw our guides return from the savannah, which\r\nthey had been scouring for wild horses and mules. They brought about\r\nthirty with them, which they forced to enter the pool.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary noise caused by the horses' hoofs, makes the fish\r\nissue from the mud, and excites them to the attack. These yellowish\r\nand livid eels, resembling large aquatic serpents, swim on the surface\r\nof the water, and crowd under the bellies of the horses and mules. A\r\ncontest between animals of so different an organization presents a\r\nvery striking spectacle. The Indians, provided with harpoons and long\r\nslender reeds, surround the pool closely; and some climb up the trees,\r\nthe branches of which extend horizontally over the surface of the\r\nwater. By their wild cries, and the length of their reeds, they\r\nprevent the horses from running away and reaching the bank of the\r\npool. The eels, stunned by the noise, defend themselves by the\r\nrepeated discharge of their electric batteries. For a long interval\r\nthey seem likely to prove victorious. Several horses sink beneath the\r\nviolence of the invisible strokes which they receive from all sides,\r\nin organs the most essential to life; and stunned by the force and\r\nfrequency of the shocks, they disappear under the water. Others,\r\npanting, with mane erect, and haggard eyes expressing anguish and\r\ndismay, raise themselves, and endeavour to flee from the storm by\r\nwhich they are overtaken. They are driven back by the Indians into the\r\nmiddle of the water; but a small number succeed in eluding the active\r\nvigilance of the fishermen. These regain the shore, stumbling at every\r\nstep, and stretch themselves on the sand, exhausted with fatigue, and\r\nwith limbs benumbed by the electric shocks of the gymnoti.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes two of our horses were drowned. The eel\r\nbeing five feet long, and pressing itself against the belly of the\r\nhorses, makes a discharge along the whole extent of its electric\r\norgan. It attacks at once the heart, the intestines, and the caeliac\r\nfold of the abdominal nerves. It is natural that the effect felt by\r\nthe horses should be more powerful than that produced upon man by the\r\ntouch of the same fish at only one of his extremities. The horses are\r\nprobably not killed, but only stunned. They are drowned from the\r\nimpossibility of rising amid the prolonged struggle between the other\r\nhorses and the eels.\r\n\r\nWe had little doubt that the fishing would terminate by killing\r\nsuccessively all the animals engaged; but by degrees the impetuosity\r\nof this unequal combat diminished, and the wearied gymnoti dispersed.\r\nThey require a long rest, and abundant nourishment, to repair the\r\ngalvanic force which they have lost.* (* The Indians assured us that\r\nwhen the horses are made to run two days successively into the same\r\npool, none are killed the second day. See, on the fishing for gymnoti\r\nViews of Nature Bohn's edition page 18.) The mules and horses appear\r\nless frightened; their manes are no longer bristled, and their eyes\r\nexpress less dread. The gymnoti approach timidly the edge of the\r\nmarsh, where they are taken by means of small harpoons fastened to\r\nlong cords. When the cords are very dry the Indians feel no shock in\r\nraising the fish into the air. In a few minutes we had five large\r\neels, most of which were but slightly wounded. Some others were taken,\r\nby the same means, towards evening.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the waters in which the gymnoti habitually live, is\r\nfrom 26 to 27 degrees. Their electric force diminishes it is said, in\r\ncolder waters; and it is remarkable that, in general, animals endowed\r\nwith electromotive organs, the effects of which are sensible to man,\r\nare not found in the air, but in a fluid that is a conductor of\r\nelectricity. The gymnotus is the largest of electrical fishes. I\r\nmeasured some that were from five feet to five feet three inches long;\r\nand the Indians assert that they have seen them still larger. We found\r\nthat a fish of three feet ten inches long weighed twelve pounds. The\r\ntransverse diameter of the body, without reckoning the anal fin, which\r\nis elongated in the form of a keel, was three inches and a half. The\r\ngymnoti of the Cano de Bera are of a fine olive-green. The under part\r\nof the head is yellow mingled with red. Two rows of small yellow spots\r\nare placed symmetrically along the back, from the head to the end of\r\nthe tail. Every spot contains an excretory aperture. In consequence,\r\nthe skin of the animal is constantly covered with a mucous matter,\r\nwhich, as Volta has proved, conducts electricity twenty or thirty\r\ntimes better than pure water. It is in general somewhat remarkable,\r\nthat no electric fish yet discovered in the different parts of the\r\nworld, is covered with scales.* (* We yet know with certainty only\r\nseven electric fishes; Torpedo narke, Risso, T. unimaculata, T.\r\nmarmorata, T. galvanii, Silurus electricus, Tetraodon electricus,\r\nGymnotus electricus. It appears uncertain whether the Trichiurus\r\nindicus has electrical properties or not. See Cuvier's Regne Animal\r\nvolume 2. But the genus Torpedo, very different from that of the rays\r\nproperly so called, has numerous species in the equatorial seas; and\r\nit is probable that there exist several gymnoti specifically\r\ndifferent. The Indians mentioned to us a black and very powerful\r\nspecies, inhabiting the marshes of the Apure, which never attains a\r\nlength of more than two feet, but which we were not able to procure.\r\nThe raton of the Rio de la Magdalena, which I have described under the\r\nname of Gymnotus aequilabiatus (Observations de Zoologie volume 1)\r\nforms a particular sub-genus. This is a Carapa, not scaly, and without\r\nan electric organ. This organ is also entirely wanting in the\r\nBrazilian Carapo, and in all the rays which were carefully examined by\r\nCuvier.)\r\n\r\nThe gymnoti, like our eels, are fond of swallowing and breathing air\r\non the surface of the water; but we must not thence conclude that the\r\nfish would perish if it could not come up to breathe the air. The\r\nEuropean eel will creep during the night upon the grass; but I have\r\nseen a very vigorous gymnotus that had sprung out of the water, die on\r\nthe ground. M. Provencal and myself have proved by our researches on\r\nthe respiration of fishes, that their humid bronchiae perform the\r\ndouble function of decomposing the atmospheric air, and of\r\nappropriating the oxygen contained in water. They do not suspend their\r\nrespiration in the air; but they absorb the oxygen like a reptile\r\nfurnished with lungs. It is known that carp may be fattened by being\r\nfed, out of the water, if their gills are wet from time to time with\r\nhumid moss, to prevent them from becoming dry. Fish separate their\r\ngill-covers wider in oxygen gas than in water. Their temperature\r\nhowever, does not rise; and they live the same length of time in pure\r\nvital air, and in a mixture of ninety parts nitrogen and ten oxygen.\r\nWe found that tench placed under inverted jars filled with air, absorb\r\nhalf a cubic centimetre of oxygen in an hour. This action takes place\r\nin the gills only; for fishes on which a collar of cork has been\r\nfastened, and leaving their head out of the jar filled with air, do\r\nnot act upon the oxygen by the rest of their body.\r\n\r\nThe swimming-bladder of the gymnotus is two feet five inches long in a\r\nfish of three feet ten inches.* (* Cuvier has shown that in the\r\nGymnotus electricus there exists, besides the large swimming-bladder,\r\nanother situated before it, and much smaller. It looks like the\r\nbifurcated swimming-bladder in the Gymnotus aequilabiatus.) It is\r\nseparated by a mass of fat from the external skin; and rests upon the\r\nelectric organs, which occupy more than two-thirds of the animal's\r\nbody. The same vessels which penetrate between the plates or leaves of\r\nthese organs, and which cover them with blood when they are cut\r\ntransversely, also send out numerous branches to the exterior surface\r\nof the air-bladder. I found in a hundred parts of the air of the\r\nswimming-bladder four of oxygen and ninety-six of nitrogen. The\r\nmedullary substance of the brain displays but a feeble analogy with\r\nthe albuminous and gelatinous matter of the electric organs. But these\r\ntwo substances have in common the great quantity of arterial blood\r\nwhich they receive, and which is deoxidated in them. We may again\r\nremark, on this occasion, that an extreme activity in the functions of\r\nthe brain causes the blood to flow more abundantly towards the head,\r\nas the energy of the movement of the muscles accelerates the\r\ndeoxidation of the arterial blood. What a contrast between the\r\nmultitude and the diameter of the blood-vessels of the gymnotus, and\r\nthe small space occupied by its muscular system! This contrast reminds\r\nthe observer, that three functions of animal life, which appear in\r\nother respects sufficiently distinct--the functions of the brain,\r\nthose of the electrical organ, and those of the muscles, all require\r\nthe afflux and concourse of arterial or oxygenated blood.\r\n\r\nIt would be temerity to expose ourselves to the first shocks of a very\r\nlarge and strongly irritated gymnotus. If by chance a stroke be\r\nreceived before the fish is wounded or wearied by long pursuit, the\r\npain and numbness are so violent that it is impossible to describe the\r\nnature of the feeling they excite. I do not remember having ever\r\nreceived from the discharge of a large Leyden jar, a more dreadful\r\nshock than that which I experienced by imprudently placing both my\r\nfeet on a gymnotus just taken out of the water. I was affected during\r\nthe rest of the day with a violent pain in the knees, and in almost\r\nevery joint. To be aware of the difference that exists between the\r\nsensation produced by the Voltaic battery and an electric fish, the\r\nlatter should be touched when they are in a state of extreme weakness.\r\nThe gymnoti and the torpedos then cause a twitching of the muscles,\r\nwhich is propagated from the part that rests on the electric organs,\r\nas far as the elbow. We seem to feel, at every stroke, an internal\r\nvibration, which lasts two or three seconds, and is followed by a\r\npainful numbness. Accordingly, the Tamanac Indians call the gymnotus,\r\nin their expressive language, arimna, which means something that\r\ndeprives of motion.\r\n\r\nThe sensation caused by the feeble shocks of an electric eel appeared\r\nto me analogous to that painful twitching with which I have been\r\nseized at each contact of two heterogeneous metals applied to wounds\r\nwhich I had made on my back by means of cantharides. This difference\r\nof sensation between the effects of electric fishes and those of a\r\nVoltaic battery or a Leyden jar feebly charged has struck every\r\nobserver; there is, however, nothing in this contrary to the\r\nsupposition of the identity of electricity and the galvanic action of\r\nfishes. The electricity may be the same; but its effects will be\r\nvariously modified by the disposition of the electrical apparatus, by\r\nthe intensity of the fluid, by the rapidity of the current, and by the\r\nparticular mode of action.\r\n\r\nIn Dutch Guiana, at Demerara for instance, electric eels were formerly\r\nemployed to cure paralytic affections. At a time when the physicians\r\nof Europe had great confidence in the effects of electricity, a\r\nsurgeon of Essequibo, named Van der Lott, published in Holland a\r\ntreatise on the medical properties of the gymnotus. These electric\r\nremedies are practised among the savages of America, as they were\r\namong the Greeks. We are told by Scribonius Largus, Galen, and\r\nDioscorides, that torpedos cure the headache and the gout. I did not\r\nhear of this mode of treatment in the Spanish colonies which I\r\nvisited; and I can assert that, after having made experiments during\r\nfour hours successively with gymnoti, M. Bonpland and myself felt,\r\ntill the next day, a debility in the muscles, a pain in the joints,\r\nand a general uneasiness, the effect of a strong irritation of the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nThe gymnotus is neither a charged conductor, nor a battery, nor an\r\nelectromotive apparatus, the shock of which is received every time\r\nthey are touched with one hand, or when both hands are applied to form\r\na conducting circle between the opposite poles. The electric action of\r\nthe fish depends entirely on its will; because it does not keep its\r\nelectric organs always charged, or whether by the secretion of some\r\nfluid, or by any other means alike mysterious to us, it be capable of\r\ndirecting the action of its organs to an external object. We often\r\ntried, both insulated and otherwise, to touch the fish, without\r\nfeeling the least shock. When M. Bonpland held it by the head, or by\r\nthe middle of the body, while I held it by the tail, and, standing on\r\nthe moist ground, did not take each other's hand, one of us received\r\nshocks, which the other did not feel. It depends upon the gymnotus to\r\ndirect its action towards the point where it finds itself most\r\nstrongly irritated. The discharge is then made at one point only, and\r\nnot at the neighbouring points. If two persons touch the belly of the\r\nfish with their fingers, at an inch distance, and press it\r\nsimultaneously, sometimes one, sometimes the other, will receive the\r\nshock. In the same manner, when one insulated person holds the tail of\r\na vigorous gymnotus, and another pinches the gills or pectoral fin, it\r\nis often the first only by whom the shock is received. It did not\r\nappear to us that these differences could be attributed to the dryness\r\nor moisture of our hands, or to their unequal conducting power. The\r\ngymnotus seemed to direct its strokes sometimes from the whole surface\r\nof its body, sometimes from one point only. This effect indicates less\r\na partial discharge of the organ composed of an innumerable quantity\r\nof layers, than the faculty which the animal possesses, (perhaps by\r\nthe instantaneous secretion of a fluid spread through the cellular\r\nmembrane,) of establishing the communication between its organs and\r\nthe skin only, in a very limited space.\r\n\r\nNothing proves more strongly the faculty, which the gymnotus\r\npossesses, of darting and directing its stroke at will, than the\r\nobservations made at Philadelphia and Stockholm,* on gymnoti rendered\r\nextremely tame. (* By MM. Williamson and Fahlberg. The following\r\naccount is given by the latter gentleman. \"The gymnotus sent from\r\nSurinam to M. Norderling, at Stockholm, lived more than four months in\r\na state of perfect health. It was twenty-seven inches long; and the\r\nshocks it gave were so violent, especially in the open air, that I\r\nfound scarcely any means of protecting myself by non-conductors, in\r\ntransporting the fish from one place to another. Its stomach being\r\nvery small, it ate little at a time, but fed often. It approached\r\nliving fish, first sending them from afar a shock, the energy of which\r\nwas proportionate to the size of the prey. The gymnotus seldom failed\r\nin its aim; one single stroke was almost always sufficient to overcome\r\nthe resistance which the strata of water, more or less thick according\r\nto the distance, opposed to the electrical current. When very much\r\npressed by hunger, it sometimes directed the shocks against the person\r\nwho daily brought its food of boiled meat. Persons afflicted with\r\nrheumatism came to touch it in hopes of being cured. They took it at\r\nonce by the neck and tail the shocks were in this case stronger than\r\nwhen touched with one hand only. It almost entirely lost its\r\nelectrical power a short time before its death.\") When they had been\r\nmade to fast a long time, they killed small fishes put into the tub.\r\nThey acted from a distance; that is to say, their electrical shock\r\npassed through a very thick stratum of water. We need not be surprised\r\nthat what was observed in Sweden, on a single gymnotus only, we could\r\nnot perceive in a great number of individuals in their native country.\r\nThe electric action of animals being a vital action, and subject to\r\ntheir will, it does not depend solely on their state of health and\r\nvigour. A gymnotus that has been kept a long time in captivity,\r\naccustoms itself to the imprisonment to which it is reduced; it\r\nresumes by degrees the same habits in the tub, which it had in the\r\nrivers and marshes. An electrical eel was brought to me at Calabozo:\r\nit had been taken in a net, and consequently having no wound. It ate\r\nmeat, and terribly frightened the little tortoises and frogs which,\r\nnot aware of their danger, placed themselves on its back. The frogs\r\ndid not receive the stroke till the moment when they touched the body\r\nof the gymnotus. When they recovered, they leaped out of the tub; and\r\nwhen replaced near the fish, they were frightened at the mere sight of\r\nit. We then observed nothing that indicated an action at a distance;\r\nbut our gymnotus, recently taken, was not yet sufficiently tame to\r\nattack and devour frogs. On approaching the finger, or the metallic\r\npoints, very close to the electric organs, no shock was felt. Perhaps\r\nthe animal did not perceive the proximity of a foreign body; or, if it\r\ndid, we must suppose that in the commencement of its captivity,\r\ntimidity prevented it from darting forth its energetic strokes except\r\nwhen strongly irritated by an immediate contact. The gymnotus being\r\nimmersed in water, I placed my hand, both armed and unarmed with\r\nmetal, within a very small distance from the electric organs; yet the\r\nstrata of water transmitted no shock, while M. Bonpland irritated the\r\nanimal strongly by an immediate contact, and received some very\r\nviolent shocks. Had we placed a very delicate electroscope in the\r\ncontiguous strata of water, it might possibly have been influenced at\r\nthe moment when the gymnotus seemed to direct its stroke elsewhere.\r\nPrepared frogs, placed immediately on the body of a torpedo,\r\nexperience, according to Galvani, a strong contraction at every\r\ndischarge of the fish.\r\n\r\nThe electrical organ of the gymnoti acts only under the immediate\r\ninfluence of the brain and the heart. On cutting a very vigorous fish\r\nthrough the middle of the body, the fore part alone gave shocks. These\r\nare equally strong in whatever part of the body the fish is touched;\r\nit is most disposed, however, to emit them when the pectoral fin, the\r\nelectrical organ, the lips, the eyes, or the gills, are pinched.\r\nSometimes the animal struggles violently with a person holding it by\r\nthe tail, without communicating the least shock. Nor did I feel any\r\nwhen I made a slight incision near the pectoral fin of the fish, and\r\ngalvanized the wound by the contact of two pieces of zinc and silver.\r\nThe gymnotus bent itself convulsively, and raised its head out of the\r\nwater, as if terrified by a sensation altogether new; but I felt no\r\nvibration in the hands which held the two metals. The most violent\r\nmuscular movements are not always accompanied by electric discharges.\r\n\r\nThe action of the fish on the human organs is transmitted and\r\nintercepted by the same bodies that transmit and intercept the\r\nelectrical current of a conductor charged by a Leyden jar, or Voltaic\r\nbattery. Some anomalies, which we thought we observed, are easily\r\nexplained, when we recollect that even metals (as is proved from their\r\nignition when exposed to the action of the battery) present a slight\r\nobstacle to the passage of electricity; and that a bad conductor\r\nannihilates the effect, on our organs, of a feeble electric charge,\r\nwhilst it transmits to us the effect of a very strong one. The\r\nrepulsive force which zinc and silver exercise together being far\r\nsuperior to that of gold and silver, I have found that when a frog,\r\nprepared and armed with silver, is galvanized under water, the\r\nconducting arc of zinc produces contraction as soon as one of its\r\nextremities approaches the muscles within three lines distance; while\r\nan arc of gold does not excite the organs, when the stratum of water\r\nbetween the gold and the muscles is more than half a line thick. In\r\nthe same manner, by employing a conducting arc composed of two pieces\r\nof zinc and silver soldered together endways; and resting, as before,\r\none of the extremities of the metallic circuit on the femoral nerve,\r\nit is necessary, in order to produce contractions, to bring the other\r\nextremity of the conductor nearer and nearer to the muscles, in\r\nproportion as the irritability of the organs diminishes. Toward the\r\nend of the experiment the slightest stratum of water prevents the\r\npassage of the electrical current, and it is only by the immediate\r\ncontact of the arc with the muscles, that the contractions take place.\r\nThese effects are, however, dependent on three variable circumstances;\r\nthe energy of the electromotive apparatus, the conductibility of the\r\nmedium, and the irritability of the organs which receive the\r\nimpressions: it is because experiments have not been sufficiently\r\nmultiplied with a view to these three variable elements, that, in the\r\naction of electric eels and torpedos, accidental circumstances have\r\nbeen taken for absolute conditions, without which the electric shocks\r\nare not felt.\r\n\r\nIn wounded gymnoti, which give feeble but very equal shocks, these\r\nshocks appeared to us constantly stronger on touching the body of the\r\nfish with a hand armed with metal, than with the naked hand. They are\r\nstronger also, when, instead of touching the fish with one hand,\r\nnaked, or armed with metal, we press it at once with both hands,\r\neither naked or armed. These differences become sensible only when one\r\nhas gymnoti enough at disposal to be able to choose the weakest; and\r\nwhen the extreme equality of the electric discharges admits of\r\ndistinguishing between the sensations felt alternately by the hand\r\nnaked or armed with a metal, by one or both hands naked, and by one or\r\nboth hands armed with metal. It is also in the case only of small\r\nshocks, feeble and uniform, that they are more sensible on touching\r\nthe gymnotus with one hand (without forming a chain) with zinc, than\r\nwith copper or iron.\r\n\r\nResinous substances, glass, very dry wood, horn, and even bones, which\r\nare generally believed to be good conductors, prevent the action of\r\nthe gymnoti from being transmitted to man. I was surprised at not\r\nfeeling the least shock on pressing wet sticks of sealing-wax against\r\nthe organs of the fish, while the same animal gave me the most violent\r\nstrokes, when excited by means of a metallic rod. M. Bonpland received\r\nshocks, when carrying a gymnotus on two cords of the fibres of the\r\npalm-tree, which appeared to us extremely dry. A strong discharge\r\nmakes its way through very imperfect conductors. Perhaps also the\r\nobstacle which the conductor presents renders the discharge more\r\npainful. I touched the gymnotus with a wet pot of brown clay, without\r\neffect; yet I received violent shocks when I carried the gymnotus in\r\nthe same pot, because the contact was greater.\r\n\r\nWhen two persons, insulated or otherwise, hold each other's hands, and\r\nonly one of these persons touches the fish with the hand, either naked\r\nor armed with metal, the shock is most commonly felt by both at once.\r\nHowever, it sometimes happens that, in the most severe shocks, the\r\nperson who comes into immediate contact with the fish alone feels\r\nthem. When the gymnotus is exhausted, or in a very reduced state of\r\nexcitability, and will no longer emit strokes on being irritated with\r\none hand, the shocks are felt in a very vivid manner, on forming the\r\nchain, and employing both hands. Even then, however, the electric\r\nshock takes place only at the will of the animal. Two persons, one of\r\nwhom holds the tail, and the other the head, cannot, by joining hands\r\nand forming a chain, force the gymnotus to dart his stroke.\r\n\r\nThough employing the most delicate electrometers in various ways,\r\ninsulating them on a plate of glass, and receiving very strong shocks\r\nwhich passed through the electrometer, I could never discover any\r\nphenomenon of attraction or repulsion. The same observation was made\r\nby M. Fahlberg at Stockholm. That philosopher, however, has seen an\r\nelectric spark, as Walsh and Ingenhousz had before him, in London, by\r\nplacing the gymnotus in the air, and interrupting the conducting chain\r\nby two gold leaves pasted upon glass, and a line distant from each\r\nother. No person, on the contrary, has ever perceived a spark issue\r\nfrom the body of the fish itself. We irritated it for a long time\r\nduring the night, at Calabozo, in perfect darkness, without observing\r\nany luminous appearance. Having placed four gymnoti, of unequal\r\nstrength, in such a manner as to receive the shocks of the most\r\nvigorous fish by contact, that is to say, by touching only one of the\r\nother fishes, I did not observe that these last were agitated at the\r\nmoment when the current passed their bodies. Perhaps the current did\r\nnot penetrate below the humid surface of the skin. We will not,\r\nhowever, conclude from this, that the gymnoti are insensible to\r\nelectricity; and that they cannot fight with each other at the bottom\r\nof the pools. Their nervous system must be subject to the same agents\r\nas the nerves of other animals. I have indeed seen, that, on laying\r\nopen their nerves, they undergo muscular contractions at the mere\r\ncontact of two opposite metals; and M. Fahlberg, of Stockholm, found\r\nthat his gymnotus was convulsively agitated when placed in a copper\r\nvessel, and feeble discharges from a Leyden jar passed through its\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nAfter the experiments I had made on gymnoti, it became highly\r\ninteresting to me, on my return to Europe, to ascertain with precision\r\nthe various circumstances in which another electric fish, the torpedo\r\nof our seas, gives or does not give shocks. Though this fish had been\r\nexamined by numerous men of science, I found all that had been\r\npublished on its electrical effects extremely vague. It has been very\r\narbitrarily supposed, that this fish acts like a Leyden jar, which may\r\nbe discharged at will, by touching it with both hands; and this\r\nsupposition appears to have led into error observers who have devoted\r\nthemselves to researches of this kind. M. Gay-Lussac and myself,\r\nduring our journey to Italy, made a great number of experiments on\r\ntorpedos taken in the gulf of Naples. These experiments furnish many\r\nresults somewhat different from those I collected on the gymnoti. It\r\nis probable that the cause of these anomalies is owing rather to the\r\ninequality of electric power in the two fishes, than to the different\r\ndisposition of their organs.\r\n\r\nThough the power of the torpedo cannot be compared with that of the\r\ngymnotus, it is sufficient to cause very painful sensations. A person\r\naccustomed to electric shocks can with difficulty hold in his hands a\r\ntorpedo of twelve or fourteen inches, and in possession of all its\r\nvigour. When the torpedo gives only very feeble strokes under water,\r\nthey become more sensible if the animal be raised above the surface. I\r\nhave often observed the same phenomenon in experimenting on frogs.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo moves the pectoral fins convulsively every time it emits a\r\nstroke; and this stroke is more or less painful, according as the\r\nimmediate contact takes place by a greater or less surface. We\r\nobserved that the gymnotus gives the strongest shocks without making\r\nany movement with the eyes, head, or fins.* (* The anal fin of the\r\ngymnoti only has a sensible motion when these fishes are excited under\r\nthe belly, where the electric organ is placed.) Is this difference\r\ncaused by the position of the electric organ, which is not double in\r\nthe gymnoti? or does the movement of the pectoral fins of the torpedo\r\ndirectly prove that the fish restores the electrical equilibrium by\r\nits own skin, discharges itself by its own body, and that we generally\r\nfeel only the effect of a lateral shock?\r\n\r\nWe cannot discharge at will either a torpedo or a gymnotus, as we\r\ndischarge at will a Leyden jar or a Voltaic battery. A shock is not\r\nalways felt, even on touching the electric fish with both hands. We\r\nmust irritate it to make it give the shock. This action in the\r\ntorpedos, as well as in the gymnoti, is a vital action; it depends on\r\nthe will only of the animal, which perhaps does not always keep its\r\nelectric organs charged, or does not always employ the action of its\r\nnerves to establish the chain between the positive and negative poles.\r\nIt is certain that the torpedo gives a long series of shocks with\r\nastonishing celerity; whether it is that the plates or laminae of its\r\norgans are not wholly exhausted, or that the fish recharges them\r\ninstantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe electric stroke is felt, when the animal is disposed to give it,\r\nwhether we touch with a single finger only one of the surfaces of the\r\norgans, or apply both hands to the two surfaces, the superior and\r\ninferior, at once. In either case it is altogether indifferent whether\r\nthe person who touches the fish with one finger or both hands be\r\ninsulated or not. All that has been said on the necessity of a\r\ncommunication with the damp ground to establish a circuit, is founded\r\non inaccurate observations.\r\n\r\nM. Gay-Lussac made the important observation that when an insulated\r\nperson touches the torpedo with one finger, it is indispensible that\r\nthe contact be direct. The fish may with impunity be touched with a\r\nkey, or any other metallic instrument; no shock is felt when a\r\nconducting or non-conducting body is interposed between the finger and\r\nthe electrical organ of the torpedo. This circumstance proves a great\r\ndifference between the torpedo and the gymnotus, the latter giving his\r\nstrokes through an iron rod several feet long.\r\n\r\nWhen the torpedo is placed on a metallic plate of very little\r\nthickness, so that the plate touches the inferior surface of the\r\norgans, the hand that supports the plate never feels any shock, though\r\nanother insulated person may excite the animal, and the convulsive\r\nmovement of the pectoral fins may denote the strongest and most\r\nreiterated discharges.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, a person support the torpedo placed upon a\r\nmetallic plate, with the left hand, as in the foregoing experiment,\r\nand the same person touch the superior surface of the electrical organ\r\nwith the right hand, a strong shock is then felt in both arms. The\r\nsensation is the same when the fish is placed between two metallic\r\nplates, the edges of which do not touch, and the person applies both\r\nhands at once to these plates. The interposition of one metallic plate\r\nprevents the communication if that plate be touched with one hand\r\nonly, while the interposition of two metallic plates does not prevent\r\nthe shock when both hands are applied. In the latter case it cannot be\r\ndoubted that the circulation of the fluid is established by the two\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIf, in this situation of the fish between two plates, there exist any\r\nimmediate communication between the edges of these two plates, no\r\nshock takes place. The chain between the two surfaces of the electric\r\norgan is then formed by the plates, and the new communication,\r\nestablished by the contact of the two hands with the two plates,\r\nremains without effect. We carried the torpedo with impunity between\r\ntwo plates of metal, and felt the strokes it gave only at the instant\r\nwhen they ceased to touch each other at the edges.\r\n\r\nNothing in the torpedo or in the gymnotus indicates that the animal\r\nmodifies the electrical state of the bodies by which it is surrounded.\r\nThe most delicate electrometer is no way affected in whatever manner\r\nit is employed, whether bringing it near the organs or insulating the\r\nfish, covering it with a metallic plate, and causing the plate to\r\ncommunicate by a conducting wire with the condenser of Volta. We were\r\nat great pains to vary the experiments by which we sought to render\r\nthe electrical tension of the torpedo sensible; but they were\r\nconstantly without effect, and perfectly confirmed what M. Bonpland\r\nand myself had observed respecting the gymnoti, during our abode in\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nElectrical fishes, when very vigorous, act with equal energy under\r\nwater and in the air. This observation led us to examine the\r\nconducting property of water; and we found that, when several persons\r\nform the chain between the superior and inferior surface of the organs\r\nof the torpedo, the shock is felt only when these persons join hands.\r\nThe action is not intercepted if two persons, who support the torpedo\r\nwith their right hands, instead of taking one another by the left\r\nhand, plunge each a metallic point into a drop of water placed on an\r\ninsulating substance. On substituting flame for the drop of water, the\r\ncommunication is interrupted, and is only re-established, as in the\r\ngymnotus, when the two points immediately touch each other in the\r\ninterior of the flame.\r\n\r\nWe are, doubtless, very far from having discovered all the secrets of\r\nthe electrical action of fishes which is modified by the influence of\r\nthe brain and the nerves; but the experiments we have just described\r\nare sufficient to prove that these fishes act by a concealed\r\nelectricity, and by electromotive organs of a peculiar construction,\r\nwhich are recharged with extreme rapidity. Volta admits that the\r\ndischarges of the opposite electricities in the torpedos and the\r\ngymnoti are made by their own skin, and that when we touch them with\r\none hand only, or by means of a metallic point, we feel the effect of\r\na lateral shock, the electrical current not being directed solely the\r\nshortest way. When a Leyden jar is placed on a wet woollen cloth\r\n(which is a bad conductor), and the jar is discharged in such a manner\r\nthat the cloth makes part of the chain, prepared frogs, placed at\r\ndifferent distances, indicate by their contractions that the current\r\nspreads itself over the whole cloth in a thousand different ways.\r\nAccording to this analogy, the most violent shock given by the\r\ngymnotus at a distance would be but a feeble part of the stroke which\r\nre-establishes the equilibrium in the interior of the fish.* (* The\r\nheterogeneous poles of the double electrical organs must exist in each\r\norgan. Mr. Todd has recently proved, by experiments made on torpedos\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, that the animal continues to give violent\r\nshocks when one of these organs is extirpated. On the contrary, all\r\nelectrical action is stopped (and this point, as elucidated by\r\nGalvani, is of the greatest importance) if injury be inflicted on the\r\nbrain, or if the nerves which supply the plates of the electrical\r\norgans be divided. In the latter case, the nerves being cut, and the\r\nbrain left untouched, the torpedo continues to live, and perform every\r\nmuscular movement. A fish, exhausted by too numerous electrical\r\ndischarges, suffered much more than another fish deprived, by dividing\r\nthe nerves, of any communication between the brain and the\r\nelectromotive apparatus. Philosophical Transactions 1816.) As the\r\ngymnotus directs its stroke wherever it pleases, it must also be\r\nadmitted that the discharge is not made by the whole skin at once, but\r\nthat the animal, excited perhaps by the motion of a fluid poured into\r\none part of the cellular membrane, establishes at will the\r\ncommunication between its organs and some particular part of the skin.\r\nIt may be conceived that a lateral stroke, out of the direct current,\r\nmust become imperceptible under the two conditions of a very weak\r\ndischarge, or a very great obstacle presented by the nature and length\r\nof the conductor. Notwithstanding these considerations, it appears to\r\nme very surprising that shocks of the torpedo, strong in appearance,\r\nare not propagated to the hand when a very thin plate of metal is\r\ninterposed between it and the fish.\r\n\r\nSchilling declared that the gymnotus approached the magnet\r\ninvoluntarily. We tried in a thousand ways this supposed influence of\r\nthe magnet on the electrical organs, without having ever observed any\r\nsensible effect. The fish no more approached the magnet, than a bar of\r\niron not magnetic. Iron-filings, thrown on its back, remained\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nThe gymnoti, which are objects of curiosity and of the deepest\r\ninterest to the philosophers of Europe, are at once dreaded and\r\ndetested by the natives. They furnish, indeed, in their muscular\r\nflesh, pretty good aliment; but the electric organ fills the greater\r\npart of their body, and this organ is slimy, and disagreeable to the\r\ntaste; it is accordingly separated with care from the rest of the eel.\r\nThe presence of gymnoti is also considered as the principal cause of\r\nthe want of fish in the ponds and pools of the Llanos. They, however,\r\nkill many more than they devour: and the Indians told us, that when\r\nyoung alligators and gymnoti are caught at the same time in very\r\nstrong nets, the latter never show the slightest trace of a wound,\r\nbecause they disable the young alligators before they are attacked by\r\nthem. All the inhabitants of the waters dread the society of the\r\ngymnoti. Lizards, tortoises, and frogs, seek pools where they are\r\nsecure from the electric action. It became necessary to change the\r\ndirection of a road near Uritucu, because the electric eels were so\r\nnumerous in one river, that they every year killed a great number of\r\nmules, as they forded the water with their burdens.\r\n\r\nThough in the present state of our knowledge we may flatter ourselves\r\nwith having thrown some light on the extraordinary effects of electric\r\nfishes, yet a vast number of physical and physiological researches\r\nstill remain to be made. The brilliant results which chemistry has\r\nobtained by means of the Voltaic battery, have occupied all observers,\r\nand turned attention for some time from the examinations of the\r\nphenomena of vitality. Let us hope that these phenomena, the most\r\nawful and the most mysterious of all, will in their turn occupy the\r\nearnest attention of natural philosophers. This hope will be easily\r\nrealized if they succeed in procuring anew living gymnoti in some one\r\nof the great capitals of Europe. The discoveries that will be made on\r\nthe electromotive apparatus of these fish, much more energetic, and\r\nmore easy of preservation, than the torpedos,* will extend to all the\r\nphenomena of muscular motion subject to volition. (* In order to\r\ninvestigate the phenomena of the living electromotive apparatus in its\r\ngreatest simplicity, and not to mistake for general conditions\r\ncircumstances which depend on the degree of energy of the electric\r\norgans, it is necessary to perform the experiments on those electrical\r\nfishes most easily tamed. If the gymnoti were not known, we might\r\nsuppose, from the observations made on torpedos, that fishes cannot\r\ngive their shocks from a distance through very thick strata of water,\r\nor through a bar of iron, without forming a circuit. Mr. Williamson\r\nhas felt strong shocks when he held only one hand in the water, and\r\nthis hand, without touching the gymnotus, was placed between it and\r\nthe small fish towards which the stroke was directed from ten or\r\nfifteen inches distance. Philosophical Transactions volume 65 pages 99\r\nand 108. When the gymnotus was enfeebled by bad health, the lateral\r\nshock was imperceptible; and in order to feel the shock, it was\r\nnecessary to form a chain, and touch the fish with both hands at once.\r\nCavendish, in his ingenious experiments on an artificial torpedo, had\r\nwell remarked these differences, depending on the greater or less\r\nenergy of the charge. Philosophical Transactions 1776 page 212.) It\r\nwill perhaps be found that, in most animals, every contraction of the\r\nmuscular fibre is preceded by a discharge from the nerve into the\r\nmuscle; and that the mere simple contact of heterogeneous substances\r\nis a source of movement and of life in all organized beings. Did an\r\ningenious and lively people, the Arabians, guess from remote\r\nantiquity, that the same force which inflames the vault of Heaven in\r\nstorms, is the living and invisible weapon of inhabitants of the\r\nwaters? It is said, that the electric fish of the Nile bears a name in\r\nEgypt, that signifies thunder.* (* It appears, however, that a\r\ndistinction is to be made between rahd, thunder, and rahadh, the\r\nelectrical fish; and that this latter word means simply that which\r\ncauses trembling.)\r\n\r\nWe left the town of Calabozo on the 24th of March, highly satisfied\r\nwith our stay, and the experiments we had made on an object so worthy\r\nof the attention of physiologists. I had besides obtained some good\r\nobservations of the stars; and discovered with surprise, that the\r\nerrors of maps amounted here also to a quarter of a degree of\r\nlatitude. No person had taken an observation before me on this spot;\r\nand geographers, magnifying as usual the distance from the coast to\r\nthe islands, have carried back beyond measure all the localities\r\ntowards the south.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced into the southern part of the Llanos, we found the\r\nground more dusty, more destitute of herbage, and more cracked by the\r\neffect of long drought. The palm-trees disappeared by degrees. The\r\nthermometer kept, from eleven in the morning till sunset, at 34 or 35\r\ndegrees. The calmer the air appeared at eight or ten feet high, the\r\nmore we were enveloped in those whirlwinds of dust, caused by the\r\nlittle currents of air that sweep the ground. About four o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, we found a young Indian girl stretched upon the\r\nsavannah. She was almost in a state of nudity, and appeared to be\r\nabout twelve or thirteen years of age. Exhausted with fatigue and\r\nthirst, her eyes, nostrils, and mouth filled with dust, she breathed\r\nwith a rattling in her throat, and was unable to answer our questions.\r\nA pitcher, overturned, and half filled with sand, was lying at her\r\nside. Happily one of our mules was laden with water; and we roused the\r\ngirl from her lethargic state by bathing her face, and forcing her to\r\ndrink a few drops of wine. She was at first alarmed on seeing herself\r\nsurrounded by so many persons; but by degrees she took courage, and\r\nconversed with our guides. She judged, from the position of the sun,\r\nthat she must have remained during several hours in that state of\r\nlethargy. We could not prevail on her to mount one of our beasts of\r\nburden, and she would not return to Uritucu. She had been in service\r\nat a neighbouring farm; and she had been discharged, because at the\r\nend of a long sickness she was less able to work than before. Our\r\nmenaces and prayers were alike fruitless; insensible to suffering,\r\nlike the rest of her race, she persisted in her resolution of going to\r\none of the Indian Missions near the city of Calabozo. We removed the\r\nsand from her pitcher, and filled it with water. She resumed her way\r\nalong the steppe, before we had remounted our horses, and was soon\r\nseparated from us by a cloud of dust. During the night we forded the\r\nRio Uritucu, which abounds with a breed of crocodiles remarkable for\r\ntheir ferocity. We were advised to prevent our dogs from going to\r\ndrink in the rivers, for it often happens that the crocodiles of\r\nUritucu come out of the water, and pursue dogs upon the shore. This\r\nintrepidity is so much the more striking, as at eight leagues\r\ndistance, the crocodiles of the Rio Tisnao are extremely timid, and\r\nlittle dangerous. The manners of animals vary in the same species\r\naccording to local circumstances difficult to be determined. We were\r\nshown a hut, or rather a kind of shed, in which our host of Calabozo,\r\nDon Miguel Cousin, had witnessed a very extraordinary scene. Sleeping\r\nwith one of his friends on a bench or couch covered with leather, Don\r\nMiguel was awakened early in the morning by a violent shaking and a\r\nhorrible noise. Clods of earth were thrown into the middle of the hut.\r\nPresently a young crocodile two or three feet long issued from under\r\nthe bed, darted at a dog which lay on the threshold of the door, and,\r\nmissing him in the impetuosity of his spring, ran towards the beach to\r\ngain the river. On examining the spot where the barbacoa, or couch,\r\nwas placed, the cause of this strange adventure was easily discovered.\r\nThe ground was disturbed to a considerable depth. It was dried mud,\r\nwhich had covered the crocodile in that state of lethargy, or\r\nsummer-sleep, in which many of the species lie during the absence of\r\nthe rains in the Llanos. The noise of men and horses, perhaps the\r\nsmell of the dog, had aroused the crocodile. The hut being built at\r\nthe edge of the pool, and inundated during part of the year, the\r\ncrocodile had no doubt entered, at the time of the inundation of the\r\nsavannahs, by the same opening at which it was seen to go out. The\r\nIndians often find enormous boas, which they call uji, or\r\nwater-serpents,* in the same lethargic state. (* Culebra de agua,\r\nnamed by the common people traga-venado, the swallower of stags. The\r\nword uji belongs to the Tamanac language.) To reanimate them, they\r\nmust be irritated, or wetted with water. Boas are killed, and immersed\r\nin the streams, to obtain, by means of putrefaction, the tendinous\r\nparts of the dorsal muscles, of which excellent guitar-strings are\r\nmade at Calabozo, preferable to those furnished by the intestines of\r\nthe alouate monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe drought and heat of the Llanos act like cold upon animals and\r\nplants. Beyond the tropics the trees lose their leaves in a very dry\r\nair. Reptiles, particularly crocodiles and boas, having very indolent\r\nhabits, leave with reluctance the basins in which they have found\r\nwater at the period of great inundations. In proportion as the pools\r\nbecome dry, these animals penetrate into the mud, to seek that degree\r\nof humidity which gives flexibility to their skin and integuments. In\r\nthis state of repose they are seized with stupefaction; but possibly\r\nthey preserve a communication with the external air; and, however\r\nlittle that communication may be, it possibly suffices to keep up the\r\nrespiration of an animal of the saurian family, provided with enormous\r\npulmonary sacs, exerting no muscular motion, and in which almost all\r\nthe vital functions are suspended. It is probable that the mean\r\ntemperature of the dried mud, exposed to the solar rays, is more than\r\n40 degrees. When the north of Egypt, where the coolest month does not\r\nfall below 13.4 degrees, was inhabited by crocodiles, they were often\r\nfound torpid with cold. They were subject to a winter-sleep, like the\r\nEuropean frog, lizard, sand-martin, and marmot. If the hibernal\r\nlethargy be observed, both in cold-blooded and in hot-blooded animals,\r\nwe shall be less surprised to learn, that these two classes furnish\r\nalike examples of a summer-sleep. In the same manner as the crocodiles\r\nof South America, the tanrecs, or Madagascar hedgehogs, in the midst\r\nof the torrid zone, pass three months of the year in lethargy.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of March we traversed the smoothest part of the steppes of\r\nCaracas, the Mesa de Pavones. It is entirely destitute of the corypha\r\nand moriche palm-trees. As far as the eye can reach, not a single\r\nobject fifteen inches high can be discovered. The air was clear, and\r\nthe sky of a very deep blue; but the horizon reflected a livid and\r\nyellowish light, caused no doubt by the quantity of sand suspended in\r\nthe atmosphere. We met some large herds of cattle, and with them\r\nflocks of birds of a black colour with an olive shade. They are of the\r\ngenus Crotophaga,* and follow the cattle. (* The Spanish colonists\r\ncall the Crotophaga ani, zamurito (little carrion vulture--Vultur aura\r\nminuta), or garapatero, the eater of garaparas, insects of the Acarus\r\nfamily.) We had often seen them perched on the backs of cows, seeking\r\nfor gadflies and other insects. Like many birds of these desert\r\nplaces, they fear so little the approach of man, that children often\r\ncatch them in their hands. In the valleys of Aragua, where they are\r\nvery common, we have seen them perch upon the hammocks on which we\r\nwere reposing, in open day.\r\n\r\nWe discover, between Calabozo, Uritucu, and the Mesa de Pavones,\r\nwherever there are excavations of some feet deep, the geological\r\nconstitution of the Llanos. A formation of red sandstone (ancient\r\nconglomerate) covers an extent of several thousand square leagues. We\r\nshall find it again in the vast plains of the Amazon, on the eastern\r\nboundary of the province of Jaen de Bracamoros. This prodigious\r\nextension of red sandstone in the low grounds stretching along the\r\neast of the Andes, is one of the most striking phenomena I observed\r\nduring my examination of rocks in the equinoctial regions.\r\n\r\nThe red sandstone of the Llanos of Caracas lies in a concave position,\r\nbetween the primitive mountains of the shore and of Parime. On the\r\nnorth it is backed by the transition-slates,* (* At Malpaso and\r\nPiedras Azules.) and on the south it rests immediately on the granites\r\nof the Orinoco. We observed in it rounded fragments of quartz\r\n(kieselschiefer), and Lydian stone, cemented by an olive-brown\r\nferruginous clay. The cement is sometimes of so bright a red that the\r\npeople of the country take it for cinnabar. We met a Capuchin monk at\r\nCalabozo, who was in vain attempting to extract mercury from this red\r\nsandstone. In the Mesa de Paja this rock contains strata of another\r\nquartzose sandstone, very fine-grained; more to the south it contains\r\nmasses of brown iron, and fragments of petrified trees of the\r\nmonocotyledonous family, but we did not see in it any shells. The red\r\nsandstone, called by the Llaneros, the stone of the reefs (piedra de\r\narrecifes), is everywhere covered with a stratum of clay. This clay,\r\ndried and hardened in the sun, splits into separate prismatic pieces\r\nwith five or six sides. Does it belong to the trap-formation of\r\nParapara? It becomes thicker, and mixed with sand, as we approach the\r\nRio Apure; for near Calabozo it is one toise thick, near the mission\r\nof Guayaval five toises, which may lead to the belief that the strata\r\nof red sandstone dips towards the south. We gathered in the Mesa de\r\nPavones little nodules of blue iron-ore disseminated in the clay.\r\n\r\nA dense whitish-gray limestone, with a smooth fracture, somewhat\r\nanalogous to that of Caripe, and consequently to that of Jura, lies on\r\nthe red sandstone between Tisnao and Calabozo.* (* Does this formation\r\nof secondary limestone of the Llanos contain galena? It has been found\r\nin strata of black marl, at Barbacoa, between Truxillo and\r\nBarquesimeto, north-west of the Llanos.) In several other places, for\r\ninstance in the Mesa de San Diego, and between Ortiz and the Mesa de\r\nPaja,* (* Also near Cachipe and San Joacquim, in the Llanos of\r\nBarcelona.) we find above the limestone lamellar gypsum alternating\r\nwith strata of marl. Considerable quantities of this gypsum are sent\r\nto the city of Caracas,* which is situated amidst primitive mountains.\r\n(* This trade is carried on at Parapara. A load of eight arrobas sells\r\nat Caracas for twenty-four piastres.)\r\n\r\nThis gypsum generally forms only small beds, and is mixed with a great\r\ndeal of fibrous gypsum. Is it of the same formation as that of Guire,\r\non the coast of Paria, which contains sulphur? or do the masses of\r\nthis latter substance, found in the valley of Buen Pastor and on the\r\nbanks of the Orinoco, belong, with the argillaceous gypsum of the\r\nLlanos, to a secondary formation much more recent.\r\n\r\nThese questions are very interesting in the study of the relative\r\nantiquity of rocks, which is the principal basis of geology. I know\r\nnot of any salt-deposits in the Llanos. Horned cattle prosper here\r\nwithout those famous bareros, or muriatiferous lands, which abound in\r\nthe Pampas of Buenos Ayres.* (* Known in North America under the name\r\nof salt-licks.)\r\n\r\nAfter having wandered for a long time, and without any traces of a\r\nroad, in the desert savannahs of the Mesa de Pavones, we were\r\nagreeably surprised when we came to a solitary farm, the Hato de Alta\r\nGracia, surrounded with gardens and basins of limpid water. Hedges of\r\nbead-trees encircled groups of icacoes laden with fruit. Farther on we\r\npassed the night near the small village of San Geronymo del Guayaval,\r\nfounded by Capuchin missionaries. It is situated near the banks of the\r\nRio Guarico, which falls into the Apure. I visited the missionary, who\r\nhad no other habitation than his church, not having yet built a house.\r\nHe was a young man, and he received us in the most obliging manner,\r\ngiving us all the information we desired. His village, or to use the\r\nword established among the monks, his Mission, was not easy to govern.\r\nThe founder, who had not hesitated to establish for his own profit a\r\npulperia, in other words, to sell bananas and guarapo in the church\r\nitself, had shown himself to be not very nice in the choice of the new\r\ncolonists. Many marauders of the Llanos had settled at Guayaval,\r\nbecause the inhabitants of a Mission are exempt from the authority of\r\nsecular law. Here, as in Australia, it cannot be expected that good\r\ncolonists will be formed before the second or third generation.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Guarico, and encamped in the savannahs south of\r\nGuayaval. Enormous bats, no doubt of the tribe of Phyllostomas,\r\nhovered as usual over our hammocks during a great part of the night.\r\nEvery moment they seemed to be about to fasten on our faces. Early in\r\nthe morning we pursued our way over low grounds, often inundated. In\r\nthe season of rains, a boat may be navigated, as on a lake, between\r\nthe Guarico and the Apure. We arrived on the 27th of March at the\r\nVilla de San Fernando, the capital of the Mission of the Capuchins in\r\nthe province of Varinas. This was the termination of our journey over\r\nthe Llanos; for we passed the three months of April, May, and June on\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.18.\r\n\r\nSAN FERNANDO DE APURE.\r\nINTERTWININGS AND BIFURCATIONS OF THE RIVERS APURE AND ARAUCA.\r\nNAVIGATION ON THE RIO APURE.\r\n\r\nTill the second half of the eighteenth century the names of the great\r\nrivers Apure, Arauca, and Meta were scarcely known in Europe:\r\ncertainly less than they had been in the two preceding centuries, when\r\nthe valiant Felipe de Urre and the conquerors of Tocuyo traversed the\r\nLlanos, to seek, beyond the Apure, the great legendary city of El\r\nDorado, and the rich country of the Omeguas, the Timbuctoo of the New\r\nContinent. Such daring expeditions could not be carried out without\r\nall the apparatus of war; and the weapons, which had been destined for\r\nthe defence of the new colonists, were employed without intermission\r\nagainst the unhappy natives. When more peaceful times succeeded to\r\nthose of violence and public calamity, two powerful Indian tribes, the\r\nCabres and the Caribs of the Orinoco, made themselves masters of the\r\ncountry which the Conquistadores had ceased to ravage. None but poor\r\nmonks were then permitted to advance to the south of the steppes.\r\nBeyond the Uritucu an unknown world opened to the Spanish colonists;\r\nand the descendants of those intrepid warriors who had extended their\r\nconquests from Peru to the coasts of New Grenada and the mouth of the\r\nAmazon, knew not the roads that lead from Coro to the Rio Meta. The\r\nshore of Venezuela remained a separate country; and the slow conquests\r\nof the Jesuit missionaries were successful only by skirting the banks\r\nof the Orinoco. These fathers had already penetrated beyond the great\r\ncataracts of Atures and Maypures, when the Andalusian Capuchins had\r\nscarcely reached the plains of Calabozo, from the coast and the\r\nvalleys of Aragua. It would be difficult to explain these contrasts by\r\nthe system according to which the different monastic orders are\r\ngoverned; for the aspect of the country contributes powerfully to the\r\nmore or less rapid progress of the Missions. They extend but slowly\r\ninto the interior of the land, over mountains, or in steppes, wherever\r\nthey do not follow the course of a particular river. It will scarcely\r\nbe believed, that the Villa de Fernando de Apure, only fifty leagues\r\ndistant in a direct line from that part of the coast of Caracas which\r\nhas been longest inhabited, was founded at no earlier a date than\r\n1789. We were shown a parchment, full of fine paintings, containing\r\nthe privileges of this little town. The parchment was sent from Madrid\r\nat the solicitation of the monks, whilst yet only a few huts of reeds\r\nwere to be seen around a great cross raised in the centre of the\r\nhamlet. The missionaries and the secular governments being alike\r\ninterested in exaggerating in Europe what they have done to augment\r\nthe culture and population of the provinces beyond the sea, it often\r\nhappens that names of towns and villages are placed on the list of new\r\nconquests, long before their foundation.\r\n\r\nThe situation of San Fernando, on a large navigable river, near the\r\nmouth of another river which traverses the whole province of Varinas,\r\nis extremely advantageous for trade. Every production of that\r\nprovince, hides, cacao, cotton, and the indigo of Mijagual, which is\r\nof the first quality, passes through this town towards the mouths of\r\nthe Orinoco. During the season of rains large vessels go from\r\nAngostura as far as San Fernando de Apure, and by the Rio Santo\r\nDomingo as far as Torunos, the port of the town of Varinas. At that\r\nperiod the inundations of the rivers, which form a labyrinth of\r\nbranches between the Apure, the Arauca, the Capanaparo, and the\r\nSinaruco, cover a country of nearly four hundred square leagues. At\r\nthis point, the Orinoco, turned aside from its course, not by\r\nneighbouring mountains, but by the rising of counterslopes, runs\r\neastward instead of following its previous direction in the line of\r\nthe meridian. Considering the surface of the globe as a polyhedron,\r\nformed of planes variously inclined, we may conceive by the mere\r\ninspection of the maps, that the intersection of these slopes, rising\r\ntowards the north, the west, and south,* between San Fernando de\r\nApure, Caycara, and the mouth of the Meta, must cause a considerable\r\ndepression. (* The risings towards the north and west are connected\r\nwith two lines of ridges, the mountains of Villa de Cura and of\r\nMerida. The third slope, running from north to south, is that of the\r\nland-strait between the Andes and the chain of Parime. It determines\r\nthe general inclination of the Orinoco, from the mouth of the Guaviare\r\nto that of the Apure.) The savannahs in this basin are covered with\r\ntwelve or fourteen feet of water, and present, at the period of rains,\r\nthe aspect of a great lake. The farms and villages which seem as if\r\nsituated on shoals, scarcely rise two or three feet above the surface\r\nof the water. Everything here calls to mind the inundations of Lower\r\nEgypt, and the lake of Xarayes, heretofore so celebrated among\r\ngeographers, though it exists only during some months of the year. The\r\nswellings of the rivers Apure, Meta, and Orinoco, are also periodical.\r\nIn the rainy season, the horses that wander in the savannah, and have\r\nnot time to reach the rising grounds of the Llanos, perish by\r\nhundreds. The mares are seen, followed by their colts,* swimming\r\nduring a part of the day to feed upon the grass, the tops of which\r\nalone wave above the waters. (The colts are drowned everywhere in\r\nlarge numbers, because they are sooner tired of swimming, and strive\r\nto follow the mares in places where the latter alone can touch the\r\nground.) In this state they are pursued by the crocodiles, and it is\r\nby no means uncommon to find the prints of the teeth of these\r\ncarnivorous reptiles on their thighs. The carcases of horses, mules,\r\nand cows, attract an innumerable quantity of vultures. The zamuros are\r\nthe ibisis of this country, and they render the same service to the\r\ninhabitants of the Llanos as the Vultur percnopterus to the\r\ninhabitants of Egypt.\r\n\r\nWe cannot reflect on the effects of these inundations without admiring\r\nthe prodigious pliability of the organization of the animals which man\r\nhas subjected to his sway. In Greenland the dog eats the refuse of the\r\nfisheries; and when fish are wanting, feeds on seaweed. The ass and\r\nthe horse, originally natives of the cold and barren plains of Upper\r\nAsia, follow man to the New World, return to the wild state, and lead\r\na restless and weary life in the burning climates of the tropics.\r\nPressed alternately by excess of drought and of humidity, they\r\nsometimes seek a pool in the midst of a bare and dusty plain, to\r\nquench their thirst; and at other times flee from water, and the\r\noverflowing rivers, as menaced by an enemy that threatens them on all\r\nsides. Tormented during the day by gadflies and mosquitos, the horses,\r\nmules, and cows find themselves attacked at night by enormous bats,\r\nwhich fasten on their backs, and cause wounds that become dangerous,\r\nbecause they are filled with acaridae and other hurtful insects. In\r\nthe time of great drought the mules gnaw even the thorny cactus* in\r\norder to imbibe its cooling juice, and draw it forth as from a\r\nvegetable fountain. (* The asses are particularly adroit in extracting\r\nthe moisture contained in the Cactus melocatus. They push aside the\r\nthorns with their hoofs; but sometimes lame themselves in performing\r\nthis feat.) During the great inundations these same animals lead an\r\namphibious life, surrounded by crocodiles, water-serpents, and\r\nmanatees. Yet, such are the immutable laws of nature, that their races\r\nare preserved in the struggle with the elements, and amid so many\r\nsufferings and dangers. When the waters retire, and the rivers return\r\nagain into their beds, the savannah is overspread with a beautiful\r\nscented grass; and the animals of Europe and Upper Asia seem to enjoy,\r\nas in their native climes, the renewed vegetation of spring.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of great floods, the inhabitants of these countries,\r\nto avoid the force of the currents, and the danger arising from the\r\ntrunks of trees which these currents bring down, instead of ascending\r\nthe beds of rivers in their boats, cross the savannahs. To go from San\r\nFernando to the villages of San Juan de Payara, San Raphael de\r\nAtamaica, or San Francisco de Capanaparo, they direct their course due\r\nsouth, as if they were crossing a single river of twenty leagues\r\nbroad. The junctions of the Guarico, the Apure, the Cabullare, and the\r\nArauca with the Orinoco, form, at a hundred and sixty leagues from the\r\ncoast of Guiana, a kind of interior Delta, of which hydrography\r\nfurnishes few examples in the Old World. According to the height of\r\nthe mercury in the barometer, the waters of the Apure have only a fall\r\nof thirty-four toises from San Fernando to the sea. The fall from the\r\nmouths of the Osage and the Missouri to the bar of the Mississippi is\r\nnot more considerable. The savannahs of Lower Louisiana everywhere\r\nremind us of the savannahs of the Lower Orinoco.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay of three days in the little town of San Fernando, we\r\nlodged with the Capuchin missionary, who lived much at his ease. We\r\nwere recommended to him by the bishop of Caracas, and he showed us the\r\nmost obliging attention. He consulted me on the works that had been\r\nundertaken to prevent the flood from undermining the shore on which\r\nthe town was built. The flowing of the Portuguesa into the Apure gives\r\nthe latter an impulse towards south-east; and, instead of procuring a\r\nfreer course for the river, attempts were made to confine it by dykes\r\nand piers. It was easy to predict that these would be rapidly\r\ndestroyed by the swell of the waters, the shore having been weakened\r\nby taking away the earth from behind the dyke to employ it in these\r\nhydraulic constructions.\r\n\r\nSan Fernando is celebrated for the excessive heat which prevails there\r\nthe greater part of the year; and before I begin the recital of our\r\nlong navigation on the rivers, I shall relate some facts calculated to\r\nthrow light on the meteorology of the tropics. We went, provided with\r\nthermometers, to the flat shores covered with white sand which border\r\nthe river Apure. At two in the afternoon I found the sand, wherever it\r\nwas exposed to the sun, at 52.5 degrees. The instrument, raised\r\neighteen inches above the sand, marked 42.8 degrees, and at six feet\r\nhigh 38.7 degrees. The temperature of the air under the shade of a\r\nceiba was 36.2 degrees. These observations were made during a dead\r\ncalm. As soon as the wind began to blow, the temperature of the air\r\nrose 3 degrees higher, yet we were not enveloped by a wind of sand,\r\nbut the strata of air had been in contact with a soil more strongly\r\nheated, or through which whirlwinds of sand had passed. This western\r\npart of the Llanos is the hottest, because it receives air that has\r\nalready crossed the rest of the barren steppe. The same difference has\r\nbeen observed between the eastern and western parts of the deserts of\r\nAfrica, where the trade-winds blow.\r\n\r\nThe heat augments sensibly in the Llanos during the rainy season,\r\nparticularly in the month of July, when the sky is cloudy, and\r\nreflects the radiant heat toward the earth. During this season the\r\nbreeze entirely ceases; and, according to good thermometrical\r\nobservations made by M. Pozo, the thermometer rises in the shade to 39\r\nand 39.5 degrees, though kept at the distance of more than fifteen\r\nfeet from the ground. As we approached the banks of the Portuguesa,\r\nthe Apure, and the Apurito, the air became cooler from the evaporation\r\nof so considerable a mass of water. This effect is more especially\r\nperceptible at sunset. During the day the shores of the rivers,\r\ncovered with white sand, reflect the heat in an insupportable degree,\r\neven more than the yellowish brown clayey grounds of Calabozo and\r\nTisnao.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of March I was on the shore at sunrise to measure the\r\nbreadth of the Apure, which is two hundred and six toises. The thunder\r\nrolled in all directions around. It was the first storm and the first\r\nrain of the season. The river was swelled by the easterly wind; but it\r\nsoon became calm, and then some great cetacea, much resembling the\r\nporpoises of our seas, began to play in long files on the surface of\r\nthe water. The slow and indolent crocodiles seem to dread the\r\nneighbourhood of these animals, so noisy and impetuous in their\r\nevolutions, for we saw them dive whenever they approached. It is a\r\nvery extraordinary phenomenon to find cetacea at such a distance from\r\nthe coast. The Spaniards of the Missions designate them, as they do\r\nthe porpoises of the ocean, by the name of toninas. The Tamanacs call\r\nthem orinucna. They are three or four feet long; and bending their\r\nback, and pressing with their tail on the inferior strata of the\r\nwater, they expose to view a part of the back and of the dorsal fin. I\r\ndid not succeed in obtaining any, though I often engaged Indians to\r\nshoot at them with their arrows. Father Gili asserts that the Gumanos\r\neat their flesh. Are these cetacea peculiar to the great rivers of\r\nSouth America, like the manatee, which, according to Cuvier, is also a\r\nfresh water cetaceous animal? or must we admit that they go up from\r\nthe sea against the current, as the beluga sometimes does in the\r\nrivers of Asia? What would lead me to doubt this last supposition is,\r\nthat we saw toninas above the great cataracts of the Orinoco, in the\r\nRio Atabapo. Did they penetrate into the centre of equinoctial America\r\nfrom the mouth of the Amazon, by the communication of that river with\r\nthe Rio Negro, the Cassiquiare, and the Orinoco? They are found here\r\nat all seasons, and nothing seems to denote that they make periodical\r\nmigrations like salmon.\r\n\r\nWhile the thunder rolled around us, the sky displayed only scattered\r\nclouds, that advanced slowly toward the zenith, and in an opposite\r\ndirection. The hygrometer of Deluc was at 53 degrees, the centigrade\r\nthermometer 23.7 degrees, and Saussure's hygrometer 87.5 degrees. The\r\nelectrometer gave no sign of electricity. As the storm gathered, the\r\nblue of the sky changed at first to deep azure and then to grey. The\r\nvesicular vapour became visible, and the thermometer rose three\r\ndegrees, as is almost always the case, within the tropics, from a\r\ncloudy sky which reflects the radiant heat of the soil. A heavy rain\r\nfell. Being sufficiently habituated to the climate not to fear the\r\neffect of tropical rains, we remained on the shore to observe the\r\nelectrometer. I held it more than twenty minutes in my hand, six feet\r\nabove the ground, and observed that in general the pith-balls\r\nseparated only a few seconds before the lightning was seen. The\r\nseparation was four lines. The electric charge remained the same\r\nduring several minutes; and having time to determine the nature of the\r\nelectricity, by approaching a stick of sealing-wax, I saw here what I\r\nhad often observed on the ridge of the Andes during a storm, that the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere was first positive, then nil, and then\r\nnegative. These oscillations from positive to negative were often\r\nrepeated. Yet the electrometer constantly denoted, a little before the\r\nlightning, only E., or positive E., and never negative E. Towards the\r\nend of the storm the west wind blew very strongly. The clouds\r\ndispersed, and the thermometer sunk to 22 degrees on account of the\r\nevaporation from the soil, and the freer radiation towards the sky.\r\n\r\nI have entered into these details on the electric charge of the\r\natmosphere because travellers in general confine themselves to the\r\ndescription of the impressions produced on a European newly arrived by\r\nthe solemn spectacle of a tropical storm. In a country where the year\r\nis divided into great seasons of drought and wet, or, as the Indians\r\nsay in their expressive language, of sun* (* In the Maypure dialect\r\ncamoti, properly the heat [of the sun]. The Tamanacs call the season\r\nof drought uamu, the time of grasshoppers.) and rain* (* In the\r\nTamanac language canepo. The year is designated, among several\r\nnations, by the name of one of the two seasons. The Maypures say, so\r\nmany suns, (or rather so many heats;) the Tamanacs, so many rains.),\r\nit is highly interesting to follow the progress of meteorological\r\nphenomena in the transition from one season to another. We had already\r\nobserved, in the valleys of Aragua from the 18th and 19th of February,\r\nclouds forming at the commencement of the night. In the beginning of\r\nthe month of March the accumulation of the vesicular vapours, visible\r\nto the eye, and with them signs of atmospheric electricity, augmented\r\ndaily. We saw flashes of heat-lightning to the south; and the\r\nelectrometer of Volta constantly displayed, at sunset, positive\r\nelectricity. The pith balls, unexcited during the day, separated to\r\nthe width of three or four lines at the commencement of the night,\r\nwhich is triple what I generally observed in Europe, with the same\r\ninstrument, in calm weather. Upon the whole, from the 26th of May, the\r\nelectrical equilibrium of the atmosphere seemed disturbed. During\r\nwhole hours the electricity was nil, then it became very strong, and\r\nsoon after was again imperceptible. The hygrometer of Deluc continued\r\nto indicate great dryness (from 33 to 35 degrees), and yet the\r\natmosphere appeared no longer the same. Amidst these perpetual\r\nvariations of the electric state of the air, the trees, divested of\r\ntheir foliage, already began to unfold new leaves, and seemed to feel\r\nthe approach of spring.\r\n\r\nThe variations which we have just described are not peculiar to one\r\nyear. Everything in the equinoctial zone has a wonderful uniformity of\r\nsuccession, because the active powers of nature limit and balance each\r\nother, according to laws that are easily recognized. I shall here note\r\nthe progress of atmospherical phenomena in the islands to the east of\r\nthe Cordilleras of Merida and of New Grenada, in the Llanos of\r\nVenezuela and the Rio Meta, from four to ten degrees of north\r\nlatitude, wherever the rains are constant from May to October, and\r\ncomprehending consequently the periods of the greatest heats, which\r\noccur in July and August.* (* The maximum of the heat is not felt on\r\nthe coast, at Cumana, at La Guayra, and in the neighbouring island of\r\nMargareta, before the month of September; and the rains, if the name\r\ncan be given to a few drops that fall at intervals, are observed only\r\nin the months of October and November.)\r\n\r\nNothing can equal the clearness of the atmosphere from the month of\r\nDecember to that of February. The sky is then constantly without\r\nclouds; and if one should appear, it is a phenomenon that engages the\r\nwhole attention of the inhabitants. A breeze from the east, and from\r\neast-north-east, blows with violence. As it brings with it air always\r\nof the same temperature, the vapours cannot become visible by cooling.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of February and the beginning of March, the blue of the\r\nsky is less intense, the hygrometer indicates by degrees greater\r\nhumidity, the stars are sometimes veiled by a slight stratum of\r\nvapour, and their light is no longer steady and planetary; they are\r\nseen twinkling from time to time when at 20 degrees above the horizon.\r\nThe breeze at this period becomes less strong, less regular, and is\r\noften interrupted by dead calms. The clouds accumulate towards\r\nsouth-south-east, appearing like distant mountains, with outlines\r\nstrongly marked. From time to time they detach themselves from the\r\nhorizon, and traverse the vault of the sky with a rapidity which\r\nlittle corresponds with the feeble wind prevailing in the lower strata\r\nof the air. At the end of March, the southern region of the atmosphere\r\nis illumined by small electric explosions. They are like\r\nphosphorescent gleams, circumscribed by vapour. The breeze then shifts\r\nfrom time to time, and for several hours together, to the west and\r\nsouth-west. This is a certain sign of the approach of the rainy\r\nseason, which begins at the Orinoco about the end of April. The blue\r\nsky disappears, and a grey tint spreads uniformly over it. At the same\r\ntime the heat of the atmosphere progressively increases; and soon the\r\nheavens are no longer obscured by clouds, but by condensed vapours.\r\nThe plaintive cry of the howling apes begins to be heard before\r\nsunrise. The atmospheric electricity, which, during the season of\r\ndrought, from December to March, had been constantly, in the day-time,\r\nfrom 1.7 to 2 lines, becomes extremely variable from the month of\r\nMarch. It appears nil during whole days; and then for some hours the\r\npith-balls diverge three or four lines. The atmosphere, which is\r\ngenerally, in the torrid as well as in the temperate zone, in a state\r\nof positive electricity, passes alternately, for eight or ten minutes,\r\nto the negative state. The season of rains is that of storms; and yet\r\na great number of experiments made during three years, prove to me\r\nthat it is precisely in this season of storms we find the smallest\r\ndegree of electric tension in the lower regions of the atmosphere. Are\r\nstorms the effect of this unequal charge of the different\r\nsuperincumbent strata of air? What prevents the electricity from\r\ndescending towards the earth, in air which becomes more humid after\r\nthe month of March? The electricity at this period, instead of being\r\ndiffused throughout the whole atmosphere, appears accumulated on the\r\nexterior envelope, at the surface of the clouds. According to M.\r\nGay-Lussac it is the formation of the cloud itself that carries the\r\nfluid toward its surface. The storm rises in the plains two hours\r\nafter the sun has passed the meridian; consequently a short time after\r\nthe moment of the maximum of diurnal heat within the tropics. It is\r\nextremely rare in the islands to hear thunder during the night, or in\r\nthe morning. Storms at night are peculiar to certain valleys of\r\nrivers, having a peculiar climate.\r\n\r\nWhat then are the causes of this rupture of the equilibrium in the\r\nelectric tension of the air? of this continual condensation of the\r\nvapours into water? of this interruption of the breezes? of this\r\ncommencement and duration of the rainy seasons? I doubt whether\r\nelectricity has any influence on the formation of vapours. It is\r\nrather the formation of these vapours that augments and modifies the\r\nelectrical tension. North and south of the equator, storms or great\r\nexplosions take place at the same time in the temperate and in the\r\nequinoctial zone. Is there an action propagated through the great\r\naerial ocean from the temperate zone towards the tropics? How can it\r\nbe conceived, that in that zone where the sun rises constantly to so\r\ngreat a height above the horizon, its passage through the zenith can\r\nhave so powerful an influence on the meteorological variations? I am\r\nof opinion that no local cause determines the commencement of the\r\nrains within the tropics; and that a more intimate knowledge of the\r\nhigher currents of air will elucidate these problems, so complicated\r\nin appearance. We can observe only what passes in the lower strata of\r\nthe atmosphere. The Andes are scarcely inhabited beyond the height of\r\ntwo thousand toises; and at that height the proximity of the soil, and\r\nthe masses of mountains, which form the shoals of the aerial ocean,\r\nhave a sensible influence on the ambient air. What we observe on the\r\ntable-land of Antisana is not what we should find at the same height\r\nin a balloon, hovering over the Llanos or the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that the season of rains and storms in the northern\r\nequinoctial zone coincides with the passage of the sun through the\r\nzenith of the place,* (* These passages take place, in the fifth and\r\ntenth degrees of north latitude between the 3rd and the 16th of April,\r\nand between the 27th of August and the 8th of September.) with the\r\ncessation of the north-east breezes, and with the frequency of calms\r\nand bendavales, which are stormy winds from south-east and south-west,\r\naccompanied by a cloudy sky. I believe that, in reflecting on the\r\ngeneral laws of the equilibrium of the gaseous masses constituting our\r\natmosphere, we may find, in the interruption of the current that blows\r\nfrom an homonymous pole, in the want of the renewal of air in the\r\ntorrid zone, and in the continued action of an ascending humid\r\ncurrent, a very simple cause of the coincidence of these phenomena.\r\nWhile the north-easterly breeze blows with all its violence north of\r\nthe equator, it prevents the atmosphere which covers the equinoctial\r\nlands and seas from saturating itself with moisture. The hot and moist\r\nair of the torrid zone rises aloft, and flows off again towards the\r\npoles; while inferior polar currents, bringing drier and colder\r\nstrata, are every instant taking the place of the columns of ascending\r\nair. By this constant action of two opposite currents, the humidity,\r\nfar from being accumulated in the equatorial region, is carried\r\ntowards the cold and temperate regions. During this season of breezes,\r\nwhich is that when the sun is in the southern signs, the sky in the\r\nnorthern equinoctial zone is constantly serene. The vesicular vapours\r\nare not condensed, because the air, unceasingly renewed, is far from\r\nthe point of saturation. In proportion as the sun, entering the\r\nnorthern signs, rises towards the zenith, the breeze from the\r\nnorth-east moderates, and by degrees entirely ceases. The difference\r\nof temperature between the tropics and the temperate northern zone is\r\nthen the least possible. It is the summer of the boreal pole; and, if\r\nthe mean temperature of the winter, between 42 and 52 degrees of north\r\nlatitude, be from 20 to 26 degrees of the centigrade thermometer less\r\nthan the equatorial heat, the difference in summer is scarcely from 4\r\nto 6 degrees. The sun being in the zenith, and the breeze having\r\nceased, the causes which produce humidity, and accumulate it in the\r\nnorthern equinoctial zone, become at once more active. The column of\r\nair reposing on this zone, is saturated with vapours, because it is no\r\nlonger renewed by the polar current. Clouds form in this air saturated\r\nand cooled by the combined effects of radiation and the dilatation of\r\nthe ascending air. This air augments its capacity for heat in\r\nproportion as it rarefies. With the formation and collection of the\r\nvesicular vapours, electricity accumulates in the higher regions of\r\nthe atmosphere. The precipitation of the vapours is continual during\r\nthe day; but it generally ceases at night, and frequently even before\r\nsunset. The showers are regularly more violent, and accompanied with\r\nelectric explosions, a short time after the maximum of the diurnal\r\nheat. This state of things remains unchanged, till the sun enters into\r\nthe southern signs. This is the commencement of cold in the northern\r\ntemperate zone. The current from the north-pole is then\r\nre-established, because the difference between the heat of the\r\nequinoctial and temperate regions augments daily. The north-east\r\nbreeze blows with violence, the air of the tropics is renewed, and can\r\nno longer attain the degree of saturation. The rains consequently\r\ncease, the vesicular vapour is dissolved, and the sky resumes its\r\nclearness and its azure tint. Electrical explosions are no longer\r\nheard, doubtless because electricity no longer comes in contact with\r\nthe groups of vesicular vapours in the high regions of the air, I had\r\nalmost said the coating of clouds, on which the fluid can accumulate.\r\n\r\nWe have here considered the cessation of the breezes as the principal\r\ncause of the equatorial rains. These rains in each hemisphere last\r\nonly as long as the sun has its declination in that hemisphere. It is\r\nnecessary to observe, that the absence of the breeze is not always\r\nsucceeded by a dead calm; but that the calm is often interrupted,\r\nparticularly along the western coast of America, by bendavales, or\r\nsouth-west and south-east winds. This phenomenon seems to demonstrate\r\nthat the columns of humid air which rise in the northern equatorial\r\nzone, sometimes flow off toward the south pole. In fact, the countries\r\nsituated in the torrid zone, both north and south of the equator,\r\nfurnish, during their summer, while the sun is passing through their\r\nzenith, the maximum of difference of temperature with the air of the\r\nopposite pole. The southern temperate zone has its winter, while it\r\nrains on the north of the equator; and while a mean heat prevails from\r\n5 to 6 degrees greater than in the time of drought, when the sun is\r\nlower.* (* From the equator to 10 degrees of north latitude the mean\r\ntemperatures of the summer and winter months scarcely differ 2 or 3\r\ndegrees; but at the limits of the torrid zone, toward the tropic of\r\nCancer, the difference amounts to 8 or 9 degrees.) The continuation of\r\nthe rains, while the bendavales blow, proves that the currents from\r\nthe remoter pole do not act in the northern equinoctial zone like the\r\ncurrents of the nearer pole, on account of the greater humidity of the\r\nsouthern polar current. The air, wafted by this current, comes from a\r\nhemisphere consisting almost entirely of water. It traverses all the\r\nsouthern equatorial zone to reach the parallel of 8 degrees north\r\nlatitude; and is consequently less dry, less cold, less adapted to act\r\nas a counter-current to renew the equinoctial air and prevent its\r\nsaturation, than the northern polar current, or the breeze from the\r\nnorth-east.* (* In the two temperate zones the air loses its\r\ntransparency every time that the wind blows from the opposite pole,\r\nthat is to say, from the pole that has not the same denomination as\r\nthe hemisphere in which the wind blows.) We may suppose that the\r\nbendavales are impetuous winds which, on some coasts, for instance on\r\nthat of Guatimala, (because they are not the effect of a regular and\r\nprogressive descent of the air of the tropics towards the south pole,\r\nbut they alternate with calms), are accompanied by electrical\r\nexplosions, and are in fact squalls, that indicate a reflux, an abrupt\r\nand instantaneous rupture, of equilibrium in the aerial ocean.\r\n\r\nWe have here discussed one of the most important phenomena of the\r\nmeteorology of the tropics, considered in its most general view. In\r\nthe same manner as the limits of the trade-winds do not form circles\r\nparallel with the equator, the action of the polar currents is\r\nvariously felt in different meridians. The chains of mountains and the\r\ncoasts in the same hemisphere have often opposite seasons. There are\r\nseveral examples of these anomalies; but, in order to discover the\r\nlaws of nature, we must know, before we examine into the causes of\r\nlocal perturbations, the average state of the atmosphere, and the\r\nconstant type of its variations.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the sky, the progress of the electricity, and the shower\r\nof the 28th of March, announced the commencement of the rainy season;\r\nwe were still advised, however, to go from San Fernando de Apure by\r\nSan Francisco de Capanaparo, the Rio Sinaruco, and the Hato de San\r\nAntonio, to the village of the Ottomacs, recently founded near the\r\nbanks of the Meta, and to embark on the Orinoco a little above\r\nCarichana. This way by land lies across an unhealthy and feverish\r\ncountry. An old farmer named Francisco Sanchez obligingly offered to\r\nconduct us. His dress denoted the great simplicity of manners\r\nprevailing in those distant countries. He had acquired a fortune of\r\nmore than 100,000 piastres, and yet he mounted on horseback with his\r\nfeet bare, and wearing large silver spurs. We knew by the experience\r\nof several weeks the dull uniformity of the vegetation of the Llanos,\r\nand preferred the longer road, which leads by the Rio Apure to the\r\nOrinoco. We chose one of those very large canoes called lanchas by the\r\nSpaniards. A pilot and four Indians were sufficient to manage it. They\r\nconstructed, near the stern, in the space of a few hours, a cabin\r\ncovered with palm-leaves, sufficiently spacious to contain a table and\r\nbenches. These were made of ox-hides, strained tight, and nailed to\r\nframes of brazil-wood. I mention these minute circumstances, to prove\r\nthat our accommodations on the Rio Apure were far different from those\r\nto which we were afterwards reduced in the narrow boats of the\r\nOrinoco. We loaded the canoe with provision for a month. Fowls, eggs,\r\nplantains, cassava, and cacao, are found in abundance at San Fernando.\r\nThe good Capuchin, Fray Jose Maria de Malaga, gave us sherry wine,\r\noranges, and tamarinds, to make cooling beverages. We could easily\r\nforesee that a roof constructed of palm-tree leaves would become\r\nexcessively hot on a large river, where we were almost always exposed\r\nto the perpendicular rays of the sun. The Indians relied less on the\r\nprovision we had purchased, than on their hooks and nets. We took also\r\nsome fire-arms, which we found in general use as far as the cataracts;\r\nbut farther south the great humidity of the air prevents the\r\nmissionaries from using them. The Rio Apure abounds in fish, manatees,\r\nand turtles, the eggs of which afford an aliment more nutritious than\r\nagreeable to the taste. Its banks are inhabited by an innumerable\r\nquantity of birds, among which the pauxi and the guacharaca, which may\r\nbe called the turkeys and pheasants of those countries, are found to\r\nbe the most useful. Their flesh appeared to be harder and less white\r\nthan that of the gallinaceous tribe in Europe, because they use much\r\nmore muscular exercise. We did not forget to add to our provision,\r\nfishing-tackle, fire-arms, and a few casks of brandy, to serve as a\r\nmedium of barter with the Indians of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nWe departed from San Fernando on the 30th of March, at four in the\r\nafternoon. The weather was extremely hot; the thermometer rising in\r\nthe shade to 34 degrees, though the breeze blew very strongly from the\r\nsouth-east. Owing to this contrary wind we could not set our sails. We\r\nwere accompanied, in the whole of this voyage on the Apure, the\r\nOrinoco, and the Rio Negro, by the brother-in-law of the governor of\r\nthe province of Varinas, Don Nicolas Soto, who had recently arrived\r\nfrom Cadiz. Desirous of visiting countries so calculated to excite the\r\ncuriosity of a European, he did not hesitate to confine himself with\r\nus during seventy-four days in a narrow boat infested with mosquitos.\r\nHis amiable disposition and gay temper often helped to make us forget\r\nthe sufferings of a voyage which was not wholly exempt from danger. We\r\npassed the mouth of the Apurito, and coasted the island of the same\r\nname, formed by the Apure and the Guarico. This island is in fact only\r\na very low spot of ground, bordered by two great rivers, both of\r\nwhich, at a little distance from each other, fall into the Orinoco,\r\nafter having formed a junction below San Fernando by the first\r\nbifurcation of the Apure. The Isla del Apurito is twenty-two leagues\r\nin length, and two or three leagues in breadth. It is divided by the\r\nCano de la Tigrera and the Cano del Manati into three parts, the two\r\nextremes of which bear the names of Isla de Blanco and Isla de los\r\nGarzitas. The right bank of the Apure, below the Apurito, is somewhat\r\nbetter cultivated than the left bank, where the Yaruros, or Japuin\r\nIndians, have constructed a few huts with reeds and stalks of\r\npalm-leaves. These people, who live by hunting and fishing, are very\r\nskilful in killing jaguars. It is they who principally carry the\r\nskins, known in Europe by the name of tiger-skins, to the Spanish\r\nvillages. Some of these Indians have been baptized, but they never\r\nvisit the Christian churches. They are considered as savages because\r\nthey choose to remain independent. Other tribes of Yaruros live under\r\nthe rule of the missionaries, in the village of Achaguas, situated\r\nsouth of the Rio Payara. The individuals of this nation, whom I had an\r\nopportunity of seeing at the Orinoco, have a stern expression of\r\ncountenance; and some features in their physiognomy, erroneously\r\ncalled Tartarian, belong to branches of the Mongol race, the eye very\r\nlong, the cheekbones high, but the nose prominent throughout its whole\r\nlength. They are taller, browner, and less thick-set than the Chayma\r\nIndians. The missionaries praise the intellectual character of the\r\nYaruros, who were formerly a powerful and numerous nation on the banks\r\nof the Orinoco, especially in the environs of Cuycara, below the mouth\r\nof the Guarico. We passed the night at Diamante, a small\r\nsugar-plantation formed opposite the island of the same name.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of my voyage from San Fernando to San Carlos del Rio\r\nNegro, and thence to the town of Angostura, I noted down day by day,\r\neither in the boat or where we disembarked at night, all that appeared\r\nto me worthy of observation. Violent rains, and the prodigious\r\nquantity of mosquitos with which the air is filled on the banks of the\r\nOrinoco and the Cassiquiare, necessarily occasioned some\r\ninterruptions; but I supplied the omission by notes taken a few days\r\nafter. I here subjoin some extracts from my journal. Whatever is\r\nwritten while the objects we describe are before our eyes bears a\r\ncharacter of truth and individuality which gives attraction to things\r\nthe least important.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st March a contrary wind obliged us to remain on shore till\r\nnoon. We saw a part of some cane-fields laid waste by the effect of a\r\nconflagration which had spread from a neighbouring forest. The\r\nwandering Indians everywhere set fire to the forest where they have\r\nencamped at night; and during the season of drought, vast provinces\r\nwould be the prey of these conflagrations if the extreme hardness of\r\nthe wood did not prevent the trees from being entirely consumed. We\r\nfound trunks of desmanthus and mahogany which were scarcely charred\r\ntwo inches deep.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the Diamante we entered a land inhabited only by tigers,\r\ncrocodiles, and chiguires; the latter are a large species of the genus\r\nCavia of Linnaeus. We saw flocks of birds, crowded so closely together\r\nas to appear against the sky like a dark cloud which every instant\r\nchanged its form. The river widens by degrees. One of its banks is\r\ngenerally barren and sandy from the effect of inundations; the other\r\nis higher, and covered with lofty trees. In some parts the river is\r\nbordered by forests on each side, and forms a straight canal a hundred\r\nand fifty toises broad. The manner in which the trees are disposed is\r\nvery remarkable. We first find bushes of sauso,* (* Hermesia\r\ncastaneifolia. This is a new genus, approaching the alchornea of\r\nSwartz.) forming a kind of hedge four feet high, and appearing as if\r\nthey had been clipped by the hand of man. A copse of cedar,\r\nbrazilletto, and lignum-vitae, rises behind this hedge. Palm-trees are\r\nrare; we saw only a few scattered trunks of the thorny piritu and\r\ncorozo. The large quadrupeds of those regions, the jaguars, tapirs,\r\nand peccaries, have made openings in the hedge of sauso which we have\r\njust described. Through these the wild animals pass when they come to\r\ndrink at the river. As they fear but little the approach of a boat, we\r\nhad the pleasure of viewing them as they paced slowly along the shore\r\ntill they disappeared in the forest, which they entered by one of the\r\nnarrow passes left at intervals between the bushes. These scenes,\r\nwhich were often repeated, had ever for me a peculiar attraction. The\r\npleasure they excite is not owing solely to the interest which the\r\nnaturalist takes in the objects of his study, it is connected with a\r\nfeeling common to all men who have been brought up in the habits of\r\ncivilization. You find yourself in a new world, in the midst of\r\nuntamed and savage nature. Now the jaguar--the beautiful panther of\r\nAmerica--appears upon the shore; and now the hocco,* (* Ceyx alector,\r\nthe peacock-pheasant; C. pauxi, the cashew-bird.) with its black\r\nplumage and tufted head, moves slowly along the sausos. Animals of the\r\nmost different classes succeed each other. \"Esse como en el Paradiso,\"\r\n\"It is just as it was in Paradise,\" said our pilot, an old Indian of\r\nthe Missions. Everything, indeed, in these regions recalls to mind the\r\nstate of the primitive world with its innocence and felicity. But in\r\ncarefully observing the manners of animals among themselves, we see\r\nthat they mutually avoid and fear each other. The golden age has\r\nceased; and in this Paradise of the American forests, as well as\r\neverywhere else, sad and long experience has taught all beings that\r\nbenignity is seldom found in alliance with strength.\r\n\r\nWhen the shore is of considerable breadth, the hedge of sauso remains\r\nat a distance from the river. In the intermediate space we see\r\ncrocodiles, sometimes to the number of eight or ten, stretched on the\r\nsand. Motionless, with their jaws wide open, they repose by each\r\nother, without displaying any of those marks of affection observed in\r\nother animals living in society. The troop separates as soon as they\r\nquit the shore. It is, however, probably composed of one male only,\r\nand many females; for as M. Descourtils, who has so much studied the\r\ncrocodiles of St. Domingo, observed to me, the males are rare, because\r\nthey kill one another in fighting during the season of their loves.\r\nThese monstrous creatures are so numerous, that throughout the whole\r\ncourse of the river we had almost at every instant five or six in\r\nview. Yet at this period the swelling of the Rio Apure was scarcely\r\nperceived; and consequently hundreds of crocodiles were still buried\r\nin the mud of the savannahs. About four in the afternoon we stopped to\r\nmeasure a dead crocodile which had been cast ashore. It was only\r\nsixteen feet eight inches long; some days after M. Bonpland found\r\nanother, a male, twenty-two feet three inches long. In every zone, in\r\nAmerica as in Egypt, this animal attains the same size. The species so\r\nabundant in the Apure, the Orinoco,* (* It is the arua of the Tamanac\r\nIndians, the amana of the Maypure Indians, the Crocodilus acutus of\r\nCuvier.) and the Rio de la Magdalena, is not a cayman, but a real\r\ncrocodile, analogous to that of the Nile, having feet dentated at the\r\nexternal edges. When it is recollected that the male enters the age of\r\npuberty only at ten years, and that its length is then eight feet, we\r\nmay presume that the crocodile measured by M. Bonpland was at least\r\ntwenty-eight years old. The Indians told us, that at San Fernando\r\nscarcely a year passes, without two or three grown-up persons,\r\nparticularly women who fetch water from the river, being drowned by\r\nthese carnivorous reptiles. They related to us the history of a young\r\ngirl of Uritucu, who by singular intrepidity and presence of mind,\r\nsaved herself from the jaws of a crocodile. When she felt herself\r\nseized, she sought the eyes of the animal, and plunged her fingers\r\ninto them with such violence, that the pain forced the crocodile to\r\nlet her go, after having bitten off the lower part of her left arm.\r\nThe girl, notwithstanding the enormous quantity of blood she lost,\r\nreached the shore, swimming with the hand that still remained to her.\r\nIn those desert countries, where man is ever wrestling with nature,\r\ndiscourse daily turns on the best means that may be employed to escape\r\nfrom a tiger, a boa, or a crocodile; every one prepares himself in\r\nsome sort for the dangers that may await him. \"I knew,\" said the young\r\ngirl of Uritucu coolly, \"that the cayman lets go his hold, if you push\r\nyour fingers into his eyes.\" Long after my return to Europe, I learned\r\nthat in the interior of Africa the negroes know and practise the same\r\nmeans of defence. Who does not recollect, with lively interest, Isaac,\r\nthe guide of the unfortunate Mungo Park, who was seized twice by a\r\ncrocodile, and twice escaped from the jaws of the monster, having\r\nsucceeded in thrusting his fingers into the creature's eyes while\r\nunder water. The African Isaac, and the young American girl, owed\r\ntheir safety to the same presence of mind, and the same combination of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the crocodile of the Apure are sudden and rapid when\r\nit attacks any object; but it moves with the slowness of a salamander,\r\nwhen not excited by rage or hunger. The animal in running makes a\r\nrustling noise, which seems to proceed from the rubbing of the scales\r\nof its skin one against another. In this movement it bends its back,\r\nand appears higher on its legs than when at rest. We often heard this\r\nrattling of the scales very near us on the shore; but it is not true,\r\nas the Indians pretend, that, like the armadillo, the old crocodiles\r\n\"can erect their scales, and every part of their armour.\" The motion\r\nof these animals is no doubt generally in a straight line, or rather\r\nlike that of an arrow, supposing it to change its direction at certain\r\ndistances. However, notwithstanding the little apparatus of false\r\nribs, which connects the vertebrae of the neck, and seems to impede\r\nthe lateral movement, crocodiles can turn easily when they please. I\r\noften saw young ones biting their tails; and other observers have seen\r\nthe same action in crocodiles at their full growth. If their movements\r\nalmost always appear to be straight forward, it is because, like our\r\nsmall lizards, they move by starts. Crocodiles are excellent swimmers;\r\nthey go with facility against the most rapid current. It appeared to\r\nme, however, that in descending the river, they had some difficulty in\r\nturning quickly about. A large dog, which had accompanied us in our\r\njourney from Caracas to the Rio Negro, was one day pursued in swimming\r\nby an enormous crocodile. The latter had nearly reached its prey, when\r\nthe dog escaped by turning round suddenly and swimming against the\r\ncurrent. The crocodile performed the same movement, but much more\r\nslowly than the dog, which succeeded in gaining the shore.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles of the Apure find abundant food in the chiguires\r\n(thick-nosed tapirs),* which live fifty or sixty together in troops on\r\nthe banks of the river. (* Cavia capybara, Linn. The word chiguire\r\nbelongs to the language of the Palenkas and the Cumanagotos. The\r\nSpaniards call this animal guardatinaja; the Caribs, capigua; the\r\nTamanacs, cappiva; and the Maypures, chiato. According to Azara, it is\r\nknown at Buenos Ayres by the Indian names of capiygua and capiguara.\r\nThese various denominations show a striking analogy between the\r\nlanguages of the Orinoco and those of the Rio de la Plata.) These\r\nanimals, as large as our pigs, have no weapons of defence; they swim\r\nsomewhat better than they run: yet they become the prey of the\r\ncrocodiles in the water, and of the tigers on land. It is difficult to\r\nconceive, how, being thus persecuted by two powerful enemies, they\r\nbecome so numerous; but they breed with the same rapidity as the\r\nlittle cavies or guinea-pigs, which come to us from Brazil.\r\n\r\nWe stopped below the mouth of the Cano de la Tigrera, in a sinuosity\r\ncalled la Vuelta del Joval, to measure the velocity of the water at\r\nits surface. It was not more than 3.2 feet* in a second, which gives\r\n2.56 feet for the mean velocity. (* In order to measure the velocity\r\nof the surface of a river, I generally measured on the beach a base of\r\n250 feet, and observed with the chronometer the time that a floating\r\nbody, abandoned to the current, required to reach this distance.) The\r\nheight of the barometer indicated barely a slope of seventeen inches\r\nin a mile of nine hundred and fifty toises. The velocity is the\r\nsimultaneous effect of the slope of the ground, and the accumulation\r\nof the waters by the swelling of the upper parts of the river. We were\r\nagain surrounded by chiguires, which swim like dogs, raising their\r\nheads and necks above the water. We saw with surprise a large\r\ncrocodile on the opposite shore, motionless, and sleeping in the midst\r\nof these nibbling animals. It awoke at the approach of our canoe, and\r\nwent into the water slowly, without frightening the chiguires. Our\r\nIndians accounted for this indifference by the stupidity of the\r\nanimals, but it is more probable that the chiguires know by long\r\nexperience, that the crocodile of the Apure and the Orinoco does not\r\nattack upon land, unless he finds the object he would seize\r\nimmediately in his way, at the instant when he throws himself into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nNear the Joval nature assumes an awful and extremely wild aspect. We\r\nthere saw the largest jaguar we had ever met with. The natives\r\nthemselves were astonished at its prodigious length, which surpassed\r\nthat of any Bengal tiger I had ever seen in the museums of Europe. The\r\nanimal lay stretched beneath the shade of a large zamang.* (* A\r\nspecies of mimosa.) It had just killed a chiguire, but had not yet\r\ntouched its prey, on which it kept one of its paws. The zamuro\r\nvultures were assembled in great numbers to devour the remains of the\r\njaguar's repast. They presented the most curious spectacle, by a\r\nsingular mixture of boldness and timidity. They advanced within the\r\ndistance of two feet from the animal, but at the least movement he\r\nmade they drew back. In order to observe more nearly the manners of\r\nthese creatures, we went into the little skiff that accompanied our\r\ncanoe. Tigers very rarely attack boats by swimming to them; and never\r\nbut when their ferocity is heightened by a long privation of food. The\r\nnoise of our oars led the animal to rise slowly, and hide itself\r\nbehind the sauso bushes that bordered the shore. The vultures tried to\r\nprofit by this moment of absence to devour the chiguire; but the\r\ntiger, notwithstanding the proximity of our boat, leaped into the\r\nmidst of them, and in a fit of rage, expressed by his gait and the\r\nmovement of his tail, carried off his prey to the forest. The Indians\r\nregretted that they were not provided with their lances, in order to\r\ngo on shore and attack the tiger. They are accustomed to this weapon,\r\nand were right in not trusting to our fire-arms. In so excessively\r\ndamp an atmosphere muskets often miss fire.\r\n\r\nContinuing to descend the river, we met with the great herd of\r\nchiguires which the tiger had put to flight, and from which he had\r\nselected his prey. These animals saw us land very unconcernedly; some\r\nof them were seated, and gazed upon us, moving the upper lip like\r\nrabbits. They seemed not to be afraid of man, but the sight of our dog\r\nput them to flight. Their hind legs being longer than their fore legs,\r\ntheir pace is a slight gallop, but with so little swiftness that we\r\nsucceeded in catching two of them. The chiguire, which swims with the\r\ngreatest agility, utters a short moan in running, as if its\r\nrespiration were impeded. It is the largest of the family of rodentia\r\nor gnawing animals. It defends itself only at the last extremity, when\r\nit is surrounded and wounded. Having great strength in its grinding\r\nteeth,* particularly the hinder ones, which are pretty long, it can\r\ntear the paw of a tiger, or the leg of a horse, with its bite. (* We\r\ncounted eighteen on each side. On the hind feet, at the upper end of\r\nthe metatarsus, there is a callosity three inches long and three\r\nquarters of an inch broad, destitute of hair. The animal, when seated,\r\nrests upon this part. No tail is visible externally; but on putting\r\naside the hair we discover a tubercle, a mass of naked and wrinkled\r\nflesh, of a conical figure, and half an inch long.) Its flesh has a\r\nmusky smell somewhat disagreeable; yet hams are made of it in this\r\ncountry, a circumstance which almost justifies the name of water-hog,\r\ngiven to the chiguire by some of the older naturalists. The missionary\r\nmonks do not hesitate to eat these hams during Lent. According to\r\ntheir zoological classification they place the armadillo, the\r\nthick-nosed tapir, and the manatee, near the tortoises; the first,\r\nbecause it is covered with a hard armour like a sort of shell; and the\r\nothers because they are amphibious. The chiguires are found in such\r\nnumbers on the banks of the rivers Santo Domingo, Apure, and Arauca,\r\nin the marshes and in the inundated savannahs* of the Llanos, that the\r\npasturages suffer from them. (* Near Uritucu, in the Cano del Ravanal,\r\nwe saw a flock of eighty or one hundred of these animals.) They browze\r\nthe grass which fattens the horses best, and which bears the name of\r\nchiguirero, or chiguire-grass. They feed also upon fish; and we saw\r\nwith surprise, that, when scared by the approach of a boat, the animal\r\nin diving remains eight or ten minutes under water.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night as usual, in the open air, though in a plantation,\r\nthe proprietor of which employed himself in hunting tigers. He wore\r\nscarcely any clothing, and was of a dark brown complexion like a\r\nZambo. This did not prevent his classing himself amongst the Whites.\r\nHe called his wife and his daughter, who were as naked as himself,\r\nDona Isabella and Dona Manuela. Without having ever quitted the banks\r\nof the Apure, he took a lively interest in the news of\r\nMadrid--enquiring eagerly respecting those never-ending wars, and\r\neverything down yonder (todas las cosas de alla). He knew, he said,\r\nthat the king was soon to come and visit the grandees of the country\r\nof Caracas, but he added with some pleasantry, as the people of the\r\ncourt can eat only wheaten bread, they will never pass beyond the town\r\nof Victoria, and we shall not see them here. I had brought with me a\r\nchiguire, which I had intended to have roasted; but our host assured\r\nus, that such Indian game was not food fit for nos otros caballeros\r\nblancos, (white gentlemen like ourselves and him). Accordingly he\r\noffered us some venison, which he had killed the day before with an\r\narrow, for he had neither powder nor fire-arms.\r\n\r\nWe supposed that a small wood of plantain-trees concealed from us the\r\nhut of the farm; but this man, so proud of his nobility and the colour\r\nof his skin, had not taken the trouble of constructing even an ajoupa,\r\nor hut of palm-leaves. He invited us to have our hammocks hung near\r\nhis own, between two trees; and he assured us, with an air of\r\ncomplacency, that, if we came up the river in the rainy season, we\r\nshould find him beneath a roof (baxo techo). We soon had reason to\r\ncomplain of a system of philosophy which is indulgent to indolence,\r\nand renders a man indifferent to the conveniences of life. A furious\r\nwind arose after midnight, lightnings flashed over the horizon,\r\nthunder rolled, and we were wet to the skin. During this storm a\r\nwhimsical incident served to amuse us for a moment. Dona Isabella's\r\ncat had perched upon the tamarind-tree, at the foot of which we lay.\r\nIt fell into the hammock of one of our companions, who, being hurt by\r\nthe claws of the cat, and suddenly aroused from a profound sleep,\r\nimagined he was attacked by some wild beast of the forest. We ran to\r\nhim on hearing his cries, and had some trouble to convince him of his\r\nerror. While it rained in torrents on our hammocks and on our\r\ninstruments which we had brought ashore, Don Ignacio congratulated us\r\non our good fortune in not sleeping on the strand, but finding\r\nourselves in his domain, among whites and persons of respectability\r\n(entre gente blanca y de trato). Wet as we were, we could not easily\r\npersuade ourselves of the advantages of our situation, and we listened\r\nwith some impatience to the long narrative our host gave us of his\r\npretended expedition to the Rio Meta, of the valour he had displayed\r\nin a sanguinary combat with the Guahibo Indians, and \"the services\r\nthat he had rendered to God and his king, in carrying away Indian\r\nchildren (los Indiecitos) from their parents, to distribute them in\r\nthe Missions.\" We were struck with the singularity of finding in that\r\nvast solitude a man believing himself to be of European race and\r\nknowing no other shelter than the shade of a tree, and yet having all\r\nthe vain pretensions, hereditary prejudices, and errors of\r\nlong-standing civilization!\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of April, at sunrise, we quitted Senor Don Ignacio and\r\nSenora Dona Isabella his wife. The weather was cooler, for the\r\nthermometer (which generally kept up in the daytime to 30 or 35\r\ndegrees) had sunk to 24 degrees. The temperature of the river was\r\nlittle changed: it continued constantly at 26 or 27 degrees. The\r\ncurrent carried with it an enormous number of trunks of trees. It\r\nmight be imagined that on ground entirely smooth, and where the eye\r\ncannot distinguish the least hill, the river would have formed by the\r\nforce of its current a channel in a straight line; but a glance at the\r\nmap, which I traced by the compass, will prove the contrary. The two\r\nbanks, worn by the waters, do not furnish an equal resistance; and\r\nalmost imperceptible inequalities of the level suffice to produce\r\ngreat sinuosities. Yet below the Joval, where the bed of the river\r\nenlarges a little, it forms a channel that appears perfectly straight,\r\nand is shaded on each side by very tall trees. This part of the river\r\nis called Cano Rico. I found it to be one hundred and thirty-six\r\ntoises broad. We passed a low island, inhabited by thousands of\r\nflamingos, rose-coloured spoonbills, herons, and moorhens, which\r\ndisplayed plumage of the most various colours. These birds were so\r\nclose together that they seemed to be unable to stir. The island they\r\nfrequent is called Isla de Aves, or Bird Island. Lower down we passed\r\nthe point where the Rio Arichuna, an arm of the Apure, branches off to\r\nthe Cabulare, carrying away a considerable body of its waters. We\r\nstopped, on the right bank, at a little Indian mission, inhabited by\r\nthe tribe of the Guamos, called the village of Santa Barbara de\r\nArichuna.\r\n\r\nThe Guamos* are a race of Indians very difficult to fix on a settled\r\nspot. (* Father Gili observes that their Indian name is Uamu and Pau,\r\nand that they originally dwelt on the Upper Apure.) They have great\r\nsimilarity of manners with the Achaguas, the Guajibos,* (* Their\r\nIndian name is Guahiva.) and the Ottomacs, partaking their disregard\r\nof cleanliness, their spirit of vengeance, and their taste for\r\nwandering; but their language differs essentially. The greater part of\r\nthese four tribes live by fishing and hunting, in plains often\r\ninundated, situated between the Apure, the Meta, and the Guaviare. The\r\nnature of these regions seems to invite the natives to a wandering\r\nlife. On entering the mountains of the Cataracts of the Orinoco, we\r\nshall soon find, among the Piraoas, the Macos, and the Maquiritaras,\r\nmilder manners, a love of agriculture, and great cleanliness in the\r\ninterior of their huts. On mountain ridges, in the midst of\r\nimpenetrable forests, man is compelled to fix himself; and cultivate a\r\nsmall spot of land. This cultivation requires little care; while, in a\r\ncountry where there are no other roads than rivers, the life of the\r\nhunter is laborious and difficult. The Guamos of the mission of Santa\r\nBarbara could not furnish us with the provision we wanted. They\r\ncultivate only a little cassava. They appeared hospitable; and when we\r\nentered their huts, they offered us dried fish, and water cooled in\r\nporous vessels.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Vuelta del Cochino Roto, in a spot where the river has\r\nscooped itself a new bed, we passed the night on a bare and very\r\nextensive strand. The forest being impenetrable, we had the greatest\r\ndifficulty to find dry wood to light fires, near which the Indians\r\nbelieve themselves in safety from the nocturnal attacks of the tiger.\r\nOur own experience seems to bear testimony in favour of this opinion;\r\nbut Azara asserts that, in his time, a tiger in Paraguay carried off a\r\nman who was seated near a fire lighted in the savannah.\r\n\r\nThe night was calm and serene, and there was a beautiful moonlight.\r\nThe crocodiles, stretched along the shore, placed themselves in such a\r\nmanner as to be able to see the fire. We thought we observed that its\r\nblaze attracted them, as it attracts fishes, crayfish, and other\r\ninhabitants of the water. The Indians showed us the tracks of three\r\ntigers in the sand, two of which were very young. A female had no\r\ndoubt conducted her little ones to drink at the river. Finding no tree\r\non the strand, we stuck our oars in the ground, and to these we\r\nfastened our hammocks. Everything passed tranquilly till eleven at\r\nnight; and then a noise so terrific arose in the neighbouring forest,\r\nthat it was almost impossible to close our eyes. Amid the cries of so\r\nmany wild beasts howling at once, the Indians discriminated such only\r\nas were at intervals heard separately. These were the little soft\r\ncries of the sapajous, the moans of the alouate apes, the howlings of\r\nthe jaguar and couguar, the peccary, and the sloth, and the cries of\r\nthe curassao, the parraka, and other gallinaceous birds. When the\r\njaguars approached the skirt of the forest, our dog, which till then\r\nhad never ceased barking, began to howl and seek for shelter beneath\r\nour hammocks. Sometimes, after a long silence, the cry of the tiger\r\ncame from the tops of the trees; and then it was followed by the sharp\r\nand long whistling of the monkeys, which appeared to flee from the\r\ndanger that threatened them. We heard the same noises repeated, during\r\nthe course of whole months, whenever the forest approached the bed of\r\nthe river. The security evinced by the Indians inspires confidence in\r\nthe minds of travellers, who readily persuade themselves that the\r\ntigers are afraid of fire, and that they do not attack a man lying in\r\nhis hammock. These attacks are in fact extremely rare; and, during a\r\nlong abode in South America, I remember only one example, of a\r\nllanero, who was found mutilated in his hammock opposite the island of\r\nAchaguas.\r\n\r\nWhen the natives are interrogated on the causes of the tremendous\r\nnoise made by the beasts of the forest at certain hours of the night,\r\nthe answer is, \"They are keeping the feast of the full moon.\"\r\n\r\nI believe this agitation is most frequently the effect of some\r\nconflict that has arisen in the depths of the forest. The jaguars, for\r\ninstance, pursue the peccaries and the tapirs, which, having no\r\ndefence but in their numbers, flee in close troops, and break down the\r\nbushes they find in their way. Terrified at this struggle, the timid\r\nand mistrustful monkeys answer, from the tops of the trees, the cries\r\nof the large animals. They awaken the birds that live in society, and\r\nby degrees the whole assembly is in commotion. It is not always in a\r\nfine moonlight, but more particularly at the time of a storm and\r\nviolent showers, that this tumult takes place among the wild beasts.\r\n\"May Heaven grant them a quiet night and repose, and us also!\" said\r\nthe monk who accompanied us to the Rio Negro, when, sinking with\r\nfatigue, he assisted in arranging our accommodations for the night. It\r\nwas indeed strange, to find no silence in the solitude of woods. In\r\nthe inns of Spain we dread the sound of guitars from the next\r\napartment; on the Orinoco, where the traveller's resting-place is the\r\nopen beach, or beneath the shelter of a solitary tree, his slumbers\r\nare disturbed by a serenade from the forest.\r\n\r\nWe set sail before sunrise, on the 2nd of April. The morning was\r\nbeautiful and cool, according to the feelings of those who are\r\naccustomed to the heat of these climates. The thermometer rose only to\r\n28 degrees in the air, but the dry and white sand of the beach,\r\nnotwithstanding its radiation towards a cloudless sky, retained a\r\ntemperature of 36 degrees. The porpoises (toninas) ploughed the river\r\nin long files. The shore was covered with fishing-birds. Some of these\r\nperched on the floating wood as it passed down the river, and\r\nsurprised the fish that preferred the middle of the stream. Our canoe\r\nwas aground several times during the morning. These shocks are\r\nsufficiently violent to split a light bark. We struck on the points of\r\nseveral large trees, which remain for years in an oblique position,\r\nsunk in the mud. These trees descend from Sarare, at the period of\r\ngreat inundations, and they so fill the bed of the river, that canoes\r\nin going up find it difficult sometimes to make their way over the\r\nshoals, or wherever there are eddies. We reached a spot near the\r\nisland of Carizales, where we saw trunks of the locust-tree, of an\r\nenormous size, above the surface of the water. They were covered with\r\na species of plotus, nearly resembling the anhinga, or white bellied\r\ndarter. These birds perch in files, like pheasants and parrakas, and\r\nthey remain for hours entirely motionless, with their beaks raised\r\ntoward the sky.\r\n\r\nBelow the island of Carizales we observed a diminution of the waters\r\nof the river, at which we were the more surprised, as, after the\r\nbifurcation at la Boca de Arichuna, there is no branch, no natural\r\ndrain, which takes away water from the Apure. The loss is solely the\r\neffect of evaporation, and of filtration on a sandy and wet shore.\r\nSome idea of the magnitude of these effects may be formed, from the\r\nfact that we found the heat of the dry sands, at different hours of\r\nthe day, from 36 to 52 degrees, and that of sands covered with three\r\nor four inches of water 32 degrees. The beds of rivers are heated as\r\nfar as the depth to which the solar rays can penetrate without\r\nundergoing too great an extinction in their passage through the\r\nsuperincumbent strata of water. Besides, filtration extends in a\r\nlateral direction far beyond the bed of the river. The shore, which\r\nappears dry to us, imbibes water as far up as to the level of the\r\nsurface of the river. We saw water gush out at the distance of fifty\r\ntoises from the shore, every time that the Indians struck their oars\r\ninto the ground. Now these sands, wet below, but dry above, and\r\nexposed to the solar rays, act like sponges, and lose the infiltrated\r\nwater every instant by evaporation. The vapour that is emitted,\r\ntraverses the upper stratum of sand strongly heated, and becomes\r\nsensible to the eye when the air cools towards evening. As the beach\r\ndries, it draws from the river new portions of water; and it may be\r\neasily conceived that this continual alternation of vaporization and\r\nlateral absorption must cause an immense loss, difficult to submit to\r\nexact calculation. The increase of these losses would be in proportion\r\nto the length of the course of the rivers, if from their source to\r\ntheir mouth they were equally surrounded by a flat shore; but these\r\nshores being formed by deposits from the water, and the water having\r\nless velocity in proportion as it is more remote from its source,\r\nthrowing down more sediment in the lower than in the upper part of its\r\ncourse, many rivers in hot climates undergo a diminution in the\r\nquantity of their water, as they approach their outlets. Mr. Barrow\r\nobserved these curious effects of sands in the southern part of\r\nAfrica, on the banks of the Orange River. They have also become the\r\nsubject of a very important discussion, in the various hypotheses that\r\nhave been formed respecting the course of the Niger.* (* Geographers\r\nsupposed, for a long period, that the Niger was entirely absorbed by\r\nthe sands, and evaporated by the heat of the tropical sun, as no\r\nembouchure could be found on the western coast of Africa to meet the\r\nrequirements of so enormous a river. It was discovered, however, by\r\nthe Landers, in 1830, that it does really flow into the Atlantic; yet\r\nthe cause mentioned above is so powerful, that of all the numerous\r\nbranches into which it separates at its mouth, only one (the Nun\r\nRiver) is navigable even for light ships, and for half the year even\r\nthose are unable to enter.)\r\n\r\nNear the Vuelta de Basilio, where we landed to collect plants, we saw\r\non the top of a tree two beautiful little monkeys, black as jet, of\r\nthe size of the sai, with prehensile tails. Their physiognomy and\r\ntheir movements sufficiently showed that they were neither the quato\r\n(Simia beelzebub) nor the chamek, nor any of the Ateles. Our Indians\r\nthemselves had never seen any that resembled them. Monkeys, especially\r\nthose living in troops, make long emigrations at certain periods, and\r\nconsequently it happens that at the beginning of the rainy seasons the\r\nnatives discover round their huts different kinds which they have not\r\nbefore observed. On this same bank our guides showed us a nest of\r\nyoung iguanas only four inches long. It was difficult to distinguish\r\nthem from common lizards. There was no distinguishing mark yet formed\r\nbut the dewlap below the throat. The dorsal spines, the large erect\r\nscales, all those appendages that render the iguana so remarkable when\r\nit attains its full growth, were scarcely traceable.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this animal of the saurian family appeared to us to have\r\nan agreeable taste in every country where the climate is very dry; we\r\neven found it so at periods when we were not in want of other food. It\r\nis extremely white, and next to the flesh of the armadillo, one of the\r\nbest kinds of food to be found in the huts of the natives.\r\n\r\nIt rained toward evening, and before the rain fell, swallows, exactly\r\nresembling our own, skimmed over the surface of the water. We saw also\r\na flock of paroquets pursued by little goshawks without crests. The\r\npiercing cries of these paroquets contrasted singularly with the\r\nwhistling of the birds of prey. We passed the night in the open air,\r\nupon the beach, near the island of Carizales. There were several\r\nIndian huts in the neighbourhood, surrounded with plantations. Our\r\npilot assured us beforehand that we should not hear the cries of the\r\njaguar, which, when not extremely pressed by hunger, withdraws from\r\nplaces where he does not reign unmolested. \"Men put him out of humour\"\r\n(los hombres lo enfadan), say the people in the Missions. A pleasant\r\nand simple expression, that marks a well-observed fact.\r\n\r\nSince our departure from San Fernando we had not met a single boat on\r\nthis fine river. Everything denoted the most profound solitude. On the\r\nmorning of the 3rd of April our Indians caught with a hook the fish\r\nknown in the country by the name of caribe,* (* Caribe in the Spanish\r\nlanguage signifies cannibal.) or caribito, because no other fish has\r\nsuch a thirst for blood. It attacks bathers and swimmers, from whom it\r\noften bites away considerable pieces of flesh. The Indians dread\r\nextremely these caribes; and several of them showed us the scars of\r\ndeep wounds in the calf of the leg and in the thigh, made by these\r\nlittle animals. They swim at the bottom of rivers; but if a few drops\r\nof blood be shed on the water, they rise by thousands to the surface,\r\nso that if a person be only slightly bitten, it is difficult for him\r\nto get out of the water without receiving a severer wound. When we\r\nreflect on the numbers of these fish, the largest and most voracious\r\nof which are only four or five inches long, on the triangular form of\r\ntheir sharp and cutting teeth, and on the amplitude of their\r\nretractile mouths, we need not be surprised at the fear which the\r\ncaribe excites in the inhabitants of the banks of the Apure and the\r\nOrinoco. In places where the river was very limpid, where not a fish\r\nappeared, we threw into the water little morsels of raw flesh, and in\r\na few minutes a perfect cloud of caribes had come to dispute their\r\nprey. The belly of this fish has a cutting edge, indented like a saw,\r\na characteristic which may be also traced in the serra-salmes, the\r\nmyletes, and the pristigastres. The presence of a second adipous\r\ndorsal fin, and the form of the teeth, covered by lips distant from\r\neach other, and largest in the lower jaw, place the caribe among the\r\nserra-salmes. Its mouth is much wider than that of the myletes of\r\nCuvier. Its body, toward the back, is ash-coloured with a tint of\r\ngreen, but the belly, the gill-covers, and the pectoral, anal, and\r\nventral fins, are of a fine orange hue. Three species are known in the\r\nOrinoco, and are distinguished by their size. The intermediate appears\r\nto be identical with the medium species of the piraya, or piranha, of\r\nMarcgrav.* (* Salmo rhombeus, Linn.) The caribito has a very agreeable\r\nflavour. As no one dares to bathe where it is found, it may be\r\nconsidered as one of the greatest scourges of those climates, in which\r\nthe sting of the mosquitos and the general irritation of the skin\r\nrender the use of baths so necessary.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at noon in a desert spot called Algodonal. I left my\r\ncompanions while they drew the boat ashore and were occupied in\r\npreparing our dinner. I went along the beach to get a near view of a\r\ngroup of crocodiles sleeping in the sun, and lying in such a manner as\r\nto have their tails, which were furnished with broad plates, resting\r\non one another. Some little herons,* white as snow, walked along their\r\nbacks, and even upon their heads, as if passing over trunks of trees.\r\n(* Garzon chico. It is believed, in Upper Egypt, that herons have an\r\naffection for crocodiles, because they take advantage in fishing of\r\nthe terror that monstrous animal causes among the fishes, which he\r\ndrives from the bottom to the surface of the water; but on the banks\r\nof the Nile, the heron keeps prudently at some distance from the\r\ncrocodile.) The crocodiles were of a greenish grey, half covered with\r\ndried mud; from their colour and immobility they might have been taken\r\nfor statues of bronze. This excursion had nearly proved fatal to me. I\r\nhad kept my eyes constantly turned towards the river; but, whilst\r\npicking up some spangles of mica agglomerated together in the sand, I\r\ndiscovered the recent footsteps of a tiger, easily distinguishable\r\nfrom their form and size. The animal had gone towards the forest, and\r\nturning my eyes on that side, I found myself within eighty paces of a\r\njaguar that was lying under the thick foliage of a ceiba. No tiger had\r\never appeared to me so large.\r\n\r\nThere are accidents in life against which we may seek in vain to\r\nfortify our reason. I was extremely alarmed, yet sufficiently master\r\nof myself and of my motions to enable me to follow the advice which\r\nthe Indians had so often given us as to how we ought to act in such\r\ncases. I continued to walk on without running, avoided moving my arms,\r\nand I thought I observed that the jaguar's attention was fixed on a\r\nherd of capybaras which was crossing the river. I then began to\r\nreturn, making a large circuit toward the edge of the water. As the\r\ndistance increased, I thought I might accelerate my pace. How often\r\nwas I tempted to look back in order to assure myself that I was not\r\npursued! Happily I yielded very tardily to this desire. The jaguar had\r\nremained motionless. These enormous cats with spotted robes are so\r\nwell fed in countries abounding in capybaras, pecaries, and deer, that\r\nthey rarely attack men. I arrived at the boat out of breath, and\r\nrelated my adventure to the Indians. They appeared very little\r\ninterested by my story; yet, after having loaded our guns, they\r\naccompanied us to the ceiba beneath which the jaguar had lain. He was\r\nthere no longer, and it would have been imprudent to have pursued him\r\ninto the forest, where we must have dispersed, or advanced in single\r\nfile, amidst the intertwining lianas.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we passed the mouth of the Cano del Manati, thus named\r\non account of the immense quantity of manatees caught there every\r\nyear. This herbivorous animal of the cetaceous family, is called by\r\nthe Indians apcia and avia,* and it attains here generally ten or\r\ntwelve feet in length. (* The first of these words belongs to the\r\nTamanac language, and the second to the Ottomac. Father Gili proves,\r\nin opposition to Oviedo, that manati (fish with hands) is not Spanish,\r\nbut belongs to the languages of Hayti (St. Domingo) and the Maypures.\r\nI believe also that, according to the genius of the Spanish tongue,\r\nthe animal would have been called manudo or manon, but not manati.) It\r\nusually weighs from five hundred to eight hundred pounds, but it is\r\nasserted that one has been taken of eight thousand pounds weight. The\r\nmanatee abounds in the Orinoco below the cataracts, in the Rio Meta,\r\nand in the Apure, between the two islands of Carizales and Conserva.\r\nWe found no vestiges of nails on the external surface or the edges of\r\nthe fins, which are quite smooth; but little rudiments of nails appear\r\nat the third phalanx, when the skin of the fins is taken off. We\r\ndissected one of these animals, which was nine feet long, at\r\nCarichana, a Mission of the Orinoco. The upper lip was four inches\r\nlonger than the lower one. It was covered with a very fine skin, and\r\nserved as a proboscis. The inside of the mouth, which has a sensible\r\nwarmth in an animal newly killed, presented a very singular\r\nconformation. The tongue was almost motionless; but in front of the\r\ntongue there was a fleshy excrescence in each jaw, and a cavity lined\r\nwith a very hard skin, into which the excrescence fitted. The manatee\r\neats such quantities of grass, that we have found its stomach, which\r\nis divided into several cavities, and its intestines, (one hundred and\r\neight feet long,) filled with it. On opening the animal at the back,\r\nwe were struck with the magnitude, form, and situation of its lungs.\r\nThey have very large cells, and resemble immense swimming-bladders.\r\nThey are three feet long. Filled with air, they have a bulk of more\r\nthan a thousand cubic inches. I was surprised to see that, possessing\r\nsuch considerable receptacles for air, the manatee comes so often to\r\nthe surface of the water to breathe. Its flesh is very savoury,\r\nthough, from what prejudice I know not, it is considered unwholesome\r\nand apt to produce fever. It appeared to me to resemble pork rather\r\nthan beef. It is most esteemed by the Guamos and the Ottomacs; and\r\nthese two nations are particularly expert in catching the manatee. Its\r\nflesh, when salted and dried in the sun, can be preserved a whole\r\nyear; and, as the clergy regard this mammiferous animal as a fish, it\r\nis much sought during Lent. The vital principal is singularly strong\r\nin the manatee; it is tied after being harpooned, but is not killed\r\ntill it has been taken into the canoe. This is effected, when the\r\nanimal is very large, in the middle of the river, by filling the canoe\r\ntwo-thirds with water, sliding it under the animal, and then baling\r\nout the water by means of a calabash. This fishery is most easy after\r\ngreat inundations, when the manatee has passed from the great rivers\r\ninto the lakes and surrounding marshes, and the waters diminish\r\nrapidly. At the period when the Jesuits governed the Missions of the\r\nLower Orinoco, they assembled every year at Cabruta, below the mouth\r\nof the Apure, to have a grand fishing for manatees, with the Indians\r\nof their Missions, at the foot of the mountain now called El\r\nCapuchino. The fat of the animal, known by the name of manatee-butter\r\n(manteca de manati,) is used for lamps in the churches; and is also\r\nemployed in preparing food. It has not the fetid smell of whale-oil,\r\nor that of the other cetaceous animals which spout water. The hide of\r\nthe manati, which is more than an inch and a half thick, is cut into\r\nslips, and serves, like thongs of ox-leather, to supply the place of\r\ncordage in the Llanos. When immersed in water, it has the defect of\r\nundergoing a slight degree of putrefaction. Whips are made of it in\r\nthe Spanish colonies. Hence the words latigo and manati are\r\nsynonymous. These whips of manatee-leather are a cruel instrument of\r\npunishment for the unhappy slaves, and even for the Indians of the\r\nMissions, though, according to the laws, the latter ought to be\r\ntreated like freemen.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night opposite the island of Conserva. In skirting the\r\nforest we were surprised by the sight of an enormous trunk of a tree\r\nseventy feet high, and thickly set with branching thorns. It is called\r\nby the natives barba de tigre. It was perhaps a tree of the\r\nberberideous family.* (* We found, on the banks of the Apure, Ammania\r\napurensis, Cordia cordifolia, C. grandiflora, Mollugo sperguloides,\r\nMyosotis lithospermoides, Spermacocce diffusa, Coronilla occidentalis,\r\nBignonia apurensis, Pisonia pubescens, Ruellia viscosa, some new\r\nspecies of Jussieua, and a new genus of the composite family,\r\napproximating to Rolandra, the Trichospira menthoides of M. Kunth.)\r\nThe Indians had kindled fires at the edge of the water. We again\r\nperceived that their light attracted the crocodiles, and even the\r\nporpoises (toninas), the noise of which interrupted our sleep, till\r\nthe fire was extinguished. A female jaguar approached our station\r\nwhilst taking her young one to drink at the river. The Indians\r\nsucceeded in chasing her away, but we heard for a long time the cries\r\nof the little jaguar, which mewed like a young cat. Soon after, our\r\ngreat dog was bitten, or, as the Indians say, stung, at the point of\r\nthe nose, by some enormous bats that hovered around our hammocks.\r\nThese bats had long tails, like the Molosses: I believe, however, that\r\nthey were Phyllostomes, the tongue of which, furnished with papillae,\r\nis an organ of suction, and is capable of being considerably\r\nelongated. The dog's wound was very small and round; and though he\r\nuttered a plaintive cry when he felt himself bitten, it was not from\r\npain, but because he was frightened at the sight of the bats, which\r\ncame out from beneath our hammocks. These accidents are much more rare\r\nthan is believed even in the country itself. In the course of several\r\nyears, notwithstanding we slept so often in the open air, in climates\r\nwhere vampire-bats,* (* Verspertilio spectrum.) and other analogous\r\nspecies are so common, we were never wounded. Besides, the puncture is\r\nno-way dangerous, and in general causes so little pain, that it often\r\ndoes not awaken the person till after the bat has withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of April was the last day we passed on the Rio Apure. The\r\nvegetation of its banks became more and more uniform. During several\r\ndays, and particularly since we had left the Mission of Arichuna, we\r\nhad suffered cruelly from the stings of insects, which covered our\r\nfaces and hands. They were not mosquitos, which have the appearance of\r\nlittle flies, or of the genus Simulium, but zancudos, which are really\r\ngnats, though very different from our European species.* (* M.\r\nLatreille has discovered that the mosquitos of South Carolina are of\r\nthe genus Simulium (Atractocera meigen.) These insects appear only\r\nafter sunset. Their proboscis is so long that, when they fix on the\r\nlower surface of a hammock, they pierce through it and the thickest\r\ngarments with their sting.\r\n\r\nWe had intended to pass the night at the Vuelta del Palmito, but the\r\nnumber of jaguars at that part of the Apure is so great, that our\r\nIndians found two hidden behind the trunk of a locust-tree, at the\r\nmoment when they were going to sling our hammocks. We were advised to\r\nre-embark, and take our station in the island of Apurito, near its\r\njunction with the Orinoco. That portion of the island belongs to the\r\nprovince of Caracas, while the right banks of the Apure and the\r\nOrinoco form a part, the one of the province of Varinas, the other of\r\nSpanish Guiana. We found no trees to which we could suspend our\r\nhammocks, and were obliged to sleep on ox-hides spread on the ground.\r\nThe boats were too narrow and too full of zancudos to permit us to\r\npass the night in them.\r\n\r\nIn the place where we had landed our instruments, the banks being\r\nsteep, we saw new proofs of the indolence of the gallinaceous birds of\r\nthe tropics. The curassaos and cashew-birds* have the habit of going\r\ndown several times a day to the river to allay their thirst. (* The\r\nlatter (Crax pauxi) is less common than the former.) They drink a\r\ngreat deal, and at short intervals. A vast number of these birds had\r\njoined, near our station, a flock of parraka pheasants. They had great\r\ndifficulty in climbing up the steep banks; they attempted it several\r\ntimes without using their wings. We drove them before us, as if we had\r\nbeen driving sheep. The zamuro vultures raise themselves from the\r\nground with great reluctance.\r\n\r\nWe were singularly struck at the small quantity of water which the Rio\r\nApure furnishes at this season to the Orinoco. The Apure, which,\r\naccording to my measurements, was still one hundred and thirty-six\r\ntoises broad at the Cano Rico, was only sixty or eighty at its mouth.*\r\n(* Not quite so broad as the Seine at the Pont Royal, opposite the\r\npalace of the Tuileries, and a little more than half the width of the\r\nThames at Westminster Bridge.) Its depth here was only three or four\r\ntoises. It loses, no doubt, a part of its waters by the Rio Arichuna\r\nand the Cano del Manati, two branches of the Apure that flow into the\r\nPayara and the Guarico; but its greatest loss appears to be caused by\r\nfiltrations on the beach, of which we have before spoken. The velocity\r\nof the Apure near its mouth was only 3.2 feet per second; so that I\r\ncould easily have calculated the whole quantity of the water if I had\r\ntaken, by a series of proximate soundings, the whole dimensions of the\r\ntransverse section.\r\n\r\nWe touched several times on shoals before we entered the Orinoco. The\r\nground gained from the water is immense towards the confluence of the\r\ntwo rivers. We were obliged to be towed along by the bank. What a\r\ncontrast between this state of the river immediately before the\r\nentrance of the rainy season, when all the effects of dryness of the\r\nair and of evaporation have attained their maximum, and that autumnal\r\nstate when the Apure, like an arm of the sea, covers the savannahs as\r\nfar as the eye can reach! We discerned towards the south the lonely\r\nhills of Coruato; while to the east the granite rocks of Curiquima,\r\nthe Sugar Loaf of Caycara, and the mountains of the Tyrant* (Cerros\r\ndel Tirano) began to rise on the horizon. (* This name alludes, no\r\ndoubt, to the expedition of Antonio Sedeno. The port of Caycara,\r\nopposite Cabruta, still bears the name of that Conquistador.) It was\r\nnot without emotion that we beheld for the first time, after long\r\nexpectation, the waters of the Orinoco, at a point so distant from the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.19.\r\n\r\nJUNCTION OF THE APURE AND THE ORINOCO.\r\nMOUNTAINS OF ENCARAMADA.\r\nURUANA.\r\nBARAGUAN.\r\nCARICHANA.\r\nMOUTH OF THE META.\r\nISLAND OF PANUMANA.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Rio Apure we found ourselves in a country presenting a\r\ntotally different aspect. An immense plain of water stretched before\r\nus like a lake, as far as we could see. White-topped waves rose to the\r\nheight of several feet, from the conflict of the breeze and the\r\ncurrent. The air resounded no longer with the piercing cries of\r\nherons, flamingos, and spoonbills, crossing in long files from one\r\nshore to the other. Our eyes sought in vain those waterfowls, the\r\nhabits of which vary in each tribe. All nature appeared less animated.\r\nScarcely could we discover in the hollows of the waves a few large\r\ncrocodiles, cutting obliquely, by the help of their long tails, the\r\nsurface of the agitated waters. The horizon was bounded by a zone of\r\nforests, which nowhere reached so far as the bed of the river. A vast\r\nbeach, constantly parched by the heat of the sun, desert and bare as\r\nthe shores of the sea, resembled at a distance, from the effect of the\r\nmirage, pools of stagnant water. These sandy shores, far from fixing\r\nthe limits of the river, render them uncertain, by enlarging or\r\ncontracting them alternately, according to the variable action of the\r\nsolar rays.\r\n\r\nIn these scattered features of the landscape, in this character of\r\nsolitude and of greatness, we recognize the course of the Orinoco, one\r\nof the most majestic rivers of the New World. The water, like the\r\nland, displays everywhere a characteristic and peculiar aspect. The\r\nbed of the Orinoco resembles not the bed of the Meta, the Guaviare,\r\nthe Rio Negro, or the Amazon. These differences do not depend\r\naltogether on the breadth or the velocity of the current; they are\r\nconnected with a multitude of impressions which it is easier to\r\nperceive upon the spot than to define with precision. Thus, the mere\r\nform of the waves, the tint of the waters, the aspect of the sky and\r\nthe clouds, would lead an experienced navigator to guess whether he\r\nwere in the Atlantic, in the Mediterranean, or in the equinoctial part\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew fresh from east-north-east. Its direction was favourable\r\nfor sailing up the Orinoco, towards the Mission of Encaramada; but our\r\ncanoes were so ill calculated to resist the shocks of the waves, that,\r\nfrom the violence of the motion, those who suffered habitually at sea\r\nwere equally incommoded on the river. The short, broken waves are\r\ncaused by the conflict of the waters at the junction of the two\r\nrivers. This conflict is very violent, but far from being so dangerous\r\nas Father Gumilla describes. We passed the Punta Curiquima, which is\r\nan isolated mass of quartzose granite, a small promontory composed of\r\nrounded blocks. There, on the right bank of the Orinoco, Father\r\nRotella founded, in the time of the Jesuits, a Mission of the Palenka\r\nand Viriviri or Guire Indians. But during inundations, the rock\r\nCuriquima and the village at its foot were entirely surrounded by\r\nwater; and this serious inconvenience, together with the sufferings of\r\nthe missionaries and Indians from the innumerable quantity of\r\nmosquitos and niguas,* led them to forsake this humid spot. (* The\r\nchego (Pulex penetrans) which penetrates under the nails of the toe in\r\nmen and monkeys, and there deposits its eggs.) It is now entirely\r\ndeserted, while opposite to it, on the right bank of the river, the\r\nlittle mountains of Coruato are the retreat of wandering Indians,\r\nexpelled either from the Missions, or from tribes that are not subject\r\nto the government of the monks.\r\n\r\nStruck with the extreme breadth of the Orinoco, between the mouth of\r\nthe Apure and the rock Curiquima, I ascertained it by means of a base\r\nmeasured twice on the western beach. The bed of the Orinoco, at low\r\nwater, was 1906 toises broad; but this breadth increases to 5517\r\ntoises, when, in the rainy season, the rock Curiquima, and the farm of\r\nCapuchino near the hill of Pocopocori, become islands. The swelling of\r\nthe Orinoco is augmented by the impulse of the waters of the Apure,\r\nwhich, far from forming, like other rivers, an acute angle with the\r\nupper part of that into which it flows, meets it at right angles.\r\n\r\nWe first proceeded south-west, as far as the shore inhabited by the\r\nGuaricoto Indians on the left bank of the Orinoco, and then we\r\nadvanced straight toward the south. The river is so broad that the\r\nmountains of Encaramada appear to rise from the water, as if seen\r\nabove the horizon of the sea. They form a continued chain from east to\r\nwest. These mountains are composed of enormous blocks of granite,\r\ncleft and piled one upon another. Their division into blocks is the\r\neffect of decomposition. What contributes above all to embellish the\r\nscene at Encaramada is the luxuriance of vegetation that covers the\r\nsides of the rocks, leaving bare only their rounded summits. They look\r\nlike ancient ruins rising in the midst of a forest. The mountain\r\nimmediately at the back of the Mission, the Tepupano* of the Tamanac\r\nIndians is terminated by three enormous granitic cylinders, two of\r\nwhich are inclined, while the third, though worn at its base, and more\r\nthan eighty feet high, has preserved a vertical position. (*\r\nTepu-pano, place of stones, in which we recognize tepu stone, rock, as\r\nin tepu-iri, mountain. We here perceive that Lesgian Oigour-Tartar\r\nroot tep, stone (found in America among the Americans, in teptl; among\r\nthe Caribs, in tebou; among the Tamanacs, in tepuiri); a striking\r\nanalogy between the languages of Caucasus and Upper Asia and those of\r\nthe banks of the Orinoco.) This rock, which calls to mind the form of\r\nthe Schnarcher in the Hartz mountains, or that of the Organs of\r\nActopan in Mexico,* composed formerly a part of the rounded summit of\r\nthe mountain. (* In Captain Tuckey's Voyage on the river Congo, we\r\nfind represented a granitic rock, Taddi Enzazi, which bears a striking\r\nresemblance to the mountain of Encaramada.) In every climate,\r\nunstratified granite separates by decomposition into blocks of\r\nprismatic, cylindric, or columnar figures.\r\n\r\nOpposite the shore of the Guaricotos, we drew near another heap of\r\nrocks, which is very low, and three or four toises long. It rises in\r\nthe midst of the plain, and has less resemblance to a tumulus than to\r\nthose masses of granitic stone, which in North Holland and Germany\r\nbear the name of hunenbette, beds (or tombs) of heroes. The shore, at\r\nthis part of the Orinoco, is no longer of pure and quartzose sand; but\r\nis composed of clay and spangles of mica, deposited in very thin\r\nstrata, and generally at an inclination of forty or fifty degrees. It\r\nlooks like decomposed mica-slate. This change in the geological\r\nconfiguration of the shore extends far beyond the mouth of the Apure.\r\nWe had begun to observe it in this latter river as far off as\r\nAlgodonal and the Cano del Manati. The spangles of mica come, no\r\ndoubt, from the granite mountains of Curiquima and Encaramada; since\r\nfurther north-east we find only quartzose sand, sandstone, compact\r\nlimestone, and gypsum. Alluvial earth carried successively from south\r\nto north need not surprise us in the Orinoco; but to what shall we\r\nattribute the same phenomenon in the bed of the Apure, seven leagues\r\nwest of its mouth? In the present state of things, notwithstanding the\r\nswellings of the Orinoco, the waters of the Apure never retrograde so\r\nfar; and, to explain this phenomenon, we are forced to admit that the\r\nmicaceous strata were deposited at a time when the whole of the very\r\nlow country lying between Caycara, Algodonal, and the mountains of\r\nEncaramada, formed the basin of an inland lake.\r\n\r\nWe stopped some time at the port of Encaramada, which is a sort of\r\nembarcadero, a place where boats assemble. A rock of forty or fifty\r\nfeet high forms the shore. It is composed of blocks of granite, heaped\r\none upon another, as at the Schneeberg in Franconia, and in almost all\r\nthe granitic mountains of Europe. Some of these detached masses have a\r\nspheroidal form; they are not balls with concentric layers, but merely\r\nrounded blocks, nuclei separated from their envelopes by the effect of\r\ndecomposition. This granite is of a greyish lead-colour, often black,\r\nas if covered with oxide of manganese; but this colour does not\r\npenetrate one fifth of a line into the rock, which is of a reddish\r\nwhite colour within, coarse-grained, and destitute of hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe Indian names of the Mission of San Luis del Encaramada, are Guaja\r\nand Caramana.* (* All the Missions of South America have names\r\ncomposed of two words, the first of which is necessarily the name of a\r\nsaint, the patron of the church, and the second an Indian name, that\r\nof the nation, or the spot where the establishment is placed. Thus we\r\nsay, San Jose de Maypures, Santa Cruz de Cachipo, San Juan Nepomuceno\r\nde los Atures, etc. These compound names appear only in official\r\ndocuments; the Inhabitants adopt but one of the two names, and\r\ngenerally, provided it be sonorous, the Indian. As the names of saints\r\nare several times repeated in neighbouring places, great confusion in\r\ngeography arises from these repetitions. The names of San Juan, San\r\nDiego, and San Pedro, are scattered in our maps as if by chance. It is\r\npretended that the Mission of Guaja affords a very rare example of the\r\ncomposition of two Spanish words. The word Encaramada means things\r\nraised one upon another, from encaramar, to raise up. It is derived\r\nfrom the figure of Tepupano and the neighbouring rocks: perhaps it is\r\nonly an Indian word caramana, in which, as in manati, a Spanish\r\nsignification was believed to be discovered.) This small village was\r\nfounded in 1749 by Father Gili, the Jesuit, author of the Storia dell'\r\nOrinoco, published at Rome. This missionary, learned in the Indian\r\ntongues, lived in these solitudes during eighteen years, till the\r\nexpulsion of the Jesuits. To form a precise idea of the savage state\r\nof these countries it must be recollected that Father Gili speaks of\r\nCarichana,* which is forty leagues from Encaramada, as of a spot far\r\ndistant; and that he never advanced so far as the first cataract in\r\nthe river of which he ventured to undertake the description. (* Saggio\r\ndi Storia Americana volume 1 page 122.)\r\n\r\nIn the port of Encaramada we met with some Caribs of Panapana. A\r\ncacique was going up the Orinoco in his canoe, to join in the famous\r\nfishing of turtles' eggs. His canoe was rounded toward the bottom like\r\na bongo, and followed by a smaller boat called a curiara. He was\r\nseated beneath a sort of tent, constructed, like the sail, of\r\npalm-leaves. His cold and silent gravity, the respect with which he\r\nwas treated by his attendants, everything denoted him to be a person\r\nof importance. He was equipped, however, in the same manner as his\r\nIndians. They were all equally naked, armed with bows and arrows, and\r\npainted with onoto, which is the colouring fecula of the Bixa\r\norellana. The chief, the domestics, the furniture, the boat, and the\r\nsail, were all painted red. These Caribs are men of an almost athletic\r\nstature; they appeared to us much taller than any Indians we had\r\nhitherto seen. Their smooth and thick hair, cut short on the forehead\r\nlike that of choristers, their eyebrows painted black, their look at\r\nonce gloomy and animated, gave a singular expression to their\r\ncountenances. Having till then seen only the skulls of some Caribs of\r\nthe West India Islands preserved in the collections of Europe, we were\r\nsurprised to find that these Indians, who were of pure race, had\r\nforeheads much more rounded than they are described. The women, who\r\nwere very tall, and disgusting from their want of cleanliness, carried\r\ntheir infants on their backs. The thighs and legs of the infants were\r\nbound at certain distances by broad strips of cotton cloth, and the\r\nflesh, strongly compressed beneath the ligatures, was swelled in the\r\ninterstices. It is generally to be observed, that the Caribs are as\r\nattentive to their exterior and their ornaments, as it is possible for\r\nmen to be, who are naked and painted red. They attach great importance\r\nto certain configurations of the body; and a mother would be accused\r\nof culpable indifference toward her children, if she did not employ\r\nartificial means to shape the calf of the leg after the fashion of the\r\ncountry. As none of our Indians of Apure understood the Caribbee\r\nlanguage, we could obtain no information from the cacique of Panama\r\nrespecting the encampments that are made at this season in several\r\nislands of the Orinoco for collecting turtles' eggs.\r\n\r\nNear Encaramada a very long island divides the river into two\r\nbranches. We passed the night in a rocky creek, opposite the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Cabullare, which is formed by the Payara and the Atamaica, and\r\nis sometimes considered as one of the branches of the Apure, because\r\nit communicates with that river by the Rio Arichuna. The evening was\r\nbeautiful. The moon illumined the tops of the granite rocks. The heat\r\nwas so uniformly distributed, that, notwithstanding the humidity of\r\nthe air, no twinkling of the stars was observable, even at four or\r\nfive degrees above the horizon. The light of the planets was\r\nsingularly dimmed; and if, on account of the smallness of the apparent\r\ndiameter of Jupiter, I had not suspected some error in the\r\nobservation, I should say, that here, for the first time, we thought\r\nwe distinguished the disk of Jupiter with the naked eye. Towards\r\nmidnight, the north-east wind became extremely violent. It brought no\r\nclouds, but the vault of the sky was covered more and more with\r\nvapours. Strong gusts were felt, and made us fear for the safety of\r\nour canoe. During this whole day we had seen very few crocodiles, but\r\nall of an extraordinary size, from twenty to twenty-four feet. The\r\nIndians assured us that the young crocodiles prefer the marshes, and\r\nthe rivers that are less broad, and less deep. They crowd together\r\nparticularly in the Canos, and we may say of them, what Abdallatif\r\nsays of the crocodiles of the Nile,* \"that they swarm like worms in\r\nthe shallow waters of the river, and in the shelter of uninhabited\r\nislands.\" (* Description de l'Egypte translated by De Sacy.)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of April, whilst continuing to ascend the Orinoco, first\r\nsouthward and then to south-west, we perceived the southern side of\r\nthe Serrania, or chain of the mountains of Encaramada. The part\r\nnearest the river is only one hundred and forty or one hundred and\r\nsixty toises high; but from its abrupt declivities, its situation in\r\nthe midst of a savannah, and its rocky summits, cut into shapeless\r\nprisms, the Serrania appears singularly elevated. Its greatest breadth\r\nis only three leagues. According to information given me by the\r\nIndians of the Pareka nation, it is considerably wider toward the\r\neast. The summits of Encaramada form the northernmost link of a group\r\nof mountains which border the right bank of the Orinoco, between the\r\nlatitudes of 5 degrees and 7 degrees 30 minutes from the mouth of the\r\nRio Zama to that of the Cabullare. The different links into which this\r\ngroup is divided are separated by little grassy plains. They do not\r\npreserve a direction perfectly parallel to each other; for the most\r\nnorthern stretch from west to east, and the most southern from\r\nnorth-west to south-east. This change of direction sufficiently\r\nexplains the increase of breadth observed in the Cordillera of Parime\r\ntowards the east, between the sources of the Orinoco and of the Rio\r\nParuspa. On penetrating beyond the great cataracts of Atures and of\r\nMaypures, we shall see seven principal links, those of Encaramada or\r\nSacuina, of Chaviripa, of Baraguan, of Carichana, of Uniama, of\r\nCalitamini, and of Sipapo, successively appear. This sketch may serve\r\nto give a general idea of the geological configuration of the ground.\r\nWe recognize everywhere on the globe a tendency toward regular forms,\r\nin those mountains that appear the most irregularly grouped. Every\r\nlink appears, in a transverse section, like a distinct summit, to\r\nthose who navigate the Orinoco; but this division is merely in\r\nappearance. The regularity in the direction and separation of the\r\nlinks seems to diminish in proportion as we advance towards the east.\r\nThe mountains of Encaramada join those of Mato, which give birth to\r\nthe Rio Asiveru or Cuchivero; those of Chaviripe are prolonged by the\r\ngranite chain of the Corosal, of Amoco, and of Murcielago, towards the\r\nsources of the Erevato and the Ventuari.\r\n\r\nIt was across these mountains, which are inhabited by Indians of\r\ngentle character, employed in agriculture,* (* The Mapoyes, Parecas,\r\nJavaranas, and Curacicanas, who possess fine plantations (conucos) in\r\nthe savannahs by which these forests are bounded.) that, at the time\r\nof the expedition for settling boundaries, General Iturriaga took some\r\nhorned cattle for the supply of the new town of San Fernando de\r\nAtabapo. The inhabitants of Encaramada then showed the Spanish\r\nsoldiers the way by the Rio Manapiari,* which falls into the Ventuari.\r\n(* Between Encaramada and the Rio Manapiare, Don Miguel Sanchez, chief\r\nof this little expedition, crossed the Rio Guainaima, which flows into\r\nthe Cuchivero. Sanchez died, from the fatigue of this journey, on the\r\nborders of the Ventuari.) By descending these two rivers, the Orinoco\r\nand the Atabapo may be reached without passing the great cataracts,\r\nwhich present almost insurmountable obstacles to the conveyance of\r\ncattle. The spirit of enterprise which had so eminently distinguished\r\nthe Castilians at the period of the discovery of America, was again\r\nroused for a time in the middle of the eighteenth century, when\r\nFerdinand VI was desirous of knowing the true limits of his vast\r\npossessions; and in the forests of Guiana, that land of fiction and\r\nfabulous tradition, the wily Indians revived the chimerical idea of\r\nthe wealth of El Dorado, which had so much occupied the imagination of\r\nthe first conquerors.\r\n\r\nAmidst the mountains of Encaramada, which, like most coarse-grained\r\ngranite rocks, are destitute of metallic veins, we cannot help\r\ninquiring whence came those grains of gold which Juan Martinez* (* The\r\ncompanion of Diego Ordaz.) and Raleigh profess to have seen in such\r\nabundance in the hands of the Indians of the Orinoco. From what I\r\nobserved in that part of America, I am led to think that gold, like\r\ntin,* is sometimes disseminated in an almost imperceptible manner in\r\nthe very mass of granite rocks, without our being able to perceive\r\nthat there is a ramification and an intertwining of small veins. (*\r\nThus tin is found in granite of recent formation, at Geyer; in\r\nhyalomicte or graisen, at Zinnwald; and in syenitic porphyry, at\r\nAltenberg, in Saxony, as well as near Naila, in the Fichtelgebirge. I\r\nhave also seen, in the Upper Palatinate, micaceous iron, and black\r\nearthy cobalt, far from any kind of vein, disseminated in a granite\r\ndestitute of mica, as magnetic iron-sand is in volcanic rocks.) Not\r\nlong ago the Indians of Encaramada found in the Quebrada del Tigre* (*\r\nThe Tiger-ravine.) a piece of native gold two lines in diameter. It\r\nwas rounded, and appeared to have been washed along by the waters.\r\nThis discovery excited the attention of the missionaries much more\r\nthan of the natives; it was followed by no other of the same kind.\r\n\r\nI cannot quit this first link of the mountains of Encaramada without\r\nrecalling to mind a fact that was not unknown to Father Gili, and\r\nwhich was often mentioned to me during our abode in the Missions of\r\nthe Orinoco. The natives of those countries have retained the belief\r\nthat, \"at the time of the great waters, when their fathers were forced\r\nto have recourse to boats, to escape the general inundation, the waves\r\nof the sea beat against the rocks of Encaramada.\" This belief is not\r\nconfined to one nation singly, the Tamanacs; it makes part of a system\r\nof historical tradition, of which we find scattered notions among the\r\nMaypures of the great cataracts; among the Indians of the Rio Erevato,\r\nwhich runs into the Caura; and among almost all the tribes of the\r\nUpper Orinoco. When the Tamanacs are asked how the human race survived\r\nthis great deluge, the age of water, of the Mexicans, they say, a man\r\nand a woman saved themselves on a high mountain, called Tamanacu,\r\nsituated on the banks of the Asiveru; and casting behind them, over\r\ntheir heads, the fruits of the mauritia palm-tree, they saw the seeds\r\ncontained in those fruits produce men and women, who repeopled the\r\nearth. Thus we find in all its simplicity, among nations now in a\r\nsavage state, a tradition which the Greeks embellished with all the\r\ncharms of imagination! A few leagues from Encaramada, a rock, called\r\nTepu-mereme, or the painted rock, rises in the midst of the savannah.\r\nUpon it are traced representations of animals, and symbolic figures\r\nresembling those we saw in going down the Orinoco, at a small distance\r\nbelow Encaramada, near the town Caycara. Similar rocks in Africa are\r\ncalled by travellers fetish stones. I shall not make use of this term,\r\nbecause fetishism does not prevail among the natives of the Orinoco;\r\nand the figures of stars, of the sun, of tigers, and of crocodiles,\r\nwhich we found traced upon the rocks in spots now uninhabited,\r\nappeared to me in no way to denote the objects of worship of those\r\nnations. Between the banks of the Cassiquiare and the Orinoco, between\r\nEncaramada, the Capuchino, and Caycara, these hieroglyphic figures are\r\noften seen at great heights, on rocky cliffs which could be accessible\r\nonly by constructing very lofty scaffolds. When the natives are asked\r\nhow those figures could have been sculptured, they answer with a\r\nsmile, as if relating a fact of which only a white man could be\r\nignorant, that \"at the period of the great waters, their fathers went\r\nto that height in boats.\"\r\n\r\nThese ancient traditions of the human race, which we find dispersed\r\nover the whole surface of the globe, like the relics of a vast\r\nshipwreck, are highly interesting in the philosophical study of our\r\nown species. Like certain families of the vegetable kingdom, which,\r\nnotwithstanding the diversity of climates and the influence of\r\nheights, retain the impression of a common type, the traditions of\r\nnations respecting the origin of the world, display everywhere the\r\nsame physiognomy, and preserve features of resemblance that fill us\r\nwith astonishment. How many different tongues, belonging to branches\r\nthat appear totally distinct, transmit to us the same facts! The\r\ntraditions concerning races that have been destroyed, and the renewal\r\nof nature, scarcely vary in reality, though every nation gives them a\r\nlocal colouring. In the great continents, as in the smallest islands\r\nof the Pacific Ocean, it is always on the loftiest and nearest\r\nmountain that the remains of the human race have been saved; and this\r\nevent appears the more recent, in proportion as the nations are\r\nuncultivated, and as the knowledge they have of their own existence\r\nhas no very remote date. After having studied with attention the\r\nMexican monuments anterior to the discovery of the New World; after\r\nhaving penetrated into the forests of the Orinoco, and observed the\r\ndiminutive size of the European establishments, their solitude, and\r\nthe state of the tribes that have remained independent; we cannot\r\nallow ourselves to attribute the analogies just cited to the influence\r\nexercised by the missionaries, and by Christianity, on the national\r\ntraditions. Nor is it more probable, that the discovery of sea-shells\r\non the summit of mountains gave birth, among the nations of the\r\nOrinoco, to the tradition of some great inundation which extinguished\r\nfor a time the germs of organic life on our globe. The country that\r\nextends from the right bank of the Orinoco to the Cassiquiare and the\r\nRio Negro, is a country of primitive rocks. I saw there one small\r\nformation of sandstone or conglomerate; but no secondary limestone,\r\nand no trace of petrifactions.\r\n\r\nA fresh north-east breeze carried us full-sail towards the Boca de la\r\nTortuga. We landed, at eleven in the morning, on an island which the\r\nIndians of the Missions of Uruana considered as their property, and\r\nwhich lies in the middle of the river. This island is celebrated for\r\nthe turtle fishery, or, as they say here, the cosecha, the harvest [of\r\neggs,] that takes place annually. We here found an assemblage of\r\nIndians, encamped under huts made of palm-leaves. This encampment\r\ncontained more than three hundred persons. Accustomed, since we had\r\nleft San Fernando de Apure, to see only desert shores, we were\r\nsingularly struck by the bustle that prevailed here. We found, besides\r\nthe Guamos and the Ottomacs of Uruana, who are both considered as\r\nsavage races, Caribs and other Indians of the Lower Orinoco. Every\r\ntribe was separately encamped, and was distinguished by the pigments\r\nwith which their skins were painted. Some white men were seen amidst\r\nthis tumultuous assemblage, chiefly pulperos, or little traders of\r\nAngostura, who had come up the river to purchase turtle oil from the\r\nnatives. The missionary of Uruana, a native of Alcala, came to meet\r\nus, and he was extremely astonished at seeing us. After having admired\r\nour instruments, he gave us an exaggerated picture of the sufferings\r\nto which we should be necessarily exposed in ascending the Orinoco\r\nbeyond the cataracts. The object of our journey appeared to him very\r\nmysterious. \"How is it possible to believe,\" said he, \"that you have\r\nleft your country, to come and be devoured by mosquitos on this river,\r\nand to measure lands that are not your own?\" We were happily furnished\r\nwith recommendations from the Superior of the Franciscan Missions, and\r\nthe brother-in-law of the governor of Varinas, who accompanied us,\r\nsoon dissipated the doubts to which our dress, our accent, and our\r\narrival in this sandy island, had given rise among the Whites. The\r\nmissionary invited us to partake a frugal repast of fish and\r\nplantains. He told us that he had come to encamp with the Indians\r\nduring the time of the harvest of eggs, \"to celebrate mass every\r\nmorning in the open air, to procure the oil necessary for the\r\nchurch-lamps, and especially to govern this mixed republic (republica\r\nde Indios y Castellanos) in which every one wished to profit singly by\r\nwhat God had granted to all.\"\r\n\r\nWe made the tour of the island, accompanied by the missionary and by a\r\npulpero, who boasted of having, for ten successive years, visited the\r\ncamp of the Indians, and attended the turtle-fishery. We were on a\r\nplain of sand perfectly smooth; and were told that, as far as we could\r\nsee along the beach, turtles' eggs were concealed under a layer of\r\nearth. The missionary carried a long pole in his hand. He showed us,\r\nthat by means of this pole, the extent of the stratum of eggs could be\r\ndetermined as accurately as the miner determines the limits of a bed\r\nof marl, of bog iron-ore, or of coal. On thrusting the rod\r\nperpendicularly into the ground, the sudden want of resistance shows\r\nthat the cavity or layer of loose earth containing the eggs, has been\r\nreached. We saw that the stratum is generally spread with so much\r\nuniformity, that the pole finds it everywhere in a radius of ten\r\ntoises around any given spot. Here they talk continually of square\r\nperches of eggs; it is like a mining-country, divided into lots, and\r\nworked with the greatest regularity. The stratum of eggs, however, is\r\nfar from covering the whole island: they are not found wherever the\r\nground rises abruptly, because the turtle cannot mount heights. I\r\nrelated to my guides the emphatic description of Father Gumilla, who\r\nasserts, that the shores of the Orinoco contain fewer grains of sand\r\nthan the river contains turtles; and that these animals would prevent\r\nvessels from advancing, if men and tigers did not annually destroy so\r\ngreat a number.* (* \"It would be as difficult to count the grains of\r\nsand on the shores of the Orinoco, as to count the immense number of\r\ntortoises which inhabit its margins and waters. Were it not for the\r\nvast consumption of tortoises and their eggs, the river Orinoco,\r\ndespite its great magnitude, would be unnavigable, for vessels would\r\nbe impeded by the enormous multitude of the tortoises.\" Gumilla,\r\nOrinoco Illustrata volume 1 pages 331 to 336.) \"Son cuentos de\r\nfrailes,\" \"they are monkish legends,\" said the pulpero of Angostura,\r\nin a low voice; for the only travellers in this country being the\r\nmissionaries, they here call monks' stories, what we call travellers'\r\ntales, in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Indians assured us that, in going up the Orinoco from its mouth to\r\nits junction with the Apure, not one island or one beach is to be\r\nfound, where eggs can be collected in abundance. The great turtle\r\n(arrau* (* This word belongs to the Maypure language, and must not be\r\nconfounded with arua, which means a crocodile, among the Tamanacs,\r\nneighbours of the Maypures. The Ottomacs call the turtle of Uruana,\r\nachea; the Tamanacs, peje.)) dreads places inhabited by men, or much\r\nfrequented by boats. It is a timid and mistrustful animal, raising\r\nonly its head above the water, and hiding itself at the least noise.\r\nThe shores where almost all the turtles of the Orinoco appear to\r\nassemble annually, are situated between the junction of the Orinoco\r\nwith the Apure, and the great cataracts; that is to say, between\r\nCabruta and the Mission of Atures. There are found the three famous\r\nfisheries; those of Encaramada, or Boca del Cabullare; of Cucuruparu,\r\nor Boca de la Tortuga; and of Pararuma, a little below Carichana. It\r\nseems that the arrau does not pass beyond the cataracts; and we were\r\nassured, that only the turtles called terekay, (in Spanish terecayas,)\r\nare found above Atures and Maypures.\r\n\r\nThe arrau, called by the Spaniards of the Missions simply tortuga, is\r\nan animal whose existence is of great importance to the nations on the\r\nLower Orinoco. It is a large freshwater tortoise, with palmate and\r\nmembraneous feet; the head very flat, with two fleshy and\r\nacutely-pointed appendages under the chin; five claws to the fore\r\nfeet, and four to the hind feet, which are furrowed underneath. The\r\nupper shell has five central, eight lateral, and twenty-four marginal\r\nplates. The colour is darkish grey above, and orange beneath. The feet\r\nare yellow, and very long. There is a deep furrow between the eyes.\r\nThe claws are very strong and crooked. The anus is placed at the\r\ndistance of one-fifth from the extremity of the tail. The full-grown\r\nanimal weighs from forty to fifty pounds. Its eggs are much larger\r\nthan those of pigeons, and less elongated than the eggs of the\r\nterekay. They are covered with a calcareous crust, and, it is said,\r\nthey have sufficient firmness for the children of the Ottomac Indians,\r\nwho are great players at ball, to throw them into the air from one to\r\nanother. If the arrau inhabited the bed of the river above the\r\ncataracts, the Indians of the Upper Orinoco would not travel so far to\r\nprocure the flesh and the eggs of this tortoise. Yet, formerly, whole\r\ntribes from the Atabapo and the Cassiquiare have been known to pass\r\nthe cataracts, in order to take part in the fishery at Uruana.\r\n\r\nThe terekay is less than the arrau. It is in general only fourteen\r\ninches in diameter. The number of plates in the upper shell is the\r\nsame, but they are somewhat differently arranged. I counted three in\r\nthe centre of the disk, and five hexagonal on each side. The margins\r\ncontain twenty-four, all quadrangular, and much curved. The upper\r\nshell is of a black colour inclining to green; the feet and claws are\r\nlike those of the arrau. The whole animal is of an olive-green, but it\r\nhas two spots of red mixed with yellow on the top of the head. The\r\nthroat is also yellow, and furnished with a prickly appendage. The\r\nterekays do not assemble in numerous societies like the arraus, to lay\r\ntheir eggs in common, and deposit them upon the same shore. The eggs\r\nof the terekay have an agreeable taste, and are much sought after by\r\nthe inhabitants of Spanish Guiana. They are found in the Upper\r\nOrinoco, as well as below the cataracts, and even in the Apure, the\r\nUritucu, the Guarico, and the small rivers that traverse the Llanos of\r\nCaracas. The form of the feet and head, the appendages of the chin and\r\nthroat, and the position of the anus, seem to indicate that the arrau,\r\nand probably the terekay also, belong to a new subdivision of the\r\ntortoises, that may be separated from the emydes. The period at which\r\nthe large arrau tortoise lays its eggs coincides with the period of\r\nthe lowest waters. The Orinoco beginning to increase from the vernal\r\nequinox, the lowest flats are found uncovered from the end of January\r\ntill the 20th or 25th of March. The arrau tortoises collect in troops\r\nin the month of January, then issue from the water, and warm\r\nthemselves in the sun, reposing on the sands. The Indians believe that\r\ngreat heat is indispensable to the health of the animal, and that its\r\nexposure to the sun favours the laying of the eggs. The arraus are\r\nfound on the beach a great part of the day during the whole month of\r\nFebruary. At the beginning of March the straggling troops assemble,\r\nand swim towards the small number of islands on which they habitually\r\ndeposit their eggs. It is probable that the same tortoise returns\r\nevery year to the same locality. At this period, a few days before\r\nthey lay their eggs, thousands of these animals may be seen ranged in\r\nlong files, on the borders of the islands of Cucuruparu, Uruana, and\r\nPararuma, stretching out their necks and holding their heads above\r\nwater, to see whether they have anything to dread. The Indians, who\r\nare anxious that the bands when assembled should not separate, that\r\nthe tortoises should not disperse, and that the laying of the eggs\r\nshould be performed tranquilly, place sentinels at certain distances\r\nalong the shore. The people who pass in boats are told to keep in the\r\nmiddle of the river, and not frighten the tortoises by cries. The\r\nlaying of the eggs takes place always during the night, and it begins\r\nsoon after sunset. With its hind feet, which are very long, and\r\nfurnished with crooked claws, the animal digs a hole of three feet in\r\ndiameter and two in depth. These tortoises feel so pressing a desire\r\nto lay their eggs, that some of them descend into holes that have been\r\ndug by others, but which are not yet covered with earth. There they\r\ndeposit a new layer of eggs on that which has been recently laid. In\r\nthis tumultuous movement an immense number of eggs are broken. The\r\nmissionary showed us, by removing the sand in several places, that\r\nthis loss probably amounts to a fifth of the whole quantity. The yolk\r\nof the broken eggs contributes, in drying, to cement the sand; and we\r\nfound very large concretions of grains of quartz and broken shells.\r\nThe number of animals working on the beach during the night is so\r\nconsiderable, that day surprises many of them before the laying of\r\ntheir eggs is terminated. They are then urged on by the double\r\nnecessity of depositing their eggs, and closing the holes they have\r\ndug, that they may not be perceived by the jaguars. The tortoises that\r\nthus remain too late are insensible to their own danger. They work in\r\nthe presence of the Indians, who visit the beach at a very early hour,\r\nand who call them mad tortoises. Notwithstanding the rapidity of their\r\nmovements, they are then easily caught with the hand.\r\n\r\nThe three encampments formed by the Indians, in the places indicated\r\nabove, begin about the end of March or commencement of April. The\r\ngathering of the eggs is conducted in a uniform manner, and with that\r\nregularity which characterises all monastic institutions. Before the\r\narrival of the missionaries on the banks of the river, the Indians\r\nprofited much less from a production which nature has supplied in such\r\nabundance. Every tribe searched the beach in its own way; and an\r\nimmense number of eggs were uselessly broken, because they were not\r\ndug up with precaution, and more eggs were uncovered than could be\r\ncarried away. It was like a mine worked by unskilful hands. The\r\nJesuits have the merit of having reduced this operation to regularity;\r\nand though the Franciscan monks, who succeeded the Jesuits in the\r\nMissions of the Orinoco, boast of having followed the example of their\r\npredecessors, they unhappily do not effect all that prudence requires.\r\nThe Jesuits did not suffer the whole beach to be searched; they left a\r\npart untouched, from the fear of seeing the breed of tortoises, if not\r\ndestroyed, at least considerably diminished. The whole beach is now\r\ndug up without reserve; and accordingly it seems to be perceived that\r\nthe gathering is less productive from year to year.\r\n\r\nWhen the camp is formed, the missionary of Uruana names his\r\nlieutenant, or commissary, who divides the ground where the eggs are\r\nfound into different portions, according to the number of the Indian\r\ntribes who take part in the gathering. They are all Indians of\r\nMissions, as naked and rude as the Indians of the woods; though they\r\nare called reducidos and neofitos, because they go to church at the\r\nsound of the bell, and have learned to kneel down during the\r\nconsecration of the host.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant (commissionado del Padre) begins his operations by\r\nsounding. He examines by means of a long wooden pole or a cane of\r\nbamboo, how far the stratum of eggs extends. This stratum, according\r\nto our measurements, extended to the distance of one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet from the shore. Its average depth is three feet. The\r\ncommissionado places marks to indicate the point where each tribe\r\nshould stop in its labours. We were surprised to hear this harvest of\r\neggs estimated like the produce of a well-cultivated field. An area\r\naccurately measured of one hundred and twenty feet long, and thirty\r\nfeet wide, has been known to yield one hundred jars of oil, valued at\r\nabout forty pounds sterling. The Indians remove the earth with their\r\nhands; they place the eggs they have collected in small baskets, carry\r\nthem to their encampment, and throw them into long troughs of wood\r\nfilled with water. In these troughs the eggs, broken and stirred with\r\nshovels, remain exposed to the sun till the oily part, which swims on\r\nthe surface, has time to inspissate. As fast as this collects on the\r\nsurface of the water, it is taken off and boiled over a quick fire.\r\nThis animal oil, called tortoise butter (manteca de tortugas* (* The\r\nTamanac Indians give it the name of carapa; the Maypures call it\r\ntimi.)) keeps the better, it is said, in proportion as it has\r\nundergone a strong ebullition. When well prepared, it is limpid,\r\ninodorous, and scarcely yellow. The missionaries compare it to the\r\nbest olive oil, and it is used not merely for burning in lamps, but\r\nfor cooking. It is not easy, however, to procure oil of turtles' eggs\r\nquite pure. It has generally a putrid smell, owing to the mixture of\r\neggs in which the young are already formed.\r\n\r\nI acquired some general statistical notions on the spot, by consulting\r\nthe missionary of Uruana, his lieutenant, and the traders of\r\nAngostura. The shore of Uruana furnishes one thousand botijas, or jars\r\nof oil, annually. The price of each jar at Angostura varies from two\r\npiastres to two and a half. We may admit that the total produce of the\r\nthree shores, where the cosecha, or gathering of eggs, is annually\r\nmade, is five thousand botijas. Now as two hundred eggs yield oil\r\nenough to fill a bottle (limeta), it requires five thousand eggs for a\r\njar or botija of oil. Estimating at one hundred, or one hundred and\r\nsixteen, the number of eggs that one tortoise produces, and reckoning\r\nthat one third of these is broken at the time of laying, particularly\r\nby the mad tortoises, we may presume that, to obtain annually five\r\nthousand jars of oil, three hundred and thirty thousand arrau\r\ntortoises, the weight of which amounts to one hundred and sixty-five\r\nthousand quintals, must lay thirty-three millions of eggs on the three\r\nshores where this harvest is gathered. The results of these\r\ncalculations are much below the truth. Many tortoises lay only sixty\r\nor seventy eggs; and a great number of these animals are devoured by\r\njaguars at the moment they emerge from the water. The Indians bring\r\naway a great number of eggs to eat them dried in the sun; and they\r\nbreak a considerable number through carelessness during the gathering.\r\nThe number of eggs that are hatched before the people can dig them up\r\nis so prodigious, that near the encampment of Uruana I saw the whole\r\nshore of the Orinoco swarming with little tortoises an inch in\r\ndiameter, escaping with difficulty from the pursuit of the Indian\r\nchildren. If to these considerations be added, that all the arraus do\r\nnot assemble on the three shores of the encampments; and that there\r\nare many which lay their eggs in solitude, and some weeks later,*\r\nbetween the mouth of the Orinoco and the confluence of the Apure; we\r\nmust admit that the number of turtles which annually deposit their\r\neggs on the banks of the Lower Orinoco, is near a million. (* The\r\narraus, which lay their eggs before the beginning of March, (for in\r\nthe same species the more or less frequent basking in the sun, the\r\nfood, and the peculiar organization of each individual, occasion\r\ndifferences,) come out of the water with the terekays, which lay in\r\nJanuary and February. Father Gumilla believes them to be arraus that\r\nwere not able to lay their eggs the preceding year. It is difficult to\r\nfind the eggs of the terekays, because these animals, far from\r\ncollecting in thousands on the same beach, deposit their eggs as they\r\nare scattered about.) This number is very great for so large an\r\nanimal. In general large animals multiply less considerably than the\r\nsmaller ones.\r\n\r\nThe labour of collecting the eggs, and preparing the oil, occupies\r\nthree weeks. It is at this period only that the missionaries have any\r\ncommunication with the coast and the civilized neighbouring countries.\r\nThe Franciscan monks who live south of the cataracts, come to the\r\nharvest of eggs less to procure oil, than to see, as they say, white\r\nfaces; and to learn whether the king inhabits the Escurial or San\r\nIldefonso, whether convents are still suppressed in France, and above\r\nall, whether the Turks continue to keep quiet. On these subjects, (the\r\nonly ones interesting to a monk of the Orinoco), the small traders of\r\nAngostura, who visit the encampments, can give, unfortunately, no very\r\nexact information. But in these distant countries no doubt is ever\r\nentertained of the news brought by a white man from the capital. The\r\nprofit of the traders in oil amounts to seventy or eighty per cent;\r\nfor the Indians sell it them at the price of a piastre a jar or\r\nbotija, and the expense of carriage is not more than two-fifths of a\r\npiastre per jar. The Indians bring away also a considerable quantity\r\nof eggs dried in the sun, or slightly boiled. Our rowers had baskets\r\nor little bags of cotton-cloth filled with these eggs. Their taste is\r\nnot disagreeable, when well preserved. We were shown large shells of\r\nturtles, which had been destroyed by the jaguars. These animals follow\r\nthe arraus towards those places on the beach where the eggs are laid.\r\nThey surprise the arraus on the sand; and, in order to devour them at\r\ntheir ease, turn them in such a manner that the under shell is\r\nuppermost. In this situation the turtles cannot rise; and as the\r\njaguar turns many more than he can eat in one night, the Indians often\r\navail themselves of his cunning and avidity.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the difficulty experienced by the naturalist in\r\ngetting out the body of the turtle without separating the upper and\r\nunder shells, we cannot sufficiently wonder at the suppleness of the\r\ntiger's paw, which is able to remove the double armour of the arrau,\r\nas if the adhering parts of the muscles had been cut by a surgical\r\ninstrument. The jaguar pursues the turtle into the water when it is\r\nnot very deep. It even digs up the eggs; and together with the\r\ncrocodile, the heron, and the galinazo vulture, is the most cruel\r\nenemy of the little turtles recently hatched. The island of Pararuma\r\nhad been so much infested with crocodiles the preceding year, during\r\nthe egg-harvest, that the Indians in one night caught eighteen, of\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet long, by means of curved pieces of iron, baited\r\nwith the flesh of the manatee. Besides the beasts of the forests we\r\nhave just named, the wild Indians also very much diminish the quantity\r\nof the oil. Warned by the first slight rains, which they call\r\nturtle-rains (peje canepori* (* In the Tamanac language, from peje, a\r\ntortoise, and canepo, rain.)), they hasten to the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, and kill the turtles with poisoned arrows, whilst, with\r\nupraised heads and paws extended, the animals are warming themselves\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\nThough the little turtles (tortuguillos) may have burst the shells of\r\ntheir eggs during the day, they are never seen to come out of the\r\nground but at night. The Indians assert that the young animal fears\r\nthe heat of the sun. They tried also to show us, that when the\r\ntortuguillo is carried in a bag to a distance from the shore, and\r\nplaced in such a manner that its tail is turned to the river, it takes\r\nwithout hesitation the shortest way to the water. I confess, that this\r\nexperiment, of which Father Gumilla speaks, does not always succeed\r\nequally well: yet in general it does appear that at great distances\r\nfrom the shore, and even in an island, these little animals feel with\r\nextreme delicacy in what direction the most humid air prevails.\r\n\r\nReflecting on the almost uninterrupted layer of eggs that extends\r\nalong the beach, and on the thousands of little turtles that seek the\r\nwater as soon as they are hatched, it is difficult to admit that the\r\nmany turtles which have made their nests in the same spot, can\r\ndistinguish their own young, and lead them, like the crocodiles, to\r\nthe lakes in the vicinity of the Orinoco. It is certain, however, that\r\nthe animal passes the first years of its life in pools where the water\r\nis shallow, and does not return to the bed of the great river till it\r\nis full-grown. How then do the tortuguillos find these pools? Are they\r\nled thither by female turtles, which adopt the young as by chance? The\r\ncrocodiles, less numerous, deposit their eggs in separate holes; and,\r\nin this family of saurians, the female returns about the time when the\r\nincubation is terminated, calls her young, which answer to her voice,\r\nand often assists them to get out of the ground. The arrau tortoise,\r\nno doubt, like the crocodile, knows the spot where she has made her\r\nnest; but, not daring to return to the beach on which the Indians have\r\nformed their encampment, how can she distinguish her own young from\r\nthose which do not belong to her? On the other hand, the Ottomac\r\nIndians declare that, at the period of inundation, they have met with\r\nfemale turtles followed by a great number of young ones. These were\r\nperhaps arraus whose eggs had been deposited on a desert beach to\r\nwhich they could return. Males are extremely rare among these animals.\r\nScarcely is one male found among several hundred females. The cause of\r\nthis disparity cannot be the same as with the crocodiles, which fight\r\nin the coupling season.\r\n\r\nOur pilot had anchored at the Playa de huevos, to purchase some\r\nprovisions, our store having begun to run short. We found there fresh\r\nmeat, Angostura rice, and even biscuit made of wheat-flour. Our\r\nIndians filled the boat with little live turtles, and eggs dried in\r\nthe sun, for their own use. Having taken leave of the missionary of\r\nUruana, who had treated us with great kindness, we set sail about four\r\nin the afternoon. The wind was fresh, and blew in squalls. Since we\r\nhad entered the mountainous part of the country, we had discovered\r\nthat our canoe carried sail very badly; but the master was desirous of\r\nshowing the Indians who were assembled on the beach, that, by going\r\nclose to the wind, he could reach, at one single tack, the middle of\r\nthe river. At the very moment when he was boasting of his dexterity,\r\nand the boldness of his manoeuvre, the force of the wind upon the sail\r\nbecame so great that we were on the point of going down. One side of\r\nthe boat was under water, which rushed in with such violence that it\r\nwas soon up to our knees. It washed over a little table at which I was\r\nwriting at the stern of the boat. I had some difficulty to save my\r\njournal, and in an instant we saw our books, papers, and dried plants,\r\nall afloat. M. Bonpland was lying asleep in the middle of the canoe.\r\nAwakened by the entrance of the water and the cries of the Indians, he\r\nunderstood the danger of our situation, whilst he maintained that\r\ncoolness which he always displayed in the most difficult\r\ncircumstances. The lee-side righting itself from time to time during\r\nthe squall, he did not consider the boat as lost. He thought that,\r\nwere we even forced to abandon it, we might save ourselves by\r\nswimming, since there was no crocodile in sight. Amidst this\r\nuncertainty the cordage of the sail suddenly gave way. The same gust\r\nof wind, that had thrown us on our beam, served also to right us. We\r\nlaboured to bale the water out of the boat with calabashes, the sail\r\nwas again set, and in less than half an hour we were in a state to\r\nproceed. The wind now abated a little. Squalls alternating with dead\r\ncalms are common in that part of the Orinoco which is bordered by\r\nmountains. They are very dangerous for boats deeply laden, and without\r\ndecks. We had escaped as if by miracle. To the reproaches that were\r\nheaped on our pilot for having kept too near the wind, he replied with\r\nthe phlegmatic coolness peculiar to the Indians, observing \"that the\r\nwhites would find sun enough on those banks to dry their papers.\" We\r\nlost only one book--the first volume of the Genera Plantarum of\r\nSchreber--which had fallen overboard. At nightfall we landed on a\r\nbarren island in the middle of the river, near the Mission of Uruana.\r\nWe supped in a clear moonlight, seating ourselves on some large\r\nturtle-shells that were found scattered about the beach. What\r\nsatisfaction we felt on finding ourselves thus comfortably landed! We\r\nfigured to ourselves the situation of a man who had been saved alone\r\nfrom shipwreck, wandering on these desert shores, meeting at every\r\nstep with other rivers which fall into the Orinoco, and which it is\r\ndangerous to pass by swimming, on account of the multitude of\r\ncrocodiles and caribe fishes. We pictured to ourselves such a man,\r\nalive to the most tender affections of the soul, ignorant of the fate\r\nof his companions, and thinking more of them than of himself. If we\r\nlove to indulge such melancholy meditations, it is because, when just\r\nescaped from danger, we seem to feel as it were the necessity of\r\nstrong emotions. Our minds were full of what we had just witnessed.\r\nThere are periods in life when, without being discouraged, the future\r\nappears more uncertain. It was only three days since we had entered\r\nthe Orinoco, and there yet remained three months for us to navigate\r\nrivers encumbered with rocks, and in boats smaller than that in which\r\nwe had so nearly perished.\r\n\r\nThe night was intensely hot. We lay upon skins spread on the ground,\r\nthere being no trees to which we could fasten our hammocks. The\r\ntorments of the mosquitos increased every day; and we were surprised\r\nto find that on this spot our fires did not prevent the approach of\r\nthe jaguars. They swam across the arm of the river that separated us\r\nfrom the mainland. Towards morning we heard their cries very near.\r\nThey had come to the island where we passed the night. The Indians\r\ntold us that, during the collecting of the turtles' eggs, tigers are\r\nalways more frequent in those regions, and display at that period the\r\ngreatest intrepidity.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 7th, we passed, on our right, the mouth of\r\nthe great Rio Arauca, celebrated for the immense number of birds that\r\nfrequent it; and, on our left, the Mission of Uruana, commonly called\r\nLa Concepcion de Urbana. This small village, which contains five\r\nhundred souls, was founded by the Jesuits, about the year 1748, by the\r\nunion of the Ottomac and Cavere Indians. It lies at the foot of a\r\nmountain composed of detached blocks of granite, which, I believe,\r\nbears the name of Saraguaca. Masses of rock, separated one from the\r\nother by the effect of decomposition, form caverns, in which we find\r\nindubitable proofs of the ancient civilization of the natives.\r\nHieroglyphic figures, and even characters in regular lines, are seen\r\nsculptured on their sides; though I doubt whether they bear any\r\nanalogy to alphabetic writing. We visited the Mission of Uruana on our\r\nreturn from the Rio Negro, and saw with our own eyes those heaps of\r\nearth which the Ottomacs eat, and which have become the subject of\r\nsuch lively discussion in Europe.* (* This earth is a greasy kind of\r\nclay, which, in seasons of scarcity, the natives use to assuage the\r\ncravings of hunger; it having been proved by their experience as well\r\nas by physiological researches, that want of food can be more easily\r\nborne by filling the cavity of the stomach with some substance, even\r\nalthough it may be in itself very nearly or totally innutritious. The\r\nIndian hunters of North America, for the same purpose, tie boards\r\ntightly across the abdomen; and most savage races are found to have\r\nrecourse to expedients that answer the same end.)\r\n\r\nOn measuring the breadth of the Orinoco between the islands called\r\nIsla de Uruana and Isla de la Manteca, we found it, during the high\r\nwaters, 2674 toises, which make nearly four nautical miles. This is\r\neight times the breadth of the Nile at Manfalout and Syout, yet we\r\nwere at the distance of a hundred and ninety-four leagues from the\r\nmouth of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the water at its surface was 27.8 degrees of the\r\ncentigrade thermometer, near Uruana. That of the river Zaire, or\r\nCongo, in Africa, at an equal distance from the equator, was found by\r\nCaptain Tuckey, in the months of July and August, to be only from 23.9\r\nto 25.6 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe western bank of the Orinoco remains low farther than the mouth of\r\nthe Meta; while from the Mission of Uruana the mountains approach the\r\neastern bank more and more. As the strength of the current increases\r\nin proportion as the river grows narrower, the progress of our boat\r\nbecame much slower. We continued to ascend the Orinoco under sail, but\r\nthe high and woody grounds deprived us of the wind. At other times the\r\nnarrow passes between the mountains by which we sailed, sent us\r\nviolent gusts, but of short duration. The number of crocodiles\r\nincreased below the junction of the Rio Arauca, particularly opposite\r\nthe great lake of Capanaparo, which communicates with the Orinoco, as\r\nthe Laguna de Cabullarito communicates at the same time with the\r\nOrinoco and the Rio Arauca. The Indians told us that the crocodiles\r\ncame from the inlands, where they had been buried in the dried mud of\r\nthe savannahs. As soon as the first showers arouse them from their\r\nlethargy, they crowd together in troops, and hasten toward the river,\r\nthere to disperse again. Here, in the equinoctial zone, it is the\r\nincrease of humidity that recalls them to life; while in Georgia and\r\nFlorida, in the temperate zone, it is the augmentation of heat that\r\nrouses these animals from a state of nervous and muscular debility,\r\nduring which the active powers of respiration are suspended or\r\nsingularly diminished. The season of great drought, improperly called\r\nthe summer of the torrid zone, corresponds with the winter of the\r\ntemperate zone; and it is a curious physiological phenomenon to\r\nobserve the alligators of North America plunged into a winter-sleep by\r\nexcess of cold, at the same period when the crocodiles of the Llanos\r\nbegin their siesta or summer-sleep. If it were probable that these\r\nanimals of the same family had heretofore inhabited the same northern\r\ncountry, we might suppose that, in advancing towards the equator, they\r\nfeel the want of repose after having exercised their muscles for seven\r\nor eight months, and that they retain under a new sky the habits which\r\nappear to be essentially linked with their organization.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the mouths of the channels communicating with the lake\r\nof Capanaparo, we entered a part of the Orinoco, where the bed of the\r\nriver is narrowed by the mountains of Baraguan. It is a kind of\r\nstrait, reaching nearly to the confluence of the Rio Suapure. From\r\nthese granite mountains the natives heretofore gave the name of\r\nBaraguan to that part of the Orinoco comprised between the mouths of\r\nthe Arauca and the Atabapo. Among savage nations great rivers bear\r\ndifferent denominations in the different portions of their course. The\r\nPassage of Baraguan presents a picturesque scene. The granite rocks\r\nare perpendicular. They form a range of mountains lying north-west and\r\nsouth-east; and the river cutting this dyke nearly at a right angle,\r\nthe summits of the mountains appear like separate peaks. Their\r\nelevation in general does not surpass one hundred and twenty toises;\r\nbut their situation in the midst of a small plain, their steep\r\ndeclivities, and their flanks destitute of vegetation, give them a\r\nmajestic character. They are composed of enormous masses of granite of\r\na parallelopipedal figure, but rounded at the edges, and heaped one\r\nupon another. The blocks are often eighty feet long, and twenty or\r\nthirty broad. They would seem to have been piled up by some external\r\nforce, if the proximity of a rock identical in its composition, not\r\nseparated into blocks but filled with veins, did not prove that the\r\nparallelopipedal form is owing solely to the action of the atmosphere.\r\nThese veins, two or three inches thick, are distinguished by a\r\nfine-grained quartz-granite crossing a coarse-grained granite almost\r\nporphyritic, and abounding in fine crystals of red feldspar. I sought\r\nin vain, in the Cordillera of Baraguan, for hornblende, and those\r\nsteatitic masses that characterise several granites of the Higher Alps\r\nin Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWe landed in the middle of the strait of Baraguan to measure its\r\nbreadth. The rocks project so much towards the river that I measured\r\nwith difficulty a base of eighty toises. I found the river eight\r\nhundred and eighty-nine toises broad. In order to conceive how this\r\npassage bears the name of a strait, we must recollect that the breadth\r\nof the river from Uruana to the junction of the Meta is in general\r\nfrom 1500 to 2500 toises. In this place, which is extremely hot and\r\nbarren, I measured two granite summits, much rounded: one was only a\r\nhundred and ten, and the other eighty-five, toises. There are higher\r\nsummits in the interior of the group, but in general these mountains,\r\nof so wild an aspect, have not the elevation that is assigned to them\r\nby the missionaries.\r\n\r\nWe looked in vain for plants in the clefts of the rocks, which are as\r\nsteep as walls, and furnish some traces of stratification. We found\r\nonly an old trunk of aubletia* (* Aubletia tiburba.), with large\r\napple-shaped fruit, and a new species of the family of the apocyneae.*\r\n(* Allamanda salicifolia.) All the stones were covered with an\r\ninnumerable quantity of iguanas and geckos with spreading and\r\nmembranous fingers. These lizards, motionless, with heads raised, and\r\nmouths open, seemed to suck in the heated air. The thermometer placed\r\nagainst the rock rose to 50.2 degrees. The soil appeared to undulate,\r\nfrom the effect of mirage, without a breath of wind being felt. The\r\nsun was near the zenith, and its dazzling light, reflected from the\r\nsurface of the river, contrasted with the reddish vapours that\r\nenveloped every surrounding object. How vivid is the impression\r\nproduced by the calm of nature, at noon, in these burning climates!\r\nThe beasts of the forests retire to the thickets; the birds hide\r\nthemselves beneath the foliage of the trees, or in the crevices of the\r\nrocks. Yet, amidst this apparent silence, when we lend an attentive\r\near to the most feeble sounds transmitted through the air, we hear a\r\ndull vibration, a continual murmur, a hum of insects, filling, if we\r\nmay use the expression, all the lower strata of the air. Nothing is\r\nbetter fitted to make man feel the extent and power of organic life.\r\nMyriads of insects creep upon the soil, and flutter round the plants\r\nparched by the heat of the sun. A confused noise issues from every\r\nbush, from the decayed trunks of trees, from the clefts of the rocks,\r\nand from the ground undermined by lizards, millepedes, and cecilias.\r\nThese are so many voices proclaiming to us that all nature breathes;\r\nand that, under a thousand different forms, life is diffused\r\nthroughout the cracked and dusty soil, as well as in the bosom of the\r\nwaters, and in the air that circulates around us.\r\n\r\nThe sensations which I here recall to mind are not unknown to those\r\nwho, without having advanced to the equator, have visited Italy,\r\nSpain, or Egypt. That contrast of motion and silence, that aspect of\r\nnature at once calm and animated, strikes the imagination of the\r\ntraveller when he enters the basin of the Mediterranean, within the\r\nzone of olives, dwarf palms, and date-trees.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night on the eastern bank of the Orinoco, at the foot of\r\na granitic hill. Near this desert spot was formerly seated the Mission\r\nof San Regis. We could have wished to find a spring in the Baraguan,\r\nfor the water of the river had a smell of musk, and a sweetish taste\r\nextremely disagreeable. In the Orinoco, as well as in the Apure, we\r\nare struck with the difference observable in the various parts of the\r\nriver near the most barren shore. The water is sometimes very\r\ndrinkable, and sometimes seems to be loaded with a slimy matter. \"It\r\nis the bark (meaning the coriaceous covering) of the putrefied cayman\r\nthat is the cause,\" say the natives. \"The more aged the cayman, the\r\nmore bitter is his bark.\" I have no doubt that the carcasses of these\r\nlarge reptiles, those of the manatees, which weigh five hundred\r\npounds, and the presence of the porpoises (toninas) with their\r\nmucilaginous skin, may contaminate the water, especially in the\r\ncreeks, where the river has little velocity. Yet the spots where we\r\nfound the most fetid water, were not always those where dead animals\r\nwere accumulated on the beach. When, in such burning climates, where\r\nwe are constantly tormented by thirst, we are reduced to drink the\r\nwater of a river at the temperature of 27 or 28 degrees, we cannot\r\nhelp wishing at least that water so hot, and so loaded with sand,\r\nshould be free from smell.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April we passed the mouths of the Suapure or Sivapuri,\r\nand the Caripo, on the east, and the outlet of the Sinaruco on the\r\nwest. This last river is, next to the Rio Arauca, the most\r\nconsiderable between the Apure and the Meta. The Suapure, full of\r\nlittle cascades, is celebrated among the Indians for the quantity of\r\nwild honey obtained from the forests in its neighbourhood. The\r\nmelipones there suspend their enormous hives to the branches of trees.\r\nFather Gili, in 1766, made an excursion on the Suapure, and on the\r\nTuriva, which falls into it. He there found tribes of the nation of\r\nAreverians. We passed the night a little below the island Macapina.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning we arrived at the beach of Pararuma,\r\nwhere we found an encampment of Indians similar to that we had seen at\r\nthe Boca de la Tortuga. They had assembled to search the sands, for\r\ncollecting the turtles' eggs, and extracting the oil; but they had\r\nunfortunately made a mistake of several days. The young turtles had\r\ncome out of their shells before the Indians had formed their camp; and\r\nconsequently the crocodiles and the garzes, a species of large white\r\nherons, availed themselves of the delay. These animals, alike fond of\r\nthe flesh of the young turtles, devour an innumerable quantity. They\r\nfish during the night, for the tortuguillos do not come out of the\r\nearth to gain the neighbouring river till after the evening twilight.\r\nThe zamuro vultures are too indolent to hunt after sunset. They stalk\r\nalong the shores in the daytime, and alight in the midst of the Indian\r\nencampment to steal provisions; but they often find no other means of\r\nsatisfying their voracity than by attacking young crocodiles of seven\r\nor eight inches long, either on land or in water of little depth. It\r\nis curious to see the address with which these little animals defend\r\nthemselves for a time against the vultures. As soon as they perceive\r\nthe enemy, they raise themselves on their fore paws, bend their backs,\r\nand lift up their heads, opening their wide jaws. They turn\r\ncontinually, though slowly, toward their assailant to show him their\r\nteeth, which, even when the animal has but recently issued from the\r\negg, are very long and sharp. Often while the attention of a young\r\ncrocodile is wholly engaged by one of the zamuros, another seizes the\r\nfavourable opportunity for an unforeseen attack. He pounces on the\r\ncrocodile, grasps him by the neck, and bears him off to the higher\r\nregions of the air. We had an opportunity of observing this manoeuvre\r\nduring several mornings, at Mompex, on the banks of the Magdalena,\r\nwhere we had collected more than forty very young crocodiles, in a\r\nspacious court surrounded by a wall.\r\n\r\nWe found among the Indians assembled at Pararuma some white men, who\r\nhad come from Angostura to purchase the tortoise-butter. After having\r\nwearied us for a long time with their complaints of the bad harvest,\r\nand the mischief done by the tigers among the turtles, at the time of\r\nlaying their eggs, they conducted us beneath an ajoupa, that rose in\r\nthe centre of the Indian camp. We here found the missionary-monks of\r\nCarichana and the Cataracts seated on the ground, playing at cards,\r\nand smoking tobacco in long pipes. Their ample blue garments, their\r\nshaven heads, and their long beards, might have led us to mistake them\r\nfor natives of the East. These poor priests received us in the kindest\r\nmanner, giving us every information necessary for the continuation of\r\nour voyage. They had suffered from tertian fever for some months; and\r\ntheir pale and emaciated aspect easily convinced us that the countries\r\nwe were about to visit were not without danger to the health of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThe Indian pilot, who had brought us from San Fernando de Apure as far\r\nas the shore of Pararuma, was unacquainted with the passage of the\r\nrapids* (* Little cascades, chorros raudalitos.) of the Orinoco, and\r\nwould not undertake to conduct our bark any farther. We were obliged\r\nto conform to his will. Happily for us, the missionary of Carichana\r\nconsented to sell us a fine canoe at a very moderate price: and Father\r\nBernardo Zea, missionary of the Atures and Maypures near the great\r\ncataracts, offered, though still unwell, to accompany us as far as the\r\nfrontiers of Brazil. The number of natives who can assist in guiding\r\nboats through the Raudales is so inconsiderable that, but for the\r\npresence of the monk, we should have risked spending whole weeks in\r\nthese humid and unhealthy regions. On the banks of the Orinoco, the\r\nforests of the Rio Negro are considered as delicious spots. The air is\r\nindeed cooler and more healthful. The river is free from crocodiles;\r\none may bathe without apprehension, and by night as well as by day\r\nthere is less torment from the sting of insects than on the Orinoco.\r\nFather Zea hoped to reestablish his health by visiting the Missions of\r\nRio Negro. He talked of those places with that enthusiasm which is\r\nfelt in all the colonies of South America for everything far off.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of Indians at Pararuma again excited in us that\r\ninterest, which everywhere attaches man in a cultivated state to the\r\nstudy of man in a savage condition, and the successive development of\r\nhis intellectual faculties. How difficult to recognize in this infancy\r\nof society, in this assemblage of dull, silent, inanimate Indians, the\r\nprimitive character of our species! Human nature does not here\r\nmanifest those features of artless simplicity, of which poets in every\r\nlanguage have drawn such enchanting pictures. The savage of the\r\nOrinoco appeared to us to be as hideous as the savage of the\r\nMississippi, described by that philosophical traveller Volney, who so\r\nwell knew how to paint man in different climates. We are eager to\r\npersuade ourselves that these natives, crouching before the fire, or\r\nseated on large turtle-shells, their bodies covered with earth and\r\ngrease, their eyes stupidly fixed for whole hours on the beverage they\r\nare preparing, far from being the primitive type of our species, are a\r\ndegenerate race, the feeble remains of nations who, after having been\r\nlong dispersed in the forests, are replunged into barbarism.\r\n\r\nRed paint being in some sort the only clothing of the Indians, two\r\nkinds may be distinguished among them, according as they are more or\r\nless affluent. The common decoration of the Caribs, the Ottomacs, and\r\nthe Jaruros, is onoto,* (* Properly anoto. This word belongs to the\r\nTamanac Indians. The Maypures call it majepa. The Spanish missionaries\r\nsay onotarse, to rub the skin with anato.) called by the Spaniards\r\nachote, and by the planters of Cayenne, rocou. It is the colouring\r\nmatter extracted from the pulp of the Bixa orellana.* (* The word\r\nbixa, adopted by botanists, is derived from the ancient language of\r\nHaiti (the island of St. Domingo). Rocou, the term commonly used by\r\nthe French, is derived from the Brazilian word, urucu.) The Indian\r\nwomen prepare the anato by throwing the seeds of the plant into a tub\r\nfilled with water. They beat this water for an hour, and then leave it\r\nto deposit the colouring fecula, which is of an intense brick-red.\r\nAfter having separated the water, they take out the fecula, dry it\r\nbetween their hands, knead it with oil of turtles' eggs, and form it\r\ninto round cakes of three or four ounces weight. When turtle oil is\r\nwanting, some tribes mix with the anato the fat of the crocodile.\r\n\r\nAnother pigment, much more valuable, is extracted from a plant of the\r\nfamily of the bignoniae, which M. Bonpland has made known by the name\r\nof Bignonia chica. It climbs up and clings to the tallest trees by the\r\naid of tendrils. Its bilabiate flowers are an inch long, of a fine\r\nviolet colour, and disposed by twos or threes. The bipinnate leaves\r\nbecome reddish in drying. The fruit is a pod, filled with winged\r\nseeds, and is two feet long. This plant grows spontaneously, and in\r\ngreat abundance, near Maypures; and in going up the Orinoco, beyond\r\nthe mouth of the Guaviare, from Santa Barbara to the lofty mountain of\r\nDuida, particularly near Esmeralda. We also found it on the banks of\r\nthe Cassiquiare. The red pigment of chica is not obtained from the\r\nfruit, like the onoto, but from the leaves macerated in water. The\r\ncolouring matter separates in the form of a light powder. It is\r\ncollected, without being mixed with turtle-oil, into little lumps\r\neight or nine inches long, and from two to three high, rounded at the\r\nedges. These lumps, when heated, emit an agreeable smell of benzoin.\r\nWhen the chica is subjected to distillation, it yields no sensible\r\ntraces of ammonia. It is not, like indigo, a substance combined with\r\nazote. It dissolves slightly in sulphuric and muriatic acids, and even\r\nin alkalis. Ground with oil, the chica furnishes a red colour that has\r\na tint of lake. Applied to wool, it might be confounded with\r\nmadder-red. There is no doubt but that the chica, unknown in Europe\r\nbefore our travels, may be employed usefully in the arts. The nations\r\non the Orinoco, by whom this pigment is best prepared, are the\r\nSalivas, the Guipunaves,* (* Or Guaypunaves; they call themselves\r\nUipunavi.) the Caveres, and the Piraoas. The processes of infusion and\r\nmaceration are in general very common among all the nations on the\r\nOrinoco. Thus the Maypures carry on a trade of barter with the little\r\nloaves of puruma, which is a vegetable fecula, dried in the manner of\r\nindigo, and yielding a very permanent yellow colour. The chemistry of\r\nthe savage is reduced to the preparation of pigments, that of poisons,\r\nand the dulcification of the amylaceous roots, which the aroides and\r\nthe euphorbiaceous plants afford.\r\n\r\nMost of the missionaries of the Upper and Lower Orinoco permit the\r\nIndians of their Missions to paint their skins. It is painful to add,\r\nthat some of them speculate on this barbarous practice of the natives.\r\nIn their huts, pompously called conventos,* (* In the Missions, the\r\npriest's house bears the name of the convent.) I have often seen\r\nstores of chica, which they sold as high as four francs the cake. To\r\nform a just idea of the extravagance of the decoration of these naked\r\nIndians, I must observe, that a man of large stature gains with\r\ndifficulty enough by the labour of a fortnight, to procure in exchange\r\nthe chica necessary to paint himself red. Thus as we say, in temperate\r\nclimates, of a poor man, \"he has not enough to clothe himself,\" you\r\nhear the Indians of the Orinoco say, \"that man is so poor, that he has\r\nnot enough to paint half his body.\" The little trade in chica is\r\ncarried on chiefly with the tribes of the Lower Orinoco, whose country\r\ndoes not produce the plant which furnishes this much-valued substance.\r\nThe Caribs and the Ottomacs paint only the head and the hair with\r\nchica, but the Salives possess this pigment in sufficient abundance to\r\ncover their whole bodies. When the missionaries send on their own\r\naccount small cargoes of cacao, tobacco, and chiquichiqui* (* Ropes\r\nmade with the petioles of a palm-tree with pinnate leaves.) from the\r\nRio Negro to Angostura, they always add some cakes of chica, as being\r\narticles of merchandise in great request.\r\n\r\nThe custom of painting is not equally ancient among all the tribes of\r\nthe Orinoco. It has increased since the time when the powerful nation\r\nof the Caribs made frequent incursions into those countries. The\r\nvictors and the vanquished were alike naked; and to please the\r\nconqueror it was necessary to paint like him, and to assume his\r\ncolour. The influence of the Caribs has now ceased, and they remain\r\ncircumscribed between the rivers Carony, Cuyuni, and Paraguamuzi; but\r\nthe Caribbean fashion of painting the whole body is still preserved.\r\nThe custom has survived the conquest.\r\n\r\nDoes the use of the anato and chica derive its origin from the desire\r\nof pleasing, and the taste for ornament, so common among the most\r\nsavage nations? or must we suppose it to be founded on the\r\nobservation, that these colouring and oily matters with which the skin\r\nis plastered, preserve it from the sting of the mosquitos? I have\r\noften heard this question discussed in Europe; but in the Missions of\r\nthe Orinoco, and wherever, within the tropics, the air is filled with\r\nvenomous insects, the inquiry would appear absurd. The Carib and the\r\nSalive, who are painted red, are not less cruelly tormented by the\r\nmosquitos and the zancudos, than the Indians whose bodies are\r\nplastered with no colour. The sting of the insect causes no swelling\r\nin either; and scarcely ever produces those little pustules which\r\noccasion such smarting and itching to Europeans recently arrived. But\r\nthe native and the White suffer equally from the sting, till the\r\ninsect has withdrawn its sucker from the skin. After a thousand\r\nuseless essays, M. Bonpland and myself tried the expedient of rubbing\r\nour hands and arms with the fat of the crocodile, and the oil of\r\nturtle-eggs, but we never felt the least relief, and were stung as\r\nbefore. I know that the Laplanders boast of oil and fat as the most\r\nuseful preservatives; but the insects of Scandinavia are not of the\r\nsame species as those of the Orinoco. The smoke of tobacco drives away\r\nour gnats, while it is employed in vain against the zancudos. If the\r\napplication of fat and astringent* substances preserved the\r\ninhabitants of these countries from the torment of insects, as Father\r\nGumilla alleges, why has not the custom of painting the skin become\r\ngeneral on these shores? (* The pulp of the anato, and even the chica,\r\nare astringent and slightly purgative.) Why do so many naked natives\r\npaint only the face, though living in the neighbourhood of those who\r\npaint the whole body?* (* The Caribs, the Salives, the Tamanacs, and\r\nthe Maypures.)\r\n\r\nWe are struck with the observation, that the Indians of the Orinoco,\r\nlike the natives of North America, prefer the substances that yield a\r\nred colour to every other. Is this predilection founded on the\r\nfacility with which the savage procures ochreous earths, or the\r\ncolouring fecula of anato and of chica? I doubt this much. Indigo\r\ngrows wild in a great part of equinoctial America. This plant, like so\r\nmany other leguminous plants, would have furnished the natives\r\nabundantly with pigments to colour themselves blue like the ancient\r\nBritons.* (* The half-clad nations of the temperate zone often paint\r\ntheir skin of the same colour as that with which their clothes are\r\ndyed.) Yet we see no American tribe painted with indigo. It appears to\r\nme probable, as I have already hinted above, that the preference given\r\nby the Americans to the red colour is generally founded on the\r\ntendency which nations feel to attribute the idea of beauty to\r\nwhatever characterises their national physiognomy. Men whose skin is\r\nnaturally of a brownish red, love a red colour. If they be born with a\r\nforehead little raised, and the head flat, they endeavour to depress\r\nthe foreheads of their children. If they be distinguished from other\r\nnations by a thin beard, they try to eradicate the few hairs that\r\nnature has given them. They think themselves embellished in proportion\r\nas they heighten the characteristic marks of their race, or of their\r\nnational conformation.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised to see, that, in the camp of Pararuma, the women far\r\nadvanced in years were more occupied with their ornaments than the\r\nyoungest women. We saw an Indian female of the nation of the Ottomacs\r\nemploying two of her daughters in the operation of rubbing her hair\r\nwith the oil of turtles' eggs, and painting her back with anato and\r\ncaruto. The ornament consisted of a sort of lattice-work formed of\r\nblack lines crossing each other on a red ground. Each little square\r\nhad a black dot in the centre. It was a work of incredible patience.\r\nWe returned from a very long herborization, and the painting was not\r\nhalf finished. This research of ornament seems the more singular when\r\nwe reflect that the figures and marks are not produced by the process\r\nof tattooing, but that paintings executed with so much care are\r\neffaced,* if the Indian exposes himself imprudently to a heavy shower.\r\n(* The black and caustic pigment of the caruto (Genipa americana)\r\nhowever, resists a long time the action of water, as we found with\r\nregret, having one day, in sport with the Indians, caused our faces to\r\nbe marked with spots and strokes of caruto. When we returned to\r\nAngostura, in the midst of Europeans, these marks were still visible.)\r\nThere are some nations who paint only to celebrate festivals; others\r\nare covered with colour during the whole year: and the latter consider\r\nthe use of anato as so indispensable, that both men and women would\r\nperhaps be less ashamed to present themselves without a guayaco* than\r\ndestitute of paint. (* A word of the Caribbean language. The perizoma\r\nof the Indians of the Orinoco is rather a band than an apron.) These\r\nguayucos of the Orinoco are partly bark of trees, and partly\r\ncotton-cloth. Those of the men are broader than those worn by the\r\nwomen, who, the missionaries say, have in general a less lively\r\nfeeling of modesty. A similar observation was made by Christopher\r\nColumbus. May we not attribute this in difference, this want of\r\ndelicacy in women belonging to nations of which the manners are not\r\nmuch depraved, to that rude state of slavery to which the sex is\r\nreduced in South America by male injustice and tyranny?\r\n\r\nWhen we speak in Europe of a native of Guiana, we figure to ourselves\r\na man whose head and waist are decorated with the fine feathers of the\r\nmacaw, the toucan, and the humming-bird. Our painters and sculptors\r\nhave long since regarded these ornaments as the characteristic marks\r\nof an American. We were surprised at not finding in the Chayma\r\nMissions, in the encampments of Uruana and of Pararuma (I might almost\r\nsay on all the shores of the Orinoco and the Cassiquiare) those fine\r\nplumes, those feathered aprons, which are so often brought by\r\ntravellers from Cayenne and Demerara. These tribes for the most part,\r\neven those whose intellectual faculties are most expanded, who\r\ncultivate alimentary plants, and know how to weave cotton, are\r\naltogether as naked,* as poor, and as destitute of ornaments as the\r\nnatives of New Holland. (* For instance, the Macos and the Piraoas.\r\nThe Caribs must be excepted, whose perizoma is a cotton cloth, so\r\nbroad that it might cover the shoulders.) The excessive heat of the\r\nair, the profuse perspiration in which the body is bathed at every\r\nhour of the day and a great part of the night, render the use of\r\nclothes insupportable. Their objects of ornament, and particularly\r\ntheir plumes of feathers, are reserved for dances and solemn\r\nfestivals. The plumes worn by the Guipunaves* are the most celebrated;\r\nbeing composed of the fine feathers of manakins and parrots. (* These\r\ncame originally from the banks of the Inirida, one of the rivers that\r\nfall into the Guaviare.)\r\n\r\nThe Indians are not always satisfied with one colour uniformly spread;\r\nthey sometimes imitate, in the most whimsical manner, in painting\r\ntheir skin, the form of European garments. We saw some at Pararuma,\r\nwho were painted with blue jackets and black buttons. The missionaries\r\nrelated to us that the Guaynaves of the Rio Caura are accustomed to\r\nstain themselves red with anato, and to make broad transverse stripes\r\non the body, on which they stick spangles of silvery mica. Seen at a\r\ndistance, these naked men appear to be dressed in laced clothes. If\r\npainted nations had been examined with the same attention as those who\r\nare clothed, it would have been perceived that the most fertile\r\nimagination, and the most mutable caprice, have created the fashions\r\nof painting, as well as those of garments.\r\n\r\nPainting and tattooing are not restrained, in either the New or the\r\nOld World, to one race or one zone only. These ornaments are most\r\ncommon among the Malays and American races; but in the time of the\r\nRomans they were also employed by the white race in the north of\r\nEurope. As the most picturesque garments and modes of dress are found\r\nin the Grecian Archipelago and western Asia, so the type of beauty in\r\npainting and tattooing is displayed by the islanders of the Pacific.\r\nSome clothed nations still paint their hands, their nails, and their\r\nfaces. It would seem that painting is then confined to those parts of\r\nthe body that remain uncovered; and while rouge, which recalls to mind\r\nthe savage state of man, is disappearing by degrees in Europe, in some\r\ntowns of the province of Peru the ladies think they embellish their\r\ndelicate skins by covering them with colouring vegetable matter,\r\nstarch, white-of-egg, and flour. After having lived a long time among\r\nmen painted with anato and chica, we are singularly struck with these\r\nremains of ancient barbarism retained amidst all the usages of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe encampment at Pararuma afforded us an opportunity of examining\r\nseveral animals in their natural state, which, till then, we had seen\r\nonly in the collections of Europe. These little animals form a branch\r\nof commerce for the missionaries. They exchange tobacco, the resin\r\ncalled mani, the pigment of chica, gallitos (rock-manakins), orange\r\nmonkeys, capuchin monkeys, and other species of monkeys in great\r\nrequest on the coast, for cloth, nails, hatchets, fishhooks, and pins.\r\nThe productions of the Orinoco are bought at a low price from the\r\nIndians, who live in dependence on the monks; and these same Indians\r\npurchase fishing and gardening implements from the monks at a very\r\nhigh price, with the money they have gained at the egg-harvest. We\r\nourselves bought several animals, which we kept with us throughout the\r\nrest of our passage on the river, and studied their manners.\r\n\r\nThe gallitos, or rock-manakins, are sold at Pararuma in pretty little\r\ncages made of the footstalks of palm-leaves. These birds are\r\ninfinitely more rare on the banks of the Orinoco, and in the north and\r\nwest of equinoctial America, than in French Guiana. They have hitherto\r\nbeen found only near the Mission of Encaramada, and in the Raudales or\r\ncataracts of Maypures. I say expressly IN the cataracts, because the\r\ngallitos choose for their habitual dwelling the hollows of the little\r\ngranitic rocks that cross the Orinoco and form such numerous cascades.\r\nWe sometimes saw them appear in the morning in the midst of the foam\r\nof the river, calling their females, and fighting in the manner of our\r\ncocks, folding the double moveable crest that decorates the crown of\r\nthe head. As the Indians very rarely take the full-grown gallitos, and\r\nthose males only are valued in Europe, which from the third year have\r\nbeautiful saffron-coloured plumage, purchasers should be on their\r\nguard not to confound young females with young males. Both the male\r\nand female gallitos are of an olive-brown; but the pollo, or young\r\nmale, is distinguishable at the earliest age, by its size and its\r\nyellow feet. After the third year the plumage of the males assumes a\r\nbeautiful saffron tint; but the female remains always of a dull dusky\r\nbrown colour, with yellow only on the wing-coverts and tips of the\r\nwings.* (* Especially the part which ornithologists call the carpus.)\r\nTo preserve in our collections the fine tint of the plumage of a male\r\nand full-grown rock-manakin, it must not be exposed to the light. This\r\ntint grows pale more easy than in the other genera of the passerine\r\norder. The young males, as in most other birds, have the plumage or\r\nlivery of their mother. I am surprised to see that so skilful a\r\nnaturalist as Le Vaillant can doubt whether the females always remain\r\nof a dusky olive tint.* (* Oiseaux de Paradis volume 2 page 61.) The\r\nIndians of the Raudales all assured me that they had never seen a\r\nsaffron-coloured female.\r\n\r\nAmong the monkeys, brought by the Indians to the fair of Pararuma, we\r\ndistinguished several varieties of the sai,* (* Simia capucina the\r\ncapuchin monkey.) belonging to the little groups of creeping monkeys\r\ncalled matchi in the Spanish colonies; marimondes* (* Simia\r\nbelzebuth.), or ateles with a red belly; titis, and viuditas. The last\r\ntwo species particularly attracted our attention, and we purchased\r\nthem to send to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe titi of the Orinoco (Simia sciurea), well-known in our\r\ncollections, is called bititeni by the Maypure Indians. It is very\r\ncommon on the south of the cataracts. Its face is white; and a little\r\nspot of bluish-black covers the mouth and the point of the nose. The\r\ntitis of the most elegant form, and the most beautiful colour (with\r\nhair of a golden yellow), come from the banks of the Cassiquiare.\r\nThose that are taken on the shores of the Guaviare are large and\r\ndifficult to tame. No other monkey has so much the physiognomy of a\r\nchild as the titi; there is the same expression of innocence, the same\r\nplayful smile, the same rapidity in the transition from joy to sorrow.\r\nIts large eyes are instantly filled with tears, when it is seized with\r\nfear. It is extremely fond of insects, particularly of spiders. The\r\nsagacity of this little animal is so great, that one of those we\r\nbrought in our boat to Angostura distinguished perfectly the different\r\nplates annexed to Cuvier's Tableau elementaire d'Histoire naturelle.\r\nThe engravings of this work are not coloured; yet the titi advanced\r\nrapidly its little hand in the hope of catching a grasshopper or a\r\nwasp, every time that we showed it the eleventh plate, on which these\r\ninsects are represented. It remained perfectly indifferent when it was\r\nshown engravings of skeletons or heads of mammiferous animals.* (* I\r\nmay observe, that I have never heard of an instance in which a\r\npicture, representing, in the greatest perfection, hares or deer of\r\ntheir natural size, has made the least impression even on sporting\r\ndogs, the intelligence of which appears the most improved. Is there\r\nany authenticated instance of a dog having recognized a full length\r\npicture of his master? In all these cases, the sight is not assisted\r\nby the smell.) When several of these little monkeys, shut up in the\r\nsame cage, are exposed to the rain, and the habitual temperature of\r\nthe air sinks suddenly two or three degrees, they twist their tail\r\n(which, however, is not prehensile) round their neck, and intertwine\r\ntheir arms and legs to warm one another. The Indian hunters told us,\r\nthat in the forests they often met groups of ten or twelve of these\r\nanimals, whilst others sent forth lamentable cries, because they\r\nwished to enter amid the group to find warmth and shelter. By shooting\r\narrows dipped in weak poison at one of these groups, a great number of\r\nyoung monkeys are taken alive at once. The titi in falling remains\r\nclinging to its mother, and if it be not wounded by the fall, it does\r\nnot quit the shoulder or the neck of the dead animal. Most of those\r\nthat are found alive in the huts of the Indians have been thus taken\r\nfrom the dead bodies of their mothers. Those that are full grown, when\r\ncured of a slight wound, commonly die before they can accustom\r\nthemselves to a domestic state. The titis are in general delicate and\r\ntimid little animals. It is very difficult to convey them from the\r\nMissions of the Orinoco to the coast of Caracas, or of Cumana. They\r\nbecome melancholy and dejected in proportion as they quit the region\r\nof the forests, and enter the Llanos. This change cannot be attributed\r\nto the slight elevation of the temperature; it seems rather to depend\r\non a greater intensity of light, a less degree of humidity, and some\r\nchemical property of the air of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe saimiri, or titi of the Orinoco, the atele, the sajou, and other\r\nquadrumanous animals long known in Europe, form a striking contrast,\r\nboth in their gait and habits, with the macavahu, called by the\r\nmissionaries viudita, or widow in mourning. The hair of this little\r\nanimal is soft, glossy, and of a fine black. Its face is covered with\r\na mask of a square form and a whitish colour tinged with blue. This\r\nmask contains the eyes, nose, and mouth. The ears have a rim: they are\r\nsmall, very pretty, and almost bare. The neck of the widow presents in\r\nfront a white band, an inch broad, and forming a semicircle. The feet,\r\nor rather the hinder hands, are black like the rest of the body; but\r\nthe fore paws are white without, and of a glossy black within. In\r\nthese marks, or white spots, the missionaries think they recognize the\r\nveil, the neckerchief, and the gloves of a widow in mourning. The\r\ncharacter of this little monkey, which sits up on its hinder\r\nextremities only when eating, is but little indicated in its\r\nappearance. It has a wild and timid air; it often refuses the food\r\noffered to it, even when tormented by a ravenous appetite. It has\r\nlittle inclination for the society of other monkeys. The sight of the\r\nsmallest saimiri puts it to flight. Its eye denotes great vivacity. We\r\nhave seen it remain whole hours motionless without sleeping, and\r\nattentive to everything that was passing around. But this wildness and\r\ntimidity are merely apparent. The viudita, when alone, and left to\r\nitself, becomes furious at the sight of a bird. It then climbs and\r\nruns with astonishing rapidity; darts upon its prey like a cat; and\r\nkills whatever it can seize. This rare and delicate monkey is found on\r\nthe right bank of the Orinoco, in the granite mountains which rise\r\nbehind the Mission of Santa Barbara. It inhabits also the banks of the\r\nGuaviare, near San Fernando de Atabapo.\r\n\r\nThe viudita accompanied us on our whole voyage on the Cassiquiare and\r\nthe Rio Negro, passing the cataracts twice. In studying the manners of\r\nanimals, it is a great advantage to observe them during several months\r\nin the open air, and not in houses, where they lose all their natural\r\nvivacity.\r\n\r\nThe new canoe intended for us was, like all Indian boats, a trunk of a\r\ntree hollowed out partly by the hatchet and partly by fire. It was\r\nforty feet long, and three broad. Three persons could not sit in it\r\nside by side. These canoes are so crank, and they require, from their\r\ninstability, a cargo so equally distributed, that when you want to\r\nrise for an instant, you must warn the rowers to lean to the opposite\r\nside. Without this precaution the water would necessarily enter the\r\nside pressed down. It is difficult to form an idea of the\r\ninconveniences that are suffered in such wretched vessels.\r\n\r\nThe missionary from the cataracts made the preparations for our voyage\r\nwith greater energy than we wished. Lest there might not be a\r\nsufficient number of the Maco and Guahibe Indians, who are acquainted\r\nwith the labyrinth of small channels and cascades of which the\r\nRaudales or cataracts are composed, two Indians were, during the\r\nnight, placed in the cepo--a sort of stocks in which they were made to\r\nlie with their legs between two pieces of wood, notched and fastened\r\ntogether by a chain with a padlock. Early in the morning we were\r\nawakened by the cries of a young man, mercilessly beaten with a whip\r\nof manatee skin. His name was Zerepe, a very intelligent young Indian,\r\nwho proved highly useful to us in the sequel, but who now refused to\r\naccompany us. He was born in the Mission of Atures; but his father was\r\na Maco, and his mother a native of the nation of the Maypures. He had\r\nreturned to the woods (al monte), and having lived some years with the\r\nunsubdued Indians, he had thus acquired the knowledge of several\r\nlanguages, and the missionary employed him as an interpreter. We\r\nobtained with difficulty the pardon of this young man. \"Without these\r\nacts of severity,\" we were told, \"you would want for everything. The\r\nIndians of the Raudales and the Upper Orinoco are a stronger and more\r\nlaborious race than the inhabitants of the Lower Orinoco. They know\r\nthat they are much sought after at Angostura. If left to their own\r\nwill, they would all go down the river to sell their productions, and\r\nlive in full liberty among the whites. The Missions would be totally\r\ndeserted.\"\r\n\r\nThese reasons, I confess, appeared to me more specious than sound.\r\nMan, in order to enjoy the advantages of a social state, must no doubt\r\nsacrifice a part of his natural rights, and his original independence;\r\nbut, if the sacrifice imposed on him be not compensated by the\r\nbenefits of civilization, the savage, wise in his simplicity, retains\r\nthe wish of returning to the forests that gave him birth. It is\r\nbecause the Indian of the woods is treated like a person in a state of\r\nvillanage in the greater part of the Missions, because he enjoys not\r\nthe fruit of his labours, that the Christian establishments on the\r\nOrinoco remain deserts. A government founded on the ruins of the\r\nliberty of the natives extinguishes the intellectual faculties, or\r\nstops their progress.\r\n\r\nTo say that the savage, like the child, can be governed only by force,\r\nis merely to establish false analogies. The Indians of the Orinoco\r\nhave something infantine in the expression of their joy, and the quick\r\nsuccession of their emotions, but they are not great children; they\r\nare as little so as the poor labourers in the east of Europe, whom the\r\nbarbarism of our feudal institutions has held in the rudest state. To\r\nconsider the employment of force as the first and sole means of the\r\ncivilization of the savage, is a principle as far from being true in\r\nthe education of nations as in the education of youth. Whatever may be\r\nthe state of weakness or degradation in our species, no faculty is\r\nentirely annihilated. The human understanding exhibits only different\r\ndegrees of strength and development. The savage, like the child,\r\ncompares the present with the past; he directs his actions, not\r\naccording to blind instinct, but motives of interest. Reason can\r\neverywhere enlighten reason; and its progress will be retarded in\r\nproportion as the men who are called upon to bring up youth, or govern\r\nnations, substitute constraint and force for that moral influence\r\nwhich can alone unfold the rising faculties, calm the irritated\r\npassions, and give stability to social order.\r\n\r\nWe could not set sail before ten on the morning of the 10th. To gain\r\nsomething in breadth in our new canoe, a sort of lattice-work had been\r\nconstructed on the stern with branches of trees, that extended on each\r\nside beyond the gunwale. Unfortunately, the toldo or roof of leaves,\r\nthat covered this lattice-work, was so low that we were obliged to lie\r\ndown, without seeing anything, or, if seated, to sit nearly double.\r\nThe necessity of carrying the canoe across the rapids, and even from\r\none river to another; and the fear of giving too much hold to the\r\nwind, by making the toldo higher, render this construction necessary\r\nfor vessels that go up towards the Rio Negro. The toldo was intended\r\nto cover four persons, lying on the deck or lattice-work of\r\nbrush-wood; but our legs reached far beyond it, and when it rained\r\nhalf our bodies were wet. Our couches consisted of ox-hides or\r\ntiger-skins, spread upon branches of trees, which were painfully felt\r\nthrough so thin a covering. The fore part of the boat was filled with\r\nIndian rowers, furnished with paddles, three feet long, in the form of\r\nspoons. They were all naked, seated two by two, and they kept time in\r\nrowing with a surprising uniformity, singing songs of a sad and\r\nmonotonous character. The small cages containing our birds and our\r\nmonkeys, the number of which augmented as we advanced, were hung some\r\nto the toldo and others to the bow of the boat. This was our\r\ntravelling menagerie. Notwithstanding the frequent losses occasioned\r\nby accidents, and above all by the fatal effects of exposure to the\r\nsun, we had fourteen of these little animals alive at our return from\r\nthe Cassiquiare. Naturalists, who wish to collect and bring living\r\nanimals to Europe, might cause boats to be constructed expressly for\r\nthis purpose at Angostura, or at Grand Para, the two capitals situated\r\non the banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon, the fore-deck of which\r\nboats might be fitted up with two rows of cages sheltered from the\r\nrays of the sun. Every night, when we established our watch, our\r\ncollection of animals and our instruments occupied the centre; around\r\nthese were placed first our hammocks, then the hammocks of the\r\nIndians; and on the outside were the fires which are thought\r\nindispensable against the attacks of the jaguar. About sunrise the\r\nmonkeys in our cages answered the cries of the monkeys of the forest.\r\nThese communications between animals of the same species sympathizing\r\nwith one another, though unseen, one party enjoying that liberty which\r\nthe other regrets, have something melancholy and affecting.\r\n\r\nIn a canoe not three feet wide, and so incumbered, there remained no\r\nother place for the dried plants, trunks, a sextant, a dipping-needle,\r\nand the meteorological instruments, than the space below the\r\nlattice-work of branches, on which we were compelled to remain\r\nstretched the greater part of the day. If we wished to take the least\r\nobject out of a trunk, or to use an instrument, it was necessary to\r\nrow ashore and land. To these inconveniences were joined the torment\r\nof the mosquitos which swarmed under the toldo, and the heat radiated\r\nfrom the leaves of the palm-trees, the upper surface of which was\r\ncontinually exposed to the solar rays. We attempted every instant, but\r\nalways without success, to amend our situation. While one of us hid\r\nhimself under a sheet to ward off the insects, the other insisted on\r\nhaving green wood lighted beneath the toldo, in the hope of driving\r\naway the mosquitos by the smoke. The painful sensations of the eyes,\r\nand the increase of heat, already stifling, rendered both these\r\ncontrivances alike impracticable. With some gaiety of temper, with\r\nfeelings of mutual good-will, and with a vivid taste for the majestic\r\ngrandeur of these vast valleys of rivers, travellers easily support\r\nevils that become habitual.\r\n\r\nOur Indians showed us, on the right bank of the river, the place which\r\nwas formerly the site of the Mission of Pararuma, founded by the\r\nJesuits about the year 1733. The mortality occasioned by the smallpox\r\namong the Salive Indians was the principal cause of the dissolution of\r\nthe mission. The few inhabitants who survived this cruel epidemic,\r\nremoved to the village of Carichana. It was at Pararuma, that,\r\naccording to the testimony of Father Roman, hail was seen to fall\r\nduring a great storm, about the middle of the last century. This is\r\nalmost the only instance of it I know in a plain that is nearly on a\r\nlevel with the sea; for hail falls generally, between the tropics,\r\nonly at three hundred toises of elevation. If it form at an equal\r\nheight over plains and table-lands, we must suppose that it melts as\r\nit falls, in passing through the lowest strata of the atmosphere, the\r\nmean temperature of which is from 27.5 to 24 degrees of the centigrade\r\nthermometer. I acknowledge it is very difficult to explain, in the\r\npresent state of meteorology, why it hails at Philadelphia, at Rome,\r\nand at Montpelier, during the hottest months, the mean temperature of\r\nwhich attains 25 or 26 degrees; while the same phenomenon is not\r\nobserved at Cumana, at La Guayra, and in general, in the equatorial\r\nplains. In the United States, and in the south of Europe, the heat of\r\nthe plains (from 40 to 43 degrees latitude) is nearly the same as\r\nwithin the tropics; and according to my researches the decrement of\r\ncaloric equally varies but little. If then the absence of hail within\r\nthe torrid zone, at the level of the sea, be produced by the melting\r\nof the hailstones in crossing the lower strata of the air, we must\r\nsuppose that these hail-stones, at the moment of their formation, are\r\nlarger in the temperate than in the torrid zone. We yet know so little\r\nof the conditions under which water congeals in a stormy cloud in our\r\nclimates, that we cannot judge whether the same conditions be\r\nfulfilled on the equator above the plains. The clouds in which we hear\r\nthe rattling of the hailstones against one another before they fall,\r\nand which move horizontally, have always appeared to me of little\r\nelevation; and at these small heights we may conceive that\r\nextraordinary refrigerations are caused by the dilatation of the\r\nascending air, of which the capacity for caloric augments; by currents\r\nof cold air coming from a higher latitude, and above all, according to\r\nM. Gay Lussac, by the radiation from the upper surface of the clouds.\r\nI shall have occasion to return to this subject when speaking of the\r\ndifferent forms under which hail and hoar-frost appear on the Andes,\r\nat two thousand and two thousand six hundred toises of height; and\r\nwhen examining the question whether we may consider the stratum of\r\nclouds that envelops the mountains as a horizontal continuation of the\r\nstratum which we see immediately above us in the plains.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco, full of islands, begins to divide itself into several\r\nbranches, of which the most western remain dry during the months of\r\nJanuary and February. The total breadth of the river exceeds two\r\nthousand five hundred or three thousand toises. We perceived to the\r\nEast, opposite the island of Javanavo, the mouth of the Cano Aujacoa.\r\nBetween this Cano and the Rio Paruasi or Paruati, the country becomes\r\nmore and more woody. A solitary rock, of extremely picturesque aspect,\r\nrises in the midst of a forest of palm-trees, not far from the\r\nOrinoco. It is a pillar of granite, a prismatic mass, the bare and\r\nsteep sides of which attain nearly two hundred feet in height. Its\r\npoint, which overtops the highest trees of the forest, is terminated\r\nby a shelf of rock with a horizontal and smooth surface. Other trees\r\ncrown this summit, which the missionaries call the peak, or Mogote de\r\nCocuyza. This monument of nature, in its simple grandeur recalls to\r\nmind the Cyclopean remains of antiquity. Its strongly-marked outlines,\r\nand the group of trees and shrubs by which it is crowned, stand out\r\nfrom the azure of the sky. It seems a forest rising above a forest.\r\n\r\nFurther on, near the mouth of the Paruasi, the Orinoco narrows. On the\r\neast is perceived a mountain with a bare top, projecting like a\r\npromontory. It is nearly three hundred feet high, and served as a\r\nfortress for the Jesuits. They had constructed there a small fort,\r\nwith three batteries of cannon, and it was constantly occupied by a\r\nmilitary detachment. We saw the cannon dismounted, and half-buried in\r\nthe sand, at Carichana and at Atures. This fort of the Jesuits has\r\nbeen destroyed since the dissolution of their society; but the place\r\nis still called El Castillo. I find it set down, in a manuscript map,\r\nlately completed at Caracas by a member of the secular clergy, under\r\nthe denomination of Trinchera del despotismo monacal.* (*\r\nIntrenchmnent of monachal despotism.)\r\n\r\nThe garrison which the Jesuits maintained on this rock, was not\r\nintended merely to protect the Missions against the incursions of the\r\nCaribs: it was employed also in an offensive war, or, as they say\r\nhere, in the conquest of souls (conquista de almas). The soldiers,\r\nexcited by the allurement of gain, made military incursions (entradas)\r\ninto the lands of the independent Indians. They killed all those who\r\ndared to make any resistance, burnt their huts, destroyed their\r\nplantations, and carried away the women, children, and old men, as\r\nprisoners. These prisoners were divided among the Missions of the\r\nMeta, the Rio Negro, and the Upper Orinoco. The most distant places\r\nwere chosen, that they might not be tempted to return to their native\r\ncountry. This violent manner of conquering souls, though prohibited by\r\nthe Spanish laws, was tolerated by the civil governors, and vaunted by\r\nthe superiors of the society, as beneficial to religion, and the\r\naggrandizement of the Missions. \"The voice of the Gospel is heard\r\nonly,\" said a Jesuit of the Orinoco, very candidly, in the Cartas\r\nEdifiantes, \"where the Indians have heard also the sound of fire-arms\r\n(el eco de la polvora). Mildness is a very slow measure. By chastising\r\nthe natives, we facilitate their conversion.\" These principles, which\r\ndegrade humanity, were certainly not common to all the members of a\r\nsociety which, in the New World, and wherever education has remained\r\nexclusively in the hands of monks, has rendered service to letters and\r\ncivilization. But the entradas, the spiritual conquests with the\r\nassistance of bayonets, was an inherent vice in a system, that tended\r\nto the rapid aggrandizement of the Missions. It is pleasing to find\r\nthat the same system is not followed by the Franciscan, Dominican, and\r\nAugustinian monks who now govern a vast portion of South America; and\r\nwho, by the mildness or harshness of their manners, exert a powerful\r\ninfluence over the fate of so many thousands of natives. Military\r\nincursions are almost entirely abolished; and when they do take place,\r\nthey are disavowed by the superiors of the orders. We will not decide\r\nat present, whether this amelioration of the monachal system be owing\r\nto want of activity and cold indolence; or whether it must be\r\nattributed, as we would wish to believe, to the progress of knowledge,\r\nand to feelings more elevated, and more conformable to the true spirit\r\nof Christianity.\r\n\r\nBeyond the mouth of the Rio Paruasi, the Orinoco again narrows. Full\r\nof little islands and masses of granite rock, it presents rapids, or\r\nsmall cascades (remolinos), which at first sight may alarm the\r\ntraveller by the continual eddies of the water, but which at no season\r\nof the year are dangerous for boats. A range of shoals, that crosses\r\nalmost the whole river, bears the name of the Raudal de Marimara. We\r\npassed it without difficulty by a narrow channel, in which the water\r\nseems to boil up as it issues out impetuously* (* These places are\r\ncalled chorreros in the Spanish colonies.) below the Piedra de\r\nMarimara, a compact mass of granite eighty feet high, and three\r\nhundred feet in circumference, without fissures, or any trace of\r\nstratification. The river penetrates far into the land, and forms\r\nspacious bays in the rocks. One of these bays, inclosed between two\r\npromontories destitute of vegetation, is called the Port of\r\nCarichana.* (* Piedra y puerto de Carichana.) The spot has a very wild\r\naspect. In the evening the rocky coasts project their vast shadows\r\nover the surface of the river. The waters appear black from reflecting\r\nthe image of these granitic masses, which, in the colour of their\r\nexternal surface, sometimes resemble coal, and sometimes lead-ore. We\r\npassed the night in the small village of Carichana, where we were\r\nreceived at the priest's house, or convento. It was nearly a fortnight\r\nsince we had slept under a roof.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the effects of the inundations, often so fatal to health, the\r\nMission of Carichana has been established at three quarters of a\r\nleague from the river. The Indians in this Mission are of the nation\r\nof the Salives, and they have a disagreeable and nasal pronunciation.\r\nTheir language, of which the Jesuit Anisson has composed a grammar\r\nstill in manuscript, is, with the Caribbean, the Tamanac, the Maypure,\r\nthe Ottomac, the Guahive, and the Jaruro, one of the mother-tongues\r\nmost general on the Orinoco. Father Gili thinks that the Ature, the\r\nPiraoa, and the Quaqua or Mapoye, are only dialects of the Salive. My\r\njourney was much too rapid to enable me to judge of the accuracy of\r\nthis opinion; but we shall soon see that, in the village of Ature,\r\ncelebrated on account of its situation near the great cataracts,\r\nneither the Salive nor the Ature is now spoken, but the language of\r\nthe Maypures. In the Salive of Carichana, man is called cocco; woman,\r\ngnacu; water, cagua; fire, eyussa; the earth, seke; the sky, mumeseke\r\n(earth on high); the jaguar, impii; the crocodile, cuipoo; maize,\r\ngiomu; the plantain, paratuna; cassava, peibe. I may here mention one\r\nof those descriptive compounds that seem to characterise the infancy\r\nof language, though they are retained in some very perfect idioms.*\r\n(See volume 1 chapter 1.9.) Thus, as in the Biscayan, thunder is\r\ncalled the noise of the cloud (odotsa); the sun bears the name, in the\r\nSalive dialect, of mume-seke-cocco, the man (cocco) of the earth\r\n(seke) above (mume).\r\n\r\nThe most ancient abode of the Salive nation appears to have been on\r\nthe western banks of the Orinoco, between the Rio Vichada* and the\r\nGuaviare, and also between the Meta and the Rio Paute. (* The Salive\r\nmission, on the Rio Vichada, was destroyed by the Caribs.) Salives are\r\nnow found not only at Carichana, but in the Missions of the province\r\nof Casanre, at Cabapuna, Guanapalo, Cabiuna, and Macuco. They are a\r\nsocial, mild, almost timid people; and more easy, I will not say to\r\ncivilize, but to subdue, than the other tribes on the Orinoco. To\r\nescape from the dominion of the Caribs, the Salives willingly joined\r\nthe first Missions of the Jesuits. Accordingly these fathers\r\neverywhere in their writings praise the docility and intelligence of\r\nthat people. The Salives have a great taste for music: in the most\r\nremote times they had trumpets of baked earth, four or five feet long,\r\nwith several large globular cavities communicating with one another by\r\nnarrow pipes. These trumpets send forth most dismal sounds. The\r\nJesuits have cultivated with success the natural taste of the Salives\r\nfor instrumental music; and even since the destruction of the society,\r\nthe missionaries of Rio Meta have continued at San Miguel de Macuco a\r\nfine church choir, and musical instruction for the Indian youth. Very\r\nlately a traveller was surprised to see the natives playing on the\r\nviolin, the violoncello, the triangle, the guitar, and the flute.\r\n\r\nWe found among these Salive Indians, at Carichana, a white woman, the\r\nsister of a Jesuit of New Grenada. It is difficult to define the\r\nsatisfaction that is felt when, in the midst of nations of whose\r\nlanguage we are ignorant, we meet with a being with whom we can\r\nconverse without an interpreter. Every mission has at least two\r\ninterpreters (lenguarazes). They are Indians, a little less stupid\r\nthan the rest, through whose medium the missionaries of the Orinoco,\r\nwho now very rarely give themselves the trouble of studying the idioms\r\nof the country, communicate with the neophytes. These interpreters\r\nattended us in all our herborizations; but they rather understand than\r\nspeak Castilian. With their indolent indifference, they answer us by\r\nchance, but always with an officious smile, \"Yes, Father; no, Father,\"\r\nto every question addressed to them.\r\n\r\nThe vexation that arises from such a style of conversation continued\r\nfor months may easily be conceived, when you wish to be enlightened\r\nupon objects in which you take the most lively interest. We were often\r\nforced to employ several interpreters at a time, and several\r\nsuccessive translators, in order to communicate with the natives.* (*\r\nTo form a just idea of the perplexity of these communications by\r\ninterpreters, we may recollect that, in the expedition of Lewis and\r\nClarke to the river Columbia, in order to converse with the Chopunnish\r\nIndians, Captain Lewis addressed one of his men in English; that man\r\ntranslated the question into French to Chaboneau; Chaboneau translated\r\nit to his Indian wife in Minnetaree; the woman translated it into\r\nShoshonee to a prisoner; and the prisoner translated it into\r\nChopunnish. It may be feared that the sense of the question was a\r\nlittle altered by these successive translations.)\r\n\r\n\"After leaving my Mission,\" said the good monk of Uruana, \"you will\r\ntravel like mutes.\" This prediction was nearly accomplished; and, not\r\nto lose the advantage we might derive from intercourse even with the\r\nrudest Indians, we sometimes preferred the language of signs. When a\r\nnative perceives that you will not employ an interpreter; when you\r\ninterrogate him directly, showing him the objects; he rouses himself\r\nfrom his habitual apathy, and manifests an extraordinary capacity to\r\nmake himself comprehended. He varies his signs, pronounces his words\r\nslowly, and repeats them without being desired. The consequence\r\nconferred upon him, in suffering yourself to be instructed by him,\r\nflatters his self-love. This facility in making himself comprehended\r\nis particularly remarkable in the independent Indian. It cannot be\r\ndoubted that direct intercourse with the natives is more instructive\r\nand more certain than the communication by interpreters, provided the\r\nquestions be simplified, and repeated to several individuals under\r\ndifferent forms. The variety of idioms spoken on the banks of the\r\nMeta, the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro, is so\r\nprodigious, that a traveller, however great may be his talent for\r\nlanguages, can never hope to learn enough to make himself understood\r\nalong the navigable rivers, from Angostura to the small fort of San\r\nCarlos del Rio Negro. In Peru and Quito it is sufficient to know the\r\nQuichua, or the Inca language; in Chile, the Araucan; and in Paraguay,\r\nthe Guarany; in order to be understood by most of the population. But\r\nit is different in the Missions of Spanish Guiana, where nations of\r\nvarious races are mingled in the village. It is not even sufficient to\r\nhave learned the Caribee or Carina, the Guamo, the Guahive, the\r\nJaruro, the Ottomac, the Maypure, the Salive, the Marivitan, the\r\nMaquiritare, and the Guaica, ten dialects, of which there exist only\r\nimperfect grammars, and which have less affinity with each other than\r\nthe Greek, German, and Persian languages.\r\n\r\nThe environs of the Mission of Carichana appeared to us to be\r\ndelightful. The little village is situated in one of those plains\r\ncovered with grass that separate all the links of the granitic\r\nmountains, from Encaramada to beyond the Cataracts of Maypures. The\r\nline of the forests is seen only in the distance. The horizon is\r\neverywhere bounded by mountains, partly wooded and of a dark tint,\r\npartly bare, with rocky summits gilded by the beams of the setting\r\nsun. What gives a peculiar character to the scenery of this country\r\nare banks of rock (laxas) nearly destitute of vegetation, and often\r\nmore than eight hundred feet in circumference, yet scarcely rising a\r\nfew inches above the surrounding savannahs. They now make a part of\r\nthe plain. We ask ourselves with surprise, whether some extraordinary\r\nrevolutions may have carried away the earth and plants; or whether the\r\ngranite nucleus of our planet shows itself bare, because the germs of\r\nlife are not yet developed on all its points. The same phenomenon\r\nseems to be found also in the desert of Shamo, which separates\r\nMongolia from China. Those banks of solitary rock in the desert are\r\ncalled tsy. I think they would be real table-lands, if the surrounding\r\nplains were stripped of the sand and mould that cover them, and which\r\nthe waters have accumulated in the lowest places. On these stony flats\r\nof Carichana we observed with interest the rising vegetation in the\r\ndifferent degrees of its development. We there found lichens cleaving\r\nthe rock, and collected in crusts more or less thick; little portions\r\nof sand nourishing succulent plants; and lastly layers of black mould\r\ndeposited in the hollows, formed from the decay of roots and leaves,\r\nand shaded by tufts of evergreen shrubs.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of two or three leagues from the Mission, we find, in\r\nthese plains intersected by granitic hills, a vegetation no less rich\r\nthan varied. On comparing the site of Carichana with that of all the\r\nvillages above the Great Cataracts, we are surprised at the facility\r\nwith which we traverse the country, without following the banks of the\r\nrivers, or being stopped by the thickness of the forests. M. Bonpland\r\nmade several excursions on horseback, which furnished him with a rich\r\nharvest of plants. I shall mention only the paraguatan, a magnificent\r\nspecies of the macrocnemum, the bark of which yields a red dye;* (*\r\nMacrocnemum tinctorium.) the guaricamo, with a poisonous root;* (*\r\nItyania coccidea.) the Jacaranda obtusifolia; and the serrape, or\r\njape* (* Dipterix odorata, Willd. or Baryosma tongo of Gaertner. The\r\njape furnishes Carichana with excellent timber.) of the Salive\r\nIndians, which is the Coumarouna of Aublet, so celebrated throughout\r\nTerra Firma for its aromatic fruit. This fruit, which at Caracas is\r\nplaced among linen, as in Europe it is in snuff, under the name of\r\ntonca, or Tonquin bean, is regarded as poisonous. It is a false\r\nnotion, very general in the province of Cumana, that the excellent\r\nliqueur fabricated at Martinique owes its peculiar flavour to the\r\njape. In the Missions it is called simaruba; a name that may occasion\r\nserious mistakes, the true simaruba being a febrifuge species of the\r\nQuassia genus, found in Spanish Guiana only in the valley of Rio\r\nCaura, where the Paudacot Indians give it the name of achecchari.\r\n\r\nI found the dip of the magnetic needle, in the great square at\r\nCarichana, 33.7 degrees (new division). The intensity of the magnetic\r\naction was expressed by two hundred and twenty-seven oscillations in\r\nten minutes of time; an increase of force that would seem to indicate\r\nsome local attraction. Yet the blocks of the granite, blackened by the\r\nwaters of the Orinoco, have no perceptible action upon the needle.\r\n\r\nThe river had risen several inches during the day on the 10th of\r\nApril; this phenomenon surprised the natives so much the more, as the\r\nfirst swellings are almost imperceptible, and are usually followed in\r\nthe month of April by a fall for some days. The Orinoco was already\r\nthree feet higher than the level of the lowest waters. The natives\r\nshowed us on a granite wall the traces of the great rise of the waters\r\nof late years. We found them to be forty-two feet high, which is\r\ndouble the mean rise of the Nile. But this measure was taken in a\r\nplace where the bed of the Orinoco is singularly hemmed in by rocks,\r\nand I could only notice the marks shown me by the natives. It may\r\neasily be conceived that the effect and the height of the increase\r\ndiffers according to the profile of the river, the nature of the banks\r\nmore or less elevated, the number of rivers flowing in that collect\r\nthe pluvial waters, and the length of ground passed over. It is an\r\nunquestionable fact that at Carichana, at San Borja, at Atures, and at\r\nMaypures, wherever the river has forced its way through the mountains,\r\nyou see at a hundred, sometimes at a hundred and thirty feet, above\r\nthe highest present swell of the river, black bands and erosions, that\r\nindicate the ancient levels of the waters. Is then this river, which\r\nappears to us so grand and so majestic, only the feeble remains of\r\nthose immense currents of fresh water which heretofore traversed the\r\ncountry at the east of the Andes, like arms of inland seas? What must\r\nhave been the state of those low countries of Guiana that now undergo\r\nthe effects of annual inundations? What immense numbers of crocodiles,\r\nmanatees, and boas must have inhabited these vast spaces of land,\r\nconverted alternately into marshes of stagnant water, and into barren\r\nand fissured plains! The more peaceful world which we inhabit has then\r\nsucceeded to a world of tumult. The bones of mastodons and American\r\nelephants are found dispersed on the table-lands of the Andes. The\r\nmegatherium inhabited the plains of Uruguay. On digging deep into the\r\nground, in high valleys, where neither palm-trees nor arborescent\r\nferns can grow, strata of coal are discovered, that still show\r\nvestiges of gigantic monocotyledonous plants.\r\n\r\nThere was a remote period then, in which the classes of plants were\r\notherwise distributed, when the animals were larger, and the rivers\r\nbroader and of greater depth. There end those records of nature, that\r\nit is in our power to consult. We are ignorant whether the human race,\r\nwhich at the time of the discovery of America scarcely formed a few\r\nfeeble tribes on the east of the Cordilleras, had already descended\r\ninto the plains; or whether the ancient tradition of the great waters,\r\nwhich is found among the nations of the Orinoco, the Erevato, and the\r\nCaura, belong to other climates, whence it has been propagated to this\r\npart of the New Continent.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of April, we left Carichana at two in the afternoon, and\r\nfound the course of the river more and more encumbered by blocks of\r\ngranite rocks. We passed on the west the Cano Orupe, and then the\r\ngreat rock known by the name of Piedra del Tigre. The river is there\r\nso deep, that no bottom can be found with a line of twenty-two\r\nfathoms. Towards evening the weather became cloudy and gloomy. The\r\nproximity of the storm was marked by squalls alternating with dead\r\ncalms. The rain was violent, and the roof of foliage, under which we\r\nlay, afforded but little shelter. Happily these showers drove away the\r\nmosquitos, at least for some time. We found ourselves before the\r\ncataract of Cariven, and the impulse of the waters was so strong, that\r\nwe had great difficulty in gaining the land. We were continually\r\ndriven back to the middle of the current. At length two Salive\r\nIndians, excellent swimmers, leaped into the water, and having drawn\r\nthe boat to shore by means of a rope, made it fast to the Piedra de\r\nCarichana Vieja, a shelf of bare rock, on which we passed the night.\r\nThe thunder continued to roll during a part of the night; the swell of\r\nthe river became considerable; and we were several times afraid that\r\nour frail bark would be driven from the shore by the impetuosity of\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nThe granitic rock on which we lay is one of those, where travellers on\r\nthe Orinoco have heard from time to time, towards sunrise,\r\nsubterraneous sounds, resembling those of the organ. The missionaries\r\ncall these stones laxas de musica. \"It is witchcraft (cosa de\r\nbruxas),\" said our young Indian pilot, who could speak Spanish. We\r\nnever ourselves heard these mysterious sounds, either at Carichana\r\nVieja, or in the Upper Orinoco; but from information given us by\r\nwitnesses worthy of belief, the existence of a phenomenon that seems\r\nto depend on a certain state of the atmosphere, cannot be denied. The\r\nshelves of rock are full of very narrow and deep crevices. They are\r\nheated during the day to 48 or 50 degrees. I several times found their\r\ntemperature at the surface, during the night, at 39 degrees, the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere being at 28 degrees. It may easily be\r\nconceived, that the difference of temperature between the subterranean\r\nand the external air attains its maximum about sunrise, or at that\r\nmoment which is at the same time farthest from the period of the\r\nmaximum of the heat of the preceding day. May not these organ-like\r\nsounds, which are heard when a person lays his ear in contact with the\r\nstone, be the effect of a current of air that issues out through the\r\ncrevices? Does not the impulse of the air against the elastic spangles\r\nof mica that intercept the crevices, contribute to modify the sounds?\r\nMay we not admit that the ancient inhabitants of Egypt, in passing\r\nincessantly up and down the Nile, had made the same observation on\r\nsome rock of the Thebaid; and that the music of the rocks there led to\r\nthe jugglery of the priests in the statue of Memnon? Perhaps, when,\r\n\"the rosy-fingered Aurora rendered her son, the glorious Memnon,\r\nvocal,\"* (* These are the words of an inscription, which attests that\r\nsounds were heard on the 13th of the month Pachon, in the tenth year\r\nof the reign of Antoninus. See Monuments de l'Egypte Ancienne.) the\r\nvoice was that of a man hidden beneath the pedestal of the statue; but\r\nthe observation of the natives of the Orinoco, which we relate, seems\r\nto explain in a natural manner what gave rise to the Egyptian belief\r\nof a stone that poured forth sounds at sunrise.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same period at which I communicated these conjectures to\r\nsome of the learned of Europe, three French travellers, MM. Jomard,\r\nJollois, and Devilliers, were led to analogous ideas. They heard, at\r\nsunrise, in a monument of granite, at the centre of the spot on which\r\nstands the palace of Karnak, a noise resembling that of a string\r\nbreaking. Now this comparison is precisely that which the ancients\r\nemployed in speaking of the voice of Memnon. The French travellers\r\nthought, like me, that the passage of rarefied air through the\r\nfissures of a sonorous stone might have suggested to the Egyptian\r\npriests the invention of the juggleries of the Memnomium.\r\n\r\nWe left the rock at four in the morning. The missionary had told us\r\nthat we should have great difficulty in passing the rapids and the\r\nmouth of the Meta. The Indians rowed twelve hours and a half without\r\nintermission, and during all that time, they took no other nourishment\r\nthan cassava and plantains. When we consider the difficulty of\r\novercoming the force of the current, and of passing the cataracts;\r\nwhen we reflect on the constant employment of the muscular powers\r\nduring a navigation of two months; we are equally surprised at the\r\nconstitutional vigour and the abstinence of the Indians of the Orinoco\r\nand the Amazon. Amylaceous and saccharine substances, sometimes fish\r\nand the fat of turtles' eggs, supply the place of food drawn from the\r\nfirst two classes of the animal kingdom, those of quadrupeds and\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nWe found the bed of the river, to the length of six hundred toises,\r\nfull of granite rocks. Here is what is called the Raudal de Cariven.\r\nWe passed through channels that were not five feet broad. Our canoe\r\nwas sometimes jammed between two blocks of granite. We sought to avoid\r\nthese passages, into which the waters rushed with a fearful noise; but\r\nthere is really little danger, in a canoe steered by a good Indian\r\npilot. When the current is too violent to be resisted the rowers leap\r\ninto the water, and fasten a rope to the point of a rock, to warp the\r\nboat along. This manoeuvre is very tedious; and we sometimes availed\r\nourselves of it, to climb the rocks among which we were entangled.\r\nThey are of all dimensions, rounded, very black, glossy like lead, and\r\ndestitute of vegetation. It is an extraordinary phenomenon to see the\r\nwaters of one of the largest rivers on the globe in some sort\r\ndisappear. We perceived, even far from the shore, those immense blocks\r\nof granite, rising from the ground, and leaning one against another.\r\nThe intervening channels in the rapids are more than twenty-five\r\nfathoms deep; and are the more difficult to be observed, as the rocks\r\nare often narrow toward their bases, and form vaults suspended over\r\nthe surface of the river. We perceived no crocodiles in the raudal;\r\nthese animals seem to shun the noise of cataracts.\r\n\r\nFrom Cabruta to the mouth of the Rio Sinaruco, a distance of nearly\r\ntwo degrees of latitude, the left bank of the Orinoco is entirely\r\nuninhabited; but to the west of the Raudal de Cariven an enterprising\r\nman, Don Felix Relinchon, had assembled some Jaruro and Ottomac\r\nIndians in a small village. It is an attempt at civilization, on which\r\nthe monks have had no direct influence. It is superfluous to add, that\r\nDon Felix lives at open war with the missionaries on the right bank of\r\nthe Orinoco.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the river we arrived, at nine in the morning, before the\r\nmouth of the Meta, opposite the spot where the Mission of Santa\r\nTeresa, founded by the Jesuits, was heretofore situated.\r\n\r\nNext to the Guaviare, the Meta is the most considerable river that\r\nflows into the Orinoco. It may be compared to the Danube, not for the\r\nlength of its course, but for the volume of its waters. Its mean depth\r\nis thirty-six feet, and it sometimes reaches eighty-four. The union of\r\nthese two rivers presents a very impressive spectacle. Lonely rocks\r\nrise on the eastern bank. Blocks of granite, piled upon one another,\r\nappear from afar like castles in ruins. Vast sandy shores keep the\r\nskirting of the forest at a distance from the river; but we discover\r\namid them, in the horizon, solitary palm-trees, backed by the sky, and\r\ncrowning the tops of the mountains. We passed two hours on a large\r\nrock, standing in the middle of the Orinoco, and called the Piedra de\r\nla Paciencia, or the Stone of Patience, because the canoes, in going\r\nup, are sometimes detained there two days, to extricate themselves\r\nfrom the whirlpool caused by this rock.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Meta, which traverses the vast plains of Casanare, and which\r\nis navigable as far as the foot of the Andes of New Grenada, will one\r\nday be of great political importance to the inhabitants of Guiana and\r\nVenezuela. From the Golfo Triste and the Boca del Drago a small fleet\r\nmay go up the Orinoco and the Meta to within fifteen or twenty leagues\r\nof Santa Fe de Bogota. The flour of New Grenada may be conveyed the\r\nsame way. The Meta is like a canal of communication between countries\r\nplaced in the same latitude, but differing in their productions as\r\nmuch as France and Senegal. The Meta has its source in the union of\r\ntwo rivers which descend from the paramos of Chingasa and Suma Paz.\r\nThe first is the Rio Negro, which, lower down, receives the\r\nPachaquiaro; the second is the Rio de Aguas Blancas, or Umadea. The\r\njunction takes place near the port of Marayal. It is only eight or ten\r\nleagues from the Passo de la Cabulla, where you quit the Rio Negro, to\r\nthe capital of Santa Fe. From the villages of Xiramena and Cabullaro\r\nto those of Guanapalo and Santa Rosalia de Cabapuna, a distance of\r\nsixty leagues, the banks of the Meta are more inhabited than those of\r\nthe Orinoco. We find in this space fourteen Christian settlements, in\r\npart very populous; but from the mouths of the rivers Pauto and\r\nCasanare, for a space of more than fifty leagues, the Meta is infested\r\nby the Guahibos, a race of savages.* (* I find the word written\r\nGuajibos, Guahivos, and Guagivos. They call themselves Gua-iva.)\r\n\r\nThe navigation of this river was much more active in the time of the\r\nJesuits, and particularly during the expedition of Iturriaga, in 1756,\r\nthan it is at present. Missionaries of the same order then governed\r\nthe banks of the Meta and of the Orinoco. The villages of Macuco,\r\nZurimena, and Casimena, were founded by the Jesuits, as well as those\r\nof Uruana, Encaramada, and Carichana.\r\n\r\nThese Fathers had conceived the project of forming a series of\r\nMissions from the junction of the Casanare with the Meta to that of\r\nthe Meta with the Orinoco. A narrow zone of cultivated land would have\r\ncrossed the vast steppes that separate the forests of Guiana from the\r\nAndes of New Grenada.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the harvest of turtles' eggs, not only the flour of\r\nSanta Fe descended the river, but the salt of Chita,* (* East of\r\nLabranza Grande, and the north-west of Pore, now the capital of the\r\nprovince of Casanare.) the cotton cloth of San Gil, and the printed\r\ncounterpanes of Socorro. To give some security to the little traders\r\nwho devoted themselves to this inland commerce, attacks were made from\r\ntime to time from the castillo or fort of Carichana, on the Guahibos.\r\n\r\nTo keep these Guahibos in awe, the Capuchin missionaries, who\r\nsucceeded the Jesuits in the government of the Missions of the\r\nOrinoco, formed the project of founding a city at the mouth of the\r\nMeta, under the name of the Villa de San Carlos. Indolence, and the\r\ndread of tertian fevers, have prevented the execution of this project;\r\nand all that has ever existed of the city of San Carlos, is a coat of\r\narms painted on fine parchment, with an enormous cross erected on the\r\nbank of the Meta. The Guahibos, who, it is said, are some thousands in\r\nnumber, have become so insolent, that, at the time of our passage by\r\nCarichana, they sent word to the missionary that they would come on\r\nrafts, and burn his village. These rafts (valzas), which we had an\r\nopportunity of seeing, are scarcely three feet broad, and twelve feet\r\nlong. They carry only two or three Indians; but fifteen or sixteen of\r\nthese rafts are fastened to each other with the stems of the\r\npaullinia, the dolichos, and other creeping plants. It is difficult to\r\nconceive how these small craft remain tied together in passing the\r\nrapids. Many fugitives from the villages of the Casanare and the Apure\r\nhave joined the Guahibos, and taught them the practice of eating beef,\r\nand preparing hides. The farms of San Vicente, Rubio, and San Antonio,\r\nhave lost great numbers of their horned cattle by the incursions of\r\nthe Indians, who also prevent travellers, as far as the junction of\r\nthe Casanare, from sleeping on the shore in going up the Meta. It\r\noften happens, while the waters are low, that the traders of New\r\nGrenada, some of whom still visit the encampment of Pararuma, are\r\nkilled by the poisoned arrows of the Guahibos.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Meta, the Orinoco appeared to us to be freer of\r\nshoals and rocks. We navigated in a channel five hundred toises broad.\r\nThe Indians remained rowing in the boat, without towing or pushing it\r\nforward with their arms, and wearying us with their wild cries. We\r\npassed the Canos of Uita and Endava on the west. It was night when we\r\nreached the Raudal de Tabaje. The Indians would not hazard passing the\r\ncataract; and we slept on a very incommodious spot, on the shelf of a\r\nrock, with a slope of more than eighteen degrees, and of which the\r\ncrevices sheltered a swarm of bats. We heard the cries of the jaguar\r\nvery near us during the whole night. They were answered by our great\r\ndog in lengthened howlings. I waited the appearance of the stars in\r\nvain: the sky was exceedingly black; and the hoarse sounds of the\r\ncascades of the Orinoco mingled with the rolling of the distant\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 13th April we passed the rapids of Tabaje,\r\nand again disembarked. Father Zea, who accompanied us, desired to\r\nperform mass in the new Mission of San Borja, established two years\r\nbefore. We there found six houses inhabited by uncatechised Guahibos.\r\nThey differ in nothing from the wild Indians. Their eyes, which are\r\nlarge and black, have more vivacity than those of the Indians who\r\ninhabit the ancient missions. We in vain offered them brandy; they\r\nwould not even taste it. The faces of all the young girls were marked\r\nwith round black spots; like the patches by which the ladies of Europe\r\nformerly imagined they set off the whiteness of their skins. The\r\nbodies of the Guahibos were not painted. Several of them had beards,\r\nof which they seemed proud; and, taking us by the chin, showed us by\r\nsigns, that they were made like us. Their shape was in general\r\nslender. I was again struck, as I had been among the Salives and the\r\nMacos, with the little uniformity of features to be found among the\r\nIndians of the Orinoco. Their look is sad and gloomy; but neither\r\nstern nor ferocious. Without having any notion of the practices of the\r\nChristian religion, they behaved with the utmost decency at church.\r\nThe Indians love to exhibit themselves; and will submit temporarily to\r\nany restraint or subjection, provided they are sure of drawing\r\nattention. At the moment of the consecration, they made signs to one\r\nanother, to indicate beforehand that the priest was going to raise the\r\nchalice to his lips. With the exception of this gesture, they remained\r\nmotionless and in imperturbable apathy.\r\n\r\nThe interest with which we examined these poor savages became perhaps\r\nthe cause of the destruction of the mission. Some among them, who\r\npreferred a wandering life to the labours of agriculture, persuaded\r\nthe rest to return to the plains of the Meta. They told them, that the\r\nwhite men would come back to San Borja, to take them away in the\r\nboats, and sell them as poitos, or slaves, at Angostura. The Guahibos\r\nawaited the news of our return from the Rio Negro by the Cassiquiare;\r\nand when they heard that we were arrived at the first great cataract,\r\nthat of Atures, they all deserted, and fled to the savannahs that\r\nborder the Orinoco on the west. The Jesuit Fathers had already formed\r\na mission on this spot, and bearing the same name. No tribe is more\r\ndifficult to fix to the soil than the Guahibos. They would rather feed\r\non stale fish, scolopendras, and worms, than cultivate a little spot\r\nof ground. The other Indians say, that a Guahibo eats everything that\r\nexists, both on and under the ground.\r\n\r\nIn ascending the Orinoco more to the south, the heat, far from\r\nincreasing, became more bearable. The air in the day was at 26 or 27.5\r\ndegrees; and at night, at 23.7. The water of the Orinoco retained its\r\nhabitual temperature of 27.7 degrees. The torment of the mosquitos\r\naugmented severely, notwithstanding the decrease of heat. We never\r\nsuffered so much from them as at San Borja. We could neither speak nor\r\nuncover our faces without having our mouths and noses filled with\r\ninsects. We were surprised not to find the thermometer at 35 or 36\r\ndegrees; the extreme irritation of the skin made us believe that the\r\nair was scorching. We passed the night on the beach of Guaripo. The\r\nfear of the little caribe fish prevented us from bathing. The\r\ncrocodiles we had met with this day were all of an extraordinary size,\r\nfrom twenty-two to twenty-four feet.\r\n\r\nOur sufferings from the zancudos made us depart at five o'clock on the\r\nmorning of the 14th. There are fewer insects in the strata of air\r\nlying immediately on the river, than near the edge of the forests. We\r\nstopped to breakfast at the island of Guachaco, or Vachaco, where the\r\ngranite is immediately covered by a formation of sandstone, or\r\nconglomerate. This sandstone contains fragments of quartz, and even of\r\nfeldspar, cemented by indurated clay. It exhibits little veins of\r\nbrown iron-ore, which separate in laminae, or plates, of one line in\r\nthickness. We had already found these plates on the shores between\r\nEncaramada and Baraguan, where the missionaries had sometimes taken\r\nthem for an ore of gold, and sometimes for tin. It is probable, that\r\nthis secondary formation occupied formerly a larger space. Having\r\npassed the mouth of the Rio Parueni, beyond which the Maco Indians\r\ndwell, we spent the night on the island of Panumana. I could with\r\ndifficulty take the altitudes of Canopus, in order to fix the\r\nlongitude of the point, near which the river suddenly turns towards\r\nthe west. The island of Panumana is rich in plants. We there again\r\nfound those shelves of bare rock, those tufts of melastomas, those\r\nthickets of small shrubs, the blended scenery of which had charmed us\r\nin the plains of Carichana. The mountains of the Great Cataracts\r\nbounded the horizon towards the south-east. In proportion as we\r\nadvanced, the shores of the Orinoco exhibited a more imposing and\r\npicturesque aspect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.20.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUTH OF THE RIO ANAVENI.\r\nPEAK OF UNIANA.\r\nMISSION OF ATURES.\r\nCATARACT, OR RAUDAL OF MAPARA.\r\nISLETS OF SURUPAMANA AND UIRAPURI.\r\n\r\nThe river of the Orinoco, in running from south to north, is crossed\r\nby a chain of granitic mountains. Twice confined in its course, it\r\nturbulently breaks on the rocks, that form steps and transverse dykes.\r\nNothing can be grander than the aspect of this spot. Neither the fall\r\nof the Tequendama, near Santa Fe de Bogota, nor the magnificent scenes\r\nof the Cordilleras, could weaken the impression produced upon my mind\r\nby the first view of the rapids of Atures and of Maypures. When the\r\nspectator is so stationed that the eye can at once take in the long\r\nsuccession of cataracts, the immense sheet of foam and vapours\r\nillumined by the rays of the setting sun, the whole river seems as it\r\nwere suspended over its bed.\r\n\r\nScenes so astonishing must for ages have fixed the attention of the\r\ninhabitants of the New World. When Diego de Todaz, Alfonzo de Herrera,\r\nand the intrepid Raleigh, anchored at the mouth of the Orinoco, they\r\nwere informed by the Indians of the Great Cataracts, which they\r\nthemselves had never visited, and which they even confounded with\r\ncascades farther to the east. Whatever obstacles the force of\r\nvegetation under the torrid zone may throw in the way of intercourse\r\namong nations, all that relates to the course of great rivers acquires\r\na celebrity which extends to vast distances. The Orinoco, the Amazon,\r\nand the Uruguay, traverse, like inland arms of seas, in different\r\ndirections, a land covered with forests, and inhabited by tribes, part\r\nof whom are cannibals. It is not yet two hundred years since\r\ncivilization and the light of a more humane religion have pursued\r\ntheir way along the banks of these ancient canals traced by the hand\r\nof nature; long, however, before the introduction of agriculture,\r\nbefore communications for the purposes of barter were established\r\namong these scattered and often hostile tribes, the knowledge of\r\nextraordinary phenomena, of falls of water, of volcanic fires, and of\r\nsnows resisting all the ardent heat of summer, was propagated by a\r\nthousand fortuitous circumstances. Three hundred leagues from the\r\ncoast, in the centre of South America, among nations whose excursions\r\ndo not extend to three days' journey, we find an idea of the ocean,\r\nand words that denote a mass of salt water extending as far as the eye\r\ncan discern. Various events, which repeatedly occur in savage life,\r\ncontribute to enlarge these conceptions. In consequence of the petty\r\nwars between neighbouring tribes, a prisoner is brought into a strange\r\ncountry, and treated as a poito or mero, that is to say, as a slave.\r\nAfter being often sold, he is dragged to new wars, escapes, and\r\nreturns home; he relates what he has seen, and what he has heard from\r\nthose whose tongue he has been compelled to learn. As on discovering a\r\ncoast, we hear of great inland animals, so, on entering the valley of\r\na vast river, we are surprised to find that savages, who are strangers\r\nto navigation, have acquired a knowledge of distant things. In the\r\ninfant state of society, the exchange of ideas precedes, to a certain\r\npoint, the exchange of productions.\r\n\r\nThe two great cataracts of the Orinoco, the celebrity of which is so\r\nfar-spread and so ancient, are formed by the passage of the river\r\nacross the mountains of Parima. They are called by the natives Mapara\r\nand Quittuna; but the missionaries have substituted for these names\r\nthose of Atures and Maypures, after the names of the tribes which were\r\nfirst assembled together in the nearest villages. On the coast of\r\nCaracas, the two Great Cataracts are denoted by the simple appellation\r\nof the two Raudales, or rapids; a denomination which implies that the\r\nother falls of water, even the rapids of Camiseta and of Carichana,\r\nare not considered as worthy of attention when compared with the\r\ncataracts of Atures and Maypures.\r\n\r\nThese last, situated between five and six degrees of north latitude,\r\nand a hundred leagues west of the Cordilleras of New Grenada, in the\r\nmeridian of Porto Cabello, are only twelve leagues distant from each\r\nother. It is surprising that their existence was not known to\r\nD'Anville, who, in his fine map of South America, marks the\r\ninconsiderable cascades of Marimara and San Borja, by the names of the\r\nrapids of Carichana and Tabaje. The Great Cataracts divide the\r\nChristian establishments of Spanish Guiana into two unequal parts.\r\nThose situated between the Raudal of Atures and the mouth of the river\r\nare called the Missions of the Lower Orinoco; the Missions of the\r\nUpper Orinoco comprehend the villages between the Raudal of Maypures\r\nand the mountains of Duida. The course of the Lower Orinoco, if we\r\nestimate the sinuosities at one-third of the distance in a direct\r\nline, is two hundred and sixty nautical leagues: the course of the\r\nUpper Orinoco, supposing its sources to be three degrees east of\r\nDuida, includes one hundred and sixty-seven leagues.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Great Cataracts an unknown land begins. The country is\r\npartly mountainous and partly flat, receiving at once the confluents\r\nof the Amazon and the Orinoco. From the facility of its communications\r\nwith the Rio Negro and Grand Para, it appears to belong still more to\r\nBrazil than to the Spanish colonies. None of the missionaries who have\r\ndescribed the Orinoco before me, neither Father Gumilla, Gili, nor\r\nCaulin, had passed the Raudal of Maypures. We found but three\r\nChristian establishments above the Great Cataracts, along the shores\r\nof the Orinoco, in an extent of more than a hundred leagues; and these\r\nthree establishments contained scarcely six or eight white persons,\r\nthat is to say, persons of European race. We cannot be surprised that\r\nsuch a desert region should have been at all times the land of fable\r\nand fairy visions. There, according to the statements of certain\r\nmissionaries, are found races of men, some of whom have an eye in the\r\ncentre of the forehead, whilst others have dogs' heads, and mouths\r\nbelow their stomachs. There they pretend to have found all that the\r\nancients relate of the Garamantes, of the Arimaspes, and of the\r\nHyperboreans. It would be an error to suppose that these simple and\r\noften rustic missionaries had themselves invented all these\r\nexaggerated fictions; they derived them in great part from the\r\nrecitals of the Indians. A fondness for narration prevails in the\r\nMissions, as it does at sea, in the East, and in every place where the\r\nmind seeks amusement. A missionary, from his vocation, is not inclined\r\nto scepticism; he imprints on his memory what the natives have so\r\noften repeated to him; and, when returned to Europe, and restored to\r\nthe civilized world, he finds a pleasure in creating astonishment by a\r\nrecital of facts which he thinks he has collected, and by an animated\r\ndescription of remote things. These stories, which the Spanish\r\ncolonists call tales of travellers and of monks (cuentos de viageros y\r\nfrailes), increase in improbability in proportion as you increase your\r\ndistance from the forests of the Orinoco, and approach the coasts\r\ninhabited by the whites. When, at Cumana, Nueva Barcelona, and other\r\nseaports which have frequent communication with the Missions, you\r\nbetray any sign of incredulity, you are reduced to silence by these\r\nfew words: The fathers have seen it, but far above the Great Cataracts\r\n(mas arriba de los Raudales).\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of April, we left the island of Panumana at four in the\r\nmorning, two hours before sunrise. The sky was in great part obscured,\r\nand lightnings flashed over dense clouds at more than forty degrees of\r\nelevation. We were surprised at not hearing thunder; but possibly this\r\nwas owing to the prodigious height of the storm? It appears to us,\r\nthat in Europe the electric flashes without thunder, vaguely called\r\nheat-lightning, are seen generally nearer the horizon. Under a cloudy\r\nsky, that sent back the radiant caloric of the soil, the heat was\r\nstifling; not a breath of wind agitated the foliage of the trees. The\r\njaguars, as usual, had crossed the arm of the Orinoco by which we were\r\nseparated from the shore, and we heard their cries extremely near.\r\nDuring the night the Indians had advised us to quit our station in the\r\nopen air, and retire to a deserted hut belonging to the conucos of the\r\ninhabitants of Atures. They had taken care to barricade the opening\r\nwith planks, a precaution which seemed to us superfluous; but near the\r\nCataracts tigers are very numerous, and two years before, in these\r\nvery conucos of Panumana, an Indian returning to his hut, towards the\r\nclose of the rainy season, found a tigress settled in it with her two\r\nyoung. These animals had inhabited the dwelling for several months;\r\nthey were dislodged from it with difficulty, and it was only after an\r\nobstinate combat that the former master regained possession of his\r\ndwelling. The jaguars are fond of retiring to deserted ruins, and I\r\nbelieve it is more prudent in general for a solitary traveller to\r\nencamp in the open air, between two fires, than to seek shelter in\r\nuninhabited huts.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the island of Panumana, we perceived on the western bank\r\nof the river the fires of an encampment of Guahibo savages. The\r\nmissionary who accompanied us caused a few musket-shots to be fired in\r\nthe air, which he said would intimidate them, and shew that we were in\r\na state to defend ourselves. The savages most likely had no canoes,\r\nand were not desirous of troubling us in the middle of the river. We\r\npassed at sunrise the mouth of the Rio Anaveni, which descends from\r\nthe eastern mountains. On its banks, now deserted, Father Olmos had\r\nestablished, in the time of the Jesuits, a small village of Japuins or\r\nJaruros. The heat was so excessive that we rested a long time in a\r\nwoody spot, to fish with a hook and line, and it was not without some\r\ntrouble that we carried away all the fish we had caught. We did not\r\narrive till very late at the foot of the Great Cataract, in a bay\r\ncalled the lower harbour (puerto de abaxo); and we followed, not\r\nwithout difficulty, in a dark night, the narrow path that leads to the\r\nMission of Atures, a league distant from the river. We crossed a plain\r\ncovered with large blocks of granite.\r\n\r\nThe little village of San Juan Nepomuceno de los Atures was founded by\r\nthe Jesuit Francisco Gonzales, in 1748. In going up the river this is\r\nthe last of the Christian missions that owe their origin to the order\r\nof St. Ignatius. The more southern establishments, those of Atabapo,\r\nof Cassiquiare, and of Rio Negro, were formed by the fathers of the\r\nObservance of St. Francis. The Orinoco appears to have flowed\r\nheretofore where the village of Atures now stands, and the flat\r\nsavannah that surrounds the village no doubt formed part of the river.\r\nI saw to the east of the mission a succession of rocks, which seemed\r\nto have been the ancient shore of the Orinoco. In the lapse of ages\r\nthe river has been impelled westward, in consequence of the\r\naccumulations of earth, which occur more frequently on the side of the\r\neastern mountains, that are furrowed by torrents. The cataract bears\r\nthe name of Mapara,* as we have mentioned above (* I am ignorant of\r\nthe etymology of this word, which I believe means only a fall of\r\nwater. Gili translates into Maypure a small cascade (raudalito) by\r\nuccamatisi mapara canacapatirri. Should we not spell this word\r\nmatpara? mat being a radical of the Maypure tongue, and meaning bad\r\n(Hervas, Saggio N. 29). The radical par (para) is found among American\r\ntribes more than five hundred leagues distant from each other, the\r\nCaribs, Maypures, Brazilians, and Peruvians, in the words sea, rain,\r\nwater, lake. We must not confound mapara with mapaja; this last word\r\nsignifies, in Maypure and Tamanac, the papaw or melon-tree, no doubt\r\non account of the sweetness of its fruit, for mapa means in the\r\nMaypure, as well as in the Peruvian and Omagua tongues, the honey of\r\nbees. The Tamanacs call a cascade, or raudal, in general uatapurutpe;\r\nthe Maypures, uca.); while the name of the village is derived from\r\nthat of the nation of Atures, now believed to be extinct. I find on\r\nthe maps of the seventeenth century, Island and Cataract of Athule;\r\nwhich is the word Atures written according to the pronunciation of the\r\nTamanacs, who confound, like so many other people, the consonants l\r\nand r. This mountainous region was so little known in Europe, even in\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, that D'Anville, in the first\r\nedition of his South America, makes a branch issue from the Orinoco,\r\nnear Salto de los Atures, and fall into the Amazon, to which branch he\r\ngives the name of Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nEarly maps, as well as Father Gumilla's work, place the Mission in\r\nlatitude 1 degree 30 minutes. Abbe Gili gives it 3 degrees 50 minutes.\r\nI found, by meridian altitudes of Canopus and a of the Southern Cross,\r\n5 degrees 38 minutes 4 seconds for the latitude; and by the\r\nchronometer 4 hours 41 minutes 17 seconds of longitude west of the\r\nmeridian of Paris.\r\n\r\nWe found this small Mission in the most deplorable state. It\r\ncontained, even at the time of the expedition of Solano, commonly\r\ncalled the expedition of the boundaries, three hundred and twenty\r\nIndians. This number had diminished, at the time of our passage by the\r\nCataracts, to forty-seven; and the missionary assured us that this\r\ndiminution became from year to year more sensible. He showed us, that\r\nin the space of thirty-two months only one marriage had been entered\r\nin the registers of the parish church. Two others had been contracted\r\nby uncatechised natives, and celebrated before the Indian Gobernador.\r\nAt the first foundation of the Mission, the Atures, Maypures,\r\nMeyepures, Abanis, and Quirupas, had been assembled together. Instead\r\nof these tribes we found only Guahibos, and a few families of the\r\nnation of Macos. The Atures have almost entirely disappeared; they are\r\nno longer known, except by the tombs in the cavern of Ataruipe, which\r\nrecall to mind the sepulchres of the Guanches at Teneriffe. We learned\r\non the spot, that the Atures, as well as the Quaquas, and the Macos or\r\nPiaroas, belong to the great stock of the Salive nations; while the\r\nMaypures, the Abanis, the Parenis, and the Guaypunaves, are of the\r\nsame race as the Cabres or Caveres, celebrated for their long wars\r\nwith the Caribs. In this labyrinth of petty nations, divided from one\r\nanother as the nations of Latium, Asia Minor, and Sogdiana, formerly\r\nwere, we can trace no general relations but by following the analogy\r\nof tongues. These are the only monuments that have reached us from the\r\nearly ages of the world; the only monuments, which, not being fixed to\r\nthe soil, are at once moveable and lasting, and have as it were\r\ntraversed time and space. They owe their duration, and the extent they\r\noccupy, much less to conquering and polished nations, than to those\r\nwandering and half-savage tribes, who, fleeing before a powerful\r\nenemy, carried along with them in their extreme wretchedness only\r\ntheir wives, their children, and the languages of their fathers.\r\n\r\nBetween the latitudes of 4 and 8 degrees, the Orinoco not only\r\nseparates the great forest of the Parime from the bare savannahs of\r\nthe Apure, Meta, and Guaviare, but also forms the boundary between\r\ntribes of very different manners. To the westward, over treeless\r\nplains, wander the Guahibos, the Chiricoas, and the Guamos; nations,\r\nproud of their savage independence, whom it is difficult to fix to the\r\nsoil, or habituate to regular labour. The Spanish missionaries\r\ncharacterise them well by the name of Indios andantes (errant or\r\nvagabond Indians), because they are perpetually moving from place to\r\nplace. To the east of the Orinoco, between the neighbouring sources of\r\nthe Caura, Cataniapo, and Ventuari, live the Macos, the Salives, the\r\nCuracicanas, Parecas, and Maquiritares, mild, tranquil tribes,\r\naddicted to agriculture, and easily subjected to the discipline of the\r\nMissions. The Indian of the plains differs from the Indian of the\r\nforests in language as well as manners and mental disposition; both\r\nhave an idiom abounding in spirited and bold terms; but the language\r\nof the former is harsher, more concise, and more impassioned; that of\r\nthe latter, softer, more diffuse, and fuller of ambiguous expressions.\r\n\r\nThe Mission of Atures, like most of the Missions of the Orinoco,\r\nsituated between the mouths of the Apure and the Atabapo, is composed\r\nof both the classes of tribes we have just described. We there find\r\nthe Indians of the forests, and the Indians heretofore nomadic*\r\n(Indios monteros and Indios llaneros, or andantes). (* I employ the\r\nword nomadic as synonymous with wandering, and not in its primitive\r\nsignification. The wandering nations of America (those of the\r\nindigenous tribes, it is to be understood) are never shepherds; they\r\nlive by fishing and hunting, on the fruit of a few trees, the\r\nfarinaceous pith of palm-trees, etc.) We visited with the missionary\r\nthe huts of Macos, whom the Spaniards call Piraoas, and those of the\r\nGuahibos. The first indicated more love of order, cleanliness, and\r\nease. The independent Macos (I do not designate them by the name of\r\nsavages) have their rochelas, or fixed dwellings, two or three days'\r\njourney east of Atures, toward the sources of the little river\r\nCataniapo. They are very numerous. Like most of the natives of the\r\nwoods, they cultivate, not maize, but cassava; and they live in great\r\nharmony with the Christian Indians of the mission. The harmony was\r\nestablished and wisely cultivated by the Franciscan monk, Bernardo\r\nZea. This alcalde of the reduced Macos quitted the village of Atures\r\nfor a few months every year, to live in the plantations which he\r\npossessed in the midst of the forests near the hamlet of the\r\nindependent Macos. In consequence of this peaceful intercourse, many\r\nof the Indios monteros came and established themselves some time ago\r\nin the mission. They asked eagerly for knives, fishing hooks, and\r\nthose coloured glass beads, which, notwithstanding the positive\r\nprohibition of the priests, were employed not as necklaces, but as\r\nornaments of the guayuco (perizoma). Having obtained what they sought,\r\nthey returned to the woods, weary of the regulations of the mission.\r\nEpidemic fevers, which prevailed with violence at the entrance of the\r\nrainy season, contributed greatly to this unexpected flight. In 1799\r\nthe mortality was very considerable at Carichana, on the banks of the\r\nMeta, and at the Raudal of Atures. The Indian of the forest conceives\r\na horror of the life of the civilized man, when, I will not say any\r\nmisfortune befalls his family settled in the mission, but merely any\r\ndisagreeable or unforeseen accident. Natives, who were neophytes, have\r\nbeen known to desert for ever the Christian establishments, on account\r\nof a great drought; as if this calamity would not have reached them\r\nequally in their plantations, had they remained in their primitive\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThe fevers which prevail during a great part of the year in the\r\nvillages of Atures and Maypures, around the two Great Cataracts of the\r\nOrinoco, render these spots highly dangerous to European travellers.\r\nThey are caused by violent heats, in combination with the excessive\r\nhumidity of the air, bad nutriment, and, if we may believe the\r\nnatives, the pestilent exhalations rising from the bare rocks of the\r\nRaudales. These fevers of the Orinoco appeared to us to resemble those\r\nwhich prevail every year between New Barcelona, La Guayra, and Porto\r\nCabello, in the vicinity of the sea; and which often degenerate into\r\nadynamic fevers. \"I have had my little fever (mi calenturita) only\r\neight months,\" said the good missionary of the Atures, who accompanied\r\nus to the Rio Negro; speaking of it as of an habitual evil, easy to be\r\nborne. The fits were violent, but of short duration. He was sometimes\r\nseized with them when lying along in the boat under a shelter of\r\nbranches of trees, sometimes when exposed to the burning rays of the\r\nsun on an open beach. These tertian agues are attended with great\r\ndebility of the muscular system; yet we find poor ecclesiastics on the\r\nOrinoco, who endure for several years these calenturitas, or\r\ntercianas: their effects are not so fatal as those which are\r\nexperienced from fevers of much shorter duration in temperate\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nI have just alluded to the noxious influence on the salubrity of the\r\natmosphere, which is attributed by the natives, and even the\r\nmissionaries, to the bare rocks. This opinion is the more worthy of\r\nattention, as it is connected with a physical phenomenon lately\r\nobserved in different parts of the globe, and not yet sufficiently\r\nexplained. Among the cataracts, and wherever the Orinoco, between the\r\nMissions of Carichana and of Santa Barbara, periodically washes the\r\ngranitic rocks, they become smooth, black, and as if coated with\r\nplumbago. The colouring matter does not penetrate the stone, which is\r\ncoarse-grained granite, containing a few solitary crystals of\r\nhornblende. Taking a general view of the primitive formation of\r\nAtures, we perceive, that, like the granite of Syene in Egypt, it is a\r\ngranite with hornblende, and not a real syenite formation. Many of the\r\nlayers are entirely destitute of hornblende. The black crust is 0.3 of\r\na line in thickness; it is found chiefly on the quartzose parts. The\r\ncrystals of feldspar sometimes preserve externally their reddish-white\r\ncolour, and rise above the black crust. On breaking the stone with a\r\nhammer, the inside is found to be white, and without any trace of\r\ndecomposition. These enormous stony masses appear sometimes in rhombs,\r\nsometimes under those hemispheric forms, peculiar to granitic rocks\r\nwhen they separate in blocks. They give the landscape a singularly\r\ngloomy aspect; their colour being in strong contrast with that of the\r\nfoam of the river which covers them, and of the vegetation by which\r\nthey are surrounded. The Indians say, that the rocks are burnt (or\r\ncarbonized) by the rays of the sun. We saw them not only in the bed of\r\nthe Orinoco, but in some spots as far as five hundred toises from its\r\npresent shore, on heights which the waters now never reach even in\r\ntheir greatest swellings.\r\n\r\nWhat is this brownish black crust, which gives these rocks, when they\r\nhave a globular form, the appearance of meteoric stones? What idea can\r\nwe form of the action of the water, which produces a deposit, or a\r\nchange of colour, so extraordinary? We must observe, in the first\r\nplace, that this phenomenon does not belong to the cataracts of the\r\nOrinoco alone, but is found in both hemispheres. At my return from\r\nMexico in 1807, when I showed the granites of Atures and Maypures to\r\nM. Roziere, who had travelled over the valley of Egypt, the coasts of\r\nthe Red Sea, and Mount Sinai, this learned geologist pointed out to me\r\nthat the primitive rocks of the little cataracts of Syene display,\r\nlike the rocks of the Orinoco, a glossy surface, of a blackish-grey,\r\nor almost leaden colour, and of which some of the fragments seem\r\ncoated with tar. Recently, in the unfortunate expedition of Captain\r\nTuckey, the English naturalists were struck with the same appearance\r\nin the yellalas (rapids and shoals) that obstruct the river Congo or\r\nZaire. Dr. Koenig has placed in the British Museum, beside the\r\nsyenites of the Congo, the granites of Atures, taken from a series of\r\nrocks which were presented by M. Bonpland and myself to the\r\nillustrious president of the Royal Society of London. \"These\r\nfragments,\" says Mr. Koenig, \"alike resemble meteoric stones; in both\r\nrocks, those of the Orinoco and of Africa, the black crust is\r\ncomposed, according to the analysis of Mr. Children, of the oxide of\r\niron and manganese.\" Some experiments made at Mexico, conjointly with\r\nSenor del Rio, led me to think that the rocks of Atures, which blacken\r\nthe paper in which they are wrapped,* contain, besides oxide of\r\nmanganese, carbon, and supercarburetted iron. (* I remarked the same\r\nphenomenon from spongy grains of platina one or two lines in length,\r\ncollected at the stream-works of Taddo, in the province of Choco.\r\nHaving been wrapped up in white paper during a journey of several\r\nmonths, they left a black stain, like that of plumbago or\r\nsupercarburetted iron.) At the Orinoco, granitic masses of forty or\r\nfifty feet thick are uniformly coated with these oxides; and, however\r\nthin these crusts may appear, they must nevertheless contain pretty\r\nconsiderable quantities of iron and manganese, since they occupy a\r\nspace of above a league square.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that all these phenomena of coloration have\r\nhitherto appeared in the torrid zone only, in rivers that have\r\nperiodical overflowings, of which the habitual temperature is from\r\ntwenty-four to twenty-eight centesimal degrees, and which flow, not\r\nover gritstone or calcareous rocks, but over granite, gneiss, and\r\nhornblende rocks. Quartz and feldspar scarcely contain five or six\r\nthousandths of oxide of iron and of manganese; but in mica and\r\nhornblende these oxides, and particularly that of iron, amount,\r\naccording to Klaproth and Herrmann, to fifteen or twenty parts in a\r\nhundred. The hornblende contains also some carbon, like the Lydian\r\nstone and kieselschiefer. Now, if these black crusts were formed by a\r\nslow decomposition of the granitic rock, under the double influence of\r\nhumidity and the tropical sun, how is it to be conceived that these\r\noxides are spread so uniformly over the whole surface of the stony\r\nmasses, and are not more abundant round a crystal of mica or\r\nhornblende than on the feldspar and milky quartz? The ferruginous\r\nsandstones, granites, and marbles, that become cinereous and sometimes\r\nbrown in damp air, have an aspect altogether different. In reflecting\r\nupon the lustre and equal thickness of the crusts, we are rather\r\ninclined to think that this matter is deposited by the Orinoco, and\r\nthat the water has penetrated even into the clefts of the rocks.\r\nAdopting this hypothesis, it may be asked whether the river holds the\r\noxides suspended like sand and other earthy substances, or whether\r\nthey are found in a state of chemical solution. The first supposition\r\nis less admissible, on account of the homogeneity of the crusts, which\r\ncontain neither grains of sand, nor spangles of mica, mixed with the\r\noxides. We must then recur to the idea of a chemical solution; and\r\nthis idea is no way at variance with the phenomena daily observable in\r\nour laboratories. The waters of great rivers contain carbonic acid;\r\nand, were they even entirely pure, they would still be capable, in\r\nvery great volumes, of dissolving some portions of oxide, or those\r\nmetallic hydrates which are regarded as the least soluble. The mud of\r\nthe Nile, which is the sediment of the matters which the river holds\r\nsuspended, is destitute of manganese; but it contains, according to\r\nthe analysis of M. Regnault, six parts in a hundred of oxide of iron;\r\nand its colour, at first black, changes to yellowish brown by\r\ndesiccation and the contact of air. The mud consequently is not the\r\ncause of the black crusts on the rocks of Syene. Berzelius, who, at my\r\nrequest, examined these crusts, recognized in them, as in those of the\r\ngranites of the Orinoco and River Congo, the union of iron and\r\nmanganese. That celebrated chemist was of opinion that the rivers do\r\nnot take up these oxides from the soil over which they flow, but that\r\nthey derive them from their subterranean sources, and deposit them on\r\nthe rocks in the manner of cementation, by the action of particular\r\naffinities, perhaps by that of the potash of the feldspar. A long\r\nresidence at the cataracts of the Orinoco, the Nile, and the Rio\r\nCongo, and an examination of the circumstances attendant on this\r\nphenomenon of coloration, could alone lead to the complete solution of\r\nthe problem we have discussed. Is this phenomenon independent of the\r\nnature of the rocks? I shall content myself with observing, in\r\ngeneral, that neither the granitic masses remote from the ancient bed\r\nof the Orinoco, but exposed during the rainy season to the\r\nalternations of heat and moisture, nor the granitic rocks bathed by\r\nthe brownish waters of the Rio Negro, assume the appearance of\r\nmeteoric stones. The Indians say, that the rocks are black only where\r\nthe waters are white. They ought, perhaps, to add, where the waters\r\nacquire great swiftness, and strike with force against the rocks of\r\nthe banks. Cementation seems to explain why the crusts augment so\r\nlittle in thickness.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it be an error, but in the Missions of the Orinoco,\r\nthe neighbourhood of bare rocks, and especially of the masses that\r\nhave crusts of carbon, oxide of iron, and manganese, are considered\r\ninjurious to health. In the torrid zone, still more than in others,\r\nthe people multiply pathogenic causes at will. They are afraid to\r\nsleep in the open air, if forced to expose the face to the rays of the\r\nfull moon. They also think it dangerous to sleep on granite near the\r\nriver; and many examples are cited of persons, who, after having\r\npassed the night on these black and naked rocks, have awakened in the\r\nmorning with a strong paroxysm of fever. Without entirely lending\r\nfaith to the assertions of the missionaries and natives, we generally\r\navoided the laxas negras, and stretched ourselves on the beach covered\r\nwith white sand, when we found no tree from which to suspend our\r\nhammocks. At Carichana, the village is intended to be destroyed, and\r\nits place changed, merely to remove it from the black rocks, or from a\r\nsite where, for a space of more than ten thousand square toises, banks\r\nof bare granite form the surface. From similar motives, which must\r\nappear very chimerical to the naturalists of Europe, the Jesuits Olmo,\r\nForneri, and Mellis, removed a village of Jaruros to three different\r\nspots, between the Raudal of Tabaje and the Rio Anaveni. I merely\r\nstate these facts as they were related to me, because we are almost\r\nwholly ignorant of the nature of the gaseous mixtures which cause the\r\ninsalubrity of the atmosphere. Can it be admitted that, under the\r\ninfluence of excessive heat and of constant humidity, the black crusts\r\nof the granitic rocks are capable of acting upon the ambient air, and\r\nproducing miasmata with a triple basis of carbon, azote, and hydrogen?\r\nThis I doubt. The granites of the Orinoco, it is true, often contain\r\nhornblende; and those who are accustomed to practical labour in mines\r\nare not ignorant that the most noxious exhalations rise from galleries\r\nwrought in syenitic and hornblende rocks: but in an atmosphere renewed\r\nevery instant by the action of little currents of air, the effect\r\ncannot be the same as in a mine.\r\n\r\nIt is probably dangerous to sleep on the laxas negras, only because\r\nthese rocks retain a very elevated temperature during the night. I\r\nhave found their temperature in the day at 48 degrees, the air in the\r\nshade being at 29.7 degrees; during the night the thermometer on the\r\nrock indicated 36 degrees, the air being at 26 degrees. When the\r\naccumulation of heat in the stony masses has reached a stationary\r\ndegree, these masses become at the same hours nearly of the same\r\ntemperature. What they have acquired more in the day they lose at\r\nnight by radiation, the force of which depends on the state of the\r\nsurface of the radiating body, the interior arrangement of its\r\nparticles, and, above all, on the clearness of the sky, that is, on\r\nthe transparency of the atmosphere and the absence of clouds. When the\r\ndeclination of the sun varies very little, this luminary adds daily\r\nnearly the same quantities of heat, and the rocks are not hotter at\r\nthe end than in the middle of summer. There is a certain maximum which\r\nthey cannot pass, because they do not change the state of their\r\nsurface, their density, or their capacity for caloric. On the shores\r\nof the Orinoco, on getting out of one's hammock during the night, and\r\ntouching with the bare feet the rocky surface of the ground, the\r\nsensation of heat experienced is very remarkable. I observed pretty\r\nconstantly, in putting the bulb of the thermometer in contact with the\r\nledges of bare rocks, that the laxas negras are hotter during the day\r\nthan the reddish-white granites at a distance from the river; but the\r\nlatter cool during the night less rapidly than the former. It may be\r\neasily conceived that the emission and loss of caloric is more rapid\r\nin masses with black crusts than in those which abound in laminae of\r\nsilvery mica. When walking between the hours of one and three in the\r\nafternoon, at Carichana, Atures, or Maypures, among those blocks of\r\nstone destitute of vegetable mould, and piled up to great heights, one\r\nfeels a sensation of suffocation, as if standing before the opening of\r\na furnace. The winds, if ever felt in those woody regions, far from\r\nbringing coolness, appear more heated when they have passed over beds\r\nof stone, and heaps of rounded blocks of granite. This augmentation of\r\nheat adds to the insalubrity of the climate.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of the depopulation of the Raudales, I have not\r\nreckoned the small-pox, that malady which in other parts of America\r\nmakes such cruel ravages that the natives, seized with dismay, burn\r\ntheir huts, kill their children, and renounce every kind of society.\r\nThis scourge is almost unknown on the banks of the Orinoco, and should\r\nit penetrate thither, it is to be hoped that its effects may be\r\nimmediately counteracted by vaccination, the blessings of which are\r\ndaily felt along the coasts of Terra Firma. The causes which\r\ndepopulate the Christian settlements are, the repugnance of the\r\nIndians for the regulations of the missions, insalubrity of climate,\r\nbad nourishment, want of care in the diseases of children, and the\r\nguilty practice of preventing pregnancy by the use of deleterious\r\nherbs. Among the barbarous people of Guiana, as well as those of the\r\nhalf-civilized islands of the South Sea, young wives are fearful of\r\nbecoming mothers. If they have children, their offspring are exposed\r\nnot only to the dangers of savage life, but also to other dangers\r\narising from the strangest popular prejudices. When twins are born,\r\nfalse notions of propriety and family honour require that one of them\r\nshould be destroyed. To bring twins into the world, say the Indians,\r\nis to be exposed to public scorn; it is to resemble rats, opossums,\r\nand the vilest animals, which bring forth a great number of young at a\r\ntime. Nay, more, they affirm that two children born at the same time\r\ncannot belong to the same father. This is an axiom of physiology among\r\nthe Salives; and in every zone, and in different states of society,\r\nwhen the vulgar seize upon an axiom, they adhere to it with more\r\nstedfastness than the better-informed men by whom it was first\r\nhazarded. To avoid the disturbance of conjugal tranquillity, the old\r\nfemale relations of the mother take care, that when twins are born one\r\nof them shall disappear. If a new-born infant, though not a twin, have\r\nany physical deformity, the father instantly puts it to death. They\r\nwill have none but robust and well-made children, for deformities\r\nindicate some influence of the evil spirit Ioloquiamo, or the bird\r\nTikitiki, the enemy of the human race. Sometimes children of a feeble\r\nconstitution undergo the same fate. When the father is asked what is\r\nbecome of one of his sons, he will pretend that he has lost him by a\r\nnatural death. He will disavow an action that appears to him\r\nblameable, but not criminal. \"The poor boy,\" he will tell you, \"could\r\nnot follow us; we must have waited for him every moment; he has not\r\nbeen seen again; he did not come to sleep where we passed the night.\"\r\nSuch is the candour and simplicity of manners--such the boasted\r\nhappiness--of man in the state of nature! He kills his son to escape\r\nthe ridicule of having twins, or to avoid journeying more slowly; in\r\nfact, to avoid a little inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThese acts of cruelty, I confess, are less frequent than they are\r\nbelieved to be; yet they occur even in the Missions, during the time\r\nwhen the Indians leave the village, to retire to the conucos of the\r\nneighbouring forests. It would be erroneous to attribute these actions\r\nto the state of polygamy in which the uncatechized Indians live.\r\nPolygamy no doubt diminishes the domestic happiness and internal union\r\nof families; but this practice, sanctioned by Ismaelism, does not\r\nprevent the people of the east from loving their children with\r\ntenderness. Among the Indians of the Orinoco, the father returns home\r\nonly to eat, or to sleep in his hammock; he lavishes no caresses on\r\nhis infants, or on his wives, whose office it is to serve him.\r\nParental affection begins to display itself only when the son has\r\nbecome strong enough to take a part in hunting, fishing, and the\r\nagricultural labours of the plantations.\r\n\r\nWhile our boat was unloading, we examined closely, wherever the shore\r\ncould be approached, the terrific spectacle of a great river narrowed\r\nand reduced as it were to foam. I shall endeavour to paint, not the\r\nsensations we felt, but the aspect of a spot so celebrated among the\r\nscenes of the New World. The more imposing and majestic the objects we\r\ndescribe, the more essential it becomes to seize them in their\r\nsmallest details, to fix the outline of the picture we would present\r\nto the imagination of the reader, and to describe with simplicity what\r\ncharacterises the great and imperishable monuments of nature.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of the Orinoco from its mouth as far as the confluence\r\nof the Anaveni, an extent of 260 leagues, is not impeded. There are\r\nshoals and eddies near Muitaco, in a cove that bears the name of the\r\nMouth of Hell (Boca del Infierno); and there are rapids (raudalitos)\r\nnear Carichana and San Borja; but in all these places the river is\r\nnever entirely barred, as a channel is left by which boats can pass up\r\nand down.\r\n\r\nIn all this navigation of the Lower Orinoco travellers experience no\r\nother danger than that of the natural rafts formed by trees, which are\r\nuprooted by the river, and swept along in its great floods. Woe to the\r\ncanoes that during the night strike against these rafts of wood\r\ninterwoven with lianas! Covered with aquatic plants, they resemble\r\nhere, as in the Mississippi, floating meadows, the chinampas or\r\nfloating gardens of the Mexican lakes. The Indians, when they wish to\r\nsurprise a tribe of their enemies, bring together several canoes,\r\nfasten them to each other with cords, and cover them with grass and\r\nbranches, to imitate this assemblage of trunks of trees, which the\r\nOrinoco sweeps along in its middle current. The Caribs are accused of\r\nhaving heretofore excelled in the use of this artifice; at present the\r\nSpanish smugglers in the neighbourhood of Angostura have recourse to\r\nthe same expedient to escape the vigilance of the custom-house\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding up the Orinoco beyond the Rio Anaveni, we find,\r\nbetween the mountains of Uniana and Sipapu, the Great Cataracts of\r\nMapara and Quittuna, or, as they are more commonly called by the\r\nmissionaries, the Raudales of Atures and Maypures. These bars, which\r\nextend from one bank to the other, present in general a similar\r\naspect: they are composed of innumerable islands, dikes of rock, and\r\nblocks of granite piled on one another and covered with palm-trees.\r\nBut, notwithstanding a uniformity of aspect, each of these cataracts\r\npreserves an individual character. The first, the Atures, is most\r\neasily passable when the waters are low. The Indians prefer crossing\r\nthe second, the Maypures, at the time of great floods. Beyond the\r\nMaypures and the mouth of the Cano Cameji, the Orinoco is again\r\nunobstructed for the length of more than one hundred and sixty-seven\r\nleagues, or nearly to its source; that is to say, as far as the\r\nRaudalito of Guaharibos, east of the Cano Chiguire and the lofty\r\nmountains of Yumariquin.\r\n\r\nHaving visited the basins of the two rivers Orinoco and Amazon, I was\r\nsingularly struck by the differences they display in their course of\r\nunequal extent. The falls of the Amazon, which is nearly nine hundred\r\nand eighty nautical leagues (twenty to a degree) in length, are pretty\r\nnear its source in the first sixth of its total length, and\r\nfive-sixths of its course are entirely free. We find the great falls\r\nof the Orinoco on a point far more unfavourable to navigation; if not\r\nat the half, at least much beyond the first third of its length. In\r\nboth rivers it is neither the mountains, nor the different stages of\r\nflat lands lying over one another, whence they take their origin, that\r\ncause the cataracts; they are produced by other mountains, other\r\nledges which, after a long and tranquil course, the rivers have to\r\npass over, precipitating themselves from step to step.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon does not pierce its way through the principal chain of the\r\nAndes, as was affirmed at a period when it was gratuitously supposed\r\nthat, wherever mountains are divided into parallel chains, the\r\nintermedial or central ridge must be more elevated than the others.\r\nThis great river rises (and this is a point of some importance to\r\ngeology) eastward of the western chain, which alone in this latitude\r\nmerits the denomination of the high chain of the Andes. It is formed\r\nby the junction of the river Aguamiros with the Rio Chavinillo, which\r\nissues from the lake Llauricocha in a longitudinal valley bounded by\r\nthe western and the intermedial chain of the Andes. To form an\r\naccurate idea of these hydrographical relations, it must be borne in\r\nmind that a division into three chains takes place in the colossal\r\ngroup or knot of the mountains of Pasco and Huanuco. The western\r\nchain, which is the loftiest, and takes the name of the Cordillera\r\nReal de Nieve, directs its course (between Huary and Caxatamba,\r\nGuamachuco and Luema, Micuipampa and Guangamarca) by the Nevados of\r\nViuda, Pelagatos, Moyopata, and Huaylillas, and by the Paramos of\r\nGuamani and Guaringa, towards the town of Loxa. The intermedial chain\r\nseparates the waters of the Upper Maranon from those of the Guallaga,\r\nand over a long space reaches only the small elevation of a thousand\r\ntoises; it enters the region of perpetual snow to the south of Huanuco\r\nin the Cordillera of Sasaguanca. It stretches at first northward by\r\nHuacrachuco, Chachapoyas, Moyobamba, and the Paramo of Piscoguannuna;\r\nthen it progressively lowers toward Peca, Copallin, and the Mission of\r\nSantiago, at the eastern extremity of the province of Jaen de\r\nBracamoros. The third, or easternmost chain, skirts the right bank of\r\nthe Rio Guallaga, and loses itself in the seventh degree of latitude.\r\nSo long as the Amazon flows from south to north in the longitudinal\r\nvalley, between two chains of unequal height (that is, from the farms\r\nof Quivilla and Guancaybamba, where the river is crossed on wooden\r\nbridges, as far as the confluence of the Rio Chinchipe), there are\r\nneither bars, nor any obstacle whatever to the navigation of boats.\r\nThe falls of water begin only where the Amazon turns toward the east,\r\ncrossing the intermedial chain of the Andes, which widens considerably\r\ntoward the north. It meets with the first rocks of red sandstone, or\r\nancient conglomerate, between Tambillo and the Pongo of Rentema (near\r\nwhich I measured the breadth, depth, and swiftness of the waters), and\r\nit leaves the rocks of red sandstone east of the famous strait of\r\nManseriche, near the Pongo of Tayuchuc, where the hills rise no higher\r\nthan forty or fifty toises above the level of its waters. The river\r\ndoes not reach the most easterly chain, which bounds the Pampas del\r\nSacramento. From the hills of Tayuchuc as far as Grand Para, during a\r\ncourse of more than seven hundred and fifty leagues, the navigation is\r\nfree from obstacles. It results from this rapid sketch, that, if the\r\nMaranon had not to pass over the hilly country between Santiago and\r\nTomependa (which belongs to the central chain of the Andes) it would\r\nbe navigable from its mouth as far as Pumpo, near Piscobamba in the\r\nprovince of Conchucos, forty-three leagues north of its source.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that, in the Orinoco, as in the Amazon, the great\r\ncataracts are not found near the sources of the rivers. After a\r\ntranquil course of more than one hundred and sixty leagues from the\r\nlittle Raudal of Guaharibos, east of Esmeralda, as far as the\r\nmountains of Sipapu, the river, augmented by the waters of the Jao,\r\nthe Ventuari, the Atabapo, and the Guaviare, suddenly changes its\r\nprimitive direction from east to west, and runs from south to north:\r\nthen, in crossing the land-strait* in the plains of Meta, (* This\r\nstrait, which I have several times mentioned, is formed by the\r\nCordilleras of the Andes of New Granada, and the Cordillera of\r\nParima.) meets the advanced buttresses of the Cordillera of Parima.\r\nThis obstacle causes cataracts far more considerable, and presents\r\ngreater impediments to navigation, than all the Pongos of the Upper\r\nMaranon, because they are proportionally nearer to the mouth of the\r\nriver. These geographical details serve to prove, in the instances of\r\nthe two greatest rivers of the New World, first, that it cannot be\r\nascertained in an absolute manner that, beyond a certain number of\r\ntoises, or a certain height above the level of the sea, rivers are not\r\nnavigable; secondly, that the rapids are not always occasioned, as\r\nseveral treatises of general topography affirm, by the height of the\r\nfirst obstacles, by the first lines of ridges which the waters have to\r\nsurmount near their sources.\r\n\r\nThe most northern of the great cataracts of the Orinoco is the only\r\none bounded on each side by lofty mountains. The left bank of the\r\nriver is generally lower, but it makes part of a plane which rises\r\nagain west of Atures, towards the Peak of Uniana, a pyramid nearly\r\nthree thousand feet high, and placed on a wall of rock with steep\r\nslopes. The situation of this solitary peak in the plain contributes\r\nto render its aspect more imposing and majestic. Near the Mission, in\r\nthe country which surrounds the cataract, the aspect of the landscape\r\nvaries at every step. Within a small space we find all that is most\r\nrude and gloomy in nature, united with an open country and lovely\r\npastoral scenery. In the physical, as in the moral world, the contrast\r\nof effects, the comparison of what is powerful and menacing with what\r\nis soft and peaceful, is a never-failing source of our pleasures and\r\nour emotions.\r\n\r\nI shall here repeat some scattered features of a picture which I\r\ntraced in another work shortly after my return to Europe.* (* Views of\r\nNature page 153 Bohn's edition.) The savannahs of Atures, covered with\r\nslender plants and grasses, are really meadows resembling those of\r\nEurope. They are never inundated by the rivers, and seem as if waiting\r\nto be ploughed by the hand of man. Notwithstanding their extent, these\r\nsavannahs do not exhibit the monotony of our plains; they surround\r\ngroups of rocks and blocks of granite piled on one another. On the\r\nvery borders of these plains and this open country, glens are seen\r\nscarcely lighted by the rays of the setting sun, and hollows where the\r\nhumid soil, loaded with arums, heliconias, and lianas, manifests at\r\nevery step the wild fecundity of nature. Everywhere, just rising above\r\nthe earth, appear those shelves of granite completely bare, which we\r\nsaw at Carichana, and which I have already described. Where springs\r\ngush from the bosom of these rocks, verrucarias, psoras, and lichens\r\nare fixed on the decomposed granite, and have there accumulated mould.\r\nLittle euphorbias, peperomias, and other succulent plants, have taken\r\nthe place of the cryptogamous tribes; and evergreen shrubs, rhexias,\r\nand purple-flowered melastomas, form verdant isles amid desert and\r\nrocky plains. The distribution of these spots, the clusters of small\r\ntrees with coriaceous and shining leaves scattered in the savannahs,\r\nthe limpid rills that dig channels across the rocks, and wind\r\nalternately through fertile places and over bare shelves of granite,\r\nall call to mind the most lovely and picturesque plantations and\r\npleasure-grounds of Europe. We seem to recognise the industry of man,\r\nand the traces of cultivation, amid this wild scenery.\r\n\r\nThe lofty mountains that bound the horizon on every side, contribute\r\nalso, by their forms and the nature of their vegetation, to give an\r\nextraordinary character to the landscape. The average height of these\r\nmountains is not more than seven or eight hundred feet above the\r\nsurrounding plains. Their summits are rounded, as for the most part in\r\ngranitic mountains, and covered with thick forests of the\r\nlaurel-tribe. Clusters of palm-trees,* (* El cucurito.) the leaves of\r\nwhich, curled like feathers, rise majestically at an angle of seventy\r\ndegrees, are dispersed amid trees with horizontal branches; and their\r\nbare trunks, like columns of a hundred or a hundred and twenty feet\r\nhigh, shoot up into the air, and when seen in distinct relief against\r\nthe azure vault of the sky, they resemble a forest planted upon\r\nanother forest. When, as the moon was going down behind the mountains\r\nof Uniana, her reddish disc was hidden behind the pinnated foliage of\r\nthe palm-trees, and again appeared in the aerial zone that separates\r\nthe two forests, I thought myself transported for a few moments to the\r\nhermitage which Bernardin de Saint-Pierre has described as one of the\r\nmost delicious scenes of the Isle of Bourbon, and I felt how much the\r\naspect of the plants and their groupings resembled each other in the\r\ntwo worlds. In describing a small spot of land in an island of the\r\nIndian Ocean, the inimitable author of Paul and Virginia has sketched\r\nthe vast picture of the landscape of the tropics. He knew how to paint\r\nnature, not because he had studied it scientifically, but because he\r\nfelt it in all its harmonious analogies of forms, colours, and\r\ninterior powers.\r\n\r\nEast of the Atures, near these rounded mountains crowned, as it were,\r\nby two superimposed forests of laurels and palms, other mountains of a\r\nvery different aspect arise. Their ridge is bristled with pointed\r\nrocks, towering like pillars above the summits of the trees and\r\nshrubs. These effects are common to all granitic table-lands, at the\r\nHarz, in the metalliferous mountains of Bohemia, in Galicia, on the\r\nlimit of the two Castiles, or wherever a granite of new formation\r\nappears above the ground. The rocks, which are at distances from each\r\nother, are composed of blocks piled together, or divided into regular\r\nand horizontal beds. On the summits of those situated near the\r\nOrinoco, flamingos, soldados,* (* The soldado (soldier) is a large\r\nspecies of heron.) and other fishing-birds perch, and look like men\r\nposted as sentinels. This resemblance is so striking, that the\r\ninhabitants of Angostura, soon after the foundation of their city,\r\nwere one day alarmed by the sudden appearance of soldados and garzas,\r\non a mountain towards the south. They believed they were menaced with\r\nan attack of Indios monteros (wild Indians called mountaineers); and\r\nthe people were not perfectly tranquilized, till they saw the birds\r\nsoaring in the air, and continuing their migration towards the mouths\r\nof the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe fine vegetation of the mountains spreads over the plains, wherever\r\nthe rock is covered with mould, We generally find that this black\r\nmould, mixed with fibrous vegetable matter, is separated from the\r\ngranitic rock by a layer of white sand. The missionary assured us that\r\nverdure of perpetual freshness prevails in the vicinity of the\r\ncataracts, produced by the quantity of vapour which the river, broken\r\ninto torrents and cascades for the length of three or four thousand\r\ntoises, diffuses in the air.\r\n\r\nWe had not heard thunder more than once or twice at Atures, and the\r\nvegetation everywhere displayed that vigorous aspect, that brilliancy\r\nof colour, seen on the coast only at the end of the rainy season. The\r\nold trees were decorated with beautiful orchideas,* (* Cymbidium\r\nviolaceum, Habenaria angustifolia, etc.) yellow bannisterias,\r\nblue-flowered bignonias, peperomias, arums, and pothoses. A single\r\ntrunk displays a greater variety of vegetable forms than are contained\r\nwithin an extensive space of ground in our countries. Close to the\r\nparasite plants peculiar to very hot climates we observed, not without\r\nsurprise, in the centre of the torrid zone, and near the level of the\r\nsea, mosses resembling in every respect those of Europe. We gathered,\r\nnear the Great Cataract of Atures, that fine specimen of Grimmia* with\r\nfontinalis leaves, which has so much fixed the attention of botanists.\r\n(* Grimmia fontinaloides. See Hooker's Musci Exotici, 1818 tab. 2. The\r\nlearned author of the Monography of the Jungermanniae (Mr. Jackson\r\nHooker), with noble disinterestedness, published at his own expense,\r\nin London, the whole collection of cryptogamous plants, brought by\r\nBonpland and Humboldt from the equinoctial regions of America.) It is\r\nsuspended to the branches of the loftiest trees. Of the phaenerogamous\r\nplants, those which prevail in the woody spots are the mimosa, ficus,\r\nand laurinea. This fact is the more characteristic as, according to\r\nthe observations of Mr. Brown, the laurineae appear to be almost\r\nentirely wanting on the opposite continent, in the equinoctial part of\r\nAfrica. Plants that love humidity adorn the scenery surrounding the\r\ncataracts. We there find in the plains groups of heliconias and other\r\nscitamineae with large and glossy leaves, bamboos, and the three\r\npalm-trees, the murichi, jagua, and vadgiai, each of which forms a\r\nseparate group. The murichi, or mauritia with scaly fruits, is the\r\ncelebrated sago-tree of the Guaraon Indians. It has palmate leaves,\r\nand has no relation to the palm-trees with pinnate and curled leaves;\r\nto the jagua, which appears to be a species of the cocoa-tree; or to\r\nthe vadgiai or cucurito, which may be assimilated to the fine species\r\nOreodoxa. The cucurito, which is the palm most prevalent around the\r\ncataracts of the Atures and Maypures, is remarkable for its\r\nstateliness. Its leaves, or rather its palms, crown a trunk of eighty\r\nor one hundred feet high; their direction is almost perpendicular when\r\nyoung, as well as at their full growth, the points only being\r\nincurvated. They look like plumes of the most soft and verdant green.\r\nThe cucurito, the pirijao, the fruit of which resembles the apricot,\r\nthe Oreodoxa regia or palma real of the island of Cuba, and the\r\nceroxylon of the high Andes, are the most majestic of all the\r\npalm-trees we saw in the New World. As we advance toward the temperate\r\nzone, the plants of this family decrease in size and beauty. What a\r\ndifference between the species we have just mentioned, and the\r\ndate-tree of the East, which unfortunately has become to the landscape\r\npainters of Europe the type of a group of palm-trees!\r\n\r\nIt is not suprising that persons who have travelled only in the north\r\nof Africa, in Sicily, or in Spain, cannot conceive that, of all large\r\ntrees, the palm is the most grand and beautiful in form. Incomplete\r\nanalogies prevent Europeans from having a just idea of the aspect of\r\nthe torrid zone. All the world knows, for instance, that this zone is\r\nembellished by the contrasts exhibited in the foliage of the trees,\r\nand particularly by the great number of those with pinnate leaves. The\r\nash, the service-tree, the inga, the acacia of the United States, the\r\ngleditsia, the tamarind, the mimosa, the desmanthus, have all pinnate\r\nleaves, with foliolae more or less long, slender, tough, and shining.\r\nBut can a group of ash-trees, of service-trees, or of sumach, recall\r\nthe picturesque effect of tamarinds or mimosas, when the azure of the\r\nsky appears through their small, slender, and delicately pinnated\r\nleaves? These considerations are more important than they may at first\r\nseem. The forms of plants determine the physiognomy of nature; and\r\nthis physiognomy influences the moral dispositions of nations. Every\r\ntype comprehends species, which, while exhibiting the same general\r\nappearance, differ in the varied development of the similar organs.\r\nThe palm-trees, the scitamineae, the malvaceae, the trees with pinnate\r\nleaves, do not all display the same picturesque beauties; and\r\ngenerally the most beautiful species of each type, in plants as in\r\nanimals, belong to the equinoctial zone.\r\n\r\nThe proteaceae,* (* Rhopalas, which characterise the vegetation of the\r\nLlanos.) crotons, agaves, and the great tribe of the cactuses, which\r\ninhabit exclusively the New World, disappear gradually, as we ascend\r\nthe Orinoco above the Apure and the Meta. It is, however, the shade\r\nand humidity, rather than the distance from the coast, which oppose\r\nthe migration of the cactuses southward. We found forests of them\r\nmingled with crotons, covering a great space of arid land to the east\r\nof the Andes, in the province of Bracamoros, towards the Upper\r\nMaranon. The arborescent ferns seem to fail entirely near the\r\ncataracts of the Orinoco; we found no species as far as San Fernando\r\nde Atabapo, that is, to the confluence of the Orinoco and the\r\nGuaviare.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined the vicinity of the Atures, it remains for me to\r\nspeak of the rapids themselves, which occur in a part of the valley\r\nwhere the bed of the river, deeply ingulfed, has almost inaccessible\r\nbanks. It was only in a very few spots that we could enter the Orinoco\r\nto bathe, between the two cataracts, in coves where the waters have\r\neddies of little velocity. Persons who have dwelt in the Alps, the\r\nPyrenees, or even the Cordilleras, so celebrated for the fractures and\r\nthe vestiges of destruction which they display at every step, can\r\nscarcely picture to themselves, from a mere narration, the state of\r\nthe bed of the river. It is traversed, in an extent of more than five\r\nmiles, by innumerable dikes of rock, forming so many natural dams, so\r\nmany barriers resembling those of the Dnieper, which the ancients\r\ndesignated by the name of phragmoi. The space between the rocky dikes\r\nof the Orinoco is filled with islands of different dimensions; some\r\nhilly, divided into several peaks, and two or three hundred toises in\r\nlength, others small, low, and like mere shoals. These islands divide\r\nthe river into a number of torrents, which boil up as they break\r\nagainst the rocks. The jaguas and cucuritos with plumy leaves, with\r\nwhich all the islands are covered, seem like groves of palm-trees\r\nrising from the foamy surface of the waters. The Indians, whose task\r\nit is to pass the boats empty over the raudales, distinguish every\r\nshelf, and every rock, by a particular name. On entering from the\r\nsouth you find first the Leap of the Toucan (Salto del Piapoco); and\r\nbetween the islands of Avaguri and Javariveni is the Raudal of\r\nJavariveni, where, on our return from Rio Negro, we passed some hours\r\namid the rapids, waiting for our boat. A great part of the river\r\nappeared dry. Blocks of granite are heaped together, as in the\r\nmoraines which the glaciers of Switzerland drive before them. The\r\nriver is ingulfed in caverns; and in one of these caverns we heard the\r\nwater roll at once over our heads and beneath our feet. The Orinoco\r\nseems divided into a multitude of arms or torrents, each of which\r\nseeks to force a passage through the rocks. We were struck with the\r\nlittle water to be seen in the bed of the river, the frequency of\r\nsubterraneous falls, and the tumult of the waters breaking on the\r\nrocks in foam.\r\n\r\nCuncta fremunt undis; ac multo murmure montis\r\nSpumeus invictis canescit fluctibus amnis.*\r\n(* Lucan, Pharsalia lib 10 v 132.)\r\n\r\nHaving passed the Raudal of Javariveni (I name here only the principal\r\nfalls) we come to the Raudal of Canucari, formed by a ledge of rocks\r\nuniting the islands of Surupamana and Uirapuri. When the dikes, or\r\nnatural dams, are only two or three feet high, the Indians venture to\r\ndescend them in boats. In going up the river, they swim on before, and\r\nif, after many vain efforts, they succeed in fixing a rope to one of\r\nthe points of rock that crown the dike, they then, by means of that\r\nrope, draw the bark to the top of the raudal. The bark, during this\r\narduous task, often fills with water; at other times it is stove\r\nagainst the rocks, and the Indians, their bodies bruised and bleeding,\r\nextricate themselves with difficulty from the whirlpools, and reach,\r\nby swimming, the nearest island. When the steps or rocky barriers are\r\nvery high, and entirely bar the river, light boats are carried on\r\nshore, and with the help of branches of trees placed under them to\r\nserve as rollers, they are drawn as far as the place where the river\r\nagain becomes navigable. This operation is seldom necessary when the\r\nwater is high. We cannot speak of the cataracts of the Orinoco without\r\nrecalling to mind the manner heretofore employed for descending the\r\ncataracts of the Nile, of which Seneca has left us a description\r\nprobably more poetical than accurate. I shall cite the passage, which\r\ntraces with fidelity what may be seen every day at Atures, Maypures,\r\nand in some pongos of the Amazon. \"Two men embark in a small boat; one\r\nsteers, and the other empties it as it fills with water. Long buffeted\r\nby the rapids, the whirlpools, and the contrary currents, they pass\r\nthrough the narrowest channels, avoid the shoals, and rush down the\r\nwhole river, guiding the course of the boat in its accelerated fall.\"\r\n(Nat. Quaest. lib 4 cap 2 edit. Elzev. tome 2 page 609.)\r\n\r\nIn hydrographic descriptions of countries, the vague names of\r\ncataracts, cascades, falls, and rapids,* (* The corresponding terms in\r\nuse among the people of South America, are saltos, chorros, pongos,\r\ncachoeiras, and raudales.) denoting those tumultuous movements of\r\nwater which arise from very different circumstances, are generally\r\nconfounded with one another. Sometimes a whole river precipitating\r\nitself from a great height, and by one single fall, renders navigation\r\nimpossible. Such is the majestic fall of the Rio Tequendama, which I\r\nhave represented in my Views of the Cordilleras; such are the falls of\r\nNiagara and of the Rhine, much less remarkable for their elevation,\r\nthan for the mass of water they contain. Sometimes stony dikes of\r\nsmall height succeed each other at great distances, and form distinct\r\nfalls; such are the cachoeiras of the Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira,\r\nthe saltos of the Rio Cauca, and the greater part of the pongos that\r\nare found in the Upper Maranon, from the confluence of the Chinchipe\r\nto the village of San Borja. The highest and most formidable of these\r\npongos, which are descended on rafts, that of Mayasi, is however only\r\nthree feet in height. Sometimes small rocky dikes are so near each\r\nother that they form for several miles an uninterrupted succession of\r\ncascades and whirlpools (chorros and remolinos); these are properly\r\nwhat are called rapids (raudales). Such are the yellalas, or rapids of\r\nthe River Zaire,* or Congo, which Captain Tuckey has recently made\r\nknown to us (* Voyage to explore the River Zaire, 1818, pages 152,\r\n327, 340. What the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia call chellal\r\nin the Nile, is called yellala in the River Congo. This analogy\r\nbetween words signifying rapids is remarkable, on account of the\r\nenormous distance of the yellalas of the Congo from the chellal and\r\ndjenadel of the Nile. Did the word chellal penetrate with the Moors\r\ninto the west of Africa? If, with Burckhardt, we consider the origin\r\nof this word as Arabic (Travels in Nubia, 1819), it must be derived\r\nfrom the root challa, to disperse, which forms chelil, water falling\r\nthrough a narrow channel.); the rapids of the Orange River in Africa,\r\nabove Pella; and the falls of the Missouri, which are four leagues in\r\nlength, where the river issues from the Rocky Mountains. Such also are\r\nthe cataracts of Atures and Maypures; the only cataracts which,\r\nsituated in the equinoctial region of the New World, are adorned with\r\nthe noble growth of palm-trees. At all seasons they exhibit the aspect\r\nof cascades, and present the greatest obstacles to the navigation of\r\nthe Orinoco, while the rapids of the Ohio and of Upper Egypt are\r\nscarcely visible at the period of floods. A solitary cataract, like\r\nNiagara, or the cascade of Terni, affords a grand but single picture,\r\nvarying only as the observer changes his place. Rapids, on the\r\ncontrary, especially when adorned with large trees, embellish a\r\nlandscape during a length of several leagues. Sometimes the tumultuous\r\nmovement of the waters is caused only by extraordinary contractions of\r\nthe beds of the rivers. Such is the angostura of Carare, in the river\r\nMagdalena, a strait that impedes communication between Santa Fe de\r\nBogota and the coast of Carthagena; and such is the pongo of\r\nManseriche, in the Upper Maranon.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and almost all the confluents of the\r\nAmazon and the Maranon, have falls or rapids, either because they\r\ncross the mountains where they take rise, or because they meet other\r\nmountains in their course. If the Amazon, from the pongo of Manseriche\r\n(or, to speak with more precision, from the pongo of Tayuchuc) as far\r\nas its mouth, a space of more than seven hundred and fifty leagues,\r\nexhibit no tumultuous movement of the waters, the river owes this\r\nadvantage to the uniform direction of its course. It flows from west\r\nto east in a vast plain, forming a longitudinal valley between the\r\nmountains of Parima and the great mass of the mountains of Brazil.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find by actual measurement that the rapids of the\r\nOrinoco, the roar of which is heard at the distance of more than a\r\nleague, and which are so eminently picturesque from the varied\r\nappearance of the waters, the palm-trees and the rocks, have not\r\nprobably, on their whole length, a height of more than twenty-eight\r\nfeet perpendicular. In reflecting on this, we find that it is a great\r\ndeal for rapids, while it would be very little for a single cataract.\r\nThe Yellalas of the Rio Congo, in the contracted part of the river\r\nfrom Banza Noki as far as Banza Inga, furnish, between the upper and\r\nlower levels, a much more considerable difference; but Mr. Barrow\r\nobserves, that among the great number of these rapids there is one\r\nfall, which alone is thirty feet high. On the other hand, the famous\r\npongos of the river Amazon, so dangerous to go up, the falls of\r\nRentema, of Escurrebragas, and of Mayasi, are but a few feet in\r\nperpendicular height. Those who are engaged in hydraulic works know\r\nthe effect that a bar of eighteen or twenty inches' height produces in\r\na great river. The whirling and tumultuous movement of the water does\r\nnot depend solely on the greatness of partial falls; what determines\r\nthe force and impetuosity is the nearness of these falls, the\r\nsteepness of the rocky ledges, the returning sheets of water which\r\nstrike against and surmount each other, the form of the islands and\r\nshoals, the direction of the counter-currents, and the contraction and\r\nsinuosity of the channels through which the waters force a passage\r\nbetween two adjacent levels. In two rivers equally large, that of\r\nwhich the falls have least height may sometimes present the greatest\r\ndangers and the most impetuous movements.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the river Orinoco loses part of its waters in the\r\ncataracts, not only by increased evaporation, caused by the dispersion\r\nof minute drops in the atmosphere, but still more by filtrations into\r\nthe subterraneous cavities. These losses, however, are not very\r\nperceptible when we compare the mass of waters entering into the\r\nraudal with that which issues out near the mouth of the Rio Anaveni.\r\nIt was by a similar comparison that the existence of subterraneous\r\ncavities in the yellalas or rapids of the river Congo was discovered.\r\nThe pongo of Manseriche, which ought rather to be called a strait than\r\na fall, ingulfs, in a manner not yet sufficiently explored, a part of\r\nthe waters and all the floating wood of the Upper Maranon.\r\n\r\nThe spectator, seated on the bank of the Orinoco, with his eyes fixed\r\non those rocky dikes, is naturally led to inquire whether, in the\r\nlapse of ages, the falls change their form or height. I am not much\r\ninclined to believe in such effects of the shock of water against\r\nblocks of granite, and in the erosion of siliceous matter. The holes\r\nnarrowed toward the bottom, the funnels that are discovered in the\r\nraudales, as well as near so many other cascades in Europe, are owing\r\nonly to the friction of the sand, and the movement of quartz pebbles.\r\nWe saw many such, whirled perpetually by the current at the bottom of\r\nthe funnels, and contributing to enlarge them in every direction. The\r\npongos of the river Amazon are easily destroyed, because the rocky\r\ndikes are not granite, but a conglomerate, or red sandstone with large\r\nfragments. A part of the pongo of Rentama was broken down eighty years\r\nago, and the course of the waters being interrupted by a new bar, the\r\nbed of the river remained dry for some hours, to the great\r\nastonishment of the inhabitants of the village of Payaya, seven\r\nleagues below the pongo. The Indians of Atures assert (and in this\r\ntheir testimony is contrary to the opinion of Caulin) that the rocks\r\nof the raudal preserve the same aspect; but that the partial torrents\r\ninto which the great river divides itself as it passes through the\r\nheaped blocks of granite, change their direction, and carry sometimes\r\nmore, sometimes less water towards one or the other bank; but the\r\ncauses of these changes may be very remote from the cataracts, for in\r\nthe rivers that spread life over the surface of the globe, as in the\r\narteries by which it is diffused through organized bodies, all the\r\nmovements are propagated to great distances. Oscillations, that at\r\nfirst seem partial, react on the whole liquid mass contained in the\r\ntrunk as well as in its numerous ramifications.\r\n\r\nSome of the Missionaries in their writings have alleged that the\r\ninhabitants of Atures and Maypures have been struck with deafness by\r\nthe noise of the Great Cataracts, but this is untrue. When the noise\r\nis heard in the plain that surrounds the mission, at the distance of\r\nmore than a league, you seem to be near a coast skirted by reefs and\r\nbreakers. The noise is three times as loud by night as by day, and\r\ngives an inexpressible charm to these solitary scenes. What can be the\r\ncause of this increased intensity of sound, in a desert where nothing\r\nseems to interrupt the silence of nature? The velocity of the\r\npropagation of sound, far from augmenting, decreases with the lowering\r\nof the temperature. The intensity diminishes in air agitated by a wind\r\nwhich is contrary to the direction of the sound; it diminishes also by\r\ndilatation of the air, and is weaker in the higher than in the lower\r\nregions of the atmosphere, where the number of particles of air in\r\nmotion is greater in the same radius. The intensity is the same in dry\r\nair, and in air mingled with vapours; but it is feebler in carbonic\r\nacid gas than in mixtures of azote and oxygen. From these facts, which\r\nare all we know with any certainty, it is difficult to explain a\r\nphenomenon observed near every cascade in Europe, and which, long\r\nbefore our arrival in the village of Atures, had struck the missionary\r\nand the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that, even in places not inhabited by man, the hum\r\nof insects, the song of birds, the rustling of leaves agitated by the\r\nfeeblest winds, occasion during the day a confused noise, which we\r\nperceive the less because it is uniform, and constantly strikes the\r\near. Now this noise, however slightly perceptible it may be, may\r\ndiminish the intensity of a louder noise; and this diminution may\r\ncease if during the calm of the night the song of birds, the hum of\r\ninsects, and the action of the wind upon the leaves be interrupted.\r\nBut this reasoning, even admitting its justness, can scarcely be\r\napplied to the forests of the Orinoco, where the air is constantly\r\nfilled by an innumerable quantity of mosquitos, where the hum of\r\ninsects is much louder by night than by day, and where the breeze, if\r\never it be felt, blows only after sunset.\r\n\r\nI rather think that the presence of the sun acts upon the propagation\r\nand intensity of sound by the obstacles met in currents of air of\r\ndifferent density, and by the partial undulations of the atmosphere\r\narising from the unequal heating of different parts of the soil. In\r\ncalm air, whether dry or mingled with vesicular vapours equally\r\ndistributed, sound-waves are propagated without difficulty. But when\r\nthe air is crossed in every direction by small currents of hotter air,\r\nthe sonorous undulation is divided into two undulations where the\r\ndensity of the medium changes abruptly; partial echoes are formed that\r\nweaken the sound, because one of the streams comes back upon itself;\r\nand those divisions of undulations take place of which M. Poisson has\r\ndeveloped the theory with great sagacity.* (* Annales de Chimie tome 7\r\npage 293.) It is not therefore the movement of the particles of air\r\nfrom below to above in the ascending current, or the small oblique\r\ncurrents that we consider as opposing by a shock the propagation of\r\nthe sonorous undulations. A shock given to the surface of a liquid\r\nwill form circles around the centre of percussion, even when the\r\nliquid is agitated. Several kinds of undulations may cross each other\r\nin water, as in air, without being disturbed in their propagation:\r\nlittle movements may, as it were, ride over each other, and the real\r\ncause of the less intensity of sound during the day appears to be the\r\ninterpretation of homogeneity in the elastic medium. During the day\r\nthere is a sudden interruption of density wherever small streamlets of\r\nair of a high temperature rise over parts of the soil unequally\r\nheated. The sonorous undulations are divided, as the rays of light are\r\nrefracted and form the mirage wherever strata of air of unequal\r\ndensity are contiguous. The propagation of sound is altered when a\r\nstratum of hydrogen gas is made to rise in a tube closed at one end\r\nabove a stratum of atmospheric air; and M. Biot has well explained, by\r\nthe interposition of bubbles of carbonic acid gas, why a glass filled\r\nwith champagne is not sonorous so long as that gas is evolved, and\r\npassing through the strata of the liquid.\r\n\r\nIn support of these ideas, I might almost rest on the authority of an\r\nancient philosopher, whom the moderns do not esteem in proportion to\r\nhis merits, though the most distinguished zoologists have long\r\nrendered ample justice to the sagacity of his observations. \"Why,\"\r\nsays Aristotle in his curious book of Problems, \"why is sound better\r\nheard during the night? Because there is more calmness on account of\r\nthe absence of caloric (of the hottest).* (* I have placed in a\r\nparenthesis, a literal version of the term employed by Aristotle, to\r\nexpress in reality what we now term the matter of heat. Theodore of\r\nGaza, in his Latin translation, expresses in the shape of a doubt what\r\nAristotle positively asserts. I may here remark, that, notwithstanding\r\nthe imperfect state of science among the ancients, the works of the\r\nStagirite contain more ingenious observations than those of many later\r\nphilosophers. It is in vain we look in Aristoxenes (De Musica), in\r\nTheophylactus Simocatta (De Quaestionibus physicis), or in the 5th\r\nBook of the Quest. Nat. of Seneca, for an explanation of the nocturnal\r\naugmentation of sound.) This absence renders every thing calmer, for\r\nthe sun is the principle of all movement.\" Aristotle had no doubt a\r\nvague presentiment of the cause of the phenomenon; but he attributes\r\nto the motion of the atmosphere, and the shock of the particles of\r\nair, that which seems to be rather owing to abrupt changes of density\r\nin the contiguous strata of air.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, towards evening, we received tidings that in\r\nless than six hours our boat had passed the rapids, and had arrived in\r\ngood condition in a cove called el Puerto de arriba, or the Port of\r\nthe Expedition. We were shown in the little church of Atures some\r\nremains of the ancient wealth of the Jesuits. A silver lamp of\r\nconsiderable weight lay on the ground half-buried in the sand. Such an\r\nobject, it is true, would nowhere tempt the cupidity of a savage; yet\r\nI may here remark, to the honor of the natives of the Orinoco, that\r\nthey are not addicted to stealing, like the less savage tribes of the\r\nislands in the Pacific. The former have a great respect for property;\r\nthey do not even attempt to steal provision, hooks, or hatchets. At\r\nMaypures and Atures, locks on doors are unknown: they will be\r\nintroduced only when whites and men of mixed race establish themselves\r\nin the missions.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Atures are mild and moderate, and accustomed, from the\r\neffects of their idleness, to the greatest privations. Formerly, being\r\nexcited to labour by the Jesuits, they did not want for food. The\r\nfathers cultivated maize, French beans (frijoles), and other European\r\nvegetables; they even planted sweet oranges and tamarinds round the\r\nvillages; and they possessed twenty or thirty thousand head of cows\r\nand horses, in the savannahs of Atures and Carichana. They had at\r\ntheir service a great number of slaves and servants (peones), to tend\r\ntheir herds. Nothing is now cultivated but a little cassava, and a few\r\nplantains. Such however is the fertility of the soil, that at Atures I\r\ncounted on a single branch of a musa one hundred and eight fruits,\r\nfour or five of which would almost have sufficed for a man's daily\r\nfood. The culture of maize is entirely neglected, and the horses and\r\ncows have entirely disappeared. Near the raudal, a part of the village\r\nstill bears the name of Passo del ganado (ford of the cattle), while\r\nthe descendants of those very Indians whom the Jesuits had assembled\r\nin a mission, speak of horned cattle as of animals of a race now lost.\r\nIn going up the Orinoco, toward San Carlos del Rio Negro, we saw the\r\nlast cow at Carichana. The Fathers of the Observance, who now govern\r\nthese vast countries, did not immediately succeed the Jesuits. During\r\nan interregnum of eighteen years, the missions were visited only from\r\ntime to time, and by Capuchin monks. The agents of the secular\r\ngovernment, under the title of Royal Commissioners, managed the hatos\r\nor farms of the Jesuits with culpable negligence. They killed the\r\ncattle for the sake of selling the hides. Many heifers were devoured\r\nby the jaguars, and a great number perished in consequence of wounds\r\nmade by the bats of the raudales, which, though smaller, are far\r\nbolder than the bats of the Llanos. At the time of the expedition of\r\nthe boundaries, horses from Encaramada, Carichana, and Atures, were\r\nconveyed as far as San Jose de Maravitanos, where, on the banks of the\r\nRio Negro, the Portuguese could only procure them, after a long\r\npassage, and of a very inferior quality, by the rivers Amazon and\r\nGrand Para. Since the year 1795, the cattle of the Jesuits have\r\nentirely disappeared. There now remain as monuments of the ancient\r\ncultivation of these countries, and the active industry of the first\r\nmissionaries, only a few trunks of the orange and tamarind, in the\r\nsavannahs, surrounded by wild trees.\r\n\r\nThe tigers, or jaguars, which are less dangerous for the cattle than\r\nthe bats, come into the village at Atures, and devour the swine of the\r\npoor Indians. The missionary related to us a striking instance of the\r\nfamiliarity of these animals, usually so ferocious. Some months before\r\nour arrival, a jaguar, which was thought to be young, though of a\r\nlarge size, had wounded a child in playing with him. The facts of this\r\ncase, which were verified to us on the spot, are not without interest\r\nin the history of the manners of animals. Two Indian children, a boy\r\nand a girl, about eight and nine years of age, were seated on the\r\ngrass near the village of Atures, in the middle of a savannah, which\r\nwe several times traversed. At two o'clock in the afternoon, a jaguar\r\nissued from the forest, and approached the children, bounding around\r\nthem; sometimes he hid himself in the high grass, sometimes he sprang\r\nforward, his back bent, his head hung down, in the manner of our cats.\r\nThe little boy, ignorant of his danger, seemed to be sensible of it\r\nonly when the jaguar with one of his paws gave him some blows on the\r\nhead. These blows, at first slight, became ruder and ruder; the claws\r\nof the jaguar wounded the child, and the blood flowed freely. The\r\nlittle girl then took a branch of a tree, struck the animal, and it\r\nfled from her. The Indians ran up at the cries of the children, and\r\nsaw the jaguar, which then bounded off without making the least show\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nThe little boy was brought to us, who appeared lively and intelligent.\r\nThe claw of the jaguar had torn away the skin from the lower part of\r\nthe forehead, and there was a second scar at the top of the head. This\r\nwas a singular fit of playfulness in an animal which, though not\r\ndifficult to be tamed in our menageries, nevertheless shows itself\r\nalways wild and ferocious in its natural state. If we admit that,\r\nbeing sure of its prey, it played with the little Indian as our cats\r\nplay with birds whose wings have been clipped, how shall we explain\r\nthe patience of a jaguar of large size, which finds itself attacked by\r\na girl? If the jaguar were not pressed by hunger, why did it approach\r\nthe children at all? There is something mysterious in the affections\r\nand hatreds of animals. We have known lions kill three or four dogs\r\nthat were put into their den, and instantly caress a fifth, which,\r\nless timid, took the king of animals by the mane. These are instincts\r\nof which we know not the secret.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that domestic pigs are attacked by the jaguars.\r\nThere are in these countries, besides the common swine of European\r\nrace, several species of peccaries, or pigs with lumbar glands, two of\r\nwhich only are known to the naturalists of Europe. The Indians call\r\nthe little peccary (Dicotiles torquatus, Cuv.), in the Maypure tongue,\r\nchacharo; while they give the name of apida to a species of pig which\r\nthey say has no pouch, is larger, and of a dark brown colour, with the\r\nbelly and lower jaw white. The chacharo, reared in the houses, becomes\r\ntame like our sheep and goats. It reminds us, by the gentleness of its\r\nmanners, of the curious analogies which anatomists have observed\r\nbetween the peccaries and the ruminating animals. The apida, which is\r\ndomesticated like our swine in Europe, wanders in large herds composed\r\nof several hundreds. The presence of these herds is announced from\r\nafar, not only by their hoarse gruntings, but above all by the\r\nimpetuosity with which they break down the shrubs in their way. M.\r\nBonpland, in an herborizing excursion, warned by his Indian guide to\r\nhide himself behind the trunk of a tree, saw a number of these\r\npeccaries (cochinos or puercos del monte) pass close by him. The herd\r\nmarched in a close body, the males proceeding first; and each sow was\r\naccompanied by her young. The flesh of the chacharo is flabby, and not\r\nvery agreeable; it affords, however, a plentiful nourishment to the\r\nnatives, who kill these animals with small lances tied to cords. We\r\nwere assured at Atures, that the tiger dreads being surrounded in the\r\nforests by these herds of wild pigs; and that, to avoid being stifled,\r\nhe tries to save himself by climbing up a tree. Is this a hunter's\r\ntale, or a fact that has really been observed? In several parts of\r\nAmerica the hunters believe in the existence of a javali, or native\r\nboar with tusks curved outwardly. I never saw one, but this animal is\r\nmentioned in the works of the Spanish missionaries, a source too much\r\nneglected by zoologists; for amidst much incorrectness and\r\nextravagance, they contain many curious local observations.\r\n\r\nAmong the monkeys which we saw at the mission of the Atures, we found\r\none new species, of the tribe of sais and sajous, which the Creoles\r\nvulgarly call machis. It is the Guvapavi with grey hair and a bluish\r\nface. It has the orbits of the eyes and the forehead as white as snow,\r\na peculiarity which at first sight distinguishes it from the Simia\r\ncapucina, the Simia apella, the Simia trepida, and the other weeping\r\nmonkeys hitherto so confusedly described. This little animal is as\r\ngentle as it is ugly. A monkey of this species, which was kept in the\r\ncourtyard of the missionary, would frequently mount on the back of a\r\npig, and in this manner traverse the savannahs. We have also seen it\r\nupon the back of a large cat, which had been brought up with it in\r\nFather Zea's house.\r\n\r\nIt was among the cataracts that we began to hear of the hairy man of\r\nthe woods, called salvaje, that carries off women, constructs huts,\r\nand sometimes eats human flesh. The Tamanacs call it achi, and the\r\nMaypures vasitri, or great devil. The natives and the missionaries\r\nhave no doubt of the existence of this man-shaped monkey, of which\r\nthey entertain a singular dread. Father Gili gravely relates the\r\nhistory of a lady in the town of San Carlos, in the Llanos of\r\nVenezuela, who much praised the gentle character and attentions of the\r\nman of the woods. She is stated to have lived several years with one\r\nin great domestic harmony, and only requested some hunters to take her\r\nback, because she and her children (a little hairy also) were weary of\r\nliving far from the church and the sacraments. The same author,\r\nnotwithstanding his credulity, acknowledges that he never knew an\r\nIndian who asserted positively that he had seen the salvaje with his\r\nown eyes. This wild legend, which the missionaries, the European\r\nplanters, and the negroes of Africa, have no doubt embellished with\r\nmany features taken from the description of the manners of the\r\norang-otang,* the gibbon, the jocko or chimpanzee, and the pongo,\r\nfollowed us, during five years, from the northern to the southern\r\nhemisphere. (* Simia satyrus. We must not believe, notwithstanding the\r\nassertions of almost all zoological writers, that the word orang-otang\r\nis applied exclusively in the Malay language to the Simia satyrus of\r\nBorneo. This expression, on the contrary, means any very large monkey,\r\nthat resembles man in figure. Marsden's History of Sumatra 3rd edition\r\npage 117. Modern zoologists have arbitrarily appropriated provincial\r\nnames to certain species; and by continuing to prefer these names,\r\nstrangely disfigured in their orthography, to the Latin systematic\r\nnames, the confusion of the nomenclature has been increased.) We were\r\neverywhere blamed, in the most cultivated class of society, for being\r\nthe only persons to doubt the existence of the great anthropomorphous\r\nmonkey of America. There are certain regions where this belief is\r\nparticularly prevalent among the people; such are the banks of the\r\nUpper Orinoco, the valley of Upar near the lake of Maracaybo, the\r\nmountains of Santa Martha and of Merida, the provinces of Quixos, and\r\nthe banks of the Amazon near Tomependa. In all these places, so\r\ndistant one from the other, it is asserted that the salvaje is easily\r\nrecognized by the traces of its feet, the toes of which are turned\r\nbackward. But if there exist a monkey of a large size in the New\r\nContinent, how has it happened that for three centuries no man worthy\r\nof belief has been able to procure the skin of one? Several hypotheses\r\npresent themselves to the mind, in order to explain the source of so\r\nancient an error or belief. Has the famous capuchin monkey of\r\nEsmeralda (Simia chiropotes), with its long canine teeth, and\r\nphysiognomy much more like man's* (* The whole of the features--the\r\nexpression of the physiognomy; but not the forehead.) than that of the\r\norang-otang, given rise to the fable of the salvaje? It is not so\r\nlarge indeed as the coaita (Simia paniscus); but when seen at the top\r\nof a tree, and the head only visible, it might easily be taken for a\r\nhuman being. It may be also (and this opinion appears to me the most\r\nprobable) that the man of the woods was one of those large bears, the\r\nfootsteps of which resemble those of a man, and which are believed in\r\nevery country to attack women. The animal killed in my time at the\r\nfoot of the mountains of Merida, and sent, by the name of salvaje, to\r\nColonel Ungaro, the governor of the province of Varinas, was in fact a\r\nbear with black and smooth fur. Our fellow-traveller, Don Nicolas\r\nSoto, had examined it closely. Did the strange idea of a plantigrade\r\nanimal, the toes of which are placed as if it walked backward, take\r\nits origin from the habit of the real savages of the woods, the\r\nIndians of the weakest and most timid tribes, of deceiving their\r\nenemies, when they enter a forest, or cross a sandy shore, by covering\r\nthe traces of their feet with sand, or walking backward?\r\n\r\nThough I have expressed my doubts of the existence of an unknown\r\nspecies of large monkey in a continent which appears entirely\r\ndestitute of quadrumanous animals of the family of the orangs,\r\ncynocephali, mandrils, and pongos; yet it should be remembered that\r\nalmost all matters of popular belief, even those most absurd in\r\nappearance, rest on real facts, but facts ill observed. In treating\r\nthem with disdain, the traces of a discovery may often be lost, in\r\nnatural philosophy as well as in zoology. We will not then admit, with\r\na Spanish author, that the fable of the man of the woods was invented\r\nby the artifice of Indian women, who pretended to have been carried\r\noff, when they had been long absent unknown to their husbands.\r\nTravellers who may hereafter visit the missions of the Orinoco will do\r\nwell to follow up our researches on the salvaje or great devil of the\r\nwoods; and examine whether it be some unknown species of bear, or some\r\nvery rare monkey analogous to the Simia chiropotes, or Simia satanas,\r\nwhich may have given rise to such singular tales.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent two days near the cataract of Atures, we were not\r\nsorry when our boat was reladen, and we were enabled to leave a spot\r\nwhere the temperature of the air is generally by day twenty-nine\r\ndegrees, and by night twenty-six degrees, of the centigrade\r\nthermometer. This temperature seemed to us to be still much more\r\nelevated, from the feeling of heat which we experienced. The want of\r\nconcordance between the instruments and the sensations must be\r\nattributed to the continual irritation of the skin excited by the\r\nmosquitos. An atmosphere filled with venomous insects always appears\r\nto be more heated than it is in reality. We were horribly tormented in\r\nthe day by mosquitos and the jejen, a small venomous fly (simulium),\r\nand at night by the zancudos, a large species of gnat, dreaded even by\r\nthe natives. Our hands began to swell considerably, and this swelling\r\nincreased daily till our arrival on the banks of the Temi. The means\r\nthat are employed to escape from these little plagues are very\r\nextraordinary. The good missionary Bernardo Zea, who passed his life\r\ntormented by mosquitos, had constructed near the church, on a\r\nscaffolding of trunks of palm-trees, a small apartment, in which we\r\nbreathed more freely. To this we went up in the evening, by means of a\r\nladder, to dry our plants and write our journal. The missionary had\r\njustly observed, that the insects abounded more particularly in the\r\nlowest strata of the atmosphere, that which reaches from the ground to\r\nthe height of twelve or fifteen feet. At Maypures the Indians quit the\r\nvillage at night, to go and sleep on the little islets in the midst of\r\nthe cataracts. There they enjoy some rest; the mosquitoes appearing to\r\nshun air loaded with vapours. We found everywhere fewer in the middle\r\nof the river than near its banks; and thus less is suffered in\r\ndescending the Orinoco than in going up in a boat.\r\n\r\nPersons who have not navigated the great rivers of equinoctial\r\nAmerica, for instance, the Orinoco and the Magdalena, can scarcely\r\nconceive how, at every instant, without intermission, you may be\r\ntormented by insects flying in the air; and how the multitude of these\r\nlittle animals may render vast regions almost uninhabitable. Whatever\r\nfortitude be exercised to endure pain without complaint, whatever\r\ninterest may be felt in the objects of scientific research, it is\r\nimpossible not to be constantly disturbed by the mosquitos, zancudos,\r\njejens, and tempraneros, that cover the face and hands, pierce the\r\nclothes with their long needle-formed suckers, and getting into the\r\nmouth and nostrils, occasion coughing and sneezing whenever any\r\nattempt is made to speak in the open air. In the missions of the\r\nOrinoco, in the villages on the banks of the river, surrounded by\r\nimmense forests, the plaga de las moscas, or the plague of the\r\nmosquitos, affords an inexhaustible subject of conversation. When two\r\npersons meet in the morning, the first questions they address to each\r\nother are: How did you find the zancudos during the night? How are we\r\nto-day for the mosquitos?* (* Que le han parecido los zancudos de\r\nnoche? Como stamos hoy de mosquitos?) These questions remind us of a\r\nChinese form of politeness, which indicates the ancient state of the\r\ncountry where it took birth. Salutations were made heretofore in the\r\nCelestial empire in the following words, vou-to-hou, Have you been\r\nincommoded in the night by the serpents?\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the insects of the family of tipulae\r\npresents very remarkable phenomena. It does not appear to depend\r\nsolely on heat of climate, excess of humidity, or the thickness of\r\nforests, but on local circumstances that are difficult to\r\ncharacterise. It may be observed that the plague of mosquitos and\r\nzancudos is not so general in the torrid zone as is commonly believed.\r\nOn the table-lands elevated more than four hundred toises above the\r\nlevel of the ocean, in the very dry plains remote from the beds of\r\ngreat rivers (for instance, at Cumana and Calabozo), there are not\r\nsensibly more gnats than in the most populous parts of Europe. They\r\nare perceived to augment enormously at Nueva Barcelona, and more to\r\nthe west, on the coast that extends towards Cape Codera. Between the\r\nlittle harbour of Higuerote and the mouth of the Rio Unare, the\r\nwretched inhabitants are accustomed to stretch themselves on the\r\nground, and pass the night buried in the sand three or four inches\r\ndeep, leaving out the head only, which they cover with a handkerchief.\r\nYou suffer from the sting of insects, but in a manner easy to bear, in\r\ndescending the Orinoco from Cabruta towards Angostura, and in going up\r\nfrom Cabruta towards Uruana, between the latitudes of 7 and 8 degrees.\r\nBut beyond the mouth of the Rio Arauca, after having passed the strait\r\nof Baraguan, the scene suddenly changes. From this spot the traveller\r\nmay bid farewell to repose. If he have any poetical remembrance of\r\nDante, he may easily imagine he has entered the citta dolente, and he\r\nwill seem to read on the granite rocks of Baraguan these lines of the\r\nInferno:\r\n\r\nNoi sem venuti al luogo, ov' i' t'ho detto\r\nChe tu vedrai le genti dolorose.\r\n\r\nThe lower strata of air, from the surface of the ground to the height\r\nof fifteen or twenty feet, are absolutely filled with venomous\r\ninsects. If in an obscure spot, for instance in the grottos of the\r\ncataracts formed by superincumbent blocks of granite, you direct your\r\neyes toward the opening enlightened by the sun, you see clouds of\r\nmosquitos more or less thick. At the mission of San Borja, the\r\nsuffering from mosquitos is greater than at Carichana; but in the\r\nRaudales, at Atures, and above all at Maypures, this suffering may be\r\nsaid to attain its maximum. I doubt whether there be a country upon\r\nearth where man is exposed to more cruel torments in the rainy season.\r\nHaving passed the fifth degree of latitude, you are somewhat less\r\nstung; but on the Upper Orinoco the stings are more painful, because\r\nthe heat and the absolute want of wind render the air more burning and\r\nmore irritating in its contact with the skin.\r\n\r\n\"How comfortable must people be in the moon!\" said a Salive Indian to\r\nFather Gumilla; \"she looks so beautiful and so clear, that she must be\r\nfree from mosquitos.\" These words, which denote the infancy of a\r\npeople, are very remarkable. The satellite of the earth appears to all\r\nsavage nations the abode of the blessed, the country of abundance. The\r\nEsquimaux, who counts among his riches a plank or trunk of a tree,\r\nthrown by the currents on a coast destitute of vegetation, sees in the\r\nmoon plains covered with forests; the Indian of the forests of Orinoco\r\nthere beholds open savannahs, where the inhabitants are never stung by\r\nmosquitos.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding further to the south, where the system of\r\nyellowish-brown waters commences,* (* Generally called black waters,\r\naguas negras.) on the banks of the Atabapo, the Tuni, the Tuamini, and\r\nthe Rio Negro, we enjoyed an unexpected repose. These rivers, like the\r\nOrinoco, cross thick forests, but the tipulary insects, as well as the\r\ncrocodiles, shun the proximity of the black waters. Possibly these\r\nwaters, which are a little colder, and chemically different from the\r\nwhite waters, are adverse to the larvae of tipulary insects and gnats,\r\nwhich may be considered as real aquatic animals. Some small rivers,\r\nthe colour of which is deep blue, or yellowish-brown (as the Toparo,\r\nthe Mataveni, and the Zama), are exceptions to the almost general rule\r\nof the absence of mosquitos over the black waters. These three rivers\r\nswarm with them; and the Indians themselves fixed our attention on the\r\nproblematic causes of this phenomenon. In going down the Rio Negro, we\r\nbreathed freely at Maroa, Daripe, and San Carlos, villages situated on\r\nthe boundaries of Brazil. But this improvement of our situation was of\r\nshort continuance; our sufferings recommenced as soon as we entered\r\nthe Cassiquiare. At Esmeralda, at the eastern extremity of the Upper\r\nOrinoco, where ends the known world of the Spaniards, the clouds of\r\nmosquitos are almost as thick as at the Great Cataracts. At Mandavaca\r\nwe found an old missionary, who told us with an air of sadness, that\r\nhe had had his twenty years of mosquitos in America*. (* \"Yo tengo mis\r\nveinte anos de mosquitos.\") He desired us to look at his legs, that we\r\nmight be able to tell one day, beyond sea (por alla), what the poor\r\nmonks suffer in the forests of Cassiquiare. Every sting leaving a\r\nsmall darkish brown point, his legs were so speckled that it was\r\ndifficult to recognize the whiteness of his skin through the spots of\r\ncoagulated blood. If the insects of the genus Simulium abound in the\r\nCassiquiare, which has white waters, the culices or zancudos are so\r\nmuch the more rare; you scarcely find any there; while on the rivers\r\nof black waters, in the Atabapo and the Rio, there are generally some\r\nzancudos and no mosquitos.\r\n\r\nI have just shown, from my own observations, how much the geographical\r\ndistribution of venomous insects varies in this labyrinth of rivers\r\nwith white and black waters. It were to be wished that a learned\r\nentomologist could study on the spot the specific differences of these\r\nnoxious insects,* which in the torrid zone, in spite of their minute\r\nsize, act an important point in the economy of nature. (* The mosquito\r\nbovo or tenbiguai; the melero, which always settles upon the eyes; the\r\ntempranero, or putchiki; the jejen; the gnat rivau, the great zancudo,\r\nor matchaki; the cafafi, etc.) What appeared to us very remarkable,\r\nand is a fact known to all the missionaries, is, that the different\r\nspecies do not associate together, and that at different hours of the\r\nday you are stung by distinct species. Every time that the scene\r\nchanges, and, to use the simple expression of the missionaries, other\r\ninsects mount guard, you have a few minutes, often a quarter of an\r\nhour, of repose. The insects that disappear have not their places\r\ninstantly supplied by their successors. From half-past-six in the\r\nmorning till five in the afternoon, the air is filled with mosquitos;\r\nwhich have not, as some travellers have stated, the form of our\r\ngnats,* (* Culex pipiens. This difference between mosquito (little\r\nfly, simulium) and zancudo (gnat, culex) exists in all the Spanish\r\ncolonies. The word zancudo signifies long legs, qui tiene las zancas\r\nlargas. The mosquitos of the Orinoco are the moustiques; the zancudos\r\nare the maringouins of French travellers.) but that of a small fly.\r\nThey are simuliums of the family Nemocera of the system of Latreille.\r\nTheir sting is as painful as that of the genus Stomox. It leaves a\r\nlittle reddish brown spot, which is extravased and coagulated blood,\r\nwhere their proboscis has pierced the skin. An hour before sunset a\r\nspecies of small gnats, called tempraneros,* because they appear also\r\nat sunrise, take the place of the mosquitos. (* Which appear at an\r\nearly hour (temprano). Some persons say, that the zancudo is the same\r\nas the tempranero, which returns at night, after hiding itself for\r\nsome time. I have doubts of this identity of the species; the pain\r\ncaused by the sting of the two insects appeared to me different.)\r\nTheir presence scarcely lasts an hour and a half; they disappear\r\nbetween six and seven in the evening, or, as they say here, after the\r\nAngelus (a la oracion). After a few minutes' repose, you feel yourself\r\nstung by zancudos, another species of gnat with very long legs. The\r\nzancudo, the proboscis of which contains a sharp-pointed sucker,\r\ncauses the most acute pain, and a swelling that remains several weeks.\r\nIts hum resembles that of the European gnat, but is louder and more\r\nprolonged. The Indians pretend to distinguish the zancudos and the\r\ntempraneros by their song; the latter are real twilight insects, while\r\nthe zancudos are most frequently nocturnal insects, and disappear\r\ntoward sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn our way from Carthagena to Santa Fe de Bogota, we observed that\r\nbetween Mompox and Honda, in the valley of the Rio Magdalena, the\r\nzancudos darkened the air from eight in the evening till midnight;\r\nthat towards midnight they diminished in number, and were hidden for\r\nthree or four hours; and lastly that they returned in crowds, about\r\nfour in the morning. What is the cause of these alternations of motion\r\nand rest? Are these animals fatigued by long flight? It is rare on the\r\nOrinoco to see real gnats by day; while at the Rio Magdalena we were\r\nstung night and day, except from noon till about two o'clock. The\r\nzancudos of the two rivers are no doubt of different species.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the insects of the tropics everywhere follow a\r\ncertain standard in the periods at which they alternately arrive and\r\ndisappear. At fixed and invariable hours, in the same season, and the\r\nsame latitude, the air is peopled with new inhabitants, and in a zone\r\nwhere the barometer becomes a clock,* (* By the extreme regularity of\r\nthe horary variations of the atmospheric pressure.) where everything\r\nproceeds with such admirable regularity, we might guess blindfold the\r\nhour of the day or night, by the hum of the insects, and by their\r\nstings, the pain of which differs according to the nature of the\r\npoison that each species deposits in the wound.\r\n\r\nAt a period when the geography of animals and of plants had not yet\r\nbeen studied, the analogous species of different climates were often\r\nconfounded. It was believed that the pines and ranunculuses, the\r\nstags, the rats, and the tipulary insects of the north of Europe, were\r\nto be found in Japan, on the ridge of the Andes, and at the Straits of\r\nMagellan. Justly celebrated naturalists have thought that the zancudo\r\nof the torrid zone was the gnat of our marshes, become more vigorous,\r\nmore voracious, and more noxious, under the influence of a burning\r\nclimate. This is a very erroneous opinion. I carefully examined and\r\ndescribed upon the spot those zancudos, the stings of which are most\r\ntormenting. In the rivers Magdalena and Guayaquil alone there are five\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\nThe culices of South America have generally the wings, corslet, and\r\nlegs of an azure colour, ringed and variegated with a mixture of spots\r\nof metallic lustre. Here as in Europe, the males, which are\r\ndistinguished by their feathered antennae, are extremely rare; you are\r\nseldom stung except by females. The preponderance of this sex explains\r\nthe immense increase of the species, each female laying several\r\nhundred eggs. In going up one of the great rivers of America, it is\r\nobserved, that the appearance of a new species of culex denotes the\r\nproximity of a new stream flowing in. I shall mention an instance of\r\nthis curious phenomenon. The Culex lineatus, which belongs to the Cano\r\nTamalamec, is only perceived in the valley of the Rio Grande de la\r\nMagdalena, at a league north of the junction of the two rivers; it\r\ngoes up, but scarcely ever descends the Rio Grande. It is thus, that,\r\non a principal vein, the appearance of a new substance in the gangue\r\nindicates to the miner the neighbourhood of a secondary vein that\r\njoins the first.\r\n\r\nOn recapitulating the observations here recorded, we see, that within\r\nthe tropics, the mosquitos and zancudos do not rise on the slope of\r\nthe Cordilleras* toward the temperate region, where the mean heat is\r\nbelow 19 or 20 degrees (* The culex pipiens of Europe does not, like\r\nthe culex of the torrid zone, shun mountainous places. Giesecke\r\nsuffered from these insects in Greenland, at Disco, in latitude 70\r\ndegrees. They are found in Lapland in summer, at three or four hundred\r\ntoises high, and at a temperature of 11 or 12 degrees.); and that,\r\nwith few exceptions, they shun the black waters, and dry and unwooded\r\nspots.* (* Trifling modifications in the waters, or in the air, often\r\nappear to prevent the development of the mosquitos. Mr. Bowdich\r\nremarks that there are none at Coomassie, in the kingdom of the\r\nAshantees, though the town is surrounded by marshes, and though the\r\nthermometer keeps up between seventeen and twenty-eight centesimal\r\ndegrees, day and night.) The atmosphere swarms with them much more in\r\nthe Upper than in the Lower Orinoco, because in the former the river\r\nis surrounded with thick forests on its banks, and the skirts of the\r\nforests are not separated from the river by a barren and extensive\r\nbeach. The mosquitos diminish on the New Continent with the diminution\r\nof the water, and the destruction of the woods; but the effects of\r\nthese changes are as slow as the progress of cultivation. The towns of\r\nAngostura, Nueva Barcelona, and Mompox, where from the want of police,\r\nthe streets, the great squares, and the interior of court-yards are\r\novergrown with brushwood, are sadly celebrated for the abundance of\r\nzancudos.\r\n\r\nPeople born in the country, whether whites, mulattoes, negroes, or\r\nIndians, all suffer from the sting of these insects. But as cold does\r\nnot render the north of Europe uninhabitable, so the mosquitos do not\r\nprevent men from dwelling in the countries where they abound, provided\r\nthat, by their situation and government, they afford resources for\r\nagriculture and industry. The inhabitants pass their lives in\r\ncomplaining of the insufferable torment of the mosquitos, yet,\r\nnotwithstanding these continual complaints, they seek, and even with a\r\nsort of predilection, the commercial towns of Mompox, Santa Marta, and\r\nRio de la Hacha. Such is the force of habit in evils which we suffer\r\nevery hour of the day, that the three missions of San Borja, Atures,\r\nand Esmeralda, where, to make use of an hyperbolical expression of the\r\nmonks, there are more mosquitos than air,* (* Mas moscas que aire.)\r\nwould no doubt become flourishing towns, if the Orinoco afforded\r\nplanters the same advantages for the exchange of produce, as the Ohio\r\nand the Lower Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that the whites born in the torrid zone may walk\r\nbarefoot with impunity, in the same apartment where a European\r\nrecently landed is exposed to the attack of the nigua or chegoe (Pulex\r\npenetrans). This animal, almost invisible to the eye, gets under the\r\ntoe-nails, and there acquires the size of a small pea, by the quick\r\nincrease of its eggs, which are placed in a bag under the belly of the\r\ninsect. The nigua therefore distinguishes what the most delicate\r\nchemical analysis could not distinguish, the cellular membrane and\r\nblood of a European from those of a creole white. The mosquitos, on\r\nthe contrary, attack equally the natives and the Europeans; but the\r\neffects of the sting are different in the two races of men. The same\r\nvenomous liquid, deposited in the skin of a copper-coloured man of\r\nIndian race, and in that of a white man newly landed, causes no\r\nswelling in the former, while in the latter it produces hard blisters,\r\ngreatly inflamed, and painful for several days; so different is the\r\naction on the epidermis, according to the degree of irritability of\r\nthe organs in different races and different individuals!\r\n\r\nI shall here recite several facts, which prove that the Indians, and\r\nin general all the people of colour, at the moment of being stung,\r\nsuffer like the whites, although perhaps with less intensity of pain.\r\nIn the day-time, and even when labouring at the oar, the natives, in\r\norder to chase the insects, are continually giving one another smart\r\nslaps with the palm of the hand. They even strike themselves and their\r\ncomrades mechanically during their sleep. The violence of their blows\r\nreminds one of the Persian tale of the bear that tried to kill with\r\nhis paw the insects on the forehead of his sleeping master. Near\r\nMaypures we saw some young Indians seated in a circle and rubbing\r\ncruelly each others' backs with the bark of trees dried at the fire.\r\nIndian women were occupied, with a degree of patience of which the\r\ncopper-coloured race alone are capable, in extracting, by means of a\r\nsharp bone, the little mass of coagulated blood that forms the centre\r\nof every sting, and gives the skin a speckled appearance. One of the\r\nmost barbarous nations of the Orinoco, that of the Ottomacs, is\r\nacquainted with the use of mosquito-curtains (mosquiteros) woven from\r\nthe fibres of the moriche palm-tree. At Higuerote, on the coast of\r\nCaracas, the copper-coloured people sleep buried in the sand. In the\r\nvillages of the Rio Magdalena the Indians often invited us to stretch\r\nourselves as they did on ox-skins, near the church, in the middle of\r\nthe plaza grande, where they had assembled all the cows in the\r\nneighbourhood. The proximity of cattle gives some repose to man. The\r\nIndians of the Upper Orinoco and the Cassiquiare, seeing that M.\r\nBonpland could not prepare his herbal, owing to the continual torment\r\nof the mosquitos, invited him to enter their ovens (hornitos). Thus\r\nthey call little chambers, without doors or windows, into which they\r\ncreep horizontally through a very low opening. When they have driven\r\naway the insects by means of a fire of wet brushwood, which emits a\r\ngreat deal of smoke, they close the opening of the oven. The absence\r\nof the mosquitos is purchased dearly enough by the excessive heat of\r\nthe stagnated air, and the smoke of a torch of copal, which lights the\r\noven during your stay in it. M. Bonpland, with courage and patience\r\nwell worthy of praise, dried hundreds of plants, shut up in these\r\nhornitos of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThese precautions of the Indians sufficiently prove that,\r\nnotwithstanding the different organization of the epidermis, the\r\ncopper-coloured man, like the white man, suffers from the stings of\r\ninsects; but the former seems to feel less pain, and the sting is not\r\nfollowed by those swellings which, during several weeks, heighten the\r\nirritability of the skin, and throw persons of a delicate constitution\r\ninto that feverish state which always accompanies eruptive maladies.\r\nWhites born in equinoctial America, and Europeans who have long\r\nsojourned in the Missions, on the borders of forests and great rivers,\r\nsuffer much more than the Indians, but infinitely less than Europeans\r\nnewly arrived. It is not, therefore, as some travellers assert, the\r\nthickness of the skin that renders the sting more or less painful at\r\nthe moment when it is received; nor is it owing to the particular\r\norganization of the integuments, that in the Indians the sting is\r\nfollowed by less of swelling and inflammatory symptoms; it is on the\r\nnervous irritability of the epidermis that the acuteness and duration\r\nof the pain depend. This irritability is augmented by very warm\r\nclothing, by the use of alcoholic liquors, by the habit of scratching\r\nthe wounds, and lastly, (and this physiological observation is the\r\nresult of my own experience,) that of baths repeated at too short\r\nintervals. In places where the absence of crocodiles permits people to\r\nenter a river, M. Bonpland and myself observed that the immoderate use\r\nof baths, while it moderated the pain of old stings of zancudos,\r\nrendered us more sensible to new stings. By bathing more than twice a\r\nday, the skin is brought into a state of nervous irritability, of\r\nwhich no idea can be formed in Europe. It would seem as if all feeling\r\nwere carried toward the integuments.\r\n\r\nAs the mosquitos and gnats pass two-thirds of their lives in the\r\nwater, it is not surprising that these noxious insects become less\r\nnumerous in proportion as you recede from the banks of the great\r\nrivers which intersect the forests. They seem to prefer the spots\r\nwhere their metamorphosis took place, and where they go to deposit\r\ntheir eggs. In fact the wild Indians (Indios monteros) experience the\r\ngreater difficulty in accustoming themselves to the life of the\r\nmissions, as they suffer in the Christian establishments a torment\r\nwhich they scarcely know in their own inland dwellings. The natives at\r\nMaypures, Atures, and Esmeralda, have been seen fleeing to the woods,\r\nor, as they say, al monte, solely from the dread of mosquitos.\r\nUnfortunately, all the Missions of the Orinoco have been established\r\ntoo near the banks of the river. At Esmeralda the inhabitants assured\r\nus that if the village were situated in one of the five plains\r\nsurrounding the high mountains of Duida and Maraguaca, they should\r\nbreathe freely, and enjoy some repose. The great cloud of mosquitos\r\n(la nube de moscas) to use the expression of the monks, is suspended\r\nonly over the Orinoco and its tributary streams, and is dissipated in\r\nproportion as you remove from the rivers. We should form a very\r\ninaccurate idea of Guiana and Brazil, were we to judge of that great\r\nforest four hundred leagues wide, lying between the sources of the\r\nMadeira and the Lower Orinoco, from the valleys of the rivers by which\r\nit is crossed.\r\n\r\nI learned that the little insects of the family of the nemocerae\r\nmigrate from time to time like the alouate monkeys, which live in\r\nsociety. In certain spots, at the commencement of the rainy season,\r\ndifferent species appear, the sting of which has not yet been felt. We\r\nwere informed at the Rio Magdalena, that at Simiti no other culex than\r\nthe jejen was formerly known; and it was then possible to enjoy a\r\ntranquil night's rest, for the jejen is not a nocturnal insect. Since\r\nthe year 1801, the great blue-winged gnat (Culex cyanopterus) has\r\nappeared in such numbers, that the poor inhabitants of Simiti know not\r\nhow to procure an undisturbed sleep. In the marshy channels (esteros)\r\nof the isle of Baru, near Carthagena, is found a little white fly\r\ncalled cafafi. It is scarcely visible to the naked eye, and causes\r\nvery painful swellings. The toldos or cottons used for\r\nmosquito-curtains, are wetted to prevent the cafafi penetrating\r\nthrough the interstices left by the crossing threads. This insect,\r\nhappily rare elsewhere, goes up in January, by the channel (dique) of\r\nMahates, as far as Morales. When we went to this village in the month\r\nof May, we found there cimuliae and zancudos, but no jejens.\r\n\r\nThe insects most troublesome at Orinoco, or as the Creoles say, the\r\nmost ferocious (los mas feroces), are those of the great cataracts of\r\nEsmeralda and Mandavaca. On the Rio Magdalena the Culex cyanopterus is\r\ndreaded, particularly at Mompox, Chiloa, and Tamalameca. At these\r\nplaces this insect is larger and stronger, and its legs blacker. It is\r\ndifficult to avoid smiling on hearing the missionaries dispute about\r\nthe size and voracity of the mosquitos at different parts of the same\r\nriver. In a region the inhabitants of which are ignorant of all that\r\nis passing in the rest of the world, this is the favourite subject of\r\nconversation. \"How I pity your situation!\" said the missionary of the\r\nRaudales to the missionary of Cassiquiare, at our departure; \"you are\r\nalone, like me, in this country of tigers and monkeys; with you fish\r\nis still more rare, and the heat more violent; but as for my mosquitos\r\n(mias moscas) I can boast that with one of mine I would beat three of\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nThis voracity of insects in certain spots, the fury with which they\r\nattack man,* (* This voracity, this appetite for blood, seems\r\nsurprising in little insects, that live on vegetable juices, and in a\r\ncountry almost entirely uninhabited. \"What would these animals eat, if\r\nwe did not pass this way?\" say the Creoles, in going through countries\r\nwhere there are only crocodiles covered with a scaly skin, and hairy\r\nmonkeys.) the activity of the venom varying in the same species, are\r\nvery remarkable facts; which find their analogy, however, in the\r\nclasses of large animals. The crocodile of Angostura pursues men,\r\nwhile at Nueva Barcelona you may bathe tranquilly in the Rio Neveri\r\namidst these carnivorous reptiles. The jaguars of Maturin, Cumanacoa,\r\nand the isthmus of Panama, are timid in comparison of those of the\r\nUpper Orinoco. The Indians well know that the monkeys of some valleys\r\nare easily tamed, while others of the same species, caught elsewhere,\r\nwill rather die of hunger than submit to slavery.* (* I might have\r\nadded the example of the scorpion of Cumana, which it is very\r\ndifficult to distinguish from that of the island of Trinidad, Jamaica,\r\nCarthagena, and Guayaquil; yet the former is not more to be feared\r\nthan the Scorpio europaeus (of the south of France), while the latter\r\nproduces consequences far more alarming than the Scorpio occitanus (of\r\nSpain and Barbary). At Carthagena and Guayaquil, the sting of the\r\nscorpion (alacran) instantly causes the loss of speech. Sometimes a\r\nsingular torpor of the tongue is observed for fifteen or sixteen\r\nhours. The patient, when stung in the legs, stammers as if he had been\r\nstruck with apoplexy.)\r\n\r\nThe common people in America have framed systems respecting the\r\nsalubrity of climates and pathological phenomena, as well as the\r\nlearned of Europe; and their systems, like ours, are diametrically\r\nopposed to each other, according to the provinces into which the New\r\nContinent is divided. At the Rio Magdalena the frequency of mosquitos\r\nis regarded as troublesome, but salutary. These animals, say the\r\ninhabitants, give us slight bleedings, and preserve us, in a country\r\nexcessively hot, from the scarlet fever, and other inflammatory\r\ndiseases. But at the Orinoco, the banks of which are very\r\ninsalubrious, the sick blame the mosquitos for all their sufferings.\r\nIt is unnecessary to refute the fallacy of the popular belief that the\r\naction of the mosquitos is salutary by its local bleedings. In Europe\r\nthe inhabitants of marshy countries are not ignorant that the insects\r\nirritate the epidermis, and stimulate its functions by the venom which\r\nthey deposit in the wounds they make. Far from diminishing the\r\ninflammatory state of the skin, the stings increase it.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of gnats and mosquitos characterises unhealthy climates\r\nonly so far as the development and multiplication of these insects\r\ndepend on the same causes that give rise to miasmata. These noxious\r\nanimals love a fertile soil covered with plants, stagnant waters, and\r\na humid air never agitated by the wind; they prefer to an open country\r\nthose shades, that softened day, that tempered degree of light, heat,\r\nand moisture which, while it favours the action of chemical\r\naffinities, accelerates the putrefaction of organised substances. May\r\nnot the mosquitos themselves increase the insalubrity of the\r\natmosphere? When we reflect that to the height of three or four toises\r\na cubic foot of air is often peopled by a million of winged insects,*\r\n(* It is sufficient to mention, that the cubic foot contains 2,985,984\r\ncubic lines.) which contain a caustic and venomous liquid; when we\r\nrecollect that several species of culex are 1.8 lines long from the\r\nhead to the extremity of the corslet (without reckoning the legs);\r\nlastly, when we consider that in this swarm of mosquitos and gnats,\r\ndiffused in the atmosphere like smoke, there is a great number of dead\r\ninsects raised by the force of the ascending air, or by that of the\r\nlateral currents which are caused by the unequal heating of the soil,\r\nwe are led to inquire whether the presence of so many animal\r\nsubstances in the air must not occasion particular miasmata. I think\r\nthat these substances act on the atmosphere differently from sand and\r\ndust; but it will be prudent to affirm nothing positively on this\r\nsubject. Chemistry has not yet unveiled the numerous mysteries of the\r\ninsalubrity of the air; it has only taught us that we are ignorant of\r\nmany things with which a few years ago we believed we were acquainted.\r\n\r\nDaily experience appears in a certain degree to prove the fact that at\r\nthe Orinoco, Cassiquiare, Rio Caura, and wherever the air is very\r\nunhealthy, the sting of the mosquito augments the disposition of the\r\norgans to receive the impression of miasmata. When you are exposed day\r\nand night, during whole months, to the torment of insects, the\r\ncontinual irritation of the skin causes febrile commotions; and, from\r\nthe sympathy existing between the dermoid and the gastric systems,\r\ninjures the functions of the stomach. Digestion first becomes\r\ndifficult, the cutaneous inflammation excites profuse perspirations,\r\nan unquenchable thirst succeeds, and, in persons of a feeble\r\nconstitution, increasing impatience is succeeded by depression of\r\nmind, during which all the pathogenic causes act with increased\r\nviolence. It is neither the dangers of navigating in small boats, the\r\nsavage Indians, nor the serpents, crocodiles, or jaguars, that make\r\nSpaniards dread a voyage on the Orinoco; it is, as they say with\r\nsimplicity, \"el sudar y las moscas,\" (the perspiration and the flies).\r\nWe have reason to believe that mankind, as they change the surface of\r\nthe soil, will succeed in altering by degrees the constitution of the\r\natmosphere. The insects will diminish when the old trees of the forest\r\nhave disappeared; when, in those countries now desert, the rivers are\r\nseen bordered with cottages, and the plains covered with pastures and\r\nharvests.\r\n\r\nWhoever has lived long in countries infested by mosquitos will be\r\nconvinced, as we were, that there exists no remedy for the torment of\r\nthese insects. The Indians, covered with anoto, bolar earth, or turtle\r\noil, are not protected from their attacks. It is doubtful whether the\r\npainting even relieves: it certainly does not prevent the evil.\r\nEuropeans, recently arrived at the Orinoco, the Rio Magdalena, the\r\nriver Guayaquil, or Rio Chagres (I mention the four rivers where the\r\ninsects are most to be dreaded) at first obtain some relief by\r\ncovering their faces and hands, but they soon feel it difficult to\r\nendure the heat, are weary of being condemned to complete inactivity,\r\nand finish with leaving the face and hands uncovered. Persons who\r\nwould renounce all kind of occupation during the navigation of these\r\nrivers, might bring some particular garment from Europe in the form of\r\na bag, under which they could remain covered, opening it only every\r\nhalf-hour. This bag should be distended by whalebone hoops, for a\r\nclose mask and gloves would be perfectly insupportable. Sleeping on\r\nthe ground, on skins, or in hammocks, we could not make use of\r\nmosquito-curtains (toldos) while on the Orinoco. The toldo is useful\r\nonly where it forms a tent so well closed around the bed that there is\r\nnot the smallest opening by which a gnat can pass. This is difficult\r\nto accomplish; and often when you succeed (for instance, in going up\r\nthe Rio Magdalena, where you travel with some degree of convenience),\r\nyou are forced, in order to avoid being suffocated by the heat, to\r\ncome out from beneath your toldo, and walk about in the open air. A\r\nfeeble wind, smoke, and powerful smells, scarcely afford any relief in\r\nplaces where the insects are very numerous and very voracious. It is\r\nerroneously affirmed that these little animals fly from the peculiar\r\nsmell emitted by the crocodile. We were fear fully stung at Bataillez,\r\nin the road from Carthagena to Honda, while we were dissecting a\r\ncrocodile eleven feet long, the smell of which infested all the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere. The Indians much commend the fumes of burnt\r\ncow-dung. When the wind is very strong, and accompanied by rain, the\r\nmosquitos disappear for some time: they sting most cruelly at the\r\napproach of a storm, particularly when the electric explosions are not\r\nfollowed by heavy showers.\r\n\r\nAnything waved about the head and the hands contributes to chase away\r\nthe insects. \"The more you stir yourself, the less you will be stung,\"\r\nsay the missionaries. The zancudo makes a buzzing before it settles;\r\nbut, when it has assumed confidence, when it has once begun to fix its\r\nsucker, and distend itself, you may touch its wings without its being\r\nfrightened. It remains the whole time with its two hind legs raised;\r\nand, if left to suck to satiety, no swelling takes place, and no pain\r\nis left behind. We often repeated this experiment on ourselves in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Magdalena. It may be asked whether the insect\r\ndeposits the stimulating liquid only at the moment of its flight, when\r\nit is driven away, or whether it draws the liquid up again when left\r\nto suck undisturbed. I incline to this latter opinion; for on quietly\r\npresenting the back of my hand to the Culex cyanopterus, I observed\r\nthat the pain, though violent in the beginning, diminishes in\r\nproportion as the insect continues to suck, and ceases altogether when\r\nit voluntarily flies away. I also wounded my skin with a pin, and\r\nrubbed the pricks with bruised mosquitos, and no swelling ensued. The\r\nirritating liquid, in which chemists have not yet recognized any acid\r\nproperties, is contained, as in the ant and other hymenopterous\r\ninsects, in particular glands; and is probably too much diluted, and\r\nconsequently too much weakened, if the skin be rubbed with the whole\r\nof the bruised insect.\r\n\r\nI have thrown together at the close of this chapter all we learned\r\nduring the course of our travels on phenomena which naturalists have\r\nhitherto singularly neglected, though they exercise a great influence\r\non the welfare of the inhabitants, the salubrity of the climate, and\r\nthe establishment of new colonies on the rivers of equinoctial\r\nAmerica. I might justly have incurred the charge of having treated\r\nthis subject too much in detail, were it not connected with general\r\nphysiological views. Our imagination is struck only by what is great;\r\nbut the lover of natural philosophy should reflect equally on little\r\nthings. We have just seen that winged insects, collected in society,\r\nand concealing in their sucker a liquid that irritates the skin, are\r\ncapable of rendering vast countries almost uninhabitable. Other\r\ninsects equally small, the termites (comejen),* (* Literally, the\r\neaters or the devourers.) create obstacles to the progress of\r\ncivilization, in several hot and temperate parts of the equinoctial\r\nzone, that are difficult to be surmounted. They devour paper,\r\npasteboard, and parchment with frightful rapidity, utterly destroying\r\nrecords and libraries. Whole provinces of Spanish America do not\r\npossess one written document that dates a hundred years back. What\r\nimprovement can the civilization of nations acquire if nothing link\r\nthe present with the past; if the depositories of human knowledge must\r\nbe repeatedly renewed; if the records of genius and reason cannot be\r\ntransmitted to posterity?\r\n\r\nIn proportion as you ascend the table-land of the Andes these evils\r\ndisappear. Man breathes a fresh and pure air. Insects no more disturb\r\nthe labours of the day or the slumbers of the night. Documents can be\r\ncollected in archives without our having to complain of the voracity\r\nof the termites. Mosquitos are no longer feared at a height of two\r\nhundred toises; and the termites, still very frequent at three hundred\r\ntoises of elevation,* (* There are some at Popayan (height 910 toises;\r\nmean temperature 18.7 degrees), but they are species that gnaw wood\r\nonly.) become very rare at Mexico, Santa Fe de Bogota, and Quito. In\r\nthese great capitals, situated on the back of the Cordilleras, we find\r\nlibraries and archives, augmented from day to day by the enlightened\r\nzeal of the inhabitants. These circumstances, combined with others,\r\ninsure a moral preponderance to the Alpine region over the lower\r\nregions of the torrid zone. If we admit, agreeably to the ancient\r\ntraditions collected in both the old and new worlds, that at the time\r\nof the catastrophe which preceded the renewal of our species, man\r\ndescended from the mountains into the plains, we may admit, with still\r\ngreater confidence, that these mountains, the cradle of so many\r\nvarious nations, will for ever remain the centre of human civilization\r\nin the torrid zone. From these fertile and temperate table-lands, from\r\nthese islets scattered in the aerial ocean, knowledge and the\r\nblessings of social institutions will be spread over those vast\r\nforests extending along the foot of the Andes, now inhabited only by\r\nsavage tribes whom the very wealth of nature has retained in indolence\r\nand barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.21.\r\n\r\nRAUDAL OF GARCITA.\r\nMAYPURES.\r\nCATARACTS OF QUITUNA.\r\nMOUTH OF THE VICHADA AND THE ZAMA.\r\nROCK OF ARICAGUA.\r\nSIQUITA.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course to the Puerto de arriba, above the cataract of\r\nAtures, opposite the mouth of the Rio Cataniapo, where our boat was to\r\nbe ready for us. In the narrow path that leads to the embarcadero we\r\nbeheld for the last time the peak of Uniana. It appeared like a cloud\r\nrising above the horizon of the plains. The Guahibos wander at the\r\nfoot of the mountains, and extend their course as far as the banks of\r\nthe Vichada. We were shown at a distance, on the right of the river,\r\nthe rocks that surround the cavern of Ataruipe; but we had not time to\r\nvisit that cemetery of the destroyed tribe of the Atures. Father Zea\r\nhad repeatedly described to us this extraordinary cavern, the\r\nskeletons painted with anoto, the large vases of baked earth, in which\r\nthe bones of separate families appear to be collected; and many other\r\ncurious objects, which we proposed to examine on our return from the\r\nRio Negro. \"You will scarcely believe,\" said the missionaries, \"that\r\nthese skeletons, these painted vases, things which we believed were\r\nunknown to the rest of the world, have brought trouble upon me and my\r\nneighbour, the missionary of Carichana. You have seen the misery in\r\nwhich I live in the raudales. Though devoured by mosquitos, and often\r\nin want of plantains and cassava, yet I have found envious people even\r\nin this country! A white man, who inhabits the pastures between the\r\nMeta and the Apure, denounced me recently in the Audencia of Caracas,\r\nas concealing a treasure I had discovered, jointly with the missionary\r\nof Carichana, amid the tombs of the Indians. It is asserted that the\r\nJesuits of Santa Fe de Bogota were apprised beforehand of the\r\ndestruction of their company; and that, in order to save the riches\r\nthey possessed in money and precious vases, they sent them, either by\r\nthe Rio Meta or the Vichada, to the Orinoco, with orders to have them\r\nhidden in the islets amid the raudales. These treasures I am supposed\r\nto have appropriated unknown to my superiors. The Audencia of Caracas\r\nbrought a complaint before the governor of Guiana, and we were ordered\r\nto appear in person. We uselessly performed a journey of one hundred\r\nand fifty leagues; and, although we declared that we had found in the\r\ncavern only human bones, and dried bats and polecats, commissioners\r\nwere gravely nominated to come hither and search on the spot for the\r\nsupposed treasures of the Jesuits. We shall wait long for these\r\ncommissioners. When they have gone up the Orinoco as far as San Borja,\r\nthe fear of the mosquitos will prevent them from going farther. The\r\ncloud of flies which envelopes us in the raudales is a good defence.\"\r\n\r\nThe account given by the missionary was entirely conformable to what\r\nwe afterwards learned at Angostura from the governor himself.\r\nFortuitous circumstances had given rise to the strangest suspicions.\r\nIn the caverns where the mummies and skeletons of the nation of the\r\nAtures are found, even in the midst of the cataracts, and in the most\r\ninaccessible islets, the Indians long ago discovered boxes bound with\r\niron, containing various European tools, remnants of clothes,\r\nrosaries, and glass trinkets. These objects are thought to have\r\nbelonged to Portuguese traders of the Rio Negro and Grand Para, who,\r\nbefore the establishment of the Jesuits on the banks of the Orinoco,\r\nwent up to Atures by the portages and interior communications of\r\nrivers, to trade with the natives. It is supposed that these men sunk\r\nbeneath the epidemic maladies so common in the raudales, and that\r\ntheir chests became the property of the Indians, the wealthiest of\r\nwhom were usually buried with all they possessed most valuable during\r\ntheir lives. From these very uncertain traditions the tale of hidden\r\ntreasures has been fabricated. As in the Andes of Quito every ruined\r\nbuilding, not excepting the foundations of the pyramids erected by the\r\nFrench savans for the measurement of the meridian, is regarded as Inga\r\npilca,* that is, the work of the Inca (* Pilca (properly in Quichua\r\npirca), wall of the Inca.); so on the Orinoco every hidden treasure\r\ncan belong only to the Jesuits, an order which, no doubt, governed the\r\nmissions better than the Capuchins and the monks of the Observance,\r\nbut whose riches and success in the civilization of the Indians have\r\nbeen much exaggerated. When the Jesuits of Santa Fe were arrested,\r\nthose heaps of piastres, those emeralds of Muzo, those bars of gold of\r\nChoco, which the enemies of the company supposed they possessed, were\r\nnot found in their dwellings. I can cite a respectable testimony,\r\nwhich proves incontestibly, that the viceroy of New Granada had not\r\nwarned the Jesuits of Santa Fe of the danger with which they were\r\nmenaced. Don Vicente Orosco, an engineer officer in the Spanish army,\r\nrelated to me that, being arrived at Angostura, with Don Manuel\r\nCenturion, to arrest the missionaries of Carichana, he met an Indian\r\nboat that was going down the Rio Meta. The boat being manned with\r\nIndians who could speak none of the tongues of the country, gave rise\r\nto suspicions. After useless researches, a bottle was at length\r\ndiscovered, containing a letter, in which the Superior of the company\r\nresiding at Santa Fe informed the missionaries of the Orinoco of the\r\npersecutions to which the Jesuits were exposed in New Grenada. This\r\nletter recommended no measure of precaution; it was short, without\r\nambiguity, and respectful towards the government, whose orders were\r\nexecuted with useless and unreasonable severity.\r\n\r\nEight Indians of Atures had conducted our boat through the raudales,\r\nand seemed well satisfied with the slight recompence we gave them.\r\nThey gain little by this employment; and in order to give a just idea\r\nof the poverty and want of commerce in the missions of the Orinoco, I\r\nshall observe that during three years, with the exception of the boats\r\nsent annually to Angostura by the commander of San Carlos de Rio\r\nNegro, to fetch the pay of the soldiers, the missionary had seen but\r\nfive canoes of the Upper Orinoco pass the cataract, which were bound\r\nfor the harvest of turtles' eggs, and eight boats laden with\r\nmerchandize.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven on the morning of the 17th of April we reached our boat.\r\nFather Zea caused to be embarked, with our instruments, the small\r\nstore of provisions he had been able to procure for the voyage, on\r\nwhich he was to accompany us; these provisions consisted of a few\r\nbunches of plantains, some cassava, and fowls. Leaving the\r\nembarcadero, we immediately passed the mouth of the Cataniapo, a small\r\nriver, the banks of which are inhabited by the Macos, or Piaroas, who\r\nbelong to the great family of the Salive nations.\r\n\r\nBesides the Piaroas of Cataniapo, who pierce their ears, and wear as\r\near-ornaments the teeth of caymans and peccaries, three other tribes\r\nof Macos are known: one, on the Ventuari, above the Rio Mariata; the\r\nsecond, on the Padamo, north of the mountains of Maraguaca; and the\r\nthird, near the Guaharibos, towards the sources of the Orinoco, above\r\nthe Rio Gehette. This last tribe bears the name of Macos-Macos. I\r\ncollected the following words from a young Maco of the banks of the\r\nCataniapo, whom we met near the embarcadero, and who wore in his ears,\r\ninstead of a tusk of the peccary, a large wooden cylinder.* (* This\r\ncustom is observed among the Cabres, the Maypures, and the Pevas of\r\nthe Amazon. These last, described by La Condamine, stretch their ears\r\nby weights of a considerable size.)\r\n\r\nPlantain, Paruru (in Tamanac also, paruru).\r\nCassava, Elente (in Maco, cahig).\r\nMaize, Niarne.\r\nThe sun, Jama (in Salive, mume-seke-cocco).\r\nThe moon, Jama (in Salive, vexio).\r\nWater, Ahia (in Salive, cagua).\r\nOne, Nianti.\r\nTwo, Tajus.\r\nThree, Percotahuja.\r\nFour, Imontegroa.\r\n\r\nThe young man could not reckon as far as five, which certainly is no\r\nproof that the word five does not exist in the Maco tongue. I know not\r\nwhether this tongue be a dialect of the Salive, as is pretty generally\r\nasserted; for idioms derived from one another, sometimes furnish words\r\nutterly different for the most common and most important things.* (*\r\nThe great family of the Esthonian (or Tschoudi) languages, and of the\r\nSamoiede languages, affords numerous examples of these differences.)\r\nBut in discussions on mother-tongues and derivative languages, it is\r\nnot the sounds, the roots only, that are decisive; but rather the\r\ninterior structure and grammatical forms. In the American idioms,\r\nwhich are notwithstanding rich, the moon is commonly enough called the\r\nsun of night or even the sun of sleep; but the moon and sun very\r\nrarely bear the same name, as among the Macos. I know only a few\r\nexamples in the most northerly part of America, among the Woccons, the\r\nOjibbeways, the Muskogulges, and the Mohawks.* (* Nipia-kisathwa in\r\nthe Shawanese (the idiom of Canada), from nippi, to sleep, and\r\nkisathwa, the sun.) Our missionary asserted that jama, in Maco,\r\nindicated at the same time the Supreme Being, and the great orbs of\r\nnight and day; while many other American tongues, for instance the\r\nTamanac, and the Caribbee, have distinct words to denote God, the\r\nMoon, and the Sun. We shall soon see how anxious the missionaries of\r\nthe Orinoco are not to employ, in their translations of the prayers of\r\nthe church, the native words which denote the Divinity, the Creator\r\n(Amanene), the Great Spirit who animates all nature. They choose\r\nrather to Indianize the Spanish word Dios, converting it, according to\r\nthe differences of pronunciation, and the genius of the different\r\ndialects, into Dioso, Tiosu, or Piosu.\r\n\r\nWhen we again embarked on the Orinoco, we found the river free from\r\nshoals. After a few hours we passed the Raudal of Garcita, the rapids\r\nof which are easy of ascent, when the waters are high. To the eastward\r\nis seen a small chain of mountains called the chain of Cumadaminari,\r\nconsisting of gneiss, and not of stratified granite. We were struck\r\nwith a succession of great holes at more than one hundred and eighty\r\nfeet above the present level of the Orinoco, yet which,\r\nnotwithstanding, appear to be the effects of the erosion of the\r\nwaters. We shall see hereafter, that this phenomenon occurs again\r\nnearly at the same height, both in the rocks that border the cataracts\r\nof Maypures, and fifty leagues to the east, near the mouth of the Rio\r\nJao. We slept in the open air, on the left bank of the river, below\r\nthe island of Tomo. The night was beautiful and serene, but the\r\ntorment of the mosquitos was so great near the ground, that I could\r\nnot succeed in levelling the artificial horizon; consequently I lost\r\nthe opportunity of making an observation.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th we set out at three in the morning, to be more sure of\r\narriving before the close of the day at the cataract known by the name\r\nof the Raudal de los Guahibos. We stopped at the mouth of the Rio\r\nTomo. The Indians went on shore, to prepare their food, and take some\r\nrepose. When we reached the foot of the raudal, it was near five in\r\nthe afternoon. It was extremely difficult to go up the current against\r\na mass of water, precipitated from a bank of gneiss several feet high.\r\nAn Indian threw himself into the water, to reach, by swimming, the\r\nrock that divides the cataract into two parts. A rope was fastened to\r\nthe point of this rock, and when the canoe was hauled near enough, our\r\ninstruments, our dry plants, and the provision we had collected at\r\nAtures, were landed in the raudal itself. We remarked with surprise,\r\nthat the natural damn over which the river is precipitated, presents a\r\ndry space of considerable extent; where we stopped to see the boat go\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe rock of gneiss exhibits circular holes, the largest of which are\r\nfour feet deep, and eighteen inches wide. These funnels contain quartz\r\npebbles, and appear to have been formed by the friction of masses\r\nrolled along by the impulse of the waters. Our situation, in the midst\r\nof the cataract, was singular enough, but unattended by the smallest\r\ndanger. The missionary, who accompanied us, had his fever-fit on him.\r\nIn order to quench the thirst by which he was tormented, the idea\r\nsuggested itself to us of preparing a refreshing beverage for him in\r\none of the excavations of the rock. We had taken on board at Atures an\r\nIndian basket called a mapire, filled with sugar, limes, and those\r\ngrenadillas, or fruits of the passion-flower, to which the Spaniards\r\ngive the name of parchas. As we were absolutely destitute of large\r\nvessels for holding and mixing liquids, we poured the water of the\r\nriver, by means of a calabash, into one of the holes of the rock: to\r\nthis we added sugar and lime-juice. In a few minutes we had an\r\nexcellent beverage, which is almost a refinement of luxury, in that\r\nwild spot; but our wants rendered us every day more and more\r\ningenious.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of expectation, we saw the boat arrive above the raudal,\r\nand we were soon ready to depart. After quitting the rock, our passage\r\nwas not exempt from danger. The river is eight hundred toises broad,\r\nand must be crossed obliquely, above the cataract, at the point where\r\nthe waters, impelled by the slope of their bed, rush with extreme\r\nviolence toward the ledge from which they are precipitated. We were\r\novertaken by a storm, accompanied happily by no wind, but the rain\r\nfell in torrents. After rowing for twenty minutes, the pilot declared\r\nthat, far from gaining upon the current, we were again approaching the\r\nraudal. These moments of uncertainty appeared to us very long: the\r\nIndians spoke only in whispers, as they do always when they think\r\ntheir situation perilous. They redoubled their efforts, and we arrived\r\nat nightfall, without any accident, in the port of Maypures.\r\n\r\nStorms within the tropics are as short as they are violent. The\r\nlightning had fallen twice near our boat, and had no doubt struck the\r\nsurface of the water. I mention this phenomenon, because it is pretty\r\ngenerally believed in those countries that the clouds, the surface of\r\nwhich is charged with electricity, are at so great a height that the\r\nlightning reaches the ground more rarely than in Europe. The night was\r\nextremely dark, and we could not in less than two hours reach the\r\nvillage of Maypures. We were wet to the skin. In proportion as the\r\nrain ceased, the zancudos reappeared, with that voracity which\r\ntipulary insects always display immediately after a storm. My\r\nfellow-travellers were uncertain whether it would be best to stop in\r\nthe port or proceed on our way on foot, in spite of the darkness of\r\nthe night. Father Zea was determined to reach his home. He had given\r\ndirections for the construction of a large house of two stories, which\r\nwas to be begun by the Indians of the mission. \"You will there find,\"\r\nsaid he gravely, \"the same conveniences as in the open air; I have\r\nneither a bench nor a table, but you will not suffer so much from the\r\nflies, which are less troublesome in the mission than on the banks of\r\nthe river.\" We followed the counsel if the missionary, who caused\r\ntorches of copal to be lighted. These torches are tubes made of bark,\r\nthree inches in diameter, and filled with copal resin. We walked at\r\nfirst over beds of rock, which were bare and slippery, and then we\r\nentered a thick grove of palm trees. We were twice obliged to pass a\r\nstream on trunks of trees hewn down. The torches had already ceased to\r\ngive light. Being formed on a strange principle, the woody substance\r\nwhich resembles the wick surrounding the resin, they emit more smoke\r\nthan light, and are easily extinguished. The Indian pilot, who\r\nexpressed himself with some facility in Spanish, told us of snakes,\r\nwater-serpents, and tigers, by which we might be attacked. Such\r\nconversations may be expected as matters of course, by persons who\r\ntravel at night with the natives. By intimidating the European\r\ntraveller, the Indians imagine they render themselves more necessary,\r\nand gain the confidence of the stranger. The rudest inhabitant of the\r\nmissions fully understands the deceptions which everywhere arise from\r\nthe relations between men of unequal fortune and civilization. Under\r\nthe absolute and sometimes vexatious government of the monks, the\r\nIndian seeks to ameliorate his condition by those little artifices\r\nwhich are the weapons of physical and intellectual weakness.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived during the night at San Jose de Maypures we were\r\nforcibly struck by the solitude of the place; the Indians were plunged\r\nin profound sleep, and nothing was heard but the cries of nocturnal\r\nbirds, and the distant sound of the cataract. In the calm of the\r\nnight, amid the deep repose of nature, the monotonous sound of a fall\r\nof water has in it something sad and solemn. We remained three days at\r\nMaypures, a small village founded by Don Jose Solano at the time of\r\nthe expedition of the boundaries, the situation of which is more\r\npicturesque, it might be said still more admirable, than that of\r\nAtures.\r\n\r\nThe raudal of Maypures, called by the Indians Quituna, is formed, as\r\nall cataracts are, by the resistance which the river encounters in its\r\nway across a ridge of rocks, or a chain of mountains. The lofty\r\nmountains of Cunavami and Calitamini, between the sources of the\r\nrivers Cataniapo and Ventuari, stretch toward the west in a chain of\r\ngranitic hills. From this chain flow three small rivers, which embrace\r\nin some sort the cataract of Maypures. There are, on the eastern bank,\r\nthe Sanariapo, and on the western, the Cameji and the Toparo. Opposite\r\nthe village of Maypures, the mountains fall back in an arch, and, like\r\na rocky coast, form a gulf open to the south-east. The irruption of\r\nthe river is effected between the mouths of the Toparo and the\r\nSanariapo, at the western extremity of this majestic amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Orinoco now roll at the foot of the eastern chain of\r\nthe mountains, and have receded from the west, where, in a deep\r\nvalley, the ancient shore is easily recognized. A savannah, scarcely\r\nraised thirty feet above the mean level of the river, extends from\r\nthis valley as far as the cataracts. There the small church of\r\nMaypures has been constructed. It is built of trunks of palm-trees,\r\nand is surrounded by seven or eight huts. The dry valley, which runs\r\nin a straight line from south to north, from the Cameji to the Toparo,\r\nis filled with granitic and solitary mounds, all resembling those\r\nfound in the shape of islands and shoals in the present bed of the\r\nriver. I was struck with this analogy of form, on comparing the rocks\r\nof Keri and Oco, situated in the deserted bed of the river, west of\r\nMaypures, with the islets of Ouivitari and Caminitamini, which rise\r\nlike old castles amid the cataracts to the east of the mission. The\r\ngeological aspect of these scenes, the insular form of the elevations\r\nfarthest from the present shore of the Orinoco, the cavities which the\r\nwaves appear to have hollowed in the rock Oco, and which are precisely\r\non the same level (twenty-five or thirty toises high) as the\r\nexcavations perceived opposite to them in the isle of Ouivitari; all\r\nthese appearances prove that the whole of this bay, now dry, was\r\nformerly covered by water. Those waters probably formed a lake, the\r\nnorthern dike preventing their running out: but, when this dike was\r\nbroken down, the savannah that surrounds the mission appeared at first\r\nlike a very low island, bounded by two arms of the same river. It may\r\nbe supposed that the Orinoco continued for some time to fill the\r\nravine, which we shall call the valley of Keri, because it contains\r\nthe rock of that name; and that the waters retired wholly toward the\r\neastern chain, leaving dry the western arm of the river, only as they\r\ngradually diminished. Coloured stripes, which no doubt owe their black\r\ntint to the oxides of iron and manganese, seem to justify this\r\nconjecture. They are found on all the stones, far from the mission,\r\nand indicate the former abode of the waters. In going up the river,\r\nall merchandise is discharged at the confluence of the Rio Toparo and\r\nthe Orinoco. The boats are entrusted to the natives, who have so\r\nperfect a knowledge of the raudal, that they have a particular name\r\nfor every step. They conduct the boats as far as the mouth of the\r\nCameji, where the danger is considered as past.\r\n\r\nI will here describe the cataract of Quituna or Maypures as it\r\nappeared at the two periods when I examined it, in going down and up\r\nthe river. It is formed, like that of Mapara or Atures, by an\r\narchipelago of islands, which, to the length of three thousand toises,\r\nfill the bed of the river, and by rocky dikes, which join the islands\r\ntogether. The most remarkable of these dikes, or natural dams, are\r\nPurimarimi, Manimi, and the Leap of the Sardine (Salto de la Sardina).\r\nI name them in the order in which I saw them in succession from south\r\nto north. The last of these three stages is near nine feet high, and\r\nforms by its breadth a magnificent cascade. I must here repeat,\r\nhowever, that the turbulent shock of the precipitated and broken\r\nwaters depends not so much on the absolute height of each step or\r\ndike, as upon the multitude of counter-currents, the grouping of the\r\nislands and shoals, that lie at the foot of the raudalitos or partial\r\ncascades, and the contraction of the channels, which often do not\r\nleave a free navigable passage of twenty or thirty feet. The eastern\r\npart of the cataract of Maypures is much more dangerous than the\r\nwestern; and therefore the Indian pilots prefer the left bank of the\r\nriver to conduct the boats down or up. Unfortunately, in the season of\r\nlow waters, this bank remains partly dry, and recourse must be had to\r\nthe process of portage; that is, the boats are obliged to be dragged\r\non cylinders, or round logs.\r\n\r\nTo command a comprehensive view of these stupendous scenes, the\r\nspectator must be stationed on the little mountain of Manimi, a\r\ngranitic ridge, which rises from the savannah, north of the church of\r\nthe mission, and is itself only a continuation of the ridges of which\r\nthe raudalito of Manimi is composed. We often visited this mountain,\r\nfor we were never weary of gazing on this astonishing spectacle. From\r\nthe summit of the rock is descried a sheet of foam, extending the\r\nlength of a whole mile. Enormous masses of stone, black as iron, issue\r\nfrom its bosom. Some are paps grouped in pairs, like basaltic hills;\r\nothers resemble towers, fortified castles, and ruined buildings. Their\r\ngloomy tint contrasts with the silvery splendour of the foam. Every\r\nrock, every islet is covered with vigorous trees, collected in\r\nclusters. At the foot of those paps, far as the eye can reach, a thick\r\nvapour is suspended over the river, and through this whitish fog the\r\ntops of the lofty palm-trees shoot up. What name shall we give to\r\nthese majestic plants? I suppose them to be the vadgiai, a new species\r\nof the genus Oreodoxa, the trunk of which is more than eighty feet\r\nhigh. The feathery leaves of this palm-tree have a brilliant lustre,\r\nand rise almost straight toward the sky. At every hour of the day the\r\nsheet of foam displays different aspects. Sometimes the hilly islands\r\nand the palm-trees project their broad shadows; sometimes the rays of\r\nthe setting sun are refracted in the cloud that hangs over the\r\ncataract, and coloured arcs are formed which vanish and appear\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nSuch is the character of the landscape discovered from the top of the\r\nmountain of Manimi, which no traveller has yet described. I do not\r\nhesitate to repeat, that neither time, nor the view of the\r\nCordilleras, nor any abode in the temperate valleys of Mexico, has\r\neffaced from my mind the powerful impression of the aspect of the\r\ncataracts. When I read a description of those places in India that are\r\nembellished by running waters and a vigorous vegetation, my\r\nimagination retraces a sea of foam and palm-trees, the tops of which\r\nrise above a stratum of vapour. The majestic scenes of nature, like\r\nthe sublime works of poetry and the arts, leave remembrances that are\r\nincessantly awakening, and which, through the whole of life, mingle\r\nwith all our feelings of what is grand and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe calm of the atmosphere, and the tumultuous movement of the waters,\r\nproduce a contrast peculiar to this zone. Here no breath of wind ever\r\nagitates the foliage, no cloud veils the splendour of the azure vault\r\nof heaven; a great mass of light is diffused in the air, on the earth\r\nstrewn with plants with glossy leaves, and on the bed of the river,\r\nwhich extends as far as the eye can reach. This appearance surprises\r\nthe traveller born in the north of Europe. The idea of wild scenery,\r\nof a torrent rushing from rock to rock, is linked in his imagination\r\nwith that of a climate where the noise of the tempest is mingled with\r\nthe sound of the cataract; and where, in a gloomy and misty day,\r\nsweeping clouds seem to descend into the valley, and to rest upon the\r\ntops of the pines. The landscape of the tropics in the low regions of\r\nthe continents has a peculiar physiognomy, something of greatness and\r\nrepose, which it preserves even where one of the elements is\r\nstruggling with invincible obstacles. Near the equator, hurricanes and\r\ntempests belong to islands only, to deserts destitute of plants, and\r\nto those spots where parts of the atmosphere repose upon surfaces from\r\nwhich the radiation of heat is very unequal.\r\n\r\nThe mountain of Manimi forms the eastern limit of a plain which\r\nfurnishes for the history of vegetation, that is, for its progressive\r\ndevelopment in bare and desert places, the same phenomena which we\r\nhave described above in speaking of the raudal of Atures. During the\r\nrainy season, the waters heap vegetable earth upon the granitic rock,\r\nthe bare shelves of which extend horizontally. These islands of mould,\r\ndecorated with beautiful and odoriferous plants, resemble the blocks\r\nof granite covered with flowers, which the inhabitants of the Alps\r\ncall gardens or courtils, and which pierce the glaciers of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nIn a place where we had bathed the day before, at the foot of the rock\r\nof Manimi, the Indians killed a serpent seven feet and a half long.\r\nThe Macos called it a camudu. Its back displayed, upon a yellow\r\nground, transverse bands, partly black, and partly inclining to a\r\nbrown green: under the belly the bands were blue, and united in\r\nrhombic spots. This animal, which is not venomous, is said by the\r\nnatives to attain more than fifteen feet in length. I thought at\r\nfirst, that the camudu was a boa; but I saw with surprise, that the\r\nscales beneath the tail were divided into two rows. It was therefore a\r\nviper (coluber); perhaps a python of the New Continent: I say perhaps,\r\nfor great naturalists appear to admit that all the pythons belong to\r\nthe Old, and all the boas to the New World. As the boa of Pliny was a\r\nserpent of Africa and of the south of Europe, it would have been well\r\nif the boas of America had been named pythons, and the pythons of\r\nIndia been called boas. The first notions of an enormous reptile\r\ncapable of seizing man, and even the great quadrupeds, came to us from\r\nIndia and the coast of Guinea. However indifferent names may be, we\r\ncan scarcely admit the idea, that the hemisphere in which Virgil\r\ndescribed the agonies of Laocoon (a fable which the Greeks of Asia\r\nborrowed from much more southern nations) does not possess the\r\nboa-constrictor. I will not augment the confusion of zoological\r\nnomenclature by proposing new changes, and shall confine myself to\r\nobserving that at least the missionaries and the latinized Indians of\r\nthe missions, if not the planters of Guiana, clearly distinguish the\r\ntraga-venados (real boas, with simple anal plates) from the culebras\r\nde agua, or water-snakes, like the camudu (pythons with double anal\r\nscales). The traga-venados have no transverse bands on the back, but a\r\nchain of rhombic or hexagonal spots. Some species prefer the driest\r\nplaces; others love the water, as the pythons, or culebras de agua.\r\n\r\nAdvancing towards the west, we find the hills or islets in the\r\ndeserted branch of the Orinoco crowned with the same palm-trees that\r\nrise on the rocks of the cataracts. One of these hills, called Keri,\r\nis celebrated in the country on account of a white spot which shines\r\nfrom afar, and in which the natives profess to see the image of the\r\nfull moon. I could not climb this steep rock, but I believe the white\r\nspot to be a large nodule of quartz, formed by the union of several of\r\nthose veins so common in granites passing into gneiss. Opposite Keri,\r\nor the Rock of the Moon, on the twin mountain Ouivitari, which is an\r\nislet in the midst of the cataracts, the Indians point out with\r\nmysterious awe a similar white spot. It has the form of a disc; and\r\nthey say this is the image of the sun (Camosi). Perhaps the\r\ngeographical situation of these two objects has contributed to their\r\nhaving received these names. Keri is on the side of the setting,\r\nCamosi on that of the rising sun. Languages being the most ancient\r\nhistorical monuments of nations, some learned men have been singularly\r\nstruck by the analogy between the American word camosi and camosch,\r\nwhich seems to have signified originally, the sun, in one of the\r\nSemitic dialects. This analogy has given rise to hypotheses which\r\nappear to me at least very problematical. The god of the Moabites,\r\nChemosh, or Camosch, who has so wearied the patience of the learned;\r\nApollo Chomens, cited by Strabo and by Ammianus Marcellinus;\r\nBelphegor; Amun or Hamon; and Adonis: all, without doubt, represent\r\nthe sun in the winter solstice; but what can we conclude from a\r\nsolitary and fortuitous resemblance of sounds in languages that have\r\nnothing besides in common?\r\n\r\nThe Maypure tongue is still spoken at Atures, although the mission is\r\ninhabited only by Guahibos and Macos. At Maypures the Guareken and\r\nPareni tongues only are now spoken. From the Rio Anaveni, which falls\r\ninto the Orinoco north of Atures, as far as beyond Jao, and to the\r\nmouth of the Guaviare (between the fourth and sixth degrees of\r\nlatitude), we everywhere find rivers, the termination of which, veni,*\r\n(* Anaveni, Mataveni, Maraveni, etc.) recalls to mind the extent to\r\nwhich the Maypure tongue heretofore prevailed. Veni, or weni,\r\nsignifies water, or a river. The words camosi and keri, which we have\r\njust cited, are of the idiom of the Pareni Indians,* (* Or Parenas,\r\nwho must not be confounded either with the Paravenes of the Rio Caura\r\n(Caulin page 69), or with the Parecas, whose language belongs to the\r\ngreat family of the Tamanac tongues. A young Indian of Maypures, who\r\ncalled himself a Paragini, answered my questions almost in the same\r\nwords that M. Bonpland heard from a Pareni. I have indicated the\r\ndifferences in the table, see below.) who, I think I have heard from\r\nthe natives, lived originally on the banks of the Mataveni.* (* South\r\nof the Rio Zama. We slept in the open air near the mouth of the\r\nMataveni on the 28th day of May, in our return from the Rio Negro.)\r\nThe Abbe Gili considers the Pareni as a simple dialect of the Maypure.\r\nThis question cannot be solved by a comparison of the roots merely.\r\nBeing totally ignorant of the grammatical structure of the Pareni, I\r\ncan raise but feeble doubts against the opinion of the Italian\r\nmissionary. The Pareni is perhaps a mixture of two tongues that belong\r\nto different families; like the Maquiritari, which is composed of the\r\nMaypure and the Caribbee; or, to cite an example better known, the\r\nmodern Persian, which is allied at the same time to the Sanscrit and\r\nto the Semitic tongues. The following are Pareni words, which I\r\ncarefully compared with Maypure words.*\r\n\r\nTABLE OF PARENI AND MAYPURE WORDS COMPARED.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1 : WORD.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 2 : PARENI WORD.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 3 : MAYPURE WORD. (* The words of the Maypure language have\r\nbeen taken from the works of Gili and Hervas. I collected the words\r\nplaced between parentheses from a young Maco Indian, who understood\r\nthe Maypure language.)\r\n\r\nThe sun : Camosi : Kie (Kiepurig).\r\nThe moon : Keri : Kejapi (Cagijapi).\r\nA star : Ouipo : Urrupu.\r\nThe devil : Amethami : Vasuri.\r\nWater : Oneui (ut) : Oueni.\r\nFire : Casi : Catti.\r\nLightning : Eno : Eno-ima.* (* I am ignorant of what ima signifies in\r\nthis compound word. Eno means in Maypure the sky and thunder. Ina\r\nsignifies mother.)\r\nThe head : Ossipo : Nuchibucu.* (* The syllables no and nu, joined to\r\nthe words that designate parts of the body, might have been\r\nsuppressed; they answer to the possessive pronoun my.)\r\nThe hair : Nomao.\r\nThe eyes : Nopurizi : Nupuriki.\r\nThe nose : Nosivi : Nukirri.\r\nThe mouth : Nonoma : Nunumacu.\r\nThe teeth : Nasi : Nati.\r\nThe tongue : Notate : Nuare.\r\nThe ear : Notasine : Nuakini.\r\nThe cheek : Nocaco.\r\nThe neck : Nono : Noinu.\r\nThe arm : Nocano : Nuana.\r\nThe hand : Nucavi : Nucapi.\r\nThe breast : Notoroni.\r\nThe back : Notoli.\r\nThe thigh : Nocazo.\r\nThe nipples : Nocini.\r\nThe foot : Nocizi : Nukii.\r\nThe toes : Nociziriani.\r\nThe calf of the leg : Nocavua.\r\nA crocodile : Cazuiti : Amana.\r\nA fish : Cimasi : Timaki.\r\nMaize : Cana : Jomuki.\r\nPlantain : Paratana (Teot)* : Arata.\r\n(* We may be surprised to find the word teot denote the eminently\r\nnutritive substance that supplies the place of corn (the gift of a\r\nbeneficent divinity), and on which the subsistence of man within the\r\ntropics depends. I may here mention, that the word Teo, or Teot, which\r\nin Aztec signifies God (Teotl, properly Teo, for tl is only a\r\ntermination), is found in the language of the Betoi of the Rio Meta.\r\nThe name of the moon, in this language so remarkable for the\r\ncomplication of its grammatical structure, is Teo-ro. The name of the\r\nsun is Teo-umasoi. The particle ro designates a woman, umasoi a man.\r\nAmong the Betoi, the Maypures, and so many other nations of both\r\ncontinents, the moon is believed to be the wife of the sun. But what\r\nis this root Teo? It appears to me very doubtful, that Teo-ro should\r\nsignify God-woman, for Memelu is the name of the All-powerful Being in\r\nthe Betoi langnage.)\r\nCacao : Cacavua* (* Has this word been introduced from a communication\r\nwith Europeans? It is almost identical with the Mexican (Aztec) word\r\ncacava.).\r\nTobacco : Jema : Jema.\r\nPimento : (Pumake).\r\nMimosa inga : (Caraba).\r\nCecropia peltata : (Jocovi).\r\nAgaric : (Cajuli).\r\nAgaric : Puziana (Pagiana) : Papeta (Popetas).\r\nAgaric : Sinapa (Achinafe) : Avanume (Avanome).\r\nAgaric : Meteuba (Meuteufafa) : Apekiva (Pejiiveji).\r\nAgaric : Puriana vacavi : (Jaliva).\r\nAgaric : Puriana vacavi uschanite.\r\nAgaric : Puriassima vacavi : (Javiji).\r\n\r\nThis comparison seems to prove that the analogies observed in the\r\nroots of the Pareni and the Maypure tongues are not to be neglected;\r\nthey are, however, scarcely more frequent than those that have been\r\nobserved between the Maypure of the Upper Orinoco and the language of\r\nthe Moxos, which is spoken on the banks of the Marmora, from 15 to 20\r\ndegrees of south latitude. The Parenis have in their pronunciation the\r\nEnglish th, or tsa of the Arabians, as I clearly heard in the word\r\nAmethami (devil, evil spirit). I need not again notice the origin of\r\nthe word camosi. Solitary resemblances of sounds are as little proof\r\nof communication between nations as the dissimilitude of a few roots\r\nfurnishes evidence against the affiliation of the German from the\r\nPersian and the Greek. It is remarkable, however, that the names of\r\nthe sun and moon are sometimes found to be identical in languages, the\r\ngrammatical construction of which is entirely different; I may cite as\r\nexamples the Guarany and the Omagua,* languages of nations formerly\r\nvery powerful. (* Sun and Moon, in Guarany, Quarasi and Jasi; in\r\nOmagua, Huarassi and Jase. I shall give, farther on, these same words\r\nin the principal languages of the old and new worlds. See note below.)\r\nIt may be conceived that, with the worship of the stars and of the\r\npowers of nature, words which have a relation to these objects might\r\npass from one idiom to another. I showed the constellation of the\r\nSouthern Cross to a Pareni Indian, who covered the lantern while I was\r\ntaking the circum-meridian heights of the stars; and he called it\r\nBahumehi, a name which the caribe fish, or serra salme, also bears in\r\nPareni. He was ignorant of the name of the belt of Orion; but a\r\nPoignave Indian,* who knew the constellations better, assured me that\r\nin his tongue the belt of Orion bore the name of Fuebot; he called the\r\nmoon Zenquerot. (* At the Orinoco the Puignaves, or Poignaves, are\r\ndistinguished from the Guipunaves (Uipunavi). The latter, on account\r\nof their language, are considered as belonging to the Maypure and\r\nCabre nations; yet water is called in Poignave, as well as in Maypure,\r\noueni.) These two words have a very peculiar character for words of\r\nAmerican origin. As the names of the constellations may have been\r\ntransmitted to immense distances from one nation to another, these\r\nPoignave words have fixed the attention of the learned, who have\r\nimagined they recognize the Phoenician and Moabite tongues in the word\r\ncamosi of the Pareni. Fuebot and zenquerot seem to remind us of the\r\nPhoenician words mot (clay), ardod (oak-tree), ephod, etc. But what\r\ncan we conclude from simple terminations which are most frequently\r\nforeign to the roots? In Hebrew the feminine plurals terminate also in\r\noth. I noted entire phrases in Poignave; but the young man whom I\r\ninterrogated spoke so quick that I could not seize the division of the\r\nwords, and should have mixed them confusedly together had I attempted\r\nto write them down.* (* For a curious example of this, see the speech\r\nof Artabanes in Aristophanes (Acharn. act 1 scene 3) where a Greek has\r\nattempted to give a Persian oration. See also Gibbon's Roman Empire\r\nchapter 53 note 54, for a curious example of the way in which foreign\r\nlanguages have been disfigured when it has been attempted to represent\r\nthem in a totally different tongue.)\r\n\r\nThe Mission near the raudal of Maypures was very considerable in the\r\ntime of the Jesuits, when it reckoned six hundred inhabitants, among\r\nwhom were several families of whites. Under the government of the\r\nFathers of the Observance the population was reduced to less than\r\nsixty. It must be observed that in this part of South America\r\ncultivation has been diminishing for half a century, while beyond the\r\nforests, in the provinces near the sea, we find villages that contain\r\nfrom two or three thousand Indians. The inhabitants of Maypures are a\r\nmild, temperate people, and distinguished by great cleanliness. The\r\nsavages of the Orinoco for the most part have not that inordinate\r\nfondness for strong liquors which prevails in North America. It is\r\ntrue that the Ottomacs, the Jaruros, the Achaguas, and the Caribs, are\r\noften intoxicated by the immoderate use of chiza and many other\r\nfermented liquors, which they know how to prepare with cassava, maize,\r\nand the saccharine fruit of the palm-tree; but travellers have as\r\nusual generalized what belongs only to the manners of some tribes. We\r\nwere frequently unable to prevail upon the Guahibos, or the\r\nMaco-Piroas, to taste brandy while they were labouring for us, and\r\nseemed exhausted by fatigue. It will require a longer residence of\r\nEuropeans in these countries to spread there the vices that are\r\nalready common among the Indians on the coast. In the huts of the\r\nnatives of Maypures we found an appearance of order and neatness,\r\nrarely met with in the houses of the missionaries.\r\n\r\nThese natives cultivate plantains and cassava, but no maize. Cassava,\r\nmade into thin cakes, is the bread of the country. Like the greater\r\npart of the Indians of the Orinoco, the inhabitants of Maypures have\r\nbeverages which may be considered nourishing; one of these, much\r\ncelebrated in that country, is furnished by a palm-tree which grows\r\nwild in the vicinity of the mission on the banks of the Auvana. This\r\ntree is the seje: I estimated the number of flowers on one cluster at\r\nforty-four thousand; and that of the fruit, of which the greater part\r\nfall without ripening, at eight thousand. The fruit is a small fleshy\r\ndrupe. It is immersed for a few minutes in boiling water, to separate\r\nthe kernel from the parenchymatous part of the sarcocarp, which has a\r\nsweet taste, and is pounded and bruised in a large vessel filled with\r\nwater. The infusion yields a yellowish liquor, which tastes like milk\r\nof almonds. Sometimes papelon (unrefined sugar) is added. The\r\nmissionary told us that the natives become visibly fatter during the\r\ntwo or three months in which they drink this seje, into which they dip\r\ntheir cakes of cassava. The piaches, or Indian jugglers, go into the\r\nforests, and sound the botuto (the sacred trumpet) under the seje\r\npalm-trees, to force the tree, they say, to yield an ample produce the\r\nfollowing year. The people pay for this operation, as the Mongols, the\r\nArabs, and nations still nearer to us, pay the chamans, the marabouts,\r\nand other classes of priests, to drive away the white ants and the\r\nlocusts by mystic words or prayers, or to procure a cessation of\r\ncontinued rain, and invert the order of the seasons.\r\n\r\n\"I have a manufacture of pottery in my village,\" said Father Zea, when\r\naccompanying us on a visit to an Indian family, who were occupied in\r\nbaking, by a fire of brushwood, in the open air, large earthen\r\nvessels, two feet and a half high. This branch of manufacture is\r\npeculiar to the various tribes of the great family of Maypures, and\r\nthey appear to have followed it from time immemorial. In every part of\r\nthe forests, far from any human habitation, on digging the earth,\r\nfragments of pottery and delf are found. The taste for this kind of\r\nmanufacture seems to have been common heretofore to the natives of\r\nboth North and South America. To the north of Mexico, on the banks of\r\nthe Rio Gila, among the ruins of an Aztec city; in the United States,\r\nnear the tumuli of the Miamis; in Florida, and in every place where\r\nany traces of ancient civilization are found, the soil covers\r\nfragments of painted pottery; and the extreme resemblance of the\r\nornaments they display is striking. Savage nations, and those\r\ncivilized people* (* The Hindoos, the Tibetians, the Chinese, the\r\nancient Egyptians, the Aztecs, the Peruvians; with whom the tendency\r\ntoward civilization in a body has prevented the free development of\r\nthe faculties of individuals.) who are condemned by their political\r\nand religious institutions always to imitate themselves, strive, as if\r\nby instinct, to perpetuate the same forms, to preserve a peculiar type\r\nor style, and to follow the methods and processes which were employed\r\nby their ancestors. In North America, fragments of delf ware have been\r\ndiscovered in places where there exist lines of fortification, and the\r\nwalls of towns constructed by some unknown nation, now entirely\r\nextinct. The paintings on these fragments have a great similitude to\r\nthose which are executed in our days on earthenware by the natives of\r\nLouisiana and Florida. Thus too, the Indians of Maypures often painted\r\nbefore our eyes the same ornaments as those we had observed in the\r\ncavern of Ataruipe, on the vases containing human bones. They were\r\ngrecques, meanders, and figures of crocodiles, of monkeys, and of a\r\nlarge quadruped which I could not recognize, though it had always the\r\nsame squat form. I might hazard the hypothesis that it belongs to\r\nanother country, and that the type had been brought thither in the\r\ngreat migration of the American nations from the north-west to the\r\nsouth and south-east; but I am rather inclined to believe that the\r\nfigure is intended to represent a tapir, and that the deformed image\r\nof a native animal has become by degrees one of the types that has\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Maypures execute with the greatest skill grecques, or ornaments\r\nformed by straight lines variously combined, similar to those that we\r\nfind on the vases of Magna Grecia, on the Mexican edifices at Mitla,\r\nand in the works of so many nations who, without communication with\r\neach other, find alike a sensible pleasure in the symmetric repetition\r\nof the same forms. Arabesques, meanders, and grecques, please our\r\neyes, because the elements of which their series is composed, follow\r\nin rhythmic order. The eye finds in this order, in the periodical\r\nreturn of the same forms, what the ear distinguishes in the cadenced\r\nsuccession of sounds and concords. Can we then admit a doubt that the\r\nfeeling of rhythm manifests itself in man at the first dawn of\r\ncivilization, and in the rudest essays of poetry and song?\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of Maypures, the making of pottery is an occupation\r\nprincipally confined to the women. They purify the clay by repeated\r\nwashings, form it into cylinders, and mould the largest vases with\r\ntheir hands. The American Indian is unacquainted with the potter's\r\nwheel, which was familiar to the nations of the east in the remotest\r\nantiquity. We may be surprised that the missionaries have not\r\nintroduced this simple and useful machine among the natives of the\r\nOrinoco, yet we must recollect that three centuries have not sufficed\r\nto make it known among the Indians of the peninsula of Araya, opposite\r\nthe port of Cumana. The colours used by the Maypures are the oxides of\r\niron and manganese, and particularly the yellow and red ochres that\r\nare found in the hollows of sandstone. Sometimes the fecula of the\r\nBignonia chica is employed, after the pottery has been exposed to a\r\nfeeble fire. This painting is covered with a varnish of algarobo,\r\nwhich is the transparent resin of the Hymenaea courbaril. The large\r\nvessels in which the chiza is preserved are called ciamacu, the\r\nsmallest bear the name of mucra, from which word the Spaniards of the\r\ncoast have framed murcura. Not only the Maypures, but also the\r\nGuaypunaves, the Caribs, the Ottomacs, and even the Guamos, are\r\ndistinguished at the Orinoco as makers of painted pottery, and this\r\nmanufacture extended formerly towards the banks of the Amazon.\r\nOrellana was struck with the painted ornaments on the ware of the\r\nOmaguas, who in his time were a populous commercial nation.\r\n\r\nThe following facts throw some light on the history of American\r\ncivilization. In the United States, west of the Allegheny mountains,\r\nparticularly between the Ohio and the great lakes of Canada, on\r\ndigging the earth, fragments of painted pottery, mingled with brass\r\ntools, are constantly found. This mixture may well surprise us in a\r\ncountry where, on the first arrival of Europeans, the natives were\r\nignorant of the use of metals. In the forests of South America, which\r\nextend from the equator as far as the eighth degree of north latitude,\r\nfrom the foot of the Andes to the Atlantic, this painted pottery is\r\ndiscovered in the most desert places, but it is found accompanied by\r\nhatchets of jade and other hard stones, skilfully perforated. No\r\nmetallic tools or ornaments have ever been discovered; though in the\r\nmountains on the shore, and at the back of the Cordilleras, the art of\r\nmelting gold and copper, and of mixing the latter metal with tin to\r\nmake cutting instruments, was known. How can we account for these\r\ncontrasts between the temperate and the torrid zone? The Incas of Peru\r\nhad pushed their conquests and their religious wars as far as the\r\nbanks of the Napo and the Amazon, where their language extended over a\r\nsmall space of land; but the civilization of the Peruvians, of the\r\ninhabitants of Quito, and of the Muyscas of New Grenada, never appears\r\nto have had any sensible influence on the moral state of the nations\r\nof Guiana. It must be observed further, that in North America, between\r\nthe Ohio, Miami, and the Lakes, an unknown people, whom systematic\r\nauthors would make the descendants of the Toltecs and Aztecs,\r\nconstructed walls of earth and sometimes of stone without mortar,*\r\nfrom ten to fifteen feet high, and seven or eight thousand feet long.\r\n(* Of siliceous limestone, at Pique, on the Great Miami; of sandstone\r\nat Creek Point, ten leagues from Chillakothe, where the wall is\r\nfifteen hundred toises long.) These singular circumvallations\r\nsometimes enclosed a hundred and fifty acres of ground. In the plains\r\nof the Orinoco, as in those of Marietta, the Miami, and the Ohio, the\r\ncentre of an ancient civilization is found in the west on the back of\r\nthe mountains; but the Orinoco, and the countries lying between that\r\ngreat river and the Amazon, appear never to have been inhabited by\r\nnations whose constructions have resisted the ravages of time. Though\r\nsymbolical figures are found engraved on the hardest rocks, yet\r\nfurther south than eight degrees of latitude, no tumulus, no\r\ncircumvallation, no dike of earth similar to those that exist farther\r\nnorth in the plains of Varinas and Canagua, has been found. Such is\r\nthe contrast that may be observed between the eastern parts of North\r\nand South America, those parts which extend from the table-land of\r\nCundinamarca* (* This is the ancient name of the empire of the Zaques,\r\nfounded by Bochica or Idacanzas, the high priest of Iraca, in New\r\nGrenada.) and the mountains of Cayenne towards the Atlantic, and those\r\nwhich stretch from the Andes of New Spain towards the Alleghenies.\r\nNations advanced in civilization, of which we discover traces on the\r\nbanks of lake Teguyo and in the Casas grandes of the Rio Gila, might\r\nhave sent some tribes eastward into the open countries of the Missouri\r\nand the Ohio, where the climate differs little from that of New\r\nMexico; but in South America, where the great flux of nations has\r\ncontinued from north to south, those who had long enjoyed the mild\r\ntemperature of the back of the equinoctial Cordilleras no doubt\r\ndreaded a descent into burning plains bristled with forests, and\r\ninundated by the periodical swellings of rivers. It is easy to\r\nconceive how much the force of vegetation, and the nature of the soil\r\nand climate, within the torrid zone, embarrassed the natives in regard\r\nto migration in numerous bodies, prevented settlements requiring an\r\nextensive space, and perpetuated the misery and barbarism of solitary\r\nhordes.\r\n\r\nThe feeble civilization introduced in our days by the Spanish monks\r\npursues a retrograde course. Father Gili relates that, at the time of\r\nthe expedition to the boundaries, agriculture began to make some\r\nprogress on the banks of the Orinoco; and that cattle, especially\r\ngoats, had multiplied considerably at Maypures. We found no goats,\r\neither in the mission or in any other village of the Orinoco; they had\r\nall been devoured by the tigers. The black and white breeds of pigs\r\nonly, the latter of which are called French pigs (puercos franceses),\r\nbecause they are believed to have come from the Caribbee Islands, have\r\nresisted the pursuit of wild beasts. We saw with much pleasure\r\nguacamayas, or tame macaws, round the huts of the Indians, and flying\r\nto the fields like our pigeons. This bird is the largest and most\r\nmajestic species of parrot with naked cheeks that we found in our\r\ntravels. It is called in Marativitan, cahuei. Including the tail, it\r\nis two feet three inches long. We had observed it also on the banks of\r\nthe Atabapo, the Temi, and the Rio Negro. The flesh of the cahuei,\r\nwhich is frequently eaten, is black and somewhat tough. These macaws,\r\nwhose plumage glows with vivid tints of purple, blue, and yellow, are\r\na great ornament to the Indian farm-yards; they do not yield in beauty\r\nto the peacock, the golden pheasant, the pauxi, or the alector. The\r\npractice of rearing parrots, birds of a family so different from the\r\ngallinaceous tribes, was remarked by Columbus. When he discovered\r\nAmerica he saw macaws, or large parrots, which served as food to the\r\nnatives of the Caribbee Islands, instead of fowls.\r\n\r\nA majestic tree, more than sixty feet high, which the planters call\r\nfruta de burro, grows in the vicinity of the little village of\r\nMaypures. It is a new species of the unona, and has the stateliness of\r\nthe Uvaria zeylanica of Aublet. Its branches are straight, and rise in\r\na pyramid, nearly like the poplar of the Mississippi, erroneously\r\ncalled the Lombardy poplar. The tree is celebrated for its aromatic\r\nfruit, the infusion of which is a powerful febrifuge. The poor\r\nmissionaries of the Orinoco, who are afflicted with tertian fevers\r\nduring a great part of the year, seldom travel without a little bag\r\nfilled with frutas de burro. I have already observed that between the\r\ntropics, the use of aromatics, for instance very strong coffee, the\r\nCroton cascarilla, or the pericarp of the Unona xylopioides, is\r\ngenerally preferred to that of the astringent bark of cinchona, or of\r\nBonplandia trifolatia, which is the Angostura bark. The people of\r\nAmerica have the most inveterate prejudice against the employment of\r\ndifferent kinds of cinchona; and in the very countries where this\r\nvaluable remedy grows, they try (to use their own phrase) to cut off\r\nthe fever, by infusions of Scoparia dulcis, and hot lemonade prepared\r\nwith sugar and the small wild lime, the rind of which is equally oily\r\nand aromatic.\r\n\r\nThe weather was unfavourable for astronomical observations. I\r\nobtained, however, on the 20th of April, a good series of\r\ncorresponding altitudes of the sun, according to which the chronometer\r\ngave 70 degrees 37 minutes 33 seconds for the longitude of the mission\r\nof Maypures; the latitude was found, by a star observed towards the\r\nnorth, to be 5 degrees 13 minutes 57 seconds; and by a star observed\r\ntowards the south, 5 degrees 13 minutes 7 seconds. The error of the\r\nmost recent maps is half a degree of longitude and half a degree of\r\nlatitude. It would be difficult to relate the trouble and torments\r\nwhich these nocturnal observations cost us. Nowhere is a denser cloud\r\nof mosquitos to be found. It formed, as it were, a particular stratum\r\nsome feet above the ground, and it thickened as we brought lights to\r\nillumine our artificial horizon. The inhabitants of Maypures, for the\r\nmost part, quit the village to sleep in the islets amid the cataracts,\r\nwhere the number of insects is less; others make a fire of brushwood\r\nin their huts, and suspend their hammocks in the midst of the smoke.\r\n\r\nWe spent two days and a half in the little village of Maypures, on the\r\nbanks of the great Upper Cataract, and on the 21st April we embarked\r\nin the canoe we had obtained from the missionary of Carichana. It was\r\nmuch damaged by the shoals it had struck against, and the carelessness\r\nof the Indians; but still greater dangers awaited it. It was to be\r\ndragged over land, across an isthmus of thirty-six thousand feet; from\r\nthe Rio Tuamini to the Rio Negro, to go up by the Cassiquiare to the\r\nOrinoco, and to repass the two raudales.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller has passed the Great Cataracts, he feels as if he\r\nwere in a new world, and had overstepped the barriers which nature\r\nseems to have raised between the civilized countries of the coast and\r\nthe savage and unknown interior. Towards the east, in the bluish\r\ndistance, we saw for the last time the high chain of the Cunavami\r\nmountains. Its long, horizontal ridge reminded us of the Mesa of the\r\nBrigantine, near Cumana; but it terminates by a truncated summit. The\r\nPeak of Calitamini (the name given to this summit) glows at sunset as\r\nwith a reddish fire. This appearance is every day the same. No one\r\never approached this mountain, the height of which does not exceed six\r\nhundred toises. I believe this splendour, commonly reddish but\r\nsometimes silvery, to be a reflection produced by large plates of\r\ntalc, or by gneiss passing into mica-slate. The whole of this country\r\ncontains granitic rocks, on which here and there, in little plains, an\r\nargillaceous grit-stone immediately reposes, containing fragments of\r\nquartz and of brown iron-ore.\r\n\r\nIn going to the embarcadero, we caught on the trunk of a hevea* (* One\r\nof those trees whose milk yields caoutchouc.) a new species of\r\ntree-frog, remarkable for its beautiful colours; it had a yellow\r\nbelly, the back and head of a fine velvety purple, and a very narrow\r\nstripe of white from the point of the nose to the hinder extremities.\r\nThis frog was two inches long, and allied to the Rana tinctoria, the\r\nblood of which, it is asserted, introduced into the skin of a parrot,\r\nin places where the feathers have been plucked out, occasions the\r\ngrowth of frizzled feathers of a yellow or red colour. The Indians\r\nshowed us on the way, what is no doubt very curious in that country,\r\ntraces of cartwheels in the rock. They spoke, as of an unknown animal,\r\nof those beasts with large horns, which, at the time of the expedition\r\nto the boundaries, drew the boats through the valley of Keri, from the\r\nRio Toparo to the Rio Cameji, to avoid the cataracts, and save the\r\ntrouble of unloading the merchandize. I believe these poor inhabitants\r\nof Maypures would now be as much astonished at the sight of an ox of\r\nthe Spanish breed, as the Romans were at the sight of the Lucanian\r\noxen, as they called the elephants of the army of Pyrrhus.\r\n\r\nWe embarked at Puerto de Arriba, and passed the Raudal de Cameji with\r\nsome difficulty. This passage is reputed to be dangerous when the\r\nwater is very high; but we found the surface of the river beyond the\r\nraudal as smooth as glass. We passed the night in a rocky island\r\ncalled Piedra Raton, which is three-quarters of a league long, and\r\ndisplays that singular aspect of rising vegetation, those clusters of\r\nshrubs, scattered over a bare and rocky soil, of which we have often\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of April we departed an hour and a half before sunrise.\r\nThe morning was humid but delicious; not a breath of wind was felt;\r\nfor south of Atures and Maypures a perpetual calm prevails. On the\r\nbanks of the Rio Negro and the Cassiquiare, at the foot of Cerro\r\nDuida, and at the mission of Santa Barbara, we never heard that\r\nrustling of the leaves which has such a peculiar charm in very hot\r\nclimates. The windings of rivers, the shelter of mountains, the\r\nthickness of the forests, and the almost continual rains, at one or\r\ntwo degrees of latitude north of the equator, contribute no doubt to\r\nthis phenomenon, which is peculiar to the missions of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the valley of the Amazon which is south of the\r\nequator, but at the same distance from it, as the places just\r\nmentioned, a strong wind always rises two hours after mid-day. This\r\nwind blows constantly against the stream, and is felt only in the bed\r\nof the river. Below San Borja it is an easterly wind; at Tomependa I\r\nfound it between north and north-north-east; it is still the same\r\nbreeze, the wind of the rotation of the globe, but modified by slight\r\nlocal circumstances. By favour of this general breeze you may go up\r\nthe Amazon under sail, from Grand Para as far as Tefe, a distance of\r\nseven hundred and fifty leagues. In the province of Jaen de\r\nBracamoros, at the foot of the western declivity of the Cordilleras,\r\nthis Atlantic breeze rises sometimes to a tempest.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the great salubrity of the Amazon is owing\r\nto this constant breeze. In the stagnant air of the Upper Orinoco the\r\nchemical affinities act more powerfully, and more deleterious miasmata\r\nare formed. The insalubrity of the climate would be the same on the\r\nwoody banks of the Amazon, if that river, running like the Niger from\r\nwest to east, did not follow in its immense length the same direction,\r\nwhich is that of the trade-winds. The valley of the Amazon is closed\r\nonly at its western extremity, where it approaches the Cordilleras of\r\nthe Andes. Towards the east, where the sea-breeze strikes the New\r\nContinent, the shore is raised but a few feet above the level of the\r\nAtlantic. The Upper Orinoco first runs from east to west, and then\r\nfrom north to south. Where its course is nearly parallel to that of\r\nthe Amazon, a very hilly country (the group of the mountains of Parima\r\nand of Dutch and French Guiana) separates it from the Atlantic, and\r\nprevents the wind of rotation from reaching Esmeralda. This wind\r\nbegins to be powerfully felt only from the confluence of the Apure,\r\nwhere the Lower Orinoco runs from west to east in a vast plain open\r\ntowards the Atlantic, and therefore the climate of this part of the\r\nriver is less noxious than that of the Upper Orinoco.\r\n\r\nIn order to add a third point of comparison, I may mention the valley\r\nof the Rio Magdalena, which, like the Amazon, has one direction only,\r\nbut unfortunately, instead of being that of the breeze, it is from\r\nsouth to north. Situated in the region of the trade-winds, the Rio\r\nMagdalena has the stagnant air of the Upper Orinoco. From the canal of\r\nMahates as far as Honda, particularly south of the town of Mompox, we\r\nnever felt the wind blow but at the approach of the evening storms.\r\nWhen, on the contrary, you proceed up the river beyond Honda, you find\r\nthe atmosphere often agitated. The strong winds that are ingulfed in\r\nthe valley of Neiva are noted for their excessive heat. We may be at\r\nfirst surprised to perceive that the calm ceases as we approach the\r\nlofty mountains in the upper course of the river, but this\r\nastonishment ends when we recollect that the dry and burning winds of\r\nthe Llanos de Neiva are the effect of descending currents. The columns\r\nof cold air rush from the top of the Nevados of Quindiu and of\r\nGuanacas into the valley, driving before them the lower strata of the\r\natmosphere. Everywhere the unequal heating of the soil, and the\r\nproximity of mountains covered with perpetual snow, cause partial\r\ncurrents within the tropics, as well as in the temperate zone. The\r\nviolent winds of Neiva are not the effect of a repercussion of the\r\ntrade-winds; they rise where those winds cannot penetrate; and if the\r\nmountains of the Upper Orinoco, the tops of which are generally\r\ncrowned with trees, were more elevated, they would produce the same\r\nimpetuous movements in the atmosphere as we observe in the Cordilleras\r\nof Peru, of Abyssinia, and of Thibet. The intimate connection that\r\nexists between the direction of rivers, the height and disposition of\r\nthe adjacent mountains, the movements of the atmosphere, and the\r\nsalubrity of the climate, are subjects well worthy of attention. The\r\nstudy of the surface and the inequalities of the soil would indeed be\r\nirksome and useless were it not connected with more general\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of six miles from the island of Piedra Raton we\r\npassed, first, on the east, the mouth of the Rio Sipapo, called Tipapu\r\nby the Indians; and then, on the west, the mouth of the Rio Vichada.\r\nNear the latter are some rocks covered by the water, that form a small\r\ncascade or raudalito. The Rio Sipapo, which Father Gili went up in\r\n1757, and which he says is twice as broad as the Tiber, comes from a\r\nconsiderable chain of mountains, which in its southern part bears the\r\nname of the river, and joins the group of Calitamini and of Cunavami.\r\nNext to the Peak of Duida, which rises above the mission of Esmeralda,\r\nthe Cerros of Sipapo appeared to me the most lofty of the whole\r\nCordillera of Parima. They form an immense wall of rocks, shooting up\r\nabruptly from the plain, its craggy ridge of running from\r\nsouth-south-east to north-north-west. I believe these crags, these\r\nindentations, which equally occur in the sandstone of Montserrat in\r\nCatalonia,* (* From them the name of Montserrat is derived, Monte\r\nSerrato signifying a mountain ridged or jagged like a saw.) are owing\r\nto blocks of granite heaped together. The Cerros de Sipapo wear a\r\ndifferent aspect every hour of the day. At sunrise the thick\r\nvegetation with which these mountains are clothed is tinged with that\r\ndark green inclining to brown, which is peculiar to a region where\r\ntrees with coriaceous leaves prevail. Broad and strong shadows are\r\nprojected on the neighbouring plain, and form a contrast with the\r\nvivid light diffused over the ground, in the air, and on the surface\r\nof the waters. But towards noon, when the sun reaches its zenith,\r\nthese strong shadows gradually disappear, and the whole group is\r\nveiled by an aerial vapour of a much deeper azure than that of the\r\nlower regions of the celestial vault. These vapours, circulating\r\naround the rocky ridge, soften its outline, temper the effects of the\r\nlight, and give the landscape that aspect of calmness and repose which\r\nin nature, as in the works of Claude Lorraine and Poussin, arises from\r\nthe harmony of forms and colours.\r\n\r\nCruzero, the powerful chief of the Guaypunaves, long resided behind\r\nthe mountains of Sipapo, after having quitted with his warlike horde\r\nthe plains between the Rio Inirida and the Chamochiquini. The Indians\r\ntold us that the forests which cover the Sipapo abound in the climbing\r\nplant called vehuco de maimure. This species of liana is celebrated\r\namong the Indians, and serves for making baskets and weaving mats. The\r\nforests of Sipapo are altogether unknown, and there the missionaries\r\nplace the nation of the Rayas,* whose mouths are believed to be in\r\ntheir navels.\r\n\r\n(* Rays, on account of the pretended analogy with the fish of this\r\nname, the mouth of which seems as if forced downwards below the body.\r\nThis singular legend has been spread far and wide over the earth.\r\nShakespeare has described Othello as recounting marvellous tales:\r\n\r\n\"of cannibals that do each other eat:\r\nOf Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\r\nDo grow beneath their shoulders.\")\r\n\r\nAn old Indian, whom we met at Carichana, and who boasted of having\r\noften eaten human flesh, had seen these acephali \"with his own eyes.\"\r\nThese absurd fables are spread as far as the Llanos, where you are not\r\nalways permitted to doubt the existence of the Raya Indians. In every\r\nzone intolerance accompanies credulity; and it might be said that the\r\nfictions of ancient geographers had passed from one hemisphere to the\r\nother, did we not know that the most fantastic productions of the\r\nimagination, like the works of nature, furnish everywhere a certain\r\nanalogy of aspect and of form.\r\n\r\nWe landed at the mouth of the Rio Vichada or Visata to examine the\r\nplants of that part of the country. The scenery is very singular. The\r\nforest is thin, and an innumerable quantity of small rocks rise from\r\nthe plain. These form massy prisms, ruined pillars, and solitary\r\ntowers fifteen or twenty feet high. Some are shaded by the trees of\r\nthe forest, others have their summits crowned with palms. These rocks\r\nare of granite passing into gneiss. At the confluence of the Vichada\r\nthe rocks of granite, and what is still more remarkable, the soil\r\nitself, are covered with moss and lichens. These latter resemble the\r\nCladonia pyxidata and the Lichen rangiferinus, so common in the north\r\nof Europe. We could scarcely persuade ourselves that we were elevated\r\nless than one hundred toises above the level of the sea, in the fifth\r\ndegree of latitude, in the centre of the torrid zone, which has so\r\nlong been thought to be destitute of cryptogamous plants. The mean\r\ntemperature of this shady and humid spot probably exceeds twenty-six\r\ndegrees of the centigrade thermometer. Reflecting on the small\r\nquantity of rain which had hitherto fallen, we were surprised at the\r\nbeautiful verdure of the forests. This peculiarity characterises the\r\nvalley of the Upper Orinoco; on the coast of Caracas, and in the\r\nLlanos, the trees in winter (in the season called summer in South\r\nAmerica, north of the equator) are stripped of their leaves, and the\r\nground is covered only with yellow and withered grass. Between the\r\nsolitary rocks just described arise some high plants of columnar\r\ncactus (Cactus septemangularis), a very rare appearance south of the\r\ncataracts of Atures and Maypures.\r\n\r\nAmid this picturesque scene M. Bonpland was fortunate enough to find\r\nseveral specimens of Laurus cinnamomoides, a very aromatic species of\r\ncinnamon, known at the Orinoco by the names of varimacu and of\r\ncanelilla.* (* The diminutive of the Spanish word canela, which\r\nsignifies cinnamon.) This valuable production is found also in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Caura, as well as near Esmeralda, and eastward of\r\nthe Great Cataracts. The Jesuit Francisco de Olmo appears to have been\r\nthe first who discovered the canelilla, which he did in the country of\r\nthe Piaroas, near the sources of the Cataniapo. The missionary Gili,\r\nwho did not advance so far as the regions I am now describing, seems\r\nto confound the varimacu, or guarimacu, with the myristica, or\r\nnutmeg-tree of America. These barks and aromatic fruits, the cinnamon,\r\nthe nutmeg, the Myrtus pimenta, and the Laurus pucheri, would have\r\nbecome important objects of trade, if Europe, at the period of the\r\ndiscovery of the New World, had not already been accustomed to the\r\nspices and aromatics of India. The cinnamon of the Orinoco, and that\r\nof the Andaquies missions, are, however, less aromatic than the\r\ncinnamon of Ceylon, and would still be so even if dried and prepared\r\nby similar processes.\r\n\r\nEvery hemisphere produces plants of a different species; and it is not\r\nby the diversity of climates that we can attempt to explain why\r\nequinoctial Africa has no laurels, and the New World no heaths; why\r\ncalceolariae are found wild only in the southern hemisphere; why the\r\nbirds of the East Indies glow with colours less splendid than those of\r\nthe hot parts of America; finally, why the tiger is peculiar to Asia,\r\nand the ornithorynchus to Australia. In the vegetable as well as in\r\nthe animal kingdom, the causes of the distribution of the species are\r\namong the mysteries which natural philosophy cannot solve. The\r\nattempts made to explain the distribution of various species on the\r\nglobe by the sole influence of climate, take their date from a period\r\nwhen physical geography was still in its infancy; when, recurring\r\nincessantly to pretended contrasts between the two worlds, it was\r\nimagined that the whole of Africa and of America resembled the deserts\r\nof Egypt and the marshes of Cayenne. At present, when men judge of the\r\nstate of things not from one type arbitrarily chosen, but from\r\npositive knowledge, it is ascertained that the two continents, in\r\ntheir immense extent, contain countries that are altogether analogous.\r\nThere are regions of America as barren and burning as the interior of\r\nAfrica. Those islands which produce the spices of India are scarcely\r\nremarkable for their dryness; and it is not on account of the humidity\r\nof the climate, as has been affirmed in recent works, that the New\r\nContinent is deprived of those fine species of lauriniae and\r\nmyristicae, which are found united in one little corner of the earth\r\nin the archipelago of India. For some years past cinnamon has been\r\ncultivated with success in several parts of the New Continent; and a\r\nzone that produces the coumarouna, the vanilla, the pucheri, the\r\npine-apple, the pimento, the balsam of tolu, the Myroxylon peruvianum,\r\nthe croton, the citroma, the pejoa, the incienso of the Silla of\r\nCaracas, the quereme, the pancratium, and so many majestic liliaceous\r\nplants, cannot be considered as destitute of aromatics. Besides, a dry\r\nair favours the development of the aromatic or exciting properties,\r\nonly in certain species of plants. The most inveterate poisons are\r\nproduced in the most humid zone of America; and it is precisely under\r\nthe influence of the long rains of the tropics that the American\r\npimento (Capsicum baccatum), the fruit of which is often as caustic\r\nand fiery as Indian pepper, vegetates best. From all these\r\nconsiderations it follows, first, that the New Continent possesses\r\nspices, aromatics, and very active vegetable poisons, peculiar to\r\nitself, and differing specifically from those of the Old World;\r\nsecondly, that the primitive distribution of species in the torrid\r\nzone cannot be explained by the influence of climate solely, or by the\r\ndistribution of temperature, which we observe in the present state of\r\nour planet; but that this difference of climates leads us to perceive\r\nwhy a given type of organization develops itself more vigorously in\r\nsuch or such local circumstances. We can conceive that a small number\r\nof the families of plants, for instance the musaceae and the palms,\r\ncannot belong to very cold regions, on account of their internal\r\nstructure, and the importance of certain organs; but we cannot explain\r\nwhy no one of the family of the Melastomaceae vegetates north of the\r\nparallel of the thirtieth degree of latitude, or why no rose-tree\r\nbelongs to the southern hemisphere. Analogy of climates is often found\r\nin the two continents, without identity of productions.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Vichada, which has a small raudal at its confluence with the\r\nOrinoco, appeared to me, next to the Meta and the Guaviare, to be the\r\nmost considerable river coming from the west. During the last forty\r\nyears no European has navigated the Vichada. I could learn nothing of\r\nits sources; they rise, I believe, with those of the Tomo, in the\r\nplains that extend to the south of Casimena. Fugitive Indians of Santa\r\nRosalia de Cabapuna, a village situate on the banks of the Meta, have\r\narrived even recently, by the Rio Vichada, at the cataract of\r\nMaypures; which sufficiently proves that the sources of this river are\r\nnot very distant from the Meta. Father Gumilla has preserved the names\r\nof several German and Spanish Jesuits, who in 1734 fell victims to\r\ntheir zeal for religion, by the hands of the Caribs on the now desert\r\nbanks of the Vichada.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the Cano Pirajavi on the east, and then a small river on\r\nthe west, which issues, as the Indians say, from a lake called Nao, we\r\nrested for the night on the shore of the Orinoco, at the mouth of the\r\nZama, a very considerable river, but as little known as the Vichada.\r\nNotwithstanding the black waters of the Zama, we suffered greatly from\r\ninsects. The night was beautiful, without a breath of wind in the\r\nlower regions of the atmosphere, but towards two in the morning we saw\r\nthick clouds crossing the zenith rapidly from east to west. When,\r\ndeclining toward the horizon, they traversed the great nebulae of\r\nSagittarius and the Ship, they appeared of a dark blue. The light of\r\nthe nebulae is never more splendid than when they are in part covered\r\nby sweeping clouds. We observe the same phenomenon in Europe in the\r\nMilky Way, in the aurora borealis when it beams with a silvery light;\r\nand at the rising and setting of the sun in that part of the sky that\r\nis whitened* from causes which philosophers have not yet sufficiently\r\nexplained. (* The dawn: in French aube (alba, albente coelo.))\r\n\r\nThe vast tract of country lying between the Meta, the Vichada, and the\r\nGuaviare, is altogether unknown a league from the banks; but it is\r\nbelieved to be inhabited by wild Indians of the tribe of Chiricoas,\r\nwho fortunately build no boats. Formerly, when the Caribs, and their\r\nenemies the Cabres, traversed these regions with their little fleets\r\nof rafts and canoes, it would have been imprudent to have passed the\r\nnight near the mouth of a river running from the west. The little\r\nsettlements of the Europeans having now caused the independent Indians\r\nto retire from the banks of the Upper Orinoco, the solitude of these\r\nregions is such, that from Carichana to Javita, and from Esmeralda to\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo, during a course of one hundred and eighty\r\nleagues, we did not meet a single boat.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Rio Zama we approach a class of rivers, that\r\nmerits great attention. The Zama, the Mataveni, the Atabapo, the\r\nTuamini, the Temi, and the Guainia, are aguas negras, that is, their\r\nwaters, seen in a large body, appear brown like coffee, or of a\r\ngreenish black. These waters, notwithstanding, are most beautiful,\r\nclear, and agreeable to the taste. I have observed above, that the\r\ncrocodiles, and, if not the zancudos, at least the mosquitos,\r\ngenerally shun the black waters. The people assert too, that these\r\nwaters do not colour the rocks; and that the white rivers have black\r\nborders, while the black rivers have white. In fact, the shores of the\r\nGuainia, known to Europeans by the name of the Rio Negro, frequently\r\nexhibit masses of quartz issuing from granite, and of a dazzling\r\nwhiteness. The waters of the Mataveni, when examined in a glass, are\r\npretty white; those of the Atabapo retain a slight tinge of\r\nyellowish-brown. When the least breath of wind agitates the surface of\r\nthese black rivers they appear of a fine grass-green, like the lakes\r\nof Switzerland. In the shade, the Zama, the Atabapo, and the Guainia,\r\nare as dark as coffee-grounds. These phenomena are so striking, that\r\nthe Indians everywhere distinguish the waters by the terms black and\r\nwhite. The former have often served me for an artificial horizon; they\r\nreflect the image of the stars with admirable clearness.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the waters of springs, rivers, and lakes, ranks among\r\nthose physical problems which it is difficult, if not impossible, to\r\nsolve by direct experiments. The tints of reflected light are\r\ngenerally very different from the tints of transmitted light;\r\nparticularly when the transmission takes place through a great portion\r\nof fluid. If there were no absorption of rays, the transmitted light\r\nwould be of a colour corresponding with that of the reflected light;\r\nand in general we judge imperfectly of transmitted light, by filling\r\nwith water a shallow glass with a narrow aperture. In a river, the\r\ncolour of the reflected light comes to us always from the interior\r\nstrata of the fluid, and not from the upper stratum.\r\n\r\nSome celebrated naturalists, who have examined the purest waters of\r\nthe glaciers, and those which flow from mountains covered with\r\nperpetual snow, where the earth is destitute of the relics of\r\nvegetation, have thought that the proper colour of water might be\r\nblue, or green. Nothing, in fact, proves, that water is by nature\r\nwhite; and we must always admit the presence of a colouring principle,\r\nwhen water viewed by reflection is coloured. In the rivers that\r\ncontain a colouring principle, that principle is generally so little\r\nin quantity, that it eludes all chemical research. The tints of the\r\nocean seem often to depend neither on the nature of the bottom, nor on\r\nthe reflection of the sky on the clouds. Sir Humphrey Davy was of\r\nopinion that the tints of different seas may very likely be owing to\r\ndifferent proportions of iodine.\r\n\r\nOn consulting the geographers of antiquity, we find that the Greeks\r\nhad noticed the blue waters of Thermopylae, the red waters of Joppa,\r\nand the black waters of the hot-baths of Astyra, opposite Lesbos. Some\r\nrivers, the Rhone for instance, near Geneva, have a decidedly blue\r\ncolour. It is said, that the snow-waters of the Alps are sometimes of\r\na dark emerald green. Several lakes of Savoy and of Peru have a brown\r\ncolour approaching black. Most of these phenomena of coloration are\r\nobserved in waters that are believed to be the purest; and it is\r\nrather from reasonings founded on analogy, than from any direct\r\nanalysis, that we may throw any light on so uncertain a matter. In the\r\nvast system of rivers near the mouth of the Rio Zama, a fact which\r\nappears to me remarkable is, that the black waters are principally\r\nrestricted to the equatorial regions. They begin about five degrees of\r\nnorth latitude; and abound thence to beyond the equator as far as\r\nabout two degrees of south latitude. The mouth of the Rio Negro is\r\nindeed in the latitude of 3 degrees 9 minutes; but in this interval\r\nthe black and white waters are so singularly mingled in the forests\r\nand the savannahs, that we know not to what cause the coloration must\r\nbe attributed. The waters of the Cassiquiare, which fall into the Rio\r\nNegro, are as white as those of the Orinoco, from which it issues. Of\r\ntwo tributary streams of the Cassiquiare very near each other, the\r\nSiapa and the Pacimony, one is white, the other black.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians are interrogated respecting the causes of these\r\nstrange colorations, they answer, as questions in natural philosophy\r\nor physiology are sometimes answered in Europe, by repeating the fact\r\nin other terms. If you address yourself to the missionaries, they\r\nreply, as if they had the most convincing proofs of the fact, that the\r\nwaters are coloured by washing the roots of the sarsaparilla. The\r\nSmilaceae no doubt abound on the banks of the Rio Negro, the Pacimony,\r\nand the Cababury; their roots, macerated in the water, yield an\r\nextractive matter, that is brown, bitter, and mucilaginous; but how\r\nmany tufts of smilax have we seen in places, where the waters were\r\nentirely white. In the marshy forest which we traversed, to convey our\r\ncanoe from the Rio Tuamini to the Cano Pimichin and the Rio Negro,\r\nwhy, in the same soil, did we ford alternately rivulets of black and\r\nwhite water? Why did we find no river white near its springs, and\r\nblack in the lower part of its course? I know not whether the Rio\r\nNegro preserves its yellowish brown colour as far as its mouth,\r\nnotwithstanding the great quantity of white water it receives from the\r\nCassiquiare and the Rio Blanco.\r\n\r\nAlthough, on account of the abundance of rain, vegetation is more\r\nvigorous close to the equator than eight or ten degrees north or\r\nsouth, it cannot be affirmed, that the rivers with black waters rise\r\nprincipally in the most shady and thickest forests. On the contrary, a\r\ngreat number of the aguas negras come from the open savannahs that\r\nextend from the Meta beyond the Guaviare towards the Caqueta. In a\r\njourney which I made with Senor Montufar from the port of Guayaquil to\r\nthe Bodegas de Babaojo, at the period of the great inundations, I was\r\nstruck by the analogy of colour displayed by the vast savannahs of the\r\nInvernadero del Garzal and of the Lagartero, as well as by the Rio\r\nNegro and the Atabapo. These savannahs, partly inundated during three\r\nmonths, are composed of paspalum, eriochloa, and several species of\r\ncyperaceae. We sailed on waters that were from four to five feet deep;\r\ntheir temperature was by day from 33 to 34 degrees of the centigrade\r\nthermometer; they exhaled a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, to\r\nwhich no doubt some rotten plants of arum and heliconia, that swam on\r\nthe surface of the pools, contributed. The waters of the Lagartero\r\nwere of a golden yellow by transmitted, and coffee-brown by reflected\r\nlight. They are no doubt coloured by a carburet of hydrogen. An\r\nanalogous phenomenon is observed in the dunghill-waters prepared by\r\nour gardeners, and in the waters that issue from bogs. May we not also\r\nadmit, that it is a mixture of carbon and hydrogen, an extractive\r\nvegetable matter, that colours the black rivers, the Atabapo, the\r\nZama, the Mataveni, and the Guainia? The frequency of the equatorial\r\nrains contributes no doubt to this coloration by filtration through a\r\nthick mass of grasses. I suggest these ideas only in the form of a\r\ndoubt. The colouring principle seems to be in little abundance; for I\r\nobserved that the waters of the Guainia or Rio Negro, when subjected\r\nto ebullition, do not become brown like other fluids charged with\r\ncarburets of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIt is also very remarkable, that this phenomenon of black waters,\r\nwhich might be supposed to belong only to the low regions of the\r\ntorrid zone, is found also, though rarely, on the table-lands of the\r\nAndes. The town of Cuenca in the kingdom of Quito, is surrounded by\r\nthree small rivers, the Machangara, the Rio del Matadero, and the\r\nYanuncai; of which the two former are white, and the waters of the\r\nlast are black (aguas negras). These waters, like those of the\r\nAtabapo, are of a coffee-colour by reflection, and pale yellow by\r\ntransmission. They are very clear, and the inhabitants of Cuenca, who\r\ndrink them in preference to any other, attribute their colour to the\r\nsarsaparilla, which it is said grows abundantly on the banks of the\r\nRio Yanuncai.\r\n\r\nWe left the mouth of the Zama at five in the morning of the 23rd of\r\nApril. The river continued to be skirted on both sides by a thick\r\nforest. The mountains on the east seemed gradually to retire farther\r\nback. We passed first the mouth of the Rio Mataveni, and afterward an\r\nislet of a very singular form; a square granitic rock that rises in\r\nthe middle of the water. It is called by the missionaries El\r\nCastillito, or the Little Castle. Black bands seem to indicate, that\r\nthe highest swellings of the Orinoco do not rise at this place above\r\neight feet; and that the great swellings observed lower down are owing\r\nto the tributary streams which flow into it north of the raudales of\r\nAtures and Maypures. We passed the night on the right bank opposite\r\nthe mouth of the Rio Siucurivapu, near a rock called Aricagua. During\r\nthe night an innumerable quantity of bats issued from the clefts of\r\nthe rock, and hovered around our hammocks.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th a violent rain obliged us early to return to our boat. We\r\ndeparted at two o'clock, after having lost some books, which we could\r\nnot find in the darkness of the night, on the rock of Aricagua. The\r\nriver runs straight from south to north; its banks are low, and shaded\r\non both sides by thick forests. We passed the mouths of the Ucata, the\r\nArapa, and the Caranaveni. About four in the afternoon we landed at\r\nthe Conucos de Siquita, the Indian plantations of the mission of San\r\nFernando. The good people wished to detain us among them, but we\r\ncontinued to go up against the current, which ran at the rate of five\r\nfeet a second, according to a measurement I made by observing the time\r\nthat a floating body took to go down a given distance. We entered the\r\nmouth of the Guaviare on a dark night, passed the point where the Rio\r\nAtabapo joins the Guaviare, and arrived at the mission after midnight.\r\nWe were lodged as usual at the Convent, that is, in the house of the\r\nmissionary, who, though much surprised at our unexpected visit,\r\nnevertheless received us with the kindest hospitality.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIf, in the philosophical study of the structure of languages, the\r\nanalogy of a few roots acquires value only when they can be\r\ngeographically connected together, neither is the want of resemblance\r\nin roots any very strong proof against the common origin of nations.\r\nIn the different dialects of the Totonac language (that of one of the\r\nmost ancient tribes of Mexico) the sun and the moon have names which\r\ncustom has rendered entirely different. This difference is found among\r\nthe Caribs between the language of men and women; a phenomenon that\r\nprobably arises from the circumstance that, among prisoners, men were\r\noftener put to death than women. Females introduced by degrees words\r\nof a foreign language into the Caribbee; and, as the girls followed\r\nthe occupations of the women much more than the boys, a language was\r\nformed peculiar to the women. I shall record in this note the names of\r\nthe sun and moon in a great number of American and Asiatic idioms,\r\nagain reminding the reader of the uncertainty of all judgments founded\r\nmerely on the comparison of solitary words.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF NAMES OF THE SUN AND THE MOON.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 1 : LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 2 : NAME OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nCOLUMN 3 : NAME OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nIN THE NEW WORLD:\r\n\r\nEastern Esquimaux (Greenland) : Ajut, kaumat, sakanach : Anningat,\r\nkaumei, tatcok.\r\n\r\nWestern Esquimaux (Kadjak) : Tschingugak, madschak : Igaluk, tangeik.\r\n\r\nOjibbeway : Kissis : Debicot.\r\n\r\nDelaware : Natatane : Keyshocof.\r\n\r\nNootka : Opulszthl : Omulszthl.\r\n\r\nOtomi : Hindi : Zana.\r\n\r\nAztec or Mexican : Tonatiuh : Meztli.\r\n\r\nCora : Taica : Maitsaca.\r\n\r\nHuasteca : Aquicha : Aytz.\r\n\r\nMuysca : Zuhe (sua) : Chia.\r\n\r\nYaruro : ditto : Goppe.\r\n\r\nCaribbee and Tamanac : Veiou (hueiou) : Nouno (nonum).\r\n\r\nMaypure : Kie : Kejapi.\r\n\r\nLule : Inni : Allit.\r\n\r\nVilela : Olo : Copi.\r\n\r\nMoxo : Sachi : Cohe.\r\n\r\nChiquito : Suus : Copi.\r\n\r\nGuarani : Quarasi : Jasi.\r\n\r\nTupi (Brasil) : Coaracy : Iacy.\r\n\r\nPeruvian (Quichua) : Inti : Quilla.\r\n\r\nAraucan (Chili) : Antu : Cuyen.\r\n\r\nIN THE OLD WORLD:\r\n\r\nMongol : Nara (naran) : Sara (saran).\r\n\r\nMantchou : Choun : Bia.\r\n\r\nTschaghatai : Koun : Ay.\r\n\r\nOssete (of Caucasus) : Khourr : Mai.\r\n\r\nTibetan : Niyma : Rdjawa.\r\n\r\nChinese : Jy : Yue.\r\n\r\nJapanese : Fi : Tsouki.\r\n\r\nSanscrit : Surya, aryama, mitra, aditya, arka, hamsa : Tschandra,\r\ntschandrama, soma, masi.\r\n\r\nPersian : Chor, chorschid, afitab : Mah.\r\n\r\nZend : Houere.\r\n\r\nPehlvi : Schemschia, zabzoba, kokma : Kokma.\r\n\r\nPhoenician : Schemesih.\r\n\r\nHebrew : Schemesch : Yarea.\r\n\r\nAramean or Chaldean : Schimscha : Yarha.\r\n\r\nSyrian : Schemscho : Yarho.\r\n\r\nArabic : Schams : Kamar.\r\n\r\nEthiopian : Tzabay : Warha.\r\n\r\nThe American words are written according to the Spanish orthography. I\r\nwould not change the orthography of the Nootka word onulszth, taken\r\nfrom Cook's Voyages, to show how much Volney's idea of introducing an\r\nuniform notation of sounds is worthy of attention, if not applied to\r\nthe languages of the East written without vowels. In onulszth there\r\nare four signs for one single consonant. We have already seen that\r\nAmerican nations, speaking languages of a very different structure,\r\ncall the sun by the same name; that the moon is sometimes called\r\nsleeping sun, sun of night, light of night; and that sometimes the two\r\norbs have the same denomination. These examples are taken from the\r\nGuarany, the Omagua, Shawanese, Miami, Maco, and Ojibbeway idioms.\r\nThus in the Old World, the sun and moon are denoted in Arabic by\r\nniryn, the luminaries; thus, in Persian, the most common words, afitab\r\nand chorschid, are compounds. By the migration of tribes from Asia to\r\nAmerica, and from America to Asia, a certain number of roots have\r\npassed from one language into others; and these roots have been\r\ntransported, like the fragments of a shipwreck, far from the coast,\r\ninto the islands. (Sun, in New England, kone; in Tschagatai, koun; in\r\nYakout, kouini. Star, in Huastec, ot; in Mongol, oddon; in Aztec,\r\ncitlal, citl; in Persian, sitareh. House, in Aztec, calli; in Wogoul,\r\nkualla or kolla. Water, in Aztec, atel (itels, a river, in Vilela); in\r\nMongol, Tscheremiss, and Tschouvass, atl, atelch, etel, or idel.\r\nStone, in Caribbee, tebou; in the Lesgian of Caucasus, teb; in Aztec,\r\ntepetl; in Turkish, tepe. Food, in Quichua, micunnan; in Malay,\r\nmacannon. Boat, in Haitian, canoa; in Ayno, cahani; in Greenlandish,\r\nkayak; in Turkish, kayik; in Samoyiede, kayouk; in the Germanic\r\ntongues, kahn.) But we must distinguish from these foreign elements\r\nwhat belongs fundamentally to the American idioms themselves. Such is\r\nthe effect of time, and communication among nations, that the mixture\r\nwith an heterogenous language has not only an influence upon roots,\r\nbut most frequently ends by modifying and denaturalizing grammatical\r\nforms. \"When a language resists a regular analysis,\" observes William\r\nvon Humboldt, in his considerations on the Mexican, Cora, Totonac, and\r\nTarahumar tongues, \"we may suspect some mixture, some foreign\r\ninfluence; for the faculties of man, which are, as we may say,\r\nreflected in the structure of languages, and in their grammatical\r\nforms, act constantly in a regular and uniform manner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.22.\r\n\r\nSAN FERNANDO DE ATABAPO.\r\nSAN BALTHASAR.\r\nTHE RIVERS TEMI AND TUAMINI.\r\nJAVITA.\r\nPORTAGE FROM THE TUAMINI TO THE RIO NEGRO.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, we had left, almost unperceived, the waters of the\r\nOrinoco; and at sunrise found ourselves as if transported to a new\r\ncountry, on the banks of a river the name of which we had scarcely\r\never heard pronounced, and which was to conduct us, by the portage of\r\nPimichin, to the Rio Negro, on the frontiers of Brazil. \"You will go\r\nup,\" said the president of the missions, who resides at San Fernando,\r\n\"first the Atabapo, then the Temi, and finally, the Tuamini. When the\r\nforce of the current of black waters hinders you from advancing, you\r\nwill be conducted out of the bed of the river through forests, which\r\nyou will find inundated. Two monks only are settled in those desert\r\nplaces, between the Orinoco and the Rio Negro; but at Javita you will\r\nbe furnished with the means of having your canoe drawn over land in\r\nthe course of four days to Cano Pimichin. If it be not broken to\r\npieces you will descend the Rio Negro without any obstacle (from\r\nnorth-west to south-east) as far as the little fort of San Carlos; you\r\nwill go up the Cassiquiare (from south to north), and then return to\r\nSan Fernando in a month, descending the Upper Orinoco from east to\r\nwest.\" Such was the plan traced for our passage, and we carried it\r\ninto effect without danger, though not without some suffering, in the\r\nspace of thirty-three days. The Orinoco runs from its source, or at\r\nleast from Esmeralda, as far as San Fernando de Atabapo, from east to\r\nwest; from San Fernando, (where the junction of the Guaviare and the\r\nAtabapo takes place,) as far as the mouth of the Rio Apure, it flows\r\nfrom south to north, forming the Great Cataracts; and from the mouth\r\nof the Apure as far as Angostura and the coast of the Atlantic its\r\ndirection is from west to east. In the first part of its course, where\r\nthe river flows from east to west, it forms that celebrated\r\nbifurcation so often disputed by geographers, of which I was the first\r\nenabled to determine the situation by astronomical observations. One\r\narm of the Orinoco, (the Cassiquiare,) running from north to south,\r\nfalls into the Guainia, or Rio Negro, which, in its turn, joins the\r\nMaranon, or river Amazon. The most natural way, therefore, to go from\r\nAngostura to Grand Para, would be to ascend the Orinoco as far as\r\nEsmeralda, and then to go down the Cassiquiare, the Rio Negro, and the\r\nAmazon; but, as the Rio Negro in the upper part of its course\r\napproaches very near the sources of some rivers that fall into the\r\nOrinoco near San Fernando de Atabapo (where the Orinoco abruptly\r\nchanges its direction from east to west to take that from south to\r\nnorth), the passage up that part of the river between San Fernando and\r\nEsmeralda, in order to reach the Rio Negro, may be avoided. Leaving\r\nthe Orinoco near the mission of San Fernando, the traveller proceeds\r\nup the little black rivers (the Atabapo, the Temi, and the Tuamini),\r\nand the boats are carried across an isthmus six thousand toises broad,\r\nto the banks of a stream (the Cano Pimichin) which flows into the Rio\r\nNegro. This was the course which we took.\r\n\r\nThe road from San Carlos to San Fernando de Atabapo is far more\r\ndisagreeable, and is half as long again by the Cassiquiare as by\r\nJavita and the Cano Pimichin. In this region I determined, by means of\r\na chronometer by Berthoud, and by the meridional heights of stars, the\r\nsituation of San Balthasar de Atabapo, Javita, San Carlos del Rio\r\nNegro, the rock Culimacavi, and Esmeralda. When no roads exist save\r\ntortuous and intertwining rivers, when little villages are hidden amid\r\nthick forests, and when, in a country entirely flat, no mountain, no\r\nelevated object is visible from two points at once, it is only in the\r\nsky that we can read where we are upon the earth.\r\n\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo stands near the confluence of three great\r\nrivers; the Orinoco, the Guaviare, and the Atabapo. Its situation is\r\nsimilar to that of Saint Louis or of New Madrid, at the junction of\r\nthe Mississippi with the Missouri and the Ohio. In proportion as the\r\nactivity of commerce increases in these countries traversed by immense\r\nrivers, the towns situated at their confluence will necessarily become\r\nbustling ports, depots of merchandise, and centre points of\r\ncivilization. Father Gumilla confesses, that in his time no person had\r\nany knowledge of the course of the Orinoco above the mouth of the\r\nGuaviare.\r\n\r\nD'Anville, in the first edition of his great map of South America,\r\nlaid down the Rio Negro as an arm of the Orinoco, that branched off\r\nfrom the principal body of the river between the mouths of the Meta\r\nand the Vichada, near the cataract of Atures. That great geographer\r\nwas entirely ignorant of the existence of the Cassiquiare and the\r\nAtabapo; and he makes the Orinoco or Rio Paragua, the Japura, and the\r\nPutumayo, take their rise from three branchings of the Caqueta. The\r\nexpedition of the boundaries, commanded by Iturriaga and Solano,\r\ncorrected these errors. Solano, who was the geographical engineer of\r\nthis expedition, advanced in 1756 as far as the mouth of the Guaviare,\r\nafter having passed the Great Cataracts. He found that, to continue to\r\ngo up the Orinoco, he must direct his course towards the east; and\r\nthat the river received, at the point of its great inflection, in\r\nlatitude 4 degrees 4 minutes, the waters of the Guaviare, which two\r\nmiles higher had received those of the Atabapo. Interested in\r\napproaching the Portuguese possessions as near as possible, Solano\r\nresolved to proceed onward to the south. At the confluence of the\r\nAtabapo and the Guaviare he found an Indian settlement of the warlike\r\nnation of the Guaypunaves. He gained their favour by presents, and\r\nwith their aid founded the mission of San Fernando, to which he gave\r\nthe appellation of villa, or town.\r\n\r\nTo make known the political importance of this Mission, we must\r\nrecollect what was at that period the balance of power between the\r\npetty Indian tribes of Guiana. The banks of the Lower Orinoco had been\r\nlong ensanguined by the obstinate struggle between two powerful\r\nnations, the Cabres and the Caribs. The latter, whose principal abode\r\nsince the close of the seventeenth century has been between the\r\nsources of the Carony, the Essequibo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Parima,\r\nonce not only held sway as far as the Great Cataracts, but made\r\nincursions also into the Upper Orinoco, employing portages between the\r\nParuspa* (* The Rio Paruspa falls into the Rio Paragua, and the latter\r\ninto the Rio Carony, which is one of the tributary streams of the\r\nLower Orinoco. There is also an ancient portage of the Caribs between\r\nthe Paruspa and the Rio Chavaro, which flows into the Rio Caura above\r\nthe mouth of the Erevato. In going up the Erevato you reach the\r\nsavannahs that are traversed by the Rio Manipiare above the tributary\r\nstreams of the Ventuari. The Caribs in their distant excursions\r\nsometimes passed from the Rio Caura to the Ventuari, thence to the\r\nPadamo, and then by the Upper Orinoco to the Atacavi, which, westward\r\nof Manuteso, takes the name of the Atabapo.) and the Caura, the\r\nErevato and the Ventuari, the Conorichite and the Atacavi. None knew\r\nbetter than the Caribs the intertwinings of the rivers, the proximity\r\nof the tributary streams, and the roads by which distances might be\r\ndiminished. The Caribs had vanquished and almost exterminated the\r\nCabres. Having made themselves masters of the Lower Orinoco, they met\r\nwith resistance from the Guaypunaves, who had founded their dominion\r\non the Upper Orinoco; and who, together with the Cabres, the\r\nManitivitanos, and the Parenis, are the greatest cannibals of these\r\ncountries. They originally inhabited the banks of the great river\r\nInirida, at its confluence with the Chamochiquini, and the hilly\r\ncountry of Mabicore. About the year 1744, their chief, or as the\r\nnatives call him, their king (apoto), was named Macapu. He was a man\r\nno less distinguished by his intelligence than his valour; had led a\r\npart of the nation to the banks of the Atabapo; and when the Jesuit\r\nRoman made his memorable expedition from the Orinoco to the Rio Negro,\r\nMacapu suffered that missionary to take with him some families of the\r\nGuaypunaves to settle them at Uruana, and near the cataract of\r\nMaypures. This people are connected by their language with the great\r\nbranch of the Maypure nations. They are more industrious, we might\r\nalso say more civilized, than the other nations of the Upper Orinoco.\r\nThe missionaries relate, that the Guaypunaves, at the time of their\r\nsway in those countries, were generally clothed, and had considerable\r\nvillages. After the death of Macapu, the command devolved on another\r\nwarrior, Cuseru, called by the Spaniards El capitan Cusero. He\r\nestablished lines of defence on the banks of the Inirida, with a kind\r\nof little fort, constructed of earth and timber. The piles were more\r\nthan sixteen feet high, and surrounded both the house of the apoto and\r\na magazine of bows and arrows. These structures, remarkable in a\r\ncountry in other respects so wild, have been described by Father\r\nForneri.\r\n\r\nThe Marepizanas and the Manitivitanos were the preponderant nations on\r\nthe banks of the Rio Negro. The former had for its chiefs, about the\r\nyear 1750, two warriors called Imu and Cajamu. The king of the\r\nManitivitanos was Cocuy, famous for his cruelty. The chiefs of the\r\nGuaypunaves and the Manitivitanos fought with small bodies of two or\r\nthree hundred men; but in their protracted struggles they destroyed\r\nthe missions, in some of which the poor monks had only fifteen or\r\ntwenty Spanish soldiers at their disposal. When the expedition of\r\nIturriaga and Solano arrived at the Orinoco, the missions had no\r\nlonger to fear the incursions of the Caribs. Cuseru, the chief of the\r\nGuaypunaves, had fixed his dwelling behind the granitic mountains of\r\nSipapo. He was the friend of the Jesuits; but other nations of the\r\nUpper Orinoco and the Rio Negro, led by Imu, Cajamu, and Cocuy,\r\npenetrated from time to time to the north of the Great Cataracts. They\r\nhad other motives for fighting than that of hatred; they hunted men,\r\nas was formerly the custom of the Caribs, and is still the practice in\r\nAfrica. Sometimes they furnished slaves (poitos) to the Dutch (in\r\ntheir language, Paranaquiri--inhabitants of the sea); sometimes they\r\nsold them to the Portuguese (Iaranavi--sons of musicians).* (* The\r\nsavage tribes designate every commercial nation of Europe by surnames,\r\nthe origin of which appears altogether accidental. The Spaniards were\r\ncalled clothed men, Pongheme or Uavemi, by way of distinction.) In\r\nAmerica, as in Africa, the cupidity of the Europeans has produced the\r\nsame evils, by exciting the natives to make war, in order to procure\r\nslaves. Everywhere the contact of nations, widely different from each\r\nother in the scale of civilization, leads to the abuse of physical\r\nstrength, and of intellectual preponderance. The Phoenicians and\r\nCarthaginians formerly sought slaves in Europe. Europe now presses in\r\nher turn both on the countries whence she gathered the first germs of\r\nscience, and on those where she now almost involuntarily spreads them\r\nby carrying thither the produce of her industry.\r\n\r\nI have faithfully recorded what I could collect on the state of these\r\ncountries, where the vanquished nations have become gradually extinct,\r\nleaving no other signs of their existence than a few words of their\r\nlanguage, mixed with that of the conquerors. In the north, beyond the\r\ncataracts, the preponderant nations were at first the Caribs and the\r\nCabres; towards the south, on the Upper Orinoco, the Guaypunaves; and\r\non the Rio Negro, the Marepizanos and the Manitivitanos. The long\r\nresistance which the Cabres, united under a valiant chief, had made to\r\nthe Caribs, became fatal to the latter subsequently to the year 1720.\r\nThey at first vanquished their enemies near the mouth of the Rio\r\nCaura; and a great number of Caribs perished in a precipitate flight,\r\nbetween the rapids of Torno and the Isla del Infierno. The prisoners\r\nwere devoured; and, by one of those refinements of cunning and cruelty\r\nwhich are common to the savage nations of both North and South\r\nAmerica, the Cabres spared the life of one Carib, whom they forced to\r\nclimb up a tree to witness this barbarous spectacle, and carry back\r\nthe tidings to the vanquished. The triumph of Tep, the chief of the\r\nCabres, was but of short duration. The Caribs returned in such great\r\nnumbers that only a feeble remnant of the Cabres was left on the banks\r\nof the Cuchivero.\r\n\r\nCocuy and Cuseru were carrying on a war of extermination on the Upper\r\nOrinoco when Solano arrived at the mouth of the Guaviare. The former\r\nhad embraced the cause of the Portuguese; the latter was a friend of\r\nthe Jesuits, and gave them warning whenever the Manitivitanos were\r\nmarching against the christian establishments of Atures and Carichana.\r\nCuseru became a christian only a few days before his death; but in\r\nbattle he had for some time worn on his left hip a crucifix, given him\r\nby the missionaries, and which he believed rendered him invulnerable.\r\nWe were told an anecdote that paints the violence of his character. He\r\nhad married the daughter of an Indian chief of the Rio Temi. In a\r\nparoxysm of rage against his father-in-law, he declared to his wife\r\nthat he was going to fight against him. She reminded him of the\r\ncourage and singular strength of her father; when Cuseru, without\r\nuttering a single word, took a poisoned arrow, and plunged it into her\r\nbosom. The arrival of a small body of Spaniards in 1756, under the\r\norder of Solano, awakened suspicion in this chief of the Guaypunaves.\r\nHe was on the point of attempting a contest with them, when the\r\nJesuits made him sensible that it would be his interest to remain at\r\npeace with the Christians. Whilst dining at the table of the Spanish\r\ngeneral, Cuseru was allured by promises, and the prediction of the\r\napproaching fall of his enemies. From being a king he became the mayor\r\nof a village; and consented to settle with his people at the new\r\nmission of San Fernando de Atabapo. Such is most frequently the end of\r\nthose chiefs whom travellers and missionaries style Indian princes.\r\n\"In my mission,\" says the honest father Gili \"I had five reyecillos,\r\nor petty kings, those of the Tamanacs, the Avarigotes, the Parecas,\r\nthe Quaquas, and the Maypures. At church I placed them in file on the\r\nsame bench; but I took care to give the first place to Monaiti, king\r\nof the Tamanacs, because he had helped me to found the village; and he\r\nseemed quite proud of this precedency.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cuseru, the chief of the Guaypunaves, saw the Spanish troops pass\r\nthe cataracts, he advised Don Jose Solano to wait a whole year before\r\nhe formed a settlement on the Atabapo; predicting the misfortunes\r\nwhich were not slow to arrive. \"Let me labour with my people in\r\nclearing the ground,\" said Cuseru to the Jesuits; I will plant\r\ncassava, and you will find hereafter wherewith to feed all these men.\"\r\nSolano, impatient to advance, refused to listen to the counsel of the\r\nIndian chief, and the new inhabitants of San Fernando had to suffer\r\nall the evils of scarcity. Canoes were sent at a great expense to New\r\nGrenada, by the Meta and the Vichada, in search of flour. The\r\nprovision arrived too late, and many Spaniards and Indians perished of\r\nthose diseases which are produced in every climate by want and moral\r\ndejection.\r\n\r\nSome traces of cultivation are still found at San Fernando. Every\r\nIndian has a small plantation of cacao-trees, which produce abundantly\r\nin the fifth year; but they cease to bear fruit sooner than in the\r\nvalleys of Aragua. There are some savannahs and good pasturage round\r\nSan Fernando, but hardly seven or eight cows are to be found, the\r\nremains of a considerable herd which was brought into these countries\r\nat the expedition for settling the boundaries. The Indians are a\r\nlittle more civilized here than in the rest of the missions, and we\r\nfound to our surprise a blacksmith of the native race.\r\n\r\nIn the mission of San Fernando, a tree which gives a peculiar\r\nphysiognomy to the landscape, is the piritu or pirijao palm. Its\r\ntrunk, armed with thorns, is more than sixty feet high; its leaves are\r\npinnated, very thin, undulated, and frizzled towards the points. The\r\nfruits of this tree are very extraordinary; every cluster contains\r\nfrom fifty to eighty; they are yellow like apples, grow purple in\r\nproportion as they ripen, two or three inches thick, and generally,\r\nfrom abortion, without a kernel. Among the eighty or ninety species of\r\npalm-trees peculiar to the New Continent, which I have enumerated in\r\nthe Nova Genera Plantarum Aequinoctialum, there are none in which the\r\nsarcocarp is developed in a manner so extraordinary. The fruit of the\r\npirijao furnishes a farinaceous substance, as yellow as the yolk of an\r\negg, slightly saccharine, and extremely nutritious. It is eaten like\r\nplantains or potatoes, boiled or roasted in the ashes, and affords a\r\nwholesome and agreeable aliment. The Indians and the missionaries are\r\nunwearied in their praises of this noble palm-tree, which might be\r\ncalled the peach-palm. We found it cultivated in abundance at San\r\nFernando, San Balthasar, Santa Barbara, and wherever we advanced\r\ntowards the south or the east along the banks of the Atabapo and the\r\nUpper Orinoco. In those wild regions we are involuntarily reminded of\r\nthe assertion of Linnaeus, that the country of palm-trees was the\r\nfirst abode of our species, and that man is essentially palmivorous.*\r\n(* Homo HABITAT intra tropicos, vescitur palmis, lotophagus;\r\nHOSPITATUR extra tropicos sub novercante Cerere, carnivorus. Man\r\nDWELLS NATURALLY within the tropics, and lives on the fruits of the\r\npalm-tree; he EXISTS in other parts of the world, and there makes\r\nshift to feed on corn and flesh. Syst. Nat. volume 1 page 24.) On\r\nexamining the provision accumulated in the huts of the Indians, we\r\nperceive that their subsistence during several months of the year\r\ndepends as much on the farinaceous fruit of the pirijao, as on the\r\ncassava and plantain. The tree bears fruit but once a year, but to the\r\namount of three clusters, consequently from one hundred and fifty to\r\ntwo hundred fruits.\r\n\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo, San Carlos, and San Francisco Solano, are the\r\nmost considerable settlements among the missions of the Upper Orinoco.\r\nAt San Fernando, as well as in the neighbouring villages of San\r\nBalthasar and Javita, the abodes of the priests are neatly-built\r\nhouses, covered by lianas, and surrounded by gardens. The tall trunks\r\nof the pirijao palms were the most beautiful ornaments of these\r\nplantations. In our walks, the president of the mission gave us an\r\nanimated account of his incursions on the Rio Guaviare. He related to\r\nus how much these journeys, undertaken \"for the conquest of souls;\"\r\nare desired by the Indians of the missions. All, even women and old\r\nmen, take part in them. Under the pretext of recovering neophytes who\r\nhave deserted the village, children above eight or ten years of age\r\nare carried off, and distributed among the Indians of the missions as\r\nserfs, or poitos. According to the astronomical observations I took on\r\nthe banks of the Atabapo, and on the western declivity of the\r\nCordillera of the Andes, near the Paramo de la suma Paz, the distance\r\nis one hundred and seven leagues only from San Fernando to the first\r\nvillages of the provinces of Caguan and San Juan de los Llanos. I was\r\nassured also by some Indians, who dwelt formerly to the west of the\r\nisland of Amanaveni, beyond the confluence of the Rio Supavi, that\r\ngoing in a boat on the Guaviare (in the manner of the savages) beyond\r\nthe strait (angostura) and the principal cataract, they met, at three\r\ndays' distance, bearded and clothed men, who came in search of the\r\neggs of the terekay turtle. This meeting alarmed the Indians so much,\r\nthat they fled precipitately, redescending the Guaviare. It is\r\nprobable, that these bearded white men came from the villages of Aroma\r\nand San Martin, the Rio Guaviare being formed by the union of the\r\nrivers Ariari and Guayavero. We must not be surprised that the\r\nmissionaries of the Orinoco and the Atabapo little suspect how near\r\nthey live to the missionaries of Mocoa, Rio Fragua, and Caguan. In\r\nthese desert countries, the real distances can be known only by\r\nobservations of the longitude. It was in consequence of astronomical\r\ndata, and the information I gathered in the convents of Popayan and of\r\nPasto, to the west of the Cordillera of the Andes, that I formed an\r\naccurate idea of the respective situations of the christian\r\nsettlements on the Atabapo, the Guayavero, and the Caqueta.* (* The\r\nCaqueta bears, lower down, the name of the Yupura.)\r\n\r\nEverything changes on entering the Rio Atabapo; the constitution of\r\nthe atmosphere, the colour of the waters, and the form of the trees\r\nthat cover the shore. You no longer suffer during the day the torment\r\nof mosquitos; and the long-legged gnats (zancudos) become rare during\r\nthe night. Beyond the mission of San Fernando these nocturnal insects\r\ndisappear altogether. The water of the Orinoco is turbid, and loaded\r\nwith earthy matter; and in the coves, from the accumulation of dead\r\ncrocodiles and other putrescent substances, it diffuses a musky and\r\nfaint smell. We were sometimes obliged to strain this water through a\r\nlinen cloth before we drank it. The water of the Atabapo, on the\r\ncontrary, is pure, agreeable to the taste, without any trace of smell,\r\nbrownish by reflected, and of a pale yellow by transmitted light. The\r\npeople call it light, in opposition to the heavy and turbid waters of\r\nthe Orinoco. Its temperature is generally two degrees, and when you\r\napproach the mouth of the Rio Temi, three degrees, cooler than the\r\ntemperature of the Upper Orinoco. After having been compelled during a\r\nwhole year to drink water at 27 or 28 degrees, a lowering of a few\r\ndegrees in the temperature produces a very agreeable sensation. I\r\nthink this lowering of the temperature may be attributed to the river\r\nbeing less broad, and without the sandy beach, the heat of which, at\r\nthe Orinoco, is by day more than 50 degrees, and also to the thick\r\nshade of the forests which are traversed by the Atabapo, the Temi, the\r\nTuamini, and the Guainia, or Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe extreme purity of the black waters is proved by their limpidity,\r\ntheir transparency, and the clearness with which they reflect the\r\nimages and colours of surrounding objects. The smallest fish are\r\nvisible in them at a depth of twenty or thirty feet; and most commonly\r\nthe bottom of the river may be distinguished, which is not a yellowish\r\nor brownish mud, like the colour of the water, but a quartzose and\r\ngranitic sand of dazzling whiteness. Nothing can be compared to the\r\nbeauty of the banks of the Atabapo. Loaded with plants, among which\r\nrise the palms with feathery leaves; the banks are reflected in the\r\nwaters, and this reflex verdure seems to have the same vivid hue as\r\nthat which clothes the real vegetation. The surface of the fluid is\r\nhomogeneous, smooth, and destitute of that mixture of suspended sand\r\nand decomposed organic matter, which roughens and streaks the surface\r\nof less limpid rivers.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the Orinoco, several small rapids must be passed, but\r\nwithout any appearance of danger. Amid these raudalitos, according to\r\nthe opinion of the missionaries, the Rio Atabapo falls into the\r\nOrinoco. I am however disposed to think that the Atabapo falls into\r\nthe Guaviare. The Rio Guaviare, which is much wider than the Atabapo,\r\nhas white waters, and in the aspect of its banks, its fishing-birds,\r\nits fish, and the great crocodiles which live in it, resembles the\r\nOrinoco much more than that part of the Atabapo which comes from the\r\nEsmeralda. When a river springs from the junction of two other rivers,\r\nnearly alike in size, it is difficult to judge which of the two\r\nconfluent streams must be regarded as its source. The Indians of San\r\nFernando affirm that the Orinoco rises from two rivers, the Guaviare\r\nand the Rio Paragua. They give this latter name to the Upper Orinoco,\r\nfrom San Fernando and Santa Barbara to beyond the Esmeralda, and they\r\nsay that the Cassiquiare is not an arm of the Orinoco, but of the Rio\r\nParagua. It matters but little whether or not the name of Orinoco be\r\ngiven to the Rio Paragua, provided we trace the course of these rivers\r\nas it is in nature, and do not separate by a chain of mountains, (as\r\nwas done previously to my travels,) rivers that communicate together,\r\nand form one system. When we would give the name of a large river to\r\none of the two branches by which it is formed, it should be applied to\r\nthat branch which furnishes most water. Now, at the two seasons of the\r\nyear when I saw the Guaviare and the Upper Orinoco or Rio Paragua\r\n(between the Esmeralda and San Fernando), it appeared to me that the\r\nlatter was not so large as the Guaviare. Similar doubts have been\r\nentertained by geographers respecting the junction of the Upper\r\nMississippi with the Missouri and the Ohio, the junction of the\r\nMaranon with the Guallaga and the Ucayale, and the junction of the\r\nIndus with the Chunab (Hydaspes of Cashmere) and the Gurra, or\r\nSutlej.* (* The Hydaspes is properly a tributary stream of the Chunab\r\nor Acesines. The Sutlej or Hysudrus forms, together with the Beyah or\r\n*** Gurra. These are the beautiful regions of the *** celebrated from\r\nthe time of Alexander to the ***) To avoid embroiling farther a\r\nnomenclature of rivers so arbitrarily fixed, I will not propose new\r\ndenominations. I shall continue, with Father Caulin and the Spanish\r\ngeographers, to call the river Esmeralda the Orinoco, or Upper\r\nOrinoco; but I must observe that if the Orinoco, from San Fernando de\r\nAtabapo as far as the delta which it forms opposite the island of\r\nTrinidad, were regarded as the continuance of the Rio Guaviare, and if\r\nthat part of the Upper Orinoco between the Esmeralda and the mission\r\nof San Fernando were considered a tributary stream, the Orinoco would\r\npreserve, from the savannahs of San Juan de los Llanos and the eastern\r\ndeclivity of the Andes to its mouth, a more uniform and natural\r\ndirection, that from south-west to north-east.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Paragua, or that part of the Orinoco east of the mouth of the\r\nGuaviare, has clearer, more transparent, and purer water than the part\r\nof the Orinoco below San Fernando. The waters of the Guaviare, on the\r\ncontrary, are white and turbid; they have the same taste, according to\r\nthe Indians (whose organs of sense are extremely delicate and well\r\npractised), as the waters of the Orinoco near the Great Cataracts.\r\n\"Bring me the waters of three or four great rivers of these\r\ncountries,\" an old Indian of the mission of Javita said to us; \"on\r\ntasting each of them I will tell you, without fear of mistake, whence\r\nit was taken; whether it comes from a white or black river; the\r\nOrinoco or the Atabapo, the Paragua or the Guaviare.\" The great\r\ncrocodiles and porpoises (toninas) which are alike common in the Rio\r\nGuaviare and the Lower Orinoco, are entirely wanting, as we were told,\r\nin the Rio Paragua (or Upper Orinoco, between San Fernando and the\r\nEsmeralda). These are very remarkable differences in the nature of the\r\nwaters, and the distribution of animals. The Indians do not fail to\r\nmention them, when they would prove to travellers that the Upper\r\nOrinoco, to the east of San Fernando, is a distinct river which falls\r\ninto the Orinoco, and that the real origin of the latter must be\r\nsought in the sources of the Guaviare.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical observations made in the night of the 25th of April\r\ndid not give me the latitude with satisfactory precision. The latitude\r\nof the mission of San Fernando appeared to me to be 4 degrees 2\r\nminutes 48 seconds. In Father Caulin's map, founded on the\r\nobservations of Solano made in 1756, it is 4 degrees 1 minute. This\r\nagreement proves the justness of a result which, however, I could only\r\ndeduce from altitudes considerably distant from the meridian. A good\r\nobservation of the stars at Guapasoso gave me 4 degrees 2 minutes for\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo. I was able to fix the longitude with much\r\nmore precision in my way to the Rio Negro, and in returning from that\r\nriver. It is 70 degrees 30 minutes 46 seconds (or 4 degrees 0 minutes\r\nwest of the meridian of Cumana).\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of April we advanced only two or three leagues, and passed\r\nthe night on a rock near the Indian plantations or conucos of\r\nGuapasoso. The river losing itself by its inundations in the forests,\r\nand its real banks being unseen, the traveller can venture to land\r\nonly where a rock or a small table-land rises above the water. The\r\ngranite of those countries, owing to the position of the thin laminae\r\nof black mica, sometimes resembles graphic granite; but most\r\nfrequently (and this determines the age of its formation) it passes\r\ninto a real gneiss. Its beds, very regularly stratified, run from\r\nsouth-west to north-east, as in the Cordillera on the shore of\r\nCaracas. The dip of the granite-gneiss is 70 degrees north-west. It is\r\ntraversed by an infinite number of veins of quartz, which are\r\nsingularly transparent, and three or four, and sometimes fifteen\r\ninches thick. I found no cavity (druse), no crystallized substance,\r\nnot even rock-crystal; and no trace of pyrites, or any other metallic\r\nsubstance. I enter into these particulars on account of the chimerical\r\nideas that have been spread ever since the sixteenth century, after\r\nthe voyages of Berreo and Raleigh,* \"on the immense riches of the\r\ngreat and fine empire of Guiana.\" (* Raleigh's work bears the high\r\nsounding title of The Discovery of the large, rich, and beautiful\r\nEmpire of Guiana, London 1596. See also Raleghi admiranda Descriptio\r\nRegni Guianae, auri abundantissimi, Hondius Noribergae 1599.)\r\n\r\nThe river Atabapo presents throughout a peculiar aspect; you see\r\nnothing of its real banks formed by flat lands eight or ten feet high;\r\nthey are concealed by a row of palms, and small trees with slender\r\ntrunks, the roots of which are bathed by the waters. There are many\r\ncrocodiles from the point where you quit the Orinoco to the mission of\r\nSan Fernando, and their presence indicates that this part of the river\r\nbelongs to the Rio Guaviare and not to the Atabapo. In the real bed of\r\nthe latter river, above the mission of San Fernando, there are no\r\ncrocodiles: we find there some bavas, a great many fresh-water\r\ndolphins, but no manatees. We also seek in vain on these banks for the\r\nthick-nosed tapir, the araguato, or great howling monkey, the zamuro,\r\nor Vultur aura, and the crested pheasant, known by the name of\r\nguacharaca. Enormous water-snakes, in shape resembling the boa, are\r\nunfortunately very common, and are dangerous to Indians who bathe. We\r\nsaw them almost from the first day we embarked, swimming by the side\r\nof our canoe; they were at most twelve or fourteen feet long. The\r\njaguars of the banks of the Atabapo and the Temi are large and well\r\nfed; they are said, however, to be less daring than the jaguars of the\r\nOrinoco.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 27th was beautiful; dark clouds passed from time to\r\ntime over the zenith with extreme rapidity. Not a breath of wind was\r\nfelt in the lower strata of the atmosphere; the breeze was at the\r\nheight of a thousand toises. I dwell upon this peculiarity; for the\r\nmovement we saw was not produced by the counter-currents (from west to\r\neast) which are sometimes thought to be observed in the torrid zone on\r\nthe loftiest mountains of the Cordilleras; it was the effect of a real\r\nbreeze, an east wind. We left the conucos of Guapasoso at two o'clock;\r\nand continued to ascend the river toward the south, finding it (or\r\nrather that part of its bed which is free from trees) growing more and\r\nmore narrow. It began to rain toward sunrise. In these forests, which\r\nare less inhabited by animals than those of the Orinoco, we no longer\r\nheard the howlings of the monkeys. The dolphins, or toninas, sported\r\nby the side of our boat. According to the relation of Mr. Colebrooke,\r\nthe Delphinus gangeticus, which is the fresh-water porpoise of the Old\r\nWorld, in like manner accompanies the boats that go up towards\r\nBenares; but from Benares to the point where the Ganges receives the\r\nsalt waters is only two hundred leagues, while from the Atabapo to the\r\nmouth of the Orinoco is more than three hundred and twenty.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we passed the mouth of the little river Ipurichapano on the\r\neast, and afterwards the granitic rock, known by the name of Piedra\r\ndel Tigre. Between the fourth and fifth degrees of latitude, a little\r\nto the south of the mountains of Sipapo, we reach the southern\r\nextremity of that chain of cataracts, which I proposed, in a memoir\r\npublished in 1800, to call the Chain of Parima. At 4 degrees 20\r\nminutes it stretches from the right bank of the Orinoco toward the\r\neast and east-south-east. The whole of the land extending from the\r\nmountains of the Parima towards the river Amazon, which is traversed\r\nby the Atabapo, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro, is an immense\r\nplain, covered partly with forests, and partly with grass. Small rocks\r\nrise here and there like castles. We regretted that we had not stopped\r\nto rest near the Piedra del Tigre; for on going up the Atabapo we had\r\ngreat difficulty to find a spot of dry ground, open and spacious\r\nenough to light a fire, and place our instrument and our hammocks.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April, it rained hard after sunset, and we were afraid\r\nthat our collections would be damaged. The poor missionary had his fit\r\nof tertian fever, and besought us to re-embark immediately after\r\nmidnight. We passed at day-break the Piedra and the Raudalitos* (* The\r\nrock and little cascades.) of Guarinuma. The rock is on the east bank;\r\nit is a shelf of granite, covered with psora, cladonia, and other\r\nlichens. I could have fancied myself transported to the north of\r\nEurope, to the ridge of the mountains of gneiss and granite between\r\nFreiberg and Marienberg in Saxony. The cladonias appeared to me to be\r\nidentical with the Lichen rangiferinus, the L. pixidatus, and the L.\r\npolymorphus of Linnaeus. After having passed the rapids of Guarinuma,\r\nthe Indians showed us in the middle of the forest, on our right, the\r\nruins of the mission of Mendaxari, which has been long abandoned. On\r\nthe east bank of the river, near the little rock of Kemarumo, in the\r\nmidst of Indian plantations, a gigantic bombax* (* Bombax ceiba.)\r\nattracted our curiosity. We landed to measure it; the height was\r\nnearly one hundred and twenty feet, and the diameter between fourteen\r\nand fifteen. This enormous specimen of vegetation surprised us the\r\nmore, as we had till then seen on the banks of the Atabapo only small\r\ntrees with slender trunks, which from afar resembled young\r\ncherry-trees. The Indians assured that these small trees do not form a\r\nvery extensive group. They are checked in their growth by the\r\ninundations of the river; while the dry grounds near the Atabapo, the\r\nTemi, and the Tuamini, furnish excellent timber for building. These\r\nforests do not stretch indefinitely to the east and west, toward the\r\nCassiquiare and the Guaviare; they are bounded by the open savannahs\r\nof Manuteso, and the Rio Inirida. We found it difficult in the evening\r\nto stem the current, and we passed the night in a wood a little above\r\nMendaxari; which is another granitic rock traversed by a stratum of\r\nquartz. We found in it a group of fine crystals of black schorl.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, the air was cooler. We had no zancudos, but the sky was\r\nconstantly clouded, and without stars. I began to regret the Lower\r\nOrinoco. We still advanced but slowly from the force of the current,\r\nand we stopped a great part of the day to seek for plants. It was\r\nnight when we arrived at the mission of San Balthasar, or, as the\r\nmonks style it, the mission of la divina Pastora de Balthasar de\r\nAtabapo. We were lodged with a Catalonian missionary, a lively and\r\nagreeable man, who displayed in these wild countries the activity that\r\ncharacterises his nation. He had planted a garden, where the fig-tree\r\nof Europe was found in company with the persea, and the lemon-tree\r\nwith the mammee. The village was built with that regularity which, in\r\nthe north of Germany, and in protestant America, we find in the\r\nhamlets of the Moravian brethren; and the Indian plantations seemed\r\nbetter cultivated than elsewhere. Here we saw for the first time that\r\nwhite and fungous substance which I have made known by the name of\r\ndapicho and zapis.* (* These two words belong to the Poimisano and\r\nParagini tongues.) We immediately perceived that it was analogous to\r\nindia-rubber; but, as the Indians made us understand by signs, that it\r\nwas found underground, we were inclined to think, till we arrived at\r\nthe mission of Javita, that the dapicho was a fossil caoutchouc,\r\nthough different from the elastic bitumen of Derbyshire. A Pomisano\r\nIndian, seated by the fire in the hut of the missionary, was employed\r\nin reducing the dapicho into black caoutchouc. He had spitted several\r\nbits on a slender stick, and was roasting them like meat. The dapicho\r\nblackens in proportion as it grows soft, and becomes elastic. The\r\nresinous and aromatic smell which filled the hut, seemed to indicate\r\nthat this coloration is the effect of the decomposition of a carburet\r\nof hydrogen, and that the carbon appears in proportion as the hydrogen\r\nburns at a low heat. The Indian beat the softened and blackened mass\r\nwith a piece of brazil-wood, formed at one end like a club; he then\r\nkneaded the dapicho into balls of three or four inches in diameter,\r\nand let it cool. These balls exactly resemble the caoutchouc of the\r\nshops, but their surface remains in general slightly viscous. They are\r\nused at San Balthasar in the Indian game of tennis, which is\r\ncelebrated among the inhabitants of Uruana and Encaramada; they are\r\nalso cut into cylinders, to be used as corks, and are far preferable\r\nto those made of the bark of the cork-tree.\r\n\r\nThis use of caoutchouc appeared to us the more worthy notice, as we\r\nhad been often embarrassed by the want of European corks. The great\r\nutility of cork is fully understood in countries where trade has not\r\nsupplied this bark in plenty. Equinoctial America nowhere produces,\r\nnot even on the back of the Andes, an oak resembling the Quercus\r\nsuber; and neither the light wood of the bombax, the ochroma, and\r\nother malvaceous plants, nor the rhachis of maize, of which the\r\nnatives make use, can well supply the place of our corks. The\r\nmissionary showed us, before the Casa de los Solteros (the house where\r\nthe young unmarried men reside), a drum, which was a hollow cylinder\r\nof wood, two feet long and eighteen inches thick. This drum was beaten\r\nwith great masses of dapicho, which served as drumsticks; it had\r\nopenings which could be stopped by the hand at will, to vary the\r\nsounds, and was fixed on two light supports. Savage notions love noisy\r\nmusic; the drum and the botuto, or trumpet of baked earth, in which a\r\ntube of three or four feet long communicates with several barrels, are\r\nindispensable instruments among the Indians for their grand pieces of\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 30th of April was sufficiently fine for observing the\r\nmeridian heights of x of the Southern Cross, and the two large stars\r\nin the feet of the Centaur. I found the latitude of San Balthasar 3\r\ndegrees 14 minutes 23 seconds. Horary angles of the sun gave 70\r\ndegrees 14 minutes 21 seconds for the longitude by the chronometer.\r\nThe dip of the magnetic needle was 27.8 degrees (cent div). We left\r\nthe mission at a late hour in the morning, and continued to go up the\r\nAtabapo for five miles; then, instead of following that river to its\r\nsource in the east, where it bears the name of Atacavi, we entered the\r\nRio Temi. Before we reached its confluence, a granitic eminence on the\r\nwestern bank, near the mouth of the Guasacavi, fixed our attention: it\r\nis called Piedra de la Guahiba (Rock of the Guahiba woman), or the\r\nPiedra de la Madre (Mother's Rock.) We inquired the cause of so\r\nsingular a denomination. Father Zea could not satisfy our curiosity;\r\nbut some weeks after, another missionary, one of the predecessors of\r\nthat ecclesiastic, whom we found settled at San Fernando as president\r\nof the missions, related to us an event which excited in our minds the\r\nmost painful feelings. If, in these solitary scenes, man scarcely\r\nleaves behind him any trace of his existence, it is doubly humiliating\r\nfor a European to see perpetuated by so imperishable a monument of\r\nnature as a rock, the remembrance of the moral degradation of our\r\nspecies, and the contrast between the virtue of a savage, and the\r\nbarbarism of civilized man!\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the missionary of San Fernando had led his Indians to the\r\nbanks of the Rio Guaviare, on one of those hostile incursions which\r\nare prohibited alike by religion and the Spanish laws. They found in\r\nan Indian hut a Guahiba woman with her three children (two of whom\r\nwere still infants), occupied in preparing the flour of cassava.\r\nResistance was impossible; the father was gone to fish, and the mother\r\ntried in vain to flee with her children. Scarcely had she reached the\r\nsavannah when she was seized by the Indians of the mission, who hunt\r\nhuman beings, like the Whites and the Negroes in Africa. The mother\r\nand her children were bound, and dragged to the bank of the river. The\r\nmonk, seated in his boat, waited the issue of an expedition of which\r\nhe shared not the danger. Had the mother made too violent a resistance\r\nthe Indians would have killed her, for everything is permitted for the\r\nsake of the conquest of souls (la conquista espirituel), and it is\r\nparticularly desirable to capture children, who may be treated in the\r\nMission as poitos, or slaves of the Christians. The prisoners were\r\ncarried to San Fernando, in the hope that the mother would be unable\r\nto find her way back to her home by land. Separated from her other\r\nchildren who had accompanied their father on the day in which she had\r\nbeen carried off, the unhappy woman showed signs of the deepest\r\ndespair. She attempted to take back to her home the children who had\r\nbeen seized by the missionary; and she fled with them repeatedly from\r\nthe village of San Fernando. But the Indians never failed to recapture\r\nher; and the missionary, after having caused her to be mercilessly\r\nbeaten, took the cruel resolution of separating the mother from the\r\ntwo children who had been carried off with her. She was conveyed alone\r\nto the missions of the Rio Negro, going up the Atabapo. Slightly\r\nbound, she was seated at the bow of the boat, ignorant of the fate\r\nthat awaited her; but she judged by the direction of the sun, that she\r\nwas removing farther and farther from her hut and her native country.\r\nShe succeeded in breaking her bonds, threw herself into the water, and\r\nswam to the left bank of the Atabapo. The current carried her to a\r\nshelf of rock, which bears her name to this day. She landed and took\r\nshelter in the woods, but the president of the missions ordered the\r\nIndians to row to the shore, and follow the traces of the Guahiba. In\r\nthe evening she was brought back. Stretched upon the rock (la Piedra\r\nde la Madre) a cruel punishment was inflicted on her with those straps\r\nof manatee leather, which serve for whips in that country, and with\r\nwhich the alcaldes are always furnished. This unhappy woman, her hands\r\ntied behind her back with strong stalks of mavacure, was then dragged\r\nto the mission of Javita.\r\n\r\nShe was there thrown into one of the caravanserais, called las Casas\r\ndel Rey. It was the rainy season, and the night was profoundly dark.\r\nForests till then believed to be impenetrable separated the mission of\r\nJavita from that of San Fernando, which was twenty-five leagues\r\ndistant in a straight line. No other route is known than that by the\r\nrivers; no man ever attempted to go by land from one village to\r\nanother. But such difficulties could not deter a mother, separated\r\nfrom her children. The Guahiba was carelessly guarded in the\r\ncaravanserai. Her arms being wounded, the Indians of Javita had\r\nloosened her bonds, unknown to the missionary and the alcaldes. Having\r\nsucceeded by the help of her teeth in breaking them entirely, she\r\ndisappeared during the night; and at the fourth sunrise was seen at\r\nthe mission of San Fernando, hovering around the hut where her\r\nchildren were confined. \"What that woman performed,\" added the\r\nmissionary, who gave us this sad narrative, \"the most robust Indian\r\nwould not have ventured to undertake!\" She traversed the woods at a\r\nseason when the sky is constantly covered with clouds, and the sun\r\nduring whole days appears but for a few minutes. Did the course of the\r\nwaters direct her way? The inundations of the rivers forced her to go\r\nfar from the banks of the main stream, through the midst of woods\r\nwhere the movement of the water is almost imperceptible. How often\r\nmust she have been stopped by the thorny lianas, that form a network\r\naround the trunks they entwine! How often must she have swum across\r\nthe rivulets that run into the Atabapo! This unfortunate woman was\r\nasked how she had sustained herself during four days. She said that,\r\nexhausted with fatigue, she could find no other nourishment than those\r\ngreat black ants called vachacos, which climb the trees in long bands,\r\nto suspend on them their resinous nests. We pressed the missionary to\r\ntell us whether the Guahiba had peacefully enjoyed the happiness of\r\nremaining with her children; and if any repentance had followed this\r\nexcess of cruelty. He would not satisfy our curiosity; but at our\r\nreturn from the Rio Negro we learned that the Indian mother was again\r\nseparated from her children, and sent to one of the missions of the\r\nUpper Orinoco. There she died, refusing all kind of nourishment, as\r\nsavages frequently do in great calamities.\r\n\r\nSuch is the remembrance annexed to this fatal rock, the Piedra de la\r\nMadre. In this relation of my travels I feel no desire to dwell on\r\npictures of individual suffering--evils which are frequent wherever\r\nthere are masters and slaves, civilized Europeans living with people\r\nin a state of barbarism, and priests exercising the plenitude of\r\narbitrary power over men ignorant and without defence. In describing\r\nthe countries through which I passed, I generally confine myself to\r\npointing out what is imperfect, or fatal to humanity, in their civil\r\nor religious institutions. If I have dwelt longer on the Rock of the\r\nGuahiba, it was to record an affecting instance of maternal tenderness\r\nin a race of people so long calumniated; and because I thought some\r\nbenefit might accrue from publishing a fact, which I had from the\r\nmonks of San Francisco, and which proves how much the system of the\r\nmissions calls for the care of the legislator.\r\n\r\nAbove the mouth of the Guasucavi we entered the Rio Temi, the course\r\nof which is from south to north. Had we continued to ascend the\r\nAtabapo, we should have turned to east-south-east, going farther from\r\nthe banks of the Guainia or Rio Negro. The Temi is only eighty or\r\nninety toises broad, but in any other country than Guiana it would be\r\na considerable river. The country exhibits the uniform aspect of\r\nforests covering ground perfectly flat. The fine pirijao palm, with\r\nits fruit like peaches, and a new species of bache, or mauritia, its\r\ntrunk bristled with thorns, rise amid smaller trees, the vegetation of\r\nwhich appears to be retarded by the continuance of the inundations.\r\nThe Mauritia aculeata is called by the Indians juria or cauvaja; its\r\nleaves are in the form of a fan, and they bend towards the ground. At\r\nthe centre of every leaf, no doubt from the effect of some disease of\r\nthe parenchyma, concentric circles of alternate blue and yellow\r\nappear, the yellow prevailing towards the middle. We were singularly\r\nstruck by this appearance; the leaves, coloured like the peacock's\r\ntail, are supported by short and very thick trunks. The thorns are not\r\nslender and long like those of the corozo and other thorny palm-trees;\r\nbut on the contrary, very woody, short, and broad at the base, like\r\nthe thorns of the Hura crepitans. On the banks of the Atabapo and the\r\nTemi, this palm-tree is distributed in groups of twelve or fifteen\r\nstems, close together, and looking as if they rose from the same root.\r\nThese trees resemble in their appearance, form, and scarcity of\r\nleaves, the fan-palms and palmettos of the Old World. We remarked that\r\nsome plants of the juria were entirely destitute of fruit, and others\r\nexhibited a considerable quantity; this circumstance seems to indicate\r\na palm-tree of separate sexes.\r\n\r\nWherever the Rio Temi forms coves, the forest is inundated to the\r\nextent of more than half a square league. To avoid the sinuosities of\r\nthe river and shorten the passage, the navigation is here performed in\r\na very extraordinary manner. The Indians made us leave the bed of the\r\nriver; and we proceeded southward across the forest, through paths\r\n(sendas), that is, through open channels of four or five feet broad.\r\nThe depth of the water seldom exceeds half a fathom. These sendas are\r\nformed in the inundated forest like paths on dry ground. The Indians,\r\nin going from one mission to another, pass with their boats as much as\r\npossible by the same way; but the communications not being frequent,\r\nthe force of vegetation sometimes produces unexpected obstacles. An\r\nIndian, furnished with a machete (a great knife, the blade of which is\r\nfourteen inches long), stood at the head of our boat, employed\r\ncontinually in chopping off the branches that crossed each other from\r\nthe two sides of the channel. In the thickest part of the forest we\r\nwere astonished by an extraordinary noise. On beating the bushes, a\r\nshoal of toninas (fresh-water dolphins) four feet long, surrounded our\r\nboat. These animals had concealed themselves beneath the branches of a\r\nfromager, or Bombax ceiba. They fled across the forest, throwing out\r\nthose spouts of compressed air and water which have given them in\r\nevery language the name of blowers. How singular was this spectacle in\r\nan inland spot, three or four hundred leagues from the mouths of the\r\nOrinoco and the Amazon! I am aware that the pleuronectes (dabs) of the\r\nAtlantic go up the Loire as far as Orleans; but I am, nevertheless, of\r\nopinion that the dolphins of the Temi, like those of the Ganges, and\r\nlike the skate (raia) of the Orinoco, are of a species essentially\r\ndifferent from the dolphins and skates of the ocean. In the immense\r\nrivers of South America, and the great lakes of North America, nature\r\nseems to repeat several pelagic forms. The Nile has no porpoises:*\r\nthose of the sea go up the Delta no farther than Biana and Metonbis\r\ntowards Selamoun. (* Those dolphins that enter the mouth of the Nile,\r\ndid not escape the observation of the ancients. In a bust in syenite,\r\npreserved in the museum at Paris, the sculptor has represented them\r\nhalf concealed in the undulatory beard of the god of the river.)\r\n\r\nAt five in the evening we regained with some difficulty the bed of the\r\nriver. Our canoe remained fast for some minutes between two trunks of\r\ntrees; and it was no sooner disengaged than we reached a spot where\r\nseveral paths, or small channels, crossed each other, so that the\r\npilot was puzzled to distinguish the most open path. We navigated\r\nthrough a forest so thick that we could guide ourselves neither by the\r\nsun nor by the stars. We were again struck during this day by the want\r\nof arborescent ferns in that country; they diminish visibly from the\r\nsixth degree of north latitude, while the palm-trees augment\r\nprodigiously towards the equator. Fern-trees belong to a climate less\r\nhot, and a soil but little mountainous. It is only where there are\r\nmountains that these majestic plants descend towards the plains; they\r\nseem to avoid perfectly flat grounds, as those through which run the\r\nCassiquiare, the Temi, Inirida, and the Rio Negro. We passed in the\r\nnight near a rock, called the Piedra de Astor by the missionaries. The\r\nground from the mouth of the Guaviare constantly displays the same\r\ngeological formation. It is a vast granitic plain, in which from\r\nleague to league the rock pierces the soil, and forms, not hillocks,\r\nbut small masses, that resemble pillars or ruined buildings.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May the Indians chose to depart long before sunrise. We\r\nwere stirring before them, however, because I waited (though vainly)\r\nfor a star ready to pass the meridian. In those humid regions covered\r\nwith forests, the nights became more obscure in proportion as we drew\r\nnearer to the Rio Negro and the interior of Brazil. We remained in the\r\nbed of the river till daybreak, being afraid of losing ourselves among\r\nthe trees. At sunrise we again entered the inundated forest, to avoid\r\nthe force of the current. On reaching the junction of the Temi with\r\nanother little river, the Tuamini, the waters of which are equally\r\nblack, we proceeded along the latter to the south-west. This direction\r\nled us near the mission of Javita, which is founded on the banks of\r\nthe Tuamini; and at this christian settlement we were to find the aid\r\nnecessary for transporting our canoe by land to the Rio Negro. We did\r\nnot arrive at San Antonio de Javita till near eleven in the morning.\r\nAn accident, unimportant in itself, but which shows the excessive\r\ntimidity of the little sagoins detained us some time at the mouth of\r\nthe Tuamini. The noise of the blowers had frightened our monkeys, and\r\none of them fell into the water. Animals of this species, perhaps on\r\naccount of their extreme meagreness, swim badly; and consequently it\r\nwas saved with some difficulty.\r\n\r\nAt Javita we had the pleasure of finding a very intelligent and\r\nobliging monk, at whose mission we were forced to remain four or five\r\ndays, the time required for transporting our boat across the portage\r\nof Pimichin. This delay enabled us to visit the surrounding country,\r\nas also to relieve ourselves from an annoyance which we had suffered\r\nfor two days. We felt an extraordinary irritation on the joints of our\r\nfingers, and on the backs of our hands. The missionary told us it was\r\ncaused by the aradores,* (* Literally the ploughers.) which get under\r\nthe skin. We could distinguish with a lens nothing but streaks, or\r\nparallel and whitish furrows. It is the form of these furrows, that\r\nhas obtained for the insect the name of ploughman. A mulatto woman was\r\nsent for, who professed to be thoroughly acquainted with all the\r\nlittle insects that burrow in the human skin; the chego, the nuche,\r\nthe coya, and the arador; she was the curandera, or surgeon of the\r\nplace. She promised to extirpate, one by one, the insects which caused\r\nthis smarting irritation. Having heated at a lamp the point a little\r\nbit of hard wood, she dug with it into the furrows that marked the\r\nskin. After long examination, she announced with the pedantic gravity\r\npeculiar to the mulatto race, that an arador was found. I saw a little\r\nround bag, which I suspected to be the egg of an acarus. I was to find\r\nrelief when the mulatto woman had succeeded in taking out three or\r\nfour of these aradores. Having the skin of both hands filled with\r\nacari, I had not the patience to wait the end of an operation, which\r\nhad already lasted till late at night. The next day an Indian of\r\nJavita cured us radically, and with surprising promptitude. He brought\r\nus the branch of a shrub, called uzao, with small leaves like those of\r\ncassia, very coriaceous and glossy. He made a cold infusion of the\r\nbark of this shrub, which had a bluish colour, and the taste of\r\nliquorice. When beaten, it yields a great deal of froth. The\r\nirritation of the aradores ceased by using simple lotions of this\r\nuzao-water. We could not find this shrub in flower, or bearing fruit;\r\nit appears to belong to the family of the leguminous plants, the\r\nchemical properties of which are singularly varied. We dreaded so much\r\nthe sufferings to which we had been exposed, that we constantly kept\r\nsome branches of the uzao in our boat, till we reached San Carlos.\r\nThis shrub grows in abundance on the banks of the Pimichin. Why has no\r\nremedy been discovered for the irritation produced by the sting of the\r\nzancudos, as well as for that occasioned by the aradores or\r\nmicroscopic acari?\r\n\r\nIn 1755, before the expedition for fixing the boundaries, better known\r\nby the name of the expedition of Solano, the whole country between the\r\nmissions of Javita and San Balthasar was regarded as dependent on\r\nBrazil. The Portuguese had advanced from the Rio Negro, by the portage\r\nof the Cano Pimichin, as far as the banks of the Temi. An Indian chief\r\nof the name of Javita, celebrated for his courage and his spirit of\r\nenterprise, was the ally of the Portuguese. He pushed his hostile\r\nincursions from the Rio Jupura, or Caqueta, one of the great tributary\r\nstreams of the Amazon, by the rivers Uaupe and Xie, as far as the\r\nblack waters of the Temi and the Tuamini, a distance of more than a\r\nhundred leagues. He was furnished with letters patent, which\r\nauthorised him to bring the Indians from the forest, for the conquest\r\nof souls. He availed himself amply of this permission; but his\r\nincursions had an object which was not altogether spiritual, that of\r\nmaking slaves to sell to the Portuguese. When Solano, the second chief\r\nof the expedition of the boundaries, arrived at San Fernando de\r\nAtabapo, he had Javita seized, in one of his incursions to the banks\r\nof the Temi. He treated him with gentleness, and succeeded in gaining\r\nhim over to the interests of the Spanish government by promises that\r\nwere not fulfilled. The Portuguese, who had already formed some stable\r\nsettlements in these countries, were driven back as far as the lower\r\npart of the Rio Negro; and the mission of San Antonio, of which the\r\nmore usual name is Javita, so called after its Indian founder, was\r\nremoved farther north of the sources of the Tuamini, to the spot where\r\nit is now established. This captain, Javita, was still living, at an\r\nadvanced age, when we proceeded to the Rio Negro. He was an Indian of\r\ngreat vigour of mind and body. He spoke Spanish with facility, and\r\npreserved a certain influence over the neighbouring nations. As he\r\nattended us in all our herborizations, we obtained from his own mouth\r\ninformation so much the more useful, as the missionaries have great\r\nconfidence in his veracity. He assured us that in his youth he had\r\nseen almost all the Indian tribes that inhabit the vast regions\r\nbetween the Upper Orinoco, the Rio Negro, the Inirida, and the Jupura,\r\neat human flesh. The Daricavanas, the Puchirinavis, and the\r\nManitivitanos, appeared to him to be the greatest cannibals among\r\nthem. He believes that this abominable practice is with them the\r\neffect of a system of vengeance; they eat only enemies who are made\r\nprisoners in battle. The instances where, by a refinement of cruelty,\r\nthe Indian eats his nearest relations, his wife, or an unfaithful\r\nmistress, are extremely rare. The strange custom of the Scythians and\r\nMassagetes, the Capanaguas of the Rio Ucayale, and the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the West Indian Islands, of honouring the dead by\r\neating a part of their remains, is unknown on the banks of the\r\nOrinoco. In both continents this trait of manners belongs only to\r\nnations that hold in horror the flesh of a prisoner. The Indian of\r\nHayti (Saint Domingo) would think himself wanting in regard to the\r\nmemory of a relation, if he did not throw into his drink a small\r\nportion of the body of the deceased, after having dried it like one of\r\nthe mummies of the Guanches, and reduced it to powder. This gives us\r\njust occasion to repeat with an eastern poet, \"of all animals man is\r\nthe most fantastic in his manners, and the most disorderly in his\r\npropensities.\"\r\n\r\nThe climate of the mission of San Antonio de Javita is extremely\r\nrainy. When you have passed the latitude of three degrees north, and\r\napproach the equator, you have seldom an opportunity of observing the\r\nsun or the stars. It rains almost the whole year, and the sky is\r\nconstantly cloudy. As the breeze is not felt in these immense forests\r\nof Guiana, and the refluent polar currents do not penetrate them, the\r\ncolumn of air which reposes on this wooded zone is not renewed by\r\ndryer strata. It is saturated with vapours which are condensed into\r\nequatorial rains. The missionary assured us that it often rains here\r\nfour or five months without cessation.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of Javita is cooler than that of Maypures, but\r\nconsiderably hotter than that of the Guainia or Rio Negro. The\r\ncentigrade thermometer kept up in the day to twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven degrees; and in the night to twenty-one degrees.\r\n\r\nFrom the 30th of April to the 11th of May, I had not been able to see\r\nany star in the meridian so as to determine the latitude of places. I\r\nwatched whole nights in order to make use of the method of double\r\naltitudes; but all my efforts were useless. The fogs of the north of\r\nEurope are not more constant than those of the equatorial regions of\r\nGuiana. On the 4th of May, I saw the sun for some minutes; and found\r\nby the chronometer and the horary angles the longitude of Javita to be\r\n70 degrees 22 minutes, or 1 degree 15 minutes farther west than the\r\nlongitude of the junction of the Apure with the Orinoco. This result\r\nis interesting for laying down on our maps the unknown country lying\r\nbetween the Xie and the sources of the Issana, situated on the same\r\nmeridian with the mission of Javita.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Javita, whose number amounts to one hundred and sixty,\r\nnow belong for the most part to the nations of the Poimisanos, the\r\nEchinavis, and the Paraganis. They are employed in the construction of\r\nboats, formed of the trunks of sassafras, a large species of laurel,\r\nhollowed by means of fire and the hatchet. These trees are more than\r\none hundred feet high; the wood is yellow, resinous, almost\r\nincorruptible in water, and has a very agreeable smell. We saw them at\r\nSan Fernando, at Javita, and more particularly at Esmeralda, where\r\nmost of the canoes of the Orinoco are constructed, because the\r\nadjacent forests furnish the largest trunks of sassafras.\r\n\r\nThe forest between Javita and the Cano Pimichin, contains an immense\r\nquantity of gigantic trees, ocoteas, and laurels, the Amasonia\r\narborea,* (* This is a new species of the genus taligalea of Aublet.\r\nOn the same spot grow the Bignonia magnoliaefolia, B. jasminifolia,\r\nSolanum topiro, Justicia pectoralis, Faramea cymosa, Piper javitense,\r\nScleria hirtella, Echites javitensis, Lindsea javitensis, and that\r\ncurious plant of the family of the verbenaceae, which I have dedicated\r\nto the illustrious Leopold von Buch, in whose early labours I\r\nparticipated.) the Retiniphyllum secundiflorum, the curvana, the\r\njacio, the iacifate, of which the wood is red like the brazilletto,\r\nthe guamufate, with its fine leaves of calophyllum from seven to eight\r\ninches long, the Amyris carana, and the mani. All these trees (with\r\nthe exception of our new genus Retiniphyllum) were more than one\r\nhundred or one hundred and ten feet high. As their trunks throw out\r\nbranches only toward the summit, we had some trouble in procuring both\r\nleaves and flowers. The latter were frequently strewed upon the ground\r\nat the foot of the trees; but, the plants of different families being\r\ngrouped together in these forests, and every tree being covered with\r\nlianas, we could not, with any degree of confidence, rely on the\r\nauthority of the natives, when they assured us that a flower belonged\r\nto such or such a tree. Amid these riches of nature heborizations\r\ncaused us more chagrin than satisfaction. What we could gather\r\nappeared to us of little interest, compared to what we could not\r\nreach. It rained unceasingly during several months, and M. Bonpland\r\nlost the greater part of the specimens which he had been compelled to\r\ndry by artificial heat. Our Indians distinguished the leaves better\r\nthan the corollae or the fruit. Occupied in seeking timber for canoes,\r\nthey are inattentive to flowers. \"All those great trees bear neither\r\nflowers nor fruits,\" they repeated unceasingly. Like the botanists of\r\nantiquity, they denied what they had not taken the trouble to observe.\r\nThey were tired with our questions, and exhausted our patience in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned that the same chemical properties being\r\nsometimes found in the same organs of different families of plants,\r\nthese families supply each other's places in various climates. Several\r\nspecies of palms* furnish the inhabitants of equinoctial America and\r\nAfrica with the oil which we derive from the olive. (* In Africa, the\r\nelais or maba; in America the cocoa-tree. In the cocoa-tree it is the\r\nperisperm; and in the elais (as in the olive, and the oleineae in\r\ngeneral) it is the sarcocarp, or the pulp of the pericarp, that yields\r\noil. This difference, observed in the same family, appears to me very\r\nremarkable, though it is in no way contradictory to the results\r\nobtained by De Candolle in his ingenious researches on the chemical\r\nproperties of plants. If our Alfonsia oleifera belong to the genus\r\nElais (as Brown, with great reason believes), it follows, that in the\r\nsame genus the oil is found in the sarcocarp and in the perisperm.)\r\nWhat the coniferae are to the temperate zone, the terebinthaceae and\r\nthe guttiferae are to the torrid. In the forests of those burning\r\nclimates, (where there is neither pine, thuya, taxodium, nor even a\r\npodocarpus,) resins, balsams, and aromatic gums, are furnished by the\r\nmaronobea, the icica, and the amyris. The collecting of these gummy\r\nand resinous substances is a trade in the village of Javita. The most\r\ncelebrated resin bears the name of mani; and of this we saw masses of\r\nseveral hundred-weight, resembling colophony and mastic. The tree\r\ncalled mani by the Paraginis, which M. Bonpland believes to be the\r\nMoronobaea coccinea, furnishes but a small quantity of the substance\r\nemployed in the trade with Angostura. The greatest part comes from the\r\nmararo or caragna, which is an amyris. It is remarkable enough, that\r\nthe name mani, which Aublet heard among the Galibis* of Cayenne, was\r\nagain heard by us at Javita, three hundred leagues distant from French\r\nGuiana. (* The Galibis or Caribis (the r has been changed into l, as\r\noften happens) are of the great stock of the Carib nations. The\r\nproducts useful in commerce and in domestic life have received the\r\nsame denomination in every part of America which this warlike and\r\ncommercial people have overrun.) The moronobaea or symphonia of Javita\r\nyields a yellow resin; the caragna, a resin strongly odoriferous, and\r\nwhite as snow; the latter becomes yellow where it is adherent to the\r\ninternal part of old bark.\r\n\r\nWe went every day to see how our canoe advanced on the portages.\r\nTwenty-three Indians were employed in dragging it by land, placing\r\nbranches of trees to serve as rollers. In this manner a small boat\r\nproceeds in a day or a day and a half, from the waters of the Tuamini\r\nto those of the Cano Pimichin, which flow into the Rio Negro. Our\r\ncanoe being very large, and having to pass the cataracts a second\r\ntime, it was necessary to avoid with particular care any friction on\r\nthe bottom; consequently the passage occupied more than four days. It\r\nis only since 1795 that a road has been traced through the forest. By\r\nsubstituting a canal for this portage, as I proposed to the ministry\r\nof king Charles IV, the communication between the Rio Negro and\r\nAngostura, between the Spanish Orinoco and the Portuguese possessions\r\non the Amazon, would be singularly facilitated.\r\n\r\nIn this forest we at length obtained precise information respecting\r\nthe pretended fossil caoutchouc, called dapicho by the Indians. The\r\nold chief Javita led us to the brink of a rivulet which runs into the\r\nTuamini; and showed us that, after digging two or three feet deep, in\r\na marshy soil, this substance was found between the roots of two trees\r\nknown by the name of the jacio and the curvana. The first is the hevea\r\nof Aublet, or siphonia of the modern botanists, known to furnish the\r\ncaoutchouc of commerce in Cayenne and Grand Para; the second has\r\npinnate leaves, and its juice is milky, but very thin, and almost\r\ndestitute of viscosity. The dapicho appears to be the result of an\r\nextravasation of the sap from the roots. This extravasation takes\r\nplace more especially when the trees have attained a great age, and\r\nthe interior of the trunk begins to decay. The bark and alburnum\r\ncrack; and thus is effected naturally, what the art of man performs\r\nfor the purpose of collecting the milky juices of the hevea, the\r\ncastilloa, and the caoutchouc fig-tree. Aublet relates, that the\r\nGalibis and the Garipons of Cayenne begin by making a deep incision at\r\nthe foot of the trunk, so as to penetrate into the wood; soon after\r\nthey join with this horizontal notch others both perpendicular and\r\noblique, reaching from the top of the trunk nearly to the roots. All\r\nthese incisions conduct the milky juice towards one point, where the\r\nvase of clay is placed, in which the caoutchouc is to be deposited. We\r\nsaw the Indians of Carichana operate nearly in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIf, as I suppose, the accumulation and overflowing of the milk in the\r\njacio and the curvana be a pathological phenomenon, it must sometimes\r\ntake place at the extremity of the longest roots, for we found masses\r\nof dapicho two feet in diameter and four inches thick, eight feet\r\ndistant from the trunks. Sometimes the Indians dig in vain at the foot\r\nof dead trees; at other times the dapicho is found beneath the hevea\r\nor jacio still green. The substance is white, corky, fragile, and\r\nresembles by its laminated structure and undulating edge, the Boletus\r\nignarius. The dapicho perhaps takes a long time to form; it is\r\nprobably a juice thickened by a particular disposition of the\r\nvegetable organs, diffused and coagulated in a humid soil secluded\r\nfrom the contact of light; it is caoutchouc in a particular state, I\r\nmay almost say an etiolated caoutchouc. The humidity of the soil seems\r\nto account for the undulating form of the edges of the dapicho, and\r\nits division into layers.\r\n\r\nI often observed in Peru, that on pouring slowly the milky juice of\r\nthe hevea, or the sap of the carica, into a large quantity of water,\r\nthe coagulum forms undulating outlines. The dapicho is certainly not\r\npeculiar to the forest that extends from Javita to Pimichin, although\r\nthat is the only spot where it has hitherto been found. I have no\r\ndoubt, that on digging in French Guiana beneath the roots and the old\r\ntrunks of the hevea, those enormous masses of corky caoutchouc,* which\r\nI have just described, would from time to time be found. (* Thus, at\r\nfive or six inches depth, between the roots of the Hymenea courbaril,\r\nmasses of the resin anime (erroneously called copal) are discovered,\r\nand are sometimes mistaken for amber in inland places. This phenomenon\r\nseems to throw some light on the origin of those large masses of amber\r\nwhich are picked up from time to time on the coast of Prussia.) As it\r\nis observed in Europe, that at the fall of the leaf the sap is\r\nconveyed towards the root, it would be curious to examine whether,\r\nwithin the tropics, the milky juices of the urticeae, the\r\neuphorbiaceae, and the apocyneae, descend also at certain seasons.\r\nNotwithstanding a great equality of temperature, the trees of the\r\ntorrid zone follow a cycle of vegetation; they undergo changes\r\nperiodically returning. The existence of the dapicho is more\r\ninteresting to physiology than to vegetable chemistry. A\r\nyellowish-white caoutchouc is now to be found in the shops, which may\r\nbe easily distinguished from the dapicho, because it is neither dry\r\nlike cork, nor friable, but extremely elastic, glossy, and soapy. I\r\nlately saw considerable quantities of it in London. This caoutchouc,\r\nwhite, and greasy to the touch, is prepared in the East Indies. It\r\nexhales that animal and fetid smell which I have attributed in another\r\nplace to a mixture of caseum and albumen.* (* The pellicles deposited\r\nby the milk of hevea, in contact with the atmospheric oxygen, become\r\nbrown on exposure to the sun. If the dapicho grow black as it is\r\nsoftened before the fire, it is owing to a slight combustion, to a\r\nchange in the proportion of its elements. I am surprised that some\r\nchemists consider the black caoutchouc of commerce, as being mixed\r\nwith soot, blackened by the smoke to which it has been exposed.) When\r\nwe reflect on the immense variety of plants in the equinoctial regions\r\nthat are capable of furnishing caoutchouc, it is to be regretted that\r\nthis substance, so eminently useful, is not found among us at a lower\r\nprice. Without cultivating trees with a milky sap, a sufficient\r\nquantity of caoutchouc might be collected in the missions of the\r\nOrinoco alone for the consumption of civilized Europe.* (* We saw in\r\nGuiana, besides the jacio and the curvana, two other trees that yield\r\ncaoutchouc in abundance; on the banks of the Atabapo the guamaqui with\r\njatropha leaves, and at Maypures the cime.) In the kingdom of New\r\nGrenada some successful attempts have been made to make boots and\r\nshoes of this substance without a seam. Among the American nations,\r\nthe Omaguas of the Amazon best understand how to manufacture\r\ncaoutchouc.\r\n\r\nFour days had passed, and our canoe had not yet arrived at the\r\nlanding-place of the Rio Pimichin. \"You want for nothing in my\r\nmission,\" said Father Cereso; \"you have plantains and fish; at night\r\nyou are not stung by mosquitos; and the longer you stay, the better\r\nchance you will have of seeing the stars of my country. If your boat\r\nbe destroyed in the portage, we will give you another; and I shall\r\nhave had the satisfaction of passing some weeks con gente blanca y de\r\nrazon.\" (\"With white and rational people.\" European self-love usually\r\nopposes the gente de razon to the gente parda, or coloured people.)\r\nNotwithstanding our impatience, we listened with interest to the\r\ninformation given us by the worthy missionary. It confirmed all we had\r\nalready heard of the moral state of the natives of those countries.\r\nThey live, distributed in hordes of forty or fifty, under a family\r\ngovernment; and they recognise a common chief (apoto, sibierene) only\r\nat times when they make war against their neighbours. The mistrust of\r\nthese hordes towards one another is increased by the circumstance that\r\nthose who live in the nearest neighbourhood speak languages altogether\r\ndifferent. In the open plains, in the countries with savannahs, the\r\ntribes are fond of choosing their habitations from an affinity of\r\norigin, and a resemblance of manners and idioms. On the table-land of\r\nTartary, as in North America, great families of nations have been\r\nseen, formed into several columns, extending their migrations across\r\ncountries thinly-wooded, and easily traversed. Such were the journeys\r\nof the Toltec and Aztec race in the high plains of Mexico, from the\r\nsixth to the eleventh century of our era; such probably was also the\r\nmovement of nations by which the petty tribes of Canada were grouped\r\ntogether. As the immense country between the equator and the eighth\r\ndegree of north latitude forms one continuous forest, the hordes were\r\nthere dispersed by following the branchings of the rivers, and the\r\nnature of the land compelled them to become more or less\r\nagriculturists. Such is the labyrinth of these rivers, that families\r\nsettled themselves without knowing what race of men lived nearest the\r\nspot. In Spanish Guiana a mountain, or a forest half a league broad,\r\nsometimes separates hordes who could not meet in less than two days by\r\nnavigating rivers. In open countries, or in a state of advanced\r\ncivilization, communication by rivers contributes powerfully to\r\ngeneralize languages, manners, and political institutions; but in the\r\nimpenetrable forests of the torrid zone, as in the first rude\r\ncondition of our species, rivers increase the dismemberment of great\r\nnations, favour the transition of dialects into languages that appear\r\nto us radically distinct, and keep up national hatred and mistrust.\r\nBetween the banks of the Caura and the Padamo everything bears the\r\nstamp of disunion and weakness. Men avoid, because they do not\r\nunderstand, each other; they mutually hate, because they mutually\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine attentively this wild part of America, we fancy\r\nourselves transported to those primitive times when the earth was\r\npeopled by degrees, and we seem to be present at the birth of human\r\nsocieties. In the old world we see that pastoral life has prepared the\r\nhunting nations for agriculture. In the New World we seek in vain\r\nthese progressive developments of civilization, these intervals of\r\nrepose, these stages in the life of nations. The luxury of vegetation\r\nembarrasses the Indians in the chase; and in their rivers, resembling\r\narms of the sea, the depth of the waters prevents fishing during whole\r\nmonths. Those species of ruminating animals, that constitute the\r\nwealth of the nations of the Old World, are wanting in the New. The\r\nbison and the musk-ox have never been reduced to a domestic state; the\r\nbreeding of llamas and guanacos has not created the habits of pastoral\r\nlife. In the temperate zone, on the banks of the Missouri, as well as\r\non the tableland of New Mexico, the American is a hunter; but in the\r\ntorrid zone, in the forests of Guiana, he cultivates cassava,\r\nplantains, and sometimes maize. Such is the admirable fertility of\r\nnature, that the field of the native is a little spot of land, to\r\nclear which requires only setting fire to the brambles; and putting a\r\nfew seeds or slips into the ground is all the husbandry it demands. If\r\nwe go back in thought to the most remote ages, in these thick forests\r\nwe must always figure to ourselves nations deriving the greater part\r\nof their nourishment from the earth; but, as this earth produces\r\nabundance in a small space, and almost without toil, we may also\r\nimagine these nations often changing their dwellings along the banks\r\nof the same river. Even now the native of the Orinoco travels with his\r\nseeds; and transports his farm (conuco) as the Arab transports his\r\ntent, and changes his pasturage. The number of cultivated plants found\r\nwild amid the woods, proves the nomad habits of an agricultural\r\npeople. Can we be surprised, that by these habits they lose almost all\r\nthe advantages that result in the temperate zone from stationary\r\nculture, from the growth of corn, which requires extensive lands and\r\nthe most assiduous labour?\r\n\r\nThe nations of the Upper Orinoco, the Atabapo, and the Inirida, like\r\nthe ancient Germans and the Persians, have no other worship than that\r\nof the powers of nature. They call the good principle Cachimana; it is\r\nthe Manitou, the Great Spirit, that regulates the seasons, and favours\r\nthe harvests. Along with Cachimana there is an evil principle,\r\nIolokiamo, less powerful, but more artful, and in particular more\r\nactive. The Indians of the forest, when they occasionally visit the\r\nmissions, conceive with difficulty the idea of a temple or an image.\r\n\"These good people,\" said the missionary, \"like only processions in\r\nthe open air. When I last celebrated the festival of San Antonio, the\r\npatron of my village, the Indians of Inirida were present at mass.\r\n'Your God,' said they to me, 'keeps himself shut up in a house, as if\r\nhe were old and infirm; ours is in the forest, in the fields, and on\r\nthe mountains of Sipapu, whence the rains come.'\" Among the more\r\nnumerous, and on this account less barbarous tribes, religious\r\nsocieties of a singular kind are formed. Some old Indians pretend to\r\nbe better instructed than others on points regarding divinity; and to\r\nthem is confided the famous botuto, of which I have spoken, and which\r\nis sounded under the palm-trees that they may bear abundance of fruit.\r\nOn the banks of the Orinoco there exists no idol, as among all the\r\nnations who have remained faithful to the first worship of nature, but\r\nthe botuto, the sacred trumpet, is an object of veneration. To be\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of the botuto, it is requisite to be of\r\npure morals, and to have lived single. The initiated are subjected to\r\nflagellations, fastings, and other painful exercises. There are but a\r\nsmall number of these sacred trumpets. The most anciently celebrated\r\nis that upon a hill near the confluence of the Tomo and the Guainia.\r\nIt is pretended, that it is heard at once on the banks of the Tuamini,\r\nand at the mission of San Miguel de Davipe, a distance of ten leagues.\r\nFather Cereso assured us, that the Indians speak of the botuto of Tomo\r\nas an object of worship common to many surrounding tribes. Fruit and\r\nintoxicating liquors are placed beside the sacred trumpet. Sometimes\r\nthe Great Spirit himself makes the botuto resound; sometimes he is\r\ncontent to manifest his will through him to whom the keeping of the\r\ninstrument is entrusted. These juggleries being very ancient (from the\r\nfathers of our fathers, say the Indians), we must not be surprised\r\nthat some unbelievers are already to be found; but they express their\r\ndisbelief of the mysteries of the botuto only in whispers. Women are\r\nnot permitted to see this marvellous instrument; and are excluded from\r\nall the ceremonies of this worship. If a woman have the misfortune to\r\nsee the trumpet, she is put to death without mercy. The missionary\r\nrelated to us, that in 1798 he was happy enough to save a young girl,\r\nwhom a jealous and vindictive lover accused of having followed, from a\r\nmotive of curiosity, the Indians who sounded the botuto in the\r\nplantations. \"They would not have murdered her publicly,\" said father\r\nCesero, \"but how was she to be protected from the fanaticism of the\r\nnatives, in a country where it is so easy to give poison? The young\r\ngirl told me of her fears, and I sent her to one of the missions of\r\nthe Lower Orinoco.\" If the people of Guiana had remained masters of\r\nthat vast country; if, without having been impeded by Christian\r\nsettlements, they could follow freely the development of their\r\nbarbarous institutions; the worship of the botuto would no doubt\r\nbecome of some political importance. That mysterious society of the\r\ninitiated, those guardians of the sacred trumpet, would be transformed\r\ninto a ruling caste of priests, and the oracle of Tomo would gradually\r\nform a link between the bordering nations.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 4th of May we were informed, that an Indian, who\r\nhad assisted in dragging our bark over the portage of Pimichin, had\r\nbeen stung by a viper. He was a tall strong man, and was brought to\r\nthe mission in a very alarming state. He had dropped down senseless;\r\nand nausea, vertigo, and congestions in the head, had succeeded the\r\nfainting. The liana called vejeco de guaco,* which M. Mutis has\r\nrendered so celebrated, and which is the most certain remedy for the\r\nbite of venomous serpents, is yet unknown in these countries. (* This\r\nis a mikania, which was confounded for some time in Europe with the\r\nayapana. De Candolle thinks that the guaco may be the Eupatorium\r\nsatureiaefolium of Lamarck; but this Eupatorium differs by its lineary\r\nleaves, while the Mikania guaco has triangular, oval, and very large\r\nleaves.) A number of Indians hastened to the hut of the sick man, and\r\nhe was cured by an infusion of raiz de mato. We cannot indicate with\r\ncertainty what plant furnishes this antidote; but I am inclined to\r\nthink, that the raiz de mato is an apocynea, perhaps the Cerbera\r\nthevetia, called by the inhabitants of Cumana lingua de mato or\r\ncontra-culebra, and which they also use against the bite of serpents.\r\nA genus nearly allied to the cerbera* (* Ophioxylon serpentinum.) is\r\nemployed in India for the same purpose. It is common enough to find in\r\nthe same family of plants vegetable poisons, and antidotes against the\r\nvenom of reptiles. Many tonics and narcotics are antidotes more or\r\nless active; and we find these in families very different* from each\r\nother, in the aristolochiae, the apocyneae, the gentianae, the\r\npolygalae, the solaneae, the compositae, the malvaceae, the\r\ndrymyrhizeae, and, which is still more surprising, even in the\r\npalm-trees. (* I shall mention as examples of these nine families;\r\nAristolochia anguicida, Cerbera thevetia, Ophoiorhiza mungos, Polygala\r\nsenega, Nicotiana tabacum, (One of the remedies most used in Spanish\r\nAmerica). Mikanua guaco, Hibiscus abelmoschus (the seeds of which are\r\nvery active), Lanpujum rumphii, and Kunthia montana (Cana de la\r\nVibora).)\r\n\r\nIn the hut of the Indian who had been so dangerously bitten by the\r\nviper, we found balls two or three inches in diameter, of an earthy\r\nand impure salt called chivi, which is prepared with great care by the\r\nnatives. At Maypures a conferva is burnt, which is left by the Orinoco\r\non the neighbouring rocks, when, after high swellings, it again enters\r\nits bed. At Javita a salt is fabricated by the incineration of the\r\nspadix and fruit of the palm-tree seje or chimu. This fine palm-tree,\r\nwhich abounds on the banks of the Auvana, near the cataract of\r\nGuarinumo, and between Javita and the Cano Pimichin, appears to be a\r\nnew species of cocoa-tree. It may be recollected, that the fluid\r\ncontained in the fruit of the common cocoa-tree is often saline, even\r\nwhen the tree grows far from the sea shore. At Madagascar salt is\r\nextracted from the sap of a palm-tree called ciro. Besides the spadix\r\nand the fruit of the seje palm, the Indians of Javita lixiviate also\r\nthe ashes of the famous liana called cupana, which is a new species of\r\nthe genus paullinia, consequently a very different plant from the\r\ncupania of Linnaeus. I may here mention, that a missionary seldom\r\ntravels without being provided with some prepared seeds of the cupana.\r\nThis preparation requires great care. The Indians scrape the seeds,\r\nmix them with flour of cassava, envelope the mass in plantain leaves,\r\nand set it to ferment in water, till it acquires a saffron-yellow\r\ncolour. This yellow paste dried in the sun, and diluted in water, is\r\ntaken in the morning as a kind of tea. The beverage is bitter and\r\nstomachic, but it appeared to me to have a very disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Niger, and in a great part of the interior of\r\nAfrica, where salt is extremely rare, it is said of a rich man, \"he is\r\nso fortunate as to eat salt at his meals.\" This good fortune is not\r\ntoo common in the interior of Guiana. The whites only, particularly\r\nthe soldiers of the little fort of San Carlos, know how to procure\r\npure salt, either from the coast of Caracas, or from Chita* by the Rio\r\nMeta. (* North of Morocote, at the eastern declivity of the Cordillera\r\nof New Grenada. The salt of the coasts, which the Indians call\r\nyuquira, costs two piastres the almuda at San Carlos.) Here, as\r\nthroughout America, the Indians eat little meat, and consume scarcely\r\nany salt. The chivi of Javita is a mixture of muriate of potash and of\r\nsoda, of caustic lime, and of several other earthy salts. The Indians\r\ndissolve a few particles in water, fill with this solution a leaf of\r\nheliconia folded in a conical form, and let drop a little, as from the\r\nextremity of a filter, on their food.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May we set off, to follow on foot our canoe, which had\r\nat length arrived, by the portage, at the Cano Pimichin. We had to\r\nford a great number of streams; and these passages require some\r\ncaution on account of the vipers with which the marshes abound. The\r\nIndians pointed out to us on the moist clay the traces of the little\r\nblack bears so common on the banks of the Temi. They differ at least\r\nin size from the Ursus americanus. The missionaries call them osso\r\ncarnicero, to distinguish them from the osso palmero or tamanoir\r\n(Myrmecophaga jubata), and from the osso hormigero, or anteater\r\n(tamandua). The flesh of these animals is good to eat; the first two\r\ndefend themselves by rising on their hind feet. The tamanoir of Buffon\r\nis called uaraca by the Indians; it is irascible and courageous, which\r\nis extraordinary in an animal without teeth. We found, as we advanced,\r\nsome vistas in the forest, which appeared to us the richer, as it\r\nbecame more accessible. We here gathered some new species of coffee\r\n(the American tribe, with flowers in panicles, forms probably a\r\nparticular genus); the Galega piscatorum, of which the Indians make\r\nuse, as they do of jacquinia, and of a composite plant of the Rio\r\nTemi, as a kind of barbasco, to intoxicate fish; and finally, the\r\nliana, known in those countries by the name of vejuco de mavacure,\r\nwhich yields the famous curare poison. It is neither a phyllanthus,\r\nnor a coriaria, as M. Willdenouw conjectured, but, as M. Kunth's\r\nresearches show, very probably a strychnos. We shall have occasion,\r\nfarther on, to speak of this venomous substance, which is an important\r\nobject of trade among the savages.\r\n\r\nThe trees of the forest of Pimichin have the gigantic height of from\r\neighty to a hundred and twenty feet. In these burning climates the\r\nlaurineae and amyris* (* The great white and red cedars of these\r\ncountries are not the Cedrela odorata, but the Amyris altissima, which\r\nis an icica of Aublet.) furnish that fine timber for building, which,\r\non the north-west coast of America, on mountains where the thermometer\r\nfalls in winter to 20 degrees centigrade below zero, we find in the\r\nfamily of the coniferae. Such, in every zone, and in all the families\r\nof American plants, is the prodigious force of vegetation, that, in\r\nthe latitude of fifty-seven degrees north, on the same isothermal line\r\nwith St. Petersburgh and the Orkneys, the Pinus canadensis displays\r\ntrunks one hundred and fifty feet high, and six feet in diameter.* (*\r\nLangsdorf informs us that the inhabitants of Norfolk Sound make boats\r\nof a single trunk, fifty feet long, four feet and a half broad, and\r\nthree high at the sides. They contain thirty persons. These boats\r\nremind us of the canoes of the Rio Chagres in the isthmus of Panama,\r\nin the torrid zone. The Populus balsamifera also attains an immense\r\nheight, on the mountains that border Norfolk Sound.) Towards night we\r\narrived at a small farm, in the puerto or landing place of Pimichin.\r\nWe were shown a cross near the road, which marked the spot where a\r\npoor capuchin missionary had been killed by wasps. I state this on the\r\nauthority of the monks of Javita and the Indians. They talk much in\r\nthese countries of wasps and venomous ants, but we saw neither one nor\r\nthe other of these insects. It is well known that in the torrid zone\r\nslight stings often cause fits of fever almost as violent as those\r\nthat with us accompany severe organic injuries. The death of this poor\r\nmonk was probably the effect of fatigue and damp, rather than of the\r\nvenom contained in the stings of wasps, which the Indians dread\r\nextremely. We must not confound the wasps of Javita with the melipones\r\nbees, called by the Spaniards angelitos (little angels) which covered\r\nour faces and hands on the summit of the Silla de Caracas.\r\n\r\nThe landing place of Pimichin is surrounded by a small plantation of\r\ncacao-trees; they are very vigorous, and here, as on the banks of the\r\nAtabapo and the Guainia, they are loaded with flowers and fruits at\r\nall seasons. They begin to bear from the fourth year; on the coast of\r\nCaracas they do not bear till the sixth or eighth year. The soil of\r\nthese countries is sandy, wherever it is not marshy; but the light\r\nlands of the Tuamini and Pimichin are extremely productive.* (* At\r\nJavita, an extent of fifty feet square, planted with Jatropha manihot\r\n(yucca) yields in two years, in the worst soil, a harvest of six\r\ntortas of cassava: the same extent on a middling soil yields in\r\nfourteen months a produce of nine tortas. In an excellent soil, around\r\nclumps of mauritia, there is every year from fifty feet square a\r\nproduce of thirteen or fourteen tortas. A torta weighs three quarters\r\nof a pound, and three tortas cost generally in the province of Caracas\r\none silver rial, or one-eighth of a piastre. These statements appear\r\nto me to be of some importance, when we wish to compare the nutritive\r\nmatter which man can obtain from the same extent of soil, by covering\r\nit, in different climates, with bread-trees, plantains, jatropha,\r\nmaize, potatoes, rice, and corn. The tardiness of the harvest of\r\njatropha has, I believe, a beneficial influence on the manners of the\r\nnatives, by fixing them to the soil, and compelling them to sojourn\r\nlong on the same spot.) Around the conucos of Pimichin grows, in its\r\nwild state, the igua, a tree resembling the Caryocar nuciferum which\r\nis cultivated in Dutch and French Guiana, and which, with the\r\nalmendron of Mariquita (Caryocar amygdaliferum), the juvia of the\r\nEsmeralda (Bertholletia excelsa), and the Geoffroea of the Amazon,\r\nyields the finest almonds of all South America. No commercial\r\nadvantage is here made of the igua; but I saw vessels arrive on the\r\ncoast of Terra Firma, that came from Demerara laden with the fruit of\r\nthe Caryocar tomentosum, which is the Pekea tuberculosa of Aublet.\r\nThese trees reach a hundred feet in height, and present, by the beauty\r\nof their corolla, and the multitude of their stamens, a magnificent\r\nappearance. I should weary the reader by continuing the enumeration of\r\nthe vegetable wonders which these vast forests contain. Their variety\r\ndepends on the coexistence of such a great number of families in a\r\nsmall space of ground, on the stimulating power of light and heat, and\r\non the perfect elaboration of the juices that circulate in these\r\ngigantic plants.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in a hut lately abandoned by an Indian family, who\r\nhad left behind them their fishing-tackle, pottery, nets made of the\r\npetioles of palm-trees; in short, all that composes the household\r\nfurniture of that careless race of men, little attached to property. A\r\ngreat store of mani (a mixture of the resin of the moronoboea and the\r\nAmyris carana) was accumulated round the house. This is used by the\r\nIndians here, as at Cayenne, to pitch their canoes, and fix the bony\r\nspines of the ray at the points of their arrows. We found in the same\r\nplace jars filled with a vegetable milk, which serves as a varnish,\r\nand is celebrated in the missions by the name of leche para pintar\r\n(milk for painting). They coat with this viscous juice those articles\r\nof furniture to which they wish to give a fine white colour. It\r\nthickens by the contact of the air, without growing yellow, and it\r\nappears singularly glossy. We have already mentioned that the\r\ncaoutchouc is the oily part, the butter of all vegetable milk. It is,\r\nno doubt, a particular modification of caoutchouc that forms this\r\ncoagulum, this white and glossy skin, that seems as if covered with\r\ncopal varnish. If different colours could be given to this milky\r\nvarnish, a very expeditious method would be found of painting and\r\nvarnishing our carriages by one process. The more we study vegetable\r\nchemistry in the torrid zone, the more we shall discover, in remote\r\nspots, and half-prepared in the organs of plants, products which we\r\nbelieve belong only to the animal kingdom, or which we obtain by\r\nprocesses which are often tedious and difficult. Already we have found\r\nthe wax that coats the palm-tree of the Andes of Quindiu, the silk of\r\nthe palm-tree of Mocoa, the nourishing milk of the palo de vaca, the\r\nbutter-tree of Africa, and the caseous substances obtained from the\r\nalmost animalized sap of the Carica papaya. These discoveries will be\r\nmultiplied, when, as the political state of the world seems now to\r\nindicate, European civilization shall flow in a great measure toward\r\nthe equinoctial regions of the New Continent.\r\n\r\nThe marshy tract between Javita and the embarcadero of Pimichin is\r\ninfested with great numbers of vipers. Before we took possession of\r\nthe deserted hut, the Indians killed two great mapanare serpents.* (*\r\nThis name is given in the Spanish colonies to very different species.\r\nThe Coluber mapanare of the province of Caracas has one hundred and\r\nforty-two ventral plates, and thirty-eight double caudal scales. The\r\nColuber mapanare of the Rio Magdalena has two hundred and eight\r\nventral plates, and sixty-four double caudal scales.) These grow to\r\nfour or five feet long. They appeared to me to be the same species as\r\nthose I saw in the Rio Magdalena. This serpent is a beautiful animal,\r\nbut extremely venomous, white on the belly, and spotted with brown and\r\nred on the back. As the inside of the hut was filled with grass, and\r\nwe were lying on the ground, there being no means of suspending our\r\nhammocks, we were not without inquietude during the night. In the\r\nmorning a large viper was found on lifting the jaguar-skin upon which\r\none of our domestics had slept. The Indians say that these reptiles,\r\nslow in their movements when they are not pursued, creep near a man\r\nbecause they are fond of heat. In fact, on the banks of the Magdalena\r\na serpent entered the bed of one of our fellow-travellers, and\r\nremained there a part of the night, without injuring him. Without\r\nwishing to take up the defence of vipers and rattlesnakes, I believe\r\nit may be affirmed that, if these venomous animals had such a\r\ndisposition for offence as is supposed, the human species would\r\ncertainly not have withstood their numbers in some parts of America;\r\nfor instance, on the banks of the Orinoco and the humid mountains of\r\nChoco.\r\n\r\nWe embarked on the 8th of May at sunrise, after having carefully\r\nexamined the bottom of our canoe. It had become thinner, but had\r\nreceived no crack in the portage. We reckoned that it would still bear\r\nthe voyage of three hundred leagues, which we had yet to perform, in\r\ngoing down the Rio Negro, ascending the Cassiquiare, and redescending\r\nthe Orinoco as far as Angostura. The Pimichin, which is called a\r\nrivulet (cano) is tolerably broad; but small trees that love the water\r\nnarrow the bed so much that there remains open a channel of only\r\nfifteen or twenty toises. Next to the Rio Chagres this river is one of\r\nthe most celebrated in America for the number of its windings: it is\r\nsaid to have eighty-five, which greatly lengthen it. They often form\r\nright angles, and occur every two or three leagues. To determine the\r\ndifference of longitude between the landing-place and the point where\r\nwe were to enter the Rio Negro, I took by the compass the course of\r\nthe Cano Pimichin, and noted the time during which we followed the\r\nsame direction. The velocity of the current was only 2.4 feet in a\r\nsecond; but our canoe made by rowing 4.6 feet. The embarcadero of the\r\nPimichin appeared to me to be eleven thousand toises west of its\r\nmouth, and 0 degrees 2 minutes west of the mission of Javita. This\r\nCano is navigable during the whole year, and has but one raudal, which\r\nis somewhat difficult to go up; its banks are low, but rocky. After\r\nhaving followed the windings of the Pimichin for four hours and a half\r\nwe at length entered the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe morning was cool and beautiful. We had now been confined\r\nthirty-six days in a narrow boat, so unsteady that it would have been\r\noverset by any person rising imprudently from his seat, without\r\nwarning the rowers. We had suffered severely from the sting of\r\ninsects, but we had withstood the insalubrity of the climate; we had\r\npassed without accident the great number of waterfalls and bars, which\r\nimpede the navigation of the rivers, and often render it more\r\ndangerous than long voyages by sea. After all we had endured, it may\r\nbe conceived that we felt no little satisfaction in having reached the\r\ntributary streams of the Amazon, having passed the isthmus that\r\nseparates two great systems of rivers, and in being sure of having\r\nfulfilled the most important object of our journey, namely, to\r\ndetermine astronomically the course of that arm of the Orinoco which\r\nfalls into the Rio Negro, and of which the existence has been\r\nalternately proved and denied during half a century. In proportion as\r\nwe draw near to an object we have long had in view, its interest seems\r\nto augment. The uninhabited banks of the Cassiquiare, covered with\r\nforests, without memorials of times past, then occupied my\r\nimagination, as do now the banks of the Euphrates, or the Oxus,\r\ncelebrated in the annals of civilized nations. In that interior part\r\nof the New Continent one may almost accustom oneself to regard men as\r\nnot being essential to the order of nature. The earth is loaded with\r\nplants, and nothing impedes their free development. An immense layer\r\nof mould manifests the uninterrupted action of organic powers.\r\nCrocodiles and boas are masters of the river; the jaguar, the peccary,\r\nthe dante, and the monkeys traverse the forest without fear and\r\nwithout danger; there they dwell as in an ancient inheritance. This\r\naspect of animated nature, in which man is nothing, has something in\r\nit strange and sad. To this we reconcile ourselves with difficulty on\r\nthe ocean, and amid the sands of Africa; though in scenes where\r\nnothing recalls to mind our fields, our woods, and our streams, we are\r\nless astonished at the vast solitude through which we pass. Here, in a\r\nfertile country, adorned with eternal verdure, we seek in vain the\r\ntraces of the power of man; we seem to be transported into a world\r\ndifferent from that which gave us birth. These impressions are the\r\nmore powerful in proportion as they are of long duration. A soldier,\r\nwho had spent his whole life in the missions of the Upper Orinoco,\r\nslept with us on the bank of the river. He was an intelligent man,\r\nwho, during a calm and serene night, pressed me with questions on the\r\nmagnitude of the stars, on the inhabitants of the moon, on a thousand\r\nsubjects of which I was as ignorant as himself. Being unable by my\r\nanswers to satisfy his curiosity, he said to me in a firm tone of the\r\nmost positive conviction: \"with respect to men, I believe there are no\r\nmore up there than you would have found if you had gone by land from\r\nJavita to Cassiquiare. I think I see in the stars, as here, a plain\r\ncovered with grass, and a forest (mucho monte) traversed by a river.\"\r\nIn citing these words I paint the impression produced by the\r\nmonotonous aspect of those solitary regions. May this monotony not be\r\nfound to extend to the journal of our navigation, and weary the reader\r\naccustomed to the description of the scenes and historical memorials\r\nof the old continent!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.23.\r\n\r\nTHE RIO NEGRO.\r\nBOUNDARIES OF BRAZIL.\r\nTHE CASSIQUIARE.\r\nBIFURCATION OF THE ORINOCO.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Negro, compared to the Amazon, the Rio de la Plata, or the\r\nOrinoco, is but a river of the second order. Its possession has been\r\nfor ages of great political importance to the Spanish Government,\r\nbecause it is capable of furnishing a rival power, Portugal, with an\r\neasy passage into the missions of Guiana, and thereby disturbing the\r\nCapitania general of Caracas in its southern limits. Three hundred\r\nyears have been spent in vain territorial disputes. According to the\r\ndifference of times, and the degree of civilization among the natives,\r\nresource has been had sometimes to the authority of the Pope, and\r\nsometimes the support of astronomy; and the disputants being generally\r\nmore interested in prolonging than in terminating the struggle, the\r\nnautical sciences and the geography of the New Continent, have alone\r\ngained by this interminable litigation. When the affairs of Paraguay,\r\nand the possession of the colony of Del Sacramento, became of great\r\nimportance to the courts of Madrid and Lisbon, commissioners of the\r\nboundaries were sent to the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Rio Plata.\r\n\r\nThe little that was known, up to the end of the last century, of the\r\nastronomical geography of the interior of the New Continent, was owing\r\nto these estimable and laborious men, the French and Spanish\r\nacademicians, who measured a meridian line at Quito, and to officers\r\nwho went from Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres to join the expedition of\r\nMalaspina. Those persons who know the inaccuracy of the maps of South\r\nAmerica, and have seen those uncultivated lands between the Jupura and\r\nthe Rio Negro, the Madeira and the Ucayale, the Rio Branco and the\r\ncoasts of Cayenne, which up to our own days have been gravely disputed\r\nin Europe, can be not a little surprised at the perseverance with\r\nwhich the possession of a few square leagues is litigated. These\r\ndisputed grounds are generally separated from the cultivated part of\r\nthe colonies by deserts, the extent of which is unknown. In the\r\ncelebrated conferences of Puente de Caya the question was agitated,\r\nwhether, in fixing the line of demarcation three hundred and seventy\r\nSpanish leagues to the west of the Cape Verde Islands, the pope meant\r\nthat the first meridian should be reckoned from the centre of the\r\nisland of St. Nicholas, or (as the court of Portugal asserted) from\r\nthe western extremity of the little island of St. Antonio. In the year\r\n1754, the time of the expedition of Iturriaga and Solano, negociations\r\nwere entered into respecting the possession of the then desert banks\r\nof the Tuamini, and of a marshy tract which we crossed in one evening\r\ngoing from Javita to Cano Pimichin. The Spanish commissioners very\r\nrecently would have placed the divisional line at the point where the\r\nApoporis falls into the Jupura, while the Portuguese astronomers\r\ncarried it back as far as Salto Grande.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Negro and the Jupuro are two tributary streams of the Amazon,\r\nand may be compared in length to the Danube. The upper parts belong to\r\nthe Spaniards, while the lower are occupied by the Portuguese. The\r\nChristian settlements are very numerous from Mocoa to the mouth of the\r\nCaguan; while on the Lower Jupura the Portuguese have founded only a\r\nfew villages. On the Rio Negro, on the contrary, the Spaniards have\r\nnot been able to rival their neighbours. Steppes and forests nearly\r\ndesert separate, at a distance of one hundred and sixty leagues, the\r\ncultivated part of the coast from the four missions of Marsa, Tomo,\r\nDavipe, and San Carlos, which are all that the Spanish Franciscans\r\ncould establish along the Rio Negro. Among the Portuguese of Brazil\r\nthe military system, that of presides and capitanes pobladores, has\r\nprevailed over the government of the missionaries. Grand Para is no\r\ndoubt far distant from the mouth of the Rio Negro: but the facility of\r\nnavigation on the Amazon, which runs like an immense canal in one\r\ndirection from west to east, has enabled the Portuguese population to\r\nextend itself rapidly along the river. The banks of the Lower Maranon,\r\nfrom Vistoza as far as Serpa, as well as those of the Rio Negro from\r\nFort da Bara to San Jose da Maravitanos, are embellished by rich\r\ncultivation, and by a great number of large villages and towns.\r\n\r\nThese local considerations are combined with others, suggested by the\r\nmoral position of nations. The north-west coast of America furnishes\r\nto this day no other stable settlements but Russian and Spanish\r\ncolonies. Before the inhabitants of the United States, in their\r\nprogressive movement from east to west, could reach the shore between\r\nthe latitude 41 and 50 degrees, which long separated the Spanish monks\r\nand the Siberian hunters,* the latter had established themselves south\r\nof the Columbia River. (* The hunters connected with military posts,\r\nand dependent on the Russian Company, of which the principal\r\nshareholders live at Irkutsk. In 1804 the little fortress (krepost) at\r\nthe bay of Jakutal was still six hundred leagues distant from the most\r\nnorthern Mexican possessions.) Thus in New California the Franciscan\r\nmissionaries, men estimable for their morals, and their agricultural\r\nactivity, learnt with astonishment, that Greek priests had arrived in\r\ntheir neighbourhood; and that two nations, who inhabit the eastern and\r\nwestern extremities of Europe, were become neighbours on a coast of\r\nAmerica opposite to China. In Guiana circumstances were very\r\ndifferent: the Spaniards found on their frontiers those very\r\nPortuguese, who, by their language, and their municipal institutions,\r\nform with them one of the most noble remains of Roman Europe; but whom\r\nmistrust, founded on unequal strength, and too great proximity, has\r\nconverted into an often hostile, and always rival power.\r\n\r\nIf two nations adjacent to each other in Europe, the Spaniards and the\r\nPortuguese, have alike become neighbours in the New Continent, they\r\nare indebted for that circumstance to the spirit of enterprise and\r\nactive courage which both displayed at the period of their military\r\nglory and political greatness. The Castilian language is now spoken in\r\nNorth and South America throughout an extent of more than one thousand\r\nnine hundred leagues in length; if, however, we consider South America\r\napart, we there find the Portuguese language spread over a larger\r\nspace of ground, and spoken by a smaller number of individuals than\r\nthe Castilian. It would seem as if the bond that so closely connects\r\nthe fine languages of Camoens and Lope de Vega, had served only to\r\nseparate two nations, who have become neighbours against their will.\r\nNational hatred is not modified solely by a diversity of origin, of\r\nmanners, and of progress in civilization; whenever it is powerful, it\r\nmust be considered as the effect of geographical situation, and the\r\nconflicting interests thence resulting. Nations detest each other the\r\nless, in proportion as they are distant; and when, their languages\r\nbeing radically different, they do not even attempt to combine\r\ntogether. Travellers who have passed through New California, the\r\ninterior provinces of Mexico, and the northern frontiers of Brazil,\r\nhave been struck by these shades in the moral dispositions of\r\nbordering nations.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the Spanish Rio Negro, the divergent politics of the\r\ncourts of Lisbon and Madrid had augmented that system of mistrust\r\nwhich, even in calmer times, the commanders of petty neighbouring\r\nforts love to encourage. Boats went up from Barcelos as far as the\r\nSpanish missions, but the communications were of rare occurrence. A\r\ncommandant with sixteen or eighteen soldiers wearied the garrison by\r\nmeasures of safety, which were dictated by the important state of\r\naffairs; if he were attacked, he hoped to surround the enemy. When we\r\nspoke of the indifference with which the Portuguese government\r\ndoubtless regarded the four little villages founded by the monks of\r\nSaint Francisco, on the Upper Guainia, the inhabitants were hurt by\r\nthe motives which we alleged with the view to give them confidence. A\r\npeople who have preserved in vigour, through the revolutions of ages,\r\na national hatred, like occasions of giving it vent. The mind delights\r\nin everything impassioned, in the consciousness of an energetic\r\nfeeling, in the affections, and in rival hatreds that are founded on\r\nantiquated prejudices. Whatever constitutes the individuality of\r\nnations flows from the mother-country to the most remote colonies; and\r\nnational antipathies are not effaced where the influence of the same\r\nlanguages ceases. We know, from the interesting narrative of\r\nKrusenstern's voyage, that the hatred of two fugitive sailors, one a\r\nFrenchman and the other an Englishman, was the cause of a long war\r\nbetween the inhabitants of the Marquesas Islands. On the banks of the\r\nAmazon and the Rio Negro, the Indians of the neighbouring Portuguese\r\nand Spanish villages detest each other. These poor people speak only\r\nthe native tongues; they are ignorant of what passes on the other bank\r\nof the ocean, beyond the great salt-pool; but the gowns of their\r\nmissionaries are of a different colour, and this displeases them\r\nextremely.\r\n\r\nI have stopped to paint the effects of national animosities, which\r\nwise statesmen have endeavoured to calm, but have been unable entirely\r\nto set at rest. This rivalry has contributed to the imperfection of\r\nthe geographical knowledge hitherto obtained respecting the tributary\r\nrivers of the Amazon. When the communications of the natives are\r\nimpeded, and one nation is established near the mouth, and another in\r\nthe upper part of the same river, it is difficult for persons who\r\nattempt to construct maps to acquire precise information. The\r\nperiodical inundations, and still more the portages, by which boats\r\nare passed from one stream to another, the sources of which are in the\r\nsame neighbourhood, have led to erroneous ideas of the bifurcations\r\nand branchings of rivers. The Indians of the Portuguese missions, for\r\ninstance, enter (as I was informed upon the spot) the Spanish Rio\r\nNegro on one side by the Rio Guainia and the Rio Tomo; and the Upper\r\nOrinoco on the other, by the portages between the Cababuri, the\r\nPacimoni, the Idapa, and the Macava, to gather the aromatic seeds of\r\nthe puchero laurel beyond the Esmeralda. The Indians, I repeat, are\r\nexcellent geographers; they outflank the enemy, notwithstanding the\r\nlimits traced upon the maps, in spite of the forts and the\r\nestacamentos; and when the missionaries see them arrive from such\r\ndistances, and in different seasons, they begin to frame hypotheses of\r\nsupposed communications of rivers. Each party has an interest in\r\nconcealing what it knows with certainty; and that love of the\r\nmysterious, so general among the ignorant, contributes to perpetuate\r\nthe doubt. It may also be observed that the various Indian nations,\r\nwho frequent this labyrinth of rivers, give them names entirely\r\ndifferent; and that these names are disguised and lengthened by\r\nterminations that signify water, great water, and current. How often\r\nhave I been perplexed by the necessity of settling the synonyms of\r\nrivers, when I have sent for the most intelligent natives, to\r\ninterrogate them, through an interpreter, respecting the number of\r\ntributary streams, the sources of the rivers, and the portages. Three\r\nor four languages being spoken in the same mission, it is difficult to\r\nmake the witnesses agree. Our maps are loaded with names arbitrarily\r\nshortened or perverted. To examine how far they may be accurate, we\r\nmust be guided by the geographical situation of the confluent rivers,\r\nI might almost say by a certain etymological tact. The Rio Uaupe, or\r\nUapes of the Portuguese maps, is the Guapue of the Spanish maps, and\r\nthe Ucayari of the natives. The Anava of the old geographers is the\r\nAnauahu of Arrowsmith, and the Uanauhau or Guanauhu of the Indians.\r\nThe desire of leaving no void in the maps, in order to give them an\r\nappearance of accuracy, has caused rivers to be created, to which\r\nnames have been applied that have not been recognized as synonymous.\r\nIt is only lately that travellers in America, in Persia, and in the\r\nIndies, have felt the importance of being correct in the denomination\r\nof places. When we read the travels of Sir Walter Raleigh, it is\r\ndifficult indeed to recognise in the lake of Mrecabo, the laguna of\r\nMaracaybo, and in the Marquis Paraco the name of Pizarro, the\r\ndestroyer of the empire of the Incas.\r\n\r\nThe great tributary streams of the Amazon are designated by the\r\nmissionaries by different names in their upper and lower course. The\r\nIza is called, higher up, Putumayo, the Jupura towards its source\r\nbears the name of Caqueta. The researches made in the missions of the\r\nAndaquies on the real origin of the Rio Negro have been the more\r\nfruitless because the Indian name of the river was unknown. I heard it\r\ncalled Guainia at Javita, Maroa, and San Carlos. Southey, in his\r\nhistory of Brazil, says expressly that the Rio Negro, in the lower\r\npart of its course, is called Guiani, or Curana, by the natives; in\r\nthe upper part, Ueneya. It is the word Gueneya, instead of Guainia;\r\nfor the Indians of those countries say indifferently Guaranacua or\r\nOuaranacua, Guarapo or Uarapo.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Rio Negro have long been an object of contention\r\namong geographers. The interest we feel in this question is not merely\r\nthat which attaches to the origin of all great rivers, but is\r\nconnected with a crowd of other questions, that comprehend the\r\nsupposed bifurcations of the Caqueta, the communications between the\r\nRio Negro and the Orinoco, and the local fable of El Dorado, formerly\r\ncalled Enim, or the empire of the Grand Paytiti. When we study with\r\ncare the ancient maps of these countries, and the history of their\r\ngeographical errors, we see how by degrees the fable of El Dorado has\r\nbeen transported towards the west with the sources of the Orinoco. It\r\nwas at first fixed on the eastern declivity of the Andes, to the\r\nsouth-west of the Rio Negro. The valiant Philip de Urre sought for the\r\ngreat city of Manoa by traversing the Guaviare. Even now the Indians\r\nof San Jose de Maravitanos relate that, on sailing to the north-east\r\nfor fifteen days, on the Guape or Uaupe, you reach a famous laguna de\r\noro, surrounded by mountains, and so large that the opposite shore\r\ncannot be discerned. A ferocious nation, the Guanes, do not permit the\r\ncollecting of the gold of a sandy plain that surrounds the lake.\r\nFather Acunha places the lake Manoa, or Yenefiti, between the Jupura\r\nand the Rio Negro. Some Manoa Indians brought Father Fritz, in 1687,\r\nseveral slips of beaten gold. This nation, the name of which is still\r\nknown on the banks of the Urarira, between Lamalongo and Moreira,\r\ndwelt on the Yurubesh. La Condamine is right in saying that this\r\nMesopotamia, between the Caqueta, the Rio Negro, the Yurubesh, and the\r\nIquiare, was the first scene of El Dorado. But where shall we find the\r\nnames of Yurubesh and Iquiare, given by the Fathers Acunha and Fritz?\r\nI think I recognise them in the rivers Urubaxi and Iguari,* on some\r\nmanuscript Portuguese maps which I possess. (* It may be written\r\nUrubaji. The j and the x were the same as the German ch to Father\r\nFritz. The Urubaxi, or Hyurubaxi (Yurubesh), falls into the Rio Negro\r\nnear Santa Isabella; the Iguari (Iquiare?) runs into the Issana, which\r\nis also a tributary of the Rio Negro.) I have long and assiduously\r\nstudied the geography of South America, north of the Amazon, from\r\nancient maps and unpublished materials. Desirous that my work should\r\npreserve the character of a scientific performance, I ought not to\r\nhesitate about treating of subjects on which I flatter myself that I\r\ncan throw some light; namely, on the questions respecting the sources\r\nof the Rio Negro and the Orinoco, the communication between these\r\nrivers and the Amazon, and the problem of the auriferous soil, which\r\nhas cost the inhabitants of the New World so much suffering and so\r\nmuch blood.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of the waters circulating on the surface of the\r\nglobe, as well as in the structure of organic bodies, nature has\r\npursued a much less complicated plan than has been believed by those\r\nwho have suffered themselves to be guided by vague conceptions and a\r\ntaste for the marvellous. We find, too, that all anomalies, all the\r\nexceptions to the laws of hydrography, which the interior of America\r\ndisplays, are merely apparent; that the course of running waters\r\nfurnishes phenomena equally extraordinary in the old world, but that\r\nthese phenomena, from their littleness, have less struck the\r\nimagination of travellers. When immense rivers may be considered as\r\ncomposed of several parallel furrows of unequal depth; when these\r\nrivers are not enclosed in valleys; and when the interior of the great\r\ncontinent is as flat as the shores of the sea with us; the\r\nramifications, the bifurcations, and the interlacings in the form of\r\nnet-work, must be infinitely multiplied. From what we know of the\r\nequilibrium of the seas, I cannot think that the New World issued from\r\nthe waters later than the Old, and that organic life is there younger,\r\nor more recent; but without admitting oppositions between the two\r\nhemispheres of the same planet, we may conceive that in the hemisphere\r\nmost abundant in waters the different systems of rivers required more\r\ntime to separate themselves from one another, and establish their\r\ncomplete independence. The deposits of mud, which are formed wherever\r\nthe running waters lose somewhat of their swiftness, contribute, no\r\ndoubt, to raise the beds of the great confluent streams, and augment\r\ntheir inundations; but at length these deposits entirely obstruct the\r\nbranches of the rivers and the narrow channels that connect the\r\nneighbouring streams. The substances washed down by rain-waters form\r\nby their accumulation new bars, isthmuses of deposited earth, and\r\npoints of division that did not before exist. It hence results that\r\nthese natural channels of communication are by degrees divided into\r\ntwo tributary streams, and from the effect of a transverse rising,\r\nacquire two opposite slopes; a part of their waters is turned back\r\ntowards the principal recipient, and a buttress rises between the two\r\nparallel basins, which occasions all traces of their ancient\r\ncommunication to disappear. From this period the bifurcations no\r\nlonger connect different systems of rivers; and, where they continue\r\nto take place at the time of great inundations, we see that the waters\r\ndiverge from the principal recipient only to enter it again after a\r\nlonger or shorter circuit. The limits, which at first appeared vague\r\nand uncertain, begin to be fixed; and in the lapse of ages, from the\r\naction of whatever is moveable on the surface of the globe, from that\r\nof the waters, the deposits, and the sands, the basins of rivers\r\nseparate, as great lakes are subdivided, and as inland seas lose their\r\nancient communications.* (* The geological constitution of the soil\r\nseems to indicate that, notwithstanding the actual difference of level\r\nin their waters, the Black Sea, the Caspian, and lake Aral,\r\ncommunicated with each other in an era anterior to historic times. The\r\noverflowing of the Aral into the Caspian Sea seems even to be partly\r\nof a more recent date, and independent of the bifurcation of the Gihon\r\n(Oxus), on which one of the most learned geographers of our day, M.\r\nRitter, has thrown new light.)\r\n\r\nThe certainty acquired by geographers since the sixteenth century, of\r\nthe existence of several bifurcations, and the mutual dependence of\r\nvarious systems of rivers in South America, have led them to admit an\r\nintimate connection between the five great tributary streams of the\r\nOrinoco and the Amazon; the Guaviare, the Inirida, the Rio Negro, the\r\nCaqueta or Hyapura, and the Putumayo or Iza.\r\n\r\nThe Meta, the Guaviare, the Caqueta, and the Putumayo, are the only\r\ngreat rivers that rise immediately from the eastern declivity of the\r\nAndes of Santa Fe, Popayan, and Pasto. The Vichada, the Zama, the\r\nInirida, the Rio Negro, the Uaupe, and the Apoporis, which are marked\r\nin our maps as extending westward as far as the mountains, take rise\r\nat a great distance from them, either in the savannahs between the\r\nMeta and the Guaviare, or in the mountainous country which, according\r\nto the information given me by the natives, begins at four or five\r\ndays' journey westward of the missions of Javita and Maroa, and\r\nextends through the Sierra Tuhuny, beyond the Xie, towards the banks\r\nof the Issana.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that this ridge of the Cordilleras, which contains\r\nthe sources of so many majestic rivers (the Meta, the Guaviare, the\r\nCaqueta, and the Putumayo), is as little covered with snow as the\r\nmountains of Abyssinia from which flow the waters of the Blue Nile;\r\nbut, on the contrary, on going up the tributary streams which furrow\r\nthe plains, a volcano as found still in activity, before you reach the\r\nCordillera of the Andes. This phenomenon was discovered by the\r\nFranciscan monks, who go down from Ceja by the Rio Fragua to Caqueta.\r\nA solitary hill, emitting smoke night and day, is found on the\r\nnorth-east of the mission of Santa Rosa, and west of the Puerto del\r\nPescado. This is the effect of a lateral action of the volcanoes of\r\nPopayan and Pasto; as Guacamayo and Sangay, situated also at the foot\r\nof the eastern declivity of the Andes, are the effect of a lateral\r\naction produced by the system of the volcanoes of Quito. After having\r\nclosely inspected the banks of the Orinoco and the Rio Negro, where\r\nthe granite everywhere pierces the soil; when we reflect on the total\r\nabsence of volcanoes in Brazil, Guiana, on the coast of Venezuela, and\r\nperhaps in all that part of the continent lying eastward of the Andes;\r\nwe contemplate with interest the three burning volcanoes situated near\r\nthe sources of the Caqueta, the Napo, and the Rio de Macas or Morona.\r\n\r\nThe little group of mountains with which we became acquainted at the\r\nsources of the Guainia, is remarkable from its being isolated in the\r\nplain that extends to the south-west of the Orinoco. Its situation\r\nwith regard to longitude might lead to the belief that it stretches\r\ninto a ridge, which forms first the strait (angostura) of the\r\nGuaviare, and then the great cataracts (saltos, cachoeiras) of the\r\nUaupe and the Jupura. Does this ground, composed probably of primitive\r\nrocks, like that which I examined more to the east, contain\r\ndisseminated gold? Are there any gold-washings more to the south,\r\ntoward the Uaupe, on the Iquiare (Iguiari, Iguari), and on the\r\nYurubesh (Yurubach, Urubaxi)? It was there that Philip von Huten first\r\nsought El Dorado, and with a handful of men fought the battle of\r\nOmaguas, so celebrated in the sixteenth century. In separating what is\r\nfabulous from the narratives of the Conquistadores, we cannot fail to\r\nrecognize in the names preserved on the same spots a certain basis of\r\nhistoric truth. We follow the expedition of Huten beyond the Guaviare\r\nand the Caqeta; we find in the Guaypes, governed by the cacique of\r\nMacatoa, the inhabitants of the river of Uaupe, which also bears the\r\nname of Guape, or Guapue; we call to mind, that Father Acunha calls\r\nthe Iquiari (Quiquiare) a gold river; and that fifty years later\r\nFather Fritz, a missionary of great veracity, received, in the mission\r\nof Yurimaguas, the Manaos (Manoas), adorned with plates of beaten\r\ngold, coming from the country between the Uaupe and the Caqueta, or\r\nJupura. The rivers that rise on the eastern declivity of the Andes\r\n(for instance the Napo) carry along with them a great deal of gold,\r\neven when their sources are found in trachytic soils. Why may there\r\nnot be an alluvial auriferous soil to the east of the Cordilleras, as\r\nthere is to the west, in the Sonoro, at Choco, and at Barbacoas? I am\r\nfar from wishing to exaggerate the riches of this soil; but I do not\r\nthink myself authorized to deny the existence of precious metals in\r\nthe primitive mountains of Guiana, merely because in our journey\r\nthrough that country we saw no metallic veins. It is somewhat\r\nremarkable that the natives of the Orinoco have a name in their\r\nlanguages for gold (carucuru in Caribbee, caricuri in Tamanac, cavitta\r\nin Maypure), while the word they use to denote silver, prata, is\r\nmanifestly borrowed from the Spanish.* (* The Parecas say, instead of\r\nprata, rata. It is the Castilian word plata ill-pronounced. Near the\r\nYurubesh there is another inconsiderable tributary stream of the Rio\r\nNegro, the Curicur-iari. It is easy to recognize in this name the\r\nCaribbee word carucur, gold. The Caribs extended their incursions from\r\nthe mouth of the Orinoco south-west toward the Rio Negro; and it was\r\nthis restless people who carried the fable of El Dorado, by the same\r\nway, but in an opposite direction (from south-west to north-east),\r\nfrom the Mesopotamia between the Rio Negro and the Jupura to the\r\nsources of the Rio Branco.) The notions collected by Acunha, Father\r\nFritz, and La Condamine, on the gold-washings south and north of the\r\nriver Uaupe, agree with what I learnt of the auriferous soil of those\r\ncountries. However great we may suppose the communications that took\r\nplace between the nations of the Orinoco before the arrival of\r\nEuropeans, they certainly did not draw their gold from the eastern\r\ndeclivity of the Cordilleras. This declivity is poor in mines,\r\nparticularly in mines anciently worked; it is almost entirely composed\r\nof volcanic rocks in the provinces of Popayan, Pasto, and Quito. The\r\ngold of Guiana probably came from the country east of the Andes. In\r\nour days a lump of gold has been found in a ravine near the mission of\r\nEncaramada, and we must not be surprised if, since Europeans settled\r\nin these wild spots, we hear less of the plates of gold, gold-dust,\r\nand amulets of jade-stone, which could heretofore be obtained from the\r\nCaribs and other wandering nations by barter. The precious metals,\r\nnever very abundant on the banks of the Orinoco, the Rio Negro, and\r\nthe Amazon, disappeared almost entirely when the system of the\r\nmissions caused the distant communications between the natives to\r\ncease.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Upper Guainia in general abound much less in\r\nfishing-birds than those of Cassiquiare, the Meta, and the Arauca,\r\nwhere ornithologists would find sufficient to enrich immensely the\r\ncollections of Europe. This scarcity of animals arises, no doubt, from\r\nthe want of shoals and flat shores, as well as from the quality of the\r\nblack waters, which (on account of their very purity) furnish less\r\naliment to aquatic insects and fish. However, the Indians of these\r\ncountries, during two periods of the year, feed on birds of passage,\r\nwhich repose in their long migrations on the waters of the Rio Negro.\r\nWhen the Orinoco begins to swell* after the vernal equinox, an\r\ninnumerable quantity of ducks (patos careteros) remove from the eighth\r\nto the third degree of north latitude, to the first and fourth degree\r\nof south latitude, towards the south-south-east. (* The swellings of\r\nthe Nile take place much later than those of the Orinoco; after the\r\nsummer solstice, below Syene; and at Cairo in the beginning of July.\r\nThe Nile begins to sink near that city generally about the 15th of\r\nOctober, and continues sinking till the 20th of May.) These animals\r\nthen abandon the valley of the Orinoco, no doubt because the\r\nincreasing depth of waters, and the inundations of the shores, prevent\r\nthem from catching fish, insects, and aquatic worms. They are killed\r\nby thousands in their passage across the Rio Negro. When they go\r\ntowards the equator they are very fat and savoury; but in the month of\r\nSeptember, when the Orinoco decreases and returns into its bed, the\r\nducks, warned either by the voices of the most experienced birds of\r\npassage, or by that internal feeling which, not knowing how to define,\r\nwe call instinct, return from the Amazon and the Rio Branco towards\r\nthe north. At this period they are too lean to tempt the appetite of\r\nthe Indians of the Rio Negro, and escape pursuit more easily from\r\nbeing accompanied by a species of herons (gavanes) which are excellent\r\neating. Thus the Indians eat ducks in March, and herons in September.\r\nWe could not learn what becomes of the gavanes during the swellings of\r\nthe Orinoco, and why they do not accompany the patos careteros in\r\ntheir migration from the Orinoco to the Rio Branco. These regular\r\nmigrations of birds from one part of the tropics towards another, in a\r\nzone which is during the whole year of the same temperature, are very\r\nextraordinary phenomena. The southern coasts of the West India Islands\r\nreceive also every year, at the period of the inundations of the great\r\nrivers of Terra Firma, numerous flights of the fishing-birds of the\r\nOrinoco, and of its tributary streams. We must presume that the\r\nvariations of drought and humidity in the equinoctial zone have the\r\nsame influence as the great changes of temperature in our climates, on\r\nthe habits of animals. The heat of summer, and the pursuit of insects,\r\ncall the humming-birds into the northern parts of the United States,\r\nand into Canada as far as the parallels of Paris and Berlin: in the\r\nsame manner a greater facility for fishing draws the web-footed and\r\nlong-legged birds from the north to the south, from the Orinoco\r\ntowards the Amazon. Nothing is more marvellous, and nothing is yet\r\nknown less clearly in a geographical point of view, than the\r\ndirection, extent, and term of the migrations of birds.\r\n\r\nAfter having entered the Rio Negro by the Pimichin, and passed the\r\nsmall cataract at the confluence of the two rivers, we discovered, at\r\nthe distance of a quarter of a league, the mission of Maroa. This\r\nvillage, containing one hundred and fifty Indians, presented an\r\nappearance of ease and prosperity. We purchased some fine specimens of\r\nthe toucan alive; a courageous bird, the intelligence of which is\r\ndeveloped like that of our domestic ravens. We passed on the right,\r\nabove Maroa, first the mouth of the Aquio* (Aqui, Aaqui, Ake, of the\r\nmost recent maps.), then that of the Tomo.* (* Tomui, Temujo, Tomon.)\r\nOn the banks of the latter river dwell the Cheruvichahenas, some\r\nfamilies of whom I have seen at San Francisco Solano. The Tomo lies\r\nnear the Rio Guaicia (Xie), and the mission of Tomo receives by that\r\nway fugitive Indians from the Lower Guainia. We did not enter the\r\nmission, but Father Zea related to us with a smile, that the Indians\r\nof Tomo and Maroa had been one day in full insurrection, because an\r\nattempt was made to force them to dance the famous dance of the\r\ndevils. The missionary had taken a fancy to have the ceremonies by\r\nwhich the piaches (who are at once priests, physicians, and conjurors)\r\nevoke the evil spirit Iolokiamo, represented in a burlesque manner. He\r\nthought that the dance of the devils would be an excellent means of\r\nproving to the neophytes that Iolokiamo had no longer any power over\r\nthem. Some young Indians, confiding in the promises of the missionary,\r\nconsented to act the devils, and were already decorated with black and\r\nyellow plumes, and jaguar-skins with long sweeping tails. The place\r\nwhere the church stands was surrounded by the soldiers who are\r\ndistributed in the missions, in order to add more effect to the\r\ncounsels of the monks; and those Indians who were not entirely\r\nsatisfied with respect to the consequences of the dance, and the\r\nimpotency of the evil spirit, were brought to the festivity. The\r\noldest and most timid of the Indians, however, imbued all the rest\r\nwith a superstitious dread; all resolved to flee al monte, and the\r\nmissionary adjourned his project of turning into derision the demon of\r\nthe natives. What extravagant ideas may sometimes enter the\r\nimagination of an idle monk, who passes his life in the forests, far\r\nfrom everything that can recall human civilization to his mind. The\r\nviolence with which the attempt was made to execute in public at Tomo\r\nthe mysterious dance of the devils is the more strange, as all the\r\nbooks written by the missionaries relate the efforts they have used to\r\nprevent the funereal dances, the dances of the sacred trumpet, and\r\nthat ancient dance of serpents, the Queti, in which these wily animals\r\nare represented as issuing from the forests, and coming to drink with\r\nthe men in order to deceive them, and carry off the women.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours' navigation from the mouth of the Tomo we arrived at\r\nthe little mission of San Miguel de Davipe, founded in 1775, not by\r\nmonks, but by a lieutenant of militia, Don Francisco Bobadilla. The\r\nmissionary of the place, Father Morillo, with whom we spent some\r\nhours, received us with great hospitality. He even offered us Madeira\r\nwine, but, as an object of luxury, we should have preferred wheaten\r\nbread. The want of bread becomes more sensibly felt in length of time\r\nthan that of a strong liquor. The Portuguese of the Amazon carry small\r\nquantities of Madeira wine, from time to time, to the Rio Negro; and\r\nthe word madera, signifying wood in the Castilian language, the monks,\r\nwho are not much versed in the study of geography, had a scruple of\r\ncelebrating mass with Madeira wine, which they took for a fermented\r\nliquor extracted from the trunk of some tree, like palm-wine; and\r\nrequested the guardian of the missions to decide, whether the vino de\r\nmadera were wine from grapes, or the juice of a tree. At the beginning\r\nof the conquest, the question was agitated, whether it were allowable\r\nfor the priests, in celebrating mass, to use any fermented liquor\r\nanalogous to grape-wine. The question, as might have been foreseen,\r\nwas decided in the negative.\r\n\r\nAt Davipe we bought some provisions, among which were fowls and a pig.\r\nThis purchase greatly interested our Indians, who had been a long\r\nwhile deprived of meat. They pressed us to depart, in order to reach\r\nthe island of Dapa, where the pig was to be killed and roasted during\r\nthe night. We had scarcely time to examine in the convent (convento)\r\nthe great stores of mani resin, and cordage of the chiquichiqui palm,\r\nwhich deserves to be more known in Europe. This cordage is extremely\r\nlight; it floats upon the water, and is more durable in the navigation\r\nof rivers than ropes of hemp. It must be preserved at sea by being\r\noften wetted, and little exposed to the heat of the tropical sun. Don\r\nAntonio Santos, celebrated in the country for his journey in search of\r\nlake Parima, taught the Indians of the Spanish Rio Negro to make use\r\nof the petioles of the chiquichiqui, a palm-tree with pinnate leaves,\r\nof which we saw neither the flowers nor the fruit. This officer is the\r\nonly white man who ever came from Angostura to Grand Para, passing by\r\nland from the sources of the Rio Carony to those of the Rio Branco. He\r\nhad studied the mode of fabricating ropes from the chiquichiqui in the\r\nPortuguese colonies; and, on his return from the Amazon, he introduced\r\nthis branch of industry into the missions of Guiana. It were to be\r\nwished that extensive rope-walks could be established on the banks of\r\nthe Rio Negro and the Cassiquiare, in order to make these cables an\r\narticle of trade with Europe. A small quantity is already exported\r\nfrom Angostura to the West Indies; and it costs from fifty to sixty\r\nper cent less than cordage of hemp. Young palm-trees only being\r\nemployed, they must be planted and carefully cultivated.\r\n\r\nA little above the mission of Davipe, the Rio Negro receives a branch\r\nof the Cassiquiare, the existence of which is a very remarkable\r\nphenomenon in the history of the branchings of rivers. This branch\r\nissues from the Cassiquiare, north of Vasiva, bearing the name of the\r\nItinivini; and, after flowing for the length of twenty-five leagues\r\nthrough a flat and almost uninhabited country, it falls into the Rio\r\nNegro under the name of the Rio Conorichite. It appeared to me to be\r\nmore than one hundred and twenty toises broad near its mouth. Although\r\nthe current of the Conorichite is very rapid, this natural canal\r\nabridges by three days the passage from Davipe to Esmeralda. We cannot\r\nbe surprised at a double communication between the Cassiquiare and the\r\nRio Negro when we recollect that so many of the rivers of America\r\nform, as it were, deltas at their confluence with other rivers. Thus\r\nthe Rio Branco and the Rio Jupura enter by a great number of branches\r\ninto the Rio Negro and the Amazon. At the confluence of the Jupura\r\nthere is a much more extraordinary phenomenon. Before this river joins\r\nthe Amazon, the latter, which is the principal recipient, sends off\r\nthree branches called Uaranapu, Manhama, and Avateparana, to the\r\nJupura, which is but a tributary stream. The Portuguese astronomer,\r\nRibeiro, has proved this important fact. The Amazon gives waters to\r\nthe Jupura itself, before it receives that tributary stream.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Conorichite, or Itinivini, formerly facilitated the trade in\r\nslaves carried on by the Portuguese in the Spanish territory. The\r\nslave-traders went up by the Cassiquiare and the Cano Mee to\r\nConorichite; and thence dragged their canoes by a portage to the\r\nrochelas of Manuteso, in order to enter the Atabapo. This abominable\r\ntrade lasted till about the year 1756; when the expedition of Solano,\r\nand the establishment of the missions on the banks of the Rio Negro,\r\nput an end to it. Old laws of Charles V and Philip III* (* 26 January\r\n1523 and 10 October 1618.) had forbidden under the most severe\r\npenalties (such as the being rendered incapable of civil employment,\r\nand a fine of two thousand piastres), the conversion of the natives to\r\nthe faith by violent means, and sending armed men against them; but\r\nnotwithstanding these wise and humane laws, the Rio Negro, in the\r\nmiddle of the last century, was no further interesting in European\r\npolitics, than as it facilitated the entradas, or hostile incursions,\r\nand favoured the purchase of slaves. The Caribs, a trading and warlike\r\npeople, received from the Portuguese and the Dutch, knives,\r\nfish-hooks, small mirrors, and all sorts of glass beads. They excited\r\nthe Indian chiefs to make war against each other, bought their\r\nprisoners, and carried off, themselves, by stratagem or force, all\r\nwhom they found in their way. These incursions of the Caribs\r\ncomprehended an immense extent of land; they went from the banks of\r\nthe Essequibo and the Carony, by the Rupunuri and the Paraguamuzi on\r\none side, directly south towards the Rio Branco; and on the other, to\r\nthe south-west, following the portages between the Rio Paragua, the\r\nCaura, and the Ventuario. The Caribs, when they arrived amid the\r\nnumerous tribes of the Upper Orinoco, divided themselves into several\r\nbands, in order to reach, by the Cassiquiare, the Cababury, the\r\nItinivini, and the Atabapo, on a great many points at once, the banks\r\nof the Guiainia or Rio Negro, and carry on the slave-trade with the\r\nPortuguese. Thus the unhappy natives, before they came into immediate\r\ncontact with the Europeans, suffered from their proximity. The same\r\ncauses produce everywhere the same effects. The barbarous trade which\r\ncivilized nations have carried on, and still partially continue, on\r\nthe coast of Africa, extends its fatal influence even to regions where\r\nthe existence of white men is unknown.\r\n\r\nHaving quitted the mouth of the Conorichite and the mission of Davipe,\r\nwe reached at sunset the island of Dapa, lying in the middle of the\r\nriver, and very picturesquely situated. We were astonished to find on\r\nthis spot some cultivated ground, and on the top of a small hill an\r\nIndian hut. Four natives were seated round a fire of brushwood, and\r\nthey were eating a sort of white paste with black spots, which much\r\nexcited our curiosity. These black spots proved to be vachacos, large\r\nants, the hinder parts of which resemble a lump of grease. They had\r\nbeen dried, and blackened by smoke. We saw several bags of them\r\nsuspended above the fire. These good people paid but little attention\r\nto us; yet there were more than fourteen persons in this confined hut,\r\nlying naked in hammocks hung one above another. When Father Zea\r\narrived, he was received with great demonstrations of joy. The\r\nmilitary are in greater numbers on the banks of the Rio Negro than on\r\nthose of the Orinoco, owing to the necessity of guarding the\r\nfrontiers; and wherever soldiers and monks dispute for power over the\r\nIndians, the latter are most attached to the monks. Two young women\r\ncame down from their hammocks, to prepare for us cakes of cassava. In\r\nanswer to some enquiries which we put to them through an interpreter,\r\nthey answered that cassava grew poorly on the island, but that it was\r\na good land for ants, and food was not wanting. In fact, these\r\nvachacos furnish subsistence to the Indians of the Rio Negro and the\r\nGuainia. They do not eat the ants as a luxury, but because, according\r\nto the expression of the missionaries, the fat of ants (the white part\r\nof the abdomen) is a very substantial food. When the cakes of cassava\r\nwere prepared, Father Zea, whose fever seemed rather to sharpen than\r\nto enfeeble his appetite, ordered a little bag to be brought to him\r\nfilled with smoked vachacos. He mixed these bruised insects with flour\r\nof cassava, which he pressed us to taste. It somewhat resembled rancid\r\nbutter mixed with crumb of bread. The cassava had not an acid taste,\r\nbut some remains of European prejudices prevented our joining in the\r\npraises bestowed by the good missionary on what he called an excellent\r\nant paste.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the rain obliged us to sleep in this crowded hut. The\r\nIndians slept only from eight till two in the morning; the rest of the\r\ntime they employed in conversing in their hammocks, and preparing\r\ntheir bitter beverage of cupana. They threw fresh fuel on the fire,\r\nand complained of cold, although the temperature of the air was at 21\r\ndegrees. This custom of being awake, and even on foot, four or five\r\nhours before sunrise, is general among the Indians of Guiana. When, in\r\nthe entradas, an attempt is made to surprise the natives, the hours\r\nchosen are those of the first sleep, from nine till midnight.\r\n\r\nWe left the island of Dapa long before daybreak; and notwithstanding\r\nthe rapidity of the current, and the activity of our rowers, our\r\npassage to the fort of San Carlos del Rio Negro occupied twelve hours.\r\nWe passed, on the left, the mouth of the Cassiquiare, and, on the\r\nright, the small island of Cumarai. The fort is believed in the\r\ncountry to be on the equatorial line; but, according to the\r\nobservations which I made at the rocks of Culimacari, it is in 1\r\ndegree 54 minutes 11 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe lodged at San Carlos with the commander of the fort, a lieutenant\r\nof militia. From a gallery in the upper part of the house we enjoyed a\r\ndelightful view of three islands of great length, and covered with\r\nthick vegetation. The river runs in a straight line from north to\r\nsouth, as if its bed had been dug by the hand of man. The sky being\r\nconstantly cloudy gives these countries a solemn and gloomy character.\r\nWe found in the village a few juvia-trees which furnish the triangular\r\nnuts called in Europe the almonds of the Amazon, or Brazil-nuts. We\r\nhave made it known by the name of Bertholletia excelsa. The trees\r\nattain after eight years' growth the height of thirty feet.\r\n\r\nThe military establishment of this frontier consisted of seventeen\r\nsoldiers, ten of whom were detached for the security of the\r\nneighbouring missions. Owing to the extreme humidity of the air there\r\nare not four muskets in a condition to be fired. The Portuguese have\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty men, better clothed and armed, at the\r\nlittle fort of San Jose de Maravitanos. We found in the mission of San\r\nCarlos but one garita,* a square house, constructed with unbaked\r\nbricks, and containing six field-pieces. (* This word literally\r\nsignifies a sentry-box; but it is here employed in the sense of\r\nstore-house or arsenal.) The little fort, or, as they think proper to\r\ncall it here, the Castillo de San Felipe, is situated opposite San\r\nCarlos, on the western bank of the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Upper Guainia will be more productive when, by the\r\ndestruction of the forests, the excessive humidity of the air and the\r\nsoil shall be diminished. In their present state of culture maize\r\nscarcely grows, and the tobacco, which is of the finest quality, and\r\nmuch celebrated on the coast of Caracas, is well cultivated only on\r\nspots amid old ruins, remains of the huts of the pueblo viejo (old\r\ntown). Indigo grows wild near the villages of Maroa, Davipe, and Tomo.\r\nUnder a different system from that which we found existing in these\r\ncountries, the Rio Negro will produce indigo, coffee, cacao, maize,\r\nand rice, in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the mouth of the Rio Negro to Grand Para occupying\r\nonly twenty or twenty-five days, it would not have taken us much more\r\ntime to have gone down the Amazon as far as the coast of Brazil, than\r\nto return by the Cassiquiare and the Orinoco to the northern coast of\r\nCaracas. We were informed at San Carlos that, on account of political\r\ncircumstances, it was difficult at that moment to pass from the\r\nSpanish to the Portuguese settlements; but we did not know till after\r\nour return to Europe the extent of the danger to which we should have\r\nbeen exposed in proceeding as far as Barcellos. It was known at\r\nBrazil, possibly through the medium of the newspapers, that I was\r\ngoing to visit the missions of the Rio Negro, and examine the natural\r\ncanal which unites two great systems of rivers. In those desert\r\nforests instruments had been seen only in the hands of the\r\ncommissioners of the boundaries; and at that time the subaltern agents\r\nof the Portuguese government could not conceive how a man of sense\r\ncould expose himself to the fatigues of a long journey, to measure\r\nlands that did not belong to him. Orders had been issued to seize my\r\nperson, my instruments, and, above all, those registers of\r\nastronomical observations, so dangerous to the safety of states. We\r\nwere to be conducted by way of the Amazon to Grand Para, and thence\r\nsent back to Lisbon. But fortunately for me, the government at Lisbon,\r\non being informed of the zeal of its subaltern agents, instantly gave\r\norders that I should not be disturbed in my operations; but that on\r\nthe contrary they should be encouraged, if I traversed any part of the\r\nPortuguese possessions.\r\n\r\nIn going down the Guainia, or Rio Negro, you pass on the right the\r\nCano Maliapo, and on the left the Canos Dariba and Eny. At five\r\nleagues distance, nearly in 1 degree 38 minutes of north latitude, is\r\nthe island of San Josef. A little below that island, in a spot where\r\nthere are a great number of orange-trees now growing wild, the\r\ntraveller is shown a small rock, two hundred feet high, with a cavern\r\ncalled by the missionaries the Glorieta de Cocuy. This summer-house\r\n(for such is the signification of the word glorieta in Spanish)\r\nrecalls remembrances that are not the most agreeable. It was here that\r\nCocuy, the chief of the Manitivitanos,* had his harem of women, and\r\nwhere he devoured the finest and fattest. (* At San Carlos there is\r\nstill preserved an instrument of music, a kind of large drum,\r\nornamented with very rude Indian paintings, which relate to the\r\nexploits of Cocuy.) The tradition of the harem and the orgies of Cocuy\r\nis more current in the Lower Orinoco than on the banks of the Guainia.\r\nAt San Carlos the very idea that the chief of the Manitivitanos could\r\nbe guilty of cannibalism is indignantly rejected.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese government has established many settlements even in\r\nthis remote part of Brazil. Below the Glorieta, in the Portuguese\r\nterritory, there are eleven villages in an extent of twenty-five\r\nleagues. I know of nineteen more as far as the mouth of the Rio Negro,\r\nbeside the six towns of Thomare, Moreira (near the Rio Demenene, or\r\nUaraca, where dwelt anciently the Guiana Indians), Barcellos, San\r\nMiguel del Rio Branco, near the river of the same name (so well known\r\nin the fictions of El Dorado), Moura, and Villa de Rio Negro. The\r\nbanks of this tributary stream of the Amazon alone are consequently\r\nten times more thickly peopled than all the shores of the Upper and\r\nLower Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, and the Spanish Rio\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\nAmong the tributary streams which the Rio Negro receives from the\r\nnorth, three are particularly deserving of attention, because on\r\naccount of their branchings, their portages, and the situation of\r\ntheir sources, they are connected with the often-discussed problem of\r\nthe origin of the Orinoco. The most southern of these tributary\r\nstreams are the Rio Branco,* which was long believed to issue\r\nconjointly with the Orinoco from lake Parime (* The Portuguese name,\r\nRio Branco, signifies White Water. Rio Parime is a Caribbean name,\r\nsignifying Great Water. These names having also been applied to\r\ndifferent tributary streams, have caused many errors in geography. The\r\ngreat Rio Branco, or Parime, often mentioned in this work, is formed\r\nby the Urariquera and the Tacutu, and flows, between Carvoeyro and\r\nVilla de Moura, into the Rio Negro. It is the Quecuene of the natives;\r\nand forms at its confluence with the Rio Negro a very narrow delta,\r\nbetween the principal trunk and the Amayauhau, which is a little\r\nbranch more to the west.), and the Rio Padaviri, which communicates by\r\na portage with the Mavaca, and consequently with the Upper Orinoco, to\r\nthe east of the mission of Esmeralda. We shall have occasion to speak\r\nof the Rio Branco and the Padaviri, when we arrive in that mission; it\r\nsuffices here to pause at the third tributary stream of the Rio Negro,\r\nthe Cababury, the interbranchings of which with the Cassiquiare are\r\nalike important in their connexion with hydrography, and with the\r\ntrade in sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nThe lofty mountains of the Parime, which border the northern bank of\r\nthe Orinoco in the upper part of its course above Esmeralda, send off\r\na chain towards the south, of which the Cerro de Unturan forms one of\r\nthe principal summits. This mountainous country, of small extent but\r\nrich in vegetable productions, above all, in the mavacure liana,\r\nemployed in preparing the wourali poison, in almond-trees (the juvia,\r\nor Bertholletia excelsa), in aromatic pucheries, and in wild\r\ncacao-trees, forms a point of division between the waters that flow to\r\nthe Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro. The tributary streams\r\non the north, or those of the Orinoco, are the Mavaca and the\r\nDaracapo; those on the west, or of the Cassiquiare, are the Idapa and\r\nthe Pacimoni; and those on the south, or of the Rio Negro, are the\r\nPadaviri and the Cababuri. The latter is divided near its source into\r\ntwo branches, the westernmost of which is known by the name of Baria.\r\nThe Indians of the mission of San Francisco Solano gave us the most\r\nminute description of its course. It affords the very rare example of\r\na branch by which an inferior tributary stream, instead of receiving\r\nthe waters of the superior stream, sends to it a part of its own\r\nwaters in a direction opposite to that of the principal recipient.\r\n\r\nThe Cababuri runs into the Rio Negro near the mission of Nossa Senhora\r\ndas Caldas; but the rivers Ya and Dimity, which are higher tributary\r\nstreams, communicate also with the Cababuri; so that, from the little\r\nfort of San Gabriel de Cachoeiras as far as San Antonio de Castanheira\r\nthe Indians of the Portuguese possessions can enter the territory of\r\nthe Spanish missions by the Baria and the Pacimoni.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of these incursions is the collection of sarsaparilla\r\nand the aromatic seeds of the puchery-laurel (Laurus pichurim). The\r\nsarsaparilla of these countries is celebrated at Grand Para,\r\nAngostura, Cumana, Nueva Barcelona, and in other parts of Terra Firma,\r\nby the name of zarza del Rio Negro. It is much preferred to the zarza\r\nof the Province of Caracas, or of the mountains of Merida; it is dried\r\nwith great care, and exposed purposely to smoke, in order that it may\r\nbecome blacker. This liana grows in profusion on the humid declivities\r\nof the mountains of Unturan and Achivaquery. Decandolle is right in\r\nsuspecting that different species of smilax are gathered under the\r\nname of sarsaparilla. We found twelve new species, among which the\r\nSmilax siphylitica of the Cassiquaire, and the Smilax officinalis of\r\nthe river Magdalena, are most esteemed on account of their diuretic\r\nproperties. The quantity of sarsaparilla employed in the Spanish\r\ncolonies as a domestic medicine is very considerable. We see by the\r\nworks of Clusius, that at the beginning of the Conquista, Europe\r\nobtained this salutary medicament from the Mexican coast of Honduras\r\nand the port of Guayaquil. The trade in zarza is now more active in\r\nthose ports which have interior communications with the Orinoco, the\r\nRio Negro, and the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe trials made in several botanical gardens of Europe prove that the\r\nSmilax glauca of Virginia, which it is pretended is the S.\r\nsarsaparilla of Linnaeus, may be cultivated in the open air, wherever\r\nthe mean winter temperature rises above six or seven degrees of the\r\ncentigrade thermometer*: but those species that possess the most\r\nactive virtues belong exclusively to the torrid zone, and require a\r\nmuch higher degree of heat. (* The winter temperature at London and\r\nParis is 4.2 and 3.7; at Montpelier, 6.7; at Rome, 7.7 degrees. In\r\nthat part of Mexico, and the Terra Firma, where we saw the most active\r\nspecies of the sarsaparilla growing (that which supplies the trade of\r\nthe Spanish and Portuguese colonies), the temperature is from twenty\r\nto twenty-six degrees. The roots of another family of monocotyledons\r\n(of some cyperaceae) possess also diaphoretic and resolvent\r\nproperties. The Carex arenaria, the C. hirta, etc. furnish the German\r\nsarsaparilla of druggists. According to Clusius, Europe received the\r\nfirst sarsaparilla from Yucatan, and the island of Puna, opposite\r\nGuayaquil.) In reading the works of Clusius, it can scarcely be\r\nconceived why our writers on the Materia Medica persist in considering\r\na plant of the United States as the most ancient type of the officinal\r\nspecies of the genus smilax.\r\n\r\nWe found in the possession of the Indians of the Rio Negro some of\r\nthose green stones, known by the name of Amazon stones, because the\r\nnatives pretend, according to an ancient tradition, that they come\r\nfrom the country of the women without husbands (Cougnantainsecouima),\r\nor women living alone (Aikeambenano*). (* This word is of the Tamanac\r\nlanguage; these women are the sole Donne of the Italian missionaries.)\r\nWe were told at San Carlos, and in the neighbouring villages, that the\r\nsources of the Orinoco, which we found east of the Esmeralda, and in\r\nthe missions of the Carony and at Angostura, that the sources of the\r\nRio Branco are the native spots of the green stones. These statements\r\nconfirm the report of an old soldier of the garrison of Cayenne\r\n(mentioned by La Condamine), who affirmed that those mineral\r\nsubstances were obtained from the country of women, west of the rapids\r\nof the Oyapoc. The Indians who inhabit the fort of Topayos on the\r\nAmazon five degrees east of the mouth of the Rio Negro, possessed\r\nformerly a great number of these stones. Had they received them from\r\nthe north, that is, from the country pointed out by the Indians of the\r\nRio Negro, which extends from the mountains of Cayenne towards the\r\nsources of the Essequibo, the Carony, the Orinoco, the Parime, and the\r\nRio Trombetas? or did they come from the south by the Rio Topayos,\r\nwhich descends from the vast table-land of the Campos Parecis?\r\nSuperstition attaches great importance to these mineral substances:\r\nthey are worn suspended from the neck as amulets, because, according\r\nto popular belief, they preserve the wearer from nervous complaints,\r\nfevers, and the stings of venomous serpents. They have consequently\r\nbeen for ages an article of trade among the natives, both north and\r\nsouth of the Orinoco. The Caribs, who may be considered as the\r\nBucharians of the New World, made them known along the coasts of\r\nGuiana; and the same stones, like money in circulation, passed\r\nsuccessively from nation to nation in opposite directions: their\r\nquantity is perhaps not augmented, and the spot which produces them is\r\nprobably unknown rather than concealed. In the midst of enlightened\r\nEurope, on occasion of a warm contest respecting native bark, a few\r\nyears ago, the green stones of the Orinoco were gravely proposed as a\r\npowerful febrifuge. After this appeal to the credulity of Europeans,\r\nwe cannot be surprised to learn that the Spanish planters share the\r\npredilection of the Indians for these amulets, and that they are sold\r\nat a very considerable price. The form given to them most frequently\r\nis that of the Babylonian cylinders,* longitudinally perforated, and\r\nloaded with inscriptions and figures. (The price of a cylinder two\r\ninches long is from twelve to fifteen piastres.) But this is not the\r\nwork of the Indians of our days, the natives of the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazon, whom we find in the last degree of barbarism. The Amazon\r\nstones, like the perforated and sculptured emeralds, found in the\r\nCordilleras of New Grenada and Quito, are vestiges of anterior\r\ncivilization. The present inhabitants of those countries, particularly\r\nin the hot region, so little comprehend the possibility of cutting\r\nhard stones (the emerald, jade, compact feldspar and rock-crystal),\r\nthat they imagine the green stone is soft when taken out of the earth,\r\nand that it hardens after having been moulded by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe natural soil of the Amazon-stone is not in the valley of the river\r\nAmazon. It does not derive its name from the river, but like the river\r\nitself, the stone has been named after a nation of warlike women, whom\r\nFather Acunha, and Oviedo, in his letter to cardinal Bembo, compare to\r\nthe Amazons of the ancient world. What we see in our cabinets under\r\nthe false denomination of Amazon-stone, is neither jade, nor compact\r\nfeldspar, but a common feldspar of an apple-green colour, that comes\r\nfrom the Ural mountains and on lake Onega in Russia, but which I never\r\nsaw in the granitic mountains of Guiana. Sometimes also this very rare\r\nand hard Amazon-stone is confounded with the hatchet-nephrite\r\n(beilstein)* of Werner, which has much less tenacity. (* Punamustein\r\n(jade axinien). The stone hatchets found in America, for instance in\r\nMexico, are not of beilstein, but of compact feldspar.) The substance\r\nwhich I obtained from the hands of the Indians, belongs to the\r\nsaussurite,* (* Jade of Saussure, according to the system of\r\nBrongniart; tenacious jade, and compact tenacious feldspar of Hauy;\r\nsome varieties of the variolithe of Werner.) to the real jade, which\r\nresembles compact feldspar, and which forms one of the constituent\r\nparts of the verde de Corsica, or gabbro.* (* Euphotide of Hauy, or\r\nschillerfels, of Raumer.) It takes a fine polish, and passes from\r\napple-green to emerald-green; it is translucent at the edges,\r\nextremely tenacious, and in a high degree sonorous. These Amazon\r\nstones were formerly cut by the natives into very thin plates,\r\nperforated at the centre, and suspended by a thread, and these plates\r\nyield an almost metallic sound if struck by another hard body.* (* M.\r\nBrongniart, to whom I showed these plates on my return to Europe, very\r\njustly compared these jades of Parime to the sonorous stones employed\r\nby the Chinese in their musical instruments called king.) This fact\r\nconfirms the connection which we find, notwithstanding the difference\r\nof fracture and of specific gravity between the saussurite and the\r\nsiliceous basis of the porphyrschiefer, which is the phonolite\r\n(klingstein). I have already observed, that, as it is very rare to\r\nfind in America nephrite, jade, or compact feldspar, in its native\r\nplace, we may well be astonished at the quantity of hatchets which are\r\neverywhere discovered in digging the earth, from the banks of the Ohio\r\nas far as Chile. We saw in the mountains of Upper Orinoco, or of\r\nParime, only granular granites containing a little hornblende,\r\ngranites passing into gneiss, and schistoid hornblendes. Has nature\r\nrepeated on the east of Esmeralda, between the sources of the Carony,\r\nthe Essequibo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Branco, the\r\ntransition-formation of Tucutunemo reposing on mica-schist? Does the\r\nAmazon-stone come from the rocks of euphotide, which form the last\r\nmember of the series of primitive rocks?\r\n\r\nWe find among the inhabitants of both hemispheres, at the first dawn\r\nof civilization, a peculiar predilection for certain stones; not only\r\nthose which, from their hardness, may be useful to man as cutting\r\ninstruments, but also for mineral substances, which, on account of\r\ntheir colour and their natural form, are believed to bear some\r\nrelation to the organic functions, and even to the propensities of the\r\nsoul. This ancient worship of stones, these benign virtues attributed\r\nto jade and haematite, belong to the savages of America as well as to\r\nthe inhabitants of the forests of Thrace. The human race, when in an\r\nuncultivated state, believes itself to have sprung from the ground;\r\nand feels as if it were enchained to the earth, and the substances\r\ncontained in her bosom. The powers of nature, and still more those\r\nwhich destroy than those which preserve, are the first objects of its\r\nworship. It is not solely in the tempest, in the sound that precedes\r\nthe earthquake, in the fire that feeds the volcano, that these powers\r\nare manifested; the inanimate rock; stones, by their lustre and\r\nhardness; mountains, by their mass and their solitude; act upon the\r\nuntaught mind with a force which, in a state of advanced civilization,\r\ncan no longer be conceived. This worship of stones, when once\r\nestablished, is preserved amidst more modern forms of worship; and\r\nwhat was at first the object of religious homage, becomes a source of\r\nsuperstitious confidence. Divine stones are transformed into amulets,\r\nwhich are believed to preserve the wearer from every ill, mental and\r\ncorporeal. Although a distance of five hundred leagues separates the\r\nbanks of the Amazon and the Orinoco from the Mexican table-land;\r\nalthough history records no fact that connects the savage nations of\r\nGuiana with the civilized nations of Anahuac, the monk Bernard de\r\nSahagun, at the beginning of the conquest, found preserved as relics\r\nat Cholula, certain green stones which had belonged to Quetzalcohuatl.\r\nThis mysterious personage is the Mexican Buddha; he appeared in the\r\ntime of the Toltecs, founded the first religious associations, and\r\nestablished a government similar to that of Meroe and of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe history of the jade, or the green stones of Guiana, is intimately\r\nconnected with that of the warlike women whom the travellers of the\r\nsixteenth century named the Amazons of the New World. La Condamine has\r\nproduced many testimonies in favour of this tradition. Since my return\r\nfrom the Orinoco and the river Amazon, I have often been asked, at\r\nParis, whether I embraced the opinion of that learned man, or\r\nbelieved, like several of his contemporaries, that he undertook the\r\ndefence of the Cougnantainsecouima (the independent women who received\r\nmen into their society only in the month of April), merely to fix, in\r\na public sitting of the Academy, the attention of an audience somewhat\r\neager for novelties. I may take this opportunity of expressing my\r\nopinion on a tradition which has so romantic an appearance; and I am\r\nfarther led to do this as La Condamine asserts that the Amazons of the\r\nRio Cayame* crossed the Maranon to establish themselves on the Rio\r\nNegro. (* Orellana, arriving at the Maranon by the Rio Coca and the\r\nNapo, fought with the Amazons, as it appears, between the mouth of the\r\nRio Negro and that of the Xingu. La Condamine asserts that in the\r\nseventeenth century they passed the Maranon between Tefe and the mouth\r\nof the Rio Puruz, near the Cano Cuchivara, which is a western branch\r\nof the Puruz. These women therefore came from the banks of the Rio\r\nCayame, or Cayambe, consequently from the unknown country which\r\nextends south of the Maranon, between the Ucayale and the Madeira.\r\nRaleigh also places them on the south of the Maranon, but in the\r\nprovince of Topayos, and on the river of the same name. He says they\r\nwere rich in golden vessels, which they had acquired in exchange for\r\nthe famous green stones, or piedras hijadas. (Raleigh means, no doubt,\r\npiedros del higado, stones that cure diseases of the liver.) It is\r\nremarkable enough that, one hundred and forty-eight years after, La\r\nCondamine still found those green stones (divine stones), which differ\r\nneither in colour nor in hardness from oriental jade, in greater\r\nnumbers among the Indians who live near the mouth of the Rio Topayos,\r\nthan elsewhere. The Indians said that they inherited these stones,\r\nwhich cure the nephritic colic and epilepsy, from their fathers, who\r\nreceived them from the women without husbands.) A taste for the\r\nmarvellous, and a wish to invest the descriptions of the New Continent\r\nwith some of the colouring of classic antiquity, no doubt contributed\r\nto give great importance to the first narratives of Orellana. In\r\nperusing the works of Vespucci, Fernando Columbus, Geraldini, Oviedo,\r\nand Pietro Martyr, we recognize this tendency of the writers of the\r\nsixteenth century to find among the newly discovered nations all that\r\nthe Greeks have related to us of the first age of the world, and of\r\nthe manners of the barbarous Scythians and Africans. But if Oviedo, in\r\naddressing his letters to cardinal Bembo, thought fit to flatter the\r\ntaste of a man so familiar with the study of antiquity, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh had a less poetic aim. He sought to fix the attention of Queen\r\nElizabeth on the great empire of Guiana, the conquest of which he\r\nproposed. He gave a description of the rising of that gilded king (el\r\ndorado),* whose chamberlains, furnished with long tubes, blew powdered\r\ngold every morning over his body, after having rubbed it over with\r\naromatic oils: but nothing could be better adapted to strike the\r\nimagination of queen Elizabeth, than the warlike republic of women\r\nwithout husbands, who resisted the Castilian heroes. (* The term el\r\ndorado, which signifies the gilded, was not originally the name of the\r\ncountry. The territory subsequently distinguished by that appellation\r\nwas at first known as the country of el Rey Dorado, the Gilded King.)\r\nSuch were the motives which prompted exaggeration on the part of those\r\nwriters who have given most reputation to the Amazons of America; but\r\nthese motives do not, I think, suffice for entirely rejecting a\r\ntradition, which is spread among various nations having no\r\ncommunications one with another.\r\n\r\nThirty years after La Condamine visited Quito, a Portuguese\r\nastronomer, Ribeiro, who has traversed the Amazon, and the tributary\r\nstreams which run into that river on the northern side, has confirmed\r\non the spot all that the learned Frenchman had advanced. He found the\r\nsame traditions among the Indians; and he collected them with the\r\ngreater impartiality as he did not himself believe that the Amazons\r\nformed a separate horde. Not knowing any of the tongues spoken on the\r\nOrinoco and the Rio Negro, I could learn nothing certain respecting\r\nthe popular traditions of the women without husbands, or the origin of\r\nthe green stones, which are believed to be intimately connected with\r\nthem. I shall, however, quote a modern testimony of some weight, that\r\nof Father Gili. \"Upon inquiring,\" says this well-informed missionary,\r\n\"of a Quaqua Indian, what nations inhabited the Rio Cuchivero, he named\r\nto me the Achirigotos, the Pajuros, and the Aikeambenanos.* (* In\r\nItalian, Acchirecolti, Pajuri, and Aicheam-benano.) Being well\r\nacquainted,\" pursues he, \"with the Tamanac tongue, I instantly\r\ncomprehended the sense of this last word, which is a compound, and\r\nsignifies women living alone. The Indian confirmed my observation, and\r\nrelated that the Aikeambenanos were a community of women, who\r\nmanufactured blow-tubes* (* Long tubes made from a hollow cane, which\r\nthe natives use to propel their poisoned arrows.), and other weapons\r\nof war. They admit, once a year, the men of the neighbouring nation of\r\nVokearos into their society, and send them back with presents. All the\r\nmale children born in this horde of women are killed in their\r\ninfancy.\" This history seems framed on the traditions which circulate\r\namong the Indians of the Maranon, and among the Caribs; yet the Quaqua\r\nIndian, of whom Father Gili speaks, was ignorant of the Castilian\r\nlanguage; he had never had any communication with white men; and\r\ncertainly knew not, that south of the Orinoco there existed another\r\nriver, called the river of the Aikeambenanos, or Amazons.\r\n\r\nWhat must we conclude from this narration of the old missionary of\r\nEncaramada? Not that there are Amazons on the banks of the Cuchivero,\r\nbut that women in different parts of America, wearied of the state of\r\nslavery in which they were held by the men, united themselves\r\ntogether; that the desire of preserving their independence rendered\r\nthem warriors; and that they received visits from a neighbouring and\r\nfriendly horde. This society of women may have acquired some power in\r\none part of Guiana. The Caribs of the continent held intercourse with\r\nthose of the islands; and no doubt in this way the traditions of the\r\nMaranon and the Orinoco were propagated toward the north. Before the\r\nvoyage of Orellana, Christopher Columbus imagined he had found the\r\nAmazons in the Caribbee Islands. This great man was told, that the\r\nsmall island of Madanino (Montserrat) was inhabited by warlike women,\r\nwho lived the greater part of the year separate from men. At other\r\ntimes also, the conquistadores imagined that the women, who defended\r\ntheir huts in the absence of their husbands, were republics of\r\nAmazons; and, by an error less excusable, formed a like supposition\r\nrespecting the religious congregations, the convents of Mexican\r\nvirgins, who, far from admitting men at any season of the year into\r\ntheir society, lived according to the austere rule of Quetzalcohuatl.\r\nSuch was the disposition of men's minds, that in the long succession\r\nof travellers, who crowded on each other in their discoveries and in\r\nnarrations of the marvels of the New World, every one readily declared\r\nhe had seen what his predecessors had announced.\r\n\r\nWe passed three nights at San Carlos del Rio Negro. I count the\r\nnights, because I watched during the greater part of them, in the hope\r\nof seizing the moment of the passage of some star over the meridian.\r\nThat I might have nothing to reproach myself with, I kept the\r\ninstruments always ready for an observation. I could not even obtain\r\ndouble altitudes, to calculate the latitude by the method of Douwes.\r\nWhat a contrast between two parts of the same zone; between the sky of\r\nCumana, where the air is constantly pure as in Persia and Arabia, and\r\nthe sky of the Rio Negro, veiled like that of the Feroe islands,\r\nwithout sun, or moon or stars!\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, our canoe being ready before sunrise, we embarked\r\nto go up the Rio Negro as far as the mouth of the Cassiquiare, and to\r\ndevote ourselves to researches on the real course of that river, which\r\nunites the Orinoco to the Amazon. The morning was fine; but, in\r\nproportion as the heat augmented, the sky became obscured. The air is\r\nso saturated by water in these forests, that the vesicular vapours\r\nbecome visible on the least increase of evaporation at the surface of\r\nthe earth. The breeze being never felt, the humid strata are not\r\ndisplaced and renewed by dryer air. We were every day more grieved at\r\nthe aspect of the cloudy sky. M. Bonpland was losing by this excessive\r\nhumidity the plants he had collected; and I, for my part, was afraid\r\nlest I should again find the fogs of the Rio Negro in the valley of\r\nthe Cassiquiare. No one in these missions for half a century past had\r\ndoubted the existence of communication between two great systems of\r\nrivers; the important point of our voyage was confined therefore to\r\nfixing by astronomical observations the course of the Cassiquiare, and\r\nparticularly the point of its entrance into the Rio Negro, and that of\r\nthe bifurcation of the Orinoco. Without a sight of the sun and the\r\nstars this object would be frustrated, and we should have exposed\r\nourselves in vain to long and painful privations. Our fellow\r\ntravellers would have returned by the shortest way, that of the\r\nPimichin and the small rivers; but M. Bonpland preferred, like me,\r\npersisting in the plan of the voyage, which we had traced for\r\nourselves in passing the Great Cataracts. We had already travelled one\r\nhundred and eighty leagues in a boat from San Fernando de Apure to San\r\nCarlos, on the Rio Apure, the Orinoco, the Atabapo, the Temi, the\r\nTuamini, and the Rio Negro. In again entering the Orinoco by the\r\nCassiquiare we had to navigate three hundred and twenty leagues, from\r\nSan Carlos to Angostura. By this way we had to struggle against the\r\ncurrents during ten days; the rest was to be performed by going down\r\nthe stream of the Orinoco. It would have been blamable to have\r\nsuffered ourselves to be discouraged by the fear of a cloudy sky, and\r\nby the mosquitos of the Cassiquiare. Our Indian pilot, who had been\r\nrecently at Mandavaca, promised us the sun, and those great stars that\r\neat the clouds, as soon as we should have left the black waters of the\r\nGuaviare. We therefore carried out our first project of returning to\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo by the Cassiquiare; and, fortunately for our\r\nresearches, the prediction of the Indian was verified. The white\r\nwaters brought us by degrees a more serene sky, stars, mosquitos, and\r\ncrocodiles.\r\n\r\nWe passed between the islands of Zaruma and Mini, or Mibita, covered\r\nwith thick vegetation; and, after having ascended the rapids of the\r\nPiedra de Uinumane, we entered the Rio Cassiquiare at the distance of\r\neight miles from the small fort of San Carlos. The Piedra, or granitic\r\nrock which forms the little cataract, attracted our attention on\r\naccount of the numerous veins of quartz by which it is traversed.\r\nThese veins are several inches broad, and their masses proved that\r\ntheir date and formation are very different. I saw distinctly that,\r\nwherever they crossed each other, the veins containing mica and black\r\nschorl traversed and drove out of their direction those which\r\ncontained only white quartz and feldspar. According to the theory of\r\nWerner, the black veins were consequently of a more recent formation\r\nthan the white. Being a disciple of the school of Freyberg, I could\r\nnot but pause with satisfaction at the rock of Uinumane, to observe\r\nthe same phenomena near the equator, which I had so often seen in the\r\nmountains of my own country. I confess that the theory which considers\r\nveins as clefts filled from above with various substances, pleases me\r\nsomewhat less now than it did at that period; but these modes of\r\nintersection and driving aside, observed in the stony and metallic\r\nveins, do not the less merit the attention of travellers as being one\r\nof the most general and constant of geological phenomena. On the east\r\nof Javita, all along the Cassiquiare, and particularly in the\r\nmountains of Duida, the number of veins in the granite increases.\r\nThese veins are full of holes and druses; and their frequency seems to\r\nindicate that the granite of these countries is not of very ancient\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nWe found some lichens on the rock Uinumane, opposite the island of\r\nChamanare, at the edge of the rapids; and as the Cassiquiare near its\r\nmouth turns abruptly from east to south-west, we saw for the first\r\ntime this majestic branch of the Orinoco in all its breadth. It much\r\nresembles the Rio Negro in the general aspect of the landscape. The\r\ntrees of the forest, as in the basin of the latter river, advance as\r\nfar as the beach, and there form a thick coppice; but the Cassiquiare\r\nhas white waters, and more frequently changes its direction. Its\r\nbreadth, near the rapids of Uinumane, almost surpasses that of the Rio\r\nNegro. I found it everywhere from two hundred and fifty to two hundred\r\nand eighty toises, as far as above Vasiva. Before we passed the island\r\nof Garigave, we perceived to the north-east, almost at the horizon, a\r\nlittle hill with a hemispheric summit; the form which in every zone\r\ncharacterises mountains of granite. Continually surrounded by vast\r\nplains, the solitary rocks and hills excite the attention of the\r\ntraveller. Contiguous mountains are only found more to the east,\r\ntowards the sources of the Pacimoni, Siapa, and Mavaca. Having arrived\r\non the south of the Raudal of Caravine, we perceived that the\r\nCassiquiare, by the windings of its course, again approached San\r\nCarlos. The distance from this fort to the mission of San Francisco\r\nSolano, where we slept, is only two leagues and a half by land, but it\r\nis reckoned seven or eight by the river. I passed a part of the night\r\nin the open air, waiting vainly for stars. The air was misty,\r\nnotwithstanding the aguas blancas, which were to lead us beneath an\r\never-starry sky.\r\n\r\nThe mission of San Francisco Solano, situated on the left bank of the\r\nCassiquiare, was founded, as were most of the Christian settlements\r\nsouth of the Great Cataracts of the Orinoco, not by monks, but by\r\nmilitary authority. At the time of the expedition of the boundaries,\r\nvillages were built in proportion as a subteniente, or a corporal,\r\nadvanced with his troops. Part of the natives, in order to preserve\r\ntheir independence, retired without a struggle; others, of whom the\r\nmost powerful chiefs had been gained, joined the missions. Where there\r\nwas no church, they contented themselves with erecting a great cross\r\nof red wood, close to which they constructed a casa fuerte, or\r\nblock-house, the walls of which were formed of large beams resting\r\nhorizontally upon each other. This house had two stories; in the upper\r\nstory two cannon of small calibre were placed; and two soldiers lived\r\non the ground-floor, and were served by an Indian family. Those of the\r\nnatives with whom they were at peace cultivated spots of land round\r\nthe casa fuerte. The soldiers called them together by the sound of the\r\nhorn, or a botuto of baked earth, whenever any hostile attack was\r\ndreaded. Such were the pretended nineteen Christian settlements\r\nfounded by Don Antonio Santos in the way from Esmeralda to the\r\nErevato. Military posts, which had no influence on the civilization of\r\nthe natives, figured on the maps, and in the works of the\r\nmissionaries, as villages (pueblos) and reducciones apostolicas.* (*\r\nSignifying apostolic conquests or conversions.) The preponderance of\r\nthe military was maintained on the banks of the Orinoco till 1785,\r\nwhen the system of the monks of San Francisco began. The small number\r\nof missions founded, or rather re-established, since that period, owe\r\ntheir existence to the Fathers of the Observance; for the soldiers now\r\ndistributed among the missions are dependent on the missionaries, or\r\nat least are reputed to be so, according to the pretensions of the\r\necclesiastical hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Indians whom we found at San Francisco Solano were of two nations;\r\nPacimonales and Cheruvichahenas. The latter being descended from a\r\nconsiderable tribe settled on the Rio Tomo, near the Manivas of the\r\nUpper Guainia, I tried to gather from them some ideas respecting the\r\nupper course and the sources of the Rio Negro; but the interpreter\r\nwhom I employed could not make them comprehend my questions. Their\r\ncontinually-repeated answer was, that the sources of the Rio Negro and\r\nthe Inirida were as near to each other as \"two fingers of the hand.\"\r\nIn one of the huts of the Pacimonales we purchased two fine large\r\nbirds, a toucan (piapoco) and an ana, a species of macaw, seventeen\r\ninches long, having the whole body of a purple colour. We had already\r\nin our canoe seven parrots, two manakins (pipa), a motmot, two guans,\r\nor pavas de monte, two manaviris (cercoleptes or Viverra\r\ncaudivolvula), and eight monkeys, namely, two ateles,* (* Marimonda of\r\nthe Great Cataracts, Simia belzebuth, Brisson.) two titis,* (* Simia\r\nsciurea, the saimiri of Buffon.) one viudita,* (* Simia lugens.) two\r\ndouroucoulis or nocturnal monkeys,* (* Cusiensi, or Simia trivirgata.)\r\nand a short-tailed cacajao. (* Simia melanocephala, mono feo. These\r\nlast three species are new.) Father Zea whispered some complaints at\r\nthe daily augmentation of this ambulatory collection. The toucan\r\nresembles the raven in manners and intelligence. It is a courageous\r\nanimal, but easily tamed. Its long and stout beak serves to defend it\r\nat a distance. It makes itself master of the house, steals whatever it\r\ncan come at, and loves to bathe often and fish on the banks of the\r\nriver. The toucan we had bought was very young; yet it took delight,\r\nduring the whole voyage, in teasing the cusicusis, or nocturnal\r\nmonkeys, which are melancholy and irritable. I did not observe what\r\nhas been related in some works of natural history, that the toucan is\r\nforced, from the structure of its beak, to swallow its food by\r\nthrowing it up into the air. It raises it indeed with some difficulty\r\nfrom the ground, but, having once seized it with the point of its\r\nenormous beak, it has only to lift it up by throwing back its head,\r\nand holding it perpendicularly whilst in the act of swallowing. This\r\nbird makes extraordinary gestures when preparing to drink. The monks\r\nsay that it makes the sign of the cross upon the water; and this\r\npopular belief has obtained for the toucan, from the creoles, the\r\nsingular name of diostede.* (* Dios te de, God gives it thee.)\r\n\r\nMost of our animals were confined in small wicker cages; others ran at\r\nfull liberty in all parts of the boat. At the approach of rain the\r\nmacaws sent forth noisy cries, the toucan wanted to reach the shore to\r\nfish, and the little monkeys (the titis) went in search of Father Zea,\r\nto take shelter in the large sleeves of his Franciscan habit. These\r\nincidents sometimes amused us so much that we forgot the torment of\r\nthe mosquitos. At night we placed a leather case (petaca), containing\r\nour provisions, in the centre; then our instruments, and the cages of\r\nour animals; our hammocks were suspended around the cages, and beyond\r\nwere those of the Indians. The exterior circle was formed by the fires\r\nwhich are lighted to keep off the jaguars. Such was the order of our\r\nencampment on the banks of the Cassiquiare. The Indians often spoke to\r\nus of a little nocturnal animal, with a long nose, which surprises the\r\nyoung parrots in their nests, and in eating makes use of its hands\r\nlike the monkeys and the maniveris, or kinkajous. They call it the\r\nguachi; it is, no doubt, a coati, perhaps the Viverra nasua, which I\r\nsaw wild in Mexico. The missionaries gravely prohibit the natives from\r\neating the flesh of the guachi, to which, according to far-spread\r\nsuperstitious ideas, they attribute the same stimulating qualities\r\nwhich the people of the East believe to exist in the skink, and the\r\nAmericans in the flesh of the alligator.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of May, we left the mission of San Francisco Solano at a\r\nlate hour, to make but a short day's journey. The uniform stratum of\r\nvapours began to be divided into clouds with distinct outlines: and\r\nthere was a light east wind in the upper regions of the air. We\r\nrecognized in these signs an approaching change of the weather; and\r\nwere unwilling to go far from the mouth of the Cassiquiare, in the\r\nhope of observing during the following night the passage of some star\r\nover the meridian. We descried the Cano Daquiapo to the south, the\r\nGuachaparu to the north, and a few miles further, the rapids of\r\nCananivacari. The velocity of the current being 6.3 feet in a second,\r\nwe had to struggle against the turbulent waves of the Raudal. We went\r\non shore, and M. Bonpland discovered within a few steps of the beach a\r\nmajestic almendron, or Bertholletia excelsa. The Indians assured us,\r\nthat the existence of this valuable plant of the banks of the\r\nCassiquiare was unknown at San Francisco Solano, Vasiva, and\r\nEsmeralda. They did not think that the tree we saw, which was more\r\nthan sixty feet high, had been sown by some passing traveller.\r\nExperiments made at San Carlos have shown how rare it is to succeed in\r\ncausing the bertholletia to germinate, on account of its ligneous\r\npericarp, and the oil contained in its nut which so readily becomes\r\nrancid. Perhaps this tree denoted the existence of a forest of\r\nbertholletia in the inland country on the east and north-east. We\r\nknow, at least, with certainty, that this fine tree grows wild in the\r\nthird degree of latitude, in the Cerro de Guanaya. The plants that\r\nlive in society have seldom marked limits, and it happens, that before\r\nwe reach a palmar or a pinar,* (* Two Spanish words, which, according\r\nto a Latin form, denote a forest of palm-trees, palmetum, and of\r\npines, pinetum.) we find solitary palm-trees and pines. They are\r\nsomewhat like colonists that have advanced in the midst of a country\r\npeopled with different vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nFour miles distant from the rapids of Cunanivacari, rocks of the\r\nstrangest form rise in the plains. First appears a narrow wall eighty\r\nfeet high, and perpendicular; and at the southern extremity of this\r\nwall are two turrets, the courses of which are of granite, and nearly\r\nhorizontal. The grouping of the rocks of Guanari is so symmetrical\r\nthat they might be taken for the ruins of an ancient edifice. Are they\r\nthe remains of islets in the midst of an inland sea, that covered the\r\nflat ground between the Sierra Parime and the Parecis mountains?* (*\r\nThe Sierra de la Parime, or of the Upper Orinoco, and the Sierra (or\r\nCampos) dos Parecis, are part of the mountains of Matto Grosso, and\r\nform the northern back of the Sierra de Chiquitos. I here name the two\r\nchains of mountains running from east to west, and bordering the\r\nplains or basins of the Cassiquiare, the Rio Negro, and the Amazon,\r\nbetween 5 degrees 30 minutes north, and 14 degrees south latitude.) or\r\nhave these walls of rock, these turrets of granite, been upheaved by\r\nthe elastic forces that still act in the interior of our planet? We\r\nmay be permitted to meditate a little on the origin of mountains,\r\nafter having seen the position of the Mexican volcanoes, and of\r\ntrachyte summits on an elongated crevice; having found in the Andes of\r\nSouth America primitive and volcanic rocks in a straight line in the\r\nsame chain; and when we recollect the island, three miles in\r\ncircumference, and of a great height, which in modern times issued\r\nfrom the depths of the ocean near Oonalaska.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Cassiquiare are adorned with the chiriva palm-tree\r\nwith pinnate leaves, silvery on the under part. The rest of the forest\r\nfurnishes only trees with large, coriaceous, glossy leaves, that have\r\nplain edges. This peculiar physiognomy* of the vegetation of the\r\nGuainia, the Tuamini, and the Cassiquiare, is owing to the\r\npreponderance of the families of the guttiferae, the sapotae, and the\r\nlaurineae, in the equatorial regions. (* This physiognomy struck us\r\nforcibly, in the vast forests of Spanish Guiana, only between the\r\nsecond and third degrees of north latitude.) The serenity of the sky\r\npromising us a fine night, we resolved, at five in the evening, to\r\nrest near the Piedra de Culimacari, a solitary granite rock, like all\r\nthose which I have described between the Atabapo and the Cassiquiare.\r\nWe found by the bearings of the sinuosities of the river, that this\r\nrock is nearly in the latitude of the mission of San Francisco Solano.\r\nIn those desert countries, where man has hitherto left only fugitive\r\ntraces of his existence, I constantly endeavoured to make my\r\nobservations near the mouth of a river, or at the foot of a rock\r\ndistinguishable by its form. Such points only as are immutable by\r\ntheir nature can serve for the basis of geographical maps. I obtained,\r\nin the night of the 10th of May, a good observation of latitude by\r\nalpha of the Southern Cross; the longitude was determined, but with\r\nless precision, by the chronometer, taking the altitudes of the two\r\nbeautiful stars which shine in the feet of the Centaur. This\r\nobservation made known to us at the same time, with sufficient\r\nprecision for the purposes of geography, the positions of the mouth of\r\nthe Pacimoni, of the fortress of San Carlos, and of the junction of\r\nthe Cassiquiare with the Rio Negro. The rock of Culimacari is\r\nprecisely in latitude 2 degrees 0 minutes 42 seconds, and probably in\r\nlongitude 69 degrees 33 minutes 50 seconds.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with our observations, we left the rock of Culimacari at\r\nhalf past one on the morning of the 12th. The torment of mosquitos, to\r\nwhich we were exposed, augmented in proportion as we withdrew from the\r\nRio Negro. There are no zancudos in the valley of Cassiquiare, but the\r\nsimulia, and all the other insects of the tipulary family, are the\r\nmore numerous and venomous. Having still eight nights to pass in the\r\nopen air in this damp and unhealthy climate, before we could reach the\r\nmission of Esmeralda, our pilot sought to arrange our passage in such\r\na manner as might enable us to enjoy the hospitality of the missionary\r\nof Mandavaca, and some shelter in the village of Vasiva. We went up\r\nwith difficulty against the current, which was nine feet, and in some\r\nplaces (where I measured it with precision) eleven feet eight inches\r\nin a second, that is, almost eight miles an hour. Our resting-place\r\nwas probably not farther than three leagues in a right line from the\r\nmission of Mandavaca; yet, though we had no reason to complain of\r\ninactivity on the part of our rowers, we were fourteen hours in making\r\nthis short passage.\r\n\r\nTowards sunrise we passed the mouth of the Rio Pacimoni, a river which\r\nI mentioned when speaking of the trade in sarsaparilla, and which (by\r\nmeans of the Baria) intertwines in so remarkable a way with the\r\nCababuri. The Pacimoni rises in a hilly ground, from the confluence of\r\nthree small rivers,* not marked on the maps of the missionaries. (*\r\nThe Rios Guajavaca, Moreje, and Cachevaynery.) Its waters are black,\r\nbut less so than those of the lake of Vasiva, which also communicates\r\nwith the Cassiquiare. Between those two tributary streams coming from\r\nthe east, lies the mouth of the Rio Idapa, the waters of which are\r\nwhite. I shall not recur again to the difficulty of explaining this\r\ncoexistence of rivers differently coloured, within a small extent of\r\nterritory, but shall merely observe, that at the mouth of the\r\nPacimoni, and on the borders of the lake Vasiva, we were again struck\r\nwith the purity and extreme transparency of the brown waters. Ancient\r\nArabian travellers have observed, that the Alpine branch of the Nile,\r\nwhich joins the Bahr el Abiad near Halfaja, has green waters, which\r\nare so transparent, that the fish may be seen at the bottom of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nWe passed some turbulent rapids before we reached the mission of\r\nMandavaca. The village, which bears also the name of Quirabuena,\r\ncontains only sixty natives. The state of the Christian settlements is\r\nin general so miserable that, in the whole course of the Cassiquiare,\r\non a length of fifty leagues, not two hundred inhabitants are found.\r\nThe banks of this river were indeed more peopled before the arrival of\r\nthe missionaries; the Indians have withdrawn into the woods, toward\r\nthe east; for the western plains are almost deserted. The natives\r\nsubsist during a part of the year on those large ants of which I have\r\nspoken above. These insects are much esteemed here, as spiders are in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, where the savages of Australia deem them\r\ndelicious. We found at Mandavaca the good old missionary, who had\r\nalready spent twenty years of mosquitos in the bosques del\r\nCassiquiare, and whose legs were so spotted by the stings of insects,\r\nthat the colour of the skin could scarcely be perceived. He talked to\r\nus of his solitude, and of the sad necessity which often compelled him\r\nto leave the most atrocious crimes unpunished in the two missions of\r\nMandavaca and Vasiva. In the latter place, an Indian alcalde had, a\r\nfew years before, eaten one of his wives, after having taken her to\r\nhis conuco,* (* A hut surrounded with cultivated ground; a sort of\r\ncountry-house, which the natives prefer to residing in the missions.)\r\nand fattened her by good feeding. The cannibalism of the nations of\r\nGuiana is never caused by the want of subsistence, or by the\r\nsuperstitions of their religion, as in the islands of the South Sea;\r\nbut is generally the effect of the vengeance of a conqueror, and (as\r\nthe missionaries say) \"of a vitiated appetite.\" Victory over a hostile\r\ntribe is celebrated by a repast, in which some parts of the body of a\r\nprisoner are devoured. Sometimes a defenceless family is surprised in\r\nthe night; or an enemy, who is met with by chance in the woods, is\r\nkilled by a poisoned arrow. The body is cut to pieces, and carried as\r\na trophy to the hut. It is civilization only, that has made man feel\r\nthe unity of the human race; which has revealed to him, as we may say,\r\nthe ties of consanguinity, by which he is linked to beings to whose\r\nlanguage and manners he is a stranger. Savages know only their own\r\nfamily; and a tribe appears to them but a more numerous assemblage of\r\nrelations. When those who inhabit the missions see Indians of the\r\nforest, who are unknown to them, arrive, they make use of an\r\nexpression, which has struck us by its simple candour: they are, no\r\ndoubt, my relations; I understand them when they speak to me. But\r\nthese very savages detest all who are not of their family, or their\r\ntribe; and hunt the Indians of a neighbouring tribe, who live at war\r\nwith their own, as we hunt game. They know the duties of family ties\r\nand of relationship, but not those of humanity, which require the\r\nfeeling of a common tie with beings framed like ourselves. No emotion\r\nof pity prompts them to spare the wives or children of a hostile race;\r\nand the latter are devoured in preference, at the repast given at the\r\nconclusion of a battle or warlike incursion.\r\n\r\nThe hatred which savages for the most part feel for men who speak\r\nanother idiom, and appear to them to be of an inferior race, is\r\nsometimes rekindled in the missions, after having long slumbered. A\r\nshort time before our arrival at Esmeralda, an Indian, born in the\r\nforest* behind the Duida, travelled alone with another Indian, who,\r\nafter having been made prisoner by the Spaniards on the banks of the\r\nVentuario, lived peaceably in the village, or, as it is expressed\r\nhere, within the sound of the bell (debaxo de la campana.) (* En el\r\nmonte. The Indians born in the missions are distinguished from those\r\nborn in the woods. The word monte signifies more frequently, in the\r\ncolonies, a forest (bosque) than a mountain, and this circumstance has\r\nled to great errors in our maps, on which chains of mountains\r\n(sierras) are figured, where there are only thick forests, (monte\r\nespeso.)) The latter could only walk slowly, because he was suffering\r\nfrom one of those fevers to which the natives are subject, when they\r\narrive in the missions, and abruptly change their diet. Wearied by his\r\ndelay, his fellow-traveller killed him, and hid the body behind a\r\ncopse of thick trees, near Esmeralda. This crime, like many others\r\namong the Indians, would have remained unknown, if the murderer had\r\nnot made preparations for a feast on the following day. He tried to\r\ninduce his children, born in the mission and become Christians, to go\r\nwith him for some parts of the dead body. They had much difficulty in\r\npersuading him to desist from his purpose; and the soldier who was\r\nposted at Esmeralda, learned from the domestic squabble caused by this\r\nevent, what the Indians would have concealed from his knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is known that cannibalism and the practice of human sacrifices,\r\nwith which it is often connected, are found to exist in all parts of\r\nthe globe, and among people of very different races;* but what strikes\r\nus more in the study of history is to see human sacrifices retained in\r\na state of civilization somewhat advanced; and that the nations who\r\nhold it a point of honour to devour their prisoners are not always the\r\nrudest and most ferocious. (* Some casual instances of children\r\ncarried off by the negroes in the island of Cuba have led to the\r\nbelief, in the Spanish colonies, that there are tribes of cannibals in\r\nAfrica. This opinion, though supported by some travellers, is not\r\nborne out by the researches of Mr. Barrow on the interior of that\r\ncountry. Superstitious practices may have given rise to imputations\r\nperhaps as unjust as those of which Jewish families were the victims\r\nin the ages of intolerance and persecution.) The painful facts have\r\nnot escaped the observation of those missionaries who are sufficiently\r\nenlightened to reflect on the manners of the surrounding tribes. The\r\nCabres, the Guipunaves, and the Caribs, have always been more powerful\r\nand more civilized than the other hordes of the Orinoco; and yet the\r\ntwo former are as much addicted to anthropophagy as the latter are\r\nrepugnant to it. We must carefully distinguish the different branches\r\ninto which the great family of the Caribbee nations is divided. These\r\nbranches are as numerous as those of the Mongols, and the western\r\nTartars, or Turcomans. The Caribs of the continent, those who inhabit\r\nthe plains between the Lower Orinoco, the Rio Branco, the Essequibo,\r\nand the sources of the Oyapoc, hold in horror the practice of\r\ndevouring their enemies. This barbarous custom,* at the first\r\ndiscovery of America, existed only among the Caribs of the West\r\nIndies. (* See Geraldini Itinerarium page 186 and the eloquent tract\r\nof cardinal Bembo on the discoveries of Columbus. \"Insularum partem\r\nhomines incolebant feri trucesque, qui puerorum et virorum carnibus,\r\nquos aliis in insulus bello aut latrociniis cepissent, vescebantur; a\r\nfeminis abstinebant; Canibales appellati.\" \"Some of the islands are\r\ninhabited by a cruel and savage race, called cannibals, who eat the\r\nflesh of men and boys, and captives and slaves of the male sex,\r\nabstaining from that of females.\" Hist. Venet. 1551. The custom of\r\nsparing the lives of female prisoners confirms what I have previously\r\nsaid of the language of the women. Does the word cannibal, applied to\r\nthe Caribs of the West India Islands, belong to the language of this\r\narchipelago (that of Haiti)? or must we seek for it in an idiom of\r\nFlorida, which some traditions indicate as the first country of the\r\nCaribs?) It is they who have rendered the names of cannibals,\r\nCaribbees, and anthropophagi, synonymous; it was their cruelties that\r\nprompted the law promulgated in 1504, by which the Spaniards were\r\npermitted to make a slave of every individual of an American nation\r\nwhich could be proved to be of Caribbee origin. I believe, however,\r\nthat the anthropophagy of the inhabitants of the West India Islands\r\nwas much exaggerated by early travellers, whose stories Herrera, a\r\ngrave and judicious historian, has not disdained to repeat in his\r\nDecades historicas. He has even credited that extraordinary event\r\nwhich led the Caribs to renounce this barbarous custom. The natives of\r\na little island devoured a Dominican monk whom they had carried off\r\nfrom the coast of Porto Rico; they all fell sick, and would never\r\nagain eat monk or layman.\r\n\r\nIf the Caribs of the Orinoco, since the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, have differed in their manners from those of the West India\r\nIslands; if they are unjustly accused of anthropophagy; it is\r\ndifficult to attribute this difference to any superiority of their\r\nsocial state. The strangest contrasts are found blended in this\r\nmixture of nations, some of whom live only upon fish, monkeys, and\r\nants; while others are more or less cultivators of the ground, more or\r\nless occupied in making and painting pottery, or weaving hammocks or\r\ncotton cloth. Several of the latter tribes have preserved inhuman\r\ncustoms altogether unknown to the former. \"You cannot imagine,\" said\r\nthe old missionary of Mandavaca, \"the perversity of this Indian race\r\n(familia de Indios). You receive men of a new tribe into the village;\r\nthey appear to be mild, good, and laborious; but suffer them to take\r\npart in an incursion (entrada) to bring in the natives, and you can\r\nscarcely prevent them from murdering all they meet, and hiding some\r\nportions of the dead bodies.\" In reflecting on the manners of these\r\nIndians, we are almost horrified at that combination of sentiments\r\nwhich seem to exclude each other; that faculty of nations to become\r\nbut partially humanized; that preponderance of customs, prejudices,\r\nand traditions, over the natural affections of the heart. We had a\r\nfugitive Indian from the Guaisia in our canoe, who had become\r\nsufficiently civilized in a few weeks to be useful to us in placing\r\nthe instruments necessary for our observations at night. He was no\r\nless mild than intelligent, and we had some desire of taking him into\r\nour service. What was our horror when, talking to him by means of an\r\ninterpreter, we learned, that the flesh of the marimonde monkeys,\r\nthough blacker, appeared to him to have the taste of human flesh. He\r\ntold us that his relations (that is, the people of his tribe)\r\npreferred the inside of the hands in man, as in bears. This assertion\r\nwas accompanied with gestures of savage gratification. We inquired of\r\nthis young man, so calm and so affectionate in the little services\r\nwhich he rendered us, whether he still felt sometimes a desire to eat\r\nof a Cheruvichahena. He answered, without discomposure, that, living\r\nin the mission, he would only eat what he saw was eaten by the Padres.\r\nReproaches addressed to the natives on the abominable practice which\r\nwe here discuss, produce no effect; it is as if a Brahmin, travelling\r\nin Europe, were to reproach us with the habit of feeding on the flesh\r\nof animals. In the eyes of the Indian of the Guaisia, the\r\nCheruvichahena was a being entirely different from himself; and one\r\nwhom he thought it was no more unjust to kill than the jaguars of the\r\nforest. It was merely from a sense of propriety that, whilst he\r\nremained in the mission, he would only eat the same food as the\r\nFathers. The natives, if they return to their tribe (al monte), or\r\nfind themselves pressed by hunger, soon resume their old habits of\r\nanthropophagy. And why should we be so much astonished at this\r\ninconstancy in the tribes of the Orinoco, when we are reminded, by\r\nterrible and well-ascertained examples, of what has passed among\r\ncivilized nations in times of great scarcity? In Egypt, in the\r\nthirteenth century, the habit of eating human flesh pervaded all\r\nclasses of society; extraordinary snares were spread for physicians in\r\nparticular. They were called to attend persons who pretended to be\r\nsick, but who were only hungry; and it was not in order to be\r\nconsulted, but devoured. An historian of great veracity, Abd-allatif,\r\nhas related how a practice, which at first inspired dread and horror,\r\nsoon occasioned not even the slightest surprise.* (* \"When the poor\r\nbegan to eat human flesh, the horror and astonishment caused by\r\nrepasts so dreadful were such that these crimes furnished the\r\nnever-ceasing subject of every conversation. But at length the people\r\nbecame so accustomed to it, and conceived such a taste for this\r\ndetestable food, that people of wealth and respectability were found\r\nto use it as their ordinary food, to eat it by way of a treat, and\r\neven to lay in a stock of it. This flesh was prepared in different\r\nways, and the practice being once introduced, spread into the\r\nprovinces, so that instances of it were found in every part of Egypt.\r\nIt then no longer caused any surprise; the horror it had at first\r\ninspired vanished; and it was mentioned as an indifferent and ordinary\r\nthing. This mania of devouring one another became so common among the\r\npoor, that the greater part perished in this manner. These wretches\r\nemployed all sorts of artifices, to seize men by surprise, or decoy\r\nthem into their houses under false pretences. This happened to three\r\nphysicians among those who visited me; and a bookseller who sold me\r\nbooks, an old and very corpulent man, fell into their snares, and\r\nescaped with great difficulty. All the facts which we relate as\r\neye-witnesses fell under our observation accidentally, for we\r\ngenerally avoided witnessing spectacles which inspired us with so much\r\nhorror.\" Account of Egypt by Abd-allatif, physician of Bagdad,\r\ntranslated into French by De Sacy pages 360 to 374.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the Indians of the Cassiquiare readily return to their\r\nbarbarous habits, they evince, whilst in the missions, intelligence,\r\nsome love of labour, and, in particular, a great facility in learning\r\nthe Spanish language. The villages being, for the most part, inhabited\r\nby three or four tribes, who do not understand each other, a foreign\r\nidiom, which is at the same time that of the civil power, the language\r\nof the missionary, affords the advantage of more general means of\r\ncommunication. I heard a Poinave Indian conversing in Spanish with a\r\nGuahibo, though both had come from their forests within three months.\r\nThey uttered a phrase every quarter of an hour, prepared with\r\ndifficulty, and in which the gerund of the verb, no doubt according to\r\nthe grammatical turn of their own languages, was constantly employed.\r\n\"When I seeing Padre, Padre to me saying;\"* (* \"Quando io mirando\r\nPadre, Padre me diciendo.\") instead of, \"when I saw the missionary, he\r\nsaid to me.\" I have mentioned in another place, how wise it appeared\r\nto me in the Jesuits to generalize one of the languages of civilized\r\nAmerica, for instance that of the Peruvians,* (* The Quichua or Inca\r\nlanguage, Lengua del Inga.) and instruct the Indians in an idiom which\r\nis foreign to them in its roots, but not in its structure and\r\ngrammatical forms. This was following the system which the Incas, or\r\nking-priests of Peru had employed for ages, in order to humanize the\r\nbarbarous nations of the Upper Maranon, and maintain them under their\r\ndomination; a system somewhat more reasonable than that of making the\r\nnatives of America speak Latin, as was gravely proposed in a\r\nprovincial concilio at Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe were told that the Indians of the Cassiquiare and the Rio Negro are\r\npreferred on the Lower Orinoco, and especially at Angostura, to the\r\ninhabitants of the other missions, on account of their intelligence\r\nand activity. Those of Mandavaca are celebrated among the tribes of\r\ntheir own race for the preparation of the curare poison, which does\r\nnot yield in strength to the curare of Esmeralda. Unhappily the\r\nnatives devote themselves to this employment more than to agriculture.\r\nYet the soil on the banks of the Cassiquiare is excellent. We find\r\nthere a granitic sand, of a blackish-brown colour, which is covered in\r\nthe forests with thick layers of rich earth, and on the banks of the\r\nriver with clay almost impermeable to water. The soil of the\r\nCassiquiare appears more fertile than that of the valley of the Rio\r\nNegro, where maize does not prosper. Rice, beans, cotton, sugar, and\r\nindigo yield rich harvests, wherever their cultivation has been\r\ntried.* (* M. Bonpland found at Mandavaca, in the huts of the natives,\r\na plant with tuberous roots, exactly like cassava (yucca). It is\r\ncalled cumapana, and is cooked by being baked on the ashes. It grows\r\nspontaneously on the banks of the Cassiquiare.) We saw wild indigo\r\naround the missions of San Miguel de Davipe, San Carlos, and\r\nMandavaca. No doubt can exist that several nations of America,\r\nparticularly the Mexicans, long before the conquest, employed real\r\nindigo in their hieroglyphic paintings; and that small cakes of this\r\nsubstance were sold at the great market of Tenochtitlan. But a\r\ncolouring matter, chemically identical, may be extracted from plants\r\nbelonging to neighbouring genera; and I should not at present venture\r\nto affirm that the native indigoferae of America do not furnish some\r\ngeneric difference from the Indigofera anil, and the Indigofera\r\nargentea of the Old World. In the coffee-trees of both hemispheres\r\nthis difference has been observed.\r\n\r\nHere, as at the Rio Negro, the humidity of the air, and the consequent\r\nabundance of insects, are obstacles almost invincible to new\r\ncultivation. Everywhere you meet with those large ants that march in\r\nclose bands, and direct their attacks the more readily on cultivated\r\nplants, because they are herbaceous and succulent, whilst the forests\r\nof these countries afford only plants with woody stalks. If a\r\nmissionary wishes to cultivate salad, or any culinary plant of Europe,\r\nhe is compelled as it were to suspend his garden in the air. He fills\r\nan old boat with good mould, and, having sown the seed, suspends it\r\nfour feet above the ground with cords of the chiquichiqui palm-tree;\r\nbut most frequently places it on a slight scaffolding. This protects\r\nthe young plants from weeds, worms, and those ants which pursue their\r\nmigration in a right line, and, not knowing what vegetates above them,\r\nseldom turn from their course to climb up stakes that are stripped of\r\ntheir bark. I mention this circumstance to prove how difficult, within\r\nthe tropics, on the banks of great rivers, are the first attempts of\r\nman to appropriate to himself a little spot of earth in that vast\r\ndomain of nature, invaded by animals, and covered by spontaneous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 13th of May, I obtained some observations of\r\nthe stars, unfortunately the last at the Cassiquiare. The latitude of\r\nMandavaca is 2 degrees 4 minutes 7 seconds; its longitude, according\r\nto the chronometer, 69 degrees 27 minutes. I found the magnetic dip\r\n25.25 degrees (cent div), showing that it had increased considerably\r\nfrom the fort of San Carlos. Yet the surrounding rocks are of the same\r\ngranite, mixed with a little hornblende, which we had found at Javita,\r\nand which assumes a syenitic aspect. We left Mandavaca at half-past\r\ntwo in the morning. After six hours' voyage, we passed on the east the\r\nmouth of the Idapa, or Siapa, which rises on the mountain of Uuturan,\r\nand furnishes near its sources a portage to the Rio Mavaca, one of the\r\ntributary streams of the Orinoco. This river has white waters, and is\r\nnot more than half as broad as the Pacimoni, the waters of which are\r\nblack. Its upper course has been strangely misrepresented on maps. I\r\nshall have occasion hereafter to mention the hypotheses that have\r\ngiven rise to these errors, in speaking of the source of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nWe stopped near the raudal of Cunuri. The noise of the little cataract\r\naugmented sensibly during the night, and our Indians asserted that it\r\nwas a certain presage of rain. I recollected that the mountaineers of\r\nthe Alps have great confidence in the same prognostic.* (* \"It is\r\ngoing to rain, because we hear the murmur of the torrents nearer,\" say\r\nthe mountaineers of the Alps, like those of the Andes. The cause of\r\nthe phenomenon is a modification of the atmosphere, which has an\r\ninfluence at once on the sonorous and on the luminous undulations. The\r\nprognostic drawn from the increase and the intensity of sound is\r\nintimately connected with the prognostic drawn from a less extinction\r\nof light. The mountaineers predict a change of weather, when, the air\r\nbeing calm, the Alps covered with perpetual snow seem on a sudden to\r\nbe nearer the observer, and their outlines are marked with great\r\ndistinctness on the azure sky. What is it that causes the want of\r\nhomogeneity in the vertical strata of the atmosphere to disappear\r\ninstantaneously?) It fell before sunrise, and the araguato monkeys had\r\nwarned us, by their lengthened howlings, of the approaching rain, long\r\nbefore the noise of the cataract increased.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, the mosquitos, and especially the ants, drove us from the\r\nshore before two in the morning. We had hitherto been of opinion that\r\nthe ants did not crawl along the cords by which the hammocks are\r\nusually suspended: whether we were correct in this supposition, or\r\nwhether the ants fell on us from the tops of the trees, I cannot say;\r\nbut certain it is that we had great difficulty to keep ourselves free\r\nfrom these troublesome insects. The river became narrower as we\r\nadvanced, and the banks were so marshy, that it was not without much\r\nlabour M. Bonpland could get to a Carolinea princeps loaded with large\r\npurple flowers. This tree is the most beautiful ornament of these\r\nforests, and of those of the Rio Negro. We examined repeatedly, during\r\nthis day, the temperature of the Cassiquiare. The water at the surface\r\nof the river was only 24 degrees (when the air was at 25.6 degrees.)\r\nThis is nearly the temperature of the Rio Negro, but four or five\r\ndegrees below that of the Orinoco. After having passed on the west the\r\nmouth of the Cano Caterico, which has black waters of extraordinary\r\ntransparency, we left the bed of the river, to land at an island on\r\nwhich the mission of Vasiva is established. The lake which surrounds\r\nthis mission is a league broad, and communicates by three outlets with\r\nthe Cassiquiare. The surrounding country abounds in marshes which\r\ngenerate fever. The lake, the waters of which appear yellow by\r\ntransmitted light, is dry in the season of great heat, and the Indians\r\nthemselves are unable to resist the miasmata rising from the mud. The\r\ncomplete absence of wind contributes to render the climate of this\r\ncountry more pernicious.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th to the 21st of May we slept constantly in the open air;\r\nbut I cannot indicate the spots where we halted. These regions are so\r\nwild, and so little frequented, that with the exception of a few\r\nrivers, the Indians were ignorant of the names of all the objects\r\nwhich I set by the compass. No observation of a star helped me to fix\r\nthe latitude within the space of a degree. After having passed the\r\npoint where the Itinivini separates from the Cassiquiare, to take its\r\ncourse to the west towards the granitic hills of Daripabo, we found\r\nthe marshy banks of the river covered with bamboos. These arborescent\r\ngramina rise to the height of twenty feet; their stem is constantly\r\narched towards the summit. It is a new species of Bambusa with very\r\nbroad leaves. M. Bonpland fortunately found one in flower; a\r\ncircumstance I mention, because the genera Nastus and Bambusa had\r\nbefore been very imperfectly distinguished, and nothing is more rare\r\nin the New World, than to see these gigantic gramina in flower. N.\r\nMutis herborised during twenty years in a country where the Bambusa\r\nguadua forms marshy forests several leagues broad, without having ever\r\nbeen able to procure the flowers. We sent that learned naturalist the\r\nfirst ears of Bambusa from the temperate valleys of Popayan. It is\r\nstrange that the parts of fructification should develop themselves so\r\nrarely in a plant which is indigenous, and which vegetates with such\r\nextraordinary rigour, from the level of the sea to the height of nine\r\nhundred toises, that is, to a subalpine region the climate of which,\r\nbetween the tropics, resembles that of the south of Spain. The Bambusa\r\nlatifolia seems to be peculiar to the basins of the Upper Orinoco, the\r\nCassiquiare, and the Amazon; it is a social plant, like all the\r\ngramina of the family of the nastoides; but in that part of Spanish\r\nGuiana which we traversed it does not grow in those large masses which\r\nthe Spanish Americans call guadales, or forests of bamboos.\r\n\r\nOur first resting-place above Vasiva was easily arranged. We found a\r\nlittle nook of dry ground, free from shrubs, to the south of the Cano\r\nCuramuni, in a spot where we saw some capuchin monkeys.* (* Simia\r\nchiropotes.) They were recognizable by their black beards and their\r\ngloomy and sullen air, and were walking slowly on the horizontal\r\nbranches of a genipa. During the five following nights our passage was\r\nthe more troublesome in proportion as we approached the bifurcation of\r\nthe Orinoco. The luxuriance of the vegetation increases in a manner of\r\nwhich it is difficult even for those acquainted with the aspect of the\r\nforests between the tropics, to form an idea. There is no longer a\r\nbank: a palisade of tufted trees forms the margin of the river. You\r\nsee a canal two hundred toises broad, bordered by two enormous walls,\r\nclothed with lianas and foliage. We often tried to land, but without\r\nsuccess. Towards sunset we sailed along for an hour seeking to\r\ndiscover, not an opening (since none exists), but a spot less wooded,\r\nwhere our Indians by means of the hatchet and manual labour, could\r\nclear space enough for a resting-place for twelve or thirteen persons.\r\nIt was impossible to pass the night in the canoe; the mosquitos, which\r\ntormented us during the day, accumulated toward evening beneath the\r\ntoldo covered with palm-leaves, which served to shelter us from the\r\nrain. Our hands and faces had never before been so much swelled.\r\nFather Zea, who had till then boasted of having in his missions of the\r\ncataracts the largest and fiercest (las mas feroces) mosquitos, at\r\nlength gradually acknowledged that the sting of the insects of the\r\nCassiquiare was the most painful he had ever felt. We experienced\r\ngreat difficulty, amid a thick forest, in finding wood to make a fire,\r\nthe branches of the trees in those equatorial regions where it always\r\nrains, being so full of sap, that they will scarcely burn. There being\r\nno bare shore, it is hardly possible to procure old wood, which the\r\nIndians call wood baked in the sun. However, fire was necessary to us\r\nonly as a defence against the beasts of the forest; for we had such a\r\nscarcity of provision that we had little need of fuel for the purpose\r\nof preparing our food.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, towards evening, we discovered a spot where wild\r\ncacao-trees were growing on the bank of the river. The nut of these\r\ncacaos is small and bitter; the Indians of the forest suck the pulp,\r\nand throw away the nut, which is picked up by the Indians of the\r\nmissions, and sold to persons who are not very nice in the preparation\r\nof their chocolate. \"This is the Puerto del Cacao\" (Cacao Port), said\r\nthe pilot; \"it is here our Padres sleep, when they go to Esmeralda to\r\nbuy sarbacans* (* The bamboo tubes furnished by the Arundinaria, used\r\nfor projecting the poisoned arrows of the natives. See Views of Nature\r\npage 180.) and juvias ( Brazil nuts). Not five boats, however, pass\r\nannually by the Cassiquiare; and since we left Maypures (a whole month\r\npreviously), we had not met one living soul on the rivers we\r\nnavigated, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the missions. To\r\nthe south of lake Duractumuni we slept in a forest of palm-trees. It\r\nrained violently, but the pothoses, arums, and lianas, furnished so\r\nthick a natural trellis, that we were sheltered as under a vault of\r\nfoliage. The Indians whose hammocks were placed on the edge of the\r\nriver, interwove the heliconias and other musaceae, so as to form a\r\nkind of roof over them. Our fires lighted up, to the height of fifty\r\nor sixty feet, the palm-trees, the lianas loaded with flowers, and the\r\ncolumns of white smoke, which ascended in a straight line toward the\r\nsky. The whole exhibited a magnificent spectacle; but to have enjoyed\r\nit fully, we should have breathed an air clear of insects.\r\n\r\nThe most depressing of all physical sufferings are those which are\r\nuniform in their duration, and can be combated only by long patience.\r\nIt is probable, that in the exhalations of the forests of the\r\nCassiquiare M. Bonpland imbibed the seeds of a severe malady, under\r\nwhich he nearly sunk on our arrival at Angostura. Happily for him and\r\nfor me, nothing led us to presage the danger with which he was\r\nmenaced. The view of the river, and the hum of the insects, were a\r\nlittle monotonous; but some remains of our natural cheerfulness\r\nenabled us to find sources of relief during our wearisome passage. We\r\ndiscovered, that by eating small portions of dry cacao ground without\r\nsugar, and drinking a large quantity of the river water, we succeeded\r\nin appeasing our appetite for several hours. The ants and the\r\nmosquitos troubled us more than the humidity and the want of food.\r\nNotwithstanding the privations to which we were exposed during our\r\nexcursions in the Cordilleras, the navigation from Mandavaca to\r\nEsmeralda has always appeared to us the most painful part of our\r\ntravels in America. I advise those who are not very desirous of seeing\r\nthe great bifurcation of the Orinoco, to take the way of the Atabapo\r\nin preference to that of the Cassiquiare.\r\n\r\nAbove the Cano Duractumuni, the Cassiquiare pursues a uniform\r\ndirection from north-east to south-west. We were surprised to see how\r\nmuch the high steep banks of the Cassiquiare had been undermined on\r\neach side by the sudden risings of the water. Uprooted trees formed as\r\nit were natural rafts; and being half-buried in the mud, they were\r\nextremely dangerous for canoes. We passed the night of the 20th of\r\nMay, the last of our passage on the Cassiquiare, near the point of the\r\nbifurcation of the Orinoco. We had some hope of being able to make an\r\nastronomical observation, as falling-stars of remarkable magnitude\r\nwere visible through the vapours that veiled the sky; whence we\r\nconcluded that the stratum of vapours must be very thin, since meteors\r\nof this kind have scarcely ever been seen below a cloud. Those we now\r\nbeheld shot towards the north, and succeeded each other at almost\r\nequal intervals. The Indians, who seldom ennoble by their expressions\r\nthe wanderings of the imagination, name the falling-stars the urine;\r\nand the dew the spittle of the stars. The clouds thickened anew, and\r\nwe discerned neither the meteors, nor the real stars, for which we had\r\nimpatiently waited during several days.\r\n\r\nWe had been told, that we should find the insects at Esmeralda still\r\nmore cruel and voracious than in the branch of the Orinoco which we\r\nwere going up; nevertheless we indulged the hope of at length sleeping\r\nin a spot that was inhabited, and of taking some exercise in\r\nherbalizing. This anticipation was, however, disturbed at our last\r\nresting-place on the Cassiquiare. Whilst we were sleeping on the edge\r\nof the forest, we were warned by the Indians, in the middle of the\r\nnight, that they heard very near us the cries of a jaguar. These\r\ncries, they alleged, came from the top of some neighbouring trees.\r\nSuch is the thickness of the forests in these regions, that scarcely\r\nany animals are to be found there but such as climb trees; as, for\r\ninstance, the monkeys, animals of the weasel tribe, jaguars, and other\r\nspecies of the genus Felis.\r\n\r\nAs our fires burnt brightly, we paid little attention to the cries of\r\nthe jaguars. They had been attracted by the smell and noise of our\r\ndog. This animal (which was of the mastiff breed) began at first to\r\nbark; and when the tiger drew nearer, to howl, hiding himself below\r\nour hammocks. how great was our grief, when in the morning, at the\r\nmoment of re-embarking, the Indians informed us that the dog had\r\ndisappeared! There could be no doubt that it had been carried off by\r\nthe jaguars.* (* See Views of Nature page 195.) Perhaps, when their\r\ncries had ceased, it had wandered from the fires on the side of the\r\nbeach; and possibly we had not heard its moans, as we were in a\r\nprofound sleep. We have often heard the inhabitants of the banks of\r\nthe Orinoco and the Rio Magdalena affirm, that the oldest jaguars will\r\ncarry off animals from the midst of a halting-place, cunningly\r\ngrasping them by the neck so as to prevent their cries. We waited part\r\nof the morning, in the hope that our dog had only strayed. Three days\r\nafter we came back to the same place; we heard again the cries of the\r\njaguars, for these animals have a predilection for particular spots;\r\nbut all our search was vain. The dog, which had accompanied us from\r\nCaracas, and had so often in swimming escaped the pursuit of the\r\ncrocodiles,* had been devoured in the forest. (* Ibid page 198.)\r\n\r\nOn the 21st May, we again entered the bed of the Orinoco, three\r\nleagues below the mission of Esmeralda. It was now a month since we\r\nhad left that river near the mouth of the Guaviare. We had still to\r\nproceed seven hundred and fifty miles* (* Of nine hundred and fifty\r\ntoises each, or two hundred and fifty nautical leagues.) before\r\nreaching Angostura, but we should go with the stream; and this\r\nconsideration lessened our discouragement. In descending great rivers,\r\nthe rowers take the middle of the current, where there are few\r\nmosquitos; but in ascending, they are obliged, in order to avail\r\nthemselves of the dead waters and counter-currents, to sail near the\r\nshore, where the proximity of the forests, and the remains of organic\r\nsubstances accumulated on the beach, harbour the tipulary insects. The\r\npoint of the celebrated bifurcation of the Orinoco has a very imposing\r\naspect. Lofty granitic mountains rise on the northern bank; and amidst\r\nthem are discovered at a distance the Maraguaca and the Duida. There\r\nare no mountains on the left bank of the Orinoco, west or east of the\r\nbifurcation, till opposite the mouth of the Tamatama. On that spot\r\nstands the rock Guaraco, which is said to throw out flames from time\r\nto time in the rainy season. When the Orinoco is no longer bounded by\r\nmountains towards the south, and when it reaches the opening of a\r\nvalley, or rather a depression of the ground, which terminates at the\r\nRio Negro, it divides itself into two branches. The principal branch\r\n(the Rio Paragua of the Indians) continues its course west-north-west,\r\nturning round the group of the mountains of Parime; the other branch\r\nforming the communication with the Amazon runs into plains, the\r\ngeneral slope of which is southward, but of which the partial planes\r\nincline, in the Cassiquiare, to south-west, and in the basin of the\r\nRio Negro, south-east. A phenomenon so strange in appearance, which I\r\nverified on the spot, merits particular attention; the more especially\r\nas it may throw some light on analogous facts, which are supposed to\r\nhave been observed in the interior of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a communication of the Orinoco with the Amazon by the\r\nRio Negro, and a bifurcation of the Caqueta, was believed by Sanson,\r\nand rejected by Father Fritz and by Blaeuw: it was marked in the first\r\nmaps of De l'Isle, but abandoned by that celebrated geographer towards\r\nthe end of his days. Those who had mistaken the mode of this\r\ncommunication hastened to deny the communication itself. It is in fact\r\nwell worthy of remark that, at the time when the Portuguese went up\r\nmost frequently by the Amazon, the Rio Negro, and the Cassiquiare, and\r\nwhen Father Gumilla's letters were carried (by the natural\r\ninterbranching of the rivers) from the lower Orinoco to Grand Para,\r\nthat very missionary made every effort to spread the opinion through\r\nEurope that the basins of the Orinoco and the Amazon are perfectly\r\nseparate. He asserts that, having several times gone up the former of\r\nthese rivers as far as the Raudal of Tabaje, situate in the latitude\r\nof 1 degree 4 minutes, he never saw a river flow in or out that could\r\nbe taken for the Rio Negro. He adds further, that a great Cordillera,\r\nwhich stretches from east to west, prevents the mingling of the\r\nwaters, and renders all discussion on the supposed communication of\r\nthe two rivers useless. The errors of Father Gumilla arose from his\r\nfirm persuasion that he had reached the parallel of 1 degree 4 minutes\r\non the Orinoco. He was in error by more than 5 degrees 10 minutes of\r\nlatitude; for I found, by observation, at the mission of Atures,\r\nthirteen leagues south of the rapids of Tabaje, the latitude to be 5\r\ndegrees 37 minutes 34 seconds. Gumilla having gone but little above\r\nthe confluence of the Meta, it is not surprising that he had no\r\nknowledge of the bifurcation of the Orinoco, which is found by the\r\nsinuosities of the river to be one hundred and twenty leagues distant\r\nfrom the Raudal of Tabaje.\r\n\r\nLa Condamine, during his memorable navigation on the river Amazon in\r\n1743, carefully collected a great number of proofs of this\r\ncommunication of the rivers, denied by the Spanish Jesuit. The most\r\ndecisive proof then appeared to him to be the unsuspected testimony of\r\na Cauriacani Indian woman with whom he had conversed, and who had come\r\nin a boat from the banks of the Orinoco (from the mission of Pararuma)\r\nto Grand Para. Before the return of La Condamine to his own country,\r\nthe voyage of Father Manuel Roman, and the fortuitous meeting of the\r\nmissionaries of the Orinoco and the Amazon, left no doubt of this\r\nfact, the knowledge of which was first obtained by Acunha.\r\n\r\nThe incursions undertaken from the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nto procure slaves, had gradually led the Portuguese from the Rio\r\nNegro, by the Cassiquiare, to the bed of a great river, which they did\r\nnot know to be the Upper Orinoco. A flying camp, composed of the troop\r\nof ransomers,* favoured this inhuman commerce. (* Tropa de rescate;\r\nfrom rescatar, to redeem.) After having excited the natives to make\r\nwar, they ransomed the prisoners; and, to give an appearance of equity\r\nto the traffic, monks accompanied the troop of ransomers to examine\r\nwhether those who sold the slaves had a right to do so, by having made\r\nthem prisoners in open war. From the year 1737 these visits of the\r\nPortuguese to the Upper Orinoco became very frequent. The desire of\r\nexchanging slaves (poitos) for hatchets, fish-hooks, and glass\r\ntrinkets, induced the Indian tribes to make war upon one another. The\r\nGuipunaves, led on by their valiant and cruel chief Macapu, descended\r\nfrom the banks of the Inirida towards the confluence of the Atabapo\r\nand the Orinoco. \"They sold,\" says the missionary Gili, \"the slaves\r\nwhom they did not eat.\"* (* \"I Guipunavi avventizj abitatori dell'\r\nAlto Orinoco, recavan de' danni incredibili alle vicine mansuete\r\nnazioni; altre mangiondone, altre conducendone schiave ne' Portoghesi\r\ndominj.\" \"The Guipunaves, at their first arrival on the Upper Orinoco,\r\ninflicted incredible injuries on the other peaceable tribes who dwelt\r\nnear them, devouring some, and selling others as slaves to the\r\nPortuguese.\" Gili tome 1 page 31.) The Jesuits of the Lower Orinoco\r\nbecame uneasy at this state of things, and the superior of the Spanish\r\nmissions, Father Roman, the intimate friend of Gumilla, took the\r\ncourageous resolution of crossing the Great Cataracts, and visiting\r\nthe Guipunaves, without being escorted by Spanish soldiers. He left\r\nCarichana the 4th of February, 1744; and having arrived at the\r\nconfluence of the Guaviare, the Atabapo, and the Orinoco, where the\r\nlast mentioned river suddenly changes its previous course from east to\r\nwest, to a direction from south to north, he saw from afar a canoe as\r\nlarge as his own, and filled with men in European dresses. He caused a\r\ncrucifix to be placed at the bow of his boat in sign of peace,\r\naccording to the custom of the missionaries when they navigate in a\r\ncountry unknown to them. The whites, who were Portuguese slave-traders\r\nof the Rio Negro, recognized with marks of joy the habit of the order\r\nof St. Ignatius. They heard with astonishment that the river on which\r\nthis meeting took place was the Orinoco; and they brought Father Roman\r\nby the Cassiquiare to the Brazilian settlements on the Rio Negro. The\r\nsuperior of the Spanish missions was forced to remain near the flying\r\ncamp of the troop of ransomers till the arrival of the Portuguese\r\nJesuit Avogadri, who had gone upon business to Grand Para. Father\r\nManuel Roman returned with his Salive Indians by the same way, that of\r\nthe Cassiquiare and the Upper Orinoco, to Pararuma,* a little to the\r\nnorth of Carichana, after an absence of seven months. (* On the 15th\r\nof October, 1774. La Condamine quitted the town of Grand Para December\r\nthe 29th, 1743; it follows, from a comparison of the dates, that the\r\nIndian woman of Pararuma, carried off by the Portuguese, and to whom\r\nthe French traveller had spoken, had not come with Father Roman, as\r\nwas erroneously affirmed. The appearance of this woman on the banks of\r\nthe Amazon is interesting with respect to the researches lately made\r\non the mixture of races and languages: it proves the enormous\r\ndistances through which the individuals of one tribe are compelled to\r\ncarry on intercourse with those of another.) He was the first white\r\nman who went from the Rio Negro, consequently from the basin of the\r\nAmazon, without passing his boats over any portage, to the basin of\r\nthe Lower Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of this extraordinary passage spread with such rapidity\r\nthat La Condamine was able to announce it* at a public sitting of the\r\nAcademy, seven months after the return of Father Roman to Pararuma. (*\r\nThe intelligence was communicated to him by Father John Ferreyro,\r\nrector of the college of Jesuits at Para. Voyage a l'Amazone page 120.\r\nMem. de l'Acad. 1745 page 450. Caulin page 79. See also, in the work\r\nof Gili, the fifth chapter of the first book, published in 1780, with\r\nthe title: Della scoperta delle communicazione dell' Orinoco col\r\nMaragnone.) \"The communication between the Orinoco and the Amazon,\"\r\nsaid he, \"recently averred, may pass so much the more for a discovery\r\nin geography, as, although the junction of these two rivers is marked\r\non the old maps (according to the information given by Acunha), it had\r\nbeen suppressed by all the modern geographers in their new maps, as if\r\nin concert. This is not the first time that what is positive fact has\r\nbeen thought fabulous, that the spirit of criticism has been pushed\r\ntoo far, and that this communication has been treated as chimerical by\r\nthose who ought to have been better informed.\" Since the voyage of\r\nFather Roman in 1774, no person in Spanish Guiana, or on the coasts of\r\nCumana and Caracas, has admitted a doubt of the existence of the\r\nCassiquiare and the bifurcation of the Orinoco. Father Gumilla\r\nhimself; whom Bouguer met at Carthagena, confessed that he had been\r\ndeceived; and he read to Father Gili, a short time before his death, a\r\nsupplement to his history of the Orinoco, intended for a new edition,\r\nin which he recounts pleasantly the manner in which he had been\r\nundeceived. The expedition of the boundaries, under Iturriaga and\r\nSolano, completed in detail the knowledge of the geography of the\r\nUpper Orinoco, and the intertwinings of this river with the Rio Negro.\r\nSolano established himself in 1756 at the confluence of the Atabapo;\r\nand from that time the Spanish and Portuguese commissioners often\r\npassed in their canoes, by the Cassiquiare, from the Lower Orinoco to\r\nthe Rio Negro, to visit each other at their head-quarters of Cabruta*\r\nand Mariva. (* General Iturriaga, confined by illness, first at\r\nMuitaco, or Real Corona, and afterward at Cabruta, received a visit in\r\n1760 from the Portuguese colonel Don Gabriel de Souza y Figueira, who\r\ncame from Grand Para, having made a voyage of nearly nine hundred\r\nleagues in his boat. The Swedish botanist, Loefling, who was chosen to\r\naccompany the expedition of the boundaries at the expense of the\r\nSpanish government, so greatly multiplied in his ardent imagination\r\nthe branchings of the great rivers of South America, that he appeared\r\nwell persuaded of being able to navigate, by the Rio Negro and the\r\nAmazon, to the Rio de la Plata. (Iter page 131.)) Since the year 1767,\r\ntwo or three canoes come annually from the fort of San Carlos, by the\r\nbifurcation of the Orinoco to Angostura, to fetch salt and the pay of\r\nthe troops. These passages, from one basin of a river to another, by\r\nthe natural canal of the Cassiquiare, excite no more attention in the\r\ncolonists at present than the arrival of boats that descend the Loire\r\nby the canal of Orleans, awakens on the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\nAlthough, since the journey of Father Roman, in 1744, precise notions\r\nhave been acquired in the Spanish possessions in America, both of the\r\ndirection of the Upper Orinoco from east to west, and of the manner of\r\nits communication with the Rio Negro, this knowledge did not reach\r\nEurope till a much later period. In 1750, La Condamine and D'Anville*\r\nwere still of opinion that the Orinoco was a branch of the Caqueta\r\ncoming from the south-east, and that the Rio Negro issued immediately\r\nfrom it. (* See the classical memoir of this great geographer in the\r\nJournal des Savans, March 1750 page 184. \"One fact,\" says D'Anville,\r\n\"which cannot be considered as equivocal, after the proofs with which\r\nwe have been recently furnished, is the communication of the Rio Negro\r\nwith the Orinoco; but we must not hesitate to admit, that we are not\r\nyet sufficiently informed of the manner in which this communication\r\ntakes place.\" I was surprised to see in a very rare map, which I found\r\nat Rome (Provincia Quitensis Soc. Jesu in America, auctore Carolo\r\nBrentano et Nicolao de la Torre; Romae 1745) that seven years after\r\nthe discovery of Father Roman, the Jesuits of Quito were ignorant of\r\nthe existence of the Cassiquiare. The Rio Negro is figured in this map\r\nas a branch of the Orinoco.) It was only in the second edition of his\r\nSouth America, that D'Anville (without renouncing that\r\nintercommunication of the Caqueta, by means of the Iniricha (Inirida),\r\nwith the Orinoco and the Rio Negro) describes the Orinoco as taking\r\nits rise at the east, near the sources of the Rio Branco, and marks\r\nthe Rio Cassiquiare as bearing the waters of the Upper Orinoco to the\r\nRio Negro. It is probable that this indefatigable and learned writer\r\nhad obtained information on the manner of the bifurcation from his\r\nfrequent communications with the missionaries,* who were then the only\r\ngeographers of the most inland parts of the continents. (* According\r\nto the Annals of Berredo, it would appear, that as early as the year\r\n1739, the military incursions from the Rio Negro to the Cassiquiare\r\nhad confirmed the Portuguese Jesuits in the opinion that there was a\r\ncommunication between the Amazon and the Orinoco. Southey's Brazils\r\nvolume 1 page 658.)\r\n\r\nHad the nations of the lower region of equinoctial America\r\nparticipated in the civilization spread over the cold and alpine\r\nregion, that immense Mesopotamia between the Orinoco and the Amazon\r\nwould have favoured the development of their industry, animated their\r\ncommerce, and accelerated the progress of social order. We see\r\neverywhere in the old world the influence of locality on the dawning\r\ncivilization of nations. The island of Meroe between the Astaboras and\r\nthe Nile, the Punjab of the Indus, the Douab of the Ganges, and the\r\nMesopotamia of the Euphrates, furnish examples that are justly\r\ncelebrated in the annals of the human race. But the feeble tribes that\r\nwander in the savannahs and the woods of eastern America, have\r\nprofited little by the advantages of their soil, and the\r\ninterbranchings of their rivers. The distant incursions of the Caribs,\r\nwho went up the Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro, to carry\r\noff slaves and exercise pillage, compelled some rude tribes to rouse\r\nthemselves from their indolence, and form associations for their\r\ncommon defence; the little good, however, which these wars with the\r\nCaribs (the Bedouins of the rivers of Guiana) produced, was but slight\r\ncompensation for the evils that followed in their train, by rendering\r\nthe tribes more ferocious, and diminishing their population. We cannot\r\ndoubt, that the physical aspect of Greece, intersected by small chains\r\nof mountains, and mediterranean gulfs, contributed, at the dawn of\r\ncivilization, to the intellectual development of the Greeks. But the\r\noperation of this influence of climate, and of the configuration of\r\nthe soil, is felt in all its force only among a race of men who,\r\nendowed with a happy organization of the mental faculties, are\r\nsusceptible of exterior impulse. In studying the history of our\r\nspecies, we see, at certain distances, these foci of ancient\r\ncivilization dispersed over the globe like luminous points; and we are\r\nstruck by the inequality of improvement in nations inhabiting\r\nanalogous climates, and whose native soil appears equally favoured by\r\nthe most precious gifts of nature.\r\n\r\nSince my departure from the banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon, a new\r\nera has unfolded itself in the social state of the nations of the\r\nWest. The fury of civil discussions has been succeeded by the\r\nblessings of peace, and a freer development of the arts of industry.\r\nThe bifurcations of the Orinoco, the isthmus of Tuamini, so easy to be\r\nmade passable by an artificial canal, will ere long fix the attention\r\nof commercial Europe. The Cassiquiare, as broad as the Rhine, and the\r\ncourse of which is one hundred and eighty miles in length, will no\r\nlonger form uselessly a navigable canal between two basins of rivers\r\nwhich have a surface of one hundred and ninety thousand square\r\nleagues. The grain of New Grenada will be carried to the banks of the\r\nRio Negro; boats will descend from the sources of the Napo and the\r\nUcuyabe, from the Andes of Quito and of Upper Peru, to the mouths of\r\nthe Orinoco, a distance which equals that from Timbuctoo to\r\nMarseilles. A country nine or ten times larger than Spain, and\r\nenriched with the most varied productions, is navigable in every\r\ndirection by the medium of the natural canal of the Cassiquiare, and\r\nthe bifurcation of the rivers. This phenomenon, which will one day be\r\nso important for the political connections of nations, unquestionably\r\ndeserves to be carefully examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.24.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER ORINOCO, FROM THE ESMERALDA TO THE CONFLUENCE OF THE\r\nGUAVIARE.\r\nSECOND PASSAGE ACROSS THE CATARACTS OF ATURES AND MAYPURES.\r\nTHE LOWER ORINOCO, BETWEEN THE MOUTH OF THE RIO APURE, AND ANGOSTURA\r\nTHE CAPITAL OF SPANISH GUIANA.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the point where the Orinoco forms its bifurcation, the\r\ngranitic group of Duida rises in an amphitheatre on the right bank of\r\nthe river. This mountain, which the missionaries call a volcano, is\r\nnearly eight thousand feet high. It is perpendicular on the south and\r\nwest, and has an aspect of solemn grandeur. Its summit is bare and\r\nstony, but, wherever its less steep declivities are covered with mould\r\nvast forests appear suspended on its flanks. At the foot of Duida is\r\nthe mission of Esmeralda, a little hamlet with eighty inhabitants,\r\nsurrounded by a lovely plain, intersected by rills of black but limpid\r\nwater. This plain is adorned with clumps of the mauritia palm, the\r\nsago-tree of America. Nearer the mountain, the distance of which from\r\nthe cross of the mission I found to be seven thousand three hundred\r\ntoises, the marshy plain changes to a savannah, and spends itself\r\nalong the lower region of the Cordillera. Large pine-apples are there\r\nfound of a delicious flavour; that species of bromelia always grows\r\nsolitary among the gramina, like our Colchicum autumnale, while the B.\r\nkaratas, another species of the same genus, is a social plant, like\r\nour whortleberries and heaths. The pine-apples of Esmeralda are\r\ncultivated throughout Guiana. There are certain spots in America, as\r\nin Europe, where different fruits attain their highest perfection. The\r\nsapota-plum (achra) should be eaten at the Island of Margareta or at\r\nCumana: the chirimoya (very different from the custard-apple and\r\nsweet-sop of the West India Islands) at Loxa in Peru; the grenadilla,\r\nor parcha, at Caracas; and the pine-apple at Esmeralda, or in the\r\nisland of Cuba. The pine-apple forms the ornament of the fields near\r\nthe Havannah, where it is planted in parallel rows; on the sides of\r\nthe Duida it embellishes the turf of the savannahs, lifting its yellow\r\nfruit, crowned with a tuft of silvery leaves, above the setaria, the\r\npaspalum, and a few cyperaceae. This plant, which the Indians of the\r\nOrinoco call ana-curua, has been propagated since the sixteenth\r\ncentury in the interior of China,* and some English travellers found\r\nit recently, together with other plants indubitably American (maize,\r\ncassava, tobacco, and pimento), on the banks of the River Congo, in\r\nAfrica. (* No doubt remains of the American origin of the Bromelia\r\nananas. See Cayley's Life of Raleigh volume 1 page 61. Gili volume 1\r\npages 210 and 336. Robert Brown, Geogr. Observ. on the Plants of the\r\nRiver Congo 1818 page 50.)\r\n\r\nThere is no missionary at Esmeralda; the monk appointed to celebrate\r\nmass in that hamlet is settled at Santa Barbara, more than fifty\r\nleagues distant; and he visits this spot but five or six times in a\r\nyear. We were cordially received by an old officer, who took us for\r\nCatalonian shopkeepers, and who supposed that trade had led to the\r\nmissions. On seeing packages of paper intended for drying our plants,\r\nhe smiled at our simple ignorance. \"You come,\" said he, \"to a country\r\nwhere this kind of merchandise has no sale; we write little here; and\r\nthe dried leaves of maize, the platano (plantain-tree), and the vijaho\r\n(heliconia), serve us, like paper in Europe, to wrap up needles,\r\nfish-hooks, and other little articles of which we are careful.\" This\r\nold officer united in his person the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority. He taught the children, I will not say the Catechism, but\r\nthe Rosary; he rang the bells to amuse himself; and impelled by ardent\r\nzeal for the service of the church, he sometimes used his chorister's\r\nwand in a manner not very agreeable to the natives.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the small extent of the mission, three Indian\r\nlanguages are spoken at Esmeralda; the Idapimanare, the Catarapenno,\r\nand the Maquiritan. The last of these prevails on the Upper Orinoco,\r\nfrom the confluence of the Ventuari as far as that of the Padamo (*\r\nThe Arivirianos of the banks of the Ventuari speak a dialect of the\r\nlanguage of the Maquiritares. The latter live, jointly with a tribe of\r\nthe Macos, in the savannahs that are by the Padamo. They are so\r\nnumerous, that they have even given their name to this tributary\r\nstream of the Orinoco.); the Caribbee prevails on the Lower Orinoco;\r\nthe Ottomac, near the confluence of the Apure, at the Great Cataracts;\r\nand the Maravitan, on the banks of the Rio Negro. These are the five\r\nor six languages most generally spoken. We were surprised to find at\r\nEsmeralda many zambos, mulattos, and copper-coloured people, who\r\ncalled themselves Spaniards (Espanoles) and who fancy they are white,\r\nbecause they are not so red as the Indians. These people live in the\r\nmost absolute misery; they have for the most part been sent hither in\r\nbanishment (desterrados). Solano, in his haste to found colonies in\r\nthe interior of the country, in order to guard its entrance against\r\nthe Portuguese, assembled in the Llanos, and as far as the island of\r\nMargareta, vagabonds and malefactors, whom justice had vainly pursued,\r\nand made them go up the Orinoco to join the unhappy Indians who had\r\nbeen carried off from the woods. A mineralogical error gave celebrity\r\nto Esmeralda. The granites of Duida and Maraguaca contain in open\r\nveins fine rock-crystals, some of them of great transparency, others\r\ncoloured by chlorite or blended with actonite; these were mistaken for\r\ndiamonds and emeralds.\r\n\r\nSo near the sources of the Orinoco we heard of nothing in these\r\nmountains but the proximity of El Dorado, the lake Parima, and the\r\nruins of the great city of Manoa. A man, still known in the country\r\nfor his credulity and his love of exaggeration, Don Apollinario Diez\r\nde la Fuente, assumed the pompous title of capitan poblador, and cabo\r\nmilitar (military commander) of the fort of Cassiquiare. This fort\r\nconsisted of a few trunks of trees, joined together by planks; and to\r\ncomplete the deception, a demand was made at Madrid for the privileges\r\nof a villa for the mission of Esmeralda, which but a hamlet with\r\ntwelve or fifteen huts. A colony composed of elements altogether\r\nheterogeneous perished by degrees. The vagabonds of the Llanos had as\r\nlittle taste for labour as the natives, who were compelled to live\r\nwithin the sound of the bell. The former found a motive in their pride\r\nto justify their indolence. In the missions, every mulatto who is not\r\ndecidedly black as an African, or copper-coloured as an Indian, calls\r\nhimself a Spaniard; he belongs to the gente de razon--the race endued\r\nwith reason; and that reason (sometimes, it must be admitted, arrogant\r\nand indolent) persuaded the whites, and those who fancy they are so,\r\nthat to till the ground is a task fit only for slaves (poitos) and the\r\nnative neophytes. The colony of Esmeralda had been founded on the\r\nprinciples of that of Australia; but it was far from being governed\r\nwith the same wisdom. The American colonists, being separated from\r\ntheir native soil, not by seas, but by forests and savannahs,\r\ndispersed; some taking the road northward, towards the Caura and the\r\nCarony; others proceeding southward to the Portuguese possessions.\r\nThus the celebrity of this villa, and of the emerald-mines of Duida,\r\nvanished in a few years; and Esmeralda, on account of the immense\r\nnumber of insects that obscure the air at all seasons of the year, was\r\nregarded by the monks as a place of banishment. The superior of the\r\nmissions, when he would make the lay-brothers mindful of their duty,\r\nthreatens sometimes to send them to Esmeralda; that is, say the monks,\r\nto be condemned to the mosquitos; to be devoured by those buzzing\r\nflies (zancudos gritones) which God appears to have created for the\r\ntorment and chastisement of man.* (* \"Estos mosquitos que llaman\r\nzancudos gritones los parece cria la naturaleza para castigo y\r\ntormento de los hombres.\" \"Those mosquitos which are called buzzing\r\nzancudos, Nature seems to have created for the especial punishment and\r\ntorture of man.\" Fray Pedro Simon.) These strange punishments have not\r\nalways been confined to the lay-brothers. There happened in 1788 one\r\nof those monastic revolutions, of which it is difficult to form a\r\nconception in Europe, according to the ideas that prevail of the\r\npeaceful state of the Christian settlements in the New World. For a\r\nlong period the Franciscan monks settled in Guiana had been desirous\r\nof forming a separate republic, and rendering themselves independent\r\nof the college of Piritu at Nueva Barcelona. Discontented with the\r\nelection of Fray Gutierez de Aguilera, chosen by a general chapter,\r\nand confirmed by the king in the important office of president of the\r\nmissions, five or six monks of the Upper Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and\r\nthe Rio Negro, assembled together at San Fernando de Atabapo; chose\r\nhastily a new superior from their own body; and caused the old one,\r\nwho, unfortunately for himself, had come to visit those parts, to be\r\narrested. They put him in irons, threw him into a boat, and conducted\r\nhim to Esmeralda, as to a place of proscription. This great distance\r\nof the coast from the scene of this revolution led the monks to hope\r\nthat their crime would remain long unknown beyond the Great Cataracts.\r\nThey wished to gain time to intrigue, to negotiate, to frame acts of\r\naccusation, and employ the little artifices by which, in every\r\ncountry, the invalidity of a first election may be proved. Fray\r\nGutierez do Aguilera languished in his prison at Esmeralda, and fell\r\ndangerously ill from the double influence of the excessive heat, and\r\nthe continual irritation of the mosquitos. Happily for the fallen\r\npower the monks did not remain united. A missionary of the Cassiquiare\r\nconceived serious alarms respecting the issue of this affair; he\r\ndreaded being sent a prisoner to Cadiz, or, as they say in the\r\ncolonies, having his name on the list (baxo partido de registro). Fear\r\novercame his resolution, and he suddenly disappeared. Indians were\r\nplaced on the watch at the mouth of the Atabapo, at the Great\r\nCataracts, and wherever the fugitive was likely to pass on his way to\r\nthe Lower Orinoco. Notwithstanding these precautions, he arrived at\r\nAngostura, and then reached the college of the missions of Piritu,\r\ndenounced his colleagues, and was appointed, in recompense of this\r\ninformation, to arrest those with whom he had conspired against the\r\npresident of the missions.* (* Two of the missionaries, considered as\r\nthe leaders of the insurrection, were embarked at Angostura, in order\r\nto be tried in Spain. The vessel in which they were conveyed became\r\nleaky, and put into Spanish Harbour in the island of Trinidad. The\r\ngovernor Chacon intereated himself in the fate of the monks; they were\r\npardoned a violent proceeding somewhat inconsistent with monastic\r\ndiscipline, and were again employed in the missions. I was acquainted\r\nwith them both during my abode in South America.) At Esmeralda, where\r\nthe political events that have agitated Europe for thirty years past\r\nhave not yet been heard of, lively interest is still felt in an event\r\nwhich is called the sedition of the monks, (el alboroto de los\r\nfrailes.) In this country, as in the East, no conception is formed of\r\nany other revolutions than those that are made by rulers themselves;\r\nand we have just seen that the effects are not very alarming.\r\n\r\nIf the villa of Esmeralda, with a population of twelve or fifteen\r\nfamilies, be at present considered as a frightful place of abode, this\r\nmust be attributed to the want of cultivation, the distance from every\r\nother inhabited country, and the excessive quantity of mosquitos. The\r\nsite of the mission is highly picturesque; the surrounding country is\r\nlovely, and of great fertility. I never saw plantains of so large a\r\nsize as these: and indigo, sugar, and cacao might be produced in\r\nabundance, if any trouble were taken for their cultivation. The Cerro\r\nDuida is surrounded with fine pasturage; and if the Observantins of\r\nthe college of Piritu partook a little of the industry of the\r\nCatalonian Capuchins settled on the banks of the Carony, numerous\r\nherds would be seen wandering between the Cunucunumo and the Padamo.\r\nAt present, not a cow or a horse is to be found; and the inhabitants,\r\nvictims of their own indolence, are often reduced to eat the flesh of\r\nalouate monkeys, and flour made from the bones of fish, of which I\r\nshall have occasion to speak hereafter. A little cassava and a few\r\nplantains only are cultivated; and when the fishery is not abundant,\r\nthe natives of a country so favoured by nature are exposed to the most\r\ncruel privations.\r\n\r\nThe pilots of the small number of boats that go from the Rio Negro to\r\nAngostura by the Cassiquiare are afraid to ascend as far as Esmeralda,\r\nand therefore that mission would have been much better placed at the\r\npoint of the bifurcation of the Orinoco. It is probable that this vast\r\ncountry will not always be doomed to the desertion in which it has\r\nhitherto been left, owing to the errors of monkish administration and\r\nthe spirit of monopoly that characterises corporations. We may even\r\npredict on what points of the Orinoco industry and commerce will\r\nbecome most active. In every zone, population is concentred at the\r\nmouth of tributary streams. The Rio Apure, by which the productions of\r\nthe provinces of Varinas and Merida are exported, will give great\r\nimportance to the little town of Cabruta, which will then be in\r\nrivalship with San Fernando de Apure, where all commerce has hitherto\r\ncentred. Higher up, a new settlement will be formed at the confluence\r\nof the Meta, which communicates with New Grenada by the Llanos of\r\nCasanare. The two missions of the Cataracts will increase, from the\r\nactivity to which the transport of boats at those points will give\r\nrise; for an unhealthy and damp climate, and the swarming of\r\nmosquitos, will as little impede the progress of cultivation at the\r\nOrinoco as at the Rio Magdalena, whenever a powerful mercantile\r\ninterest shall call new settlers thither. Habitual evils are those\r\nwhich are least felt; and men born in America do not suffer the same\r\nintensity of pain as Europeans recently arrived. Perhaps, also, the\r\ndestruction of forests round the inhabited places, although slow, will\r\nsomewhat tend to diminish the torment of the tipulary insects. San\r\nFernando de Atabapo, Javita, San Carlos, and Esmeralda, appear (from\r\ntheir situation at the mouth of the Guaviare, the portage between\r\nTuamini and the Rio Negro, the confluence of the Cassiquiare, and the\r\npoint of bifurcation of the Upper Orinoco) to promise a considerable\r\nincrease of population and prosperity. The same improvement will take\r\nplace in the fertile but uncultivated countries through which flow the\r\nGuallaga, the Amazon, and the Orinoco; as well as at the isthmus of\r\nPanama, the lake of Nicaragua, and the Rio Huasacualco, which furnish\r\na communication between the two oceans. The imperfection of political\r\ninstitutions may for ages have converted into deserts places where the\r\ncommerce of the world should be found concentred; but the time\r\napproaches when these obstacles shall exist no longer. A vicious\r\nadministration cannot always struggle against the united interest of\r\nmen; and civilization will be carried insensibly into those countries,\r\nthe great destinies of which nature itself proclaims, by the physical\r\nconfiguration of the soil, the immense windings of the rivers, and the\r\nproximity of two seas, that bathe the shores of Europe and of India.\r\n\r\nEsmeralda is the most celebrated spot on the Orinoco for the\r\npreparation of that active poison, which is employed in war, in the\r\nchase, and, singularly enough, as a remedy for gastric derangements.\r\nThe poison of the ticunas of the Amazon, the upas-tieute of Java, and\r\nthe curare of Guiana, are the most deleterious substances that are\r\nknown. Raleigh, about the end of the sixteenth century, had heard of\r\nurari* as being a vegetable substance with which arrows were envenomed\r\n(* In Tamanac marana, in Maypure macuri.); yet no fixed notions of\r\nthis poison had reached Europe. The missionaries Gumilla and Gili had\r\nnot been able to penetrate into the country where the curare is\r\nmanufactured. Gumilla asserts that this preparation was enveloped in\r\ngreat mystery; that its principal ingredient was furnished by a\r\nsubterranean plant with a tuberous root, which never puts forth\r\nleaves, and which is called specially the root (raiz de si misma);\r\nthat the venomous exhalations which arise from the manufacture are\r\nfatal to the lives of the old women who (being otherwise useless) are\r\nchosen to watch over this operation; finally, that these vegetable\r\njuices are never thought to be sufficiently concentrated till a few\r\ndrops produce at a distance a repulsive action on the blood. An Indian\r\nwounds himself slightly; and a dart dipped in the liquid curare is\r\nheld near the wound. If it make the blood return to the vessels\r\nwithout having been brought into contact with them, the poison is\r\njudged to be sufficiently concentrated.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Esmeralda, the greater part of the Indians were\r\nreturning from an excursion which they had made to the east, beyond\r\nthe Rio Padamo, to gather juvias, or the fruit of the bertholletia,\r\nand the liana which yields the curare. Their return was celebrated by\r\na festival, which is called in the mission la fiesta de las juvias,\r\nand which resembles our harvest-homes and vintage-feasts. The women\r\nhad prepared a quantity of fermented liquor; and during two days the\r\nIndians were in a state of intoxication. Among nations who attach\r\ngreat importance to the fruit of the palm, and of some other trees\r\nuseful for the nourishment of man, the period when these fruits are\r\ngathered is marked by public rejoicings, and time is divided according\r\nto these festivals, which succeed one another in a course invariably\r\nregular. We were fortunate enough to find an old Indian more temperate\r\nthan the rest, who was employed in preparing the curare poison from\r\nfreshly-gathered plants. He was the chemist of the place. We found at\r\nhis dwelling large earthen pots for boiling the vegetable juice,\r\nshallower vessels to favour the evaporation by a larger surface, and\r\nleaves of the plantain-tree rolled up in the shape of our filters, and\r\nused to filtrate the liquids, more or less loaded with fibrous matter.\r\nThe greatest order and neatness prevailed in this hut, which was\r\ntransformed into a chemical laboratory. The old Indian was known\r\nthroughout the mission by the name of the poison-master (amo del\r\ncurare). He had that self-sufficient air and tone of pedantry of which\r\nthe pharmacopolists of Europe were formerly accused. \"I know,\" said\r\nhe, \"that the whites have the secret of making soap, and manufacturing\r\nthat black powder which has the defect of making a noise when used in\r\nkilling animals. The curare, which we prepare from father to son, is\r\nsuperior to anything you can make down yonder (beyond sea). It is the\r\njuice of an herb which kills silently, without any one knowing whence\r\nthe stroke comes.\"\r\n\r\nThis chemical operation, to which the old man attached so much\r\nimportance, appeared to us extremely simple. The liana (bejuco) used\r\nat Esmeralda for the preparation of the poison, bears the same name as\r\nin the forests of Javita. It is the bejuco de Mavacure, which is\r\ngathered in abundance east of the mission, on the left bank of the\r\nOrinoco, beyond the Rio Amaguaca, in the mountainous and rocky tracts\r\nof Guanaya and Yumariquin. Although the bundles of bejuco which we\r\nfound in the hut of the Indian were entirely bare of leaves, we had no\r\ndoubt of their being produced by the same plant of the strychnos\r\nfamily (nearly allied to the rouhamon of Aublet) which we had examined\r\nin the forest of Pimichin.* (* I may here insert the description of\r\nthe curare or bejuco de Mavacure, taken from a manuscript, yet\r\nunpublished, of my learned fellow-labourer M. Kunth, corresponding\r\nmember of the Institute. \"Ramuli lignosi, oppositi, ramulo altero\r\nabortivo, teretiusculi, fuscescenti-tomentosi, inter petiolos lineola\r\npilosa notati, gemmula aut processu filiformi (pedunculo?) terminati.\r\nFOLIA opposita, bereviter petiolata, ovato-oblonga, acuminata,\r\nintergerrima, reticulato-triplinervia, nervo medio subtus prominente,\r\nmembranacea, ciliata, utrinque glabra, nervo medio\r\nfuscescente-tomentoso, lacte viridia, subtus pallidiora, 1 1/2 to 2\r\n1/2 pollices longa, 8 to 9 lineas lata. PETIOLI lineam longi,\r\ntomentosi, inarticulati.\") The mavacure is employed fresh or dried\r\nindifferently during several weeks. The juice of the liana, when it\r\nhas been recently gathered, is not regarded as poisonous; possibly it\r\nis so only when strongly concentrated. It is the bark and a part of\r\nthe alburnum which contain this terrible poison. Branches of the\r\nmavacure four or five lines in diameter are scraped with a knife, and\r\nthe bark that comes off is bruised, and reduced into very thin\r\nfilaments on the stone employed for grinding cassava. The venomous\r\njuice being yellow, the whole fibrous mass takes that colour. It is\r\nthrown into a funnel nine inches high, with an opening four inches\r\nwide. This funnel was of all the instruments of the Indian laboratory\r\nthat of which the poison-master seemed to be most proud. He asked us\r\nrepeatedly if, por alla (out yonder, meaning in Europe) we had ever\r\nseen anything to be compared to this funnel (embudo). It was a leaf of\r\nthe plantain-tree rolled up in the form of a cone, and placed within\r\nanother stronger cone made of the leaves of the palm-tree. The whole\r\nof this apparatus was supported by slight frame-work made of the\r\npetioles and ribs of palm-leaves. A cold infusion is first prepared by\r\npouring water on the fibrous matter which is the ground bark of the\r\nmavacure. A yellowish water filters during several hours, drop by\r\ndrop, through the leafy funnel. This filtered water is the poisonous\r\nliquor, but it acquires strength only when concentrated by\r\nevaporation, like molasses, in a large earthen pot. The Indian from\r\ntime to time invited us to taste the liquid; its taste, more or less\r\nbitter, decides when the concentration by fire has been carried\r\nsufficiently far. There is no danger in tasting it, the curare being\r\ndeleterious only when it comes into immediate contact with the blood.\r\nThe vapours, therefore, which are disengaged from the pans are not\r\nhurtful, notwithstanding all that has been asserted on this point by\r\nthe missionaries of the Orinoco. Fontana, in his experiments on the\r\npoison of the ticuna of the Amazon, long since proved that the vapours\r\narising from this poison, when thrown on burning charcoal, may be\r\ninhaled without danger and that the statement of La Condamine, that\r\nIndian women, when condemned to death, have been killed by the vapours\r\nof the poison of the ticuna, is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe most concentrated juice of the mavacure is not thick enough to\r\nstick to the darts; and therefore, to give a body to the poison,\r\nanother vegetable juice, extremely glutinous, drawn from a tree with\r\nlarge leaves, called kiracaguero, is poured into the concentrated\r\ninfusion. As this tree grows at a great distance from Esmeralda, and\r\nwas at that period as destitute of flowers and fruits as the bejuco de\r\nmavacure, we could not determine it botanically. I have several times\r\nmentioned that kind of fatality which withholds the most interesting\r\nplants from the examination of travellers, while thousands of others,\r\nof the chemical properties of which we are ignorant, are found loaded\r\nwith flowers and fruits. In travelling rapidly, even within the\r\ntropics, where the flowering of the ligneous plants is of such long\r\nduration, scarcely one-eighth of the trees can be seen furnishing the\r\nessential parts of fructification. The chances of being able to\r\ndetermine, I do not say the family, but the genus and species, is\r\nconsequently as one to eight; and it may be conceived that this\r\nunfavourable chance is felt most powerfully when it deprives us of the\r\nintimate knowledge of objects which afford a higher interest than that\r\nof descriptive botany.\r\n\r\nAt the instant when the glutinous juice of the kiracaguero-tree is\r\npoured into the venomous liquor well concentrated, and kept in a state\r\nof ebullition, it blackens, and coagulates into a mass of the\r\nconsistence of tar, or of a thick syrup. This mass is the curare of\r\ncommerce. When we hear the Indians say that the kiracaguero is as\r\nnecessary as the bejuco do mavacure in the manufacture of the poison,\r\nwe may be led into error by the supposition that the former also\r\ncontains some deleterious principle, while it only serves (as the\r\nalgarrobo, or any other gummy substance would do) to give more body to\r\nthe concentrated juice of the curare. The change of colour which the\r\nmixture undergoes is owing to the decomposition of a hydruret of\r\ncarbon; the hydrogen is burned, and the carbon is set free. The curare\r\nis sold in little calabashes; but its preparation being in the hands\r\nof a few families, and the quantity of poison attached to each dart\r\nbeing extremely small, the best curare, that of Esmeralda and\r\nMandavaca, is sold at a very high price. This substance, when dried,\r\nresembles opium; but it strongly absorbs moisture when exposed to the\r\nair. Its taste is an agreeable bitter, and M. Bonpland and myself have\r\noften swallowed small portions of it. There is no danger in so doing,\r\nif it be certain that neither lips nor gums bleed. In experiments made\r\nby Mangili on the venom of the viper, one of his assistants swallowed\r\nall the poison that could be extracted from four large vipers of\r\nItaly, without being affected by it. The Indians consider the curare,\r\ntaken internally, as an excellent stomachic. The same poison prepared\r\nby the Piraoas and Salives, though it has some celebrity, is not so\r\nmuch esteemed as that of Esmeralda. The process of this preparation\r\nappears to be everywhere nearly the same; but there is no proof that\r\nthe different poisons sold by the same name at the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazon are identical, and derived from the same plants. Orfila,\r\ntherefore, in his excellent work On Poisons, has very judiciously\r\nseparated the wourali of Dutch Guiana, the curare of the Orinoco, the\r\nticuna of the Amazon, and all those substances which have been too\r\nvaguely united under the name of American poisons. Possibly at some\r\nfuture day, one and the same alkaline principle, similar to morphine\r\nand strychnia, will be found in poisonous plants belonging to\r\ndifferent genera.\r\n\r\nAt the Orinoco the curare de raiz (of the root) is distinguished from\r\nthe curare de bejuco (of lianas, or of the bark of branches). We saw\r\nonly the latter prepared; the former is weaker, and much less\r\nesteemed. At the river Amazon we learned to distinguish the poisons of\r\nthe Ticuna, Yagua, Peva, and Xibaro Indians, which being all obtained\r\nfrom the same plant, perhaps differ only by a more or less careful\r\npreparation. The Ticuna poison, to which La Condamine has given so\r\nmuch celebrity in Europe, and which somewhat improperly begins to bear\r\nthe name of ticuna, is extracted from a liana which grows in the\r\nisland of Mormorote, on the Upper Maranon. This poison is employed\r\npartly by the Ticunas, who remain independent on the Spanish territory\r\nnear the sources of the Yacarique; and partly by Indians of the same\r\ntribe, inhabiting the Portuguese mission of Loreto. The poisons we\r\nhave just named differ totally from that of La Peca, and from the\r\npoison of Lamas and of Moyobamba. I enter into these details because\r\nthe vestiges of plants which we were able to examine, proved to us\r\n(contrary to the common opinion) that the three poisons of the\r\nTicunas, of La Peca, and of Moyobamba are not obtained from the same\r\nspecies, probably not even from congeneric plants. In proportion as\r\nthe preparation of the curare is simple, that of the poison of\r\nMoyobamba is a long and complicated process. With the juice of the\r\nbejuco de ambihuasca, which is the principal ingredient, are mixed\r\npimento, tobacco, barbasco (Jacquinia armillaris), sanango (Tabernae\r\nmontana), and the milk of some other apocyneae. The fresh juice of the\r\nambihuasca has a deleterious action when in contact with the blood;\r\nthe juice of the mavacure is a mortal poison only when it is\r\nconcentrated by fire; and ebullition deprives the juice of the root of\r\nJatropha manihot (the manioc) of all its baneful qualities. In rubbing\r\na long time between my fingers the liana which yields the potent\r\npoison of La Peca, when the weather was excessively hot, my hands were\r\nbenumbed; and a person who was employed with me felt the same effects\r\nfrom this rapid absorption by the uninjured integuments.\r\n\r\nI shall not here enter into any detail on the physiological properties\r\nof those poisons of the New World which kill with the same promptitude\r\nas the strychneae of Asia,* (* The nux vomica, the upas tieute, and\r\nthe bean of St. Ignatius, Strychnos Ignatia.) but without producing\r\nvomiting when they are received into the stomach, and without denoting\r\nthe approach of death by the violent excitement of the spinal marrow.\r\nScarcely a fowl is eaten on the banks of the Orinoco which has not\r\nbeen killed with a poisoned arrow; and the missionaries allege that\r\nthe flesh of animals is never so good as when this method is employed.\r\nFather Zea, who accompanied us, though ill of a tertian fever, every\r\nmorning had the live fowls allotted for our food brought to his\r\nhammock together with an arrow, and he killed them himself; for he\r\nwould not confide this operation, to which he attached great\r\nimportance, to any other person. Large birds, a guan (pava de monte)\r\nfor instance, or a curassao (alector), when wounded in the thigh, die\r\nin two or three minutes; but it is often ten or twelve minutes before\r\nlife is extinct in a pig or a peccary. M. Bonpland found that the same\r\npoison, bought in different villages, varied much. We had procured at\r\nthe river Amazon some real Ticuna poison which was less potent than\r\nany of the varieties of the curare of the Orinoco. Travellers, on\r\narriving in the missions, frequently testify their apprehension on\r\nlearning that the fowls, monkeys, guanas, and even the fish which they\r\neat, have been killed with poisoned arrows. But these fears are\r\ngroundless. Majendie has proved by his ingenious experiments on\r\ntransfusion, that the blood of animals on which the bitter strychnos\r\nof India has produced a deleterious effect, has no fatal action on\r\nother animals. A dog received a considerable quantity of poisoned\r\nblood into his veins without any trace of irritation being perceived\r\nin the spinal marrow.\r\n\r\nI placed the most active curare in contact with the crural nerves of a\r\nfrog, without perceiving any sensible change in measuring the degree\r\nof irritability of the organs, by means of an arc formed of\r\nheterogeneous metals. Galvanic experiments succeeded upon birds, some\r\nminutes after I had killed them with a poisoned arrow. These\r\nobservations are not uninteresting, when we recollect that a solution\r\nof the upas-poison poured upon the sciatic nerve, or insinuated into\r\nthe texture of the nerve, produces also a sensible effect on the\r\nirritability of the organs by immediate contact with the medullary\r\nsubstance. The danger of the curare, as of most of the other\r\nstrychneae (for we continue to believe that the mavacure belongs to a\r\nneighbouring family), results only from the action of the poison on\r\nthe vascular system. At Maypures, a zambo descended from an Indian and\r\na negro, prepared for M. Bonpland some of those poisoned arrows, that\r\nare shot from blowing-tubes to kill small monkeys or birds. He was a\r\nman of remarkable muscular strength. Having had the imprudence to rub\r\nthe curare between his fingers after being slightly wounded, he fell\r\non the ground seized with a vertigo, that lasted nearly half an hour.\r\nHappily the poison was of that diluted kind which is used for very\r\nsmall animals, that is, for those which it is believed can be recalled\r\nto life by putting muriate of soda into the wound. During our passage\r\nin returning from Esmeralda to Atures, I myself narrowly escaped an\r\nimminent danger. The curare, having imbibed the humidity of the air,\r\nhad become fluid, and was spilt from an imperfectly closed jar upon\r\nour linen. The person who washed the linen had neglected to examine\r\nthe inside of a stocking, which was filled with curare; and it was\r\nonly on touching this glutinous matter with my hand, that I was warned\r\nnot to draw on the poisoned stocking. The danger was so much the\r\ngreater, as my feet at that time were bleeding from the wounds made by\r\nchegoes (Pulex penetrans), which had not been well extirpated. This\r\ncircumstance may warn travellers of the caution requisite in the\r\nconveyance of poisons.\r\n\r\nAn interesting chemical and physiological investigation remains to be\r\naccomplished in Europe on the poisons of the New World, when, by more\r\nfrequent communications, the curare de bejuco, the curare de raiz, and\r\nthe various poisons of the Amazon, Guallaga, and Brazil, can be\r\nprocured, without being confounded together, from the places where\r\nthey are prepared. Since the discovery of prussic acid,* (* First\r\nobtained by Scheele in the year 1782. Gay-Lussac (to whom we are\r\nindebted for the complete analysis of this acid) observes that it can\r\nnever become very dangerous to society, because its peculiar smell\r\n(that of bitter almonds) betrays its presence, and the facility with\r\nwhich it is decomposed makes it difficult to preserve.) and many other\r\nnew substances eminently deleterious, the introduction of poisons\r\nprepared by savage nations is less feared in Europe; we cannot however\r\nappeal too strongly to the vigilance of those who keep such noxious\r\nsubstances in the midst of populous cities, the centres of\r\ncivilization, misery, and depravity. Our botanical knowledge of the\r\nplants employed in making poison can be but very slowly acquired. Most\r\nof the Indians who make poisoned arrows, are totally ignorant of the\r\nnature of the venomous substances they use, and which they obtain from\r\nother people. A mysterious veil everywhere covers the history of\r\npoisons and of their antidotes. Their preparation among savages is the\r\nmonopoly of the piaches, who are at once priests, jugglers, and\r\nphysicians; it is only from the natives who are transplanted to the\r\nmissions, that any certain notions can be acquired on matters so\r\nproblematical. Ages elapsed before Europeans became acquainted through\r\nthe investigation of M. Mutis, with the bejuco del guaco (Mikania\r\nguaco), which is the most powerful of all antidotes against the bite\r\nof serpents, and of which we were fortunate enough to give the first\r\nbotanical description.\r\n\r\nThe opinion is very general in the missions that no cure is possible,\r\nif the curare be fresh, well concentrated, and have stayed long in the\r\nwound, to have entered freely into the circulation. Among the\r\nspecifics employed on the banks of the Orinoco, and in the Indian\r\nArchipelago, the most celebrated is muriate of soda.* (* Oviedo,\r\nSommario delle Indie Orientali, recommends sea-water as an antidote\r\nagainst vegetable poisons. The people in the missions never fail to\r\nassure European travellers, that they have no more to fear from arrows\r\ndipped in curare, if they have a little salt in their mouths, than\r\nfrom the electric shocks of the gymnoti, when chewing tobacco. Raleigh\r\nrecommends as an antidote to the ourari (curare) the juice of garlick.\r\n[But later experiments have completely proved that if the poison has\r\nonce fairly entered into combination with the blood there is no\r\nremedy, either for man or any of the inferior animals. The wourali and\r\nother poisons mentioned by Humboldt have, since the publication of\r\nthis work, been carefully analysed by the first chemists of Europe,\r\nand experiments made on their symptoms and supposed remedies.\r\nArtificial inflation of the lungs was found the most successful, but\r\nin very few instances was any cure effected.]) The wound is rubbed\r\nwith this salt, which is also taken internally. I had myself no direct\r\nand sufficiently convincing proof of the action of this specific; and\r\nthe experiments of Delille and Majendie rather tend to disprove its\r\nefficacy. On the banks of the Amazon, the preference among the\r\nantidotes is given to sugar; and muriate of soda being a substance\r\nalmost unknown to the Indians of the forests, it is probable that the\r\nhoney of bees, and that farinaceous sugar which oozes from plantains\r\ndried in the sun, were anciently employed throughout Guiana. In vain\r\nhave ammonia and eau-de-luce been tried against the curare; it is now\r\nknown that these specifics are uncertain, even when applied to wounds\r\ncaused by the bite of serpents. Sir Everard Home has shown that a cure\r\nis often attributed to a remedy, when it is owing only to the\r\nslightness of the wound, and to a very circumscribed action of the\r\npoison. Animals may with impunity be wounded with poisoned arrows, if\r\nthe wound be well laid open, and the point imbued with poison be\r\nwithdrawn immediately after the wound is made. If salt or sugar be\r\nemployed in these cases, people are tempted to regard them as\r\nexcellent specifics. Indians, who had been wounded in battle by\r\nweapons dipped in the curare, described to us the symptoms they\r\nexperienced, which were entirely similar to those observed in the bite\r\nof serpents. The wounded person feels congestion in the head, vertigo,\r\nand nausea. He is tormented by a raging thirst, and numbness pervades\r\nall the parts that are near the wound.\r\n\r\nThe old Indian, who was called the poison-master, seemed flattered by\r\nthe interest we took in his chemical processes. He found us\r\nsufficiently intelligent to lead him to the belief that we knew how to\r\nmake soap, an art which, next to the preparation of curare, appeared\r\nto him one of the finest of human inventions. When the liquid poison\r\nhad been poured into the vessels prepared for their reception, we\r\naccompanied the Indian to the festival of the juvias. The harvest of\r\njuvias, or fruits of the Bertholletia excelsa,* (* The Brazil-nut.)\r\nwas celebrated by dancing, and by excesses of wild intoxication. The\r\nhut where the natives were assembled, displayed during several days a\r\nvery singular aspect. There was neither table nor bench; but large\r\nroasted monkeys, blackened by smoke, were ranged in regular order\r\nagainst the wall. These were the marimondes (Ateles belzebuth), and\r\nthose bearded monkeys called capuchins, which must not be confounded\r\nwith the weeper, or sai (Simia capucina of Buffon). The manner of\r\nroasting these anthropomorphous animals contributes to render their\r\nappearance extremely disagreeable in the eyes of civilized man. A\r\nlittle grating or lattice of very hard wood is formed, and raised one\r\nfoot from the ground. The monkey is skinned, and bent into a sitting\r\nposture; the head generally resting on the arms, which are meagre and\r\nlong; but sometimes these are crossed behind the back. When it is tied\r\non the grating, a very clear fire is kindled below. The monkey,\r\nenveloped in smoke and flame, is broiled and blackened at the same\r\ntime. On seeing the natives devour the arm or leg of a roasted monkey,\r\nit is difficult not to believe that this habit of eating animals so\r\nclosely resembling man in their physical organization, has, to a\r\ncertain degree, contributed to diminish the horror of cannibalism\r\namong these people. Roasted monkeys, particularly those which have\r\nvery round heads, display a hideous resemblance to a child; and\r\nconsequently Europeans who are obliged to feed on them prefer\r\nseparating the head and the hands, and serve up only the rest of the\r\nanimal at their tables. The flesh of monkeys is so lean and dry, that\r\nM. Bonpland has preserved in his collections at Paris an arm and hand,\r\nwhich had been broiled over the fire at Esmeralda; and no smell has\r\narisen from them after the lapse of a great number of years.\r\n\r\nWe saw the Indians dance. The monotony of their dancing is increased\r\nby the women not daring to take part in it. The men, young and old,\r\nform a circle, holding each others' hands; and turn sometimes to the\r\nright, sometimes to the left, for whole hours, with silent gravity.\r\nMost frequently the dancers themselves are the musicians. Feeble\r\nsounds, drawn from a series of reeds of different lengths, form a slow\r\nand plaintive accompaniment. The first dancer, to mark the time, bends\r\nboth knees in a kind of cadence. Sometimes they all make a pause in\r\ntheir places, and execute little oscillatory movements, bending the\r\nbody from one side to the other. The reeds ranged in a line, and\r\nfastened together, resemble the Pan's pipes, as we find them\r\nrepresented in the bacchanalian processions on Grecian vases. To unite\r\nreeds of different lengths, and make them sound in succession by\r\npassing them before the lips, is a simple idea, and has naturally\r\npresented itself to every nation. We were surprised to see with what\r\npromptitude the young Indians constructed and tuned these pipes, when\r\nthey found reeds on the bank of the river. Uncivilized men, in every\r\nzone, make great use of these gramina with high stalks. The Greeks,\r\nwith truth, said that reeds had contributed to subjugate nations by\r\nfurnishing arrows, to soften men's manners by the charm of music, and\r\nto unfold their understanding by affording the first instruments for\r\ntracing letters. These different uses of reeds mark in some sort three\r\ndifferent periods in the life of nations. We must admit that the\r\ntribes of the Orinoco are in the first stage of dawning civilization.\r\nThe reed serves them only as an instrument of war and of hunting; and\r\nthe Pan's pipes, of which we have spoken, have not yet, on those\r\ndistant shores, yielded sounds capable of awakening mild and humane\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nWe found in the hut allotted for the festival, several vegetable\r\nproductions which the Indians had brought from the mountains of\r\nGuanaya, and which engaged our attention. I shall only here mention\r\nthe fruit of the juvia, reeds of a prodigious length, and shirts made\r\nof the bark of marima. The almendron, or juvia, one of the most\r\nmajestic trees of the forests of the New World, was almost unknown\r\nbefore our visit to the Rio Negro. It begins to be found after a\r\njourney of four days east of Esmeralda, between the Padamo and Ocamo,\r\nat the foot of the Cerro Mapaya, on the right bank of the Orinoco. It\r\nis still more abundant on the left bank, at the Cerro Guanaja, between\r\nthe Rio Amaguaca and the Gehette. The inhabitants of Esmeralda assured\r\nus, that in advancing above the Gehette and the Chiguire, the juvia\r\nand cacao-trees become so common that the wild Indians (the Guaicas\r\nand Guaharibos) do not disturb the Indians of the missions when\r\ngathering in their harvests. They do not envy them the productions\r\nwith which nature has enriched their own soil. Scarcely any attempt\r\nhas been made to propagate the almendrones in the settlements of the\r\nUpper Orinoco. To this the indolence of the inhabitants is a greater\r\nobstacle than the rapidity with which the oil becomes rancid in the\r\namygdaliform seeds. We found only three trees of the kind at the\r\nmission of San Carlos, and two at Esmeralda. These majestic trees were\r\neight or ten years old, and had not yet borne flowers.\r\n\r\nAs early as the sixteenth century, the seeds with ligneous and\r\ntriangular teguments (but not the great drupe like a cocoa-nut, which\r\ncontains the almonds,) were known in Europe. I recognise them in an\r\nimperfect engraving of Clusius.* (* Clusius distinguishes very\r\nproperly the almendras del Peru, our Bertholletia excelsa, or juvia,\r\n(fructus amygdalae-nucleo, triangularis, dorso lato, in bina latera\r\nangulosa desinente, rugosus, paululum cuneiformis) from the pekea, or\r\nAmygdala guayanica. Raleigh, who knew none of the productions of the\r\nUpper Orinoco, does not speak of the juvia; but it appears that he\r\nfirst brought to Europe the fruit of the mauritia palm, of which we\r\nhave so often spoken. (Fructus elegantissimus, squamosus, similis\r\npalmae-pini.) This botanist designates them under the name of\r\nalmendras del Peru. They had no doubt been carried, as a very rare\r\nfruit, to the Upper Maranon, and thence, by the Cordilleras, to Quito\r\nand Peru. The Novus Orbis of Laet, in which I found the first account\r\nof the cow-tree, furnishes also a description and a figure singularly\r\nexact of the fruit of the bertholletia. Laet calls the tree totocke,\r\nand mentions the drupe of the size of the human head, which contains\r\nthe almonds. The weight of these fruits, he says, is so enormous, that\r\nthe savages dare not enter the forests without covering their heads\r\nand shoulders with a buckler of very hard wood. These bucklers are\r\nunknown to the natives of Esmeralda, but they told us of the danger\r\nincurred when the fruit ripens and falls from a height of fifty or\r\nsixty feet. The triangular seeds of the juvia are sold in Portugal\r\nunder the vague appellation of chesnuts (castanas) of the Amazon, and\r\nin England under the name of Brazil-nuts; and it was long believed\r\nthat, like the fruit of the pekea, they grew on separate stalks. They\r\nhave furnished an article of trade for a century past to the\r\ninhabitants of Grand Para, by whom they are sent either directly to\r\nEurope, or to Cayenne, where they are called touka. The celebrated\r\nbotanist, Correa de Serra, told us that this tree abounds in the\r\nforests in the neighbourhood of Macapa, at the mouth of the Amazon;\r\nthat it there bears the name of capucaya, and that the inhabitants\r\ngather the almonds, like those of the lecythis, to express the oil. A\r\ncargo of almonds of the juvia, bought into Havre, captured by a\r\nprivateer, in 1807, was employed for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe tree that yields the Brazil-nuts is generally not more than two or\r\nthree feet in diameter, but attains one hundred or one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet in height. It does not resemble the mammee-tree, the\r\nstar-apple, and several other trees of the tropics, the branches of\r\nwhich (as in the laurel-trees of the temperate zone) rise almost\r\nstraight towards the sky. The branches of the bertholletia are open,\r\nvery long, almost entirely bare towards the base, and loaded at their\r\nsummits with tufts of very close foliage. This disposition of the\r\nsemicoriaceous leaves, which are a little silvery on their under part,\r\nand more than two feet long, makes the branches bend down toward the\r\nground, like the fronds of the palm-tree. We did not see this majestic\r\ntree in blossom: it is not loaded with flowers* till in its fifteenth\r\nyear, and they appear about the end of March and the beginning of\r\nApril. (* According to accounts somewhat vague, they are yellow, very\r\nlarge, and have some similitude to those of the Bombax ceiba. M.\r\nBonpland says, however, in his botanical journal written on the banks\r\nof the Rio Negro, flos violaceus. It was thus the Indians of the river\r\nhad described to him the colour of the corolla.) The fruits ripen\r\ntowards the end of May, and some trees retain them till the end of\r\nAugust. These fruits, which are as large as the head of a child, often\r\ntwelve or thirteen inches in diameter, make a very loud noise in\r\nfalling from the tops of the trees. Nothing is more fitted to fill the\r\nmind with admiration of the force of organic action in the equinoctial\r\nzone than the aspect of those great igneous pericarps, for instance,\r\nthe cocoa-tree (lodoicea) of the Maldives among the monocotyledons,\r\nand the bertholletia and the lecythis among the dicotyledons. In our\r\nclimates only the cucurbitaceae produce in the space of a few months\r\nfruits of an extraordinary size; but these fruits are pulpy and\r\nsucculent. Within the tropics, the bertholletia forms in less than\r\nfifty or sixty days a pericarp, the ligneous part of which is half an\r\ninch thick, and which it is difficult to saw with the sharpest\r\ninstruments. A great naturalist has observed, that the wood of fruits\r\nattains in general a hardness which is scarcely to be found in the\r\nwood of the trunks of trees. The pericarp of the bertholletia has\r\ntraces of four cells, and I have sometimes found even five. The seeds\r\nhave two very distinct coverings, and this circumstance renders the\r\nstructure of the fruit more complicated than in the lecythis, the\r\npekea or caryocar, and the saouvari. The first tegument is osseous or\r\nligneous, triangular, tuberculated on its exterior surface, and of the\r\ncolour of cinnamon. Four or five, and sometimes eight of these\r\ntriangular nuts, are attached to a central partition. As they are\r\nloosened in time, they move freely in the large spherical pericarp.\r\nThe capuchin monkeys (Simia chiropotes) are singularly fond of the\r\nBrazil nuts; and the noise made by the seeds, when the fruit is shaken\r\nas it falls from the tree, excites the appetites of these animals in\r\nthe highest degree. I have most frequently found only from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-two nuts in each fruit. The second tegument of the almonds is\r\nmembranaceous, and of a brown-yellow. Their taste is extremely\r\nagreeable when they are fresh; but the oil, with which they abound,\r\nand which is so useful in the arts, becomes easily rancid. Although at\r\nthe Upper Orinoco we often ate considerable quantities of these\r\nalmonds for want of other food, we never felt any bad effects from so\r\ndoing. The spherical pericarp of the bertholletia, perforated at the\r\nsummit, is not dehiscent; the upper and swelled part of the columella\r\nforms (according to M. Kunth) a sort of inner cover, as in the fruit\r\nof the lecythis, but it seldom opens of itself. Many seeds, from the\r\ndecomposition of the oil contained in the cotyledons, lose the faculty\r\nof germination before the rainy season, in which the ligneous\r\nintegument of the pericarp opens by the effect of putrefaction. A tale\r\nis very current on the banks of the Lower Orinoco, that the capuchin\r\nand cacajao monkeys (Simia chiropotes, and Simia melanocephala) place\r\nthemselves in a circle, and, by striking the shell with a stone,\r\nsucceed in opening it, so as to take out the triangular nuts. This\r\noperation must, however, be impossible, on account of the extreme\r\nhardness and thickness of the pericarp. Monkeys may have been seen\r\nrolling along the fruit of the bertholletia, but though this fruit has\r\na small hole closed by the upper extremity of the columella, nature\r\nhas not furnished monkeys with the means of opening the ligneous\r\npericarp, as it has of opening the covercle of the lecythis, called in\r\nthe missions the covercle of the monkeys' cocoa.* (* La tapa del coco\r\nde monos.) According to the report of several Indians, only the\r\nsmaller rodentia, particularly the cavies (the acuri and the lapa), by\r\nthe structure of their teeth, and the inconceivable perseverance with\r\nwhich they pursue their destructive operations, succeed in perforating\r\nthe fruit of the juvia. As soon as the triangular nuts are spread on\r\nthe ground, all the animals of the forest, the monkeys, the manaviris,\r\nthe squirrels, the cavies, the parrots, and the macaws, hastily\r\nassemble to dispute the prey. They have all strength enough to break\r\nthe ligneous tegument of the seed; they get out the kernel, and carry\r\nit to the tops of the trees. \"It is their festival also,\" said the\r\nIndians who had returned from the harvest; and on hearing their\r\ncomplaints of the animals, one may perceive that they think themselves\r\nalone the lawful masters of the forest.\r\n\r\nOne of the four canoes, which had taken the Indians to the gathering\r\nof the Juvias, was filled in great part with that species of reeds\r\n(carices) of which the blow-tubes are made. These reeds were from\r\nfifteen to seventeen feet long, yet no trace of a knot for the\r\ninsertion of leaves and branches was perceived. They were quite\r\nstraight, smooth externally, and perfectly cylindrical. These carices\r\ncome from the foot of the mountains of Yumariquin and Guanaja. They\r\nare much sought after, even beyond the Orinoco, by the name of reeds\r\nof Esmeralda. A hunter preserves the same blow-tube during his whole\r\nlife, and boasts of its lightness and precision, as we boast of the\r\nsame qualities in our fire-arms. What is the monocotyledonous plant*\r\nthat furnishes these admirable reeds? (* The smooth surface of these\r\ntubes sufficiently proves that they are not furnished by a plant of\r\nthe family of umbelliferae.) Did we see in fact the internodes (parts\r\nbetween the knots) of a gramen of the tribe of nastoides? or may this\r\ncarex be perhaps a cyperaceous plant* destitute of knots? (* The\r\ncaricillo del manati, which grows abundantly on the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, attains from eight to ten feet in height.) I cannot solve\r\nthis question, or determine to what genus another plant belongs, which\r\nfurnishes the shirts of marima. We saw on the slope of the Cerra Duida\r\nshirt-trees fifty feet high. The Indians cut off cylindrical pieces\r\ntwo feet in diameter, from which they peel the red and fibrous bark,\r\nwithout making any longitudinal incision. This bark affords them a\r\nsort of garment, which resembles sacks of a very coarse texture, and\r\nwithout a seam. The upper opening serves for the head; and two lateral\r\nholes are cut for the arms to pass through. The natives wear these\r\nshirts of marima in the rainy season: they have the form of the\r\nponchos and ruanas of cotton, which are so common in New Grenada, at\r\nQuito, and in Peru. In these climates the riches and beneficence of\r\nnature being regarded as the primary causes of the indolence of the\r\ninhabitants, the missionaries say in showing the shirts of marima, in\r\nthe forests of the Orinoco garments are found ready-made on the trees.\r\nWe may also mention the pointed caps, which the spathes of certain\r\npalm-trees furnish, and which resemble coarse network.\r\n\r\nAt the festival of which we were the spectators, the women, who were\r\nexcluded from the dance, and every sort of public rejoicing, were\r\ndaily occupied in serving the men with roasted monkey, fermented\r\nliquors, and palm-cabbage. This last production has the taste of our\r\ncauliflowers, and in no other country had we seen specimens of such an\r\nimmense size. The leaves that are not unfolded are united with the\r\nyoung stem, and we measured cylinders of six feet long and five inches\r\nin diameter. Another substance, which is much more nutritive, is\r\nobtained from the animal kingdom: this is fish-flour (manioc de\r\npescado). The Indians throughout the Upper Orinoco fry fish, dry them\r\nin the sun, and reduce them to powder without separating the bones. I\r\nhave seen masses of fifty or sixty pounds of this flour, which\r\nresembles that of cassava. When it is wanted for eating, it is mixed\r\nwith water, and reduced to a paste. In every climate the abundance of\r\nfish has led to the invention of the same means of preserving them.\r\nPliny and Diodorus Siculus have described the fish-bread of the\r\nichthyophagous nations, that dwelt on the Persian Gulf and the shores\r\nof the Red Sea.* (* These nations, in a still ruder state than the\r\nnatives of the Orinoco, contented themselves with drying the raw fish\r\nin the sun. They made up the fish-paste in the form of bricks, and\r\nsometimes mixed with it the aromatic seed of paliurus (rhamnus), as in\r\nGermany, and some other countries, cummin and fennel-seed are mixed\r\nwith wheaten bread.)\r\n\r\nAt Esmeralda, as everywhere else throughout the missions, the Indians\r\nwho will not be baptized, and who are merely aggregated in the\r\ncommunity, live in a state of polygamy. The number of wives differs\r\nmuch in different tribes. It is most considerable among the Caribs,\r\nand all the nations that have preserved the custom of carrying off\r\nyoung girls from the neighbouring tribes. How can we imagine domestic\r\nhappiness in so unequal an association? The women live in a sort of\r\nslavery, as they do in most nations which are in a state of barbarism.\r\nThe husbands being in the full enjoyment of absolute power, no\r\ncomplaint is heard in their presence. An apparent tranquillity\r\nprevails in the household; the women are eager to anticipate the\r\nwishes of an imperious and sullen master; and they attend without\r\ndistinction to their own children and those of their rivals. The\r\nmissionaries assert, what may easily be believed, that this domestic\r\npeace, the effect of fear, is singularly disturbed when the husband is\r\nlong absent. The wife who contracted the first ties then applies to\r\nthe others the names of concubines and servants. The quarrels continue\r\ntill the return of the master, who knows how to calm their passions by\r\nthe sound of his voice, by a mere gesticulation, or, if he thinks it\r\nnecessary, by means a little more violent. A certain inequality in the\r\nrights of the women is sanctioned by the language of the Tamanacs. The\r\nhusband calls the second and third wife the companions of the first;\r\nand the first treats these companions as rivals and enemies\r\n(ipucjatoje), a term which truly expresses their position. The whole\r\nweight of labour being supported by these unhappy women, we must not\r\nbe surprised if, in some nations, their number is extremely small.\r\nWhere this happens, a kind of polyandry is formed, which we find more\r\nfully displayed in Thibet, and on the lofty mountains at the extremity\r\nof the Indian peninsula. Among the Avanos and Maypures, brothers have\r\noften but one wife. When an Indian, who lives in polygamy, becomes a\r\nchristian, he is compelled by the missionaries, to choose among his\r\nwives her whom he prefers, and to reject the others. At the moment of\r\nseparation the new convert sometimes discovers the most valuable\r\nqualities in the wives he is obliged to abandon. One understands\r\ngardening perfectly; another knows how to prepare chiza, an\r\nintoxicating beverage extracted from the root of cassava; all appear\r\nto him alike clever and useful. Sometimes the desire of preserving his\r\nwives overcomes in the Indian his inclination to christianity; but\r\nmost frequently, in his perplexity, the husband prefers submitting to\r\nthe choice of the missionary, as to a blind fatality.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, who from May to August take journeys to the east of\r\nEsmeralda, to gather the vegetable productions of the mountains of\r\nYumariquin, gave us precise notions of the course of the Orinoco to\r\nthe east of the mission. This part of my itinerary may differ entirely\r\nfrom the maps that preceded it. I shall begin the description of this\r\ncountry with the granitic group of Duida, at the foot of which we\r\nsojourned. This group is bounded on the west by the Rio Tamatama, and\r\non the east by the Rio Guapo. Between these two tributary streams of\r\nthe Orinoco, amid the morichales, or clumps of mauritia palm-trees,\r\nwhich surround Esmeralda, the Rio Sodomoni flows, celebrated for the\r\nexcellence of the pine-apples that grow upon its banks. I measured, on\r\nthe 22nd of May, in the savannah at the foot of Duida, a base of four\r\nhundred and seventy-five metres in length; the angle, under which the\r\nsummit of the mountain appeared at the distance of thirteen thousand\r\nthree hundred and twenty-seven metres, was still nine degrees. A\r\ntrigonometric measurement, made with great care, gave me for Duida\r\n(that is, for the most elevated peak, which is south-west of the Cerro\r\nMaraguaca) two thousand one hundred and seventy-nine metres, or one\r\nthousand one hundred and eighteen toises, above the plain of\r\nEsmeralda. The Cerro Duida thus yields but little in height (scarcely\r\neighty or one hundred toises) to the summit of St. Gothard, or the\r\nSilla of Caracas on the shore of Venezuela. It is indeed considered as\r\na colossal mountain in those countries; and this celebrity gives a\r\nprecise idea of the mean height of Parima and of all the mountains of\r\neastern America. To the east of the Sierra Nevada de Merida, as well\r\nas to the south-east of the Paramo de las Rosas, none of the chains\r\nthat extend in the same parallel line reach the height of the central\r\nridge of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nThe granitic summit of Duida is so nearly perpendicular that the\r\nIndians have vainly attempted the ascent. It is a well-known fact that\r\nmountains not remarkable for elevation are sometimes the most\r\ninaccessible. At the beginning and end of the rainy season, small\r\nflames, which seem to change their place, are seen on the top of\r\nDuida. This phenomenon, the existence of which is borne out by\r\nconcurrent testimony, has caused this mountain to be improperly called\r\na volcano. As it stands nearly alone, it might be supposed that\r\nlightning from time to time sets fire to the brushwood; but this\r\nsupposition loses its probability when we reflect on the extreme\r\ndifficulty with which plants are ignited in these damp climates. It\r\nmust be observed also that these flames are said to appear often where\r\nthe rock seems scarcely covered with turf, and that the same igneous\r\nphenomena are visible, on days entirely exempt from storms, on the\r\nsummit of Guaraco or Murcielago, a hill opposite the mouth of the Rio\r\nTamatama, on the southern bank of the Orinoco. This hill is scarcely\r\nelevated one hundred toises above the neighbouring plains. If the\r\nstatements of the natives be correct, it is probable that some\r\nsubterraneous cause produces these flames on the Duida and the\r\nGuaraco; for they never appear on the lofty neighbouring mountains of\r\nJao and Maraguaca, so often wrapped in electric storms. The granite of\r\nthe Cerro Duida is full of veins, partly open, and partly filled with\r\ncrystals of quartz and pyrites. Gaseous and inflammable emanations,\r\neither of hydrogen or of naphtha, may pass through these veins. Of\r\nthis the mountains of Caramania, of Hindookho, and of Himalaya,\r\nfurnish frequent examples. We saw the appearance of flames in many\r\nparts of eastern America subject to earthquakes, even from secondary\r\nrocks, as at Cuchivero, near Cumanacoa. The fire shows itself when the\r\nground, strongly heated by the sun, receives the first rains; or when,\r\nafter violent showers, the earth begins to dry. The first cause of\r\nthese igneous phenomena lies at immense depths below the secondary\r\nrocks, in the primitive formations: the rains and the decomposition of\r\natmospheric water act only a secondary part. The hottest springs of\r\nthe globe issue immediately from granite. Petroleum gushes from\r\nmica-schist; and frightful detonations are heard at Encaramada,\r\nbetween the rivers Arauca and Cuchivero, in the midst of the granitic\r\nsoil of the Orinoco and the Sierra Parima. Here, as everywhere else on\r\nthe globe, the focus of volcanoes is in the most ancient soils; and it\r\nappears that an intimate connection exists between the great phenomena\r\nthat heave up and liquify the crust of our planet, and those igneous\r\nmeteors which are seen from time to time on its surface, and which\r\nfrom their littleness we are tempted to attribute solely to the\r\ninfluence of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuida, though lower than the height assigned to it by popular belief,\r\nis however the most prominent point of the whole group of mountains\r\nthat separate the basin of the Lower Orinoco from that of the Amazon.\r\nThese mountains lower still more rapidly on the north-east, toward the\r\nPurunama, than on the east, toward the Padamo and the Rio Ocamo. In\r\nthe former direction the most elevated summits next to Duida are\r\nCuneva, at the sources of the Rio Paru (one of the tributary streams\r\nof the Ventuari), Sipapo, Calitamini, which forms one group with\r\nCunavami and the peak of Umiana. East of Duida, on the right bank of\r\nthe Orinoco, Maravaca, or Sierra Maraguaca, is distinguished by its\r\nelevation, between the Rio Caurimoni and the Padamo; and on the left\r\nbank of the Orinoco rise the mountains of Guanaja and Yumariquin,\r\nbetween the Rios Amaguaca and Gehette. It is almost superfluous to\r\nrepeat that the line which passes through these lofty summits (like\r\nthose of the Pyrenees, the Carpathian mountains, and so many other\r\nchains of the old continent) is very distinct from the line that marks\r\nthe partition of the waters. This latter line, which separates the\r\ntributary streams of the Lower and Upper Orinoco, intersects the\r\nmeridian of 64 degrees in latitude 4 degrees. After having separated\r\nthe sources of the Rio Branco and the Carony, it runs north-west,\r\nsending off the waters of the Padamo, the Jao, and the Ventuari\r\ntowards the south, and the waters of the Arui, the Caura, and the\r\nCuchivero towards the north.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco may be ascended without danger from Esmeralda as far as\r\nthe cataracts occupied by the Guaica Indians, who prevent all farther\r\nprogress of the Spaniards. This is a voyage of six days and a half. In\r\nthe first two days you arrive at the mouth of the Rio Padamo, or\r\nPatamo, having passed, on the north, the little rivers of Tamatama,\r\nSodomoni, Guapo, Caurimoni, and Simirimoni; and on the south the Cuca,\r\nsituate between the rock of Guaraco, which is said to throw out\r\nflames, and the Cerro Canclilla. Throughout this course the Orinoco\r\ncontinues to be three or four hundred toises broad. The tributary\r\nstreams are most frequent on the right bank, because on that side the\r\nriver is bounded by the lofty cloud-capped mountains of Duida and\r\nMaraguaca, while the left bank on the contrary is low and contiguous\r\nto a plain, the general slope of which inclines to the south-west. The\r\nnorthern Cordilleras are covered with fine timber. The growth of\r\nplants is so enormous in this hot and constantly humid climate, that\r\nthe trunks of the Bombax ceiba are sixteen feet in diameter. From the\r\nmouth of the Rio Padamo, which is of considerable breadth, the Indians\r\narrive, in a day and a half, at the Rio Mavaca. The latter takes its\r\nrise in the lofty mountains of Unturan, and communicates with a lake,\r\non the banks of which the Portuguese* of the Rio Negro gather the\r\naromatic seeds of the Laurus pucheri, known in trade by the names of\r\nthe pichurim bean, and toda specie. (* The pichurim bean is the\r\npuchiri of La Condamine, which abounds at the Rio Xingu, a tributary\r\nstream of the Amazon, and on the banks of the Hyurubaxy, or Yurubesh,\r\nwhich runs into the Rio Negro. The puchery, or pichurim, which is\r\ngrated like nutmeg, differs from another aromatic fruit (a laurel?)\r\nknown in trade at Grand Para by the names of cucheri, cuchiri, or\r\ncravo (clavus) do Maranhao, and which, on account of its odour, is\r\ncompared with cloves.) Between the confluence of the Padamo and that\r\nof the Mavaca, the Orinoco receives on the north the Ocamo, into which\r\nthe Rio Matacona falls. At the sources of the latter live the\r\nGuainares, who are much less copper-coloured, or tawny, than the other\r\ninhabitants of those countries. This is one of the tribes called by\r\nthe missionaries fair Indians (Indios blancos). Near the mouth of the\r\nOcamo, travellers are shown a rock, which is the wonder of the\r\ncountry. It is a granite passing into gneiss, and remarkable for the\r\npeculiar distribution of the black mica, which forms little ramified\r\nveins. The Spaniards call this rock Piedra Mapaya (the map-stone). The\r\nlittle fragment which I procured indicated a stratified rock, rich in\r\nwhite feldspar, and containing, together with spangles of mica,\r\ngrouped in streaks, and variously twisted, some crystals of\r\nhornblende. It is not a syenite, but probably a granite of new\r\nformation, analogous to those to which the stanniferous granites\r\n(hyalomictes) and the pegmatites, or graphic granites, belong.\r\n\r\nBeyond the confluence of the Macava, the Orinoco suddenly diminishes\r\nin breadth and depth, becoming extremely sinuous, like an Alpine\r\ntorrent. Its banks are surrounded by mountains, and the number of its\r\ntributary streams on the south augments considerably, yet the\r\nCordillera on the north remains the most elevated. It requires two\r\ndays to go from the mouth of the Macava, to the Rio Gehette, the\r\nnavigation being very difficult, and the boats, on account of the want\r\nof water, being often dragged along the shore. The tributary streams\r\nalong this distance are, on the south, the Daracapo and the Amaguaca;\r\nwhich skirt on the west and east the mountains of Guanaya and\r\nYumariquin, where the bertholletias are gathered. The Rio Manaviche\r\nflows down from the mountains on the north, the elevation of which\r\ndiminishes progressively from the Cerro Maraguaca. As we advance\r\nfurther up the Orinoco, the whirlpools and little rapids (chorros y\r\nremolinos) become more and more frequent; on the north lies the Cano\r\nChiquire, inhabited by the Guaicas, another tribe of white Indians;\r\nand two leagues distant is the mouth of the Gehette, where there is a\r\ngreat cataract. A dyke of granitic rocks crosses the Orinoco these\r\nrocks are, as it were, the columns of Hercules, beyond which no white\r\nman has been able to penetrate. It appears that this point, known by\r\nthe name of the great Raudal de Guaharibos, is three-quarters of a\r\ndegree west of Esmeralda, consequently in longitude 67 degrees 38\r\nminutes. A military expedition, undertaken by the commander of the\r\nfort of San Carlos, Don Francisco Bovadilla, to discover the sources\r\nof the Orinoco, led to some information respecting the cataracts of\r\nthe Guaharibos. Bovadilla had heard that some fugitive negroes from\r\nDutch Guiana, proceeding towards the west (beyond the isthmus between\r\nthe sources of the Rio Carony and the Rio Branco) had joined the\r\nindependent Indians. He attempted an entrada (hostile incursion)\r\nwithout having obtained the permission of the governor; the desire of\r\nprocuring African slaves, better fitted for labour than the\r\ncopper-coloured race, was a far more powerful motive than that of zeal\r\nfor the progress of geography. Bovadilla arrived without difficulty as\r\nfar as the little Raudal* opposite the Gehette (* It is called Raudal\r\nde abaxo (Low Cataract) in opposition to the great Raudal de\r\nGuaharibos, which is situated higher up toward the east.); but having\r\nadvanced to the foot of the rocky dike that forms the great cataract,\r\nhe was suddenly attacked, while he was breakfasting, by the Guaharibos\r\nand Guaycas, two warlike tribes, celebrated for the virulence of the\r\ncurare with which their arrows are empoisoned. The Indians occupied\r\nthe rocks that rise in the middle of the river, and seeing the\r\nSpaniards without bows, and having no knowledge of firearms, they\r\nprovoked the whites, whom they believed to be without defence. Several\r\nof the latter were dangerously wounded, and Bovadilla found himself\r\nforced to give the signal for battle. A fearful carnage ensued among\r\nthe natives, but none of the Dutch negroes, who, as was believed, had\r\ntaken refuge in those parts, were found. Notwithstanding a victory so\r\neasily won, the Spaniards did not dare to advance eastward in a\r\nmountainous country, and along a river inclosed by very high banks.\r\n\r\nThese white Guaharibos have constructed a bridge of lianas above the\r\ncataract, supported on rocks that rise, as generally happens in the\r\npongos of the Upper Maranon, in the middle of the river. The existence\r\nof this bridge, which is known to all the inhabitants of Esmeralda,*\r\nseems to indicate that the Orinoco must be very narrow at this point.\r\n(* The Amazon also is crossed twice on bridges of wood near its source\r\nin the lake Lauricocha; first north of Chavin, and then below the\r\nconfluence of the Rio Aguamiras. These, the only two bridges that have\r\nbeen thrown over the largest river we yet know, are called Puente de\r\nQuivilla, and Puente de Guancaybamba.) It is generally estimated by\r\nthe Indians to be only two or three hundred feet broad. They say that\r\nthe Orinoco, above the Raudal of the Guaharibos, is no longer a river,\r\nbut a brook (riachuelo); while a well informed ecclesiastic, Fray Juan\r\nGonzales, who had visited those countries, assured me that the\r\nOrinoco, in the part where its farther course is no longer known, is\r\ntwo-thirds of the breadth of the Rio Negro near San Carlos. This\r\nopinion appears to me hardly probable; but I relate what I have\r\ncollected, and affirm nothing positively.\r\n\r\nIn the rocky dike that crosses the Orinoco, forming the Raudal of the\r\nGuaharibos, Spanish soldiers pretend to have found the fine kind of\r\nsaussurite (Amazon-stone), of which we have spoken. This tradition\r\nhowever is very uncertain; and the Indians, whom I interrogated on the\r\nsubject, assured me that the green stones, called piedras de Macagua*\r\nat Esmeralda, were purchased from the Guaicas and Guaharibos, who\r\ntraffic with hordes much farther to the east. (* The etymology of this\r\nname, which is unknown to me, might lead to the knowledge of the spot\r\nwhere these stones are found. I have sought in vain the name of\r\nMacagua among the numerous tributary streams of the Tacutu, the Mahu,\r\nthe Rupunury, and the Rio Trombetas.) The same uncertainty prevails\r\nrespecting these stones, as that which attaches to many other valuable\r\nproductions of the Indies. On the coast, at the distance of some\r\nhundred leagues, the country where they are found is positively named;\r\nbut when the traveller with difficulty penetrates into that country,\r\nhe discovers that the natives are ignorant even of the name of the\r\nobject of his research. It might be supposed that the amulets of\r\nsaussurite found in the possession of the Indians of the Rio Negro,\r\ncome from the Lower Maranon, while those that are received by the\r\nmissions of the Upper Orinoco and the Rio Carony come from a country\r\nsituated between the sources of the Essequibo and the Rio Branco. The\r\nopinion that this stone is taken in a soft state like paste from the\r\nlittle lake Amucu, though very prevalent at Angostura, is wholly\r\nwithout foundation. A curious geognostic discovery remains to be made\r\nin the eastern part of America, that of finding in a primitive soil a\r\nrock of euphotide containing the piedra de Macagua.\r\n\r\nI shall here proceed to give some information respecting the tribes of\r\ndwarf and fair Indians, which ancient traditions have placed near the\r\nsources of the Orinoco. I had an opportunity of seeing some of these\r\nIndians at Esmeralda, and can affirm that the short stature of the\r\nGuaicas, and the fair complexion of the Guaharibos, whom Father Caulin\r\ncalls Guaribos blancos, have been alike exaggerated. The Guaicas, whom\r\nI measured, were in general from four feet seven inches to four feet\r\neight inches high (old measure of France).* (* About five feet three\r\ninches English measure.) We were assured that the whole tribe were of\r\nthis diminutive size; but we must not forget that what is called a\r\ntribe constitutes, properly speaking, but one family, owing to the\r\nexclusion of all foreign connections. The Indians of the lowest\r\nstature next to the Guaicas are the Guainares and the Poignaves. It is\r\nsingular, that all these nations are found in near proximity to the\r\nCaribs, who are remarkably tall. They all inhabit the same climate,\r\nand subsist on the same aliments. They are varieties in the race,\r\nwhich no doubt existed previously to the settlement of these tribes\r\n(tall and short, fair and dark brown) in the same country. The four\r\nnations of the Upper Orinoco, which appeared to me to be the fairest,\r\nare the Guaharibos of the Rio Gehette, the Guainares of the Ocamo, the\r\nGuaicas of Cano Chiguire, and the Maquiritares of the sources of the\r\nPadamo, the Jao, and the Ventuari. It being very extraordinary to see\r\nnatives with a fair skin beneath a burning sky, and amid nations of a\r\nvery dark hue, the Spaniards have attempted to explain this phenomenon\r\nby the following hypotheses. Some assert, that the Dutch of Surinam\r\nand the Rio Essequibo may have intermingled with the Guaharibos and\r\nthe Guainares; others insist, from hatred to the Capuchins of the\r\nCarony, and the Observantins of the Orinoco, that the fair Indians are\r\nwhat are called in Dalmatia muso di frate, children whose legitimacy\r\nis somewhat doubtful. In either case the Indios blancos would be\r\nmestizos, that is to say, children of an Indian woman and a white man.\r\nNow, having seen thousands of mestizos, I can assert that this\r\nsupposition is altogether inaccurate. The individuals of the fair\r\ntribes whom we examined, have the features, the stature, and the\r\nsmooth, straight, black hair which characterises other Indians. It\r\nwould be impossible to take them for a mixed race, like the\r\ndescendants of natives and Europeans. Some of these people are very\r\nlittle, others are of the ordinary stature of the copper-coloured\r\nIndians. They are neither feeble nor sickly, nor are they albinos; and\r\nthey differ from the copper-coloured races only by a much less tawny\r\nskin. It would be useless, after these considerations, to insist on\r\nthe distance of the mountains of the Upper Orinoco from the shores\r\ninhabited by the Dutch. I will not deny that descendants of fugitive\r\nnegroes may have been seen among the Caribs, at the sources of the\r\nEssequibo; but no white man ever went from the eastern coast to the\r\nRio Gehette and the Ocamo, in the interior of Guiana. It must also be\r\nobserved, although we may be struck with the singularity of several\r\nfair tribes being found at one point to the east of Esmeralda, it is\r\nno less certain, that tribes have been found in other parts of\r\nAmerica, distinguished from the neighbouring tribes by the less tawny\r\ncolour of their skin. Such are the Arivirianos and Maquiritares of the\r\nRio Ventuario and the Padamo, the Paudacotos and Paravenas of the\r\nErevato, the Viras and Araguas of the Caura, the Mologagos of Brazil,\r\nand the Guayanas of the Uruguay.* (* The Cumanagotos, the Maypures,\r\nthe Mapojos, and some hordes of the Tamanacs, are also fair, but in a\r\nless degree than the tribes I have just named. We may add to this list\r\n(which the researches of Sommering, Blumenbach, and Pritchard, on the\r\nvarieties of the human species, have rendered so interesting) the Ojes\r\nof the Cuchivero, the Boanes (now almost destroyed) of the interior of\r\nBrazil, and in the north of America, far from the north-west coast,\r\nthe Mandans and the Akanas (Walkenaer, Geogr. page 645. Gili volume 2\r\npage 34. Vater, Amerikan. Sprachen page 81. Southey volume 1 page\r\n603.) The most tawny, we might almost say the blackest of the American\r\nrace, are the Otomacs and the Guamos. These have perhaps given rise to\r\nthe confused notions of American negroes, spread through Europe in the\r\nearly times of the conquest. (Herrera Dec 1 lib 3 cap 9, volume 1 page\r\n79. Garcia, Origen de los Americanos page 259.) Who are those Negros\r\nde Quereca, placed by Gomara page 277, in that very isthmus of Panama,\r\nwhence we received the first absurd tales of an albino American\r\npeople? In reading with attention the authors of the beginning of the\r\n16th century, we see that the discovery of America and of a new race\r\nof men, had singularly awakened the interest of travellers respecting\r\nthe varieties of our species. Now, if a black race had been mingled\r\nwith copper-colored men, as in the South-sea Islands, the\r\nconquistadores would not have failed to speak of it in a precise\r\nmanner. Besides, the religious traditions of the Americans relate the\r\nappearance, in the heroic times, of white and bearded men as priests\r\nand legislators; but none of these traditions make mention of a black\r\nrace.)\r\n\r\nThese phenomena are so much the more worthy of attention as they are\r\nobserved in that great branch of the American nations generally ranked\r\nin a class totally opposite to that circumpolar branch, namely the\r\nTschougaz-Esquimaux,* whose children are fair, and who acquire the\r\nMongol or yellowish tint only from the influence of the air and the\r\nhumidity. (* The Chevalier Gieseke has recently confirmed all that\r\nKrantz related of the colour of the skin of the Esquimaux. That race\r\n(even in the latitude of seventy-five and seventy-six degrees, where\r\nthe climate is so rigorous) is not in general so diminutive as it was\r\nlong believed to be. Ross' Voyage to the North.) In Guiana, the hordes\r\nwho live in the midst of the thickest forests are generally less tawny\r\nthan those who inhabit the shores of the Orinoco, and are employed in\r\nfishing. But this slight difference, which is alike found in Europe\r\nbetween the artisans of towns and the cultivators of the fields or the\r\nfishermen on the coasts, in no way explains the problem of the Indios\r\nblancos. They are surrounded by other Indians of the woods (Indios del\r\nmonte) who are of a reddish-brown, although now exposed to the same\r\nphysical influences. The causes of these phenomena are very ancient,\r\nand we may repeat with Tacitus, \"est durans originis vis.\"\r\n\r\nThe fair-complexioned tribes, which we had an opportunity of seeing at\r\nthe mission of Esmeralda, inhabit part of a mountainous country lying\r\nbetween the sources of six tributaries of the Orinoco; that is to say,\r\nbetween the Padamo, the Jao, the Ventuari, the Erevato, the Aruy, and\r\nthe Paraguay.* (* They are six tributary streams on the right bank of\r\nthe Orinoco; the first three run towards the south, or the Upper\r\nOrinoco; the three others towards the north, or the Lower Orinoco.)\r\nThe Spanish and Portuguese missionaries are accustomed to designate\r\nthis country more particularly by the name of Parima.* (* The name\r\nParima, which signifies water, great water, is applied sometimes, and\r\nmore especially, to the land washed by the Rio Parima, or Rio Branco\r\n(Rio de Aguas Blancas), a stream running into the Rio Negro; sometimes\r\nto the mountains (Sierra Parima), which divide the Upper and Lower\r\nOrinoco.) Here, as in several other countries of Spanish America, the\r\nsavages have reconquered what had been wrested from them by\r\ncivilization, or rather by its precursors, the missionaries. The\r\nexpedition of the boundaries under Solano, and the extravagant zeal\r\ndisplayed by a governor of Guiana for the discovery of El Dorado,\r\npartially revived in the latter half of the eighteenth century that\r\nspirit of enterprise which characterised the Spaniards at the period\r\nof the discovery of America. In going along the Rio Padamo, a road was\r\nobserved across the forests and savannahs (the length of ten days'\r\njourney), from Esmeralda to the sources of the Ventuari; and in two\r\ndays more, from those sources, by the Erevato, the missions on the Rio\r\nCaura were reached. Two intelligent and enterprising men, Don Antonio\r\nSantos and Captain Bareto, had established, with the aid of the\r\nMiquiritares, a chain of military posts on this line from Esmeralda to\r\nthe Rio Erevato. These posts consisted of block-houses (casas\r\nfuertes), mounted with swivels, such as I have already mentioned. The\r\nsoldiers, left to themselves, exercised all kinds of vexations on the\r\nnatives (Indians of peace), who had cultivated pieces of ground around\r\nthe casas fuertes; and the consequence was that, in 1776, several\r\ntribes formed a league against the Spaniards. All the military posts\r\nwere attacked on the same night, on a line of nearly fifty leagues in\r\nlength. The houses were burnt, and many soldiers massacred; a very\r\nsmall number only owing their preservation to the pity of the Indian\r\nwomen. This nocturnal expedition is still mentioned with horror. It\r\nwas concerted in the most profound secrecy, and executed with that\r\nspirit of unity which the natives of America, skilled in concealing\r\ntheir hostile passions, well know how to practise in whatever concerns\r\ntheir common interests. Since 1776 no attempt has been made to\r\nre-establish the road which leads by land from the Upper to the Lower\r\nOrinoco, and no white man has been able to pass from Esmeralda to the\r\nErevato. It is certain, however, that in the mountainous lands,\r\nbetween the sources of the Padamo and the Ventuari (near the sites\r\ncalled by the Indians Aurichapa, Ichuana, and Irique) there are many\r\nspots where the climate is temperate, and where there are pasturages\r\ncapable of feeding numerous herds of cattle. The military posts were\r\nvery useful in preventing the incursions of the Caribs, who, from time\r\nto time carried off slaves, though in very small numbers, between the\r\nErevato and the Padamo. They would have resisted the attacks of the\r\nnatives, if, instead of leaving them isolated and solely to the\r\ncontrol of the soldiery, they had been formed into communities, and\r\ngoverned like the villages of neophyte Indians.\r\n\r\nWe left the mission of Esmeralda on the 23rd of May. Without being\r\npositively ill, we felt ourselves in a state of languor and weakness,\r\ncaused by the torment of insects, bad food, and a long voyage, in\r\nnarrow and damp boats. We did not go up the Orinoco beyond the mouth\r\nof the Rio Guapo, which we should have done, if we could have\r\nattempted to reach the sources of the river. There remains a distance\r\nof fifteen leagues from the Guapo to the Raudal of the Guaharibos. At\r\nthis cataract, which is passed on a bridge of lianas, Indians are\r\nposted armed with bows and arrows to prevent the whites, or those who\r\ncome from their territory from advancing westward. How could we hope\r\nto pass a point where the commander of the Rio Negro, Don Francisco\r\nBovadilla, was stopped when, accompanied by his soldiers, he tried to\r\npenetrate beyond the Gehette?* (* See above.) The carnage then made\r\namong the natives has rendered them more distrustful, and more averse\r\nto the inhabitants of the missions. It must be remembered that the\r\nOrinoco had hitherto offered to geographers two distinct problems,\r\nalike important, the situation of its sources, and the mode of its\r\ncommunication with the Amazon. The latter problem formed the object of\r\nthe journey which I have described; with respect to the discovery of\r\nits sources, that remains to be done by the Spanish and Portuguese\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nOur canoe was not ready to receive us till near three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. It had been filled with innumerable swarms of ants during\r\nthe navigation of the Cassiquiare; and the toldo, or roof of\r\npalm-leaves, beneath which we were again doomed to remain stretched\r\nout during twenty-two days, was with difficulty cleared of these\r\ninsects. We employed part of the morning in repeating to the\r\ninhabitants of Esmeralda the questions we had already put to them,\r\nrespecting the existence of a lake towards the east. We showed copies\r\nof the maps of Surville and La Cruz to old soldiers, who had been\r\nposted in the mission ever since its first establishment. They laughed\r\nat the supposed communication of the Orinoco with the Rio Idapa, and\r\nat the White Sea, which the former river was represented to cross.\r\nWhat we politely call geographical fictions they termed lies of the\r\nold world (mentiras de por alla). These good people could not\r\ncomprehend how men, in making the map of a country which they had\r\nnever visited, could pretend to know things in minute detail, of which\r\npersons who lived on the spot were ignorant. The lake Parima, the\r\nSierra Mey, and the springs which separate at the point where they\r\nissue from the earth, were entirely unknown at Esmeralda. We were\r\nrepeatedly assured that no one had ever been to the east of the Raudal\r\nof the Guaharibos; and that beyond that point, according to the\r\nopinion of some of the natives, the Orinoco descends like a small\r\ntorrent from a group of mountains, inhabited by the Coroto Indians.\r\nFather Gili, who was living on the banks of the Orinoco when the\r\nexpedition of the boundaries arrived, says expressly that Don\r\nApollinario Diez was sent in 1765 to attempt the discovery of the\r\nsource of the Orinoco; that he found the river, east of Esmeralda,\r\nfull of shoals; that he returned for want of provision; and that he\r\nlearned nothing, absolutely nothing, of the existence of a lake. This\r\nstatement perfectly accords with what I heard myself thirty-five years\r\nlater at Esmeralda. The probability of a fact is powerfully shaken\r\nwhen it can be proved to be totally unknown on the very spot where it\r\nought to be known best; and when those by whom the existence of the\r\nlake is affirmed contradict each other, not in the least essential\r\ncircumstances, but in all that are the most important.\r\n\r\nWhen travellers judge only by their own sensations they differ from\r\neach other respecting the abundance of the mosquitos as they do\r\nrespecting the progressive increase or diminution of the temperature.\r\nThe state of our organs, the motion of the air, its degree of humidity\r\nor dryness, its electric intensity, a thousand circumstances\r\ncontribute at once to make us suffer more or less from the heat and\r\nthe insects. My fellow travellers were unanimously of opinion that\r\nEsmeralda was more tormented by mosquitos than the banks of the\r\nCassiquiare, and even more than the two missions of the Great\r\nCataracts; whilst I, less sensible than they of the high temperature\r\nof the air, thought that the irritation produced by the insects was\r\nsomewhat less at Esmeralda than at the entrance of the Upper Orinoco.\r\nOn hearing the complaints that are made of these tormenting insects in\r\nhot countries it is difficult to believe that their absence, or rather\r\ntheir sudden disappearance, could become a subject of inquietude; yet\r\nsuch is the fact. The inhabitants of Esmeralda related to us, that in\r\nthe year 1795, an hour before sunset, when the mosquitos usually form\r\na very thick cloud, the air was observed to be suddenly free from\r\nthem. During the space of twenty minutes, not one insect was\r\nperceived, although the sky was cloudless, and no wind announced rain.\r\nIt is necessary to have lived in those countries to comprehend the\r\ndegree of surprise which the sudden disappearance of the insects must\r\nhave produced. The inhabitants congratulated each other, and inquired\r\nwhether this state of happiness, this relief from pain (feicidad y\r\nalivio), could be of any duration. But soon, instead of enjoying the\r\npresent, they yielded to chimerical fears, and imagined that the order\r\nof nature was perverted. Some old Indians, the sages of the place,\r\nasserted that the disappearance of the insects must be the precursor\r\nof a great earthquake. Warm discussions arose; the least noise amid\r\nthe foliage of the trees was listened to with an attentive ear; and\r\nwhen the air was again filled with mosquitos they were almost hailed\r\nwith pleasure. We could not guess what modification of the atmosphere\r\nhad caused this phenomenon, which must not be confounded with the\r\nperiodical replacing of one species of insects by another.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours' navigation down the Orinoco we arrived at the point\r\nof the bifurcation. Our resting place was on the same beach of the\r\nCassiquiare, where a few days previously our great dog had, as we\r\nbelieve, been carried off by the jaguars. All the endeavours of the\r\nIndians to discover any traces of the animal were fruitless. The cries\r\nof the jaguars were heard during the whole night.* (* This frequency\r\nof large jaguars is somewhat remarkable in a country destitute of\r\ncattle. The tigers of the Upper Orinoco are far less bountifully\r\nsupplied with prey than those of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres and the\r\nLlanos of Caracas, which are covered with herds of cattle. More than\r\nfour thousand jaguars are killed annually in the Spanish colonies,\r\nseveral of them equalling the mean size of the royal tiger of Asia.\r\nTwo thousand skins of jaguars were formerly exported annually from\r\nBuenos Ayres alone.) These animals are very frequent in the tracts\r\nsituated between the Cerro Maraguaca, the Unturan, and the banks of\r\nthe Pamoni. There also is found that black species of tiger* of which\r\nI saw some fine skins at Esmeralda. (* Gmelin, in his Synonyma, seems\r\nto confound this animal, under the name of Felis discolor, with the\r\ngreat American lion (Felis concolor) which is very different from the\r\npuma of the Andes of Quito.) This animal is celebrated for its\r\nstrength and ferocity; it appears to be still larger than the common\r\njaguar. The black spots are scarcely visible on the dark-brown ground\r\nof its skin. The Indians assert, that these tigers are very rare, that\r\nthey never mingle with the common jaguars, and that they form another\r\nrace. I believe that Prince Maximilian of Neuwied, who has enriched\r\nAmerican zoology by so many important observations, acquired the same\r\ninformation farther to the south, in the hot part of Brazil. Albino\r\nvarieties of the jaguar have been seen in Paraguay: for the spots of\r\nthese animals, which may be called the beautiful panthers of America,\r\nare sometimes so pale as to be scarcely distinguishable on a very\r\nwhite ground. In the black jaguars, on the contrary, it is the colour\r\nof the ground which renders the spots indistinct. It requires to\r\nreside long in those countries, and to accompany the Indians of\r\nEsmeralda in the perilous chase of the tiger, to decide with certainty\r\nupon the varieties and the species. In all the mammiferae, and\r\nparticularly in the numerous family of the apes, we ought, I believe,\r\nto fix our attention less on the transition from one colour to another\r\nin individuals, than on their habit of separating themselves, and\r\nforming distinct bands.\r\n\r\nWe left our resting place before sunrise on the 24th of May. In a\r\nrocky cove, which had been the dwelling of some Durimundi Indians, the\r\naromatic odour of the plants was so powerful, that although sleeping\r\nin the open air, and the irritability of our nervous system being\r\nallayed by the habits of a life of fatigue, we were nevertheless\r\nincommoded by it. We could not ascertain the flowers which diffused\r\nthis perfume. The forest was impenetrable; but M. Bonpland believed\r\nthat large clumps of pancratium and other liliaceous plants were\r\nconcealed in the neighbouring marshes. Descending the Orinoco by\r\nfavour of the current, we passed first the mouth of the Rio\r\nCunucunumo, and then the Guanami and the Puriname. The two banks of\r\nthe principal river are entirely desert; lofty mountains rise on the\r\nnorth, and on the south a vast plain extends far as the eye can reach\r\nbeyond the sources of the Atacavi, which lower down takes the name of\r\nthe Atabapo. There is something gloomy and desolate in this aspect of\r\na river, on which not even a fisherman's canoe is seen. Some\r\nindependent tribes, the Abirianos and the Maquiritares, dwell in the\r\nmountainous country; but in the neighbouring savannahs,* bounded by\r\nthe Cassiquiare, the Atabapo, the Orinoco, and the Rio Negro, there is\r\nnow scarcely any trace of a human habitation. (* They form a\r\nquadrilateral plot of a thousand square leagues, the opposite sides of\r\nwhich have contrary slopes, the Cassiquiare flowing towards the south,\r\nthe Atabapo towards the north, the Orinoco towards the north-west, and\r\nthe Rio Negro towards the south-east.) I say now; for here, as in\r\nother parts of Guiana, rude figures representing the sun, the moon,\r\nand different animals, traced on the hardest rocks of granite, attest\r\nthe anterior existence of a people, very different from those who\r\nbecame known to us on the banks of the Orinoco. According to the\r\naccounts of the natives, and of the most intelligent missionaries,\r\nthese symbolic signs resemble perfectly the characters we saw a\r\nhundred leagues more to the north, near Caycara, opposite the mouth of\r\nthe Rio Apure. (See Chapter 2.18 above.)\r\n\r\nIn advancing from the plains of the Cassiquiare and the Conorichite,\r\none hundred and forty leagues further eastward, between the sources of\r\nthe Rio Blanco and the Rio Essequibo, we also meet with rocks and\r\nsymbolical figures. I have lately verified this curious fact, which is\r\nrecorded in the journal of the traveller Hortsman, who went up the\r\nRupunuvini, one of the tributary streams of the Essequibo. Where this\r\nriver, full of small cascades, winds between the mountains of\r\nMacarana, he found, before he reached lake Amucu, rocks covered with\r\nfigures, or (as he says in Portuguese) with varias letras. We must not\r\ntake this word letters in its real signification. We were also shewn,\r\nnear the rock Culimacari, on the banks of the Cassiquiare, and at the\r\nport of Caycara in the Lower Orinoco, traces which were believed to be\r\nregular characters. They were however only misshapen figures,\r\nrepresenting the heavenly bodies, together with tigers, crocodiles,\r\nboas, and instruments used for making the flour of cassava. It was\r\nimpossible to recognize in these painted rocks* (the name by which the\r\nnatives denote those masses loaded with figures) any symmetrical\r\narrangement, or characters with regular spaces. (* In Tamanac\r\ntepumereme. (Tepu, a stone, rock; as in Mexican, tetl, a stone, and\r\ntepetl, a mountain; in Turco-Tatarian, tepe.) The Spanish Americans\r\nalso call the rock covered with sculptured figures, piedras pintadas;\r\nthose for instance, which are found on the summit of the Paramo of\r\nGuanacas, in New Grenada, and which recall to mind the tepumereme of\r\nthe Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rupunuvini.) The traces\r\ndiscovered in the mountains of Uruana, by the missionary Fray Ramon\r\nBueno, approach nearer to alphabetical writing; but are nevertheless\r\nvery doubtful.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the meaning of these figures, and with whatever view\r\nthey were traced upon granite, they merit the examination of those who\r\ndirect their attention to the philosophic history of our species. In\r\ntravelling from the coast of Caracas towards the equator, we are at\r\nfirst led to believe that monuments of this kind are peculiar to the\r\nmountain-chain of Encaramada; they are found at the port of Sedeno,\r\nnear Caycara,* (* In the Mountains of the Tyrant, Cerros del Tirano.)\r\nat San Rafael del Capuchino, opposite Cabruta, and in almost every\r\nplace where the granitic rock pierces the soil, in the savannah which\r\nextends from the Cerro Curiquima towards the banks of the Caura. The\r\nnations of the Tamanac race, the ancient inhabitants of those\r\ncountries, have a local mythology, and traditions connected with these\r\nsculptured rocks. Amalivaca, the father of the Tamanacs, that is, the\r\ncreator of the human race (for every nation regards itself as the root\r\nof all other nations), arrived in a bark, at the time of the great\r\ninundation, which is called the age of water,* when the billows of the\r\nocean broke against the mountains of Encaramada in the interior of the\r\nland. (* The Atonatiuh of the Mexicans, the fourth age, the fourth\r\nregeneration of the world.) All mankind, or, to speak more correctly,\r\nall the Tamanacs, were drowned, with the exception of one man and one\r\nwoman, who saved themselves on a mountain near the banks of the\r\nAsiveru, called Cuchivero by the Spaniards. This mountain is the\r\nArarat of the Aramean or Semitic nations, and the Tlaloc or Colhuacan\r\nof the Mexicans. Amalivaca, sailing in his bark, engraved the figures\r\nof the moon and the sun on the Painted Rock (Tepumereme) of\r\nEncaramada. Some blocks of granite piled upon one another, and forming\r\na kind of cavern, are still called the house or dwelling of the great\r\nforefather of the Tamanacs. The natives show also a large stone near\r\nthis cavern, in the plains of Maita, which they say was an instrument\r\nof music, the drum of Amalivaca. We must here observe, that this\r\nheroic personage had a brother, Vochi, who helped him to give the\r\nsurface of the earth its present form. The Tamanacs relate that the\r\ntwo brothers, in their system of perfectibility, sought, at first, to\r\narrange the Orinoco in such a manner, that the current of the water\r\ncould always be followed either going down or going up the river. They\r\nhoped by this means to spare men trouble in navigating rivers; but,\r\nhowever great the power of these regenerators of the world, they could\r\nnever contrive to give a double slope to the Orinoco, and were\r\ncompelled to relinquish this singular plan. Amalivaca had daughters,\r\nwho had a decided taste for travelling. The tradition states,\r\ndoubtless with a figurative meaning, that he broke their legs, to\r\nrender them sedentary, and force them to people the land of the\r\nTamanacs. After having regulated everything in America, on that side\r\nof the great water, Amalivaca again embarked, and returned to the\r\nother shore, to the same place from whence he came. Since the natives\r\nhave seen the missionaries arrive, they imagine that Europe is this\r\nother shore; and one of them inquired with great simplicity of Father\r\nGili, whether he had there seen the great Amalivaca, the father of the\r\nTamanacs, who had covered the rocks with symbolic figures.\r\n\r\nThese notions of a great convulsion of nature; of two human beings\r\nsaved on the summit of a mountain, and casting behind them the fruits\r\nof the mauritia palm-tree, to repeople the earth; of that national\r\ndivinity, Amalivaca, who arrived by water from a distant land, who\r\nprescribed laws to nature, and forced the nations to renounce their\r\nmigrations; these various features of a very ancient system of belief,\r\nare well worthy of attention. What the Tamanacs, and the tribes whose\r\nlanguages are analogous to the Tamanac tongue, now relate to us, they\r\nhave no doubt learned from other people, who inhabited before them the\r\nsame regions. The name of Amalivaca is spread over a region of more\r\nthan five thousand square leagues; he is found designated as the\r\nfather of mankind, or our great grandfather, as far as to the Caribbee\r\nnations, whose idiom approaches the Tamanac only in the same degree as\r\nthe German approaches the Greek, the Persian, and the Sanscrit.\r\nAmalivaca is not originally the Great Spirit, the Aged of Heaven, the\r\ninvisible being, whose worship springs from that of the powers of\r\nnature, when nations rise insensibly to the consciousness of the unity\r\nof these powers; he is rather a personage of the heroic times, a man,\r\nwho, coming from afar, lived in the land of the Tamanacs and the\r\nCaribs, sculptured symbolic figures upon the rocks, and disappeared by\r\ngoing back to the country he had previously inhabited beyond the\r\nocean. The anthropomorphism of the divinity has two sources\r\ndiametrically opposite; and this opposition seems to arise less from\r\nthe various degrees of intellectual culture, than from the different\r\ndispositions of nations, some of which are more inclined to mysticism,\r\nand others more governed by the senses, and by external impressions.\r\nSometimes man makes the divinities descend upon earth, charging them\r\nwith the care of ruling nations, and giving them laws, as in the\r\nfables of the East; sometimes, as among the Greeks and other nations\r\nof the West, they are the first monarchs, priest-kings, who are\r\nstripped of what is human in their nature, to be raised to the rank of\r\nnational divinities. Amalivaca was a stranger, like Manco-Capac,\r\nBochica, and Quetzalcohuatl; those extraordinary men, who, in the\r\nalpine or civilized part of America, on the tablelands of Peru, New\r\nGrenada, and Anahuac, organized civil society, regulated the order of\r\nsacrifices, and founded religious congregations. The Mexican\r\nQuetzalcohuatl, whose descendants Montezuma* (* The second king of\r\nthis name, of the race of Acamapitzin, properly called\r\nMontezuma-Ilhuicamina.) thought he recognized in the companions of\r\nCortez, displays an additional resemblance to Amalivaca, the\r\nmythologic personage of savage America or the plains of the torrid\r\nzone. When advanced in age, the high-priest of Tula left the country\r\nof Anahuac, which he had filled with his miracles, to return to an\r\nunknown region, called Tlalpallan. When the monk Bernard de Sahagun\r\narrived in Mexico, the same questions were put to him, as those which\r\nwere addressed to Father Gili two hundred years later, in the forests\r\nof the Orinoco; he was asked whether he came from the other shore (del\r\notro lado), from the countries to which Quetzalcohuatl had retired.\r\n\r\nThe region of sculptured rocks, or of painted stones, extends far\r\nbeyond the Lower Orinoco, beyond the country (latitude 7 degrees 5\r\nminutes to 7 degrees 40 minutes, longitude 68 degrees 50 minutes to 69\r\ndegrees 45 minutes) to which belongs what may be called the local\r\nfables of the Tamanacs. We again find these same sculptured rocks\r\nbetween the Cassiquiare and the Atabapo (latitude 2 degrees 5 minutes\r\nto 3 degrees 20 minutes; longitude 69 to 70 degrees); and between the\r\nsources of the Essequibo and the Rio Branco (latitude 3 degrees 50\r\nminutes; longitude 62 degrees 32 minutes). I do not assert that these\r\nfigures prove the knowledge of the use of iron, or that they denote a\r\nvery advanced degree of culture; but even on the supposition that,\r\ninstead of being symbolical, they are the fruits of the idleness of\r\nhunting nations, we must still admit an anterior race of men, very\r\ndifferent from those who now inhabit the banks of the Orinoco and the\r\nRupunuri. The more a country is destitute of remembrances of\r\ngenerations that are extinct, the more important it becomes to follow\r\nthe least traces of what appears to be monumental. The eastern plains\r\nof North America display only those extraordinary circumvallations\r\nthat remind us of the fortified camps (the pretended cities of vast\r\nextent) of the ancient and modern nomad tribes of Asia. In the\r\noriental plains of South America, the force of vegetation, the heat of\r\nthe climate, and the too lavish gifts of nature, have opposed\r\nobstacles still more powerful to the progress of human civilization.\r\nBetween the Orinoco and the Amazon I heard no mention of any wall of\r\nearth, vestige of a dyke, or sepulchral tumulus; the rocks alone show\r\nus (and this through a great extent of country), rude sketches which\r\nthe hand of man has traced in times unknown, and which are connected\r\nwith religious traditions.\r\n\r\nBefore I quitted the wildest part of the Upper Orinoco, I thought it\r\ndesirable to mention facts which are important only when they are\r\nconsidered in their connection with each other. All I could relate of\r\nour navigation from Esmeralda to the mouth of the Atabapo would be\r\nmerely an enumeration of rivers and uninhabited places. From the 24th\r\nto the 27th of May, we slept but twice on land; our first\r\nresting-place was at the confluence of the Rio Jao, and our second\r\nbelow the mission of Santa Barbara, in the island of Minisi. The\r\nOrinoco being free from shoals, the Indian pilot pursued his course\r\nall night, abandoning the boat to the current of the river. Setting\r\napart the time which we spent on the shore in preparing the rice and\r\nplantains that served us for food, we took but thirty-five hours in\r\ngoing from Esmeralda to Santa Barbara. The chronometer gave me for the\r\nlongitude of the latter mission 70 degrees 3 minutes; we had therefore\r\nmade near four miles an hour, a velocity which was partly owing to the\r\ncurrent, and partly to the action of the oars. The Indians assert that\r\nthe crocodiles do not go up the Orinoco above the mouth of the Rio\r\nJao, and that the manatees are not even found above the cataract of\r\nMaypures.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Santa Barbara is situated a little to the west of the\r\nmouth of the Rio Ventuari, or Venituari, examined in 1800 by Father\r\nFrancisco Valor. We found in this small village of one hundred and\r\ntwenty inhabitants some traces of industry; but the produce of this\r\nindustry is of little profit to the natives; it is reserved for the\r\nmonks, or, as they say in these countries, for the church and the\r\nconvent. We were assured that a great lamp of massive silver,\r\npurchased at the expense of the neophytes, is expected from Madrid.\r\nLet us hope that, after the arrival of this treasure, they will think\r\nalso of clothing the Indians, of procuring for them some instruments\r\nof agriculture, and assembling their children in a school. Although\r\nthere are a few oxen in the savannahs round the mission, they are\r\nrarely employed in turning the mill (trapiche), to express the juice\r\nof the sugar-cane; this is the occupation of the Indians, who work\r\nwithout pay here as they do everywhere when they are understood to\r\nwork for the church. The pasturages at the foot of the mountains round\r\nSanta Barbara are not so rich as at Esmeralda, but superior to those\r\nat San Fernando de Atabapo. The grass is short and thick, yet the\r\nupper stratum of earth furnishes only a dry and parched granitic sand.\r\nThe savannahs (far from fertile) of the banks of the Guaviare, the\r\nMeta, and the Upper Orinoco, are equally destitute of the mould which\r\nabounds in the surrounding forests, and of the thick stratum of clay,\r\nwhich covers the sandstone of the Llanos, or steppes of Venezuela. The\r\nsmall herbaceous mimosas contribute in this zone to fatten the cattle,\r\nbut are very rare between the Rio Jao and the mouth of the Guaviare.\r\n\r\nDuring the few hours of our stay at the mission of Santa Barbara, we\r\nobtained pretty accurate ideas respecting the Rio Ventuari, which,\r\nnext to the Guaviare, appeared to me to be the most considerable\r\ntributary of the Orinoco. Its banks, heretofore occupied by the\r\nMaypures, are still peopled by a great number of independent nations.\r\nOn going up by the mouth of the Ventuari, which forms a delta covered\r\nwith palm-trees, you find in the east, after three days' journey, the\r\nCumaruita and the Paru, two streams that rise at the foot of the lofty\r\nmountains of Cuneva. Higher up, on the west, lie the Mariata and the\r\nManipiare, inhabited by the Macos and Curacicanas. The latter nation\r\nis remarkable for their active cultivation of cotton. In a hostile\r\nincursion (entrada) a large house was found containing more than\r\nthirty or forty hammocks of a very fine texture of spun cotton,\r\ncordage, and fishing implements. The natives had fled; and Father\r\nValor informed us, that the Indians of the mission who accompanied him\r\nhad set fire to the house before he could save these productions of\r\nthe industry of the Curacicanas. The neophytes of Santa Barbara, who\r\nthink themselves very superior to these supposed savages, appeared to\r\nme far less industrious. The Rio Manipiare, one of the principal\r\nbranches of the Ventuari, approaches near its source those lofty\r\nmountains, the northern ridge of which gives birth to the Cuchivero.\r\nIt is a prolongation of the chain of Baraguan; and there Father Gili\r\nplaces the table-land of Siamacu, of which he vaunts the temperate\r\nclimate. The upper course of the Rio Ventuari, beyond the confluence\r\nof the Asisi, and the Great Raudales, is almost unknown. I was\r\ninformed only that the Upper Ventuari bends so much towards the east\r\nthat the ancient road from Esmeralda to the Rio Caura crosses the bed\r\nof the river. The proximity of the tributary streams of the Carony,\r\nthe Caura, and the Ventuari, has facilitated for ages the access of\r\nthe Caribs to the banks of the Upper Orinoco. Bands of this warlike\r\nand trading people went up from the Rio Carony, by the Paragua, to the\r\nsources of the Paruspa. A portage conducted them to the Chavarro, an\r\neastern tributary stream of the Rio Caura; they descended with their\r\ncanoes first this stream, and then the Caura itself as far as the\r\nmouth of the Erevato. After having gone up this last river south-west,\r\nand traversed vast savannahs for three days, they entered by the\r\nManipiare into the great Rio Ventuari. I trace this road with\r\nprecision not only because it was that by which the traffic of native\r\nslaves was carried on, but also to call the attention of those, who at\r\nsome future day may rule the destiny of Guiana, to the high importance\r\nof this labyrinth of rivers.\r\n\r\nIt is by the four largest tributary streams, which the majestic river\r\nof the Orinoco receives on the right (the Carony, the Caura, the\r\nPadamo, and the Ventuari), that European civilization will one day\r\npenetrate into this region of forests and mountains, which has a\r\nsurface of ten thousand six hundred square leagues, and which is\r\nbounded by the Orinoco on the north, the west, and the south. The\r\nCapuchins of Catalonia and the Observantins of Andalusia and Valencia,\r\nhave already made settlements in the valleys of the Carony and the\r\nCaura. The tributary streams of the Lower Orinoco, being the nearest\r\nto the coast and to the cultivated region of Venezuela, were naturally\r\nthe first to receive missionaries, and with them some germs of social\r\nlife. Corresponding to the Carony and the Caura, which flow toward the\r\nnorth, are two great tributary streams of the Upper Orinoco, that send\r\ntheir waters toward the south; these are the Padamo and the Ventuari.\r\nNo village has hitherto risen on their banks, though they offer\r\nadvantages for agriculture and pasturage, which would be sought in\r\nvain in the valley of the immense river to which they are tributary.\r\nIn the centre of these wild countries, where there will long be no\r\nother road than the rivers, every project of civilization should be\r\nfounded on an intimate knowledge of the hydraulic features of the\r\ncountry, and the relative importance of the tributary streams.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of the 26th of May we left the little village of Santa\r\nBarbara, where we found several Indians of Esmeralda, who had come\r\nreluctantly, by order of the missionary, to construct for him a house\r\nof two stories. During the whole day we enjoyed the view of the fine\r\nmountains of Sipapo, which rise at a distance of more than eighteen\r\nleagues in the direction of north-north-west. The vegetation of the\r\nbanks of the Orinoco is singularly varied in this part of the country;\r\nthe aborescent ferns* descend from the mountains, and mingle with the\r\npalm-trees of the plain. (* The geographical distribution of these\r\nplants is extremely singular. Scarcely any are found on the eastern\r\ncoast of Brazil. See the interesting work of Prince Maximilian of\r\nNeuwied, Reise nach Brasilien volume 1 page 274.) We rested that night\r\non the island of Minisi; and, after having passed the mouths of the\r\nlittle rivers Quejanuma, Ubua, and Masao, we arrived, on the 27th of\r\nMay, at San Fernando de Atabapo. We lodged in the same house which we\r\nhad occupied a month previously, when going up the Rio Negro. We then\r\ndirected our course towards the south, by the Atabapo and the Temi; we\r\nwere now returning from the west, having made a long circuit by the\r\nCassiquiare and the Upper Orinoco.\r\n\r\nWe remained only one day at San Fernando de Atabapo, although that\r\nvillage, adorned as it was by the pirijao palm-tree, with fruit like\r\npeaches, appeared to us a delicious abode. Tame pauxis* (* Not the\r\nourax of Cuvier, Crax pauxi Linn., but the Crax alector.) surrounded\r\nthe Indian huts; in one of which we saw a very rare monkey, which\r\ninhabits the banks of the Guaviare. This monkey is the caparro, which\r\nI have made known in my Observations on Zoology and comparative\r\nAnatomy; it forms, as Geoffroy believes, a new genus (Lagothrix)\r\nbetween the ateles and the alouates. The hair of this monkey is grey,\r\nlike that of the marten, and extremely soft to the touch. The caparro\r\nis distinguished by a round head, and a mild and agreeable expression\r\nof countenance. I believe the missionary Gili is the only author who\r\nhas made mention before me of this curious animal, around which\r\nzoologists begin to group other monkeys of Brazil. Having quitted San\r\nFernando on the 27th of May, we arrived, by help of the rapid current\r\nof the Orinoco, in seven hours, at the mouth of the Rio Mataveni. We\r\npassed the night in the open air, under the granitic rock El\r\nCastillito, which rises in the middle of the river, and the form of\r\nwhich reminded us of the ruin called the Mouse-tower (Mausethurm), on\r\nthe Rhine, opposite Bingen. Here, as on the banks of the Atabapo, we\r\nwere struck by the sight of a small species of drosera, having exactly\r\nthe appearance of the drosera of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco had sensibly swelled during the night; and the current,\r\nstrongly accelerated, bore us, in ten hours, from the mouth of the\r\nMataveni to the Upper Great Cataract, that of Maypures, or Quituna.\r\nThe distance which we passed over was thirteen leagues. We recalled to\r\nmind, with much satisfaction, the scenes where we had reposed in going\r\nup the river. We again found the Indians who had accompanied us in our\r\nherborizations; and we visited anew the fine spring that issues from a\r\nrock of stratified granite behind the house of the missionary: its\r\ntemperature was not changed more than 0.3 degrees. From the mouth of\r\nthe Atabapo as far as that of the Apure we seemed to be travelling as\r\nthrough a country which we had long inhabited. We were reduced to the\r\nsame abstinence; we were stung by the same mosquitos; but the\r\ncertainty of reaching in a few weeks the term of our physical\r\nsufferings kept up our spirits.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the canoe through the Great Cataract obliged us to stop\r\ntwo days at Maypures. Father Bernardo Zea, missionary at the Raudales,\r\nwho had accompanied us to the Rio Negro, though ill, insisted on\r\nconducting us with his Indians as far as Atures. One of these Indians,\r\nZerepe, the interpreter, who had been so unmercifully punished at the\r\nbeach of Pararuma, rivetted our attention by his appearance of deep\r\nsorrow. We learned that his grief was caused by the loss of a young\r\ngirl to whom he was engaged, and that he had lost her in consequence\r\nof false intelligence which had been spread respecting the direction\r\nof our journey. Zerepe, who was a native of Maypures, had been brought\r\nup in the woods by his parents, who were of the tribe of the Macos. He\r\nhad brought with him to the mission a girl of twelve years of age,\r\nwhom he intended to marry at our return from the Cataracts. The Indian\r\ngirl was little pleased with the life of the missions, and she was\r\ntold that the whites would go to the country of the Portuguese\r\n(Brazil), and would take Zerepe with them. Disappointed in her hopes,\r\nshe seized a boat, and with another girl of her own age, crossed the\r\nGreat Cataract, and fled al monte. The recital of this courageous\r\nadventure was the great news of the place. The affliction of Zerepe,\r\nhowever, was not of long duration. Born among the Christians, having\r\ntravelled as far as the foot of the Rio Negro, understanding Spanish\r\nand the language of the Macos, he thought himself superior to the\r\npeople of his tribe, and he no doubt soon forgot his forest love.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of May we passed the rapids of Guahibos and Garcita. The\r\nislands which rise in the middle of the waters of the river were\r\noverspread with the purest verdure. The rains of winter had unfolded\r\nthe spathes of the vadgiai palm-tree, the leaves of which rise\r\nstraight toward the sky. The eye is never wearied of the view of those\r\nscenes, where the trees and rocks give the landscape that grand and\r\nsevere character which we admire in the background of the pictures of\r\nSalvator Rosa. We landed before sunset on the eastern bank of the\r\nOrinoco, at the Puerto de la Expedicion, in order to visit the cavern\r\nof Ataruipe, which is the place of sepulchre of a whole nation\r\ndestroyed. I shall attempt to describe this cavern, so celebrated\r\namong the natives.\r\n\r\nWe climbed with difficulty, and not without some danger, a steep rock\r\nof granite, entirely bare. It would have been almost impossible to fix\r\nthe foot on its smooth and sloping surface, if large crystals of\r\nfeldspar, resisting decomposition, did not stand out from the rock,\r\nand furnish points of support. Scarcely had we attained the summit of\r\nthe mountain when we beheld with astonishment the singular aspect of\r\nthe surrounding country. The foamy bed of the waters is filled with an\r\narchipelago of islands covered with palm-trees. Westward, on the left\r\nbank of the Orinoco, the wide-stretching savannahs of the Meta and the\r\nCasanare resembled a sea of verdure. The setting sun seemed like a\r\nglobe of fire suspended over the plain, and the solitary Peak of\r\nUniana, which appeared more lofty from being wrapped in vapours which\r\nsoftened its outline, all contributed to augment the majesty of the\r\nscene. Immediately below us lay a deep valley, enclosed on every side.\r\nBirds of prey and goatsuckers winged their lonely flight in this\r\ninaccessible circus. We found a pleasure in following with the eye\r\ntheir fleeting shadows, as they glided slowly over the flanks of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nA narrow ridge led us to a neighbouring mountain, the rounded summit\r\nof which supported immense blocks of granite. These masses are more\r\nthan forty or fifty feet in diameter; and their form is so perfectly\r\nspherical, that, as they appear to touch the soil only by a small\r\nnumber of points, it might be supposed, at the least shock of an\r\nearthquake, they would roll into the abyss. I do not remember to have\r\nseen anywhere else a similar phenomenon, amid the decompositions of\r\ngranitic soils. If the balls rested on a rock of a different nature,\r\nas in the blocks of Jura, we might suppose that they had been rounded\r\nby the action of water, or thrown out by the force of an elastic\r\nfluid; but their position on the summit of a hill alike granitic,\r\nmakes it more probable that they owe their origin to the progressive\r\ndecomposition of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe most remote part of the valley is covered by a thick forest. In\r\nthis shady and solitary spot, on the declivity of a steep mountain,\r\nthe cavern of Ataruipe opens to the view. It is less a cavern than a\r\njutting rock in which the waters have scooped a vast hollow when, in\r\nthe ancient revolutions of our planet, they attained that height.* (*\r\nI saw no vein, no hole (four) filled with crystals. The decomposition\r\nof granitic rocks, and their separation into large masses, dispersed\r\nin the plains and valleys in the form of blocks and balls with\r\nconcentric layers, appear to favour the enlarging of these natural\r\nexcavations, which resemble real caverns.) In this tomb of a whole\r\nextinct tribe we soon counted nearly six hundred skeletons well\r\npreserved, and regularly placed. Every skeleton reposes in a sort of\r\nbasket made of the petioles of the palm-tree. These baskets, which the\r\nnatives call mapires, have the form of a square bag. Their size is\r\nproportioned to the age of the dead; there are some for infants cut\r\noff at the moment of their birth. We saw them from ten inches to three\r\nfeet four inches long, the skeletons in them being bent together. They\r\nare all ranged near each other, and are so entire that not a rib or a\r\nphalanx is wanting. The bones have been prepared in three different\r\nmanners, either whitened in the air and the sun, dyed red with anoto,\r\nor, like mummies, varnished with odoriferous resins, and enveloped in\r\nleaves of the heliconia or of the plantain-tree. The Indians informed\r\nus that the fresh corpse is placed in damp ground, that the flesh may\r\nbe consumed by degrees; some months afterwards it is taken out, and\r\nthe flesh remaining on the bones is scraped off with sharp stones.\r\nSeveral hordes in Guiana still observe this custom. Earthen vases\r\nhalf-baked are found near the mapires or baskets. They appear to\r\ncontain the bones of the same family. The largest of these vases, or\r\nfuneral urns, are five feet high, and three feet three inches long.\r\nTheir colour is greenish-grey, and their oval form is pleasing to the\r\neye. The handles are made in the shape of crocodiles or serpents; the\r\nedges are bordered with painted meanders, labyrinths, and grecques, in\r\nrows variously combined. Such designs are found in every zone among\r\nnations the farthest removed from each other, either with respect to\r\ntheir respective positions on the globe, or to the degree of\r\ncivilization which they have attained. They still adorn the common\r\npottery made by the inhabitants of the little mission of Maypures;\r\nthey ornament the bucklers of the Otaheitans, the fishing-implements\r\nof the Esquimaux, the walls of the Mexican palace of Mitla, and the\r\nvases of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nWe could not acquire any precise idea of the period to which the\r\norigin of the mapires and the painted vases, contained in the\r\nbone-cavern of Ataruipe, can be traced. The greater part seemed not to\r\nbe more than a century old; but it may be supposed that, sheltered\r\nfrom all humidity under the influence of a uniform temperature, the\r\npreservation of these articles would be no less perfect if their\r\norigin dated from a period far more remote. A tradition circulates\r\namong the Guahibos, that the warlike Atures, pursued by the Caribs,\r\nescaped to the rocks that rise in the middle of the Great Cataracts;\r\nand there that nation, heretofore so numerous, became gradually\r\nextinct, as well as its language. The last families of the Atures\r\nstill existed in 1767, in the time of the missionary Gili. At the\r\nperiod of our voyage an old parrot was shown at Maypures, of which the\r\ninhabitants said, and the fact is worthy of observation, that they did\r\nnot understand what it said, because it spoke the language of the\r\nAtures.\r\n\r\nWe opened, to the great concern of our guides, several mapires, for\r\nthe purpose of examining attentively the form of the skulls. They were\r\nall marked by the characteristics of the American race, with the\r\nexception of two or three, which approached indubitably to the\r\nCaucasian. In the middle of the Cataracts, in the most inaccessible\r\nspots, cases are found strengthened with iron bands, and filled with\r\nEuropean tools, vestiges of clothes, and glass trinkets. These\r\narticles, which have given rise to the most absurd reports of\r\ntreasures hidden by the Jesuits, probably belonged to Portuguese\r\ntraders who had penetrated into these savage countries. May we suppose\r\nthat the skulls of European race, which we saw mingled with the\r\nskeletons of the natives, and preserved with the same care, were the\r\nremains of some Portuguese travellers who had died of sickness, or had\r\nbeen killed in battle? The aversion evinced by the natives for\r\nwhatever is not of their own race renders this hypothesis little\r\nprobable. Perhaps fugitive mestizos of the missions of the Meta and\r\nApure may have come and settled near the Cataracts, marrying women of\r\nthe tribe of the Atures. Such mixed marriages sometimes take place in\r\nthis zone, though they are more rare than in Canada, and in the whole\r\nof North America, where hunters of European origin unite themselves\r\nwith savages, assume their habits, and sometimes acquire great\r\npolitical influence.\r\n\r\nWe took several skulls, the skeleton of a child of six or seven years\r\nold, and two of full-grown men of the nation of the Atures, from the\r\ncavern of Ataruipe. All these bones, partly painted red, partly\r\nvarnished with odoriferous resins, were placed in the baskets (mapires\r\nor canastos) which we have just described. They made almost the whole\r\nload of a mule; and as we knew the superstitious feelings of the\r\nIndians in reference to the remains of the dead after burial, we\r\ncarefully enveloped the canastos in mats recently woven. Unfortunately\r\nfor us, the penetration of the Indians, and the extreme quickness of\r\ntheir sense of smelling, rendered all our precautions useless.\r\nWherever we stopped, in the missions of the Caribbees, amid the\r\nLlanos, between Angostura and Nueva Barcelona, the natives assembled\r\nround our mules to admire the monkeys which we had purchased at the\r\nOrinoco. These good people had scarcely touched our baggage, when they\r\nannounced the approaching death of the beast of burden that carried\r\nthe dead. In vain we told them that they were deceived in their\r\nconjectures; and that the baskets contained the bones of crocodiles\r\nand manatees; they persisted in repeating that they smelt the resin\r\nthat surrounded the skeletons, and that they were their old relations.\r\nWe were obliged to request that the monks would interpose their\r\nauthority, to overcome the aversion of the natives, and procure for us\r\na change of mules.\r\n\r\nOne of the skulls, which we took from the cavern of Ataruipe, has\r\nappeared in the fine work published by my old master, Blumenbach, on\r\nthe varieties of the human species. The skeletons of the Indians were\r\nlost on the coast of Africa, together with a considerable part of our\r\ncollections, in a shipwreck, in which perished our friend and\r\nfellow-traveller, Fray Juan Gonzales, the young monk of the order of\r\nSaint Francis.\r\n\r\nWe withdrew in silence from the cavern of Ataruipe. It was one of\r\nthose calm and serene nights which are so common in the torrid zone.\r\nThe stars shone with a mild and planetary light. Their scintillation\r\nwas scarcely sensible at the horizon, which seemed illumined by the\r\ngreat nebulae of the southern hemisphere. An innumerable multitude of\r\ninsects spread a reddish light upon the ground, loaded with plants,\r\nand resplendent with these living and moving fires, as if the stars of\r\nthe firmament had sunk down on the savannah. On quitting the cavern we\r\nstopped several times to admire the beauty of this singular scene. The\r\nodoriferous vanilla and festoons of bignonia decorated the entrance;\r\nand above, on the summit of the hill, the arrowy branches of the\r\npalm-trees waved murmuring in the air. We descended towards the river,\r\nto take the road to the mission, where we arrived late in the night.\r\nOur imagination was struck by all we had just seen. Occupied\r\ncontinually by the present, in a country where the traveller is\r\ntempted to regard human society as a new institution, he is more\r\npowerfully interested by remembrances of times past. These\r\nremembrances were not indeed of a distant date; but in all that is\r\nmonumental antiquity is a relative idea, and we easily confound what\r\nis ancient with what is obscure and problematic. The Egyptians\r\nconsidered the historical remembrances of the Greeks as very recent.\r\nIf the Chinese, or, as they prefer calling themselves, the inhabitants\r\nof the Celestial Empire, could have communicated with the priests of\r\nHeliopolis, they would have smiled at those pretensions of the\r\nEgyptians to antiquity. Contrasts not less striking are found in the\r\nnorth of Europe and of Asia, in the New World, and in every region\r\nwhere the human race has not preserved a long consciousness of itself.\r\nThe migration of the Toltecs, the most ancient historical event on the\r\ntableland of Mexico, dates only in the sixth century of our era. The\r\nintroduction of a good system of intercalation, and the reform of the\r\ncalendars, the indispensable basis of an accurate chronology, took\r\nplace in the year 1091. These epochs, which to us appear so modern,\r\nfall on fabulous times, when we reflect on the history of our species\r\nbetween the banks of the Orinoco and the Amazon. We there see symbolic\r\nfigures sculptured on the rocks, but no tradition throws light upon\r\ntheir origin. In the hot part of Guiana we can go back only to the\r\nperiod when the Castilian and Portuguese conquerors, and more recently\r\npeaceful monks, penetrated amid so many barbarous nations.\r\n\r\nIt appears that to the north of the Cataracts, in the strait of\r\nBaraguan, there are caverns filled with bones, similar to those I have\r\njust described: but I was informed of this fact only after my return;\r\nour Indian pilots did not mention it when we landed at the strait.\r\nThese tombs no doubt have given rise to a fable of the Ottomacs,\r\naccording to which the granitic and solitary rocks of Baraguan, the\r\nforms of which are very singular, are regarded as the grandfathers,\r\nthe ancient chiefs of the tribe. The custom of separating the flesh\r\nfrom the bones, very anciently practised by the Massagetes, is still\r\nknown among several hordes of the Orinoco. It is even asserted, and\r\nwith some probability, that the Guaraons plunge their dead bodies\r\nunder water enveloped in nets; and that the small caribe-fishes, of\r\nwhich we saw everywhere an innumerable quantity, devour in a few days\r\nthe muscular flesh, and thus prepare the skeleton. It may be supposed\r\nthat this operation can be practised only in places where crocodiles\r\nare not common. Some tribes, for instance the Tamanacs, are accustomed\r\nto lay waste the fields of a deceased relative, and cut down the trees\r\nwhich he has planted. They say that the sight of objects which\r\nbelonged to their relation makes them melancholy. They like better to\r\nefface than to preserve remembrances. These effects of Indian\r\nsensibility are very detrimental to agriculture, and the monks oppose\r\nwith energy these superstitious practices, to which the natives\r\nconverted to Christianity still adhere in the missions.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of the Indians of the Orinoco have not been very closely\r\nexamined, because they do not contain valuable articles like those of\r\nPeru; and even on the spot no faith is now lent to the chimerical\r\nideas, which were heretofore formed of the wealth of the ancient\r\ninhabitants of El Dorado. The thirst of gold everywhere precedes the\r\ndesire of instruction, and a taste for researches into antiquity; in\r\nall the mountainous part of South America, from Merida and Santa\r\nMartha to the table-lands of Quito and Upper Peru, the labours of\r\nabsolute mining have been undertaken to discover tombs, or, as the\r\nCreoles say, employing a word altered from the Inca language, guacas.\r\nWhen in Peru, at Mancichi, I went into the guaca from which, in the\r\nsixteenth century, masses of gold of great value were extracted. No\r\ntrace of the precious metals has been found in the caverns which have\r\nserved the natives of Guiana for ages as sepulchres. This circumstance\r\nproves that even at the period when the Caribs, and other travelling\r\nnations, made incursions to the south-west, gold had flowed in very\r\nsmall quantities from the mountains of Peru towards the eastern\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nWherever the granitic rocks do not present any of those large cavities\r\ncaused by their decomposition, or by an accumulation of their blocks,\r\nthe Indians deposit their dead in the earth. The hammock (chinchorro),\r\na kind of net in which the deceased had reposed during his life,\r\nserves for a coffin. This net is fastened tight round the body, a hole\r\nis dug in the hut, and there the body is laid. This is the most usual\r\nmethod, according to the account of the missionary Gili, and it\r\naccords with what I myself learned from Father Zea. I do not believe\r\nthat there exists one tumulus in Guiana, not even in the plains of the\r\nCassiquiare and the Essequibo. Some, however, are to be met with in\r\nthe savannahs of Varinas, as in Canada, to the west of the\r\nAlleghenies.* (* Mummies and skeletons contained in baskets were\r\nrecently discovered in a cavern in the United States. It is believed\r\nthey belong to a race of men analogous to that of the Sandwich\r\nIslands. The description of these tombs has some similitude with that\r\nof the tombs of Ataruipe.) It seems remarkable enough that,\r\nnotwithstanding the extreme abundance of wood in those countries, the\r\nnatives of the Orinoco were as little accustomed as the ancient\r\nScythians to burn the dead. Sometimes they formed funeral piles for\r\nthat purpose; but only after a battle, when the number of the dead was\r\nconsiderable. In 1748, the Parecas burned not only the bodies of their\r\nenemies, the Tamanacs, but also those of their own people who fell on\r\nthe field of battle. The Indians of South America, like all nations in\r\na state of nature, are strongly attached to the spots where the bones\r\nof their fathers repose. This feeling, which a great writer has\r\nbeautifully painted in the episode of Atala, is cherished in all its\r\nprimitive ardour by the Chinese. These people among whom everything is\r\nthe produce of art, or rather of the most ancient civilization, do not\r\nchange their dwelling without carrying along with them the bones of\r\ntheir ancestors. Coffins are seen deposited on the banks of great\r\nrivers, to be transported, with the furniture of the family, to a\r\nremote province. These removals of bones, heretofore more common among\r\nthe savages of North America, are not practised among the tribes of\r\nGuiana; but these are not nomad, like nations who live exclusively by\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at the mission of Atures only during the time necessary for\r\npassing the canoe through the Great Cataract. The bottom of our frail\r\nbark had become so thin that it required great care to prevent it from\r\nsplitting. We took leave of the missionary, Bernardo Zea, who remained\r\nat Atures, after having accompanied us during two months, and shared\r\nall our sufferings. This poor monk still continued to have fits of\r\ntertian ague; they had become to him an habitual evil, to which he\r\npaid little attention. Other fevers of a more fatal kind prevailed at\r\nAtures on our second visit. The greater part of the Indians could not\r\nleave their hammocks, and we were obliged to send in search of\r\ncassava-bread, the most indispensable food of the country, to the\r\nindependent but neighbouring tribe of the Piraoas. We had hitherto\r\nescaped these malignant fevers, which I believe to be always\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\nWe ventured to pass in our canoe through the latter half of the Raudal\r\nof Atures. We landed here and there, to climb upon the rocks, which\r\nlike narrow dikes joined the islands to one another. Sometimes the\r\nwaters force their way over the dikes, sometimes they fall within them\r\nwith a hollow noise. A considerable portion of the Orinoco was dry,\r\nbecause the river had found an issue by subterraneous caverns. In\r\nthese solitary haunts the rock-manakin with gilded plumage (Pipra\r\nrupicola), one of the most beautiful birds of the tropics, builds its\r\nnest. The Raudalito of Carucari is caused by an accumulation of\r\nenormous blocks of granite, several of which are spheroids of five or\r\nsix feet in diameter, and they are piled together in such a manner, as\r\nto form spacious caverns. We entered one of these caverns to gather\r\nthe confervas that were spread over the clefts and humid sides of the\r\nrock. This spot displayed one of the most extraordinary scenes of\r\nnature that we had contemplated on the banks of the Orinoco. The river\r\nrolled its waters turbulently over our heads. It seemed like the sea\r\ndashing against reefs of rocks; but at the entrance of the cavern we\r\ncould remain dry beneath a large sheet of water that precipitated\r\nitself in an arch from above the barrier. In other cavities, deeper,\r\nbut less spacious, the rock was pierced by the effect of successive\r\nfiltrations. We saw columns of water, eight or nine inches broad,\r\ndescending from the top of the vault, and finding an issue by clefts,\r\nthat seemed to communicate at great distances with each other.\r\n\r\nThe cascades of Europe, forming only one fall, or several falls close\r\nto each other, can never produce such variety in the shifting\r\nlandscape. This variety is peculiar to rapids, to a succession of\r\nsmall cataracts several miles in length, to rivers that force their\r\nway across rocky dikes and accumulated blocks of granite. We had the\r\nopportunity of viewing this extraordinary sight longer than we wished.\r\nOur boat was to coast the eastern bank of a narrow island, and to take\r\nus in again after a long circuit. We passed an hour and a half in vain\r\nexpectation of it. Night approached, and with it a tremendous storm.\r\nIt rained with violence. We began to fear that our frail bark had been\r\nwrecked against the rocks, and that the Indians, conformably to their\r\nhabitual indifference for the evils of others, had returned tranquilly\r\nto the mission. There were only three of us: we were completely wet,\r\nand uneasy respecting the fate of our boat: it appeared far from\r\nagreeable to pass, without sleep, a long night of the torrid zone amid\r\nthe noise of the Raudales. M. Bonpland proposed to leave me in the\r\nisland with Don Nicolas Soto, and to swim across the branches of the\r\nriver that are separated by the granitic dikes. He hoped to reach the\r\nforest, and seek assistance at Atures from Father Zea. We dissuaded\r\nhim with difficulty from undertaking this hazardous enterprise. He\r\nknew little of the labyrinth of small channels, into which the Orinoco\r\nis divided. Most of them have strong whirlpools, and what passed\r\nbefore our eyes while we were deliberating on our situation, proved\r\nsufficiently that the natives had deceived us respecting the absence\r\nof crocodiles in the cataracts. The little monkeys which we had\r\ncarried along with us for months were deposited on the point of our\r\nisland. Wet by the rains and sensible of the least lowering of the\r\ntemperature, these delicate animals sent forth plaintive cries, and\r\nattracted to the spot two crocodiles, the size and leaden colour of\r\nwhich denoted their great age. Their unexpected appearance made us\r\nreflect on the danger we had incurred by bathing, at our first passing\r\nby the mission of Atures, in the middle of the Raudal. After long\r\nwaiting, the Indians at length arrived at the close of day. The\r\nnatural coffer-dam by which they had endeavoured to descend in order\r\nto make the circuit of the island, had become impassable owing to the\r\nshallowness of the water. The pilot sought long for a more accessible\r\npassage in this labyrinth of rocks and islands. Happily our canoe was\r\nnot damaged and in less than half an hour our instruments, provision,\r\nand animals, were embarked.\r\n\r\nWe pursued our course during a part of the night, to pitch our tent\r\nagain in the island of Panumana. We recognized with pleasure the spots\r\nwhere we had botanized when going up the Orinoco. We examined once\r\nmore on the beach of Guachaco that small formation of sandstone, which\r\nreposes directly on granite. Its position is the same as that of the\r\nsandstone which Burckhardt observed at the entrance of Nubia,\r\nsuperimposed on the granite of Syene. We passed, without visiting it,\r\nthe new mission of San Borga, where (as we learned with regret a few\r\ndays after) the little colony of Guahibos had fled al monte, from the\r\nchimerical fear that we should carry them off; to sell them as poitos,\r\nor slaves. After having passed the rapids of Tabaje, and the Raudal of\r\nCariven, near the mouth of the great Rio Meta, we arrived without\r\naccident at Carichana. The missionary received us with that kind\r\nhospitality which he extended to us on our first passage. The sky was\r\nunfavourable for astronomical observations; we had obtained some new\r\nones in the two Great Cataracts; but thence, as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Apure, we were obliged to renounce the attempt. M. Bonpland had\r\nthe satisfaction at Carichana of dissecting a manatee more than nine\r\nfeet long. It was a female, and the flesh appeared to us not\r\nunsavoury. I have spoken in another place of the manner of catching\r\nthis herbivorous cetacea. The Piraoas, some families of whom inhabit\r\nthe mission of Carichana, detest this animal to such a degree, that\r\nthey hid themselves, to avoid being obliged to touch it, whilst it was\r\nbeing conveyed to our hut. They said that the people of their tribe\r\ndie infallibly when they eat of it. This prejudice is the more\r\nsingular, as the neighbours of the Piraoas, the Guamos and the\r\nOttomacs, are very fond of the flesh of the manatee. The flesh of the\r\ncrocodile is also an object of horror to some tribes, and of\r\npredilection to others.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cuba furnishes a fact little known in the history of the\r\nmanatee. South of the port of Xagua, several miles from the coast,\r\nthere are springs of fresh water in the middle of the sea. They are\r\nsupposed to be owing to a hydrostatic pressure existing in\r\nsubterraneous channels, communicating with the lofty mountains of\r\nTrinidad. Small vessels sometimes take in water there; and, what is\r\nwell worthy of observation, large manatees remain habitually in those\r\nspots. I have already called the attention of naturalists to the\r\ncrocodiles which advance from the mouth of rivers far into the sea.\r\nAnalogous circumstances may have caused, in the ancient catastrophes\r\nof our planet, that singular mixture of pelagian and fluviatile bones\r\nand petrifactions, which is observed in some rocks of recent\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nOur stay at Carichana was very useful in recruiting our strength after\r\nour fatigues. M. Bonpland bore with him the germs of a cruel malady;\r\nhe needed repose; but as the delta of the tributary streams included\r\nbetween the Horeda and Paruasi is covered with a rich vegetation, he\r\nmade long herbalizations, and was wet through several times in a day.\r\nWe found, fortunately, in the house of the missionary, the most\r\nattentive care; we were supplied with bread made of maize flour, and\r\neven with milk. The cows yield milk plentifully enough in the lower\r\nregions of the torrid zone, wherever good pasturage is found. I call\r\nattention to this fact, because local circumstances have spread\r\nthrough the Indian Archipelago the prejudice of considering hot\r\nclimates as repugnant to the secretion of milk. We may conceive the\r\nindifference of the inhabitants of the New World for a milk diet, the\r\ncountry having been originally destitute of animals capable of\r\nfurnishing it*; (* The reindeer are not domesticated in Greenland as\r\nthey are in Lapland; and the Esquimaux care little for their milk. The\r\nbisons taken very young accustom themselves, on the west of the\r\nAlleghenies, to graze with herds of European cows. The females in some\r\ndistricts of India yield a little milk, but the natives have never\r\nthought of milking them. What is the origin of that fabulous story\r\nrelated by Gomara (chapter 43 page 36) according to which the first\r\nSpanish navigators saw, on the coast of South Carolina, stags led to\r\nthe savannahs by herdsmen? The female bisons, according to Mr.\r\nBuchanan and the philosophical historian of the Indian Archipelago,\r\nMr. Crawford, yield more milk than common cows.) but how can we avoid\r\nbeing astonished at this indifference in the immense Chinese\r\npopulation, living in great part beyond the tropics, and in the same\r\nlatitude with the nomad and pastoral tribes of central Asia? If the\r\nChinese have ever been a pastoral people, how have they lost the\r\ntastes and habits so intimately connected with that state, which\r\nprecedes agricultural institutions? These questions are interesting\r\nwith respect both to the history of the nations of oriental Asia, and\r\nto the ancient communications that are supposed to have existed\r\nbetween that part of the world and the north of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe went down the Orinoco in two days, from Carichana to the mission of\r\nUruana, after having again passed the celebrated strait of Baraguan.\r\nWe stopped several times to determine the velocity of the river, and\r\nits temperature at the surface, which was 27.4 degrees. The velocity\r\nwas found to be two feet in a second (sixty-two toises in 3 minutes 6\r\nseconds) in places where the bed of the Orinoco was more than twelve\r\nthousand feet broad, and from ten to twelve fathoms deep. The slope of\r\nthe river is in fact extremely gentle from the Great Cataracts to\r\nAngostura; and, if a barometric measurement were wanting, the\r\ndifference of height might be determined by approximation, by\r\nmeasuring from time to time the velocity of the stream, and the extent\r\nof the section in breadth and depth. We had some observations of the\r\nstars at Uruana. I found the latitude of the mission to be 7 degrees 8\r\nminutes; but the results from different stars left a doubt of more\r\nthan 1 minute. The stratum of mosquitos, which hovered over the\r\nground, was so thick that I could not succeed in rectifying properly\r\nthe artificial horizon. I tormented myself in vain; and regretted that\r\nI was not provided with a mercurial horizon. On the 7th of June, good\r\nabsolute altitudes of the sun gave me 69 degrees 40 minutes for the\r\nlongitude. We had advanced from Esmeralda 1 degree 17 minutes toward\r\nthe west, and this chronometric determination merits entire confidence\r\non account of the double observations, made in going and returning, at\r\nthe Great Cataracts, and at the confluence of the Atabapo and of the\r\nApure.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the mission of Uruana is extremely picturesque. The\r\nlittle Indian village stands at the foot of a lofty granitic mountain.\r\nRocks everywhere appear in the form of pillars above the forest,\r\nrising higher than the tops of the tallest trees. The aspect of the\r\nOrinoco is nowhere more majestic than when viewed from the hut of the\r\nmissionary, Fray Ramon Bueno. It is more than two thousand six hundred\r\ntoises broad, and it runs without any winding, like a vast canal,\r\nstraight toward the east. Two long and narrow islands (Isla de Uruana\r\nand Isla vieja de la Manteca) contribute to give extent to the bed of\r\nthe river; the two banks are parallel, and we cannot call it divided\r\ninto different branches. The mission is inhabited by the Ottomacs, a\r\ntribe in the rudest state, and presenting one of the most\r\nextraordinary physiological phenomena. They eat earth; that is, they\r\nswallow every day, during several months, very considerable\r\nquantities, to appease hunger, and this practice does not appear to\r\nhave any injurious effect on their health. Though we could stay only\r\none day at Uruana, this short space of time sufficed to make us\r\nacquainted with the preparation of the poya, or balls of earth. I also\r\nfound some traces of this vitiated appetite among the Guamos; and\r\nbetween the confluence of the Meta and the Apure, where everybody\r\nspeaks of dirt-eating as of a thing anciently known. I shall here\r\nconfine myself to an account of what we ourselves saw or heard from\r\nthe missionary, who had been doomed to live for twelve years among the\r\nsavage and turbulent tribe of the Ottomacs.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Uruana belong to those nations of the savannahs\r\ncalled wandering Indians (Indios andantes) who, more difficult to\r\ncivilize than the nations of the forest (Indios del monte), have a\r\ndecided aversion to cultivate the land, and live almost exclusively by\r\nhunting and fishing. They are men of very robust constitution; but\r\nill-looking, savage, vindictive, and passionately fond of fermented\r\nliquors. They are omnivorous animals in the highest degree; and\r\ntherefore the other Indians, who consider them as barbarians, have a\r\ncommon saying, nothing is so loathsome but that an Ottomac will eat\r\nit. While the waters of the Orinoco and its tributary streams are low,\r\nthe Ottomacs subsist on fish and turtles. The former they kill with\r\nsurprising dexterity, by shooting them with an arrow when they appear\r\nat the surface of the water. When the rivers swell fishing almost\r\nentirely ceases.* (* In South America, as in Egypt and Nubia, the\r\nswelling of the rivers, which occurs periodically in every part of the\r\ntorrid zone, is erroneously attributed to the melting of the snows.)\r\nIt is then very difficult to procure fish, which often fails the poor\r\nmissionaries, on fast-days as well as flesh-days, though all the young\r\nIndians are under the obligation of fishing for the convent. During\r\nthe period of these inundations, which last two or three months, the\r\nOttomacs swallow a prodigious quantity of earth. We found heaps of\r\nearth-balls in their huts, piled up in pyramids three or four feet\r\nhigh. These balls were five or six inches in diameter. The earth which\r\nthe Ottomacs eat is a very fine and unctuous clay of a yellowish grey\r\ncolour; and, when being slightly baked at the fire, the hardened crust\r\nhas a tint inclining to red, owing to the oxide of iron which is\r\nmingled with it. We brought away some of this earth, which we took\r\nfrom the winter-provision of the Indians; and it is a mistake to\r\nsuppose that it is steatitic, and that it contains magnesia. Vauquelin\r\ndid not discover any traces of that substance in it but he found that\r\nit contained more silex than alumina, and three or four per cent of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\nThe Ottomacs do not eat every kind of clay indifferently; they choose\r\nthe alluvial beds or strata, which contain the most unctuous earth,\r\nand the smoothest to the touch. I inquired of the missionary whether\r\nthe moistened clay were made to undergo that peculiar decomposition\r\nwhich is indicated by a disengagement of carbonic acid and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, and which is designated in every language by\r\nthe term of putrefaction; but he assured us that the natives neither\r\ncause the clay to rot, nor do they mingle it with flour of maize, oil\r\nof turtle's eggs, or fat of the crocodile. We ourselves examined, both\r\nat the Orinoco and after our return to Paris, the balls of earth which\r\nwe brought away with us, and found no trace of the mixture of any\r\norganic substance, whether oily or farinaceous. The savage regards\r\nevery thing as nourishing that appeases hunger: when, therefore, you\r\ninquire of an Ottomac on what he subsists during the two months when\r\nthe river is at its highest flood he shows you his balls of clayey\r\nearth. This he calls his principal food at the period when he can\r\nseldom procure a lizard, a root of fern, or a dead fish swimming at\r\nthe surface of the water. If necessity force the Indians to eat earth\r\nduring two months (and from three quarters to five quarters of a pound\r\nin twenty-four hours), he eats it from choice during the rest of the\r\nyear. Every day in the season of drought, when fishing is most\r\nabundant, he scrapes his balls of poya, and mingles a little clay with\r\nhis other aliment. It is most surprising that the Ottomacs do not\r\nbecome lean by swallowing such quantities of earth: they are, on the\r\ncontrary, extremely robust. The missionary Fray Ramon Bueno asserts\r\nthat he never remarked any alteration in the health of the natives at\r\nthe period of the great risings of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe Ottomacs during some months eat daily three-quarters of a pound of\r\nclay slightly hardened by fire, but which they moisten before\r\nswallowing it. It has not been possible to verify hitherto with\r\nprecision how much nutritious vegetable or animal matter they take in\r\na week at the same time; but they attribute the sensation of satiety\r\nwhich they feel to the clay, and not to the wretched aliments which\r\nthey take with it occasionally.\r\n\r\nNo physiological phenomenon being entirely insulated, it may be\r\ninteresting to examine several analogous phenomena, which I have been\r\nable to collect. I observed everywhere within the torrid zone, in a\r\ngreat number of individuals, children, women, and sometimes even\r\nfull-grown men, an inordinate and almost irresistible desire of\r\nswallowing earth; not an alkaline or calcareous earth to neutralize\r\n(as it is said) acid juices, but a fat clay, unctuous, and exhaling a\r\nstrong smell. It is often found necessary to tie the children's hands\r\nor to confine them to prevent them eating earth when the rain ceases\r\nto fall. At the village of Banco, on the bank of the river Magdalena,\r\nI saw the Indian women who make pottery continually swallowing great\r\npieces of clay. These women were not in a state of pregnancy; and they\r\naffirmed that earth is an aliment which they do not find hurtful. In\r\nother American tribes, people soon fall sick, and waste away, when\r\nthey yield too much to this mania of eating earth. We found at the\r\nmission of San Borja an Indian child of the Guahiba nation, who was as\r\nthin as a skeleton. The mother informed us that the little girl was\r\nreduced to this lamentable state of atrophy in consequence of a\r\ndisordered appetite, she having refused during four months to take\r\nalmost any other food than clay. Yet San Borja is only twenty-five\r\nleagues distant from the mission of Uruana, inhabited by that tribe of\r\nthe Ottomacs, who, from the effect no doubt of a habit progressively\r\nacquired, swallow the poya without experiencing any pernicious\r\neffects. Father Gumilla asserts that the Ottomacs take as an aperient,\r\noil, or rather the melted fat of the crocodile, when they feel any\r\ngastric obstructions; but the missionary whom we found among them was\r\nlittle disposed to confirm this assertion. It may be asked, why the\r\nmania of eating earth is much more rare in the frigid and temperate\r\nthan in the torrid zones; and why in Europe it is found only among\r\nwomen in a state of pregnancy, and sickly children. This difference\r\nbetween hot and temperate climates arises perhaps only from the inert\r\nstate of the functions of the stomach caused by strong cutaneous\r\nperspiration. It has been supposed to be observed that the inordinate\r\ntaste for eating earth augments among the African slaves, and becomes\r\nmore pernicious when they are restricted to a regimen purely vegetable\r\nand deprived of spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nThe negroes on the coast of Guinea delight in eating a yellowish\r\nearth, which they call caouac. The slaves who are taken to America\r\nendeavour to indulge in this habit; but it proves detrimental to their\r\nhealth. They say that the earth of the West Indies is not so easy of\r\ndigestion as that of their country. Thibaut de Chanvalon, in his\r\nVoyage to Martinico, expresses himself very judiciously on this\r\npathological phenomenon. \"Another cause,\" he says, \"of this pain in\r\nthe stomach is that several of the negroes, who come from the coast of\r\nGuinea, eat earth; not from a depraved taste, or in consequence of\r\ndisease, but from a habit contracted at home in Africa, where they\r\neat, they say, a particular earth, the taste of which they find\r\nagreeable, without suffering any inconvenience. They seek in our\r\nislands for the earth most similar to this, and prefer a yellowish red\r\nvolcanic tufa. It is sold secretly in our public markets; but this is\r\nan abuse which the police ought to correct. The negroes who have this\r\nhabit are so fond of caouac, that no chastisement will prevent their\r\neating it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Archipelago, at the island of Java, Labillardiere saw,\r\nbetween Surabaya and Samarang, little square and reddish cakes exposed\r\nfor sale. These cakes called tanaampo, were cakes of clay, slightly\r\nbaked, which the natives eat with relish. The attention of\r\nphysiologists, since my return from the Orinoco, having been\r\npowerfully directed to these phenomena of geophagy, M. Leschenault\r\n(one of the naturalists of the expedition to the Antarctic regions\r\nunder the command of captain Baudin) has published some curious\r\ndetails on the tanaampo, or ampo, of the Javanese. \"The reddish and\r\nsomewhat ferruginous clay,\" he says \"which the inhabitants of Java are\r\nfond of eating occasionally, is spread on a plate of iron, and baked,\r\nafter having been rolled into little cylinders in the form of the bark\r\nof cinnamon. In this state it takes the name of ampo, and is sold in\r\nthe public markets. This clay has a peculiar taste, which is owing to\r\nthe baking: it is very absorbent, and adheres to the tongue, which it\r\ndries. In general it is only the Javanese women who eat the ampo,\r\neither in the time of pregnancy, or in order to grow thin; the absence\r\nof plumpness being there regarded as a kind of beauty. The use of this\r\nearth is fatal to health; the women lose their appetite imperceptibly,\r\nand take only with relish a very small quantity of food; but the\r\ndesire of becoming thin, and of preserving a slender shape, induces\r\nthem to brave these dangers, and maintains the credit of the ampo.\"\r\nThe savage inhabitants of New Caledonia also, to appease their hunger\r\nin times of scarcity, eat great pieces of a friable Lapis ollaris.\r\nVauquelin analysed this stone, and found in it, beside magnesia and\r\nsilex in equal portions, a small quantity of oxide of copper. M.\r\nGoldberry had seen the negroes in Africa, in the islands of Bunck and\r\nLos Idolos, eat an earth of which he had himself eaten, without being\r\nincommoded by it, and which also was a white and friable steatite.\r\nThese examples of earth-eating in the torrid zone appear very strange.\r\nWe are struck by the anomaly of finding a taste, which might seem to\r\nbelong only to the inhabitants of the most sterile regions, prevailing\r\namong races of rude and indolent men, who live in the finest and most\r\nfertile countries on the globe. We saw at Popayan, and in several\r\nmountainous parts of Peru, lime reduced to a very fine powder, sold in\r\nthe public markets to the natives among other articles of food. This\r\npowder, when eaten, is mingled with coca, that is, with the leaves of\r\nthe Erythroxylon peruvianum. It is well known that Indian messengers\r\ntake no other aliment for whole days than lime and coca: both excite\r\nthe secretion of saliva, and of the gastric juice; they take away the\r\nappetite, without affording any nourishment to the body. In other\r\nparts of South America, on the coast of Rio de la Hacha, the Guajiros\r\nswallow lime alone, without adding any vegetable matter to it. They\r\ncarry with them a little box filled with lime, as we do snuff-boxes,\r\nand as in Asia people carry a betel-box. This American custom excited\r\nthe curiosity of the first Spanish navigators. Lime blackens the\r\nteeth; and in the Indian Archipelago, as among several American\r\nhordes, to blacken the teeth is to beautify them. In the cold regions\r\nof the kingdom of Quito, the natives of Tigua eat habitually from\r\nchoice, and without any injurious consequences, a very fine clay,\r\nmixed with quartzose sand. This clay, suspended in water, renders it\r\nmilky. We find in their huts large vessels filled with this water,\r\nwhich serves as a beverage, and which the Indians call agua or leche\r\nde llanka.* (* Water or milk of clay. Llanka is a word of the general\r\nlanguage of the Incas, signifying fine clay.)\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on these facts, we perceive that the appetite for\r\nclayey, magnesian, and calcareous earth is most common among the\r\npeople of the torrid zone; that it is not always a cause of disease;\r\nand that some tribes eat earth from choice, whilst others (as the\r\nOttomacs in America, and the inhabitants of New Caledonia in the\r\nPacific) eat it from want and to appease hunger. A great number of\r\nphysiological phenomena prove that a temporary cessation of hunger may\r\nbe produced though the substances that are submitted to the organs of\r\ndigestion may not be, properly speaking, nutritive. The earth of the\r\nOttomacs, composed of alumine and silex, furnishes probably nothing,\r\nor almost nothing, to the composition of the organs of man. These\r\norgans contain lime and magnesia in the bones, in the lymph of the\r\nthoracic duct, in the colouring matter of the blood, and in white\r\nhairs; they afford very small quantities of silex in black hair; and,\r\naccording to Vauquelin, but a few atoms of alumine in the bones,\r\nthough this is contained abundantly in the greater part of those\r\nvegetable substances which form part of our nourishment. It is not the\r\nsame with man as with animated beings placed lower in the scale of\r\norganization. In the former, assimilation is exerted only on those\r\nsubstances that enter essentially into the composition of the bones,\r\nthe muscles, and the medullary matter of the nerves and the brain.\r\nPlants, on the contrary, draw from the soil the salts that are found\r\naccidentally mixed in it; and their fibrous texture varies according\r\nto the nature of the earths that predominate in the spots which they\r\ninhabit. An object well worthy of research, and which has long fixed\r\nmy attention, is the small number of simple substances (earthy and\r\nmetallic) that enter into the composition of animated beings, and\r\nwhich alone appear fitted to maintain what we may call the chemical\r\nmovement of vitality.\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the sensations of hunger with that vague feeling\r\nof debility which is produced by want of nutrition, and by other\r\npathologic causes. The sensation of hunger ceases long before\r\ndigestion takes place, or the chyme is converted into chyle. It ceases\r\neither by a nervous and tonic impression exerted by the aliments on\r\nthe coats of the stomach; or, because the digestive apparatus is\r\nfilled with substances that excite the mucous membranes to an abundant\r\nsecretion of the gastric juice. To this tonic impression on the nerves\r\nof the stomach the prompt and salutary effects of what are called\r\nnutritive medicaments may be attributed, such as chocolate, and every\r\nsubstance that gently stimulates and nourishes at the same time. It is\r\nthe absence of a nervous stimulant that renders the solitary use of a\r\nnutritive substance (as starch, gum, or sugar) less favourable to\r\nassimilation, and to the reparation of the losses which the human body\r\nundergoes. Opium, which is not nutritive, is employed with success in\r\nAsia, in times of great scarcity; it acts as a tonic. But when the\r\nmatter which fills the stomach can be regarded neither as an aliment,\r\nthat is, as proper to be assimilated, nor as a tonic stimulating the\r\nnerves, the cessation of hunger is probably owing only to the\r\nsecretion of the gastric juice. We here touch upon a problem of\r\nphysiology which has not been sufficiently investigated. Hunger is\r\nappeased, the painful feeling of inanition ceases, when the stomach is\r\nfilled. It is said that this viscus stands in need of ballast; and\r\nevery language furnishes figurative expressions which convey the idea\r\nthat a mechanical distension of the stomach causes an agreeable\r\nsensation. Recent works of physiology still speak of the painful\r\ncontraction which the stomach experiences during hunger, the friction\r\nof its sides against one another, and the action of the gastric juice\r\non the texture of the digestive apparatus. The observations of Bichat,\r\nand more particularly the fine experiments of Majendie, are in\r\ncontradiction to these superannuated hypotheses. After twenty-four,\r\nforty-eight, or even sixty hours of abstinence, no contraction of the\r\nstomach is observed; it is only on the fourth or fifth day that this\r\norgan appears to change in a small degree its dimensions. The quantity\r\nof the gastric juice diminishes with the duration of abstinence. It is\r\nprobable that this juice, far from accumulating, is digested as an\r\nalimentary substance. If a cat or dog be made to swallow a substance\r\nwhich is not susceptible of being digested, a pebble for instance, a\r\nmucous and acid liquid is formed abundantly in the cavity of the\r\nstomach, somewhat resembling in its composition the gastric juice of\r\nthe human body. It appears to me very probable, that when the want of\r\naliments compels the Ottomacs and the inhabitants of New Caledonia to\r\nswallow clay and steatite during a part of the year, these earths\r\noccasion a powerful secretion of the gastric and pancreatic juices in\r\nthe digestive apparatus of these people. The observations which I made\r\non the banks of the Orinoco, have been recently confirmed by the\r\ndirect experiments of two distinguished young physiologists, MM.\r\nCloquet and Breschet. After long fasting they ate as much as five\r\nounces of a silvery green and very flexible laminar talc. Their hunger\r\nwas completely satisfied, and they felt no inconvenience from a kind\r\nof food to which their organs were unaccustomed. It is known that\r\ngreat use is still made in the East of the bolar and sigillated earths\r\nof Lemnos, which are clay mingled with oxide of iron. In Germany the\r\nworkmen employed in the quarries of sandstone worked at the mountain\r\nof Kiffhauser spread a very fine clay upon their bread, instead of\r\nbutter, which they call steinbutter* (stone-butter). (* This\r\nsteinbutter must not be confounded with the mountain butter\r\n(bergbutter) which is a saline substance, produced by a decomposition\r\nof aluminous schists.)\r\n\r\nThe state of perfect health enjoyed by the Ottomacs during the time\r\nwhen they use little muscular exercise, and are subjected to so\r\nextraordinary a regimen, is a phenomenon difficult to be explained. It\r\ncan be attributed only to a habit prolonged from generation to\r\ngeneration. The structure of the digestive apparatus differs much in\r\nanimals that feed exclusively on flesh or on seeds; it is even\r\nprobable that the gastric juice changes its nature, according as it is\r\nemployed in effecting the digestion of animal or vegetable substances;\r\nyet we are able gradually to change the regimen of herbivorous and\r\ncarnivorous animals, to feed the former with flesh, and the latter\r\nwith vegetables. Man can accustom himself to an extraordinary\r\nabstinence and find it but little painful if he employ tonic or\r\nstimulating substances (various drugs, small quantities of opium,\r\nbetel, tobacco, or leaves of coca); or if he supply his stomach, from\r\ntime to time, with earthy insipid substances that are not in\r\nthemselves fit for nutrition. Like man in a savage state some animals,\r\nwhen pressed by hunger in winter, swallow clay or friable steatites;\r\nsuch are the wolves in the northeast of Europe, the reindeer and,\r\naccording to the testimony of M. Patrin, the kids in Siberia. The\r\nRussian hunters, on the banks of the Yenisei and the Amour, use a\r\nclayey matter which they call rock-butter, as a bait. The animals\r\nscent this clay from afar, and are fond of the smell; as the clays of\r\nbucaro, known in Portugal and Spain by the name of odoriferous earths\r\n(tierras olorosas), have an odour agreeable to women.* (* Bucaro (vas\r\nfictile odoriferum). People are fond of drinking out of these vessels\r\non account of the smell of the clay. The women of the province of\r\nAlentejo acquire a habit of masticating the bucaro earth; and feel a\r\ngreat privation when they cannot indulge this vitiated taste.) Brown\r\nrelates in his History of Jamaica that the crocodiles of South America\r\nswallow small stones and pieces of very hard wood, when the lakes\r\nwhich they inhabit are dry, or when they are in want of food. M.\r\nBonpland and I observed in a crocodile, eleven feet long, which we\r\ndissected at Batallez, on the banks of the Rio Magdalena, that the\r\nstomach of this reptile contained half-digested fish, and rounded\r\nfragments of granite three or four inches in diameter. It is difficult\r\nto admit that the crocodiles swallow these stony masses accidentally,\r\nfor they do not catch fish with their lower jaw resting on the ground\r\nat the bottom of the river. The Indians have framed the absurd\r\nhypothesis that these indolent animals like to augment their weight,\r\nthat they may have less trouble in diving. I rather think that they\r\nload their stomach with large pebbles to excite an abundant secretion\r\nof the gastric juice. The experiments of Majendie render this\r\nexplanation extremely probable. With respect to the habit of the\r\ngranivorous birds, particularly the gallinaceae and ostriches, of\r\nswallowing sand and small pebbles, it has been hitherto attributed to\r\nan instinctive desire of accelerating the trituration of the aliments\r\nin a muscular and thick stomach.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned that tribes of Negroes on the Gambia mingle clay\r\nwith their rice. Some families of Ottomacs were perhaps formerly\r\naccustomed to cause the maize and other farinaceous seeds to rot in\r\ntheir poya, in order to eat earth and amylaceous matter together:\r\npossibly it was a preparation of this kind, that Father Gumilla\r\ndescribed indistinctly in the first volume of his work when he affirms\r\nthat the Guamos and the Ottomacs feed upon earth only because it is\r\nimpregnated with the sustancia del maiz (substance of maize) and the\r\nfat of the cayman. I have already observed that neither the present\r\nmissionary of Uruana, nor Fray Juan Gonzales, who lived long in those\r\ncountries, knew anything of this mixture of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances with the poya. Perhaps Father Gumilla has confounded the\r\npreparation of the earth which the natives swallow with the custom\r\nthey still retain (of which M. Bonpland acquired the certainty on the\r\nspot) of burying in the ground the beans of a species of mimosacea,*\r\n(* Of the genus Inga.) to cause them to enter into decomposition so as\r\nto reduce them into a white bread, savoury, but difficult of\r\ndigestion. I repeat that the balls of poya, which we took from the\r\nwinter stores of the Indians, contained no trace of animal fat, or of\r\namylaceous matter. Gumilla being one of the most credulous travellers\r\nwe know, it almost perplexes us to credit facts which even he has\r\nthought fit to reject. In the second volume of his work he however\r\ngainsays a great part of what he advanced in the first; he no longer\r\ndoubts that half at least (a lo menos) of the bread of the Ottomacs\r\nand the Guamos is clay. He asserts, that children and full grown\r\npersons not only eat this bread without suffering in their health, but\r\nalso great pieces of pure clay (muchos terrones de pura greda.) He\r\nadds that those who feel a weight on the stomach physic themselves\r\nwith the fat of the crocodile which restores their appetite and\r\nenables them to continue to eat pure earth.* (* Gumilla volume 2 page\r\n260.) It is certain that the Guamos are very fond, if not of the fat,\r\nat least of the flesh of the crocodile, which appeared to us white,\r\nand without any smell of musk. In Sennaar, according to Burckhardt, it\r\nis equally esteemed, and sold in the markets.\r\n\r\nThe little village of Uruana is more difficult to govern than most of\r\nthe other missions. The Ottomacs are a restless, turbulent people,\r\nwith unbridled passions. They are not only fond to excess of the\r\nfermented liquors prepared from cassava and maize, and of palm-wine,\r\nbut they throw themselves into a peculiar state of intoxication, we\r\nmight say of madness, by the use of the powder of niopo. They gather\r\nthe long pods of a mimosacea which we have made known by the name of\r\nAcacia niopo,* cut them into pieces, moisten them, and cause them to\r\nferment. (* It is an acacia with very delicate leaves, and not an\r\nInga. We brought home another species of mimosacea (the chiga of the\r\nOttomacs and the sepa of the Maypures) that yields seeds, the flour of\r\nwhich is eaten at Uruana like cassava. From this flour the chiga bread\r\nis prepared, which is so common at Cunariche, and on the banks of the\r\nLower Orinoco. The chiga is a species of Inga, and I know of no other\r\nmimosacea that can supply the place of the cerealia.) When the\r\nsoftened seeds begin to grow black, they are kneaded like a paste;\r\nmixed with some flour of cassava and lime procured from the shell of a\r\nhelix, and the whole mass is exposed to a very brisk fire, on a\r\ngridiron made of hard wood. The hardened paste takes the form of small\r\ncakes. When it is to be used, it is reduced to a fine powder, and\r\nplaced on a dish five or six inches wide. The Ottomac holds this dish,\r\nwhich has a handle, in his right hand, while he inhales the niopo by\r\nthe nose, through the forked bone of a bird, the two extremities of\r\nwhich are applied to the nostrils. This bone, without which the\r\nOttomac believes that he could not take this kind of snuff, is seven\r\ninches long: it appeared to me to be the leg-bone of a large sort of\r\nplover. The niopo is so stimulating that the smallest portions of it\r\nproduce violent sneezing in those who are not accustomed to its use.\r\nFather Gumilla says this diabolical powder of the Ottomacs, furnished\r\nby an arborescent tobacco-plant, intoxicates them through the nostrils\r\n(emboracha por las narices), deprives them of reason for some hours,\r\nand renders them furious in battle. However varied may be the family\r\nof the leguminous plants in the chemical and medical properties of\r\ntheir seeds, juices, and roots, we cannot believe, from what we know\r\nhitherto of the group of mimosaceae, that it is principally the pod of\r\nthe Acacia niopo which imparts the stimulant power to the snuff of the\r\nOttomacs. This power is owing, no doubt, to the freshly calcined lime.\r\nWe have shown above that the mountaineers of the Andes of Popayan, and\r\nthe Guajiros, who wander between the lake of Maracaybo and the Rio la\r\nHacha, are also fond of swallowing lime as a stimulant, to augment the\r\nsecretion of the saliva and the gastric juice.\r\n\r\nA custom analogous to the use of the niopo just described was observed\r\nby La Condamine among the natives of the Upper Maranon. The Omaguas,\r\nwhose name is rendered celebrated by the expeditions attempted in\r\nsearch of El Dorado, have like the Ottomacs a dish, and the hollow\r\nbone of a bird, by which they convey to their nostrils their powder of\r\ncurupa. The seed that yields this powder is no doubt also a mimosacea;\r\nfor the Ottomacs, according to Father Gili, designate even now, at the\r\ndistance of one hundred and sixty leagues from the Amazon, the Acacia\r\nniopo by the name of curupa. Since the geographical researches which I\r\nhave recently made on the scene of the exploits of Philip von Huten,\r\nand the real situation of the province of Papamene, or of the Omaguas,\r\nthe probability of an ancient communication between the Ottomacs of\r\nthe Orinoco and the Omaguas of the Maranon has become more interesting\r\nand more probable. The former came from the Meta, perhaps from the\r\ncountry between the Meta and the Guaviare; the latter assert that they\r\ndescended in great numbers to the Maranon by the Rio Jupura, coming\r\nfrom the eastern declivity of the Andes of New Grenada. Now, it is\r\nprecisely between the Guayavero (which joins the Guaviare) and the\r\nCaqueta (which takes lower down the name of Japura) that the country\r\nof the Omagua appears to be situate, of which the adventurers of Coro\r\nand Tocuyo in vain attempted the conquest. There is no doubt a\r\nstriking contrast between the present barbarism of the Ottomacs and\r\nthe ancient civilization of the Omaguas; but all parts of the latter\r\nnation were not perhaps alike advanced in civilization, and the\r\nexample of tribes fallen into complete barbarism are unhappily but too\r\ncommon in the history of our species. Another point of resemblance may\r\nbe remarked between the Ottomacs and the Omaguas. Both of these\r\nnations are celebrated among all the tribes of the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazon for their employment of caoutchouc in the manufacture of\r\nvarious articles of utility.\r\n\r\nThe real herbaceous tobacco* (for the missionaries have the habit of\r\ncalling the niopo or curupa tree-tobacco) has been cultivated from\r\ntime immemorial by all the native people of the Orinoco; and at the\r\nperiod of the conquest the habit of smoking was found to be alike\r\nspread over both North and South America.\r\n\r\n(* The word tobacco (tabacco), like the words savannah, maize,\r\ncacique, maguey (agave), and manati, belongs to the ancient language\r\nof Haiti, or St. Domingo. It did not properly denote the herb but the\r\ntube through which the smoke was inhaled. It seems surprising that a\r\nvegetable production so universally spread should have different names\r\namong neighbouring people. The pete-ma of the Omaguas is, no doubt,\r\nthe pety of the Guaranos; but the analogy between the Cabre and\r\nAlgonkin (or Lenni-Lenape) words which denote tobacco may be merely\r\naccidental. The following are the synonyms in thirteen languages.\r\n\r\nNorth America. Aztec or Mexican; yetl: Algonkin; sema: Huron; oyngoua.\r\n\r\nSouth America. Peruvian or Quichua; sayri: Chiquito; pais. Guarany;\r\npety: Vilela; tusup: Mbaja (west of the Paraguay), nalodagadi: Moxo\r\n(between the Rio Ucayale and the Rio Madeira); sabare. Omagua; petema.\r\nTamanac; cavas. Maypure; jema. Cabre; scema.)\r\n\r\nThe Tamanacs and the Maypures of Guiana wrap maize-leaves round their\r\ncigars, as the Mexicans did at the time of the arrival of Cortes. The\r\nSpaniards have substituted paper for the leaves of maize in imitation\r\nof them. The poor Indians of the forests of the Orinoco know as well\r\nas did the great nobles at the court of Montezuma that the smoke of\r\ntobacco is an excellent narcotic; and they use it not only to procure\r\ntheir afternoon nap, but also to put themselves into that state of\r\nquiescence, which they call dreaming with the eyes open, or\r\nday-dreaming. The use of tobacco appears to me to be now very rare in\r\nthe missions; and in New Spain, to the great regret of the\r\nrevenue-officers, the natives, who are almost all descended from the\r\nlowest class of the Aztec people, do not smoke at all. Father Gili\r\naffirms that the practice of chewing tobacco is unknown to the Indians\r\nof the Lower Orinoco. I rather doubt the truth of this assertion,\r\nhaving been told that the Sercucumas of the Erevato and the Caura,\r\nneighbours of the whitish Taparitos, swallow tobacco chopped small,\r\nand impregnated with some other very stimulant juices, to prepare\r\nthemselves for battle. Of the four species of nicotiana cultivated in\r\nEurope* (* Nicotiana tabacum, N. rustica, N. paniculata, and N.\r\nglutinosa.) we found only two growing wild; but the Nicotiana\r\nloxensis, and the Nicotiana andicola, which I found on the back of the\r\nAndes, at the height of eighteen hundred and fifty toises (almost the\r\nheight of the Peak of Teneriffe), are very similar to the N. tabacum\r\nand N. rustica. The whole genus, however, is almost exclusively\r\nAmerican, and the greater number of the species appeared to me to\r\nbelong to the mountainous and temperate region of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIt was neither from Virginia, nor from South America, but from the\r\nMexican province of Yucatan, that Europe received the first tobacco\r\nseeds, about the year 1559.* (* The Spaniards became acquainted with\r\ntobacco in the West India Islands at the end of the 15th century. I\r\nhave already mentioned that the cultivation of this narcotic plant\r\npreceded the cultivation of the potato in Europe more than 120 or 140\r\nyears. When Raleigh brought tobacco from Virginia to England in 1586,\r\nwhole fields of it were already cultivated in Portugal. It was also\r\npreviously known in France, where it was brought into fashion by\r\nCatherine de Medicis, from whom it received the name of herbe a la\r\nreine, the queen's herb.) The celebrated Raleigh contributed most to\r\nintroduce the custom of smoking among the nations of the north. As\r\nearly as the end of the sixteenth century bitter complaints were made\r\nin England of this imitation of the manners of a savage people. It was\r\nfeared that, by the practice of smoking tobacco, Englishmen would\r\ndegenerate into a barbarous state.* (* This remarkable passage of\r\nCamden is as follows, Annal. Elizabet. page 143 1585; \"ex illo sane\r\ntempore [tabacum] usu cepit esse creberrimo in Anglia et magno pretio\r\ndum quamplurimi graveolentem illius fumum per tubulum testaceum\r\nhauriunt et mox e naribus efflant; adeo ut Auglornm corporum in\r\nbarbarorum naturam degenerasse videantur, quum iidem ac barbari\r\ndelectentur.\" We may see from this passage that they emitted the smoke\r\nthrough the nose; but at the court of Montezuma the pipe was held in\r\none hand, while the nostrils were stopped with the other, in order\r\nthat the smoke might be more easily swallowed. Life of Raleigh volume\r\n1 page 82.)\r\n\r\nWhen the Ottomacs of Uruana, by the use of niopo (their arborescent\r\ntobacco), and of fermented liquors, have thrown themselves into a\r\nstate of intoxication, which lasts several days, they kill one another\r\nwithout ostensibly fighting. The most vindictive among them poison the\r\nnail of their thumb with curare; and, according to the testimony of\r\nthe missionary, the mere impression of this poisoned nail may become a\r\nmortal wound if the curare be very active and immediately mingle with\r\nthe mass of the blood. When the Indians, after a quarrel at night,\r\ncommit a murder, they throw the dead body into the river, fearing that\r\nsome indications of the violence committed on the deceased may be\r\nobserved. \"Every time,\" said Father Bueno, \"that I see the women fetch\r\nwater from a part of the shore to which they are not accustomed to go,\r\nI suspect that a murder has been committed in my mission.\"\r\n\r\nWe found in the Indian huts at Uruana the vegetable substance called\r\ntouchwood of ants,* (* Yesca de hormigas.) with which we had become\r\nacquainted at the Great Cataracts, and which is employed to stop\r\nbleeding. This substance, which might less improperly be called ants'\r\nnests, is in much request in a region whose inhabitants are of so\r\nturbulent a character. A new species of ant, of a fine emerald-green\r\n(Formica spinicollis), collects for its habitation a cotton-down, of a\r\nyellowish-brown colour, and very soft to the touch, from the leaves of\r\na melastomacea. I have no doubt that the yesca or touchwood of ants of\r\nthe Upper Orinoco (the animal is found, we were assured, only south of\r\nAtures) will one day become an article of trade. This substance is\r\nvery superior to the ants' nests of Cayenne, which are employed in the\r\nhospitals of Europe, but can rarely be procured.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June we took leave with regret of Father Ramon Bueno. Of\r\nthe ten missionaries whom we had found in different parts of the vast\r\nextent of Guiana, he alone appeared to me to be earnestly attentive to\r\nall that regarded the natives. He hoped to return in a short time to\r\nMadrid, where he intended to publish the result of his researches on\r\nthe figures and characters that cover the rocks of Uruana.\r\n\r\nIn the countries we had just passed through, between the Meta, the\r\nArauca, and the Apure, there were found, at the time of the first\r\nexpeditions to the Orinoco, in 1535, those mute dogs, called by the\r\nnatives maios, and auries. This fact is curious in many points of\r\nview. We cannot doubt that the dog, whatever Father Gili may assert,\r\nis indigenous in South America. The different Indian languages furnish\r\nwords to designate this animal, which are scarcely derived from any\r\nEuropean tongue. To this day the word auri, mentioned three hundred\r\nyears ago by Alonzo de Herrera, is found in the Maypure. The dogs we\r\nsaw at the Orinoco may perhaps have descended from those that the\r\nSpaniards carried to the coast of Caracas; but it is not less certain\r\nthat there existed a race of dogs before the conquest, in Peru, in New\r\nGranada, and in Guiana, resembling our shepherds' dogs. The allco of\r\nthe natives of Peru, and in general all the dogs that we found in the\r\nwildest countries of South America, bark frequently. The first\r\nhistorians, however, all speak of mute dogs (perros mudos). They still\r\nexist in Canada; and, what appears to me worthy of attention, it was\r\nthis dumb variety that was eaten in preference in Mexico,* and at the\r\nOrinoco. (* See on the Mexican techichi and on the numerous\r\ndifficulties that occur in the history of mute dogs and dogs destitute\r\nof hair the Views of Nature Bohn's edition page 85.) A very well\r\ninformed traveller, M. Giesecke, who resided six years in Greenland,\r\nassured me that the dogs of the Esquimaux, which pass their lives in\r\nthe open air and bury themselves in winter beneath the snow, do not\r\nbark, but howl like wolves.* (* They sit down in a circle, one of them\r\nbegins to howl alone and the others follow in the same tone. The\r\ngroups of alouate monkeys howl in the same manner, and among them the\r\nIndians distinguish the leader of the band. It was the practice at\r\nMexico to castrate the mute dogs in order to fatten them. This\r\noperation must have contributed to alter the organ of the voice.)\r\n\r\nThe practice of eating the flesh of dogs is now entirely unknown on\r\nthe banks of the Orinoco; but as it is a Tartar custom spread through\r\nall the eastern part of Asia, it appears to me highly interesting for\r\nthe history of nations to have ascertained that it existed heretofore\r\nin the hot regions of Guiana and on the table-lands of Mexico. I must\r\nobserve, also, that on the confines of the province of Durango, at the\r\nnorthern extremity of New Spain, the Comanches have preserved the\r\nhabit of loading the backs of the great dogs that accompany them in\r\ntheir migrations with their tents of buffalo-leather. It is well known\r\nthat employing dogs as beasts of burthen and of draught is equally\r\ncommon near the Slave Lake and in Siberia. I dwell on these features\r\nof conformity in the manners of nations, which become of some weight\r\nwhen they are not solitary, and are connected with the analogies\r\nfurnished by the structure of languages, the division of time, and\r\nreligious creeds and institutions.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night at the island of Cucuruparu, called also Playa de\r\nla Tortuga, because the Indians of Uruana go thither to collect the\r\nturtles' eggs. It is one of the best determined points of latitude\r\nalong the banks of the Orinoco. I was there fortunate enough to\r\nobserve the passage of three stars over the meridian. To the east of\r\nthe island is the mouth of the Cano de la Tortuga, which descends from\r\nthe mountains of Cerbatana, continually wrapped in electric clouds. On\r\nthe southern bank of the Cano, between the tributary streams Parapara\r\nand Oche, lies the almost ruined mission of San Miguel de la Tortuga.\r\nThe Indians assured us that the environs of this little mission abound\r\nin otters with a very fine fur, called by the Portuguese water-dogs\r\n(perritos de agua); and what is still more remarkable, in lizards\r\n(lagartos) with only two feet. The whole of this country, which is\r\nvery accessible between the Rio Cuchivero and the strait of Baraguan,\r\nis worthy of being visited by a well-informed zoologist. The lagarto\r\ndestitute of hinder extremities is perhaps a species of Siren,\r\ndifferent from the Siren lacertina of Carolina. If it were a saurian,\r\na real Bimanis (Chirotes, Cuvier), the natives would not have compared\r\nit to a lizard. Besides the arrau turtles, of which I have in a former\r\nplace given a detailed account, an innumerable quantity of land\r\ntortoises also, called morocoi, are found on the banks of the Orinoco,\r\nbetween Uruana and Encaramada. During the great heats of summer, in\r\nthe time of drought, these animals remain without taking food, hidden\r\nbeneath stones, or in the holes they have dug. They issue from their\r\nshelter and begin to eat, only when the humidity of the first rains\r\npenetrates into the earth. The terekay, or tajelu turtle which lives\r\nin fresh water, has the same habits. I have already spoken of the\r\nsummer-sleep of some animals of the tropics. As the natives know the\r\nholes in which the tortoises sleep amidst the dried lands, they get\r\nout a great number at once, by digging fifteen or eighteen inches\r\ndeep. Father Gili says that this operation, which he had seen, is not\r\nwithout danger, because serpents often bury themselves in summer with\r\nthe terekays.\r\n\r\nFrom the island of Cucuruparu, to the capital of Guiana, commonly\r\ncalled Angostura, we were but nine days on the water. The distance is\r\nsomewhat less than ninety-five leagues. We seldom slept on shore but\r\nthe torment of the mosquitos diminished in proportion as we advanced.\r\nWe landed on the 8th of June at a farm (Hato de San Rafael del\r\nCapuchino) opposite the mouth of the Rio Apure. I obtained some good\r\nobservations of latitude and longitude.* (* I had found, on the 4th of\r\nApril, for the Boca del Rio Apure (on the western bank of the\r\nOrinoco), the latitude 7 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds, the longitude\r\n59 degrees 7 minutes 30 seconds; on the 8th of June I found, for the\r\nHato del Capuchino (on the eastern bank of the Orinoco), the latitude\r\n7 degrees 37 minutes 45 seconds, the longitude 69 degrees 5 minutes 30\r\nseconds.) Having two months before taken horary angles on the bank\r\nopposite Capuchino, these observations were important for determining\r\nthe rate of my chronometer, and connecting the situations on the\r\nOrinoco with those on the shore of Venezuela. The situation of this\r\nfarm, being at the point where the Orinoco changes its course (which\r\nhad previously been from south to north), and runs from west to east,\r\nis extremely picturesque. Granite rocks rise like islets amidst vast\r\nmeadows. From their tops we discerned towards the north the Llanos of\r\nCalabozo bounding the horizon. We had been so long accustomed to the\r\naspect of forests, that this view made a powerful impression on us.\r\nThe steppes after sunset assume a tint of greenish gray. The visual\r\nray being intercepted only by the rotundity of the earth, the stars\r\nseemed to rise as from the bosom of the ocean, and the most\r\nexperienced mariner would have fancied himself placed on a projecting\r\ncape of a rocky coast. Our host was a Frenchman who lived amidst his\r\nnumerous herds. Though he had forgotten his native language, he seemed\r\npleased to learn that we came from his country, which he had left\r\nforty years before; and he wished to retain us for some days at his\r\nfarm. The small towns of Caycara and Cabruta were only a few miles\r\ndistant from the farm; but during part of the year our host was in\r\ncomplete solitude. The Capuchino becomes an island by the inundations\r\nof the Apure and the Orinoco, and the communication with the\r\nneighbouring farms can be kept up only by means of a boat. The horned\r\ncattle then seek the higher grounds which extend on the south toward\r\nthe chain of the mountains of Encaramada. This granitic chain is\r\nintersected by valleys which contain magnetic sands (granulary\r\noxidulated iron), owing no doubt to the decomposition of some\r\namphibolic or chloritic strata.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th of June we met a great number of boats laden\r\nwith merchandize sailing up the Orinoco, in order to enter the Apure.\r\nThis is a commercial road much frequented between Angostura and the\r\nport of Torunos in the province of Varinas. Our fellow-traveller, Don\r\nNicolas Soto, brother-in-law of the governor of Varinas, took the same\r\ncourse to return to his family. At the period of the high waters,\r\nseveral months are lost in contending with the currents of the\r\nOrinoco, the Apure, and the Rio de Santo Domingo. The boatmen are\r\nforced to carry out ropes to the trunks of trees and thus warp their\r\ncanoes up. In the great sinuosities of the river whole days are\r\nsometimes passed without advancing more than two or three hundred\r\ntoises. Since my return to Europe the communications between the mouth\r\nof the Orinoco and the provinces situated on the eastern slope of the\r\nmountains of Merida, Pamplona, and Santa Fe de Bogota, have become\r\nmore active; and it may be hoped that steamboats will facilitate these\r\nlong voyages on the Lower Orinoco, the Portuguesa, the Rio Santo\r\nDomingo, the Orivante, the Meta, and the Guaviare. Magazines of cleft\r\nwood might be formed, as on the banks of the great rivers of the\r\nUnited States, sheltering them under sheds. This precaution would be\r\nindispensable, as, in the country through which we passed, it is not\r\neasy to procure dry fuel fit to keep up a fire beneath the boiler of a\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nWe disembarked below San Rafael del Capuchino, on the right, at the\r\nVilla de Caycara, near a cove called Puerto Sedeno. The Villa is\r\nmerely a few houses grouped together. Alta Gracia, la Ciudad de la\r\nPiedra, Real Corona, Borbon, in short all the towns or villas lying\r\nbetween the mouth of the Apure and Angostura, are equally miserable.\r\nThe presidents of the missions, and the governors of the provinces,\r\nwere formerly accustomed to demand the privileges of villas and\r\nciudades at Madrid, the moment the first foundations of a church were\r\nlaid. This was a means of persuading the ministry that the colonies\r\nwere augmenting rapidly in population and prosperity. Sculptured\r\nfigures of the sun and moon, such as I have already mentioned, are\r\nfound near Caycara, at the Cerro del Tirano.* (* The tyrant after whom\r\nthese mountains are named is not Lope de Aguirre, but probably, as the\r\nname of the neighbouring cove seems to prove, the celebrated\r\nconquistador Antonio Sedeno, who, after the expedition of Herrera,\r\nsought to penetrate by the Orinoco to the Rio Meta. He was in a state\r\nof rebellion against the audiencia of Santo Domingo. I know not how\r\nSedeno came to Caycara; for historians relate that he was poisoned on\r\nthe banks of the Rio Tisnado, one of the tributary streams of the\r\nPortuguesa.) It is the work of the old people (that is of our\r\nfathers), say the natives. On a rock more distant from the shore, and\r\ncalled Tecoma, the symbolic figures are found, it is said, at the\r\nheight of a hundred feet. The Indians knew heretofore a road, that led\r\nby land from Caycara to Demerara and Essequibo.\r\n\r\nOn the northern bank of the Orinoco, opposite Caycara, is the mission\r\nof Cabruta, founded by the Jesuit Rotella, in 1740, as an advanced\r\npost against the Caribs. An Indian village, known by the name of\r\nCabritu,* had existed on the same spot for several ages. (* A cacique\r\nof Cabritu received Alonzo de Herrera at his dwelling, on the\r\nexpedition undertaken by Herrera for ascending the Orinoco in 1535.)\r\nAt the time when this little place became a Christian settlement, it\r\nwas believed to be situate in 5 degrees latitude, or two degrees forty\r\nminutes more to the south than I found it by direct observations made\r\nat San Rafael, and at La Boca del Rio Apure. No idea was then\r\nconceived of the direction of a road that could lead by land to Nueva\r\nValencia and Caracas, which were supposed to be at an immense\r\ndistance. The merit of having first crossed the Llanos to go to\r\nCabruta from the Villa de San Juan Baptista del Pao belongs to a\r\nwoman. Father Gili relates that Dona Maria Bargas was so devoted to\r\nthe Jesuits that she attempted herself to discover the way to the\r\nmissions. She was seen with astonishment to arrive at Cabruta from the\r\nnorth. She took up her abode near the fathers of St. Ignatius, and\r\ndied in their settlements on the banks of the Orinoco. Since that\r\nperiod the northern part of the Llanos has been considerably peopled;\r\nand the road leading from the valleys of Aragua by Calabozo to San\r\nFernando de Apure and Cabruta is much frequented. The chief of the\r\nfamous expedition of the boundaries made choice of the latter place in\r\n1754 to establish dock-yards for building the vessels necessary for\r\nconveying his troops intended for the Upper Orinoco. The little\r\nmountain that rises northeast of Cabruta can be discerned from afar in\r\nthe steppes and serves as a landmark for travellers.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in the morning at Caycara; and driving with the current of\r\nthe Orinoco, we soon passed the mouth of the Rio Cuchivero, which\r\naccording to ancient tradition is the country of the Aikeambenanos, or\r\nwomen without husbands; and we there reached the paltry village of\r\nAlta Gracia, which is called a Spanish town. It was near this place\r\nthat Jose de Iturriaga founded the Pueblo de Ciudad Real, which still\r\nfigures on the most modern maps, though it has not existed for fifty\r\nyears past, on account of the insalubrity of its situation. Beyond the\r\npoint where the Orinoco turns to the east, forests are constantly seen\r\non the right bank, and the llanos or steppes of Venezuela on the left.\r\nThe forests which border the river are not however so thick as those\r\nof the Upper Orinoco. The population, which augments perceptibly as\r\nyou advance toward the capital, comprises but few Indians, and is\r\ncomposed chiefly of whites, negroes, and men of mixed descent. The\r\nnumber of the negroes is not great; but here, as everywhere else, the\r\npoverty of their masters does not tend to procure for them more humane\r\ntreatment. An inhabitant of Caycara had just been condemned to four\r\nyears' imprisonment, and a fine of one hundred piastres for having, in\r\na paroxysm of rage, tied a negress by the legs to the tail of his\r\nhorse, and dragged her at full gallop through the savannah till she\r\nexpired. It is gratifying to record that the Audiencia was generally\r\nblamed in the country for not having punished more severely so\r\natrocious an action. Yet some few persons, who pretended to be the\r\nmost enlightened and most sagacious of the community, deemed the\r\npunishment of a white contrary to sound policy, at the moment when the\r\nblacks of St. Domingo were in complete insurrection. Since I left\r\nthose countries, civil dissensions have put arms into the hands of the\r\nslaves; and fatal experience has led the inhabitants of Venezuela to\r\nregret that they refused to listen to Don Domingo Tovar, and other\r\nright-thinking men, who, as early as the year 1795, lifted up their\r\nvoices in the cabildo of Caracas, to prevent the introduction of\r\nblacks, and to propose means that might ameliorate their condition.\r\n\r\nAfter having slept on the 10th of June in an island in the middle of\r\nthe river (I believe that called Acaru by Father Caulin), we passed\r\nthe mouth of the Rio Caura. This, the Aruy and the Carony, are the\r\nlargest tributary streams which the Orinoco receives on its right\r\nbank. All the Christian settlements are near the mouth of the river;\r\nand the villages of San Pedro, Aripao, Urbani, and Guaraguaraico,\r\nsucceed each other at the distance of a few leagues. The first and the\r\nmost populous contains only about two hundred and fifty souls. San\r\nLuis de Guaraguaraico is a colony of negroes, some freed and others\r\nfugitives from Essequibo. This colony merits the particular attention\r\nof the Spanish Government, for it can never be sufficiently\r\nrecommended to endeavour to attach the slaves to the soil, and suffer\r\nthem to enjoy as farmers the fruits of their agricultural labours. The\r\nland on the Caura, for the most part a virgin soil, is extremely\r\nfertile. There are pasturages for more than 15,000 beasts; but the\r\npoor inhabitants have neither horses nor horned cattle. More than\r\nfive-sixths of the banks of the Caura are either desert, or occupied\r\nby independent and savage tribes. The bed of the river is twice choked\r\nup by rocks: these obstructions occasion the famous Raudales of Mura\r\nand of Para or Paru, the latter of which has a portage, because it\r\ncannot be passed by canoes. At the time of the expedition of the\r\nboundaries, a small fort was erected on the northern cataract, that of\r\nMura; and the governor, Don Manuel Centurion, gave the name of Ciudad\r\nde San Carlos to a few houses which some families, consisting of\r\nwhites and mulattos, had constructed near the fort. South of the\r\ncataract of Para, at the confluence of the Caura and the Erevato, the\r\nmission of San Luis was then situated; and a road by land led thence\r\nto Angostura, the capital of the province. All these attempts at\r\ncivilization have been fruitless. No village now exists above the\r\nRaudal of Mura; and here, as in many other parts of the colonies, the\r\nnatives may be said to have reconquered the country from the\r\nSpaniards. The valley of Caura may become one day or other highly\r\ninteresting from the value of its productions, and the communications\r\nwhich it affords with the Rio Ventuari, the Carony, and the Cuyuni. I\r\nhave shown above the importance of the four tributary streams which\r\nthe Orinoco receives from the mountains of Parima. Near the mouth of\r\nthe Caura, between the villages of San Pedro de Alcantara and San\r\nFrancisco de Aripao, a small lake of four hundred toises in diameter\r\nwas formed in 1790, by the sinking of the ground, consequent on an\r\nearthquake. It was a portion of the forest of Aripao, which sunk to\r\nthe depth of eighty or a hundred feet below the level of the\r\nneighbouring land. The trees remained green for several months; and\r\nsome of them, it was believed, continued to push forth leaves beneath\r\nthe water. This phenomenon is the more worthy of attention as the soil\r\nof these countries is probably granitic. I doubt the secondary\r\nformations of the Llanos being continued southward as far as the\r\nvalley of Caura.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June we landed on the right bank of the Orinoco at\r\nPuerto de los Frailes, at the distance of three leagues above the\r\nCiudad de la Piedra, to take altitudes of the sun. The longitude of\r\nthis point is 67 degrees 26 minutes 20 seconds, or 1 degree 41 minutes\r\neast of the mouth of the Apure. Farther on, between the towns of La\r\nPiedra and Muitaco, or Real Corona, are the Torno and Boca del\r\nInfierno, two points formerly dreaded by travellers. The Orinoco\r\nsuddenly changes its direction; it flows first east, then\r\nnorth-north-west, and then again east. A little above the Cano\r\nMarapiche, which opens on the northern bank, a very long island\r\ndivides the river into two branches. We passed on the south of this\r\nisland without difficulty; northward, a chain of small rocks, half\r\ncovered at high water, forms whirlpools and rapids. This is La Boca\r\ndel Infierno, and the Raudal de Camiseta. The first expeditions of\r\nDiego Ordaz (1531) and Alonzo de Herrera (1535) have given celebrity\r\nto this bar. The Great Cataracts of the Atures and Maypures were then\r\nunknown; and the clumsy vessels (vergantines), in which travellers\r\npersisted in going up the river, rendered the passage through the\r\nrapids extremely difficult. At present no apprehension is felt in\r\nascending or descending the Orinoco, at any season, from its mouth as\r\nfar as the confluence of the Apure and the Meta. The only falls of\r\nwater in this space are those of Torno or Camiseta, Marimara, and\r\nCariven or Carichana Vieja. Neither of these three obstacles is to be\r\nfeared with experienced Indian pilots. I dwell on these hydrographic\r\ndetails because a great political and commercial interest is now\r\nconnected with the communications between Angostura and the banks of\r\nthe Meta and the Apure, two rivers that lead to the eastern side of\r\nthe Cordilleras of New Grenada. The navigation from the mouth of the\r\nLower Orinoco to the province of Varinas is difficult only on account\r\nof the current. The bed of the river nowhere presents obstacles more\r\ndifficult to be surmounted than those of the Danube between Vienna and\r\nLinz. We meet with no great bars, no real cataracts, until we get\r\nabove the Meta. The Upper Orinoco, therefore, with the Cassiquiare and\r\nthe Rio Negro, forms a particular system of rivers, where the active\r\nindustry of Angostura and the shore of Caracas will remain long\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nI obtained horary angles of the sun in an island in the midst of the\r\nBoca del Infierno, where we had set up our instruments. The longitude\r\nof this point according to the chronometer is 67 degrees 10 minutes 31\r\nseconds. I attempted to determine the magnetic dip and intensity, but\r\nwas prevented by a heavy storm of rain. As the sky again became serene\r\nin the afternoon, we lay down to rest that night on a vast beach, on\r\nthe southern bank of the Orinoco, nearly in the meridian of the little\r\ntown of Muitaco, or Real Corona. I found the latitude by three stars\r\nto be 8 degrees 0 minutes 26 seconds, and the longitude 67 degrees 5\r\nminutes 19 seconds. When the Observantin monks in 1752 made their\r\nfirst entradas on the territory of the Caribs, they constructed on\r\nthis spot a small fort. The proximity of the lofty mountains of\r\nAraguacais renders Muitaco one of the most healthy places on the Lower\r\nOrinoco. There Iturriaga took up his abode in 1756, to repose after\r\nthe fatigues of the expedition of the boundaries; and as he attributed\r\nhis recovery to this hot rather than humid climate, the town, or more\r\nproperly the village, of Real Corona took the name of Pueblo del\r\nPuerto sano. Going down the Orinoco more to the east, we left the\r\nmouth of the Rio Pao on the north, and that of the Arui on the south.\r\nThe latter river, which is somewhat considerable, is often mentioned\r\nby Raleigh. The current of the Orinoco diminished in velocity as we\r\nadvanced. I measured several times a base along the beach, to\r\nascertain the time taken by floating bodies in traversing a known\r\ndistance. Above Alta Gracia, near the mouth of the Rio Ujape, I had\r\nfound the velocity of the Orinoco 2.3 feet in a second; between\r\nMuitaco and Borbon it was only 1.7 foot. The barometric observations\r\nmade in the neighbouring steppes prove the small slope of the ground\r\nfrom the longitude of 69 degrees to the eastern coast of Guiana. We\r\nfound in this country, on the right bank of the Orinoco, small\r\nformations of primitive grunstein, superimposed on granite (perhaps\r\neven embedded in the rock). We saw between Muitaco and the island of\r\nCeiba a hill entirely composed of balls with concentric layers, in\r\nwhich we perceived a close mixture of hornblende and feldspar, with\r\nsome traces of pyrites. The grunstein resembles that in the vicinity\r\nof Caracas; but it was impossible to ascertain the position of a\r\nformation which appeared to me to be of the same age as the granite of\r\nParima. Muitaco was the last spot where we slept in the open air on\r\nthe shore of the Orinoco: we proceeded along the river two nights more\r\nbefore we reached Angostura, which terminated our voyage.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for me to express the satisfaction we felt on\r\nlanding at Angostura, the capital of Spanish Guiana. The\r\ninconveniences endured at sea in small vessels are trivial in\r\ncomparison with those that are suffered under a burning sky,\r\nsurrounded by swarms of mosquitos, and lying stretched in a canoe,\r\nwithout the possibility of taking the least bodily exercise. In\r\nseventy-five days we had performed a passage of five hundred leagues\r\n(twenty to a degree) on the five great rivers, Apure, Orinoco,\r\nAtabapo, Rio Negro, and Cassiquiare; and in this vast extent we had\r\nfound but a very small number of inhabited places. After the life we\r\nhad led in the woods, our dress was not in the very best order, yet\r\nnevertheless M. Bonpland and I hastened to present ourselves to Don\r\nFelipe de Ynciarte, the governor of the province of Guiana. He\r\nreceived us in the most cordial manner, and lodged us in the house of\r\nthe secretary of the Intendencia. Coming from an almost desert\r\ncountry, we were struck with the bustle of the town, though it\r\ncontained only six thousand inhabitants. We admired the conveniences\r\nwhich industry and commerce furnish to civilized man. Humble dwellings\r\nappeared to us magnificent; and every person with whom we conversed\r\nseemed to be endowed with superior intelligence. Long privations give\r\na value to the smallest enjoyments; and I cannot express the pleasure\r\nwe felt when we saw for the first time wheaten bread on the governor's\r\ntable. Sensations of this sort are doubtless familiar to all who have\r\nmade distant voyages.\r\n\r\nA painful circumstance obliged us to sojourn a whole month in the town\r\nof Angostura. We felt ourselves on the first days after our arrival\r\ntired and enfeebled, but in perfect health. M. Bonpland began to\r\nexamine the small number of plants which he had been able to save from\r\nthe influence of the damp climate; and I was occupied in settling by\r\nastronomical observations the longitude and latitude of the capital,*\r\nas well as the dip of the magnetic needle. (* I found the latitude of\r\nSanto Tomas de la Nueva Guiana, commonly called Angostura, or the\r\nStrait, near the cathedral, 8 degrees 8 minutes 11 seconds, the\r\nlongitude 66 degrees 15 minutes 21 seconds.) These labours were soon\r\ninterrupted. We were both attacked almost on the same day by a\r\ndisorder which with my fellow-traveller took the character of a\r\ndebilitating fever. At this period the air was in a state of the\r\ngreatest salubrity at Angostura; and as the only mulatto servant we\r\nhad brought from Cumana felt symptoms of the same disorder, it was\r\nsuspected that we had imbibed the germs of typhus in the damp forests\r\nof Cassiquiare. It is common enough for travellers to feel no effects\r\nfrom miasmata till, on arriving in a purer atmosphere, they begin to\r\nenjoy repose. A certain excitement of the mental powers may suspend\r\nfor some time the action of pathogenic causes. Our mulatto servant\r\nhaving been much more exposed to the rains than we were, his disorder\r\nincreased with frightful rapidity. His prostration of strength was\r\nexcessive, and on the ninth day his death was announced to us. He was\r\nhowever only in a state of swooning, which lasted several hours, and\r\nwas followed by a salutary crisis. I was attacked at the same time\r\nwith a violent fit of fever, during which I was made to take a mixture\r\nof honey and bark (the cortex Angosturae): a remedy much extolled in\r\nthe country by the Capuchin missionaries. The intensity of the fever\r\naugmented but it left me on the following day. M. Bonpland remained in\r\na very alarming state which during several weeks caused us the most\r\nserious inquietude. Fortunately he preserved sufficient\r\nself-possession to prescribe for himself; and he preferred gentler\r\nremedies better adapted to his constitution. The fever was continual\r\nand, as almost always happens within the tropics, it was accompanied\r\nby dysentery. M. Bonpland displayed that courage and mildness of\r\ncharacter which never forsook him in the most trying situations. I was\r\nagitated by sad presages for I remembered that the botanist Loefling,\r\na pupil of Linnaeus, died not far from Angostura, near the banks of\r\nthe Carony, a victim of his zeal for the progress of natural history.\r\nWe had not yet passed a year in the torrid zone and my too faithful\r\nmemory conjured up everything I had read in Europe on the dangers of\r\nthe atmosphere inhaled in the forests. Instead of going up the Orinoco\r\nwe might have sojourned some months in the temperate and salubrious\r\nclimate of the Sierra Nevada de Merida. It was I who had chosen the\r\npath of the rivers; and the danger of my fellow-traveller presented\r\nitself to my mind as the fatal consequence of this imprudent choice.\r\n\r\nAfter having attained in a few days an extraordinary degree of\r\nexacerbation the fever assumed a less alarming character. The\r\ninflammation of the intestines yielded to the use of emollients\r\nobtained from malvaceous plants. The sidas and the melochias have\r\nsingularly active properties in the torrid zone. The recovery of the\r\npatient however was extremely slow, as it always happens with\r\nEuropeans who are not thoroughly seasoned to the climate. The period\r\nof the rains drew near; and in order to return to the coast of Cumana,\r\nit was necessary again to cross the Llanos, where, amidst\r\nhalf-inundated lands, it is rare to find shelter, or any other food\r\nthan meat dried in the sun. To avoid exposing M. Bonpland to a\r\ndangerous relapse, we resolved to stay at Angostura till the 10th of\r\nJuly. We spent part of this time at a neighbouring plantation, where\r\nmango-trees and bread-fruit trees* were cultivated. (* Artocarpus\r\nincisa. Father Andujar, Capuchin missionary of the province of\r\nCaracas, zealous in the pursuit of natural history, has introduced the\r\nbread-fruit tree from Spanish Guiana at Varinas, and thence into the\r\nkingdom of New Grenada. Thus the western Coasts of America, washed by\r\nthe Pacific, receive from the English Settlements in the West Indies a\r\nproduction of the Friendly Islands.) The latter had attained in the\r\ntenth year a height of more than forty feet. We measured several\r\nleaves of the Artocarpus that were three feet long and eighteen inches\r\nbroad, remarkable dimensions in a plant of the family of the\r\ndicotyledons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME 2.",
