C. RAND, CORNHILL, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preparing the following work, it was intended to present a systematic\r\nand somewhat complete statement of the principles of Geology, within\r\nsuch limits that they may be thoroughly studied in the time usually\r\nallotted to this science.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of leading facts has been introduced to enable the\r\nlearner to feel that every important principle is a conclusion to which\r\nhe has himself arrived; and yet, for the purpose of compression, that\r\nfullness of detail has been avoided with which more extended works\r\nabound. In furtherance of the same object, authorities are seldom cited.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of geological changes is made a distinct chapter,\r\nsubsequent to the one on the arrangement of materials. It should,\r\nhowever, be remembered that these processes of arranging and disturbing\r\nare not thus separated in time. In nature the two processes are always\r\ngoing on together.\r\n\r\nIt seemed important to exhibit the science with as much unity and\r\ncompleteness as possible; and hence, discussions upon debatable points\r\nin Theoretical Geology, so interesting to mature geologists, would have\r\nbeen out of place here; and yet those more intricate subjects have not\r\nbeen omitted. A large proportion of the work is devoted to the\r\nexplanation of geological phenomena, in order to convey an idea of the\r\nmodes of investigation adopted, and the kind of evidence relied on.\r\nWhere diversities of opinion exist, that view has been selected which\r\nseemed most in harmony with the facts; and the connection has not often\r\nbeen interrupted to combat, or even to state, the antagonist view.\r\n\r\nTechnical terms have, in a few instances, been introduced, and\r\nprinciples referred to, which are subsequently explained. The index\r\nwill, however, enable the student to understand them, without a separate\r\nglossary.\r\n\r\nSome may prefer to commence with the second chapter, deferring the study\r\nof the elementary substances, minerals and rocks, to the last. Such a\r\ncourse may be pursued without special inconvenience.\r\n\r\nQuestions have been added, for the convenience of those teachers who may\r\nprefer to conduct their recitations by this means. But, when the\r\ncircumstances of the case admit of it, a much more complete knowledge of\r\nthe subject will be acquired by pupils who are required to analyze the\r\nsections, and proceed with the recitation themselves; while the teacher\r\nhas only to correct misapprehension, explain what may seem obscure, and\r\nintroduce additional illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n   1.

A few of them are, however, so abundant, in the\r\ncomposition of the crust of the earth, as to render some attention to\r\nthem necessary.\r\n\r\n_Oxygen_ is more widely diffused than any other substance. It is an\r\ningredient of water and of the atmosphere, the former containing\r\neighty-eight per cent., and the latter twenty-one. Nearly all rocks\r\ncontain oxygen in combination with the metallic and metalloid bases, and\r\nthe average proportion of oxygen which they contain is about forty-five\r\nper cent.; so that it will not differ much from the truth to consider\r\nthe oxygen in the earth's crust as equal in weight to all the other\r\nsubstances which enter into its composition.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen_ occurs in nature principally in combination with oxygen,\r\nforming water. It is also an ingredient in bitumen and bituminous coal.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_ is confined almost entirely to the atmosphere, of which it\r\nforms four-fifths. It enters into the composition of some varieties of\r\ncoal, and is sparingly diffused in most fossiliferous rocks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important substances in nature is _carbon_. It\r\nconstitutes the principal part of all the varieties of coal, as well as\r\nof graphite, peat and bituminous matter. A much larger amount of carbon\r\nexists in the carbonic acid which is combined with the oxides of the\r\nmetalloids and metals. The most abundant of these compounds is\r\nlimestone, which contains about twelve per cent, of carbon.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of volcanoes _sulphur_ is found pure and in a\r\ncrystalline form. It is a constant ingredient in volcanic rocks, and in\r\nseveral of the most important ores, particularly those of lead, copper\r\nand iron. The most abundant sulphate is gypsum, which contains\r\ntwenty-six per cent, of sulphur. In small quantities it is widely\r\ndiffused in rocks, and in the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine_ is found principally as an ingredient of rock-salt, which\r\ncontains sixty per cent, of it, and of sea-water, which contains one and\r\na half per cent.\r\n\r\n_Fluorine_ is found, though very sparingly, in nearly all the\r\nunstratified rocks. It forms nearly half of the mineral known as\r\nDerbyshire spar.\r\n\r\nOf the metals, _Iron_ is the only one that is found abundantly. It\r\nenters into the composition of nearly all mineral substances. It is\r\ngenerally combined with oxygen, and occurs less frequently as a\r\ncarbonate or sulphuret. Of volcanic rocks it forms about twenty per\r\ncent. Its ores are sometimes found in the form of dikes or seams, having\r\nbeen injected from below; at other times, in the form of nodules or\r\nstratified masses, like other rocks of mechanical origin.\r\n\r\n_Manganese_ is likewise extensively diffused, but in very small\r\nquantity. The other metals are often met with, but their localities are\r\nof very limited extent.\r\n\r\nOf the metallic bases of the earths and alkalies, _Silicium_ is the most\r\nabundant. It generally occurs in the form of silex, which is an oxide of\r\nthe metal. There are but few rocks in which it is not found in\r\nconsiderable amount.\r\n\r\n_Aluminium_ generally occurs as an oxide, in which form it is alumina.\r\nIt is the base of the different varieties of clay and clay-slate. It is\r\nalso a constituent of felspar and mica.\r\n\r\n_Potassium_ is an ingredient of felspar and mica, and hence is found in\r\nall the primary and in most of the volcanic rocks, as well as in the\r\nstratified rocks derived from them.\r\n\r\n_Sodium_ is a constituent of a variety of felspar which is somewhat\r\nabundant in volcanic rocks. Its principal source is the extensive beds\r\nof rock-salt, and the same substance in a state of solution in the\r\nwaters of the ocean.\r\n\r\n_Calcium_ constitutes about forty per cent, of limestone, and is an\r\ningredient in nearly all igneous rocks. This metal, in the state of an\r\noxide, is lime.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium_ is somewhat abundant, but less so than calcium. It is one of\r\nthe bases of dolomite and magnesian limestone, and is an ingredient of\r\ntalc and all talcose rocks.\r\n\r\nThe substances now enumerated constitute nearly the entire mineral mass\r\nof the crust of the earth. They may be arranged in the following\r\norder:--\r\n\r\n  I. NON-METALLIC SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n    Oxygen.  Hydrogen.  Nitrogen.\r\n    Carbon.  Sulphur.   Chlorine.\r\n             Fluorine.\r\n\r\n  II. METALS.\r\n\r\n    Iron.  Manganese.\r\n\r\n  III. METALLIC BASES OF THE EARTHS AND ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n    Silicium.  Aluminium.  Potassium.\r\n    Sodium.    Calcium.    Magnesium.\r\n\r\nThese substances, chemically combined, form _Simple Minerals_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--SIMPLE MINERALS.\r\n\r\nAll substances found in the earth or upon its surface, which are not the\r\nproducts of art or of organic life, are regarded by the mineralogist as\r\n_simple minerals_. About four hundred mineral species are known, and the\r\nvarieties are much more numerous; but only a small number of them are so\r\nabundant as to claim the attention of the geologist. An acquaintance\r\nwith the following species is, however, necessary.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_ is probably the most abundant mineral in nature. It is composed\r\nwholly of silex. Its specific gravity is 2.65. It is the hardest of the\r\ncommon minerals, gives sparks with steel, scratches glass, and breaks\r\ninto irregular angular fragments under the hammer. When crystallized,\r\nits most common form is that of a six-sided prism, terminated by\r\nsix-sided pyramids. When pure, it is transparent or translucent, and its\r\nlustre is highly vitreous. The transparent variety is called _rock\r\ncrystal_. When purple, it is _amethyst_. When faint red, it is _rose\r\nquartz_. When its color is dark brown, or gray, and it has a conchoidal\r\nfracture, it is _flint_. When quartz occurs in white, tuberous masses,\r\nof a resinous lustre and conchoidal fracture, it is _opal_. The precious\r\nopal is distinguished by its lively play of colors. _Jasper_ is opaque,\r\nand contains a small per cent, of oxide of iron, by which it is colored\r\ndull red, yellowish red or brown. The light-colored, massive,\r\ntranslucent variety is _chalcedony_. The flesh-colored specimens are\r\n_carnelian_. When composed of layers of chalcedony of different colors,\r\nit becomes _agate_. Several of the varieties of quartz, such as\r\namethyst, opal, carnelian and agate, are used to considerable extent in\r\njewelry.\r\n\r\n_Felspar_ is composed of silex, alumina and potassa. It resembles\r\nquartz, but it is not as hard, cleaves more readily, and is not\r\ngenerally transparent. Its specific gravity is 2.47. Its lustre is\r\nfeebly vitreous, but pearly on its cleavage faces. Its color is\r\nsometimes green, but generally dull white, and often inclined to red or\r\nflesh-color.\r\n\r\n_Mica_ is composed of the same ingredients as felspar, together with\r\noxide of iron. Its specific gravity is nearly three. It is often\r\ncolorless, but frequently green, smoky, or black. It may be known by its\r\ncapability of division into exceedingly thin, transparent, elastic\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n_Hornblende_ is composed of silex, alumina and magnesia. Its specific\r\ngravity is a little above three. Its color is generally some shade of\r\ngreen. When dark green or black, whether in a massive or crystalline\r\nstate, it is _common hornblende_. When light green, it is _actinolite_.\r\nThe white variety is _tremolite_. When it is composed of flexible\r\nfibres, it is _asbestus_; and when the fibres have also a silky lustre,\r\nit is _amianthus_.\r\n\r\n_Augite_ or _Pyroxene_ has, till recently, been considered as a variety\r\nof hornblende. Its specific gravity is slightly different; its\r\ncomposition is the same, and in general appearance it is not easily\r\ndistinguished from hornblende. It has, however, been made a distinct\r\nspecies, because its crystalline form is different.\r\n\r\n_Hypersthene_ is composed of silex, magnesia and oxide of iron. Its\r\nspecific gravity is 3.38. It closely resembles hornblende. The lustre of\r\nits cleavage faces is metallic pearly. Its color is grayish or greenish\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n_Talc_ is composed of silex and magnesia. Its specific gravity is 2.7.\r\nIt resembles mica in its general appearance and in its lamellar\r\nstructure, but it is easily distinguished from it by its plates being\r\nnot elastic, and by its soapy feel. Its color is generally some shade of\r\ngreen. _Soapstone_ is an impure variety of talc, of a light gray color,\r\nearthy texture, and is unctuous to the touch. _Chlorite_, another impure\r\nvariety, is a dark green rock, massive, easily cut with a knife, and\r\nunctuous to the touch.\r\n\r\n_Serpentine_ is composed of silex and magnesia. Its specific gravity is\r\n2.55. It is generally massive, unctuous to the touch, and of a green\r\ncolor. It is often variegated with spots of green of different shades.\r\nWith a mixture of carbonate of lime it forms the _verd antique marble_.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Lime_, or common limestone, is composed of carbonic acid\r\nand lime. Its specific gravity is 2.65. It presents a great variety of\r\nforms. In a crystalline state it is generally transparent, and when so,\r\npossesses the property of double refraction. It may be distinguished\r\nfrom every other common species by its rapid effervescence with acids.\r\nIt readily cleaves parallel to all the faces of the primary form, which\r\nis a rhombohedron.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime_, or Gypsum, is composed of sulphuric acid and lime.\r\nIts specific gravity is 2.32. When crystalline, it has a pearly lustre,\r\nis transparent, and goes under the name of _Selenite_. _Common Gypsum_\r\nresembles the other earthy limestones, but it is softer, and may be\r\nreadily distinguished by its not effervescing with acids.\r\n\r\nTo the minerals now enumerated may be added the following, which are of\r\nfrequent occurrence, but not in great quantities; namely, carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, oxide of iron, iron pyrites, rock-salt, coal, bitumen, schorl\r\nand garnet.\r\n\r\nThese simple minerals, either in separate masses or mingled more or less\r\nintimately together, compose almost wholly the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--THE MINERAL MASSES WHICH FORM THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the structure of the earth which is accessible to man is\r\ncalled the _crust of the earth_.\r\n\r\nThe mineral masses which compose it, whether in a solid state, like\r\ngranite and limestone, or in a yielding state, like beds of sand and\r\nclay, are called _rocks_.\r\n\r\nThe _unstratified rocks_ are Granite, Hypersthene rock, Limestone and\r\nSerpentine, and the Trappean and Volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\n_Granite_ is a rock of a light gray color, and is composed of quartz,\r\nfelspar and mica, in variable proportions, confusedly crystallized\r\ntogether. The felspar is generally the predominant mineral. It is\r\nsometimes of a very coarse texture, the separate minerals occurring in\r\nmasses of a foot or more in diameter. At other times it is so\r\nfine-grained that the constituent minerals can scarcely be recognized by\r\nthe naked eye; and between these extremes there is every variety. The\r\nterm granite is not, however, confined to an aggregate of these three\r\nminerals. In some instances the felspar so predominates as almost to\r\nexclude the other minerals, when it is called _felspathic granite_. When\r\nthe quartz appears in the form of irregular and broken lines, somewhat\r\nresembling written characters, in a base of felspar, it is called\r\n_graphic granite_. When talc takes the place of mica, it is _talcose\r\ngranite_. When hornblende takes the place of mica, it is _syenite_.\r\nGranite or any rock becomes _porphyritic_ when it contains imbedded\r\ncrystals of felspar.\r\n\r\nThere is a rock of crystalline structure, like granite, but of a darker\r\ncolor, which is called _hypersthene rock_. It is composed of Labrador\r\nfelspar and hypersthene. The mineral species _serpentine_ and\r\n_limestone_ often occur unstratified in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic rocks_ consist of the materials ejected from the craters of\r\nvolcanoes. They are composed of essentially the same minerals as trap\r\nrocks. When the material has been thrown out in a melted state, it is\r\ncalled _lava_. Lava, at the time of its ejection, contains a large\r\namount of watery vapor at a high temperature. Under the immense pressure\r\nto which it is subjected in the volcanic foci, it may exist in the form\r\nof water; but when the lava is thrown out at the crater, the pressure\r\ncannot much exceed that of the atmosphere. The particles of water at\r\nonce assume the gaseous form. As lava possesses considerable viscidity,\r\nthe steam does not escape, but renders the upper portion of the mass\r\nvesicular. This vesicular lava is called _scoriæ_. By the movement of\r\nthe stream of lava, these vesicles become drawn out into fine capillary\r\ntubes, converting the scoriæ into _pumice-stone_.\r\n\r\nA large part of the materials ejected from volcanoes is in the form of\r\ndust, cinders and angular fragments of rock. These soon become\r\nsolidified, forming _volcanic tuff_, or _volcanic breccia_. In submarine\r\neruptions these fragments are spread out by the water into strata, upon\r\nwhich other materials, not volcanic, are afterwards deposited. These\r\ninterposed strata are called volcanic grits.\r\n\r\nThe _trappean rocks_ are composed of felspar, mingled intimately and in\r\nsmall particles with augite or hornblende. They also contain iron and\r\npotassa. They are often _porphyritic_. When they contain spherical\r\ncavities, filled with some other mineral, such as chlorite, carbonate of\r\nlime or agate, they are called _amygdaloidal trap_.\r\n\r\nThe principal varieties of trappean rock are basalt, green stone, and\r\ntrachyte. In _basalt_, augite, or, in some cases, hornblende, is the\r\npredominant mineral. It is a heavy, close-grained rock, of a black or\r\ndark brown color. _Greenstone_ differs from basalt in containing a much\r\nlarger proportion of felspar. Its structure is more granular, and\r\nfrequently it assumes so much of the crystalline form as to pass\r\ninsensibly into syenite or granite. It is a dark colored rock, with a\r\nslight tinge of green. Both green stone and basalt are disposed to\r\nassume the columnar form, the columns being arranged at right angles to\r\nthe faces of the fissure into which the trap is injected. When it is\r\nspread out into broad horizontal masses, the columns are vertical. (Fig.\r\n1.) _Trachyte_ is composed principally of felspar, is of a grayish\r\ncolor, and rough to the touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nOf the _stratified_ rocks the following are the most important:\r\n\r\n_Gneiss_ is a rock closely resembling granite. It is an aggregate of the\r\nsame minerals, but the proportion of mica is somewhat greater. The only\r\ndistinction between them is that the gneiss is stratified, but the\r\nstratification is often so indistinct that it passes insensibly into\r\ngranite. Generally, however, the stratification is so distinct as to\r\npresent a marked difference.\r\n\r\n_Mica slate_ is such a modification of gneiss that the mica becomes the\r\npredominant mineral, with a small intermixture of quartz and felspar.\r\nConsequently the stratification becomes very distinct, so as sometimes\r\nto render the mass divisible into thin sheets. The stratification is\r\noften wavy, and sometimes much contorted.\r\n\r\n_Sandstone_ consists of grains or fragments of any other rock, but more\r\nfrequently of siliceous rocks. The fragments are consolidated, sometimes\r\nwithout any visible cement, but often by a paste of argillaceous or\r\ncalcareous substance. The color varies with that of the rock from which\r\nit was derived. Generally, however, it is either drab or is colored red\r\nby oxide of iron. The fragments are sometimes so minute as scarcely to\r\ngive the rock the appearance of sandstone. When they are of considerable\r\nsize and rounded, the rock is called _conglomerate_. When they are\r\nangular, it is called _breccia_. _Greensand_ is a friable mixture of\r\nsiliceous and calcareous particles, colored by a slight intermixture of\r\ngreen earth or chlorite.\r\n\r\n_Limestone_ is a very abundant rock, and occurs in many different forms.\r\nIn transparent crystals it is _Iceland spar_. When white and\r\ncrystalline, it is _primary limestone_, _saccharine limestone_, or\r\n_statuary marble_. When sub-crystalline it is generally more or less\r\ncolored. It is often _clouded_ with bands or patches of white in a\r\nground of some dark color. When its texture is close, and the\r\ncrystallization scarcely apparent, it is _compact limestone_. The white,\r\nearthy variety is chalk. A variety of limestone composed of small\r\nspheres is called _oölite_. _Lias_ is the name given to an impure\r\nargillaceous variety of a brown or blue color. Any rock which contains a\r\nconsiderable proportion of carbonate of lime, and which rapidly\r\ndisintegrates on exposure to the atmosphere, is called _marl_. Limestone\r\nsometimes contains carbonate of magnesia. It is then _magnesian\r\nlimestone_, or _dolomite_.\r\n\r\n_Clay_ consists of a mixture of siliceous and aluminous earth. It is\r\ntough, highly plastic, and generally of a lead blue color. It is always\r\nstratified, and often divided into very thin laminæ, which are\r\nseparated by sprinklings of sand only sufficient to keep them distinct.\r\n\r\n_Clay slate_, or _argillaceous schist_, is composed of the same\r\nmaterials as clay, and differs from it only in having become solidified.\r\nIts color is gray, dark brown or black. In some beds it is purple.\r\n_Shale_ is the same material in a state of partial solidification. On\r\nexposure to the weather, it soon disintegrates, and is finally\r\nreconverted into clay. All the varieties of argillaceous rock are easily\r\ndistinguished by a peculiar odor which they emit when breathed upon.\r\n\r\nArgillaceous slate sometimes takes into its composition portions of some\r\nother mineral, such as talc, mica, or hornblende. When any of these\r\nminerals becomes so abundant as to constitute a considerable part of the\r\nmass, the rock becomes _talcose_, _micaceous_, or _hornblende slate_.\r\nSometimes this last variety loses all appearance of a fissile structure,\r\nand is composed almost wholly of hornblende. It is then called\r\n_hornblende rock_.\r\n\r\n_Diluvium_ is the name applied to masses of sand, gravel, and large\r\nrocks, called boulders, heaped confusedly together on the surface of the\r\nearth. It is also called _drift_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE MATERIALS WHICH COMPOSE THE CRUST OF THE\r\nEARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--THE CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we divide rocks into _stratified_ and\r\n_unstratified_. This division is one which will in general be easily\r\nrecognized, even by the most inexperienced observer; and the distinction\r\nis important, because it separates the rocks of igneous origin from\r\nthose which have been produced by deposition of sediment from water.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown hereafter that a part of the unstratified rocks have\r\nbeen formed at or near the surface of the earth; that is, they have\r\ntaken their present form by passing from a state of fusion to a solid\r\nstate above or between the stratified rocks, as in the case of lava\r\n(Fig. 2, A). The other unstratified rocks have cooled so as to take the\r\nsolid form below the stratified rocks, as at B. The first are called\r\n_epigene_, or _volcanic rocks_; the last, _hypogene_, or _plutonic\r\nrocks_.\r\n\r\nThe lowest portion of the second division, the stratified rocks, are\r\ntermed _non-fossiliferous_, from the fact that they contain no evidence\r\nof the existence of organic beings at the time when they were deposited.\r\nTheir relation to the other rocks is shown at C. It is supposed that\r\nthese rocks have been subjected to great changes by heat from the\r\nigneous rocks below them. On this account Mr. Lyell proposes to call\r\nthem _metamorphic rocks_. The other portions of the stratified rocks are\r\n_fossiliferous_, containing the remains of organic beings which lived at\r\nthe period when the rocks were deposited. They are represented at D. The\r\ndivision of the last-named rocks info groups will be given hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nWe have then four principal classes of rocks: _Plutonic Rocks_,\r\n_Volcanic Rocks_, _Non-fossiliferous Stratified Rocks_ and\r\n_Fossiliferous Rocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--THE PLUTONIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nGranite is by far the most important of this class of rocks. Of its\r\nthickness no estimate can be made, as no mining operations have ever\r\npenetrated through it, and none of the most extensive displacements of\r\nrocks by natural causes has brought to the surface any other rock on\r\nwhich it rests. It may, therefore, be considered the foundation rock,\r\nthe skeleton of the earth, upon which all the other formations are\r\nsupported. The whole amount of granite in the earth's crust may be\r\ngreater than that of all other rocks, but it comes up through the other\r\nformations so as to be exposed over only a comparatively small portion\r\nof the surface, and this is generally the central portion of mountain\r\nranges, or the highest parts of broken, hill country. Still, it is not\r\nunfrequently found in the more level regions, in the form of slightly\r\nelevated ridges, with the stratified rocks reclining against it.\r\n\r\nThe structure of granite seems frequently to be a confused mixture of\r\nthe minerals which compose it, without any approach to order in their\r\narrangement; but in many cases it is found to split freely in certain\r\ndirections, and to work with difficulty in any other. This may result\r\nfrom an arrangement of the integrant crystals, so that their cleavage\r\nplanes approach more or less nearly to parallelism. When this is the\r\ncase with the mica or felspar, it must diminish the cohesion in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to these planes, and thus facilitate the\r\ncleavage of the mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nGranite is found to penetrate the stratified rocks in the form of veins.\r\nThe following section (Fig. 3) will show the relation of granite veins\r\nto the granitic mass below. The granite which is quarried for\r\narchitectural purposes is often in comparatively small quantities,\r\ndisappearing at the distance of a few hundred yards beneath the\r\nstratified rock; or else it exists in the form of isolated dome-shaped\r\nmasses. It is probable that, if they could be followed sufficiently far,\r\nthey would be found to be portions of dikes coming from the general mass\r\nof granite below. Even the granite nuclei of the great mountain ranges\r\nmay be considered as injected dikes of enormous magnitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nGranite is itself intersected with granite veins more frequently,\r\nperhaps, than any other rocks; but the vein is a coarser granite than\r\nthe rock which it divides. It is not uncommon to find one set of dikes\r\nintercepted and cut off by a second set, and the second by a third. The\r\nsubstance of the dikes was, of course, in a liquid state when it was\r\ninjected, and the first must have become solid before the second was\r\nthrown in; hence the dikes are of different ages. The dikes _a b c_,\r\nrepresented in Fig. 4, must have been injected in the order in which\r\nthey are lettered.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, by the process of cooling, the liquid mass from\r\nwhich these dikes have proceeded has been gradually solidifying from the\r\nsurface downwards. If so, it would follow that the granite nearest the\r\nsurface (1, Fig. 2) is the oldest, and the newest is that which is at\r\nthe greatest distance below (4). It is possible that at great depths\r\ngranite may be still forming, that is, taking the solid form, though of\r\nthis there can be no direct proof. There is, however, proof that it has\r\nbeen liquid at periods of time very distant from each other; for the\r\ndikes sometimes reach to the top of the coal formation (for example),\r\nand then spread themselves out horizontally, as at _a_, showing that the\r\nrock above the coal had not then been deposited. Another dike will\r\nextend through the new red sandstone, as at _b_, and spread itself out\r\nhorizontally as before. These horizontal layers of granite, by their\r\nposition in strata whose ages are known, indicate the periods when\r\ngranite has existed in a liquid state. Granite veins have been\r\ndiscovered in the Pyrenees as recent as the close of the cretaceous\r\nperiod, and in the Andes they have been found among the tertiary rocks.\r\n\r\nThere are several other rocks, of minor importance, often found in\r\nconnection with granite. Hypersthene rock, in a few cases, forms the\r\nprincipal part of mountain masses. Greenstone is more frequently\r\nassociated with the trappean rocks, but it sometimes passes\r\nimperceptibly into syenite and common granite. Limestone is found in\r\nconsiderable abundance, and serpentine in small quantities, as primary\r\nrocks, and have evidently been formed like granite, by solidifying from\r\na state of fusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--THE VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic rocks consist of materials ejected from volcanoes. They\r\nare, however, ejected in very _different states_; sometimes as dust,\r\nsand, angular fragments of rock, cinders, &c., and sometimes as lava\r\nstreams. In some instances, the lava has so little fluidity that it\r\naccumulates in a dome-shaped mass over the orifice of eruption, and\r\nperhaps in a few instances it has been thrust upward in a solid state.\r\n\r\nThere are _two principal varieties_ of lava, the trachytic, consisting\r\nmostly of felspar, and the basaltic, consisting of hornblende. When both\r\nkinds are products of the same eruption, the trachytic lava is thrown\r\nout first, and the basaltic last. The reason of this is, that felspar\r\nis lighter than hornblende, and probably rises to the surface of the\r\nlava mass at the volcanic focus, and the basaltic lava is therefore\r\nreserved till the trachytic has been thrown off.\r\n\r\nThese, like other rocks, have been produced at different epochs. There\r\nis, however, great difficulty in determining their age; There are some\r\ndifferences of structure and composition observed, in comparing the\r\nolder and newer lavas; but the only method that can be relied on to\r\ndetermine their age is their relation to other rocks. When they occur\r\nbetween strata whose age is determined by imbedded fossils, they must be\r\nof intermediate age between the inferior and superior strata.\r\n\r\n1. _Modern Volcanic Rocks._--Some of the volcanic rocks are of modern\r\norigin, and are produced by volcanoes now active. The total amount of\r\nthese, and of all the other volcanic rocks, is probably less than that\r\nof either of the other principal divisions of rocks; yet they form no\r\ninconsiderable part of the earth's crust. The number of active volcanoes\r\nis not far from three hundred, and the number of eruptions annually is\r\nestimated at about twenty. In some cases, the lava consists of only a\r\nsingle stream, of but a few hundred yards in extent. It extends,\r\nhowever, not unfrequently twenty miles in length, and two or three\r\nhundred yards in breadth. The eruption of Mount Loa, on the island of\r\nHawaii, in 1840, from the crater of Kilauea, covered an area of fifteen\r\nsquare miles to the depth of twelve feet; and another eruption of the\r\nsame mountain, in 1843, covered an area of at least fifty square miles.\r\nThe eruption in Iceland, in 1783, continued in almost incessant activity\r\nfor a year, and sent off two streams in opposite directions, which\r\nreached a distance of fifty miles in one case, and of forty in the\r\nother, with a width varying from three to fifteen miles, and with an\r\naverage depth of more than a hundred feet. The size of some of the\r\nvolcanic mountains will also assist in forming an idea of the amount of\r\nvolcanic rocks. Monte Nuovo, near Naples, which is a mile and a half in\r\ncircumference and four hundred and forty feet high, was thrown up in a\r\nsingle day. Ætna, which is eleven thousand feet high, and eighty-seven\r\nmiles in circumference at its base, has probably been produced wholly\r\nby its own eruptions. A large part of the chain of the Andes consists of\r\nvolcanic rock, but the proportion we have not the means of estimating.\r\n\r\n2. _Tertiary Lavas._--There is another class of volcanic products, which\r\nare so situated with reference to the tertiary strata that they must be\r\nreferred to that period. The principal localities of these lavas, so far\r\nas yet known, are Italy, Spain, Central France, Hungary, and Germany.\r\nThey are also found in South America. Those of Central France have been\r\nstudied with the most care. They occur in several groups, but they were\r\nthe seats of volcanic activity during the same epoch, and formed parts\r\nof one extensive volcanic region. Each of these minor areas, embracing a\r\ncircle of twenty or thirty miles in diameter, is covered with hills two\r\nor three thousand feet in height, which are composed entirely of\r\nvolcanic products, like the cone of Ætna. On many of them there are\r\nperfectly-formed craters still remaining. Numerous streams of lava have\r\nflowed from these craters, some of which can now be traced, throughout\r\ntheir whole extent, with as much certainty as if they were eruptions of\r\nthe present century. Some of the lavas have accumulated around the\r\norifices of eruption, forming rounded, dome-shaped eminences. These\r\nlavas generally consist of trachyte, and have therefore a low specific\r\ngravity, and imperfect fluidity. The basaltic lavas have often spread\r\nout over broad areas, and, when they have been confined in valleys, have\r\nreached a distance of fifteen miles or more from their source. There\r\nstill remain indications of a current of lava which was thirty miles\r\nlong, six broad, and in a part of its course from four to six hundred\r\nfeet deep. The above sketch (Fig. 5) will give some idea of the highly\r\nvolcanic aspect which the district of Auvergne, in France, presents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe unimpaired state of some of the cones and craters, and of the lava\r\ncurrents, would lead to the impression that these regions have been the\r\ntheatre of intense volcanic action within a very recent period. But\r\nthere is good reason to believe that this has not been the case. \"The\r\nhigh antiquity of the most modern of these volcanoes is indeed\r\nsufficiently obvious. Had any of them been in a state of activity in the\r\nage of Julius Cæsar, that general, who encamped upon the plains of\r\nAuvergne and laid siege to its principal city, could hardly have failed\r\nto notice them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is equally certain that the commencement of their activity was at a\r\nlate period in the history of the earth. Lava currents are frequently\r\nfound in France resting upon the early tertiary strata, but no lava\r\ncurrent is found below them. The later tertiary strata contain pebbles\r\nof volcanic rocks, showing that lavas had been previously ejected, but\r\nnone are found in the older strata of this formation. We must,\r\ntherefore, conclude that these volcanic tracts assumed their volcanic\r\ncharacter at some intermediate point in the tertiary period.\r\n\r\nWhen we find that their activity commenced at so late a period and\r\nclosed so long ago, we might be led to suppose that it was of very short\r\nduration. But a great number of facts, in the present condition of the\r\ncountry, require that we should assign to them a very prolonged\r\nactivity. A single instance will be sufficient to show the nature of the\r\nevidence upon which this conclusion rests. The heavy line (Fig. 6)\r\nrepresents the present form of one of the valleys. A bed of lava forms\r\nthe highest point of land represented, and a second bed is found in an\r\nintermediate part of the slope. The position of the upper bed must have\r\nbeen a valley, when the lava flowed there. We may represent this valley\r\nby the line _a b c_. The slow operation of natural denuding causes at\r\nlength excavated the valley _d e h_, when another lava current flowed\r\nthrough it, covering its bed of pebbles, as before. The same denuding\r\ncauses have at length produced the present valley, _f g h_. These\r\nremnants of lava-currents, as they have formed a very imperishable rock,\r\nhave protected the subjacent strata from erosion, and furnish evidence\r\nof the position of the valley at different periods. When we consider\r\nwith what extreme slowness denuding causes produce changes on the\r\nsurface, and what extensive changes they have here nevertheless effected\r\nin the interval between the production of the different lava currents,\r\nwe are compelled to feel that that interval was a very prolonged one.\r\nYet this period, however long it may have been, was evidently less than\r\nthe period of activity of these volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n3. _Volcanic rocks of an earlier date_ are also found, sometimes as\r\ndistinct lavas, though generally as volcanic grits. They occur\r\ninterstratified with the cretaceous rocks, and with every other\r\nformation of the fossiliferous series, showing that, from the earliest\r\ntimes, these rocks have been accumulating as they now are.\r\n\r\n_The trappean rocks_ may, in a general classification, be considered as\r\nvolcanic. It will be shown, hereafter, that they are the lavas of\r\nsubmarine volcanoes. They do not, however, occur in the form of lava\r\ncurrents, but in great tabular masses, generally between stratified\r\nrocks, or in the form of dikes. They are also entirely unconnected with\r\ncones or craters.\r\n\r\nThe trappean rocks occur more or less abundantly in all countries. One\r\nof the most noted localities of this rock is a region embracing the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and several of the islands on the western coast of\r\nScotland. It contains the celebrated Giant's Causeway, which consists of\r\na mass of columnar trap; also Fingal's Cave, which is produced by a\r\nportion of the trap being columnar, and thus disintegrating more rapidly\r\nthan the rest, by the action of the waves. An immense mass of greenstone\r\ntrap, which has generally been considered as a vast dike, though often a\r\nmile in thickness, is found extending from New Haven to Northampton, on\r\nthe west side of the Connecticut river. It then crosses to the east\r\nside, and continues in a northerly direction to the Massachusetts line.\r\nUnder different names, it constitutes a nearly continuous and\r\nprecipitous mountain range for about one hundred miles. Dr. Hitchcock\r\nsupposes this greenstone range to be, not an injected dike, but a\r\ntabular mass of ancient lava, which was spread out on the bed of the\r\nocean during the period of the deposition of the Connecticut river\r\nsandstone. It was subsequently covered with a deposit of strata of great\r\nthickness, and then by subterranean forces thrown into its present\r\ninclined position.\r\n\r\nThere is a mass of basaltic rock in the valley of the Columbia river, in\r\nthe Oregon Territory, which extends without interruption for a distance\r\nof four hundred miles. Its breadth and thickness is not known, but in\r\nsome places the river has cut a channel in this rock to a depth of four\r\nhundred feet. Its age has not been determined, and it will, perhaps, be\r\nfound to be a tertiary or modern production.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--THE NON-FOSSILIFEROUS STRATIFIED (OR METAMORPHIC) ROCKS.\r\n\r\n1. _Gneiss_ is the most abundant rock in this class, and is generally\r\nfound reposing on granite. Its stratification is sometimes very\r\ndistinct, but it is often so imperfect that it can scarcely be\r\nrecognized. This is more frequently the case in the vicinity of granite\r\non which it rests, and into which it insensibly passes. A large part of\r\nthe material used for building purposes, under the name of granite, is\r\nobscurely marked gneiss. In all primary countries it is an abundant\r\nrock, occupying extensive districts, and sometimes forming mountain\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\n2. _Mica slate_ lies next above gneiss, and is a very abundant rock. As\r\nit differs from gneiss only in the proportion of mica which it contains,\r\nand as the quantity of mica in it is very different in different places,\r\nit is often difficult to make the distinction between them. It also\r\npasses by insensible degrees into the argillaceous rocks. Many of the\r\nargillaceous rocks are found, upon close examination, to contain mica in\r\nminute scales in such abundance as to make it doubtful whether they\r\nought not to be regarded as mica slates; that is, the metamorphic action\r\nby which argillaceous slate is converted into mica slate had proceeded\r\nso far, before it was arrested, that it becomes impossible to say\r\nwhether the argillaceous or micaceous characters predominate.\r\n\r\n3. _Argillaceous slate._--The last rock of this series is a slaty rock,\r\nmore or less highly argillaceous. It does not differ in lithological\r\ncharacters from the same rock in the higher strata. It is doubtful\r\nwhether the roofing-slates should be considered as belonging to the\r\nmetamorphic series or not. They have been subjected to a very high\r\ndegree of metamorphic action, and yet strata intimately associated with\r\nthem have, in occasional instances, contained fossils.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to fix the exact upper limit of this series. The fossils\r\nare few, obscure, and seldom met with in the lowest fossiliferous\r\nseries; and the transition is very gradual from the distinctly\r\nmetamorphic to the fossiliferous rocks. This renders it impossible\r\nalways to determine accurately the line of separation.\r\n\r\nThe gneiss, mica slate and argillaceous slate, have the order of\r\nsuperposition in which they are here named. They differ only in the\r\namount of metamorphic action to which they have been subjected; and the\r\ngneiss which is most highly metamorphic has, by being the lowest, been\r\nmost acted upon,--the mica slate less, and the argillaceous slate least.\r\nIn a particular locality, however, the lowest rock which was subjected\r\nto these causes of change, instead of having been of such a character as\r\nto produce gneiss, may have been a limestone, and in that case the\r\nlowest metamorphic rock would be a saccharine marble. In another\r\nlocality the lowest rock may have been a sandstone, which would be\r\nconverted into quartz rock. Hence there may occur, in any part of the\r\nmetamorphic series, crystalline limestone, quartz rock, hornblende\r\nslate, chlorite slate, and talcose slate; and any one of these rocks may\r\nbe as abundant in any particular region, as gneiss, mica slate or\r\nargillaceous slate, is in another.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks occur in all countries where there has been any\r\nconsiderable amount of volcanic action, and their total amount is very\r\ngreat; but their stratification is so confused and contorted, their\r\nsuperposition so irregular, and denudations have been so extensive, that\r\nno estimate can be made of their thickness. They are, perhaps, equal to\r\nall the other stratified rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--THE FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe fossiliferous rocks are divided into seven systems, which are\r\nreadily distinguished by the order of superposition, lithological\r\ncharacters and organic remains. These systems are the Silurian, the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, the Carboniferous, the New Red Sandstone, the Oölitic,\r\nthe Cretaceous, and the Tertiary systems. There is also an eighth system\r\nnow in process of formation.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of some geologists that there is another system\r\nsituated between the metamorphic rocks and the silurian system. It has\r\nbeen called by Dr. Emmons, who has studied it with much care, the\r\n\"Taconic System,\" the Taconic Mountains, in the western part of\r\nMassachusetts, being composed of these rocks. It is the lower part of\r\nwhat has been called, in England and Wales, the _Cambrian system_.\r\n\r\nThe strata of this system have a nearly vertical position, and consist\r\nprincipally of black, greenish and purple slates, of great thickness.\r\nGranular quartz rock, however, occurs in considerable quantity, and in\r\nthis country two thick and important beds of limestone are found. These\r\nlimestones are occasionally white and crystalline. Generally, however,\r\nas a mass, they are a dark, nearly black rock, with a network of lines\r\nof a lighter color. All the clouded marbles for architectural and\r\nornamental purposes are from these beds, and our roofing and writing\r\nslates are all obtained from the argillaceous portion of this system.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of organic remains contained in this system is\r\nvery small, and these, so far as discovered, belong to the annelida,\r\nwith a few doubtful cases of mollusca. This system of rocks is found\r\ncoming to the surface in a large part of New England, and the eastern\r\npart of New York, also in the western part of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThose geologists who deny the existence of this system consider these\r\nrocks as parts of the silurian system which have been most disturbed by\r\nsubterranean forces, and most altered by proximity to igneous rocks. The\r\nannexed sketch (Fig. 7) will exhibit the relations here referred to.\r\nCertain portions of the silurian rocks are supposed to have been thrown\r\ninto folds by the upheaval of the primary rocks. The plications nearest\r\nto the intrusive granite would be most altered. That part of the figure\r\nbelow the line _a a_ represents the outcropping edges as they now\r\nappear, the upper portion of the folds having been removed by some\r\nabrading cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nAs it is yet uncertain which of these views is correct, convenience will\r\njustify us in retaining the name of Cambrian system till further\r\ninvestigations shall settle the question.\r\n\r\n1. _The Silurian System._--The following tabular arrangement exhibits\r\nthe divisions of the system as recognized in England, in New York, in\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, and in Ohio.\r\n\r\n  Key to Divisions\r\n  ----------------\r\n  C  - Cambrian Rocks.\r\n  S  - Silurian System.\r\n  D  - Devonian.\r\n  Ch - Champlain Division.\r\n  On - Ontario Division.\r\n  He - Helderberg Division.\r\n  Er - Erie Division.\r\n\r\n   Divisions as recognized  Divisions as recognized  Pennsylvania  Ohio.\r\n   by English Authors.      by the New York          and Virginia.\r\n                             Geologists.\r\n    /-------------------\\ /-----------------------\\ /----------\\ /--------\\\r\n    { Upper Cambrian    {  { Potsdam Sandstone.     } No. 1.\r\n    {                   {  {\r\n  C { Rocks, of Sedgwick{  { Calciferous Sandrock.  }\r\n    {                   {  { Birdseye Limestone.    } No. 2.   }\r\n    { (probably).       {Ch{ Trenton Limestone.     }          } Blue\r\n                        {  {                                   } Limestone\r\n    { Llandeilo Flags.  {  { Utica Slate.           }          } and Marl.\r\n    {                   {  {                        } No. 3.   }\r\n    {                      { Hudson River Group.    }\r\n    {                   {\r\n    {                   {  { Gray Sandstone.        } No. 4.\r\n    {                   {  { Oneida Conglomerate.   }\r\n    {                   {On{\r\n    { Caradoc Sandstone.{  { Medina Sandstone.      } No. 5.\r\n    {                   {  { Clinton Group.         }\r\n    {                      { Niagara Group.\r\n    {                   {                           }          }\r\n    {                   {  { Oneida Salt Group.     }          :\r\n    {                   {  { Water-lime Group.      }          :\r\n    {                   {  { Pentamerus Limestone.  } No. 6.   :\r\n    {                   {  { Delthyris Shaly        }          :\r\n    {                   {  {   Limestone.           }          :\r\n  S {                   {  { Encrinal Limestone.    }          : Cliff\r\n    { Wenlock Rocks.    {He{ Upper Pentamerus       }          :\r\n    {                   {  {   Limestone.                      : Limestone.\r\n    {                   {  { Oriskany Sandstone.    }          :\r\n    {                   {  {                        } No. 7.   :\r\n    {                   {  { Cauda-Galli Grit.      }          :\r\n    {                   {  { Schoharie Grit.        }          :\r\n    {                   {  { Onondaga Limestone.

But it is now used to\r\nembrace the whole system as it occurs elsewhere. It is well exhibited in\r\nNew York, both in consequence of its great development there, and\r\nbecause the whole system is only slightly acted upon by disturbing\r\nforces, so that the outcropping edge of each division extends over a\r\nlarge surface.\r\n\r\nThis system is of great thickness, amounting, in places where it is well\r\ndeveloped, to twenty thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe Champlain division commences with a quartzose sandstone, passing\r\ngradually into limestone, which is succeeded by a very thick\r\nargillaceous deposit, the Utica slate and Hudson River group. The\r\nOntario division in the lower part is a mass of sandstone. Above this is\r\nthe Clinton group, consisting of shales and sandstones. The most\r\nimportant part of this group, in an economical point of view, is a\r\nfossiliferous, argillaceous iron ore, coextensive with the group in this\r\ncountry, and is worked to supply a large number of furnaces. The last of\r\nthe division is the Niagara group, which commences with a mass of shale,\r\nand becoming at length calcareous, it terminates in a firm compact\r\nlimestone. This limestone has withstood the action of denuding causes\r\nbetter than the shales either above or below it. It therefore presents a\r\nbold escarpment at its outcrop, and occasions waterfalls wherever\r\nstreams of water cross it. The falls of Niagara are formed by this rock.\r\nThe Niagara limestone, in its extension westward, becomes the\r\nlead-bearing rock of Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin. The Helderberg\r\ndivision is a succession of highly fossiliferous limestones, with the\r\nintervention of only occasional beds of grits and shales. One member of\r\nthe series is the Onondaga Salt group. The water obtained from this\r\ngroup in New York annually furnishes immense quantities of salt. The\r\nErie division consists of a thick mass of shales and sandstones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils of this system are very numerous, but consist mostly of the\r\nlower forms of animal life. _Corals_ (Figs. 8 and 9) are abundant, and\r\nconstitute in some places a large proportion of the limestones. The\r\n_Crinoidea_, or lily-shaped animals, consist of a jointed stem\r\npermanently attached, and bearing at the free extremity of the stem an\r\nexpanded portion, which is the pelvis, or digestive cavity. The mouth is\r\nsurrounded with a series of leaf-like tentacula, which serve the purpose\r\nof seizing and holding food. Fig. 10 represents the pelvis of one of the\r\nsilurian fossils. The general character of the animal is better\r\nrepresented by Fig. 30. The most abundant fossils of this period are the\r\nlowest orders of _bivalve mollusca_ (Fig. 11). The _Cephalopoda_ are\r\ncharacterized by having the organs of locomotion attached to the head.\r\nThe shell of several species is peculiar in being divided into distinct\r\ncells, or chambers (Fig. 12, _b d_), perforated by a tube (siphuncle\r\n_a_). These fossil shells are sometimes straight, as the _Orthoceras_\r\n(Fig. 13), or curved, as shown in the several forms of Fig. 14. The\r\n_Trilobite_ was an articulated, crustaceous animal, having two lines\r\nalong the back dividing it into three lobes, from which circumstance its\r\nname is derived. It is found in great numbers in the Silurian rocks\r\n(Fig. 15). In a few instances remains of fishes have been found, but\r\nthey by no means characterize the system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe geographical range of this system is probably greater than that of\r\nany system of rocks above it. It is found occupying a large part of the\r\nterritory west of the Alleghany Mountains, from Canada, through New\r\nYork, and the other states, to Alabama; and extending westward to and\r\nbeyond the Mississippi river. It occupies a large district in the west\r\nof England, and is found in great force in the north and east of Europe.\r\n\r\n2. _The Old Red Sandstone._--This formation consists almost entirely of\r\na sandstone of a red color. It admits of division into three parts,\r\nthough the characters vary in different places. The lowest is a\r\nthin-bedded argillaceous sandstone, consisting of finely levigated\r\nmaterial, and easily splitting into thin sheets. From this circumstance\r\nit has received the name of _tilestone_. The middle portion is composed\r\nof nodules or concretions of limestone imbedded in a paste of red sand\r\nand shale. This has been called by English geologists, _cornstone_, and\r\nthough very partially developed in some regions where the system is\r\nfound, it is yet a very persistent member. The highest member of this\r\nformation is a mass of red sandstone, often passing into a coarse\r\n_conglomerate_. In England the thickness of the Old Red Sandstone is not\r\nless than ten thousand feet. In this country it is scarcely three\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils of this system are a few shells, a small number of vegetable\r\nspecies, and in particular localities the remains of fishes in great\r\nabundance. The system is characterized principally by fossils of this\r\nlast kind. The fishes of this system have a cartilaginous skeleton, but\r\nare covered with plates of bone, which were faced externally with\r\nenamel. The jaws, which consisted of solid bone, were not covered with\r\nintegument. The exterior bony covering seems to have been the true\r\nskeleton, as is, in part, the case with the tortoise. In some of the\r\nfishes of this period there is a wing-like expansion on each side of the\r\nneck, which has given them the name of _Pterychthis_ (Fig. 17). In\r\nothers, as the _Cephalaspis_, the plate of bone on the back is so large\r\nas to cover nearly the whole body, and make it resemble a trilobite\r\n(Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThis system has an extensive geographical range. In England, it occupies\r\na band of several miles in width, extending from the Welsh border\r\nnorthward through Scotland to the Orkney Islands. In this country, it\r\nforms the Catskill Mountains, in New York, and extends south and west so\r\nas to underlie the coal-fields of Pennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\n3. _The Carboniferous System._--This system consists of three parts,\r\ndistinguished by lithological and fossil characters.\r\n\r\nThe _carboniferous limestone_ is a dark-colored, compact limestone,\r\nforming the base of the system, and reposing on the old red sandstone.\r\nIts thickness is from six hundred to one thousand feet, often with\r\nscarcely any intermixture of other rock; but it sometimes loses its\r\ncharacter of a limestone, and becomes a sandstone, or conglomerate. It\r\ngenerally contains the ores of lead in considerable quantity, and from\r\nthis circumstance has been called _metalliferous limestone_. In England\r\nit is the principal repository of these ores. In the Western States it\r\nis the upper portion of the lead-bearing strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils are marine, and very numerous. Corals and crinoidea are very\r\nabundant. The crinoidea, in some localities, form so large a part of the\r\nrock as to have given to it the name of encrinal limestone. The\r\northoceras and trilobite are found, but become extinct with this\r\nformation. Several species of bivalves, such as Delthyris and Leptæna,\r\nare also common.\r\n\r\nNext above the limestone lies the sandstone, sometimes called _millstone\r\ngrit_. It is generally drab-colored, but occasionally red. Its thickness\r\nis often equal to that of the limestone. Sometimes it is fine-grained\r\nand compact; but generally it is coarse-grained, and often passes into a\r\nconglomerate. It contains but few fossils, and those of vegetable\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe highest part of the system is the _coal measures_. They consist of\r\nbeds of sandstone, limestone, shale, clay, ironstone and coal, occurring\r\nwithout much uniformity in their order of superposition. The coal\r\nmeasures have a thickness of about three thousand feet. The sandstones\r\nand limestones are not distinguishable from the sandstones and\r\nlimestones in the lower part of the system. The ironstone either occurs\r\nin concretionary nodules, often formed around some organic nucleus, or\r\nit is an argillaceous ore, having a slaty structure. In either case, it\r\nconsists of subordinate beds in the shale. The coal consists of several\r\nbeds distributed through the measures. The beds vary in thickness from a\r\nfew lines or inches to several feet. In a few cases beds have been found\r\nmeasuring fifty or sixty feet in thickness. The workable beds are\r\nordinarily from three to six feet thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous formation is very much disturbed by dikes, faults\r\n(Fig. 18; see also Fig. 50), and other dislocations. The amount of\r\nchange of position in the strata, by faults, is very various; frequently\r\nbut a few feet. In one case in England there is a fault of nearly a\r\nthousand feet. There is a case of dislocation in Belgium where the\r\nstrata are bent into the form of the letter Z, so that a perpendicular\r\nshaft would cut through the same bed of coal several times.\r\n\r\nThe characters and order of superposition which have now been given may\r\nbe regarded as the general type of the carboniferous formation. There\r\nare, however, several important modifications. 1. Beds of coal sometimes\r\nalternate with beds of millstone grit. Thus, in Scotland and in the\r\nnorth of England, this intermediate member of the system disappears, or,\r\nrather, is incorporated with the coal measures. The same is true, to\r\nconsiderable extent, in this country. 2. Sometimes the carboniferous\r\nlimestone also disappears as a distinct member of the system, partly by\r\nbecoming arenaceous, and partly by the intercalation of beds of coal. In\r\nthis last case, the whole formation from the old to the new red\r\nsandstone becomes a series of coal measures. In this country the\r\ncarboniferous limestone is found very generally to underlie the coal\r\nstrata. 3. The fractures and faults, which were formerly supposed to be\r\ncharacteristic of the coal formation, are seldom found in the great\r\ncoal-fields of this country, except in those of the anthracite coal of\r\nPennsylvania; and even there they are much less common than in the\r\ncoal-fields of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal varieties of coal, distinguished by the\r\ndifferent proportions of bitumen which they contain. The common\r\nbituminous coal kindles readily, emits much smoke, and throws out so\r\nmuch liquid bitumen that the whole soon cakes into a solid mass. It\r\ncontains about forty per cent, of bitumen. The second kind, or cannel\r\ncoal, contains twenty per cent., and inflames easily, but does not\r\nagglutinate. The stone-coal, or anthracite, contains scarcely any\r\nbitumen, ignites with difficulty, emits but little smoke, and produces a\r\nvery intense heat. The bituminous varieties are always found in the\r\nleast disturbed portions of the coal districts; and the anthracite is\r\nfound in the more broken and convulsed portions, where we may suppose\r\nthat the subterranean heat has been sufficient to drive off the volatile\r\nbituminous part, and reduce it to the anthracite form. Hence the eastern\r\nPennsylvania coal-fields, which lie near the principal axes of elevation\r\nof the Appalachian Mountains, furnish only anthracite; while the same\r\ncoal-seams, in their extension to the western part of the state, are\r\nbituminous.\r\n\r\nWhere coal is quarried in large quantity, a shaft is sunk through the\r\noverlying strata to the coal-beds, and the coal is raised to 'the\r\nsurface by steam power. After the coal has been quarried to some\r\ndistance from the shaft, pillars of unquarried coal are left to support\r\nthe overlying strata. Fatal accidents have sometimes occurred by the\r\ngiving away of these supports. Over a large part of the coal-fields of\r\nthe United States it has not yet become necessary to sink shafts. The\r\nquarrying is commenced at the outcrop of the coal-bed; and, till the\r\ncover becomes of considerable thickness, it has been found economical to\r\n\"strip\" off the overlying rock, rather than to work a subterranean\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nBrine-springs are often found in the coal measures of sufficient\r\nstrength to be used in the manufacture of salt. This is now done to\r\nconsiderable extent in Ohio. In the valley of the Kenhawa river,\r\nKentucky, the rocks of which belong to the carboniferous system, the\r\nbrine is nearly saturated with salt; and in some of the borings they\r\nhave even discovered beds of rock-salt of great thickness and purity.\r\n\r\nThere is no other part of the geological series so obviously connected\r\nwith national prosperity as the coal formation. While a country is new,\r\nthe forests furnish an abundant supply of fuel; but in the course of a\r\nfew years these are consumed. This country will soon be principally\r\ndependent upon its coal-mines for fuel, even for domestic purposes; and,\r\nin carrying on the great branches of national industry, such as the\r\nsmelting and working of iron, and in the formation of steam for the\r\npurposes of manufacture and transportation, we are already mainly\r\ndependent upon mineral coal. A nation which does not possess an abundant\r\nsupply of this mineral, _or which does not use it_, cannot long maintain\r\na high degree of national prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn these inexhaustible masses of coal, accumulated ages before the\r\nexistence of the human race, is a most obvious prospective arrangement\r\nfor securing our happiness and improvement. And this arrangement\r\nembraces not only the accumulation of a combustible material in such\r\nabundance, but also its juxtaposition with an equally inexhaustible\r\naccumulation of iron ore, and the limestone which is necessary as a flux\r\nin the reduction of the ore. So bulky and heavy materials as coal and\r\niron ore could neither of them have been transported to any\r\nconsiderable distance for the manufacture of iron; and without the\r\nmanufacture of iron on a large scale, the present operations in\r\nmanufactures and transportation could never have been entered upon. A\r\nlarge proportion of the iron furnaces in this country, and nearly all of\r\nthem in Great Britain, employ mineral coal for fuel, and obtain their\r\nore from the beds contained in the coal measures.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the coal measures are almost entirely of vegetable\r\norigin, and are very abundant. They are seldom found in the coal-beds,\r\nbut in the strata of shale immediately above or below the solid coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe _Stigmaria_ (Fig. 19) is found most abundantly, and in a large\r\nproportion of cases to the exclusion of every other form, in the lower\r\nshales. It consisted of a large dome-shaped mass, often three or four\r\nfeet in diameter, with trailing branches, or roots, spreading off\r\nhorizontally to a distance of twenty feet. In a few instances tree ferns\r\nhave been found, petrified in a horizontal position, and being\r\napparently a mere continuation of the stigmaria. Hence the stigmaria has\r\nbeen supposed to be the base of the tall tree ferns, the leaves of which\r\nso abound in the upper shales. If this is not the case, there are no\r\nforms of the existing flora of the earth analogous to the stigmaria. It\r\nis always found in connection with the coal-beds of the carboniferous\r\nformation, and never with the coal-beds which sometimes occur in the\r\nlater formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe tree ferns (Fig. 20) attained a height of fifty or sixty feet, and a\r\ndiameter of four feet. They have received the name of _Sigillaria_ in\r\nconsequence of the seal-like impressions (Fig. 21) with which the\r\nsurface is covered, and which are the scars left where the fronds have\r\nfallen off. These fronds (fern leaves) are the most abundant fossil of\r\nthe series. They are distinguished by some peculiarity in form, as the\r\nSphenopteris (wedge-shaped fern leaf), Pachypteris (thick fern leaf),\r\n&c. (Figs. 22 and 23.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nThere was another kind of Sigillaria (Fig. 24), in which the surface was\r\nfluted, and the markings are superficial, and occur on the ridges. It\r\nreached as great a size as the tree ferns, but to what general class of\r\nplants it belonged is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidodendron_ (scale-covered tree) (Fig. 25) is the fossil which\r\nmost nearly resembled in general appearance our present forest trees.\r\nSpecimens are found four feet in diameter and seventy feet in height. In\r\nbotanical characters it resembled, in some respects, the trailing\r\nclub-mosses, while in others it was very similar to the Norfolk Island\r\npine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe _Calamite_ (Fig. 26) was a plant resembling, in its jointed and\r\nstriated surface, the equisetum (rush), but was sometimes twelve inches\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous formation exists more or less abundantly in all the\r\ngreat divisions of the earth. It occurs in nearly all of the countries\r\nof Europe. The largest deposits known are, however, in the United\r\nStates; especially in the States of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and in\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n4. _The New Red Sandstone._--The lower division of this formation,\r\ncalled the Permian system, consists of a thick mass of sandstones,\r\ngenerally of a red color, with occasional alternations of argillaceous\r\nrock, succeeded by a series of magnesian limestones. The upper division,\r\nor Triassic system, is composed of a red conglomerate, a limestone which\r\nhas received the name of Muschelkalk (shelly limestone), and a series of\r\nvariegated marls and sandstones.\r\n\r\nThe ores of copper are found, to considerable extent, in this formation.\r\nThe rich copper mines of Germany are in the magnesian limestone, or, as\r\nit is there called, Zechstein (minestone). The Lake Superior copper\r\nmines occur in a red sandstone formation, which will probably be found\r\nto belong to this system.\r\n\r\nThe salt-beds, salt springs, and beds of gypsum, are so, generally found\r\nin this rock in England, that it has been called by the English\r\ngeologists the \"saliferous system.\" It is, however, found that in other\r\ncountries these minerals occur in equal abundance in formations of an\r\nearlier and later date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils of this system are not abundant. In the Permian portion,\r\nimpressions of fishes are found, always with the peculiarity that the\r\ntail is _heterocercal_ (Fig. 27); that is, with the spine continued into\r\nthe upper lobe. The same peculiarity prevails in the carboniferous and\r\nall the earlier formations. Fishes with the tail _homocercal_ begin to\r\nappear in the Triassic portion of this system, and are found in all the\r\nsubsequent formations. The remains of saurians also occur in this\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe red sandstones seem to have been better adapted to retain the forms\r\nwhich were impressed upon them than to preserve the organic remains\r\nwhich were deposited in them. Hence, while they contain but few fossils,\r\nthe strata are often covered with ripple marks, with sun cracks,\r\noccasioned by contraction while drying, or with depressions produced by\r\nrain-drops, and the pits are sometimes so perfect as to show the\r\ndirection of the wind when the drops fell. (Fig. 28.) The tracks of\r\nanimals are also well preserved. Some of them were produced by reptiles\r\n(Fig. 29, _c_), and some probably by marsupial animals, but most of them\r\nby birds (_a_, _b_). President Hitchcock has distinguished the tracks of\r\nmore than thirty species in the sandstones of the Connecticut valley.\r\nBirds, reptiles and marsupial animals, seem to have been first\r\nintroduced during this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe new red sandstone is well developed in all its members on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. In England, all the members are present, except the\r\nMuschelkalk. The Triassic portion of it occurs in North America. It is\r\nfound in detached portions, probably as parts of a continuous formation,\r\nin Nova Scotia, the eastern part of Maine, the Connecticut valley, and\r\nfrom New Jersey southward through Pennsylvania, Maryland, &c., to South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n5. _The Oölitic System._--The lower portion of this system is the Lias,\r\nand consists of a series of fissile, argillaceous limestone, marl, and\r\nclays. The _Oölite_ forms the intermediate member of the system, and\r\nconsists of alternations of clay, arenaceous rock and limestone. Some of\r\nthe limestones have an oölitic structure, and the whole system takes its\r\nname from this circumstance, though this structure is not found in all\r\nparts of it, and is often found in other formations. The central part of\r\nthe oölite, the coral rag, is principally a mass of corals and\r\ncomminuted shells. The _Wealden_, the highest member of the oölitic\r\nsystem, is an estuary deposit, consisting of calcareous beds, followed\r\nby sandstone, and terminated by the Wealden clay.\r\n\r\nThis system is throughout highly calcareous, and furnishes, wherever it\r\nis developed, valuable materials for architectural and ornamental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThis system is distinguished for the great amount and variety of its\r\norganic remains. The _vegetable productions_ were intermediate between\r\nthose of the coal period and those of the present time. The upper\r\noölite, in the south of England, contains the stumps of trees and other\r\nplants, rooted in a black carbonaceous layer, evidently the soil from\r\nwhich they grew. These stumps and prostrate trunks are the remains of\r\nconiferous trees of large growth. (Fig. 30.)\r\n\r\nCorals occur in great abundance; also encrinites (Fig. 31), mollusks\r\n(Fig. 32), and cephalopoda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nBut this system is specially characterized by the remains of saurian\r\nreptiles. The Ichthyosaurus (Fig. 33, _a_) was a marine animal, having\r\nthe general form of a fish, while its head, and especially its teeth,\r\nresemble those of the crocodile. It was an air-breathing animal like\r\nthe cetacea, and was furnished with similar paddles. It was carnivorous,\r\nand was undoubtedly the largest and most formidable animal existing in\r\nthe earlier part of the oölitic period. Its length could not have been\r\nless than thirty or forty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nThe _Plesiosaurus_ (Fig. 33, _b_) was also a marine animal, and in ninny\r\nrespects similar to the Ichthyosaurus; but its general form was more\r\nslender, its head was small, and its neck was of great length, the\r\ncervical vertebræ exceeding in number those of the swan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pterodactyle_ (Fig. 34) was a small saurian, of the size, probably,\r\nof our largest eagle. The finger-bones, which in the other saurians form\r\nthe paddles, are in the Pterodactyle very much lengthened, so as to\r\nsupport a membranous expansion, like that of the bat. These wings were\r\nof sufficient size to enable it to sustain itself in the air, and to\r\nmake a rapid and easy flight.\r\n\r\nThe _Iguanodon_ is a Wealden fossil, remarkable for its great magnitude.\r\nIt is estimated that its length was seventy feet. It was a lizard,\r\nadapted for motion on land, and was herbivorous.\r\n\r\nThis formation is well developed in England, and, with the exception of\r\nthe Wealden, on the continent of Europe. It has been supposed that no\r\npart of the oölitic series was to be found in this country; but there is\r\na highly arenaceous rock occupying the valley of the James river, in the\r\nvicinity of Richmond, Virginia, of considerable extent, and a thousand\r\nfeet in thickness, containing a bed of coal of forty feet in thickness,\r\nwhich, from its fossils, must be referred to the oölitic series.\r\n\r\n6. _The Cretaceous Formation._--The lower part of this formation\r\nconsists of _greensand_, interstratified with beds of clay. The\r\nintermediate portion is a mixture of argillaceous greensand and _impure\r\nchalk_. The upper part is composed of _chalk_, which is a friable,\r\nnearly pure carbonate of lime. The strata of chalk are separated, at\r\nintervals of from three to six feet, by layers of flint, either in the\r\nform of nodules or of continuous strata.\r\n\r\nThese characters, by which the cretaceous system is known in England,\r\nare but partially recognized elsewhere. Thus, in the Alps, the\r\n\"Neocomian System,\" consisting of crystalline limestones, is the\r\nequivalent of the English greensand; while the greensand of this country\r\nis the equivalent of the white chalk of England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the cretaceous formation are very different from those of\r\nthe oölite, and are such as to show that it was deposited in deep seas.\r\n_Microscopic shells_ are often so abundant as to constitute a large\r\nproportion of the mass. _Zoöphytes_ are very numerous, such as sponges,\r\ncorals, star-fishes (Fig. 35, _d e_), and a few crinoidea (_b_).\r\nMollusks were also abundant, and cephalopoda, consisting of\r\nchamber-shells and belemnites (Fig. 36). The belemnite probably\r\nresembled the existing cuttle-fish; but the remains consist, in most\r\ncases, of a partially hollow calcareous substance (_b_), which was\r\ncontained within the animal, and formed its skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe chalk and greensand are largely developed in England; and the same\r\nformation, with different lithological characters, is found in great\r\nforce flanking the principal mountain ranges of southern Europe, and\r\nextending into Asia. In this country the system commences with the\r\ngreensand and friable limestones of New Jersey, and following the\r\nAlleghany range to its southern termination, it bends around into a\r\nnorth-western direction, and is continued into Missouri.\r\n\r\n7. _The Tertiary System._--The tertiary strata embrace the formations\r\nfrom the cretaceous to the human era. They consist of clay, sand,\r\nsandstone, marl and limestone, and are distinguished from the lower\r\nrocks by being less consolidated; though the limestones are in some\r\ninstances solidified, and resemble the strata of earlier origin. The\r\ntertiary strata are generally of less thickness than the older\r\nformations, and less continuous, being local deposits formed in lakes\r\nand estuaries. In a few instances they have been thrown into inclined\r\npositions, though in most cases they have been but slightly disturbed,\r\nand raised but a few hundred feet above the present level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe late tertiary strata seldom overlap the older, so as to indicate\r\ntheir relative ages by superposition. They have therefore been separated\r\ninto groups according to the proportions of living and extinct species\r\nof shells which they are found to contain. The oldest tertiary or\r\n_Eocene formation_[A] contains only four per cent, of living species,\r\nthe _Miocene_ contains seventeen per cent., the Pleiocene forty per\r\ncent., and the _Pleistocene_ ninety per cent.\r\n\r\n [A] _Eös_, dawn, and _kainos_, recent. The formation\r\n     which commenced at _the dawn of the recent period_,\r\n     containing but a small number of living species.\r\n     Miocene (_meion_, less), less recent than the Pleiocene\r\n     (_pleion_, more). Pleistocene (_pleistos_, most), most\r\n     recent.\r\n\r\nDuring the pleistocene period, peculiar conditions existed, by which a\r\ngreat amount of loose material, known by the name of _drift_, was spread\r\nover the northern portions of both hemispheres. In America it is found\r\nfrom Nova Scotia nearly to the Rocky Mountains, and extending as far\r\nsouth as Pennsylvania and the Ohio river. In Europe, it is found from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, and reaching south into Germany and\r\nPoland. It is also found in the colder portions of South America, and in\r\nthe vicinity of several mountains, as the Alps.\r\n\r\nIt consists of irregular accumulations of earthy substances of different\r\ndegrees of fineness, but characterized by containing masses of rock of\r\nconsiderable size, often of many tons weight, called boulders. Rocks\r\nhaving the same lithological characters exist in situ north of where the\r\nboulders and other drift are now found, though at a distance often of\r\none or two hundred miles. There can be no doubt but that the drift has\r\nbeen transported from these northern localities; and the polished,\r\nstriated and grooved condition of the rocky surface, wherever the drift\r\nis distributed, has obviously been produced by the passage of the drift\r\nmaterials over it.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this period, while the land was a few hundred feet\r\nbelow its present level, there were deposited in the valleys of the\r\ndrift region beds of blue and gray clay, materials which are used in\r\nmaking bricks and coarse pottery; also beds of sand, sometimes evenly\r\nspread out, but often thrown into irregular mounds and ridges.\r\n\r\nIn regions which are not covered with drift,--as the south of Europe and\r\nthe United States,--the pleistocene deposits are succeeded, without\r\napparent change of conditions, by those which are now taking place.\r\n\r\nThe formations of the tertiary period are distinguished from those of\r\nthe cretaceous period by the absence of deep-sea fossils, and from the\r\noölite by the absence of its characteristic saurians. The mollusks are\r\nalso very different, such genera as the cerethium (Fig. 37), murex (Fig.\r\n38), and conus (Fig. 39), which abound in the present seas, first\r\nappearing in the tertiary period. The nummulite (Fig. 40), a peculiar\r\nform of chambered shell, is so abundant as to constitute in some places\r\nalmost the entire rock.\r\n\r\nThe period is however characterized by the existence of a large number\r\nof pachydermatous animals, of which the tapir, hog, horse and elephant,\r\nare examples of living species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe _Paleotherium_ (Fig. 41) resembled, in most respects, the tapir. It\r\nwas furnished with a short proboscis, and the foot was divided into\r\nthree toes. The length of the largest species was about that of the\r\nhorse; but its body was larger, and it was of less height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe _Anoplotherium_ (Fig. 42) was a more slender animal, and resembled\r\nin size and general form the gazelle.\r\n\r\nThe _Megatherium_, an animal of the late tertiary epoch, was larger than\r\nthe existing species of elephant, and in its general structure and\r\nhabits resembled the sloth.\r\n\r\nThe _Mastodon_ (Fig. 43) lived during the latest portion of the tertiary\r\nepoch. Its remains are found most abundantly where the animal seems to\r\nhave perished by sinking into the soft marshy ground near the brackish\r\nsprings of New York and Kentucky. But they are found also in Europe and\r\nAsia. It was larger than any existing land animal, and was nearly allied\r\nin structure and habits to the elephant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mammoth_ was a species of elephant, now extinct, of which remains\r\nare found with those of the mastodon, but in the greatest abundance in\r\nEurope and Asia. A large number of skeletons, many of them imperfect,\r\nhave been discovered in the low grounds in the south-east of England. It\r\nwas this animal which was found encased in ice and sand in Siberia, in\r\n1804.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the existence of these huge animals, a near\r\napproach was made to the present fauna of the earth, by the introduction\r\nof ruminant animals resembling the ox and deer, and especially by the\r\nexistence of the class of animals which in anatomical characters stands\r\nnext to man, the apes and monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary system, though not generally so continuous over extended\r\nareas as the older formations, yet constitutes the surface of a very\r\nlarge part of Europe. (See Fig. 59.) In the United States the earlier\r\nportion is found along the seaboard, from New Jersey to Louisiana, and\r\nextending back towards the mountains to a distance varying from ten to\r\none hundred miles. The later deposits are found in detached portions\r\nthroughout the Eastern and Middle States. It covers a large surface in\r\nSouth America, and is found in India.\r\n\r\n8. _The Recent Formation._--It is intended to embrace in this term\r\nstrata which have been formed since the creation of man. It is, however,\r\nimpossible to separate them by any well-defined characters from those of\r\nthe tertiary period. The recent formation consists of land which is\r\nforming by the filling up of lakes, and by the increase of deltas from\r\nthe accumulated sediment which rivers have furnished.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no doubt but that formations on a large scale have\r\ncontinued in progress over extensive areas of the bed of the sea; and\r\nthey have been no less rapid, we may presume, than they were in earlier\r\nperiods. But, though they are preserving the records of the present era,\r\nthey will probably remain in a great measure inaccessible for many ages.\r\n\r\nThese deposits, so far as they are accessible, are found to contain the\r\nremains of plants and animals (including man) now living in the vicinity\r\nwhere the deposits are forming.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--FOSSILS.\r\n\r\nAny organic substance imbedded in a geological formation, or any product\r\nof organic life, as a coprolite or a coin, or any marking which an\r\norganic substance has given to a rock, is regarded as a _fossil_. The\r\nstudy of fossils, as a branch of practical geology, requires an\r\nacquaintance with the principles and the minute details of botany and\r\nzoology. Without this knowledge, however, many of the general\r\nconclusions to which the study of fossils has led may be understood.\r\n\r\n1. _Fossils are preserved in different ways._--When any organic\r\nsubstance is imbedded in a forming rock, it may itself remain; or it may\r\nbe removed by the infiltration of water, or other causes, so gradually\r\nas to leave its form, and even its most delicate markings, in the rock;\r\nor some mineral substance may have been substituted, and fill the space\r\nwhich the organic substance once occupied; that is, it may be an organic\r\nsubstance preserved, it may be an impression of it, or it may be a cast\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n2. The process by which the substitution in this last case is effected\r\nis called _mineralization_. The mineralizing ingredient is generally\r\nderived from the contiguous rock. In siliceous rocks it is silex. In\r\ncalcareous rocks it is carbonate of lime. When iron is diffused through\r\na rock, it often becomes the mineralizer. The substituted mineral is\r\ngenerally a very perfect representation of the original fossil. We\r\ncannot therefore suppose that the original substance was entirely\r\nremoved before any of the mineral matter was deposited. The substitution\r\nmust have taken place particle by particle, as the organic matter was\r\nremoved. Fossils are, in fact, often found, in which the mineralization\r\nhas been arrested after it had commenced, so that the fossil is in part\r\nan organic and in part a mineral substance. It has been proved, by\r\ndirect experiment, that these changes of removal and substitution are\r\nsimultaneous. Pieces of wood were placed in a solution of sulphate of\r\niron. After a few days, the wood was found to be partially mineralized,\r\nand after the remaining ligneous matter had been removed by exposing it\r\nto a red heat, \"oxide of iron was found to have taken the form of the\r\nwood so exactly, that even the dotted vessels, peculiar to the species\r\nemployed, were distinctly visible under the microscope.\"\r\n\r\n3. As the fossiliferous strata are generally of marine origin, it is to\r\nbe presumed that only a small proportion of terrestrial animals are\r\npreserved; and our knowledge of the organic remains which are preserved\r\nis yet so imperfect, that discoveries are constantly making, as\r\nexaminations are extended. Still, enough is known to enable us to draw\r\nsome satisfactory conclusions as to _the order in which living beings\r\nwere created upon the earth_.\r\n\r\nThough most of the earlier organic forms which have been preserved are\r\nof animal origin, yet vegetable remains occasionally occur in connection\r\nwith them, and we must suppose vegetables to have been produced\r\nabundantly. For all animal food consists of vegetable substances, or of\r\nanimal substances which have once existed in the vegetable form. No\r\nanimal is capable of effecting those combinations of inorganic matter\r\nupon which its growth and sustenance depend. We may therefore conclude\r\nthat _the introduction of animals and vegetables was contemporaneous_.\r\n\r\nThe greatest development of vegetable life was, however, during the\r\ncarboniferous period. The design of this abundant growth was\r\nprospective. It was not produced for the support of animal life, but for\r\nfuel, and stored till man should be introduced, and so far advanced in\r\ncivilization as to make this supply of carbonaceous matter subservient\r\nto his wants and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods, the lower forms of animal life were, beyond all\r\ncomparison, the most abundant; yet the four great divisions of the\r\nanimal kingdom, Radiated, Articulated, Molluscous, and Vertebrated\r\nanimals, were all represented. There is, however, no evidence that any\r\nvertebrated animals, except fishes, were created till after the\r\ncarboniferous period. In the next formation, the new red sandstone, we\r\nfind the tracks of reptiles and birds, and probably of marsupial\r\nanimals. The first evidence of the existence of mammalia in great\r\nnumbers is in the tertiary period, when the pachydermata and edentata\r\nwere so much more abundant than they have ever been since, and when the\r\nbimana first appear.\r\n\r\nBut there is no evidence from geology that man existed till after the\r\nclose of the tertiary period. The grounds upon which contrary statements\r\nhave sometimes been made are untenable. In Ohio a very perfect\r\nimpression of a human foot was found on a slab of limestone of the\r\nsilurian age. But it was subsequently ascertained to have been common\r\nfor the aborigines, in the vicinity of their encampments, to cut in the\r\nrocks, with surprising accuracy, the forms of the tracks of man and\r\nother animals.\r\n\r\nThere is a human skeleton in the British Museum imbedded in solid\r\nlimestone, and another in Paris, both taken from Guadaloupe. It was at\r\none time supposed, from the degree of solidification of the limestone,\r\nthat it must have been formed at an early geological period; but it is\r\nfound that the beach-sand of that island now solidifies rapidly, from\r\nthe carbonate of lime which the waters there hold in solution. It is\r\nrendered probable that the skeletons found there have not been buried\r\nmore than a century and a half.\r\n\r\n4. As many parts of the bed of the present seas, which are probably\r\nreceiving detrital matter constantly, are unfavorable for the\r\ndevelopment of animal life, while other parts are highly favorable, it\r\nmight be presumed that animal life would be equally scanty in particular\r\nlocalities while the earlier rocks were forming, and in other localities\r\nvery abundant. Hence some strata, for hundreds of feet in thickness, are\r\ncomposed almost entirely of fossils, while other strata are nearly or\r\nquite destitute of them. The same member of a formation may in one place\r\nbe full of fossils, and in another without them. _The distribution of\r\nfossils_ is therefore subject to no general law; at least, none of which\r\nwe can avail ourselves, in the search for them.\r\n\r\n5. The value of fossils in geology consists in the use which is made of\r\nthem in determining _the origin and age of strata_.\r\n\r\nAs the animal species which inhabit bodies of fresh water are always\r\ndifferent from those found in the sea, their remains constitute the best\r\nmeans of determining whether a formation is of _fresh water_ or _marine\r\norigin_. In order to decide this point, it may, in some cases, be\r\nnecessary to be acquainted with the habits of particular species. In\r\nmost cases, however, it will be sufficient to remember that in\r\nfresh-water formations, first, there are no sponges, corals, or\r\nchambered shells; second, the univalves all have entire mouths (Fig.\r\n44). Third, the bivalves are all bimuscular (Fig. 47). If, therefore, a\r\nformation is found to contain sponge, coral, a chambered shell, a\r\nunivalve with a deeply notched mouth (Fig. 45), or a unimuscular bivalve\r\n(Fig. 46), it must be considered a marine formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the same formation, as exhibited in different places,\r\ndiffers in its thickness, composition and degree of solidification. If\r\nwe could trace the strata through all the intermediate space, we might\r\nbe certain of their being the same formation, notwithstanding the change\r\nin lithological characters. But this can seldom be done, even for a few\r\nmiles in extent. Sections of the strata are obtained only occasionally,\r\nwhere rivers have cut through them, or where, over limited areas, the\r\nsoil has been removed from the outcropping edges. It is also frequently\r\nthe case that the strata are so much disturbed that their position will\r\nfurnish no aid in determining their age. When folded axes occur (as here\r\nrepresented), the older strata are often the uppermost. There is an\r\ninstance in the Alps in which strata of vast thickness have been\r\ninverted during the process of upheaval, and now rest on a bed of rock\r\nformed from the debris which they had supplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is important to determine what formations are of the same\r\nage, notwithstanding their displacements, difference in lithological\r\ncharacters, and separation by great distances and by mountains or\r\noceans. This determination can be made only by a comparison of the\r\nimbedded fossils. It is found that every formation, and every important\r\nmember of a formation, contains an assemblage of fossils peculiar to\r\nitself. When very widely separated, the species of fossils may not be\r\nidentical, but so very similar that they are regarded as equivalent\r\nspecies. _The identification of formations_ consists in the\r\nidentification of fossils. It is for this purpose mainly that fossils\r\nare regarded as of so great importance.\r\n\r\n6. If each formation is characterized by the presence of new species, it\r\nfollows that _the work of creation was a progressive one_, continued\r\nthrough long periods of time. The latest creation of which we have any\r\ngeological evidence is that of man. And if the leading design of the\r\nexistence of this earth was as a theatre for the development of moral\r\ncharacter, it is to be presumed that the work of creation ceased when a\r\nspecies possessing moral capacities had been introduced.\r\n\r\nIt follows also, from what has been said, that there has been a constant\r\ndisappearance, a death, of species. It would seem that each species has\r\na life assigned to it, which is to be completed and surrendered. Though\r\nits continuance is many times longer than the life of any individual of\r\nthe species, yet _it is the course of nature that species should\r\ndisappear_.\r\n\r\nThere may be something in the constitution of each species by which its\r\ncontinuance is limited, making an old age and death necessary, as it is\r\nin individuals. But there are other causes by which the duration of\r\nspecies may often be terminated. The subsidence of New Holland would\r\ncause the destruction of a large number of species. The preservation of\r\nthe human species was at one time effected only by a special and\r\nmiraculous interference. Slowly operating causes are now at work, by\r\nwhich many species, such as the elephant, wolf and tiger, will at length\r\nbecome extinct. Their existence in a natural state cannot long be\r\ncontinued in a civilized country. The forest, their natural abode,\r\ndisappears, and some are intentionally destroyed, because they render\r\nlife and property unsafe. Under the operation of these causes, the Irish\r\nelk (cervus giganteus) has become extinct, probably within the human\r\nera. The Dodo, a gallinaceous bird, found living when maritime\r\ncommunication between Europe and the East Indies was first established,\r\nis now extinct. The Apteryx, a bird belonging to New Zealand, has\r\nprobably become extinct since the commencement of the present century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--THE TIME NECESSARY FOR THE FORMATION OF THE STRATIFIED\r\nROCKS.\r\n\r\nThere are no means of which the geologist can avail himself to determine\r\nthe antiquity of the earth, or the amount of time since the sedimentary\r\ndeposits commenced. But a nigh degree of antiquity may yet be shown.\r\n\r\nThe materials for all the stratified rocks have been obtained by the\r\ndestruction of previously solidified igneous rocks. This destruction may\r\nhave been accomplished in part by the operation of volcanic forces, but\r\nmuch of it is the result of slow disintegration, and of the eroding\r\npower of running water; and we can scarcely conceive of a period\r\nsufficiently protracted for such results.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion of the high antiquity of the earth is confirmed by\r\nobserving that the stratified rocks consist of layers often not thicker\r\nthan sheets of paper, and probably not averaging the tenth of an inch;\r\nand yet each layer is separate from the rest, in consequence of some\r\nchange in the conditions under which it was deposited. Each layer was\r\nprobably produced by the deposition of all the sediment furnished at one\r\ntime, and hence only as many layers would be formed in a year as the\r\nnumber of freshets in the rivers which furnished the materials. If we\r\nconsider the fossiliferous and metamorphic rocks to be each forty\r\nthousand feet in thickness,--which is not too large an estimate,--we\r\nmust reckon the years by hundreds of thousands to make the time\r\nsufficiently extended for the result.\r\n\r\nAll the formations of any considerable extent now above the surface of\r\nthe sea existed before the creation of man, for none of them contain any\r\nevidence of the existence of human beings; and if they had existed while\r\nthese strata were forming, sufficient evidence would have been left of\r\nthe fact, either in the form of fossilized human bones, or of works of\r\nhuman art. Hence, whatever be the estimate which we form of the\r\nantiquity of the earth, from the slowness of denudation, or from the\r\nthickness of the strata, we must now add to that estimate the period\r\nelapsed since the creation of the human species.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at different periods of the earth's history different\r\nspecies of animals inhabited it. We are unable to fix with accuracy the\r\nordinary duration of species. But the species which are now extinct\r\nprobably had an existence as long-continued as will be enjoyed by\r\nspecies now living. Many recent species are known to have existed at\r\nleast nearly six thousand years, without, in most cases, any indications\r\nof their soon becoming extinct. Whatever period be assigned as the\r\nordinary duration of species, that period has been several times\r\nrepeated; for the earth has been several times re-peopled, and every\r\ntime by species which had not before existed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the _amount_ of organic matter in the strata must have\r\nrequired long periods of time for its accumulation. The vegetable\r\ndeposits, now converted into coal, are generally several feet thick, and\r\noften over a hundred feet, and are known to extend over several thousand\r\nsquare miles, both in this country and in Europe. Many of the\r\nsedimentary rocks consist almost entirely of animal remains. The\r\nmountain limestone, for instance, is eight hundred feet or more in\r\nthickness, and in some places consists of the exuviæ of encrinites and\r\ntestacea.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the length of time required is shown, not from the amount\r\nof organic remains, but from the evidence that they were deposited very\r\nslowly. The polishing stone called tripoli is found in beds of ten or\r\ntwelve feet in thickness, and is composed entirely of the siliceous\r\nshells of animalcules, so minute that, according to the estimate of\r\nEhrenberg, the number in a cubic inch is forty-one billions. Several\r\nother rocks, such as semi-opal and flint, are sometimes found to have a\r\nsimilar constitution. The time necessary for the accumulation of beds\r\nseveral feet thick by the shells of animalcules so minute must have been\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nEach of these facts carries us back to a period immeasurably anterior to\r\nthe creation of man, as the epoch when the sedimentary deposits\r\ncommenced. There are no facts in geology which point to a different\r\nconclusion. It is of the utmost importance to the geological student to\r\nfamiliarize himself with this principle. It will assist him in\r\ncomprehending the greatness of geological changes, and in applying other\r\nprinciples in explanation of geological phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis principle, so obvious to any one who allows himself to reason from\r\nthe facts which geology presents, has sometimes been regarded as at\r\nvariance with the Mosaic account of the creation. And if this account\r\nreally assigns an antiquity to the earth of not more than six thousand\r\nyears, the difficulty exists.\r\n\r\nThe statements made by Moses are found, upon examination, to be of the\r\nmost general character. They assert, in the first place, simply that \"In\r\nthe beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\" The time which\r\nelapsed after this first act, and previously to the acts of creation\r\nsubsequently recorded, is not limited by the sacred narrative. It may\r\nhave been during this indefinite lapse of time that God gave existence\r\nand enjoyment to a large number of animal species on the surface of the\r\nearth, and at the same time effected most of those physical changes in\r\nthe crust of it which have rendered it a fit abode for intellectual and\r\nmoral beings.\r\n\r\nBut if the word _day_, in the first chapter of Genesis, be considered to\r\nmean a prolonged period (and philologists regard such an interpretation\r\nas admissible), then that chapter is a record of the most important\r\nevents in the history of the earth up to and including the introduction\r\nof man. And the account, thus understood, coincides with the results of\r\ngeological examinations.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of discrepancy between the works and the word of God, we\r\nhave this remarkable fact, that a history of the earth, written long\r\nbefore the science of geology was known, is not contradicted, but\r\nconfirmed, by the progress of science thus far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHANGES TO WHICH THE CRUST OF THE EARTH HAS BEEN SUBJECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--CHANGES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE AT GREAT DEPTHS BELOW THE\r\nSURFACE.\r\n\r\nThe lowest change of winch we can gain any information is the _formation\r\nof granite_. It will be shown hereafter that it has been in a melted\r\nstate, and that it has taken its present form on cooling. But whether\r\nany considerable portions of the granitic masses, or of the melted\r\nmasses now below the surface, have resulted from the fusion of\r\nstratified rocks, we have not the means of determining. It is, however,\r\nnot improbable, that in the changes of level to which the crust of the\r\nearth has been subjected, the stratified rocks may have gone down so far\r\nas to become melted. At the same time, the melted rock which is thrown\r\nto the surface by volcanoes is subjected to the various destroying\r\nagencies by which it becomes sedimentary matter, to be deposited as\r\nmechanical strata. Thus, as the igneous rocks from below are brought up\r\nto furnish materials for mechanical strata, there must be an equal\r\namount of depression of the mechanical strata towards the seats of\r\nigneous action. And if this change takes place more rapidly than the\r\nthickness of crust increases, then portions of the sedimentary rocks\r\nmust be undergoing fusion.\r\n\r\nNext above the granite an immense thickness of rock occurs, which\r\nexhibits, from its stratification and from the water-worn fragments\r\nwhich it contains, distinct evidence of its mechanical origin. And yet\r\nit is very different from the later mechanical formations. It is more\r\nhighly crystalline; it has, to a great extent, assumed a cleavage\r\ndistinct from the planes of stratification, and chemical affinity has\r\nbeen so far active as to produce new combinations, and give to them\r\ntheir peculiar crystalline form, as in the case of garnets, iron\r\npyrites, &c. These strata also differ from those above them in\r\ncontaining no organic remains. It is not certain that organic life\r\nexisted on the earth at the time when these rocks were deposited. Either\r\nit did not, or the evidence of it in the strata of that period has been\r\nobliterated. The changes have at least been sufficient to justify their\r\nbeing characterized as _metamorphic rocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--CHANGES IN THE MASS OF THE STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n1. The stratified rocks were deposited as mud or sand, and were at first\r\nin a yielding state. Most of these deposits have become _solidified\r\nrock_, such as limestone, clay slate and sandstone. The chalk of England\r\nis, however, but imperfectly consolidated, the great sandstone formation\r\nof New Holland is a friable mass easily disintegrated, and occasionally\r\nbeds of clay in a plastic state are found as far down as the coal. Among\r\nthe later rocks the solidification is less general, though there is some\r\ndegree of hardening in all except the most superficial layers. The\r\n_fissile structure_ results from the solidification of the particles\r\ncomposing each layer separately.\r\n\r\n2. Since the solidification of the strata, or perhaps in connection with\r\nit, there has been something of movement among the particles, resulting\r\nin mineral veins, conchoidal structure, &c. One of the most general\r\nchanges of this kind is that by which a mass becomes separable into thin\r\nsheets, independent of the stratification, and not parallel with it.\r\nThis structure is represented by Fig. 48, in which the heavier lines are\r\nthose of stratification, and the lighter of _cleavage_.\r\n\r\n3. The strata have been everywhere more or less broken, and the\r\n_fractures_, nearly vertical, extend to groat depths. When a fracture\r\nreaches the surface, it often becomes a channel for water. It is thus\r\nwidened by the erosion, the deepest parts become filled with debris, and\r\nit becomes a _gorge_, _ravine_ or _valley_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\nIf the fracture does not come to the surface, it becomes a _cavern_. In\r\nlimestone, caverns which are formed in this way are very frequent, and\r\nextend for many miles. There is generally a stream of water running\r\nthrough them, but not of sufficient volume to have produced the erosion\r\nwhich has been effected.\r\n\r\nWhen the sides of the fracture are but little separated, some mineral\r\noften separates itself from the adjacent rock, and filling up the space,\r\nreunites the broken parts. It is then called a _vein of segregation_\r\n(Fig. 49, _a b_). But the fracture is more frequently filled with some\r\nvolcanic rock injected from below. It is then a _dike_ (_c_ _d_), and\r\nmay have a width of many rods, though it often diminishes in width till\r\nit is a mere thread. A dike of which the injected material is a metallic\r\nore is a _mineral vein_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\n4. The uplifting force by which the fracture is produced has frequently\r\nraised the rock on one side higher than it has on the other. This is\r\ncalled a _fault_. (Fig. 50.) The unequal movements by which the fault is\r\nproduced seem in some instances to have been repeated several times, and\r\nthe grinding of the broken edges upon each other has polished and\r\nstriated the sides of the fracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\n5. Sedimentary rocks are often found with the planes of their strata\r\nmore or less _inclined_. It is evident that they were not thus formed.\r\nThe depositions of sediment from water will always be horizontal, or, at\r\nmost, only slightly inclined. But there is often evidence in the rock\r\nitself that its strata were once horizontal. It is frequently observed\r\nthat vertical strata contain pebbles with their longer axes in the plane\r\nof the strata. (Fig. 51.) When these pebbles were deposited, the longer\r\naxes would take, on an obvious mechanical principle, a horizontal\r\nposition. Their present vertical position must have resulted from a\r\nchange in the position of the strata in which they are enclosed. The\r\nsame thing is shown by the position of a petrified forest in the south\r\nof England, known as the Portland dirt-bed. Some parts of it are\r\ninclined at an angle of forty-five degrees. The position of the\r\nvegetable remains (Fig. 52) shows that when they were growing the\r\nsurface was horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe line _b d_ (Fig. 53), on inclined strata which makes with the\r\nhorizon the greatest angle, is called the _direction of the dip_. The\r\nangle thus formed (_a b d_) is the _angle of inclination_. When inclined\r\nstrata come to the surface, the exposed edge, _b c_, is the _outcrop_,\r\nand the line of outcrop on a horizontal surface is called the _strike_\r\nof the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nWhen the inclined position is produced by an uplift of the strata, along\r\na given line, so that they dip in opposite directions, this line is\r\ncalled an _anticlinal axis_, as at Fig. 54. If, however, the strata are\r\nfractured along this line, as at _b_, the fracture becomes a _valley of\r\nelevation_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\nIf depression take place along a given line, as at _c_, the strata will\r\ndip towards this line, and it will be a _synclinal axis_. The depression\r\nwill be a _valley of subsidence_. A synclinal axis would also be\r\nproduced by an elevation of the strata, as at _d_ and _e_, on each side\r\nof it, and the valley thus produced is one of elevation.\r\n\r\nWhen successive sets of strata, as _f_ and _d_, Fig. 53, are not\r\nparallel, they are said to be _unconformable_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\n6. When the strata are subjected to displacement, they do not always\r\ntake a merely inclined position, but are often _contorted_ (Fig. 55), or\r\nfolded together (Fig. 56). These _folded axes_ frequently succeed each\r\nother for many miles. (See Figs. 7 and 82.) In the case represented by\r\nFig. 56, if the highest portion has been removed, so that the line _a b_\r\nrepresents the actual surface, we shall have apparently a succession of\r\ndeposits, of which those at _b_ would be the newest, and the oldest\r\nwould be found at _a_, when in fact the strata at the extremities are\r\nparts of the same layer.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that disturbances like those now mentioned have been\r\ntaking place continually, in different places, from the earliest times.\r\nThere have been no periods of universal disturbance, and none of\r\nuniversal repose. On the contrary, the periods of disturbance in one\r\npart of the world have been periods of repose in another. For example,\r\nthe coal measures of Europe were much broken and disturbed before the\r\ndeposition of the new red sandstone, and the close of the coal period\r\nwas at one time supposed to have been a period of general convulsion. It\r\nis now ascertained that the principal coal-fields in this country were\r\nnot much disturbed at that period, and have not been since.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--CHANGES OF ELEVATION AND SUBSIDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe continents, if we except the more rugged and broken portions, rise\r\nfrom the sea with an almost imperceptible ascent; and even the mountains\r\nhave a much gentler slope than we are apt to suppose, so that a section\r\nof the earth parallel to the equator would be almost a perfect circle.\r\nThe slope of a mountain, from its base to its highest point, rarely\r\nforms with the horizon an angle of as much as twelve degrees. In the\r\nfollowing figure (57), A represents the peak of Chimborazo, B of\r\nTeneriffe, C of Ætna, and D of Mount Loa, the principal volcano of the\r\nSandwich Islands. The highest mountains would be represented on a\r\ntwelve-inch globe by an altitude of less than the one-hundredth of an\r\ninch above the level of the sea. But the rising and sinking of these\r\nmasses, though so small compared with the dimensions of the earth, are\r\nyet geological changes on the largest scale.\r\n\r\n1. _The Elevation of Mountains._--Mountains have formerly been covered\r\nwith the waters of the ocean. This is evident, in the case of some\r\nmountains, from the existence of stratified rocks reaching to the\r\nsummits. The stratification could have been produced only by deposition\r\nfrom water. It is, moreover, evident from the existence of marine\r\nfossils, distributed through these strata, so abundantly, that they\r\ncannot be accounted for on any other hypothesis than that the animals\r\nlived and died where the remains of them are now found. These strata\r\nmust therefore have formed the bed of the sea while the fossils were\r\naccumulating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nThere is no _direct_ evidence that the granitic mountain peaks were ever\r\nsubmerged. But there is reason for believing that the sedimentary strata\r\nwhich now occupy the lower slopes were, at the time of their deposition,\r\ncontinuous,--the igneous rock having subsequently broken through\r\nthem,--so that the waters of the ocean once rested on the whole area\r\nwhich the mountain now occupies!\r\n\r\nIf the ocean could ever have been above its present level sufficiently\r\nto have covered all the sedimentary rocks, we might assume that the\r\nheight of mountains has not been changed. But the level of the ocean\r\ncannot be subject to much variation. The total amount of water on the\r\nglobe is always the same. If the continents and mountains were all\r\nsubmerged at once, and the waters were expanded by the highest\r\ntemperature consistent with the liquid form, there would not be a change\r\nof level of more than two hundred and fifty feet. We may assume, then,\r\nthat the ocean level has always been essentially the same that it now\r\nis. We must therefore conclude that the sedimentary rocks, and the\r\nmountains of which they form a part, have been elevated to their present\r\nposition from the bed of the sea.\r\n\r\nDifferent mountain ranges have been elevated at different periods. The\r\nsilurian and carboniferous formations were deposited before the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, which they contributed to form, were elevated;\r\nwhile the new red sandstone and the cretaceous and tertiary formations\r\nwere deposited subsequently to the upheaval. They are accordingly found\r\nat the base of the range, nearly horizontal, and have risen above the\r\nlevel of the ocean only as the continent generally has risen. The\r\nPyrenees were elevated after the deposition of the cretaceous rocks, and\r\nhave carried them up so that they appear at a high angle, while the\r\ntertiary rocks at the base are horizontal, as in the United States. The\r\nAndes have carried up the tertiary rocks with them, and their elevation\r\nmust therefore belong to a recent period. It appears that they are even\r\nyet rising.\r\n\r\nIt has recently been shown that the Alps have been subjected to upheaval\r\nat several distinct periods. At the close of the silurian period they\r\nformed a cluster of islands. At the commencement of the tertiary period\r\nthey became a mountain range, and at the close of that period they were\r\nthrown up some two thousand feet higher, to their present position.\r\nNearly the same things will probably be found true of other mountain\r\nranges, when their structure has been minutely studied.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of contiguous parallel ridges will necessarily leave\r\nintervening _valleys of elevation_. As mountain ranges generally consist\r\nof several such ridges, valleys of this description are numerous, and\r\nthey are often of great extent.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there are mountains in the sea of as great height\r\nabove the lowest valleys as the mountains of continents are above the\r\nlevel of the sea. If a new continent should hereafter be formed by the\r\nelevation of a large area of the bed of the sea, the existing mountains,\r\nnow appearing in the form of islands, would partake of the general\r\nmovement, and the new continent would have the same general diversities\r\nof surface as existing continents. The mountains would have existed long\r\nbefore the continent. It is therefore to be supposed that the mountains\r\nof the present continents were elevated before the continents, and that\r\nthey stood for long periods as islands, exposed to the action of waves,\r\ntides, and marine currents.\r\n\r\n2. _The Elevation of Continents._--Continents have been elevated by so\r\nslow a movement that it has not generally been perceived, even when they\r\nhave been peopled by nations advanced in civilization. And yet\r\nsatisfactory evidence is always left of former sea-levels.\r\n\r\nAlmost every seaboard furnishes examples of beaches, evidently once\r\nwashed by the sea, but now elevated more or less above high water.\r\n\r\nAt Lubec, near the northern extremity of the coast of Maine,\r\nbarnacles[B] are found attached to the rocks eighteen feet above high\r\nwater. The pilots at that place, and for a hundred miles north and south\r\nof it, speak of the ship-channels as diminishing in depth, though it is\r\ncertain that they are not filling up. Such facts are to be explained\r\nonly by supposing that the coast is rising.\r\n\r\n [B] The barnacle is a marine animal, permanently fixed\r\n     to the rocks, and live but a short time without being\r\n     surrounded by sea-water.\r\n\r\nLakes are numerous throughout the northern portions of North America,\r\nwhich are receiving annually large quantities of sediment, and must\r\nultimately become alluvial plains. Those of moderate depth, as Lake\r\nErie, cannot require periods very protracted to fill them. Their\r\ncontinuance in such abundance indicates that the elevation of the\r\ncontinent to its present height is comparatively recent. This conclusion\r\nis confirmed by evidence of another kind. Throughout this region of\r\nlakes, beds of clay containing the remains of existing species of marine\r\nanimals, are found at all elevations from the sea-coast, to the height\r\nof about four hundred feet, but not higher. These clay beds are very\r\nrecent, and were deposited when the surface was four hundred or five\r\nhundred feet lower than it now is; and this amount of elevation has left\r\nthe existing lakes scattered over the surface.[C]\r\n\r\n [C] \"It is remarkable that on the shores of the great\r\n     lakes there are certain plants the proper station of\r\n     which is the immediate neighborhood of the ocean, as if\r\n     they had constituted part of the early flora of those\r\n     regions when the lakes were filled with salt water, and\r\n     have survived the change that has taken place in the\r\n     physical conditions of their soil.\"--_Torrey's Flora of\r\n     the State of New York._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nThe following (Fig. 58) exhibits Europe as it was during the Silurian\r\nepoch, and Fig. 59 as it was at the commencement of the tertiary epoch.\r\nThe land, as it then existed, is represented by the white surface, the\r\npresent waters by the dark shading, and the land which has been\r\nreclaimed from the ocean by elevation since those periods by the lighter\r\nshading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\nThe whole southern part of South America, embracing an area equal to\r\nthat of Europe, has been elevated within a very recent period; and some\r\nparts of it, if not all of it, are still rising. The shells found on the\r\nplains from Brazil to Terra del Fuego, and on the Pacific coast, at a\r\nheight of from one hundred to thirteen hundred feet, are identical with\r\nthose now inhabiting the adjacent seas. And \"besides the organic\r\nremains, there are, in very many parts, marks of erosion, caves, ancient\r\nbeaches, sand-dunes, and successive terraces of gravel,\" all which must\r\nhave resulted from the action of the waves at a period not remote. At\r\nLima, articles of human skill peculiar to the original inhabitants of\r\nPeru were found imbedded in a mass of sea-shells eighty-three feet above\r\nthe present sea level. The elevation on the Pacific coast has been in\r\npart by sudden uplifts of a few feet at a time; but it is found, from\r\ntime to time, that there has been a change of level, amounting to a\r\nfoot or more in a year, when there have been none of these sudden\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of Europe, reaching from North Cape in Norway to\r\nnear the southern part of Sweden, more than a thousand miles, and from\r\nthe Atlantic to St. Petersburg, more than six hundred miles, has been\r\nrising at the rate of about three feet in a century, for at least two\r\ncenturies, and probably much longer. This change is proved by the\r\noccurrence, at considerable elevations above the sea, of shells now\r\nfound in the Baltic; by rocks once sunken, now raised above the surface\r\nof the sea, and by ancient seaports having become inland towns. To\r\ndetermine the truth by actual measurement, the Royal Academy of\r\nStockholm, about thirty-five years since, caused marks to be cut in the\r\nrocks along the coast, to indicate the ordinary level of the water. This\r\nis easily ascertained, as the Baltic is nearly a tideless sea. The\r\npresent level of the sea, compared with that indicated by the marks\r\nbefore mentioned, leaves no doubt that the country is rising.\r\n\r\n3. _The Subsidence of Land._--Elevations can be shown to have taken\r\nplace by fossils, and by other evidences of former sea levels which are\r\nleft on the surface; but depressions leave but few indications of change\r\nof level. It is yet doubtful whether the depression is equal to the\r\nelevation; that is, whether the amount of land remains nearly constant,\r\nor whether there has been an augmentation of the dry land within the\r\ntertiary and recent periods. We are certain that the augmentation, if\r\nany, has not been equal to the elevation, for subsidences to a great\r\namount are known to have taken place.\r\n\r\nThere are occasional instances of submerged forests seen at low tide, at\r\nsome distance from the shore. There are several near the coast of\r\nEngland and Scotland, and near the coast of Massachusetts. They are but\r\na few feet below low water, and do not indicate a subsidence of more\r\nthan about twenty feet.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances are on record of the sinking down of wharfs and\r\nbuildings near the sea during earthquakes. Almost every violent\r\nearthquake is accompanied by a change of level. The changes of this kind\r\nwhich have been noticed are in seaport towns, because greater facilities\r\nare there afforded for detecting them, and because loss of property\r\nawakens attention to them; but there is every reason to suppose that\r\nthese changes of level extend to great distances both into the country\r\nand into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\nAn immense area in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, probably ten millions\r\nof square miles, is undergoing change of level. The lines A B and D G\r\n(Fig. 60) represent nearly the axes of depression; while an intermediate\r\nand two exterior parallel lines would represent axes of elevation. The\r\nevidence of these changes is found principally in the peculiarities of\r\nthe wall of coral rock encircling the islands.\r\n\r\nThe following figures represent, in sections, modifications of form of\r\nthe same island. The coral wall built up around the island by the\r\npolyps, from the depth of fifty, or at most of a hundred feet, is shown\r\nat _c c_ (Fig. 61). If the island is elevated, this wall becomes a\r\n_fringing reef_ (Fig. 62), _b'_ becoming the level of the sea, and the\r\nanimal begins a new wall at the same depth as before. But if the island\r\nis gradually sinking, the wall is kept built up to the surface, and\r\nbecomes a _barrier reef_ (Fig. 63). A channel is thus left between the\r\nisland and the reef, which, though gradually filling up with broken\r\ncoral or other sediment, is generally deep enough for a ship-channel. If\r\nthe island continue to subside till it disappears, and the coral wall is\r\nstill kept at the surface, it then becomes an _atoll_, a circular coral\r\nisland (Fig. 64), often of many leagues in diameter, beaten by the surf\r\non the outer edge, but enclosing a quiet lake, which communicates only\r\nby occasional channels with the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nThe islands contiguous to the lines A B and C D (Fig. 60) are uniformly\r\natolls, or are surrounded by barrier reefs, and are therefore subsiding;\r\nwhile the islands at a distance from these lines are surrounded by\r\nfringing reefs, which indicate that they are rising.\r\n\r\nA well-authenticated instance of gradual subsidence is that of\r\nGreenland. The entire western coast, from its southern extremity to\r\nDisco Island, a distance of six hundred miles, has for the last two\r\ncenturies been slowly subsiding. The dwelling-houses and places of\r\nworship built by the early European settlers are now in part or entirely\r\nsubmerged. The natives are said to be aware of the subsidence, and never\r\nbuild their huts near the sea.\r\n\r\n4. We have thus seen that both elevation and depression may take place.\r\nThere is reason to believe that these changes of level have, in some\r\ncases, been several times repeated. In one of the eastern ranges of the\r\nAndes, opposite to Chili, there is a mass of marine strata of five\r\nthousand feet in thickness. About the middle of the series there occurs\r\na silicified forest. In one place a clump of coniferous trees was found\r\nof more than fifty in number, and a foot or more in diameter. The base\r\nof the strata must have been twenty-five hundred feet below the surface\r\nof the sea, in order to admit of the deposition of the first half of it.\r\nIt was then elevated, so that a forest grew upon its surface. It was\r\nthen depressed at least twenty-five hundred feet, more, to admit of the\r\ndeposition of the subsequent strata, and the whole is now uplifted to\r\nform a mountain range of eight thousand feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nThe temple of Jupiter Serapis, near Naples, in Italy, was built near the\r\nsea, about eighteen hundred years ago. It was gradually submerged, and\r\nfinally lost by the deposition of sediment nearly to the top of the\r\ncolumns. It was afterwards elevated, so as to be entirely above the\r\nlevel of the sea. The remains of the temple (Fig. 65) were afterwards\r\ndiscovered by the columns projecting a little above the ground. The\r\nsediment was removed to the depth of forty-six feet, when the workmen\r\ncame to the base of the columns, and to a pavement seventy feet in\r\ndiameter. In 1807 an artist was employed to take drawings of the ruin.\r\nThe pavement was then above the level of the sea. Sixteen years\r\nafterwards the same artist found the pavement covered with water, and\r\nthe depth has continued to increase since that time. It is considered\r\nthat for the last forty years the depression has been three-fourths of\r\nan inch a year.\r\n\r\nInstances enough have now been given to show how extensively the system\r\nadmits of change. They are sufficient to justify us in searching for\r\nindications of great revolutions in past times, even where no such\r\nindications have as yet been discovered. They will serve as a key to\r\nmany otherwise inexplicable phenomena, In order to the interpretation of\r\nsuch phenomena readily, we must cease to look upon these as exceptional\r\ncases, and regard them not only as facts, but as facts of frequent\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nFrom the examples which have now been given, as well as from\r\nspeculations upon the cause of these changes, it seems highly probable\r\nthat all the surface of the solid portion of the earth, whether land or\r\nthe bed of the sea, is undergoing changes of level. It may be so gradual\r\nthat in the life of an individual it would be imperceptible, even where\r\nthe best means of detecting it exist. These means are generally the\r\nworks of man, and they are themselves so liable to change, that it would\r\nbe scarcely possible to detect variations of level, which amount to but\r\na few inches in a century.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the relations of land and water have always been\r\nvariable, it is impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion as to the\r\namount, position or form, of the dry land at any former period. We may\r\ndetermine, with some degree of certainty, what portions of the present\r\ncontinents were submerged at particular epochs. Thus, we may infer that\r\nmost of this country was submerged during the silurian period, from the\r\ngreat extent of the Silurian rocks; and, from the limited extent of the\r\nchalk formation in this country, we know that during the cretaceous\r\nperiod most of the continent was above the surface of the sea. But we\r\nhave absolutely no data for determining what portions of the bed of the\r\nsea were at any time dry land.\r\n\r\nIt is supposable that the land has been principally confined to the\r\nequatorial regions at one period, and to the polar at another. At still\r\na different period the land may have existed as islands scattered\r\nthrough a general ocean. These relations may, therefore, be assumed to\r\nhave existed, if there are geological phenomena which best accord with\r\nsuch relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--CHANGES ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n1. The principal changes of this class consist in the wearing down and\r\nremoving immense quantities of the surface rock. The form in which the\r\n_igneous rocks_, of which the entire crust of the earth was originally\r\ncomposed, now appear, furnishes no assistance in judging of the amount\r\nof denudation which they have suffered. We can judge only from the\r\namount of rock for which they have furnished the materials, and these\r\nare the whole sedimentary series which exist both as dry land and as the\r\nbed of the sea.\r\n\r\n2. The _sedimentary rocks_ have also been subject to great denudation;\r\nand we often have, in what is left, some indications of how much has\r\nbeen removed. One of these indications consists in the now level surface\r\nof those portions of country in which large _faults_ exist. By the\r\nexcavations for coal, in England, faults have been discovered of five or\r\nsix hundred feet. At the time that they were formed, the surface must\r\nhave presented precipitous escarpments (as represented by the dotted\r\nlines in Fig. 50) of a height equal to the dislocation; but the whole is\r\nnow reduced to a general level (_z z_), denuding causes having removed\r\nthe elevated portions.\r\n\r\nThe extent of _valleys_ will often give some idea of the amount of\r\ndenudation to which a region has been subjected. In the north-west of\r\nScotland there is a succession of hills of about three thousand feet in\r\nelevation, consisting, for the upper two thousand feet, of horizontal\r\nstrata of old red sandstone. (Fig. 66.) We cannot conceive that these\r\nmountain masses were deposited in their present isolated form. The whole\r\nintervening spaces must have been filled with strata continuous with\r\nthose by which the elevations are formed.[D]\r\n\r\n  [D] \"I entertain little doubt that when this loftier\r\n      portion of Scotland, including the entire Highlands,\r\n      first presented its broad back over the waves, the\r\n      upper surface consisted exclusively, from one\r\n      extremity to the other, of a continuous tract of old\r\n      red sandstone; though, ere the land finally emerged,\r\n      the ocean currents of ages had swept it away, all\r\n      except in the lower and last raised borders, and in\r\n      detached localities where it still remains, as in the\r\n      pyramidal hills of Western Rosshire, to show the\r\n      amazing depth to which it had once overlaid the\r\n      inferior rocks.\"--_Miller, Old Red Sandstone_,\r\n      _p. 22_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar instance occurs in the Connecticut river sandstone,\r\nin the central part of Massachusetts. The following figure (Fig. 67)\r\nrepresents two mountains of 1 the sandstone, between which the\r\nConnecticut river flows. The dotted lines indicate a depth of one\r\nthousand feet of the rock which has been swept away. It is also thought\r\nthat a bed of equal depth has been removed from this section southward,\r\nthrough the State of Connecticut, to the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n3. _Valleys_, and even many of the larger valleys, are produced by the\r\nwearing down of the surface. The lower portion of the Connecticut valley\r\nis one of denudation, though in its upper part it is a valley of\r\nelevation, resulting from the upheaval of the Green and White Mountains.\r\nThe water-courses from the mountains are transverse to the direction of\r\nthe ranges, and generally consist of valleys of denudation. These\r\nvalleys were no doubt originally fractures, produced while the mountains\r\nwere rising. The fractures have been subsequently widened by denudation\r\ninto valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.]\r\n\r\n4. The rocky surface, beyond the fortieth parallels of latitude, and in\r\nthe vicinity of glacier-producing mountains, is generally covered with\r\n_grooves_ and _striæ_ (Fig. 68), varying from several inches in depth to\r\nthe finest perceptible lines. Rocks that are of a soft consistence, or\r\nwhich have been long exposed to atmospheric agents, seldom exhibit these\r\nmarks, though there are probably few places, outside of the parallels\r\nbefore mentioned, where the rocky surface, if it has been protected from\r\natmospheric decay, does not contain such grooving.\r\n\r\n5. Another change at the surface consists in the formation of a _soil_;\r\nthat is, of a superficial layer, of no great thickness, of earthy\r\nmatter, a large proportion of which is always in a minutely divided\r\nstate. In some instances it is common sediment, unsolidified; in\r\nothers, it consists of the surface rock in a state of disintegration;\r\nbut a large part of the soil within the region where the grooved\r\nsurfaces are found consists of materials transported from a distance.\r\n\r\nSoils are distinguished according to their predominant minerals, as\r\nsiliceous, aluminous and calcareous. If siliceous matter is in excess,\r\nit will be a light, warm soil, and allow the water to pass through it\r\ntoo freely. If the clay predominates, the soil is cold, stiff, and too\r\nretentive of moisture. A proper admixture of these three ingredients\r\nconstitutes the best soils. There are some other mineral ingredients\r\nessential to the productiveness of soils, but they are always in small\r\nproportion. In addition to the inorganic part which is common to the\r\nupper soil, and the subsoil, there is required, in order to render the\r\nupper layer productive, a large admixture of decaying animal and\r\nvegetable matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--CHANGES OF CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nOur means of determining the climate of any former period consists in a\r\ncomparison of the fossils of such period with the existing forms of life\r\nin warm and cold climates.\r\n\r\nThe earliest abundant _vegetation_ consisted principally of ferns,\r\nrushes and mosses, and a larger growth was attained than is attained by\r\nany of the allied forms of the present time. We may infer that the\r\ncircumstances under which these lower forms of vegetable life are now\r\nproduced in the largest proportion, compared with other forms, and under\r\nwhich they grow to the largest size, are the circumstances approaching\r\nmost nearly those under which the early vegetation was produced. These\r\ncircumstances are found to be a position elevated but little above the\r\nlevel of the sea, a humid atmosphere, and the highest terrestrial\r\ntemperature. Such facts favor the conclusion that during the coal period\r\nan ultra-tropical climate prevailed, and that the land existed in the\r\nform of low islands, thickly set in a general ocean.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar characters of some of the _animal fossils_, from the\r\nearliest fossiliferous to the tertiary series, indicate that a warmer\r\nclimate prevailed during their formation than now exists. The remains of\r\nmarine animals, such as the cephalopoda, are found in great numbers and\r\nin high latitudes, in a fossil state; but similar species, as the\r\nnautilus, now abound only between the tropics. The same is true of the\r\ncrinoidea. Coralline limestone is also found in great abundance and in\r\nhigh northern latitudes; but the stone-producing coral now exists only\r\nin very warm seas. The remains of saurian reptiles are numerous in the\r\noölite and Wealden; but all the larger recent species of the lizard\r\ntribe, such as the crocodile, are confined to the warmer regions of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nA former warm climate in Siberia is indicated by the occurrence there of\r\nthe remains of elephants. These animals were so abundant that their\r\ntusks are now collected as an article of commerce. The abundance and\r\nhigh state of preservation of these remains seem to preclude the\r\nexplanation that they were conveyed there, from the present tropical\r\nregions, by any great geological convulsion. The species must therefore\r\nhave inhabited the country, though the elephant is now found only\r\nbetween the tropics. The Siberian elephant was a different species from\r\nany now existing, and, unlike the recent species, had a covering of\r\ncoarse hair. There is, however, no reason to conclude that it could\r\nendure a continued low temperature; and its sustenance would have been\r\nimpossible, from the very stinted vegetation which that region now\r\naffords. We must therefore suppose that Siberia enjoyed, at the period\r\nwhen it supported these animals in such abundance, a tropical climate.\r\n\r\nMost of the facts which go to prove a change of climate have been\r\nobserved in the northern hemisphere; but the explorations in South\r\nAmerica and New Holland furnish ground for believing that the geological\r\nphenomena of the two hemispheres are essentially alike, and that the\r\nindications of climate are the same for the same periods.\r\n\r\nSuch is, in general, the evidence in reference to climate; and it leads\r\nto the conclusion that a highly tropical climate prevailed in the\r\ntemperate, and for some distance, at least, into the polar zones, in the\r\nearly geological periods; while there is no reason for supposing that\r\nthe tropical regions experienced a temperature too high for physical\r\nlife to endure it. The climate of the earth was characterized then by a\r\nhigher temperature than now, and by greater uniformity. This was the\r\nclimate, with perhaps a gradual reduction of temperature, till the later\r\nportions of the tertiary period.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the tertiary period, a change occurred, and probably\r\na rapid one, to a more rigorous climate than now exists. The destruction\r\nof the elephant in Siberia was evidently sudden, and was followed by\r\nextreme cold; for the animals are in some cases entirely preserved in\r\nice, and in so perfect a state that, when the ice which surrounds them\r\nbecomes melted, the flesh is devoured by carnivorous animals. There are\r\noccasionally found, in the drift of the boulder period, shells similar\r\nto those of the Arctic regions, and in a condition to show that they\r\nhave not been transported. The clay beds of the northern portion of the\r\nUnited States and of Canada were deposited during the last depression of\r\nthat portion of the continent, and they contain the remains of marine\r\nanimals identical in several instances with species now living, but\r\nconfined to more northern regions. It must therefore be admitted that\r\nthe interval between the middle tertiary and the modern era was one of\r\ngreat cold. It is generally referred to as the _Glacial period_.\r\n\r\nVery considerable local changes of climate have also occurred within the\r\nhistorical period. Thus the mean temperature of the Alps has been so\r\nreduced that the ancient passes have in modern times become choked up\r\nwith snow, and other passes have been sought,--a result, perhaps, of\r\nadditional upheaval. It would seem that Siberia is now receiving a\r\nmilder climate. The ice in which elephants have for centuries been\r\nimbedded has been slowly melting for at least thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.--ADVANTAGES RESULTING FROM GEOLOGICAL CHANGES.\r\n\r\n1. The division of the general surface into land and water, as well as\r\nthe diversified form of the land, the existence of mountains and low\r\nlands, and the consequent modifications of climate, the waterfalls, and\r\nthe river-systems, constituting the drainage of continents, are all\r\nresults of the process of upheaval.\r\n\r\n2. A large part of the mineral substances employed for architectural and\r\neconomical purposes are oceanic deposits, such as the marbles, slates,\r\nsandstones and mineral salt, and would have been inaccessible if they\r\nhad not been elevated from the position in which they were formed. And\r\nthe elevation of them above the bed of the sea would have exposed only\r\nthe superficial layer, if they had not been either irregularly uplifted,\r\nas at _e c_ (Fig. 69), or unequally worn down, as at _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nThe granitic rocks, as they were formed below the aqueous rocks, must\r\nhave remained unknown and useless, if they had not been brought to the\r\nsurface, as at _c_, by the most convulsive efforts of nature of which we\r\nhave any knowledge. Thus, natural mechanical forces have effected for\r\nman what the mechanical forces under his control would be entirely\r\ninsufficient to accomplish.\r\n\r\n3. It is by changes of this kind that we become acquainted with the\r\ngeological structure of the crust of the earth. Mining operations have\r\nnever extended to a greater depth than three thousand feet, while the\r\ninclined position of the strata exposes for examination, along their\r\noutcropping edges, _e a c_, the whole series, even to the primary rocks.\r\nThe upheaval of the granitic rocks, and the removal by denudation of the\r\noverlying deposits, shows us the crystalline character which the earthy\r\nmaterials take, when subjected to pressure and cooled from fusion with\r\nextreme slowness. Thus we have, exposed to observation, the process of\r\nnature in the formation and modification of rocks for several miles in\r\ndepth. Of the central portions, however, including by far the largest\r\npart of the mass of the earth, we have no knowledge whatever.\r\n\r\n4. _Springs_, and the other means of obtaining water for domestic\r\npurposes, depend in part upon the inclined position of strata, and the\r\nbroken and uneven condition of the surface, and in part upon the\r\nalternation of permeable and impermeable strata. If all the strata were\r\nporous, like the sandstones, the water which falls upon the surface\r\nwould gradually settle through them to the level of the sea; or, if they\r\nwere all impermeable, like the clays, the water would pass over the\r\nsurface, and be collected in lakes or the ocean. As it is, the porous\r\nstructure of the soil and of some rocks acts as a reservoir, from which\r\nthe water is gradually discharged, and the intervention of impermeable\r\nstrata prevents its taking a perpendicular direction downwards. Thus, if\r\nthe stratum _e b_ (Fig. 69) consists of porous rock, and the one below\r\nis impermeable, the water which is absorbed at _e_ will appear at _b_ as\r\na spring. Or, if the line _a d_ is a fracture, the water received at c\r\nmay reappear as a spring at _a_. If the strata were perforated by boring\r\nat _e_ till the porous stratum _a_ is reached, the water will rise to\r\nthe surface, constituting an _Artesian well_. An ordinary well consists\r\nof an excavation continued till a stratum is reached which is\r\npermanently saturated with water.\r\n\r\n5. Most of the _metallic ores_ which occur in the stratified rocks, with\r\nthe exception of iron, are found in fractures or as dikes. Without\r\nthese disturbances of the strata, the ores would have remained either\r\nsparingly diffused throughout the adjacent strata, or as a part of the\r\nmelted mass at the volcanic centres. The ores and metals which are found\r\nin the primary rocks are accessible only by the bringing up of these\r\nrocks to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe fracturing, displacement, and elevation of the strata, attended, as\r\nis often the case, with the destruction of property and of the life both\r\nof man and the inferior animals, might, at first view, be thought an\r\nunnecessary, if not a wanton infringement upon arrangements already\r\nestablished. But the results which we have noticed, though by no means a\r\nfull enumeration of the advantages resulting from geological changes,\r\nare sufficient to show that even the more violent disturbances to which\r\nthe crust of the earth has been subjected constitute an important part\r\nof that series of adjustments which has rendered it a suitable abode for\r\nhuman beings. These changes are therefore neither useless nor\r\naccidental, but are essential parts of a wise and beneficent system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE CAUSES OF GEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exhibition of the _composition and structure of the earth_, together\r\nwith an account, as far as there is reliable evidence, of the\r\nmodifications which they have undergone, has been the object of the\r\npreceding chapters. They are mainly a collection and classification of\r\nobserved facts. No reference has been made to causes or modes of\r\noperation, except in a few cases where it was necessary in order that a\r\nstatement or description, might be intelligible.\r\n\r\nIf the facts have been given with sufficient clearness and detail to\r\nconvey a correct general idea of the crust of the earth, we are prepared\r\nto inquire what are the agencies employed, and how they have operated in\r\nproducing it. It is the province of the geologist to question every\r\nknown power in nature, and to ascertain what geological effects each one\r\nis now producing; and, observing what effects are produced by given\r\ncauses, he is to judge of the causes which have produced like effects in\r\npast geological periods.\r\n\r\nSome of these causes are in their nature limited, and effects can be\r\nreferred to them only within those limits. Thus, the congelation of\r\nwater expands it by a certain proportion of its volume, and beyond that\r\nit can have no effect. But the expansive power of steam varies with the\r\ntemperature; and hence the effects referred to it may be equally varied.\r\nThus, we are not to expect exact uniformity of results in all past\r\ntimes, but _the results will vary only as the circumstances vary_ upon\r\nwhich the operation of these causes depends.\r\n\r\nGeological causes, in most instances, operate with extreme slowness; and\r\ntherefore it will require a series of observations, continued for a long\r\ntime, to ascertain what are the capabilities of these causes. But a\r\nsingle instance of their effects proves their capabilities thus far.\r\nHence, one instance of the deposition of a stratum of salt in a salt\r\nlake; of the filling of a fracture with fluid lava; of a volcanic\r\neruption, like that of Iceland in 1783; of the subsidence of a volcanic\r\nmountain, as that of Papandayang in Java; or of the rising of a large\r\narea of land, as in Sweden, as fully proves that natural causes exist\r\ncapable of producing these effects, as if the effects were produced\r\ndaily. As these effects increase in number, and careful observations are\r\nmade and authentic accounts preserved, the means of correctly explaining\r\ngeological phenomena will increase. The causes thus far known are\r\nAtmospheric Causes, Chemical Action, Organic Agency, and Aqueous,\r\nAqueo-glacial and Igneous Action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--ATMOSPHERIC CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen of the atmosphere is capable of uniting with some of the\r\nconstituents of rocks, by which their cohesion is weakened or destroyed.\r\nThis is the cause of the rapid disintegration of some varieties of\r\ngranite. The protoxide of iron which they contain is converted, by\r\ncontact with the atmosphere, into the peroxide. Its volume is thus\r\nincreased, and portions of the rock are separated from the mass. When\r\ngranite or limestone contains sulphuret of iron, the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere, in connection with moisture, combines with the sulphur,\r\nforming sulphuric acid, by which limestone and the felspar of granite\r\nare rapidly decomposed. Hence, a rock which contains an oxide or\r\nsulphuret of iron should not be used for architectural purposes.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid is another constituent of the atmosphere which operates as\r\na decomposing agent. The water that falls from the atmosphere is charged\r\nwith it, and thus becomes capable of dissolving calcareous rocks.\r\nCarbonic acid is thus indirectly the means of the rapid destruction of\r\nrocks of this class. It is also believed that carbonic acid enters into\r\ndirect combination with some of the constituents of rocks, and\r\nparticularly felspar; for it is found that in those countries where\r\ncarbonic acid issues in great quantities from the earth, the rocks,\r\nespecially those which contain felspar, disintegrate rapidly. Masses of\r\nmany tons' weight, which appear to be solid granite, after being broken\r\nare found to be in such a state of decay that fragments may be reduced\r\nto sand between the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe moisture of the atmosphere has some effect as a decomposing agent.\r\nRocks which are exposed to frequent alternations of moisture and dryness\r\nsoon crumble into fragments. Rain, falling upon the surface of rock,\r\nproduces, mechanically, a destroying effect, which is not to be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nVariations of temperature, especially those alternations above and below\r\nthe freezing point, have greater influence than any other cause in the\r\ndestruction of rocks. When the water with which a rock is saturated\r\ncongeals, the resulting expansion tends to enlarge the interstices, and\r\nthus to separate the particles of the rock. When the ice melts, the\r\nparticles fail to resume the closeness of arrangement with which they\r\nwere before packed. By frequent repetition of this action, the\r\nsuperficial portion loses its cohesion, and disintegrates. It is also\r\nfound that in the region of perpetual snow the surface of the mountain\r\nmasses is covered with rock in a disintegrated or fragmentary state, in\r\ngreater abundance than below the snow line; but no explanation of this\r\nfact has yet been found.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous regions, electrical discharges and violent storms have\r\nsome destroying effect. Winds have considerable power in changing the\r\nplace of earthy matter in a disintegrated state. In deserts, the sands\r\nare carried in great quantities to great distances.\r\n\r\nThe causes now enumerated, when considered separately, and as acting for\r\nonly limited periods of time, seem hardly worthy of notice; but when\r\nconsidered as operating conjointly, and for indefinite periods of time,\r\nthey must have produced important changes on the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes, the surface and ornaments of castles and other\r\nancient edifices, and of boulders, and all insulated rocks, are found to\r\nbe decayed, and often to a considerable depth. It is from these causes\r\nthat a soil is produced on every surface of rock which is not so exposed\r\nto the action of currents that the debris is removed as fast as it is\r\nformed. Hence it is, also, that a slope of detritus is formed at the\r\nbase of every declivity, so that the ledge appears only at the highest\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nIt is from a combination of these atmospheric causes that a large part\r\nof the sediment is furnished which brooks and rivers carry away. And\r\nwhen cohesion is not entirely overcome, it is so far weakened that other\r\ncauses are much more effectual than they would otherwise be, in\r\neffecting the disintegration of rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--CHEMICAL ACTION.\r\n\r\nAll those changes in which the action is molecular,--that is, between\r\nthe molecules as such, and not between the masses,--including the\r\neffects of the imponderable substances, we regard as resulting from\r\nchemical agency.\r\n\r\nUnder the control of these molecular forces the crystalline rocks have\r\ntaken their form; and if the crust of the earth could have remained in a\r\nfixed condition, in which these forces would have been in equilibrium,\r\nno further chemical action could have taken place. But, instead of being\r\nin a fixed condition, the present system is one of perpetual change.\r\nVarious disturbances of this equilibrium of forces,--such, for instance,\r\nas the diurnal and annual changes of temperature at the surface, and the\r\nstill greater secular changes of temperature at great depths,--will\r\nbring the chemical forces into operation. The mechanical disintegration\r\nof the crystalline rocks, and the deposition of them in strata\r\nindependently of the chemical affinity of their particles, will give\r\noccasion for chemical changes,--that is, for a rearrangement of the\r\nparticles in accordance with their affinities,--whenever any movement of\r\nthe particles among themselves can take place. These movements take\r\nplace, to a very great extent, under the influence of electrical\r\ncurrents, and of change of temperature, even while the masses retain\r\ntheir solid form.\r\n\r\nChemical affinity has exhibited itself on the largest scale in the\r\nformation of the various mineral species of which the crust of the earth\r\nis composed; but we may also refer to the same cause the formation of\r\ndivisional planes in rocks, the concretionary arrangement, and mineral\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n1. _Divisional Planes._--It has before been stated, that the older\r\nrocks, in many cases, cleave freely in planes not parallel with the\r\nstratification. (See Fig. 48.) In some instances, in beds of lava, a\r\nsimilar cleavage exists, sufficiently perfect to allow of its use as a\r\nroofing material. In these cases, there must have been a rearrangement\r\nof the particles, so that their axes of greatest attraction would lie in\r\nparallel planes; the same arrangement which exists in mica and other\r\ncrystalline substances, which have one and but one free cleavage.\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement has sometimes taken place under such circumstances\r\nas to submit the process to more careful scrutiny. In the gold mines of\r\nChili, the powder from which the gold has been washed is \"thrown into a\r\ncommon heap. A great deal of chemical action then commences; salts of\r\nvarious kinds effloresce on the surface, and the mass becomes hard, and\r\ndivides into fragments which possess _an even and well-defined slaty\r\nstructure_.\" When a portion of clay, worked into a paste with a very\r\nweak acid, is submitted to a weak voltaic action for several months, and\r\nthen dried, it is found to have acquired a distinct though imperfect\r\ncleavage structure.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that both electrical currents and ordinary chemical\r\naction are capable of arranging the particles of an earthy mass into\r\nseparable layers. We may then regard this change in the older rocks as\r\nan imperfect crystallization, and probably induced by electro-chemical\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nIt is also found that all rocks are divided into huge blocks by seams\r\nnot parallel with the cleavage, and too regular to be considered as\r\nfractures. These seams bear an analogy to the secondary faces of\r\ncrystals, which are never parallel to the cleavage.\r\n\r\n2. _Concretionary Formations._--There exist in many rocks concretions\r\nwhich differ from the mass of the rocks. In most of the tertiary clays\r\nthere are small concretionary nodules, which contain more calcareous\r\nmatter than the mass of clay around them. In the coal formation, the\r\nnodular iron ore consists of concretionary masses. In the chalk\r\nformation, nodules of flint abound, and generally in layers. In many of\r\nthese cases, particularly in the clays and coal, the nodules have an\r\norganic nucleus, and, although concretionary, they retain the marks of\r\nstratification of the adjacent rocks. Hence they could not have been\r\ndeposited in the form of nodules. There must therefore have been in the\r\nrock, though in the solid state, such motion among the molecules that\r\nparticles of a particular mineral have separated from the mass and\r\nrearranged themselves in concretionary layers, yet so gradually as not\r\nto disturb the lines of original stratification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\nThere are other instances, similar to the last in all respects, except\r\nthat the segregated portion does not take the concretionary form. When\r\ngypsum is distributed in small proportion through a formation, there\r\nseems very little reason to doubt but that it is, by a molecular action,\r\nsegregated from the strata in lenticular masses, as at a (Fig. 70). Many\r\nof the limestone strata contain irregular aggregations of quartz. It is\r\npresumed that the siliceous and calcareous matter was deposited together\r\nas sediment, and that the aggregation has resulted from a movement among\r\nthe particles similar to that by which the concretionary structure is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe columnar structure of basalt seems to have resulted from a peculiar\r\nmolecular action, at first resembling a concretionary arrangement, while\r\nthe mass was cooling from a state of fusion. In experimenting to\r\nascertain the cause of this structure, Mr. Watt fused in a furnace seven\r\nhundred pounds of basalt. When cooled, he found that \"numerous spheroids\r\nhad been formed, and that when two of them came in contact, they did not\r\npenetrate each other, but were mutually compressed and separated by a\r\nwell-defined plane, invested with a rusty coating. When several met,\r\nthey formed prisms.\" (Fig. 71.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.]\r\n\r\n3. _Mineral Veins._--The phenomena of veins are such that they cannot\r\nall be referred to the same cause. In some, the vein-stuff has been\r\nprotruded as a dike, differing from ordinary dikes only in the\r\naccidental circumstance that it contains a metal or a metallic ore.\r\n\r\nMineral veins are not, however, generally filled by injection from\r\nbelow. It is found that those veins only are productive which have an\r\neast and west direction. But injected dikes run in all directions. The\r\nore often varies in richness at different depths in the vein, or passes\r\ninto ore of some other metal. The ore also varies in kind and quality,\r\naccording to the character of the rock through which the vein passes.\r\nThese phenomena are best explained by supposing that the sediment of\r\nwhich the strata were formed contained the mineral substances of these\r\nveins in small proportion. After they were solidified, and fractures had\r\nbeen formed, the mineral substance was transferred by molecular action\r\nto the fissures, and deposited.\r\n\r\nIt was shown by the early experiments of Davy, that voltaic currents are\r\ncapable of taking up mineral substances from their solutions, and\r\nremoving them from one cup to another. It has been ascertained that in\r\nmost mineral veins a proper apparatus will detect the existence of\r\nelectric currents. It may be regarded as certain, that the unequal\r\nheating of different parts of the surface at the same time, by the sun,\r\ncauses a vast current of feeble intensity to circulate around the earth\r\nonce in twenty-four hours. The unequal distribution of heat below the\r\nsurface may also produce currents subject to other laws. We should\r\nexpect that these currents would take up the mineral substances diffused\r\nthrough rocks, and deposit them by themselves. It seems probable,\r\ntherefore, that the molecular action, from which the segregation of\r\nmetallic veins has resulted, was that of voltaic currents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--ORGANIC CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe effects of all organic causes in producing geological changes are\r\ninconsiderable, compared with those of inorganic causes. With the\r\nexception of the coral formation, the most important of these effects\r\nare those produced by human agency. We find examples of this agency in\r\nthe distribution of animals and plants beyond the regions where they are\r\nindigenous; in the increased numbers of certain species, and in the\r\ndiminution, if not extinction, of others; in the modifications of\r\nclimate, dependent on the destruction of the forests and the cultivation\r\nof the soil; in controlling the course of rivers; in arresting by\r\nembankments the encroachments of the sea; in breaking up and changing\r\nthe place of great quantities of rock by mining and engineering\r\noperations; and in the increased quantity of sediment furnished to\r\nstreams by cultivating the surface, and thus preventing the protecting\r\ninfluence which the matted roots of trees and the smaller vegetables\r\nwould otherwise have. Such effects, though attributable mainly to man,\r\nare produced in some degree by all other animals.\r\n\r\nBesides these general effects, it is the existence of organic forms that\r\nhas conferred on all the sedimentary rocks their fossiliferous\r\ncharacter. _The records_ of the climate of each geological period, of\r\nthe physical geography, of the vegetable productions, and of the animal\r\nforms by which the earth was peopled, consist in the remains of the\r\nliving beings of these several periods, imbedded in the contemporaneous\r\nrock formations. But in the sediment deposited since the human era\r\nthere must have been furnished both the remains of human beings and\r\nworks of art, such as implements of labor and war, pottery, coins,\r\nfragments of ships, &c.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the _quantity of material_ which has been furnished by organic\r\ncauses is by no means small. The coal-beds are the product of vegetable\r\ngrowth exclusively. We not unfrequently find strata of great extent\r\nconsisting almost entirely of the shells of molluscous animals, of the\r\nstems of encrinites, or of the shields of microscopic animalcules.\r\n\r\nBut the most abundant rock which can be regarded as the product of\r\nanimal organization is the _coral formation_. It consists of immense\r\nwalls of coral limestone, separating either an atoll or the land of an\r\nisland or continent from the open sea. The base of this wall has a width\r\nvarying from a hundred feet to a mile or more, and the outer edge of it\r\nis at such a distance from the shore as to give a depth not much\r\nexceeding a hundred feet. Over this area of the bed of the sea, which\r\nforms the base of the wall, the coral polyp commenced its work.\r\nAttaching itself in immense numbers over this area, it deposits\r\ncalcareous matter from its under surface, and thus, by degrees, elevates\r\nitself towards the surface of the water, till it reaches a level a\r\nlittle above low-water mark. The height of the wall would not, with\r\nthese conditions, exceed one hundred feet; but some hundreds of the\r\nislands surrounded by coral walls are gradually subsiding. The\r\ndepositions of the polyps keep pace with the subsidence, so that this\r\nwall has reached an elevation from its base of a thousand feet, and in\r\none instance of two thousand feet. (See Figs. 61, 62, 63, 64.)\r\n\r\nMost of the islands of the torrid zone are thus surrounded with coral\r\nreefs, except a few where the cold polar currents reduce the temperature\r\ntoo low to admit of their growth. In one instance, along the north-east\r\ncoast of New Holland, there is a coral reef, some twenty-five miles from\r\nthe land, which has a continuous extension, excepting occasional inlets\r\nof no great depth, of a thousand miles. The reef along the island of New\r\nCaledonia is four hundred miles long. A large number of other reefs have\r\na nearly equal extension. There is thus an area of several thousands of\r\nsquare miles covered to a great depth with this coralline limestone.\r\nSome limestone formations of great extent among the older rocks were the\r\nwork of similar animals. These lower forms of organization have,\r\ntherefore, always been important geological agents, both in collecting\r\nthe carbonate of lime from its solution in the waters of the ocean, and\r\nin depositing it as solid rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--AQUEOUS CAUSES.\r\n\r\nWater is, next to heat, the most important geological agent. All the\r\nstratified rocks are aqueous deposits, and their total amount is in some\r\nrespects a measure of the influence which this agent has exerted. The\r\nmaterials have been obtained from the destruction of preëxisting rocks,\r\ntransported by water, and deposited in layers.\r\n\r\nWhen the first strata were formed, the sediment must have been obtained\r\nentirely from igneous rocks, because only those rocks existed; but now\r\nit is obtained from every kind of rock which is exposed to abrading or\r\ndecomposing agencies. Hence, many of the later formations contain\r\nfragments, and sometimes within the fragments well-characterized\r\nfossils, of earlier formations.\r\n\r\nThe sediment which is ultimately to become stratified rock is deposited\r\non the beds of the ocean, and other great reservoirs of water. The\r\nformation of most of the aqueous rocks, therefore, as well as of the\r\nigneous rocks, is deep below the surface; and neither of these\r\noperations, on the large scale, is directly exposed to our observation.\r\nWe may, however, learn by observation, how the sediment is furnished to\r\nthe waters and transported by them, and we can form some correct ideas\r\nof the manner in which it will be laid down on the bed of the ocean, and\r\nsolidified.\r\n\r\nI. _The Furnishing of Sediment._\r\n\r\n1. Almost all the minerals which occur in the geological formations are,\r\nto some slight extent, _soluble in water_. Hence, rain water, by\r\npassing through a stratum of earth or rock and reäppearing as a spring,\r\nloses the insipidity which it had as pure water, and becomes palatable.\r\nIt is then found to hold in solution some small proportion of earthy\r\nsubstances, upon which this change of taste depends. Although the\r\nproportion of dissolved matter is very small, yet the surface of earth\r\nupon which this distilled water is shed is one-fourth of the surface of\r\nthe globe, and solution below all that surface is constantly taking\r\nplace. No inconsiderable amount must thus have been furnished, from the\r\nexisting rocks of each period, towards the formation of the strata of a\r\nlater period.\r\n\r\nThere are some substances which are soluble in water, in large\r\nquantities. _Rock-salt_ is an example. It is not found in any very large\r\nproportion in rocks generally, but a very large aggregate amount has\r\nbeen taken up by the waters which have filtered through the strata. The\r\nocean gathers into itself, by degrees, all the soluble substances which\r\nare thus taken up. It receives supplies of water charged with these\r\nsubstances from springs, rivers and lakes. It returns as much water as\r\nit receives; but it is always in the form of vapor, and is therefore\r\npure water. Hence the saline properties of the ocean, and of those\r\ninland seas which have no outlets. There is thus gathered the materials\r\nfor the rock-salt deposits.\r\n\r\nBut many substances which are not considered soluble in water become so\r\nby some modification of the water. Water of a high temperature is\r\ncapable of dissolving silex. In Iceland and other volcanic regions, the\r\nhot springs are charged with silex, which is deposited as the water\r\ncools. Thus, siliceous formations accumulate around springs of this\r\nkind. The various agates may have been deposited from such solutions.\r\n\r\nIn the decomposition of mica, felspar and volcanic rocks, a considerable\r\namount of potassa is set free. Potassa or soda renders the water in\r\nwhich it is dissolved capable of dissolving silex in large quantity. In\r\nthese ways water removes, with some degree of rapidity, one of the most\r\ninsoluble minerals which rocks contain.\r\n\r\nIn volcanic countries, and in coal districts, carbonic acid is abundant,\r\nboth in spring-water and in the gaseous form. Water charged with this\r\ngas becomes capable of dissolving limestone. Where the water is exposed\r\nto the air, the gas gradually escapes, and the calcareous matter is\r\ndeposited. Many accumulations of this kind are now taking place. Some\r\nhave already extended several miles in length, and they are often of\r\ngreat thickness, in one instance, in Italy, two hundred feet (Fig. 72).\r\nIt is also probable that many calcareous springs issue below the surface\r\nof lakes and seas, and thus, both fresh-water and marine deposits would\r\nnow be forming. These formations are distinctly stratified, and are\r\nwhite and crystalline, and become solid at the time of deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.]\r\n\r\nThese dissolved materials are less observed than others, because they do\r\nnot render the water turbid; but there is reason to believe that several\r\nof the aqueous formations, particularly the limestones, have been built\r\nup chiefly from them.\r\n\r\n2. The _abrading action of rivers_ furnishes considerable detrital\r\nmatter. The general form of the river courses is determined by other\r\ncauses than the agency of the river itself, yet a river which has a\r\nrapid current is continually deepening its channel. We have proof of\r\nthis by observing, when the water is low, that irregularity of surface\r\nwhich running water always produces, by wearing away the softer parts of\r\nthe rock, and leaving the harder in relief. Hence, a river will have its\r\nrapids either where the hardest strata occur, and which therefore wear\r\ndown least rapidly, or where the rock has been hardened by the intrusion\r\nor near proximity of dikes.\r\n\r\nThe abrading power of rivers occasionally becomes greatly increased by\r\nwaterfalls. The force which the water acquires in its descent is such as\r\nto excavate a deep cavity at the foot of the fall, reaching back under\r\nthe ledge from which the water descends. The ledge is therefore\r\nconstantly being undermined. The cataract of Niagara is peculiar, in\r\nhaving the rock at its base of a soft and friable texture, so that it is\r\nrapidly worn away, while the upper rock is a compact siliceous\r\nlimestone. If the order of superposition had been the reverse, the falls\r\nwould have been converted into a series of rapids. It is now preserved\r\nas a single fall, and as such it has probably cut the gorge, about two\r\nhundred feet deep and seven miles in length, through which its waters\r\nnow reach Lake Ontario. A few years since, a large mass, perhaps half an\r\nacre in area, fell from the centre of the horse-shoe fall. Another mass\r\nof equal size has recently fallen from the western extremity of the\r\nledge. Thus the fall is gradually receding.\r\n\r\nBut the foreign substances, such as drift-wood, ice, sand and gravel,\r\nwith which the waters of a river are occasionally charged, contribute\r\nmore than everything else to its abrading power. At such times its\r\nvolume is generally greatest, and its current the most rapid. Its bed is\r\nthen sometimes perceptibly deepened and widened in a few hours.\r\n\r\nMuch the greater part, however, of the earthy matter which rivers convey\r\nin such quantity to the ocean, is furnished by other means than the\r\neroding action of the river itself. It is the loose material, the soil\r\nand alluvium, to which the solid rocks have been reduced by the\r\nimperceptible but incessantly operating atmospheric agencies, from which\r\nmost of the sediment of rivers is obtained. After a rain, every\r\ntributary rivulet is turbid with suspended earthy matter, and it is from\r\nthese sources that the larger streams receive the most of their\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nSome observations have been made for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\nquantity of sediment which rivers annually carry into the sea. The\r\nKennebec furnishes materials which, if spread evenly on an area of one\r\nmile square, and consolidated into rock of the specific gravity of\r\ngranite, would have a thickness of six inches. The Merrimac furnishes\r\nabout two-thirds as much, the Ganges about two hundred and fifty times\r\nas much, and the Mississippi two thousand times as much.\r\n\r\nThus, the tendency is, to reduce the highest parts of the land, and to\r\nfill up the depressions of the sea; and though we have not data enough\r\nto form any reliable estimate of the total annual discharge of sediment\r\ninto the ocean by rivers, yet they are sufficient to show that the\r\neffects of this kind are on a large scale, and to relieve us from any\r\nimpression that existing agencies are inadequate to the production of\r\nthe stratified rocks.\r\n\r\n3. _The action of waves_ is another means by which detrital matter is\r\nfurnished. Wherever the shore consists of loose materials, and is\r\nfavorably situated to be acted upon by the waves, there is annually a\r\nsensible encroachment of the sea. Such encroachments are rapidly making\r\nin many places; and thus a large amount of sediment is delivered to the\r\nwaters of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe waves also encroach upon the coast when it consists of rocks, even\r\nof the most indestructible kinds. They continually beat upon it,\r\nundermine the cliffs, and precipitate them into the sea. The tides\r\nincrease the power of the waves, by varying the place of their action,\r\nso as to present the same surface of rock alternately to the action of\r\nwater and of the air, frost and sun. During storms, the waves have\r\nsufficient force to break off fragments of rock from the escarpment,\r\nsometimes in masses weighing twenty tons or more, and remove them many\r\nrods inland.\r\n\r\nA bold, rocky coast always exhibits evidence of a great amount of\r\nerosion. The steep escarpments and the high rugged shafts of rock (Fig.\r\n73) against which the waves now beat are the remnants of masses of rock\r\nwhich once extended further into the sea, but have been worn away by the\r\nwaves. It is by such agency that the deep inlets and harbors of the\r\ncoast of New England and Nova Scotia have been excavated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.]\r\n\r\nThis more violent action of the waves is only occasional; but when of\r\nless power, they are incessantly rolling the loosened fragments of rock\r\nupon each other, and thus wearing them down to particles small enough to\r\nbe carried away by the water.\r\n\r\n4. The action of waves is confined to the coast, and never extends to\r\ngreat depths. But _marine currents_ act principally on the bed of the\r\nsea. The temperature of the mass of the ocean is much higher in the\r\nequatorial than in the polar regions. At the surface, the difference\r\namounts to sixty degrees. The waters of the torrid zone are thus\r\nexpanded, and flow over the colder waters of the north and south; while\r\nthese colder waters of the polar seas flow back, in an under current,\r\ntowards the equator.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason,--a difference of temperature,--there will be, in\r\nthe higher regions of the atmosphere, a current of warm and moist air\r\nflowing from the equator north and south, while the cold and dry air\r\nconies in from the polar regions towards the equator. In this way the\r\nequatorial waters are carried, in a state of vapor, towards the poles,\r\nwhere they are condensed, and go to increase the currents of water\r\nmoving towards the equator.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general causes of the oceanic movements in a north and\r\nsouth direction; but these currents at once become deflected westward,\r\nby the diurnal revolution of the earth, as the trade winds do. Hence\r\nthere results a Pacific equatorial current, which has a motion of about\r\nthirty miles a day, and an Atlantic equatorial current, moving from\r\nsixty to seventy miles a day. The principal marine currents are shown in\r\nFig. 74.\r\n\r\nThe currents moving towards the poles are superficial, and therefore do\r\nnot produce any marked geological effects. But the polar currents, and\r\nthose which are produced from them, are of great depth, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose that they do not move, from their commencement, along\r\nthe bed of the ocean. There is also reason to suppose that they exist at\r\ngreat depths, where the opposing superficial currents entirely conceal\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWherever these currents come to the surface, their motion is undoubtedly\r\ngreater than it is at the bottom, where it is retarded by the friction\r\nwhich the moving waters encounter, and by the irregularities of the bed\r\nof the ocean. It should, however, be remembered, that they move with the\r\nweight of the whole superior body of water; and therefore, though the\r\nmotion be very slow, it will still possess great power.\r\n\r\nAny irregularities in the bed of the ocean beneath such a current must\r\nbe subject to very rapid abrasion. We shall sea hereafter, that\r\nearthquake vibrations often shiver the rocks at the solid surface; and\r\nif any of these ridges at the bottom of the ocean were thus acted upon,\r\nthe loosened portions would be swept away by the current and deposited\r\nat lower levels, or where the current subsides. If, in any instance\r\nduring an earthquake convulsion, a fault should be produced across one\r\nof these marine currents, like the great fault of over five hundred feet\r\nin England, the abutment thus thrown up would soon be worn down; and if\r\nit consisted of unconsolidated matter, it would be swept away almost\r\nbodily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of such currents will be greatest where they are deflected by\r\na continent or island. Thus, a marine current sets from near New Holland\r\nin a direct line to the north of the island of Madagascar, where it is\r\narrested by the African coast, and deflected into the narrow Mozambique\r\nchannel, and there acquires a velocity of four or five miles an hour. It\r\nis impossible that any kind of rock should receive the constant force of\r\nsuch a body of water without being rapidly worn away; and, if there\r\nshould be any difference of texture in this rocky barrier, the softer\r\nportions would yield the most rapidly, and thus valleys might be formed.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that the deep indentation on the western coast of\r\nAfrica may have been due, in a great measure, to the coast current from\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope; and that the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico\r\nmay have been excavated by the force of the Atlantic equatorial current\r\nbeing thrown into this angle.\r\n\r\nWe may regard these currents as oceanic rivers; and it is obvious that\r\nthe volume of the terrestrial rivers would bear no comparison with that\r\nof these currents, and their effects would be equally small in the\r\ncomparison. The Gulf Stream, and the Mozambique and other similar\r\ncurrents, must be wearing down the valleys through which they flow, to\r\nsuch an extent as to furnish an immense amount of detrital matter for\r\nthe formation of new rocks.\r\n\r\nIt is principally to the agency of these deep marine currents that we\r\nare to refer those extensive denudations, so abundant on the present\r\ncontinents, such as the wearing out of the intermediate masses of rock\r\nbetween the hills already referred to (Fig. 66), the denudation of the\r\nConnecticut river sandstone, and, perhaps, the excavations which have\r\nformed Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nII. _The Transportation of Sediment._\r\n\r\nThe detrital matter obtained in these several ways is swept away by\r\nrunning water. The specific gravity of rocks does not, in general,\r\nexceed two and a half. Hence, to keep them suspended in water, will\r\nrequire a force of only three-fifths of what would be necessary to\r\nsuspend them in the atmosphere. In the case of river currents, the\r\nvelocity and irregularity of motion are generally sufficient to keep all\r\nthe finer sediment equally distributed.\r\n\r\nThere will, however, be a division of the sediment according to the\r\nstrength of the current. Hence, the bed of a mountain stream, if there\r\nis any loose material, always consists of pebbles. As it approaches the\r\nalluvial region, the bed is sandy; and when the current becomes very\r\nsluggish, it consists of a fine mud.\r\n\r\nRivers never deposit all their sediment, some of them none of it, along\r\ntheir course. Large rivers continue partially distinct from the ocean\r\nwater to a considerable distance beyond their mouths. The waters of the\r\nAmazon have been recognized at a distance of three hundred miles. This\r\ndepends in part upon the volume and velocity of the river; more,\r\nhowever, upon the fact that river water is lighter than sea water. This\r\nextension of a river will, in most cases, be sufficient to deliver a\r\npart of its sediment into a marine current. When such a current sweeps\r\nvery near the mouth of a river, as it does to that of the Niger, the\r\nAmazon, or the Mississippi, it is probable that most of its sediment is\r\ncarried away by it.\r\n\r\nThe transporting power of a marine current is greater than that of a\r\nriver, in consequence of the greater specific gravity of its water; but\r\nit has scarcely any of that irregular motion of rapid rivers, upon which\r\ntheir transporting power in a great degree depends. The force of the\r\ncurrent alone, when it reaches the bottom, is, however, sufficient to\r\nremove every form of loose earthy matter. Thus it may be presumed that\r\nthe Gulf Stream sweeps all the sediment from its bed until it reaches\r\nthe latitude of Cape Hatteras, where the cold waters from the north\r\nbegin to underlie it, and it takes the character of a surface stream.\r\n\r\nBut the transporting power of marine currents depends mostly upon the\r\ndepth of water. It is found, by experiment, that ordinary river sediment\r\nwill sink in water about one foot in an hour. A current, therefore, of\r\na thousand feet in depth, which moves a mile in an hour, would carry its\r\nsediment a thousand miles. It is obvious, then, that there is no part of\r\nthe bed of the sea which may not be receiving sediment.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Deposition of Sediment._\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the weight of sediment, it follows that it\r\nwill be deposited whenever the water in which it is suspended is at\r\nrest. Hence, when a river increases in breadth so as to form a lake, the\r\nwaters at the outlet are seldom turbid. The earthy matters with which\r\nthe principal and tributary streams were charged all settle to the\r\nbottom, and go to lessen the capacity of the reservoir. Thus lakes are\r\ncontinually diminishing in depth and area. In many instances, they are\r\nalready filled with sediment, and are thus converted into alluvial\r\nplains, through which the river flows in a narrow channel.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently the case that a river, as it approaches the sea, has so\r\nslow a motion that its sediment is deposited on the bed of the stream.\r\nThus the bed will be raised, and the banks will also be raised, by the\r\ndeposition of sediment upon them at periods of overflow. The river will\r\nthen be raised above the adjacent country. The river Po, for the last\r\npart of its course, is from ten to twenty feet above the adjacent lands.\r\nThe same is true of the Mississippi, and many other rivers. The streets\r\nof New Orleans are several feet below the surface of the river. In an\r\nuninhabited country, such a river would soon seek a new and lower\r\nchannel; but in a populous country, it becomes a matter of interest and\r\nsafety to confine the river in its old channel, by artificial\r\nembankments.\r\n\r\nBut the principal part of the sediment of rivers is conveyed to the sea.\r\nIt here mingles with the debris which the waves have furnished, and a\r\npart of it is deposited to form deltas. The remaining part is taken up\r\nby marine currents, mingled with the debris which they have furnished,\r\nand is spread out on the bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\nOf the extent of these deposits we can form no estimate. Those of rivers\r\nand lakes are comparatively unimportant, as they are in the older\r\nformations. Some of the delta deposits are already of great extent. That\r\nof the Ganges contains an area of twenty-six thousand square miles, that\r\nof the Niger twenty-five thousand, and that of the Nile twelve thousand.\r\nThe delta of the Rhone has increased its area by three hundred square\r\nmiles in the last thousand years. The Po has encroached upon the\r\nAdriatic two thousand square miles in the last two thousand years, and\r\nthe Mississippi has enlarged its delta by one hundred square miles in\r\nthe last hundred years. In the deep valleys of the ocean accumulations\r\nmay be taking place on as large a scale as they ever have been in former\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIV. _Character of the Formations thus produced._\r\n\r\nSedimentary matter thus deposited would take the form of _strata_. Thus,\r\na delta deposit may receive at one time from a river a layer of coarse\r\ngravel and pebbles, and in the course of a few hours the current may be\r\nso reduced that it will convey to the same place only fine sand and\r\nsilt. Or, if a depositing current receive its sediment only at\r\nintervals, the heaviest particles would be thrown down first, and the\r\nmore finely levigated particles would continue to fall, till the water\r\nbecame transparent. Another supply would furnish another similar\r\nstratum, and so on. The same arrangement might result from the sediment\r\nbeing furnished by different rivers. Thus, if sediment were furnished to\r\nthe Gulf Stream by the Merrimac river, and the streams emptying into the\r\nBay of Fundy, the freshets would occur earlier in the season in the\r\nMerrimac, and it would furnish a supply of sediment from a region of\r\nprimary rocks. A later supply would come from the red sandstone region\r\nof Nova Scotia, and the stratification would be indicated by the\r\ndifferent kinds of rock produced. Thus stratification will result from\r\ndifference in the color, composition, or size of the particles of which\r\nrocks consist. A great variety of causes, both general and local, may\r\ntherefore give to a deposit this character. Hence, as stratified rocks\r\nare produced by the sediment now laid down from water, we may conclude\r\nthat the older stratified rocks are the sediment deposited in like\r\nmanner, in former times.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of layers of different composition, as one way in which\r\nthe stratification is indicated, is produced by local and frequently\r\nrecurring causes. There are, however, other alternations of much greater\r\nextent; those, for example, nearly twenty in number, distinguished by\r\nstriking differences in lithological character, into which the New York\r\nsystem of rocks is divided. These alternations have resulted from more\r\ngeneral causes. The physical geography of a wide region must have been\r\nso different, at the different periods during which these several\r\nformations were deposited, as to change, at each period, the kind of\r\nsediment furnished to the forming currents, and modify the types of\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the same causes that determined the stratified\r\narrangement will determine the alternations of strata of coarse and fine\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the stratification of the marine deposits will be\r\nnearly horizontal. If the surface were very irregular upon which the\r\ndeposition commenced, the irregularity would constantly diminish; for\r\nthe movement of the water over this surface, however slow, would tend to\r\nremove the accumulations from the highest points, and leave them at the\r\nlowest (Fig. 75). Delta and lake deposits will, however, dip somewhat,\r\nthough never at a high angle, towards the deep water. In certain\r\nsituations, where a river and a tidal wave, coming in conflict, cause,\r\nin succession, eddies and currents in opposite directions, we should\r\nexpect to find the stratification very irregular (Fig. 76); sometimes\r\nfalse stratifications (_a b_), sometimes the strata cut off abruptly,\r\nand at other times contorted or dipping in opposite directions within\r\nshort distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.]\r\n\r\nWherever sediment is deposited, it will entomb whatever of the remains\r\nof animal or vegetable life may be mingled with it. They will be at once\r\nprotected against the influence of all the ordinary decomposing\r\nagencies, and will continue for ages to retain their peculiar markings,\r\nand even their colors. They will thus constitute, in all future time, a\r\nrecord of the present condition of the organic world. The lacustrine\r\ndeposits can contain only fresh-water species of animals, marine\r\ndeposits only marine animals, while deltas may contain the remains of\r\nmarine life mingled with those which have been washed down by rivers.\r\nThe remains of birds, insects, and terrestrial animals, may occasionally\r\noccur, in every kind of deposit. Sediment deposited in deep water will\r\nnever contain fossils in abundance, the deep parts of the ocean being\r\nalmost wholly destitute of animal or vegetable life. It is only in water\r\nof a few fathoms that the greater number of species and of individuals\r\noccur. In all these particulars the deposits now forming sustain a close\r\nresemblance to the older formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\nThere are certain formations, as that of the coal, which required\r\nconditions for their formation different from those of ordinary\r\nsedimentary deposits. Coal consists of mineralized vegetable matter. Its\r\nvegetable origin is proved by the uniform occurrence of vegetable\r\nfossils almost exclusively in the coal measures. When reduced to thin\r\nslices and examined under a high magnifying power, a structure very\r\nsimilar to the ligneous tissue of existing coniferæ is sometimes found\r\nto exist. There are probably vegetable deposits now taking place not\r\naltogether unlike those which produced the coal measures.\r\n\r\nWe know that many rivers--the Mississippi, for example--now carry into\r\nthe sea great quantities of ligneous matter. Before the country was\r\ninhabited by man, the quantity was undoubtedly much greater than it now\r\nis. It floats for a time; but the ligneous tissue itself is heavier than\r\nwater, and as soon as the air is excluded from the pores, and they are\r\nfilled with water, it will sink. The woody and earthy matters are swept\r\ninto the sea together; but, as they sink under different circumstances,\r\nthey will be deposited separately. _Thus wood may continue to accumulate\r\nin particular places in the sea_ for long periods, with but little\r\nintermixture of earthy substances.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to be expected that, in the progress of geological\r\nchanges, the places which at one time receive deposits of wood will at\r\nanother receive detrital matter, and thus _the wood will become deeply\r\nburied_ beneath sedimentary strata.\r\n\r\nWood thus situated will become converted into coal. Trees which had been\r\ncovered to considerable depth with earth have been found near the\r\nMississippi river changed to lignite, a substance resembling charcoal.\r\nIn this case, the wood had been exposed to no greater heat than is\r\ncommon to the crust of the earth at the depth where it was found; and\r\nyet it had undergone this change since the country has been known to\r\nEuropeans, as it retained the marks of the axe when it was discovered.\r\nIt has also been found by experiment that vegetable matter, by long\r\nsubmersion in water, passes into the state of lignite. This is the first\r\nstep in the conversion of wood into mineral coal.\r\n\r\nWhen lignite is exposed to moderate heat and great pressure, it loses\r\nthe characters of lignite, and becomes mineral coal. This is shown by\r\nfacts observed in Germany, Ireland and Iceland, where beds of lignite\r\nhave been overspread by basalt. The upper portions of the lignite are\r\nchanged to mineral coal. The lower portions, which the heat did not\r\nreach, retain the characters of lignite.\r\n\r\nBeds of vegetable matter, with a great thickness of rock deposited above\r\nthem, would therefore be subject to all the conditions necessary to\r\nconvert them into coal, namely, pressure from the superincumbent mass,\r\nand the heat which the strata uniformly assume at great depths.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, therefore, that coal-beds are now forming, and\r\nthat they have been formed at every geological period since an abundant\r\nterrestrial vegetation commenced. Accordingly, there occurs in Virginia\r\nan extensive coal-field in the oölite formation. Coal-fields also occur\r\nin England, of less extent, in the same formation. In France, and other\r\nparts of Europe, there are extensive beds of lignite in the tertiary\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore no difficulty in accounting, in a general way, for the\r\nformations of the carboniferous period. The vegetables were probably\r\nless woody than those of the present time of equal size, and were\r\ntherefore more easily prostrated and committed to the waters. They grew\r\nrapidly in moist ground, and perhaps in shoal-water, and required an\r\natmosphere charged with moisture and of a high temperature. Thus much is\r\ninferred from the conditions most favorable for the growth of recent\r\nspecies analogous to the coal-plants. These recent species are tropical\r\nplants, and grow in moist insular situations, conditions which would\r\nhave existed at the carboniferous period, if the present coal-fields\r\nwere then an archipelago dotted with low islands.\r\n\r\nSuch being regarded as the origin of the coal-beds, the _alternations_\r\nof the earthy and carbonaceous strata may be referred, provisionally, to\r\nthose great changes in physical geography upon which the other\r\nalternations of strata on a large scale depend. But the regularity with\r\nwhich the coal-seams and sandstone succeed each other presents some\r\ndifficulties which, in the present state of knowledge, we cannot\r\nsatisfactorily account for.\r\n\r\n_Beds of salt_ occur, interstratified with other rocks, in nearly all\r\ncountries. Still, it is not a sedimentary deposit, and its formation\r\nmust depend upon peculiar circumstances. In New York, saline, together\r\nwith earthy matter, constitutes the Onondaga limestone, one of the\r\nformations of the New York system. In Kentucky, the strata of rock-salt\r\nare in the coal formation; in England, they are in the new red\r\nsandstone; in Spain, they are in the greensand, and in Poland they are\r\nin tertiary strata. The conditions of its formation have therefore\r\nexisted in connection with the deposition of every fossiliferous rock.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the ocean is the principal reservoir of the\r\nsaline matters which are taken up whenever water percolates through\r\nrocks. It must happen not unfrequently, in the course of submarine\r\nelevations, that a basin of sea-water will be cut off from its\r\ncommunication with the sea; and from this basin the evaporation might be\r\nmore rapid than the supply of water. The great salt-lake of Utah is\r\nundoubtedly a basin of this kind. The Mediterranean Sea is another such\r\nbasin, not yet wholly separated from the ocean. The evaporation exceeds\r\nthe supply of water from the rivers, and a powerful stream is therefore\r\ncontinually thrown in from the ocean, through the Strait of Gibraltar.\r\nThe waters of the Mediterranean are already more highly charged with\r\nsalt than ordinary sea-water. This sea may ultimately become a saturated\r\nsolution, and begin to deposit salt. But whether it does, or not, it\r\nindicates the way in which salt-beds may be formed.\r\n\r\nV. _Solidification of Aqueous Deposits._\r\n\r\nSediment is generally deposited as a soft mud, but in nearly all the\r\nolder formations it has become solidified. When rocks are deposited from\r\na chemical solution, they take at once the solid form. Such is the case\r\nwith rock-salt and with limestone, when the material has been held in\r\nsolution. Solidification takes place in nearly the same way when water\r\nwhich holds carbonate of lime or oxide of iron in solution filters\r\nthrough beds of sand or gravel. The substance held in solution is\r\ndeposited in the interstices till they become filled, and the whole is\r\nchanged to solid rock.\r\n\r\nSome rocks are composed of such materials that they _set_, like\r\nhydraulic cement, when they are deposited. Other rocks become solid\r\nsimply by drying. Thus a deposit now forming in Lake Superior becomes,\r\nby drying, nearly as hard as granite. Such a deposit will therefore\r\nbecome solid whenever it shall be elevated above the water.\r\n\r\nThe pressure to which all but the upper layers are subjected is probably\r\nsufficient to reduce most rocks to the solid state. Dry and pulverized\r\nclay is reduced by artificial pressure, for a moment, almost to stone.\r\nThe pressure upon the deep-seated rocks is constant, and greater than\r\nany artificial pressure can be.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these causes, all the older rocks have been subjected to\r\na high temperature, some of them nearly to that of fusion. By this means\r\nthe solidification of every kind of rock would be promoted, and probably\r\nsome may have been reduced by it to the solid state, which would\r\notherwise have remained as an incoherent mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.--AQUEO-GLACIAL ACTION.\r\n\r\n1. _Glaciers._--A glacier is a mass of ice occupying the bed of a\r\nmountain valley, having a slow progressive motion, and reaching somewhat\r\nlower in the valley than the line of constant snow. (Fig. 77.) The\r\nGlacier des Bois, which may be regarded as a specimen of the Alpine\r\nglaciers, covers an area of about seventeen square miles. In its\r\nlowest portion, when all its branches have become united into one\r\nstream, it has an average width of half a mile, and is five miles long.\r\nIt is estimated that the glaciers of the Alps cover an area of fourteen\r\nhundred square miles. These have been the most carefully studied, though\r\nglaciers are found in the valleys of various other ranges of mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the higher valleys, the snow, which falls at all seasons of the year,\r\naccumulates in immense quantities, and the steep mountain sides\r\ncontribute, by frequent avalanches, to this accumulation. The snow, when\r\nthus increased, does not become a compact, adhesive mass; but, changing\r\ninto particles of solid ice, it resembles sand rather than snow. It is\r\nthis _névé_ which constitutes the upper part of every _glacier_, and\r\nwhich, in a modified form, constitutes the lower part.\r\n\r\nThe valleys descend rapidly towards the base of the mountains; and this\r\nsnow-ice, having no cohesion between its particles, _moves slowly down\r\nthe slope of the valley_, like a very imperfect liquid. After descending\r\nbelow the line of perpetual snow, the surface will melt during the day;\r\nand the water, sinking into the porous mass, becomes frozen, and\r\nconverts the whole into more or less compact ice, yet never into a rigid\r\nmass. Influenced by its own weight, and by the pressure of the snow-ice\r\nbehind, it still continues its motion, and conforms itself to the shape\r\nand curves of the valley through which it passes. The average movement\r\nper annum may be stated at about five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the rocky bed of the valley will be a little, and but\r\na little, higher than thirty-two degrees. There will therefore be but\r\nlittle melting at the bed of this river of ice. As it receives continual\r\naccessions from the atmosphere, it will therefore increase in volume\r\ntill it descends to the level of perpetual snow. Below this line _the\r\nwaste exceeds the addition_; and as it approaches the lower and\r\ncultivated portions of the valley, it rapidly diminishes, till it\r\nfinally loses the solid form, and becomes a rivulet. The terminus of the\r\nglacier is determined principally by the general climate of the country.\r\nAny considerable variation of climate will cause it to recede, or\r\ndescend lower down the valley. The terminus varies, however, somewhat\r\nwith the seasons, being lower in winter than in summer, though the\r\nmotion is much less in the cold season than in the warm; and it descends\r\nmany rods further some seasons than it does others.\r\n\r\nThe glacier consists principally of snow, more or less modified in\r\nstructure; but it also contains whatever else may have been thrown upon\r\nits surface, or into the snows by which it is fed. Tributary glaciers\r\nextend up through all the gorges into which the irregular surface of the\r\nmountain-top is divided. On these rough peaks there are always fragments\r\nof rock, varying in size from fine sand to masses weighing many tons;\r\nsome of them loosened when the mountain was upheaved, some by subsequent\r\nearthquake vibrations, and others still by tempests, lightnings, and\r\nchanges of temperature. When the snow has accumulated to a certain\r\nextent on the steep slopes, it falls in avalanches into the valleys,\r\ncarrying with it loosened masses of rock, and often breaking off large\r\nfragments from the rocky escarpments against which it strikes. These\r\navalanches are almost constantly descending, and hence a glacier always\r\ncontains considerable _earthy matter distributed through it_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe friction of the glacier, at its edges and along its bed, separates\r\nmore or less of the rock over which it moves; and hence there is always\r\na layer of mud and pebbles under the glacier, and a line of loose\r\nfragments, called a _lateral moraine_, at the sides. When two glaciers\r\nunite, the two lateral moraines, thus brought together, come to the\r\nsurface, forming a medial moraine, and show the line of junction\r\nsometimes for miles.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the glacier on the bed of rock, assisted by the layer of\r\npebbles, will wear down the prominent portions, and everywhere polish\r\nthe surface. Fragments of rocks may be frozen into the glacier at all\r\ndepths. Those which lie near the lower surface of the glacier would, by\r\nslight melting of that surface, project downward so as to act as a\r\ngraver's tool on the rock over which it passes. Hence, when the\r\nextremity of the glacier has receded beyond its ordinary limit, the\r\nsurface of rock exposed is found, upon examination, to be _polished_,\r\n_striated_, and _occasionally grooved_ an inch or two deep.\r\n\r\nSince the waste is almost wholly superficial, earthy matter, which was\r\nat first concealed in the mass of the glacier, is continually coming to\r\nview, as the surface melts and runs off. Thus, none of the freight of\r\nthe glacier is left along its course, but all is carried to its terminus\r\nand discharged there. Hence, at the lower extremity of the glacier there\r\nis always an embankment of earth, pebbles, and boulders. If the glacier\r\nrecedes a few yards at one season of the year, and leaves its earthy\r\nfragments scattered over this surface, they will be pushed forward into\r\na ridge, as the glacier again advances. This ridge is called a _terminal\r\nmoraine_, and consists wholly of substances which have been separated\r\nfrom the mountain mass, often at the highest beginnings of the glacier.\r\nAt the terminus of all the Alpine glaciers, there is a series of these\r\nmoraines (_a a a_, Fig. 77) marking the successive limits of the glacier\r\nin former times.\r\n\r\nThere is a ridge of boulders on the north side of the Swiss valley, near\r\nthe base of the Jura Mountains, resembling a terminal moraine. These\r\nboulders consist of several groups, distinguished by peculiarities of\r\nstructure and composition; and each group lies opposite to the\r\nparticular Alpine valley which now furnishes the same kind of\r\nfragments. It has been thought that, at a former period of more severe\r\nclimate, the Swiss valley was filled in part with ice, and that the\r\npresent glaciers extended across it to the Jura Mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the polished and striated surfaces of the rocks in the\r\nAlpine valleys are precisely like the surface of the rock, which has not\r\nbeen exposed to atmospheric influences, in the north of Europe and\r\nAmerica. It has been proposed to extend the glacier theory, and account\r\nfor these phenomena by supposing that the north polar regions were, at\r\nthe ice period, capped with a glacier-mass, extending as far south as\r\nthe drift phenomena appear.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be doubted that the phenomena of polished surfaces and\r\ntransported materials in the immediate vicinity of the Alps, and near\r\nother high mountains, are correctly referred to glacial action. This\r\ntheory has therefore solved, in part, one of the most difficult problems\r\nin geology; but there is great difficulty in extending it so as to\r\naccount for the drift phenomena in general. If the motion depends upon\r\ngravitation only, the origin must have a much greater elevation than the\r\nterminus, which would not be the case in the great glacier supposed to\r\nextend southward from the Arctic regions. Elevation of temperature, it\r\nhas been thought, might account for the movement of the mass southward.\r\n\r\n2. _Icebergs._--In very high latitudes, the ice, which makes out from\r\nthe land into the sea during the cold season, suffers but little waste\r\nat any time. This sheet of ice continues to increase in breadth and\r\nthickness, by congelation, from year to year. The spray and the snows of\r\neach succeeding year will also add to the mass. It thus accumulates to\r\nthe height of several hundred yards. It will also reach down a good many\r\nfeet below the surface of the sea, and will extend back on the land, or\r\nlie heaped up against a precipitous escarpment, and firmly frozen to it.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain amount of extension over the sea, the accumulated weight\r\nof the ice and snow would tend to depress it, and break it loose from\r\nthe shore. The waves would tend to the same result, and would act at\r\ngreater mechanical advantage, as its extension from the shore becomes\r\ngreater. _Hence, it would ultimately become separated from the shore_,\r\nand float in the water.\r\n\r\nAt its commencement, the earth, pebbles and rocks, which may lie along\r\nthe shore, and as far down into the sea as the congelation extends, are\r\nfrozen into it. In many situations its mass would be increased by\r\navalanches while it remained attached to the land, and these would\r\nsupply also masses of earth and rocks, as they do to glaciers. When it\r\nbecomes loosened from the shore, it will break off, and carry with it\r\nsome of the earthy portions of the coast, or the less firmly fixed\r\nmasses of rock from the escarpment against which it formed. Thus every\r\niceberg becomes _freighted_, more or less, _with earth and rocks_. This\r\nhas almost uniformly been found to be the case, when they have been\r\nlanded upon by ships' crews and examined.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the general tendency of the waters of the ocean, and\r\nof the lower stratum of the atmosphere, is to a motion from the poles\r\ntowards the equator. However irregular, therefore, the course of an\r\niceberg may be, its general _movement_, influenced both by the\r\nprevailing winds and by ocean currents, will be _towards the equator_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\nThese floating ice-mountains (Fig. 78) are formed in _great numbers, and\r\nof vast size_. The relative specific gravity of ice and water are such\r\nthat nine cubic feet of ice, below the surface of water, will support\r\none cubic foot above it. As icebergs are often one or two hundred feet\r\nhigh, their vertical depth must be a thousand feet at least; and their\r\narea is equal to a square mile, and sometimes it is much greater. In\r\n1840, the United States Exploring Expedition, in the extreme southern\r\nocean, coasted for eighty miles along a single iceberg. They are never\r\nabsent from the polar seas; and at certain seasons they are so abundant\r\nalong the usual course of vessels from New York to Liverpool, as greatly\r\nto obstruct and endanger navigation.\r\n\r\nAn iceberg may continue for some time to increase in size, while\r\nfloating in the polar seas, but will at length reach a latitude where\r\nthe waste will exceed the additions, in consequence of the temperature\r\nboth of the air and of the water. It will, therefore, drop gradually the\r\nearthy matters which it contains, upon the bed of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that icebergs may often reach down so far as to\r\nstrike the highest points of the bed of the sea. The ice would be\r\nlifted, and glide over the elevation, without suffering any perceptible\r\ndeviation from its general course. It would thus affect the surface of\r\nrocks exactly like a glacier. If, however, the iceberg becomes\r\npermanently stranded, and melts in one place, its earthy matters will be\r\nthrown down upon the elevation which first arrested it.\r\n\r\nIf the bed of the sea, between the fortieth and sixtieth degrees of\r\nlatitude, could be exposed for examination, the rocky surface would be\r\nfound to be polished and striated by the icebergs which have passed over\r\nit, and the whole surface would be strewed with boulders and drifted\r\nmaterials brought from Arctic and Antarctic lands. Sometimes it would be\r\naccumulated in heaps, and sometimes spread nearly over the surface.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that very recently, probably about the close of the\r\ntertiary period, the portion of Europe and America over which the\r\nnorthern drift is found, has been depressed several hundred feet. It may\r\nbe presumed that at that time icebergs floated over it, polished the\r\nsurface of the rocks, and distributed the boulders and other drift which\r\nis now found upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--IGNEOUS CAUSES.\r\n\r\nI. _Of the Temperature of the Mass of the Earth._--Heat has been the\r\nmost efficient agent in determining and modifying the structure of the\r\nearth; and, in order that the explanations of the phenomena referable to\r\nthis cause may be intelligible, some idea must be formed of the actual\r\npresent condition of the mass of the earth with respect to heat.\r\n\r\nAt any point of the surface there are variations of temperature,\r\ndepending on external causes. But these variations are found to extend\r\nonly a little way below the surface,--never more than a hundred feet. At\r\ngreater depths, it is found that the temperature invariably increases\r\nwith the depth. Deep mines have always a temperature above the mean\r\nannual temperature at the surface. The water obtained by deep boring is\r\nalways tepid when it comes to the surface. The thermal springs, so\r\nabundant in this country and in Europe, are so situated as to justify\r\nthe impression that their waters come from great depths. To make these\r\ngeneral observations of any value, we must determine the law by which\r\nthe temperature increases. The result of all the observations yet made,\r\nin mines and upon wells and springs, is that, below the first hundred\r\nfeet, the temperature increases by one degree of Fahrenheit's scale for\r\nevery forty-five feet.\r\n\r\nRegarding this law of increment as applicable to all depths, at ten\r\nmiles below the surface we should have a temperature above that produced\r\nby the combustion of wood; and at twenty-five miles, a temperature of\r\nthree thousand degrees, by which nearly all mineral substances would be\r\nreduced to a state of fusion.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion of a temperature sufficient to melt the mineral\r\nsubstances of which rocks are composed, at no considerable distance\r\nbelow the surface, is confirmed by the fact that portions of the\r\ninterior of the earth--at least, at the volcanic centres--are in a\r\nmelted state. The intimate connection between some volcanoes situated a\r\nhundred miles or more apart, so that they are alternately in a state of\r\nactivity and rest, indicates that these centres are connected,--that\r\nsubterranean melted lava extends from one to the other, so that when one\r\nis active, the elastic force is relieved at the other. These deep-seated\r\nlakes of lava must therefore underlie large areas.\r\n\r\nWe are justified, then, in concluding that the mass of the earth, with\r\nthe exception of a comparatively thin superficial layer, has a very high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nBy way of accounting for this temperature, it is now generally assumed\r\nthat the earth was originally in a state of fusion; that it was a mass\r\nof liquid lava (if, indeed, it had not a temperature sufficient to\r\nreduce it to the aëriform state). Starting with this assumption, there\r\nmust necessarily be a gradual reduction of temperature by radiation, and\r\na time must arrive when the surface would be crusted over with\r\nsolidified lava; and this crust would increase in thickness as the\r\ncooling advanced, the interior still retaining its heat and liquidity.\r\nThe present condition of the crust of the earth, its form, that of an\r\noblate spheroid, with the exact difference of the equatorial and polar\r\ndiameters which is found to exist, as well as the phenomena of volcanic\r\neruptions, will all admit of explanation on this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been rejected by some; and, to account for the heat of\r\nthe interior of the earth, it is suggested that, if the bases of the\r\nearths and alkalies, particularly potassium, sodium and calcium, exist\r\nin their metallic state beneath the surface, the rapid oxidation of them\r\nby the access of water would generate heat of sufficient intensity to\r\nmelt the oxidized materials, and thus account for the phenomena\r\nattributable to heat.\r\n\r\nEither of these hypotheses may be adopted; but it is not necessary to\r\naccount at all for the existence of this temperature. The fact is\r\nsusceptible of proof; and, though we may not be able to frame any\r\nhypothesis to account for its existence, we may yet employ the fact in\r\nthe explanation of other phenomena.\r\n\r\nII. _The Action of Internal Heat in producing Volcanoes._\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes are evidently produced by\r\nsome force operating from below. The effect of heat alone would be to\r\nreduce the rock to a liquid state. There is no reason to suppose that it\r\nis ever sufficient to reduce them to the aëriform state. The elastic\r\nforce must therefore depend upon some other substance associated with\r\nthe lava, and this substance is water.\r\n\r\nThis will be shown by an examination of lavas. At the time of their\r\nejection, they are in a fluid or semi-fluid state; but it is not a\r\ncomplete fusion. Even the most fluid lavas contain particles of minerals\r\nin a solid state. The liquidity depends upon the fusion of the more\r\nfusible portions, and upon the steam of water at a high temperature,\r\nwhich fills the interstices between the solid particles. The porous\r\ncharacter of cooled lavas is produced by the steam which filled the\r\ncavities previous to solidification. Steam always escapes from the\r\nsurface of a lava current while it is cooling, and it is always\r\ndischarged in immense volumes from the orifice of eruption, in\r\nconnection with the lava, and especially at the close of an eruption.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of volcanoes, also, leads to the conclusion\r\nthat water is essential to their activity. There are five principal\r\nlines of volcanic activity. One, commencing at the southern extremity of\r\nSouth America, extends northward along the Andes and Cordilleras to\r\nCalifornia or Oregon. The second has a north-east and south-west\r\ndirection, from the Aleutian Islands through the Kurule, Japanese, and\r\nPhilippine islands, till it meets the third line, lying in a nearly east\r\nand west direction, embracing Sumatra, Java, and most of the Pacific\r\nvolcanic islands. A fourth band commences in the Grecian islands, and\r\nextends westward so as to include the volcanoes of Italy and the\r\nadjacent islands, and the Azores. The fifth band embraces the volcanic\r\nislands of the West Indies, crosses Mexico in about the latitude of the\r\ncity of Mexico, and extends into the Pacific. There are also some\r\nisolated centres of volcanic activity, such as Iceland. These volcanic\r\nbands embrace about three hundred volcanoes. It will be seen that they\r\nmust nearly all be in close proximity to the ocean, or to large seas.\r\nAbout two-thirds of them are on islands. Moreover, the volcanic vents\r\nwhich are wholly submarine are probably very numerous.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance of the position of volcanoes establishes a presumption\r\nthat they cannot exist at a distance from some large body of water; and,\r\ntaking it in connection with the constant presence of aqueous vapor in\r\nlava, we are justified in the conclusion that _the presence of water is\r\nan essential condition of volcanic activity_.\r\n\r\nKnowing that heat and water exist at the volcanic centres, it is not\r\ndifficult to form an idea of _their mode of operation_. The water,\r\ndiffused through the interstices of the lava, and subjected to a\r\ntemperature sufficient to melt the lava, would possess an _elastic\r\npower_, which, though never computed, we may well suppose capable of\r\novercoming any resistance which the crust of the earth might present.\r\nThe repressing force will be the tenacity and weight of the\r\nsuperincumbent strata. Whenever the elasticity is superior to this\r\nrepressing force, it will manifest itself in the fracture of the strata,\r\nand often in the ejection or lava to the surface.\r\n\r\nThis fracturing of the strata, produced by an uplifting subterranean\r\nforce, is believed to be the cause of the noise and the vibratory motion\r\nwhich are the chief phenomena of earthquakes. The elastic force may\r\nraise lava to the surface, and thus the fracture would become a volcano.\r\nBut the force may expend itself by the discharge of vapor into the\r\nfissure, or by merely filling it with lava. In either case, the only\r\nevidence of the existence of the volcanic force would be the noise and\r\nthe wave-like motion experienced at the surface. The cause of the\r\nvolcano and earthquake is therefore the same, though the phenomena which\r\ncharacterize them are different.\r\n\r\nWhen the strata are is thus fractured, lava may for a time be discharged\r\nalong the whole line. By the cooling of lava in the fracture, it would\r\nbecome partially reunited. Still, this would be the line of least\r\nresistance. It would therefore be again burst through in certain places,\r\nwhich would long continue to be orifices of discharge, and thus the\r\noriginal fracture would determine _a line of volcanic activity_.\r\n\r\nThe repressing force may become greater at an orifice of eruption than\r\nat some other point, either by the great accumulation of ejected\r\nmaterials around the opening, or by the dormancy of the volcano long\r\nenough for the complete solidification of the lava with which the\r\nchannel was filled. The least resistance may then be far from any\r\nprevious vent, when a new orifice of discharge will be opened, and _a\r\nnew volcano make its appearance_. It seems probable, also, that\r\nvolcanoes may become extinct by the reduction of temperature at the\r\nvolcanic centre, and that new volcanic centres may be formed; but the\r\ncause of this change of temperature is not yet well understood. New\r\nvolcanoes have broken out in the sea, near Iceland, in several\r\ninstances; others in the volcanic line east of Asia. Graham Island,\r\nsituated between Sicily and Africa, was formed by an eruption which\r\nbroke out in the bed of the sea where the soundings were more than one\r\nhundred fathoms. The island was at one time two hundred feet 'above the\r\nsea, and three miles in circumference. It was, however, gradually\r\ndestroyed by the action of the waves, and now remains a dangerous reef,\r\ncovered by less than two fathoms water. The volcano of Jorullo, in\r\nMexico, was formed in this way. Previous to the formation of the\r\nmountain, the region where it now is was a cultivated table-land. During\r\nthe year 1759 volcanic action commenced and continued, until, at the\r\nexpiration of twelve months, a cone had been formed having an elevation\r\nof sixteen hundred feet above the adjacent plain.\r\n\r\nAn orifice of eruption is at first but little elevated above the general\r\nsurface; but, by the accumulation of ejected matter, a cone is at length\r\nformed around the vent. The upper portion of a cone always consists of\r\nthese materials, but there may also be in progress a general elevation\r\nof that part of the earth's crust, and the cone will partake of that\r\ngeneral elevation. The cones of the Andes owe their height, in a great\r\nmeasure, to a general movement of elevation; those of Ætna and\r\nVesuvius, in a greater degree, to accumulation of ejected matter.\r\n\r\nIn either way, the height may become so great that the force necessary\r\nto raise a column of lava to the top would be greater than the sides of\r\nthe cone, weakened as they always are by fractures in all directions,\r\ncan sustain. Hence, the highest craters of Ætna and South America have\r\nlong been closed, and the lava escapes through fissures at a lower\r\nlevel, and _lateral cones_ are produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.]\r\n\r\nThe form which the materials have, when ejected from volcanoes, depends\r\nmainly upon the degree of liquidity of the lavas at the volcanic foci.\r\nIf the liquidity is very perfect, the aqueous vapor will readily rise\r\nthrough the lava. The steam thus separated will drive before it whatever\r\nrocks, or previous lavas, may obstruct it. In their progress they would\r\nbe reduced to sand and powder, and ejected as _volcanic cinders_. (Fig.\r\n79.) If the lava possess considerable viscidity, the aqueous vapor will\r\nseparate with more difficulty, and the lava and vapor will ascend the\r\nchannel together. Large bubbles of vapor will, however, collect with\r\nmore or less of frequency; and, as they rise through the lava, will\r\ndrive forward a portion of it, and cause the overflow to take place by\r\npulsations. As the bubbles reach the surface, their bursting causes the\r\nloud reports, which are compared to the discharge of heavy artillery.\r\nWith each explosion some of the lava will be projected violently into\r\nthe air, and, cooling, will fall to the surface as scoriæ,--or, if the\r\nlava be highly vitreous, it will be drawn out into fibres, and descend\r\nas volcanic glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Geological Phenomena referable to Volcanic Action._\r\n\r\nVolcanic agency has probably never been less than it is now, and we\r\nought therefore to find its effects very general and important.\r\n\r\n1. The most obvious of these effects are the _fractures_ with which the\r\ncrust of the earth is everywhere intersected. The uplifting force upon\r\nwhich all volcanic phenomena depend would necessarily fracture the\r\ncrust, and the wave-like motion resulting from the fracture would cause\r\nnumerous secondary fractures, having a parallel direction. They are\r\noften of such extent, during earthquakes, as to endanger life. During\r\nthe great earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755, a fracture opened of sufficient\r\nwidth to swallow up the quay, and several thousands of persons who had\r\nfled there for safety. The chasm remained permanently open to the depth\r\nof six hundred feet. The earthquakes with which the valley of the\r\nMississippi was visited in 1811 so often fissured the surface, that the\r\ninhabitants protected themselves by clinging to the trunks of trees,\r\nwhich they felled transversely to the direction of the fissures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.]\r\n\r\nThe first fracture which is produced by the upheaving force will open\r\nupwards, and scarcely reach down to the seat of the force. But there\r\nwill be other parallel fractures, dependent upon the first, and opening\r\ndownward. Thus, the primary fracture at _a_ (Fig. 80) will be at once\r\nfollowed by the fracture _b_, opening toward the lava, which will be\r\ninjected into it, and which, on cooling, will form a _dike_. Their\r\nformation is mostly concealed from observation, but not always. During\r\nthe eruption of Ætna, in 1669, numerous fissures opened, one of which\r\nwas six feet wide and twelve miles in length; and the light emitted from\r\nit indicated that it was filled with lava to near the surface. The\r\nprocess was as perfectly seen as from the nature of the case it could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n2. The conversion of the lower sedimentary strata into _metamorphic\r\nrocks_ has been effected by volcanic heat. The material of which dikes\r\nconsist has been injected in a highly-heated state; and, by observing\r\nthe effect which they have had upon the adjacent rocks, we may judge of\r\nthe effect which subterranean heat must have upon the lower mechanical\r\nstrata. Wherever the dikes are of considerable thickness, they have\r\nconverted the adjacent shales into primary slate, the sandstones into\r\nquartz rock, and the dark and friable limestones into granular marble,\r\nand destroyed the organic impressions. In the southern extremity of\r\nNorway there is a district in which granite protrudes in a large mass\r\nthrough fossiliferous strata. These strata are invariably _altered_ to a\r\ndistance of from fifty to four hundred yards from the granite. The\r\nshales have become flinty, and resemble jasper; and near the granite\r\nthey contain hornblende. The siliceous matter of the shales has become\r\nquartz rock, which sometimes contains hornblende and mica, and therefore\r\nconstitutes a kind of granite. The limestone, which at points remote\r\nfrom the injected rock is an earthy, blue, coralline limestone, has\r\nbecome a white, granular marble, near the granite, and the corals are\r\nobliterated. The altered shales and limestones in many places contain\r\ngarnets, ores of iron, lead, &c. The annexed (Fig. 81) is a plan of this\r\ngranite and altered rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most instructive examples of metamorphic action in this\r\ncountry is found in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. These\r\nmountains have, till recently, been thought to consist principally of\r\ngranite; but it is now ascertained that this supposed granite is an\r\naltered rock of the silurian period. It is represented as \"intersected\r\nby veins of felspathic granite; and the general mass is itself in many\r\nparts converted into a near approximation to a binary granite, composed\r\nof distinctly developed quartz and white felspar, with a few sparsely\r\nscattered specks of mica. In its weathered surfaces it wears a close\r\nresemblance to some fine-grained granites; but, upon inspecting a fresh\r\nfracture with a magnifier, we instantly perceive many rounded grains of\r\nquartzose sand, and the felspar is imperfectly formed, though the mica\r\nhas more nearly reached the condition which it has in granite. In some\r\nof the coarse varieties of this white rock, small rounded pebbles of\r\nquartz are to be seen, giving unequivocal evidence, even to the naked\r\neye, of its being an altered sandstone. We feel no hesitation in\r\ndeciding it to have been a silico-argillaceous white sandstone, now\r\nalmost granitized by extensive metamorphic action.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar illustrations, on a small scale, may be seen in every country\r\nwhere the strata have been cut through by intrusive dikes. Sir James\r\nHall has shown the same by actual experiment. He exposed pulverized\r\nchalk to heat sufficient to melt it, and under sufficient pressure to\r\nprevent the escape of the carbonic acid. After cooling, the chalk was\r\nfound to have taken the form of crystallized limestone. But instances\r\nenough have been given to show what changes should be looked for\r\nwherever the sedimentary rocks have been exposed to a high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe lower strata must have been exposed, for long periods of time, to\r\nsuch a temperature. We do not know at what depth below the surface of\r\nthe earth the rocks become liquid; but above the line of actual fusion\r\nthere must be a mass of rock not melted, yet scarcely retaining the\r\nsolid form. For a great thickness, perhaps for several miles, it would\r\nbe in a more or less yielding state. As there is not actual fusion, the\r\nstratification is not destroyed, but such a degree of mobility among\r\nthe particles exists, that some degree of crystallization takes place,\r\nand the elastic forces below easily bend, throw into folds, compress,\r\nand in every way contort these strata. At the same time, any organic\r\nmatters which they may contain are decomposed, and the impressions of\r\nthem are obliterated. And such is the condition in which the metamorphic\r\nstrata are actually found.\r\n\r\n3. _Denudation_ is, in a great measure, dependent on volcanic action. It\r\nresults from the billowy motion peculiar to the earthquake. This is not\r\nsimply a violent horizontal motion, but an equally violent vertical one.\r\nIt is a series of waves,--a succession of alternate elevations and\r\ndepressions of the solid crust. The height of these waves can only be\r\njudged of by their effects; but it is difficult to account for some of\r\nthese effects, without supposing the waves to have been several yards in\r\nheight, and their velocity, in the few instances in which the time has\r\nbeen accurately determined, was twenty miles a minute.\r\n\r\nThat such earthquake waves actually exist there can be no doubt. During\r\nthe earthquake in Calabria, in 1783, the flagstones in many of the towns\r\nwere lifted from their places and thrown down inverted, and trees bent\r\nso that their tops touched the ground. During the great earthquake in\r\nChili, in 1835, the walls of houses, which were parallel to the line of\r\noscillation, were thrown down, while those that were at right angles to\r\nit, though greatly fractured, were often left standing. Wherever careful\r\nobservations have been made, during and after severe earthquakes,\r\nanalogous facts have been noticed. Persons are generally affected with\r\nsea-sickness. The sea is violently agitated. It often retires to an\r\nunusual distance, and then returns upon the shore with most destructive\r\nwaves. Incredible, therefore, as it may seem, that the solid crust of\r\nthe earth should be thrown into such wave-like undulations, the fact is\r\nwell established.\r\n\r\nWith a velocity of twenty miles an hour, the successive waves may be\r\nsome miles apart, and yet be sufficient to account for all the\r\nphenomena. It is evident, therefore, that the curvature of the wave\r\nwill be very slight, and yet enough to break into fragments all the\r\nrocks thus curved. During the earthquake in Chili, before referred to,\r\n\"the ground was fissured, in many parts, in north and south lines. Some\r\nof the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide. Many enormous masses\r\nhad fallen on the beach. The effect of the vibrations on the hard\r\nprimary slates was still more curious. The superficial parts of some\r\nnarrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had been blasted by\r\ngunpowder.\" Similar phenomena seem everywhere to be exhibited by\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that almost all parts of the earth have, at different\r\nperiods, been subject to these earthquake waves. Accordingly, we find\r\nthat the crust of the earth is nowhere in an entire state, but is\r\ndivided by irregular lines into comparatively small fragments. By this\r\nmeans, the deep fissures produced by fractures opening upwards would be\r\nfilled with fragments of rock shattered from the uplifted edges. In this\r\nway the boulder masses were originally loosened from their parent beds,\r\nand exposed to the action of ice, or any other transporting agencies. In\r\nthe same way the rocky bed of the ocean is, to a considerable depth,\r\nreduced to a disintegrated mass. In this condition it will be rapidly\r\nremoved by marine currents, more or less broken, worn and comminuted, by\r\nthe movement, and deposited elsewhere. The materials have thus been\r\nfurnished for a very large proportion of the sedimentary rocks, and\r\nespecially of those which are composed of distinct fragments of other\r\nrocks. By this means, also, wherever the rock formations come to the\r\nsurface, they are so broken that limestone, sandstone or granite,\r\nsuitable for architectural purposes, is seldom found, except at\r\nconsiderable depths. This fragmentary condition of the surface rock is\r\nsuch as exposes it to be acted upon readily by any powerfully abrading\r\ncauses, or to be more rapidly disintegrated by atmospheric and aqueous\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n4. We have already assumed that one principal division of rocks--the\r\nunstratified--is of igneous origin. We have the proof of actual\r\nobservation, that lavas, and the accompanying _tufas_ and _grits_, are\r\nvolcanic products. The peculiarities of these products, in situation,\r\nstructure, and form, and in the imbedded minerals, are so great, that\r\nwhenever we find these peculiarities in the rocks of a country not now\r\nvolcanic, we still regard these rocks as of volcanic origin. We thus\r\nhave lavas, as well as stratified rocks, of different ages. There has\r\nprobably been no time in the earth's history when they have not been\r\nforming.\r\n\r\nThe _trappean rocks_ are also of igneous origin. It is evident, from\r\ntheir occurring in the form of dikes, that they have been in a melted\r\nstate. As they rest upon rocks of a sedimentary origin, they must have\r\nbeen thrown up by volcanic forces. Yet they differ from ordinary lavas.\r\nThey are not vesicular in their structure, are more crystalline, and\r\nthere is in no case evidence that they have flowed from craters. If we\r\nregard them as the lavas of submarine volcanoes, we shall have\r\nconditions which will account for all their peculiarities. At a certain\r\ndepth the pressure of the water would be sufficient to prevent the\r\nformation and escape of vapor, and therefore the lavas thus ejected\r\nwould not be vesicular. As the rapid cooling of lavas depends, in a\r\ngreat degree, upon the escape of watery vapor, submarine lavas would\r\ncool slowly, in consequence of the pressure. The liquidity depending in\r\npart upon the retention of the heat, and in part upon the retention of\r\nthe aqueous vapor, they would consequently remain in a liquid state much\r\nlonger than the lavas of sub-aërial volcanoes. They would therefore take\r\na more highly crystalline form. All the loose materials thrown out\r\nduring the eruption would be removed by oceanic currents, and hence no\r\ncone would be built up around the orifice of eruption. We may therefore\r\nregard the trappean rocks as the lavas of submarine volcanoes. The\r\npresent volcanoes of this kind are necessarily producing the same kind\r\nof rocks, though there will be no other proof that they exist, except\r\nthe existence of the volcano, till the bed of the sea becomes dry land.\r\n\r\nThe _granitic rocks_ are also the product of igneous causes. Granite is\r\nthe most abundant of these crystalline rocks; and the others, such as\r\ncrystalline limestone, are so intimately associated with granite that\r\nthey must have had the same origin. Granite is everywhere found to send\r\noff dikes into the overlying rocks, and must therefore have been in a\r\nstate of fusion; that is, it must have existed as lava beneath the\r\nsurface. It is obvious that fluid lava always exists in great quantity\r\nbeneath areas of energetic volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nPortions of this lava must in succession take the solid form. Wherever\r\nthe surface is elevated along a line of fracture, the lava which is\r\naccumulated beneath rises above the level of the general reservoir of\r\nlava, and will therefore part with its heat more rapidly. On cooling, it\r\nbecomes the granitic nucleus of the mountain. We ought also to suppose\r\nthat, by the extremely slow process of the transmission of heat to the\r\nsurface, the crust of the earth is everywhere increasing in thickness;\r\nthat is, the upper portion of the great lava mass is solidifying.\r\n\r\nSir James Hall has shown, by experiment, that earthy substances, reduced\r\nto a state of fusion, become more highly crystalline as they are allowed\r\nto cool more slowly, and are subjected to greater pressure. It is\r\ndifficult to conceive of these conditions existing in a higher degree\r\nthan they do in the cooling masses of lava below the stratified rocks.\r\nThese lavas must therefore take the highly crystalline form which the\r\ngranitic rocks are found to have.\r\n\r\nAll the igneous rocks have therefore existed as subterranean lavas. The\r\nvolcanic rocks have become vitreous, the granitic are crystalline, and\r\nthe trappean are intermediate in structure, coinciding with the\r\ncircumstances of pressure and rate of cooling under which they have\r\nseverally been formed.\r\n\r\n5. _The Elevation of Mountains_ is another result of volcanic action.\r\nThe height of mountains depends, in part, upon general elevation. Yet\r\nthere is a different action, upon which the existence of the mountain,\r\nas such, depends. Whenever igneous action becomes intense under any\r\nportion of the earth's surface, and the elastic force greater than the\r\nrepressive, the solid crust will be broken and raised up, and along this\r\nline of fracture the lava will rise above its general level elsewhere.\r\nThis lava, thus lifted out of the general mass, in time solidifies, and\r\nforms the nucleus of a mountain. At successive periods the elevating\r\nforce is renewed, and adds somewhat to the mountain mass before\r\nsupplied. In this way the mountain is ultimately formed.\r\n\r\nSo far as observations have been made, the elevation of mountains seems\r\nnot to be gradual, but spasmodic; and yet the elevating force probably\r\naccumulates constantly and uniformly. The repressing force consists of\r\nthe weight of the strata above, which may be regarded as constant, and\r\ntheir strength, which is variable. When the elevating force becomes\r\ngreater than both the repressing forces, the crust is fractured. The\r\nstrength of the strata then becomes nothing, and the repressing force is\r\nthe weight alone. The elastic mass below at once expands, and the\r\nrequisite space is furnished by the uplifting of the strata along the\r\nline of fracture. As the ridge of lava which fills this additional space\r\ncools, it recloses, in part, the original fracture, and the repressing\r\nforce again consists of the two elements,--weight and strength. There\r\nwill therefore be no further elevation till the elevating force is again\r\nsuperior to these two forces. Thus the elevating force, though it may\r\naccumulate at a uniform rate, will manifest itself only at considerable\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nAs the accumulation of lava along the line of fracture is the cause of\r\nthe upheaval, every mountain must have a central granitic axis.\r\nSometimes this granitic mass is pushed up through the fissure, as in the\r\ncase of Mont Blanc. At other times, the stratified rock, which formed\r\nthe original surface, is carried up so as to form the surface rock\r\nnearly to the top. In either case, the strata are lifted along the line\r\nof fracture, and left in an _inclined position_. In this position the\r\nolder rocks are always found, wherever there has been any considerable\r\namount of igneous disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, the additional space required by the expansion of the\r\nigneous mass below is furnished, not by the uplifting of the strata, but\r\nby their compression into folds between two lines of upheaval. The\r\nigneous rock is elevated but little above the stratified through which\r\nit had burst; but the stratified rocks have taken the undulatory form,\r\nand the widening of the igneous mass along the lines of fracture has\r\ncompressed the undulations, until the planes of _the strata have become\r\nvertical_. Fig. 82 will give an idea of the successive changes by which\r\nthe vertical position of the strata has been produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.]\r\n\r\nThe force by which mountains are elevated being the elasticity of the\r\nvapor diffused through the subjacent lava, it may happen, if the lava\r\nhave a high degree of fluidity, that this vapor will collect in large\r\nmasses, and rise as far as the lava is in a fluid state. The irregular\r\nflow of lava from craters during an eruption is undoubtedly due to the\r\nrapid ascent of such steam bubbles through the lava. Such an\r\naccumulation of vapor under a mountain mass, if it cannot escape, would\r\nsupport it as long as the temperature remained unchanged. But, upon a\r\nreduction of temperature, the mass which had been upheaved by it would\r\nbe unsupported, and liable at any time to sink. Instances of\r\n_subsidence_ on a comparatively small scale will admit of explanation in\r\nthis way. Papandayang, one of the loftiest volcanic mountains of Java,\r\nsunk down four thousand feet in the year 1772. The area engulfed was\r\nsixteen miles long and six broad. The crater of Kilauea, in one of the\r\nSandwich Islands, was evidently formed in this way. It is situated on\r\nthe side of a mountain, and consists of a chasm eight miles in\r\ncircumference and a thousand feet in depth. Liquid lava can always be\r\nseen boiling in the small craters at the bottom; and at times it rises\r\nso as to overflow them, and fill the chasm to within four hundred feet\r\nof the top, when lateral subterranean passages are opened, by which it\r\nis discharged. The same explanation--a depression of the central\r\nportion--may be given of the formation of the large craters in the\r\nCanary and Grecian islands. It is also probable that Lake Avernus and\r\nothers, in Italy, and some in Germany, have had a similar origin.\r\n\r\nThe subsidence of Papandayang is of importance as a historical fact; and\r\nit is not at all unreasonable to suppose that larger chasms of great\r\ndepth were also sudden subsidences of a similar character. Lake Superior\r\nhas a depth considerably greater than the elevation of its surface above\r\nthe level of the sea. The bottom of the Dead Sea is two thousand six\r\nhundred feet below the surface of the Mediterranean. And at one place in\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean a sounding was attempted with more than six miles of\r\nline, without reaching bottom. These sunken areas, however, though of\r\ngreat extent, occupy only an insignificant portion of the entire surface\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n6. _The Elevation of Continents._--The causes of change of level which\r\nhave been given will not explain those _slow vertical movements_ which\r\nare now taking place in Greenland and the north of Europe, or those by\r\nwhich the present continents have been elevated and the bed of the sea\r\ndepressed. Any cause which will account for these movements must be one\r\noperating for long periods, under large areas, and with great\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\nThe cause which fulfils all these conditions most satisfactorily is a\r\n_variation of temperature_ in the mass of rock underlying the portion of\r\nthe surface whose level is changing. It has before been shown that the\r\ntemperature increases as we descend below the surface; but there is also\r\nreason to suppose that it undergoes great variations. The volcanic grits\r\ninterstratified with the silurian rocks of England show that at the\r\nsilurian period volcanic fires were active below that portion of the\r\nsurface. When the early fossiliferous rocks of this country were\r\ndeposited, the Alleghany Mountains had not been elevated; but before the\r\ntertiary period they had taken nearly their present form. Some portion\r\nof the intermediate period was therefore one of volcanic upheaval. The\r\ntrappean rocks are also evidence of intense volcanic action existing\r\nhere. France, during the tertiary period, was a highly volcanic country;\r\nbut all volcanic activity has now subsided. The Andes have been mostly\r\nelevated since the tertiary period, and are still rising. It is evident,\r\nthen, that at different periods volcanic heat may vary from its highest\r\nto its least degree of activity, below any portion of the earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThis variation of temperature must be followed by variation of volume of\r\nthe earth's crust; that is, it _must produce expansion or contraction_.\r\nExperiments have been made, under the direction of the United States\r\ngovernment, to determine the expansion of the several kinds of rock used\r\nin our public works. It was found that granite expands nearly one two\r\nhundred thousandth of its length for every degree of increased\r\ntemperature, limestone somewhat more than that, and sandstone about\r\ntwice as much. Taking the expansion of the granite as the basis of\r\ncalculation, and supposing the crust for a hundred miles in thickness to\r\nbe undergoing change of temperature, there would be a resulting\r\ndifference of level exceeding two and a half feet for each degree of\r\nchange in temperature, or more than two thousand five hundred feet for a\r\nchange of one thousand degrees.\r\n\r\nThis calculation is made upon the supposition that the law of expansion\r\nis the same for all temperatures, and that no new conditions are\r\nintroduced at high temperatures by the presence of aqueous particles. We\r\nknow, however, that solids expand more rapidly at high temperatures than\r\nat low, and the elasticity of aqueous vapor at high temperatures must\r\nincrease the rate of expansion of the rock through which it is diffused.\r\nAlthough we are not able to introduce, numerically, the effect of these\r\ntwo circumstances, yet it is obvious that they must be considerable.\r\n\r\nThe mean elevation of land above the level of the sea is about nine\r\nhundred feet, the mountain masses above that level not being included;\r\nand the estimated mean depth of the ocean, not including its chasms,\r\ndoes not exceed two thousand six hundred feet. The _total elevation of\r\nthe continental masses_, for which it is necessary to account, does not\r\ntherefore exceed three thousand five hundred feet. This amount of\r\nvertical movement may evidently be produced by the expansion and\r\ncontraction resulting from changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nThese changes of level must, however, be very gradual. Any diminution of\r\ntemperature must result from the transfer of heat to the surface; and\r\nthe conducting power of rocks is very imperfect. The lava in a crater is\r\noften so cooled on the surface that it can be walked on, while but a few\r\nfeet below it is still liquid. Lava currents continue in gradual motion\r\nlong after the surface is nearly cold. This was the case with one of the\r\ncurrents from Ætna for more than nine months after its eruption, and\r\nwith another for ten years. Humboldt visited Jorullo forty years after\r\nit was thrown up, when the lava around the mountain was still in a\r\nheated state, the temperature in the fissures being on the decrease from\r\nyear to year; but twenty years after its ejection the heat was still\r\nsufficient to light a cigar at the depth of a few inches. If so long a\r\nperiod is insufficient to solidify a comparatively small quantity of\r\nmelted rock when the circumstances for cooling are most favorable, we\r\nmay well suppose that centuries would be required to abstract sufficient\r\nheat from the earth's crust to produce any material change in the areas\r\nof continents.\r\n\r\nIf this account of the elevation and subsidence of continents is\r\ncorrect, it would seem that they ought to be constantly undergoing\r\nchange of level. And their _apparent stability_ may be regarded as an\r\nobjection to it. If in any place there is absolutely no vertical\r\nmovement, then those conditions must exist in which, for the time being,\r\nthere is no change of temperature.\r\n\r\nBut it is doubtful whether there ever is absolute stability of any\r\nportion of the surface for long periods of time. Of the minor vertical\r\nmovements of the interior of continents, there can, from the nature of\r\nthe case, be no evidence whatever. Changes of level, where they are\r\nknown to be taking place, are so slow, that they are hardly perceptible\r\nin the period of a human life. Such changes had been going on for\r\ncenturies in Sweden before they were suspected. As accurate observations\r\nhave increased in number, and historical records become available, it is\r\nbecoming known that a very large amount of the seaboard is undergoing\r\nchange of level. It becomes probable, then, that these extremely slow\r\nchanges of level are constantly and everywhere taking place.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the crust of the earth constituting the present\r\ncontinents, being further removed from the centre, would part with its\r\nheat more rapidly, and receive heat from the central mass more slowly,\r\nthan that portion which at present constitutes the bed of the sea. The\r\ncontinents are therefore in a situation to undergo contraction and\r\ndepression, and the bed of the sea is most favorably situated for\r\nrising. If the distribution of water through the mass has any influence\r\nin promoting its expansion, then the bed of the sea would receive this\r\nsupply most abundantly, and the continents the least so. We see, then,\r\nin nature, those provisions for an alteration of level, which, from the\r\ncharacter of the several rock formations, we know to have taken place.\r\nWhen any portion of the earth's surface is covered with the sea, the\r\nconditions exist which will at length elevate it. When it becomes dry\r\nland, the conditions exist which will in time depress it below the level\r\nof the ocean. Hence, those impressions in regard to the land, as stable\r\nbeyond the possibility of change, we ought to abandon; and those\r\nvertical movements, which, when proved, we are accustomed to regard as\r\nextraordinary, we shall, at length, consider as only particular\r\ninstances of one of the most general laws of nature.\r\n\r\n7. _Variations of Climate._--The only sources of heat by which climate\r\ncan be affected are the sun and the heated interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the former melted condition of the entire mass of the earth be\r\nassumed, the temperature of the surface must have been increased, by\r\nconduction of heat from within, for long periods after the superficial\r\nstratum had become solid. It is, however, susceptible of proof, that the\r\npresent climates are not sensibly affected by interior heat, though at a\r\nlittle more than a mile below the surface the temperature is equal to\r\nthat of boiling water. At any time, therefore, after the waters had\r\nbecome condensed, collected into oceans, and become sufficiently cool to\r\nsupport the animal life of which the remains are now found, it is not\r\nprobable that the climate was, to any considerable extent, influenced by\r\nthe heat conducted from the interior.\r\n\r\nStill, there have been great changes of climate since those early\r\norganic forms existed; and, since we have no ground for supposing that\r\nthe temperature of the sun's rays has suffered any reduction, we have to\r\ninquire whether the means of retaining the heat from the sun could at\r\nany time have been different. _The relative position of land and water_\r\ndepends, as we have seen, upon igneous causes, and has been very\r\ndifferent at different times. We shall find that climate must have been\r\ngreatly modified by these changes; for the land radiates and absorbs\r\nheat freely, and water possesses this power in a very low degree.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the zone comprised between the tropics to be occupied by\r\nland, and the portions without these limits to be covered with water.\r\nUnder these conditions, the land, having a nearly vertical sun the\r\nwhole time, would accumulate heat to a degree scarcely compatible with\r\nthe existence of animal life. This is sufficiently proved by the\r\noppressive tropical climates of the present time, influenced as they are\r\nby polar lands and contiguous seas.\r\n\r\nUnder the same conditions, the sea would be heated by contact with the\r\nland, and the heat would be distributed by marine currents to the polar\r\nregions. But the water thus distributed would not part with its heat,\r\nbecause it has but little radiating power, and nowhere comes in contact\r\nwith polar land. It follows, then, that both land and water would be\r\nsubjected to a very high temperature.\r\n\r\nBut, if we suppose the land confined to the polar regions, and the sea\r\nto the equatorial, the opposite results would follow. The equatorial sea\r\nwould absorb but a small proportion of the solar heat which would be\r\nthrown upon it. The land would receive the sun's rays too obliquely to\r\nreceive much elevation of temperature, as the present polar climates\r\nshow. Hence, the temperature of the earth would differ but little from\r\nthat of the planetary spaces, which is fifty-eight degrees below zero, a\r\ntemperature too low to allow of any considerable development of organic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese are the conclusions to which we are led by considering the\r\ndifferent powers of land and water to absorb and radiate heat, and we\r\nshall find that the existing climates are in accordance with these\r\nconclusions. America has a lower temperature than Europe in the same\r\nlatitudes. It has also a smaller proportion of land in the equatorial\r\nregions, and a greater proportion in the north polar regions. The\r\neastern continent is colder in Asia than in Europe in the same\r\nlatitudes. It has also less equatorial and more polar land. The southern\r\nis colder than the northern hemisphere at equal distances from the\r\nequator. There is also less land near the equator on the south side, and\r\nprobably as much land around the south as the north pole.\r\n\r\nHence, we see that there may have been such a relation of land and water\r\nas to account for all the variations of temperature which are known to\r\nhave existed. We cannot say that such actually has been the case. We can\r\ntell, with some degree of accuracy, what portions of the present\r\ncontinents were land at the several geological periods; but\r\nthree-fourths of the surface of the earth is covered with water, and of\r\nthe condition of this portion during those periods we have no means even\r\nof conjecturing. We can only say, that, by the operation of known\r\ncauses, the relative position of land and water may have been such as to\r\nproduce the climates known to have existed at former periods of the\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            Page\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abundance of vegetable products of the coal period,
