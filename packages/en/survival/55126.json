CLAYDEN, M.A.\r\n\r\n  PRINCIPAL OF THE\r\n  ROYAL ALBERT MEMORIAL COLLEGE, EXETER\r\n\r\n  LONDON\r\n  JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET\r\n  1905\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRINTED BY\r\n  WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,\r\n  LONDON AND BECCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the meteorologist I hope the following pages may prove not only of\r\nsome interest, but of practical value as a small step towards that\r\ngreater exactness of language which is essential before we can attempt\r\nto explain all the details of cloud structure, or even interchange\r\nour ideas and observations with adequate precision. The varieties\r\ndepicted and described have been selected from many hundreds, as those\r\nwhich seem to me to show such differences of form as to imply distinct\r\ndifferences in the conditions to which they are due. I have not\r\nattempted to deal with the physical causes of condensation except in a\r\ngeneral way, being unwilling to introduce diagrams of isothermals and\r\nadiabatics and such purely scientific methods into a work also intended\r\nfor a wider public. For those who wish to pursue this part of the\r\nsubject I have appended a list of papers from the _Quarterly Journal\r\nof the Royal Meteorological Society_ and other sources, which may\r\nserve as references. I also hope that some more votaries of the science\r\nmay be induced to realize that meteorology does not consist solely of\r\nthe tabulation of long columns of records, but includes subjects for\r\ninvestigation as much more beautiful as they are more difficult.\r\n\r\nTo the artist I trust they may also be of some use, by calling\r\nattention to the variety and exquisite beauty of the sky. Nothing is\r\nmore extraordinary in art than the general negligence of cloud-forms.\r\nMany of them are quite as worthy of careful drawing as the leaves of a\r\ntree, the flowers of a field, the ripples on a stream, or the texture\r\nof a carpet, or a marble pavement. Yet it is the common rule to find\r\npictures, which are otherwise marvellous examples of skill and care,\r\ndisfigured by impossible skies with vague, shapeless clouds, as untrue\r\nto nature as it would be possible to make them. Grace of outline,\r\ndelicacy of detail and texture, richness of contrast, beauty of form\r\nand light and colour, all are present in the skies, and combine to make\r\na whole well worthy of the best that art can give. The illustrations I\r\noffer are not selected for pictorial effect; they are chosen from a\r\npurely scientific point of view; but they are enough to indicate what\r\ncould be done if the facts of nature were treated with high artistic\r\nskill.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the meteorologist and the artist, there are a much\r\nlarger number who follow neither profession, but who love Nature in\r\nall her moods; and to them also I hope these pages may be of interest.\r\nIndeed, if only a few of them should be stimulated to take up a branch\r\nof nature study which has given me many an hour of quiet enjoyment, the\r\nlabour of bringing these notes together will not have been in vain.\r\n\r\n      ARTHUR W.

Go where we will, do what we will, we cannot\r\neasily escape from the sky, or avoid noticing some of its features\r\nand coupling them with the varying conditions of weather. We all\r\nsometimes want to know if it is likely to rain, or whether some other\r\nchange is probable; and experience soon shows us that the clouds give\r\nthe simplest and most obvious indication of what we may expect. It is\r\nalmost impossible to avoid noticing that certain types of cloud, or the\r\nsimultaneous appearance of certain types, is the usual accompaniment\r\nof definite kinds of weather or of particular changes. Thus it is that\r\nmost people acquire some small measure of weather wisdom before their\r\nschooldays are over.\r\n\r\nGeneration after generation, through all human history, the same causes\r\nmust have led to the same conclusions; and the study of clouds must,\r\ntherefore, be one of the oldest of all branches of scientific inquiry.\r\nYet, old as it is, it is still in its infancy, having made very little\r\nadvance indeed towards the precision of an exact science.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for this want of growth, and so far as\r\nthe theoretical aspects of the subject are concerned it is easy\r\nenough to understand. Clouds are among the most inaccessible of\r\nterrestrial objects. Except by balloon ascents, by sending up kites\r\nbearing recording instruments, or by making observations among the\r\nmountain-tops, we have no means of getting at them to study the\r\nconditions under which they exist. Temperature, pressure, humidity,\r\nhave generally to be guessed at, those guesses being based on the\r\nscanty data which have been laboriously obtained by one or another of\r\nthese cumbrous methods. Moreover, many clouds have such vast dimensions\r\nthat it is very difficult to grasp all that goes on in such a space.\r\n\r\nBesides the difficulty of attacking the problems presented by cloud\r\nformation, it is probable that even if we could have got among the\r\nclouds at will, we should have understood little more than we do, from\r\na want of sufficient certainty on many of the purely physical questions\r\ninvolved. It is not many years since Mr. J. Aitken discovered the\r\nnecessity for material nuclei as a first step in the formation of cloud\r\nparticles, and not many months have elapsed since Mr. C. T. R. Wilson\r\nshowed that those particles can be formed by the action of radiation\r\non the air itself. There is nothing surprising, therefore, in the fact\r\nthat our theoretical knowledge of the why and wherefore of the facts\r\nrevealed by a study of clouds is limited to general principles, and\r\nquite fails to say exactly why each special form should be assumed. The\r\nmatter for surprise is quite different.\r\n\r\nTheoretical explanations are not the first step in the working out\r\nof a branch of science. It begins with the acquisition, by diligent\r\nand painstaking observation, of a great mass of facts. This may go on\r\nfor centuries, the accumulation growing greater and greater, until\r\nat last some one comes who examines the records, classifies them\r\ncarefully, and finally makes a summary in the form of a number of\r\ngeneralizations, which are announced under the name of Laws.\r\n\r\nTwo examples of such “Laws” will suffice. Astronomers for centuries had\r\nobserved the movements of the planets, always with increasing accuracy,\r\nuntil Tycho Brahe made his famous series of observations on the planet\r\nMars. These materials fell into the hands of Kepler, and the result of\r\nhis work was the announcement of Kepler’s Laws, which state the rules\r\nwhich govern the movements of the planets in their orbits. He found\r\nthat the records could not be accounted for unless the planets moved\r\nin a certain way, but he knew nothing of the reasons for a method and\r\norder which clearly existed.\r\n\r\nKepler’s Laws, in fact, rest upon another set, namely, Newton’s Laws of\r\nGravitation, and these are themselves a second example. They are the\r\nsummary of accumulated experience, and even at the present day we know\r\nnothing certain as to why two bodies should attract each other, and\r\nnothing as to why that mutual attraction should act as it was found to\r\nact by Newton.\r\n\r\nThe observational part of cloud study, however, is still in its\r\ninfancy, in spite of the fact that it has been going on for such\r\ncountless ages. We are still in the condition of the humble observers\r\nengaged in the comparatively humdrum task of gathering facts for\r\nfuture arrangement and interpretation. Cloud observers, in all ages,\r\nhave suffered from a peculiar difficulty. They have had no common\r\nlanguage, no code of signs by which they could benefit from the work\r\nof those who had gone before them, no means of transmitting their own\r\nexperience to each other, or to those who would come after them. No\r\nprogress would be possible in any study under such conditions, for\r\neach person would begin where the previous generation began, instead\r\nof taking up the task where others had left it. In all languages there\r\nis an extraordinary scarcity of cloud names, and such as do exist are\r\nfrequently applied to quite different forms by different people. So\r\npronounced is this lack of terms, that any one who tries to describe\r\na sky without using any of the modern scientific names, finds himself\r\nobliged to rely on long detailed descriptions, backed with references\r\nto well-known objects, whose outlines or structures resemble the\r\nclouds more or less vaguely; and even then he has to be a word-painter\r\nof singular skill if his description calls up in the mind of the reader\r\na picture much like the original.\r\n\r\nIt was to meet this want of a common tongue that Luke Howard, in 1803,\r\nproposed his scheme of cloud names. He recognized three main types of\r\ncloud architecture, which he named Cirrus, Stratus, and Cumulus. Cirrus\r\nincluded all forms which are built up of delicate threads, like the\r\nfibres in a fragment of wool; Stratus was applied to all clouds which\r\nlie in level sheets; and Cumulus was the lumpy form.\r\n\r\nBy combinations of these terms other clouds were described. Thus, a\r\nquantity of cirrus arranged in a sheet was called cirro-stratus, while\r\nhigh, thin clouds like cirrus, but made up of detached rounded balls,\r\nwas cirro-cumulus. Many cumulus clouds, arranged in a sheet with little\r\nspace between them, became cumulo-stratus, while the great clouds from\r\nwhich our heavy rains descend partake, to some extent, of all three\r\ntypes, and were therefore distinguished by a special name--Nimbus.\r\n\r\nThis system had much to recommend it. The three fundamental types\r\nwere obvious to all. Their names were descriptive, and were derived\r\nfrom a dead language, so that no living international jealousies were\r\nraised. It was sufficiently detailed to serve the purposes of the time,\r\nwhen accurate observation was in its infancy. Hence it was universally\r\nadopted, and will pretty certainly hold its own as the broad basis upon\r\nwhich any more detailed system must necessarily rest.\r\n\r\nIt has done excellent service; but although observation of clouds in\r\na general way is far from complete, attention is now being given to\r\nmuch smaller details and much more minute differences of form, and our\r\nvocabulary must be amplified. Precision of description is the first\r\nessential of a satisfactory system, and the question is, what sort of\r\nedifice can we build on Luke Howard’s foundation.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty is the infinite variety of clouds. Certain forms\r\nmay be arbitrarily selected as types, and names may be given to them;\r\nbut however well they are chosen, a very short period of observation\r\nwill show that there are all manner of intermediate forms, which make\r\na perfect gradation from one type to another. This fact should never\r\nbe forgotten. There is always a danger that the use of any system\r\nof names based on types shall lead to the neglect of everything not\r\ntypical. A curious illustration is afforded by the well-known fact,\r\nthat in arranging collections of fossil shells, it is frequently found\r\nthat some specimens do not exactly match the type examples to which\r\nnames have been assigned. In former days it was the custom to throw\r\naside such “bad specimens,” as they did not show plainly the specific\r\ncharacters. It is now realized that they have a value of their own,\r\nin that they are the links in the evolutionary chain, once supposed\r\nto be missing. Indeed, it is not unfrequent nowadays to see carefully\r\nselected series, showing the gradual change whereby one species\r\npassed into another, displayed in the place of honour, while the type\r\nspecimens are relegated to humbler places in the general collection.\r\n\r\nTypes there must be, no doubt, and where the series is continuous,\r\nsome one must make the selection. With clouds the series is absolutely\r\ncontinuous. The task is like choosing typical links from a long chain\r\nin which each link is almost exactly like its neighbours, yet no\r\ntwo are alike, and the greater the distance between them the less\r\ntheir likeness. Clearly any system put forward must be accompanied\r\nby illustrations, so that all may know exactly which links have been\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to meet the want; some of the systems\r\nproposed being based on the forms assumed by the clouds, some on\r\ntheir supposed mode of origin, and some on their altitudes. Those\r\nwhich were not founded on Luke Howard’s types had no chance of being\r\naccepted, while knowledge was not yet sufficiently far advanced to make\r\nclassifications based on origin of form at all possible. But the great\r\nreason why none of the proposed schemes could come into general use was\r\nthat they were put forward without adequate illustration, so that none\r\nbut their authors knew exactly what they meant.[1]\r\n\r\nMatters came to a head in 1891, when an International Meteorological\r\nConference met at Munich. One object of this gathering was to promote\r\ninquiries into the forms and motions of clouds, by means of concerted\r\nobservations at the various institutes and observatories of the globe.\r\nLuke Howard’s system was not enough for the purpose in view, and the\r\naddition of more detailed terms had to be settled before work could be\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hildebrandsson, of Upsala, and the Hon. Ralph Abercromby\r\njointly submitted a revised scheme, the main feature of which was the\r\nintroduction of a new class of clouds, to be distinguished by the\r\nprefix alto-before the other name. Such alto clouds were less lofty and\r\ndenser than cirrus. This scheme was the best before the Conference, and\r\nwithout waiting to discuss, and possibly improve it, it was formally\r\nadopted, and a committee appointed to arrange and publish an atlas\r\nshowing pictures of the type-forms. This atlas did not appear until\r\n1896, and in the mean time the Rev. W. Clement Ley had published\r\nproposals of his own, some of which had much to recommend them. But\r\nhe was too late. The International Committee had come to a decision,\r\nand, although it may be far from ideal, the system backed by such an\r\nauthority must be regarded as the standard until some similar gathering\r\nhas given worldwide sanction to a change, and even then it would be\r\nbetter to modify by addition rather than by substitution.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the following pages are named in general accordance\r\nwith this International Code, but they are by no means restricted to\r\ntypes. Their object is not to attempt any repetition of the work which\r\nhas already been well done by the Atlas Committee, but rather to show\r\nthe chief varieties within a type. It will, however, become abundantly\r\nevident that the standard system is far from complete, and that any\r\nminute and detailed study of cloud-form must take note of the precise\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThis at once raises the question whether many of these varieties\r\nare not sufficiently distinct to be given definite names. If a\r\nmeteorologist is told that cirrus clouds were seen on a particular\r\noccasion, he instinctively asks--What sort of cirrus? and is utterly\r\nunable to form any mental picture of the clouds until the question\r\nhas been answered by a detailed description. A glance at a few of the\r\nplates further on will show the difficulty plainly, and it occurs with\r\nother forms of cloud as well as cirrus.\r\n\r\nIs it not time that the International names were regarded as those of\r\nthe cloud genera, and to add specific names for those varieties which\r\nseem to imply some difference in kind in the conditions which have led\r\nto their formation? This has been here attempted by translating into\r\nLatin the ordinary English term by which the variety would naturally\r\nbe described. More extended observation will probably show that other\r\nspecies should be introduced, and possibly some of those suggested\r\nin these pages may have to be subdivided. Whatever the names may be,\r\nspecific distinction of some sort is an essential preliminary to\r\ndetailed study of the why and wherefore of the particular forms.\r\n\r\nThe International system is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A. Upper clouds.\r\n    (_a_) Cirrus.\r\n    (_b_) Cirro-stratus.\r\n  B. Intermediate clouds.\r\n    (_a_) Cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus.\r\n    (_b_) Alto-stratus.\r\n  C. Lower clouds.\r\n    (_a_) Strato-cumulus.\r\n    (_b_) Nimbus.\r\n  D. Clouds of diurnal ascending currents.\r\n    (_a_) Cumulus and cumulo-nimbus.\r\n  E. High fogs.\r\n    (_b_) Stratus.\r\n\r\nIn this tabulation the forms marked (_a_) are detached and occur in dry\r\nweather, while those marked (_b_) are widely extended. The original\r\nscheme also gives the mean heights of the various types, but these\r\nvalues have been omitted here because they are extremely variable,\r\nand impossible to ascertain with any approach to accuracy by mere eye\r\nestimates. They vary also with the season, and probably also with the\r\nlocality. Moreover, the altitude is no guide to the name, except that\r\non the whole the types occur in the order given, taking group A as the\r\nhighest and group E as the lowest. In the chapter on cloud altitudes\r\nthis subject will be further considered, and under the descriptions\r\nof cloud-forms their average height or actual measurements for the\r\nparticular specimen figured will be given whenever possible.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the description of individual forms, it may not be out\r\nof place to give brief consideration to the best means of observing\r\nthem in nature. For eye observation, of course, no directions are\r\nneeded when we are dealing with the lower and denser varieties; but\r\nwhen we come to the highest groups it sometimes becomes necessary to\r\nprotect the eye from the brilliant glare which may make it impossible\r\nto detect the real structure. Smoked glass, neutral-tinted spectacles,\r\nor yellow glass all have something to recommend them; but by far the\r\nmost convenient means is to look, not at the clouds themselves, but\r\nat their images formed in a black mirror. A lantern cover glass, or a\r\nthin piece of plate-glass, blacked on the back with some black paint,\r\nserves admirably. But all black paints are not equally good. The best\r\nare oil paints which dry with a glossy surface, the so-called enamels.\r\nThey have the advantage that the varnish with which they are mixed has\r\nan index of refraction not very different from that of the glass. The\r\nconsequence is that so little light is reflected from the blackened\r\nback, compared with that which is reflected from the front surface of\r\nthe glass, that the second image can only be detected with difficulty.\r\nIf the mirror is a piece of black or deeply coloured glass all trace of\r\nthe second image is lost.\r\n\r\nWith this simple appliance it is easy to study the details of the\r\nthinnest clouds right up to the sun, and even the image of the sun\r\nitself may be glanced at without serious discomfort. Nor is the general\r\ndiminution of brightness the only gain. If the glass is so held that\r\nthe light from the cloud makes an angle of about 33 degrees with the\r\nsurface, some of the blue light from the sky is suppressed altogether,\r\nwhile that from the cloud is practically unaffected. The exact fraction\r\nsuppressed depends upon the part of the sky relative to the sun, and\r\nalso on the position of the mirror, but a few minutes’ trial will show\r\nwhen the maximum effect has been reached.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing to see for the first time how the delicate filaments\r\nof cirrus or the beautiful structures of cirro-cumulus stand out\r\nshining white on the deep blue background; and the use of the black\r\nmirror is a revelation to most. It also has one indirect advantage,\r\nwhich is really more important than it seems. By gazing down into a\r\nmirror long-continued observations can be made, and one form of cloud\r\nmay be watched changing into another, and possibly back again into\r\nits original shape, without any danger of incurring that unpleasant\r\nresult of much looking upwards which is sometimes known as exhibition\r\nheadache. Such a mirror may be quite small, so that it can be carried\r\nin a pocket-book, a point of some moment, as many of the forms of\r\ncirrus are exceedingly transient, coming and going in a few minutes,\r\nwhile others are in a state of continuous change. This is particularly\r\noften the case with the exquisite ripple clouds, and the delicate\r\nlacework of the higher kinds of cirrus.\r\n\r\nStill another advantage possessed by the mirror is that it makes it\r\neasy to see the solar halos formed on the verge of a cyclone, and\r\nto detect their iridescent colouring in a way which is quite beyond\r\nthe reach of the naked eye or any protective spectacles. Every one\r\nis familiar with the faint halos formed round the moon, but the\r\ncorresponding solar phenomenon is comparatively little known, though it\r\nis far commoner, much more brilliant, and often glows with colour. Its\r\nvery brightness, and that of the background on which it is projected,\r\nhides it from the eye, except on those rare occasions when the sun is\r\nconveniently hidden by some thicker cloud.\r\n\r\nIf some permanent record is desired, much can be done with a few light\r\nstrokes of a pencil, but more ambitious pictures are best secured\r\nby the use of soft pastels, aided by a liberal use of the finger or\r\nleather stump. Ordinary paints, whether oil or water-colour, are of\r\nlittle use for actual study of cloud detail, except in the hands of a\r\nhighly skilled artist who knows how to get the effect he wants in the\r\nminimum of time.\r\n\r\nBut no sketching or drawing can make records of cirrus or alto clouds\r\nwith the speed and accuracy necessary for careful study. Photography\r\nis really the only way in which the amazing wealth of detail can be\r\ntruthfully portrayed. Yet even the camera has its limitations. It\r\ndoes not record colour, and completely fails to delineate the forms\r\nof alto-stratus, stratus, or nimbus, if they are present in the most\r\ntypical condition, that is to say, when they cover the whole sky with\r\na uniform tint. It is only when these forms are more or less broken up\r\nthat a photograph, or anything other than a carefully coloured picture,\r\nwill represent them at all.\r\n\r\nCloud photography, even of the most delicate and brilliant varieties,\r\nis easy enough when the right methods are followed; but these are not\r\nthe same as those which are right for portraiture or landscape work\r\nof the usual kind. The background of blue sky produces almost the same\r\neffect on the plate as the image of the cloud itself, and the whole art\r\nconsists in an adequate exaggeration of the minute difference so as to\r\nreveal the details of form and structure.\r\n\r\nA slow plate--the accompanying illustrations have all been taken\r\non Mawson and Swan’s photo-mechanical plates--extremely cautious\r\ndevelopment, and sometimes intensification of the image, are all that\r\nis necessary; but the process becomes easier if, instead of pointing\r\nthe camera to the cloud, it is directed to the image formed in a\r\nproperly constructed black mirror. Many of the following studies have\r\nbeen taken by this method, and details of the camera and processes\r\nemployed will be found in a later chapter, for the convenience of any\r\none who may be inspired to take up a fascinating branch of photography.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that reference will be made to the average altitudes\r\nof the different types of cloud, and to the actual altitude of some of\r\nthe varieties shown. The question will, no doubt, have occurred to\r\nsome as to how those altitudes have been measured. The methods are all\r\nmore or less complicated, involving rather laborious calculation. They\r\ngenerally depend upon simultaneous observations made from two stations\r\nat opposite ends of a measured base line. Sometimes the observations\r\nare made directly by pointing an instrument at each station to some\r\nagreed point of the cloud. It is obvious that the two directions must\r\nconverge to this point. If the convergence is measured, the exact\r\ndistance from either station can be calculated, and if the angle\r\nbetween the cloud-point and the horizon beneath it is noted, it is a\r\nsimple matter to deduce the actual altitude of the cloud. At other\r\nplaces the observers have relied upon the comparison of photographs\r\nsimultaneously taken from the two stations. In this method it is\r\nnecessary to know the exact direction in which the camera is pointed,\r\nand the position of the image upon the plate then gives the direction\r\nof the cloud as seen from that particular station, and the subsequent\r\ncalculations are the same.\r\n\r\nMeasurements by one or the other of the above methods have been made at\r\nseveral places, the most extensive series being those which have been\r\ncompiled at Upsala, and at the Blue Hill Observatory in Massachusetts.\r\nThe method employed by the writer at Exeter has been rather different,\r\nand a description will be found later on in the chapter on Cloud\r\nAltitudes, the fuller consideration of which comes naturally after the\r\ndifferent forms have been described and compared.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] See reference No. 2 on p. 181.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCIRRUS\r\n\r\n\r\nA CLOUD is sometimes defined as any visible mass composed of small\r\nparticles of ice or water suspended in the air, and formed by\r\ncondensation from the state of vapour. As a general rule this is exact\r\nenough, but under certain circumstances it is possible to have the\r\nparticles so small, and so thinly scattered, that it is not fully\r\nsatisfied. The resulting mass may not be actually visible. The presence\r\nof the condensed particles may be indicated by nothing more than a\r\nslight whitening of the blue sky, or by the formation about the sun or\r\nmoon of bright circles of light known as halos. If such a halo appears,\r\nit is generally a phenomenon of brief duration. Sometimes the circle\r\nbreaks and becomes incomplete by the passing away of the thin patch of\r\ncloud, sometimes the cloud increases in density until the rings are\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest variety of this halo-producing structure is quite\r\ninvisible to the eye. It is so thin as to have no distinctly noticeable\r\neffect upon the colour of the sky, but the optical results of its\r\npresence may be very remarkable. Highly complicated systems of rings\r\nare sometimes produced, the rings, as a rule, falling into two groups.\r\nThe commonest form has the sun (or moon) in the centre, and a circle\r\nof pale light at a distance of about 22 degrees. Larger rings are seen\r\nless frequently, which have an angular radius of about 46 degrees, and\r\nas a rule have the sun situated on the ring itself. In Plate 1 we have\r\na part of such a great halo. The camera was directed towards the east,\r\nand tilted upwards at an angle of about 40 degrees. The sun was behind\r\nthe camera, in the south-west, and the ring could be traced right up to\r\nit on either side.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the sun was surrounded partially by a halo of the\r\nmore ordinary type, which was brightly coloured, making an effective\r\ncontrast to the dull white of the greater ring. The phenomenon did\r\nnot last more than half an hour, and the changes in its appearance\r\ncoincided with a growing density of cloud. When first noticed the\r\ngreat ring was alone, and the sky was of a full blue, but a silvery\r\nfilm came gradually up from the south-west, and the smaller and\r\nbrighter halo flashed out as the delicate curtain came near the sun.\r\nSlowly the cloud spread to the north-east, gathering density from the\r\nopposite point of the compass; and by the time the ordinary halo was at\r\nits best, the great white ring had completely vanished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 1.\r\n\r\nPART OF A GREAT HALO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 2.\r\n\r\nPART OF A SOLAR HALO.]\r\n\r\nThese circles, and the bright spots called mock-suns or mock-moons\r\nwhich often accompany them, can all be explained on the assumption\r\nthat their cause is the passage of light through a veil composed of\r\nhexagonal crystals of ice. The simple halo of 22 degrees radius is\r\ncommon in most parts of the world, being very generally formed by the\r\nfilm of high cloud which marks the advancing edge of a cyclonic cloud\r\nsystem. A portion of one is shown in Plate 2, in which the rudimentary\r\nfibrous structure of the sheet of cloud is distinctly seen. Halos of\r\nthis sort are frequently coloured, often most brilliantly so; but the\r\ntints are seldom noticed unless a black mirror is used. They are\r\nsometimes quite as bright as those of an ordinary rainbow, but instead\r\nof being projected upon a background of dark rain-clouds, they are\r\nseen against a part of the sky which is near the sun, and therefore\r\nexceptionally bright.\r\n\r\nThe red is always on the inside of the ring, the violet outside,\r\nthereby distinguishing them at once from the so-called coronæ, which\r\nare formed around the sun or moon when shining through a sheet of alto\r\nor other lower cloud made up of liquid particles. In these the radius\r\nof the rings is much less, and the red is on the outside, the violet\r\nactually touching the central luminary.\r\n\r\nThe cloud which produces halos is called cirro-nebula. It is much\r\nthinner, and on an average higher than cirro-stratus. Mr. Ley named\r\nit cirro-velum (or cirro-veil), but cirro-nebula has now got to be\r\nfairly well understood. It sometimes appears and disappears in a\r\ncurious manner, showing that it occurs in patches, which drift about or\r\nwhich keep forming and melting away, only to repeat the process. If,\r\nhowever, it forms part of an advancing cyclone fringe, then the sky\r\ngets whiter and whiter, until it is covered with a sheet of undoubted\r\ncirro-stratus. This process of growing density is shown in progress in\r\nPlate 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 3.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-NEBULA CHANGING TO CIRRO-STRATUS.]\r\n\r\nCirro-nebula, as we shall call it, floats at very great altitudes in\r\ntemperate regions; but in polar latitudes, where the optical phenomena\r\npeculiar to it are most brilliant and diversified, it seems probable\r\nthat the ice dust is much lower down, even in actual proximity to the\r\nground. In England its height varies greatly with the time of year, and\r\nother circumstances, but mounts up in summer to such altitudes as nine\r\nmiles or more; the greatest height yet recorded being 9·6 miles, or\r\nabout 15,500 metres, at Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe change from cirro-nebula to cirro-stratus is generally accompanied\r\nby the formation of a distinct fibrous structure, easily observable by\r\nthe black mirror. This is not really a new feature, but only a further\r\ndevelopment of a structure already existing, but too minute to be\r\neasily seen. True halo-producing cirro-nebula may usually be shown to\r\npossess more or less of a fibrous texture in an indirect way, which is\r\nworth a brief description.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe the spots on the sun and other features of the\r\nsolar surface, it is a common practice to hold a white screen, say,\r\nabout a foot from the eyepiece of a telescope, while the instrument\r\nis pointed to the sun. An image, considerably magnified, is thus\r\nprojected on to the screen, and the solar details can be studied with\r\nease and safety. If thin clouds drift before the sun, their images are\r\nsimilarly projected as they pass across its disc, and it is possible\r\nthus to detect not only the fibrous texture but also the movement of\r\ncirro-nebula.[2]\r\n\r\nThe change into cirro-stratus is also attended by a marked fall in\r\naltitude, but whether this is due to an actual descent of the cloud\r\nparticles, or to a downward spread of the conditions which give rise\r\nto them, cannot at present be definitely settled. The balance of\r\nprobability points very strongly towards the downward spread of the\r\nconditions. It is likely that the clouds, particularly the cyclonic\r\nspecimens, are wedge-shaped, and that as they pass overhead we see\r\nfirst the thin edge, and later on the thicker parts, which project\r\nmuch lower down. This is just one of those many minor problems in\r\ncloud mechanics which we are not able to solve from the scanty data on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nOccasionally cirro-nebula breaks up into little detached\r\nsemi-transparent cloudlets, all of them exceedingly thin, and showing\r\na complicated mottling, resembling, on a minute scale, the ripple\r\nclouds of much lower altitudes. Such a sky is depicted in Plate 4, but\r\nno reproduction can possibly do justice to the minute and delicate\r\nfeatures of the real thing. The arrangement of the faint markings was\r\nin a state of continual flux, curiously similar to the ever-changing\r\naspect of the sun’s photosphere when seen under adequate power. Some\r\nparts of the cloud stratum would at one moment break up into distinct\r\ngranules arranged in complicated patterns, other parts would assume a\r\nfibrous texture, and yet other places would show a continuous smooth\r\nsheet. In a minute or two all would be changed--the smooth part\r\ngranulated, the fibres vanished, and the granules fused together, and\r\nso on, no two of a series of photographs representing the same details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 4.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-NEBULA CHANGING TO CIRRO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nThese changes of form continued until the whole was hidden from view\r\nby a veil of much lower stratiform cloud, one advance portion of which\r\nis shown. Plate 4 does not represent a type or a distinct variety of\r\ncloud. It is an intermediate form, or a temporary condition, showing\r\ncirro-nebula in the act of changing into cirro-cumulus, or possibly\r\ncirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCirro-nebula itself, in its simpler form, is, however, a distinct type.\r\nIt is true that it never persists over one locality for more than an\r\nhour or two without passing into some denser form, but while it lasts\r\nits features are so distinctive, and the optical phenomena to which it\r\ngives rise are so striking and significant, that it is a matter for\r\nsurprise that it should in the International system have been relegated\r\nto the position of a subordinate variety of cirrus. It is more nearly\r\nrelated to cirro-stratus, but is sufficiently distinct from that to\r\ndeserve at least specific rank.\r\n\r\nTrue typical cirrus must have a plainly shown fibrous structure. The\r\nfibres may cross and interlace, they may radiate in fan-like manner,\r\nor they may curl and twist like a well-trimmed ostrich feather. The\r\nclouds so formed must not be arranged in a continuous level sheet, or\r\nthey at once become cirro-stratus, and it is impossible to invent a\r\ndefinition which will mark the exact limits of either type. Typical\r\ncirrus consists of detached clouds. They cast no shadows on the\r\nlandscape, for the simple reasons that they are semi-transparent and\r\ntheir component parts too narrow. If the sun is shining down obliquely\r\nthrough the naked boughs of a tall tree, it will be seen that the\r\nlowest twigs cast fairly sharp shadows on the ground, but that even\r\nthese are bordered by a fading rim; the twigs further up cast no sharp\r\nshadows, but broader faint bands of shade; while the topmost boughs\r\ncast no shadows which can clearly be identified. In other words, the\r\nmore distant the narrow twig is from the ground the narrower the real\r\nshadow or umbra, and the broader the penumbra becomes, until when the\r\ndistance is sufficient the shadow is all penumbra. Cirrus filaments\r\nthrow nothing but a faint penumbra. Indeed, it is only when they lie\r\nin the earth’s shadow, and stand against the background of a faintly\r\nlighted sky, that they show any sign of shadow even on themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that they are composed of particles of ice. They are\r\nformed at altitudes where the thermometer must be many degrees below\r\nfreezing-point, and not a few of the thinner examples show fragmentary\r\nhalos like those of cirro-nebula.\r\n\r\nTheir actual altitudes are very variable, being greater in summer than\r\nin winter, and reaching a maximum for any given station after a long\r\nspell of hot weather. Exact measurements have not yet been made in\r\ntropical latitudes or in polar regions, but there is every reason to\r\nexpect that the upper limit of cirrus for equatorial districts will\r\nbe found to be much higher than in the temperate zones where actual\r\nobservations have been made. In places nearer to the Arctic Circle it\r\nis also almost certain that the altitudes will be less.\r\n\r\nIn the New England states, as shown by the Blue Hill observations, the\r\nmaximum altitude for summer was found to be little under 15,000 metres.\r\nAt Upsala, in Sweden, it was 13,300 metres. The average altitudes at\r\nthe same observatories were, respectively, about 9900 and 8800 metres.\r\nAt Exeter the writer’s own measurements give an average for the summer\r\nmonths of 10,200 metres, with a minimum rather lower than was the case\r\nin America or Sweden, and with a maximum far above the foreign values.\r\nIn winter cirrus certainly comes much lower down, but the number of\r\nobservations is fewer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 5.\r\n\r\nHIGH CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Excelsus._)]\r\n\r\nThe loftiest variety of cirrus appears in the afternoon in very hot\r\nweather, sometimes quite late in the evening; and in autumn it is by no\r\nmeans a rare event for it to suddenly form just when the sunset colours\r\nare fading, or even after they have paled into twilight. Under such\r\ncircumstances it stands out of a shining silvery grey colour against\r\nthe background of the darkening sky. A specimen of it is shown in Plate\r\n5, which shows its extreme slightness of form and delicacy of texture.\r\nSometimes it remains visible so long after the stars have begun to\r\nshow as to give the idea that it is self luminous, and the illusion\r\nis certainly very strong. The writer has noted several instances in\r\nwhich it was plainly visible, like a silvery curtain, though the sky as\r\na whole was so dark that stars like the five brightest points of the\r\nGreat Bear could be seen through the cloud, and much smaller stars down\r\nto the third and fourth magnitude were plainly visible in the clear\r\nintervals. It has sometimes been called luminous cloud, and Mr. Ley\r\nestimated its altitude at upwards of 90,000 metres; but if we think of\r\nit as reflecting the light of the distant colourless twilight there is\r\nno need to regard it as anything fundamentally different from other\r\nclouds, or to assume a greater altitude than we know to have been the\r\ncase. The specimen figured occurred in the early afternoon on June\r\n12, 1899, at Exeter, and careful measurements of its altitude were\r\nmade. This worked out as 17·02 miles, or more than 27,000 metres, a\r\nvalue so much greater than all other measurements of the kind that it\r\nwas only after most careful verification and reference to duplicate\r\nrecords that it could be accepted. It differs in several ways from the\r\nlower varieties, being thinner, more glistening, and in every way more\r\ndelicate. A suitable distinctive name would be high cirrus, or cirrus\r\nexcelsus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 6.\r\n\r\nWINDY CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Ventosus._)]\r\n\r\nLower down by thousands of metres come the feathery masses of typical\r\nwindy cirrus, such as are shown in Plate 6. Indeed, in cold winter\r\nweather they occur within three or four thousand metres of the ground.\r\nIn the instance figured the wind was blowing from left to right, and\r\nthe clouds were travelling swiftly. The upper filaments appeared to be\r\nrepeatedly torn away from the main masses, while the long faint streaks\r\nwhich trail below and behind are evidently due to streams of fine\r\nparticles falling from the main centres of condensation into a less\r\nrapidly moving stratum below. There is no room for doubt that these\r\nclouds, like others of a similar order, are formed by a direct passage\r\nfrom the vapour to the solid, or that the fibres are made of minute\r\nsnowflakes. The condensation is evidently attended by rapid movements,\r\nwhich draw out the cloud, as fast as it is formed, into long curving\r\nlines which mark lines of motion. The variety is always, therefore, an\r\nindication of strong winds and rapid eddying movements in the region\r\nin which it occurs. Such strong disturbances overhead almost always\r\naccompany similar but less intense movements at the ground-level, and\r\nwhen they do not accompany them they precede them. The cloud is well\r\nnamed windy cirrus, which may be converted into a specific name, cirrus\r\nventosus.\r\n\r\nThe next variety we come to (Plate 7) is in some ways rather similar.\r\nIt is, however, thinner, more delicate, and is entirely composed\r\nof fine threads, which are more systematically arranged. Generally\r\nthere is a bundle, or several bundles, of long parallel fibres, which\r\nform, so to say, the quill of the feather, with numbers of shorter\r\nthreads branching out from them at various angles. Cirrus ventosus was\r\nindicative of irregular movements in various directions; this variety\r\npoints also to complicated movements, but executed in accordance with\r\nsome sort of system, strangely complex and wonderfully ordered. The\r\nspecimen figured is the type of what Mr. Ley called cirro-filum, or\r\nthread cirrus, and his name can hardly be bettered. It is a cloud of\r\nsummer, and occurs rather high up in the cirrus zone, but no actual\r\nmeasurements can be quoted. It is fairly common, but not nearly so\r\nfrequent as the last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 7.\r\n\r\nTHREAD CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-filum._)]\r\n\r\nA somewhat more familiar variety is shown in Plate 8. Little irregular\r\nfeathers of cirrus, from which long tapering streamers point downwards\r\nin graceful curves, or else lag behind in the direction from which\r\nthe clouds have travelled. If clouds of this type are carefully\r\nwatched, it will soon be seen that each feathery head is a centre of\r\ncondensation, and that the tails or streamers are nothing else than\r\nfalling particles, which dwindle slowly away by evaporation, and which\r\ngradually sink below the level of the heads. It is usual, in dealing\r\nwith cloud-forms like these, to speak of air-currents of different\r\nvelocities almost as if the winds at different levels were as clearly\r\nseparated as oil and water, or even air and water. This can hardly\r\nbe the case, for if such a thing should occur as an air-current of\r\none velocity flowing over another of less speed, or of a current in\r\none direction over another moving in a different course, the two must\r\ninevitably mix at their junction, and in a very short time the passage\r\nfrom the lower current to the upper one would be quite gradual. No\r\ndoubt we can often observe two, three, or more layers of cloud moving\r\nin different directions; but if we were to send up a balloon, it would\r\nbe rare indeed to find its direction of horizontal movement changed in\r\na few metres of ascent. Different and distinct air-currents are often\r\ninvoked to explain cloud-forms quite unnecessarily. It is far more\r\nlikely that the differential movements involved in the explanation of\r\nthe features of these cirrus varieties are due to increased velocity\r\nwith greater altitude, to progressive change of direction, to irregular\r\neddies, or to the interaction of ascending and descending convection\r\ncurrents. Indeed, it is probable that careful study of the growth and\r\ndecay of these clouds will, in time, lead to a clearer understanding\r\nof atmospheric movements, and so enable us to say more precisely why\r\nthey are as we see them to be. The variety shown in Plate 8 is rare\r\nexcept in combination with other forms. It might well be termed tailed\r\ncirrus or cirrus caudatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 8.\r\n\r\nTAILED CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Caudatus._)]\r\n\r\nThe form of cirrus shown in Plate 9 is far more frequently seen than\r\neither of those which have been described. In this the fibrous texture\r\nis very imperfect, and the cloudlets show a tendency to arrange\r\nthemselves in a kind of ribbed structure in two directions almost at\r\nright angles to each other. But this last is an accidental feature\r\nof the particular example, and not in any way a specific character\r\nof the cloud. The reason for regarding it as a distinct variety is\r\nthe total absence of sharply defined lines, not only the heads of\r\ncondensation, but even the long streamers attached to them being\r\nuniformly hazy and ill-defined. It is a form of cirrus which comes at\r\nall seasons, but most frequently in summer; it moves always with great\r\nslowness, indicating a quiet atmosphere free from disturbance of any\r\nkind. The conditions necessary for its appearance are a nearly uniform\r\ndistribution of pressure over a considerable area, chequered by little\r\nshallow depressions of some trifling fraction of an inch. In hot\r\nweather these are the conditions under which thunder-storms develop,\r\nand this hazy cirrus, or cirrus nebulosus, may be taken as a certain\r\nsign of such an atmospheric state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 9.\r\n\r\nHAZY CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Nebulosus._)]\r\n\r\nSo far as permanency of form is considered, hazy cirrus is one of the\r\nmost persistent, and affords a marked contrast to the species shown in\r\nPlate 10, which represents the most fugitive. Five minutes before the\r\nphotograph was taken the same part of the sky was a deep, clear blue,\r\nwithout any trace of cloud. Suddenly a few short curling wisps made\r\ntheir appearance. These rapidly increased in number, until a delicate\r\nfilmy network extended over the greater part of the field of view. But\r\nwhile the camera was being adjusted for an exposure, part of the net\r\nhad broken up into the granular structure shown in the lower part of\r\nthe photograph. The granulation rapidly spread through the net, almost\r\nas if the fibres had been curdled, and five minutes later the whole had\r\nbeen converted into a patch of cirro-cumulus which soon fused into a\r\nuniform sheet. Meanwhile the same series of phenomena were taking place\r\nin other parts of the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 10.\r\n\r\nCHANGE CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Inconstans._)]\r\n\r\nOn other occasions exactly the same set of events have been seen to\r\nfollow each other in the inverse order. Beginning with a fairly even\r\nsheet, this broke up into granules, and they in turn seemed to be\r\nfrayed out into short hazy and wavy fibres which slowly melted away.\r\n\r\nClearly we have here to do, not with a distinct type of cloud, but\r\nrather with the first step towards the formation of one, or the last\r\nstage in the life of one which is drying up. But sometimes the life of\r\nthe cloud is so short that it never passes beyond this first stage;\r\nand it is by no means a universal rule for a growing sheet of cirrus\r\nto pass through this stage at all. It therefore represents a peculiar\r\nstate of instability, and requires a name of its own. Sometimes patches\r\nof it will come and go in an apparently capricious manner for an\r\nhour or more before permanent condensation is effected or before the\r\nsky finally clears. But this is a rare event, since the slow change\r\nof conditions which has brought the stratum of air to the unstable\r\ncondition is generally progressive, and instead of stopping at the\r\ncritical point, goes beyond it, with the result that the condensation\r\ngrows or the cloud disappears entirely. Change cirrus, or cirrus\r\ninconstans, would be an appropriate name for a kind of cloud which is\r\nso plainly indicative of instability.\r\n\r\nThe critical condition referred to is, of course, that in which a\r\nparticular stratum of air is just saturated, or is just on the point\r\nof forming visible cloud. If any cause is brought to bear on such a\r\nstratum which brings about even slight cooling, cloud must be produced;\r\nand, conversely, anything which results in the slightest heating must\r\ncause it to disappear. The shortness and haziness of the fibres, and\r\nthe fact that they gather themselves into granules, shows that the\r\ncloud is formed in a stratum of air which is either still, or is moving\r\nas a whole, without any of those differential movements which seem to\r\nbe necessary for the longer fibrous details.\r\n\r\nThe causes which may bring about the local cooling and heating are easy\r\nto understand when we remember how the air will be affected by the\r\nuneven contours of the ground. As it passes over hill and valley the\r\nup-and-down movements of the lower layers, or even the disturbances\r\ncaused by passing over a wood or clump of trees, all must be propagated\r\nupwards. Each disturbance must slowly spread laterally and diminish\r\nvertically, so that it will reach the cirrus zone as a broad and\r\ngentle dome-like oscillation. Suppose now a series of such slight\r\nupheavals to reach the critical level. The passage of the waves will\r\nmean alternate expansion and compression. Expansion means cooling, and\r\ntherefore cloud-production; compression means heating, and therefore\r\nthe destruction of cloud.\r\n\r\nFrom the most transient form of cirrus we pass, in Plate 11, to the\r\nmost persistent and probably the most frequent. It occurs in detached\r\nmasses which have very variable forms but are wholly fibrous, with the\r\ndetails arranged in a very irregular manner. The example figured was\r\ntaken in the evening during a long spell of fine weather. If such a\r\ncloud is watched, its permanence of detail is very striking, and must\r\nbe due to a persistence of slow eddying movements and to a continual\r\nrenewal and waste of the component particles of each wisp. This is\r\nthe kind of cirrus selected generally as the type of cirrus, and the\r\nselection is a good one. Common cirrus, or cirrus communis, it should\r\nbe called. Settled conditions and fine weather are its usual attendants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 11.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Communis._)]\r\n\r\nWe next come to a variety which is anything but a harbinger of good,\r\nnamely, the long stripes or bands of cirrus which stretch outwards\r\nfrom the margin of the cloud canopy of a cyclonic storm. In some ways\r\nthese appendages to the great nimbus resemble the strips of cirriform\r\ncloud which fringe the summit of a thunder-cloud. They look as if they\r\nmust have been formed by the blowing away, by a rapid wind, of the top\r\nof an uprising column of vapour-charged air. Their main outline may\r\nthus be easily accounted for, but we have only to study their detailed\r\nstructure for a few minutes to feel that they really present a problem\r\nof a very high order. Plate 12 shows a fairly simple example, but Plate\r\n13 represents a cloud of very great complexity. To take this last the\r\ncamera was tilted upwards at an angle of 45 degrees, so that the top of\r\nthe picture is not far from the zenith. The wonderful plume of cloud\r\nrose from the southern horizon, and ended in a great sheaf of fibres\r\nand films spread out like a partly opened fan whose edge was only about\r\n50 degrees above the northern horizon. Its length as it passed overhead\r\nlay between a point a little east of south to a little west of north;\r\nand the broad band moved as a whole, without any marked internal\r\nchanges, from the south-west towards the north-east. The weather was\r\nvery unsettled. A long procession of cyclones had been sweeping along\r\nour western shores, and the barometer was just beginning a fresh and\r\nrapid fall. During the ensuing night a heavy gale burst over the south\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 12.\r\n\r\nBAND CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Vittatus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 13.\r\n\r\nBAND CIRRUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirrus Vittatus._)]\r\n\r\nThe whole phenomenon was highly characteristic. These great bands with\r\nthe divergent striation might well be known as storm bands, from their\r\nalmost invariable connection with the violent atmospheric movements\r\nto which they are most probably due. Plate 12 shows a much less\r\ndangerous variety of the same species, which is distinguished from it\r\nby the comparative absence of internal detail and by the curled ends.\r\nClouds of this character have sometimes been called cirro-filum, but\r\na comparison of the plates with the typical cirro-filum of Plate 7\r\nwill show that there is little resemblance; and the attendant weather\r\nis also in marked contrast, both of which facts imply a fundamental\r\ndifference in the causes to which their features are due. Banded or\r\nribboned cirrus is the name which they immediately suggest, and this\r\nmay be rendered cirrus vittatus.\r\n\r\nThis ends our survey of cirrus clouds. Any one who compares the plates\r\nso far given will see that they represent forms so diverse that it is\r\nimpossible to avoid the conclusion that the conditions under which they\r\nare produced must differ not only in degree but also in kind. What\r\nthose conditions are we have attempted here and there to suggest, but\r\nin no case can we feel that the explanation has been at all complete.\r\nIn some cases, notably the last, we are face to face with such\r\ncomplicated details that it is hopeless to attempt to explain them in\r\nthe present state of our knowledge. Fact upon fact must be accumulated\r\nuntil we can give their history from their earliest beginnings; and\r\nfar more accurate and detailed knowledge of the attendant atmospheric\r\nconditions must be acquired before we can hope to rob such elaborate\r\nstructures of their present mystery.\r\n\r\nThis requires the co-operation of many eyes and many minds, and exact\r\nspecific names must be an essential preliminary. Those which have been\r\nsuggested in these pages are--\r\n\r\n  1. Cirro-nebula, or Cirrus haze.\r\n  2. Cirrus excelsus, or High cirrus.\r\n  3. Cirrus ventosus, or Windy cirrus.\r\n  4. Cirro-filum, or Thread cirrus.\r\n  5. Cirrus nebulosus, or Hazy cirrus.\r\n  6. Cirrus caudatus, or Tailed cirrus.\r\n  7. Cirrus vittatus, or Band cirrus.\r\n  8. Cirrus inconstans, or Change cirrus.\r\n  9. Cirrus communis, or Common cirrus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] The telescope with which these observations have been made is a\r\n6·8-inch refractor equatorially mounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCIRRO-STRATUS AND CIRRO-CUMULUS\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERAL of the varieties of cirrus already discussed may gather so\r\nabundantly at some given level in the atmosphere, that the most obvious\r\nfeature comes to be this arrangement in a sheet. The cloud then\r\nbecomes cirro-stratus, and should be so named. We have described how\r\ncirro-nebula frequently grows in density until it fails to produce halo\r\nphenomena, and may even reduce the sun to a hazy patch of light showing\r\nno outline. This is the most typical of all forms of cirro-stratus.\r\nIt has always a distinctly fibrous or streaky appearance, whereby it\r\nis at once distinguished from a similar but lower cloud which will be\r\ndescribed later on.\r\n\r\nA similar sheet may be formed from the fusion together of the streaks\r\nof cirrus-nebulosus, the bands of cirrus vittatus, or the development\r\nof cirrus inconstans. But the general rule is that the cirro-stratus\r\nretains more or less of the specific characters of the parent form.\r\n\r\nPlate 14 shows a hazy form of cirro-stratus developed from the nebulous\r\ncirrus. Its altitude was great, being about 10,000 metres. The\r\nprocesses of growth and change could be studied easily. First would\r\nappear some faint spots and streaks; these quickly fused together\r\ninto larger patches, which again joined to their neighbours. In a few\r\nminutes the cloud so formed would return to the mottled or streaky\r\nappearance, and either disappear entirely or become very thin, only\r\nto recommence the process. This went on for more than an hour, the\r\ncloudy patches getting larger and larger, until the critical condition\r\nwas passed, and the sky was covered with a general veil of typical\r\ncirro-stratus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 14.\r\n\r\nHAZY CIRRO-STRATUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-stratus Nebulosus._)]\r\n\r\nIn Plate 15 we have an example of a cloud which is clearly\r\ncirro-stratus, but the sheet is broken up into long bands, and each of\r\nthese is made up of common cirrus. In the upper part of the picture\r\nthe sprays of cirrus are forming, and as they come into being they\r\nare arranged in rows. We have here to do with a phenomenon of a very\r\ndifferent order from the one presented by the true banded cirrus. The\r\narrangement into belts must here be due to some kind of wave-movement\r\nin the air, breaking up the critical plane into long ribs transverse\r\nto the direction of the wave-movement. The specimen shown was moving\r\nin a direction nearly at right angles to the bands, though the surface\r\nwind was nearly parallel to their length. The question at once\r\npresented itself as to whether the movement of the bands was really a\r\ndrift of the cloud, or whether it was not a case of the propagation\r\nof cloud production with the advancing wave. This was easily answered\r\nby watching the details of a band. The advancing side was always\r\nfeathery, and careful observation showed that the edge advanced by\r\nthrowing out new threads and curls. A given thread or curl, one moment\r\nat the edge, would in a few minutes be well in the band. Quite opposite\r\nevents were taking place in the rear of each band. The cloud was there\r\nobviously melting away. Indeed, to sum the matter up, the cloud bands\r\nflowed past their details just as the waves on the sea flow past the\r\nfloating foam. Evidently we have in Plate 15 the result of a plane of\r\ncommencing cirrus formation broken into a series of troughs and waves\r\nby an undulatory movement of the air. But, as we have already said\r\nwhen speaking of cirrus inconstans, the condition in which trifling\r\nup-and-down movements can determine whether condensation shall, or\r\nshall not, take place seldom lasts long. It is usually only a stage\r\nin a continuous change, and in this particular instance the banded\r\nstructure was soon replaced by a fairly continuous sheet of typical\r\ncirro-stratus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 15.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-STRATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe next plate, No. 16, shows a similar process. In the upper part we\r\nhave cirrus inconstans forming in patches out of a deep clear-blue sky.\r\nIts hazy fibres grow closer and closer, betraying a slight tendency to\r\ngather in narrow ripple-like bands, but the structure is soon lost in\r\nthe uniform white sheet of interlacing fibres, which differ from common\r\ncirrus in little else than their number and closeness. Nevertheless,\r\nthe stratiform arrangement is quite obvious enough to warrant the use\r\nof the term “cirro-stratus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 16.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-STRATUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-stratus Communis._)]\r\n\r\nThe change of cirro-nebula into cirro-stratus is shown in Plate 4, to\r\nwhich reference has already been made. The structures are remarkably\r\ndelicate, showing in the middle a distinct irregular mottling; and\r\nrather further towards the top right-hand corner a ripple structure\r\nappears, and in the top left-hand corner the sheet is denser and\r\nwhiter. The altitude of this cloud was evidently great, and actual\r\nmeasurement showed it to be 7·6 miles. It did not last long, and after\r\nits change into broken patches of denser cirro-stratus, still higher\r\nclouds were revealed through the gaps.\r\n\r\nCirro-stratus often forms almost simultaneously at more than one level,\r\nand when that happens the full stratiform appearance is generally\r\nreached first by the lower layer. In Plate 17 we have two layers. The\r\nfluffy bits of cirrus nebulosus, in the lower part of the picture, are\r\nreally the higher clouds. Below them, probably by many thousands of\r\nfeet, floats the denser cloud shown in the upper part of the picture.\r\nThis is an interesting link between the fibrous and the granular forms\r\nof cirrus, and is probably best described as spotted cirro-stratus,\r\nor cirro-stratus maculosus. It is a form very frequently met with,\r\nbut seldom showing any persistence. It is indicative of condensation\r\nin a calm atmosphere, and not unfrequently marks either the small\r\nirregularities of pressure which form the conditions for thunderstorms,\r\nor the beginning of the break up of an anticyclone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 17.\r\n\r\nFLOCCULENT CIRRO-STRATUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-stratus Cumulosus._)]\r\n\r\nA coarser texture and greater density are shown in Plate 18, where we\r\nhave cirro-stratus in the lower part of the picture, and cirro-cumulus\r\nin the upper. The altitude of this cloud was only about 4000 metres,\r\none of the least values recorded at Exeter for cirro-stratus of any\r\nkind. The intimate admixture of the fibrous and granular forms is very\r\nclearly shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 18.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-STRATUS AND CIRRO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nThis close relation is equally obvious in Plate 19, where the cloudlets\r\nare arranged in loosely marshalled rows, dimly resembling the banded\r\nstructure of Plate 15. But in this case the direction of movement was\r\nwith the long lines, and the propagation of cloud production followed\r\nthe same course. Some of the little cloudlets have an opacity, and\r\ntherefore brilliancy, quite unusual for cirro-cumulus, but their\r\nintimate association evidently in the same plane with undoubted cirrus\r\nshows that they must fall under that general description. It is a cloud\r\nindicative of unsettled weather, and the exceptional brilliancy is\r\ndoubtless due to an unusual quantity of vapour at the cloud plane,\r\nwhich must mean that the change from the dry stratum above to the damp\r\none below must be much more sudden than is ordinarily the case. Clouds\r\nof this kind might well be called cirro-stratus cumulosus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 19.\r\n\r\nCIRRO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to two companion pictures, Plates 20 and 21, which were\r\ntaken within half a minute of each other. In the first the camera\r\nwas directed towards the west, and in the second it was facing the\r\nnorth-west. The sun was nearing the horizon, and was only just outside\r\nthe field of view in each case, so that the two photographs form\r\na panorama of the western sky. A solar halo had disappeared about\r\nhalf an hour previously, and the cirro-nebula had changed into the\r\nremarkable forms of cloud depicted. Plate 21 shows cirrus ripples in\r\nthe upper part, and cirro-cumulus in soft, ill-defined balls in the\r\nlower part; but they were at the same level, and are only different\r\nparts of the same cloud plane. In Plate 22 we see similar ball-like\r\ncloudlets ranged in long lines which run almost at right angles to\r\nthe ripples of the companion picture. Clouds like these are rare.\r\nThey are almost unknown during the early part of the day, and, so\r\nfar as the writer’s experience goes, they are only to be found in\r\nthe afternoon towards sunset. Some of our most gorgeous sunset skies\r\nare due to them; for their altitude is considerable, and they do not\r\nlight up with the sunset colours until the lower clouds have become\r\ndark shadows against the glowing background. The hottest months of the\r\nyear, the still air and great evaporation which are the contributing\r\ncauses of thunderstorms, are also the conditions under which such\r\nskies may be seen. Indeed, while these photographs were being taken,\r\nheavy thunderstorms were in progress within less than a hundred miles.\r\nCirro-cumulus nebulosus, or hazy cirro-cumulus, describes the form\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 20.\r\n\r\nHAZY CIRRO-CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-cumulus Nebulosus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 21.\r\n\r\nHAZY CIRRO-CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-cumulus Nebulosus._)]\r\n\r\nThe next plate, No. 22, gives a view of an evening sky about half an\r\nhour after sunset. The lower clouds, cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus,\r\nof a deep purple brown, standing out dark against a gold-coloured sheet\r\nof higher cirro-stratus, which comes out white in the photograph, while\r\nthe purple-tinted sky comes dark. We have here three distinct layers,\r\nall cirrus. First, the hazy cirro-cumulus, forming two bars across the\r\nlower part of the picture; then long bands of cirrus or cirro-stratus,\r\nbest seen in the bottom right-hand corner; and, far above both, the\r\ncirro-stratus which was reflecting the yellow sunlight. Such a sky\r\nmight be an indication of thunder conditions, or it might be due to an\r\nunusual quantity of vapour in the atmosphere produced by some other\r\ncause. The actual conditions were the gentle flow over England of\r\nvapour-laden air from the western ocean, heralding the change from a\r\nlong spell of fine hot weather, due to a July anticyclone, to a month\r\nof heavy rains and western gales, accompanying the passage of a long\r\nprocession of cyclones along our western shores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 22.\r\n\r\nA SUNSET SKY.]\r\n\r\nAgain, a marked contrast is shown in Plate 23. Here we have the highest\r\nand thinnest form of cirro-cumulus, the one named cirro-macula by\r\nMr. Ley. It is rarely, if ever, seen before eleven o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and is far commoner in the afternoon. The example shown was\r\nphotographed at sunset at the close of a day which had been almost\r\ncloudless. Cirro-macula forms here and there in a clear sky. A hazy,\r\nwhitish patch appears, which at first shows no definite structure, but\r\nlooks almost like a little bit of cirro-nebula. This suddenly splits\r\nup by clear blue lanes running through it, and cutting the patch up\r\ninto irregular segments, which quickly round themselves off into minute\r\nbits usually whiter on their edges and semi-transparent in the centre.\r\nThe process can be strikingly imitated by scattering on water some fine\r\npowder which will float. If left without disturbance, the particles\r\ndraw together into numerous small groups, leaving lanes of clear water\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 23.\r\n\r\nSPECKLE CLOUD (Ley).\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-macula._)]\r\n\r\nCirro-macula frequently gives rise to the fibrous form of cirrus we\r\nhave called cirrus caudatus. The granules of the cirro-macula grow\r\ndenser, and begin to drop their frozen particles as soon as they become\r\nlarge enough. Indeed, a cloudlet of cirro-macula may sometimes be seen\r\nto turn bodily into a fine line of falling crystals, which will be a\r\ncurving line of cirrus. On the other hand, it will sometimes remain\r\nvisible for an hour or more without any trace of descending streaks or\r\nfloating fibres. Pure cirro-macula such as Plate 23 is not often seen;\r\nit is far more frequently mixed with more solid-looking cloudlets and\r\ndescending fibres, such as are shown in Plate 24, which gives the same\r\npoint of view as 23, but a quarter of an hour later, and photographed\r\nwith a longer focus lens. These two photographs, together with 20 and\r\n21, give excellent examples of the use of the black mirror. In none\r\nof the four could the naked eye detect all of the cloud structures.\r\nThe whole sky was a blaze of dazzling light, but by adjusting exposure\r\nand development the details are fully brought out without the least\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 24.\r\n\r\nCIRRUS CAUDATUS AND CIRRO-MACULA.]\r\n\r\nCirro-stratus, we see from the examples which have been considered,\r\nhardly deserves to be treated as a distinct genus of cloud. Its\r\nformation is identical with that of many species of cirrus, or in some\r\ncases with that of the speckle cloud, cirro-macula, or even the coarser\r\nkinds of cirro-cumulus. The different varieties which it shows are best\r\nrendered by reference to the specific names of the detached forms which\r\nhave similar features.\r\n\r\nCirro-cumulus, on the other hand, does present clearly marked\r\nvarieties. Cirro-macula is so distinct that it might well be given\r\nthe name awarded to it by Mr. Ley, while the term “cirro-cumulus” is\r\nreserved for the coarser and rounder forms. The hazy, ripple-like\r\nstructures of Plate 4 and Plate 20 should also have some distinctive\r\nappellation, as will be suggested later on when dealing with wave\r\nclouds as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find any short way of expressing the various ideas\r\nwhich should be summed up in the name of a cloud. There seems no\r\nalternative to the use of additional words, unless it be to follow\r\nthe example of chemists, and compound appalling names similar to\r\nthose which terrify the uninitiated who think they would like to read\r\nsomething about, let us say, the coal-tar dyes.\r\n\r\nIf a cloud belongs to the order cirrus, is in a level sheet, and\r\nthat sheet is composed of interlacing or curling fibres, like those\r\nof common cirrus, we can hardly express the facts more briefly than\r\nby calling it cirro-stratus communis, or common cirro-stratus. If\r\nit consists of cirrus bands fused together, but still showing the\r\nbanded structure, it is cirro-stratus vittatus. Again, if it is finely\r\nspeckled, like cirro-macula, it may be described as cirro-stratus\r\nmaculosus, and if the structure is coarser it may be called\r\ncirro-stratus cumulosus.\r\n\r\nAs a general average, cirro-stratus lies somewhat lower in the\r\natmosphere than the detached forms, probably because the conditions\r\nwhich give rise to the latter reach to greater altitudes in patches\r\nthan it is possible for them to reach in a continuous manner. Vapour\r\nbecomes rarer with increased height and with diminished temperature,\r\nso that it must, on the whole, be less frequently present in\r\ncloud-producing quantity as the height increases. At great altitudes\r\nit will be seldom that the quantity is great enough to produce a\r\nstratiform cloud, though it may well be enough for cirro-macula, or the\r\ndetached forms of cirrus, like cirrus excelsus.\r\n\r\nThe production of cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus sometimes spreads\r\nacross the sky with astonishing speed, and this rapid advance of the\r\nedge of the cloud may lead to quite mistaken ideas as to the velocity\r\nof the wind at that altitude. In the case of cirro-cumulus, or\r\ncirro-macula, it is easy to fix attention on a single cloudlet. If this\r\nhas the usual ball-like form, it can only be regarded as floating in\r\nthe air and moving with it. Meanwhile new cloudlets may be forming and\r\ngrowing denser, so that the cloud patch as a whole may be apparently\r\nadvancing at a much greater rate. Careless observation would then lead\r\nto the idea that the cloud was moving much faster than it really is,\r\nbut if the attention is rigidly fixed on a particular cloudlet the\r\nmistake is impossible. If the cloud is a variety of cirro-stratus,\r\nit is not always easy, or even possible, to distinguish between the\r\nadvance of condensation and the movement of the whole, but it can\r\nnearly always be done if the cloud shows any definite features upon\r\nwhich attention can be fastened. Sometimes none sufficiently marked can\r\nbe seen, and when that happens it is still possible in most cases, by\r\nwatching the edge of the cloud-mass, to see whether new cloud is being\r\nadded to that edge. The wave-like forms present a special case, which\r\nwill be dealt with in a later chapter, after the general principles\r\nof cloud formation have been discussed in connection with the great\r\nclouds of the lower air, whose causes and conditions are far better\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nALTO CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus we pass through almost insensible\r\ngradations to the denser forms classed together in the alto group.\r\nThese clouds are fundamentally different, in that they are always\r\ncomposed of liquid particles, though there is no doubt, from their\r\ngreat altitude, that their temperature must often be many degrees below\r\nthe ordinary freezing-point of water. When this is the case, they\r\nare not unfrequently more or less mixed with streaks and filaments\r\nexactly like those described under the name of cirrus, which have been\r\nexplained as due to slowly falling snowflakes. It is not immediately\r\nobvious how such apparently contradictory statements can be reconciled.\r\nThe explanation is that minute droplets of water may be cooled many\r\ndegrees below freezing-point without changing into ice, and that such\r\nsuper-cooled droplets congeal instantly if a few of them join together\r\nto form a larger drop. Practically the same process may be watched any\r\nday when there is a sharp frost and dense fog drifting slowly along.\r\nThe fog-particles are liquid, and produce optical effects in the\r\nneighbourhood of any brilliant light, like an arc lamp, absolutely the\r\nsame as those which would be produced if the temperature were above\r\nfreezing-point, while there are none of the different phenomena which\r\nmight be expected if the particles were crystalline ice-dust. As these\r\nliquid particles drift along they come in contact with branches of\r\ntrees and other obstacles, the surface stratum which surrounds them and\r\nbinds them into spheres is broken, and the drop instantly solidifies.\r\nIt is to be noted, moreover, that the drop does not freeze as such,\r\nbut merely adds some more particles to the branching crystals of hoar\r\nfrost, which grow outwards always towards the direction from which the\r\nfog is drifting.\r\n\r\nMost liquids, when freed from contact with solid bodies, or when\r\nsurrounded by a smooth envelope of uniform character, can be cooled\r\nbelow their normal freezing-point without solidification taking place;\r\nbut the introduction of a particle of the solid, or sometimes of any\r\nforeign body, instantly brings about a rapid freezing of the whole.\r\nThese phenomena of surfusion, as it is called, have long been known,\r\nand many of them are very interesting and difficult to understand.\r\nIndeed, it is probable that we shall have to add largely to our\r\nknowledge of the forces which bind the molecules of a body together to\r\nform a solid, and which direct the processes of crystallization before\r\nwe shall be able to interpret with any certainty a series of facts\r\ndepending on the attributes of those very forces.\r\n\r\nWater is no exception. If finely divided, as by placing it in fine\r\ncapillary tubes, in the pores of wood, or in the narrow spaces of a\r\nwick, it may be cooled several degrees below normal freezing-point.\r\nIn a cloud, or fog, all the conditions necessary for surfusion to\r\ntake place are undoubtedly present. The water is pure, the envelope\r\nis uniform, the subdivision is exceedingly minute, and the drops are\r\nfree from most of the mechanical disturbances which bring about the\r\nsolidification of larger masses in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThus we see there is nothing at all surprising in the fact that clouds\r\ncomposed of liquid particles may exist at temperatures below the\r\nordinary freezing-point. On the contrary, we should expect that the\r\nsolidification of the cloud particles would not take place until the\r\ntemperature was many degrees below freezing, as is certainly the case\r\nwith clouds of the cirrus order. At temperatures between this unknown,\r\nbut low value, and the normal freezing-point, the clouds will be\r\ncomposed of liquid; but when the particles join together, snowflakes\r\nwill result instead of raindrops; and this will be just as true of\r\nalto clouds as it is of the great vaporous mountains of the lower\r\nregions of the air which bring falls of snow. The streaks often mixed\r\nwith alto-cumulus are cirrus threads, and are, no doubt, of exactly\r\nthe same nature as the tails of cirrus caudatus, or even the fibres of\r\ncirro-filum.\r\n\r\nThe simplest alto cloud is alto-stratus. When this is complete, so as\r\nto cover the sky, it can be distinguished from cirro-stratus by the\r\nabsence of fibrous structure, and by the facts that it never produces\r\nany halo or fragment of a halo, but instead surrounds the sun or\r\nmoon with a white blur, or, if it is thin enough, with a close ring\r\nof coloured light much nearer than a halo, and with the colours in\r\nthe inverse order--that is, with the red furthest from the centre.\r\nSome of these so-called coronæ are very beautiful when seen in the\r\nblack mirror, and some of those formed around a full moon show quite\r\nbrilliant tints to the unaided eye. Of course, these meteorological\r\ncoronæ have no relation whatever to the true solar corona; they are\r\nsimply formed by the passage of the rays of light through the veil of\r\nsmall particles, and may be easily imitated. Take a piece of glass such\r\nas a lantern-cover glass, breathe on it, and hold it close before the\r\neye while looking at some small source of light. If the dew deposit\r\nis thin, bright colours are shown in a luminous ring surrounding the\r\nlight, and the thinner the deposit of dew the larger the ring will be.\r\nBreathe heavily so as to give a thick deposit, and the light will be\r\nseen to be the centre of a patch of white brightness without any colour.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena are due to what is known as diffraction, and if the\r\nother conditions are unchanged the diameter of the ring is inversely\r\nproportional to the size of the particles. Purity of colour in these\r\nrings is an indication of uniformity in the size of the particles.\r\nWhen the moon is shining through a sheet of alto-stratus, which thins\r\noff to one edge, very beautiful effects may often be noticed, and the\r\nchange from the colourless blur, when a thicker part of the cloud\r\nis interposed, to the brilliant colours of the corona formed by the\r\nthinner edges is very striking. Similar phenomena are shown almost\r\nequally well by any of the alto clouds, but cirrus thin enough to\r\nproduce a coloured corona will generally produce a halo.\r\n\r\nAlto-cumulus of the kind most nearly allied to cirro-cumulus is shown\r\nin Plate 25. The upper part of the picture shows ragged, irregular\r\npatches, with slight indications of fibrous streaks. The lower portion\r\nshows rounder, ball-like cloudlets, a few of the larger of which have\r\ndistinct shadows on the side away from the sun. This plate gives\r\nalto-cumulus in a partly formed condition, but it is not a mere passage\r\nform. Sometimes exactly such a cloud will float overhead for hours,\r\nshowing very little movement and only slow changes of detail. It is\r\ntherefore a distinct variety, and may be called alto-cumulus informis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 25.\r\n\r\nALTO-CUMULUS INFORMIS.]\r\n\r\nA less definite form is shown in Plate 26. It may also be regarded as\r\nonly partly formed, but its construction is quite different, every part\r\nbeing misty and ill defined. It is a common cloud, especially in sultry\r\nsummer weather with still air. Under those circumstances, after a hazy\r\nmorning, it may be seen slowly forming during the afternoon, growing\r\nin density as the hours go by, until it reaches a maximum about five\r\nor six o’clock, after which it melts away, or settles down into small\r\npatches of high stratus. Most frequent in summer, it is by no means\r\nrare in autumn and winter, but still air is essential. From its hazy\r\nappearance it may be called alto-cumulus nebulosus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 26.\r\n\r\nHAZY ALTO-CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Nebulosus._)]\r\n\r\nFixity of detail and slow movement characterize both the foregoing\r\nforms, and in that respect our next picture (Plate 27) shows a cloud\r\nwhich is a great contrast. Its detached cloudlets are rather flatter\r\nand thinner, and though the cloud as a whole will often persist for\r\nhours, it is undergoing continual change, and is formed when the air\r\nis far from still. Cloudlets form and gather into stratiform patches,\r\nwhich soon break up again and disappear; and the process goes on\r\nhere and there, sometimes accompanied by fairly rapid movement of\r\nthe patches as a whole. This cloud may be described as alto-cumulus\r\nstratiformis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 27.\r\n\r\nFLAT ALTO-CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Stratiformis._)]\r\n\r\nWe now come, in Plate 28, to a cloud of singular beauty. It forms\r\nrapidly in a clear sky, its first traces bearing a striking\r\nresemblance to cirro-macula, but the floccules, instead of remaining\r\nsemi-transparent or dropping cirrus threads, rapidly become opaque\r\nballs of cloud which lengthen upwards. This upward tendency causes\r\nthe formed cloudlets to have their longer axes vertical, which is\r\nvery characteristic. It might be named alto-cumulus castellatus,\r\nor high-turreted cloud. Mr. Ley named it stratus castellatus, or\r\nturret-cloud, but it certainly belongs to the cumulus section of\r\nthe alto group. Thunder weather is the invariable condition for\r\nits production. If it is seen, at least in England, thunderstorms\r\nare certain to be recorded not very far away. When this particular\r\nphotograph was being taken in South Devon, very destructive storms were\r\nrecorded in Brittany and in the English Midlands, and the anvil-shaped\r\ntops of unmistakable thunder-clouds were visible above the horizon\r\nwhile the exposure was being made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 28.\r\n\r\nHIGH TURRETED CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Castellatus._)]\r\n\r\nAnother form of almost equal beauty is shown in Plate 29. The rounded\r\nballs make their appearance as semi-transparent spots upon the sky, and\r\nin their general characters might easily be mistaken for cirro-macula.\r\nBut a few minutes will be enough to decide the question. The little\r\nspots rapidly grow denser, frequently becoming ragged at the edges;\r\nthey never drop down the slender filaments which usually descend from\r\ncirro-macula, and their edges are never denser than their central\r\nparts, which, it will be remembered, was a frequent feature of the true\r\nspeckle cloud. The cloudlets are obviously rounded balls arranged in\r\npatches, which may turn gradually into alto-stratus by their fusion,\r\nor, after an existence of minutes or hours, the whole may disappear\r\nby a disintegration of each ball, by its breaking up into a ragged\r\nmass and melting away. The altitude at which this cloud forms is\r\nbetween 5000 and 9000 metres, according to measurements made by the\r\nwriter, the actual specimen figured being about 7000. It is almost as\r\ncharacteristic of thunder weather as the last, but whereas Plate 28\r\nshows a variety which is most often seen before 3 p.m., since it only\r\noccurs while the cloud planes are rapidly rising, the one before us\r\nmay be formed at almost any time of day, but most frequently occurs in\r\nthe afternoon. An imperfect form of it is frequently met with about\r\nsunset, in which the rounded balls are not usually so well defined as\r\nwhen the sun is high above the horizon. Alto-cumulus glomeratus would\r\nbe a suitably descriptive name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 29.\r\n\r\nHIGH BALL CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Glomeratus._)]\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to take a good typical example of the variety\r\njust described and roll it flat, so that each cloudlet should be\r\nreduced to a lenticular shape, we get a type which seems seldom to\r\nappear during the heat of the day, and to be most frequent about\r\nsundown. It consists, as shown in Plate 30, of distinct cloudlets,\r\nwith considerable spaces between them, and gives the impression of a\r\ndiscontinuous level sheet. But the component cloudlets are much too\r\ndefinite, and preserve their individuality far too well to suggest any\r\nidea of a broken stratus; the spotted structure is the predominant\r\nfeature, while the stratiform arrangement is almost equally plain.\r\nAlto-stratus maculosus would be a suitable term. It is not so high a\r\ncloud as the glomeratus type, the one shown being at an altitude of\r\nabout 5600 metres. The plate shows the position of the setting sun,\r\nwhich is partly hidden behind some dark patches of broken alto-stratus\r\n(fracto-alto-stratus), the hazy form and boundaries of which form an\r\neffective contrast to the shining cloudlets 2000 metres or so above\r\nthem. Many of our most beautiful sunsets are due to this form of cloud,\r\nparticularly in the late autumn. It is a cloud of calm weather, and\r\noften floats apparently motionless, and undergoing little change,\r\nlike flakes of glowing fire against the background of a fading sky\r\nlong after the sun has disappeared. It is not indicative of thunder\r\nconditions, and it may occur on the margins of an anticyclone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 30.\r\n\r\nMACKEREL SKY.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-stratus Maculosus._)]\r\n\r\nA lower and coarser form of the spotted alto-stratus is shown in\r\nPlate 31, where it is seen through the gaps in a thin sheet of broken\r\nstratus. In this case also the sun was getting low in the sky, being\r\nhidden by the denser bit of stratus in the bottom left-hand corner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 31.\r\n\r\nMACKEREL SKY.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-stratus Maculosus._)]\r\n\r\nAlto-stratus does not often, if ever, grow from the fusion of the\r\ncloudlets of the maculosus type. But it does come from alto-cumulus\r\nglomeratus, and also from a form shown in Plate 32. Here we have\r\nalto-stratus in process of growth. Small irregular lumps of cloud\r\nforming on the right-hand side of the picture grow larger and more\r\nirregular, begin to fuse together towards the centre, and on the\r\nleft-hand side the fusion is almost complete. Still, although the\r\nsky is covered with cloud, the lumpy form is plainly visible. The\r\nterm “alto-strato-cumulus” is suitable, as it differs from the more\r\nfrequent and much lower cloud, which will be described further on as\r\nstrato-cumulus, in little else than altitude and general massiveness\r\nof texture. This high strato-cumulus is common enough, too common,\r\nindeed, in England, as it produces many a dull grey sky both in summer\r\nand in winter. In the latter season it is not unfrequent with the cold\r\neast winds of February and March. It is probably the lowest of the alto\r\nclouds; the lowest measurement made by the writer being 1828 metres at\r\nExeter, but lower altitudes seem to have been recorded elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 32.\r\n\r\nALTO-STRATO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nAlto-cumulus castellatus, which is breaking up and disappearing, is\r\nshown in Plate 33. It was photographed with a long-focus lens, so that\r\nthe scale of representation is about eight times as great as that of\r\nPlate 27. This view was taken at Exeter while a thunderstorm was in\r\nprogress at Bristol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 33.\r\n\r\nSUNSET.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Castellatus Fractus._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLOWER CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE clouds of the lower portions of the atmosphere are formed in\r\nregions where water vapour is abundant, and frequently in easy reach\r\nof the strong ascending and descending air currents produced by the\r\nvarying temperatures and irregular surface of the ground. It is\r\nsufficient to recite these conditions to show that these lower clouds\r\nwill be denser, larger, coarser in texture, and characterized by\r\ngreater definiteness of form than those we have, so far, considered.\r\n\r\nIn the International system they are classified thus--\r\n\r\n  Group C. Lower clouds.\r\n    (_a_) Strato-cumulus.\r\n    (_b_) Nimbus.\r\n  Group D. Clouds of diurnal ascending currents.\r\n    Cumulus and cumulo-nimbus.\r\n  Group E. High fogs.\r\n    Stratus.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly the least satisfactory part of the whole scheme,\r\nand it is not at all easy to see upon what grounds it was adopted by\r\nthe International Committee. Group D--cumulus and cumulo-nimbus--do\r\nshow important differences from the other groups, though it is often\r\ndifficult to say whether the sky should be described as covered with\r\nstrato-cumulus or as covered with numerous small cumulus. It is the\r\nseparation of stratus--placing it in a group by itself, and making that\r\nthe lowest--which is the worst point. As a matter of fact, stratus\r\nmay exist at any altitude from sea-level up to such heights that we\r\nshould not hesitate to call it alto-stratus. Indeed, there is no\r\nessential character of alto-stratus which distinguishes it from some\r\nof the lower forms. Whatever its altitude, its thickness and the size\r\nof its particles may vary in a precisely similar manner. We may have\r\nthe particles exceedingly small, when the fog will be dry, and such a\r\nstratus may be so thin as hardly to dim the sun; or it may be so thick\r\nas to completely hide it. On the other hand, the fog may consist of\r\nparticles easily visible to the naked eye, forming the so-called Scotch\r\nmist, or the “dry” fog of Dartmoor, which will wet things as rapidly\r\nand more thoroughly than a smart shower. When such a fog accumulates\r\nto a sufficient depth, the particles in their fall pick up others, and\r\nthe result is a distinct fine rain. This may occur not only near the\r\nground, but at almost any level below that at which the cloud would\r\npass into the region of cirrus.\r\n\r\nPlate 34 shows three layers of stratus, in each case much broken up.\r\nThe highest layer is a good example of alto-stratus maculosus. Lower\r\ndown, by half a mile or more, come parts of a grey sheet considerably\r\ndenser and thicker. It is a matter of taste whether this should be\r\ncalled high stratus or low alto-stratus. There is no test by which\r\nthe one can be distinguished from the other. Lower again come the\r\ndetached darker clouds, which are fragments of a sheet of stratus\r\nwhich is breaking up and disappearing. The photograph was taken in the\r\nafternoon, after a wet morning, and all three layers were probably\r\nrelics of the great rain-cloud system, or nimbus, which produced the\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 34.\r\n\r\nTHREE LAYERS OF STRATIFORM CLOUD AFTER RAIN.]\r\n\r\nWe have referred to the production of fine rain from a thick fog. If\r\nnow such a thick layer of coarse-grained fog--if we may use such a\r\nphrase--is suspended overhead at a moderate altitude, the result is\r\na drizzling rain underneath, and the cloud at once becomes a nimbus.\r\nWhen Luke Howard adopted the term “nimbus,” he proposed to employ it,\r\napparently, for a vast mass of cloud such as that which forms the rainy\r\nregion of a cyclone; a huge pile of clouds containing representatives\r\nof all his other types in some unknown but close relationship. It was,\r\nin fact, a comprehensive term, and as such there was a good use for\r\nit. At present it is applied to any cloud from which rain is falling,\r\nexcept when the cloud can be identified as a variety of cumulus which\r\nis called cumulo-nimbus. But we have already said that a stratus may be\r\na rain-cloud, and so may other varieties. Moreover, whenever a nimbus\r\nbreaks sufficiently for us to be able to see its upper surface, we\r\ninvariably find that, if it were viewed from above, we should, without\r\na moment’s hesitation, place it in one of the other groups. It is only\r\nwhen we are underneath it we can see its rain-producing character, and\r\ngive it the orthodox name. The real fact is that nimbus should be an\r\nadjective, meaning rain-producing, and not a substantive.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has its allotted place in the International system, and\r\nit is better to adhere as far as possible to a defective but widely\r\nrecognized system until it can be authoritatively amended, rather than\r\nto make an individual attempt to ignore it. The facts are sufficiently\r\nobvious, and the days of nimbus as a type are numbered. The two plates,\r\nNos. 35 and 36, are fair typical representations of the clouds usually\r\nknown as nimbus; but they are both of them only the under-surfaces of\r\nother clouds, Plate 36 showing the under-surfaces of a group of heavy\r\ncumulo-nimbus all joined together so as to cover the sky, while Plate\r\n35 shows a mass of dense strato-cumulus. The rain-cloud is always\r\na form of either stratus or cumulus, or a combination of the two,\r\nsometimes in further combination with clouds of the alto class, or even\r\nextending upwards to cirro-stratus and cirro-nebula. Where it consists\r\nof a single layer, that layer differs from its rainless representative\r\nonly in greater thickness from base to summit, or in greater density;\r\nand when there are several distinct layers of cloud, so that the\r\nlowest is shaded by the higher, rain may fall, even though they differ\r\nin no visible way from clouds which would be rainless if alone. Plate\r\n33 is an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 35.\r\n\r\nRAIN-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Nimbus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 36.\r\n\r\nRAIN-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Nimbus._)]\r\n\r\nNimbus, indeed, is not a type-form, but is merely a typical condition,\r\nand when used as a substantive is only a convenient way of expressing\r\nour ignorance as to the real form of the cloud we so describe.\r\n\r\nThe altitude of the base of a rain-cloud may vary considerably. It\r\nmay be anything from sea-level up to heights which vary with the\r\ngeographical conditions and with the conditions of temperature and\r\npressure, but probably in this country never greater than 7000 or 8000\r\nmetres.\r\n\r\nRain, or snow, often falls from clouds at greater altitudes than these,\r\nbut unless in its descent it passes through other lower clouds, the\r\ndrops, as a rule, will dry up and disappear. The author has often seen\r\nquite heavy rain descending from a cloud, and disappearing completely\r\nwithin a thousand feet or so of the cloud-base. On rarer occasions a\r\nstill more remarkable thing may be seen--namely, a shower falling from\r\nan upper cloud into a lower, and none between this lower cloud and the\r\nground. This curious phenomenon can only be explained by supposing\r\nthat the convection currents which make the lower cloud are strong\r\nenough to support the small raindrops.\r\n\r\nPure stratus is a level sheet of cloud with little variation of\r\nthickness, not ascending every here and there into rounded lumps. Its\r\nmost typical form covers the whole sky with a uniform grey pall, which\r\nmay or may not completely hide the sun. Such a cloud does not lend\r\nitself to pictorial representation. A frequent form, in which the sheet\r\nis more or less broken, is shown in Plate 37. This is a variety which\r\nis frequent in the summer mornings, and generally breaks up and clears\r\naway before eleven o’clock. If, however, it appears in autumn and\r\nwinter with layers of alto cloud above, it may grow denser, and turn\r\ninto a stratiform nimbus, or it may go on drifting overhead for several\r\ndays without sign of change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 37.\r\n\r\nSTRATUS COMMUNIS.]\r\n\r\nBreak up such a sheet of cloud by numerous meandering cracks, and round\r\noff the detached pieces so as to give them a more or less rounded\r\nor pyramidal section, and the cloud becomes strato-cumulus, typical\r\nrepresentations of which are shown in Plates 38 and 39, which depict\r\ndifferent parts of the same sky. In Plate 38 the camera was pointed due\r\nwest, and in Plate 39 it was turned round to the north-west, so that\r\nthe two views do not quite meet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 38.\r\n\r\nSTRATO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 39.\r\n\r\nSTRATO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nPlate 40 is a different variety. It is stratiform, each component\r\ncloudlet being rather ragged at the edges. In some ways it resembles\r\ncirro-macula and the speckled varieties of alto cloud, but it\r\nis coarser in texture and obviously at no great altitude. The\r\nInternational system would call it strato-cumulus, but Mr. Ley gives\r\na representation from another negative taken at the same time as the\r\ntype of what he calls stratus maculosus, a name which seems far more\r\nsuitable, since the cloud bears a much closer relation to stratus than\r\nto cumulus. In the particular instance figured, the broken structure\r\ndid not last long; the spaces gradually closed in, and a complete\r\nstratus was the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 40.\r\n\r\nSTRATUS MACULOSUS.]\r\n\r\nStrato-cumulus often lasts for hours, with little or no perceptible\r\nchange, but stratus maculosus rarely persists for more than half an\r\nhour. The first is a cloud of fairly stable conditions, the latter\r\nis dependent for its existence upon the near approach to critical\r\nconditions at one particular level, and, as we have said in other\r\ncases, such a critical state is almost always soon passed, with the\r\nresult that the cloud either masses into a denser form, or else breaks\r\nup and disappears. If the up and down currents are strong enough to\r\npersist, the result will be strato-cumulus and not stratus maculosus.\r\n\r\nA kind of stratus which is frequently seen in the daytime is shown\r\nin Plate 41. This is literally a lifted fog, having been formed\r\nabout midday, after ground fog in the early morning. It would be\r\ncalled common stratus, or stratus communis. When it appears it is a\r\nfairly persistent form, sometimes breaking up or swelling up into\r\nstrato-cumulus, but more often splitting into long rolls of cloud,\r\nwith margins like those of cumulus. This phenomenon is shown in Plate\r\n42, which was taken in December at 11 a.m., on a day which opened\r\nwith a thick ground fog. A precisely similar cloud is frequent in the\r\nearly hours of a summer morning, as a stage in the dispersal of a\r\nradiation ground fog. The fog first lifts from the ground, until it\r\nreaches a height of a few hundred metres, when it splits into the long\r\nrolls whose axes are at right angles to the direction of drift. The\r\nconsequence is very strange if you stand on a hilltop close under the\r\ndrifting mass, and look towards the horizon in the direction of drift.\r\nThe changing shadows give the impression that the clouds are actually\r\nrolling along, though of course no such thing is really taking place.\r\nAs time goes on the rolls grow larger and the interspaces wider; then\r\ntransverse fissures appear, and gradually the rolls break up into small\r\ndetached cumulus. Cumulus radius, from the Latin for a rolling-pin,\r\nmight be a suitably descriptive name, but it should not be forgotten\r\nthat it is only an intermediate link between stratus and cumulus,\r\nand, indeed, is more nearly related to the former, since it is never\r\nproduced except on the break up of stratus, while it may dry up and\r\ndisappear without reaching the cumulus stage at all. Stratus radius\r\nwould therefore be a better name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 41.\r\n\r\nCOMMON STRATUS.\r\n\r\n(_Stratus Communis._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 42.\r\n\r\nROLLER CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Stratus Radius._)]\r\n\r\nCumulus is closely related to another form of stratus, which Mr. Ley\r\nhas named stratus lenticularis, but this appears to be so frequently\r\nthe last stage in a disappearing cumulus that its history will come\r\nbetter later on. It is mentioned here as it is, after all, one of\r\nthe commonest of all forms of stratus, the form which appears at,\r\nor after, sunset, and is one of the few clouds which have an English\r\npopular name--Fall cloud. Plate 47 gives a representation of it,\r\nstanding out dark against an evening sky, with a sheet of alto-stratus\r\nfar above it in the upper part of the photograph.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, we have among the lower clouds of more or less\r\nstratiform pattern--\r\n\r\nStratus communis, or Common stratus.\r\n\r\nStratus lenticularis, the Fall cloud.\r\n\r\nStratus radius, or Roll cloud.\r\n\r\nStratus maculosus, or Mottled stratus.\r\n\r\nStrato-cumulus, or Sheet cumulus.\r\n\r\nThe last leads naturally to the consideration of cumulus and\r\ncumulo-nimbus, while the term “nimbus” does not belong to any one\r\ntype-form, but sometimes to one, sometimes to another, and generally to\r\na mixture of two or more.\r\n\r\nA good many years ago the writer made a series of measurements of\r\nthe thickness of detached clouds of the stratus and cumulus types,\r\nsuch as those which may produce a shower. The conclusions reached in\r\nconsequence of those determinations have since been amply confirmed\r\nby subsequent observations. In winter no rain will fall from a\r\ncloud unless it reaches a minimum thickness of at least 100 metres,\r\nwhile in summer it must have rather greater thickness. There is one\r\nexception, and that is in winter, when the temperature is so low that\r\nthe drop starts on its downward journey as a flake of snow. When this\r\nis the case, rain may fall from a layer of thin lifted fog, not quite\r\nthick enough to hide the blue colour of the sky. But under ordinary\r\nconditions of temperature, if the cloud has a thickness less than 2000\r\nfeet, or 616 metres, rain is unlikely, but if it does come, the drops\r\nwill be small and the fall of rain quite trifling.\r\n\r\nAbove this thickness the heaviness of the rain and size of the drops\r\nincreases, so that if the distance from base to summit be between\r\n2000 and 3000 feet, or 600 to 1000 metres, the fall will be gentle. A\r\nthickness of 4000 to 6000 feet, or 1200 to 1800 metres, gives large\r\ndrops and a fairly heavy shower, while, in summer time at least,\r\ncold heavy rain and hail come from clouds measuring 6000 to 10,000\r\nfeet, or in round numbers 1800 to 3000 metres or more. In winter the\r\nnecessary dimensions seem to be less, but the rule still holds equally\r\ngood, that the rain-cloud does not necessarily differ in any way from\r\nthe rainless one, except in thickness, and that when the requisite\r\nthickness is present rain is not always the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCUMULUS\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER the general term cumulus there are grouped the most common, the\r\nbest known, and the grandest forms of cloud. Indeed, beautiful as the\r\ncirrus and alto clouds may be, there is a solid grandeur about the\r\ngreater forms of cumulus which gives them a beauty of their own quite\r\ncomparable with the charm afforded by the delicate tracery of their\r\nmore lofty rivals.\r\n\r\nCumulus can be divided into several types, which are best considered\r\nin the order of growth. They are all formed in the lower part of the\r\natmosphere, their under-surfaces varying in altitude from about 600\r\nmetres, or even less, up to 3000 metres, or slightly more. The writer’s\r\nown measurements vary from a minimum of 584 metres to a maximum of 2286\r\nmetres, with an average of a little more than 1000 metres.\r\n\r\nThey are described in the International system as “clouds in a rising\r\ncurrent,” and there is no doubt the description is correct. Each\r\ncumulus must be looked upon as simply the visible top of an ascending\r\npillar of damp air. The vapour which makes its appearance in the cloud\r\nis present in the transparent air beneath, and the base of the cloud\r\nis simply the level at which that vapour begins to condense into\r\nvisible liquid particles. Since cumulus clouds are caused by ascending\r\ncurrents, these currents must be brought about either by the general\r\ndisturbance of the air due to a cyclonic movement, or by the local\r\nirregularities of temperature on the ground produced by the sun’s heat.\r\nAs a matter of fact, we do get cumulus produced in great abundance in\r\nthe rear of every cyclone, and we get them also under the conditions\r\nof still air and hot sun, which specially favour evaporation and the\r\ndevelopment of differences of temperature. The cyclone cumulus may come\r\nat any hour of the day or night, though comparatively rare between\r\nmidnight and the morning. Heat cumulus is generally formed during the\r\nafternoon, and it is only under relatively uncommon conditions that it\r\npersists during the night. If the cloud has not grown to very great\r\nsize it usually begins to break up and disappear about sunset, but\r\nif it has grown to the enormous dimensions of a summer thunder-cloud\r\nit may go on growing, piling mass on to mass, until it generates a\r\nthunderstorm, even in the hours of early morning.\r\n\r\nIn the case of some of the higher kinds of cloud, we are not able to\r\ngive any certain account of the mechanics of their production from a\r\nstudy of those clouds themselves. We have already referred incidentally\r\nto some of the speculations as to their origin and some of the facts\r\ndefinitely known, but considerable light can be thrown on the genesis\r\nof all the varieties of cirro-cumulus and alto-cumulus by a careful\r\nstudy of their larger and more accessible representatives of lower\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone cumulus does not differ in any essential from the clouds\r\nof calm weather. The only difference is that the uprising currents are\r\nperhaps partly eddies, and the rate of fall of temperature with ascent\r\nis often more rapid.\r\n\r\nGiven any mass of air at a particular temperature, it can take up and\r\nhold in the form of invisible vapour a fixed quantity of water, and no\r\nmore. When it holds the maximum possible it is said to be saturated. If\r\nit is nearly saturated it would be called damp; if far from saturated,\r\ndry. Now, the warmer the air the larger the quantity of vapour\r\nnecessary to saturate it, so that if a quantity is saturated at a high\r\ntemperature, and is then cooled, it will no longer be able to retain\r\nall its moisture in the invisible form, but the surplus quantity will\r\nmake its appearance as liquid particles, that is to say, as mist or\r\ncloud.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a quantity of air is not fully saturated at its\r\nparticular temperature, and is then cooled, it will approach nearer and\r\nnearer to saturation, and if the process is continued long enough the\r\nresult will be cloud formation.\r\n\r\nAll clouds, without exception, are produced by exactly such cooling\r\nof air containing water vapour, first to the temperature at which the\r\nquantity it contains is the maximum possible, and then beyond that\r\npoint. Now, if we start with very warm air, and cool it 1 degree, we\r\ndecrease its vapour-holding power, and the decrease per degree grows\r\nless and less as the temperature falls. Suppose, for instance, we have\r\nair saturated at 61 degrees and cool it to 60 degrees, the quantity\r\nof vapour condensed will be equal to the difference of holding power.\r\nSuppose, again, we have air saturated at 31 degrees and we cool it to\r\n30 degrees, the quantity of vapour condensed will again be equal to the\r\ndifference of holding power; but this quantity will be very greatly\r\nless than in the former case. Cooling air saturated at 61 degrees to 60\r\ndegrees might produce a dense cloud; but applying a similar reduction\r\nof 1 degree to air saturated at 31 degrees, if we take the same volume\r\nof air, will only produce a very much thinner result. Here we see one\r\ngood reason why the highest clouds are the thinnest and the alto clouds\r\nof intermediate density.\r\n\r\nThe necessary cooling may be brought about in several ways. Firstly,\r\nthe air is capable of radiating its heat into space, and therefore\r\nof cooling. But we know little of the laws which govern atmospheric\r\nradiation, and presumably, if cloud could be produced by such means,\r\nit ought to make its appearance most frequently in the small hours of\r\nthe morning before sunrise. We are, however, unaware of any variety\r\nof cloud which answers those conditions, unless it be the ground\r\nfogs which so often form during the night; and these, we know, are\r\ncertainly due to the chilling of the air by contact with the ground,\r\nwhich has been cooled by radiating away its heat. On the contrary, it\r\nis well known to astronomers that the sky is, on the whole, clearer\r\nand freer from clouds after midnight than in the earlier hours of the\r\nnight--a circumstance which is particularly unfortunate for the amateur\r\nstar-gazer, who has to be up and about at the same time as the rest of\r\nthe working world. Cooling by radiation we may then dismiss as a cause\r\nof cloud formation of no great efficacy, and certainly one which has\r\nlittle to do with the production of cumulus.\r\n\r\nCooling by contact with a cold body is another and more potent cause.\r\nWe often see it in a mountain district, where a frost-bound peak\r\nstands facing the wind with glittering snow-slopes on which the sun\r\nis shining, while a long tongue of cloud hangs like a banner on its\r\nleeward side. In such a case it is easy to understand how the air\r\nsweeping by the icy mass is chilled below its saturation point; but as\r\nit passes on, the chilled portions become mixed with the rest, and the\r\ncloud evaporates again. It is not quite so easy to see how far this\r\ncause is responsible for the clouds which are formed when the warm damp\r\nair of the ocean drifts over a comparatively cold land. It is probable\r\nthat the contact chilling is in this case only part of the explanation,\r\nand that other causes co-operate.\r\n\r\nThe mixing of warm damp air with cold has often been adduced as a cause\r\nof clouds. No doubt it might be, and some of the stratiform types may\r\npossibly be formed at the junction between a warm damp stratum of air\r\nand a cold one, but no example is certainly known. It may also be a\r\ncontributing cause in producing the sharply defined upper surfaces of\r\nsome cumulus or strato-cumulus clouds, but these are in the main most\r\ncertainly due to the chief cause of cloud production--namely, what is\r\nknown as dynamic cooling.\r\n\r\nIf a quantity of air exists under a certain pressure and at a certain\r\ntemperature, on reducing the pressure it will expand, and in the act of\r\nexpanding it will become cooler. This may easily be illustrated with\r\nan air-pump. Let a damp sponge or a piece of wet blotting-paper stand\r\nunder a glass receiver over an air-pump until the air has become damp.\r\nIf the apparatus is in a darkened room, and a powerful beam of light\r\nfrom a lantern is sent through the receiver, the damp air will be seen\r\nto be quite clear; but a stroke or two of the pump removes some of the\r\nair, the remainder is chilled by its own expansion, and a dense cloud\r\nis precipitated. If this cloud be viewed closely, it will be seen to\r\nbe composed of minute particles, which, on looking towards the light,\r\nglow with the colours of a corona. In a few minutes the cloud will\r\ndisappear, but it can be recalled again and again by successive strokes\r\nof the pump, getting thinner and thinner as the air gets more and more\r\nrarefied; an illustration of a second reason why the high clouds are\r\nthinner than the lower.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Mr. John Aitken showed that if the damp air used in\r\nthis experiment were carefully filtered, so as to remove all foreign\r\nparticles, no cloud was produced, and the introduction of a puff of\r\nunfiltered air was attended by immediate condensation. The deduction\r\nwas that vapour, even below its saturation temperature, cannot produce\r\ncloud unless nuclei of some sort are already present, presumably dust\r\nparticles. Later on it was shown by Mr. Shelford Bidwell and others\r\nthat gaseous particles, such as those produced by the burning of\r\nsulphur, would serve the purpose, and that the brush discharge from an\r\nelectrified point was in some mysterious way particularly effective.\r\nIt has recently been shown by Mr. C. T. R. Wilson that causes such as\r\nthe radiations of radium, or the impact of ultra-violet rays, acting on\r\nthe air itself, splits up some of its particles into the smaller bodies\r\nknown as ions, and that these are efficient nuclei. These experiments\r\nopen up many most interesting questions, but, unless it is to explain\r\nthe extreme density and darkness of a thunder-cloud, they do not seem\r\nto play any important part in determining the forms to be assumed.\r\nNuclei in sufficient abundance are probably always present at any\r\nheight which can be reached by enough vapour to form a cloud.\r\n\r\nNow, if we have a quantity of air, say at sea-level, damp but not\r\nsaturated, and it is caused to ascend, either because it is warmer and\r\ntherefore lighter than the surrounding air, or for some other reason,\r\nas it moves upwards the pressure upon it will decrease, it will\r\nexpand, and in the act it will be steadily cooled. This cooling may\r\nafter a time bring it down to the same temperature as the rest of the\r\nair at its particular level. If so, it will no longer be lighter, and\r\nthe ascent will come to an end. But before this state of affairs is\r\nattained it may have reached its saturation point, and cloud production\r\nwill begin.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the rarefaction of the air tends to enable it to retain\r\nmore vapour than it could if it were cooled without change of density.\r\nThe temperature of the air being fixed, its holding power increases\r\nwith decrease of pressure. But this increase is much less than the\r\ndiminution due to cooling, and the result in nature must be similar to\r\nwhat we can see happen under the receiver of the air-pump.\r\n\r\nThe condensation of water introduces another factor of great\r\nimportance. It has just been said that the ascending air may be cooled\r\nso rapidly as to be reduced to the same temperature as the rest of\r\nthe air at that level, and if so the ascent will end. Clearly the\r\ncessation or persistence of the upward motion depends upon whether the\r\ndiminution of temperature per 100 metres of ascent is most rapid in\r\nthe rising column or in the air outside it. As long as the ascending\r\nair is warmer than that outside, but at its own level, so long will\r\nascent continue. Now, as long as no condensation was taking place, the\r\nrate of cooling would follow a simple law which produces a cooling of\r\n1 degree for about 100 metres of ascent; but as soon as water vapour\r\nbegins to pass into the liquid form, a large quantity of heat is set\r\nfree, and the rate of cooling is consequently greatly lessened. Cloud\r\nproduction tends, therefore, to accelerate ascent, and the greater the\r\namount of condensation, the more important will this consideration\r\nbecome; though, on the other hand, when once the cloud is formed, it\r\ntends to stop the rising current by shading the air and ground beneath\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn an ordinary day the rate of decrease of temperature as we ascend is\r\nrather less than the value given above, and uprising currents are soon\r\nchecked. If they do extend far enough to reach cloud production, the\r\nclouds will be small, forming the smallest variety of cumulus. This is\r\nshown in Plate 43. Small irregular uprising currents have just been\r\nable to reach far enough up to have their summits tipped with cloud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 43.\r\n\r\nSMALL CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulus Minor._)]\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing explanation, it is easy to see why at a given time\r\nthe floating cloudlets should have a common base level. This is the\r\nheight to which the air must attain before reaching its saturation\r\ntemperature. Each cloudlet marks an uprising current, and the intervals\r\nshow the position of the counterbalancing descending streams.\r\n\r\nA larger variety is shown in Plate 44. In this the level base and\r\ngenerally pyramidal shape is shown, and also the hard, rounded upper\r\nsurface. The thickness of this cloud was about 500 metres. When clouds\r\nlike these are visible, they may be the beginning of larger ones, and\r\nthe only way to judge whether they are likely to develop into rain- or\r\nshower-clouds is to watch them. If they are seen to be growing larger,\r\nand particularly if detached fragments are developing into clouds,\r\nfurther growth is almost certain, and rain is probable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 44.\r\n\r\nCUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nIf great towering masses are making their appearance with little dark\r\nfragments between them, as shown in Plate 45, then smart showers may\r\nbe confidently expected. The cloud figured was a shower-cloud, and\r\nthe distance is seen through the veil of falling rain. The height\r\nand thickness of this particular cloud were measured just after its\r\nphotograph had been taken. Its base was 1200 metres above the ground,\r\nand its summit was 1500 metres further. Its thickness from summit to\r\nbase was, therefore, not much short of a mile, and the total contents\r\nof the cloud were probably between one and a half and two cubic miles.\r\nThe upper contour is hard and rounded, as in the smaller cloud of Plate\r\n44, but the whole cloud is much larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 45.\r\n\r\nLARGE CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulus Major._)]\r\n\r\nWe have already explained that there seems to be a definite connection\r\nbetween the thickness of such clouds and the amount of precipitation\r\nfrom them. Small cumulus, less than 120 metres thick, rarely produces\r\nrain, and nothing like a heavy shower is likely unless the thickness\r\nexceeds 400 metres. In winter, especially in hard frost, snow crystals\r\nmay fall from the smallest cloud, even from little fragments only a\r\nfew metres thick, but the quantity of water so precipitated will, of\r\ncourse, be small.\r\n\r\nAs long as the top of the cumulus is rounded and clearly defined,\r\nthe conditions of aërial equilibrium are stable, and the growth of\r\nthe cloud has been brought to an end by a stoppage of the ascending\r\ncurrent. In Plate 45 the ascent has been hindered both by the\r\nmechanical action of the falling raindrops and by the cooling of the\r\nlower parts of the ascending column by the descent into it of the cool\r\ndrops from its colder upper part. This is probably one of the chief\r\nreasons why a shower-cloud never maintains its activity as a rain\r\nproducer for more than a very limited period. As the cloud drifts over\r\nthe landscape, it seldom maintains its showery character for more than\r\nten or twenty miles, often for much less.\r\n\r\nCumulus, like any of these three, is a cloud of the daytime. It\r\ngenerally begins about ten or eleven o’clock in the morning, grows\r\nlarger until about four o’clock, and then begins to break up and\r\ndisappear. After the ascending currents have ceased, the component\r\ncloud particles slowly settle down into the warmer air beneath,\r\nuntil the mass has lost its proper pyramidal form, and has become\r\nan irregular cloud, such as is shown in Plate 46. This is known as\r\ndegraded or fracto-cumulus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 46.\r\n\r\nFRACTO-CUMULUS.]\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the arrest of the uprising currents is the\r\nformation of lenticular patches of stratus, called by Mr. Ley stratus\r\nlenticularis. This is often formed about sunset, and has been named\r\nfall cloud, from its appearance at the fall of night. The name is\r\nappropriate in another way. The ascending currents having ceased,\r\nthe cloud particles slowly subside until they dry up in some warmer\r\nstratum. The water vapour does not continue its descent, but slowly\r\ndiffuses in all directions, and if the fall of cloud particles is\r\nsufficient, this stratum, which is approximately coincident with the\r\nbase of the original cumulus, soon becomes saturated, and further\r\nparticles which fall into it remain visible. This saturated zone will\r\nslowly sink lower and lower with the descent of the particles, until it\r\nreaches regions in which the temperature is high enough for the whole\r\nto be evaporated without reaching saturation point. Evening stratus in\r\ncalm weather always goes through this sequence of changes. It usually\r\nforms at, or soon after, sundown, and begins to break up and disappear\r\nas the stars are becoming visible in the darkening sky. Plate 47 shows\r\na specimen of this evening stratus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 47.\r\n\r\nFALL CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Stratus Lenticularis._)]\r\n\r\nA curious feature is sometimes shown on the underside of a thick cloud,\r\nwhich is probably due to the upper part of the ascending column having\r\nbeen carried beyond its position of equilibrium by its own inertia,\r\nand then falling back again in the teeth of the still rising lower\r\npart. The result is to give the base of the cloud an appearance of\r\na number of rounded masses hanging downwards below the cloud, very\r\nsuggestive of the idea that the cloud is upside down. Such an event\r\nwill not often occur, and when it does the conditions are quite wanting\r\nin stability, and the consequent features will be very transient. When\r\nthe base of a cumulus or cumulo-nimbus is so affected, the cloud is\r\nknown as festooned cumulus, or cumulus mammatus. A precisely similar\r\nstructure may be seen under strato-cumulus, or even thick stratus. In\r\nsome countries it seems to be frequently observed, but in England it is\r\nso uncommon that the writer has only noted it about a dozen times in\r\ntwenty years, and on no one of these did it last long enough to allow\r\nof its portrait being taken. It is an indication of very disturbed\r\nconditions, and is usually followed by heavy rain.\r\n\r\nWhen cumulus clouds are formed in air which is steadily moving as\r\na whole, that is to say, when there is a steady breeze, they have\r\na very decided tendency to follow each other in long lines. It may\r\noften be noticed that in a particular place with a certain direction\r\nof wind these long processions follow definite tracks in relation to\r\nthe geographical features. The phenomenon does not seem to have been\r\nrecorded except in hilly country, but has frequently been observed by\r\nthe writer. It is not the same thing as the formation of stationary\r\nbelts of cloud transverse to the wind. These cumulus float along with\r\nthe movement of the air, and the question to be answered is, why should\r\nthey follow each other so persistently, and why should the intervening\r\nbelts of sky be so continuously free from cloud.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that the warm damp air which supplies them is drawn\r\nfrom the ground, it seems that any cause which tends to direct this\r\nwarm stratum into definite channels, as it is carried on by the wind,\r\nwill be a competent cause of the whole phenomenon. This we find in\r\nthe presence of lofty hills which stand in the way of the warm\r\nsurface winds, causing them to follow more or less the general trend\r\nof the valleys, and so delivering the rising convection currents of\r\ncloud-producing air at the same spot.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive that other causes, such as a difference in\r\ntemperature or dampness of neighbouring tracts, resulting from whether\r\nthey are bare or wooded, marshland or sandy plain, might equally\r\nsuffice; or might, at least, powerfully co-operate with, or counteract,\r\nthe effect of hill and vale. But in any case it is plain that the\r\ngeographical conditions to the windward of the place of observation not\r\nonly may affect the occurrence and distribution of cloud, but if the\r\nwind is steady it is difficult to see how they could avoid affecting it.\r\n\r\nAnother puzzling phenomenon, sometimes presented by cloud and fog, is\r\nthat our instruments for detecting humidity show that the air within\r\nthem is not always fully saturated. It seems probable that this is due\r\nto such cloud or fog having begun the process of drying up, or that\r\nin some way not fully understood the presence of the cloud particles\r\nafter they have first come into existence may cause the withdrawal of\r\nsome of the moisture from the intervening damp air. The surface of\r\neach minute droplet exerts a pressure on its interior similar to the\r\npressure exerted by the film of a soap-bubble on the air within it,\r\nand it is conceivable that some of the uncondensed vapour from outside\r\nmay diffuse through this enclosing surface film, and be retained\r\nthere in consequence of the pressure. If this is so, and subsequent\r\ninvestigation can alone decide the matter, it will follow that when\r\nonce cloud production has begun it will be continued until the air\r\nbetween the cloud particles is reduced so far below its saturation\r\npoint that the tendency of the drops to evaporate, that is to say, for\r\nthe imprisoned water to escape through the confining film, balances the\r\nretaining pressure.\r\n\r\nThis consideration, however, is quite incompetent to affect the general\r\nexplanation of cloud formation which has been given. Its result would\r\nbe to carry condensation a little further than the exact saturation\r\npoint, and to retard equally slightly the subsequent evaporation of the\r\ncloud particles.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the typical cumulus as having a roughly pyramidal\r\nshape, and if the horizontal movement of the air is small, the\r\nloftiest point of the cloud will be situated approximately above\r\nthe centre of its base. But if the horizontal movement increases in\r\nvelocity, so that the top is in a more rapidly moving stratum than the\r\nbase, it will lean forward in the direction of movement. This is a very\r\ncommon phenomenon, being generally shown by cumulus on a windy day.\r\n\r\nOn much rarer occasions the converse occurs, and the top of the cloud\r\nlags behind the base, the explanation being a lessening of the velocity\r\nof the wind as the height above ground increases. But such conditions\r\nrarely occur, and when they do they are due to local eddies and affect\r\nonly a limited area. Hence such clouds are isolated, and indicate a\r\ndisturbed state of the air and uncertainty of weather. The clouds which\r\nlean forward are formed under conditions which are spread over wide\r\ndistricts, such as the rear of a large cyclone, and cumulus of that\r\nkind may follow one another across the sky for hours or even days as\r\nlong as the wind persists.\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered only the round-topped types of cumulus--those\r\nwhich mark the tops of ascending currents whose ascent has been\r\nstopped at a comparatively early stage, or those whose ascent is still\r\nin that early stage, though the upward movement has not yet come to an\r\nend. The full story of the growth of a cumulus is identical with that\r\nof the youth of a cumulo-nimbus, the later stages of which we will\r\nconsider in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCUMULO-NIMBUS\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANDEST of all clouds are the huge mountains of vapour which are the\r\nparents of summer thunder-storms. They are at once distinguished from\r\nordinary cumulus by their upper parts, which sometimes reach beyond the\r\nregion of the alto clouds high into the realm of cirrus, and extend\r\noutwards as a broad disc, which is occasionally indistinguishable from\r\nthe cirro-nebula and cirro-stratus which form the van of a cyclone\r\ncloud canopy. Indeed, there seems to be no essential dividing line\r\nbetween a large cumulo-nimbus and the cloud pile of a small cyclone,\r\nand no real difference between them except their size.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the term cumulo-nimbus would only be given to the\r\ncloud when a large fraction of the whole can be seen at once.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with common cumulus, it has been pointed out that the\r\ncessation of the uprising convection currents which determines the\r\nmaximum height to which the cloud will grow is due to the rate of\r\ncooling within the ascending column being greater than the rate of\r\ncooling outside it. It follows that when the ascending current has\r\nreached a certain height it will, as a whole, be just as heavy as an\r\nequal column outside. Ascent must then cease. The equilibrium of the\r\nair in such a case is said to be stable, and the condition of such\r\nstability is simply that the general rate of fall of temperature per\r\n100 metres of ascent is less than the rate of cooling dynamically\r\nproduced in an ascending current.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the general rate of fall of temperature is greater than\r\nthat produced dynamically, the consequence will be that the upward\r\ntendency of the rising air will increase as it moves upward, and the\r\ntaller the column becomes the greater will be the difference of weight\r\nbetween the inside and outside columns. In such a case the equilibrium\r\nis said to be unstable, and the result will be the production of\r\ncumulo-nimbus.\r\n\r\nJust as cumulus may be divided into heat cumulus and the clouds of\r\nthe rear of a cyclone, so cumulo-nimbus may be divided into the same\r\ntwo groups. In the case of the heat thunder-clouds the instability\r\nof the air is effected by the rapid heating of its lower layers in\r\ncontact with the ground, those lower layers being so quickly warmed\r\nthat there is not time for them to become mixed with the overlying\r\nair in which the rate of decrease is normal. If there is much wind we\r\nrarely get cumulo-nimbus, because the heated air is mixed mechanically\r\nwith the overlying parts, and the rate of decrease is approximately\r\nnormal throughout. Calm air and hot sun are then one set of necessary\r\nconditions for the production of instability.\r\n\r\nBut it is well known that thunder-showers and lesser examples of\r\ncumulo-nimbus are by no means infrequent in the rear of a cyclone, and\r\nsuch storm clouds are usually attended by considerable wind. They are,\r\nas a rule, much smaller than those produced by heat, but they have the\r\nsame form, and are evidently due to instability in the lower part of\r\nthe air, and the question is how can that condition be produced. In\r\norder to find the answer it is necessary to refer to the temperature\r\nphenomena of a cyclonic area. If a cyclone be divided into four\r\nquadrants by two lines drawn through its centre, one in the direction\r\nin which the system is travelling and the other at right angles to\r\nit, then the front right-hand quadrant is the warmest and the rear\r\nright-hand quadrant much colder. The cumulo-nimbus clouds of a cyclone\r\nare limited to the first part of this cold quadrant, that is to say, to\r\nthe portion of the storm in which a great volume of cold air is flowing\r\nover a district which has just been warmed and wetted by the preceding\r\npart. The result is that, the air being warmed by contact with damp\r\nground at a temperature many degrees above that of the air itself, we\r\nhave produced exactly the same unstable state at a low temperature as\r\nwe have at a high temperature in the case of heat storms. The lower\r\ntemperature of the whole is enough to account for the smaller volume\r\nof the cloud, and that in turn explains why cyclone thunderstorms are,\r\ngenerally speaking, on a much smaller scale than heat storms.\r\n\r\nThe life history of a cumulo-nimbus is easily studied on a suitable\r\nday. The rapid heating of the lower layers of air causes them\r\nto expand bodily, and as they do so they lift the overlying air,\r\nfrequently in broad domes or waves. The first result is the expansion\r\nof these upper zones, which are lightened by the flowing away of\r\nstill higher layers. Expansion means chilling, and sooner or later\r\nits effects become visible in the formation of cirro-stratus,\r\ncirro-cumulus, or alto-cumulus. Simultaneously the heated air near the\r\nground begins to rise up in tall columns, while the cooler air from a\r\nlittle higher descends to take its place. Soon patches of lower cloud\r\nappear, at first hazy and indistinct, but gradually shaping themselves\r\ninto cumulus with hazy base and rounded summits. These rapidly assume\r\nthe typical pyramidal shape, with level base and sharply contoured\r\ntop, and so far there is little to distinguish them from an ordinary\r\ncumulus (see Plate 48). But watch them carefully. Here and there some\r\nwill be growing taller than their fellows, and as they grow their rate\r\nof growth increases until the top begins to show signs of spreading\r\noutwards. Rapidly the bulging summit throws out long fingers of\r\ncloud, radiating from the central column almost as if propelled by\r\nsome repulsive force. At first, these fingers are merely projecting\r\nlumps of cloud with rounded ends, but in a few minutes they undergo a\r\nsudden and striking change. The whole summit becomes frayed out, drawn\r\nout into long radiating lines, which thin off against the blue sky\r\nexactly like the edges of a sheet of cirro-stratus. False cirrus is\r\nthe name commonly given to this, but there seems no valid reason why\r\nit should be regarded as “false.” The top of the cloud rapidly spreads\r\nhorizontally, forming a disc of cirriform cloud, which sometimes\r\nspreads several miles ahead of the rest of the storm. Meanwhile, the\r\noriginal cumulus column loses all its deep folds and convolutions, and\r\nother round-topped cumulus arise around it until the completed system\r\nconsists of a more or less disc-shaped mass of cumulus, with a common\r\nbase, rising higher and higher towards some central point, where these\r\nare connected, by an uprushing column of vapour, to an upper disc with\r\ncirriform margins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 48.\r\n\r\nTHUNDER-CLOUDS FORMING.]\r\n\r\nIn Plate 49 we have on the left hand a specimen in which the\r\noutspreading is just beginning, and the same cloud is shown half an\r\nhour later on the left of plate 50. A complete cumulo-nimbus in full\r\nwork is shown on the right of Plate 49, and the same appears on the\r\nright in Plate 50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 49.\r\n\r\nTHUNDER-CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulo-nimbus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 50.\r\n\r\nTHUNDER-CLOUDS.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulo-nimbus._)]\r\n\r\nThese clouds were thunder-clouds, the larger one being a smart\r\nthunderstorm with heavy hail. They were photographed in the evening,\r\nand in the second picture the sun was just below the horizon.\r\n\r\nBut, to continue the story of a thunder-cloud, we always find that\r\nafter a time the cirriform top flattens out and gradually subsides,\r\nand this is usually accompanied by a descent of the cloud base to a\r\nlower level. Meanwhile, it frequently happens that the whole series of\r\nphenomena is repeated in one of the attendant cumulus. Plates 51 and 52\r\nare also two views of the same cloud at different times. In Plate 51 we\r\nhave the main part of the storm on the right, while on the extreme left\r\na lower part of the cloud is rising rapidly into a tall dome. In Plate\r\n52 the central top has lost its cirriform margin and has distinctly\r\nflattened, while the left-hand dome has risen much higher and is\r\nbeginning to throw out the projecting bits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 51.\r\n\r\nTHUNDER-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulo-nimbus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 52.\r\n\r\nTHUNDER-CLOUD.\r\n\r\n(_Cumulo-nimbus._)]\r\n\r\nThe hard-topped cumulus which fringe the lower disc, and the vast pile\r\nof cirriform and hazy cloud which forms the centre of a cumulo-nimbus,\r\nare shown in Plate 53, which represents part of the side of a great\r\nthunder-cloud. In this case the diameter of the lower disc was about\r\n15 miles, and the upper disc was rather larger. The uprising column\r\nin the middle was about 7 miles across, and the height from base to\r\nsummit about 3 miles. The whole system contained between 100 and 150\r\ncubic miles of cloud. When photographed it was over the northern part\r\nof Salisbury Plain. Lightning played repeatedly between the back of the\r\nwhite cumulus and the hazy mass behind it, and the rumble of thunder\r\nwas all but continuous for nearly half an hour as the great cloud\r\npassed by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 53.\r\n\r\nTHE FLANK OF A GREAT STORM.]\r\n\r\nThis was an unusually large cloud for this country, but specimens of\r\n10, 20, or 30 cubic miles are quite common.\r\n\r\nNow for the explanation of the series of events. To begin with, we have\r\nthe production of an ordinary cumulus, but the equilibrium is unstable,\r\nthe growth of the cloud, therefore, becomes more and more rapid, and\r\nthe rapid condensation adds to the instability until the rising\r\ncolumn is so much lighter than an equal column outside that a powerful\r\nupdraught is created, strong enough for a time to hold up the raindrops\r\nor even hailstones. At length the condensation is complete, the upper\r\npart of the cloud consisting of snow crystals exactly like those of any\r\nother cirrus. In the mean time, the rapid ascending current necessarily\r\ninvolves an indraught from around, and consequent descending currents\r\nto supply it. The result is to set up a circulating system, moving\r\ninwards along the ground, upwards in the central column, and outwards\r\nin the upper disc. The downward currents are sometimes shown by a\r\ncurling over of the edges of the upper disc, but the phenomenon is not\r\noften seen, as the descending movement is generally enough to dry up\r\nthe cloud particles.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rising of damp air drawn from the ground brings about rapid\r\ncondensation and heavy rain. The large size of thunder-drops is almost\r\ncertainly due to the fact that it is only the larger drops which can\r\nfall in the teeth of the strong updraught. But when these drops begin\r\nto fall, and still more when cold hailstones begin to fall through\r\nthis ascending air, it becomes chilled from top to bottom, and the\r\ncolumn is broken or even stopped altogether. The frozen particles\r\nwhich make up the top subside gradually, and the chilling of the air\r\nimmediately below the cloud brings the saturation level nearer the\r\nground, and we say the cloud base descends.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of a thunder-cloud into the upper and lower discs with\r\na connecting uprush gives to the typical cloud a shape something like\r\nthat of an anvil when seen sideways, but in the larger clouds the\r\ndisc-like form is more obvious. In any ordinary thunderstorm the great\r\nmajority of the discharges of lightning play between the two discs, and\r\nthe larger the cloud the more frequent these are. Such discharges as\r\npass between the cloud and the earth come exclusively from the base of\r\nthe lower disc if the cloud is large, and generally follow immediately\r\nafter or simultaneously with one between the two discs. The phenomena\r\nof lightning are intensely interesting, but the purpose of these pages\r\nis confined to the study of clouds and cloud forms, and it would be\r\ngoing beyond our scope to discuss either lightning or hail. Both are,\r\nhowever, so closely related to cumulo-nimbus that they can hardly be\r\npassed over in silence. One thing is certain, and that is that neither\r\nthe electrical developments nor the hail has anything to do with the\r\ngrowth of the cloud. On the contrary, both are consequences of the\r\ncloud, the hail being due to the great altitude, and consequent low\r\ntemperature of the upper part of the cloud, and also to the violent\r\nuprising currents within it; while the electrical phenomena are due\r\nto either the enormous amount of condensation, or to friction due\r\nto the rapid uprush, or more probably to the fact that considerable\r\ndifferences of electrical condition exist in the distant parts of the\r\nair connected by the cloud, and between which its circulating currents\r\nmove. These differences are known to exist at all times, and we cannot\r\nhere discuss their origin.\r\n\r\nThe formation of cumulo-nimbus and cumulus is dependent upon the\r\npresence of a large amount of water vapour. It is worth while to\r\nconsider whether the atmospheric movements which bring about the\r\ncondensation could exist without moisture. Wherever we find differences\r\nof temperature between neighbouring places we must get currents of\r\nhot air rising from the warmer spots, and compensating descending\r\ncurrents around them. But we have pointed out that if the rate of\r\ncooling as we ascend in the still air is less than the rate at which\r\nan ascending current will be dynamically cooled, such a rising current\r\nwill come to rest. If, on the other hand, the rate of cooling in the\r\nascending current be less than in the still air, the equilibrium will\r\nbe unstable, and a violent uprush will result.\r\n\r\nNow, in a climate such as our own, where the lower regions of the air\r\ncontain large quantities of water vapour, any considerable rise brings\r\nabout more or less condensation, and that condensation is attended by\r\na liberation of very large quantities of heat, which retard cooling in\r\nthe ascending current, and so facilitate the production of instability.\r\nBut if this cause is put aside it is still possible to have a similar\r\ncirculation. When discussing the causes of instability, it has been\r\npointed out that the prime condition was an unusually rapid rate of\r\nfall of temperature in still air, such as may be produced by hot\r\nsunshine. Now, these conditions are exactly those which will give\r\nrise to the phenomenon of the mirage, and which reach their fullest\r\ndevelopment in great desert districts when the air is still.\r\n\r\nAgain, it has been pointed out that the causes which bring showers and\r\nthunderstorms to an end include the chilling of the lower parts of the\r\nascending column by the descent of cold rain or hail from above. We may\r\nalso add the shading of the underlying ground by the cloud itself, and\r\nthe absorption of heat in the partial evaporation of some of the rain\r\nduring the lower part of its fall. In a desert district the arising\r\ncurrents are so dry that even a very great ascent does not often result\r\nin visible cloud; and when it does, the cloud is produced at so great\r\na height that the air is too rarefied to produce anything much denser\r\nthan thin alto-stratus, from which no falling droplets could reach\r\nthe earth. It seems, then, that there will be no such automatic check\r\non the growth of the circulating system, and it will go on growing in\r\nvolume and intensity indefinitely. As a matter of fact, this is not the\r\ncase. A different check does come into operation, but not until the\r\nindraught and updraught have become so powerful as to draw up the dust\r\nand sand and generate a sandstorm, the weight and shade of which, in\r\ntime, destroys the circulating currents which uplifted them.\r\n\r\nSince, however, condensation is a considerable factor in producing\r\ninstability, we should expect that such sandstorms would be rarer than\r\nthunderstorms are in an equally hot but well-watered district, which\r\nis the fact. Again, since rain and cloud are checks upon such systems,\r\nwe should expect the sandstorm systems to be larger and far loftier\r\nthan thunderstorms, and to consist of far more violent atmospheric\r\nmovements. This also is the case, and when we know that some of these\r\ndisturbances have the dimensions of a cyclonic storm, it is easy to\r\nunderstand how the finest dust may be raised to vast altitudes, into\r\nthe great upper currents of the air, by which it may be borne hundreds\r\nof miles before returning to the ground. It is thus that the dust of\r\nthe African deserts is carried across the Mediterranean to Europe, and\r\nthe yellow loess from Mongolia even to the eastward of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWAVE CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE has already been made on more than one occasion to the\r\nremarkable rippled or wavy structure sometimes assumed by clouds. The\r\nwaves may be of almost any dimensions, from the broad bands into which\r\na sheet of cirro-stratus or of alto-stratus is sometimes divided, down\r\nto the most minute ripples. Sometimes they are ranged in long straight\r\nlines, sometimes they are bent into sharp angles, and sometimes curved\r\nin very elaborate patterns; but whether they be large or small,\r\nstraight or curved, no one can see them and fail to conclude that they\r\nmust be due to an action more or less analogous to the causes which\r\nproduce waves on the sea or ripple marks upon the sand.\r\n\r\nWave clouds occur at all heights where clouds are formed. The break-up\r\nof a lifting fog into roller clouds is probably the lowest example,\r\nbut it may more frequently be seen in higher clouds of the alto or\r\ncirrus kinds.\r\n\r\nA low example is given in Plate 40, which represents stratus maculosus,\r\nand which has already been described. A higher type is shown in Plate\r\n54, which is a wave-like arrangement of alto-cumulus. Rather higher\r\ncome the long zig-zag bands of Plate 55, in which the stratiform\r\narrangement is more obvious, and which would be best described as a\r\nwave-form of alto-stratus. These two plates form striking contrasts.\r\nThe clouds shown in the first are distinctly of the cumulus order, and\r\na prominent feature is the way in which the right-hand side of each\r\nwave has a clear-cut rounded contour like that of the upper edge of\r\na small cumulus, while the left-hand edge of each band is frayed out\r\ninto a ragged fringe. The whole cloud was moving slowly in a direction\r\nnearly, but not quite, at right angles to the waves, and the fringed\r\nedge formed the rear. It is evident that this peculiar structure must\r\nbe due to a series of narrow waves intersecting a plane in which the\r\nair is just on the point of producing alto-cumulus. If there were no\r\nsuch waves, the little uprising currents, with their intervening\r\ndown currents, would be irregularly distributed, and all the wave\r\ndisturbances have had to do is to arrange them. The consequence is\r\nthat as the waves pass along the stratum the air is alternately raised\r\nand lowered. Where it is rising condensation takes place, where it is\r\nfalling evaporation results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 54.\r\n\r\nCRESTED ALTO WAVES.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-cumulus Undatus._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 55.\r\n\r\nALTO WAVES.\r\n\r\n(_Alto-stratus Undatus._)]\r\n\r\nThe cloud, like most other wave clouds, did not retain its features for\r\nany length of time, but the gaps closed slowly in as the cloud-bands\r\nincreased in size, until a sheet of alto-stratus was produced. Since\r\nthe time of day was the morning, it is almost certain that the plane\r\nof saturation was rising in accordance with the general law, which is\r\nthat the planes of condensation rise steadily, until about two or three\r\no’clock in the afternoon, and then slowly descend.\r\n\r\nIn Plate 55 each band is much flatter and less dense. They are just\r\nas evidently formed by wave movements intersecting the plane of\r\ncondensation; but this was formed in the evening when the sun was\r\nnearing the horizon, and at a time when the cloud planes are as a rule\r\nrapidly descending.\r\n\r\nAmong the alto clouds wave-forms sometimes persist for a fairly long\r\ntime, and in this case the bands moved steadily onward in a direction\r\nequally inclined to their length and breadth, that is to say, from the\r\nbottom left-hand corner of the photograph to the top right-hand corner.\r\nAs they passed across the sky new bands kept on making their appearance\r\nat about the same spot, each band persisting with little change until\r\nit had passed out of sight.\r\n\r\nGoing much higher up into the region of cirrus, we meet with the\r\nmost minute and delicate ripple clouds. Some of these have already\r\nbeen referred to. They are connected with either cirro-macula,\r\ncirro-cumulus, or cirro-stratus, just as the coarser textured waves we\r\nhave been considering are connected with alto-cumulus or alto-stratus.\r\nIn Plate 56 we have an example in which we can see the stages in\r\nthe process. Nearest to the zenith we have cirro-cumulus, which is\r\nhere and there irregularly distributed, but is generally arranged in\r\ndelicate ripples, which are variously curved. Nearer the horizon the\r\ntroughs of the waves are filled in, and sheets of cirro-stratus are the\r\nresult. Here, again, the wave-form is evidently not typical. It is an\r\narrangement of either cirro-cumulus or cirro-stratus, produced by the\r\nintersection of the plane of condensation by a series of wave movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 56.\r\n\r\nCIRRO RIPPLES.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-cumulus Undatus._)]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is, however, so striking a feature when it is well\r\nshown that any description of the cloud which contains no reference to\r\nthe waves is manifestly incomplete, and this would be best effected\r\nby adding the word undatus or waved to the name of the cloud. Plate\r\n54 will then be alto-cumulus undatus, Plate 55 alto-stratus undatus,\r\nand Plate 56 would be described as cirro-cumulus undatus, passing into\r\ncirro-stratus undatus and cirro-stratus. In popular language Plate 55\r\nmight be called alto waves, Plate 54 crested alto waves, and Plate 56\r\ncirro ripples.\r\n\r\nIf we are satisfied that the wave clouds are due to a wave movement\r\nintersecting a plane of incipient cloud formation, the whole question\r\nof their mode of production resolves itself into two parts--how is that\r\nplane of incipient condensation produced? and how can we account for\r\nthe intersecting waves?\r\n\r\nThe first question has by far the greater importance, since it amounts\r\nto asking for a general explanation of the production of high clouds,\r\nespecially the forms of cirro-cumulus, cirro-stratus, cirro-macula,\r\nand the corresponding alto varieties. There are, again, two divisions\r\nalso to this question. How does the water vapour reach the stratum\r\nin sufficient quantity to saturate it? and when condensation takes\r\nplace, why does it so frequently assume the characteristic mottled\r\nand granular forms like crowds of little cumulus clouds arranged in\r\none level? This last sentence gives the clue. They are, in truth,\r\nlittle cumulus clouds, and must be formed in exactly the same way as\r\ntheir vastly larger prototypes of lower regions. It has been explained\r\nthat low cumulus is the result of large upward moving air columns or\r\nconvection currents, each one being initially caused by the heating of\r\nthe vapour-laden air near the ground, and each uprising column being\r\nsupplied by cooler descending air which flows down in the intervening\r\nspaces. It has also been explained that these movements result in\r\nchanges of temperature, which tend to check those movements and restore\r\nthe original equilibrium. Suppose this to occur, as it constantly does,\r\nwithout any column reaching sufficiently high to produce a cloud. There\r\nwill be no visible effect, but, nevertheless, an important change has\r\ntaken place. Every ascending current has lifted some water vapour with\r\nit to a higher level, and the descending drier air has come down in\r\ncontact with the ground or damper air to become equally charged with\r\nmoisture in its turn. The process will be repeated again and again,\r\nand at one level after another, so that the water vapour travels ever\r\nhigher and higher.\r\n\r\nThis process of interchange between ascending and descending air\r\nhas been called by Mr. Ley inversion, but the term does not seem\r\nvery suitable, and interconvection would be better. The two opposite\r\ncurrents pass through each other, as if the ascending air gathered\r\nitself into definite channels, and passed through holes in the\r\ndescending mass like the passage of water upwards through a descending\r\nplate of perforated metal. Moreover, just as the holes in such a\r\ndescending plate might have any size, so that the ascending streams\r\nmight vary in breadth from the finest hair to a column of huge\r\ndiameter, in exactly the same way the ascending columns of air may vary\r\nfrom the smallest imaginable size to the great cumulo-nimbus currents.\r\nIt is the little currents which account for the constant quiver of the\r\nmargins of any object which is viewed through a large telescope by day,\r\nand for the haze, so characteristic of a hot day, which makes distant\r\nobjects seem ill-defined and in a state of continual tremble. The rays\r\nof light in passing through the intersecting streams are bent a little,\r\nnow this way, now that, as the air currents sway to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe near neighbourhood of the ground is not essential. As long as the\r\ntemperature of the air at any level is rising, so long interconvection\r\nmust occur. The process will be independent of the presence or absence\r\nof wind. All that wind can do is to mix up the air at different levels,\r\nbreaking the system of currents and reducing it to, so to say, a finer\r\ntexture, or producing eddies, if strong enough, which direct the\r\ncurrents and gather them into definite channels. The final result in\r\nany case is that, with rising temperature, water vapour is steadily\r\nborne upwards from the ground.\r\n\r\nAs it ascends the air becomes cooler, and yet retains its water vapour.\r\nWhen the rising currents are large they mix little with the descending\r\ndry air, and on reaching a certain level condensation takes place,\r\nand we have the beginning of a cumulus. If they are of a more moderate\r\nsize they will ascend less rapidly, the admixture with descending air\r\nwill bear a larger proportion to the whole, and the plane at which\r\ncondensation will begin will be higher, and then each small column\r\nwill be tipped with a ball of alto-cumulus. Make the interconvection\r\ncurrents smaller still, and the cloud plane will be lifted yet higher,\r\nand we shall have cirro-cumulus or cirro-macula.\r\n\r\nNow, the more even the distribution of temperature on the ground the\r\nless the probability of coarse interconvection, and the same is true\r\nof any higher stratum of air, provided it is free from disturbing\r\ninfluences from outside. If, therefore, we have large currents near\r\nthe ground, ending, as they must, in cumulus, it has already been\r\nexplained that these clouds stop the action, and the general system of\r\nlarge currents will be restricted to the region in which they occur. At\r\nsome distance above the lower clouds the only difference will be that\r\nwater vapour has been brought up to their level in great abundance.\r\nSmaller systems of interconvection can then exist, and so we may have\r\nthe spectacle of several layers of cloud--cumulus capping the great\r\ncurrents of lower regions, alto-cumulus forming the summits of the\r\nsmaller currents of intermediate regions, and cirro-cumulus floating\r\nfar above both.\r\n\r\nFrequently it happens that before the ascent of vapour has gone quite\r\nfar enough to produce a cloud, other causes co-operate, and the cloud\r\nmakes its appearance suddenly over considerable patches of sky. The\r\nmost potent of these is a fall of the barometric pressure, which is\r\nbrought about by some of the air far above the region of even the\r\nhighest clouds flowing away to some other district. The air at all\r\nlower levels being thus relieved of the superincumbent pressure,\r\nimmediately expands, and is thereby cooled throughout. Consequently, if\r\nat any level it was near its point of saturation, it will be carried\r\nbeyond that point, and cloud will rapidly make its appearance over a\r\nlarge part of the sky, possibly at more than one level. Stratiform\r\narrangements will be the rule; but if interconvection is going on at\r\nthe time, its presence will be betrayed by a granular or cumuloid\r\nstructure. Interconvection clouds should then be most frequent, and\r\nbest formed when the air as a whole is still or moving slowly (so as\r\nnot to create great eddies), when the temperature is rising rapidly,\r\nand when the barometer is making a sudden fall. All these conditions\r\nare met in thunder weather, and at the time when a summer anticyclone\r\nis giving way. It will be remembered that many of the most beautiful\r\nforms have been described as forming under one or the other of these\r\nvery conditions.\r\n\r\nA second contributing cause, and one which tends to make the\r\ncondensation in patches or long broad bands ranged roughly at right\r\nangles to the direction in which the air is moving, has been referred\r\nto earlier. It is the passage of the air over an undulating country;\r\nthe up-and-down movements of the lower air being transmitted upwards\r\nto great altitudes, as ever broadening and flattening waves. If the\r\nupper air is flowing more rapidly than the lower, these broad waves\r\nmay be far ahead of their real cause, which will, therefore, quite\r\nescape recognition, but the phenomenon is constantly to be detected\r\nin the arrangement of the lower clouds. Two instances in the writer’s\r\nexperience will suffice. It was desired one morning to measure the\r\naltitude of some small clouds which were passing from the north-west\r\nat a height of probably between 2000 and 4000 metres, over a hill only\r\nabout 150 metres higher than the valley in which the apparatus was\r\nfixed. In order to make the measurement, it was necessary for the cloud\r\nto cross the valley and appear in the same field of view as the sun,\r\naccording to the method that will be described further on. But in order\r\nto cross the valley the air had to descend, and so, of course, had the\r\ncloud stratum, though to a less extent. But small as the descent was,\r\nit was enough to dry up the clouds entirely, and for more than a couple\r\nof hours the clouds came sailing over the hill, disappearing entirely,\r\nand then reforming so far beyond that no measurement was possible,\r\nsince not one single fragment came near enough to the position of the\r\nsun, which remained shining brightly through a broad clear gap between\r\ntwo patches of cloud-strewn sky.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion considerable preparations had been made for some\r\nphotographic observations during an eclipse of the sun. The observatory\r\nstands on the eastern side of the valley of the Exe, which is flanked\r\non its western side by a long ridge of hills going up to 800 feet above\r\nthe sea. Beyond these hills lies the deep, narrow valley of the Teign,\r\nand beyond that the granite ramparts of Dartmoor, 1000 feet above the\r\nsea. The wind was blowing gently across the two valleys, and shortly\r\nbefore the eclipse began a broad strip of thin cloud formed above and\r\nrather towards the eastern side of the Exe valley, just where the sun\r\nwas, while at the same time the sky was practically clear half a mile\r\nfurther east, and bright sunlight was streaming down on the ridge\r\nbetween the two rivers a few miles towards the west. The cloud was\r\nnever thick enough to quite hide the sun, so that the eclipse was easy\r\nto watch with the naked eye; but in spite of fairly rapid movement of\r\nthe cloud masses as they drifted before the sun, they kept on forming\r\nin just the same place, and completely prevented the carrying out of\r\nthe programme planned. It is almost certain that the phenomenon was\r\nbrought about by an upward moving wave marking the place where the\r\nlevel of approaching saturation was upheaved by the disturbance caused\r\nby crossing the two valleys and intervening ridge.\r\n\r\nThese two instances are not quoted as examples of a rare occurrence,\r\nbut as definite simple instances of a phenomenon which may be\r\nconstantly observed, and as proof that the conformation of the ground\r\ndoes exercise an influence upon the distribution of cloud.\r\n\r\nBut no irregularities of the ground will suffice to explain the minute\r\nwaves and ripples which have been described at the beginning of this\r\nchapter. These must be due to wave disturbances in the air itself.\r\nThey have been explained as due to two different currents of air,\r\neither a warm damp current flowing over a cold one, or _vice versâ_.\r\nNow, such an occurrence as a warm damp current flowing over a cold\r\none must be very rare, though it is impossible to deny that it might\r\noccur. The immediate contact of a cold current above a warm damp one is\r\nequally unlikely, unless the general atmospheric condition were greatly\r\ndisturbed, which is the same thing as saying that wave clouds would not\r\noccur. They are most frequent at just those times when interconvection\r\nhas freest play, and this is amply sufficient to account for a plane of\r\nsaturation without any necessity for a hypothesis of two layers of air\r\nat different temperatures all but producing cloud at their junction.\r\nNo convincing evidence of cloud production by such means has yet been\r\nadduced, and it is better to rely upon causes which we know do operate\r\nthan to call in theories as to what might possibly happen. This is\r\none of those points in the study of clouds which need investigation,\r\nand until proof is forthcoming it is better to say that the admixture\r\nof two strata of air might conceivably produce cloud, but most forms\r\ncan be accounted for by other causes of which we have more positive\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nStill, the wave clouds are due to waves, and there seems no other way\r\nof accounting for them than the supposition of gentle differential\r\ncurrents. But if such currents occur the ripples and waves will not\r\nbe limited to a definite surface, so to say, of contact, but will be\r\npropagated upwards and downwards for considerable distances from the\r\nlevel of greatest disturbance. Whether, therefore, the level at which\r\nthe natural operation of interconvection has produced saturation is\r\nhigh or low in this region, the result will be the marshalling of the\r\nascending and descending elements of the convection system in the\r\ncharacteristic waves.\r\n\r\nThe differential currents, then, which cause the waves must not be\r\nconceived as producing those waves at a surface of contact, nor must\r\nthe currents be thought of as separated by any definite surface, but\r\nrather by a region of variable but usually considerable depth, in which\r\nthe air is disturbed by a series of small slow eddies and oscillatory\r\nmovements. When the waves are parallel straight lines the air currents\r\nmay be really portions of a whole, having the upper part more rapid\r\nthan the lower. In such a case the direction of movement should be\r\nat right angles to the cloud lines. If the upper current differs in\r\ndirection as well as velocity, the direction of movement of the clouds\r\nwill be intermediate, and will resemble that of the upper or lower\r\ncurrent, according to their relative distances from the plane at which\r\nthe clouds are formed.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the clouds will depend upon the relative shares in\r\ntheir production borne by interconvection pure and simple and by the\r\nwave oscillations. If the stratum is one in which cloud would actually\r\nbe formed independently of the up-and-down movements, all this will\r\nbe able to do will be to arrange the cloudlets at their birth, and\r\nthese will then continue to exist, drifting with the general horizontal\r\nmovement of the air like any other cloud of the same order.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the production of cloud is dependent upon the\r\nvertical oscillations, the cloudlets or lines of cloud will move with\r\nthe air waves, and their rate of motion and direction of motion will\r\nbe determined by the rate and direction of the waves, which may be\r\nquite different from that of the air at that stratum as a whole. The\r\nascending waves will be marked by lines of cloud generally rounder and\r\nbetter defined on their advancing sides, while the descending troughs\r\nwill be marked by clear intervals.\r\n\r\nWave movements of the necessary kind are frequently very complicated,\r\nand it is not by any means a rare occurrence to see the wave lines in\r\none part of the sky at all sorts of angles with similar lines in other\r\nparts, or even to see two or more sets of waves at different altitudes\r\ncrossing one another. Either phenomenon is always accompanied by rapid\r\nchanges in the cloud, and the rippled structure is short-lived. This\r\nwas the case with the clouds shown in Plate 54. Plate 53, on the\r\ncontrary, shows great uniformity in the wave lines, and although the\r\nvertical oscillation is probably the main cause of condensation, the\r\nform was unusually persistent.\r\n\r\nIrregular patches of wave disturbance, affecting a plane occupied by\r\ncirro-stratus vittatus, are shown in Plate 57. In this case the wave\r\nsystems only touch the cloud plane here and there, and the places of\r\ncontact varied rapidly. It is pretty clear from this photograph that\r\nthe idea of the waves being formed at a surface of contact between two\r\ndiverse currents will not suffice. The bands of the cirro-stratus are\r\nfor the most part unbroken and unaffected; it is only here and there\r\nthat the wave region touches them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 57.\r\n\r\nWAVED CIRRO-STRATUS.\r\n\r\n(_Cirro-stratus Undatus._)]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions at which we have arrived are simple, and there is\r\nlittle room for doubt as to their main correctness, but there are\r\nnumerous minute features presented by these beautiful cloud patterns\r\nwhich await interpretation, and they reveal complicated oscillatory\r\nmovements in the air which are difficult to account for, whether we\r\nseek their originating causes or the mechanics of their motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCLOUD ALTITUDES\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING an extended experience of cloud photography, it was found that\r\nit was quite possible to get pictures which showed the cloud detail\r\neven when the sun was in the field of view. Sometimes the solar image\r\nwas reversed, but if the exposure was very short this was not the\r\ncase. In such photographs the structure of the cloud was exceedingly\r\nclear and sharply defined quite close to the sun. Indeed, the intense\r\nillumination seemed to reveal minute details of internal arrangement\r\nwhich could not be detected in similar clouds some distance away.\r\n\r\nThe methods which had been employed for the measurement of cloud\r\naltitudes elsewhere have already been briefly referred to. Some of\r\nthem required two observers, who were equally responsible, each of\r\nthem having to direct his apparatus or camera to the same point of the\r\ncloud, and to record the exact direction in which the instrument was\r\npointed. The instruments, if accurate, were costly, and there were many\r\nopportunities for error in reading the graduated circles which gave the\r\ndirections. Moreover, in most of these methods the two observers were\r\nconnected by telephone, and had to agree on the exact point towards\r\nwhich their instruments should be directed; either the exact point\r\nof the cloud, or the precise direction as shown by the mounting of\r\nthe camera or other instrument. At Kew some of these sources of error\r\nwere avoided by fixing the two cameras with the axes of the lenses\r\nand centres of the plates in a vertical position and exposing the two\r\nplates simultaneously. The Kew observations were not long continued,\r\nand for some years the only measurements in progress were those carried\r\nout abroad, particularly at the Blue Hill Observatory and at Upsala.\r\n\r\nThe experience gained in photographing clouds in order to record their\r\nforms suggested a way in which many of the sources of error in previous\r\nmeasurements of altitude could be avoided, especially by simplifying\r\nand reducing the operations at the moment of making the observation.\r\n\r\nIf two cameras are placed at the opposite ends of a measured base line,\r\nwhose direction is known, and if they are both pointed towards the sun,\r\non making the exposures by electrical means at the same moment, the\r\nposition of the image of the sun upon the plate gives the direction in\r\nwhich the cameras are pointed. It will be in the same direction as seen\r\nfrom both ends of the line.\r\n\r\nNow, if we note the time at which the exposure is made, this with the\r\ndate gives all that is required for ascertaining the sun’s position\r\nin the sky, and is, therefore, the only exact observation which need\r\nbe made at the time of taking the photographs. Mistakes are almost\r\nimpossible, as each plate contains its own record of the sun’s\r\nposition, and even if some of the plates should get mixed the images of\r\nthe clouds will generally suffice to pair them properly. For general\r\nmeasurements there is one grave defect in the method, and that is that\r\nit can only be used when the sun and cloud can be got into the same\r\nfield of view. But with the higher varieties of cloud this is generally\r\npossible, and it was just these higher sorts about which knowledge was\r\nleast certain, and which it was proposed to study.\r\n\r\nAn initial difficulty was the finding of a level site, flat land being\r\nvery uncommon in Devonshire, but fortunately a suitable place was\r\nfound in some artificially levelled ground close to Exeter, belonging\r\nto the London and South Western Railway Company. It was a stretch of\r\nground intended to be covered with sidings, but had not been finished,\r\nand had become overgrown with grass, stunted sallows, and other wild\r\nplants. Being railway ground, it was, comparatively, though by no means\r\nentirely, free from mischievous and inquisitive people. The next point\r\nwas a suitable camera. It must have fairly long focus in order to give\r\na large image, and therefore large displacement; it must be capable\r\nof being pointed in any direction and clamped there; and it must be\r\ncapable of standing considerable extremes of temperature and variations\r\nof dampness, as it was intended that they should be kept on the spot in\r\nwooden structures, which served for stands as well as to contain the\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe pattern finally decided upon is represented in Plate 58, which\r\nshows one of the cameras pointed up to the sky and standing on one of\r\nthe stands. These cameras were to take plates of whole plate size, two\r\ndouble dark slides of the ordinary pattern being attached to each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 58.\r\n\r\nCAMERA FOR MEASURING ALTITUDES.]\r\n\r\nThe camera looks rather complicated, but it is really simple. Its\r\nbody consists of front and back, each attached to a central part by a\r\nshort bellows and sliding on a base board, to which it can be clamped\r\nby screws of the usual pattern. The central part carries trunnions,\r\nsuch as are used for looking-glasses, which swing in sockets carried\r\nby two upright supports, so as to give the whole free motion in a\r\nvertical plane. In order to be able to fix it firmly at any angle, the\r\nbase board of the camera body carries on its underside a thin board\r\nprojecting beneath it and forming a segment of a circle whose centre\r\nwould be the horizontal axis through the trunnions. The board passes\r\nbetween the jaws of a small wooden clamping vice in front, which is\r\ncarried by the square base to which the uprights are fixed. The whole\r\nis firmly made of well-seasoned pine, and has stood well the hard usage\r\nof half a dozen years.\r\n\r\nThere is no focusing screen. Focusing was done with great care once for\r\nall, and then a coat of hard varnish was put over all the adjusting\r\nscrews. A small view-finder is attached to one side, and it was by\r\nthis that the camera was pointed in the desired direction.\r\n\r\nIn order to lessen risk of mistake, it was so arranged that the two\r\nslides belonging to one camera would not fit the other. The lenses,\r\nof 18 inches focus, and giving sharp detail all over the plate, were\r\ncarefully matched, and the focus adjusted until the images given by\r\nthem when placed side by side appeared to coincide exactly. They were\r\nprovided with iris diaphragms, which were shut down to an aperture of\r\na quarter of an inch, and with shutters which could be released at the\r\nsame moment by an electric current, acting through the electro-magnet\r\nshown under the lens on the front of the camera.\r\n\r\nThe shutters were of the kind known as the “Chronolux,” which will give\r\nany exposure from the sixty-fourth of a second up to three seconds. But\r\nit was found in practice that the highest speed was sufficient and gave\r\nsatisfactory results. Of course, there was no idea of adjusting matters\r\non each occasion so as to get the best possible negatives capable of\r\nyielding good prints. Measurement was the object, and if the negative\r\nshowed the sun and sufficient cloud detail for the identification of\r\ncloud points, that was all that was wanted. The shutters gave a good\r\ndeal of trouble at first. Their sliding parts were made of ebonite, and\r\nwhen the cameras were left in their stands with an August sun shining\r\ndown upon them, everything inside got very hot and the ebonite warped;\r\nbut the difficulty was got over by substituting aluminium.\r\n\r\nThe two camera stands were placed 200 yards apart, and were connected\r\nby a line of telegraph wire carried on short poles. At each end of\r\nthe wire an insulated connecting piece was brought down to the camera\r\nstand, and to the batteries and other apparatus. The current which was\r\nsent through this wire by pressing a contact at one end of the line did\r\nnot directly make the exposures; but two similar relays were brought\r\ninto action, and each of these sent the current from a local battery of\r\nLeclanché cells through the electro-magnet on the camera and made the\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nAfter development the two negatives showed the image of the sun, not\r\nfar from the centre of the field of view, and the cloud whose altitude\r\nwas required. Since this was taken from two different points of view,\r\nthe negatives were not alike, but the distances between the centre\r\nof the sun’s disc and any special point of the cloud were different.\r\nFor instance, if the cloud were east of the sun, with its edge just\r\napparently touching the solar image as photographed from the eastern\r\nstation, then the negative taken from the western end of the base would\r\nshow an interval of clear sky between the two, which would be greater\r\nas the cloud was lower.\r\n\r\nIt often happened that after developing the plates the image of the\r\nsun was lost in a black blur, but it was easy to reduce this part of\r\nthe image by local application of a reducing agent[3] by means of\r\na paint-brush, until the disc became clear enough. Two lines were\r\nthen drawn on the negative, one vertical and the other horizontal,\r\nintersecting each other at the centre of the sun’s image. These lines\r\nserved as the starting-points for exactly measuring the distance from\r\ntheir point of intersection to any selected point of the cloud.\r\n\r\nThe distances could generally be determined to a fiftieth or a\r\nhundredth part of an inch, and their difference was, of course,\r\ndependent upon the direction of the sun relative to the base line and\r\nthe altitude of the cloud, but for low level clouds the difference\r\nwas sometimes so great that no pair of corresponding points could be\r\ndetected, while it was often as much as an inch. With higher clouds\r\nthe differences were smaller, but unless the sun was very low in the\r\nsky, either east or west, the displacements of the cloud image were\r\ngreat enough to give reliable measures. Specimen prints from pairs of\r\nnegatives are shown in Plates 59 and 60.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 59.\r\n\r\nPRINT FROM A NEGATIVE USED FOR MEASURING ALTITUDE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 60.\r\n\r\nPAIR OF PRINTS SHOWING THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE CLOUD.]\r\n\r\nThe processes by which the measurements are worked out are\r\nlaborious,[4] and consist of two parts, the first being the\r\ndetermination of the exact position of the sun from the date, hour, and\r\nlatitude and longitude of the place, and the second, the determination\r\nof the position of the cloud. Two points which represent the same part\r\nof the cloud are selected, and their respective distances from the two\r\nlines drawn through the sun are measured as accurately as possible.\r\nNow, a certain distance on the negative corresponds with a definite\r\nangular displacement, and a scale can be constructed showing how much\r\nshould be added to or subtracted from the sun’s position to get the\r\nexact position of the cloud. This being done, it is then a simple piece\r\nof trigonometry to deduce the actual height of the cloud above the\r\nplace of observation. The work of computation, however, was greatly\r\nlightened by the fact that many of the pairs of negatives showed more\r\nthan one layer of cloud; thus Plate 59, which is a fair specimen,\r\nshows three layers, and, consequently, one determination of the sun’s\r\nposition sufficed for three distinct results.\r\n\r\nFor the highest clouds the displacements were, of course, small, and\r\ncould only be made with certainty of a correct result within about\r\nthree hours of noon. Earlier than 9 a.m., or later than 3 p.m., the\r\nsun was too nearly in a line with the two stations, or too low in the\r\nsky, to give a sufficient displacement of image. A base line of 400\r\nyards instead of 200 would have been better for the high clouds. But,\r\non the other hand, when low level clouds are viewed from two different\r\nspots their outlines may seem so changed that it may be impossible to\r\nidentify a pair of corresponding points, and the same difficulty may\r\nalso arise when high clouds are seen through a gap in a lower stratum.\r\nThe longer the base line the more frequent and more obtrusive would\r\nthis perspective difficulty become, so the distance of 200 yards\r\nbetween the stations was adopted as a convenient mean.\r\n\r\nThe method of making the observations was simple. Each observer was\r\nprovided with some signal flags, by which the necessary communications\r\nwere made in accordance with a simple code. Call the two observers A\r\nand B, and suppose A directed the operations. He watched the sky until\r\na favourable opportunity seemed to be approaching. He then signalled\r\nto B, and both cameras were turned to the sun, the dark slides were\r\ninserted, the shutters set, and everything made ready. Signals were\r\nthen interchanged, to signify that preparations were complete, and when\r\nA saw that the edge of the cloud had reached a suitable position to be\r\nin the same field of view with the sun, the contact key was pressed and\r\nthe plates simultaneously exposed. At the moment when this was done the\r\ntime was noted. Several observations were thus made in a short time.\r\n\r\nMeasurements were carried out as opportunity allowed over four\r\nconsecutive seasons, from the beginning of April until the end of\r\nOctober. During the last of the four years, the site had become less\r\nconvenient owing to an extension of the railway work, and early in\r\nNovember the series was brought to an abrupt conclusion by a heavy\r\ngale, which snapped off all the poles carrying the connecting wire. But\r\nby that time 423 measurements had been obtained, the great majority of\r\nwhich referred to clouds of the cirrus and alto groups.\r\n\r\nThe general results may be tabulated thus, giving heights in metres:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------+-------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                     |  Number of  | Maximum | Minimum |  Mean\r\n                     |observations.|altitude.|altitude.|altitude.\r\n                     +-------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Cirrus             |       58    |  27,413 |   4,114 |  10,230\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n  Cirro-stratus      |       64    |  15,503 |   3,840 |   9,540\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n    „   cumulus      |       63    |  11,679 |   3,657 |   8,624\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n  Alto-cumulus       |       83    |   9,390 |   1,828 |   5,348\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n  Cumulus top        |       42    |   4,582 |     --  |   3,006\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n    „     base       |       48    |   1,959 |     584 |   1,290\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n  Strato-cumulus     |       27    |   6,926 |     823 |   2,248\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n  Cumulo-nimbus top  |       15    |   6,409 |   2,004 |   8,002\r\n                     |             |         |         |\r\n    „      „    base |       15    |   2,286 |     766 |   1,045\r\n  -------------------+-------------+---------+---------+---------\r\n\r\nThese values are not very different, on the whole, from those which\r\nhave been arrived at elsewhere, and in making a comparison it must\r\nbe borne in mind that there is always a little want of precision in\r\ncloud nomenclature. As a whole, the Exeter maxima are greater than the\r\nforeign ones, and this is very markedly so in the case of cirrus, for\r\nwhich the American highest record is 14,930 metres, the Swedish record\r\nis 13,376, while the Exeter value is 27,413 metres, or about 17 miles.\r\nBut this extreme measurement, and several others unusually large,\r\nwere made in one morning, a day of very hot damp weather, when cloud\r\nformed at seven different levels: cumulus at a height of 1·9 miles,\r\nalto-cumulus at 3·9 miles, cirro-cumulus at 4·7 miles, cirro-stratus\r\n(No. 1) at 8 miles, cirro-stratus (No. 2) at 9·6 miles, cirrus at 11·5\r\nmiles, and cirrus excelsus at 17 miles. By about half-past one in the\r\nafternoon the sky was completely overcast with dull grey clouds, which\r\ncleared off at half-past four, and at half-past five in the evening the\r\ncirrus had fallen to 7·9 miles, and the cirro-cumulus to 4·3 miles.\r\nIf this one day’s observations had been omitted, the Exeter maximum\r\nwould only have been little more than 1000 metres above the record from\r\nacross the Atlantic, but 1000 metres is a height worth noting.\r\n\r\nWhile the Exeter maxima are all rather greater, we find the minima\r\nfor cirrus, cirro-stratus, and cirro-cumulus are rather less than at\r\nthe foreign stations; that is to say, that clouds are formed over\r\nDevonshire both at lower and at higher levels than seems to be the case\r\nin Massachusetts or Sweden. It seems probable that this is due to a\r\ngreater humidity on our western coasts, such as we should suppose would\r\nbe the case from their position and the prevailing winds and ocean\r\ncurrents. If so, we should expect the great convection clouds to be\r\nlarger. Thus, at Exeter, out of only fifteen examples of cumulo-nimbus,\r\nthe top varied from 2004 metres to 6409, with an average base level\r\nof 1045. At Upsala the maximum was 5970 and the minimum 1400, with an\r\naverage base level of 1400. The mean thickness of the Swedish clouds\r\nwas only 1400 metres, while that of the Devonshire specimens was more\r\nthan 2000 metres.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, during the progress of these measurements, it was\r\nfound that the greatest altitudes and the richest development of the\r\nhigher varieties occurred towards the end of a spell of fine calm\r\nweather, when convection had had free play day after day. A slight\r\nfall of the barometer, only the hundredth part of an inch, would\r\nusually, under those circumstances, bring about abundant formation\r\nof high clouds, frequently of the undatus kind. All the cumulus\r\nclouds, by which we mean to include alto-cumulus and cirro-cumulus,\r\nare most frequent when the levels of condensation are rising, while\r\nthe stratiform clouds are an indication of no vertical movement or\r\nof active descent. Pure cirrus is indicative rather of movement in a\r\nhorizontal direction, and may occur when the condensation levels are\r\nstationary, or when they are rapidly changing either way.\r\n\r\nIn broken weather the natural movements of the atmosphere and of its\r\nvapour are masked and disturbed by the strong eddies brought by the\r\ncyclonic systems. It not unfrequently happens that the region of\r\ndisturbance does not reach up to the level of the highest cirrus, or,\r\nwhat is more probable, the cyclonic system leans so far forward that we\r\nmay have in its rear the upper clouds floating quietly far above the\r\ncomparatively shallow region of disturbance, while in front the upper\r\npart of the storm system projects above undisturbed air.\r\n\r\nThe frequent appearance of cloud almost at the same time at more than\r\none level is at first rather difficult to understand, but it will be\r\nnoticed that when this occurs the barometer almost invariably falls.\r\nNow, if we suppose that the air is nearly saturated at more than one\r\nlevel, and that the whole is then bodily relieved of some of the\r\nsuperincumbent mass, so that the barometer falls, the mass of air will\r\nat once swell up, being cooled from top to bottom simultaneously, and\r\nwherever it is damp enough cloud will be formed.\r\n\r\nThe converse is equally true. If we have cloud at several levels, and\r\nthe whole is compressed by the addition of more air above, which is the\r\ncase when the barometer rises, that compression will be accompanied\r\nby the generation of heat and the consequent disintegration and\r\ndisappearance of the clouds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Ferricyanide of potassium and hyposulphite of soda.\r\n\r\n[4] From the declination of the sun corrected for variation and from\r\nthe known latitude, the meridian zenith distance is calculated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Greenwich time, the longitude, and the equation of time, the\r\nhour angle is obtained.\r\n\r\nNow, if H be the hour angle, D the reduced declination, and M the\r\nmeridian zenith distance, the sun’s altitude may be calculated by the\r\nformula--\r\n\r\n log versin H + L cos lat. + L cos D-20 = log _n_,\r\n\r\nwhere _n_ is a natural number, and\r\n\r\n _n_ + vers M = covers alt.\r\n\r\nAgain, to find the azimuth--\r\n\r\n vers sup. (lat. + alt.)-vers polar dist. = _m_,\r\n\r\nwhere _m_ is another natural number, and\r\n\r\n log _m_ + L sec. lat. + L sec. alt.-20 = log vers azim.,\r\n\r\nreckoned from the south.\r\n\r\nHence the position of the sun is ascertained for both negatives.\r\n\r\nBy actual measurements on the plates and reference to a previously\r\nconstructed scale the position of the cloud as seen from each camera\r\nis next determined, and the angle subtended by the base line at a\r\npoint X vertically beneath the cloud is calculated. If A and B are\r\nthe stations, and _a_ and _b_ the angles from them respectively, the\r\ndistance AX is given thus--\r\n\r\n log AX = L sin _b_-L sin AXB + log AB,\r\n\r\nand the height _h_ of the cloud above X is given by--\r\n\r\n log _h_ = log AX + L tan alt.-10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLOUD NOMENCLATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE a considerable number of new terms have been suggested in the\r\nforegoing pages, it may be convenient to collect them and tabulate\r\nthem, so as to show their relation to those already recognized by the\r\nInternational system.\r\n\r\nIn the atlas put forward by the committee, sixteen varieties are\r\nrecognized by distinct names, and these are drawn up in tabular form\r\nwith appropriate abbreviations for use in making records.\r\n\r\nThe names are--\r\n\r\n  Cirrus.

It follows that if observations are to be made on the\r\noccurrence of these special kinds, with a view to arriving at a\r\nthorough understanding of the circumstances to which they owe their\r\nforms, it becomes necessary to devise a code of names and symbols\r\nwhereby an interchange of ideas and records may be rendered possible.\r\nSpecific names have been proposed as each form was considered, and\r\nit only remains to sum them up concisely. Subsequent observation,\r\nparticularly in other climates, may show that further additions should\r\nbe made; but if the principle of specific names be once admitted, it\r\nwill be easy to fill any omission.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP CIRRUS.\r\n\r\nUnder the general head of cirrus we have found nine distinct forms--\r\n\r\n1. _Cirro-nebula_ (Ley) (Plates 2 and 3). Cirrus veil.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by comparative absence of structure and by the formation\r\nof halo. Ci. Na.\r\n\r\n2. _Cirro-filum_ (Ley) (Plate 7). Thread cirrus.\r\n\r\nBuilt up of fine long threads, straight, curved, or crossing, but free\r\nfrom hazy curling or flocculent structures. Ci. F.\r\n\r\n3. _Cirrus excelsus_ (Plate 5). High cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by great altitude, thinness, irregular branching\r\nstructure. Ci. Ex.\r\n\r\n4. _Cirrus ventosus_ (Plate 6). Windy cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by curving branches leaning forward in the direction of\r\nmovement, and other long curving streamers lagging behind and below.\r\nFluffy parts are usually present, and mark the origins of the long\r\ncurling fibres. Ci. V.\r\n\r\n5. _Cirrus nebulosus_ (Plate 9). Hazy cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the absence of sharply defined lines, fibres, or\r\nstreamers; all parts of the cloud being hazy, and suggestive of other\r\nvarieties of cirrus out of focus. Ci. Neb.\r\n\r\n6. _Cirrus caudatus_ (Plate 8). Tailed cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by small hazy or fluffy heads behind or below which hang\r\nlong streamers, which taper away more or less to a point. The tails are\r\nsharply defined, and so are the edges of the heads. Ci. Ca.\r\n\r\n7. _Cirrus vittatus_ (Plates 12 and 13). Ribbon cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by formation in long bands of cloud, sometimes made of\r\nparallel long fibres with cirrus haze linking them together, sometimes\r\nconsisting of a long bundle of fibres, from which others diverge at an\r\nangle as shown in the plate. Ci. Vt.\r\n\r\n8. _Cirrus inconstans_ (Plate 10). Change cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by a peculiar ragged, wavy appearance. It is\r\ngenerally only the beginning or the end of a mass of cirro-stratus\r\nor cirro-cumulus, but occasionally it vanishes shortly after its\r\nappearance, without reaching the further stage. Ci. In.\r\n\r\n9. _Cirrus communis_ (Plate 11). Type cirrus or common cirrus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by short irregularly curling fibres collected together\r\nin considerable patches. No definite arrangement into any of the forms\r\nalready described. Ci. Com.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP CIRRO-STRATUS.\r\n\r\nUnder this group the cloud usually shows some structure, being\r\napparently built up from a massing together of detached forms at a\r\ncommon level. When this is so it should be described by adding the\r\nspecific name of the detached form most nearly related.\r\n\r\n1. _Cirro-stratus nebulosus_ (Plates 3, 4, and 14). Hazy cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by absence of visible structure. Ci. S. Neb.\r\n\r\n2. _Cirro-stratus communis_ (Plate 16). Common cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the presence of short curling fibres matted together.\r\nCi. S. Com.\r\n\r\n3. _Cirro-stratus vittatus_ (Plate 57). Ribboned cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by being made up of long stripes or bands of cloud. Ci.\r\nS. Vt.\r\n\r\n4. _Cirro-stratus cumulosus_ (Plate 17). Flocculent cirro-stratus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by an obscurely granular structure. Ci. S. Cu.\r\n\r\nMany forms of cirro-stratus are arranged in waves or ripples. This is\r\nindicated by attaching the word undatus, or waved, after the ordinary\r\nspecific name, or the letter U after the abbreviation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP CIRRO-CUMULUS. Divisible into three species.\r\n\r\n1. _Cirro-macula_ (Ley) (Plate 23). Speckle cloud.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by semi-transparency, by the fact that the particles\r\nare frequently whiter and more opaque on their edges. A patch of\r\ncirro-macula always looks like a thin sheet which has curdled. Ci. Ma.\r\n\r\n2. _Cirro-cumulus nebulosus_ (Plates 20 and 21). Hazy cirro-cumulus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized as rounded balls of semi-transparent cloud, but\r\nill-defined and hazy. No shadows. Ci. Cu. Neb.\r\n\r\n3. _Cirro-cumulus_ (Plates 18 and 19).\r\n\r\nCharacterized as opaque rounded balls clearly defined, but showing no\r\nshadows on their under sides. Ci. Cu. Com.\r\n\r\nWave forms again are indicated by the addition of the word undatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP ALTO CLOUDS. Divisible into nine species.\r\n\r\n1. _Alto-stratus._ High stratus.\r\n\r\nA uniform veil of cloud showing no details of structure except local\r\nvariation in density in patches. Rarely dense enough to completely hide\r\nthe sun, or even the full moon. A. S.\r\n\r\n2. _Alto-stratus maculosus_ (Plate 30). Mackerel sky.\r\n\r\nCharacterized as numerous nearly equal and small lenticular patches\r\nranged on a level and about equi-distant from each other. A. S. Mac.\r\n\r\n3. _Alto-stratus fractus_ (Plate 34).\r\n\r\nPatches and bits of cloud of irregular shape, but resembling broken\r\nbits of a level sheet. A. S. Fr.\r\n\r\n4. _Alto-strato-cumulus_ (Plate 32).\r\n\r\nIntermediate between alto-stratus and alto-cumulus. A. S. Cu.\r\n\r\n5. _Alto-cumulus informis_ (Plate 25).\r\n\r\nCharacterized as more or less rounded cloudlets interspersed with\r\nragged bits of cloud and occasionally with streaks of cirrus, the\r\ncloudlets showing no clear-cut outlines, but having distinct shadows.\r\nA. Cu. In.\r\n\r\n6. _Alto-cumulus nebulosus_ (Plate 26).\r\n\r\nHazy alto-cumulus. A. Cu. Neb.\r\n\r\n7. _Alto-cumulus castellatus_ (Plate 28). Turret cloud.\r\n\r\nA high cloud resembling a number of tall narrow cumulus clouds on a\r\nvery diminutive scale. The cloudlets show distinct shadows, are very\r\nopaque, and their upper margins are sharply defined. Vertical axes\r\nlonger than the horizontal ones. A. Cu. Ca.\r\n\r\n8. _Alto-cumulus glomeratus_ (Plate 29).\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the roundness and regularity of the cloudlets, which\r\nhave sharp margins, cast distinct shadows, and have their axes about\r\nequal in all directions. A. Cu. Gl.\r\n\r\n9. _Alto-cumulus communis._\r\n\r\nSmall high cumulus of the ordinary pyramidal pattern. A. Cu. Com.\r\n\r\n10. _Alto-cumulus stratiformis_ (Plate 27).\r\n\r\nFlattened cloudlets gathering into small detached sheets. A. Cu. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nLower clouds. GROUP STRATUS.\r\n\r\n1. _Stratus communis_ (Plates 37 and 41).\r\n\r\nIn its most typical state, stratus consists of a sheet of cloud of\r\napproximately uniform thickness. The most common form, however, does\r\nvary considerably, though usually dense enough to hide the sun.\r\nPortions of such a sheet would take the same specific name, unless the\r\nportions are very small and ragged, which would be expressed by adding\r\nthe word fractus. S. Com.\r\n\r\n2. _Stratus maculosus_ (Plate 40).\r\n\r\nFormed either by the appearance of cloud in lumps, which are always\r\nlenticular in shape, and ultimately join together to form a stratus, or\r\nby the break up of the typical stratus. S. Mac.\r\n\r\n3. _Stratus radius_ (Plate 42). Roll cloud.\r\n\r\nFormed during the break up of a low stratus, which separates up into a\r\nnumber of parallel lines of cloud. S. R.\r\n\r\n4. _Stratus lenticularis_ (Plate 47). Fall cloud.\r\n\r\nFormed by the collapse of cumulus or strato-cumulus. A cloud of\r\nevening, easily recognized as lenticular patches. S. L.\r\n\r\n5. _Strato-cumulus_ (Plates 38 and 39).\r\n\r\nA term applied to either a stratus which has thickened every here and\r\nthere into cumulus, or a number of cumulus which have joined together\r\nso as to show a nearly continuous common base. S. Cu.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP CUMULUS.\r\n\r\n1. _Cumulus minor_ (Plate 43). Small cumulus.\r\n\r\nCumulus clouds so small as to present the appearance of rounded lumps,\r\nno definite pyramidal form or flattened base. Cu. Mi.\r\n\r\n2. _Cumulus major_ (Plates 44 and 45). Large cumulus.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by a flattened base and rounded clear-cut upper surfaces.\r\nCu. Ma.\r\n\r\n3. _Cumulo-nimbus_ (Plates 49 to 52). Storm cloud.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by the expanded, anvil-shaped, or disc-shaped top,\r\ncirrifying at its edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TERMS\r\n\r\n_Nimbus_, a term applied to a cloud from which rain is falling. When\r\nthe form of the cloud is visible, the term should be attached to that\r\nbelonging to the cloud. It may, however, be used as a substantive alone\r\nwhen there is nothing to show from what sort of cloud, or combination\r\nof clouds, the rain is falling (Plates 35 and 36).\r\n\r\nNimbus is either heavy stratus, massive strato-cumulus, or a\r\ncombination of these with stratiform clouds above, and possibly ragged\r\nmasses of fracto-cumulus below. N. either alone or after the sign of\r\nthe cloud.\r\n\r\n_Fracto-_ is a term placed as a prefix before the name of a cloud to\r\nindicate that the cloud has ragged irregular margins, as if it had been\r\nmore or less torn to pieces. It is sometimes less awkward to append the\r\nword fractus after the name of the cloud.\r\n\r\nA convenient abbreviation would be to write F. after the name of the\r\ncloud.\r\n\r\n_Undatus_, or waved, should always be added to the name of any cloud\r\nwhich shows the arrangement so described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCLOUD PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE has been made in the first chapter to the fact that those\r\nwho wish to make a photographic study of clouds must follow a special\r\ncourse of procedure. For every photographic purpose there is some\r\nparticular process or some special kind of apparatus which is better\r\nfitted for the end in view than any other, and half the difficulty in\r\nattaining success is to find out the best tools and the best methods.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty whatever in securing excellent photographs of\r\nheavy grey clouds, or of clouds which stand out dark against a twilight\r\nsky. Any camera and any plate can be used, and in an experienced hand\r\nwill ensure success after a few trials, but except under these special\r\nconditions, cirrus, in all its varieties, the alto clouds, and even\r\nmany of the lower ones, present a real difficulty due to two causes.\r\nIn the first place, they and their surroundings are so brilliant that\r\na very short exposure is sufficient, far shorter than would be needed\r\nfor a sunlit landscape; and in the second place, the actinic value of\r\nthe light they reflect is very little greater than that received from\r\nthe background of blue sky. When so minute a difference comes to be\r\nrepresented in the monochrome of the ordinary photograph, the eye fails\r\nto appreciate it, and all the finer details are lost.\r\n\r\nNow, if proper care is taken in the development of a negative,\r\nsatisfactory results may be attained even if the exposure is twice as\r\ngreat, or only half as great, as it should have been to get the best\r\nresult. But if the exposure is four or more times the best duration,\r\nthe negative will generally yield but poor contrasts, if any result at\r\nall can be coaxed out. Again, if the exposure is only a quarter or less\r\nof the ideal time, little or no image will come out. Suppose, now, we\r\nhave a brilliant object, and the correct exposure for the plate and\r\naperture of lens employed should be one-fiftieth of a second; if we\r\nmake an error either in judging or in effecting the exposure, which\r\namounts to one twenty-fifth of a second too much, we get the negative\r\nexposed three times as much as it should be. Suppose, again, the object\r\nis less brilliant, and the correct exposure should be one-fifth of a\r\nsecond, an equal error of one twenty-fifth will make little difference.\r\nBut in photographing cirrus and such clouds, if we used the same plates\r\nand the same lens apertures as we employ for ordinary landscape work,\r\nwe should want exposures of the order of those given by a focal plane\r\nshutter, and a mistake either in judging or in making the exposure, of\r\neven the hundredth part of a second, would be fatal to good results,\r\nand would probably completely spoil the plate. Evidently one of our\r\nfirst steps must be to lengthen the correct exposure.\r\n\r\nThere are four ways in which this can be done--by using a slow-acting\r\nplate, by lessening the aperture of the lens, by putting some\r\ntransparent screen in front of the lens to shut off some of the light,\r\nand, finally, by pointing the camera, not at the cloud itself, but at\r\nits image in a black mirror.\r\n\r\nOf these, of course the slow plate and small aperture are the simplest\r\nto adopt, and all the cloud studies shown in the illustrations to\r\nthese pages have been taken on plates prepared for photo-mechanical\r\npurposes or for transparencies. There seems to be nothing to choose\r\nbetween these two brands. Orthochromatic, isochromatic, double-coated,\r\nand many other special types of plate had previously been tried, both\r\nwith coloured filters in front of the lens and without them, without\r\nshowing any marked superiority over an ordinary plate of low rapidity.\r\nAt last the photo-mechanical plates were tried, and the efforts made\r\nto get satisfactory cloud portraits, which had previously been marked\r\nonly now and then with satisfactory results, became uniformly and\r\ncontinuously successful.\r\n\r\nIf the slow plates are exposed in the camera without either a screen or\r\nthe black mirror, the diaphragm should be reduced to a small size and\r\nthe exposure suitably adjusted. The length of exposure may generally\r\nbe judged by looking at the image on the focusing screen, and reducing\r\nthe aperture until the picture shows its detail easily. Then, regarding\r\nthe picture as that of a sunlit sea or distant landscape, judge the\r\nnecessary exposure by the brightness of the image.\r\n\r\nNo definite rule can be given. The light varies enormously from day to\r\nday, and hour to hour, and especially with the position occupied by\r\nthe cloud relative to the sun. Thus, working with a lens of six inches\r\nfocus and an aperture of a quarter of an inch, the exposure may vary\r\nfrom the quickest snap of a Thornton-Pickard roller blind to as much as\r\na quarter of a second, or even more. Again, using a lens of eighteen\r\ninches focus and an exposure of a fiftieth of a second, the necessary\r\naperture might vary from an eighth of an inch up to an inch and a\r\nhalf. But if we suppose that we are dealing with an ordinary bright\r\nsummer sky between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and that the clouds are cirrus\r\nor cirro-cumulus, an aperture of about one thirty-second of the focal\r\nlength will probably give some sort of image with a snap-shot exposure.\r\nAt first the failures will be many, but a little practice will soon\r\nenable very respectable pictures to be taken by varying either the\r\ndiaphragm or the speed of shutter. Heavier clouds of the alto types\r\nwill need rather longer exposure or larger aperture.\r\n\r\nThe lens may be of any kind, as long as it gives a well-defined image,\r\nbut there are many advantages in using one of the rectilinear type\r\nprovided with an iris diaphragm. A rapid lens is not needed; indeed, it\r\nhas been pointed out that slowness is a very great desideratum, and if\r\nthe camera is provided with a rapid lens it must be ruthlessly stopped\r\ndown. For general cloud purposes the best kind of lens is a wide-angle\r\nrectilinear, but many occasions will present themselves on which a\r\nlens of longer focus will be wanted in order to give more insight into\r\nthe details of some specially delicate clouds. If the lenses are good,\r\nand the focusing is accurate, enlargements will go a long way towards\r\nrevealing the minuter structures, but the results can never be quite so\r\nwell defined as a direct photograph in a long camera.\r\n\r\nA shutter will be essential, and it should be one which opens in the\r\nmiddle, or which travels across the lens. The shutters which are\r\ningeniously contrived to give more exposure to the lower part of the\r\npicture than to its upper part are useless for the purpose in view. It\r\nshould have some latitude of exposure, from about one-sixtieth of a\r\nsecond up to a full second or more.\r\n\r\nThen as to the camera. Any light-tight camera will do, and, as\r\nthe objects will all be at a great distance, it may very well be a\r\nfixed-focus one, or may be kept set up and fixed in focus for a distant\r\nobject. If not, on setting it up it should be focused on the horizon or\r\nmost distant object possible, and not on the cloud itself. As, however,\r\nthe clouds present themselves at all heights above the horizon, even\r\nin the zenith, it becomes necessary to have some means of pointing the\r\ncamera in such directions. To a certain extent the ordinary stand does\r\nallow of tilting, but a special support which will allow the camera to\r\nbe fixed firmly in any position is of the greatest convenience.\r\n\r\nIf the study is meant to be at all prolonged, the best plan is to make\r\na suitable camera, once for all, which can be left in fixed focus, so\r\nas to be always ready, and which can be directed with equal ease to any\r\npart of the sky, from the horizon to the zenith. If it is intended to\r\nuse a black mirror, then a special mount becomes almost essential.\r\n\r\nMany of the most delicate of the photographs reproduced here have been\r\ntaken with a camera of peculiar pattern, the structure of which is\r\nshown in Plate 61. The lens is an ordinary rapid rectilinear, and the\r\nstop used was generally one-sixteenth of the focal length. The shutter\r\nis a light slip of aluminium, which can be drawn across from side to\r\nside at any desired pace. The body of the camera is mahogany, with a\r\nbellows part for getting correct focus, but when once this was obtained\r\nthe back was clamped to the tail-board and a little varnish brushed\r\nover the clamping screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 61.\r\n\r\nCLOUD CAMERA FOR STUDIES.]\r\n\r\nThe camera swings on a couple of screws, which act as trunnions. These\r\npass through two upright arms, which spring on either side from the\r\nbase board, which is attached to the ordinary camera stand. This base\r\nboard can be rotated into any horizontal position desired, and the\r\ncamera can be tilted through any vertical angle by swinging it between\r\nthe uprights, and can be clamped by tightening the two trunnion screws.\r\nThese screws are so placed on the front of the camera that the lens and\r\nits attachments on the one side nearly balance the back part of the\r\ncamera on the other side, and so lessen the danger of slipping.\r\n\r\nSupported in front of the lens by light brass-work is the black mirror,\r\nmade of a very dark glass optically worked on the front face. It is\r\na curious fact that, although bits of plate-glass blackened on the\r\nback seem to the naked eye to give a single image of sufficient truth,\r\nif such a mirror is placed in front of the camera the second faint\r\nimage formed by reflection from the blackened surface is almost always\r\nto be detected. Moreover, the lens with its large aperture at once\r\ndetects irregularities in the surface of the glass, which are quite\r\nimperceptible through the narrow limits of the pupil. Black glass,\r\nwith a truly worked surface, is essential then, but the surface need\r\nnot be of the high order of excellence required for mirrors used for\r\ntelescopic work, since the first image is not, as a rule, intended to\r\nbe highly magnified.\r\n\r\nThe mirror is held so that its surface makes an angle of about 33\r\ndegrees with the axis of the lens, and the block carrying shutter and\r\nmirror can be turned round into any position by slipping it round the\r\nlens mount as an axis. The mirror thus always retains the correct angle.\r\n\r\nThe action of the mirror is to a large extent due to mere diminution\r\nof brightness, but it also partly extinguishes the blue light of the\r\nsky without exerting any such influence on the white light from a\r\ncloud. This is due to the fact that the blue light of the sky is partly\r\npolarized, while that reflected from the cloud is not. Now, polarized\r\nlight which falls upon a black mirror held in a particular position is\r\nnot reflected by it. This position depends upon various circumstances,\r\nbut one condition is that the reflected ray must make an angle of about\r\n33 degrees with the surface of the glass. The amount of the polarized\r\ncomponent of the blue light varies greatly, but is at a maximum at all\r\npoints 90 degrees away from the sun. This, then, is the best possible\r\nposition for photographing a cloud, as the whole of this polarized\r\ncomponent may be suppressed by adjusting the mirror to the proper\r\nposition, and then the most delicate cirrus fibres stand out brilliant\r\non an almost black background.\r\n\r\nThe black mirror could with some advantage be replaced by a Nicol’s\r\nprism mounted between the components of the lens, so that it could be\r\nturned in any position; but Nicol’s prisms are expensive, and such an\r\narrangement would cost many times the sum sufficient for an excellent\r\nmirror, and then would narrow down the field of view in a very\r\ninconvenient way.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus exposures of a tenth to a fifth of a second were\r\nusually required for high clouds in bright daylight, while longer\r\ntimes, up to a second, might be required under less actively actinic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe exposure having been made, the next step is development.\r\n\r\nNow, every practical photographer has his own pet formula, his own\r\nparticular favourite among the numerous developing compounds now on\r\nthe market. It is, therefore, rather a thankless task to offer advice\r\nas to which should be selected. In all probability as good results may\r\nbe got by other methods and other formulæ, and the description which\r\nfollows must be understood rather as an account of the process actually\r\nadopted, than advice as to that which should be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe developer used has been always pyro and ammonia, made up in\r\naccordance with the formula--\r\n\r\n  Pyro                           30 grains\r\n  Potassium metabisulphite       30   „\r\n  Ammonium bromide               30   „\r\n  Water                          10 ozs.\r\n\r\nBut if much work was anticipated the solution was made up in a more\r\nconcentrated form, and diluted to this strength of 3 grains of pyro per\r\nounce for actual use.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia solution is prepared by mixing 3 drams ammonia fortiss.\r\nwith 20 ozs. of water.\r\n\r\nIn developing it is necessary to remember that our object is to make\r\nthe most of a very small difference in effect. The plate is first\r\nflowed over with a mixture of sufficient developer, with not more than\r\na quarter of its bulk of the ammonia. If the cloud should flash out in\r\na few seconds add more of the pyro solution, but unless the exposure\r\nhas been much overdone this will not happen. If the image begins to\r\nappear after from thirty to forty seconds it is probable that the best\r\nresult will be reached by leaving it alone, but if there is any hanging\r\nback of the detail another quarter bulk of ammonia should be put into\r\nthe glass, the developer mixed with it, and the whole returned to the\r\ndeveloping dish.\r\n\r\nIf no image appears after about forty seconds, add more ammonia as\r\nabove described, and leave for another forty seconds, and so on,\r\nuntil by this method of trial the right quantity of alkali for the\r\nparticular exposure has been ascertained. The development must never be\r\nhurried, or the background of sky will blacken too soon, and in some\r\ncases it may take a quarter of an hour or more to get enough density on\r\nthe cloud. But as a general rule the image is fully out in about two\r\nminutes, and the plate is then washed and fixed in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf a black mirror is used there will seldom be any necessity for\r\nintensification, but if not, it may frequently be required, especially\r\nfor the more delicate kinds of cirrus. Indeed, the image may sometimes\r\nbe so thin that the common process of intensification by mercury and\r\nammonia does not give density enough. If that seems at all likely to\r\nbe the case, it is wiser to use the formula known as Monckhoven’s,\r\nsince that simply adds silver to silver instead of replacing the silver\r\nimage by some other body, and the process can consequently be repeated\r\nmore than once, if sufficient density is not secured by the first\r\napplication. The formula does not seem to be very often used, so it may\r\nbe best to quote it.\r\n\r\n  A. Potassium bromide                    100 grains\r\n     Mercuric chloride                    100   „\r\n     Water                                 10 ozs.\r\n\r\n  B. Potassium cyanide (pure)             100 grains\r\n     Silver nitrate                       100   „\r\n     Water                                 10 ozs.\r\n\r\nPlace the washed negative in A until it has gone white, then rinse it\r\nwell and transfer to B, in which the image turns to a velvety black.\r\nAfter washing, the process can be repeated.\r\n\r\nIntensification is, however, only a way of saving photographs which\r\ncannot be secured again. If the first photograph of a particular\r\nvariety of cloud is not satisfactory, it ought at least to tell the\r\noperator where he had gone wrong, and a second attempt should produce\r\na better result than any image built up by chemical action on an\r\nimperfect base.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing novel in any of these methods, and there is no doubt\r\nthat other formulæ would be as good; but the one thing essential is to\r\nhave a developer whose action can be held under control, and to apply\r\nthat developer in such a way that very considerable over-exposure\r\nwill not result in the ruin of the plate. If a number of photographs\r\nhave been taken in about the same part of the sky, and within a short\r\ntime of each other, then the correct proportions of developer and\r\nalkali will be nearly the same for all, but the first of such a batch\r\nwill always have to be attacked in the cautious step-by-step method.\r\nPatience and perseverance, backed by a steady refusal to be discouraged\r\nby the failures which are at first inevitable, are as certain to be\r\ncrowned by success as they are in other studies.\r\n\r\nThe workers are few, and there is much to be done; for it is mainly to\r\nthose who will photograph the higher clouds, and so trace the stages\r\nof their growth and decay, that we must look for the data which will\r\nenable us to solve the problems they present, and so enlarge the narrow\r\nboundaries of our knowledge of some of the most beautiful things in\r\nNature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. “International Atlas of Clouds” (Atlas International des Nuages).\r\n     Hildebrandsson, Riggenbach, and Teisserenc de Bort.
