The owner of a hundred acres will scarcely step out of\r\nhis way to purchase or to borrow it, while the lord of every smaller\r\nfarm will be sure it is not intended for him. Few persons belonging to\r\nthese several classes have been educated to believe Ten Acres Enough.\r\nBorn to greater ambition, they have aimed higher and grasped at more,\r\nsometimes wisely, sometimes not. Many of these are now owning or\r\ncultivating more land than their heads or purses enable them to manage\r\nproperly. Had their ambition been moderate, and their ideas more\r\npractical, their labor would be better rewarded, and this book, without\r\ndoubt, would have found more readers.\r\n\r\nThe mistaken ambition for owning twice as much land as one can\r\nthoroughly manure or profitably cultivate, is the great agricultural sin\r\nof this country. Those who commit it, by beginning wrong, too frequently\r\ncontinue wrong. Owning many acres is the sole idea. High cultivation of\r\na small tract, is one of which they have little knowledge. Too many in\r\nthese several classes think they know enough. They measure a man’s\r\nknowledge by the number of his acres. Hence, in their eyes the owner of\r\na plot so humble as mine must know so little as to be unable to teach\r\nthem any thing new.\r\n\r\nHappily, it is not for these that I write, and hence it would be\r\nunreasonable to expect them to become readers. I write more particularly\r\nfor those who have not been brought up as farmers--for that numerous\r\nbody of patient toilers in city, town, and village, who, like myself,\r\nhave struggled on from year to year, anxious to break away from the\r\nbondage of the desk, the counter, or the workshop, to realize in the\r\ncountry even a moderate income, so that it be a sure one. Many such are\r\nconstantly looking round in this direction for something which, with\r\nless mental toil and anxiety, will provide a maintenance for a growing\r\nfamily, and afford a refuge for advancing age--some safe and quiet\r\nharbor, sheltered from the constantly recurring monetary and political\r\nconvulsions which in this country so suddenly reduce men to poverty. But\r\nthese inquirers find no experienced pioneers to lead the way, and they\r\nturn back upon themselves, too fearful to go forward alone. Books of\r\npersonal experience like this are rare. This is written for the\r\ninformation of the class referred to, for men not only willing, but\r\nanxious to learn. Once in the same predicament myself, I know their\r\nlongings, their deficiencies, and the steps they ought to take. Hence,\r\nin seeking to make myself fully understood, some may think that I have\r\nbeen unnecessarily minute. But in setting forth my own crudities, I do\r\nbut save others from repeating them. Yet with all this amplification, my\r\nlittle contribution will occasion no crowding even upon a book-shelf\r\nwhich may be already filled.\r\n\r\nI am too new a farmer to be the originator of all the ideas which are\r\nhere set forth. Some, which seemed to be appropriate to the topic in\r\nhand, have been incorporated with the argument as it progressed; while\r\nin some instances, even the language of writers, whose names were\r\nunknown to me, has also been adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\nChapter I.--City Experiences--Moderate Expectations                    9\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.--Practical Views--Safety of Investments in Land           15\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.--Resolved to go--Escape from Business--Choosing a\r\nLocation                                                              22\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--Buying a Farm--Anxiety to sell--Forced to quit           29\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.--Making a Purchase--First Impressions                      37\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.--Planting a Peach-orchard--How to preserve Peach-trees    42\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.--Planting Raspberries and Strawberries--Tricks of\r\nthe Nursery                                                           53\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.--Blackberries--A Remarkable Coincidence                 60\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.--The Garden--Female Management--Comforts and Profits      69\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.--Cheated in a Cow--A Good and a Bad One--The Saint of\r\nthe Barnyard                                                          76\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.--A Cloud of Weeds--Great Sales of Plants                  86\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.--Pigs and Poultry--Luck and Ill Luck                     98\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.--City and Country Life contrasted                      110\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.--Two Acres in Truck--Revolution in Agriculture          118\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.--Birds, and the Services they Render                     131\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.--Close of my First Year--Its Loss and Gain              141\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.--My Second Year--Trenching the Garden--Strawberry\r\nProfits                                                              148\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.--Raspberries--The Lawtons                             167\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.--Liquid Manures--An Illustration                        177\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.--My Third Year--Liquid Manure--Three Years’ Results      188\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.--A Barnyard Manufactory--Land Enough--Faith in Manure   200\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.--Profits of Fruit-growing--The Trade in Berries        212\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.--Gentleman-farming--Establishing a Home               230\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.--Unsuccessful Men--Rebellion not Ruinous to Northern\r\nAgriculture                                                          238\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.--Where to Locate--East or West                          248\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TEN ACRES ENOUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCITY EXPERIENCES--MODERATE EXPECTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy life, up to the age of forty, had been spent in my native city of\r\nPhiladelphia. Like thousands of others before me, I began the world\r\nwithout a dollar, and with a very few friends in a condition to assist\r\nme. Having saved a few hundred dollars by dint of close application to\r\nbusiness, and avoiding taverns, oyster-houses, theatres, and fashionable\r\ntailors, I married and went into business the same year. These two\r\ncontemporaneous drafts upon my little capital proving heavier than I\r\nexpected, they soon used it up, leaving me thereafter greatly straitened\r\nfor means. It is true my business kept me, but as it was constantly\r\nexpanding, and was of such a nature that a large proportion of my annual\r\ngain was necessarily invested in tools, fixtures, and machinery, I was\r\nnearly always short of ready cash to carry on my operations with\r\ncomfort. At certain times, also, it ceased to be profitable. The crisis\r\nof 1837 nearly ruined me, and I was kept struggling along during the\r\nfive succeeding years of hard times, until the revival of 1842 came\r\nround. Previous to this crisis, necessity had driven me to the banks for\r\ndiscounts, one of the sore evils of doing business upon insufficient\r\ncapital. As is always the case with these institutions, they compelled\r\nme to return the borrowed money at the very time it was least convenient\r\nfor me to do so--they needed it as urgently as myself. But to refund\r\nthem I was compelled to borrow elsewhere, and that too at excessive\r\nrates of interest, thus increasing the burden while laboring to shake it\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThousands have gone through the same unhappy experience, and been\r\ncrushed by the load. Such can anticipate my trials and privations. Yet I\r\nwas not insolvent. My property had cost me far more than I owed, yet if\r\noffered for sale at a time when the whole community seemed to want money\r\nonly, no one could have been found to give cost. I could not use it as\r\nthe basis of a loan, neither could I part with it without abandoning my\r\nbusiness. Hence I struggled on through that exhausting crisis, haunted\r\nby perpetual fears of being dishonored at bank,--lying down at night,\r\nnot to peaceful slumber, but to dream of fresh expedients to preserve my\r\ncredit for to-morrow. I have sometimes thought that the pecuniary cares\r\nof that struggle were severe enough to have shortened my life, had they\r\nbeen much longer protracted.\r\n\r\nBesides the mental anxieties they occasioned, they compelled a pinching\r\neconomy in my family. But in this latter effort I discovered my wife to\r\nbe a jewel of priceless value, coming up heroically to the task, and\r\nrelieving me of a world of care. Without her aid, her skill, her\r\nmanagement, her uncomplaining cheerfulness, her sympathy in struggles so\r\ninadequately rewarded as mine were, I should have sunk into utter\r\nbankruptcy. Her economy was not the mean, penny-wise, pound foolish\r\npolicy which many mistake for true economy. It was the art of\r\ncalculation joined to the habit of order, and the power of proportioning\r\nour wishes to the means of gratifying them. The little pilfering temper\r\nof a wife is despicable and odious to every man of sense; but there is a\r\njudicious, graceful economy, which has no connection with an avaricious\r\ntemper, and which, as it depends upon the understanding, can be expected\r\nonly from cultivated minds. Women who have been well educated, far from\r\ndespising domestic duties, will hold them in high respect, because they\r\nwill see that the whole happiness of life is made up of the happiness of\r\neach particular day and hour, and that much of the enjoyment of these\r\nmust depend upon the punctual practice of virtues which are more\r\nvaluable than splendid.\r\n\r\nIf I survived that crisis, it was owing to my wife’s admirable\r\nmanagement of my household expenses. She saw that our embarrassment was\r\ndue to no imprudence or neglect of mine. She thus consented to severe\r\nprivations, uttering no complaint, hinting no reproach, never\r\ndisheartened, and so rarely out of humor that she never failed to\r\nwelcome my return with a smile.\r\n\r\nBut in this country one convulsion follows another with disheartening\r\nfrequency. I lived through that of 1837, paid my debts, and had managed\r\nto save some money. My wife’s system of economy had been so long adhered\r\nto, that in the end it became to some extent habitual to her, and she\r\nstill continued to practise great frugality. I became insensibly\r\naccustomed to it myself. Children were multiplying around us, and we\r\nthought the skies had brightened for all future time. When in\r\ndifficulty, we had often debated the propriety of quitting the city and\r\nits terrible business trials, and settling on a few acres in the\r\ncountry, where we could raise our own food, and spend the remainder of\r\nour days in cultivating ground which would be sure to yield us at least\r\na respectable subsistence. We had no longing for excessive wealth: a\r\nmere competency, though earned by daily toil, so that it was reasonably\r\nsure, and free from the drag of continued indebtedness to others, was\r\nall we coveted.\r\n\r\nI had always loved the country, but my wife preferred the city. I could\r\ntake no step but such as would be likely to promote her happiness. So\r\nlong as times continued fair, we ceased to canvass the propriety of a\r\nremoval. We had children to educate, and to her the city seemed the best\r\nand most convenient place for qualifying them for future usefulness.\r\nThen, most of our relations resided near us. Our habits were eminently\r\nsocial. We had made numerous friends, and among our neighbors there had\r\nturned up many valuable families. We felt even the thought of breaking\r\naway from all these cordial ties to be a trying one. But the refuge of a\r\nremoval to the country had taken strong hold of my mind.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may be said that I was born with a passion for living on a\r\nfarm. It was fixed and strengthened by my long experience of the\r\nbusiness vicissitudes of city life. For many years I had been a constant\r\nsubscriber for several agricultural journals, whose contents I read as\r\ncarefully as I did those of the daily papers. My wife also, being a\r\ngreat reader, came in time to study them almost as attentively. Every\r\nthing I saw in them only tended to confirm my longing for the country,\r\nwhile they gave definite views of what kind of farming I was fit for. In\r\nfact they educated me for the position before I assumed it. I am sure\r\nthey exercised a powerful influence in removing most of my wife’s\r\nobjections to living in the country. I studied their contents as\r\ncarefully as did the writers who prepared them. I watched the reports of\r\ncrops, of experiments, and of profits. The leading idea in my mind was\r\nthis--that a man of ordinary industry and intelligence, by choosing a\r\nproper location within hourly reach of a great city market, could so\r\ncultivate a few acres as to insure a maintenance for his family, free\r\nfrom the ruinous vibrations of trade or commerce in the metropolis. All\r\nmy reading served to convince me of its soundness. I did not assume that\r\nhe could get rich on the few acres which I ever expected to own; but I\r\nfelt assured that he could place himself above want. I knew that his\r\npeace of mind would be sure. With me this was dearer than all. My\r\nreading had satisfied me that such a man would find Ten Acres Enough,\r\nand these I could certainly command.\r\n\r\nAs I did not contemplate undertaking the management of a large grain\r\nfarm, so my studies did not run in that direction. Yet I read every\r\nthing that came before me in relation to such, and not without profit.\r\nBut I graduated my views to my means, and so noted with the utmost care\r\nthe experiences of the small cultivators who farmed five to ten acres\r\nthoroughly. I noted their failures as watchfully as their successes,\r\nknowing that the former were to be avoided, as the latter were to be\r\nimitated. As opportunity offered, I made repeated excursions, year after\r\nyear, in every direction around Philadelphia, visiting the small farmers\r\nor truckers who supplied the city market with fruit and vegetables,\r\nexamining, inquiring, and treasuring up all that I saw and heard. The\r\nfund of knowledge thus acquired was not only prodigious, but it has been\r\nof lasting value to me in my subsequent operations. I found multitudes\r\nof truckers who were raising large families on five acres of ground,\r\nwhile others, owning only thirty acres, had become rich.\r\n\r\nOn most of these numerous excursions I was careful to have my wife with\r\nme. I wanted her to see and hear for herself, and by convincing her\r\njudgment, to overcome her evidently diminishing reluctance to leaving\r\nthe city. My uniform consideration for her comfort at last secured the\r\nobject I had in view. She saw so many homes in which a quiet abundance\r\nwas found, so many contented men and women, so many robust and bouncing\r\nchildren, that long before I was ready to leave the city, she was quite\r\nimpatient to be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL VIEWS--SAFETY OF INVESTMENTS IN LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was not a particle of romance in my aspirations for a farm,\r\nneither had I formed a single visionary theory which was there to be\r\ntested. My notions were all sober and prosaic. I had struggled all my\r\nlife for dollars, because abundance of them produces pecuniary comfort:\r\nand the change to country life was to be, in reality, a mere\r\ncontinuation of the struggle, but lightened by the assurance that if the\r\ndollars thus to be acquired were fewer in number, the certainty of\r\nearning enough of them was likely to be greater. Crops might fail under\r\nskies at one time too watery, at another too brassy, but no such\r\ndisaster could equal those to which commercial pursuits are\r\nuninterruptedly exposed. They have brassy skies above them as well as\r\nfarmers. For nearly twenty years I had been hampered with having notes\r\nof my own or of other parties to pay; but of all the farmers I had\r\nvisited, only one had ever given a note, and he had made a vow never to\r\ngive another. My wife was shrewd enough to observe and remark on this\r\nfact at the time, it was so different from my own experience. She\r\nadmitted there must be some satisfaction in carrying on a business which\r\ndid not require the giving of notes.\r\n\r\nLooking at the matter of removal to the country in a practical light, I\r\nfound that in the city I was paying three hundred dollars per annum rent\r\nfor a dwelling-house. It was the interest of five thousand dollars; yet\r\nit afforded nothing but a shelter for my family. I might continue to pay\r\nthat rent for fifty years, without, at the end of that time, having\r\nacquired the ownership of either a stone upon the chimney, or a shingle\r\nin the roof. If the house rose in value, the rise would be to the\r\nowner’s benefit, not to mine. It would really be injurious to me, as the\r\nrise would lead him to demand an increase of his rent. But put the value\r\nof the house into a farm, or even the half of it--the farm would have a\r\ndwelling-house upon it, in which my family would find as good a shelter,\r\nwhile the land, if cultivated as industriously as I had always\r\ncultivated business, would belie the flood of evidence I had been\r\nstudying for many years, if it failed to yield to my efforts the returns\r\nwhich it was manifestly returning to others. We could live contentedly\r\non a thousand dollars a year, and here we should have no landlord to\r\npay. My wife, in pinching times, has financiered us through the year on\r\nseveral hundred less. I confess to having lived as well on the\r\ndiminished rations as I wanted to. Indeed, until one tries it for\r\nhimself, it is incredible what dignity there is in an old hat, what\r\nvirtue in a time-worn coat, and how savory the dinner-table can be made\r\nwithout sirloin steaks or cranberry tarts.\r\n\r\nThus, let it be remembered, my views and aspirations had no tinge of\r\nextravagance. My rule was moderation. The tortures of a city struggle\r\nwithout capital, had sobered me down to being contented with a bare\r\ncompetency. I might fail in some particulars at the outset, from\r\nignorance, but I was in the prime of life, strong, active, industrious,\r\nand tractable, and what I did not know I could soon learn from others,\r\nfor farmers have no secrets. Then I had seen too much of the uncertainty\r\nof banks and stocks, and ledger accounts, and promissory notes, to be\r\nwilling to invest any thing in either as a permanency. At best they are\r\nfluctuating and uncertain, up to-day and down to-morrow. My great\r\npreference had always been for land.\r\n\r\nIn looking around among my wide circle of city acquaintances, especially\r\namong the older families, I could not fail to notice that most of them\r\nhad grown rich by the ownership of land. More than once had I seen the\r\nvalues of all city property, improved and unimproved, apparently\r\ndisappear;--lots without purchasers, and houses without tenants, the\r\ncommunity so poor and panic-stricken that real estate became the merest\r\ndrug. Yesterday the collapse was caused by the destruction of the\r\nNational Bank; to-day it is the Tariff. Sheriffs played havoc with\r\nhouses and lands incumbered by mortgages, and lawyers fattened on the\r\nrich harvest of fees inaugurated by a Bankrupt Law. But those who,\r\nundismayed by the wreck around them, courageously held on to land, came\r\nthrough in safety. The storm, having run its course and exhausted its\r\nwrath, gave place to skies commercially serene, and real estate swung\r\nback with an irrepressible momentum to its former value, only to keep on\r\nadvancing to one even greater.\r\n\r\nI became convinced that safety lay in the ownership of land. In all my\r\ninquiries both before leaving the city, as well as since, I rarely heard\r\nof a farmer becoming insolvent. When I did, and was careful to ascertain\r\nthe cause, it turned out that he had either begun in debt, and was thus\r\nhampered at the beginning, or had made bad bargains in speculations\r\noutside of his calling, or wasted his means in riotous living, or had in\r\nsome way utterly neglected his business. If not made rich by heavy\r\ncrops, I could find none who had been made poor by bad ones.\r\n\r\nThe reader may look back over every monetary convulsion he may be able\r\nto remember, and he will find that in all of them the agricultural\r\ncommunity came through with less disaster than any other interest. Wheat\r\ngrows and corn ripens though all the banks in the world may break, for\r\nseed-time and harvest is one of the divine promises to man, never to be\r\nbroken, because of its divine origin. They grew and ripened before banks\r\nwere invented, and will continue to do so when banks and railroad bonds\r\nshall have become obsolete.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the earthly fund for whose acquisition we are all striving, we\r\nnaturally desire to make a permanent one. As we have worked for it, so\r\nwe trust that it will work for us and our children. Its value, whatever\r\nthat may be, depends on its perpetuity--the continuance of its\r\nexistence. A man seeks to earn what will support and serve not only\r\nhimself, but his posterity. He would naturally desire to have the estate\r\ndescend to children and grandchildren. This is one great object of his\r\ntoil. What, then, is the safest fund in which to invest, in this\r\ncountry? What is the only fund which the experience of the last fifty\r\nyears has shown, with very few exceptions, would be absolutely safe as a\r\nprovision for heirs? How many men, within that period, assuming to act\r\nas trustees for estates, have kept the trust fund invested in stocks,\r\nand when distributing the principal among the heirs, have found that\r\nmost of it had vanished! Under corporate insolvency it had melted into\r\nair. No prudent man, accepting such a trust, and guaranteeing its\r\nintegrity, would invest the fund in stocks.\r\n\r\nOur country is filled with pecuniary wrecks from causes like this.\r\nThousands trust themselves during their lifetime, to manage this\r\ndescription of property, confident of their caution and sagacity. With\r\nclose watching and good luck, they may be equal to the task; but the\r\nquestion still occurs as to the probable duration of such a fund in\r\nfamilies. What is its safety when invested in the current stocks of the\r\ncountry? and next, what is its safety in the hands of heirs? There are\r\nno statistics showing the probable continuance of estates in land in\r\nfamilies, and of estates composed of personal property, such as stocks.\r\nBut every bank cashier will testify to one remarkable fact--that an heir\r\nno sooner inherits stock in the bank than the first thing he generally\r\ndoes is to sell and transfer it, and that such sale is most frequently\r\nthe first notice given of the holder’s death.\r\n\r\nThis preference for investment in real estate will doubtless be objected\r\nto by the young and dashing business man. But lands, or a fund secured\r\nby real estate, is unquestionably not only the highest security, but in\r\nthe hands of heirs it is the only one likely to survive a single\r\ngeneration. Hence the wisdom of the common law, which neither permits\r\nthe guardian to sell the lands of his ward, nor even the court, in its\r\ndiscretion, to grant authority for their sale, except upon sufficient\r\ngrounds shown,--as a necessity for raising a fund for the support and\r\neducation of the ward. Even a lord chancellor can only touch so sacred a\r\nfund for this or similar reasons. The common law is wise on this\r\nsubject, as on most others. It is thus the experience and observation of\r\nmankind that such a fund is the safest, and hence the provisions of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThose, therefore, who acquire personal property, acquire only what will\r\nlast about a generation, longer or shorter. Such property is quickly\r\nconverted into money--it perishes and is gone. But land is hedged round\r\nwith numerous guards which protect it from hasty spoliation. It is not\r\nso easily transferred; it is not so secretly transferred; the law\r\nenjoins deliberate formalities before it can be alienated, and often the\r\nconsent of various parties is necessary. When all other guards give way,\r\nearly memories of parental attachment to these ancestral acres, or\r\ntender reminiscences of childhood, will come in to stay the spoliation\r\nof the homestead, and make even the prodigal pause before giving up this\r\nportion of his inheritance.\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe a passion to become the owner of land is universal,\r\nwhile the difficulty of gratifying it is infinitely greater than with\r\nus. It is there enormously dear; here it is absurdly cheap. It is from\r\nthis universal passion that the vast annual immigration to this country\r\nderives its mighty impulse. As it reaches our shores it spreads itself\r\nover the country in search of cheap land. Many of the most flourishing\r\nWestern States have been built up by the astonishing influx of\r\nimmigrants. In England, every landowner is prompt to secure every\r\nfreehold near him, be it large or small, as it comes into market. Hence\r\nthe number of freeholders in that country is annually diminishing by\r\nthis process of absorption. This European passion for acquiring land is\r\nstrangely contrasted with the American passion for parting with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRESOLVED TO GO--ESCAPE FROM BUSINESS--CHOOSING A LOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last thirty years have been prolific of great pecuniary convulsions.\r\nI need not recapitulate them here, as too many of them are yet dark\r\nspots on the memory of some who will read this. Their frequency, as well\r\nas their recurrence at shorter intervals than at the beginning of the\r\ncentury, are among their most remarkable features, baffling the\r\ncalculations of older heads, and confounding those of younger ones. As\r\nthe century advanced, these convulsions increased in number and\r\nviolence. The whole business horizon seemed full of coming storms, which\r\nburst successively with desolating severity, not only on merchants and\r\nmanufacturers, but on others who had long before retired from business.\r\nNo one could foresee this state of things. I will not stop to argue\r\ncauses, but confine myself to facts which none will care to contradict.\r\n\r\nThese disasters made beggars of thousands in every branch of business,\r\nand spread discouragement over every community. I passed through several\r\nof them, striving and struggling, and oppressed beyond all power of\r\ndescription. How many more the community was to encounter I did not\r\nknow; but I conceived it the part of prudence to place myself beyond\r\nthe circle of their influence before I also had been prostrated.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the losses thus encountered, I had been saving something\r\nannually for several years, when the stricture of 1854 came on,\r\npremonitory of the tremendous crash of 1857. Most unfortunately for my\r\ncomfort, that stricture seemed to fall with peculiar severity on a class\r\nof dealers largely indebted to me. Many of them became embarrassed, and\r\nfailed to pay me at the time, while to this day some of them are still\r\nmy debtors. My old experiences of raising money revived, and to some\r\nextent I was compelled to go through the humiliations of similar\r\nperiods. But the stricture was of brief duration, and I closed the year\r\nin far better condition than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\nBut the trials of that incipient crisis determined me to abandon the\r\ncity. I found that by realizing all I then possessed, I could command\r\nmeans enough to purchase ten to twenty acres, and I had grown nervous\r\nand apprehensive of the future. While possessed of a little, I resolved\r\nto make that little sure by investing it in land. I had worked for the\r\nlandlord long enough. My excellent wife was now entirely willing to make\r\nthe change, and our six children clapped their hands with joy when they\r\nheard that “father was going to live in the country.”\r\n\r\nI had long determined in my mind what sort of farming was likely to\r\nprove profitable enough to keep us with comfort, and that was the\r\nraising of small fruits for the city markets. My attention had always\r\nbeen particularly directed to the berries. Some strawberries I had\r\nraised in my city garden with prodigious success. My friends, when they\r\nheard of my project, expressed fears that the market would soon be\r\nglutted, not exactly by the crops which I was to raise, but they could\r\nnot exactly answer how. They confessed that they were extremely fond of\r\nberries, and that at no time in the season could they afford to eat\r\nenough; a confession which seemed to explode all apprehension of the\r\nmarket being overstocked.\r\n\r\nBut my wife and myself had both examined the hucksters who called at the\r\ndoor with small fruits, as to the monstrous prices they demanded, and\r\nhad begged them, if ever a glut occurred, that they would call and let\r\nus know. But none had ever called with such information. It was the same\r\nthing with those who occupied stalls in the various city markets. They\r\nrarely had a surplus left unsold, and their prices were always high. A\r\nglut of fruit was a thing almost unknown to them. It was a safe\r\npresumption that the market would not be depressed by the quantity that\r\nI might raise.\r\n\r\nBut here let me say something by way of parenthesis, touching this\r\ncommon idea of the danger of overstocking the fruit-market of the great\r\ncities. It is a curious fact that this idea is entertained only by those\r\nwho are not fruit-growers. The latter never harbored it. Their whole\r\nexperience runs the other way, they know it to be a gross absurdity. Yet\r\nsomehow, the question of a glut has always been debated. Twenty years\r\nago the nurserymen were advised to close up their sales and abandon the\r\nbusiness, as they would soon have no customers for trees--everybody was\r\nsupplied. But trees have continued to be planted from that day to this,\r\nand where hundreds were sold twenty years ago, thousands are disposed of\r\nnow. Old-established nurseries have been trebled in size, while\r\ncountless new ones have been planted. The nursery business has grown to\r\na magnitude truly gigantic, because the market for fruit has been\r\nannually growing larger, and no business enlarges itself unless it is\r\nproved to be profitable.\r\n\r\nThe market cannot be glutted with good fruit. The multiplication of\r\nmouths to consume it is far more rapid than the increase of any supply\r\nthat growers can effect. Within ten years the masses have had a slight\r\ntaste of choice fruits, and but little more. Indulgence has only served\r\nto whet their appetites. The more of them there is offered in the\r\nmarket, the more will there be consumed. Every huckster in her shamble,\r\nevery vender of peanuts in the street, will testify to this. The modern\r\nart of semi-cookery for fruit, and of preserving it in cans and jars,\r\nhas made sale for enormous quantities of those choicer kinds which\r\nreturn the highest profit to the grower. It is in the grain-market that\r\npanic often rages, but never in the fruit-market. If it ever enters the\r\nlatter, the struggle is to obtain the fruit, not to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe proper choice of a location was now to be the great question of my\r\nfuture success. I had determined on giving my attention to the raising\r\nof the smaller fruits for the great markets of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia. I must therefore be somewhere on or near the railroad\r\nbetween those cities, and as near as possible to a station. The soil of\r\nPennsylvania, near Philadelphia, was too heavy for some of the lighter\r\nfruits. New Jersey, with its admirable sandy loam light, warm, and of\r\nsurprisingly easy tillage, was proverbially adapted for the growth of\r\nall market produce, whether fruit or vegetable, and was at the same time\r\na week or two earlier. Land was far cheaper, there was no State debt,\r\ntaxes were merely nominal, and an acre that could be bought for thirty\r\ndollars could be made four times as productive as an acre of the best\r\nwheat land in Pennsylvania. Such results are regularly realized by\r\nhundreds of Jerseymen from year to year.\r\n\r\nIt was also of easy access from the city for manure-boats. Every town\r\nwithin the range of my wants was well supplied with churches, schools,\r\nand stores, together with an intelligent and moral population. I should\r\nbe surrounded by desirable neighbors, while an hour’s ride by steamboat\r\nor railroad would place me, many times daily, among all my ancient\r\nfriends in the city. We should by no means become hermits. I knew the\r\ncountry so well from my numerous visits among the fruit-growers, when in\r\nsearch of information, as to anticipate but little difficulty in finding\r\nthe proper location.\r\n\r\nBy the mere accident of a slight revival in business in the early part\r\nof 1855, a party came along who was thus induced to purchase my stock\r\nand machinery. Luckily, he was able to pay down the whole amount in\r\ncash. I received what I considered at the time an excellent price; but\r\nwhen I came to settle up my accounts and pay what I owed, I found, to\r\nmy extreme disappointment, that but a little over two thousand dollars\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThis sum was the net gain of many years of most laborious toil. Was it\r\npossible for farming to be a worse business than this? I had made ten\r\ntimes as much, but my losses had been terrible. This, with my personal\r\ncredit, was all the surplus I had saved. I remember now, that when thus\r\ndiscovering myself to be worth so little, I half regretted having given\r\nup my business for what then appeared to me so inadequate a sum. When\r\nselling, I was jubilant and thankful--when settled up, I was full of\r\nregrets. I ought to have had more. So difficult is it for the human mind\r\nto be satisfied with that which is really best.\r\n\r\nBut I little knew what the future was to bring forth, and how soon my\r\nwant of thankfulness was to be changed into the profoundest conviction\r\nthat I had providentially escaped from total ruin, and come out\r\ncomparatively rich. I had made myself snug upon my little farm when the\r\ntornado of 1857 toppled my former establishment into utter ruin. My\r\nsuccessor was made a bankrupt, and his business was destroyed, leaving\r\nhim overwhelmed with debt. He had lost all, while I had saved all. Had I\r\nnot sold when I did, and secured what the sale yielded me, I too should\r\nhave been among the wrecks of that terrific visitation.\r\n\r\nBut I heard its warring in the quiet of my little farm-house, where it\r\nbrought me neither anxiety nor loss. My position was like that of one\r\nsitting peacefully by his wintry fireside, gazing on the thick storm\r\nwithout, and listening to the patter of the snow-flakes as the tempest\r\ndrove them angrily against the window-pane, while all within was calm\r\nand genial. Instead of regrets for what I had failed to grasp, my heart\r\noverflowed with thankfulness for the comparative abundance that remained\r\nto me. My peace of mind was perfect. The unspeakable satisfaction was\r\nfelt of being out of business, out of debt, out of danger--not rich, but\r\npossessed of enough. The thoughtful reader may well believe that\r\nsubsequent disturbances, rebellion, war, and even a more wide-spread\r\nbankruptcy--from all which my humble position made me secure--have only\r\nserved to intensify my gratitude to that Divine Providence which so\r\nmercifully shaped my ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBUYING A FARM--A LONG SEARCH--ANXIETY TO SELL--FORCED TO QUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already stated, I had in round numbers a clear two thousand dollars,\r\nwith which to buy and stock a farm, and keep my family while my first\r\ncrops were growing. As I was entirely free from debt, so I determined to\r\navoid it in the future. Debt had been the bitter portion of my life, not\r\nfrom choice, but of necessity. My wife took strong ground in support of\r\nthis resolution--what we had she wanted us to keep. I had too long been\r\naided by her admirable counsel to reject it now. She had a singular\r\nlonging for seeing me my own landlord. Her resolution was a powerful\r\nstrengthener of my own convictions.\r\n\r\nThus resolved, we set out in the early part of March to seek a home. I\r\nwas particular to take my wife with me--I wanted her to aid in choosing\r\nit. She was to occupy it as well as myself. She knew exactly what we\r\nwanted as regarded the dwelling-house,--the land department she left\r\nentirely to my judgment. I was determined that she should be made\r\ncomfortable from the start, not only because she deserved to be made so,\r\nbut to make sure that no cause for future discontent should arise.\r\nIndeed, she was really the best judge in this matter. She knew what the\r\nsix children needed; she was the model of a housekeeper; there were\r\ncertain little conveniences indispensable to domestic comfort to be\r\nsecured, of which she knew more than I did, while her judgment on most\r\nthings was so correct, that I felt confident if she were fully\r\nsatisfied, the whole enterprise would be a successful one.\r\n\r\nI loved her with the fervor of early married life--she had consented to\r\nmy plans--she was willing to share whatever inconveniences might belong\r\nto our new position--was able to lighten them by her unflagging\r\ncheerfulness and thrift--and I was unwilling to take a single step in\r\nopposition either to her wishes or her judgment. Indeed, I had long\r\nsince made up my mind, from observation of the good or bad luck of other\r\nmen, that he who happens to be blessed with a wife possessing good sense\r\nand good judgment, succeeds or fails in life according as he is\r\naccustomed to consult her in his business enterprises. There is a world\r\nof caution, shrewdness, and latent wisdom in such women, which their\r\nhusbands too frequently disregard to their ruin.\r\n\r\nI am thus particular as to all my experiences; for this is really a\r\ndomestic story, intended for the multitudes who have suffered half a\r\nlifetime from trials similar to mine, and who yet feel ungratified\r\nlongings for some avenue of escape. My object being to point out that\r\nthrough which I emerged from such a life to one of certainty and\r\ncomfort, the detail ought to be valuable, even if it fail to be\r\ninteresting. It is possible that I may sink the practical in the\r\nenthusiastic, and prove myself to be unduly enamored of my choice. But\r\nas it is success that makes the hero, so let my experience be accepted\r\nas the test.\r\n\r\nI had settled it in my mind that I would use thousand dollars in the\r\npurchase of land, and that I could make Ten Acres Enough. This I was\r\ndetermined to pay for at once, and have it covered by no man’s\r\nparchment. But when we set out on our search, we found some\r\ndifficulties. Every county in New Jersey contained a hundred farms that\r\nwere for sale. Most of them were too large for my slender purse, though\r\notherwise most eligibly situated. Then we must have a decent house, even\r\nif we were forced to put up with less land. Numerous locations of this\r\nkind were offered. The trouble was--keeping my slender purse in\r\nview--that the farms were either too large or too small. My wife was not\r\nfastidious about having a fine house. On the contrary, I was often\r\nsurprised to find her pleased with such as to me looked small and mean.\r\nIndeed, it seemed, after ten days’ search, that the tables had been\r\nturned--she was more easily suited than myself. But the same deference\r\nwhich I paid to her wishes, she uniformly paid to mine.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to note the anxiety of so many landowners to sell, and to\r\nhear the discordant reasons which they gave for desiring to do so. The\r\nquantity in market was enormous. All the real-estate agents had large\r\nbooks filled with descriptions of farms and fancy country-seats for\r\nsale, some to be had by paying one-fourth of the purchase-money down,\r\nand some which the owners would exchange for merchandise, or traps, or\r\nhouses in the city. Many of them appeared simply to want something else\r\nfor what they already had. They were tired of holding, and desired a\r\nchange of some kind, better if they could make it, and worse if they\r\ncould not. City merchants, or thriving mechanics, had built country\r\ncottages, and then wearied of them--it was found inconvenient to be\r\ngoing to and fro--in fact, they had soon discovered that the city alone\r\nwas their place. Many such told us that their wives did not like the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOthers had bought farms and spent great sums in improving them, only to\r\nsell at a loss. Farming did not pay an owner who lived away off in the\r\ncity. Another class had taken land for debt, and wanted to realize. They\r\nexpected to lose anyhow, and would sell cheap. Then there was another\r\nbody of owners who, though born and raised upon the land, were tired of\r\ncountry life, and wanted to sell and embark in business in the city.\r\nSome few were desirous of going to the West. Change of some kind seemed\r\nto be the general craving. As I discovered that much of all this land\r\nwas covered with mortgages of greater or less amount, it was natural to\r\nsuppose the sheriff would occasionally turn up, and so it really was.\r\nThere were columns in some of the county papers filled with his\r\nadvertisements. I sometimes thought the whole country was for sale.\r\n\r\nBut yet there was a vast body of owners, many of them descendants of the\r\nearly settlers, whom no consideration of price could tempt to abandon\r\ntheir inheritances. They seemed to know and understand the value of\r\ntheir ancestral acres. We met with other parties, recent purchasers,\r\nwho had bought for a permanency, and who could not be induced to sell.\r\nIn short, there seemed to be two constantly flowing streams of\r\npeople--one tending from city to country, the other from country to\r\ncity. Doubtless it is the same way with all our large cities. I think\r\nthe latter stream was the larger. If it were not so, our cities could\r\nnot grow in population at a rate so much more rapid than the country. At\r\nnumerous farm-houses inquiries were made if we knew of any openings in\r\nthe city in which boys and young men could be placed. The city was\r\nevidently the coveted goal with too large a number.\r\n\r\nThis glut of the land-market did not discourage us. We could not be\r\ninduced to believe that land had no value because so many were anxious\r\nto dispose of it. We saw that it did not suit those who held it, and\r\nknew that it would suit us. But we could not but lament over the\r\ninfatuation of many owners, who we felt certain would be ruined by\r\nturning their wide acres into money, and exposing it to the hazards of\r\nan untried business in the city. I doubt not that many of the very\r\nparties we then encountered have, long before this, realized the sad\r\nfate we feared, and learned too late that lands are better than\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about the middle of March, we found the very spot we had\r\nbeen seeking. It lay upon the Amboy Railroad, within a few miles of\r\nPhiladelphia, within gunshot of a railroad station, and on the outskirts\r\nof a town containing churches, schools, and stores, with quite an\r\neducated society. The grounds comprised eleven acres, and the\r\ndwelling-house was quite large enough for my family. It struck the fancy\r\nof my wife the moment we came up to it; and when she had gone over the\r\nhouse, looked into the kitchen, explored the cellar, and walked round\r\nthe garden, she expressed the strongest desire to make it our home.\r\n\r\nThere was barn enough to accommodate a horse and cow, with a ton or two\r\nof hay, quite an extensive shed, and I noticed that the barnyard\r\ncontained a good pile of manure which was to go with the property. The\r\nbuildings were of modern date, the fences were good, and there was\r\nevidence that a former occupant had exercised a taste for fruit and\r\nornamental trees, while the garden was in very fair condition. But the\r\nland had been wholly neglected. All outside of the garden was a perfect\r\nscarecrow of tall weeds, thousands of which stood clear up to the fence\r\ntop, making sure that they had scattered seeds enough for twenty future\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nBut I noticed that the land directly opposite was in the most admirable\r\ncondition, and I saw at a glance that the soil must be adapted to the\r\nvery purpose to which it was to be applied. The opposite ground was\r\nmatted with a luxuriant growth of strawberries, while rows of stalwart\r\nraspberries held up their vigorous canes in testimony of the goodness of\r\nthe soil. A fine peach-orchard on the same neighboring property, seemed\r\nimpatient to put forth and blossom unto harvest. The eleven acres could\r\nbe no worse land than this, and though I had a horror of weeds, yet I\r\nwas not to be frightened by them. I knew that weeds were more\r\nindigenous to New Jersey than even watermelons.\r\n\r\nThis miniature plantation of eleven acres belonged to a merchant in the\r\ncity. He had taken it to secure a debt of eleven hundred dollars, but\r\nhad pledged himself to pay the former owner whatever excess over that\r\nsum he might obtain for it. But pledges of that loose character seldom\r\namount to much--the creditor consults his own interest, not that of the\r\ndebtor. The latter had long been trying to sell, but in vain; and now\r\nthe former had become equally embarrassed, and needed money even more\r\nurgently than the debtor had done. The whole property had cost the\r\ndebtor eighteen hundred dollars. His views in founding it were similar\r\nto mine. He meant to establish for himself a home, to which at some\r\nfuture period he might retire. But he made the sad mistake of continuing\r\nin business in the city, and one disaster succeeding another, he had\r\nbeen compelled to abandon his anticipated refuge nearly a year before we\r\ncame along.\r\n\r\nAll these facts I learned before beginning to negotiate for the\r\npurchase. As the banished man related them to me, going largely into the\r\nhistory of his hopes, his trials, his disappointments, I found cause for\r\nrenewed thankfulness over my superior condition. With a single\r\nexception, his experience had been the counterpart of my own--he had\r\nlost all and was loaded with debt, while I had saved something and owed\r\nno man. But when, in language of the tenderest feeling, he spoke of his\r\nwife, whose highest passion had been gratified by the possession of a\r\nhome so humble as even this--when he described how happy she had been in\r\nher garden, and how grief-stricken at being compelled to leave it--his\r\neloquence fairly made my heart ache. I am sure my wife felt the full\r\nforce of all he said. Her own attachment to the spot had already begun\r\nto take root, and she could sympathize with this rude sundering of a\r\nlong-established tie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMAKING A PURCHASE--FIRST IMPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owner of these eleven acres had been for some months in the furnace\r\nof pecuniary affliction. He was going the way of nine-tenths of all the\r\nbusiness flesh within the circle of my acquaintance. As a purchaser I\r\ndid not seek him, nor to his representative did myself or my wife let\r\nfall a single word indicating that we were pleased with the property.\r\nWhen fifteen hundred dollars were named as the price, I did indulge in\r\nsome expression of surprise, thinking it was quite enough. Discovering\r\nsubsequently that the owner was an old city acquaintance, I dropped in\r\none morning to see him, and for an hour we talked over the times, the\r\nmarkets, the savage rates demanded for money, and how the spring\r\nbusiness was likely to turn out. On real estate I was mute as a mouse,\r\nexcept giving it as my decided opinion that some holders were asking\r\ngreater prices than they would be likely to realize.\r\n\r\nThis side-thrust brought my friend out. He mentioned his house and\r\neleven acres, and eagerly inquired if I did not know of some one who\r\nwould buy. With as much indifference as I could assume, I asked his\r\nterms. He told me with great frankness that he was compelled to sell,\r\nand that his need of money was so great, that he might possibly do so\r\nwhether the debtor got any thing or not. He urged me to find him a\r\npurchaser, and finally gave me the refusal of the place for a few days.\r\n\r\nNow, the plain truth was, that my anxiety to buy was quite as great as\r\nhis was to sell. During the next week we met several times, when he\r\ninvariably inquired as to the prospect of a purchaser. But I had no\r\nencouragement to offer. When I thought I had fought shy long enough, I\r\nsurprised him by saying that I knew of a purchaser who was ready to take\r\nthe property at a thousand dollars. He sat down and indulged in some\r\nfiguring, then for a few moments was silent, then inquired if the offer\r\nwas a cash one, and when the money could be had. I replied, the moment\r\nhis deed was ready for delivery.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the offer of instant payment determined him to sell\r\nat so low a price--cash was every thing. Opening his desk, he took out a\r\ndeed for the property, ready to execute whenever the grantee’s name, the\r\ndate and the consideration should have been inserted, handed it to me,\r\nand said he accepted the offer, only let him have the money as quickly\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nI confess to both exultation and surprise. I had secured an unmistakable\r\nbargain. The ready-made deed surprised me, but it showed the owner’s\r\nnecessities, and that he had been prepared to let the property go at the\r\nfirst decent offer. The natural selfishness of human nature has since\r\ninduced me to believe that I could have bought for even less, had I not\r\nbeen so precipitate. His searches and brief of title were also ready: a\r\nsingle day or two was enough to bring them up--he had been determined\r\nto sell.\r\n\r\nThe transaction seemed to involve a succession of surprises. His turn\r\nfor a new one came when he found that I had inserted my wife’s name in\r\nthe deed. So, paying him his thousand dollars, I returned with the deed\r\nto my wife, telling her that she had now a home of her own; that, come\r\nwhat might, the property was hers; that the laws of New Jersey secured\r\nit to her, and that no subsequent destitution of mine could wrest it\r\nfrom her. This little act of consideration was as gratifying a surprise\r\nto her as any that either buyer or seller had experienced. If rejoiced\r\nat my having secured the place, it gave to it a new interest in her\r\nestimation, and fixed and made permanent the attachment she had\r\nspontaneously acquired for it. Her gratification only served to increase\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that small acts of kindness make life pleasant and desirable.\r\nEvery dark object is made light by them, and many scalding tears of\r\nsorrow are thus easily brushed away. When the heart is sad, and\r\ndespondency sits at the entrance of the soul, a little kindness drives\r\ndespair away, and makes the path cheerful and pleasant. Who then will\r\nrefuse a kind act? It costs the giver nothing--just as this did; but it\r\nis invaluable to the receiver. No broader acres, no more stately\r\nmansion, whether in town or country, could now tempt my wife to leave\r\nthis humble refuge. Here she has been ever happy, and here, I doubt not,\r\nshe will end her earthly career.\r\n\r\nIn a week the house was vacated and cleansed, and we were in full\r\npossession. My wife was satisfied, my children were delighted, and I had\r\nrealized the dream of twenty years! One strong fact forced itself on my\r\nattention the first night I passed under my new roof. The drain of three\r\nhundred dollars per annum into the pocket of my city landlord had been\r\nstopped. My family received as safe a shelter for the interest of a\r\nthousand dollars, as he had given them for the interest of five\r\nthousand! The feeling of relief from this unappeasable demand was\r\nindescribable. Curiously enough, my wife voluntarily suggested that the\r\nsame feeling of relief had been presented to her. But in addition to\r\nthis huge equivalent for the investment of a thousand dollars, there was\r\nthat which might be hereafter realized from the cultivation of eleven\r\nacres of land.\r\n\r\nThis lodgment was effected on the first of April, 1855. When all our\r\nhousehold fixings had been snugly arranged, and I took my first walk\r\nover my little plantation, on a soft and balmy morning, my feeling of\r\ncontentment seemed to be perfect. I knew that I was not rich, but it was\r\ncertain that I was not poor. In contrasting my condition with that of\r\nothers, both higher and lower upon fortune’s ladder, I found a thousand\r\ncauses for congratulation, but none for regret. With all his wealth,\r\nRothschild must be satisfied with the same sky that was spread over me.\r\nHe cannot order a private sunrise, that he may enjoy it with a select\r\ncircle of friends, nor add a single glory to the gorgeous spectacle of\r\nthe setting sun. The millionaire could not have more than his share of\r\nthe pure atmosphere that I was breathing, while the poorest of all men\r\ncould have as much. God only can give all these, and to many of the poor\r\nhe has thus given. All that is most valuable can be had for nothing.\r\nThey come as presents from the hand of an indulgent Father, and neither\r\nair nor sky, nor beauty, genius, health, or strength, can be bought or\r\nsold. Whatever may be one’s condition in life, the great art is to learn\r\nto be content and happy, indulging in no feverish longings for what we\r\nhave not, but satisfied and thankful for what we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPLANTING A PEACH ORCHARD--HOW TO PRESERVE PEACH-TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the season for me to bustle about, fix up my land, and get in\r\nmy crops. I examined it more carefully, walked over it daily, and made\r\nmyself thoroughly acquainted with it. As before mentioned, it had been\r\nutterly neglected for a whole season, and was grown up with enormous\r\nweeds. These, after a day or two of drizzling rain, when the\r\nseed-vessels were so wet as not to allow their contents to shatter out,\r\nI mowed off, gathered into several large heaps, and burned--thus getting\r\nrid of millions of pestiferous seeds. Then I purchased ploughs,\r\nincluding a subsoiler, a harrow, cultivator, and other tools. One acre\r\nof the whole was in clover, another was set aside as being occupied by\r\nthe dwelling-house, garden, stable, and barnyard; but much the larger\r\nhalf of that acre was allowed for garden purposes. This left me just\r\nnine acres for general fruit and vegetable culture. I hired a man to\r\nplough them up, he finding his own team, and another to follow him in\r\nthe furrow with my subsoiler. The first went down ten inches, and the\r\nlatter ten more.\r\n\r\nMy neighbors were extremely kind with their suggestions. They had never\r\nseen such deep ploughing, and warned me not to turn up the old subsoil,\r\nand thus bring it to the surface. But they were not book-farmers.\r\n\r\nNow, this business of deep subsoil ploughing is a matter of\r\nindispensable value in all agriculture, but especially so in the\r\nplanting of an orchard. No tree can thrive as it ought to, unless the\r\nearth is thoroughly and deeply loosened for the free expansion of the\r\nroots. If I could have ploughed two feet deep, it would have been all\r\nthe better. In fact, the art of ploughing is in its mere infancy in this\r\ncountry. Too many of us follow blindly in the beaten track. The first\r\nplough was a tough, forked stick, of which one prong served as a beam,\r\nwhile the other dug the earth as a coulter. Of course the ploughing was\r\nonly scratching. It would have been preposterous to expect the ploughman\r\nof Hesiod’s or of Virgil’s time to turn up and mellow the soil to a\r\ndepth of fifteen or sixteen inches. Down to the present age, ploughing\r\nwas inevitably a shallow affair. But iron ploughs, steel ploughs,\r\nsubsoil ploughs, have changed all this. It is as easy to-day to mellow\r\nthe earth to the depth of two feet, as it was a century ago to turn over\r\na sward to the depth of six inches. Besides, our fierce, trying climate,\r\nso different from the moist, milder one of England, Ireland, or even\r\nHolland, whence our ancestors emigrated, absolutely requires of us deep\r\nploughing. Drought is our perpetual danger. Most crops are twenty to\r\nsixty per cent. short of what they would have been with adequate and\r\nseasonable moisture. That moisture exists not only in the skies above,\r\nbut in the earth beneath our plants. Though the skies may capriciously\r\nwithhold it, the earth never will, if we provide a rich, mellow subsoil\r\nthrough which the roots can descend for moisture.\r\n\r\nThe hotter and dryer the weather, the better our plants will grow, if\r\nthey have rich, warm earth beneath them, reaching down to and including\r\nmoisture. We cannot, and we need not plough so very deep each year to\r\nassure this, if the subsoil is so underdrained that the superabundant\r\nmoisture of the wet season does not pack it. Underdraining as the\r\nfoundation, and deep ploughing as the superstructure, with ample\r\nmanuring and generous tillage, will secure us ample crops, such as any\r\nsection of our country has rarely seen. Our corn should average seventy\r\nbushels per acre. Every field should be ready to grow wheat, if\r\nrequired. Every grass-lot should be good for three tons of hay per acre.\r\nAbundant fruits should gladden our fields and enrich our farmers’\r\ntables. So should our children no longer seek, in flight to crowded\r\ncities or the remote West, an escape from the ill-paid drudgery and\r\nintellectual barrenness of their fathers’ lives, but find abundance and\r\nhappiness in and around their childhood’s happy homes.\r\n\r\nI laid out two hundred dollars in the purchase of old, well-rotted\r\nstable manure from the city, spread it over the ten acres, and ploughed\r\nup nine of them. I then set out my peach-trees on six acres, planting\r\nthem in rows eighteen feet apart, and eighteen feet asunder in the rows.\r\nThis accommodated a hundred and thirty-four to the acre, or eight\r\nhundred and four in all. These would not be in the way of any other\r\ncrop, and in three years would be likely to yield a good return. The\r\nroots of every tree underwent a searching scrutiny before it was\r\nplanted, to see that they harbored no members of that worm family which\r\nis so surely destructive of the peach. As trees are often delivered from\r\nthe nursery with worms in them, so many of these were infected. The\r\nenemy was killed, and the butt of each tree was then swabbed with common\r\ntar, extending from where the roots begin to branch out, about twelve\r\ninches up. It is just about there, say between wind and water, at the\r\nsurface of the ground, where the bark is soft, that in June and\r\nSeptember the peach-moth deposits her eggs. From these is hatched the\r\nworm which kills the tree, unless picked out and destroyed.\r\n\r\nTo perform this searching operation on a thousand trees every year,\r\nwould be laborious and expensive. There would also be great danger of\r\nits being imperfectly done, as many worms might escape the search, while\r\nthe vital power of the tree would be seriously impaired by permitting\r\nthem to prey upon its bark and juices even for a few months. Prevention\r\nwould be far cheaper than curing. The offensive odor of the tar will\r\ncause the moth to shun the tree and to make her deposits somewhere else;\r\nwhile if any chance to light upon it, they will stick to the tar and\r\nthere perish, like flies upon a sheet of fly paper.\r\n\r\nThe tar was occasionally examined during the season, to see that it kept\r\nsoft and sticky; and where any hardening was discovered, a fresh\r\nswabbing was applied. The whole operation was really one of very little\r\ntrouble, while the result was highly remunerative. Thoughtfulness,\r\nindustry, and a little tar, did the business effectually. I believe no\r\nnostrum of putting ashes round the butt of a peach-tree to kill the\r\nworms, or any other nostrum of the kind is worth a copper. The only sure\r\nremedy is prevention. Do not let the worms get in, and there will be no\r\neffort needed to get them out.\r\n\r\nI planted none but the rarest and choicest kinds. Economy of a few cents\r\nin the price of a tree is no economy at all. It is the _best_ fruit that\r\nsells the quickest and pays the highest profit. Yet there are still\r\nlarge quantities of fruit produced which is not worth taking to market.\r\nThe best is cheaper for both buyer and seller. Hundreds of bushels of\r\napples and peaches are annually made into execrable pies in all the\r\nlarge cities, merely because they can be purchased at less cost than\r\nthose of a better quality. But it is a mistaken economy with the buyer,\r\nas a mild, good-flavored peach or apple requires less sugar, and will\r\nthen make a better pie. Many persons have a pride in, and attach too\r\nmuch consequence to a tree which sprung up spontaneously on their own\r\nfarm, or perhaps which they have cultivated with some care; and then\r\nnumbers of comparatively worthless seedlings occupy the places that\r\nshould be improved by finer varieties, and which, if cultivated, would\r\nafford a greater profit.\r\n\r\nIt is as easy to grow the choicest as the meanest fruit. I have a\r\nrelative in Ohio who has a peach orchard of eleven acres, which has\r\nyielded him five thousand dollars in a single season, during which\r\npeaches were selling in Cincinnati at twenty-five cents a bushel. It is\r\neasy to understand that his orchard would not have produced him that sum\r\nat that price. No, it did not. He received two dollars a bushel more\r\nreadily than his neighbors got twenty-five cents for the same variety of\r\npeaches, and this is how he did it. When the peaches had grown as large\r\nas a hickory nut, he employed a large force and put on one hundred and\r\neighty-five days’ work in picking off the excess of fruit. More than\r\none-half of the fruit then upon the trees was carefully removed. Each\r\nlimb was taken by hand, and where, within a space of eighteen inches,\r\nthere would be probably twenty peaches, but six or seven of the fairest\r\nwould be left to ripen. Thus, by carefully removing all but the\r\nstrongest specimens, and throwing all the vigor of the tree into them,\r\nthe peaches ripen early, and are remarkable for size and excellence of\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nBut this was labor! Seven months’ labor of one man in a small peach\r\norchard! But be it so--the net profit was between three and four\r\nthousand dollars. If he had neglected his trees, the owner’s profits\r\nwould have been a crop of peaches hardly fit to feed the pigs. I have\r\nprofited largely by following his example, and will relate my own\r\nexperience when the returns of my orchard come in.\r\n\r\nI intend to be particular touching my peach orchard, as well for the\r\ngratification of my own pride, as an incentive to those who cannot be\r\nmade to believe Ten Acres Enough. My success with it has far outstripped\r\nmy expectations; and I pronounce a peach orchard of this size, planted\r\nand cultivated as it can be, and will be, by an intelligent man not\r\nessentially lazy, as the sheet anchor of his safety. I was careful to\r\nplant none but small trees, because such can be removed from the nursery\r\nwith greater safety than large ones, while the roots are less\r\nmultiplied, and thus receive fewer injuries; neither are they liable to\r\nbe displaced by high winds before acquiring a firm foothold in the\r\nground. Many persons suppose that newly planted trees should be large\r\nenough to be out of danger from cattle running among them; but all\r\ncattle should be excluded from a young orchard.\r\n\r\nMoreover, small trees make a better growth, and are more easily trimmed\r\ninto proper shape. All experienced horticulturists testify to the\r\nsuperior eligibility of small trees. They cost less at the nursery, less\r\nin transportation, and very few fail to grow. One year old from the bud\r\nis old enough, and the same, generally, may be said of apples and pears.\r\nI dug holes for each tree three feet square and two feet deep, and\r\nfilled in with a mixture of the surrounding top-soil and leached ashes,\r\na half bushel of the latter to each tree. Knowing that the peach-tree\r\ndelights in ashes, I obtained four hundred bushels from a city\r\nsoap-works, and am satisfied they were exactly the manure my orchard\r\nneeded. Every root which had been wounded by the spade in removing the\r\ntree from the nursery, was cut off just back of the wound, paring it\r\nsmooth with a sharp knife. The fine earth was settled around the roots\r\nby pouring in water; after which the mixture of earth and ashes was\r\nthrown on until the hole was filled, leaving a slight depression round\r\nthe tree, to catch the rain, and the tree at about the same level it had\r\nmaintained when standing in the nursery.\r\n\r\nI did not stake up the trees. They were too small to need it; besides, I\r\nshould be all the time on hand to keep them in position. Being a\r\nnew-comer, I had no straw with which to mulch them, to retain the proper\r\nmoisture about the roots, or it would have been applied. But the season\r\nturned out to be abundantly showery, and they went on growing from the\r\nstart. Not a tree was upset by storm or wind, nor did one of them die. I\r\ndo not think the oldest nurseryman in the country could have been more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis operation made a heavy draft on the small cash capital which I\r\npossessed. But small as it was, it was large enough to show that capital\r\nis indispensable to successful farming. Had I been without it, my\r\norchard would have been a mere hope, instead of a reality, and I might\r\nhave been compelled to wait for years before feeling rich enough to\r\nestablish it. But when the work of planting was over, my satisfaction\r\nwas extreme; and when I saw the trees in full leaf, giving token that\r\nthe work had been well done, I felt that I had not only learned but\r\naccomplished much. I had been constantly on the ground while the\r\nplanting was progressing--had seen for myself that every tree was\r\ncleared of worms--had held them up while the water and the earth and\r\nashes had been thrown in and gently packed about the roots--and had\r\ngiven so much attention in other ways, as to feel sure that no part of\r\nthe whole operation had been neglected; and hence I had a clear right to\r\nregard it as my own job.\r\n\r\nThe cost of planting this orchard was as follows:\r\n\r\n  804 trees at 7 cents         $56.28\r\n  Planting them 2 cents         16.08\r\n  Ploughing and harrowing       20.00\r\n  400 bushels of ashes          48.00\r\n  Manure                       200.00\r\n                               ------\r\n                               340.36\r\n\r\nI have unfairly saddled on the orchard the whole charge of two hundred\r\ndollars for manure, because it went to nourish other crops which the\r\nsame ground produced. But let that go--the land was quite poor, needed\r\nall it got, and I had no faith in farming without manure. Had my purse\r\nbeen heavy enough, the quantity should have been trebled.\r\n\r\nAs I am writing for the benefit of others, who, I hope, are not yet\r\ntired of peaches, let me add that this fruit will not succeed on ground\r\nwhere a previous orchard has been recently grown; neither can one be\r\nsure of getting healthy trees from any nurseryman who grows his on land\r\nfrom which he had recently produced a similar crop. The seed must be\r\nfrom healthy trees, and the buds from others equally free from disease.\r\nThe peach, unless carefully watched and attended, is a short-lived tree.\r\nBut it returns a generous income to a careful and generous grower. Of\r\nlatter years the worm is its most formidable enemy. But with those who\r\nthink a good tree is as much worth being taken care of as a good horse,\r\nthere will be neither doubt nor difficulty in keeping the destroyer out.\r\n\r\nTen well-grown, bearing trees, which I found in the garden, were\r\nharboring a hundred and ninety worms among them when I undertook the\r\nwork of extermination. I bared the collar and roots of each tree as far\r\nas I could track a worm, and cut him out. I then scrubbed the whole\r\nexposed part with soap-suds and a regular scrubbing-brush; after which I\r\nlet them remain exposed for a week. If any worms had been overlooked,\r\nthe chips thrown out by their operations would be plainly visible on the\r\nclean surface at the week’s end. Having tracked and cut out them also, I\r\nfelt sure the enemy was exterminated, and covered up the roots, but\r\nfirst using the swab of common tar, applying it all round the collar,\r\nand some distance up.\r\n\r\nThese garden-trees were terribly scarified by the worms. But the\r\ncleaning out I gave them was effectual. The soap-suds purged the injured\r\nparts of the unhealthy virus deposited by the worms, leaving them so\r\nnice and clean that the new bark began immediately to close over the\r\ncavities, and soon covered them entirely. I thus saved ten valuable\r\nbearing trees. Then I shortened in the long, straggling branches, for\r\nthe peach will certainly grow sprawling out on every side, forming long\r\nbranches which break down under the weight of a full crop at their\r\nextremities, unless the pruning-knife is freely used every season. All\r\nthis was the work of less than a day, and shows that if peach-orchards\r\nperish after bearing only two or three crops, it may be attributed\r\nsolely to mere neglect and laziness on the part of their owners. They\r\nplant trees, refuse to take care of them, and then complain if they die\r\nearly. The world would soon be without pork, if all the pigs were as\r\nmuch neglected. These ten trees have never failed to produce me generous\r\ncrops of luscious fruit. I cannot think of any investment which has paid\r\nme better than the slight labor annually required to keep them in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI have tried with entire success two other methods of protecting\r\npeach-trees from the ravages of the worm. I have found gas-tar equally\r\neffectual with the common tar, and much more easily obtained. But care\r\nmust be taken not to cover a height of more than four to six inches of\r\nthe butt of the tree. If the whole stem from root to branch be covered,\r\nthe tree will surely die. Another method is to inclose the butt in a\r\njacket of pasteboard, or even thick hardware paper, keeping it in place\r\nwith a string, and lowering it an inch or two below the ground, so as to\r\nprevent the fly having access to the soft part of the bark. These\r\njackets will last two or three years, as they should be taken off at the\r\napproach of winter, to prevent them from becoming a harbor for insects.\r\nBut they are an infallible preventive. I have recently procured a supply\r\nof the thick tarred felt which is used for making paper roofs, to be cut\r\nup and turned into jackets. This material will last for years, being\r\nwater-proof, while the odor of the gas-tar in which it has been steeped\r\nis peculiarly offensive to the whole tribe of insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPLANTING RASPBERRIES AND STRAWBERRIES--TRICKS OF THE NURSERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy peach-orchard was no sooner finished than I filled each row with\r\nraspberries, setting the roots two feet apart in the rows. This enabled\r\nme to get seven roots in between every two trees, or five thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty-six in all. This was equivalent to nearly two acres\r\nwholly planted with raspberries according to the usual plan. They would\r\ngo on growing without injuring the peach-trees, or being injured by\r\nthem; and when the latter should reach their full growth, their shade\r\nwould be highly beneficial to the raspberries, as they thrive better and\r\nbear more freely when half protected from the burning sun. The tops were\r\ncut off within a few inches of the ground, thus preventing any excessive\r\ndraft upon the newly planted roots. No staking up was needed. These\r\nroots cost me six dollars per thousand, or thirty-four dollars for the\r\nlot, and were the ordinary Red Antwerp. The season proving showery, they\r\ngrew finely. Some few died, but my general luck was very satisfactory. I\r\nplanted the whole lot in three days with my own hands.\r\n\r\nI am sure the growth of my raspberries was owing, in a great degree, to\r\nthe deep ploughing the land had received. The soil they delight in is\r\none combining richness, depth, and moisture. It is only from such that\r\na full crop may be expected every season. The roots must have abundance\r\nof elbow-room to run down and suck up moisture from the abundant\r\nreservoir which exists below. Deep ploughing will save them from the\r\neffects of dry weather, which otherwise will blast the grower’s hopes,\r\ngiving him a small berry, shrivelled up from want of moisture, instead\r\nof one of ample size, rich, and juicy. Hence irrigation has been known\r\nto double the size of raspberries, as well as doubling the growth of the\r\ncanes in a single season. Mulching also is a capital thing. One row so\r\ntreated, by way of experiment, showed a marked improvement over all the\r\nothers, besides keeping down the weeds.\r\n\r\nAs a market fruit the raspberry stands on the same list with the best,\r\nand I am satisfied that one cannot produce too much. For this purpose I\r\nconsider the Red Antwerp most admirably adapted. There are twenty other\r\nvarieties, some of which are probably quite as valuable, but I was\r\nunwilling to have my attention divided among many sorts. One really good\r\nberry was enough for me. Some of my neighbors have as much as ten acres\r\nin this fruit, from which they realize prodigious profits. Like all the\r\nsmaller fruits, it yields a quick return to an industrious and\r\npains-taking cultivator.\r\n\r\nImmediately on getting my raspberries in, I went twice over the six\r\nacres with the cultivator, stirring up the ground some four inches deep,\r\nas it had been a good deal trampled down by our planting operations.\r\nThis I did myself, with a thirty-dollar horse which I had recently\r\nbought. Having eighteen feet between two rows of peach-trees, I divided\r\nthis space into five rows for strawberries, giving me very nearly three\r\nfeet between each row. In these rows I set the strawberry plants, one\r\nfoot apart, making about 10,000 plants per acre, allowing for the\r\nheadlands. I bought the whole 60,000 required for $2 per thousand,\r\nmaking $120. This was below the market price.\r\n\r\nIn planting these I got three of the children to help me, and though it\r\nwas more tiresome work than they had ever been accustomed to, yet they\r\nstood bravely up to it. Every noon we four went home with raging\r\nappetites for dinner, where the plain but well-cooked fare provided by\r\nmy wife and eldest daughter--for she kept no servant--was devoured with\r\ngenuine country relish. The exercise in the open air for the whole week\r\nwhich it took us to get through this job did us all a vast amount of\r\ngood. Roses came into the cheeks of my daughters, to which the cheeks\r\naforesaid had been strangers in the city; and it was the general remark\r\namong us at breakfast, that it had never felt so good to get to bed the\r\nnight before. Thus honest labor brought wholesome appetites and sound\r\nrepose. Most of us complained of joints a little stiffened by so much\r\nstooping, but an hour’s exercise at more stooping made us limber for the\r\nremainder of the day.\r\n\r\nIt occupied us a whole week to set out these plants, for we were all new\r\nhands at the business. But the work was carefully done, and a shower\r\ncoming on just as we had finished, it settled the earth nicely to the\r\nroots, and I do not think more than two hundred of them died. I intended\r\nto put a pinch of guano compost or a handful of poudrette into each\r\nhill, but thought I could not afford it, and so let them go, trusting to\r\nbeing able to give them a dressing of some kind of manure the following\r\nspring. I much regretted this omission, as I was fully aware of the\r\ngreat value of the best strawberries, and plenty of them. My wife\r\nthought at first that six acres was an enormous quantity to\r\nhave--inquired if I expected to feed the family on strawberries, and\r\nwhether it was not worth while to set about raising some sugar to go\r\nwith them, feeling certain that a great deal of _that_ would be wanted.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that I had planted Wilson’s Albany Seedling. This was\r\nthe berry for which we had been compelled to pay such high prices while\r\nliving in the city. Everybody testified to its being the most profuse\r\nbearer, while its great size and handsome shape made it eagerly sought\r\nafter in the market. It was admitted, all things considered, to be the\r\nbest market berry then known. My experience has confirmed this. True, it\r\nis a little tarter than most other varieties, and therefore requires\r\nmore sugar to make it palatable; but this objection is more theoretical\r\nthan practical, as I always noticed that when the berries came upon the\r\ntable, while living in the city, we continued to pile on the sugar, no\r\nmatter what the price or quantity. The berries were there, and must be\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, on repeating this observation to my wife, she admitted\r\nhaving noticed the same remarkable fact, and added that she believed\r\nstrawberries would continue to be eaten, even if each quart required a\r\npound of sugar to sweeten it. She declared that for her part, she and\r\nthe children intended to do so in future.\r\n\r\nNow, although she was extravagantly fond of strawberries, and had\r\nbrought up our children in the same faith, this threat did not alarm me,\r\nfor I knew that hereafter our berries would cost me nothing, and that if\r\nthey devoured them too freely, sugar included, a slight pain under the\r\napron of some of them would be likely to moderate their infatuation. I\r\nthen suggested to her, how would it do--whether it would not make our\r\nestablishment immensely popular--if in selling my berries, when the crop\r\ncame in next year, to announce to the public that we would throw the\r\nsugar in? She looked at me a moment, and must have suspected that I was\r\nquizzing her; for she got up and left the room, saying she must go into\r\nthe kitchen, as she heard the tea-kettle boiling over. But though I\r\nwaited a full half hour, yet she did not return.\r\n\r\nThe reader may have been all this time watching the condition of my\r\npurse. But he has not been so observant as myself. These plants did not\r\ncost me cash. I had intended to plant an acre or two to begin with. But\r\nafter buying my peach-trees and raspberries, the nurseryman inquired if\r\nI did not intend to plant strawberries also, as he had a very large\r\nquantity which he would sell cheap. His saying that he had a very large\r\nlot, and that he would sell them cheap, seemed to imply that he found a\r\ndifficulty in disposing of them. Besides, the selling season was pretty\r\nnearly over. I therefore fought shy, and merely inquired his terms. This\r\nled to a long colloquy between us, in the course of which I held off\r\njust in proportion as he became urgent. At last, believing that I was\r\nnot disposed to buy, although I went there for that very purpose, he\r\noffered to sell me 60,000 plants for $120, and to take his money out of\r\nthe proceeds of my first crop. This offer I considered fair enough, much\r\nbetter than I expected; and after having distinctly agreed that he\r\nshould depend upon the crop, and not on me, for payment, and that if the\r\ncoming season yielded nothing he should wait for the following one, I\r\nconfessed to him that his persuasions had overcome me, and consented to\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I did not run in debt--I saved just that much of my\r\ncapital, and could make a magnificent beginning with our favorite fruit.\r\nAs I was leaving this liberal man, he observed to me:\r\n\r\n“Well, I am glad you have taken this lot, as I was intending to plough\r\nthem in to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?” I inquired, not exactly understanding his meaning.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said he, “I have so many now that I must have the ground for other\r\npurposes, and so meant to plough them under if you had not bought them.”\r\n\r\nThis was an entirely new wrinkle to me, and fully explained why he could\r\nafford to farm them out on the conditions referred to. Though a capital\r\nbargain for me, yet it was a still better one for him. What he was to\r\nreceive was absolutely so much clear gain. But then, after all that has\r\nbeen said and written, is it not a truth that cannot be disputed, that\r\nno bargain can be pronounced a good one unless all the parties to it are\r\nin some way benefited?\r\n\r\nHere, now, were six acres of ground pretty well crowded up, at least on\r\npaper. But the strawberries would never grow higher than six inches; the\r\nraspberries would be kept down to three or four feet, while the peaches\r\nwould overtop all. Each would be certain to keep out of the other’s way.\r\nThen look at the succession. The strawberries would be in market first,\r\nthe raspberries would follow, and then the peaches, for of the latter I\r\nhad planted the earliest sorts; so that, unlike a farm devoted wholly to\r\nthe raising of grain, which comes into market only once a year, I should\r\nhave one cash-producing crop succeeding to another during most of the\r\nsummer. On the remaining three acres I meant to raise something which\r\nwould bring money in the autumn, so as to keep me flush all the time.\r\nYou may say that this was reckoning my chickens before they were\r\nhatched; but you will please remember that thus far I have not even\r\nmentioned chickens, and I pray that you will be equally considerate. I\r\nknow, at least I have some indistinct recollection of having heard that\r\nthe proof of the pudding lay in the eating. But pray be patient, even\r\ncredulous, until the aforesaid mythical pudding is served up. I am now\r\ncooking it, and you ought all to know that cooks must not be hurried. In\r\ngood time it will come smoking on the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRIES--A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of my agricultural reading for some years previous to\r\ncoming into the country, I had noticed great things said of a new\r\nblackberry which had been discovered in the State of New York. The\r\nstories printed in relation to it were almost fabulous. It was\r\nrepresented as growing twenty feet high, and as bearing berries nearly\r\nas large as a walnut, which melted on the tongue with a lusciousness to\r\nwhich the softest ice-cream was a mere circumstance, while the fruit was\r\nsaid to be strung upon its branches like onions on a rope. A single bush\r\nwould supply a large family with fruit! I was amazed at the extravagant\r\naccounts given of its unexampled productiveness and matchless flavor. I\r\nhad supposed that I knew all about blackberries, but here was a great\r\nmarvel in a department which had been proverbially free from\r\neccentricities of that kind.\r\n\r\nBut I followed it--in the papers--for a long time. At last I saw it\r\nstated that the rare plant could not be propagated from the seed, but\r\nonly from suckers, and therefore very slowly. Of course it could not be\r\nafforded for less than a dollar apiece! It would be unreasonable to look\r\nfor blackberries for less! It struck me that the superior flavor claimed\r\nfor it must be a little of the silvery order--that in berries bought at\r\nthat price, a touch might be detected even of the most auriferous\r\nfragrance. Still, I was an amateur--in a small way. I rejoiced in a city\r\ngarden which would readily accommodate a hundred of this extraordinary\r\nberry, especially as it was said to do better and bear more fruit, when\r\ncut down to four feet, instead of being allowed to grow to a height of\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nIt thus seemed to be made for such miniature gardeners as myself. One\r\ngenerous advertiser offered to send six roots by mail for five dollars,\r\nprovided ten red stamps were inclosed with the money. I had never before\r\nheard of blackberries being sent by mail; but the whole thing was\r\nrecommended by men in whose standing all confidence could be placed, and\r\nwho, as far as could be discovered, had no plants to sell. Under such\r\ncircumstances, doubt seemed to be absurd.\r\n\r\nI sent five dollars and the stamps. But this was one of the secrets I\r\nnever told my wife until she had eaten the first bowlful of the fully\r\nripened fruit, eighteen months afterwards. Well, the plants came in a\r\nletter--mere fibres of a greater root--certainly not thicker than a thin\r\nquill, not one of them having a top. They looked like long white worms,\r\nwith here and there a bud or eye. I never saw, until then, what I\r\nconsidered the meanest five dollars’ worth of any thing I had ever\r\nbought; and when my wife inquired what those things were I was planting,\r\nI replied that they were little vegetable wonders which a distant\r\ncorrespondent had sent me. Not dreaming that they cost me near a dollar\r\napiece, at the very time I owed a quarter’s rent, she dropped the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut I planted them in a deeply spaded and rich sunny border, deluged\r\nthem every week with suds from the family wash, and by the close of the\r\nseason they had sent up more than a dozen strong canes which stood six\r\nfeet high. The next summer they bore a crop of fruit which astonished\r\nme. From the group of bushes I picked fifteen quarts of berries superior\r\nto any thing of the kind we had ever eaten. I then confided the secret\r\nto my wife: she considered the plants cheap at five dollars, and\r\npronounced my venture a good one. I think we had more than five dollars’\r\nworth of satisfaction in showing them to our friends and neighbors. We\r\ngave away some pints of the fruit, and such was its fame and popularity,\r\nthat I feel convinced we could have readily disposed of it all in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nOne of the reporters for a penny-paper hearing of the matter, called in\r\nmy absence to see them. My wife politely acted as showman, and being\r\nvery eloquent of speech on any matter which happens to strike her fancy,\r\nshe was quite as communicative as he desired. She did not know that the\r\nfellow was a penny-a-liner, whose vocation it was to magnify an ant-hill\r\ninto a mountain. To her extreme consternation, as well as to mine, the\r\nnext morning’s paper contained a half-column article describing my\r\nblackberries, even giving my name and the number of the house. By ten\r\no’clock that day the latter was run down with strangers, who had thus\r\nbeen publicly invited to call and see the new blackberry. Our opposite\r\nneighbors laughed heartily over my wife’s vexation, and for the first\r\ntime in my life I saw her almost immovable good temper give way. The\r\nnuisance continued for weeks, as the vile article had been copied into\r\nsome of the neighboring country papers, and thus new swarms of bores\r\nwere inflamed with curiosity. This little vexatious circumstance\r\nafforded unmistakable evidence of the great interest taken by the public\r\nin the discovery of a new and valuable fruit. I could have disposed of\r\nthousands of plants if I had had them for sale.\r\n\r\nThis was the New Rochelle or Lawton Blackberry. The numerous suckers\r\nwhich came up around each root I transplanted along my border, until I\r\nhad more than two hundred of them. This was long before a single berry\r\nhad been offered for sale in the Philadelphia market, though the papers\r\ntold me that the fruit was selling in New York at half a dollar per\r\nquart, and that the great consuming public of that city, having once\r\ntasted of it, was clamorous for more. I am constrained to say that the\r\nnurserymen who had these plants to sell did not over praise them. This\r\nberry has fully realized all they promised in relation to it; and a debt\r\nof thankfulness is owing to the men who first discovered and caused it\r\nto be propagated. It has taken its place in public estimation beside the\r\nstrawberry and raspberry, and will henceforth continue to be a favorite\r\nin every market where it may become known.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary fruit was first noticed in 1834, by Mr. Lewis A.\r\nSecor, of New Rochelle, New York, who observed a single bush growing\r\nwild in an open field, but loaded with astonishing clusters of larger\r\nberries than he had ever seen, and of superior richness of flavor. At\r\nthe proper season he removed the plant to his garden, where he continued\r\nto propagate it for several years, during which time it won the\r\nunqualified admiration of all who had an opportunity of either seeing or\r\ntasting the fruit. Numerous plants were distributed, and its propagation\r\nin private gardens and nurseries began. A quantity of the fruit being\r\nexhibited at the Farmers’ Club, by Mr. William Lawton, the club named it\r\nafter him, leaving the discoverer unrecognized.\r\n\r\nGreat sums of money have been made by propagators of this berry. It\r\npossesses peculiar merits in the estimation of market gardeners. It\r\nripens just as the supply of strawberries and raspberries has been\r\nexhausted, and before peaches and grapes have made their appearance,\r\nfilling with delicious fruit a horticultural vacuum which had long\r\nexisted. Its mammoth size and luscious qualities insure for it the\r\nhighest prices, and it has steadily maintained its original character.\r\nIt pays the grower enormously, is a sure bearer, is never touched by\r\nfrost or attacked by insect enemies, and when well manured and staked up\r\nfrom the wind, and cut down to four feet high, with the limbs shortened\r\nto a foot, will readily produce two thousand quarts to the acre. Some\r\ngrowers have greatly exceeded this quantity. I have known a single plant\r\nto yield eighteen hundred berries, and three plants to produce sixteen\r\nquarts. Its flavor is entirely different from that of the common wild\r\nblackberry, while it abounds in juice, and contains no core. It is\r\nevidently a distinct variety. It has also long been famous for yielding\r\na most superior wine.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into the country I had two hundred of the Lawton blackberry\r\nto plant, all which were the product of my five-dollar venture. In\r\ndigging them up from my city garden, every inch of root that could be\r\nfound was carefully hunted out. They had multiplied under ground to a\r\nsurprising extent--some of them being as much as twenty feet in length.\r\nThese roots were full of buds from which new canes would spring. Their\r\nvitality is almost unconquerable--everybody knows a blackberry is the\r\nhardest thing in the world to kill. I cut off the canes six inches above\r\nthe root, then divided each stool into separate roots, and then cutting\r\nup the long roots into slips containing one to two eyes each, I found my\r\nnumber of sets to exceed a thousand, quite enough to plant an acre.\r\n\r\nThese I put out in rows eight feet apart, and eight feet asunder in the\r\nrows. Not ten of them died, as they came fresh out of the ground in one\r\nplace, only to be immediately covered up some three inches deep in\r\nanother. Thus this whole five-dollar speculation was one of the luckiest\r\nhits I ever made; because I began early, before the plant had passed\r\ninto everybody’s hands; and when it came into general demand, I was the\r\nonly grower near the city who had more than a dozen plants. Very soon\r\neverybody wanted the fruit, and the whole neighborhood wanted the\r\nplants. How I condescended to supply both classes of customers will\r\nappear hereafter.\r\n\r\nYet, while setting out these roots, several of my neighbors, as usual\r\nwhen I was doing any thing, came to oversee me. On former occasions they\r\nhad expressed considerable incredulity as to my operations; and it was\r\neasy to see from their remarks and inquiries now, that they thought I\r\ndidn’t know much, and would have nothing for my labor but my pains. I\r\nalways listened good-humoredly to their remarks, because I discovered\r\nthat now and then they let fall something which was of real value to me.\r\nWhen they discovered it was blackberries I was planting, some of them\r\nlaughed outright. But I replied that this Lawton berry was a new\r\nvariety, superior to any thing known, and an incredible bearer. They\r\nanswered me they could find better ones in any fence corner in the\r\ntownship, and that if I once got them into my ground I could never get\r\nthem out. It struck me the last remark would also apply as justly to my\r\npeach-trees.\r\n\r\nBut I contented myself with saying that I should never want to get them\r\nout, and that the time would come when they would all want the same\r\nthing in their own ground. Thus it is that pioneers in any thing are\r\ngenerally ridiculed and discouraged by the general multitude. Of all my\r\nvisitors, only two appeared to have any correct knowledge of the new\r\nplant. They offered to buy part of my stock; but on refusing to sell,\r\nthey engaged to take some in the autumn.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in writing of the Lawton, because of my\r\nsingular success with it from the start. I thus occupied my seventh\r\nacre; but the rows being eight feet apart, abundant room was left to\r\nraise a crop of some kind between them. Even in the rows, between the\r\nroots, I planted corn, which grew well, and afforded a most beneficial\r\nshade to the young blackberries as they grew up. I am satisfied they\r\nflourished, better for being thus protected the first season from the\r\nhot sun. When in full maturity, they need all the sun they can get. They\r\nwill grow and flourish in almost any soil in which they once become well\r\nrooted, though they are rank feeders on manure. Like a young pig, feed\r\nthem well and they will grow to an astonishing size: starve them, and\r\nyour crops will be mere runts. It is from the same skinning practice\r\nthat so many corn-cribs are seen to abound in nubbins.\r\n\r\nI had thus two acres left unoccupied; one acre, as previously stated,\r\nwas most fortunately in clover. On this I put four bushels of ground\r\nplaster mixed with a sprinkling of guano, the two costing me only five\r\ndollars. I afterwards devoted an acre to tomatoes, and the last to\r\nparsnips, cabbages, turnips, and sweet corn. This latter was scattered\r\nin rows or drills three feet apart, intending it for green fodder for\r\nthe horse and cow when the clover gave out. The turnips were sowed\r\nbetween the corn-rows, and were intended for winter feeding for horse\r\nand cow. On the acre of blackberries, between the rows, I planted\r\ncabbage, putting into each hill a spoonful of mixed plaster and guano,\r\nand wherever I could find vacant spots about the place, there also a\r\ncabbage plant was set out. A few pumpkin hills were started in suitable\r\nplaces. In fact, my effort was to occupy every inch of ground with\r\nsomething. The cabbage and tomato plants cost me thirty dollars.\r\n\r\nThese several crops were put in as the season for each one came round.\r\nThe green-corn crop was not all put in at one time, but at intervals\r\nabout two weeks apart, so that I should have a succession of succulent\r\nfood during the summer. The horse and cow were to be kept in the\r\nbarnyard, as I had no faith in turning cattle out to pasture, thus\r\nrequiring three times as much land as was necessary, besides losing half\r\nthe manure. The latter was a sort of hobby with me. I was determined to\r\ngive my crops all they could profitably appropriate, and so soil my\r\nlittle stock; that is, keep them in the barnyard in summer, and in the\r\nstable in winter, while their food was to be brought to them, instead of\r\ntheir being forced to go after it. I knew it would cost time and\r\ntrouble; but I have long since discovered that most things of value in\r\nthis world come to us only as the result of diligent, unremitted labor.\r\nThe man, even upon ten acres, who is content to see around him only\r\nbarren fields, scanty crops, and lean, starving animals, does not\r\ndeserve the name of farmer. Unless he can devise ways and means for\r\nchanging such a condition of things, and cease ridiculing all\r\npropositions of amendment that may be pointed out to him, he had better\r\nbe up and off, and give place to a live man. Such skinning and\r\nexhausting tillage is one cause of the annual relative decline of the\r\nwheat-crop all over the Union, and of the frequent changes in the\r\nownership of lands. The fragrance of a fat and ample manure heap is as\r\ngrateful to the nostrils of a good farmer, as the fumes of the tavern\r\nare notoriously attractive to those of a poor one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE GARDEN--FEMALE MANAGEMENT--COMFORTS AND PROFITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI mentioned some time ago that the wife of the former owner of this\r\nplace had left it with a world of regrets. She had been passionately\r\nfond of the garden which now fell to us. As daylight can be seen through\r\nvery small holes, so little things will illustrate a person’s character.\r\nIndeed, character consists in little acts, and honorably performed;\r\ndaily life being the quarry from which we build it up and rough-hew the\r\nhabits that form it. The garden she had prepared, and cultivated for\r\nseveral years, doing much of the work of planting, watching, watering,\r\nand training with her own hands, bore honorable testimony to the\r\ngoodness of hers. She had filled it with the choicest fruit-trees, most\r\nof which were now in full bearing. There was abundance of all the usual\r\ngarden fruits, currants, gooseberries, grapes, and an ample asparagus\r\nbed. It was laid out with taste, convenience, and liberality. Flowers,\r\nof course, had not been omitted by such a woman. Her vocation had\r\nevidently been something beyond that of merely cooking her husband’s\r\ndinners. But her garden bore marks of long abandonment. Great weeds were\r\nrioting in the borders, grass had taken foothold in the alleys, and it\r\nstood in need of a new mistress to work up into profitable use the\r\nstore of riches it contained. It struck me that if one woman could\r\nestablish a garden like this, I could find another on my own premises to\r\nmanage it.\r\n\r\nAfter I had got through with the various plantings of my standard\r\nfruits--indeed, while much of it was going on--I took resolute hold of\r\nthe garden. It was large enough to provide vegetables for three\r\nfamilies. I meant to make it sure for one. With all the lights and\r\nimprovements of modern times, and they are many, three-fourths of the\r\nfarm gardens in our country are still a disgrace to our husbandry. As a\r\nrule, the most easily raised vegetables are not to be found in them; and\r\nthe small fruits, with the exception of currants and gooseberries, are\r\nuniversally neglected. Many of our farmers have never tasted an early\r\nYork cabbage. If they get cabbages or potatoes by August, they think\r\nthey are doing pretty well. They do not understand the simple mysteries\r\nof a hotbed, and so force nothing. Now, with this article, which need\r\nnot cost five dollars, and which a boy of ten years can manage, you can\r\nhave cabbages and potatoes in June, and beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, and\r\nsquashes, and a host of other delicious vegetables, a little later.\r\n\r\nBy selecting your seed, you can have salad, green peas, onions, and\r\nbeets by the last of June, or before without any forcing. A good\r\nasparagus bed, covering two square rods of ground, is a luxury that no\r\nfarmer should be without. It will give him a palatable dish, green and\r\nsucculent from the bosom of the earth every day, from May to July. A\r\ngood variety of vegetables is within the reach of every farmer the year\r\nround. They are not only an important means of supporting the family,\r\npaying at least one-half the table expenses, but they are greatly\r\nconducive to health. They relieve the terrible monotony of salt junk,\r\nand in the warm season prevent the fevers and bowel complaints so often\r\ninduced by too much animal food.\r\n\r\nNeglect is thus too much the rule. A row of currants, for example, is\r\nplanted in a garden. It will indeed bear well with neglect; but an\r\nannual manuring and thinning out of old wood, would at least triple the\r\nsize of the fruit, and improve its quality. The row of currants will\r\nfurnish a daily supply of refreshing fruit to the table for months\r\ntogether. Why should its culture then be totally neglected, when a row\r\nof corn by its side of equal length, which will supply only a single\r\nfeeding to a pen of hogs, is most carefully manured, watched, ploughed,\r\nand hoed? I have sometimes seen farmers who, after expending large sums\r\nin establishing a young orchard of trees, would destroy one-half by\r\nchoking them with a crop of oats or clover, because they could not\r\nafford to lose the use of the small strip of land a few feet wide in the\r\nrow, which ought to have been kept clean and cultivated.\r\n\r\nI began by deepening the garden soil wherever a spade could be put in. I\r\nhired a man for this purpose, and paid him ten dollars for the job,\r\nincluding the hauling and digging in of the great pile of manure I had\r\nfound in the barnyard, and the clearing up of things generally. I would\r\nhave laid out fifty dollars in manure, if the money could have been\r\nspared; but what I did afforded an excellent return. My wife and eldest\r\ndaughter, Kate, then in her eighteenth year, did all the planting. I\r\nspent five dollars in buying for them a complete outfit of hoes, rakes,\r\nand trowels for garden use, lightly made on purpose for female handling,\r\nwith a neat little wheelbarrow to hold the weeds and litter which I felt\r\npretty sure would have to be hoed up and trundled away before the season\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThey took to the garden manfully. I kept their hoes constantly sharpened\r\nwith a file, and they declared it was only pastime to wage warfare on\r\nthe weeds with weapons so keen. Now and then one of the boys went in to\r\ngive them a lift; and when a new vegetable bed was to be planted, it was\r\ndug up and made ready for them. But the great bulk of all other work was\r\ndone by themselves.\r\n\r\nNever has either of them enjoyed health so robust, or appetites so\r\nwholesome. As a whole year’s crop of weeds had gone to seed, they had\r\nmillions of the enemy to contend with, just as I had anticipated. I did\r\nnot volunteer discouragements by repeating to them the old English\r\nformula, that\r\n\r\n    “One year’s seeding\r\n     Makes seven years’ weeding,”\r\n\r\nbut commended their industry, exhorted them to persevere, and was lavish\r\nin my admiration of the handsome style in which they kept the grounds. I\r\ninfused into their minds a perfect hatred of the whole tribe of weeds,\r\nenjoined it upon them not to let a single one escape and go to seed,\r\nand promised them that if they thus exterminated all, the next year’s\r\nweeding would be mere recreation.\r\n\r\nI will say for them, that all our visitors from the city were surprised\r\nat seeing the garden so free from weeds, while they did not fail to\r\nnotice that most of the vegetables were extremely thrifty. They did not\r\nknow that in gardens where the weeds thrive undisturbed, the vegetables\r\nnever do. As to the neighbors, they came in occasionally to see what the\r\nwomen were doing, but shook their heads when they saw they were merely\r\nhoeing up weeds--said that weeds did no harm, and they might as well\r\nattempt to kill all the flies--they had been brought up among weeds,\r\nknew all about them, and “it was no use trying to get rid of them.”\r\n\r\nBut the work of weeding kept on through the whole season, and as a\r\nconsequence, the ground about the vegetables was kept constantly\r\nstirred. The result of this thorough culture was, that nearly every\r\nthing seemed to feel it, and the growth was prodigious, far exceeding\r\nwhat the family could consume. We had every thing we needed, and in far\r\ngreater abundance than we ever had in the city. I am satisfied this\r\nprofusion of vegetables lessened the consumption of meat in the family\r\none-half. Indeed, it was such, that my wife suggested that the garden\r\nhad so much more in it than we required, that perhaps it would be as\r\nwell to send the surplus to the store where we usually bought our\r\ngroceries, to be there sold for our benefit.\r\n\r\nThe town within half a mile of us contained some five thousand\r\ninhabitants, among whom there was a daily demand for vegetables. I took\r\nmy wife’s advice, and from time to time gathered such as she directed,\r\nfor she and Kate were sole mistresses of the garden, and sent them to\r\nthe store. They kept a regular book-account of these consignments, and\r\nwhen we came to settle up with the storekeeper at the year’s end, were\r\nsurprised to find that he had eighty dollars to our credit. But this was\r\nnot all from vegetables--a good deal of it came from the fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nAfter using in the family great quantities of fine peaches from the ten\r\ngarden-trees, certainly three times as many as we could ever afford to\r\nbuy when in the city, the rest went to the store. The trees had been so\r\nhackled by the worms that they did not bear full crops, yet the yield\r\nwas considerable. Then there were quantities of spare currants,\r\ngooseberries, and several bushels of common blue plums, which the\r\ncurculio does not sting. When my wife discovered there was so ready a\r\nmarket at our own door, she suffered nothing to go to waste. It was a\r\nnew feature in her experience--every thing seemed to sell. Whenever she\r\nneeded a new dress for herself or any of the children, all she had to do\r\nwas to go to the store, get it, and have it charged against her garden\r\nfund. I confess that her success greatly exceeded my expectations.\r\n\r\nLet me now put in a word as to the cause of this success with our\r\ngarden. It was not owing to our knowledge of gardening, for we made many\r\nblunders not here recorded, and lost crops of two or three different\r\nthings in consequence. Neither was it owing to excessive richness of\r\nthe ground. But I lay it to the unsparing warfare kept up upon the\r\nweeds, which thus prevented their running away with the nourishment\r\nintended for the plants, and kept the ground constantly stirred up and\r\nthoroughly pulverized. I have sometimes thought one good stirring up,\r\nwhether with the hoe, the rake, or the cultivator, was as beneficial as\r\na good shower.\r\n\r\nWhen vegetables begin to look parched and the ground becomes dry, some\r\ngardeners think they must commence the use of the watering-pot. This\r\npractice, to a certain extent, and under some circumstances, may perhaps\r\nbe proper, but as a general rule it is incorrect. The same time spent in\r\nhoeing, frequently stirring the earth about vegetables, is far\r\npreferable. When watering has once commenced it must be continued, must\r\nbe followed up, else you have done mischief instead of good; as, after\r\nwatering a few times, and then omitting it, the ground will bake harder\r\nthan if nothing had been done to it. Not so with hoeing or raking. The\r\nmore you stir the ground about vegetables, the better they are off; and\r\nwhenever you stop hoeing, no damage is done, as in watering. Vegetables\r\nwill improve more rapidly, be more healthy, and in better condition at\r\nmaturity, by frequent hoeing than by frequent watering. This result is\r\nvery easily shown by experiment. Just notice, after a dewy night, the\r\ndifference between ground lately and often stirred, and that which has\r\nlain unmoved for a long time. Or take two cabbage plants under similar\r\ncircumstances; water one and stir the other just as often, stirring the\r\nearth about it carefully and thoroughly, and see which will distance the\r\nother in growth.\r\n\r\nThere are secrets about this stirring of the earth which chemists and\r\nhorticulturists would do well to study with the utmost scrutiny and\r\ncare. Soil cultivated in the spring, and then neglected, soon settles\r\ntogether. The surface becomes hard, the particles cohere, they attract\r\nlittle or no moisture, and from such a surface even the rain slides off,\r\napparently doing little good. But let this surface be thoroughly\r\npulverized, though it be done merely with an iron rake, and only a few\r\ninches in depth, and a new life is infused into it. The surface becomes\r\nfriable and soft, the moisture of the particles again becomes active,\r\nattracting and being attracted, each seeming to be crying to his\r\nneighbor, “Hand over, hand over--more drink, more drink.” Why this\r\nelaboration should grow less and less, till in a comparatively short\r\ntime it should seem almost to cease, is a question of very difficult\r\nsolution; though the varying compositions of soils has doubtless\r\nsomething to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nBut let the stirring be carefully repeated, and all is life again.\r\nParticles attract moisture from the atmosphere, hand it to each other,\r\ndown it goes to the roots of vegetables, the little suction fibres drink\r\nit in; and though we cannot see these busy operations, yet we perceive\r\ntheir healthy effects in the pushing up of vegetables above the surface.\r\nThe hoe is better than the water-pot. My garden is a signal illustration\r\nof the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCHEATED IN A COW--A GOOD AND A BAD ONE--THE SAINT OF THE BARNYARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth myself and wife had always coveted a cow. All of the family were\r\nextravagantly fond of milk. Where so many children were about, it seemed\r\nindispensable to have one; besides, were we not upon a farm? and what\r\nwould a farm be without having upon it at least one saint of the\r\nbarnyard? As soon as we came on the place, I made inquiries of two or\r\nthree persons for a cow. The news flew round the neighborhood with\r\namazing rapidity, and in the course of two weeks I was besieged with\r\noffers. They haunted me in the street, as I went daily to the\r\npost-office; even in the evening, as we sat in our parlor. It seemed as\r\nif everybody in the township had a cow to sell. Indeed, the annoyance\r\ncontinued long after we had been supplied.\r\n\r\nNow, though I knew a great deal of milk, having learned to like it the\r\nvery day I was born, yet I was utterly ignorant of how to choose a cow,\r\nand at that time had no friend to advise with. But I suspected that no\r\none who had a first-rate animal would voluntarily part with it, and so\r\nexpected to be cheated. I hinted as much to my wife, whereupon she\r\nbegged that the choice might be left to her; to which I partially\r\nconsented, thinking that if we should be imposed on, I should feel\r\nbetter if the imposition could be made chargeable somewhere else than to\r\nmy own ignorance. Besides, I knew that she could hardly be worse cheated\r\nthan myself.\r\n\r\nOne morning a very respectable-looking old man drove a cow up to the\r\ndoor, and called us out to look at her. My wife was pleased with her\r\nlooks the moment she set eyes on her, while the children were delighted\r\nwith the calf, some two weeks old. I did not like her movements--she\r\nseemed restless and ill-tempered; but the old man said that was always\r\nthe way with cows at their first calving. Still, I should not have\r\nbought her. But somehow my wife seemed bewitched in her favor, and was\r\ndetermined to have her. This the old man could not fail to notice, and\r\nwas loud in extolling her good qualities, declaring that she would give\r\ntwenty quarts of milk a day. After some further parley, he inadvertently\r\nadmitted that she had never been milked. My wife did not notice this\r\nstriking discrepancy of a cow giving twenty quarts daily, when as yet no\r\none had ever milked her; but the lie was too bouncing a one to escape my\r\nnotice. As I saw my wife had set her heart upon the cow, I said nothing,\r\nand finally bought cow and calf for thirty dollars, though quite certain\r\nthey could have been had for five dollars less, if my wife had not so\r\nplainly shown to the old sinner that she was determined to have them. I\r\ndo not think she will ever be up to me in making a bargain. But as it\r\nhad been agreed that she should choose a cow, so she was permitted to\r\nhave her own way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week the calf was sold for three dollars--a low\r\nprice; but then my wife wanted the milk, and she and Kate were anxious\r\nto begin the milking. I am sure I was quite willing they should have all\r\nthey could get. When they did begin, there was a great time. Now, most\r\nwomen profess to understand precisely how a cow should be milked, and\r\nyet comparatively few know any thing about it. They remind me of the\r\nIrish girls who are hunting places. These are all first-rate cooks, if\r\nyou take their word for it, and yet not one in a hundred knows any thing\r\nof even the first principles of cooking.\r\n\r\nThe first process in the operation of milking is to fondle with the cow,\r\nmake her acquaintance, and thus give her to understand that the man or\r\nmaid with the milking pail approaches her with friendly intentions, in\r\norder to relieve her of the usual lacteal secretion. It will never do to\r\napproach the animal with combative feelings and intentions. Should the\r\nmilker be too impetuous; should he swear, speak loud and sharp, scold or\r\nkick, or otherwise abuse or frighten the cow, she will probably prove\r\nrefractory as a mule, and may give the uncouth and unfeeling milker the\r\nbenefit of her heels,--a very pertinent reward, to which he, the uncouth\r\nmilker, is justly entitled. Especially in the case of a new milker, who\r\nmay be a perfect stranger to the cow, the utmost kindness and\r\ndeliberation are necessary.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing to milk, a cow should be fed, or have some kind of\r\nfodder offered her, in view of diverting her attention from the\r\noperation of milking. By this means the milk is not held up, as the\r\nsaying is, but is yielded freely. All these precautions are more\r\nindispensable when the cow has just been deprived of her calf. She is\r\nthen uneasy, fretful, and irritable, and generally so disconsolate as to\r\nneed the kindest treatment and the utmost soothing. The milker should be\r\nin close contact with the cow’s body, for in this position, if she\r\nattempt to kick him, he gets nothing more than a push, whereas if he\r\nsits off at a distance, the cow has an opportunity to inflict a severe\r\nblow whenever she feels disposed to do so.\r\n\r\nAll milkers of cows should understand that the udder and teats are\r\nhighly organized, and consequently very sensitive; and these facts\r\nshould be taken into consideration by amateur milkers, especially when\r\ntheir first essay is made on a young animal after the advent of her\r\nfirst calf, and that one just taken from her. At this period, the hard\r\ntugging and squeezing to which many poor dumb brutes have to submit in\r\nconsequence of the application of hard-fisted, callous, or inexperienced\r\nfingers, is a barbarity of the very worst kind; for it often converts a\r\ndocile creature into a vicious one, from which condition it is extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to wean her.\r\n\r\nOf every one of these requisites both wife and daughter were utterly\r\nignorant. They went talking and laughing into the barn, one with a\r\nbright tin pail in her hand, an object which the cow had never before\r\nseen, and both made at her, forgetting that they were utter strangers to\r\nher. Besides, she was thinking of her absent calf, and did not want to\r\nsee any thing else. Their appearance and clamor of course frightened\r\nher, and as they approached her, so she avoided them. They followed, but\r\nshe continued to avoid, and once or twice put down her head shook it\r\nmenacingly, and even made an incipient lunge at them with her sharply\r\npointed horns. These decided demonstrations of anger frightened them in\r\nturn, and they forthwith gave up the pursuit of milk in the face of\r\ndifficulties so unexpected. We got none that night. In the morning we\r\nsent for an experienced milker, but she had the utmost difficulty in\r\ngetting the cow to stand quiet even for a moment. My wife was quite\r\nsubdued about the matter. It would never do to keep a cow that nobody\r\ncould milk. She said but little, however--it was _her_ cow. Longer trial\r\nproduced no more encouraging result, as she seemed untamable, and my\r\nwife was glad to have me sell her for twenty dollars, at the same time\r\nresolving never again to buy a cow with her first calf.\r\n\r\nIt was voted unanimously that another should be procured, and that this\r\ntime the choice should be left to me. Now, I never had any idea of\r\nbuying poor things of any kind merely because they were cheap. When\r\npurchasing or making tools or machinery, I never bought or made any but\r\nthe very best, as I found that even a good workman could never do a good\r\njob with poor tools. So with all my farm implements--I bought the best\r\nof their kind that could be had. If my female gardeners had been\r\nfurnished with heavy and clumsy hoes and rakes, because such were cheap,\r\ntheir mere weight would have disgusted them with the business of hoeing\r\nand weeding. So with a cow. It is true, I had become the owner of a\r\nmagnificent thirty-dollar horse; but it was the only beast I could get\r\nhold of at the moment when a horse must be had. Besides, he turned out\r\nto be like a singed cat, a vast deal better than he looked.\r\n\r\nI had repeatedly heard of a cow in the neighboring town, which was said\r\nto yield so much milk as to be the principal support of a small family\r\nwhose head was a hopeless drunkard. She had cost seventy-five dollars,\r\nand had been a present to the drunkard’s wife from one of her relatives.\r\nBy careful inquiry, I satisfied myself that this cow gave twenty quarts\r\ndaily, and that five months after calving, and on very indifferent\r\npasture. I went to see her, and then her owner told me she was going to\r\nleave the place, and would sell the cow for fifty dollars. I did not\r\nhesitate a moment, but paid the money and had the cow brought home the\r\nsame evening. My wife and daughter had not the least difficulty in\r\nlearning to milk her. Under their treatment and my improved feeding, we\r\nkept her in full flow for a long time. She gave quite as much milk as\r\ntwo ordinary cows, while we had the expense of keeping only one. This I\r\nconsider genuine good management: the best is always the cheapest.\r\n\r\nThe cow was never permitted to go out of the barnyard. A trough of water\r\nenabled her to drink as often as she needed, but her green food was\r\nbrought to her regularly three times daily, with double allowance at\r\nnight. I began by mowing all the little grass-plots about the house and\r\nlanes, for in these sheltered nooks the sod sends up a heavy growth far\r\nin advance of field or meadow. But this supply was soon exhausted,\r\nthough it lasted more than a week: besides, these usually neglected\r\nnooks afforded several mowings during the season, and the repeated\r\ncuttings produced the additional advantage of maintaining the sod in\r\nbeautiful condition, as well as getting rid of numberless weeds. When\r\nthe grass had all been once mowed over, we resorted to the clover. This\r\nalso was mowed and taken to her; and by this treatment my little\r\nclover-field held out astonishingly. Long before I had gone over it\r\nonce, the portion first mowed was up high enough to be mowed again.\r\nIndeed, we did secure some hay in addition. In this way both horse and\r\ncow were soiled. When the clover gave out, the green corn which I had\r\nsowed in rows was eighteen inches to two feet high, and in capital\r\ncondition to cut and feed. It then took the place of clover. Both horse\r\nand cow devoured it with high relish. It was the extra sweet corn now so\r\nextensively cultivated in New Jersey for market, and contained an excess\r\nof saccharine matter, which made it not only very palatable, but which\r\nsensibly stimulated the flow of milk.\r\n\r\nThe yield of green food which this description of corn gives to the\r\nacre, when thus sowed, is enormous. Not having weighed it, I cannot\r\nspeak as to the exact quantity, but should judge it to be at least seven\r\ntimes that of the best grass or clover. Even without cutting up with a\r\nstraw-knife, the pigs ate it with equal avidity. In addition to this,\r\nthe cow was fed morning and night with a little bran. The unconsumed\r\ncorn, after being dried where it grew, was cut and gathered for winter\r\nfodder, and when cut fine and mixed with turnips which had been passed\r\nthrough a slicer, kept the cow in excellent condition. She of course\r\ngot many an armful of cabbage-leaves during the autumn and all through\r\nthe winter, with now and then a sprinkling of sliced pumpkins, from\r\nwhich the seeds had first been taken, as they are sure to diminish the\r\nflow of milk.\r\n\r\nThus I was obliged to lay out no money for either horse or cow, except\r\nthe few dollars expended for bran. By this treatment I secured all the\r\nmanure they made. By feeding the barnyard itself, as well as the\r\nhog-pen, with green weeds and whatever litter and trash could be\r\ngathered up, the end of the season found me with a huge manure pile, all\r\nnicely collected under a rough shed, out of reach of drenching rain, hot\r\nsun, and wasting winds. I certainly secured thrice as much in one season\r\nas had ever been made on that place in three. In addition to this, the\r\nfamily had had more milk than they could use, fresh, rich, and buttery.\r\nEven the pigs fell heir to an occasional bucket of skim-milk.\r\n\r\nWhen our city friends came to spend a day or two with us, we were able\r\nto astonish them with a tumbler of thick cream, instead of the usual\r\nstaple beverages of the tea-table. My wife evidently felt a sort of\r\npride in making a display of this kind, and Kate invariably spread\r\nherself by taking our visitors to the barnyard, to let them see how\r\nexpert she had become at milking. When they remarked, at table, on the\r\nsurpassing richness of the cream, as well as the milk, my wife was very\r\napt to reply--\r\n\r\n“Yes, but when your turn comes to go in the country, be particular not\r\nto buy a cheap cow.”\r\n\r\nThis remark generally led to inquiry, and then Kate was brought out\r\nwith the whole story of our first and second cow, which she accordingly\r\ngave with illustrations infinitely more amusing than any I have been\r\nable to introduce. Indeed, her power of amplification sometimes\r\nastonished me. She told the story of our having been cheated by the old\r\nsinner, with such graphic liveliness, my wife now and then interposing a\r\nparenthesis, that the company invariably concluded it was by far the\r\nbetter policy to give a wide berth to cheap cows. I am not certain\r\nwhether the fun occasioned by Kate’s narratives was not really very\r\ncheaply purchased by the small loss we suffered on that occasion.\r\n\r\nThis abundance of milk wrought quite a change in our habits as to tea\r\nand coffee. At supper, during the summer, we drank milk only; but\r\ninsensibly we ran on in the same way into cold weather. In the end, we\r\nfound that we liked coffee in the morning only. This was a clear saving,\r\nbesides being quite as wholesome. Our city milk bill had usually been a\r\ndollar a week. I am quite sure it did not cost over sixty cents a week\r\nto keep the cow. Then we had puddings and other dishes, which milk alone\r\nmakes palatable, whenever we wanted them; and at any time of a hot\r\nsummer’s day a full draught of cold milk was always within reach. Then\r\nthe quality was much superior, exceeding any thing to be found in city\r\nmilk. I must admit that keeping a cow, like most other good things,\r\ninvolves some trouble; but my family would cheerfully undertake twice as\r\nmuch as they have ever had with ours, rather than dispense with this yet\r\nuncanonized saint of the barnyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nA CLOUD OF WEEDS--GREAT SALES OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune came without my being obliged to hire any thing but occasional help\r\non the farm. But when the month was fairly set in, I found every inch of\r\nmy ploughed land in a fair way of being smothered by the weeds. I was\r\namazed at the countless numbers which sprang up, as well as at the\r\nrapidity with which they grew. There was almost every variety of these\r\npests. It seemed as if the whole township had concentrated its wealth of\r\nweeds upon my premises. In the quick, warm soil of New Jersey, they\r\nappear to have found a most congenial home, as they abound on every farm\r\nthat I have seen. Cultivators appear to have abandoned all hope of\r\neradicating them. Knowing that the last year’s crop had gone to seed, I\r\nconfess to looking for something of the kind, but I was wholly\r\nunprepared for the thick haze which everywhere covered the ground.\r\n\r\nI can bear any quantity of snakes, but for weeds I have a sort of\r\nreligious aversion. I tried one week to overcome them with the\r\ncultivator, but I made discouraging headway. I then bought a regular\r\nhorse-weeder, which cut them down rapidly and effectually. But meantime\r\nothers were growing up in the rows, and corners, and by-places, where\r\nnothing but the hoe could reach them, and robbing the crops of their\r\nsupport. It would never do to cultivate weeds--they must be got rid of\r\nat any cost, or my crops would be worthless. Several neighboring\r\nfarmers, who had doubtless counted on this state of things, came along\r\nabout the time they supposed my hands would be full, looked over the\r\nfence at my courageous onslaught, laughed, and called out, “It’s no\r\nuse--you can’t kill the weeds!” Such was the sympathy they afforded. If\r\nmy house had been on fire, every one of them would have promptly hurried\r\nto the rescue; but to assist a man in killing his weeds was what no one\r\ndreamed of doing. He didn’t kill his own.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma I was forced to hire a young man to help me, contracting\r\nto give him twelve dollars a month and board him. He turned out sober\r\nand industrious. We went to work courageously on the weeds. I will admit\r\nthat my man Dick was quite as certain as my neighbors that we could\r\nnever get permanently ahead of them, and that thus lacking faith he took\r\nhold of the cultivator and weeder, while I attacked the enemy in the\r\nrows and by-places. I kept him constantly at it, and worked steadily\r\nmyself. A week’s labor left a most encouraging mark upon the ground. The\r\nhot sun wilted and dried up the weeds as we cut them off. Two weeks\r\nenabled us to get over the whole lot, making it look clean and nice. I\r\ncongratulated myself on our success, and inquired of Dick if he didn’t\r\nthink we had got ahead of the enemy now. This was on a Saturday evening.\r\nDick looked up at the sky, which was then black and showery, with a warm\r\nsouth wind blowing, and a broad laugh came over his features as he\r\nreplied, “This will do till next time.” The fellow was evidently\r\nunwilling either to encourage or to disappoint me.\r\n\r\nThat night a powerful rain fell, with a warm sultry wind, being what\r\nfarmers call “growing weather.” I found it to be even so, good for weeds\r\nat least. Monday morning came with a hot, clear sun, and, under the\r\ncombined stimulating power of sun, rain, and temperature, I found that\r\nin two nights a new generation had started into life, quite as numerous\r\nas that we had just overcome. As I walked over the ground in company\r\nwith Dick, I was confounded at the sight. But I noticed that he\r\nexpressed no astonishment whatever--it was just what he knew was to\r\ncome--and so he declared it would be if we made the ground as clean as a\r\nparlor every week.\r\n\r\nHe said he never knew the weeds to be got out of Jersey ground, and\r\nprotested that it couldn’t be done. He admitted that they were\r\nnuisances, but so were mosquitoes. But as neither, in his opinion, did\r\nany great harm, so he thought it not worth while to spend much time or\r\nmoney in endeavoring to get rid of them. In either case he considered\r\nthe attempt a vain one, and this was the whole extent of his philosophy.\r\nHe had in fact been educated to believe in weeds. I was mortified at his\r\nindifference, for I had labored to infuse into his mind the same hatred\r\nof the tribe with which my wife and Kate had been so happily inoculated.\r\nBut Dick was proof against inoculation--his system repudiated it.\r\n\r\nBut it set me to thinking. As to defining what a weed was, I did not\r\nundertake that, beyond pronouncing it to be a plant growing out of its\r\nproper place. Neither did I undertake to settle the question as to the\r\nendless variety there seemed to be of these pests, nor by what\r\nunaccountable agency they had become so thoroughly diffused over the\r\nearth. I could not fail to admit, however, that it seemed, in the\r\nprovidence of God, that whenever man ceased to till the ground and cover\r\nit with cultivated crops, at his almighty command there sprung up a\r\nprofuse vegetation with which to clothe its nakedness. While man might\r\nbe idle, it was impossible for nature to be so--the earth could not lie\r\nbarren of every thing. But it seemed to me impossible that these ten\r\nacres of mine could contain an absolutely indefinite number of seeds of\r\nthese unwelcome plants. There must be some limitation of the number. At\r\nwhat figure did it stop? Was it one million, or a hundred millions?\r\nNeither Dick nor myself could answer this question.\r\n\r\nYet I came resolutely to the conclusion that there must be a limitation,\r\nand that if we could induce all the seeds contained in the soil to\r\nvegetate, and then destroy the plants before they matured a new crop, we\r\nshould ever afterwards be excused from such constant labor as we had\r\ngone through, and as was likely to be our experience in the future. I\r\nsubmitted this proposition to Dick--that if we killed all the weeds as\r\nthey grew, the time would come when there would be no weeds to kill. It\r\nstruck me as being so simple that even Dick, with all his doggedness,\r\ncould neither fail to comprehend nor acknowledge it. He did manage to\r\ncomprehend it, but as to acknowledging its force, one might have argued\r\nwith him for a month. He utterly denied the premises--he had no faith in\r\nour Jersey weeds ever being killed, no matter how much luck we had thus\r\nfar had with them, and I would see that he was right.\r\n\r\nBut having originated the dogma, I fully believed in it, and felt bound\r\nto maintain it; so Dick and I went resolutely to work a second time, as\r\nsoon as the new crop was well out of the ground. The labor was certainly\r\nnot as great as on the first crop, but it was hot work. I carried a file\r\nin my pocket, and kept my hoe as sharp as I have always kept my carving\r\nknife, and taught Dick to put his horse-weeder in prime order every\r\nevening when we had quit work. The perspiration ran in a stream from me\r\nin the hot sun, and a few blisters rose on my hands, but my appetite was\r\nrampant, and never have my slumbers been so undisturbed and peaceful.\r\n\r\nAbout the third week in June we got through the second cleaning, and\r\nthen rested. From that time to the end of the first week in July there\r\nhad been no rain, with a powerfully hot sun. During this interval the\r\nweeds grew again, and entirely new generations, some few of the first\r\nvarieties, but the remainder being new sorts. Thus there were\r\nwet-weather weeds and dry-weather weeds; and as I afterwards found,\r\nthere was a regular succession of varieties from spring to winter, and\r\neven into December--cold-weather weeds as well as hot-weather weeds.\r\nAgainst each new army as it showed itself an onslaught was to be made. I\r\nwas persuaded in my mind that the same army which we killed this year\r\ncould not show itself the next, and that therefore there ought to be\r\nthat number less. But Dick could not see this.\r\n\r\nI observed, moreover, that each variety had its particular period when\r\nit vegetated, so that it might have time to get ahead and keep out of\r\nthe way of its successor. It was evident that the seeds of any one kind\r\ndid not all vegetate the same season. Herein was a wonderful provision\r\nof Providence to insure the perpetuity of all; for if all the rag-weed,\r\nfor instance, had vegetated the first season of my experience, they\r\nwould assuredly have been killed. But multitudes remained dormant in the\r\nearth, as if thus stored up for the purpose of repairing, another year,\r\nthe casualties which their forerunners had encountered during the\r\npresent one. Thus no one weed can be extirpated in a single season;\r\nneither do we have the whole catalogue to attack at the same time.\r\n\r\nMy warfare against the enemy continued unabated. As the time came for\r\neach new variety to show itself, so we took it in hand with hoe and\r\nweeder. Dick and his horse made such admirable progress, that I cannot\r\nrefrain from recommending this most efficient tool to the notice of\r\nevery cultivator. With one man and a horse it will do the work of six\r\nmen, cutting off the weeds just below the ground and leaving them to\r\nwilt on the surface. It costs but six dollars, and can be had in all the\r\ncities. It would have cost me a hundred dollars to do the same amount of\r\nwork with the hoe, which this implement did within four weeks.\r\n\r\nThus aided, our labors extended clear into November. In the intervals\r\nbetween the different growths of weeds, we looked after the other crops.\r\nBut when the winter closed in upon us, the whole ground was so\r\nthoroughly cleaned of them as to be the admiration of the jeerers and\r\ncroakers who, early in the season, had pitied my enthusiasm or ridiculed\r\nmy anticipations. Even Dick was somewhat subdued and doubtful. I do not\r\nthink a single weed escaped our notice, and went to seed that season.\r\n\r\nI saw this year a beautiful illustration of the idea that there are\r\nspecific manures for certain plants. I can hardly doubt that each has\r\nits specific favorite, and that if cultivators could discover what that\r\nfavorite is, our crops might be indefinitely increased. On a piece of\r\nground which had been sowed with turnips, on which guano had previously\r\nbeen sprinkled during a gentle rain, there sprang up the most marvellous\r\ngrowth of purslane that ever met one’s eyes. The whole ground was\r\ncovered with the rankest growth of this weed that could be imagined.\r\nEvery turnip was smothered out. It seemed as if the dormant\r\npurslane-seed had been instantly called into life by the touch of the\r\nguano. It was singular, too, that we had noticed no purslane growing on\r\nthat particular spot previous to the application of this rapidly-acting\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nI confess the sight of a dense carpet of purslane instead of a crop of\r\nturnips, almost staggered me as to the correctness of my theory that the\r\nnumber of seeds in the ground, yet to vegetate, must somewhere have a\r\nlimit. Here were evidently millions of a kind which, up to this time,\r\nhad not even showed themselves. After allowing the purslane to grow two\r\nweeks, Dick cut it off with his horse-weeder, raked it up, and carried\r\nit to the pigs, who consumed it with avidity. We then recultivated the\r\nground and sowed again with turnips; but the yield was very poor. Either\r\nthe purslane had appropriated the whole energy of the guano, or the\r\nsowing was too late in the season.\r\n\r\nBut this little incident will illustrate the value of observation to a\r\nfarmer. Book-farming is a good thing in its place, but observation is\r\nequally instructive. The former is not sufficient, of itself, to make\r\ngood tillers of the soil. It will not answer in place of attentive\r\nobservation. It forms, indeed, but the poorest kind of a substitute for\r\nthat habit which every farmer should cultivate, of going all over his\r\npremises daily during the growing season, and noticing the peculiarities\r\nof particular plants; the habits of destructive animals or insects; the\r\ndepredations as well as the services of birds; the when, the how, and\r\nthe apparent wherefore of the germination of seeds; the growth of the\r\nstem, the vine, or the stalk that proceeds from them, and the formation,\r\ngrowth, and ripening of the fruit which they bear. Let no farmer,\r\nfruit-grower, or gardener, neglect observation for an exclusive reliance\r\non book-farming.\r\n\r\nIt would be a most erroneous conclusion for the reader to suppose that\r\nall this long-continued labor in keeping the ground clear of weeds was\r\nso much labor thrown away. On the contrary, even apart from ridding the\r\nsoil of so many nuisances, so many robbers of the nourishment provided\r\nfor useful plants, it kept the land in the most admirable condition. The\r\ngood conferred upon the garden by hoeing and raking, was re-enacted\r\nhere. Every thing I had planted grew with surprising luxuriance. I do\r\nthink it was an illustration of the value of thorough culture, made so\r\nmanifest that no one could fail to observe it. It abundantly repaid me\r\nfor all my watchfulness and care. Dick was forced to acknowledge that he\r\nhad seen no such clean work done in that part of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nMy nurseryman came along at the end of the season, to see how I had\r\nfared, and walked deliberately over the ground with me, examining the\r\npeach-trees. He said he had never seen young trees grow more vigorously.\r\nNot one of them had died. The raspberries had not grown so much as he\r\nexpected, but the strawberry-rows were now filled with plants. As\r\nrunners were thrown out, I had carefully trained them in line with the\r\nparent stools, not permitting them to sprawl right and left over a great\r\nsurface, forming a mass that could not be weeded, even by hand. This he\r\ndid not approve of. He said by letting them spread out right and left\r\nthe crop of fruit would be much greater, but admitted that the size of\r\nthe berries would be much smaller. But he contended that _quantity_ was\r\nwhat the public wanted, and that they did not care so much for\r\n_quality_. Yet he could not explain the damaging fact that the largest\r\nsized fruit was always the most eagerly sought after, and invariably\r\ncommanded the highest price. Though he did not approve of my mode of\r\ncultivation, yet he could not convince me that I had made a mistake.\r\n\r\nFrom these we walked over to the blackberries. They, too, had grown\r\nfinely under my thorough culture of the ground. Besides sending up good\r\ncanes which promised a fair crop the next season, each root had sent up\r\nseveral suckers, some of them several feet away, and out of the line of\r\nthe row. These I had intended to sell, and had preserved as many as\r\npossible, knowing there would be a demand for all. The interest in the\r\nnew berry had rapidly extended all round among my neighbors, and I very\r\nsoon discovered that my nurseryman wanted to buy. In fact, I believe he\r\ncame more for that purpose than to see how I was doing. But I talked\r\noffish--spoke of having engaged two or three lots, and could hardly\r\nspeak with certainty. Finally, he offered to give me a receipt for the\r\n$120 he was to receive out of the strawberries he had sold me, and pay\r\nme $100 down, for a thousand blackberry plants. Though I felt pretty\r\nsure I could do better, yet I closed with him. As he had evidently come\r\nprepared with money to clinch some sort of bargain, he produced it and\r\npaid me on the spot. He afterwards retailed nearly all of the plants for\r\na much larger sum. But it was a good bargain for both of us. It paid me\r\nwell, and was all clear profit.\r\n\r\nI may add that these blackberry roots came into more active demand from\r\nthat time until the next spring; and when spring opened, more suckers\r\ncame up, as if knowing they were wanted. These, with my previous stock,\r\namounted to a large number. A seed-man in the city advertised them for\r\nsale, and took retail orders for me. His sales, with my own, absorbed\r\nevery root I could spare. When they had all been disposed of, and my\r\nreceipts were footed up, I found that they amounted to four hundred and\r\nsixty dollars, leaving me three hundred and forty dollars clear, after\r\npaying for my strawberry plants.\r\n\r\nThis was far better than I had anticipated. It may sound curiously now,\r\nwhen the plants can be had so cheaply, but it is a true picture of the\r\nmarket at the time of which I write. It is the great profit to be\r\nrealized from the sale of new plants that stimulates their cultivation.\r\nMany men have made fortunes from the sale of a new fruit or flower, and\r\nothers are repeating the operation now. In fact, it is the hope of this\r\ngreat gain that has given to the world so many new and valuable plants,\r\nsome originated from seed, some by hybridization, some from solitary\r\nhiding-places in the woods and mountains, and some by importation from\r\ndistant countries. Success in one thing stimulates to exertion for\r\nanother, and thus the race of a vast and intelligent competition is\r\nmaintained. But the public is the greatest gainer after all.\r\n\r\nMy profits from this source, the first year, may by some be regarded as\r\nan exceptional thing, to be realized only by the fortunate few, and not\r\nto be regularly counted on. But this is not the case. There are\r\nthousands of cultivators who are constantly in the market as purchasers.\r\nIf it were not so, the vast nursery establishments which exist all over\r\nthe country could not be maintained. Every fruit-grower, like myself,\r\nhas been compelled to buy in the beginning of his operations; but his\r\nturn for selling has invariably come round. As a general rule, whatever\r\noutlay a beginner makes in supplying himself with the smaller fruits, is\r\nafterwards reimbursed from the sale of surplus plants he does not need.\r\nThis sale occurs annually, and in time will far exceed his original\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\nIf the plants be rare in the market, and if he should have gone into the\r\npropagation at a very early day, before prices have found their lowest\r\nlevel, his profits will be the larger. Hence the utmost watchfulness of\r\nthe market should be maintained. New plants, better breeds of animals,\r\nand in fact every improvement connected with agriculture, if judiciously\r\nadopted at the earliest moment, will generally be found to pay, even\r\nafter allowing for losses on the numerous cheats which are continually\r\nturning up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPIGS AND POULTRY--LUCK AND ILL LUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery early after taking possession, I invested twelve dollars in the\r\npurchase of seven pigs of the ordinary country breed. They were wanted\r\nto eat the many odds and ends which are yielded by ten acres, a good\r\ngarden, and the kitchen. I did not look for much money profit from them,\r\nbut I knew they were great as architects in building up a manure heap.\r\nYet they were capital things with which to pack a meat-tub at Christmas,\r\nsaving money from the butcher, as well as much running abroad to market.\r\nThey shared with the cow in the abundant trimmings and surplus from the\r\ngarden, eating many things which she rejected, and appropriating all the\r\nslop from the kitchen. In addition to this, we fed them twice a day with\r\nboiled bran, sometimes with a handful of corn meal, but never upon whole\r\ncorn. This cooking of the food was no great trouble in the kitchen, but\r\nits effect on the pigs was most beneficial. They grew finely, except one\r\nwhich died after four months’ feeding, but from what cause could not be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that when October came round, the six remaining\r\nones were estimated by Dick to average at least one hundred and fifty\r\npounds each, and were in prime condition for fattening. In the early\r\npart of that month their supply of cooked mush was increased. I am of\r\nopinion that farmers leave the fattening of their hogs too late, and\r\nthat a month on corn, before December, is worth three months after it.\r\nBy the tenth of December they were ready for the butcher, and on being\r\nkilled, were found to average two hundred and twenty-four pounds, or\r\nnine hundred and forty-four in all. This being three times as much as we\r\nneeded for home use, the remainder was sent to the store, where it\r\nnetted me forty-nine dollars.\r\n\r\nI am quite certain there was a profit on these pigs. They consumed\r\nquantities of refuse tomatoes, and devoured parsnips with the greatest\r\neagerness. One day I directed Dick to cut up some stalks of our green\r\nsweet corn, by means of the fodder-cutter, which delivers them in pieces\r\nhalf an inch long, and mix them with bran for the pigs. I found they\r\nconsumed it with great avidity. Ever after that they were served twice\r\ndaily with the same mess. It seemed to take the place of stronger food,\r\nas well as of grass, and was an acceptable variety. In this way the\r\nmoney cost of food was kept at a low figure, and the labor we spent on\r\nthe pigs showed itself in the fine yield of prime pork, which brought\r\nthe highest price in the market. The yield of rich manure was also very\r\nsatisfactory, all which, at intervals through the season, was removed\r\nfrom the pen and put under cover, for manure thus housed from the sun\r\nand rain is worth about double that which is exposed all the year round.\r\nThis was another item of profit: if the pigs had not manufactured it,\r\nmoney would have been required to pay for its equivalent.\r\n\r\nAfter these six had been killed, I purchased seven others, some two\r\nmonths old, having abundance of roots, offal cabbages, and a stack of\r\nthe sweet-corn fodder on hand. These seven cost the same as the others,\r\ntwelve dollars. As Dick was found to be a good, trustworthy fellow, he\r\nwas to be kept all the year round; and as he would be hanging about the\r\nbarnyard during the winter, when the ground was wet and sloppy, looking\r\nafter the horse and cow, the pigs would help to fill up his time. The\r\ncooking of food for both cow and pigs was a great novelty to him. At\r\nfirst he could not be made to believe in it. When I ventured to\r\ninsinuate to him that it would be any thing but agreeable to him to eat\r\nhis dinners raw, the force of the idea did not strike him. So much is\r\nthere in the power of long-established habit. Yet he did condescend to\r\nadmit that he knew all pigs throve better on plenty of common\r\nkitchen-swill than on almost any thing else. I told him there was but\r\none reason for this, and that was because all such swill had been\r\ncooked. When the improvement made by the first lot of pigs became too\r\nmanifest for even him to dispute, he, together with the pigs,\r\nacknowledged the corn and gave in.\r\n\r\nWhen out-door operations for the season were over, Dick undertook the\r\nwhole business of cooking for the pigs and cow himself. In fact, on one\r\noccasion I succeeded in getting him to curry down both cow and pigs.\r\nThey all looked and showed so much better for near a week thereafter,\r\nthat coming on him unexpectedly one day, I found him repeating the\r\noperation of his own motion, and so he voluntarily continued the\r\npractice during the whole winter. The pigs seemed delighted with the\r\nprocess, and had very little scratching of their own to do. Their backs\r\nand sides were kept continually smooth, while their whole appearance was\r\nchanged for the better. As to the cow, she took to being curried with\r\nthe best possible grace, and improved under it as much as the pigs; but\r\nwhether it increased the flow of milk I cannot say, as no means were\r\ntaken to solve that question. But as Dick’s devotion to the currycomb\r\nexcited my admiration, so there was abundant evidence that both pigs and\r\ncow were equally captivated.\r\n\r\nThis business of raising and carefully attending to only half a dozen\r\nhogs, is worthy of every small farmer’s serious study and attention. The\r\nhog and his food, with what is cheapest and best for him, is really one\r\nof the sciences, not an exact one, it is true, but still a science. One\r\nmust look at and study many things, and they can all be made to pay. The\r\npropensity to acquire fat in many animals seems to have been implanted\r\nby nature. The hog fattens most rapidly in such a condition of the\r\natmosphere as is most congenial to his comfort--not too hot, nor too\r\ncold. Hence the months of September, October, and November are the best\r\nfor making pork. The more agreeable the weather, the less is the amount\r\nof food required to supply the waste of life. It has been found by some\r\npersons that a clover-field is the best and cheapest place to keep hogs\r\nin during the spring and summer months, where they have a plenty of\r\nwater, the slop from the house, and the sour milk from the dairy. All\r\nsour feed contains more nitrogen than when fed in a sweet state. The\r\nfirst green herbage of the spring works off the impurities of the blood,\r\ncleanses the system, renovates the constitution, and enables the animal\r\nto accumulate a store of strength to carry it forward to its destined\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMany object to beginning the fattening process so early in the season,\r\nas the corn relied on for that purpose is not then fully matured. But,\r\ntaking all things into consideration, it is perhaps better to feed corn\r\nbefore it is ripe, as in that state it possesses more sweetness. Most\r\nvarieties are in milk in September, when the hogs will chew it, swallow\r\nthe juice, and eject the dry, fibrous matter. During the growing season\r\nof the year, swine can be fed on articles not readily marketable, as\r\nimperfect fruit, vegetables, &c. When such articles are used, cooking\r\nthem is always economical. Most vegetables, when boiled or steamed, and\r\nmixed with only an eighth of their bulk of mill-feed or meal, whey, and\r\nmilk left to sour, will fatten hogs fast. In this state they will eat it\r\nwith avidity, and derive more benefit from it than when fed in an\r\nunfermented state. Articles of a perishable nature should be used first,\r\nto prevent waste, as it is desirable to turn all the products of the\r\nfarm to the best account. Another quite important advantage of early\r\nfeeding is the less trouble in cooking the food. Convenience of feeding\r\nis promoted, as there is no cost nor trouble to guard against freezing.\r\n\r\nThe more you can mix the food, the better, as they will thrive faster on\r\nmixed food than when fed separately. In feeding, no more should be given\r\nat a time than is eaten up clean, and the feeding should be regular as\r\nto time. It is of the greatest importance to get the best varieties,\r\nthose that are well formed, and have an aptitude for taking on fat\r\nreadily, and consume the least food. As to which is the best kind, there\r\nseems to be a great diversity of opinion, some preferring one kind and\r\nsome another. The Suffolks come to maturity earliest, and probably are\r\nthe most profitable to kill at from seven to ten months; but others\r\nprefer the Berkshires. The pork of both is excellent: they will usually\r\nweigh from 250 to 300 pounds at the age of eight or ten months. The\r\nbetter way is to have the pigs dropped about the first of April, and\r\nfeed well until December, and then butcher.\r\n\r\nFrom a variety of experiments, I am satisfied it is wrong to let a hog\r\nremain poor twelve months of his life, when he could be made as large in\r\nnine months as he generally is in fifteen; and I conceive it a great\r\nerror to feed corn to hogs without grinding. It has been proved by the\r\nShakers, after thirty years’ trial, that ground corn is one-third better\r\nfor hogs and cattle-feed than if unground. In the case of another\r\nfeeder, he ascertained the ratio of gain to be even greater than that of\r\nthe Shakers. Others assert that cooking corn-meal nearly doubles its\r\nvalue. A distinguished agriculturist in Ohio proved that nineteen pounds\r\nof cooked meal were equal in value to fifty pounds raw. If pigs are well\r\nkept for three months after being dropped, they cannot be stunted after\r\nthat, even if the supply of food is less than it should be.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that hogs should be provided with a dry floor for eating\r\nand sleeping only, and the whole pen completely sheltered, to prevent\r\nany washing or waste of the manure. The commonwealth of the piggery\r\nshould be furnished with plenty of straw, potato-vines, leaves, sawdust,\r\nand the like, with an occasional load of muck, and almost any quantity\r\nof weeds, all of which will be converted into the most efficient\r\nsupports of vegetable life. Hogs are the best composters known, as they\r\ndelight in upturning any such article as the farmer wishes to convert\r\ninto manure for the coming year.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to its paying to make pork, though men\r\ndiffer on this as widely as their pork differs when brought to market.\r\nThe poorer the pork, the more the owner complains of his profits, or\r\nrather of his losses; and the better the pork, the more is the owner\r\nsatisfied. There can be no profit in raising a poor breed of hogs, that\r\nhave no fattening qualities; nor even a good breed, without conveniences\r\nor proper care. A good hog cannot be fatted to any profit in mud or\r\nfilth, nor where he suffers from cold. His comfort should be consulted\r\nas much as that of any other animal. It is a great error to assume that\r\nhe is naturally fond of living among filth. On the contrary, hogs are\r\nremarkably neat, and those which fatten the best always keep themselves\r\nthe cleanest. One farmer assured me that he had made his corn bring\r\n$1.25 per bushel by passing it through the bowels of his hogs, besides\r\nhaving the manure clear. Another did much better by cooking his meal.\r\n\r\nAs no farm is pronounced complete without poultry, and as both my wife\r\nand daughters were especially fond of looking after chickens,--at least\r\nthey thought they would be,--so, to make their new home attractive, I\r\ninvested $7 in the purchase of a cock and ten hens. They were warranted\r\nto be powerful layers, and would hatch fifteen eggs apiece. It struck me\r\nthat this sounded very large, but on my wife observing it would be only\r\na hundred and fifty chickens the first season, I gave in without a word.\r\nThe fact is that chickens were not my hobby. I did not think they would\r\npay, even after hearing my wife dilate on the luxury it would be to have\r\nfresh eggs every morning for breakfast, for pies and puddings, and\r\nvarious other things which she enumerated, and, as she expressed it,\r\n“eggs of our own laying.”\r\n\r\nI could not see how this circle of wonders was to be accomplished by\r\nonly ten hens, and insinuated that it would be a good thing if she could\r\nmake a bargain with each of her hens to lay two eggs a day. In reply to\r\nthis, she astonished me by saying that Americans did not know how to\r\nmake the most of things, but that the French did. She said that a\r\ncertain Frenchman, mentioning his name--he was either a marquis or\r\ncount, of course--had recently discovered the art of making hens lay\r\nevery day by feeding them on horse-flesh, and that he feeds out\r\ntwenty-five horses a day, which he obtains among the used-up hacks of\r\nParis. She said he had a hennery which furnishes forty thousand dozens\r\nof eggs a week, and that it yields the proprietor a clear profit of\r\nfive thousand dollars every seven days. After hearing this I felt\r\ncertain she had been reading some modern poultry-book. But as she did\r\nnot speak of requiring me to furnish horse-flesh for her pets, nor\r\ncontemplate the establishment of a fresh-laid egg company, but only\r\nsuggested the consumption of a little raw meat now and then, I\r\nvolunteered no objections. Her enthusiasm was such as to make it unsafe\r\nto do so. Why should not she and the children be gratified?\r\n\r\nThe hens came home, and were put into a cage in the barnyard, to\r\nfamiliarize them with their new home. But they did not lay so freely as\r\nshe had expected, while some did not lay at all. Worse than that, as\r\nsoon as let out of their cage, they got over the fence into the garden,\r\nwhere they scratched as violently as if each one had a brood of fifteen\r\nto scratch for. They made terrible havoc among the young flowers and\r\nvegetables, and tore up the beds which had been so nicely raked. One of\r\nthe girls was employed half her time in driving them out. I thought it\r\ntoo great an expense to raise the barnyard fence high enough to keep\r\nthem in, and so they were marched back into the cage. It happened to be\r\ntoo small for so many fowls, which my wife did not suspect, until one\r\nday, putting her hand in to draw forth a sick hen, she discovered her\r\nwhole arm and sleeve to be swarming with lice. Here was something she\r\ndid not remember to have been treated of in her poultry-book. But the\r\nnuisance was so great, as well as so active, soon extending itself all\r\nover her person, as to compel her to strip and change her entire dress,\r\nand to plunge the lousy one in a tub of water.\r\n\r\nI confess the difficulty was a new one to me. My experience in poultry\r\nhad been limited. My knowledge of them was exclusively anatomical,\r\nobtained by frequent dissections with the carving-knife. On calling\r\nDick, however, it appeared that he knew more about this trouble than the\r\nwhole family together. When my wife described her condition to him, and\r\nhow she had swarmed with the vermin, the fellow laughed outright, but\r\nsaid they wouldn’t hurt--he knew all about them, for he had been full of\r\nlice more than once! He said he expected this, as the fowls had been\r\nkept up too close: they would neither lay, thrive, nor keep clear of\r\nvermin, unless allowed to run about.\r\n\r\nBut he took the case in hand, clipped their wings, saturated their heads\r\nwith lamp oil, provided abundance of ashes for them to roll in, and then\r\nturned them loose in the barnyard. He then obtained poles of sassafras\r\nwood for them to roost on, as he said the peculiar odor of that tree\r\nwould drive the enemy away. I presume his prescriptions answered the\r\npurpose; at all events, we discovered no more hen-lice, because the\r\nwhole family were careful never to touch a fowl again.\r\n\r\nI think this little catastrophe took all the romance out of my wife\r\ntouching chickens. I rarely heard her mention eggs afterwards, except\r\nwhen some of us were going to the store for other things, and she was\r\ncareful never to purchase chickens with the feathers on. She never\r\nreferred to the hundred and fifty she was to hatch out that season; nor\r\nhave I ever heard her even mention horse-flesh as a sure thing for\r\nmaking hens lay all the year round. That winter Dick fattened and killed\r\nthe whole lot. My wife did not seem to have much stomach for them when\r\nthey came upon the table. I was not sorry for it, except that she had\r\nbeen disappointed. Her knowledge of keeping poultry had been purely\r\ntheoretical, and her first disappointment had completely weaned her of\r\nher fondness for the art.\r\n\r\nBut this brief and unlucky experience of ours should by no means operate\r\nto discourage others. Money is undoubtedly made by skilful men at\r\nraising poultry. It cannot be a losing business, or so many thousand\r\ntons would not be annually produced. Volumes have been written on the\r\nsubject, which all who contemplate embarking in the business may consult\r\nwith profit. As an incident of farm life it will always be interesting,\r\nand with those who understand the art it ought to be profitable.\r\n\r\nForeigners must be more experienced in the business of raising poultry\r\nthan Americans, judging by the vast quantities they annually produce for\r\nmarket. The quantity imported into England is so enormous, that it is\r\nimpossible to determine its amount. Into only two of the principal\r\nLondon markets there is annually brought from France and Belgium,\r\n75,000,000 eggs, 2,000,000 fowls, 400,000 pigeons, 200,000 geese and\r\nturkeys, and 300,000 ducks. In addition to these, the large amount sent\r\nto poulterers and private houses must be considered. The Brighton\r\nrailroad alone carries yearly 2,600 tons of eggs which come from France\r\nand Belgium. Yet, with all these immense supplies, the London markets\r\nare frequently very meagrely supplied with butter and eggs. The trade is\r\nshown by these figures to be one of great national value. Americans have\r\nstrangely neglected its cultivation with the method and precision of\r\nforeigners. We can raise food more cheaply than they, while none of them\r\ncan boast of possessing our incomparable Indian corn.\r\n\r\nThere are several of my neighbors who are highly skilled in the art of\r\nraising poultry. One of them is quite a poultry-fancier, and, by keeping\r\nonly choice breeds, he realizes fancy prices for them. Another confines\r\nhis fowls in a plum-orchard, and thus secures an annual crop of plums\r\nwithout being stung by the curculio. In general, the female portion of\r\nthe family attend to this branch of domestic business, and realize a\r\nsnug sum from it annually. A brood of young chickens turned into a\r\ngarden, the hen confined in her coop, will soon clear it of destructive\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCITY AND COUNTRY LIFE CONTRASTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pensive reader must not take it for granted that in going into the\r\ncountry we escaped all the annoyances of domestic life peculiar to the\r\ncity, or that we fell heir to no new ones, such as we had never before\r\nexperienced. He must remember that this is a world of compensations, and\r\nthat nowhere will he be likely to find either an unmixed good or an\r\nunmixed evil. Such was exactly our experience. But on summing up the\r\ntwo, the balance was decidedly in our favor. It is true that though the\r\ntown close by us had well-paved streets, yet the walk of half a mile to\r\nreach them was a mere gravel path, which was sometimes muddy in summer,\r\nand sloppy with unshovelled snow in winter. But I walked over it almost\r\ndaily to the post-office, not even imagining that it was worse than a\r\ncity pavement. The tramp of the children to school was not longer than\r\nthey had been used to, and my wife and daughters thought it no hardship\r\nto go shopping among the well-supplied stores quite as frequently as\r\nwhen living in the city. Indeed, I sometimes thought they went a little\r\noftener. They were certainly as well posted up as to the new fashions as\r\nthey had ever been, while the fresh country air, united with constant\r\nexercise, kept them in good appetite, even to the rounding of their\r\ncheeks, and the maintenance of a better color in them than ever.\r\n\r\nAs to society, they very soon made acquaintances quite as agreeable as\r\ncould be desired. Visiting became a very frequent thing; and after a few\r\nmonths I let in a suspicion that the girls found twice as many beaux as\r\nin the city, though there the average number is always larger than in\r\nthe country. On throwing out an insinuation of this kind to Kate, one\r\nsummer evening, after a large party of young folks had concluded their\r\nvisit, she made open confession that it was so, and volunteered her\r\nconviction that they were decidedly more agreeable. I admit this\r\nconfession did not surprise me, as there was one young man among the\r\nparty who had become especially attentive to Kate--bringing her the new\r\nmagazines as soon as they were out, sundry books and pictorials, and\r\nalways having a deal to say to her, with a singular genius for getting\r\nher away from the rest of the company, so that most of their mysterious\r\nsmall-talk could be heard by none but themselves. Another remark which I\r\nmade to Kate on a subsequent occasion, touching this subject, covered\r\nher bright face with so many blushes that I ventured to mention the\r\nwhole matter to my wife; but she made so light of the thing that I said\r\nno more at the time, thinking, perhaps, that the women were most likely\r\nthe best judges in such cases. But I have since discovered that my\r\nprognostications were much more to be depended on than hers.\r\n\r\nThen the walks for miles around us were excellent, and we all became\r\ngreat walkers, for walking we found to be good. Not merely stepping\r\nfrom shop to shop, or from neighbor to neighbor, but stretching away out\r\ninto the country, to the freshest fields, the shadiest woods, the\r\nhighest ridges, and the greenest lawns. We found that however sullen the\r\nimagination may have been among its griefs at home, here it cheered up\r\nand smiled. However listless the limbs may have been by steady toil,\r\nhere they were braced up, and the lagging gait became buoyant again.\r\nHowever stubborn the memory may be in presenting that only which was\r\nagonizing, and insisting on that which cannot be retrieved, on walking\r\namong the glowing fields it ceases to regard the former, and forgets the\r\nlatter. Indeed, we all came to esteem the mere breathing of the fresh\r\nwind upon the commonest highway to be rest and comfort, which must be\r\nfelt to be believed.\r\n\r\nBut then we had neither gas nor hydrant water, those two prime luxuries\r\nof city life. Yet there was a pump in a deep well under a shed at the\r\nkitchen door, from which we drew water so cold as not at any time to\r\nneed that other city luxury, ice. It was gratifying to see how expertly\r\neven the small children operated with the pump-handle. In a month we\r\nceased to regret the hydrants. As to gas, we had the modern lamps, which\r\ngive so clear a light not so convenient, it must be confessed, but then\r\nthey did not cost us over half as much, neither did we sit up near so\r\nlong at night. There were two mails from the city daily, and the newsboy\r\nthrew the morning paper into the front door while we sat at breakfast.\r\nThe evening paper came up from the city before we had supped. We had\r\ntwo daily mails from New York, besides a telegraph station. The baker\r\nserved us twice a day with bread, when we needed it; the oysterman\r\nbecame a bore, he rang the bell so often; and the fish-wagon, with\r\nsea-fish packed in ice, directly from the shore, was within call as\r\noften as we desired, with fish as cheap and sound as any to be purchased\r\nin the city. Groceries and provisions from the stores cost no more than\r\nthey did there, but they were no cheaper. But in the item of rent the\r\nsaving was enormous,--really half enough, in my case, to keep a moderate\r\nfamily. Many’s the time, when sweating over the weeds, have I thought of\r\nthis last heavy drain on the purse of the city toiler, and thanked\r\nHeaven that I had ceased to work for the landlord.\r\n\r\nWe had books as abundantly as aforetime, as we retained our share in the\r\ncity library, and became subscribers to that in the adjoining town. It\r\nis true that the road in front of us was never thronged like\r\nChestnut-street, but we neither sighed after the crowd nor missed its\r\npresence. We saw no flash of jewelry, nor heard the rustling of\r\nexpensive silks, except the few which on particular occasions were\r\nsported within our own unostentatious domicil. Our entire wardrobes were\r\nmanifestly on a scale less costly than ever. Our old city friends were\r\napparently a great way off, but as they could reach us in an hour either\r\nby steamboat or rail, they quickly found us out. The relish of their\r\nsociety was heightened by distance and separation. In short, while far\r\nfrom being hermits, we were happy in ourselves. I think my wife became\r\na perfectly happy woman--what it had been the great study of my wedded\r\nlife to make her--the very sparkle and sunshine of the house. She\r\npossessed the magic secret of being contented under any circumstances.\r\nThe current of my life had never been so dark and unpropitious, that the\r\nsunshine of her happy face, falling across its turbid course, failed to\r\nawake an answering gleam.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of visitors from abroad, I noticed that our city friends came\r\nto make their visits on the very hottest summer days, when, of all\r\nothers, we were ourselves sufficiently exhausted by the heat, and were\r\ndisposed to put up with as little cooking and in-door work as possible.\r\nBut as such visitations were not exactly comfortable to the visited, so\r\nwe could not see how they could be any more agreeable to the visitors.\r\nYet they generally remarked, even when the mercury was up to\r\nninety-five, “How much cooler it is in the country!” They did really\r\nenjoy either themselves or the heat. But my wife told them it was only\r\nthe change of scene that made the weather tolerable, and that if they\r\nlived in the country they would soon discover it to be quite as hot as\r\nin the city. For my part, I bore the heat admirably, though tanned by\r\nthe sun to the color of an aborigine; but I enjoyed the inexpressible\r\nluxury of going constantly in my shirt sleeves. I can hardly find words\r\nto describe the feeling of comfort which I enjoyed for full seven months\r\nout of the twelve from this little piece of latitudinarianism, the\r\nprivilege of country life, but an unknown luxury in the city.\r\n\r\nI saw that this press of company in the very hottest weather imposed an\r\nunpleasant burden on my wife, for she and my two oldest daughters were\r\nthe sole caterers; and I intended to say something to her concerning it,\r\nas soon as a large party, then staying several days with us, should have\r\nconcluded their visit. But on going into our chamber that very evening,\r\nshe surprised me by asking if I could tell her why, when Eve was made\r\nfrom one of Adam’s ribs, there was not a hired girl made at the same\r\ntime, for to her mind it took three to make a pair--he, she, and a hired\r\ngirl. I replied that I had not given much time to the study of\r\nnavigation, but that I quite understood her meaning, and that it was\r\nexactly what I had myself been thinking of. If Adam’s rib, after\r\nproducing Eve, had not held out to produce a hired girl also, I told her\r\nthere was a much quicker way of getting what she wanted, and that the\r\nfirst morning paper she might pick up would produce her twenty hired\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nIn this way, before the summer was over, I procured her a servant, thus\r\nmaking her little establishment complete. For this luxury we paid city\r\nwages. But this was a small item, when I saw how much her presence\r\nrelieved my wife. After that, I do not think she complained quite as\r\nmuch of the hot weather, nor was she inclined so frequently to repeat\r\nher former observation, that the sultry days always brought the most\r\ncompany. Indeed, I am certain that on one or two occasions, when the\r\ndog-days were terribly oppressive, she prevailed on different parties to\r\nprolong their stay for nearly a week.\r\n\r\nNow, this taking on of Betty did not imply that my daughters were to be\r\nbrought up to do nothing--or to do every thing that is fashionable\r\nimperfectly. My wife had already educated them in domestic duties--not\r\nmerely to marry, to go off _with_ husbands in a hurry, and afterwards\r\n_from_ them. To the two eldest she had taught a trade, and they were\r\nboth able to earn their salt. They could not only dress themselves, but\r\nknew how to make their dresses and bonnets, and all the clothing for the\r\nyounger children. She cultivated in them all that was necessary in the\r\nposition in which they were born, one thing at a time, but that thing in\r\nperfection; so that if parents were impoverished, or if in after-life\r\nreverses should overtake themselves, they might feel independent in the\r\nability to earn their own support. She frowned upon the senseless\r\nrivalries of social life, as destructive of morals, mind, and health,\r\nand imbued their spirits with a devout veneration for holy things. She\r\ntaught them no worship of the almighty dollar, but sound, practical\r\neconomy, the art of saving the pieces. Surely it must be education alone\r\nwhich fills the world with two kinds of girls--one kind which appears\r\nbest abroad, good for parties, rides, and visits, and whose chief\r\ndelight is in such things--good, in fact, for little else. The other is\r\nthe kind that appears best at home, graceful in the parlor, captivating\r\nin social intercourse, useful in the sick chamber as in the dining-room,\r\nand cheerful in all the precincts of home. They differ widely in\r\ncharacter. One is often the family torment; the other the family\r\nblessing: one a moth consuming every thing about her; the other a\r\nsunbeam, inspiring life and gladness all along her pathway. As my wife\r\nembodied in herself all that to me appeared desirable in woman, so she\r\npossessed the faculty of transfusing her own virtues into the\r\nconstitution of her daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTWO ACRES IN TRUCK--REVOLUTION IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had one acre in tomatoes, a vegetable for whose production the soil of\r\nNew Jersey is perhaps without a rival. The plants are started in\r\nhot-beds, where they flourish until all danger from frost disappears,\r\nwhen they are set out in the open air, with a generous shovel-full of\r\nwell-rotted stable manure deposited under each plant. A moist day is\r\npreferred for this operation; but even without it this plant generally\r\ngoes on growing. It has been observed that the oftener it is\r\ntransplanted, the more quickly it matures; and as the great effort among\r\ngrowers is to be first in market, so some of them take pains to give it\r\ntwo transplantings. Having no hot-bed on my premises, and my time being\r\nfully occupied with other things, I was compelled to purchase plants\r\nfrom those who had them to spare, the cost of which is elsewhere stated.\r\nBut the operation paid well.\r\n\r\nThe quantity produced by an acre of well-manured tomatoes is almost\r\nincredible. When in full bearing, the field seems to be perfectly red\r\nwith them. Those which come first into market, even without being\r\nperfectly ripe, sell for sixpence apiece. So popular has this vegetable\r\nbecome, and so great is the profit realized by cultivating it, that for\r\nnearly twenty years it has been grown in large quantities by Jerseymen\r\nwho emigrated to Virginia for the purpose of taking advantage of the\r\nearlier climate of that genial region. There they bought farms, improved\r\nthem by using freely the unappropriated and unvalued stores of manure to\r\nbe found in the vicinity, and produced whole cargoes of the choicest\r\nearly vegetables required by the great consuming public of the northern\r\ncities. They shipped them hither two weeks ahead of all the Jersey\r\ntruckers, and were rewarded by fabulous prices, from the receipt of\r\nwhich large fortunes resulted. This mutually advantageous traffic had\r\nbecome a very important one, when rebellion broke it up. Intercourse was\r\nstopped, cultivation was abandoned, and the Virginia truckers were\r\nruined.\r\n\r\nAlthough this competition seriously interfered with the profits of New\r\nJersey farmers, yet it did not destroy them. The cultivation of early\r\ntruck and fruit continued to pay, though not so well as formerly. When\r\nprices fell, the Southern growers could not afford the cost of delivery\r\nhere, and thus left us in undisputed possession of the market. But, as a\r\ngeneral rule, the Virginia competitors invariably obtained the highest\r\nprices. A great portion of their several crops, however, perished on\r\ntheir hands; because, as they had no market here when prices fell, so\r\nthe scanty population around them afforded none at home.\r\n\r\nFor the first few baskets of early tomatoes I sent to market, I obtained\r\ntwo dollars per basket of three pecks each. Other growers coming in\r\ncompetition with me, the price rapidly diminished as the supply\r\nincreased, until it fell to twenty-five cents a bushel. At less than\r\nthis the growers refused to pick them; and seasons have been repeatedly\r\nknown when tens of thousands of bushels were left to perish on the\r\nvines. When this low price could be no longer obtained, they were\r\ngathered and thrown to the pigs, who consumed them freely. But as the\r\nseason advanced the supply diminished, and the price again rose to a\r\ndollar a basket, the demand continuing as long as any could be procured.\r\nThe tomatoes are at this season picked green from the vines, and placed\r\nunder glass, where they are imperfectly ripened; but such is the public\r\nappreciation of this wholesome vegetable, that when thus only half\r\nreddened, they are eagerly sought after by hotels and boarding-houses.\r\n\r\nBut of latter years measures have been taken to prevent, to some extent,\r\nthe enormous waste of tomatoes during the height of the season, by\r\npreserving them in cans. Establishments have been started, at which any\r\nquantity that may be offered is purchased at twenty-five cents a bushel;\r\nand now they can be kept through the whole year, and be preserved for\r\nwinter consumption, the same as potatoes or turnips. By hermetically\r\nsealing them in cans from which the air has been expelled by heat, they\r\nare not only preserved, but made to retain their full flavor; and may be\r\nenjoyed, at a very moderate cost, in the winter as well as the summer.\r\nThe demand for them is constant, large, and increasing, and putting up\r\ncanned tomatoes has become an extensive business. One person, who\r\ncommenced the business two years ago, is literally up to the eyes in\r\ntomatoes once a year. He provides for a single year’s trade over fifty\r\nthousand cans, all of which are manufactured by himself; and he employs\r\nover thirty persons, most of them women. He engages tomatoes at\r\ntwenty-five cents a bushel, a price at which the cultivator clears about\r\na hundred dollars an acre, and they come in at the rate of a hundred and\r\nfifty bushels a day, requiring the constant labor of all-hands into the\r\nnight to dispose of them.\r\n\r\nThe building in which the business is carried on was constructed\r\nexpressly for it. At one end of the room in which the canning is done is\r\na range of brick-work supporting three large boilers; and adjoining is\r\nanother large boiler, in which the scalding is done. The tomatoes are\r\nfirst thrown into this scalder, and after remaining there a sufficient\r\ntime, are thrown upon a long table, on each side of which are ten or\r\ntwelve young women, who rapidly divest them of their leathery hides. The\r\npeeled tomatoes are then thrown into the boilers, where they remain\r\nuntil they are raised to a boiling heat, when they are rapidly poured\r\ninto the cans, and these are carried to the tinmen, who, with a\r\ndexterity truly marvellous, place the caps upon them, and solder them\r\ndown, when they are piled up to cool, after which they are labelled, and\r\nare ready for market. The rapidity and the system with which all this is\r\ndone is most remarkable, one of the tinmen soldering nearly a hundred\r\ncans in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe tomatoes thus preserved are readily salable in all the great cities,\r\nboth for home consumption and for use at sea. Thus, few vegetables have\r\ngained so rapid and wide-spread a popularity as this. Until lately, but\r\nfew persons would even taste them; and they were raised, when cultivated\r\nat all, more from curiosity than any thing else. Now scarcely a person\r\ncan be found who is not fond of them, and they occupy a prominent place\r\non almost every table.\r\n\r\nMy single acre of tomatoes produced me a clear profit of $120. I am\r\naware that others have realized more than double this amount, but they\r\nwere experienced hands at the business. My gains were quite as much as I\r\nhad anticipated.\r\n\r\nFrom all the remainder of the three acres but little money was produced.\r\nIt gave me parsnips, turnips, and pumpkins. Between the rows of sweet\r\ncorn a fine crop of cabbages was raised, of which my sales amounted to\r\n$82. Thus, an abundant supply of succulent food was provided for horse,\r\ncow, and pigs during the winter, all which saved the outlay of so much\r\ncash. I admit that a few of my vegetables did not yield equal to the\r\ngrounds of some of my neighbors, thus disappointing some of my\r\ncalculations. But I was inexperienced, had much to learn, and was not\r\ndiscouraged. On the other hand, I had gone far ahead of them in the\r\ngrowth of my standard fruits; and the evident hit I had made with the\r\nnew blackberry had the effect of impressing them with considerable\r\nrespect for my courage and sagacity.\r\n\r\nThis business of raising vegetables for the great city markets,\r\n“trucking,” as it is popularly called, is now the great staple of New\r\nJersey agriculture. All the region of country stretching from Camden\r\nsome forty miles towards New York, once enjoyed the reputation of being\r\neither all sand or all pine. It is traversed by the old highway between\r\nPhiladelphia and New York, laid out by direction of royalty in colonial\r\ndays, and protected at various points by barracks, in which troops were\r\ngarrisoned. Some of the barracks remain to this day; though in chambers\r\nwhere high military revel once was held, devout congregations now\r\nworship. Along this royal highway passed all the early travel between\r\nthe colonies; and after they had been severed from their parent stem, up\r\nto the advent of steamboats and railroads, it was the only thoroughfare\r\nbetween the two cities of New York and Philadelphia. Stages occupied\r\nfive weary days between them, the horses exhausted by wading through a\r\ndeep, laborious sand in summer, or the still deeper mud through which\r\nthey floundered in winter. On miles of this road the sand was frightful.\r\nNo local authorities worked it, no merciful builder of turnpikes ever\r\nthought of reclaiming it. It lay from generation to generation, as waste\r\nand wild as when the native pines were first cleared away. Access was so\r\nlaborious, that few strangers visited the region through which it\r\npassed; and the land was held in large tracts, whereon but few settlers\r\nhad made clearings. All judged the soil as worthless as the deep sand in\r\nthe highway. Where some settler did clear up a farm, his labors\r\npresented no inviting spectacle to the passing traveller. If manure was\r\nknown in those days, the farmer did not appear to value it, for he\r\nneither manufactured nor used it. Phosphates and fertilizers had not\r\nbeen dreamed of. If he spread any fertilizer over his fields, it was but\r\na starveling ration; hence his corn crop was a harvest of nubbins. Wheat\r\nhe never thought of raising; rye was the sole winter grain, and rye\r\nbread, rye mush, and rye pie-crust, held uncontested dominion, squalid\r\ncondiments as they all are, in each equally squalid farm-house. Ragweed\r\nand pigweed took alternate possession of the fields; cultivation was at\r\nits last point of attenuation; none grew rich, while all became poor;\r\nand as autumn came on, even the ordinarily thoughtless grasshopper\r\nclimbed feebly up to the abounding mullein top, and with tears in his\r\neyes surveyed the melancholy desolation around him. Such is a true\r\npicture of the king’s highway up to the building of the Camden and Amboy\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the great public who traversed it through this part of\r\nNew Jersey should think it, and speak of it everywhere, as being all\r\nsand, seeing that in their passage through it they beheld but little\r\nelse. Hence, the reputation thus early established continues to the\r\npresent day, and the tradition has been incorporated into the public\r\nvernacular. The sandy road alone was seen, while the green and fertile\r\ntracts that lay beyond and around it were unknown, because unseen. Like\r\nthe traveller from Dan to Beersheba, the cry was that all was barren.\r\nBut time, improvement, education, railroads, and the marvellous growth\r\nof Philadelphia, New York, and fifty intermediate towns, have changed\r\nall this as by enchantment. Every mile of the old highway is now a\r\nsplendid gravel turnpike, intersected by a dozen similar roads, which\r\nstretch away up into the country.\r\n\r\nAs good roads invite settlement, so population, the great promoter of\r\nthe value of land, has come in rapidly, and changed the aspect of every\r\nfarm-house. Good fences line the roadside, rank hedge-rows have\r\ndisappeared, new farm-houses have been everywhere built, low lands have\r\nbeen drained, manures have been imported from the cities, wheat is now\r\nthe staple winter-grain, rye has ceased to be cultivated, and rye bread\r\nis now a mere reminiscence of the old dispensation. But chief, perhaps,\r\nof all, the whole agricultural world of New Jersey has been educated by\r\nthe agricultural press to a high standard of intelligence and\r\nenterprise. Its labors have led to the establishment of numerous\r\nextensive nurseries, by the pressure of a general demand for trees and\r\nsmaller fruits, whose wilderness of blossoms now annually blush and\r\nbrighten upon every farm. It has taught them to cultivate new vegetables\r\nand fruits for city consumption alone, salable for cash in each\r\nsuccessive month; in doing which, they have changed from a\r\npoverty-stricken to a money-making generation. It has taught them, what\r\nnone previously believed, that no good farming can be done without high\r\nmanuring, and banished the ignorance and meanness that prevented them\r\nfrom spending money to secure it. It has introduced to their notice new\r\nand portable manures, improved tools, better breeds of stock of all\r\nkinds, and sharpened their perceptions, until they have now become men\r\nof business as well as farmers, and so proved its value to them, that\r\nhe upon whose table no agricultural journal can be found, may be written\r\ndown as the laggard of a progressive age.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to all these stimulants to progress the Camden and Amboy\r\nRailroad came in, giving it a vast momentum. Terminating at Philadelphia\r\nand New York, it opened up a cash market among thousands asking for\r\ndaily bread. When this road was first opened, its annual way-freight\r\nyielded less than one hundred dollars a year. But its managers wisely\r\nbuilt station-houses at every cross-road, as the farmers called for\r\nthem. To these nuclei the produce of entire townships quickly gathered\r\nin astonishing quantities. Agents from the great cities traversed the\r\ncountry, and bought every thing that was for sale. A cash market being\r\nbrought to their very doors, where none had previously existed, an\r\nimmense stimulus to production followed, and a new spirit was infused\r\ninto the whole region. Hundreds of farms were renovated, cleared of foul\r\nweeds, drained, and liberally manured. New vegetables were cultivated.\r\nTomatoes, peas, rhubarb, and early potatoes rose into prime staples.\r\nGreen corn has been taken from a single county to the extent of two\r\nthousand tons daily. Other products go to market by thousands of baskets\r\nat a time. Way-trains are run for the sole accommodation of this truck\r\nbusiness, stopping every few miles to take in the waiting contributions\r\ncollected at the stations. To both railroad and farmer it has proved a\r\nhighly remunerating traffic. These way-freights, thus wisely cultivated\r\nby the railroad, now amount to many thousands annually, and are\r\nsteadily growing larger. Meantime, steamboats on the Delaware stop\r\nseveral times daily at new wharves on the river, sometimes taking at one\r\ntrip two thousand baskets of truck, from a point where, twelve years\r\nago, the same number could not be gathered during an entire season. The\r\ngrower thus has the choice of the two richest markets in the country. He\r\nreaches Philadelphia in one hour, and New York in three.\r\n\r\nIt must be manifest that crops of such magnitude cannot be produced on\r\nmere sand. Hence the traditional notion that New Jersey is a sand heap,\r\ndesolate and barren at that, has long been proved to be a fallacy. Men\r\ndo not grow rich upon a burning desert, such as this region has been\r\ndescribed. Yet the farmers who occupy it are notoriously becoming so.\r\nThey lend money annually on mortgage, after spending thousands in\r\nmanure, while farms have advanced from $30 to $100 and $200 per acre.\r\nThe last ten years have added thirty per cent. to the population.\r\nSchools, churches, and towns have proportionately increased in number.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this truck region contains a large proportion of sand with\r\nloam, on which manure acts with an energetic quickness that brings all\r\nearly truck into the great markets in advance of the neighboring\r\ncountry. This secures high prices. Southern competition has only\r\nstimulated the growers to increased exertion. Though from this cause\r\nlosing some of the high rewards of former years, yet the aggregate of\r\nprofit does not seem to diminish. Better cultivation, higher manuring,\r\nchanging one product for another, with more land brought into tillage,\r\nenable them to foot up as large an amount of sales at the end of the\r\nseason as aforetime. They see that the world cannot be overfed, and that\r\nany thing they can produce will command a ready market. Consumers\r\nincrease annually, and the public appetite loses none of its rampant\r\nfierceness. Hence, competition stimulates instead of discouraging.\r\n\r\nA vast area is planted with tomatoes. Though thousands of bushels perish\r\nevery season, yet two hundred, and even four hundred dollars an acre is\r\nfrequently the clear profit. Thirty years ago, three bunches of rhubarb\r\nwere brought to the London market for sale, but as no one could be found\r\nto buy them, they were given away; yet London now consumes seven\r\nthousand tons annually. So, in New Jersey--the planter of the first half\r\nacre was pitied for his temerity. Now, there are hundreds of acres of\r\nrhubarb. The production of peas, pickles, cucumbers, melons, and\r\ncabbages is immense. Early corn is raised in vast quantities. All these\r\nvarious products command cash on delivery.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this region has long been famous for its growth of melons.\r\nFormerly they were raised by ship-loads, but Southern competition has\r\nchecked their production. Yet New Jersey citrons possess a flavor so\r\nexquisite, that they cannot be driven from the market. Peaches have long\r\nsince become almost obsolete, the yellows and the worm having been great\r\ndiscouragements. But within three years, hundreds of acres of them have\r\nbeen planted in New Jersey, and the nurseries find ready sale, in\r\nseasons of average prosperity, for all they can produce. Numerous\r\norchards will annually come into bearing; and the chances are that this\r\nonce famous staple will again be domesticated in its ancient stronghold.\r\nAmong the smaller fruits, strawberries occupy an important place in New\r\nJersey, whose soil seems peculiarly adapted to them. The yield per acre\r\nis enormous. One grower has gathered 400 bushels from three acres of the\r\nAlbany seedling. He began his plantation with a single dozen plants, at\r\n$2.50 per dozen. New York and Philadelphia took them all at an average\r\nof eighteen cents a quart. This patch was a marvel to look at. The\r\nground appeared fairly red with berries of great size, and were so\r\nabundant that pickers abandoned other fields at two cents a quart, and\r\nvolunteered to pick this at one and a half. Other neighboring growers\r\nrealized large returns. The two counties of Burlington and Monmouth are\r\nbelieved to yield more berries of all kinds than any district of equal\r\narea in the Union, and the cultivation is rapidly extending.\r\n\r\nA year or two ago, somebody invented and patented a new box for taking\r\nthem to market, lighter, neater, cheaper than the old one, and securing\r\nthorough ventilation to the fruit. A club of Connecticut men forthwith\r\norganized a company with a capital of $10,000 for manufacturing them;\r\nbuilt a factory, started an engine, and now have forty hands at work. An\r\nagent of the company went through the State last fall, from Middletown\r\nto Camden, showing samples, and taking orders. He sold three hundred\r\nthousand boxes, many to those who had the old ones, but more to others\r\njust wanting them. As he travelled on foot, with samples in his hand,\r\nhe inquired his way over the country, from farm to farm, and probably\r\ndiscovered every grower of an acre of berries. Of course he could not\r\nfail to visit and supply me. He gave me many curious items of\r\ninformation touching the extent of the berry business. There are parties\r\nin this country who have fifty acres of strawberries on a single farm,\r\nwith a thousand dollars invested merely in the small boxes in which they\r\nare taken to market. He reports that the two counties of Burlington and\r\nMonmouth produce more berries than all the remainder of the State.\r\nStrawberries and raspberries are now the staples, to which the\r\nblackberry has recently been added. The great consuming stomach of the\r\nlarge cities, having long been fed on these delicious fruits, must\r\ncontinue to buy. Growers seem to know that after thirty years’\r\npropagation of the strawberry, this devouring stomach has never been\r\nsurfeited,--that the more it is fed the more it consumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nBIRDS, AND THE SERVICES THEY RENDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning in September, hearing shots fired repeatedly at the further\r\nend of my grounds, and proceeding thither to ascertain the cause, I\r\ndiscovered three great, overgrown boobies, with guns in their hands,\r\ntrampling down my strawberries, and shooting bluebirds and robins. On\r\ninquiring where they belonged, they answered in the next township. I\r\nsuggested to them that I thought their own township was quite large\r\nenough to keep its own loafers, without sending them to depredate on me,\r\nwarned them never to show themselves on my premises again, and then\r\ndrove them out. This happened to be the only occasion on which I was\r\ninvaded by any of the worthless, loafing tribe of gunners, who roam over\r\nsome neighborhoods, engaged in the manly occupation of killing tomtits\r\nand catbirds.\r\n\r\nFor all such my aversion was as decided as my partiality for the birds\r\nwas strong. One of the little amusements I indulged in immediately on\r\ntaking possession of my farm, was to put up at least twenty little rough\r\ncontrivances about the premises, in which the birds might build. Knowing\r\ntheir value as destroyers of insects, I was determined to protect them;\r\nand thus, around the dwelling-house, in the garden-trees, and upon the\r\nsides of the barn, as well as in other places which promised to be\r\npopular, I placed boxes, calabashes, and squashes for them to occupy.\r\nThe wrens and bluebirds took to them with gratifying readiness, built,\r\nand reared their families. But I observed that the wren quickly took\r\npossession of every one in which the hole was just large enough to admit\r\nhimself, and too small to allow the bluebird to enter; while in those\r\nlarge enough to admit a bluebird no wren would build. This was because\r\nthe bluebird has a standing spite against the wrens, which leads him to\r\nenter the nests of the latter, whenever possible, and destroy their\r\neggs. Almost any number of wrens may thus be attracted round the house\r\nand garden, where they act as vigilant destroyers of insects.\r\n\r\nThese interesting creatures soon hatched out large broods of young, to\r\nprovide food for which they were incessantly on the wing. They became\r\nsurprisingly tame and familiar, those especially which were nearest the\r\nhouse, and in trees beneath which the family were constantly passing. We\r\nwatched their movements through the season with increasing interest. No\r\ncat was permitted even to approach their nests, no tree on which a\r\nfamily was domiciled was ever jarred or shaken; and the young children,\r\ninstead of regarding them as game to be frightened off, or hunted,\r\ncaught, and killed, were educated to admire and love them. Indeed, so\r\ncarefully did we observe their looks and motions, that many times I felt\r\nalmost sure that I could identify and recognize the tenants of\r\nparticular boxes. They ranged over the whole extent of my ten acres,\r\nclearing the bushes and vegetables of insects and worms; while the\r\ngarden, in which they sang and chattered from daybreak until sunset, was\r\nkept entirely clear of the destroyers. I encountered them at the\r\nfurthest extremity of my domain, peering under the peach-leaves,\r\nflitting from one tomato-vine to another, almost as tame as those at\r\nhome. They must have known me, and felt safe from harm. I am persuaded\r\nthat I recognized them. Yet it was at this class of useful birds that\r\nthe boobies calling themselves sportsmen were aiming their weapons, when\r\nI routed them from the premises, and forbid the murderous foray.\r\n\r\nInsects are, occasionally, one of the farmer’s greatest pests. But high,\r\nthorough farming is a potent destroyer. It is claimed by British writers\r\nto be a sure one. When the average produce of wheat in England was only\r\ntwenty bushels per acre, the ravages of the insect tribe were far more\r\ngeneral and destructive than they have been since the average has risen\r\nto forty bushels per acre. Why may not the cultivation of domestic birds\r\nlike these, that nestle round the house and garden, where insects mostly\r\ncongregate, be considered an important feature in any system of thorough\r\nfarming?\r\n\r\nBesides the wrens and bluebirds, the robins built under the eaves of the\r\nwood-shed, and became exceedingly tame. The more social swallow took\r\npossession of every convenient nestling-place about the barn, while\r\ntroops of little sparrows came confidingly to the kitchen door to pick\r\nup the crumbs of bread which the children scattered on the pavement as\r\nsoon as they discovered that these innocent little creatures were fond\r\nof them. Thus my premises became a sort of open aviary, in which a\r\nmultitude of birds were cultivated with assiduous care, and where they\r\nshall be even more assiduously domesticated, as long as I continue to be\r\nlord of the manor. I pity the man who can look on these things, who can\r\nlisten to the song of wrens, the loud, inspiring carol of the robin on\r\nthe tree-top, as the setting sun gilds its utmost extremities, listening\r\nto these vocal evidences of animal comfort and enjoyment, without\r\nfeeling any augmentation of his own pleasures, and that the lonesome\r\nblank which sometimes hangs around a rural residence is thus gratefully\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nOne morning, hearing a great clamor and turmoil in a thicket in the\r\ngarden, where a nest of orioles had been filled with young birds, I\r\ncautiously approached to discover the cause. A dozen orioles were\r\nhovering about in great excitement, and for some time it was impossible\r\nto discover the meaning of the trouble. But remaining perfectly quiet,\r\nso as not to increase the disturbance, I at length discovered an oriole,\r\nwhose wing had become so entangled in one end of a long string which\r\nformed part of the nest that she could not escape. The other birds had\r\nalso discovered her condition, and hence their lamentation over a\r\nmisfortune they were unable to remedy. But they did all they could, and\r\nwere assiduously bringing food to a nest full of voracious young ones,\r\nas well as feeding the imprisoned parent. I was so struck with the\r\ninteresting spectacle that my family were called out to witness it;\r\nthen, having gazed upon it a few moments, I cautiously approached the\r\nprisoner, took her in my hands, carefully untied and then cut away the\r\ntreacherous string, and let the frightened warbler go free. She\r\ninstantly flew up into her nest, as if to see that all her callow brood\r\nwere safe, gave us a song of thanks, and immediately the crowd of\r\nsympathizing birds, as if conscious that the difficulty no longer\r\nexisted, flew away to their respective nests.\r\n\r\nIt takes mankind a great while to learn the ways of Providence, and to\r\nunderstand that things are better contrived for him than he can contrive\r\nthem for himself. Of late, the people are beginning to learn that they\r\nhave mistaken the character of most of the little birds, and have not\r\nunderstood the object of the Almighty in creating them. They are the\r\nfriends of those who plant, and sow, and reap. It has been seen that\r\nthey live mostly on insects, which are among the worst enemies of the\r\nagriculturist; and that if they take now and then a grain of wheat, a\r\ngrape, a cherry, or a strawberry, they levy but a small tax for the\r\nimmense services rendered. In this altered state of things, legislatures\r\nare passing laws for the protection of little birds, and increasing the\r\npenalties to be enforced upon the bird-killers.\r\n\r\nA farmer in my neighborhood came one day to borrow a gun for the purpose\r\nof killing some yellow-birds in his field of wheat, which he said were\r\neating up the grain. I declined to loan the gun. In order, however, to\r\ngratify his curiosity, I shot one of them, opened its crop, and found in\r\nit two hundred weevils, and but four grains of wheat, and in these four\r\ngrains the weevil had burrowed! This was a most instructive lesson, and\r\nworth the life of the poor bird, valuable as it was. This bird resembles\r\nthe canary, and sings finely. One fact like this affords an eloquent\r\ntext for sermonizing, for the benefit of the farmers and others who may\r\nlook upon little birds as inimical to their interests. Every hunter and\r\nfarmer ought to know that there is hardly a bird that flies that is not\r\na friend of the farmer and gardener.\r\n\r\nSome genial spirits have given the most elaborate attention to the\r\nquestion of the value of birds. One gentleman took his position some\r\nfifteen feet from the nest of an oriole, in the top of a peach-tree, to\r\nobserve his habits. The nest contained four young ones, well fledged,\r\nwhich every now and then would stand upon the edge of the nest to try\r\ntheir wings. They were, therefore, at an age which required the largest\r\nsupply of food. This the parents furnished at intervals of two to six\r\nminutes, throughout the day. They lighted on the trees, the vines, the\r\ngrass, and other shrubbery, clinging at times to the most extreme and\r\ndelicate points of the leaves, in search of insects. Nothing seemed to\r\ncome amiss to these sharp-eyed foragers--grasshoppers, caterpillars,\r\nworms, and the smaller flies. Sometimes one, and sometimes as many as\r\nsix, were plainly fed to the young ones at once. They would also carry\r\naway the refuse litter from the nest, and drop it many yards off. A\r\nlittle figuring gives the result of this incessant warfare against the\r\ninsects. For only eight working hours it will be 1000 worms destroyed by\r\na single pair of birds. But if a hundred pairs be domesticated on the\r\npremises, the destruction will amount to 100,000 daily, or 3,000,000 a\r\nmonth!\r\n\r\nThis may seem to be a mere paper calculation, but the annals of\r\nornithology are crowded with confirmatory facts. The robin is accused of\r\nappropriating the fruit which he has protected during the growing season\r\nfrom a cloud of enemies. But his principal food is spiders, beetles,\r\ncaterpillars, worms, and larvæ. Nearly 200 larvæ have been taken from\r\nthe gizzard of a single bird. He feeds voraciously on those of the\r\ndestructive worm. In July he takes a few strawberries, cherries, and\r\npulpy fruits generally, more as a dessert than any thing else, because\r\nit is invariably found to be largely intermixed with insects. Robins\r\nkilled in the country, at a distance from gardens and fruit-trees, are\r\nfound to contain less stone-fruit than those near villages; showing that\r\nthis bird is not an extensive forager. If our choicest fruits are near\r\nat hand, he takes a small toll of them, but a small one only. In\r\nreality, a very considerable part of every crop of grain and fruit is\r\nplanted, not for the mouths of our children, but for the fly, the\r\ncurculio, and the canker-worm, or some other of these pests of\r\nhusbandry. Science has done something, and will no doubt do more, to\r\nalleviate the plague. It has already taught us not to wage equal war on\r\nthe wheat-fly and the parasite which preys upon it; and it will,\r\nperhaps, eventually persuade those who need the lesson, that a few peas\r\nand cherries are well bestowed by way of dessert on the cheerful little\r\nwarblers, who turn our gardens into concert-rooms, and do so much to aid\r\nus in the warfare against the grubs and caterpillars, which form their\r\nprincipal meal.\r\n\r\nBut if the subject of the value of insect-destroying birds has been so\r\nmuch overlooked in this country, it is not so in Europe. It has been\r\nbrought formally before the French Senate, and is now before the French\r\ngovernment. Learned commissioners have reported upon it, and it is by no\r\nmeans improbable that special legislation will presently follow. The\r\ninquiry has been conducted with an elaborate accuracy characteristic of\r\nFrench legislation. Insects and birds have been carefully classified\r\naccording to their several species; their habits of feeding have been\r\nclosely observed, and the results ascertained and computed. It has been\r\nconcluded that by no agency, save that of little birds, can the ravages\r\nof insects be kept down. There are some birds which live exclusively\r\nupon insects and grubs, and the quantity which they destroy is enormous.\r\nThere are others which live partly on grubs, and partly on grain, doing\r\nsome damage, but providing an abundant compensation. A third class--the\r\nBirds of Prey--are excepted from the category of benefactors, and are\r\npronounced, too precipitately we think, to be noxious, inasmuch as they\r\nlive mostly upon the smaller birds. One class is a match for the other.\r\nA certain insect was found to lay 2,000 eggs, but a single tom-tit was\r\nfound to eat 200,000 eggs a year. A swallow devours about 543 insects a\r\nday, eggs and all. A sparrow’s nest, in the city of Paris, was found to\r\ncontain 700 pair of the upper wings of cockchafers, though, of course,\r\nin such a place food of other kinds was procurable in abundance. It will\r\neasily be seen, therefore, what an excess of insect life is produced\r\nwhen a counterpoise like this is withdrawn; and the statistics before us\r\nshow clearly to what an extent the balance of nature has been disturbed.\r\nA third, and wholly artificial class of destroyers has been introduced.\r\nEvery _chasseur_, during the season, kills, it is said, from 100 to 200\r\nbirds daily. A single child has been known to come home at night with\r\n100 birds’ eggs, and it has been calculated and reported that the number\r\nof birds’ eggs destroyed annually in France is between 80,000,000 and\r\n100,000,000. The result is, that little birds in that country are\r\nactually dying out; some species have already disappeared, and others\r\nare rapidly diminishing. But there is another consequence. The French\r\ncrops have suffered terribly from the superabundance of insect vermin.\r\nNot only the various kinds of grain, but the vines, the olives, and even\r\nforest trees, tell the same tale of mischief, till at length the alarm\r\nhas become serious. Birds are now likely to be protected; indeed their\r\nrise in public estimation has been signally rapid. Some philosopher has\r\ndeclared, and the report quotes the saying as a profound one, that “the\r\nbirds can live without man, but man cannot live without the birds.”\r\n\r\nThe same results are being experienced in this country, and our whole\r\nagricultural press, as well as the experience of every fruit-grower and\r\ngardener, testifies to the fact that our fruit is disappearing as the\r\nbirds upon our premises are permitted to perish. Every humane and\r\nprudent man will therefore do his utmost to preserve them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCLOSE OF MY FIRST YEAR--ITS LOSS AND GAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now the dead of winter. Every thing was frozen up; but though\r\ncheerless without, it was far from being so within. My little library,\r\nwell supplied with books and the literature of the day, afforded me an\r\nintellectual banquet which never palled upon the appetite. Here my desk\r\nwas ever open; here pen, and ink, and diary were constantly at hand, for\r\nentering down my expenditures and receipts, with facts and observations\r\nfor future use. Thus conveniently provided, and all my life accustomed\r\nto accounts, I found no difficulty at the year’s end in ascertaining to\r\na dollar whether my first season’s experience had been one of loss or\r\ngain. I give the particulars in full--\r\n\r\n  Cost of stable manure and ashes                    $248.00\r\n  Plaster and guano, not all used                      20.00\r\n  Ploughing, harrowing, and digging up the garden      30.00\r\n  Cabbage and tomato plants                            30.00\r\n  Loss on my first cow                                  7.00\r\n  Garden seeds                                          8.00\r\n  Cost of six pigs                                     12.00\r\n  Corn-meal and bran                                   28.00\r\n  Dick’s wages for six months                          72.00\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                                                     $455.00\r\n\r\nHere was an outlay of $455, all of which was likely to occur every\r\nyear, except the two items of loss on cow, and cost of buying cabbages\r\nand tomato-plants, which have subsequently been raised in a hotbed at\r\nhome, without costing a dollar. The great item is in manure, amounting\r\nto $268; and this must be kept at the same figure, if not increased,\r\nunless an equal quantity can, by some process, be manufactured at home.\r\n\r\nThen there was the following permanent outlay made in stocking the farm\r\nwith fruit:\r\n\r\n  Strawberries for six acres            $120.00\r\n  Raspberries for two acres               34.00\r\n  804 Peach-trees, and planting them      72.36\r\n                                         ------\r\n                                        $226.36\r\n\r\nThis constituted a permanent investment of capital, and would not have\r\nto be repeated, so that the actual cost the first year was, as stated,\r\n$455. My own time and labor are not charged, because that item is\r\nadjusted in the grand result of whether the farm supported me or not.\r\nThere was also the cost of horse and cow, ploughs, and other tools; but\r\nthese, too, were investments, not expenses. They could be resold for\r\nmoney, no doubt, at some loss. A portion of that capital could therefore\r\nbe recovered. So, also, with the large item of $226.36 invested in\r\nstandard fruits; as, if the farm were sold its being stocked with them\r\nwould insure its bringing a higher price in consequence, probably enough\r\nto refund the capital thus invested.\r\n\r\nIt is fair, therefore, to charge the current expenses only against the\r\ncurrent receipts. The latter were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Sales of blackberry plants        $460.00\r\n      “    cabbages                   82.00\r\n      “    tomatoes                  120.00\r\n      “    garden products            80.00\r\n      “    pork                       49.00\r\n                                     ------\r\n                                    $791.00\r\n  Current expenses, as stated        455.00\r\n                                     ------\r\n                    Profit           336.00\r\n\r\nThis was about $1.25 per day for the two hundred and seventy-five days\r\nwe had been in the country, from April 1st to January 1st, and, when\r\nadded to our copious supplies of vegetables, fruit, pork, and milk, it\r\nkept the family in abundance. I proved this by a very simple formula. I\r\nknew exactly how much cash I had on hand when I began in April, and from\r\nthat amount deducted the cost of all my permanent investments in\r\nstandard fruits, stock, and implements, and found that the remainder\r\ncame within a few cents of the balance on hand in January. I did not owe\r\na dollar, and had food enough to keep my stock till spring. The season\r\nhad been a good one for me, and we felt the greatest encouragement to\r\npersevere, as the first difficulties had been overcome, and the second\r\nseason promised to be much more profitable. I considered the problem as\r\nvery nearly solved.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that no cash was received for strawberries, and herein\r\nis involved a fact important to be known and acted on by the growers of\r\nthis fruit. Most men, when planting them, say in March or April, are\r\nimpatient for a crop in June. But this should never be allowed. As soon\r\nas the blossoms appear, they should be removed. The newly transplanted\r\nvine has work enough thrown upon its roots in repairing the damage it\r\nhas suffered in being removed from one location to another, without\r\nbeing compelled, in addition, to mature a crop of fruit. To require it\r\nto do both is imposing on the roots a task they are many times unable to\r\nperform. The draft upon them by the ripening fruit is more than they can\r\nbear. I have known large fields of newly-planted vines perish in a dry\r\nseason from this cause alone. The writers on strawberry culture\r\nsometimes recommend removing the blossoms the first year, but not with\r\nsufficient urgency. I lay it down as absolutely indispensable to the\r\nestablishment of a robust growth. Thus believing, my blossoms were all\r\nclipped off with scissors; and hence, though stronger plants were thus\r\nproduced, yet there was no fruit to sell.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that my entire profit consisted of the single\r\nitem of sales of plants; hence, if there had been no demand for Lawtons,\r\nor if I had happened to have none for sale, there would have been an\r\nactual loss. My having them was a mere accident, and my luck in this\r\nrespect was quite exceptional. Unless others happen to be equally lucky,\r\nthey may set down their first year as very certain to yield no profit.\r\nWith persons as inexperienced as I was when beginning, no other result\r\nshould be expected.\r\n\r\nWinter is proverbially the farmer’s holiday. But it was no idle time\r\nwith me. I had too long been trained to habits of industry, to lounge\r\nabout the house simply because no weeds could be found to kill. The\r\ncareful man will find a world of fixing up to do for winter. As it came\r\non slowly through a gorgeous Indian summer, I set myself to cleaning up\r\nthe litter round the premises, and put the garden into the best\r\ncondition for the coming season. The verbenas had gone from the borders;\r\nthe petunias had withered on the little mound whereon their red and\r\nwhite had flashed so gayly in captivating contrast during the summer;\r\nthe delicate cypress-vine had blackened at the touch of a single frosty\r\nnight; the lady-slipper hung her flowery head; all the family of roses\r\nhad faded; the morning-glory had withered; even the hardy honeysuckle\r\nhad been frozen crisp. From the fruit-trees a cloud of leaves had fallen\r\nupon every garden-walk. Plants that needed housing were carefully\r\npotted, and taken under cover. The walks were cleared of leaves by\r\ntransferring them to the barnyard. Bushes, trees, and vines were\r\ntrimmed. Every remnant of decay was removed. The December sunshine fell\r\nupon a garden so trim and neat, that even in the bleakest day it was not\r\nunpleasant to wander through its alleys, and observe those wintry\r\nvisitants, the snow-birds, gathering from the bushes their scanty store\r\nof favorite seeds. The asparagus was covered deeply with its favorite\r\nmanure, and heavily salted. Tender roses were banked up with barnyard\r\nscrapings, and every delicate plant protected for its long season of\r\nhybernation.\r\n\r\nDick had his share of exemption from excessive labor. But I kept him\r\ntolerably busy for weeks in gathering up the cloud of leaves which fell\r\nthroughout the neighborhood from roadsides lined with trees. No manure\r\nis so well worth saving in October and November as the falling leaves.\r\nThey contain nearly three times as much nitrogen as ordinary barnyard\r\nmanure; and every gardener who has strewn and covered them in his\r\ntrenches late in the fall or in December, must have noticed the next\r\nseason how black and moist the soil is that adheres to the thrifty young\r\nbeets he pulls. No vegetable substance yields its woody fibre and\r\nbecomes soluble quicker than leaves; and, from this very cause, they are\r\nsoon dried up, scattered to the winds, and wasted, if not now gathered\r\nand trenched in, or composted, before the advent of severe winter.\r\n\r\nMy horse, and cow, and pigs, all slept in leaves. Their beds were warm\r\nand easy, and the saving of straw for litter was an item. As they were\r\nabundant, and very convenient, Dick carted to the barnyard an enormous\r\nquantity. Placing enough of them under cover, he littered all the stock\r\nwith them until spring. The remainder was composted with the contents of\r\nthe barnyard, and thus made a very important addition to my stock of\r\nmanure. Thus the leaf-harvest is one of importance to the farmer, if he\r\nwill but avail himself of it. A calm day or two spent in this business\r\nwill enable him to get together a large pile of these fallen leaves;\r\nand if stowed in a dry place, he will experience the good effects of\r\nthem in the improved condition of his stock, compared with those which\r\nare suffered to lie down, and perhaps be frozen down, in their own\r\nfilth. The fertilizing material of leaves also adds essentially to the\r\nenriching qualities of the manure-heap. Gardeners prize highly a compost\r\nmade in part of decomposed leaves. The leaf-harvest is the last harvest\r\nof the year, and should be thoroughly attended to at the proper time.\r\n\r\nThe leisure of the season gave us greater opportunity for intercourse,\r\nboth at home and abroad. The city was comparatively at our door, as\r\naccessible as ever--we were really mere suburbans. We ran down in an\r\nhour to be spectators of any unusual sight, and frequently attended the\r\nevening lectures of distinguished men. It was impossible for the world\r\nto sweep on, leaving us to stagnate. How different this winter seemed to\r\nme from any preceding one! Formerly, this long season had been one of\r\nconstant toiling; now, it was one of almost uninterrupted recreation.\r\nHow different the path I travelled from that in which ambition hurries\r\nforward--too narrow for friendship, too crooked for love, too rugged for\r\nhonesty, and too dark for science! Thus, if we choose, we may sandwich\r\nin the poetry with the prose of life. Thus, many a dainty happiness and\r\nrelishing enjoyment may come between the slices of every-day work, if we\r\nonly so determine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMY SECOND YEAR--TRENCHING THE GARDEN--STRAWBERRY PROFITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter having passed away, the time for labor and the singing of birds\r\nagain returned. Long before the land in Pennsylvania was fit to plough,\r\nthe admirable soil of New Jersey had been turned over, and planted with\r\nearly peas. One of its most valuable peculiarities is that of being at\r\nall times fit for ploughing, except when actually frozen hard. Even\r\nafter heavy rains, when denser soils require a fortnight’s drying before\r\ngetting into condition for the plough, this is ready in a day or two.\r\nIts sandy character, instead of being a disadvantage, is one of its\r\nhighest recommendations. It is thus two to three weeks earlier in\r\nyielding up its ripened products for market. Peas are the first things\r\nplanted in the open fields. The traveller coming from the north, when\r\npassing by rail to Philadelphia through this genial region, has been\r\nfrequently surprised at seeing the young pea-vines peeping up above a\r\nthin covering of snow, their long rows of delicate green stretching\r\nacross extensive fields, and presenting a singular contrast with the\r\nfleecy covering around them. Naturally hardy, they survive the cold, and\r\nas the snow rapidly disappears they immediately renew their growth.\r\n\r\nHaving been much surprised by the profit yielded last year from the\r\ngarden, I was determined to give it a better chance than ever, and to\r\ntry the effect of thorough farming on a limited scale. I accordingly set\r\nDick to covering it fully three inches deep with well-rotted\r\nstable-manure, of which I had purchased in the city my usual quantity,\r\n$200 worth, though hoping that I could so contrive it hereafter as not\r\nto be obliged to make so heavy a cash outlay for this material. I then\r\nprocured him a spade fifteen inches long in the blade, and set him to\r\ntrenching every inch of it not occupied by standard fruits. These had\r\nluckily been arranged in rows in borders by themselves, thus leaving\r\nlarge, open beds, in which the operation of trenching could be\r\nthoroughly practised. I estimated the open ground to be very nearly half\r\nan acre. I began by digging a trench from one end of the open space to\r\nthe other, three feet wide and two deep, removing the earth to the\r\nfurther side of the open space. Then the bottom of the trench was dug up\r\nwith the fifteen-inch spade, and then covered lightly with manure.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining ground was then thrown in, mixing the top soil as we went\r\nalong, and also abundance of manure, until the trench was filled. As the\r\nearth thus used was all taken from the adjoining strip of three feet\r\nwide, of course, when the trench was full, another of corresponding size\r\nappeared beside it. With this the operation was repeated until all the\r\ngarden had been thoroughly gone over. The earth which had been removed\r\nfrom the first trench, went into the last one. But I was careful not to\r\nplace the top soil in a body at the bottom, but scattered it well\r\nthrough the whole of the filling. If rich, the roots of every plant\r\nwould find some portion of it, let them travel where they might. On the\r\nwhole job we bestowed a great amount of care, but it was such a job as\r\nwould not require repeating for years, and would be permanently\r\nbeneficial. I thus deposited $50 worth of manure, as a fund of\r\nnourishment on which my vegetables could for a long time draw with\r\ncertainty of profit.\r\n\r\nNow, a surface soil of a few inches only, will not answer for a good\r\ngarden. The roots of succulent vegetables must extend into a deeper bed\r\nof fertility; and a greater depth of pulverization is required to absorb\r\nsurplus rains, and to give off the accumulated moisture in dry weather.\r\nA shallow soil will become deluged by a single shower, because the hard\r\nsubsoil will not allow it to pass downward; and again, in the heat and\r\ndrought of midsummer, a thin stratum is made dry and parched in a week,\r\nwhile one of greater depth becomes scarcely affected. I might cite\r\nnumerous instances, besides my own, where trenched gardens remained in\r\nthe finest state of luxuriance during the most severe droughts, when\r\nothers under ordinary management were nearly burnt up with the heat,\r\ngrowth having quite ceased, and leaves curled and withering for want of\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe mode of trenching must vary with circumstances. In small,\r\ncircumscribed pieces of ground, necessity requires it to be done by\r\nhand, as has been just described. In large spaces the subsoil plough\r\nmay be used, but not to equal benefit. There are many reasons why the\r\nsoils of gardens should be made better than for ordinary farm-crops.\r\nMost of the products of gardens are of a succulent nature, or will\r\notherwise bear high feeding, such as garden roots in general, plants\r\nwhose leaves furnish food, as salad, cabbages, &c., or those which\r\nproduce large and succulent fruits, as cucumbers, melons, squashes, &c.\r\nAs nearly all garden crops are the immediate food of man, while many\r\nfarm-crops are only the coarser food of animals, greater care and skill\r\nmay properly be applied in bringing the former forward to a high degree\r\nof perfection. The great amount of family supplies which may be obtained\r\nfrom a half-acre garden, provided the best soil is prepared for their\r\ngrowth, renders it a matter of equal importance and economy to give the\r\nsoil the very best preparation.\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens that there is much selection to be made in soils as we\r\nfind them in nature, for gardening purposes, unless particular attention\r\nis given to the subject in choosing a site for a new dwelling.\r\nGenerally, we have to take the land as we find it. Unless, therefore, we\r\nhappen to find it just right, we should endeavor to improve it in the\r\nbest manner. The principal means for making a perfect garden soil, are\r\ndraining, trenching, and manuring. Now, let none be startled at the\r\noutset with the fear of cost, in thus preparing the soil. The entire\r\nexpense of preparing half an acre would not, in general, amount to more\r\nthan the amount saved in a single year in the purchase of food for\r\nfamily supplies, by the fine and abundant vegetables afforded. If the\r\nowner cannot possibly prepare his half or quarter acre of land properly,\r\nthen let him occupy the ground with something else than garden crops,\r\nand take only a single square rod (if he cannot attend to more), and\r\ngive this the most perfect preparation. A square rod of rich, luxuriant\r\nvegetables, will be found more valuable than eighty rods, or half an\r\nacre of scant, dwarfed, and stringy growth, which no one will wish to\r\neat; while the extra cost and labor spent on the eighty rods in seeds,\r\ndigging, and hoeing, would have been more than sufficient to prepare the\r\nsmaller plot in the most complete manner. Let the determination be made,\r\ntherefore, at the commencement, to take no more land than can be\r\nproperly prepared, and in the most thorough manner.\r\n\r\nThe ten peach-trees in the garden were thoroughly manured by digging in\r\naround them all the coal ashes made during the winter, first sifting\r\nthem well. No stable manure was added, as it promotes too rank and\r\nwatery a growth in the peach, while ashes of any kind are what this\r\nfruit most delights in. Then the butts were examined for worms, but the\r\nlast year’s application of tar had kept off the fly, and the old ravages\r\nof the enemy were found to be nearly healed over by the growth of new\r\nbark. A fresh coating of tar was applied, and thus every thing was made\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nAs the season advanced, my wife and daughter took charge of the garden,\r\nas usual, and with high hopes of greater success than ever. They had\r\nhad one year’s experience, while now the ground was in far better\r\ncondition. Moreover, they seemed to have forgotten all about the weeds,\r\nas in calculating their prospective profits they did not mention them\r\neven once. I was careful not to do so, though I had my own suspicions on\r\nthe subject. When the planting had been done, and things went on growing\r\nfinely as the season advanced, they were suddenly reminded of their\r\nancient enemy. The trenching and manuring had done as much for the weeds\r\nas for the vegetables. Why should they not? In her innocency, Kate\r\nthought the weeds should all have been buried in the trenches, as if\r\ntheir seeds had been deposited exclusively on the surface. But they grew\r\nmore rampantly than ever during the entire season, and to my mind they\r\nseemed to be in greater quantity. But the fact worked no discouragement\r\nto either wife or daughter. They waged against them the same resolute\r\nwarfare, early, late, and in the noonday sun, until Kate, in spite of a\r\ncapacious sun-bonnet, became a nut-brown maid. Not a weed was permitted\r\nto flourish to maturity.\r\n\r\nThe careful culture of the garden this year gave them even a better\r\nreward than it had done the year before. The failures of the last season\r\nwere all avoided. Several kinds of seeds were soaked before being\r\nplanted, which prevented failure and secured a quicker growth. In\r\naddition to this, they raised a greater variety of vegetables expressly\r\nfor the store; and with some, such as radishes and beets, they were\r\nparticularly lucky, and realized high prices for all they had to dispose\r\nof. Then the high manuring and extra care bestowed upon the asparagus\r\nwere apparent in the quick and vigorous shooting up of thick and tender\r\nroots, far more than we could consume, and so superior to any others\r\nthat were taken to the store, that they sold rapidly at city prices.\r\nThus they began to make sales earlier in the season, while their crops\r\nwere far more abundant. The trenching and manuring was evidently a\r\npaying investment. In addition to all this, the season proved to be a\r\ngood one for fruit. The garden trees bore abundantly. My ten peach-trees\r\nhad by this time been rejuvenated, and were loaded with fruit. When as\r\nlarge as hickory nuts, I began the operation of removing all the\r\nsmallest, and of thinning out unsparingly wherever they were excessively\r\ncrowded. After going over five trees, I brought a bucketful of the\r\nexpurgated peaches to my wife for exhibition. She seemed panic-stricken\r\nat the sight--protested that we should have no peaches that season, if I\r\nwent on at that rate--besought me to remember my peculiar weakness for\r\npies--and pleaded so eloquently that the other trees should not be\r\nstripped, as to induce me, much against my judgment, to suspend my\r\nravages. Thus five had been thinned and five left untouched.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I regretted her interference, but as compliance with her\r\nwishes always brought to me its own gratification, if not in one way,\r\nthen in some other, so it did in this instance. In the first place, the\r\npeaches on the five denuded trees grew prodigiously larger and finer\r\nthan those on the other five. I gathered them carefully and sent them\r\nto the city, where they brought me $41 clear of expenses, while the\r\nfruit from the other trees, sent to market with similar care, netted\r\nonly $17, and those used in the family from the same trees, estimated at\r\nthe same rates, were worth $9, making, on those five, a difference of\r\n$15 in favor of thinning. Thus, the ten produced $58; but if all had\r\nbeen thinned, the product would have been $82.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected result satisfied my wife ever afterwards that it was\r\nquality, and not mere quantity, that the market wanted. Her own garden\r\nsales would have convinced her of this, had she observed them closely;\r\nbut having overlooked results there, it required an illustration too\r\nstriking to be gainsayed, and this the peach-trees furnished. All these\r\nfigures appear in Kate’s account-book. I had provided her with one\r\nexpressly for the garden operations, a nice gold pen, and every other\r\npossible convenience for making entries at the moment any transaction\r\noccurred. I had also taught her the simplest form for keeping her\r\naccounts, and caused her to keep a pass-book with the store, in which\r\nevery consignment should be entered, so that her book and the\r\nstorekeeper’s should be a check on errors that might be found in either.\r\nShe thus became extremely expert at her accounts, and as she took\r\nespecial interest in the matter, could tell from memory, at the week’s\r\nend, how many dollars’ worth of produce she had sold. I found the amount\r\nrunning up quite hopefully as the season advanced, and when it had\r\nclosed, she announced the total to be $63 without the peaches, or $121\r\nby including them. But she had paid some money for seeds; as an offset\r\nto which, no cash had been expended in digging, as Dick and myself had\r\ndone it all.\r\n\r\nSo much for the garden this year. On my nine acres of ploughed land\r\nthere was plenty of work to be done. Our old enemy, the weeds, did not\r\nseem to have diminished in number, notwithstanding our slaughter the\r\nprevious year. They came up as thick and vigorous as ever, and required\r\nquite as much labor to master them, as the hoe was oftener required\r\namong the rows of raspberries and strawberries. My dogged fellow, Dick,\r\ntook this matter with perfect unconcern--said he knew it would be so,\r\nand that I would find the weeds could not be killed--but he might as\r\nwell work among them as at any thing else. I ceased to argue with him on\r\nthe subject, and as I had full faith in coming out right in the end, was\r\ncontent to silently bide my time.\r\n\r\nThis year I planted an acre with tomatoes, having raised abundance of\r\nfine plants in a hotbed, as well as egg-plants for the garden. I set\r\nthem out in rows, three and one-half feet apart each way, and manured\r\nthem well, twice as heavily as many of my neighbors did. This gave me\r\n3,760 plants to the acre. The product was almost incredible, and\r\namounted to 501 bushels, or about five quarts a hill, a far better yield\r\nthan I had had the first year. From some hills as many as ten quarts\r\neach were gathered. I managed to get twenty baskets into New York market\r\namong the very first of the season, where they netted me $60. The next\r\ntwenty netted $25, the next twenty only $15, as numerous competitors\r\ncame in, and the next thirty cleared no more. After that the usual glut\r\ncame on, and down went the price to twenty and even fifteen cents. But\r\nat twenty and twenty-five I continued to forward to Philadelphia, where\r\nthey paid better than to let them rot on the ground. From 200 baskets at\r\nthese low prices I netted $35. Then, in the height of the season, all\r\npicking was suspended, except for the pigs, who thus had any quantity\r\nthey could consume. But the glut gradually subsided as tomatoes perished\r\non the vines, and the price again rose in market to twenty-five cents,\r\nthen to fifty, then to a dollar, and upwards. But my single acre\r\nafforded me but few at the close of the season. I did not manage to\r\nrealize $40 from the fag-end of the year, making a total net yield of\r\n$190.\r\n\r\nOthers near me, older hands at the business, did much better, but I\r\nthought this well enough. I would prefer raising tomatoes at 37 cents a\r\nbushel to potatoes at 75. The amount realized from an acre far exceeds\r\nthat of potatoes. A smart man will gather from sixty to seventy bushels\r\na day. The expense of cultivating, using plenty of manure, is about $60\r\nper acre, and the gross yield may be safely calculated $250, leaving\r\nabout $200 sure surplus. If it were not for the sudden and tremendous\r\nfall in prices to which tomatoes are subject soon after they come into\r\nmarket, growers might become rich in a few years.\r\n\r\nThe other acre was occupied with corn, roots, and cabbage, for winter\r\nfeeding, with potatoes for family use. Turnips were sowed wherever room\r\ncould be found for them, and no spot about the farm was permitted to\r\nremain idle. A hill of corn, a cabbage, a pumpkin-vine, or whatever else\r\nwas suited to it, was planted. But of potatoes we did sell enough to\r\namount to $24. On the acre occupied with blackberries, early cabbages\r\nwere planted to the number of 4,000. Many of these, of course, were\r\nsmall and not marketable, though well manured and carefully attended.\r\nBut all such were very acceptable in the barnyard and pig-pen. Of sound\r\ncabbages I sold 3,120, at an average of two and one-quarter cents,\r\namounting to $70.20. I cannot tell how it was, but other persons close\r\nto me raised larger and better heads, and of course realized better\r\nprices. But I had no reason to complain.\r\n\r\nThe strawberries came first into market. I had labored to allow no\r\nrunners to grow and take root except such as were necessary to fill up\r\nthe line of each row. Most of the others had been clipped off as fast as\r\nthey showed themselves. Thus the whole strength of the plant was\r\nconcentrated into the fruit. In other words, I set out to raise fruit,\r\nnot plants; and my rows were, therefore, composed of single stools,\r\nstanding about four to six inches apart in the row. The ground between\r\nthe rows was consequently clear for the passage of the horse-weeder,\r\nwhich kept it nice and clean throughout the season, while there was no\r\nsort of difficulty in getting between the stools with either the hand,\r\nor a small hoe, to keep out grass and weeds. The stools were\r\nconsequently strong and healthy, and stood up higher from the ground\r\nthan plants which grow in matted beds, thus measurably keeping clear of\r\nthe sand and grit which heavy rains throw up on berries that lie very\r\nnear the ground. The truth is, the ground for a foot all round each\r\nstool ought to have had a covering of cut straw, leaves, or something\r\nelse for the fruit to rest upon, thus to keep them clean, as well as to\r\npreserve them from drought. But I did not so well understand the\r\nquestion at that time as I do now.\r\n\r\nThe fruit ripened beautifully, and grew to prodigious size, larger than\r\nmost we had ever seen. The several pickings of the first week yielded\r\n600 quart boxes of the choicest fruit, which I dispatched by railroad to\r\nan agent in New York, with whom I had previously made arrangements to\r\nreceive them. The greatest care was used in preparing them for market.\r\nWhen taken from the vines they were put directly into the small boxes,\r\nand these carried to the house, where, under a large shed adjoining the\r\nkitchen, my wife and daughters had made preparations to receive them.\r\nHere they were spread out on a large pine table, and all the larger\r\nberries separated from the smaller ones, each kind being put into boxes\r\nwhich were kept separate from the other. The show made by fruit thus\r\nassorted was truly magnificent, and to the pleasure my wife experienced\r\nin handling and arranging it, she was constantly testifying. Thus 600\r\nquarts of the finest fruit we had ever beheld, were sent the first week\r\nto New York. It was, of course, nearly ten days ahead of the season in\r\nthat region--there could be no New York grown berries in market. At the\r\nweek’s end the agent remitted me $300 clear of freight and commission!\r\nThey had netted me half a dollar a quart. I confess to having been\r\ngreatly astonished and delighted--it was certainly twice as much as we\r\nhad expected. When I showed the agent’s letter to my wife, she was quite\r\namazed. Kate, who had heard a good deal of complaint about high prices,\r\nwhile we lived in the city, after reading the letter, laid it down,\r\nobserving--\r\n\r\n“I think it will not do to complain of high prices now!”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied my wife, “the tables are turned. Half a dollar a quart!\r\nHow much I pity those poor people.”\r\n\r\nAnd as she said this, I handed her a quart bowl of the luscious fruit,\r\nwhich I had been sugaring heavily while she was studying out the figures\r\nin the agent’s letter, and I feel persuaded no lover of strawberries\r\never consumed them with a more smacking relish.\r\n\r\nThe agent spoke in his letter of the admirable manner in which our\r\nberries were forwarded--all alike, all uniformly prime large fruit--not\r\nmerely big ones on top of the box as decoys, and as the prelude to\r\nfinding none but little runts at bottom. This established for us a\r\nreputation; our boxes could be guaranteed to contain prime fruit all\r\nthrough. Hence the agent could sell any quantity we could send. Indeed,\r\nit was impossible to send him too much. Thus we continued to pick over\r\nour vines from three to four times weekly. As the ripening of the fruit\r\nwent on, the sight was truly marvellous to look at. When the season was\r\nat its height, the ground seemed almost red with berries. Then the\r\nfamous doctrine of squatter sovereignty was effectually carried out on\r\nmy premises, for there were twenty girls and boys upon their knees or\r\nhams, engaged in picking berries at two cents a quart. Industrious\r\nlittle toilers they were, many of them earning from one to two dollars\r\ndaily. Some pickers were women grown, some widows, some even aged women.\r\nIt was a harvest to them also.\r\n\r\nThe small boxes were packed in chests each holding from twenty-four to\r\nsixty, just nicely filling the chest, so that there should be no\r\nrattling or shaking about, or spilling over of the fruit. The lid, when\r\nshut down and fastened, held all snug. These chests were taken to the\r\nrailroad station close by, the same afternoon the berries were picked,\r\nand reached New York the same night. The agents knowing they were\r\ncoming, had them all sold before they arrived, and immediately\r\ndelivering them to the purchasers, they in turn delivered to their\r\ncustomers, and thus in less than twenty-four hours from the time of\r\nleaving my ground, they were in the hands of the consumers. This whole\r\nbusiness of conveying fruit to distant markets by steamboat and rail, is\r\nthoroughly systematized. It is an immense item in the general\r\nfreight-list of the great seaboard railroads, constantly growing, and as\r\nsurely enriching both grower and carrier. For the former it insures a\r\nsale of all his products in the highest markets, and in fact brings them\r\nto his very door.\r\n\r\nBefore the building of the Camden and Amboy Railroad no such facilities\r\nexisted, and consequently not a tenth of the fruit and truck now raised\r\nin New Jersey was then produced. But an outlet being thus established,\r\nproduction commenced. Farms were manured, their yield increased, and\r\nstations for the receipt of freight were built at every few miles along\r\nthe railroad. They continue to increase in number up to this day. Lands\r\nrose in value, better fences were supplied, new houses built, and the\r\nwhole system of county roads was revolutionized. As every thing that\r\ncould be raised now found a cash market, so every convenience for\r\ngetting it there was attended to. Hence, gravel turnpikes were built,\r\nwhich, stretching back into the country, enabled growers at all seasons\r\nto transport their products over smooth roads to the nearest station.\r\nThese numerous feeders to the great railroad caused the income from\r\nway-traffic to increase enormously. All interests were signally\r\nbenefited, and a new career of improvement for New Jersey was\r\ninaugurated. The farmers became rich on lands which for generations had\r\nkept their former owners poor.\r\n\r\nMy agents were punctual in advising me by the first mail, and sometimes\r\nby telegraph, of the sale and price of each consignment, thus keeping me\r\nconstantly posted up as to the condition of the market. They paid the\r\nfreight on each consignment, deducted it from the proceeds, and returned\r\nthe chests, though sometimes with a few small boxes missing, a loss to\r\nwhich growers seem to be regularly subjected, so long as they use a box\r\nwhich they cannot afford to give away with the fruit. I thus fed the\r\nnorthern cities as long as the price was maintained. But, as is the case\r\nwith all market produce, prices gradually declined as other growers came\r\nin, for all hands sought to sell in the best market. As the end of the\r\nseason is generally a period of very low prices, it must be counteracted\r\nby every effort to secure high ones at the beginning, in this way\r\nmaintaining a remunerative average during the whole. Thus, the half\r\ndollar per quart which I obtained for the first and best, by\r\nequalization with lower prices through the remainder of the season, was\r\nunable to raise the average of the whole crop above sixteen cents net.\r\nBut this abundantly satisfied me, as I sent to market 5,360 quarts, thus\r\nproducing $857.60.\r\n\r\nBesides these, we had the satisfaction of making generous presents to\r\nsome particular friends in the city, while at home we rioted upon them\r\ndaily, and laid by an extraordinary quantity in the shape of preserves\r\nfor winter use, a luxury which we had never indulged in during our\r\nresidence in the city. I may add that during the whole strawberry season\r\nit was observed that our city friends seemed to take an extraordinary\r\ninterest in our proceedings and success. They came up to see us even\r\nmore numerously than during the dog-days, and no great effort was\r\nrequired, no second invitation necessary, to induce them to prolong\r\ntheir visits. But we considered them entirely excusable, as the\r\nstrawberries and cream were not only unexceptionable, but abundant.\r\nHowever, I must confess, that in the busiest part of the season our\r\nfemale visitors rolled up their sleeves, and fell to with my wife and\r\ndaughters for hours at a time, aiding them in assorting and boxing the\r\nhuge quantities of noble fruit as it came in from the field.\r\n\r\nIn order to send this fruit to market, I was obliged to purchase 3,000\r\nquart boxes, and 50 chests to contain them. These cost me $200. I could\r\nnot fill all the boxes at each picking, but as one set of boxes was away\r\noff in market, it was necessary for me to have duplicates on hand, in\r\nwhich to pick other berries as they ripened, without being compelled to\r\nwait until the first lot of boxes came back. Sometimes it was a week or\r\nten days before they were returned to me, according as the agent was\r\nprompt or dilatory. Thus, one supply of boxes filled with fruit was\r\nconstantly going forward, while another of empty ones was on the way\r\nback. So extensive has this berry business become, that I could name\r\nparties who have as much as $500 to $1,500 invested in chests and boxes\r\nfor the transportation of fruit to market. But their profits are in\r\nproportion to the extent of their investment.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject of boxes for the transportation of fruit to\r\ndistant markets, a suggestion occurs to me which some ingenious man may\r\nbe able to work up into profitable use. It is sometimes quite a trouble\r\nfor the grower to get his chests returned at the proper time. Sometimes\r\nthe agent is careless and inattentive, keeps them twice as many days as\r\nhe ought to, when the owner really needs them. Sometimes an accident on\r\nthe railroad delays their return for a week or ten days. In either case,\r\nthe grower is subjected to great inconvenience; and if his chests fail\r\nto return at all, his ripened fruit will perish on his hands for want of\r\nboxes in which to send them off. It is to be always safe from these\r\ncontingencies that he finds it necessary to keep so large a quantity on\r\nhand. Then, many of the boxes are never returned, the chests coming back\r\nonly half or quarter filled. All this is very unjustly made the grower’s\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nBut a remedy for this evil can and ought to be provided. The trade needs\r\nfor its use a box so cheap that it can afford to give it away. Then,\r\nbeing packed in rough, open crates, cheaply put together of common lath,\r\nwith latticed sides, neither crates nor boxes need be returned. The\r\ngrower will save the return-freight, and be in no danger of ever being\r\nshort of boxes by the negligence of others. This is really a very urgent\r\nwant of the trade. The agent sells by wholesale to the retailer, who\r\ntakes the chest to his stand or store, where he sells the contents, one\r\nor more boxes to each customer. These sometimes have no baskets with\r\nthem in which to empty the berries, and so the retailer, to insure a\r\nsale, permits the buyer to carry off the boxes, and the latter neglects\r\nto return them. In the same way they are sent to hotels and\r\nboarding-houses, where they are lost by hundreds. Again, the obligation\r\nimposed on a buyer to return the boxes to a retailer, is constantly\r\npreventing hundreds of chance purchasers of rare fruit from taking it;\r\nbut if the seller could say to him that the box goes with the fruit, and\r\nneed not be returned, the mere convenience of the thing would be\r\nsufficient to determine the sale of large quantities,--the purchaser\r\nwould carry it home in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe maker of a cheap box like this would find the sale almost\r\nindefinite. It would be constant, and annually increasing. The same\r\nbuyers would require fresh supplies every season. A mere chip box,\r\nrounded out of a single shaving, and just stiff enough to prevent the\r\nsides from collapsing, would answer every purpose. The pill-boxes which\r\nare made from shavings may serve as the model. Here is a great and\r\ngrowing want, which our countrymen are abundantly able to supply, and to\r\nwhich some of them cannot too soon direct their attention. If the cost\r\nof transmitting the boxes to the buyers be too great for so cheap a\r\ncontrivance, then let the shavings be manufactured of the exact size\r\nrequired, and delivered in a flat state to the buyer, with the circular\r\nbottom, by him to be put together during the leisure days of winter. A\r\nsingle touch of glue will hold the shaving in position, and a couple of\r\ntacks will keep the bottom in its place. The whole affair being for\r\ntemporary use, need be nothing more than temporary itself. A portion of\r\nthe labor of manufacturing being done by the grower, will reduce the\r\ncost. If constructed as suggested, such boxes would be quite as neat as\r\nthe majority now in use, while they would possess the charm of always\r\nbeing clean and sweet. Our country is at this moment full of machinery\r\nexactly fitted to produce them, much of it located in regions where\r\ntimber and power are obtainable at the minimum cost. The suggestion\r\nshould be appropriated by its owners at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES--THE LAWTONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo strawberries succeeded raspberries. My stock of boxes was thus useful\r\na second time. But raspberries are not always reliable for a full crop\r\nthe first season after planting, and so it turned out with mine. They\r\nbore only moderately; but by exercising the same care in rejecting all\r\ninferior specimens, the first commanded twenty-five cents a quart in\r\nmarket; gradually declining to twelve, below which none were sold. I\r\nmarketed only 242 quarts from the whole, netting an average of 16 cents\r\na quart, or $38.72. In price they were thus equal to strawberries. In\r\naddition to this, we consumed in the family as much as all desired, and\r\nthat was not small. I had heard of others doing considerably better than\r\nthis, but had no disposition to be dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe trade in raspberries is increasing rapidly in the neighborhood of\r\nall our large cities, stimulated by the establishment of steamboats and\r\nrailroads, on which they go so quickly and cheaply to market. It is\r\nprobably greater in New York State than elsewhere. The citizens of\r\nMarlborough, in Ulster county, have a steamboat regularly employed for\r\nalmost the sole business of transporting their raspberries to New York.\r\nIn a single season their sales of this fruit amount to nearly $90,000.\r\nThe demand is inexhaustible, and the cultivation consequently\r\nincreases. In the immediate vicinity of Milton, in the same county,\r\nthere are over 100 acres of them, and new plantations are being annually\r\nestablished. The pickers are on the ground as soon as the dew is off, as\r\nthe berries do not keep so well when gathered wet. I have there seen\r\nfifty pickers at work at the same time, men, women, and children, some\r\nof them astonishingly expert, earning as much as $2 in a day. Several\r\npersons were constantly employed in packing the neat little baskets into\r\ncrates, the baskets holding nearly a pint. By six o’clock the crates\r\nwere put on board the steamboat, and by sunrise next morning they were\r\nin Washington market. As many as 80,000 baskets are carried at a single\r\ntrip. The retail price averages ten cents a basket, one boat thus\r\ncarrying $800 worth in a single day. All this cultivation being\r\nconducted in a large way, the yield per acre is consequently less than\r\nfrom small patches thoroughly attended to. There are repeated instances\r\nof $400 and even $600 being made clear from a single acre of\r\nraspberries.\r\n\r\nThe culture in Ulster county, though at first view appearing small, yet\r\ngives employment to, and distributes its gains among thousands of\r\npersons. The mere culture requires the services of a large number of\r\npeople. The pickers there, as well as in New Jersey, constitute a small\r\narmy, there being five or more required for each acre, and the moneys\r\nthus earned by these industrious people go far towards making entire\r\nfamilies comfortable during some months of the year. The season for\r\nraspberries continues about six weeks. Many of the baskets which are\r\nused about New York are imported from France. Frequently the supply is\r\nunequal to the demand. If the chip boxes were introduced, as suggested\r\nin the last chapter, the whole of this outlay to foreign countries could\r\nbe stopped. It is strange, indeed, that any portion of our people should\r\nbe compelled to depend on France for baskets in which to convey their\r\nberries to market.\r\n\r\nAs my raspberries disappeared, so in regular succession came the Lawton\r\nblackberries. I had cut off the tip of every cane the preceding July.\r\nThis, by stopping the upward growth, drove the whole energy of the plant\r\ninto the formation of branches. These had in turn been shortened to a\r\nfoot in length at the close of last season. This process, by limiting\r\nthe quantity of fruit to be produced, increased the size of the berries.\r\nI am certain of this fact, by long experience with this plant. It also\r\nprevented the ends of the branches resting on the ground, when all fruit\r\nthere produced would otherwise be ruined by being covered with dust or\r\nmud. Besides, this was their first bearing year, and as they had not had\r\ntime to acquire a full supply of roots, it would be unwise to let them\r\noverbear themselves. Some few which had grown to a great height were\r\nstaked up with pickets four and a half feet long, and tied, the pickets\r\ncosting $11 per thousand at the lumber-yard. But the majority did not\r\nneed this staking up the first season; but many of the canes sent up\r\nthis year, for bearers the next, it was necessary to support with\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\nThe crop was excellent in quality, but not large. I began picking July\r\n20, and thus had the third use of my stock of boxes. I practised the\r\nsame care in assorting these berries for market which had been observed\r\nwith the others, keeping the larger ones separate from the smaller ones.\r\nThus a chest of the selected berries, when exposed to view, presented a\r\ntruly magnificent sight. Up to this time they had never been seen by\r\nfifty frequenters of the Philadelphia markets. But when this rare\r\ndisplay was first opened in two of the principal markets, it produced a\r\ngreat sensation. None had been picked until perfectly ripe, hence the\r\nrare and melting flavor peculiar to the Lawton pervaded every berry.\r\nThey sold rapidly and netted me thirty cents a quart, the smaller ones\r\ntwenty-five cents. There appeared to be no limit to the demand at these\r\nprices. Buyers cheerfully gave them, though they could get the common\r\nwild blackberry in the same market at ten cents. Now, it cost me no more\r\nto raise the Lawtons than it would have done to raise the common\r\narticle. But this is merely another illustration of the folly of raising\r\nthe poorest fruit to sell at the lowest prices, instead of the best to\r\nsell at the highest.\r\n\r\nThe crop of Lawtons amounted to five hundred and ninety-two quarts, and\r\nnetted me $159.84, an average of twenty-seven cents a quart. My family\r\ndid not fail to eat even more than a usual allowance. As soon as the\r\npicking was done, while the plants were yet covered with leaves, Dick\r\ncut off at the ground all the canes which had just fruited, using a\r\nstrong pair of snip-shears, which cut them through without any labor.\r\nThese canes having done their duty would die in the autumn, could now\r\nbe more easily cut than when grown hard after death, and if removed at\r\nonce, would be out of the way of the new canes of this year’s growth.\r\n\r\nThe latter could then be trimmed and staked up for the coming year, the\r\nremoval of all which superfluous foliage would let in the sun and air\r\nmore freely to the cabbages between the rows. The old wood being thus\r\ncut out, was gathered in a heap, and when dry enough was burned, the\r\nashes being collected and scattered around the peach-trees. After this\r\nthe limbs were all shortened in to a foot. They were very strong and\r\nvigorous, as in July the tops of the canes had all been taken off,\r\nleaving no cane more than four feet high. The branches were consequently\r\nvery strong, giving promise of a fine crop another season. After this,\r\nsuch as needed it were staked up and tied, as the autumn and winter\r\nwinds so blow and twist them about that otherwise they would be broken\r\noff. But subsequent practice has induced me to cut down to only three\r\nfeet high; and this being done in July, when the plant is in full\r\ngrowth, the cane becomes so stiff and stocky before losing its leaves as\r\nto require no staking, and will support itself under any ordinary storm.\r\nI have seen growers of this fruit who neglected for two or three years,\r\neither from laziness or carelessness, to remove the old wood; but it\r\nmade terrible work for the pickers, as in order to get at one year’s\r\nfruit they were compelled to contend with three years’ briers. Only a\r\nsloven will thus fail to remove the old wood annually. I prefer removing\r\nit in the autumn, as soon as picking is over, for reasons above given,\r\nand also because at that time there is less to do than in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the fame of the Lawton blackberry had greatly extended\r\nand the demand increased, but the propagation had also been stimulated.\r\nA class of growers had omitted tilling their grounds, so as to promote\r\nthe growth of suckers, caring more for the sale of plants than for that\r\nof fruit. Hence the quantity to meet the demand was so large as to\r\nreduce the price, but I sold of this year’s growth enough plants to\r\nproduce me $213.50. Of this I laid out $54 in marl, which I devoted\r\nexclusively to the blackberries. I had been advised by a friend that\r\nmarl was the specific manure for this plant, as of his own knowledge he\r\nknew it to be so. A half-peck was spread round each hill, and the\r\nremainder scattered over the ground. A single row was left unmarled. It\r\nshowed the power of this fertilizer the next season, as the rows thus\r\nmanured were surprisingly better filled with fruit than that which\r\nreceived none. Since that I have continued to use this fertilizer on my\r\nblackberries, and can from experience recommend its use to all who may\r\ncultivate them.\r\n\r\nWith the sale of pork, amounting to $58, the receipts of my second year\r\nterminated. My cash-book showed the following as the total of receipts\r\nand expenditures:\r\n\r\n  Paid for stable manure                       $200.00\r\n  Ashes, and Baugh’s rawbone superphosphate      92.00\r\n  Marl                                           54.00\r\n  Dick’s wages                                  144.00\r\n  Occasional help                                94.00\r\n  Feed for stock                                 79.30\r\n  Pigs bought                                    12.00\r\n  Garden and other seeds                         13.00\r\n  Lumber, nails, and sundries                    14.50\r\n  Stakes and twine                                7.00\r\n                                                ------\r\n                                               $709.80\r\n\r\nThe credit side of the account was much better than last year, and was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  From strawberries, 6 acres               $857.60\r\n    “  Lawton blackberries, 1 acre          159.84\r\n    “  Lawton plants                        213.50\r\n    “  raspberries, 2 acres                  38.72\r\n    “  tomatoes, 1 acre                     190.00\r\n    “  cabbages                              70.20\r\n    “  garden                                63.00\r\n    “  peaches, 10 trees in garden           58.00\r\n    “  potatoes                              24.00\r\n    “  pork                                  58.00\r\n    “  calf                                   2.00\r\n                                         ---------\r\n                                         $1,734.86\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to bear in mind that in addition to this cash\r\nreceipt towards the support of a family, we had not laid out a dollar\r\nfor fruits or vegetables during the entire year. Having all of them in\r\nunstinted abundance, with a most noble cow, the cash outlay for the\r\nfamily was necessarily very small; for no one knows, until he has all\r\nthese things without paying for them in money, how very far they go\r\ntowards making up the sum total of the cost of keeping a family of ten\r\npersons. In addition to this, we had a full six months’ supply of pork\r\non hand.\r\n\r\nThe reader will also be struck with the enormous difference in favor of\r\nthe second year. But on dissecting the two accounts he will see good\r\nreason for this difference. In the first place, some improvement was\r\nnatural, as the result of my increase of knowledge,--I was expected to\r\nbe all the time growing wiser in my new calling. In the second place,\r\nsome expenses incident to the initiatory year were lopped off; and\r\nthird, three of my standard fruits had come into bearing. The increase\r\nof receipts was apparently sudden, but it was exactly what was to be\r\nexpected. I used manure more freely, and on my acre of clover was\r\nparticular to spread a good dressing of solid or liquid manure\r\nimmediately after each mowing, so as to thus restore to it a full\r\nequivalent for the food taken away. This dressing was sometimes ashes,\r\nsometimes plaster, or bone-phosphate, or liquid, and in the fall a good\r\ntopping from the barnyard. In return for this, the yield of clover was\r\nprobably four times what it would have been had the lot been pastured\r\nand left unmanured. In fact, it became evident to me that the more\r\nmanure I was able to apply on any crop, the more satisfactory were my\r\nreturns. Hence, the soiling system was persevered in, and we had now\r\nbecome so accustomed to it that we considered it as no extra trouble.\r\n\r\nThe result of this year’s operations was apparently conclusive. My\r\nexpenses for the farm had been $709.80, while my receipts had been\r\n$1,734.86, leaving a surplus of $1,025.06 for the support of my family.\r\nBut more than half of their support had been drawn from the products of\r\nthe farm; and, at the year’s end, when every account had been settled\r\nup, and every bill at the stores paid off, I found that of this\r\n$1,025.06 I had $567 in cash on hand,--proving that it had required only\r\n$458.06 in money, in addition to what we consumed from the farm, to keep\r\nus all with far more comfort than we had ever known in the city. Thus,\r\nafter setting aside $356.06 for the purchase of manure, there was a\r\nclear surplus of $200 for investment.\r\n\r\nI had never done better than this in the city. There, the year’s end\r\nnever found me with accounts squared up, and a clear cash balance on\r\nhand. Few occupations can be carried on in the city after so snug a\r\nfashion. Credit is there the rule, and cash the exception,--at least it\r\nwas ten years ago. But in the apparently humbler trade of trucking and\r\nfruit-growing every thing is cash. Manure, the great staple article to\r\nbe bought, can be had on credit; but all you grow from it is cash. Food\r\nmust be paid for on delivery, and he who produces it will have no bad\r\ndebts at the year’s end but such as may exist from his own carelessness\r\nor neglect. Thus, what a farmer earns he gets. He loses none of his\r\ngains, if he attends to his business. They may be smaller, on paper,\r\nthan those realized by dashing operators in the city, but they are\r\ninfinitely more tangible; and if, as in my case, they should prove to be\r\nenough, what matters it as to the amount? The producers of food,\r\ntherefore, possess this preponderating advantage over all other classes\r\nof business men: they go into a market where cash without limit is\r\nalways ready to be paid down for whatever they bring to it. A business\r\nwhich is notoriously profitable, thus kept up at the cash level, and\r\nconsequently free from the hazard of bad debts, cannot fail to enrich\r\nthose who pursue it extensively, and with proper intelligence and\r\nindustry. I could name various men who, beginning on less than a hundred\r\ndollars, and on rented land, have in a few years become its owners, and\r\nin the end arrived at great wealth, solely from the business of raising\r\nfruit and truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLIQUID MANURES--AN ILLUSTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the autumn of my second year fairly set in, and the leaves\r\nfallen, than I turned my attention more closely than ever to the subject\r\nof providing an abundant supply of manure, in hopes of being able to\r\ndevise some plan by which to lessen the large cash outlay necessary to\r\nbe annually made for it. I did not grudge the money for manure, any more\r\nthan the sugar on my strawberries. Both were absolutely necessary; but\r\neconomy in providing manure was as legitimate a method of increasing my\r\nprofits as that of purchasing it. I knew it must be had in abundance:\r\nthe point was, to increase the quantity while diminishing the outlay.\r\nThus resolved, I kept Dick more actively at work than ever in gathering\r\nleaves all over the neighborhood, and when he had cleaned up the public\r\nroads, I then sent him into every piece of woods to which the owner\r\nwould grant me access. In these he gathered the mould and half-rotted\r\nleaves which thickly covered the ground. I knew that he would thus bring\r\nhome a quantity of pestiferous seeds, to plague us in the shape of\r\nweeds, but by this time we had learned to have no fear of them. By\r\nsteadily pursuing this plan when no snow lay on the ground, he piled up\r\nin the barnyard a most astonishing quantity of leaves. There happened to\r\nbe but little competition in the search for them, so that he had the\r\nground clear for himself. All this addition to the manure heap cost me\r\nnothing. To this I added many hogsheads of bones, which the small boys\r\nof the neighborhood gathered up from pig-pens, slaughter-houses, and\r\nother places, and considered themselves well paid at ten cents a bushel\r\nfor their labor. These were laid aside until the best and cheapest\r\nmethod could be devised for reducing them to powder, and so fitting them\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I frequently walked for miles away into the country,\r\nmaking acquaintance with the farmers, observing their different modes of\r\ncultivation, what crops they produced, and especially their methods of\r\nobtaining manures. As before observed, farmers have no secrets. Hence\r\nmany valuable hints were obtained and treasured up, from which I have\r\nsubsequently derived the greatest advantage. Some of these farmers were\r\nliving on land which they had skinned into the most squalid poverty, and\r\nwere on the high-road to being turned off by the sheriff. Others were\r\nmanured at a money cost which astonished me, exceeding any outlay that I\r\nhad made, but confirming to the letter all my preconceived opinions on\r\nthe subject, that one acre thoroughly manured is worth ten that are\r\nstarved. Of one farmer I learned particulars as to the history of his\r\nneighbor, which I felt a delicacy in asking of the latter himself. Some\r\ninstances of success from the humblest beginnings were truly\r\nremarkable; but in all these I found that faith in manure lay at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nOne case is too striking to be omitted. A German, with his wife, and two\r\nchildren just large enough to pull weeds and drive a cow, had settled,\r\nseven years before, on eight acres, from which the owner had been driven\r\nby running deeply in debt at the grog-shop. The drunkard’s acres had of\r\ncourse become starved and desolate; the fences were half down, there was\r\nno garden, and the hovel, in which his unhappy family was once snugly\r\nhoused, appeared ready to take its departure on the wings of the wind.\r\nEvery fruit-tree had died. In this squalid condition the newly arrived\r\nGerman took possession, with the privilege of purchasing for $600. His\r\nwhole capital was three dollars. He began with four pigs, which he paid\r\nfor in work. The manure from these was daily emptied into an empty\r\nbutter-firkin, which also served as a family water-closet, and the whole\r\nwas converted into liquid manure, which was supplied to cabbages and\r\nonions. A gentleman who lived near, and who noted the progress of this\r\nindustrious man, assured me that even in the exhausted soil where the\r\ncrops were planted, the growth was almost incredible. On turnips and\r\nruta-bagas the effect was equally great. Long before winter set in, this\r\nhero had bought a cow, for while his own crops were growing he had\r\nearned money by working around the neighborhood. He readily obtained\r\ncredit at the store, for he was soon discovered to be deserving. When\r\naway at work, his wife plied the hoe, and acted as mistress of the\r\naforesaid butter-tub, while the children pulled weeds. His cabbages and\r\nroots exceeded any in the township; they discharged his little\r\nstore-bills, and kept his cow during the winter, while the living cow\r\nand the dead pigs kept the entire family, for they lived about as close\r\nto the wind as possible.\r\n\r\nThis man’s passion was for liquid manure. If he had done so much with a\r\ntub, he was of course comparatively rich with a cow. Then he sunk a\r\nhogshead in the ground, conducted the wash of the kitchen into it, and\r\nthere also emptied the droppings from the cow. It was water-closet for\r\nher as well as for the family. It is true that few of us would fancy\r\nsuch a smelling-bottle at the kitchen door; but it never became a\r\nnuisance, for he kept it innoxious by frequent applications of plaster,\r\nwhich improved as well as purified the whole contents. It was laborious\r\nto transport the fluid to his crops, but a wheelbarrow came the second\r\nyear to lessen the labor. There happened, by the merest accident, to be\r\na quarter of an acre of raspberries surviving on the place. He dug all\r\nround these to the depth of eighteen inches, trimmed them up, kept out\r\nthe weeds, and gave them enormous quantities of liquid manure. The yield\r\nwas most extraordinary, for the second year of his location there he\r\nsold $84 worth of fruit. This encouraged him to plant more, until at the\r\nend of four years he had made enough, from his raspberries alone, not\r\nonly to pay for his eight acres, but to accumulate a multitude of\r\ncomforts around him. In all this application of liquid manure his wife\r\nhad aided him with unflagging industry.\r\n\r\nIt was natural for me to feel great interest in a case like this, so I\r\ncalled repeatedly to see the grounds and converse with the German owner.\r\nAs it was seven years from his beginning when I first became acquainted\r\nwith him, his little farm bore no resemblance to its condition when he\r\ntook possession. There were signs of thrift all over it. His fences were\r\nnew, and clear of hedge-rows; his house had been completely renovated;\r\nhe had built a large barn and cattle-sheds, while his garden was\r\nimmeasurably better than mine. Every thing was in a condition exceeding\r\nall that I had seen elsewhere. His two girls had grown up into handsome\r\nyoung women, and had been for years at school. All this time he had\r\ncontinued to enlarge his means of manufacturing and applying liquid\r\nmanure, as upon its use he placed his main dependence. He had sunk a\r\nlarge brick cistern in the barnyard, into which all the liquor from six\r\ncows and two horses was conducted, as well as the wash from the pig-pen\r\nand the barnyard. A fine pump in the cistern enabled him to keep his\r\nmanure heap constantly saturated, the heap being always under cover, and\r\nto fill a hogshead mounted on wheels, from which he discharged the\r\ncontents over his ground. The tub and underground hogshead with which he\r\ncommenced were of course obsolete. If it be possible to build a monument\r\nout of liquid manure, here was one on this farm of eight acres. Its\r\nowner developed another peculiarity--he had no desire to buy more land.\r\n\r\nThis man’s great success in a small way could not have been achieved\r\nwithout the most assiduous husbanding of manure, and this husbanding\r\nwas accomplished by soiling his cow. As he increased his herd he\r\ncontinued the soiling system; but as it required more help, so he\r\nabandoned working for others and hired whatever help was necessary. The\r\nincrease of his manure heap was so great that his little farm was soon\r\nbrought into the highest possible condition. In favorable seasons he\r\ncould grow huge crops of whatever he planted. But his progress was no\r\ngreater than has repeatedly been made by others, who thoroughly\r\nprosecute the soiling system.\r\n\r\nA frequent study of this remarkable instance of successful industry, led\r\nme to conclude that high farming must consist in the abundant use of\r\nmanure in a liquid state. A fresh reading of forgotten pages shed\r\nabundance of new light upon the subject. The fluid excretia of every\r\nanimal is worth more than the solid portion; but some are not contented\r\nwith losing the fluid portions voided by the animals themselves, but\r\nthey suffer the solid portions of their manure to undergo destructive\r\nfermentation in their barnyards, and thus to become soluble, and part,\r\nby washing, with the more valuable portions. Now it is well known that\r\nthe inorganic matter in barnyard manure is always of a superior\r\ncharacter, therefore valuable as well as soluble; and this is regularly\r\nparted with from the soil by those who permit the washings to be wasted\r\nby running off to other fields or to the roadside. I have seen whole\r\ntownships where every barnyard on the roadside may be found discharging\r\na broad stream of this life-blood of the farm into the public highway.\r\nThe manure heap must be liquefied before the roots of plants can be\r\nbenefited by the food it contains. No portion of a straw decomposed in\r\nthe soil can feed a new plant until it is capable of being dissolved in\r\nwater; and this solution cannot occur without chemical changes, whose\r\nconditions are supplied by the surroundings. Such changes can be made to\r\noccur in the barnyard by saturating the compost heap with barnyard\r\nliquor. All that nature’s laws would in ten years effect in manures in\r\nan ordinary state, when ploughed into the ground, are ready, and occur\r\nin a single season, when the manures are presented to the roots of\r\nplants in a liquid form.\r\n\r\nA suggestion appropriate to this matter may be made for the\r\nconsideration of ingenious minds. Every farmer knows that a manure heap,\r\nwhen first composted, abounds in clods of matted ingredients so compact,\r\nthat time alone will thoroughly reduce them to that state of\r\npulverization in which manure becomes an available stimulant to the\r\nroots of plants. Fermentation, the result of composting or turning over\r\na manure heap, does measurably destroy their cohesion, but not\r\nsufficiently. Few can afford to let their compost heaps remain long\r\nenough for the process of pulverization to become as perfect as it\r\nshould be. Hence it is taken to the field still composed of hard clods,\r\naround which the roots may instinctively cluster, but into which they\r\nvainly seek to penetrate. Some careful farmers endeavor to remedy this\r\ndefect by laboriously spading down the heap as it is carted away. The\r\noperation is a slow one, and does not half prepare the manure for\r\ndistribution. A year or two is thus required for these clods to become\r\nproperly pulverized, for they remain in the soil inert and useless until\r\nsubsequent ploughings and harrowing reduce them to powder.\r\n\r\nAs farmers cannot wait for time to perform this office in the manure\r\nheap, they should have machinery to do the work. A wooden cylinder,\r\narmed with long iron teeth, and revolving rapidly in a horizontal\r\nposition, with the manure fed in at the top through a capacious hopper,\r\nwould tear up the clods into tatters, and deliver the whole in the exact\r\ncondition of fine powder, which the roots of all plants require. To do\r\nthis would require less time and labor than the present custom of\r\ncutting down with either spade or drag. Better still, if the manure\r\ncould be so broken up as it is taken from the barnyard to the compost\r\nheap; the process of disintegration thus begun would go on through the\r\nentire mass, until, when carted away, it would be found almost as\r\nfriable as an ash heap. It is by contact of the countless mouths of the\r\nroots with minute particles of manure that they suck up nutriment, not\r\nby contact with a dense clod. Hence the astonishing and immediate\r\nefficacy of liquid manure. In that the nutriment has been reduced to its\r\nutmost condition of divisibility, and when the liquid is applied to the\r\nsoil, saturation reaches the entire root, embracing its marvellous\r\nnetwork of minute fibres, and affording to each the food which it may be\r\nseeking.\r\n\r\nWe cannot use liquid manures on a large scale, but thorough\r\npulverization of that which is solid is a very near approach to the\r\nformer. Immerse a compact clod in water, and the latter will require\r\ntime to become discolored. But plunge an equal bulk of finely pulverized\r\nmanure into water, and discoloration almost instantly occurs. Diffusion\r\nis inevitable from contact with the water. Now as rain is water, so a\r\nheavy shower falling on ground beneath which great clods of manure have\r\nbeen buried, produces in them no more liquefaction than it does on that\r\nwhich has been dropped in a bucket. On the other hand, if the ground be\r\ncharged with finely pulverized manure, a soaking rain will immediately\r\npenetrate all its comminuted particles, extract the nutriment, and\r\ndeliver it, properly diluted, into the open mouths of the millions of\r\nlittle rootlets which are waiting for it. Practically, this is liquid\r\nmanure on the grandest scale. But no one can quickly realize its\r\nsuperior benefits from a newly buried compost heap, unless the latter\r\nhas been effectually pulverized before being deposited either in or upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nI was so impressed by the example of the thriving German referred to,\r\nthat I resolved to imitate him. He had given me a rich lesson in the art\r\nof manufacturing manures cheaply, though I thought it did not go far\r\nenough. Yet I made an immediate beginning by building a tank in the\r\nbarnyard, into which the wash from stable, pig-pen, and yard was\r\nconducted. This was pumped up and distributed over the top of the manure\r\nheap under the shed, once or twice weekly. A huge compost heap was made\r\nof leaves, each layer being saturated with the liquor as the heap\r\naccumulated, so that the whole mass was moist with fluid manure. It was\r\nnever suffered to become dry. Now, as in the centre of a manure heap\r\nthere is no winter, decomposition went on at a rapid rate, especially\r\namong the leaves, stimulated by the peculiar solvents contained in the\r\nliquor. Thus, when taken out for use in the spring, both heaps had\r\nbecome reduced to a half fluid mass of highly concentrated manure, in a\r\ncondition to be converted, under the first heavy rain, into immediate\r\nfood for plants. Though my money-cost for manure for next season would\r\nbe greater than before, yet my home manufacture was immense. As I was\r\nsure that high manuring was the key to heavy crops and high profits, so\r\nmy studies, this winter, were as diligently pursued in the barnyard as\r\nin the library, and I flattered myself that I had gathered hints enough\r\namong my neighbors to enable me, after next year, to dispense entirely\r\nwith the purchasing of manure.\r\n\r\nBut I had other reasons for avoiding the purchase of manure--none can be\r\npurchased clear of seeds, such as grass and weeds. I have already\r\nsuffered severely from the foul trash that has been sold to me. One\r\nstrong warning of the magnitude of the nuisance was given by the\r\ncondition of my strawberries. A small portion of them was covered, at\r\nthe approach of winter, with litter from the barnyard, and another\r\nportion with cornstalks. The object was protection from the cold; and it\r\nmay be added that the result, so far as protection goes, was very\r\ngratifying. But when the covering was removed in April, the ground\r\nprotected by the barnyard litter was found to be seeded with grass and\r\nother seeds, while that protected by the cornstalks was entirely clean.\r\nDuring a whole year I had the utmost difficulty to get the first piece\r\nof ground clear of these newly planted pests, and am sure that the labor\r\nthus exerted cost more than the strawberries were worth. From this sore\r\nexperience I have learned never to cover this fruit with barnyard\r\nlitter. When they are covered, cornstalks alone are used. They are drawn\r\nback into the balks in April, where they serve as a mulch to keep down\r\nthe weeds, and ultimately decay into manure. Though not so neat to look\r\nat, nor so convenient to handle as straw, yet they answer quite as well,\r\nand at the same time cost a great deal less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMY THIRD YEAR--LIQUID MANURE--THREE YEARS’ RESULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual with me at the opening of spring, the garden received our first\r\nattention. Dick covered it heavily with manure, cleared it up and made\r\nall ready for wife and daughter. This year we had no seeds to purchase,\r\nhaving carefully laid them aside from the last. In order to try for\r\nmyself the value of liquid manuring, I mounted a barrel on a\r\nwheelbarrow, so that it could be turned in any direction, and the liquor\r\nbe discharged through a sprinkler with the greatest convenience. Dick\r\nattended faithfully to this department. As early as January he had begun\r\nto sprinkle the asparagus; indeed he deluged it, putting on not less\r\nthan twenty barrels of liquor before it was forked up. It had received\r\nits full share of rich manure in the autumn: the result of both\r\napplications being a more luxuriant growth of this delightful vegetable\r\nthan perhaps even the Philadelphia market had ever exhibited. The shoots\r\ncame up more numerously than before, were whiter, thicker, and tenderer,\r\nand commanded five cents a bunch more than any other. As the bed was a\r\nlarge one, and the yield great, we sold to the amount of $21. I\r\ncertainly never tasted so luscious and tender an article. Its\r\nsuperiority was justly traceable, to some extent, to the liquid manure.\r\n\r\nThe same stimulant was freely administered all over the garden, and with\r\nmarked results. It was never used in dry weather, nor when a hot sun was\r\nshining. We contrived to get it on at the beginning of a rain, or during\r\ndrizzly weather, so that it should be immediately diluted and then\r\ncarried down to the roots. I have no doubt it promoted the growth of\r\nweeds, as there was certainly more of them to kill this season than ever\r\nbefore. But we had all become reconciled to the sight of weeds--expected\r\nthem as a matter of course--and my wife and Kate became thorough\r\nconverts to Dick’s heresy as to the impossibility of ever getting rid of\r\nthem. I was pained to hear of this declension from what I regarded as\r\nthe only true faith; but when I saw the terrible armies which came up in\r\nthe garden just as regularly as Dick distributed his liquor, I confess\r\nthey had abundant reason for the faith that was in them.\r\n\r\nBut the barnyard fluid was a good thing, notwithstanding. It brought the\r\nearly beets into market ten days ahead of all competitors, thus securing\r\nthe best prices. It was the same with radishes and salad. The latter is\r\nscarcely ever to be had in small country towns, and then only at high\r\nrates. But whether it was owing to the liquor or not, I will not say,\r\nbut it came early into market in the best possible condition; and as\r\nthere happened to be plenty of it, we sold to the amount of $19 of the\r\nvery early, and then, as prices lowered, continued to send it to the\r\nstore as long as it commanded two cents a head, after which the cow and\r\npigs became exclusive customers. The fall vegetables, such as white\r\nonions, carrots and parsnips, having had more of the liquor, did even\r\nbetter, for they grew to very large size. It was the same thing with\r\ncurrants and gooseberries. The whole together produced $83; to which\r\nmust be added the ten peach-trees, all which I had thinned out when the\r\nfruit was the size of hickory nuts, and with the same success as the\r\nprevious year. This was in 1857, that time of panic, suspension, and\r\ninsolvency. That year had been noted, even from its opening, as one of\r\ngreat scarcity of money in the cities, when all unlucky enough to need\r\nit were compelled to pay the highest rates for its use. But we in the\r\ncountry, being out of the ring, gave way to no panic, felt no scarcity,\r\nexperienced no insolvency. Peaches brought as high a price as ever; as,\r\nlet times in the city be black as they may, there is always money enough\r\nin somebody’s hands to exchange for all the choice fruit that goes to\r\nmarket. The fruit from the ten trees produced me $69, making the whole\r\nproduct of the garden $152. I thought this was not doing well enough,\r\nand resolved to do better another year.\r\n\r\nAt the usual season for the weeds to show themselves on the nine acres,\r\nit very soon became evident that two years’ warfare had resulted in a\r\ncomparative conquest. It may be safely said that there was not half the\r\nusual number, and so it continued throughout the season. But no exertion\r\nwas spared to keep them under, none being allowed to go to seed. This\r\nwatchfulness being continued from that day to this, the mastery has been\r\ncomplete. We still have weeds, but are no longer troubled with them as\r\nat the beginning. The secret lies in a nutshell--let none go to seed.\r\nNor let any cultivator be discouraged, no matter how formidable the host\r\nhe may have to attack at the beginning. But if he will procure the\r\nproper labor-saving tools, and drive them with a determined\r\nperseverance, success is sure.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the strawberries came first into market, and were prepared and\r\nsent off with even more care than formerly. The money pressure in the\r\ncities caused no reduction in price, and my net receipts were $903. An\r\nexperienced grower near me, with only four acres, cleared $1,200 the\r\nsame season. His crop was much heavier than mine. If he had practised\r\nthe same care in assorting his fruit for market, he would have realized\r\nseveral hundred dollars more. But his effort was for quantity, not\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nA portion of the raspberries had been thoroughly watered with the liquid\r\nmanure, all through the colder spring months. It was too great a labor,\r\nwith a single wheelbarrow, to supply the whole two acres, or it would\r\nhave been similarly treated. But the portion thus supplied was certainly\r\nthree times as productive as the portion not supplied. My whole net\r\nreceipts from raspberries amounted to $267. The plants were now well\r\nrooted, and were in prime bearing condition. Since this, I have\r\nquadrupled my facilities for applying the liquid manure. A large\r\nhogshead has been mounted on low wheels, the rims of which are four\r\ninches wide, so as to prevent them sinking into the ground, the whole\r\nbeing constructed to weigh as little as possible. The sprinkling\r\napparatus will drench one or two rows at a time, as may be desired. The\r\ndriver rides on the cart, and by raising or lowering a valve, lets on or\r\nshuts off the flow of liquor at his pleasure. Having been used on the\r\nraspberries for several years, I can testify to the extraordinary value\r\nof this mode of applying manure. It stimulates an astonishing growth of\r\ncanes, increases the quantity of fruit, while it secures the grand\r\ndesideratum, a prodigious enlargement in the size of the berries. I find\r\nby inquiry among my neighbors that none of them get so high prices as\r\nmyself. Every crop has been growing more profitable than the preceding\r\none; and it may be set down that an acre of raspberries, treated and\r\nattended to as they ought to be, will realize a net profit of $200\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe Lawtons were this year to come into stronger bearing. Parties in New\r\nYork and Philadelphia had agreed to take all my crop, and guarantee me\r\ntwenty-five cents a quart. One speculator came to my house and offered\r\n$200 for the crop, before the berries were ripe. I should have accepted\r\nthe offer, thinking that was money enough to make from one acre, had not\r\nmy obligation to send the fruit to other parties interfered with a sale.\r\nBut I made out a trifle better, as the quantity marketed amounted to 896\r\nquarts, which netted me $206.08. In addition to this, the sales of\r\nplants amounted to $101. As the market price for plants was falling, I\r\nwas not anxious to multiply them to the injury of the fruit; hence many\r\nsuckers were cut down outside of the rows, so as to throw the whole\r\nenergy of the roots into the berries; and I think the result justified\r\nthis course. The demand for the fruit was so great, that I could have\r\nreadily sold four times as much at the same price. As the season for the\r\nblackberries closed, all the stray fruit was gathered and converted into\r\nan admirable wine. Some seventy bottles were made for home use; and when\r\na year old, I discovered that it was of ready sale at half a dollar per\r\nbottle. Since then we have made a barrel of wine annually; and when old\r\nenough, all not needed for domestic purposes is sold at $2 per gallon.\r\nIt is a small item of our general income, but quite sufficient to show\r\nthat vast profit may be made by any person going largely into the\r\nbusiness of manufacturing blackberry-wine.\r\n\r\nWe raised nothing of value among the blackberries this year. The growth\r\nof new wood had been so luxuriant, that the ground between the rows was\r\ntoo much shaded to permit other plants to mature. In some places, the\r\nhuge canes, throwing out branches six to seven feet long, had\r\ninterlocked with each other from row to row, and were cut away, to\r\nenable the cultivator and weeder to pass along between them, and\r\nthenceforward this acre was given up entirely to the blackberries. As\r\nthe roots wandered away for twenty or thirty feet in search of\r\nnourishment, they acquired new power to force up stronger and more\r\nnumerous canes. Many of these came up profusely in a direct line with\r\nthe original plants. When not standing too close together, they were\r\ncarefully preserved, when of vigorous growth; but the feeble ones were\r\ntaken up and sold. Thus, in a few years, a row which had been\r\noriginally set with plants eight feet apart became a compact hedge, and\r\nan acre supporting full six times as many bearing canes as when first\r\nplanted. Hence the crop of fruit should increase annually. It will\r\ncontinue to do so, if not more than three vigorous canes are allowed to\r\ngrow in one cluster; if the canes are cut down in July to three or four\r\nfeet high; if the branches are cut back to a foot in length; if the\r\ngrowth of all suckers between the rows is thoroughly stopped by treating\r\nthem the same as weeds; if the old-bearing wood is nicely taken out at\r\nthe close of every season; and, finally, if the plants are bountifully\r\nsupplied with manure. From long experience with this admirable fruit, I\r\nlay it down as a rule that every single condition above stated must be\r\ncomplied with, if the grower expects abundant crops of the very finest\r\nfruit. Observe them, and the result is certain; neglect them, and the\r\nreward will be inferior fruit, to sell at inferior prices.\r\n\r\nTo the Lawtons succeeded the peaches, now their first bearing year. We\r\nhad protected them for three seasons from the fly by keeping the butts\r\nwell tarred, and they were now about to give some return for this\r\ncareful but unexpensive oversight. Some few of them produced no fruit\r\nwhatever, but the majority made a respectable show. I went over the\r\norchard myself, examining each tree with the utmost care, and removed\r\nevery peach of inferior size, as well as thinning out even good ones\r\nwhich happened to be too much crowded together. Being of the earlier\r\nsorts, they came into market in advance of a glut; and though the\r\nmoney-pressure in the cities was now about culminating in the memorable\r\nexplosion of September, yet there was still money enough left in the\r\npockets of the multitude to pay good prices for peaches. It is with\r\nfruit as it is with rum--men are never too poor to buy both. My 804\r\ntrees produced me $208 clear of expenses, with a pretty sure prospect of\r\ndoing much better hereafter. I had learned from experience that a shrewd\r\ngrower need not be apprehensive of a glut; and that if panics palsied,\r\nor a general insolvency desolated the cities they still contrived to\r\nhold as much money as before. Credit might disappear, but the money\r\nremained; and the industrious tiller of the soil was sure to get his\r\nfull share of the general fund which survives even the worst convulsion.\r\n\r\nMy acre of tomatoes netted me this year $192, my pork $61, my potatoes\r\n$40, and the calf $3. Thus, as my grounds became charged with\r\nmanure,--as I restored to it the waste occasioned by the crops that were\r\nremoved from it, and even more than that waste,--so my crops increased\r\nin value. It was thus demonstrable that manuring would pay. On the\r\nclover-field the most signal evidence of this was apparent. After each\r\ncutting of clover had been taken to the barnyard, the liquor-cart\r\ndistributed over the newly mown sod a copious supply of liquid manure,\r\nthus regularly restoring to the earth an equivalent for the crop\r\nremoved. It was most instructive to see how immediately after each\r\napplication the well-rooted clover shot up into luxuriant growth. I have\r\nthus mowed it three times in a season, and can readily believe that in\r\nthe moister climate of England and Flanders as many as six crops are\r\nannually taken from grass lands thus treated with liquid manure. Indeed,\r\nI am inclined to believe that there is no reasonable limit to the yield\r\nof an acre of ground which is constantly and heavily manured, and\r\ncultivated by one who thoroughly understands his art.\r\n\r\nThree years’ experience of profit and loss is quite sufficient for the\r\npurposes of this volume. It has satisfied me, as it should satisfy\r\nothers, that Ten Acres are Enough.

But rejecting the income\r\nfrom the sale of plants, the pigs, and the calf, as exceptional things,\r\nand the profit of the nine acres for the first year will be found to be\r\nnothing per acre, for the second year, $83.50, and for the third,\r\n$129.10. But there are obvious reasons why this should be so. The ground\r\nwas crowded to its utmost capacity with those plants only which yielded\r\nthe very highest rate of profit, and for which there was an unfailing\r\ndemand. In addition to this, it was cultivated with the most unflagging\r\nindustry and care. Besides using the contents of more than one barnyard\r\nupon it, I literally manured it with brains. My whole mind and energies\r\nwere devoted to improving and attending to it. No city business was ever\r\nmore industriously or intelligently supervised than this. But if the\r\nreward was ample, it was no greater than others all around me were\r\nannually realizing, the only difference being that they cultivated more\r\nground. While they diffused their labor over twenty acres, I\r\nconcentrated mine on ten. Yet, having only half as much ground to work\r\nover, I realized as large a profit as the average of them all.\r\nConcentrated labor and manuring thus brought the return which is always\r\nrealized from them when intelligently combined.\r\n\r\nFor six years since 1857 I have continued to cultivate this little farm.\r\nSometimes an unpropitious season has cut down my profits to a low\r\nfigure, but I have never lost money on the year’s business. Now and then\r\na crop or two has utterly failed, as some seasons are too dry, and\r\nothers are too wet. But among the variety cultivated some are sure to\r\nsucceed. Only once or twice have I failed to invest a few hundred\r\ndollars at the year’s end. All other business has been studiously\r\navoided. I have spent considerable money in adding to the convenience of\r\nmy dwelling, and the extent of my outbuildings; among the latter is a\r\nlittle shop furnished with more tools than are generally to be found\r\nupon a farm, which save me many dollars in a year, and many errands to\r\nthe carpenter and wheelwright. The marriage of my daughter Kate called\r\nfor a genteel outfit, which she received without occasioning me any\r\ninconvenience. I buy nothing on credit, and for more than ten years have\r\nhad no occasion to give a note. If at the year’s end we are found to owe\r\nany thing at the stores, it is promptly paid. As means increased, my\r\nfamily has lived more expensively, though I think not any more\r\ncomfortably. I lie down peacefully at night, thinking that I do not\r\ndeserve more than others, but thankful that God has given me more. I\r\nrise in the morning with an appetite for labor as keen as that for\r\nbreakfast. But others can succeed as well as myself. Capital or no\r\ncapital, the proper industry and determination will certainly be\r\nrewarded by success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nA BARNYARD MANUFACTORY--LAND ENOUGH--FAITH IN MANURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, there is no successful farming without a liberal\r\nexpenditure for manure. I had proved that high manuring would pay, and\r\nwhile anxious to increase the quantity, was desirous of reducing the\r\nmoney-cost. I continued every season to scour the neighborhood for\r\nleaves, and to gather up every available material for the barnyard. But\r\nin addition to all this, in October and November of my fourth year I\r\npurchased twenty heifers which would calve in the spring, intending to\r\nfeed them through the winter, and then sell as soon as they had calved.\r\nMy idea was, that they could be sold for a profit large enough to cover\r\nthe cost of keeping them, thus having the manure all clear. I consulted\r\nmany persons versed in this business, farmers, butchers, and others,\r\nbefore venturing on it, as it was a good deal out of my usual line of\r\noperations. I also consulted all my files of agricultural papers, where\r\nI found set forth a multitude of experiences on the subject, the most of\r\nwhich led me to conclude that it would be safe to try the experiment.\r\nThere seemed to be but little danger of loss, even if nothing were made,\r\nwhile it was quite certain a good deal of knowledge would be gained.\r\n\r\nI accordingly had a rough shed built, large enough to contain twenty\r\ncows, with an entry in front of them and a large feed-room at one end.\r\nThen mangers were provided, and a plank gutter laid just back of where\r\nthe cows would stand, into which all the droppings would fall, and down\r\nwhich the water would run into a wide earthen pipe which emptied into\r\nthe cistern in the barnyard. Here the cows stood in a row, never being\r\nallowed to go out, except an hour or two at noon when the weather was\r\nfine. I agreed with Dick to take entire charge of the feeding and\r\nwatering them, for the consideration of $30 extra. I bought the\r\ncornstalks from some twenty acres near me, at $3 an acre, and these were\r\ndelivered from time to time as they were needed, there not being room on\r\nthe premises for so large a quantity at once. I had provided a superior\r\ncutter, with which Dick cut up the stalks and blades, reducing them to\r\npieces a half-inch long, and he then put them into a hogshead of water,\r\nwhere they remained a day and night to soak. Thence they were\r\ntransferred to a steaming apparatus, constructed expressly for this\r\npurpose, where they were made perfectly soft. Corn meal, bran, and\r\nvarious kinds of ground feed were mixed in and steamed with the cut\r\nstalks, a sprinkling of salt being added. A day’s feed for the whole\r\ntwenty was cooked at one operation. This preparation came out soft and\r\npalatable, and the cows took to it greedily. The ground feed was varied\r\nduring the season, and occasionally a few turnips, parsnips, and\r\ncabbages were cooked up to increase the variety. I had no hay to give\r\nthem, and they got none.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, Dick gave them four good strong messes every day,\r\nthat at night being a very heavy one. He said they throve as well as any\r\ncattle he had ever seen. The gutter behind them was cleaned out twice a\r\nday and sprinkled with plaster, thus keeping the place always clean and\r\nsweet. In fact, I made cleanliness the order of the day throughout the\r\nentire barnyard. The manure was thrown directly from the gutter into a\r\nwheelbarrow having a thick layer of leaves spread over its bottom, and\r\nthen emptied in a heap under the manure shed. As the cows were also\r\nlittered with leaves, these, when too foul for longer use, were taken to\r\nthe same heap. Others were added, with cornstalks in occasional layers;\r\nand as each layer was deposited, the whole heap was saturated with\r\nliquor from the cistern. I do not think a better lot of common barnyard\r\nmanure has ever been manufactured. Dick entered into the spirit of the\r\nexperiment, and carried it through without once faltering.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cows began dropping their calves in the spring, I\r\nadvertised them, and plenty of purchasers appeared, as a choice out of\r\ntwenty was of some value. They had cost me $22 each. I had kept them an\r\naverage of one hundred and forty days for each cow, at a cost of six\r\ncents per day for each, or $8.40, making with the first cost $30.40 per\r\ncow, or $608 for the whole. To this was added $60 for cornstalks and $40\r\nfor Dick, making a grand total of $708. I sold them at an average of\r\n$35.50, and thus realized $710, or a cash profit of $2. Instead of\r\npaying Dick $30 for his trouble, I told the fellow that as he had\r\nperformed his duty so satisfactorily, he should have $40. This little\r\nvoluntary contribution so gratified him, that I feel assured its value\r\nhas been refunded to me fourfold, by his subsequent attention as a\r\nprofessor of the art and mystery of manufacturing manure.\r\n\r\nThus I made $2 in cash by the operation, besides having a great quantity\r\nof cornstalks left over, and a pile of manure certainly as ample as any\r\nfor which I had paid $250. Moreover, it was on my own premises; it had\r\nbeen most carefully attended to during the whole process of manufacture;\r\nI knew what it was composed of, and that the seeds of noxious weeds\r\ncould not have been added to it. All these facts gave it value over the\r\nchance lots which farmers are often compelled to purchase, and from\r\nwhich their fields are many times sowed with thousands of weeds. Here\r\nwas a clear saving of $250 added to my profits.\r\n\r\nThe result was so encouraging, that I have continued the practice of\r\nthus feeding cattle during the winter from that day to this, increasing\r\nthe number, however, to twenty-five. I find no difficulty in making\r\nsales in the spring. Sometimes I have lost a few dollars on a winter’s\r\noperations, sometimes made a little profit, and sometimes come out just\r\neven. On the run of four years there has been no profit beyond the\r\nmanure; but that much is all clear. Thus the winter, instead of being a\r\nseason of suspended profits as formerly, is now one of positive gain.\r\nThe operation of thus feeding cattle is certainly attended with trouble.\r\nBut once provided with all the conveniences for carrying it on, it is\r\nnot only simple and easy, but becomes even interesting. No one who has\r\nnot tried it in a careful, methodical way, can have any idea of the\r\nrapidity with which the manure heaps grow, nor the size to which they\r\nultimately attain. My neighbors having long since ceased to be amused at\r\nwhat they facetiously called the novelty of my operations, did not\r\nventure to ridicule even this. On the contrary, they rather approved of\r\nit, though not one of them could tell how much it cost to keep a cow per\r\nweek. But I impute no part of my success to their approval. The practice\r\nis intrinsically a good one, and only needs being carried on properly to\r\nmake it pay.\r\n\r\nLet me add, that there is a very cheap and convenient mode of covering\r\nmanure from the weather, which I have constantly practised, thus\r\navoiding the cost of building sheds. I took inch boards which were\r\nsixteen feet long, and sawed them in half, making two lengths, each\r\neight feet. The boards were as wide as could be had, say twenty inches.\r\nBattens were then nailed across each end and the centre, to prevent\r\nwarping. Then to each end a board of equal width, and five feet long,\r\nwas secured by strap hinges. The manure heap was then built up, say five\r\nfeet high, and eight wide at the top. When thus finished, one of the\r\nboards was placed across the top; the ends being hinged, fell down, over\r\nthe sides of the heap, and touched the ground. Beginning at one end of\r\nthe heap, the hinged boards were laid on until they reached to the other\r\nend. Thus the entire heap, except the ends, was completely protected\r\nfrom the weather. The ends were covered with loose boards. Whenever rain\r\nwas coming on, and it was thought the heap needed water to prevent\r\nfire-fanging, this portable shed was lifted off in five minutes. After\r\nreceiving a good soaking, the shed was in five more minutes replaced on\r\nthe heap; and when no composting was going on, the boards were simply\r\nstowed away in some by-place until again wanted. To those who believe in\r\nthe value of housing manure, but who cannot afford to erect buildings\r\nfor the purpose, these portable sheds will be found, for $10, to be as\r\neffectual as a building costing $60, while at the same time they do not\r\noccupy any useful ground.\r\n\r\nI will not say that ten acres in New Jersey can be made to produce more\r\nmoney than ten acres located elsewhere, within reach of the great city\r\nmarkets. Without doubt, the productiveness of either tract will be in\r\nexact proportion to the care and skill of cultivation, and the\r\nthoroughness of manuring. In either case, it is utter folly for a man to\r\nattempt the cultivation of more land than he can manage thoroughly. The\r\nchances are then invariably against him. I consider the real office of\r\nthe ground to be merely that of holding a plant in an erect position,\r\nwhile you feed the roots. But it is nevertheless remarkable that the\r\ncensus tables show that the product of New Jersey per acre, when the\r\nwhole area of the State is taken into account, is considerably greater\r\nthan in any of the adjoining States. The product per acre, in some of\r\nthe fruit-growing counties nearest the two great cities, is even more\r\nremarkable. The average cash value of the products of all our market\r\ngardens is $20 annually, while that of the gardens in New York and\r\nPennsylvania is only $5 each. Of our orchards it is $25, while in New\r\nYork it is only $10, and in Pennsylvania only $5. The value of\r\nagricultural implements and machinery is relatively far greater than in\r\neither of these empire States. Nothing short of a superior\r\nproductiveness for truck and fruit, in the soil of New Jersey, can\r\naccount for such results.\r\n\r\nA farmer in my neighborhood sold from forty early apple-trees, occupying\r\nabout one acre of land, 400 baskets of fruit, which yielded, after\r\ndeducting expenses, and ten per cent. commission for selling, $241.50. I\r\nhave known pears to be sold at from $3 to $5 per basket, and in smaller\r\nquantities at $2 a half-peck; and three cherry-trees, of the early\r\nRichmond variety, yielded $30 worth of fruit. Peach-trees, when\r\nprotected from the worm, will bear luxuriantly for twenty years.\r\n\r\nI know a small farmer, with six acres of rhubarb, who has realized $600\r\ndollars annually from it. Another has twenty acres of asparagus, from\r\nwhich he realizes $600 per week during the season for cutting. Besides,\r\nit grows an acre of common gooseberries, from which his annual profit is\r\n$200. I have known another to sell $500 worth of tomatoes from a single\r\nacre, besides having many bushels for the hog-pen. I could name owners\r\nof very small tracts who are doing well in the same business. Asparagus,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, blackberries, currants, grapes, and\r\ngooseberries, grow to perfection, and yield enormous returns when\r\nproperly attended to, far surpassing any thing ever obtained from the\r\nheavier staple crops, such as grain, grass and stock.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be noticed that the greatest profit per acre is almost\r\ninvariably realized by those who have very small farms. The less they\r\nhave, the more thoroughly is it cultivated; while the few who have\r\nsufficient faith in manure, and who thus convert their entire holding\r\ninto a garden, realize twice or thrice as much per annum as they had\r\npaid for the land. I knew a striking illustration of the value of this\r\nfaith in manure. It is in the person of a Jerseyman who began,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, upon a single acre of rented land, with a capital\r\nof only $50, borrowed from a sister who had saved it from her earnings\r\nas a dairymaid. This man regarded the earth as of no practical use\r\nexcept to receive and hold manure; and his idea was, that if he crowded\r\nit full enough, every rain would extract from it, and convey directly to\r\nthe roots of the plants, the liquid nutriment which gives to all\r\nvegetation such amazing vigor. Thus, the solids, if in sufficient\r\nsupply, would be sure to furnish the liquids, on which he knew he could\r\nrely. Though full of original and practical ideas, this was his\r\nabsorbing one; and he pursued it with an energy of purpose and a\r\nliberality of expenditure that surprised the population of an entire\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disadvantages attendant on a neglected education, the\r\nforce of this man’s strong natural sense carried him forward with\r\nastonishing rapidity. True to his faith in manure, he bought and\r\nmanufactured to an extent far exceeding all his neighbors. He soon\r\nobtained possession of a small farm, with ample time allowed for\r\npayment; for his industry and skill established a character, and\r\ncharacter served for capital. In a few years he monopolized the contents\r\nof all the pig-pens in the city near which he resided, all that was\r\nproduced by the slaughter-houses, all the lime from the gas-works, all\r\nthe spent bark from the tanneries, and every tub of night-soil which\r\ncame from the water-closets of a large population. He created a demand\r\nfor manure so general, that the streets were traversed by men and boys\r\nwith carts and handbarrows, who daily picked up the droppings from the\r\nnumerous livestock which passed over the roads, and piled them snugly in\r\nfence-corners, composting them with leaves and rubbish, knowing that the\r\ngreat manure king would take them all. The quantity thus collected by\r\nthese industrious scavengers was very large. In addition to all this, he\r\npurchased cargoes of marl, charcoal cinders from the pines, guano, and\r\nsloop-loads of manures from the city. The world within his reach seemed\r\nunable to supply his vast demand.\r\n\r\nHis cash outlay for these fertilizers was of course enormous, and has\r\namounted to thousands of dollars per annum. It has been constantly\r\nincreasing, and grows even as I write. But his faith in manure was\r\naccompanied by works. What he thus collected at so great a cost, was\r\napplied with singular shrewdness to the production of fruits and\r\nvegetables for the great city markets. His fields rewarded him in\r\nproportion as he enriched them. His neighbors, who, for miles around,\r\nhad been astonished and incredulous at his unprecedented outlay for\r\nmanure, were in turn astonished at the extraordinary quantities of fruit\r\nand truck which he dispatched to market. As he went early and largely\r\ninto the growing of rhubarb, when all others were too timid even to\r\ntouch it, so for years he was the only man who sent tons of it to market\r\nduring a long period in which it paid extravagant profits. By skilfully\r\nregulating his crops, he secured an uninterrupted succession during the\r\nentire season; so that from the earliest to the latest period of the\r\nyear he was constantly receiving large cash returns. His wagons have\r\nsometimes loaded an entire steamboat, sometimes an entire train upon the\r\nrailroad. By growing asparagus, he has realized great profits. For years\r\nhe commanded the Baltimore markets with his strawberries, while various\r\nother large towns depended on him for their supplies. I have been upon\r\nhis thirty acres of this fruit during the height of the season, when\r\nfifty pickers were at work on ground which wore a tinge of luscious\r\nscarlet under the astonishing profusion of the crop; while thousands of\r\nquarts, under adjacent sheds, were in process of being boxed for market.\r\nOf this fruit he has sent ninety bushels to market in a single day,\r\ndistributed $300 in a week among his pickers, while in the boxes to\r\ncontain them his investment is $1,500. On strawberries alone this man\r\ncould have grown rich.\r\n\r\nBut they are scarcely a tithe of what he has produced. Raspberries,\r\nblackberries, and all the smaller fruits have been cultivated quite as\r\nextensively. The same courageous intelligence which led him to out-strip\r\nall competitors in the application of manure, kept him awake to every\r\nimprovement in fruit or vegetable as it came before the public. He not\r\nonly procured the best of every kind, but bought them early, no matter\r\nhow extravagant the price. Thus keeping in advance of all others, so his\r\nprofits have exceeded theirs. More than once he has been cheated by the\r\npurchase of novelties of this kind, besides losing time and money in\r\ncultivating them long enough to prove the cheat; but these losses have\r\nbeen but as dust in the great balance of his profit.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, such a man could not fail to become rich. From his\r\nhumble beginning of a single acre he has gone on adding farm to farm,\r\nhouse to house, and lot to lot, and is ever on hand to purchase more.\r\nHis passion is to own land. But even so thorough a farmer as he may in\r\nthe end acquire too much to be profitable.\r\n\r\nThe example thus set has had a marked influence on the population of\r\nentire townships. Men who at first, and who even for years, were\r\nincredulous of the propriety of using such vast quantities of manure, at\r\nlength became converts to the example. High farming thus came\r\nextensively into vogue. Meantime the facilities for getting to market\r\nwere being constantly multiplied. New fertilizers were introduced and\r\nkept for sale in all the country towns, the facility for obtaining them\r\nthus inducing a general consumption. As crops increased, so the great\r\ncities grew in size, the number of mouths to be fed enlarging with the\r\nsupply of food. Under the pressure of all these several inducements,\r\nfruit and truck have been produced in quantities that cannot be\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThe first great impulse to its enlarged production in the neighborhood\r\nwhere the enterprising consumer of manure resided, to whom reference has\r\nbeen made, was the result of his example. His great success removed all\r\ndoubt and disarmed all opposition. But even his was not achieved without\r\nunremitting industry and intelligent application of the mind. Neither\r\nhis hands nor the manure did every thing. But manure lay at the\r\nfoundation of the edifice: without it he would have toiled in vain to\r\nbuild up an ample fortune from the humblest of beginnings. As he\r\nsucceeded, so let others take counsel, and have faith in manure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPROFITS OF FRUIT-GROWING--THE TRADE IN BERRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be supposed that agriculture is always a successful pursuit.\r\nOn the contrary, we know it many times to be the reverse. But when one\r\nlooks carefully into that branch of it which embraces fruits, especially\r\nthe smaller kinds, the evidences in its favor as a money-making business\r\nmultiply as we proceed. The reader must have some knowledge of the\r\nprodigious profits realized a few years since by the peach-growers in\r\nDelaware, where 800 acres were cultivated in that fruit by a single\r\nindividual. At one time he was compelled to charter several steamboats\r\nduring the entire season, to convey his thousands of baskets to market.\r\nFrom only 70 acres the owner has realized a net profit of $12,000, in\r\none season. The instance of my relative in Ohio, mentioned in an earlier\r\nchapter, affords another illustration of what a very small orchard can\r\nbe made to yield. I have known single peach-trees in gardens, in seasons\r\nwhen the general crop was short, producing as much as $20 each. Those\r\nwho buy single peaches at the street corners in our cities, one or two\r\nfor a dime, can readily understand these figures. I could point out a\r\ngarden belonging to a widow, containing twelve plum-trees, from which\r\nshe regularly receives $60 every year, and sometimes even more. Grapes\r\nare never so abundant in market as to reduce the price below the point\r\nof profit.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for pears are such as to seem absurdly high. But even\r\nwhen rebellion had most depressed the market, I knew a single tree to\r\nnet $23 to the owner. Another grower, from three trees, annually\r\nreceives $60. A citizen of New York is the owner of three pear-trees\r\nwhich have yielded eleven barrels, and produced $137. There is another\r\ntree in that State, seventy years old, from which, in that period,\r\n$3,750 worth of pears have been sold--enough to pay for a farm. A young\r\norchard of four hundred trees, some eight years after planting, at two\r\nyears’ crops yielded the owner $1,450. An acre of the best pear-trees,\r\nwell managed, will produce more profit than a five-hundred-acre farm,\r\nwithout a twentieth of the care or capital.\r\n\r\nBut examples almost without number may be given, where apple-trees also\r\nhave yielded from five to ten dollars a year in fruit, and many\r\ninstances in which twenty or thirty dollars have been obtained. If one\r\ntree of the Rhode Island Greening will afford forty bushels of fruit, at\r\na quarter of a dollar per bushel, which has often occurred, forty such\r\ntrees on an acre would yield a crop worth four hundred dollars. But\r\ntaking one quarter of this amount as a low average for all seasons, and\r\nwith imperfect cultivation, one hundred dollars will still be equal to\r\nthe interest on fifteen hundred per acre. Now, this estimate is based\r\nupon the price of good winter apples for the past thirty years, in one\r\nof our most productive districts; let a similar estimate be made with\r\nfruits rarer and of a more delicate character. Apricots and the finer\r\nvarieties of the plum are often sold for three to six dollars per\r\nbushel, and the best early peaches from one to three dollars. An\r\nacquaintance received eight dollars for a crop grown on two fine young\r\ncherry-trees, and twenty-four dollars from four young peach-trees of\r\nonly four years’ growth from the bud. In Western New York, single trees\r\nof the Doyenne or Virgalieu pear have often afforded a return of twenty\r\ndollars or more, after being sent hundreds of miles to market.\r\n\r\nThese standard fruits, requiring several years to come into bearing, are\r\ntoo slow for the majority of cultivators, who, like myself, need\r\nsomething which will pay in a year or two. The whole berry family is\r\npre-eminently adapted to meet this demand for immediate profit. Happily\r\nfor the multitude engaged in its propagation, the business cannot be\r\noverdone. Could an exact calculation be made of the money expended in\r\nthe city of New York merely for the small fruits, the amount would be so\r\nenormous as to be scarcely credible, and would go far to prove the\r\nimmense wealth which actually exists, in spite of the fact that\r\nthousands are suffering all the stings of poverty. Take the strawberry\r\nas a faint index of the large sums of money that are annually laid out\r\nin the different varieties of fruit. One of the most ephemeral of all\r\nfruits, only lasting its brief month, the strawberry nevertheless plays\r\nno insignificant part in the _rôle_ of our early summer business. In\r\nfact, this little berry may be said to be the prime favorite of the\r\nseason. Of a delicious flavor, with just sufficient of tartness to\r\nrender it agreeable, it commends itself to the taste of young and old;\r\nwhile its cooling properties render it highly beneficial, in a hygienic\r\npoint of view, during the early heats of the dog-days. Then its\r\ncheapness places it within the reach of the poorest. It is alike welcome\r\nto the schoolboy who has a few cents of pocket money to invest in such\r\ndelicacies as schoolboys are wont to indulge in; to the laboring man,\r\nafter the burden and heat of the day are over; and to the wealthy, who\r\nhas at his command the means of enjoyment of the most expensive kind.\r\n\r\nThe first strawberries during the season generally appear at the\r\nBroadway saloons about the middle of May, and are sold at the very\r\nmodest price of fifty cents per pint basket. A placard in the window\r\nannounces that a plateful, with cream, may be had for a similar small\r\nconsideration. These early strawberries are from Virginia; but as they\r\nare small, with immaturity stamped upon them, it is to be presumed that\r\nthere is not a very great rush for fifty cents’ worth, even by such as\r\nfeel like boasting that they had eaten strawberries and cream ere the\r\nfrosts of winter had well disappeared. Soon, however, New Jersey begins\r\nto give up her stores of the delicious fruit, and prices fall from fifty\r\nto fifteen, from fifteen to six, from six to five, and finally from five\r\nto three cents per pint.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire early crop of the New York market is grown in New\r\nJersey, and by far the largest quantity brought into the city by any one\r\nroute reaches New York by the New York and Erie Railroad Company. The\r\nberries are conveyed in carts and wagons from the gardens where they\r\nare grown to the several railroad stations, whence they find their way\r\nto the respective ferries. Great quantities, however, are conveyed in\r\nwagons direct to the ferries. Hence it is next to impossible to obtain\r\nexact information of the actual quantities brought into the city, and\r\nconsumed by the inhabitants. All that can be done is to convey an\r\napproximate idea of the immense extent of the trade, leaving the reader\r\nto imagine what must be the actual quantity, since that of which\r\nauthentic information can be obtained is so enormous.\r\n\r\nThe berries are largely shipped from Burlington, Monmouth, and Middlesex\r\ncounties in New Jersey. Large quantities are also grown in Bergen. The\r\nBergen County Journal says, that from data furnished, it considers\r\n10,000,000 baskets a low estimate of the quantity sent to market in one\r\nseason from that county alone. This evidently is a mistake, for, after a\r\nvery close inquiry into the matter, it does not appear that any thing\r\nlike that quantity has reached New York from all places where the berry\r\nis grown. Even supposing that other markets besides that of New York are\r\nindicated, the quantity named seems too large for credibility, as having\r\nbeen grown in a single county, however favorable the soil may be to the\r\nproduction of the fruit, and notwithstanding the utmost indefatigability\r\nof the growers; and the more so when the Journal adds, “that thousands,\r\nperhaps millions of baskets, have rotted on the vines.”\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Northern Railroad of New Jersey to Piermont, is\r\nanother circumstance which has given an impetus to the trade. The\r\nopening took place just at the commencement of the season of 1859,--not\r\nearly enough for the growers to make their arrangements for a very large\r\ncrop, but just in time to enable them to take full advantage of the\r\nmeans of transit over the line, of the then ripening crop. Accordingly,\r\nas far as can be ascertained, 400,000 baskets were brought over the new\r\nroad. This looks well for a commencement, and holds out a good promise\r\nof an enormous trade in future seasons. The section of country through\r\nwhich the line runs, quietly undulating, is well watered, and admirably\r\nadapted to the growth of the strawberry; and as the settlements are\r\nwithin easy distances of the stations, the fruit can be sent into market\r\nfresh picked and sound, retaining its full, rich flavor.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the strawberry is very little attended to on Long\r\nIsland. On inquiry at the railroad station there, it was found that so\r\nsmall is the quantity brought over by it, that it was not deemed worth\r\nwhile to charge freight for the few parcels carried by travellers. The\r\nquantity may be safely set down at 25,000 baskets. No business is done\r\nin this fruit over the Hudson or the Harlem and New Haven Railroads.\r\n\r\nBesides the railroads, the steamboats bring to market large quantities\r\nof the fruit. It is impossible to obtain correct statistical information\r\nof the trade from this source. The quantity brought from Keyport, N. J.,\r\nalone, by two vessels, has been estimated at 1,750,000 baskets.\r\n\r\nThe following is an epitome of the business done, as far as can be\r\nascertained:--\r\n\r\n                                             Baskets.\r\n  Over the New York and Erie Railroad       3,253,407\r\n    “   “ Railroad of Northern New Jersey     400,000\r\n    “   “ Long Island Railroad                 25,000\r\n    “   “ Camden and Amboy Railroad         1,100,000\r\n  From Keyport, in vessels                  1,750,000\r\n    “  Hoboken and other places, in wagons    500,000\r\n                                            ---------\r\n                                            7,028,407\r\n\r\nSay seven millions of baskets, in round numbers. Of the three and a\r\nquarter millions brought over the New York and Erie Railroad, somewhat\r\nmore than one-half are from Ramsey’s and Allendale station, and the\r\nremainder from the stations on the Union Railroad and the Piermont\r\nbranch. Of those brought by the Camden and Amboy Railroad, the great\r\nbulk is from Burlington county.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form a correct estimate of the average price at which\r\nstrawberries sell; but by carefully collating the statements of the\r\nprincipal wholesale dealers, and taking the mean of the several prices,\r\nthroughout the season, $3 per hundred baskets, by wholesale, seems to be\r\npretty near the mark. From the wholesale dealers the article sometimes\r\nchanges hands twice, before reaching the consumer, who, taking the\r\naverage, may be said to have paid 3½ cents per basket, or $3.50 per\r\nhundred. Consequently, it will be seen that the retailer makes but a\r\nsmall profit, especially in cases where the strawberries reach him\r\nthrough the hands of the middle-man, who of course manages to make his\r\nshare of gain in the transfer. The wholesale dealers generally sell on\r\ncommission, accounting to the growers for their sales, and reserving ten\r\nper cent. for their trouble. The largest quantity sold by any one dealer\r\nis about 300,000 baskets. The freight charge over the railroads is 12½\r\ncents per hundred baskets.\r\n\r\nThe following figures will show what a conspicuous part this apparently\r\ninsignificant berry plays in our social economics:\r\n\r\n  700,000 baskets, at $3.75 per hundred               $26,250\r\n  Profit to the retailers, at 75 cents per hundred      5,250\r\n  Commission to wholesale dealers, at 10 per cent.      2,625\r\n  Freight, at 12½ cents per hundred, all round            875\r\n\r\nThis is only as far as can be ascertained, but there is reason to\r\nbelieve that thousands of baskets of strawberries find their way into\r\nthe New York markets, of which no account can be obtained, thus tending\r\nto swell the enormous expenditure on this almost the smallest of summer\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nIt is equally difficult to ascertain the quantity of this fruit which\r\npours into Philadelphia also, during the season, but it is probably\r\ntwo-thirds as great as that which goes to New York. There are numerous\r\ngrowers near the former city, who dispatch to it from twenty to sixty\r\nbushels each, daily.\r\n\r\nAn experienced writer on this subject estimates the consumption of\r\nstrawberries in the four great cities as follows--\r\n\r\n  New York              54,000 bushels.\r\n  Philadelphia          14,000    “\r\n  Boston                11,000    “\r\n  Cincinnati            14,000    “\r\n\r\nThis estimate of the consumption of Philadelphia is a very erroneous\r\none, as the consumption must fully equal that of New York. In 1860, no\r\nless than 173,500 quarts of strawberries passed through the gate of only\r\none of the numerous gravel turnpikes in New Jersey, on their way to\r\nPhiladelphia. This is equal to 5,442½ bushels, more than one-third of\r\nthe quantity estimated as above.\r\n\r\nHe says that 8,000,000 baskets (five to the quart) have been received in\r\nNew York in a season. He adds, that the crop around these four cities\r\ndoes not exceed 25 to 50 bushels per acre, although instances are\r\nreported where 100, and even 130 to 140 bushels have been produced on an\r\nacre, or in that proportion. The returns, therefore, vary from $100 to\r\n$800 per acre, and the prices range from $1.50 down to 12½ cents a\r\nquart. The former price is readily obtained in Washington at the opening\r\nof the season.\r\n\r\nHe thence argues that in order to supply New York and vicinity with\r\nstrawberries, about 1,500 acres, of the choicest land is required, and\r\n500 for the other cities named. This he alleges to be at least four\r\ntimes as much land as is either appropriate or necessary for the object,\r\nif the nature and cultivation of the strawberry were only as well\r\nunderstood as the raising of corn. He contends that a crop of thirty\r\nbushels of strawberries to the acre, is only about proportionate to a\r\ncorn crop of ten bushels on the same ground. He says that a strawberry\r\nplantation is seldom seen without having, after the first year, many\r\nmore plants upon the ground than can obtain air or light sufficient to\r\nfruit well. The consequence is, that all our city markets are mainly\r\nsupplied with inferior fruit, simply because some of the commonest kinds\r\ncontinue to produce a little stunted, sour fruit, even under the worst\r\ntreatment. Superior, well-grown fruit will easily produce twice and four\r\ntimes as much to the acre, and will command prices from two to four\r\ntimes larger in the city markets: making the avails and the difference\r\nfrom the same land to be 25 bushels at 12½ cents a quart, or at least\r\n125 bushels at 25 cents a quart, or $1,000 or $100 an acre. He lays it\r\ndown that an acre ought to be made to yield 125 bushels, and that no\r\ngrower should be satisfied with less.\r\n\r\nThat this yield and these profits can be realized, there are numerous\r\nevidences. Small plots of ground, thoroughly cultivated, have yielded\r\neven a double ratio. One grower in Connecticut realized $215 from\r\nstrawberries raised on twenty-five rods of ground, or at the rate of\r\n$1,300 per acre. A citizen of Maine has raised them, on a small lot, at\r\nthe rate of 300 bushels an acre. Another in New Jersey cleared $1,100\r\nfrom three acres, and one of the agricultural societies in that State\r\nawarded the strawberry premium to a gentleman whose ground produced them\r\nat the rate of $1,222 an acre, clear profit. I have seen a crop ripening\r\non three acres for which the owner was offered $800 as it stood, the\r\nbuyer to pick and take it away at his own expense. The offer was\r\ndeclined, and the owner realized $1,300 clear. Mr. Fuller, of Brooklyn,\r\nhas grown at the rate of 600 bushels per acre, on a small plot of the\r\nBartlett; and by the same mode of treatment, 400 of the Triomphe de\r\nGand.\r\n\r\nAll these returns are unquestionably the effects of high culture. Those\r\nwho fail to practise it, also fail to realize such returns. The slovenly\r\ncultivator complains that his strawberries run out. But this is because\r\nhe permits the weeds and grass to run in and occupy the ground. The\r\nplant has no inherent tendency to degenerate. For the last few years,\r\nimmense demand has existed for Wilson’s Albany Seedling. Those at all\r\nconversant with the subject, know that plenty of room is requisite to\r\nget the greatest quantity of runners from a given number of plants--the\r\nsale being perfectly sure, all dealers give this room; the consequence\r\nis, while the plants are worth say $10 per 1000, all are fine large\r\nplants, and give a fair crop, even the first year after planting. Such\r\nplants tell their own story, and the demand continues. In a short time,\r\nprices come down; and the supply increasing beyond demand, the dealer no\r\nlonger thinks it worth while to give this room expressly for the growth\r\nof plants: the beds take care of themselves, hence bear but little, and\r\nthe plants furnished are always weak and spindling. These require the\r\nsecond year to fruit; perhaps, in the interim, new kinds are pressed\r\ninto notice, and from the old beds it becomes more and more difficult to\r\nobtain strong plants, until the cry is raised that the once celebrated\r\nstrawberry has run its race. Now, the question is, whether the same\r\nkinds under the same circumstances, that is, strong runners from strong\r\nold plants, in good soil and plenty of room, will not continue to be\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nAs this is not designed to be a treatise on the art of raising\r\nstrawberries, so I shall not enlarge upon the subject. Every grower\r\nseems to have a method of his own, which he prefers over all others.\r\nThere are works upon the subject, containing numerous facts with which\r\nevery careful beginner should make himself familiar. But even in these\r\nare to be discovered the most extraordinary collisions of opinion,--one,\r\nfor instance, recommending generous manuring, another insisting that\r\npoor ground only should be used, while a third declares that frequent\r\nstirring of the soil will of itself insure abundant crops. Amid all\r\nthese antagonisms one great fact stands prominently forth, that the\r\nstrawberry plant will continue to live and produce fruit under every\r\npossible variety of treatment; while another is equally conspicuous,\r\nthat the better the treatment the better the return. It would be\r\npresumptuous in a novice like me to undertake to reconcile these\r\nunaccountable discrepancies of the great strawberry doctors of the\r\ncountry. But I have learned enough to be satisfied that _soil_ has much\r\nto do in the successful cultivation of this fruit. A variety which\r\nflourishes in one soil will be almost barren in another. Hence, in the\r\nhands of one grower it proves a great prize, but in those of another it\r\nis comparatively worthless. Without doubt it is to this cause that much\r\nof the diversity of opinion as to certain varieties, as well as to the\r\nmode of culture, is to be attributed.\r\n\r\nNeither will I undertake to decide what sorts, among the cloud of new\r\naspirants for public patronage which are annually coming into notice,\r\nare to be adopted as the best. One is in danger of being confused by\r\ngoing largely into the cultivation of a multitude of varieties. Having\r\nsecured a supply of a few which he has proved to be congenial with his\r\nparticular soil, he should adhere to them. Small trials of the new\r\nvarieties may be safely made, but wholesale substitutions are many times\r\ndisastrous undertakings. Having found out such as suit my soil, I am\r\ncontent to keep them. The Albany seedling grows upon it with unsurpassed\r\nluxuriance, and I shall probably never abandon it. Meantime I have tried\r\nthe Bartlett, and found it a rampant and hardy grower, bearing the most\r\nabundant crops of luscious fruit. So I find McAvoy’s Superior to be a\r\nbeautiful berry, and a vigorous runner. In my soil the Triomphe de Gand\r\ndoes not realize the extravagant promise of fruitfulness which heralded\r\nits introduction to public notice. My neighbors also complain of it in\r\nthe same way. But for my own family consumption, I prefer it to any\r\nstrawberry I have ever eaten. The flavor is rich and luscious beyond\r\ndescription, while the crisp seeds crackle between your impatient\r\ngrinders with reverberations loud enough to penetrate the utmost depths\r\nof a hungry stomach. So long as my vines continue to produce only\r\none-fourth as much as others, I shall continue to grow this\r\nunsurpassable variety. It sends off runners in amazing abundance. When\r\ngrown in stools, with the runners clipped off weekly, it bears profusely\r\nof enormous fruit; and this method, I am inclined to believe, is the\r\ntrue corrective of all unfriendly elements in the soil. In addition to\r\nthese, I have, in common with “all the world and the rest of mankind,”\r\nthe Tribune strawberries, now growing finely in pots, and carefully\r\nhoused for crop next summer. Having seen them in fruit, and having also\r\nentire confidence that the association by whom they are distributed\r\nwould no more spread abroad a worthless article than they would\r\ncirculate a vicious sheet, so I regard the propagation of these three\r\nplants as the beginning of a new era in the history of strawberry\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nI have very little doubt that there are specific manures for the\r\nstrawberry, and one of them will probably be found in Baugh’s Rawbone\r\nSuperphosphate of Lime. This article is manufactured in Philadelphia,\r\nand is made of raw, unburnt bones, which in their raw state contain\r\none-third of animal matter, and combines ammonia and phosphoric acid in\r\nthe proper proportions for stimulating and nourishing vegetable growth.\r\nI have used it as freely as I could afford to, on turnips, celery, and\r\nstrawberries. On the two former its effect was very decidedly favorable.\r\nMy celery uniformly exceeds that of my neighbors, both in size,\r\ncrispness, and flavor, and consequently commands a higher price. But its\r\neffect on strawberries has been perfectly marvellous. On some of them\r\nthe superphosphate was scattered on both sides of the row, whence, by\r\nrepeated hoeing and raking, with the aid of sundry rains, its finer\r\nparticles found their way to the roots. The result has been a robust\r\ngrowth of the plants, such as cannot be seen on any other part of my\r\nground. They hold up their heads, their leaves and fruit-stalks some\r\ninches higher than any others, while their whole appearance indicates\r\nthat they have been fed with a more congenial fertilizer than usual.\r\nMany of them have put forth double crowns, showing that they are\r\nprepared to furnish twice the ordinary quantity of fruit. So impressed\r\nam I with the superior value of this fertilizer, that I have, this\r\nautumn of 1863, manured as many rows as I could, and shall hereafter\r\nsubstitute it wholly for all barnyard manure. It is applied with the\r\nutmost facility, it contains the seeds of no pestiferous weeds, and its\r\nvirtues are so highly concentrated that a small amount manures a large\r\nsurface. It is quite possible that it may not do so well on some soils\r\nas others, but no farmer can be sure of this until he has made the\r\ntrial. Hence, as that can be made with a single bag, the sooner it is\r\nundertaken the better it will be for those to whose soil it may be found\r\ncongenial.\r\n\r\nThousands of dollars’ worth of the common wild blackberry are annually\r\ntaken to the cities and sold. For these berries the price has, within a\r\nfew years, actually risen one-half. The traffic in them on some\r\nrailroads is immense, especially on those leading into Philadelphia from\r\nDelaware. Millions of quarts are annually sold in New York and\r\nCincinnati. A single township in New Jersey sells to the amount of\r\n$2,000 and one county in Indiana to that of $10,000. The huckleberry\r\ntrade of New Jersey is also very large. A single buyer in Monmouth\r\ncounty purchases sixty bushels daily during the picking season. All\r\nthese wild berries are gathered by women and children who, without\r\nthese crops, would find no other employment. But they grow in every wood\r\nand swamp, in every neglected headland, while upon the old fields they\r\nenter into full possession. As they cost nothing but the labor of\r\ngathering them, so they are the bountiful means of drawing thousands of\r\ndollars into the pockets of the industrious poor. The cranberry swamps\r\nof New Jersey are as celebrated for the abundance of their products as\r\ntheir owners have been for permitting them to become the prey of all who\r\nchoose to strip them of their fruit.\r\n\r\nThus the demand for even the wild berries continues to enlarge. Hence\r\nthere must be sure sale for those of a superior quality. In fact, the\r\ncultivation of fruit is yet in a state of infancy; it is just beginning\r\nto assume the character its merits deserve. Probably more trees have\r\nbeen raised, more orchards planted, within the past ten or twelve years\r\nthan in all previous time. Within a few years past it has received an\r\nunusual degree of attention. Plantations of all sorts, orchards,\r\ngardens, and nurseries, have increased in number and extent to a degree\r\nquite unprecedented; not in one section or locality, but from the\r\nextreme north to the southern limits of the fruit-growing region.\r\nHorticultural societies have been organized in all parts; while\r\nexhibitions, and National, State, and local Conventions of fruit-growers\r\nhave been held to discuss the merits of fruits, and other kindred\r\ntopics, until it has become the desire of almost every man, whether he\r\nlive in town or country, to enjoy fine fruits, to provide them for his\r\nfamily, and, if possible, to cultivate the trees in his own garden with\r\nhis own hands.\r\n\r\nThere are now single nurseries in this country where a million\r\nfruit-trees are advertised for sale. If every hundred-acre farm were to\r\nreceive fifty trees, all the nurseries would be swept bare in a single\r\nyear. The States east of, and contiguous to, the Mississippi river,\r\nwould require ten thousand acres of land for three hundred years, to\r\nplant ten acres of fruit-trees on every hundred-acre farm in this\r\nportion of the Union: and this estimate is based on the supposition that\r\nall the trees planted do well, and flourish. If only a fifth of them\r\nperish, then two thousand years would be required, at the present rate\r\nof supply, to furnish the above-named quantity of orchard for every\r\nfarm. Some nurseries already cover 300 to 500 acres, but even these go\r\nbut a short way in supplying the immense demand for fruit-trees. How\r\nabsurd, then, in the face of such an array of facts as this, the idea\r\nthat our markets are to be surfeited with fruit! Thousands of acres of\r\npeach-trees, bending under their heavy crops, are still needed for the\r\nconsumption of but one city; and broad fifty-acre fields reddened with\r\nenormous products, may yet send with profit hundreds of bushels of\r\nstrawberries daily into the other. If, instead of keeping three days,\r\nsorts were now added that would keep three months, many times the amount\r\nwould be needed. But the market would not be confined to large cities.\r\nRailroads and steamboats would open new channels of distribution\r\nthroughout the country for increased supplies. Nor would the business\r\nstop here. Large portions of the Eastern Continent would gladly become\r\npurchasers as soon as sufficient quantities should create facilities for\r\na reasonable supply. Our best apples are eagerly bought in London and\r\nLiverpool, where $9 per barrel is not an unusual price for the best\r\nNewtown pippins. And, by being packed in ice, pears gathered early in\r\nautumn have been safely sent to Jamaica, and strawberries to Barbadoes.\r\nThe Baldwin apple has been furnished in good condition in the East\r\nIndies two months after it is entirely gone in Boston. The world has\r\nnever yet been surfeited with fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMAN-FARMING--ESTABLISHING A HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom all these industrial antecedents, few would set me down as\r\nbelonging to the class of gentlemen farmers. Generally they are men of\r\nleisure, and are always presumed to be independent; for most of us have\r\ninherited the strange idea that one must be wealthy in order to be\r\ngentlemanly. They go into the country because they are rich. I went\r\nbecause I was poor. Notwithstanding this antagonism between their\r\ncondition and mine, it was practically, and for all purposes of human\r\ncomfort, so insignificant as to disappear entirely when brought to the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nThere were neighbors within a mile of me, wealthy citizens who had\r\npurchased lands, erected splendid houses, established lawns that were\r\ngorgeous with fruits, and evergreens and flowers, while costly graperies\r\nwere made to yield a winter harvest of extraordinary fruit. They sported\r\nelegant carriages, and had professional experts to look after the\r\nhot-beds in winter, and the garden in summer. My riding was done a-foot,\r\nand I was the professional genius of my own garden. Every avenue of\r\ntheirs was nicely gravelled and rolled; every hedge of evergreen was\r\ntrimmed into the most artistic shape. Not a day in winter but the\r\nvegetables of early spring were spread in abundance on their tables;\r\nyet many times they have overflowed with generous attention on my own.\r\n\r\nI could boast of but few of these ever-present luxuries; yet with these\r\nmen, some of whom were the life and charm of the neighborhood, I mingled\r\nwith the most cordial association. Though there was no community of\r\nwealth, yet there was one of feeling, such as springs from education,\r\ncharacter, and kindred aspirations after whatever is captivating in the\r\nintellectual, or good in the moral world. Our families became cemented\r\nby cordial friendships, and intercourse was enjoyed and regulated, not\r\non the assumption that it was money that made the country gentleman, but\r\nthat mind, and heart, and education were the true ingredients. Thus,\r\nwith no pretensions to a position so widely coveted, I enjoyed all its\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nThere is no such leveller as politics, short of the great leveller\r\nhimself. Some of my neighbors were prodigious politicians. As most of\r\nthem were sensible men, all such agreed with me; and having myself a\r\ngood deal of zeal in the cause, we had at times a world of caucussing;\r\non which occasions the most luminous discussions occurred. I have\r\nsometimes been astonished at the depth of political and financial wisdom\r\ndeveloped on these occasions. There was little doubt, in my mind, that a\r\ncabinet of the strongest character could have been made up from among\r\nus. When I hinted this idea to one of us, he expressed his decided\r\nopinion that there was material enough for two or three. As to\r\nfinance--for most of these had been successful and become rich--they\r\ntalked of hundreds of millions as if they were every-day trifles. These\r\ncaucusses occupied many long evenings just before election-day, when\r\nfunds were to raise, candidates to be selected, tickets to print, and\r\nother equally weighty matters were to be engineered to a crisis.\r\nSometimes, even after election, they were held, especially when it was\r\ndiscovered that the funds had been used up without expenses having been\r\npaid. On such occasions it was evident we had much less talk and fire,\r\nand that the cash deficit was a considerable damper on the spirits of\r\nall present. But I feel convinced that at these caucuses the nation has\r\nbeen repeatedly saved. As we generally carried the day at the polls, it\r\nwas then unanimously agreed on “our side” that the country was safe--at\r\nleast until it needed saving over again.\r\n\r\nSomehow--I can hardly say exactly how--these gentlemen discovered that I\r\nwas pretty good at writing resolutions, getting up posters that made the\r\ntown ring with sensation, and that in a general way I was what one of\r\nthe party--a retired grocer--called a “good egg.” The result was that I\r\nwas speedily promoted to a high position in their political and social\r\nconfidence. On one occasion they even did me the honor of making me\r\nsecretary of a meeting which had been called to consider what had better\r\nbe done with the town pump; and I have good reason to believe that had I\r\nintimated a wish to that effect, they would have honored me with the\r\nextremely responsible position of chairman. If the country had been in\r\nany actual danger, I think they would have turned to me by a sort of\r\ninstinct, so great was their admiration of my ability to get up a\r\nhandbill at the shortest possible notice. But having no political\r\nambition, the security in which I have been content to vegetate will not\r\nsurprise the sympathetic reader. Thus village politics are a very\r\nagreeable pastime, especially when you happen to be generally of the\r\nsame mind.\r\n\r\nSome of these country gentlemen had purchased naked fields, inclosed by\r\ndecrepit fences, over which the rank poison-vine and poke-bush struggled\r\nwith the wild blackberry for ascendancy, while the weather-beaten trunks\r\nof blasted apple-trees, grown ghastly by age and decay, threw up their\r\nleafless branches in the centre of the grounds. There were stones and\r\ngulleys and barren knolls denuded of the soil. There were ponds which\r\nstagnated in summer, overgrown with spatter-docks and cat-tail, and so\r\ndensely populated by frogs, that even when times were most flourishing\r\nand money most abundant, the neighborhood was never without its\r\ncongregation of croakers. The buildings were in some cases the\r\narchitectural residuum of the men who first squatted on the soil, with\r\nlow and unplastered ceilings, blackened by the smoke from huge open\r\nfireplaces. As every thing within was primitive and inconvenient, so all\r\nwithout was rude and squalid.\r\n\r\nIt has everywhere been the mission of the gentleman farmer to\r\nreconstruct and regenerate all this. I have seen him engaged in\r\nnumberless undertakings of the kind. No one begins improvement with\r\nsuch courageous zeal; no one goes through with what he undertakes with\r\nsuch unflagging liberality of expenditure. Wherever he locates he leaves\r\nan almost imperishable mark. Whatever he lays his hand to he improves\r\nand beautifies.\r\n\r\nAll this is proverbial in the country, though the zeal, the efforts, and\r\nthe expenditures of such men are far from being properly appreciated. I\r\nwas one day standing near an old homestead, which was thus crumbling\r\ninto a heap of firewood, by order of a wealthy citizen who had recently\r\nbecome the purchaser. A group of idle neighbors were leaning, like\r\nmyself, against the old rickety fence, watching the progress of\r\ndemolition, when an ancient farmer, who knew nothing beyond six per\r\ncent., broke the silence by observing--\r\n\r\n“So it is. When a city man buys a farm and pays for it, then he begins\r\nto spend money.”\r\n\r\n“Always so,” responded another, who belonged to the same antediluvian\r\nclass; “I’ve seed it many a time.”\r\n\r\nThere was quite a general assent to this proposition among the group.\r\nThe idea of the first speaker was, that because he possessed money, his\r\nsole duty was to keep it, and that gentlemen farmers were great\r\nsimpletons for doing otherwise; never for a moment imagining that if for\r\nhimself it were a luxury to hoard, it might be with the others a still\r\ngreater luxury to spend.\r\n\r\nIn many neighborhoods, the advent of a gentleman farmer is not hailed\r\nwith genuine hospitality. He is too often regarded as a foolish man,\r\nbecause he spends his money freely, even though it be scattered among\r\nthe sneering crowd. However thoroughly he pulls down, however\r\njudiciously he builds up and improves, the masses neither appreciate nor\r\ncomprehend. They see him exterminate the most impenetrable hedgerows\r\nwith no other remark than as to what the job will cost. He drains the\r\nimmemorial marsh, abolishes the spatter-docks, squelches the frogs, digs\r\nup the dead apple-trees, and brings in a huge stand of clover. The\r\nlatter they can comprehend, because they know what clover is. They have\r\nbeen educated to believe in it; but of most of the former operations\r\nthey know nothing, and having a vague idea that they cost great sums of\r\nmoney, condemn them as useless and unprofitable fancies.\r\n\r\nBut among the gentlemen farmers of this country are to be found its\r\nloftiest minds, its purest patriots, its greatest public benefactors.\r\nThey have imported our celebrated breeds of domestic animals, sometimes\r\nat enormous cost, and in many cases have propagated them with no view to\r\ntheir own profit. The farm-stock of entire neighborhoods has been\r\nregenerated by this infusion of new and better blood. They build neater\r\nand more convenient barns and outhouses; they patronize new plants and\r\ntools; they ditch and under-drain the swamps and meadows; they plant\r\nvast orchards of the choicest fruits; they try costly experiments\r\nexclusively for the public good; their labors enhance the value of the\r\nlands around them; they are the animating spirits of half our\r\nagricultural societies, and, in a hundred ways, by precept and example,\r\nwith a generous outlay of means, have made themselves the models of\r\nimproved processes which have acted powerfully in inducing others to\r\nimitate their management.\r\n\r\nYet these men are sometimes pitied because their labors afford them no\r\nprofit, as if the whole duty of man lay in the acquisition of six per\r\ncent. It is not important that their labor should result in profit; and\r\nif of no consequence to themselves, why should their failure to realize\r\nit be so distressing to others? It would cost them quite as much to live\r\nif they had remained in the city. The only real money difference is,\r\nthat what they spend is disbursed in one place instead of another. There\r\nis the vast collateral gratification of living where the most comfort is\r\nto be obtained. They have tramped and sweltered over the hot pavements\r\nof a city long enough. Now they have broad acres and health-inspiring\r\nbreezes, glorious lawns, trees loaded with abundant crops of luscious\r\nfruit, gardens whose contents would be coveted by the tenants of every\r\ncity market, society enough, books, and whatever they may order the\r\ndaily mail to bring them. It is perhaps the most valuable incident in\r\nthe whole aim and practice of gentleman farming that profit is not the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nBut if these establish pleasant homes by restoring the waste places of\r\nthe earth, it is not accomplished by merely scattering at random the\r\ncontents of a well-filled purse. Taste and inclination must combine to\r\nmake the whole effort effective. Take these two last ingredients,\r\nsubstitute industry and economy for the purse, and then unite all in the\r\nperson of a persevering man, penniless though he be, and a home may be\r\nestablished, less pretentious, it is true, but within which Love will\r\ngladly seek to fold his wings, evermore to nestle round the heart, while\r\nTime, sure in his approaches, but lavish of his compensations, will lift\r\nup the modest occupants into the sunshine of a grateful independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nUNSUCCESSFUL MEN--REBELLION NOT RUINOUS TO NORTHERN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back upon the incidents of my city life, I confess that\r\nincreasing years bring with them an increasing respect for those who do\r\nnot succeed in life, as these words are commonly used. Heaven has been\r\nsaid to be a place for those who have not succeeded upon earth; and it\r\nis surely true that celestial graces do not best thrive and bloom in the\r\nhot blaze of worldly prosperity. Ill success sometimes arises from\r\nsuperabundance of qualities in themselves good, from a conscience too\r\nsensitive, a taste too fastidious, a self-forgetfulness too romantic, a\r\nmodesty too retiring. I will not go so far as to say, with a living\r\npoet, that\r\n\r\n    “The world knows nothing of its greatest men;”\r\n\r\nbut there are forms of greatness, or at least excellence, that die and\r\nmake no sign; there are martyrs who miss the palm, but not the stake;\r\nthere are heroes without the laurel, and conquerors without the triumph.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there is a class of men who never succeed in\r\nbusiness. With a fair amount of earnest industry, they are still unable\r\nto get on. Bad luck seems to be their fate, and they are perpetually\r\nrailing at fortune. In this they are not without sympathy. There are\r\nhundreds of simple, good-hearted people, who regard them as ill-starred\r\nmortals, against whom an inscrutable destiny had set itself, and who are\r\nalways ready to pity their mischances and help them in their last\r\nextremity. But is not that a very foolish philosophy which refers the\r\nmisfortunes or the prosperity of individuals to preternatural causes, or\r\neven natural causes entirely foreign to the persons? Some people, it is\r\ntrue, owe a great deal to accident. Much of their success is due to\r\ncircumstances not of their own making. So it is with others who suffer\r\ndisappointment or disaster. But in those cases in which failure or\r\nsuccess is certainly dependent on no extraneous agencies, but on one’s\r\nown means and energies, I am confident that no little of the complaint\r\nof our hard lot is misdirected, and that the charity which helps us out\r\nof our successive difficulties is misplaced. In plain words, our\r\nfailures in this or that thing are often attributable to the fact that\r\nwe engage in enterprises beyond our power. The world is filled with\r\nexamples of this truth. We see hundreds of men in all professions and\r\ncallings who never achieve even a decent living. The bar of every city\r\nis crowded with them. They swell the ranks of our physicians and\r\ntheologians, and swarm in the walks of science and literature; in short,\r\nthey run against and elbow you everywhere. They are the unfortunate\r\npeople who have mistaken their mission. They are always attempting tasks\r\nwhich they have not the first qualification to perform. Their ambition\r\nis forever outrunning their capabilities. They fancy that to call\r\nthemselves lawyers, doctors, divines, or the like, is to be what they\r\nare styled. Their signs are stuck thickly on doors and shutters all over\r\nthe city, but they are without honor or employment. Of course they never\r\nprosper. They have no fitness for their vocation, no practical skill, no\r\nnatural talent, and hence they fail.\r\n\r\nBut both they and society are losers by this. There is so much real\r\nability for something useful that is thus sunk and wasted. The community\r\nis encumbered with a host of very incompetent barristers, preachers,\r\nphysicians, writers, merchants, and so forth, and is deprived of as many\r\ngood mechanics, and farmers, and laborers. What a pity it is that men\r\nwill not be content to choose their pursuits according to their\r\nabilities. To encourage them to persist in any business for which they\r\nare not suited, and in which they never can obtain fortune or credit, is\r\nreally unkind. It would be much less cruel to let them early feel the\r\ninconveniences of following a calling for which they are unfit, and go\r\ninto one for which nature may have given them the requisite aptitude and\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nBut, in the ordering of a good Providence, failure in one pursuit does\r\nnot imply failure in the next. I know and have proved this. The motto\r\nshould be to keep moving, to try it again. Try it a hundred times, if\r\nyou do not earlier succeed, and all the while be studying to see if you\r\nhave not failed through some negligence and oversight of your own. Do\r\nnot throw down your oars and drift stern foremost, because the tide\r\nhappens to be against you. The tide does not always run the same way.\r\nNever anchor because the wind does not happen to be fair. Beat to\r\nwindward, and gain all you can until it changes. If you get to the\r\nbottom of the wheel, hold on--never think of letting go. Let it move\r\nwhich way it will, you are sure to go up.\r\n\r\nIf in debt, do not let time wear off the edge of the obligation.\r\nEconomize, work harder, spend less, and hurry out. If misfortune should\r\novertake you, do not sit down and mope, and let her walk over you. Put\r\non more steam, drive ahead, and get out of the way. If you meet\r\nobstacles in your path, climb over, dig under, or go around them--never\r\nturn back. If the day be stormy, you cannot mend matters by whining and\r\ncomplaining. Be good-natured, take it easy, for assuredly the sun will\r\nshine to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIf you lose money on a promising speculation, never think of collecting\r\na coroner’s inquest about your dead body. Do not put on a long face\r\nbecause money is not so plentiful as usual--it will not add a single\r\ndollar to the circulating medium. Preserve your good-humor, for there is\r\nmore health in a single hearty laugh than in a dozen glasses of rum. Be\r\nhappy, and impart happiness to others. Look aloft, and trust in God. Be\r\nprudent as you please, but do not bleach out your hair, and pucker your\r\nface into wrinkles ten years ahead of time, by a self-inflicted fit of\r\nthe dismals.\r\n\r\nI went into the country with a determination to succeed. As others had\r\nthere succeeded, I could not be induced to believe that failure in so\r\nsimple an enterprise could overtake me, as I felt myself quite as\r\ncompetent as they. A resolute will overcomes all difficulties. It was\r\none of the leading characteristics of Napoleon to regard nothing as\r\nimpossible. His astonishing successes are to be attributed to his\r\nindomitable will, scarcely less than to his vast military genius.\r\nWellington was distinguished for a similar peculiarity. The entire\r\nPeninsular campaign was, indeed, but one long display of an iron will,\r\nresolute to conquer difficulties by wearing them out. Alexander the\r\nGreat was quite as striking an example of what a powerful will can\r\neffect. His stubborn determination to subdue the Persians; his\r\nperseverance in the crisis of battle, and the emulation to which he thus\r\nstimulated his officers and men, did more for his wonderful career of\r\nvictory than even his great strategic abilities. In the life and death\r\nstruggle between England and France, during the first fifteen years of\r\nthis century, it was the stubborn will of the former which carried the\r\nday; for though Napoleon defeated the British coalitions again and\r\nagain, yet new ones were as constantly formed, until at last the French\r\npeople, if not their emperor, were completely worn out. The battle of\r\nWaterloo, which was the climax of this tremendous struggle, was also an\r\nillustration of the sustained energy, the superior will of the British.\r\nIn that awful struggle, French impetuosity proved too weak for English\r\nresolution. “We will see who can pound the longest,” said Wellington;\r\nand as the British did, they won the battle.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in military chieftains that a strong will is a jewel of\r\ngreat price. Nations and individuals experience the advantages of a\r\nresolute will; and this alike in large and small undertakings. It was\r\nthe determined will of our forefathers to which, with divine help, we\r\nare principally indebted for our freedom. For the first few years after\r\nthe declaration of independence, we lost most of the battles that were\r\nfought. New York and Philadelphia were successively captured by the foe;\r\nSouth Carolina fell; New Jersey was practically reannexed to England;\r\nalmost every thing went against us. Had the American people been feeble\r\nand hesitating, all would have been lost. But they resolved to conquer\r\nor die. Though their cities were taken, their fields ravaged, and their\r\ncaptured soldiers incarcerated in hideous prison-ships, they still\r\nmaintained the struggle, making the pilgrimage of freedom with naked\r\nfeet, that bled at every step. Had our fathers been incapable of Valley\r\nForge, had they shrunk from the storm-beaten march on Trenton, we should\r\nnever have been an independent nation. There are people in the Old\r\nWorld, full of genius and enthusiasm for liberty, who yet cannot achieve\r\nfreedom, principally, perhaps, because they lack the indomitable will to\r\nwalk the bloody pilgrimage. The outbreak of the slaveholders’ rebellion\r\ncovered the Union armies with defeat at numerous points, because\r\nrebellions are always successful at the beginning. But the determined\r\nwill to crush out treason will eventually overwhelm and master it.\r\n\r\nA strong will is as necessary to the individual as to the nation. Even\r\nintellect is secondary in importance to will. A vacillating man, no\r\nmatter what his abilities, is invariably pushed aside, in the race of\r\nlife, by the man of determination. It is he who resolves to succeed, who\r\nbegins resolutely again at every fresh rebuff, that reaches the goal.\r\nThe shores of fortune are covered with the stranded wrecks of business\r\nmen who have wasted energy, and therefore courage and faith, and have\r\nperished in sight of more resolute but less capable adventurers, who\r\nsucceeded in making port. In fact, talent without will is like steam\r\ndissipating itself in the atmosphere; while abilities controlled by\r\nenergy are the same steam brought under subjection as a motive power. Or\r\nwill is the rudder that steers the ship, which, whether a fast-sailing\r\nclipper or a slow river-barge, is worthless without it. Talent, again,\r\nis but the sail; will is what drives it. The man without a will is the\r\npuppet and bubble of others by turns. The man with a will is the one\r\nthat pulls the strings and catches the dupes. Young man, starting out in\r\nlife, have a will of your own. If you do not, you will drag along, the\r\nvictim of perpetual embarrassment, only to end in utter ruin. If you do,\r\nyou will succeed, even though your abilities be moderate.\r\n\r\nAll this may be viewed as a digression. But it is not so. I do not write\r\nfor the rich and prosperous, but for those who have been unsuccessful.\r\nThey need encouragement and bracing up. If their experience has been\r\ndisastrous, that of others, who have succeeded, should be set before\r\nthem. Some fifty years ago there lived in this city an old man, who by\r\ndint of tact, with the aid of keen perceptive faculties, had acquired\r\nmuch celebrity with a large class of his neighbors as something between\r\na prophet and a fortune-teller. He did not, however, assume the\r\ncharacter either of a religious fanatic or of a crafty disciple of\r\nFaustus. But he was well read in the Scriptures; he had a good share of\r\ncommon sense, and a voluble tongue, and by degrees he attained a fame\r\nfor wise sayings and for capability to advise, which he owed more to his\r\nnatural talents and a loquacious disposition than to any less worthy\r\nmeans. Being advanced in years, and his lot humble, he turned the good\r\nopinion formed of him to the account of his livelihood, by discussing\r\nquestions put to him by his visitors in a frank and manly spirit; and\r\nwithout ever demanding recompense, he was ready to receive any gratuity\r\nthat was offered by them on their departure. Moreover, his advice was\r\nalways, if not valuable, at least good in kind; and few quitted his\r\nhumble dwelling without leaving their good wishes in a substantial\r\nshape, or without having also formed a favorable opinion of their\r\nmentor.\r\n\r\nAt length, so extensive did this good man’s fame become, that many from\r\ncuriosity alone were induced to visit him, and hear his wise sayings.\r\nHis counsel was usually couched in short and terse sentences, frequently\r\nin proverbs, and often in the language of the Bible, to which he would\r\nsometimes refer his inquirers for passages which he said would be found\r\napplicable to their case. As these passages were usually selected from\r\nthe Proverbs, and other books of somewhat similar description, which\r\ncontained some rule of morals, or which advocated the Christian duties,\r\nhe seldom failed to be right. Among others who were led by curiosity to\r\nthis wise man, was a young farmer, then not long entered upon the\r\nthreshold of life, whom, after some of the Scripture references adverted\r\nto, he dismissed with the parting advice, “To keep a smiling\r\ncountenance, and a good exertion.” The young farmer lived to become an\r\nold man, and is now gathered to his fathers. But for many years I heard\r\nhim from time to time revert with pleasure to his visit, and say that\r\nthis simple aphorism had frequently cheered him in the hour of\r\ndifficulty; and that the thought of the old man’s contented countenance\r\nand encouraging voice when he uttered it, had gone far to make him place\r\nconfidence in his counsel.\r\n\r\nWe are all too prone to brood over the clouds upon our atmosphere, and\r\ntoo feebly do we keep the eye of hope fixed on the first sunbeam which\r\nbreaks through as the symbol of their dispersion. In reality, most of\r\nthem are merely passing clouds. Some glances at a blacker picture still,\r\nwill go far to clothe with brighter hues the less gloomy picture which\r\nmay happen to be our own. Thus, with “a smiling countenance and a good\r\nexertion,” let every one of us whether his lot be cast with the plough,\r\nthe loom, or the anvil, put forth manfully his powers, and, thankful to\r\na gracious God for the blessings yet spared, be it our effort in our\r\nworldly duties to follow the example set us in higher things,\r\n“forgetting those things that are behind, and reaching forth unto those\r\nwhich are before, let us press towards the mark for the prize;” and if\r\nwe thus demean ourselves, we shall not fail, in earthly any more than in\r\nspiritual things, to obtain our reward.\r\n\r\nAll know that one effect of the rebellion was to paralyze nearly every\r\nkind of business, suddenly enriching the few, but as suddenly\r\nimpoverishing the many. On my quiet little plantation I was entirely\r\nbeyond the reach of its disastrous influence. It lost me no money,\r\nbecause my savings had been loaned on mortgage. It is true that interest\r\nwas not paid up as punctually as aforetime, but the omission to pay\r\noccasioned me no distress; hence I occasioned none by compulsory\r\ncollection. The summer of 1861, however, did reduce prices of most of my\r\nproductions. The masses had less money to spend, and therefore consumed\r\nless. Yet my early consignments of blackberries sold for twenty-five\r\ncents a quart, and the whole crop averaged fourteen. My strawberries\r\nyielded abundantly, escaping the frost which nipped the first bloom of\r\nall other growers, no doubt protected by the well-grown peach-trees, and\r\nnetted me sixteen cents. Raspberries bore generously, and netted quite\r\nas much; while peaches, though few in number, brought the highest\r\nprices. The total income that year was certainly less than usual, by\r\nseveral hundred dollars--but what of that? It was double what I needed\r\nto support my family. Thus no national disaster, no matter how\r\ntremendous, seems able to impoverish the farmer who is free from debt.\r\nNothing short of the tramp of hostile armies over his green fields can\r\nimpoverish such a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nWHERE TO LOCATE--EAST OR WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery great national calamity has the effect of driving men from the\r\ncities to engage in agriculture. Such has been the result of the late\r\nwar for the Union. I have been in a position to observe its operation on\r\nthe minds of hundreds whom it covered with disaster. There has been the\r\nusual desire to break away from the cities, and settle in the country.\r\nThe life-long convictions of my own mind have taken possession of the\r\nminds of others. Property in the cities ceased, for a time, to be\r\nsalable, while farms have been in more general demand than for years\r\npast. Foreign immigration was measurably stopped, because men fly from\r\nconvulsions, not to countries where they are to be encountered. When war\r\ndesolates the nations of Europe, the people migrate hither to avoid its\r\nhorrors; when it desolates ours, they remain at home.\r\n\r\nDuring the late disastrous experiences of city life, many of my friends\r\nupon whom they fell with great severity were free in their\r\ncongratulations on my happy change of life. They had been as free in\r\ndoubting the propriety of my experiment. Now, however, they looked up to\r\nme as possessing superior sagacity; were desirous themselves of\r\nimitating my example, and sought instruction and advice as to how they\r\nshould proceed. Three of them are already located near me; so that,\r\ninstead of cutting entirely loose from old associates by coming into the\r\ncountry, I have attracted them into a closer intimacy than ever. Dear as\r\nmy home was without them, it is rendered doubly dearer by close\r\nassociation with long-tried friends.\r\n\r\nLocation is perhaps the most important consideration. A cash market all\r\nthe year round for every variety of produce that a man can raise, is of\r\nthe utmost importance to secure. Such is invariably to be found in close\r\nproximity to the great cities; and there, singularly enough, the\r\nwealthiest farmers in the Union will generally be found. When we go to\r\nthe extreme North, where their market is limited, and where they produce\r\nonly the heavy grains, and grasses, farming is so little an object that\r\nimproved places can always be bought for less than their cost. It is\r\nvery frequently the same throughout the West, where so much that is\r\nraised upon a farm is valueless; and where, for even the grains, they\r\nhave a market which barely pays the expense of living. The expense\r\nincurred in farming can be regulated by the profit of the crops; and\r\nwhere even no manure is required, the labor has to be expended, and\r\ncrops in distant localities often fail to pay the expense of this labor.\r\nWhere land will pay for a liberal cultivation, as well as fertilizing,\r\nit is much better, as a farmer must work his stock, and a certain amount\r\nof care is indispensable. The difference in value existing between those\r\nfarms near a market and those remote from it, is enormous. If the mind\r\nwill consider the immense amount of produce in the way of fruits and\r\nvegetables which, near a city, will command the highest prices, and\r\nwhich at a distance are an entire loss, a conception can be readily\r\nformed of what they amount to in dollars and cents.\r\n\r\nLand in Illinois and Iowa can be purchased for a dollar an acre, but\r\ncorn is at times of so little value as to be consumed for fuel. The\r\nwheat crop is annually decreasing in its acreable product, because no\r\none values or applies manure. The West may be the paradise of the\r\nEuropean immigrant, who, having abandoned friends and home, may with\r\npropriety settle in one spot as well as in another; because, go where he\r\nwill, he will be sure to find none but strangers. But for residents of\r\nour cities who go thither, very few acquire property by legitimate\r\nfarming, even after sacrificing all the tender associations of relatives\r\nand friends whom they leave behind, and enduring hardships and trials of\r\ndouble severity with those they need encounter if they would consent to\r\nsuffer them on lands within thirty miles of their birthplace. If they\r\nbecome rich, it is by hazardous speculation, or by the rise in value of\r\ntheir lands. So far as real, practical farming is concerned, it will be\r\nfound that the East is incomparably superior to the West; but, so far as\r\nsmall farmers like myself are concerned, it would be folly to deny this\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nI say nothing as to the superior ease with which corn and wheat are\r\nproduced in the two sections, but refer only to the amount of money that\r\ncan be realized from an acre there and an acre here. Beyond question,\r\nthere are certain crops that are produced with greater ease in the West\r\nthan in the East; but of what value is this superior facility if it does\r\nnot pay? I have cleared from a single acre of tomatoes more than enough\r\nto buy a hundred and sixty acres in Iowa. If I had located there, who\r\nwould have been ready to buy my abundant crop of berries? The truth is,\r\nthat it is population that gives value to land,--population either on it\r\nor around it,--to convert it into lots covered with buildings, or to\r\nconsume whatever it may produce. The West is a glorious region for the\r\nforeign immigrant, or for him who was born upon the rugged hill-sides of\r\nthe Eastern States, but it is not the proper location for the class for\r\nwhose instruction these pages have been written.\r\n\r\nFew persons who have been nurtured and educated all their days in\r\nEastern cities, and who have probably never been more than fifty miles\r\nfrom home, have any correct idea of what this gigantic West really is\r\nuntil they reach the spot itself. Why leave the privileges of a\r\nlong-established civilization,--the schools, the churches of home,--the\r\ndaily intercourse of acquaintances and friends,--merely because land\r\nproducing twenty bushels of wheat per acre can be purchased for a\r\ndollar, when that producing twenty times as much in fruit or vegetables\r\ncan be had for fifty, and often even for less? I doubt not there must be\r\nmany in that region who now wish themselves back in their old homes.\r\n\r\nIf my example be worth imitating, land should be obtained within cheap\r\nand daily access to any one of the great cities. If within reach of\r\ntwo, as mine is, all the better, as the location thus secures the choice\r\nof two markets. In Pennsylvania, all the land around Philadelphia is\r\nheld at high prices. Much of it is divided into small holdings, many of\r\nwhich are rented to market gardeners at prices so high that none but\r\nmarket gardeners can afford to pay them. Others are worked by their\r\nowners, who live well by feeding the great city. Gradually, as the city\r\nextends in every direction, these small holdings are given up to streets\r\nand buildings, thus enriching their owners by the rise in value. The\r\ntruckers move further back, where land is cheaper. But the modern\r\nfacilities for reaching the city by railroad have so greatly multiplied,\r\nthat they are practically as near to it as they were before. The yield\r\nfrom some of these small holdings is very large. But the cost of land\r\nthus situated was too great for my slender capital when I began.\r\n\r\nHence I sought a location in New Jersey. There unimproved land, within\r\nan hour of Philadelphia, can be purchased for the same money per acre\r\nwhich is paid in Pennsylvania as annual rent. For ten to twenty dollars\r\nmore, in clearing up and improving, it can be made immediately\r\nproductive, as the soil of even this cheap land is far more fertile than\r\nis generally supposed. Thousands of acres of this description are always\r\nfor sale, and thousands are annually being bought and improved, as\r\nrailroads and turnpikes leading to the city are being established. Many\r\nGermans have abandoned the West, and opened farms on this cheap and\r\nadmirably located land, from which they raise prodigious quantities of\r\nfruit and truck for Philadelphia and New York.\r\n\r\nColonies of New Englanders, allured by the early season, as compared\r\nwith that of their own homes, the productive soil and the ready access\r\nto market, have settled upon and around the new railroad just opened,\r\nwhich leads south from Camden through the town of Malaga, where a large\r\ntract has recently been divided into farms of various sizes. They bring\r\nwith them all the surroundings of an advanced civilization.\r\n\r\nTo those with no capital but their own labor and a determination to\r\nconquer success, these lands offer the highest inducements. Most of them\r\ncan be had on credit, by men who will settle and improve, at twenty to\r\nthirty dollars per acre, within a little over an hour’s ride to\r\nPhiladelphia. This tract is distant but a few miles from the Delaware\r\nriver, and probably no better could be found. Any number of locations\r\ncan be had. Many are already improved by buildings, fencing, and all the\r\npreliminary comforts which cluster round an established home. The\r\nsettler may choose between the improved and the unimproved.\r\n\r\nBut there is a better country north of Camden, lining the shore of the\r\nDelaware, where any number of locations may be found, improved by\r\nbuildings, and at moderate prices, as well as on favorable terms as to\r\npayment. Vast progress in improvement has been made through all this\r\nregion within ten years. New towns have been built, new turnpikes\r\nconstructed, while the great railroad puts the cultivator in constant\r\nconnection with the two overgrown cities at its termini. Land is\r\nincreasing in value as population flows in. The margin of the Delaware,\r\nfrom Philadelphia upward, is being lined with villages, between which\r\nnew farm-houses and cottages are annually erected; and the young of this\r\ngeneration will live to see it a continuous settlement of substantial\r\nvillas, peopled by the swarms of educated families which a great human\r\nhive like Philadelphia is annually throwing off. A location within such\r\nan atmosphere of improvement must continually increase in value. The\r\nowner will find himself growing richer from this cause, just as the\r\ntrucker on the Pennsylvania side has done--not so rapidly, but quite as\r\nsurely. An investment in such land, properly managed, and not permitted\r\nto deteriorate, will assuredly pay. My own little farm is an\r\nillustration; for more than once have I been solicited to sell at double\r\nthe price it cost me.\r\n\r\nI am now looking at the future, as well as at the present. Yet the\r\napparent anomaly of there being always an abundance of land for sale in\r\nso desirable a district, must not be overlooked. But it is so throughout\r\nour country; there are always and everywhere more sellers than buyers.\r\nIt is the same thing in the cities; everywhere there is somebody anxious\r\nto sell. It would seem that we either have too much land in this\r\ncountry, or too small a population. Time alone can produce the proper\r\nequilibrium. The land cannot be increased in quantity, but it is evident\r\nthat the population will be. As this is not a treatise either upon land\r\nor farming, but the experience of a single individual, so each claimant\r\nfor a similar experience must choose for himself.\r\n\r\nBut choose as he may, locate as he will, he must not, as he hopes to\r\nsucceed in growing the smaller fruits to profit, locate himself out of\r\nreach of a daily cash market. New York and Philadelphia may be likened\r\nto two huge bags of gold, always filled, and ever standing open for him\r\nto thrust in his hand, provided in the other he brings something to eat.\r\nFrom this exhaustless fountain of wealth, whole adjacent populations\r\nhave become rich. The appetite of the cities for horticultural luxuries\r\nhas revolutionized the neighboring agriculture, enhanced the value of\r\nthousands of acres, infused a higher spirit into cultivators, elevated\r\nfruit-growing into a science, and started competition in a long rivalry\r\nafter the best of every thing that the earth can be made to yield. All\r\nthis is no spasmodic movement. It will go on for all future time; but in\r\nthis grand and humanizing march after perfection in producing food for\r\nman, the careful tiller of the soil, with moderate views and thankful\r\nheart, will be sure to find TEN ACRES ENOUGH.\r\n\r\n                               THE END.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nimportation from distant countries=> importation form distant countries\r\n{pg 96}\r\n\r\nfifty cents’ worths=> fifty cents’ worth {pg 215}\r\n\r\nworst treatmeut=> worst treatment {pg 221}\r\n\r\nDo not put on long a face=> Do not put on a long face {pg 241}",
