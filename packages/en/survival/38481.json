The\r\nconstruction of the machine, the capacity of which differs according\r\nto the amount of power required, will readily be understood from the\r\nillustration. Above the air cylinder are two distinct air chambers,\r\neach having two induction or receiving valves, which cushion on\r\nrubbers. With the movement of the piston these chambers alternately\r\nreceive and force the compressed air through check valves placed\r\nin the upper part of the air compartment, both compartments being\r\nconnected with one pipe conveying the air to the ordinary air\r\nreceiver. These check valves lift alternately, and cushion on water;\r\nand as the compressed air is forced into the pipe connecting with the\r\nreceiver, without a possibility of any of it escaping back into the\r\nreceiving chambers, it is claimed that there is the smallest possible\r\nloss of power, and that the machine will give fully 90 per cent of\r\nsteam power expended in the shape of compressed air. The compressor is\r\ncompact in form, strongly made, simple in construction, and not liable\r\nto get out of order. One peculiarity in its construction is that no\r\nwater jacket or hollow piston is used; yet under any of the extreme\r\npressures to which the machine has been tested, no inconvenience, we\r\nare informed, from heat has been perceptible.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the compressor, receivers of various sizes are\r\nused, into which the air is pumped and thence conveyed by pipe to the\r\nlocation where required, even if it be a mile or more, the loss by\r\nfriction between receiver and point of utilization of the air being,\r\nit is claimed, under 2 lbs. of the pressure.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers also build water-power compressors, one of which,\r\ndriven by 75 to 100 horse power, they have recently shipped to Utah.\r\nThe machine is intended to convey the air through iron tubes 5,000\r\nfeet to the mouth of a silver mine, where a 50 horse power hoisting\r\nand a 25 horse power pumping engine will be driven by air instead\r\nof steam, and a tube will be extended into the mine 1,000 feet deep,\r\nwhere the power drills and small pumps will be operated by air also.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturers submit a number of excellent testimonials from\r\nparties using the machine. From one, we learn, that at the Antelope\r\nand Prince of Wales mine, near Alta City, Utah, the compressor runs 10\r\nhours per day, and supplies compressed air to two 3 inch drills used\r\nin running levels. The distribution terminates at distances of from\r\n1,000 to 2,000 feet from the compressor. The machine also drives one\r\nhoisting engine and ventilates the lower part of the mine. The main\r\nsupply pipe is three inches in diameter, 2,300 feet long, and is\r\ntapped by two inch pipe wherever power is required. The expenditure\r\nof fuel is one cord of green pine wood and 600 lbs. of bituminous\r\ncoal per 10 hours. Air pressure in receiver 100 lbs. This pressure\r\nis reported to be obtained by 70 lbs. of steam as indicated by the\r\ngauges.\r\n\r\nFor further particulars, address the manufacturers, Messrs. Griffith\r\nand Wedge, Zanesville, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOWER'S AIR COMPRESSOR.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PROFESSOR SANTINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cable dispatch announces the death of the Italian astronomer,\r\nGiovanni Santini. The Professor was born at Tuscany, June 30, 1786,\r\nand was in the ninety-first year of his age. He graduated at the\r\nUniversity of Pisa. He soon devoted himself to a study of the exact\r\nsciences, and in 1814 he had achieved so much distinction that he was\r\nappointed to a professorship in the Padowa Observatory in place\r\nof Vincenzo Cheminello. In 1825 he was appointed Rector of the\r\nUniversity, and up to the time of his death he held the position of\r\nProfessor of Astronomy and Director of Mathematical Studies. He was\r\ngenerally esteemed by the learned societies of Europe, and held\r\na number of honorary titles and degrees from various leading\r\nuniversities. He was also a correspondent of the French Academy. The\r\nprincipal books published by him are strictly scientific, such\r\nas \"Decimal Arithmetic\" (1808), \"Elements of Astronomy\" (1820),\r\n\"Logarithms and Trigonometry,\" and \"Optical Problems\" (1821-23). Some\r\nof his elementary works on astronomy for beginners are the best ever\r\npublished in Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN YULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death is announced of Mr. John Yule, of the Hutchestown Engine\r\nWorks, Rutherglen, N. B., at the age of 66. During early life, Mr.\r\nYule went the round of the best engineers' shops in Scotland and\r\nEngland, and became one of the recognized leaders in engineering\r\nprogress. His inventiveness took various directions, amongst other\r\nfruits being an improved rotary engine, a compensating governor for\r\nthe steam engine, and a screw tap, drill, and mandrel. For the latter\r\nhe was awarded the silver medal of the Scottish Society of Arts. For\r\nsome years Mr. Yule acted as the manager of the boiler department of\r\nMessrs. Robert Napier & Son's establishment, but eventually resumed\r\nbusiness at the Hutchestown Works, and devoted attention amongst\r\nother matters to the improvement of swing bridges and steam cranes and\r\nhammers. In the former line two of his most important works are the\r\nplate girder bridge over the entrance to one of the docks at Port\r\nGlasgow, for the Caledonian Railway, erected from plans by Messrs.\r\nBell and Miller, C.E., Glasgow; and a lattice girder bridge over the\r\nentrance to Kingston Dock, Glasgow Harbor. Owing to the angle at which\r\nthis last bridge crosses the dock, great difficulties were experienced\r\nin working out the mechanical details so as to admit of easy motion.\r\nThese were skillfully overcome, and the bridge was, as finally\r\nerected, a monument of his design as well as workmanship. The\r\nBlackhill incline on the Monkland Canal, constructed nearly a quarter\r\nof a century ago, is a sample of Mr. Yule's mechanical powers. Of late\r\nyears he was largely engaged as a professional valuator.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have recently taken the pains to make inquiries from the more\r\neminent bankers and merchants in the chief cities of the interior, and\r\nthe results of our inquiries have tended to confirm the belief we have\r\nmore than once expressed in this journal, that although, from various\r\ncauses, there is overhanging a portion of our American industries a\r\ncloud of gloom and depression, still throughout the nation at large\r\nthere is going on a process of growth and recovery from which the best\r\nresults are anticipated. How long we shall have to wait before the\r\nlife which is at work silently and secretly beneath the surface will\r\nput forth its full power, in the full harvest of productive activity,\r\nis, of course, impossible to foretell. What is chiefly important for\r\nus to know, however, is that the progress we are making tends upwards\r\nand not downwards, and that it promises to lead our industry and\r\ncommerce to a brighter and not to a darker future.--_Financial\r\nChronicle._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DISINFECT ROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disinfection of a room is not complete unless the walls have been\r\nthoroughly cleansed.

But the Carthagenian invasion was a modern\r\nepisode in Africa's experiences of that nature. On one of the earlier\r\nmonuments of Egypt there is figured a slave-hunter's raid upon an\r\nEthiopian village, the horrid details of which are said by travelers\r\nto be an accurate picture of a slave raid of to-day. The same\r\nmurderous work has been going on incessantly for at least 4,000 years:\r\nhow much longer there is no telling. For all these ages the African\r\nborders have known war and war only, and of the most destructive and\r\nbarbarizing nature.\r\n\r\nRecently, under the influence of Sir Samuel Baker, Colonel Gordon, and\r\nthe civilized world in general, the Khedive of Egypt has carried war\r\ninto the interior in the interests of peace: a conquest in a measure\r\njustified by the suppression of inter-tribal war for the filling of\r\nslave pens, and the abolition of the slave trade down the Nile. A\r\nsimilar reform has been effected on the east coast by the pressure of\r\nEnglish power on the Sultan of Zanzibar. And the immediate effect of\r\nthese two movements has been to prevent the butchery or enslavement of\r\nnot less than half a million negroes annually.\r\n\r\nA still more promising invasion of Africa has just been decided upon\r\nin the International Geographical Conference in Brussels: an invasion\r\nwholly in the interests of peace and civilization. At the meeting,\r\na year ago, it was declared advisable to establish, by international\r\neffort, a line of permanent commercial stations from Bagomoyo, on the\r\ncoast of Zanzibar, to St. Paul de Loanda, on the opposite Atlantic\r\ncoast; the first stations to be at Ujiji, where Stanley found\r\nLivingstone, on the eastern shore of lake Tanganyika; at Nyangwe,\r\nLivingstone's furthest point northward on the Lualaba; and at some\r\npoint further west on the route of Cameron, to be fixed in the\r\ndominions of Muata Yamvo, one of the most powerful chiefs of Central\r\nAfrica. At the second conference, which ended June 24, arrangements\r\nwere made for sending out the first expedition toward Tanganyika.\r\n\r\nThe object of the proposed stations is the development of civilization\r\nby commerce, not by religious propaganda. Primarily they will serve\r\nas bases of operation for explorers of the interior, a sort of\r\n_entrepots_, where the explorer may supply himself with provisions,\r\ninstruments, and goods, and thus save the cost and embarrassment of\r\nan army of porters from the coast. They will also serve as places of\r\nrefuge for explorers in times of sickness and other reverses, which\r\nhave hitherto so terribly hampered explorers. The heads of these\r\npioneer establishments are to be men of scientific training and proved\r\nexecutive ability; and each will be aided by a physician-naturalist\r\nand a few skilled artisans. The points thus far chosen are on a line\r\nregularly traveled by the caravans of Arab traders, carrying coffee,\r\ntea, sugar, arms, and woven goods to permanent Arab residences and\r\ntrading stations in the interior. An agent of the London Missionary\r\nSociety has already begun the survey of a route for ox teams as far\r\nas lake Tanganyika; and Cameron has expressed the opinion that a light\r\nnarrow-gauge railway could be constructed from the coast to the lake\r\nat a cost not exceeding four thousand dollars a mile. The traffic\r\nalong such a road, he thinks, would soon pay interest on the outlay.\r\n\r\nThe unexplored region thus to be opened up to civilization and\r\ncommerce (other than in human beings) is larger than the United\r\nStates east of the Mississippi. Around it is a still larger region of\r\npartially explored country of unequalled fertility, abounding in great\r\nlakes and navigable rivers, and for the most part so high above\r\nthe sea that the products of the tropics mingle with those of\r\nthe temperate zone. The cereals, durah, maize, rice, sugar cane,\r\nstarch-yielding roots and tubers, cotton, coffee, tobacco, spices,\r\ngums and caoutchouc, dye-stuffs and medicinal plants, the banana,\r\nfig, date, orange, and the vine are among the known products of this\r\nregion; and all are capable of becoming important staples of foreign\r\ncommerce. The country is not less rich in coal, iron, copper, gold,\r\nand other valuable minerals. The climate, though moist from abundant\r\nrain, is less debilitating than India or Brazil; and everywhere, away\r\nfrom the miasmatic coast regions and the marshes of the lower river\r\ncourses, European explorers have found small cause for complaining of\r\nexcessive heat or unhealthiness. On the elevated plateaus which cover\r\nso large a part of Central Africa, the climate is like that of the\r\nsanitariums of India; while among the mountains the finest climates of\r\nthe world are fairly rivalled. Stanley found in the mountainous region\r\nbetween the great lakes and within a degree of the equator every\r\nclimatic condition and every element of landscape beauty that could\r\nattract and delight a white colony. It was a perfect alpine country,\r\nwith mountains rising from twelve to fifteen thousand feet, yet free\r\nfrom alpine cold and snow. Countless torrents from the hills watered\r\never-verdant valleys as beautiful as those of Tyrol, lying under a\r\nbrilliant equatorial sun, yet with a climate as cool and equable as\r\nany European might desire. Further south, among the mountains about\r\nLake Nyassa, the same features are presented on a grander scale:\r\na country aptly described as a second Switzerland of gigantic\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of the ability of Europeans to sustain\r\nthemselves in the greater part of the interior-certainly on all the\r\nhigher plateaus-nor of the possibility of building up in Central\r\nAfrica a great civilized empire. Nature offers every facility, and the\r\nnative population seem to be well fitted for productive industry. In\r\nevery respect they are physically and morally superior to the negroes\r\nof the coast, and only need protection and the encouragement of\r\nlegitimate commerce to weld them into a great nation. Already\r\nthey stand on the borders of civilization. They are intelligent,\r\nindustrious, and not unskillful in the manufacture of iron and copper\r\nornaments, utensils, and weapons. The arts of tanning, spinning,\r\nweaving, dyeing, mat-making, etc., are widely diffused among them, and\r\nmany of their products are remarkable for their fineness and\r\nstrength. They carry on agriculture with considerable success;\r\nand, notwithstanding the chronic state of insecurity incident to\r\nslave-hunting, their wealth in cattle is very great. As soon as the\r\ndisturbing and impoverishing influence of the slave traffic is abated,\r\nand a market provided for the products of peace, the advancement of\r\nthe people in civilization is likely to go on with great rapidity.\r\nAs the source of raw materials which we need, and as a market for the\r\nsurplus manufactures of Europe and America, the country offers, to say\r\nthe least, many attractions; and it will not be surprising if, within\r\nfifty years, thriving commercial stations will be founded on all\r\nits great lakes and rivers, and connected with the outer world by\r\ntelegraphy, railways, and steamship lines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF CLARENCE KING ON CATASTROPHISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence King lately delivered an interesting address before the\r\nSheffield Scientific School of Yale College, New Haven, Conn., under\r\nthe title of \"Catastrophism, or the Evolution of Environment,\" which\r\npromises to evoke considerable discussion. We subjoin an abstract of\r\nthe principal features of the address, which is quite lengthy. The\r\nfull text will be found in our SUPPLEMENTS, Nos. 80, 81.\r\n\r\nMr. King refuted the doctrine of slow evolution as taught by Huxley\r\nand Darwin, and declared that the surface of the earth and climate had\r\nbeen subject to sudden and catastrophic mutation, which included in\r\nits environment all types of life.\r\n\r\nHe reasoned that marine fossils are found entombed in rocky beds far\r\nremote from present seas; and that these beds were once sea bottoms\r\nthat have been upheaved by convulsions of Nature. The earliest history\r\nof mankind is pregnant with catastrophe, and we have historic story\r\nand biblical record of its sudden and destructive energy. He called\r\nto mind the vast and massive eruptions of the Pliocene basalt as seen\r\nupon our own continent.\r\n\r\nThe great obvious changes in the rocky crust were referred to a few\r\nprocesses; the sub-aerial decay of continents, delivery by streams\r\nof land-detritus into the sea, the spreading out of these comminuted\r\nmaterials upon a pelagic floor, and lastly upheaval, by which oceanic\r\nbeds were lifted up into subsequent land masses. All these processes\r\nhe declared to have been more rapid in the past than now. Suddenness,\r\nworld-wide destructiveness, were the characteristics of geological\r\nchanges. Periods of calm, like the present, are suddenly terminated by\r\nbrief catastrophic epochs. Successive faunas and floras were created\r\nonly to be extinguished by general cataclysms.\r\n\r\nHe believed in recurrent, abrupt accelerations of crust change, so\r\nviolent as to destroy all life on the globe. He declared the idea to\r\nbe the survival of a prehistoric terror, and was backed up by breaks\r\nin the great palaeontological record. Of the geologic features of\r\nour continent, he said that beneath our America lies buried another\r\ndistinct continent, which he called Archaean America, which was made\r\nup of what was originally ocean beds lifted into the air and locally\r\ncrumpled into vast mountain chains, which were in turn eroded by\r\ntorrents into mountain peaks. The original coast lines of this\r\ncontinent we may never be able fully to survey, but its great\r\nfeatures, the lofty chains of the mountains which made its bones, were\r\nvery nearly co-extensive with our existing systems, the Appalachians\r\nand Cordilleras. The canon-cutting rivers of the present Western\r\nmountains have dug out the peaks and flanks of those underlying,\r\nprimeval uplifts and developed an astonishing topography; peaks rising\r\nin a single sweep 30,000 feet from their bases, precipices lifting\r\nbold, solid fronts 10,000 feet into the air, and profound mountain\r\nvalleys. The work of erosion, which has been carried on by torrents\r\nof the quaternary age, brings to light buried primeval chains loftier\r\nthan any of the present heights of the globe.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Palaezoic age, two enormous masses of what,\r\nprobably, were then continents began to sink, and as they disappeared\r\nthe present Atlantic and Pacific oceans appeared, while the sea-floor\r\nof a then ocean, emerged, and became the new continent of America.\r\nDividing this new continent was a sea, but catastrophe removed this\r\nsea and resulted in the folding up of mountain ranges 20,000 and\r\n40,000 feet in height, thereby essentially changing the whole climate\r\nof the continent. Of the land life of the mesozoic age we have\r\nabundant remains. The wonderful reptilian and avian fauna of the\r\nmesozoic age is now familiar to all. But after the catastrophe, and\r\nthe change of climate which must necessarily have ensued, this fauna\r\ntotally perished.\r\n\r\nAfter criticising the opinions of Huxley, Lyell, Hutton, Darwin, and\r\nothers, he recurred to the effects of sudden terrestrial or cosmical\r\nchanges, and conceived that the effects of these changes would\r\nbe, first, extermination; secondly, destruction of the biological\r\nequilibrium; and thirdly, rapid morphological change on the part of\r\nplastic species. When catastrophic change burst in upon the ages of\r\nuniformity, and sounded in the ear of every living thing the words\r\n\"Change or die!\" plasticity became the sole principle of salvation.\r\nAnd plasticity is the key to survival and prosperity. Mr. King\r\nremarked in conclusion of his address: \"He who brought to bear that\r\nmysterious energy we call life upon primeval matter bestowed at\r\nthe same time a power of development by change, arranging that the\r\ninteraction of energy and matter, which make up environment should,\r\nfrom time to time, burst in upon the current of life and sweep it\r\nonward and upward to ever higher and better manifestations. Moments of\r\ngreat catastrophe, thus translated into the language of life, become\r\nmoments of creation, when out of plastic organisms something newer and\r\nnobler is called into being.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUPLEX EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe age in which we live is a fast one, and he who does not move with\r\nequal celerity, and keep pace with those around him, is ruthlessly\r\nthrust to the wall, and remains there unless he has strength and will\r\nto regain the lost position. We call to our aid every force of\r\nNature and invoke the assistance of every appliance with which we are\r\ncognizant. We call our fathers slow, and to us they were so; but there\r\nwas the same need of celerity in their every-day life as to-day there\r\nis in ours.\r\n\r\nWhile calling to our aid the elements of Nature and adapting thousands\r\nof mechanical appliances to our wants, do we not often feel that there\r\nis beyond all these a \"something\" that may be invoked and trained to\r\nhelp us on in the race of life? Occasionally we find dim glimmerings\r\nof this \"something\" that we believe will eventually grow to be one of\r\nthe prominent sciences. Physiologists tell us that the human brain is\r\ndouble, that the right and left lobes act in a degree independent of\r\neach other--the right lobe of the brain controlling the physiology of\r\nthe left side of the individual from head to heel, while the left lobe\r\nexercises a like dominion on the opposite side. Grant this to be true,\r\nthen can be explained the idiosyncrasy that is occasionally seen in\r\nindividuals, of which we may instance that of writing at the same\r\ntime with both hands; and again we have heard of telegraph operators\r\nsending and receiving two messages at the same time, operating with\r\nboth hands, and independent of each other. It is said that Nasmyth,\r\nthe inventor of the steam hammer, could actually produce two sketches\r\nor drawings in this way and at the same time. It is also affirmed that\r\nSir Charles Fox, the architect of the Exhibition building of 1851,\r\ncould write upon two ideas at the same time and transfer these ideas\r\nsimultaneously to paper with right and left hand. The mechanic can\r\noften be found who can operate upon one piece of mechanism, while at\r\nthe same time his brain is busy upon the study of some unborn idea,\r\nforeign to that work upon which he is laboring. Writers can be found\r\nwho can write out one train of ideas, while ideas entirely different\r\nare being cogitated upon somewhere in their craniums. We have even\r\nheard it affirmed that an indistinct glimmering of a third idea would\r\noccasionally peep around the corner of the caputs of these favored\r\nones.\r\n\r\nWhy not educate this? Why not form schools and institutions to bring\r\nit out and lead the brain to perform this double function? It can\r\ncertainly be done. The world wants it, surely. The age demands it.\r\nIndividuals need it. If these individuals can succeed and become\r\nexperts in this method of double work, will not double compensation\r\nand a greater remuneration be their reward? This, certainly, will be\r\nan incentive to its acquirement. Go to the apprentice when first he\r\ntakes position beside the vise, with chipping chisel in one hand and\r\nhammer in the other. The injunction he mentally receives as he raises\r\nthe hammer is, that to miss the chisel is to hit his knuckles. After\r\na few demonstrative blows he knows what it means, and therefore chisel\r\nand hammer soon come by some strange process to harmonize in action,\r\nso that in whatever position the head of the chisel may be, the blow\r\nis sure to be properly received, and that, too, without any sensible\r\neffort on his part. In this illustration both right and left hand are\r\ntaught to act, by brain dictation, in a certain concerted manner.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find that mutes have been learned to articulate words\r\nand sentences by proper education, they being taught to imitate the\r\nmotions of the mouth and labial organs as by their tutors directed.\r\nEducation can do much, and these are some of its results. Can we not\r\nby proper teaching produce all the results as shown in the case of\r\nNasmyth and Fox. The first lessons must necessarily be simple. For\r\ninstance, two things done at the same time with both hands, giving\r\nexpression at this time to ideas connected therewith, but distinct\r\nfrom each other. From this simple lesson we progress, and, as the\r\nultimatum, we may arrive at greater achievements than Nasmyth or Fox\r\never dreamed of. We may find that we can so divide our entity that we\r\ncan be conscious of a double-brain existence in a dual action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARRIGEEN CROP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the great majority of people, Carrigeen, under the more familiar\r\nname of Irish Moss, is known chiefly as the basis of a pleasant and\r\nwholesome drink for the sick room, or as an article of use in the\r\npreparation of delicacies for the table. Comparatively few are aware\r\nof its wide and varied use in the arts, or that the thousands of\r\nbarrels of it employed annually by our manufacturers of paper, cloth,\r\nfelt, and straw hats, etc., and by brewers, is not an Irish, but an\r\nAmerican product, and, speaking strictly, is not a moss but a seaweed.\r\n\r\nCarrigeen (_chondrus crispus_) is to be found more or less abundantly\r\nall along our northern coast, ranging between the low water line\r\nand the depth of forty feet, or so; but as a rule its fronds, which\r\ncorrespond to the leaves of air plants, are so numerously inhabited by\r\nsmall mollusca that they are spoiled for other use. The clean-growing\r\narticle seems to be limited almost wholly to certain ledges in the\r\nneighborhood of Scituate, Mass.--a section of coast guarded by the\r\ncelebrated Minot Ledge Lighthouse, and famous for its danger to\r\nshipping. Here, where the waves of the Atlantic dash with full force\r\nupon the rocky coast, the carrigeen grows to perfection; and wherever\r\nit escapes the spawn of mussels and other shellfish, is gathered\r\nduring the summer season in vast quantities.\r\n\r\nThe harvest begins in May and ends about the first of September. The\r\ngathering is made in two ways--by hand-picking during exceptionally\r\nlow tides, and by means of long-handled iron-toothed rakes at ordinary\r\ntides. Of course the work cannot be carried on except during fair\r\nweather. Hand-pulling is possible only during the bi-monthly periods\r\nof spring tides, that is, when the moon is full and again at new moon.\r\nAt such times high tide occurs about midday and midnight, and the\r\nledges are exposed for moss gathering morning and evening. The\r\nmossers' boats are rowed to the rocks where the finest grades abound,\r\nand the gatherers select with great care the growths that are freest\r\nfrom minute shells and other foreign matter. This portion of the crop,\r\nif properly handled afterwards, generally goes to the apothecary and\r\nfetches a price two or three times that of the common grade.\r\n\r\nAs the tide rises the pickers are driven to their boats, and proceed\r\nto the outer moss-bearing rocks where the rake is used, as it also is\r\nduring ordinary low tides. Moss taken in this way is not so clean as\r\nthe hand-picked, and is always mixed with tape grass, which must be\r\nremoved during the process of curing and packing.\r\n\r\nThe curing of the moss is the most critical part of this peculiar\r\nfarming. On being brought to the shore the moss is black and\r\nunsightly; it must be bleached as well as dried. The bleaching is\r\neffected by repeated wetting and drying in the sun; and as the moss\r\nis readily soluble in fresh water the bleaching beds are situated\r\nnear the banks of the salt creeks that abound along the shore. After\r\ndrying, the moss is packed in tubs and rolled to the water, where it\r\nis thoroughly washed, then rolled back to the bleaching bed, to\r\nbe dried again in the sun. Five or six such exposures are usually\r\nsufficient. On the bleaching ground, the moss is carefully spread\r\nand turned, and watchfully guarded against wetting by rain. In this\r\nprocess it turns from black to red, then to the yellowish-white of the\r\nperfected article. When properly cured the moss is stored in bulk,\r\nin shanties; where, as time permits, it is picked over and packed in\r\nbarrels. The crop averages about half a million pounds a year; and\r\nthanks to the brighter and more abundant sunshine of our coast, the\r\nmoss has a brighter color and is of finer quality than the Irish\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATASTROPHISM IN GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence King was probably not a little surprised to learn from\r\nthe Tribune that in his most suggestive address on \"Catastrophism and\r\nthe Evolution of Environment,\" he had turned the guns of Geology upon\r\nBiology; and that in calling attention to the influence of periods of\r\naccelerated change in environment upon exposed types of life he had\r\nswept away the \"fundamental doctrines upon which has been built the\r\nscheme of development by natural selection and the survival of the\r\nfittest.\" Certainly nothing in the address betrays any consciousness\r\nof possible effects of that sort. And it is quite probable also that\r\nMr. King will have to suffer some annoyance from seeing his name set\r\nup at gaze, like Joshua's moon in Ajalon, by the unscientific press\r\ngenerally, as that of the newest champion of orthodoxy against the\r\nleaders of modern scientific thought: a penalty which scientific men\r\nalways have to pay for emphasizing neglected truths.\r\n\r\nMr. King certainly deals some telling blows against the position of\r\nthe stricter school of Uniformitarians in geology, and brings into\r\nprominence a much neglected element in the struggle for existence; but\r\nthere is no scientific revolution threatened, nor are any crumbs of\r\ncomfort spread for those endeavoring to arrest the natural drift of\r\nscientific progress.\r\n\r\nThe issue between Mr. King and the sticklers for uniformity in rates\r\nof geological change is simply this: In the reaction against the\r\nsweeping cataclysms, the sudden wipings out of whole creations and\r\nthe sudden introductions of new worlds of life believed in by earlier\r\ngeologists, the modern English school has come to look upon time and\r\nthe slower modifications of the earth's surface, now observable, with\r\nthe struggle for existence under easy conditions, as the chief factors\r\nin geological change and its accompanying variations in the forms of\r\nlife. Mr. King, on the other hand, insists that in so doing they have\r\ntaken too little account of catastrophic changes, that is, widespread\r\nand sudden movements of sea and land. In other words, he raises rapid\r\nchange of environment from the subordinate place it has hitherto\r\noccupied in the scheme of historical development, and gives special\r\nemphasis to the grand geologic movements which have to do with such\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nIn this Mr. King has unquestionably rendered good service to the\r\nscience he has done so much to extend and honor in the field; while\r\nthe illustrations from American geology which he brings to bear on the\r\nsubject are as likely as his sturdy opinions to attract attention.\r\nYet we are inclined to think that in some things he has allowed his\r\nenthusiasm to run away with him. The stolid self-confidence of\r\nextreme Uniformitarians has tempted him to exaggerate the periodic\r\naccelerations of geologic and biologic movement, and to overstate\r\ntheir effects quite as much as others have underestimated them;\r\nand when he charges the followers of Lyell with intellectual\r\nnear-sightedness and a lack of \"the very mechanism of imagination,\"\r\nthey may possibly be able to retort not unjustifiably that he has\r\nmistaken the natural foreshortening of the geological vista due to\r\ndistance for actual brevity; and that his belief in the abruptness and\r\nsuddenness of the great changes which the earth's strata record, may\r\nbe due to his own lack of sustained imaginative power for grasping and\r\ninterpreting all the evidences of the enormous time really involved.\r\nBut this is a question not of imaginative capacity but of logical\r\ndeduction from observed facts; and however abrupt the beginning of\r\nsome of the great geologic movements may have been, their subsequent\r\nprogress cannot in all cases have been so rapid as to allow of their\r\nbeing called catastrophic in any ordinary acceptation of the term.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the alleged catastrophe which marked the close of\r\nthe mesozoic age in the West. Of this movement Mr. King remarks: \"In\r\na quasi-uniformitarian way, 20,000 or 30,000 feet of sediment had\r\naccumulated in the Pacific and 14,000 in the [American] mediterranean\r\nsea; when these regions, which, during the reception of sediment,\r\nhad been areas of subsidence, suddenly upheaved, the doming up of the\r\nmiddle of the continent quite obliterating the mediterranean sea and\r\nuniting the two land masses into one. The catastrophe which removed\r\nthis sea resulted in the folding up of mountain ranges 20,000 and\r\n40,000 feet in height, thereby essentially changing the whole climate\r\nof the continent.\"\r\n\r\nThat this great change occurred, and was attended with an obliteration\r\nof the wonderful reptilian and avian fauna of the mesozoic age, is\r\nmost true: that it occurred suddenly does not appear. On the contrary,\r\nthere is evidence to show that the prodigious folding up of mountain\r\nranges involved could not have proceeded with sufficient rapidity to\r\nturn the course of a stream of water. It happened that one of those\r\nfolds--one which, had no denudation been going on meanwhile,\r\nwould have lifted its crest higher than the highest peak of the\r\nHimalayas--lay directly across the course of the Colorado river. The\r\nriver held its course uninterruptedly, sawing its way through the\r\nuplift until six vertical miles of rocky strata had risen past it. At\r\nno time, therefore, could the rapidity of motion in the bulging strata\r\nhave exceeded the capacity of the river to wear away the obstruction,\r\nand the bulge was fifty miles across! We do not know how rapidly a\r\nriver may sink its channel through such a rising barrier; but we do\r\nknow that a process of that nature cannot legitimately be described\r\nas swift or sudden. And surely it requires not less intellectual\r\nfar-sightedness and imaginative faculty to carry the mind across the\r\nenormous stretch of time involved in such a change slowly wrought--a\r\nperiod during which at least three vertical miles of the rising\r\nmountain fold was worn down by rain and atmospheric abrasion--as to\r\nmass the continental doming, the mountain folding, and the attendant\r\nlife changes together as a convulsive \"catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. King, however, is not a Catastrophist of a very violent sort. He\r\nshelves among the errors of the past the belief in such cataclysms as\r\nCuvier believed in, involving world-wide destruction of all life--\"the\r\nmere survival of a prehistoric terror, backed up by breaks in the\r\npalaeontological record and protected within those safe cities of\r\nrefuge, the Cosmogonies;\" though he rejects as equally unsatisfactory\r\nthe mild affirmations of the Uniformitarians, that existing rates\r\nof change and indefinite time are enough to account for all the\r\ngeological record. With our present light, he holds, geological\r\nhistory seems to be a dovetailing together of the two ideas. \"The ages\r\nhave had their periods of geological serenity, when change progressed\r\nin the still, unnoticeable way, and life through vast lapses of\r\ntime followed the stately flow of years; drifting on by insensible\r\ngradations through higher and higher forms, and then all at once\r\na part of the earth suffered short, sharp, destructive revolution\r\nunheralded as an earthquake or volcanic eruptions.\" Thus stated, his\r\nposition does not seem to be radically different from that of\r\nthe broader Uniformitarians, except that he marks the periods of\r\naccelerated physical change, and not those of comparative quiescence,\r\nas the dominant ones in their influence on life-change. He takes\r\nhigh and strong ground, too, in insisting that it is the business\r\nof geology not simply to decipher and map out the changes which have\r\ntaken place in the configuration of the globe and in its climatic\r\nconditions, but also to investigate and fix the rates of change. And\r\nwhen the evolution of environment takes form as a distinct branch of\r\ngeology, he expects to witness a marked modification in the dominant\r\nviews of biologists. Its few broad laws will include \"neither the\r\nabsolute uniformitarianism of Lyell and Hutton, Darwin and Haeckel,\r\nnor the universal catastrophism of Cuvier and the majority of\r\nteleogists.\" \"Huxley alone among prominent evolutionists opens the\r\ndoor for a union of the residue of truth in the two schools, fusing\r\nthem in his proposed evolutional geology.\"\r\n\r\nSo, on looking back over a trail of thirty thousand miles of\r\ngeological travel, Mr. King is impelled to say that Mr. Huxley's\r\nfar-sighted view perfectly satisfies his interpretation of the broad\r\nfacts of the American continent.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. King's observations in regard to plasticity of physical\r\nstructure in connection with rapidly changing environment and the\r\nstruggle for existence, we propose to speak at another time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great stone monuments of England, like Stonehenge, are supposed,\r\nby Mr. James Fergusson, to be military trophies, erected in the time\r\nof King Arthur on the battle fields by the victorious armies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW APPARATUS FOR STORING AND UTILIZING SOLAR HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apparatus herewith illustrated is devised to collect solar heat or\r\nother heat, store it up in a heat reservoir--a mass of iron or other\r\nsuitable material--confine it in the reservoir until needed, keep\r\nit in such form that it can be transported from place to place, and\r\nutilize it for industrial or other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR STORING AND UTILIZING SOLAR HEAT.]\r\n\r\nA is a concave mirror for concentrating the solar rays upon the heat\r\nreservoir, B, which is a mass of iron. C is the heat box for\r\nconfining the heat until needed, and also for serving as package for\r\ntransporting the heat reservoir when hot. G is the heat reservoir\r\nchamber, in which the heat is communicated from the hot reservoir to\r\nthe air. Under certain circumstances the heat reservoir may be heated\r\nin the heat reservoir chamber. H is a devaporizing chamber, for\r\nextracting the moisture from the air by means of a deliquescent\r\nsubstance or other material or treatment. A vertical stack or flue, I,\r\ncommunicates with the heat reservoir chamber, for conveying the heated\r\nair away for use.\r\n\r\nThe device for concentrating the solar rays may be either stationary\r\nor movable, and, if movable, may be moved by hand, or automatically,\r\nto follow the sun.

Charles A. Catlin and George F. Wilson, of Providence, R.\r\nI., have patented, May 8, 1877, a new process of utilizing tin scrap,\r\nwhereby they claim the tin is recovered, either as a valuable salt\r\nof that metal or in the metallic form, and the iron or other metal is\r\nleft as a scrap at once available for reworking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLIN AND WILSON'S PROCESS OF UTILIZING TIN SCRAP.]\r\n\r\nIn any suitable building, a crane, A, is erected and placed in the\r\nsweep of that crane; in any convenient order are a boiler, D, two\r\ntanks, B and C, an evaporating pan, F, and an additional tank, E.\r\nFrom the crane is suspended a wire basket to contain the scrap to be\r\ntreated, so perforated as to admit of the ready entrance of the liquid\r\nwhen submerged in, and its ready escape when withdrawn from, the\r\nboiler, D, in which boiler is put a sufficient quantity of the\r\nsolution of caustic soda or potash to allow of a complete submersion\r\ntherein of the basket and its contents. The basket, G, is then filled\r\nwith the material to be treated, sprinkling in during the filling the\r\nrequisite quantity of common salt or other chloride and nitrate\r\nof soda or other nitrate, using these dry, not in solution, either\r\npreviously mixed or shaken in together in the proportion of from three\r\nto five pounds each to every hundred pounds of scrap, the requisite\r\nquantity depending upon the thickness of the thin [tin?] plate to be\r\nremoved. The loaded basket, being elevated by the crane, A, is\r\nthen swung round, and, by lowering, submerged in the hot or boiling\r\nsolution of caustic soda or potash in the iron boiler, D, which may\r\nhold in solution a further proportion of the chloride and nitrate\r\nused, the heat of which solution is maintained by a fire beneath the\r\nboiler, or in any other and ordinary way. In the ensuing reaction the\r\noxygen of the nitrate combines with the tin to form stannic acid, and\r\nthis, in turn, combining with the alkali present, forms a stannate\r\nof that base, which, entering into solution, leaves the before-plated\r\nmetal tin-free, the chloride present assisting in the reaction. A\r\nfurther and more complex reaction takes place, by which copious fumes\r\nof ammonia are evolved, which may be utilized by proper appliances.\r\nWhen the reaction is complete, the basket containing the now tin-freed\r\nscrap is withdrawn from the boiler, and suspended above it long enough\r\nto drain. It is then swung over the tank, C, containing water, in\r\nwhich it is washed by submerging and withdrawing several times, and\r\nin like manner the washing completed in the water of the tank, B. The\r\ncontents of the basket being now discharged, it is again filled with\r\nfresh scrap in the manner already described, and the process repeated.\r\nThe loss by evaporation from the boiler, D, is supplied by the wash\r\nwater in the tank, C; this, in turn, being supplied by the wash water\r\nin the tank, B, to which fresh water is supplied as required. When\r\nthe caustic solution is sufficiently charged with the tin salt, it\r\nis allowed to deposit the impure crystals, which, being removed and\r\ndrained, are redissolved in water in the iron tank, E. This solution\r\nin the iron tank, E, after filtration or decantation, is again\r\nconcentrated in the evaporating pan, F, the crystals of stannate being\r\nremoved from time to time, drained and dried; or the impure crystals\r\nobtained in the boiler, D, may be mixed with fine charcoal or other\r\nreducing agent, and subjected to the requisite heat for the reduction\r\nof the tin to the metallic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ALLOY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very beautiful new alloy, intended to replace brass in various\r\nornamental uses, especially in window and door furniture, has been\r\ninvented by W. A. Hopkins, of Paris. The alloy is composed of copper,\r\ntin, spelter, or zinc and lead, which metals are manipulated. A\r\ncrucible is placed in the furnace and fired to red heat, and into the\r\ncrucible thus heated the metals are placed in the proportions of--tin\r\n1-1/8 (say) 1 oz., spelter or zinc 1/2 oz., lead 5/16 of an ounce. These\r\nare the proportions he prefers to use, as he has found them to give\r\nexcellent and satisfactory results, but he does not intend to confine\r\nhimself rigidly to the precise proportions named, as they may,\r\nperhaps, be slightly varied in some particulars without materially\r\ndetracting from the beautiful color of the alloy which it is\r\nintended to produce. The molten metals are kept well stirred, and\r\nany impurities therein should be removed. When thoroughly mixed,\r\nthis alloy, which is termed the first alloy, is poured off into ingot\r\nmoulds and left to cool. Copper, in the proportion of eight parts to\r\none of this first alloy, is then placed in the crucible and brought\r\nto melting heat, when the tin or first alloy is added and intimately\r\nmixed with the copper, for which purpose the molten mass must be well\r\nstirred for several minutes; it is then poured into ingot moulds for\r\nsale in the form of ingots, or it may be poured into pattern moulds so\r\nas to produce the articles required. This is the mode of manipulation\r\nwhich it is preferred to employ, as an opportunity is thus afforded of\r\nremoving any impurities from the first alloy before mixing it with the\r\ncopper; but all the metals may, if preferred, be mixed together in the\r\nproportions given and melted at one operation. By this means an alloy\r\nis obtained of great strength, and of a very beautiful appearance, and\r\nwhich is particularly suitable for small work, such, for instance, as\r\nwindow and door furniture and other house furniture which is usually\r\nmade in brass or other alloy of copper, though it is not intended to\r\nconfine its use to such articles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEBASTIN--AN IMPROVED EXPLOSIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of the explosive known as dynamite, an infusorial\r\nearth is used, which is filled with or made to absorb nitroglycerin.\r\nAs compared with certain kinds of charcoal, however, the absorptive\r\nand retentive power of infusorial earth in small changes of\r\ntemperature unfavorably affect the common dynamite, and cause a\r\nseparation of the nitrogylcerin from the infusorial earth. The\r\nimprovement we now refer to is the invention of G. Fahnehjelm, of\r\nStockholm, Sweden, and consists in the substitution of a highly\r\nporous and absorptive species of wood charcoal, in place of the\r\nearth heretofore employed. The author designates his production as\r\n\"sebastin,\" and gives a number of interesting particulars as follow:\r\n\r\nIn order to produce a charcoal having the required quantities, the\r\ncarbonization or coking must be done in such a manner as to completely\r\ndestroy the organic substances, and to produce as porous a charcoal as\r\npossible. For this he selects by preference young trees or striplings\r\nor branches of poplar, hazelwood, or alder tree, and he burns them in\r\nan open fire. When the wood has been consumed he does not put out the\r\nfire by means of water, but leaves it to go out of itself. In this\r\nway he obtains a very inflammable and very porous charcoal, which can\r\nabsorb more than five, and approaching six times its weight of\r\nnitroglycerin without any risk of the separation of the oil. The\r\ncharcoal is pulverized in a wooden mortar, but it should not be\r\nreduced to too fine a powder, else it will not so completely absorb\r\nthe nitroglycerin. The charcoal produced in the ordinary way, or by\r\nclosed fire, is quite different as regards absorbing power. Charcoal\r\nof fir trees may, however, be used, and may acquire nearly the same\r\nqualities, that is, if charred a second time in a special oven.\r\n\r\nBy mixing the different kinds of charcoal, a material may be obtained\r\npossessing the required absorbing qualities, and an explosive compound\r\nmay then be obtained of the required power without loss of the\r\nnecessary consistency--that is, without being too dry, which is not\r\ndesirable. The charcoal not only serves as the best absorbent for the\r\nnitroglycerin, but it plays also an important part in the combustion.\r\nThe nitroglycerin in exploding decomposes into steam, carbonic acid,\r\nnitrogen, and oxygen. In the explosion of dynamite with inert base the\r\noxygen goes away without being utilized, but in the explosion of this\r\nnew compound (the new sebastin as he calls it) a part of the absorbent\r\ncharcoal is burnt by means of the liberated oxygen. The quantity of\r\ngas is thus augmented, and also the development of heat, whereby again\r\nthe tension of this gas is augmented. As, however, the quantity of\r\ncharcoal necessary for the complete absorption of the nitroglycerin\r\nis in all cases much larger than that which can reduce the excess of\r\noxygen produced at the explosion into carbonic acid, he adds to the\r\ncompound a salt, which also by the combustion gives an excess amount\r\nof oxygen which may contribute to burn the rest of the charcoal. For\r\nthis purpose he uses by preference nitrate of potassa, which may be\r\nadded without any risk, and which gives the explosive compound a very\r\nmuch greater rapidity or vehemence, and consequent force of explosion.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the new sebastin depends upon the objects for which\r\nit is to be used, and the effects intended to be produced. The\r\nstrongest compound, and even in this there is stated to be no risk of\r\nthe separation of the nitroglycerin, is composed of 78 parts by\r\nweight of nitroglycerin, 14 of the wood charcoal, and 8 of nitrate of\r\npotassa; and when less power is required the proportions are\r\nvaried, the second quality consisting of 68 per cent. by weight of\r\nnitroglycerin, 20 of the charcoal, and 12 of nitrate of potassa.\r\n\r\nTo show the relative strength of the compounds, the inventor says: Let\r\nthe dynamic force of pure nitroglycerin be represented by the number\r\n2,884,043.6, then the dynamic force of the sebastin No. 1, as\r\nabove, will be indicated by 2,416,575, and of the sebastin No. 2 by\r\n1,933,079.4, while that of dynamite No. 1 (consisting of 75 per\r\ncent. of nitroglycerin and 25 per cent. of infusorial earth) will be\r\nrepresented by 674,694.\r\n\r\nFor the above qualities of sebastin the increased effect produced by\r\nthe greater rapidity of the explosion must be taken into account also.\r\nThe increase has not yet been measured, but is estimated at 10 per\r\ncent. The sebastin may also be compounded in other proportions of the\r\nconstituent parts, but the object being to produce explosive compounds\r\nof the greatest force which it is possible to employ without danger,\r\nhe merely mentions that the proportion by weight may vary from 50\r\nto 80 per cent. of nitroglycerin, 15 to 35 per cent. of the prepared\r\ncharcoal, and 5 to 20 per cent. of the nitrate of potassa; the parts\r\nbeing taken by weight, as above stated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW METHOD OF BOOKBINDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed engravings represent a new system of binding books,\r\nfor which a number of important advantages are claimed. It obviates\r\nstitching, allows of each leaf being firmly secured, and hence is\r\nespecially well suited for single-leaved books. It admits of plates\r\nand maps being bound in their proper places instead of being pasted\r\nin, and renders the book much stronger and more durable. The inventor\r\nclaims a saving of 40 to 75 per cent of the time required for\r\nstitching, and of 50 per cent of the time needed in ordinary rebinding\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bookbinding Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nThe mode of operation is as follows: On receiving the sheets, the\r\nbinder folds them and places them in consecutive order, according to\r\nthe printer's signature. The front and bottom edges of the book are\r\nthen trimmed so as to obtain two straight sides; and the backs of the\r\nsheets are cut off, transforming them into single leaves. Horizontal\r\nlines are now marked with pencil across the back of the book for the\r\nsaw cuts; and a diagonal line, A, B, Fig. 2, is drawn to serve as a\r\nguide in replacing the leaves in their proper places. A thin coat of\r\nglue is next applied to the back; and when this is dry, the book is\r\ndivided into sections of from four to eight leaves (without counting\r\nthem) entirely disregarding the printer's signatures, but placing the\r\nsheets in their original order. The binder places the first section\r\nremoved at his right hand, the next at his left, and so on, forming\r\ntwo piles. Each pile is then straightened, and in the back of each, a\r\nlittle below the transverse lines, are made bevel cuts with the saw.\r\nSaid cuts are 1/8 inch in length, inclined at an angle of\r\n45 deg., and so placed that one half their length is above and the other\r\nhalf below the marked line. When one pile of sheets is thus sawn, the\r\nother pile is similarly treated; but the corresponding cuts are made\r\nat relatively opposite angles. This will be understood from Fig. 1, in\r\nwhich C represents the edge of the right hand pile, for example, and D\r\nthat of the left hand pile.\r\n\r\nThe sections of each pile are now returned in their regular order,\r\naccording to the printer's signatures. Should a section have been\r\nmisplaced, the diagonal line, being thus broken, will show the fact.\r\nIt will be seen, however, that this arrangement involves the alternate\r\nuse of sheets from each pile, so that, when all are put together, the\r\nbeveled cuts will cross or form dovetails, as shown in Fig. 3. Half\r\ninch strips of white paper muslin, E, Fig. 4, are next pasted around\r\nthe back edges of the first and last sections. This is done to\r\nstrengthen the hold of the twines in the back of the book, said\r\nsections necessarily bearing the whole strain of the covers. The twine\r\nused corresponds in size to the holes made by the coincidence of the\r\nbeveled saw cuts. This twine is passed through the holes by means of a\r\nblunt darning needle. The back of the book is shown in Fig. 2; and in\r\nFig. 4 the twines are represented as passed. Nothing further remains\r\nto be done but to paste in the fly-leaves and lining, and finish the\r\nbook in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this a very much stronger method of securing the\r\nleaves than that in which the twine is simply laid and glued in a\r\nstraight cut. Each leaf is independently fastened; and the thread is\r\nprevented from cutting through, as is commonly the case when the book\r\nhas been used to any great extent. Books can be bound to open more or\r\nless as desired; and in rebinding, instead of taking the book apart\r\nand cutting threads, a thin shaving is sliced off the back, and the\r\nleaves are treated in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nPatented March 20, 1877, by Mr. Florenz E. Schmitz. For further\r\ninformation, address Messrs. Schmitz and Slosson, box 1180,\r\nMiddletown, Orange county, N.

Fig. 1 represents the device in place, a portion of the\r\ncornice being broken away to exhibit it; and Fig. 2 shows the same in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improved Curtain Fixture Figs. 1 and 2]\r\n\r\nAttached to the cornice are guides, A, in which are sliding loops, B.\r\nThe latter may be adjusted to suit the position of the hooks placed in\r\nthe window case to sustain the cornice, so that said hooks need not be\r\nset with any particularity. The curtain roller, C, has both its ends\r\nscrew-threaded, to receive hollow pulleys, as shown. The spindles\r\nprojecting from these pulleys are inclosed in coiled springs which\r\npress against the bearings, D, and so hold the shade in any position\r\nin which it may be placed. The bearings, D, are clasped in the ways,\r\nA, and are laterally adjustable. Sliding blocks are also arranged in\r\nsaid ways, and through each block passes a set screw, E. It will be\r\nperceived that the bearings may be readily adjusted to curtains of\r\ndifferent widths, and the parts may afterward be locked in position by\r\nthe set screws, E. The curtain may be raised or lowered by cords wound\r\non the hollow pulleys.\r\n\r\nPatented December 5, 1876, by Mr. K. J. Pospisil.

Nearly\r\nevery operation in the complex process of evolving finished boots\r\nfrom the plain skins of leather is the object of a special class of\r\nmachinery; and for several years past, we have weekly chronicled the\r\npatenting of several improvements in the devices for effecting some\r\nof the numerous operations. We present herewith a series of eight\r\nlabor-saving machines of the most approved construction, which we\r\nselect from Knight's \"American Mechanical Dictionary.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Published in numbers by Messrs. Hurd & Houghton, New York\r\ncity.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a shoe-edge trimmer, in which the shoe is mounted on a\r\njack, the carriage of which has a motion of translation and rotation\r\ncommunicated to it: so that, while the side of the sole is being\r\ntrimmed, the shoe is fed longitudinally against the knife, but at the\r\ntoe and heel is rotated beneath it. The knife is universally jointed,\r\nto permit the hands of the operator to determine the different bevels\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 is an ingenious little machine for placing the eyelets of the\r\nlace holes in position, and fastening them. The eyelets are fed, one\r\nby one, from the reservoir at the top, down the inclined ways, and are\r\nseized at the foot between the plunger and anvil, and they are riveted\r\nin their proper places in the shoe or strip of leather, which is held\r\nand fed by the operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is a machine in which a shoe or boot is chucked and revolved\r\nagainst a burnishing tool, to impart a smooth and elegant finish to\r\nthe heel. Our engraving shows a machine with what is called in the\r\ntrade a \"hot kit,\" a heated burnishing tool, with a flexible gas pipe\r\nof sufficient length, which follows the oscillations of the burnishing\r\nstock, _a_, and which conveys gas to the interior of the tool, where\r\nit is burnt in a jet. The tool is made to reciprocate over the surface\r\nof the heel, passing from breast to breast at each oscillation with an\r\nelastic pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nFig. 4 is a machine for pressing together the \"lifts\" which compose\r\na boot or shoe heel, thus dispensing with the handiwork of the\r\nhammer and lapstone. The bed is adjusted vertically by a screw to any\r\nthickness to which the blank heel may be built; and the plunger is\r\nbrought down by the depression of the treadle with such force as to\r\ncompact the lifts together.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows a heel-pricking machine. When the lifts of the heel are\r\nfairly pressed together by the appliance shown in Fig. 4, the pricking\r\nmachine pierces the necessary holes through all the lifts at once by\r\na gang of awls. The compressed heels are first secured together by\r\ntacking, and then placed on the platen; and the plunger, with its gang\r\nof awls, descends with great force.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 is a heel trimmer, known in the trade as the Cote trimmer. The\r\nshoe is held stationary by the treadle clamp; and the knife stock,\r\nwhich is centrally pivoted to the outer plate or jaw bearing upon the\r\ntread lift, is then grasped in the hands of the operator, and moved to\r\ngive a sweeping cut to trim the heel.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is a machine for pressing boot soles. Beneath the crosshead of\r\nthe press is a swinging bed, on each end of which is a form, in order\r\nthat a shoe may remain under pressure upon one while the operator\r\nis placing another shoe on the other. The pressure is given by the\r\ntreadle, which brings down the upper platen on the channeled sole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boot and Shoe Machinery Fig. 7]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DYSPEPSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the Harveian Society, of London, Dr. Farquharson\r\nread a paper on this subject. Attention was directed to the state of\r\nthe tongue in dyspepsia. A deeply fissured tongue often meant little;\r\nwhereas a thin white fur, composed of minute dots, was generally found\r\nalong with pain immediately after food. Pain after a longer interval\r\nwas accompanied by a pale, flabby tongue, with reddish tip and center.\r\nThe treatment of dyspepsia consisted of two parts, that of food\r\nand that of drugs. The latter was the principal part with patients\r\napplying for gratuitous relief. The pain occurring immediately after\r\nfood was usually relieved by alkalies; whereas acids were indicated\r\nwhere suffering was not experienced until an hour or two after the\r\ncommencement of the digestive act. For the relief of the nausea and\r\nsickness remaining after the bowels were thoroughly cleansed, nothing\r\nwas so effectual as hourly drop doses of ipecacuanha wine. Nux vomica\r\nwas also a valuable remedy. Pain might be but the protest of the\r\nstomach against an overload, or be the result of deficient tone from\r\ngeneral nervous exhaustion. In some cases each meal was followed by\r\ndiarrh[oe]a; and for these cases attention was directed to Ringer's\r\nplan of minute doses of the liquor hydrargyri perchloridi In speaking\r\nof diet, Dr. Farquharson pointed out that there are three forms of\r\ndyspepsia: 1. The dyspepsia of fluids, as it is called, where the\r\nstomach seems intolerant of all forms of fluid; 2. The digestive\r\nderangement following intemperance in the matter of animal food; and,\r\n3. The dyspepsia connected with indulgence in tea, or other warm and\r\nweak infusions of tannin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of destruction of life and property by lightning, or rather\r\nelectrical discharges, has been very great throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that at least 45 persons are killed annually by\r\nlightning in this country. The average number of deaths by lightning\r\nhas been 22 in England, 9 in Switzerland, 3 in Belgium, and 75 in\r\nFrance. In France alone, during a period of thirty years, over 10,000\r\npersons were smitten, of which 2,252 were instantly killed. Eighty\r\nwere wounded and 9 killed during one thunderstorm at Chateauneuf les\r\nMontiers in 1861, and within one week, when the air was highly charged\r\nwith electricity, thirty-three fearful flashes of lightning were\r\nobserved, each bringing death to some victims.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteen years between 1799 and 1816, 156 vessels of the\r\nBritish navy were struck by lightning; 73 men were killed and 138\r\ninjured, and the loss of materials amounted to over a million dollars;\r\nbut since the system of metallic conductors, adapted for vessels,\r\ndevised by Sir W. Snow Harris, has been applied to the vessels in that\r\nnavy, the losses and damages by lightning have almost entirely ceased,\r\nalthough the number of vessels has been greatly increased.\r\n\r\nIn Fuller's Church History it is stated that \"scarcely a great\r\nabbey in England exists which once, at least, was not burned down by\r\nlightning from heaven.\"\r\n\r\nOn the night of April, 1718, twenty-four steeples were struck along\r\nthe coast of Brittany; and on the 11th of January, 1815, twelve\r\nsteeples suffered a similar fate in the Rhenish provinces.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of July, 1759, lightning burnt all the woodwork of the\r\ngreat cathedral at Strasbourg; and on the 14th of August, 1833, it was\r\nstruck three times within a quarter of an hour, and so much damaged\r\nthat the repairs cost about $6,000,000. In 1835 lightning conductors\r\nwere placed upon the building and steeple, and since then it has\r\nnot been damaged whatever by lightning, although discharges have on\r\nseveral occasions occurred in line with the top of the steeple, which\r\nis 437 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August, 1769, the Tower of St. Nazaire, at Brescia,\r\nwas struck, and the subterranean powder magazine, containing 2,076,000\r\nlbs. of powder, belonging to the Republic of Venice, was exploded.\r\nOne sixth of the whole town was laid in ruins and the rest very much\r\ninjured, and about 3,000 persons killed.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June, 1807, the powder magazine of Luxembourg,\r\ncontaining 28,000 lbs., was struck, and besides about 30 persons\r\nkilled and 200 injured, the town was ruined.\r\n\r\nExplosions and large fires, involving a great loss, have become rather\r\nfrequent in this country, owing to the iron tanks used for the storage\r\nof petroleum being struck by lightning. From March to August, in 1876,\r\nover 10,000,000 gallons, and on April 19, 1877, over 2,000,000 gallons\r\nof oil, and the village of Troutman, were destroyed in the oil regions\r\nof Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSome of the thunderstorms which have prevailed in this country have\r\nbeen very terrific and destructive. During August 14th, 15th, and\r\n16th, 1872, portions of New York State and the New England States were\r\nvisited by some of the most terrific thunderstorms ever experienced,\r\nduring which over 200 dwellings were struck and damaged, about 10\r\npersons were instantly killed, and 160 stunned. Quite a number of\r\nbarns, with their contents, hay and cattle, were also struck, fired,\r\nand consumed. Cars, while running on some of the railroads, were\r\nsurrounded by a vivid electric light, but no passengers were injured,\r\nalthough they were greatly alarmed. Telegraph wires were melted by the\r\nhalf mile, telegraph instruments broken, and poles shattered in all\r\ndirections. One of these storms occurred at midnight, at Arlington,\r\nMass., August 14th, in which brilliant streams of electricity darted\r\nacross the sky in every direction, and the thunder which followed was\r\nconstant for a period of thirteen minutes, without the intermission\r\nof an instant of silence. Three hundred and thirty-one discharges\r\nwere counted in seven minutes by an observer, and each discharge was\r\nfollowed by loud and sometimes rattling reports, whose reverberations\r\nrolled through the heavens in an endless procession of majestic and\r\nterrific sounds.

Pearson, which\r\narrived at Portsmouth from the Mediterranean on Monday, June 11,\r\nhas forwarded an official report to the Admiralty, through the\r\nCommander-in-Chief (Admiral Sir George Elliot, K.C.B.), respecting a\r\nsea monster which she encountered during her homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nAt about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of June 2, the sea being\r\nexceptionally calm, while the yacht was proceeding round the north\r\ncoast of Sicily toward Cape Vito, the officer on the watch observed\r\na long ridge of fins, each about 6 feet long, moving slowly along. He\r\ncalled for a telescope, and was at once joined by other officers. The\r\nOsborne was steaming westward at ten and a half knots an hour, and\r\nhaving a long passage before her, could not stay to make minute\r\nobservations. The fins were progressing in a eastwardly direction, and\r\nas the vessel more nearly approached them, they were replaced by the\r\nforemost part of a gigantic monster. Its skin was, so far as it could\r\nbe seen, altogether devoid of scales, appearing rather to resemble in\r\nsleekness that of a seal.\r\n\r\nThe head was bullet-shaped, with an elongated termination, being\r\nsomewhat similar in form to that of a seal, and was about six feet in\r\ndiameter. Its features were only seen by one officer, who described\r\nthem as like those of an alligator. The neck was comparatively narrow,\r\nbut so much of the body as could be seen, developed in form like that\r\nof a gigantic turtle, and from each side extended two fins, about\r\nfifteen feet in length, by which the monster paddled itself along\r\nafter the fashion of a turtle.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the monster is accounted for by a submarine volcano,\r\nwhich occurred north of Galita, in the Gulf of Tunis, about the middle\r\nof May, and was reported at the time by a steamer which was struck by\r\na detached fragment of submarine rock. The disturbance below water, it\r\nis thought probable, may have driven up the monster from its \"native\r\nelement,\" as the site of the eruption is only one hundred miles from\r\nwhere it was reported to have been seen--_Portsmouth (Eng.)

Probably the\r\naffection so designated is not the malady to which the term _coup de\r\nsoleil_ can be properly applied. The condition brought about is\r\nan exaggerated form of the disturbance occasioned by entering\r\ntoo suddenly the \"hot\" room of a Turkish bath. The skin does not\r\nimmediately perform its function as an evaporating and therefore\r\ncooling surface, and an acute febrile state of the organism is\r\nestablished, with a disturbed balance of circulation, and more or less\r\ncerebral irritation as a prominent feature of the complaint. Death may\r\nsuddenly occur at the outset of the complaint, as it has happened in\r\na Turkish bath, where the subject labors under some predisposition to\r\napoplexy, or has a weak or diseased heart. It should suffice to point\r\nout the danger and to explain, by way of warning, that although the\r\ndegrees of heat registered by the thermometer, or the power of the\r\nsun's rays, do not seem to suggest especial caution, all sudden\r\nchanges from a low to a high temperature are attended with danger\r\nto weak organisms. The avoidance of undue exercise--for example,\r\npersistent trotting or cantering up and down the Row--is an obvious\r\nprecaution on days marked by a relatively, if not absolutely, high\r\ntemperature. We direct attention to this matter because it is obvious\r\nthe peculiar peril of overheating the body by exertion on the first\r\nburst of fine weather is not generally realized. It is forgotten that\r\nthe increased temperature must be measured by the elevation which has\r\nrecently taken place, not the number of degrees of heat at present\r\nrecorded. The registered temperature may be more or less than that\r\nwhich occurred a year ago; but its immediate effects on the organism\r\nwill be determined by the conditions which have preceded it and the\r\nviolence of the change.--_Lancet_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAD HORSES STANDING ERECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Danville _Advertiser_ of the 7th inst. says: Mr. Smith was in\r\ntown on Saturday with his hired man, and the two tell a singular story\r\nabout a lightning stroke. Mr. Smith was on a grain drill in a field,\r\nand his hired man was about 12 rods from him, dragging. Suddenly Smith\r\nheard the noise of thunder, and became unconscious. The man also heard\r\nthe noise, but neither of them saw any flash of lightning. The\r\nman went to Smith, and in about twenty minutes he was restored to\r\nconsciousness. Then attention was given to the horses. One of them was\r\nstanding erect, with one foot lifted a little way from the earth, and\r\nthe other was kneeling with his nose in the earth, and both were stone\r\ndead, and retained their positions until they were pushed over.

G. asks: \"How can I set the slide valves of a locomotive when\r\nshe is on the road?\" J. H. S. asks: \"What is the method of setting\r\nlocomotive slide valves from marks on the slide spindle?\" And F. O.\r\nasks: \"How are the valves of inside cylinder locomotives set, since\r\nthe back ports are out of sight and you cannot measure the lead?\"\r\n\r\nOur correspondent will find these questions answered in full below.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that the lengths of the eccentric rod, reverse rod, and\r\nother parts are correct, and they are properly connected and oiled\r\nso as to be in working order. The first thing to do is to place the\r\nreverse lever in the forward full-gear notch of the quadrants, or\r\nsectors, as they are sometimes called. The next procedure is to place\r\nthe crank on its forward dead center as near as can be ascertained by\r\nthe eye, and loosening the set screw of the forward eccentric, that is\r\nto say, the eccentric which connects with the upper end of the link,\r\nmove that eccentric round on the shaft until the valve leaves the port\r\nat the front end of the cylinder open to the amount of whatever lead\r\nit is desired to give the valve. In moving the eccentric round on the\r\nshaft, it is necessary to move it in the direction in which it will\r\nturn when in operation. This is done in order to take up any lost\r\nmotion there may be in the eccentric straps, in the eccentric rod\r\neyebolts, or other working parts or joints between the eccentric and\r\nthe slide valve rod or spindle. If the eccentric was turned backward\r\ninstead of forward, all the lost motion would operate to vitiate the\r\nset of the valve, because, when the eccentric begins to move, its\r\nmotion will have no effect in moving the slide valve spindle, until\r\nall the lost motion in the various parts is taken up by the eccentric\r\nmovement. In considering this part of the operation, we must bear in\r\nmind that, to set the valve, we must move the wheels of the engine,\r\nit being impracticable to move the piston itself. Now, in moving the\r\nwheels, we are confronted with the fact that the crank pin is pulling\r\nthe connecting rod; hence, if there is any lost motion in the brasses\r\nat either end of the connecting rod, the piston will not be at the end\r\nof its stroke when the crank is on its dead center.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that we have moved the driving wheel forward\r\nuntil the crank stands upright at a right angle to the bore of the\r\ncylinder, the resistance to motion of the piston and crosshead has\r\ncaused the crank pin to bed against the half-brass nearest to the\r\ncylinder, all the play or lost motion is then between the other\r\nhalf-brass and the crank pin. When, however, the engine is at work and\r\nthe piston is driving the crank pin, instead of being driven by it,\r\nthe lost motion will exist between the crank pin and the half-brass\r\nnearest to the cylinder, and the contact will exist between the crank\r\npin and the other brass. The difference in the position of the piston,\r\ncaused by this lost motion, may be ascertained by moving the piston\r\nback and forth until the crank pin contacts with first one and then\r\nthe other half-brass. It is sometimes attempted to remedy the defect\r\ndue to this lost motion by moving the crank pin past the dead center\r\nand then moving it back to the dead center, so that while on that\r\ncenter the play or lost motion in the connecting rod is taken up. This\r\nis all very well so far as the connecting rod and piston is concerned,\r\nand will cause them both to stand on their respective dead centers\r\nwith the lost motion taken up; but, in moving the wheel back to the\r\ndead center, we have given full liberty to all the lost motion in the\r\nvarious parts of the valve motion or gear, as already explained, in\r\nreference to moving the eccentric upon the shaft. As there are so many\r\nmore parts in the valve gear, in which lost motion may occur, it is\r\nmanifestly preferable to take up that play by moving the driving wheel\r\nin a continuous direction, rather than to move the latter back to\r\naccommodate any play there may be in the connecting rod.\r\n\r\nThe crank being placed by the eye upon its forward dead center, and\r\nthe eccentric connected to the top of the link being moved round\r\non the axle (in the direction in which the wheels will run when the\r\nengine is going forward) until the steam port at the front end of the\r\ncylinder is open to the amount of the lead, we fasten the eccentric to\r\nhold in that position. We then throw the reverse lever over into the\r\nlast notch at the other end of the sector, lifting the link up so\r\nthat the eccentric connected to the lower end of the link may be\r\napproximately adjusted, which is done by moving the eccentric round\r\nupon the axle (in the direction in which the axle will revolve when\r\nthe engine is running backward) until the crank stands upon the same\r\ndead center, and the front port is open to the amount of the lead.\r\nThis being done, we have the eccentrics approximately adjusted and may\r\nproceed to the final adjustment, in which the first thing to do is to\r\nfind the exact dead centers of the crank. It is obvious that a line\r\ndrawn through the center of the crank pin and the center of the wheel\r\naxle, will stand horizontally true and level when the crank is on\r\neither of the dead centers, but the presence of the crank pin makes\r\nit impracticable to draw such a line. We can therefore draw one which\r\nwill be parallel to those centers; and to do this we draw a circle\r\nupon the end of the wheel axle (and from its center) of the same\r\ndiameter as that of the crank pin, and then resting a straight-edge\r\nupon the bearing of the crank pin (taking care to avoid the round\r\ncorner upon the pin, if there is one), we place the other end of the\r\nstraight-edge even with the top of the circle drawn upon the axle; and\r\nthen, using the straight-edge as a guide, we draw a line across the\r\nend of the axle and the wheel face. When this line is level the crank\r\nwill be upon its dead center. This plan is sometimes employed, but is\r\nnot a very accurate one, because the length of the line is very short\r\nas compared to the circumference of the driving wheel; hence, an error\r\nof the thickness of the line becomes one equal to several thicknesses\r\nof the line when carried out to the wheel circumference. Furthermore,\r\nif the line of the cylinder does not stand horizontally level, as\r\nis sometimes the case, the result of the whole proceeding will be\r\ninaccurate. Again, the connecting rod end and the coupling rod is in\r\nthe way, rendering it awkward to both draw and level the line.\r\n\r\nA better and more accurate method to find the dead centers is as\r\nfollows: Place the reverse lever into the end notch of the sector at\r\nthe forward end, and then move the driving wheel forward until the\r\nguide block is within about a quarter of an inch of the end of its\r\ntravel, then place a straight-edge against the end of the guide block,\r\nand draw, on the outside face of the guide bar, a line even with the\r\nend of the guide block. Bend a piece of wire (pointed at both ends) to\r\na right angle, make a center punch mark either in the rail, under the\r\ndriving wheel, or in some stationary, solid part contiguous to the\r\nwheel, or at such distance from it that when one end of the bent wire\r\nis placed in the center punch mark, the operator with the other end\r\nwill be able to draw a line across the rim of the driving wheel. Here,\r\nhowever, arises another consideration, that it is better to set the\r\nvalves with the wheel axle in its proper position in the pedestal\r\nshoes, and in order to do this the wheel should rest upon the rail\r\nwith its proper proportion of the weight of the engine resting upon\r\nit. The springs will then be deflected to their proper amount, and the\r\naxle box will have passed its proper distance up the pedestals. It is\r\nobvious that if the engine is blocked up so that the driving wheels\r\nclear the rails (which is done in order to avoid having the weight of\r\nthe engine to move while setting the valve), the axle boxes will drop\r\nin the pedestal and the valve will be set incorrectly, as the wheels\r\nare in a wrong position. To avoid this, and at the same time to avoid\r\nhaving to move the whole engine while setting the valve, the engine\r\nis blocked up from the rails, and the axle boxes of the driving wheels\r\nare wedged up so as to be lifted up into their proper position. In\r\nthis case there is no very accurate means of ascertaining what is\r\nthe exact proper height, save it be by first marking upon the outside\r\nfaces of the shoes or pedestal a line even with the top of the axle\r\nbox when the load is upon the wheels, and then, after blocking up the\r\nengine from the rails, wedging up the axle boxes till the face again\r\ncomes even with the line.\r\n\r\nWhatever plan is pursued, one end of the piece of wire is rested in\r\nthe fixed center punch mark, and with the other a line is drawn across\r\nthe outside face of the wheel rim. The driving wheel is then revolved\r\nforward until the guide block returns, having passed to the end of its\r\ntravel. When its end again stands exactly even with the mark made upon\r\nthe guide bar, the piece of wire is again brought into requisition,\r\none end being rested in the fixed center punch mark as before, and\r\nwith the other end another line is drawn across the outside rim of the\r\nwheel. It is obvious that by taking a pair of compasses and finding a\r\npoint exactly equidistant between the two lines thus marked upon the\r\nwheel rim, and then marking that point with a center punch mark, the\r\ncrank will be upon its exact dead center, when one end of the piece of\r\nbent wire rests in the fixed center punch mark, the other end rests\r\nin the center punch mark upon the wheel rim. To find the other dead\r\ncenter, the wheel must be moved about halfway round and the process\r\nrepeated with the motion block at the other end of the guide bars.\r\n\r\nThus, whenever the piece of wire will stand with one end resting in\r\nthe fixed center punch mark and the other end in either of the center\r\npunch marks upon the wheel run, the crank is upon a dead center.\r\nHaving thus placed the crank upon either dead center, we measure the\r\nvalve lead, and if in temporarily fixing our eccentrics we gave it too\r\nmuch lead, we mark where it stands upon the shaft by means of a line\r\ndrawn on the axle and carried up on the side face of the eccentric;\r\nthen move the eccentric back some little distance more than is\r\nnecessary to make the adjustment, and then move it forward again a\r\nlittle at a time, noting when the valve has the proper amount of lead,\r\nand thus fasten the eccentric upon the axle by means of the set screw.\r\n\r\nThe object of moving the eccentric too far back and then moving it\r\nforward is to make the adjustment so that the latter may be made with\r\nthe lost motion of the valve gear all taken up. The next proceeding is\r\nto move the driving wheel halfway round and try the lead at that end\r\nof the stroke. If the lead at the two ends is not equal, it shows that\r\neither the slide valve spindle or the eccentric rods are not of the\r\nproper length and must be rectified; this being done, the crank must\r\nbe again placed upon first one and then the other dead center, the\r\nvalve lead being measured at each end. When the lead is equal at each\r\nend, the rods are of correct length, and the amount of the lead must\r\nbe regulated by moving the eccentrics as already directed.\r\n\r\nIf the link block does not come opposite the end of the eccentric rod\r\nwhen the reverse lever is in the end notch of the sector, the length\r\nof the reverse rod is wrong and should be corrected. If the link block\r\ncomes right, under the above conditions, for the forward but not for\r\nthe backward eccentric rod, the notches in the sector are not cut\r\nin their proper positions, or the link hanger is not of the proper\r\nlength. In either case the error may be remedied by altering the\r\nlength of the latter. But, as doing this would alter the amount of the\r\nvalve lead, it is well, if there is any prospect of such errors, to\r\ncorrect them before setting the valves.\r\n\r\nInstead of measuring the lead of the valve with a rule, or by a wedge,\r\nthe following plan is very often adopted: After the valve and spindle\r\nare in position, the valve is placed with the proper amount of lead\r\nupon the front port. A center punch mark is then made upon the face\r\nof the steam chest. A piece of quarter inch iron wire is then bent at\r\nright angles and each end filed to a point. One end of this wire is\r\nplaced in the fixed center punch mark in the steam chest, and with the\r\nother a mark is made upon the slide spindle. Upon this latter mark a\r\ncenter punch mark is also made sufficiently deep to be very plainly\r\nvisible when the burr raised by center punching is filed off, which\r\nis necessary to prevent this burr from cutting the packing. It follows\r\nthat whenever the bent piece of wire will rest with one end in the\r\ncenter punch mark in the steam chest, and the other end in the center\r\npunch mark in the slide spindle, the valve is in its proper position\r\nwhen the crank is on the corresponding dead center. This plan is a\r\nvery old one and possesses the advantage that the valve may be set\r\nwithout seeing it, that is to say, with the steam chest cover on. If\r\nthe length of the piece of wire measured direct from point to point is\r\nknown, the valve may be set when the engine is upon the road without\r\ntaking off the steam chest cover. The center punch mark upon the steam\r\nchest should, however, always be placed in about the same spot, so as\r\nto avoid mistakes in case of there being other similar marks upon the\r\nchest. It should always be made deep, so as not to get filled up with\r\npaint and be difficult to find. In course of time the mark upon the\r\nslide valve spindle is apt to disappear from the wear of the spindle,\r\nhence the center punch with which it is made should have a long\r\nconical point. To mark the position of the eccentric upon the axle,\r\nit is an excellent plan, after the eccentrics are finally adjusted,\r\nto take a chisel with the cutting end ground to the form of a fiddle\r\ndrill, one cutting edge being at a right angle to the other. The\r\nchisel must be held so that while one edge rests upon the axle, the\r\nother edge will bear against the radial face of the eccentric. A sharp\r\nblow with a hammer upon the chisel-head will make a clean indented cut\r\nupon the axle and the eccentric, the two cuts exactly meeting at their\r\njunction and denoting the position of the eccentrics. In setting the\r\nvalves of inside cylinder locomotives, the back ports being out of\r\nsight, the amount of lead is ascertained by making a wooden wedge\r\nabout three inches long, a thirty-second of an inch thick at one end\r\nand three eighths of an inch thick at the other end. The faces of this\r\nwedge are chalked, and the lead is measured by inserting it between\r\nthe edge of the valve and the edge of the port until its thickness\r\njust fills the space, and then moving it edgeways so that the valve\r\nand port edges will just mark it. By measuring the thickness of the\r\nwedge at the mark, the amount of lead is ascertained. After the valves\r\nare set, it is still desirable to mark the position by center\r\npunch marks upon the outside of the steam chests and upon the valve\r\nspindles, as already described.\r\n\r\nIf an eccentric should slip when the engine is upon the road,\r\nand there are no marks whereby to readjust them, it may be done\r\napproximately as follows: Put the reverse lever in the end notch of\r\nthe forward gear, then place the crank as nearly on a dead center as\r\nthe eye will direct, and open both the cylinder cocks, then disconnect\r\nthe slide valve spindle from the rocker arm, and move the valve\r\nspindle until the opening of the port corresponding to the dead center\r\non which the crank stands will be shown by steam blowing through the\r\ncylinder cock, the throttle valve being opened a trifle. The position\r\nof the valve being thus determined, the eccentric must be moved upon\r\nthe shaft until the valve spindle will connect with the rocker arm\r\nwithout being moved at all. The throttle valve should be very slightly\r\nopened, otherwise so much steam will be admitted into the cylinder\r\nthat it will pass through any leak in the piston and blow through\r\nboth cylinder cocks before there is time to ascertain which cock gives\r\nfirst exit to the steam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STEAMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new steamer for the Mallory line, between New York and Texas, was\r\nlately launched from the yard of Roach & Co., Chester, Pa., 2,200 tons\r\nburden.

W. Collender, the well known billiard\r\ntable manufacturer of this city. The first, which is represented in\r\nFig. 1, relates to the construction of the bed-supporting frame, and\r\naims to render the same stronger while cheapening its manufacture.\r\nIn putting together the body and framework of the table, the usual\r\npractice is to cut away the stock of the cross beam and longitudinal\r\nbeam, and halve them together. Longitudinal grooves are also formed on\r\nthe inner surface of the side and \"broad rails,\" to accommodate tenons\r\non the ends of the cross beams; and the latter are secured in place\r\nby bolts fastening their ends to the broad rails. Mr. Collender claims\r\nthat, by this mode of construction, not only are the cross beams\r\nweakened by being halved together, but the broad rails are also\r\nweakened by the cutting away of this stock near the middle to effect\r\nthe framing into them of the ends of the cross beams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 1, billiard table support frame]\r\n\r\nFrom Fig. 1, it will be seen that the cross beam, A, is combined with\r\nthe side broad rails in the following manner: Upon the inner face of\r\neach broad rail is secured a cast iron socket piece, B, into which\r\nfits one end of the cross beam, A. From said beam the bolt, C, passes\r\nthrough the shoe, B, and is secured by a nut, D, let into the stock of\r\nthe broad rail. The shoe, B, has lugs which enter the broad rail; and\r\nthe aperture in it, through which the bolt passes, is made oblong to\r\nadmit of the drawing of the parts together after the insertion of the\r\nbolt. Upon the sides of the cross beam near the middle, and directly\r\nopposite each other, are two shoes, E; these have no bolt holes. In\r\nthem are placed the adjacent ends of the longitudinal beams, F, the\r\nother extremities of which are seated in shoes on the broad rails.\r\nThe shoes, E, have their lugs of such a length, compared with the\r\nthickness of cross beam, A, that when put in place on said beam said\r\nlugs will come together. The advantage of this is that, should the\r\nbeam, A, shrink in width, the shoes on each side of it will still\r\nmaintain their proper relation to form immovable abutments for the\r\nends of pieces, F. This construction allows of shorter stuff being\r\nused in the manufacture, and renders the framework stronger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2, billiard table frame corner]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2 is illustrated a new method of forming the corners of the\r\ntable. Hitherto it has been customary to use corner blocks, of various\r\nsizes according to the dimensions of the table, located one at each\r\ncorner. Into these the broad rails were framed and secured. To this\r\narrangement Mr. Collender adduces a long category of objections, based\r\non the possibility of the weight of the bed being thrown on these\r\nblocks in case of shrinkage of the frame, on the fact that the corner\r\nof the table bed must necessarily be left without any support where\r\nit extends over the upper end of the corner block, and also that in\r\na bevel table, in which the area of the top of the corner block is\r\nunavoidably much greater than that of the top of the corner block of\r\na vertical-sided table, a large portion of the table bed will be left\r\nwithout any support.\r\n\r\nThe new device consists of a cast iron union plate, G, which is bolted\r\nto the leg as shown. The broad rails and casting are securely fastened\r\nby the bolt, H. It will be seen that this bolt, passing through the\r\nend of one broad rail, and into a nut let into the other rail,\r\nwill securely draw and hold together the ends of said rails and the\r\ninterposed metal plate clamped between them, and that as the plain\r\nends of the wooden rails just fit (widthwise) between the projecting\r\nheads on the edges of said interposed plate, the latter will form a\r\nsort of housing for the ends of the rails. And it will be understood\r\nthat in this construction not only does the bead on the outer edge of\r\nthe plate overlap the edges of the rails and form a neat and durable\r\ncorner finish to the body, but the broad rails being bolted together\r\nin the direction of the grain of the wood with only an interposed\r\nmetal plate, there will be no tendency to a loosening of the union of\r\nthe parts of the frame. The main importance of this invention rests\r\nin the idea of dispensing with the usual corner blocks, and thus\r\npermitting the top edges of the broad rails, on which the bed rests,\r\nto practically come together and afford a perfect support to the bed\r\nclear out to the corners of the latter; at the same time the whole\r\nstructure is rendered stronger and more durable with less weight of\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThese inventions are the subject of separate patents, that of the\r\nfirst being dated April 4, 1876, and of the second, November 16, 1875.\r\nFor further information, address the manufacturer and patentee, Mr. H.\r\nW. Collender, 738 Broadway, New York city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOATING ENGRAVED COPPER PLATES WITH STEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to render copper plates which are used in printing more\r\ndurable, they can be covered with an electrolytic deposit of iron\r\nwhich possesses an unusual degree of hardness almost superior to\r\nsteel. The salt usually employed has been the double sulphate of iron\r\nand ammonia. Professor Boettger, who first invented this process, has\r\nrecently devised an improvement in the bath employed. He dissolves 10\r\nparts of ferrocyanide of potassium (yellow prussiate of potash) and\r\n20 parts of the double tartrate of soda and potash (Rochelle salts) in\r\n200 parts of water, and to this he adds 3 parts of persulphate of iron\r\ndissolved in 50 parts of water. A large precipitate of Prussian\r\nblue is formed. To the whole is added, drop by drop, with constant\r\nstirring, a solution of caustic soda until the blue precipitate\r\nentirely disappears, leaving a perfectly clear, light yellow liquid,\r\nwhich is now ready for use.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boettger also claims that this solution can be employed with\r\nadvantage for dyeing cotton yarn and fabrics a beautiful blue, without\r\nthe use of a mordant. For this purpose the goods are put into the\r\nbath, that has previously been slightly warmed, until they are\r\nsaturated through and through, and then dried in the air, after which\r\nthey are immersed in extremely dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 50), which\r\nneutralizes the alkali, and after washing and drying again they are\r\npermanently dyed a fine blue color.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST FOR SULPHUR IN ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. Vohl recommends the following as the best method of detecting\r\nsulphur in organic compounds: The substance to be tested is heated in\r\na solution of caustic lime and oxide of lead in glycerin. The latter\r\nis prepared as follows: One volume of distilled water is mixed with\r\n2 volumes of pure glycerin and heated to boiling; freshly prepared\r\nslaked lime is added, little by little, until it is saturated. Freshly\r\nprecipitated hydrated oxide of lead, or moist litharge, is added in\r\nexcess, and the liquid allowed to boil gently for a few minutes,\r\nthen tightly corked and left to cool, after which the clear liquid\r\nis decanted from the sediment into a glass vessel that can be tightly\r\ncorked. If into this solution be introduced and heated any organic\r\nwhich contains sulphur, like hair, feathers, horn, albumen, and the\r\nlike, it will at once turn black from the formation of sulphide of\r\nlead. The great delicacy of this test is evident from the fact that,\r\nwhen pure wheat bread is boiled with this reagent, it turns yellow at\r\nfirst and then dark gray in consequence of the presence of sulphur in\r\nthe gluten of the bread.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BILLIARD BALL HOLDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usual receptacle for the fourth ball, when only three balls are\r\nused in the game of billiards, is placed at the side of the table. As\r\nthis is both inconvenient and unsightly, a neat device, clearly shown\r\nin the annexed illustration, has been invented, which is intended to\r\nbe attached to a gas fixture over the table. A plate or sign is also\r\nadded on which the number of a table--in case several tables are\r\nemployed, as in a billiard saloon--may be inscribed. The form and\r\ndesign of the arrangement may of course be varied in many ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: billiard ball holder]\r\n\r\nPatented May 2, 1876.

It may be adjusted to remain in any desired position.\r\n\r\nThe shank is pivoted in a metallic frame which is secured to the\r\ntable. The rear end of the shank works against a spring. On the upper\r\nportion of the shank is a projection which embraces a horizontal\r\nflange to sustain the box against being forced downward. The\r\narrangement is very similar to the ordinary window catch. The player\r\nhas only to start the box from its position under the table, when\r\nthe spring carries it out at right angles to the rail. A touch is\r\nsufficient to cause the spring to carry the box back to its former\r\nposition. The device is very simple, and its advantages will be\r\nevident to all billiard players cognizant of the defects of the\r\nordinary cup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONITOR CHALK CUP.]\r\n\r\nPatented May 1, 1877.

It is a true trap in one\r\nsense--inasmuch as it captures the victim which ventures near it; but\r\nit relies on little or no mechanical means for securing its prey, but\r\nstupefies the living insect by its odor. The flower is horn-shaped,\r\nabout 11 inches in length, with an opening some 5 inches in diameter.\r\nThe color within is a dull dark violet, while the interior of the\r\nspathe is lined with black, hooked bristles, the whole appearance\r\nof the flower being thoroughly repulsive. The illustrations herewith\r\npresented, Figs. 1 and 2, represent it at one third its natural\r\nsize, Fig. 2 showing a section of the flower. It is not certain what\r\nattracts the insects, which are usually of the species known as the\r\nmeat fly and the common house fly. They do not seem to seek for the\r\nsmall quantity of nectar concealed, and yet they cluster about the\r\nfatal opening, as if drawn by some overpowering fascination. Overcome\r\nby lethargy, they fall inert upon the flower, are lightly held by the\r\nbristles, and finally die asphyxiated by the carbonic acid which the\r\nplant disengages in large quantities during its inflorescence. Strange\r\nas is the action of the _arum_, the method whereby the _mentzelia_\r\ntakes its prey is even more wonderful. To illustrate on a magnified\r\nscale, let the reader imagine a surface thickly covered with strong\r\niron posts, on the sides of which are numerous keen barbs pointing\r\ndownward. Then between these posts, suppose that jars overflowing with\r\nhoney are placed. An elephant, let it be imagined, attracted by the\r\nprofusion of sweetness, inserts his trunk between the posts and\r\nfinds easy access to the honey. But while he can force his proboscis\r\ndownward past the barbs turned in that direction, when he attempts to\r\nwithdraw it he finds the keen points catch in the flesh, and render\r\nit impossible to do so. A terrible struggle follows, the unfortunate\r\nanimal twisting and writhing in every direction, until finally by\r\nan Herculean effort the head is torn from the body, and the latter\r\nbecomes digested by some potent gastric juice, exuding from the\r\ncolossal organism of which the trap forms but a portion. Of course\r\nthis is vastly exaggerated, and it would puzzle an elephant to pull\r\nhis own head off; but if for the post studded trap, we substitute the\r\nsurface of a flower, and if we replace the elephant by a fly, we shall\r\nhave conceived an accurate picture of what takes place in the peculiar\r\nreceptacle with which Nature has provided the _mentzelia ornata_.\r\nThis is very beautifully shown in Fig. 3; and at A, in same figure,\r\nis represented the barbed bristles grasping the highly magnified\r\nproboscis of the fly. Between the barbed bristles are mushroom-shaped\r\nprojections, from the summits of which a viscous nectar exudes. This\r\nis the honey bait which induces the insect to insert his trunk between\r\nthe fatal barbs. There is still another plant, _physianthus albens_,\r\nwhich captures butterflies by grasping the proboscis. The construction\r\nof the flower is quite complicated, so that the insects are compelled\r\nto insert their trunks through a narrow and winding passage in order\r\nto reach the nectar. The organ then necessarily comes in contact with\r\nan adhesive substance, which prevents its removal.\r\n\r\nThe _Gronovia scandens_, Fig. 4, is another plant trap, which catches\r\nno flies nor possesses any such wonderfully adapted devices as the\r\nplants already described. It simply has its branches covered with\r\ndouble barbed bristles of great strength which attach themselves to\r\nanything brought in contact with them. The bristles are strong enough\r\nto hold lizards, as represented by our engraving, the points inserting\r\nthemselves in the interstices of the scaly covering of the reptile.\r\nOf course the lizard thus held starves to death, and small birds\r\noften follow a like fate. We are indebted to _La Nature_ for the\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1 and 2.--ARUM DRACUNCULUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--MENTZELIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--GRONOVIA SCANDENS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR FALLACIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNight air and damp weather are held in great horror by multitudes\r\nof persons who are sickly or of weak constitutions; consequently, by\r\navoiding the night air, and damp weather, and changeable weather, and\r\nweather that is considered too hot or too cold, they are kept within\r\ndoors the much largest portion of their time, and as a matter of\r\ncourse continue invalids, more and more ripening for the grave\r\nevery hour; the reason is, they are breathing an impure atmosphere\r\nnineteen-twentieths of their whole existence.\r\n\r\nAs nothing can wash us clean but pure water, so nothing can cleanse\r\nthe blood, nothing can make health-giving blood, but the agency of\r\npure air. So great is the tendency of the blood to become impure in\r\nconsequence of waste and useless matters mixing with it as it passes\r\nthrough the body, that it requires a hogshead of air every hour of our\r\nlives to unload it of these impurities; but in proportion as this air\r\nis vitiated, in such proportion does it infallably fail to relieve the\r\nblood of these impurities, and impure blood is the foundation of all\r\ndisease. The great fact that those who are out of doors most, summer\r\nand winter, day and night, rain or shine, have the best health the\r\nworld over, does of itself falsify the general impression that night\r\nair or any other out-door air is unhealthy as compared with in-door\r\nair at the same time.\r\n\r\nAir is the great necessity of life; so much so, that if deprived of it\r\nfor a moment, we perish; and so constant is the necessity of the\r\nblood for contact with the atmosphere, that every drop in the body is\r\nexposed to the air through the medium of the lungs every two minutes\r\nand a half of our existence.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the impurity of the out-door air of any locality,\r\nthe in-door air of that locality is still more impure, because of\r\nthe dust, and decaying and odoriferous matters which are found in\r\nall dwellings. Besides, how can in-door air be more healthy than the\r\nout-door air, other things being equal, when the dwelling is supplied\r\nwith air from without?\r\n\r\nTo this very general law there is one exception, which it is of the\r\nhighest importance to note. When the days are hot, and the nights\r\ncool, there are periods of time within each twenty-four hours, when\r\nit is safest to be in-doors, with doors and windows closed; that is to\r\nsay, for the hour or two including sunrise and sunset, because about\r\nsunset the air cools, and the vapors which the heats of the day have\r\ncaused to ascend far above us, condense and settle near the surface of\r\nthe earth, so as to be breathed by the inhabitants; as the night grows\r\ncolder, these vapors sink lower, and are within a foot or two of the\r\nearth, so they are not breathed. As the sun rises, these same vapors\r\nare warmed, and begin to ascend, to be breathed again, but as the\r\nair becomes warmer, they are carried so far above our heads as to\r\nbe innocuous. Thus it is that the old citizens of Charleston, S.\r\nC., remember, that while it was considered important to live in\r\nthe country during the summer, the common observation of the people\r\noriginated the custom of riding into town, not in the cool of the\r\nevening or of the morning, but in the middle of the day. They did not\r\nunderstand the philosophy, but they observed the fact that those who\r\ncame to the city at mid-day remained well, while those who did so\r\nearly or late suffered from it.\r\n\r\nAll strangers at Rome are cautioned not to cross the Pontine marshes\r\nafter the heat of the day is over. Sixteen of a ship's crew, touching\r\nat one of the West India islands, slept on shore several nights, and\r\nthirteen of them died of yellow fever in a few days, while of two\r\nhundred and eighty, who were freely ashore during the day, not a\r\nsingle case of illness occurred. The marshes above named are crossed\r\nin six or eight hours, and many travelers who do it in the night\r\nare attacked with mortal fevers. This does, at first sight, seem to\r\nindicate that night air _is_ unwholesome, at least in the locality\r\nof virulent malarias, but there is no direct proof that the air about\r\nsunrise and sunset is not that which is productive of the mischief.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of eliciting the observations of intelligent men, we\r\npresent our theory on this subject.\r\n\r\nA person might cross these marshes with impunity, who would set out on\r\nhis journey an hour or two after sundown, and finish it an hour or two\r\nbefore sun-up, especially if he began that journey on a hearty meal,\r\nbecause, in this way, he would be traveling in the cool of the night,\r\nwhich coolness keeps the malaria so near the surface of the earth as\r\nto prevent its being breathed to a hurtful extent.\r\n\r\nBut if it is deadly to sleep out of doors all night in a malarial\r\nlocality, would it be necessarily fatal to sleep in a house in such\r\na locality? It would not. It would be safer to sleep in the house,\r\nespecially if the windows and doors were closed. The reason is, that\r\nthe house has been warmed during the day, and if kept closed, it\r\nremains much warmer during the night indoors than it is outdoors;\r\nconsequently, the malaria is kept by this warmth so high above the\r\nhead, and so rarefied, as to be comparatively harmless. This may\r\nseem to some too nice a distinction altogether, but it will be found\r\nthroughout the world of Nature that the works of the Almighty are most\r\nstrikingly beautiful in their _minutae_, and these _minutae_ are the\r\nfoundation of His mightiest manifestations.\r\n\r\nThus it is, too, that what we call fever and ague might be banished\r\nfrom the country as a general disease, if two things were done. 1.\r\nHave a fire kindled every morning at daylight, from spring to fall,\r\nin the family room, to which all the family should repair from their\r\nchambers, and there remain until breakfast is taken. 2. Let a fire\r\nbe kindled in the family room a short time before sundown; let every\r\nmember of the family repair to it, and there remain until supper is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the philosophy of the course marked out consists in two\r\nthings. First. The fire rarefies the malaria and causes it to ascend\r\nabove the breathing point. Second. The food taken into the stomach\r\ncreates an activity of circulation which repels disease.--_Hall's\r\nJournal of Health_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENSION OF THE PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur recent English medical exchanges mention, with undisguised\r\napprehension, the fact that already early this spring authentic\r\nobservers state that the plague has broken out in Bagdad, and is\r\nrapidly increasing there; and information from other sources renders\r\nit probable that the disease has shown itself in other places in the\r\nvicinity of that city, some of which have not suffered before since\r\nthe new development of the disease in Mesopotamia, three or four years\r\nago. The progress of the epidemic in and about Bagdad last year shows\r\nthat each year since its reappearance in that district it has covered\r\na wider area, and it will be remembered that last year it crossed the\r\nTurco-Persian frontier, and broke out at Shuster, in Khuzistan. From\r\nthe phenomena of the epidemic to this period it was feared, especially\r\nby the physicians on the spot, that, if it should recur in the present\r\nyear, it must be expected to extend over a still wider area, and show\r\nitself in even a more aggravated form than had yet been observed. This\r\nopinion is concurred in by Surgeon-Major Colville, the medical officer\r\nattached to the British Embassy at Bagdad, and is expressed in his\r\nofficial report, on the subject of the last and previous year's\r\noutbreak.\r\n\r\nThe Turco-Russian struggle in Asia Minor, and the massing of Persian\r\ntroops on the western frontier of that country, add an additional and\r\nmost grave factor to this ominous intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt has been so long since Christian Europe has suffered from this\r\nterrible disease that most medical men have never seen a case, and,\r\nindeed, for awhile, epidemiologists flattered themselves it had \"died\r\nout.\" They yet say that a thorough system of sanitation will certainly\r\ncheck its advance.\r\n\r\nLet us hope so; for of all pestilences which have ever scourged\r\nhumanity, and desolated empires, none approach in magnitude those of\r\nthe plague. Under the name of \"the black death,\" it fills, as Hirsch\r\nremarks, one of the darkest pages in the history of the human race.\r\nIt devastated every known country of the earth, and penetrated to the\r\nremotest mountain hamlets and granges, sometimes sweeping away in a\r\nfew days every inhabitant, leaving not one to remember the name or to\r\ninherit the goods of the family or the village. Long years afterward,\r\ntravelers would come upon these unknown villages, the houses rotting,\r\nthe bones of the plague-stricken owners bleaching in the rooms and\r\nstreets, and no one to say who they had been.\r\n\r\nAs an epidemic disease, it no doubt spreads from India, that mother of\r\npestilence, where, in the province of Kutch and Guzerat, it is found\r\nas an endemic of great malignancy. Far more fatal in its historical\r\nappearance than the cholera, it is well that the medical mind of\r\nEurope is on the alert to meet its approach with the most energetic\r\nmeasures; and should they fail, it will devolve upon us to lose\r\nno time in taking up the defensive in the most energetic\r\nmanner.--_Medical and Surgical Reporter._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compulsory school laws of Prussia are frequently pointed to as\r\nmodels for similar laws, perhaps with the hope that by imitating her\r\nlower schools we can bring up our high schools to an equal rank with\r\nhers, and place our universities on a level with those which are\r\nproducing the most finished scholars, the deepest thinkers, and the\r\ngreatest investigators. We are likely to forget that the conditions\r\nare different, and especially that _nascitur, non fit_, is as true of\r\na chemist as of a poet.

It is then thrown into boiling water, and after the\r\nbath has partially cooled the materials to be bleached are introduced\r\nand the bath kept at a temperature of 86 deg. Fah. to 194 deg. Fah. for two\r\nhours; silk from wild silkworms requiring a higher temperature than\r\nwool, goat's hair, and the like. It is then taken out and washed, put\r\ninto an acid bath, then washed again. If necessary, the barium bath\r\nis repeated, as also the subsequent washings. If this second bath of\r\nbinoxide of barium does not produce the requisite whiteness, it is\r\nintroduced into a solution of permanganic acid or permanganate of\r\nmagnesia before the last washing.\r\n\r\nBinoxide of Barium, BaO_{2}, is made by subjecting the oxide or\r\ncaustic baryta, BaO, to a stream of oxygen or common air at a high\r\ntemperature. Its bleaching action is probably due to the formation of\r\nperoxide of hydrogen in solution in the bath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ALLOY OF TIN AND PHOSPHORUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Graupen Tin Works, in Bohemia, an alloy of tin and phosphorus\r\nis made containing the greatest possible quantity of phosphorus which\r\nthe tin is able to retain without losing any of it upon repeated\r\nmeltings. This compound, which is neither entitled to the name of\r\nalloy nor is it a phosphide of tin, is employed in the manufacture\r\nof phosphorus-bronze. In the manufacture of phosphorus-bronze, by\r\nalloying copper with phosphorus-tin, no other precautions require to\r\nbe observed than in the preparation of common bronze. As the different\r\nproperties of phosphorus-bronze depend upon the proportions of\r\nphosphorus and of tin, two kinds of phosphorus-tin are prepared. No.\r\n0 contains 5 per cent., and No. 1, 21/2 per cent. of phosphorus. These two\r\nkinds suffice to make the greater part of all the desired mixtures.\r\nFor special purposes, the Graupen Works make to order phosphorus-tin\r\nwith any desired quantity of phosphorus not exceeding 5 per\r\ncent., which is the highest possible limit. It is claimed\r\nthat phosphorus-bronze may be manufactured by the use of this\r\nphosphorus-tin as much as 40 per cent. cheaper than that now in the\r\nmarket, while it will only cost 8 per cent. more than the ordinary tin\r\nand copper bronze.\r\n\r\nNo details are given of the method employed to make the phosphorus\r\ncombine with tin, but the low melting point of tin as compared with\r\nthat of copper would indicate that this would lead to the great saving\r\npromised above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN INSTITUTE EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forty-sixth Exhibition of this Institute will open September 12,\r\nin this city.

A country\r\nthat, like New South Wales, is rolling in wealth must be a country\r\nthat is able to buy, and a country that is able to buy is exactly the\r\ncountry that American manufacturers have been anxiously looking out\r\nfor. Our representatives at Philadelphia have come back strongly\r\nimpressed with the fact that there are many things that the Americans\r\ncan supply us with advantage. Our Government has an offer from Messrs.\r\nBaldwin & Co. to furnish a locomotive engine for about L1,000 less\r\nthan the cost of an English engine, and to leave the payment open\r\nuntil the engine has been thoroughly proved and approved. A Pullman's\r\nsleeping car and an ordinary passenger car have already been ordered,\r\nand American wheels, axles, rails, and brakes are strongly pressed\r\non our acceptance. As our Government engineers are all of the English\r\nschool, American novelties will have a hard battle to fight to\r\nwin official acceptance, but the demand for economy in railway\r\nconstruction and working is so great that people and Parliament will\r\npress on the Minister for Public Works a fair trial for any American\r\nnovelties that may seem to be suited to our wants. The English\r\nmanufacturers, therefore, who have hitherto supplied us must look to\r\ntheir laurels.--_Capital and Labor_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN'S PLACE IN NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning man's true place in Nature, Haeckel says:\r\n\r\n\"Whatever part of the body we consider, we find upon the most exact\r\nexamination that man is more nearly related to the highest apes than\r\nare the latter to the lowest apes. It would therefore be wholly forced\r\nand unnatural to regard man in the zoological system as constituting a\r\ndistinct order, and thus to separate him from the true ape. Rather is\r\nthe scientific zoologist compelled, whether it is agreeable to him or\r\nnot, to rank man within the order of the true ape (Simiae).\"\r\n\r\nTo whatever minutiae of detail the comparison is carried, we reach in\r\nevery case the same result. Between man and the anthropoid apes there\r\nare the closest anatomical and physiological resemblances. In form\r\nand function, there is the most exact agreement between all the\r\ncorresponding bones of the skeleton of each; the same arrangement\r\nand structure of the muscles, nerves and entire viscera, and of\r\nthe spleen, liver and lungs--the latter being a matter of especial\r\nsignificance, for between the manner of breathing and the process of\r\nnutrition there is the closest relation.\r\n\r\nThe brain, also, is subject to the same laws of development, and\r\ndiffers only with regard to size. The minute structure of the skin,\r\nnails, and even the hair, is identical in character. Although man\r\nhas lost the greater part of his hairy covering, as Darwin thinks, in\r\nconsequence of sexual selection, yet the rudimentary hairs upon the\r\nbody correspond, in many respects, to those of the anthropoids. The\r\nformation of the beard is the same in both cases; while the face and\r\nears remain bare. Anthropoids and men become grayhaired in old age.\r\nBut the most remarkable circumstance is that, upon the upper arm, the\r\nhairs are, in both cases, directed downward, and upon the lower arm\r\nupward; while in the case of the half-apes it is different, and not as\r\nsoft as that of man and the anthropoids.\r\n\r\nThe eye, on account of its delicate structure, is peculiarly\r\nsuitable for comparisons of this kind; and we find here the greatest\r\nsimilarity: even inflammation and green cataract occur under the same\r\ncircumstances, in both. See, also, Darwin upon this point.\r\n\r\nThere is no more striking proof that man and the anthropoid apes have\r\nthe same anatomical and physiological nature, and require the same\r\nfood, than the similarity of their blood. Under the microscope the\r\nblood corpuscles are identical in form and appearance; while those of\r\nthe carnivora are clearly different from them.\r\n\r\nIt may now be interesting, in confirmation of what has been said, to\r\nrefer to the family life, and, if one may so speak, to the mental\r\nand moral life of the anthropoids. Like man, the ape provides with\r\nexceeding care for its young, so that its parental affection has\r\nbecome proverbial. Connubial fidelity is a general and well known\r\nvirtue. The mother ape leads its young to the water, and washes its\r\nface and hands in spite of its crying. Wounds are also washed out with\r\nwater. The ape, when in distress, will weep like a human being, and\r\nin a manner that is said to be very affecting. Young apes manifest\r\nthe same tendencies as human children. When domesticated, they are\r\nin youth docile and teachable, and also, at times, like all children,\r\ndisobedient. In old age they often become morose and capricious. Most\r\napes construct huts, or, at least, roofs, as a protection from the\r\nweather, and sleep in a kind of bed.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity is alone common to them and man, and this is the habit\r\nof lying upon the back in sleep. In battle they defend themselves with\r\ntheir fists and long sticks; and, under otherwise like circumstances,\r\nthey manifest like passions and emotions with man: as joy and sorrow,\r\npain and envy, revenge and sympathy. In death, especially, the ape\r\nface assumes a peculiarly human-like and spiritual expression, and the\r\nsufferer is the object of as genuine compassion as exists in the case\r\nof man. It is also well known that apes bury their dead, laying the\r\nbody in a secluded spot, and covering it with leaves. Regarding the\r\ndomestic life of the ape, Darwin says, in his \"Descent of Man\" (vol.\r\n1, p. 39):\r\n\r\n\"We see maternal affection manifested in the most trifling details.\r\nThus Rengger observed an American monkey (a Cebus) carefully driving\r\naway the flies which plagued her infant; and Duvancel saw a Hylobates\r\nwashing the faces of her young ones in a stream. So intense is\r\nthe grief of female monkeys for the loss of their young, that it\r\ninvariably caused the death of certain kinds kept under confinement\r\nby Brehm in North Africa. Orphan monkeys are always adopted, and\r\ncarefully guarded by other monkeys, both males and females. One female\r\nbaboon had so capacious a heart, that she not only adopted young\r\nmonkeys of other species but stole young dogs and cats, which she\r\ncontinually carried about with her. Her kindness did not go so far,\r\nhowever, as to share her food with her adopted offspring; at which\r\nBrehm was surprised, as his monkeys divided everything quite\r\nfairly with their own young ones. An adopted kitten scratched\r\nthe above-mentioned affectionate baboon, who certainly had a fine\r\nintellect, for she was much astonished at being scratched, and\r\nimmediately examined the kitten's feet, and without more ado bit off\r\nthe claws.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of characteristics possessed in common by man and the\r\nhigher apes is, indeed, very great, and includes not only physical\r\nand emotional but even intellectual qualities.--_From Schlickeysen's\r\n\"Fruit and Bread,\" translated by Dr. Holbrook._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersons who have sent numbers of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN to this\r\noffice, for the purpose of having them bound, will please call or send\r\nfor them immediately.\r\n\r\nSome of the volumes extend back to 1860, and as we need the room they\r\noccupy, we shall dispose of those not claimed within ten days from\r\ndate of this paper.\r\n\r\nMUNN & Co., 37 Park Row, New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISIONS OF THE COURTS.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT.--DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nSHAWL STRAP PATENT.--GEORGE CROUCH _vs._ WILLIAM ROEMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In equity.]\r\n\r\n  By Nixon, District Judge.\r\n\r\n  This is an action for an alleged infringement of complainant's\r\n  letters patent No. 82,606, dated September 29, 1868, and reissued\r\n  March 7, 1871, No. 4,289.\r\n\r\n  The subject-matter of the patent is in the reissue described to be\r\n  a strap \"to confine a shawl or similar article in a bundle,\" and\r\n  termed a shawl-strap. The schedule attached to and forming a part\r\n  of the said reissued patent states, that before the complainant's\r\n  invention \"straps had been used to confine a shawl or similar\r\n  article in a bundle, and a leather cross-piece with loops at the\r\n  ends, had extended from one strap to the other; and above and\r\n  attached to this leather cross-piece was a handle. This leather\r\n  cross-piece or connecting strap is liable to bend and allow the\r\n  straps to be drawn toward each other by the handle in sustaining\r\n  the weight. Hence the bundle is not kept in a proper shape and the\r\n  handle is inconvenient to grasp.\"\r\n\r\n  The invention is then stated to consist \"of a rigid cross-bar\r\n  beneath the handle, combined with suspending straps, that are to\r\n  be passed around the shawl or bundle, such straps passing through\r\n  loops at the ends of the handle.\"\r\n\r\n  No question can be made but that the shawl straps manufactured\r\n  and sold by the defendant are an infringement of the complainant's\r\n  reissue. They consist of a metallic cross-bar, with slots at the\r\n  ends for the reception of the straps, and which also connect the\r\n  ends of the handle.\r\n\r\n  Several defences are set up in the answer, but the only one\r\n  necessary to consider is the first, to wit: The want of novelty\r\n  and prior public use.\r\n\r\n  I had occasion, heretofore, to inquire into the validity of\r\n  the complainant's patent, in a controversy between the same\r\n  complainant, and Speer _et al._, reported in VI. Off. Gaz. 1874,\r\n  in which, as in this case, the principal defence turned upon\r\n  the novelty of the invention. A prior public use was alleged and\r\n  attempted to be proved. I there said and now repeat \"that the\r\n  patent is _prima facie_ evidence that the patentee was the\r\n  original and first inventor, and that any one who controverts this\r\n  assumes the burden of proof and undertakes to show affirmatively\r\n  that there was a prior knowledge and use of the alleged invention\r\n  under such circumstances, as to give to the public the right of\r\n  its continued use against the patentee.\"\r\n\r\n  The defence in this case has brought out many facts in regard to\r\n  the public use of the rigid cross-bar in shawl straps anterior to\r\n  the date of the complainant's patent, which were not developed in\r\n  the former suit. There is no evidence which in my judgment affects\r\n  the honesty of the complainant's claim, or which creates any\r\n  doubt that he really believed himself to be the original and first\r\n  inventor, but nevertheless I am constrained to the conclusion,\r\n  after a most careful examination of the whole testimony, that the\r\n  proofs show with reasonable certainty that he has been anticipated\r\n  in the invention and that his patent is void, in consequence of\r\n  the prior knowledge and public use, and the bill must be therefore\r\n  dismissed with costs.\r\n\r\n  [_E.

He asserts that \"all\r\n  our railways are uneconomically located,\" and \"in many cases these\r\n  errors are shockingly evident.\" If these statements are true, he\r\n  is right in stating that \"there is something almost pitiful in\r\n  the waste of human labor enforced by such costly blundering.\" He\r\n  considers that other countries have made lamentable blunders in\r\n  locating their railroads, so that the suffering stockholders of\r\n  American lines may take comfort from the thought that others are\r\n  or may be as badly off.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT AND BREAD.

The\r\n  subject is most carefully and systematically treated, and although\r\n  the conclusions at which the author arrives are greatly at\r\n  variance with modern belief and practice, the book is nevertheless\r\n  entitled to proper and respectful consideration. Illustrations are\r\n  given of the teeth and stomachs of various animals, and these are\r\n  compared with the similar organs existing in man, so exhibiting\r\n  in a clear and satisfactory manner the perfect adaptedness of the\r\n  latter to a purely vegetable regimen, which is certainly something\r\n  more than merely accidental. Altogether the book is well worthy\r\n  of perusal by others than those more immediately interested in the\r\n  question of diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORETICAL NAVAL ARCHITECTURE: a Treatise on the Calculations\r\ninvolved in Naval Design.

Numerous formulae and rules\r\n  clearly stated will enable the former to perform without much\r\n  difficulty the ordinary routine of the draughting office, while\r\n  ample opportunity is afforded the latter to trace back the\r\n  processes from which these rules have gone forth. The book is\r\n  divided into six parts. Part I. embraces the calculations relating\r\n  to the forms and dimensions of ships. II. those relating to the\r\n  weights and centers of gravity of ships. Part III. refers to the\r\n  strength of ships. IV. and V. to their propulsion by sails and by\r\n  steam engines; while Part VI. treats of the calculations relating\r\n  to steering.

Price $1.25.\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa.: Henry Carey Baird & Co.\r\n\r\n  This work will prove of great value to all in whom the curious\r\n  mechanism of clocks and watches has excited more than a passing\r\n  interest. None but skilled followers of the art have been allowed\r\n  to contribute to its pages, so that the practical worth of the\r\n  information given can be fully relied upon. A concise history of\r\n  timekeepers is followed by a clear and exhaustive description of\r\n  the English lever watch, which in turn is followed by articles\r\n  on cleaning, putting together, and the conditions necessary to\r\n  produce a good English watch. American watches deservedly engage\r\n  considerable attention. Papers on repairing watches, cleaning and\r\n  repairing clocks, and a short description of the necessary tools\r\n  complete the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT PROGRESS IN SANITARY SCIENCE. By A. R. Leeds.

Church, Walworth, Wis.--This is a hay elevator and carrier\r\nof simple and effective construction; and it consists essentially of a\r\ntraveling carriage locking, by a tilting catch, on a fixed stop block\r\nof the track, from which it is released by the action of the bail\r\nof the sheave frame of the hay fork on a pivoted grappling hook, the\r\nsheave being held in suspended position by the joint action of a fixed\r\nhook, of the pivoted hook, and of the tilting catch. A track beam,\r\nwhich is suspended from the rafters of a barn or other building by\r\nmeans of eyebolts passing through the center of the track beam. A\r\ncarriage runs along the track beam by a pair of flanged wheels, at\r\neach end of which the wheels of one pair are set at such distance from\r\neach other that they clear readily the suspension bolts as they pass\r\nalong the same. A hoisting rope is attached, in the customary manner,\r\nto a fixed point at one end of carriage, and passed then through the\r\nsheave frame of the hay fork, and over a pulley of the carriage, and\r\nthrough a sheave at the end of track beam, and down to the ground,\r\nwhere a horse is hitched to its free end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CORN HARVESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBennett Osgood, Lenox, Iowa.--This invention is an improved machine\r\nfor cutting up the corn, removing the ears from the stalks, and\r\ncutting the stalks into pieces, and which may be adjusted to cut up\r\nthe corn and shock it. As the stalks are carried back by chains, pins\r\nor hooks on bars tear open the husks of the ears; and the bars, in\r\nconnection with rollers, break the ears from the stalks. The ears,\r\nwhen broken off, drop through an opening in the platform into an\r\nelevator, up which they are carried, and are discharged into a wagon\r\ndrawn at the side of the machine. The box of the elevator is supported\r\nfrom the frame of the machine, and its carrier is driven from a shaft\r\nby an endless band. The stalks are carried back by endless chains, and\r\nallowed to drop from the rear end of the platform upon the brackets\r\nattached to the rear bar of the frame. As they fall upon the brackets\r\nthey are cut into three pieces by two knives, which work in slots in\r\nthe brackets, and to the upper part of which are pivoted the upper\r\nends of two bars. The lower ends of these bars are pivoted to a crank\r\nformed upon the shaft, which revolves in bearings attached to the rear\r\nbar of the frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SULKY HARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge M. Furman, Laclede, Mo.--This is an improved riding harrow,\r\nso constructed that it may be readily raised from the ground, by the\r\ndriver from his seat, to clear it of rubbish, to pass obstructions,\r\nand to pass from place to place, to cut up the ground and cover the\r\nseed thoroughly, and be used for cultivating small grain and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nHans Iver Lund, Charlotte, Iowa.--The object of this invention is to\r\nfurnish an iron harrow which shall be light, strong, and durable,\r\nof less draft than an ordinary harrow, of less size, inexpensive\r\nin manufacture, and effective in operation, breaking up the lumps\r\nthoroughly, and stirring up the soil evenly. The harrow is designed\r\nto be made in three sections, all exactly alike, one, two, or three of\r\nwhich may be used at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COMBINED COTTON SCRAPER AND CULTIVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalachiah Roby, Kosciusko, Miss.--This machine is so constructed as to\r\nbar off and dirt or cultivate cotton plants at one operation; and the\r\ninvention relates to the construction and arrangement of a center or\r\nmain beam, to the forward end of which the draft is attached. To the\r\nbeam, a little in the rear of its forward end, is attached the middle\r\npart of a crossbar, in which are formed a number of holes to receive\r\nthe hooks or clevises by which the forward ends of side beams are\r\nsecured to said crossbar. To the rear end of the main beam is attached\r\nthe middle part of a crossbar, to which the rear ends of the side\r\nbeams are secured by a bow and yoke passed around them diagonally, and\r\nwhich are tightened, when adjusted in place, by nuts screwed upon the\r\nends of the bows. Bands are passed around said beams and diagonally\r\naround said standards, and tightened in place by wedges or other\r\nsuitable means, so that the scrapers can be readily adjusted to\r\nwork deeper or shallower in the ground, and easily detached when not\r\nrequired for use. Cultivating plows or dirters have standards which\r\nare attached to the side beams, the plows and standards of the inner\r\nside beams being placed in advance of those attached to the outer side\r\nbeams. When the machine is to be used as a cultivator, the scrapers\r\nare detached, and may be replaced by cultivating plows.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CULTIVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAustin S. McDermott, Prairie Creek (Melleray P. O.), Iowa.--The object\r\nof this invention is to furnish a cultivator which shall be readily\r\nadjusted as the character of the work to be done may require, and\r\neasily guided and controlled. The tongue of the machine is made in\r\nV shape, and its rear end is attached to the axle. The arms of the\r\ntongue are connected by a crossbar, to which the doubletree is pivoted\r\nby a hammer bolt. To the ends of the axle are attached, or upon them\r\nare formed, crank axle arms, upon the journals of which the wheels\r\nrevolve. To the arms of the tongue, near the forward end of said\r\ntongue, are bolted the ends of the forward arms of the three-armed\r\nbar, the third arm of which projects to the rearward, and its rear end\r\nis bent into U form to receive a curved bar, which is pivoted to\r\nthe three-armed bar by a bolt that passes through the bend of the\r\nthree-armed bar and through the center of the curved bar. The ends of\r\nthe curved bar are secured to the forward ends of the beams by bolts,\r\ntwo to each end. To the rear ends of the beams are attached handles\r\nwhich may be strengthened by braces, and are designed for use in\r\nguiding the plows when the machine is used as a walking cultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CHICKEN COOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel M. Sullivan and Thomas A. Retallic, Montgomery City, Mo.--This\r\ninvention consists of a coop adjustable vertically on a standard,\r\nand provided with removable partitions and doors for convenience in\r\ncleansing. The frame of the coop is placed on a standard, at the top\r\nof which is placed a pulley. A cord is attached to the top of the coop\r\nframe, and runs over the pulley, and is attached to a counterweight.\r\nThe coop is divided by a central transverse partition into two\r\ncompartments, which are subdivided by transverse partitions composed\r\nof slats, and held in place by a dowel pin at the bottom and by a pin\r\nat the top. The vertical strips that hold the slats of the partitions\r\ntogether are grooved on each side to receive sliding partitions which\r\nare arranged on a central longitudinal line of the coop, and at\r\nright angles to the partitions. Grooves are also made in the ends and\r\ncentral partition of the coop to receive these sliding partitions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TEXTILE INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FULLING MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Hunter, North Adams, Mass., assignor to himself and James E.\r\nHunter, of same place.--The object of this invention is to improve\r\nthe construction of fulling mills in such a way that there can be no\r\npossibility of injuring the cloth while passing through the rollers,\r\nand in such a way as to give the operator full control over the\r\nfriction caused by the tongue or lever upon the goods, whether said\r\ngoods be heavy or light.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SHUTTLE-DRIVING MECHANISM FOR NARROW-WARE LOOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Willard, New York city.--This invention, relating to looms\r\nfor weaving narrow ware, consists in the arrangement of a spur wheel\r\ntraveling on a fixed rack, and actuating a movable rack attached to\r\nthe shuttle carrier. Motion is given to the spur wheel by a cam on the\r\nmain shaft of the machine, which acts through a slotted lever and a\r\nconnecting rod. The object is to provide mechanism for throwing the\r\nshuttle in such looms. In the loom the shuttlerace is divided at its\r\ncenter, leaving a space of sufficient width to admit of the passage\r\nand shedding of the warp. The shuttle slides in the race, and is of\r\nsuch length as to overlap the opening, so that it may pass smoothly\r\nfrom one section of the shuttlerace to the other. The shuttle is\r\npierced to receive the fingers of the shuttle carrier, which slides on\r\nthe bar. The latter is a piece of sheet metal, which is turned over at\r\nits upper edge to receive the bar, and is provided with guides for the\r\nfingers. The said fingers are capable of engaging with the holes in\r\nthe shuttle and project below the piece of sheet metal, and are bent\r\nat right angles, and provided with grooved friction rollers, which\r\nengage with a cam slot of such form that it will draw the fingers, one\r\nat a time, downward out of the shuttle, and retain them below the\r\nwarp during the passage of the portion of the shuttle with which they\r\nengage, through the threads of the warp, and replace them after that\r\npart of the shuttle passes the warp.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED LOOM TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian H. Schlaf, Rockville, Conn.--This is an improved device for\r\nstretching the cloth while being woven. It is so constructed as to\r\nadjust itself as the cloth is being woven and carried forward to the\r\ncloth beam.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW WOODWORKING AND HOUSE AND CARRIAGE BUILDING INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED THILL COUPLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nJosiah Kitzmiller, Keedysville, Md.--This is an improvement upon that\r\nform of thill coupling in which a pivoted cap is employed to slide\r\nover the end of the bolt or pin which secures the eye of the thill\r\niron to the lugs or ears of the axle clip, the said cap serving to\r\nprevent the said pin from becoming accidentally displaced without\r\nthe use of a screw nut or other securing device. It consists in the\r\nconstruction and arrangements of a spring catch for holding\r\nsaid pivoted cap down to its place against any tendency to rise\r\naccidentally, the said spring catch being located in a transverse\r\ngroove or recess in the cap and between the cap and the adjacent lug\r\nand being provided with a beveled head and square shoulder, which\r\nengages with the under side of the lug to hold the cap down. The merit\r\nof this arrangement is that the catch is concealed from sight by the\r\ncomplete inclosure of the spring and the position of the beveled head\r\nbeneath the coupling, and hence the exterior of the coupling\r\npresents a plain, smooth, and neat appearance, free from catches\r\nor projections, which would be liable to hook into the clothing in\r\ngetting into or out of the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED VEHICLE SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFredrick W. Faber, Columbus, Texas.--This invention consists in\r\ncombining an auxiliary spring with a spring suspended from goosenecks\r\nattached to the axle, the said auxiliary spring being attached to the\r\naxle, and provided with yokes for embracing the suspended spring, the\r\nobject being to provide a device for steadying the main spring and\r\npreventing lateral motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED TIRE HEATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip W. Cassil, New Athens, O.--To the top of the furnace or firebox\r\nis secured the ring heating chamber, which consists of the ring plate\r\nhaving a ring flange or rim formed around its outer edge. To the ring\r\nplate are attached the outer ends of a number of arms, the inner ends\r\nof which meet in the center of the ring plate, and have a journal\r\nattached to them. The journal may be hollow or solid, and upon it is\r\nplaced a hub to which are attached a number of radial arms, to the\r\nouter ends of which is attached a rim. The rim fits against the\r\ninner part of the ring plate, and forms the inner wall of the heating\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED CHIMNEY COWL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew F. Barry and Ira G. Lane, New York city.--This invention is a\r\nchimney cowl or ventilator which will deflect the natural current of\r\nair, so that a draft is continually maintained. To the upper end of\r\na sheet metal chimney top is attached a strip of metal, bent into a\r\nspiral form, and having spaces between the successive convolutions of\r\nthe spiral. The spirals overlap each other, and increase in diameter\r\ntowards the top. The coils are connected at intervals by stays, and\r\nthe end of the upper and outer coil is tapped on to the one that\r\nprecedes it, and is trimmed off horizontally, and upon it is placed an\r\nornamental border. The wind, striking this top from any direction,\r\nis deflected so as to cause a draft. The device is claimed to be\r\nornamental in appearance, is cheaply and easily made, and does not\r\nobstruct the chimney.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED WAGON AXLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilbur F. Buckelew, Shreveport, La.--The object of this invention is\r\nto strengthen the wooden axles of wagons, and to fasten the skeins\r\nso that they will not become loose. A wooden axle is grooved\r\nlongitudinally upon its under side throughout its entire length, to\r\nreceive a rod, which is reduced in size at its ends, and threaded to\r\nreceive the nuts. This rod is bent so as to conform to the tapering\r\nportion of the axle upon which the skein is placed. The skeins, having\r\ncountersunk outer ends, are placed on the ends of the axle, and nuts\r\nhaving a beveled face corresponding to the countersunk ends of the\r\nskeins, are placed on the ends of the rod, and clamp the skeins\r\nsecurely on the axle. By giving the nut this peculiar form, it\r\ncontains more threads than it otherwise would, and is in consequence\r\nstronger. The rod not only serves to retain the skeins securely in\r\ntheir places, but it also acts as a stay or truss rod for the axle,\r\ngreatly strengthening it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED WAGON BRAKE LEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob P. Outson, Racine, Wis.--This invention consists of a curved\r\nratchet bar and two levers working on the same pivot, one carrying a\r\nspring pawl, that engages with the curved ratchet bar, and the other\r\ncarrying a stud for throwing the pawl out of the notches of the\r\nratchet bar. When the brake is to be applied to the wheels of the\r\nwagon, one lever is thrown forward, carrying with it the other lever;\r\nand the pawl, by engaging the notches of the bar, holds the lever\r\nat any desired point. When it is desired to release the brake first\r\nnamed, the lever is drawn back, moving first the length of the slot,\r\nthe stud striking the pawl and throwing it out of engagement with\r\nthe ratchet bar, when the lever may be carried back to any required\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW HOUSEHOLD INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuna Drew, Irving, Wis.--This is an improved baking attachment to\r\nheating stoves of all kinds, so that the heat of the same may be\r\nutilized for baking, warming, raising bread, and other purposes. It\r\nconsists of a baker supported on adjustable legs, and secured to\r\na round, oval, or square heating stove by suitable top and bottom\r\nslides. A warmer is arranged below the baker. The front of the baker\r\nis detachable, to admit its use for baking or warming purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FIRE KINDLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn G. Distler, Brooklyn (Greenpoint P. O.), N. Y.--This invention is\r\nan improved fire kindler, simple in construction, convenient in use,\r\nand effective in operation, burning freely, and lasting long enough\r\nto fully kindle the fire. It is formed of corncobs, steamed, having\r\na number of transverse holes formed through them, dried, dipped in\r\nmelted white resin, and wrapped in paper. The corncobs are steamed to\r\nprevent them from breaking while being bored. The cobs, while still\r\nmoist with the steam, have a number of transverse holes bored in them\r\nwith a rapidly revolving bit, and are then thoroughly dried. When dry\r\nthe cobs are dipped in melted white resin, and before they are fully\r\ncold they are wrapped in ordinary paper, which adheres to them,\r\nprevents any odor from passing off into the room and prevents them\r\nfrom soiling the hands while being handled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED MATCH SAFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn A. Field, Racine, Wis.--This is a match safe, the back, top, and\r\nfront of which are made from a single piece of tin, and to which a\r\nlighter of wire cloth is attached, which is placed over a picture, to\r\ngive the match safe an ornamental appearance. It is so arranged that\r\nthe matches are delivered singly to a pair of hooks, from which they\r\nmay be readily taken by the fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED NURSERY CHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther I. Adams, East Templeton, Mass.--This chair may be readily\r\nconverted into a high or low chair, and in which an attached toy box\r\nretains the toys when the chair is in either position. The armed low\r\nchair has curved legs. Between the rear legs a shaft is journaled,\r\nupon which two wheels are placed. The support for the low parts\r\nwhen it is used as a high chair consists of two similar sides, each\r\ncomposed of two curved strips, which are held together partly by\r\ncrossbars and partly by triangular metallic pieces that are attached\r\nto their upper ends and pivoted to the center of the crossbars that\r\nconnect the legs. A shaft, having upon it wheels, is journaled in the\r\ncurved strips at the back of the chair near the lower ends. The toy\r\nbox consists of a tray that is concaved at its upper edge and is made\r\nconvex at its lower end, and is provided with a cover that extends\r\nover a portion of it, and forms a receptacle for toys when the box is\r\nin a vertical position.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FRUIT JAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatherine Hastings, Oswego, N. Y.--This is an improved attachment for\r\nfruit jars, to enable them to be conveniently handled when filled with\r\nhot fruit, and at other times. It does not interfere with standing the\r\nfull fruit jars upon their tops, if desired, and enables the jars to\r\nbe used for holding and carrying various articles. There is a metallic\r\nscrew band, by which the cover is secured upon the mouth of jar. To\r\nthe opposite sides of the band are soldered lugs to which are pivoted\r\nthe ends of a wire bail.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED VENTILATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles E. Darling, Lewiston, Me., assignor of two thirds his right\r\nto Henry Free and John E. Lydston, of same place.--This ventilator for\r\nwindows, doors, etc., works in noiseless manner, and is watertight. It\r\nconsists of radially recessed face disks, clamped to the glass frame,\r\nand having an intermediate pivoted disk with corresponding recesses\r\nthat are set by a crank lever and cords into open or closed piston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BAKING PAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles I. Kagey and Fred W. Stoneburner, Arcola, Ill.--The body of\r\nthis roaster is made of sheet iron, and is rectangular in form. To one\r\nend of the body a cap is secured, and to the other end a rectangular\r\ncast iron frame is fitted, to which a cast iron door is hinged. At the\r\ntop of the roaster, at or near its center, an aperture is made, which\r\nis closed by a tapering projection that extends downward from a plate\r\nthat is hinged to the top of the roaster. Rings are attached to the\r\ntop of the roaster near each end for convenience in handling. The\r\napparatus, when in use, is placed upon a stove or in an oven.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED STOVEPIPE SHELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn W. Jackson, Sharpsville, Pa.--A wire of the requisite strength is\r\nbent into the shape required to form the horizontal support. To this\r\nthe shelf is attached, and also the bracket, which rests against the\r\npipe for supporting the same.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MECHANICAL AND ENGINEERING INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED WATER WHEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Mallery, Dryden, N. Y.--This invention relates to downward\r\ndischarge turbine water wheels; and it consists in the employment, in\r\ncombination with a stationary chute case and an independent adjustable\r\nframe, of a series of gates, which are pivoted to this frame and\r\nadjustable to the periphery of said case. The bucket wheel is formed\r\nof curved and inclined buckets arranged around a hub, and applied to a\r\ncap ring and a skirting. This wheel is keyed on a driving shaft,\r\nstepped on a bridge, and passed up through a tubular sleeve, which is\r\ncast on the top of a cylindrical chute or guide case. This case is\r\nrigidly secured to the base or bed frame, and constructed with oblique\r\nissues, which direct the currents of inflowing water against the\r\nbuckets of the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED VALVE MOTION FOR STEAM ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Haering, New York city.--This is an improved device for\r\noperating the slide valve of a steam engine from the piston rod of\r\nsaid engine, in such a way that the valve will be moved slightly to\r\npartially uncover the inlet and exhaust ports as the piston completes\r\nits stroke, and its motion will be continued in the same direction as\r\nthe piston begins to move upon the return stroke, until the ports are\r\nfully opened, and will then stand still, with the ports fully open,\r\nuntil the piston has nearly completed its return stroke. It consists\r\nin the combination of a three-armed bar, two levers, connecting bar,\r\nand connecting lever, with the piston rod and the valve stem of\r\na steam engine; and in the combination of a lockbar, spring, two\r\ncylinders, and pin, with the two levers and the three-armed bar.\r\nAs the piston approaches the end of its stroke, the upper end of an\r\nupright arm of a bar strikes the concaved side of the upper part of\r\none of the levers operating it, and moving the slide valve to close\r\nthe ports and admit steam in front of the piston. As the piston begins\r\nits return stroke the inclined upper surface of one of the side arms\r\nof the three-armed bar comes in contact with the lower end of the said\r\nlever, and continues its motion in the same direction, fully opening\r\nthe said inlet port, which remains fully open until the piston has\r\nagain nearly completed its stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED REVERSIBLE ECCENTRIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge G. Lafayette and Pitt W. Strong, Brockville, Ontario,\r\nCanada.--This is an improved device to act as a substitute for the\r\nlink motion on a reversible engine, or for adjusting the stroke of\r\na boiler-feed pump, while in motion, so as to regulate the amount of\r\nfeed water supplied to the boiler, without the use of an overflow pipe\r\nand cock, and keeping thereby the pump constantly in motion, which\r\nwill save the annoyance frequently experienced in pumps by their\r\nrefusing to prime after having been stopped for a short time. It may\r\nbe further used to control the speed of all kinds of engines, whether\r\nwith plain slide valve or with a cut-off valve working on top of the\r\nother by connecting directly to the device a suitable governor, so\r\nas to automatically shorten and lengthen the stroke of the valve, and\r\ngive a uniform motion to the engine under different loads.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED EXPANDING REAMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Blair, San Francisco, Cal.--In this improved tool there is\r\na clamping bolt by which the cutters are clamped fast after being\r\nadjusted. The cutters are arranged to slide directly across the stock\r\nin dovetail grooves, and are slotted to slide along the clamping bolt\r\nand washers, by which they are clamped fast after they are adjusted\r\nto the position required by a toothed pinion and racks. The pinion is\r\narranged in the stock between the cutters, and the shaft extends out\r\nof the end of the stock, with a nick in the end for a screwdriver to\r\nturn it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\nIMPROVED TORTOISE-SHELL HANDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristian W.

There is a receptacle for containing the liquid to be diffused\r\nor atomized. A pipe passes through a stopper placed in the neck of the\r\nsaid receptacle, and extends nearly to the bottom of the same, and its\r\nupper end is provided with a stopcock and nozzle. A nozzle is arranged\r\nat right angles to the first-mentioned nozzle, and is attached to a\r\nbrace that is secured to the pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED OIL CAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Graves, New York city, assignor to himself and James L. Miller,\r\nWestfield, N. J.--This is an improved case for packing oil cans for\r\ntransportation, the case furnishing the additional facility that the\r\ncan may be readily inserted into the same and tilted for use. The\r\ninvention consists of a wooden projecting case with side slots, in\r\nwhich trunnions of the can are guided and supported for swinging the\r\ncan on pivot hooks, which serve also for the purpose of locking the\r\nlid to the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HARNESS TUGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Hauff, Ashland, O.--The body of the carrier is made in the\r\nform of a ring with outwardly projecting flanges around its edges. The\r\nstrap is passed around the ring in the groove formed by its flanges,\r\nand its inner end is sewed to its body at the side. Small wedge-shaped\r\nblocks of leather are inserted in the angle between the parts of the\r\nstrap where they meet and the ring, which angular blocks are covered\r\nby angular projection of the flanges of the ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COMPOSITION FOR CASTING ORNAMENTAL FIGURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust Kiesele, New York city.--This consists in a composition\r\nformed by the admixture of dry pulverized sugar, melted paraffin, and\r\nstearine.

So large is the number of our\r\ncorrespondents, so wide the range of their inquiries, so desirous are\r\nwe to meet their wants and supply correct information, that we are\r\nobliged to employ the constant assistance of a considerable staff of\r\nexperienced writers, who have the requisite knowledge or access to\r\nthe latest and best sources of information. For example, questions\r\nrelating to steam engines, boilers, boats, locomotives, railways,\r\netc., are considered and answered by a professional engineer of\r\ndistinguished ability and extensive practical experience. Inquiries\r\nrelating to electricity are answered by one of the most able and\r\nprominent practical electricians in this country. Astronomical queries\r\nby a practical astronomer. Chemical inquiries by one of our most\r\neminent and experienced professors of chemistry; and so on through\r\nall the various departments. In this way we are enabled to answer the\r\nthousands of questions and furnish the large mass of information which\r\nthese correspondence columns present. The large number of questions\r\nsent--they pour in upon us from all parts of the world--renders it\r\nimpossible for us to publish all. The editor selects from the mass\r\nthose that he thinks most likely to be of general interest to the\r\nreaders of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. These, with the replies, are\r\nprinted; the remainder go into the waste basket. Many of the rejected\r\nquestions are of a primitive or personal nature, which should be\r\nanswered by mail; in fact, hundreds of correspondents desire a special\r\nreply by post, but very few of them are thoughtful enough to inclose\r\nso much as a postage stamp. We could in many cases send a brief reply\r\nby mail if the writer were to inclose a small fee, a dollar or more,\r\naccording to the nature or importance of the case. When we cannot\r\nfurnish the information, the money is promptly returned to the sender.\r\n\r\nJ. P. D. will find directions for colored whitewash on pp. 235, 236,\r\nvol. 36.--A.

N., of Christ Church, New Zealand, asks: Is the stearin from\r\nwhich the olein has been extracted by Dr. Mott's process fit to be\r\nmade at once into good stearin candles, without any further treatment?\r\nA. Yes.\r\n\r\n(2) B. B. says: I wish to express the strongest coloring matter from\r\ncertain herbs, sage leaves, for instance. How can it best be done\r\ncheaply and quickly? Evaporation during several days, after boiling\r\nand simmering, has the effect; but it is inconveniently slow. The\r\ncolor produced is a medium brown. A. Dry the leaves, etc., thoroughly,\r\nand grind to a fine powder. Digest this for several days in enough\r\nwarm water to thoroughly moisten it throughout. Then add enough wood\r\nnaphtha to make a stiff paste, and after standing an hour transfer to\r\na fine linen bag and express the thick liquid in a screw press. 2. Is\r\nthere anything that will set the color? A. Try a strong hot solution\r\nof alum.\r\n\r\n(3) H. K. F. M. says: I have a box made of Bohemian crystal. The\r\ncover, which was held to the box by a brass frame, has come apart\r\nfrom its frame. It seemed to have been cemented by a hard substance\r\nresembling plaster of Paris. How can I make it? A. Boil 3 parts\r\npowdered rosin for sometime with 1 part of caustic soda and 5 parts of\r\nwater; then stir into the soap formed one half its weight of plaster\r\nof Paris, and use immediately.\r\n\r\n(4) F. N. Y. asks: Would a canvas bag, coated with a varnish made of\r\nindia rubber dissolved in naphtha, be suitable to hold oxygen gas? A.\r\nYes; but bags made of double pieces of cloth, cemented together with\r\nthe varnish, are better.\r\n\r\n(5) J. A. B. asks: Is there any difference between electricity\r\nand magnetism? A. Electricity and magnetism are supposed to be\r\nmanifestations of the same force whose actions are produced at\r\nright angles to each other; the action which occurs in the line of\r\npolarization being called electricity, and the one at right angles to\r\nthis line, magnetism. There is an important difference between\r\nthem, however, as electricity is essentially a dynamic force, while\r\nmagnetism is purely static.\r\n\r\n1. Is not the idea of the world moving around the sun in an elliptic\r\nform absurd? A. No. 2. My idea is that the north star is the center\r\nof the universe, or in fact is the magnet that all the suns or fixed\r\nstars move around, and that the attraction of the pole of the earth,\r\nalthough it moves around the sun, is the cause of the change of\r\nseasons, or, in other words, the angle of light. A. There is nothing\r\nwhatever to support the idea. But a supposed center of the universe\r\nhas really been designated by some astronomers.\r\n\r\n(6) P. S. asks: How much copper wire does it require to construct an\r\nelectro-magnet that will uphold 100 lbs., and what size of wire should\r\nbe used? A. Probably 500 or 600 feet of No. 14 copper wire would be\r\nsufficient with 3 or 4 very large size Grove cells and cores about 6\r\ninches long and 1 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n(7) H. S. B. says: Water falls about 16 feet per second. My overshot\r\nwater wheel moves about 4 feet per second. Do I in that way lose that\r\npercentage of the actual power of the water? A. Not necessarily.\r\n\r\n(8) C. N. B. asks: Can a steam engine be worked with compressed air\r\nthe same as with steam? A. Generally speaking, it can; but not in\r\nevery respect.\r\n\r\n(9) J. Y. says: If all the measures of length, surface, and capacity\r\nin the world, and all the weights were lost, by what means could new\r\nones be made corresponding exactly with those we now have? A. It would\r\nbe impossible, as all the measures in use refer to certain arbitrary\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n(10) R. B. G. asks: If a horse be pulling at the end of a lever and\r\ntraveling 3 miles an hour, how many lbs. pressure against his collar\r\nmust he exert, to raise 33,000 lbs. 1 foot per minute? A. The force\r\nexerted by the animal will depend upon the length of the lever, which\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\n(11) C. H. McK. asks: Would a pump so constructed as to create an\r\nincessant suction draw water an indefinite distance, or how far would\r\nit draw it? A. Such a pump would raise water no higher than any other\r\nthat was equally tight.\r\n\r\n(12) J. W. says: I wish to get some boilers made about 12 inches\r\nin diameter and 13 inches deep. I want them to stand a pressure\r\ncorresponding to 400 deg. Fah deg.. Do you think it would be safe to have them\r\nmade of cast iron? A. We think it will be better to use wrought iron.\r\nMake the shell about 7/16 of an inch thick.\r\n\r\n(13) J. R. S. says, in reply to E. W. P., who says that he has\r\nan artesian well which does not flow; but from which he pumps by\r\ninserting a pipe inside the well tubing, and asks: \"If we attach the\r\npump to the well tubing directly, allowing no air to enter the tube,\r\nwould it not be like trying to pump water from an airtight barrel?\" If\r\nsuch were the case, the drive well would be a miserable failure; for\r\nin all drive wells the pump is attached directly to the tube. I would\r\nadvise E. W. P. to attach his pump to the well tube direct, and he\r\nwill gain three times the amount of water that he now gets. By having\r\nhis pump attached to the well tube directly, the working of the pump\r\ncreates a vacuum, and the atmospheric pressure on the earth's surface\r\nviolently forces the liquid to fill the vacuum thus formed, thereby\r\ngiving a much greater amount of water than can be otherwise obtained.\r\nIt is a well established fact that more water can be obtained by the\r\ndrive well than by any other. A. In our answer to E. W. P., it will\r\nbe evident, we think, to most of our readers, that we only referred to\r\nthe case in which the well had no connection with the atmosphere, when\r\nthe pipe was tightly fitted. It appears, however, that it might have\r\nbeen better to have stated this more definitely, and we gladly\r\nembrace the opportunity afforded by the interesting letters of\r\nour correspondents. We would be glad to receive from J. R. S. some\r\nexperimental data in proof of his assertion as to the great gain from\r\na tight connection. This also answers J. T. G. and W. H. F.\r\n\r\n(14) H. H. S. says: 1. Given, a boat with a 35 feet keel, of 6 feet\r\nbeam, with fine lines; also a two-cylinder engine, each cylinder 4 x\r\n5 inches; and a wheel 28 inches in diameter and of 31/2 feet pitch. Will\r\nan upright boiler, with 135 square feet heating surface, and 4 square\r\nfeet grate surface, be sufficient to run the engine at 250 or 300\r\nrevolutions per minute with 100 lbs. steam? A. With good coal and\r\na forced draft, the boiler may be large enough. 2. What will be the\r\nprobable speed of boat? A. In smooth water, 7 to 8 miles an hour.\r\n\r\n(15) F. A. asks: What would be a safe outside pressure for a cylinder\r\nof wrought iron, 1/2 inch thick and 4 feet in diameter, and 8 feet long?\r\nA. According to tables given in Wilson's \"Treatise on Steam Boilers,\"\r\nthe working pressure for such a tube would be about 65 lbs. per square\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n(16) F. M. M. asks: 1. How large must an engine be to run a boat 121/2\r\nfeet wide, 75 feet long, drawing 4 feet of water, at the rate of 30\r\nmiles per hour, on a river or bay where the surface is smooth? A. We\r\nhave some doubts as to whether these conditions could be fulfilled. 2.\r\nDo steamboats on the ocean use salt water in their boilers for\r\nsteam, or do they carry fresh water? A. They ordinarily have surface\r\ncondensers, so that the water of condensation is returned to the\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\n(17) E. S. N. says: Please give your ideas as to how much water an\r\nengine 18 inches in diameter by 22 inches stroke, running at 145\r\nrevolutions per minute, at 80 lbs. steam, cutting off at about 18\r\ninches, will require. We furnished an injector for one of the above\r\ndimensions, capable of throwing 900 gallons per hour. It was found\r\nto be insufficient, and I went to the mill to discover the cause, if\r\npossible. The manufacturers of the injector thought it ought to be\r\nlarge enough, and so did we. I found everything set up properly, and\r\nthe piston and valve were evidently in good order. I finally measured\r\nthe capacity of the tank which supplied the injector, and found\r\nthat it drew 960 gallons per hour. A. We do not think the data are\r\nsufficient for an accurate calculation. It is possible, however, that\r\nsome of our readers have made experiments on similar engines, and can\r\ngive some useful information.\r\n\r\n(18) T. W. asks: What size of breast water wheel, with a fall of 2\r\nfeet water, would it require to produce the same power as an overshot\r\nwheel of 4 feet diameter, 18 inches face, with a fall of 5 feet water?\r\nA. If the breast wheel gave the same efficiency as the other, it would\r\nrequire a face about 21/2 times as wide.\r\n\r\n(19) A. K. says: A. asserts that if a small and a large boiler be set\r\nside by side and connected with the top gauge cock of the two boilers,\r\nlevel, when they are first filled with water, and then steam is\r\nraised, that the water will not remain the same, that the pressure\r\nwill be greater in the larger boiler, and consequently will force the\r\nwater into the smaller one. B. says that the water will always remain\r\nthe same as long as the boilers are connected; that the pressure on\r\nthe water will be the same in both boilers, and therefore the water\r\nwill always assume the same level in each. Which is right? A. The\r\npressures sometimes vary in two boilers connected in this way; and\r\nthey should be set in such a way that the water cannot be forced from\r\none into the other under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n(20) J. T. G. says: I notice your reply to W. G. in regard to pounding\r\nof a steam pump, in which you recommend the use of a larger air\r\nvessel. I think that W. G. can remedy the difficulty by allowing a\r\nsmall quantity of air to enter the pump cylinder at each stroke,\r\nwhich can be done without sensibly diminishing the amount of water\r\ndelivered, provided the lift is not so high as to nearly equal the\r\ncapacity of the pump. That would keep the maximum quantity of air in\r\nthe air vessel, and I think that the air in the discharge pipe would\r\nhave the effect of converting a comparatively rigid column into an\r\nelastic one. W. G. can easily try the experiment by running with\r\nthe drain cocks at the end of his pump partially open; and if that\r\nremedies the difficulty, he might insert a small check valve opening\r\ninward to prevent the discharge of water during the out-stroke. If W.\r\nG. tries this, I wish that he would let us know the result through the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n(21) G. H. says: Please decide the following: A. claims that a team\r\nof horses can draw a greater load when hitched close to it than when\r\nhitched at a distance of 10 or 20 feet. B. claims that, everything\r\nelse being equal, distance makes no difference, and that the team\r\ncould pull as many lbs. at a distance of 20 feet as it could at ten or\r\nless. Which is right? A. We incline to B.'s opinion.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me the relative power of conducting electricity of\r\nthe principal metals. A. According to Matthiessen, the electrical\r\nconductivity of the principal metals, under similar conditions, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Silver             100.0\r\n  Copper              99.9\r\n  Gold                80.0\r\n  Aluminium           56.0\r\n  Sodium              37.4\r\n  Zinc                29.0\r\n  Cadmium             23.7\r\n  Potassium           20.8\r\n  Platinum            18.0\r\n  Iron                16.8\r\n  Tin                 13.1\r\n  Lead                 8.3\r\n  German silver        7.7\r\n  Antimony             4.6\r\n  Mercury              1.6\r\n  Bismuth              1.2\r\n\r\n(22) S. R. S. asks: How can lime, or rather phosphate of lime, be\r\nprecipitated from cod liver oil, which is perfectly clear and said to\r\ncontain 2 per cent. of the phosphate? A. This can only be done by\r\nfirst destroying the organic matter of the oil, and then examining the\r\nresidue for the phosphates with the usual reagents--magnesia solution,\r\nbarium chloride, nitrate of silver, ammonium molybdate, etc. With so\r\nsmall a percentage of the phosphates, it will be necessary for you to\r\nwork with concentrated solutions, and slowly. The oil may be oxidized\r\nby treating it on the waterbath with hot hydrochloric acid, with\r\nsome chlorate of potash, added in small quantities at a time. Then\r\nevaporate down nearly to dryness, and treat with a little strong\r\nnitric and a few drops of sulphuric acid. This will take some time if\r\nproperly done.\r\n\r\n(23) J. H. S. says, in answer to J. H. B.'s query as to a parrot\r\npulling out his feathers: Take a knife and scrape the inside edge of\r\nthe bill, and the feathers will slip from the bill without coming out.\r\nThis is done for feather-eating hens; no doubt it will answer for a\r\nparrot as well.\r\n\r\n(24) S. R. S. says: I have some dentists' pellet gold. I alloyed it\r\nwith brass and silver. I melted it several times, but it was so very\r\nbrittle that I could not work it. I then added a $21/2 gold coin, and\r\nfused, all together, but it was as brittle as before. I then fused it\r\nand dropped in lumps of pure saltpeter, but it is still as brittle\r\nas before. I fused the gold on a lump of charcoal with an alcohol\r\nblowpipe. Please tell me how to work it. A. You fail to state the\r\nproportions of your alloy. There may be an excess of zinc and copper,\r\nor the fusion may not have been complete. Place it, together with\r\nseveral small pieces of rosin and a little borax or carbonate of soda,\r\nin a small blacklead crucible, and heat to very bright redness over\r\na good fire. If this does not obviate the difficulty, fuse the alloy\r\nwith about three times its weight of nitrate of potassa (saltpeter),\r\nand treat the mass when cold with dilute sulphuric acid. Pour off the\r\nacid solution and fuse the alloy, together with any silver sulphate\r\nadhering to it and a little carbonate of soda. Any silver contained in\r\nthe acid solution may be recovered by adding a little salt or muriatic\r\nacid, and fusing the precipitated chloride of silver with carbonate of\r\nsoda.\r\n\r\n(25) N. S. asks: 1. Can water be decomposed into its constituents\r\n(oxygen and hydrogen) with any considerable rapidity, and in large\r\nquantities, by electricity? A. Yes; providing a large magneto-electric\r\nmachine be used. 2. What is the best and cheapest method of generating\r\nhydrogen in large quantities? A. The action of iron or zinc scraps\r\non diluted oil of vitriol is among the best. A considerable volume\r\nof pure hydrogen may also be obtained with facility by passing\r\nsuperheated steam through a large iron tube filled with scrap iron\r\nheated to bright redness.\r\n\r\n(26) G. S. D. W. asks: Is there any process by which an engraving can\r\nbe transferred either to stone or wood, where the printing ink can\r\nbe made to show up as black as in the original after the transfer has\r\nbeen made? A. We know of no satisfactory method whereby this may\r\nbe accomplished directly. By means of the chromate of gelatin\r\nphotographic process, such transfers may be made without great\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n(27) F. M. M. asks: 1. If a steamboat 100 feet long, of 5 feet beam\r\nand 4 feet draught, be provided with one set of common side paddle\r\nwheels, and power enough to run it at the rate of 10 knots per\r\nhour, would two sets of side wheels, with the power doubled and the\r\nrevolutions of the wheels doubled, double the speed of the boat? A.\r\nNo. 2. If we take the same boat, side wheels, and power, for running\r\n10 knots per hour, and arrange for the side wheels to feather their\r\npaddles, what effect would it have on the speed of the boat? A. You\r\nmight obtain from 10 to 15 per cent. more of the power of the engine in\r\nuseful effect.\r\n\r\n(28) W. J. T. asks: 1. What is the best dark color to paint a\r\nlaboratory, and what kind of paint must I use? A. One of the best for\r\nthis purpose is shellac in alcohol, colored to suit with Vandyke or\r\nSpanish brown, etc. 2. I wish to varnish my benches. What varnish\r\nwould you recommend? A. Shellac is commonly used, but copal gives good\r\nresults, also Brunswick black in oil.\r\n\r\nOf what should a waste water pipe be made, so as to resist acids? A.\r\nMake it of lead or block tin.\r\n\r\nCan you recommend an elementary work on electric batteries? A.\r\nSprague's \"Electricity: its Theory, Sources, and Applications,\" is one\r\nof the best.\r\n\r\n(29) T. P. H. asks: Can I take a wax impression off type and then\r\nelectrotype it with a battery? A. Yes. This is the common method of\r\nmaking electrotypes for printing from.\r\n\r\n(30) C. M. asks: What are the locations of the various branch mints of\r\nthe United States? A. A recent authority gives them as Philadelphia,\r\nPa., San Francisco, Cal., Carson City, Nev., and Denver, Col. Assay\r\noffices are situated at New York city, Charlotte, N. C., and Boise\r\nCity, Idaho.\r\n\r\n(31) B. L. D. asks: Can you give me a recipe for making paste for\r\nsharpening razors, knives, etc.? A. Mix the finest emery obtainable\r\nwith a little suet.\r\n\r\n(32) C. B. McM. says: I hear that four gallon measures of different\r\ncapacities are in use, and that The United States standard gallon\r\ncontains 230 cubic inches. In the confusion of text-book statements\r\nsuch as--\"wine gallon = 231 cubic inches,\" \"beer gallon = 282 cubic\r\ninches,\" \"American standard gallon = 58973 grains (Youmans' Chemistry)\r\n= nearly 234 cubic inches,\" and the very extensive ignorance of what\r\nis really correct, please repeat the information in a way that may\r\nbe quoted as authority for the capacity of a United States gallon in\r\ncubic inches, and the weight in grains. A. \"The gallon of the United\r\nStates is the standard or Winchester wine gallon of 231 cubic inches,\r\nand contains 8.3388822 lbs. avoirdupois, or 58372.1754 troy grains of\r\ndistilled water at 39.83 deg. Fah., the barometer being at 30 inches. It\r\nis equal to 3.785207 liters. The gallon of the State of New York is of\r\nthe capacity of 8 lbs. pure water at its maximum density, or\r\n221.184 cubic inches. It is equal to 3.62346 liters.\"--_Appleton's\r\nCyclop[oe]dia._\r\n\r\n(33) S. C. D. says: Please give directions for electrotyping\r\ncylindrical rollers for impressing upon sheets of wax, accurately,\r\nof the proper figure for honeycomb foundations. The figure for the\r\nsurface of the cylinders to be derived from sheets of wax foundation,\r\nhaving the figure correctly impressed upon them. A. This can be done\r\nby coating with plumbago, and then electrotyping with copper, in a way\r\nfamiliar to most printers and to all electrotyping establishments. The\r\nplates can afterwards be bent round a roller, and used to impress the\r\nsheets of wax.\r\n\r\n(34) J. H. T. asks: There is a piece of ground, 100 rods long and 10\r\nrods wide at one end, running to a point at the other, which we wish\r\nto divide into 4 equal lots. Please give a rule. A. Let the 100 rods\r\nbe the base of a triangle, divide it into 4 parts of 25 rods each, and\r\njoin the apex with each of the three dividing points. You will then\r\nhave 4 triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels, which,\r\naccording to Euclid, are equal to each other.\r\n\r\n(35) R. S. asks: What are the chemical qualities of bisulphide\r\nof lime, and how can I prepare it? A. The bisulphide of calcium\r\n(C_{2}S_{5}) is produced by boiling milk of lime with sulphur and\r\nwater, but not long enough to allow the lime to become completely\r\nsaturated. The filtered liquid, on cooling, deposits crystals whose\r\ncomposition agrees with the formula C_{2}S_{2} + 3H_{2}O. Exposed to\r\nthe air, it soon absorbs oxygen, becoming converted into insoluble\r\nsulphate of calcium. Its aqueous solutions are likewise decomposed.\r\nIts reactions with the metallic salts are similar to those of the\r\nalkaline sulphides.\r\n\r\n(36) H. M. S. asks: 1. Of what is the bronze preparation made and how\r\nis it applied to clock fronts? A. Bronze powders are made of various\r\nmetallic alloys. The gold bronze is usually made of Dutch gold\r\n(an alloy of copper and zinc) and of the bisulphide of tin (_aurum\r\nmusivum_). They are usually applied to metal work by means of an oil\r\nsize or japan varnish. 2. In what way can I remove the old bronze? A.\r\nWash first with a solution of washing soda (hot), clean and dry, and\r\nthen rub with a little benzole, alcohol, or ether.\r\n\r\n(37) W. E. W. asks: 1. Of what mixture is the bright red paint usually\r\nput upon axes made? A. It consists of fine vermilion ground with\r\n1 part boiled oil and 2 parts turpentine. 2. Is more than one coat\r\napplied? A. One coat will suffice. It is best applied with a fine\r\nbrush, when the metal is warm.\r\n\r\n(38) C. M. B. asks: Is the odor emitted by the ailanthus tree\r\nunwholesome? A. It is considered so by many, but we have no proof as\r\nto the facts.\r\n\r\n(39) L. S. & Co. ask: Is there anything known which would clean the\r\nhands from paints and lacquers without the use of turpentine? A. A\r\nlittle ammonia and benzine or naphtha, aided by a little sand, is\r\noften used in stubborn cases; put plenty of good soap and warm water,\r\nwith a stiff brush or a small piece of pumicestone, will ordinarily\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n(40) W. P. S., Jr., says: Can you give me a recipe for making _papier\r\nmache_? A. _Papier mache_ is obtained from old paper and the like made\r\ninto a pulp by grinding with milk of lime or lime water, and a little\r\ngum dextrin or starch. This pulp is then pressed into form, coated\r\nwith linseed oil, baked at a high temperature, and finally varnished.\r\nThe pulp is sometimes mixed with clay (kaolin), chalk, etc.; and other\r\nkinds are made of a paste of pulp and recently slaked lime. This is\r\nused for ornamenting wood, etc.\r\n\r\n(41) M. P. B. says, in reply to a correspondent who asked how to\r\nprevent his water filter from getting choked up: Fit in the filter,\r\non the top of the charcoal, a piece of board having in the center a\r\ncircular hole from two to four inches in diameter, according to the\r\nsize of the filter; force in this a sponge so tightly that all the\r\nwater has to pass through it first, but not so as to prevent its free\r\npassage. This sponge will absorb readily the gross impurities of the\r\nwater, and can easily be taken out and cleaned once or twice a week.\r\n\r\n(42) A. C. S. asks: 1. Is there any reason why lightning rod points\r\nshould always be bright, if the points are kept sufficiently sharp? A.\r\nIt makes no difference if the points are not bright. 2. If lightning\r\nrods put up in the ordinary way above the roof terminate in the eaves'\r\nspouting of the house, and said spouting had good ground connections,\r\nwould this not be equal to the best lightning rod, and thereby save\r\nmany feet of rod and many dollars of expense? A. The arrangement you\r\nsuggest would be good. Make a thoroughly good ground connection with\r\nleaders, have all joints well soldered, and you may dispense with the\r\nrod as you propose.\r\n\r\n(43) J. A. W. says: Having occasion to do some copper plating some\r\ntime ago, I dissolved sulphate of copper in water in a glass jar. I\r\nthen poured it off into my battery, and there was some left in the\r\njar. I threw a small piece of iron into it and left it for some days.\r\nI then took it out; and to my surprise, I found that it had been\r\nperfectly plated with copper. Please let me know the cause? A. The\r\nreaction you note is taken advantage of to cheaply copper plate small\r\narticles of cast iron. See answer to J. O. M., p. 347, vol. 36. In the\r\npresence of water, the reaction is as follows:\r\n\r\n     CuSO_{4}   +   Fe   =   FeSO_{4}   +   Cu.\r\n\r\nSulphate of copper. Iron. Sulphate of iron. Copper.\r\n\r\nAs the iron is a more positive metal than copper, it displaced the\r\nlatter in combination with acids, the remaining portions of the iron\r\nbecoming coated with the precipitated copper.\r\n\r\n(44) A. G. asks: Is the silver, for a reflecting telescope, put on the\r\nback of the glass the same as on looking glasses? A. No. Only one\r\nside of the glass is ground and polished to the shape required. The\r\nsilvering is done on this side; and then, with the softest buckskin\r\nand the finest rouge, the surface of the silver is polished for the\r\nreflecting surface. In cities where gas is used, it will not retain\r\nits brilliancy very long; then it requires to be cleaned with nitric\r\nacid and resilvered, which is only the work of a few hours when a\r\nperson has become accustomed to it.\r\n\r\n(45) A. L. B. says: 1. I understand that, in modern chemistry, the\r\nacids and alkalies are the two extremes of a class of substances\r\ncalled hydrates, the only difference being the radical. In the\r\nreaction of nitric acid, HO NO_{2} or HNO_{3} on potassic hydrate, KOH\r\nis KO NO_{2} or KNO_{3}, and H_{2}O. Which molecule loses the oxygen\r\natom, and why should one part with it more than the other?\r\n\r\nA.    HNO_{3}    +    KOH      =    KNO_{3}  + H_{2}O\r\n    Nitric acid      potassic       potassic    water\r\n                     hydrate        nitrate\r\n\r\nIn this reaction the potassium is considered, by virtue of its greater\r\naffinity, as replacing the hydrogen atom in the hydric nitrate; the\r\nhydrogen in turn satisfying the OH group to form water. These hydrates\r\nare similar only in point of constitution. Their chemical deportments\r\nare widely different. 2. What are oxides in modern chemistry? A. The\r\nbodies formed by the direct combination of oxygen with the elementary\r\nbodies are called oxides. With water some of these oxides form\r\nhydrates, as\r\n\r\n    K_{2}O   +  H_{2}O = 2(KHO)\r\n  potassium     water    potassic\r\n    oxide                hydrate\r\n\r\n(46) J. R. M. asks: To have a circular saw run well, should the\r\nmandrel have a little end play if it is desired to relieve the saw\r\nand guides of strain? A. If the saw is not true or the carriage runs\r\ncrooked, end play of the mandrel to the extent of the deviations will\r\nrelieve the strain upon the saw. But if the carriage runs true and the\r\nsaw true, the mandrel should have no end play.\r\n\r\nMINERALS, etc.--Specimens have been received from the following\r\ncorrespondents, and examined, with the result stated:\r\n\r\nM. S. M.--It is a quartz crystal, the opposite sides of which\r\nhave been ground flat, probably by artificial means.--F. B.--It is\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN acknowledges, with much\r\npleasure, the receipt of original papers and contributions upon the\r\nfollowing subjects:\r\n\r\nOn a Battery and Electric Clock.

MOSS, Superintendent.\r\n\r\nTYPE-METAL RELIEF PLATES.\r\n\r\nA SUPERIOR SUBSTITUTE FOR WOOD-CUTS AT MUCH LOWER PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese plates are engraved almost entirely by photo-chemical means, thus\r\navoiding the old, slow and tedious method of engraving on wooden blocks,\r\nwhere the workman is compelled to engrave each line separately by\r\ncutting away the wood around it, often spending many days upon a plate\r\na few inches square.\r\n\r\nIn appearance our relief plates are the same as regular stereotypes,\r\nbeing mounted type high on blocks ready to be set up and printed from,\r\nwith type, on any ordinary press.\r\n\r\nThey can be used directly and will wear as long as any type-metal\r\nplates, but if a great number of impressions are wanted, duplicate\r\n\r\nELECTROTYPES AND STEREOTYPES\r\n\r\ncan be made from them the same as from wood-cuts.\r\n\r\nThey have a printing surface as smooth as glass, and the lines are\r\nengraved deeper than they are in hand-cut plates. Notwithstanding the\r\n_low prices_ at which they can be furnished, they are very much\r\nsuperior  to wood-cuts, and in some classes of work are rapidly\r\ntaking the place of lithography.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES.\r\n\r\nAmong those who manifest their satisfaction with our work, by\r\ncontinued orders, we may mention:--D. Appleton & Co., Scribner & Co.,\r\nFrank Leslie, A. D. F. Randolph & Co., G. W. Carleton & Co., The\r\nAmerican Tract Society, Robert Carter & Bros., Munn & Co., Pub.\r\n\"Iron Age,\" Pub. \"Illustrated Weekly,\" Pub. \"McGee's Illustrated\r\nWeekly,\" and also a large part of the principal publishers and\r\nmanufacturers throughout the country.\r\n\r\nCOPY.\r\n\r\nAlmost all kinds of Prints or Engravings from Wood, Stone, Copper and\r\nSteel may be reproduced directly. _The requisites are, clean, distinct\r\nblack lines or stipple work, on white or only slightly tinted paper.\r\nAll Photographs and Pencil Sketches must first be drawn in ink._ We\r\nkeep a corps of artists constantly employed, trained to do this work\r\nin the best manner. We can make drawings from photographs or tin-types\r\ntaken in the usual way. They may be of any size, but should, of course,\r\nshow the object distinctly.\r\n\r\nDrawings for our use, unless intended to be redrawn, should be on a\r\n_smooth, white_ surface, in _perfectly black_ lines, and usually twice\r\nthe dimensions each way of the desired plate.\r\n\r\nCopy for fac-similes of handwriting should be in _perfectly black ink_,\r\non _smooth white_ paper, written with a full pen, and without use of\r\nblotting paper.\r\n\r\nTIME.\r\n\r\nWhile we can engrave a plate in a few hours that would occupy a\r\nwood-engraver a month, and often do so, yet with the large amount of\r\nwork constantly on hand and promised, we cannot usually engage to fill\r\nan order for a single plate in less than from three to six days;\r\nlarger orders will, of course, require longer time.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF SIZE.\r\n\r\nIn reproducing wood-cut prints, the size can often be considerably\r\nreduced; but if the reduction is great, the lines become so fine and\r\nclose together that they will not print well. Coarse wood-cuts, such\r\nas are generally used in Newspapers, may often be reduced to half\r\ntheir linear dimensions, but _fine_ wood-cuts will admit of but little\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n_Most_ steel plate prints and lithographs will not admit of any\r\nreduction, and even when reproduced, the same size in relief, require\r\nconsiderable care in printing.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of prints generally look bad when much enlarged, as the\r\nlines become very coarse and ragged on the edges; though we have\r\nsometimes made very effective cuts for posters and hand-bills in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of enlargement and reduction the relative proportions\r\nremain the same.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that by redrawing, prints of any\r\nkind can be enlarged or reduced to any desired size.\r\n\r\nPROOFS.\r\n\r\nWe will, whenever desired, furnish tin-type proofs of drawings made by\r\nus, for examination and approval, or correction, before engraving.\r\n\r\nA printed proof is sent with each plate when delivered, which may\r\nalways be equaled or surpassed in actual work with proper usage.\r\n\r\nPRICES.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give a scale of prices by the square inch for\r\nmiscellaneous job-work, as sometimes a small cut two or three inches\r\nsquare may require as much work as another one a foot square. We can,\r\nhowever, give an average inch rate to newspaper publishers whose work\r\nruns uniformly about the same from week to week, especially when they\r\nfurnish us with copy already prepared--such as prints and pen-and-ink\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\nIn sending for estimates, be careful to send us the copy we are to\r\nwork from, with full specifications as to size and quality, and\r\nremember that it is the same with engraving that it is with everything\r\nelse; the price will vary greatly with the quality of work ordered.\r\n\r\nNever, directly or indirectly, ask us to give _you_ better prices than\r\nwe give our other customers, as we try to treat all alike.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of our method of engraving enables us to give\r\nbetter work at lower prices than can be given by any other method for\r\nthe greater part of such work as would be given to wood-engravers,\r\nthough in very small pieces of the poorer grades of work the advantage\r\nis not so great, and in very coarse work such as is usually engraved\r\non mahogany and pine, our process gives us no advantage over the\r\nwood-engraver.\r\n\r\nTo estimate properly upon any piece of work, we must understand just\r\nwhat is wanted. We guarantee all our work to be executed in the style\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nTERMS.\r\n\r\nOUR TERMS are CASH ON DELIVERY, except by special agreement.\r\n\r\nOrders from parties not known to us must be accompanied by an advance\r\nof at least half the price, or satisfactory City reference.\r\n\r\nGoods sent by Express will be C. O. D. Where plates are small they may\r\nbe sent by Mail upon receipt of price and postage. Remittances must be\r\nby draft on New-York or P. O. money order, payable to the order of\r\nPhoto-Engraving Co., or by registered letter--_not by Checks on Local\r\nBanks_.\r\n\r\nWe pledge ourselves to meet the reasonable demands of those who employ\r\nus. If, in any case, we cannot do so, we will refund the money advanced.\r\n\r\n_SEND STAMP FOR ILLUSTRATED CIRCULAR_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWROUGHT IRON BEAMS & GIRDERS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WROUGHT IRON BEAMS & GIRDERS]\r\n\r\nTHE UNION IRON MILLS, Pittsburgh, Pa., Manufacturers of improved\r\nwrought iron Beams and Girders (patented).\r\n\r\nThe great fall which has taken place in the prices of Iron, and\r\nespecially in Beams used in the construction of FIRE PROOF BUILDINGS,\r\ninduces us to call the special attention of Engineers, Architects, and\r\nBuilders to the undoubted advantages of now erecting Fire Proof\r\nstructures; and by reference to pages 52 & 54 of our Book of Sections--\r\nwhich will be sent on application to those contemplating the erection\r\nof fire proof buildings--THE COST CAN BE ACCURATELY CALCULATED, the\r\ncost of Insurance avoided, and the serious losses and interruption to\r\nbusiness caused by fire; these and like considerations fully justify\r\nany additional first cost.

B. ALLEN: Your Governor has been attached to our Corliss engine over\r\none year, and has given perfect satisfaction. The engine was never\r\ngoverned until yours was attached, although we have tried three of the\r\nbest kind of Governors known. When steam or work varied, the speed\r\nwould vary, and we could only run our looms an average of 103 picks per\r\nminute. Since using your Governor, and solely on account of the perfect\r\nsteadiness with which it holds the engine and machinery, we are enabled\r\nto run the looms regularly 112 picks per minute, MAKING AN ACTUAL\r\nINCREASE OF OUR ENTIRE PRODUCTION OF OVER EIGHT PER CENT. Your Governor\r\nsaves coal, saves waste, saves care and labor of the engineer, and\r\nproduces more goods and better goods. I have timed the engine a hundred\r\ntimes, and never found it to vary in the least. It is the honest truth\r\nthat the Allen Governor holds it exactly on speed.\r\n\r\nAddress L. C.
