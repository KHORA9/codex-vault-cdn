The\r\nsimultaneous advance in other sciences allied with astronomy has been,\r\nperhaps, even more remarkable. I am glad to avail myself of the\r\nopportunity afforded by a new issue of “The Earth’s Beginning” to draw\r\nattention to certain recent developments of science which relate in a\r\nvery striking way to the subject of this volume, namely, the famous\r\nNebular Theory of the origin of the solar system. It appears to me that\r\nthese recent developments tend to reduce greatly, even if they do not\r\naltogether remove, the chief outstanding difficulty which has hitherto\r\nretarded the acceptance of the Nebular Theory.\r\n\r\nI have explained in Chapter VI. those views of Helmholtz which have for\r\nso long provided the received explanation of the maintenance of solar\r\nheat. Calculation shows that if the sun’s heat has been maintained by\r\nthe contraction of the primæval nebula—and this was the supposition of\r\nHelmholtz—the orb of day cannot have radiated with its present intensity\r\nfor a period much longer than twenty million years.\r\n\r\nBut from the evidence of geology it must now be admitted that the\r\nexistence of our earth, indeed even that part of its existence during\r\nwhich it has been the abode of life, has endured for a period far in\r\nexcess of that which this calculation would allow. It therefore seems to\r\nfollow that the theory of Helmholtz does not provide an adequate\r\nexplanation of such an amazing phenomenon as the continuance of a\r\nsufficient supply of sunbeams throughout the vast periods demanded by\r\ngeological phenomena.\r\n\r\nThere is another entirely different line of reasoning by which Professor\r\nJohn Joly has recently taught us the immense antiquity of our earth. His\r\nargument is based upon an estimate of the time that must have elapsed\r\nsince the waters of the ocean, which had previously been sustained in\r\nthe great vapours of the atmosphere, were deposited in the ocean beds.\r\nWhen the earth had become sufficiently cool to permit of the vapours now\r\nforming the ocean passing from the gaseous to the liquid form, the\r\noceans descended from the heavens above to the earth beneath in the form\r\nof _fresh_ water. In the lapse of subsequent ages the sea has become\r\nsalt because ordinary river water, which always contains some small\r\nquantity of salt in solution, is continually bearing salt down to the\r\nsea. No doubt water is constantly being abstracted from the sea by\r\nevaporation, but only _fresh_ water is thus removed, so in this cycle of\r\nchange the salt in the sea must be gradually accumulating. Thus, day by\r\nday, though no doubt extremely slowly, the sea has been growing more and\r\nmore salt.\r\n\r\nProfessor Joly has made an estimate of the quantity of salt daily added\r\nto the sea by all the rivers of the globe. He has also made an estimate\r\nof the total quantity of salt which is at present contained in the sea.\r\nHe has thus the means of forming an estimate of the number of years\r\nnecessary for the sea to have become converted from its primæval\r\nfreshness to its present saltness. His result is not a little\r\nastonishing. The saltness of the sea could not be accounted for unless\r\nthe rivers had been running into the sea for at least a hundred million\r\nyears. This period is five times as long as the total period during\r\nwhich the sun could have been shining if the Helmholtzian view were\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many elements of uncertainty in such a calculation.\r\nWe have assumed that the total flow of the rivers is practically\r\nconstant, and that our estimate fairly represents the average salinity\r\nof river water. We have also made a large assumption in supposing that\r\nwe have accurately estimated the total volume of salt in the oceans. But\r\ntaken in conjunction with the geological evidence already referred to,\r\ntaken in conjunction with the immense periods of time that have been\r\nrequired for the evolution of life on the globe by the process of\r\nnatural selection, the conclusion arrived at is inevitable. It seems\r\nimpossible to doubt that the sun must have been shining and that our\r\nsolar system must have existed in practically the same form as it is at\r\npresent for periods enormously greater than would have been possible if\r\nthe heat of the sun had been sustained by the solar contraction only.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty here indicated has been not unjustly considered the most\r\nserious difficulty with which the development of modern physical and\r\nastronomical science has been confronted. The time during which the sun\r\nmust have lasted, according to the received explanation of the source of\r\nits heat and the time during which the sun has actually lasted, as shown\r\nby the facts of geology, present a wide discrepancy. Science demands\r\nthat some reconciliation must be effected, yet how is that to be\r\naccomplished? There is only one possible solution of the problem. It is\r\nobvious that there must have been some vast reserve of heat in the sun\r\nin comparison with which the quantity of heat yielded by the contraction\r\nmay be deemed insignificant. Until this new source of solar energy had\r\nbeen discovered, our knowledge of the physics of the solar system lay\r\nunder a reproach, which it was the bounden duty of men of science to\r\nendeavour to remove.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years lines of research carried on in various\r\ndirections have, in a most unexpected manner, thrown much light on the\r\norigin of the sun’s heat, and, indeed, we may now say that the great\r\ndifficulty which has for so long troubled us no longer exists in a\r\nserious form.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries show that matter possesses stores of energy which, if\r\nnot actually boundless, are enormously in excess of what had been\r\npreviously deemed possible. These stores of energy are available for\r\nsupplying the heat of the sun, and it is easy to show that they are\r\namply sufficient to furnish the necessary sunbeams for even the longest\r\nperiods during which the claims of geology maintain that the sun must\r\nhave been shining.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Professor Sir J. J. Thomson have shown how corpuscles\r\nof matter are sometimes moving with velocities enormously greater than\r\nthose of any celestial body with which astronomy had made us acquainted.\r\nThe case of high corpuscular velocity which is most generally known is\r\nthat presented by radium, the particles from which are being continually\r\nshot forth in myriads. It is quite true that each of these corpuscles is\r\nexcessively small, and it may be useful to give the following\r\nillustration bearing on the subject. Think of a number represented by\r\nunity followed by eighteen cyphers, or more concisely as 10^{18}, and\r\nthink of a line a kilometre long. If that line were divided into 10^{18}\r\nparts, each of those parts would represent the diameter of a corpuscle\r\nof radium. If that line were multiplied by 10^{18}, the result would be\r\na line so long that a ray of light would require a period of no less\r\nthan 100,000 years to pass from one end to the other.\r\n\r\nThese corpuscles of radium are, no doubt, excessively small, but the\r\nvelocity with which they are moving is comparable with the velocity of\r\nlight. When a material object is moving with a velocity of that\r\nmagnitude the energy it contains in virtue of that velocity is indeed\r\nstartling. A very small grain of sand would, if moving with the velocity\r\nof light, contain, in virtue of that motion, the equivalent of more heat\r\nthan could be produced by the combustion of a ton of the best coal. The\r\nlate Dr. W. E. Wilson showed that if an excessively minute percentage of\r\nradium should be found to exist in the sun, it would completely account\r\nfor the sustentation of the solar heat, and the Hon. R. Strutt has shown\r\nthat the minute quantities of radium which he has proved to exist in\r\nterrestrial rocks would enormously protract the earth’s cooling. These\r\ndiscoveries have, in fact, completely changed the outlook on the problem\r\nof the sun’s heat, and, though no doubt much has yet to be done before\r\nthe whole subject is cleared up, the great difficulty may be regarded as\r\nvanquished. Thus, the discovery of radium, and the wonderful phenomena\r\nassociated therewith, has pointed out a possible escape from one of the\r\ngravest difficulties in science.\r\n\r\nThe most notable fact which emerges from the modern study of the\r\nstructure of the heavens is the ever-increasing significance and\r\nimportance of the spiral nebulæ. The following pages will have failed in\r\ntheir object if they have not succeeded in emphasising the fact that the\r\nspiral nebula is, next to a fixed star itself, the most characteristic\r\ntype of object in the material universe. With every increase in the\r\npower of the telescope, and with every development of the application of\r\nphotography to celestial portraiture, the importance of the spiral\r\nstructure in nebulæ becomes of ever-increasing interest.\r\n\r\nBut I revert to this subject here for the purpose of taking notice of a\r\nsuggestive paper by Mr. C. Easton in the “Astrophysical Journal,” Vol.\r\nXII., No. 2, September, 1900, entitled “A New Theory of the Milky Way.”\r\nThis paper advances the striking view that the Milky Way is itself a\r\nspiral nebula, and certainly the considerations adduced by Mr. Easton\r\nseem to justify his remarkable conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is first to be noticed that the Milky Way extends as an irregular\r\nband completely round the heavens, and that it follows very nearly the\r\ncourse of a great circle. The curious convolutions of the Milky Way, the\r\nvarying star densities of its different parts, would, as shown by Mr.\r\nEaston, be completely accounted for if the Milky Way were a mighty\r\nspiral. We view the ordinary celestial spirals from the outside at an\r\nimmense distance in space. We view the Milky Way from a position within\r\nthe circuit of the nebula. It has, however, been shown by Mr. Easton\r\nthat the centre of the Spiral Nebula is not exactly at the sun. The\r\ncentre of the Milky Way is near that superb region of the galaxy which\r\nlies in Cygnus.\r\n\r\nThus, the significance of the spiral structure in the universe becomes\r\ngreatly enhanced. The spirals abound in every part of the heavens; they\r\nare placed in every conceivable position and in every possible plane;\r\nthey have every range in size from comparatively small objects, whose\r\ndestiny is to evolve into a system like our solar system, up to\r\nstupendous objects which include a myriad of such systems. There is now\r\nthe further interest that as the sun and the solar system are included\r\nwithin the Milky Way, and as the Milky Way is a spiral, this earth of\r\nours is itself at this moment a constituent part of a great spiral.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would say that, so far as I have been able to understand the\r\nsubject, it appears to me that every advance in our knowledge of the\r\nheavens tends more and more to support the grand outlines of the Nebular\r\nTheory as imagined by Kant and Laplace.\r\n\r\n                                                                R.

It\r\nmay, I believe, be affirmed without exaggeration that the theme which is\r\nto occupy our attention represents the most daring height to which the\r\nhuman intellect has ever ventured to soar in its efforts to understand\r\nthe great operations of Nature. The earth’s beginning relates to\r\nphenomena of such magnitude and importance that the temporary concerns\r\nwhich usually engage our thoughts must be forgotten in its presence. Our\r\npersonal affairs, the affairs of the nation, and of the empire—indeed,\r\nof all nations and of all empires—nay, even all human affairs, past,\r\npresent, and to come, shrink into utter insignificance when we are to\r\nconsider the majestic subject of the evolution of that solar system of\r\nwhich our earth forms a part. We shall obtain a glimpse of what that\r\nevolution has been in the mighty chapter of the book of Nature on which\r\nwe are now to enter.\r\n\r\nThe nebular theory discloses the beginning of this earth itself. It\r\npoints out the marvellous process by which from original chaos the firm\r\nglobe on which we stand was gradually evolved. It shows how the\r\nfoundations of this solid earth have been laid, and how it is that we\r\nhave land to tread on and air to breathe. But the subject has a scope\r\nfar wider than merely in its relation to our earth. The nebular theory\r\naccounts for the beginning of that great and glorious orb the sun, which\r\npresides over the system of revolving planets, guides them in their\r\npaths, illuminates them with its light, and stimulates the activities of\r\ntheir inhabitants with its genial warmth. The nebular theory explains\r\nhow it comes about that the sun still continues in these latter days to\r\nshine with the brilliance and warmth that it had throughout the past\r\nages of human history and the vastly greater periods of geological time.\r\nThen, as another supreme achievement, it discloses the origin of the\r\nplanets which accompany the sun, and shows how they have come to run\r\ntheir mighty courses; and it tells us how revolving satellites have been\r\nassociated with the planets. The nebular theory has, indeed, a\r\nremarkable relation to all objects belonging to that wonderful scheme\r\nwhich we call the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noticed that the nebular theory often brings facts of\r\nthe most diverse character into striking apposition. As it accounts for\r\nthe continued maintenance of the solar radiation, so it also accounts\r\nfor that beneficent rotation by which each continent, after the\r\nenjoyment of a day under the invigorating rays of the sun, passes in due\r\nalternation into the repose of night. The nebular theory is ready with\r\nan explanation of the marvellous structure revealed in the rings of\r\nSaturn, and it shows at the same time how the volcanoes of the moon\r\nacquired their past phenomenal activity, and why, after ages of\r\nactivity, they have now at last become extinct. With equal versatility\r\nthe nebular theory will explain why a collier experiences increasing\r\nheat as he descends the coalpit, and why the planet Jupiter is marked\r\nwith those belts which have so much interest for the astronomer. The\r\nnebular theory offers an immediate explanation of the earthquake which\r\nwrought such awful destruction at Lisbon, while it also points out the\r\ncause of that healing warmth of the waters at Bath. Above all, the\r\nnebular theory explains that peerless discovery of cosmical chemistry\r\nwhich declares that those particular elements of which the sun is\r\ncomposed are no other than the elements which form the earth beneath our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhen a doctrine of such transcendent importance is proposed for our\r\nacceptance, it is fitting that we should look, in the first instance, to\r\nthe source from which the doctrine has emanated. It would already have\r\nmade good its claim to most careful hearing, though not perhaps to\r\nnecessary acceptance, if it came to us bearing credentials which prove\r\nit to be the outcome of the thought and research of one endowed with the\r\nhighest order of intellect. If the nebular theory had been propounded by\r\nonly a single great leader of thought, the sublimity of the subject with\r\nwhich it deals would have compelled the attention of those who love to\r\nstudy the book of Nature. If it had appeared that a second investigator,\r\nalso famous for the loftiest intellectual achievement, had given to the\r\nnebular theory the sanction of his name, a very much stronger claim for\r\nits consideration would at once have been established. If it should\r\nfurther appear that yet a third philosopher, a man who was also an\r\nintellectual giant, had been conducted to somewhat similar conclusions,\r\nwe should admit, I need hardly say, that the argument had been presented\r\nwith still further force. It may also be observed that there might even\r\nbe certain conditions in the work of the three philosophers which would\r\nmake for additional strength in the cause advocated; if it should be\r\nfound that each of the great men of science had arrived at the same\r\nconclusion irrespective of the others, and, indeed, in total ignorance\r\nof the line of thought which his illustrious compeers were pursuing,\r\nthis would, of course, be in itself a corroboration. If, finally, the\r\nmethods of research adopted by these investigators had been wholly\r\ndifferent, although converging to the establishment of the theory, then\r\neven the most sceptical might be disposed to concede the startling claim\r\nwhich the theory made upon his reason and his imagination.\r\n\r\nAll the conditions that I have assumed have been fulfilled in the\r\npresentation of the nebular theory to the scientific world. It would not\r\nbe possible to point to three names more eminent in their respective\r\nbranches of knowledge than those of Kant, Laplace, and William Herschel.\r\nKant occupies a unique position by the profundity and breadth of his\r\nphilosophical studies; Laplace applied the great discoveries of Newton\r\nto the investigation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, publishing\r\nthe results in his immortal work, _Mécanique Céleste_; Herschel has been\r\nthe greatest and the most original observer of the heavens since the\r\ntelescope was invented. It is not a little remarkable that the great\r\nphilosopher from his profound meditation, the great mathematician from a\r\nlife devoted to calculations about the laws of Nature, the great\r\nobserver from sounding the depths of the firmament, should each in the\r\npursuit of his own line of work have been led to believe that the grand\r\ncourse of Nature is essentially expressed by the nebular theory. There\r\nhave been differences of detail in the three theories; indeed, there\r\nhave been differences in points which are by no means unimportant. This\r\nwas unavoidable in the case of workers along lines so distinct, and of a\r\nsubject where many of the elements were still unknown, as indeed many\r\nare still. Even at the present day no man can give a complete account of\r\nwhat has happened in the great evolution. But the monumental fact\r\nremains that these three most sagacious men of science, whose lives were\r\ndevoted to the pursuit of knowledge, each approaching the subject from\r\nhis own direction, each pursuing his course in ignorance of what the\r\nothers were doing, were substantially led to the same result. The\r\nprogress of knowledge since the time when these great men lived has\r\nconfirmed, in ways which we shall endeavour to set forth, the sublime\r\ndoctrine to which their genius had conducted them.\r\n\r\nImmanuel Kant, whose grandfather was a Scotsman, was born in 1724 at\r\nKönigsberg, where his life was spent as a professor in the University,\r\nand where he died in 1804. In the announcement of the application of the\r\nprinciple of evolution to the solar system, Laplace was preceded by this\r\ngreat German philosopher. The profound thinker who expounded the famous\r\ndoctrine of time and space did not disdain to allow his attention to be\r\nalso occupied with things more material than the subtleties of\r\nmetaphysical investigation. As a natural philosopher Kant was much in\r\nadvance of his time. His speculations on questions relating to the\r\noperations in progress in the material universe are in remarkable\r\nconformity with what is now accepted as the result of modern\r\ninvestigation. Kant outlined with a firmness inspired by genius that\r\nnebular theory to which Laplace subsequently and independently gave a\r\nmore definite form, and which now bears his name.\r\n\r\nKant’s famous work with which we are now concerned appeared in 1755.[1]\r\nIn it he laid down the immortal principle of the nebular theory. The\r\ngreatness of this book is acknowledged by all who have read it, and\r\nnotwithstanding that the progress of knowledge has made it obvious that\r\nmany of the statements it contains must now receive modification, Kant’s\r\nwork contains the essential principle affirming that the earth, the sun,\r\nthe planets, and all the bodies now forming the solar system did really\r\noriginate from a vast contracting nebula. In later years Kant’s\r\nattention was diverted from these physical questions to that profound\r\nsystem of philosophy with which his name is chiefly associated. The\r\nnebular theory is therefore to be regarded as incidental to Kant’s great\r\nlifework rather than as forming a very large and important part of it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  We are now fortunately able to refer the English reader to the work of\r\n  Professor W. Hastie, D.D., entitled “Kant’s Cosmogony,” Glasgow, 1900.\r\n  Kant’s most interesting career is charmingly described in De Quincey’s\r\n  “Last Days of Immanuel Kant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMMANUEL KANT.\r\n(_From an old Print._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last century, while France was in the throes of the\r\nRevolution, a school of French mathematicians was engaged in the\r\naccomplishment of a task which marked an epoch in the history of human\r\nthought. Foremost among the mathematicians who devoted their energies to\r\nthe discussion of the great problems of the universe was the illustrious\r\nLaplace. As a personal friend of Napoleon, Laplace received marked\r\ndistinction from the Emperor, who was himself enough of a mathematician\r\nto be able to estimate at their true value the magnificent results to\r\nwhich Laplace was conducted.\r\n\r\nIt was at the commencement of Kant’s career, and before his great\r\nlifework in metaphysics was undertaken, that he was led to his nebular\r\ntheory of the solar system. In the case of Laplace, on the other hand,\r\nthe nebular theory was not advanced until the close of the great work of\r\nhis life. The _Mécanique Céleste_ had been written, and the fame of its\r\nauthor had been established for all time; and then in a few pages of a\r\nsubsequent volume, called the _Système du Monde_, he laid down his\r\nfamous nebular theory. In that small space he gave a wonderful outline\r\nof the history of the solar system. He had not read that history in any\r\nbooks or manuscripts; he had not learned it from any ancient\r\ninscriptions; he had taken it direct from the great book of Nature.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the caution so characteristic of one whose life had been\r\ndevoted entirely to the pursuit of the most accurate of all the\r\nsciences, Laplace accompanied his announcement of the nebular theory\r\nwith becoming words of warning. The great philosopher pointed out that\r\nthere are two methods of discovering the truths of astronomy. Some\r\ntruths may be discovered by observing the heavenly bodies with\r\ntelescopes, by measuring with every care their dimensions and their\r\npositions, and by following their movements with assiduous watchfulness.\r\nBut there is another totally different method which has enabled many\r\nremarkable discoveries to be made in astronomy; for discoveries may be\r\nmade by mathematical calculations which have as their basis the\r\nnumerical facts obtained by actual observation. This mathematical method\r\noften yields results far more profound than any which can be obtained by\r\nthe astronomer’s telescope. The pen of the mathematician is indeed an\r\ninstrument which sometimes anticipates revelations that are subsequently\r\nconfirmed by actual observation. It is an instrument which frequently\r\nperforms the highly useful task of checking the deductions that might\r\ntoo hastily be drawn from telescopic observations. It is an instrument\r\nthe scope of whose discoveries embraces regions immeasurably beyond the\r\nreach of the greatest telescope. The pen of the mathematician can give\r\nus information as to events which took place long before telescopes came\r\ninto existence—nay, even unnumbered ages prior to the advent of man on\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\nLaplace was careful to say that the nebular theory which he sketched\r\nmust necessarily be judged by a standard different from that which we\r\napply to astronomical truths revealed by telescopic observation or\r\nascertained by actual calculation. The nebular theory, said the great\r\nFrench mathematician, has to be received with caution, inasmuch as from\r\nthe nature of the case it cannot be verified by observation, nor does it\r\nadmit of proof possessing mathematical certainty.\r\n\r\nA large part of these lectures will be devoted to the evidence bearing\r\nupon this famous doctrine. Let it suffice here to remark that the\r\nquantity of evidence now available is vastly greater than it was a\r\nhundred years ago, and furthermore, that there are lines of evidence\r\nwhich can now be followed which were wholly undreamt of in the days of\r\nKant and Laplace. The particular canons laid down by Laplace, to which\r\nwe have just referred, are perhaps not regarded as so absolutely binding\r\nin modern days. If we were to reject belief in everything which cannot\r\nbe proved either by the testimony of actual eye-witnesses or by strict\r\nmathematical deductions, it would, I fear, fare badly with not a few\r\ngreat departments of modern science. It will not be necessary to do more\r\nat present than just to mention, in illustration of this, the great\r\ndoctrine of the evolution of life, which accounts for the existing races\r\nof plants and animals, including even man himself. I need hardly say\r\nthat the Darwinian theory, which claims that man has come by lineal\r\ndescent from animals of a lower type, admits of no proof by mathematics;\r\nit receives assuredly no direct testimony from eye witnesses; and yet\r\nthe fact that man has so descended is, I suppose, now almost universally\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the great German philosopher, as well as in the case of\r\nthe great French mathematician, the enunciation and the promulgation of\r\ntheir nebular theories were merely incidental to the important\r\nscientific undertakings with which their respective lives were mainly\r\noccupied. The relation of the nebular theory to the main lifework of the\r\nthird philosopher I have named, has been somewhat different. When\r\nWilliam Herschel constructed the telescopes with which, in conjunction\r\nwith his illustrious sister, he conducted his long night-watches, he\r\ndiscovered thousands of new nebulæ; he may, in fact, be said to have\r\ncreated nebular astronomy as we now know it. Ever meditating on the\r\nobjects which his telescopes brought to light, ever striving to sound\r\nthe mysteries of the universe, Herschel perceived that between a nebula\r\nwhich was merely a diffused stain of light on the sky, and an object\r\nwhich was hardly distinguishable from a star with a slight haze around\r\nit, every intermediate grade could be found. In this way he was led to\r\nthe splendid discovery which announced the gradual transformation of\r\nnebulæ into stars. We have already noted how the profound mathematician\r\nwas conducted to a view of the origin of the solar system which was\r\nsubstantially identical with that which had been arrived at by the\r\nconsummate metaphysician. The interest is greatly increased when we find\r\nthat similar conclusions were drawn independently from the telescopic\r\nwork of the most diligent and most famous astronomical observer who has\r\never lived. Not from abstract speculation like Kant, not from\r\nmathematical suggestion like Laplace, but from accurate and laborious\r\nstudy of the heavens was the great William Herschel led to the\r\nconception of the nebular theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nThat three different men of science, approaching the study of perhaps\r\nthe greatest problem which Nature offers us from points of view so\r\nfundamentally different, should have been led substantially to the same\r\nresult, is a remarkable incident in the history of knowledge. Surely the\r\ntheory introduced under such auspices and sustained by such a weight of\r\ntestimony has the very strongest claim on our attention and respect.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion on which we are about to enter in these lectures we\r\nmust often be prepared to make a special effort of the imagination to\r\nhelp us to realise how greatly the scale of the operations on which the\r\nattention is fixed transcends that of the phenomena with which our\r\nordinary affairs are concerned. Our eyes can explore a region of space\r\nwhich, however vast, must still be only infinitesimal in comparison with\r\nthe extent of space itself. Notwithstanding all that telescopes can do\r\nfor us, our knowledge of the universe must be necessarily restricted to\r\na mere speck in space, a speck which bears to the whole of space a ratio\r\nless—we might perhaps say infinitely less—than that which the area of a\r\nsingle daisy bears to the area of the continent where that daisy blooms.\r\nBut we need not repine at this limitation; a whole life devoted to the\r\nstudy of a daisy would not be long enough to explore all the mysteries\r\nof its life. In like manner the duration of the human race would not be\r\nlong enough to explore adequately even that small part of space which is\r\nsubmitted for our examination.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely the necessary limits of our senses which restrict\r\nour opportunities for the study of the great phenomena of the universe.\r\nMan’s life is too short for the purpose. That our days are but a span is\r\nthe commonplace of the preacher. But it is a commonplace specially\r\nbrought home to us in the study of the nebular theory. A man of\r\nfourscore will allude to his life as a long one, and no doubt it may be\r\nconsidered long in relation to the ordinary affairs of our abode on\r\nearth; but what is a period of eighty years in the history of the\r\nformation of a solar system in the great laboratory of the universe?\r\nSuch a period then seems to be but a trifle—it is nothing. Eighty years\r\nmay be long enough to witness the growth of children and grandchildren;\r\nbut it is too short for a single heartbeat in the great life of Nature.\r\nEven the longest lifetime is far too brief to witness a perceptible\r\nadvance in the grand transformation. The periods of time demanded in the\r\ngreat evolution shadowed forth by the nebular theory utterly transcend\r\nour ordinary notions of chronology. The dates at which supreme events\r\noccurred in the celestial evolution are immeasurably more remote than\r\nany other dates which we are ever called upon to consider in other\r\ndepartments of science. The time of the story on which we are to be\r\nengaged is earlier, far earlier, than any date we have ever learned at\r\nschool, or have ever forgotten since. The incidents of that period took\r\nplace long before any date was written in figures—earlier than any of\r\nthose very ancient dates which the geologists indicate not by figures\r\nindeed, but by creatures whose remains imbedded in the rocks suffice to\r\ngive a character to the period referred to. The geologist will specify\r\none epoch as that in which the fossilized bone of some huge extinct\r\nreptile was part of a living animal; he may specify another by the\r\nstatement that the shell of some beautiful ammonite was then inhabited\r\nby a living form which swam in the warm primæval seas. The date of our\r\nstory has at least this much certainty: that it is prior—immeasurably\r\nprior—to the time when that marvellous thing which we call life first\r\ncame into being.\r\n\r\nVoltaire has an instructive fable which I cannot resist repeating. It\r\nwill serve, at all events, to bring before us the way in which the lapse\r\nof time ought to be regarded by one who desires to view the great\r\noperations of Nature in their proper proportions. He tells how an\r\ninhabitant of the star Sirius went forth on a voyage of exploration\r\nthrough the remote depths of space. In the course of his travels he\r\nvisited many other worlds, and at length reached Saturn, that majestic\r\norb, which revolved upon the frontier of the solar system, as then\r\nknown. Alighting on the ringed globe for rest and investigation, the\r\nSirian wanderer, in quest of knowledge, was successful in obtaining an\r\ninterview with a stately inhabitant of Saturn who enjoyed the reputation\r\nof exceptional learning and wisdom. The Sirian hoped to have some\r\nimproving conversation with this sage who dwelt on a globe so utterly\r\nunlike his own, and who had such opportunities of studying the majestic\r\nprocesses of Nature in remote parts of the universe. He thought perhaps\r\nthey might be able to compare instructive notes about the constitution\r\nof the suns and systems in their respective neighbourhoods. The visitor\r\naccordingly prattled away gaily. He opened all his little store of\r\nknowledge about the Milky Way, about the Great Bear, and about the great\r\nNebula in Orion; and then pausing, he asked what the Saturnian had to\r\ncommunicate in reply. But the philosopher remained silent. Eagerly\r\npressed to make some response, the grave student who dwelt on the\r\nfrontier globe at last said in effect: “Sirian, I can tell you but\r\nlittle of Nature. I can tell you indeed nothing that is really worthy of\r\nthe great theme which Nature proposes; for the grand operations of\r\nNature are very slow; they are so slow that the great transformations in\r\nprogress around us would have to be watched for a very long time before\r\nthey could be properly understood. To observe Nature so as to perceive\r\nwhat is really happening, it would be necessary to have a long life; but\r\nthe lives of the inhabitants of Saturn are not long; none of us ever\r\nlives more than fifteen thousand years.”\r\n\r\nChange is the order of Nature. Many changes no doubt take place rapidly,\r\nbut the great changes by which the system has been wrought into its\r\npresent form, those profound changes which have produced results of the\r\ngreatest magnificence in celestial architecture are extremely slow. We\r\nshould make a huge mistake if we imagined that changes—even immense\r\nchanges—are not in progress, merely because our brief day is too short a\r\nperiod wherein to perceive them.\r\n\r\nOn the village green stands an oak-tree, a veteran which some say dates\r\nfrom the time of William the Conqueror, but which all agree must\r\ncertainly have been a magnificent piece of timber in the days of Queen\r\nElizabeth. The children play under that tree just as their parents and\r\ntheir grandparents did before them. A year, a few years, even a\r\nlifetime, may show no appreciable changes in a tree of such age and\r\nstature. Its girth does not perceptibly increase in such a period. But\r\nsuppose that a butterfly whose life lasts but a day or two were to pass\r\nhis little span in and about this venerable oak. He would not be able to\r\nperceive any changes in the tree during the insignificant period over\r\nwhich his little life extended. Not alone the mighty trunk and the\r\nbranches, but even the very foliage itself would seem essentially the\r\nsame in the minutes of the butterfly’s extreme old age as they did in\r\nthe time of his life’s meridian or at the earliest moment of his youth.\r\nTo the observations of a spectator who viewed it under such ephemeral\r\nconditions the oak-tree would appear steadfast, and might incautiously\r\nbe deemed eternal. If the butterfly could reflect on the subject, he\r\nmight perhaps argue that there could not be any change in progress in\r\nthe oak-tree, because although he had observed it carefully all his life\r\nhe could not detect any certain alteration. He might therefore not\r\nimprobably draw the preposterous conclusion that the oak-tree must\r\nalways have been just as large and just as green as he had invariably\r\nknown it; and he might also infer that just as the oak-tree is now, so\r\nwill it remain for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—A FAINT DIFFUSED NEBULOSITY (n.g.c. 1499; in\r\nPerseus).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our study of the heavens we must strive to avoid inferences so\r\nutterly fallacious as these which I have here tried to illustrate. Let\r\nit be granted that to our superficial view the sun and the moon, the\r\nstars and the constellations present features which appear to us as\r\neternal as the bole of the oak seemed to the butterfly. But though the\r\nsun may seem to us always of the same size and always of the same\r\nlustre, it would be quite wrong to infer that the lustre and size of the\r\nsun are in truth unchanging. The sun is no more unchanging than the\r\noak-tree is eternal. The sun and the earth, no less than the other\r\nbodies of the universe, are in process of a transformation no less\r\nastonishing than that wonderful transformation which in the course of\r\ncenturies develops an acorn into the giant of the forest. We could not\r\nindeed with propriety apply to the great transformation of the sun the\r\nparticular word growth; the character of the solar transformation cannot\r\nbe so described. The oak-tree, of course, enlarges with its years, while\r\nthe sun, on the other hand, is becoming smaller. The resemblance between\r\nthe sun and the oak-tree extends no further than that a transformation\r\nis taking place in each. The rate at which each transformation is\r\neffected is but slow; the growth of the oak is too slow to be perceived\r\nin a day or two; the contraction of the sun is too slow to be\r\nappreciable within the centuries of human history.\r\n\r\nWhatever the butterfly’s observation might have suggested with regard to\r\nthe eternity of the oak, we know there was a time when that oak-tree was\r\nnot, and we know that a time will come when that oak-tree will no longer\r\nbe. In like manner we know there was a time when the solar system was\r\nutterly different from the solar system as we see it now; and we know\r\nthat a time will come when the solar system will be utterly different\r\nfrom that which we see at present. The mightiest changes are most\r\ncertainly in progress around us. We must not deem them non-existent,\r\nmerely because they elude our scrutiny, for our senses may not be quick\r\nenough to perceive the small extent of some of these changes within our\r\nlimited period of observation. The intellect in such a case confers on\r\nman a power of surveying Nature with a penetration immeasurably beyond\r\nthat afforded by his organs of sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—THE CRAB NEBULA (n.g.c. 1952; in Taurus).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the great oak-tree which has lived for centuries sprang from an\r\nacorn no one can doubt; but what is the evidence on which we believe\r\nthis to have been the origin of a veteran of the forest when history and\r\ntradition are both silent? In the absence of authentic documents to\r\ntrace the growth of that oak-tree from the beginning, how do we know\r\nthat it sprouted from an acorn? The only reason we have for believing\r\nthat the oak-tree has gone through this remarkable development is\r\ndeduced from the observation of other oak-trees. We know the acorn that\r\nhas just sprouted; we know the young sapling as thick as a walking\r\nstick; we know the vigorous young tree as stout as a man’s arm or as his\r\nbody; we know the tree when it first approaches the dignity of being\r\ncalled timber; we can therefore observe different trees grade by grade\r\nin a continuous succession from the acorn to the monarch of five\r\ncenturies. No one doubts for a moment that the growth as witnessed in\r\nthe stages exhibited by several different trees, gives a substantially\r\naccurate picture of the development of any individual tree. Such is the\r\nnature of one of the arguments which we apply to the great problem\r\nbefore us. We are to study what the solar system has been in the course\r\nof its history by the stages which we witness at the present moment in\r\nthe evolution of other systems throughout the universe. We cannot indeed\r\nread the history in time, but we can read it in space.\r\n\r\nThe mighty transformation through which the solar system has passed, and\r\nis even now at this moment passing, cannot be actually beheld by us poor\r\ncreatures of a day. It might perhaps be surveyed by beings whose pulses\r\ncounted centuries, as our pulses count seconds, by beings whose minutes\r\nlasted longer than the dynasties of human history, by beings to whom a\r\nyear was comparable with the period since the earth was young, and since\r\nlife began to move in the waters.\r\n\r\nMay I, with all reverence, try to attune our thoughts to the time\r\nconceptions required in this mighty theme by quoting those noble lines\r\nof the hymn—\r\n\r\n                “A thousand ages in Thy sight\r\n                   Are like an evening gone,\r\n                 Short as the watch that ends the night,\r\n                   Before the rising sun.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                          THE PROBLEM STATED.\r\n\r\nThe Great Diurnal Motion—The Distinction between Stars and Planets—The\r\n    Earth no more than a Planet—Relation of the Stars to the Solar\r\n    System—Contrast between Aldebaran and Mars—Illustration of\r\n    Star-distances—The Celestial Perspective—Illustration of an\r\n    Attractive Force—Instructive Experiments—The Globe and the Tennis\r\n    Ball—The Law of Gravitation—The Focal Ellipse—The Solar System as it\r\n    is now Known—Statement of the Great Problem before us.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN we raise our eyes to the heavens on a clear night, thousands of\r\nbright objects claim our attention. We observe that all these objects\r\nmove as if they were fastened to the inside of an invisible sphere. They\r\nare seen gradually ascending from the east, passing across the south,\r\nand in due course sinking towards the west. The sun and the moon, as\r\nwell as all the other bodies, alike participate in this great diurnal\r\nmovement. The whole scheme of celestial objects seems to turn around the\r\ntwo points in the heavens that we call the Poles, and so far as the pole\r\nin the northern hemisphere is concerned, its position is most\r\nconveniently indicated by the proximity of the well-known Pole Star.\r\n\r\nExcept this great diurnal motion, the vast majority of the bodies on the\r\ncelestial sphere have no other movement easily recognisable, and\r\ncertainly none which it is necessary for us to consider at present. The\r\ngroups in which the stars have been arranged by the poetical imagination\r\nof the ancients exist to-day, as they have existed during all the ages\r\nsince they were first recognised, without any noticeable alteration in\r\ntheir lineaments. The stately belt of Orion is seen to-night as Job\r\nbeheld it thousands of years ago; the stars in the Pleiades have not\r\naltered their positions, relatively to the adjacent stars nor their\r\narrangement among themselves, since the time when astronomers in early\r\nGreece observed them. All the bodies which form these groups are\r\ntherefore known as fixed stars.\r\n\r\nBut besides the fixed stars, which exist in many thousands, and, of\r\ncourse, the sun and the moon, there are other celestial objects, so few\r\nin number as to be counted on the fingers of one hand, which are in no\r\nsense fixed stars. It is quite true that these wandering bodies, or\r\nplanets, as they are generally designated, bear a certain resemblance to\r\nthe fixed stars. In each case the star or the planet appears as a bright\r\npoint, like many other bright points in the heavens, and star and planet\r\nboth participate in the general diurnal motion. But a little attention\r\nwill show that while the stars, properly so called, retain their\r\nrelative places for months and years and centuries, the planets change\r\ntheir places so rapidly that in the course of a few nights it is quite\r\neasy to see, even without the aid of any instrument, that they have\r\nindependent motion.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the movements of these bodies to the movement of the\r\nmoon, which nightly shifts her place over a long track in the sky; and\r\nalthough we are not able to see the stars in the vicinity of the sun,\r\ninasmuch as the brilliant light of the orb quenches the feeble radiance\r\nfrom such stars, there is no doubt that, did we see them, the sun itself\r\nwould seem to move relatively to the stars, just as does the moon and\r\njust as do the planets.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental distinction between stars and planets was noticed by\r\nacute observers of Nature in the very earliest times. The names of the\r\nplanets come to us as survivals from the time when the sun, the moon,\r\nand the stars were objects of worship, and they come to us bearing the\r\nnames of the deities of which these moving globes were regarded as the\r\nsymbols. But it was not the movements of the planets alone which called\r\nfor the notice of the early observers of the skies. The brightness and\r\ncertain other features peculiar to them also attracted the attention of\r\nthe primitive astronomers. They could not fail to observe that when the\r\nbeautiful planet Venus was placed so as to be seen to the greatest\r\nadvantage, her orb was far brighter than any other object in the host of\r\nheaven, the sun and the moon both of course excepted. It was also\r\nobvious that Jupiter at its best exceeded the stars in lustre, and\r\nsometimes approached even to that of Venus itself. Though Mercury was\r\ngenerally so close to the sun as to be invisible among its beams, yet on\r\nthe rare occasions when that planet was seen, just after sunset or just\r\nbefore sunrise, its lustre was such as to mark it out as one of the\r\nremarkable bodies in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThus the astronomers of the earliest ages pointed to the five planets\r\nand the sun and the moon as the seven wandering stars. The diligent\r\nattention of the learned of every subsequent period was given to the\r\ndiscovery of the character of their movements. The problems that these\r\nmotions presented were, however, so difficult that not until after the\r\nlapse of thousands of years did their nature become understood. The\r\nsupreme importance of the earth appeared so obvious to the early\r\nastronomers that it did not at first occur to them to assign to our\r\nearth a position which would reduce it to the same class as any of the\r\ncelestial bodies. The obviously great size of our globe, the fact that\r\nto the uninstructed senses the earth seemed to be at rest, while the\r\nother bodies seemed to be in motion, and many other analogous\r\ncircumstances, appeared to show that the earth must be a body totally\r\ndifferent from the other objects distributed around us in space. It was\r\nonly by slow degrees, and after much observation and reflection, and not\r\na little controversy, that at last the true nature of our system was\r\ndetected. Those who have been brought up from childhood in full\r\nknowledge of the rotation of the earth and of the other fundamental\r\nfacts relating to the celestial sphere, will often find it difficult to\r\nrealise the way such problems must have presented themselves to the\r\nobservers of old, who believed, as for centuries men did believe, that\r\nthe earth was a plane of indefinite extent fixed in space, and that the\r\nsun and the planets, the moon and the stars, were relatively small\r\nbodies whose movements must be accounted for as best they could be,\r\nconsistently with the fixity and flatness of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—JUPITER (May 30th, 1899, 10h. 9.5m.; g.m.t.).\r\n(E. M. Antoniadi.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut at last it began to be seen that the earth must be relegated to a\r\nposition infinitely less important than that which the untutored\r\nimagination assigned to it. It was found that the earth was not an\r\nindefinite plane; it was rather a globe poised in space, without direct\r\nmaterial support from any other body. It was found that the earth was\r\nturning round on its axis: while instead of the sun revolving around the\r\nearth, it was much more correct to say that the earth revolved around\r\nthe sun. The astonishing truth was then disclosed that the five planets,\r\nJupiter and Saturn, Mercury, Venus and Mars, stood in a remarkable\r\nrelation to the earth. For as each of these planets was found to revolve\r\nround the sun, and as the earth also revolved round the sun, the assumed\r\ndifference in character between the earth and the planets tended to\r\nvanish altogether. There was in fact no essential difference. If indeed\r\nthe earth was smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, yet it was considerably\r\ngreater and heavier than Mars or Mercury, and it was almost exactly the\r\nsame size and weight as Venus. There was clearly nothing in the question\r\nof bulk to indicate any marked difference between our earth and the\r\nplanets. It was also observed that there was no distinction to be drawn\r\nbetween the way in which the earth revolved round the sun and the\r\nmovements of the planets. No doubt the earth is not so near the sun as\r\nMercury; it is not so near the sun as even Venus; on the other hand the\r\nsun is nearer the earth than Mars, while Jupiter is a long way further\r\noff than Mars, and Saturn is even beyond Jupiter again. It is these\r\nconsiderations which justify us in regarding our earth as one of the\r\nplanets. We have also to note the overwhelming magnitude of the sun in\r\ncomparison with any one of the planets. It will suffice to give a single\r\nillustration. The sun is more than a thousand times as massive as\r\nJupiter, and Jupiter is the greatest of the planets. This latter noble\r\nglobe is in fact greater than all the rest of the planets put together.\r\n\r\nBut before we can fully realise the circumstances of the solar system,\r\nit will be necessary to see how the stars, properly so called, enter\r\ninto the scheme of things celestial. The stars look so like the planets\r\nthat it has not infrequently happened that even an experienced\r\nastronomer has mistaken one for the other. The planet Mars is often very\r\nlike the star Aldebaran, and there are not a few first-magnitude stars\r\nwhich on a superficial view closely resemble Saturn. But how great is\r\nthe intrinsic difference between a star and a planet! In the first place\r\nwe have to note that every planet is a dark object like this earth of\r\nours, possessing no light of its own, and dependent entirely on the sun\r\nfor the supply of light by which it is illumined. But a star is totally\r\ndifferent. The star is not a dark object, but is really an object which\r\nis in itself intensely luminous and brilliant; the star is in fact a\r\nsun-like body. How then, it may well be asked, does a star like\r\nAldebaran, which is indeed a sun-like body, and in all probability is\r\nquite as large and quite as brilliant as the sun itself, bear even a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to an object like Mars, which would not be\r\nvisible at all were it not for the illumination with which the beams\r\nfrom the sun endow it?\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this striking resemblance is to be sought in the\r\nrelative distances of the two objects. A light which is near to the eye\r\nmay produce an effect quite as great as a very much stronger light which\r\nis further away. The intensity of a light varies inversely as the square\r\nof the distance. If the distance of a light from the eye be doubled,\r\nthen the intensity of that light is reduced to one-fourth. Now Aldebaran\r\nas a sun-like body emits light which is literally millions of times as\r\ngreat as the gleam of sunshine which starts back to us after reflection\r\nfrom Mars; but Aldebaran is, let us say, a million times as far away\r\nfrom us as Mars, and this being so, the light from Aldebaran would come\r\nto us with only a million-millionth part of the intensity that it would\r\nhave if the star were at the same distance as the planet. There can be\r\nno doubt that if Aldebaran were merely at the same distance from the\r\nearth as Mars, then Aldebaran would dispense lustre like a splendid sun.\r\nBy moving Aldebaran further off its light, or rather the light that\r\narrives at the earth, will gradually decrease until by the time that the\r\nstar is a million times as far as Mars, the light that it sends us is\r\nabout equal to that of Mars. If it were removed further still, the light\r\nthat it would send us would become less than that which we receive from\r\nMars, and if still more remote, Aldebaran might cease to be visible\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThis illustration will suffice to explain the fundamental difference\r\nbetween planets and stars, notwithstanding the fact that the two classes\r\nof bodies bear to each other a resemblance which is extremely\r\nremarkable, even if it must be described as being in a sense accidental.\r\nBut we now know that all of the thousands of stars are to be regarded as\r\nbrilliant suns, some of which may not be so far off as Aldebaran, though\r\ndoubtless some are very much further. The actual distances are\r\nimmaterial, for the essential point to notice is that the five planets\r\nare distinguished from the stars, not merely by the fact that they are\r\nmoving, while the stars are at rest, but by the circumstance that the\r\nplanets are comparatively close to each other and close to the sun,\r\nwhile the stars are at distances millions of times as great as the\r\ndistances which the planets are from each other and from the sun.\r\n\r\nWe are now enabled to place the scheme of things celestial in its proper\r\nperspective. I shall suppose that at a point in a field in the centre of\r\nEngland, somewhere near Leamington, let us say, we drive in a peg to\r\nrepresent the sun. Let us draw a circle with that peg as centre, a yard\r\nbeing the radius, and let that circle represent the track in which the\r\nearth goes round the sun. I do not indeed say that the orbit of the\r\nearth is exactly a circle, and the actual shape of that orbit we may\r\nhave to refer to later. As, however, the apparent size of the sun does\r\nnot greatly alter with the seasons, it is evident that the track which\r\nour earth pursues cannot be very different from a circular path. Inside\r\nthis circle which we have drawn with a yard radius, we shall put two\r\nsmaller circles which are to represent the path in which Venus moves,\r\nand the path in which Mercury moves. Outside the path of the earth we\r\nshall draw another circle with a radius of five yards; this will be the\r\nhighway along which the majestic Jupiter wends his way. Inside the path\r\nof Jupiter we shall put a circle which will represent the track of Mars,\r\nand outside the path of Jupiter a circle with ten yards as radius will\r\nrepresent the track of Saturn. In each of these circles we shall suppose\r\nthe corresponding planet to revolve, and the time of revolution will of\r\ncourse be greater the further the planet is from the sun. To complete\r\none of its circuits the earth will require a year, Jupiter twelve years,\r\nwhile Saturn, which in the ancient astronomy moved on the frontier of\r\nthe solar system, will need thirty years to accomplish its mighty\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nWe have thus obtained a plan of the solar system; but now we should like\r\nto indicate the positions which some of the stars are to occupy on the\r\nsame scale. Let us, to begin with, see where the very nearest fixed star\r\nis to be placed. We may suppose that the field at the centre of England,\r\nin which our little diagram has been constructed, is a large one, so\r\nthat we can represent the places of objects which are ten or twenty\r\ntimes as far from the sun as Saturn. It is, however, certain that no\r\nactual field would be large enough to contain within its bounds the\r\npoints which would faithfully represent the positions of even the\r\nnearest fixed stars. The whole county of Warwick would not be nearly big\r\nenough for this purpose; indeed we may say that the whole of England, or\r\nindeed of the United Kingdom, would not be sufficiently extensive. If we\r\nrepresented the star at its true relative distance, it could not be put\r\ndown anywhere within the bounds of the United Kingdom; the nearest\r\nobject of this kind would have to be far away out on the continent of\r\nEurope, or far away out on the Atlantic Ocean, far away down near the\r\nequator, or far away up near the pole. This illustration will at all\r\nevents give some notion of the isolated position of the sun, with the\r\nplanets revolving around it, in relation to the rest of the host of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nWe thus learn that the real scheme of the universe is widely different\r\nfrom that which a superficial glance at the heavens would lead us to\r\nexpect. We are now able to put our system into its proper perspective.\r\nWe are to think of the universe as consisting of a myriad suns, each\r\nsun, however, being so far from the other suns that viewed from any one\r\nof its neighbours it appears only of star-like insignificance. Let us\r\nfix our attention on one of these suns in space, and imagine that around\r\nit, and comparatively close to it, there are a number of small particles\r\nin revolution, the particles being illumined by the light and warmed by\r\nthe heat of the central body to which they are attached. Viewed from one\r\nof those particles, the sun to which they belong would doubtless appear\r\nas a great and glorious orb, while a glance from one of these particles\r\nto any of the other myriad suns in space will show these orbs reduced to\r\nmere points of stellar light by reason of their enormous distance. This\r\nsun and the particles around it, by which of course we shall understand\r\nthe planets, constitute what we know as the solar system. This\r\nillustration may suffice to show the isolation of our system in space,\r\nand that isolation is due to the vast distances by which the sun and its\r\nattendant worlds are separated from the myriads of other bodies which\r\nform the sidereal heavens. We must next, so far as our present subject\r\nrequires it, consider the laws according to which the planets belonging\r\nto that system revolve around the sun.\r\n\r\nLet us think first of a single one of these bodies which, as is most\r\nnatural, we shall take to be the earth itself, and now let us consider\r\nby what agency the movement of the earth around the sun is guided along\r\nthe path which so closely resembles a circle. It must, of course, be\r\nborne in mind that there can be no direct material connection between\r\nthe two bodies; there is no physical bond uniting the earth to the sun.\r\nIt is, however, certain that some influence proceeding from the sun does\r\nreally control the motion. We may perhaps illustrate what takes place in\r\nthe following manner. Here is a globe, and here in my hand I hold a\r\ntennis ball, which is attached to a silken thread, the other end of the\r\nthread being attached to the ceiling. The tennis ball is to hang so that\r\nboth globe and ball are about the same height from the floor. We put the\r\nglobe directly underneath the point on the ceiling from which the silken\r\nthread hangs. If I draw the tennis ball aside and simply release it,\r\nthen of course everybody knows what happens—it is hardly necessary to\r\ntry the experiment—the tennis ball falls at once towards the globe and\r\nstrikes it. We may, if we please, regard that tendency of the tennis\r\nball towards the globe as a sort of attraction which the globe exercises\r\nupon the ball. I must, however, say that this is not a strictly accurate\r\nversion of what actually takes place. The attraction of the earth for\r\nthe tennis ball is of course largely neutralised by the support given by\r\nthe silk thread. There is thus only a slight outstanding component of\r\ngravitation acting on the ball, and this component, which is virtually\r\nthe effective force on the ball, tends to draw the ball directly towards\r\nthe globe. For the purpose of our illustration we may neglect the direct\r\nattraction of the earth altogether; we may omit all thought of the\r\ntension of the silken thread. If there were indeed no attraction from\r\nthe earth, the tennis ball might remain poised in space without falling;\r\nand if it were then attracted by the globe it would fly towards the\r\nglobe just as we actually see it do. We are therefore justified in\r\nregarding the movement of the tennis ball as equivalent to that which\r\nwould be produced if an attractive virtue resided in the globe by which\r\nit pulled the tennis ball. We may also imagine that the globe attracts\r\nthe tennis ball in all its positions; for whatever be the point at which\r\nthe ball is released it starts off straight towards the globe. This is\r\nour first experiment in which, having withdrawn the ball, it is merely\r\nreleased without receiving an initial impulse to one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—NEBULOUS REGION AND STAR-CLUSTER\r\n(n.g.c. 2237-9 in Monoceros).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now try a different experiment. We withdraw the ball, and,\r\ninstead of merely releasing it quietly and allowing it to drop directly\r\nto the globe, we give it a little throw sideways, perpendicular to the\r\nline joining it to the centre of the globe. If we start it with the\r\nproper speed, which a few trials will indicate, the ball can be made\r\nactually to move in a circle round the globe. If the initial speed be\r\nsomewhat different, the path in which the tennis ball moves will not be\r\na circle; it will rather be an ellipse of some form. Even if the speed\r\nbe correct the orbit will always be an ellipse if the direction of the\r\ninitial throw be not perpendicular to the line joining the ball to the\r\ncentre of the globe. We can make the ball describe a very long ellipse\r\nor an ellipse which differs but little from a circle. But I would ask\r\nyou to note particularly that, no matter how we may start the tennis\r\nball into motion, it will, so long as it passes clear of the globe, move\r\nin an ellipse of some kind; but in making this statement we assume that\r\na circle is a particular form of the ellipse.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the lesson which we are to learn from this experiment,\r\nwhich, as it is so easily performed, I would wish everyone to try for\r\nhimself. We have in this simple device an illustration of the movement\r\nof a planet around the sun. We see that this tennis ball can be made to\r\nmove in a circle round the globe, and that as it performs this circular\r\nmovement the globe is all the time attracting the ball towards it. Thus\r\nwe illustrate the important law that when one body moves round another\r\nin a circular path this movement takes place in consequence of a force\r\nof attraction constantly exerted between the large body in the centre\r\nand the body revolving round it.\r\n\r\nThe principle here involved will provide the explanation of the\r\nmovements of the planets round the sun. Each of the planets revolves\r\nround the sun in an orbit which is approximately circular, and each of\r\nthe planets performs that movement because it is continually attracted\r\nby the sun. It is, however, necessary to add that there is a fundamental\r\ndifference between the attraction of the sun for the planets and the\r\nattraction which the globe appeared to exert on the tennis ball in our\r\nexperiment. The difference relates to the character of the forces in the\r\ntwo cases. If the tennis ball be drawn but a very small distance from\r\nthe globe, the attraction between the two bodies is very slight. If the\r\ntennis ball be drawn to a greater distance from the globe, the\r\nattraction is increased correspondingly; and, indeed, in this experiment\r\nthe attraction between the two bodies increases with the distance, and\r\nis said to be proportional to the distance.\r\n\r\nBut the case is very different in that particular kind of attraction by\r\nwhich the sun controls the movements of the planets. This attraction of\r\ngravitation, as it is called, also depends on the distance between the\r\ntwo bodies. But the attraction does not increase when the distance of\r\nthe two bodies increases, for the change lies the other way. The\r\nattraction, in fact, diminishes more rapidly than the distance\r\nincreases. If the distance between the sun and a planet be doubled, then\r\nthe attraction between the two bodies is only a fourth of what the\r\nattraction was between the two bodies in the former case. This\r\ndifference between the law of attraction as it exists in the solar\r\nsystem and the law of attraction which is exemplified in our little\r\nexperiment produces a remarkable contrast in the resulting movements.\r\nThe orbit in each case is, no doubt, an ellipse, but in the case of the\r\ntennis ball revolving round the globe the ellipse is so circumstanced\r\nthat the fixed attracting body stood at its centre, while in the case of\r\na planet revolving round the sun the conditions are not so simple. The\r\nsun does not stand in the centre of the ellipse. The sun is placed at\r\nthat remarkable point of the ellipse so dear to the heart of the\r\ngeometer, which he calls the focus.\r\n\r\nThe solar system consists, first, of the great regulating orb, the sun;\r\nthen of the planets, each of which revolves in its own track round the\r\nsun; each of these tracks is an ellipse, and all these ellipses have\r\nthis in common, that a focus in each is identical with the centre of the\r\nsun. In other respects the ellipses may be quite different. To begin\r\nwith, they are not in the same plane, though it is most important to\r\nnotice, as we shall have to discuss more fully hereafter, that these\r\nplanes are not very much separated. The dimensions of the ellipses vary,\r\nof course, for the different planets, and the periods that the planets\r\nrequire for their several revolutions are also widely different in the\r\ncases of the different bodies; for the greater the diameter of a\r\nplanet’s orbit, the longer is the time required for that planet to\r\ncomplete a single journey round the sun. The sun presiding at the common\r\nfocus of the orbits while governing the planets by its attraction, at\r\nthe same time that it illumines them with its light and warms them by\r\nits rays, gives the conception of the solar system.\r\n\r\nBut the planetary system I have here indicated is merely that system as\r\nknown to the ancients. It is very imperfect from the standpoint of our\r\npresent knowledge. The solar system as we now know it, when telescopes\r\nhave been applied with such marvellous diligence and success to the\r\ndiscovery of new bodies, is a system of much greater complexity. To the\r\nfive old planets have been added two new and majestic planets—Uranus and\r\nNeptune—which revolve outside the track of Saturn. Hundreds of smaller\r\nplanets, invisible to the unaided eye, the asteroids as they are called,\r\nalso describe their ellipses round the presiding luminary. And then just\r\nas the sun controls the planets revolving round it, so do many of the\r\nplanets themselves preside over subordinate systems of revolving globes.\r\nOur earth has a single attendant, the moon, which, under the guidance of\r\nthe earth’s attraction, performs its monthly journey; Jupiter has its\r\nfive moons, while Mars has two, and Saturn eight or nine, besides his\r\nincomparable system of rings, and we must also add that Uranus has four\r\nsatellites and Neptune one. To complete the tale of bodies in the solar\r\nsystem, we should add many thousands of comets, not to mention their\r\nmore humble associates the meteors, which swarm in countless myriads.\r\nFinally, we are to remember that this elaborate system associated with\r\nthe sun is an isolated object in the universe; it is but as a grain of\r\nsand in the extent of infinite space.\r\n\r\nAs we contemplate a system so wonderful, the question naturally arises,\r\nHow came that system into being? We have to consider whether the laws of\r\nnature as we know them afford any rational explanation of the manner in\r\nwhich this system came into existence, any rational explanation of how\r\nthe sun came to shine, how the earth had its beginning, how the planets\r\ncame to revolve round the sun, and to rotate on their own axes. We have\r\nto seek for a rational explanation of the rings of Saturn, and of the\r\nsatellites by which so many planets are attended. We have to show that a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of these remarkable phenomena is forthcoming,\r\nand that it is provided by the famous doctrine of evolution, which it is\r\nthe object of these lectures to discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                             THE FIRE-MIST.\r\n\r\nEvolution of other Bodies in the Universe—The Nebulæ—Estimate of the\r\n    Size of the Great Nebula in Orion—Photograph of that Nebula taken at\r\n    Lick Observatory—The Dumb-bell Nebula—The Crossley Reflector—The\r\n    late Professor Keeler—Astonishing Discovery of New Nebulæ—120,000\r\n    Nebulæ—The Continuous Chain from a Fluid Haze of Light to a Star—The\r\n    Celestial Evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE commence this chapter with a scrutiny of the heavens, to see whether,\r\namong the bodies which it contains, we can discover any which appear at\r\nthis moment to be in the condition through which our system has passed\r\nin some of its earlier stages.\r\n\r\nSo far as our unaided vision is concerned, we can see little or nothing\r\nin the skies which will render us assistance in our present endeavour.\r\nThe objects that we do see in thousands are, of course, the stars, and,\r\nas we have already pointed out, the stars are sun-like objects, and as\r\nsuch have advanced many stages beyond the elementary condition. The\r\nstars are therefore not immediately available for the illustration we\r\nrequire. But when we come to look at the heavens through our telescopes\r\nwe presently find that there are objects which were not visible to the\r\neye, and which are neither stars nor planets. Closer examination of\r\nthese objects with the powerful instruments of modern observatories, and\r\nespecially with the help of those marvellous appliances which have\r\nenabled us to learn the actual chemistry of the heavenly bodies,\r\nsupplies the suggestions that are required.\r\n\r\nFor not only does the telescope reveal myriads of stars which the naked\r\neye cannot detect; not only does it reveal wonderful clusters in which\r\nthousands of stars are grouped closely together so as to form spectacles\r\nof indescribable magnificence, when we take into account the intrinsic\r\nsplendour of each star-like point, but it also reveals totally different\r\nobjects, known as nebulæ. These objects are not stars and are not\r\ncomposed of stars, but are vast extensions of matter existing in a far\r\nmore elementary condition. It is to these curious bodies that we invite\r\nspecial attention at present. It is believed that they offer a\r\nremarkable illustration of the origin of the solar system. We shall\r\nfirst consider the best known object of this class. It is the Great\r\nNebula in Orion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—THE GREAT NEBULA IN ORION (Lick Observatory,\r\nCalifornia).\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here it may be well to give an estimate which will enable us to form\r\nsome notion of the size of this object. We are accustomed to recognise\r\nthe stars as presenting the appearance of mere points of light; but an\r\nobject like the Great Nebula stretches over a wide area of the sky. As\r\nto the actual extent of the space which it occupies we cannot speak with\r\nconfidence. The fact is that with every increase in the power of the\r\ntelescope the nebula appears to encroach more and more on the darkness\r\nof space around. We give in Fig. 6 a representation of the Great Nebula\r\nas it appears on a photographic plate obtained at the Lick Observatory\r\nin California. But no picture can adequately represent the extraordinary\r\ndelicacy of the object and the softness and tenderness with which the\r\nblue nebulous light fades into the black sky around. And it must not be\r\nimagined that the nebula, as seen on this picture, represents the utmost\r\nlimits of the object itself. Every prolongation of the exposure, every\r\nincrease in the sensitiveness of the plate, show more and more the\r\nextent of the nebula.\r\n\r\nWe shall, I doubt not, still be within the bounds of truth if we say\r\nthat the nebula extends over an area ten times as great as that\r\nrepresented in this photograph. But we will take only the area of the\r\nobject as shown in the photograph for the purpose of our calculation.\r\nLet us say that the nebula, as it is here represented, covers about two\r\ndegrees square. I shall not attempt to express in miles the dimensions\r\nof an object so vast. I will try to give a conception of the size of the\r\nGreat Nebula in a different manner. Let us employ the dimensions of our\r\nsolar system for the purpose of comparison. Let us suppose that we draw,\r\nupon the scale of this celestial photograph, a map which shall represent\r\nthe sun in the centre, the earth at her proper distance from the sun,\r\nand Jupiter in his orbit, which is five times the diameter of the\r\nearth’s orbit; and then let us mark the other planets at their\r\nrespective distances, even to Neptune, revolving in his great ellipse,\r\nwith a diameter thirty times that of the earth’s orbit. Let us then take\r\nthe area of the orbit described by Neptune as a unit with which to\r\nmeasure the size of the Great Nebula in Orion. We shall certainly be\r\nwell within the actual truth if we say that a million circles as big as\r\nthat described by Neptune would not suffice to cover the area that is\r\nrepresented on this photograph. This will give some idea of the imposing\r\ndimensions of the Great Nebula in Orion.\r\n\r\nBut I would not have it to be supposed that the Great Nebula in Orion is\r\nunique, unless in respect to its convenient position. The circumstances\r\nof its situation in space happen to make it a comparatively easy object\r\nfor observation by dwellers on the earth. There are, however, very many\r\nother nebulæ, although, with one exception—namely, the Great Nebula in\r\nAndromeda, to which we shall have to refer in a later chapter—they do\r\nnot from our point of observation appear to be so brilliant as the\r\nnebula in Orion. The fact is that by large and powerful telescopes\r\nmultitudes of these nebulæ are revealed, and the number ever tends to\r\nincrease as greater depths in space are sounded. Many of the nebulæ are\r\nobjects which possess sufficient detail to merit the particular\r\nattention which they receive from astronomers. It must, however, be\r\nconfessed that by far the greater number of these objects are so dimly\r\ndiscerned that it is impossible to study their individual\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nAmong the nebulæ which possess sufficient individuality to merit study\r\nfor our present purpose, I must mention the so-called Dumb-bell. This\r\nmost interesting object can be seen in any good telescope. It requires,\r\nhowever, as indeed do all such objects, an instrument of the highest\r\npower to do it justice; in these modern days, however, the eye\r\nobservation of nebulæ through great telescopes has been superseded by\r\nthe employment of the photographic plate. I may take this opportunity of\r\nmentioning that a photograph really shows more details in the nebula\r\nthan can be perceived even by the most experienced eye when applied to\r\nthe most powerful telescope placed in the most favoured situation as to\r\nclimate. Those lovers of nature who desire to observe celestial objects\r\nthrough a great telescope, and have not the opportunity of gratifying\r\ntheir wishes, may perhaps derive consolation from the fact that a good\r\nphotograph actually represents the object much better than any eye can\r\nsee it. More of the nebula is to be seen by looking at the photograph\r\nthan has actually been directly observed by any astronomer.\r\n\r\nWe have chosen the Dumb-bell (Fig. 7) and the Great Nebula in Orion as\r\ncharacteristic examples of this remarkable class of celestial objects;\r\nbut there are many others to which I might refer, some of which we\r\nrepresent in these pages. The Crab Nebula (Fig. 3) and others have been\r\ndistinguished by special names; but I must forbear to dwell further on\r\nthem, and rather hasten to give the results of recent observations which\r\nhave enormously extended our knowledge of the nebulous bodies in the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nLet me first explain the source whence this extraordinary accession to\r\nour knowledge has arisen. We owe it to the astronomers at the Lick\r\nObservatory, that remarkable institution placed on the summit of Mount\r\nHamilton in California. Many important discoveries had already been made\r\nwith the noble instruments with which the famous Lick Observatory had\r\noriginally been endowed by its founder; it is, however, by a recent\r\naddition to its magnificent apparatus that the discoveries have been\r\nmade which are specially significant for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Dr. A. A. Common, the distinguished English astronomer,\r\nconstructed an exquisite reflecting telescope of three feet aperture\r\n(Fig. 8). With this telescope Dr. Common himself obtained notable\r\nresults in photographing the heavens, and his success earned the award\r\nof the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. This telescope\r\npassed into the possession of Mr. E. Crossley, of Halifax, and some time\r\nlater Mr. Crossley presented it to the Lick Observatory. The great\r\nmirror, after its voyage across the Atlantic, was duly erected on the\r\ntop of Mount Hamilton, and fortunately for science Professor Keeler,\r\nwhose early death astronomers of both continents greatly deplore,\r\ndevoted himself to the study of the heavens with its aid. He encountered\r\nmany difficulties, as might perhaps be expected in such a task as he\r\nproposed. His patience and skill, however, overcame them, and though\r\ndeath terminated his labours when his great programme had but little\r\nmore than commenced, the work he had already accomplished has led to\r\nresults of the most striking character. Of the skill that he obtained in\r\nphotographing celestial nebulæ we have given illustrations in Figs. 6\r\nand 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—THE DUMB-BELL NEBULA\r\n(Lick Observatory, California).\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not to the individual portraits of notable nebulæ that we are now\r\nabout to refer. The most striking characteristic of the sidereal heavens\r\nis not to be found in the fact that in one part of the sky we have a\r\nbrilliant Sirius, in another a Capella, and in a third a Canopus, but in\r\nthe fact that the heavens wherever we may test them are strewn with\r\nincalculable myriads of stars, many of which appear faint only on\r\naccount of their distance and not because they are intrinsically small.\r\nIn like manner the remarkable fact with regard to the nebulæ which has\r\nbeen disclosed by Keeler’s memorable researches with the Crossley\r\nReflector is the existence not alone of the great nebulæ, but of\r\nunexpected scores of thousands of small nebulæ, or rather, I should say,\r\nof nebulæ which appear small, though doubtless in many cases these\r\nobjects are intrinsically quite as splendid as the Dumb-bell Nebula or\r\nthe Nebula in Orion. They only seem small in consequence of being many\r\ntimes further from us than are the more famous objects.\r\n\r\nProfessor Keeler’s experience was a remarkable one. He was photographing\r\na well-known nebula with the Crossley Reflector, and he was a little\r\nsurprised to find that on the same plate which gave him the nebula at\r\nwhich he was aiming there were no fewer than seven other small nebulous\r\nobjects previously unknown to astronomers. It at first appeared to him\r\nthat this must be an unusual number of nebulæ to find crowded together\r\non one plate which covered no more than one square degree of the\r\nheavens, an area about five or six times as large as the area of the\r\nfull moon. Subsequent experience, however, showed him that this fact,\r\nhowever astonishing, was not at all unusual. In fact, he found to his\r\namazement that, expose the plate where he pleased, he generally obtained\r\nnew nebulæ upon it, and sometimes even a much larger number than the\r\nseven which so greatly surprised him at first. I may mention just one or\r\ntwo instances. There is a well-known and interesting nebula in Pegasus\r\nwhich Professor Keeler photographed. When he developed the plate, which,\r\nof course, included a considerable region of the heavens in the vicinity\r\nof the particular nebula, he found to his astonishment that, besides the\r\nnebula he wanted, there were not less than twenty other nebulæ on the\r\nplate. But there is a more striking instance even than this. A plate\r\ndirected to a part of the constellation of Andromeda, with the object of\r\ntaking a portrait of a particular nebula of considerable interest, was\r\nfound to contain not only the desired nebula, but no fewer than\r\nthirty-one other new nebulæ and nebulous stars. Nor have we in these\r\nstatements exhausted the nebulous contents of these wonderful plates, if\r\nindeed we have rightly interpreted their nature. Professor Keeler tells\r\nus that he finds upon them a considerable number of objects which in all\r\nprobability are also nebulæ, though they are so small that the telescope\r\nis unable to reveal them in their true character. Examination does\r\nlittle more than show these objects as points of light which, however,\r\nare apparently not stars.\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable paper from which I have taken these facts Professor\r\nKeeler makes an estimate which is founded on the examination of his\r\nplates. If the heavens were to be divided into panels, each one square\r\ndegree in area, there would be about forty thousand panels. It follows\r\nthat if we desired to photograph the whole heavens, and if each of the\r\nplates was to cover one square degree, forty thousand pictures would be\r\nneeded for the representation of the whole celestial sphere. Keeler’s\r\nwork convinced him that such plates taken by the Crossley Reflector\r\nwould, on an average, each show at least three new nebulæ. He admitted\r\nit is quite possible that there may be regions of the sky in which no\r\nnew nebulæ are to be found. But in the regions which he had so far\r\ntested he invariably found more than three nebulæ on each square degree;\r\nindeed, as we have seen, on some of his plates he found a much larger\r\nnumber of these remarkable objects. He therefore said that he makes but\r\na very moderate estimate when he gives a hundred and twenty thousand as\r\nthe probable number of the new nebulæ within the reach of the\r\nphotographic plates of the Crossley Reflector.\r\n\r\nThe enormous extension which these investigations have given to our\r\nknowledge demands the serious attention of all interested in the\r\nheavens. The discoveries of the earlier astronomers had led to the\r\nknowledge of about six thousand nebulæ; the Crossley Reflector at the\r\nLick Observatory has now rendered it practically certain that the number\r\nof nebulæ in the heavens must be at least twenty-fold as great as had\r\nbeen hitherto supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—THE CROSSLEY REFLECTOR\r\n(CONSTRUCTED BY DR. A. A. COMMON F.R.S. AND NOW AT THE LICK\r\nOBSERVATORY).]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn subsequent chapters we are to present the evidence for the belief\r\nthat this earth of ours, as well as the sun and all the other bodies\r\nwhich form the solar system, did once originate in a nebula. According\r\nto this view the materials which at present are found in the globes of\r\nthe solar system were once distributed over a vast extent of space as a\r\nfire-mist, or nebula. It is surely very pertinent to be able to show\r\nthat a nebula, such as we suppose to have been the origin of our system,\r\nis not a mere figment of the imagination. No doubt it is impossible for\r\nus now to show the original nebula from which the solar system has been\r\nevolved. It is nevertheless possible, as we have seen, to show that a\r\nhundred and twenty thousand nebulæ are now actually existing of every\r\ngrade of magnitude. They range from such magnificent objects as the\r\nGreat Nebula in Orion and the Dumb-bell Nebula, down to objects wholly\r\ninvisible, not merely to the unaided eye, but even in the most powerful\r\ntelescope, and only to be discerned as hazy spots of light on the\r\nphotographic plates of an instrument such as the Crossley Reflector.\r\n\r\nThough no eye has seen the actual stages in the grand evolution of our\r\nsolar system, we may at least witness parallel stages in the evolution\r\nthrough which some of the myriads of other nebulæ are now passing. We\r\nfind some of these nebulæ in that excessively diffused condition in\r\nwhich they are devoid of visible structure. Material in this form may be\r\nregarded as the primæval nebula. There is at least one of these\r\nextraordinary objects which is larger a great deal than even the Great\r\nNebula in Orion, but altogether too faint to be seen except by the\r\nphotographic plate. Here we find, as it were, the mother-substance in\r\nits most elementary stage of widest possible diffusion, from which\r\nworlds and systems, it may be, are yet to be evolved. From diffused\r\nobjects such as shown in Fig. 5 we can pass to other nebulæ in which we\r\nsee a certain advance being made in the process by which the nebula is\r\ntransformed from the primitive condition. We can point to yet other\r\nnebulæ in which the advance to a further stage of development is more\r\nand more pronounced. Thus the various stages in the evolution of a\r\nsystem are to be witnessed, not indeed in the transformation of a single\r\nnebula, but by observing a properly arranged series of nebulæ in all\r\ngradations, from the diffused luminous haze to a star with a faint\r\nnebulous surrounding. Such was Herschel’s original argument, and its\r\ncogency has steadily increased from the time he first stated it down to\r\nthe present hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                       NEBULÆ—APPARENT AND REAL.\r\n\r\nThe Globular Star-clusters—Structure of these Objects—Variability of\r\n    Stars in the Cluster—Telescopic Resemblance of a Cluster to a\r\n    Nebula—Resolution of a Nebula—Supposition that all Nebulæ may be\r\n    Clusters—A Criterion for distinguishing a Nebula and a Cluster—Dark\r\n    Lines on a bright Background characterise the Structure of a\r\n    Star—Bright Lines on a dark Background characterise the Structure of\r\n    a Nebula—Characteristics of the Spectrum of a true Nebula and of a\r\n    Resolvable Nebula—Spectra of the Sun and Capella—Spectra of the\r\n    Nebula in Orion and of a White Star compared—Number of Lines in a\r\n    Nebular Spectrum—Criterion of a Nebular Spectrum—Spiral Nebula not\r\n    Gaseous—Solar Spectra during an Eclipse—Bearing on the Nebular\r\n    Theory—Herschel’s Work—The Objection to the Theory—The Objection\r\n    Removed in 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is perhaps hardly any telescopic object more pleasing or more\r\ninstructive than a globular cluster of stars when viewed through an\r\ninstrument sufficiently powerful to do justice to the spectacle. There\r\nare several star-clusters of the class designated as “globular.” The\r\nmost famous of these, or, at all events, the one best known to northern\r\nastronomers, is found in the constellation of Hercules, and is for most\r\npurposes sufficiently described by the expression, “The Cluster in\r\nHercules.” The genuine lover of Nature finds it hard to withhold an\r\nexclamation of wonder and admiration when for the first time, or even\r\nfor the hundredth time, the Cluster in Hercules is adequately displayed\r\nin the field of a first-class telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—THE CLUSTER IN HERCULES.\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. W. E. Wilson, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 9 is a photograph of this celebrated object, which was taken by\r\nDr. W. E. Wilson, F.R.S., at his observatory at Daramona, in Ireland.\r\nThe picture has been obtained from an enlargement of the original\r\nphotograph taken with the telescope in Mr. Wilson’s observatory. It is,\r\nhowever, precisely as Nature has given it, except for this enlargement.\r\nYou will note that towards the margin of the cluster the several stars\r\nare seen separately, and in many cases with admirable distinctness. We\r\ndo, however, occasionally find two or more stars so close together that\r\ntheir images overlap; and, indeed, in the centre of the cluster the\r\nstars are so close together that it is impossible to differentiate them,\r\nso as to see them as individual points of light. We need have no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the cluster is mainly composed of separate stars, although\r\nthe difficulties interposed by our atmosphere, added to the necessary\r\nimperfections of our appliances, make it impossible for us to\r\ndiscriminate the individual stars.\r\n\r\nIn looking at a star group of this particular kind the observer may\r\nperhaps be reminded of a swarm of bees in flight from the hive, for the\r\nstars in the cluster are, on a vast scale, apparently associated in the\r\nsame way as the bees, on a small scale, are associated in the swarm. We\r\nmay also compare the stars in the cluster to the bees in the swarm in\r\nanother respect. Each bee in the swarm is in incessant movement. There\r\ncan be no doubt that each star in a globular cluster is unceasingly\r\nchanging its position with reference to the others. The distance by\r\nwhich the cluster is separated from the earth renders it impossible for\r\nus to see those movements, at all events within those narrow limits of\r\ntime over which our observations have as yet extended; but the laws of\r\nmechanics assure us that the mutual attraction of the stars in this\r\ncluster must give rise to incessant movements, and that this must be the\r\ncase notwithstanding the fact that the relative places of the stars in\r\nthe cluster show no alteration that can be recognised from one year’s\r\nend to another.\r\n\r\nI may, however, mention that though there may be no movements in these\r\nstars great enough to be observed, yet the brightness of some of them\r\nshows most remarkable fluctuations. The investigations of Professor\r\nBailey and other astronomers have, indeed, disclosed such curious\r\nvariability in the brightness of some of these stars that if it were not\r\nfor the exceedingly high authority by which this phenomenon has been\r\nguaranteed we should, perhaps, almost hesitate to believe so startling a\r\nfact. It has, however, been most certainly proved that many of the stars\r\nin certain globular clusters pass through a series of periodical changes\r\nof lustre. The period is a very short one as compared with the periods\r\nof better known variable stars, for in this case twenty-four hours are\r\nmore than sufficient for a complete cycle of changes, and it not\r\ninfrequently happens that in the course of a single quarter of an hour a\r\nstar will lose or gain brightness to the extent of a whole magnitude.\r\nThe phenomenon referred to is at the present moment engaging the careful\r\nattention of astronomers; but it offers a problem of which, indeed, it\r\nis not at present easy to see the solution.\r\n\r\nOur immediate concern, however, with the globular star-clusters relates\r\nto a point hardly of such refinement as that to which I have just\r\nreferred; it is one of a much more elementary nature. The photograph in\r\nthe figure may be considered to represent the Cluster in Hercules as it\r\nwould be seen with a telescope of very considerable visual power, for\r\nthe object would assume a different appearance in a telescope which was\r\nnot first class. The perfection of a really powerful instrument is\r\ntested by its capability of exhibiting as two separate points a pair of\r\nstars which are excessively close together, and which in an instrument\r\nof inferior power cannot be distinguished, but seem fused into a single\r\nobject. The defining power of a telescope—that is to say, its capability\r\nfor separating close double stars—is increased with the size of the\r\ninstrument, always granting, of course, that there is equal optical\r\nperfection in both cases. It follows that the more powerful the\r\ntelescope the more numerous are the stars which can be seen separately\r\nin a globular cluster.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a small telescope be used, or a telescope which, though of\r\nconsiderable size, has not the high optical perfection that is demanded\r\nin the best modern instruments, then adjacent stars are not always to be\r\nseen separately. It may be that the telescope, on account of its small\r\nsize, cannot separate the objects sufficiently, or it may be that the\r\nimperfections of the telescope do not present the star as a point of\r\nlight, but rather as a more or less diffused, luminous disc. In either\r\ncase it may happen that a star overlaps other stars in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and consequently an object which is really a cluster of\r\nseparate stars may fail altogether to present the appearance of a\r\ncluster.\r\n\r\nI have been alluding to something which, as every astronomer knows, is\r\nof practical importance in the observatory. Like every one else who has\r\never used a telescope, I have myself seen the Cluster of Hercules with\r\njust the same misty appearance in a small telescope that an undoubted\r\nnebula possesses in the very finest instrument. It is, accordingly,\r\nsometimes impossible, merely by observation with a small instrument, to\r\ndistinguish between what is certainly a cluster of stars and what is\r\ncertainly a nebula. It has indeed not infrequently happened that an\r\nobserver with a small telescope has discovered what appeared to him to\r\nbe a nebula, and he has recorded it as such; and yet when the same\r\nobject was subsequently examined with an instrument of greater defining\r\npower the nebulous character has been seen to have been wrongly\r\nattributed. The object in such a case is proved to be nothing more than\r\na cluster of stars, of which the individual members are either\r\nintrinsically faint or exceedingly remote; it certainly is not a mass of\r\nthat fire-mist or gaseous material which alone is entitled to be called\r\na nebula.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a question of importance in practical astronomy to\r\ndecide whether objects which appear to be nebulæ are really entitled to\r\nthe name, or whether the nebulous appearance may not be an optical\r\nillusion. The operation by which an object previously deemed to be a\r\nnebula is shown by the application of increased telescopic power to be a\r\ncluster of stars is commonly known as the resolution of a nebula. About\r\nfifty years ago the mighty six-foot reflecting telescope of Lord Rosse,\r\nand other great instruments, were largely employed on this work. It was,\r\nindeed, at that time held to be one of the special tasks which came most\r\nlegitimately within the province of the big telescopes, to show that the\r\nso-called nebulæ of earlier observers were resolvable into star-clusters\r\nunder the superior powers now brought to bear upon them.\r\n\r\nThe success with which this process was applied to many reputed nebulæ,\r\nwhich were thereby shown to be not entitled to the name, led not\r\nunnaturally to a certain conjecture. It was admitted that certain\r\nobjects which had successfully resisted the resolving powers of inferior\r\ninstruments were forced to confess themselves as mere star-clusters when\r\ngreatly increased telescopic power was brought to bear on them; and it\r\nwas conjectured that similar success would attend the attempts to\r\nresolve still other nebulæ. It was even supposed that every object\r\ndescribed as a nebula could only be entitled to bear that designation\r\nprovisionally, only indeed until some telescope of sufficient power\r\nshould have been brought to bear on it. It seemed not unreasonable to\r\nsurmise that every one of the so-called nebulæ is a cluster of stars,\r\neven though a telescope sufficiently powerful to effect its resolution\r\nmight never be actually forthcoming.\r\n\r\nI do not, indeed, believe that this opinion as to the ultimate\r\nresolvability of all nebulæ could have been shared by those who had much\r\npractical experience in the actual observation of these objects with the\r\ngreat telescopes, for the particular classes of nebulæ which in\r\ntelescopes of superior powers resolved themselves into groups of stars\r\nhad a characteristic appearance. After a little experience the observer\r\nsoon learned to recognise those nebulæ which promised to be resolvable.\r\nThe object might not indeed be resolvable with the powers at his\r\ndisposal, but yet from its appearance he often felt that the nebula\r\nwould be probably resolved if ever the time should come that greater\r\npowers were applied to the task.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to illustrate the question at issue by the help of the\r\nphotograph of the Cluster in Hercules in Fig. 9. Each of the stars is\r\nthere distinct, except where they are much crowded in the centre. If,\r\nhowever, the photograph be examined through one of those large lenses\r\nwhich are often used for the purpose, and if the lens be held very much\r\nout of focus, the stars will not be distinguishable separately, and the\r\nwhole object will be merely a haze of light. This illustration may help\r\nto explain how the different optical conditions under which an object is\r\nlooked at may exhibit, at one time as a diffused nebula, an object which\r\nin better circumstances is seen to be a star-cluster.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer who was fortunate enough to have the use of a really\r\ngreat telescope would not fail to notice that, in addition to the\r\nso-called nebulæ already referred to, which were presumably resolvable,\r\nthere were certain other objects, generally characterised by a bluish\r\nhue, which in no circumstances whatever presented the appearance of\r\nbeing composed of separate stars. We now know for certain that these\r\nbluish objects are not clusters of stars, but that they are in the\r\nstrictest sense entitled to the name of nebulæ, and that they are\r\ngaseous masses or mists of fire-cloud. The full demonstration of this\r\nimportant point was not effected until 1864.\r\n\r\nThe fact that so very many of the nebulæ were resolved led not\r\nunreasonably to the presumption that all the nebulæ would in due time\r\nalso yield. But there were many who could not accept this view, and\r\nthere was a long discussion on the subject. At last, however, the\r\nimprovements in astronomical methods have cleared up the question. Sir\r\nW. Huggins has shown that there are two totally distinct classes of\r\nnebulæ, or rather of so-called nebulæ. There are certain nebulæ which\r\ncan be resolved, and there are certain nebulæ which cannot. A nebula\r\nwhich can be resolved would be a veritable cluster of stars, and is not\r\nreally entitled to the name of nebula; a nebula which cannot be resolved\r\nwould be entitled to the name, for it is a volume of gas or of gaseous\r\nmaterial which is itself incandescent. We have been provided with a\r\nbeautiful criterion by which we can decide to which of these classes any\r\nnebulous-looking object belongs.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope is the instrument which discriminates the two different\r\nclasses of objects. This remarkable apparatus, to which we owe so much\r\nin every department of astronomy, receives the beam of light from the\r\ncelestial body. The instrument then analyses the light into its\r\ncomponent rays, and conducts each one of those rays separately to a\r\ndistinct place on the photographic plate. When the photograph is\r\ndeveloped we find on the various parts of the plate the evidence as to\r\nthe class of rays which have entered into the composition of the light\r\nthat has been submitted to this very searching form of examination.\r\n\r\nThe light which comes from a star or any star-like body, including the\r\nsun itself, may first be described. That light, after passing through\r\nthe spectroscope and having been conducted to the photographic plate,\r\nwill produce a picture of dark lines on a bright background; this is, at\r\nleast, the spectrum which a star generally presents. There are, indeed,\r\nmany types of stellar spectra, for there are many different kinds of\r\nstars, and each kind of star is conveniently characterised by the\r\nparticular spectrum that it yields. If the star be one of small\r\nmagnitude, then the lines in its spectrum may be detected, but only with\r\ngreat difficulty. It not infrequently happens that the photograph of the\r\nspectrum of such a star will show no more than a continuous band of\r\nlight without recognisable lines; and this is what occurs in the case of\r\na resolvable nebula, where the stars are so closely associated that the\r\nspectrum of each separate star cannot be distinguished. The spectrum of\r\na resolvable nebula is merely a streak of light, which is the joint\r\neffect of all the spectra. The spectrum is then too faint to show the\r\nrainbow hues which present such beautiful features in the spectrum of a\r\nbright star, as they do in the spectrum of the sun itself.\r\n\r\nI give, in the adjoining figure (Fig. 10), portions of the photographs\r\nof two spectra of celestial objects. They have been taken from the Atlas\r\nof representative stellar spectra in which Sir William and Lady Huggins\r\nhave recorded the results of their great labours. Two spectra are\r\nrepresented in this picture, the uppermost being the spectrum of the\r\nsun, while the lower and broader one is the spectrum of the bright star\r\nCapella. It has not been possible within the limits of this picture to\r\ninclude the whole length of these two spectra, and it must therefore be\r\nunderstood that the photographs given in the Atlas are each about five\r\ntimes as long as the parts which are here reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—SUN AND CAPELLA.\r\nSun above. Capella below.\r\n(_Sir William and Lady Huggins_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the characteristic portions of the spectra selected are sufficient\r\nfor our present argument. It will be noted, first of all, that there is\r\na singular resemblance between the details of the spectrum of the sun\r\nand those of the spectrum of the star. No doubt the breadth of the\r\nstellar picture in the lower line is greater than that of the solar\r\npicture in the upper line; but this point is not significant. The\r\nbreadth of the spectrum of the sun could easily have been made as wide\r\nor wider if necessary. The breadth is immaterial, for the character of a\r\nspectrum is determined not by its breadth, but by those lines which\r\ncross it transversely. It will be seen that there are here a multitude\r\nof lines, some being very dark, and some so faint as to be hardly\r\nvisible. Both spectra exhibit every variety of line, between the\r\ndelicate marks which can barely be seen and the two bold columns on the\r\nright-hand side of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the spectrum is given by the number, the\r\narrangement, the breadth, the darkness, and the definiteness of the\r\nlines by which it is crossed, and the first point that we note is the\r\nremarkable resemblance in these different respects between the two\r\nspectra. The lines are practically identical, at least so far as those\r\nparts of the spectrum represented in this picture are concerned. We have\r\nthus a striking illustration of the important fact, to which we have so\r\noften to make allusion, of the general resemblance of the sun to the\r\nstars. Not only do we know that if the sun were removed about a million\r\ntimes as far as it is at present its light would be reduced to that of a\r\nstar, but that the star Capella transmits to us light consisting\r\nessentially of the same waves as those which enter into a beam of\r\nsunlight. No more striking illustration of the analogy between the sun\r\nand a star can be found than that which is given in this photograph from\r\nthe famous Observatory at Tulse Hill.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be inferred that because the spectra of sun and star are\r\nlike each other, they are therefore absolutely identical. There are many\r\nlines and details to be seen on the actual photographic plate which are\r\ntoo delicate to be reproduced in such copies as it is possible to make.\r\nWhen a close comparison is made on the actual plate itself of the lines\r\nin the solar spectrum and the lines in the spectrum of Capella, it is\r\nobserved that, though they are the same so far as the more important\r\nlines are concerned, yet that there are many lines found in the spectrum\r\nof Capella which are not found in the spectrum of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—SPECTRUM OF NEBULA IN ORION AND SPECTRUM OF A\r\nWHITE STAR.\r\n(_Sir William Huggins, K.C.B._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the spectrum of a nebula properly so called and the\r\nspectrum of a star is well illustrated by the accompanying picture (Fig.\r\n11), in which Sir W. Huggins exhibits the photograph of the spectrum of\r\nthe Nebula in Orion in comparison with the spectrum of a star. The\r\nuppermost of the two is the spectrum of the star. It will be noted that\r\nthis spectrum is very different from that which we have already seen in\r\nCapella. Instead of a vast multitude of lines resembling the lines of\r\nthe solar spectrum, the spectrum of a star of the type here represented,\r\nof which we may take Sirius as the most striking example, exhibits but a\r\nfew lines. We regard them as one system of lines, for we know they are\r\nphysically connected. They are all alike due to the presence of a single\r\nelement in the star, that element being in fact hydrogen. But though the\r\nspectra of Capella and Sirius are so totally different, the differences\r\nrelate only to the distribution of the lines, and to their number,\r\ndarkness, and width. In both cases we observe the characteristic of the\r\nlight from an ordinary bright star, namely, that the spectrum is\r\ncomposed of a bright band with dark lines across it. It ought, perhaps,\r\nto be mentioned here that there are certain very special stars which do\r\nexhibit some bright lines in addition to a more ordinary spectrum; this\r\nis especially the case in the new stars which occasionally appear. Thus\r\nin the case of the new star which appeared in Perseus, in 1901, there\r\nwere several remarkable bright lines. This most interesting object will\r\nbe referred to again in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nWidely different from the spectrum of any star whatever is the lower of\r\nthe two spectra which are shown in the figure. This lower spectrum is\r\nthat of the Great Nebula in Orion. At once we see the fundamental\r\ncharacteristic of a nebula; its spectrum exhibits five bright lines on a\r\ndark field. I do not say that the Great Nebula in Orion has not more\r\nthan five lines; there are indeed many others, for Sir William Huggins\r\nhas himself pointed out a considerable number, and the labours of other\r\nobservers have added still more; but the five lines here set down are\r\nthe principal lines. They are those most easily seen; the others are\r\ngenerally extremely delicate objects arranged in groups of five or six.\r\nBut the lines which this picture shows are quite sufficient to exhibit\r\nthat fundamental characteristic of the nebular spectrum, namely, a\r\nsystem of bright lines on a dark field. I may further mention that\r\ncertain lines in the spectrum indicate the presence of the element\r\nhydrogen in the Great Nebula in Orion, and we owe to Dr. Copeland the\r\ninteresting discovery that the remarkable element helium is also proved\r\nto exist in the nebula.\r\n\r\nThe pictures, at which we have been looking, will suffice to make clear\r\nthe criterion, which astronomers now possess, for deciding whether an\r\nobject which looks nebulous is really a gaseous nebula, or ought rather\r\nto be regarded as a star-cluster. If the object be a star-cluster, then\r\nthe spectrum that it gives will be the resultant of the spectra of the\r\nstars, and this will be a continuous band of light. If the stars are\r\nbright enough, it may be that dark lines can be detected crossing the\r\nspectra, but in the case of the clusters it will be more usual to find\r\nthe continuous band of light so faint that the dark lines, even if they\r\nare there, are not distinguishable.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the object at which we are looking, not being a\r\ncluster of stars, is indeed a mass of glowing gas, or true nebula, then\r\nthe spectrum that it sends us is not the continuous spectrum such as we\r\nexpect from the stars. The spectrum which the nebula proper transmits to\r\nthe plate is said to be discontinuous. In some cases it is characterised\r\nby only a single bright line, and in others there may be two, or three,\r\nor four bright lines, or, as in the case shown in Fig. 11, the number of\r\nbright lines may be as many as five. It may indeed happen, in the case\r\nof some exquisite photographs, that the number of lines in the spectrum\r\nof the nebula will be increased to a score or possibly more. There may\r\nalso be faint traces of a continuous spectrum present, this being due to\r\nthe stars scattered through the object, from which perhaps even the most\r\ngaseous nebula is not entirely free. But the characteristic type of\r\nnebular spectrum is that in which the bright lines, be they one, or few,\r\nor many, are separated by intervals of perfect darkness. When it is\r\nfound that the spectrum of a nebula can be thus described, it is correct\r\nto say that the nebula is truly a gaseous object.\r\n\r\nIn the lists given by Scheiner in his interesting book, “Astronomical\r\nPhotography,” the number of gaseous nebulæ is set down as seventy-three.\r\nOf course no one pretends that this enumeration is exhaustive. It claims\r\nto be no more than a statement of the number of nebulæ which have been\r\nproved, by observations made up to the present, to be of a gaseous\r\ndescription. Seeing that there are, as we have already stated, many\r\nscores of thousands of nebulous-looking objects, it is probable that the\r\nnumber above given is not more than a small fraction of the number of\r\ngaseous nebulæ actually within reach of our instruments.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be assumed that more than half the objects which are\r\ncalled nebulæ are not of the gaseous type. This is a point of some\r\nimportance, which appears to follow from the facts stated by Professor\r\nKeeler in connection with his memorable researches with the Crossley\r\nReflector. In a later chapter we discuss important questions connected\r\nwith what are called _spiral_ nebulæ. We may, however, here record that\r\nno spiral nebulæ have as yet been pronounced gaseous. Professor Keeler\r\nassures us that, of the one hundred and twenty thousand nebulæ which he\r\nestimates to be within reach of the Crossley Reflector, far more than\r\nhalf are of the spiral character. If, then, we assume that the spectra\r\nof spiral nebulæ are always continuous, it seems to follow that less\r\nthan half the nebulous contents of the heavens possesses the\r\ndiscontinuous spectrum which is characteristic of a gaseous object.\r\n\r\nWe are not entitled to assume that a nebula, or reputed nebula, which\r\nshows a continuous spectrum, must necessarily be a cluster, not merely\r\nof star-like bodies, but of bodies with masses comparable with those of\r\nthe ordinary stars. Our argument does most certainly suggest that the\r\nbody which yields a continuous spectrum is not a gaseous body; but it\r\nmay be going too far to assert that therefore it is a cluster of stars\r\nin the ordinary sense. We do often find true nebulæ and star-clusters in\r\nclose association. The Nebula in the Pleiades (Fig. 13) is an example.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to add a few words here as to the physical\r\ndifference between a continuous spectrum and a discontinuous spectrum.\r\nThe light from a body, known to be gaseous, shows through the prism the\r\ndiscontinuous spectrum of bright lines upon a dark background. If, on\r\nthe other hand, a solid be raised to incandescence, such, for instance,\r\nas a platinum wire heated white-hot by an electric current, or a\r\ncylinder of lime submitted to an oxyhydrogen blowpipe, then the spectrum\r\nthat it yields is continuous. All the colours of the rainbow, red,\r\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, are shown in such a\r\nspectrum as a continuous band of light, though the band is not crossed\r\nby dark lines. It would therefore appear that the continuous spectrum is\r\ncharacteristic of an incandescent solid, and the discontinuous spectrum\r\nof a glowing gas. But here it may be urged that the sun presents a\r\ndifficulty. We so often refer to the spectrum of the sun as continuous,\r\nthat it might at first appear as if the spectrum of the sun resembled\r\nthat produced by radiation from a solid body. But, as is well known, the\r\nsun is not a solid body. Even if the sun be solid at the centre, it is\r\ncertainly far from being solid in those superficial regions called the\r\nphotosphere, from which alone its copious radiation is emitted. If the\r\nsun is not a solid body, how comes it to emit a radiation characterised\r\nin the same way as the radiation from a white-hot solid? Why does the\r\nsolar spectrum not exhibit features characteristic of radiation from an\r\nincandescent gas? The point is well worthy of attention; it finds an\r\nexplanation in the nature of the photosphere from which the sun’s\r\nradiation proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe photosphere, though not, of course, to be described as a solid body,\r\ndoes not most certainly, so far as its radiation is concerned, behave\r\nlike a gaseous body. In the glowing clouds of the photosphere the\r\ncarbon, of which they are composed, is not in the gaseous form; it has\r\npassed into solid particles, and it is these particles, in the highest\r\ncondition of incandescence, which emit the solar radiation. Although\r\nthese particles are sustained by the gases of the sun, and are\r\nassociated in aggregations which form the dazzling clouds of the\r\nphotosphere, yet each one of them, in so far as its individual radiation\r\nis concerned, ought to be regarded as a solid body. The radiation from\r\nthe sun is, therefore, essentially not the radiation from an\r\nincandescent gas; it is the radiation from a glowing solid. This is the\r\nreason why the solar spectrum is of the continuous type.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—SOLAR SPECTRA WITH BRIGHT LINES AND DARK LINES\r\nDURING ECLIPSE.\r\n(_Photographed by Captain Hills, R.E._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of Captain Hills, R.E., I am able to show a photograph\r\n(Fig. 12) containing two spectra taken during a recent eclipse, which\r\nwill serve as an excellent illustration of the different points which we\r\nhave been discussing. It is, indeed, true that neither of the spectra,\r\nhere referred to, belongs to nebulæ, whether genuine gaseous objects or\r\nnot. Both of the spectra in Captain Hills’ picture are actually taken\r\nfrom the sun. The conditions under which these spectra were obtained\r\nmake them, however, serve as excellent illustrations of the different\r\ntypes of spectra. We are to notice that the upper band, which contains\r\nwhat is called the “flash” spectrum, exhibits bright lines on a dark\r\nbackground. See, for instance, the two lines so very distinctly marked,\r\nwhich are indicated by the letters H and K. These lines are very\r\ncharacteristic of the solar spectrum, and it may be mentioned that they\r\nare indications of the presence of a well-known element. These lines\r\nprove that the sun contains calcium, the metal of which common lime is\r\nthe oxide. It is, indeed, the presence of this substance in the sun\r\nwhich gives rise to these lines. We shall refer again to this subject in\r\na later chapter.\r\n\r\nAs the upper of the two spectra exhibit H and K as white lines on a dark\r\nbackground, so the lower represents the same lines as dark objects on a\r\nwhite background. These photographs give illustrations of spectra of the\r\ntwo different classes which provide means of discriminating between a\r\ngenuine nebula and an object which, though it looks like a nebula, is\r\nnot itself gaseous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—THE NEBULA IN THE PLEIADES (Exposure 10 hours).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, it will be asked, how can the spectra of the two distinct types\r\nboth be obtained from the sun? The explanation of this point is an\r\ninteresting one. The lower of the two is the ordinary solar spectrum; it\r\nis a continuous spectrum showing dark lines on a bright field. The upper\r\nspectrum, which shows bright lines on a dark field, is produced by a\r\nsmall part of the sun just at the moment when the eclipse is total. The\r\ncircumstances in which that picture was secured will explain its\r\ncharacter. The moon had completely covered that dazzling part of the sun\r\nwhich we ordinarily see, but a region of intensely glowing gaseous\r\nmaterial in the sun’s atmosphere was too high above the surface to be\r\ncompletely hidden by the moon. The spectrum of this region, consisting\r\nof the characteristic bright gaseous lines, is here represented. The\r\nordinary light of the sun being cut off, opportunity was thus afforded\r\nfor the production of the spectrum of the light from the glowing gas,\r\nand we see this spectrum to be of the nebular type.\r\n\r\nAnd now we may bring this chapter to a close by calling attention to the\r\nvery important bearing which its facts have on the Nebular Theory. It is\r\nessential for us to see how far modern investigation and discovery have\r\ntended either to substantiate or refute that famous doctrine which\r\ntraces the development of the solar system from a nebula. To do this it\r\nis necessary to contrast the knowledge of nebulæ, as it exists at\r\npresent, with the knowledge of nebulæ as it existed in the days of Kant\r\nand Laplace and Herschel.\r\n\r\nWe assuredly do no injustice to Kant or to Laplace if we say that their\r\nactual knowledge of the nebulous contents of the heavens was vastly\r\ninferior to that possessed by Herschel. There is not a single\r\nastronomical observation of nebulæ recorded by either Kant or Laplace;\r\nit may be doubted whether either of them ever even saw a nebula. Their\r\nsplendid contributions to science were made in directions far removed\r\nfrom those of the practical observer, who passes long hours of darkness\r\nin the scrutiny of the celestial bodies. Herschel, on the other hand,\r\nwas pre-eminently an observer. His nights were spent in the most\r\ndiligent practical observation of the heavens, and at all times the\r\nnebulæ were the objects which received the largest measure of his\r\nattention, with the result that the knowledge of nebulæ received the\r\nmost extraordinary development from his labours. Earlier astronomers had\r\nno doubt observed nebulæ occasionally, but with their imperfect\r\nappliances only the brighter of these objects were discernible by them.\r\nThe astonishing advance made by the observations of Herschel is only\r\nparalleled by the advance made a hundred years later by the photographs\r\nof Keeler.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that though Herschel observed nebulæ, and\r\ndiscovered nebulæ, and discoursed on nebulæ in papers which to this day\r\nare classics in this important subject, yet not to the last day of his\r\nlife could he have felt sure that he had ever seen a genuine nebula. He\r\nmight have surmised, and he did surmise, that many of the objects he set\r\ndown as nebulæ were actually gaseous objects, but he knew that many\r\napparent nebulæ were in truth clusters of stars, and he had no means of\r\nknowing whether all so-called nebulæ might not belong to the same\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\nIt was not till nearly half a century after Sir William Herschel’s\r\nunrivalled career had closed that the spectroscope was invoked to decide\r\nfinally on the nature of these mysterious objects. That decision, which\r\nhas been of such transcendent importance in the study of the heavens,\r\nwas not pronounced till 1864. In that year Sir William Huggins\r\nestablished the fundamental truth that the so-called nebulæ are not all\r\nstar-clusters, but that the universe does contain objects which are most\r\ncertainly gigantic volumes of incandescent gases.\r\n\r\nThis great achievement provided a complete answer to those who urged an\r\nobjection, which seemed once very weighty, against the Nebular Theory.\r\nIt must be admitted that before 1864 no one could have affirmed with\r\nconfidence that any genuine nebula really existed. It was, therefore,\r\nimpossible for the authors of the Nebular Theory to point to any object\r\nin the heavens which might have illustrated the great principles\r\ninvolved in the theory. The Nebular Theory required that in the\r\nbeginning there should have been a gaseous nebula from which the solar\r\nsystem has been evolved. But the objector, who was pleased to contend\r\nthat the gaseous nebula was a figment of the imagination, could never\r\nhave been effectively silenced by Kant or Laplace or Herschel. It would\r\nhave been useless for them to point to the Nebula in Orion, for the\r\nobjector might say that it was only a cluster of stars, and at that time\r\nthere would have been no way of confuting him.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Nebular Theory had, in respect to this class of\r\nobjector, a much more difficult task than falls to its modern advocate.\r\nThe latter is able to deny in the most emphatic manner that a gaseous\r\nnebula is no more than an imaginary conception.\r\n\r\nThe famous discovery of Sir W. Huggins has removed the first great\r\nobjection to the Nebular Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                          THE HEAT OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nThe Sun to be first considered: its Evolution is in vigorous\r\n    Progress—Considerations on Solar Heat—Size of the Sun—Waste of\r\n    Sun-heat—Langley’s Illustration—Sun in Ancient Days—Problem\r\n    Stated—The Solar Constant explained—Its Value determined—Estimate of\r\n    Radiation from a Square Foot of the Sun—Illustrations of Solar\r\n    Energy—Decline of Solar Energy—The Warehouse of Grain—White-hot\r\n    Globe of Iron would Cool in Forty-eight Years—Sun’s Heat is\r\n    not sustained by Combustion—Inadequacy of Combustion\r\n    Demonstrated—Joule’s Unit—Energy of a Moving Body—Energy of a Body\r\n    moving Five Miles a Second—Energy of the Earth due to its Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT will be convenient to consider different bodies in the solar system,\r\nand to study them with the special object of ascertaining what\r\ninformation they afford as to the great celestial evolution. We cannot\r\nhesitate as to which of the bodies should first claim our attention. Not\r\non account of the predominant importance of our sun to the inhabitants\r\nof the earth, but rather because the sun is nearly a thousand times\r\ngreater than the greatest of the planets, do we assign to the great\r\nluminary the first position in this discussion.\r\n\r\nThe sun is, indeed, especially instructive on the subject with which we\r\nare occupied. By reason of its great mass, the process of evolution\r\ntakes place more slowly in the sun than in the earth or in any other\r\nplanet. Evolution has, no doubt, largely transformed the sun from its\r\nprimæval condition, but it has not yet produced a transformation so\r\nradical as that which the earth and the other planets have undergone. On\r\nthis account the sun can give us information about the process of\r\nevolution which is not to be so easily obtained from any of the other\r\nheavenly bodies. The sun can still exhibit to us some vestiges, if we\r\nmay so speak, of that great primæval nebula from which the whole system\r\nhas sprung.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the sun is indeed one of the most astonishing conceptions\r\nwhich the study of Nature offers to us. Let me try to illustrate it.\r\nThink first of a perfect modern furnace in which even steel itself,\r\nhaving first attained a dazzling brilliance, can be further melted into\r\na liquid that will run like water. Let us imagine the temperature of\r\nthat liquid to be multiplied seven-fold, and then we shall obtain some\r\nconception of the fearful intensity of the heat which would be found in\r\nthat wonderful celestial furnace the great sun in the heavens.\r\n\r\nPonder also upon the stupendous size of that orb, which glows at every\r\npoint of its surface with the astonishing fervour that this illustration\r\nsuggests. The earth on which we stand is a mighty globe; yet what are\r\nthe dimensions of our earth in comparison with those of the sun? If we\r\nrepresent the earth by a grain of mustard seed, then on the same scale\r\nthe sun should be represented by a cocoanut. We may perhaps obtain a\r\nmore impressive conception of the proportions of the orb of day in the\r\nfollowing manner. Look up at the moon which revolves round the heaven,\r\ndescribing as it does so majestic a track that it is generally at a\r\ndistance of two hundred and forty thousand miles from the earth. Yet the\r\nsun is so large that if there were a hollow globe equally great, and the\r\nearth were placed at its centre, the entire orbit of the moon would lie\r\ncompletely within it.\r\n\r\nEvery portion of that stupendous desert of flame is pouring forth\r\ntorrents of heat. It has, indeed, been estimated that the heat which\r\nissues from an area of two square feet on the sun would more than\r\nsuffice, if it could be all utilised, to drive the engines of the\r\nlargest Atlantic liner between Liverpool and New York.\r\n\r\nThis solar heat is scattered through space with boundless prodigality.\r\nNo doubt the dwellers on the earth do receive a fair supply of sunbeams;\r\nbut what is available for the use of mankind can be hardly more than an\r\ninfinitesimal fraction of what the sun emits. We shall scarcely be so\r\npresumptuous as to suppose that the sun has been designed solely for the\r\nbenefit of the poor humanity which needs light and warmth. The heat and\r\nlight daily lavished by the sun would suffice to warm and to illuminate\r\ntwo thousand million globes, each as great as the earth. If, indeed, it\r\nwere true that the only object of the sun’s existence was to cherish\r\nthis immediate world of ours, then all we can say is that the sun\r\ncarries on its business in a most outrageously wasteful manner. What\r\nwould be thought of the prudence of one who, having been endowed with a\r\nfortune of ten million pounds, spent one single penny of that vast sum\r\nin a profitable manner and dissipated every other penny and every other\r\npound of his fortune in aimless extravagance? But this is apparently the\r\nway in which the sun manages its affairs, so far as our earth is\r\nconcerned. Out of every ten million pounds worth of heat issuing from\r\nthe glorious orb of day, we on this earth secure one pennyworth, and all\r\nbut that solitary pennyworth seems to be utterly squandered. We may say\r\nit certainly is squandered so far as humanity is concerned. What,\r\nindeed, its actual destination may be science is unable to tell.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the great question as to how the sun’s heat is sustained.\r\nHow is it that this career of tremendous prodigality has not ages ago\r\nbeen checked by absolute exhaustion? Every child knows that the fire on\r\nthe hearth will go out unless coal be provided. The workman knows that\r\nhis devouring furnace in the ironworks requires to be incessantly stoked\r\nwith fresh supplies of fuel. How, then, comes it that the wonderful\r\nfurnace on high can still continue, as it has continued for ages, to\r\npour forth its amazing stores of heat without being exhausted?\r\n\r\nProfessor Langley has supplied us with an admirable illustration showing\r\nthe amount of fuel which would be necessary, if indeed it were by\r\nsuccessive additions of fuel that the sun’s heat was sustained. Suppose\r\nthat all the coal-seams which underlie England and Scotland were made to\r\nyield up their stores; that the vast coalfields in America, Australia,\r\nChina, and elsewhere were compelled to contribute every combustible\r\nparticle they contained; suppose, in fact, that we extracted from this\r\nearth every ton of coal which it possesses in every isle and every\r\ncontinent; suppose that this mighty store of fuel, sufficient to supply\r\nall the wants of the earth for centuries, were to be accumulated, and\r\nthat by some mighty effort that mass were to be hurled into the sun and\r\nwere forthwith to be burnt to ashes; there can be no doubt that a\r\nstupendous quantity of heat would be produced. But what is that heat in\r\ncomparison, we do not say with the heat of the sun, but with the daily\r\nexpenditure of the sun’s heat? How long, think you, would the combustion\r\nof so vast a mass of fuel provide for the sun’s expenditure? We are\r\ngiving deliberate expression to a scientific fact when we say that a\r\nconflagration which destroyed every particle of coal contained in this\r\nearth would not generate as much heat as the sun lavishes in the tenth\r\npart of every single second. During the few minutes that you have been\r\nreading these words a quantity of heat has gone for ever from the sun\r\nwhich is five thousand times as great as all the heat that ever has been\r\nor ever will be produced by the combustion of the coal that this earth\r\nhas furnished.\r\n\r\nBut we have still another conception to introduce before we can\r\nappreciate the full significance of the sun’s extraordinary expenditure\r\nof heat and light. We have been thinking of the sun as it shines now;\r\nbut as the sun shines to-day, so it has shone yesterday, and so it shone\r\na hundred years ago, a thousand years ago; so it shone in the earliest\r\ndawn of history, so it shone during those still remoter periods when\r\ngreat animals flourished which have now vanished for ever; so the sun\r\nshone during those remote ages when life began to dawn on an earth which\r\nstill was young. We do not, indeed, say that the intensity of the\r\nsunbeams has remained actually uniform throughout a period so vast; but\r\nthere is every reason to believe that throughout these illimitable\r\nperiods the sun has expended its radiance with the most lavish\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nA most important question is suggested by these considerations. The\r\nconsequences of frightful extravagance are known to us all; we know that\r\nsuch conduct tends to bankruptcy and ruin; and certainly the expenditure\r\nof heat by the sun is the most magnificent extravagance of which our\r\nknowledge gives us any conception. Accordingly, the important question\r\narises: As to how the consequences of such awful prodigality have been\r\nhitherto averted. How is it that the sun is still able to draw on its\r\nheat reserve, from year to year, from century to century, from æon to\r\næon, ever squandering two thousand million times as much heat as that\r\nwhich genially warms our temperate regions, as that which draws forth\r\nthe exuberant vegetation of the tropics or which rages in the desert of\r\nSahara? That is the great problem to which our attention has to be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nWe must first ascertain, with such precision as the circumstances\r\npermit, the actual amount of heat which the sun pours forth in its daily\r\nradiation. The determination of this quantity has engaged the attention\r\nof many investigators, and the interpretation of their results is by no\r\nmeans free from difficulty. It is to be observed that what we are now\r\nseeking to ascertain is not exactly a question of temperature, but of\r\nsomething quite different. What we have to measure is a quantity of\r\nheat, which is to be expressed in the proper units for quantities of\r\nheat. The unit of heat which we shall employ is the quantity of heat\r\nnecessary to raise one pound of water through one degree Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe _solar constant_ is the number of units of heat which fall, in one\r\nminute, on one square foot of a surface placed at right angles to the\r\nsun’s rays, and situated at the mean distance of the earth from the sun.\r\nWe shall suppose that losses due to atmospheric absorption have been\r\nallowed for, so that the result will express the number of units of heat\r\nthat would be received in one minute on a square foot turned directly to\r\nthe sun, and at a distance of 93,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—THE SUN (July 8th, 1892).\r\n(Royal Observatory, Greenwich.)\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a matter for determination by actual observation and\r\nmeasurement. Theory can do little more than suggest the precautions to\r\nbe observed and discuss the actual figures which are obtained. There\r\nhave been many different methods of making the observations, and the\r\nresults are somewhat various, but the discrepancies are not greater than\r\nmight be expected in an investigation of such difficulty. The mean value\r\nwhich has been arrived at is _fourteen_, and the fundamental fact with\r\nregard to the solar radiation which we are thus enabled to state is that\r\nan area of a square foot exposed at right angles to the solar rays, at a\r\ndistance of 93 millions of miles, will in each minute receive from the\r\nsun as much heat as would raise one pound of water fourteen degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the total radiation from the sun must suffice to convey,\r\nin each minute, to the surface of a sphere whose radius is 93,000,000\r\nmiles, fourteen units of heat per square foot of that surface. This\r\nradiation comes from the surface of the sun. It is easily shown that the\r\nheat from each square foot on the sun will have to supply an area of\r\n46,000 square feet at the distance of the earth. Hence the number of\r\nunits of heat emerging each minute from a square foot on the sun’s\r\nsurface must be about 640,000.\r\n\r\nWe can best realise what this statement implies by finding the amount of\r\ncoal which would produce the same quantity of heat. It can be shown that\r\nthe heat given out by each square foot of the solar surface in one\r\nminute will be equivalent to that produced in the combustion of\r\nforty-six pounds of coal. If the sun’s heat were sustained by\r\ncombustion, every part of the sun’s surface as large as the grate of an\r\nordinary furnace would have to be doing at least one hundred times as\r\nmuch heating as the most vigorous stoking could extract from any actual\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nThe radiation of heat from a single square foot of the solar surface in\r\nthe course of a year must, therefore, be equivalent to the heat\r\ngenerated in the combustion of 11,000 tons of the best coal. If we\r\nestimate the annual coal production of Great Britain at 250,000,000\r\ntons, we find that the total heat which this coal can produce is not\r\ngreater than the annual emission from a square of the sun’s surface of\r\nwhich each side is fifty yards. All the coal exported from England in a\r\nyear does not give as much heat as the sun radiates in the same time\r\nfrom every patch on its surface which is as big as a croquet ground.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no greater question in the study of Nature than that\r\nwhich enquires how the sun’s heat is sustained so that the radiation is\r\nstill dispensed with unstinted liberality. If we are asked how the sun\r\ncan be fed so as to sustain this expenditure, we have to explain that\r\nthe sun is not really fed. If, then, it receives no adequate supplies of\r\nenergy from without, we have to admit that the sun must be getting\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nI ought, indeed, to anticipate objection by at once making the admission\r\nthat the sun does receive some small supply of energy from the meteors\r\nwhich are perennially drawn into it. The quantity of energy they yield\r\nis, however, insignificant in comparison with the solar expenditure of\r\nheat. We may return to this subject at a later period, and it need not\r\nnow receive further attention.\r\n\r\nWe must deliberately face the fact that the energy of the sun is\r\nbecoming exhausted. But the rate of exhaustion is so slow that it\r\naffords no prospect of inconvenience to humanity; it does not excite\r\nalarm. We grant that we are not able to observe by instrumental means\r\nany perceptible diminution of solar energy. Still, as we know that\r\nenergy is being steadily dissipated from the sun, and that energy cannot\r\nbe created from nothing, it is certain the decline is in progress. But\r\nthe reserve of energy which the sun possesses, and which can be\r\nultimately rendered available to sustain the radiation, is so enormous\r\nin comparison with the annual expenditure of energy, that myriads of\r\ncenturies will have to elapse before there is any appreciable alteration\r\nin the effectiveness of the sun.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate the point by likening the sun to a grain warehouse, in\r\nwhich 2,500 tons of wheat can be accommodated. Let us suppose that the\r\nwarehouse was quite full at the beginning, and that the wheat was to be\r\ngradually abstracted, but only at the rate of one grain each day. Let us\r\nfurther suppose that no more wheat is to be added to that already in the\r\nwarehouse, and let us assume that the wheat thus stored away experiences\r\nno deterioration and no loss whatever except by the removal of one grain\r\nper diem. It is easy to see that very many centuries would have to\r\nelapse before the grain in that warehouse had decreased to any\r\nappreciable extent.\r\n\r\nWith a consumption at the rate of a single grain a day a ton of corn\r\nwould last about four thousand years, and 2,500 tons of corn would\r\naccordingly last about ten million years. It follows, therefore, that if\r\nthe grain in that store were consumed at the rate of only one grain per\r\nday the warehouse would not be emptied for ten million years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—I. SPECTRUM OF THE SUN.\r\nII. SPECTRUM OF ARCTURUS.\r\n(_Professor H. C. Lord._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quantity of heat, or rather the reserve of energy equivalent to\r\nheat, which still remains stored up in the sun bears to the quantity of\r\nheat which the sun radiates away in a single day a ratio something like\r\nthat which a single grain of corn bears to 2,500 tons of corn.\r\n\r\nThe sun’s potential store of heat is no doubt very great, though not\r\nindefinitely great. That heat is beyond all doubt to be ultimately\r\nexhausted; but the reserve is so prodigious that for the myriads of\r\nyears during which the sun has been subjected to human observation there\r\nhas been no appreciable alteration in the efficiency of radiation.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the sun was merely a white-hot globe cooling\r\ndown, and that the solar radiation was to be explained in this way. But\r\na little calculation will prove it to be utterly impossible that the\r\nheat of the great luminary could be so accounted for. A knowledge of the\r\ncurrent expenditure of solar heat shows that if the sun had been a globe\r\nof iron at its fusing point, then at the present rate of radiation it\r\nwould have sunk to the temperature of freezing water in forty-eight\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought here to explain a point which might otherwise cause\r\nmisapprehension. For our ordinary sources of artificial heat we, of\r\ncourse, employ some form of combustion. Whenever combustion takes place\r\nthere is chemical union between the carbon or other fuel, whatever it\r\nmay be, and the oxygen of the atmosphere. A certain quantity of carbon\r\nenters into chemical union with a definite quantity of oxygen, and, as\r\nan incident in the process, a definite quantity of heat is liberated. So\r\nmuch coal, for instance, requires for complete combustion so much air,\r\nand, granted a sufficiency of air, the union of the carbon and hydrogen\r\nin the coal will give out a certain quantity of heat which may be\r\nconveniently expressed by the number of pounds of water which that heat\r\nwould suffice to transform into steam. It is necessary to observe that\r\nthere are definite numerical relations among these quantities. The\r\nquantity of heat that can be produced by the combustion of a pound of\r\nany particular substance will depend upon the nature of that substance.\r\n\r\nAs chemical combination is the main source of the artificial heat which\r\nwe employ for innumerable purposes on the earth, it seems proper to\r\nconsider whether it can be any form of chemical combination which\r\nconstitutes the source of the heat which the sun radiates in such\r\nabundance. It is easy to show that the solar radiation cannot be thus\r\nsustained. The point to which I am now referring was very clearly\r\nillustrated by Helmholtz in a lecture he delivered many years ago on the\r\norigin of the planetary system.\r\n\r\nTo investigate whether the solar heat can be attributed to chemical\r\ncombination, we shall assume for the moment that the sun is composed of\r\nthose particular materials which would produce the utmost quantity of\r\nheat for a given weight; in other words, that the sun is formed of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen in quantities having the same ratio as that in which\r\nthey should be united to form water. The quantity of heat generated by\r\nthe union of known weights of oxygen and hydrogen has been ascertained,\r\nby experiments in the laboratory, to exceed that which can be generated\r\nby corresponding weights of any other materials. We can calculate how\r\nmuch of the sun’s mass, if thus constituted, would have to enter into\r\ncombination every hour in order to generate as much heat as the hourly\r\nradiation of the sun. We need not here perform the actual calculation,\r\nbut merely state the result, which is a very remarkable one. It shows\r\nthat the heat arising from the supposed chemical action would not\r\nsuffice to sustain the radiation of the sun at its present rate for more\r\nthan 3,000 years. Thirty centuries is a long time, no doubt, yet still\r\nwe must remember that it is no more than a part even of the period known\r\nto human history. If, indeed, it had been by combustion that the sun’s\r\nheat was produced, then from the beginning of the sun’s career as a\r\nluminous object to its final extinction and death could not be longer\r\nthan 3,000 years, if we assumed that its radiation was to be uniformly\r\nthat which it now dispenses.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that we are dealing only with elements known to us\r\nand with which terrestrial chemists are familiar, and it may be urged\r\nthat the sun possibly contains materials whose chemical union produces\r\nheat in much greater abundance than do the elements with which alone we\r\nare acquainted. But this argument cannot be sustained. One of the most\r\nimportant discoveries of the last century, the discovery which perhaps\r\nmore than any other has tended to place the nebular theory in an\r\nimpregnable position, is that which tells us that the elements of which\r\nthe sun is composed are the same as the elements of which our earth is\r\nmade. We shall have to refer to this in detail in a later chapter. We\r\nnow only make this passing reference to it in order to dismiss the\r\nnotion that there can be unknown substances in the sun whose heat of\r\ncombustion would be sufficiently great to offer an explanation of the\r\nextraordinary abundance of solar radiation.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more characteristic of the physical science of the\r\ncentury just closed than the famous discovery of the numerical relation\r\nwhich exists between heat and energy. We are indebted to the life-long\r\nlabours of Joule, followed by those of many other investigators, for the\r\naccurate determination of the fundamental constant which is known as the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat. Joule showed that the quantity of heat\r\nwhich would suffice to raise one pound of water through a single degree\r\nFahrenheit was the precise equivalent of the quantity of energy which\r\nwould suffice to raise 772 pounds through a height of one foot. It would\r\nbe hard to say whether this remarkable principle has had a more profound\r\neffect on practical engineering or on the course of physical science. In\r\npractical engineering, the knowledge of the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat will show the engineer the utmost amount of work that could by any\r\nconceivable apparatus be extracted from the heat potentially contained\r\nin a ton of coal. In the study of astronomy the application of the same\r\nprinciple will suffice to explain how the sun’s heat has been sustained\r\nfor illimitable ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—BROOKS’ COMET AND METEOR TRAIL.\r\n(November 13th, 1893. Exposure 2 hours.)\r\n(_Photographed by Professor E. E. Barnard._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to commence with a little calculation, which will\r\nprovide us with a result very instructive when considering celestial\r\nphenomena in connection with energy. We have seen that the unit of\r\nheat—for so we term the quantity of heat necessary to raise a pound of\r\nwater one degree—will suffice, when transformed into mechanical energy,\r\nto raise 772 pounds through a single foot. This would, of course, be\r\nprecisely the same thing as to raise one pound through 772 feet. Suppose\r\na pound weight were carried up 772 feet high and were then allowed to\r\ndrop. The pound weight would gradually gather speed in its descent, and,\r\nat the moment when it was just reaching the earth, would be moving with\r\na speed of about 224 feet a second. We may observe that the work which\r\nwas done in raising the body to this height has been entirely expended\r\nin giving the body this particular velocity. A weight of one pound,\r\nmoving with a speed of 224 feet a second, will therefore contain, in\r\nvirtue of that motion, a quantity of energy precisely equivalent to the\r\nunit of heat.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known principle in mechanics that if a body be dropped from\r\nany height, the velocity with which it would reach the ground is just\r\nthe velocity with which the body should be projected upwards from the\r\nground in order to re-ascend to the height from which it fell (the\r\nresistance of the air is here overlooked as not having any bearing upon\r\nthe present argument). Thus we see that a weight, moving with a velocity\r\nof 224 feet per second, contains within itself, in virtue of its motion,\r\nenergy adequate to make it ascend against gravity to the height of 772\r\nfeet. That is to say, this velocity in a body of a pound weight can do\r\nfor the body precisely what the unit of heat can do for it; hence we say\r\nthat in virtue of its movement the body contains a quantity of energy\r\nequal to the energy in the unit of heat.\r\n\r\nLet us now carry our calculation a little further. If a pound of good\r\ncoal be burned with a sufficient supply of oxygen, and if every\r\nprecaution be taken so that no portion of the heat be wasted, it can be\r\nshown that the combustion of the coal is sufficient to produce 14,000\r\nunits of heat. In other words, the burning of one pound of coal ought to\r\nbe able to raise 14,000 pounds of water one degree, or 140 pounds of\r\nwater a hundred degrees, or 70 pounds of water two hundred degrees. I do\r\nnot mean to say that efficiency like this will be attained in the actual\r\ncircumstances of the combustion of coal in the fireplace. A pound of\r\ncoal does, no doubt, contain sufficient heat to boil seven gallons of\r\nwater; but it cannot be made to effect this, because the fireplace\r\nwastes in the most extravagant manner the heat which the coal produces,\r\nso that no more than a small fraction of that heat is generally rendered\r\navailable. But in the cosmical operations with which we shall be\r\nconcerned we consider the full efficiency of the heat; and so we take\r\nfor the pound of coal its full theoretical equivalent, namely, 14,000\r\nthermal units. Let us now find the quantity of energy expressed in\r\nfoot-pounds[2] to which this will correspond. It is obtained by\r\nmultiplying 14,000 units of heat by 772, and we get as the result\r\n10,808,000. That is to say, a pound of good coal, in virtue of the fact\r\nthat it is combustible and will give out heat, contains a quantity of\r\nenergy which is represented by ten or eleven million foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  A foot-pound is the amount of energy required to raise a pound weight\r\n  through a height of one foot.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the question in another way. Let us think of a piece of\r\ncoal in rapid motion; if the coal weighed a pound, and if it were moving\r\nat 224 feet a second, then the energy it contains in consequence of that\r\nvelocity would, as we have seen, correspond to one thermal unit. We\r\nhave, however, to suppose that the piece of coal is moving with a speed\r\nmuch higher than that just stated; and here we should note that the\r\nenergy which a moving body possesses, in virtue of its velocity,\r\nincreases very rapidly when the speed of that body increases. If the\r\nvelocity of a moving body be doubled, the energy that it possesses\r\nincreases fourfold. If the velocity of the body be increased tenfold,\r\nthen the energy that it possesses will be increased a hundredfold. More\r\ngenerally, we may say that the energy of a moving body is proportional\r\nto the square of the velocity with which the body is animated. Let us,\r\nthen, suppose that the piece of coal, weighing one pound, is moving with\r\na speed as swift as a shot from the finest piece of artillery, that is\r\nto say, with a speed of 2,240 feet a second; and as this figure is ten\r\ntimes 224, it shows us that the moving body will then possess, in virtue\r\nof its velocity, the equivalent of one hundred units of heat.\r\n\r\nBut we have to suppose a motion a good deal more rapid than that\r\nobtained by any artillery; we shall consider a speed rather more than\r\nten times as fast. It is easy to calculate that if the piece of coal\r\nwhich weighs a pound is moving at the speed of five miles a second, the\r\nenergy that it would possess in consequence of that motion would\r\napproximate to 14,000 thermal units. In other words, we come to the\r\nconclusion that any body moving with a velocity of five miles a second\r\nwill possess, in virtue of that velocity, a quantity of energy just\r\nequal to the energy which an equally heavy piece of good coal could\r\nproduce if burnt in oxygen, and if every portion of the heat were\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that the speed of five miles a second here supposed\r\nrepresents a velocity much in excess of any velocity with which we are\r\nacquainted in the course of ordinary experience. It is more than ten\r\ntimes as fast as the speed of a rifle bullet. But a velocity of five\r\nmiles a second is not at all large when we consider the velocities of\r\ncelestial bodies. We want this fact relating to the energy in a piece of\r\ncoal to be remembered. We shall find it very instructive as our subject\r\ndevelops, and therefore we give some illustrations with reference to it.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the earth as it moves round the sun is more than eighteen\r\nmiles a second—that is to say, it is three and a half times the critical\r\nspeed of five miles. In virtue of this speed the earth has a\r\ncorresponding quantity of energy. To find the equivalent of that energy\r\nit must, as already explained, be remembered that the energy of a moving\r\nbody is proportional to the square of its velocity; it follows that the\r\nenergy of the earth, due to its motion round the sun, must be almost\r\ntwelve times as great as the energy of the earth would be if it moved at\r\nthe rate of only five miles a second. But, we have already seen that a\r\nbody with the velocity of five miles a second would, in virtue of that\r\nmotion, be endowed with a quantity of energy equal to that which would\r\nbe given out by the perfect combustion of an equal weight of coal. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that this earth of ours, solely in consequence of\r\nthe fact that it is moving in its orbit round the sun, is endowed with a\r\nquantity of energy twelve times as great as all the energy that would be\r\ngiven out in the combustion of a mass of coal equal to the earth in\r\nweight. This may seem an astonishing statement; but its truth is\r\nundoubted. If it should happen that the earth came into collision with\r\nanother body by which its velocity was stopped, the principle of the\r\nconservation of energy tells us that this energy, which the earth has in\r\nconsequence of its motion, must forthwith be transformed, and the form\r\nwhich it will assume is that of heat. Such a collision would generate as\r\nmuch heat as could be produced by the combustion of twelve globes of\r\nsolid coal, each as heavy as the earth. We may indeed remark that the\r\ncoal-seams in our earth’s crust contain, in virtue of the fact that they\r\npartake of the earth’s orbital motion, twelve times as much energy as\r\nwill ever be produced by their combustion.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that such collisions as we have here imagined\r\ndo occasionally happen in some parts of space. Those remarkable new\r\nstars which from time to time break out derive, in all probability,\r\ntheir temporary lustre from collisions between bodies which were\r\npreviously non-luminous. But we need not go so far as inter-stellar\r\nspace for a striking illustration of the transformation of energy into\r\nheat. In the pleasing phenomena of shooting stars our own atmosphere\r\nprovides us with beautiful illustrations of the same principle. The\r\nshooting star so happily caught on Professor Barnard’s plate (Fig. 16)\r\nmay be cited as an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                   HOW THE SUN’S HEAT IS MAINTAINED.\r\n\r\nThe Contraction of a Body—Helmholtz Explained Sun-heat—Change of a\r\n    Mile every Eleven Years in the Sun’s Diameter—Effect of\r\n    Contraction on Temperature—The Solar Constant—Limits to the\r\n    Solar Shrinkage—Astronomers can Weigh the Sun—Density of the\r\n    Sun—Heat Developed by the Falling Together of the Solar\r\n    Materials—Contraction of Nebula to Form the Earth—Heat Produced\r\n    in the Earth’s Contraction—Similar Calculation about the\r\n    Sun—Earth and Sun Contrasted—Heat Produced in the Solar\r\n    Contraction from an indefinitely Great Nebula—The Coal-Unit\r\n    Employed—Calculation of the Heat given out by the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE law which declares that a body which gives out heat must in general\r\nsubmit to a corresponding diminution in volume appears, so far as we can\r\njudge, to be one of those laws which have to be obeyed not alone by\r\nbodies on which we can experiment, but by bodies throughout the extent\r\nof the universe. The law which bids the mercury ascend the stem of the\r\nthermometer when the temperature rises, and descend when the temperature\r\nfalls, affords the principle which explains some of the grandest\r\nphenomena of the heavens. Applied to the solar system it declares that\r\nas the sun, in dispensing its benefits to the earth day by day, has to\r\npour forth heat, so in like manner must it be diminishing in bulk.\r\n\r\nAssuming that this principle extends sufficiently widely through time\r\nand space, we shall venture to apply its consequences over the mighty\r\nspaces and periods required for celestial evolution. We disdain to\r\nnotice the paltry centuries or mere thousands of years which include\r\nthat infinitesimal trifle known as human history. Our time conceptions\r\nmust undergo a vast extension.\r\n\r\nIt was Helmholtz who first explained by what agency the sun is able to\r\ncontinue its wonderful radiation of heat, notwithstanding that it\r\nreceives no appreciable aid from chemical combination. Helmholtz pointed\r\nout that inasmuch as the sun is pouring out heat it must, like every\r\nother cooling body, contract. We ought not, indeed, to say every cooling\r\nbody; it would be more correct to say, every body which is giving out\r\nheat, for the two things are not necessarily the same. Indeed, strange\r\nas it may appear, it would be quite possible that a mass of gas should\r\nbe gaining in temperature even though it were losing heat all the time.\r\nAt first this seems a paradox, but the paradox will be explained if we\r\nreflect upon the physical changes which the gas undergoes in consequence\r\nof its contraction.\r\n\r\nLet us dwell for a moment on the remarkable statement that the sun is\r\nbecoming gradually smaller. The reduction required to sustain the\r\nradiation corresponds to a diminution of the diameter by about a mile\r\nevery eleven years. It may serve to impress upon us the fact of the\r\nsun’s shrinkage if we will remember that on that auspicious day when\r\nQueen Victoria came to the throne the sun had a diameter more than five\r\nmiles greater than it had at the time when her long and glorious career\r\nwas ended. The sun that shone on Palestine at the beginning of the\r\npresent era must have had a diameter about one hundred and seventy miles\r\ngreater than the sun which now shines on the Sea of Galilee. This\r\nprocess of reduction has been going on for ages, which from the human\r\npoint of view we may practically describe as illimitable. The alteration\r\nin the sun’s diameter within the period covered by the records of man’s\r\nsway on this earth may be intrinsically large; it amounts no doubt to\r\nseveral hundreds of miles. But in comparison with the vast bulk of the\r\nsun this change in its magnitude is unimportant. A span of ten thousand\r\nyears will certainly include all human history. Let us take a period\r\nwhich is four times as long. It is easy to calculate what the diameter\r\nof the sun must have been forty thousand years ago, or what the diameter\r\nof the sun is to become in the next forty thousand years. Calculated at\r\nthe rate we have given, the alteration in the sun’s diameter in this\r\nperiod amounts to rather less than four thousand miles. This seems no\r\ndoubt a huge alteration in the dimensions of the orb of day. We must,\r\nhowever, remember that at the present moment the diameter of the sun is\r\nabout 863,000 miles, and that a loss of four thousand miles, or\r\nthereabouts, would still leave a sun with a diameter of 859,000 miles.\r\nThere would not be much recognisable difference between two suns of\r\nthese different dimensions. I think I may say that if we could imagine\r\ntwo suns in the sky at the same moment, which differed only in the\r\ncircumstance that one had a diameter of 863,000 miles and the other a\r\ndiameter of 859,000 miles, it would not be possible without careful\r\ntelescopic measurement to tell which of the two was the larger.\r\n\r\nAfter a contraction has taken place by loss of heat, the heat that still\r\nremains in the body is contained within a smaller volume than it had\r\noriginally. The temperature depends not only on the actual quantity of\r\nheat that the mass of gas contains, but also on the volume through which\r\nthat quantity of heat is diffused. If there be two equal weights of gas,\r\nand if they each have the same absolute quantity of heat, but if one of\r\nthem occupies a larger volume than the other, then the temperature of\r\nthe gas in the large volume will not be so high as the temperature of\r\nthe gas in the smaller volume. This is indeed so much the case, that the\r\nreduction of volume by the loss of heat may sometimes have a greater\r\neffect in raising the temperature than the very loss of heat which\r\nproduced the contraction has in depressing it. On the whole, therefore,\r\na gain of temperature may be shown. This is what, indeed, happens not\r\nunfrequently in celestial bodies. The contraction having taken place,\r\nthe lesser quantity of heat still shows to such advantage in the reduced\r\nvolume of the body, that no decline of temperature will be perceptible.\r\nIt may happen that simultaneously with the decrease of heat there is\r\neven an increase of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe principle under consideration shows that, though the sun is now\r\ngiving out heat copiously, it does not necessarily follow that it must\r\nat the same time be sinking in temperature. As a matter of fact,\r\nphysicists do not know what course the temperature of the sun is\r\nactually taking at this moment. The sun may now be precisely at the same\r\ntemperature at which it stood a thousand years ago, or it may be cooler,\r\nor it may be hotter. In any case it is certain that the change of\r\ntemperature per century is small, too small, in fact, to be decided in\r\nthe present state of our knowledge. We cannot observe any change, and to\r\nestimate the change from mechanical principles would only be possible if\r\nwe knew much more about the interior of the sun than we know at present.\r\n\r\nWe are forced to the conclusion that the energy of the sun, by which we\r\nmean either its actual heat or what is equivalent to heat, must be\r\ncontinually wasting. A thousand years ago there was more heat, or its\r\nequivalent, in the sun than there is at present. But the sun of a\r\nthousand years ago was larger than the sun that we now have, and the\r\nheat, or its equivalent, a thousand years ago may not have been so\r\neffective in sustaining the temperature of the bigger sun as the lesser\r\nquantity of heat is in sustaining the temperature of the sun at the\r\npresent day. It will be noticed that the argument depends essentially on\r\nthe alteration of the size of the sun. Of course if the orb of day had\r\nbeen no greater a thousand years ago than it is now, then the sun of\r\nthose early days would not only have contained more heat than our\r\npresent sun, but it must have shown that it did contain more heat. In\r\nother words, its temperature would then certainly have been greater than\r\nit is at present.\r\n\r\nThus we see the importance—so far as radiation is concerned—of the\r\ngradual shrinking of the sun. The great orb of day decreases, and its\r\ndecrease has been estimated numerically. We cannot, indeed, determine\r\nthe rate of decrease by actual telescopic measurement of the sun’s disc\r\nwith the micrometer; observations extending over a period of thousands\r\nof years would be required for this purpose. But from knowing the daily\r\nexpenditure of heat from the sun it is possible to calculate the amount\r\nby which it shrinks. We cannot conveniently explain the matter fully in\r\nthese pages. Those who desire to see the calculation will find it in the\r\nAppendix. Suffice it to say here that the sun’s diameter diminishes\r\nabout sixteen inches in every twenty-four hours. This is an important\r\nconclusion, for the rate of contraction of the solar diameter is one of\r\nthe most significant magnitudes relating to the solar system.\r\n\r\nIt was Helmholtz who showed that the contraction of the sun’s diameter\r\nby sixteen inches a day is sufficient to account for the sustentation of\r\nthe solar radiation. For immense periods of time the heat may be\r\ndispensed with practically unaltered liberality. The question then\r\narises as to what time-limit may be assigned to the efficiency of our\r\norb. Obviously the sun cannot go on contracting sixteen inches a day\r\nindefinitely. If that were the case, a certain number of millions of\r\nyears would see it vanish altogether. The limit to the capacity of the\r\nsun to act as a dispenser of light and heat can be easily indicated. At\r\npresent the sun, in its outer parts at all events, is strictly a\r\nvaporous body. The telescope shows us nothing resembling a solid or a\r\nliquid globe. The sun seems composed of gas in which clouds and vapours\r\nare suspended. In the sun’s centre the temperature is probably very much\r\ngreater than any temperature which can be produced by artificial means;\r\nit would doubtless be sufficient not only to melt, but even to drive\r\ninto vapour the most refractory materials. On the other hand, the\r\nenormous condensing pressure to which those materials are submitted by\r\nthe stupendous mass of the sun will have the effect of keeping them\r\ntogether and of compressing them to such an extent that the density of\r\nthe gas, if indeed we may call it gas, is probably as great as the\r\ndensity of any known matter. The fact is that the terms liquids, gases,\r\nand solids cease to retain intelligible distinctions when applied to\r\nmaterials under such pressure as would be found in the interior of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAstronomers can weigh the sun. It may well be imagined that this is a\r\ndelicate and difficult operation. It can, however, be effected with but\r\nlittle margin of uncertainty, and the result is a striking one. It\r\nserves no useful purpose to express the sun’s weight as so many myriads\r\nof tons. It is more useful for our present purpose to set down the\r\ndensity of the sun, that is to say, the ratio of the weight of the orb,\r\nto that of a globe of water of the same size. This is the useful form in\r\nwhich to consider the weight of the sun. Astronomers are accustomed to\r\nthink of the weight of our own earth in this same fashion, and the\r\nresult shows that the earth is rather more than five times as heavy as a\r\nglobe of water of the same size. We can best appreciate this by stating\r\nthat if the earth were made of granite, and had throughout the density\r\nwhich we find granite to possess at the surface, our globe would be\r\nabout three times as heavy as a globe of water of the same size. If,\r\nhowever, the earth had been entirely made of iron, it would be more than\r\nseven times as heavy as a globe of water of the same size. As the earth\r\nactually has a density of 5, it follows that our globe taken as a whole\r\nis heavier than a globe of granite of the same size, though not so heavy\r\nas a globe of iron.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of density there is a remarkable contrast between the sun\r\nand the earth. The sun’s density is much less than that of the earth. Of\r\ncourse it will be understood that the sun is actually very much heavier\r\nthan our globe; it is indeed more than three hundred thousand times\r\ngreater in weight. But the sun is about a million three hundred thousand\r\ntimes as big as the earth, and it follows from these figures that its\r\ndensity cannot be more than about a fourth of that of the earth. The\r\nresult is that, at present, the sun is nearly half as heavy again as a\r\nglobe of water the same size. We have used round numbers: the density of\r\nthe sun is actually 1.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.—ARGO AND THE SURROUNDING STARS AND NEBULOSITY.\r\n(_Photographed by Sir David Gill, K.C.B._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following manner we explain how heat is evolved in the\r\ncontraction of the sun. In its early days the sun, or rather the\r\nmaterials which in their aggregate form now constitute the sun, were\r\nspread over an immense tract of space, millions of times greater than\r\nthe present bulk of the sun. We see nebulosities even now in the heavens\r\nwhich may suggest what the primæval nebula may have been before the\r\nevolution had made much progress. Look for instance at Sir David Gill’s\r\nphotograph of the Nebula in Argo in Fig. 17, or at the Trifid Nebula in\r\nFig. 18. We may, indeed, consider the primæval nebula to have been so\r\nvast that particles from the outside falling into the position of the\r\npresent solar surface would acquire that velocity of three hundred and\r\nninety miles a second which we know the attraction of the sun is capable\r\nof producing on an object which has fallen in from an indefinitely great\r\ndistance. As these parts are gradually falling together at the centre,\r\nthere will be an enormous quantity of heat developed from their\r\nconcurrence. Supposing, for instance, that the materials of the sun were\r\narranged in concentric spherical shells around the centre, and imagining\r\nthese shells to be separated by long intervals, so that the whole\r\nmaterial of the sun would be thus diffused over a vast extent, then\r\nevery pound weight in the outermost shell, by the very fact of its\r\nsinking downwards to the present solar system, would acquire a speed of\r\n390 miles a second, and this corresponds to as much energy as could be\r\nproduced by the burning of three tons of coal. But be the fall ever so\r\ngentle, the great law of the conservation of energy tells us that for\r\nthe same descent, however performed, the same quantity of heat must be\r\ngiven out. Each pound in the outer shell would therefore give out as\r\nmuch heat as three tons of coal. Every pound in the other shells, by\r\ngradual descent into the interior, would also render its corresponding\r\ncontribution. It then becomes easily intelligible how, in consequence of\r\nthe original diffusion of the materials of the sun over millions of\r\ntimes its present volume, a vast quantity of energy was available. As\r\nthe sun contracted this energy was turned into radiant heat.\r\n\r\nWe may anticipate a future chapter so far as to assume that there was a\r\ntime when even this solid earth of ours was a nebulous mass diffused\r\nthrough space. We are not concerned as to what the temperature of that\r\nnebulous mass may have been. We may suppose it to be any temperature we\r\nplease. The point that we have now to consider is the quantity of heat\r\nwhich is generated by the contraction of the nebula. That heat is\r\nproduced in the contraction will be plain from what has gone before. But\r\nwe may also demonstrate it in a slightly different way. Let us take any\r\ntwo points in the nebula, P and Q. After the nebula has contracted the\r\npoints which were originally at P and Q will be found at two other\r\npoints, A and B. As the whole nebula in its original form was larger\r\nthan the nebula after it has undergone its contraction, the distance P Q\r\nis generally greater than the distance A B. We may suppose the\r\ncontraction to proceed uniformly, so that the same will be true of the\r\ndistance between any other two particles. The distance between every\r\npair of particles in the contracted nebula will be less than the\r\ndistance between the same particles in the original nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.—TRIFID NEBULA IN SAGITTARIUS\r\n(Lick Observatory, California).\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf two attracting bodies, A and B, are to be moved further apart than\r\nthey were originally, force must be applied and work must be done. We\r\nmay measure the amount of that work in foot-pounds, and then,\r\nremembering that 772 foot-pounds of work are equivalent to the unit of\r\nheat, we may express the energy necessary to force the two particles to\r\na greater distance asunder in the equivalent quantity of heat. If,\r\ntherefore, we had to restore the nebula from the contracted state to the\r\noriginal state, this would involve a forcible enlargement of the\r\ndistance A B between every two particles to its original value, P Q.\r\nWork would be required to do this in every case, and that work might, as\r\nwe have explained, be expressed in terms of its equivalent heat value.\r\nEven though the temperature of the nebula is the same in its contracted\r\nstate as in its original state, we see that a quantity of heat might be\r\nabsorbed or rendered latent in forcing the nebula from one condition to\r\nthe other. In other words, keeping the temperature of the nebula always\r\nconstant, we should have to apply a large quantity of heat to change the\r\nnebula from its contracted form to its expanded form.\r\n\r\nIt is equally true that when the nebula is contracting, and when the\r\ndistance between every two particles is lessening, the nebula must be\r\ngiving out energy, because the total energy in the contracted state is\r\nless than it was in the expanded state. This energy is equivalent to\r\nheat. We need not here pause to consider by what actual process the heat\r\nis manifested; it suffices to say that the heat must, by one of the\r\ngeneral laws of Nature, be produced in some form.\r\n\r\nWe are now able to make a numerical estimate. We shall suppose that the\r\nearth, or rather the materials which make the earth, existed originally\r\nas a large nebula distributed through illimitable space. The\r\ncalculations show that the quantity of heat, generated by the\r\ncondensation of those materials from their nebulous form into the\r\ncondition which the earth now has, was enormously great. We need not\r\nexpress this quantity of heat in ordinary units. The unit we shall take\r\nis one more suited to the other dimensions involved. Let us suppose a\r\nglobe of water as heavy as the earth. This globe would have to be five\r\nor six times as large as the earth. Next let us realise the quantity of\r\nheat that would be required to raise that globe of water from freezing\r\npoint to boiling point. It can be proved that the heat, or its\r\nequivalent, which would be generated merely by the contraction of the\r\nnebula to form the earth, would be ninety times as great as the amount\r\nof heat which would suffice to raise a mass of water equal in weight to\r\nthe earth from freezing point to boiling point.\r\n\r\nWe apply similar calculations to the case of the sun. Let us suppose\r\nthat the great luminary was once diffused as a nebula over an\r\nexceedingly great area of space. It might at first be thought that the\r\nfigures we have just given would answer the question. We might perhaps\r\nconjecture that the quantity of heat would be such as would raise a mass\r\nof water equal to the sun’s mass from freezing to boiling point ninety\r\ntimes over. But we should be very wrong in such a determination. The\r\nheat that is given out by the sun’s contraction is enormously greater\r\nthan this estimate would represent, and we shall be prepared to admit\r\nthis if we reflect on the following circumstances. A stone falling from\r\nan indefinitely great distance to the sun would acquire a speed of 390\r\nmiles a second by the time it reached the sun’s surface. A stone falling\r\nfrom an indefinitely great distance in space to the earth’s surface\r\nwould, however, acquire a speed of not more than seven miles a second.\r\nThe speed acquired by a body falling into the sun by the gravitation of\r\nthe sun is, therefore, fifty-six times as great as the speed acquired by\r\na body falling from infinity to the earth by the gravitation of the\r\nearth. As the energy of a moving body is proportional to the square of\r\nits velocity, we see that the energy with which the falling body would\r\nstrike the sun, and the heat that it might consequently give forth,\r\nwould be about three thousand times as great as the heat which would be\r\nthe result of the fall of that body to the earth. We need not therefore\r\nbe surprised that the drawing together of the elements to form the sun\r\nshould be accompanied by the evolution of a quantity of heat which is\r\nenormously greater than the mere ratio of the masses of the earth and\r\nsun would have suggested.\r\n\r\nThere is another line of reasoning by which we may also illustrate the\r\nsame important principle. Owing to the immense attraction possessed by\r\nthe large mass of the sun, the weights of objects on that luminary would\r\nbe very much greater than the weights of corresponding objects here.\r\nIndeed, a pound on the sun would be found by a spring-balance to weigh\r\nas much as twenty-seven pounds here. If the materials of the sun had to\r\nbe distributed through space, each pound lifted a foot would require\r\ntwenty-seven times the amount of work which would be necessary to lift a\r\npound through a foot on the earth’s surface. It will thus be seen that\r\nnot only the quantity of material that would have to be displaced is\r\nenormously greater in the sun than in the earth, but that the actual\r\nenergy that would have to be applied per unit of mass from the sun would\r\nbe many times as great as the quantity of energy that would have to be\r\napplied per unit of mass from the earth to effect a displacement through\r\nthe same distance. To distribute the sun’s materials into a nebula we\r\nshould therefore require the expenditure of a quantity of work far more\r\nthan proportional to the mere mass of the sun. It follows that when the\r\nsun is contracting the quantity of work that it will give out, or, what\r\ncomes to the same thing, the amount of heat that would be poured forth\r\nin consequence of the contraction per unit of mass of the sun will\r\nlargely exceed the quantity of heat given out in the similar contraction\r\nof the earth per unit of mass of the earth.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will prepare us to accept the result given by\r\naccurate calculation. It has been shown that the heat which would be\r\ngenerated by the condensation of the sun from a nebula filling all space\r\ndown to its present bulk is two hundred and seventy thousand times the\r\namount of heat which would be required to raise the temperature of a\r\nmass of water equal to the sun from freezing point to boiling point.\r\n\r\nThis is a result of a most instructive character. The amount of heat\r\nthat would be required to raise a pound of water from freezing point to\r\nboiling point would, speaking generally, be quite enough if applied to a\r\npound of stone or iron to raise either of these masses to a red heat.\r\nIf, therefore, we think of the sun as a mighty globe of stone or iron,\r\nthe amount of heat that would be produced by the contraction of the sun\r\nfrom the primæval nebula would suffice to raise that globe of stone or\r\niron from freezing point up to a red heat 270,000 times. This will give\r\nus some idea of the stupendous amount of heat which has been placed at\r\nthe disposal of the solar system by the process of contraction of the\r\nsun. This contraction is still going on, and consequently the yield of\r\nheat which is the consequence of this contraction is still in progress,\r\nand the heat given out provides the annual supply necessary for the\r\nsustenance of our solar system.\r\n\r\nThere is one point which should be specially mentioned in connection\r\nwith this argument. We have here supposed that the current supply of\r\nradiant heat from the sun is entirely in virtue of the sun’s\r\ncontraction. That is to say, we suppose the sun’s temperature to be\r\nremaining unaltered. This is perhaps not strictly the case. There may be\r\nreason for believing that the temperature of the sun is increasing,\r\nthough not to an appreciable extent.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to introduce a unit that will be on a scale\r\nadapted to our measurements. Let us think of a globe of coal as heavy as\r\nthe sun. Now suppose adequate oxygen were supplied to burn that coal, a\r\ndefinite quantity of heat would be produced. There is no present\r\nnecessity to evaluate this in the lesser units adapted for other\r\npurposes. In discussing the heat of the sun, we may use what we call the\r\n_coal-unit_, by which is to be understood the total quantity of heat\r\nthat would be produced if a mass of coal equal to the sun in weight were\r\nburned in oxygen. It can be shown by calculations, which will be found\r\nin the Appendix, that in the shrinkage of the sun from an infinitely\r\ngreat extension through space down to its present bulk the contraction\r\nwould develop the stupendous quantity of heat represented by 3,400\r\ncoal-units. It is also shown that one coal unit would be adequate to\r\nsupply the sun’s radiation at its present rate for 2,800 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                        THE HISTORY OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nThe Inconstant Sun—Representation of the Solar System at different\r\n    Epochs—Primæval Density of the Sun—Illustration of Gas in Extreme\r\n    Tenuity—Physical State of the Sun at that Period—The Sun was then a\r\n    Nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE pointed out in the last chapter how, in consequence of its perennial\r\nloss of heat, the orb of day must be undergoing a gradual diminution in\r\nsize. In the present chapter we are to set down the remarkable\r\nconclusions with respect to the early history of the sun to which we\r\nhave been conducted by pursuing to its legitimate consequences the\r\nshrinkage which the sun had undergone in times past.\r\n\r\nThe outer circle in Fig. 19 represents the track in which our earth now\r\nrevolves around the sun, and we are to understand that the radius of\r\nthis circle is about ninety-three million miles. We must imagine that\r\nthe innermost of the four circles represents the position of the sun.\r\nAlong its track the earth revolves year after year; so it has revolved\r\nfor centuries, so it has revolved since the days of the first monarch\r\nthat ever held sway in Britain, so it has revolved during all the time\r\nover which history extends, so it has doubtless revolved for illimitable\r\nperiods anterior to history. For an interval of time that no one\r\npresumes to define with any accuracy the earth has revolved in the same\r\ntrack round that sun in heaven which, during all those ages, has\r\ndispensed its benefits of light and heat for the sustenance of life on\r\nour globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—TO ILLUSTRATE THE HISTORY OF THE SUN.\r\nPresent orbit of Earth.\r\nSun in times very much earlier still.\r\nSun in very early times.\r\nPresent Sun.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun appears constant during those few years in which man is allowed\r\nto strut his little hour. The size of the sun and the lustre of the sun\r\nhas not appreciably altered. But the sun does not always remain the\r\nsame. It has not always shone with the brightness and vigour with which\r\nit shines now; it will not continue for ever to dispense its benefits\r\nwith the same liberality that it does at present. The sun is always in a\r\nstate of change. It would not indeed be correct to refer to these\r\nchanges as growths, in the same sense in which we speak of the growth in\r\na tree. Decade after decade the tree waxes greater; but the sun, as we\r\nhave already explained, does not increase with the time, for the change\r\nindeed lies the other way. It may well be that in this present era the\r\nsun is near its prime, in so far as its capacity to radiate warmth and\r\nbrightness is concerned. It is, however, certain that the sun is not now\r\nso large as it was in ancient days. The diminution of the orb is still\r\nin progress. In these present days of its glorious splendour the orb of\r\nday is much larger than it will be in that gloomy old age which destiny\r\nassigns to it.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown how to give numerical precision to our facts. We\r\nhave stated that the sun’s diameter is diminishing at the rate of one\r\nmile every eleven years. We have dwelt upon the remarkable significance\r\nof that shrinkage in accounting for the sustentation of the sun’s heat.\r\nWe have now to call on this perennial diminution of the sun’s diameter\r\nto provide some information as to the early history of our luminary.\r\n\r\nThe innermost circle in our sketch is to suggest the sun as it is at\r\npresent. Millions of years ago the orb of day was as large as I have\r\nindicated it by the circle with the words “sun in very early times.” It\r\nwill, of course, be understood that we do not make any claim to precise\r\nrepresentation of the magnitude of the orb. At a period much earlier\r\nstill, the sun must have been larger still, and we venture so to depict\r\nit. We know the rate at which the sun is now contracting, and doubtless\r\nthis rate has continued sensibly unaltered during thousands of years,\r\nand indeed we might say scores of thousands of years. But it would not\r\nbe at all safe to assume that the annual rate of change in the sun’s\r\nradius has remained the same throughout excessively remote periods in\r\nits evolutionary history. What we do affirm is, that in the course of\r\nits evolution the sun must have been contracting continually, and we\r\nhave been able to learn the particular rate of contraction\r\ncharacteristic of the present time. But though we are ignorant of the\r\nrate of contraction at very early epochs, yet the sun ever looms larger\r\nand larger in days earlier and still earlier. But in those early days\r\nthe sun was not heavier, was not, indeed, quite so heavy as it is at\r\npresent. For we remember that the sun is perennially adding thousands of\r\ntons to its bulk by the influx of meteors. Perhaps we ought to add that\r\nthe gain of mass from the meteors may be to some extent compensated by\r\nthe loss of substance which the sun not infrequently experiences if, as\r\nis sometimes supposed, it expels in some violent convulsion a mass of\r\nmaterial which takes the form of a comet (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what the density of the sun must have been in those\r\nprimæval days, say, for example, when the luminary had ten times the\r\nvolume that it has at present. Even now, as already stated, it does not\r\nweigh half as much again as a globe of water of the same size, so that\r\nwhen it was ten times as big its density must have been only a small\r\nfraction of that of water. But we may take a stage still earlier. Let us\r\nthink of a time—it was, perhaps, many scores of millions of years\r\nago—when the sun was a thousand times as big as it is at present. The\r\nsame quantity of matter which now constitutes the sun was then expanded\r\nover a volume a thousand times greater. A remarkable conclusion follows\r\nfrom this consideration. The air that we breathe has a density which is\r\nabout the seven-hundredth part of that of water. Hence we see that at\r\nthe time when the materials of the sun were expanded into a volume a\r\nthousand times as great as it is at present the density of the luminary\r\nmust have been about equal to that of ordinary air. We refer, of course,\r\nin such statements to the average density of the sun. It will be\r\nremembered that the density of the sun cannot be uniform. The mutual\r\nattractions and pressures of the particles in the interior must make the\r\ndensity greater the nearer we approach to the centre.\r\n\r\nWe must push our argument further still. We have ascertained that the\r\nprimæval sun could not have been a dense solid body like a ball of\r\nmetal. It must have been more nearly represented by a ball of gas. There\r\nwas a time when that collection of matter which now constitutes the sun\r\nwas so big that a balloon of equal size, filled at ordinary pressure\r\nwith the lightest of known gases, would contain within it a heavier\r\nweight than the sun. At this early period the sun must have been as\r\nlight as an equal volume of hydrogen. The reasoning which has conducted\r\nus to this point remains still unimpaired. From that early period we may\r\ntherefore look back to periods earlier still. We see that the sun must\r\nhave been ever larger and larger, for the same quantity of material must\r\nhave been ever more and more diffused. There was a time when the mean\r\ndensity of the sun must have been far less than that of the gas in any\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nWe must not pause to consider intermediate stages. We shall look back at\r\nonce to an excessively early period when the sun—or perhaps we ought\r\nrather to say the matter which in a more condensed form now constitutes\r\nthe sun—was expanded throughout the volume of a globe whose radius was\r\nas great as the present distance from the sun to the earth. Have we not\r\nhere truly an astonishing result, deduced as a necessary consequence\r\nfrom the fundamental laws of heat?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—THE SOLAR CORONA (January 1st, 1899).\r\n(_Photographed during Eclipse by Professor W. H. Pickering._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that the sun at that early date did not at all\r\nresemble the glorious orb to which we owe our very existence. The\r\nprimæval sun must have been a totally different object, as we can easily\r\nimagine if we try to think that the sun’s materials then filled a volume\r\ntwelve million times as great as they occupy at present. Instead of\r\ncomparing such an object with the gases in our ordinary atmosphere, it\r\nshould rather be likened to the residue left in an exhausted receiver\r\nafter the resources of chemistry have been taxed to make as near an\r\napproach as possible to a perfect vacuum.\r\n\r\nWe can give a familiar illustration of gas in a state of extreme\r\ntenuity. Look at the beautiful incandescent light with which in these\r\ndays our buildings are illuminated. How brilliantly those little globes\r\nshine! The globe has to be most carefully sealed against the outside\r\nair. If there were the smallest opportunity for access, the air from\r\noutside would rush in and the lamp would be destroyed. In the\r\npreparation of such a lamp elaborate precautions have to be taken to\r\nsecure that the exhaustion of the air from the little globe shall be as\r\nnearly perfect as possible. Of course it is impossible to remove all the\r\nair. No known processes can produce a perfect vacuum. Some traces of gas\r\nwould remain after the air-pump had been applied even for hours.\r\n\r\nWe must now imagine a globe, not merely two inches in diameter like one\r\nof these little lamps, but a globe 186,000,000 miles in diameter, a\r\nglobe so large that the earth’s orbit would just form a girdle round it.\r\nEven if this globe had been exhausted, so that its density was only the\r\ntwelve-thousandth part of the ordinary atmospheric density, it would\r\nstill contain more material than is found in the sun in heaven. Thus our\r\nreasoning has conducted us to the notion of an epoch when the sun—or\r\nrather I should say the matter composing the sun—formed something\r\ntotally different from the orb which we know so well. The matter in that\r\nvery diffuse state would not dispense light and heat as a sun in the\r\nsense in which we understand the word. However vast might be the store\r\nof energy which it contained—a store indeed thousands of times greater\r\nthan our present sun possesses—yet it would hardly be possessed of the\r\npower of effective radiation. It would assuredly not be able to warm and\r\nlight a world associated with it, in the same way as the sun now\r\nprovides so gloriously for our wants and comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—THE GREAT COMET OF 1882.\r\n(_Photographed on November 7th, 1882, by Sir David Gill, K.C.B._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is certain that in those early days there was no earth to be\r\nwarmed and lighted. Our globe, even if it can be said to have existed at\r\nall, was truly “without form and void.” At the time when the sun was\r\nswollen into a great globe of gas or rarefied matter, the elementary\r\nsubstances which were to form the future earth were in a condition\r\nutterly different from that of our present globe. The history of this\r\nearth itself involves another chapter of the argument. Let it suffice to\r\nnotice, for the present, that our reasoning has led us to a time when\r\nthe sun consisted only of a rarefied gaseous material, and let us give\r\nto the matter in this condition the name which astronomers apply to any\r\nobject of a similar character wherever they may meet with it in the\r\nuniverse. Suppose that we could observe through our telescopes at the\r\npresent moment an object in remote space which was like what the sun\r\nmust have been at that early stage of its existence which we have been\r\nconsidering, I do not think that the object would be unfamiliar to\r\nastronomers. There is, indeed, no doubt that there are many objects\r\nvisible at this moment, and nightly studied in our observatories, which\r\nare formed of matter just in the same state as the sun was in those\r\nearly times. Examined with a good telescope, the object would seem like\r\na small stain of light on the black background of the sky. The observer\r\nwould at once call it a nebula. In these modern days he would probably\r\napply the spectroscope to it, and this instrument would assure him that\r\nthe object he was looking at was a mass of incandescent gas. Such an\r\nobject would in all probability not greatly differ from many nebulæ now\r\nknown to us.\r\n\r\nThis being so, why should we withhold from the sun of primitive days the\r\ndesignation to which it seems to be so fully entitled? Why should we not\r\nspeak of it as a nebula? The application of the laws of heat has shown\r\nthat the great orb of day was once one of those numerous objects which\r\nastronomers know as nebulæ, and perhaps it may not be too fanciful to\r\nsuppose that a trace of the primæval nebula still survives in what we\r\ncall the Solar Corona (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                         THE EARTH’S BEGINNING.\r\n\r\nThe Earth to be Studied—A great Experiment—The Diamond Drill—A Boring\r\n    upwards of a Mile Deep—A Mechanical Feat—The Scientific Importance\r\n    of the Work—Increase of Temperature with the Depth—A special Form of\r\n    Thermometer—Taking the Temperature in the Boring—The Level of\r\n    Constant Temperature—The Rate of Increase of Temperature with the\r\n    Depth—One degree Fahrenheit for every Sixty-six Feet in\r\n    Depth—Temperatures at Depths above a Mile—Conclusions as to the Heat\r\n    at very great Depths—The Heat developed by Tidal Action—This will\r\n    not account for the Earth’s Internal Heat—The Earth must be\r\n    continually Cooling—Inferences from the incessant loss of Heat from\r\n    the Earth—The Earth’s Surface once Red-Hot, or Molten—The Earth must\r\n    have originated from a Nebula—The Earth’s Beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the last chapter we endeavoured to ascertain what can be learned from\r\nthe radiation of the sun with regard to the history of the solar system.\r\nIn this chapter we shall not consider any body in the heavens, but the\r\ncondition of the earth itself. We have learned something of the history\r\nof the solar system from the celestial bodies; we shall now learn\r\nsomething about it in another way—from the condition of our globe at\r\ndepths far beneath our feet.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to commence by mentioning a remarkable experiment\r\nwhich was made a few years ago. Though that experiment is of great\r\nscientific interest, yet it was not designed with any scientific object\r\nin view. Not less than £10,000 was expended on the enterprise, and\r\nprobably so large a sum has never been expended on a single experiment\r\nof which the sole object was to add to scientific knowledge. In the\r\npresent case the immediate object in view was, of course, a commercial\r\none. There was, it may be presumed, reasonable expectation that the\r\ngreat initial cost, and a handsome profit as well, would be returned as\r\nthe fruits of the enterprise. Whether the great experiment was\r\nsuccessful from the money-making point of view does not now concern us,\r\nbut it does concern us to know that the experiment was very successful\r\nin the sense that it incidentally afforded scientific information of the\r\nvery highest value.\r\n\r\nThe experiment in question was made in Germany, at Schladebach, about\r\nfifteen miles from Leipzig. It was undertaken in making a search for\r\ncoal. Some enterprising capitalists consulted the geologists as to\r\nwhether coal-seams were likely to be found in this locality. They were\r\nassured that coal was there, though it must certainly be a very long way\r\ndown, and consequently the pit by which alone the seams could be worked\r\nwould have to be unusually deep. The capitalists were not daunted by\r\nthis consideration. But, before incurring the great expense of sinking\r\nthe shaft, they determined to make a preliminary search and verily the\r\nactual presence of workable seams of useful fuel. They determined to\r\nbore a hole down through the rocks deep enough to reach the coal, if it\r\ncould be reached. A boring for coal was, of course, by no means a\r\nnovelty; but there was an unprecedented degree of mechanical skill and\r\nscientific acumen shown in this memorable boring near Leipzig. The\r\nresult of this enterprise was to make the deepest hole which, with\r\nperhaps a single more recent exception not of so much scientific\r\ninterest, has ever been pierced through the crust of the earth. This\r\nboring was merely a preliminary to the operations which would follow if\r\nthe experiment were successful in discovering coal. It was accordingly\r\nonly necessary to make a hole large enough to allow specimens of the\r\nstrata to be brought to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe instrument employed in sinking a hole of such a phenomenal depth\r\nthrough solid rock is characteristic of modern enterprise. The boring\r\ntool had a cutting edge of diamonds: for no other cutting implement is\r\nat once hard enough and durable enough to advance steadily, yard by\r\nyard, through the various rocks and minerals that are met with in the\r\ndescent through the earth’s crust. We might, perhaps, illustrate the\r\nactual form of the tool as follows: imagine a piece of iron pipe, about\r\nsix inches in diameter, cut squarely across, with diamonds inserted\r\nround its circular end, and we have a notion of the diamond drill. If\r\nthe drill be made to revolve when held vertically, with the diamonds in\r\ncontact with the rocks, the cutting will commence. As the rotation is\r\ncontinued, the drill advances through the rocks, and a solid core of the\r\nmaterial will occupy the hollow of the pipe. We do not now enter into\r\nany description of the many mechanical details; there are ingenious\r\ncontrivances for removing the _débris_ produced by the attrition of the\r\nrocks as the diamonds cut their way, and provision is also made for\r\ncarefully raising the valuable core which, as it provides specimens of\r\nthe different strata pierced, will show the coal, if coal is ever\r\nreached. There is, of course, an arrangement by which, as the first\r\nlength of drill becomes buried, successive lengths can be added, so as\r\nto transmit the motion to the cutting edge and enable the tool to be\r\nraised when necessary; in this manner one length of solid rock after\r\nanother is brought up for examination. These cores, when ranged in\r\nseries, give to the miner the information he requires as to the\r\ndifferent beds of rock through which the instrument has pierced in its\r\ndescent and as to the depths of the beds. A series of cores will\r\nsometimes show astonishing variety in the material through which the\r\ndrill has passed. Here the tool will be seen passing through a bed of\r\nhard limestone, and then entering a bed of soft shale; now the tool\r\nbores through dense and hard masses of greenstone, anon it pierces, it\r\nmay be, a stratum of white marble; and finally the explorer may hope to\r\nfind his expectations realised by the arrival at the surface of a\r\ncylinder of solid coal.\r\n\r\nThe famous boring to which we are now referring, though very deep, was\r\nnot large in diameter. As it descended the comparatively large tool\r\nfirst employed was replaced by a succession of smaller tools, so that\r\nthe hole gradually tapered from the surface to the lowest point. At its\r\ngreatest depth the hole was indeed hardly larger than a man’s little\r\nfinger. It increased gradually all the way to the surface, where it was\r\nlarge enough for a man’s arm to enter it easily.\r\n\r\nHow often do we find that the success which rewards mechanical\r\nenterprise greatly transcends even the most sanguine estimate previously\r\nformed! Without the actual experience which has been acquired, I do not\r\nthink anyone could have anticipated the extraordinary facilities which\r\nthe diamond drill has given in the operations of a deep boring. This\r\nhole at Schladebach was, indeed, a wonderful success. It pierced deeper\r\nthan any previous excavation, deeper than any well, deeper than any coal\r\npit. From the surface of the ground, where the hole was some six inches\r\nin diameter, down to the lowest point, where it was only as large as a\r\nlittle finger, the vertical depth was not less than one mile and a\r\nhundred and seventeen yards.\r\n\r\nIt is worth pondering for a moment on the extraordinary mechanical feat\r\nwhich this represents. When the greatest depth was reached, the total\r\nlength of the series of boring rods from the surface where the machinery\r\nwas engaged in rotating the tool down to the cutting diamonds at the\r\nlower end where the penetration was being effected, was as long as from\r\nPiccadilly Circus to the top of Portland Place. If a hole of equal\r\nlength had been bored downwards from the top of Ben Nevis, it would have\r\nreached the sea level and gone down 1,200 feet lower still. When the\r\nforeman in charge wished to look at the tool to see whether it was\r\nworking satisfactorily, or whether any of the diamonds had got injured\r\nor displaced, it was necessary to raise that tremendous series of rods.\r\nEach one of them had to be lifted, had to be uncoupled, and had to be\r\nlaid aside. I need hardly say that such an operation was a very tedious\r\none. The collective weight of the working system of rods was about\r\ntwenty tons, and not less than ten hours’ hard work was required before\r\nthe tool was raised from the bottom to the surface. We may, I believe,\r\nconclude that so much ingenuity and so much trouble was never before\r\nexpended on the act of boring a hole; but the results are full of\r\ninformation on important problems of science.\r\n\r\nI am not going to speak of the geological results of this exploration.\r\nThere is not the least doubt that the remarkable section of the earth’s\r\ncrust thus obtained is of much interest to geologists. Our object in now\r\nalluding to this wonderful boring is, however, very different. Its\r\nsignificance will be realised when we say that it gives us more full and\r\ndefinite information about the internal heat of the earth than had ever\r\nbeen obtained by any other experiment on the earth’s crust. No doubt\r\nmany previous observations of the internal heat of the globe were well\r\nknown to the investigators who feel an interest in these important\r\nquestions; but the exceptional depth of this boring, as well as the\r\nexceptionally favourable conditions under which it was made, have\r\nrendered the information derived from it of the utmost value to science.\r\n\r\nWe ought first to record our special obligation to the German engineer,\r\nCaptain Huyssen, who bored this wonderful hole. He was not only a highly\r\nskilful mining engineer, diligent in the pursuit of his profession, but,\r\nby the valuable scientific work he has done, he has shown himself to be\r\none of those cultivated and thoughtful students who love to avail\r\nthemselves of every opportunity of searching into Nature’s secrets. Our\r\nthanks are due to him for the remarkable zeal with which he utilised the\r\nexceptional opportunities for valuable scientific work that arose,\r\nincidentally as it were, in connection with the work committed to him.\r\n\r\nOf course, everybody knows that the temperature of the earth is found to\r\nincrease gradually as greater depths are reached. The rate at which the\r\nincrease takes place has been determined on many occasions. But when\r\nopportunities have arisen for taking the temperature at considerable\r\ndepths below the earth’s surface, it has happened sometimes that the\r\nobservations have been complicated by circumstances which deprived them\r\nof a good deal of their accuracy. If our object be to learn the law\r\nconnecting the earth’s temperature with the depth below the surface, it\r\nis not sufficient to study the thermometric readings in different coal\r\npits. Throughout the workings in every pit there must be arrangements\r\nfor ventilation. The cool air has to be drawn down, and thus the\r\ntemperature indicated in the pit is forced below the temperature which\r\nwould really be found at that depth if external sources of change of\r\ntemperature were absent.\r\n\r\nCaptain Huyssen rightly deemed that the hole which he had pierced\r\npresented exceptional opportunities for the study of the important\r\nquestion of the earth’s internal temperature. Precautions had, of\r\ncourse, to be observed. The hole, as might be expected, was filled with\r\nwater, and the water would tend, if its circulation were permitted, to\r\nequalise the temperature at different depths. But the ingenious Captain\r\nquickly found an efficient remedy for this source of inaccuracy. He\r\ndevised an arrangement, which I must not delay to describe, by which he\r\ncould place temporary plugs in the hole at any depths he might desire;\r\nhe then determined the temperature of the water in a short length, so\r\nplugged above and below that the circulation was stopped, and\r\naccordingly the water thus confined might be relied on to indicate the\r\ntemperatures of the strata which hold it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—SPECIAL THERMOMETER FOR USE IN DEEP BORINGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thermometer employed in an investigation of this sort is ingenious\r\nthough extremely simple. The ordinary maximum thermometer is not found\r\nto be adapted for the purpose. The instrument (Fig. 22) employed in the\r\ndetermination of underground temperatures is very much less complicated\r\nand at the same time much more accurate. The contrivance is indeed so\r\nworthy of notice that I do not like to pass it by without a few words.\r\nThe thermometer with which the temperature of the earth is ascertained\r\nin such investigations is not like any ordinary thermometer. There is no\r\nscale of degrees attached to it or engraved upon it, as we generally\r\nfind in such instruments. The instrument with which the temperature of\r\nthe deep hole was measured was merely a bulb of glass with a slender\r\ncapillary stem, the end of which was not closed. When it was about to be\r\nlowered to test the temperature of the rocks at the lowest point to\r\nwhich the drill had penetrated, the bulb and the tube were first filled\r\nwith mercury to the top, and brimming over. This simple apparatus was\r\nattached to a long wire, by the aid of which it could be lowered down\r\nthis deep hole. Down it went till at last the thermometer reached the\r\nbottom, which, as we have explained, it could not do until more than a\r\nmile of wire had been paid out. The instrument was then left quietly\r\nuntil it presently assumed the same temperature as the rocks about it.\r\nThere could be no interference by heat from other strata, as the\r\ncirculation of water was prevented by the plugging already referred to.\r\nThe temperature to which the thermometer had been exposed must,\r\ntherefore, have been precisely the temperature corresponding in that\r\nparticular locality to that particular depth below the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nAs the thermometer descended, it passed through a succession of strata\r\nof ever-increasing temperature. Consequently the mercury, which, it will\r\nbe remembered, had completely filled the instrument when it was at the\r\nsurface, began to expand according as it was exposed to greater\r\ntemperatures. As the mercury expanded, it must, of course, flow out of\r\nthe tube and be lost, because the tube had been already full. So long as\r\nthe mercury was gaining in temperature, more and more of it escaped from\r\nthe top of the tube, and the flow only ceased when the instrument was\r\nresting at the bottom of the hole, and the mercury became as hot as the\r\nsurrounding rocks. No more mercury was then expelled, the tube, however,\r\nremaining full to the brim. After allowing a sufficient time for the\r\ntemperature to settle definitely, the thermometer was raised to the\r\nsurface. As it ascended through the long bore the temperature\r\nsurrounding it steadily declined. With the fall in the temperature of\r\nthe mercury the volume of that liquid began to shrink; but the mercury\r\nalready expelled could not be recalled. When at last the instrument had\r\nsafely reached the surface, after its long journey down and up, and when\r\nthe mercury had regained the temperature of the air, the lessened\r\nquantity that remained told the tale of the changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is now easy to see how, even in the absence of an engraved scale on\r\nthe instrument, it is possible to determine, from the amount of mercury\r\nremaining, the temperature to which the thermometer has been subjected\r\nat the bottom of the boring. It is only necessary to place this\r\nthermometer in a basin of cold water, and then gradually increase the\r\ntemperature by adding hot water. As the temperature increases the\r\nmercury will, of course, rise, and the hotter the water the more nearly\r\nwill the mercury approach the top of the tube. At last, when the mercury\r\nhas just reached the top of the tube, and when it is just on the point\r\nof overflowing, we may feel certain that the temperature of the water in\r\nthe basin has been raised to the same temperature as that to which the\r\ninstrument was subjected at the bottom of the boring. In each case the\r\ntemperature is just sufficient to expand the quantity of mercury\r\nremaining in the instrument so as to make it fill precisely both bulb\r\nand stem. When this critical condition is reached, it only remains to\r\ndip a standard thermometer, furnished with the ordinary graduation, into\r\nthe hot water of the basin. Thus we learn the temperature of the basin,\r\nthus we learn the temperature of the mercury in the thermometer, and\r\nthus we determine the temperature at the bottom of the boring over a\r\nmile deep.\r\n\r\nI need not specify the details of the arrangements which enabled the\r\nskilful engineer also to determine the temperature at various points of\r\nthe hole intermediate between the top and the bottom. In fact, taking\r\nevery precaution to secure accuracy, he made measurements of the\r\ntemperature at a succession of points about a hundred feet distant\r\nthroughout the whole depth. In each case he was careful, as I have\r\nalready indicated, to plug the hole above and below the thermometer, so\r\nas to prevent the circulation of water in the vicinity of the\r\ninstrument. The thermometer, therefore, recorded the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding rocks without any disturbing element. Fifty-eight\r\nmeasurements at equal distances from the surface to the greatest depths\r\nwere thus obtained.\r\n\r\nWe have now to discuss the instructive results to which we have been\r\nconducted by this remarkable series of measurements. First let us notice\r\nthat there is much less variation in the subterranean temperatures than\r\nin the temperatures on the earth’s surface. On the surface of the earth\r\nwe are accustomed to large fluctuations of temperature. We have, of\r\ncourse, the diurnal fluctuations in temperature from day to night; we\r\nhave also the great seasonal fluctuations between summer and winter. But\r\nbelow a certain depth in the ground the temperature becomes much more\r\nequable. Whether the temperature on the surface be high or whether it be\r\nlow, the temperature of any particular point far beneath the surface\r\ndoes not change to any appreciable extent. In Arctic regions the surface\r\nof the earth may undergo violent seasonal changes of temperature, while\r\nat a few feet below the surface the temperature, from one end of the\r\nyear to the other, may remain sensibly unaltered.\r\n\r\nIn deep and extensive caverns the temperature is sometimes found to\r\nremain practically unaffected by the changes in the seasons. The Mammoth\r\nCave of Kentucky is a notable instance. The uniformity of the\r\ntemperature, as well as the mildness and dryness of the air, in those\r\nwonderful subterranean vaults is such that many years ago a project was\r\nformed to utilise the cavern as an abode for consumptive patients, for\r\nwhose cure, according to the belief then prevailing, an equable\r\ntemperature was above all things to be desired. Houses were indeed\r\nactually built on the sandy floors of the cavern, and I believe they\r\nwere for some time tenanted by consumptive patients willing to try this\r\ndesperate remedy. The temperature may have been uniform and the air may\r\nhave been dry, but the intolerable gloom of such a residence entirely\r\nneutralised any beneficial effects that might otherwise have accrued.\r\nThe ruins of the houses still remain to testify to the failure of the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe heat received from the sun does not penetrate far into the earth’s\r\ncrust, and consequently the diurnal and even the seasonal changes of the\r\ntemperature at the surface produce less and less effect with every\r\nincrease of the depth. All such variations of temperature are confined\r\nto within 100 feet of the surface. At the depth of about 100 feet a\r\nfixed temperature of 52° Fahrenheit is reached, and this is true all\r\nover the earth. It matters not whether the surface be hot or cold,\r\nwhether the latitude is tropical and the season is midsummer, whether\r\nthe latitude lie in the Arctic regions and the season be the awful\r\nwinter of iron-bound frost and total absence of sun—in all cases we find\r\nthat about 100 feet below the surface the temperature is 52°. With\r\nsufficient accuracy we may say that this depth expresses the limit of\r\nthe penetration of the earth’s crust by sunbeams. The remarkable law\r\naccording to which the temperature changes below the depth of 100 feet\r\nis wholly irrespective of the solar radiation.\r\n\r\nThe study of the internal heat of the earth may be said to begin below\r\nthe level of 100 feet, and the results that were obtained in the great\r\nboring are extremely accordant. The deeper the hole, the hotter the\r\nrocks; and Captain Huyssen found that for each sixty-six feet in descent\r\nthe temperature increased one degree Fahrenheit. To illustrate the\r\nactual observations, let us take two particular cases. We have said that\r\nthe hole was one mile and 117 yards deep. Let us first suppose the\r\nthermometer to be lowered 117 yards and then raised, after a due\r\nobservance of the precautions required to obtain an accurate result. The\r\ntemperature of the rocks at the depth of 117 yards is thus ascertained.\r\nIn the next observation let the thermometer be lowered from the surface\r\nto the bottom of the hole, that is to say, exactly one mile below the\r\nposition which it occupied in the former experiment. The observations\r\nindicate a temperature 80° Fahrenheit higher in the latter case than in\r\nthe former. We have thus ascertained a most important fact. We have\r\nshown that the temperature of the crust of the earth at the depth of one\r\nmile increases about 80°. This is at the rate of one degree every\r\nsixty-six feet. I should just add, as a caution, that if we choose to\r\nsay the temperature increases one degree per sixty-six feet of descent,\r\nwe ought to suppose that we start from a point which is not higher than\r\nthat level of 100 feet above which as already explained, the temperature\r\nof the rocks is more or less affected by solar heat.\r\n\r\nWe have described these particular observations in some detail because\r\nthey have been conducted under conditions far more favourable to\r\naccuracy than have ever been available in any previous investigations of\r\nthe same kind. But now we shall omit further reference to this\r\nparticular undertaking near Leipzig. It is not alone in that particular\r\nlocality, not alone in Germany, not alone in Europe, not alone on the\r\nsurface of any continent, that this statement may be made. The statement\r\nis one universally true so far as our whole earth is concerned. Wherever\r\nwe bore a hole through the earth’s crust, whether that hole be made in\r\nthe desert of Sahara or through the icebound coasts of Greenland, we\r\nshould find the general rule to obtain, that there is an increase of\r\ntemperature of about 80° for a mile of descent. This is true in every\r\ncontinent, it is true in every island; and, though we cannot here go\r\ninto the evidence fully, there is not the least doubt that it is true\r\nalso under the floor of ocean. If beneath the bed of the Atlantic a hole\r\na mile deep were pierced, the temperature of the rocks at the bottom of\r\nthat hole would, it is believed, exceed by about 80° the temperature of\r\nthe rocks at the surface where the hole had its origin. We learn that at\r\nthe depth of a mile the temperature of the earth must generally be 80°\r\nhotter than it is at the level of constant temperature near the surface.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps help us to realise the significance of this statement if\r\nwe think of the following illustration. Let us imagine that the waters\r\nof the ocean were removed from the earth. The ocean may in places be\r\nfive or six miles deep, but that is quite an inconsiderable quantity\r\nwhen compared with the diameter of the earth. The change in the size of\r\nthe earth by the removal of all the water would not be greater,\r\nproportionally, than the change produced in a wet football by simply\r\nwiping it dry. Let us suppose that an outer layer of the earth’s\r\nsurface, a mile in thickness, was then to be peeled off. If we remember\r\nthat the diameter of the earth is 8,000 miles, we shall see that this\r\nouter layer, whose removal we have supposed, does not bear to the whole\r\nextent of the earth a ratio even as great as that which the skin of a\r\npeach does to the fruit inside. But this much is certain, that if the\r\nearth were so peeled there would be a wonderful difference in its\r\nnature. For though practically of the same size as it is at present, it\r\nwould be so hot that it would be impossible to live upon it.\r\n\r\nNext comes the very interesting question as to the temperature that\r\nwould be found at the bottom of a hole deeper still than that we have\r\nbeen considering. Our curiosity as to the depths of the earth extends\r\nmuch below the point to which Captain Huyssen drove down his diamond\r\ndrill. The trouble and the cost of still deeper exploration of the same\r\nkind seem, however, to be actually prohibitive. To bore a hole two miles\r\ndeep would certainly cost a great deal more than twice the sum which\r\nsufficed to bore a hole one mile deep. At a great depth each further\r\nfoot could only be won with not less difficulty and expense than a\r\ndozen, or many dozen feet, at the surface. Mining enterprise does not at\r\npresent seem to contemplate actual workings at depths much over a mile,\r\nso there does not seem much chance of any very much deeper boring being\r\nattempted. We do not say that a hole two miles deep would be actually\r\nimpossible; it may well be wished that some millionaire could be induced\r\nto try the experiment. We should greatly like to be able to lower a\r\nthermometer down to a depth of two miles through the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nSeeing there is but little chance of our wish for such future\r\nexperiments being gratified, it is consolatory to find that actual\r\nobservations of this kind are not indispensable to the argument on which\r\nwe are to enter. Our argument can indeed be conducted a stage further,\r\neven with our present information. The indications already obtained in\r\nthe hole one mile deep go a long way towards proving what the\r\ntemperature of a hole still deeper would be. We have already remarked\r\nthat it was part of Captain Huyssen’s scheme to obtain careful readings\r\nof his thermometer at intervals of 100 feet from the surface to the\r\nbottom of the hole. A study of these readings shows that the increase of\r\n80° in a mile takes place uniformly at the rate of one degree for each\r\nsixty-six feet of depth. As the temperature increases uniformly from the\r\nsurface down to the lowest point which our thermometers have reached, it\r\nwould be unreasonable to suppose that the rate of increase would be\r\nfound to suffer some abrupt change if it were possible to go a little\r\ndeeper. As the temperature rises 80° in the first mile, and as the rate\r\nof increase is shown by the observations to be quite as large at the\r\nbottom of the hole as it is at the top, we certainly shall not make any\r\nvery great mistake if we venture to assume that in the second mile the\r\ntemperature would also increase to an extent which will not be far from\r\n80°. This inference from the observations leads to the remarkable\r\nconclusion that at a depth of two miles the temperature of the earth\r\nmust be, we will not say exactly, but at all events not very far from,\r\n160° higher than at the level of constant temperature about 100 feet\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAs in the former case, we need not confine ourselves to any particular\r\nlocality in drawing this conclusion. The arguments apply not only to the\r\nrocks underneath Leipzig, but to the rocks over every part of the globe,\r\nwhether on continents or islands, or even if forming the base of an\r\nocean. No one denies that the law of increase in temperature with the\r\ndepth must submit to some variation in accordance with local\r\ncircumstances. In essential features it may, however, be conceded that\r\nthe law is the same over all the earth. If we take 52° to be the\r\ntemperature of the level 100 feet down, which limits the seasonal\r\nvariations, and if we add that at two miles further down the temperature\r\nis somewhere about 160° more, we come to the conclusion that at a depth\r\nof a little over two miles the temperature of the rocks forming the\r\nearth’s crust is about 212° Fahrenheit. Thus we draw the important\r\ninference that if, the oceans having been removed, we were then to\r\nremove from the earth’s surface a rind two miles thick—a thickness\r\nwhich, it is to be observed, is only the two-thousandth part of the\r\nearth’s radius—we should transform the earth into a globe which, while\r\nit still retained appreciably the same size, would have such a\r\ntemperature that even the coolest spot would be as hot as boiling water.\r\nThis is indeed a remarkable result.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we have gone so far, it is impossible for us to resist\r\nmaking a further attempt to determine what the temperature of the\r\nearth’s crust must be if we could send a thermometer still lower. A hole\r\none mile deep we have seen; I do not think we can hope to see a hole two\r\nmiles deep, but still it may not be absolutely impracticable; but a hole\r\nof three or more miles deep we may safely regard as transcending present\r\npossibilities in engineering enterprise. Are we therefore to be deprived\r\nof all information as to the condition of our earth at depths exceeding\r\nthose already considered? Fortunately we can learn something. We are\r\nassisted by certain laws of heat, and, though the evidence on which we\r\nbelieve those laws is necessarily limited to the experience of Nature as\r\nit comes within our observation, yet it is impossible to refuse assent\r\nto the belief that the same laws will regulate the transmission of heat\r\nin the crust of the earth two miles, three miles, or many miles beneath\r\nour feet.\r\n\r\nI represent, in the diagram shown in Fig. 23, three consecutive beds of\r\nrock—A, B, and C—as they lie in the earth’s crust, a little more than a\r\nmile beneath our feet. I shall suppose that the bed B is the very lowest\r\nrock whose temperature was determined in the great boring. The drill has\r\npassed completely through A, it has pierced to the middle of B, but it\r\nhas not entered C. The observations have shown that the temperature of\r\nthe stratum B exceeds that of the stratum A, and we further note that\r\nthis is a permanent condition—that is to say, B constantly remains\r\nhotter than A. From this fact alone we can learn something as regards\r\nthe temperature of the stratum C which lies in contact with B. Of course\r\nwe are unable to observe the temperature of C directly, because by\r\nhypothesis the boring tool has not entered that rock. We can, however,\r\nprove, from the laws of the conduction of heat, that the temperature of\r\nC must be greater than that of B; and this appears from the following\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT BORE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is plain that C must be either just the same temperature as B, or it\r\nmust be hotter than B, or it must be colder than B. If C were the same\r\ntemperature as B, then the law of conduction of heat tells us that no\r\nheat would flow from one of these strata to the other. The laws of heat,\r\nhowever, assure us that when two bodies at different temperatures are in\r\ncontact the heat will flow from the hotter of these bodies into the\r\ncolder, so long as the inequality of temperature is maintained. As B is\r\nhotter than A, then heat must necessarily flow from B into A, and this\r\nflow must tend to equalise the temperature in these strata, for B is\r\nlosing heat while none is flowing into it from C. Therefore B and A\r\ncould not continue to preserve indefinitely the different temperatures\r\nwhich observation shows them to do. We are therefore forced to the\r\nconclusion that B and C cannot be at the same temperature.\r\n\r\nNext let us suppose that the temperature of the stratum B exceeded that\r\nof C. Then, as A is colder than B, it appears that B would be lying\r\nbetween two strata each having a temperature lower than itself. But\r\nthat, of course, cannot be a permanent arrangement, for the heat would\r\nthen escape from B on both sides. The laws of heat, therefore, tell us\r\nthat B could not possibly retain permanently a temperature above both A\r\nand C. Observation, however, shows that the temperatures of A and B are\r\npersistently unequal. We are therefore obliged to reject the supposition\r\nthat the temperature of C can be less than that of B.\r\n\r\nWe have thus demonstrated that the temperature of the stratum C cannot\r\nbe the same as that of B. We have also demonstrated that it cannot be\r\ncolder than B. We must therefore believe that C is hotter than B. This\r\nproves that the stratum immediately beneath that stratum to which the\r\nobservations have extended must be hotter than it. Thus, though the\r\nstratum below the bottom of the hole lies beyond the reach of our actual\r\nobservation, we have, nevertheless, been able to learn something with\r\nregard to its temperature.\r\n\r\nHaving established this much, we can continue the same argument further;\r\nindeed, it would seem that we can continue it indefinitely, so long as\r\nthere is a succession of such strata. Underneath the stratum C must lie\r\nanother stratum D. But we have shown that C must be hotter than B, and\r\nprecisely the same argument that has proved this will prove that D is\r\nhotter than C. Underneath D comes the stratum E, and again the same\r\nargument will apply. Inasmuch as D is hotter than C, it follows that E\r\nmust be hotter than D. These three strata, C, D, and E, are all beyond\r\nthe reach of the thermometer, we know nothing of their temperatures by\r\ndirect observation; but none the less is the argument, which we are\r\nfollowing strictly, applicable. Thus we obtain the important result that\r\nin the crust of the earth the temperature must be always greater, the\r\ngreater the depth beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the rate of increase of temperature with the depth is\r\nabout 80° for the first mile, and we deem it probable that the rate of\r\nincrease may be maintained at about the same for the second mile. But we\r\ndo not suppose that the rate of increase mile after mile will remain the\r\nsame at extremely great depths. It may perhaps be presumed that there\r\nmust be some increase of temperature all the way to the earth’s centre;\r\nbut the rate of increase per mile may change as the centre is\r\napproached. The point of importance for our present argument is, that\r\nthe temperature of the earth must increase with the depth, though the\r\nrate of increase is quite unknown to us at depths greatly beyond those\r\nwhich the thermometer has reached. It is easy to see that the conditions\r\nprevailing in the earth’s interior might greatly modify any conclusion\r\nwe should draw from observations near the surface. Our argument has been\r\nbased on the laws of heat, as we find them existing in matter on the\r\nsurface of the earth submitted to such ranges of different physical\r\nconditions as can be dealt with in our laboratories; but at such\r\nexcessively high temperatures as may exist in the earth’s interior the\r\nproperties of matter may be widely different from the properties of\r\nmatter as known to us within the temperatures that we are able to\r\nproduce and control. The enormous pressure to which matter in the\r\ninterior of the earth must be subjected should also be mentioned in this\r\nconnection. It is wholly impossible to produce pressures by any\r\nmechanical artifice which even distantly approach in intensity to that\r\nawful force to which matter is subjected in the earth’s interior.\r\n\r\nIt may be instructive to consider a few facts with respect to this\r\nquestion of pressure in the earth’s interior. A column of water 34½ feet\r\nhigh gives, as everybody knows, a pressure of fifteen pounds on the\r\nsquare inch. It will be quite accurate enough for our present purpose to\r\nassume that the average density of rock is three times that of water:\r\nthe pressure of ten feet of rock would therefore produce the same\r\npressure as thirty feet of water, that is to say, fifteen pounds on the\r\nsquare inch. The pressure due to the superincumbent weight of a mile of\r\nrock would be more than three tons on the square inch. At the depth of\r\nten miles beneath the earth’s surface the pressure, amounting as it does\r\nto over thirty tons on the square inch, would very nearly equal the\r\npressure produced on the inside of a 100-ton gun when the charge of\r\ncordite has been exploded to drive the missile forth. This is indeed\r\nabout as large a pressure as can well be dealt with artificially, for we\r\nknow that the 100-ton gun has to be enormously strong if it is to resist\r\nthis pressure. But ten miles of rock is as nothing compared with the\r\nthickness of rock that produces the pressures in the earth’s interior.\r\nEven if a shell of rocks ten miles thick were removed from the surface\r\nit would alter the diameter of our globe by no more than one\r\nfour-hundredth part. At the depth of about thirty miles from the surface\r\nthe pressure in the earth’s interior would amount to some 100 tons on\r\neach square inch. With each increase in depth the pressure increases\r\nenormously, though it may not be correct to say that the pressure is\r\nproportional to the depth. A pressure of 1,000 tons on the square inch\r\nmust exist at a depth which is still quite small in comparison with the\r\nradius of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe have not, and apparently cannot have, the least experimental\r\nknowledge of the properties of matter at the moment when it is subjected\r\nto pressure amounting to thousands of tons per square inch; still less\r\ncan we determine the behaviour of matter at that pressure of scores of\r\nthousands of tons, to which much of the interior of the earth is at this\r\nmoment subjected. Professor Dewar, in his memorable researches, has\r\nrevealed to us the remarkable changes exhibited in the properties of\r\nmatter when that matter has been cooled to a temperature which lies in\r\nthe vicinity of absolute zero. We can, however, hardly hope that any\r\nexperiments will give us information as to the properties of matter when\r\nheated to a temperature vastly transcending that which could ever be\r\nproduced in our most powerful electric furnaces, and at the same time\r\nexposed to a pressure hundreds of times, or indeed we may say thousands\r\nof times, greater than any pressure that has ever been produced\r\nartificially by the action of the most violent explosive with which the\r\ndiscoveries of chemistry have made us acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—THREE CONSECUTIVE SHELLS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe really do not know how far the laws of heat, which have been employed\r\nin showing that the temperature must increase as the depth increases,\r\ncan be considered as valid under the extreme condition to which matter\r\nis subjected in the deep interior of our globe. The laws may be\r\nprofoundly modified. It suffices, fortunately for our present argument,\r\nto say that, so far as observations have been possible, the temperature\r\ndoes gradually increase with the depth, and that this increase must\r\nstill continue from stratum to stratum as greater depths are reached,\r\nunless it should be found that by the excessive exaltation of\r\ntemperature and the vast intensity of pressure certain properties of\r\nmatter become so transformed as to render the laws of heat, as we know\r\nthem, inapplicable.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent chapters we shall have some further points to consider\r\nwith respect to the interior of the earth and its physical\r\ncharacteristics, which are, however, not necessary for our present\r\nargument. What we now desire to prove can be deduced from the\r\ndemonstrated fact that the earth’s temperature does steadily increase\r\nfrom the level of constant temperature, 100 feet below the surface, down\r\nto the greatest depth to which thermometers have ever been lowered. We\r\nmay presume that the same law holds at very much greater depths, even if\r\nit does not hold all the way to the centre.\r\n\r\nTo make our argument clear, let us think of three different strata of\r\nrock. This time, however, we shall suppose them to cover the whole\r\nearth, and we shall consider them to lie within the first mile from the\r\nsurface; they will thus be well within the region explored by\r\nobservation (Fig. 24). We shall also regard them as shells of uniform\r\nthickness, and it will be convenient to think of them as being so very\r\nthin that we may consider any one of the shells called A to have\r\npractically a uniform temperature. The next shell B immediately inside A\r\nwill have a slightly greater temperature, and be also regarded as\r\nuniform, and the shell immediately inside that again will have a\r\ntemperature greater still. We shall call the innermost of the three\r\nshells C, and C is hotter than the next outer shell B, while B is hotter\r\nthan A. The laws of heat tell us that as B and A are in contact, and\r\nthat as B is continually hotter than A, then B must be continuously\r\ntransmitting heat to A. In fact, B appears to be constantly endeavouring\r\nto reduce itself to the temperature of A by sharing with A the excess of\r\ntemperature which it possesses. But if we consider the relation between\r\nthe shell B and the hotter shell C, immediately beneath it, we see that\r\nprecisely the same argument will show that B is constantly receiving\r\nheat from C. We thus see that while B is continuously discharging heat\r\nfrom its outside surface, it is as constantly receiving heat which\r\nenters through its inside surface. Heat enters B from C, and heat passes\r\nfrom B into A, so that B is in fact a channel through which heat passes\r\nfrom C into A.\r\n\r\nThat which we have shown to take place in those three consecutive layers\r\nin the earth’s crust must also take place in every three consecutive\r\nlayers. Each layer is continually receiving heat from the layer below,\r\nand is as constantly communicating heat to the layer above. No doubt the\r\nrocks are very bad conductors of heat, so that the transmission of heat\r\nfrom layer to layer is a very slow process. But even if this flow of\r\nheat be slow, it is incessant, so that in the course of ages large\r\nquantities of heat are gradually transmitted from the earth’s interior,\r\nand ultimately reach the level of constant temperature. There is\r\nnothing, however, to impede their outward progress, so at last the heat\r\nreaches the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface has been reached, then another law of heat declares\r\nwhat must happen next. It is, of course, by conduction that the heat\r\npasses from layer to layer in its outward progress, until it ultimately\r\ngains the surface. At the surface the heat is then absolutely removed\r\nfrom the solid earth either by the convection through the air or by\r\ndirect radiation into space.\r\n\r\nI may here interrupt the argument for a moment to make quite clear a\r\npoint which might perhaps otherwise offer some difficulty to the reader.\r\nWhen this outward flow of heat reaches the superficial layers it\r\nbecomes, of course, mixed up with the heat which has been absorbed by\r\nthe soil from the direct radiation of the sun, and this varies, of\r\ncourse, with the hour of the day and with the season of the year. The\r\nheat which steadily leaks from the interior has an effect on the rocks\r\nnear the surface, which is only infinitesimal in comparison with the\r\nheat which they receive from periodic causes. We may, however, say that\r\nwhatever would be the temperature of the rock, so far as the periodic\r\ncauses are concerned, the actual temperature is always to some minute\r\nextent increased by reason of the heat from the earth’s interior. The\r\nargument is, perhaps, still clearer if, instead of attending to the\r\nearth’s surface, we think only of that shell, some 100 feet down, which\r\nmarks the limit of the depth to which the seasonal and diurnal\r\nvariations of heat extend. The argument shows how the internal heat of\r\nthe earth, passing from shell to shell in the interior, reaches this\r\nlayer of constant temperature, and passing through it, enters into those\r\nsuperficial strata of the earth which are exposed to the seasonal\r\nvariations. With what befalls that heat ultimately we need not now\r\nconcern ourselves; it suffices for our argument to show that there is a\r\ncurrent of heat outward across this level. It is a current which is\r\nnever reversed, and consequently must produce a never-ceasing drainage\r\nfrom the heat with which it would seem that the interior of the earth is\r\nso copiously provided.\r\n\r\nCalculations have been made to ascertain how much heat passes annually\r\nfrom the earth’s interior, across this surface of constant temperature,\r\nout into the superficial regions from which in due course it becomes\r\nlost by radiation. A convenient way of measuring a quantity of heat is\r\nby the amount of ice it will melt, for of course a definite quantity of\r\nheat is required to melt a definite quantity of ice. It has been\r\nestimated by Professor J. D. Everett, F.R.S., that the amount of\r\ninternal heat escaping from our earth each year would be sufficient to\r\nmelt a shell of ice one-fifth of an inch thick over the whole surface of\r\nthe globe. We cannot indeed pretend that any determination of the actual\r\nloss of heat which our earth experiences could be very precise.\r\nSufficient observations have not yet been obtained, for the operation is\r\nso slow that an immense period would have to elapse before the total\r\nquantity of heat lost would be sufficient to produce effects large\r\nenough to be measured accurately. But now let us hasten to add that, for\r\nthe argument as to the nebular theory with which we are at present\r\nconcerned, it is not really material to know the precise rate at which\r\nheat is lost. It is absolutely certain that a perennial leakage of heat\r\nfrom the interior of the earth does take place. This fact, and not the\r\namount of that leakage, is the essential point.\r\n\r\nAnd this loss, which is at present going on, has been going on\r\ncontinually. Heat from the earth has been lost this year and last year;\r\nit has been lost for hundreds of years and for thousands of years. Not\r\nalone during the periods of human history has the earth’s heat been\r\ndeclining. Even throughout those periods, those overwhelming periods\r\nwhich geology has revealed to us, has this earth of ours been slowly\r\nparting with its heat.\r\n\r\nLet us pursue this reflection to its legitimate consequence. Whatever\r\nmay ultimately become of that heat, it is certain that once radiated\r\ninto space it is lost for ever so far as this globe is concerned. You\r\nmust not imagine that the warm beams of the sun possess any power of\r\nreplenishment by which they can restore to the earth the heat which it\r\nhas been squandering for unlimited ages; we have already explained that\r\nthe effect of the heat radiated to us from the sun is purely\r\nsuperficial. Even amid the glories of the tropics, even in the burning\r\nheat of the desert, the vertical sun produces no appreciable effects at\r\ndepths greater than this critical limit, which is about 100 feet below\r\nthe surface. The rigours of an Arctic winter have as little effect in\r\nreducing the temperature of the rocks at that depth as the torrid heat\r\nat the Equator has in raising it. The effect in each case is nothing.\r\n\r\nThe argument which we are here employing to deduce the nebulous origin\r\nof our earth from the increase of temperature with increase in depth in\r\nthe earth’s crust must be cleared from an objection. It is necessary to\r\nexplain the matter fully, because it touches on a doctrine of very great\r\ninterest and importance.\r\n\r\nThat a rotating body should possess a quantity of energy in virtue of\r\nits rotation will be familiar to anyone who has ever turned a grindstone\r\nor watched the fly-wheel of an engine. A certain amount of work has to\r\nbe expended to set the heavy wheel into rotation, and when the machine\r\nis called upon to do work it will yield up energy and its motion will\r\nundergo a corresponding abatement. The heavy fly-wheel of the machine in\r\na rolling mill contains, in virtue of its motion, enough energy to\r\novercome the tremendous resistance of the materials submitted to it.\r\nOnce upon a time the earth revolved upon its axis in six hours, instead\r\nof in the twenty-four hours which it now requires. At that time the\r\nenergy of the rotation must have been sixteenfold what it is at present.\r\nThis consideration shows that fifteen-sixteenths of the energy that the\r\nearth originally possessed in its rotation has disappeared, and we want\r\nto know what has become of it.\r\n\r\nWe are here entering upon a matter of some difficulty. It is connected\r\nwith that remarkable chapter in astronomy which describes the evolution\r\nof the earth-moon system. The moon was originally a part of the earth,\r\nfor in very early times, when the earth was still in a plastic state, a\r\nseparation would seem to have taken place, by which a small piece broke\r\noff to form the moon, which has been gradually revolving in an enlarging\r\norbit until it has attained the position it now occupies. A considerable\r\nportion of the energy of the earth’s rotation has been applied to the\r\npurpose of driving the moon out to its present path, but there is a\r\nlarge remainder which cannot be so accounted for. It is well known that\r\nthe evolution of the moon has been a remarkable consequence of tidal\r\naction. There are tides which sway to and fro in the waters on the\r\nearth’s surface; there are tides in any molten or viscous matter that\r\nthe earth may contain, and there are even certain small tidal\r\ndisplacements in the solid material of our globe. Tides of any kind will\r\ngenerate friction, and friction produces heat, and the energy of the\r\nearth’s rotation, which we have not been able to account for otherwise,\r\nhas been thus transformed into heat. Throughout the whole interior of\r\nthe earth heat has been produced by the tidal displacement of its parts.\r\nThe question therefore arises as to whether the internal heat of the\r\nearth may not receive an adequate explanation from this tidal action,\r\nwhich is certainly sufficient as to quantity. It is easy to calculate\r\nwhat the total quantity of this tidal heat may have been. We know the\r\nenergy which the earth had when it rotated in six hours, and we know\r\nthat it now retains no more than a sixteenth of that amount. We know\r\nalso precisely how much was absorbed in the removal of the moon, and the\r\nbalance can be evaluated in heat. It can be shown, and the fact is a\r\nvery striking one, that the quantity of heat thus arising would be\r\nsufficient to account many times over for the internal heat of the\r\nearth. It might therefore be urged plausibly that the internal heat\r\nwhich we actually find has had its origin in this way. And if this were\r\nthe case the argument which we are using in favour of the nebular origin\r\nof the earth, would be, of course, invalidated.\r\n\r\nWe may state the issue in a slightly different manner, as follows. Heat\r\nthere is undoubtedly in the earth; that heat might have come from the\r\nprimæval nebula as we have supposed, and as in actual fact it did come.\r\nBut apparently it might have come from the tidal friction. Why then are\r\nwe entitled to reject the latter view, and say that the tidal friction\r\nwill not explain the internal heat, and why are we compelled to fall\r\nback on the only other explanation?\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin suggested a test for deciding to which of these two sources\r\nthe earth’s internal heat was to be attributed. Professor G. H. Darwin\r\napplied the test and decided the issue. We have dwelt upon the rate at\r\nwhich the heat increases with the descent, this rate being about one\r\ndegree every sixty-six feet. Now the distribution of the heat, if it had\r\ncome from the tidal action, would be quite different from the\r\ndistribution which would result from the gradual efflux of heat from the\r\ncentre in the process of cooling. And, speaking quite generally, we may\r\nsurmise that the heat produced by tidal friction would be distributed\r\nrather more towards the exterior of the earth than at its centre. We\r\nmight therefore reasonably expect that if the internal heat of the earth\r\narose from tidal friction it would be more uniformly distributed\r\nthroughout the globe, and there would not be so great a contrast between\r\nthe high temperature of the interior and the lesser temperatures near\r\nthe surface as there is when the heat distribution is merely the result\r\nof cooling. It has been proved that if the internal heat had its origin\r\nfrom the tidal friction, the rate of increase with the depth would be\r\ntotally different from what it is actually found to be. It would be\r\nnecessary to go down 2,000 feet to obtain an increase of one degree,\r\ninstead of only sixty-six feet, as is actually the case.\r\n\r\nHence we conclude that the increasing heat met with in descending\r\nthrough the earth’s crust is not accounted for by tidal friction; it has\r\nits origin in the other alternative, namely, from the cooling of the\r\nprimæval nebula. The heat which was undoubtedly produced by the tidal\r\nfriction has gradually become blended with the heat from the other, and,\r\nas we must now say, the principal source. The facts with regard to the\r\nrate of increase with depth thus show that, whatever the tides may have\r\ndone in producing internal heat, there has been another and a still more\r\npotent cause in operation. The important conclusion for our present\r\npurpose is that our argument may justly proceed without taking account\r\nof the effect of tidal friction.\r\n\r\nWe are led by these considerations to a knowledge of a great\r\ntransformation in the nature of our globe which must have occurred in\r\nthe course of ages. We have seen that this earth is gradually losing\r\nheat from its interior, and we have seen that this loss of heat is\r\nincessant. From the fountains of heat, still so copious, in the interior\r\nthe supply is gradually dissipating. Now heat is only a form of energy,\r\nand energy, like matter, cannot itself be created out of nothing. There\r\ncan be no creation of heat in our earth without a corresponding\r\nexpenditure of energy. If, therefore, the earth is radiating heat, then,\r\nas there is no known or, indeed, conceivable source of energy by which\r\nan equivalent can be restored, it follows that the earth must have less\r\ninternal heat now than it had at any earlier period. No doubt the\r\nprocess of cooling is excessively slow. The earth has less internal heat\r\nat present than it had a hundred years ago, but I do not suppose that\r\neven in a thousand years, or perhaps in ten thousand years, there would\r\nbe any appreciable decline in the quantity of heat, so far as any\r\nobvious manifestations of that heat are concerned. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the earth must have been hotter, even though there are not\r\nany observations to which we can appeal to verify the statement; and as\r\nour retrospect extends further and still further through the ages we see\r\nthat the globe must have been ever hotter and ever still hotter.\r\nWhatever be the heat contained in our earth now, it must have contained\r\nvastly more heat ten million years ago; how otherwise could the daily\r\nleakage of heat for all those ten million years have been supplied? It\r\nfollows that there must have been much more heat somewhere in our earth\r\nten million years ago than there is at present, and the further our\r\nretrospect extends the hotter do we find the earth to have been. There\r\nwas a time when the temperature of the earth’s surface must have been\r\nwarmed not alone by such sunbeams as fell upon it, but by the passage of\r\nthe heat from the interior.\r\n\r\nNo matter how early be the period which we consider, we find the same\r\ncauses to be in operation. There was a time when, owing to the internal\r\nheat, the surface of the earth must have been as hot as boiling water.\r\nThe loss of heat by radiation must then have taken place much more\r\ncopiously than it does at present. The argument we are pursuing must\r\ntherefore have applied with even greater force in those early days.\r\nThere was a time when the materials at the surface of the earth must\r\nhave been intensely heated, when they must have even been red-hot. There\r\nwas a time when the earth’s surface must have had a temperature like\r\nthat of the lava as it issues from a volcano. There must have been a\r\ntime when the surface of the earth was not even solid, when indeed it\r\nwas a viscid liquid, and earlier still the liquid must have been more\r\nand more incandescent. From that brilliant surface heat was vehemently\r\nradiated. Each day the globe was hotter than on the succeeding day.\r\nThere is no break in the argument. We have to think of this glowing\r\nglobe passing through those phases through which we know that all matter\r\nwill pass if only we apply to it sufficient heat. The globe assumed the\r\nliquid state from that state which is demanded by a temperature still\r\nhigher, the state in which the matter is actually in the form of vapour.\r\nEven the most refractory substances will take the form of vapour at a\r\nvery high temperature.\r\n\r\nThus we are conducted to a remarkable conception of the condition in\r\nwhich the materials now forming our solid earth must have been in the\r\nexceedingly remote past. What is now our earth must once have been a\r\ngreat quantity of heated vapour. It need hardly be said that in that\r\nform the volume of the earth was much larger than the volume which the\r\nearth has at present, while no doubt the mass of the earth then was even\r\nless than the mass of the earth now, by reason of the meteoric matter\r\nwhich has been drawn in by our globe.\r\n\r\nBut even when our earth was in this inflated state of vapour our\r\nargument can be still maintained. Thus we see that the earth, or rather\r\nthe cloud of vapour which was ultimately to form the earth, is ever\r\ngrowing larger and larger in our retrospect, ever becoming more and more\r\nrarefied; and it may well have been that there was a time when the\r\nmaterials of this earth occupied a volume thousands of times greater\r\nthan they do at present.\r\n\r\nIn a previous chapter we have seen how the sun was at one time in the\r\nnebulous state, and now we have been led to a similar conclusion with\r\nregard to the earth. At that time, of course, the sun was greatly in\r\nexcess of its present dimensions, and the earth was also greatly\r\nswollen. The nebula which formed our sun, and the nebula which formed\r\nour earth, were both so vast as to be confluent; they were indeed both\r\npart of the same vast nebula.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the Earth’s Beginning so far as modern science can make it\r\nclear to us. We have at least indicated the course which events must\r\nhave taken according to the laws of nature as we understand them. Many\r\nof the details of the great evolution are no doubt unknown at present,\r\nand perhaps must ever remain so. That the events which we have\r\nendeavoured to describe do substantially represent the actual evolution\r\nof our system is the famous Nebular Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                       EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nInterior of the Earth—Illustration from Norway—Solids and\r\n    Liquids—Rigidity of the Interior of the Earth—Earthquakes,\r\n    how caused—Their Testimony as to the Rigidity of the\r\n    Earth—Delicate Instrument for Measuring Earthquake Tremors—The\r\n    Seismometer—Professor Milne’s Work in the Isle of Wight—Different\r\n    Earthquake Groups—Precursors and Echoes—Vibrations transmitted\r\n    through the Earth’s Centre—Earthquakes in England—Other Evidence of\r\n    the Earth’s Rigidity—Krakatoa, August 27th, 1883—The Sounds from\r\n    Krakatoa—The Diverging Waves—The Krakatoa Dust—The Hurricane\r\n    Overhead—Strange Signs in the Heavens—The Blood-red Skies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN this chapter we shall learn what we can as to the physical condition\r\nof the interior of our earth so far as it may be reasonably inferred\r\nfrom the facts of observation. We have already explained in the last\r\nchapter that a very high temperature must be found at the depth of even\r\na small fraction of the earth’s radius, and we have pointed out that the\r\nexcessively high pressure characteristic of the earth’s interior must be\r\nborne in mind in any consideration as to the condition of the matter\r\nthere found.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for instance, that primary question in terrestrial physics,\r\nas to whether the interior of the earth is liquid or solid. If we were\r\nto judge merely from the temperatures reasonably believed to exist at a\r\ndepth of some twenty miles, and if we might overlook the question of\r\npressure, we should certainly say that the earth’s interior must be in a\r\nfluid state. It seems at least certain that the temperatures to be found\r\nat depths of two score miles, and still more at greater depths, must be\r\nso high that the most refractory solids, whether metals or minerals,\r\nwould at once yield if we could subject them to such temperatures in our\r\nlaboratories. At such temperatures every metal would become fluid, even\r\nif it were not transformed into a cloud of vapour. But none of our\r\nlaboratory experiments can tell us whether, under the pressure of\r\nthousands of tons on the square inch, the application of any heat\r\nwhatever would be adequate to transform solids into liquids. It may\r\nindeed be reasonably doubted whether the terms solids and liquids are\r\napplicable, in the sense in which we understand them, to the materials\r\nforming the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune some years ago to enjoy a most interesting trip\r\nto Norway, in company with a distinguished geologist. Under his guidance\r\nI there saw evidence which demonstrates conclusively that, when\r\nsubjected to great pressure, solids, as we should call them, behave in a\r\nmanner which, if not that of actual liquids, resembles at all events in\r\nsome of its characteristics the behaviour of liquids. These rocks in\r\nsome places are conglomerates, of which the leading constituents are\r\nwater-worn pebbles of granite. These pebbles are of various sizes, from\r\nmarbles to paving-stones. In some parts of the country these granite\r\npebbles remain in the form which they acquired on the beach on which\r\nthey were rolled by the primæval ocean; in other parts of the same\r\ninteresting region the form of the pebbles has been greatly changed from\r\nwhat it was originally. For in the course of geological periods, and\r\nafter the pebbles had become consolidated into the conglomerate, the\r\nrock so formed had been in some cases submitted to enormous pressure.\r\nThis may have been lateral pressure, such as is found to have occurred\r\nin many other places, where it has produced the well-known geological\r\nphenomenon of strata crumpled into folds. In the present case, however,\r\nit seemed more probable that it was the actual weight of the\r\nsuperincumbent rocks, which once lay over these beds of conglomerate,\r\nwhich produced the surprising transformation. It seems to be not at all\r\nimprobable that at one time these beds of conglomerate must have been\r\ncovered with strata of which the thickness is so great that it may\r\nactually be estimated by miles. There has, however, been immense\r\ndenudation of the superficial rocks in this part, at all events, of\r\nNorway, so that in the course of ages these strata, overlying the\r\nconglomerate for ages, have been so far worn away, and indeed removed,\r\nby the action of ice and the action of water that the conglomerate is\r\nnow exposed to view. It offers for our examination striking indications\r\nof the enormous pressure to which it was subjected during the\r\nincalculable ages of geological time.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this long continuance of great pressure upon the pebbles\r\nof the conglomerate in certain parts of the country has been most\r\nastonishing. The granite in the pebbles still retains its characteristic\r\ncrystalline structure; it has obviously not undergone anything that\r\ncould be described as fusion; yet under the influence of the two factors\r\nof that pressure, namely, its intensity and its long continuance, the\r\ngranite pebbles have yielded. In some cases they are slightly elongated,\r\nin others they are much elongated, while in yet others they are even\r\nrolled out flat. At different places along the valley the various phases\r\nof the transformation can be studied. We can find places where the\r\npebbles seem little altered, and then we can trace each stage until the\r\nsolid granite pebbles have, by the application of excessive pressure,\r\nbeen compressed into thin sheets whose character it would not have been\r\neasy to divine if it had not been possible to trace out their history.\r\nThese sheets lie close and parallel, so that the material thus produced\r\nacquires some of the characteristics of slate. It splits easily along\r\nthe flattened sheets, and this rolled-out conglomerate is indeed\r\nactually used as a substitute for slate, and in some places there are\r\nhouses roofed with the conglomerate which has been treated in this\r\nextraordinary fashion.\r\n\r\nThis fact will illustrate a principle, already well known in the arts,\r\nthat many, if not all, solids may be made to flow like liquids if only\r\nadequate pressure be applied. The making of lead tubes is a well-known\r\npractical illustration of the same principle, for these tubes are simply\r\nformed by forcing solid lead by the hydraulic press through a mould\r\nwhich imparts the desired form.\r\n\r\nIf then a solid can be made to behave like a liquid, even with such\r\npressures as are within our control, how are we to suppose that the\r\nsolids would behave with such pressures as those to which they are\r\nsubjected in the interior of the earth? The fact is that the terms solid\r\nand liquid, at least as we understand them, appear to have no physical\r\nmeaning with regard to bodies subjected to these stupendous pressures,\r\nand this must be carefully borne in mind when we are discussing the\r\nnature of the interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that the interior of the earth in its\r\nactual physical state seems to possess at least one of the most\r\nimportant characteristics of a solid, for it seems to be intensely\r\nrigid. We mean by this, that the material of the earth, or rather each\r\nparticle of that material, is very little inclined to move from its\r\nposition with reference to the adjacent particles by the application of\r\nforce. Possibly a liquid, such as water, might not behave very\r\ndifferently in this respect from a solid such as cast iron, if each of\r\nthem were exposed to a pressure of scores of thousands of tons per\r\nsquare inch, as are the materials which form the great bulk of the\r\nearth. But, without speculating on these points, we are able to\r\ndemonstrate that the earth, as a whole, does exhibit extreme rigidity.\r\nThis is one of the most remarkable discoveries which has ever been made\r\nwith regard to the physics of our earth. The discovery that the earth is\r\nso rigid is mainly due to Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\nWe shall now mention the line of evidence which appears to prove, in the\r\nsimplest and most direct manner, the excessive rigidity of our earth. It\r\nis derived from the study of earthquake phenomena, and we must endeavour\r\nto set it forth with the completeness its importance deserves.\r\n\r\nAs to the immediate cause of earthquakes, there is no doubt considerable\r\ndifference of opinion. But I think it will not be doubted that an\r\nearthquake is one of the consequences, though perhaps a remote one, of\r\nthe gradual loss of internal heat from the earth. As this terrestrial\r\nheat is gradually declining, it follows from the law that we have\r\nalready so often had occasion to use that the bulk of the earth must be\r\nshrinking. No doubt the diminution in the earth’s diameter, due to the\r\nloss of heat must be excessively small, even in a long period of time.\r\nThe cause, however, is continually in operation, and accordingly the\r\ncrust of the earth has, from time to time, to be accommodated to the\r\nfact that the whole globe is lessening. The circumference of our earth\r\nat the Equator must be gradually declining; a certain length in that\r\ncircumference is lost each year. We may admit that loss to be a quantity\r\nfar too small to be measured by any observations as yet obtainable, but,\r\nnevertheless, it is productive of phenomena so important that it cannot\r\nbe overlooked.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these considerations that the rocks which form the\r\nearth’s crust over the surface of the continents and the islands, or\r\nbeneath the beds of ocean, must have a lessening acreage year by year.\r\nThese rocks must therefore submit to compression, either continuously or\r\nfrom time to time, and the necessary yielding of the rocks will in\r\ngeneral take place in those regions where the materials of the earth’s\r\ncrust happen to have comparatively small powers of resistance. The acts\r\nof compression will often, and perhaps generally, not proceed with\r\nuniformity, but rather with small successive shifts, and even though the\r\ndisplacements of the rocks in these shifts be actually very small, yet\r\nthe pressures to which the rocks are subjected are so vast that a very\r\nsmall shift may correspond to a very great terrestrial disturbance.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that there is a slight shift in the rocks on each\r\nside of a crack, or fault, at a depth of ten miles. It must be\r\nremembered that the pressure ten miles down would be about thirty-five\r\ntons on the square inch. Even a slight displacement of one extensive\r\nsurface over another, the sides being pressed together with a force of\r\nthirty-five tons on the square inch, would be an operation necessarily\r\naccompanied by violence greatly exceeding that which we might expect\r\nfrom so small a displacement if the forces concerned had been only of\r\nmore ordinary magnitude. On account of this great multiplication of the\r\nintensity of the phenomenon, merely a small rearrangement of the rocks\r\nin the crust of the earth, in pursuance of the necessary work of\r\naccommodating its volume to the perpetual shrinkage, might produce an\r\nexcessively violent shock extending far and wide. The effect of such a\r\nshock would be propagated in the form of waves through the globe, just\r\nas a violent blow given at one end of a bar of iron by a hammer is\r\npropagated through the bar in the form of waves. When the effect of this\r\ninternal adjustment reaches the earth’s surface, it will sometimes be\r\ngreat enough to be perceptible in the shaking it gives that surface. The\r\nshaking may be so violent that buildings may not be able to withstand\r\nit. Such is the phenomenon of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes have been made to yield testimony of the most striking\r\ncharacter with regard to the rigidity of the earth. The researches we\r\nare now to describe are mainly due to Professor Milne, who, having\r\nenjoyed the advantage of studying earthquakes in their natural home in\r\nJapan, where are to be found some of the most earthquake-shaken regions\r\nof this earth, has now transferred his observations of these phenomena\r\nto the more peaceful regions of the Isle of Wight. But though the Isle\r\nof Wight is perhaps one of the last places in the world to which anyone\r\nwho desired to experience violent earthquake shocks would be likely to\r\ngo, yet by the help of a beautiful apparatus Professor Milne is actually\r\nable to witness important earthquakes that are happening all over the\r\nworld. He has a demonstration of these earthquakes in the indications of\r\nan extremely sensitive instrument which he has erected in his home at\r\nShide.\r\n\r\nWhen our earth is shaken by one of those occasional adjustments of the\r\ncrust which I have described, the wave that spreads like a pulsation\r\nfrom the centre of agitation extends all over our globe and, indeed I\r\nmay say, is transmitted right through it. At the surface lying\r\nimmediately over the centre of disturbance there will be a violent\r\nshock. In the surrounding country, and often over great distances, the\r\nearthquake may also be powerful enough to produce destructive effects.\r\nThe convulsion may also be manifested over a far larger area of country\r\nin a way which makes the shock to be felt, though the damage wrought may\r\nnot be appreciable. But beyond a limited distance from the centre of the\r\nagitation the earthquake will produce no destructive effects upon\r\nbuildings, and will not even cause vibrations that would be appreciable\r\nto ordinary observation.\r\n\r\nThis earth of ours may transmit from an earthquake pulses of a very\r\ndistinct and definite character, which are too weak to be perceived by\r\nour unaided senses; but, just as the microscope will render objects\r\nvisible which are too minute to be perceived without this aid to the\r\nordinary vision, so these faint earth-pulses may be rendered perceptible\r\nby the delicate indications of an instrument which perceives and records\r\ntremors that would pass unnoticed by our ordinary observations. The\r\ningenious instrument for studying earthquakes is called a seismometer.\r\nIt marks on a revolving drum of paper the particulars of those\r\ninfinitesimal tremors by which the earth is almost daily agitated in one\r\nplace or another.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for example, that an earthquake occurs in Japan, in\r\nwhich much agitated country it is, I believe, estimated that no fewer\r\nthan one thousand earthquakes of varying degrees of intensity occur\r\nannually in one district or another. Let us suppose that this earthquake\r\nbehaves as serious earthquakes usually do; that it knocks down buildings\r\nand monuments, causes landslips, raises great waves in the sea and hurls\r\nthem as inundations on the land. We may also suppose that it issues\r\ntragically in the loss of many lives and that there is a destruction of\r\nmuch property, and that its energies in the acutely violent form extend\r\nover, let us say, an area of a hundred square miles. Beyond that area of\r\ngreatest destruction such an earthquake would be felt over a great\r\nextent of country as a shaking more or less vehement, and characteristic\r\nrumbling sounds would be heard. But the intensity declines with the\r\ndistance, and we may feel confident that not even the faintest\r\nindications of the earthquake would be perceptible by the unaided senses\r\nat a thousand miles from its origin. A thousand miles is, however, less\r\nthan a fifth of the distance between Tokio and Shide, in the Isle of\r\nWight, measured in a great circle round the earth’s surface. The acutest\r\nsense could not perceive the slightest indication of the convulsion in\r\nJapan at even half the distance between these two places. But the earth\r\ntransmits so faithfully the undulations committed to its care that\r\nthough the intensity may have declined so as to be no longer perceptible\r\nto the unaided sense, it is still possible that they may be shown\r\ndistinctly on the seismometer in Professor Milne’s laboratory, even\r\nafter a journey of five thousand miles. This instrument not only\r\nannounces that an earthquake has been in progress some little time\r\npreviously, but the recording pencil reproduces with marvellous fidelity\r\nsome actual details of the vibration. The movements of the line up and\r\ndown on the revolving drum of paper show how the convulsions succeed\r\neach other, and their varying intensity. Thus Professor Milne is enabled\r\nto set down some features of the earthquake long before the post brings\r\nan account of the convulsion from the unhappy locality.\r\n\r\nProfessor Milne’s account of work in studying earthquakes has the charm\r\nof a romance, even while it faithfully sets out the facts of Nature. I\r\nhave supposed the earthquake to take place in Japan; but we must observe\r\nthat the seismometer at Shide will also take account of considerable\r\nearthquakes in whatever part of the world the disturbance may arise.\r\nThere are, for example, localities in the West Indies in which\r\nearthquakes are by no means infrequent, though they may not be phenomena\r\nof almost daily occurrence, as they are in Japan. Every considerable\r\nearthquake, no matter where its centre may lie, produces in our whole\r\nglobe a vibration or a tingle which is sufficient to be manifested by\r\nthe delicate indications of the seismometer at Shide. Thus this\r\ninstrument, which in the morning may record an earthquake from Japan,\r\nwill in the afternoon of the same day delineate with equal fidelity an\r\nearthquake from the opposite hemisphere in the neighbourhood of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nIn each locality in which earthquakes are chronic it would seem as if\r\nthere must be some particularly weak spot in the earth some miles below\r\nthe surface. A shrinkage of the earth, in the course of the incessant\r\nadjustment between the interior and the exterior, will take place by\r\noccasional little jumps at this particular centre. The fact that there\r\nis this weak spot at which small adjustments are possible may provide,\r\nas it were, a safety-valve for other places in the same part of the\r\nworld. Instead of a general shrinking, the materials would be\r\nsufficiently elastic and flexible to allow the shrinking for a very\r\nlarge area to be done at this particular locality. In this way we may\r\nexplain the fact that immense tracts on the earth are practically free\r\nfrom earthquakes of a serious character, while in the less fortunate\r\nregions the earthquakes are more or less perennial.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of an earthquake record, a _seismogram_, if we give\r\nit the correct designation, depend on the distance of the origin from\r\nthe locality where the record is made. The length of the journey, as\r\nmight be expected, tells on the character of the inscription which the\r\nearthquake waves make on the drum. If, for instance, the first\r\nintimation of a large earthquake received at Shide precedes the second\r\nby about thirty-five minutes, it may be concluded that the earthquake\r\nhas come from Japan.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the shocks, with their origin in the West Indies, will\r\nproceed from their particular earthquake centre, and consequently all\r\nthe earthquakes from this source will possess a characteristic\r\nresemblance. The Japan group of earthquakes will have, so to speak, a\r\nfamily resemblance; and the Trinidad group of earthquakes, though quite\r\ndifferent from the Japan group, will also possess a family resemblance.\r\nThese features are faithfully transmitted by undulations through the\r\nearth and round the earth; thus in due course they reach the Isle of\r\nWight, and they are reproduced by the pencil of the seismometer. The\r\ndifferent earthquakes of a family may differ in size, in intensity, and\r\nundulation, but they will have the features appropriate to the\r\nparticular group from which they come. From long experience Professor\r\nMilne has become so familiar with the lineaments of these earthquake\r\nfamilies, that in his study at Shide, as he looks at the indications of\r\nhis instrument, he is able to say, for example, “Here is an earthquake,\r\nand it is a little earthquake from Japan;” then a little later, when a\r\nnew earthquake begins, he will say, “And here is a big earthquake from\r\nTrinidad.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Milne’s apparatus has brought us remarkable information with\r\nregard to the interior of the earth. The story which we have to tell is\r\nreally one of the most astonishing in physical science. Let us suppose\r\nthat an earthquake originates in Japan. We shall assume that the\r\nearthquake is a vigorous one, capable of producing bold and definite\r\nindications on the seismometer even in the Isle of Wight. It is to be\r\nnoted that this instrument is not content merely with a single version\r\nof the story of that earthquake; it will indeed repeat that story twice\r\nmore. First of all, about a quarter of an hour after a shock has taken\r\nplace in Japan, the pencil of the seismometer commences to record. But\r\nthis record, though quite distinct, is not so boldly indicated as the\r\nsubsequent records of the same event which will presently be received.\r\nIt is to be regarded as a precursor. After the first record is completed\r\nthere is a pause of perhaps three-quarters of an hour, and then the\r\npencil of the seismometer commences again. It commences to give an\r\nearthquake record, but it is obviously only a second version of the same\r\nearthquake. For the ups and downs traced by the pencil are just the same\r\nrelatively as before. The picture given of the earthquake is, however,\r\non a much larger scale than the one that is first sent. The extent of\r\nthe shaking of the instrument in this second record is greater than in\r\nthe first, and all the details are more boldly drawn.\r\n\r\nAfter the second diagram has been received, there is yet another pause,\r\nwhich may be perhaps for half an hour. Then, by the same pencil, a third\r\nand last version is conveyed to the seismometer. This diagram is not\r\nquite so strong as the last, though stronger than the first; in it\r\nagain, however, the faithful pencil tells, with many a detail, what\r\nhappened in this earthquake at Japan.\r\n\r\nWe have first to explain how it occurs that there are three versions of\r\nthe event, for it need hardly be said that the same earthquake did not\r\ntake place three different times over. The point is indeed a beautiful\r\none. The explanation is so astonishing that we should hardly credit it\r\nwere it not established upon evidence that does not admit of a moment’s\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—EARTHQUAKE ROUTES FROM JAPAN TO THE ISLE OF\r\nWIGHT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining diagram we represent the position of Japan at one side\r\nof the earth, and the Isle of Wight at the other. When the earthquake\r\ntakes place at Japan it originates, as we have said, a series of\r\nvibrations through our globe. We must here distinguish between the\r\nrocks—I might almost say the comparatively pliant rocks—which form the\r\nearth’s crust, and those which form the intensely rigid core of the\r\ninterior of our globe. The vibrations which carry the tidings of the\r\nearthquake spread through the rocks on the surface, from the centre of\r\nthe disturbance, in gradually enlarging circles. We may liken the spread\r\nof these vibrations to the ripples in a pool of water which diverge from\r\nthe spot where a raindrop has fallen, or to the remarkable air-waves\r\nfrom Krakatoa, to which we shall presently refer. The vibrations\r\ntransmitted by the rocks on the surface, or on the floor of the ocean,\r\nwill carry the message all over the earth. As these rocks are flexible,\r\nat all events by comparison with the earth’s interior, the vibrations\r\nwill be correspondingly large, and will travel with vigour over land and\r\nunder sea. In due time they reach the Isle of Wight, where they set the\r\npencil of the seismometer at work. But there are different ways round\r\nthe earth from Japan to the Isle of Wight. There is the most direct\r\nroute across Asia and Europe; there is also the route across the\r\nPacific, America, and the Atlantic. The vibrations will travel by both\r\nroutes, and the former is the shorter of the two. The vibrations which\r\ntake the first route through the crust of the earth’s surface are\r\ntravelling by the shorter distance; they consequently reach Shide first,\r\nand render their version of what has happened. But the vibrations which,\r\nstarting from the centre of the disturbance, move through the earth’s\r\ncrust in an opposite direction will also in their due course of\r\nexpansion reach the Isle of Wight. They will have had a longer journey,\r\nand will consequently be somewhat enfeebled, though they will still\r\nretain the characteristics marking the particular earthquake centre from\r\nwhich they arose.\r\n\r\nWe thus account for both the second and the third of the different\r\nversions of the earthquake which are received at Shide. And now for the\r\nfirst of the three versions. This is the one which is of special\r\ninterest to us at present. The original subterranean impulse was, as we\r\nhave seen, propagated through the rocks forming the earth’s crust. Part\r\nof it, however, entered into the core forming the earth’s interior. The\r\nearthquake had the power not only of shaking the earth’s crust all over,\r\nbut it produced the astonishing effect of setting the whole interior of\r\nour globe into a tremble. There was not a single particle of our earth,\r\nfrom centre to surface, which was not made to vibrate, in some degree,\r\nin consequence of the earthquake. Certain of these vibrations, spreading\r\nfrom the centre of disturbance, took a direct course to the Isle of\r\nWight, right through the globe. They consequently had a shorter journey\r\nin travelling from Tokio to Shide than those which went round the\r\nearth’s crust. The former travelled near the chord, while the latter\r\ntravelled on the arc. Even for this reason alone the internal vibrations\r\nmight be expected to accomplish their journey more rapidly than the\r\nsuperficial movements. With the same velocity they would take a shorter\r\ntime for the journey. There is, however, another reason for the lesser\r\ntime taken by the internal vibrations. Not only is the journey shorter,\r\nbut the speed with which these vibrations travel through the solid earth\r\nis much greater than the speed with which superficial vibrations travel\r\nthrough the crust. It has been shown that the average velocity of these\r\nvibrations when travelling through the centre of the earth is rather\r\nmore than ten miles a second. The velocity varies with the square root\r\nof the depth, and near the surface it is scarcely two miles a second.\r\n\r\nThere are two points to be specially noticed. The vibrations, which,\r\npassing through the earth’s interior with a high velocity, arrive as\r\nprecursors, make a faithful diagram, but only on a very small scale. We\r\nsay that these vibrations have but small amplitude. This shows that the\r\nparticles in the earth’s interior are not much displaced by the\r\nearthquake, as compared with those on the earth’s crust, and this is one\r\nindication of the effective rigidity of the earth. It is also to be\r\nnoted that the great speed with which the vibrations traverse the solid\r\nearth is a consequence of the extreme rigidity of our globe. These\r\nvibrations travel more rapidly through the earth than they would do\r\nthrough a bar of solid steel. In other words, we have here a proof that,\r\nunder the influence of the tremendous pressures characteristic of the\r\nearth’s interior, the material of which that earth is composed,\r\nnotwithstanding the high temperature to which it is raised, possesses a\r\nrigidity which is practically greater than that of steel itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOWING LOCALITIES OF EARTHQUAKES]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most striking testimony that can be borne to the\r\nrigidity of our globe; but we must not imagine that we are dependent\r\nsolely upon the phenomena of earthquakes for the demonstration of this\r\nimportant point; there are other proofs. It can be shown that the ebb\r\nand flow of the tides on our coasts would be very different from that\r\nwhich they actually are were it not that the earth behaves as a rigid\r\nglobe. It has also been demonstrated that certain astronomical phenomena\r\nconnected with the way in which the earth turns round on its axis would\r\nnot be the same as we actually find them to be if the earth were not\r\nsolid in its interior.\r\n\r\nThe result of these investigations is to show that, though this globe of\r\nours must be excessively hot inside, so hot indeed that at ordinary\r\npressures even the most refractory solids would be liquefied or\r\nvaporised, yet under the influence of the pressure to which its\r\nmaterials are subjected the behaviour of that globe is as that of the\r\nmost rigidly solid body.\r\n\r\nHappily in this country we do not often experience earthquakes other\r\nthan delicate movements shown by the record of the seismometer. But\r\nthough most of us live our lives without ever having felt an earthquake\r\nshock, yet earthquakes do sometimes make themselves felt in Great\r\nBritain. The map we here give, which was drawn by Professor J. P.\r\nO’Reilly, indicates the localities in England in which from time to time\r\nearthquake shocks have been experienced.\r\n\r\nThe internal heat of the earth, derived from the primæval nebula, is in\r\nno way more strikingly illustrated than by the phenomena of volcanoes.\r\nWe have shown in this chapter that there is no longer any reason to\r\nbelieve that the earth is fluid in its interior. The evidence has proved\r\nthat, under the extraordinary pressure which prevails in the earth, the\r\nmaterials in the central portions of our globe behave with the\r\ncharacteristics of solids rather than of liquids. But though this\r\napplies to the deep-seated regions of our globe, it need not universally\r\napply at the surface or within a moderate depth from the surface. When\r\nthe circumstances are such that the pressure is relaxed, then the heat\r\nis permitted to exercise its property of transforming the solids into\r\nliquids. Masses of matter near the earth’s crust are thus, in certain\r\ncircumstances, and in certain localities, transformed into the fluid or\r\nviscid form. In that state they may issue from a volcano and flow in\r\nsluggish currents as lava.\r\n\r\nThere has been much difference of opinion as to the immediate cause of\r\nvolcanic action, but there can be little doubt that the energy which is\r\nmanifested in a volcanic eruption has been originally derived in some\r\nway from the contraction of the primæval nebula. The extraordinary\r\nvehemence that a volcanic eruption sometimes attains may be specially\r\nillustrated by the case of the great eruption of Krakatoa. It is,\r\nindeed, believed that in the annals of our earth there has been no\r\nrecord of a volcanic eruption so vast as that which bears the name of\r\nthis little island in far Eastern seas, ten thousand miles from our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1883 few had ever heard of Krakatoa. It was unknown to\r\nfame, as are hundreds of other gems of glorious vegetation set in\r\ntropical waters. It was not inhabited, but the natives from the\r\nsurrounding shores of Sumatra and Java used occasionally to draw their\r\ncanoes up on its beach, while they roamed through the jungle in search\r\nof the wild fruits that there abounded. Geographers in early days hardly\r\ncondescended to notice Krakatoa; the name of the island on their maps\r\nwould have been far longer than the island itself. It was known to the\r\nmariner who navigated the Straits of Sunda, for it was marked on his\r\ncharts as one of the perils of the intricate navigation in those waters.\r\nIt was no doubt recorded that the locality had been once, or more than\r\nonce, the seat of an active volcano. In fact, the island seemed to owe\r\nits existence to some frightful eruption of bygone days; but for a\r\ncouple of centuries there had been no fresh outbreak. It almost seemed\r\nas if Krakatoa might be regarded as a volcano that had become extinct.\r\nIn this respect it would only be like many other similar objects all\r\nover the globe, or the countless extinct volcanoes all over the moon.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Krakatoa suddenly sprang into notoriety. Insignificant though it\r\nhad hitherto seemed, the little island was soon to compel by its tones\r\nof thunder the whole world to pay it instant attention. It was to become\r\nthe scene of a volcanic outbreak so appalling that it is destined to be\r\nremembered throughout the ages. In the spring of that year there were\r\nsymptoms that the volcanic powers in Krakatoa were once more about to\r\nawake from the slumber that had endured for many generations. Notable\r\nwarnings were given. Earthquakes were felt, and deep rumblings proceeded\r\nfrom the earth, showing that some disturbance was in preparation, and\r\nthat the old volcano was again to burst forth after its long period of\r\nrest. At first the eruption did not threaten to be of any serious type;\r\nin fact, the good people of Batavia, so far from being terrified at what\r\nwas in progress in Krakatoa, thought the display was such an attraction\r\nthat they chartered a steamer and went forth for a pleasant picnic to\r\nthe island. Many of us, I am sure, would have been delighted to have\r\nbeen able to join the party who were to witness so interesting a\r\nspectacle. With cautious steps the more venturesome of the excursion\r\nparty clambered up the sides of the volcano, guided by the sounds which\r\nwere issuing from its summit. There they beheld a vast column of steam\r\npouring forth with terrific noise from a profound opening about thirty\r\nyards in width.\r\n\r\nAs the summer of this dread year advanced the vigour of Krakatoa\r\nsteadily increased, the noises became more and more vehement; these were\r\npresently audible on shores ten miles distant, and then twenty miles\r\ndistant; and still those noises waxed louder and louder, until the great\r\nthunders of the volcano, now so rapidly developing, astonished the\r\ninhabitants that dwelt over an area at least as large as Great Britain.\r\nAnd there were other symptoms of the approaching catastrophe. With each\r\nsuccessive convulsion a quantity of fine dust was projected aloft into\r\nthe clouds. The wind could not carry this dust away as rapidly as it was\r\nhurled upwards by Krakatoa, and accordingly the atmosphere became\r\nheavily charged with suspended particles. A pall of darkness thus hung\r\nover the adjoining seas and islands. Such was the thickness and the\r\ndensity of these atmospheric volumes of Krakatoa dust that, for a\r\nhundred miles around, the darkness of midnight prevailed at midday. Then\r\nthe awful tragedy of Krakatoa took place. Many thousands of the\r\nunfortunate inhabitants of the adjacent shores of Sumatra and Java were\r\ndestined never to behold the sun again. They were presently swept away\r\nto destruction in an invasion of the shore by the tremendous waves with\r\nwhich the seas surrounding Krakatoa were agitated.\r\n\r\nGradually the development of the volcanic energy proceeded, and\r\ngradually the terror of the inhabitants of the surrounding coasts rose\r\nto a climax. July had ended before the manifestations of Krakatoa had\r\nattained their full violence. As the days of August passed by the spasms\r\nof Krakatoa waxed more and more vehement. By the middle of that month\r\nthe panic was widespread, for the supreme catastrophe was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—SHOWING COASTS INVADED BY THE GREAT SEA-WAVES\r\nFROM KRAKATOA.\r\n(_From the Royal Society’s Reports._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of Sunday, August 26th, 1883, the blackness of the\r\ndust-clouds, now much thicker than ever in the Straits of Sunda and\r\nadjacent parts of Sumatra and Java, was only occasionally illumined by\r\nlurid flashes from the volcano. The Krakatoan thunders were on the point\r\nof attaining their complete development. At the town of Batavia, a\r\nhundred miles distant, there was no quiet that night. The houses\r\ntrembled with the subterranean violence, and the windows rattled as if\r\nheavy artillery were being discharged in the streets. And still these\r\nefforts seemed to be only rehearsing for the supreme display. By ten\r\no’clock on the morning of Monday, August 27th, 1883, the rehearsals were\r\nover and the performance began. An overture, consisting of two or three\r\nintroductory explosions, was succeeded by a frightful convulsion which\r\ntore away a large part of the island of Krakatoa and scattered it to the\r\nwinds of heaven. In that final effort all records of previous explosions\r\non this earth were completely broken.\r\n\r\nThis supreme effort it was which produced the mightiest noise that, so\r\nfar as we can ascertain, has ever been heard on this globe. It must have\r\nbeen indeed a loud noise which could travel from Krakatoa to Batavia and\r\npreserve its vehemence over so great a distance; but we should form a\r\nvery inadequate conception of the energy of the eruption of Krakatoa if\r\nwe thought that its sounds were heard by those merely a hundred miles\r\noff. This would be little indeed compared with what is recorded, on\r\ntestimony which it is impossible to doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EARLY STAGE OF THE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA.\r\n(_From a Photograph taken on May 27th, 1883._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWestward from Krakatoa stretches the wide expanse of the Indian Ocean.\r\nOn the opposite side from the Straits of Sunda lies the island of\r\nRodriguez, the distance from Krakatoa being almost three thousand miles.\r\nIt has been proved by evidence which cannot be doubted that the booming\r\nof the great volcano attracted the attention of an intelligent\r\ncoastguard on Rodriguez, who carefully noted the character of the sounds\r\nand the time of their occurrence. He had heard them just four hours\r\nafter the actual explosion, for this is the time the sound occupied on\r\nits journey.\r\n\r\nWe shall better realise the extraordinary vehemence of this tremendous\r\nnoise if we imagine a similar event to take place in localities more\r\nknown to most of us than are the far Eastern seas.\r\n\r\nIf Vesuvius were vigorous enough to thunder forth like Krakatoa, how\r\ngreat would be the consternation of the world! Such a report might be\r\nheard by King Edward at Windsor, and by the Czar of all the Russias at\r\nMoscow. It would astonish the German Emperor and all his subjects. It\r\nwould penetrate to the seclusion of the Sultan at Constantinople. Nansen\r\nwould still have been within its reach when he was furthest north, near\r\nthe Pole. It would have extended to the sources of the Nile, near the\r\nEquator. It would have been heard by Mohammedan pilgrims at Mecca. It\r\nwould have reached the ears of exiles in Siberia. No inhabitant of\r\nPersia would have been beyond its range, while passengers on half the\r\nliners crossing the Atlantic would also catch the mighty reverberation.\r\n\r\nThe subject is of such exceptional interest that I may venture on\r\nanother illustration. Let us suppose that a similar earth-shaking event\r\ntook place in a central position in the United States. Let us say, for\r\nexample, that an explosion occurred at Pike’s Peak as resonant as that\r\nfrom Krakatoa. It would certainly startle not a little the inhabitants\r\nof Colorado far and wide. The ears of dwellers in the neighbouring\r\nStates would receive a considerable shock. With lessening intensity the\r\nsound would spread much further around—indeed, it might be heard all\r\nover the United States. The sonorous waves would roll over to the\r\nAtlantic coast, they would be heard on the shores of the Pacific.\r\nFlorida would not be too far to the south, nor Alaska too remote to the\r\nnorth. If, indeed, we could believe that the sound would travel as\r\nfreely over the great continent as it did across the Indian Ocean, then\r\nwe may boldly assert that every ear in North America might listen to the\r\nthunder from Pike’s Peak, if it rivalled Krakatoa. The reverberation\r\nmight even be audible by skin-clad Eskimos amid the snows of Greenland,\r\nand by naked Indians sweltering on the Orinoco. Can we doubt that\r\nKrakatoa made the greatest noise that has ever been recorded?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—SPREAD OF THE AIR-WAVE FROM KRAKATOA TO THE\r\nANTIPODES.\r\n(_From the Royal Society’s Reports._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many other incidents connected with this explosion, I may\r\nspecially mention the wonderful system of divergent ripples that started\r\nin our atmosphere from the point at which the eruption took place. I\r\nhave called them ripples, from the obvious resemblance which they bear\r\nto the circular expanding ripples produced by raindrops which fall upon\r\nthe still surface of water. But it would be more correct to say that\r\nthese objects were a series of great undulations which started from\r\nKrakatoa and spread forth in ever-enlarging circles through our\r\natmosphere. The initial impetus was so tremendous that these waves\r\nspread for hundreds and thousands of miles. They diverged, in fact,\r\nuntil they put a mighty girdle round the earth, on a great circle of\r\nwhich Krakatoa was the pole. The atmospheric waves, with the whole earth\r\nnow well in their grasp, advanced into the opposite hemisphere. In their\r\nfurther progress they had necessarily to form gradually contracting\r\ncircles, until at last they converged to a point in Central America, at\r\nthe very opposite point of the diameter of our earth, eight thousand\r\nmiles from Krakatoa. Thus the waves completely embraced the earth. Every\r\npart of our atmosphere had been set into a tingle by the great eruption.\r\nIn Great Britain the waves passed over our heads, the air in our\r\nstreets, the air in our houses, trembled from the volcanic impulse. The\r\nvery oxygen supplying our lungs was responding also to the supreme\r\nconvulsion which took place ten thousand miles away. It is needless to\r\nobject that this could not have taken place because we did not feel it.\r\nSelf-registering barometers have enabled these waves to be followed\r\nunmistakably all over the globe.\r\n\r\nSuch was the energy with which these vibrations were initiated at\r\nKrakatoa, that even when the waves thus arising had converged to the\r\npoint diametrically opposite in South America their vigour was not yet\r\nexhausted. The waves were then, strange to say, reflected back from\r\ntheir point of convergence to retrace their steps to Krakatoa. Starting\r\nfrom Central America, they again described a series of enlarging\r\ncircles, until they embraced the whole earth. Then, advancing into the\r\nopposite hemisphere, they gradually contracted until they had regained\r\nthe Straits of Sunda, from which they had set forth about thirty-six\r\nhours previously. Here was, indeed, a unique experience. The air-waves\r\nhad twice gone from end to end of this globe of ours. Even then the\r\natmosphere did not subside until, after some more oscillations of\r\ngradually fading intensity, at last they became evanescent.\r\n\r\nBut, besides these phenomenal undulations, this mighty incident at\r\nKrakatoa has taught us other lessons on the constitution of our\r\natmosphere. We previously knew little, or I might almost say nothing, as\r\nto the conditions prevailing above the height of ten miles overhead. We\r\nwere almost altogether ignorant of what the wind might be at an altitude\r\nof, let us say, twenty miles. It was Krakatoa which first gave us a\r\nlittle information which was greatly wanted. How could we learn what\r\nwinds were blowing at a height four times as great as the loftiest\r\nmountain on the earth, and twice as great as the loftiest altitude to\r\nwhich a balloon has ever soared? We could neither see these winds nor\r\nfeel them. How, then, could we learn whether they really existed? No\r\ndoubt a straw will show the way the wind blows, but there are no straws\r\nup there. There was nothing to render the winds perceptible until\r\nKrakatoa came to our aid. Krakatoa drove into those winds prodigious\r\nquantities of dust. Hundreds of cubic miles of air were thus deprived of\r\nthat invisibility which they had hitherto maintained. They were thus\r\ncompelled to disclose those movements about which, neither before nor\r\nsince, have we had any opportunity of learning.\r\n\r\nWith eyes full of astonishment men watched those vast volumes of\r\nKrakatoa dust start on a tremendous journey. Westward the dust of\r\nKrakatoa took its way. Of course, everyone knows the so-called\r\ntradewinds on our earth’s surface, which blow steadily in fixed\r\ndirections, and which are of such service to the mariner. But there is\r\nyet another constant wind. We cannot call it a trade-wind, for it never\r\nhas rendered, and never will render, any service to navigation. It was\r\nfirst disclosed by Krakatoa. Before the occurrence of that eruption no\r\none had the slightest suspicion that far up aloft, twenty miles over our\r\nheads, a mighty tempest is incessantly hurrying with a speed much\r\ngreater than that of the awful hurricane which once laid so large a part\r\nof Calcutta on the ground, and slew so many of its inhabitants.\r\nFortunately for humanity, this new trade-wind does not come within less\r\nthan twenty miles of the earth’s surface. We are thus preserved from the\r\nfearful destruction that its unintermittent blasts would produce, blasts\r\nagainst which no tree could stand, and which would, in ten minutes, do\r\nas much damage to a city as would the most violent earthquake. When this\r\ngreat wind had become charged with the dust of Krakatoa, then, for the\r\nfirst and, I may add, for the only time, it stood revealed to human\r\nvision. Then it was seen that this wind circled round the earth in the\r\nvicinity of the Equator, and completed its circuit in about thirteen\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nPlease observe the contrast between this wind of which we are now\r\nspeaking and the waves to which we have just referred. The waves were\r\nmerely undulations or vibrations produced by the blow which our\r\natmosphere received from the explosion of Krakatoa, and these waves were\r\npropagated through the atmosphere much in the same way as sound waves\r\nare propagated. Indeed, these waves moved with the same velocity as\r\nsound. But the current of air of which we are now speaking was not\r\nproduced by Krakatoa; it existed from all time, before Krakatoa was ever\r\nheard of, and it exists at the present moment, and will doubtless exist\r\nas long as the earth’s meteorological arrangements remain as they are at\r\npresent. All that Krakatoa did was simply to provide the charges of dust\r\nby which for one brief period this wind was made visible.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1883 the newspapers were full of accounts of strange\r\nappearances in the heavens. The letters containing these accounts poured\r\nin upon us from residents in Ceylon; they came from residents in the\r\nWest Indies, and from other tropical places. All had the same tale to\r\ntell. Sometimes experienced observers assured us that the sun looked\r\nblue; sometimes we were told of the amazement with which people beheld\r\nthe moon draped in vivid green. Other accounts told of curious halos,\r\nand, in short, of the signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, which\r\nwere exceedingly unusual, even if we do not say that they were\r\nabsolutely unprecedented.\r\n\r\nThose who wrote to tell of the strange hues that the sun manifested to\r\ntravellers in Ceylon, or to planters in Jamaica, never dreamt of\r\nattributing the phenomena to Krakatoa, many thousands of miles away. In\r\nfact, these observers knew nothing at the time of the Krakatoa eruption,\r\nand probably few of them, if any, had ever heard that such a place\r\nexisted. It was only gradually that the belief grew that these,\r\nphenomena were due to Krakatoa. But when the accounts were carefully\r\ncompared, and when the dates were studied at which the phenomena were\r\nwitnessed in the various localities, it was demonstrated that these\r\nphenomena, notwithstanding their worldwide distribution, had certainly\r\narisen from the eruption in this little island in the Straits of Sunda.\r\nIt was most assuredly Krakatoa that painted the sun and the moon, and\r\nproduced the other strange and weird phenomena in the tropics.\r\n\r\nAfter a little time we learned what had actually happened. The dust\r\nmanufactured by the supreme convulsion was whirled round the earth in\r\nthe mighty atmospheric current into which the volcano discharged it. As\r\nthe dust-cloud was swept along by this incomparable hurricane, it showed\r\nits presence in the most glorious manner by decking the sun and the moon\r\nin hues of unaccustomed splendour and beauty. The blue colour in the sky\r\nunder ordinary circumstances is due to particles in the air, and when\r\nthe ordinary motes of the sunbeam were reinforced by the introduction of\r\nthe myriads of motes produced by Krakatoa, even the sun itself sometimes\r\nshowed a blue tint. Thus the progress of the great dust-cloud was traced\r\nout by the extraordinary sky effects it produced, and from the progress\r\nof the dust-cloud we inferred the movements of the invisible air current\r\nwhich carried it along. Nor need it be thought that the quantity of\r\nmaterial projected from Krakatoa should have been inadequate to produce\r\neffects of this worldwide description. Imagine that the material which\r\nwas blown to the winds of heaven by the supreme convulsion of Krakatoa\r\ncould be all recovered and swept into one vast heap. Imagine that the\r\nheap were to have its bulk measured by a vessel consisting of a cube one\r\nmile long, one mile broad, and one mile deep; it has been estimated that\r\neven this prodigious vessel would have to be filled to the brim at least\r\nten times before all the products of Krakatoa had been measured.\r\n\r\nIt was in the late autumn of 1883 that the marvellous series of\r\ncelestial phenomena connected with the great eruption began to be\r\ndisplayed in Great Britain. Then it was that the glory of the ordinary\r\nsunsets was enhanced by a splendour which has dwelt in the memory of all\r\nthose who were permitted to see them. The frontispiece of this volume\r\ncontains a view of the sunset as seen at Chelsea at 4.40 p.m. on\r\nNovember 26th, 1883. The picture was painted from nature by Mr. W.\r\nAscroft, and is given in the great work on Krakatoa which was published\r\nby the Royal Society. There is not the least doubt that it was the dust\r\nfrom Krakatoa which produced the beauty of those sunsets, and so long as\r\nthat dust remained suspended in our atmosphere, so long were strange\r\nsigns to be witnessed in the heavenly bodies. But the dust which had\r\nbeen borne with unparalleled violence from the interior of the volcano,\r\nthe dust which had been shot aloft by the vehemence of the eruption to\r\nan altitude of twenty miles, the dust which had thus been whirled round\r\nand round our earth for perhaps a dozen times or more in this air\r\ncurrent, which carried it round in less than a fortnight, was endowed\r\nwith no power to resist for ever the law of gravitation which bids it\r\nfall to the earth. It therefore gradually sank downwards. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the great height to which it had been driven, owing to the\r\nimpetuous nature of the current by which it was hurried along, and owing\r\nto the exceedingly minute particles of which it was composed, the act of\r\nsinking was greatly protracted. Not until two years after the original\r\nexplosion had all the particles with which the air was charged by the\r\ngreat eruption finally subsided on the earth.\r\n\r\nAt first there were some who refused to believe that the glory of the\r\nsunsets in London could possibly be due to a volcano in the Straits of\r\nSunda, at a distance from England which was but little short of that of\r\nAustralia. But the gorgeous phenomena in England were found to be\r\nsimultaneous with like phenomena in other places all round the earth.\r\nOnce again the comparison of dates and other circumstances proved that\r\nKrakatoa was the cause of these exceptional and most interesting\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nNor was the incident without a historical parallel, for has not Tennyson\r\ntold us of the call to St. Telemachus—\r\n\r\n            “Had the fierce ashes of some fiery peak\r\n             Been hurl’d so high they ranged about the globe?\r\n             For day by day, thro’ many a blood-red eve,\r\n             In that four-hundredth summer after Christ,\r\n             The wrathful sunset glared....”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                      SPIRAL AND PLANETARY NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\nA Substitute for History—Photograph of the Great Spiral taken at the\r\n    Lick Observatory—Solar System Relations Unimportant—Chaotic\r\n    Nebulæ—Lord Rosse’s Great Discovery—Dr. Roberts’ Photographs—The\r\n    Astonishing Discovery of Professor Keeler—The Perspective of the\r\n    Spirals—The Spiral Nebulæ are not Gaseous—The Spiral is a Nebula in\r\n    an advanced Stage of Development—Character of the Great Nebula in\r\n    Andromeda.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a great college in America a new educational experiment has been\r\ntried with some success. Instead of the instruction in history which\r\nstudents receive in most other institutions, an attempt has been made in\r\nthis college to give instruction in a very different manner, which it is\r\nbelieved will not be of less educational value than the more ordinary\r\nprocesses of teaching. In the course of study to which I am now\r\nreferring the student is invited to consider, not so much the history of\r\nthe development of the Constitution of one particular country, as to\r\nmake a broad survey of the different Constitutions under which the\r\nseveral countries of the world are at this moment governed. The\r\npromoters of this scheme believe that many of the intellectual\r\nadvantages which are ordinarily expected to be gained by the study of\r\nthe history of one country may be secured equally well by studying only\r\nexisting conditions, provided that attention is given to several\r\ncountries which have arrived at different stages of civilisation.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to say how far the study of the existing\r\nConstitutions of France and Germany, America and Australia, Turkey and\r\nIndia, Morocco and Fiji, might be justly used to supersede the study of\r\nEnglish history, it may at least be urged that if we had no annals from\r\nwhich history could be compiled it might be instructive to employ such a\r\nsubstitute for historical studies as is here suggested. This is, indeed,\r\nthe course which we are compelled to take in our study of that great\r\nchapter in earth-history which we are discussing in these pages. It is\r\nobvious from the nature of the case that it can never be possible for us\r\nto obtain direct testimony as to what occurred in the bringing together\r\nof the materials of this globe. We must, therefore, look abroad through\r\nthe universe, and see whether we can find, from the study of other\r\nsystems at present in various stages of their evolution, illustrations\r\nof the incidents which we may presume to have occurred in the early\r\nstages of our own history.\r\n\r\nIf Kant had never lived, if Laplace had never announced his Nebular\r\nTheory, if the discoveries of Sir William Herschel had not been made, I\r\nstill venture to think that a due consideration of the remarkable\r\nphotograph of the famous Great Spiral, which was obtained at the famous\r\nLick Observatory in California, would have suggested the high\r\nprobability of that doctrine which we describe as the Nebular Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—THE GREAT SPIRAL NEBULA (Lick Observatory).\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf an artist thoroughly versed in the great facts of astronomy had been\r\ncommissioned to represent the nebular origin of our system as perfectly\r\nas a highly cultivated yet disciplined imagination would permit, I do\r\nnot think he could have designed anything which could answer the purpose\r\nmore perfectly than does that picture which is now before us. We might\r\nwish indeed that Kant and Laplace and Herschel could have lived to see\r\nthis marvellous natural illustration of their views, for photographs\r\nwere of course unthought of in those days, and, I need hardly say, that\r\nfor any one celestial nebula that could have been known in the times of\r\nLaplace, hundreds are now within the reach of astronomers.\r\n\r\nWe entreat special attention to this picture which Nature has herself\r\ngiven us, and which represents what we may not unreasonably conclude to\r\nbe a system in a state of formation. Let me say at once that our solar\r\nsystem, however imposing it may be from our point of view, is but of\r\ninfinitesimal importance as compared with the system which is here in\r\nthe course of development. It is sometimes urged that it is difficult to\r\nimagine how a system so large as ours could have been produced by\r\ncondensation from a primæval nebula. The best answer is found in the\r\nfact that the Great Spiral now before us may be considered to exhibit at\r\nthis very moment a system in actual evolution, the central body of which\r\nis certainly thousands of times, and not improbably millions of times,\r\ngreater than the sun, and of which the attending planets or other\r\nrevolving bodies, are framed on a scale immensely transcending that of\r\neven Jupiter himself. The details of this remarkable nebula seem to\r\nillustrate those particular features which had been previously assigned\r\nto the primæval nebula of our system, long before any photograph was\r\navailable for the purpose of their study.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Nebula in Orion, to which we have already referred, as well\r\nas in many other similar objects which we might also have adduced, the\r\nnebulous material from which after long ages new systems may be the\r\nresult, was shown in an extremely chaotic state. It was little more than\r\nan irregular stain of light on the sky. But in the picture of the Great\r\nSpiral which is before us (Fig. 28) it is manifest that the evolution of\r\nthe system has reached an advanced stage; such considerable progress has\r\nbeen made in the actual formation that the final form seems to be\r\nshadowed forth. The luminosity is no longer diffused in a chaotic\r\ncondition; it has formed into spirals, and become much condensed at the\r\ncentre and somewhat condensed in other regions. As we now see it, the\r\nobject seems to represent a system much more advanced in its formation\r\nthan any of the other great nebulæ with which we have compared it. In\r\ncomparison with it the evolution of such an object as the Great Nebula\r\nin Orion can hardly be said to have begun. But in the Great Spiral many\r\nportions of the nebula have already become outlined into masses which,\r\nthough still far from resembling the planets in the solar system, have\r\nat least made some approach thereto while the central portions are being\r\ndrawn together, just as we may conceive the great primæval fire-mist to\r\nhave drawn together in the actual formation of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe famous nebula which we are discussing, and which is generally known\r\nas the Great Spiral, is found in the constellation of Canes Venatici,\r\nvery near the end star in the tail of the Great Bear, and one-fourth of\r\nthe way from it to Cor Caroli. It will be easy to find it from the\r\nindication given in the adjoining Fig. 29. As a nebulous spot it is an\r\nobject which can be seen with any moderately good telescope, but to\r\ndetect those details which indicate the spiral structure demands an\r\ninstrument of first-class power. This object had indeed been studied by\r\nmany astronomers before Lord Rosse turned his colossal reflector upon\r\nit. Then it was that the wonderful whirlpool structure was first\r\ndiscovered, and thus the earliest spiral nebula became known.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.—HOW TO FIND THE GREAT SPIRAL NEBULA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days there were few telescopes of great power, and none of\r\nthose instruments appeared able to deal with this nebula sufficiently to\r\nreveal its spiral character. The announcement of the discovery of the\r\nspiral constitution of this object was therefore received with\r\nincredulity by some astronomers, who believed, or professed to believe,\r\nthat the spiral lines of nebulous matter which Lord Rosse described so\r\nfaithfully, existed only in the imagination of the astronomer. Indeed,\r\nin one notable instance, it was alleged that these features were to be\r\nattributed to actual imperfections in the unrivalled telescope. The\r\nincredulity widely prevalent in the middle of the last century about the\r\nexistence of the spiral nebulæ may be paralleled by the incredulity\r\nabout other discoveries in more recent years. When a highly skilled\r\nobserver, using an instrument of adequate power, and, it may be,\r\nenjoying unequalled opportunities for good work, testifies to certain\r\ndiscoveries; when he has employed in the verification of his\r\nobservations the skill and experience that years of practice have\r\nprocured for him, it is futile for those who have not the like\r\nopportunities, either from the want of instruments of adequate power or\r\nfrom climatic difficulties, to deny the truth of discoveries because\r\nthey are not able to verify them. It was absurd for astronomers to\r\nrefuse assent to the great discoveries of Lord Rosse simply because\r\ninstruments inferior to his would not show the spiral structure.\r\n\r\nIn due time, one astronomer after another began to admit that possibly\r\nthe remarkable form which Lord Rosse announced as characteristic of some\r\nnebulæ might not be a mere figment of the imagination. The complete\r\nvindication of Lord Rosse’s great discovery was not, however, attained\r\nuntil that wonderful advance in the arts of astronomy when the\r\nphotographic plate was called in to supplement, or rather vastly to\r\nextend, the powers of the eye. Dr. Isaac Roberts not only showed by a\r\nmagnificent photograph that the Great Spiral discovered by Lord Rosse\r\nwas just as Lord Rosse had described it, he not only showed that the\r\nother spirals announced by Lord Rosse were equally entitled to the name,\r\nbut, with the newly acquired powers that the photographic plate placed\r\nat his disposal, he was able to show that many other nebulæ, which had\r\nbeen frequently observed and had even been sketched, possessed further\r\nfeatures too faint and delicate to be seen by any human eye, even with\r\nthe help of the most powerful telescope. These further features were\r\ndiscovered because they came within the ken of the intensely acute\r\nperception of the photographic plate. On the plate these features which\r\nthe camera showed, were added to those which the eye had already\r\nperceived, and when these additions were made it was not infrequently\r\nfound that the nebula assumed the form of a spiral. But the most\r\nremarkable circumstance has still to be added. Some of the plates\r\nexposed by Dr. Roberts show clear and unmistakable photographs of spiral\r\nnebulæ as exquisite in detail as the Great Spiral itself, but yet so\r\nfaint that they have never been seen by the eye in any telescope\r\nwhatever, though they could not elude the photographic plate. Thus, Dr.\r\nRoberts not only confirmed in the most splendid manner that really great\r\ndiscovery of the spiral nebulæ of which the honour belongs to Lord\r\nRosse, but the eminent photographic astronomer added many other spirals\r\nof the greatest interest to the list of those objects which Lord Rosse\r\nhad himself given.\r\n\r\nThough these discoveries placed the fact of the existence of spiral\r\nnebulæ in an impregnable position, and though they greatly increased the\r\ninterest with which astronomers study such objects, yet another stop had\r\nto be taken before the spiral nebula attained the position of\r\nextraordinary importance as a celestial object which must now be\r\nacknowledged to be its due.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.—A GROUP OF NEBULÆ (_Lord Rosse_). (3440, 3445 in\r\nn.g.c.)\r\n(_From the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already had occasion (page 67) to mention the marvellous\r\ndiscoveries of nebulæ which the lamented Professor Keeler made with the\r\nCrossley Reflector at the Lick Observatory. We have explained that his\r\ndiscoveries have shown the number of nebulæ in the heavens to be\r\nprobably at least twenty times that which previous observations would\r\nhave authorised us in asserting. The mere announcement that 120,000 new\r\nnebulæ were within the reach of a photographic plate attached to the\r\nCrossley Reflector, would, by itself, have been a statement so\r\nremarkable as to command the immediate attention of the scientific\r\nworld. But the interest of even this statement shrinks to unimportance\r\nrelatively to the further fact which Professor Keeler has added. I do\r\nnot know, in the annals of astronomy, a pronouncement of greater\r\ninterest, certainly none of more importance for our present purpose,\r\nthan the statement that of the 120,000 new nebulæ, at least half are\r\nspirals. Here is indeed a stupendous revolution in our knowledge of the\r\ncelestial objects. Fifty years ago Lord Rosse announced the discovery of\r\na spiral nebula, and the existence of this spiral was doubted at first,\r\nthough it was gradually conceded at last. Now we have the announcement,\r\non the unchallenged evidence of the photographic plate itself, that to\r\nall appearances there are at least 60,000 spiral nebulæ in the heavens.\r\nIt is, alas! too true that Professor Keeler did not live long enough to\r\nenumerate all those nebulæ himself, and, indeed, they have not so far\r\nbeen actually counted, but to those who will study Professor Keeler’s\r\npapers, the evidence of the substantial accuracy of the statement is\r\nincontestable.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.—A RAY NEBULA (_Lord Rosse_). (3628 in n.g.c.)\r\n(_From the Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd astonishing as this statement may be, we have still to add that, in\r\nface of the actual facts, it may be regarded as even a moderate estimate\r\nof the abundance of spirals in the universe. We must remember that a\r\nspiral nebula is a flat object with long arms extending from it which\r\nlie nearly in the same plane. If we are actually to see that such an\r\nobject is spiral, it is necessary for it to be turned squarely towards\r\nthe earth. If the object be too much foreshortened, it is quite plain\r\nthat we can hardly expect to detect its spiral character. It is also\r\nobvious if the spiral happens to be turned edgeways towards us, that\r\nthen its spiral form cannot be seen; it would merely appear as what\r\nastronomers often call a ray. In the enumeration of the spirals it is\r\ntherefore only possible for us to include those which happen to be so\r\nfar squarely turned towards the earth as to make their spiral character\r\nunmistakable. We might, therefore, reasonably expect that the numbers of\r\nspiral nebulæ actually counted would fall short of the reality. We know\r\nthat there are many nebulæ of a somewhat elliptical shape (Fig. 31).\r\nThere are also many nebulæ that look like long rays (Fig. 30). Those who\r\nare familiar with the appearance of nebulæ in great telescopes will\r\nrecall at once the numerous spindle-shaped objects of this class. It can\r\nhardly be doubted that many of the nebulæ, more or less oval in form,\r\nand also these rays or the spindle-shaped objects so frequently seen in\r\ngood telescopes (Fig. 33) are in reality spiral nebulæ, which are turned\r\nnot squarely towards us, but which we are merely looking at more or less\r\nedgewise, so that they have been foreshortened enough to hide their\r\npeculiar structure (Figs. 34, 35). Taking these considerations into\r\naccount, it becomes obvious that the estimate of Professor Keeler as to\r\nthe number of spiral nebulæ in the heavens, vast as that estimate seems,\r\nmay still fall short of the truth. Thus we are led to one of the most\r\nremarkable conclusions of modern astronomy, viz. that the spiral nebula,\r\nnext to a star itself, is the most characteristic object in the sidereal\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the nebulæ in Chapter IV. we explained those fundamental\r\nfeatures of the different spectra which make it possible to discriminate\r\nwith confidence between a nebula which is purely gaseous and a nebula\r\nwhich cannot be so described. As the spiral nebulæ form a class\r\ncharacterised among all the other nebulæ by the possession of a very\r\nparticular structure, it is interesting to enquire what evidence the\r\nspectrum gives with regard to the nature of the material which enters\r\ninto the constitution of the nebulæ which belong to this strongly-marked\r\ngroup. I do not mean to say that all the 60,000 spirals have been\r\nexamined with the spectroscope, but, as already explained on page 67, a\r\nsufficient number have been examined to decide the question. We learn\r\nfrom Professor Scheiner, a well-known authority on astronomical\r\nspectroscopy, that the spectra of spirals are generally found to be\r\ncontinuous; in other words, we learn that a spiral nebula is not\r\ngaseous. It does not consist, like, for example, the nebula in Orion, of\r\nvaporous matter in a state of incandescence.\r\n\r\nA nebula or a nebulous-looking object which does not give a spectrum of\r\nbright lines, but which does give a continuous spectrum, is not\r\ninfrequently set down as being merely a cluster of stars. This is\r\nundoubtedly a true statement with regard to some of these nebulous\r\nobjects, but it is not true with regard to all. It is much more\r\nreasonable to suppose that the greater part of the materials of the\r\nspiral nebulæ, though certainly not in the form of gas, are still not\r\ncondensed into objects large enough to entitle them to be called stars.\r\nIt must be remembered that when an object of a gaseous nature has lost\r\nheat by radiation, and has begun to draw itself together, the gas\r\ncondenses into particles which constitute small portions of liquid or\r\nsolid, just as the vapour of water in the atmosphere condenses into the\r\nbeads of water that form the clouds in our own sky. These small objects,\r\neven if incandescent, would no longer radiate light with the\r\ncharacteristics of a gaseous nebula. The light they would emit would be\r\nof the same character as that dispensed from the particles of carbon in\r\nthe solar photosphere to which the sun owes its light. Radiation from\r\nsuch a source would give light with a continuous spectrum, like that\r\nfrom the sun or a star.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the spectra of the spiral nebulæ are continuous, we\r\nmay infer that, though these nebulæ have reached an advanced stage in\r\ntheir development, they have not always, and, perhaps, not generally,\r\nattained to the stage in which condensation transformed them into a\r\ncluster of actual stars. They have, however, reached a stage in their\r\nprogress towards those systems of large bodies that they are ultimately\r\nto become. The character of its spectrum may show us that the spiral\r\nnebula is not very young, that it has attained a considerable age in its\r\nevolution as compared with other nebulæ which do not show the spiral\r\ncharacter and which have a gaseous spectrum. The importance of this\r\nconsideration will be made apparent in the next chapter, when we discuss\r\nthe dynamical conditions to which a spiral nebula must submit.\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason to doubt that some of the spiral nebulæ may be in\r\nreality star-clusters, in which there are aggregations of myriads of\r\npoints, each justly entitled by its dimensions and its lustre to be\r\nregarded as a real star. The great nebula in Andromeda seems to be a\r\ngreatly foreshortened spiral. This, at least, is the interpretation\r\nwhich may perhaps be most reasonably given to Dr. Roberts’ famous\r\nphotograph of this splendid object. The spectrum of the Andromeda nebula\r\nhas been photographed by Scheiner after a protracted exposure of seven\r\nand a half hours. That spectrum showed no trace of bright lines, thus\r\nproving that there is no discernible incandescent gas in the nebula of\r\nAndromeda. It gives practically a continuous spectrum, across which some\r\nbroad bands can be recognised. It was interesting to compare this\r\nspectrum of the great nebula in Andromeda with the solar spectrum seen\r\nby the same apparatus and under the same conditions. Professor Scheiner\r\nannounces that there was a remarkable coincidence between the two, and\r\nhe draws the inference that the stars which enter into the nebula in\r\nAndromeda are stars of that particular type to which the sun belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.—PORTION OF THE MILKY WAY (NEAR MESSIER II.).\r\n(_Photographed by Professor E. E. Barnard._)\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we have now to point out how the recent study of nebulæ has afforded\r\na yet more striking confirmation of the nebular theory. Laplace showed\r\nhow a gradually condensing nebula might have formed a sun and a system\r\nof planets. Had Laplace known of the spiral nebulæ he would, I doubt\r\nnot, have found in them the most striking illustration of the operation\r\nof evolution on a gigantic scale. They would have provided him with\r\nadmirable arguments in support of the nebular theory. It is possible\r\nthat they might also have provided suggestions as to the details of the\r\nevolution, which he had not anticipated. But Laplace did not know of\r\nsuch objects, and we can only deplore the loss of the instructive\r\nlessons which his incomparable genius would have derived from them.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, admit that the lessons as to the origin of the solar\r\nsystem, derived from the spiral nebulæ, must be received with due\r\nlimitation. We may say at once that the _great_ spiral nebulæ do not\r\nappear to be evolving into systems like the sun and planets; their work\r\nis of a higher order of magnitude altogether. The great spiral nebulæ\r\nseem to be more analogous to galaxies, like the Milky Way (Fig. 32),\r\nthan to solar systems. The spiral nebula instead of being described as a\r\nsystem, should perhaps be described as a system of systems. If the solar\r\nsystem were drawn to scale on the photograph of the Great Spiral (Fig.\r\n28) the orbit of Neptune would not be larger than the smallest\r\nrecognisable dot.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                          THE UNERRING GUIDE.\r\n\r\nThe Solar System—Orbits nearly Plane—Satellites, Saturn’s Ring, Spiral\r\n    Nebulæ—An Explanation of this Tendency of a System towards\r\n    Flatness—The Energy of a System—Loss of Energy by Collision and\r\n    Tidal Action—A System within a System—Movements of Translation and\r\n    Movements of Rotation—The General Law of Conservation of Moment of\r\n    Momentum—Illustrations of the Principle—The Conception of the\r\n    Principal Plane—The Utility of this principle arises from its\r\n    independence of Collisions or Friction—Nature does not do Things\r\n    infinitely Improbable—The Decline of Energy and the Preservation of\r\n    Moment of Momentum—Explanation of the Motions in one Plane and in\r\n    the same Direction—The Satellites of Uranus—The Rotation of\r\n    Uranus—Why the Orbits are not exactly in the same Plane—The\r\n    Evolution of a Nebula—The Inevitable Tendency towards the Spiral—The\r\n    Explanation of the Spiral.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have to consider in this chapter the light which the laws of\r\nmathematics throw upon certain features which are possessed by a very\r\nlarge number of celestial objects. Let us first describe, as clearly as\r\nthe circumstances will permit, the nature of these common features to\r\nwhich we now refer, and of which mathematics will suggest the\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin with our solar system, in which the earth describes an\r\norbit around the sun. That orbit is contained within a plane, which\r\nplane passes through the centre of the sun. We may neglect for the\r\npresent the earth’s occasional slight deviations from this plane which\r\nare caused by the attractions of the other planets. If we consider the\r\nother bodies of our system, such, for instance, as Venus or Jupiter, we\r\nfind that the orbit of Venus also lies in a plane, and that plane also\r\npasses through the centre of the sun. The orbit of Jupiter is found to\r\nbe contained within a plane, and it, too, passes through the sun’s\r\ncentre. Each of the remaining planets in like manner is found to revolve\r\nin an orbit which is contained in a plane, and all these planes have one\r\ncommon point, that point being the centre of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the mutual inclinations are very small, so\r\nthat the several planes are nearly coincident. If we take the plane of\r\nour earth’s orbit, which we call the ecliptic, as the standard, then the\r\ngreatest inclination of the orbit of any other important planet is seven\r\ndegrees, which is found in the case of Mercury. The inclinations to the\r\necliptic of the planes of the orbits of a few of the asteroids are much\r\nmore considerable; to take an extreme case, the orbit of Pallas is\r\ninclined at an angle of no less than thirty-four degrees. It must,\r\nhowever, be remembered that the asteroids are very small objects, as the\r\ncollective masses of the five hundred which are at present known would\r\namount to no more than an unimportant fraction of the mass of one of the\r\ngreat planets of our system. Three-fourths of the asteroids have\r\ninclinations under ten degrees. We may, therefore, leave these bodies\r\nout of consideration for the present, though we may find occasion to\r\nrefer to them again later on. Still less need we pay attention at\r\npresent to the comets, for though these bodies belong to our system, and\r\nthough they move in plane orbits, which like the orbits of the planets\r\npass through the centre of the sun, yet their orbits are inclined at\r\nangles of very varying magnitudes. Indeed, we cannot detect any tendency\r\nin the orbits of comets to approximate to the plane of the ecliptic. The\r\nmasses of comets are, however, inconsiderable in comparison with the\r\nrobust globes which form the planets, while the origin of comets has\r\nbeen apparently so different from that of the planets, that we may leave\r\nthem out of consideration in our present argument. There is nothing in\r\nthe motion of either asteroids or comets to invalidate the general\r\nproposition which affirms, that the planes of the orbits of the heaviest\r\nand most important bodies in the solar system are very nearly\r\ncoincident.\r\n\r\nMany of the planets are accompanied by satellites, and these satellites\r\nrevolve round the planets, just as the planet accompanied by its\r\nsatellites revolves round the sun. The orbit of each satellite is\r\ncontained within a plane, and that plane passes through the centre of\r\nthe planet to which it is appended. We thus have a system of planes\r\nappropriate to the satellites, just as there is a system of planes\r\nappropriate to the planets. The orbits of the satellites of each planet\r\nare very nearly in the same plane, with notable exceptions in the cases\r\nof Uranus and Neptune, which it will be necessary to consider at full\r\nlength later on. This plane is very nearly coincident with the planes in\r\nwhich the planets themselves move. Omitting the exceptions, which are\r\nunimportant as to magnitude, though otherwise extremely interesting and\r\ninstructive, the fundamental characteristic of the movements of the\r\nprincipal bodies in our system is that their orbits are nearly parallel\r\nto the same plane. We draw an average plane through these closely\r\nadjacent planes and we term it the principal plane of our system. It is\r\nnot, indeed, coincident with the plane of the orbit of any one planet,\r\nyet the actual plane of the orbit of every important planet, and of the\r\nimportant satellites, lies exceedingly close to this principal plane.\r\nThis is a noteworthy circumstance in the arrangement of the planetary\r\nsystem, and we expect that it must admit of some physical explanation.\r\n\r\nWhen we look into the details of the planetary groups composing the\r\nsolar system, we find striking indications of the tendency of the orbits\r\nof the bodies in each subordinate system to become adjusted to a plane.\r\nThe most striking instance is that exhibited by the Rings of Saturn. It\r\nhas been demonstrated that these wonderful rings are composed of myriads\r\nof separate particles. Each of these particles follows an independent\r\norbit round Saturn. Each such orbit is contained in a plane, and all\r\nthese planes appear, so far as our observations go, to be absolutely\r\ncoincident. It is further to be noted that the plane, thus remarkably\r\nrelated to the system of rings revolving around Saturn, is substantially\r\nidentical with the plane in which the satellites of Saturn themselves\r\nrevolve, and this plane again is inclined at an angle no greater than\r\ntwenty-eight degrees to the plane of the ecliptic, and close to that in\r\nwhich Saturn itself revolves around the sun.\r\n\r\nOverlooking, as we may for the present, the varieties in detail which\r\nsuch natural phenomena present, we may say that the most noticeable\r\ncharacteristic of the revolutions in the solar system is expressed by\r\nthe statement that they lie approximately in the same plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.—A SPIRAL NEBULA SEEN EDGEWISE (n.g.c. 3628; in\r\nLeo).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall also find that this tendency of the movements in a system to\r\nrange themselves in orbits which lie in the same plane, is exhibited in\r\nother parts of the universe. Let us consider from this point of view the\r\nspiral nebulæ, those remarkable objects which, in the last chapter, we\r\nhave seen to be so numerous and so characteristic. It is obvious that a\r\nspiral nebula must be a flat object. Its thickness is small in\r\ncomparison with its diameter. When a spiral nebula is looked at edgewise\r\n(Fig. 45), then it seems long and thin, so much so that it presents the\r\nappearance of a ray such as we have shown in Fig. 33, which represents a\r\ntype of object very familiar to those astronomers who are acquainted\r\nwith nebulæ. The characteristics of these objects seem consistent only\r\nwith the supposition that there is a tendency in the materials which\r\nenter into a spiral nebula to adapt their movements to a particular\r\nplane, just as there is a tendency for the objects in Saturn’s ring to\r\nremain in a particular plane, and just as there has been a tendency\r\namong the bodies belonging to the solar system themselves to revolve in\r\na particular plane. Remembering also that there seems excellent reason\r\nto believe that spiral nebulæ exhibiting this characteristic are to be\r\nreckoned in scores of thousands, it is evident that the fundamental\r\nfeature in which they all agree must be one of very great importance in\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.—A FORESHORTENED SPIRAL (n.g.c. 3198; in Ursa\r\nMajor).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.—EDGE VIEW OF A SPIRAL BOLDLY SHOWN (n.g.c. 4565;\r\nin Coma Berenices).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may mention yet one more illustration of the remarkable tendency, so\r\nfrequently exhibited by an organised system in space, to place its parts\r\nultimately in or near the same plane, or at all events, to assume a\r\nshape of which one dimension is small in comparison with the two others.\r\nWe have, in the last chapter, referred to the Milky Way, and we have\r\nalluded to the significance of the obvious fact that, however the mass\r\nof stars which form the Milky Way may be arranged, they are so disposed\r\nthat the thickness of the mass is certainly much less than its two other\r\ndimensions. Herschel’s famous illustration of a grindstone to represent\r\nthe shape of the Milky Way will serve to illustrate the form we are now\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\nWhen we meet with a characteristic form so widely diffused through the\r\nuniverse, exhibited not only in the systems attending on the single\r\nplanets, not only in the systems of planets which revolve round a single\r\nsun, but also in that marvellous aggregation of innumerable suns which\r\nwe find in the Milky Way, and in scores of thousands of nebulæ in all\r\ndirections, at all distances, and apparently of every grade of\r\nimportance, we are tempted to ask whether there may not be some physical\r\nexplanation of a characteristic so universal and so remarkable.\r\n\r\nLet us see whether mathematics can provide any suggestion as to the\r\ncause of this tendency towards flatness which seems to affect those\r\nsystems in the universe which are sufficiently isolated to escape from\r\nany large disturbance of their parts by outside interference. We must\r\nbegin by putting, as it were, the problem into shape, and by enumerating\r\ncertain conditions which, though they may not be absolutely fulfilled in\r\nnature, are often so very nearly fulfilled that we make no appreciable\r\nerror by supposing them to be so.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a myriad bodies of various sizes, shapes, materials\r\nand masses, are launched in space in any order whatever, at any\r\ndistances from each other, and that they are started with very different\r\nmovements. Some may be going very fast, some going slowly, or not at\r\nall; some may be moving up or down or to the right or to the left—there\r\nmay be, in fact, every variety in their distances and their velocities,\r\nand in the directions in which they are started.\r\n\r\nWe assume that each pair of masses attract each other by the well-known\r\nlaw of gravitation, which expresses that the force between any two\r\nbodies is proportional directly to the product of their masses and\r\ninversely to the square of their distance. We have one further\r\nsupposition to make, and it is an important one. We shall assume that\r\nthough each one of the bodies which we are considering is affecting all\r\nthe others, and is in turn affected by them, yet that they are subjected\r\nto no appreciable disturbing influence from other bodies not included in\r\nthe system to which they belong. This may seem at first to make the\r\nproblem we are about to consider a purely imaginary one, such as could\r\nonly be applicable to systems different from those which are actually\r\npresented to us in nature. It must be admitted that the condition we\r\nhave inferred can only be approximately fulfilled. But a little\r\nconsideration will show that the supposition is not an unreasonable one.\r\nTake, for instance, the solar system, consisting of the sun, the\r\nplanets, and their satellites. Every one of these bodies attracts every\r\nother body, and the movement of each of the bodies is produced by the\r\njoint effects of the forces exerted upon it by all the others. Assuredly\r\nthis gives a problem quite difficult enough for all the resources that\r\nare at our command. But in such investigations we omit altogether the\r\ninfluence of the stars. Sirius, for example, does exercise some\r\nattraction on the bodies of our system, but owing to its enormous\r\ndistance, in comparison with the distances in our solar system, the\r\neffect of the disturbance of Sirius on the relative movements of the\r\nplanets is wholly inappreciable. Indeed, we may add that the\r\ndisturbances in the solar system produced by all the stars, even\r\nincluding the myriads of the Milky Way, are absolutely negligible. The\r\nmovements in our solar system, so far as our observations reveal them,\r\nare performed precisely as if all bodies of the universe foreign to the\r\nsolar system were non-existent. This consideration shows that in the\r\nproblem we are now to consider, we are introducing no unreasonable\r\nelement when we premise that the system whose movements we are to\r\ninvestigate is to be regarded as free from appreciable disturbance by\r\nany foreign influence.\r\n\r\nTo follow the fortunes of a system of bodies, large or small, starting\r\nunder any arbitrary conditions at the commencement, and then abandoned\r\nto their mutual attractions, is a problem for the mathematician. It\r\ncertainly presents to him questions of very great difficulty, and many\r\nof these he has to confess are insoluble; there are, however, certain\r\nimportant laws which must be obeyed in all the vicissitudes of the\r\nmotion. There are certain theorems known to the mathematician which\r\napply to such a system, and it is these theorems which afford us most\r\ninteresting and instructive information. I am well aware that the\r\nsubject upon which I am about to enter is not a very easy one, but its\r\nimportance is such that I must make the effort to explain it.\r\n\r\nLet me commence by describing what is meant when we speak of the energy\r\nof a system. Take, first, the case of merely two bodies, and let us\r\nsuppose that they were initially at rest. The energy of a system of this\r\nvery simple type is represented by the quantity of work which could be\r\ndone by allowing these two bodies to come together. If, instead of being\r\nin the beginning simply at rest, the bodies had each been in motion, the\r\nenergy of the system would be correspondingly greater. The energy of a\r\nmoving body, or its capacity of doing work in virtue of its movement, is\r\nproportional jointly to its mass and to the square of its velocity. The\r\nenergy of the two moving bodies will therefore be represented by three\r\nparts; first, there will be that due to their distance apart; secondly,\r\nthere will be that due to the velocity of one of them; and, thirdly,\r\nthere is that due to the velocity of the other. In the case of a number\r\nof bodies, the energy will consist in the first place of a part which is\r\ndue to the separation of the bodies, and measured by the quantity of\r\nwork that would be produced if, in obedience to their mutual attraction,\r\nall the bodies were allowed to come together into one mass. In the\r\nsecond place, the bodies are to be supposed to have been originally\r\nstarted with certain velocities, and the energy of each of the bodies,\r\nin virtue of its motion, is to be measured by the product of one-half\r\nits mass into the square of its velocity. The total energy of the system\r\nconsists, therefore, of the sum of the parts due to the velocities of\r\nthe bodies, and that which is due to their mutual separation.\r\n\r\nIf the bodies could really be perfectly rigid, unyielding masses, so\r\nthat they have no movements analogous to tides, and if their movements\r\nbe such that collisions will not take place among them, then the laws of\r\nmechanics tell us that the quantity of energy in that system will remain\r\nfor ever unaltered. The velocities of the particles may vary, and the\r\nmutual distances of the particles may vary, but those variations will be\r\nalways conducted, subject to the fundamental condition that if we\r\nmultiply the square of the velocity of each body by one-half its mass,\r\nand add all those quantities together, and if we increase the sum thus\r\nobtained by the quantity of energy equivalent to the separation of the\r\nparticles, the total amount thus obtained is constant. This is the\r\nfundamental law of mechanics known as the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nFor such material systems as the universe presents to us, the\r\nconservation of energy, in the sense in which I have here expressed it,\r\nwill not be maintained; for the necessary conditions cannot be\r\nfulfilled. Let us suppose that the incessant movements of the bodies in\r\nthe system, rushing about under the influence of their mutual\r\nattractions, has at last been productive of a collision between two of\r\nthe bodies. We have already explained in Chapter VI. how in the\r\ncollision of two masses the energy which they possess in virtue of their\r\nmovements may be to a large extent transformed into heat; there is\r\nconsequently an immediate increase in the temperature of the bodies\r\nconcerned, and then follows the operation of that fundamental law of\r\nheat, by which the excess of heat so arising will be radiated away. Some\r\nof it will, no doubt, be intercepted by falling on other bodies in the\r\nsystem, and the amount that might be thus possibly retained would, of\r\ncourse, not be lost to the system. The bodies of the solar system at\r\nleast are so widely scattered, that the greater part of the heat would\r\ncertainly escape into space, and the corresponding quantity of energy\r\nwould be totally lost to the system. We may generally assume that a\r\ncollision among the bodies would be most certainly productive of a loss\r\nof energy from the system.\r\n\r\nNo doubt collisions can hardly be expected to occur in a system\r\nconsisting of large, isolated bodies like the planets. Even in any\r\nsystem of solid bodies collisions may be presumed to be infrequent in\r\ncomparison with the numbers of the bodies. But if, instead of a system\r\nof few bodies of large mass, we have a gas or nebula composed of\r\ninnumerable atoms or molecules, the collisions would be by no means\r\ninfrequent, and every collision, in so far as it led to the production\r\nof heat, would be productive of loss of energy by radiation from the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt should also be added that, even independently of actual collisions,\r\nthere is, and must be, loss of energy in the system from other causes.\r\nThere are no absolutely rigid bodies known in nature, for the hardest\r\nmineral or the toughest steel must yield to some extent when large\r\nforces are applied to it, and as the bodies in the system are not mere\r\npoints or particles of inconsiderable dimensions, they will experience\r\nstresses something like those to which our earth is subjected in that\r\naction of the moon and sun which produces the tides. In consequence of\r\nthe influences of each body on the rest, there will be certain relative\r\nchanges in the parts of each body; there will be, as it were, tidal\r\nmovements in their liquid parts and even in their solid substance. These\r\ntides will produce friction, and this will produce heat. This heat will\r\nbe radiated from the system, but the heat radiated corresponds to a\r\ncertain amount of energy; the energy is therefore lost to the system, so\r\nthat even without actual collisions we still find that energy must be\r\ngradually lost to the system.\r\n\r\nThus we have been conducted to an important conclusion, which may be\r\nstated in the following way. Let there be any system of bodies, subject\r\nto their mutual attractions, and sufficiently isolated from the\r\ndisturbing influence of all bodies which do not belong to the system,\r\nthen the original energy with which that system is started must be\r\nundergoing a continual decline. It must at least decline until such a\r\ncondition of the system has been reached that collisions are no longer\r\npossible and that tidal influences have ceased. These conditions might\r\nbe fulfilled if all the bodies of the system coalesced into a single\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nAs illustrations of the systems we are now considering, we may take the\r\nsun and planets as a whole. A spiral nebula is a system in the present\r\nsense, while perhaps the grandest illustration of all is provided by the\r\nMilky Way.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that we may have a system which is isolated so far as\r\nour present argument is concerned, even while it forms a part of another\r\nsystem of a higher order of magnitude. For instance, Saturn with his\r\nrings and satellites is sufficiently isolated from the rest of the solar\r\nsystem and the rest of the universe, to enable us to trace the\r\nconsequences of the gradual decline of energy in his attendant system.\r\nThe solar system in which Saturn appears merely as a unit, is itself\r\nsufficiently isolated from the stars in the Milky Way to permit us to\r\nstudy the decline of energy in the solar system, without considering the\r\naction of those stars.\r\n\r\nThis general law of the decline of energy in an isolated system, is\r\nsupplemented by another law often known as the conservation of moment of\r\nmomentum. It may at first seem difficult to grasp the notion which this\r\nlaw involves. The effort is, however, worth making, for the law in\r\nquestion is of fundamental importance in the study of the mechanics of\r\nthe universe. In the Appendix will be found an investigation by\r\nelementary geometry of the important mechanical principles which are\r\ninvolved in this subject.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the origin of the primæval nebula, and whatever\r\nmay have been the forces concerned in its production we may feel\r\nconfident that it was not originally at rest. We do not indeed know any\r\nobject which is at rest. Not one of the heavenly bodies is at rest,\r\nnothing on earth is at rest, for even the molecules of rigid matter are\r\nin rapid motion. Rest seems unknown in the universe. It would be,\r\ntherefore, infinitely improbable that a primæval nebula, whatever may\r\nhave been the agency by which it was started on that career which we are\r\nconsidering, was initially in a condition of absolute rest. We assume\r\nwithout hesitation that the nebula was to some extent in motion, and we\r\nmay feel assured that the motions were of a highly complicated\r\ndescription. It is fortunate for us that our argument does not require\r\nus to know the precise character of the movements, as such knowledge\r\nwould obviously be quite unattainable. We can, however, invoke the laws\r\nof mechanics as an unerring guide. They will tell us not indeed\r\neverything about those motions, but they will set forth certain\r\ncharacteristics which the movements must have had, and these\r\ncharacteristics suffice for our argument.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the important principle on which we are now entering I\r\nmust mention the famous problem of three bodies which has engaged the\r\nattention of the greatest mathematicians. Let there be a body A, and\r\nanother B, and another C. We shall suppose that these bodies are so\r\nsmall that they may be regarded merely as points in comparison with the\r\ndistances by which they are separated. We shall suppose that they are\r\nall moving in the same plane, and we shall suppose that each of them\r\nattracts the others, but that except these attractions there are no\r\nother forces in the system. To discover all about the motions of these\r\nbodies is so difficult a problem that mathematicians have never been\r\nable to solve it. But though we are not able to solve the problem\r\ncompletely, we can learn something with regard to it.\r\n\r\nWe represent by arrows in Fig. 36 the directions in which A, B, and C\r\nare moving at the moment. We choose any point O in the plane, and for\r\nsimplicity we have so drawn the figure that A, B, and C are forces\r\ntending to turn round O in the same direction. The velocity of a body\r\nmultiplied into its mass is termed the _momentum_ of the body. Draw the\r\nperpendicular from O to the direction in which the body A is moving,\r\nthen the product of this perpendicular and the momentum of A is called\r\nthe _moment of momentum_ of A around O. In like manner we form the\r\nmoment of momentum of B and C, and if we add them together we obtain the\r\ntotal moment of momentum of the system.\r\n\r\nWe can now give expression to a great discovery which mathematicians\r\nhave made. No matter how complicated may be the movements of A, B, and\r\nC; no matter to what extent these particles approximate or how widely\r\nthey separate; no matter what changes may occur in their velocities, or\r\neven what actual collision may take place, the sum of the moments of\r\nmomentum must remain for ever unaltered. This most important principle\r\nin dynamics is known as the conservation of moment of momentum.\r\n\r\nThough I have only mentioned three particles, yet the same principle\r\nwill be true for any number. If it should happen that any of them are\r\nturning round O in the opposite direction, then their moments of\r\nmomentum are to be taken as negative. In this case we add the moments\r\ntending in one direction together; and then subtract all the opposite\r\nmoments. The remainder is the quantity which remains constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.—TO ILLUSTRATE MOMENT OF MOMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may state this principle in a somewhat different manner as follows:\r\nLet us consider a multitude of particles in a plane; let them be\r\nseverally started in any directions in the plane, and then be abandoned\r\nto their mutual attractions, it being understood that there are no\r\nforces produced by bodies external to the system; if we then choose any\r\npoint in the plane, and measure the areas described round that point by\r\nthe several moving bodies in one second, and if we multiply each of,\r\nthose areas by the mass of the corresponding body, then, if all the\r\nbodies are moving in the same direction round the point, the sum of the\r\nquantities so obtained is constant. It will be the same a hundred or a\r\nthousand years hence as it is at the present moment, or as it was a\r\nhundred or a thousand years ago. If any of the particles had been\r\nturning round the point in the opposite direction, then the products\r\nbelonging to such particles are to be subtracted from the others instead\r\nof added.\r\n\r\nWe have now to express in a still more general manner the important\r\nprinciple that is here involved. Let us consider any system of\r\nattracting particles, no matter what their masses or whether their\r\nmovements be restricted to a plane or not. Let us start them into motion\r\nin any directions and with any initial velocities, and then abandon them\r\nto the influence of their mutual attractions, withholding at the same\r\ntime the interference of any forces from bodies exterior to the system.\r\nDraw any plane whatever, and let fall perpendiculars upon this plane\r\nfrom the different particles of the system. It will be obvious that as\r\nthe particles move the feet of the perpendiculars must move in\r\ncorrespondence with the particles from which the perpendiculars were let\r\nfall. We may regard the foot of every perpendicular as the actual\r\nposition of a moving point, and it can be proved that if the mass of\r\neach particle be multiplied into the area which the foot of its\r\nperpendicular describes in a second round any point in the plane, and\r\nthen be added to the similar products from all the other particles, only\r\nobserving the proper precautions as to sign, the sum will remain\r\nconstant, _i.e._, in any other second the total quantity arrived at will\r\nbe exactly the same. This is a general law of dynamics. It is not a law\r\nof merely approximate truth, it is a law true with absolute accuracy\r\nduring unlimited periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe actual value of the constant will depend both on the system and on\r\nthe plane. For a given system the constant will differ for the different\r\nplanes which may be drawn, and there will be some planes in which that\r\nsum will be zero. In other words, in those planes the areas described by\r\nthe feet of the perpendiculars, multiplied by the masses of the\r\nparticles which are moving in one way, will be precisely equal to the\r\nsimilar sum obtained from the particles moving in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBut among all possible planes there is one of special significance in\r\nits relation to the system. It is called the “principal plane,” and it\r\nis characterised by the fact that the sum (with due attention to sign)\r\nof the areas described each second by the feet of the perpendiculars,\r\nmultiplied into the masses of the corresponding particle, is greater\r\nthan the like magnitude for any other plane, and is thus a maximum. For\r\nall planes parallel to this principal plane, the result will be, of\r\ncourse, the same; it is the direction of the plane and not its absolute\r\nsituation that is material. We thus see that while this remarkable\r\nquantity is constant in any plane, for all time, yet the actual value of\r\nthat constant depends upon the aspect of the plane; for some planes it\r\nis zero, for others the constant has intermediate values, and there is\r\none plane for which the constant is a maximum. This is the principal\r\nplane, and a knowledge of it is of vital importance in endeavouring to\r\nunderstand the nebular theory. Nor are the principles under\r\nconsideration limited only to a system consisting of sun and planets;\r\nthey apply, with suitable modifications, to many other celestial systems\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nThe instructive character of this dynamical principle will be seen when\r\nwe deduce its consequences. The term “moment of momentum” of a particle,\r\nwith reference to a certain point in a plane, expresses double the\r\nproduct of the rate at which the area is described by the foot of the\r\nperpendicular to this plane, multiplied by the mass of the particle. The\r\nmoment of momentum of the system, with reference to the principal plane,\r\nis a maximum in comparison with all other planes; that moment of\r\nmomentum retains precisely the same value throughout all time, from the\r\nfirst instant the system was started onwards. And it retains this value,\r\nno matter what changes or disturbances may happen in the system,\r\nprovided only that the influence of external forces is withheld. Subject\r\nto this condition, the transformations of the system may be any\r\nwhatever. The several bodies may be forced into wide changes of their\r\norbits, so that there may even be collisions among them; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding those collisions, and notwithstanding the violent\r\nalterations which may be thus produced in the movements of the bodies,\r\nthe moment of momentum will not alter. No matter what tides may be\r\nproduced, even if those tides be so great as to produce disruption in\r\nthe masses and force the orbits to change their character radically, yet\r\nthe moment of momentum will be conserved without alteration.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to notice the fundamental difference between the\r\nprinciple which has been called the conservation of energy in the\r\nsystem, and the conservation of moment of momentum. We have pointed out\r\nthat when collisions take place, part of the energy due to motion is\r\ntransformed into heat, and energy in that form admits of radiation\r\nthrough space, and thus becomes lost to the system, with the result that\r\nthe total energy declines. Even without actual collision, we have shown\r\nhow certain effects of tides, or other consequences of friction,\r\nnecessarily involve the squandering of energy with which the system was\r\noriginally endowed. A system started with a certain endowment of energy\r\nmay conserve that energy indefinitely, if all such actions as collisions\r\nor frictions are absent. If collisions or frictions are present the\r\nsystem will gradually dissipate energy. Our interpretation of the future\r\nof such a system must always take account of this fundamental fact.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, conceivable that the moment of momentum with which a\r\nsystem was originally endowed might have happened to be zero. A system\r\nof particles could be so constructed and so started on their movements\r\nthat their moment of momentum with regard to a certain plane should be\r\nzero. It might happen that the moment of momentum of the system with\r\nregard to a second plane, perpendicular to the former one, should be\r\nalso zero; and, finally, that the moment of momentum of the system with\r\nregard to a third plane perpendicular to each of the other two, should\r\nbe also zero. If these three conditions were found to prevail at the\r\ncommencement, they would prevail throughout the movement, and, more\r\ngenerally still, we may state that in such circumstances the moment of\r\nmomentum of the system would be zero about any plane whatever. There\r\nwould be no principal plane in such a system. We thus note that though\r\nit is inconceivable that a group of mutually attracting bodies should be\r\nstarted into movement without a suitable endowment of energy, it is yet\r\nquite conceivable that a system could be started without having any\r\nmoment of momentum. And if at the beginning the system had no moment of\r\nmomentum, then no matter what may be the future vicissitudes of its\r\nmotion, no moment of momentum can ever be acquired by it to all\r\neternity, so long as the interference of external forces is excluded.\r\n\r\nBut having said this much as to the conceivability of the initiation of\r\na system with no moment of momentum, we now hasten to add that, so far\r\nas Nature is actually concerned, this bare possibility may be set aside\r\nas one which is infinitely improbable. Nature does not do things which\r\nare infinitely improbable, and, therefore, we may affirm that all\r\nmaterial systems, with which we shall have to deal, do possess moment of\r\nmomentum. However the system may have originated, whatever may have been\r\nthe actions of forces by which it was brought into being, we may feel\r\nassured that the system received at its initiation some endowment of\r\nmoment of momentum, as well as of energy. Hence we may conclude that\r\nevery such system as is presented to us in the infinite variety of\r\nNature, must stand in intimate relation to some particular plane, being\r\nthat which is known as the principal plane of moment of momentum. In our\r\neffort to interpret Nature, the physical importance of this fact can\r\nhardly be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nIn a future chapter we shall make some attempt to sketch the natural\r\noperations by which individual systems have been started on their\r\ncareers. Postponing, then, such questions, we propose to deal now with\r\nthe phenomena which the principles of dynamics declare must accompany\r\nthe evolution of a system under the action of the exclusive attraction\r\nof the various parts of that system for each other. The system commences\r\nits career with a certain endowment of energy, with a certain endowment\r\nof moment of momentum, and with a certain principal plane to which that\r\nmoment of momentum is specially related. In the course of the evolution\r\nthrough which, in myriads of ages, the system is destined to pass, the\r\nenergy that it contains will undergo vast loss by dissipation. On the\r\nother hand, the moment of momentum will never vary, and the position of\r\nthe principal plane will remain the same for all time. We have to\r\nconsider what features, connected with the evolution, may be attributed\r\nto the operation of these dynamical laws. We have, in fact, to deduce\r\nthe consequences which seem to follow from the fact that, in consequence\r\nof collisions, and in consequence of friction, an isolated system in\r\nspace must gradually part with its initial store of energy, but that,\r\nnotwithstanding any collisions and any friction, the total moment of\r\nmomentum of the system suffers no abatement.\r\n\r\nAs the system advances in development, we have to deal with a gradual\r\ndecline in the ratio of the original store of energy to the original\r\nstore of moment of momentum. And hence we must expect that a system will\r\nultimately tend towards a form in which, while preserving its moment of\r\nmomentum, it shall do so with such a distribution of the bodies of which\r\nit consists as shall be compatible with a diminishing quantity of\r\nenergy. It is not hard to see that in the course of ages this tends, as\r\none consequence, to make the movements of each of the bodies in the\r\nsystem ultimately approximate to movements in a plane.\r\n\r\nLet us, for simplicity, begin with the case of three attracting\r\nparticles, A, B and C. Let B be started in any direction in the plane L,\r\nand let A be started in an orbit round it, and in the same plane L. Now\r\nlet C be started into motion, in any direction, from some point also in\r\nL. It is certain that the sum of the areas projected parallel to any\r\nplane, which are described in a second by these three bodies, must be\r\nconstant, each of the areas being, as usual, multiplied by the mass of\r\nthe corresponding body. Let us specially consider the plane L in which\r\nthe motions of A and B already lie. It is on this plane that the area\r\ndescribed by C has to be projected. The essential point now to remember\r\nis that the projected area is less than the actual area. It is plain\r\nthat if C has to describe a certain projected area in a certain time,\r\nthe velocity with which C has to move must be greater when C starts off\r\nat an inclination to the plane than would have been necessary if C had\r\nstarted in the plane, other things being the same. Thus we see that, if\r\nthe three bodies were all moving in the same plane, they could, speaking\r\ngenerally, maintain more easily the requisite description of areas, that\r\nis, the requisite moment of momentum with smaller velocities than if\r\nthey were moving in directions which were not so regulated; that is to\r\nsay, the moment of momentum can be kept up with less energy when the\r\nparticles move in the same plane.\r\n\r\nIn a more general manner we see that any system in which the bodies are\r\nmoving in the same plane will, for equal moment of momentum, require\r\nless energy than it would have done had the bodies been moving in\r\ndirections which were not limited to a plane. Thus we are led to the\r\nconclusion that the ultimate result of the collisions and the friction\r\nand the tides, which are caused by the action of one particle on\r\nanother, is to make the movements tend towards the same plane.\r\n\r\nIn this dynamical principle we have in all probability a physical\r\nexplanation of that remarkable characteristic of celestial movements to\r\nwhich we have referred. The solar system possesses less energy in\r\nproportion to its moment of momentum than it would require to have if\r\nthe orbits of the important planets, instead of lying practically in the\r\nsame plane, were inclined at various angles. Whatever may have been the\r\noriginal disposition of the materials forming the solar system, they\r\nmust once have contained much more energy than they have at present. The\r\nmoment of momentum in the principal plane, at the beginning, was not,\r\nhowever, different from the moment of momentum that the system now\r\npossesses. As the energy of the system gradually declined, the system\r\nhas gradually been compelled to adjust itself in such a manner that,\r\nwith the reduced quantity of energy, the requisite moment of momentum\r\nshall still be preserved. This is the reason why, in the course of the\r\nmyriads of ages during which the solar system has been acquiring its\r\npresent form, the movements have gradually become nearly conformed to a\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the principle, now before us, may be seen in a striking\r\nmanner in Saturn’s ring. (Fig. 37.) The particles constituting this\r\nexquisite object, so far as observations have revealed them, seem to\r\npresent to us an almost absolutely plane movement. The fact that the\r\nmovements of the constituents of Saturn’s ring lie in a plane is\r\ndoubtless to be accounted for by the operation of the fundamental\r\ndynamical principle to which we have referred. Saturn, in its great\r\nmotion round the luminary, is, of course, controlled by the sun, yet the\r\nsystem attached to Saturn is so close to that globe as to be attracted\r\nby the sun in a manner which need not here be distinguished from the\r\nsolar attraction on Saturn itself. It follows that the differential\r\naction, so to speak, of the sun on Saturn, and on the myriad objects\r\nwhich constitute its ring, may be disregarded. We are therefore\r\nentitled, as already mentioned, to view Saturn and its system as an\r\nisolated group, not acted upon by any forces exterior to the system. It\r\nis therefore subject to the laws which declare that, though the energy\r\ndeclines, the moment of momentum is to remain unaltered. This it is\r\nwhich has apparently caused the extreme flatness of Saturn’s ring. The\r\nenergy of the rotation of that system has been expended until it might\r\nseem that no more energy has been left than just suffices to preserve\r\nthe unalterable moment of momentum, under the most economical\r\nconditions, so far as energy is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.—SATURN. Drawn by E. M. Antoniadi. (July 30th,\r\n1899.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that one of the innumerable myriads of particles which\r\nconstitute the ring of Saturn were to forsake the plane in which it now\r\nrevolves, and move in an orbit inclined to the present plane. We shall\r\nsuppose that the original track of the orbit was a circle, and we shall\r\nassume that in the new plane to which the motion is transferred the\r\nmotion is also circular. That particle will have still to do its share\r\nof preserving the requisite total moment of momentum, for we are to\r\nsuppose that each of the other particles remains unaltered in its pace\r\nand in the other circumstances of its motion. The aberrant particle will\r\ndescribe, in a second, an area which, for the purpose of the present\r\ncalculation, must be projected upon the plane containing the other\r\nparticles. The area, when projected, must still be as large as the area\r\nthat the particle would have described if it had remained in the plane.\r\nIt is therefore necessary that the area swept over by the particle in\r\nthe inclined plane, in one second, shall be greater than the area which\r\nsufficed in the original plane. This requires the circle in which the\r\nparticle revolves to be enlarged, and this necessitates that its energy\r\nshould be increased. In other words, while the moment of momentum was no\r\ngreater than before, the energy of the system would have to be greater.\r\nWe thus see that inasmuch as the particles forming the rings of Saturn\r\nmove in circles in the same plane, they require a smaller amount of\r\nenergy in the system to preserve the requisite moment of momentum than\r\nwould be required if they moved in circular orbits which were not in the\r\nsame plane. In such a system as Saturn’s ring, in which the particles\r\nare excessively numerous and excessively close together, it may be\r\npresumed that there may once have been sufficient collisions and\r\nfrictions among the particles to cause the exhaustion of energy to the\r\nlowest point at which the moment of momentum would be sustained. In the\r\ncourse of ages this has been accomplished by the remarkable adjustment\r\nof the movements to that plane in which we now find them.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this subject is so great that we shall present the\r\nmatter in a somewhat different manner as follows: We shall simplify the\r\nmatter by regarding the orbits of the planets or other bodies as circles\r\nThe fact that these orbits are ellipses, which are, however, very nearly\r\ncircles, will not appreciably affect the argument.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, suppose a single planet revolving round a fixed sun, in\r\nthe centre. The energy of this system has two parts. There is first the\r\nenergy due to the velocity of the planet, and this is found by taking\r\nhalf the product of the mass of the planet and the square of its\r\nvelocity. The second part of the energy depends, as we have already\r\nexplained, on the distance of the planet from the sun. The planet\r\npossesses energy on account of its situation, for the attraction of the\r\nsun on the planet is capable of doing work. The further the planet is\r\nfrom the sun the larger is the quantity of energy that it possesses from\r\nthis cause. On the other hand, the further the planet is from the sun\r\nthe smaller is its velocity, and the less is the quantity of energy that\r\nit possesses of the first kind. We unite the two parts, and we find that\r\nthe net result may be expressed in the following manner: If a planet be\r\nrevolving in a circular path round the sun, then the total energy of\r\nthat system (apart from any rotation of the sun and planet on their\r\naxes), when added to the reciprocal of the distance between the two\r\nbodies, measured with a proper unit of length, is the same for all\r\ndistances of the same two bodies. This shows the connection between the\r\nenergy and the distance of the planet from the sun.\r\n\r\nThus we see that if the circle is enlarged the energy of the system\r\nincreases. The moment of momentum of the system is proportional to the\r\nsquare root of the distance of the two bodies. If, therefore, the\r\ndistance of the two bodies is increased, the moment of momentum\r\nincreases also.\r\n\r\nIt will illustrate the application of the argument to take a particular\r\ncase in which a system of particles is revolving round a central sun in\r\ncircular orbits, all of which lie in the same plane. Let us suppose\r\nthat, while the moment of momentum of the system of particles is to\r\nremain unaltered, one of the particles is to be shifted into a plane\r\nwhich is inclined at an angle of 60° to the plane of the other orbits;\r\nit can easily be seen that an area in the new plane, when projected down\r\ninto the original plane, will be reduced to half its amount. Hence, as\r\nthe moment of momentum of the whole system is to be kept up, it will be\r\nnecessary for the particle to have a moment of momentum in the circle\r\nwhich it describes in the new plane which is double that which it had in\r\nthe original plane. It follows that the radius of the circle in the new\r\nplane must be four times the radius of the circle which defined the\r\norbit of the particle in the old plane. The energy of the particle in\r\nthis orbit is therefore correspondingly greater, and thus the energy of\r\nthe whole system is increased. This illustrates how a system, in which\r\nthe circular orbits are in different planes, requires more energy for a\r\ngiven moment of momentum than would suffice if the circular orbits had\r\nall been in the same plane. So long as the orbits are in different\r\nplanes there will still remain a reserve of energy for possible\r\ndissipation. But the dissipation is always in progress, and hence there\r\nis an incessant tendency towards a flattening of the system by the\r\nmutual actions of its parts.\r\n\r\nIt may help to elucidate this subject to state the matter as follows:\r\nThe more the system contracts, the faster it must generally revolve;\r\nthis is the universal law when disturbing influences are excluded. Take,\r\nfor instance, the sun, which is at this moment contracting on account of\r\nits loss of heat. In consequence of that contraction it is essential\r\nthat the sun shall gradually turn faster round on its axis. At present\r\nthe sun requires twenty-five days, four hours and twenty-nine minutes\r\nfor each rotation. That period must certainly be diminishing, although\r\nno doubt the rate of diminution is very slow. Indeed, it is too slow for\r\nus to observe; nevertheless, some diminution must be in progress.\r\nApplying the same principle to the primitive nebula, we see, that as the\r\ncontraction of the original volume proceeds, the speed with which the\r\nseveral parts will rotate must increase.\r\n\r\nThe periodic times of the planets are here instructive. The materials\r\nnow forming Jupiter were situated towards the exterior of the nebula, so\r\nthat, as the nebula contracted, it tended to leave Jupiter behind. The\r\nperiod in which Jupiter now revolves round the sun may give some notion\r\nof the period of the rotation of the nebula at the time that it extended\r\nso far as Jupiter. Subsequently to the formation, and the detachment of\r\nJupiter, a body which was henceforth no longer in contact with the\r\nnebula, the latter proceeded further in its contraction. Passing over\r\nthe intermediate stages, we find the nebula contracting until it\r\nextended no further than the line now marked by the earth’s orbit; the\r\nspeed with which the nebula was rotating must have been increasing all\r\nthe time, so that though the nebula required several years to go round\r\nwhen it extended as far as Jupiter, only a fraction of that period was\r\nnecessary when it had reached the position indicated by the earth’s\r\ntrack at the present time. Leaving the earth behind it, just as it had\r\npreviously left Jupiter, the nebula started on a still further\r\ncondensation. It drew in, until at last it reached a further stage by\r\ncontraction into the sun, which rotates in less than a month. Thus the\r\nperiod of Jupiter namely, twelve years, the period of the earth, namely,\r\none year, and the period of the sun, namely, twenty-five days,\r\nillustrate the successive accelerations of the rotation of the nebula in\r\nthe process of contraction. No doubt these statements must be received\r\nwith much qualification, but they will illustrate the nature of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nWe may also here mention the satellites of Uranus, all the more so\r\nbecause it has been frequently urged as an objection to the nebular\r\ntheory that the orbits of the satellites of Uranus lie in a plane which\r\nis inclined at a very large angle; no less than 82° to the general plane\r\nof the solar system. I shall refer in a later chapter to this subject,\r\nand consider what explanation can be offered with regard to the great\r\ninclination of this plane, which is one of the anomalies of our system.\r\nFor the present I merely draw attention to the fact that the movements\r\nof all four satellites of Uranus do actually lie in the same plane,\r\nthough, as already indicated, it stands nearly at right angles to the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newcomb has shown that the four satellites of Uranus revolve\r\nin orbits which are almost exactly circular, and which, so far as\r\nobservation shows, are absolutely in the same plane. From our present\r\npoint of view this is a matter of much interest. Whatever may have been\r\nthe influence by which this plane departs so widely from the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, it seems certain that it must be regarded as having acted\r\nat a very early period in the evolution of the Uranian system; and when\r\nthis system had once started on its course of evolution, the operation\r\nof that dynamical principle to which we have so often referred was\r\ngradually brought to bear on the orbits of the satellites. We have here\r\nanother isolated case resembling that of Saturn and its rings. The\r\nfundamental law ordained that the moment of momentum of Uranus and its\r\nmoons must remain constant, though the total quantity of energy in that\r\nsystem should decline. In the course of ages this has led to the\r\nadjustment of the orbits of the four satellites into the same plane.\r\n\r\nI ought here to mention that the rotation of Uranus on its axis presents\r\na problem which has not yet been solved by telescopic observation. It is\r\nextremely interesting to note that, as a rule, the axes on which the\r\nimportant planets rotate are inclined at no great angles to the\r\nprincipal plane of the solar system. The great distance of Uranus has,\r\nhowever, prevented astronomers from studying the rotation of that planet\r\nin the ordinary manner, by observation of the displacement of marks on\r\nits surface. So far as telescopic observations are concerned, we are\r\ntherefore in ignorance as to the axis about which Uranus revolves. If,\r\nfollowing the analogy of Jupiter, or Saturn, or Mars, or the earth, the\r\nrotation of Uranus was conducted about an axis, not greatly inclined\r\nfrom the perpendicular to the ecliptic, then the rotation of Uranus\r\nwould be about an axis very far from perpendicular to the plane in which\r\nits satellites revolve. The analogy of the other planets seems to\r\nsuggest that the rotation of a planet should be nearly perpendicular to\r\nthe plane in which its satellites revolve. As the question is one which\r\ndoes not admit of being decided by observation, we may venture to remark\r\nthat the necessity for a declining ratio of energy to moment of momentum\r\nin the Uranian system provides a suggestion. The moment of momentum of a\r\nsystem, such as that of Uranus and its satellites, is derived partly\r\nfrom the movements of the satellites and partly from the rotation of the\r\nplanet itself. From the illustrations we have already given, it is plain\r\nthat the requisite moment of momentum is compatible with a comparatively\r\nsmall energy only when the system is so adjusted that the axis of\r\nrotation of the planet is perpendicular to the plane in which the\r\nsatellites revolve, or in other words when the satellites revolve in the\r\nplane of the equator of the planet. We do not expect that this condition\r\nwill be complied with to the fullest extent in any members of the solar\r\nsystem. There is indeed an obvious exception; for the moon, in its\r\nrevolution about the earth, does not revolve exactly in the earth’s\r\nequator. We might, however, expect that the tendency would be for the\r\nmovements to adjust themselves in this manner. It seems therefore likely\r\nthat the direction of the axis of Uranus is perpendicular, or nearly so,\r\nto the plane of the movements of its satellites.\r\n\r\nAt this point we take occasion to answer an objection which may perhaps\r\nbe urged against the doctrine of moment of momentum as here applied. I\r\nhave shown that the tendency of this dynamical principle is to reduce\r\nthe movements towards one plane. It may be objected that if there is\r\nthis tendency, why is it that the movements have not all been brought\r\ninto the same plane exactly? This has been accomplished in the case of\r\nthe bodies forming Saturn’s ring, and perhaps in the satellites of\r\nUranus. But why is it that all the great planets of our solar system\r\nhave not been brought to revolve absolutely in the same plane?\r\n\r\nWe answer that the operations of the forces by which this adjustment is\r\neffected are necessarily extremely slow. The process is still going on,\r\nand it may ultimately reach completion. But it is to be particularly\r\nobserved that the nearer the approach is made to the final adjustment,\r\nthe slower must be the process of adjustment, and the less efficient are\r\nthe forces tending to bring it about. For the purpose of illustrating\r\nthis, we may estimate the efficiency of the forces in flattening down\r\nthe system in the following manner. Suppose that there are two circular\r\norbits at right angles to each other, and that we measure the efficiency\r\nof the action tending to bring the planes to coincide by 100. When the\r\nplanes are at an angle of thirty degrees the efficiency is represented\r\nby 50, and when the inclination is only five degrees the efficiency is\r\nno more than 9, and the efficiency gradually lessens as the angle\r\ndeclines. As the angles of inclination of the planes in the solar system\r\nare so small, we see that the efficiency of the flattening operation in\r\nthe solar system must have dwindled correspondingly. Hence we need not\r\nbe surprised that the final reduction of the orbits into the same plane\r\nhas not yet been absolutely completed.\r\n\r\nCertainly the most numerous, and perhaps the grandest, illustrations of\r\nthe operation of the great natural principles we have been considering\r\nare to be found in the case of the spiral nebulæ. The characteristic\r\nappearance of these objects demands special explanation, and it is to\r\ndynamics we must look for that explanation.\r\n\r\nAs to the original cause of a nebula we shall have something to say in a\r\nfuture chapter. At present we are only considering how, when a nebula\r\nhas come into existence, the action of known dynamical principles will\r\nmould that nebula into form. As an illustration of a nebula, in what we\r\nmay describe as its comparatively primitive shape, we may take the Great\r\nNebula in Orion. This stupendous mass of vaguely diffused vapour may\r\nprobably be regarded as in an early stage when contrasted with the\r\nspirals. We have already shown how the spectroscopic evidence\r\ndemonstrates that the famous nebula is actually a gaseous object. It\r\nstands thus in marked contrast with many other nebulæ which, by not\r\nyielding a gaseous spectrum, seem to inform us that they are objects\r\nwhich have advanced to a further stage in their development than such\r\nmasses of mere glowing gas as are found in the splendid object in Orion.\r\n\r\nThe development of a nebula must from dynamical principles proceed along\r\nthe lines that we have already indicated. We shall assume that the\r\nnebula is sufficiently isolated from surrounding objects in space as to\r\nbe practically free from disturbing influences produced by these\r\nobjects. We shall therefore suppose that the evolution of the nebula\r\nproceeds solely in consequence of the mutual attractions of its various\r\nparts. In its original formation the nebula receives a certain endowment\r\nof energy and a certain endowment of moment of momentum; the mere fact\r\nthat we see the nebula, the fact that it radiates light, shows that it\r\nmust be expending energy, and the decline of the energy will proceed\r\ncontinuously from the formation of the object. The laws of dynamics\r\nassure us that no matter what may be the losses of energy which the\r\nnebula suffers through radiation or through the collisions of its\r\nparticles, or through their tidal actions, or in any way whatever from\r\ntheir mutual actions, the moment of momentum must remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nAs the ages roll by, the nebula must gradually come to dispose itself,\r\nso that the moment of momentum shall be maintained, notwithstanding that\r\nthe energy may have wasted away to no more than a fraction of its\r\noriginal amount. Originally there was, of course, one plane, in which\r\nthe moment of momentum was a maximum. It is what we have called the\r\nprincipal plane of the system, and the evolution tends in the direction\r\nof making the nebula gradually settle down towards this plane. We have\r\nseen that the moment of momentum can be sustained with the utmost\r\neconomy of energy by adjusting the movements of the particles so that\r\nthey all take place in orbits parallel to this plane, and the mutual\r\nattractions of the several parts will gradually tend to bring the planes\r\nof the different orbits into coincidence. Every collision between two\r\natoms, every ray of light sent forth, conduce to the final result. Hence\r\nit is that the nebula gradually tends to the form of a flat plane. This\r\nis the first point to be noticed in the formation of a spiral nebula.\r\n\r\nBut there is a further consideration. As the nebula radiates its light\r\nand its heat, and thus loses its energy, it must be undergoing continual\r\ncontraction. Concurrently with its gradual assumption of a flat form,\r\nthe nebula is also becoming smaller. Here again that fundamental\r\nconception of the conservation of moment of momentum will give us\r\nimportant information. If the nebula contracts, that is to say, if each\r\nof its particles draws in closer to the centre, the orbits of each of\r\nits particles will be reduced. But the quantity of areas to be described\r\neach second must be kept up. We have pointed out that it is infinitely\r\nimprobable the system should have been started without any moment of\r\nmomentum, and this condition of affairs being infinitely improbable, we\r\ndismiss any thought of its occurrence. As the particles settle towards\r\nthe plane, the areas swept out by the movements to the right, and those\r\nareas swept out by the movements to the left, will not be identical;\r\nthere will therefore be a balance on one side, and that balance must be\r\nmaintained without the slightest alteration throughout all time. As the\r\nparticles get closer together, and as their orbits lessen, it will\r\nnecessarily happen that the velocities of the particles must increase,\r\nfor not otherwise can the fundamental principle of the constant moment\r\nof momentum be maintained. And as the system gets smaller and smaller,\r\nby contraction from an original widely diffused nebulosity, like,\r\nperhaps, the nebula in Orion, down to a spiral nebula which may occupy\r\nnot a thousandth or a millionth part of the original volume, the areas\r\nwill be kept up by currents of particles moving in the two opposite ways\r\naround a central point. As the contraction proceeds, the opposing\r\nparticles will occasionally collide, and consequently the tendency will\r\nbe for the predominant side to assert itself more and more, until at\r\nlast we may expect a condition to be reached in which all the movements\r\nwill take place in one direction, and when the sum of the areas\r\ndescribed in a second, by each of the particles, multiplied by their\r\nrespective masses, will represent the original endowment of moment of\r\nmomentum. Thus we find that the whole object becomes ultimately\r\npossessed of a movement of rotation.\r\n\r\nThe same argument will show that the inner parts of the nebula will\r\nrevolve more rapidly than those in the exterior. Thus we find the\r\nwhirlpool structure produced, and thus we obtain an explanation, not\r\nonly of the flatness of the nebula, but also of the spiral form which it\r\npossesses. It is not too much to say that the operation of the causes we\r\nhave specified, if external influence be withheld, tends ultimately to\r\nproduce the spiral, whatever may have been the original form of the\r\nobject. No longer, therefore, need we feel any hesitation in believing\r\nthe assurance of Professor Keeler that out of the one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand nebulæ, at least one-half must be spirals. We have found in\r\ndynamics an explanation of that remarkable type of object which we have\r\nnow reason to think is one of the great fundamental forms of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                   THE EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe Primæval Nebula—A Planetary Nebula—The Progress of its\r\n    Evolution—Unsymmetrical Contraction—Centres of Condensation—The Form\r\n    ultimately assumed—Difference between Small Bodies and Large—Earth\r\n    and Sun—Acceleration of Velocities—Formation of the Subordinate\r\n    Systems—Special Circumstances in the case of the Earth and Moon—Vast\r\n    Scale of the Spirals—Spectra of the Spiral Nebulæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE shall consider in this chapter what we believe to have been the\r\nhistory of that splendid system, formed by the planets under the\r\npresiding control of the sun. The ground over which we have already\r\npassed will prepare us for the famous doctrine that the sun, the planets\r\nand their satellites, together with the other bodies which form the\r\ngroup we call the solar system, have originated from the contraction of\r\na primæval nebula.\r\n\r\nAs the ages rolled by, this great primæval nebula began to undergo\r\nmodification. In accordance with the universal law which we find obeyed\r\nin our laboratories, and which we have reason to believe must be equally\r\nobeyed throughout the whole extent of space, this nebula, if warmer than\r\nthe surrounding space, must begin to radiate forth its heat. We are to\r\nassume that the nebula does not receive heat from other bodies, adequate\r\nto compensate for that which it dissipates by radiation. There is thus a\r\nloss of heat and consequently the nebula must begin to contract. Its\r\nmaterial must gradually draw together, and must do so under the\r\noperation of those fundamental laws which we have explained in the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe contraction, or rather the condensation, of the material would of\r\ncourse generally be greatest at the central portion of the nebula. This\r\nis especially noticeable in the photograph of the great spiral already\r\nreferred to. But in addition to this special condensation at the centre,\r\nthe concentration takes place also, though in a lesser degree, at many\r\nother points throughout the whole extent of the glowing mass. Each\r\ncentre of condensation which in this way becomes established tends\r\ncontinually to increase. In consequence of this law, as the great nebula\r\ncontracted and as the great bulk of the material drew in towards the\r\ncentre, there were isolated regions in the nebula which became\r\nsubordinate centres of condensation. Perhaps in the primæval nebula,\r\nfrom which the solar system originated, there were half-a-dozen or more\r\nof these centres that were of conspicuous importance, while a much\r\nlarger number of small points were also distinguished from the\r\nsurrounding nebula. (Figs. 40 and 41.) And still the contraction went\r\non. The heat, or rather the energy with which the nebula had been\r\noriginally charged, was still being dissipated by radiation. We give no\r\nestimate of the myriads of years that each stage of the mighty process\r\nmust have occupied. The tendency of the transformation was, however,\r\nalways in one direction. It did at last result in a great increase of\r\nthe density of the substance of the nebula, both in the central regions\r\nas well as in the subordinate parts. In due time this increase in\r\ndensity had reached such a point that the materials in the condensing\r\ncentres could be no longer described as retaining the gaseous form.\r\n\r\nBut though heat was incessantly being radiated from the great nebula, it\r\ndid not necessarily follow that the nebula was itself losing\r\ntemperature. This is a seeming paradox to which we have already had\r\noccasion to refer in Chapter VI. We need not now further refer to it\r\nthan to remember that, in speaking of the loss of heat from the nebula,\r\nit would sometimes not be correct to describe the operation as that of\r\ncooling. Up to a certain stage in the condensation, the loss of heat\r\nleads rather to an augmentation of temperature than to its decline.\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to see how the laws of heat, after being in action on\r\nthe primitive nebula for a period of illimitable ages, have at last\r\neffected a marvellous transformation. That nebula has condensed into a\r\nvast central mass with a number of associated subordinate portions. We\r\nmay suppose that the original nebula in the course of time does\r\npractically disappear. It is absorbed by the attraction of those\r\nponderous centres which have gradually developed throughout its extent.\r\n\r\nThe large central body, and perhaps some of the other bodies thus\r\nevolved, are at first of so high a temperature that a copious radiation\r\nof heat still goes forth from the system. As they discharge their stores\r\nof heat, the smaller bodies show the effects of loss of heat more\r\nrapidly than those which are larger. It is indeed obvious that a small\r\nbody must cool more rapidly than a big one. It is sufficient to note\r\nthat the cooling takes place from the surface, and that the bigger the\r\nbody the larger the quantity of material that it contains for each unit\r\nof superficial area. If the radius of a sphere be doubled, its volume is\r\nincreased eightfold, while its surface is only increased fourfold.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.—THE RING NEBULA IN LYRA (Lick Observatory).\r\n(_From the Royal Astronomical Society Series._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now concentrate our attention on two of the bodies which, after\r\nimmense ages, have been formed from the condensation of the primæval\r\nnebula. Let one of the two bodies be that central object, which\r\npreponderates so enormously that its mass is a thousandfold that of all\r\nthe others taken together. Let the other be one of the smaller bodies.\r\nAs it parts with its heat, the smaller body, which has originally\r\ncondensed from the nebula, will assume some of the features of a mass of\r\nmolten liquid. From the liquid condition, the body will pass with\r\ncomparative rapidity into a solid state, at least on its outer parts.\r\nThe exterior of this body will therefore become solid while the interior\r\nis still at an excessively high temperature. The outer material, which\r\nhas assumed the solid form, is constituted of the elements with which we\r\nare acquainted, and is in the form of what the geologist would class as\r\nthe igneous rocks, of which granite is the best known example. The shell\r\nof hard rocks outside encloses the material which is still heated and\r\nmolten inside. Such a crust would certainly be an extremely bad\r\nconductor of heat. The internal heat is therefore greatly obstructed in\r\nits passage outwards to the surface. The internal heat may consequently\r\nbe preserved in the interior of the body for an enormously protracted\r\nperiod, a period perhaps comparable with those immense ages which the\r\nevolution of the body from the primæval nebula has demanded. The smaller\r\nbody may have thus attained a condition in which the temperature\r\nreigning on its surface is regulated chiefly by the external conditions\r\nof the space around, while the internal parts are still highly charged\r\nwith the primitive heat from the original nebula.\r\n\r\nThe great central mass, which we may regard as thousands of times\r\ngreater than that of the subordinate body, cools much more slowly. The\r\ncooling of this great mass is so enormously protracted in comparison\r\nwith that of the smaller body that it is quite conceivable the central\r\nmass may continue to glow with intense fervour for immense ages after\r\nthe smaller body has become covered with hard rock.\r\n\r\nIt will, I hope, be clear that the two bodies to which I am here\r\nalluding are not merely imaginary objects. The small body, which has so\r\nfar cooled down that its surface has lost all indication of internal\r\nheat, is of course our earth. The great central mass which still glows\r\nwith intense fervour is the sun. Such is in outline the origin of the\r\nsun and the earth as suggested by the nebular theory.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said of the formation of the earth will equally apply to\r\nthe evolution of other detached portions of the primitive nebula. There\r\nmay be several of these, and they may vary greatly in size. The smaller\r\nthey are the more rapidly in general will the superabundant heat be\r\nradiated away, and the sooner will the surface of that planet acquire\r\nthe temperature which is determined by the surrounding conditions. There\r\nare, however, many modifying circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to notice that the primæval nebula must have had some\r\ninitial moment of momentum, unless we are to assume the occurrence of\r\nthat which is infinitely improbable. It would have been infinitely\r\nimprobable for the system not to have had some moment of momentum\r\noriginally. As the evolution proceeds, and as the energy is expended,\r\nwhile this original endowment of moment of momentum is preserved, we\r\nfind, as explained in the last chapter, the system gradually settling\r\ndown into proximity to a plane, and gradually acquiring a uniform\r\ndirection of revolution. Hence we see that each of the subordinate\r\nmasses which ultimately consolidate to form a planet have a motion of\r\nrevolution around the central body. In like manner the central body\r\nitself rotates, and all these motions are performed in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the revolutions of the planets around the sun, there are\r\nother motions which can be accounted for as consequences of the\r\ncontraction of the nebula. We now refer to that central portion which is\r\nto form the sun, and consider, in the first instance, only one of the\r\nsubordinate portions which is to form a planet. As these two bodies form\r\npart of the same nebulous mass they will to a certain extent rotate\r\ntogether as one piece. If any body is rotating as a whole, every part of\r\nthat body is also in actual rotation. We shall refer to this again later\r\non; but for the present it is sufficient to observe that as the planet\r\nwas originally continuous with the sun, it had a motion of rotation\r\nbesides its motion of revolution, and it revolved round its own axis in\r\na period equal to that of its revolution round the sun. In the beginning\r\nthe rotation of the planet was therefore an exceedingly slow movement.\r\nBut it became subsequently accelerated. For we have already explained\r\nthat each planet is by itself subjected to the law of the conservation\r\nof moment of momentum. As each planet assumes a separate existence, it\r\ndraws to itself its share of the moment of momentum, and that must be\r\nstrictly preserved. But the planet, or rather the materials which are to\r\nform the future planet, are all the time shrinking; they are drawing\r\nmore closely together. If, therefore, the area which each particle of\r\nthe planet describes when multiplied by the mass of that particle and\r\nadded to the similar products arising from all the other particles, is\r\nto remain constant, it becomes necessary that just as the orbits of\r\nthese particles diminish in size, so must the speed at which they\r\nrevolve increase. We thus find that there is a tendency in the planet to\r\naccelerate its rotation. And thus we see that a time will come when the\r\nplanet, having assumed an independent existence, will be found rotating\r\nround its axis with a velocity which must be considered high in\r\ncomparison with the angular velocity which the planet had while it still\r\nformed part of the original nebula.\r\n\r\nAs the planets have been evolved so as to describe their several orbits\r\naround the sun, so in like manner the smaller systems of satellites have\r\nbeen so evolved as to describe their orbits round the several planets\r\nthat are their respective primaries. When a planet, or rather the\r\nmaterials which were drawing together to form a planet, had acquired a\r\npredominant attraction for the parts of the primæval nebula in their\r\nlocality, a portion of the nebulous material became specially associated\r\nwith the planet. As the planet with this nebulous material became\r\nseparated from the central contracting sun, or became, as it were, left\r\nbehind while the sun was drawing into itself the material which\r\nsurrounded it the planet and its associated nebula underwent on a\r\nminiature scale an evolution similar to that which had already taken\r\nplace in the formation of the sun and the planets as a whole. In this\r\nmanner secondary systems seem sometimes to have had their origin.\r\n\r\nWe should, however, say that though what we have here indicated appears\r\nto explain fully the evolution of some of the systems, such, for\r\ninstance, as that of Jupiter and his four moons, or Saturn and his eight\r\nor nine, the circumstances with regard to the earth and the moon are\r\nsuch as to require a very different explanation of the origin of our\r\nsatellite. In the first place we may notice that the great mass of the\r\nmoon, in comparison with the earth, is a wholly exceptional feature in\r\nthe relations between the planets and their satellites in the other\r\nparts of the system. In no other instance does the mass of a satellite\r\nbear to the mass of the planet a ratio anything like so great as the\r\nratio of our moon to the earth. The moon has a mass which is about\r\none-eightieth of the mass of the earth, while even the largest of\r\nJupiter’s satellites has not one ten-thousandth part of the mass of the\r\nplanet itself. The evolution of the earth and moon system has been\r\nbrought about in a manner very different from that of the evolution of\r\nthe other systems of satellites. We do not here enter into any\r\ndiscussion of the matter. We merely remind the reader that it is now\r\nknown, mainly by the researches of Professor G. H. Darwin, that in all\r\nprobability the moon was originally part of the earth, and that a\r\npartition having occurred while the materials of the earth and moon were\r\nstill in a plastic state, a small portion broke away to form the moon,\r\nleaving behind the greater mass to form the earth. Then, under the\r\ninfluence of tides, which may agitate a mass of molten rock, as the moon\r\nwas once (Fig. 39), just as they may agitate an ocean, the moon was\r\nforced away, and was ultimately conducted to its present orbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.—LUNAR CRATERS: HYGINUS AND ALBATEGNIUS.\r\n(_Photographed by MM. Loewy and Puiseux._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at first tempting to imagine that a theory which accounted so\r\nsatisfactorily for the evolution of the moon from the earth might also\r\naccount in a similar manner for the evolution of the earth from the sun.\r\nHad this been the case, it is needless to say that the principles we now\r\naccept in the nebular theory would have needed large modification, if\r\nnot actual abandonment. A close examination into the actual statistics\r\nbrings forcibly before us the exceptional character of the earth-moon\r\nsystem. It can be demonstrated that the earth could not have been\r\nevolved from the sun in the same manner as there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the moon has been evolved from the earth. The evolution of\r\nthe satellites of Jupiter has proceeded along lines quite different from\r\nthose of the evolution of the moon from the earth, so that we may,\r\nperhaps, find in the evolution of the satellites of Jupiter an\r\nillustration in miniature of the way in which the planets themselves\r\nhave been evolved in relation to the sun.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that the only spiral nebulæ which lie within the\r\nreach of our powers of observation, whether telescopic or photographic,\r\nappear to be objects of enormously greater cosmical magnificence than\r\nwas that primæval nebula from which so insignificant an object as the\r\nsolar system has sprung. The great spirals, so far as we can tell at\r\npresent, appear to be thousands of times, or even millions of times,\r\ngreater in area than the solar system. At this point, however, we must\r\nspeak with special caution, having due regard to the paucity of our\r\nknowledge of a most important element. Astronomers must confess that no\r\nefforts which have yet been made to determine the dimensions of a nebula\r\nhave been crowned with success. We have not any precise idea as to what\r\nthe distance of the great spiral might be. We generally take for granted\r\nthat these nebulæ are at distances comparable with the distances of the\r\nstars. On this assumption we estimate that the spiral nebulæ must\r\ntranscend enormously the dimensions of the primæval nebula from which\r\nthe solar system has sprung. The spiral nebulæ that have so far come\r\nwithin our observation seem to be objects of an order of magnitude\r\naltogether higher than a solar system. They seem to be engaged on the\r\nmajestic function of evolving systems of stars like the Milky Way,\r\nrather than on the inconsiderable task of producing a system which\r\nconcerns only a single star and not a galaxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.—A REMARKABLE SPIRAL (n.g.c. 628; in Pisces).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spiral form of structure is one in which Nature seems to delight. We\r\nfind it in the organic world allied with objects of the greatest\r\ninterest and beauty. The ammonite, a magnificent spiral shell sometimes\r\nexceeding three feet in diameter, belongs to a type which dominated the\r\nwaters of the globe in secondary times, and which still survives in the\r\nnautilus. The same form is reproduced in minute creations totally\r\ndifferent from ammonites in their zoological relations. Among the\r\nexquisite foraminifera which the microscopist knows so well may be found\r\nmost delicate and beautiful spirals. Just as we see every range of\r\nspiral in the animal world, from an organism invisible to the naked eye,\r\nup to an ammonite a yard or more across, so it would seem that there are\r\nspiral nebulæ ranging from such vast objects as the great spiral in\r\nCanes Venatici down to such relatively minute spirals as those whose\r\nhumble function it is to develop a solar system. It is no more than a\r\nreasonable supposition that the great spirals in the heavens are\r\nprobably only the more majestic objects of an extremely numerous class.\r\nThe smaller objects of this type—among which we might expect to find\r\nnebulæ like, in size and importance, to the primæval nebula of our\r\nsystem—are so small that they have not yet been recognised.\r\n\r\nIt should at this stage be mentioned that several curious small\r\nplanetary nebulæ have in these modern days been discovered by their\r\npeculiar spectra. If the nebulous character of these most interesting\r\nobjects had not been accidentally disclosed by characteristic lines in\r\ntheir spectra, these undoubted nebulæ would each have been classified\r\nmerely as stars. This fact will lead us to the surmise that there must\r\nbe myriads of nebulæ in the heavens, too small to come within the range\r\nof our telescopes or of our most sensitive photographic plates. Suppose\r\nthat a facsimile of the primæval nebula of our system, precisely\r\ncorresponding with it in size and identical with it in every detail,\r\nwere at the present moment located in space, but at a distance from our\r\nstandpoint, as great as the distance of, let us say, the great spiral;\r\nit seems certain that this nebula, even though it contained the\r\nmaterials for a huge sun and a potential system of mighty planets, if\r\nnot actually invisible to us here, would in all probability demand the\r\nbest powers of our instruments to reveal it, and then it would be\r\nclassed not as a nebula at all but as a star of perhaps the 12th or\r\n15th, or even smaller magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.—A CLEARLY CUT SPIRAL (n.g.c. 4321; in Coma\r\nBerenices).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that the class of minute planetary nebulæ make\r\nthemselves known solely by the fact that they exhibit the bright line\r\nindicative of gaseous spectra. If these objects (though still nebulæ)\r\nhad not displayed gaseous spectra, it is certain they would have escaped\r\ndetection, at least by the process which has actually proved so\r\nsuccessful. The continuous band of light which they would then have\r\npresented could not be discriminated from the band of light from a star.\r\nIt is therefore not improbable that among the star-like bodies which\r\nhave been represented on our photographs, there may be some which are\r\nreally minute spiral nebulæ. In general a star is a minute point of\r\nlight which no augmentation of telescopic power and no magnification\r\nwill show otherwise than as a point, granted only good optical\r\nconditions and good opportunity so far as the atmosphere is concerned.\r\nIt has, however, been occasionally noted that certain so-called stars\r\nare not mere points of light; they do possess what is described as a\r\ndisc. It is not at all impossible that the objects so referred to are\r\nspiral nebulæ. We may describe them as formed on a small scale in\r\ncomparison with the great spiral or the nebula in Andromeda. But the\r\nsmallness here referred to is only relative. They are in all probability\r\nquite as vast as the primæval spiral nebula from which the solar system\r\nhas been evolved, though not so large as those curious ring-shaped\r\nnebulæ of which the most celebrated example lies in the constellation\r\nLyra (Fig. 38).\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of what we believe to have been the history of our\r\nsolar system. We have already given the evidence derived from the laws\r\nof heat. We have now to consider the evidence which has been derived\r\nfrom the constitution of the system itself. We shall see how strongly it\r\nsupports the belief that the origin of sun and planets has been such as\r\nthe nebular theory suggests.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n          THE UNITY OF MATERIAL IN THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nClouds—Fire-Mist—Vapour of Platinum—Components of Chalk—Constituents of\r\n    the Primæval Fire-Mist—Objections—Origin of the Mist—Remarkable\r\n    Discovery of the Century—Analysis of the Sun—Spectroscopic\r\n    Analysis—Simplicity of Solar Chemistry—Potassium—A Drop of Water—The\r\n    Solar Elements—Calcium—The Most Important Lines in the Solar\r\n    Spectrum—Photograph of the Sun—Carbon in the Solar Clouds—Function\r\n    of Carbon—Bunsen’s Burner Illustrates Carbon in the Sun—Carbon\r\n    Vapours in the Sun—The Supposed Limit to our Knowledge of the\r\n    Heavens—Characteristics of Spectroscopic Work—Bearing on the Nebular\r\n    Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN considering how the formation of our solar system was brought about,\r\nwe naturally first enquire as to the material of which this superb\r\nscheme is constructed. What were the materials already to hand from\r\nwhich, in pursuance of the laws of Nature, the solar system was evolved?\r\n\r\nSee the robust and solid nature of this earth of ours, and the robust\r\nand solid nature of the moon and the planets. It might at first sight be\r\nconcluded that the primitive materials of our earth had also been in the\r\nsolid state. But such is not the case. The primitive material of the\r\nsolar system was not solid, it was not even liquid. What we may describe\r\nas the mother-substance of the universe must have been of quite a\r\ndifferent nature; we can give an illustration of the physical character\r\nof that substance.\r\n\r\nThe lover of Nature delights to look at the mountains and the trees, the\r\nlakes and the rivers. But he will not confine his regard merely to the\r\nobjects on the earth’s surface. He, no less than the artist and the\r\npoet, delights to gaze at that enchanting scenery which, day by day, is\r\ndisplayed in infinite beauty overhead; that scenery which is not wholly\r\nwithheld even from observers whose lives may be passed amid the busy\r\nhaunts of men, that scenery which is so often displayed on fine days at\r\nall seasons. We are alluding to those clouds which add the charm of\r\ninfinite variety to the sky above us.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for us now to think of matter when it possesses neither\r\nthe density of a solid, nor the qualities of a liquid, but rather when\r\nit has that delicate texture which the clouds exhibit. The primæval\r\nmaterial from which the solar system has been evolved is of a texture\r\nsomewhat similar to that of the clouds. This primæval material is\r\nneither solid nor liquid; it is what we may describe as vapour.\r\n\r\nBut having pointed to the clouds in our own sky as illustrating, in a\r\nsense, the texture of this original mother-substance of the solar\r\nsystem, we can carry the analogy no further. Those dark and threatening\r\nmasses which forbode the thunderstorm, or those beautiful fleecy clouds\r\nwhich enhance the loveliness of a summer’s day, are, of course, merely\r\nthe vapours of water. But the vapours in the mother-substance from which\r\nsystems have been evolved were by no means the vapours of water. They\r\nwere vapours of a very different character—vapours that suggest the\r\nabodes of Pluto rather than the gentle rain that blesses the earth. In\r\nthe mother-substance of the solar system vapours of a great variety of\r\nsubstances were blended. For in the potent laboratory of Nature every\r\nsubstance, be it a metal or any other element, or any compound, no\r\nmatter how refractory, will, under suitable circumstances, be dissolved\r\ninto vapour.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, such a material as platinum. Could anything be less\r\nlike a vapour than this silvery metal? We know that platinum is the\r\ndensest of all the elements. We know that platinum, more effectually\r\nthan other metals, resists liquefaction from the application of heat. No\r\nordinary furnace can fuse platinum; yet in another way we can overcome\r\nthe resistance of this metal. The electric arc, when suitably managed,\r\nyields a temperature higher than that of any furnace. Let the electric\r\ncurrent spring from one pole of platinum to another, and a brilliant arc\r\nof light is produced by the glowing gas, which is characteristic of\r\nplatinum. The light dispensed from that arc is different from the light\r\nthat would be radiated if the poles were of any material other than\r\nplatinum. Some of the platinum has not alone been melted, it has\r\nactually been turned into vapour by the overpowering heat to which it\r\nhas been subjected. Thus the solidity of this substance, which resists\r\nso stubbornly the action of lower temperatures, can be overcome, and the\r\nvery densest of all metals is dissolved into wisps of vapour.\r\n\r\nWe choose the case of platinum as an illustration because it is a\r\nsubstance exceptionally dense and exceptionally refractory. If platinum\r\ncan be vaporised, there is not much difficulty in seeing that other\r\nelements must be capable of being vaporised also. In fact, given such\r\nheat as is found abundantly in natural sources, there is no known\r\nelement, or combination of elements, which will not assume the form of\r\ngas or vapour or cloud.\r\n\r\nAt the temperature of the sun a drop of water would be forthwith\r\nresolved into its component gases of oxygen and hydrogen. In like manner\r\na piece of chalk, if exposed to the sun, would be speedily transformed;\r\nit would first be heated red-hot and then white-hot; it is, indeed,\r\nwhite-hot chalk that gives us that limelight which we know so well. But\r\nthe heat of the sun is far greater than the temperature of the\r\nincandescent lime. The lime would not only be heated white-hot by\r\ncontact with solar heat, but still further stages would be reached. It\r\nwould suffer decomposition. It would break up into three different\r\nelements: there would be the metal which we call calcium, there would be\r\noxygen, and there would be carbon. Owing to the tremendous temperature\r\nof the sun the metal would not remain in the metallic form; it would not\r\nbe even in a liquid form; it would become a gas. The elements which\r\nunite to form this chalk would be not only decomposed, but they would be\r\nvaporised. What is thus stated about the drop of water and the chalk\r\nmay, so far as we know, be stated equally with regard to any other\r\ncompounds. It matters not how close may be the chemical association in\r\nwhich the elements are joined: no matter how successfully those\r\ncompounds may resist the decomposition under the conditions ordinarily\r\nprevailing on earth, they have to yield under the overwhelming trial to\r\nwhich the sun would subject them. Though there are many elements in the\r\nsolar chemistry, there are no compounds. At the exalted temperature to\r\nwhich they are exposed in the sun the elements are indisposed for union\r\nwith the other elements there met with, and which are at the same\r\ntemperature. In these circumstances, they successfully resist all\r\nalliances.\r\n\r\nUntil the last few years no elements were known in our terrestrial\r\nexperience which possessed at ordinary temperatures the same qualities\r\nof resolute isolation which all elements seem to display at extreme\r\ntemperatures. The famous discovery of argon, and of other strange gases\r\nassociated with argon in the atmosphere and elsewhere, has revealed, to\r\nthe astonishment of chemists and to the great extension of knowledge,\r\nthat we have with us here elements which resist all solicitations to\r\nenter into chemical union with other substances. It is doubtless in\r\nconsequence of this absolute refusal to unite that, in spite of their\r\nabundance and their wide distribution, these elements have eluded\r\ndetection for centuries. To the astronomer argon is both interesting and\r\ninstructive. It shows us an element which possesses, at the ordinary\r\ntemperatures of the surface of the earth, a property which is true of\r\nall elements when subjected to such temperatures as are found in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThink of the rocks which form the earth’s crust and of the minerals\r\nwhich lie far below. Think of the soil which lies on its surface, of the\r\nforests which that soil supports, and the crops which it brings forth.\r\nThink of the waters of the ocean, and the ice of the Poles. Think of the\r\nobjects of every kind on this globe. Think of the stone walls of a great\r\nbuilding, of the iron used to give it strength, of the slates which\r\ncover it, and of the timber which forms its floors; think of the\r\ninnumerable other materials which have gone towards its construction;\r\nthink even of the elementary substances which go to form the bodies of\r\nanimals, of the lime in their bones, and of the carbon which is so\r\nintimately associated with life itself. The nebular theory declares that\r\nthose materials have not always been in the condition in which we now\r\nsee them; that there was a time in which they were so hot that they were\r\nnot in the solid state; they were not even in the fluid state, but were\r\nall in rolling volumes of glowing vapour which formed the great primæval\r\nfire-cloud.\r\n\r\nWe must understand the composite nature of the primitive fire-mist from\r\nwhich our solar system originated. Let me illustrate the matter thus: We\r\nshall suppose that a heterogeneous collection of substances is brought\r\ntogether, the items of which may be somewhat as follows: let there be\r\nmany tons of iron and barrels of lime, some pieces of timber, and\r\ncargoes of flint; let there be lead and tin and zinc, and many other\r\nmetals, from which copper and silver and several of the rarest metals\r\nmust not be excluded; let there be innumerable loads of clay, which\r\nshall represent aluminium and silicon, and hogsheads of sea-water to\r\nsupply oxygen, hydrogen, and sodium. There should be also, I need hardly\r\nadd, many other elements; but there is no occasion to mention more;\r\nindeed, it would be impossible to give a list which would be complete.\r\n\r\nSuppose that this diverse material is submitted to a heat as intense as\r\nthe most perfect furnace can make it. Let the heat be indeed as great as\r\nthat which we can get from the electric arc, or even greater still. Let\r\nus suppose this heat to be raised to such a point that, not only have\r\nthe most refractory metals been transformed into vapour, but the\r\nelements which were closely in combination have also been rent asunder.\r\nThis we know will happen when compound substances are raised to a very\r\nhigh temperature. We shall suppose that the heat has been sufficient to\r\nseparate each particle of water into its constituent atoms of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen; we shall suppose that the heat has been sufficient to\r\ndecompose even lime itself into its constituent parts, and exhibit them\r\nin the form of vapour. The heat is to be so great that even carbon\r\nitself, the most refractory of substances, has had to yield, so that\r\nafter passing through a stage of dazzling incandescence it has melted\r\nand ultimately dissolved into vapour. Next let us suppose that these\r\nseveral vapours are blended, though we need not assume that the separate\r\nelements are diffused uniformly throughout all parts of the cloud. Let\r\nus suppose that these bodies, which contributed to form the nebula, have\r\nbeen employed in amounts, not to be measured in tons, or in hundreds of\r\ntons, but in a thousand millions of millions of millions of millions of\r\ntons. Let the mass of vapour thus arising be expanded freely through\r\nopen space. Let it extend over a region which is to measure hundreds of\r\nthousands of millions of miles in length and breadth and depth. Then the\r\ndoctrine of the earth’s beginning, which we are striving to unfold in\r\nthese lectures, declares that in a fire-mist such as is here outlined\r\nthe solar system had its origin.\r\n\r\nVarious objections may occur to the thoughtful reader when asked to\r\naccept such statements. We must do our best to meet these objections.\r\nThe evidence we submit must be of an indirect or circumstantial kind.\r\nDirect testimony on such a subject is from the nature of the case\r\nimpossible. The actual fire-mist in which our system had its origin is a\r\nmist no longer. The material that forms the solid earth beneath our feet\r\ndid once, we verily believe, float in the great primæval fire-mist. Of\r\ncourse we cannot show you that mist. Darwin could not show the original\r\nmonkeys from which it would seem the human race has descended; none the\r\nless do most of us believe that our descent has really taken the line\r\nthat Darwin’s theory indicates.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, as with most others, it is easy to ask\r\nquestions which, I think we may say, no one can answer with any\r\nconfidence. It may, for instance, be asked how this vast fire-mist came\r\ninto existence. If it arose from heat, how did that heat happen to be\r\npresent? Why was all the material in the state of vapour? What, in\r\nshort, was the origin of that great primæval nebula? Here we must admit\r\nthat we have proposed questions to which it is impossible for us to do\r\nmore than suggest answers. As to what brought the mist into existence,\r\nas to whence the materials came, and as to whence the energy was derived\r\nwhich has been gradually expended ever since, we do not know anything,\r\nand, so far as I can see, we have no means of knowing. Conjectures on\r\nthe subject are not wanting, of course, and in a later chapter we shall\r\ndiscuss what may be said on this matter.\r\n\r\nI have shown you to some extent our reasons for believing that our solar\r\nsystem did originate in a fire-mist And even if we are not able to\r\nexplain how the mist itself arose, yet we do not admit that our argument\r\nas to the origin of our system is thereby invalidated. That such a\r\nfire-mist as the solar system required did once exist, must surely be\r\nregarded as not at all improbable so long as we can point to the\r\nanalogous nebulæ or fire-mists which exist at the present moment, and\r\nwhich we see with our telescopes. Many of these are millions of times as\r\ngreat as the comparatively small fire-mist that would have evolved into\r\nour solar system.\r\n\r\nA question has sometimes been asked as to the most important discovery\r\nin astronomy which has been made in the century that has just closed.\r\nIf, by the most important discovery, we mean that which has most widely\r\nextended our knowledge of the Universe, I do not think there need be\r\nmuch hesitation in stating the answer. It seems to me beyond doubt that\r\nthe most astonishing discovery of the last century in regard to the\r\nheavenly bodies is that which has revealed the elementary substances of\r\nwhich the orbs of heaven are composed. This discovery is the more\r\ninteresting and instructive because it has taught us that the materials\r\nof the sun, of the stars, and of the nebulæ are essentially the elements\r\nof which our own earth is formed, and with which chemists had already\r\nbecome well acquainted.\r\n\r\nWe know, of course, that this earth, no matter how various may be the\r\nrocks and minerals which form its crust, and how infinite the variety of\r\nobjects, organic and inorganic, which diversify its surface, is really\r\nformed from different combinations of about eighty different elements.\r\nThere are gases like oxygen and hydrogen, there are other substances\r\nlike carbon and sulphur, and there are metals like iron and copper.\r\nThese elements are sometimes met with in their free or uncombined state,\r\nlike oxygen in the atmosphere, or like gold in Klondike. More frequently\r\nthey are found in combination, and in such combinations the characters\r\nof the constituent elements are sometimes completely transformed. A\r\ndeadly gas and a curious metal, which burns as it floats on water, most\r\ncertainly renounce their special characters when they unite to form the\r\nsalt on our breakfast-table. Who would have guessed, if the chemist had\r\nnot told him, that in every wheelbarrowful of ordinary earth there are\r\npounds of silvery aluminium, and that marble is largely composed of an\r\nextremely rare metal, which but few people have ever seen?\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the century just completed it seemed utterly\r\nimpossible to form any notion as to the substances actually present in\r\nthe sun. How could anyone possibly discern them by the resources of the\r\nolder chemists? It might well have been doubted whether the elements of\r\nwhich the sun was made were the elements of which our earth was formed,\r\nand with which ordinary chemistry had made us familiar. Just as the\r\nanimals and plants which met the gaze of the discoverers when they\r\nlanded in the New World were essentially different from those in the Old\r\nWorld, so it might have been supposed, with good share of reason, that\r\nthis great solar orb, ninety-three million miles distant, would be\r\ncomposed of elements totally different from those with which dwellers on\r\nthe earth had been permitted to become acquainted.\r\n\r\nThis great discovery of the last century revealed to us the character of\r\nthe elements which constitute the sun. It also added the astonishing\r\ninformation that they are essentially the same elements as those of\r\nwhich our earth itself and all which it contains are formed.\r\n\r\nIf any one had asked in the early years of the century what those\r\nelements were which entered into the composition of the sun, the\r\nquestion would have been deemed a silly one; it would have been regarded\r\nas hopelessly beyond the possibility of solution, and it would have been\r\nas little likely to receive an answer as the questions people sometimes\r\nask now as to the possible inhabitants on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut about the middle of the century a new era dawned; the wonderful\r\nmethod of spectroscopic analysis was discovered, and it became possible\r\nto examine the chemistry of the sun. The most important result was to\r\nshow that the elements which enter into the composition of the sun are\r\nthe same elements which enter into the composition of the earth. The\r\nstudent of the solar chemistry enjoys, however, one advantage over the\r\nterrestrial chemist, if it be an advantage to have his science\r\nsimplified to the utmost extent. Chemistry would, however, lose its\r\nchief interest if all the elements remained as obstinately neutral as\r\nargon, and disdained alliance with all other elements. It would seem\r\nthat those elements which most eagerly enter into combination here, and\r\nwhich resist with such vehemence our efforts to divorce them, must\r\nrenounce all chemical union when exposed to the tremendous temperature\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nThose elements which unite with the utmost eagerness at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, seem to become indifferent to each other when subjected to\r\nthe extremes of heat and cold. Potassium unites fiercely with oxygen in\r\nthe most familiar of all chemical experiments. Potassium is indeed a\r\nstrange metal, for it is of such small density that a piece cast on a\r\nbasin of water will float like a chip of wood. It has such avidity for\r\noxygen that it will decompose the water to wrench the molecules of\r\noxygen from those of hydrogen. The union of the metal with the gas\r\ngenerates such heat that the strange substance bursts into flame. This\r\nis what takes place at the ordinary temperatures in the well-known\r\nexperiment of the chemical lecture-table. But at extreme temperatures\r\nthe greed of potassium for oxygen abates, if it does not vanish\r\naltogether. In those excessively low temperatures at which Professor\r\nDewar experiments chemical affinities languish. He has reduced oxygen to\r\na liquid, and he tells us that “a berg of silvery potassium might float\r\nfor ever untarnished on an ocean of liquid oxygen.” At the excessively\r\nhigh temperature of the electric arc the oxygen and the potassium, whose\r\nunion has been accomplished with such vehemence, cease to possess\r\naffinity, and they separate again.\r\n\r\nThe solar chemistry seems to know no combination. If a drop of water\r\nwere transferred to the sun and subjected to the heat of the solar\r\nsurface, it must immediately undergo decomposition. That which was a\r\ndrop of water here would not remain a drop of water there; it would be\r\nat once resolved into its component elements of oxygen and hydrogen. The\r\nconsiderations just given greatly simplify the search for the particular\r\nbodies which are at present in the sun. We have only to test for the\r\npresence of each of eighty elements. We have not to take account of the\r\nthousands of chemical combinations of which these elements are\r\nsusceptible under terrestrial conditions.\r\n\r\nWe are specially indebted to the late Professor Henry Rowland, of\r\nBaltimore, for a profound study of the solar spectrum. In his great work\r\nhe enumerates thirty-six elements present in the sun, and the number may\r\nbe increased now by at least two. Eight elements he classes as doubtful,\r\nfifteen are set down as absent from the solar spectrum, and several had\r\nnot been tried. Iron stands foremost among all the solar elements, so\r\nfar as the number of its lines are concerned. No fewer than 2,000 lines\r\nin the spectrum of the sun are attributed to this element. At the other\r\nend of the list lead is found. There is only one line apparently due to\r\nthis metal. Carbon is represented by about 200 lines, and calcium by\r\nabout 75. If, however, we test the significance of lines not by their\r\nnumber, but by their intensity, then iron no longer heads the list, its\r\nplace being taken by calcium (Fig. 42). Among the elements which Rowland\r\nsets down as not contributing any recognisable lines to the solar\r\nspectrum we may mention arsenic and sulphur, phosphorus, mercury, and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nOf the more prominent solar elements there are two or three of such\r\nspecial importance that we pause to give them a little consideration.\r\nWho does not remember the delight of the first occasion in childhood\r\nwhen he was permitted to peep into a bird’s-nest and there see a group\r\nof eggs, often so exquisitely marked or so delicately tinted? How\r\nbeautiful they seemed as they lay in their cosy receptacle concealed\r\nwith so much cunning! Among other delightful recollections of early\r\nyouth many will recall a ramble by the sea-shore. We may suppose the\r\ntide had retreated, and with other objects left by the sea on the\r\ngleaming sand a little cowrie shell is found. How enchanted we were with\r\nour prize! How we looked at the curious marks on its lips, and the\r\ninimitable beauty of its tints!\r\n\r\nThe shell of the hedge-sparrow and the shell cast up by the sea have\r\nanother quality in common besides their beauty. They have both been\r\nfabricated from the same material. Lime is of course the substance from\r\nwhich the bird, by some subtle art of physiology, forms those exquisite\r\nwalls by which the vital part of the egg is protected. The soft organism\r\nthat once dwelt in the cowrie was endowed with some power by which it\r\nextracted from the waters of the ocean the lime with which it gradually\r\nbuilt an inimitable shell. Is it an exaggeration to say that this\r\nparticular element calcium, this element so excessively abundant and so\r\nrarely seen, seems to enjoy some peculiar distinction by association\r\nwith exquisite grace and beauty? The white marble wrought to an\r\nunparalleled loveliness by the genius of a Phidias or a Canova is but a\r\nform of lime. So is the ivory on which the Japanese artist works with\r\nsuch delicacy and refinement. Whether as coral in a Pacific island, as a\r\npearl in a necklace or as a stone in the Parthenon, lime seems often\r\nprivileged to form the material basis of beauty in nature and beauty in\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThough lime in its different forms, in the rocks of the earth or the\r\nwaters of the ocean, is one of the most ordinary substances met with on\r\nour globe, yet calcium, the essential element which goes to the\r\ncomposition of lime, is, as we have already said, not by any means a\r\nfamiliar body, and not many of us, I imagine, can ever have seen it.\r\nChemistry teaches that lime is the result of a union in definite\r\nproportions between oxygen gas and the very shy metal, calcium. This\r\nmetal is never found in nature unless in such intimate chemical union\r\nwith some other element like oxygen or chlorine, that its characteristic\r\nfeatures are altogether obscured, and would indeed never be suspected\r\nfrom the mere appearance of the results of the union. To see the metal\r\ncalcium you must visit a chemical laboratory where, by electrical\r\ndecomposition or other ingenious process, this elusive element can be\r\ninduced to part temporarily from its union with the oxygen or other body\r\nfor which it has so eager an affinity, and to which it returns with such\r\nalacrity. Though calcium is certainly a metal, it is very unlike the\r\nmore familiar metals such as gold or silver, copper or iron. A coin\r\nmight conceivably be formed out of calcium, but it would have no\r\nstability like the coins of the well-known metals. Calcium has such an\r\nunconquerable desire to unite with oxygen that the unstable metal will\r\nspeedily grasp from the surrounding air the vital element. Unless\r\nspecial precautions are taken to withhold from the calcium the air, or\r\nother source from whence it could obtain oxygen, the union will most\r\ncertainly take place, and the calcium will resume the stable form of\r\nlime. Thus it happens that though this earth contains incalculable\r\nbillions of tons of calcium in its various combinations, yet calcium\r\nitself is almost unknown except to the chemist.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that calcium plays a part of tremendous significance on this\r\nearth. I do not say that it is the most important of all the elements.\r\nIt would indeed seem impossible to assign that distinction to any\r\nparticular element. Many are, of course, of vital importance, though\r\nthere are, no doubt, certain of the rarer elements with which this earth\r\ncould perhaps dispense without being to any appreciable extent different\r\nfrom what it is at present. I do not know that we should be specially\r\ninconvenienced or feel any appreciable want unsatisfied, if, let us say,\r\nthe element lanthanum were to be struck out of existence; and there are\r\nperhaps certain other rare bodies among the known eighty elements, about\r\nwhich the same remark might be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.—THE H. AND K. LINES IN THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SOLAR\r\nSPECTRUM (Higgs).]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut without calcium there would neither be fertile soil for plants nor\r\nbones for animals, and consequently a world, inhabited in the same\r\nmanner as our present globe, would be clearly impossible. There may be\r\nlowly organisms on this earth to which calcium is of no appreciable\r\nconsequence, and it is of course conceivable that a world of living\r\ntypes could be constructed without the aid of that particular element\r\nwhich is to us so indispensable. But a world without calcium would be\r\nradically different from that world which we know, so that we are\r\ndisposed to feel special interest in the important modern discovery that\r\nthis same element, calcium, is abundantly distributed throughout the\r\nuniverse. The boldest and most striking features in the photograph of\r\nthe solar spectrum are those due to calcium (Figs. 42 and 44).\r\n\r\nIn the solar spectrum are two very broad, very dark, and very\r\nconspicuous lines, known as H and K. In every photograph of that portion\r\nof the solar spectrum which, lying beyond the extreme violet, is\r\ninvisible to our eyes, though intensely active on the photographic\r\nplate, these lines stand forth so boldly as to arrest the attention more\r\nthan any other features of the spectrum. It had been known that these\r\nlines were due to calcium, but there were certain difficulties connected\r\nwith their interpretation. Some recent beautiful researches by Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Huggins have cleared away all doubt. It is now certain\r\nthat the presence of these lines in the spectrum demonstrates that that\r\nremarkable element which is the essential feature of lime on this earth\r\nis also found in the sun. We have also to note that these same lines\r\nhave been detected in the photographic spectra of many other bodies in\r\nwidely different regions of space. Thus we establish the interesting\r\nresult that this particular element which plays a part so remarkable on\r\nour earth is not restricted to our globe, but is diffused far and wide\r\nthroughout the universe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most astonishing discovery made in modern times about the\r\nsun is connected with the wonderful element, helium. So long ago as 1868\r\nSir Norman Lockyer discovered, during an eclipse, that the light of the\r\nsun contained evidence of the presence in that orb of some element which\r\nwas then totally unknown to chemists. This new body was not unnaturally\r\nnamed the sun-element, or helium. But more than a quarter of a century\r\nhad to elapse before any chemist could enjoy the opportunity of\r\nexperimenting directly upon helium. No labour could prepare the smallest\r\nparticle of this substance, no money could purchase it, for at that time\r\nno specimen of the element was known to exist nearer than the sun,\r\nninety-three million miles distant. But in 1895 an astonishing discovery\r\nwas made by Professor Ramsay. He was examining a rare piece of mineral\r\nfrom Norway. From this mineral, clevite, the Professor extracted a\r\nlittle gas which was to him and to all other chemists quite unknown. But\r\non applying the spectroscope to examine the character of the light which\r\nthis gas emitted when submitted to the electric current, it yielded, to\r\ntheir amazement, the characteristic light of helium. Thus was the\r\nsun-element at last shown to be a terrestrial body, though no doubt a\r\nrare one. The circumstances that I have mentioned make helium for ever\r\nfamous among the constituents of the universe. It will never be\r\nforgotten that though from henceforth it may be regarded as a\r\nterrestrial body, yet it was first discovered, not in the earth beneath\r\nour feet, but in the far-distant sun.\r\n\r\nIn a previous picture (Fig. 14) we showed a photograph of a part of the\r\nsun’s surface; this striking view displays those glowing clouds from\r\nwhich the sun dispenses its light and heat. These clouds form a\r\ncomparatively thin stratum around the sun, the interior of which is very\r\nmuch darker. The layer of clouds is so thin that it may perhaps be\r\nlikened to the delicate skin of a peach in comparison with the luscious\r\ninterior. It is in these dazzling white clouds that we find the source\r\nof the sun’s brightness. Were those clouds removed, though the sun’s\r\ndiameter would not be appreciably reduced, yet its unparalleled lustre\r\nwould be at once lessened. We use the expression “clouds” in speaking of\r\nthese objects, for clouds they certainly are, in the sense of being\r\naggregates of innumerable myriads of minute beads of some substance; but\r\nthose solar clouds are very unlike the clouds of our own sky, in so far\r\nas the material of which they are made is concerned. The solar clouds\r\nare not little beads of water; they are little beads of white-hot\r\nmaterial so dazzlingly bright as to radiate forth the characteristic\r\nbrilliance and splendour of the sun. The solar clouds drift to and fro;\r\nthey are occasionally the sport of terrific hurricanes; they are\r\nsometimes driven away from limited areas, and in their absence we see\r\nmerely the black interior of the solar globe, which we call a sun-spot.\r\nNow comes the important question as to the material present in these\r\nclouds which confers on the sun its ability to radiate forth such\r\nabundant light and heat.\r\n\r\nThe profound truth already stated, that the solar elements are the same\r\nas the terrestrial elements, greatly simplifies the search for that\r\nparticular element which forms those solar clouds. As the sun is made of\r\nsubstances already known to us by terrestrial chemistry, and as there\r\nare no chemical compounds to embarrass us, the choice of the possible\r\nconstituents of those solar clouds becomes narrowed to the list of\r\nelements experimented on in our laboratories.\r\n\r\nWe owe to Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney, F.R.S., the discovery of the\r\nparticular element which forms those fire-clouds in the sun, and confers\r\non the presiding body of the solar system the power of being so useful\r\nto the planets which owe it allegiance. Carbon is the element in\r\nquestion. I need hardly add that carbon is well known as one of the most\r\ncommonplace and one of the most remarkable substances in Nature. A piece\r\nof coke differs from a piece of pure carbon only by the ash which the\r\ncoke leaves behind when burned. Timber is principally composed of this\r\nsame element, and when the timber is transformed into charcoal but\r\nlittle more than the carbon remains. Carbon is indeed everywhere\r\npresent. It is, as we have mentioned, one of the elements which enter\r\ninto the composition of a piece of chalk. Carbon is in the earth beneath\r\nour feet; it is in the air above us. Carbon is one of the chief\r\ningredients in our food, and it is by carbon that the heat of the body\r\nis sustained. Indeed, this remarkable element is intimately connected\r\nwith life in every phase. Every organic substance contains carbon, and\r\nit courses with the blood in our veins. It assumes the widest variety of\r\nforms, renders the greatest diversity of services, and appears in the\r\nmost widely different places. Carbon is indeed of a protean character,\r\nand there is a beautiful symbol of the unique position which it occupies\r\nin the scheme of Nature (Fig. 43). Carbon is associated not alone with\r\narticles of daily utility and of plenteous abundance, but it is carbon\r\nwhich forms the most exquisite gems “of purest ray serene.” The diamond\r\nis, of course, merely a specimen of carbon of absolute purity and in\r\ncrystalline form. Great as is the importance of carbon on this earth, it\r\nis spread far more widely; it is not confined merely to the earth, for\r\ncarbon abounds on other bodies in space. The most important functions of\r\ncarbon in the universe are not those it renders on this earth. It was\r\nshown by Dr. Stoney that this same wonderful substance is indeed a solar\r\nelement of vast utility. It is carbon which forms the glowing solar\r\nclouds to which our very life owes its origin.\r\n\r\nIn the incandescent lamp the brilliant light is produced by a glowing\r\nfilament of carbon, and one reason why we employ this element in the\r\nelectric lamp, instead of any other, may be easily stated. If we tried\r\nto make one of these lamps with an iron wire, we should find that when\r\nthe electric current is turned on and begins to flow through the wire,\r\nthe wire will, in accordance with a well-known law, become warm, then\r\nhot, red-hot, and white-hot; but even when white-hot the wire will not\r\nglow with the brightness that we expect from one of these lamps. Ere a\r\nsufficient temperature can be reached the iron will have yielded, it\r\nwill have melted into drops of liquid, continuity will be broken, the\r\ncircuit will be interrupted, and the lamp destroyed. We should not have\r\nbeen much more successful if instead of iron we had tried any other\r\nmetal. Even a platinum wire, though it will admit of being raised to a\r\nmuch higher temperature than a wire of iron or a wire of steel, cannot\r\nremain in the solid condition at the temperature which would be\r\nnecessary if the requisite incandescence is to be produced.\r\n\r\nThere is no known metal, and perhaps no substance whatever, which has so\r\nhigh a temperature of fusion as carbon. A filament of carbon, alone\r\namong the available elements, will remain continuous and unfused while\r\ntransmitting a current intense enough to produce that dazzling\r\nbrilliance which is expected from the incandescent lamp. This is the\r\nreason why this particular element carbon is an indispensable material\r\nfor the electrician.\r\n\r\nModern research has now demonstrated that just as we employ carbon as\r\nthe immediate agent for producing our beautiful artificial light, so the\r\nsun uses precisely the same element as the agent of its light and\r\nheat-giving power. In the extraordinary fervour which prevails in the\r\ninterior of the sun all substances of every description must submit to\r\nbe melted, nay, even to be driven into vapour. An iron poker, for\r\ninstance, would vanish into iron vapour if submitted to this appalling\r\nsolar furnace. Even carbon itself is unable to remain solid when\r\nsubjected to the intense heat prevailing in the inner parts of the sun.\r\nAt that heat carbon must assume the form of gas or vapour, just as iron\r\nor the other substances which yield more readily to the application of\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nBy the help of a simple experiment we may illustrate the significance of\r\nthe carbon vapours in the solar economy. Let us take a Bunsen burner, in\r\nwhich the air and gas are freely mingled before they enter into\r\ncombustion. If the air and the gas be properly proportioned, the\r\ncombustion is so perfect that though a great deal of heat is produced\r\nthere is but little light. The gas burned in this experiment ought to be\r\nthe ordinary gas of our mains, which depends for its illuminating power\r\non the circumstance that the hydrogen, of which the gas is chiefly\r\ncomposed, is largely charged with carbon. The illuminating power of the\r\ngas may indeed be measured by its available richness in carbon. As it\r\nenters the burner the carbon is itself in a gaseous form. This is not,\r\nof course, on account of a high temperature. The carbon of the coal-gas\r\nis in chemical union with hydrogen, and the result is in the form of\r\ninvisible gases. It is these composite gases, blended with large volumes\r\nof ordinary hydrogen, which form the illuminating gas of our mains.\r\n\r\nIn the Bunsen burner the admission of a proper proportion of air, which\r\nbecomes thoroughly mixed with the coal gas, produces perfect combustion.\r\nIn the act of burning, the oxygen of the air unites immediately with the\r\ngas; it combines with the hydrogen to form watery vapour, and it\r\ncombines with the carbon to form gases which are the well-understood\r\nproducts of combustion.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, we cut off the supply of air from the Bunsen burner, which\r\ncan be done in a moment by placing the hand over the ring of holes at\r\nthe bottom at which the air is admitted. Immediately a change takes\r\nplace in the combustion. In place of the steady, hardly visible, but\r\nintensely hot flame which we had before, we have now a very much larger\r\nflame which makes a bright and flickering flare that lights up the room.\r\nIf we re-admit the air at the bottom of the burner the light goes down\r\ninstantly; the small, pale flame replaces it, and again the perfect\r\ncombustion gives out intense heat at the expense of the light.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable change in the character of a gas-flame produced by\r\nadmitting air to mix with the gas before combustion is, of course,\r\neasily explained. The chemical action takes place with much greater\r\nfacility under these circumstances. The union of the carbon in the coal\r\ngas with the oxygen then takes place so thoroughly and instantaneously\r\nthat the carbon never seems to have abandoned the gaseous form even for\r\na moment in the course of the transformation. But in the case where air\r\nis not permitted to mingle with the gas, the supply of oxygen to unite\r\nwith the incandescent gases can only be obtained from the exterior of\r\nthe flame. The consequence is that the glowing gas charged with carbon\r\nvapour is chilled to some extent by contact with the cold air. It\r\ntherefore seems as if the union of the hydrogen with the oxygen\r\npermitted the particles of carbon in the flame to resume their solid\r\nform for a moment. But in that solid form these particles, being at a\r\nhigh temperature, have a wonderful efficiency for radiation, and\r\nconsequently brilliance is conferred upon the light. Most of the\r\nparticles of carbon speedily unite with the surrounding oxygen, and\r\nre-enter the gaseous state in a different combination. Some of them,\r\nhowever, may escape this fate, in which case they assume the undesirable\r\nform of smoke. The Bunsen lamp can thus be made to give an illustration\r\nof the fact that when carbon vapours receive a chill, the immediate\r\neffect of the chill is to transform the carbon from the gaseous form to\r\nmyriads of particles in the liquid, or more probably in the solid form.\r\nIn the latter state the carbon possesses a power of radiation greatly in\r\nexcess of that which it possessed in the gaseous state, even though the\r\ngas may have been at a much higher temperature than the white-hot solid\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nWe can now apply these principles to the explanation of the marvellous\r\nradiation of light and heat from the great orb of day. The buoyancy of\r\nthe carbon vapours is one of their most remarkable characteristics; they\r\ntend to soar upwards through the solar atmosphere until they attain an\r\nelevation considerably over that of many of the other materials in the\r\nheated vapours surrounding the great luminary. We may illustrate what\r\nhappens to these carbon vapours by considering the analogous case\r\npresented in the formation of ordinary clouds in our own skins. It is\r\ntrue, no doubt, that terrestrial clouds are composed of material very\r\ndifferent from that which enters into the solar clouds. Terrestrial\r\nclouds of course arise in this way; the generous warmth of the sun\r\nevaporates water from the great oceans, and transforms it into vapour.\r\nThis vapour ascends through our atmosphere, not at first as a visible\r\ncloud, but in the form of an invisible vapour. It is gradually diffused\r\nthroughout the upper air, until at last particles of water, but recently\r\nwithdrawn from the oceans, attain an altitude of a mile or more above\r\nthe surface of the earth. A transformation then awaits this aqueous\r\nvapour. In the coldness of those elevated regions the water can no\r\nlonger remain in the form of vapour. The laws of heat require that it\r\nshall revert to the liquid state. In obedience to this law the vapour\r\ncollects into liquid beads, and it is these liquid beads, associated in\r\ncountless myriads, which form the clouds we know so well. The same\r\nphenomenon of cloud-production is witnessed on a smaller scale in the\r\nformation of the visible puffs which issue from the funnel of a\r\nlocomotive. We generally describe these rolling white volumes as steam;\r\nbut this language is hardly correct. Steam, properly so called, is truly\r\nas invisible as the air itself; it is only after the steam has done its\r\nwork and is discharged into the atmosphere, and there receives a chill,\r\nthat it becomes suddenly transformed from the purely gaseous state into\r\nclustering masses of microscopic spheres of water, and thus becomes\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand the transformation of these buoyant carbon vapours\r\nwhich soar upwards in the sun. They attain an elevation at which the\r\nfearful intensity of the solar heat has been so far abated by the cold\r\nof outer space that the carbon gas is not permitted to remain any longer\r\nin the form of gas; it must return to the liquid or to the solid state.\r\nIn the first stage on this return the carbon gas becomes transformed,\r\njust in the same way as watery vapour ascending from the earth becomes\r\ntransformed into the fleecy cloud. Under the influence of its fall in\r\ntemperature the carbon vapour collects into a clustering host of little\r\nbeads of carbon. This is the origin of the glorious solar clouds. Each\r\nparticle of carbon in that magnificent radiant surface has a\r\ntemperature, and consequently a power of radiation, probably exceeding\r\nthat with which the filament of carbon glows in the incandescent\r\nelectric arc. When we consider that millions of millions of square miles\r\non our luminary are covered with clouds, of which every particle is so\r\nintensely bright, we shall perhaps be able to form some idea of that\r\ninimitable splendour which even across the awful gulf of ninety-three\r\nmillion miles transmits the indescribable glory of daylight.\r\n\r\nWe are perhaps at present living rather too close to the period itself\r\nto be able to appreciate to its full extent the greatness of that\r\ncharacteristic discovery made in astronomy during the century just\r\nclosed, to which the present chapter relates. In the early part of the\r\nlast century it might have been said—indeed, by a certain very\r\ndistinguished philosopher it actually was said—that a limit could be\r\nlaid down bounding the possibilities of our knowledge of the heavenly\r\nbodies. It was admitted that we might study the movements of the\r\ndifferent orbs in vastly greater detail than had been hitherto\r\nattempted, and that we might calculate the forces to which those orbs\r\nwere submitted. With the help of mathematical analysis we might pursue\r\nthe consequences of these forces to their remote ramifications; we might\r\ndetermine where the various orbs were situated at inimitably remote\r\nperiods in the past. We might calculate the positions which they shall\r\nattain at epochs to be reached in the illimitably remote future; we\r\nmight discover innumerable new stars and worlds; and we might map down\r\nand survey the distant parts of the universe. We might even sound the\r\ndepths of space and determine the distances of the more remote celestial\r\nbodies, much more distant than any of those which have already yielded\r\ntheir secrets; we might measure the dimensions of those bodies and\r\ndetermine their weights; we might add scores or hundreds to the list of\r\nthe known planets; we might multiply many times the number of known\r\nnebulæ and star-clusters; we might make measurements of many thousands\r\nof double stars; we might essay the sublime task of forming an inventory\r\nof the stars of the universe and compiling a catalogue in which the\r\nstars and their positions would be recorded in their millions; but, said\r\nthe philosopher to whom I have referred, though you might accomplish all\r\nthis, and much more in the same direction, yet there is a well-marked\r\nlimit to your possible achievements; you can, he said, never expect to\r\ndiscover the actual chemical elements of which the heavenly bodies are\r\ncomposed. Nobody could dispute the reasonableness of this statement at\r\nthe time he made it; indeed, it seemed to be a necessary deduction from\r\nour knowledge of the arts of chemistry, as those arts were understood\r\nbefore the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of his researches by the older method, the chemist\r\ncould no doubt discover the different elements of which the body was\r\nformed. That is to say, his art enabled him to accomplish this task,\r\nprovided one very essential and fundamental condition could be complied\r\nwith. However accomplished the chemist of fifty years ago might have\r\nbeen, he would assuredly have thought that he was being mocked if asked\r\nto determine the composition of a body which was 93,000,000 miles away\r\nfrom him. The very idea of forming an analysis under such conditions\r\nwould have been scouted as preposterous. He would naturally ask that a\r\nspecimen of the body should be delivered into his hands, a specimen\r\nwhich he could take into his laboratory, pulverise in his mortars, place\r\nin his test-tubes, treat with his re-agents, or examine with his\r\nblowpipe. Only by such methods was it then thought possible to obtain an\r\nanalysis and discover the elements from which any given substance was\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nFor in the early part of this century the splendid method of spectrum\r\nanalysis, that method which has revealed to us so many of the secrets of\r\nNature, had not yet come into being. When that memorable event took\r\nplace it was at once perceived that the spectroscope required no actual\r\ncontact with the object to be tested, but only asked to receive some of\r\nthe rays of light which that object dispersed when sufficiently heated.\r\nIt was obvious that this new method must be capable of an enormously\r\nenlarged application. The flame producing the vapour might be at one end\r\nof the room, while the spectroscope testing the elements in that vapour\r\nmight be at the other end. This new and beautiful optical instrument\r\ncould analyse an object at a distance of a hundred feet. But if\r\napplicable at a distance of a hundred feet, why not at a hundred yards,\r\nor a hundred miles, or a hundred million miles? Why might the method not\r\nbe used if the source of light were as far as the sun, or as far as a\r\nstar, or even as far as the remotest nebula, whose faint gleam on the\r\nsky is all that the mightiest telescope can show.\r\n\r\nPresently another great advance was recorded. As the study of this\r\nsubject progressed, it was soon found that a spectrum visible to the\r\nhuman eye was not always indispensable for the success of the analysis.\r\nThe photographic plate, which so frequently replaces the eye in other\r\nclasses of observation, has also been used to replace the eye in the use\r\nof the spectroscope. A picture has thus been obtained showing the\r\ncharacteristic lines in the spectrum of a celestial object. That object\r\nmay have been sunk in space to a distance so tremendous that even though\r\nthe light travelled at a pace sufficient to complete seven circuits of\r\nour earth in each second of time, yet the rays from the object in\r\nquestion may have been travelling for centuries before they reached our\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nHowever the rays of light may have become weakened in the course of that\r\njourney, they still faithfully preserve the credentials of their origin.\r\nAt last the light is decomposed in the spectroscope, and the several\r\nrays, which have been so closely commingled in their long voyage of\r\nmyriads of miles, are now for the first time forced to pursue different\r\ntracks; they thus reach their different destinations on the photographic\r\nplate, and they there engrave their characteristic inscriptions. Nature\r\nin this operation imparts for our instruction a message which it is our\r\nbusiness to interpret. It is true that these inscriptions are not always\r\neasily deciphered; many of them have not yet been understood. A portion\r\nof the solar spectrum showing many of the lines in the visible region is\r\nrepresented in the accompanying plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.—SPECTRUM OF COMET SHOWING CARBON LINES.\r\n(_Sir W. Huggins, K.C.B._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the insignificance of our earth when viewed in comparison\r\nwith the millions of other orbs in the universe, considering also the\r\nstupendous distances by which the earth is separated from innumerable\r\nglobes which are very much greater, it is certainly not a little\r\nastonishing to learn that the elements from which the various bodies in\r\nthe universe have been composed are practically the same elements as\r\nthose of which our earth is built. Is not this a weighty piece of\r\nevidence in favour of the theory that earth, sun, and planets are all\r\nportions of the same primæval nebula in which these elements were\r\nblended?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOLAR SPECTRUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not, of course, mean to affirm that the great primæval nebula was\r\nhomogeneous throughout its vast extent. The waters of ocean are not\r\nstrictly the same in all places; even the atmosphere is not absolutely\r\nuniform. Nature does not like homogeneity. The original nebula, we may\r\nwell believe, was irregular in form, and denser in some places than in\r\nothers. We do not suppose that if we could procure a sample of nebula in\r\none place and another sample from the same nebula, but in a different\r\nplace, say a hundred million miles distant, the two would show an\r\nidentity of chemical composition; two samples of rock from different\r\nparts of the same quarry will not always be identical. But we may be\r\nassured that, in general, whatever elements are present in the nebula\r\nwill be widely dispersed through its extent. If from different parts of\r\nthe nebula two globes are formed by condensation, though we should not\r\naffirm, and though in fact we could not believe, that those globes would\r\nbe of identical composition, yet we should reasonably expect that the\r\nelementary bodies which entered into their composition would be in\r\nsubstantial agreement. If one element, say iron, was abundant in one\r\nglobe, we should expect that iron would not be absent from the other.\r\nThus the elements represented in one body should be essentially those\r\nwhich were represented in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.—SPECTRUM OF SUN DURING ECLIPSE.\r\nTHE TWO CHIEF LINES ARE DUE TO CALCIUM.\r\n(_Evershed._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if the sun and the earth—to confine our attention\r\nsolely to those two bodies—had originated from the primæval nebula, they\r\nwould bear with them, as a mark of their common origin, a resemblance in\r\nthe elementary bodies of which they were composed. When Laplace framed\r\nhis theory, he had not, he could not have had, the slightest notion as\r\nto the particular elements in the sun. For anything he could tell, those\r\nelements might be absolutely different from the elements in the earth.\r\nYet, even without information on this critical point, the evidence for\r\nthe nebular theory appeared to him so cogent that he gave it the\r\nsanction of his name.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that if spectroscopic analysis had demonstrated that\r\nthe elements in the sun were totally different from the elements in the\r\nearth a serious blow would have been dealt to the nebular theory. The\r\ncollateral evidence, strong as it undoubtedly is, might hardly have\r\nwithstood so damaging an admission. If, on the other hand, we find, as\r\nwe actually have found, that the elements in the sun and the elements in\r\nthe earth are practically identical, we obtain the most striking\r\ncorroboration of the truth of the nebular theory. Had Kant and Laplace\r\nbeen aware of this most significant fact, they would probably have cited\r\nit as most important testimony. They would have pointed out that the\r\niron so abundant in the earth beneath our feet is also abundant in the\r\nsun overhead. They would, I doubt not, if they had known it, have dwelt\r\nupon the circumstance that with that element, carbon, which enters into\r\nevery organic body on this earth, our sun is also richly supplied, and\r\nthey would have hardly failed to allude to the wide distribution in\r\nspace of calcium, hydrogen, and many other well-known elements.\r\n\r\nLaplace mainly based his belief in the nebular theory on some remarkable\r\ndeductions from the theory of probabilities. To the consideration of\r\nthese we proceed in the next three chapters. We may, however, remark at\r\nthe outset that if the evidence derived from probabilities seemed\r\nsatisfactory to Laplace one hundred years ago, this same line of\r\nevidence, strengthened as it has been by recent discoveries, is\r\nenormously more weighty, at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                           THE FIRST CONCORD.\r\n\r\nCertain Remarkable Coincidences—The Plane of Movement of a\r\n    Planet—Consideration of Planes of Several Planetary Orbits—A\r\n    Characteristic of the Actual Planetary Motions not to be Explained\r\n    by Chance—The First Concord—The Planes not at Random—A Division of\r\n    the Right Angle—Statement of the Coincidences—An Illustration by\r\n    Parable—The Cause of the Coincidences—The Argument Strengthened by\r\n    the Asteroids—An Explanation by the Nebular Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the present chapter, and in the two chapters which are to follow, I\r\npropose to give an outline of those arguments in favour of the nebular\r\ntheory which are presented by certain remarkable coincidences observed\r\nin the movements of the bodies of our solar system. There are, indeed,\r\ncertain features in the movements of the planets which would seem so\r\ninexplicable if the arrangement of the system had taken place by chance,\r\nthat it is impossible not to seek for some physical explanation. We have\r\nalready had occasion to refer in previous chapters to the movements of\r\nthe bodies of our system. It will be our object at present to show that\r\nit is hardly conceivable that the movements could have acquired the\r\npeculiar characteristics they possess unless the solar system has itself\r\nhad an origin such as that which the nebular theory assigns.\r\n\r\nThe argument on which we are to enter is, it must be confessed, somewhat\r\nsubtle, but its cogency is irresistible. For this argument we are\r\nindebted to one of the great founders of the nebular theory. It was\r\ngiven by Kant himself in his famous essay.\r\n\r\nWe will commence with a preliminary point which relates to elementary\r\nmechanics. It may, however, help to clear up a difficult point in our\r\nargument if I now state some well-known principles in a manner specially\r\nadapted for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nLet us think of two bodies, A and S, and, for the sake of clearness, we\r\nmay suppose that each of these bodies is a perfect sphere. We might\r\nthink of them as billiard balls, or balls of stone, or balls of iron. We\r\nshall, however, suppose them to be formed of material which is perfectly\r\nrigid. They may be of any size whatever, large or small, equal or\r\nunequal. One of them may be no greater than a grain of mustard-seed, and\r\nthe other may be as large as the moon or the earth or the sun. Let us\r\nfurther suppose that there is no other body in the universe by which the\r\nmutual attraction of the two bodies we are considering can be interfered\r\nwith. If these two bodies are abandoned to their mutual attraction, let\r\nus now see what the laws of mechanics assure us must necessarily happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.—A SPIRAL PRESENTED EDGEWISE (n.g.c. 4631; in\r\nComa Berenices).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet A and S be simply released from initial positions of absolute rest.\r\nIn these circumstances, the two points will start off towards each\r\nother. The time that must elapse before the two bodies collide will\r\ndepend upon circumstances. The greater the initial distance between the\r\ntwo balls, their sizes being the same, the longer must be the interval\r\nbefore they come together. The relation between the distance separating\r\nthe bodies and the time that must elapse before they meet may be\r\nillustrated in this way. Suppose that two balls, both starting from rest\r\nat a certain distance, should take a year to come together by their\r\nmutual attraction, then we know that if the distance of the two balls\r\nhad been four times as great eight years would have to elapse before the\r\ntwo balls collided. If the distances were nine times as great then\r\ntwenty-seven years would elapse before the balls collided, and generally\r\nthe squares of the times would increase as the cubes of the distances.\r\nIn such statements we are supposing that the radii of the balls are\r\ninconsiderable in comparison with the distances apart from which they\r\nare started. The time occupied in the journey must also generally depend\r\non the masses of the two bodies, or, to speak more precisely, on the sum\r\nof the masses of the two bodies. If the two balls each weighed five\r\nhundred tons, then they would take precisely the same time to rush\r\ntogether as would two balls of one ton and nine hundred and ninety-nine\r\ntons respectively, provided the distances between the centres of the two\r\nballs had been the same in each case. If the united masses of the two\r\nbodies amounted to four thousand tons, then they would meet in half the\r\ntime that would have been required if their united masses were one\r\nthousand tons, it being understood that in each case they started with\r\nthe same initial distance between the centres.\r\n\r\nInstead of simply releasing the two bodies A and S so that neither of\r\nthem shall have any impulse tending to make it swerve from the line\r\ndirectly joining them, let us now suppose that we give one of the\r\nbodies. A, a slight push sideways. The question will be somewhat simpler\r\nif we think of S as very massive, while A is relatively small. If, for\r\ninstance, S be as heavy as a cannon-ball, while A is no heavier than a\r\ngrain of shot, then we may consider that S remains practically at rest\r\nduring the movement. The small pull which A is able to give will produce\r\nno more than an inappreciable effect on S. If the two bodies come\r\ntogether, A will practically do all the moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.—THE PLANE OF A PLANET’S ORBIT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe represent the movement in the adjoining figure. If A is started off\r\nwith an initial velocity in the direction A T, the attraction of S will,\r\nhowever, make itself felt, even though A cannot move directly towards S.\r\nThe body will not be allowed to travel along A T; it will be forced to\r\nswerve by the attraction of S; it will move from P to Q, gradually\r\ngetting nearer to S. To enter into the details of the movement would\r\nrequire rather more calculation than it would be convenient to give\r\nhere. Even though S is much more massive than A, we may suppose that the\r\npath which A follows is so great that the diameter of the globe S is\r\nquite insignificant in comparison with the diameter of the orbit which\r\nthe smaller body describes. We shall thus regard both A and S as\r\nparticles, and Kepler’s well-known law, to which we so often refer,\r\ntells us that A will revolve around S in that beautiful figure which the\r\nmathematician calls an ellipse. For our present purpose we are\r\nparticularly to observe that the movement is restricted to a plane. The\r\nplane in which A moves depends entirely on the direction in which it was\r\nfirst started. The body will always continue to move in the same plane\r\nas that in which its motion originally commenced. This plane is\r\ndetermined by the point S and the straight line in which A was\r\noriginally projected. It is essential for our argument to note that A\r\nwill never swerve from its plane so long as there are not other forces\r\nin action beside those arising from the mutual attractions of A and S.\r\nThe ordinary perturbations of one body by the action of others need not\r\nhere concern us.\r\n\r\nThe case we have supposed will, of course, include that of the movement\r\nof a planet round the sun. The planet is small and represented by the\r\nbody A, which revolves round the great body S, which stands for the sun.\r\nHowever the motion of the planet may actually have originated, it moves\r\njust as if it had received a certain initial impulse, in consequence of\r\nwhich it started into motion, and thus defined a certain plane, to which\r\nfor all time its motion would be restricted.\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken of only a single planet; let us now suppose that a\r\nsecond planet, B, is also to move in revolution about the same sun. This\r\nplanet may be as great as A, or bigger, or smaller, but we shall still\r\nassume that both planets are inconsiderable in comparison with S. We may\r\nassume that B revolves at the same distance as A, or it may be nearer,\r\nor further. The orbit of B might also have been in the same plane as A,\r\nor—and here is the important point—it might have been in a plane\r\ninclined at any angle whatever to the orbit of A. The two planes might,\r\nindeed, have been perpendicular. No matter how varied may be the\r\ncircumstances of the two planets, the sun would accept the control of\r\neach of them; each would be guided in its own orbit, whether that orbit\r\nbe a circle, or whether it be an ellipse of any eccentricity whatever.\r\nSo far as the attraction of the sun is concerned, each of these planets\r\nwould remain for ever in the same plane as that in which it originally\r\nstarted. Let us now suppose a third planet to be added. Here again we\r\nmay assume every variety in the conditions of mass and distance. We may\r\nalso assume that the plane which contains the orbit of this third planet\r\nis inclined at any angle whatever to the planes of the preceding\r\nplanets. In the same way we may add a fourth planet, and a fifth; and in\r\norder to parallel the actual circumstance of our solar system, so far as\r\nits more important members are concerned, we may add a sixth, and a\r\nseventh, and an eighth. The planes of these orbits are subjected to a\r\nsingle condition only. Each one of them passes through the centre of the\r\nsun. If this requirement is fulfilled, the planes may be in other\r\nrespects as different as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the actual solar system the circumstances are, however, very\r\ndifferent from what we have represented in this imaginary solar system.\r\nIt is the most obvious characteristic of the tracks of Jupiter and\r\nVenus, and the other planets belonging to the sun, that the planes in\r\nwhich they respectively move coincide very nearly with the plane in\r\nwhich the earth revolves. We must suppose all the orbits of our\r\nimaginary system to be flattened down, nearly into a plane, before we\r\ncan transform the imaginary system of planets I have described into the\r\nsemblance of an actual solar system.\r\n\r\nIf the orbits of the planets had been arranged in planes which were\r\nplaced at random, we may presume they would have been inclined at very\r\nvaried angles. As they are not so disposed, we may conclude that the\r\nplanes have not been put down at random; we must conclude that there has\r\nbeen some cause in action which, if we may so describe it, has\r\nsuperintended the planes of these orbits and ordained that they should\r\nbe placed in a very particular manner.\r\n\r\nTwo planets’ orbits might conceivably coincide or be perpendicular, or\r\nthey might contain any intermediate angle. The plane of the second\r\nplanet might be inclined to the first at an angle containing any number\r\nof degrees. To make some numerical estimate of the matter, we proceed as\r\nfollows: If we divide the right angle into ten parts of nine degrees\r\neach (Fig. 47), then the inclination of the two planes might, for\r\nexample, lie between O° and 9°, or between 18° and 27°, or between 45°\r\nand 54°, or between 81° and 90°, or in any one of the ten divisions. Let\r\nus think of the orbit of Jupiter. Then the inclination of the plane in\r\nwhich it moves to the plane in which the earth moves must fall into one\r\nof the ten divisions. As a matter of fact, it does fall into the angle\r\nbetween 0° and 9°.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.—A RIGHT ANGLE DIVIDED INTO TEN PARTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now let us consider a second planet, for example Venus. If the orbit\r\nof Venus were to be placed at random, its inclination might with equal\r\nprobability lie in any one of the ten divisions, each of nine degrees,\r\ninto which we have divided the right angle. It would be just as likely\r\nto lie between forty-five and fifty-four, or between seventy-two and\r\neighty-one, as in any other division. But we find another curious\r\ncoincidence. It was already remarkable that the plane of Jupiter’s orbit\r\nshould have been included in the first angle of nine degrees from the\r\norbit of the earth. It is therefore specially noteworthy to find that\r\nthe planet Venus follows the same law, though each one of the ten\r\nangular divisions was equally available.\r\n\r\nThe coincidences we have mentioned, remarkable as they are, represent\r\nonly the first of the series. What has been said with respect to the\r\npositions of the orbits of Jupiter and Venus may be repeated with regard\r\nto the orbits of Mercury and Mars, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. If the\r\ntracks of these planets had been placed merely at random, their\r\ninclinations would have been equally likely to fall into any of the ten\r\ndivisions. As a matter of fact, they all agree in choosing that one\r\nparticular division which is adjacent to the track of the earth. If the\r\norbits of the planets had indeed been arranged fortuitously, it is\r\nalmost inconceivable that such coincidences could have occurred. Let me\r\nillustrate the matter by the following little parable.\r\n\r\nThere were seven classes in a school, and there were ten boys in each\r\nclass. There was one boy named Smith in the first class, but only one.\r\nThere was also one Smith, but only one, in each of the other classes.\r\nThe others were named Brown, Jones, Robinson, etc. An old boy, named\r\nCaptain Smith, who had gone out to Australia many years before, came\r\nback to visit his old school. He had succeeded well in the world, and he\r\nwanted to do something generous for the boys at the place of which he\r\nhad such kindly recollections. He determined to give a plum-cake to one\r\nboy in each class; and the fortunate boy was to be chosen by lot. The\r\nten boys in each class were to draw, and each successful boy was to be\r\nsent in to Captain Smith to receive his cake.\r\n\r\nThe Captain sat at a table, and the seven winners were shown in to\r\nreceive their prizes. “What is your name?” he said to the boy in the\r\nfirst class, as he shook hands with him. “Smith,” replied the boy. “Dear\r\nme,” said the Captain, “how odd that our names should be the same. Never\r\nmind, it’s a good name. Here’s your cake. Good-bye, Smith.” Then up came\r\nthe boy from the second class. “What is your name?” said the Captain.\r\n“Smith, sir,” was the reply. “Dear me,” said the visitor. “This is very\r\nsingular. It is indeed a very curious coincidence that two Smiths should\r\nhave succeeded. Were you really chosen by drawing lots?” “Yes, sir,”\r\nsaid the boy. “Then are all the boys in your class named Smith?” “No,\r\nsir; I’m the only one of that name in the ten.” “Well,” said the\r\nCaptain, “it really is most curious. I never heard anything so\r\nextraordinary as that two namesakes of my own should happen to be the\r\nwinners. Now then for the boy from class three.” A cheerful youth\r\nadvanced with a smile. “Well, at all events,” said the good-natured old\r\nboy, “your name is not Smith?” “Oh, but it is,” said the youth. The\r\ngallant Captain jumped up, and declared that there must have been some\r\ntremendous imposition. Either the whole school consisted of Smiths, or\r\nthey called themselves Smiths, or they had picked out the Smiths. The\r\nfour remaining boys, still expecting their cakes, here burst out\r\nlaughing. “What are your names?” shouted the donor. “Smith!” “Smith!!”\r\n“Smith!!!” “Smith!!!!” were the astounding replies. The good man could\r\nstand this no longer. He sent for the schoolmaster, and said, “I\r\nparticularly requested that you would choose a boy drawn by lot from\r\neach of your seven classes, but you have not done so. You have merely\r\npicked out my namesakes and sent them up for the cakes.” But the master\r\nreplied, “No, I assure you, they have been honestly chosen by lot. Nine\r\nblack beans and one white bean were placed in a bag; each class of ten\r\nthen drew in succession, and in each class it happened that the boy\r\nnamed Smith drew the white bean.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the visitor, “this is not credible. Only once in ten million\r\ntimes would all the seven Smiths have drawn the white beans if left\r\nsolely to chance. And do you mean to tell me that what can happen only\r\nonce out of ten million times did actually happen on this occasion—the\r\nonly occasion in my life on which I have attempted such a thing? I don’t\r\nbelieve the drawing was made fairly by lot. There must have been some\r\ninterference with the operation of chance. I insist on having the lots\r\ndrawn again under my own inspection.” “Yes, yes,” shouted all the other\r\nboys. But all the successful Smiths roared out, “No.” They did not feel\r\nat all desirous of another trial. They knew enough of the theory of\r\nprobabilities to be aware that they might wait till another ten million\r\nfortunate old boys came back to the school before they would have such\r\nluck again. The situation came to a deadlock. The Captain protested that\r\nsome fraud had been perpetrated, and in spite of their assurances he\r\nwould not believe them. The seven Smiths declared they had won their\r\ncakes honestly, and that they would not surrender them. The Captain was\r\ngetting furious, the boys were on the point of rebellion, when the\r\nschoolmaster’s wife, alarmed by the tumult, came on the scene. She asked\r\nwhat was the cause of the disturbance. It was explained to her, and then\r\nCaptain Smith added that by mathematical probabilities it was almost\r\ninconceivable that the only seven Smiths in the school should have been\r\nchosen. The gracious lady replied that she knew nothing, and cared as\r\nlittle, about the theory of probabilities, but she did care greatly that\r\nthe school should not be thrown into tumult. “There is only one solution\r\nof this difficulty,” she added. “It is that you forthwith provide cakes,\r\nnot only for the seven Smiths, but for every one of the boys in the\r\nschool.” This resolute pronouncement was received with shouts of\r\napproval. The Captain, with a somewhat rueful countenance, acknowledged\r\nthat it only remained for him to comply. He returned, shortly\r\nafterwards, to his gold-diggings in Australia, there to meditate during\r\nhis leisure on this remarkable illustration of the theory of\r\nprobabilities.\r\n\r\nThis parable illustrates the improbability of such arrangements as we\r\nfind in the planets having originated by chance. The chances against\r\ntheir having thus occurred are 10,000,000 to 1. Hence we find it\r\nreasonable to come to the conclusion that the arrangement, by which the\r\nplanets move round the sun in planes which are nearly coincident, cannot\r\nhave originated by chance. There must have been some cause which\r\nproduced this special disposition. We have, therefore, to search for\r\nsome common cause which must have operated on all the planets. As the\r\nplanets are at present absolutely separated from each other, it is\r\nimpossible for us to conceive a common cause acting upon them in their\r\npresent condition. The cause must have operated at some primæval time,\r\nbefore the planets assumed the separate individual existence that they\r\nnow have.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken so far of the great planets only, and we have seen how\r\nthe probability stands. We should also remark that there are also nearly\r\n500 small planets, or asteroids, as they are more generally called.\r\nAmong them are, no doubt, a few whose orbits have inclinations to the\r\necliptic larger than those of the great planets. The great majority of\r\nthe asteroids revolve, however, very close to that remarkable plane with\r\nwhich the orbits of the great planets so nearly coincide. Every one of\r\nthese asteroids increases the improbability that the planes of the\r\norbits could have been arranged as we find them, without some special\r\ndisposing cause. It is not possible or necessary to write down the exact\r\nfigures. The probability is absolutely overwhelming against such an\r\narrangement being found if the orbits of the planets had been decided by\r\nchance, and chance alone.\r\n\r\nWe may feel confident that there must have been some particular\r\ncircumstances accompanying the formation of the solar system which\r\nrendered it absolutely necessary for the orbits of the planets to\r\npossess this particular characteristic. We have pointed out in Chapter\r\nXII. that the nebular theory offers such an explanation, and we do not\r\nknow of any other natural explanation which would be worthy of serious\r\nattention. Indeed, we may say that no other such explanation has ever\r\nbeen offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                          THE SECOND CONCORD.\r\n\r\nAnother Remarkable Coincidence in the Solar System—The Second\r\n    Concord—The Direction of the Movements of the Great Planets—The\r\n    Movement of Ceres—Yet Another Planet—Discovery of Eros—The Nearest\r\n    Neighbour of the Earth—Throwing Heads and Tails—A Calculation of the\r\n    Chances—The Numerical Strength of the Argument—An Illustration of\r\n    the Probability of the Origin of the Solar System from the\r\n    Nebula—The Explanation of the Second Concord offered by the Nebular\r\n    Theory—The Relation of Energy and Moment of Momentum—Different\r\n    Systems Illustrated—That all the Movements should be in the same\r\n    Direction is a Consequence of Evolution from the Primæval Nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen in the last chapter that there is a very remarkable\r\nconcordance in the positions of the planes of the orbits of the planets,\r\nand we have shown that this concordance finds a natural historical\r\nexplanation in the nebular origin of our system. We have now to consider\r\nanother striking concord in the movements of the planets in their\r\nseveral orbits, and this also furnishes us with important evidence as to\r\nthe truth of the nebular theory. The argument on which we are now to\r\nenter is one which specially appealed to Laplace, and was put forward by\r\nhim as the main foundation of the nebular theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.—ILLUSTRATION OF THE SECOND CONCORD.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining Fig. 48 we have a diagram of a portion of the solar\r\nsystem. We shall regard the movements as somewhat simplified. The sun is\r\nsupposed to be at the centre, turning round once every twenty-five days,\r\non an axis which is supposed to be perpendicular to the plane of the\r\npaper. We may also for our present purpose assume that the orbits of the\r\nearth and the other planets lie in this same plane.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we observe that the earth might have gone round its\r\ntrack in either direction so far as the welfare of mankind is concerned.\r\nThe succession of day and night, and the due changes of the seasons,\r\ncould have been equally well secured whichever be the direction in which\r\nthe earth revolves. We do, however, most certainly find that the\r\ndirection in which the earth revolves round the sun is the same as the\r\ndirection in which the sun rotates on its axis. This is the first\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider other planets. Look, for instance, at the orbit of\r\nJupiter. It seems obvious that Jupiter might have been made to revolve\r\nround the sun either one way or the other; indeed, it will be remembered\r\nthat though Kepler’s laws indicate so particularly the shape of the\r\ntrack in which the planet revolves, and prescribe so beautifully the way\r\nin which the planet must moderate or accelerate its velocity at the\r\ndifferent parts of its track, yet they are quite silent as to the\r\ndirection in which the planets shall revolve in that track. If we could\r\nimagine a planet to be stopped to have its velocity reversed, and then\r\nto be started in a precisely opposite direction, it would still continue\r\nto describe precisely the same path; it would still obey Kepler’s laws\r\nwith unfailing accuracy, so far as our present argument is concerned,\r\nand the velocity which it would have at each point of the track would be\r\nquite the same whether the planet were going one way or whether it was\r\ngoing the other. It is therefore equally possible for Jupiter to pursue\r\nhis actual track by going round the sun in the same direction as the\r\nearth, or by going in the opposite direction. But we actually find that\r\nJupiter does take the same direction as the earth, and this, as we have\r\nalready seen, is the direction in which the sun rotates. Here we have\r\nthe second coincidence.\r\n\r\nWe now take another planet; for example, Mars. Again we affirm that Mars\r\ncould have moved in either direction, but, as a matter of fact, it\r\npursues the same direction as Jupiter and the earth. In the orbital\r\nmovement of Saturn we have the fourth coincidence of the same kind, and\r\nwe have a fifth in the case of Mercury, and a sixth in Venus, a seventh\r\nin Uranus, and an eighth in Neptune. The seven great planets and the\r\nearth all revolve around the sun, not only in orbits which are very\r\nnearly in the same plane, but they also revolve in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe coincidences we have pointed out with regard to the movements of the\r\ngreat planets of our system may be also observed with regard to the\r\nnumerous bodies of asteroids. On the first night of the century just\r\nclosed, the 1st of January, 1801, the first of the asteroids, now known\r\nas Ceres, was discovered. This was a small planet, not a thousandth part\r\nof the bulk of one of the older planets, and visible, of course, only in\r\nthe telescope. Like the older planets, it was found to obey Kepler’s\r\nlaws; but this we might have foreseen, because Kepler’s laws depend upon\r\nthe attraction of gravitation, and must apply to any planet, whatever\r\nits size. When, therefore, the new planet was found, and its track was\r\nknown, it was of much interest to see whether the planet in moving round\r\nthat track observed the same direction in which all the older planets\r\nhad agreed to travel, or whether it moved in the opposite direction. In\r\nthe orbit of Ceres we have a repetition of the coincidence which has\r\nbeen noticed in each of the other planets. The new planets, like all the\r\nrest, move round the sun in the same direction as the sun rotates on its\r\naxis. The discovery of this first asteroid was quickly followed by other\r\nsimilar discoveries; each of the new planets described, of course, an\r\nellipse, and the directions which these planets followed in their\r\nmovements round the sun were in absolute harmony with those of the older\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the great planets and the asteroids properly so called,\r\nthere is yet another planet, Eros. Its testimony is of special value,\r\ninasmuch as it seems to stand apart from all other bodies in the solar\r\nsystem, and with, of course, the exception of the moon, it is the\r\nearth’s nearest neighbour. But whatever may be the exceptional features\r\nof Eros, however it may differ from the great planets and the asteroids\r\nalready known, yet Eros makes no exception to the law which we have\r\nfound to be obeyed by all the other planets. It also revolves round the\r\nsun in the same direction as all the planets revolve, in the same\r\ndirection as the rotation of the sun (Fig. 49).\r\n\r\nWe may pause at this moment to make a calculation as to the\r\nimprobability that the sun, the earth, the seven great planets, and\r\nCeres, numbering altogether ten, should move round in the same direction\r\nif their movements had been left to chance. This will show what we can\r\nreasonably infer from this concord in their movements. The theory of\r\nprobabilities will again enlighten a difficult subject.\r\n\r\nThere are only two possible directions for the motion of a planet in its\r\norbit. It must move like the hands of a watch, or it must move in the\r\nopposite direction. The planet must move one way or the other, just as a\r\npenny must always fall head or tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.—ORBITS OF EARTH, EROS AND MARS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may illustrate this remarkable coincidence in the following manner:\r\nSuppose we take ten coins in the hand, and toss them all up together and\r\nlet them fall on the table; in the vast majority of cases in which the\r\nexperiment may be tried, there would be some heads and some tails; they\r\nwould not all be heads. But it is, of course, not impossible that the\r\ncoins should all turn up heads. We should, however, deem it a very\r\nremarkable circumstance if it happened: yet it would certainly not be\r\nmore remarkable than that the ten celestial movements should all take\r\nplace in the same direction, unless, indeed, it should turn out that\r\nthere is some sound physical cause which imposes on the planets of the\r\nsolar system an obligation, restricting their movements round the sun to\r\nthe same direction as that in which the sun itself rotates.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful to study the matter numerically; and the rules of\r\nprobabilities will enable us to do so, as we may see by the following\r\nillustration: We deem the captain of a cricket team fortunate when he\r\nwins the toss for innings. We should deem him lucky indeed if he won it\r\nthree times in successive matches. If he won it five times running, his\r\nluck would be phenomenal; while, if it was stated that he won it ten\r\ntimes consecutively, we should consider the statement well-nigh\r\nincredible. For it is easy to calculate that the chances against such an\r\noccurrence are one thousand and twenty-four to one. In like manner we\r\nmay say, that for nine planets and the sun all to go round in the same\r\ndirection would be indeed surprising if the arrangement of the planets\r\nhad been determined by chance; there are more than a thousand chances to\r\none against such an occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut Ceres was only the earliest of many other similar discoveries. And\r\nas each asteroid was successively brought to light, it became most\r\ninteresting to test whether it followed the rest of the planets in that\r\nwonderful unanimity in the direction of their movements of revolution,\r\nor whether it made a new departure by going in the opposite direction.\r\nNo such exception has ever yet been observed. Let us take, then, ten\r\nmore planets, in addition to those we have already considered, so that\r\nwe have now nineteen planets all revolving in the same direction as the\r\nsun rotates. It is easy to compute the improbability that these twenty\r\nmovements should all be in the same direction, if, indeed, it were by\r\nchance that their directions had been determined. It is the same problem\r\nas the following: What is the chance that twenty coins, taken together\r\nin the hand and tossed into the air at once, shall all alight with their\r\nheads uppermost? We have seen that the chances against this occurrence,\r\nif there were ten coins, is about a thousand to one. It can easily be\r\nshown that if there were twenty coins the chances against the occurrence\r\nwould be a million to one. We thus see that, even with no more than\r\nnineteen planets and the sun, there is a million to one against a\r\nunanimity in the directions of the movements, if the determination of\r\nthe motions was made by chance. We may, however, express the result in a\r\ndifferent manner, which is more to the purpose of our argument. There\r\nare a million chances to one in favour of the supposition that the\r\ndisposition of the movements of the planets has not been the result of\r\nchance; or we may say that there are a million chances to one in favour\r\nof the supposition that some physical agent has caused the unanimity.\r\n\r\nWe can add almost any desired amount of numerical strength to the\r\nargument. The discoveries of minor planets went on with ever-increasing\r\nsuccess through the whole of the last century. When ten more had been\r\nfound, and when each one was shown to obey the same invisible guide as\r\nto the direction in which it should pursue its elliptic orbit, the\r\nchances in favour of some physical cause for the unanimity became\r\nmultiplied by yet another thousand. The probability then stood at a\r\nthousand millions to one. As the years rolled by, asteroids were found\r\nin ever-increasing abundance. Sometimes a single astronomer discovered\r\ntwo, and sometimes even more than two, on a single night. In the course\r\nof a lifetime a diligent astronomer has placed fifty discoveries of\r\nasteroids, or even more than fifty, on his record. By combined efforts\r\nthe tale of the asteroids has now approached five hundred, and out of\r\nthat huge number of independent planetary bodies there is not one single\r\ndissentient in the direction of its motion. Without any exception\r\nwhatever, they all perform their revolutions in the same direction as\r\nthe sun rotates at the centre. When this great host is considered, the\r\nnumerical strength of the argument would require about 150 figures for\r\nexpression. Each new asteroid simply doubled the strength of the\r\nargument as it stood before.\r\n\r\nProfessor J. J. Thomson recently discovered that there are corpuscles of\r\nmatter very much smaller than atoms. Let us think of one of these\r\ncorpuscles, of which many millions would be required to make the\r\nsmallest grain of sand which would just be visible under a microscope.\r\nThink, on the other hand, of a sphere extending through space to so vast\r\na distance that every star in the Milky Way will be contained within its\r\ncompass. Then the number of those corpuscles which would be required to\r\nfill that sphere is still far too small to represent the hugeness of the\r\nimprobability that all the five hundred planetary bodies should revolve\r\nin the same direction, if chance, and chance alone, had guided the\r\ndirection which each planet was to pursue in moving round its orbit.\r\n\r\nThe mere statement of these facts is sufficient to show that some\r\nphysical agent must have caused this marvellous concord in the movements\r\nof the solar system. How the argument would have stood if there had been\r\neven a single dissentient it is not necessary to consider, for there is\r\nno dissentient No reasonable person will deny that these facts impose an\r\nobligation to search for the physical explanation of this feature in the\r\nplanetary movements.\r\n\r\nAs in the last chapter, where we were dealing with the positions of the\r\nplanes of the orbits, there can here be no hesitation as to the true\r\ncause of this most striking characteristic of the planetary movements.\r\nThe nebular theory is at once ready with an explanation, as has been\r\nalready indicated in Chapter XI. The primæval nebula, endowed in the\r\nbeginning with a certain amount of moment of momentum, has been\r\ngradually contracting. It has been gradually expending its energy, as we\r\nhave already had occasion to explain; but the moment of momentum has\r\nremained undiminished. And from this it can be shown that the dynamical\r\nprinciples guiding the evolution of the nebula must ultimately refuse\r\npermission for any planet to revolve in opposition to the general\r\nmovement. This point is a very interesting one, and as it is of very\r\ngreat importance in connection with our system, I must give it some\r\nfurther illustration and explanation.\r\n\r\nThe two figures that are shown in Fig. 50 represent two imaginary\r\nsystems. We have a sun in each, and we have two planets in each. The sun\r\nis marked with the letter S, and the two planets are designated by A and\r\nB. For simplicity I have represented the orbits as circles, and for the\r\nsame reason I have left out the rest of the planets; we shall also\r\nsuppose the orbits of the two planets that are involved to lie exactly\r\nin the same plane. In the two systems that I have here supposed, the two\r\nsuns are to be of the same weight, the planet A in one system is of\r\nequal mass to the planet A in the other; and the planets B in the two\r\nsystems are also equal. It is also assumed that the orbit of A in one\r\ndiagram shall be the same as the orbit of A in the other, and that the\r\norbit of B in one shall be precisely the same as the orbit of B in the\r\nother. The sun rotates in precisely the same manner in both, and takes\r\nthe same time for each rotation. A, in one system, goes round in the\r\nsame time that A does in the other; and B, in one system, goes round in\r\nthe same time that B does in the other. There is, therefore, a perfect\r\nresemblance between the two systems I have here supposed in every point\r\nbut one. I have indicated, as usual, the movements of the bodies by\r\narrows, and, while in one of the systems the sun and A and B all go\r\nround in the same direction, in the other system the sun and A go round,\r\nno doubt, in the same direction, but the direction of B is opposite. We\r\nare not, in this illustration, considering the rotations of the planets\r\non their axes. That will be dealt with in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.—I. A NATURAL SYSTEM ON THE LEFT.\r\nII. AN UNNATURAL SYSTEM ON THE RIGHT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that either of these two systems would be possible\r\nfor thousands of revolutions. There is nothing whatever to prevent A and\r\nB from being started in the same direction round the sun as in the first\r\nfigure, or with A in one direction and B in the opposite direction, as\r\nin the second figure. It is equally conceivable that, while A and B\r\nrevolve in the same direction, both should be opposite to that of the\r\nsun. But one system is permanent, and the other is not.\r\n\r\nFor, as a matter of fact, we do not find in Nature such an arrangement\r\nas that in the second figure, or as that in which both the planets\r\nrevolve in opposite directions to the sun’s rotation; what we do find\r\nis, that the planets go round in the same direction as the sun. And the\r\nexplanation is undoubtedly connected with the important principle\r\nalready illustrated, namely, that natural systems are in a condition in\r\nwhich the total quantity of energy undergoes continuous reduction in\r\ncomparison with the moment of momentum.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangements made in the two figures, it will be recollected that\r\nthe masses of the three bodies were respectively the same, and also\r\ntheir distances apart, and their velocities. As the energy depends only\r\non the masses, the distances, and the velocities, the energies of the\r\ntwo systems must be identical. But the moment of momentum of the two\r\nsystems is very different, for while in the one case the sum of the\r\nmoments of momentum of the sun’s rotation and that of the planet A,\r\nwhich is going in the same direction, are to be _increased_ by the\r\nmoment of momentum of B, the same is not the case in the other system.\r\nThe moment of momentum of the sun and of A conspire, no doubt, and must\r\nbe added together; but as B is revolving in the opposite direction, the\r\nmoment of momentum of this planet has to be subtracted before we obtain\r\nthe nett moment of momentum of the system. Hence, we perceive a\r\nremarkable difference between the two systems; for, though in each the\r\ntotal energy is the same, yet in the latter case the moment of momentum\r\nis smaller than in the former.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the effect of the mutual actions of the\r\ndifferent bodies of a system is to lessen, in course of time, the total\r\nquantity of energy that they receive in the beginning, while it is not\r\nin the power of the mutual actions of the particles of the system to\r\naffect the sum total of the moment of momentum. Hence we see that, so\r\nlong as the system is isolated from external interference, the tendency\r\nmust ever be towards the reduction of the quantity of energy to as low a\r\npoint as may be compatible with the preservation of the necessary amount\r\nof moment of momentum. The first of the two systems given in Fig. 50 is\r\nmuch more in conformity with this principle than the second. The moment\r\nof momentum in the former case must be nearly as large as could be\r\nobtained by any other disposition of the matter forming it, with the\r\nsame amount of energy. But in the second diagram the moment of momentum\r\nis much less, though the energy is the same. It follows that the energy\r\nof this system might be largely reduced, for if accompanied by a\r\nsuitable rearrangement of the planets the reduced amount of moment of\r\nmomentum might be easily provided for. We thus see that this system is\r\nnot one to which the evolution of a material arrangement would\r\nultimately tend. It is, therefore, not to be expected in Nature, and we\r\ndo not find it. Of course, the same would be equally true if, instead of\r\nhaving merely two planets, as I have here supposed for the sake of\r\nillustration, the planets were much more numerous. The operation of the\r\ncauses we have been considering will show that, in the evolution of such\r\na system, there will be a tendency for the planets to revolve in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how, in the contraction of the original nebula, there\r\nmust have been a strong influence to check and efface any movements\r\nantagonistic to the general direction of the rotation of the nebula. If\r\nparticles revolve in a direction opposite to the current pursued by the\r\nmajority of particles, there would be collisions and frictions, and\r\nthese collisions and frictions will, of course, find expression in the\r\nproduction of equivalent quantities of heat. That heat will, in due\r\ncourse, be radiated away at the expense of the energy of the system, and\r\nconsequently, so long as any contrary movements exist, there will be an\r\nexceptional loss of energy from this cause. Thus the energy would\r\nincessantly tend to decline. As the shrinking of the body proceeded\r\nwhile the moment of momentum would have to be sustained, this would\r\nincessantly tend more and more to require from all the particles a\r\nmovement in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe second concord of the planetary system, which is implied in the fact\r\nthat all the planets go round in the same direction, need not therefore\r\nsurprise us. It is a consequence, an inevitable consequence, of the\r\nevolution of that system from the great primæval nebula. We have seen\r\nthat it would be excessively improbable that even nine or ten planets\r\nshould revolve round the sun in the same direction, if the directions of\r\ntheir movements had been merely decided by chance. We have seen that the\r\nmovements of the hosts of planets, which actually form our system, would\r\nbe inconceivable, unless there were some reason for those movements. The\r\nchances against such an arrangement having arisen without some\r\npredisposing cause is so vast that, even if the chances were infinite,\r\nthe case would be hardly strengthened. But once we grant that the system\r\noriginated from the contraction of the primæval nebula, dynamics offers\r\nready aid, and the difficulty vanishes. Not only do we see most\r\nexcellent reasons why all the planets should revolve in the same\r\ndirection; we are also provided with illustrations of similar evolutions\r\nin progress in other parts of the universe; we learn that the evolving\r\nnebula, however erratic may have been its primitive motion, whatever\r\ncross currents may have agitated it in the early phases of a possibly\r\nviolent origin, will ultimately attain a rotation uniform in direction.\r\nAs the evolution proceeds, the various parts of the nebula draw together\r\nto form the planets of the future system, and the planets retain the\r\nmovement possessed by their component particles. Thus we see that the\r\nnebular theory not only extricates us from the difficulty of trying to\r\nexplain something which seemed almost infinitely improbable, but it also\r\nshows why no other disposition of the motions than that which we\r\nactually find could be expected. The nebular theory explains to us why\r\nthere is no exception to that fundamental law in the solar system which\r\ndeclares that the orbits of the planets shall all be followed in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful agreement in the movements of the planets, which we have\r\ncalled the second concord, thus affords us striking evidence of the\r\ngeneral truth of the nebular theory. But there is yet a third concord in\r\nthe solar system which, like the other two, lends wonderful\r\ncorroboration to the sublime doctrine of Kant and Laplace. This we shall\r\nconsider in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                           THE THIRD CONCORD.\r\n\r\nRotations of the Planets on their Axes.—The Older Planets—No Information\r\n    about Uranus or Neptune or the Asteroids—The Speed of Rotation is\r\n    Arbitrary so far as Kepler’s Laws are concerned—The Third Concord—A\r\n    Remarkable Unanimity—Kant’s Argument—Illustration of the Rotation of\r\n    the Moon on its Axis—How the Nebular Theory explains the\r\n    Rotation—The Moon’s Evolution—Special Action of Tides—The Evolution\r\n    of the other Satellites—The case of Mars—Jupiter and Saturn as\r\n    Miniatures of the Solar System—Uranus and Neptune offer\r\n    Difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen in the last chapter how the rotation of the sun beat time,\r\nas it were, for the planets, by giving to them an indication of the\r\ndirection in which the revolutions round the sun should be performed,\r\nand we have observed with what marvellous unanimity the planets follow\r\nthe precept thus given. We have now to consider yet another concord,\r\nwhich has perhaps not the great numerical strength of that last\r\nconsidered, but is, nevertheless, worthy of our most special attention.\r\nThe earth revolves about an axis which is not very far from being\r\nperpendicular to the principal plane to which the movements of the solar\r\nsystem are related. From a dynamical point of view it would, of course,\r\nhave been equally possible for the earth to revolve on its axis in the\r\nsame direction as the rotation of the sun, or in the opposite direction.\r\nThere is nothing so far as the welfare of man is concerned to make one\r\ndirection of rotation preferable to the other, but, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe earth does turn round in the same way as the sun turns.\r\n\r\nJupiter also turns on its axis, and Jupiter again, like the earth, might\r\nturn either with the sun or it might turn in the opposite direction.\r\nHere, again, we find a unanimity between the earth and Jupiter; they\r\nboth turn in the same direction, and that is the direction in which the\r\nsun rotates. The same may be said of Mars, and the same may be said of\r\nSaturn. In the case of the planets Mercury and Venus we cannot speak\r\nwith equal definiteness on the subject of their rotations about their\r\naxes. The circumstances of these planets are such that there are great\r\ndifficulties attending the exact telescopic determination of their\r\nperiods of rotation. The widest variations appear in the periods which\r\nhave been assigned. It has, for instance, been believed that Venus\r\nrotates in a period not greatly differing from the period of twenty-four\r\nhours in which our earth revolves. But it has been lately supposed that\r\nthe period of Venus is very much longer, and is in fact no less than\r\nseven months, which is, indeed, that of the revolution of Venus about\r\nthe sun. According to this view, Venus rotates round the sun in a period\r\nequal to its revolution. If this be so, then Venus constantly turns the\r\nsame face to the sun, and the movement of the planet would thus resemble\r\nthe movement of the moon around the earth. As a matter of observation,\r\nthe question must still be considered unsettled, though there are sound\r\ndynamical reasons for believing that the long period is much more\r\nprobable than the short one. We do not now enter into this question, or\r\ninto the still more difficult matter of the rotation of Mercury; it\r\nsuffices to say that whichever period be adopted for either of these\r\nplanets is really not material to our present argument. In both cases it\r\nhas never been doubted that the direction of the rotation of the planets\r\nis the same as the direction in which Jupiter and Mars and the earth\r\nrotate, these being also the same as the direction of the solar\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\nAs to the rotations of Uranus and Neptune about their respective axes,\r\nthe telescope can show us nothing. The remoteness of both these planets\r\nis such that we are unable to discern objects on their discs with the\r\ndefiniteness that would be required if we desired to watch their\r\nrotations. We have also no information as to the rotation of the several\r\nasteroids. No one, I think, will doubt that each of these small planets,\r\nequally with the large planets, does rotate about its axis; but it is\r\nimpossible for us to say so from actual knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut undoubtedly the five old planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and\r\nSaturn, as well as the earth, all rotate in the same direction as the\r\nsun. Each planet might rotate twice as fast, or half as fast, as it does\r\nat present. They might all rotate in the opposite direction from that in\r\nwhich they do now, or some of them might go in one direction, and some\r\nin the other, with every variety in their diurnal periods, while the\r\nprimary condition of Kepler’s Laws would have still been complied with.\r\nWe may also note that the _direction_ in which the rotation takes place\r\nseems quite immaterial so far as the welfare of the inhabitants on these\r\nplanets is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the planets and the sun have this third concord demands\r\nspecial attention. The chance that the earth should rotate in the same\r\ndirection as the sun is, of course, expressed by one-half. It is easy to\r\nshow, that out of sixty-four possible arrangements of the directions of\r\nrotation of the five planets and the earth, there would be only one in\r\nwhich all the movements coincided with the direction of the rotation of\r\nthe sun. If, therefore, it had been by chance that the direction of\r\nthese motions was determined, then Nature would have taken a course of\r\nwhich the probability was only one sixty-fourth. No doubt this figure is\r\nby no means so large as those which expressed the probabilities of the\r\nother planetary concords; it is, however, quite sufficient to convince\r\nus that the direction of the rotation of the planets on their axes has\r\nnot been determined merely by the operation of chance.\r\n\r\nWe are to see if there is any physical agent by which the planets have\r\nbeen forced to turn round in the same direction. And here comes in one\r\nof those subtle points which the metaphysical genius of Kant suggested.\r\nLet us take any two planets—say, for instance, the earth and Jupiter—and\r\nlet us endeavour to see what the nature of the agent must have been\r\nwhich has operated on these planets so as to make them both rotate in\r\nthe same direction. Kant urged that there must have been some material\r\nagent working on the materials in Jupiter, and some material agent\r\nworking on those of the earth, and that to produce the like effect in\r\neach planet there must have been at one time a material connection\r\nexisting between that body which is now Jupiter and that body which is\r\nnow the earth. In like manner Kant saw this material connection existing\r\nbetween the other planets and the sun, and thus he was led to see that\r\nthe whole material of our solar system must once have formed a more or\r\nless continuous object. The argument is a delicate one, but it seems\r\ncertainly true that in the present arrangement of the orbits it is\r\nimpossible for us to conceive how, with intervals of empty space between\r\nthe tracks of the planets, a common influence can have been exerted so\r\nas to give them all rotations in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe nebular theory at once supplies the explanation of the unanimity in\r\nthe rotation of the planets, just as it supplied the explanation of the\r\nunanimity in the directions of their revolutions. To explain the\r\nrotation of a planet on its axis, let us imagine that one portion of the\r\ncontracting nebula has acquired exceptional density. In virtue of its\r\nsuperior attraction it absorbs more and more material from the adjacent\r\nparts of the nebula, and this will ultimately be consolidated into the\r\nplanet, though in its initial stages this contracting matter will remain\r\npart of the nebula. We have shown that the law which decrees that the\r\nmoment of momentum must remain constant will require that, after a\r\ncertain advance in the contraction, all the parts of the nebula shall\r\nrotate in the same direction. Thus we find that the sun, or rather the\r\nparts of the nebula that are to form the sun, and the parts that are to\r\nform the planets are all turning round together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.—AN ELONGATED IRREGULAR NEBULA\r\n(n.g.c. 6992; in Cygnus). (_Dr. W. E. Wilson, F.R.S._)\r\n(_From the Astronomical and Physical Researches at Daramona\r\nObservatory._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point we may consider a geometrical principle which, though\r\nreally quite simple, is not always easily understood. It has indeed\r\npresented considerable difficulty to many people. Suppose that an\r\nordinary card is laid on a flat board, and that, with a bradawl, a hole\r\nis made through the card into the board. The hole may be at the centre,\r\nor at one of the corners, or a little way in from one of the edges, or\r\nin any other position whatever on the card. Now suppose that a postage\r\nstamp is stuck upon the card anywhere, and that the card is then moved\r\naround the bradawl. How are we to describe the motion of that postage\r\nstamp? It would certainly be revolving around the bradawl; but this\r\nmotion we may consider as composed of two others. At any instant we may\r\naccurately represent the movement of the postage stamp by considering\r\nthat its centre was moving in a direction perpendicular to the line\r\njoining that centre to the hole made by the bradawl, and that it also\r\nhad a rotation around its centre, the period of that rotation being just\r\nthe same as the time the card would take to go round the bradawl. Thus\r\nwe see that the movement of the postage stamp contains at any moment a\r\nmovement of translation and a movement of rotation.\r\n\r\nWe may illustrate the case we have supposed by the movement of the moon\r\naround the earth. If the centre of the earth be considered to be at the\r\ncentre of rotation the moon may be considered to be in the position of\r\nthe postage stamp. As our satellite revolves, the same side of the moon\r\nis continually turned towards the earth, but this is due to the fact\r\nthat the moon, at each moment, really possesses two movements, namely, a\r\nmovement of translation of its centre, in a direction perpendicular to\r\nthe line from the moon’s centre to the earth’s centre, coupled with a\r\nslow rotation of the moon round its axis.\r\n\r\nThe contracting nebula we may liken to our piece of cardboard, the stamp\r\nwill represent the spot in which the nebulous material has contracted to\r\nform the planet, and the position of the bradawl is the centre of the\r\nsun. As we have seen by our illustration, the nebulous planet is endowed\r\nwith a certain movement of rotation, the period of its rotation on its\r\naxis being equal to that of its revolution around the centre; and it is\r\nimportant also to notice that both these movements take place in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nThus we see from the nebular theory how the primæval nebula, in the\r\ncourse of its contraction, originated a planet, and how that planet was\r\nalso endowed with a movement of rotation; its period of rotation being\r\noriginally equal to the period of rotation of the whole nebula. This\r\nexplains how the planet, or rather the materials which are to form the\r\nfuture planet, derived from the nebula their movement of rotation, which\r\nmust have been extremely slow in the beginning. As the contraction\r\ncontinued, the materials of the gradually growing globe drew themselves\r\ntogether, and tended to become separate from the surrounding nebula. At\r\nlength the time arrived when the planet became sufficiently isolated\r\nfrom the rest of the nebula to permit the conservation of moment of\r\nmomentum to be applied to it individually. Thus, though the rotation was\r\nat first excessively slow, yet, as the contraction proceeded, and as the\r\nparts of the forming planet drew themselves closer together, in\r\nconsequence of their mutual attractions, it became necessary that the\r\nspeed with which these parts accomplished their revolutions should be\r\naccelerated. At last, when the planet had become consolidated, and when\r\nconsequently the mutual distances of the several particles constituting\r\nthe planet had been reduced to but a fraction of what those distances\r\nwere originally, the speed of the planet’s rotation had become\r\nenormously increased. In this manner we learn how, from the very slow\r\nrotation which the nebulous material had at first, a solid planet may be\r\nmade to rotate on its axis as rapidly as the planets in the solar system\r\ndo to-day.\r\n\r\nWe thus find that the third concord, namely, the agreement in the\r\ndirections of the planets’ rotations, is a further strong corroboration\r\nof the nebular theory. The unanimity of all these various movements is\r\nthe dominant characteristic of the solar system.\r\n\r\nBut this third concord, derived from the rotation of the planets, may be\r\nyet further strengthened. The movements of the satellites, which\r\naccompany so many of the planets, must also find their explanation from\r\nthe primæval nebula. The circumstances of the satellites are, however,\r\ndifferent in the different cases.\r\n\r\nAs regards the moon, the theory of its evolution is now well known,\r\nmainly by the researches of Professor George Darwin. In the moon there\r\nappear to have been causes at work of a somewhat special kind. We must\r\njust refer to what is well known with regard to the history of the moon.\r\nHere, again, we observe the importance of the principles of the\r\nconservation of moment of momentum. As the moon raises tides on the\r\nocean surrounding the earth, and as those tides flow around the globe,\r\nthey cause friction, and that friction involves, as we have so often\r\npointed out, the loss of energy to the system. Thus, the energy of the\r\nearth-moon system must be declining, while the moment of momentum\r\nremains constant. Now there are only two sources from which the energy\r\ncan be derived. One of those sources is that due to the rotation of the\r\nearth on its axis. The other is due to the moon, and consists of two\r\nparts, namely, the energy arising from the velocity of the moon in its\r\norbit, and the energy due to the distance by which the earth is\r\nseparated from the moon. As the moon’s velocity depends upon its\r\ndistance, we cannot view these two portions as independent. They are\r\nconnected together, and we associate them into one. So that we say the\r\ntotal energy of the earth-moon system consists partly of that due to the\r\nrotation of the earth on its axis, and partly of that due to the\r\nrevolution of the moon around the earth. It might also seem that we\r\nought to add to this the energy due to the rotation of the moon around\r\nits own axis; but this is too inconsiderable to need attention. In the\r\nfirst place, the moon is so small that even if it rotated as rapidly as\r\nthe earth the energy due to the rotation would not be important. Seeing,\r\nhowever, that the moon has for the rotation on its axis a period of\r\nbetween twenty-seven and twenty-eight days, its velocity of rotation is\r\nso small that, for this reason also, the energy of rotation would be\r\ninconsiderable. We are, therefore, amply justified in omitting from our\r\npresent consideration the energy due to the rotation of the moon on its\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nThe energy of the earth-moon system is on the decline: the lost energy\r\nmight conceivably be drawn from the rotation of the earth, or it might\r\nbe drawn from the revolution of the moon, or it might be drawn from both\r\nIf it were drawn from the revolution of the moon, that would imply that\r\nthe moon would lose some of its speed or some of its distance, or in any\r\ncase that the moon would get nearer to the earth and revolve more\r\nslowly, the speed of the earth being on this supposition unaltered. In\r\nthis case, the moment of momentum of the earth would remain the same as\r\nbefore, while the moment of momentum of the moon would be lessened; the\r\ntotal moment of momentum would therefore have decreased, but this we\r\nhave seen to be impossible. It therefore follows that the energy\r\nwithdrawn from the earth-moon system is not to be obtained at the\r\nexpense of the revolution of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe energy must therefore be obtained at the expense of the rotation of\r\nthe earth on its axis. But if this be the case, the speed with which the\r\nearth rotates must be diminished; that is to say, the length of the day\r\nmust be increased. And if the speed of the earth’s rotation be reduced,\r\nthat means that the amount of moment of momentum contributed by the\r\nearth is lessened. But the total quantity of moment of momentum must be\r\nsustained, and this can only be done by making the moon go further away\r\nand describe a larger orbit. We thus see that in consequence of the\r\ntides the length of the day must be increasing, and the moon must be\r\ngradually retreating. Thus we find that at earlier periods the moon’s\r\ndistance from the earth must have been less than it is at present, and\r\nthe further we look back through remote periods the less do we find the\r\ndistance between the earth and the moon. Thus we see that there must\r\nhave been a time when the moon or the materials of the moon were in\r\nactual contact with the materials of the earth. In fact, it seems quite\r\npossible that the moon may have been a portion of the earth, broken off\r\nat some very early period, while the earth was still in a liquid state,\r\nif indeed it had condensed to even that extent. Thus the revolution of\r\nthe moon round the earth is hardly to be used as an argument in favour\r\nof the nebular hypothesis. The moon is indeed a consequence of the\r\nearth’s rotation.\r\n\r\nThe satellites of Mars offer conditions of a very different kind, though\r\nhere, again, tidal influences have been so important, that it is perhaps\r\nquestions relating to tides that are illustrated by these satellites\r\nrather than the nebular theory.\r\n\r\nA remarkable circumstance may be noted with regard to the movements of\r\nthe satellites of Mars. The inner satellite has a period of about seven\r\nand a half hours, which is not a third of the period that the planet\r\nitself takes to go round on its axis. This leads to a somewhat curious\r\nconsequence. The tides raised on Mars by this inner satellite would\r\ncertainly tend rather to accelerate the rotation of the planet than to\r\nretard it; for these tides must course round the planet in the direction\r\nof its rotation, but with a speed in excess of that rotation. Any tidal\r\nfriction, so far as this satellite is concerned, will tend to augment\r\nthe velocity of the planet’s rotation, just as in the opposite case,\r\nwhere the moon raises tides on the earth, it is the lagging of the tides\r\nbehind the movement due to the rotation that acts as a brake, and tends\r\nto check that speed. If, therefore. Mars is accelerated by this\r\nsatellite, it will do more than its original share of the moment of\r\nmomentum of the Martian system; it is therefore imperative that the\r\nsatellite shall do less. Accordingly, we find that this satellite must\r\ngo in towards the planet. No doubt this effect is much complicated by\r\nthe influence of the other satellite of the same planet, but the\r\nillustration may suffice to show that if the satellites of the earth and\r\nMars do not convey to us much direct evidence with regard to the nebular\r\ntheory, this is largely because the effect of the tides has been a\r\npreponderating influence. The Martian system as we now see it has\r\nacquired its characteristic features by tidal influence, so that the\r\nmore simple influences which would immediately illustrate the nebular\r\ntheory have become hidden.\r\n\r\nAs to the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, the circumstances are again\r\nquite different from those that we find in the earth and in Mars. There\r\nis little more to be said with regard to them than that everything that\r\nthey present to us is consistent with the indications of the nebular\r\ntheory. The evolution in each case has been a reproduction in miniature\r\nof the evolution of the solar system.\r\n\r\nBut the satellites of Uranus and Neptune present, it must be admitted,\r\nthe greatest stumbling block to the acceptance of the nebular theory.\r\nBoth as to the directions in which they move and as to the planes in\r\nwhich their orbits lie, it must be admitted that the satellites of\r\nUranus are distinctly at variance with what the nebular theory would\r\nsuggest. The consideration of this subject will be found in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                   OBJECTIONS TO THE NEBULAR THEORY.\r\n\r\nThere are Difficulties in the Nebular Theory—The General Conformity of\r\n    the Movements—Details of the Uranian Movements—The Anomaly in the\r\n    Satellite of Neptune—Where the Difficulty Lies—The Fundamental\r\n    Principle which Dynamics Offers for our Guidance—The Immense\r\n    Contrast between the Nebula in its Original Form and its Final\r\n    Form—Energy that could be Obtained by a rearrangement of our\r\n    System—Probable Nature of the Present Change in the Plane of the\r\n    Orbits of the Satellites of Uranus—The Similar Explanation in the\r\n    Case of Neptune.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO one will deny that there are points in connection with the nebular\r\ntheory which present difficulties which to some seem important. We shall\r\nendeavour to estimate the significance of these difficulties in this\r\nchapter. They are certain anomalous phenomena presented by the planets\r\nUranus and Neptune.\r\n\r\nThe satellites which attend upon the planets exhibit a general\r\nconformity with those movements of the planets themselves on which we\r\nhave dwelt in Chapters XIV., XV., XVI. The planes in which the orbits of\r\nthe satellites are contained are usually not much inclined to the plane\r\nof the ecliptic, and the directions in which the satellites revolve also\r\nagree with the general direction of the planetary movement. We find\r\nthese conditions in the one satellite of the earth, in the two\r\nsatellites of Mars, in the five satellites of Jupiter, in the eight or\r\nnine satellites of Saturn; but, when we come to Uranus and Neptune, the\r\ntwo outermost planets, we observe a striking but most instructive\r\nviolation of the laws which we have found so consistently prevailing in\r\nthe other parts of the solar system.\r\n\r\nLet me first mention the special circumstances of Uranus. It is now\r\nknown that this planet has four satellites. Of these, Titania and Oberon\r\nwere both discovered by Sir William Herschel on January 11th, 1787. The\r\ntwo remaining satellites, named Ariel and Umbriel, were not discovered\r\nfor more than half a century later by Mr. Lassell, on October 24th,\r\n1851. It is, however, just possible that they were previously seen by\r\nSir William Herschel.\r\n\r\nThe innermost of the four satellites, Ariel, accomplishes a revolution\r\nin a day and a half, Umbriel goes round in four days and three hours,\r\nTitania in eight days and seventeen hours, and Oberon in thirteen days\r\nand eleven hours. We have already mentioned how the investigations of\r\nNewcomb show that these four satellites of Uranus revolve in the same\r\ndirection and in the same plane; but this plane, instead of lying in or\r\nnear the ecliptic, is very nearly perpendicular thereto, the actual\r\nangle being eighty-three degrees. This is one of the features in which\r\nthe satellites of Uranus are in startling disobedience to the laws which\r\nhave been so rigidly observed in most other parts of the system. But\r\nthere is also a second anomaly. The direction in which the satellites\r\nmove, when projected on the plane of the ecliptic, is found to be\r\nopposite to the universal direction in which all the other movements in\r\nthe solar system are performed. Of course the fact that the plane of the\r\norbits of the satellites lies so nearly at right angles to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic detracts somewhat from the significance of this\r\ncircumstance. If the two planes were absolutely at right angles, there\r\nwould be, of course, no projection at all, and, in the actual\r\ncircumstances, the moment of momentum, when projected, loses\r\nnineteen-twentieths of its amount. It follows that in the actual\r\nposition of the plane the abnormal direction in which the satellites are\r\nmoving is not very material.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, in the position of the plane of their orbits\r\nand the direction of their movements, the satellites of Uranus are in\r\ncontrast to what a hasty consideration of the nebular theory might have\r\nled us to expect. If the orbits of those satellites had all lain close\r\nto the plane of the ecliptic, and if the direction in which the\r\nsatellites revolved had also conspired with that of the revolution of\r\nUranus round the sun, and with all the other hundreds of movements which\r\nare in the same direction, there can be no doubt that we should in this\r\nplace have been appealing to the satellites of Uranus as confirmatory\r\nevidence of the truth of the nebular theory. The fact that they move in\r\na manner so totally at variance with what might have been expected\r\ncannot therefore be overlooked.\r\n\r\nNeptune, the outermost planet of our system, presents us also with\r\ndifficulties of an analogous character. So far as the orbit of Neptune\r\nitself is concerned, it agrees entirely with the general planetary\r\nconvention; the inclination of that orbit to the plane of the ecliptic\r\nis no more than six degrees, and the direction in which the outermost\r\nplanet revolves round the frontier of our system is not different from\r\nthe directions in which all the other planets revolve. We know nothing\r\nabout the axis of rotation of Neptune except that it may be reasonably\r\npresumed to be in the same plane as the movement of its satellite. On\r\nOctober 10th, 1846, Lassell, with the help of his great telescope,\r\nsuspected the existence of a satellite to Neptune, and he announced it\r\ndefinitely on July 7th, 1847. We are indebted to Newcomb for a careful\r\ninvestigation of the orbit of this satellite. It moves in a track which\r\nis practically circular, and it requires about five days and twenty-one\r\nhours to accomplish each revolution. Its inclination to the ecliptic is\r\nnot so anomalous as in the case of Uranus, the inclination being in this\r\ncase not more than thirty-five degrees. This is not much greater than\r\nthe inclinations of the orbits of some of the asteroids, and it might\r\nhave passed without much comment had it not been for the circumstance\r\nthat the direction of motion of the satellite in this track is\r\nantagonistic to all the other movements in the solar system. This is\r\nindeed a more startling fact in some respects than the movements of the\r\nsatellites of Uranus, for, as we pointed out, the plane of the orbits of\r\nthe satellites of Uranus is so nearly perpendicular to the plane of the\r\necliptic that the direction of the movement could not be held to be of\r\nmuch significance. The satellite of Neptune, having an orbital\r\ninclination barely more than a third of a right angle, exhibits a\r\nretrograde movement which is in some respects the most anomalous feature\r\nin the solar system.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances connected with the satellites of Uranus and Neptune\r\nhave been sometimes brought forward as arguments against the nebular\r\ntheory. What Laplace would have said to them we can only conjecture,\r\nfor, at the time he brought out his theory, Neptune was entirely\r\nunknown, and none of the satellites of Uranus had been observed. But it\r\nhas sometimes been urged that the movements of these two systems are\r\ninconsistent with the principles of the nebular theory, and that,\r\ntherefore, the nebular theory must be abandoned. I have no desire to\r\nminimise the difficulties, but I think the considerations to which I now\r\ninvite attention may help to lessen them even if they do not altogether\r\nremove them. I trust, at least, we may be able to show that even those\r\nanomalous movements are not incompatible with the acceptance of the\r\naccount of the origin of our solar system given by the nebular theory.\r\n\r\nThe primæval nebula may be regarded as chaotic in its earliest stages;\r\nperhaps it was like the nebulous wisps in Fig. 51. It was chaotic in the\r\narrangement of the material of which it is formed, and in the movements\r\nof that material. Before a disorganised nebula can become evolved into a\r\nnebula with any definite form like that in Fig. 52, or into anything\r\nresembling a solar system, an immense period of time must elapse, and\r\nduring that time the operation of the laws of dynamics gradually\r\nimpresses certain well-marked features on the nebula, and disposes it to\r\nassume an orderly form. We have explained that no matter how the nebula\r\noriginated, or no matter what may have been the irregularities in its\r\nextent or distribution, and no matter how diverse may have been the\r\nagitations of its various parts, the principles of dynamics assure us\r\nthat each such nebula must, for all time, stand in some special relation\r\nto a certain particular plane. The moment of momentum which the nebula\r\nhas with respect to this plane, exceeds the moment of momentum that it\r\nhas with respect to any other plane. We have pointed out how,\r\nnotwithstanding the vicissitudes and transformations to which, in the\r\ncourse of illimitable ages, the nebula must submit, its moment of\r\nmomentum relatively to this plane will remain absolutely unaltered. We\r\nhave shown how the energy of the nebula becomes gradually exhausted. The\r\ncollisions between various particles, the frictions that will\r\nnecessarily arise, and the actions which we may sufficiently describe by\r\nsaying that they are of a tidal character, will all result in the\r\ntransformation of energy into heat. This heat is radiated away and lost,\r\nand there is a corresponding decline in the energy of the system. To\r\npreserve its moment of momentum unaltered in the course of ages,\r\nnotwithstanding the continuous reduction of energy, the materials of the\r\nnebula will ever find themselves more and more approximating to the\r\nplane, and will ever find themselves more and more compelled to revolve\r\nin the same direction. If the original size of the nebula be compared\r\nwith the area of the Atlantic Ocean, the condensed form which the nebula\r\nmay ultimately assume may be no larger than a coral island. If the nett\r\nmoment of momentum, diffused over the space as large as the ocean, has\r\nstill to be preserved in the space as large as the island, we need not\r\nbe surprised that the spin of the system in its condensed form is its\r\ndominating characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn the evolution of our solar system from the primæval nebula, this\r\noperation of reducing the movements to the same plane and of requiring\r\nthat all the movements shall take place in the same direction, having\r\nhad play for unmeasured ages, has in the main accomplished its end. All\r\nthe important bodies of the system do go round in the same direction;\r\nthat much, at least, has been attained. All of them also go round in\r\nplanes which are nearly coincident, but, as we have already noted, they\r\nare not yet absolutely coincident. The greatest planets have, however,\r\nvery nearly become reconciled, so far as the planes of their orbits are\r\nconcerned, to the condition which dynamics imposes. The same is true of\r\nthe rotation of the sun on its axis. That axis is inclined at an angle\r\nof eighty-three degrees to the plane of the ecliptic, so that the sun’s\r\nequator would have to be shifted only through an angle no greater than\r\nseven degrees, if it were to be placed in the plane in which it should\r\nbe situated, if the condition of the smallest quantity of energy for a\r\ngiven amount of moment of momentum was to be realised. We find a greater\r\ndiscrepancy in the plane of the earth’s equator. This is inclined by\r\nabout twenty-three degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Here there is\r\nsome energy which might yet be expended without a diminution of the\r\namount of moment of momentum in the system; for if the earth’s axis were\r\nto be made perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, then the velocity\r\nof rotation of the earth about its axis might undergo a corresponding\r\nabatement, and yet keep up the requisite moment of momentum. We thus see\r\nthat even with the older planets the conditions which would be enforced,\r\nif the moment of momentum was to be sustained with the least quantity of\r\nenergy, are not absolutely complied with; which simply means that there\r\nhas not yet been time enough for our system to arrive at the perfect\r\nstate, to which it must be approximating.\r\n\r\nIf we have found that in the rotations of the earth and of the sun, and\r\nin the revolutions of the planets round the sun, the conditions\r\nultimately aimed at have not yet been reached, why should we feel\r\nsurprised that in the outer planets of our system, Uranus and Neptune,\r\nthe conditions which evolution tends to produce have not yet been fully\r\nattained? That the operation of the conservation of moment of momentum\r\nis in progress in the internal economy of the Uranian system, we have\r\nalready had occasion to explain in Chapter XI. The fact which Newcomb\r\ndemonstrated, that the four satellites revolve in the same plane, can\r\nonly be accounted for by the supposition that in that system the\r\nconservation of moment of momentum, with declining energy, has gradually\r\nimposed this condition on the system belonging to Uranus. With reference\r\nto the position of the plane of the satellites, in the case of Uranus\r\nand Neptune, we would say, that though at present their arrangement\r\nappears anomalous, it will probably not always remain so. The fact that\r\nthe satellites of Uranus are in a plane nearly perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the ecliptic really implies that there is a certain amount of\r\nenergy still disposable in our system, if by readjustment of the plane\r\nof the Uranian satellites the necessary moment of momentum in the system\r\nis still preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.—TWO-BRANCHED SPIRAL (n.g.c. 7479; in Pegasus).\r\n(_Lick Observatory._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe laws of dynamics tell us that the orbits of planets must be\r\ngradually, if with excessive slowness, tending still further to the same\r\nplane. In this process energy can be expended by the system, while the\r\nmoment of momentum is unabated. We can at least suggest what seems to be\r\nat this moment in progress in the system belonging to Uranus. It will\r\nreadily be admitted that there may be a difficulty in seeing how the\r\nmovement of a planet, which is going in the wrong direction, could be\r\nstopped and turned into the right direction. But we need not suppose\r\nthat so violent a change as this would imply is to be expected in our\r\nsystem. We are quite accustomed to find the planes of the orbits of all\r\nplanets in gradual movement. The plane containing the orbits of the four\r\nsatellites of Uranus is at this moment probably moving gradually\r\nupwards. It will in due course become actually at right angles to the\r\necliptic, and we may then reasonably assume that it will advance further\r\nin the same direction. At the moment the right angle is passed, this\r\ncontinuous movement will have the effect of changing the directions of\r\nthe satellites’ movement from retrograde to direct. The present anomaly\r\nwill then tend to become evanescent, for, as the exhaustion of the\r\nenergy continues, the planes of the satellites of Uranus will gradually\r\ncome into conformity with the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nWe make no doubt that there may be a similar explanation of the\r\nmovements of the satellite of Neptune. The inclination of the plane of\r\nthe orbit of the satellite to the ecliptic is probably now increasing.\r\nIt will ultimately come to be at right angles thereto, and then the next\r\nadvance of the plane will convert, by a continuous action, the\r\nretrograde motion of the satellite, at present so disconcerting, into a\r\ndirect motion. The change of the plane will still continue until it,\r\ntoo, may ultimately coalesce with the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe fact appears to be, that though an enormous quantity of energy must\r\nhave been lost by radiation from our system during the illimitable ages\r\nthrough which the evolution has been running its course, the disposable\r\nenergy is not yet quite exhausted. There are certain adjustments in our\r\nsystem which may still be made and which will allow of yet further\r\nradiation of energy, while still preserving sufficient to keep up the\r\nnecessary moment of momentum. It seems obvious that the system is\r\ntending towards a condition in which the planes of all the orbits shall\r\nbe coincident, and in which all the directions shall be absolutely\r\nunanimous. If we were at once to alter the system by moving all the\r\norbits into the plane of the ecliptic, but making no change in the\r\ndimensions of those orbits, or the velocities concerned; if we were also\r\nto adjust the rotations of the earth, as well as of the other planets,\r\nso that all the axes of rotation should be perpendicular to the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic; if we were to turn the plane of the satellites of Uranus\r\nthrough that angle of 97°, which would suffice at the same time to bring\r\nit into coincidence with the ecliptic, and lay the movements of the\r\nsatellites in the right direction; if we were also to turn the orbit of\r\nthe satellite of Neptune through 145°, thus bringing that orbit to\r\ncoincide with the plane of the ecliptic, in such a manner that the\r\ndirection of the movement of the satellite of Neptune conspired with all\r\nthe other movements of the system, then this rearrangement of the system\r\nwould increase the moment of momentum, while the quantity of energy was\r\nnot altered. But this is the same thing as saying that some energy yet\r\nremains to be disposed of, while the system still preserves the\r\nrequisite moment of momentum.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion we come to may be thus expressed: the movements of the\r\nsatellites of Uranus and Neptune do not disprove the nebular hypothesis.\r\nThey rather illustrate the fact that the great evolution which has\r\nwrought the solar system into form has not yet finished its work; it is\r\nstill in progress. The work is very nearly done, and when that work\r\nshall have been completed, the satellites of Uranus and Neptune will no\r\nlonger be dissociated from the general concord.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                      THE BEGINNING OF THE NEBULA.\r\n\r\nNebula not of Infinite Duration—8,300 Coal-Units was the Total Energy\r\n    of the System—460 Miles a Second—Solar Nebula from a\r\n    Collision—What we Know as to the Colliding Bodies—Probability of\r\n    Celestial Collisions—Multitudes of Dark Objects—New Star in\r\n    Perseus—Characteristics of New Stars—Incandescent Hydrogen—The\r\n    Ruby in the Spectrum—Photographs of the Spectrum—Rarity of a\r\n    Collision on a Scale Adequate to a Solar System.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHATEVER may have been the antiquity of the actual elements that formed\r\nthe primæval nebula from which the solar system has been evolved, the\r\nnebula itself has certainly not been of infinite duration. The question\r\nthen arises as to what has been the origin of the nebula as such, or\r\nrather by what agency the material from which the nebula was formed\r\nunderwent so radical a transformation from its previous condition as to\r\nbe changed into that glowing object which we have considered so\r\nfrequently in this book. We have to explain how, by the operation of\r\nnatural causes, a dark body can be transformed into a glowing nebula.\r\n\r\nLet us first estimate what the quantity of energy in that system is. The\r\nsun has been pouring forth heat for inimitable ages, and will doubtless\r\ncontinue to pour forth heat for millions of years to come. But the\r\ndestiny which awaits the sun, though it may be protracted, yet cannot be\r\naverted. The sun will go on pouring forth its heat and gradually\r\nshrinking. The time will come at last when the radius of the sun will\r\nhave appreciably decreased, and when once it has assumed a density\r\ncorresponding to a solid state its history as a radiant globe will be\r\napproaching its close. A period of insignificant extent, a century or\r\nless, will then suffice for that solid globe to cool down so as to be no\r\nlonger an efficient source of light and heat. We shall assume that when\r\nthe sun has ultimately become solid and cold, and when it is no longer\r\nthe life and light of our system, it will have attained a mean density\r\nof 21.5, which we have chosen because that is the density of platinum,\r\nthe heaviest substance known. In all probability the solar density will\r\nnever become so great as this, but to include the most extreme case in\r\nour argument I am making the assumption in the form stated. We are now\r\nto estimate what will have been the total energy that the sun has\r\nradiated from the moment when as an indefinitely great nebula it first\r\nbegan to radiate at all, down to that moment in the future when, having\r\nshrunk to the density of platinum, and having parted with all its heat,\r\nthe solar radiation is at an end.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the evolutionary history the sun was a nebula, which\r\nwe have supposed to extend in every direction to an indefinitely great\r\ndistance. The system has resulted from the contraction of that nebula,\r\nand the energy liberated in that contraction has supplied the sun’s\r\nradiation. We calculate (_see_ Appendix) the energy that would be given\r\nout in the contraction of a nebula whose materials were originally at\r\ninfinity, and which ultimately coalesced to form a cold, solid globe of\r\nthe density of platinum, and as heavy as the sun. There is no object in\r\nattempting to express this quantity of energy in foot-pounds—the figures\r\nwould convey no distinct impression—we shall employ the coal-unit\r\nexplained in Chapter VI. We imagine a globe of coal the weight of the\r\nsun; then, if that globe of coal were adequately supplied with oxygen,\r\nit would, on combustion, give out a certain amount of heat, which is a\r\nconvenient unit for our measurements. It is demonstrated that the\r\nquantity of energy given out by the contraction of the nebula from\r\ninfinity, to this globe of the density of platinum, would be about equal\r\nto the quantity of energy which would be produced by the combustion of\r\n8,300 globes of coal as heavy as the sun, an adequate contribution of\r\noxygen being supposed to be supplied. This expresses the original\r\nendowment of energy in the solar system, or rather a major limit to that\r\nendowment; it shows that the solar system can never have developed more\r\nenergy by contraction than that which could be produced by the\r\ncombustion of 8,300 globes of coal as heavy as the sun. We may mention\r\nthat of this great endowment of energy an amount which is rather less\r\nthan half (3,400) has been already expended, so that rather more than\r\nhalf of the sun’s career as a radiant globe may yet have to be run.\r\n\r\nWe can also express the total energy of the solar system in a different\r\nmanner. We shall consider what must be the velocity of the sun, so that\r\nthe energy that it will possess, in virtue of that velocity, shall be\r\nequal to the energy which could be produced by the combustion of 8,300\r\nglobes of coal of the same weight. This calculation is very much\r\nsimplified by making use of a principle which we have already stated and\r\napplied in Chapter V. We have shown that if a piece of coal be animated\r\nwith a velocity of five miles a second, the energy it possesses in\r\nvirtue of that motion is equal to the energy produced by the coal in the\r\nact of combustion. If a body were moving at the rate of, let us say, 100\r\nmiles a second—its speed being then twenty times as great as the\r\nparticular speed just mentioned—its energy, which depends on the square\r\nof the velocity, would be 400 times as much as would be produced by the\r\nburning of a piece of coal equal to it in weight. We can easily\r\ncalculate that if the sun were moving at a speed of 460 miles a second,\r\nit would possess, in virtue of its motion, as much energy as would be\r\ngenerated by the contraction of the primæval nebula from infinity down\r\nto a globe of the density of platinum.\r\n\r\nIt is thus easy to form a supposition as to how the nebula constituting\r\nour solar system may have come into being; most probably it originated\r\nin this way. Let us suppose that two masses, either dark or bright,\r\neither hot or of the temperature of space, or the temperature of frozen\r\nair, were moving with speeds of 460 miles a second. No doubt the\r\nvelocities we are here postulating are very high velocities, but they\r\nare not unprecedentedly high. We know of stars which at this present\r\nmoment move quite as fast, so that there is nothing unreasonable in our\r\nsupposition so far as the velocities are concerned. Let us suppose that\r\neach of these bodies had a mass which is half that of our present solar\r\nsystem. If these two bodies dashed into collision, when moving from\r\nopposite directions, the effect of the blow would be to transform the\r\nenergy into heat. That heat would be so great that it would be\r\nsufficient not alone to render these globes red-hot and white-hot, but\r\neven to fuse them—nay, further, to drive them into vapour, even to a\r\nvapour which might expand to an enormously great distance. In other\r\nwords, it is quite conceivable that a collision of two such masses as we\r\nhave here supposed might be adequate to the formation of a nebula such\r\nas that one which in the lapse of indefinite ages has shaped itself into\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nBefore the collision, which resulted in the formation of the nebula,\r\neach of these bodies, or rather their centres of gravity, would be\r\nmoving in what may be regarded for the moment as straight lines, and a\r\nplane through those two straight lines will be a plane which for ever\r\nafterwards will stand in important relation to the system. It will be,\r\nin fact, that principal plane of which we have so often spoken.\r\n\r\nAs those two bodies met they would possess a certain moment of momentum,\r\nand this moment of momentum would remain for ever unaltered, no matter\r\nwhat may be the future vicissitudes of the system.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity in describing what has occurred, we have\r\nspoken as if the two bodies were of equal mass, and, moving with equal\r\nvelocities from opposite points of the heavens, dashed into collision.\r\nBut what actually happens cannot have been quite so symmetrical. There\r\nis one feature in the solar system which absolutely proves that the\r\ncollision cannot have taken place precisely in the way we have laid\r\ndown. If it had happened that two equal masses had been hurled into\r\ncollision with equal velocities from precisely opposite directions, then\r\nthere could have been no resultant moment of momentum. From the\r\nprinciple of the conservation of moment of momentum, we can see that, if\r\nabsent in the beginning, it could never originate later. As, however, we\r\nhave a large moment of momentum in the movements of the planets and the\r\nsun, it is certain that the collision cannot have taken place in a\r\nmanner quite so simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.—CLUSTER WITH STARS OF 17TH MAGNITUDE\r\n(n.g.c. 6705; in Antinous).\r\n(_Photographed by Dr. Isaac Roberts, F.R.S._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe probabilities of the case show that it is almost infinitely unlikely\r\nthat two bodies of equal dimensions, and moving with equal velocities in\r\nopposite directions, should come squarely into collision. It would be\r\nmuch more likely that the bodies should be not of the same size, not\r\nmoving with the same velocity, and should collide partially rather than\r\nsquarely. The collision may have been, in fact, little more than a\r\ngraze. The probabilities of the case are such as to show that what\r\nactually occurred was a collision between two unequal masses, which were\r\nmoving in directions inclined to each other and with different\r\nvelocities. It is easy to show that, granted sufficiently great\r\nvelocities, an impact which fell far short of direct collision might\r\nstill produce enough heat to transform the whole solar system into\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which would naturally accompany so transcendent an\r\nincident will also go far to account for a difficulty which has been\r\noften felt with regard to the evolution of the system from a nebula.\r\nWere such a collision to take place we should certainly not expect that\r\nthe resulting nebulous mass, the product of a shock of such stupendous\r\nviolence, would be a homogeneous or symmetrical object. Portions of the\r\ncolliding body would become more highly heated than others; portions of\r\nthe bodies would not be so completely transformed into vapour as would\r\nother parts. There would thus be differences in the nebula at the\r\ndifferent parts of its mass. This non-homogeneity would be connected\r\nwith the formation and growth of planets in the different parts of the\r\nnebula.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance connected with the movement of the sun\r\nwhich should here be mentioned. It is well known that the sun has a\r\nvelocity which carries it on through space at the rate of half a million\r\nmiles a day. In this movement the whole solar system, of course,\r\nparticipates. This movement of translation of our system must also be a\r\nresult of the movements of the two original colliding masses. These two\r\nmasses imparted to the system, which resulted from their union, both the\r\nlineal velocity with which it advances through space, and also that\r\nmoment of momentum which is of such vast importance in the theory.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the probabilities of the case make it quite certain\r\nthat the celestial bodies we see are as nothing compared with the dark\r\nbodies we do not see. The stars we see are moving, and the natural\r\nassumption is that the dark objects with which the heavens teem are also\r\nin motion. We shall, under these conditions, not feel any insuperable\r\ndifficulty in the supposition that collisions between different bodies\r\nin the heavens may have taken place from time to time. We remember that\r\nthese bodies are moving in all directions, and at extremely high\r\nvelocities. We are quite willing to grant the excessive improbability\r\nthat any two bodies particularly specified should come into collision.\r\nWithin view of our telescopes we have, however, a hundred millions of\r\nstars, and if we multiply that figure even by millions, it will still,\r\nwe may well suppose, not be too large to express the number of bodies\r\nwhich, though contained within the region of space ranged over by our\r\ntelescopes, are still totally invisible. In these circumstances, we may\r\nadmit that occasional collisions are not impossible. Please note the\r\nstrength which the argument derives from the enormous increase in our\r\nestimate of the number of bodies, when we include the dark objects as\r\nwell as the stars. If we were asked whether it would ever be possible\r\nfor two bright stars to come into collision, we might well hesitate\r\nabout the answer. We know, of course, that the stars have proper\r\nmotions; we know, too, that the stars, in this respect unlike the\r\nplanets, have no definite directions of movement under the control of a\r\nsupreme co-ordinating attraction. Some stars move to the right, and some\r\nto the left, some one way and some another; but even still,\r\nnotwithstanding their great number, the extent of space is such that the\r\nstars keep widely apart, and thus collisions can hardly be expected to\r\ntake place, unless perhaps in a cluster such as that shown in Fig. 53.\r\nWe have no reason to think that a collision between two actual bright\r\nstars was the origin of the primæval nebula of our system. But when we\r\nreflect that the stars, properly so called, are but the visible members\r\nof an enormously greater host of objects, then the possibilities of\r\noccasional collision between a pair of these incomparably more abundant\r\ndark bodies seems to merit our close attention. We are not by any means\r\nclaiming that such collisions occur frequently. But what we do say is,\r\nthat if, as we believe, these bodies are to be reckoned in many millions\r\nof millions, then it does sometimes happen that two of them, moving\r\nabout in space, will approach together sufficiently to give rise to a\r\ncollision. It was from some such collision that we believe the nebula\r\ntook its rise from which the solar system originated.\r\n\r\nWe have the best reason for knowing that celestial collisions do\r\nsometimes occur. It will be in the recollection of the readers of this\r\nchapter that in February, 1901, the astronomical world was startled by\r\nthe announcement of the outbreak of a new star in Perseus. A photograph\r\nof that part of the heavens had been taken a few days before. There were\r\nthe ordinary stars, such as existed from time immemorial, and such as\r\nhave been represented on the numerous maps in which the stars are\r\nfaithfully set down. But, on February 22nd, Dr. Anderson, already famous\r\nby similar discoveries, noticed that the constellation of Perseus\r\ncontained a star which he had not seen before. Instantly the\r\nastronomical world was apprised by telegraph that a new star had\r\nappeared in Perseus, and forthwith most diligent attention was paid to\r\nits observation. Photographs then obtained show the stars that had been\r\nseen there before, with the addition of the new star that had suddenly\r\ncome into view. For a few nights after its discovery the object\r\nincreased in lustre, until it attained a brightness as great as that of\r\nCapella or Vega. But in this state it did not long remain. This\r\nbrilliant object began to wane. Presently it could not be classed as a\r\nstar of the first magnitude, nor yet of the second, and then it ran down\r\nuntil a little below the third, and even below the fourth. In the\r\nsubsequent decline of the star there were several curious oscillations.\r\nOn one night the star might be seen, the next night it would be hardly\r\ndiscerned, while the night after it had again risen considerably. But,\r\nnotwithstanding such temporary rallies, the brightness, on the whole,\r\ndeclined, until at last the star dwindled to the dimensions of a small\r\npoint of light, scarcely distinguishable with the naked eye. The decline\r\nwas apparently not so rapid as the increase, but nevertheless from the\r\nfirst moment of its appearance to the last was not longer than a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThis new star in Perseus established, in one sense, a record. For the\r\nstar was brighter than any new star which had been noticed since the\r\ndays of accurate astronomical observations. Not indeed for three\r\ncenturies had a star of such lustre sprung into existence. But a\r\ntemporary star, such as this was, has been by no means an infrequent\r\noccurrence. Many such have been recorded. Those who have been acquainted\r\nwith astronomical matters for thirty years will recollect four or five\r\nsuch stars. In each of them the general character was somewhat the same.\r\nThere was a sudden outbreak, and then a gradual decline. The questions\r\nhave sometimes arisen as to whether the outbreak of such an object is\r\nreally the temporary exaltation of a star which was previously visible,\r\nor whether it ought not to be regarded as the creation of a totally new\r\nstar. In some cases it does seem possible that a new star may have been\r\npartly, at all events, due to a large increase of brightness of some\r\nstar which had been known before. In the case of Nova Persei, however,\r\nwe have the best authority that this is not the case. Professor\r\nPickering, the distinguished astronomer of Harvard College Observatory,\r\nhappened to photograph the region in which Nova Persei appeared a few\r\ndays before the outbreak took place. He tells us that there is not the\r\nleast indication on his photograph of the presence of a star in that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.—SPECTRUM OF NOVA PERSEI (1901).\r\n(_Photographed with the 40 in. Yerkes Telescope by Mr. Ferdinand\r\nEllerman._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Nova Persei, in an instrument of sufficient power,\r\nappeared a truly magnificent object. Like other stellar spectra, it\r\ndisplayed the long line of light marked with the hues of the rainbow,\r\nbut it was unlike the spectra of ordinary stars in respect of the\r\nenormous enhancements of the brightness at various parts of this\r\nspectrum. For instance, at one end of the long coloured band a brilliant\r\nruby line glowed with a lustre that would at once attract attention, and\r\ndemonstrated that the object under view must be something totally\r\ndifferent from ordinary stars. This superb feature is one of the lines\r\nof hydrogen. The presence of that line showed that m the source from\r\nwhich the light came there must have been a remarkable outbreak of\r\nincandescent hydrogen gas. At various points along the spectrum there\r\nwere other beautiful bright lines which, in each case, must have been\r\ndue to glowing gas. Here we have the evidence of the spectrum telling us\r\nin unmistakable language that there were features in this star wholly\r\nunlike the features found in any ordinary star. It is impossible to\r\ndissociate these facts from the history of the star. Much of what we\r\nhave said with regard to the spectrum of Nova Persei might be repeated\r\nwith regard to the spectrum of the other temporary stars which, from\r\ntime to time, have burst forth. In each case the spectrum characteristic\r\nof an ordinary star is present, but superadded to it are bright lines\r\nwhich indicate that some great convulsion has taken place, a convulsion\r\nby which vast volumes of gas have been rendered incandescent. In Fig. 54\r\nwe show the spectrum of Nova Persei on five dates, from February 27th to\r\nMarch 28th, 1901. These photographs were taken by Mr. Ferdinand Ellerman\r\nwith the great telescope of the Yerkes Observatory. They show in the\r\nclearest manner the bright lines indicating the incandescent gases.\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out the high probability that among the millions and\r\nmillions of bodies in the universe it may now and then happen that a\r\ncollision takes place. Have we not also explained how the heat generated\r\nin virtue of such a collision might be sufficient, and, indeed, much\r\nmore than sufficient, to raise the masses of the two colliding bodies to\r\na state of vivid incandescence? A collision affords the simplest\r\nexplanation of the sudden outbreak of the star, and also accounts for\r\nthe remarkable spectrum which the star exhibits.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                          CONCLUDING CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nComprehensiveness of the Nebular Theory—Illustration—Huxley and the\r\n    Origin of Species—Rudimentary Organs—The Apteryx—Its Evanescent\r\n    Wings—The Skeleton—An Historical Explanation—Application of the Same\r\n    Method to the Nebular Theory—The Internal Heat of the Earth—The Lady\r\n    Psyche.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is not difficult to show that the nebular theory occupies a unique\r\nposition among other speculations of the human intellect. It is so\r\ncomprehensive that almost every conceivable topic will bear some\r\nrelation to it. Perhaps I may venture to give a rather curious\r\nillustration of this fact, which was told me many years ago by one who\r\nattended a course of lectures by an eminent Professor in the medical\r\nfaculty at, let us say, Vienna. The subject of the course was the no\r\ndoubt highly important, but possibly not generally interesting, subject\r\nof “inflammation.” I think I am right in saying that the course had to\r\nlast for six months, because the subject was to be treated with\r\ncharacteristic breadth and profundity. At all events, I distinctly\r\nremember that the learned Professor commenced his long series of\r\nprofessional discourses with an account of the nebular theory, and from\r\nthat starting point he gradually evolved the sequence of events which\r\nultimately culminated in—inflammation!\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that in the year 1880, Professor Huxley delivered\r\nat the Royal Institution a famous lecture which he termed “The Coming of\r\nAge of the Origin of Species.” Among the many remarkable and forcible\r\nillustrations which this lecture contained, I recall one which brought\r\nbefore the audience, in the most convincing manner, the truth of the\r\ngreat Darwinian Theory of Evolution. Huxley pointed out how the\r\ndiscoveries in Biology, during the twenty-one years which immediately\r\nsucceeded the publication of the “Origin of Species,” had been so\r\nnumerous and so important, and had a bearing so remarkable on the great\r\nevolutionary theory, that even if the Darwinian Theory had not been\r\nformed to explain the facts of Nature, as they were known at the time\r\nwhen Darwin published his immortal book, the same theory would have had\r\nto be formed, were it only to explain the additional facts which had\r\ncome to light since the great theory itself had been first given to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI believe we may use similar language with regard to the nebular theory\r\nand its great founders, Kant, Laplace, and Herschel. If the facts which\r\nwere known to these philosophers led them to adopt in one form or\r\nanother that view of the Origin of the Universe which the nebular theory\r\nsuggests, how stands the theory now in the light of the additional facts\r\nthat have been since disclosed? If we merely took the discoveries which\r\nhave been made since the last of the three great philosophers passed\r\naway, it might well be maintained that a nebular theory would be\r\ndemanded to account for the facts brought to light, in the interval.\r\n\r\nThe argument on which the nebular theory of the solar system is founded\r\nhas other parallels with that wonderful doctrine of Natural Selection by\r\nwhich Darwin revealed the history of life on our globe. It not\r\nunfrequently happens that an animal has in its organisation some\r\nrudiments of a structure which is obviously of no use to the animal in\r\nhis present mode of life, and would be unintelligible if we supposed the\r\nanimal to have been created as he is. A curious instance of a\r\nrudimentary structure is furnished in the apteryx, the famous wingless\r\nbird which still lives in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of civilisation in New Zealand seems likely to be\r\naccompanied with fatal results, so far as the unfortunate apteryx is\r\nconcerned. Weasels and other fierce enemies have been introduced, with\r\nwhich this quaint bird of antiquity is unable to cope. The apteryx is\r\ndefenceless against such foes. Nature had not endowed it with weapons\r\nwherewith to fight, for it had, apparently, no serious adversaries until\r\nthese importations appeared in its island home. Unlike the ostrich, the\r\napteryx has neither strength to fight his enemies, nor speed to run away\r\nfrom them, though, like the ostrich, it has no wings for flight; indeed,\r\nthe apteryx has no wings at all. As its name signifies the apteryx is\r\nthe wingless bird. Living specimens are still to be seen in the\r\nZoological Gardens. The special point to notice is that, though he has\r\nno wings whatever, still there are small rudimentary wing-bones which\r\ncan be easily seen. You need not be afraid to put your hand on the\r\napteryx, and feel the puny little remnants of wings (Fig. 55).\r\n\r\nIf, having seen the bird in the Zoological Gardens, you go to the\r\nNatural History Museum, you will there find a skeleton of the apteryx\r\n(Fig. 56). Look near the ribs in the photograph, and there you will see\r\nthose poor little wing-bones—wing-bones where there never was a wing.\r\nFrom our present point of view these wings are, however, more\r\ninteresting and instructive than the most perfect wings of an eagle or a\r\ncarrier-pigeon. Those wings in the apteryx may be incapable of flight,\r\nbut they are full of instruction to the lover of Nature. As it is\r\ncertain that they are absolutely of no use whatever to the bird, we may\r\nwell ask, why are they there? They are not there to give assistance to\r\nthe bird in his struggle for life; they cannot help him to escape from\r\nhis enemies or to procure his food; they cannot help him to tend and\r\nnurture the young one which is hatched from the egg; they can help him\r\nin no way. The explanation of those ineffectual wings is historical.\r\nThose bones are present in the apteryx simply because that bird has come\r\ndown by a long line of descent from birds which were endowed with\r\ngenuine wings, with wings which enabled them to fly like rooks or\r\npartridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.—THE APTERYX: A WINGLESS BIRD OF NEW ZEALAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.—SKELETON OF THE APTERYX, SHOWING RUDIMENTARY\r\nWINGS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if this be the explanation, how has it come to pass that the wings\r\nhave dwindled to useless little bones? We cannot of course feel certain\r\nof the reason, but it seems possible to make surmises. In early times\r\nwinged birds flew over the sea into New Zealand, and found it a country\r\nof abundance, as many other immigrants have done in later times. It may\r\nhave been that the food in New Zealand was so plentiful that the wants\r\nof the birds could be readily supplied, without the necessity for\r\nranging over large tracts. It may have been that the newly arrived birds\r\nfound that they had few or no enemies in New Zealand, from which flight\r\nwould be necessary as a means of escape. It may possibly have been both\r\ncauses together, and doubtless there must have been other causes as\r\nwell. The fact is, however, certain, that in the course of long\r\ngenerations this bird gradually lost the power of flight. Natural\r\nselection decrees that an organ which has ceased to serve a useful\r\npurpose shall deteriorate in the course of generations. If the wings had\r\nbecome needless in the search for food, unnecessary for escape from\r\nenemies, and useless for protection of its young, they would certainly\r\ntend towards disappearance. The organism finds it uneconomical to\r\nmaintain the nutrition of a structure which discharges no useful end.\r\nThe wings, in such circumstances, would be an encumbrance rather than an\r\naid, and so we may readily conjecture that, in accordance with this\r\nwell-known principle, the wings gradually declined, until they ceased to\r\nbe useful organs, so that now merely a few rudimentary bones remain to\r\nshow that the bird’s ancestors had once been as other birds. Whatever\r\nmay have been the cause, it seems certain that in the course of\r\nthousands of years, or it may be in scores of thousands of years, these\r\nbirds lost the power of flight; thus they gradually ceased to have\r\nwings, and these little bones are all that now remain to render it\r\nalmost certain that, if we could learn what this bird’s ancestry has\r\nbeen, we should find that it was descended from a bird which had useful\r\nwings and vigorous flight. Whenever we find an organ which is obviously\r\nrudimentary, or of no use to its possessor in its present form, Darwin\r\nhas taught us to look for an historical explanation. Let us see if we\r\ncannot apply this principle to the illustration of the nebular theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRALS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF NATURE.\r\nFig. 57.—FORAMINIFER.\r\nFig. 58.—NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe liken the internal heat of the earth to the rudimentary wing-bones of\r\nthe apteryx. In each case we find a survival devoid of much\r\nsignificance, unless in regard to its historical interpretation. But\r\nthat historical significance can hardly be over-estimated. Unimportant\r\nas the wing-bones may be, they admit of explanation only on the\r\nsupposition that the apteryx was descended from a winged ancestor.\r\nUnimportant as the internal heat, still lingering in our globe, may\r\nseem, it admits of explanation only on the supposition that the earth\r\nhas had the origin which the nebular theory suggests.\r\n\r\nThat the earth’s beginning has been substantially in accordance with the\r\ngreat Nebular Theory is, I believe, now very generally admitted. But the\r\nonly authority I shall cite in illustration of this final statement is\r\nthe Lady Psyche, who commences her exquisite address to her “patient\r\nrange of pupils” with the words:—\r\n\r\n                 “This world was once a fluid haze of light,\r\n             Till toward the centre set the starry tides,\r\n             And eddied into suns, that wheeling, cast\r\n             The planets;”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDICES.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n\r\n       I.—ON THE HEAT GIVEN OUT IN THE CONTRACTION OF THE NEBULA.\r\n\r\n      § 1. FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS IN THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION.\r\n\r\nThe first theorem to be proved is as follows:—\r\n\r\n_The attraction of a thin homogeneous spherical shell on any point in\r\nits interior vanishes._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTake any point P within the sphere. Let this be the vertex of a cone\r\nproduced both ways, but with a very small vertical angle, so that the\r\nsmall areas S and S´, in which the two parts of the cone cut the sphere,\r\nmay be regarded as planes. Draw the tangent planes at S and S´. Let the\r\nplane of the paper pass through P and be perpendicular to both these\r\ntangent planes. Let O P O´ be one of the generators of the cone, and let\r\nfall P Q perpendicular to the tangent plane at O, and P Q´ perpendicular\r\nto the tangent plane at O´. The volume of the cone with the vertex at P\r\nand the base S is ⅓ P Q × S, and the other part of the cone has the\r\nvolume ⅓ P Q´ × S´.\r\n\r\nAs the vertical angles of the cones are small, their volumes will, in\r\nthe limit, be in the ratio of O P^3 to O´ P^3, and accordingly ⅓ P Q · S\r\n÷ ⅓ P Q´ · S´ = P O^3 ÷ O´ P^3. But from the figure P Q ÷ P Q´ = P O ÷ P\r\nO´, and hence S ÷ O P^2 = S´ ÷ O´ P^2.\r\n\r\nAs the shell is uniform, the masses of the parts cut out by the cones\r\nare respectively proportional to S and S´. Hence we see that the\r\nattractions of S and S´ on P will neutralise. The same must be true for\r\nevery such cone through P, and accordingly the total attraction of the\r\nshell on a particle inside is zero.\r\n\r\nThe second fundamental theorem is as follows:—\r\n\r\n_A thin spherical homogeneous shell produces the same attraction at an\r\nexternal point as if its entire mass were concentrated at the centre of\r\nthe sphere._\r\n\r\nThis is another famous theorem due to Newton. He gives a beautiful\r\ngeometrical proof in Section XII. of the first book of the “Principia.”\r\nWe shall here take it for granted, and we shall consequently assume\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n_The attraction by the law of gravitation of a homogeneous sphere on an\r\nexternal point is the same as if the entire mass of the sphere were\r\nconcentrated at its centre._\r\n\r\n\r\n           § 2. ON THE ENERGY BETWEEN TWO ATTRACTING MASSES.\r\n\r\nLet _m_ and _m´_ be two attracting bodies supposed to be small in\r\ncomparison with their distance _x_. Let the force between them be ε _m\r\nm´_ ÷ _x_^2 when ε is the force between two unit masses at unit\r\ndistance. It is required to find the energy necessary to separate them\r\nto infinity, it being supposed that they start from an initial distance\r\n_a_. The energy required is obtained by integrating between the limits\r\ninfinity and _a_, and is consequently ε _m_ _m´_ ÷ _a_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     § 3. ON THE ENERGY GIVEN OUT IN THE CONTRACTION OF THE NEBULA.\r\n\r\nWe assume that the nebula is contracting symmetrically, so that at any\r\nmoment it is a homogeneous sphere. We shall consider the shell which\r\nlies between the two spheres of radii, _r_ + _dr_ and _r_ respectively.\r\n\r\nLet M´ be the mass of the nebula contained within the sphere of radius\r\n_r_, and let _d_M´ be the mass of the shell just defined. Then it\r\nfollows from § 1 that the condensation of the shell will have been\r\neffected by the attraction of the mass M´ solely. The exterior parts of\r\nthe nebula can have had no effect, for the outer part has always been in\r\nsymmetrical spherical shells exterior to _d_M´, and the attraction of\r\nthese is zero. We see from § 2 that the contraction of _d_M´ from\r\ninfinity, until it forms a shell with radius _r_, represents a quantity\r\nof energy,\r\n\r\n                           (ε M´_d_M´)/_r_ ;\r\n\r\nfor it is obvious that the energy involved in the contraction of the\r\nwhole shell is the sum of the energies corresponding to its several\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nIf M be the total mass and _a_ the radius of the nebula always supposed\r\nhomogeneous\r\n\r\n                         M´ = M (_r_^3/_a_^3),\r\n\r\nand therefore\r\n\r\n                    _d_M´ = 3 M (_r_^2/_a_^3) _dr_.\r\n\r\nHence the work done in the contraction is\r\n\r\n (ε/_r_) M (_r_^3/_a_^3) · 3 M (_r_^2/_a_^3) _dr_ = (3 ε/_a_^6) M^2 _r_^4\r\n                                  _dr_.\r\n\r\nIntegrating, therefore, the total work of contraction is\r\n\r\n                             ⅗ (ε M^2/_a_)\r\n\r\nAt the present moment a mass of 1 lb. at the surface of the sun would\r\nweigh 27 lbs. if tested by a spring balance. Hence\r\n\r\n                            ε M/_a_^2 = 27.\r\n\r\nWith this substitution we find the expression for the foot-pounds of\r\nwork corresponding to the contraction of the nebula from infinity to a\r\nsphere of radius _a_ to be,\r\n\r\n                  ⅗ · 27 _a_ M = 16 _a_ M very nearly.\r\n\r\nHence we have the following fundamental theorem due to Helmholtz, which\r\nis the basis of the theory of sun heat.\r\n\r\n_If the sun he regarded as a homogeneous sphere of mass_ M _pounds and\r\nradius a feet, then the foot-pounds of energy rendered available for sun\r\nheat by the contraction of the solar material from, an infinite distance\r\nis_ 16 a M.\r\n\r\n\r\n       § 4. EVALUATION OF THE SUN HEAT GIVEN OUT IN CONTRACTION.\r\n\r\nThe number of foot-pounds of work given out in the contraction from\r\ninfinity is 16 _a_ M. As 772 foot-pounds are equal to one unit of heat,\r\n_i.e._ to the quantity of heat necessary to raise 1 lb. of water 1°\r\nFahrenheit, we see that 772 M is the work required to raise a mass of\r\nwater equal to the mass of the sun through 1° Fahrenheit. Hence the\r\nnumber of globes of water, each equal to the sun in mass, which would be\r\nraised 1° Fahrenheit by the total heat arising from the contraction, is\r\n\r\n                             (16 _a_)/772,\r\n\r\nbut _a_, the radius of the sun in feet, is 2,280,000,000, and hence we\r\nhave the following theorem:—\r\n\r\n_The energy liberated in the contraction of the sun from infinity to its\r\npresent dimensions would, if turned into heat, suffice to raise\r\n47,000,000 globes of water, each having the same mass as the sun,\r\nthrough 1° Fahr._\r\n\r\nIt is found by experiment that 1 lb. of good coal may develop 14,000\r\nunits of heat, and is therefore equivalent to 14,000 × 772 foot-pounds\r\nof work. A mass of coal equal to the sun would therefore (granted oxygen\r\nenough) be equivalent to 14,000 × 772 × M foot-pounds of work. But we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n                 (16 _a_ M)             16 × 2,280,000,000\r\n             ––––––––––––––   =  –––––––––––––––  = 3,400.\r\n             14,000 × 772 × M       14,000 × 772\r\n\r\nHence we see that\r\n\r\n_The energy liberated in the contraction of the sun from infinity to its\r\npresent dimensions, is as great as could be produced by the combustion\r\nof 3,400 globes of coal, each as heavy as the sun._\r\n\r\nWe may speak of 3,400 in this case as the coal equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. ON THE FURTHER CONTRACTION OF THE SUN AND THE HEAT THAT MAY THUS BE\r\n                               GIVEN OUT.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the sun contracts to the radius _r_, and then, as already\r\nproved, § 3, the energy it gives out is\r\n\r\n                             ⅗ (ε M^2)/_r_,\r\n\r\nbut we have\r\n\r\n                           ε M/_a_^2  =  27,\r\n\r\nwhence on contraction to the radius _r_ the total energy given out from\r\nthe commencement is\r\n\r\n                            16 M (_a_^2/_r_)\r\n\r\nThe average density of the sun at present is 1.4. Let us suppose it\r\ncondenses until it has a density ρ.\r\n\r\n                        _r_^3 ÷ _a_^3 = 1.4 ÷ ρ,\r\n\r\nwhence the energy becomes\r\n\r\n                             14 _a_ M · ∛ρ;\r\n\r\nbut the coal equivalent of 16 _a_ M has been found in § 4 to be 3,400,\r\nand hence the coal equivalent in this case is\r\n\r\n                               3,000 ∛ρ.\r\n\r\nIf we take ρ to be the density of platinum (21.5), we get a coal\r\nequivalent 8,300. This, therefore, seems to represent a major limit to\r\nthe quantity of heat which can be obtained from the condensation of the\r\nnebula from infinity into a sun of the utmost density.\r\n\r\n\r\n               § 6. ON THE PRESENT EMISSION OF SUN HEAT.\r\n\r\nAccording to Scheiner, “Strahlung und Temperatur der Sonne, Leipzig,\r\n1899,” the value of the solar constant, _i.e._ the number of cubic\r\ncentimetres of water which would be raised 1° Centigrade by the quantity\r\nof sun heat which, if there were no atmospheric absorption, would fall\r\nperpendicularly on a square centimetre, at the earth’s mean distance\r\nfrom the sun, is between 3.5 and 4.0. If we take the mean value, we have\r\n(translated into British units), the following statement:—\r\n\r\n_If at a point in space, distant from the sun by the earth’s mean\r\ndistance, one square foot was exposed perpendicularly to the solar rays,\r\nthen the sun heat that would fall upon it in one minute would raise one\r\npound of water 14° Fahr._\r\n\r\nThis shows that the solar energy emitted daily amounts to\r\n\r\n                700,000,000,000 × 4 π _a_^2 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. ON THE DAILY CONTRACTION OF THE SUN NECESSARY TO SUPPLY THE PRESENT\r\n                          EXPENDITURE OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at the radius _r_ the energy is\r\n\r\n                           16 M (_a_^2/_r_).\r\n\r\nHence for a change _dr_ it is\r\n\r\n                       –16 M (_a_^2/_r_^2) _dr_.\r\n\r\nAt its present size, accordingly, the energy given out by a shrinkage\r\n_dr_ is\r\n\r\n                               16 M _dr_.\r\n\r\nOne cubic foot of the sun averages 87 pounds, so that\r\n\r\n                          M = 4/3 π _a_^3 × 87\r\n\r\n                   16 M _dr_ = 464 × 4 π _a_^3 _dr_.\r\n\r\nWe have to equate this to the expression in the last article, and we get\r\n\r\n                _dr_ = 700,000,000,000/(464 _a_) = .65.\r\n\r\nThis is the shrinkage of the sun’s radius expressed in feet. Hence the\r\ndaily reduction of the sun’s _diameter_ is 16 inches.\r\n\r\nOne coal equivalent possesses energy represented by M × 14,000 × 772.\r\nHence we can calculate that one coal equivalent would supply the solar\r\nradiation at its present rate for about 2,800 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n              II.—THE CONSERVATION OF MOMENT OF MOMENTUM.\r\n\r\nWe give here an elementary investigation of the fundamental dynamical\r\nprinciple which has been of such importance throughout this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § 8. CASE WHERE THERE ARE NO FORCES.\r\n\r\nNewton’s first law of motion tells us that a particle in motion if\r\nunacted upon by force, will move continuously in a straight line without\r\nchange of velocity.\r\n\r\nLet A_{0}, Fig. 60, be the position of the particle at any moment. Let\r\nA_{1} be its position after the time _t_; A_{2} be the position at the\r\ntime 2_t_; A_{3} be the position at the time 3_t_, and so on.\r\n\r\nThen the first law of motion tells us that the distances A_{0} A_{1},\r\nA_{1} A_{2}, A_{2} A_{3}, A_{3} A_{4}, must form parts of the same\r\nstraight line and must be all equal.\r\n\r\nIf lines O A_{0}, O A_{1}, O A_{2}, etc., be drawn from any fixed point\r\n0, then the areas of the triangles O A_{0} A_{1}, O A_{1} A_{2}, O A_{2}\r\nA_{3}, 0 A_{3} A_{4}, will be all equal. For each area is one-half the\r\nproduct of the base of the triangle into the perpendicular O T from O on\r\nA_{0} A_{1}, and, as the bases of all the triangles are equal, it\r\nfollows that their areas are equal.\r\n\r\nThus we learn that a particle moving without the action of force will\r\ndescribe around any fixed point O equal areas in equal times.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.—FIRST LAW OF MOTION EXEMPLIFIES CONSTANT MOMENT\r\nOF MOMENTUM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe product of the mass of the particle and its velocity is termed the\r\nmomentum. If the momentum be multiplied by O T the product is termed the\r\nmoment of momentum around O. We have in this case the simplest example\r\nof the important principle known as the conservation of moment of\r\nmomentum.\r\n\r\nThe moment of momentum of a system of particles moving in a plane is\r\ndefined to be the excess of the sum of the moments of momentum of those\r\nparticles which tend round O in one direction, over the sum of the\r\nmoments of momentum of those particles which tend round O in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nIf we deem those moments in one direction round O as positive, and those\r\nin the other direction as negative, then we may say that the moment of\r\nmomentum of a system of particles moving in a plane is the algebraical\r\nsum of the several moments of momentum of each of the particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 9. A GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThe following theorem in elementary geometry will be required:—\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.—A USEFUL GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet A B and A C be adjacent sides of a parallelogram, Fig. 61, of which\r\nA D is the diagonal, and let O be any point in its plane. Then the area\r\nO A C is the difference of the areas O A D and O A B.\r\n\r\nDraw D Q and C P parallel to O A. Then O A D = O A Q, whence O A D – O A\r\nB = O B Q = O A P = O A C.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 10. RELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGE OF MOMENT OF MOMENTUM AND THE FORCE\r\n                        ACTING ON THE PARTICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.—ACCELERATION OF MOMENT OF MOMENTUM EQUALS MOMENT\r\nOF FORCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet A_{1} and A_{2}, Fig. 62, be two adjacent points on the path of the\r\nparticle, and let A_{1} Q and A_{2} R be the tangents at those points.\r\nLet S Q represent the velocity of the particle at A_{1}, and SR the\r\nvelocity of the particle at A_{2}. Then Q R represents both in magnitude\r\nand direction the change in velocity due to the force F, which we\r\nsuppose constant both in magnitude and direction, while the particle\r\nmoves from A_{1} to A_{2} in the small time _t_; we have also Q R = F\r\n_t_ ÷ _m_.\r\n\r\nComplete the parallelogram S Q R U, and let fall O P_{1}, O P_{2}, O T\r\nperpendiculars from O on S Q, S R, S U respectively. Since S Q is the\r\nvelocity of the particle when at A_{1} the moment of momentum is _m_ O\r\nP_{1} × S Q; when the particle is at A_{2} the moment of momentum is _m_\r\nO P_{2} × S R. Whence the difference of the moments of momentum at A_{1}\r\nand A_{2} is _m_ (O P_{2} × S R - O P_{1} × S Q) = 2 _m_ (O S R - O S Q)\r\n= 2 _m_ O S U = _m_ O T × S U = _m_ O T. Q R = F _t_ × O T. But in the\r\nlimit S coincides with A_{1} and A_{2}, and we see that the gain in\r\nmoment of momentum is _t_ times the moment of the force around O. Hence\r\nwe deduce the following fundamental theorem, in which, by the expression\r\nacceleration of moment of momentum, we mean the rate at which the moment\r\nof momentum increases:—\r\n\r\n_If a particle under the action of force describes a plane orbit, then\r\nthe acceleration of the moment of momentum around any point in the plane\r\nis equal to the moment of the force around the point._\r\n\r\nIf the force is constantly directed to a fixed point, then the moment of\r\nthe force about this point is always zero. Hence the acceleration of the\r\nmoment of momentum around this point is zero, and the moment of momentum\r\nis constant. Thus we have Kepler’s law of the description of equal areas\r\nin equal times, and we learn that the velocity is inversely proportional\r\nto the perpendicular on the tangent.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. IF TWO OR MORE FORCES ACT ON A POINT, THEN THE ACCELERATION OF THE\r\n MOMENT OF MOMENTUM, DUE TO THE RESULTANT OF THESE FORCES, IS EQUAL TO\r\n THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE MOMENTS OF MOMENTUM DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE\r\n                          SEVERAL COMPONENTS.\r\n\r\nLet A D, Fig. 61, be a force, and A C and A B its two components. Then,\r\nsince O A D = O A B + O A C, we see that the moment of A D around O is\r\nequal to the sum of the moments of its components. Hence we easily infer\r\nthat if a force be resolved into several components the moment of that\r\nforce around a point is equal to the algebraical sum of the moments of\r\nits several components.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of the moment of momentum around O, due to the\r\nresultant of a number of forces, is equal to the moment of that\r\nresultant around O. But, as we have just shown, this is equal to the sum\r\nof the moments of the separate forces, and hence the theorem is proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 12. IF ANY NUMBER OF PARTICLES BE MOVING IN A PLANE, AND IF THEY ARE\r\n  NOT SUBJECTED TO ANY FORCES SAVE THOSE WHICH ARISE FROM THEIR MUTUAL\r\n ACTIONS, THEN THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THEIR MOMENTS OF MOMENTUM ROUND ANY\r\n                           POINT IS CONSTANT.\r\n\r\nThis important theorem is deduced from the fact stated in the third law\r\nof motion, that action and reaction are equal and opposite. Let us take\r\nany two particles; then, the acceleration of the moment of momentum of\r\none of them, A, by the action of the other, B, will be the moment of the\r\nforce between them. The acceleration of the moment of momentum of B by\r\nthe action of A will be the same moment, but with an opposite sign.\r\nHence the total acceleration of the moment of momentum of the system by\r\nthe mutual action of A and B is zero. In like manner we dispose of every\r\nother pair of actions, and thus, as the total acceleration of the moment\r\nof momentum is zero, it follows that the moment of momentum of the\r\nsystem itself must be constant.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental principle is also known as the doctrine of the\r\nconservation of areas. It may be stated in the following manner:—\r\n\r\n_If a system of particles are moving in a plane under the influence of\r\ntheir mutual actions only, the algebraic sum of the areas swept out\r\naround a point, each multiplied by the mass of the particle, is directly\r\nproportional to the time._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. IF A PARTICLE OF MASS _m_, IS MOVING IN SPACE UNDER THE ACTION OF\r\n  ANY FORCE F, THEN THE PROJECTION OF THAT PARTICLE ON ANY FIXED PLANE\r\n   WILL MOVE AS IF IT WERE A PARTICLE OF MASS _m_ ACTED UPON BY THAT\r\n             COMPONENT OF F WHICH IS PARALLEL TO THE PLANE.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the consideration that the acceleration of the\r\nparticle parallel to the plane must be proportional to this component of\r\nF.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose a system of particles moving in space under their\r\nmutual actions. The projections of these particles on a plane will move\r\nas if they were the particles themselves subjected to the action of\r\nforces which are the projections of the actual forces on the same plane,\r\nand as the reactions between any two particles are equal and opposite,\r\nthe projections of those reactions on the plane are equal and opposite.\r\nHence the proof already given of the constancy of the moments of\r\nmomentum of a plane system, will apply equally to prove the constancy of\r\nthe moments of momentum of the projections of the particles on the\r\nplane. Hence we have the following important theorem:—\r\n\r\n_Let a system of particles be moving in space under the action of forces\r\ninternal to the system only. Let any plane be taken, and any point in\r\nthat plane, and let the momentum of each particle be projected into the\r\nplane, then the algebraic sum of the moments of these projections around\r\nthe point is constant._\r\n\r\n\r\n               § 14. ON THE PRINCIPAL PLANE OF A SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a system of particles moving under the influence of their\r\nmutual actions. Let O be any point, and draw any plane L through O. Then\r\nthe moment of momentum of the system around the point O and projected\r\ninto the plane L is constant. Let us call it S. If another plane, L´,\r\nhad been drawn through O, the similar moment with regard to L´ is S´.\r\nThus for each plane through O there will be a corresponding value of S.\r\nWe have now to show that one plane can be drawn through O, such that the\r\nvalue of S is greater than it is for any other plane. This is the\r\nprincipal plane of the system.\r\n\r\nIf _v_ be the velocity of a particle, then in a small time _t_ it moves\r\nover the distance _v t_. If _p_ be the perpendicular from O on the\r\ntangent to the motion, then the area of the triangle swept round O in\r\nthe time _t_ is ½ _p v t_, and we see that the momentum is proportional\r\nto the mass of the particle multiplied into the area swept over in the\r\ntime _t_. The quantity S will, therefore, be proportional to the sum of\r\nthe projections of the areas in L, swept over in the time _t_, each\r\nincreased in the proportion of the mass of the particle. It is easily\r\nseen that the projection of an area in one plane on another is obtained\r\nby multiplying the original area by the cosine of the angle between the\r\ntwo planes. For if the area be divided into thin strips by lines\r\nparallel to the line of intersection of the planes, then in the\r\nprojection of these strips the lengths are unchanged, while the breadths\r\nare altered by being multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the\r\ntwo planes. If, therefore, we mark off on the normal to a plane L a\r\nlength _h_ proportional to any area in that plane, then the projection\r\nof this area on any other plane L´ may be measured by the projection of\r\n_h_ on the normal to L´.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.—MOMENT OF MOMENTUM UNALTERED BY COLLISION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine the moment of momentum resolved in any plane we therefore\r\nproceed as follows: Draw a plane through O, and the tangent to the path\r\nof one of the particles, and mark off on the normal drawn through O to\r\nthis plane a length _l_ proportional to the moment of momentum. Repeat\r\nthe same process for each of the other particles with lengths _l´_,\r\n_l″_, etc., on their several normals. Suppose that _l_, _l´_, _l″_\r\nrepresent forces acting at O, and determine their resultant R. Then R,\r\nresolved along any other direction, will give the component of moment of\r\nmomentum in the plane to which that direction is normal. In any plane\r\nwhich passes through R the component of moment of momentum is zero. The\r\nplane perpendicular to R contains the maximum projection of moment of\r\nmomentum. This is the principal plane of the system which we have seen\r\nto be of such importance in connection with the nebular theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           § 15. COLLISIONS.\r\n\r\nThe conservation of moment of momentum remains true in a system, even\r\nthough there may have been actual collisions between the several parts.\r\nThis is included in the proof already given, for collisions are among\r\nthe mutual actions referred to. It may, however, be instructive to give\r\na direct proof of a particular case.\r\n\r\nLet two particles collide when meeting in the directions A P and B P\r\n(Fig. 63) respectively. Whether the particles be elastic or inelastic is\r\nquite immaterial, for in both cases the action and reaction must be\r\nequal and opposite, and take place along some line P Q. The action on\r\nthe particle moving along A P will give to it an acceleration of moment\r\nof momentum which is equal to the moment of the action around O. The\r\nacceleration of the moment of momentum coming along B P will be equal\r\nand opposite. Thus the total acceleration of the moment of momentum is\r\nzero. Hence the collision has no effect on the total moment of momentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       § 16. FRICTION AND TIDES.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that such actions as collisions cannot affect the moment\r\nof momentum of the system, neither can it be affected by friction of one\r\nbody on another. Here, as in the former case, the actions and reactions\r\nare equal and opposite, and consequently the accelerations of moment of\r\nmomentum are zero. Nor is it possible for any tidal action to affect the\r\ntotal moment of momentum of the system. Every such action must be\r\ncomposed of the effects of one particle in the system on another, and as\r\nthis must invariably produce an equal and opposite reaction the total\r\nmoment of momentum is unaltered.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n Acceleration of moment of momentum, 377\r\n\r\n Aldebaran, 27, 28\r\n\r\n Anderson, Dr., 356\r\n\r\n Andromeda, Great Nebula in, 43, 204\r\n\r\n Antinous, Cluster of stars in, 353\r\n\r\n Apteryx, Rudimentary wing-bones of, 364, 366\r\n\r\n ——, Skeleton of, 364, 366\r\n\r\n ——, The, 363, 365\r\n\r\n Arcturus, Spectrum of, 85\r\n\r\n Argon, 265\r\n\r\n Argus and surrounding stars, 103\r\n\r\n Ariel, 338\r\n\r\n\r\n Boring, The great, 123\r\n\r\n Brooks’ comet, 89\r\n\r\n Bunsen burner, The, 283\r\n\r\n Butterfly and the oak-tree, The, 15\r\n\r\n\r\n Calcium, 274\r\n\r\n Capella, Spectrum of, 61–64\r\n\r\n Carbon, 280\r\n\r\n Ceres, 311\r\n\r\n Change of moment of momentum, 375\r\n\r\n Cluster, Nebulous region round a, 33\r\n\r\n Clusters of stars, 53–60, 203\r\n\r\n —— —— of 17th magnitude, 353\r\n\r\n Coal-unit, 110\r\n\r\n Collisions, 219, 380\r\n\r\n ——, Cause of formation of nebulæ, 356\r\n\r\n Comets, 37\r\n\r\n Comet, Brooks’, 89\r\n\r\n —— of 1882, 119\r\n\r\n ——, Spectrum of, 290\r\n\r\n Common, Dr. A.
